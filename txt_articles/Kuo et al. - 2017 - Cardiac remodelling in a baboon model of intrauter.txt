Abstract Extensive rodent studies have shown that reduced perinatal nutrition programmes
chronic cardiovascular disease. To enable translation to humans, we developed baboon offspring
cohorts from mothers fed ad libitum (control) or 70% of the control ad libitum diet in pregnancy
and lactation, which were growth restricted at birth. We hypothesized that intrauterine growth
restriction (IUGR) offspring hearts would show impaired function and a premature ageing
phenotype. We studied IUGR baboons (8 male, 8 female, 5.7 years), control offspring (8 male,
8 female, 5.6 years – human equivalent approximately 25 years), and normal elderly (OLD)
baboons (6 male, 6 female, mean 15.9 years). Left ventricular (LV) morphology and systolic
and diastolic function were evaluated with cardiac MRI and normalized to body surface area.
Two-way ANOVA by group and sex (with P < 0.05) indicated ejection fraction, 3D sphericity
indices, cardiac index, normalized systolic volume, normalized LV wall thickness, and average
filling rate differed by group. Group and sex differences were found for normalized LV wall
thickening and normalized myocardial mass, without interactions. Normalized peak LV filling
rate and diastolic sphericity index were not correlated in control but strongly correlated in OLD
and IUGR baboons. IUGR programming in baboons produces myocardial remodelling, reduces
systolicanddiastolicfunction,andresultsintheemergenceofaprematureageingphenotypeinthe
heart. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the specific characteristics of cardiac
programming and early life functional decline with ageing in an IUGR non-human primate
model. Further studies across the life span will determine progression of cardiac dysfunction.

Introduction
The developmental programming hypothesis postulates
that various maternal challenges during fetal and neonatal
development, such as hypoxia (Giussani & Davidge,
2013), suboptimal maternal nutrition (Langley-Evans,
2015), maternal obesity and over-nutrition (Zambrano
& Nathanielsz, 2013; Taylor et al. 2014), alter offspring
phenotype, predisposing to a wide variety of adult-onset
conditions including hypertension and cardiovascular
disease (Barker et al. 1989; Hanson & Gluckman, 2014;
Thornburg, 2015). Reduced maternal nutrition is the
most extensively studied programming challenge and, in
experimental models, generally results in fetal intrauterine
growth restriction (IUGR) and programming of hyper-
tension and other cardiovascular disorders (Fowden et al.
2006; Yeung et al. 2014; Langley-Evans, 2015). However,
much less is known about the effects of this important
programmingchallengedirectlyontheheart.TheHarvard
nurses study, one of the first human epidemiological
studies that addressed programming resulting from low
birth weight, showed an increased incidence in stroke
and heart disease associated with low birth weight
(Rich-Edwards et al. 1997). Developmental programming
isnowatopicofmajorhumanhealthinterestinthecontext
of gene–environment interactions and the view that the
epigenome is fundamental to life course expression of
phenotype (Fowden et al. 2006; Sun et al. 2013; Tarrade
et al. 2015).
Cardiac dysfunction can be detected in utero and
in neonatal life in human IUGR offspring (Fouzas
et al. 2014). However, understanding of IUGR-induced
cardiac programming remains limited. Some measures
of compromised cardiovascular function are inversely
correlated with birth weight (Ward et al. 2004; Jones
et al. 2008). Adult humans exposed to IUGR at term
had higher systolic blood pressure and smaller aortic
dimension by ultrasound, changes with potential negative
consequences for future left ventricular performance
(Bjarneg˚
ard et al. 2013). A better understanding of
the underlying pathogenesis will allow development of
imaging biomarkers for diagnosis and offer more timely
treatment options.
Human epidemiological studies are inherently limited
by lifestyle and environmental confounds that vary
between individuals. Specifically, in the study of heart
disease variations in diet, other lifestyle choices, and
variouscomorbidconditions,suchasobesityanddiabetes,
can limit our understanding of the individual variables
responsible for specific long-term outcomes. Many
insights on programming of cardiovascular function by
IUGR have been carried out in polytocous altricial rodents
and polytocous pigs and sheep (Langley-Evans, 2013).
However, both reproductive and cardiovascular physio-
logies in these species are very different from humans.
Non-human
primate
experimental
models
are
indispensable for advancing fundamental knowledge in
biomedical research due to their similarities in cardio-
vascular physiology, reproduction, and development to
humans (Mastorci et al. 2009; Shively & Clarkson, 2009).
Recently we have developed the baboon as a model
for IUGR studies (Nathanielsz et al. 2009, Cox et al.
2013) developing offspring cohorts of baboon mothers
fed ad libitum (control, CTL) or 70% ad libitum feed in
pregnancy and lactation (IUGR). Both male and female
offspring of restricted mothers were IUGR, weighing 89%
of control offspring at birth (Li et al. 2013b) and showed
programming of their phenotype, e.g. altered cognitive
(Keenan et al. 2013) and metabolic function (Choi et al.
2011).
In addition to its direct effects on the heart,
several investigators have hypothesized that programming
accelerates ageing (Rodr´
ıguez-Gonz´
alez et al. 2014;
Tarry-Adkins and Ozanne, 2014; Alexander et al. 2015;
Zambrano et al. 2015). In this study we investigated the
hypothesis that IUGR in our baboon model produces
measureable maladaptive cardiac physiology changes
with similarities to normal cardiac ageing. Our aim
was to demonstrate that moderate nutrient reduction
during perinatal development alters cardiac structure
and function, leading to abnormal cardiac remodelling.
We used cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI), a
well-established method of delineating cardiac changes of
ageing and subclinical heart disease in humans (Hees et al.
2002; Thiele et al. 2002; Maceira et al. 2006a,b; Germans
et al. 2007). Our aim was to assess subclinical biomarkers

for impaired cardiac function in young adult IUGR,
age-matched controls and elderly baboons in an attempt
to uncover similarities and differences in programming by
IUGR to the mechanisms of normal ageing.
Methods
Ethical approval
All procedures were approved by the University of Texas
Health Science Center and Texas Biomedical Research
Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees
(IACUC) and conducted in Association for Assessment
and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care approved
facilities. The IACUC is accredited by the Association for
Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care
International.
Animal model
Baboons (Papio species) were studied. Baboons were
maintained in an outdoor group social environment
and fed using an individual feeding system described
previously in detail (Schlabritz-Loutsevitch et al. 2004).
Healthy gravid female baboons of similar age and weight
were randomly assigned to an ad libitum diet during
pregnancy and lactation or a globally reduced diet regimen
consisting of 70% of feed eaten at the same stage of
gestation by control ad libitum fed mothers from 0.16
gestation (G) (Li et al. 2013a).
Blood pressure measurement and calculation
Blood pressure data were acquired in the IUGR and CTL
groups with the Omron HBP-1300 professional blood
pressure monitor, using either a small (17–22 cm) or a
medium (22–32 cm) cuff as appropriate. Prior to blood
pressure measurement, baboons were isolated and sedated
with intramuscular ketamine injection (10 mg kg–1).
Each baboon was placed in the supine position and the
cuff positioned on the upper left arm. Blood pressure
measurements began within 6 min of ketamine injection.
Sixmeasurementsweremadeoneachsubject,separatedby
1–2min,withthecuffcompletelyloosened.Measurements
could not be made on one IUGR female, due to ketamine
insensitivity. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was calculated
as the average blood pressure divided by the number of
cardiac cycles.
Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging
Cardiac
magnetic
resonance
imaging
(CMRI)
was
performed on three groups of baboons, young adult
IUGR baboons (IUGR, n = 16, 8 male and 8 female,
aged 5.7 ± 1.3 years), age matched control baboons (CTL,
n = 16, 8 male and 8 female, aged 5.6 ± 1.3 years), and
elderly adults baboons (OLD, n = 12, 6 male and 6 female,
aged15.9±3.1years).Althoughadirectcomparisonisnot
possible across the whole life span, it is usual to multiply
baboon age by a factor of 3.5–4 to obtain an approximate
human age. To account for potential significant diurnal
effects on cardiovascular function, the studies were always
conducted at the same time of the day, in the morning
(09.00–12.00h).SubjectbaselinedataareshowninTable1.

chloride (12 mg kg–1, I.M.) followed by maintenance
with

(0.8–1.0
vol%).
Oral
intubation
was performed following anaesthesia induction for
mechanical ventilation. Subsequently, cannulation of

access
was
performed. Body temperature was maintained with
a custom-built feedback-regulated circulating water
blanket. Continuous physiological parameter monitoring
included measurements of rectal temperature, PO2,
end-tidal PCO2, electrocardiogram (EKG), blood pressure,
heart
rate
and
respiratory
rate
were
continued
throughout as well as visual assessment for respiration,
voluntary movement and mucosal coloration. Mechanical
ventilation was performed at approximately 10 strokes
min–1 and 120–180 ml stroke–1. In limited sequence
acquisitions where breath-hold was required, a brief inter-
val of hyperventilation was performed following by a
brief period of ventilation suspension, not exceeding
30 s in duration. Prompt resumption of ventilation
support was achieved following breath-holds. Mechanical
ventilation and physiological monitoring were performed
using MRI-compatible machines.
All studies were performed on a 3.0 T MRI scanner
(TIM Trio, Siemens Healthcare, Malvern, PA, USA)
with a six-channel anterior phased-array torso coil and
corresponding posterior coil elements, resulting in an
aggregate of up to 12 channels of data. Before each imaging
session, a standard quality control phantom was scanned.
Functional CMRI was performed using steady-state free
precession CMRI sequences. High temporal resolution
cine CMRI with retrospective gating was performed
(repetition time/echo time 3.0/1.5 ms, 25 cardiac phases,
matrix 144 × 192, field of view 188 × 250 mm2). Two
3-slice, cine long-axis data sets, in a right anterior oblique
view and a four-chamber view, were acquired. Afterwards,
a stack of 20–24 contiguous short-axis slices (2.5 mm
thickness, no gap) was acquired serially during repetitive
breath-holds at end expiration.
On conclusion of the CMRI scanning, isoflurane
administration was discontinued, and the subject was
slowly weaned to room air and transported to the
recovery
area.

coloration and movement was performed at regular
intervals not exceeding 15 min in duration until the
animal was alert, in a sternal position and demonstrated
control of voluntary movement. After the experiments,
the subjects were returned to the group baboon facilities.
Given CMRI is a non-invasive procedure, there was
only minimal blood loss from I.V. access. Of note, the
IUGR and CTL baboons have been maintained alive
and will be investigated in future CMRI studies while
the OLD animals have been transferred to independent
studies.
Cardiac image analyses
TheCMR42 imageanalysispackage(CircleCardiovascular,
Calgary, Alberta, Canada) was used for CMRI data
analysis. The left ventricular endocardial and epicardial
contours were traced using a semiautomatic algorithm in
a time-resolved manner, which resulted in a working left
ventricle model (Fig. 1). End-diastolic volume (EDV) and
end-systolic volume (ESV) were determined by maximum
and minimum cavum volumes, with papillary muscles
included in the LV cavity volume by convention. Myo-
cardial mass was estimated with empirical myocardial
density (1.05 g ml–1) and average of the LV myocardial
volumes at end-systole and end-diastole. Ejection fraction
(EF) was computed using EDV and ESV. Ejection and
fillingfunctionswereassessedfromtherespectivemaximal
and average downslope and upslope of the volume
time curves, giving peak LV ejection and filling rates
(PLVER, PLVFR) as well as average LV ejection and filling
rates (ALVER, ALVFR). Segmentation was performed in
accordance with the American Heart Association standard
(Cerqueira et al. 2002). Peak LV wall thickness (pWT)
at end-systole was calculated using a three-dimensional
algorithm developed to measure wall thickness always
perpendicular to the myocardium, which has been shown
to estimate true wall thickness effectively (Buller et al.
1997). Wall thickening fraction expressed as a percentage
(%WT) was defined as the ratio of the difference between
the wall thickness at end-systole and the end-diastolic wall
thickness to the end-diastolic wall thickness (Peshock et al.
1989).
The three-dimensional sphericity index (SI) is a
measure of myocardial deformation that is used as an
index of LV remodelling (Mannaerts et al. 2004). For this
study, SI was defined as the ratio of the LV volume to the
volume of a sphere having the diameter of the LV long axis,
as measured from the mitral valve plane to the endocardial
margin at the apex. The larger the SI, the more spherical
the LV.
Parameters based on dimensional measurements were
evaluated with reference to the body surface area (BSA)
(Glassman et al. 1984, Maceira et al. 2006a). BSA was
estimated using weight based models developed from
baboon studies as previously described (Leigh, 2009). For
female baboons:

Statistics
Data were analysed using R 3.2.1 statistical software (R
Core Team, 2013) and GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad
Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) and presented as
means ± standard deviation (SD) unless stated otherwise.
In boxplot figures, error bars denote the minimum and
maximum, and the boxes indicate the 25th to 75th
percentiles with median values represented by a heavy line
in the box. Furthermore, the mean is denoted by a plus
sign, and potential outliers by Tukey’s rule are depicted as
individual data points. In cases where suspected outliers
are present by Tukey’s rule graphically, we performed
Grubbs’s test (extreme Studentized deviate) to determine
if a true outlying point exists. The displayed n values
in the figures indicate the number of subjects included
in the analysis after exclusion of outliers. Normality of
distribution was assessed by the d’Agostino–Pearson test.
Two-way ANOVA was used to evaluate the null hypotheses

that there were no differences between the factors group
and sex and no significant interactions. Grouped data are
presented as box-and-whisker plots, in which the boxes
depict the interquartile range of the data. The whiskers
extend over 1.5 times the interquartile range, and black
circles depict values that lie outside that range. Post hoc
multiple comparison corrections were performed using
Tukey’s honest significance test, giving adjusted (post hoc)
P values. Pearson correlation was performed to evaluate
the null hypothesis of no significant associations between
parameters within groups, as indicated. Regression lines
are shown with dotted 95% confidence bands. Statistical
significance was set at P < 0.05.
Results
Animal model
General characteristics of the CTL, OLD and IUGR groups
are shown in Table 1. The IUGR baboons demonstrated
decreased birth weight compared to age-matched controls
(P < 0.01). The difference in body weight between
the CTL and IUGR groups was no longer apparent by
young adulthood. Birth weights for the OLD group were
unavailable.
Contraction–relaxation timing and blood pressure
measurements
Timing parameters for the CMRI study are shown in
Table 2. A significantly higher resting heart rate was
measured in females, which was present in all groups.
The duration of diastole was increased in the IUGR
group relative to CTL (P < 0.05), but no sex effect was
evident. Although diastolic duration was also longer in
OLD, significance was not reached in OLD relative to
CTL. No difference was seen between groups in systolic
duration. There were no differences in systolic blood
pressure, diastolic blood pressure, or MAP between the
IUGR and CTL baboons (Table 3). Resting heart rate in
female baboons was again significantly greater than in
malesduringthebloodpressuremeasurements(P<0.01).
Left ventricular function and morphology
CMRI-measured LV functional parameters are presented
in Table 4 for the CTL, OLD and IUGR groups. Left
ventricular parameters that differed only between groups
included EF, end-systolic (ES)-SI, end-diastolic (ED)-SI,
cardiac index (CI; cardiac output (CO)/BSA), ESV/BSA,
pWT/BSA, and ALVFR/BSA. In the OLD and IUGR

groups, EF was lower than CTL (POLD: NS, PIUGR < 0.01)
and both ES-SI (POLD: NS, PIUGR < 0.001) and ED-SI
(POLD = 0.001, PIUGR < 0.01) were higher compared to
CTL, with the ES-SI values of the IUGR being markedly
larger than either CTL or OLD groups (Fig. 2). The
apparent outlier by Tukey’s rule in the CTL group was
determined to be not a statistically significant outlier
by Grubbs’s test. Statistical outliers were identified in
the IUGR group with ejection fraction and end-diastolic
sphericity index (Fig. 2). After removal of these outliers,
normality of distribution was found in all measured
parameters. The statistical values, described above, were
obtained after removal of the outlier. However, for the
sake of completeness, those values are left in place in the
graphical figures.
A difference between groups in cardiac index (CO/BSA)
was present by ANOVA due to the combined effect
of decreased CI in the IUGR (P = 0.02) and OLD
(P = 0.04) groups compared to CTL (Fig. 3A). Grubbs’s
test confirmed the presence of an outlier in the IUGR
group, which was excluded from analysis. On the other
hand, the apparent outlier in the CTL group was
determined by Grubbs’s test to not be a statistically
significant outlier. Normalized ESV/BSA was higher in the
IUGR group (P < 0.05, Fig. 4A). Normalized pWT was
also lower in both the IUGR (P < 0.05) and OLD groups
(P < 0.01) compared to CTL (Fig. 3B). ALVFR/BSA was
lower in IUGR (P < 0.05) and OLD (P < 0.05) relative
to CTL. Lower PLVFR values, seen in the IUGR and
OLD group compared to CTL, approached significance
(P = 0.09).
The parameters with between-sex differences were
further sub-analysed and are displayed in Table 5.
Left ventricular parameters that differed by sex only
after normalization to BSA included stroke volume and
end-diastolic volume. The stroke volumes in females
remained smaller than in males in all three groups.
Likewise,EDV/BSAwashigherinmalesinallgroups.After
adjusting to myocardial mass, no significant sex difference
persisted.
LV parameters that showed differences by both group
and sex factors included myocardial mass (MM)/BSA
and %WT. MM/BSA was lower in females compared to
males in all three groups (POLD < 0.05, PCTL < 0.05,
PIUGR < 0.001) (Fig. 5). MM/BSA values were lower in the
OLD compared to CTL (P < 0.05). A similar trend that
did not reach significance was noted in IUGR compared
to CTL, likely to be due to pronounced variability in
the male IUGR group (Fig. 5A). Two-way ANOVA of
the %WT values revealed significant differences between
groups (P < 0.005) and between sexes (P < 0.01),
but no group-sex interaction. The females demonstrated
significantlylower%WT(P<0.05),whiletheIUGR%WT
values were significantly lower than both CTL (P < 0.001)
and OLD (P = 0.01). A significant difference was found
both between the CTL males and IUGR males (P < 0.01)
and between CTL females and IUGR females (P < 0.05,
Fig. 5B).

There was a significant negative correlation of ESV/BSA

all groups with the scatter plot stratifying the IUGR group
as having generally high ESV/BSA and low %WT (Fig. 4B).
Correlation analyses were performed on each group
between normalized LV peak filling rates and diastolic
sphericity. As shown in Fig. 6A, there was no correlation
between these two parameters in CTL (r = 0.14, NS). A
strong correlation between these parameters (r = 0.81,
P < 0.001) was present in IUGR baboons (Fig. 6B),

P < 0.0001). In the OLD group, there was a weaker
but significant positive correlation (r = 0.69, P < 0.01)
between PLVFR/BSA and ED-SI (Fig. 6C).
To determine whether cardiac dysfunction, seen in
young adulthood, can be traced to the extent of
intrauterine growth, interaction plots between birth
weights and normalized PLVFR were generated (Fig. 7).
A positive correlation was seen between birth weight and
normalized PLVFR in the IUGR group (r = 0.56, P < 0.05,
Fig. 7). No significant correlation was observed in the CTL
group (r = 0.15, NS).

security is a significant problem, even in economically
advanced
countries
(Coleman-Jensen
et
al.
2014;
Lambie-Mumford and Dowler, 2014; Pfeiffer et al. 2015).
IUGR is a very important obstetric complication with
an incidence that varies according to socio-economic,
ethnic and other factors. The baboon has many strengths
as an experimental species to study developmental
programming. In terms of maternal physiology, like
women, pregnant baboons carry only a single fetus
in contrast to polytocous species. This distinction is
important in relation to the higher nutritional burden
experienced in pregnancy by polytocous compared with
monotocous species. In addition, the genetic similarity
between baboons and humans, evident in overall DNA
sequence and individual gene sequence identity and
arrangement of genetic loci on chromosomes, reflects the
close evolutionary relationship between these two species
(Rogers, 2000).
Our data revealed systolic dysfunction, diastolic
dysfunction and remodelling of the left ventricle in
baboons that were IUGR as a result of exposure to
moderate perinatal maternal nutrient restriction. The
systolic dysfunction is characterized by decreased EF,
decreased wall thickening, decreased peak wall thickness
and decreased cardiac index. Diastolic impairment
is marked by reduced LV filling rates, prolonged
diastolic filling times, and borderline impaired ventricular
relaxation during active filling. LV remodelling is
evidenced
by
increased
globular
morphology
and
increased end-systolic and end-diastolic LV volumes.
Overall, many of the changes resulting from IUGR
parallel those observed in the OLD animals (Table 6).
The observed functional differences in the IUGR group
are more modest than those characterizing clinical
heart failure (Kitzman, 2002) and may better represent
the lower limit of the normal functional range, pre-
senting opportunities for early diagnosis of future disease.
However, they are consistent and indicative of a decrease
in cardiac function in young adulthood to a level
comparable to or even exceeding the effects of later
ageing. Even though we examined both male and female
baboons, the majority of our findings are not sexually
dimorphic after normalization to BSA except for resting
heart rate, normalized myocardial mass and fractional
wall thickening, which were significantly different by
sex.
The results of the current study are consistent with
persistent impairment of systolic function and reduced
ejection force that have previously been reported in
growth-restricted children and fetuses (Rizzo et al.
1995; Crispi et al. 2010). Likewise, our findings of
diastolic dysfunction suggest the previously reported
diastolic disturbance and impaired ventricular filling
in IUGR human neonates and small for gestational
age human fetuses persist into adulthood (Miyague
et al. 1997; Fouzas et al. 2014). While the mechanism
underlying those dysfunctions is not yet clearly under-
stood, previous examination on human IUGR fetal myo-
cellular ultrastructure indicates that shortened sarcomere
length may contribute to the aberrant ejection function
(Iruretagoyena et al. 2014). Similarly, in studies of sheep
where cardiomyocyte maturation occurs prenatally, as
in humans, IUGR and birth weight have been shown
to affect the number of cardiomyocytes. The timing of
cardiomyocyte maturation is thought to contribute to
systolic dysfunction, depending on the method of IUGR
induction (Bubb et al. 2007; Stacy et al. 2009; Botting
et al. 2014). Additionally, irregular calcium handling and
cardiac contraction function have been demonstrated in
male nutrient-restricted IUGR rats (Harvey et al. 2015).
We have reported increased extracellular fibrosis in fetal
male IUGR baboon myocardial tissue, which may be
related to impaired LV diastolic function (Maloyan et al.
2014). While the chronology of dysfunction is difficult to

assessduetotheintricateinteractionsofthecardiovascular
system, it is interesting to note that the reduced birth
weights produced by our methods correlated best with
poorer filling function, hinting that diastolic dysfunction
may be a primary effector. This trend toward impaired
diastolic function has previously been noted in chick
embryos incubated under hypoxia (Itani et al. 2016).
This is the first study on effects of any degree of
perinatal under-nutrition on adult offspring cardiac
function in a non-human primate model. Our model
offers many advantages, including well-controlled degree
of nutritional challenge, matching of the maternal
phenotypes (Li et al. 2013b), the presence of a single
fetus and offspring to rear in baboons compared to the

large litters in polytocous species (including rodents),
genetic similarity to humans (Rogers et al. 2000), and
precocial fetal and neonatal development that results in
a developmental trajectory closer to that of humans.
The ability to precisely induce IUGR and control groups
experimentally provides further benefits over a similar
study on a large cohort of humans, where many
confounders (e.g. smoking and different diets) must
be taken into account. Most published animal studies
on cardiac function in the setting of perinatal nutrient
restriction have focused on rat models of IUGR, with
a few studies reported on mice (Kawamura et al. 2007;

Cai et al. 2012), rabbits (Gonzalez-Tendero et al. 2013),
chicks (Itani et al. 2016) and sheep (Stacy et al. 2009;
Botting et al. 2014). While the results regarding IUGR
cardiac function have not always been entirely congruent,
we should keep in mind that many aspects of development
differ across species and the method for IUGR induction
often also differ across studies. Historically, the major
interventionsthathavebeenusedtoproduceexperimental
IUGR include hypoxia, procedural interruption of uterine
function or vascular supply, malnutrition (often in
the form of a low-protein maternal diet), and global
under-nutrition to various extents, as in the present study.
There is particular interest in comparing the results of
the present study with those from the body of work that
focused on directly measuring the effects of IUGR on
cardiac function in other models. Ex vivo Langendorff
perfusion heart studies have been conducted to examine
influences of IUGR on myocardial function in a setting
that aims to address intrinsic factors within the heart and
remove extra-cardiac factors.
Using the ischaemia–reperfusion paradigm, impaired
IUGR cardiac function recovery is noted in at least two of
these studies, cementing the notion of abnormal cardiac
health with IUGR (Xu et al. 2006; Rueda-Clausen et al.
2010). In the study by Xu et al. (2006) effects of both
hypoxia and nutrient restriction IUGR are compared.
The myocardia of animals in both treatment groups
developed thickening of the extracellular matrix. Diastolic
dysfunction was impaired, and LV end-diastolic pre-
ssures increased, in line with our observation of diastolic
dysfunction. In another report of hypoxia-induced IUGR
in male rats, a significant increase in the LV ejection
pressure rate and increased rate–pressure product were
noted compared to controls, consistent with decline in
cardiac performance and increase myocardial work load
(Giussani et al. 2012). These observations also agree with
our findings. Offspring systolic and diastolic dysfunction

are both noted in the hypoxic IUGR chick model, as well
as decreased LV wall to lumen ratio and wall volume,
similar to our findings (Itani et al. 2016). Rueda-Clausen
et al. (2010) demonstrated increased normalized heart
weight in their hypoxia-induced IUGR male rats, but
not female rats, a finding we did not observe with the
moderate nutritional challenge in the baboon. However,
we note that LV hypertrophy is observed in the hypo-
xia group but not with nutrient restriction in the study
of Xu et al. (2006), in agreement with the lack of effect
on normalized myocardial mass seen in our study. In
the chick model, a difference in heart weight is not seen
after normalization to embryo weight (Itani et al. 2016).
Furthermore, Xu et al. reported an apparent delay in
remodelling of the nutrient restriction group (visible at
7 months) compared to the hypoxia group (visible at 4
months), further confirming there are key differences in
timing and degree of outcomes in response to the various
challenges that produce IUGR. This is not surprising
and, while it suggests caution in interpreting the different
outcomes, the variability also may provide clues to both
common and different mechanisms.
Results from in vivo cardiac functional studies of IUGR
are mixed. In the study by Cheema et al. (2005) in
a low-protein rat model, a minimally thinner LV wall
was noted in the low-protein group along with severely
depressed EF up to only 2 weeks of age, after which
the ventricular wall progressively thickened, exceeding
that of controls, and EF normalized. A more spherical
morphology of the heart was reported but only to
12 weeks of age, not up to 28 more weeks after. In the
rat study by Mendendez-Castro et al. (2014), however,
low protein IUGR decreased EF, increased end-systolic
and end-diastolic diameters, and decreased wall thickness
discernible at 70 days of age. In studies by Zohdi
et al. (2011, 2013, 2014) with a protein restriction rat
model, no baseline cardiac dysfunction was evident in
the low protein IUGR group at 14 weeks of age except
for reduced end-diastolic volume, but attenuated stroke
volume and cardiac output were seen with a dobutamine
challenge, and myocardial tissue had increased lipid,
proteoglycan and carbohydrate content compared to
controls. Together, these studies suggest the development
of functional cardiac impairments may occur in stages
in the various rodent studies, but preclude direct and
meaningful comparisons to our findings. Furthermore,
we again note that the physiology of IUGR by protein
restriction versus moderate nutrient restriction should not
necessarily be considered equivalent.
The LV remodelling observed in our model manifests
as a more globular morphology. This finding has been
previously reported in other IUGR models. The positive
correlation between end-diastolic sphericity index and
peak filling rate in the IUGR and OLD groups is inter-
preted as a compensatory morphological acclimation

that leads to preservation of the filling function. A
similar globular appearance of the ventricle has been
reported in both human IUGR fetuses and rodent models
(Crispi et al. 2010, 2014; Menendez-Castro et al. 2014).
Remarkably, whereas increased end-systolic sphericity
index and associated elevated normalized end-systolic
volume were observed with IUGR, no similar appreciable
change was noted in the OLD animals. We speculate
that the end-systolic differences between IUGR and OLD
may be partially attributed to the physiological algorithm
that controls remodelling and compensation. Compared
to the gradual process of ageing, the results from other
studies indicate that the stress of IUGR physiology starts
early and may consist of more radical modifications.
It is possible that while the LV of the OLD animals
can gradually accommodate for the decreased systolic
function via ventricular hypertrophy to increase contra-
ctility, rapid IUGR LV development prohibits this type of
acclimation.Eventhoughnotsuggestiveofthishypothesis,
the relative sparing of the ejection fraction, increased peak
wall thickness, and increased wall thickening fraction in
OLD animals are supportive of this premise. It will be
of interest to re-examine the IUGR baboon hearts at
a later time point to see whether such compensatory
thickening of the LV wall occurs given sufficient time.
Progressive thickening of the thinner IUGR LV wall with
age accompanied by normalization of EF has been pre-
viously reported in a rodent study (Cheema et al. 2005).
However, in that experiment, EF normalizes and wall
thickness exceeds normal by adulthood.
Thereareanumberofdifferencesinthecardiacfunction
parameters measured in this baboon model compared to
those previously reported in adult reduced-protein IUGR
ratmodels.Inonestudy,nodifferencesbetweenIUGRand
control groups were found in the values of CO, SV, or LV
cardiac dimensions (Zohdi et al. 2011). In another study,
no differences were reported between male IUGR and
male controls for CO, LV wall size, and internal diameters
during systole and diastole, yet MAP was increased and
the rate of change in pressure were down during LV
ejection and filling (Cheema et al. 2005). We suspect
the difference in our findings may partly originate from
differences in analytic technique. The heart weights of the
above-mentioned studies have been reported as decreased
in the IUGR groups, whereas we have only observed a
trend of decrease myocardial mass after normalization to
BSA. We note that BSA-adjusted measurements of heart
function are not typically performed in rodent studies of
cardiac function. In humans, multivariate analyses have
shown that BSA is a significant independent variable
influencing many CMRI cardiac parameters (Maceira
et al. 2006b). Nonetheless, this difference in technique
does not account for the lack of EF difference detected
by those studies. It is unclear whether physiological
differences between rodents and primates, types of IUGR
interventions used and differences in precisions of the
measurements further complicate the comparison.
Many previous studies on cardiovascular effects of
IUGR models have focused on measuring blood pressure,
often reporting hypertension in the affected offspring.
Various
hypotheses
have
been
generated
involving
epithelial dysfunction, abnormal vascular smooth muscle
characteristics and change in myocardial tissue properties,
such as reduced vasodilatation capacity leading to hyper-
tension (Brawley et al. 2003) and aortic wall thickening
leading to impaired vascular reactivity (Camm et al. 2010).
The losses in cardiac function that we found in this study
andattributedtoIUGRarepresentintheabsenceofhyper-
tension. Due to the prevalence of hypertension in many
human epidemiological and rodent IUGR studies, there
has long been an assumption that cardiac impairment
is secondary to hypertension in IUGR (Alexander et al.
2015). However, the evidence for the dependence of heart
function on hypertrophy in protein deprived rat models

has been mixed, similar to recent rat models that try to
account for the physiological differences between rats and
humans (Zohdi et al. 2014). Given our results, if hyper-
tension is an immediate consequence in the moderately
nutrient-restricted IUGR baboons, it is either below the
threshold of detection or moderated over time and absent
by adulthood. Further, given that blood pressure varies
greatly with stress, anaesthesia and timing, we have to
consider that the previous measurements of hypertension
in IUGR models were measured under conditions with
very different physiological states.
We hypothesize that in our model, the development
of impaired myocardial function without chronic hyper-
tension is due to the development of diffuse myocardial
fibrosis. Stiffening of the myocardium and impaired
systolic and diastolic functions are known consequences
of increased fibrotic tissue deposition (Weber et al. 1993).
In addition, a shortening of myocardial sarcomeres may
have occurred, further compromising systolic function
(Iruretagoyenaetal.2014).Wespeculatethattoameliorate
LV relaxation failure due to decreased compliance,
structural expansion of the LV occurs, preserving the EDV
and decreasing wall stress while developing a globular
ventricular morphology (Fig. 8). The adaptive feature of
this remodelling is supported by the positive correlation
found between peak diastolic filling rate and diastolic
sphericity index (Fig. 7). These intra-cardiac changes
are likely to be part of a more comprehensive response

cardiac pathophysiology
Myocardial fibrosis results in altered end-diastolic pressure–volume
relationship (EDPVR; 1). Increased pressure is thus required for
diastolic filling (2). Increased ventricular cavity size and concomitant
decreased ventricular compliance result in minimal end-diastolic
volume change (3). Increased afterload is observed in IUGR, as
previously documented (4). Combined effects of increased afterload,
increased ventricular cavity size and decreased systolic function are
evidenced by increased residual/end-systolic volume (5). A reduced
stroke volume is seen given the increased post-ejection residual
volume and unchanged end-diastolic volume (6).
to IUGR, which may include other well-documented
phenomena, such as the increased renin–angiotensin
activity reported in human fetuses (Tsyvian et al. 2008).
Unfortunately, given the lack of tissue at this stage of
our study, we cannot yet comment on some physiologic
responses that have been proposed to occur in IUGR,
such as increased oxidative stress (Giussani et al. 2012;
Kane et al. 2013; Nascimento et al. 2014; Vega et al. 2016,
Itani et al. 2016) and endothelial and vascular dysfunction
(Allison et al. 2016).
We acknowledge several limitations of this study. First,
we should note that our evaluation is performed under
anaesthesia, which is not without effects on cardio-
vascular function. In this study, we induce anaesthesia
with ketamine, which is known for producing fewer effects
on the cardiovascular system compared to other available
agents, such as propofol or midazolam (Stowe et al. 1992).
Similarly, of the many inhalational anaesthetics available,
isoflurane has been shown to produce less impact to
cardiovascular status (Kazama & Ikeda, 1988, Oguchi
et al. 1995). Given that IUGR offspring are known to
have increased sympathetic tone (Lee et al. 1998) and that
ketamine has a sympathomimetic property that enhances
the release of plasma catecholamine (Carruba et al. 1987),
it is thought that the measured cardiac function decline
being due to differing effects of anaesthesia between
groups is unlikely. However, we cannot exclude the pre-
sence of paradoxical effect, and further studies may be
warranted.
Secondly, we acknowledge the age disparity in our
OLD animals. The OLD female baboons are several years
younger than the OLD male baboons (13.6 ± 1.4 vs.
18.2 ± 2.6 years). While these age ranges both correlate
to mid-to-late adulthood, this difference may impact
some of our obtained measurements. Fortunately, when
examining the parameters where sex differences were
found (Table 5), no measurement stands out as likely to
be strongly affected by this age difference in our OLD
animals.
We should further note that by literature both sexes
of the baboons have reached sexual maturity at age of
5.7. However, we did not measure sex hormones for
confirmation. It is possible that delayed sexual maturation
confounds our results on cardiac function, as it has been
previously suggested that IUGR delays onset of puberty
(Engelbregt et al. 2000). Nevertheless, we should further
note that our findings of IUGR do not parallel that seen
in paediatric patients. For example, a stable to minimally
increased EF and mildly decreased normalized ESV are
observed in normal human children (Poutanen et al.
2003) whereas we observed decreased EF and increased
normalized ESV.
Also, the methodology used for determining ventricular
volumesincludedpapillarymusclesaspartofthelumenby
convention. Although this approach affects the accuracy
C

of the measurement, it has been adopted as a convention
to provide superior reproducibility (Papavassiliu et al.
2005). Lastly, the animals have metal identification tags
implanted in their backs, which would sometimes cause
artifacts that required interpolation from more basal or
apical slices. Visually, this has not been a significant issue
with performing measurements on the obtained images.
In this study, we have exploited the advantages of
CMRI as a non-invasive method for determining cardiac
function, resulting in clinically relevant parameters that
are ready for translation. We have uncovered systolic
dysfunction, diastolic derangement and morphological
remodelling of the left ventricle in a baboon model in early
adulthood. These findings suggest the previously reported
cardiac abnormalities do indeed occur in primates and
that at least some cardiac abnormalities of IUGR human
neonates do persist into adulthood. Many of the IUGR
findings parallel those of the OLD animals, but literature
suggests divergent pathways governing those apparently
similar changes. Although there are some inconsistencies
between our findings and those of other animal models,
we speculate that after accounting for species differences,
varying effects of IUGR methods, timing of examination
and normalization to BSA or MM, the non-uniformity in
findings reported may simply reflect different aspects of
