 Setting—Population of approximately one million in the Northwestern US (2002–2012).
Patients—Middle-aged residents (35–65 years) suffering from SCA.
Measurement—Multiple sources assessment of symptoms in the four weeks preceding SCA and 
association with survival to hospital discharge.
Results—Of 839 SCA patients with comprehensive assessment of symptoms (51±12 years, 75% 
male), 430 patients (51%; 50% male vs. 53% female, P=0.59) experienced warning symptoms, 
mainly chest pain and dyspnea. In the majority of symptomatic patients (93%), symptoms recurred 
during the 24 hours preceding SCA. Only 81 patients (19%) called emergency medical services 
(911) to report symptoms prior to SCA; these were more likely to be patients with a history of 
heart disease (P<0.001) and/or continuous chest pain (P<0.001). Survival when 911 was called in 
response to symptoms was 32.1% (95%CI 21.8–42.4), compared to 6.0% (95%CI 3.5–8.5) in 
those who did not call (P<0.001). This association remained after considering potential 
confounders.
Limitations—Potential for recall and response bias; symptom assessment not available in 24% 
patients; missing data for some patients and SCA characteristics.
Conclusions—Warning symptoms are frequent prior to SCA but the vast majority of these are 
not acted upon. Emergent medical care was associated with survival in patients with symptoms, 
emphasizing a potential role for future approaches that enable short-term prevention of SCA.

Introduction
Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is commonly perceived by the lay and medical communities as 
a sudden unexpected collapse, without warning. With more than 550,000 individuals of SCA 
occurring pre-hospital and in-hospital annually in the United States, SCA accounts for over 
half of cardiovascular mortality, and is a major public health issue.(1, 2)
Survival after SCA remains very low and stable (approximately 7%), despite major 
investments by the medical and research communities in this area over the past decades.(3) 
Furthermore, efforts to improve prediction of individuals at long-term risk for SCA are still 
awaited and in this context, alternative approaches aimed at pre-emptive risk stratification 
and prevention are needed.(1, 4, 5) Sentinel events preceding SCA may be of special 
interest, in light of recent advances in communication and remote transmission technologies.
(6) (7) We hypothesized that “warning events” in the hours, days and weeks prior to SCA 
might identify a subgroup of SCA patients in whom timely and early intervention could 
impact outcome.
Investigation of SCA remains particularly challenging, especially since a great majority of 
patients die in the field, and consequently the information collected by Emergency Medical

 Services (EMS) is often restricted to data regarding the resuscitation process. Details of the 
past medical history of SCA patients (especially those who cannot be resuscitated) are thus 
usually sparse and very rarely considered systematically. In the Oregon-SUDS, we collected 
information on symptoms as well as clinical history for all SCA patients including those 
who died before reaching hospital.
We therefore conducted a comprehensive assessment of warning symptoms in the four 
weeks prior to SCA in a large prospective community based study of deceased and surviving 
SCA patients in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area. We hypothesized that presence and 
response to warning symptoms may be associated with a better survival from SCA.
Methods
Setting, Definitions and Survey Methods
The Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study (Oregon-SUDS) is an ongoing community 
based prospective study of out of hospital SCA. Detailed methods have been published 
previously.(8–11) Briefly, since February 1, 2002,of SCA in the Portland Oregon 
metropolitan area were identified using multiple sources that included a two-tiered 
emergency medical response system, the medical examiner’s office and emergency 
departments of all local hospitals. This study was approved by the relevant Institutional 
Review Boards including Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles CA and Oregon Health 
and Science University, Portland, OR.
Sudden cardiac arrest was defined as an unexpected loss of the pulse without obvious extra-
cardiac cause, occurring with a rapid collapse and with specific resuscitation records 
available. SCAs occurring in the setting of a prior terminal condition, such as malignancy 
not in remission or end-stage chronic obstructive lung disease, were excluded. At the time of 
adjudication, three physicians had access to lifetime medical history with all available 
hospital and outpatient medical records, including information on prior symptoms.
Variables considered in the present analysis included demographics, circumstances of 
occurrence as well as resuscitation data according to the revised Utstein style.(12) In 
addition to the data from EMS and the medical examiner, a working group of the Oregon-
SUDS collected and assessed the lifetime past medical history for both deceased patients 
and survivors, including symptoms assessment prior to SCA, through review of records of 
all inpatient/outpatient visits from the Portland area hospitals. The principal outcome was 
survival to hospital discharge, available in all cases.
Assessment of Symptoms Prior to SCA
Characterization of symptoms and their frequency was performed during the four weeks 
prior to SCA, among patients aged 35–65 years, adjudicated from February 2002 to 
February 2012. The data on symptoms was collected by the Oregon-SUDS investigators 
based on information documented by the EMS team (in the field), intensivists or 
cardiologists (at the 16 hospitals), and physicians (in the community). Symptom assessment 
recorded on the EMS pre-hospital care report was derived from multiple sources, including 
information provided by family at the scene, witnesses, and survivors of SCA. In addition,

 available hospital and outpatient medical records for all patients were systematically 
analyzed for information regarding symptoms.
Symptoms were categorized as absent, present or not evaluable based on the extent of 
information available, and the agreement of investigators. Symptoms were considered 
“absent” when (i) there was no record of any medical consultation during the four weeks 
preceding SCA, (ii) at least one of the other sources specifically ascertained the absence of 
any complaints, and (iii) none of the other sources reported any symptoms. Symptoms were 
considered as “present” if they were documented by at least one of the above sources. Of 
note, symptoms starting immediately prior to the SCA event (symptoms with instantaneous 
collapse) were considered as “no symptoms” since they would have been unlikely to lead to 
any early intervention.
Symptoms were classified as (i) chest pain (sub-classified as typical and atypical), (ii) 
dyspnea, (iii) palpitations, (iv) syncope, and (v) other (including abdominal pain, nausea/
vomiting, back pain and other miscellaneous symptoms). Finally, the presence of ongoing 
typical influenza-like symptoms was also evaluated. In cases of multiple symptoms 
(combined symptoms), chest pain was designated as the principal symptom when present. 
Time intervals from the onset of a symptom to SCA were categorized into four groups, 
where possible (98%): (i) within the first hour, (ii) within the hours before SCA (up to 24 
hours), (iii) within the days before SCA (up to seven days), and (iv) within the weeks (up to 
four weeks) before SCA.
Symptoms were considered as not acted upon if patients or relatives/witnesses did not 
attempt to contact EMS (911) in response to symptoms that occurred prior to SCA.
Statistical Analysis
This report was prepared in compliance with the STROBE checklist for observational 
studies.(13,14) The characteristics of SCA were reported as mean (standard deviation), 
proportions, median and interquartile ranges, as appropriate. Comparisons between groups 
used the chi-square test for categorical variables and the Student t test for continuous 
variables. A logistic regression model was used to compare survival to hospital discharge by 
911 call in those with symptoms. Covariates included age and sex, and meaningful 
independent variables according to Utstein guidelines(12). Missing values for covariates 
were accounted for using multiple imputations (mi impute) by chained equations. 
Imputation models included terms for age, gender, location, witnessed-CPR status, initial 
rhythm, timing, onset, diabetes, dyslipidemia, BMI, hypertension, current smoking, coronary 
artery disease, time to intervention, in addition to the outcome. We used ten imputations and 
Rubin’s rules to combine the results.(15,16) The results were similar to those from a 
complete cases analysis and so only results using multiply imputed data are presented as 
primary results. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the relationship between 
survival and 911 call, with additional adjustment for possible confounding due to hospital or 
time period (before and after 2005). Differences were assumed to be statistically significant 
for a two-tailed probability of P≤0.05. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals (CI) were 
calculated when appropriate. All data were analyzed using STATA software version v11.0 
(Lakeway Drive, TX).

Results
Frequency of Warning Signs and Associated Characteristics
Sixteen hospitals in the Portland metropolitan area were included, with the median number 
of patients per hospital of 71 (Q1:56 Q3:81). Overall, symptom data were not available for 
analysis in 260 (24%) patients, due to insufficient or conflicting documentation (Figure 1, 
Appendix 1). Reasons for not having symptom data included: (i) Absence of witness and 
relatives prior and at the time of SCA, as well as no medical report recorded in the area 
during the previous 4 weeks (166 patients), (ii) Witnesses/relatives unable to provide clear 
information in the absence of a specific medical record (69 patients), (iii) Information on 
symptoms provided by patients/witnesses/relatives considered as being too non-specific to 
make definite conclusions (23 patients), and finally (iv) Brain injury with significant 
cognitive dysfunction (2). Patients without symptom assessment were more likely to not 
have a witness (65.4% vs. 43.3%) (Appendix 2). The most common source for symptom 
information was the Oregon Emergency Medical Services, in 766 patients (91%) overall 
(Appendix 1), especially trained to get important information in the field.
Of the 839 patients with symptoms assessment, 430 patients (51%) presented with at least 
one symptom within the four weeks prior to SCA (Figure 1), with very similar frequency in 
men and women (50 vs. 53%, P=0.59). A total of 51 patients (out of the 430 with symptoms) 
had consulted a family or specialist physician during the 4 preceding weeks.
Subject characteristics according to the presence or absence of warning symptoms are 
described in Table 1. Overall, characteristics of patients with and without symptoms prior to 
SCA were similar, including past medical history. Regarding circumstances of occurrence, 
patients with symptoms (vs. no symptoms) were more likely to be at home at the time of 
SCA (76 vs. 64%, P<0.001). Response times (between 911 call and EMS arrival) were 
similar in both groups (6.9±4.1 vs. 7.0±3.2 minutes, P=0.73), without a significant 
difference in the proportion with initial shockable rhythm (49 vs. 52%, P=0.40).
Characteristics of Symptoms and Temporal Pattern
The onset of cardiovascular symptoms is summarized in Figure 2. In most individuals (334; 
80%), symptoms started more than one hour before SCA, including 147 with onset of 
symptoms more than 24 hours prior to SCA. Among those, 136 (93%) experienced recurrent 
new episodes of symptoms during the 24 hours preceding SCA.
The main symptom was chest pain, documented in 199 (46%) patients with symptoms, 
including intermittent typical angina in 151 (76%) of these. Coronary heart disease was 
previously identified in 28% of those patients with chest pain. Dyspnea was present in 78 
patients (18%). Of these, congestive heart failure or pulmonary conditions were previously 
known in 32%. Syncope or palpitations were found in 22 patients (5%) with the first episode

 homogeneously distributed during the four-week period. In 86 patients (20%), 
symptomatology was related to abdominal or other complaints. Finally, typical ongoing 
influenza-like symptoms were observed in 41 patients (10%). A significant overlap of 
symptoms was observed, notably chest pain and dyspnea; 65 patients (33%) with chest pain 
developed concomitant acute dyspnea prior to SCA occurrence. Among patients without 
chest pain, none presented with more than one symptom.
The pattern of symptoms was significantly different between men and women (Table 2), 
with men experiencing more chest pain than women, whereas women experienced more 
dyspnea (P<0.001). When the analysis was restricted to cases of SCA with documented 
coronary artery disease, women still presented with a lower frequency of chest pain (32 vs. 
58%, P=0.001).
Response to Symptoms and Relationship with Survival Outcome
Overall, among the 430 patients with preceding symptoms, 81 (19%) called EMS prior to 
SCA (Figure 1). Characteristics of patients based on their decision to call 911 are 
summarized in Table 3. Previous history of heart disease (P=0.001) and older age (P=0.021) 
were associated with 911 calls. Symptoms suggestive of cardiovascular conditions were 
more likely to be associated with 911 calls, especially continuous chest pain compared to all 
other symptoms (69 vs. 15%, P<0.001).
Among the 81 patients with symptoms who called 911, 63 (78%) developed SCA before 
arrival of emergency medical responders, whereas 18 (22%) experienced SCA in the 
ambulance on the way to hospital. Overall, compared to patients who did not call 911 prior 
to SCA, patients who did call were more frequently witnessed (P=0.001), had a higher 
proportion of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (P=0.001), and presented with a 
higher rate of initially shockable rhythm (P=0.02).
Survival to hospital discharge was 32.1% (95%CI 21.8–42.4), compared to 6.0% (95% CI 
3.5–8.5) in those who did not call 911 (P<0.001). After adjustment for differences in 
patients and resuscitation variables, and multiple imputation for missing data, 911 call 
remained significantly associated with survival to hospital discharge (OR 4.82, 95%CI 2.23–
10.43, P<0.001) (Appendix 3). A sensitivity analysis using complete case analysis found a 
significant association (OR 3.27, 95%CI 1.37–7.79, P=0.008) as did analyses that controlled 
for potential confounding due to hospital (OR 3.35, 95%CI 1.47–7.65, P=0.004) and the 
periods of time prior to and after year 2005 (OR 5.64, 95%CI 2.59–12.43, P=0.001).
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first comprehensive evaluation of the extent to 
which a patient’s or their family’s response to symptoms in the four weeks preceding SCA, 
is associated with survival. Several key points emerge from this study. Firstly, there is a 
relatively high frequency of warning signs preceding SCA in middle age, when evaluation is 
extended to the four weeks preceding SCA. Second, these symptoms appear to be frequently 
ignored or minimized by patients in the community, with at least two-thirds of affected 
individuals not seeking urgent medical care, given that the vast majority of symptoms

 reoccurred during the 24 hour time period preceding SCA. Finally, our findings suggest that 
an early 911 call among patients with symptoms is associated with better survival, especially 
since in the majority of patients symptoms recurred in the hours immediately preceding 
SCA. These findings suggest that there may be potential for enhancing short-term prevention 
of SCA in the future.
The term “sudden” has classically suggested that collapse occurred without warning. 
Although previous community-based studies that investigated the circumstances preceding 
SCA have documented the existence of early warning symptoms in some patients,(17,18) 
these studies were mainly focused on symptoms occurring very shortly before witnessed 
SCA; and findings were limited to those collected in the field by EMS providers, and finally 
likely to underestimate the potential window for timely intervention. It is noteworthy that the 
vast majority of our patients with symptoms who eventually developed SCA, did not call for 
emergent care. This is a particularly striking finding when you consider the fact that the 
majority (>90%) of those who first experienced symptoms during the days and weeks before 
SCA, experienced recurrent symptoms during the hours preceding the event. Not 
surprisingly, patients with continuous symptoms or with known heart disease appear more 
likely to call 911, probably because of a better awareness of warning signs. However, two 
thirds of such patients did not call 911, identifying major room for improvement.(19)
Our findings emphasize the need to encourage efforts that target public awareness of SCA as 
a largely fatal event. It is important to reinforce knowledge of prodromal symptoms of SCA 
in the general public as well as patients affected by heart disease and their family members. 
The recent impressive advances in mobile telecommunication technologies leave open the 
possibility that these developments could help improve management of SCA patients with 
warning symptoms, potentially affording a unique opportunity for early intervention.(6) This 
may be particularly helpful in the subgroup of patients with known heart disease. It is 
conceivable that in this patient sub-group instant transmission of point-of-care ECGs and 
development of automated algorithms could enable comparison with baseline recordings 
stored in the mobile device.(6,7) Also, immediate geo-localization and identifying the 
location of the closest automatic external defibrillator are all technically feasible and 
potentially could be beneficial in this setting. Thus, targeted public education to enhance 
timely reporting of symptoms combined with development of systematic strategies for 
response to these symptoms, may lead to new paradigms for short-term prevention of SCA. 
Our results also demonstrate that 12% of patients had consulted a physician within the 30 
days prior SCA, and were investigated with a systematic work-up. These results also point 
out the intrinsic difficulty in estimating risk of SCA even in symptomatic patients, and 
should motivate more focused investigation in this area.
In contrast with what has been previously suggested for women,(20,21) a significant 
proportion of women in our series also had cardiac symptoms in the weeks prior to SCA. 
The overall frequency of symptoms was similar between men and women, challenging to 
some extent the traditional concept that SCA may be more difficult to predict or prevent in 
women. The pattern of symptoms, however, differed significantly, with less chest pain 
among women, even when our analysis was restricted to cases with definite coronary artery

 disease. Those results appear consistent with recent findings regarding sex differences in 
sentinel symptoms prior to myocardial infarction.(22–24)
While the concept that an early call to EMS improves survival seems intuitive, our findings 
emphasize that patients who called 911 prior to SCA more frequently had a witnessed arrest 
(22% in front of EMS), had a higher rate of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and higher 
propensity for presenting with a shockable rhythm. All these factors have been associated 
with better survival.(3) The fact that early 911 call remains associated with better survival 
after multiple adjustments on patients’ characteristics as well as circumstances of SCA, 
points to the need to further investigate the mechanisms of this association.
The findings of pre-existing symptoms correlating with higher chance of presenting with 
shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia, as opposed to PEA or asystole) are 
of interest and are likely explained by three factors. Published studies suggest that the 
patterns of prodromal symptoms we observed prior to sudden death (out-of-hospital) were 
overall similar to symptoms observed prior to non-fatal myocardial infarction,(25)suggesting 
a high proportion of coronary ischemia patients. We and others have previously reported a 
higher likelihood of shockable rhythms in patients with coronary disease.(26) Finally, the 
higher frequency of witnessed events and bystander CPR especially in the 911 call group is 
also likely to have contributed to the higher prevalence of shockable rhythms in patients with 
pre-existing symptoms.(27)
Although our results are derived from a unique and comprehensive survey of SCA survivors 
and decedents, several limitations warrant consideration. First, since symptom ascertainment 
was not possible for (24%) of our population, there is a potential for bias. In addition, there 
was missing data for many potential confounders. Multiple imputation methodology was 
used to handle data that was missing for the covariates Second, because our population is 
comprised of patients who eventually developed SCA, the benefit of any early symptom 
alerts on outcomes may be underestimated, since a number of patients with symptoms and 
timely appropriate medical management may eventually not have developed SCA. Thirdly, 
we acknowledge that the specificity of identified symptoms, possibly in combination with 
other factors, to predict imminent SCA needs further evaluation in order to finally improve 
“short-term” risk stratification. The ultimate goal would be to optimize triage by EMS or 
other health care providers. In this regard, our preliminary findings suggest that a 
combination of chest pain and dyspnea may be especially frequent, a finding that appears to 
be in agreement with previous reports indicating that the development of acute heart failure 
along with myocardial ischemia increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmias.(28) Fourth, 
although EMS remain the most important source of information collected on site, and EMS 
personnel of the Portland area, have been systematically receiving specialized training for 
information gathering in the specific setting of SCA since the early 90s, we acknowledge 
that our results with respect to the proportion of patients with symptoms may be subject to 
some recall as well as response bias. However, the influence of this potential response bias is 
likely to be low since in the setting of SCA in general but also in this evaluation, the 
proportion of survivors included in the symptoms assessment evaluation is quite small (5.6% 
in our study). Further, the influence of symptoms (leading to earlier 911 call) on survival is 
unlikely to be significantly affected by this bias since information on 911 calls was directly

 ascertained from the EMS system and did not rely on patient/family recall. Finally, such an 
observational study cannot establish a causal association, and underlying mechanisms 
behind this association between early 911 call and survival need further investigation.
In summary, a high proportion of middle-aged men and women in the community had 
warning symptoms prior to SCA, but the vast majority of these are not acted upon. Because 
timely response to such symptoms was associated with an increase in survival, our results 
highlight the potential importance of developing new community-based strategies for short-
term prevention of SCA. Further studies are needed to improve risk-stratification among 
those patients with symptoms, as well as investigations of whether early intervention based 
on symptoms may improve outcomes or even prevent SCA occurrence.
