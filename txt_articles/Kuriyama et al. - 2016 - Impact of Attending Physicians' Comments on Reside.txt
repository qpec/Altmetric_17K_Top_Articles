Abstract
Objective
To examine whether peppy comments from attending physicians increased the workload of
residents working in the emergency department (ED).
Methods
We conducted two parallel-group, assessor-blinded, randomized trials at the ED in a tertiary
care hospital in western Japan. Twenty-five residents who examined either ambulatory (J
(^o^)PAN-1 Trial) or transferred patients (J(^o^)PAN-2 Trial) in the ED on weekdays. Partici-
pants were randomly assigned to groups that either received a peppy message such as
“Hope you have a quiet day!” (intervention group) or did not (control group) from the attend-
ing physicians. Both trials were conducted from June 2014 through March 2015. For each
trial, residents rated the number of patients examined during and the busyness and difficulty
of their shifts on a 5-point Likert scale.
Results
A total of 169 randomizations (intervention group, 81; control group, 88) were performed for
the J(^o^)PAN-1 Trial, and 178 (intervention group, 85; control group, 93) for the J(^o^)
PAN-2 Trial. In the J(^o^)PAN-1 trial, no differences were observed in the number of ambu-
latory patients examined during their shifts (5.5 and 5.7, respectively, p = 0.48), the busy-
ness of their shifts (2.8 vs 2.8; p = 0.58), or the difficulty of their shifts (3.1 vs 3.1, p = 0.94).
However, in the J(^o^)PAN-2 trial, although busyness (2.8 vs 2.7; p = 0.40) and difficulty
(3.1 vs 3.2; p = 0.75) were similar between groups, the intervention group examined more
transferred patients than the control group (4.4 vs 3.9; p = 0.01).

Introduction
Emergency department (ED) personnel tend to be highly superstitious. Famous examples
include “Friday the 13th” and a full moon causing an increased number of ED visits. Although
several studies have investigated whether such associations exist, no definitive conclusions
have been reached [1–5].
One universally prevailing superstition rarely documented in the literature involves the
belief that once an upbeat or cheery comment such as "Hope you have a quiet day!" is uttered,
the ED suddenly becomes busier with an increased number of visits and admissions[6]. In
other words, uttering a cheery or peppy comment brings about the opposite effect. Due to this
prevailing superstition, residents often perceive this remark to be a jinx. This is unfortunate
because it prevents residents and attending physicians from offering positive comments to
their colleagues. To our knowledge, no studies have examined this kind of jinx in the ED
setting.
Herein, we conducted two J(^o^)PAN (Jinxes or Peps from Attendings) randomized trials
to investigate whether peppy comments from attending physicians increase the workload of
residents in the ED. If no evidence can be found for such a jinxing effect, it is hoped that resi-
dents and attending physicians can begin to have more genuine conversations.
Methods
Both J(^o^)PAN trials were single-center, parallel-group, assessor-blinded, randomized trials,
and were approved by the institutional review board at Kurashiki Central Hospital. These two
trials were registered at University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Reg-
istry (UMIN-CTR), UMIN000017193 and UMIN000017194. Residents looked through this
registry site during the lectures about clinical trials and systematic reviews given to them, and
some could know of this study conduct. Thus, we decided to reveal the study protocol after the
study ended (S1 File and S2 File). The authors confirm that these trials were to be registered.
There was no internal or external funding for this study. We followed the CONsolidated Stan-
dards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guideline (S3 File) [7].
Participants
Kurashiki Central Hospital is a 1,131-bed tertiary care hospital in western Japan. A total of
63,054 patients, including 9,125 transfers, were examined at the Kurashiki Central Hospital
ED in 2014. All postgraduate year two residents at Kurashiki Central Hospital spent two
months at the ED as part of a postgraduate training program. Each resident worked at the ED
for a two month-period as part of a five-member shift. In these shifts, two residents examined
both ambulatory and transferred patients, one examined only ambulatory patients from 9 AM

 to 5 PM, one examined only transferred patients from 2 PM to 10 PM, and the other worked as
the night float physician. The inclusion criteria for residents in the J(^o^)PAN-1 trial were
that they saw only ambulatory patients from 9 AM to 5 PM, and those for the J(^o^)PAN-2 trial
were that they saw only transferred patients from 2 PM to 10 PM. Exclusion criteria included
working on weekends, national holidays, and days when board-certified emergency physicians
were not available as attending physicians.
The attending physicians distributed questionnaires to the residents at the start of their
shifts. The questionnaires were composed of the following items regarding the residents’ work-
loads: 1) number of patients examined during the shift; 2) busyness of the shift; 3) difficulty of
the shift; 4) stress felt during the shift; 5) mealtime duration; and 6) fatigue felt at the end of
the shift. Difficulty, busyness, stress and fatigue were each rated on a 5-point Likert scale, with
“1” indicating the least and “5” the most. All questionnaires were retrieved at the end of the
shifts.
Interventions
At the start of each shift, the attending physicians received an envelope containing a command
for the shift. The command was either to give the peppy message “Hope you have a quiet day”
to the residents or to not give the message and behave as usual. The messages were given in the
preset randomization sequence described below. Consequently, all eligible residents were ran-
domly assigned to receive a peppy message (intervention group) or no message (control
group) from the attending physicians.
Randomization and blinding
The randomization sequence was created using a computerized random number generator.
The knowledge that this study was being conducted was expected to possibly bias the
answers to the questionnaire and, in turn, the study results. Therefore, written consent was
waived by the institutional review board and no residents were informed of their participation.
To avoid the disclosure, only board-certified emergency physicians (SU, NK, MI, SI, AS, and
TI) who were sufficiently “senior” to residents were selected, and the trials were conducted
only when these physicians were available as attending physicians. The attending physicians
were not blinded for logistic reasons. One ED physician (NU) was involved in the central ran-
domization of the message schedule. A secretary (TK) retrieved the questionnaires and pro-
vided data regarding the trends of the ED patients, and another ED physician (JF) made the
dataset. The other physician (AK) analyzed the data. The last three individuals were masked to
message allocation, and the randomization schedule was only revealed after the analysis was
complete.
Statistical analyses
The primary outcomes for each trial were the number of patients that the residents saw during
and the busyness and the difficulty of their shift. The secondary outcomes included the stress
felt by residents during their shift, mealtime duration, the fatigue felt by residents at the end of
their shift, number of all admissions during their shift, and number of all ambulatory and
transferred patients who visited the ED during their shift. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was
used in the analysis of visits to the ED, and the Student’s t-test was used to compare the other
outcomes between the intervention and control groups. To exclude the potential learning
effects of the participants or blunting effect of the message over time, we conducted sensitivity
analyses on the primary outcomes with the first 10 shifts of each two months. All statistical

 tests were two-sided with a significance level of p<0.05. All analyses were performed using
Stata v.11.2 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).
Results
Two J(^o^)PAN trials were conducted from June 4, 2014 through March 26, 2015. A total of
25 residents were included, and were followed up only on the relevant day. A total of 169 ran-
domizations were performed for the J(^o^)PAN-1 trial; among the residents, 81 and 88 were
assigned to the intervention and control groups, respectively. A total of 178 randomizations
were performed for the J(^o^)PAN-2 trial; among the residents, 85 and 93 were assigned to
the intervention and control groups, respectively (Fig 1). There were 7,517 ED visits (5,495
ambulatory, 2,022 transfers) during the J(^o^)PAN-1 trial session, and 13,276 (10,827 ambula-
tory, 2,449 transfers) during the J(^o^)PAN-2 trial session. Six board-certified emergency phy-
sicians served as attending physicians at similar frequencies between the groups in each trial
(Table 1). All randomized participants were included in the final analysis, and none were lost
to follow-up.
Primary outcomes
In the J(^o^)PAN-1 trial, the residents in the intervention and control groups saw an average
of 5.5 and 5.7 ambulatory patients, respectively (p = 0.48). The residents in both groups each

In the J(^o^)PAN-2 trial, the residents in the intervention group saw more transferred
patients than those in the control group (4.4 and 3.9 patients, respectively; p = 0.01). The resi-
dents from the intervention and control groups rated the busyness of their shifts at 2.8 and 2.7
(p = 0.40), respectively, and the difficulty of their shifts at 3.1 and 3.2 (p = 0.75), respectively

 Secondary outcomes
In the J(^o^)PAN-1 trial, no significant differences were found between the intervention and
control groups in stress (2.8 vs 2.9, respectively; p = 0.40), mealtime duration (17.2 min vs 17.3
min; p = 0.98), or fatigue (3.0 vs 3.0; p = 0.85) (Table 2). In addition, no significant differences
were evident in the numbers of admissions (10.4 vs 10.6; p = 0.70) or the number of ambula-
tory patients that visited the ED (median, 31 vs 32; Wilcoxon p = 0.98).
In the J(^o^)PAN-2 trial, no significant differences were observed between the intervention
and control groups in stress (3.0 vs 2.9, respectively; p = 0.61), mealtime duration (15.6 min vs
15.3 min; p = 0.82), or fatigue (2.9 vs 2.9; p = 0.95) (Table 2). In addition, no significant differ-
ences were apparent in the numbers of admissions (14.1 vs 14.0; p = 0.86) or transferred
patients (median, 11 vs 12; Wilcoxon p = 0.68).
No adverse effects were reported.
Sensitivity analysis
We conducted sensitivity analyses on the primary outcomes for each trial. There was no differ-
ence in any outcomes between the groups for each trial, and the point estimates of any out-
comes were similar to those in the primary analysis (Table 3).
Discussion
The results from our J(^o^)PAN randomized trials suggest that peppy comments from attend-
ing physicians have no effect on most resident-oriented outcomes. While the residents in the
intervention group examined more transferred patients than those in the control group, the
difference (0.5 patients) was clinically small. The total numbers of admissions and ED visits, as
well as the shift characteristics, were similar between both groups in either trial. Therefore,
peppy comments from attending physicians appear to have little to no clinical impact on the
workload of residents and the entire ED. Our findings do not support the existence of such a
jinx in the ED setting.
To our knowledge, medical superstitions have only been investigated in two randomized
trials [8, 9]. One of these trials included on-call house officers in the United States who were or
were not randomly assigned a jinx message stating “You will have a great call day”[8]. Com-
pared with the control group, the “jinxed” group experienced significantly fewer admissions,
got more hours of sleep, and reported a lower subjective level of difficulty regarding their
work. The other trial, which included on-call medical staffs in Singapore, did not find an asso-
ciation between the consumption of steamed buns (bao) by on-call staffs and increased admis-
sions or inpatient mortality[9]. Both trials were conducted in inpatient settings, and their

 results, similar to those in the present studies, suggested that superstitions had no jinxing
effect.
We were concerned that, if the message was repeatedly given to the participants, its novelty
and didactic intention might diminish over time, the participants might be suspicious of this
study conduct, or a sort of learning effect would occur. We did sensitivity analyses by eliminat-
ing the data except for the first 10 shifts, and the analyses produced results similar to the pri-
mary analysis (i,e. the results representing the whole study period). The lack of discrepancy
between the primary and sensitivity analyses might suggest that these changes in the partici-
pants did not occur during the study.
Murphy’s law reads: if something can go wrong, it will, with a probability in direct propor-
tion to the amount of trouble it will cause when it goes awry. There are variants for this law,
but all they express perverse outcomes and some superstitions in medicine are derived from
this law [10]. If this law did exist and one prayed for the silence in the ED, we had hypothesized
that the objective outcomes such as the number of patients visiting the ED and admitted
patients would increase. Meanwhile, on the assumption that the residents unconsciously
believed in this law, we had presumed that their perception of their workload, such as the busy-
ness and the difficulty of their shift, would be negatively affected by the suggestion of the mes-
sages, and be bad ones. Our results suggested that most of the objective and subjective
outcomes were similar between the groups. The lack of significant difference in most objective
outcomes between the groups suggested that this superstition had no or little, if any, influence
in the ED setting.
However, the lack of difference in any subjective outcomes or the residents’ perception was
surprising. One potential explanation of this finding was the existence of central tendency. The
mean values of all residents’ perception about the workload were around 3 on a 5-point Likert
scale. Central tendency is a famous phenomenon, especially seen in east Asian people, who
avoid clear or extreme opinions and prefer to offer ambiguous or "middle" opinions to avoid
adverse effects on intra-group harmony, or offence to the questioners or the attending physi-
cians in this case [11–13]. Given that the mean values of all residents’ subjective outcomes in
either group centrally distributed, it is reasonable that this resulted in the lack of difference in
these outcomes.
Strength and limitations
To the best of our knowledge, our studies were the first randomized trials conducted to exam-
ine whether cheery and supportive comments increased the workload of residents in the ED
setting. Among trials on medical superstitions, the sample sizes in our studies were the largest
to date. The strengths of our studies include the use of central randomization, the assessor-
blinded assessment of outcomes, and the fact that no participants were lost to follow-up. All
questionnaires were collected at the end of resident shifts, and there was only a small possibil-
ity of recall bias for the subjective outcomes.
However, this study did have limitations. First, we did not set the sample size for both trials.
Randomized trials of this kind have never been performed in the ED setting, which precluded
the sample size calculation. Meanwhile, our trials were considered as pilot studies with small
sample sizes, but were conducted for a long period, namely, nearly a year. Thus, we believe
that our study provided a pragmatic finding and trend. Second, the association between resi-
dents’ baseline level of superstition and their workload was unknown. Some residents perceive
themselves as “black clouds,” meaning that they tend to have more severe patients and busier
duties than others, who are referred to as “white clouds” [14, 15]. However, questioning the
baseline level of superstition would have inevitably biased the answers about residents’

 subjective workloads. Furthermore, our trials included a large number of residents, and there-
fore a small number of randomizations for each resident. These precluded the subgroup analy-
sis regarding whether “black clouds” were destined to face busier duties than “white clouds.”
Despite these limitations, our study designs were pragmatic and similar to our usual practice,
and therefore, our findings are considered highly generalizable to our practice. Our results
could be helpful in promoting a more congenial and thus less stressful working environment
for both attending physicians and residents.
Conclusion
The results from our two J(^o^)PAN trials suggest that peppy comments from attending phy-
sicians have minimal to no jinxing effect on the workload of residents working in the ED, or
on the entire ED itself. In other words, residents and attending physicians should not be afraid
of triggering a jinx when uttering peppy comments such as "Hope you have a quiet day!"
Attending physicians should feel free to offer peppy comments to residents if they so choose.
Residents should feel confident in accepting such remarks without fear of being jinxed.
