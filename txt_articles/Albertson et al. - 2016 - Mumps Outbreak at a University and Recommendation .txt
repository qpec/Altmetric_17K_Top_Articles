Mumps is an acute viral disease characterized by fever and 
swelling of the parotid or other salivary glands. On May 1, 
2015, the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) 
confirmed a mumps outbreak at the University of Illinois 
at Urbana-Champaign. IDPH and the Champaign-Urbana 
Public Health District (C-UPHD) conducted an investigation 
and identified 317 cases of mumps during April 2015–May 
2016. Because of sustained transmission in a population with 
high 2-dose coverage with measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) 
vaccine, a third MMR dose was recommended by IDPH, 
C-UPHD, and the university’s McKinley Health Center. 
No formal recommendation for or against the use of a third 
MMR dose has been issued by the Advisory Committee on 
Immunization Practices (ACIP) (1). However, CDC has pro-
vided guidelines for use of a third dose as a control measure 
during mumps outbreaks in settings in which persons are in 
close contact with one another, where transmission is sustained 
despite high 2-dose MMR coverage, and when traditional 
control measures fail to slow transmission (2).
On April 15, 2015, the university health center reported to 
C-UPHD a male aged 21 years with fever and parotitis begin-
ning April 9. Mumps was suspected; however, confirmatory 
testing was not performed. During the following 2 weeks, five 
additional suspected cases of mumps were identified. Each 
patient received a diagnosis of parotitis without laboratory 
confirmation of mumps. All patients with suspected mumps 
had documentation of receipt of 2 doses of MMR vaccine. On 
May 1, 2015, a seventh suspected mumps case was confirmed 
by a positive real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain 
reaction (rRT-PCR) test of a buccal swab conducted at the 
IDPH state laboratory. The six previous suspected cases were 
epidemiologically linked to the same academic program as the 
confirmed case, which enabled IDPH to establish the existence 
of a mumps outbreak at the university.
Confirmed, probable, and suspected cases were identified 
using the standard case definition for mumps (3). Patients 
were considered to be infectious from 2 days before until 
5 days after the onset of parotitis. The exposure period was 
defined as 12–25 days before the onset of parotitis. Outbreak 
control measures recommended to the university health center 
by C-UPHD included standard and droplet precautions for 
patients in health care facilities and isolation of ill patients. 
Ill students were directed to return home or were provided 
alternative housing during their infectious period. Investigators 
identified contacts of mumps patients to verify receipt of 
2 doses of MMR vaccine and recommended vaccination of 
susceptible close contacts if they were not fully vaccinated.* 
Susceptible close contacts who had a contraindication to vac-
cination or who refused vaccination were excluded from public 
settings for 14 days (from days 12–25 following exposure to 
a person with probable or confirmed mumps). University 
vaccination records were reviewed, and 2-dose MMR vac-
cination coverage was estimated at >97% among all students. 
On May 26, 2015, IDPH posted a notification on CDC’s 
Epidemic Information Exchange (Epi-X) and issued a memo-
randum to health departments to request information on cases 
among persons who returned home from the university during 
the summer semester.
Despite high 2-dose MMR coverage and a reduced student 
population on campus, cases continued to occur during the 
summer semester (Figure). By July 31, a total of 70 cases had 
been reported. On August 4, IDPH, C-UPHD, and the uni-
versity health center issued a recommendation for all students 
and staff members born during or after 1957† to receive an 
additional dose of MMR vaccine (2). Notifications were sent 
to students and their families, and an Epi-X notification was 
posted to inform state health agencies of the recommendation. 
An estimated 50,000 students and staff members were targeted 
for this intervention.
A total of 8,200 doses of MMR vaccine were administered 
at five vaccination clinics held on the university campus dur-
ing August 6–27. An unknown number of additional vaccine 
doses were administered to students and staff members liv-
ing off-campus during the summer, who were encouraged 
to received vaccine from a health care provider or pharmacy 
before returning to school. C-UPHD and the university health 
center administered an additional 3,300 doses throughout the 
* Susceptible persons include all persons without evidence of immunity to mumps. 
Evidence of immunity includes 1) laboratory evidence of immunity to mumps; 
2) documentation of receipt of 2 doses of MMR vaccine for school-aged children 
and adults at high risk (e.g., health care personnel, international travelers, or 
students at postsecondary educational institutions); 3) documentation of at 
least 1 dose of MMR vaccine for preschool-aged children and adults not at high 
risk; 4) birth before 1957; or 5) documentation of physician-diagnosed mumps.
† Because of widespread transmission of the mumps virus before the mumps 
vaccine was recommended for routine use, persons born before 1957 are likely 
to have been infected naturally and are presumed to be immune.

FIGURE. Number of confirmed and probable cases of mumps (N = 317) on the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus, by month

fall and spring semesters. Persons vaccinated were monitored 
for 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine and were given a 
vaccine information statement. No serious vaccine-related 
adverse events were reported.
Investigators identified 317 probable and confirmed mumps 
cases with onset during April 9, 2015–May 27, 2016. One 
hundred (32%) cases were laboratory confirmed by rRT-PCR, 
and 217 (68%) were classified as probable. Cases occurred in 
persons who ranged in age from 16–55 years, with a median 
age of 20 years. Twenty-two (7%) patients were evaluated at 
the emergency department, and three (1%) were hospitalized 
(one to treat meningitis, one to rule out meningitis, and one 
for parotitis pain management). Two (1%) patients experienced 
orchitis, a recognized complication of mumps (2). No deaths 
were reported. Specimens from four cases were genotyped at the 
CDC Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Herpesvirus Laboratory 
Branch; all were mumps genotype G. All cases were epidemio-
logically linked to the university; 278 (88%) cases occurred 
in students, three (1%) in staff members, and 36 (11%) in 
persons not affiliated with the university, but who had contact 
with university students or the campus. Several sub-clusters 
occurred within the larger outbreak in certain academic pro-
grams, athletic facilities, and community workplaces.
Among the 317 cases identified, at the time of parotitis 
onset, 50 (16%) mumps patients had received 3 doses of 
MMR vaccine, 232 (73%) had received 2 doses, 12 (4%) had 
received 1 dose, seven (2%) were unvaccinated, and 16 (5%) 
had unknown vaccination status. Forty-five (90%) of the 
50 patients with a third dose received it during this outbreak, 
and five (10%) received it in prior years for reasons unrelated 
to this outbreak. Some of the 45 persons who received a third 
dose during this outbreak might have been exposed before 
vaccine-induced immunity was boosted. Eleven (24%) of 
the 45 patients had parotitis onset on the same day or within 
2 weeks after receiving the third dose, six (13%) within 
2–4 weeks, and 27 (60%) >4 weeks after. One (2%) patient 
received a third dose 3 days after parotitis onset.
Discussion
As in many previously described mumps outbreaks, this 
outbreak was characterized by sustained transmission, despite 
high 2-dose MMR vaccination coverage (4–7). Two doses of 
MMR vaccine are currently routinely recommended for the 
prevention of mumps; the first for children at 12–15 months 
of age and the second for children at 4–6 years of age (2). The 
median vaccine effectiveness against mumps has been estimated 
at 78% for 1 dose and 88% for 2 doses (2). However, 2-dose 
vaccine failure and possible waning of vaccine-induced immu-
nity have been described in recent outbreaks, particularly in 
high-density, close-contact settings (4–8). Because outbreaks 
occur despite high 2-dose coverage, a third dose has been 
provided as a control measure to targeted populations during 
previous outbreaks (4,5,7). 
No formal recommendation for a third MMR dose exists, but 
CDC has provided guidelines for public health agencies consid-
ering its use as a control measure during mumps outbreaks (2).

Factors that might trigger a recommendation include outbreaks 
among populations with 2-dose MMR vaccination coverage of 
>90%, intense exposure settings such as universities, evidence 
of sustained transmission for >2 weeks, and high attack rates 
(>5 cases per 1,000 population). Evidence of sustained disease 
transmission despite high 2-dose vaccination coverage among 
university students supported the decision to recommend a 
third MMR dose during this outbreak. The fourth criterion 
of high attack rates was not considered; because transmission 
occurred during spring, summer, and fall semesters when stu-
dent enrollment varied widely, it was not possible to calculate 
an accurate attack rate because of frequent, large changes in 
the denominator.
In addition to meeting criteria in the CDC guidelines, two 
important aspects of this outbreak supported the recommen-
dation for a third dose of MMR vaccine. First, this outbreak 
did not follow typical seasonal trends for mumps in Illinois, 
where incidence normally peaks during late winter and spring 
(Illinois Department of Public Health, unpublished data, 
2016); evidence of sustained transmission extending into the 
summer months was concerning. During 2005–2014, the 
median number of mumps cases each year during June and July 
in Illinois was six statewide; in this outbreak, 53 cases occurred 
during these 2 months. This deviation from the 10-year median 
and continued transmission during the summer months was 
unexpected because of the reduction of high-density, close-
contact settings on campus. Student enrollment declined from 
41,497 in the 2015 spring semester to 11,684 in the summer, 
a reduction of 72%.
The second aspect that supported the recommendation was 
the anticipation of a large number of students returning for 
the 2015 fall semester, which would increase the population 
density on campus and provide opportunities for exposure. 
Many students would be returning to high-density congregate 
settings such as university housing, and large social events 
often occur early during the semester. An unknown number 
of susceptible persons would also be added to the population; 
although documentation of mumps vaccination (or other evi-
dence of mumps immunity) is required by the university, the 
requirement is not enforced until students attempt to register 
for the subsequent semester.
The effectiveness of a third dose of MMR vaccine has not 
been established, but rationale exists for its use in outbreak 
settings. There is some evidence that a third dose induces an 
immune response, and in two outbreaks, attack rates declined 
after a third dose intervention (4,5,9,10). However, the decline 
in attack rate was not statistically significant in one outbreak; in 
both outbreaks, the intervention was given after the outbreaks 
had peaked, and other outbreaks occurring among similar 
populations showed declining attack rates without admin-
istration of a third dose of MMR vaccine (8). In addition, 
recommending an intervention that has limited evidence of 
effectiveness might result in unnecessary costs and introduce 
the potential for vaccine-related adverse events. Currently 
there is no formal recommendation for a third dose of MMR 
vaccine during mumps outbreaks; the decision to implement 
this intervention needs to be carefully considered. In light of 
the recent increased incidence of mumps, CDC is gathering 
additional data to assess use of a third dose of vaccine to inform 
decision-making during outbreak responses and potential 
changes in the recommendations.
Although evidence of its effectiveness is needed, a third dose 
of MMR vaccine may be considered as a control measure during 
mumps outbreaks occurring in settings in which persons are in 
close contact with one another, when transmission is sustained 
despite high 2-dose MMR coverage, and when traditional con-
trol measures fail to slow transmission. The final case in this 
outbreak occurred in May 2016, and the outbreak was declared 
over in July. Although transmission continued until May 2016, 
there was a decline in cases in the months immediately following 
August 2015, when the recommendation was made. Further 
evaluation is needed to determine if the reduction was a result 
of the recommendation for a third MMR dose.
Summary
What is already known on this topic?
Mumps outbreaks can occur in close-contact settings like 
universities, despite high 2-dose MMR vaccination coverage.  
A third dose of MMR vaccine has been used in previous mumps 
outbreaks, but its effectiveness is not established.
What is added by this report?
A large outbreak of mumps occurred at the University of Illinois at 
Urbana-Champaign during April 2015–May 2016; 89% of patients 
with mumps had received at least 2 doses of measles-mumps-
rubella (MMR) vaccine, and a third dose was recommended as a 
control measure. The rationale for the recommendation of a third 
MMR dose included a consideration of seasonal trends and 
characteristics of the at-risk population. These were weighed 
against potential drawbacks, which included the potential for 
vaccine-related side effects, associated costs, and the lack of 
evidence of the effectiveness of a third MMR dose.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Both CDC guidelines and factors unique to the outbreak should 
be carefully considered by public health agencies before issuing 
a similar recommendation. Additional studies are needed to 
determine the effectiveness of a third MMR dose as a mumps 
outbreak control measure in certain populations.
