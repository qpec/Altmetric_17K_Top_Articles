ABSTRACT
Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a major public health threat world-
wide. The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is associated with
enhanced susceptibility to and severity of CDI; however, the mechanisms driving this
phenomenon have not been elucidated. NSAIDs alter prostaglandin (PG) metabolism
by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. Here, we found that treatment with
the NSAID indomethacin prior to infection altered the microbiota and dramatically
increased mortality and the intestinal pathology associated with CDI in mice. We
demonstrated that in C. difficile-infected animals, indomethacin treatment led to PG
deregulation, an altered proinflammatory transcriptional and protein profile, and
perturbed epithelial cell junctions. These effects were paralleled by increased recruit-
ment of intestinal neutrophils and CD4� cells and also by a perturbation of the gut
microbiota. Together, these data implicate NSAIDs in the disruption of protective
COX-mediated PG production during CDI, resulting in altered epithelial integrity and
associated immune responses.
IMPORTANCE Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a spore-forming anaerobic bacte-
rium and leading cause of antibiotic-associated colitis. Epidemiological data suggest
that use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) increases the risk for CDI
in humans, a potentially important observation given the widespread use of NSAIDs.
Prior studies in rodent models of CDI found that NSAID exposure following infection
increases the severity of CDI, but mechanisms to explain this are lacking. Here we
present new data from a mouse model of antibiotic-associated CDI suggesting that
brief NSAID exposure prior to CDI increases the severity of the infectious colitis.
These data shed new light on potential mechanisms linking NSAID use to worsened
CDI, including drug-induced disturbances to the gut microbiome and colonic epithe-
lial integrity. Studies were limited to a single NSAID (indomethacin), so future stud-
ies are needed to assess the generalizability of our findings and to establish a direct
link to the human condition.

 to toxic megacolon and/or death, particularly in older adults (2). The primary risk factor
for CDI is antibiotic treatment, which perturbs the resident gut microbiota and abol-
ishes colonization resistance (3). However, factors other than antibiotic exposure in-
crease the risk for CDI and the incidence of cases not associated with the use of
antimicrobials has been on the rise (4). Defining mechanisms whereby nonantibiotic
factors impact CDI pathogenesis promises to reveal actionable targets for preventing or
treating this infection.
Recently, several previously unappreciated immune system, host, microbiota, and
dietary factors have emerged as modulators of CDI severity and risk. The food additive
trehalose, for example, was recently shown to increase C. difficile virulence in mice, and
the widespread adoption of trehalose in food products was implicated in the emer-
gence of hypervirulent strains of C. difficile (5). Similarly, excess dietary zinc had a
profound impact on severity of C. difficile disease in mice, and high levels of zinc altered
the gut microbiota and increased susceptibility to CDI (6). Importantly, there is a
growing body of evidence of the essential role of the innate immune response and
inflammation in both protection against and pathology of CDI (7–9). Mounting a proper
and robust inflammatory response is critical for successful clearance of C. difficile, and
the immune response can be a key predictor of prognosis (3, 10). In this context,
specific immune mediators can facilitate both protective and pathogenic responses
through the activity of molecules such as interleukin-23 (IL-23) and IL-22, and an
excessive and dysregulated immune response is believed to be one of the main factors
behind postinfection complications.
Epidemiological data have established an association between the use of nonsteroi-
dal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and CDI (11). Muñoz-Miralles and colleagues
demonstrated that the NSAID indomethacin (Indo) significantly increased the severity
of CDI in antibiotic-treated mice when the NSAID was applied following inoculation and
throughout the infection (12), and indomethacin exposure is associated with alterations
in the structure of the intestinal microbiota (13, 14). NSAIDs are among the most highly
prescribed and most widely consumed drugs in the United States (15), particularly
among older adults (16), and have been implicated in causing spontaneous colitis in
humans (17, 18). They act by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymatic activity, which
prevents the generation of prostaglandins (PGs) and alters the outcome of subsequent
inflammatory events. Prostaglandins, especially PGE2, are important lipid mediators
that are highly abundant at sites of inflammation and infection and that support
gastrointestinal homeostasis and epithelial cell (EC) health (19). NSAID use has been
associated with shifts in the gut microbiota, in both rodents and humans (20–23), but
these shifts have not been explored in the context of CDI.
In this report, we deployed a mouse model of antibiotic-associated CDI to examine
the impact of exposure to indomethacin prior to infection with C. difficile on disease
severity, immune response, intestinal epithelial integrity, and the gut microbiota. These
investigations revealed that even a brief exposure to an NSAID prior to C. difficile
inoculation dramatically increased CDI severity, reduced survival, and increased path-
ological evidence of disease. Inhibition of PG biosynthesis by indomethacin altered the
cytokine response and immune cell recruitment following CDI, enhancing intestinal
tissue histopathology and allowing partial systemic bacterial dissemination by disman-
tling intestinal epithelial tight junctions (TJs). Additionally, indomethacin treatment
alone significantly perturbed the structure of the gut microbiota. These findings
support epidemiological data linking NSAID use and CDI and caution against the
overuse of NSAIDs in patients at high risk for C. difficile, such as older adults.
RESULTS
Indomethacin worsens C. difficile Infection in Mice and Increases Mortality. To
determine the extent to which preexposure to NSAIDs influences the natural course of
CDI, mice were treated with indomethacin for 2 days prior to inoculation with C. difficile
(Fig. 1A). We infected C57BL/6 female mice with 1 � 104 spores of C. difficile NAP1/BI/
027 strain M7404 following 5 days of pretreatment with a broad-spectrum antibiotic,

 cecal tissue damage compared to mice infected with C. difficile that were not exposed
to the drug (Fig. 1E). Indomethacin-exposed and infected mice exhibited no change in
the burden of C. difficile in the cecum (Fig. 1F), but their livers harbored significantly
greater loads of mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria (Fig. 1G), suggesting that
indomethacin pretreatment compromised intestinal barrier function during CDI and
fostered microbiota translocation to the liver.
Indomethacin alters the proportions of neutrophils and CD4� T cells in
mucosal-associated tissues during C. difficile infection. The mucosal immune re-
sponse is an important factor in the clearance of and the pathology associated with CDI
(10, 24–27). NSAIDs can disturb immune homeostasis within the gastrointestinal mu-
cosa (28) and have been used to trigger immune-mediated colitis in mice(29). We
determined the extent to which indomethacin altered immune cell populations in and
around the gastrointestinal tract during CDI. Mice were euthanized by day 3 after
infection, and cells from the peritoneal cavity, mesenteric lymph nodes (mLN), and
colonic lamina propria (cLP) were processed for flow cytometry analysis. CDI provoked
an increase of neutrophil and CD4� T cell numbers across all three compartments
(Fig. 2). Focusing on the differences caused by indomethacin exposure prior to CDI, we
found that neutrophils levels were significantly increased in the peritoneal cavity
compared to those seen with CDI alone. This was paralleled by a similar overall trend
in the mLN and colonic lamina propria (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, numbers CD4� T
cells were slightly decreased in the mLN but were increased in the cLP (Fig. 2C), possibly
due to selective migration and/or proliferation in inflamed sites. Considering that IL-17
has been implicated in driving the neutrophilic inflammatory response to CDI (88) and
that Th17 cells and innate lymphoid cells, type 3 (ILC3), are major sources of IL-17
during inflammatory responses, we evaluated the combined effects of indomethacin
and CDI on these populations. Interestingly, higher numbers of CD4� ROR�t� (Th17)
cells were found in the cLP but not in the mLN (Fig. 2D). CDI also induced a modest
expansion of ILC3 cell numbers in the cLP, but there were no significant alterations due
to indomethacin pretreatment (Fig. 2E). These data demonstrate that indomethacin
pretreatment exacerbates neutrophilic and Th17-type immune responses in the intes-
tinal milieu to CDI in the mouse.
Indomethacin dysregulates the expression of genes involved in prostaglandin
metabolism and inflammatory peptides during CDI. CDI induces extensive transcrip-
tional changes in the intestines that generally result in protective responses that
restrain bacterial spread and mitigate induced intestinal epithelial pathology (3, 30). To
examine the impact of indomethacin on this response, we interrogated transcriptional
changes related to inflammatory responses in the cecum following indomethacin
pretreatment followed by CDI using a panel of inflammatory markers (NanoString
nCounter) that encompassed 254 transcripts. After curating the processed raw data to
remove false positives/negatives, to normalize the data, and to filter for internal
coherence with 6 housekeeping genes, we obtained mRNA values for 168 genes and
generated a list of genes significantly altered upon exposure to each treatment
compared to the antibiotic-treatment-alone group. We noted significant alterations,
both positive and negative, in the inflammatory gene transcriptome of the cecum in
mice infected with C. difficile following brief indomethacin exposure compared with C.
difficile-inoculated mice that were not treated with the NSAID (Fig. 3B to D). Notably,
indomethacin pretreatment followed by CDI significantly upregulated several genes
involved in innate immune cell activation and recruitment such as Il1b, Cxcl3, Csf3, and
Cxcl1 and downregulated Cd4, Tlr5, and Tgfb2 (Fig. 3C and D).
To further characterize the impact of NSAIDs on the immune response during CDI,
we explored the impact of indomethacin on intrinsic mechanisms of host defense in
the gastrointestinal tract. Specifically, we focused on the Gram-positive selective anti-
microbial peptide REG3� and on mucin, two host intestinal defense factors that have
been shown to be important for the control of gastrointestinal infections (31). We
confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) that CDI upregulated
Reg3g transcription whereas Muc2 transcript levels were not significantly altered fol-

 lowing indomethacin treatment (Fig. 3E). To evaluate if PGE2 synthesis and signaling
were altered due to infection or indomethacin treatment, we analyzed the expression
of genes encoding PGE2 receptors and the enzymes involved in PGE2 metabolism. The
transcription of PGE2 receptor gene Ptger4 was severely suppressed upon CDI, but
indomethacin did not significantly exacerbate the suppression (Fig. 3F). Infection with
C. difficile suppressed colonic expression of the Ptgs1 and Ptgs2 genes, encoding COX-1
and COX-2, respectively (Fig. 3G). Notably, indomethacin pretreatment prevented
this downmodulation and simultaneously induced the expression of the Ptges gene,
which encodes an inducible synthase for PGE2 (Fig. 3G). What is more, indomethacin
further reduced expression of the gene encoding PGE2-inactivating enzyme 15-
hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (Hpgd gene; Fig. 3G). This selective inhibition of
Ptgs2 transcription, together with inhibition of Hpgd and enhancement of Ptges, is
consistent with the paradoxical increase in PGE2 concentrations that we observed at 72
h after infection in the supernatant of colon explants from mice treated in the same
manner (Fig. 3H). Together, these data demonstrate that indomethacin pretreatment
increases innate immune cell activation and recruitment while also leading to PG
dysregulation.
Indomethacin increases intestinal inflammation by upregulating a combina-
tion of myeloid cell recruitment and response in the cecum. Following the obser-
vation that indomethacin pretreatment significantly altered cellular and transcriptional
immune responses during CDI, we sought to determine the impact of this drug on
tissue-level inflammatory protein expression during infection. Infected mice (exposed
or not exposed to indomethacin) were euthanized, and ceca were harvested at day 3
post-CDI. Whole-tissue homogenates were used to measure the concentration of a
panel of inflammation-related proteins and were normalized to total protein content
per cecum (Fig. 4). The protein levels observed largely supported the transcriptomics
results from our previous studies, confirming what has already been reported for CDI
regarding IL-1� and immune mononuclear cell recruitment and activation proteins
such as CCL3, CXCL2, and CCL4. Interestingly, class IL-6 cytokines (IL-6, leukemia
inhibitory factor [LIF]) were among those whose numbers were most enhanced by
indomethacin pretreatment, consistent with what has been found in humans infected
with C. difficile (25, 32, 33). Together with the increase in IL-1�, and consistent with the
results reported above showing enhanced Th17 responses, these data imply that an
exacerbated IL-17A-related response caused by indomethacin had occurred. In con-
trast, some type-1-associated inflammatory molecules such as IL-12p40 were down-
regulated by indomethacin pretreatment.
Indomethacin perturbs colonic epithelial cell junctions of C. difficile-infected
mice. The observations of the increased bacterial translocation (Fig. 1G), together with
the increased local PGE2 levels (Fig. 3H) and enhancement of numbers of inflammatory
molecules (Fig. 4), led us to investigate whether the integrity of the intestinal epithelial
barrier was compromised due to indomethacin pretreatment during CDI. We assessed
the impact of indomethacin on the integrity of colonic epithelial junctions of C.
difficile-infected mice via transmission electron microscopy and immunofluorescence
staining of tight junction (TJ) proteins and TJ-associated proteins. Intestinal epithelial
cells (IECs) of uninfected mice, cefoperazone-treated and uninfected mice, and
cefoperazone-and-indomethacin-pretreated mice had uniform microvilli and intact cell

 (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Collectively, our data suggest that indo-
methacin acts synergistically with C. difficile to alter the localization of occludin and ZO1
and to perturb the TJ integrity of intestinal epithelial cells in vivo.
Indomethacin alters the intestinal microbiota composition without further
reducing microbial community diversity after antibiotic treatment. The composi-
tion of the gut microbiota has a profound impact on the manifestation and clearance
of CDI, as well as on the virulence of C. difficile and on the outcome of disease (34, 35).
There is also evidence suggesting prominent off-target effects of pharmaceutical
agents, such as NSAIDs, on the gut microbiota and on gastrointestinal health (21, 36).
To examine the impact of indomethacin on the murine gut microbiota, mice were
treated with a 2-day course of indomethacin and the microbial community was
subsequently surveyed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. At 1 day posttreatment, mice
given indomethacin showed no significant alteration in �-diversity (Fig. S2) but exhib-
ited a significant shift in community structure compared to untreated mice (P � 0.001

observed a significant decrease in OTUs affiliated with the Turicibacter (OTU 18) genus
and Porphyromonadaceae (OTU 5) family following indomethacin treatment (Fig. 6B
and C). To examine the longitudinal impact of indomethacin on the murine gut

2 days following administration of indomethacin treatment, and a significant enrich-
ment of Bacteroides (OTU 1) could be detected as much as 11 days following treatment
with indomethacin (Fig. 6C). Next, to determine how indomethacin may impact the
microbiota in the context of antibiotic treatment, mice were again exposed to indo-
methacin for 2 days following 5 days of cefoperazone (0.5 mg/ml) treatment. Although
cefoperazone treatment dramatically reduced the overall level of community
�-diversity in all mice, we detected significant alterations in community structure
associated with cotreatment with indomethacin and cefoperazone that could be
observed at 11 days posttreatment (Fig. 6D; see also Fig. S3). Initial differences in
microbial community structure were driven by a significant bloom in Paenibacillus (OTU

methacin and cefoperazone on day 11 posttreatment (Fig. 6E and F). Together, these
data suggest that indomethacin has a marked effect on the structure of the gut
microbiota and that these off-target effects likely contribute to disease exacerbation
during CDI.
DISCUSSION
CDI is the most commonly diagnosed cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and
has surpassed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as the most common health
care associated infection in many U.S. hospitals (37). Nearly 30,000 people die each year
in the United States from CDI (38). A major challenge of CDI is recurrence, which can
impact 20% to 30% of patients and is associated with an increased risk of death (4, 39).
One of the most promising treatments for CDI is fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT),
which is estimated to be �80% effective in most studies (40, 41). However, problems
with standardization and availability and putative risks from FMT have made this form
of therapy suboptimal (42). There continues to be a demand for effective approaches
to limit CDI severity and to understand complications arising from the synergy of CDI
with intestinal immune responses and with the drugs used to limit damaging inflam-
matory effects.
The NSAIDs are among the most commonly prescribed drugs in the United States,
with more than 98 million prescriptions filled annually (15), and an estimated 29 million
Americans use over-the-counter NSAIDs per year (43). As they prevent synthesis of
endogenous PGs, NSAIDs can adversely affect intestinal health. Results from epidemi-
ological studies, underscored by a recent meta-analysis (11), have revealed an associ-
ation between CDI risk and the use of NSAIDs. The plausibility of a link between NSAID
use and CDI is bolstered by the association between NSAID use and flare-ups of
inflammatory bowel disease and the occasional occurrence of NSAID-induced colitis
(44–47). Recent mouse studies have established that concomitant NSAID use exacer-
bates active CDI (12).
Animal and human studies suggest that CDI induces local and systemic increases in
PGs, including PGE2 (48). Prostaglandin E2 is one of the most common and best-
characterized PGs and has long been known to have major effects on gastrointestinal
health (49–52). COX-1-dependent production of PGE2 is gastroprotective, explaining
why chronic NSAID use is associated with stomach ulcers and why such ulcers can be
prevented by administering the FDA-approved oral PGE analogue misoprostol to
NSAID-treated patients (53). In addition, endogenous PGE2 production prevents gut
epithelial cell death and promotes colonic tumor growth by directly inducing tumor
epithelial cell proliferation, survival, and migration invasion (53–55). It is also possible
that PGE2 modulates disease through alteration of the microbiome, as NSAIDs have

 been implicated as potentially disrupting the gut microbiome (21, 56). Additionally,
PGE2 functions as a key inflammatory signal that can regulate certain immune re-
sponses, with its local levels being tightly regulated during the trigger of but also the
resolution of inflammatory processes (57–59). Some of the best-known functions of
PGE2 are indeed its role in intestinal inflammation and cancer and its impact on the
immune system (19). Paradoxically, we observed that pretreatment with the COX
inhibitor indomethacin caused a dysregulation of PG metabolism that led to increased
PGE2 production upon CDI. This heightened PGE2 production might represent a
“rebound” effect following temporary exposure to indomethacin prior to infection,
since continued indomethacin dosing throughout infection was recently shown to
suppress PGE2 production (12). This exaggerated PGE2 response was associated with
elevated levels of intestinal inflammatory cytokines, monocyte and neutrophil recruit-
ment, partial dismantling of the intestinal epithelial cell’
s tight junctions, and a specific
disturbed microbiota composition. Interestingly, this is highly consistent with several
studies that reported a protective role for PGE2 in inducing an orchestrated tolerance
response that involves innate immune cells such as ILC3 cells, neutrophils, and mac-
rophages (58, 60, 61).
Immune protection against C. difficile challenge seems function independently of
the presence of CD4� cells, anti-toxin IgG, and pIgR (62), but it strongly relies on rapid
and effective myeloid cell responses (9, 38, 63). Cells of the immune system can exert
critical roles in controlling bacterial pathogen damage and intestinal health through
production of damaging or protective cytokines by T cells or innate lymphoid cells
(ILCs) (64, 65). Production of gamma interferon (IFN-�) by T cells and neutrophils has a
role in protection against CDI (66, 67), and the associated production of IL-12 by innate
cells upon CDI can have a strong positive-feedback effect on IFN-� production in this
context. The role of IL-17 cytokines and of their cellular sources is more controversial,
as they can induce damage but can also trigger intestinal repair processes and maintain
barrier integrity (68, 69). Perturbation of the microbiota induced by antibiotic treatment
can also cause an imbalance of protective Treg/Th17 ratios (70). ILCs are, however,
critical for controlling the acute response induced by CDI. In contrast to Rag1�/� mice,
Rag2�/� Il2r��/� mice rapidly succumb to CDI. While ILC3 cells display a limited role
in resistance, loss of IFN-�-expressing ILC1s in Rag1�/� mice increased susceptibility (7).
The contribution to CDI pathogenesis by other highly relevant cytokines such as IL-23
and IL-22 provided by innate immune cells strongly depends on context (24, 25, 38,
71–73). In our studies, we found that indomethacin pretreatment prior to CDI increased
local levels of chemokines that induce recruitment of inflammatory myeloid cells such
as CXC2, CCL3, and CCL4, with a concomitant increase in numbers of circulating and
local neutrophils, while type 3 ILC numbers were unaltered. Also, in coordination with
the increased levels of intestinal IL-6 and IL-1�, higher total numbers of CD4� cells and
CD4� ROR�t� cells were found in the colonic lamina propria but not the draining
mesenteric lymph nodes.
Intestinal epithelial cells constitute the main barrier against infectious agents colo-
nizing the gastrointestinal tract. Cell junctional complexes, notably, the tight junctions,
regulate paracellular permeability and restrict the translocation of luminal microbes
and microbial products across the epithelial monolayer (74). Displacement of occludin,
but not ZO-1, from the junctions of mouse colonic epithelial cells during CDI did not
manifest as gross morphological changes of TJ regions during EM visualization. This is
reminiscent of the alterations seen in anti-CD3-treated mice or tumor necrosis factor
alpha (TNF-�)-treated mice and is consistent with the view that occludin is a regulator,
rather than a key structural component, of TJs (75). However, indomethacin pretreat-
ment with CDI redistributed both occludin and ZO-1 to the cytosol, and electron
micrographs revealed a concomitant loss of TJ interactions. These changes are ex-
pected to increase paracellular permeability and promote bacterial translocation and
could explain the observed increase in bacterial burden in the livers of indomethacin-
treated, C. difficile-infected animals.

 caused by antibiotic administration that lead to dismantling of colonization resistance
(5, 34, 38, 76, 77). Interestingly, recent studies have begun to highlight previously
underappreciated and potentially detrimental effects of pharmaceutical drugs, such as
NSAIDs, on the gut microbiota (21, 36). We observed that indomethacin did not cause
an alteration of the microbial �-diversity but did induce significant alterations in
microbiota structure that lead to an enrichment of Bacteroides, Akkermansia, Porphy-
romonadaceae, and Parasutterella populations and to a decrease in Turicibacter and
Porphyromonadaceae populations. Interestingly, increases in Bacteroides and Akkerman-
sia populations have been reported to have occurred in association with inflammatory
bowel disease and other infections (78–81). Furthermore, Turicibacter has been shown
in several studies to be associated with colonization resistance to C. difficile (6, 82). Thus,
indomethacin-mediated alterations in the microbiota may have a profound impact on
the manifestation and severity of CDI. Interestingly, when the microbiota �-diversity
was severely reduced by antibiotic treatment, we found that Paenibacillus and Akker-
mansia populations expanded in mice pretreated with indomethacin. The role of
Paenibacillus in the pathology of CDI is unknown at present, and further investigation
is warranted.
Injury to intestinal epithelial barriers and microbial translocation can lead to a
systemic response that mimics some aspects of sepsis and unveils a massive release of
inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1�, that increases neutrophil and macrophage
recruitment and activation (25). It is still unclear how the innate and adaptive arms of
the immune response coordinate during CDI, especially in situations such as the one we
present with pretreatment with indomethacin. In such circumstances, it is important
that type 3 ILCs can dysregulate adaptive immune CD4� cell responses against
commensal bacteria but that this ILC-mediated regulation of adaptive immune cells
occurs independently of IL-17A, IL-22, or IL-23 but is dependent on antigen presenta-
tion (83). Additionally, administration of antibiotics alone can promote inflammation
through goblet cell-mediated translocation of native colonic microbiota in mice (84),
but CDI induces significant goblet cell loss (85), which would have a countering effect
on bacterial translocation under experimental conditions such as those described in
this work.
Our results highlight the capacity of a short-term oral dose of the NSAID indometh-
acin to cause an imbalance in PG production and to disrupt the intestinal barrier to
allow bacterial entrance in the bloodstream. These effects are paralleled by a specific
disarrangement of the intestinal microbiota and by dysregulated inflammatory and
immune responses that lead to increase pathological damage and finally unfold in an
increased mortality rate. Our results call for caution in the use of NSAIDs in the context
of C. difficile infections but also potentially when other intestinal pathogens or insults
co-occur with acute inflammatory events that affect PG balances. Moreover, we also
highlight how a temporary modification of a set of key inflammatory mediators such as
PGs in the host can lead to significant perturbations to the resident gut microbiota. We
believe that this unique combination of effects caused by indomethacin and CDI in the
host and their microbiota could represent a generalized mechanism that leads to
increased intestinal damage and complications when NSAIDs, or other drugs that alter
key inflammatory molecules with pleiotropic effects, are used. Given the common
application of NSAIDs to treat diverse inflammatory conditions, together with the
disturbances in microbiota diversity and the rates of increased incidence of CDI in
developed countries, the results of these studies warrant future follow-up studies in
humans.

mRNA isolation, expression analysis and qRT-PCR. After bulk RNA was isolated from tissues with
TRIzol (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer’
s instructions, a Qiagen RNeasy Plus minikit was
used to further purify mRNA for downstream analysis. mRNA expression was evaluated either by the use
of nSolver inflammation panel mouse v2 from NanoString (https://www.nanostring.com/application/
files/9414/9556/0025/LBL-10402-01_nCounter_Mouse_Inflammation_V2_Panel_Gene_List.xlsx)
directly
on mRNA samples or by qRT-PCR performed using an Applied Biosystems TaqMan amplification system
after cDNA generation using a SuperScript VILO cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Data generated by
NanoString technologies for mRNA quantification (the full gene list is available at https://www
.nanostring.com/download_file/view/409/3778) were analyzed after generating raw counts that were
produced using R version 3.3.2 (https://www.R-project.org/) for Fig. 3A to D. The count data produced by
the n-Counter Digital Analyzer for each of the two experiments were normalized using positive controls
(geometric mean method) and housekeeping genes (geometric mean method). The two sets of data
were then normalized together to be combined and analyzed together. After exclusion of one Indo-
plus-CDI sample (because that mouse was confirmed not to have been infected with CDI by cecal
content culture), the final normalized data set included 11 control samples and 11 Indo-treated, 12
CDI-treated, and 11 CDI-plus-Indo-treated samples. A gene was included in the analyses if its counts were
above the maximum count seen with the negative control in at least 5 samples in any group. Of 248
genes, 161 were included in the subsequent analysis. For each included gene, a linear regression model
was fitted with “group” as the independent variable of interest. Robust standard errors were estimated
using the Huber-White method for the coefficients. The mean of the expression levels determined for
each group was used to calculate the fold change between groups. P values for testing the mean
difference between groups were adjusted using the Benjamini & Hochberg method. Volcano plots were
generated using the fold change values and adjusted P values. A gene was selected as a “winner”gene
if the adjusted P value was lower than 0.1 and the fold change value was higher than 2 or lower than
0.5. A heat map of the winner genes was produced to visualize the clustering of samples and genes.

Bacterial burden in mouse organs. Liver was collected from the mouse with sanitized instruments
and immediately placed in 1 ml of PBS in a 12-well plate. After the tissue was minced with scissors, 20 ml
of the supernatant was drawn off and serially diluted. Dilutions were plated on sheep blood agar plates
under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. After 24 h, the plates were collected and CFU levels were
calculated and normalized to the weight of the liver. Cecum was also collected using sanitized
instruments, and contents were expelled by applying pressure to the organ with a scalpel. The contents
were then collected and put into a 1.5-ml tube. The weight of the contents was recorded; PBS was added;
and the slurry was subjected to vortex mixing, serially diluted, and plated onto sheep blood agar plates
(Anaerobe Systems). After 24 h, CFU counts were performed and the data were normalized to the weight
of each sample.
Tissue protein quantification, PGE2 measures, and multiplex analysis. Total cecum protein was
isolated from ceca prewashed with ice-cold PBS, homogenized by the use of a tissue shredder (Tis-
suemiser), and then centrifuged for 3 min at 8,600 � g. Supernatants of these preparations were
submitted for Luminex analysis of the provided analytes using x-map technology via the use of a
MapgPix system in combination with multiplex kits from Millipore Sigma. Total tissue protein content
was quantified by detergent-compatible (DC) assay. Data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism 6.0, and
heat maps were generated using Morpheus software from the Broad Institute (https://software
.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/). Supernatants of colon explants were incubated for 12 h in RPMI medium
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and GlutaMAX in an incubator at 37°
C and 5% CO2
saturation and were used to measure PGE2 concentrations with a PGE2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) kit (Cayman Chemical) following manufacturer’
s instructions.
Flow cytometry. Cell suspensions from the mesenteric lymph nodes, peritoneal lavage fluid, and
colon lamina propria were obtained from euthanized mice at the indicated time points. Cell suspensions
were incubated with Fc-block for 15 min on ice and then surface stained with a cocktail containing
monoclonal anti-mouse antibodies, including anti-CD19 (1D3), CD8a (5H10-1), anti-CD49b (DX5), anti-
CD11b (M1/70), anti-CD11c (N418), and anti-CD196 (x29-2I.17) from BioLegend as well as anti-CD4
(RM4-5) and anti-Ly6G (1A8) from BD. After 30 min of incubation on ice, cells were washed, fixed, and
permeabilized using a FoxP3 Fix/Perm buffer kit from eBioscience/Thermo Fisher, and intracellular
staining for ROR�t (clone Q31-378) was performed as a last step. Flow cytometry data were obtained with
BD FACSDiva 7.0 software and .fcs 3.0 files analyzed with FlowJo software.

Samples were neutralized with 125 mM glycine–PBS, postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, and sequentially
dehydrated with 15%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, and 100% ethanol. Samples were then infiltrated with Spurr’

For immunofluorescence microscopy, tissue samples were frozen in OCT embedding medium
(Tissue-Tek; Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA) and stored at �80°
C. OCT-mounted tissue samples were
sectioned at 3 �M thickness and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde–PBS (pH 7.4) for 20 min at room
temperature. Samples were washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100–PBS, quenched with
50 mM NH4Cl–PBS, and then blocked with 5% IgG-free bovine serum albumin (BSA)–PBS. Primary
antibodies used were 1:50 dilutions of rabbit anti-occludin and rabbit anti-ZO1 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA).
Samples were incubated with primary antisera overnight at 4°
C and then washed three times with 1%
IgG-free BSA–PBS. Secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG) were added at
8 �g/ml in 5% IgG-free BSA for 1 h. Samples were washed with PBS, stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-
phenylindole (DAPI), and mounted in ProLong Diamond antifade reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA). Images were captured using a DeltaVision Elite deconvolution microscope (GE Healthcare,
Pittsburgh, PA) equipped with an Olympus 100�/1.40 oil objective, immersion oil (n � 1.516), and GE
Healthcare Software Version 6.5.2. ImageJ 1.51j8 (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MA) was used
to merge and pseudocolor images.
Colon histology and pathology scoring. Colons from experimental mice were collected at day 3
postinfection and then flushed with cold PBS, opened longitudinally, and rolled to generate Swiss rolls.
The colon rolls were fixed for 5 days in 10% buffered Formalin phosphate and then transferred to 70%
ethanol for 7 days. After that, the Swiss rolls were used to generate paraffin blocks that were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and scored for the degree of injuries as described by Theriot et al. (74).
DNA extraction, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and gut microbiota analyses. Fresh fecal samples
were collected from individual mice prior to (baseline) and following treatment with cefoperazone,
indomethacin, or a combination of cefoperazone and indomethacin. In a subset of mice (n � 6/group),
fecal samples were collected for the time course of a posttreatment 11-day recovery period. Following
collection, fecal samples were immediately put on ice and subsequently frozen for storage at �20°
C.
Microbial genomic DNA was extracted using a 96-well PowerSoil DNA isolation kit (Qiagen). For each
sample, the V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced using an Illumina
MiSeq Sequencing platform as described elsewhere (86). Sequences were curated using the mothur
software package (v1.40.3) as previously described (6, 86, 87). Briefly, the workflow that we used included
generating contigs with paired-end reads, filtering low-quality sequences, aligning the resulting se-
quences to the SILVA 16S rRNA sequence database, and removing any chimeric sequences flagged by
UCHIME. Following curation, we obtained between 9 and 83,525 sequences per sample (median �
13,161.5), with a median length of 253 bp. To minimize the impact of uneven sampling, the number of
sequences in each sample was rarefied to 4,200. Sequences were clustered into OTUs based on a 3%
distance cutoff calculated using the OptiClust algorithm. All sequences were classified using the
Ribosomal Database Project training set (version 16), and OTUs were assigned a taxonomic classification
using a naive Bayesian classifier. Significantly altered OTUs for each group were selected using the
biomarker discovery algorithm LEfSe (linear discriminant analysis [LDA] effect size) in mothur (90).
�-Diversity was calculated using the Shannon diversity index, and �-diversity was calculated using the
�YC distance metric with OTU frequency data. Pairwise analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was used
to test the statistical significance of the results of comparisons between treatment groups using the �YC
distance metric.
