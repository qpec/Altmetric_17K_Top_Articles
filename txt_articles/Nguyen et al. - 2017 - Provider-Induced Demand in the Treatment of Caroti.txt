IMPORTANCE Although many factors influence the management of carotid artery stenosis, it
is not well understood whether a preference toward procedural management exists when
procedural volume and physician compensation are linked in the fee-for-service
environment.
OBJECTIVE To explore evidence for provider-induced demand in the management of carotid
artery stenosis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Department of Defense Military Health System
Data Repository was queried for individuals diagnosed with carotid artery stenosis between
October 1, 2006, and September 30, 2010. A hierarchical multivariable model evaluated the
association of the treatment system (fee-for-service physicians in the private sector vs
salary-based military physicians) with the odds of procedural intervention (carotid
endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting) compared with medical management. Subanalysis
was performed by symptom status at the time of presentation. The association of treatment
system and of management strategy with clinical outcomes, including stroke and death, was
also evaluated. Data analysis was conducted from August 15, 2015, to August 2, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The odds of procedural intervention based on treatment
system was the primary outcome used to indicate the presence and effect of
provider-induced demand.
RESULTS Of 10 579 individuals with a diagnosis of carotid artery stenosis (4615 women and
5964 men; mean [SD] age, 65.6 [11.4] years), 1307 (12.4%) underwent at least 1 procedure.
After adjusting for demographic and clinical factors, the odds of undergoing procedural
management were significantly higher for patients in the fee-for-service system compared
with those in the salary-based setting (odds ratio, 1.629; 95% CI, 1.285-2.063; P < .001). This
finding remained true when patients were stratified by symptom status at presentation
(symptomatic: odds ratio, 2.074; 95% CI, 1.302-3.303; P = .002; and asymptomatic: odds
ratio, 1.534; 95% CI, 1.186-1.984; P = .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Individuals treated in a fee-for-service system were
significantly more likely to undergo procedural management for carotid stenosis compared
with those in the salary-based setting. These findings remained consistent for individuals
with and without symptomatic disease.

 S
troke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the
United States and other developed countries,1 with an
estimated prevalence of 8% and an annual incidence of
2% to 8.8% among the elderly.2 A major preventable cause of
ischemic stroke is occlusive disease of the extracranial ca-
rotid arteries due to atherosclerosis. The resulting carotid ste-
nosis (CS) can be managed either through reduction of risk fac-
tors and medical management or interventions such as carotid
endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting.
The choice of therapy for CS depends on several clinical
factors, including the degree of stenosis and whether the pa-
tient is symptomatic or asymptomatic from the lesion. Sev-
eral large randomized clinical trials have provided evidence
of current professional societal guidelines3 for the treatment
of CS. Medical management, consisting of antiplatelet therapy,
use of a cholesterol-lowering agent, and control of hyperten-
sion, is recommended for all patients with CS. In addition, ca-
rotid endarterectomy is also recommended for symptomatic
patients with 50% to 99% stenosis, as well as for patients with
60% to 99% stenosis who are asymptomatic but have a good
risk profile. Based on the results of randomized clinical trials
and meta-analyses, stenting is generally reserved for patients
with high surgical risk and is performed by clinicians who have
placed a high volume of carotid artery stents.4,5
Recently, there has been greater support for medical man-
agement in all asymptomatic patients regardless of the de-
gree of stenosis. Proponents of this strategy point to the small
relative benefit of surgery compared with medical manage-
ment in these patients in the age of statins.6 Complicating this
debate is the fact that some of the stakeholders may be influ-
enced by the potential financial gains or losses that accom-
pany any broad change in treatment guidelines.
In the United States, most physicians work in a fee-
for-service (FFS) compensation structure in which their
income is associated directly with clinical volume. Proce-
dures in particular are reimbursed at a higher relative rate than
noninterventional management because of their intensity and
complexity.7 Provider-induced demand (PID) is an economic
term that refers to a greater demand for services than what
would otherwise be expected in a perfect market. In this con-
text, the term provider refers to physicians who care for pa-
tients in different reimbursement models. Provider-induced
demandcandevelopwhenphysiciansorotherhealthcarepro-
fessionals influence the consumption of health care through
increased procedures, more complex procedures, or both. Pro-
vider-induceddemandarisesfrominformationasymmetrybe-
tween patients, who are almost inevitably less informed as to
the details of their conditions and options for treatment, and
clinicians, on whom patients then rely for treatment recom-
mendations. Thus, a potential conflict of interest exists when
a clinician serves as the patient’
s agent in making medical de-
cisions while also acting as the supplier of those same ser-
vices being recommended. The conflict can be exacerbated in
FFS systems in which clinicians can financially benefit from
the recommendations they make on behalf of their patients.
A variety of evidence supports the existence and extent
of PID in the modern era. Groups have shown wide dispari-
ties in health care spending across geographic regions that is
not accounted for by demographic or health factors.8 A direct
association has also been found between the number of sur-
geons per capita and the rates of surgical procedures per-
formed in a geographic area.9,10 Physicians also seem to re-
spond to changes in reimbursement by adjusting the volume
of patients cared for in predictable patterns,11 suggesting that
physicians do not behave to maximize incomes but rather to
achieve target incomes in a trade-off for other activities, such
as leisure time.12 Those who argue against the existence of PID
claim that physicians are bound by professional, ethical, and
regulatory restrictions.13
Prior work on PID has used data from studies in which
health care use was assessed before and after a change in
reimbursement or compensation structure.9,11,12,14,15 In this
study, we sought to determine whether PID exists in the care
of CS by analyzing a contemporary population of patients
cared for by physicians with different compensation struc-
tures. Patients covered by the Military Health System’
s
TRICARE program can receive their care from both salaried
military physicians and FFS physicians in the private sector.
We hypothesized that, consistent with PID, patients in the
TRICARE program would be more likely to receive interven-
tions for CS from private-sector FFS physicians in the pur-
chased care (PC) system than from their salaried counter-
parts in the direct care (DC) system. We also hypothesized
that the differences in intervention rates in the DC and PC
systems would be greater among patients with asymptom-
atic CS compared with patients with symptomatic CS, for
which intervention is less debated, suggesting that the
observed variation in rates depends on the level of discre-
tion that the physician has in determining treatment
options.

Question Is the variation in care for carotid stenosis seen
between reimbursement systems consistent with the concept of
provider-induced demand?
Findings In this database study of 10 579 individuals with carotid
artery stenosis, the adjusted odds of undergoing carotid
endarterectomy or stenting were significantly higher in the
fee-for-service setting than in the salary-based setting for both
symptomatic and asymptomatic disease.
Meaning Individuals with both symptomatic and asymptomatic
carotid stenosis treated in a fee-for-service system were
significantly more likely to undergo procedural management when
compared with those in the salary-based system.

 this collaboration, we created a database consisting of pa-
tients residing within the continental United States enrolled
in either TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Plus from October 1,
2006, to September 30, 2010. The source of these data is the
Military Health System Data Repository. TRICARE is the health
careprogramservingactivemembersoftheUSUniformedSer-
vices, retirees, and their families. TRICARE is a part of the US
Department of Defense Military Health System and is admin-
istered by the Defense Health Agency. This study was ap-
proved by the Partners Institutional Review Board. As this was
a retrospective analysis of a large database with no patient con-
tact, the Partners Institutional Review Board waived the need
for consent. Patient data were deidentified before analysis.
We restricted our analysis to patients enrolled in
TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Plus, who are each assigned a
primary care manager who oversees the patient’
s care.
Although TRICARE Prime enrollees could possibly receive
care that is not performed within or reimbursed by the Mili-
tary Health System, similar to health maintenance organiza-
tions, it seems more likely that the patient care will be con-
solidated within TRICARE since each enrollee has a primary
care manager and, as such, their care is more completely
documented. The same reasoning holds for TRICARE Plus
enrollees, who are older than 65 years but subject to similar
business processes (ie, are assigned a primary care man-
ager). Second, patients in TRICARE Prime or Plus have low
or no enrollment fees and copayments and no deductibles,
which essentially eliminates the possibility that patient out-
of-pocket costs might be a potential factor in treatment deci-
sions. Medicare eligibility by age or disability is also tracked
in the Military Health System Data Repository and was
included as a covariate to account for dual enrollment. The
Military Health System is distinct in both structure and man-
date from the US Department of Veterans Affairs.
Statistical Analysis
Data analysis was conducted from August 15, 2015, to August
2, 2016. The longitudinal medical record of each patient was
divided into encounters consisting of a CS diagnosis, a query
forcarotidinterventionvsmedicalmanagementonly,andclini-
cal end points of stroke, transient ischemic attack, acute myo-
cardial infarction, and mortality. To minimize diagnostic vari-
ability, only individuals who received a diagnosis of CS by a
cardiologist or vascular surgeon were included in the analy-
sis. Clinical outcomes were then referenced to time periods of
30 days, 1 year, and 2 years after carotid intervention or diag-
nosis of CS. Patients were assigned to the DC or PC designa-
tion based the system in which they received their diagnosis.
Bivariate models were performed using 2-tailed t tests
for continuous variables and χ2 tests for frequencies. Multi-
variable hierarchical logistic regression models (PROC
MIXED; SAS Institute Inc) for the dependent outcome of
carotid intervention (carotid endarterectomy or carotid
artery stenting) were created for all encounters. Indepen-
dent factors in the model included patient demographics
and CS-associated clinical factors, with risk stratification by
use of the hierarchical condition categories (HCCs).16 Analy-
sis was clustered by catchment area as a proxy for geographi-
cal region. An HCC community score was also calculated to
generate an index score of comorbidity for group compari-
sons. This calculation was repeated for clinical outcome
variables including stroke, death, and a composite outcome
variable including stroke, transient ischemic attack, and
acute myocardial infarction. An α of .05, corresponding to
P = .05 and 95% CIs, was used as the criterion for statistical
significance. Data manipulation and statistical analysis were
performed using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
From October 1, 2006, to September 30, 2010, a total of 47 420
Prime and Plus enrollees had at least 1 diagnosis of carotid ar-
tery stenosis. Of those, 10 579 were diagnosed by either a car-
diologist or vascular surgeon, and 1307 (12.4%) also under-
wentacarotidintervention(endarterectomyorstenting)rather
than medical management alone. On average, patients using
the PC system (n = 3589) were younger than those using the
DC system (n = 6990) (mean [SD] age, 58.1 [7.6] vs 69.5 [11.0]
years at first diagnosis; P < .001; 61.7 [6.4] vs 69.5 [9.3] years
at procedure; P < .001), more likely to be symptomatic (641
[17.9%] vs 271 [3.9%]; P < .001), more likely to be female (1777
[49.5%] vs 2838 [40.6%]; P < .001), more likely to be married
(3022 [84.2%] vs 5509 [78.8%]; P < .001), and less likely to be
eligible for Medicare (346 [9.6%] vs 4722 [67.6%]; P < .001)
(Table 1). Patients in the PC group were also less likely to re-
port current or prior tobacco use (962 [26.8%] vs 3149 [45.1%];
P < .001) and had lower rates of diabetes (406 [11.3%] vs 1220
[17.5%], P < .001), congestive heart failure (153 [4.3%] vs 400
[5.7%]; P = .001), previous myocardial infarction (77 [2.1%] vs
255 [3.6%]; P < .001), peripheral vascular disease (198 [5.5%]
vs 652 [9.3%]; P < .001), chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease (194 [5.4%] vs 508 [7.3%]; P < .001), and renal failure (136
[3.8%] vs 533 [7.6%]; P < .001) (Table 1). In univariate analy-
sis, with medical management, the percentage of patients who
developed stroke was significantly higher among the PC group
than those in the DC group at 30 days (PC, 271 of 2943 [9.2%];
DC, 145 of 6329 [2.3%]; P < .001), 1 year (PC, 353 [12.0%]; DC,
282 [4.5%]; P < .001), and 2 years (PC, 393 [13.4%]; DC, 361
[5.7%]; P < .001) (Table 2). The percentage of patients who de-
veloped transient ischemic attack was also higher in the PC
group than the DC group at 30 days (PC, 315 [10.7%]; DC, 252
[4.0%]; P < .001), 1 year (PC, 457 [15.5%]; DC, 450 [7.1%];
P < .001), and 2 years (PC, 524 [17.8%]; DC, 565 [8.9%];
P < .001).Acutemyocardialinfarctionat30days(PC,56[1.9%];
DC, 79 [1.2%]; P = .01) was also higher among the PC group.
Death at 1 year (PC, 51 [1.7%]; DC, 165 [2.6%]; P = .009) and at
2 years (PC, 82 [2.8%]; DC, 327 [5.2%]; P < .001) was lower
among the PC group.
For patients who underwent a procedure, there was no sig-
nificant difference in death at 30 days (PC, 4 of 646 [0.6%];
DC,2of661[0.3%];P = .40),1year(PC,14[2.2%];DC,16[2.4%];
P = .76), and 2 years (PC, 19 [2.9%]; DC, 25 [3.8%]; P = .40).
Stroke at 30 days (PC, 72 [11.2%]; DC, 44 [6.7%]; P = .004), 1
year (PC, 99 [15.3%]; DC, 68 [10.3%]; P = .006), and 2 years (PC,

(PC,30[4.6%];DC,50[7.6%];P = .03)(Table2).Compositeout-
comes were more common among the PC group than the DC
group at all time points (Table 2).
In multivariable analysis, patients in the PC system were
more likely to receive an intervention for CS than were pa-
tients in the DC system (odds ratio [OR], 1.629; 95% CI, 1.285-
2.063; P < .001) (Table 3).17 The odds of receiving an interven-
tionwerealsohigheramongsymptomaticpatientsthanamong
asymptomatic patients (OR, 9.487; 95% CI, 7.611-11.824;
P < .001). A higher HCC score was associated with lower odds
of receiving an intervention (OR, 0.815; 95% CI, 0.730-0.910;
P < .001). In subanalyses by symptomatic status, the effect of
receiving care in the PC system on carotid intervention was
higher in symptomatic patients (OR, 2.074; 95% CI, 1.302-
3.303; P = .002) compared with asymptomatic patients (OR,
1.534; 95% CI, 1.186-1.984; P = .001) (Table 4).
Clinical outcomes, including stroke, death, and a com-
posite outcome, were also examined in a multivariable
model controlling for age, HCC score, Medicare eligibility,
sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, smoking history, and
symptomatic status. Outcomes were examined at 30 days, 1
year, and 2 years from the time of diagnosis for patients in
the medical management group and from the time of proce-
dure (carotid artery stenting or carotid endarterectomy) for

Discussion
Carotid stenosis is a prevalent manifestation of atheroscle-
rotic disease with significant morbidity and mortality.
Although several prospective clinical trials have shown a
potential benefit for carotid intervention in many patients,
particularly those with symptomatic or high-grade stenosis,
management of CS remains a topic of much debate.6,18-21
Advocates of medical management for CS assert that recent
developments in medications and management goals have
greatly improved outcomes of medical management com-
pared with intervention.21,22 This clinical equipoise helps to
establish an environment in which provider discretion and
patient preference may influence treatment decisions. It
also creates a situation in which nonclinical factors, includ-
ing potential financial compensation, may influence care.
When controlling for demographic and clinical variables,
our analysis found a significant increase in the odds of
undergoing an intervention for CS in the PC setting of the
Military Health System. What is unique about the population
in question is that, rather than demonstrating variation in
health care by geography or over time, the current study
demonstrates variation in health care use by clinician reim-
bursement type in a synchronous national cohort. The find-
ing that the odds of intervention are higher among patients
in the PC group compared with those in the DC group sug-
gests that such variation may be associated with clinician
compensation structure.
Our findings are consistent with prior publications that
demonstrate PID. Helmchen and Lo Sasso23 demonstrated in-
creasing rates of encounters and procedures among primary
care physicians when transitioning from a salaried reimburse-
ment structure to an FFS model. Nguyen and Derrick14 also
demonstrated an increase in clinician volume to recoup losses
to decreasing Medicare reimbursement, with a 10% decrease
in Medicare reimbursement triggering an estimated 4% to 8%
increase in volume for the clinicians facing the largest price
reductions. Falling birth rates have also been shown to trig-
ger an increase in cesarean deliveries, a more lucrative proce-
dure compared with vaginal delivery.9
Although our results are consistent with these findings,
based on these results alone it is difficult to claim whether the
differences in intervention rates between patients in the DC
setting and those in the PC setting represent overtreatment in
the PC system or undertreatment in the DC system. We did at-
tempt to address this issue, however, via subanalysis using
symptomaticstatusinCSasaproxyforappropriatenessofcare.
Most would agree that, for symptomatic patients, there is
greaterconsensusaboutthebenefitsofinterventionthanthere
is for asymptomatic patients.22,24 Thus, one would expect a
higher rate of appropriate (non-PID) intervention in sympto-
matic patients; in turn, the comparative rate of intervention

 for these patients would suggest that the system performed
at what could be thought to be a more appropriate level of care.
In this study, symptomatic patients, who by definition were
at higher risk for complications after intervention, were also
more likely to receive intervention in the PC system, suggest-
ing a more aggressive clinical approach by clinicians in the PC
setting. In other words, interventions are often indicated for
many diseases, and higher rates of interventions alone are not
detrimental. Our data showed that symptomatic patients
within the DC system were less likely to undergo a procedure
from which they may have benefited, which may represent un-
dertreatment within the DC system rather than overtreat-
ment in the PC system. Taken together, the evidence also sug-
gests a component of clinical aggressiveness and risk-taking
that explains some of the differences in health care use seen.
This finding is consistent with prior work showing an associa-
tion between clinicians in competitive markets and their use
of riskier kidneys in renal transplantation for patients with
fewer alternatives.25
Limitations
This study has significant limitations. The source data are
administrative and are subject to coding error and cases of
inadequate specificity, as is most notable in the coding of
the race/ethnicity value, for which 5242 patients (49.6%)
had missing information, a previously described limitation
of this data set.26 The diagnosis of CS is available for analy-
sis, but the degree of stenosis is not available for inclusion.
As such, we cannot completely control for the appropriate-
ness of the decisions beyond patients having a diagnosis of
CS and an assumption that clinicians act within the bound-
aries of acceptable medical practice. Information surround-
ing the compensation structure for specific physicians was
not available, and it is likely that a subset of physicians
within the PC system are employed by their institutions.
However, while physicians may not be reimbursed in an
immediate FFS manner, they and the system in which they
operate remain subject to these pressures, reflected in pro-
ductivity bonuses and Relative Value Unit goals that may
incentivize physicians or physician groups toward the pro-
vision of procedures. Furthermore, while salaries are a
major portion of clinician compensation, other incentives
exist that may influence a clinician’
s treatment decisions.
Surgeons who perform a high volume of procedures may
gain personal and social benefits of being recognized for
their proficiency and expertise regardless of their compen-
sation system. Interventionists also seek to maintain techni-
cal proficiency and thus would be motivated to maintain
clinical volume. To the extent that these factors exist, they
would likely bias the findings toward the null rather than
toward our findings since they can affect clinicians in both
the PC and DC systems. Finally, it is possible that these
results reflect variation in patient mix or referral patterns
incompletely captured by the data available. Although the
HCC score was used to control for comorbidities, it is likely
that clinical factors also affected management decisions at
the level of individual clinicians. Despite this limitation,
which is common to most studies that use administrative
data, on balance, the overall trend in the provision of care
does appear to be in line with PID as an economic model.
These limitations notwithstanding, our analysis repre-
sents a very large national cohort of patients who concur-
rently exist in 1 of 2 health care systems that differ by the
compensation mechanism of its clinicians, a model some-
what unique to this data set. The assignment to each system
greatly depends on the geographical location of the patient,
a factor in itself not associated with the clinical presentation
or outcome of treatment. The higher rates of intervention
for CS in the PC setting are consistent with PID for this
disease in this patient population. However, the treatment
of symptomatic patients in this cohort suggests that the
clinicians in the PC system are appropriately aggressive
toward CS.
Conclusions
Although it is difficult to capture fully the factors that moti-
vate patients and clinicians, with respect to the manage-
ment of CS by surgeons and other interventionists, our
results do appear to support the conclusion that PID may be
at work. Given these findings, the health care community
should focus on ways to detect the potential for PID and
craft policies that will align the incentives of patients, clini-
cians, and society. Further analysis of the appropriateness
of care and noncompensation incentives may improve our
understanding of the role between incentives and health
care use.
