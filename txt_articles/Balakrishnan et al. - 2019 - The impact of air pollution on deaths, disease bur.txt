The impact of air pollution on deaths, disease burden, 
and life expectancy across the states of India: the Global 
Burden of Disease Study 2017
India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative Air Pollution Collaborators*
Summary
Background Air pollution is a major planetary health risk, with India estimated to have some of the worst levels globally. 
To inform action at subnational levels in India, we estimated the exposure to air pollution and its impact on deaths, 
disease burden, and life expectancy in every state of India in 2017.
Methods We estimated exposure to air pollution, including ambient particulate matter pollution, defined as the annual 
average gridded concentration of PM2.5, and household air pollution, defined as percentage of households using solid 
cooking fuels and the corresponding exposure to PM2.5, across the states of India using accessible data from multiple 
sources as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017. The states were categorised 
into three Socio-demographic Index (SDI) levels as calculated by GBD 2017 on the basis of lag-distributed per-capita 
income, mean education in people aged 15 years or older, and total fertility rate in people younger than 25 years. We 
estimated deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributable to air pollution exposure, on the basis of exposure–
response relationships from the published literature, as assessed in GBD 2017; the proportion of total global air pollution 
DALYs in India; and what the life expectancy would have been in each state of India if air pollution levels had been less 
than the minimum level causing health loss.
Findings The annual population-weighted mean exposure to ambient particulate matter PM2·5 in India was 89·9 μg/m³ 
(95% uncertainty interval [UI] 67·0–112·0) in 2017. Most states, and 76·8% of the population of India, were exposed to 
annual population-weighted mean PM2·5 greater than 40 μg/m³, which is the limit recommended by the National 
Ambient Air Quality Standards in India. Delhi had the highest annual population-weighted mean PM2·5 in 2017, followed 
by Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Haryana in north India, all with mean values greater than 125 μg/m³. The proportion of 
population using solid fuels in India was 55·5% (54·8–56·2) in 2017, which exceeded 75% in the low SDI states of Bihar, 
Jharkhand, and Odisha. 1·24 million (1·09–1·39) deaths in India in 2017, which were 12·5% of the total deaths, were 
attributable to air pollution, including 0·67 million (0·55–0·79) from ambient particulate matter pollution and 
0·48 million (0·39–0·58) from household air pollution. Of these deaths attributable to air pollution, 51·4% were in 
people younger than 70 years. India contributed 18·1% of the global population but had 26·2% of the global air pollution 
DALYs in 2017. The ambient particulate matter pollution DALY rate was highest in the north Indian states of Uttar 
Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi, Punjab, and Rajasthan, spread across the three SDI state groups, and the household air 
pollution DALY rate was highest in the low SDI states of Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Assam in north 
and northeast India. We estimated that if the air pollution level in India were less than the minimum causing health loss, 
the average life expectancy in 2017 would have been higher by 1·7 years (1·6–1·9), with this increase exceeding 2 years in 
the north Indian states of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Haryana.
Interpretation India has disproportionately high mortality and disease burden due to air pollution. This burden is 
generally highest in the low SDI states of north India. Reducing the substantial avoidable deaths and disease burden 
from this major environmental risk is dependent on rapid deployment of effective multisectoral policies throughout 
India that are commensurate with the magnitude of air pollution in each state.

Introduction
Air pollution contributes substantially to premature mor­
tality and disease burden globally, with a greater impact in 
low­income and middle­income countries than in high­
income countries.1,2 India has one of the highest exposure 
levels to air pollution globally.1 The major components of 
air pollution are ambient particulate matter pollution, 
household air pollu 
tion, and to a smaller extent ozone in 
the troposphere, the lowest layer of atmosphere. In India, 
the major sources of ambient particulate matter pollution 
are coal burning for thermal power production, industry 
emissions, construction activity and brick kilns, transport

vehicles, road dust, residential and commercial biomass 
burning, waste burning, agricultural stubble burning, and 
diesel generators.3–11 Household air pollution is caused 
mainly by the residential burning of solid fuels for cooking 
and to some extent heating, the major types of which are 
wood, dung, agricultural residues, coal, and charcoal.12–14 
Ground level ambient ozone is produced when nitrogen 
oxides and volatile organic compounds emitted from 
transport vehicles, power plants, factories, and other 
sources react in the presence of sunlight.15 Rapidly 
developing countries such as India face the dual challenge 
of exposures from both ambient and household air 
pollution.16 There has been an increasing focus on 
addressing air pollution in India by the government and 
other stakeholders in recent times.17–24
India had a population of 1·38 billion in 2017 spread 
across 29 states and seven union territories, many of which 
are as large as some countries and are at varying levels of 
development, leading to a heterogeneous distribution of 
health risks and their impact.25 The India State­Level 
Disease Burden Initiative has reported the overall trends of 
diseases, injuries, and risk factors from 1990 to 2016 for 
every state of India as part of the Global Burden of 
Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016, 
and also detailed trends of some major non­communicable 
diseases and suicide.25–31 According to these findings, air 
pollution was the second largest risk factor contributing to 
disease burden in India after malnutrition in 2016, with an 
increasing trend in exposure to ambient particulate matter 
pollution and a decreasing trend in household air 
pollution.25,26 Another study has used satellite­based am­
bient particulate matter estimates for 2001–10 to highlight 
variations in the exposure levels at the district level in India 
and its contribution to deaths from various causes.32 These 
investigators also projected a continuing increase in 
ambient particulate matter pollution in India in the 
foreseeable future.33 Two studies have previously estimated 
the impact of air pollution on life expectancy in India.34,35
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Existing evidence suggests that India, with a population of 
1·38 billion people living across states at different levels of 
economic, social, and health development, has one of the highest 
air pollution levels in the world. Evidence also suggests that air 
pollution is a major risk factor for disease burden. We searched 
PubMed and publicly available reports for estimates of the burden 
attributable to air pollution, including ambient air pollution and 
household air pollution, across the states of India using the search 
terms “air pollutants”, “air pollution”, “ambient particulate matter 
pollution”, “burden”, “DALY”, “death”, “epidemiology”, 
"household air pollution", “impact”, “India”, “indoor pollution”, 
“life expectancy”, “morbidity”, “mortality”, “ozone concentration”, 
“PM2·5 exposure”, and “sources of emission” on Sept 14, 2018, 
without language or publication date restrictions. We found 
several previous studies that have estimated subnational 
variations in ambient particulate matter and household air 
pollution exposure in India and their contribution to deaths from 
various causes. However, a comprehensive understanding of the 
variations between the states of India in the exposure to the 
major components of air pollution, the associated deaths and 
disease burden, and the impact on life expectancy is not available 
in a single standardised framework to inform relevant policy 
interventions commensurate with the situation in each state.
Added value of this study
This study provides a comprehensive assessment of the exposure 
to air pollution and its impact on deaths, disease burden, and life 
expectancy in every state of India in 2017 using the unified Global 
Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study framework, 
which includes 359 diseases or injuries and 84 risk factors. Using 
improved GBD 2017 methods for air pollution, we report the 
separate impact of ambient particulate matter pollution and 
household air pollution for every state, avoiding overestimation of 
this impact in people exposed to both. Our findings highlight that 
77% of India’s population was exposed to an annual population-
weighted mean PM2·5  greater than 40 μg/m³ in 2017, which is the 
level recommended by the National Ambient Air Quality 
Standards in India, and none of the Indian states met the 
WHO-recommended criteria of ambient particulate matter air 
quality of less than 10 μg/m³. Even with substantial increasing 
provision of clean cooking fuels in India, more than half of India’s 
population was exposed to household air pollution from solid 
cooking fuels in 2017. We report that one out of every eight deaths 
in India in 2017 could be attributed to air pollution. This study 
shows that India has a higher proportion of global health loss due 
to air pollution than its proportion of the global population. The 
findings of this study suggest that the impact of air pollution on 
deaths and life expectancy in India might be lower than previously 
estimated, but this impact is still quite substantial.
Implications of all the available evidence
The high level of air pollution in India is a major public health 
and development issue that has significant implications for 
planetary health. There are large variations between the states 
of India in exposure to ambient particulate matter pollution and 
household air pollution and the consequent health loss and 
deaths. Although control of air pollution is needed all over India, 
the heterogeneity between the states should be taken into 
account in designing policies and interventions consistent with 
the magnitude and sources of air pollution in each state. In 
addition to the existing interventions, concerted multisectoral 
efforts are needed related to power production, industry, 
transport, fuel use, urban planning, construction, and 
agriculture for controlling air pollution in India to mitigate its 
impact. Public and policy focus on the control of air pollution in 
India is increasing, which should be sustained to translate this 
positive trend into effective interventions.

Using improved air pollution methods in GBD 2017, we 
provide detailed findings on the exposure to ambient 
particulate matter pollution and household air pollution, 
and their separate impacts on deaths, disease burden, and 
life expectancy in every state of India, as well as the impact 
of overall air pollution, to inform policy and interventions.
Methods
Overview
The analysis and findings of air pollution presented in 
this report were produced by the India State­Level Disease 
Burden Initiative as part of GBD 2017
. The work of this 
Initiative has been approved by the Health Ministry 
Screening Committee at the Indian Council of Medical 
Research and the ethics committee of the Public Health 
Foundation of India. A comprehensive description of the 
metrics, data sources, and statistical modelling for 
GBD 2017 has been reported elsewhere.25,26,36 The GBD 2017 
methods relevant for this paper are summarised here and 
described in detail in the appendix (pp 3–15).
Estimation of exposure to air pollution
The measure of exposure to ambient particulate matter 
pollution was the annual average PM2·5 concentration in 
the air at a spatial resolution of a 0·1° × 0·1° grid cell over 
the globe, which is 11 × 11 km at the equator.36–39 The 
estimates of ambient PM2·5 exposure in India were based 
on multiple satellite­based aerosol optical depth data 
combined with a chemical transport model, and calibration 
of these with PM2·5 data from ground­level monitoring 
stations.37–39 The data inputs are listed in the appendix 
(pp 21–26). In cases in which data on average PM10 
concentration were available but data on PM2·5 were not, 
estimates of ratios between the two were used to derive 
PM2·5 concentrations.36,39 A description of the modelling 
approach used to arrive at the annual population­weighted 
mean PM2·5 estimates from a combination of satellite­
based and ground­level data is published elsewhere.37–39 
Estimates in GBD 2017 included a substantially increased 
number of ground measurements compared with 
previous GBD cycles, including 185 sites with PM2·5 
measurements and 184 sites with PM10 measurements in 
India, and the model to calibrate satellite­based estimates 
to these measurements varied smoothly over space and 
time in regions with many measurements. Additionally, 
estimates of PM2·5 exposure uncertainty incorporate the 
posterior distribution in each grid cell from the calibration 
model. The methods for ambient particulate matter 
pollution estimation are provided in the appendix (pp 4–11).
The measure of household air pollution was exposure to 
PM2·5 due to use of solid cooking fuels (wood, dung, 
agricultural residues, coal, and charcoal), which was 
derived from the proportion of population using these 
fuels. Estimates of the proportion of population exposed to 
household air pollution from solid fuel use were modelled 
using spatiotemporal regression and Gaussian process 
regression techniques on population­based data on 
households using solid fuels. The average PM2·5 exposures 
from solid fuel use for different household members were 
derived from studies measuring 24­h kitchen and living 
area PM2·5 concentrations in households, estimating these 
for men, women, and children.36 The concentration of 
ambient PM2·5 for each location­year was then subtracted 
from these exposure estimates to provide an estimate of 
the incremental exposure due to household solid fuel use 
for cooking. This approach resulted in independent esti­
mates for PM2·5 exposure due to ambient particulate matter 
and household solid fuel use. The major data sources for 
solid fuel use in India included the national health surveys 
such as the National Family Health Survey and the District 
Level Household Survey, nationwide surveys of the 
National Sample Survey Organisation, and the Census of 
India as well as many other published and unpublished 
epidemiological studies (appendix pp 21–26). The methods 
for household air pollution estimation are described 
elsewhere and a summary is provided in the appendix 
(pp 11–13).36
Ozone exposure was defined as the highest seasonal 
(6­month) mean daily maximum 8­h average concentra­
tions of ozone in air as parts per billion for each 0·1° × 0·1° 
grid cell over the globe. These exposure estimates in 
GBD 2017 incorporated a new comprehensive global ozone 
ground measurement database.40 The burden attributable 
to ambient ozone pollution was estimated using chemical 
transport models. These methods are described elsewhere 
and in the appendix (pp 13, 14).36
Estimation of deaths and disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs) attributable to air pollution
The GBD comparative risk assessment framework was 
used to estimate disease burden attributable to risk factors, 
as described elsewhere.36 The risk–outcome pairs were 
selected to comply with the World Cancer Research Fund 
classification grades of convincing or probable evidence 
for a biologically plausible association between exposure 
and disease outcomes reported in multiple epidemiological 
studies in different populations. These studies included 
prospective observational studies and randomised con­
trolled trials. The relative risks for mortality from acute 
lower respiratory infections, ischaemic heart diseases, 
stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung 
cancer, and dia 
betes due to ambient and household ex­
posure to PM2·5 were estimated using integrated exposure–
response functions based on published relative risks at 
different PM2·5 concentrations, as described elsewhere and 
in the appendix (pp 4–13).36 The relative risk of cataract 
attributable to household use of solid fuels was generated 
from meta­analysis (appendix pp 11–13). The relative risk 
of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease attributable to 
ozone exposure was obtained from the literature (appendix 
pp 13, 14).
For each risk factor, the theoretical minimum risk 
exposure level was established as the lowest level of 
exposure below which its relationship with a disease

outcome is not supported by the available evidence. The 
theoretical minimum risk exposure level for ambient 
particulate matter and household air pollution was defined 
as a population­weighted mean PM2·5 between 2·4 and 
5·9 μg/m³, except for the attribution of cataract to 
household air pollution for which the theoretical minimum 
risk exposure level was defined as no exposure to solid 
fuel use for cooking.36 For ambient ozone pollution, the 
theoretical minimum risk exposure level was defined as a 
population­weighted concentration between 29·1 and 
35·7 parts per billion. Relative risk estimates were based 
on the contrast between current exposure and the lowest 
theoretical minimum risk exposure level consistent with 
the available scientific evidence.
To differentiate the disease burden from PM2·5 exposure 
due to household solid fuel use and ambient particulate 
matter pollution, the attributable relative risk estima­
tion approach using the integrated exposure–response 
function was modified in GBD 2017 compared with the 
previous GBD approach.36 Although everyone is exposed 
to some concentration of ambient particulate matter 
pollution, only a proportion of the population in each 
location use solid cooking fuels. For the proportion of the 
population not exposed to solid cooking fuel, the relative 
risk was based on the contrast between ambient PM2·5 
concentration and its theoretical mini 
mum risk exposure 
level. However, for the proportion of the population 
exposed to both household and ambient particulate 
matter pollution, a joint relative risk was calculated from 
the integrated exposure–response func 
tion according to 
the combined level of these exposures. This risk was 
divided between household air pollution and ambient 
particulate matter pollution on the basis of the proportion 
of each in the combined exposure. With this approach, 
the poten 
tial overestimation of disease burden among 
those in 
dividuals exposed to both household and ambient 
PM2·5 was avoided.
Population­attributable fractions for mortality and 
DALYs due to relative risks were estimated by location, 
year, age, and sex, using population attributable fractions 
derived from the published literature, as described in the 
appendix (pp 3–15) and elsewhere.36 GBD uses covariates, 
which are explanatory variables that have a known 
association with the outcome of interest, to arrive at the 
best possible estimate when data for the outcome are 
scarce but data for covariates are available.36,41,42 This 
approach was part of the estimation process for the 
findings presented in this report.
Analysis presented in this paper
We report findings for 31 geographical units in India: the 
29 states, the Union Territory of Delhi, and the union 
territories other than Delhi (combining the six smaller 
union territories of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, 
Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu, 
Lakshadweep, and Puducherry). We also present find­
ings for three groups of states based on their Socio­
demographic Index (SDI) as calculated by GBD.43 This 
SDI is a composite indicator of development status, 
which ranges from 0 to 1, and is a geometric mean of the 
values of the indices of lag­distributed per capita income, 
mean education in people aged 15 years or older, and total 
fertility rate in people younger than 25 years. The states 
were categorised into three state groups based on their 
SDI in 2017: low SDI (≤0·53), middle SDI (0·54–0·60), 
and high SDI (>0·60; appendix p 27).
We report the estimated exposure levels for ambient 
particulate matter PM2·5, percentage of households using 
solid fuels, and ambient ozone in 2017
. We estimated the 
deaths and DALYs attributable to air pollution, ambient 
particulate matter pollution and household air pollution 
in each state of India in 2017
. We report cause­specific 
DALYs attributable to air pollution in India in 2017, and 
compared these with DALYs attributable to tobacco use 
for the diseases attributable to both risk factors. We 
estimated what the life expectancy would have been in 
each state of India if air pollution concentrations had 
been less than the theoretical minimum risk exposure 
level causing health loss. For this analysis, the ratio of air 
pollution­deleted deaths to all­cause deaths was 
calculated as one minus the proportion of air pollution 
deaths. This ratio was then used to create air pollution­
deleted probability of death. Using this new probability 
of death, life tables were recalculated to get the life 
expectancies in the absence of air pollution. These 
computations were also done separately for ambient 
particulate matter pollution and household air pollution. 
We describe findings for ambient particulate and 
household air pollution in detail but not for ambient 
ozone pollution because this risk factor contributes only 
a small fraction of the health loss due to air pollution in 
India as well as globally. We assessed India’s contribution 
to the global DALYs attributable to air pollution in

Results
The annual exposure to ambient particulate matter, as 
the population­weighted mean PM2·5, in India in 2017 
was 89·9 μg/m³ (95% UI 67·0–112·0), which was one of 
the highest in the world (table 1; appendix p 28). The 
highest annual population­weighted mean PM2·5 in 
India in 2017 was in Delhi (209·0 μg/m³ [95% UI 
120·9–339·5]), followed by Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and 
Haryana in north India (range 125·7–174·7 μg/m³), and 
then in Rajasthan, Jharkhand, and West Bengal (range 
81·4–93·4 μg/m³; figure 1; appendix p 29). Exposure 
was highest in the low SDI state group (125·3 μg/m³ 
[95% UI 87·5–167·3]; table 1). Of the total population in 
India in 2017, 42·6% of residents were exposed to mean 
PM2·5 greater than 80 μg/m³ and 76·8% were exposed to 
mean PM2·5 greater than 40 μg/m³, which is the limit 
recommended by the National Ambient Air Quality 
Standards in India.44 Across the states of India, the 
annual population­weighted mean PM2·5 exposure was 
12·1 times greater in the state with the highest exposure 
than in the state with the lowest exposure in 2017
.
The proportion of the population using solid fuels in 
India in 2017 was 55·5% (95% UI 54·8–56·2). This 
proportion was highest in the low SDI state group (72·1% 
[71·1–73·0]; table 1); and highest in the low SDI states 
of Bihar, Jharkhand, and Odisha (range 76·7–81·5%), 
followed by Chhattisgarh, Assam, Madhya Pradesh, and 
Rajasthan in the low SDI state group and Meghalaya in the 
middle SDI state group (range 68·0–74·8%; figure 1; 
appendix p 29). Across the states of India, the proportion 
of the population using solid fuels in 2017 was 42·9 times 
greater in the state with the highest use than in the state 
with the lowest use. The annual exposure to population­
weighted ambient ozone concentration in India in 2017 
was 60·1 parts per billion (95% UI 59·9–60·2), with the 
highest exposure in the low SDI state groups (table 1).
In 2017, 1·24 million (95% UI 1·09–1·39) deaths in India 
were attributable to air pollution (table 2). Of the total 
deaths in India in 2017, 12·5% could be attributed to air 
pollution; this proportion was 10·8% in people younger 
than 70 years and 15·1% in those aged 70 years or older.36,41 
51·4% (49·9–54·1) of the deaths attributable to air pollution 
in India in 2017 were in people younger than 70 years 
(table 2). This proportion was higher in the low SDI group 
than the high SDI group, but there were variations within 
each SDI state group. For example, in the low SDI state 
group, this proportion was higher in Jharkhand, 
Chhattisgarh, and Bihar than in the other states, and in the 
high SDI state group, there was a striking contrast between 
states, with Punjab having a much higher proportion than 
Kerala (table 2). Across the states of India, the proportion 
of deaths attributable to air pollution in 2017 was 3·1 times 
greater in the state with the highest proportion than in the 
state with the lowest proportion.
The number of deaths attributable to ambient part­
iculate matter pollution in India in 2017 was 0·67 million 
(95% UI 0·55–0·79) and the number attributable to 
household air pollution was 0·48 million (0·39–0·58;

table 2). Among the low SDI states, the point estimate of 
the number of deaths attributable to ambient particulate 
matter pollution was two times higher than that of 
household air pollution in Uttar Pradesh and 1·4 times 
higher in Bihar, although with wide uncertainty ranges, 
consistent with the very high exposure to ambient 
particulate matter pollution in these states (table 2; 
appendix p 30). In most of the other low SDI states, 
however, the point estimate of the number of deaths 
attributable to household air pollution was higher than 
that of ambient particulate matter pollution, but again 
with wide uncertainty ranges. Delhi, in the high SDI 
state group, stands out as having an extreme contrast 
between the deaths attributable to ambient particulate 
matter pollution. Two other north Indian states, Haryana 
and Punjab, also had a higher number of deaths 
attributable to ambient parti 
culate matter pollution than 
attributable to household air pollution. In two neigh­
bouring high SDI states in south India, Tamil Nadu and 
Kerala, Tamil Nadu had twice the number of deaths 
attributable to ambient particulate matter pollution than 
to household air pollu 
tion, whereas Kerala had a similar 
number of deaths attributable to ambient particulate 
matter pollution than to household air pollution. These

findings were consistent with the higher exposure levels 
to ambient particulate matter pollution in Tamil Nadu 
than in Kerala, and vice versa for household air pollution 
exposure.
The point estimate for the number of deaths attributable 
to ambient particulate matter pollution in males in India 
in 2017 (0·39 million [95% UI 0·32–0·46]) was 38·3% 
higher than for females (0·28 million [0·22–0·34]), but

with some overlap in their 95% UIs (appendix p 30). By 
contrast, the point estimate for the number of deaths 
attributable to household air pollution in India in 2017 was 
17·6% higher for females (0·26 million [0·21–0·31]) than 
for males (0·22 million [0·17–0·28]), but with considerable 
overlap in their 95% UIs. Although the direction of these 
male versus female trends was similar in most states, 
there were many variations between the states in the 
magnitude of these differences (appendix p 30).
Of the total 480·7 million (441·7–526·3) DALYs in India 
in 2017, 38·7 million (34·5–42·4) or 8·1% (7·1–9·0) were 
attributable to air pollution. 21·3 million (17·7–25·1) or 
4·4% (3·7–5·3) of the total DALYs were attributable to 
ambient particulate matter pollution, 15·8 million 
(13·3–19·1) or 3·3% were attributable to household air 
pollution, and 2·6 million (0·9–4·2) or 0·5% (0·2–0·9) 
were attributable to ambient ozone pollution.36,42 The 
1·38 billion people in India in 2017 made up 18·1% of the 
global 7·64 billion population, but India had 38·7 million 
(26·2%) of the global 147·4 million DALYs attributable to 
air pollution in 2017
.42
The DALY rate attributable to household air pollution in 
2017 was 1·9 times higher in the low SDI group than in 
the high SDI group and the rate attributable to ambient 
particulate matter was 1·4 times higher in the low SDI 
group than the high SDI group (figure 2). The DALY rate 
attributable to ambient particulate matter pollution was 
highest in the north Indian states of Uttar Pradesh, 
Haryana, Delhi, Punjab, and Rajasthan, spread across the 
three SDI state groups. The DALY rate attributable to 
household air pollution was highest in the low SDI states 
of Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Assam 
in north and northeast India. The highest DALY rate due 
to household air pollution was 144·8 times the lowest rate 
and the highest rate due to ambient particulate matter 
pollution was 5·6 times the lowest. The overall DALY rate 
attributable to air pollution was highest in the states of 
Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, 
Haryana, Bihar, and Uttarakhand.
Of the total DALYs attributable to air pollution in India 
in 2017, the largest proportions were from lower 
respiratory infections (29·3%), chronic obstructive pul­
monary disease (29·2%), and ischaemic heart disease 
(23·8%), followed by stroke (7·5%), diabetes (6·9%), lung 
cancer (1·8%), and cataract (1·5%). The DALY rate 
attributable to air pollution in India in 2017 was much 
higher for lower respiratory infections than the rate 
attributable to tobacco use (figure 3). For non­
communicable diseases, including chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, ischaemic heart disease, stroke, 
diabetes, lung cancer, and cataract, the DALY rate 
attributable to air pollution was at least as high as the rate 
attributable to tobacco use.
If the air pollution levels in India had been lower than 
the theoretical minimum risk exposure levels associated 
with health loss, the average life expectancy in India in 
2017 would have been higher by 1·7 years (95% UI 
1·6–1·9; table 3), with this increase exceeding 2 years in 
the north Indian states of Rajasthan (2·5 years [2·0–2·8]), 
Uttar Pradesh (2·2 years [1·8–2·5]), and Haryana 
(2·1 years [1·9–2·4]). If the exposure to ambient particulate 
matter pollution had been lower than the minimum levels 
associated with health loss, the average life expectancy 
would have increased in India by 0·9 years (0·8–1·1), with 
the highest increase in Delhi (1·5 years [1·3–1·7]), 
Haryana (1·4 years [1·1–1·8]), Punjab (1·3 years [1·0–1·5]) 
and Uttar Pradesh (1·3 years [1·0–1·7]). If the exposure to 
household air pollution due to solid fuels had been lower 
than the minimum levels associated with health loss, the 
average life expectancy would have increased in India by 
0·7 years (0·6–0·8), with the highest increase in Rajasthan 
(1·0 years [0·8–1·3]), Chhattisgarh (0·9 years [0·7–1·1]), 
and Madhya Pradesh (0·9 years [0·7–1·1]). Generally, 
across the states, this beneficial impact on life expectancy 
would have been slightly higher for males in relation to 
ambient particulate matter pollution and slightly higher 
for females in relation to household air pollution, although 
the UIs overlap between the two sexes (appendix p 31).
Discussion
India has one of the highest annual average ambient 
particulate matter PM2·5 exposure levels in the world. In 
2017, no state in India had an annual population­
weighted ambient particulate matter mean PM2·5 less 
than the WHO recommended level of 10 μg/m³,45 and 
77% of India’s population was exposed to mean PM2·5 
more than 40 μg/m³, which is the recommended limit 
set by the National Ambient Air Quality Standards of 
India. Although the use of solid fuels for cooking has 
been declining in India,25,26 56% of India’s population was 
still exposed to household air pollution from solid fuels 
in 2017
. Behind these high overall air pollution exposure 
levels in India, there is a marked variation between the 
states, with a 12 times difference for ambient particulate 
matter pollution and 43 times difference for household 
air pollution. The low SDI states in north India had some 
of the highest levels of both ambient particulate matter 
and household air pollution, especially Bihar, Uttar

Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Jharkhand; and the middle and 
high SDI states Delhi, Haryana, and Punjab in north 
India had some of the highest ambient particulate matter 
pollution exposure in the country.
India had 18% of the global population in 2017, but had 
26% of global DALYs attributable to air pollution. A 
substantial 8% of the total disease burden in India and 
11% of premature deaths in people younger than 70 years 
could be attributed to air pollution. We estimated that 
1·24 million deaths in India in 2017 could be attributed to 
air pollution, including 0·67 million to ambient particu­
late matter pollution and 0·48 million to household air 
pollution. Furthermore, a report has suggested that there 
are additional diseases attributable to air pollution that 
are currently not being included in the estimates of 
deaths attributable to air pollution in GBD, leading to 
underestimation of the health impact of air pollution.46
We estimated that life expectancy in India would have 
been increased by 1·7 years if the pollution levels had 
been lower than the minimum levels associated with 
health loss, including 0·9 years for ambient particulate 
matter pollution reduction and 0·7 years for household 
air pollution reduction. This potential increase in life 
expectancy would have been highest in some of the large 
less­developed states in north India that have a high 
dual burden of ambient particulate matter and 
household air pollution. Our estimate of the impact of 
air pollution on life expectancy in India is lower than 
previous reports.34,35 One report, which applied a linear 
extrapolation of an estimate of life expectancy increase 
per unit decrease in PM2·5 from a US county­level study, 
estimated an impact of 3·4 years on life expectancy from 
ambient air pollu 
tion in India, including PM2·5 and 
ozone.34 Because the relationship between air pollution 
and mortality is steeper at lower levels of exposure, such 
as in the USA, linear extrapolations from these low 
PM2·5 concentrations to the higher concentrations in 
India would overestimate its impact.46,47 Another report 
using a life table approach similar to the one used in our 
study, but which used GBD 2016 air pollution findings, 
estimated an adverse impact of 1·5 years on life 
expectancy from ambient particulate matter pollution in 
India.35 Our lower estimates of the impact of ambient 
particulate matter pollution using GBD 2017 findings 
are probably related to the improvement in GBD 2017 
methods for estimating the impact of air pollution, 
which avoids the potential overestimation of disease 
burden in people exposed to both ambient particulate 
matter and household air pollution. This new method 
resulted in overall lower attribution of disease burden to 
air pollution in India than in GBD 2016. However, even 
with this reduced estimated impact, air pollution 
remains a leading risk factor for death and disease 
burden in India in 2017
. It is important to note that GBD 
has thus far attributed diseases to air pollution for which 
definitive evidence of causality is available, which has 
led to robust estimates for the diseases that have been 
included, but this also results in underestimation of the 
overall impact of air pollution because of non­inclusion 
of the diseases for which the evidence is emerging but 
not fully established yet.48
It is useful to note that although air pollution is 
commonly thought to be associated with lung disease, a 
substantial 38% of the disease burden due to air pollution 
in India is from cardiovascular disease and diabetes. 
Another notable aspect of air pollution in India is its 
contribution to the disease burden from ischaemic heart 
disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
and lung cancer, which are commonly associated with 
smoking. The DALYs for these diseases that are

attributable to air pollution at the population level in 
India are similar to those attributable to tobacco use. 
Policies aimed at tobacco use control in India seem to 
have resulted in a decline in smoking,27 which is a good 
public health achievement that needs to be sustained. 
Efforts to control air pollution are also needed in India to 
reduce the burden of these major non­communicable 
diseases.
Many studies from across the world, including some 
from India, have provided evidence for the association of 
air 
pollution 
with 
cardiovascular 
and 
lung 
diseases.1,8,37,38,46,49,50 Although a large proportion of this 
evidence is from settings more developed than India, 
evidence from studies of the health impact of short­term 
exposure to air pollution indicate similar responses in the 
Indian population with those in other countries.8,17 
Evidence from a cohort study in China, which included 
exposure at levels similar to those in India, reported 
cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and lung 
cancer mortality relative risks for PM2·5 that are similar to 
those estimated from studies in high­income countries.50 
Prospective cohort studies that have been initiated in 
India for studying the long­term health impact of air 
pollution on cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, 
and birth 
weight are expected to provide further evidence 
on this topic in India.14,51,52 In brief, the available evidence 
indicates that the relative risks for adverse health 
outcomes associated with exposure to air pollution from 
studies worldwide can be used to estimate the health loss 
from air pollution in India (appendix pp 16–20).
Control of ambient particulate matter pollution requires 
action in several sectors and the linkage of these actions 
for greatest impact. Several studies have estimated the 
contribution of various sources to particulate matter 
pollution in different parts of India,3–11 which can be useful 
in informing the efforts that are needed to address these 
sources. Several government initiatives have been 
launched in the past few years to reduce air pollution. 
These include a reduction in particulate matter emissions 
by coal power plants and reduction in energy consumption 
by energy­intensive industries (Ministry of Power), setting 
emission standards for the brick manufacturing industry 
and facilitating management of agricultural residues to 
reduce stubble burning (Ministry of Environment), stricter 
vehicle emissions regulation and upgrading of vehicles to 
more fuel­efficient standards (Ministry of Road Transport 
and Highways; and Ministry of Petroleum and Natural 
Gas), and enhancing availability of public transport 
(Ministry of Urban Development).19,20,53–55 Mechanisms that 
help to reduce air pollution should also be included in the 
Smart Cities Mission launched by the Government of 
India.56 About two­thirds of the electricity in India is 
produced from fossil fuels, mainly coal,57 but India has 
pledged in the Paris Climate Agreement to generate 40% 
of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030.58
State­specific policies such as use of compressed 
natural gas by vehicles in Delhi, subsidies for alternative 
technologies to compost agricultural waste instead of 
burning it in Punjab, and mandatory use of fly ash in the 
construction industry within 100 km from coal or lignite 
thermal plants in Maharashtra could be expanded to 
other states to efficiently control particulate matter 
emissions.8 Another initiative is the Clean Air for Delhi 
Campaign launched in early 2018, which subsequently 
led to the launch of the National Clean Air Programme 
that aims to sensitise the public and enhance coordination 
between the implementing agencies for control of air 
pollution across the country.22–24 Other initiatives such as 
the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions 
targets to reduce particulate matter emission intensity by 
33–35% by 2030, promotion of electric public transport 
fleets, and upgrading vehicles to Bharat Stage VI (which 
is equivalent to Euro­VI standard) vehicle emission 
standards, are also encouraging but will take some time 
before any substantial effect is seen.18,53,59 The very high 
ambient particulate matter pollution levels in north India 
in the winter season result in attention to this matter by 
the media and public with discussion often focusing on 
the acute health problems due to high pollution, whereas 
the much more important longer­term adverse health 
effects of chronically high pollution levels throughout the 
year have yet to be fully realised.60 More awareness needs 
to be created about the slow but substantial impact of 
ambient particulate matter and household air pollution 
among policy makers and the general public, which 
would help further enhance the air pollution control 
efforts in India.
Government initiatives to reduce solid fuel use for 
tackling household air pollution include a major scheme 
initiated by the Prime Minister of India in May, 
2016—the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana.21 This 
scheme had planned to provide clean and safe cooking 
fuel (liquefied petroleum gas) to 50 million low­income 
households by March, 2019, by adding 10 000 more 
distributors, increasing access, and covering nearly all 
the upfront costs of switching for low­income 
households. Encouragingly, the original target of 
50 million households was met in August, 2018, and the 
government has now increased the target to reach 
80 million households through this scheme with a total 
budget of US$1·8 billion.61 Liquefied petroleum gas 
meets the International Standards Organization and 
WHO recommendations, and can potentially help in 
achieving the WHO air quality standards within homes, 
but adoption and sustained use of clean fuels by 
households will be needed.62,63 Income, education, and 
urban location have been shown to be associated with 
the adoption of cleaner stoves and fuels, and better 
understanding of the role of uninterrupted fuel 
availability and prices as well as household size, 
composition, and gender roles in decision making can 
help to achieve sustained use.64 Targeted and innovative 
subsidies for liquefied petroleum gas appear necessary 
to increase and sustain the use of clean cooking fuels,

and have the potential to transform the associated ex­
penditures into social investments.63,65,66 Furthermore, 
several studies report residential biomass use­related 
emissions to be one of the largest contributors to 
population­weighted ambient PM2·5 concentrations.8,67,68 
In densely populated communities, it has also been 
shown that health­relevant reductions in household air 
pollution 
are 
best 
accomplished 
when 
entire 
communities transition to clean fuels.69 This provides 
additional justification for initiatives such as smokeless 
villages in the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana.21
According to the WHO database of air pollution, 14 of 
the 15 cities with the worst air pollution in the world are in 
India.70 The experience in controlling air pollution in 
Mexico City and Beijing could be instructive for dealing 
with the extremely high pollution levels in New Delhi and 
other cities of India. Mexico and China have been making 
long­term efforts to switch to cleaner energy options, 
improve the application of emission­controlling tech­
nologies, promote public transport systems, promulgate 
policies to reduce total energy consumption, and promote 
environmental education and research, which attempt 
to address all major sources of air pollution through 
coordinated air quality management.71–74
The general limitations associated with GBD methods 
for risk factors estimates were published previously.36 
Specifically for India, the relatively low number of PM2·5 
ground monitoring stations across the country, with none 
in rural areas, is a key limitation, which will be crucial to 
address for both air quality management and research. 
The expansion of automatic continuous ambient air 
quality monitoring stations across India in the past 
few years,75 and the proposal in the National Clean Air 
Programme to set up rural monitoring stations and 
increase the number of monitoring stations measuring 
PM2·5 across the country,23 are likely to strengthen the air 
pollution estimates in India. The scarcity of data on ozone 
exposure in India needs to be addressed as well. Another 
important area that needs strengthening is the generation 
of more evidence on the association of air pollution with 
health loss in India. Long­term cohort studies reporting 
adverse health effects of air pollution in India are scarce, 
although some are underway and expected to provide 
useful evidence in future; however, more are needed to 
strengthen this evidence. The strengths of the findings 
presented in this report include a comprehensive 
assessment of air pollution exposure in every state of India 
and the associated health loss using all accessible data 
from multiple sources, the improved GBD 2017 methods 
for assessing the health impact of air pollution, assessment 
of the impact of air pollution as part of a single GBD 
framework that includes all risk factors and diseases, and 
the substantial inputs to the analysis and interpretation of 
findings by a network of environmental risk factors experts 
in India.
In conclusion, these findings not only highlight the 
serious adverse health impact that is being caused by air 
pollution across India, but also bring into focus the large 
variations between the states in the exposure to air 
pollution and the associated health loss. The state­level 
findings presented in this report can serve as a useful 
guide to plan further interventions specific for the 
situation in each state. India should implement both 
short­term and long­term comprehensive policies and 
mechanisms to reduce the high levels of air pollution 
that pose a major threat to the long­term development of 
India. En 
couragingly, the discussion on air pollution in 
India by the media, public, and other stakeholders has 
been increasing substantially and policy makers seem 
keen to address the problem.22,76–78 This positive mo­
mentum could be boosted further by the state­specific 
evidence presented in this report to enhance the planning 
and implementation of air pollution control efforts 
across India in a sustainable manner. It is important to 
note that besides benefitting human health, the reduction 
of air pollution in India would also have a broader 
beneficial impact on other aspects of the ecosystem, 
including animal and plant health.
