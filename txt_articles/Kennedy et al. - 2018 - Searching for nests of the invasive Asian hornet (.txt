Asian hornets (Vespa velutina) are voracious predators of bees, and are the latest emerging
threat to managed and wild pollinator populations in Europe. To prevent establishment or
reduce the rate of spread of V. velutina, early detection and destruction of nests is considered
the only option. Detection is difficult as their nests are well hidden and flying hornets are
difficult to follow over long distances. We address this challenge by tracking individual
V. velutina workers flying back to their nests using radio telemetry for the first time, finding
five previously undiscovered nests, up to 1.33 km from hornet release points. Hornets can fly
with 0.28 g tags if the tag:hornet ratio is less than 0.8. This method offers a step-change in
options to tackle the spread of this invader, providing an efficient means of finding V. velutina
nests in complex environments to manage this emerging threat to pollinators.

 T
he Asian hornet or yellow-legged hornet (Vespa velutina
nigrithorax Lepeletier) is an invasive alien species1, 2 that
poses an immediate and substantial threat to European
pollinators3, 4. Originating from Asia, it was first recorded in
Europe in 20055, introduced via trade through south-western
France in or before 20046. It has spread across France, into
northern Spain, Portugal, Italy, Germany, Mallorca Island, the
Channel Islands7, 8 and was recorded for the first time on the UK
mainland in September 20169. The invasion front on the Eur-
opean continent is estimated to have spread at approx. 60–78 km
per year10, 11, with occasional nests reported 200 km ahead of the
front
suggesting
accidental
human-mediated
transport
of
founding queens4. This is likely to have consequences not only for
beekeeping and honey production, but also for crop and wild
flower pollination. The hornets live in large eusocial colonies
producing up to 15,000 individuals over the colony’s lifetime and
several hundred gynes in autumn10. They are voracious predators
of insects, showing a preference for Hymenoptera including
honeybees, wild bees and wasps12, 13. The foragers hawk at the
entrance of honeybee hives, snatching and killing returning
honeybee foragers14. The bee colony responds by shutting down
foraging effort so the colony is not only weakened by levels of
predation but may starve from lack of food15, 16. To date there
has been no scientific evaluation of the overall impact of
V. velutina on honeybee colony survival but, in France, bee-
keepers estimate that they have lost between 5 and 80% of hon-
eybee colonies (average 30%) where V. velutina has established3.
This is similar to the scale of losses resulting from the spread of
Varroa destructor mites across Europe in the 1990s17. Of addi-
tional concern is that V. velutina preys on wild insects, and the
level of damage to pollinator populations and pollination services
could be extensive but is so far unquantified4. The speed of
establishment11, 18 indicates that the only means of containing or
curtailing the spread is to locate and destroy colonies at the
invasion front as early in the season as possible, before repro-
ductives (gynes and males) are produced3, 19.
There is thus an urgent need to develop a method to locate
V. velutina nests quickly and efficiently so that they can be
destroyed if required. Most nest recovery currently depends on
visual searches with limited efficiency18 since V. velutina nests are
well hidden, often positioned high in trees or in dense scrub, and
often in urban areas10, 20. The most effective visual search method
involves recording the ‘vanishing direction’ in which hornets fly
away from foraging sites, and then homing in on the V. velutina
nest by setting bait traps in a series of steps closing in on the
source—a method that can take days and several people (R.
Hogge, Jersey, personal communication). Harmonic radar, used
successfully to track individual flying bees over hundreds of
metres21, 22, is unsuitable for V. velutina because it relies on
tracking in open, flat landscapes, as vegetation obscures the sig-
nal. Milanesio et al.23, 24 have developed another harmonic radar
system, bespoke for V. velutina, with a wider beam width. It is
able to identify preferred flight directions of returning hornets but
signal strength and range are constrained in wooded and urban
environments, and the equipment’s mobility is restricted by its
size. No successful nest searches have been reported to date.
Thermal cameras mounted on drones are currently being tes-
ted25, but may only be useful in the vicinity of the nest (<100 m).
We considered using the hand-held RECCO™ radar system that
has been used on insects such as beetles and dragonflies26–30. The
insect tags are light (0.03 g, since they are passive so do not
require a battery), but their range is less than 100 m, and can be as
short as 12 m (depending on tag orientation) (P. Kennedy,
unpublished data), limiting its likely use given that V. velutina
can fly over a kilometre from their nests on foraging trips9.
Radio-telemetry has been successfully used to track vertebrates
for over 50 years31, 32 but examples of its use for tracking flying
insects, reviewed by Kissling et al.29, are more limited owing to
how the weight (largely due to the battery) and antennal length of
even the smallest tags may still impede flight. The smallest tags
from Biotrack Ltd, UK, weigh 0.22 g (Pip19/Ag190 tag) and 0.28 g
(PicoPip/Ag337 tag), with antenna length of 10 cm, and a battery
life of 4–12 days. Despite their weight these tags do have
advantages over radar because they are individually traceable,
even in dense and complex environments (not relying on line-of-
sight), and detectable to a range of ~800 m for PicoPip/Ag337
tags, and ~375 m for Pip19/Ag190 tags. They are commercially
available giving the opportunity to develop a technique useable by
a range of stakeholders and non-specialists to find V. velutina
nests to manage the risk of this invasive species. The technique of
using tagged individuals to find conspecifics, in species that are
known to aggregate into groups, has been termed the Judas
technique33. This technique has been employed against mam-
mals34, birds35 and fish36, but only recently against an insect pest
(the Coconut rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes thinonceros)37 and here
for the first time to our knowledge against a social insect.
Since V. velutina workers are robust fliers weighing approxi-
mately 0.140–0.475 g and are adapted to carry large prey items10
we chose to test these radio tags to track flying hornets. For nest
detection we only require hornets to fly back to their nests and we
do not assume that hornets are flying without energetic penal-
ties29. So, here we demonstrate that V. velutina workers can be
individually tracked using radio telemetry to find their nests in
complex environments, using a new method of attaching some of
the smallest individually identifiable radio tags available29. This
represents a major step forward in developing contingency plans
to manage this emerging threat to pollinators. It is also a
breakthrough for investigating the hornet’s ecology in greater
detail, opening up the possibility of developing further pest
management options.
Results
Vespa velutina flight capability when carrying radio tags. Vespa
velutina workers were caught foraging at two field sites (South
West France and Jersey) and those selected for testing ranged in
weight from 0.229 to 0.490 g (Supplementary Table 1). We
designed a new method for attaching a radio tag (Pip19/Ag190 or
PicoPip/Ag337), or tag mimic (dummy; see Methods) to a
V. velutina worker. Unlike most other insect tracking studies
where
tags
are
attached
dorsally29
(although
not
for
dragonflies38, 39), the most successful method for attaching a
radio tag to V. velutina was to attach it ventrally (without using
glue, tied with a cotton thread loop across the petiole) (Fig. 1a, b,
Supplementary Fig 1). In this configuration the hornet could both
walk and fly following tag attachment. No hornets flew well with
dorsal tag attachment. Importantly, the hornets were not laun-
ched immediately into flight but were given 10–20 min to adjust
to the presence of the tag.
After 10–20 min adjustment, we tested whether each hornet
could fly with the tag in place, both inside an insect-proof
outdoor flight cage and freely outside the cage to confirm whether
observation of flight performance within the cage was an
indicator of successful free flight. Of the 36 tagged hornets
assessed both in the cage and field, 17 flew well in the cage and all
of these flew well in the field (Table 1). Poor flyers in the cage
were usually also poor flyers in the field (12 out of 19), although
seven hornets flew poorly in the cage but went on to fly well
outside. There was thus a highly significant association between
flight performance in the cage and outside (Fishers exact test:
two-tailed P = 0.0000452). So successful flight in the cage, after
tag attachment, can be used as an indicator that the tagged hornet

 is likely to fly well when released, thus reducing the chances of
failed tracking attempts, and loss of tags.
For each V. velutina worker, we recorded how tag:hornet
weight ratio correlated with flight capability. The range of tags
tested weighed 0.195–0.494 g. The heaviest tag with which a
hornet flew well was 0.334 g (dummy tag, Fig. 2a). Most hornets
(81%) carrying tags less than 80% of their body weight flew well,
but above this threshold good flight was only observed for 14% of
hornets (Fig. 2b). These results show that ensuring a tag:hornet
ratio less than 0.8 is likely to result in successful tracking. Since
large workers (>0.35 g) could fly with the PicoPip/Ag337 tag
(0.28 g), and because of this tag’s longer detection range (up to
800 m) than the Pip19/Ag190, we focussed on using the larger tag
to test whether we could find V. velutina nests.
Radio-tracking foraging V. velutina back to their nests. Eight of
the V. velutina workers that were tagged with PicoPip/Ag377 tags
(Fig. 2a, b, Supplementary Table 2), and whose flight capability
was checked in the cage (tag:hornet weight <0.8), were released
near their point of capture and their flight activity tracked using a
Sika radio tracking receiver (Biotrack Ltd, UK) scanning for the
signal from the active tag. The tagged hornet was thus followed
on its flight path back to the nest. When lack of variation in signal
for 5–10 min suggested an individual had stopped, a visual
inspection was made to search for a potential nest, usually within
the leaf canopy of a tree, or for evidence of a foraging site.
Six V. velutina workers were tagged and released in France and
two in Jersey, and all were successfully tracked to between 45 m
and 1331 m from their release point. Five of these hornets were
tracked to their previously undiscovered nests (4 in France and 1
in Jersey: Fig. 3)—a 100% success rate of tracking and a 63%
success rate of nest detection. The nests found ranged from 195 to
1331 m (average = 529 m) from the tagged hornets’ release point
(where they had been originally foraging). For the three hornets
that were successfully tracked, but where no nest was detected,
this was not due to signal detection failure (Supplementary
Tables 2, 3): two hornets stopped in inaccessible places, and the
third hornet ceased to fly after it was caught in extensive heavy
rain and sought shelter overnight in a nearby tree.
Two hornets were tagged with the lighter Pip19/Ag190 tags but
flew away rapidly following release, and their radio signal was

Flight performance of hornets fitted with radio-telemetry tags, or hand-made mimics of such
tags, were judged first in a flight cage 3 m x 3 m x 2 m and subsequently on release in an open
field. Hornets demonstrating repeated horizontal flights or ascending flights after initial release
from an elevated position (1.3 m inside the field cage; 1.6 m in the field) were categorised as
good flyers. Hornets predominately demonstrating descending flights were categorised as poor
flyers. Analysed via two-by-two contingency table using Fisher’s exact test; two-tailed p value =

 subsequently lost soon after they were no longer visually
discernible. This tag was therefore not suitable when used by a
single tracking team, due to its limited range and the flight speed
of the tagged hornets.
In terms of effort required to find a nest, the average time spent
tracking a hornet from its release to nest detection was 92 ± 37
min (mean ± standard deviation) for two people, although it
would be feasible for one person to complete the task. Tagged
hornets actually flew at 2–4 m s−1, but search time includes
hornets stopping, and time taken for the tracking team to home
in on the signals. In France, four nests were found over 3 days.
Here the land-cover was predominately urban. It was thus not
feasible to follow the radio signals directly by compass direction,
but required the tracking team to follow roads and pathways,
triangulating on the signal. Nevertheless, the radio signal was
strong enough in this highly complex environment to find the
nests in trees at large distances from the hornet foraging site. The
nests were all found high in trees (above 5 m). In Jersey, the land-
cover was predominately farmland, but the hornet nest was found
in a tree in a private garden (Fig. 1d). The tagged hornets did not
necessarily go straight back to the nest after being released: five of
the hornets were tracked to foraging sites, feeding on ivy, willow
or mulberry, before returning to their nests. One hornet visited a
sweet chestnut tree (Castanea sativa), 625 m from its nest, on the
day after it had been tracked to its nest—demonstrating that the
tag attachment had not seriously compromised the insect’s ability
to fly.
One of the main advantages of this new radio-tracking
technique is speed and efficiency: In Jersey, in September and
October 2017, a team of 3–4 beekeepers/officials spent ~5 days
finding each V. velutina nest (they found 10) using vanishing
directions and visual searches. Our radio-tracking could take 1–2
people under 2–3 h, from hornet capture under optimum
conditions, to find each nest. Tracking thus only needs 25% of
the person resources, and importantly would be achieved in a
fraction of the time, giving the added advantage of earlier nest
destruction before reproductives emerge, reducing chances of
V. velutina spread the following year.
Discussion
Our study clearly demonstrates that radio-telemetry can be used
to successfully find V. velutina nests in complex, heterogeneous
environments. All the hornets tagged and released with 0.28 g
PicoPip/Ag377 tags were tracked successfully, resulting in the
discovery of five nests in urban (France) and farmed (Jersey)
landscapes. These nests were found within hours of locating and
capturing the foraging hornets; so this technique would make an
efficient and reliable tool to complement a contingency plan
focussed on detection and destruction of V. velutina nests at the
invasion front40. Having a method to detect V. velutina nests is
not only important for invasion management, but also enables
their ecology and behaviour to be examined in greater detail, at
different stages of the invasion timeline, so that the impact of this
species on wild and managed insects can be measured.
We have shown the opportunities and constraints of using this
technique. Vespa velutina workers weighing 0.356–0.475 g could
effectively fly with a 0.28 mg PicoPip/Ag377 tag, tied to the
petiole and positioned ventrally. Hornets could fly with tags
weighing up to 80% of their body weight. For the technique to be
successful it is best to choose the largest hornet workers possible,
avoiding those >0.500 g fresh weight (potentially gynes which are
unlikely to return to the nest)10, and give the hornets time to
recover from the attachment procedure in an environment in
which they can adapt their flight behaviour for at least 20 min
before they are released. The average weight of hornet workers
increases through the season as the colony develops, although
there is considerable variation between colonies and individuals
depending on resources, environment and latitude10. If the hor-
net workers are smaller (0.28–0.35 g), for example earlier in the
season, then 0.22 mg Pip19/Ag190 tags could be used. As these
lighter tags have a shorter detection range (<375 m), multiple
tracking teams (multiple receivers) may be required, but this is so
far untested. The use of the radio-telemetry may be limited by the
availability of large hornet workers in areas where the V. velutina
population is only recently established since the density of nests,
and consequently workers, will be low. On the other hand, only
one suitable hornet is required to find a nest.
Tackling V. velutina by early and efficient nest detection is the
best opportunity to halt or slow invasion in European countries
(such as the UK) where it is not yet well established. Govern-
ments and beekeepers across the EU are looking for methods to

 slow the spread of this pest species and scientists have docu-
mented the urgent need for research on early nest detection19, 41.
Nest density in Andernos-les-Bains, France, rose from zero to
12.3 km−2 within 10 years42 (although this included embryo nests
which subsequently may not have reached maturity) and, with no
control, Keeling et al.18 predict that there will be over 50,000 nests
across England and Wales within 10 years, reaching carrying
capacity in 20 years. So, while these predictions could be inter-
preted as a worst case scenario, they indicate that speed of action
is critical. We are at the beginning of the invasive process in the
UK and northern Europe so the opportunity to curtail the
invasion and limit impact is short9, 11. The costs of control and
management rise exponentially as an invasive species spreads17 so
there are clear benefits to early intervention, which will result in
long-term cost saving. While a full valuation requires further
data, we have estimated what our new nest detection protocol
would save in lost profits to beekeepers in the UK, using a similar
approach to that used for Varroa destructor mites17. Based on
there being ~250,000 managed UK honeybee colonies, worth ~
£600 per annum each to the UK economy in honey production
and crop pollination17, V. velutina establishment could result in
at least another 20–30% losses (on top of normal 10–15% annual
losses) costing the UK economy ~£30–45million. If the nest
detection protocol doubled the number of nests detected,
V. velutina nest density and honeybee colony losses could be
reduced by 30% 11, saving at least £10–£15 million in lost profits
to the UK each year. This does not include savings in beekeepers’
time to manage V. velutina attacks, the cost of beekeepers giving
up keeping bees in response to V. velutina, or the costs saved to
the authorities managing this pest as it spreads. The radio-
telemetry equipment itself would need to be purchased, at a
current 2018 cost for reciever and antenna of less than £2000 plus
approximately £140 per radio tag (subject to any additional tax,
currency conversion and delivery costs). The more immediate
benefits of finding nests reliably using radio-tracking is that it will
result in needing 10% of the person power, and nests will be
found in a fraction of the time taken for traditional visual sear-
ches, giving the added advantage of earlier V. velutina nest
destruction before reproductives disperse and establish nests the
following year. The figures are cautiously calculated, and do not
include the value of damage to wild pollinator populations, or the
indirect effects on crop pollination that may ensue.
The impact of V. velutina on wild pollinators is so far
unquantified, and losses are less recoverable than for honeybees
because wild species are not managed, so there is little chance of
mitigation. For this reason the potential ecological impact of
V. velutina, beyond the economic, should not be underestimated,
and this new method of tracking hornets to their nests should be

 rapidly incorporated in V. velutina invasion management plans
across Europe.
Methods
Study overview. The study was carried out on workers of Vespa velutina nigri-
thorax (also known as yellow-legged or Asian hornets), found foraging in SW
France and in Jersey. At the time of the study (July and September 2017)
V. velutina nests were building towards maturity with hundreds to thousands of
workers searching for insect prey to feed developing brood in their colonies. The
purpose of the technique developed was to find nests before reproductives (gynes
and males) were produced (typically between September and December10).
Field sites. Methods were developed and tested within the grounds of INRA
Bordeaux-Aquitaine, in the southern suburbs of Bordeaux (Villenave d’Ornon,
Gironde, southwestern France). Method development (cold anaesthesia, tag
attachment and recovery post-handling) took place from 17 to 24 July 2017; tests of
tagged hornet flight performance took place from 25 to 27 July and 13 to 21
September 2017. Tagged hornets were tracked in Villenave d’Ornon on 27 July and
between 13 and 21 September 2017 under warm, dry conditions (average daily
temperatures = min 10.4 °C, max 22.2 °C; average daily rainfall = 1.9 mm; average
wind speed = 3.5 m s−1). We also tested the technique on V. velutina in Jersey
(Crown Dependency of the UK, located 14 miles from the north west coast of
France), which has a much lower density of hornets as they have newly established
here8. Testing and tracking was carried out between 25 and 28 September 2017 at
the States of Jersey Department of Environment (Howard Davis Farm, La Route de
la Trinité, Trinity, Jersey JE3 5JP) and near to points of capture in and around the
Durrell Wildlife Park (Trinity) and New Zealand Avenue, St Saviour. These par-
ishes are predominately rural with some semi-urban development (average daily
temperature = min 13.8 °C, max 18.8 °C; average daily rainfall = 2.8 mm; average
wind speed = 4.2 m s−1).
Radio tags. The Pip19 (with Ag190 battery) and PicoPip (with Ag337 battery)
radio tags (both from Biotrack Ltd, UK) were deemed the most suitable as they
were among the lightest, smallest VHF tags available. They are sold in various
configurations differing in location of the battery relative to the tag electronic
circuit board and orientation of their aerial. Initial attempts utilised tags in Bio-
track’s Option A configuration (with batteries on top of circuit boards generating a
shorter, fatter tag: 8 mm long × 5 mm wide × 4 mm tall) but subsequently tags in
Biotrack’s Option C configuration (with battery fixed at the end the circuit board
generating a longer, slimmer tag: 13 mm long × 5 mm wide × 2 mm tall) were
preferred as these fitted better under the abdomen of a V. velutina worker. All tags
had a 100 mm aerial in the same plane as the length of the tag (hence trailing
behind it), although these could be shortened but with a loss in range in doing so.
Pip19/Ag190 tags weighed 0.222 g (SD ± 0.016 g; range = 0.195–0.245 g; includes a
small 7 mg metal loop glued to the tag for attachment as described below) and were
activated by cutting a connecting wire on the side of the tag. Once activated, Pip19
tags with a pulse length of 15 ms and pulse frequency of 28–32 ppm (pulses per
minute) had a manufacturer’s expected lifespan of 4 days. PicoPip/Ag337 tags
weighed 0.280 g (SD ± 0.012 g; range = 0.256–0.312 g; including the small 7 mg
metal attachment loop) and were activated by removal of a magnet linked to an
integral reed switch. Once activated, PicoPip tags with a pulse length of 19–20 ms
and a pulse rate of 39–46 ppm had a manufacturer’s expected lifespan of 12 days.
Reed switches come with a slight weight penalty but were preferred during testing
as such tags could be readily activated and deactivated when reusing tags on
different hornets (a factor less relevant to tracking as hornets were infrequently re-
caught following field release). Reed switches were not utilised with Pip19 tags as
the weight penalty was considered proportionally more substantial. Testing of
representative Pip19 and PicoPip tags in a flat open landscape (Predannack airfield,
Ruan Major, UK) indicated expected detection ranges of approx. 250 m (max. 375
m) and approx. 500 m (max. 817 m), respectively.
Each tag operated at a specific frequency within the band designated for wildlife
telemetry within that country (in France = 150.xxx MHz; in UK including Jersey =
173.xxx MHz). Tags of different frequencies were used to ensure activated tags
could be distinguished in the field. The frequencies were preprogrammed into a
Sika radio tracking receiver (138–174 MHz band width; Biotrack Ltd, UK), fine-
tuned to each individual tag, and signal detection confirmed with a suitable Yagi
antenna (Biotrack Ltd, UK) before release of a tagged individual.
To test the capabilities of hornets to carry tags of differing weights, we utilised
Pip19 and PicoPip tags (either active or with expired batteries) and further
expanded the weight range tested by utilising home-made mimics of such tags,
made from short lengths of electric mains core wrapped in insulating tape and with
a thin 100 mm aerial, to an equivalent size, shape and relevant weight.
All tags had a very small metal wire loop (resistant to bite action by the hornet)
glued on to front edge of the tag, allowing the tag and aerial to trail behind from
this attachment point (see below for attachment to hornet). As live tags were
encased by the manufacturer in either varnish or Plastidip, the tags were made not
only water resistant but avoided the attached wire loop short-circuiting the tag
electronics. Each tag was marked with either a unique identifier provided by the
manufacturer or by the addition of unique mark (e.g. numbered and coloured
honeybee queen marking disc glued to dummy tags). Before use, each tag was
weighed, with their metal wire attachment loop in place, on an electronic
laboratory balance.
Attachment of the radio tag. Vespa velutina hornets were caught in an insect net
while hawking outside beehives, foraging around a willow tree, or foraging at
artificial bait stations (prawn-baited in Bordeaux; Trappit® wasp attractant baited
in Jersey). Once caught, individual hornets were transferred via 50 ml Falcon
centrifuge tubes (with ventilation hole/slit in cap) to the laboratory where they were
weighed on an electronic laboratory balance. To avoid testing or tracking
V. velutina gynes, queens or males, female individuals weighing <0.500 g were
selected10. Selected individuals were cold anaesthetised by embedding the Falcon
tube, with hornet, to its full length in crushed ice for a minimum of 10 min or until
the hornet no longer showed discernible movement (max. 12 min). Once anaes-
thetised, a hornet would be secured to a bespoke restraining plate (Supplementary
Fig. 1). The abdomen of an anaesthetised hornet would be carefully manoeuvred
under the wire tie on the plate, ensuring wings and legs were free of entrapment,
before the wire ends were pulled tight, lowering the hoop, between abdomen and
thorax, across the hornet’s petiole. The 20 mm distance between drilled holes and
the stiffness of the wire ensured that the wire would restrain the hornet to the plate
without damaging it, even when the wire was pulled very tight. The wire ends were
secured by bending them over opposite edges of the restraining plate. Thin cotton
sowing thread was next fed though the head of the T-shaped cut in the restraining
plate, over the hornet’s petiole, and back down through the head of the T-shaped
cut in the restraining plate (avoiding legs, wings and wire tie). The thread was
drawn sufficiently tight and thread ends tied in a knot to produce a thread loop
around the petiole that was loose enough to allow free movement but close enough
to prevent a hornet from reaching and biting the thread loop. The remaining ends
of cotton thread were then passed though the small metal wire loop previously
attached to the radio tags and tied in a further tight knot. Knots were further
secured by a small dap of superglue, and surplus lengths of thread removed close to
the final knot. An anaesthetised V. velutina worker would partially recover within
the short time (<5 min) needed to attach a tag but would remain secure on the
restraining plate. To ensure subsequent identification of individuals, a unique
coloured and numbered honeybee queen marking disc was glued (Loctite Super
Glue Power Flex Gel Control) on to the dorsal surface of the thorax of each hornet.
The above tag arrangement and attachment permitted a radio tag to be secured
to a central ventral point of the hornet, with the attachment point beyond reach of
the hornet’s mandibles, but nevertheless allowing sufficient movement in the tag
enabling the hornet to manoeuvre past obstacles when on a surface. In flight, the
tag and aerial would trail below and slightly behind the hornet with little direct
impact on flight (earlier attempts at fitting tags to the dorsal side of the thorax
proved top-heavy and led to hornets flipping over and falling to ground;
unpublished data).
Once marked and tagged, a hornet was released into a ventilated recovery cage
(0.6 m x 0.6 m x 0.7 m) by loosening the wire tie and guiding the hornet and tag
along the T-shaped slit until free from the restraining plate and secured in the cage.
Hornets were given 10 min to recover from anaesthesia and handling within the
cage in which food (honey, fruit syrup and water) was provided ad libitum. This
recovery period also permitted released hornets to begin to adapt flight behaviour
to take account of the weight and size of attached tags. Ad hoc observations during
this period also permitted checks to confirm tags were attached in a manner
permitting the hornets to walk and fly within the confines of the cage.
Testing whether tagged V. velutina can fly. Flight performance of 47 tagged
hornets was assessed in an outdoor flight cage (3 m x 3 m x 2 m insect-proof and
pollination netted cage from Diatex SAS, France; ref. PE16/13.28), or on field
release near point of initial capture (37 hornets in both, 7 in the flight cage only,
and 3 on field release only; see Supplementary Table 1). For ease of release, the
recovery cage was placed inside the outdoor flight cage on a raised platform. On
completion of the recovery period, a selected hornet was placed on the roof of the
recovery cage and released to assess its flight performance over the subsequent 10
min. A released hornet would either walk or fly to the edge of the roof and launch
into the air towards the perimeter of the flight cage. From the approx. 1.3 m
vantage of the recovery cage roof, a hornet would descend to the ground, achieve
near horizontal flight, demonstrate slight ascending flights, or variants between
these. As well as an opportunity to assess flight performance, this period in the
flight cage was also a further opportunity for hornets to adapt to the presence of
radio tags. Hornets that landed on the ground were either guided towards the flight
cage netting to allow them to climb to a height, or lifted back on to the recovery
cage roof. Flight performance was assessed based on repeated flights or flight
attempts within the 10 min period, and rated on a scale of 1−5 (1 = sharp des-
cending flights only or no flights; 2 = mainly descending flights; 3 = both hor-
izontal and descending flights; 4 = mainly horizontal flights; 5 = ascending and
strong horizontal flights). On a conservative basis, hornets rated 4 or 5 were
subsequently categorised as good flyers and hornets rated 1 to 3 were categorised as
poor flyers within the flight cage.
On completion of the flight performance assessment in the flight cage, hornets
were transferred to an open field location. Using blunt forceps, a hornet would be
placed on a gloved hand held approx. 1.6 m above the ground. The hornet was

 allowed to fly off when ready or, if remained stationary for over 5 min, was gently
encouraged to depart by slight movement of the forceps near the hornet. A hornet
was permitted three attempts to fly beyond reach. If all three attempts were
descending towards the ground, the hornet was classified as a poor flyer and
recovered. If the hornet flew beyond reach (e.g. into a tree at >12 m from the
release site, or beyond a distance where it was visually discernible), it was
categorised a good flyer. Hornets that were fitted with active radio tags and
subsequently tracked were included in these flight assessments.
Tracking tagged V. velutina to their nests. Ten tagged V. velutina workers
prepared for tracking were transferred to a field location, close to where they had
been caught: seven hornets in France and three hornets in Jersey. Two hornets were
fitted with Pip19 tags and eight hornets with PicoPip tags. The functioning of the
active tags was verified by tuning the Sika radio tracking receiver to the pre-
programmed channel and checking for a detectable signal via Sika receiver with
Yagi antenna prior to release.
A V. velutina worker selected for release was placed on an elevated surface
(either the roof of a parked car or on a gloved hand; both approx. 1.6 m above the
ground). As previously during flight performance assessments, each hornet was
given no more than three attempts to fly from an elevated location. All ten
V. velutina workers flew either to a nearby tree or flew beyond a distance where
they were visually discernible. In all cases, the release time, GPS coordinates
(latitude and longitude) of the release site and vanishing direction (i.e. compass
bearing) from the release point were recorded. The visually determined vanishing
direction was also confirmed as the direction providing the strongest signal from
the tag attached to the released hornet.
The tracking team, made up of a Sika receiver operator and data recorder,
would quickly relocate along the vanishing direction, checking for the direction of
strongest signal reception. The tracking team was restricted to using public roads or
paths, municipal recreational areas, or land where prior permission to enter had
been sought. Consequently, the tracking team could not follow the hornets’ flight
paths directly but had to triangulate from accessible locations. Variation in the
detected signal’s strength or direction from a location would indicate whether a
tagged hornet was likely stationary or in flight. Although principally a direction
indicator, adjustment of the gain/sensitivity of the Sika receiver would indicate
whether a hornet was close, on occasions confirmed by visual sightings of a tagged
hornet. The time, signal direction and GPS coordinates of various waypoints along
a tracking route were recorded as well as any observational notes such as foraging
activity around nectar-rich food sources (e.g. flowering ivy covered trees). When
the detected signal was deduced to converge on a single location from various
waypoints over a period of 5–10 min, the location in question was visually checked
through binoculars looking for evidence of a nest (usually within the leaf canopy of
a tree), concentrated hornet traffic (suggesting a concealed nest) or the tagged
hornet, or else to determine whether it was a likely foraging site (evidenced by
abundant nectar-rich flowers such as ivy; and associated hornet activity). Such
searching continued until either observed or daylight faded. When a nest was
found, its location was recorded and the local hosts (INRA in France; and
Department of Environment in Jersey) informed to enable them to activate the
locally appropriate management plan and limit the impact of V. velutina.
Analysis. Each captured hornet was weighed and all behavioural information
recorded after tagging, through to the location of nests. For a range of tag weights
and hornet weights, the tag:hornet weight ratio was calculated to determine the
threshold relating to good flight performance (Fig. 2). Distances between release
point and nest location were calculated from the latitude and longitude of the two
points (Fig. 3). All data are included in the Supplementary Tables.
Statistical analysis. Flight performance was divided into two classes: poor and
good flyers, for tests both within the cage and outside. A Fisher’s exact test on the
two-by-two contingency table (Table 1) was used to test for association between
performances of individuals inside and outside the cage, to explore whether flight
within the cage was a good indicator of flight outside the cage.
Data availability. The authors declare that all data supporting the findings of this
study are available within the article and Supplementary Tables 1–3.
