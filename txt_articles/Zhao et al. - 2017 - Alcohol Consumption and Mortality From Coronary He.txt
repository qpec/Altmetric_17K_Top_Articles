ABSTRACT. Objective: Previous meta-analyses estimate that low-
volume alcohol consumption protects against coronary heart disease
(CHD). Potential errors in studies include systematic misclassifica-
tion of drinkers as abstainers, inadequate measurement, and selection
bias across the life course. Method: Prospective studies of alcohol
consumption and CHD mortality were identified in scholarly databases
and reference lists. Studies were coded for potential abstainer biases
and other study characteristics. The alcohol–CHD risk relationship was
estimated in mixed models with controls for potential biases. Stratified
analyses were performed based on variables identified as potential effect
modifiers. Results: Fully adjusted meta-analysis of all 45 studies found
significantly reduced CHD mortality for current low-volume drinkers
(relative risk [RR] = 0.80, 95% CI [0.69, 0.93]) and all current drinkers
(RR = 0.88, 95% CI [0.78, 0.99]). There was evidence of effect modi-
fication by cohort age, gender, ethnicity, and heart health at baseline.
In stratified analyses, low-volume consumption was not significantly
protective for cohorts ages 55 years or younger at baseline (RR = 0.95,
95% CI [0.75, 1.21]), for studies controlling for heart health (RR = 0.87,
95% CI [0.71, 1.06]), or for higher quality studies (RR = 0.86, 95% CI
[0.68, 1.09]). In studies in which the mean age was 55 years or younger
at baseline, there were significantly increased RRs for both former (RR
= 1.45, 95% CI [1.08, 1.95]) and occasional drinkers (RR = 1.44, 95%
CI [1.09, 1.89]) compared with abstainers. Conclusions: Pooled analysis
of all identified studies suggested an association between alcohol use
and reduced CHD risk. However, this association was not observed in
studies of those age 55 years or younger at baseline, in higher quality
studies, or in studies that controlled for heart health. The appearance of
cardio-protection among older people may reflect systematic selection
biases that accumulate over the life course. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs, 78,

C
ORONARY HEART DISEASE (CHD) is the most com-
mon type of heart disease and was the leading cause of
death globally in 2010, accounting for more than 7 million,
or 13.3%, of all deaths (Lozano et al., 2012). CHD affects
individuals of all ages, men more so than women (Finegold
et al., 2013). Risk factors include older age, sex, family his-
tory, diabetes, high cholesterol, tobacco smoking, hyperten-
sion, obesity, lack of exercise, and stress (Andréasson, 1998).
The evidence for alcohol use as a risk factor for CHD, how-
ever, is complex. Most systematic reviews find associations
between low-volume alcohol consumption and reduced CHD
risk, whereas some also find increased CHD risk for higher
levels of consumption (Corrao et al., 2000; Maclure, 1993;
Roerecke & Rehm, 2012; Ronksley et al., 2011).
The meta-analysis of observational longitudinal studies
by Ronksley et al. (2011) found that alcohol consumption
was associated with reduced risk of CHD incidence and
mortality. A companion article by Brien et al. (2011) re-
ported meta-analyses of the effects of low-volume alcohol on
biomarkers indicating risk of coronary disease, finding that 4
of 13 known biomarkers were positively influenced in short-
term experimental studies. They argued that the main criteria
for causation in epidemiology (Hill, 1965) were therefore
met and that consideration should be given to encouraging
patients to drink alcohol medicinally, a view shared by some
physicians.
More recently, however, evidence has accumulated to sug-
gest that the case for cardioprotection may be less straight-
forward. One biomarker (HDL) identified by Brien et al.
(2011) as influenced by low-volume alcohol has since been
questioned as a genuine risk factor for cardiovascular disease
(CVD). There are also two other CVD biomarkers that have
 376
JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS / MAY 2017
been shown to be adversely affected by low-volume alcohol
use (Juonala et al., 2009; Pletcher et al., 2005), and it has
been long known that blood pressure is raised in a dose-
response fashion by alcohol use (McFadden et al., 2005). A
recent Mendelian randomization study found that a genetic
marker associated with reduced consumption was also as-
sociated with reduced risk of CVD among generally low-
volume drinkers but not abstainers (Holmes et al., 2014).
An opposite finding would be expected if moderate drinking
affords cardioprotection.
In relation to the literature on observational longitudinal
studies of alcohol and health, these have also been ques-
tioned on multiple grounds (Chikritzhs et al., 2009; Stock-
well & Chikritzhs, 2013). For example, protective effects
have been observed in numerous conditions other than CHD,
including many for which a causal role seems implausible
(e.g., asthma, the common cold, deafness, osteoporosis,
arthritis, liver cirrhosis, and child neurocognition/behavior;
Fekjaer, 2013; Liang & Chikritzhs, 2012). Thus, the Brad-
ford–Hill criterion of effect “specificity” is not met, which
raises the possibility that “moderate drinking” may be a
marker for a range of protective lifestyle factors that may
confound observed alcohol–CVD relationships.
Supporting such an interpretation, Naimi et al. (2005)
found that abstainers tended to score worse on a wide range
of social and behavioral risk factors for CVD than low-
volume drinkers. There is also a range of possible problems
with the choice of reference group often loosely defined as
abstainers in these studies. It is well established that former
drinkers have significantly higher morbidity and mortality
risk than lifetime abstainers; however, they are frequently
included in the abstainer reference group (Stockwell et
al., 2016). Even lifetime abstainers may be biased toward
ill health including from young ages (Ng Fat & Shelton,
2012), therefore making drinking groups appear healthy by
comparison.
Some have argued that occasional drinkers alone should
be the reference group because they are more normative and
may be less biased toward ill health (Shaper, 1995). Others
have argued that occasional drinkers may include many
individuals who have cut down on their drinking for health
reasons (Fillmore et al., 2006; Shaper, 1995) or that the sta-
tus of occasional drinkers may vary by gender (Stockwell et
al., 2007). In a recent meta-analysis of alcohol and all-cause
mortality, we reported that people consuming less than one
drink per week had the same degree of apparent protection
from premature mortality as did moderate drinkers (Stock-
well et al., 2016). However, such an occasional consumption
pattern is unlikely to confer physiological benefits, which
suggests that the apparent protection from moderate drinking
may also not be real.
Another major critique of the cardioprotection hypothesis
is that disease-specific longitudinal studies (e.g., CVD/CHD
mortality) fail to take into account competing risks from
other alcohol-related causes of death across the life course
(Stockwell & Chikritzhs, 2013; Stockwell et al., 2016),
resulting in a “healthy survivor” bias, particularly among
drinkers enrolled in cohorts at relatively older ages. The
idea is that selection biases accumulate over time such that
cohort studies initiated among older people (or containing
older individuals) will exclude moderate drinkers who have
become ill or died from other alcohol-related conditions oc-
curring earlier in life (e.g., injury, some cancers) (Naimi et
al., 2017).
Bergmann et al. (2013) used this interpretation of their
finding in a large cohort study that cardioprotection was only
observed for low-volume drinkers if previously ill individu-
als were excluded from the analysis. These lines of research
suggest that cohorts recruited later in life will evidence more
pronounced cardioprotection both because lifetime selec-
tion biases will have accumulated and other alcohol-related
competing risks (e.g., for cancers) will have eliminated low-
volume drinkers who might otherwise have been at elevated
risk for heart disease.
In the present study, an updated meta-analysis of alco-
hol use and CHD mortality risk (Fillmore et al., 2006) is
reported in which the influence of some of the above meth-
odological problems is explored—in particular, problems
with misclassification of drinkers as abstainers; the extent
to which studies have controlled for other lifestyle CHD
risk factors, cohort age, sex, ethnicity; whether previously
ill individuals were excluded in selected studies; and qual-
ity measure of alcohol consumption used in studies. It was
hypothesized that controlling for abstainer misclassification
biases (both occasional and former drinker biases), cohort
age, and other potential study-level confounders would re-
duce the extent of protection associated with light to moder-
ate alcohol intake. Roerecke and Rehm’s systematic review
(2012) reported significant heterogeneity across studies that
estimated effects of alcohol consumption on CHD risk. We
sought to explore the source of this heterogeneity though
stratified analyses using variables identified as potential ef-
fect modifiers.
Method
Full details of the methodology can be found in Appendix
A and are presented more briefly below.
Study searches
A systematic review following PRISMA (Preferred Re-
porting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses)
guidelines (Moher et al., 2009) identified original prospec-
tive studies quantifying the association between alcohol
consumption and CHD mortality. The electronic databases
PubMed and Web of Science were systematically searched
up to June 30, 2016, to capture the most recent litera-
 ZHAO ET AL.

FIGURE 1.
Flowchart of systematic reviews of all-cause and coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality and alcohol consumption studies for meta-analysis
ture and include all published studies. Reference lists of
articles meeting the eligibility criteria were screened for
additional potential relevant articles that might have been
missed by our electronic searches. We did searches for
both all-cause and CHD mortality studies but conducted
meta-analyses on alcohol use and all-cause and CHD mor-
tality, separately.
Study selection
Included studies were original cohort studies published
in English, with mortality from CHD outcomes and at least
three levels of alcohol consumption quantified for human
subjects of all ages. Forty-five studies satisfied the criteria
for the meta-analysis on CHD mortality and alcohol use
(Figure 1) and are presented in Supplemental Table A1 in
Appendix A.
Data extraction
Data extracted were (a) outcome, CHD mortality; (b)
measures of alcohol consumption; and (c) study characteris-
tics including types of abstainer misclassification error and
controlled variables in individual studies.

JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS / MAY 2017
Outcomes
The outcome variable of interest was defined as the pres-
ence or absence of mortality from CHD in individual studies
(ICD-10: I20–I25; World Health Organization, 2010). Haz-
ard ratio and rate ratio estimates of mortality due to alcohol
use in individual studies were used as the relative risk (RR)
estimates.
Measures of alcohol consumption
The primary exposure variable was level of daily alcohol
use in grams of ethanol assessed at baseline and compared
with a reference group of variously defined “nondrinkers.”
Covariates
Covariates included in meta-regression were the pres-
ence of former and/or occasional drinker biases, mean age
of cohort at baseline, gender of study population, primarily
White ethnicity of study population or not, alcohol measure
accuracy, and whether studies controlled for social status,
smoking status, and indication of prior heart problems. Stud-
ies were classified on the presence or absence of abstainer
biases by whether (a) abstainers included both occasional
drinkers and former drinkers, (b) abstainers included occa-
sional drinkers only, (c) abstainers included former drinkers
only, and (d) abstainers included neither occasional drinkers
nor former drinkers.
Data analysis
Mixed-effects regression analyses were performed in which
drinking groups and control variables were treated as fixed
effects with a random study effect (Normand, 1999). The
dependent variable was the natural log of the RR.All analyses
were weighted by the inverse of the estimated variance of the
natural log-RR.All statistical analyses were performed using
SAS Version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
Publication bias was assessed through visual inspection of
the funnel plot of log-RR of CHD mortality due to alcohol
consumption against the inverse standard error of log-RR
(Woodward, 2000) and Egger’
s linear regression method (Eg-
ger et al., 1997). We plotted forest graphs of log-RR of CHD
mortality for any level of drinking (all current and former),
current low-volume drinking, and all current drinking to
assess heterogeneity across studies (Lewis & Clarke, 2001).
We also assessed between-study heterogeneity of RRs using
Cochran’s Q (Cochran, 1954) and the I2 statistic (Higgins &
Thompson, 2002). Because of the presence of heterogeneity,
mixed-effects models were used to obtain the summarized
RR estimates.
Drinking categories were defined and reclassified as (a)
former drinkers now completely abstaining; (b) current oc-
casional drinkers, defined as up to one drink per week (<1.30
g per day); (c) current low-volume drinkers, up to two drinks
or 1.30–24.99 g per day; (d) current medium-volume drink-
ers, up to four drinks or 25–44.99 g per day; (e) current
high-volume drinkers, up to six drinks or 45–64.99 g per
day; and (f) current higher volume drinkers, six drinks or 65
g or more per day. Covariates were selected for inclusion on
empirical grounds based on p values of bivariate tests of the
log-RR and each covariate and on the absence of significant
correlations with other variables.
We also performed stratified analyses on subgroups of
studies where there was an indication of possible effect mod-
ification. We present analyses of studies stratified by gender,
mean age, and ethnicity and control for heart health in order
to explore variation in the effects of alcohol use on CHD
mortality according to different values of these variables.
A meta-analysis was also performed based on higher
quality studies that included studies with absence of former
drinker bias, control for smoking status, and follow-up to a
mean cohort age of 60 years to allow for possibility of CHD
mortality.
Studies with large or small estimates and/or variance can
be highly influential. Sensitivity analyses were run after ex-
cluding such studies, but no substantial changes in the risk
estimates were seen (Woodward, 2000). Sensitivity analysis
was also performed by inclusion or exclusion of outliers of
log-RR (Acuna & Rodrigues, 2014; Pagano & Gauvreau,
2000; Woodward, 2000) to identify outliers. There were no
marked changes in the risk estimates regardless of whether
these “outliers” were excluded or included; therefore, all
observations including those assessed to be outliers were
included in the analyses we present here.
Results
Characteristics of included studies
The 45 unique studies selected included 269 estimates
of the risk relationship between level of alcohol consump-
tion and CHD mortality (Figure 1), more than in previously
published meta-analyses. There were 2,913,140 subjects
and 65,476 deaths available for the analysis. In addition to
newly published studies, we included several older studies
omitted from previous meta-analyses (Corrao et al., 2000;
Maclure, 1993; Roerecke & Rehm, 2012; Ronksley et al.,
2011), even though similar criteria were used to select stud-
ies (Supplemental Table A2 in Appendix A). An additional
nine published studies that met our selection criteria for the
study have been included since the last meta-analysis was
published (Roerecke & Rehm, 2012).
Among the 45 studies, 17 reported RR estimates for men
and women separately, 21 for men only, 2 for women only,
and 5 for both sexes combined (Supplemental Table A1 in
Appendix A). Only 7 studies (53 risk estimates) were free
from abstainer bias, i.e., had a reference group of strictly
 ZHAO ET AL.
379
defined lifetime abstainers. Twenty-five studies (132 risk es-
timates) had both former and occasional drinker bias, 8 stud-
ies (41 risk estimates) had only former drinker bias, and 5
studies (43 risk estimates) had only occasional drinker bias.
Five studies were conducted in Asian countries (3 in China,
2 in Japan) and 40 in countries with mainly White popula-
tions (22 in the United States, 18 in Australia or European
countries).
A funnel plot of the log-RR estimates and their inverse
standard errors was made to visually inspect for publication
bias (Supplemental Figure B1 in Appendix B). The plot
was reasonably symmetrical with no indication of publica-
tion bias. Egger’s linear regression (Supplemental Table B1
in Appendix B) also did not suggest any publication bias
overall or in any drinking groups (all t test ps > .05). There
was significant heterogeneity observed across studies (t test
p < .05) for all drinking categories confirmed by both the Q
statistic and I2 estimates (all above 38%).
Estimates of coronary heart disease mortality risk for
drinkers from meta-analysis of pooled studies
Unadjusted mean RR estimates in the pooled 269 risk
estimates showed a significantly higher risk among former
drinkers (RR = 1.25, t test p = .0215 in Table 1) and a sig-
nificantly lower risk among low-, medium-, and high-volume
drinkers (RR = 0.79, 0.86, and 0.85, respectively, t test p
< .05) compared with abstainers. Weighted RR estimates
adjusted for between-study variation showed that the effects
changed slightly. In the fully adjusted model with further ad-
justments for all variables found to be potential confounders,
RR estimates remained almost unchanged.
The study-to-study differences summarized by forest plots
show the adjusted RR estimates of CHD mortality (adjusted
for sampling variability and between-study variation) for
all drinkers versus abstainers (Figure 2) and all current and
current low-volume drinkers (Supplemental Figures B2 and
B3 in Appendix B) versus abstainers. As these forest plots
show, most RR estimates fell on the left-hand side of the
graph, which tells us that mean effect sizes were mostly
lower, whereas a few studies showed a significantly increased
effect of alcohol use.
We tested for potential effect modification of covariates
first in mixed models with no other covariates and by strati-
fied analyses for covariates. Tests for interactions (Drinking
Category × Covariate) in mixed models suggested that the
effects of alcohol consumption on CHD mortality varied
by sex (interaction term: F value = 2.65 and p = .0240) and
cohort age (interaction term: F value = 3.17 and p = .0088)
but not by ethnicity and whether studies controlled for heart
health at baseline (interaction term: F = 1.19 and p = .32,
F = 1.66 and 0.14, respectively). Second, we looked for the
differences in CHD risk by between-study characteristics
across all drinking subgroups, and these are presented in Ap-
pendix C (Supplemental Tables C1 and C2). These indicated
significant or borderline significant effect modification for
gender, cohort age, adequacy of drinking measure, ethnicity,
and whether studies controlled for heart health at baseline
for some drinking categories. Weighted mean RR estimates
for all drinkers combined adjusted for between-study varia-
tion showed a significantly lower risk of CHD mortality for
almost all subgroups but not for studies conducted in Japan
or China, those in which smoking was not controlled for, or
for studies with no more than one type of abstainer bias.
The analyses also showed a significantly lower risk of
CHD mortality associated with both all current drinking
and former and current low-volume drinking for studies in
which results for both sexes were combined compared with
those with results presented separately for men (t test p =
.013) and women (t test p = .007). We present analyses of
studies stratified by gender, mean age, and whether studies
controlled for heart health or not in the main text and, be-

Estimates of coronary heart disease mortality risk for
drinkers by gender
Table 2 presents mean estimates of CHD mortality risk
by level of alcohol intake by gender. These indicated signifi-
cantly decreased risk of CHD mortality among male drinkers
who drank 1.3–44.99 g per day (RR = 0.86/0.84, t test p <
.05) and female drinkers who drank 1.3–24.99 g per day (RR
= 0.81, t test p < .05) compared with abstainers and after full
adjustment for potentially confounding study level covari-
ates and abstainer misclassification errors. However, fully
adjusted RRs were significantly higher among both male
former (RR = 1.37, t test p < .01) and marginally higher
among male occasional drinkers (RR = 1.24, t test p = .0526)
but not for women.

Estimates of coronary heart disease mortality risk on the
basis of mean age of study population
RR estimates for drinkers were estimated in analyses
stratified by lower or higher mean age of the study popula-
tions at baseline (Table 3). In studies with subjects whose
mean age was 55 years or younger (all of which were
conducted among White populations), fully adjusted mod-
els showed nonsignificant increased RRs for all drinkers
(RR = 1.17, t test p > .05) and all current drinkers (RR
= 1.12, t test p > .05). There were significantly increased
RRs for former (RR = 1.45, t test p < .05) and occasional
(RR = 1.44, t test p < .05) drinkers. The RR estimates
showed slightly decreased, nonsignificant risk for low-
volume drinkers (RR = 0.95, t test p > .05) and slightly
increased but nonsignificant risk for medium- and high-
volume drinkers (RR = 1.04 and 1.07, respectively, t test
p > .05), and the estimates for higher volume drinkers in-
creased but were not significant (RR = 1.15, t test p > .05).
Controlling for former and occasional drinker biases and
for smoking and social status in individual studies mark-
edly affected the RR estimates. The fully adjusted models
for the studies with mean age older than age 55 years at
baseline in Table 3 showed significantly increased RRs for
former drinkers (RR = 1.34, t test p < .01) and decreased
RRs for low (RR = 0.81, t test p < .01), medium (RR =
0.77, t test p < .01), and all current drinkers (RR = 0.83, t
test p < .01).
Figure 3 presents the changes in the mortality risk esti-
mates for low-volume drinkers after removal of influential
covariates from the fully adjusted model one at a time. The
figure shows that study level control for abstainer bias vari-
able was the most influential, followed by study level control
for smoking status variable, control for adequacy of drinking
measure, and for heart health at baseline.
Estimates of coronary heart disease mortality risk stratified
by control for heart health at baseline
RR estimates for drinkers were estimated in analyses
stratified by whether studies had excluded subjects with
heart conditions at baseline or otherwise controlled for
baseline heart health in the analyses (Table 4). In studies
with some kind of control for baseline heart health, fully
adjusted models showed no significantly increased RRs for
current occasional drinkers (RR = 1.16, t test p > .05) and
current higher volume drinkers (RR = 1.11, t test p > .05)
and significantly increased RR for former drinkers (RR =
1.39, t test p < .05) but no significantly reduced risk for
current low-volume drinkers (RR = 0.87, t test p > .05) or
any other category of current drinker. By contrast, fully ad-
justed models for the studies that did not control for heart
health showed significantly decreased RRs for current low
volume (RR = 0.78, t test p < .001), medium volume (RR
= 0.76, t test p < .001), high volume (RR = 0.84, t test p <
.05), and all current drinkers (RR = 0.83, t test p < .01).
Estimates of coronary heart disease mortality risk based
on higher quality studies
Following methods we used in our earlier study of all-
cause mortality, we established a subset of studies that met
 382
JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS / MAY 2017
several higher quality criteria. Because of the limited number
of such studies, we dropped the requirement of there being
no occasional drinker bias, because this left only two stud-
ies. We also loosened the requirement for mean age at intake
from up to 55 to up to 60 years. This permitted analyses of
five higher quality studies that (a) were free from former
drinker bias, (b) controlled for smoking status, (c) had a
mean age of up to 60 years at intake, (d) were followed up
to a mean age of at least 55 years, and (e) had an adequate
measure of alcohol consumption. As shown in Table 5, nei-
ther partially nor fully adjusted estimates indicated signifi-
cantly decreased risk of CHD for low- and medium-volume

drinkers, although the estimated RRs for all current drinkers
were less than unity.
Estimates of coronary heart disease mortality risk for
drinkers by ethnicity
Weighted RR estimates for low-volume drinkers adjusted
for between-study variation suggested a potential differ-
ence in CHD risk between mostly White and mostly Asian
populations (Supplemental Table C1 in Appendix C). The
RR estimates are presented in Supplemental Table C3 in
Appendix C for models stratified by main ethnicity. Fully
adjusted models showed a significantly increased risk among
former drinkers (RR = 1.28, t test p < .01) and decreased
risk among low- (RR = 0.81, t test p < .01) and medium-
volume drinkers (RR = 0.83, t test p < .01) compared with
abstainers in the White populations. In Asian populations,
the RR estimates were similar to the White populations but
were not significant, perhaps because of the small sample of
available studies.
Discussion
In this study, the role of study-level covariates including
abstainer biases in studies of alcohol use and CHD mortality
was explored in aggregate and by demographic subgroups
using meta-analysis of published prospective cohort studies.
Pooled meta-regression analyses of all 45 selected studies,
with adjustments for between-study variation, abstainer bias,
and other study-level covariates, indicated significantly lower
CHD risks for low- and medium-volume drinkers compared
with abstainers. Investigation of this relationship among pop-
ulation subgroups stratified by gender, age, prior coronary
health, and ethnicity also indicated substantial heterogeneity
in the pattern of results and raised questions about underly-
ing effects of unmeasured bias and confounding variables.
Unlike some previous meta-analysts (Corrao et al., 2000), we
did not find a significant association between heavier alcohol
use and increased CHD risk in most analyses.
Consistent with previous analyses (Roerecke & Rehm,
2012; Ronksley et al., 2011), it was confirmed that former
drinkers have a significantly increased CHD risk compared
with lifetime abstainers, especially among men. Analyses by
mean age of the study populations and by dominant ethnicity
(i.e., mainly White or Asian) also showed a significantly in-
creased risk for former drinkers among both those age 55 or
younger and those older than 55, and for White populations.
There may have been too few available studies to confirm a
similar pattern of results for Asian populations. These results
confirm that former drinkers should not be included in the
abstainer reference group because this will artificially sup-
press CHD risk estimates for all current drinkers. The great
majority of the 45 studies contained some form of abstainer
bias, and attempts to control for these at the study level are
at best crude.
Our findings also confirmed the importance of exclud-
ing occasional drinkers from the abstainer reference group.
Among the few studies with separate results for occasional

drinkers (n = 5), markedly elevated CHD risk (RR = 1.24,
p = .0526) was observed in comparison with abstainers, a
result confirmed separately for men but not women. Thus,
the common practice of including occasional drinkers in the
abstainer reference group (29 of 45 studies here) will also
lead to underestimation of health risks in all drinking groups,
as suggested by Fillmore et al. (2006).
Evidence of some effect modification was found for mean
age of cohorts at baseline, gender, ethnicity, adequacy of
drinking measure, and whether heart health was controlled
for in studies either statistically or by exclusion of people
with heart disease from analysis. Hence, to explore this ob-
served heterogeneity, we reported further models stratified by
gender, mean age of cohort at baseline, dominant ethnicity,
and whether those with poor heart health at baseline were
excluded or this characteristic was controlled for in analyses.
In each case, interesting contrasts were observed.
First, in analyses stratified by gender, both former and
occasional biases and protective effects for low/moderate
drinking were more likely to be observed for men than for
women. Second, a marked contrast was observed in the pat-
terns of results for cohorts recruited with a mean age of no
more than 55 years compared with those whose mean age
was over 55 years at baseline. This was despite both groups
being followed up to ages at which CHD was possible: The
23 studies with younger cohorts were followed up to mean
ages of between 53 and 89 years.
The finding of no significant protection for the younger
cohort but substantial observed protection against CHD for
the older cohort is of great interest. As outlined by Naimi et
al. (2017), a broad range of selection factors and competing
risks operate across the life course that influence who gets to
be included in such a cohort study and who is still identified
as an active current drinker. With increasing age and frailty,
people will cut down or quit their drinking and often be in-
correctly classified as abstainers; they are also more likely to
be excluded from epidemiological studies on health grounds.
It is also possible that they have already died before cohort
inception; among drinkers, some of this premature mortality
could have been due to alcohol itself. Such factors can serve
to bias observations so that the abstainer reference group
comprises increasingly unhealthy individuals, leaving the
surviving drinkers as selected for good health.
Influence of another possibly biasing factor identified was
whether heart health at baseline was controlled for. Studies
with such controls found no evidence of significant protec-
tion against CHD from any level of alcohol consumption,
whereas there was marked protection observed among stud-
ies that did not control for heart health at baseline. This is
an opposite finding to Bergmann et al. (2013) in their large
prospective cohort study and deserves further investigation.
Although there was a significantly elevated CHD risk ob-
served for heavier alcohol consumers in unadjusted analyses,
this was no longer significant after adjustment for potential
abstainer biases.
Finally, when the studies were stratified by dominant
ethnicity, there was no evidence of protective effects from
drinking among the small number of studies with mainly
Asian populations. There was, by contrast, significantly
reduced CHD risk observed for those who drank 1.3–44.99
g per day among the studies with mainly White populations.
However, we note that the 23 studies of younger cohorts (up
to 55 years of age at baseline) were all studies using mainly
White populations that, again, found no evidence of CHD
protection from alcohol use.
There are some notable caveats regarding these observed
patterns of results. We have reported a systematic review and
meta-analyses of observational studies linking self-reported
alcohol consumption with risk of later CHD mortality. Not
only is self-reported alcohol consumption substantially
underreported (Zhao et al., 2015), but how people describe
their drinking levels varies over time (Rehm et al., 2008).
Our analyses, however, were restricted to single estimates of
drinking level self-reported at one point in time, which does
not capture patterns across the life course. There were only
a handful of studies free from abstainer biases, and even
these mostly suffered from poor measurement of mean daily
alcohol consumption. The analyses presented in Appendix C
 ZHAO ET AL.

suggest that studies with adequate measures (those canvass-
ing a period of at least 1 week and assessing both quantity
and frequency of consumption) had much higher estimates
of drinking risk than those with inadequate measures. This
severely limits the capacity to thoroughly explore the impact
of drinker misclassification and other sources of selection
bias and confounding factors.
Furthermore, we were not able to take into account all
potential criticisms of the evidence for the existence of car-
dioprotection from low- and medium-volume drinking. We
could not control for the possibility that lifetime abstainers
themselves have compromised health and hence are not an
ideal reference group as suggested in some studies (Ng Fat
& Shelton, 2012), nor were we able to control for differen-
tial and competing risks across the life course for different
disease outcomes. In addition, some estimates, such as those
for Asian populations and heavier drinkers, were unstable
because of small number of observations.
Further, we have not incorporated the recommendation
from Liang & Chikritzhs (2013) that former drinkers should
be classified according to their previous drinking level, not
as abstainers, so as to create a less biased estimate of the
risk relationship between level of alcohol use and CHD risk
and to more closely approximate intention-to-treat analyses
typically used in randomized trials. This idea was pursued
in a basic way by including former drinkers along with all
other current drinkers in models comparing CHD risk for
all lifetime drinkers versus abstainers. In most cases, this
resulted in CHD RRs greater than unity for this combined
group of past and present drinkers that, for younger cohorts
of mostly White drinkers, was of borderline significance (RR
= 1.17, t test p = .06). Another shortcoming was the dearth
of studies that have assessed drinking pattern as opposed to
average daily intake, especially since Roerecke and Rehm
(2011) have demonstrated reduced or absent CHD protection
for binge drinkers.
Our major conclusion is that the hypothesis that low-
volume alcohol use can confer cardio-protection cannot
be confirmed, because there remain plausible alternative
explanations for the observed findings (Figure 3). First,
there are substantial methodological problems with many of
the studies comprising this observational literature, which
is inherently open to unmeasured sources of bias and con-
founding (Naimi et al., 2017). More specifically, 38 of the 45
identified studies contained either former and/or occasional
drinker biases, and 16 used inadequate measures of typical
daily alcohol consumption. The results confirmed the im-
portance of separating former and occasional drinkers from
the abstainer reference group as both these groups displayed
significantly elevated CHD mortality risk, especially for
men.
In other stratified analysis, no cardio-protection was ob-
served for predominantly Asian populations or for studies of
White populations recruited at an age of up to 55 years. The
observation of marked CHD protection effects for drinkers
only for older cohorts can be understood as reflecting the
accumulation of lifetime selection biases, which result in
highly selected continuing drinkers being compared with in-
creasingly unhealthy current abstainers (Naimi et al., 2017).
We conclude that there remain grounds for skepticism
about the hypothesis that alcohol use can be cardio-protec-
tive, and we recommend that future prospective studies not
only avoid biased abstainer reference groups but also take
steps to minimize other forms of selection bias across the
life course, including that from competing disease risks. We
also recommend that level of former drinking is considered
and that, following Liang & Chikritzhs (2013), both former
and current drinkers are combined when estimating the ef-
fects of all levels and patterns of alcohol consumption on
health.
