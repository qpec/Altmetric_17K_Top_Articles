Abstract
The tumor suppressor complex BRCA1-BARD1 functions in DNA double-strand break repair by 
homologous recombination. Therein, BRCA1-BARD1 facilitates the nucleolytic resection of DNA 
ends to generate a single-stranded template for the recruitment of another tumor suppressor 
complex BRCA2-PALB2 and the recombinase RAD51. By examining purified BRCA1-BARD1 
and mutants, we show that BRCA1 and BARD1 both bind DNA and interact with RAD51, and

 that BRCA1-BARD1 enhances the recombinase activity of RAD51. Mechanistically, BRCA1-
BARD1 promotes the assembly of the synaptic complex, an essential intermediate in RAD51-
mediated DNA joint formation. Evidence is provided that BRCA1 and BARD1 are both 
indispensable for RAD51 stimulation. Importantly, BRCA1-BARD1 mutants weakened for 
RAD51 interaction are compromised for DNA joint formation and for the mediation of 
homologous recombination and DNA repair in cells. Our results identify a late role of BRCA1-
BARD1 in homologous recombination, a novel attribute of the tumor suppressor complex that 
could be targeted in cancer therapy.
Mutations in BRCA1 (breast cancer susceptibility gene 1) are linked to familial breast and 
ovarian cancers, and also to Fanconi anemia (FA)1–5. Following its discovery over twenty 
years ago6–8, BRCA1 has been implicated in various biological processes including mRNA 
splicing and microRNA biogenesis9–13, DNA damage signaling/cell cycle checkpoints2,14, 
the avoidance of replication-transcription conflicts15,16, and DNA doublestrand break (DSB) 
repair by homologous recombination (HR)1,3,17–19. The role of BRCA1 in these processes 
has remained mostly undefined, largely because of difficulties in obtaining high quality 
protein preparations for biochemical analyses. BRCA1 (1,863 residues) forms a stable 
complex with BARD1 (BRCA1-associated RING domain protein 1; 777 residues)20,21. 
Depletion of BARD1 engenders DNA damage sensitivity, HR deficiency, and genome 
destabilization21–25. The ablation of BARD1 in mice leads to cancer susceptibility22, and 
probable disease causative mutations are found in cancer patients26–30.
We strive to delineate the multifaceted role of BRCA1-BARD1 in HR-mediated DSB repair. 
During the repair process, the DSB ends are resected to yield 3′ single-stranded DNA 
tails31. These DNA tails become coated by Replication Protein A (RPA), which is 
subsequently displaced by the recombinase protein RAD51 to form a nucleoprotein complex 
termed the presynaptic filament. The presynaptic filament searches for, engages, and then 
invades a homologous duplex target to form a nascent heteroduplex DNA joint, the 
displacement loop or D-loop. This is followed by DNA synthesis and resolution of DNA 
intermediates to complete repair32. Published work has suggested that BRCA1 promotes 
DNA end resection by acting as an antagonist of 53BP1 and regulating the MRE11-RAD50-
NBS1-CtIP complex, and also participates in RAD51 presynaptic filament formation with 
the tumor suppressors BRCA2 and PALB24,33. To gain mechanistic insights into how 
BRCA1-BARD1 promotes HR, we have developed a robust system for co-expressing 
BRCA1 and BARD1 in insect cells and a protocol to obtain BRCA1-BARD1 for 
biochemical testing. Our results reveal novel attributes of BRCA1-BARD1 and a previously 
unrecognized role of this protein complex in the DNA strand invasion step of HR-mediated 
chromosome damage repair.
DNA binding by BRCA1 and BARD1
BRCA1-BARD1 was expressed in insect cells and purified to near homogeneity (Extended 
Data Fig. 1a–d). We employed the DNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to test 
BRCA1-BARD1 for binding radiolabeled ssDNA, dsDNA, replication fork (RF), the D-
loop, and DNA bubble. We also performed competition experiments in which the

 nucleoprotein complex of BRCA1-BARD1 and radiolabeled D-loop was challenged with an 
unlabeled DNA species. The results revealed that BRCA1-BARD1 has the highest affinity 
for the D-loop and DNA bubble, followed by the RF, dsDNA, and ssDNA (Fig. 1a, b and 
Extended Data Figs. 1e–h; 2a,b).
BRCA1 is known to bind DNA34,35. Using the Southwestern assay, we found that both 
BRCA1 and BARD1 bind the D-loop, with BARD1 showing an apparently higher affinity 
for the substrate (Fig. 1c). Consistent with this, BRCA1-BARD11-142, which harbors full-
length BRCA1 and only the RING domain of BARD1, exhibited a lower affinity for various 
DNA substrates (Extended Data Fig. 1i, j). Taken together, our results showed that both 
BRCA1 and BARD1 contribute to the DNA binding capability of the BRCA1-BARD1 
complex. The DNA binding domain of BRCA1 was previously found to reside within the 
protein’s middle region34,35 and our mapping effort has led to the isolation of the BARD1 
DNA binding domain (Extended Data Fig. 2c–e). Importantly, the BARD1 domain exhibited 
similar DNA binding properties as the complex (Extended Data Fig. 2f–i). Thus, BARD1 is 
a structure-specific DNA binding protein with the highest affinity for the D-loop and DNA 
bubble.
RAD51 interaction by BRCA1 and BARD1
BRCA1 was found to co-immunoprecipitate with RAD51 from cell extracts17, but it has 
remained unclear whether it associates with RAD51 directly. By affinity pull-down, we 
found that BRCA1-BARD1 interacts with human RAD51 but has little or no affinity for 
yeast Rad51 (yRad51) (Fig. 1d) or E. coli RecA (Extended Data Fig. 3a). We also 
determined that 4–5 RAD51 molecules are bound by BRCA1-BARD1 (Extended Data Fig. 
3b,c). Notably, formation of the BRCA1-BARD1-RAD51 complex was not affected by 
benzonase or ethidium bromide (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 3d), indicating that the 
association is not bridged by nucleic acid. Surprisingly, both BRCA1 and BARD1 retained 
RAD51 in the Far Western assay, with BARD1 showing a more robust signal (Fig. 1e), 
while the HR factors RAD51D-XRCC2 and DSS1 did not bind RAD51 under the same 
conditions (Extended Data Fig. 3e). These results helped establish that BRCA1-BARD1 
associates with RAD51 in a species-specific manner, and that both proteins in the complex 
participate in RAD51 interaction.
Enhancement of homologous DNA pairing by BRCA1-BARD1
Given that BRCA1-BARD1 binds DNA and interacts with RAD51 (Fig. 1), we hypothesized 
that either it would enhance the assembly of the presynaptic filament and/or the potential of 
the presynaptic filament to mediate DNA strand invasion. We employed the DNA strand 
exchange assay36,37 (Extended Data Fig. 4a) to test whether BRCA1-BARD1 would 
facilitate RAD51 presynaptic filament assembly. The results revealed that, while, as reported 
previously36,38, the BRCA2-DSS1 complex promotes RAD51 presynaptic filament 
assembly on RPA-coated ssDNA, BRCA1-BARD1 does not possess such an attribute 
(Extended Data Fig. 4b, c). Moreover, we found that, unlike BRCA2-DSS137,38, BRCA1-
BARD1 is devoid of the ability to target RAD51 to ssDNA when dsDNA is present 
(Extended Data Fig. 4d–f).

 Next, the D-loop assay was conducted to test BRCA1-BARD1 for the promotion of DNA 
strand invasion (Fig. 2a). Importantly, BRCA1-BARD1, in amounts substoichiometric to 
RAD51, strongly enhanced the reaction, regardless of whether ATP (Extended Data Fig. 4g–
i) or the non-hydrolyzable analogue AMP-PNP (Fig. 2a–c) was used as the nucleotide 
cofactor, while BRCA2-DSS1 did not show any stimulation (Fig. 2a–c). In contrast, 
BRCA1-BARD1 did not enhance the activity of yRad51 (Extended Data Fig. 4j, k). We 
found no stimulatory effect of BRCA2-DSS1 on D-loop formation by BRCA1-BARD1-
RAD51 when the ssDNA substrate was pre-incubated with RAD51 or when ssDNA and 
plasmid DNA were premixed (Extended Data Fig. 5a, b). However, with RPA-coated 
ssDNA, D-loop formation became more robust with the combination of BRCA1-BARD1 
and BRCA2-DSS1 than either complex alone (Extended Data Fig. 5c, d). Taken together, the 
results revealed an unexpected role of BRCA1-BARD1 in promoting DNA joint formation 
that is catalyzed by RAD51 (Fig. 2d).
In homologous DNA pairing, the presynaptic filament captures the duplex partner and then 
assembles the synaptic complex in which the recombining DNA molecules are aligned in 
homologous registry and base switching has occurred32. By monitoring the protection of 
dsDNA against restriction enzyme digestion (Fig. 3a), we found a stimulatory effect of 
BRCA1-BARD1 on synaptic complex formation (Fig. 3b, c). Next, we employed our DNA 
curtain assay39,40 to examine the pairing of homologous DNA sequences in real time (Fig. 
3d). As reported previously39,40, the RAD51 presynaptic filament was able to engage a 70-
bp dsDNA fragment harboring 9-nt homology (Fig. 3e). Importantly, the results showed an 
enhancement of DNA engagement by BRCA1-BARD1 (Fig. 3e). However, we found no 
evidence of BRCA1-BARD1 having any effect on the binding site distributions, the pairwise 
distance distributions, and the resident time (koff) of the bound dsDNA (Fig. 3f, g and 
Extended Data Fig. 5e). Since BRCA1-BARD1 does not affect the koff of the aligned 
dsDNA, we speculate that it acts by increasing the kon of dsDNA engagement. We note that 
BRCA1-BARD1 mutants impaired for BARD1-RAD51 interaction or lacking the RAD51 
interaction domain of BRCA1 are unable to promote pairing with the duplex target (see 
later). We also verified that BRCA1-BARD1 does not affect the ability of presynaptic 
filaments harboring yRad51 to engage dsDNA (Extended Data Fig. 5f and Fig. 3e).
Functional relevance of BARD1-RAD51 interaction
We sought to isolate RAD51-binding defective mutants of BRCA1-BARD1 for biochemical 
and genetic testing. First, we co-expressed RAD51 with various BRCA1 fragments in insect 
cells and conducted co-immunoprecipitation. Consistent with a previous study17, 
BRCA11-1527 could interact with RAD51, while BRCA11-1000 and BRCA11-500 were 
impaired in this regard (Extended Data Fig. 6a–c). Importantly, BRCA1-BARD1 could co-
precipitate much more RAD51 than BRCA1 alone. This result, together with the Far 
Western data (Fig. 1e), indicated that BARD1 harbors a major RAD51 interaction domain 
(Fig. 4a). Based on deletion analysis, the region between residues 123–162 of BARD1 was 
found to be indispensable for RAD51 interaction (Fig. 4a, b and Extended Data Fig.6d–g). 
Moreover, a GST-tagged BARD1 fragment harboring these residues could efficiently 
associate with RAD51 (Extended Data Fig. 6h), indicating that it encompasses the RAD51 
interaction domain. We also discovered that the core domain of RAD51 (referred to as T3),

 which has been implicated in BRCA2 binding via the BRC4 repeat of the latter41, is able to 
interact with BRCA1-BARD1 (Extended Data Fig. 3f), but not with BRCA1-BARD11-142 or 
BRCA11-500-BARD1 (Extended Data Fig. 3g). Interestingly, we found that BRCA1-BARD1 
can compete with BRCA2-DSS1 for RAD51 association (Extended Data Fig. 3h).
We expressed and purified the mutant BRCA1-BARD1Δ123–162 complex that is deleted for 
the RAD51 interaction domain in BARD1. We found that BRCA1-BARD1Δ123-162, while 
retaining normal DNA binding activity (Extended Data Fig. 7a, b), is defective in RAD51 
interaction (Fig. 4c) and, accordingly, fails to enhance D-loop formation (Fig. 4d, e) or 
synaptic complex assembly (Extended Data Fig. 7c, d). Sequence alignment of the RAD51 
interaction domain in BARD1 orthologs revealed a number of conserved amino acid 
residues (including the FXDA motif; Fig. 4b). Based on this information, we generated a 
compound mutant that changes the conserved residues F133 and D135 to alanine and A136 
to glutamic acid (the AAE mutant); F133 was included as other RAD51 interaction 
motifs41–43, such as BRC4 in BRCA241, also harbor a functionally indispensable F residue. 
We expressed and purified the mutant BRCA1-BARD1AAE complex. Biochemical testing 
revealed that, even though the mutant complex binds DNA normally (Extended Data Fig. 7a, 
b), it is impaired not only for RAD51 association (Fig. 4c), but also for the ability to 
stimulate D-loop formation and synaptic complex assembly (Fig. 4d, e; Extended Data Figs. 
5g and 7c, d). Together, these results provided evidence that the BRCA1-BARD1-RAD51 
complex is indispensable for the enhancement of RAD51-mediated DNA strand invasion.
Cancer-associated mutations within the RAD51 interaction domain have been identified in 
BARD1, and one such mutation (K140N), found in two patients with colorectal 
adenocarcinoma or uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, alters the conserved residue K140 
(cBioPortal for Cancer Genomic)44,45 next to the FXDA motif (Fig. 4b). To determine the 
significance of this mutation, the BRCA1-BARD1K140N mutant complex was expressed and 
purified for testing. Importantly, the results revealed that, while the mutation has no impact 
on DNA binding (Extended Data Fig. 7a, b), it attenuates the affinity of BRCA1-BARD1 for 
RAD51 (Fig. 4c) and also compromises the ability of the tumor suppressor complex to 
enhance D-loop formation and synaptic complex assembly (Fig. 4d, e and Extended Data 
Fig. 7c, d).
Cellular role of the BRCA1-BARD1-RAD51 complex
Cell-based studies were conducted to examine the association between BRCA1-BARD1 and 
RAD51 and to ascertain the significance of the BRCA1-BARD1-RAD51 complex. We 
found that the amount of RAD51 co-immunoprecipitating with BARD1WTres is enhanced 
by MMC treatment of cells (Fig. 5a) and, importantly, that the BARD1AAEres mutation 
impairs the DNA damage-induced association with RAD51 (Fig. 5a). Cellular fractionation 
confirmed that the nuclear localization of BRCA1 and BARD1 is not affected by the 
BARD1AAEres mutation (Extended Data Fig. 8a).
Next, we employed the DR-GFP reporter46,47 and the CRISPR/Cas9-stimulated gene 
targeting assay48,49 to ask whether the BARD1AAEres mutation affects HR proficiency. As 
expected, knockdown of endogenous BRCA1 or BARD1 by siRNA impaired HR in both

 systems (Extended Data Fig. 8b–d). Importantly, while the ectopic expression of 
BARD1WTres in BARD1 deficient cells fully restored HR proficiency, that of 
BARD1AAEres resulted in only partial complementation (Fig. 5b, c and Extended Data Fig. 
9a, b). Moreover, in clonogenic cell survival assays, BARD1 deficient cells that harbored 
BARD1AAEres were markedly more sensitive to MMC and to the PARP inhibitor Olaparib 
than cells expressing BARD1WTres (Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig. 9c).
We also investigated whether the BARD1AAEres mutation would affect the DNA damage-
induced assembly of RAD51 nuclear foci. As expected, knockdown of endogenous BRCA1 
diminished RAD51 focus formation, either spontaneously or after γ-ray exposure (Extended 
Data Fig. 8e–g). Interestingly, treatment with BARD1 siRNA impaired RAD51 focus 
formation to a lesser extent (Extended Data Fig. 8g). In cells depleted of endogenous 
BARD1 and expressing BARD1WTres or BARD1AAEres, RAD51 focus formation occurred 
similarly, both spontaneously and after γ-irradiation (Extended Data Fig. 9d, e). However, as 
indicated by S4/S8 phosphorylation of RPA32, BARD1AAEres cells retained a much higher 
level of DNA damage 72 h after release from MMC treatment (Extended Data Fig. 9f). 
These results showed that HR repair is deficient in BARD1AAEres cells even though RAD51 
focus formation is not affected. Interestingly, even though depletion of 53BP1, an inhibitor 
of DNA end resection50, partially overcame the HR defect associated with BRCA1 
deficiency (Extended Data Fig. 8h, i), it did not suppress the HR defect in BARD1 deficient 
cells (Extended Data Fig. 8j, k). In cells lacking both BARD1 and 53BP1, BARD1AAEres 
was less capable than BARD1WTres in complementing the HR deficiency (Extended Data 
Fig. 8l, m). Taken together, our results helped establish the biological significance of the 
BRCA1-BARD1-RAD51 complex in DNA damage repair via HR and provide cellular 
evidence for a role of BRCA1-BARD1 in the DNA strand invasion step of HR.
Role of BRCA1 in RAD51-mediated homologous DNA pairing
For interrogating the role of BRCA1 in RAD51-mediated reactions, we expressed and 
purified BRCA11-500-BARD1, which lacks the RAD51 interaction and DNA binding 
domains of BRCA117,34, and also BRCA1Δ758-1064-BARD1, which is deleted for the 
RAD51 interaction domain of BRCA1. These mutant complexes appeared to be proficient in 
DNA binding (Extended Data Fig. 10a–e) but were weakened for RAD51 interaction 
(Extended Data Fig. 10f–h). Importantly, neither mutant complex could strongly enhance 
RAD51-mediated D-loop formation (Extended Data Fig. 10i, j) or synaptic complex 
assembly (Extended Data Figs. 5g and 7c–f). Thus, BRCA1 is also indispensable for the 
functional integrity of BRCA1-BARD1 as a co-factor of RAD51.
Discussion
Our study has revealed a novel role of BRCA1-BARD1 in the enhancement of DNA 
invasion in HR via a direct interaction with RAD51 (Fig. 6). Mechanistically, BRCA1-
BARD1 functions with the RAD51 presynaptic filament in the assembly of the synaptic 
complex, a critical precursor to D-loop formation (Fig. 6). Both BRCA1 and BARD1 are 
indispensable for this attribute. It is likely that physical association with RAD51 facilitates 
dsDNA engagement by the presynaptic filament and that the specific recognition of

 unwound DNA by BRCA1-BARD1 enhances the formation of the nascent DNA joint in the 
D-loop reaction. Since we have not observed significant stimulation by BRCA1-BARD1 of 
DNA strand exchange between an oligonucleotide and a short linear duplex, it remains 
possible that the complex facilitates DNA homology search within a long duplex DNA 
target. A model incorporating this new function and the known roles of BRCA1-BARD1 in 
DNA end resection and RAD51 presynaptic filament assembly is shown in Figure 6.
The findings from our study open up a new avenue towards understanding how mutations in 
BRCA1-BARD1 affect its DNA damage repair and tumor suppression functions. Indeed, we 
have provided evidence that the cancer-associated mutation K140N in BARD1 compromises 
the physical and functional interactions of BRCA1-BARD1 with RAD51. We note that the 
region of BRCA1 (amino acid residues 758-1064) that harbors the RAD51 interaction 
domain17 is frequently mutated in cancer (cBioPortal for Cancer Genomic)44,45 and that 
deletion of this domain abolishes the activity of BRCA1-BARD1 in RAD51-mediated DNA 
strand invasion (this study). The biochemical systems established in our work should be 
valuable for determining the impact of pathogenic mutations on BRCA1-BARD1 functions. 
Moreover, our findings may guide the development of targeted therapy of breast, ovarian, 
and other cancers.
Methods
Construction of plasmids
A His6 affinity tag was fused to BARD1 in pFastbac-BARD1 (from Jeffrey Parvin) using the 
QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mammalian pS-Flag-SBP-BARD1res 
expression vector was modified by removing the GFP coding sequence from the pS-Flag-
SBP-BARD1 vector (from Xiaochun Yu) and introducing silent mutations into the siRNA 
target regions of BARD1 using oligos 1 & 2 and oligos 3 & 4, respectively (see Extended 
Data Table 1). QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis was used to construct the mutant 
forms of BARD1, namely, BARD11-122, BARD11-162, BARD11-261, BARD1Δ123-162, 
BARD1Δ123-261, BARD1Δ163-261, BARD1AAE and BARD1K140N (The sequences of the 
primers used are available upon request). BARD1123-162 was introduced into pDEST15 for 
expression of the GST-tagged form of this BARD1 fragment in E. coli. BARD1124-270 was 
cloned into pE-SUMO vector (LifeSensors Inc.) for expression of the SUMO-tagged form of 
this BARD1 domain in E. coli.
Protein purification
Purification of BRCA1-BARD1 from insect cells—pFastbac-Flag-BRCA1 (from 
Jeffrey Parvin) and pFastbac-His-BARD1 were introduced into E. coli strain DH10Bac for 
bacmid generation. The bacmids were used to transfect SF9 insect cells to generate 
recombinant baculoviruses. After amplification in SF9 cells, the viruses were used to infect 
Hi5 insect cells for expression of BRCA1 and BARD1 (10 ml BRCA1 and 10 ml BARD1 
P3 viruses for 600 ml culture). After a 44-h incubation at 27°C, cells were harvested by 
centrifugation, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. All purification steps were 
carried out at 0°C to 4°C. To prepare extract, the frozen cell pellet (8 g, from 600 ml culture) 
was thawed and suspended in 40 ml of cell breakage buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500

following protease inhibitors: aprotinin, chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A at 3 μg/ml 
each, and 1 mM PMSF) for cell lysis using a Dounce homogenizer type B pestle (30 
strokes). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the 
supernatant was incubated with 3 ml anti-Flag M2 affinity resin (Sigma) for 2 h. The resin 
was transferred to a column (1.5 × 15 cm), washed with 50 ml lysis buffer and then with 50 
ml buffer B (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.01% 
Igepal CA-630, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mM MgCl2 and 2 mM ATP), before the bound 
proteins were eluted four times with 2 ml of buffer B containing the single Flag peptide (200 
μg/ml). The eluates were combined and mixed with 32 ml buffer C (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 
7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.01% Igepal CA-630, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) before 
being further fractionated in a 1 ml HiTrap SP Sepharose HP column (GE Healthcare) using 
a 12 ml gradient of 75–500 mM KCl in buffer C. The pooled BRCA1-BARD1 fractions 
(from 250–350 mM KCl) were further fractionated in a gel filtration column of Superose 6 
10/300 GL (GE Healthcare), which was developed with 24 ml of buffer C containing 300 
mM KCl. The peak fractions were pooled, divided into 10 μl portions, frozen in liquid 
nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. The mutant forms of BRCA1-BARD1 were expressed and 
purified using the same procedures. The yield of highly purified BRCA1-BARD1 from 600 
ml insect cell culture ranged from 150 to 300 μg with a final concentration of 300 to 500 
μg /ml.
Purification of BARD1123-162 andBARD1124-270 from E. coli—The GST-
BARD1123-162 expression plasmid pDEST15-BARD1123-162 or the BARD1124-270 
expression plasmid pET-SUMO-BARD1124-270 was introduced into E. coli Rosetta (DE3) 
cells. An overnight culture derived from a single colony in 50 ml LB medium grown at 37°C 
was used to inoculate 2 L fresh LB medium. IPTG was added to 0.4 mM when the cell 
density had reached OD600=0.8, and cells were harvested after a 16-h incubation at 16°C. 
All the subsequent steps were carried out at 0–4°C. The cell pellet (8 g) was suspended in 50 
ml buffer D (20 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.01% Igepal CA-630, 
1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 300 mM KCl) containing the protease inhibitors (aprotinin, 
chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A at 3 μg/ml each, and 1 mM PMSF) and cell lysate 
was prepared by sonication. After centrifugation (100,000 × g for 90 min), the clarified 
lysate was incubated with 2 ml Glutathione Sepharose 4 Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare; for 
GST-BARD1123-162) or Ni-NTA resin (GE healthcare; for BARD1124-270) for 2 h. The 
affinity resin was transferred to a glass column (1.5 × 15 cm), washed with 20 ml buffer D, 
before being eluted 3 times with 3 ml of 20 mM glutathione or 150 mM imidazole in buffer 
D. For BARD1124-270, the His6-SUMO tag was cleaved by the Ulp1 protease by an 
overnight incubation at 4°C. The eluates were pooled and concentrated in a Centricon-10K 
concentrator (Amicon) to 0.5 ml before being further fractionated in a Superdex 200 10/300 
GL column (GE Healthcare) with 24 ml of buffer C containing 300 mM KCl. The peak 
fractions were pooled, concentrated to ~100 μl as above, divided into 5 μl portions, frozen in 
liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C.
Other recombination proteins—BRCA2-DSS1, RAD51, RPA and yeast Rad51 were 
purified to near homogeneity using our previously described procedures36,51,52.

 DNA substrates and DNA binding assay
D-loop, DNA bubble, replication fork and double-stranded DNA were assembled from 
oligonucleotides 5/6/7, oligonucleotides 5/6, oligonucleotides 8/9/10/11 and 
oligonucleotides 12/13, respectively (see Extended Data Table 1 for oligonucleotide 
sequences); the asterisk identifies the oligonucleotide that was 32P-labeled at its 5′ end in 
each substrate. The single-stranded DNA substrate was 5′ 32P-labeled oligonucleotide 12. 
These DNA substrates (10 nM each) were incubated with wild type or the specified mutant 
form of BRCA1-BARD1 at 37°C in 10 μl buffer E (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 90 mM KCl, 1 
mM DTT, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA)) for 10 min. After the addition of 
loading buffer (50% glycerol, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.05% Orange G), 
the reaction mixtures were resolved by 6% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in TAE 
buffer (30 mM Tris-acetate, pH 7.4 and 0.5 mM EDTA) at 4°C. The gels were dried, and 
DNA species were visualized by autoradiography and quantified using the Personal 
Molecular Imager™ and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Since the nucleoprotein 
complexes formed by BRCA1-BARD1 do not always migrate as well-defined species, we 
quantified DNA binding by measuring the disappearance of the DNA substrate.
Affinity pulldown
RAD51, yRad51 or RecA (5 μM) was incubated with 0.5 μM of Flag-BRCA1-BARD1 or 3 
μM of GST-BARD1123-162 at 4°C for 30 min in 30 μl buffer F (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 
10% Glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.05% Igepal CA-630, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 150 mM 
KCl). Then, the reaction mixture was mixed with 12 μl anti-Flag M2 affinity resin or 
Glutathione Sepharose 4 Fast Flow resin at 4°C for 30 min to capture protein complexes 
through the Flag tag on BRCA1 or the GST tag on BARD1, respectively. After washing the 
resin three times with 200 μl buffer F, bound proteins were eluted with 20 μl 2% SDS at 
37°C for 5 min. The supernatant (S), last wash (W) and SDS eluate (E), 8 μl each, were 
analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining.
Southwestern analysis
BRCA1-BARD1 was resolved in a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto a 
nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) at 4°C in transfer buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, 192 mM 
glycine, pH 8.3, 20% methanol). After being soaked in buffer G (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 
mg/ml BSA, 1 mM DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol and 100 mM KCl) at 4°C for 20 
h, the membrane was rinsed twice with buffer H (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 μg/ml BSA, 
90 mM KCl, 4 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM DTT) and then incubated in 10 ml buffer H containing 
32P-labeled D-loop DNA (2 nM) at 25°C for 1 h. The membrane was washed four times 
with 10 ml buffer H before analysis by phosphorimaging.
Far Western analysis
After SDS-PAGE, BRCA1 and BARD1 were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, as 
described for the Southwestern analysis. The membrane was soaked in buffer I (10 mM 
KH2PO4 at pH 7.4, 150 mM KCl, 15 mg/ml BSA, 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% Tween 
20) at 25°C for 2 h and then incubated with 5 μg/ml RAD51 in buffer I at 25°C for 2 h. 
Then, the membrane was washed with 10 ml buffer I three times, incubated with anti-

 RAD51-HRP antibodies (Abcam, ab195548) for 1 h in buffer I, washed again with 10 ml 
buffer I three times, and developed with the Super Signal Substrate Kit (Pierce).
Homologous DNA pairing assay
This was conducted as described36,37. The reaction was assembled in buffer J (25 mM Tris-
HCl, pH 7.5, 60 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT and 100 μg/ml BSA) containing 1 mM ATP and 2 
mM MgCl2 in a final volume of 12.5 μl. For mediator activity, the 150-mer oligonucleotide 
14 (6 μM nucleotides) was first incubated with RPA (600 nM) at 37°C for 5 min, and then 
RAD51 (2 μM) with or without the indicated concentration of BRCA1-BARD1 or BRCA2-
DSS1 was incorporated into the reaction. Following a 5-min incubation at 37°C, 32P-labeled 
homologous dsDNA (40 bp; oligos 15 & 16; 1.6 μM base pairs) and 4 mM spermidine 
hydrochloride were added. For testing of ssDNA targeting activity, RAD51 was incubated 
with the mixture of ssDNA, 32P-labeled dsDNA and spermidine hydrochloride with and 
without BRCA1-BARD1 or BRCA2-DSS1 for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by 
adding an equal volume of 1% SDS containing 1 mg/ml proteinase K. Following a 5-min 
incubation at 37°C, the deproteinized reaction mixtures were resolved in an 8% non-
denaturing polyacrylamide gel in TAE buffer. The gel was dried onto 3MM CHR cellulose 
chromatography papers (GE Healthcare), and DNA species were visualized by 
autoradiography and quantified, as above.
D-loop assay
This was conducted as described42,53. Briefly, the 32P-labeled 90-mer oligonucleotide 17 
(2.4 μM nucleotides) was incubated with RAD51 (1 μM) at 37°C for 5 min in buffer J 
containing 1 mM MgCl2 and 2 mM ATP or AMP-PNP. Following the incorporation of the 
indicated concentration of BRCA1-BARD1 and a 5-min incubation at 37°C, the Dloop 
reaction was initiated by adding pBluescript SK replicative form I DNA (37 μM base pairs) 
and was incubated at 37°C for 7 min. The molar ratio of the 90-mer to pBluescript plasmid 
in the reactions was 2.1 to 1. The reaction was terminated by adding an equal volume of 1% 
SDS containing 1 mg/ml proteinase K and a 5-min incubation at 37°C. The deproteinized 
reaction mixtures were resolved by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel, which was dried 
onto Hybond™ -N membrane (GE Healthcare). Phosphorimaging analysis was used to 
visualize and quantify the radiolabeled DNA species.
Synaptic complex assay
The assay was conducted at 37°C as described5,6. Briefly, RAD51 (4 μM) was incubated 
with the 60-mer oligonucleotide 18 (12 μM nucleotide), which is homologous to the SspI 
restriction site in the target pUC19 dsDNA, in 8 μl of buffer K (35 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 
mM KCl, 2 mM ATP, 2 mM MgCl2, 100 μg/ml BSA, and 1 mM DTT) for 5 min. After 
adding the indicated amounts of BRCA1-BARD1 in 1 μl volume, the reaction mixture was 
incubated for 5 min. Then, linear pUC19 plasmid DNA (85 μM nucleotides) was added in 1 
μl, followed by a 5-min incubation and the treatment with 2.5 units of SspI for 10 min. The 
reaction mixtures were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis in TAE buffer, and DNA 
species were stained with ethidium bromide. The heterologous oligonucleotide 19 (Extended 
Data Table 1) was used as a control.

 DNA curtain imaging analysis
RAD51 filaments were assembled on ssDNA curtains, and the dsDNA-binding properties of 
the resulting RAD51-ssDNA filaments were measured as described39,40. To determine the 
number of dsDNA-binding events, BRCA1-BARD1 was diluted from a 1.5 μM stock with 
Buffer K (30 mM Tris–acetate pH 7.5, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2, 100 mM KCl, 2 mM 
ATP, 1 mM DTT, and 0.2 mg/ml BSA) to concentrations ranging from 10–100 nM, 
introduced into the flow cell chamber, followed by a 10-min incubation at 37°C. After 
washing with 1 ml of Buffer K (at 1 ml/min), 2.16 nM Atto565-labeled dsDNA (70-bp) with 
9-nt of homology (oligos 20 & 21) to the RAD51-ssDNA filaments was introduced into the 
chamber, followed by a 10-min incubation at 37°C. Then, the cell was washed with 0.5 ml 
buffer K (at 1 ml/min) and three images were taken. The length of each of the RAD51-
ssDNA filaments and number of labeled-dsDNA molecules bound were recorded and 
normalized to a length of 50 pixels (~40kb). Weighted average and standard deviation based 
on the length of each filament were calculated. Confidence intervals of 95% are represented 
as error bars. For survival probabilities, experiments were conducted without or with 100 
nM BRCA1-BARD1 and 100 ms exposures were recorded every 30 seconds over 90 min. 
Dwell times of ~180 molecules were determined for each experiment by kymograph and 
survival probabilities were plotted on a semi-log plot. Error bars represent 70% confidence 
as measured by bootstrap analysis, a close approximation of one standard deviation from the 
mean.
Cell culture and transfection
U2OS and HeLa cells from ATCC were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagles medium 
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 
100 U/ml penicillin (Sigma). The cells were tested for mycoplasma contamination by 
Bionique testing labs (http://www.bionique.com/). Qiagen siRNA oligonucleotides used to 
transiently deplete BARD1 and BRCA1 are listed in Extended Data Table 1. 53BP1 siRNA 
(s14313) was purchased from Ambion-Thermo Fisher Scientific. Transfection of siRNA, pS-
Flag-SBP-BARD1res and pCMV-I-SceI-3xNLS was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To generate stable HeLa and 
U2OS cell lines expressing Flag-SBP-BARD1 or its mutants, cells were transfected with 
their respective plasmids (pS-Flag-SBP-BARD1WTres, pSFlag-SBP-BARD1AAEres, and pS-
Flag-SBP-BARD1K140Nres) and individual clones were selected with 800 μg/ml G418.
Co-immunoprecipitation analysis
HeLa cells grown on 15 cm cell culture dishes were treated with or without 1 μM MMC 
overnight prior to harvest. Following a wash with PBS (phosphate buffered saline), cells 
were scraped off and transferred to Eppendorf tubes. Whole cell lysate was prepared by 
adding 1 ml of lysis buffer (300 mM NaCl, 1.0% Triton X-100, 5 mM EDTA, 2 mM NaVO4, 
2 mM Na4O7P2, 0.02% NaN3, and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.4) with protease inhibitors (Roche 
Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet) to cell pellets. Following a 12-s sonication, the 
cell extract was cleared by centrifugation at 18,400g for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant 
fraction (2 mg protein in total) was incubated with DNase I (20U) for 15 min at room 
temperature and 15 min at 37°C. Then, 50 μl of anti-Flag resin (Sigma) or anti-mouse IgG

 resin (Santa Cruz) was added, followed by a 12 h incubation at 4°C overnight. After washing 
the resin 4 times with lysis buffer, bound proteins were eluted with 100 μl SDS gel loading 
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromophenol blue, 10% glycerol, 10% 2-
mercaptoethanol) and 100 μl of the eluates were subject to Western blot analysis with anti-
Flag and anti-RAD51 antibodies.
Immunoblot analysis
Protein was extracted from cells harvested two days after transfection with the indicated 
siRNAs using NETN buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 420 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% 
Igepal CA-630, 1 mM DTT, and Roche Protease Inhibitor Cocktail) and 8 freeze/thaw 
cycles. Blots (20–50 μg of total protein) were probed with the following antibodies: BARD1 
(Bethyl, A300-263A; Santa Cruz Biotech, Sc11438), BRCA1 (Abcam, ab16780), 53BP1 
(Abcam, ab36823), Flag M2-HRP (Sigma, A8592), Phospho RPA32 S4/S8 (Bethyl, 
A300-245A), BRCA2 (EMD Millipore, OP95-100UG), RAD51 (Santa Cruz Biotech, 
sc-8349), Actin (Abcam, ab3280), Tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotech, sc-53030), HA.11 (16B12) 
(Covance, MMS-101P), or GST-HRP (NEB, E2624S) according to the instructions provided 
by the manufacturers. If needed, the blots were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary 
antibodies (Pierce 31450 for rabbit anti-mouse IgG-HRP; Sigma A6154 for goat anti-rabbit 
IgG-HRP; Santa Cruz Biotech Sc-2032 for goat anti-rat IgG-HRP) before visualization of 
protein signals using the ECL kit (Thermo Scientific Pierce).
DR-GFP reporter assay
The DR-U2OS cell line containing a single integrated copy of the DR-GFP reporter was 
used46,47. Exponentially growing cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 2 × 105 cells per well 
prior to transfection with 2 μl siRNA (20 μM) and 5 μl Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen). 
One day after siRNA transfection, cells were transfected with 2 μg I-SceI expression vector 
(pCBASce) and 5 μl Lipofectamine™ 2000. HR proficiency was determined by counting the 
fraction of GFP-positive cells using a BD FACS Calibur S at 72 h post I-SceI transfection. 
The results were derived from 3 to 5 transfections of at least 3 independent experiments.
CRISPR/Cas9-induced gene targeting assay
The assay was conducted as described48. U2OS cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 2 × 105 
cells prior to transfection with 2 μl siRNA (20 μM) and 5 μl Lipofectamine™ 2000 
(Invitrogen). One day after siRNA transfection, cells were co-transfected with 1.6 μg sgRNA 
plasmid pX330-LMNA1 (from Graham Dellaire) and 0.4 μg donor template pCR2.1-
CloverLamin (from Graham Dellaire) and 5 μl Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen). Gene 
targeting efficiency was determined by counting the percent of Clover-positive cells using a 
BD FACS Calibur S at 72 h post plasmids co-transfection. The results were derived from 3 
to 5 transfections of at least 3 independent experiments.
Immunofluorescence microscopy and image analysis
HeLa Cells in exponential growth were transfected on two consecutive days in Opti-MEM 
medium using RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) with 20 nM BARD1 or control siRNA, as 
recommended by the manufacturer. Exposure to γ-ray was performed using a 137Cs γ-

 irradiator (J.L. Shepherd, model 81-14) and a dose rate of 1.05 Gy/min. 
Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described54, except that cells were 
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min and permeabilized in 0.4% 
Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Rabbit anti-RAD51 (H-92; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 
1:2000) and goat anti-rabbit AlexaFluor-488 secondary antibodies (Invitrogen; 1:750) were 
used. For image capture of RAD51 foci, Z-stack section images consisting of 20 stacks (0.2 
μm intervals) from 100–150 nuclei per sample were taken using a 63×oil objective and a 
Zeiss Axio-Imager.Z2 microscope equipped with Zen Blue software (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, 
LLC, Thornwood, NY). For computational analyses of foci, Z-stacks were collapsed down 
to the maximum intensity projections, and a combination of ImageJ (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/
ij/) and Cell Profiler (http://www.cellprofiler.org/) software programs was used with the 
following custom program settings for image processing: minimum object size=3; maximum 
object size=35; despeckle ratio=0.3; rolling ball size=5. A custom-built pipeline for 
automated cell (80–300 pixel units) and foci counting with settings for shape (i.e. 0.5) and 
dimensions (i.e. 5 pixels diameter) was employed. The threshold for foci detection was 
determined based on sham-irradiated samples, and nuclei with >5 foci/nucleus were counted 
positive. Group allocation and outcome assessment were done in a fully blinded manner.
Clonogenic survival assay
HeLa cells were transiently transfected with siRNA as described above. After 48 hours, cells 
were seeded into 6-well plates at 50–32,000 cells/well, treated with 0, 5, 10 and 20 nM 
MMC (Sigma) or 0, 0.5, 1 and 2 μM Olaparib (Selleckchem) in regular growth medium for 
14 days. Cells were fixed with 10% methanol and 10% acetic acid, and stained with 1% 
crystal violet in methanol before colonies were counted. Clonogenic survival was 
determined for a given concentration of cells that were plated by dividing the number of 
colonies on each treated plate by the number of colonies on the untreated plate, taking the 
plating efficiency of untreated cells into account.
Preparation of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts
The Dignam method for the preparation of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts was followed55. 
Briefly, 109 cells were washed with PBS and Dignam buffer A (10 mM Hepes pH 7.9, 1.5 
mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT and 0.5 mM PMSF), collected by centrifugation, 
and lyzed in 2 packed cell volumes of Dignam buffer A using a Dounce homogenizer (50 
strokes) with the type A pestle. After centrifugation, the supernatant containing cytoplasmic 
proteins was saved for analysis. The pelleted nuclei were resuspended and lysed in 3 ml 
Dignam buffer C (20 mM Hepes pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 420 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 
mM DTT, 25% glycerol, and 0.5 mM PMSF) using a Dounce homogenizer (80 strokes) with 
the type B pestle. Debris was removed by centrifugation to yield the nuclear extract fraction. 
The cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, 20 μg each, were analyzed by immunoblotting for 
their content of BRCA1, Flag-SBPBARD1, Tubulin and Histone H3.
Statistics and Reproducibility
The statistical analysis was performed using Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, 
CA; http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/ttest1.cfm) on the data from at least three 
independent experiments, as specified. Unless stated otherwise, statistical significance was

 Fig. 6. Model for BRCA1-BARD1 functions
Aside from a co-operative role with PALB2-BRCA2 in RAD51 presynaptic filament 
assembly (green arrows), our work has revealed a function of BRCA1-BARD1 in the 
promotion of homologous DNA pairing (red arrows). Previous studies have provided 
evidence that BRCA1-BARD1 antagonizes 53BP1 in DNA end resection (green blocks) and 
promotes MRN/CtIP activity (green arrows), and for a role of the complex in cell cycle 
checkpoint regulation (green arrows).
