published December 28, 2016; doi:10.1152/jn.00575.2016.—Brain in
vitro models are critically important to developing our understanding
of basic nervous system cellular physiology, potential neurotoxic
effects of chemicals, and specific cellular mechanisms of many
disease states. In this study, we sought to address key shortcomings of
current brain in vitro models: the scarcity of comparative data for cells
originating from distinct brain regions and the lack of multiregional
brain in vitro models. We demonstrated that rat neurons from different
brain regions exhibit unique profiles regarding their cell composition,
protein expression, metabolism, and electrical activity in vitro. In
vivo, the brain is unique in its structural and functional organization,
and the interactions and communication between different brain areas
are essential components of proper brain function. This fact and the
observation that neurons from different areas of the brain exhibit
unique behaviors in vitro underline the importance of establishing
multiregional brain in vitro models. Therefore, we here developed a
multiregional brain-on-a-chip and observed a reduction of overall
firing activity, as well as altered amounts of astrocytes and specific
neuronal cell types compared with separately cultured neurons. Fur-
thermore, this multiregional model was used to study the effects of
phencyclidine, a drug known to induce schizophrenia-like symptoms in
vivo, on individual brain areas separately while monitoring downstream
effects on interconnected regions. Overall, this work provides a compar-
ison of cells from different brain regions in vitro and introduces a
multiregional brain-on-a-chip that enables the development of unique
disease models incorporating essential in vivo features.
NEW & NOTEWORTHY Due to the scarcity of comparative data
for cells from different brain regions in vitro, we demonstrated that
neurons isolated from distinct brain areas exhibit unique behaviors in
vitro. Moreover, in vivo proper brain function is dependent on the
connection and communication of several brain regions, underlining
the importance of developing multiregional brain in vitro models. We
introduced a novel brain-on-a-chip model, implementing essential in
vivo features, such as different brain areas and their functional
connections.

physiology; metabolism
KORBINIAN BRODMANN (1868–1918) was one of the first scien-
tists to categorize the brain into 52 distinct areas based on
cellular organization, and confirmed the already strongly be-
lieved localist view, which supported the opinion that the brain
consists of functionally and structurally distinct regions (Finger
2001). Decades later, much scientific effort has been spent
confirming these views, e.g., observations of brain region-
dependent microenvironments and cell compositions (Dauth et
al. 2016; Herculano-Houzel 2009), and gaining more detailed
information about brain organization and function by develop-
ing in vitro methods to culture nerve cells. While these in vitro
models play an essential role in the understanding of basic
physiological processes of nervous system cells, as well as help
in encoding disease mechanisms (Karetko and Skangiel-Kram-
ska 2009), there is still a lack of information comparing cells
from different brain areas in vitro, mitigating our efforts to
understand the building blocks of in vitro models.
Another often overlooked feature in the field of brain in vitro
models is that the brain is unique in its structural and functional
organization, and that the interactions and communication
between different brain areas are essential components of
proper brain function (Asher et al. 2001; Bradbury et al. 2002;
Buzsáki and Draguhn 2004; Clark et al. 2007; Luna et al. 2007;
Yip et al. 2006). There are currently very few in vitro models
incorporating cells from two different brain regions (Kato-
Negishi et al. 2013; Peyrin et al. 2011). Advances in the
induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) field also give rise to
the high potential of brain organoids, currently restricted to
only a few brain structures, but supporting the notion that it
is important to recapitulate different brain regions in vitro
(Qian et al. 2016). These organoids have their own advan-
tages and disadvantages, but represent a promising in vitro
model (Lancaster et al. 2013; Qian et al. 2016). Not only is the
connectivity between distinct brain regions essential for physiol-
ogy, but it is often disturbed in brain pathology (Seeley et al.
2009). One example is schizophrenia, where the prefrontal
cortex (pfCx), hippocampus (Hip) and amygdala (Amy) are
affected, including molecular alterations, as well as an abnor-

 mal connectivity and communication between these regions
(Benes 2009).
In this work, we assessed the differences between in vitro
cultures originating from different rat brain regions (pfCx, Hip,
and Amy) by comparing their cell composition, such as neu-
ronal and nonneuronal cells, protein expression levels, metab-
olism, and electrophysiology and observed a unique profile for
each of these parameters in vitro. In this study, rat brain cells
are used, because primary human Amy cells are not currently
available, and iPSCs cannot yet generate cells with a specific
brain region identity (e.g., pfCx, Hip, Amy). Moreover, animal
models have proven invaluable to better understand brain
diseases (Asher et al. 2001; Lipska and Weinberger 2000), and
animal models, as well as rodent in vitro models, are still
commonly used for drug development and safety assessments
(Dubreuil et al. 2006; Lecanu and Papadopoulos 2013; Ram-
nauth et al. 2012). To address the importance of the presence
and connection of different brain areas in vivo, we developed
a multiregional brain-on-a-chip, consisting of three separated
areas of neuronal cell bodies derived from the pfCx, Hip, and
Amy that are functionally connected through axons. Both, cell
composition and electrophysiology were altered in the brain-
on-a-chip model compared with separately cultured cells. The
primary advantages of this new model are the presence of
functionally interconnected brain areas and the ability to treat
one brain region specifically with a drug and assess the effects
on parameters, such as electrophysiology, on all interconnected
brain areas. Here, we used phencyclidine (PCP) to induce a
schizophrenia-like state in vitro (Adachi et al. 2013) and
analyzed the effect on the electrical behavior of all three brain
regions in vitro. The brain-on-a-chip model presented here can
be easily adapted to human neuron cultures when these brain
region-specific populations become available.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Primary Neuronal and Glial Cell Harvest and Culture
Neurons from the pfCx, the Hip, and the Amy were isolated from
2-day-old female and male neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles
River Laboratories, Boston, MA). The 2-day-old pups were decapi-
tated without prior anesthesia. All procedures were approved by the
Harvard Animal Care and Use Committee. Using 2-day-old neonatal
rats for the isolation of neurons is a widespread and commonly used
method. Reasons include a higher percentage of neurogenesis (and
therefore pluripotent cells) and the ability to better adjust to a new
environment and survive the isolation procedure (“regenerative po-
tential”) in the younger brain (Anderson and Anderson 1996; Nunez
2008; Oberdoerster 2001). Brain regions were surgically isolated and
minced in Hibernate-A solution supplemented with B-27 (�50, di-
luted 1:50 to achieve �1 B27) and glutamax (0.5 mM; HABG) (all
GIBCO Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), followed by digestion
with papain (16 mg in 8 ml, ~34 U/ml; Worthington Biochemical,
Lakewood, NJ) for 30 min at 37°C. Tissues from the Hip and the pfCx
were isolated from the same set of animals and used for neuronal
isolation. Tissue from the Amy was isolated from a separate set of
animals. The digested tissue was then transferred to fresh HABG and
mechanically disrupted using silane-treated glass pipettes. The me-
chanical disruption was done by pipetting the tissue up and down for
~10 times. After the remaining tissue settled down, the supernatant
was collected and transferred to a fresh tube. These steps were
repeated two more times. The collected supernatants were then filtered
through a nylon filter of 40-�m pore size (BD Bioscience, San Jose,
CA) and centrifuged at 200 g for 5 min. The supernatant was
removed, and the pellet was resuspended in prewarmed neurobasal A
medium supplemented with B-27 (�1), glutamax (0.5 mM) and
gentamycin (10 �g/ml; all GIBCO Life Technologies, Grand Island,
NY). Neuronal cells were counted using a Moxi Mini Automated Cell
Counter (Orflo, Ketchum, ID) and seeded at the desired density (1.6
K cells/mm2) on substrates coated with 100 �g/ml poly-L-lysine
(PLL, Sigma, St. Louis, MO). After 1 h, cells were washed once with
HABG to remove nonadherent cells. All samples were cultured in
neurobasal A medium supplemented with B-27 (�1), glutamax (0.5
mM) and gentamycin (10 �g/ml) and incubated under standard
conditions at 37°C and 5% CO2. Media was replaced by removing
one-half and adding fresh media every 72 h until experiments were
executed.
Immunofluorescent Staining and Microscopy
Cells were washed two times with prewarmed PBS, fixed for 10
min with prewarmed 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized for 10 min
with 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature, and blocked
with 3–5% bovine serum albumin (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West
Grove, PA) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The blocking
solution was aspirated away, and the primary antibody solution was
immediately added and incubated for 1.5 h at 37°C or overnight at
4°C. The primary antibodies used were anti-�III-tubulin (1:200;
Sigma, St. Louis, MO), anti-neurofilament (NF) (1:100; Abcam,
Cambridge, MA), anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; 1:200;
Abcam, Cambridge, MA), anti-glutamate decarboxylase (GAD)
1/GAD67 (1:100; Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), and anti-vesic-
ular glutamate transporter (Vglut) 1 (1:100; Abcam, Cambridge, MA).
Primary antibodies were diluted in 0.5% BSA in PBS solution. Following
primary staining, cells were washed three times with PBS, and the
secondary staining solution consisting of either goat anti-mouse/rabbit/
chicken conjugated to Alexa-Fluor 488, goat anti-mouse/rabbit/chicken
conjugated to Alexa-Fluor 546, or goat anti-mouse/rabbit/chicken conju-
gated to Alexa-Fluor 633 (Molecular Probes, Grand Island, NY), and
4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes Life Technologies,
Grand Island, NY) was added to the cells for 1 h at 37°C. Samples
were then washed three times with PBS. For glass bottom samples, the
glass was removed from the dish and placed on a glass slide. ProLong
Gold Antifade reagent (Molecular Probes Life Technologies, Grand
Island, NY) was added to preserve the samples, and glass coverslips
are affixed using transparent nail polish. Prepared slides were either
imaged immediately or stored at 4°C. Imaging was performed with an
Olympus confocal microscope or an Olympus VS120 Slide Scanner
(both Olympus, Center Valley, PA) with appropriate filter cubes. The
GAD, Vglut, and GFAP positive cells were counted manually for each
image using ImageJ.
Proteomics
Cell preparation. Cells were harvested as detailed above. After 14
days in culture, medium was removed, cells were washed with PBS,
and incubated with RIPA buffer (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) comple-
mented with protease inhibitors (Complete Mini, Roche, Basel, Swit-
zerland) and 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride
(AEBSF, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) on ice for 5 min. Afterwards, cells
were scraped off the surface with a cell scraper and lysed cells were
transferred to a microcentrifuge tube on ice. Samples were centrifuged
at 17,000 g for 30 min at 4°C. Supernatants were transferred to a fresh
Eppendorf tube and centrifuged again at 17,000 g for 30 min at 4°C.
The resulting supernatants were used for analysis.
Tissue preparation. Tissue samples were harvested from adult
Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Boston, MA). All
procedures were approved by the Harvard Animal Care and Use
Committee. Adult rats were killed using CO2 and cervical dislocation.
Two-day-old pups were decapitated. Brains were dissected out of the
skull, and the pfCx, the Hip, and the Amy were further surgically

 dissected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were thawed
and homogenized using a hand homogenizer (Cole-Parmer, Vernon
Hills, IL) in RIPA buffer (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and complemented
with protease inhibitors (Complete Mini, Roche, Basel, Switzerland)
and AEBSF (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). All steps were conducted on ice.
After homogenization, samples were embedded in ice and placed on
a rocking platform shaker for 30 min. Afterwards samples were
centrifuged at 17,000 g for 30 min at 4°C. Supernatants were trans-
ferred to a fresh Eppendorf tube and centrifuged again at 17,000 g for
30 min at 4°C. The resulting supernatants were used for analysis.
Tandem mass tag labeling and electrostatic repulsion-hydrophilic
interaction chromatography off-line fractionation. Samples were
measured to 100 �g of total protein in each sample. Samples were
digested using a slightly modified filter-aided sample preparation
protocol, as previously published (Wis
´niewski et al. 2009). Subse-
quently, all samples were labeled by tandem mass tags (TMT) 10plex
reagent (product no. 90061, Thermo Fisher, San Jose, CA), according
to manufacturer protocol. The TMT10plex reagent set enables up to
10 different peptide samples prepared from cells or tissues to be
labeled in parallel and then combined for analysis. For each sample,
a unique reporter mass in the low-mass region of the high-resolution
tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectrum is used to measure
relative protein expression levels during peptide fragmentation and
MS/MS. The resulting labeled 10 samples were pooled into one
sample for an off-line fractionation. The high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) 1200 Agilent system with fraction collector
(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) was used for an electrostatic
repulsion-hydrophilic interaction chromatography (ERLIC) separa-
tion using PolyWAX LP columns (200 � 2.1 mm, 5 �m, 300 Å;
PolyLC, Columbia, MD). ERLIC utilizes both hydrophilic interaction
and electrostatic forces. By adjusting the pH, salt type, salt concen-
tration, and organic solvent compositions in the mobile phase, an
isocratic separation of a mixture of charged analytes (e.g., peptides,
amino acids, and nucleotides) can be achieved (Alpert 2008). Samples
were fractionated to a total of 20 fractions on a 70-min liquid
chromatography gradient. Each fraction was submitted for mass
spectrometry analysis.
Mass spectrometry and data analysis. Samples were run on Or-
bitrap Velos Pro (Thermo Fisher, San Jose, CA) for all analytical runs.
Orbitrap Velos Pro is a hybrid ion trap-Orbitrap mass spectrometer
which is ideal for identification of low-level proteins in complex
matrices, rapid quantitation of isobarically labeled peptides, and
structural elucidation of metabolites. Samples were injected from
autosampler of HPLC (Waters, NanoAquity, Milford, MA) into trap-
ping column (75 �m column inner diameter, 5 cm packed with C18
media on 5-�m beats on 200 Å poros, from Michrom Bioresources,
Auburn, CA). After binding in trapping column, peptides were
washed for 15 min with buffer A (0.1% formic acid in water) and then
eluted to an analytical column (75 �m column inner diameter, 20 cm
packed with 3-�m C18 media beats on 100 Å poros) with a gradient
from 2 to 32% of buffer B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) over a
90-min gradient for each fraction. Each sample was run on Orbitrap
Velos instrument with a high-collisional energy/collisional-induced
dissociation (HCD/CID) top 20 method that isolates and fragments
top ions that came at a particular time of the chromatogram from
nanoflow HPLC (HCD fragmentation in Orbitrap was followed by
CID event in the ion trap part of the instrument). HCD/CID is used to
sequence the peptides present in the samples. The Orbitrap Velos Pro
instrument was set up to run the TOP 20 method for MS/MS in ion
trap with an exclusion function turned on after MS1 scan in Orbitrap
with 60 K resolving power at a mass of 400 m/z. For TMT10plex
labeling, MS2 data were acquired with 30 K resolving power; for
TMT6plex, MS2 data were collected with 15 K resolving power.
Obtained runs were analyzed by Proteome Discoverer 1.4.1.14
(Thermo Fisher, San Jose, CA) software with Percolator version 2.05
(University of Washington) as a statistical data package. Searches
were done against rat proteome database filtered out of the Uniprot
database by species specificity, and common contaminants that were
added to this database. Searches were done with trypsin enzyme
specificity, allowing two missed cleavages. Possible modification
included in the search parameters were: protein NH2-terminus acety-
lation, methionine oxidation, deamidation of asparagine, and glu-
tamine amino acids were put as a variable modification as well as for
static modifications NH2-terminus of peptide TMT6plex labeling and
lysine side chains with TMT6plex labeling group. The database search
criteria were held at 1% false discovery rate on both protein and on
peptide levels for all output reported data. All data outputs were
filtered to 40% maximum co-isolation of MS1, allowing TMT quan-
titation results to be kept under control from co-isolation effect.
Gene expression dynamics inspector. Visual representations of the
global protein expression profiles of the pfCx, Hip, and Amy neuron
populations were created using Gene Expression Dynamics Inspector
(GEDI) version 2.1 software (Eichler et al. 2003). This program uses
a self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm to reduce data dimensionality
by classifying proteins with similar expression profiles into discrete
groups that are organized into distinct two-dimensional mosaics. Each
tile of these mosaics represents a cluster of proteins, and the mapping
of proteins to these tiles is conserved across samples to facilitate
comparison. Coloration of each mosaic tile indicates the fold change
value of the centroid learned during SOM training. For the proteomics
data collected in this study, GEDI mosaic grid size was set to 18 � 20.
SOM training occurred in two phases with 200 iterations in the first
phase, and 800 iterations in the second phase. All other SOM param-
eter settings were set to default values.
Proteomaps. Proteomaps illustrating the composition and abun-
dance of the functional categories represented in the pfCx, Hip, and
Amy neuron proteomes were constructed using proteomaps version
2.0 software (Liebermeister et al. 2014). These maps are constructed
from Voronoi diagrams that are divided into polygons representing
top level KEGG orthology biological process terms, which are, in
turn, subdivided based on the subcategories represented in the protein
expression data set. The area of the individual polygons comprising
the map is a function of the abundance of the proteins they represent.
The coloration of the polygons facilitates visual distinction of the
biological processes represented in the proteomaps and has no quan-
titative interpretation.
Principal component analysis. Principal component analysis
(PCA) was used to identify proteins in the pfCx, Hip, and Amy mass
spectrometry data whose expression levels exhibited the greatest
variability between the three neuron populations tested (Ringnér
2008). PCA was performed using the implementation provided in the
scikit-learn machine learning Python package, version 0.17-4. Scat-
terplots of the fold change values projected onto the two dimensions
that explain the most variance, color coded according to their associ-
ated Gene Ontology biological process term, were created using the
Python package Matplotlib, version 1.5.1-5.
Correlation analysis. Pearson product moment correlation (Brang-
wynne et al. 2006) was used to assess the degree of linear correlation
between pairwise comparisons of the fold change protein expression
values collected for pfCx, Hip, and Amy neuron cultures. Pairwise
comparisons were performed using the corr() function provided in the
PANDAS version 0.18.0-7 Python package, and visualized using the
Seaborn statistical data visualization Python package, version 0.7.1.
Ingenuity pathway analysis. QIAGEN’s Ingenuity Pathway Anal-
ysis (IPA, QIAGEN Redwood City, https://www.qiagenbioinformat-
ics.com/) was used to identify pathways for which a substantial
number of upstream regulators are present in the protein expression
data set, as inferred from z-score analysis based on prior knowledge
stored in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base. This analysis examines the
number of known targets.
Protein-protein interaction network analysis. Protein-protein inter-
action networks were constructed using the Search Tool for Retrieval
of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) database, version 10.0 (Sz-
klarczyk et al. 2015). The STRING database stores information about

 functional relationships between proteins that are derived from a
number of sources. For the analyses performed in this study, only
known experimental interactions imported from primary database
sources, and pathway knowledge parsed from manually curated data-
bases, were considered. Edges in the network graphs were chosen to
represent the confidence that the interaction between two proteins
represents a true functional interaction, as judged from evidence
provided by the knowledge sources considered. The length of the
edges between each pair of protein nodes in the protein-protein
interaction networks was computed using a spring-like model to
cluster higher confidence protein-protein interactions closer together
into functionally-related clusters. Only high-confidence interactions
(i.e., interaction scores � 0.7) were considered in this study.
Seahorse Mitochondrial Respiration Measurements
Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was measured using the Seahorse
XF96 equipment (Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA). The
Seahorse XF Cell Mito Stress Test was used to measure key param-
eters of mitochondrial function by directly measuring the OCR of
cells. The Seahorse XF Cell Mito Stress Test uses modulators of
respiration to target components of the electron transport chain (ETC)
in the mitochondria to observe key parameters of metabolic function.
The compounds [oligomycin, carbonyl cyanide-4 (trifluoromethoxy)
phenylhydrazone (FCCP), and a mix of rotenone and antimycin A]
(Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA) are serially injected to
measure ATP production, maximal respiration, and nonmitochondrial
respiration, respectively. The proton leak is then calculated using
these parameters and basal respiration. Each of the modulators used
targets a specific component of the ETC. Oligomycin inhibits complex
V of ATP synthase. The decrease in OCR that follows the injection of
oligomycin correlates to the mitochondrial respiration associated with
cellular ATP production. FCCP is an uncoupling agent that collapses
the proton gradient and disrupts the membrane potential of mitochon-
dria. In turn, electron flow through the ETC is uninhibited, and oxygen
is maximally consumed by complex IV. The last injection is a mix of
rotenone, inhibiting complex I, and antimycin A, inhibiting complex
III. This combination shuts down mitochondrial respiration and en-
ables the calculation of nonmitochondrial respiration driven by pro-
cesses taking place outside the mitochondria (http://www.agilent.com/
cs/library/usermanuals/public/XF_Cell_Mito_Stress_Test_Kit_User_
Guide.pdf). The procedure was performed according to the manufac-
turers’ manual (see above). Briefly, neurons from the pfCx, the Hip,
and the Amy were seeded at the same density (100 K/well) and
cultured for 2 wk. Just before the assay was carried out, the cell
culture medium was replaced by the assay medium, which contains
100 ml aCSF (440 mg BSA, 100 mg glucose, 0.5 mM HEPES). The
solution pH was adjusted to 7.4, and for 10 ml assay medium 110 mg
sodium pyruvate was added. For the next step, cells were placed into
a 37°C non-CO2 incubator for 45 min to 1 h. Afterwards, the plate was
placed into the Seahorse apparatus after a calibration run was com-
pleted, and the assay was run.
Soft Photolithography and Polydimethylsiloxane Mask Fabrication
A photomask with the desired patterns (line pattern: 15 �m � 15
�m or 10 �m � 15 �m) was created using computer-assisted design
software and standard photolithography methods, and then the mask
was used to shadow a wafer glass covered with a photoresist when
exposed to ultraviolet light. The thickness of the photoresist layer
determines the depth of the grooves, and the width is determined by
the photomask line patterns when the light-exposed areas of the
photoresist are dissolved away. Specifically, silicon wafers (Univer-
sity Wafer) were treated for 10 s with plasma, and SU-8-2002 was
spin coated on top of them. Afterwards, wafers were prebaked for 30
s at 65°C, 1 min at 95°C, and 30 s at 65°C on a hot plate. A
transparency photomask was used to produce the master by exposing
the wafer to UV light for ~10 s. Wafers were then postbaked at 65°C
for 30 s, 2 min at 95°C, and 30 s at 65°C on a hot plate. Afterwards,
wafers were developed in propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate
for ~90 s. Then wafers were incubated in isopropanol for another 1
min, before air drying. Lastly the wafers were incubated with silane in
vacuum overnight. This etched surface was then used as a “master”
form onto which liquid polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) silicon rubber
is cast and allowed to cross-link. Specifically, a disposable plastic cup
was filled with Sylgard 184 silicone elastomer base, and the curing
agent had a 10:1 weight ratio. The solution was poured onto the
fabricated wafer and degassed to remove air bubbles. The solution
was cured at 65°C for 4 h. The cured PDMS was removed from the
wafer, and the desired patterns were laser cut from the PDMS. The
resulting stamp masks were washed in isopropanol and sonicated in
ethanol before use.
Multielectrode Array Recording of Neuronal Electrical Activity
Preparing multielectrode arrays for neuronal culture. Multielec-
trode arrays (MEAs) (Multichannel Systems, Germany) were washed
for 24 h in 1% Tergezyme (Alconox, White Plains, NY) and another
24 h in deionized H2O. Afterwards, MEAs were dried and UVOzone
treated (UVO Cleaner model NO 342, Jelight Company, Irvine, CA)
for 7 min. Then the MEAs were incubated with 100 �g/ml PLL
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 1 h and washed three times with sterile
PBS (GIBCO Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Cells were
seeded at the desired density and cultured under standard conditions at
37°C and 5% CO2. Media was replaced by removing one-half and
adding fresh media every 72 h until experiments were performed.
Recording. Neuronal cultures were grown on 60MEA200/30iR-
ITO for up to 20 days. Once neuronal cultures exhibited robust
spontaneous firing activity, they were considered “mature” (Cullen et
al. 2010; Hinard et al. 2012). Our neurons started firing around day 10
in culture and established a robust spontaneous firing activity after 14
days in vitro (DIV) and maintained this robust firing activity for
several weeks. The MEAs were recorded with the MEA2100 (Mul-
tichannel Systems, Reutlingen, Germany) using the MC_Rack soft-
ware. Spontaneous action potential discharge activity was recorded
with a sampling rate of 25 kHz for 5 min.
Analysis. The recorded traces were analyzed using MC_Rack
software (Multichannel Systems). All data streams were 125-Hz
Bessel fourth-order high-pass filtered and 50-Hz Bessel fourth-order
band-pass filtered. Spike detection was performed with a threshold
of 5 SD difference from noise. Quantification of recordings was
done with NeuroExplorer to extract interspike intervals, frequency,
bursts, etc. Matlab (MATLAB 8.0 and Statistics Toolbox 8.1, The
MathWorks, Natick, MA) was used to generate raster plots.
Microcontact Printing
Washed and sterilized stamp masks were air-dried under sterile
conditions and incubated with a PLL and laminin (both Sigma, St.
Louis, MO) solution (100 �g/ml PLL and 25 �g/ml laminin) for 1 h.
Afterwards, the stamp masks were lowered onto sterile coverslips or
MEAs and gently attached to the surface. The holes of the stamp
masks were filled with PLL and incubated for 1 h. Afterwards PLL
was removed, and holes were washed with PBS three times before
cells were seeded at the desired density (also see Fig. 7). One hour
after seeding, masks were removed, and coverslips or MEAs were
gently washed with HABG (as described above).
PCP Experiments
Phencyclidine hydrochloride (PCP; P3029, Sigma, St. Louis, MO)
was reconstituted in H2O as a stock solution of 5 mg/ml. Neuronal
cultures were dosed either with 5 �M 1 h after seeding for 24 h or
with 10 �M or 25 �M at 12 DIV. If cells were dosed with PCP at 1 h

 after seeding, spontaneous electrical activity was measured at DIV 11
until DIV 20 daily. If PCP was added to DIV 12 cultures, electrical
activity was measured before the addition of PCP, as well as at several
time points after PCP addition (3 h, 6 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 96 h, 120 h).
Electrical activity was measured 5 min for each time point or day (see
also Multielectrode Array Recording of Neuronal Electrical Activity
above). Dosing regimens for DIV 12 cells were chosen in accordance
with procedures described previously (Adachi et al. 2013). A lower
PCP concentration was used for the 1-h time point due to the
sensitivity of freshly isolated neurons to external factors.
Numbers of Samples
The number of samples is as follows: cell composition separately
seeded cultures (n � 2–4 coverslips, 8–20 images); protein expres-
sion (n � 1); metabolic activity (n � 3–7 plates, 60–140 wells);
electrophysiology (n � 3 MEAs/brain region, 60 electrodes each,
5-min recording each); brain-on-a-chip cell composition (n � 4
coverslips, 20–54 images); brain-on-a-chip electrophysiology (n � 3
MEAs, 6–20 electrodes, 5-min recordings); and PCP experiments
(n � 4–5 MEAs/per condition, 8–20 electrodes/MEA, 5-min record-
ings).
Statistics
Multifactorial one-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni post hoc test
was used to statistically analyze results. One-way ANOVA tests
together with Bonferroni post hoc tests were conducted for statistical
comparisons as our data consist of a single dependent variable (e.g.,
number of cells) and multiple independent variables (e.g., multiple
brain regions, multiple cell type-specific markers). The ANOVA test
was chosen over the two-tailed Student’s t-test because multiple
t-tests cannot be performed on different conditions without inflating
type 1 errors. All values depicted in Table 1 are P values resulting
from the second step Bonferroni post hoc test.
RESULTS
To comparatively evaluate cells from different brain regions
in vitro, we analyzed the cell composition, protein expression
levels, metabolism, and electrical activity of neuronal cultures
from the pfCx, Hip, and Amy (Fig. 1). As a next step, we
introduced a novel multiregional brain-on-a-chip model, which
consists of three locally separated areas with cells from the
pfCx, Hip, and Amy. The areas containing the cell bodies are
physically separated, but the areas are functionally connected
through axons. The cell composition and electrical activity of
neuronal cultures, which were cultured separately, were com-
pared with the multiregional brain-on-a-chip (Fig. 1). Further-
more, we introduced the possible application of the brain-on-
a-chip model to treat brain regions separately with a drug and
subsequently analyze the effect on all interconnected regions in
vitro (not depicted in Fig. 1).
Neuronal and Glial Markers In Vitro Are Expressed in a
Brain Region Dependent Manner
Astrocytes and neurons are the main cell types in the brain,
and their amounts differ in a brain region-dependent manner in
vivo. Furthermore, neurons come in different types, including
different morphology, function, and neurotransmitter prefer-
ence (Herculano-Houzel 2009; Kandel et al. 2000). To eluci-
date whether cell composition in vitro differs in a brain
region-dependent manner, we cultured brain cells isolated from
the neonate rat pfCx, Hip, and Amy separately for 14 days.
After 14 DIV, cells were fixed and immunostained for various
brain relevant markers: GFAP (astrocytes), GAD (GABAergic
neurons), and Vglut (glutamatergic neurons). The abundance
of these markers was assessed and quantified for each culture
(Fig. 2). Figure 2, A–J, depicts example images from each
brain region in vitro and for each marker used. Moreover, the
number of cells that were positive for GFAP, GAD, and Vglut
was quantified and normalized to the total number of cells (Fig.
2J). Cells from the pfCx and the Hip were similar in their
amount of the analyzed markers, with around 30% percent of
the culture being GFAP-positive cells, 18–22% being Vglut-
positive, and the lowest number (13–15%) being GAD-posi-
tive. Cells from the Amy, however, showed a very different
marker distribution compared with pfCx and Hip cells. A small
proportion of the cultured cells (around 23%) were GFAP
positive. GAD-positive cells accounted for ~28% of the cell
population, and Vglut-positive cells around 33% (Fig. 2J). To
investigate whether the differences between brain regions for
the markers assessed were significant, one-way ANOVA (post
hoc test: Bonferroni) was performed, and significance levels
are shown in Table 1. While each culture exhibited a unique
cell composition profile, the largest differences were observed
between the pfCx and the Amy cultures, as well as between
Hip and Amy cultures (Table 1, asterisk � signifcant, no
asterisk � not significant). Overall, these results suggest that
the expression and distribution of neuronal and glial markers in
vitro is highly dependent on the brain region from which the
cells originated.
Protein Expression In Vitro Is Brain Region Dependent
Protein expression levels of cells isolated from the pfCx,
Hip, and Amy were measured using mass spectrometry, and all
samples were normalized to neonate pfCx tissue. GEDI anal-
ysis was performed (Eichler et al. 2003) on all samples to
create visual representations of the global expression profiles
and compare the differences between the pfCx, Hip, and Amy
neuron populations (Fig. 3, A–D). The protein allocation map
for the GEDI mosaics shows how the software assigns proteins
to each square based on a SOM algorithm trained using the fold
change values from the mass spectrometry measurements (Fig.
3D). Neuronal cultures from the Hip and the Amy exhibited
overall similar protein expression profiles, whereas clear dif-
ferences were observed between these regions to the pfCx,

 which seems to exhibit a similar protein expression profile as
the neonate pfCx (Fig. 3, A–C).
Pearson correlation analysis allowed us to quantify the
degree of difference between the protein expression profiles of
the pfCx, Hip, and Amy populations. These results revealed a
linear correlation (r � 0.80) in the expression values between
each pairwise comparison of the cell types (Fig. 3, E–G). The
strongest correlation was observed between the Amy and
Hip expression profiles (Fig. 3E), whereas the Amy and Hip
expression profiles both exhibited less correlation to the
pfCx expression profile. Taken together with the GEDI
mosaics, these results suggest that the Amy and Hip neuron
populations exhibit proteomes with a distinct subpopulation
of proteins corresponding to a biological component or
process that is highly expressed in these cells, but not in the
pfCx population.
To identify the biological processes associated with dif-
ferentially expressed proteins between the pfCx, Hip, and
Amy neuron populations, we subjected the proteins exhib-
iting a twofold change or greater expression level to pro-
teomaps analysis (Liebermeister et al. 2014). These maps

 the proteins identified in the expression data and organize
them according to a Voronoi diagram to facilitate easy
distinction of major biological process groups and their
related subgroups (Fig. 3, H–K). The proteomaps for the
pfCx, Hip, and Amy cultures show that proteins associated
with transcription/translation (i.e., blue areas of the map)
and metabolism (i.e., yellow-brown areas of the map) ac-
count for the majority of the proteome for these cells, with
subtle differences in distinct brain regions in the expression
levels of proteins associated with these biological process
groups. The animated proteomaps (Supplemental Movies
S1–S3; supplemental material for this article is available
online at the journal website) further show the hierarchy of
the biological processes in increasing amount of detail (see
also Supplemental Tables S1–S3). Taken together, these
results show that the in vitro protein expression profiles for
the pfCx, Hip, and Amy exhibit a large degree of similarity,
but that subtle differences observed in the expression pat-
terns may reveal unique underlying biological processes that
distinguish these brain regions in vitro.

A NOVEL MULTIREGIONAL BRAIN-ON-A-CHIP
J Neurophysiol • doi:10.1152/jn.00575.2016 • www.jn.org

 While a substantial proportion of the proteins in the mass
spectrometry data set exhibited similar expression values
across the pfCx, Hip, and Amy cultures, PCA enabled us to
identify proteins associated with the greatest variance in ex-
pression levels between the different brain regions (Fig. 4A).
The results of the PCA analysis were projected into the two
dimensions associated with the greatest variability in the ex-
pression data set and plotted on a scatterplot, with each point
color coded to represent the top level gene ontology biological
process associated with the corresponding protein (listed in the
legend of Fig. 4A). By sorting the proteins in the mass spec-
trometry data set according to the magnitudes of the first and
second principal components, we were able to identify the set
of proteins that exhibited the greatest differences in expression
between the pfCx, Hip, and Amy neuronal cultures, examples
of which are listed in Table 2. We sought to determine whether
any of these differentially expressed proteins were associated
with cellular components or signaling pathways that may shed
light on the functional differences observed in the pfCx, Hip,
and Amy neuron populations. Thus the mass spectrometry data
from these three neuronal populations were subjected to IPA to
identify protein interaction networks wherein proteins from our
data set were highly represented. The IPA software used
z-score analysis to identify and rank the pathways represented
in the expression data set, and the top 13 most representative
networks are illustrated in Fig. 4B. These networks were
largely associated with cytoskeletal signaling and axonal
growth, and the z-scores indicate that the pfCx population
demonstrated a distinct profile vs. the Hip and Amy popula-
tions, which exhibited similar profiles for all of the highly
represented pathways shown.
To obtain a more detailed idea about the changes and
similarities in protein expression between the different brain
regions, we used the protein-protein interaction network anal-
ysis software STRING (Szklarczyk et al. 2015) to create
protein-protein interaction networks from the set of proteins
that demonstrated the greatest and least variance between the
pfCx, Hip, and Amy neuron cultures as determined from the
PCA (Fig. 4C). The length of the edges between each pair of
protein nodes in the protein-protein interaction networks was
computed using a spring-like model to cluster higher confi-
dence protein-protein interactions closer together into function-
ally-related clusters. We found that interaction networks cor-
responding to NF assembly and glutathione metabolism (Fig.
4C, top) were present in the set of proteins showing the greatest
variance between the three brain regions examined. In contrast,
interaction networks associated with the SNARE (soluble N-
ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein re-
ceptors) complex and synaptic vesicle cycling (Fig. 4C, bot-
tom) were among the proteins exhibiting similar expression
levels across the pfCx, Hip, and Amy neuron cultures. Inter-
estingly, the proteins that are involved in NF assembly and
glutathione metabolism appear to be differentially expressed in
a brain region-dependent manner. This suggests a difference in
brain region neuronal activity pattern, which in turn may result
in less reactive oxygen species (ROS) and less need for
glutathione. Conversely, proteins involved in the SNARE com-
plex and synaptic vesicle cycling appear to show similar
expression levels between the pfCx, Hip, and Amy cultures, as
expected, considering that synaptic vesicle transmission of
neurotransmitters is a fundamental aspect of neuron function.
Although not the focus of this study, we depicted a brief
example list of protein expression levels comparing in vitro vs.
in vivo, i.e., comparing pfCx, Hip, and Amy cells in vitro vs.
pfCx, Hip, and Amy neonate and adult rat tissue (Table 3). As
expected, differences between cells and tissue become obvious
either in a difference of expression levels, e.g., for protein
S100a13 or apolipoprotein B-100, or in the lack of proteins in
either tissue or in vitro system, e.g., glutathione S-transferase
�-3, aquaporin-1, or parvalbumin-� (Table 3). Sometimes,
proteins were expressed as different isoforms or subunits in
either in vitro system or tissue, e.g., Parp9 was expressed in
cells, but not in tissue samples, whereas Parp14 was expressed
in tissue, but not in vitro (Table 3). Depending on the study to
be conducted, the expression (or the lack thereof) of the
protein(s) of interest should be evaluated carefully. A similar
study was conducted previously, comparing extracellular ma-
trix proteins in rat tissue from different brain regions and cells
in vitro of the same brain areas, finding differences in the
expression of these proteins in a brain region- and system-
dependent manner (Dauth et al. 2016).
Metabolism In Vitro Is Brain Region Dependent
The energy within cells is mainly produced by the mitochon-
dria as part of the respiration process, and it is characterized by
different parameters, such as ATP production, basal respira-
tion, proton leak, in addition to nonmitochondrial respiration.
Moreover, the cells’ metabolism is directly coupled to other
cell functions, including, but not limited to, electrical activ-
ity, cell growth, and cell proliferation (Cherry et al. 2016).
Metabolism of neuronal cultures from different brain re-
gions was analyzed by measuring the OCR (Fig. 5). Basal
respiration, proton leak, ATP production, and nonmitochon-
drial respiration were significantly different in Amy cultures
compared with cultures from the pfCx and the Hip. More
specifically, basal respiration was the same in pfCx and Hip
cultures, but three times lower in the Amy cells. Further-
more, the proton leak was highest in Hip cultures (20
pmol/min), slightly lower in pfCx cultures (12.5 pmol/min),
Fig. 3. Protein expression analyses of different brain regions in vitro. Protein expression was measured via mass spectrometry in 14 DIV old neuronal cultures
derived from the prefrontal cortex (pfCx; A), hippocampus (Hip; B), and amygdala (Amy; C), and global protein expression profiles were visualized using gene
expression dynamics inspector (GEDI) software. A self-organizing map algorithm was trained on the data set and used to generate mosaics visualizing the expression
profiles for each brain region, wherein each tile of the mosaic represents a group of proteins with similar expression profiles. Red colored tiles indicate a high-fold
change in protein expression relative to the control (neonate pfCx), whereas blue represents low-fold change. D: proteins were allocated to each tile of the GEDI
mosaic according to their expression profile. Red tiles indicate a large number of assigned proteins, whereas blue colored tiles indicate fewer assigned proteins.
Pearson product-moment correlation was used to assess the linear correlation between the global expression profiles measured for Hip vs. Amy (r � 0.87) (E),
pfCx vs. Amy (r � 0.80) (F), and pfCx vs. Hip (r � 0.86) (G). Proteomaps were used to visualize the KEGG orthology biological process terms associated with
proteins exhibiting twofold or greater expression levels in the pfCx (H), Hip (I), and Amy (J) brain regions using Voronoi diagrams, wherein each polygon
represents an individual protein, and polygon area is a function of expression level. K: the polygons in the proteomaps are subdivided and color coded according
to the top level KEGG orthology biological process terms represented in the protein expression profiles for each brain region.

between brain regions (SNARE complex and synaptic vesicle cycling). The length of the edges between each pair of protein nodes in the protein-protein interaction
networks was computed using a spring-like model to cluster higher confidence protein-protein interactions closer together into functionally-related clusters.

 and significantly lower in the Amy (2.5 pmol/min). ATP
production was similar in cultures from the pfCx and the
Hip, but more than two times lower in Amy cultures. Lastly,
for the nonmitochondrial respiration, a decrease by almost
two times was observed in Amy cultures compared with
pfCx and Hip cells. Overall, all analyzed parameters were
lower in neuronal cells from the Amy, suggesting that these
cells are overall less active in vitro and therefore exhibited
a lower energy demand (Fig. 5), which is well in line with
the observation that especially the expression of glutathione
metabolism proteins, which are needed more in active cells
(Yermolaieva et al. 2000), showed a high variance between
the samples (Fig. 4).
Electrical Activity In Vitro Is Brain Region Dependent
We have shown thus far that cells from different brain
regions cultured in vitro exhibited unique brain region-depen-
dent cell composition, protein expression, and metabolism. We
were further interested in whether in vitro cultures of cells from
different brain regions were inherently different in their elec-
trical activity. Neuronal cells from different brain regions were
cultured on MEAs for 18–21 days, and electrical activity was
recorded. Waveform examples are depicted over 50 s for the
pfCx (Fig. 6A), Hip (Fig. 6C), and Amy (Fig. 6E). The overall
amount of spikes in each region is shown within a raster plot
(Fig. 6, B, D, and F). Each spike is represented by a line. Each

 row represents one electrode. The results indicate that the Amy
cultures exhibit overall significantly less spikes compared with
pfCx and Hip cells. Electrical activity of each region was
analyzed using either a band-pass (50 Hz, Fig. 6G) or high-pass
filter (125 Hz, Fig. 6H) to distinguish between high (signal
from a couple of cells within the network, local) and low
frequencies (field potentials). Results indicated a similar inter-
spike interval for band-pass filtered data for the pfCx and the
Amy, whereas the Hip cultures showed more spikes with
longer interspike intervals (Fig. 6G), showing that the Hip
cultures exhibited more field potentials, which are approxi-
mately 1 s apart from each other. High-pass filtered data
suggested again a similarity between pfCx and Amy cultures,
whereas Hip cultures exhibited more spikes in general (Fig.
6H), correlating well with our observation that overall the
frequency is highest in Hip cells (Fig. 6M). Numbers of spikes
within a 5-min range were observed to be significantly higher
in the Hip compared with the Amy in vitro. A higher number
of spikes were also found in the pfCx compared with the Amy
(Fig. 6I). In a burst, Hip cultures exhibited a longer interspike
interval compared with both the pfCx and the Amy cultures
(Fig. 6J), which correlates well with our findings that field
potentials in the Hip cultures are exhibiting longer intervals
compared with the other two regions (Fig. 6G). Time between
bursts was observed to be highest in Amy cultures compared
with both Hip and pfCx cultures (Fig. 6K). Burst frequency
was observed to be lowest in Hip cultures and highest in pfCx
cultures (Fig. 6L). Hip cultures exhibited the highest overall
frequency, followed by the pfCx and the Amy (Fig. 6M). The
Amy showed the lowest overall frequency, which correlates
well with our findings that Amy cells exhibited the lowest basal
respiration, ATP production, and proton leak (Fig. 5), suggest-
ing an overall lower activity of Amy cells in vitro compared
with pfCx and Hip cultures. Overall, these results suggest that
in vitro electrophysiological features, such as frequency, wave-
form, and interspike intervals, were dependent on the brain
region from which cells were derived, suggesting an intrinsi-
cally different electrophysiological behavior in vitro. Interest-
ingly, there also seems to be a difference between field poten-
tials (network activity, low frequencies) and overall spikes
(high frequencies, signal from a couple of cells within the
network) in a brain region-dependent manner, suggesting the
presence of several communication patterns in vitro, which is
well in line with in vivo results reporting that low frequencies
modulate activity over large spatial regions in long temporal
windows, and that high frequencies modulate activity over
small spatial regions and short temporal windows (Buzsáki and
Draguhn 2004; von Stein and Sarnthein 2000).
A Novel Brain-on-a-Chip Interconnecting Cells from
Different Brain Regions and the Influence on Cell
Composition
In vivo, proper brain function relies on the communication
between different brain regions. Together with our results that
in vitro cells from different brain regions exhibit different
traits, these observations underline the importance of develop-
ing brain in vitro models that recapitulate the complexity of
brain region interactions in vivo and suggest that the presence
of cells from other brain regions and their connections might
have an influence on parameters such as cell composition and
electrophysiology. Therefore, we developed a multiregional
brain-on-a-chip model (Fig. 7), where cells from different brain
regions were seeded in separate compartments, but grew ax-
onal connections and thereby connected to each other (Fig. 7,

 A–E). Briefly, a PDMS mask consisting of three separate
compartments was attached to a coverslip. Cells from each
brain region (pfCx, Hip, Amy) were seeded into each compart-
ment and allowed to adhere to the culture substrate before the
mask was removed. After removal of the PDMS mask, cell
bodies stayed in their area and started extending axons toward
the other cell areas (i.e., toward the other brain regions). After
a few days, axons had grown over the single gap that existed
between the different cell areas and thereby connected the
distinct cell regions (Fig. 7). More details can be found in
MATERIALS AND METHODS.
As previously demonstrated in this study, cells from distinct
brain regions exhibited unique characteristics in vitro. The
multiregional brain-on-a-chip model now enables us to inves-
tigate whether the presence of cells from different brain regions
influences characteristics such as cell composition or electrical
activity in vitro. As was demonstrated in Fig. 2, separately
seeded cells exhibited a different abundance of GFAP, GAD,
and Vglut, depending on from which brain region cells were
derived. The same analysis was performed for our brain-on-a-
chip model for each brain region (Fig. 7, F–Q). Overall, we
observed that the presence of cells from other brain areas in
vitro influences the abundance of various neuronal and non-
neuronal markers as is depicted in Fig. 7, O–Q. Compared with
the separately seeded pfCx cells, within this brain area of the
brain-on-a-chip model we observed 10% less Vglut-positive
cells, about the same amount of GAD-positive cells, and ~5%
less GFAP-positive cells. For the Hip area, we determined
between 2 and 5% more Vglut- and GAD-positive cells, and
~7% less GFAP-positive cells in the brain-on-a-chip model
compared with the separately seeded cells. For the Amy, we
saw 10% less Vglut-positive cells, ~4% less GAD-positive
cells, and almost 10% more GFAP-positive cells in the brain-
on-a-chip model compared with separately seeded cells (Fig. 7,
O–Q). Overall, these results suggest that the cell composition
of these cultures was influenced by the presence of cells from
other brain regions.
The Presence of Cells from Other Brain Regions Influences
Electrical Activity In Vitro
Electrical activity of the multiregional brain-on-a-chip
model was assessed (Fig. 8) in a manner similar to the indi-
vidually seeded cultures previously (Fig. 5). An example of a

 raw MEA signal from one multiregional brain model is shown
in Fig. 8B. Electrodes covered by pfCx cells are outlined in red,
by Hip cells in blue, and by Amy cells in orange (Fig. 8B).
Outline colors correspond to the colors used in Fig. 8A. Within
the multiregional brain-on-a-chip, distinct cell populations ex-
hibited distinct waveforms (Fig. 8B). To test if the distinct cell
populations were communicating with each other, we analyzed
the cross-correlation of their firing activity (Fig. 8C). Red
indicates a high cross-correlation; blue none. We observed a
clear cross-correlation within each population, but also across
distinct populations (Fig. 8C), suggesting that the different cell
populations were communicating with each other. Analyzing
the recordings using a band-pass filter, we observed a distinct
difference in the interspike interval behavior of the Hip cell
Fig. 7. Novel brain-on-a-chip model comprised of different brain regions. A–D: PDMS mask preparation and seeding procedure for brain-on-a-chip model. A:
first an ~1-mm-thick PDMS sheet is laser cut to receive the masks, with 3 wells being 1 mm apart. Line features are engraved on the bottom side of the PDMS
mask. B: the line features are then coated with PLL/laminin and air-dried, before being stamped on a coverslip or a MEA. C: wells are filled with PLL to coat
the coverslip or MEA surface. D: PLL is washed away before cells from the different brain regions are seeded in the separated wells of the mask. One hour after
seeding, masks are removed. Cells will now start growing axons using the microcontact printed PLL/laminin lines as physical cues to connect to the cells from
the other brain regions. E: example image of the in vitro model 14 DIV immunostained for �III tubulin (green) and GFAP (red). Close-up images of axons that
have been grown over the 1-mm gap on the microcontact printed PLL/laminin lines connecting the different brain regions (1, 2). The multiregional
brain-on-a-chip was stained for �III-tubulin (green), GFAP (red), and DAPI as a nuclear counterstain (F–H); for �III tubulin (green), glutamate decarboxylase
1 (GAD1, red), and DAPI (I–K); and for GFAP (green), vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (Vglut, red), and DAPI (L–N). O–Q: quantification of the number

 population, with more spikes having a shorter time period
between them (Fig. 8D). Using a high-pass filter revealed in
general more spikes for the Hip cell population compared with
the other two (Fig. 8E). Raster plots showed similar frequency
of the Hip and pfCx cell populations and a lower frequency of
the Amy cell population (Fig. 8, G, I, and K). Example
waveforms for each cell population are shown in Fig. 8, F, H,
and J. Comparing the number of spikes, we did not find a
significant difference between the cell populations (Fig. 8L).
Interspike intervals appeared to be longer for the Hip compared
with the other two regions (Fig. 8M). Overall frequency and
interburst intervals appeared to be similar between all three cell
populations (Fig. 8, N and O). The frequency in a burst was
significantly higher in the pfCx cell population compared with
both other regions (Fig. 8P). Overall, these results suggest that,
within our multiregional brain-on-a-chip model, different cell
populations were communicating with each other, they exhib-
ited distinct electrophysiological behavior (e.g., waveforms,
interspike interval), and that, compared with the separately
seeded cultures, they altered some of their electrophysiological
behavior (e.g., frequency, interspike intervals). This in turn
suggests that the presence of cells from other brain regions and
their connections influenced electrophysiology in vitro.
Drug Application
The three brain regions that were chosen for the multiregional
brain-on-a-chip, i.e., pfCx, Hip, and Amy, and their connections
are implicated in the disease of schizophrenia (Benes 2010).
Hence, PCP was chosen as a test compound since it has been
shown to induce schizophrenia-like symptoms in healthy individ-
uals and animal models due to its inhibitory action on N-methyl-
D-aspartate receptors (Adachi et al. 2013). One area each of the
multiregional brain model was treated with 5 �M PCP at seeding
(Fig. 9A) and electrical activity was measured daily from DIV 11
until DIV 20. A control sample with no PCP addition was
measured in parallel on the same days (Fig. 9A). Figure 9 shows
example traces of spontaneous electrical activity for the pfCx (Fig.
9B), the Hip (Fig. 9C), and the Amy (Fig. 9D) for DIV 12, DIV
15, and DIV 18. For all samples that were treated with PCP, traces
for the Hip show differences in their amplitude and seem less
regular compared with the control (Fig. 9C). For Amy, the control
shows a higher frequency compared with the dosed conditions
(Fig. 9D). For the pfCx, it seems that, especially when the pfCx
itself was dosed, we observed a higher frequency compared with
the control (Fig. 9A). Differences are also apparent when com-
paring the electrical activity of the same regions for different
dosing conditions. Cortical traces differ in their amplitude and
frequency, depending on which area was dosed with PCP (Fig.
9A). For the Hip, all conditions dosed with PCP show lower
amplitude of the signal compared with the control; moreover, the
frequency appeared to be different between the varying dosing
conditions (Fig. 9C). We further analyzed the overall frequency
and active electrodes of all conditions and brain regions for the
different time points (Fig. 10). The main differences (a higher
frequency) were seen in the Hip when either the Hip itself or the
Amy was dosed. Active electrodes showed an overall increase in
numbers the first few days and then a plateau phase. Numbers of
active electrodes differed the most between regions when PCP
was added to the Hip, but these differences correlated well with
what we saw in the control condition (Fig. 10). Overall, it became
apparent that it matters which brain region was dosed, since the
wave patterns differed depending on which brain region was
treated, underlining the advantage of this model to apply drugs to
individual brain areas separately while analyzing downstream
effects on interconnected regions.
We investigated a separated condition, where cultures of the
multiregional brain-on-a-chip were dosed at DIV 12 with either
10 �M or 25 �M PCP (or no PCP as a control), and electrical
activity was measured before PCP addition and at several time
points thereafter. Frequency generally decreased right after
PCP addition and increased until around 48 h after PCP
addition and decreased again afterwards (Fig. 11). Frequency
was overall higher in the Amy, assuming a different effect of
PCP on Amy connections (inhibitory connections vs. excit-
atory connections). Comparing the example traces, it becomes
apparent that, in the control, the electrical signal became more
mature over time in terms of frequency and amplitude (Fig.
11), whereas this did not happen for the PCP dosed cultures,

 confirming an effect of PCP on electrical activity regarding
amplitude and frequency, which might not become so apparent
when looking at overall frequency only.
DISCUSSION
In vivo, brain regions differ in their structure, function, cell
composition, and other features (Dauth et al. 2016; Herculano-
Houzel 2009; Kandel et al. 2000; Masland 2004; Stevens
1998). In vitro, neurons from different brain regions are com-
monly isolated, but so far studies usually looked at one region
per study only (Lesuisse and Martin 2002; Lorenzo et al. 1992;
Whitson et al. 1989). In turn, differences and similarities of
different brain regions in vitro are still poorly understood.
Cell Composition of Neuronal Cultures Derived from
Different Brain Regions
In vitro, not much is known about whether cells from
distinct brain regions differ with respect to their cell compo-
sition. As our results demonstrated (Fig. 2), cells derived from
distinct brain regions exhibited a different cell composition in
vitro, e.g., altering amounts of astrocytes as well as of gluta-
matergic and GABAergic neurons. Interestingly, when trying
to compare these results to in vivo data, it becomes apparent
that there is a substantial lack of information concerning
quantitative data about neuronal and nonneuronal cell num-
bers. There are some studies available, mainly looking into
neuronal and nonneuronal cell numbers in rodents, primates,
and in humans, focusing on areas like the cortex, the Hip, the
cerebellum, and the olfactory bulb (Bandeira et al. 2009;
Herculano-Houzel 2009; Herculano-Houzel and Lent 2005).
For some brain regions, different types of neurons have been
described (Masland 2004; Stevens 1998), but there are no
quantitative reports on numbers of specific neuronal types
(e.g., glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons). Astrocytes have
been reported to be more abundant in the adult rat cortex and
Hip (no data is available for the Amy), but account for ~1/3 of
the neuronal population in 2-day old rats (Bandeira et al. 2009).
The latter correlates well with our findings for cells that were
cultured individually in vitro for these specific brain regions.
We further see that the amount of specific neuronal types
differed especially in the Amy compared with the other two
brain regions, showing less astrocytes and more GABAergic
and glutamatergic neurons. The main two neuronal types that
have been described in vivo in the Amy are glutamatergic and
GABAergic (Sah et al. 2003), which we also observed in vitro.
Overall, the amount and distribution of neurons and astrocytes
is brain region dependent in vivo, an important feature that
should be kept in mind when evaluating in vitro models of
specific brain regions.
Protein Expression, Metabolism and Electrophysiology of
Neuronal Cultures from Different Brain Regions
While researchers have started mapping the protein expres-
sion of different brain regions of the mouse and rat brain and
are eager to decipher the human brain proteome (Kasukawa et
al. 2011; Katagiri et al. 2010; Martins-de-Souza et al. 2014;
Sharma et al. 2015), in vitro these data are not available.

A NOVEL MULTIREGIONAL BRAIN-ON-A-CHIP

 Deciphering the protein expression in vitro is crucial for better
understanding the cells with which we are working and under-
standing differences and similarities between multiple brain
regions in vitro. It will also possibly increase our knowledge
about how well correlated our in vitro models are to their in
vivo counterpart.
Here, we show that there are differences as well as similar-
ities between neuronal cultures in vitro from different brain
regions. There have been studies reporting the presence of
several proteins in different brain regions in vivo (Katagiri et
al. 2010; Sharma et al. 2015; Taraslia et al. 2013), as well as
one comprehensive quantitative analysis of gene expression in
different brain regions of the mouse brain (Kasukawa et al.
2011). Our analysis revealed several proteins that show a
similar expression between the different cultures, but also
some proteins that show a high variance in protein expression
in a brain region-dependent manner. Examples include proteins
from the MHC class I family of proteins, which show a high
expression in Amy cells and comparably less in the other two
cultures. Other proteins, such as lactotransferrin, is highly
expressed in the Hip in vitro and comparably less in cultures
from the Amy or pfCx. One study has reported differences in
the mRNA levels of proteins involved in the immune function
in microglial cells isolated from different brain regions (Ren et
al. 1999), supporting our findings that cells from different brain
regions show differences in vitro in a brain region-dependent
manner.
As shown in the network analysis (Fig. 4), proteins involved
in either the NF assembly or the glutathione metabolism seem
to be different in their expression levels between the different
samples. The glutathione metabolism is important for several
things, including, but not limited to, antioxidant defense, nu-
trient metabolism, protein synthesis, and signal transduction
(Wu et al. 2004). It has been shown that functionally active
neurons show increased metabolic activity and oxygen con-
sumption, resulting in higher levels of ROS (Yermolaieva et al.
2000). One possible explanation of why high variances partic-
ularly occur in this protein network might be that Amy cells in
vitro are less metabolically and electrically active compared
with cells from the pfCx or the Hip (Figs. 5 and 6) and,
therefore, produce less ROS and exhibit lower expression
levels of proteins involved in glutathione metabolism.

 NFs have been reported to be prominent in large axons,
whereas small unmyelinated axons contain only few NFs, and
some small neurons even lack morphologically identifiable
NFs, suggesting a differential expression of NFs depending on
neuronal morphology (Elder et al. 1998). We here have only
shown that neuronal types are differentially distributed, de-
pending on the brain regions from which the cells were
derived, but have not closely looked at morphological differ-
ences of the neurons. Therefore, it might be possible that
differences in neuronal morphology in the different cultures
leads to a different amount of NFs and in turn to high variances
in proteins involved in NF assembly.
On the other hand, proteins that are involved in the SNARE
complex and the synaptic vesicle cycling exhibit similar ex-
pression levels in all three samples analyzed, suggesting that
these protein networks are functioning in a non-brain region-
dependent manner in vitro. In exocytosis and neurosecretion,
SNARE and associated proteins (including proteins involved in
synaptic vesicle cycling) play a critical role in vesicle docking,
priming, fusion, and synchronization of neurotransmitter re-
lease, which is triggered by action potentials, and inherent to
most neurons (Hu et al. 2002; Ramakrishnan et al. 2012;
Sudhof 2004). Therefore, it is reasonable that cells derived
from different brain regions express proteins involved in these
events in similar levels.
Another interesting finding is that most of the proteins that
show a twofold or higher expression change compared with the
control belong to the metabolic process group. Consequently,
we were also interested in whether the metabolic activity of
cells from different brain regions differs in vitro. Therefore, we
analyzed the OCR of our cultures and found that cells from the
Amy had the lowest OCR compared with both other regions,
suggesting a lower metabolic activity of these cells in vitro.
Generally, it has been reported that increased synaptic signal-
ing between neurons leads to higher energy consumption
(Karbowski 2007). In vivo, the performance of different cog-
nitive tasks (e.g., learning, fear conditioning) dictates the
metabolic activity of involved brain regions (Knight et al.
2004; Linnman et al. 2012). Furthermore, alterations in meta-
bolic activity in the Amy have been associated with psychiatric
disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (Shin et al.
2009). It has also been observed that the lateral Amy exhibits
low levels of spontaneous activity in vivo, suggesting a lower
energy demand (Sah et al. 2003). These results correlate well
with our observations that cells from the Amy exhibit a lower
metabolic activity as well as a lower overall frequency of
spontaneous activity in vitro. Common in vivo oscillations,
such as slow oscillations (�1 Hz), �- (1–4 Hz), �- (4–8 Hz),
�- (8–12 Hz), �- (12–30 Hz), and �-bands (�30 Hz) have been
reported in vitro too, mainly analyzed in cortical slices
(Canolty and Knight 2010). Neighboring frequency bands
within the same neuronal network are typically associated with
different brain states, but several rhythms can temporally
coexist in the same or different structures and interact with
each other (Buzsáki and Draguhn 2004; Penn et al. 2016).
Interestingly, different frequencies provide distinct temporal
windows for processing, whereas different rhythms are asso-
ciated with different spatial scales and therefore different cell
population sizes (Canolty and Knight 2010). It has been sug-
gested that low frequencies modulate activity over large spatial
regions in long temporal windows, and that high frequencies
modulate activity over small spatial regions and short temporal
windows (von Stein and Sarnthein 2000). Our results indicate
overall slow oscillations around 1 Hz and lower in neuronal
cultures from all brain regions. Intracellular recordings from
cortical neurons in cats identified slow oscillations (0.16–0.3
Hz), in addition to �-oscillations (1–4 Hz), a finding replicated
in humans at the electroencephalogram level (Achermann and
Borbély 1997; Hinard et al. 2012), and well in line with our in
vitro observations. Besides the slow oscillations, we also ob-
served high-frequency burst activity in our neuronal cultures in
a brain region-dependent manner (pfCx ~55 Hz, Hip ~25 Hz,
Amy ~45 Hz). In vitro studies on brain slices have also
reported low-� (30–80 Hz) and high-� activity (80–200 Hz),
where low-� activity arises mainly from interactions within the
highly interconnected GABAergic (inhibitory) interneuron net-
work, as well as from network interactions between popula-
tions of (excitatory) pyramidal cells and local interneuron
network (Canolty and Knight 2010; Freeman 1950), suggesting
the presence of these networks in our in vitro cultures.
Going a step further, differences between cells and tissue
become obvious either in a difference of expression levels, e.g.,
for protein S100a13 or apolipoprotein B-100, or in the lack of
proteins in either tissue or in vitro system, e.g., glutathione
S-transferase �-3, aquaporin-1, or parvalbumin-� (Table 3).
Sometimes, proteins were expressed as different isoforms or
subunits in either in vitro system or tissue, e.g., Parp9 was
expressed in cells, but not in tissue samples, whereas Parp14
was expressed in tissue, but not in vitro (Table 3). Depending
on the study to be conducted, the expression (or the lack
thereof) of the protein(s) of interest should be evaluated care-
fully. A similar study has been conducted previously, compar-
ing extracellular matrix proteins in rat tissue from different
brain regions and cells in vitro of the same brain areas, finding
differences in the expression of these proteins in a brain region-
and system-dependent manner (Dauth et al. 2016).
Multiregional Brain-on-a-Chip Model
In vivo the brain consists of different brain regions, and the
connection and communication thereof is essential for proper
brain function (Kandel et al. 2000). Current cell in vitro models
in neuroscience allow fine observation of cell phenotypes but
lack the highly ordered connectivity of neurons in the brain.
While in vivo studies are evidently realistic regarding neuronal
architectures, the study of molecular and cellular mechanisms
remains a challenge. In contrast, in vitro studies allow molec-
ular and cellular investigation, but so far lacked the physiolog-
ically realistic connectivity. The in vitro model introduced in
this study reconciles these two concerns by implementing cells
from different brain regions and highly ordered axonal con-
nections. In light of obvious differences of neuronal cells from
distinct brain regions in vitro, as shown in this study, the
importance of developing multiregional brain in vitro models
becomes even more apparent.
Organotypic cultures of single brain areas, such as the Hip,
are used frequently and offer the possibility for easy gene
manipulation and precise pharmacological intervention but
maintain synaptic organization that is critical to understand
synapse function in a more naturalistic context than routine in
vitro systems (Opitz-Araya and Barria 2011). Brain organoids
have also been introduced in recent years, serving as another

A NOVEL MULTIREGIONAL BRAIN-ON-A-CHIP

 potential in vitro model with the advantage of having patient-
specific genetic backgrounds by using iPSCs (Lancaster et al.
2013). Currently, brain organoids are restricted to recapitulat-
ing some of the brain features (some structures of the forebrain,
hypothalamic structures, midbrain), but organoid studies also
support the notion of the importance and necessity to develop
in vitro models that consist of different brain regions (Qian et
al. 2016). These organoids have their own disadvantages,
including but not limited to, the following: 1) size limitations
due to a lack of a circulatory system and therefore limitations
in oxygen and nutrient exchange (Lancaster et al. 2013); 2) due
to the dramatic cortical plate-like structure expansion, progen-
itor zones in forebrain organoids become gradually depleted
after day 100, resulting in problems recapitulating brain devel-
opment beyond the second trimester; 3) more detailed but
important structures of the cortical regions, such as the inter-
mediate zone, the subplate, or the six cortical layers, cannot yet
be recapitulated (Qian et al. 2016; Shuler and Hickman 2014);
and 4) functional assessments are restricted at the moment to
patch-clamp experiments, measuring one cell at a time, thus
making it hard to analyze overall network functionality. These
limitations will probably be addressed for future studies and do
not minimize the big advantages of these in vitro models.
Apart from the just discussed organoids, only very few in
vitro models have been introduced so far which implement
cells from distinct brain regions. A study by Kato-Negishi
(2013) introduced millimeter-sized neural building blocks
formed by cells isolated from the rat Hip and cortex, thereby
reporting a three-dimensional in vitro model implementing
cells from two different brain regions. In another study, axon
diodes have been introduced by another group for the recon-
struction of oriented neuronal networks in microfluidic cham-
bers. The two-chambered microfluidic device was used to
culture neurons from the cortex and the striatum and let them
connect through controlled and highly ordered axons (Peyrin et
al. 2011). Our in vitro model works along those lines, also
producing highly ordered and controlled axonal connections,
but through a different method. Instead of building a whole
microfluidic device, which can be tedious to manufacture, we
use micro-contact printing to introduce physical features to
control axonal growth. To our knowledge, this presents the first
multiregional brain in vitro model implementing three brain
areas. We here show that we are able to produce not only
highly ordered axonal connection, but also connections that are
functionally active. The electrical activity of the different brain
areas is highly cross-correlated, suggesting a functional com-
munication between the distinct regions. Interestingly, the cell
composition of the different brain areas of the multiregional-
on-a-chip model is different compared with when the regions
were seeded separately, suggesting that the presence of cells
from different brain areas (and their connection) has an influ-
ence on cell composition in vitro. This might be due to specific
secreted factors by cells from different brain regions that are
used for communication between the different brain areas. It
would be an interesting follow-up study to assess if cells from
different brain regions secrete a different set of factors and
whether these secreted factors can alter cell composition and
other parameters when added to a different set of cells (from a
different brain area). It would further be interesting to see if a
changed cell composition can also be achieved by seeding the
same brain area cells (e.g., only Hip cells) in all three com-
partments of the mask. If a change would occur, the spatial
separation and the necessity of longer distance axonal growth
compared with separately seeded cells might play a role. In
addition to an altered cell composition, we also observed a
slightly different electrophysiological behavior compared with
when the regions were seeded separately. The overall fre-
quency is slightly lower in the multiregional brain in vitro
model and so is the frequency in a burst. Differences were also
observed regarding the interspike interval, which is much
higher in the multiregional-on-a-chip model for cells isolated
from the pfCx and the Amy compared with when the regions
were seeded separately. These results correlate well with a
recent study showing that the overall frequency of networks is
an average of all the frequency within this network and can be
changed (Penn et al. 2016). Therefore, by connecting cells with
different electrical properties (pfCx, Hip, Amy), the network
dynamic can be changed. Interestingly, the wave pattern is
highly brain region dependent in both conditions.
Applications for this multiregional brain-on-a-chip model
are manifold. In this work, we presented just one example
demonstrating one of the strengths and the uniqueness of this
in vitro model. Brain regions can be dosed with a particular
drug or agent separately from each other. We here dose either
of the three brain regions with 5 �M PCP at seeding. The three
brain regions that were chosen for this in vitro model, the pfCx,
the Hip, and the Amy, and their connections are implicated in
the disease of schizophrenia (Benes 2010). Hence, PCP was
chosen since it has been shown to induce schizophrenia-like
symptoms in healthy individual and animal models due to its
inhibitory action on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (Adachi et
al. 2013). Analyzing example traces of mature networks that
were dosed with PCP (as well as the quantification of overall
frequency thereof), it becomes apparent that it matters which
brain region was dosed, since the wave pattern differs, depend-
ing on which brain region was dosed. Alterations in electrical
activity have been reported in vivo due to psychological
disorders, such as schizophrenia or anxiety disorders (Bitani-
hirwe et al. 2016). We here do not intend to replicate schizo-
phrenia in vitro: we just want to exemplify a possible applica-
tion of our in vitro model for possible disease and drug
assessments. Another possibility of disease modeling and as-
sessment is to dose mature cultures with different concentra-
tions and analyze the effect on the three interconnected brain
areas. Here, we see that PCP in different concentrations has a
slightly different effect on the Amy compared with the other
two areas. All brain regions, when dosed with PCP at a more
mature state, show alterations in their electrical activity wave
pattern compared with the control, which was not dosed with
PCP, suggesting an effect of PCP on the electrophysiological
behavior of all three brain regions, which might not be appar-
ent when looking at overall frequency.
Conclusion
Overall, we present a comprehensive comparison between
cells in vitro derived from different brain regions. Our results
revealed that, while a lot of similarities exist between these
cells, they are inherently different in a brain region-dependent
manner. Moreover, we introduced a multiregional brain-on-a-
chip model implementing essential in vivo features, which will
enable us to develop unique brain disease models. The appli-

 cation example given in this study only represents a very small
fraction of the potential applications of the multiregional brain-
on-a-chip model. For instance, more complex networks, in-
volving different brain areas or more than three will be possible
in the future. Furthermore, this system is also a valuable tool to
address developmental issues, such as the dynamics of neural
networks and synapse formation and the effect of cells from
different brain areas on that matter, and to test biological
hypotheses regarding, e.g., neuron maturation and communi-
cation. In the future, when iPSCs are reproducibly able to
generate brain cells with a specific brain region identity (e.g.,
pfCx, Hip, Amy), this model can be used as a human in vitro
model, making it even more valuable for the study of brain
diseases.
