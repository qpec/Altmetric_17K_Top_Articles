Objective: To extend previous literature that suggests higher IQ in youth is associated with living longer.
Previous studies have been unable to assess reliably whether the effect differs across sexes and ages of death, and
whether the effect is graded across different levels of IQ.
Methods: We test IQ-survival associations in 94% of the near-entire population born in Scotland in 1936 who
took an IQ test at age 11 (n = 70,805) and were traced in a 68-year follow-up.
Results: Higher IQ at age 11 years was associated with a lower risk of death (HR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.79, 0.81).
The decline in risk across categories of IQ scores was graded across the full range with the effect slightly stronger
in women (HR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.77, 0.80) than in men (HR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.81, 0.84). Higher IQ had a
significantly stronger association with death before and including age 65 (HR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.74, 0.77)
than in those participants who died at an older age (HR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.78, 0.80).
Conclusions: Higher childhood IQ is associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality in both men and women.
This is the only near-entire population study to date that examines the association between childhood IQ and
mortality across most of the human life course.
1. Introduction
It is now well-documented that higher childhood intelligence, as
ascertained from standard tests, is associated with living longer. This is
the case for both all-cause mortality (Batty et al., 2008b; Batty et al.,
2009b; Hart et al., 2005; Whalley & Deary, 2001), and mortality from
specific causes, particularly cardiovascular disease, (Batty et al., 2008a;
Deary,
Weiss, & Batty,
2010;
Hemmingsson,
Melin,
Allebeck, & Lundberg,
2009),
accidents
(Batty,
Gale,
Tynelius,
Deary, & Rasmussen, 2009) and suicide (Batty et al., 2010; Gunnell,
Magnusson, & Rasmussen, 2005). The most recent meta-analysis re-
ported that a one standard deviation advantage in early life cognitive
ability test scores is related to a 24% reduction in the risk of death
during a follow-up of up to 69 years (Calvin et al., 2011). However, a
number of questions regarding the associations between IQ and
mortality remain under-explored. Most notably, with many samples
either comprising only men (Batty et al., 2008a; Batty et al., 2009b;
Hemmingsson et al., 2009), or being insufficiently powered to compute
sex-specific effect estimates (Calvin et al., 2011), little is known about
the link between pre-adult IQ and mortality in women. In one of the few
exceptions, Whalley and Deary (Whalley & Deary, 2001) reported a
stronger protective association of higher IQ and lower mortality in
women, but could not rule out that this difference was cohort-specific
due to a larger number of higher intelligence men dying in active
service in the second world war. One report from a post-war cohort
study did not detect an association between IQ and mortality in women
(Kuh, Richards, Hardy, Butterworth, & Wadsworth, 2004), and the
other one detected the association between IQ and mortality only at
the age of 60 and above (Lager, Bremberg, & Vågerö, 2009).
Another important issue concerns the nature of the association
between IQ and mortality. Whereas some studies showed that the
association is graded across the whole range of IQ (Batty et al., 2009b;
Hemmingsson et al., 2009; Whalley & Deary, 2001), others reported
that it is driven by the accumulation of risk factors at the lower end of
the IQ distribution (Kuh et al., 2004). Furthermore, higher childhood IQ
may be protective against early deaths, but may not be associated with
deaths in older age, as was found in one study (Hart et al., 2005).
However, these studies were underpowered to reliably assess the
associations across the whole range of cognitive ability, ages of death,
and to examine potential sex differences in the IQ-mortality association.

MARK
 In the present study we were able to address all of the above
limitations. The data for our study are a near-entire year of birth cohort
from Scotland, with a long period of follow-up and a large number of
deaths. We assessed the association between childhood IQ and survival
to age 79, whether the relationship is graded, and also if there was any
differential effect with respect to sex.
2. Method
2.1. Sample
On June 4, 1947 almost all individuals born in 1936 and attending
Scottish schools sat an intelligence test as part of the Scottish Mental
Survey 1947 (SMS1947). Testing was conducted by the Scottish Council
for Research in Education with an aim to assess the intelligence levels of
the entire generation of children born in 1936 and attending schools in
Scotland in June 1947, as part of a project to follow cross-generational
changes in mean intelligence levels (Deary, Whalley, & Starr, 2009a;
Maxwell, 1969). Intelligence test scores, from a paper-and-pencil test
administered by teachers, were obtained for 70,805 children (50.6%
boys). This was about 94% of the estimated 1936-born population of
Scotland (n = 75,286). The remaining 6% or so did not attend school
on the day of testing.
To ascertain mortality information for the whole year of birth,
tracing was done using the National Health Service Central Register
(NHSCR) in Dumfries for participants traceable in Scotland and
Northern Ireland, and Health and Social Care Information Centre
(HSCIC) in Southport for those traceable in England and Wales.
Tracing was conducted using participants' date of birth, surname,
forename, sex, and name and location of school.
Vital status and death registration data were linked to participants
with complete SMS1947 intelligence test scores. Intelligence test results
and vital status data were available for 66,616 participants (51% men).
That is, 94% of those who took part in the Scottish Mental Survey 1947
were traced and had childhood intelligence test data. A flow chart
representing sample composition is presented in Fig. 1. Ethical approval
for the study was obtained from Scotland A Research Ethics Committee
(12-SS-0024). Support for linkage without consent was given under
section 251 of the NHS Act 2006 by The Confidentiality Advisory Group
of the Health Research Authority for participants traced in England and
Wales (Ref. ECC 6-02(FT4 2012)), and by the Privacy Advisory

2.2. Measures
2.2.1. Childhood intelligence
To assess childhood intelligence at age 11, the Moray House Test
(MHT) no. 12. was used (Deary, Gow, Pattie, & Starr, 2012; Deary,
Whalley, & Starr, 2009b; Deary, Whiteman, Starr, Whalley, & Fox,
2004). The test contains 71 items, including reasoning, word classifica-
tion, analogies, and spatial orientation, and had a maximum possible
score on the test of 76. The test was group-administered by teachers in
classrooms and had a time constraint of 45 min. The MHT was
concurrently validated in 1947 against the Terman-Merrill revision of
the Binet scales (Deary et al., 2007). It has been well externally-
validated since, and is a reliable measure of general intelligence (Deary
et al., 2004; Deary et al., 2012) that shows high rank-order stability
across the life-span (Deary, Whalley, Lemmon, Crawford, & Starr,
2000).
2.2.2. Date of death
Vital status and date of death, where appropriate, were supplied by
NHSCR Dumfries for participants traced in Scotland and Northern
Ireland, and by HSCIC Southport for those located in England and
Wales.
2.3. Analyses
The time-to-event variable (in days) was calculated using the
participant's date of birth as a starting point. The censoring date is
the date of the event that marks the end of the time-to-event variable,
and it differs across participants as follows: for those known to be alive
in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland censoring date was
26th June 2015 (end of follow-up). For those embarked (i.e. emigrated
abroad), joined the Armed Forces and never re-registered with a general
practitioner (GP), or otherwise lost to follow-up (i.e., cancelled their
registration with a GP), the last known date of registration with a GP
was used. For the deceased participants with known date of death, date
of death is used as the end point of the time-to-event variable. For the
deceased participants with an unknown date of death, the date of the
last known GP registration was used as a censoring date. The exact
number of participants for each of the categories is given in Fig. 1. Cox
proportional hazard models were used to assess mortality risk asso-
ciated with childhood IQ scores, controlling for age at the time of IQ
testing. Hazard Ratios (HRs) were shown to illustrate change in risk
both per 1-SD increase in IQ scores, and per IQ decile increase, and
therefore are a relative measure of mortality risk. In all analyses, the
lowest IQ category serves as a reference for the change in mortality risk.
All analyses were computed in R environment, version 3.1.3 (R Core
Team, 2015), using the ‘survival’ package (Therneau, 2015).

 3. Results
Data from 66,616 people were included in the analysis. This is
88.5% of everyone born in Scotland in 1936, and 94.1% of those who
took part in the SMS1947. Of these, 33,956 (51%) were men. A 68-year
follow-up gave rise to 25,460 deaths (16,220 in men). Mean unadjusted
childhood MHT scores for alive, deceased, and untraced participants
are given in Table 1. In the whole sample, and in men and women
separately, the deceased group had lower intelligence test scores than
the group still alive, and the untraced group had the highest mean
score.
Higher childhood IQ (MHT) scores were associated with a lower risk
of death by age 79 (HR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.79, 0.81; Table 2). In the
first model, we included age at IQ testing and IQ test score. In the next
model, we controlled for the effects of sex. The association between
childhood IQ and mortality remained significant, and similar in
magnitude (HR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.80, 0.82). As expected, women
had lower mortality risk.
In the next step, we focused on possible sex differences in the IQ-
mortality associations. As shown in Table 2, the association of higher IQ
(per 1-SD increase) with lower mortality was slightly stronger in
women (HR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.77, 0.80) than in men (HR = 0.82,
95% CI = 0.81, 0.84). This difference was statistically significant (p-
value for interaction < 0.001) due to the high statistical power of our
study, but relatively small in magnitude (6% per 1-SD increase in IQ).
To assess whether the observed association between childhood IQ
and mortality is graded over the whole range of IQ scores, we first split
the sample into IQ quintiles. Survival curves for each of the quintiles are
presented in Fig. 2, and suggest a graded decrease in risk as IQ category
increases. To assess if this is true for both men and women, we
categorised the MHT scores into deciles, and ran the same proportional
hazard models as before, but with the categorised MHT scores as a
predictor, in men and women separately. As shown in Table 3 and
Fig. 2, there was a graded association between IQ and mortality in both
men and women, and the effect was slightly stronger in women across
the whole range of IQ. In men, the hazard ratio for the lowest decile was
twice that for the highest, with an even stronger result in women.
Note. The MHT score was residualised on age at the time of testing.
We tested whether the association between IQ and mortality varied
depending on age at death. We found that, adjusting for sex, the effect
of IQ was slightly stronger in participants who died when they were 65
and younger (HR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.74, 0.77) than in those partici-
pants who died when they were over 65 years old (HR = 0.79, 95%
CI = 0.78, 0.80). The effect was similar for men and women who died
before and including age 65 (HR = 0.78 and HR = 0.75, respectively),
as well as for men and women who died when they were older than 65
(HR = 0.81 and 0.78, respectively). Although they were small in
magnitude, they were all significantly different (all ps < 0.01). We
based the initial cutoff score of 65 on a previously published study for
comparison (Hart et al., 2005).
In addition, survival curves offer a more detailed picture of differing
survival rates for different IQ quintiles over the continuous follow-up
time (Fig. 3). Namely, participants who scored within the lowest
quintile at the age 11 IQ test had under 70% survival probability at
age 70, versus 80% survival probability of those who scored in the top
IQ quintile. This difference is even more prominent at age 79, where
lowest IQ quintile had about 45% chance of survival, versus 65% for
those in the top IQ quintile (Fig. 2). This analysis is presented for men

 and women taken together, and shows a similar graded effect of the IQ
as presented in Fig. 3 for men and women separately.
We ran an additional sensitivity analysis. We excluded those
participants who scored zero on the MHT (n = 619; 377 deceased)
because this score could represent an irregularity, rather than a true
measure of ability. We ran the baseline model again, with childhood
MHT score and age as predictors, and all-cause mortality as an
outcome. This did not change the result (HR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.79,
0.81).
4. Discussion
The association between higher childhood intelligence and a
reduced risk of all-cause mortality has already been well demonstrated.
However, none of the previous studies has been able to examine this
association in a near-entire population of both men and women, with a
large number of deaths across the whole spectrum of intelligence, and
at different ages of death. Our near-entire population sample allowed us
to: a) examine whether the result would replicate without a selection
bias; b) compare the effect in men and women; c) test whether the
association between intelligence and survival is graded across the
whole range of IQ; and d) test whether the protective effect of
intelligence on mortality differs across different ages of death. Our
results suggest that higher childhood intelligence is linked to a higher
probability of survival at age 79 in an near-entire year-of-birth cohort.
Furthermore, the association between higher IQ and lower mortality
risk was overall slightly stronger in women than in men, and in those
who died before age 65. Finally, an advantage in each of the IQ
quintiles and deciles was associated with an increased hazard ratio for
all-cause mortality, i.e. the association between childhood intelligence
and mortality across almost 70 years of follow-up is mostly graded.
Our finding that higher childhood IQ is associated with a lower risk
of death is in line with those previously reported in a meta-analysis
(Calvin et al., 2011). Whereas the overall meta analytic effect size
(HR = 0.75) was slightly stronger than ours (HR = 0.80), this may be
due to differences in age at intelligence testing and the length of the
follow-up period; some studies tested intelligence in young adulthood,
and follow-up periods vary. Our effect size is very similar to the meta
analytic effect of studies in which IQ was tested between 7 and 12 years
(HR = 0.79). Similarly, when only studies with longer follow-up times
were included in the meta analysis, the effect size was identical to ours
(HR = 0.80) (Calvin et al., 2011).
It is important to understand the reasons for the childhood IQ-
mortality association, but such accounts must be based on a robust
empirical foundation. At a time of ‘replication crisis’ in psychology, we
think that the present report—involving a nearly whole population—-
provides a secure foundation for the childhood IQ-mortality associa-
tion. Therefore, there is a solid basis from which to ask why these
relationships came about.
4.1. Possible mechanisms of the IQ-survival association
A number of models have been proposed to explain (parts of) the
association between higher childhood intelligence and reduced mortal-
ity risk, as we have enumerated and discussed previously (Deary, 2012;
Deary et al., 2010; Whalley & Deary, 2001). For one, higher intelligence
has been consistently linked to a variety of health behaviours
(Gottfredson & Deary, 2004). For example, higher intelligence has been
linked with less cigarette smoking (Batty, Deary, Schoon, & Gale,
2007b; Taylor et al., 2003), less excessive alcohol consumption
(Batty, Deary, & Macintyre, 2007), as well as healthier dietary choices
and higher levels of physical exercise (Batty, Deary, Schoon, & Gale,
2007a). Some of our current findings could be explained by this
mechanism, namely, the differing strength of the association for deaths

 that occur before and after age 65. One previous study suggested that
intelligence may only be associated with early deaths, but not death
later in life (Hart et al., 2005), and our results suggest that, whereas the
inverse IQ-mortality association may be slightly stronger at younger
ages, it is still significant in older age. The slightly stronger association
of IQ with earlier deaths might reflect that earlier deaths are more
preventable, and possibly associated more strongly with health beha-
viours that are also associated with intelligence.
Another often discussed mechanism of the IQ-mortality association
is the effect of SES, through material advantages rather than health
behaviours. With respect to childhood measures, there is good evidence
that parental socioeconomic circumstance does not confound the
relationship between IQ and mortality (Kilgour, Starr, & Whalley,
2010). However, adjusting for adult SES can attenuate the effects of
IQ by up to 30%, suggesting some possible mediation of the IQ-
mortality association by SES (Calvin et al., 2011; Kilgour et al.,
2010); but it should be noted that childhood IQ also influences adult
SES, including education, and social mobility across the life course
(Deary et al., 2005).
There could be other factors that influence the association between
intelligence and mortality. One possibility is that personality traits act
in synergy with intelligence, moderating its association with mortality.
Speculatively, this could be an explanation of the small differences
between the effect sizes in men and in women observed in the present
study. Women on average score higher on conscientiousness (Schmitt,
Realo, Voracek, & Allik, 2008), a personality trait strongly implicated in
better health outcomes, including mortality (Deary et al., 2010; Jokela
et al., 2013; Kern & Friedman, 2008). It is possible that higher IQ
enhances beneficial effects of higher concientiousness, forming a
particularly good basis for better compliance to health advice and
overall increased health behaviours (Bogg & Roberts, 2004; Deary et al.,
2010). Since women on average also score higher on the personality
trait neuroticism (Schmitt et al., 2008), which has been shown to, in
certain cases, have beneficial health effects when interacting with high
conscientiousness (Turiano, Mroczek, Moynihan, & Chapman, 2013), it
is possible that this configuration of personality traits may further
increase the protective effect of intelligence. Furthermore, the interac-
tion between high neuroticism and low intelligence has been shown to
be a stronger predictor of mortality than either of the traits alone
(Weiss, Gale, Batty, & Deary, 2009). Future studies should further
investigate whether different combinations of personality traits interact
with IQ in relation to different health behaviours and mortality.
Another possible explanation of the IQ-mortality association that
has been put forward is the system-integrity hypothesis (Deary, 2010;
Deary, 2012; Whalley & Deary, 2001). This is a notion that higher
scores on a cognitive ability test reflect not only more efficient thought
processes as a reflection of a biologically more efficient brain, but also
body more generally. It is suggested that a ‘better put together body’
exhibits more adaptive reactions to environmental demands, leading to
both higher cognitive ability and survival (Deary, 2012). There is
substantial evidence that low level physiological measures such as
processing speed are a fundamental part of general intelligence
(Sheppard & Vernon, 2008), and one that is not influenced by environ-
mental factors such as education (Ritchie, Bates, Der, Starr, & Deary,
2013). Indeed, processing speed (reaction time) accounts for much of
the intelligence-mortality association (Deary & Der, 2005), although
Deary (2012) suggested that some less cognitive indicator of system
integrity would provide a better test of the hypothesis.
In addition to physiological measures as markers of successful
functioning of various bodily systems, genetic makeup is a testable
candidate that might constitute a foundational aspect of a ‘better put
together body’ (Deary, 2012). Similarly to the system integrity hypoth-
esis, Arden, Gottfredson, and Miller (2009) proposed the existence of a
“fitness factor”, an index of overall genetic quality that is related to
reproductive success and survival. The authors suggested that such a
factor could explain part of the association between intelligence and
mortality. More recent studies have provided evidence in support of this
hypothesis, both from behavioural and molecular genetics angles. For
example, a recent study demonstrated that cognitive functions like
verbal-numerical reasoning, reaction time, and memory have shared
genetic aetiology with adverse health outcomes including BMI, vascu-
lar-metabolic diseases and neuropsychiatric diseases (Hagenaars et al.,
2016). Such shared genetic aetiology between cognitive ability and risk
factors for mortality could explain part of the IQ-mortality associations.
Another recent study utilising three large samples of twins estimated
that the genetic contribution to the link between intelligence and
mortality could be as high as 85–95% (Arden et al., 2015).
These potential explanations are not mutually exclusive, as empha-
sised in Whalley and Deary (2001). One of the biggest challenges
researchers are presented with is to design a study and collect a dataset
that would allow for direct tests of these causal models. One step in the
right direction is a recent study by Belsky et al. (Belsky et al., 2016),
that shows that children with polygenic risk profiles for higher
educational attainment were not healthier than those with lower
polygenic profiles for education, but had higher cognitive and non-
cognitive skills and social mobility. Another GWAS-based study showed
that polygenic profiles for higher educational attainment are indeed
related to mortality (Marioni et al., 2016). Having genetically informa-
tive samples that also contain a breadth of phenotypical data, and a
large follow-up time could be key to answering some of the questions
posited above. Another possibility is that a quasi-experimental educa-
tional reform, such as that described by Brinch and Galloway
(Brinch & Galloway, 2012), could be shown to have effects on mortality
that are mediated by its IQ-improving effect (see also Lager, Seblova,
Falkstedt, & Lövdén, 2016).
4.2. Strengths and limitations
The biggest strength of our study is the fact that it has been
conducted on a near-entire year-of-birth cohort, therefore containing
approximately equal numbers of men and women, a large number of
deaths across the whole range of intelligence and ages of death, and
almost no selection bias.
The present study also has limitations. The group that is lost to
follow-up due to emigration to a foreign country has a higher average
IQ than any of the other groups in the sample, likely due to gaining
higher qualifications and seeking better employment opportunities
elsewhere (Maxwell, 1969). Still, this group comprises a small fraction
of our total sample, and does not affect the overall distribution of IQ
scores in the sample. Another limitation of the current study is that we
were not able to differentiate between causes of death. For example, it
is possible that the stronger protective effect of IQ in younger age is
driven by earlier deaths being caused by unintentional injury, such as
road traffic or industrial accidents (Batty et al., 2009a), or suicide
(Batty et al., 2010). This would shed additional light on potential
mechanism of the associations. Future studies should investigate
associations between intelligence and cause-specific mortality on large
samples with long follow-up times. Finally, we note that our data are
country and year-of-birth specific, and it cannot be assumed that the
results will generalise to other geographical settings and birth-year
cohorts, although there are suggestions of similar IQ-mortality associa-
tions across these variables too (Calvin et al., 2011).
In conclusion, intelligence is a significant predictor of death in both
men and women, especially in younger age. We conclude this from an
unusually-definitive study with near-complete tracing of a near-entire
year-of-birth population, and with a follow-up period of 68 years.
