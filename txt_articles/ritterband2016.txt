IMPORTANCE Although cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has been established
as the first-line recommendation for the millions of adults with chronic insomnia, there is a
paucity of trained clinicians to deliver this much needed treatment. Internet-delivered CBT-I
has shown promise as a method to overcome this obstacle; however, the long-term
effectiveness has not been proven in a representative sample with chronic insomnia.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate a web-based, automated CBT-I intervention to improve insomnia in
the short term (9 weeks) and long term (1 year).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A randomized clinical trial comparing the internet CBT-I
with internet patient education at baseline, 9 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year. Altogether,
303 adults with chronic insomnia self-referred to participate, of whom 151 (49.8%) reported
at least 1 medical or psychiatric comorbidity.
INTERVENTIONS The internet CBT-I (Sleep Healthy Using the Internet [SHUTi]) was a 6-week
fully automated, interactive, and tailored web-based program that incorporated the primary
tenets of face-to-face CBT-I. The online patient education program provided nontailored and
fixed online information about insomnia.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary sleep outcomes were self-reported online
ratings of insomnia severity (Insomnia Severity Index) and online sleep diary–derived values
for sleep-onset latency and wake after sleep onset, collected prospectively for 10 days at
each assessment period. The secondary sleep outcomes included sleep efficiency, number
of awakenings, sleep quality, and total sleep time.
RESULTS Among 303 participants, the mean (SD) age was 43.28 (11.59) years, and 71.9%
(218 of 303) were female. Of these, 151 were randomized to the SHUTi group and 152 to the
online patient education group. Results of the 3 primary sleep outcomes showed that the
overall group × time interaction was significant for all variables, favoring the SHUTi group
(Insomnia Severity Index [F3,1063 = 20.65, P < .001], sleep-onset latency [F3,1042 = 6.01,
P < .001], and wake after sleep onset [F3,1042 = 12.68, P < .001]). Within-group effect sizes
demonstrated improvements from baseline to postassessment for the SHUTi participants
(range, Cohen d = 0.79 [95% CI, 0.55-1.04] to d = 1.90 [95% CI, 1.62-2.18]). Treatment effects
were maintained at the 1-year follow-up (SHUTi Insomnia Severity Index d = 2.32 [95% CI,
2.01-2.63], sleep-onset latency d = 1.41 [95% CI, 1.15-1.68], and wake after sleep onset
d = 0.95 [95% CI, 0.70-1.21]), with 56.6% (69 of 122) achieving remission status and 69.7%
(85 of 122) deemed treatment responders at 1 year based on Insomnia Severity Index data.
All secondary sleep outcomes, except total sleep time, also showed significant overall
group × time interactions, favoring the SHUTi group.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Given its efficacy and availability, internet-delivered CBT-I
may have a key role in the dissemination of effective behavioral treatments for insomnia.

I
nsomnia is a significant public health problem with sub-
stantial medical, psychiatric, and financial ramifications.
Simplydefined,insomniaisdifficultyfallingasleepormain-
taining sleep, and it is one of the most common health con-
cerns today.1 Approximately 35% to 50% of the general adult
population experience insomnia symptoms,2 with 12% to 20%
meetingcriteriaforinsomniaasadisorder.3,4Insomniaishighly
comorbid with medical5 and psychiatric6 disorders. The com-
bined direct and indirect costs associated with insomnia ex-
ceed $100 billion in the United States alone.7 Given the high
prevalence and detrimental effect of insomnia, finding effec-
tive, accessible, and affordable treatment is critical.
Cognitivebehaviortherapy(CBT)andpharmacotherapyare
theonly2treatmentswithsufficientempiricalsupporttoberec-
ommended for treating chronic insomnia (>1 month).8,9 While
medication use is readily accessible and effective in the short
term,CBTforinsomnia(CBT-I)haslonger-lastingbenefits,with
fewer adverse effects.10 It is now recommended as a first-line
treatment.1,9 Most important, CBT-I addresses the problematic
thoughtsandbehaviorsbelievedtohavedevelopedinresponse
toacuteinsomniaorashort-termsleepproblem(daysorweeks).
Although there is strong empirical support for CBT-I, the
lack of trained clinicians and expense, while cost-effective,11
limits access. To overcome these barriers, innovative meth-
ods of delivering CBT-I have been developed, and initial evi-
dencesupportstheirfeasibilityandefficacy.12Todate,internet-
based trials with published outcomes have been small,
homogeneous, and limited in their generalizability and have
excluded individuals with insomnia co-occurring with medi-
cal and psychiatric disorders.13
The present study was designed to address several
limitations that exist within the internet-delivered CBT-I
literature.12Thislarge-scalerandomizedclinicaltrialtestedthe
long-term effect of a fully automated internet CBT-I interven-
tion in a heterogeneous sample representing geographic, psy-
chiatric, and medical diversity. In contrast to those with ac-
cess to an insomnia education website, the internet CBT-I
participants were hypothesized to show greater improve-
ments in the primary sleep outcomes of Insomnia Severity In-
dex (ISI), sleep-onset latency (SOL), and wake after sleep on-
set (WASO). It was also hypothesized that the internet CBT-I
participants would demonstrate greater improvements in the
secondary sleep outcomes, including sleep efficiency, num-
ber of awakenings, sleep quality, and total sleep time. Inter-
vention use and clinical significance are also described.
Methods
Design
This single-blind (participant) randomized clinical trial in-
cluded 303 adults aged 21 to 65 years with chronic insomnia.
Outcome data were collected online in this 2-group (internet-
delivered CBT-I vs online patient education [PE]) trial at 4 as-
sessment points, including baseline, 9 weeks, 6 months, and
1 year. All participants gave informed consent by providing a
digital signature to the online form after discussion with study
staff (including one of us, C.F.) by telephone. The study de-
sign and protocol (Supplement 1) were approved by the Insti-
tutional Review Board for Health Sciences Research at the
University of Virginia, Charlottesville.
Participants
Adults with regular internet access were eligible to partici-
pate if they met the following criteria: (1) they required more
than 30 minutes to fall asleep at the beginning of the night
(sleep-onset insomnia) or more than 30 minutes of time awake
after initially falling asleep (sleep maintenance insomnia) for
at least 3 nights per week for at least 6 months, (2) their total
sleep time averaged 6.5 hours or less, and (3) they manifested
sleep disturbances (or associated daytime symptoms) caus-
ing significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,
or other areas of functioning. Exclusion criteria included the
following: (1) the presence of another untreated sleep disor-
der, (2) an irregular schedule that would prevent adoption of
intervention strategies (ie, work schedule resulting in usual
bedtime earlier than 8 PM or later than 2 AM or arising time ear-
lier than 4 AM or later than 10 AM), (3) pregnancy, (4) current
or past behavioral treatment for insomnia, and (5) initiation
of any psychological treatment within the previous 3 months.
Comorbid psychiatric disorders were included unless the in-
dividual met criteria for any of the following: moderate to high
current risk of suicide, severe major depression, bipolar dis-
order, or alcohol or drug abuse within the past year. Comor-
bidmedicalconditionswereincludedunlesstheyweredeemed
active, unstable, and degenerative (eg, congestive heart fail-
ure or multiple sclerosis) in a manner that could worsen the
insomnia. Participants could be taking medications, includ-
ing sleep medications, if the medication regimen had not been
changed in the previous 3 months.
Outcome Measures
Measures used in this study included the ISI,14 a 7-item global
index of self-reported insomnia symptom severity that has
been shown to be valid, reliable, and sensitive to changes in
insomnia treatment14,15 and validated for online use.16 Daily
Key Points
Question What is the efficacy of a fully automated
internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia
intervention compared with an insomnia patient education
website with respect to the primary sleep outcomes of Insomnia
Severity Index, sleep onset latency, and wake after sleep onset in
a heterogeneous sample?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 303 adults with
chronic insomnia, those who received the internet cognitive
behavior therapy for insomnia intervention (Sleep Healthy Using
the Internet [SHUTi]) had significantly improved sleep compared
with those who received access to the patient education website,
with 56.6% achieving insomnia remission status and 69.7%
deemed treatment responders at 1 year.
Meaning Achieving improved sleep outcomes using an internet
intervention without human support that are similar in magnitude
to those reported in trials with face-to-face cognitive behavior
therapy for insomnia has important implications for public health.

sleepdiaries17basedonconsensussleepdiaryquestions17were
collected online prospectively during a 2-week period at each
of the 4 assessment periods. A semistructured clinical tele-
phone interview was conducted to obtain a detailed sleep and
health history, screen for other sleep disorders, and assess for
psychiatric comorbidity using the Mini-International Neuro-
psychiatric Interview18 and included components of the Di-
agnosticInterviewforInsomnia.19Finally,interventionuseand
adherence were measured using login frequency, diary count,
and number of cores completed. More details are available in
the eAppendix in Supplement 2.
Interventions
Internet CBT-I (Sleep Healthy Using the Internet)
Sleep Healthy Using the Internet (SHUTi) is a fully auto-
mated, interactive, and tailored web-based program that in-
corporates the primary tenets of face-to-face CBT-I, includ-
ing sleep restriction, stimulus control, cognitive restructuring,
sleephygiene,andrelapseprevention.20-22Othercontentareas
that are occasionally included in CBT-I, such as relaxation and
medication titration, were not included (details are available
in the eAppendix in Supplement 2).
Online PE
The online PE program provided nontailored and fixed mate-
rial about insomnia symptoms and the effect, prevalence, and
causes of insomnia. It also discussed when to see a physician
and basic lifestyle, environmental, and behavioral strategies
to improve sleep (details are available in the eAppendix in
Supplement 2).
Procedure
Participantswererecruitedonline(Figure1andFigure2).Those
enrolled completed a baseline assessment that included ques-
tionnaires and 10 days of sleep diaries. They then received ac-
cess to their assigned web program for 9 weeks, followed by
postassessment data collection after the intervention period
and again at 6 months and 1 year that included question-
naires and sleep diaries. Participants received online gift cer-
tificates for completing the postassessment and 6-month fol-
low-up ($50 each) and the 1-year follow-up ($100).
Statistical Analysis
Sample size was calculated based on an effect size between
groups of Cohen d = 0.20 on each of the 3 primary sleep out-
comes (ISI, SOL, and WASO) and an anticipated 35.0% attrition
rate across the 1-year study. Powering the study at 80% to de-
tect pre-post differences between groups with α = .05 (using
G*Power 3 software23), a sample size of 300 individuals was
planned to achieve 220 participants after expected attrition.
Differences by treatment group in baseline characteristics,
ratesofpostassessmentandfollow-upnonadherence,andpost-
treatmentISIresponseandremittancewereanalyzedwithttests
for continuous variables, Wilcoxon rank sum tests for skewed
continuous variables, and χ2 tests for categorical variables. Sta-

Results
Between October 19, 2011, and July 2, 2013, a total of 1212 in-
dividualssubmittedonlineformsthatindicatedinterestinpar-
ticipating in this trial. Of them, 303 were enrolled, living in 41
different states in the United States and the District of Colum-
bia, and were instructed to complete the online baseline as-
sessment that included questionnaires and prospective sleep
diaries. After baseline data collection, 151 were randomized to
receive SHUTi, and 152 were randomized to receive access to
online PE.

During baseline diary collection, of 151 participants, 51.0%
(n = 77) of the SHUTi group and 45.7% (n = 69) of the PE group
reported taking a sleep aid (prescription or nonprescription)
at least 1 night during the baseline period. Among those who
reported using a sleep aid, an average of 56% of baseline nights
were classified as medicated nights. Numbers of participants
reporting at least 1 medicated night decreased during the pos-
tassessment, 6-month follow-up, and 1-year follow-up peri-
ods,withvaluesof38.3%(49of128),37.2%(42of113)and33.1%
(40 of 121) for the SHUTi group and 42.5% (57 of 134), 34.4%
(43 of 125), and 33.9% (43 of 127) for the PE group, respec-
tively. A logistic mixed-model analysis examining sleep medi-
cation use over time by group shows that, while the groups did
not differ over time (χ2 = 3.00, P = .39), there was an effect for
time (χ2 = 18.32, P < .001), indicating that both groups re-
duced sleep aid use over time. Participants also reported a high
rate of comfort in using the internet, and most indicated that
they check email and use the internet daily.
Primary Sleep Outcomes
Results of the 3 primary sleep outcomes are shown in Figure 3.
The overall group × time interactions were significant for the
ISI (F3,1063 = 20.65, P < .001), SOL (F3,1042 = 6.01, P < .001), and
WASO (F3,1042 = 12.68, P < .001). Within-group time effects,
from baseline to postassessment, were large for the SHUTi
group (range, 0.79-1.90) and small to large for the PE group
(range, 0.37-0.77). At the 1-year follow-up, the SHUTi group ex-
perienced significant improvements from baseline on the ISI
(Cohen d = 2.32; 95% CI, 2.01-2.63), SOL (Cohen d = 0.95; 95%
CI, 0.70-1.21), and WASO (Cohen d = 1.41; 95% CI, 1.15-1.68).
The PE group also experienced improvements (although

follow-up. A similar pattern was observed using criteria of in-
somnia remittance (<8 on the ISI15): 40.6% (54 of 133) (base-
line to postassessment), 49.1% (56 of 114) (baseline to 6-month
follow-up), and 56.6% (69 of 122) (baseline to 1-year follow-
up) of the SHUTi group were deemed insomnia remitters com-
pared with 11.3% (16 of 142) (baseline to postassessment),
24.0% (31 of 129) (baseline to 6-month follow-up), and 27.3%
(35 of 128) (baseline to 1-year follow-up) of the PE group.
Primary Sleep Outcomes by Comorbidity
Additional mixed-model interactions were used to examine
whether the presence of a comorbid condition influenced the
treatment effect on the primary sleep outcomes. The 3 comor-
bidity groupings were categorized as (1) the presence or ab-
sence of medical comorbidity, (2) the presence or absence of
psychiatric comorbidity, and (3) the presence or absence of any
comorbidity.Inallcases,thosewithacomorbiditydidnotshow
significantly different changes over time by group in sleep out-
comes than those without a comorbidity.
Secondary Sleep Outcomes
Significant group × time interaction effects were found on the
secondary sleep outcomes of sleep efficiency (F3,1042 = 8.39,
P < .001), number of awakenings (F3,1042 = 3.41, P = .02), and
sleep quality (F3,1042 = 2.93, P = .03) but not total sleep time
(F3,1042 = 0.40, P = .76). Effect sizes showed patterns similar to
those of the primary sleep outcomes (Table 2). Specifically, the
SHUTigroupexperiencedlargereffectsfrombaselinetothepost-
assessment,6-monthfollow-up,and1-yearfollow-upcompared
with the PE group for all secondary sleep variables except total

9-weekinterventionperiod,withamedianlogincountof25.The
SHUTigroupsubmittedamedianof44sleepdiariesduringthis

(91 of 151) of the SHUTi group completed all 6 cores of the pro-

6.6% (10 of 151) completed through the fifth core.
For those in the SHUTi group who completed all 6 cores,
the estimated marginal mean (EMM) (SD) ISI at postassess-
ment was 7.99 (0.47) compared with 12.24 (0.69) (P < .001 for
group difference) for those who completed less than 6 cores.
However, during the 1-year follow-up period, the difference in
EMM (SD) ISIs for those who completed all 6 cores and those
who did not diminished. At the 6-month follow-up and 1-year
follow-up, those who completed all 6 cores had EMM (SD) ISIs
of 7.90 (0.53) and 6.91 (0.57), respectively, while those who did
not complete all 6 cores had EMM (SD) ISIs of 9.98 (0.97) and
8.56 (0.93), respectively.

Discussion
This randomized clinical trial is the first to evaluate the long-
term efficacy of a fully automated internet-delivered CBT-I in-
tervention to improve sleep in a heterogeneous sample of
adults with chronic insomnia. The SHUTi group experienced
significant improvements in ISI, SOL, and WASO—the 3 pri-
mary sleep outcomes. With all participants averaging in the
moderate severity insomnia range of 15 to 21 on the ISI at base-
line, those in the SHUTi group had a mean ISI of less than 8
(denoting no insomnia) at the 1-year follow-up, whereas the
PE group was in the subthreshold insomnia range of 8 to 14.
The study design was of particular importance in evalu-
ating the efficacy of online CBT-I. The PE condition formed an
active control, offering high-quality information similar to that
found in a PE booklet or in patient-oriented online materials,
and some improvements were expected. The finding of greater
improvement in all measures among the SHUTi groups dem-
onstrates the value of the metered, interactive, and tailored
formatanalogoustowhattypicallyoccursinface-to-faceCBT-I.
Previous studies have documented the efficacy of online
CBT-I to improve insomnia, but these early investigations used
small samples, homogeneous populations, and limited com-
parisonconditionsandreliedoncostlyhumansupporttoguide
users through the program or failed to include long-term
follow-up.12Thepresentstudyaddressestheseissuesanddem-
onstrates that positive outcomes can be achieved and main-
tained when using a robust internet intervention for insom-
nia in a general population of adults with insomnia.
Participants in this trial represented a symptomatic group
with a long history of insomnia. Consistent with previous trials
of SHUTi25,26 but in contrast to the general internet interven-
tion literature,27 dropout attrition (participants not complet-
ing follow-up measures) was low, with 9.2% (28 of 303) lost at
thepostassessmentand17.5%(53of303)lostatthe1-yearfollow-
up.Nonuseattrition(participantswhodonotcompleteallcores
of the intervention) was low at 39.7% (60 of 151). This finding
is notable given that no clinical support was provided as part
of the intervention. Although there is limited research exam-
ining why completion rates differ across programs, many re-
searchersspeculatethatincreasedinteractivityandtailoringmay
foster engagement and ultimately program adherence.13,28
Limitations
Although this study addresses many shortcomings of previ-
ous internet-delivered CBT-I studies, our findings must still be
considered in light of several limitations. The sample is pri-
marily of white race and non-Hispanic ethnicity, well edu-
cated, and comfortable using the internet. With that said, this
sample is more heterogeneous than other internet-delivered
CBT-I studies because it included a national (US) sample of par-
ticipants in which 16.2% (49 of 303) were of nonwhite race;
7.9% (24 of 303) were of Hispanic ethnicity, and 49.8% (151 of
303) had a comorbid condition. However, the full range of
medical and psychiatric conditions that co-occur with insom-
nia is not represented in this study. Another limitation is that
the SHUTi group had sleep difficulties for a significantly lon-
ger time (10 years) compared with the PE group (7 years). That
said, this difference would likely result in more conservative
findings if it had any effect on outcomes. In addition, mini-
mal masking occurred because savvy participants could de-
duce the web program to which they were randomized based
on their online experience. Finally, no objective measure of
sleep was used; however, while some researchers may ques-
tion the validity of self-reported sleep data, daily sleep dia-
ries are used in more than 90% of treatment studies of
insomnia,29andtrackingsleepvariablesduringmultipleweeks
provides a more comprehensive understanding of sleep prob-
lems than polysomnography, which is usually only adminis-
teredfor1to3nights.29Sleepdiariesarereliableandvalidmea-
sures of sleep and correlate strongly with findings using other
objective measures of sleep, such as polysomnography,30-34
actigraphy,35-39 and spousal reports.33,39
Conclusions
Internet-delivered CBT-I provides a less expensive, scalable
treatment option that could reach previously unimaginable
numbers of people. Future studies are necessary to deter-
mine who may be best served by this type of intervention and
how the next steps of dissemination should occur. Ensuring
that these interventions work with different patient popula-
tions, whether tailored or not for those groups, should also be
examined. In addition, exploring the use of these interven-
tions with lower educated, less technologically experienced,
and older populations will be critical to broad dissemination
efforts.
This study provides compelling evidence that the self-
guided,web-basedCBT-IinterventionSHUTicaneffectivelytreat
insomnia. It extends findings that internet-delivered CBT-I can
meaningfullyimproveinsomniasymptomsandsleepvariables,
including when insomnia is comorbid with other conditions.
