Abstract
Background: The significant global variations in surgical oncology training paradigms can have a detrimental effect on tackling the rising
global cancer burden. While some variations in training are essential to account for the differences in types of cancer and biology, the funda-
mental principles of providing care to a cancer patient remain the same. The development of a global curriculum in surgical oncology with
incorporated essential standards could be very useful in building an adequately trained surgical oncology workforce, which in turn could
help in tackling the rising global cancer burden.
Materials and methods: The leaders of the Society of Surgical Oncology and European Society of Surgical Oncology convened a global
curriculum committee to develop a global curriculum in surgical oncology.
Results: A global curriculum in surgical oncology was developed to incorporate the required domains considered to be essential in training a
surgical oncologist. The curriculum was constructed in a modular fashion to permit flexibility to suit the needs of the different regions of the
world. Similarly, recognizing the various sociocultural, financial and cultural influences across the world, the proposed curriculum is aspi-
rational and not mandatory in intent.
Conclusions: A global curriculum was developed which may be considered as a foundational scaffolding for training surgical oncologists
worldwide. It is envisioned that this initial global curriculum will provide a flexible and modular scaffolding that can be tailored by indi-
vidual countries or regions to train surgical oncologists in a way that is appropriate for practice in their local environment.

The global cancer burden is expected to increase signif-
icantly over the next few decades. Worldwide in 2012 there

 were 14.1 million new cancer cases, 8.2 million cancer-
related deaths, and 32.6 million people living with cancer
within 5 years of diagnosis.1 It is predicted that by the
year 2035 there will be 23.9 million new cancer cases
and 14.6 million cancer-related deaths (Figure 1).1
The distribution of the global cancer burden is and will
continue to be very uneven, with the majority of cases af-
flicting the less-developed regions of the world. In 2012,
5.3 million (65%) new cancer cases and 15.6 million
(48%)
cancer-related
deaths
occurred
in
the
less-
developed regions of the world.1 Similarly, by 2035, 14.7
million (61%) new cancer cases and 10.3 million (70%)
cancer-related deaths will occur in the less-developed re-
gions of the world.1
Nearly 80% of cancer patients will need surgical inter-
vention at some point, and by the year 2030 it is estimated
that 45 million surgical procedures will be required annu-
ally.2 It is well known that the majority of patients with a
cancer diagnosis do not have ready access to safe and/or
affordable
cancer
surgery.2,3
The
failure
to
provide
adequate cancer surgery can lead to a loss of USD 6.2 tril-
lion in cumulative worldwide gross domestic product by
2030.2 While the causes are multifactorial, one factor
impeding access to safe and affordable cancer surgery is
the paucity of surgeons who are trained and educated in
the management of patients with various cancer diagnoses.
The ability to develop a sustainably adequate surgical
oncology workforce depends on the presence of robust
educational systems that promote training in all oncologic
domains, and also on help in maintaining competency for
those in clinical practice. Undoubtedly, there are significant
differences in cancer burden, cancer types, resource avail-
ability, oncologic management, and even in the definition
of the oncologic workforce in different parts of the world.
However, the fight against cancer is global, and any effort
aimed at finding uniformity in the global management of
cancer would be of tremendous benefit to the worldwide
community. We believe that this should start with the gen-
eration of broad uniform guidelines on the training and
maintenance
of
competency
for
surgical
oncology
professionals.
There are several barriers to cancer care, including lack
of cancer awareness and cultural barriers to presentation,
lack of affordable basic population healthcare provisions,
dearth of adequate facilities, and inadequate numbers of
trained personnel. Whilst it is inevitable that in certain
countries inadequate training may be just one of many com-
plex factors acting as barriers to adequate cancer care, hav-
ing a globally accepted gold standard for minimal training
in surgical oncology will help to disseminate best practice,
raise
global
average
standards
of
care,
and
reduce
inequalities.
The aim of this position statement is to build on and
harmonize
our
previous
respective
society
training
curricula and requirements4e6 and thereby to provide a
foundational scaffolding for essential and common require-
ments for training surgical oncology professionals. The au-
thors are aware that the training of surgical oncologists
worldwide is extremely variable,7 and they provide a broad
schema of the training pathway (Figure 2). The position
statement is not intended to mandate specific content for
training for each region or country of the world. It is hoped
that this scaffolding of essential requirements will be used
as an aspirational framework upon which to make modifi-
cations to suit the needs of the specific region or country
in the future. It is deliberately designed to be modular
and flexible to permit adaptation to the disease burden var-
iations and the cultural and health economic realities of
diverse countries. The authors are deeply aware of the
diverse barriers to education in different parts of the world
based on the sociocultural, geopolitical and financial con-
straints. Hence the paper does not purport to be all-
encompassing but instead focuses on the salient aspects
of training that are essential to incorporate into the training
curriculum of a surgical oncologist. A summary of the cur-
riculum is depicted in Table 1.
Core domains of general oncology for the surgical
oncologist
A surgical oncologist is an oncologist who also pos-
sesses the expertise to perform operative procedures and in-
terventions. As such, every surgical oncologist should
possess the required knowledge of the basic principles
and tenets of oncology. These are outlined below.

Core domains in pre-, peri- and post-operative surgical
care for the surgical oncologist
The surgical oncologist should be technically proficient
in the art, science and principles of surgical procedures.
This should enable the surgical oncologist to perform surgi-
cal procedures when indicated in a safe fashion to deliver
high-value care with good-quality outcomes. The surgical
oncologist should therefore possess the required knowledge
and skill of the basic principles and tenets of simple and
complex oncological procedures. It should be emphasized
that surgical care for oncology patients is provided by a
wide variety of professionals with equally divergent
training backgrounds. While in some countries surgical
oncology training follows general surgery training, in
some others surgical cancer care is delivered by general
surgeons with no further training. Although some of the
mentioned domains may be adequately addressed through
general surgery training in some countries, or may be
redundant for surgical oncology training in countries with
fellowships, the purpose of including these reflects what
the finished product should be competent in, regardless of
the training pathway. These are outlined below.
1. Principles of surgical procedures and techniques,
which include:
a. Knowledge of the basic and complex surgical proce-
dures for treating malignancies of various organ
systems.
b. Knowledge of the principles of clinically relevant
anatomy applicable to surgical procedures.
c. Knowledge of the extent of resection for primary le-
sions and metastatic lesions.
d. Knowledge of the appropriate extent of lymphadenec-
tomy, ranging from nodal sampling, sentinel-node bi-

f. Knowledge of the role of debulking surgery.
g. Awareness of the differences in management between

h. An understanding of the balance between oncologic
adequacy versus minimizing morbidity and preser-
ving function in oncologic procedures.
2. Principles of various surgical approaches for cancer
surgery
It has to be emphasized that competence in this domain
will be entirely dependent on the availability of re-
sources, which eventually determines the availability

Essential training in core competencies that need to be
satisfied
1. Holistic patient care
A surgical oncologist should be able to provide patient
care that is evidence-based, wholly compassionate, and
comprehensive to address all the multiple afflictions arising
10
C. Are et al. / EJSO xx (2016) 1e13

j.ejso.2016.04.005
 from the diagnosis of cancer. The primary purpose of can-
cer care is to enhance the holistic wellbeing of the patient.
Whilst the inevitable focus is on cure of the cancer, this
must be dispensed in a way that preserves or enhances qual-
ity-of-life and the patient’s physical and mental wellbeing.
The basic tenet of cancer care should rely on ‘adding life to
years and not years to life’.
Surgical oncologists have a professional duty to main-
tain and continually update their expertise to enable them
to offer patient care that maximizes beneficial outcomes
within the limits of the healthcare environment in which
they practice. Cancer patients are extremely vulnerable dur-
ing their treatment phase, and a surgical oncologist should
be able to work with multidisciplinary teams to address the
personal needs and preferences of patients when making
treatment choices.
2. Medical knowledge
A surgical oncologist should possess the required medi-
cal knowledge that encompasses the entire spectrum,
including etiology, risk factors, diagnosis, treatment and
surveillance. Medical knowledge is in a phase of rapid
and sustained evolution, with nearly 2 million scientific pa-
pers published annually. It is the obligation of the surgical
oncologist to stay abreast of the current, new and novel
knowledge domains. The surgical oncologist should strive
to acquire knowledge of other specialties that comprise a
multidisciplinary team.
3. Professionalism
Professionalism is a holistic construct resting on the pro-
vision of delivering good care, demonstrating honesty, main-
taining ethical standards, displaying respect and sensitivity
to diverse cultures, and serving as a good role model. The
reputation of oneself and the profession must be maintained
by working with the highest levels of probity and quality of
care. The confidentiality of the patient must be respected at
all times with reference to the national legal frameworks
for data protection. The surgical oncologist must take re-
sponsibility for their actions and outcomes with honesty
and a desire to continually improve, always putting the pa-
tient’s needs first. Professionalism is not just the province
of the individual surgeon but of the healthcare provider orga-
nization which has a duty to provide a professional working
environment that supports these goals.21
4. Inter-professional team working and communication
skills
The surgical oncologist should demonstrate the ability to
work with multidisciplinary teams that stretch across disci-
plines and professions in a respectful manner that fosters
positive team dynamics. The leading role of the surgical
oncologist
is
based
on
a
profound
and
respectful
understanding of all professionals involved. The decision-
making process will benefit from scientific knowledge,
clinical experience and compassionate insight provided by
the whole team.
The surgical oncologist should also possess communica-
tion skills that are based on empathy, openness and honesty.
Excellent communication skills are required to communi-
cate not only with other professionals but also with patients
and their family members. Communication with other pro-
fessionals is based on equity, respect, and sharing of med-
ical knowledge. Communication with families and relatives
is based on honesty and the translation of complex medical
knowledge into lay terminology to help with shared
decision-making. It is essential to acknowledge that
communication is a two-way process, and the views and
opinions of patients are respectfully incorporated in all
key management decisions.
5. Experiential learning
The surgical oncologist should be able to learn from
their own experiences and implement measures to improve
outcomes. This starts with a critical assessment of their own
outcomes relative to nationally established benchmarks,
and implementation of individual or system-wide measures
to address areas of deficiency.
Since surgery is a craft discipline, learning from critical
self-assessment cannot be accomplished solely in a didactic
learning environment but requires hands-on training. This
may be provided within the clinical environment with su-
pervised training, but also by use of simulation training
which is especially valuable for the acquisition of early-
phase skills.22 Unlike knowledge retention, which is readily
tested by written examination, higher-level skills on
Miller’s pyramid for the assessment of clinical compe-
tencies (knowledge, competence, performance, action23)
require more complex methods of assessment such as
OSCE-type assessments and a range of workplace-based
assessments.24e26 Training should not be based entirely
around a time-frame or minimum-numbers-based system
but on a competency-based system.
In addition to a structured quality-assured training pro-
gram, outcomes must also be quality-assured throughout
a surgeon’s career. Cancer units must have robust protocols
which are updated regularly in line with national and inter-
national guidelines, and these must be audited against both
at unit level and at surgeon level. This must not be done as
part of a blame culture but as part of the process of
constructive feedback to facilitate constant improvement.
The role of audit or outcomes research in improving cancer
care is widely proven to be effective in improving
outcomes.27
6. Systems-based practice (focus on cost/value of health-
care delivery and quality and safety of healthcare
delivery)
11
C. Are et al. / EJSO xx (2016) 1e13
Please cite this article in press as: Are C, et al., Global curriculum in surgical oncology, Eur J Surg Oncol (2016), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/
j.ejso.2016.04.005
 As the complexity of healthcare delivery has increased,
a surgical oncologist must understand the different settings
of healthcare, ranging from individual practices, group
practices, stand-alone clinics, community healthcare cen-
ters, to academic centers and how they relate to the larger
context of healthcare delivery for their respective region
or nation.
The surgical oncologist should possess knowledge of the
geopolitical situation, social stability and health policies,
and regulations that can influence healthcare. In addition,
an understanding of the gross domestic product spent on
healthcare and the costs of delivering patient care at an indi-
vidual level is essential. All surgical oncologists must
demonstrate an awareness of and responsiveness to the larger
context and system of healthcare, as well as the ability to call
effectively on other resources in the system to provide
optimal healthcare. Some of the key steps are to coordinate
patient care within the healthcare system, to incorporate con-
siderations of cost awareness and riskebenefit analysis in pa-
tient care, to advocate for quality patient care and optimal
patient care systems, to work in inter-professional teams to
enhance patient safety and improve the quality of patient
care, and to participate in identifying system errors and im-
plementing potential systems solutions.
7. Operative skills for surgical professionals
The surgical oncologist should possess technical skills to
be able to perform operative procedures safely whilst
adhering to the established oncologic principles, and to
deliver acceptable perioperative, short-term and long-term
oncologic outcomes.
Embracing the ‘art of surgery’ is a life-long process
which rests on dedication, dexterity, intuition, and good
tuition. With a rapidly growing number of new techniques
and a mounting variety of innovative instrumentations, a
dedicated surgical oncologist should constantly aim to up-
date their operative skills and repertoire. This continuous
process benefits from extensive reading of the rapidly
evolving relevant literature, attending scientific meetings
(either physical or virtual) and participation in skills-
based workshops.
Hands-on learning is crucial to surgical practice; sur-
geons are therefore encouraged to visit expert colleagues
who should be willing to share their advanced knowledge.
Numerous fellowships are available to serve this purpose:
the SSO and ESSO have established training programs
and bursaries to facilitate and promote practical education.
8. Understanding of the human/compassionate side of
medicine applicable to all socioeconomic and diverse
cultural regions of the world
Medical and surgical practices often employ evidence-
based standards and hard science in the search for advanced
cancer treatments. In reality, the practice of SURGICAL
ONCOLOGY is both an art and a science; at the moment
it represents the most effective practice for healing cancer
patients. Patients are at the very center of the art of compas-
sionate care, when social interaction is combined with med-
ical science.
Geographical, cultural, economic, religious and ethical
issues may differ substantially, and patients’ expectations
vary accordingly. Treatment availability is distributed un-
evenly, and so is cancer awareness and access to diag-
nostic/screening tests. Such differences should be taken
into account when setting up the foundation of a surgical
oncology program. The mission of a surgical oncologist
is focused on patient wellbeing within the context of his
or her psychosocial environment.
Conclusions and future
In summary, the aim of this position statement is to pro-
vide a foundational scaffolding of requirements for training
surgical oncologists globally. This curriculum is neither all-
inclusive nor all-encompassing, and may not be equally
applicable to all countries or regions of the world. It is likely
that some modules of the curriculum could be redundant for
some regions, whereas some modules could be out of the
reach of or not applicable to others. The authors and their
respective societies are acutely aware that the educational
environment, training structure and pathways, and regula-
tions are extremely variable across the world. Similarly
various social, cultural and economic factors can have a
strong influence on the educational environment for surgical
oncologists. Despite these enormous differences, the founda-
tional requirements for training surgical oncologists globally
to provide optimal cancer care are uniform. It is therefore en-
visioned that this initial position statement will provide a
flexible and modular scaffolding that can be tailored by indi-
vidual countries or regions to train surgical oncologists in a
way that is suitable for practice in their local environment.
