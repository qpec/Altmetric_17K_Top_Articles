IMPORTANCE Cohort studies have reported increased incidence of cardiovascular disease
(CVD) among individuals with low vitamin D status. To date, randomized clinical trials of
vitamin D supplementation have not found an effect, possibly because of using too low a
dose of vitamin D.
OBJECTIVE To examine whether monthly high-dose vitamin D supplementation prevents
CVD in the general population.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Vitamin D Assessment Study is a randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that recruited participants mostly from family practices
in Auckland, New Zealand, from April 5, 2011, through November 6, 2012, with follow-up until
July 2015. Participants were community-resident adults aged 50 to 84 years. Of 47 905
adults invited from family practices and 163 from community groups, 5110 participants were
randomized to receive vitamin D3 (n = 2558) or placebo (n = 2552). Two participants
retracted consent, and all others (n = 5108) were included in the primary analysis.
INTERVENTIONS Oral vitamin D3 in an initial dose of 200 000 IU, followed a month later by
monthly doses of 100 000 IU, or placebo for a median of 3.3 years (range, 2.5-4.2 years).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the number of participants with
incident CVD and death, including a prespecified subgroup analysis in participants with
vitamin D deficiency (baseline deseasonalized 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels
<20 ng/mL). Secondary outcomes were myocardial infarction, angina, heart failure,
hypertension, arrhythmias, arteriosclerosis, stroke, and venous thrombosis.
RESULTS Of the 5108 participants included in the analysis, the mean (SD) age was 65.9 (8.3)
years, 2969 (58.1%) were male, and 4253 (83.3%) were of European or other ethnicity, with
the remainder being Polynesian or South Asian. Mean (SD) baseline deseasonalized 25(OH)D
concentration was 26.5 (9.0) ng/mL, with 1270 participants (24.9%) being vitamin D
deficient. In a random sample of 438 participants, the mean follow-up 25(OH)D level was
greater than 20 ng/mL higher in the vitamin D group than in the placebo group. The primary
outcome of CVD occurred in 303 participants (11.8%) in the vitamin D group and 293
participants (11.5%) in the placebo group, yielding an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.02 (95% CI,
0.87-1.20). Similar results were seen for participants with baseline vitamin D deficiency and
for secondary outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Monthly high-dose vitamin D supplementation does not
prevent CVD. This result does not support the use of monthly vitamin D supplementation for
this purpose. The effects of daily or weekly dosing require further study.

 T
he possibility that UV radiation, through a mecha-
nism that involves vitamin D, may protect against
cardiovascular disease (CVD) was initially proposed
in 1981.1 Results from recent meta-analyses2,3 have con-
firmed that people with low vitamin D status have increased
risk of CVD. Several pathophysiologic mechanisms could
explain this inverse association.4
Confirmation of the vitamin D–CVD hypothesis requires
evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of vitamin D
supplementation, which is limited for the general popula-
tion. The Women’
s Health Initiative found no benefit from a
vitamin D supplement (combined with calcium) against
CVD,5 although the intiative has been criticized because of
its very low vitamin D3 dose (400 IU/d) and poor adher-
ence.6,7 Another population-based RCT reported a nonsig-
nificant 10% reduction in CVD incidence from a 4-monthly
100 000-IU vitamin D3 dose.8 Secondary analysis of a large
trial of fracture prevention in participants with a previous
fracture found that vitamin D3 (800 IU/d) did not protect
against myocardial infarction or stroke but reduced cardiac
failure events by 25%,9 although the reduction was smaller
(18%) and nonsignificant when combined with previous
studies.9
Given the limited (and mixed) RCT evidence on vitamin
D supplementation and CVD, we performed a large RCT
with recruitment from the general population. To address
concerns about the low dose and low adherence in prior
studies,5,9 we chose a monthly high-dose vitamin D supple-
ment to determine whether it would decrease the incidence
of CVD compared with placebo.
Methods
Study Design
The Vitamin D Assessment study is a randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled trial with the primary aim
to evaluate the efficacy of monthly vitamin D supple-
mentation in reducing the incidence of CVD. The study
was approved by the New Zealand Multi-region Ethics
Committee in Wellington in October 2010 and regis-
tered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials
Registry in April 2011. Full details of the study methods
have been published.10 The trial protocol can be found in
Supplement 1.
Inclusion criteria were age of 50 to 84 years, ability
to give written informed consent, resident in Auckland,
New Zealand, at recruitment, and anticipated residence in
New Zealand for the 4-year study period. Exclusion criteria
were current use of vitamin D supplements, including cod-
liver oil (>600 IU/d if aged 50-70 years; >800 IU/d if aged
71-84 years)11; diagnosis of psychiatric disorders that would
limit ability to comply with the study protocol; history of
hypercalcemia, nephrolithiasis, sarcoidosis, parathyroid dis-
ease, or gastric bypass surgery; enrolled in another study,
which could affect participation; or baseline corrected serum
calcium level greater than 10.0 mg/dL (to convert to milli-
moles per liter, multiply by 0.25).
Recruitment of Participants and Baseline Interview
ParticipantswererecruitedinAuckland,where94%ofthepopu-
lationisregisteredwithfamilypractices.12Mostparticipantswere
recruited from 55 practices. Beginning in March 2011, a person-
alizedletterwasmailedtotheirhomes(n = 47 905)thatinvited
participationinthestudy,andof8688replies,5107individuals
remained interested and were eligible for baseline interviews.
An additional 163 potential participants from ethnic minority
communitygroupswereassessed,and143wereeligibleforbase-
lineinterviews.Atotalof5250individualsattendedthebaseline
interview (Figure 1) at The University of Auckland from April 5,
2011, through November 6, 2012.
The interview included collecting information on written
informed consent, sociodemographic status (age, sex, self-
reported race/ethnicity, highest educational level, and
current employment), lifestyle (current tobacco smoking,
alcohol drinking during the past 12 months, and usual leisure-
time physical activity13 and sun exposure14 during the past 3
months), intake of vitamin D or calcium supplements, cur-
rent medication prescribed by a physician, and medical his-
torytoldbyaphysician(includinghypertension,coronaryheart
disease, cardiac failure, cardiac arrhythmia, hyperlipidemia,
stroke, venous thrombosis, and diabetes). Height was mea-
sured to the nearest 0.1 cm and weight to the nearest 0.1 kg
(in light clothing without shoes). Brachial blood pressure was
measured after 30 minutes of rest with an OMRON T9P oscil-
lometric device (OMRON Healthcare Europe BV) on 3 occa-
sions with approximately 30 seconds between readings while
the patient was seated. A nonfasting blood sample was col-
lected to screen for hypercalcemia, with the remaining se-
rum aliquoted and stored at −80°C for later measurement of
25 hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and lipid levels.
Randomization
After the baseline interview, participants were mailed a run-in
questionnaire with a masked placebo capsule. After exclu-
sions for nonreturn of the questionnaire within 4 weeks (with
confirmation of taking the capsule) or hypercalcemia (cor-
rected serum calcium level >10.0 mg/dL), from June 3, 2011,
through January 23, 2013, a total of 5110 people (4972 from
practices and 138 from the community) were randomized to
thetreatmentgroups(Figure1).Randomassignmentwasmade
to 1 of the 2 treatment groups in random block sizes of 8, 10,
Key Points
Question Does monthly high-dose vitamin D supplementation
prevent cardiovascular disease?
Findings In a randomized clinical trial that included 5108
participants from the community, the cumulative incidence of
cardiovascular disease for a median follow-up period of 3.3 years
was 11.8% among participants given 100 000 IU of vitamin D3
monthly and 11.5% among those given placebo.
Meaning Monthly high-dose vitamin D supplementation did not
prevent cardiovascular disease and should not be used for this
purpose.

 or 12, within race/ethnic group and 5-year age strata. Treat-
ment was allocated automatically using computer genera-
tion by a study biostatistician (A.W.S.), and all other staff and
participants were masked.
Intervention
Vitamin D3 (2.5 mg or 100 000 IU) or placebo soft-gel oral
capsules (Tishcon Corporation) were mailed to participants’
homes. Two capsules were sent in the first mail delivery
after randomization (ie, 200 000-IU bolus or placebo), fol-
lowed with a 2.5-mg (100 000–IU) capsule of vitamin D3 (or
placebo) sent a month later and thereafter monthly. The aim
was to increase the serum 25(OH)D concentrations through-
out the year to 32 to 40 ng/mL (to convert to nanomoles per
liter, multiply by 2.496), which observational studies15-18 at
that time suggested was optimal for health (although subse-
quent research suggests a lower optimal threshold19). A
monthly 100 000-IU vitamin D dose was chosen because of
pharmacokinetic evidence indicating that this maintains
serum 25(OH)D levels above 35 ng/mL for a month after
ingestion.20
Capsules initially were mailed monthly to participants,
along with a 1-page questionnaire (and reply-paid envelope),
which recorded self-reported adherence and monitored re-
tention. Monthly mailings of capsules continued until June
2013, and then, from July 2013 onward, for cost reasons, 4 cap-
sules were mailed every 4 months with monthly reminders
(by email or letter) to participants to take their monthly cap-
sule. Questionnaires continued to be mailed monthly until No-
vember 2013 and then were sent 4 times monthly with 4 cap-
sules from March 2014 onward.
Follow-up and Outcomes
The Ministry of Health allocates all New Zealand residents a
uniqueNationalHealthIndexnumber,whichwasusedtotrack
deaths and hospital discharges (both with International Sta-
tistical Classification of Diseases and Health Related Problems,
Tenth Revision [ICD-10] coding), and dispensed prescriptions
(including generic name, dose, amount, and frequency) for all
participants during the follow-up period, which ended July 31,
2015. These data were used to define CVD outcomes, alone or
in combination with data about prior CVD from the baseline
interview (eTable 1 in Supplement 2).
The CVD outcomes (developed by study researchers [R.S.,
C.M.M.L.,L.T.,K.-T.K.,C.A.C.])wereincludedregardlessofhis-
tory of the same disease if they were given an A code (pri-
mary reason for hospitalization or death) for the following
diseases:chronicischemicheartdisease(ICD-10codeI25),pul-
monary embolism (ICD-10 code I26), other pulmonary dis-
eases (ICD-10 code I27), inflammatory cardiac conditions
(ICD-10 codes I30.1, I31-I41), conduction disorders (ICD-10
codes I44, I45), cardiac arrest (ICD-10 code I46), arrhythmias

 (ICD-10 codes I47-I49), ill-defined heart disease (ICD-10 code
I51), diseases of the arteries (ICD-10 codes I70-I79), and dis-
eases of the veins, including venous thrombosis (ICD-10 codes
I80-I82). For other CVDs, we also included discharges with
B codes (secondary reasons for hospitalization) in combina-
tion with baseline interview or prescription data. Acute myo-
cardial infarction was defined as ICD-10 code I21, with either
an A code regardless of prior myocardial infarction or a B code
forparticipantswithnopriormyocardialinfarction.Anginawas
defined as ICD-10 code I20 (A or B code) or initiation of ni-
trate therapy (≥2 prescriptions of glyceryl trinitrate or isosor-
bide mononitrate) after the baseline interview21 in partici-
pants who did not report a history of angina at the baseline
interview. In participants who did not report a history of heart
failure at the baseline interview, heart failure was defined as
initiation after the baseline interview of treatment with loop
diuretics, which are used specifically for this disease (≥2 pre-
scriptions of furosemide or bumetanide)21,22 or A or B code for
ICD-10 codes I11.0, I50.0, I50.1, and I50.9, and cardiomyo-
pathy was defined as A or B code for ICD-10 codes I25.5, I42.0,
and I42.7 through I42.9 (as defined previously9). Stroke was
defined as A or B code for ICD-10 codes I61 through I67 in par-
ticipants who did not report a history of stroke at baseline in-
terview. Hypertension was included as an outcome because
ofitsinclusioninapreviouscohortstudyofvitaminDandCVD3
and previous RCTs of vitamin D supplementation.23 It was de-
fined as A or B code for ICD-10 codes I10 through I15 (not oth-
erwise included in the above ICD-10 codes) in participants who
did not report that they were undergoing treatment for hyper-
tension at baseline. The primary outcome of all CVD events
combined (ICD-10 codes I10-I82) was based on the above dis-
easedefinitions.Prespecifiedsecondarydiseaseoutcomeswere
based on the cardiovascular pathophysiologic findings asso-
ciated with vitamin D deficiency and observational epidemio-
logic studies.3,4,24,25 The outcomes listed in the original study
protocol, which did not differentiate between A- and B-
coded events and did not include mention of prescriptions to
define specific diseases, were refined between the end of fol-
low-up (July 2015) and breaking of the randomization code
(February 2016), based on analyses of the Ministry of Health
databases since the start of the study by other cardiovascular
epidemiologists in our department, to include relevant CVD
events that received a B code.
Corrected serum calcium level was measured at base-
line, and serum total cholesterol and high-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol levels were measured in aliquots collected at
baseline and stored at −80°C on an Advia 2400 analyzer
(Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics). Serum 25(OH)D level,
combining vitamins D2 and D3, was measured in baseline ali-
quots stored frozen by liquid chromatography–tandem mass
spectrometry (ABSciex API 4000) with 12.7% interassay
coefficient of variation in a local laboratory participating in
the Vitamin D External Quality Assessment Scheme program
(www.deqas.org). In a 10% random sample, 438 of 515 invited
participants(85.0%)agreedtoreturnat6,12,24,and36months
forcollectionofadditionalbloodsamplestomeasurecorrected
calcium (on fresh blood) and 25(OH)D levels (in stored blood
samples, measured in the same batch for each participant).
Statistical Analysis
We estimated that a cohort of participants aged 50 to 84 years
withasimilarage,sex,andrace/ethnicdistributionasthe2006
New Zealand Census26 and with similar mortality and hospi-
tal discharge rates as for New Zealand27 would have an an-
nual CVD event rate (for hospital discharges and mortality) of
6%. Assuming that the event rate among healthy volunteers
was 80% of this, a sample of 5000 persons followed up for 4
years has a greater than 80% power (5% significance level) to
detect a 20% reduction in CVD events.
Analysis of the primary outcome (CVD) was conducted on
anintention-to-treatbasismadepossiblebytheNationalHealth
IndexnumbertoidentifyCVDeventsregardlessofwhetherpar-
ticipantscontinuedtoparticipateactivelyinthestudybyreturn-
ing the home questionnaire. The Cox proportional hazards re-
gression model, with robust sandwich variance estimates, was
used to compare the time to first CVD event in the 2 treatment
groups and to calculate CVD hazard ratios (HRs) in the placebo
group. Deaths from non-CVD causes were censored.
The treatment group differences in 25(OH)D levels were
tested for change over time with a general linear model with
repeatedtimeusinganunstructuredcorrelationmatrix.Where
indicated, season-adjusted (deseasonalized) values were cal-
culated for each participant from their individual baseline 25
(OH)D concentration and date of blood sample collection by
usingasinusoidalmodelwithvaluesderivedfrombaselineval-
ues for all participants.28 Vitamin D deficiency was defined as
having a deseasonalized 25(OH)D level less than 20 ng/mL.
Analyses were performed using SAS statistical software, ver-
sion 9.3 (SAS Institute). All statistical tests were 2-tailed with
a 5% level of significance.
Results
Baseline Characteristics, Recruitment, and Follow-up
Figure 1 shows the number of individuals assessed for eligi-
bility (n = 8851), randomized (n = 5110), and included in the
primaryanalysis(n = 5108),afterexcluding2participants(both
placebo) who withdrew consent after being randomized.
Among the 5108 patients analyzed, the mean (SD) age was 65.9
(8.3) years, 2969 (58.1%) were male, and 4253 (83.3%) were of
European or other race/ethnicity, with the remainder being
Polynesian or South Asian. A total of 2618 participants (51.3%)
were in paid employment. Only 320 (6.3%) currently smoked
tobacco, and 2173 (42.5%) were ex-smokers; 408 (8.0%) were
taking vitamin D supplements (within study eligibility crite-
ria), and 252 (4.9%) were taking calcium supplements. The
observed mean (SD) baseline 25(OH)D concentration was
25.3 (9.5) ng/mL, and the deseasonalized level was 26.5 (9.0)
ng/mL. Baseline characteristics were similar between the vi-
tamin D and placebo groups (Table 1).
Nearly all participants confirmed (by questionnaire within
2 months of randomization) that they had started taking the
studycapsule(vitaminD,2513[98.2%];placebo,2491[97.6%]),
and only 21 (0.8%) of the 2558 patients in the vitamin D group
and 49 (1.9%) of the 2550 patients in the placebo group never
confirmed this at any time during the follow-up period

 (median, 3.3 years; range, 2.5-4.2 years). By the end of follow-
up, 123 participants (2.4%) had died, whereas 4032 (78.9%) re-
turned the final July 2015 questionnaire, and an additional 283
(5.5%) returned the penultimate March 2015 questionnaire,
confirming that of those still alive (4315 [86.6%]) were ac-
tively participating during the last five months of follow-up.
25(OH)D Levels During Follow-up
Mean observed 25(OH)D concentrations are given in Table 2
for the randomly selected participants who returned to have
blood samples obtained. These concentrations were greater
than 20 ng/mL higher in the treated group compared with the
placebo group in the blood samples collected at 6 months, up
to 36 months of follow-up; these findings confirm the high ad-
herencereportedinthehomequestionnaires,whichwas84.9%
in the vitamin D group and 82.9% in the placebo group (83.9%
overall, 168 667 capsules reported having been taken during
200 936 person-months). Mean (SD) corrected serum cal-
cium levels throughout the follow-up period were similar for
the vitamin D vs placebo groups (9.2 [0.4] vs 9.2 [0.4] mg/dL
at 6, 12, and 24 months and 9.6 [0.4] vs 9.6 [0.4] mg/dL at 36
months). Only 1 person developed hypercalcemia (corrected
serum calcium level >10.4 mg/dL), which was from primary
hyperparathyroidism; the participant continued taking the

Discussion
The results of this large population-based RCT indicate that
vitamin D supplementation given in the dose and frequency
we used does not prevent CVD, and the findings are consis-
tent with previous RCTs of vitamin D supplementation5,9
and mendelian randomization studies.29,30 However, it
remains possible that monthly doses of vitamin D are less
effective in preventing disease than daily or weekly doses.
Recommendation for the desired frequency of vitamin D
dosing has changed from when our study began, at which
time it was considered that a bolus dose of vitamin D would
be stored as vitamin D for later conversion to 25(OH)D31 and
that monthly dosing was frequent enough to avoid any
increase in the catabolism of the active metabolite (1,25-

 dihydroxyvitamin D) in nonrenal tissues.32 In contrast,
recent reviews have concluded that vitamin D is more acces-
sible for internalization into cells than 25(OH)D,33 and in our
study, vitamin D would only have been in the blood circula-
tion for several days after each monthly dose because of its
shorter half-life.34 Other trials, which are giving vitamin D
monthly (eg, D-Health, The International Polycap Study 3)35
or daily (eg, Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial),36 will help clarify
whether dosing frequency is important.
Our results do not support the findings from observa-
tional studies2,3 that report an inverse association between 25
(OH)D and CVD, which could be explained by residual con-
founding from other lifestyle risk factors. It is possible that 25
(OH)D concentrations are a surrogate marker of sun exposure,
which may have other health effects entirely separate from vi-
tamin D.37 Thus, we caution against closure of this topic, given
the descriptive epidemiologic findings on inverse associa-
tions between solar radiation and CVD with regard to season,
latitude, and altitude.38-40
Strengths and Limitations
Our study has several strengths that enhance the validity of
the conclusions. First, we had a high retention rate, with
87% still participating actively in the final follow-up period.
Second, we had high adherence, with 84% of capsules
reported taken in questionnaires, confirmed by the high
serum 25(OH)D concentrations in the vitamin D group of the
measured subgroup (Table 2). Third, the mean 25(OH)D con-
centration greater than 40 ng/mL in the vitamin D group
confirmed the adequacy of the vitamin D dose, particularly
the greater than 20-ng/mL difference compared with the
placebo arm.
Our study also has some potential limitations. The event
ratewaslowerthanexpected,aswasthefollow-uptime,which
decreased the number of expected events from 890 to the 596
observed; therefore, the power to detect a 20% reduction was
75% (5% significance), which is equivalent to 80% power to
detect a 21% reduction. However, this is unlikely to have
changed our main conclusion because our point estimate of
effect for the primary end point was close to 1 (Table 3), sup-
porting a null finding. The study had much less power to de-
tect benefits for the subgroup with vitamin D deficiency and
for preventing specific CVD outcomes, such as heart failure,
as reported in previous RCTs.9,41 Our funding only allowed for
median follow-up of 3.3 years, and we cannot exclude pos-
sible longer-term beneficial effects from vitamin D supple-
mentation. Our outcome measures were not adjudicated, but
this is an unlikely explanation for our null findings because the
validity of our outcome is indicated by the expected associa-
tions with risk factors in the placebo group (eTable 2 in the
Supplement) and by research indicating that the CVD hospi-
talization data from the Ministry of Health have good agree-
mentwiththeFraminghamriskfactorequationinEuropeans.42
Furthermore,wewereunabletoidentifyparticipantswhoemi-
grated during the study. However, our inability to record over-
seas CVD events is unlikely to have changed our findings be-
cause the number of CVD events not recorded is likely to have
been small based on our annual 4% incidence rate, whereas
thenumberofparticipantswhoemigratedislikelytohavebeen
small based on the high retention rate in the final study pe-
riod (when 87% of participants returned questionnaires).
Conclusions
This study found that monthly high-dose vitamin D supple-
mentation does not prevent CVD. The effects of daily or weekly
dosing on CVD risk require further study.

Editor's Note
Integrating Research With Clinical Practice
Keeping It Simple
Adrian F. Hernandez, MD, MHS; Robert A. Harrington, MD; Christopher J. O'
Donnell, MD, MPH
In this issue of JAMA Cardiology, Scragg et al1 present the re-
sults from a large, simple trial evaluating the effect of monthly
high-dose vitamin D supplementation on cardiovascular out-
comes. Using a randomized,
double-blind, placebo-con-
trolled trial design of more
than 5000 participants re-
cruited from a community of family practices of approxi-
mately 50 000 adults, the investigators showed that high-
dose vitamin D supplementation given monthly did not
improve the incidence of cardiovascular disease or death com-
paredwithplacebo.WhileaverdictonuseofvitaminDsupple-
mentationforcardiovascularpreventionawaitsresultsofother
ongoing trials, this trial does not support there being a net ben-
efit from a monthly high-dose administration of vitamin D.
What makes this trial interesting and important is 2-fold.
First,answeringcommon,everydayquestionssuchaswhether
vitaminsupplementationthatcanbereadilyaccessibleandeas-
ily implemented may have a profound public health impact.
Second, the design of the study takes advantage of routine
health care. Participants were recruited from existing family
practices in the community at a relatively high rate of partici-
pation. The study drug was mailed directly to participants, and
follow-up was seamless as participants encountered the health
system, with data generated at every hospital stay.
