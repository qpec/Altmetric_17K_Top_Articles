Purpose:
To investigate the association of weight loss with progres-
sion of cartilage changes at magnetic resonance (MR) 
imaging over 48 months in overweight and obese partici-
pants compared with participants of stable weight.
Materials and 
Methods:
The institutional review boards of the four participating 
centers approved this HIPAA-compliant study. Included 
were (a) 640 participants (mean age, 62.9 years 6 9.1 
[standard deviation]; 398 women) who were overweight 
or obese (body mass index cutpoints of 25 and 30 kg/m2, 
respectively) from the Osteoarthritis Initiative, with risk 
factors for osteoarthritis or mild to moderate radiographic 
findings of osteoarthritis, categorized into groups with (a) 
weight loss of more than 10% (n = 82), (b) weight loss of 
5%–10% (n = 238), or (c) stable weight (n = 320) over 
48 months. Participants were frequency-matched for age, 
sex, baseline body mass index, and Kellgren-Lawrence 
score. Two radiologists assessed cartilage and meniscus 
defects on right knee 3-T MR images at baseline and 48 
months by using the modified Whole-Organ Magnetic Res-
onance Imaging Score (WORMS). Progression of the sub-
scores was compared between the weight loss groups by 
using multivariable logistic regression models.
Results:
Over 48 months, adjusted mean increase of cartilage 
WORMS was significantly smaller in the 5%–10% weight 
loss group (1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3, 1.9; 
P = .002) and even smaller in the group with more than 
10% weight loss (1.0; 95% CI: 0.6, 1.4; P = .001) when 
compared with the stable weight group (2.3; 95% CI: 2.0, 
2.7). Moreover, percentage of weight change was signifi-
cantly associated with increase in cartilage WORMS (b = 
0.2; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.4; P = .007).
Conclusion:
Participants who lost weight over 48 months showed sig-
nificantly lower cartilage degeneration, as assessed with 
MR imaging; rates of progression were lower with greater 
weight loss.

of osteoarthritis in comparison with 
stable-weight participants.
Materials and Methods
Database and Participants
Participants were selected from the 
Osteoarthritis Initiative ([OAI] http://
www.oai.ucsf.edu), a prospective mul-
ticenter cohort study of healthy partici-
pants with or without risk factors for or 
with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. 
Informed consent was obtained from all 
participants; the study was compliant 
with the Health Insurance Portability 
and Accountability Act and was ap-
proved by the local institutional review 
boards of all participating centers. Par-
ticipants were recruited from February 
2004 until May 2006.
Complete BMI data for baseline and 
12-, 24-, and 48-month follow-up were 
available for 4526 study participants. 
Of those, we excluded participants 
with a baseline Kellgren-Lawrence 
score higher than 3 in the right knee, 
associated with exacerbation of knee 
joint degeneration, especially with 
worsening cartilage and meniscal de-
generation over 48 months, when com-
pared with stable weight (18).
On the other hand, weight loss is 
associated with reduced cartilage vol-
ume loss within the medial tibia (19). 
In addition, participants who lose 
weight have been shown to have less of 
an increase in cartilage T2 relaxation 
time, suggesting less cartilage dete-
rioration over 48 months when com-
pared with stable-weight participants, 
as detected with compositional MR 
imaging; this modality depicts molec-
ular changes, such as decrease in gly-
cosaminoglycan content and increase 
in water content in the extracellular 
matrix, that precede morphologic 
cartilage lesions (20). Weight change 
was also significantly associated with 
change in cartilage composition in the 
medial tibia and in Western Ontario 
and McMaster Universities Arthritis 
Index (WOMAC) subscales for pain 
and disability in obese and overweight 
individuals (21). Nevertheless, to our 
knowledge, the effect of weight loss on 
the morphologic degeneration of knee 
joint tissues has not been assessed. 
MR imaging is the most sensitive 
modality with which to depict subtle 
morphologic abnormalities, and it can 
reveal early structural osteoarthritic 
findings, including cartilage and menis-
cus defects (22–24).
Thus, we hypothesized that differ-
ent degrees of weight loss have differ-
ent effects on the progression of mor-
phologic abnormalities of the knee joint 
detected with 3-T MR imaging over 48 
months in obese or overweight persons 
with risk factors for osteoarthritis or 
mild to moderate radiographic findings

Advances in Knowledge
 
n Progression of knee cartilage ab-
normalities, as detected with MR 
imaging, was significantly 
decreased in obese and over-
weight participants at risk for or 
with mild to moderate osteoar-
thritis who had a decrease in 
body mass index of at least 5% 
over 48 months when compared 
with that in participants without 
weight loss (P = .002).
 
n The amount of weight change 
was significantly associated with 
the progression of cartilage ab-
normalities (P = .007).
Implication for Patient Care
 
n Weight loss is associated with a 
reduced risk for progression of 
cartilage, as detected with MR 
imaging; thus, weight loss is a 
potential therapeutic option in 
patients with mild to moderate 
osteoarthritis and in those who 
are at risk for osteoarthritis.
O
steoarthritis is the most common 
joint disease in the United States, 
affecting more than 50% of the 
population aged 75 years or more (1). 
Obese women have nearly four times 
and obese men have five times the risk 
for knee osteoarthritis when compared 
with women and men of normal weight 
(2). Overweight and obesity are defined 
by using the body mass index ([BMI] 
weight in kilograms divided by height 
in square meters), with cutoff points of 
25 and 30 kg/m2, respectively (3). The 
association between obesity and oste-
oarthritis is caused biomechanically by 
increased joint loading (4–7) and alter-
ations in gait patterns and systemically 
by metabolic factors that frequently oc-
cur in obese patients and during weight 
gain (8) and that may impair cartilage 
homeostasis and cause systemic and 
local inflammation (9–11). Acceleration 
of cartilage degeneration and worsen-
ing of clinical symptoms are associated 
with obesity (12,13), a condition that 
affects approximately 36% of the U.S. 
population older than 20 years (14) and 
therefore is of substantial public health 
importance.
Previous studies have found corre-
lations between progression of changes 
in knee cartilage detected with mag-
netic resonance (MR) imaging and clin-
ical symptoms and BMI (15,16); these 
correlations underline the fact that 
the potentially modifiable risk factor 
of obesity may contribute to the risk 
for osteoarthritis (17). Weight gain is

Gersing et al
Through use of the Charlson comor-
bidity questionnaire developed by Katz 
et al (25,26), participants with cancer, 
cardiac failure, and/or other severe 
diseases developing during the study 
period were excluded. Furthermore, 
we excluded participants with missing 
clinical MR imaging studies at baseline 
(n = 24) or at 48 months (n = 384). 
The remaining participants (n = 1597) 
were grouped according to the per-
centage of weight loss over 48 months. 
Groups were as follows: stable weight 
irregular weight change who cycled 
through weight loss and weight gain pe-
riods over 48 months (n = 84). To ac-
complish this last exclusion, we calcu-
lated the annual rate of change in BMI 
over 4 years with a linear regression 
model and categorized participants into 
a group with a steady weight change 
trajectory and a group with an irregular 
weight change, defined as those with 
root mean square error of the regres-
sion line of their weight change above 
the 95th percentile.
representing end-stage osteoarthritis (n 
= 227); those with rheumatoid arthritis 
developing during study follow-up (n = 
7); and those with a baseline BMI less 
than 25 kg/m2 (n = 1048), in order to 
focus on only overweight and obese 
persons (Fig 1).
To clearly distinguish between sta-
ble-weight and weight loss groups, we 
excluded participants with weight gain 
of more than 3%, those with weight 
loss of 3%–5% from baseline to 48 
months (n = 1155), and those with

details regarding the MR imaging se-
quences are available in the OAI MR 
protocol (34).
Image Analysis
All baseline and 48-month follow-up im-
ages were individually and independently 
read by two radiologists (A.S.G., B.J.S.; 
each with 5 years of experience) blinded 
to patient information and time point 
information of the images they were as-
sessing. Moreover, they read the images 
in a random fashion, with a random or-
der to the time points. In case of diverg-
ing findings (n = 82), a consensus reading 
was performed with a third board-certi-
fied musculoskeletal radiologist (T.M.L., 
24 years of experience). The images were 
evaluated for three osteoarthritis features 
by using the semiquantitative WORMS 
grading system (35), modified as previ-
ously described (18,36): Meniscal defects 
were graded from 0 to 4 in each of the 
three subregions of the medial and lateral 
meniscus (anterior, body, and posterior). 
The meniscal defects and abnormalities 
were graded according to the WORMS 
subscale from 0 to 4 (0 = intact, 1 = intra-
substance signal abnormalities, 2 = non-
displaced tear, 3 = displaced or complex 
tear, 4 = maceration). The meniscal tears 
were further categorized into radial, ver-
tical, horizontal, flap, bucket handle, me-
niscocapsular, root tear, extrusion, and 
others.
Cartilage defects were scored from 
0 to 6, and bone marrow edema pat-
terns (BMEPs) were scored from 0 to 3 
in the same six regions (patella, troch-
lea, medial femur, lateral femur, medial 
tibia, and lateral tibia). For each subscale 
(WORMS cartilage, meniscus, BMEP), a 
sum score was calculated by adding the 
scores of all subregions of each knee 
(37).
Statistical Analyses
Statistical analyses were performed 
by using Stata software, version 13.1 
previous study (15) showed a 44% prev-
alence of cartilage defects in participants 
with normal weight (n = 36) compared 
with a 72% prevalence in obese partici-
pants (n = 69). The criterion for signif-
icance had been set at .05; therefore, 
to reach a power of 0.90, a minimum 
of 72 participants in each group would 
be required. Thus, we included all eligi-
ble participants available within the two 
weight loss groups to ensure that group 
sizes were adequate for the comparison.
Knee pain and function were as-
sessed by using the WOMAC Osteo-
arthritis Index (30), which quantifies 
pain, stiffness, and physical function 
(30). This well-established and validated 
questionnaire was administered yearly 
to all 4796 participants in a standard-
ized manner.
Physical activity levels were measured 
by using the Physical Activity Scale for the 
Elderly (PASE) questionnaire. This well-
established instrument (31,32) yields a 
numeric score and is used to assess three 
domains of physical activity over a period 
of 7 days (household, occupational, and 
leisure activities). Participants completed 
the questionnaire on the same day as 
their MR imaging examination. The PASE 
questionnaire has been validated in older 
and younger persons (31–33).
MR Imaging
MR images of the right knee were ob-
tained by using identical 3-T imagers 
(Trio; Siemens, Munich, Germany) and 
quadrature transmit-receive coils (USA 
Instruments, Aurora, Ohio) at four 
sites (Ohio State University, Columbus, 
Ohio; University of Maryland School of 
Medicine, Baltimore, Md; University of 
Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pa; and Memo-
rial Hospital of Rhode Island, Pawtuck-
et, RI). The following four sequences 
were used for the imaging analysis: (a) 
two-dimensional intermediate-weighted 
fast spin-echo sequence in the coro-
nal plane (repetition time msec/echo 
time msec, 3700/29; field of view, 140 
mm; matrix, 310 3 384); (b) two-
dimensional proton density–weighted 
fast spin-echo sequences with fat sup-
pression in the sagittal plane (3200/30; 
field of view, 160 mm; matrix, 314 3 
448); (c) three-dimensional dual-echo 
(BMI change ,3%, n = 1277), moder-
ate weight loss (BMI decrease of 5%–
10% [referred to hereafter as 5%–10% 
weight loss], n = 238), and substantial 
weight loss (BMI decrease .10%, n = 
82). The weight loss groups were cho-
sen on the basis of the weight loss goals 
of previous studies (5% weight loss in 
the Arthritis, Diet, and Activity Promo-
tion Trial study; 10% in the Intensive 
Diet and Exercise for Arthritis study) 
(27–29), which suggest that these 
thresholds reflect the minimal amount 
of weight loss needed to improve clini-
cal outcome (pain and function) in pa-
tients with knee osteoarthritis.
To perform frequency matching be-
tween the stable-weight group and the 
weight loss groups, we sorted these par-
ticipants into groups based on sex (male 
or female), age (10-year strata from 
45 to 65 years and one 14-year stra-
tum from 65 to 79 years), baseline BMI 
(BMI in 2.5 kg/m2 strata), and Kellgren-
Lawrence score (score in strata of 0/1 
and 2/3). Participants with stable weight 
were randomly selected from each stra-
tum and were frequency-matched to 
participants from the combined weight 
loss groups for these age, sex, base-
line BMI, and Kellgren-Lawrence score 
groups. For each participant in each 
weight loss group, one participant with 
stable weight was selected. Thus, the 
final group sizes were 238 participants 
in the 5%–10% weight loss group, 82 in 
the more than 10% weight loss group, 
and 320 in the stable weight group.
An a priori power analysis was 
calculated on the basis of our previ-
ous study evaluating the differences in 
cartilage Whole-Organ Magnetic Res-
onance Imaging Score (WORMS) be-
tween obese participants and partici-
pants with normal weight (15); this was 
done to determine the appropriate size 
of each subgroup to analyze differences 
between the groups. After matching the 
participants, we ensured that the stable 
weight and weight loss groups did not 
differ regarding medications influencing 
metabolic factors, such as antihyperten-
sive medication, diabetic medication or 
insulin, or lipid-lowering medication (eg, 
statins or other), which have been re-
ported to affect cartilage degradation. A

5%–10% weight loss group lost 2.13 
kg/m2 6 1.21 on average, and the over-
all BMI in the stable weight reference 
group remained almost unchanged, 
with an increase of 0.08 kg/m2 6 0.97. 
In addition, the severity of morpho-
logic knee abnormalities (WORMS 
cartilage, menisci, and BMEP) at base-
line did not significantly differ between 
groups (P  .017 for each) (Table 2).
Change of Cartilage, Meniscal, and BMEP 
WORMS over 48 Months
Participants with more than 10% weight 
loss showed significantly lower odds of 
progression on the overall WORMS 
cartilage subscore over 48 months 
when compared with stable weight par-
ticipants (sum of all cartilage compart-
ments subscales; odds ratio, 0.34; 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 0.20, 0.60; P , 
.001) (Table 3); however, the odds were 
not significantly lower for the compar-
ison between the 5%–10% weight loss 
group and the stable weight group (odds 
ratio, 0.76; 95% CI: 0.54, 1.07; P = .1). 
Adjusted mean increase in the global 
WORMS cartilage subscore over 48 
months was significantly smaller in the 
5%–10% weight loss group (cartilage 
WORMS5%–10%WLG, 1.6; 95% CI: 1.3, 
1.9; P = .002) and even smaller in the 
group with more than 10% weight loss 
(cartilage WORMS.10%WLG, 1.0; 95% CI: 
0.6, 1.4; P = .001) when compared with 
the group with stable weight (cartilage 
months (WORMS subscore . 0), as 
previously defined (38,39).
In a separate analysis, participants 
were categorized as overweight (BMI of 
25–30 kg/m2) or obese (BMI .30 kg/
m2) according to their BMI at baseline, 
and logistic regression analyses with 
WORMS subscale summary scores 
were repeated.
The intra- and interreader repro-
ducibility of WORMS grading was as-
sessed for each time point (baseline 
or 48 months) by using 20 partici-
pants who were randomly selected; 
this was separately evaluated by both 
radiologists (A.S.G., B.J.S.), who were 
blinded to time point and patient infor-
mation. Interreader intraclass correla-
tion coefficients (ICCs) were calculated 
for each WORMS subscore (cartilage, 
meniscus, and BMEP). After at least 2 
weeks, each radiologist repeated the 
same WORMS gradings once again the 
same way. Intrareader ICCs were cal-
culated to compare each WORMS sub-
score (cartilage, meniscus, and BMEP).
Results
Participant Characteristics
Baseline 
participant 
characteristics 
are presented in Table 1. After 48 
months, participants in the more than 
10% weight loss group lost 4.62 kg/m2 
6 1.92 on average, participants in the 
(Stata, College Station, Tex). Analyses 
were performed by using only the con-
sensus readings in the models. To re-
duce the possibility of type I error due to 
multiple testing, we used the Bonferroni 
correction, and P  .017 (0.05 4 3 be-
cause there are three pairwise compari-
sons among the groups) was considered 
to indicate significance for the analyses 
that compared the parameters between 
the three groups. Differences in char-
acteristics between participants with 
stable weight and those with 5%–10% 
weight loss and those with more than 
10% weight loss were evaluated sepa-
rately by using one-way analysis of var-
iance (parametric testing) and x2 tests 
(categorical variables). Multivariable lin-
ear regression models adjusting for age, 
sex, baseline BMI, Kellgren-Lawrence 
score, and WOMAC and PASE scores 
were used to compare means of base-
line WORMS subscores and increase 
of WORMS subscores of each weight 
loss group separately (5%–10% weight 
loss, .10% weight loss) with those in 
the group with stable weight (indepen-
dent variable, group assignment; out-
come variable, mean baseline WORMS 
parameters).
Associations of increases in WORMS 
subscores (increase in cartilage, me-
niscus, and BMEP subscores over 48 
months) with weight change over 48 
months were assessed by using multivari-
able regression models adjusting for age, 
sex, baseline BMI, Kellgren-Lawrence 
score, and WOMAC and PASE scores 
in all participants (independent variable, 
percentage of BMI change, outcome var-
iable: increase of WORMS parameters).
Logistic regression models adjusted 
for age, sex, baseline BMI, Kellgren-
Lawrence score, and WOMAC and 
PASE scores were used to estimate odds 
ratios for the progression of WORMS 
subscores for cartilage, menisci, and 
BMEP and to compare participants with 
stable weight and those who lost weight 
(5%–10% weight loss and .10% weight 
loss). The outcome variable for the sub-
scores for cartilage, menisci, and BMEP 
was participants with no changes in joint 
structure over 48 months (DWORMS 
subscore = 0) versus participants with 
increases in joint structure over 48

(Table 4). This was consistent with 
lower cartilage degeneration in both 
weight loss groups over 48 months. 
Moreover, percentage of weight change 
was significantly associated with the 
amount of WORMS cartilage increase 
(b = 0.2; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.4; P = .007), 
demonstrating that for every 1% of 
weight loss there was 0.2-point lower 
increase in WORMS cartilage over 48 
months (Table 5).
In analyses of specific articular re-
gions, the odds of progression for the 
WORMS cartilage subscale in the me-
dial tibia were significantly lower in 
both weight loss groups than in the sta-
ble weight group (5%–10% weight loss: 
odds ratio, 0.39 [95% CI: 0.20, 0.76; P 
= .005]; .10% weight loss: odds ratio, 
0.16 [95% CI: 0.01, 0.40; P = .001]) 
(Fig 2), consistent with lower cartilage 
degeneration 
in 
participants 
with 
weight loss compared with those with 
stable weight over 48 months. Increase 
in the WORMS cartilage subscale in 
the medial tibia in the group with more 
than 10% weight loss was significantly 
smaller than that in the group with sta-
ble weight (P = .006) (Table 4, Fig 3

more than 10% weight loss and with 30% 
lower odds of such worsening in the 5%–

with the stable weight group; however, 
these comparisons reached significance 
only in the group with more than 10%

did not differ between the stable weight

well as maceration of the meniscus, P

MUSCULOSKELETAL IMAGING: Changes in Knee Cartilage after Weight Loss in Obese and Overweight Patients 
Gersing et al
Figure 2
Figure 2: MR images of the right knee obtained with the coronal proton density–weighted fast spin-echo fat-
suppression sequence at, A, C, baseline and, B, D, after 48 months. Patients were an obese 65-year-old woman with 
stable weight and mild knee pain ( 
WOMAC pain subscale score of 3 at baseline; baseline BMI, 33.1 kg/m2) (A and B 
) 
and an obese 64-year-old woman with weight loss over 48 months and mild knee pain (approximately 10.9% decrease 
in BMI; WOMAC pain subscale score of 5 at baseline; baseline BMI, 33.7 kg/m2) (C and D 
). The woman with stable 
weight developed a full-thickness focal cartilage defect at the medial tibia (arrow) (baseline cartilage WORMS grade 0 
in A and 2.5 in B 
). In contrast, no cartilage defects were detected at baseline or 48-month follow-up in the woman with 
weight loss (cartilage WORMS grade 0 in C and D 
).
The odds of BMEP progression 
were 61% lower for participants with 
more than 10% weight loss than for 
participants with stable weight (.10% 
weight loss: odds ratio, 0.39; 95% CI: 
0.20, 0.74; P = .004); however, no 
significant differences were found be-
tween the participants with 5%–10% 
weight loss and those with stable 
weight (P = .9).
In separate analyses of overweight 
and obese participants, those with a 
BMI of 25–30 kg/m2 who lost more 
than 10% of their weight showed 
significantly lower odds of overall 
cartilage worsening compared with 
overweight participants with stable 
weight (odds ratio, 0.34; 95% CI: 
0.16, 0.68; P = .003) (Table 6); how-
ever, no significant differences were 
found between participants with sta-
ble weight and obese participants 
(BMI .30 kg/m2). In overweight par-
ticipants, odds of meniscal worsening 
were significantly lower in participants 
with more than 10% weight loss (odds 
ratio, 0.32; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.77; P = 
.011) compared with those with stable 
weight. In obese individuals, the odds 
of BMEP worsening were significantly 
lower in the group with more than 
10% weight loss (odds ratio, 0.24; 
95% CI: 0.08, 0.67; P = .006) than in 
the stable weight group.

Discussion
In our study, the amount of weight loss 
was significantly associated with re-
duced risk for progression of cartilage 
defects over 48 months detected with 
MR imaging in 640 obese and over-
weight participants. Moreover, obese 
and overweight participants with weight 
loss showed lower progression of menis-
cal defects over 48 months than did 
participants in the weight-matched sta-
ble-weight reference group. After par-
ticipants were classified into two groups

MUSCULOSKELETAL IMAGING: Changes in Knee Cartilage after Weight Loss in Obese and Overweight Patients 
Gersing et al
were substantially smaller than our 
overall study cohort. Thus, the results 
of our study, which show differences 
in the progression of cartilage changes 
detected via use of morphologic MR 
imaging averaged over all compart-
ments, as well as in the patella, and 
regarding the progression of menis-
cal defects, were not evident in these 
previous studies because of shorter 
observation periods and smaller study 
cohorts. In other previous studies, 
varus alignment has been attributed 
to intensifying the effect of obesity on 
osteoarthritis progression at the me-
dial tibiofemoral joint compared with 
other lower extremity joints (45). 
However, the literature is inconsis-
tent regarding the effects of obesity 
and risk factors, such as malalignment 
(46). Another study showed that obe-
sity increases the risk for progression 
in especially varus-aligned extremities 
(47). Previous studies have shown that 
the medial compartment in general is 
exposed to higher rates of cartilage 
loss in people with osteoarthritis, 
which could be attributed to a greater 
proportion of ground reaction forces 
by the medial tibiofemoral compart-
ment even in normally aligned knees 
(40,48).
To our knowledge, our study is 
the first to longitudinally examine the 
association between weight loss and 
progression of morphologic knee joint 
abnormalities, including cartilage and 
meniscal defects, as well as BMEP, 
over 48 months. In a previous study 
with mostly overweight and obese 
participants, both elevated cartilage 
T2 values (assessed with composi-
tional MR imaging and indicating very 
early molecular changes) and cartilage 
abnormalities were associated with 
knee pain (49). Associations between 
cartilage degeneration and pain have 
also been demonstrated previously 
(49–51). This may be due to increased 
stress on the subchondral bone be-
cause cartilage itself does not contain 
any nociceptors. Our findings—that 
weight loss is associated with less pro-
gression of morphologic cartilage de-
fects and other osteoarthritic chang-
es—therefore emphasize the relevance 
in younger patients (41). Moreover, sev-
eral studies have previously shown that 
meniscus defects and cartilage loss are 
more prevalent within the medial com-
partment (42,43), overall indicating 
that medial osteoarthritis occurs more 
frequently than lateral osteoarthritis 
(44). Thus, it has been hypothesized 
that weight loss as a lifestyle interven-
tion might show the strongest protec-
tive effect in this weight-bearing region 
(19). Our regional analyses, showing 
strong associations for the medial tibia, 
support this hypothesis.
Our findings also show that the 
amount of weight loss is associ-
ated with the amount of increase in 
WORMS subscores over 48 months. 
Similarly, previously investigators re-
ported that the percentage of weight 
loss is significantly associated with 
change in cartilage volume (19) and 
composition (40) of the medial tibia. 
However, in the previous studies, par-
ticipants were followed up within a 
very inhomogeneous and shorter pe-
riod of time, and the study cohorts 
with different degrees of weight loss, 
the group with a substantial amount of 
weight loss (.10% weight loss) showed 
significantly lower odds of cartilage de-
generation when compared with the 
stable-weight reference group, whereas 
the odds were not significantly lower 
when we compared the 5%–10% weight 
loss group with the stable-weight group. 
These findings suggest that a larger 
amount of weight loss is more bene-
ficial for cartilage than is moderate or 
no weight loss. Both weight loss groups 
showed reduced cartilage degeneration 
in the medial tibia, which supports the 
hypothesis that weight loss is most pro-
tective for the weight-bearing regions 
(19,40). Weight loss was especially 
 
associated with reduced progression 
 
of cartilage and meniscal defects in 
 
the overweight individuals (BMI, 25–30 
kg/m2).
A recent study has shown that over-
weight and obesity are associated with 
greater vertical loading rates (7) and in-
creased risk for total knee replacement 
surgery, with the strongest associations

MUSCULOSKELETAL IMAGING: Changes in Knee Cartilage after Weight Loss in Obese and Overweight Patients 
Gersing et al
were lower in the overweight cohort; 
this finding suggests that weight loss 
could be especially beneficial in this 
highly prevalent weight group. These 
results may be explained by changes in 
dynamic joint loading through weight 
loss because weight loss may cause de-
creased loading and shear stress on the 
menisci (58) (the primary functions of 
the meniscus is to serve as a shock 
absorber and to provide load bearing 
in the joint [59]). The occurrence of 
meniscal tears may impair these func-
tions, causing increased stress in the 
knee joint (60,61). Meniscal tears alter 
whole joint kinematics and shift the 
mechanical stress distribution in the 
surrounding structures, including the 
cartilage. Previous studies showed that 
meniscus abnormalities are associated 
with pain (52), suggesting that the 
impairment of joint mechanics of the 
knee may be associated with the devel-
opment of symptoms. Consequently, 
less worsening of meniscal degener-
ation in the group with substantial 
weight loss compared with the stable 
weight group could affect the progres-
sion of clinical symptoms differently 
within the groups. In addition, weight 
loss seems to decrease the production 
of proinflammatory adipocytokines, 
which contribute to meniscal and 
cartilage degeneration. However, ad-
ditional studies analyzing the serologic 
and biomechanical effects of weight 
loss are needed to further investigate 
these mechanisms (10,62).
Our study had limitations, including 
the lack of clinical metrics as an out-
come measure. Moreover, our study 
was a retrospective analysis of the 
weight loss of participants included 
in the OAI, and analyses did not con-
sider methods and weight loss regi-
mens used, including diet, exercise, 
or bariatric surgery. This is a major 
limitation of our study and may have 
introduced confounding effects into 
our analysis that cannot be estimated 
because different regimens may have 
different effects on joint structures (eg, 
cartilage health might develop differ-
ently in participants starting a rigorous 
exercise training program compared 
with participants undergoing bariatric 
effect in patients with weight gain (18). 
However, given the inconsistency in the 
previous literature, caution is needed in 
estimating the clinical relevance of as-
sociations between weight loss and MR 
findings over time.
Although a previous study showed 
that in patients with a meniscal tear 
weight loss caused a reduction of pain 
and cartilage loss (10), to our knowl-
edge, no study has assessed the asso-
ciation between progression of menis-
cal degeneration and weight loss, as is 
demonstrated in our study. When we 
looked at overweight participants sepa-
rately in comparison with participants 
with stable weight, odds of worsening 
of lifestyle interventions in obese and 
overweight individuals regarding joint 
degeneration as detected with MR im-
aging and clinical outcome, such as 
knee pain.
Regarding the subchondral bone, 
the literature is inconsistent. Some 
studies have shown strong associa-
tions between the presence of BMEPs 
and the development of pain (52–54), 
whereas others have shown no associa-
tion (55–57). Our findings suggest less 
progression of BMEPs in participants 
with substantial weight loss compared 
with stable-weight participants, which 
is in line with the findings of a previ-
ous study that showed the opposite

woman with stable weight and mild knee pain (WOMAC pain subscale score of 5 at baseline; baseline BMI, 
31.4 kg/m2) (A, B) and an obese 59-year-old woman with weight loss (approximately 8.5% decrease in BMI) 
over 48 months and mild knee pain (WOMAC pain subscale score of 6 at baseline; baseline BMI, 32.1 kg/
m2) (C, D). The woman with stable weight developed a maceration of the medial meniscus (arrow) (medial 
meniscus WORMS of grade 0 in A and grade 4 in B 
) and thinning of the cartilage of the medial femoral 
condyle. In contrast, no meniscal defects (arrows) were seen on C or D (medial meniscus WORMS grade 0) in 
the participant with weight loss.

MUSCULOSKELETAL IMAGING: Changes in Knee Cartilage after Weight Loss in Obese and Overweight Patients 
Gersing et al
bore or the MR imaging knee coil be-
cause of their body size were excluded 
from this study, which may have caused 
a selection bias. Finally, WORMS has 
limited sensitivity in the detection of 
subtle changes of cartilage defect sizes 
over time because changes may not be 
reflected by an increase in the WORMS 
subscale if they are too subtle to cause 
a difference in the score. Biochemical 
metrics (eg, T2 or T1r mapping) are 
more sensitive regarding these sub-
tle changes. The additional evaluation 
with quantitative assessment, such as 
cartilage volumetry, and biochemical 
metrics may yield more detailed in-
formation on cartilage degenerative 
disease.
In summary, our study showed 
that weight loss was significantly as-
sociated with reduced progression of 
knee cartilage and meniscal degener-
ation in obese and overweight individ-
uals with risk factors for osteoarthri-
tis or mild to moderate radiographic 
evidence of osteoarthritis. Our find-
ings suggest that weight loss may have 
a protective effect on knee cartilage 
and menisci and that greater weight 
loss may be even more beneficial for 
knee joint health in obese and over-
weight individuals.

yet we found no significant differences 
between the stable weight and weight 
loss groups regarding the use of antihy-
pertensive medication, diabetic medi-
cation or insulin, or lipid-lowering med-
ication (eg, statins). Because our study 
was retrospective, conclusions regard-
ing causation between weight loss and 
progression of cartilage abnormalities 
may not be drawn from our results. A 
prospective study would be required to 
validate our results.
Of the potential study participants 
identified in the OAI, 384 dropped out 
of the study and did not undergo fol-
low-up MR imaging after 4 years. It is 
unknown whether any of these partici-
pants underwent total knee arthroplas-
ty. This limitation of the OAI study may 
have introduced a bias to our analyses. 
Moreover, because most participants 
reported their right leg to be the dom-
inant leg (92.2%), we assessed the MR 
imaging examinations for the right leg 
only, which may have introduced a bias 
to the analyses as well. In addition, only 
participants in whom MR imaging could 
be performed were included in the OAI 
study; thus, participants who had is-
sues with fitting into the MR imaging 
surgery). Yet, the only statistical trend 
found in the previous assessment of 
structural knee abnormalities and dif-
ferent types of weight loss (exercise, 
diet, and diet combined with exercise) 
was a beneficial effect for both dietary 
groups regarding progression of BMEP 
(63). Of note, this previous study was 
performed over a much shorter period, 
which may explain the lack of differ-
ences between cartilage thickness and 
volume, as well as the denuded area, 
between the groups with different 
weight loss methods.
In another study, participants of 
both diet groups (diet and exercise 
group and diet-only group) showed a 
significantly greater reduction of the in-
flammatory marker interleukin-6 when 
compared with the exercise group, sug-
gesting less inflammation and therefore 
less osteoarthritis progression in the 
dietary groups (29). Moreover, in the 
same study, both dietary groups showed 
lower compressive forces when com-
pared with those in the exercise group; 
this comparison reached the level of sig-
nificance in the diet group and showed 
a statistical trend in the diet and exer-
cise group (29). A similar effect may 
have been introduced by the fact that
