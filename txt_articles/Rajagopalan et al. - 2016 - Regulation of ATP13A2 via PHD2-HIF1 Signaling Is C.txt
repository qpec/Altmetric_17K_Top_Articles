We previously reported that pharmacological inhibition of a class of enzymes known as prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins (PHDs) has
neuroprotectiveeffectsinvariousinvitroandinvivomodelsofParkinson’sdisease(PD).Wehypothesizedthatthiswasduetoinhibition
of the PHD2 isoform, preventing it from hydroxylating the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor 1 � (HIF1�), targeting it for
eventual proteasomal degradation. HIF1� itself induces the transcription of various cellular stress genes, including several involved in
iron metabolism. Although all three isoforms of PHD are expressed within vulnerable dopaminergic (DAergic) substantia nigra pars
compacta neurons, only select downregulation of the PHD2 isoform was found to protect against in vivo neurodegenerative effects
associated with the mitochondrial neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. These findings were corroborated in in-
duced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons, providing validation in a pertinent human cell model. PHD2 inhibition was found to result
in increased expression of ATP13A2, mutation of which is responsible for a rare juvenile form of PD known as Kufor-Rakeb syndrome.
Knockdown of ATP13A2 expression within human DAergic cells was found to abrogate restoration of cellular iron homeostasis and

These data suggest that regulation of ATP13A2 by the PHD2-HIF1� signaling pathway affects cellular iron homeostasis and DAergic
neuronal survival. This constitutes a heretofore unrecognized process associated with loss of ATP13A2 function that could have wide-
ranging implications for it as a therapeutic target for PD and other related conditions.

Introduction
We previously demonstrated that broad pharmacological inhibi-
tion of prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins (PHDs) results in
neuroprotective effects within vulnerable dopaminergic (DAer-
gic) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) in
several in vitro and in vivo models of Parkinson’s disease (PD; Lee
et al., 2009; Rajagopalan et al., 2014). This was found to coincide
with upregulation of the master transcriptional regulator, hyp-
oxia inducible factor 1 � (HIF1�; Lee et al., 2009; Rajagopalan et
al., 2014). HIF1� is hydroxylated at conserved proline residues by
these enzymes, resulting in its ubiquitination by the von Hippel
Lindau E3 ubiquitin ligase and subsequent degradation by the

Significance Statement
Reductions in PHD2 activity within dopaminergic neurons in vivo and in cultured human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived
neurons protects against mitochondrial stress-induced neurotoxicity. Protective effects are dependent on downstream HIF-1�
expression.KnockdownofATP13A2,agenelinkedtoararejuvenileformofParkinson’sdiseaseandrecentlyidentifiedasanovel
HIF1� target, was found to abrogate maintenance of cellular iron homeostasis and neuronal viability elicited by PHD2 inhibition
in vivo and in cultured dopaminergic cells under conditions of mitochondrial stress. Mechanistically, this was due to ATP13A2’s
role in maintaining lysosomal iron stores. This constitutes a novel mechanism by which alterations in ATP13A2 activity may be
driving PD-related neuropathology.

 proteasome (Bruick and McKnight, 2001; Harten et al., 2010;
Miyata et al., 2011). Steady-state levels of HIF1� have been hy-
pothesized to be preferentially limited by activity of the PHD2
isoform. PHD2 levels have been reported to be aberrantly ele-
vated within affected DAergic neurons in postmortem SNpc tis-
sues isolated from PD patients versus age-matched controls in
conjunction with reductions in HIF1� levels (Elstner et al., 2011).
HIF1� is itself part of a highly conserved complex that serves to
coordinate expression of a number of neuroprotective genes in-
volved in cellular stress responses, including several that aid in the
control of iron homeostasis (Siddiq et al., 2005; Nakayama, 2009;
Greer et al., 2012). Iron chelation has been shown in various PD
models by several laboratories, including our own, to protect
against increases in unsequestered iron within the nigrostriata, in
conjunction with reduced neurodegeneration (Kaur et al., 2003;
Mandel et al., 2004; Youdim et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2009). Based
on the known role of the PHD2-HIF1� signaling pathway in the
control of cellular iron levels, this suggests that the neuroprotec-
tive effects of PHD inhibition may be in part due to downstream
effects on iron homeostasis.
Lysosomes are principle reservoirs of redox-reactive ferrous
iron, defined as iron either in a “free” state or loosely bound to
anion molecules, such as citrate (Kurz et al., 2006, 2008;
Uchiyama et al., 2008; Terman and Kurz, 2013). Increases in
lysosomal pH results in release of lysosomal iron into the cytosol,
where it has been reported to contribute to subsequent cell death
(Uchiyama et al., 2008). Lysosomal pH has recently been re-
ported to be compromised in conjunction with mutations in a
gene called ATP13A2 associated with PD and other closely related
disorders, including a rare juvenile-onset form of PD known as
Kufer-Rakeb syndrome (Park et al., 2011; Dehay et al., 2012;
Podhajska et al., 2012). ATP13A2 is highly expressed within
DAergic SNpc neurons and this expression is decreased in both
postmortem PD tissues and in the brains of patients with Lewy
body disorder (Murphy et al., 2013). The protein itself is a
proton-pumping lysosomal ATPase and is suggested to play an
important role in the autophagic lysosomal pathway (ALP), al-
though its exact mechanistic role is still not completely under-
stood. It has been suggested that losses in ALP dysfunction drives
PD-associated neurodegeneration primarily via abnormal in-
creases in levels of the protein �-synuclein. However, recent data
in ATP13A2-deficent mice suggests that other independent neu-
ropathological events may also be involved (Tsunemi et al., 2014;
Kett et al., 2015).
Autosomal recessive mutations in ATP13A2 have been re-
ported to coincide with increased levels of iron in the basal gan-
glia in conjunction with increased neuronal cell loss (Gru
¨newald
et al., 2012; Gusdon et al., 2012; Levi and Finazzi, 2014). The
ATP13A2 promoter has recently been shown to contain a hypoxia
response element (HRE), to which the HIF1� protein binds, re-
sulting in increased ATP13A2 gene expression in cultured dopa-
minergic cells (Xu et al., 2012). PHD2 inhibition via subsequent
increases in steady-state HIF1� protein levels would be predicted
to increase ATP13A2 expression, which may in turn have positive
effects on cellular iron homeostasis. Reducing ATP13A2 in this
context could conversely cause disruptions in cellular iron ho-
meostasis, resulting in increased susceptibility to neuronal cell
loss. Here we report that not only is expression of ATP13A2 reg-
ulated by the PHD2-HIF1� signaling pathway, but that this is
instrumental in the control of cellular iron homeostasis and
DAergic neuronal survival, likely via maintenance of lysosomal
iron storage. This has important implications for the potential
mechanisms by which alterations in lysosomal ATP13A2 activity
drives PD-related neuropathology and for future clinical appli-
cations toward enhancing ATP13A2 function.
Materials and Methods
Creation of DAergic PHD isoform-specific knockdown mouse models.
Mice in which PHD-specific isoforms are selectively knocked down
within DAergic neurons were created by crossing floxed isoform-
specific PHD lines provided to us by Professor Guo-Hua Fong (Uni-
versity of Connecticut; Takeda et al., 2008) with commercially
available lines in which Cre recombinase is driven by the tyrosine
hydroxylase (TH) promoter [B6.cg.-tg(Th-cre)1tmd/j 008601, Jack-
son Laboratory] to create pTH-CRE-floxed PHD lines. Floxed-only
littermates were used as negative controls. All subsequent experi-
ments were performed in 3–4-month-old mice of mixed gender un-
less otherwise noted. Studies were performed in adherence with the
National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals.
PCR validation of select PHD isoform-specific deletions. DNA was iso-
lated from olfactory bulb (OB) and cerebellum (CB) tissues taken from
heterozygous pTH-CRE-floxed PHD knockdowns versus analogous
floxed-only controls using Extract-N-Amp Tissue PCR Kit (Sigma-
Aldrich). The presence of the expected deletion for each PHD isoform
was verified via PCR using specific primers. For PHD1, deletion of exon
3 was detected using the following primer: forward, GGAGCTGG
AGTTCTAGGTCAGGTT;
reverse,
GGAGCTGGAGTTCTAGGTCA
GGTT. This gave rise to a �1100 bp amplicon for the floxed allele and a
�480 bp amplicon for the deleted allele. For PHD2, deletion of exon 2
was detected using the following primer: forward, CACTGACATGA
CATGGGAGGGGA; reverse, CCCGAAGAACGATACCGTCGAG. This
gave rise to a �950 bp amplicon for the floxed allele and a �250 bp
amplicon for the deleted allele. For PHD3, deletion of exon 2 was de-
tected using the following primer: forward, CTCAGACCCCCTAAG
TATGT; reverse, CCACGTTAACTCTAGAGCCACTGA. This gave rise
to a �1228 bp amplicon for the floxed allele and a �1000 bp amplicon
for the deleted allele.
Fluorescent immunocytochemistry. For in vivo immunocytochemistry
(ICC) analyses, mice were perfused with phosphate-buffered saline
followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were sectioned at 40 �m
with a cryostat and sections were incubated in primary anti-TH anti-
body (Millipore Bioscience Research Reagents) and in anti-PHD
(Novus Biologicals) for 24 h, 4°C. Sections were then incubated with
fluorescent goat anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa fluorophores (Life Technolo-
gies). Fluorescence intensity was analyzed using a Zeiss LSM 780. For
in vitro ICC analyses, primary mesencephalic cultures were isolated as
previously described (Kaur et al., 2003). After 4 d of in vitro culture,
cells were exposed to the PHD2 inhibitor IOX2 (50 nM) in the absence
or presence of the HIF1� inhibitor 2-methoxyestradiol (100 nM) for
4 h followed by 5 �M 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridium ion (MPP �) for
24 h. Cultures were immunostained with anti-TH antibody and Alexa
Fluor 488 secondary antibody. Total numbers of TH-positive neurons
were counted in 3–5 separate wells for each condition.
Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis of SH-SY5Y and mouse
striatal tissues were performed as previously described (Lee et al., 2009),
using antibodies for PHD1 (Novus Biologicals), PHD2 (Cell Signaling
Technology), PHD3 (Novus Biologicals), ATP13A2 (Sigma-Aldrich),
HO-1 (Stressgen), and actin (Millipore).
Stereological TH� cell counts following systemic in vivo 1-methyl-
4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine administration. One-methyl-4-
phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) was given at a dosage of 20 �
2 mg/kg, 12 h apart, to elicit a �30% SN DAergic cell loss in control
animals (Lee et al., 2009). Midbrain sections (40 �m) were incubated
with polyclonal anti-TH antibody (1:1000; Millipore Bioscience Re-
search Reagents) overnight at 4°C, followed by biotin-labeled secondary
antibody and development using DAB (Vector Laboratories). Unbiased
stereological cell counts were performed using the optical fractionator
method as previously described (Lee et al., 2009).
Rearing behavior. To evaluate spontaneous motor initiation, ani-
mals were placed individually in a cylinder to determine the number
of rearing events over 45 s as described in previous reports (Willard et
Rajagopalan et al. • Regulation of ATP13A2 via PHD2-HIF1� Signaling
J. Neurosci., January 27, 2016 • 36(4):1086–1095 • 1087
 al., 2015). Each rearing session was video re-
corded. The average number of rears over
two trials was taken. After testing, animals
were returned back to group housing.
Measurements of cytosolic ferrous iron levels
via calcein dequenching. For quantitation of cy-
tosolic ferrous iron levels in samples isolated
from in vivo MPTP-treated versus saline-
treated PHD2 knockdown and control mice,
dopaminergic synaptosomes were prepared as
previously described (Chinta et al., 2007; Choi
et al., 2011). Isolated synaptosomes were resus-
pended in HEPES-buffered Krebs-like (HBK)
buffer (Daniel et al., 2012) and plated onto
clear bottom black plates (BD Biosciences)
coated with 0.0033% (v/v) polyethyleneimine
solution at a concentration of 5 �g protein in
100 �l HBK buffer. Synaptosomes were subse-
quently attached to plates by centrifugation at
1500 � g for 30 min, followed by incubation at
37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 45 min. Sub-
sets of synatosomal aliquots were pretreated
with bafilomycin (100 nM) for 15 min before
performing measurements of cytosolic iron
levels via the calcein dequenching method in
the presence of the ferrous iron chelator salicy-
laldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone (SIH; gift of
Katherine Franz), as previously described
(Kaur et al., 2009). Dilution of calcein, SIH,
and washes were all performed in HBK buffer.
Values reported indicate the fraction of iron-
bound calcein obtained by the ratio of the dif-
ference in total fluorescence after SIH was
added to total fluorescence before SIH was
added.
Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived DAergic
neurons and treatments. Human induced pluri-
potent stem cell (iPSC)-derived DAergic neu-
rons were purchased from XCell Science. Cells
were pretreated with IOX2 (2 �M) for 3 h be-
fore treatment in 1 mM MPP � for an addi-
tional 24 h. Mitochondrial function was
assessed by measurement of mitochondrial
membrane potential via fluorescent tetrameth-
ylrhodamine methyl ester assay and cell
viability via 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-
diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay.
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR. A pure RNA
tissue kit (Roche) was used to isolate RNA
from mesencephalic cultures or from OB and
ST tissues. Gene expression was determined via
qPCR using SYBR Green master mix (Roche).
The primer sets used were as follows: ATP13A2

Generation and analysis of differentiated human SY5Y cells stably ex-
pressing human ATP13A2 shRNA. Human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells
(ATCC) were grown to confluence in provided SHSY5Y media followed
by subculture for 6 d in 10 �M retinoic acid followed by 3 d in 80 nM
12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate to allow their full differentiation
into mature dopaminergic neurons (Presgraves et al., 2004). These cells
were previously stably transfected with human ATP13A2 shRNA lentivi-
rus from Sigma-Aldrich (TRCN0000050405) versus a scrambled shRNA
control. RT-PCR was performed using human ATP13A2 primers
(NM_001141973) and results normalized to the housekeeping gene ac-
tin. Reductions in ATP13A2 protein levels were verified by Western blot-
ting. Following differentiation, cells were plated at a density of 15,000
cells per well in 96-well plates and treated with �2.5 mM MPP � and �1
�M IOX2 for 24 h; a subset of cells was pretreated for 2 h with 100 nM

Results
PHD2-HIF1� signaling affects DAergic cell viability
All three isoforms of PHD are expressed within DAergic as well as
other cell types within the SN (Fig. 1A). To investigate whether
effects of pharmacological PHD inhibition on DAergic neurons
are isoform-specific and cell-autonomous, we generated mouse
lines in which each PHD isoform was selectively knocked down
specifically within DAergic neurons, including those of the SN.
For these studies, individual floxed isoform-specific PHD lines
were crossed with transgenics expressing Cre recombinase be-
hind the TH promoter to create lines in which levels of each of the
three PHD isoforms was individually knocked down versus
floxed-only control littermates. Dopamine-select, PHD isoform-
specific deletion was initially verified by PCR using DNA isolated
from the OB, a tissue rich in DAergic neurons, versus the CB as
negative control (Fig. 1B). PHD-isoform deletion was verified to
occur only within the OB of Cre-floxed PHD knockdowns and
not in the CB nor in either tissue in floxed-only controls. As
expected due to the presence of both DAergic and non-DAergic
cells within the OB, we observed the presence of both deleted and
full-length gene products in our analysis. PHD isoform-specific
protein knockdown was subsequently confirmed in nigrostriatal
tissues from heterozygous pTH-CRE floxed PHD mice via West-
ern blot analysis (Fig. 1C).
We next assessed the effects of PHD knockdown following
systemic administration of the mitochondrial neurotoxin MPTP
using the same low-dose administration regime previously used
in our pharmacological PHD inhibitor studies for comparison
(Lee et al., 2009). Genetic knockdown of PHD2 within DAergic
neurons was found to significantly attenuate the loss of these
neurons within the SN, to a degree similar to that observed using
broad-acting PHD inhibitors or iron che-
lation (Fig. 2A; Kaur et al., 2003; Lee et al.,
2009). In contrast, genetic reductions in
DAergic levels of either the PHD1 or
PHD3 isoform had no significant effect on
restoration of cell viability (Fig. 2A).
Knockdown of PHD2 was additionally
shown to abrogate losses in motor func-
tion as assessed by rearing behavior, a
measure that has been demonstrated to be
more sensitive to dopamine loss than
other motor tests, including the open field
test and the pole test (Willard et al., 2015;
Fig. 2B).
Primary mesencephalic cultures iso-
lated from PHD2 knockdown animals,
verified to display reductions in PHD2
protein levels selectively within dopami-
nergic SN neurons (Fig. 2C), also dis-
played similar neuroprotective effects in
the presence of the MPTP metabolite
MPP �
(Fig.
2D,E).
Pharmacological
PHD2 inhibition using the select inhibitor
IOX2 was found to attenuate both reduc-
tions in mitochondrial function and neu-
ronal cell loss in human iPSC-derived DAergic neurons treated
with MPP � (Fig. 2F,G), demonstrating that what we observe in
the mice translates into analogous effects in a relevant nontrans-
formed human cell model. Neuroprotective effects in mesen-
cephalic cultures were found to be dependent on HIF1� activity
(Fig. 2H,I).
The PHD2-HIF1� signaling pathway regulates expression
of ATP13A2
Pharmacological PHD2 inhibition by IOX2 was found to result in
increased expression of several HIF1� target genes in isolated
mesencephalic cultures from floxed PHD2 control lines (data not
shown), including that encoding the lysosomal ATPase ATP13A2
(Fig. 3A). Upregulation of ATP13A2 mRNA levels was also found
to occur in both OB and ST tissues isolated from DAergic PHD2
knockdown mice versus floxed-only controls (Fig. 3B,C). This
coincided with increased nigrostriatal levels of ATP13A2 protein
in PHD2 knockdowns versus floxed-only controls (Fig. 3D). In
contrast, no alterations in ATP13A2 levels were observed in ei-
ther PHD1-specific or PHD3-specific knockdown lines (Fig. 3E).
These data suggest that the PHD2-HIF1� pathway selectively acts
to regulate levels of ATP13A2 within DAergic neurons.
Regulation of ATP13A2 acts to maintain lysosomal iron
stores under conditions of PD-related stress
Lysosomal pH has been found to be compromised in ATP13A2-
deficient fibroblasts and DAergic cell lines, which can in turn
result in disruptions in lysosomal iron storage (Dehay et al., 2012;
Uchiyama et al., 2008). To explore the potential impact of re-
duced PHD2 on levels of lysosomal iron storage, we interrogated
levels of cytosol ferrous iron in striatal dopaminergic synapto-
somes isolated from PHD2 knockdown versus control mice, pre-
pared via a magnetic bead column purification protocol
previously described by our laboratory (Chinta et al., 2007; Choi
et al., 2011). Levels of cytosolic iron were assessed using the cal-
cein quenching assay in the absence and presence of the select
ferrous iron chelator SIH (Tenopoulou et al., 2007; Kon et al.,
2010). Ferrous cytosolic iron levels were found to be significantly

dox reactions (Fig. 4A). After addition of
the lysosomal ATPase inhibitor bafilomy-
cin to induce release of lysosomal iron
stores, cytosolic ferrous iron levels were
not altered under basal conditions (data
not shown). However, they were found to
be significantly elevated in striatal dopa-
minergic synaptosomes from MPTP-
treated PHD2 knockdowns versus MPTP-
treated control mice (Fig. 4B). This
suggests that in the context of PD-related
stress, lysosomal iron storage is higher in
the PHD2 knockdowns versus controls,
possibly in part due to elevations in
ATP13A2 levels in these animals.
To validate a causative role for
ATP13A2 in maintenance of lysosomal
iron storage under conditions of PD-
related stress, we interrogated the impact
of its knockdown in differentiated human
DAergic SY5Y cells. We found that stable
lentiviral shRNA-mediated knockdown
of ATP13A2 (Fig. 5A–C) resulted in eleva-
tions in cytosolic ferrous iron levels both
basally and following MPTP treatment
(Fig. 5D). Following administration of ba-
filomycin, while cytosolic ferrous iron lev-
els within MPTP-treated control cells
further increased, there were no addi-
tional increases within the MPTP-treated
Figure 5.

Rajagopalan et al. • Regulation of ATP13A2 via PHD2-HIF1� Signaling
 ATP13A2 knockdown cells. This suggests that, particularly under
conditions of stress, maintenance of lysosomal iron storage is
dependent in part on ATP13A2.
As previously demonstrated in the context of PHD2 knock-
down in vivo (Fig. 3), select inhibition of PHD2 by IOX2
was found to result in upregulation of ATP13A2 expression,
which was attenuated in the presence of ATP13A2 shRNA (Fig.
5E). At the concentrations used in this set of experiments, IOX2
on its own did not reduce cytosolic iron levels. However, it did
abrogate MPP �-mediated increases and these effects were re-
versed in the presence of ATP13A2 shNA (Fig. 5F). While
ATP13A2 knockdown alone did not have a significant impact on
cell viability, it was found to abrogate IOX2-mediated neuropro-
tection against PD-related stress in these cells (Fig. 5G). Further-
more, ATP13A2 knockdown was found to partially abrogate
neuroprotection elicited by IOX2 on MPP �-mediated neurotox-
icity. This suggests that neuroprotection elicited by reductions in
PHD2 levels can be abrogated by ATP13A2 knockdown and is
therefore partially ATP13A2-dependent.
Discussion
HIF1� is part of a highly conserved complex that controls re-
sponse to various cellular stressors via its ability to bind to HREs
located within the promoters of HIF1� target genes, upregulating
their expression. HIF1� can be inactivated via its hydroxylation
by PHDs, resulting in its subsequent ubiquitination and degra-
dation by the proteasome (Bruick and McKnight, 2001; Harten et
al., 2010; Miyata et al., 2011). HIF1� knockdown in murine
midbrain-derived neural precursor cells and in DAergic SN neu-
rons in vivo has been reported to result in neuronal cell loss,
suggesting that maintenance of HIF1� levels is important for
survival of these cells (Milosevic et al., 2007). A better under-
standing the mechanistic role of the HIF1� signaling pathway in
DAergic cell survival could provide us with important clues as to
how its dysregulation promotes DAergic cell loss and may be
prevented via its activation (Milosevic et al., 2007). Results from
this current study support the notion that HIF1� signaling is an
important pathway in the control of DAergic SNpc cell viability
and therefore constitutes a credible therapeutic target for PD and
other related disorders (Milosevic et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2009;
Rajagopalan et al., 2014).
Our laboratory previously reported that broad-acting phar-
macological PHD inhibition in vivo prevented increased nigral
iron levels, mitochondrial dysfunction, and select nigrostriatal
neurodegeneration associated with sys-
temic MPTP administration in conjunc-
tion with enhanced HIF1� activation (Lee
et al., 2009). In a separate study, we
showed that pharmacological PHD inhib-
itors were also neuroprotective in an age-
related genetic mouse model in which
dopaminergic
glutathione
levels
are
downregulated, emulating biochemical
changes reported to occur in the PD brain,
including mitochondrial defects and se-
lective age-related loss of DAergic SN
neurons (Rajagopalan et al., 2014). How-
ever, the particular isoform(s) involved
were not determined in these previous
studies. Here we report that although all
three PHD isoforms are expressed within
DAergic neurons as well as other cell types
in the SNpc, neuroprotective effects in the
face of mitochondrial stress elicited by
MPTP or its derivative MPP � were found to be PHD2-specific
and HIF1�-dependent. In addition to our own findings in the
context of both differentiated human SY5Y cells and iPSC-
derived neurons, relevance of these findings to the human disease
state are further bolstered by previous postmortem data demon-
strating the aberrant elevation of PHD2 levels and lowered
HIF1� levels in affected DAergic neurons isolated from the pa-
tient SNpc tissues versus those from age-matched controls (Elst-
ner et al., 2011). This suggests that the PHD2 isoform may be a
select target for intervention in PD via its ability to regulate
HIF1� protein levels in affected DAergic neurons.
HIF1� coordinates expression of a number of downstream
neuroprotective genes, including several that aid in the preserva-
tion of cellular iron homeostasis under conditions of stress (Sid-
diq et al., 2005; Nakayama, 2009; Greer et al., 2012). In addition
to PHD inhibition, iron chelation has also been demonstrated to
protect against increases in unsequestered iron within the nigros-
triata in association with various PD models including MPTP
administration, in conjunction with reductions in accompanying
neurodegeneration (Kaur et al., 2003; Mandel et al., 2004; You-
dim et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2009). Several ongoing drug develop-
ment studies, including in our own laboratory (data not shown),
seek to identify novel iron-chelating agents for the treatment of
PD. An important role of PHD2-HIF1� signaling may be its abil-
ity to regulate cellular iron metabolism and this pathway may
therefore constitute an alternative target toward this same clinical
aim.
The ATP13A2 gene has recently been reported to be a tran-
scriptional target of HIF1� in cultured DAergic cell lines (Xu
et al., 2012). The gene itself encodes a lysosomal ATPase that is
highly expressed within DAergic SNpc neurons and reduced in
postmortem SNpc tissues isolated from patients with PD and
other related conditions (Murphy et al., 2013). The physiolog-
ical function of ATP13A2, and hence the role of its dysfunc-
tion in PD, is still somewhat elusive. PD-linked mutations in
ATP13A2 have been demonstrated to lead to alterations in
ALP function, including decreased proteolytic processing of
lysosomal enzymes, reduced degradation of lysosomal sub-
strates, and diminished lysosomal-mediated clearance of au-
tophagosomes in various cellular models in conjunction with
increased DAergic cell death (Dehay et al., 2012). Conversely,
restoration of ATP13A2 levels in ATP13A2 mutant or depleted
cells restores lysosomal function and attenuates cell death.

 These data suggest that modulation of ATP13A2 levels may
have therapeutic potential in the context of PD, although the
precise mechanisms involved are unclear.
Lysosomal pH has been reported to be compromised in
ATP13A2 mutant fibroblasts and in DAergic cell lines in which
levels have been genetically reduced (Dehay et al., 2012). Based
on studies in other cell types, this would result in disruption of
lysosomal iron storage (Uchiyama et al., 2008). Levels of iron in
the basal ganglia have been reported to be elevated in the context
of mutations in ATP13A2 (Gru
¨newald et al., 2012; Gusdon et al.,
2012; Levi and Finazzi, 2014). While several previous publica-
tions have implicated a role for ATP13A2 in zinc homeostasis, its
ability to affect cellular iron levels is unclear (Kong et al., 2014;
Park et al., 2014; Tsunemi and Krainc, 2014; Rinaldi et al., 2015).
Based on our results, one important consequence of inhibition of
PHD2 may be the elevation of ATP13A2 expression, resulting in
the preservation of cellular iron homeostasis in the face of mito-
chondrial stress. Mechanistically, this appears to involve the
maintenance of lysosomal iron storage. Reductions in its levels
reverse these effects, resulting in increased cytosolic iron levels
and susceptibility to neuronal cell loss.
PHD2 knockdown may affect other potential HIF1� targets
involved in the maintenance of cellular iron homeostasis, includ-
ing transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and the divalent metal trans-
porter (DMT1). Indeed, levels of TfR1 protein were found to be
elevated while levels of DMT1 were reduced in striatal tissues
from PHD2 knockdowns versus controls (Fig. 6). TfR1 elevations
would be predicted to result in increased endocytosis of the TfR1-
Tf-Fe 3� complex into the lysosome, which in the presence of low
lysosomal pH would result in release of iron from the complex in
the form of ferrous iron (Kurz et al., 2011). The HIF-responsive
form of DMT1 present in dopaminergic cells is located on the
lysosomal membrane, where it is believed to function in the ex-
port of ferrous iron from this organelle (Lis et al., 2005). In addi-
tion to presence of an HRE, lysosomal DMT1 also contains an
iron response element (IRE) present in the isoform found to be
upregulated following MPTP exposure in vivo and in affected
human Parkinsonian SN tissues (Garrick et al., 2006; Salazar et
al., 2008). This could explain why DMT1 protein levels are
reduced in the face of PHD2 inhibition (i.e., an increase in
HIF1� levels would initially result in increased DMT1 tran-
scription), but in the face of high cellular iron levels associated
with both PD and in PD models, presence of the IRE would
drive increased degradation of the mRNA and subsequent re-
ductions DMT1 protein levels. The net effect of lowered lyso-
somal DMT1 would be the same as that for elevations in TfR1
to retain ferrous iron within the lysosome. This may in part
explain the elevated levels of lysosomal storage in the PHD2
knockdown animals. However, disruption of ATP13A2 results
in reduced ability to maintain lysosomal iron stores, particu-
larly under conditions of stress.
Taken in total, our data suggests that not only is expression of
ATP13A2 regulated by the PHD2-HIF1� signaling pathway, but
that this is instrumental in maintaining cellular iron homeostasis
and cell viability in mitochondrially compromised DAergic neu-
rons. This constitutes a novel function for ATP13A2 that could
have important implications for mechanisms underlying the loss
of cellular iron homeostasis associated with PD neuropathology.
Based on these findings, further preclinical and clinical studies
are strongly warranted to explore whether enhancement of
ATP13A2 function constitutes a tractable therapeutic target for
the clinical treatment of PD.
