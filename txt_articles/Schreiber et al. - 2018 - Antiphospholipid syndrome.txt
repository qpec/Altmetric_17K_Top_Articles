 Almost 35 years after the original description of anti­
phospholipid syndrome (APS), our understanding of 
this disorder is still evolving. Although APS was  
initially 
described as an acquired, autoimmune thrombo­
philia, we know today that mechanisms other than 
coagulation­ 
mediated thrombosis contribute to some 
clinical manifesta 
tions; for instance, complement activ­
ation might mediate placental injury, which can cause 
fetal loss1. APS is an autoimmune disease associated with 
the presence of autoanti 
bodies. These auto 
anti 
bodies 
include anticardiolipin antibodies, anti­β2­ 
glyco 
protein 1 
antibodies and lupus anti 
coagulant. Anti 
cardio­
lipin antibodies are directed against cardiolipin, which 
is a phospholipid contained in cell membranes. Anti­
β2­glycoprotein 1 antibodies are directed against β2­ 
glycoprotein 1 — a cardiolipin­binding factor. Lastly, 
lupus anticoagulant is a mixture of various auto 
anti­
bodies, which are detected by the prolongation of 
 
phospholipid­dependent  
coagulation tests. 
The diagnosis of APS is based on the combination of 
clinical features (for example, thrombosis in the arteries, 
veins and/or small vessels or obstetrical complications 
such as recurrent miscarriage and placental insufficiency) 
and the detection of circulating antiphos 
pholipid antibod­
ies. The classification criteria presented in BOX 1 are often 
used as diagnostic tools2. However, other features such as 
thrombocytopenia and cardiac valve lesions also occur 
within the spectrum of APS.
The management of APS has been subject to contro­
versy in recent years. Anticoagulation therapy is consid­
ered the cornerstone of therapy; however, the optimal 
agents and the intensity of treatment remain a matter of 
debate3. The final treatment decision is dependent on the 
clinical manifestations, the antiphospholipid antibody 
profile and the concurrent cardiovascular risk factors. 
In fact, despite the dearth of studies focused on the influ­
ence of treating hypertension, dyslipidaemia and diabetes 
mellitus as well as cessation of tobacco smoking in those 
with APS, such measures are considered by experts to be 
vital to reduce the risk of future thrombosis3.
As APS is a fairly new and rare disease, good­ 
quality 
data to guide treatment are scarce; treatment decisions 
have relied on expert opinion in many cases. This Primer 
provides an update on the pathogenesis, diagnosis and 
therapeutic aspects of APS from an academic and practi­
cal point of view and offers an outlook on future research 
topics, with the acknowledgement that many established 
concepts of today may change in ensuing years.
Epidemiology
Antiphospholipid antibodies are not specific to APS but 
can be detected in different clinical settings, including

Abstract | Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the 
presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, such as lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies 
and anti‑β2‑glycoprotein 1 antibodies. APS can present with a variety of clinical phenotypes, 
including thrombosis in the veins, arteries and microvasculature as well as obstetrical complications. 
The pathophysiological hallmark is thrombosis, but other factors such as complement activation might 
be important. Prevention of thrombotic manifestations associated with APS includes lifestyle changes 
and, in individuals at high risk, low‑dose aspirin. Prevention and treatment of thrombotic events are 
dependent mainly on the use of vitamin K antagonists. Immunosuppression and anticomplement 
therapy have been used anecdotally but have not been adequately tested. Pregnancy morbidity 
includes unexplained recurrent early miscarriage, fetal death and late obstetrical manifestation such 
as pre‑eclampsia, premature birth or fetal growth restriction associated with placental insufficiency. 
Current treatment to prevent obstetrical morbidity is based on low‑dose aspirin and/or low‑
molecular‑weight heparin and has improved pregnancy outcomes to achieve successful live birth 
in >70% of pregnancies. Although hydroxychloroquine and pravastatin might further improve 
pregnancy outcomes, prospective clinical trials are required to confirm these findings.

 in healthy individuals, in individuals with a history of 
thrombosis and/or pregnancy morbidity and in individ­
uals with other autoimmune conditions (including 
 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)) (TABLE 1).
General population
The overall prevalence of antiphospholipid anti 
bodies 
and APS in the general population remains to be deter­
mined, as no robust epidemiological population­based 
studies have been performed4. Moreover, despite con­
siderable efforts over the past three decades geared 
towards the standardization of immunoassays that 
measure antiphospholipid antibodies, profound inter­
assay and interlaboratory variation are still reported5. 
Consequently, the availability of solid epidemiological 
data on the prevalence of antiphospholipid antibody 
positivity and APS in the general population is limited.
Durcan and Petri estimated that the incidence of 
APS is ~5 new cases per 100,000 individuals per year 
and that the prevalence is ~40–50 cases per 100,000 
individuals6. The prevalence of catastrophic APS, a rare, 
life­ 
threatening form of APS, has been estimated to be 
<1% of all cases of APS7. Studies have estimated that the 
prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies in the general 
population ranges between 1% and 5%, but the antibody 
titre in most of these studies was low8. An increased 
preva 
lence of antiphospholipid antibodies has been 
reported with ageing, with the highest values reported 
in healthy centenarians but without an association with 
clinical manifestations of APS9.
Thrombosis
The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies is a risk 
factor for thrombosis; consequently, the prevalence of 
antiphospholipid antibodies is higher in individuals 
with thrombotic or cardiovascular events than in the 
general population. The APS ACTION group reported 
a literature review focused on the prevalence of anti­
phospholipid antibodies in the general population with 
pregnancy morbidity, stroke, myocardial infarction 
and deep vein thrombosis. The authors estimated that 
~13% of individuals with stroke, ~11% of individuals 
with myocardial infarction and ~9.5% of individuals with 
deep vein thrombosis are positive for antiphospholipid 
antibodies10. Another study in women <50 years of age 
who had had a stroke showed that 17% were positive for 
lupus anticoagulant compared with 0.7% in the control 
group (OR of 43.1)11. Positivity for lupus anticoagulant 
combined with oestrogen­containing oral contraceptive 
use or smoking increased the risk further (to an OR of 
201.0 and 87.0, respectively11.
Individuals who have had obstetrical complications 
associated with APS are also at increased risk of devel­
oping thrombosis. A case–control study showed that 
the 12­year cumulative thrombotic incidence rate was 
signifi 
cantly increased in women with APS and recurrent 
miscarriages (incidence of 19.3%, n = 57) compared with 
women with recurrent miscarriage of unknown aetiology 
(incidence of 4.8%, n = 86), women with recurrent mis­
carriage and thrombophilic genetic defects as the only 
aetiological factor for recurrent miscarriage (incidence 
of 0%, n = 42) and women who are antiphospholipid 
antibody­ 
positive but otherwise healthy (incidence of 0%, 
n = 30)12. These results are in line with a 10­year observa­
tional cohort study of 1,592 women, which showed that 
women who were positive for anti 
phospholipid antibod­
ies and who had experienced three consecutive spontane­
ous miscarriages at <10 weeks of gestation or one fetal 
death at ≥10 weeks of gestation had annual rates of deep 
vein thrombosis of 1.46% (range 1.15–1.82%), pulmonary 
embolism of 0.43% (range 0.26–0.66%), superficial vein 
thrombosis of 0.44% (range 0.28–0.68%) and cerebro­
vascular events of 0.32% (range 0.18–0.53%); these 
numbers were significantly higher than in women with 
mutations predisposing to thrombosis, such as factor V 
Leiden (rs6025) mutations and prothrombin 20210A 
(rs1799963) mutations, or in women who were negative 
for thrombophilia13. This finding was in contrast to a 
retro 
spective case–control study showing that the throm­
bosis rate in women with previous recurrent miscarriages 
associated with antiphospholipid antibodies is similar to 
the rate in those with idiopathic recurrent miscarriage14.
Pregnancy complications
The APS ACTION group showed that 6% of patients 
with relevant pregnancy morbidity were positive for 
antiphospholipid antibodies10. Recurrent miscarriage is 
the most frequent complication and is observed in the 
majority (~54%) of women with obstetrical APS included 
in the European Registry on Obstetric Antiphospholipid 
Syndrome15. Fetal death is considered to be the conse­
quence of placental dysfunction and is strongly associated 
with antiphospholipid antibodies16,17. In an analysis of 512 
stillbirths enrolled in the Stillbirth Collaborative Research 
Network from 2006 to 2008, 11% (95% CI 8.4–14.4) of the 
women were positive for antiphospholipid antibodies18.
Autoimmune diseases
Antiphospholipid antibodies can be detected in associ­
ation with other systemic autoimmune diseases, most 
frequently SLE (TABLE 1). The prevalence of antiphospho­
lipid antibodies among patients with SLE ranges from

 15% to 34% for lupus anticoagulant, from 12% to 44% 
for anticardiolipin and from 10% to 19% for anti­β2­ 
glycoprotein 1 antibodies6. Of individuals with SLE who 
are positive for antiphospholipid antibodies, 20–50% 
develop thrombotic events19.
Some reports have described considerable hetero­
geneity in the prevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) 
isotype anticardiolipin antibodies in SLE, ranging 
from 2% in individuals of Afro­Caribbean descent to 
51% in individ 
uals of Indian descent; the variation is 
partly explained by differences in the assays used20,21. 
When investigating the prevalence of antiphospholipid 
anti 
bodies in Chinese individuals with SLE, a preva­
lence of 22.4% was found for lupus anticoagulant, 29% 
for anti 
cardio 
lipin antibodies and 7.7% for anti­β2­ 
glycoprotein 1 antibodies; these numbers are lower than 
in white individuals with SLE22. However, the 10­year 
thrombosis rate and rate of recurrent thrombosis in 
Chinese individuals with antiphospholipid antibodies 
was similar to that reported in a European prospective 
cohort of 1,000 patients with APS22. Thus, the observa­
tion of lower antiphospholipid antibody levels in Chinese 
individuals might represent differences in the assays used.
Mechanisms/pathophysiology
Antiphospholipid antibody formation
Infectious agents are the main triggers for the forma­
tion of antiphospholipid antibodies, a process that 
is best understood for anti­β2­glycoprotein 1 anti­
bodies. Molecular mimicry between structures of bac­
teria or viruses and β2­glycoprotein­1­derived amino 
acid sequences are thought to contribute to the for­
mation of autoantibodies23. In addition, misfolding of 
β2­ 
glycoprotein 1 can also induce autoantibody forma­
tion24. Binding of β2­glycoprotein 1 to the surface protein 
H of Streptococcus pyogenes induces a conformational 
change in β2­glycoprotein 1, thereby exposing a cryptic 
epitope in domain 1 of β2­glycoprotein 1. Mice injected 
with the mouse protein H–β2­glycoprotein 1 complex 
developed antibodies against this epitope25. Healthy 
individuals seem to have the potential to produce anti­
bodies against β2­glycoprotein 1; however, only with the 
appropriate genetic background or following secondary 
triggers do these antibodies become pathogenetic.
Two-hit model
Although antiphospholipid antibodies are persistently 
present, thrombotic events occur only occasionally, 
suggesting that the development of antiphospholipid 
antibodies is a necessary but insufficient step in the 
development of APS and that other factors play a part. 
Such ‘second hits’ or ‘triggers’ probably push the haemo­
static balance in favour of thrombosis and might include 
environmental factors (such as infection), inflammatory 
factors (such as concomitant connective tissue diseases) 
or other nonimmunological procoagulant factors (such 
as oestrogen­containing contraceptives, surgery and 
immobility)26. The patient’s genetic constitution, in rela­
tion to genes encoding inflammatory mediators, might 
also be a critical variable in the development of clinical 
APS manifestations. Familial studies suggest a genetic 
predisposition to APS, in part accounted for by the 
human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system, with the most 
consistent associations being those with HLA‑DR4 and 
HLA‑DRw53 (REFS 27–29). Furthermore, the presence of 
both lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibod­
ies seems to be associated with these HLA genotypes30. 
Other genes outside the HLA system might also predis­
pose to the development of APS, including IRF5 (encod­
ing interferon regulatory factor 5) and STAT4 (encoding 
signal transducer and activator of transcription 4)30.
Thrombosis
A striking observation is that patients with antiphospho­
lipid antibodies can experience thrombotic complications 
in every blood vessel, although deep vein thrombosis 
(usually in the legs) and ischaemic stroke account for 
90% of all complications31. The risk factors for throm­
botic complications associated with arterial thrombosis 
are different from those for venous thromboembolism 
(including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embo­
lism)32, suggesting that the interference of antiphospho­
lipid antibodies with homeostasis in each blood vessel 
type is unique. Alternatively, it is also possible that the 
autoantibodies interfere with metabolic pathways, which 
are differently involved in venous, arterial and micro­
vascular thrombosis. Several mechanisms to explain the 
prothrombotic effects of antiphospholipid antibodies 
have been proposed, although none of these suggestions 
has been proven33 (FIG. 1).

istration of antiphospholipid antibodies to mice, rats 
or hamsters does not result in spontaneous thrombotic 
Box 1 | The classification criteria for definite APS
The revised classification criteria for antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) are referred 
to as the Miyakis criteria2. A patient has to fulfil at least one clinical criteria and at least 
one laboratory criteria.
Clinical criteria
Vascular thrombosis
≥1 clinical episode of arterial, venous or small-vessel thrombosis. Thrombosis must 
be objectively confirmed. If histopathological confirmation is used, thrombosis must be 
present without inflammation of the vessel wall.
Pregnancy morbidity
• ≥1 unexplained death of a morphologically normal fetus ≥10 weeks of gestation
• ≥1 premature delivery of a morphologically normal fetus <34 weeks gestation because 
of severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia (defined according to standard definitions) 
or recognized features of placental insufficiency
• ≥3 unexplained consecutive miscarriages at <10 weeks of gestation, with maternal and 
paternal factors (such as anatomical, hormonal or chromosomal abnormalities) excluded
Laboratory criteria
The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies on ≥2 occasions at least 12 weeks apart 
and <5 years before clinical manifestations, as demonstrated by ≥1 of the following:
• Presence of lupus anticoagulant in plasma
• Medium titre to high titre of anticardiolipin antibodies (>40 GPL* or MPL*, 
or >99th percentile‡) of immunoglobulin G (IgG) or IgM isotypes
• Anti-β2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies of IgG or IgM isotypes present in plasma
*GPL and MPL are arbitrary units; 1 GPL or MPL refers to 1 μg of IgG or IgM antibody, 
respectively. ‡Exact value depends on the assay.

 complications. However, in keeping with a ‘multihit’ 
hypothesis of thrombosis, the thrombotic response 
after a priming event, such as a minor vascular injury, 
is much stronger in the presence of antiphospholipid 
antibodies than after infusion of a control antibody34–36. 
This observation in animal models fits with the find­
ing that antiphospholipid antibodies are risk factors 
for thrombosis in humans. Indeed, individuals with 
antiphospholipid antibodies will respond more pro­
foundly to thrombotic challenges than those without 
antiphospholipid antibodies.
Animal models have clearly shown that antibod­
ies against β2­glycoprotein 1, especially those against 
domain 1, can induce a strong prothrombotic pheno­
type37,38. The epitopes to which the antibodies against 
β2­glycoprotein 1 are directed have been identified and 
were shown to be completely conserved in mice, making 
the injection of human anti­β2­glycoprotein 1 antibodies 
in mice a good model for the human situation39.
A few papers have shown that anti­prothrombin anti­
bodies can also induce a prothrombotic phenotype40,41. 
These experiments are less convincing than the results 
obtained with anti­β2­glycoprotein 1 antibodies because 
we do not know whether the epitope on prothrombin 
to which these autoantibodies are directed is present 
in mice.
One publication shows that anticardiolipin anti­
bodies can also increase the thrombotic risk in mice, 
independently of β2­glycoprotein 1 and prothrombin42. 
However, to prove that anticardiolipin antibodies bind 
to anionic phospholipids independently of any cofactor 
is difficult. Moreover, cofactor­independent antibodies 
are common in infectious diseases that are not associated 
with an obvious increase in thrombotic risk43.
Activation of endothelial cells, platelets and immune 
cells. Binding of anti­β2­glycoprotein 1 antibodies to 
β2­glycoprotein 1 at the cell surface results in the activ­
ation of cultured endothelial cells, platelets, monocytes, 
neutrophils, fibroblasts and trophoblasts as well as 
expression and release of cell type­dependent activation 
markers33. Animal models have confirmed that infusion 
of anti­β2­glycoprotein 1 antibodies increases the pro­
tein expression of tissue factor, which is responsible for 
the activation of the coagulation cascade, in monocytes 
and vascular homogenates44.
Two important questions remain unanswered: 
which cell type is the major target for the antibodies, 
and how is this cell type activated? Different studies have 
identified different cells, but the major candidates seem 
to be platelets, endothelial cells and monocytes. It is 
possible that all are involved — directly or indirectly — 
through the shedding of prothrombotic micro 
particles45. 
How the cells are activated is a more challenging ques­
tion. Activation of the cells likely involves binding of 
the β2­glycoprotein­1–antibody complex to Toll­like 
receptor 2 (TLR2), TLR4, annexin A2 or low­density 
lipoprotein receptor­related protein 8 (LRP8; also known 
as apolipoprotein E receptor 2) and activation of their 
intracellular signal transduction pathway, resulting in a 
more prothrombotic cellular phenotype (FIG. 1). Of note, 
LRP8 associates with β2­glycoprotein 1 at the cell mem­
brane46. Studies with knockout mice have confirmed 
an important role for LRP8, annexin A2 and TLR4 in 
inducing a prothrombotic or thrombotic phenotype 
that is dependent on antiphospholipid antibodies44. 
Other receptors or a combination of the proposed recep­
tors might be necessary to activate cells, but the exact 
 
mechanism is not yet completely understood47.
Complement activation. Antiphospholipid antibodies 
also interfere with complement activation. Indeed, mice 
deficient in complement factors C3, C5 and C6 showed 
a reduced thrombotic response following antiphospho­
lipid antibody administration combined with a vascular 
challenge compared with control mice48. Clearly, both 
haemostasis and complement activation play a part in 
the induction of thrombosis by antiphospholipid anti­
bodies. However, because these enzyme cascades are 
intrinsically connected, activation of coagulation could 
be the cause and subsequent activation of complement 
could be the consequence.
Activated protein C resistance. An interesting aspect of 
antiphospholipid antibodies is that they induce activ­
ated protein C resistance in vitro; the autoantibodies 
compete with activated protein C for the binding to 
the catalytic phospholipids, thereby limiting the access 
of protein C to its substrates49. Activated protein C 
resistance strongly predisposes to venous thrombo­
embolism50. Whether the activated protein C resistance 
observed in vitro also occurs in vivo is unknown. Indeed, 
antiphospholipid antibodies also induce prolong 
ation 
of clotting in vitro51, an observation not observed in 
patients as they do not bleed52. Animal models should 
answer the role of antibody­induced activated protein C 
resistance in the risk of venous thromboembolism in 
individuals with APS.

 Pregnancy complications
The pathogenesis of recurrent first­trimester pregnancy 
loss associated with antiphospholipid antibodies is dif­
ferent from the pathogenesis of morbidity occurring in 
late pregnancy53. First­trimester pregnancy loss has been 
attributed to a direct inhibitory effect on proliferation54 
of trophoblast cells54,55.
The late obstetrical manifestations of APS, including 
pre­eclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction and still­
births, are the consequence of placental dysfunction. 
Potential causes of these outcomes are: failure of extra­
villous trophoblasts to adequately remodel the spiral 
arteries, resulting in reduced maternal blood flow to 
the placenta and hypoxic injury; inadequate delivery of 
nutrients to the fetus; and high­velocity and high­pressure 
blood flow that can damage the placenta56. Anti 
phospho­
lipid antibodies play a part by reducing proliferation 
and invasion of extravillous trophoblasts and trigger­
ing inflammation at the maternal–fetal  
interface, which 
together drive impaired placentation (FIG. 2).
Proliferation and migration of trophoblasts. β2­Glyco­
protein 1 is constitutively expressed at the cell surface by 
all placental trophoblast subpopulations and on maternal 
decidual endothelial cells57. Anti­β2­glycoprotein 1 anti­
bodies can bind to human trophoblasts and the endothe­
lium through the phospholipid binding site in domain 5 
of β2­glycoprotein 1 and in various cell surface receptors. 
Antiphospholipid antibodies in in vitro studies have been 
shown to inhibit spontaneous trophoblast migration, 
increase trophoblast antiangiogenic soluble endoglin 
secretion and disrupt trophoblast– 
endothelial inter 
actions 
in a model of spiral artery transformation58–61. These 
effects are mediated by LRP8, which, when activ 
ated by 
β2­glycoprotein 1 crosslinked by anti­β2­ 
glycoprotein 1 
antibodies, suppresses migration by reducing IL­6 levels 
and STAT3 activity59,62. The role of LRP8 in antiphospho­
lipid antibody­mediated fetal loss and intrauterine growth 
 
restriction has also been  
confirmed in vivo62 (FIG. 2a).
Inflammation. Mouse models have been instrumental 
in defining the role of local inflammation in the patho­
genesis of pregnancy complications associated with 
antiphospholipid antibodies. Administration of poly­
clonal IgG antibodies from individuals who have APS 
with high titres of antiphospholipid antibodies or mono­
clonal human antiphospholipid antibodies to pregnant 
mice results in fetal resorption and growth restriction63. 
Antiphospholipid antibodies localize to the placenta, 
and associated inflammatory responses, particularly 
complement activation and recruitment and stimulation 
of neutrophils, are an essential cause of placental insuffi­
ciency, fetal loss and growth restriction64. In addition, 
in vitro studies with human first­trimester extravillous 
trophoblasts have shown that anti­β2­glycoprotein 1 anti­
bodies trigger production of pro­inflammatory cytokines 
and chemokines (such as IL­1, IL­7 and IL­8) via TLR4 
(REF. 58) (FIG. 2b).
Complement activation stimulates release of tumour 
necrosis factor (TNF) and the antiangiogenic  
factor 
soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 
(sVEGFR1; also known as sFLT1) by infiltrating leuko­
cytes, both of which are associated with impaired placen­
tation and the development of pre­eclampsia65–67 (FIG. 2c). 
Mice deficient in components of the alternative and 
classical complement pathways and mice treated with 
various inhibitors of complement activation are resistant 
to fetal injury induced by antiphospholipid antibodies64, 
indicating that both complement pathways contrib­
ute to damage. Indeed, the effectiveness of hep 
arin in 
reducing pregnancy loss in humans may be, in part, 
because of its capacity to inhibit complement activation. 
Anticoagulation therapy with hirudin or fondaparinux, 
which do not affect complement activ 
ation, does not 
prevent pregnancy complications in antiphospholipid 
antibody­treated mice68. Complement fragment C4d, 
a marker of classical complement pathway activation, 
is present in the placentae of women with SLE and/or APS 
and women with pre­ 
eclampsia, whereas it is absent in 
healthy controls69–71. Inherited hypofunctional variants of 
complement regulators increase the risk of pre­eclampsia 
 
in women with SLE who are positive or negative for

Thrombus formation associated with the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies 
involves a multihit model in which the thrombotic response is much stronger after a 
second hit (for example, a minor vascular injury) owing to the priming of immune cells, 
platelets and endothelial cells by anti‑β2‑glycoprotein 1 antibodies (the first hit). 
Which cells or activation pathways are involved remains under investigation (inset).

 antiphospholipid antibodies72. Finally, two studies have 
shown mild hypocomplementaemia in patients with 
APS, suggesting ongoing activation and consumption of 
complement components73,74.
Complement C5a–C5aR interactions drive effectors 
of placental injury, including tissue factor expression in 
neutrophils and monocytes, oxidative burst75, release 
of antiangiogenic factors (sVEGFR1)66 and release of 
TNF (FIG. 2c). That TNF is itself pathogenetic is sug­
gested by studies showing that miscarriage induced by 
antiphospholipid antibodies is less frequent in mice defi­
cient in TNF or treated with TNF blockers65. Evidence 
that TNF contributes to the pathogenesis of adverse 
pregnancy outcomes in humans includes increased 
TNF levels in the maternal blood and amniotic fluid of 
individ 
uals with pre­ 
eclampsia76,77 and increased TNF 
levels at the fetal–maternal interface in intrauterine 
growth restriction78.
Complement activation also recruits and activates 
neutrophils (FIG. 2c). Pregnant mice treated with antiphos­
pholipid antibodies show neutrophil infiltration in the 
placenta, and the deleterious effects of antiphospholipid 
antibodies on fetal survival and growth are abolished by 
neutrophil depletion64. Similarly, in antiphospholipid 
antibody­independent mouse models of pre­eclampsia, 
neutrophils infiltrate the placenta and their depletion 
improves placental morphology, recovers spiral artery 
remodelling and improves pregnancy outcomes67. In both 
antiphospholipid antibody­ 
dependent and antiphos­
pholipid antibody­independent models, recruitment of 
neutrophils is triggered by complement activation at the 
maternal–fetal interface and leads to an increase of local 
TNF levels, reduction of VEGF levels and, ultimately, 
abnormal placentation and fetal death.
Neutrophils may also be directly activated by 
anti­β2­glycoprotein 1 antibodies that recognize β2­ 
glycoprotein bound to their cell surface and stimulate 
neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation through 
mechanisms dependent on reactive oxygen species and 
TLR479. Patients with APS show increased NET forma­
tion, impaired NET clearance and higher numbers of 
circulating low­density granulocytes, which have an 
increased capacity to produce cytokines and type 1 inter­
ferons79. Increased numbers of NETs are found infiltrating 
placental intervillous spaces, in association with inflam­
matory and vascular changes, in individuals with SLE 
and with pre­eclampsia80.
Diagnosis, screening and prevention
Antiphospholipid antibody assays
In the current classification criteria for APS (BOX 1), 
testing for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibod­
ies and anti­β2­glycoprotein 1 antibodies is included2. 
Because clinical manifestations associated with APS 
are common and often determined by other under­
lying causes, the laboratory detection of circulating 
Figure 2 | Effect of antiphospholipid antibodies on trophoblasts. Antiphospholipid antibodies recognizing 
β2‑glycoprotein 1 expressed by trophoblasts promote an anti‑angiogenic profile and reduce cell proliferation and 
migration through low‑density lipoprotein receptor‑related protein 8 (LRP8) (part a), trigger secretion of inflammatory 
cytokines and chemokines by activating Toll‑like receptor (TLR) and inflammasome pathways (part b) and activate 
complement on the cell surface, leading to neutrophil and monocyte activation with release of reactive oxygen species

 antiphospholipid antibodies defines the disease. The 
assays for the detection of antiphospholipid antibodies 
must be sufficiently sensitive and specific to correctly 
classify patients as having APS because overdiagnosis 
and misdiagnosis have severe implications for optimal 
treatment81. Thus, the performance and choice of assays 
used for detecting antiphospholipid antibodies should be 
well considered and follow the guidelines82–84. All assays 
routinely used to detect antiphospholipid antibodies 
show methodological shortcomings and lack of stand­
ardization52,53,63. Recommendations for the detection of 
lupus anticoagulant published in 2009 by the Scientific 
and Standardization Subcommittee on Antiphospholipid 
Antibodies of the International Society of Thrombosis 
and Haemostasis (SSC­ISTH) have been useful in the 
standardization of this assay82. Recommendations for the 
detection of anticardiolipin and anti­β2­ 
glycoprotein 1 
antibodies using immunoassays were published to 
 
provide additional details and specifications83 (TABLE 2).
Testing for antiphospholipid antibodies should be 
limited to patients who have a considerable probability 
of having APS. A generalized search for antiphospho­
lipid antibodies in the absence of any relevant condition 
is strongly discouraged to prevent incidental findings. 
Antiphospholipid antibodies should be tested in younger 
patients (<50 years of age) with unprovoked thrombotic 
events or thrombosis at unusual sites or in those who 
have thrombotic or pregnancy complications associated 
with autoimmune disease82,83. As antiphospholipid anti­
bodies are a heterogeneous group of autoantibodies with 
overlapping, but not identical, characteristics, it is recom­
mended to perform all assays at the same time with an 
integrated interpretation of all tests82,83 (TABLE 2).
Lupus anticoagulant. The lupus anticoagulant assay 
detects all antiphospholipid antibodies. Detection 
involves two functional coagulation assays that measure 
the ability of antiphospholipid antibodies to prolong the 
phospholipid­dependent clotting time: diluted Russell 
viper venom time (dRVVT) and the activated partial 
thromboplastin time (aPTT). An individual is consid­
ered positive for lupus anticoagulant if at least one of 
these tests is positive. Lupus anticoagulant is traditionally 
detected by a three­step procedure involving a screening, 
mixing and confirmation step82. A test is defined as lupus 
anticoagulant­positive if it has an extended coagulation 
time during the screening step, which is not reversed 
in the mixing step (where patient plasma is mixed with 
normal plasma) but is reversed in the confirmation step 
by the addition of excess phospholipids, which confirms 
that anticoagulants present in the plasma are specific for 
phospholipids (that is, antiphospholipid antibodies).
Two tests with distinct performance principles are 
needed as no coagulation test is 100% sensitive; no other 
tests but dRVVT and aPTT are recommended to 
increase the harmonization in lupus anticoagulant test­
ing using robust, reproducible, sensitive, commercially 
available and quality controlled assays. The mixing step 
is mandatory to avoid false­positive results. However, 
some discussion has been raised as coagulation might be 
corrected if antibody titres are low and because the step 
is time­consuming and reagent­consuming82,85–88. One of 
the major drawbacks of the lupus anticoagulant coagu­
lation assays is their sensitivity to anticoagu 
lant ther­
apy82,89. Elevated factor VIII or C­reactive protein may 
 
lead to false­negative or false­positive test results, respec­
tively88. The Taipan snake venom test is useful in those

 on warfarin treatment as it produces reliable lupus anti­
coagulant results, although it still labels some lupus 
 
anticoagulant­positive samples as negative90. 
Anticardiolipin antibodies and anti‑β2‑glycoprotein 1 
antibodies. Anticardiolipin antibodies and anti­β2­ 
glycoprotein 1 antibodies are measured by solid­phase 
immunoassays; the presence of either IgG or IgM iso­
types is considered diagnostic2,83. With lupus anticoagu­
lant tests, all antiphospholipid antibodies are detected 
independent of the cofactor protein of the antibodies. 
Immunoassays measure different groups of antiphos­
pholipid antibodies, that is, antibodies towards cardio­
lipin (anticardiolipin antibody assay) or towards 
β2­ 
glycoprotein 1 (anti­β2­glycoprotein 1 antibodies 
assay)91,92, the principal cofactor protein for antiphos­
pholipid antibodies91,92. Methodologically correct anti­
cardio 
lipin antibody assays with anti­β2­ 
glycoprotein 1 
in the reagents have diagnostic value with similar 
sensi 
tivities and specificities to anti­β2­glycoprotein 1 
assays93,94. Detection of the same isotype for both anti­
bodies  
reinforces the probability of APS82, which is an 
argument to keep both IgG and IgM isotypes in the 
classification criteria2,83. A recent review of the literature 
revealed that thrombosis is more strongly associated 
with IgG­type antibodies than with the IgM isotype, 
but the review did not provide an answer on how many 
cases of APS would be missed if IgM is omitted95. The 
importance of IgA­type anticardiolipin antibodies and 
anti­β2­glycoprotein 1 antibodies remains controver­
sial; measurement of this isotype is not recommended 
yet2,83. IgA testing probably has less value in screening but 
might be useful for confirmation of APS or restricted to 
patients with a strong suspicion of APS but negative for 
criteria antiphospholipid antibodies (see below)96,97. The 
anti 
cardiolipin antibodies and anti­β2­glycoprotein 1 
antibodies assays show inter 
assay variation owing to dif­
ferences in calibration and differences in assay character­
istics91,98. Coating of the solid phase differs among assays, 
resulting in different antigen exposure99. Harmonization 
of working conditions using automated systems may 
 
contribute to a reduction in interlaboratory variation100.
Antibody profile. Lupus anticoagulant positivity is 
regarded as the most important risk factor for APS­
related thrombotic events101. However, tests for all three 
antibodies must be performed to define a patient’s 
full antibody profile, as patients may be positive for only 
one of the antibodies. The concept of antiphospholipid 
antibody profiles was recommended initially in the 2006 
Sydney APS classification criteria, with a categorization 
of patients according to their positivity for single or 
multiple antiphospholipid antibodies, which supports 
the concept that the antiphospholipid antibody profile 
defines the risk of developing APS­related events2,102,103. 
A modification has been proposed that takes into 
account the type and the number of positive tests26,104. 
Indeed, evidence has shown that patients with more than 
one positive test, and particularly those who are triple­ 
positive for lupus anticoagu 
lant, anticardiolipin anti­
bodies (either IgG or IgM) and anti­β2­glycoprotein 1 
antibodies (either IgG or IgM), show the strongest 
associ 
ation with thrombotic APS105,106. Moreover,  
triple 
 
positivity in individuals with APS is associated with 
recurrence of thrombosis, whereas triple positivity 
in asymptomatic individuals is associated with first 
thrombosis26,107. In individuals with APS, those who are 
triple­positive usually maintain this profile and show 
similar results 3 months after the  
initial test108. However, 
the guidelines recommend retesting after 3 months to 
avoid overdiagnosis by classification of transient positiv­
ity of antibodies as APS, for example, as in those with 
a transient increase in antiphospholipid antibodies 
provoked by infection2,82. In addition, confirming test 
results ensure the reliability of the positive test, which 
is important in the context of poor  
standardization and 
interferences that affect the test results91,109.
Noncriteria antiphospholipid antibodies. Other 
antiphospholipid antibodies are not included in a stand­
ard test panel owing to the lack of standardization and 
the absence of evidence on the utility in patients with 
APS83,97,110,111. The anti­domain 1 β2­glycoprotein 1 
antibodies (anti­D1 antibodies), a subgroup of IgG 
anti­β2­glycoprotein 1 antibodies, were not included 
in the SSC­ISTH recommendations because adequate 
clinical studies and a commercial assay were not avail­
able at the time of writing83. A strong association of 
anti­D1 antibodies and thrombosis has been observed 
using research assays112,113. A commercial chemi 
lumin­
escence immunoassay assay has now been developed to 
detect anti­D1 antibodies, and several studies using this 
assay have confirmed a high odds ratio for thrombo­
sis and the role of anti­D1 antibodies in risk stratifica­
tion of individuals with APS114–119. Anti­D1 antibodies 
(IgG isotype) are mainly detected and present at high 
titres in triple­positive individuals115,116. However, 
anti­D1 antibodies are not considered independent 
risk factors, as illustrated in a limited number of stud­
ies115,120. Thus, detection of anti­D1 antibodies is con­
sidered a confirmation of the higher thrombotic risk, 
rather than a candidate for replacement of the anti­β2­ 
glycoprotein 1 antibodies. Addition of antibodies to 
phosphatidylserine– 
prothrombin to the current anti­
body panel shows  
promising diagnostic value121 but 
requires further investigation.
Clinical manifestations
The main clinical manifestations of APS are the occur­
rence of thrombosis (arterial and/or venous) and/or 
pregnancy morbidity, including recurrent miscarriages, 
fetal deaths and late pregnancy complications such as 
pre­ 
eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. 
In addition, APS can be associated with a wide variety 
of other clinical symptoms (FIG. 3).
In the past, the terms ‘primary APS’ and ‘secondary 
APS’ have been used. ‘Secondary’ indicated that APS was 
associated with another systemic autoimmune disease, 
usually SLE. However, we have refrained from using 
these terms, as follow­up of individuals with APS showed 
that most patients acquired other autoimmune diseases. 
Furthermore, APS is not ‘secondary’ to SLE in its effect.

 Thrombosis. Single or multiple thrombi in veins, arteries 
and the microvasculature and the time interval between 
these manifestations may vary from days to years. This 
variability in location of the thrombi results in the wide 
spectrum of clinical presentations that may involve many 
organ systems52,122 (FIG. 3).
Venous thromboembolism, particularly deep vein 
thrombosis of the lower limbs, is the most frequent mani­
festation of APS, with a prevalence of ~39% in the Euro­
Phospholipid Project122. Although arterial thrombosis is 
less common than venous thromboembolism, it is usually 
more severe and life­threatening. Indeed, 20% of individ­
uals with APS developed a stroke and 11% developed a 
transient ischaemic attack. The recurrence rate of throm­
botic events in the untreated individuals after unpro­
voked first events is high and ranges from 19% to 29% 
per year123. Positivity for lupus anticoagulant, triple posi­
tivity and isolated, persistent positivity for anti 
cardiolipin 
antibodies at medium­high titres are associated with an 
increased risk of developing thrombosis124.
According to the APS classification criteria, thrombo­
sis must be confirmed by objective validated criteria, such 
as unequivocal findings of appropriate imaging studies 
or histopathology. For histopathological confirmation, 
thrombosis should be present without  
considerable 
 
evidence of inflammation in the vessel wall2.
Obstetrical morbidity. Obstetrical APS can be associ­
ated with various pregnancy complications, of which 
recurrent miscarriage at <10 weeks of gestation is the 
most frequent15. The maternal pregnancy morbidity of 
APS consists of pre­eclampsia, eclampsia and placen­
tal abruptions. Despite the transplacental transfer of 
maternal antiphospholipid antibodies, babies born to 
 
mothers with APS do not seem to have thrombosis or 
SLE125. Several risk factors predict poor pregnancy out­
come, including an associated systemic autoimmune 
disease, in particular SLE, a history of previous throm­
botic events, reduced complement levels126 and lupus 
 
anticoagulant positivity or triple positivity15,127.
Reduced blood flow in the uterine arteries measured 
by Doppler velocimetry is an indirect indicator for the 
development of placental insufficiency and/or pre­ 
eclampsia128. Thus, pregnant women with APS should 
be offered obstetrical ultrasonography to assess fetal 
growth and amniotic fluid volume and second­trimester 
Doppler ultrasonography to assess end­diastolic blood 
flow in the umbilical artery. Normal end­diastolic 
blood flow in the uterine artery results at 20–24 weeks of 
gestation is a strong predictor for good fetal outcome129. 
In a study of 33 women with APS, the positive predic­
tive value of abnormal uterine artery Doppler ultra­
sonography for later intrauterine growth restriction or 
Figure 3 | Clinical manifestation of antiphospholipid syndrome. Antiphospholipid antibodies are associated with a 
variety of symptoms; in particular, deep vein thrombosis, pregnancy morbidity and stroke are frequent (occurring >20% of 
individuals with antiphospholipid antibodies). Other manifestations vary in frequency, ranging from less frequent (10–20% 
of individuals with antiphospholipid antibodies), unusual (<10%) and rare (<1%). For example, an unusual manifestation is 
thrombotic microangiopathy (not shown), which manifests in the skin, kidneys and/or heart. Livedo reticularis most 
commonly occurs on the upper arms and thighs. Images courtesy of Y. Shoenfeld.

 pre­eclampsia was 67% with a negative predictive value 
of 93%130. Another prospective study of 100 pregnan­
cies confirmed that Doppler ultrasonography in the 
 
second trimester is the best predictor for late pregnancy 
outcome in SLE and/or APS129. The European League 
Against Rheumatism (EULAR) has now included 
recom 
mendations on the use of  
uterine artery Doppler 
 
ultrasonography in their guideline131.
Neurological manifestations. Stroke is the most com­
mon and severe neurological manifestation of APS. 
However, many other neurological manifestations that 
are not included in the criteria have been associated 
with antiphospholipid antibodies, including cognitive 
dysfunction (owing to several cerebral small  
vessel 
thromboses), untreatable headaches and migraine, 
epilepsy and chorea132. Epilepsy is strongly associated 
with previous strokes and transient ischaemic attack, 
SLE, valvulopathy and livedo reticularis (a red or bluish 
alteration of the skin with a net­like pattern attributed 
to blood stasis and, occasionally, fibrin deposition in 
distal venules)133.
Cardiac manifestations. Cardiac features associated 
with APS vary from valve lesions to accelerated athero­
sclerosis, myocardial infarction, intracardiac thrombi, 
pulmonary hypertension, cardiomyopathy and diastolic 
dysfunction134. Cardiac valve abnormalities are observed 
in 30–50% of individuals with APS and mainly include 
valve thickening and regurgitations, but valve vegeta­
tions (for example, Libman–Sacks endocarditis) and 
valve stenosis also occur135,136. The mitral valve is most 
commonly involved, followed by the aortic valve. Valve 
damage is most frequent in individuals with APS who 
also have another autoimmune disease137. Myocardial 
ischaemic events can result from coronary thrombosis 
without underlying atherosclerosis, accelerated athero­
sclerosis of the coronary arteries or microvascular injury. 
Myocardial infarction is observed in ~5.5% of patients 
in APS registries52,138.
Thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia occurs in 
at least 30% of individuals with APS and is most 
marked at times of thrombosis formation52. However, 
thrombo 
cytopenia might also be associated with other 
systemic manifestations of APS, such as obstetrical 
morbidity, venous and/or arterial thrombosis, myo­
cardial infarction and valve vegetations139. The preva­
lence of thrombocytopenia was found to be higher in 
individ 
uals with APS who also have SLE than in those 
with APS alone52,139. However, platelet counts usually 
remain >50 × 109 per litre; consequently, thrombo­
cyto 
penia rarely results in major bleeding and does 
not require intervention. A positive Coombs test (con­
firming anti­erythrocyte antibodies) occurs in 10% 
of individuals with APS but is rarely associated with 
autoimmune haemolysis140.
Pulmonary manifestations. Pulmonary emboli and 
infarction are the most frequent pulmonary mani­
festations, affecting ~14% of individuals with APS52. 
Other manifestations are pulmonary hypertension, 
acute  
respiratory distress syndrome and intra­alveolar 
haemorrhage141.
Dermatological manifestations. Dermatological fea­
tures may be the first clinical presentations of APS. 
The most frequent is livedo reticularis, which occurs in 
16–25% of patients142. Livedo reticularis may be a prog­
nostic marker of more­severe disease associated with 
the arterial and microangiopathic subtypes of APS143,144. 
Other manifestations include digital gangrene, skin ulcer­
ations, superficial skin necrosis, pseudo 
vasculitis lesions 
and pyoderma gangrenosum­like lesions,  
characterized 
by deep, necrotic ulcers142.
Renal manifestations. Thrombosis might also result in 
renal manifestations. A thrombotic microangio 
pathy 
associated with antiphospholipid antibodies might 
mani 
fest with a slow, occult onset of haematuria, protein­
uria (ranging from mild to nephrotic) and renal insuffi­
ciency, or it may develop acutely and present with acute 
renal failure and hypertension145. Ideally, the diagnosis 
of antiphospholipid antibody­associated nephropathy 
should be supported by a kidney biopsy146, particularly 
in those with SLE in whom nephropathy may be isolated 
or concomitant with lupus nephritis.
Catastrophic APS. Catastrophic APS — a rare, life­ 
threatening form of APS occurring in <1% of patients 
 
— is defined as intravascular thrombosis affecting three 
or more organs, systems and/ 
or tissues either simul­
taneously or within 1 week with histological confirma­
tion of small vessel occlusion147. Although catastrophic 
APS usually involves small vessel thrombosis, large 
 
vessels are often occluded as well. Of all individuals 
who develop catastrophic APS, 60% only have APS, 
whereas 40% have APS associated with another systemic 
autoimmune disease7. Infections are the most common 
precipitating factor of catastrophic APS; 49% of individ­
uals who develop catastrophic APS have had a previous 
infection147. The most common systems involved in cata­
strophic APS are the kidneys (in 73% of individuals with 
catastrophic APS), pulmonary system (in 60%), brain 
(in 56%), cardiac system (in 50%) and skin (in 47%). 
Among laboratory findings, thrombocytopenia is most 
frequently observed in individuals with catastrophic 
APS (in 67%), followed by schistocytes (fragmented red 
blood cells; in 22%). The 12­year mortality was 37% in 
the CAPS Registry (an international registry of patients 
with catastrophic APS)147.
Management
Thrombosis
Primary thromboprophylaxis is used to describe the 
prevention of thrombosis in those without previous 
clots, whereas secondary thromboprophylaxis describes 
prevention of clot recurrence following a first throm­
botic event. Thromboprophylaxis remains one of the 
major challenges in APS. Conventional management 
of cardio 
vascular risk factors by lifestyle changes is key 
in primary thromboprophylaxis. The use of antiplatelet

 agents such as low­dose aspirin (LDA) should be limited 
to individuals at very high risk3. Secondary thrombo­
prophylaxis is based on anticoagulation, mainly with 
vitamin K antagonists (such as warfarin or heparin), 
although direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs; such as 
rivaroxaban) might have a role as well3.
Primary thromboprophylaxis. The presence of anti­
phospholipid antibodies in asymptomatic individuals 
is a risk factor for thrombosis. To date, no ran 
domized 
controlled trials (RCTs) have eliminated the antiphos­
pholipid antibodies or their activity; thus, lifestyle 
modifi 
cations to address conventional cardio 
vascular 
risk factors in individuals with APS, regardless of 
thrombosis history, concomitant SLE or other features 
of APS, seem logical despite the lack of clinical trials 
to support this recommendation148,149. Modifications 
include  
cessation of tobacco smoking and addressing 
 
hypertension, obesity and hyperlipidaemia.
Management of asymptomatic individuals with 
persistent antiphospholipid antibodies is assessed on 
an individual basis, taking the presence of additional 
cardio 
vascular risk factors into account3. Individuals 
with a high­risk profile (that is, those with high antiphos­
pholipid antibody titres, triple positivity or additional 
cardio 
vascular risk factors) may be considered for 
 
primary prevention with LDA or hydroxychloro 
quine3. 
In high­risk situations, such as surgery and long­
term immobilization and in postpartum women, all 
individ 
uals with persistent antiphospholipid antibody 
positivity should receive thromboprophylaxis with 
 
low­molecular­weight heparin (LMWH).
In an RCT of LDA versus placebo150 in those with 
antiphospholipid antibodies without clinical symptoms, 
the incidence rate of acute thrombosis in the placebo 
arm was 0 per 100 patient­years; the trial was under­
powered to detect any effect of LDA150. A meta­ 
analysis 
including 11 (mainly observational) studies of LDA 
versus placebo involving 1,208 antiphospholipid anti­
body­positive individ 
uals with 139 thrombotic events 
suggested that treatment with LDA in those with iso­
lated antiphospholipid antibodies and those with APS 
is associated with a 50% risk reduction of thrombosis 
occurrence151. However, LDA treatment is associated 
with an increased bleeding risk. In a meta­analysis 
including >95,000 individuals from six RCTs, LDA 
intake increased the annual risk of developing a major 
bleed from 0.007% to 0.10%152. Older age (>65 years), 
male sex, diabetes mellitus and hypertension were risk 
factors for bleeding in those taking LDA152.
Hydroxychloroquine has been suggested as an alter­
native to LDA in the setting of primary prevention. 
Hydroxychloroquine is used in the clinical setting on the 
basis of empiric evidence and in vitro data153,154, but no 
rigorous RCTs have been performed155.
Patients with previous obstetrical complications 
associ 
ated with antiphospholipid antibodies have a 
higher risk of future thrombosis than the general popu­
lation. No specific treatment recommendation for the 
prevention of thrombosis in patients with a previous 
history of antiphospholipid antibody­related pregnancy 
complications currently exists. However, a retrospective 
cohort showed that those with obstetrical APS devel­
oped a thrombotic event later at a rate of 7.4 per 100 
patient­years in the nontreated group and 1.3 per 
100 patient­years in the group that received LDA156.
Those with SLE and antiphospholipid antibodies 
may develop thrombotic events at a rate of 4% per 
year. The current EULAR guidelines recommend LDA 
for primary thrombosis prevention for antiphospho­
lipid antibody­positive patients with SLE3,157. Primary 
thromboprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine with or 
without LDA can be considered for individuals with 
SLE who are positive for lupus anticoagulant or who 
have persistent anticardiolipin antibodies at medium to 
high titres157.
Secondary thromboprophylaxis. Venous thrombo­
embolic events can be separated into provoked or 
 
unprovoked events; provoking factors include recent 
hospital admission, the use of oestrogen­containing 
medication or pregnancy. In provoked events, many 
physicians give only a short course of anticoagulation 
(3–6 months), irrespective of the presence of anti­
phospholipid antibodies, and then provide thrombo­
prophylaxis at the time of haemostatic stress as one 
would do in anyone with a previous thrombotic event. 
Unprovoked venous thrombosis and arterial thrombo­
sis are of concern and should be treated with indefinite 
anticoagulation therapy with a vitamin K antagonist 
(for example, warfarin) or, occasionally, LMWH3. More 
recently, the use of DOACs has been considered158. 
BOX 2 outlines the current recommendations of the 
13th European Task Force on Antiphospholipid anti­
bodies3 for second 
ary  
thromboprophylaxis in APS in 
the setting of thrombosis3.
Two systematic reviews on vitamin K antagonists 
have been published123,159. Lim et al.159 included three 
RCTs involving individuals with APS with a history of 
arterial and venous thromboembolism. Two of these 
RCTs focused on the intensity of warfarin used160,161, and 
both showed comparable rates of thrombosis and bleed­
ing in patients treated with vitamin K antagonists tar­
geted to achieve an international normalized ratio (INR; 
a parameter used to standardize prothrombin time) 
of 2–3 compared with high­intensity treatment (that is, 
a target INR of 3–4). However, the time in range in one 
of the studies for the INR 3–4 arm was only 14%161, and 
no benefit of high­intensity treatment was found in the 
second study160. The systemic review by Lim et al.159 con­
cluded that patients with venous and arterial thrombo­
sis without cerebral events should be treated indefinitely 
with oral anticoagulants targeted at INR 2–3, whereas a 
target INR of 1.4–2.8 is recommended for those patients 
with a previous stroke. However, it is important to note 
that this systemic review excluded high­risk patients 
with recurrent vascular events despite anticoagulation, 
and these patients may require high­intensity treatment 
with vitamin K antagonists according to current guide­
lines. By contrast, Ruiz­Irastorza et al.123 conducted a sys­
tematic review based on 12 cohort studies and 4 RCTs, 
including a total of 1,740 patients. Most included studies

 were of evidence level II or III. In general, recurrent 
thrombotic events in these studies occurred in patients 
on vitamin K antagonists with an INR of <3. Patients 
with previous arterial events were at an increased risk of 
recurrences when treated with oral anticoagulation to a 
target INR of 2–3. Notably, recurrences were infrequent 
among those patients treated with vitamin K antago­
nists targeting an INR of 3–4 (REF. 123). In conclusion, 
the recommendations from this systematic review were 
to treat patients with a first­time venous thrombosis and 
definitive APS with warfarin at a target INR of 2–3 
and with a target INR >3 in the case of recurrent venous 
or arterial thrombosis123.
The DOAC rivaroxaban was compared to warfarin 
(INR target of 2–3) for secondary thromboprophylaxis 
in APS with previous venous thromboembolism in an 
open­label, multicentre, noninferiority RCT includ­
ing 116 patients (the RAPS trial)162. The trial did not 
reach its primary end point, defined as the change in 
endogenous thrombin potential at day 42 (that is, it did 
not reach the noninferiority threshold), but the peak 
thrombin gener 
ation was lower in the rivaroxaban group 
than in the warfarin groups; thus, rivaroxaban might 
be an alternative to vitamin K antagonist treatment162. 
Furthermore, complement activation products of the 
classical pathway (C3a and C5a) and terminal pathway 
(SC5b­9) were significantly reduced in patients assigned 
to rivaroxaban compared with patients assigned to 
warfarin, highlighting that rivaroxaban may have 
effects in addition to anticoagulation163. Further stud­
ies assessing the role of DOACs in thrombosis associ­
ated with APS are currently ongoing and results are 
eagerly awaited164–166. Of concern are a handful of case 
reports with severe adverse events — usually recurrent 
thrombosis,  
especially  
arterial thrombosis — in patients 
treated with DOACs167–169.
The Antiphospholipid Antibodies and Stroke Study 
(APASS), a prospective nested cohort, included 1,770 
patients with antiphospholipid antibody­related ischae­
mic stroke and compared the efficacy of LDA (n = 889) 
with warfarin (n = 881) on a composite outcome of 
death, stroke, transient ischaemic attack, myocardial 
infarction, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism 
and other systemic thrombotic events170. No significant 
difference in event rate between LDA and warfarin was 
found. However, a major drawback was that patients 
included in the APASS did not fulfil the APS classifi­
cation criteria as antiphospholipid antibodies were 
measured only once (instead of twice with a 12­week 
period)2. Thus, it is difficult to conclude that the studied 
cohort consisted of patients with APS170.
The efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in reducing 
thrombotic rates was first reported in patients with 
SLE171,172. In patients with thrombotic APS (n = 40), 
hydroxychloroquine combined with vitamin K antago­
nists (target INR of 2–3) was not associated with recur­
rent thrombo 
embolic events, whereas 30% of the control 
group who were treated with vitamin K antagonists 
alone experienced a recurrent event (P = 0.0086)173. How 
hydroxychloroquine exerts its antithrombotic effects in 
APS remains uncertain. Recent in vivo data suggest that 
hydroxychloroquine might alter tissue factor expres­
sion174. In summary, these studies suggest a role for 
hydroxychloroquine in the prevention of thrombosis 
in APS.
Acute management of patients with catastrophic 
APS is based on anticoagulation, corticosteroids, plasma 
exchange and/or intravenous immunoglobulin admin­
istration according to expert opinion based on data 
from the CAPS Registry175. No prospective trials have 
been conducted.
Antiphospholipid antibody­associated clinical mani­
festations suggesting underlying thrombotic micro 
angio­
pathic processes (such as skin necrosis or renal disease) 
require close follow­up176, but no RCTs can inform the 
most efficacious treatment choices. However, anecdotal 
evidence supports the use of warfarin with a target INR 
of 3–4 in those with microvascular thrombosis.
An observational, multicentre study involving 177 
patients with thrombotic APS and a median follow­up 
of 5 years (range 1–26) showed that the thrombotic 
recurrence rate in APS was 7.5 per 100 patient­years in 
the first 5 years after the first event despite anticoagu­
lation. Diabetes mellitus, inherited thrombophilia and 
oral anticoagulation withdrawal were independent risk 
factors for recurrence177. As such, many clinical APS 
experts feel that patients with previous arterial throm­
bosis or recurrent thrombotic events require a more 
aggressive approach towards secondary prophylaxis 
Box 2 | Secondary thromboprophylaxis in APS
Treatment groups
• Individuals who are positive for antiphospholipid antibodies and who have had an 
arterial or venous thrombosis but do not meet criteria for antiphospholipid syndrome 
(APS)* should be managed in the same way as antiphospholipid antibody-negative 
patients with thrombotic events.
• Patients with definite APS* and a first venous thrombosis should receive oral 
anticoagulant therapy to a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2–3.
• Patients with definite APS* and arterial thrombosis should receive vitamin K 
antagonists with a target INR of >3 or vitamin K antagonists with a target INR of 2–3 
in combination with low-dose aspirin.
• Bleeding risk should always be assessed before starting high-intensity anticoagulant 
therapy or combined antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy.
• For patients without systemic lupus erythematosus with a first noncardioembolic 
cerebral arterial event who have a low-risk antiphospholipid antibody profile‡ and 
reversible triggers, antiplatelet agents should be considered on an individual basis.
Duration of treatment
• Duration of therapy in patients with definite APS* and thrombosis is indefinite3.
• Anticoagulation could be limited to 3–6 months in patients with a first venous 
event with a low-risk antiphospholipid antibody profile‡ and a known transient 
precipitating factor.
Refractory and difficult cases
Potential alternative therapies for patients who have recurrent thrombosis, fluctuating 
INR levels or major bleeding, or, for those who are at high risk of major bleeding, include 
long-term low-molecular-weight heparin, hydroxychloroquine or statins.
Treatment recommendations of the 13th European Task Force on Antiphospholipid antibodies3 
adapted from the evidence-based recommendations for the prevention and long-term 
management of thrombosis in individuals who are positive for antiphospholipid antibodies  
or in those with APS. *BOX 1 shows the classification criteria for definite APS2. ‡Low-risk 
antiphospholipid antibody profile: isolated, intermittently positive anticardiolipin antibodies 
or anti-β2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies at low titres to medium titres.

 than the recommended warfarin treatment targeted at 
INR 2–3, despite little high­quality evidence1,3. Options 
are either high­intensity vitamin K antagonist treatment 
(INR 3–4) or vitamin K antagonists (INR 2–3) combined 
with other agents such as antiplatelet agents.
Obstetrical complications
With current consensus management (TABLE 3), the 
overall live birth rate in women with obstetrical APS 
is around 70%178. Women with antiphospholipid anti­
bodies and APS should receive counselling before preg­
nancy and close surveillance during pregnancy131. The 
specific objective of antenatal care in pregnant women 
with APS is close observation for maternal thrombosis, 
antiphospholipid  
antibody­related renal manifesta­
tions and  
features of pre­eclampsia and monitoring of 
fetal growth.
Risk stratification. A complete history and antiphos­
pholipid antibody profile should be available before 
conception to aid risk stratification. Risk factors include 
a high­risk antiphospholipid antibody profile (BOX 2), 
coexisting SLE, previous thrombotic APS and adverse 
pregnancy outcomes131, of which previous pregnancy 
outcomes is the best predictor179. Moreover, individuals 
with obstetrical APS can be separated into three different 
clinical phenotypes (that is, those with recurrent early 
pregnancy loss, those with previous ischaemic placental 
complications and those with previous maternal throm­
boses); each of these phenotypes is associated with dif­
ferent pregnancy outcomes. In a series of 83 pregnancies 
in 67 women, women with a previous history of throm­
bosis had less favourable neonatal outcomes with higher 
rates of preterm delivery (26.8% versus 4.7%, P = 0.05) 
and babies of small gestational size (9.5% versus 4.8%, 
P = 0.003) compared with those with a previous history 
of recurrent pregnancy loss at <10 weeks of gestation179. 
Limited data are available assessing pregnancy perfor­
mance in women with a history of stroke. In one pro­
spectively study including 23 pregnancies in 20 women 
with APS and previous stroke and/or transient ischaemic 
attack, 8 women developed pre­eclampsia and 3 women 
had a recurrent stroke despite treatment with LDA and 
LMWH180. All women with pulmonary hypertension, 
including those with APS as a cause, should be discour­
aged from pregnancy as maternal mortality is as high 
as 43%1,181.
Obstetrical APS. Despite limited evidence, the stand­
ard of care for individuals with obstetrical APS is LDA, 
intermediate­dose LMWH or unfractionated heparin to 
prevent antiphospholipid antibody­related obstetrical 
complications131,182. Mothers with a previous history of 
thrombosis require intermediate or full­dose anticoagu­
lation (usually LMWH) throughout pregnancy to pre­
vent further thrombotic events. The prevention of early 
recurrent miscarriages as opposed to placental­mediated 
complications in the second and third trimesters is the 
field in obstetrical APS in which most clinical trials have 
been published. TABLE 3 summarizes the current recom­
mendations for the treatment of pregnant women with 
antiphospholipid antibodies or APS.
The current recommendations are based on two RCTs 
in which women with antiphospholipid antibody­ 
related 
recurrent first­trimester pregnancy losses were randomly 
assigned to either LDA or a combination of LDA and 
unfractionated heparin183,184. The combin 
ation of LDA 
and unfractionated heparin showed a significantly higher

 rate of live births versus LDA alone (71% versus 42%)183. 
The other RCT of 50 women alternately assigned either 
to the combination of LDA and heparin (unfractionated 
heparin or LMWH) or to LDA alone showed a signifi­
cantly higher live birth rate associated with LDA and 
heparin (80% versus 44%)184. However, no differences 
in outcome with combination therapy versus LDA were 
found in two other RCTs. Indeed, an RCT of 98 women 
with recurrent miscarriages found no difference in live 
birth rate compared with women who were randomized 
to LDA alone (78% versus 72%)185. In the HepASA trial 
of 859 women with recurrent pregnancy loss, LDA and 
LMWH did not result in a significantly better live birth 
rate than LDA alone (79.1% versus 77.8%)186. The con­
flicting results of these four trials might be caused by the 
variation in live birth rates in those women randomized 
to LDA arms. Two other RCTs on unfractionated heparin 
compared with LMWH in women with recurrent preg­
nancy loss and antiphospholipid antibodies did not find 
a significant difference187,188. A 2015 Cochrane review 
concluded that treatment with unfractionated heparin 
in  
combination with LDA may reduce pregnancy loss 
by 54%189.
Good clinical evidence is available for the use of LDA 
in women to reduce the risk of hypertensive dis 
orders in 
 
pregnancy (such as pre­eclampsia and eclamp 
sia). 
As the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies increases 
the risk of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, LDA is 
offered to all individuals who have  
antiphospholipid 
antibodies190–192.
Refractory obstetrical APS. Treatment options to 
improve pregnancy outcomes refractory to LDA and 
heparin include low­dose prednisolone in recurrent 
first­trimester pregnancy loss, which, when combined 
with conventional treatment with LDA and LMWH 
administered from positive pregnancy test until week 14, 
improved the rate of live births in refractory antiphos­
pholipid antibody­related pregnancy loss or losses to 
61% in a retrospective cohort of 18 patients193. The use 
of intravenous immunoglobulins has been assessed 
in two RCTs. The first trial, in which 40 women with 
antiphospholipid antibody­related recurrent first­ 
trimester pregnancy loss were randomized to either 
intravenous immuno 
globulins or the combination of 
LDA and LMWH, failed to show any benefit of intra­
venous immunoglobulins194. Furthermore, in a second 
trial, in which 16 women were randomized to intra­
venous immunoglobulins or the combination of placebo 
with LDA and LMWH, intravenous immunoglobulins 
did not show a benefit on obstetrical or neonatal out­
comes over LDA and LMWH195. However, women ran­
domly assigned to the intravenous immunoglobulins arm 
had a lower rate of fetal growth restriction (14% versus 
33%, P >0.05) and neonatal intensive care admission 
(14% versus 44%, P >0.05), which led some clinicians to 
consider  
intravenous  
immunoglobulins as adjuvant in 
refractory cases196.
A case–control study in patients with established 
antiphospholipid antibody­related pre­eclampsia 
and/or intrauterine growth restriction suggests a role for 
pra 
vastatin (a drug of the statin family)197. Eleven patients 
treated with pravastatin in combination with LDA and 
LWMH were compared with women receiving only LDA 
and LMWH. In all patients in the pravastatin group, signs 
of pre­eclampsia and placental perfusion remained static, 
whereas the control group progressed197.
Lastly, some studies suggest that hydroxychloroquine 
reduces the rate of antiphospholipid antibody­related 
adverse pregnancy outcomes198,199. In a retrospective, 
multi 
centre cohort of women with refractory obstetri­
cal APS, fewer first­trimester miscarriages (81% to 19%, 
P <0.05) and improved live birth rates to 78% (P <0.05) 
were reported when women received hydroxy 
chloroquine 
compared with previous pregnancies in which most 
received LDA and LMWH199. In another retrospective 
review of 96 women with persistent antiphospholipid 
antibodies with 170 pregnancies, hydroxychloroquine 
use was associated with a higher rate of live births of 67% 
versus 57% in women treated with LDA and LMWH 
(P <0.05) and a lower prevalence of pregnancy morbidity 
in women treated with hydroxy 
chloroquine in addition to 
standard of care (LDA and LMWH) compared with those 
who only received standard of care (47% versus 63%; 
P = 0.004)198. The HYPATIA study, a multicentre RCT of 
hydroxychloroquine versus placebo in addition to stan­
dard of care in women with persistent antiphospholipid 
antibodies planning for pregnancy, is about to start200.
Late obstetrical complications. There is limited evi­
dence on the prevention of recurrent antiphospholipid 
antibody­related complications in the second and third 
trimesters. One RCT involving women with a previous 
history of antiphospholipid antibody­related delivery 
at <34 weeks of gestation with hypertensive disorder 
and/or small­for­gestational­age baby comparing LDA 
with LMWH plus LDA showed no benefit of LMWH; 
however, the study was underpowered201. The TIPSS trial, 
an open­label multicentre trial of 292 women with vari­
ous thrombophilias, assessed the efficacy of an LMWH, 
dalteparin, versus no dalteparin in the prevention of a 
composite outcome of pregnancy­ 
related venous throm­
boembolism, pregnancy loss and ischaemic  
placental 
complications, such as severe pre­ 
eclampsia, intra­
uterine growth restriction and placental abruption. This 
study showed that dalteparin did not alter the  
primary 
 
composite outcome but was also underpowered202.
Quality of life
Data from the European multicentre cohort, which 
included 820 individuals of different ethnicities from 
13 European countries who were prospectively  
followed­ 
up for 10 years, showed that individuals with APS had a 
mortality of 9.3%, but the severity of APS and the treat­
ment during this period were unclear. Thrombosis and 
its consequences, such as ischaemic stroke, myocardial 
infarction, pulmonary embolism and catastrophic APS, 
were the predominant cause of death, causing one­third 
of all deaths52.
A history of previous thrombosis has been associated 
with a reduced quality of life (QOL), irrespective of a 
diagnosis of APS203, and thrombosis is the best­ 
studied

 clinical manifestation in terms of QOL in individ­
uals with APS. A case–control study of 826 individuals 
with SLE with previous thrombosis, of whom 143 had 
antiphospholipid antibodies, reported a lower score on 
the mental and physical domains of the 36­Item Short­
Form Health Survey204. These findings were similar to an 
online survey assessing QOL in 270 individuals with APS 
who were members of the Hughes Foundation, which 
showed that health­related QOL is significantly lower 
in individuals with APS than in healthy, age­matched 
controls205. Another study using this online survey 
also showed that insufficient social support was linked 
to a reduced health­related QOL and highlighted the 
 
importance of disease­specific patient education206.
Recurrent pregnancy loss, intrauterine growth 
restriction, pre­eclampsia and/or late fetal loss have an 
impact on QOL, but to the best of our knowledge no 
published data have assessed QOL in individuals with 
obstetrical APS.
Finally, the warfarin treatment itself might have 
an impact on QOL owing to food interactions and the 
need for INR monitoring. The RAPS trial collected data 
on QOL as a secondary outcome, and patients assigned 
to the rivaroxaban arm reported better QOL than the 
 
warfarin group158.
Outlook
Diagnosis and classification
To increase the future comparability of clinical studies of 
APS, better standardization of both clinical and labora­
tory criteria is required. Indeed, the lack of standardiza­
tion of testing for antiphospholipid antibodies remains 
a great concern. Furthermore, validation of antibodies 
directed against prothrombin, the phosphatidylserine– 
prothrombin complex, specific protein domains such as 
domain 1 of β2­glycoprotein 1 and proteins that affect 
the anticoagulant activity of annexin A5 is required, as is 
validation of the IgA isotype of anticardio 
lipin antibodies 
and anti­β2­glycoprotein 1 antibodies. Additional tests 
may offer subclassification of APS and better character­
ization of future risk of thromboses. As we learn more 
about APS, the clinical criteria included in the diagnostic 
categories may also change207. Future classification criteria 
may include several APS­associated manifestations that 
are not currently included in the criteria2,208,209, including 
heart valve lesions, renal  
manifestations, livedo reticularis 
and thrombocytopenia.
Risk stratification and recurrence risk
Several antiphospholipid antibodies have been identi­
fied and weighted with respect to their ability to predict 
thrombosis and pregnancy loss, resulting in the develop­
ment of the Global Anti­Phospholipid Syndrome Score 
(GAPSS)210 (BOX 3), which has been validated in APS211 
and SLE with antiphospholipid antibodies212. High 
GAPSS predicted incident thrombosis better than just 
the presence of the classical antiphospholipid antibod­
ies and, consequently, may guide treatment decisions in 
clinical practice213. The GAPPS also includes non­APS 
risk factors, acknowledging the clinically important 
point that thrombosis risk in individuals with APS is 
also influenced by concomitant cardiovascular throm­
botic risk factors such as arterial hypertension and 
hyperlipidaemia. It is of interest to stratify for the risk 
of a first thrombotic event as well as the risk of recurrent 
thrombosis. The GAPPS is useful in predicting the risk 
of recurrent thrombosis211,214.
Management
As traditional cardiovascular risk factors add to the 
thrombotic risk associated with the presence of antiphos­
pholipid antibodies, future treatment strategies should 
ensure modification of concomitant risk factors. The 
role of statins is of particular interest because they have 
the dual functionality of inhibiting cholesterol synthesis 
and modulating inflammatory responses. In the general 
popu 
lation, statin treatment also reduces the rates of 
venous thromboembolism215. Fluvastatin reduces pro­ 
inflammatory and prothrombotic markers in individuals 
who are positive for antiphospholipid anti 
bodies216 and 
pravastatin improves pregnancy outcomes in a cohort of 
pregnant women with refractory APS197.
The positive outcomes associated with statin treat­
ment support the notion that the pathogenesis of APS 
involves inflammatory and thrombogenic pathways. 
Thus, cell activation and complement activation medi­
ated by antiphospholipid antibodies play a central part in 
APS pathology. Accoringly, it is of great interest that in a 
murine model of obstetrical APS, hydroxychloroquine was 
able to prevent placental and fetal abnormalities in paral­
lel to lowering serum C5a levels154; we await the results of 
a trial of hydroxychloroquine in pregnant women with 
 
antiphospholipid antibodies (HYPATIA study)200. 
Future management trials may include B cell­directed 
therapy and complement inhibition with rituximab and 
eculizumab217. In a systematic review of haemato 
poietic 
stem cell transplantation in refractory APS, 32 of 44 (73%) 
individuals were able to discontinue anticoagulation 
after transplantation218. Although this procedure  
carries 
a considerable mortality risk, it is still of interest that 
remission could be induced in APS. As our knowledge 
of the pathogenesis of APS steadily increases, we will gain 
a better understanding of APS and will be able to iden­
tify opportunities to investigate new paradigm­shifting 
 
therapeutic targets.
Box 3 | The Global Anti‑Phospholipid Syndrome Score
The Global Anti-Phospholipid Syndrome Score (GAPSS)210 is a scoring system to predict 
the risk of thrombosis (either first or recurrent) and pregnancy morbidity. The system 
consists of a combination of independent risk of thrombosis and pregnancy loss, 
including the antiphospholipid antibody profile and conventional cardiovascular risk 
factors. The GAPSS can be calculated for each patient by adding the points 
corresponding to the different risk factors, including presence of
• Anticardiolipin antibodies (immunoglobulin G (IgG) or IgM isotype): 5 points
• Anti-β2-glycoprotein antibodies (IgG or IgM isotype): 4 points
• Lupus anticoagulant: 4 points
• Anti-prothrombin/phosphatidylserine complex antibodies (IgG or IgM isotype): 
3 points
• Hyperlipidaemia: 3 points
• Arterial hypertension: 1 point
