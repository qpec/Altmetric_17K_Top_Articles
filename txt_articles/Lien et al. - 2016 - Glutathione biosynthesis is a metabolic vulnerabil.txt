Abstract
Cancer cells often select for mutations that enhance signaling through pathways that promote 
anabolic metabolism1. Although the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which is frequently 
dysregulated in breast cancer2, is a well-established regulator of central glucose metabolism and 
aerobic glycolysis3,4, its regulation of other metabolic processes required for tumor growth is not 
well defined. Here we report that in mammary epithelial cells, oncogenic PI3K/Akt stimulates 
glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis by stabilizing and activating Nrf2 to up-regulate the GSH 
biosynthetic genes. Increased Nrf2 stability is dependent on the Akt-mediated accumulation of 
p21Cip1/WAF1 and GSK-3 inhibition. Consistently, in human breast tumors, up-regulation of Nrf2 
targets is associated with PI3K pathway mutation status and oncogenic Akt activation. Elevated 
GSH biosynthesis is required for PI3K/Akt-driven resistance to oxidative stress, initiation of tumor 
spheroids, and anchorage-independent growth. Furthermore, inhibition of GSH biosynthesis with 
buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) synergizes with cisplatin (CDDP) to selectively induce tumor 
regression in PI3K pathway mutant breast cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings

 provide insight into GSH biosynthesis as a metabolic vulnerability associated with PI3K pathway 
mutant breast cancers.
To investigate how Akt regulates metabolism in breast cancer, we evaluated metabolic 
reprogramming induced by an oncogenic Akt mutation identified in breast cancer patients: 
the E17K mutation, found in both AKT1 and AKT25,6. We stably expressed wild-type 
AKT1/2 or AKT1/2(E17K) in non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial MCF10A cells in a 
doxycycline-inducible manner to assess acute metabolic changes that occur upon oncogenic 
Akt activation. As previously reported5,7,8, phosphorylation of Akt1(E17K) on S473 is only 
slightly elevated under serum-starved conditions and does not lead to increased 
phosphorylation of Akt substrates such as PRAS40 and GSK-3 (Figure 1a). By contrast, 
Akt2(E17K) is robustly constitutively active, as evidenced by high basal S473 
phosphorylation, enhanced phosphorylation of downstream substrates, and increased in vitro 
kinase activity (Figure 1a and Supplementary Figure 1a). Although AKT1/2(E17K) does not 
enhance proliferation in the presence of growth factors (Supplementary Figure 1b), as 
reported7,8, only MCF10A AKT2(E17K) cells proliferate in a growth factor-independent 
manner (Figure 1b), demonstrating a functional consequence of constitutive Akt2(E17K) 
activity. Together, these results indicate that AKT2(E17K) is a more potent oncogenic 
mutation than AKT1(E17K).
Oncogenic signaling through Akt2(E17K) may support enhanced growth factor-independent 
proliferation by reprogramming cellular metabolism. To test this idea, we used targeted 
liquid chromatography-based tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) via selected reaction 
monitoring (SRM)9 to profile steady-state metabolite changes between serum-starved 
MCF10A AKT2 versus AKT2(E17K) cells and found significant differences between the 
two cell lines (Supplementary Figure 2a). Consistent with Akt-mediated regulation of 
glycolysis, Akt2(E17K) strongly up-regulates glycolytic intermediates, including the most 
up-regulated metabolite NADH (Supplementary Figure 2b–c). Interestingly, the second 
highest metabolite up-regulated by Akt2(E17K) is reduced glutathione (GSH), while levels 
of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) are unchanged, resulting in an increased GSH/GSSG ratio 
(Figure 1c).
Elevated GSH levels suggest that Akt2(E17K) controls cellular redox status by increasing 
the reducing potential of MCF10A cells, a conclusion supported by changes in levels of 
other metabolites. First, Akt2(E17K) selectively up-regulates metabolites in the oxidative 
pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), while metabolites exclusively in the non-oxidative PPP 
are unchanged or decreased (Supplementary Figure 2d). This is consistent with mTORC1 
activation downstream of Akt that selectively up-regulates the oxidative PPP10. Importantly, 
the oxidative PPP generates reducing equivalents in the form of NADPH, which can be used 
to reduce GSSG to GSH (Figure 1d). To further support a change in redox status, the most 
down-regulated metabolite in MCF10A AKT2(E17K) cells is cystine, the oxidized form of 
cysteine taken up from growth media (Figure 1c). This is consistent with a more reducing 
intracellular environment wherein any cystine taken up is rapidly reduced to cysteine. 
Interestingly, steady-state cysteine levels do not change (Figure 1c), suggesting that flux

 through metabolic processes that utilize cysteine, such as GSH biosynthesis (Figure 1d), 
may be increased by Akt2(E17K) as well.
We next asked whether Akt2(E17K) increases flux through the GSH biosynthetic pathway. 
In this pathway (Figure 1d), glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL), which consists of two 
subunits GCLC and GCLM, first ligates glutamate and cysteine to form -glutamylcysteine ( -
GluCys). Glutathione synthetase (GSS) then catalyzes the condensation of -GluCys with 
glycine to form GSH. GSH is also formed from the reduction of GSSG by glutathione 
reductase (GSR). The three amino acids that constitute GSH are primarily derived from 
metabolites in growth media: glycine and cysteine are taken up exogenously or synthesized 
from extracellular glucose and methionine, respectively, and glutamate is derived from 
extracellular glutamine. Therefore, to compare pathway flux, we used LC-MS/MS11,12 to 
demonstrate that the rate of incorporation of exogenous U-13C5-glutamine into -GluCys and 
GSH is increased in MCF10A AKT2(E17K) cells (Figure 1e). By contrast, the uptake of 
U-13C5-glutamine and its incorporation into GSSG is comparable between the two cell lines 
(Supplementary Figure 2e–f). Therefore, oncogenic signaling through Akt2(E17K) 
stimulates flux through the GSH biosynthetic pathway. Finally, using the NCI-60 
metabolomics data set (https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/NCIDTPdata/Molecular+Target
+Data), which profiles five breast cancer cell lines, we find that relative to two Ras mutant 
cell lines, three cell lines that harbor PI3K pathway mutations have higher levels of GSH 
(Figure 1f), suggesting a correlation between elevated GSH levels and PI3K pathway 
mutation status in breast cancer.
We next asked whether enhanced GSH biosynthesis mediated by oncogenic Akt signaling 
alters the intracellular redox status to increase resistance to oxidative stress. Compared to 
MCF10A AKT2 cells, apoptosis is suppressed in cells expressing AKT2(E17K) in response 
to H2O2, as demonstrated by reduced PARP cleavage (Figure 2a) and increased cell survival 
as measured by FACS (Supplementary Figure 3a). Resistance to oxidative stress is conferred 
by oncogenic Akt activity, since the Akt inhibitor GSK690693, which does not induce 
apoptosis on its own, sensitizes MCF10A AKT2(E17K) cells to H2O2 (Figure 2a, 
Supplementary Figure 3a,d). Similar results are observed in cells expressing oncogenic 
PIK3CA mutations (Figure 2b, Supplementary Figure 3b,e–f). Importantly, this oncogenic 
PI3K/Akt-driven resistance is dependent on enhanced GSH biosynthesis, since buthionine 
sulfoximine (BSO), a GCL inhibitor that reduces glutathione levels (Supplementary Figure 
3c), selectively sensitizes the mutant cells to H2O2 (Figure 2c–d, Supplementary Figure 3d–
f). Finally, the PI3K pathway mutant cells are also more resistant to two additional inducers 
of oxidative stress: tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBH), and LCS-1, a superoxide dismutase 1 
(SOD1) inhibitor that has been shown to inhibit the growth of breast cancer and lung 
adenocarcinoma cells by generating endogenous ROS13,14 (Figure 2e). Again, inhibition of 
either Akt or GSH biosynthesis sensitizes the mutant cells to these agents. Together, these 
data demonstrate that MCF10A cells harboring oncogenic PI3K pathway mutations are more 
resistant to oxidative stress, in part due to the stimulation of GSH biosynthesis by the 
PI3K/Akt pathway.
We determined that one mechanism by which Akt2(E17K) stimulates GSH biosynthesis is 
through the transcriptional up-regulation of the GSH biosynthetic genes GCLC, GCLM, and 
Lien et al.

 in particular GSS and GSR (Figure 3a). These genes are targets of the transcription factor 
Nrf2, which is the master regulator of the cellular antioxidant response15. Accordingly, 
NQO1, a canonical Nrf2 target, is also up-regulated by Akt2(E17K) (Figure 3a). In support 
of Nrf2 functioning downstream of Akt to stimulate GSH biosynthesis, knock-down of Nrf2 
reduces total cellular glutathione levels and sensitizes AKT2(E17K) cells to oxidative stress 
induced by H2O2 (Supplementary Figure 4a–c). Using a luciferase reporter under the control 
of the antioxidant response element (ARE), which is recognized by Nrf2, we show that 
Akt2(E17K) strongly activates Nrf2-mediated transcription, in a manner dependent on both 
Nrf2 and oncogenic Akt activity (Figure 3b, f).
Several mechanisms of Nrf2 activation in cancer have been reported16. In the context of 
oncogene-dependent signaling, mutations in oncogenes such as KRAS and BRAF activate 
Nrf2 by transcriptional up-regulation17. In MCF10A AKT2(E17K) cells, however, Nrf2 
transcript levels do not change relative to wild-type cells (Figure 3a), suggesting Nrf2 
activation through a post-transcriptional mechanism. Under basal conditions, the Keap1-
Cul3 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex suppresses Nrf2 by ubiquitin-directed proteasomal 
degradation. Various oxidative cellular stresses disrupt Nrf2 ubiquitination by Keap1-Cul3, 
resulting in Nrf2 stabilization and activation15. Accordingly, by using cycloheximide (CHX), 
we find that Nrf2 is stabilized in MCF10A AKT2(E17K) cells (Figure 3c), indicating that 
oncogenic Akt signaling activates Nrf2 through stabilization of the Nrf2 protein.
We noted that two Akt substrates are known to regulate Nrf2 protein stability. First, 
p21Cip1/WAF1 has been reported to directly bind Nrf2 and disrupt the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction 
to induce Nrf2 activation18. Consistent with Akt-mediated enhancement of p21 stability19, 
we find that MCF10A AKT2(E17K) cells express higher levels of p21, in a manner 
dependent on Akt activity, while levels of p27Kip1, another cyclin-dependent kinase 
inhibitor, are unaffected (Figure 3d). Importantly, p21 is required for the induction of Nrf2 
activity by Akt2(E17K) (Figure 3e). Another Akt substrate, GSK-3 , has been shown to 
phosphorylate and direct Nrf2 toward ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation after it is 
released from inhibition by Keap120. We therefore reasoned that Akt may activate Nrf2 
through inhibition of GSK-3 . Indeed, GSK690693-mediated inhibition of Akt2(E17K)-
induced Nrf2 activity is dependent on GSK-3 , since concomitant inhibition of Akt and 
GSK-3 with GSK690693 and SB415286, respectively, restores Nrf2 activity (Figure 3f). 
Therefore, GSK-3 is epistatic to and acts downstream of Akt with respect to Nrf2 activation. 
Based on these results, we propose that oncogenic PI3K/Akt signaling results in p21 
accumulation, which disrupts the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction. Nrf2 stability is then further 
enhanced by Akt-mediated inhibition of GSK-3 , leading to Nrf2 activation and up-
regulation of the GSH biosynthetic genes.
Finally, since these results largely rely on the MCF10A system, we asked whether Nrf2 
activation by oncogenic PI3K/Akt signaling functions in human breast tumors. We analyzed 
TCGA Invasive Breast Cancer (BRCA) microarray data21 by stratifying patient tumors 
according to mutation status: tumors harboring PIK3CA, PTEN, or AKT1 mutations were 
compared to ‘‘wild-type’’ tumors without these mutations. Analysis of several Nrf2 target 
genes indicates that many of these, and especially GSS and GSR, are up-regulated in PI3K 
pathway mutant tumors (Figure 3g), which closely reflects the qRT-PCR data from the

 MCF10A AKT2(E17K) cells (Figure 3a). Similarly, up-regulation of Nrf2 target genes is 
associated with tumors with high Akt S473 phosphorylation, as determined by TCGA 
reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) data (Figure 3h, Supplementary Figure 4d). Moreover, 
tumors with high Akt pS473 have elevated GSK-3 phosphorylation and p21 protein levels, 
consistent with our proposed mechanism of Nrf2 activation by oncogenic Akt signaling.
Next, we explored whether GSH biosynthesis is a metabolic vulnerability associated with 
PI3K/Akt-driven breast cancer progression. Recent studies demonstrated that in RAS mutant 
cancer cell lines, glutathione depletion by BSO or by inhibitors of the cystine-glutamate 
antiporter SLC7A11 leads to the inhibition of the glutathione peroxidase GPX4, 
subsequently inducing a form of cell death termed ferroptosis22,23. However, in MCF10A 
cells expressing AKT2(E17K), we do not observe an increase in SLC7A11 or GPX4 
expression (Supplementary Figure 5a). Consistently, in 2D culture conditions, rather than 
causing a loss in viability, BSO enhances the growth factor-independent proliferation of 
MCF10A AKT2(E17K) cells (Supplementary Figure 5b). Similarly, PIK3CA mutant cells 
are unaffected by BSO (Supplementary Figure 5c). In full growth media, low BSO 
concentrations stimulate proliferation, and growth inhibition is not observed until ~1 mM 
BSO, at which off-target effects are expected (Supplementary Fig. 5d–e). This is consistent 
with observations that low BSO concentrations may stimulate proliferation in certain 
contexts24, perhaps due to the induction of milder levels of oxidative stress that stimulate 
proliferative signaling25,26.
Since certain phenotypes differ in cells grown in 3D culture27, which more accurately 
recapitulates the morphology of tumors growing in vivo, we evaluated how BSO affects 
proliferation in 3D (Figure 4a). The number and morphology of spheroids formed by cells 
expressing empty vector control, wild-type PIK3CA, or wild-type AKT2 are only slightly 
affected by BSO. By contrast, the number of spheroids formed by cells expressing 
oncogenic PIK3CA or AKT2(E17K) is markedly reduced by BSO treatment, and spheroids 
that do grow are smaller and do not form multi-acinar structures observed in untreated cells. 
Therefore, in contrast to 2D culture, under 3D culture conditions that model both tumor 
initiation and maintenance we find that BSO selectively prevents tumor spheroid initiation 
by PIK3CA or AKT2 mutant MCF10A cells. This is consistent with the recent finding that 
inhibition of GSH biosynthesis in a mouse model by GCLM knockout markedly inhibits 
breast tumor initiation induced by the polyomavirus middle T oncogene, but has minimal 
effect on tumor maintenance28.
We also assessed whether enhanced GSH biosynthesis is required for mutant cells to resist 
anoikis and undergo anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. Although AKT2(E17K), 
like AKT1(E17K), does not drive colony formation7, PIK3CA mutant cells form colonies in 
a manner sensitive to BSO treatment (Figure 4b). Therefore, enhanced GSH biosynthesis is 
necessary, but not sufficient, for anchorage-independent growth. Since cells experience 
increased levels of oxidative stress when detached from their matrix29, stimulation of GSH 
production by oncogenic PI3K/Akt signaling is necessary for PIK3CA mutant cells to 
overcome this elevated oxidative stress and undergo anchorage-independent growth.

 Finally, since BSO sensitizes PIK3CA and AKT2 mutant cells to oxidative stress (Figure 2), 
we hypothesized that targeting GSH biosynthesis in combination with agents that induce 
oxidative stress, such as chemotherapy or radiation, may be a viable therapeutic strategy for 
treating breast cancer cells harboring a PI3K pathway mutation. In particular, oxidative 
stress is a major mechanism involved in cisplatin (CDDP) toxicity30. Moreover, elevated 
GSH levels have been associated with CDDP resistance, and GSH has been suggested to 
form a conjugate with CDDP to facilitate its export and elimination from cells31. Therefore, 
we reasoned that BSO would sensitize PI3K pathway mutant breast cancer cells to CDDP. 
We identified three breast cancer cell lines that are resistant to CDDP as a single agent in 
vitro (Figure 5a). BSO potently synergizes with CDDP to induce cell death in T47D and 
ZR-75-1 cells, which harbor a PIK3CA and PTEN mutation, respectively. Importantly, this 
cell death is partially rescued by EUK-134, a hydrogen peroxide scavenger, and is fully 
rescued by the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), indicating that the synergistic effect is 
mediated by GSH depletion. In contrast, MDA-MB-231 cells, which lack a PI3K pathway 
mutation, are insensitive to this combination. These results were corroborated in vivo: While 
BSO and CDDP only inhibit the growth of T47D xenografts in nude mice as single agents, 
CDDP induces T47D tumor regression in mice that have been pre-treated with BSO for a 
week (Figure 5b). By contrast, tumor regression is not induced by the combination in MDA-
MB-231 xenografts (Figure 5c), further suggesting a PI3K/Akt pathway-dependent effect of 
this drug combination. Given the renewed interest in using platinum-based agents for breast 
cancer treatment32, these results provide insight for inhibiting GSH biosynthesis to 
maximize the efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapies specifically for the treatment of 
breast tumors harboring a PI3K pathway mutation.
Taken together, our results show that the stimulation of GSH biosynthesis by Nrf2 activation 
constitutes a part of the metabolic reprogramming mediated by oncogenic PI3K/Akt 
signaling in breast cancer. By integrating analyses from a mammary epithelial cell line 
model, a panel of breast cancer cell lines, tumor xenografts, and TCGA breast cancer data, 
we provide pre-clinical evidence that may inform future therapeutic approaches for treating 
PI3K pathway mutant breast cancer cells by exploiting GSH biosynthesis as a metabolic 
vulnerability.

Plasmids
The AKT1(E17K) and AKT2(E17K) mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis 
(Qiagen) from pcDNA3-HA-AKT1 and pcDNA3-HA-AKT2 (Addgene). For doxycycline-
inducible overexpression of AKT1/2 and AKT1/2(E17K), pTRIPZ-HA-AKT1, pTRIPZ-
HA-AKT2, pTRIPZ-HA-AKT1(E17K), and pTRIPZ-HA-AKT2(E17K) were constructed. 
HA-AKT1/2 and HA-AKT1/2(E17K) cDNA were amplified by PCR, digested with the 
restriction enzymes AgeI and ClaI, and inserted into the pTRIPZ lentiviral vector (Thermo 
Scientific). Expression of each Akt variant was induced by treatment of cells with 150 ng/ml 
doxycycline for 48 h. pJP1520-HA-GFP, pJP1520-HA-PIK3CA WT, pJP1520-HA-
PIK3CA(E545K), and pJP1520-HA-PIK3CA(H1047R) were generous gifts from Dr. Albert 
S. Baldwin33. pDONR221-p21 was obtained from the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center 
DNA Resource Core, and p21 was sub-cloned into the pHAGE-C-HA-FLAG lentiviral 
expression vector (W. Harper, Harvard Medical School). The shRNA-resistant pHAGE-C-
HA-FLAG-p21 was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Qiagen).
RNA Interference
Validated shRNA hairpins targeting NRF2 were obtained from Sigma Mission shRNA- 
shNRF2 #1: TRCN0000007555; shNRF2 #2: TRCN0000007558. The tet-on p21 shRNA 
sequence has been previously described and validated27. Cells expressing shRNA were 
cultured in medium containing puromycin (0.5---2 μg/mL). Gene knock-down was induced 
by incubating cells with 150 ng/mL doxycycline for 48 to 72 hours.
Immunoblotting
Cells were washed with PBS at 4°C and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (1% 
NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 50 mmol/L Tris---HCl

pyrophosphate, and 20 mmol/L sodium fluoride) for 15 minutes at 4°C. Cell extracts were 
pre-cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C, and protein concentration 
was measured with the Bio-Rad DC protein assay. Lysates were then resolved on acrylamide 
gels by SDS---PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-
Rad) at 100 V for 90 minutes. The blots were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBST) buffer 
(10 mmol/L Tris---HCl, pH 8, 150 mmol/L NaCl, and 0.2% Tween 20) containing 5% (w/v) 
nonfat dry milk for 1 hour, and then incubated with the specific primary antibody diluted in 
blocking buffer at 4°C overnight. Membranes were washed three times in TBST and 
incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature. 
Membranes were washed three times and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence 
substrate (EMD Millipore).
In Vitro Protein Kinase Assays
MCF10A cells expressing empty vector, HA-AKT1/2, or HA-AKT1/2(E17K) were serum 
starved for 16 hours and lysed as described above in EBC buffer (0.5% NP-40, 120 mmol/L 
NaCl, 2 mmol/L EDTA, 2 mmol/L EGTA, 50 mmol/L Tris---HCl (pH 7.4), proteinase 
inhibitor cocktail, 50 nmol/L calyculin, 1 mmol/L sodium pyrophosphate, and 20 mmol/L 
sodium fluoride). HA-AKT1/2 or HA-AKT1/2(E17K) were immunoprecipitated from cell 
extracts with an anti-HA antibody and incubated with 300 ng GSK-3 fusion protein peptide 
(Cell Signaling Technology) in the presence of 150 mmol/L cold ATP in a kinase buffer 
(Cell Signaling Technology) for 40 min at 30°C. The kinase reaction was terminated by the 
addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer.
Proliferation Assays
For WST-1 assays, MCF10A cells were seeded into 96-well plates (Corning) at a density of 
1500 cells per well in 100 μL medium. The medium was changed to either regular growth 
medium or serum-free medium after 16 h. Cell viability was measured at the indicated time 
points after the media change using the water soluble tetrazolium salt WST-1 assay 
(Clontech) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
For sulforhodamine B (SRB) assays, MCF10A cells were seeded into 12-well plates 
(Corning) at a density of 5 x 104 cells per well in 1 mL medium. The medium was changed 
to either regular growth medium or serum-free medium every two days. Cell number was 
measured at the indicated time points using sulforhodamine B staining, as previously 
described34.
LC-MS/MS Metabolomic Profiling
Cells were maintained in the indicated growth media, and fresh media was added 3 h before 
the experiment. For metabolite extraction, media from biological triplicates was aspirated, 
and 80% (v/v) methanol at dry ice temperatures was added. Cells and the metabolite-
containing supernatants were collected, and the insoluble material in lysates was centrifuged 
at 4,000xg for 5 min. The resulting supernatant was evaporated using a refrigerated 
SpeedVac. Samples were re-suspended using 20 μl HPLC grade water for mass 
spectrometry. Ten microliters were injected and analyzed using a 5500 QTRAP hybrid triple

soluble metabolites for steady-state analyses of samples. Some metabolites were targeted in 
both positive and negative ion mode for a total of 285 SRM transitions using positive/
negative switching. ESI voltage was +4900 V in positive ion mode and ---4500 V in negative 
ion mode. The dwell time was 4 ms per SRM transition and the total cycle time was 1.89 s. 
Approximately 9---12 data points were acquired per detected metabolite. Samples were 
delivered to the MS via normal phase chromatography using a 4.6 mm i.d x 10 cm Amide 
Xbridge HILIC column (Waters Corp.) at 300 μl/min. Gradients were run starting from 85% 
buffer B (HPLC grade acetonitrile) to 42% B from 0–5 min; 42% B to 0% B from 5---16 
min; 0% B was held from 16---24 min; 0% B to 85% B from 24---25 min; 85% B was held 
for 7 min to re-equilibrate the column. Buffer A was comprised of 20 mM ammonium 
hydroxide/20 mM ammonium acetate (pH = 9.0) in water:acetonitrile (95:5). Peak areas 
from the total ion current for each metabolite SRM transition were integrated using 
MultiQuant v2.0 software (AB/SCIEX). For 13C-labeled experiments, SRMs were created 
for expected 13C incorporation in various forms for targeted LC-MS/MS. Data analysis was 
performed in MatLab. For steady-state profiling, metabolite peak area intensities represent 
the normalized (by the average of cell number and cellular protein content), integrated total 
ion current from a single SRM transition and are expressed as relative values across all 
samples. For flux analyses, metabolite abundances represent the normalized (by cell 
number), integrated total ion current from a single SRM transition.
Isotope Labeling
DMEM lacking glucose, glutamine, and pyruvate (CellGro) was supplemented with 10 mM 
glucose and 2 mM U-13C5-glutamine (Cambridge Isotope Labs). Labeled media was added 
to the cells, and cellular metabolites were extracted as described above at 1, 3, and 8 h.
IGF-1, Hydrogen Peroxide, and Tert-Butyl Hydroperoxide Treatments
For IGF-1 stimulation, cells were serum-starved for 20–24 h and stimulated with 100 μg/ml 
IGF-1 (R&D Systems) for 10 min. For H2O2 and tert-butyl hydroperoxide treatments, cells 
were serum-starved for 20–24 h in DMEM lacking pyruvate and then stimulated with the 
indicated concentrations of H2O2 (Fisher) or tert-butyl hydroperoxide (Sigma-Aldrich) in 
Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Gibco).
Cell Death Assay
Cells were trypsinized at 37°C, followed by staining with 7-AAD (BD Pharmingen). Briefly, 
cells were washed twice with PBS and stained with 5 μL 7-AAD in binding buffer for 15 
minutes. FACS analysis was performed with FACSCalibur (Becton-Dickinson) and FlowJo 
(TreeStar Inc.) software.
Propidium Iodide Viability Assay
Cell viability was assayed with a propidium iodide-based plate reader assay, as previously 
described35. Briefly, cells in 96-well plates were treated with a final concentration of 30 μM 
propidium iodide for 60 min at 37° C. The initial fluorescence intensity was measured in a

 SpectraMax M5 (Molecular Devices) at 530 nm excitation/620 nm emission. Digitonin was 
then added to each well at a final concentration of 600 μM. After incubating for 30 min at 
37° C, the final fluorescence intensity was measured. The fraction of dead cells was 
calculated by dividing the background-corrected initial fluorescence intensity by the final 
fluorescence intensity. Viability was calculated by (1 --- fraction of dead cells).
Total Glutathione Measurements
Cellular metabolites were collected by methanol extraction and concentrated by SpeedVac 
evaporation, as described above. Total glutathione levels within these samples were 
measured according to the manufacturer’s protocol by using the Glutathione Assay Kit from 
Cayman Chemical, which is based on the Tietze method36.
Quantitative Real-Time PCR
Total RNA was isolated with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s 
protocol. Reverse transcription was performed using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription 
Kit (Qiagen). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using an ABI Prism 7700 sequence 
detector. GCLC primer: sense, 5’-TTGATCATCTCCTGGCCCAG-3’, antisense, 5’-

PCR reactions were carried out in triplicate. Quantification of mRNA expression was 
calculated by the CT method with 18S rRNA as the reference gene.
ARE-luciferase Assay
Luciferase assays were conducted using Promega’s luciferase assay system, as previously 
described37. Luciferase activity was normalized by cellular protein content. The lentiviral 
ARE-luciferase reporter plasmid (Qiagen) was a generous gift from Dr. Gina M. DeNicola.
TCGA Data Analysis
Mutation, copy number analysis, microarray, and RPPA data from the published TCGA 
Invasive Breast Cancer data set21 was downloaded from cBioPortal. Analysis of the data was 
conducted in MatLab.
3D Cultures
3D cultures were prepared as previously described38. Briefly, chamber slides were coated 
with growth factor---reduced, phenol-free Matrigel (Corning) and allowed to solidify for 30

 minutes. Cells (2,000–4,000) in assay medium were seeded on coated chamber slides. Assay 
medium contained DMEM/Ham’s F12 supplemented with 5% equine serum (Gibco), 10 
mg/mL insulin (Life Technologies), 500 ng/mL hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich), 5 ng/mL 
EGF (R&D Systems), and 100 ng/mL cholera toxin (Sigma-Aldrich). The assay medium 
was replaced every 4 days. Doxycycline (150 ng/mL) was added every 2 or 3 days. The 
indicated concentrations of BSO (Sigma-Aldrich) were added one day after seeding and re-
added every 2 or 3 days.
Soft Agar Assays
Cells (4 x 104) were added to 1 ml of growth media plus 0.4% noble agar (BD Biosciences), 
with or without BSO (Sigma-Aldrich). The resulting mixture was layered onto a 2 ml bed of 
growth media plus 0.8% noble agar in 6-well plates (Corning), with or without BSO. Cells 
were fed every 3–6 days with 0.5 ml of growth media (± BSO). After four weeks, the growth 
media was removed, and viable colonies were stained with iodonitrotetrazolium chloride 
(Sigma-Aldrich). Colony number was determined using MatLab.
In Vitro Combination Assays
MDA-MB-231, T47D, and ZR-75-1 cells were seeded at a density of 10000, 13000, and 
10000 cells per well, respectively, in 96-well plates (Corning). Cells were treated with 50 
μM BSO (Sigma-Aldrich) for 48 h, followed by treatment with cisplatin (Tocris) at a range 
of concentrations for 48 h, in the presence or absence of 50 μM EUK-134 or 1 mM N-acetyl 
cysteine (NAC). Cell viability was measured using a propidium iodide-based plate reader 
assay.
Xenograft Studies
Female nude mice (5–6 weeks old) were purchased from Taconic and maintained and treated 
under specific pathogen-free conditions. All procedures were approved by the Institutional 
Animal Care and Use Committee at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC; 
Boston, MA) and conform to the federal guidelines for the care and maintenance of 
laboratory animals. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. These 
experiments were not randomized, and the investigators were not blinded to allocation 
during experiments and outcome assessment. The mice were injected subcutaneously with 5 
x 106 T47D cells (n = 20 mice) or 2.5 x 106 MDA-MB-231 cells (n = 20 mice) in media 
with 50% growth factor-reduced, phenol red-free Matrigel (Corning). For mice bearing 
T47D xenografts, 17 -estradiol was administered daily using a validated peroral method39. 
Tumor formation was examined every 2 to 3 days for the duration of the experiment. When 
tumors reached a size of 5–6 mm in diameter, they were divided into a control group and 
treatment groups of BSO alone, cisplatin (CDDP) alone, and BSO in combination with 
CDDP (at least n = 4 per group). L-S,R-BSO (Fisher) was administered using a validated 
continuous oral delivery method28,40 in drinking water at a concentration of 20 mM. CDDP 
(Tocris) was administered by I.P. injection at 5 mg/kg/week. For the combination treatment 
group, mice were pre-treated with BSO for 7 days before treatment with CDDP. Tumor 
volume = ( /6)(W2)(L); W = width, L = length.

(CDDP) for 48 h, in the presence or absence of 50 μM EUK-134 or 1 mM N-acetyl cysteine 
(NAC). Cell viability was measured using a propidium iodide-based plate reader assay (n = 
3 biologically independent replicates (Supplementary Table 1)). b, c, T47D (b) or MDA-
MB-231 (c) xenografts were grown in nude mice treated with vehicle (T47D: n = 5, MDA-
MB-231: n = 5), BSO (T47D: n = 4, MDA-MB-231: n = 4), CDDP (T47D: n = 4, MDA-
MB-231: n = 4), or a combination of one week of BSO pre-treatment followed by CDDP 
(T47D: n = 5, MDA-MB-231: n = 7) (n represents number of biologically independent 
tumors (Supplementary Table 1)). All error bars represent s.e.m. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P < 
0.001 by a two-sided Student’s t-test.
