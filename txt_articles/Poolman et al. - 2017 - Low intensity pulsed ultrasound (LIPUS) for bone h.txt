This BMJ Rapid Recommendations 
article is one of a series that 
provides clinicians with trustworthy 
recommendations for potentially 
practice changing evidence. 
BMJ Rapid Recommendations 
represent a collaborative effort 
between the MAGIC group (www.
magicproject.org) and The 
BMJ. A summary is offered here 
and the full version including 
decision aids is on the MAGICapp 
(www.magicapp.org), for all 
devices in multilayered formats. 
Those reading and using these 
recommendations should consider 
individual patient circumstances 
and their values and preferences 
and may want to use consultation 
decision aids in MAGICapp to 
facilitate shared decision making 
with patients. We encourage 
adaptation of recommendations 
to allow contextualisation of

Does low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) acceler-
ate recovery in adults and children who have expe-
rienced bone fractures or osteotomy (cutting of a 
bone)? An expert panel rapidly produced these rec-
ommendations based on a linked systematic review 
triggered by a large multi-centre randomised trial in 
adults with tibial fracture.
Fracture is common (see box on p 3). Bones can also be 
broken for medical reasons; osteotomy is a procedure 
whereby a bone is cut to shorten, lengthen, or to change 
its alignment. Following osteotomy, the bone has similar 
healing problems as traumatic fractures, and may require 
more extensive r 
ecovery.1
Irrespective of age, location, and mechanism of the 
broken bone, whether it is managed with or without sur-
gery, and whether it heals as expected or with delay, the 
idea of speeding or enhancing this healing to minimise 
symptoms and inconvenience for the patient is appealing. 
Bone stimulators such as LIPUS and electromagnetic field 
therapy might promote bone healing by stimulating bone 
growth (osteogenesis) in long or other bones.
Guidance from independent organisations on use of 
LIPUS for bone healing is scarce, but data suggest the 
device is commonly used in clinical practice (see box on 
p 3). Prices vary across countries, each device costing 
between US$1300 and $5000 (based on US and UK).
The TRUST randomised controlled trial published in 
The BMJ on 25 October 2016 found that the addition of 
LIPUS to standard care in 501 adult patients undergoing 
surgery for fresh tibial fracture did not improve functional 
recovery or accelerate radiographic healing at one year 
follow up compared with a sham device.9 The BMJ Rapid 
Recommendations team believed that the TRUST trial, if 
considered in a new systematic review and meta-analysis,

RAPID RECOMMENDATIONS
The evidence
Evidence requested from the panel to inform recommen-
dations:
•   
A new rapid systematic review of the effects of LIPUS 
added to standard care for a variety of fractures and 
osteotomies16
•   
A systematic literature search on patients’ values 
and preferences, which did not identify any relevant 
studies (see appendix 4 on bmj.com).
Systematic review of LIPUS for all fracture healing
The data from the TRUST trial9 were included in a linked 
systematic review of randomised trials of LIPUS com-
pared with sham device or no device on patient-important 
outcomes in patients with a fracture or osteotomy. Fig 
1 shows details about the trials and characteristics of 
included patients.16
We judged that the systematic review provides evidence 
of moderate to high certainty that LIPUS has little or no 
impact on time to return to work, time to full weight bear-
ing, pain, the number of subsequent operations, or time 
to radiographic healing (see infographic on p 2). We were 
confident that there was little risk of adverse events from 
the device, based on nine trials that reported this outcome.
For return to work, time to full weight bearing, and 
number of subsequent operations, our certainty in the 
evidence is moderate (rather than high) because of 
imprecise estimates of effect, where confidence intervals 
Background information
Bone fracture
• More than one in three people have a fracture at some 
point in their life
• Each year around four per 100 people of all ages experience 
a fracture2
• Some 5-10% of these experience delayed healing or non-
union of the fracture3
LIPUS
• Guidance
 
– 1994 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 
LIPUS for fracture healing and, in 2000, for treatment of 
established non-unions4
 
– 2010 UK National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence (NICE) issued a statement supporting the 
use of LIPUS to reduce fracture healing time and to 
provide clinical benefit, particularly in circumstances of 
delayed healing and non-union5
• Data on use
 
– A Canadian survey of 450 trauma surgeons in 2008 
found that nearly half of respondents were using bone 
stimulators to manage tibial fractures. Of those, about 
half used electro-magnetic field therapy and the other 
half used LIPUS6
 
– Global revenues for bone stimulators were about 
US$400m 2004.7 In 2007, sales from LIPUS were 
around $250m in the US8
 
– We found no data to describe whether use has changed 
over time

RAPID RECOMMENDATIONS
A particular challenge for the panel was to determine 
to what extent the most trustworthy evidence—coming 
from trials of patients with fresh tibial and clavicle frac-
tures managed operatively—could be applied to adults 
with different types of fracture or osteotomies. Trials 
including patients with stress fractures, non-union, 
and osteotomies were either at high risk of bias or did 
not contribute sufficient outcome data to the systematic 
review. After extensive deliberations, the panel found 
no compelling anatomical or physiological reasons 
why LIPUS would probably be beneficial in these other 
included potentially important benefit and harm (see 
forest plots (figs 2-7) in the linked systematic review).16 
The observed heterogeneity in the effect sizes between 
trials for time to weight bearing, pain, and radiographic 
healing was explained by considering risk of bias: stud-
ies with serious methodological limitations due to lack 
of blinding (no use of sham device) suggested a benefit, 
whereas studies without such limitations did not (see 
subgroup analyses in the linked systematic review).16 
For these outcomes, we therefore based our conclusions 
on the trials with low risk of bias. The estimates for typi-
cal (prognostic) outcomes for patients not treated with 
LIPUS were informed by the control arm of the TRUST 
trial, which enrolled patients with tibia fractures in the 
US and Canada and was at low risk of bias.
Understanding the recommendation
We unanimously agreed to issue a strong recommenda-
tion against LIPUS for patients with any bone fractures or 
osteotomy. We have moderate to high certainty of a lack 
of benefit for outcomes important to patients, and, com-
bined with the high costs of treatment, LIPUS represents 
an inefficient use of limited healthcare resources.
Fig 2 |  Practical issues about use of LIPUS
HOW THE RECOMMENDATION WAS CREATED
Our international guideline panel included orthopaedic 
and musculoskeletal trauma surgeons, physiotherapists, 
general internists, methodologists, and people with 
lived experience of bone fractures including one who 
used LIPUS (see appendix 1 on bmj.com for list of panel 
members). No person had financial conflicts of interest; 
intellectual and professional conflicts were minimised 
and managed according to BMJ Rapid Recommendations 
standards (see appendices 2 and 3 on bmj.com).
We followed the BMJ Rapid Recommendations 
procedures for creating a trustworthy 
recommendation.12 13 We discussed and agreed on the 
clinical outcomes of most importance to patients and 
clinicians a priori, and the systematic review authors 
focused their reporting on these. The outcomes chosen for 
LIPUS were:
• Functional recovery (such as time to return to work and 
time to full weight bearing)
• Pain
• Subsequent operations
• Complications.
The patient representatives judged radiographic healing 
as a less important outcome. It was included because 
many clinicians would consider radiographic healing 
to inform their management decisions. Some patients 
may feel reassured by observing radiographic healing, 
with increased confidence in resuming activities such as 
weight bearing and return to work.
Before seeing the evidence, we agreed on what would 
constitute an important benefit from using LIPUS for 
these outcomes, and how patient values and preferences 
might vary between persons. Guided by patients on our 
panel, we agreed that most people want at least a possibly 
important benefit in functional recovery time or pain to 
make the time and expense of using LIPUS worthwhile. 
Reduced adherence with the device in the TRUST trial 
suggests that LIPUS can be burdensome to patients.9
We applied the GRADE system to critically appraise the 
evidence and move from evidence to recommendations 
(appendix 3).14 We considered the balance of benefits, 
harms, and burdens of the procedure; the quality of 
evidence for each outcome; the typical and expected 
variation in patient values and preferences; resources; 
feasibility; and acceptability—details of our reasoning 
are summarised in the infographic and discussed further 
in the text.15 Recommendations can be strong or weak, 
for or against a course of action. We place a low value on 
speculative benefits of treatments. Thus, when available 
evidence suggests no benefit, or only very low quality 
evidence suggests benefit and moderate or high quality 
evidence shows appreciable adverse effects, burden, or 
cost, the panel would make a strong recommendation 
against an intervention.

RAPID RECOMMENDATIONS
Future research
It is unlikely that new trials will alter the evidence. 
Fracture research should focus on other interventions 
that have a greater probability to speed up healing, 
such as surgical application of adjuvant biomaterials 
or extracorporeal shock wave therapy.22 23 Further trials 
of treatments for non-union fractures would be better 
compared with operative stabilisation, with or without 
autologous bone grafts. Research should also address 
de-implementation strategies for the use of LIPUS for 
bone healing.24
Competing interests: All authors have completed the BMJ Rapid 
Recommendations interests form. The BMJ Rapid Recommendations 
team judged that no panel member declared financial, professional, or 
academic interests that precluded authorship. The declared interests for 
each panel member are in appendix 2 on bmj.com. No panel members 
declared any financial conflicts of interest related to this clinical question, 
specifically no financial ties to the bone stimulators industry. B Mollon 
uses bone stimulators in practice. T Agoritsas, RAC Siemieniuk, B Mollon, 
S Schandelmaier, L Lytvyn, and PO Vandvik participated in writing the 
complementary systematic reviews that formed the evidence base for this 
guideline. B Mollon was a co-author on a systematic review on this topic 
published in The BMJ in 2009, for which R Poolman wrote the editorial. No 
other panel member has previously formally made statements regarding 
LIPUS. This article was edited by H MacDonald at The BMJ who had no 
relevant financial or intellectual interests.
Transparency: R Poolman affirms that the manuscript is an honest, 
accurate, and transparent account of the study being reported; that 
no important aspects of the study have been omitted; and that any 
discrepancies from the study as planned (and, if relevant, registered) have 
been explained.

patient populations. For example, if LIPUS on fresh frac-
tures does not decrease the incidence of non-unions, it 
is unlikely to exert a beneficial effect in the conversion 
of non-unions into healed bones. Furthermore, osteoto-
mies have the same biological response as for traumatic 
fractures. An additional challenge faced by the panel 
was that no trials included children. Paediatric fractures 
typically heal faster and have lower rates of non-union; 
thus, any potential benefit of LIPUS for children is likely 
to be even smaller than that for adults. The panel con-
cluded that the evidence was applicable to all of these 
groups, and did not downgrade their certainty in the 
evidence.20
In response to peer review comments, the panel again 
considered the applicability to other fractures and pop-
ulations, in particular non-union fractures. Reviewers 
pointed to differing healing methods in non-union, and 
the potential that smaller effect sizes could make a dif-
ference to patients. Non-union is the result of impaired 
bone health, as seen in smokers and diabetics,21 or due 
to mechanical reasons such as large bone defects. There 
was high quality evidence showing a lack of benefit in 
accelerating healing for fresh fractures, thus it is unlikely 
that LIPUS would improve outcomes in patients with 
non-union. Given the panel’s judgment of an implausible 
benefit of LIPUS for patients with non-union, the panel 
chose to make a strong recommendation against LIPUS 
also for these patients.
Practical considerations
Patients with fractures may experience pain and limited 
mobility, particularly in the first two to three months. 
Driving and physical activity are limited during the recov-
ery period. Figure 2 outlines the key practical issues for 
those considering LIPUS as an adjunct therapy in the 
management of bone fractures.
Costs and resources
LIPUS does not represent an efficient use of health 
resources for individuals or health funders, given its lack 
of benefit on outcomes important to patients and its pur-
chasing costs. Healthcare organisations that currently pay 
for LIPUS may reasonably choose to stop reimbursements 
based on best current evidence and our strong recom-
mendation against LIPUS.
HOW PATIENTS WERE INVOLVED IN THE CREATION 
OF THIS ARTICLE
Four people with lived experience of bone fractures, 
one of whom had used LIPUS, were full panel members, 
participated in the teleconferences and email discussions, 
and met all authorship criteria. These panel members 
identified important outcomes and led the discussions 
about values and preferences. Return to work or regular 
activities and pain were weighed as of higher importance for 
patients than radiographic healing. The panel identified key 
practical issues including concerns with cost and access to 
LIPUS, as well as the burden of therapy. In light of the lack 
of efficacy, one patient panel member remarked, and the 
others agreed, that discussing LIPUS would unnecessarily 
take valuable time from the patient-clinician encounter, 
which is often already too short.
