ABSTRACT
Aims
To estimate differences in the strength and shape of associations between alcohol use and diagnosis-specific sick-
ness absence. Design
A multi-cohort study. Participants (n = 47520) responded to a survey on alcohol use at two time-
points, and were linked to records of sickness absence. Diagnosis-specific sickness absence was followed for 4–7 years from
the latter survey. Setting and participants
From Finland, we had population cohort survey data from 1998 and 2003
and employee cohort survey data from 2000–02 and 2004. From France and the United Kingdom, we had employee co-
hort survey data from 1993 and 1997, and 1985–88 and 1991–94, respectively. Measurements
We used standard
questionnaires to assess alcohol intake categorized into 0, 1–11 and > 11 units per week in women and 0, 1–34 and
> 34 units per week in men. We identified groups with stable and changing alcohol use over time. We linked participants
to records from sickness absence registers. Diagnoses of sickness absence were coded according to the International Clas-
sification of Diseases. Estimates were adjusted for sex, age, socio-economic status, smoking and body mass index.
Findings
Women who reported drinking 1–11 units and men who reported drinking 1–34 units of alcohol per week
in both surveys were the reference group. Compared with them, women and men who reported no alcohol use in either
survey had a higher risk of sickness absence due to mental disorders [rate ratio = 1.51, 95% confidence interval
(CI) = 1.22–1.88], musculoskeletal disorders (1.22, 95% CI = 1.06–1.41), diseases of the digestive system (1.35, 95%
CI = 1.02–1.77) and diseases of the respiratory system (1.49, 95% CI = 1.29–1.72). Women who reported alcohol con-
sumption of > 11 weekly units and men who reported alcohol consumption of > 34 units per week in both surveys were at
increased risk of absence due to injury or poisoning (1.44, 95% CI = 1.13–1.83). Conclusions
In Finland, France and
the United Kingdom, people who report not drinking any alcohol on two occasions several years apart appear to have a
higher prevalence of sickness absence from work with chronic somatic and mental illness diagnoses than those drinking
below a risk threshold of 11 units per week for women and 34 units per week for men. Persistent at-risk drinking in
Finland, France and the United Kingdom appears to be related to increased absence due to injury or poisoning.

 INTRODUCTION
Previous studies have shown that both abstainers and at-
risk drinkers are at an increased risk of sickness absence
compared with low-risk drinkers [1–5]. As former at-risk
drinkers also have a higher risk of sickness absence than
low-risk drinkers [6], part of the excess sickness absence
in abstainers may be attributable to health selection, i.e.
at-risk drinkers may reduce their drinking due to health
problems, and thus the higher risk of sickness absence
among abstainers is due at least partly to prior alcohol use.
Differences in social insurance systems, policies for sick-
ness absence and cultural differences might affect the asso-
ciation between alcohol use and sickness absence [7–10].
To obtain generalizable, rather than particular evidence,
in our previous study we used data from three countries
(Finland, the United Kingdom and France), and demon-
strated a U-shaped association between alcohol use and
sickness absence among men [11]. In that study, both
men and women abstaining from alcohol for 4–6 years
had a higher risk of all-cause sickness absence compared
to those who had been moderate drinkers during the same
time. To date, however, it is still unclear which specific diag-
noses are associated with the excess risk of sickness ab-
sence among abstainers, and whether they correspond to
those observed among at-risk drinkers.
The first aim of the current study was to estimate differ-
ences in diagnosis-specific sickness absence diagnosis be-
tween abstainers, former, persistent and new at-risk and
low-risk drinkers. We focused on mental disorders, muscu-
loskeletal disorders, diseases of the circulatory system, di-
gestive disease and respiratory diseases, as well as
external causes, as these diagnostic groups have been
found
to
underlie
alcohol-related
sickness
absence
[12,13]. In addition, we studied whether the alcohol use–
sickness absence associations differed between men and
women.
METHODS
Design
In this prospective multi-cohort study, we used individual-
level data from four well-characterized cohort studies: (a)
a population-based sample of Finnish working-age adults
participating in the Health and Social Support (HeSSup)
study, Finland [14,15]; (b) the Whitehall II study of British
civil servants [16]; (c) the employees of the national gas
and electricity company participating in the GAZEL study,
France [17]; and (d) the municipal employees of the Finn-
ish Public Sector (FPS) study, Finland [1]. In all these stud-
ies, alcohol use was assessed twice, and diagnosis-specific
sickness absences were followed for 4–7 years after the lat-
ter survey via linkage to electronic health records. Ethical
approval was obtained from Turku University Central
Hospital Ethics committee for the HeSSup study, from the
University College London Medical School committee on
the ethics of human research for the Whitehall II study,
from the Inserm Ethics committee for GAZEL and from
the Ethics committee of the Hospital District of Helsinki
and Uusimaa for FPS.
From all four cohorts, we included respondents who
were alive, not retired before the start of the follow-up
and had data on all studied variables from the surveys that
were included in this study design. The eligible population
in each study comprised the respondents of a baseline and
follow-up questionnaire survey. In the HeSSup study, the
survey years were 1998 and 2003 (n = 10667), in the
GAZEL study 1993 and 1997 (n = 8107), in the Whitehall
II study phases 1 (1985–8) and 3 (1991–94) (n = 3730)
and in the FPS 2000–02 and 2004 (n = 25016). The attri-
tion rates between the two measurement points were ac-
ceptable: 24% were lost to follow-up in HeSSup, 7% in
GAZEL, 13% in Whitehall II and 34% in FPS.
The follow-up time (time at-risk for sickness absence) in
all studies was until disability or old-age pension, death or
end of follow-up, whichever came first. Time at-risk for
sickness absence was defined with person-years in the la-
bour force. In the Whitehall II cohort, we were able exclude
possible periods of unemployment, parental leave or other
transient episodes of not working from time at risk. In the
GAZEL, HeSSup and FPS cohorts we were unable to ex-
clude these episodes of not working.
Measurement of alcohol use
Alcohol use was assessed by questions on average weekly
consumption. One drink/alcohol unit was estimated as
12 g of alcohol (EUR unit) except in Whitehall, where a
unit was 8 g (UKunit). Alcohol intake was categorized into
‘no alcohol use’, ‘moderate use’ (a maximum of 140 g or
1–11 EUR units or 1–17 UK units for women and 280 g
or 1–23 EUR units or 1–34 UK units for men per week),
and ‘heavy use’ (> 140 g or > 11 EUR units or > 17 UK
units for women and > 280 g or > 23 EUR units or > 34
UKunits for men per week). The cut-points of at-risk drink-
ing were based on Finnish Current Care Guidelines [18].
Alcohol use was measured twice (two survey re-
sponses). Based on these two measurements, we classified
the respondents as ‘abstainers’ (no alcohol use in either
survey), ‘low-risk’ (moderate use reported in both surveys),
‘former at-risk’ (heavy use reported at baseline survey, but
no or moderate use in the follow-up survey), ‘persistent at-
risk’ (heavy use reported in both surveys) and ‘new at-risk’
(heavy use at follow-up survey only). Those who changed
between abstinence and moderate use between the two
time-points
were
omitted
from
the
study
(pooled
n = 4924, 10%). This was conducted to ensure the ‘clean-
liness’ reference group, i.e. low-risk drinkers. Changing

 between abstinence and moderate use could be a sign of
health problems intervening with our study design.
Classification of alcohol use was consistent with our
previous study [11].
Ascertainment of diagnosis-specific sickness absence
Sickness absence was measured as number of sickness ab-
sence days per follow-up year. In HeSSup and FPS, register
information on the dates of sickness absence exceeding
9 days was retrieved from the Social Insurance Institution
of Finland. These were followed-up from 1 January 2004 to
31 December 2010 in HeSSup and from 1 January 2005
to 31 December 2011 in FPS. In Whitehall II, information
on all days of sickness absence was from the Civil Service
(employer) records for those employees who gave consent
to monitor their sickness absence for a follow-up period
from phase 3 until the end of 1998. In GAZEL, the
information on annual days of sickness absence was
obtained from the employer’s records for a follow-up
period from 1 anuary 1998 to 31 December 2004.
Diagnoses of sickness absence were coded according to
International
Classification
of
Diseases
(ICD-10)
in
HeSSup, GAZEL and FPS. We used the following diagnosis
groups: codes F00-F99 for mental and behavioural disor-
der; I00–I99 for diseases of the circulatory system; J00–
J99 for diseases of the respiratory system; K00–K93 for dis-
eases of the digestive system; M00–M99 for diseases of the
musculoskeletal system and connective tissue; and S00–
T98 for injury, poisoning and certain other consequences
of external causes. In HeSSup and FPS, the data included
all absence episodes lasting for at least 10 days, from the
date that illness began (the first days of absence form work)
until the sickness absence benefit ended. In GAZEL, a med-
ical certificate is required from day 1, and the data included
all episodes of sickness absence irrespective of length. How-
ever, the cause of sickness absence was missing for 50% of
absences of fewer than 7 days, 17% of those of 8–28 days
and 3% of absences of more than 28 days [12].
In Whitehall II, a medical certificate was required for
absences longer than 7 calendar days. The coding was
based on ICD-8 classification, which was converted to a
smaller number of disease categories using the morbidity
coding system of the Royal College of General Practitioners
(RCGP), as described elsewhere in detail [19,20]. We used
codes 5 (psychoses), 40 (neurosis) and 41 (neurosis ill-
defined) to define sickness absence due to mental and be-
havioural disorder-related sickness absence; codes 9 (car-
diovascular diseases), 10 (cerebrovascular diseases) and
11 (peripheral vascular diseases) to define sickness absence
due to diseases of the circulatory system; code 12 (diseases
of the respiratory system); code 13 (diseases of the digestive
system); code 17 (diseases of the musculoskeletal system
and connective tissue); and code 23 (injury and poisoning).
Thus, our outcome measures best capture sickness absence
due to chronic long-term illness rather than transient/
short-term illness, such as respiratory infections, head-
aches or migraine.
Covariates
Covariates, measured at T2, were socio-economic status
(SES), age, sex, smoking and body mass index (BMI). SES
was based on occupational class except for HeSSup, where
information on occupational class was unavailable, and
SES was based on vocational education. In FPS and GAZEL,
SES was based on register data and in HeSSup and White-
hall, it was based on self-reports. High SES included admin-
istrators, managers, experts and specialists, and in HeSSup,
those with university/polytechnic education. Intermediate
SES included skilled non-manual occupations, such as of-
fice work, customer service, sales work and hospital nurses,
and in HeSSup, those with college-level education. Low
SES included manual workers, such as construction
workers, manufacturing, transportation (FPS, GAZEL),
clerical and office support work (in Whitehall II) and those
with vocational school, vocational course, apprenticeship
training or no vocational education (HeSSup).
Age was treated as a continuous variable in the analy-
ses, except for sickness absence due to musculoskeletal di-
agnoses, where we observed a curvilinear association
with age among women. There, we used age as categorized
into < 40, < 50 and ≥ 50 years. Smoking was self-reported
in all studies, and was dichotomized into current smoker or
non-smoker (including never and ex-smokers). BMI
(= weight in kg divided by height in m2) was self-reported
in HeSSup, GAZEL and FPS. In the Whitehall II study,
BMI was derived from measures taken at clinical examina-
tions. BMI was categorized as less than 18.5 (under-
weight), 18.5–25 (normal weight), 25–29 (overweight)
and 30 or more (obesity).
Statistical analysis
First, we used a two-step meta-analysis [21]. In the first
step, we performed study-specific analyses and used nega-
tive binomial regression analysis to examine the rate ratios
(RR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) of sickness
absence for no alcohol use, former at-risk drinking, persis-
tent at-risk drinking and new at-risk drinking compared to
persistent low-risk drinking. We adjusted for sex, age, SES,
smoking and BMI. The study-specific results were analysed
using SAS version 9.4. In the second step, study-specific
RR estimates were pooled in fixed-effects meta-analysis
with Stata version 14 software. We examined heterogene-
ity between the estimates using the I2 statistic. As a sensi-
tivity analysis, we pooled study specific estimates in
random-effects meta-analysis.

 As a supplementary analysis, we also performed a
single-step meta-analysis, where the data from the four co-
horts were pooled together and analysed with negative bi-
nomial regression analysis. Here, study cohort as well as
sex, age, SES, smoking and BMI were treated as fixed-
effects, i.e. covariates. Interaction term ‘sex × alcohol use’
were tested for each outcome adjusted for covariates and
found non-significant (P > 0.05). As a sensitivity analysis
to this single-step meta-analysis, we used the generalized
estimating equations (GEE) framework (with negative bi-
nomial distribution). To account for clustering of partici-
pants within cohorts, we added ‘cohort’ as cluster factor
(independent correlation structure).
RESULTS
The risk factors for sickness absence (older age, lower SES,
smoking and obesity) in each cohort by alcohol use are de-
scribed in Table 1. In HeSSup, persistent at-risk drinkers
had the highest average age. In the three other cohorts,
the differences in mean age by alcohol use were smaller.
In all cohorts, the prevalence of low SES was highest
among abstainers. Smoking was most common among
at-risk drinkers (either former, persistent or new). Obesity
was most common among persistent or new at-risk
drinkers in all cohorts, except for HeSSup, where obesity
was most prevalent among abstainers (Table 1).
We tested the ‘sex × alcohol use’ interaction with both
pooled data (adjusted for covariates) and with meta-
regression. All P-values for sex × alcohol use interaction
were > 0.05. Thus, we present the results in the whole
data set adjusting for sex.
In Supporting information, Table S1, we present the ob-
served (i.e. unadjusted) mean days of diagnosis-specific
sickness absence days per person-year by alcohol use in
each cohort. For most diagnoses, mean absence days were
highest either among persistent abstainers or among per-
sistent at-risk drinkers, corresponding to a U-shaped
relationship.
RR of diagnosis-specific sickness absence: two-step
meta-analysis
Figure 1 shows the pooled estimates of risk of sickness ab-
sence according to alcohol use. Compared to low-risk
drinkers (the reference group), there was a higher risk for
sickness absence due to mental disorders for abstainers.
People abstaining from alcohol also had a higher risk of
sickness absence due to musculoskeletal disorders, diseases
of the digestive system and disease of the respiratory sys-
tem. Former at-risk drinkers had a higher risk of sickness

 absence due to musculoskeletal disorder. Persistent at-risk
drinkers had a higher risk of sickness absence due to
external causes.
The study-specific estimates (+between-study hetero-
geneity values) and pooled random-effects estimates are
shown in Supporting information, Figs S1–S6. Significant
between-study heterogeneity was observed in sickness ab-
sence due to diseases of the respiratory system (I2 = 75%,
P = 0.007) among abstainers (Supporting information,
Fig. S5). All other statistically significant associations were
without significant heterogeneity. The estimates from
random-effects meta-analysis corresponded to those from
fixed-effects meta-analysis, except for wider confidence in-
tervals. The pooled random-effects estimate for abstainers
on sickness absence due to diseases of the respiratory sys-
tem was not significant (RR = 1.30, 95% CI = 0.91, 1.86).
RR of diagnosis-specific sickness absence: single-step
meta-analysis
Table 2 shows the observed (unadjusted) mean days sick-
ness absence per person-years and the estimates for the as-
sociation between alcohol use and diagnosis-specific
sickness absence from the pooled data. These results
corresponded to those from two-step meta-analysis.
Abstaining from alcohol was associated with higher risk
of sickness absence due to mental, musculoskeletal, diges-
tive and respiratory diagnoses. Former at-risk drinking
was associated with higher
risk of musculoskeletal
disorder-related sickness absence. Persistent at-risk drink-
ing was associated with higher risk of sickness absence re-
lated to external causes.
Sensitivity analyses with cohort as repeated subject
yielded additional statistically significant (P < 0.05) esti-
mates. In these analyses, abstaining was associated also
with sickness absence due to diseases of the circulatory sys-
tem. Former at-risk drinking was associated additionally
with higher risk of sickness absence due to diseases of the
circulatory and digestive system. Sickness absence due to
external causes was higher among new at-risk drinkers,
in addition to persistent at-risk drinkers (Supporting
information, Table S2).
Finally, we tested whether combining all at-risk
drinkers (regardless of change in drinking) to a single
group would affect the results. The results corresponded
to earlier results: at-risk drinking was associated with sick-
ness absence due to external causes (RR = 1.32, 95%
CI = 1.12, 1.55, Supporting information, Table S3).
DISCUSSION
This pooled analysis of four cohorts from three countries
provides new evidence about diseases underlying the U-
shaped association between alcohol use and sickness
absence. Compared to low-risk drinkers, abstainers had a
higher risk of sickness absence due to mental disorders,
musculoskeletal disorders, diseases of the respiratory
system and diseases of the digestive system. Former at-risk
drinkers had a higher risk of musculoskeletal disorder-
related sickness absence. Persistent at-risk drinkers had a
higher risk of sickness absence due to external causes (i.e.
injuries or poisoning) compared to low-risk drinkers.
Our findings demonstrate that the curvilinear associa-
tion, i.e. the higher risk of sickness absence among both ab-
stainers and at-risk drinkers, relates to a different set of
diagnosis of sickness absence for the two risk groups.
Several issues other than the effect of not using alcohol
may explain the higher absence rates due to both somatic
and
mental
diagnoses
in
abstainers.
For
example,
psychotrophic medication and diseases of the digestive sys-
tem often prevent alcohol use. Thus, the association be-
tween abstaining and increased risk of sickness absence
could be due in part to health selection; that is, groups with
increased disease burden, such as former heavy drinkers
and people abstaining due to health reasons, may have
been selected into the group of abstainers. In our data, at-
risk drinkers in the first survey but not in the second survey,
i.e. former at-risk drinkers, had an elevated risk of sickness
absence due to musculoskeletal disorders compared to low-
risk drinkers. Moreover, former at-risk drinkers may have
an elevated risk of short-term sickness absence, but our
data captured chronic, long-term illnesses most effectively.
At the other end of alcohol use, the link between heavy
drinking and poisoning is well established [22–24], and at
least two meta-analyses have found higher alcohol intake
to be associated with increased risk of injury [25,26]. Our
study supported these associations: persistent at-risk
drinkers had more sickness absence due to external causes
than low-risk drinkers. People classified into persistent at-
risk group may have more excessive drinking episodes,
which more probably result in injuries or even alcohol poi-
soning. In a previous study, binge drinking was related to
injury-related absenteeism [13].
Another explanation may be the healthy worker effect,
if participants to whom at-risk drinking causes health
problems are selected out from the labour market; that is,
if they retire early or become unemployed. Then, the ad-
verse health effects are not seen in absence from work
due to illness.
Strengths and limitations
Our study has several strengths, including a prospective
design, measuring alcohol use twice over time allowing
us to assess change in drinking behaviours and reliable
register-based sickness absence data with diagnosis codes.
Moreover, we could control for many life-style-related con-
founding factors.

Alcohol and sick leave diagnosis

 There were also limitations, including the inability to
control for life-time abstinence. However, in a previous
study with FPS data, both life-time and current abstinence
were linked with higher risk of sickness absence [1]. In
Finland, the diagnoses of sickness absence episodes are reg-
istered only for absences lasting for more than 9 days.
Thus, information on short-term episodes were available
for only GAZEL and Whitehall II cohorts. This affected
probably mainly sickness absence due to respiratory dis-
eases, where mild influenza, common cold or other acute
upper respiratory infections not usually causing work dis-
ability for 10 days are not recorded for FPS and HeSSup.
Consequently, the relative weight of Whitehall II and
GAZEL are much larger in these respiratory diagnoses.
However, approximately 50% of data on sickness absence
diagnosis was missing for short-term absences in GAZEL
data, which might have caused bias to our results. Limita-
tions also include self-report data on alcohol use, which
may cause measurement error if at-risk drinkers were in-
cluded in low-risk group. This would suggest that our
estimates may be underestimates of the true effect. How-
ever, we have shown previously that using a different
(UK-recommended) cut-off point for at-risk drinking pro-
duces similar associations to sickness absence [11].
Moreover, in HeSSup, FPS and GAZEL, we were unable
to identify transient absence from the labour force (such as
parental leaves, sabbatical, studying or unemployment)
from the at-risk time. However, in Finland, people receiving
parental, study, unemployment or sabbatical benefits are
entitled to sickness benefit if they become ill (after the 10-
day reimbursement period), and thus they were technically
at-riskof sickness absence even if they were not working. In
the French GAZEL cohort, the participants were ageing
(mean age 51 years) at the beginning of the follow-up.
Thus, during the 7-year follow-up, 80% of them retired
(at an average age of 55 years). There were hardly any pa-
rental leaves in this cohort.
Finally, differences between sickness absence certifi-
cation schemes between countries can cause residual
confounding. However, we had very little significant
between-study
heterogeneity,
which
increases
the
strength of evidence.
CONCLUSION
People abstaining from alcohol had a higher risk of sickness
absence due to chronic mental and somatic disorders com-
pared to low-risk drinkers, and persistent at-risk drinkers
hadmoresicknessabsenceduetoexternalcausescompared
to persistently low-risk drinkers. The U-shaped alcohol use–
sickness absence association seems thus to comprise differ-
entialdiagnosticpatternsatbothendsofalcoholusecontin-
uum. Our results can help occupational health care and
facilitate early interventions/auditing for at-risk alcohol
use when accumulating sickness absence due to external
causes are observed.
