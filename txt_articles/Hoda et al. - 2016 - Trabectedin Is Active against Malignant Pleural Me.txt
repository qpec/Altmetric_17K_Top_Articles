Abstract
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is characterized by
widespread resistance to systemic therapy. Trabectedin is an
antineoplastic agent targeting both the malignant cells and the
tumor microenvironment that has been approved for the treat-
ment of advanced soft tissue sarcoma and ovarian cancer. In this
preclinical study, we evaluated the antineoplastic potential of
trabectedin as a single agent and in drug combination approaches
in human MPM. Therefore, we utilized an extended panel of MPM
cell lines (n ¼ 6) and primary cell cultures from surgical MPM
specimens (n ¼ 13), as well as nonmalignant pleural tissue
samples (n ¼ 2). Trabectedin exerted a dose-dependent cytotoxic
effect in all MPM cell cultures in vitro when growing as adherent
monolayers or nonadherent spheroids with IC50 values � 2.6
nmol/L. Nonmalignant mesothelial cells were significantly less
responsive. The strong antimesothelioma activity was based on
cell-cycle perturbation and apoptosis induction. The activity of
trabectedin against MPM cells was synergistically enhanced by
coadministration of cisplatin, a drug routinely used for systemic
MPM treatment. Comparison of gene expression signatures indi-
cated an inverse correlation between trabectedin response and
bcl-2 expression. Accordingly, bcl-2 inhibitors (Obatoclax, ABT-
199) markedly synergized with trabectedin paralleled by deregu-
lated expression of the bcl-2 family members bcl-2, bim, bax,
Mcl-1, and bcl-xL as a consequence of trabectedin exposure. In
addition, trabectedin exerted significant antitumor activity against
an intraperitoneal MPM xenograft model. Together, these data
suggest that trabectedin exerts strong activity in MPM and syner-
gizes with chemotherapy and experimental bcl-2 inhibitors in
vitro. Thus, it represents a promising new therapeutic option for
MPM. Mol Cancer Ther; 15(10); 2357–69. �2016 AACR.
Introduction
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) represents a highly
lethal malignancy of the mesothelium with increasing inci-
dence, which is in the vast majority of cases caused by asbestos
exposure (1). It has been estimated that within the next 30
years 250,000 people in Europe will die of MPM, and 2,500–
3,000 new cases are diagnosed each year in the United States
(2, 3).The long latency period (even 20–40 years) between the
first exposure to asbestos and the diagnosis of MPM suggests
that multiple genetic alterations are needed for malignant
transformation of the mesothelial cells (4). There exist three
histologic subtypes of MPM, epithelioid, sarcomatoid, and
biphasic, the latter two being especially refractory to current
therapy options (5, 6). The expected median survival of
patients suffering from MPM is between 4 and 12 months
(7). This adverse prognosis is also caused by the distinct
resistance against systemic therapy options. Hence, the current
preferred
chemotherapy
(pemetrexed/cisplatin)
prolongs
median survival only by a few months (8). Also aggressive
cytoreductive therapy, including macroscopic complete resec-
tion by extrapleural pneumonectomy or pleurectomy/decorti-
cation in combination with chemotherapy and radiotherapy
(termed trimodality therapy), has been shown to prolong
survival only in selected patients with early MPM (6). However,
due to the limited diagnostic options and treatment modalities
at the disseminated stage, better understanding of the molec-
ular factors contributing to the development of MPM are
urgently needed to identify new molecular therapy targets.
Recently, the anticancer potential of marine-based cytotoxic
compounds came into focus and is currently evaluated in various

 malignancies (9). Trabectedin (also called ET743, tradename:
Yondelis) is an antineoplastic substance originally isolated
from the Caribbean marine tunicate Ecteinascidia turbinate
(10) exerting considerable antitumor activity in murine and
human tumors in vitro and in vivo including melanoma, non–
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ovarian cancer, as well as
anaplastic meningioma (11–15). Recently, a preliminary phar-
macokinetic study in xenograft models has been published
suggesting selective accumulation of trabectedin in MPM tissue
(16). Trabectedin was active in early clinical trials against
several solid tumors, including melanoma, NSCLC, breast,
prostate, and renal cancers (17). It has been approved for
treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcoma (STS) and in patients
with platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer in combina-
tion with PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin (18, 19).
The detailed mode of action of trabectedin is not fully
understood and the antitumor effects of the drug are based
on multiple mechanisms. First, it binds into the minor DNA
groove and interacts with repair mechanisms. Interestingly, the
nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, known to protect
against cisplatin-induced DNA adducts (20), sensitizes against
trabectedin (21). In addition, trabectedin selectively interferes
with the activity of several oncogenic transcription factors and,
consequently, blocks expression of several oncogenes and
multidrug resistance factors (22). Besides targeting the malig-
nant cells, trabectedin might also interfere with the cancer
microenvironment (17, 21) and especially depletion of tumor-
associated macrophages might be central to its anticancer
effects (23). However, the preclinical activity of trabectedin
in MPM has not been investigated in detail so far. Therefore,
we aimed to test in vitro and in vivo activity against MPM cell
lines, primary cell cultures, and a tumor xenograft. Moreover,
the feasibility of a combination setting with the standard anti-
MPM chemotherapeutics and experimental bcl-2 inhibitors
was evaluated.
Materials and Methods
Cell culture
SPC111 and SPC212 cells (from biphasic MPM) were kindly
provided by Prof. R. Stahel (Zurich, Switzerland). The cisplatin-
resistant subline P31res1.2 was established from the parental P31
by in vitro cisplatin selection (ref. 24; kindly donated by Prof. K.
Grankvist, Umea, Sweden). Other cell lines obtained from inter-
national sources were: M38K (provided by Prof. V.L. Kinnula,
Helsinki, Finland) and I2 (Prof. A. Catania, Milan, Italy). The
MPM primary cell cultures VMC6, 12, 14, 20, 23, 28, 33, 40, and
45 were established at the Institute of Cancer Research, as well as
Meso49, 53, 62, and 80 at the Division of Thoracic Surgery, both
Medical University of Vienna (Vienna, Austria; ref. 25). NP2 and
NP3 cell lines were established from nonmalignant pleural tissue
samples obtained during pneumothorax operations. Cell line
sources and histologic subtypes of the respective tumors are listed
in Supplementary Table S1. Cell line P31 and its cisplatin-resistant
derivative P31res1.2 were maintained in minimal essential medi-
um (MEM) with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. All other cell lines
were cultured in RPMI medium with 10% FBS. Cell lines were kept
in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 and were regularly
checked for Mycoplasma contamination. Cell lines were authen-
ticated by array comparative genomic hybridization or DNA
fingerprinting.
Drugs
Trabectedin was obtained from Zelita/Pharmamar and cisplat-
in from Sigma. The bcl-2 protein inhibitors obatoclax and ABT-
199 were purchased from Selleck Chemicals Inc..
Chemosensitivity assays
To determine cell viability, 3-(4,5 dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-
diphenyltetrazolium
bromide
(MTT)-based
survival
assays
(EZ4U; Biomedics) were performed as published previously
(25–27). Mesothelioma cell cultures were seeded in 96-well plates
at a density of 2 � 103/100 mL per well 24 hours before drug
treatment. Drug exposure time was 72 hours. Interactions
between drugs were tested on the basis of calculating the com-
bination index (CI) according to Chou and Talalay (28) with
CalcuSyn software (Biosoft). CI values <0.9, from 0.9 to 1.1, or
>1.1 represented synergism, additive effects, and antagonism of
the two investigated substances, respectively.
Clonogenic assay
Cells were seeded into 6-well plates at densities of 2–5 � 103
cells/well 24 hours before treatment. After 7 days, the drug-
containing medium was removed and cell clones were washed,
fixed, and stained as published previously (29). The results were
quantified with ImageJ software.
Spheroid growth assay
For the spheroid growth assay, 5 � 103 cells were seeded in
triplicate in serum-free DMEM/Ham F-12 medium (Biochrom)
supplemented with 20 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor
(bFGF, Eubio, Austria), 20 ng/mL EGF (Sigma) and 2% B27
supplement (PAA Laboratories) in ultra-low attachment 24-
well plates (Corning) as described before (26). Trabectedin was
added at 1 or 5 nmol/L. Ninety-six hours later, the entire wells
were photographed and all spheroids measured with ImageJ
software. Only spheroids with a diameter over 100 mm were
evaluated to exclude cell clumps from the analysis. Self-renewal
potential was tested by disintegration of spheroids to single-cell
solution after treatment with trypsin (0.1%) and EDTA (0.01%)
for 10 minutes. Cells were then resuspended in DMEM/FBS
medium, washed once in serum-free medium, and passed
through a 70-mm filter (BD Biosciences) followed by replating
in spheroid growth medium in ultra-low attachment plates as
described above.
Western blot analysis
MPM cells were seeded onto 6-well plates at a density of 5 �
105 per well and, following 24-hour drug exposure, collected
and lyzed. Proteins were extracted and processed for SDS-
PAGE and immunoblotting was performed as published pre-
viously (30). The following primary antibodies were used:
PARP (detecting full-length and cleaved PARP), cleaved PARP,
bax, bim, bak, Mcl-1, bcl-2, bcl-xL, cyclin A2, and cyclin E1 (all
from Cell Signaling Technology), p53 (DO1; Neomarkers),
cyclin B1, cyclin D1 (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
and b-actin (Sigma) at 1:1,000 dilutions in phosphate-buff-
ered saline with 3% BSA. Horseradish peroxidase–coupled
anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies (3% BSA, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) were used at 1:10,000 dilutions and developed
by Western blotting with Luminol Reagent Kit (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology).

 Apoptosis detection by TUNEL assay
For apoptosis induction experiments, cells were seeded on 24-
well plates and treated with trabectedin. After 48 hours of treat-
ment, cells were fixed with 4% buffered paraformaldehyde and
labeling of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated
dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) was performed according to
the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Diagnostics). Quantifica-
tion was done by direct counting of the TUNEL-positive cells in at
least five 20� microscopic fields.
Hoechst 33258/propidium iodide (HOE/PI) staining
SPC111, SPC212, P31, and P31res1.2 cells (2 � 104 cells/well)
were seeded in 24-well plates and allowed to recover for 24 hours.
Cells were treated with trabectedin, cisplatin, obatoclax, and their
combinations for the indicated exposure times. Next, cell culture
supernatants were supplemented with 2 mL/mL Hoechst 33258
/propidium iodide (HOE/PI) mix [Hoechst 33258 (1 mg/mL)
and PI (2.5 mg/mL)] for at least 1 hour at 37�C. While Hoechst
33258 stains DNA and is taken up by living and dead cells, PI
enters dead cells only. Consequently, blue Hoechst 33258 fluo-
rescence allows identification of cells in mitosis or early apoptosis
(condensed chromatin but PI-negative), while PI positivity indi-
cates dead cells and, in connection with chromatin condensation
in Hoechst staining, late apoptosis. Live photomicrographs of
control and treated cells were taken after 24 and 48 hours using
fluorescent equipment on the Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted micro-
scope system. Four optical fields per well of two experiments
performed in duplicate were captured with 4,6-diamidino-2-
phenylindole (DAPI), Cy3 and phase-contrast filters settings, and
evaluated (mitosis, early/late apoptosis).
Cell-cycle analysis
Cells were seeded onto 6-well plates at a density of 2 � 105 cells
per well 24 hours before drug treatment. After 48 hours of
exposure, the cells were trypsinized, pelleted, and processed for
cell-cycle analyses by PI staining and flow cytometry using fluo-
rescence-activated cell sorting (FACSCalibur; Becton Dickinson)
according to the standard protocols. The results were evaluated
using ModFit software (Becton Dickinson).
Transmigration assay
For measurement of transmigration through a porous mem-
brane, cells were seeded in density of 4 � 104 cells into Boyden
chambers with 8-mm pore size. Subsequently, these chambers
were placed into 24-well plates containing 1 mL medium with
10% FBS. After seeding, cells were treated with trabectedin for 24
hours. Thereafter, chambers were removed and treatment medi-
um was replaced by fresh medium with 10% FBS. Those cells
which had been migrated to the bottom of the wells were further
incubated for additional 7 days and stained with crystal violet.
Finally, 2% SDS was used to resolubilize the dye and absorbance
was measured at 562 nm on a microplate reader.
Wound closure assay
Cells (5 � 105/well) were seeded into 6-well plates. When
confluency was reached, scratches were applied with a pipette tip
in the shape of a cross. After washing and medium replacement,
the indicated drug concentrations were added. Wells were photo-
graphed after 0, 4, 8, 24, and 48 hours and closure of the artificial
gap was calculated from the microphotographs using ImageJ
software (NIH, Bethesda, MD)
Isolation of total RNA and whole genome gene expression array
performance
Total RNA was isolated by TRIzol/chloroform (Life Technolo-
gies), and quantity as well as integrity of the RNA samples was
checked on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Gene expression arrays
were performed using 4 � 44K (Design 014850) whole genome
oligonucleotide-based gene expression arrays (Agilent) as pub-
lished previously (27). Feature extraction and data analysis were
carried out using the Feature Extraction, GeneSpring, and Inge-
nuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software packages. Data analysis
with the GeneSpring software (Agilent Technologies) was per-
formed using the default parameters (Guided Workflow).
Animals
Six- to 8-week-old female CB-17 scid/scid (SCID) mice were
purchased from Harlan Laboratories (San Pietro al Natisone). The
animals were kept in a pathogen-free environment and every
procedure was done in a laminar airflow cabinet. The experiments
were performed according to the regulations of the Ethics Com-
mittee for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals at the Medical
University Vienna (proposal numbers BMWF-66.009/0157-II/
10b/2008 and BMWF-66.009/0084-II/3b/2013), the U.S. Public
Health Service Policy on Human Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals as well as the United Kingdom Coordinating Committee
on Cancer Prevention Research's Guidelines for the Welfare of
Animals in Experimental Neoplasia.
Intraperitoneal xenograft models
SPC111 cells (1 � 106) in 100 mL serum-free medium were
injected intraperitoneally into SCID mice (in total n ¼ 10) as
published previously (26). Three weeks after inoculation, mice
were assigned into treatment groups, each consisting of 5 mice:
(1) treated with 0.9% NaCl; (2) trabectedin (0.15 mg/kg dissolved
in 0.9% NaCl) as a single shot treatment. All substances were
applied intravenously via tail vein injection. Performance status
and body weight were checked every second day. The experiment
was terminated after 36 days from transplantation when the first
animal had to be sacrificed (by cervical dislocation after anesthe-
sia with 5 mg/kg Rompun and 100 mg/kg Ketavet) due to signs of
distress. Tumor nodules were harvested by a thoracic surgeon (M.
A. Hoda) using magnifying spectacles blinded with regard to
trabectedin/solvent treatment. All nodules from each mouse were
pooled and weighed.
Statistical analysis
Unless stated otherwise, data are presented as means � SD of at
least three experiments performed in triplicate. Statistical signif-
icance between treatment groups was analyzed with Prism 5.0
(GraphPad) or SPSS17 software (SPSS Inc.) using Student t test, c2
test, or one-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparison test as
appropriate. In all cases, P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

against all MPM cell lines at low nanomolar or even picomolar
concentrations (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Table S1) and even
0.1 nmol/L suppressed clonogenicity by more than 50%
(Fig. 1B). In comparison, 2.5 mmol/L cisplatin were needed to
reduce clonogenicity to a comparable level in SPC111 and
SPC212 cells. The parental P31 cell model was even more respon-
sive to 0.1 nmol/L trabectedin than to 2.5 mmol/L cisplatin
treatment while acquired cisplatin resistance of P31res1.2 cells
did not alter trabectedin response. On the basis of these initial
promising results, two different panels of primary MPM cell cul-

MPM cell viability is reduced by trabectedin in a dose-dependent manner. A, short-term drug exposure (72 hours) test was performed by MTT assay to
determine trabectedin responsiveness of epithelioid (P31, P31res1.2) and biphasic (SPC111, SPC212) MPM cell models and normal pleural cell cultures
(NP2, NP3). One representative experiment performed in triplicate is shown. For mean IC50 values (from at least two independent experiments performed
in triplicate) compare Supplementary Table S1. B, effects of long-term exposure to trabectedin and cisplatin on colony formation of the indicated cell
lines were investigated. After 7 days of exposure, cells were stained with crystal violet and colonies were counted. Data from three independent
experiments are normalized to controls (Co); bars, SD; ���, P < 0.0005. C, the impact of trabectedin on nonadherent spheroid formation of MPM cells
was evaluated after a 96-hour drug exposure. Significant reduction of spheroid size and number could be observed upon trabectedin treatment. In
all cases, data are means of at least three independent experiments; bars, SD; �, P < 0.05. D, representative photographs of spheroid formation experiments
in SPC111 and SPC212 cells are shown. Scale bar, 100 mm.

 were tested (epithelioid and nonepithelioid in Supplementary
Fig. S1A and S1B, respectively). Viability of all malignant cell
models was reduced by trabectedin with IC50 values � 2.6 nmol/L
and frequently even in the picomolar range (Supplementary Table
S1). In contrast, primary cultures of nonmalignant mesothelial
cells were comparably less sensitive with a mean IC50 value of 3.39
nmol/L. Interestingly, we observed a tendency towards trabecte-
din hypersensitivity in the cisplatin-resistant P31res1.2 as com-
pared with the parental cell line P31 being one of the least
responsive MPM cell model in the tested panel (Fig. 1A; Supple-
mentary Table S1). In addition, no significant relation was found
between trabectedin and cisplatin response suggesting a different
cellular mode-of-action. Although cell models derived from the
major histologies of MPM did not significantly differ concerning
responsiveness to both drugs, a trend towards enhanced trabec-
tedin activity against nonepithelioid MPM cell cultures was
observed (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
Trabectedin reduces MPM spheroid growth in nonadherent cell
cultures
To investigate the effect of trabectedin on 3D cell growth and on
the stem cell-like MPM cell subpopulation, nonadherent spher-
oids were generated (Fig. 1C). All four MPM cell lines tested
formed a low number (<8) of large spheroids in every control well
based on early fusion of multiple small spheroids. In biphasic
MPM cell
models
(SPC111,
SPC212), trabectedin
widely
impaired spheroid formation already at a concentration of 1
nmol/L (Fig. 1C, bottom, and SPC111 as well as SPC212 repre-
sentatively in Fig. 1D). P31 and P31res1.2 cell spheroids were still
formed at 1 nmol/L but with decreased number (Fig. 1C, bottom)
and diameter (Fig. 1C, top). Of note, sensitivity was slightly higher
in the P31res1.2 subline with acquired cisplatin resistance. Spher-
oid formation was completely impaired at 5 nmol/L in case of
both the biphasic and the epithelioid cell lines. Moreover, the self-
renewal capacity of spheroids was blocked completely in the
presence of trabectedin.
Trabectedin dose-dependently increases apoptosis of MPM
cells
To investigate apoptosis induction, HOE/PI staining (Fig. 2A
and B) and TUNEL assays (Fig. 2C) were performed. Already in
phase-contrast images a massive reduction of viable SPC111
cells and a loss of cell–cell contact as a consequence of a 24-
hour exposure to 2.5 nmol/L trabectedin was observed.
Hoechst 33258 dye staining elucidated frequent chromatin
condensation indicative for apoptotic cell death induction.
Indeed, a high percentage of cells with condensed chromatin
double stained with PI confirmed late-stage apoptotic cell
death (Fig. 2A). Total apoptotic count is shown in Fig. 2B
indicating significantly enhanced apoptosis rates already at 1
nmol/L trabectedin in all four cell lines tested. Relevant num-
bers of necrosis were not found. These results were confirmed
by TUNEL assay detecting apoptosis-related DNA strand breaks
(Fig. 2C). The comparably weaker apoptosis induction in
TUNEL assay might be based on the loss of nonadherent
late apoptotic cells during washing and fixation steps. To
dissect the molecular mechanisms involved in trabectedin-
induced apoptosis, Western blot analysis was carried out after
24 hours drug exposure (Fig. 2D). PARP cleavage, slightly
detectable already at 1 nmol/L but massively enhanced at 10
nmol/L trabectedin, confirmed the involvement of caspases in
the apoptotic process. Furthermore, upregulation primarily of
the proapoptotic bcl-2 family members bim and bax was
detected at 1 nmol/L trabectedin, while at the massively cyto-
toxic dose of 10 nmol/L protein levels sharply dropped. With
regard to the antiapoptotic family members, trabectedin treat-
ment resulted in reduced expression of bcl-2 in the P31 model
and of Mcl-1 in all MPM cell lines tested. P53 was only
detectable in SPC111 and SPC212 and was slightly upregulated
after trabectedin exposure while P31 and P31res1.2 cells lacked
p53 expression.
Trabectedin at subtoxic concentrations inhibits MPM cell
invasion but not migration
Cell invasion, measured by migration of cells through Matrigel-
sealed Boyden chamber membrane pores, was weakly but signif-
icantly inhibited at 0.5 and 1 nmol/L trabectedin treatment in
three of the four tested MPM cell lines (Fig. 3A). The observed
effects are considered widely independent of cell growth inhibi-
tion, as trabectedin at least at 0.5 nmol/L did not induce major
cytotoxicity during the 28-hour observation time. In contrast to
invasion, cell migration, analyzed by in vitro wound closure assay,
was not significantly inhibited up to 1 nmol/L trabectedin with
the exception of SPC111 at 8 and 12 hours exposure (Supple-
mentary Fig. S2). Accordingly, also in videomicroscopy rather
enhanced than reduced cell movement was observed in trabecte-
din-treated cells before undergoing cell death (Supplementary
Video SV1).
Trabectedin treatment alters mitosis rate and cell-cycle
distribution in MPM cells
In HOE/PI staining a clear-cut reduction of cells in mitotic
phase of the cell cycle was detected already from doses of 1
nmol/L onwards (Fig. 3B). Consequently, we investigated the
impact of trabectedin on cell-cycle distribution by PI staining
and FACS analysis at low trabectedin concentrations (Fig. 3C).
Especially, in the two biphasic cell models an accumulation of
cells in the G2–M and a decrease of the G0–G1 phase were
observed already at a concentration of 0.5 nmol/L. This effect
was also visible but less pronounced in the less responsive p31
and p31res1.2 cells. Together with the HOE/PI data, the FACS
analyses suggest an accumulation of cells in G2 phase of the cell
cycle. Accordingly, expression of cyclin D1 tended to be
reduced after trabectedin treatment at 1 nmol/L, while cyclin
A2 (representative for the G2–M transition) was distinctly
increased in line with the accumulation of cells in G2 phase
(Fig. 3D). At the highly cytotoxic trabectedin concentration (10
nmol/L), cyclin E1 levels (G1–S) were elevated and cyclin A2
upregulation lost.
Trabectedin reduces growth of an intraperitoneal MPM
xenograft model
SCID mice carrying human SPC111 xenografts were treated
with a single injection of 0.15 mg/kg trabectedin or solvent
intravenously (compare Materials and Methods). Trabectedin
was generally well tolerated with no major toxicity during the
observation period. Mice were sacrificed 15 days after drug
administration and all tumor nodules collected from the perito-
neal cavity (representative animals from each group are shown
in Fig. 4A). The mean tumor weight was distinctly reduced (by
43%) indicating that even single administration of trabectedin led

 to a significant reduction of the intraperitoneal tumor burden
(Fig. 4B). This activity was comparable with the one observed in
case of cisplatin monotherapy for the identical MPM model tested
in frame of a previous study (26).
Combination of trabectedin with cisplatin results in synergistic
anticancer effects
Next, we tested whether trabectedin might be a feasible
option for combination approaches with the standard-of-care
mesothelioma drugs pemetrexed and cisplatin. While the
multitargeted antimetabolic drug pemetrexed showed mainly
additive to antagonistic effects with trabectedin, cisplatin
exerted primarily synergistic activities. This was already clearly
observable in HOE/PI staining with distinctly enhanced apo-
ptotic rates at a combination of 1 nmol/L trabectedin and 5
mmol/L cisplatin (Fig. 5A and B). Predominantly synergistic
effects were confirmed by dose–response curves established by
viability assays following 72-hour drug exposure in all four

 of the investigated MPM cell lines were established. When com-
paring MPM cell models categorized according to trabectedin
sensitivity into high (h)- and low (l)-responsive subgroups
(dichotomized by the median IC50 value, Supplementary Table
S1), distinct gene expression differences regarding apoptosis-
related genes were observed. Analyses of both the "KEGG_Apop-
tosis" and the "BIOCARTA_Death Pathway" gene sets depicted the
strongest expression differences (4.4-fold up in the low-respon-
sive subgroup) for the anti-apoptotic gene BCL2 (Supplementary
Table S2). Accordingly, a significant inverse correlation between
bcl-2 mRNA expression and trabectedin response was observed
(Supplementary Fig. S4A). Also analysis of the data by Ingenuity
software suggested deregulation of a bcl-2 pathway network
between the two subgroups (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Accord-
ingly, we decided to test whether pharmacologic inhibition of the
antiapoptotic bcl-2 family members by obatoclax (31) would
synergize with trabectedin against MPM cells. HOE/PI staining
indicated distinctly higher rates of apoptosis in the combination
groups, with the most prominent effects seen in the less trabecte-
din-responsive MPM cell models SPC212 and p31 (Fig. 6A).
Likewise, in 72-hour drug exposure MTT assays a clear synergism
(CI values < 0.9) between trabectedin (at low nanomolar to
picomolar concentrations) and obatoclax was observed in all cell
models tested (Fig. 6B and Supplementary Fig. S5A). Further-
more, the combination of trabectedin with obatoclax enhanced
cleavage of PARP and caspase-7 as well as upregulated proapop-
totic bim in SPC111 and SPC212 cells (Fig. 6C). Comparable
observations were made in the P31 cell models with the difference
that in this MPM cell model caspase-7 was undetectable at the
protein level (Supplementary Fig. S5B). Interestingly, obatoclax
alone tended to enhance bcl-2 protein levels. This effect was
attenuated or inhibited by trabectedin coexposure especially in
the SPC111 and the P31res1.2 cell models (Fig. 6C and Supple-
mentary Fig. S5B).
Regarding temporal resolution, MPM cell death was monitored
over 48 hours by videomicroscopy (the 24- to 49-hour exposure
time frame is shown in Supplementary Video SV1). Trabectedin as
single drug (2.5 nmol/L) led, in addition to occasional apoptotic
events, to reduced cell proliferation and enhanced cell volumes
well in agreement with the loss of mitosis and the G2 cell cycle
arrest (compare Fig. 3B and C). Obatoclax alone (500 nmol/L) led
to a dramatic change in cell shape and gain of a more fibroblastoid
and highly migratory phenotype. In the combination group,
massive cell death occurred especially after around 30–48 hours
of exposure. As obatoclax is a relatively unspecific bcl-2 inhibitor,
we tested the combination of trabectedin also with the more
selective compound ABT-199 (32). This combination again led to
mostly additive to synergistic activities in the MPM cell lines tested
(Supplementary Fig. S6).
Discussion
Chemotherapy still remains the main backbone of systemic
MPM therapy. Platinum in combination with pemetrexed has so
far proven to be the most effective first-line treatment combina-
tion. However, median survival rates remain poor and chemo-
therapy in this setting can only improve survival by a few months
(8). In terms of second- or even third-line treatment, no drugs,
either classic cytotoxic or targeted agents, have been effective so
far. Therefore, an unmet need for the discovery of more potent
agents still exists.
In this preclinical study, we show that the marine-derived
alkaloid trabectedin (i) reduces MPM cell growth in a dose-
dependent manner in both monolayer and multicellular spheroid
cell cultures; (ii) induces apoptosis accompanied by changes in
the expression of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic regulators; (iii)
is able to weakly but significantly inhibit cell invasion without
influencing the migratory potential of MPM cells; (iv) alters MPM
cell mitosis rates and leads to perturbation of the cell cycle; (v)
strongly reduces tumor growth in vivo in an orthotopic MPM
xenograft model in SCID mice; and (vi) acts synergistically with
cisplatin and bcl-2 inhibitors in vitro. In addition, trabectedin
activity was distinctly higher in case of MPM cell explants as
compared to those from nonmalignant pleural tissue. This corre-
sponds well with preliminary published data on selective accu-
mulation of trabectedin in MPM as compared with plasma and
nonmalignant tissue (16).

as a single agent and in combination with cisplatin at the indicated concentrations. Subsequently, HOE/PI staining was performed to assess apoptosis
induction. A, representative photomicrographs of SPC111 cells were taken after 24-hour drug exposure. B, mean percentage of apoptotic cells was determined in the
four indicated MPM cell lines following treatment for 24 and 48 hours. Mean percentage of apoptotic cells was determined from at least three independent

 patient-derived mesothelioma xenografts (33). In addition, a few
mesothelioma cases within two phase I trials were reported.
Interestingly, in two of these MPM cases, clinical response (partial
responses and stable disease) was seen (34, 35), giving a first hint
for clinical activity in this notoriously unresponsive tumor
type. Consequently, a phase II trial (trial registration ID:
NCT02194231) has been launched recently (36) and preliminary
results were presented on ASCO 2015 indicating clinical benefit
especially for patients with nonepithelioid histology (37). This is
in good accordance with our preclinical data, demonstrating a
tendency towards enhanced activity in primary cell cultures
derived from patients with biphasic or sarcomatoid MPM. Of
note, the standard MPM chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin is
known to be more efficient in epithelioid MPM subtypes. This
implies that cisplatin and trabectedin might represent a feasible
combination therapy strategy for MPM. Indeed in several tumor
types such as ovarian cancer, breast cancer and diverse sarcomas
(38–41) combination of platinum compounds with trabectedin
has proven to be synergistic both in vitro and in vivo. In accordance,
phase I studies including both patients with sarcomas and diverse
carcinomas have reported that the combination of cisplatin and
trabectedin is feasible, well tolerated, and showed antitumor
effects in heavily pretreated patients (42, 43). Nevertheless, our
attempts to combine trabectedin and cisplatin in vivo resulted,
despite indications of distinct anti-MPM activity, in premature
experiment termination due to local toxicity at the injection sites
and distinct weight loss of mice. Consequently, alternative appli-
cation routes using osmotic pump–mediated infusion, more
closely mimicking the clinical form of trabectedin application
via infusion, are currently established.
At the molecular level, the synergism between trabectedin and
cisplatin might be caused by the specific modes of action and
interaction with repair pathways characteristic for these two DNA-
interacting compounds (21). While trabectedin exerts its activity
at least in part by a mode-of-action involving nucleotide excision
repair (NER), this repair mechanism is well known to protect
against cisplatin-induced DNA damage by recognizing and
removing DNA platinum adducts. Cancer cells which are deficient
in NER exert high sensitivity to cisplatin but show resistance to
trabectedin treatment (44, 45). In contrast, mismatch repair
mechanisms are contributing to cisplatin- but not trabectedin-
mediated cell death while homologous recombination repair
(HR) protects against both compounds (21). Accordingly, tra-
bectedin activity was not reduced but in selected cases even
enhanced in cisplatin-resistant cancer sublines (45) and vice versa
(46). This holds also true for an MPM cell model with acquired
cisplatin resistance in our study (p31 and p31res1.2), exhibiting
mild hypersensitivity against trabectedin in vitro and overexpres-
sion of several NER components in gene expression arrays. This
makes sense as MPM represents a very treatment-refractory tumor
type rarely responding to platinum-based drugs used in clinical
routine. Probably reflecting its proinflammatory origin, DNA
repair mechanisms play an integral role in the resistance of MPM
to cytotoxic agents (47). With regard to NER, polymorphisms in
two genes (ERCC1, XPD) influenced platinum-treatment efficacy
and toxicity in a series of 133 mesothelioma patients (48).
Together, this indicates that the opposite interaction with NER
processes might be central to the synergism between trabectedin
and cisplatin also in case of MPM.
To determine major players in regulating trabectedin response
in our collection of MPM primary cell cultures, gene signature
differences between the more and less responsive MPM subgroup
have been compared. Concerning several apoptosis-related sig-
natures, the gene most strongly upregulated in the less trabecte-
din-sensitive MPM cell cultures was BCL2, an antiapoptotic mem-
ber of the bcl-2 family of cell death regulators. Consequently, we
investigated whether a combination of trabectedin with bcl-2
inhibitors in vitro might be a feasible strategy for treatment of
MPM. Indeed, two small-molecule bcl-2–interacting drugs with
different specificities (obatoclax and ABT-199; refs. 31, 32) dem-
onstrated synergistic activities in multiple cell biological assays.
Western blots confirmed that several members of the bcl-2 family
are altered by this novel anticancer drug combination in a syn-
ergistic manner. Thus, a clear-cut activation of the proapoptotic
bim and in some cases also bax already at low trabectedin
concentrations was further enhanced by administration of oba-
toclax. In contrast, expression of the antiapoptotic bcl-2, bcl-xL
and Mcl-1 family members was distinctly reduced by trabectedin.
This implicates a shift towards cell death induction well in
accordance with the data derived from diverse cell death assays
including PARP and caspase cleavage. Accordingly, it was reported
that siRNA-mediated knockdown of bcl-xL and Mcl-1 was suffi-
cient to induce MPM cell death without the need for an additional
chemotherapeutic compound (49). In addition, the anticancer
activity of the BH3 a-helix mimetic JY-1-106 was found to be
mediated by disruption of bcl-xL and Mcl-1 protein–protein
interactions with Bak in diverse cancer cell lines including MPM
(50). Altered expression of bcl-2 family members including bim
was also reported as a mechanism underlying apoptosis resistance
in MPM spheroids (51). This corresponds well to the destruction
of spheroid growth, representing a surrogate marker for the cancer
stem cell compartment, of our MPM cell lines already at 1 nmol/L
trabectedin. However, this promising in vitro synergism of tra-
bectedin and bcl-2 inhibition needs to be further confirmed in
in vivo models.
In summary, we present evidence that trabectedin is active as a
single agent against human MPM in vitro and in vivo by directly
targeting antiapoptotic mechanisms. Accordingly, this effect can
be synergistically enhanced either by chemotherapeutic agents
inducing apoptosis (like cisplatin) or by agents targeting anti-
apoptotic bcl-2 family members (like obatoclax and ABT-199)
in vitro. Together with the published early indication of clinical

Trabectedin distinctly synergizes with the bcl-2 inhibitor obatoclax. A, after 48-hour exposure to trabectedin or obatoclax and their combinations
as indicated, MPM cell lines were stained with HOE/PI to evaluate apoptosis induction. Data shown represent mean percentage of apoptotic cells
derived from at least three independent experiments; bars, SD; ��, P < 0.005; ���, P < 0.0005; ����, P < 0.00005. B, dose–response curves for
obatoclax without or with the indicated trabectedin concentrations are shown for SPC111 and SPC212 cell lines. Viability was measured by MTT assay
after 72-hour drug exposure and normalized to untreated controls (left). Combination indices (CI) were calculated by CalcuSyn Software from the
data of the viability assays (right). C, SPC111 and SPC212 cells were cultured in the presence of increasing concentrations of trabectedin and
obatoclax alone or in combination for 48 hours. Impact of the trabectedin–obatoclax combination on the cleavage of caspase-7 and PARP as well as on
expression of several key apoptosis-regulating proteins was analyzed by Western blot analysis. HOE, Hoechst 33342 dye; PI, propidium iodide.
