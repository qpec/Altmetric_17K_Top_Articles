Abstract
Background: Historically, bifidobacteria were the dominant intestinal bacteria in breastfed infants. Still abundant in
infants in developing nations, levels of intestinal bifidobacteria are low among infants in developed nations. Recent
studies have described an intimate relationship between human milk and a specific subspecies of Bifidobacterium,
B. longum subsp. infantis (B. infantis), yet supplementation of breastfed, healthy, term infants with this organism, has
not been reported. The IMPRINT Study, a Phase I clinical trial, was initiated to determine the safety and tolerability
of supplementing breastfed infants with B. infantis (EVC001).
Methods: Eighty mother-infant dyads were enrolled in either lactation support plus B. infantis supplementation
(BiLS) or lactation support alone (LS). Starting with Day 7 postnatal, BiLS infants were fed 1.8–2.8 × 1010 CFU B.
infantis EVC001 daily in breast milk for 21 days. Mothers collected fecal samples, filled out health questionnaires,
and kept daily logs about their infants’ feeding and gastrointestinal symptoms from birth until Day 61 postnatal.
Safety and tolerability were determined from maternal reports.
Results: There were no differences in the mean gestational age at birth, weight 1 and 2 months postnatal, and
breast milk intake between groups. The mean Log10 change in fecal Bifidobacterium from Day 6 to Day 28 was higher
(p = 0.0002) for BiLS (6.6 ± 2.8 SD) than for LS infants (3.5 ± 3.5 SD). Daily stool number was higher (p < 0.005) for LS
and lower (p < 0.05) for BiLS infants during supplementation than at Baseline. During supplementation, watery stools
decreased and soft stools increased by 36% over baseline in BiLS infants (p < 0.05) with no significant changes in stool
consistency for the LS infants. None of the safety and tolerability endpoints, including flatulence, bloody stool, body
temperature, ratings of gastrointestinal symptoms, use of antibiotics or gas-relieving medications, infant colic, jaundice,
number of illnesses, sick doctor visits, or diagnoses of eczema were different for the groups at any point.
Conclusions: The B. infantis EVC001 supplement was safely consumed and well-tolerated. Stools were fewer and
better formed in infants in the BiLS group compared with LS group. Adverse events were those expected in healthy
infants and not different between groups.

 Background
Breast milk not only provides nutrition but has evolved to
protect and support development of the vulnerable infant.
Breast milk delivers a wide spectrum of biologically active
molecules that aid in the development and maturation of
the gut, and the innate and acquired immune systems,
and support the growth of protective intestinal micro-
biota. Advances in mass spectrometry have revealed de-
tailed chemical structures of the complex and diverse free
and conjugated glycans in human milk [1]. Specifically,
human milk oligosaccharides (HMO), the third most
abundant component in human milk (~10–20 g/L) [2, 3],
are a group of complex sugars that are non-digestible by
the human infant and support the competitive growth of
protective bifidobacterial strains within the intestine [4].
Bifidobacteria were first identified in the feces of breastfed
infants by Henry Tissier at the Pasteur Institute in 1900
[5]. Recent research has demonstrated that the gut of the
breastfed infant is dominated by strains of Bifidobacterium
until cessation of breastfeeding [6, 7].
Recent breakthroughs in microbiology have led to a de-
tailed description of the natural colonization of a protect-
ive subspecies of Bifidobacterium, (B. infantis) in breastfed
infants, and the role of human milk in delivering complex
HMO as natural prebiotics to selectively enrich the
growth and function of B. infantis. Unlike other bifidobac-
terial strains, B. infantis is unique in its ability to consume
HMO as its sole source of carbon through specific solute
binding proteins, transporters and glycosidic hydrolases
that are encoded in its genome [8–14]. The subsequent
effects of HMO metabolism by B. infantis include its pro-
duction of acetate and lactate; its direct binding to intes-
tinal cells; and its stimulation of anti-inflammatory and
inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines by intestinal cells
[15–18]. In animal models of necretozing enterocolitis
(NEC), B. infantis supplementation was found to attenuate
the inflammation [19] and increase intestinal permeability
[20] associated with NEC.
The dominance of fecal Bifidobacterium and B. infantis
has declined over recent decades in developed countries
[21, 22]. For example, in a U.S. cohort of exclusively
breastfed infants, 30% of the total gut microbiome was
represented by the genus Bifidobacterium, whereas only
13% of total intestinal bifidobacterial populations was
represented by the subspecies B. infantis. On the other
hand, in a trial conducted in Bangladeshi breastfed term
infants, 77% of the total gut microbiome was represented
by the genus Bifidobacterium and 57% was represented by
B. infantis [21].
Differences in postnatal intestinal microbial colonization
may explain in part the higher incidence of immune-
mediated diseases, such as allergy and asthma, in children
born by cesarean section compared with those born vagi-
nally [23–27], and the increase in type 1 diabetes and food
allergies in children in developed countries [28]. Thus, the
early colonization and establishment of a healthy micro-
biome in infancy is critical for establishing life-long health.
One of the main objectives of the Infant Microbiota
Probiotic Intake (IMPRINT) Study was to determine the
safety and tolerability of supplementing breastfed, term
infants with B. infantis EVC001. Although B. infantis
was reported to be well-tolerated when provided to pre-
mature infants, such data have not yet been reported for
healthy term infants [29]. In this Phase I clinical trial,
safety and tolerability were determined by measuring the
changes in infant weight, parental reports of gastrointes-
tinal (GI) symptoms, illnesses, use of antibiotics or gas-
relieving medications, and sick doctor visits throughout
the study duration. Additional outcome measures related
to infant fecal microbial composition were prespecified
in the study protocol and will be reported elsewhere.
Methods
Study population
Between January 2015 and April 2016, healthy women
who were pregnant or who had recently delivered healthy
term infants and lived within Yolo and Sacramento coun-
ties in California were recruited and subsequently pro-
vided written informed consent to enroll in the study.
Enrollment criteria for study participation were based on
limiting the number of confounding variables that could
influence the infant gut microbiome. Inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria for mothers were as follows: women 21 to
45 years of age, in their third trimester of pregnancy or
had delivered an infant within the past 4 days, planned to
exclusively breastfeed their infants for at least the first
3 months postnatal, lived in a developed nation for the
past 10 years, did not plan to administer probiotic supple-
ments to their infants during the study duration unless
they were allocated to the B. infantis group, who had not
been diagnosed with any chronic metabolic disease or
obesity, and who were non-smoking. Medications during
labor, including antibiotics, were recorded but not used as
an exclusion criterion. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for
infants born to qualified mothers included gestational age
at birth ≥37 weeks, birth without medical complications
(such as respiratory distress syndrome, birth defects, and
infection), no exposure to any oral or intravenous antibi-
otics 72 h postnatal, and no consumption of infant for-
mula 24 h prior to the Day 7 postnatal at-home lactation
consultation visit.
Study design
This IMPRINT study was a parallel, partially-randomized,
controlled 2-month trial. The University of California
Davis Institutional Review Board approved all aspects of
the study (IRB #: 631,099). This trial was registered on
ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02457338. Prior to the
Smilowitz et al. BMC Pediatrics  (2017) 17:133

 initiation of the study, three separate randomization
schemes were generated using a random number gener-
ator in Excel. Participants were stratified to one of the
three randomization schemes based on mode of deliver-
y—vaginal delivery, cesarean section (time of membrane
rupture before delivery ≤6 h), or cesarean section (time of
membrane
rupture
before delivery
>6 h).
Stratified
randomization was utilized because mode of delivery, as
well as the time when membranes rupture before cesarean
section delivery, have been shown to influence early infant
intestinal microbial colonization [30]. Randomization to
lactation support alone (LS) or lactation support plus B.
infantis supplementation (BiLS) was in a 1:1 ratio for all
three randomization schemes in blocks of ten. After
receiving informed consent for the infant, the clinical
coordinator assigned enrollment identification numbers
according to the schedule. The first fifteen participants en-
rolled in the study were not included in the stratified
randomization schedule due to unavailability of the B.
infantis product during the trial period. The first eight in-
fants enrolled in the study were assigned to the LS group,
but three had withdrawn or were screen-failed and thus
only five infants received the intervention. The subsequent
seven infants were assigned to the BiLS group, but three
had withdrawn or were screen-failed and thus only four
infants received the intervention. Parity and mode of
delivery were not different between the two assigned
groups for these fifteen participants.
After meeting major postpartum study criteria at
enrollment (Day 3 or 4), infants were randomized into
the BiLS or LS group. On Day 7, infants were screened
for the consumption of infant formula within the past
24 h. On Days 3 or 4, 7, 15, 22, 33, and 61, study
personnel visited mothers’ homes to conduct study proce-
dures. On all six visits, mothers filled out questionnaires
about their and their infants’ health, GI symptoms, occur-
rence of fever, illness, and number and reasons for sick
doctor visits. Mothers collected infant stool samples from
their infants’ diapers before Day 6 (baseline) and on Days
10, 14, 21, 25, 29, 32, 40, 50, and 60 and stored them in
their kitchen freezers. Infant weight was measured by
study personnel with a digital infant scale (Tanita) on Days
33 and 61. Participants received breastfeeding support at
their homes by the study’s internationally board certified
lactation consultant (IBCLC) prenatally and on Days 3 or
4, 7, and 15. On Days 22, 33, and 61 postnatal, study
personnel transported samples from participants’ homes
to the UC Davis campus on dry ice and stored at −80 °C.
Infants randomized into the BiLS group received one
daily serving of B. infantis in their homes for 21 con-
secutive days starting on Day 7 and continuing through
Day 27. During the Day 7 lactation consultation visit,
mothers were trained by their lactation consultant to
mix each B. infantis serving with 5 mL of their breast
milk in a plastic medicine cup, and to syringe or finger-
feed the mixture to their infants. Each daily serving of B.
infantis EVC001 (ATCC accession Number SD-7035)
consisted of one 625-mg sachet, delivering a minimum
156 mg of live bacteria (minimum 1.8 × 1010 CFU) plus
469 mg of lactose as the excipient. The 18 billion CFU
per sachet was the minimum guaranteed CFU count as
determined by the product specification. Because this is
a live microorganism there is potential loss over time.
As such, the sachets were produced with a 50% overage
to account for potential losses during packaging and
long term storage. This means the range of the dose
delivered was 18–28 billion CFU per dose. The product
was stored in the freezer at −20 °C and suffered no loss
from the first infant enrolled to the last infant enrolled.
Mothers received 21 sachets, plus four extra sachets that
were to be used in the event of damage or misplace-
ment. All sachets were kept frozen in mothers’ kitchen
freezers until time of use, and mothers were instructed
to keep all used and unused sachets provided. Compli-
ance was assessed on Days 22 and 33 by counting and
recording the number of empty B. infantis sachets.
Infant stool samples without labeled group assignments
were provided to Evolve BioSystems, Inc. (Davis, CA USA)
for the analysis of total infant fecal Bifidobacterium. Group
assignments were unblinded to Evolve BioSystems, Inc.
post microbial analysis. For DNA extraction, approximately
100 mg of the frozen collected stool samples were extracted
using the Zymo Research Fecal DNA kit, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) amplification was conducted using methods as previ-
ously described, with minor modifications [31]. Briefly,
5 μL of extracted DNA were used as template for a 20-μL
reaction, using primers Bif F (5′-GCGTGCTTAACACAT
GCAAGTC-3′), Bif R (5′- CACCCGTTTCCAGGAGCTA
TT-3′), and Bif P (5′-TCACGCATTACTCACCCGTTC
GCC-3′). Reactions were carried out with Taqman
Universal MasterMix II with Uracil-N glycosylase (Life
Technologies) [31] using a Life Technologies Quant-
Studio 3 Real-Time PCR machine. Samples were assayed in
duplicate. A standard curve was prepared from Bifidobac-
terium longum subsp. infantis EVC001 using the same
extraction protocol as used for the stool samples for quanti-
fication of fecal Bifidobacterium.
Infant gastrointestinal health and tolerability
Infant GI tolerability during B. infantis EVC001 supple-
mentation was assessed by mothers on a daily basis
starting with Day 1 (or retrospectively if mothers were
enrolled on Day 4 postnatal) until Day 61. On each day,
mothers recorded the following information about their
infants in daily logs: consumption of breast milk defined
as suckling at the breast for at least five minutes or con-
suming any volume in a bottle; intake of other liquids or

 solids; amount of infant formula consumed; intake of
probiotics that were not used in the study; intake of any
oral antibiotics or administration of intravenous antibi-
otics; intake of any over-the-counter or prescribed medi-
cations; intake of vitamins, supplements, and herbs;
number of spit-ups—less than five, five to ten, or more
than ten; number of stools; consistency of stools using a
modified Amsterdam infant stool scale—watery, soft,
formed, hard [32] (Additional file 1); blood in the stool;
body temperature above 100.3 °F; ratings of GI-related
symptoms using a continuous scale of 0 (“not notice-
able”) to 10 (“most severe”), including general irritability
(“how irritable was your baby?”), upset (“if your baby
vomited or spit up, how upset was he/she after?”), and
discomfort (“rate your baby’s discomfort in passing stool
or gas”). Mothers also rated the frequency of their in-
fant’s flatulence as “never, sometimes, often, very often”
on a daily basis. Mothers filled out questionnaires to
report any adverse events experienced by their infants
during each at-home visit (Days 7, 15, 22, 33 and 61).
Mothers recorded the following about their infants on
weekly questionnaires: episodes of colic—defined as
crying for more than 3 h per day for at least 3 days per
week [33], eczema diagnosis by a primary-care provider,
number of sick doctor visits, illnesses, and medications
used (Additional file 2).
Statistics
Data from the daily logs and retrospective questionnaires
were binned into three time periods: baseline (Days 1–6),
intervention (Days 7–27), and post-intervention (Days
28–61). For retrospective questionnaires, Day 7 data were
binned as baseline. Means and proportions were calcu-
lated for continuous variables and categorical variables
across all three time periods. Proportions for binary
categorical variables were calculated as number of days
reported/total number of days in each study period, and
number of infants/total number of infants in each inter-
vention group. The calculated values were multiplied by
100 to generate percentages.
For this Phase I study, the sample size was based on
differences in infant fecal B. infantis, which was calcu-
lated using the means and standard deviations from a
previous study on breastfed infants [22]. To detect a
standardized inter-group difference of 1.3 z-scores in
infant fecal B. infantis with 90% power and α = 0.05, as-
suming equal standard deviations with a 20% attrition
rate, 30 infants were needed in each group. Intent-to-
treat analysis was performed of mother-infant dyads
who initiated the study by Day 7 when final screening
criteria were met. Statistical analyses were performed in
IBM SPSS Statistics version 24 and figures were gener-
ated in PRISM v.7. Statistical significance was considered
as p < 0.05. Continuous data were checked visually for
normality with histograms and quintile-quintile plots as
well as numerically with the Shapiro-Wilk test and equality
of variances using Levene’s statistic. Non-normal data were
Log10 transformed and confirmed again for normality prior
to conducting parametric analyses.
To determine differences in total infant fecal Bifidobac-
terium between groups, Mann-Whitney U test was con-
ducted using GraphPad Prism v7. Baseline demographics,
maternal health, pregnancy history, and infant feeding and
GI symptoms were compared between the LS and BiLS
groups using the Pearson Chi-square Test for Independ-
ence (categorical variables), Mann-Whitney U Test, or
one-way ANOVA (continuous variables). For normally-
distributed continuous data, repeated measures ANOVA
was performed with group and time as fixed factors, parity
as the covariate, and group by time as the interaction
term. If time was significant, multiple comparison post-
hoc analysis with Bonferroni correction was carried out to
compare baseline, intervention, and post-intervention
data. Group differences in stool consistency, flatulence,
and spitting-up were analyzed by logistic regression.
Results
Study participation
One-hundred and eight mothers were screened for eligi-
bility to participate in the study. Eighty women met ini-
tial study criteria, of which fifteen were non-randomly
assigned and sixty-five were randomly assigned into the
LS (n = 39) and BiLS (n = 41) groups (Fig. 1). Screen
failures were due to the use of infant formula within
24 h of the Day 7 lactation consultation visit. Mothers
withdrew from study participation for feeling over-
whelmed with a new infant and/or unexpectedly discon-
tinuing breastfeeding due to difficulty with lactation
(n = 8). Sixty-eight mother-infant dyads met final study
criteria. Data for all participants in each group (n = 34
per group) are reported except for the post-intervention
period for the one participant who was enrolled into the
LS group and withdrew on Day 26 postnatal. The overall
attrition rate for this study was 15%, consistent with pro-
biotic studies in healthy, breastfed, term infants [34, 35].
Based on study compliance assessments, of the 21
desired once-daily servings of B. infantis, 94% of the
BiLS infants consumed 20–25 daily servings and 6%
consumed 13–19 daily servings. No infant received more
than one serving per day.
Maternal characteristics
Maternal age at enrollment (Additional file 3: Table S1),
weight gain during pregnancy, time when lactogenesis II
ensued (< 72 h), and time when membranes ruptured
prior to delivery were not significantly different between
the LS and BiLS groups (Additional file 4: Table S2).
However, women enrolled in the BiLS group had a
Smilowitz et al. BMC Pediatrics  (2017) 17:133 
Page 4 of 11
 higher pre-pregnancy BMI than women enrolled in
the LS group (p < 0.05). There were significantly
(p < 0.01) more multiparous women (n = 20, BiLS;
n = 8, LS) in the BiLS group and fewer primiparous
women (n = 14, BiLS; n = 26, LS) compared with the
LS group (Additional file 4: Table S2). These differ-
ences were not a result of the non-random enrollment
of the first fifteen participants.
Infant characteristics
Infant birth weight, birth length, gestational age at birth,
and gender were not different between groups (Table 1).
Infant weight was not different between groups at birth,
or Days 33 and 61 (Additional file 5: Figure S1).
Infant diet
According to maternal reports, the mean number of
breastfeeds at the breast or with breast milk bottles by
their infants was the same for intervention groups at
each time period (Additional file 6: Figure S2). The
number of days, number of infants who were mixed-fed
(consumed some amount of infant formula), or the
mean amount of infant formula consumed were not sig-
nificantly different between the BiLS and LS groups
(Additional file 7: Table S3). One mother in the BiLS
group and two mothers in the LS group reported feeding
her
infant
non-study
probiotics
during
the
post-
intervention period (Additional file 7: Table S3). The
intake of vitamin D by infants was not different between
the intervention groups (data not shown).

 Parity did not influence any of the feeding variables ex-
cept for vitamin D intake during the intervention and
post-intervention periods (p < 0.01 for both). Primiparous
women fed their infants vitamin D 30% of the intervention
period and 38% of the post-intervention period compared
with multiparous mothers feeding only 7% and 6% of the
intervention periods, respectively. Additionally, infant
intake of vitamin D significantly (p < 0.01) increased over
time for both BiLS and LS groups in primiparous
(p < 0.0005) but not multiparous mothers.
Infant gastrointestinal health and tolerability
The number of infant bowel movements during the
baseline period was the same for the BiLS and LS groups
but was significantly (p < 0.0005) different during the
intervention (BiLS: mean, 3.2/d, range, 0.50–7.2; LS:
mean, 5.5/d, range, 2.6–10.6), and post-intervention
(BiLS: mean, 1.7/d, range, 0.30–4.8); LS: mean, 4.4/d,
range, 0.97–9.9) periods (Fig. 2). The mean number of
bowel movements was not only different between groups
(p < 0.01) but also different across time within each
group (p < 0.0005). Parity was unrelated to the reported
mean number of bowel movements per day across all
three time periods. Maternal reports for the proportion
of watery and soft stools during the intervention period
for infants in the BiLS vs. the LS group (0.20 vs. 0.33)
and (0.79 vs. 0.67), respectively, were not statistically
significant (Fig. 3a). Yet, the percentage of watery stools
decreased from baseline to the intervention period by 36%
in infants assigned to the BiLS group (p < 0.05) and only
by 7% in infants assigned to the LS group. As expected,
the percentage of soft stools increased from baseline to
the intervention period by 36% in infants assigned to the
BiLS group (p < 0.05) but only increased by 7% in infants
assigned to the LS group (Fig. 3b). There was no differ-
ence in the change in consistency from intervention to
post-intervention between the groups. Stool consistency
was also not influenced by parity.
Infant illness and adverse events were not different
between BiLS and LS groups (Table 2). The types of

Fig. 2 Number of infant stools per day. Mean ± SD of reported
number of daily infant stools for the LS (red dot plot) and BiLS
(blue dot plot) groups during the Baseline, Intervention, and Post-
intervention periods. n = 34 for each group during the Baseline and
Intervention periods, and n = 33 for the LS, and n = 34 for the BiLS
groups during the Post-intervention period. Different superscripts
represent significant differences within and between interventions.
There was a significant time effect (p < 0.01), time*trt interaction
(p < 0.0005), and intervention effect (p < 0.0005). Based on multiple
comparison post hoc analysis with Bonferroni corrections, compared
with baseline the mean number of stools increased (bp < 0.0005)
during the intervention period for the LS group and decreased
(cp < 0.05) for the BiLS group. During the Post-intervention period,
the mean number of stools returned to Baseline levels for the LS
group and decreased from the Intervention period for the BiLS
group (dp < 0.0005)

 illnesses and reasons for any sick doctor visits reported
by mothers are shown in Additional file 8: Table S4.
None of the infants in the BiLS group received antibi-
otics; two infants in the LS group received intravenous
antibiotics (at birth and Days 10–18). The number of
spit-ups per day as less than five, five to ten, and more
than ten were not significantly different at any time
period between the two groups (Additional file 9:
Figure S3). There were no differences in mean irrit-
ability scores (Fig. 4a), mean scores for discomfort
after spit-ups (Fig. 4b), or mean scores for discomfort
when passing gas or stool (Fig. 4c) between the groups at
any time period. Interestingly, maternal parity was signifi-
cantly associated with rating of irritability. Higher irritability
scores were rated by primiparous than multiparous
mothers during the baseline period (2.6 and 1.3, respect-
ively, p < 0.01) and intervention period (2.5 and 1.7, re-
spectively, p < 0.05) but not during the post-intervention
period. There were no differences in infant flatulence
between groups (Additional file 10: Figure S4).
Fecal Bifidobacterium
To correlate safety endpoints with the supplementation
of B. infantis EVC001 and colonization of the genus Bifi-
dobacterium in the infant gut, we compared the mean
differences for total fecal Bifidobacterium from baseline
to the end of the supplementation period for the LS and
BiLS groups. The mean Log10 change in total fecal Bifi-
dobacterium from Day 6 to Day 28 was significantly

Discussion
The hygiene hypothesis suggests that changes in coloniz-
ing microbes related to a developed or Western lifestyle
have long-term impacts on the risks of developing aller-
gic, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases [21–28]. In
an effort to shift the intestinal microbiome toward bene-
ficial populations in early infancy, the Infant Microbiota
Probiotic Intake (IMPRINT) Study was designed to
determine the safety and tolerability in breastfed term
infants supplemented with B. infantis. We found that B.
infantis EVC001 was well-tolerated and safely consumed
by healthy term infants for 21 consecutive days. All
adverse events reported by mothers enrolled in the study
were typical of infants this age and the incidences were
not increased by the B. infantis feedings.
To assess infant GI function as a metric of tolerability,
mothers recorded the number of bowel movements and
the consistency of the first bowel movement produced
by their infants each day during the two-month study
period. Based on daily reports, the mean number of
bowel movements passed by infants in both groups are
consistent with other reports on the frequency of bowel
movements in breastfed infants. The number of bowel
movements in breastfed infants has been found to be
highly variable and to decrease with postnatal age, with
a mean of about 4 per day and a median of about 4 per
day and a range of 0.3 to 8.5 per day during the first
month of age [36–40]; and a mean of 1.8 per day and
median of 1.8 per day at 5 months of age [36–42]. Thus,
the frequency in bowel movements of infants in the LS
and BiLS groups was within normal a range.
The infants in the BiLS group passed fewer daily stools
than infants in the LS group. Additionally, infants in the
BiLS group were reported to pass “soft” stools more
often and “watery” stools less often compared with in-
fants in the LS group. These data may reflect maturation
of the gut in response to B. infantis supplementation.
Compared with other reports, the LS group produced
bowel movements more similar to one-month-old in-
fants, and the BiLS group produced bowel movements
more similar to three-month-old infants [36, 38]. In
infants, a reduction in stool frequency and increase in
stool firmness has been found to be associated with post-
natal age and with the maturation of the gut [32, 36, 38].
In addition to infant age and diet [36, 39], stool consistency
was recently reported to be associated with the intestinal
bacterial species richness, enterotypes (or microbial
classification), and community composition in adults
[43]. We found a 1000-fold higher change in total
fecal Bifidobacterium from baseline to the end of the
supplementation period in infants supplemented with
B. infantis EVC001 compared with unsupplemented
infants. The changes in total fecal Bifidobacterium are
biologically relevant and can logically be attributed to the
supplementation of B. infantis EVC001. We hypothesize
that supplementation of infants with B. infantis facilitates
maturation
of
the
gut
mucosa.
This
hypothesis
is
supported by the findings that intestinal Bifidobacterium
and B. infantis increase the mRNA expression of intestinal
epithelial tight junction proteins [15], enhance intestinal
barrier function through the production of acetate [44],
and promote the maturation of dendritic cells in intestinal
Peyer’s Patches [45].
To investigate overall GI tolerability, mothers were asked
to rate their infants’ general irritability, upset feelings after

 spitting-up, and discomfort when passing gas or stool on a
daily basis throughout the two-month study period. Gener-
ally, reports of infants’ general irritability, upset feelings,
and discomfort scores were low and not different between
the groups. Interestingly, maternal parity was significantly
associated with rating irritability during the baseline and
intervention but not the post-intervention period. Mean
infant irritability scores were higher by primiparous than
multiparous mothers, reflecting an over-assessment of
infant behavior in first-time mothers [46]. The number of
days blood in stool was present, number of daily spit-ups,
and daily flatulence frequency were not different between
the groups. Adverse events occurred in both groups based
on evaluation of the presence of colic, number of sick
doctor visits, illnesses, eczema diagnoses by a primary care
providers, and use of antibiotics or gas-relieving medica-
tions. The types of events, however, were normal for infants
of this age, were not serious in nature, and the incidence of
adverse events was not greater in the BiLS group than in
the LS group. The adverse events were not deemed related
to the study procedures or feeding of B. infantis.
One limitation of our study was that a placebo was
not supplied for the control arm and subjects were not
blinded to their treatment assignment. Although these
measures are critical for larger efficacy studies, they are
not imperative for small Phase I trials. At the time the
study was initiated, a placebo was not feasible, however
we have recently identified a safe placebo that would not
elicit a prebiotic effect in infants and feasible for future
trials. Another limitation is a potential source of bias
with the involvement of the clinical coordinator in allo-
cating group assignments at enrollment. This was due to
limited resources in using a neutral third party for
randomization. Bias was checked weekly by the principal
investigator to ensure the clinical coordinator had allo-
cated group assignments in chronological order and
according to the randomization scheme that was created
prior to study initiation. Another limitation was that
mothers were instructed to assess stool consistency by
comparing their infants’ bowel movements with images
of
four
typical
stool
consistencies.
Assessing
stool
consistency by appearance using a 4-point system is sub-
jective, and more objective metrics of stool quality are
needed in the clinical setting. Furthermore, in contrast
with studies in adolescents [47], the infant stool scale
used in this study has not been correlated with colonic
transit time [32], making interpretation with GI function
challenging. Another limitation was that mothers were
not instructed to report the amount of infant stool pro-
duced, which has been found to be a reliable metric of
GI maturation [32]. We did not include bowel move-
ment size because of difficulty in assessing the amount
of stool as a percentage of total surface on the diaper
due to the excellent absorbency of today’s disposable
diapers. Lastly, balancing the number of primiparous
and multiparous women would have better controlled
confounding effects of assessing infant symptoms.
