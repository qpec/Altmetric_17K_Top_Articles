Guidelines for low back pain (LBP) often recommend the use of
self-management such as unsupervised exercise, booklets, and
online education. Another potentially useful way for patients to
self-manage LBP is by using smartphone applications (apps).
However, to date, there has been no rigorous evaluation of LBP
apps and no guidance for consumers on how to select high-quality,
evidence-based apps. This chapter reviews smartphone apps for
the self-management of LBP and evaluates their content quality
and whether they recommend evidence-based interventions.
This chapter shows that generally app developers are selecting
interventions that are endorsed by guidelines, although their
quality is low. There are many apps available for the self-
management of LBP, but their effectiveness in improving patient
outcomes has not been rigorously assessed. App developers need

Introduction
Low back pain (LBP) is a major global public health issue and the leading cause of disability in most
countries according to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 [1]. Guidelines for LBP often recommend
the use of self-management [2], which is broadly described as patients being proactive in employing
strategies to manage and monitor their own health and well-being [3]. Examples of self-management
strategies for LBP include unsupervised exercise, booklets, and online education (e.g., websites) [4,5]. A
potentially useful way for patients to self-manage their health condition is by using smartphone appli-
cations (“apps”). To date, there has been no rigorous evaluation of apps for the self-management of LBP
and no guidance for consumers on how to select high-quality, evidence-based LBP apps.
There are over 165,000 apps available from the iTunes and Google Play stores, and nearly a quarter
of these address the management of health-related disorders [6]. Given the minimum regulatory
control over their content [7,8], consumers and clinicians should question whether the content in these
apps is based on current best practice guidelines [9]. Consumers may rely on in-app or online user
ratings and reviews to select an app, but this information is subject to bias, which means consumers
may struggle to make informed decisions. One method of assessing the quality and “fitness-for-pur-
pose” of apps is by using validated scales and benchmarking app content against current best practice
guidelines [10]. A number of systematic reviews have evaluated the quality and content of apps that
help patients manage various health conditions, such as diabetes, concussion, bipolar disorders, and
depression [11e15]. However, to date, there have been no reviews focusing on apps for managing LBP.
Given the large number of publicly available apps for the self-management of LBP, it is prudent and
timely to evaluate their quality and ascertain whether they reflect current best practice guideline
recommendations.
The purpose of this review was to identify apps for the self-management of LBP and assess their
quality (e.g., functionality, design) and content (compliance with best practice guidelines) to help
consumers make informed decisions.
Methods
This systematic review follows standard recommendations for traditional reviews outlined in the
PRISMA statement [16]. First, we constructed a search strategy using prespecified eligibility criteria and
performed an initial screening of all apps and a full review of relevant apps. Following this, we
extracted the data and assessed the quality of the included apps using a reliable tool (see below)
specifically designed for mobile health apps. The review protocol was prospectively registered on the
PROSPERO Register of Systematic Reviews: CRD42016048420. As no personal data were collected as
part of this review, ethical approval was not required for this study.
Search strategy
The Australian iTunes and Google Play stores were searched for apps related to the self-
management of LBP in November 2016. Together, these two online app stores have more than 4.8
million apps available for download [17,18] and account for 97% of the Australian smartphone market
[19]. We used three keywords recommended by the Cochrane Back and Neck Group [20] used in
traditional systematic reviews of LBP interventions: “low back pain,” “back pain,” and “lumbago.” Two
reviewers (GCM and MBP) performed the initial screening independently on the basis of the name and
description of apps. Apps that met the inclusion criteria were then downloaded onto their devices

 (iPhone 6 iOS 10.0.2 and ASUS ZenFone 2 Android 6.0) for full review. Disagreements regarding in-
clusion were resolved by consensus.
Inclusion criteria
Apps were included if they were in English, were available to the general public, and were a self-
contained product (i.e., did not require add-ons or an external device). No limitations on the costs of
apps were applied. Only apps created or updated in 2015e2017 were included because a recent update
ensures software functionality and ongoing technical support. The focus of the study was to include
apps specifically developed for the self-management of LBP. Although self-management is considered a
broad construct [3], we only included apps that clearly offered at least one treatment option that
encouraged patients to be actively involved in the management of their condition such as unsupervised
exercise programs. We also included apps that taught patients skills to be used during their daily
management through advice or educational interventions, which are important components of self-
management of LBP [21]. However, apps providing only general information about LBP (e.g., com-
mon risk factors, lower back anatomy) were excluded because these apps do not provide a specific
treatment plan to be followed. Additionally, we excluded apps aimed at identifying risk factors, or
prevention or those focused on diagnostic tests of LBP. We also excluded apps that were developed for
healthcare practitioners and those that offered treatments for pregnancy-related LBP, sciatica, other
health conditions, or general health and well-being. Where the same app was available on different
platforms (iOS or Android), the iOS version of the app was kept for inclusion and analysis. When both
paid and free versions of an app were available, we included only the paid version. If the free app
offered in-app purchases, we evaluated the full content of the app.
Data extraction and analysis
Two independent reviewers (GCM and MBP) used an electronic spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel 2010,
Redmond, WA, USA) to extract relevant information from the included apps. The information extracted
included name of the app, version, developer, update date, cost, presence of in-app purchases, and
platform availability. When available, we extracted the number of consumer reviews and rating (5-star
rating system). We also extracted information on the type of intervention offered in the included apps.
Disagreements relating to the categories assigned to each app were resolved by consensus.
Content and quality assessment
We used the recently published National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for
LBP to identify whether the included apps provided evidence-based interventions (categorized as “yes/
no”) [22]. For this, we mapped app interventions to recommendations listed in the NICE guidelines. This
guideline provides the most recent best practice recommendations for the assessment and management
of LBP andsciatica inpeople aged 16 orolder. The NICE guidelines reviewed theevidence fora broad range
of interventions, used individually or in combination, ranging from advice and noninvasive interventions
to injections and surgery. NICE guideline recommendations are based on the quality of the underpinning
evidence and a trade-off between the benefits and harms of an intervention [22].
A trained reviewer (GCM or MBP) assessed the quality of apps that provided evidence-based in-
terventions using the mobile application rating scale (MARS) [23]. MARS is a 23-item questionnaire,
each question containing a five-point response scale (1-inadequate, 2-poor, 3-acceptable, 4-good, and
5-excellent). The items are categorized into five domains: engagement (fun, interesting, customizable,
interactive, and well-targeted to audience), functionality (functioning, easy to learn, navigation, logic
flow, and gestural design of app), aesthetics (graphic design, overall visual appeal, color scheme, and
stylistic consistency), information quality (quality and quantity of information, credibility of devel-
oper), and a general, overall quality scale. MARS has shown excellent internal consistency
(alpha ¼ 0.90) and inter-rater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC ¼ 0.79) [23].
As a reliability check for the MARS ratings, 20 randomly selected apps were independently assessed
by a second reviewer (GCM, MBP, or HL) [23]. We then calculated the inter-rater reliability (ICC2,1) of

 the MARS total score, and if ICC values were greater than 0.85, we considered the agreement between
reviewers as excellent, and no further consensus was performed. In addition to the MARS total score,
we used MARS item 15 specifically (“is app content correct, well written, and relevant to the goal/topic
of the app?”) to assess the quality of the information provided and whether the app content was
appropriate for LBP. MARS item 18 was used to evaluate the credibility and trustworthiness of the app
developer. Finally, MARS item 19 was used to assess whether the app has been tested in randomized
controlled trials, and we scored this item by searching the name of the app on Google Scholar. The three
highest-scoring apps using the MARS scale are described in more detail in the Results section.
Classification of exercise interventions
Given that most of the apps for the self-management of LBP focused on exercise interventions, we
classified them according to the categories proposed in the NICE guidelines:
� Biomechanical exercises: exercise interventions primarily directed at altering or improving spinal
mechanics (e.g., muscle strengthening, stretching, range of motion exercises, motor control exer-
cises, Pilates, or the McKenzie method).
� Aerobic exercises: exercise interventions directed at improving cardiovascular fitness and endur-
ance (e.g., running, walking).
� Mindebody exercises: exercise interventions that combine physical, mental, and spiritual focus
(e.g., Yoga, Tai Chi, and mindfulness).
� Mixed modality exercises: exercise interventions that incorporate any combination of the previous
three categories.
Data analysis
The characteristics of the included apps were summarized as means or medians for continuous data
and as frequencies and proportions for categorical data. We used multivariable regression analysis to
investigate whether the quality of apps (MARS total score) was associated with in-app customer rating
(5-star system) and the price of apps. We ranked the apps providing evidence-based interventions
using the MARS scale total score. We used STATA v14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) for all analyses.
Results
Search results
Our search on the iTunes and Google Play stores yielded 723 apps. After the initial screening based
on the name and the app description, 612 apps were excluded. The primary reasons for exclusion at this
stage were as follows: apps were targeted for healthcare providers and apps were not targeting pa-
tients with LBP. We downloaded 110 apps for a full evaluation based on our inclusion criteria, and
further 49 apps were excluded. Of these, over one-third (19/49, 39%) were excluded because they were
not updated since 2015, and another 16/49 (33%) were excluded because they provided only general
information, which was not considered a self-management intervention for LBP. Finally, 61 apps were
included in this review (Fig. 1).
Characteristics of included apps
Of the 61 apps included in this review, 24 (39%) were found on iTunes exclusively, 33 (54%) on
Google Play exclusively, and 4 (7%) were found on both app stores. Six apps had two versions available
for download: a paid (or “pro”) version and a free (or “lite”) version; in these cases, the paid versions of
these apps were included in the review. There were 22 (36%) paid apps, ranging in price from AUD
$0.99 to AUD $14.99 (median AUD $1.99). Of the 39 (64%) free apps, 6 offered in-app purchases with
prices ranging from AUD $0.99 to AUD $17.99. Only 25 (41%) apps were reviewed by customers, on a 5-

 star rating system; the median customer rating was 3.8 stars (range, 1e5). The number of reviews per
app ranged from 0 reviews for 35 apps to 374 reviews for 1 app (Back Pain Relief Yoga Posese17.0). The
characteristics of each app are presented in the online appendix.
Interventions for LBP
The included apps recommended a range of interventions (Table 1). Only three apps recommended
interventions not endorsed by the NICE guidelines: Brainwave Entrainment (Backache Reliefe1.0),
Qigong exercises (Qigong for Back Pain Reliefe1.0.1), and Graded Motor Imagery (Recognise Backe1.1).
Of the 31 apps recommending biomechanical exercises, 2 (3%) offered strengthening exercises alone,14
(23%) offered strengthening exercises in combination with stretching (23%), and the remaining 15
(25%) recommended a combination of interventions, such as core stability, Pilates, and McKenzie

 exercises. There were 17 (28%) apps offering mindebody exercises (Yoga) as a self-management
strategy for LBP. Four (7%) apps prescribed combinations of aerobic, biomechanical, and mindebody
exercises.
Only 6 (10%) apps provided some type of educational intervention for LBP in combination with an
exercise program, an approach that is more closely aligned with the NICE guidelines recommendations.
Quality assessment
The agreement between reviewers using the MARS scale to assess the quality of the included
apps was excellent (ICC2,1 ¼ 0.91). The mean MARS total score was 2.36 (SD, 0.83) on a 0e5 scale.
Most apps rated poorly on customer interest, interactivity, and customization; the mean MARS
engagement subscale score was 1.61 (SD, 0.52). The mean MARS aesthetics subscale score was 2.46
(SD, 1.01) because apps generally presented unattractive layouts and low-resolution graphics.
Overall, the included apps had low-quality information from a questionable source (i.e., legitimacy/
trustworthiness of source unknown or not verified) and received a mean MARS information subscale
score of 2.55 (SD, 0.65). The included apps were mostly functional, easy to learn how to use, and had
a logical flow; the mean MARS functionality subscale score was 3.48 (SD, 0.91). The mean quality of
information (item 15) and credibility of the developer (item 18) were low, scoring 2.4 (SD, 0.8) and
1.9 (SD, 0.7), respectively. None of the apps had been trialed or tested in the published scientific
literature (item 19). Table 2 presents the assessment of the quality of individual apps by using the
MARS scale.
Highest scoring apps for LBP
The three highest scoring apps for the self-management of LBP all recommended biomechanical
exercises (e.g., strengthening, stretching, core stability, or McKenzie exercises). They were found to be
interesting, entertaining, interactive, and customizable and had a high level of visual appeal and
content. All the apps were paid or required in-app purchases to fully access their content:
� “Lower Back Pain Appe2.2”: This app had the highest total MARS score (mean 3.94) and was
developed by a physiotherapist. Consumers answer three screening questions (e.g., presence of leg
pain, constant nightly pain, and history of recent accidents or injuries). If the answer is “yes” to any
of the questions, a warning message recommends patients to seek a medical doctor. Before starting
the exercise program, patients are asked to indicate the amount of pain they are experiencing
(visual analog scale, 0e10). This question is repeated in weeks 3 and 10. The app offers a 10-week
exercise program, each week consisting of three exercises that should be performed twice daily. The
exercises focus on spinal mobility, stability, and muscle strengthening and are accompanied by a
text description and high-resolution instructional videos (cost: AUD $1.49 on iTunes).
� “3 Steps to Cure Back Paine1.1”: This app was the second highest scoring app according to the MARS
scale (3.83) and was developed by a pain specialist. The app is based on a three-step rehabilitation
method containing a series of videos consisting of (1) education and advice, (2) McKenzie exercises
for pain relief, and (3) general exercises for muscle strengthening (cost: free, in-app purchases: AUD
$17.99 on iTunes).
� “Backachee2.0.6”: This app had a mean total MARS score of 3.78, being the third highest scoring
app in this review. It contains a program of 31 exercises designed by a physiotherapist. The app uses
high-resolution videos and texts to describe the exercises, and users can select how often the app
prompts them with a reminder to perform them (cost: AUD $5.99 on iTunes/Android).
Multivariable regression analysis
Twenty-five apps were included in our multivariable regression analysis because they were the only
apps with online customer rating. The total MARS score was used as a dependent variable, while
pricing and customer rating were included as independent variables. Our results revealed that a higher
price was associated with better app quality (coefficient ¼ 0.26, p ¼ 0.003), and customer rating was

 not a predictor of better app quality (coefficient ¼ 0.15, p ¼ 0.189). These two features explained 37.4%
(adjusted-R2 ¼ 0.374, n ¼ 25, F ¼ 8.17, p ¼ 0.002) of the variation of total MARS scores.
Discussion
Summary of findings
This review used a systematic approach to identify apps developed to help patients self-manage
their LBP. Our results showed that there are numerous apps available for consumers with LBP on
both iTunes and Google Play stores. Nearly, all apps recommended some type of intervention listed in
the NICE guidelines. However, the overall quality of these apps was low because they lacked engaging
features, presented unattractive layouts, and provided questionable and low-quality information. In
general, the apps with the highest quality scores were also the most expensive ones. However, none
have been tested for effectiveness in reducing the symptoms of LBP.
Comparison with similar studies
Although a review for LBP has not been previously conducted, there has been a surge in reviews
investigating the quality of apps for other health conditions. Examples include diabetes [24], weight
loss [11], mental health [12,15], speech disorders [25], and cardiovascular diseases [26]. Given the
increasing number of health apps available to consumers, it is imperative to assess their content quality
and to benchmark the interventions against best practice guidelines
Q1
.
Apps could be an accessible and cost-effective alternative to help patients manage their LBP.
Although most apps included in this review offered evidence-based interventions, it is unclear whether
providing the evidence-based intervention through an app is effective. Currently, none of the available
apps for LBP have been tested in a randomized controlled trial. This was made apparent through the
assessment of MARS item 19, which assesses whether the app has been trialed or tested. Thus, the
effectiveness of these apps remains unknown. The rapid rate at which app technologies emerge and
adapt imposes challenges (e.g., rapid dissemination and update of apps) to the evaluation of their
effectiveness by using the traditional randomized controlled trial method [27,28]. Nonetheless, it is
crucial that apps for LBP are evaluated by using robust research methods. Studies such as the ones
planned by Bl€
odt et al. [29], which aim to investigate the effectiveness of an app-based relaxation
management strategy for patients with LBP, provide an example and will be important for generating
an evidence base. A possible intermediate step to testing LBP app effectiveness would be to conduct
studies to better understand their validity and user acceptance.
Strengths and weaknesses
The strengths of this review include the use of key features of a traditional systematic review
methodology (prospective protocol registration, systematic search, independent study screening, data
extraction, and quality assessment using a reliable and validated scale). This rigorous methodology

Please cite this article in press as: Machado GC, et al., Smartphone apps for the self-management of low
back pain: A systematic review, Best Practice & Research Clinical Rheumatology (2017), http://dx.doi.org/

 provided a robust framework for evaluating the LBP apps included in the study. Additionally, we
selected a random sample of 20 apps for quality agreement evaluation, and we found excellent inter-
rater reliability (ICC2,1 ¼ 0.91). Furthermore, we attempted to benchmark the content of the included
apps against the most recently published best practice guideline for the management of LBP (NICE
guidelines) [22]. We also provided consumer-friendly information about the three highest-scoring
apps in this review according to the MARS scale.
This review has some limitations. The last update date of many apps preceded the publication of the
NICE guidelines for LBP. However, most of the recommendations listed on the current guideline were
already included in previous versions of the NICE guidelines for LBP [30]. Furthermore, although the
NICE guidelines provide a list of recommendations based on the costs of interventions, there was
uncertainty about the cost-effectiveness of interventions offered by the included apps. Therefore, the
NICE recommendations used in this review do not reflect the trade-off between net clinical effects and
costs. We excluded apps that had not been updated since 2015 as regular app updates are important to
guarantee app functionality and associated customer support. Our decision to exclude apps that were
not specifically targeted for the self-management of LBP may have resulted in the omission of other
apps, which may have been of a higher quality. This decision was driven by our assumption that
consumers are more likely to search and choose apps that are specific to their condition, rather than
generic apps that target several conditions. For practical reasons relating to data-capturing capacity,
our search was limited to the Australian iTunes and Google Play stores; therefore, apps that are
exclusively available in other countries were not included in this review.
Interpretation and implications of results
Smartphone app developers could use the results of this review when developing or updating apps
for the self-management of LBP. Generally, our results suggest that app developers are selecting in-
terventions that are endorsed by guidelines when creating LBP apps. However, the quality of these apps
is low, and therefore, app developers need to work closely with the medical community, specialists in
the field, and researchers to ensure app content is accurate and evidence based. We also suggest
involving patients during the app development process to facilitate end-user engagement. Speaking to
patients and gauging what features do and do not work for them will enable the creation of content
that is likely to be more engaging and user friendly. The Australian Victorian Health Promotion
Foundation recently published a guide for people interested in developing evidence-based and
effective health apps [31]. The guide provides detailed instructions for each stage of the app devel-
opment process, from planning to launching the app. This guide could potentially benefit the devel-
opment of future LBP apps.
We found that app quality is not associated with in-app or online user ratings. Thus, we suspect that
user ratings are invalid indicators of app quality and thus should not guide app selection. The quality
assessment revealed that the apps scored the lowest on the “engagement” domain (mean 1.61, SD
0.52). This was partly because most apps did not use specific strategies to increase engagement (e.g.,
entertainment). To overcome this limitation, apps for LBP should incorporate strategies that would
stimulate repeat use; examples might include through gamification or reward systems. The low scores
on MARS items 15 and 18 revealed inconsistencies in the quality and trustworthiness of information
presented in included apps.
Currently, the content of mobile health apps is poorly regulated [32]. Therefore, the results of this
review are crucial to help consumers choose the most appropriate app currently available for LBP.
Although it is unclear whether healthcare professionals recommend LBP apps for their patients, our
study could potentially help professionals make informed recommendations.
Conclusions
The popularity of health apps is sharply increasing, and they are potentially promising tools to help
reduce the burden of LBP; however, apps for the self-management of LBP are of poor quality. Although
we identified and describe three apps that are of good quality, with recommendations that align with
guideline-based care, there is no evidence that these apps are effective in improving patient outcomes

 because their effectiveness has not been investigated. Consumers and health professionals should be
aware of the low quality of most apps currently available for LBP. Health professionals, researchers, and
industry partners (e.g., start-up companies) need to engage more with app developers to devise ways
to appropriately evaluate these emerging technologies to ensure that they are beneficial to patients.
Summary
Online technologies, such as smartphone apps, can help us manage our health, and they are
influencing healthcare in new and exciting ways. Our aim was to evaluate the quality of smartphone
apps for the self-management of LBP and assess whether these apps recommend evidence-based
interventions.
We searched iTunes and Google Play stores in November 2016 for apps designed for the self-
management of LBP. Two independent reviewers screened the retrieved apps for eligibility and
extracted data. The 2016 NICE guidelines were used to identify whether interventions recommended
by the included apps were evidence-based. Apps that recommended evidence-based interventions
were rated for quality by using the MARS scale.
We identified 723 apps, of which 61 were included in the review. There were 39 free apps, and the
median cost for 22 paid apps was AUD $1.99 (range, $0.99e$14.99). All but three apps recommended at
least one guideline-endorsed intervention, but none were tested in a randomized controlled trial.
Generally, apps were of low quality with a mean MARS total score of 2.36 (on a 0e5 scale). Apps
generally lacked engaging and customizable features, offered poor quality information, and had poor
visual appeal and questionable credibility. There are many apps available for the self-management of
LBP. Although most of them recommend interventions that are endorsed by clinical practice guidelines,
few are of high quality. Most importantly, the validity and the effectiveness of these apps on patient-
relevant outcomes have not been rigorously assessed.
Conflict of interest statement
None declared.
Practice points
� Despite a large number of publically available apps for the self-management of LBP, there is
minimum regulatory control over their content, and no independent guidance for con-
sumers, leaving them vulnerable to select substandard apps.
� Of the 61 included apps, nearly all (58 apps) recommended LBP interventions endorsed by
clinical practice guidelines. However, the overall quality of the information provided was low.
� Importantly, none of the apps were evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. That being the
case, there are strong concerns as to whether any are effective in improving symptoms in
people with LBP.
Research agenda
� App developers should use the results presented in this review as a guide to improve the
quality of existing apps for LBP.
� To optimize the utility of apps in managing LBP, future studies should focus on generating
deeper understandings of the validity and user acceptance of apps and their features.
� There is a need to test the effectiveness for patient-relevant outcomes of available and newly
developed LBP apps using robust research methods.
