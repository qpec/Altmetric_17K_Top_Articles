Key Points
• Acute GVHD leads to
defective MHC class II
antigen presentation by
donor DC, leading to a
failure of peripheral Treg
homeostasis.
• Impaired Treg homeostasis
results in chronic GVHD
directly and can be alleviated
by adoptive Treg transfer.
Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a major cause of late mortality following
allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and is characterized by tissue fibrosis
manifesting as scleroderma and bronchiolitis obliterans. The development of acute
GVHD (aGVHD) is a powerful clinical predictor of subsequent cGVHD, suggesting that
aGVHD may invoke the immunologic pathways responsible for cGVHD. In preclinical
models in which sclerodermatous cGVHD develops after a preceding period of mild
aGVHD, we show that antigen presentation within major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) class II of donor dendritic cells (DCs) is markedly impaired early after BMT. This
is associated with a failure of regulatory T-cell (Treg) homeostasis and cGVHD. Donor
DC-restricted deletion of MHC class II phenocopied this Treg deficiency and cGVHD.
Moreover, specific depletion of donor Tregs after BMT also induced cGVHD, whereas
adoptive transfer of Tregs ameliorated it. These data demonstrate that the defect in Treg
homeostasis seen in cGVHD is a causative lesion and is downstream of defective antigen
presentation within MHC class II that is induced by aGVHD. (Blood. 2016;128(6):794-804)
Introduction
Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is an effective curative
therapy for the majority of hematologic malignancies. The curative
property of BMT lies mainly the immune-mediated graft-versus-
leukemia effect, which eradicates residual recipient leukemia by T and
natural killer (NK) cells.1,2 The wider application of this treatment is
limited by serious posttransplantation complications, including graft-
versus-host disease (GVHD). GVHD occurs in both acute (aGVHD)
and chronic forms (cGVHD) and develops when the donor graft
recognizes the recipient as foreign and elicits an immune response.
Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilized peripheral
blood (G-CSF PB) is now the predominant stem cell source for al-
logeneic BMT despite the clear association with a significant increase
in incidence and severity of cGVHD.3 Unfortunately there are few
effective therapies available for cGVHD; thus, an enhanced un-
derstanding of the pathophysiology of cGVHD is required to allow the
rational development of new therapeutics.
The induction of acute and chronic forms of GVHD differs
temporally and mechanistically. cGVHD manifests as a diverse range
ofmultiorgan pathologies; however,the skin,mouth,liver,and eyes are
most commonly affected.4 cGVHD presents with features common to
autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and
systemic sclerosis in which pathology is characterized by fibrosis.5 In
contrast, the defining feature of aGVHD is apoptosis. The most
powerful predictor of cGVHD is preceding aGVHD, although it can
also manifest in patients who have not displayed prior aGVHD.6
Although aGVHD is critically dependent on alloreactive donor
T cells contained within the graft, their contribution to cGVHD is
less clear, and there is evidence for a role for autoreactive T cells
in the process.7-11
Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play an important role in the control of
innate and adaptive immune responses. The absence or dysfunction of
Tregs is known to lead to the development of autoimmune diseases,12
anditisproposedthataperturbationofthispopulationcontributestothe

of Tregs in the donor graft has been inversely correlated with aGVHD
both clinically and in preclinical animal models.13-16 Furthermore,
in both preclinical and clinical studies, cGVHD is associated with
decreased numbers of circulating Tregs.17-20 However, the factors con-
tributing to diminished Treg numbers in the setting of cGVHD and the
mechanism by which their absence contributes to pathology remain

From 
 to be elucidated, although enhanced Treg proliferation and Fas-
dependent cell death clearly contribute.20
A role for conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) in the induction
and maintenance of Tregs in general is well established,21 and the
importance of donor DC interactions with Treg after transplant has
recently been reported.22,23 Previous studies from our laboratory have
identified cDC as the critical donor antigen-presenting cell (APC) for
host antigen presentation after transplant and that this contributes to
the perpetuation of aGVHD.24-26 Recently, we demonstrated a specific
impairment in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II
antigen presentation by cDC is induced by the inflammatory cytokine
milieu generated during aGVHD.27 In contrast to our increasing ap-
preciation of the contribution of donor cDC to aGVHD, their role in
cGVHD remains relatively unexplored. We hypothesized that the
failure ofdonor MHCclass II antigen presentation by cDCs may lead to
a failure in Treg development late after transplant, resulting in a loss
of tolerance and cGVHD.
Methods
Stem cell transplantation
On day 0,recipientmicereceived1100 (B6D2F1), 1000 (B6), or 900cGy(FVB/
N) totalbodyirradiation (TBI) split into 2doses separated by 3 hours. Onday22
prior to TBI, FVB/N mice were treated with NK cell depletion (1 mg NK1.1
intraperitoneally). T-cell depletion (TCD) of donor bone marrow (BM) cells and
purification of splenic CD31 T cells were performed as previously described,28
generating TCD BM with ,1% contaminating CD31 T cells and CD31 T-cell
preparations of .85% purity. Recipients were transplanted with 5 3 106

B6.CD11c.OVA, B6.H2-Ab12/2, B6.CD11c Creneg, or I-Ab flox/flox xCD11c-
Cre (I-AbCD11c-Crepos) and B6 or BALB/c.FoxP3-DTR-GFP donor mice as
indicated, with or without supplementation with CD31 T cells from the same
donors or, where indicated, from B6.FoxP3-luc1 or B6.luc1 donors. Trans-
planted mice were monitored daily, and those with GVHD clinical scores29 $6
were killed, and the date of death registered as the next day in accordance with
institutional animal ethics committee guidelines.
Treg depletion and transfers in vivo
From day 14 after BMT, recipients were injected intraperitoneally with 100 ng
diphtheria toxin (DT; Sigma-Aldrich) twice weekly (Tuesday and Friday) for
6weeks.BALB/c(CD45.11)splenicCD41Tcellswerepurifiedusingmagnetic
activated cells sorting (Miltenyi Biotec). Tregs were then sorted on the basis of
CD41, CD251, and 7AAD2 expression using the FACSAria (BD Bioscience).
The postsort purity was .95% FoxP31 and each recipient received 0.5 3 106
sorted cells intravenously.
In vivo bioluminescence imaging
Anesthetized mice were injected with firefly luciferin (500 mg; Caliper Life
Sciences) subcutaneously and imaged 5 minutes later with the Xenogen imaging
system (Xenogen IVIS 100; Caliper Life Sciences). Data were analyzed with

Results
Chronic GVHD is associated with reduced Treg numbers and
immune suppression
The pathophysiology of cGVHD is complex and shares features with
autoimmune diseases. cGVHD can be preceded by aGVHD; however,
it does also manifest in patients who have not displayed symptoms of
aGVHD (so called de novo cGVHD). We first established models of
cGVHD in which sclerodermatous pathology developed in the skin late
after transplant following a period of low-level aGVHD. In the first
model, using BALB/c donors and C57BL/6 recipients (Figure 1A), a
lower dose of donor T cells (2 3 106) was introduced in the graft and
compared with a higher T-cell dose (5 3 106) established to induce
aGVHD morbidity and mortality. Recipients of lower-dose T cells
demonstrated mild to moderate aGVHD with clinical scores between
2 and 4 from day 14 following BMT (Figure 1B) with no associated
mortality(datanotshown).Incontrast,allrecipientsof the higherT-cell
dose succumbed to GVHD by day 30, whereas recipients of grafts
devoid of T cells (non-GVHD controls) did not develop GVHD and
survived long term. As clinical cGVHD is associated with a defect in
Tregs, we quantified the frequency and absolute number of splenic
CD41FoxP31 Tregs in transplant recipients on day 28 after BMT. As
predicted, the frequency and number (although the latter did not reach
significance) of CD41FoxP31 Tregs was reduced in proportion to the
donor T-cell dose in the BM graft and thus the severity of GVHD
(Figure 1C). Similarly, in the B6→B6D2F1 model (Figure 1D), the
severity of GVHD, as determined by clinical scores, was dependent on
the donor T-cell dose (Figure 1E), with only mild to moderate GVHD
induced with no associated mortality (data not shown), in response
to the low T-cell doses administered. Notably, compared with non-
GVHD controls, there was a profound decrease in CD41FoxP31 Treg
frequency and absolute numbers at all donor T-cell doses examined
(Figure 1F), suggesting that Treg homeostasis is exquisitely sensitive to
even subtle levels of aGVHD. Finally, the development of scleroderm-
atousGVHDwasconfirmedinbothmodels(Figure1G-H;supplemental
Figure 2A). Additionally, further histopathologic characterization of
GVHDtargetorgansintheB6→B6D2F1 modeldemonstrated collagen
deposition (fibrosis) in the lung, whereas inflammation and architectural
disorganization characterized pathology in the liver and salivary gland
(supplemental Figure 2B). Thus, cGVHD pathology in this model re-
capitulates the spectrum of cGVHD pathology that manifests clinically.
We previously demonstrated that aGVHD, early after BMT,
corrupts the capacity of donor conventional DC (cDC: CD11chiMHC
class II1) to present antigen within MHC class II.27 We therefore
investigated whether a defect in antigen presentation occurred in these
systems later after BMT, when cGVHD was developing. We used the
B6→B6D2F1 model whereby the donor graft consisted of BM derived
from CD11c.OVA transgenic (Tg) donors (ovalbumin [OVA] driven
off the CD11c promoter; predominantly expressed by cDCs) or wild-
type B6 (B6.WT) donors together with low doses of wild-type B6
T cells (0.5 3 106). At day 28 after BMT, carboxyfluorescein diacetate
succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled OT-II TCR Tg reporter T cells
(which specifically recognize the OVA(323-339)-derived peptide
presented in MHC class II) were adoptively transferred into recipients.
Three days later, CFSE dilution in adoptively transferred OT-II Tg
T-cells was assessed to quantify antigen presentation by donor cDC.
OT-II Tg T cells failed to proliferateinrecipients of B6.WT grafts(with
or without T cells), confirming the specificity of the OT-II response to
donor MHC/ova peptide complex and negating a contribution from
homeostatic proliferation in TCD recipients. In contrast, OT-II Tg

 T cells proliferated robustly in recipients of CD11c.OVA TCD BM
grafts, but this was markedly attenuated by the addition of T cells to the
graftand consequentGVHD(Figure1I).Ofnote,at the time of transfer,
the OT-II cells are healthy and are only exposed to a GVHD en-
vironment for a limited period of time; thus, these assays primarily
reflect Ag presentation. Indeed we previously demonstrated that the
proliferation of third party (DBA/1) T cells in these systems was not
impaired and thus the effect is not due to proliferation defects.27 As we
have recently reported, GVHD increases MHC class II expression on
donor cDCs,27,30 which we confirmed here at this late time point (data
not shown). Thus, altered MHC expression does not explain the
impaired cDC function in the setting of GVHD. We therefore next
sought to ascertain the predominant source of antigen (ie, donor
vs host) being presented by donor DC at D28 after transplant and
enumerate the number of donor DC presenting these antigens. We
used the YAe antibody that detects an MHC class II–derived
peptide (Ea peptide) loaded on MHC class II (I-Ab) and 2 models
of GVHD (B6→B6D2F1 and B6D2F1→FVB/N) in which the Ea
peptide could only be derived from the host (allo-antigen) or
donor (self-antigen) compartments, respectively. Thus, the sys-
tems are set up such that the peptide can originate from recipient
and be presented by donor (B6→B6D2F1) or originate from and
be presented by donor (B6D2F1→FVB). Notably, we confirmed
the development of sclerodermatous skin GVHD with associated
liver, lung, and salivary gland pathology (supplemental Figure 3)
in the B6D2F1→FVB/N model. As previously noted, the cDC
expression of MHC class II was upregulated (data not shown).
Furthermore, we demonstrate a significantly increased number of
YAe1 donor DC expressing self-antigen compared with allo-
antigen expressing donor DCs (.100 fold) and that GVHD
significantly reduced the number of both (Figure 1J). Impor-
tantly, not only was the absolute number of DC presenting donor
Ag reduced, but also their antigen presenting capacity as reflected
by a reduced proportion of YAe-positive DCs in the donor DC
compartment (supplemental Figure 5A). In the system measuring
recipient Ag presentation by donor DCs, there is a decrease in
absolute number of splenic donor DCs during GVHD (supple-
mental Figure 5B), but this was not significant in the GVHD
system determining presentation of donor Ags. This likely
reflects relative differences in levels of GVHD in the 2 systems.
Thus, the reduction in presentation of donor Ags during GVHD is
predominantly due to reduced levels of Ag rather than numbers of
donor DCs. Interestingly, the presentation of alloantigen in the
gastrointestinal tract was increased in animals with GVHD
(supplemental Figure 5D), consistent with recent observations
demonstrating the ability of donor colonic DC to expand effector
T cells at this site.24 It is also important to note that in the spleen
the proportion of donor DC presenting host alloantigen is very
small and this is in contrast to the same alloantigen presentation
by donor DCs in the mesenteric lymph nodes (supplemental
Figure 5C) as previously reported.24 The total number of donor
DCs in the mesenteric lymph nodes, however, is not affected by
the subclinical levels of GVHD late after BMT in these models
(supplemental Figure 5D). Thus, in these systems, the primary
impairment of Ag presentation in the periphery during GVHD
appears to be of donor rather than recipient antigen. We therefore
demonstrate significant impairment of allo- and especially self-
antigen presentation, demonstrated here with the YAe peptide,
which recapitulated the observed defective antigen presentation
of the Ova derived peptide (323-339; as determined by OTII
proliferation; Figure 1I) by donor DC in the periphery during
GVHD.
MHC II deficiency within donor cDCs induces Treg deficiency
and cGVHD
Having demonstrated a diminished MHC class II antigen presentation
and a significant reduction in CD41FoxP31 Tregs during cGVHD, we
next sought to causally link these 2 observations. Previous studies
demonstrated that BMT recipients of MHC class II–deficient BM
developed cGVHD pathology, which was prevented by thymectomy.9
These studies demonstrated that T cells escaping thymic negative
selection were self-reactive and able to mediate cGVHD in secondary
recipients. Although this establishes that BM derived T cells were
responsible for cGVHD, it does not ascertain whether the pathologic
T-cell response occurs in the thymus or at a later stage in the periphery
(because T cells will be affected both centrally and peripherally). We
hypothesize that the failure of donor MHC class II antigen presentation
by cDCs in the presence of aGVHD leads toreduced Tregdevelopment
late after transplant, leading to a loss of tolerance and the development
of cGVHD. We thus investigated whether the absence of MHC class II
within the BM graft leads to Treg deficiency and cGVHD. We de-
terminedtheseverityofcGVHDinB6D2F1recipientstransplantedwith
B6.WT or MHC class II–deficient (H2-Ab12/2) TCD BM grafts. The
recipients of H2-Ab1-/- TCD BM grafts indeed developed GVHD
as reflected by increasing clinical scores from day 50 after transplant
(Figure2A).Examinationofskinatday70aftertransplantconfirmedthe
development of cGVHD9,31and that MHC class II deficiency in the BM
graft induced clear sclerodermatous-like pathology in the skin of these
recipients (Figure 2B). Examination of splenic CD41FoxP31 Tregs at
day 70 revealed a significant reduction in CD41FoxP31Treg frequency
and absolute number in H2-Ab12/2 TCD BM recipients compared with
recipients of WT TCD BM (Figure 2C). These data support the notion
thatimpairedMHCclassIIantigenpresentationinducesafailureofTreg
homeostasis, potentially leading to the development of cGVHD.
We next examined whether these effects were specifically due
to defective MHC class II antigen presentation by donor cDCs by
using I-Ab-CD11c-Crepos donors to induce cDC-specific MHC class II
deficiency. The transplantation of BM from these recipients recapit-
ulated the clinical and histologic phenotypes seen in the setting of
global donor MHC class II deficiency (Figure 3A-B). Moreover, at day
93aftertransplant,wenotedasignificantreductioninthefrequencyand
absolute number of splenic CD41FoxP31 Tregs in BMT recipients
lacking MHC class II within donor cDCs compared with the WT non-
GVHD control group (CD11c-Creneg TCD BM) regardless of the
presence of preexisting GVHD (Figure 3C-D). Importantly, the
absence of MHC class II in donor cDCs combined with aGVHD
resulted in a synergistic reduction in splenic donor Treg numbers.
Although more marked in the spleen, donor DC MHC class II
deficiency also resulted in a modest reduction in thymic Tregs in TCD
recipients. However, when T cells were included in the grafts, the
proportion and absolute number of thymic Tregs was similar to that
of non-GVHD controls (Figure 3C-D). Thus, although the absence of
MHCclassIIondonorcDCswithinthethymusresultsinthegeneration
of autoreactive donor T cells, ultimately responsible for cGVHD, the
ability to control these aberrant T cells lies within the Treg pool, whose
maintenance is dependent on MHC class II presentation by donor
cDCs, predominantly in the periphery. To understand the mechanism
of Treg failure in the absence of MHC class II antigen presentation
specifically in cDCs, we tracked FoxP31 Treg development in recipients
transplanted with CD31 T cells from B6.FoxP3-luc1 donor mice in
which expression of the luciferase (luc) is driven off the FoxP3 promoter.
We imaged the mice weekly and observed in the WT (CD11c-Creneg)
recipients (with intact MHC class II antigen presentation), an increase
in FoxP3-luc1 cells at day 14, which peaked around day 40, and then

 gradually decreased and disappeared by day 65 (Figure 3E-F). As
expected, there was a failure in homeostasis within FoxP3-luc1 cells in
the absence of MHC class II in cDCs. This homeostatic failure in Tregs
was similar when all donor APCs lacked MHC class II, demonstrating
the critical role for donor cDCs in maintaining Tregs.
Because the previous experiments demonstrated a critical role for
donor cDCs in maintaining Tregs and preventing cGVHD, we next
sought to understand the consequence of defective antigen presentation
within MHC class II on effector T-cell (Teff) expansion and GVHD
in the absence of thymic-derived Tregs (tTreg). We tracked Teff
expansion by using CD31 T-cells from B6.luc1 donors that were
depleted of tTregs. We observed that the Teff in recipients of BM from
both CD11c-Creneg and pos donors expanded maximally in the third
week and also late after BMT (10 weeks) (Figure 4A-B). As previously
demonstrated, maximal donor CD4 effector T-cell expansion early after
BMT required MHC class II–restricted antigen presentation by donor
DCs,24 but expansion thereafter could be maintained independently of
donorDCMHCclassIIexpressioninanimalswith mild aGVHD.Taken
together, our data demonstrate that antigen presentation within MHC
class II by donor cDCs is critical to maintain and expand both mature
donor CD41FoxP31Tregs (contained within the graft) and BM-derived
Tregs, which together prevent the development of cGVHD. Impor-
tantly, the homeostatic role of MHC class II antigen presentation in
donor cDCs appears to occur predominantly in the periphery.
Donor Tregs prevent the generation of scleroderma
We next investigated whether there is a direct cause and effect
relationship between increased CD41FoxP31 Treg numbers and
protection from cGVHD. We used the B6→B6D2F1 model using
low T-cell doses (0.5 3 106) to induce mild GVHD, and BM grafts
from B6.FoxP3-DTR-GFP donor mice in which expression of the
diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) is driven off the FoxP3 promoter such
that specific FoxP31Treg depletion could be maintained by continued
administration of DT (Figure 5A). Because we observed that donor
CD41FoxP31 Tregs expand in the first week after BMT, we initiated
depletion from day 7 and confirmed Treg depletion at day 28
(Figure 5B-C).Asexpected inthe noDTgroups,the cellularityofboth
spleen and thymus were significantly reduced in the presence of low-
grade aGVHD and at this early time point (day 28) when the effects of
aGVHD are more prominent, the number of CD41FoxP31 Treg was
reduced in both of these organs (Figure 5D-E). Moreover, in recipients
administered DT, Tregs were significantly reduced in both the spleen
and thymus (Figure 5C-E), which was associated with late cGVHD
lethality, regardless of the presence of donor T cells in the initial graft
(median survival BM 1 T graft 1 DT: 37 days vs BM 1 T graft 1
saline: 70 days)(Figure5F).Accordingly, allrecipientsinwhich Tregs
were depleted developed scleroderma (Figure 5G). These data were

Adoptive transfer of natural Treg cells attenuates cGVHD
Recently,ahumanstudydemonstratedthatlow-doseinterleukin(IL)-2,
required for homeostatic maintenance of Tregs, increases Tregs after
BMT with consequent amelioration of cGVHD.32 Thus, therapeutic
transfer and/or expansion of tTregs would appear to be a promising
therapeutic approach for cGVHD. We therefore investigated whether
the cGVHD that develops when CD41FoxP31 Tregs are absent
could be prevented when naive donor CD41 Tregs were adoptively
transferred into these recipients. We depleted donor tTregs as pre-
viously described from day 7, and concurrently adoptively transferred
sort purified CD41 Treg from CD45.11 congenic donors at day 14
(Figure 6A-B). Importantly, these adoptively transferred tTregs are not
susceptible to depletion by DT as they do not express the DTR. The
adoptive transfer of CD41 Tregs resulted in significantly lower clinical
scores and improved survival compared with the control mice
(median survival DT: 40 days vs DT 1 Treg: 81 days, although most
animalssubsequentlysuccumbedtoGVHD;Figure6C).Importantly,the
adoptive transfer of CD41 Tregs reduced skin pathology. In this regard,
hematoxylinandeosin(H&E)andMasson’strichromestaining(collagen
fibers are stained blue) of skin harvested at D35 after transplant showed
retention of subcutaneous fat and hair follicles and reduced fibrosis
in BMT recipients receiving adoptively transferred CD41 Tregs
(Figure 6D). In conclusion, we showed that CD41 Treg transfer sig-
nificantly improved cutaneous cGVHD, confirming a critical role for
CD41 Tregs in the control of cGVHD.

 resulting from the increased use of G-CSF PB as the stem cell source.
Unfortunately, the pathophysiology of cGVHD is poorly understood,
and greater mechanistic insights are required to allow the strategic
development of specific treatment. Several studies have demonstrated
an association between cGVHDand reduced circulating Treg numbers,
implicating a role for this population in maintaining immune tolerance
following allogeneic BMT.17-19 However, the factors contributing to
reduced Treg numbers after transplant and a direct contribution of this
Treg deficit to cGVHD have yet to be fully elucidated. In this study, we
demonstrate that impaired MHC class II antigen presentation by cDCs
after transplant results in a failure of Treg homeostasis and that this
promotes the development of cGVHD, which could be ameliorated by
the adoptive transfer of nTreg.
The single most effective clinical predictor for the development of
cGVHD is the prior development of aGVHD, although cGVHD can
occur in the absence of prior aGVHD. However, there remains the
possibility that low-level alloreactive responses occur even in patients
who do not meet diagnostic criteria for low-grade GVHD and that this
subclinical aGVHD may contribute to the subsequent development
of cGVHD. Thus, clarification of how aGVHD functions to promote
cGVHD is required. In the current studies, we used a low dose of donor
TcellsintheBMgrafttoinducecGVHDpathologylateaftertransplant,
which is preceded by subtle aGVHD. In this setting, cGVHD was
associated with diminished MHC class II antigen presentation within
donor cDCs as we have previously reported in the setting of aGVHD.27
Our previous studies have explored the contribution of inflammatory
pathways in cDC impairment, and although the GVHD-associated
cytokine milieu was critical in the process, the only cytokine found
to specifically contribute was tumor necrosis factor, and this was
only partial. Factors such as glucocorticoids, IL-10, and trans-
forming growth factor b have been reported to promote the
differentiation of tolerogenic Treg-inducing DCs33,34; however,
whether a deficiency in these signaling pathways occurs in GVHD
or impacts on antigen presentation has yet to be explored. Im-
portantly, we now demonstrate for the first time that the majority of
donor DCs are presenting donor-derived antigen compared with
host-derived alloantigen and that a quantitative impairment of both
occurs during GVHD in the periphery.
Having demonstrated perturbed cDC MHC class II–restricted
antigen presenting function in the setting of GVHD, and as cDCs are
known to play a key role in the induction and maintenance of Tregs,21
we studied whether Treg deficiency after transplant is a direct con-
sequence of defective cDC function. In support of a role for defective
MHC class II antigen presentation in cGVHD pathology, a previous
study reported that donor MHC class II deficiency leads to cGVHD
due to a lack of MHC class II expression on thymic cDCs, resulting
in impaired thymic selection and the development and release of
pathogenic autoreactive T cells.9 Notably, in this study and ours, the
number of Treg in the thymus was not, or only minimally affected. In
contrast, in the absence of donor MHC class II, we found a striking
reduction in Treg number in the periphery. Moreover, we demonstrate
that MHC class II expression by donor cDCs specifically is required for
Treg maintenance, the absence of which results in the development of
cGVHD.Insupportofthis,arecentstudydemonstratedthatdonorTreg
maintenance after stem cell transplantation is promoted via donor, but

From 
 Indeed, our data showed a marked, albeit incomplete, improvement
in clinical scores, survival, and cGVHD pathology following the
adoptive transfer of nTregs. However, the failure to completely
alleviate cGHVD highlights the need to develop improved Treg-
based cell therapy strategies to treat cGVHD. In this regard, the
significant factors limiting the application of this therapy include the
scarcity of Tregs in human blood, inherent FoxP3, and functional
instability of Tregs15,41 and their poor survival after transfer.
Therefore, studies to date have based their effort on focusing on
approaches to modulate nTreg expansion and/or stabilization. The
therapeutic ratio of Tregs to conventional CD4 T cells can be as high
as 10:1; thus, collection of sufficient numbers of unmanipulated
donor Tregs from blood for adequate treatment doses is difficult.
Strategies to overcome this barrier include ex vivo tTreg expansion
and the in vitro generation of induced Tregs from conventional CD4
T cells, both of which can yield realistic therapeutic doses.42,43
Additionally, alternate immunosuppressive strategies to improve
Treg survival after transplant are under investigation.44,45 IL-2 is a
cytokine known to improve survival, proliferation, and function of
T lymphocytes and also Tregs, as they express the high affinity IL-2
receptor (CD25). Encouragingly, in recent clinical studies, treat-
ment of cGVHD patients with low-dose IL-2 elicited a reduction
in cGVHD signs and symptoms in one half of the patients
studied.32,46,47 The individual use or combination of the mechanistic
target of rapamycin pathway inhibitor rapamycin with IL-2/anti–IL-2
antibody complexes has also improved Treg stability.15,48,49 However,
further clinical studies are required to improve the expansion of nTregs
after their transfer into patients.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that cGVHD is induced by a failure
in CD41FoxP31 Tregs in the periphery, and not in the thymus, as a
consequence of impaired MHC class II antigen presentation by donor
cDCs after transplant induced by even subtle levels of aGVHD. Im-
portantly, this study highlights the therapeutic potential for the adoptive
transfer of CD41FoxP31 Tregs and/or the therapeutic expansion of
CD41FoxP31 Tregs in vivo to treat cGVHD in the clinic.
