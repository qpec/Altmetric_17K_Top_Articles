 Association of Persistent and Severe Postnatal Depression
With Child Outcomes

IMPORTANCE Maternal postnatal depression (PND) is common and associated with adverse
child outcomes. These effects are not inevitable, and it is critical to identify those most at risk.
Previous work suggests that the risks of adverse outcomes are increased when PND is severe
and persistent, but this has not been systematically studied.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association between differing levels of persistence and severity of
PND and long-term child outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The sample for this observational study comprised
participants in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children in the United Kingdom.
Three thresholds of PND severity—moderate, marked, and severe—were defined using the
self-rated Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Depression was defined as
persistent when the EPDS score was above the threshold level at both 2 and 8 months after
childbirth. For each of these severity and persistence categories, the following were
examined: (1) the trajectories of later EPDS scores (6 time points between 21 months and
11 years after childbirth) and (2) child outcomes—behavioral problems at 3.5 years of age,
school-leaving mathematics grades at 16 years of age, and depression at 18 years of age. Data
analysis was conducted from July 12, 2016, to February 8, 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Child behavioral problems at 3.5 years of age using the
Rutter total problems scale, school-leaving mathematics grades at 16 years of age extracted
from records of external national public examinations, and offspring depression at 18 years of
age using the Clinical Interview Schedule–Revised.
RESULTS For the 9848 mothers in the sample, the mean (SD) age at delivery was 28.5 (4.7)
years. Of the 8287 children, 4227 (51%) were boys and 4060 (49%) were girls. Compared
with women with PND that was not persistent and women who did not score above the EPDS
threshold, for all 3 severity levels, women with persistent PND showed elevated depressive
symptoms up to 11 years after childbirth. Whether persistent or not, PND doubled the risk of
child behavior disturbance. The odds ratio (OR) for child behavioral disturbance for mothers
with moderate PND was 2.22 (95% CI, 1.74-2.83), for mothers with marked PND was 1.91
(95% CI, 1.36-2.68), and for mothers with severe PND was 2.39 (95% CI, 1.78-3.22).
Persistence of severe PND was particularly important to child development, substantially
increasing the risk for behavioral problems at 3.5 years of age (OR, 4.84; 95% CI, 2.94-7.98),
lower mathematics grades at 16 years of age (OR, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.26-5.57), and higher
prevalence of depression at 18 years of age (OR, 7.44; 95% CI, 2.89-19.11).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Persistent and severe PND substantially raises the risk for
adverse outcome on all child measures. Meeting criteria for depression both early and late in
the postnatal year, especially when the mood disturbance is severe, should alert health care
professionals to a depression that is likely to be persistent and to be associated with an
especially elevated risk of multiple adverse child outcomes. Treatment for this group should
be prioritized.

 P
ostnatal depression (PND), also known as postpartum
depression, is common, affecting approximately 10%
of women in high-income countries,1 with higher esti-
mates in low- and middle-income countries.2 Extensive re-
search documents the association of PND with child develop-
ment, including delayed cognitive and language development,
higher rates of behavioral problems, insecure or disorganized
attachment, lower school-leaving grades (ie, General Certifi-
cateofSecondaryEducation[GCSE]examinationsintheUnited
Kingdom) at 16 years, and higher rates of depression at 16 to
18 years of age.3-6 An economic analysis suggests that, in the
United Kingdom alone, the long-term costs of perinatal ma-
ternal mental health disorders may reach up to £8.1 billion (US
$10.8billionasofDecember2017)peryearforevery1-yearbirth
cohort, principally because of the impact on the children.7
Twofactorssuggestedtobeimportantindeterminingchild
outcomes in the context of maternal depression are the chro-
nicity and severity of the maternal mood disorder, but data are
limited for PND specifically.8-14 Campbell and colleagues15
found an increased risk for the child if PND persisted to 6
months after childbirth, when infants of mothers with persis-
tent depression were less positive during interactions than in-
fants of women with either no depression or remitted depres-
sion.Similarly,PettersonandAlbers8reportedthat,inasample
of children younger than 5 years, compared with nonexposed
children, those exposed to persistent maternal depression had
lower cognitive scores (a decrement of 0.47 SDs for girls and
0.36 for boys). Beyond the perinatal period, the Sequenced
Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) Child
studies, which examined depression in mothers of school-
aged children, have shown that the risk of offspring depres-
sion increased markedly with both the chronicity and sever-
ity of maternal depression.16 In summary, evidence suggests
that both persistent PND and severe PND raise the risk of ad-
verse child outcomes.3,8-10
However, PND that is both severe and persistent has not
been well described in the literature, as highlighted by a re-
cent report for the US Preventive Services Task Force.17 Stud-
ies have generally included small sample sizes, had short-
term follow-up periods, and examined a limited range of
outcomes. Systematic research into this question is therefore
requiredtoestablishtheprecisedurationandsymptomthresh-
olds of significance for compromised child functioning. Elu-
cidating the relative magnitude of the consequences for chil-
dren of different levels of PND severity and persistence could
helpwithtargetinginterventionresources,therebylimitingthe
time children are exposed to maternal depression and poten-
tially compromised parenting.
Using participants in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Par-
ents and Children (ALSPAC), we investigated the sequelae of
PND on subsequent maternal depression and child outcome.
The ALSPAC involves multiple assessments of maternal de-
pressionoverthefirst18yearsofoffspringlife,including2post-
natal assessments. Our study had 2 aims: (1) to examine the
natural course of different levels of PND severity identified at
2 and 8 months after childbirth using growth curve modeling
and (2) to examine the association of PND persistence and se-
verity with child behavioral problems at 3.5 years of age, GCSE
mathematics grades at 16 years of age, and self-reported de-
pression at 18 years of age. These 3 offspring outcomes have
been shown to be associated with maternal PND in this
sample.18-20 We hypothesized that (1) women with persistent
and severe PND would continue to show elevated levels of
depression at the following assessments and (2) children
of women with persistent and severe PND would be at an in-
creased risk for behavioral problems, lower mathematics
grades, and higher rates of depression.
Methods
Sample
Our study sample comprised participants in the ALSPAC co-
hort (see the eAppendix in the Supplement for full details).21
Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the ALSPAC
Law and Ethics Committee and the local research ethics com-
mittees. All participants provided written informed consent.
Data analysis was conducted from July 12, 2016, to February
8, 2017.
We had complete data on maternal depression in the post-
natal year for 9848 mothers and at 11 years after childbirth for
6182 mothers. Data were available on child behavioral prob-
lems at 3.5 years of age for 8419 children, on GCSE mathemat-
ics grades at 16 years of age for 5198 children, and on off-
spring depression at 18 years of age for 3613 children.
Depression Measures
Maternal depression was measured using the self-rated Edin-
burgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS; score range: 0-30,
with higher scores indicating more severe depressive
symptoms).19,22 We defined 3 levels of PND severity: 13 to 14
points indicating moderate depression; 15 to 16 points, marked
depression; and 17 or more points, severe depression. These
threshold levels are consistent with those in previous
analyses23 and have been shown to have high specificity and
positive predictive value for major depressive disorder (for ≥13
Key Points
Question What is the association of differing levels of persistence
and severity of postnatal depression with long-term child
outcomes?
Findings This observational study of 9848 women with varying
levels of postnatal depression and 8287 children found that,
compared with children of women with postnatal depression that
did not persist, of either moderate or severe intensity, children of
women with persistent and severe depression are at an increased
risk for behavioral problems by age 3.5 years as well as lower
mathematics grades and depression during adolescence.
Furthermore, women with persistent postnatal depression are
likely to experience significant depressive symptoms until at least
11 years after childbirth.
Meaning Women with persistent and severe postnatal depression
should be prioritized for treatment because they are likely to continue
to experience high levels of depressive symptoms and because of
the high risk of adverse child development.

 points: 95.7% and 66.7%; for ≥15: 99.3% and 82.7%; and for
≥17 points: 99.7% and 92.4%, respectively).24 The thresholds
identified 3 groups of approximately equal size at both 2 and
8 months (ie, at 8 months, 8.7% of the population scored ≥13
points; of those, 3.3% scored 13-14 points, 2.2% scored 15-16
points, and 3.2% scored ≥17 points). Depression was assessed
at 2, 8, 21, 33, 61, 73, 93, and 134 months after childbirth to es-
tablish the natural course of PND.
Postnatal depression was identified as persistent when an
individual scored above the EPDS threshold at both the 2- and
8-month postnatal assessment. Postnatal depression was con-
sidered not persistent when someone scored above the thresh-
old only at the 2-month postnatal assessment. In this way, we

(2) moderate but not persistent depression (EPDS score of 13-14

months; EPDS score of ≥13 points at 8 months), (6) marked and
persistent depression (EPDS score of 15-16 points at 2 months;
EPDS score of ≥15 points at 8 months), and (7) severe and per-
sistent depression (EPDS score of ≥17 points at 2 and 8 months).
Maternal Measures
Mothers participating in the ALSPAC indicated their highest
education level on a questionnaire, which was sent out in their
last trimester of pregnancy (eAppendix in the Supplement).
Motherswitheducationcontinuingbeyond16yearsofagewere
categorized as having high education (3841 [39%] of the
sample), and those with education up to 16 years of age were
categorized as having low education (6007 [61%]).
Child Measures
Rutter Total Problems Scale
Child behavioral problems at 3.5 years of age were assessed by
maternal report using the total problems scale (sum of hyper-
activity and emotional and conduct problems) of the Rutter
revised preschool questionnaire.25 The measure was split into
quartiles.
School-Leaving Mathematics Grades
Grades achieved in mathematics were extracted from rec-
ords of the GCSE, which are external national public exami-
nations taken at 16 years of age at the end of high school in the
United Kingdom. The accepted binary coding was the achieve-
ment of an A* to a C grade (coded as 0) or no such achieve-
ment (coded as 1).
Offspring Depression
Offspring depression was assessed at 18 years of age using the
ClinicalInterviewSchedule–Revised,aself-administeredcom-
puterized interview.26 A binary variable indicating a diagno-
sis of depression on the Clinical Interview Schedule–Revised
or no such diagnosis was the outcome measure (eAppendix in
the Supplement).
Confounding Variables
Owing to the relatively small sample size of mothers with PND
that was persistent and marked (n = 75) or severe (n = 83), it
was important to maintain the sample size and minimize the
complexity of statistical models. Therefore, in the adjusted
models, we controlled only for maternal education, the only
variable in this sample shown to considerably influence the as-
sociation between PND and child outcomes.3,19
Statistical Analysis
We explored the EPDS trajectories of women across 6 re-
peated assessments from 21 months to 11 years after child-
birth using linear growth modeling and controlling for mater-
nal education (Stata command: xtmixed, using mixed-effects
maximum likelihood regression and unstructured covari-
ance matrix; Stata, version 13 [StataCorp LLC]). We compared
both the intercepts (overall mean EPDS scores across the re-
peatedmeasures)andtheslopes(theextenttowhichthescores
increased or decreased over time, achieved by exploring the
interaction between the PND and time variables). We present
EPDS means and SDs at 21 months, 33 months, and 11 years.
We performed logistic and ordered logistic regressions,
controlling for maternal education, to investigate the associa-
tion between PND and the 3 child outcomes18-20 (child behav-
ioral problems at 3.5 years of age, GCSE mathematics grades
at 16 years of age, and offspring depression at 18 years of age).
Weexamineddifferentlevelsofseverityandpersistencetoelu-
cidate the contribution of these factors and to explore a po-
tential dose-response relationship.
Results
For the 9848 mothers in the sample, the mean (SD) age at de-
livery was 28.5 (4.7) years. Of the 8287 children, 4227 (51%)
were boys and 4060 (49%) were girls.
Long-term Course of Depression
Table 1 presents means and SDs of EPDS scores for the 3 levels
of PND severity (moderate, marked, and severe) at 21 months,
33 months, and 11 years for mothers with PND that did or did
not persist to 8 months.
Mean scores remained relatively stable from 21 months to
11 years for women with persistent PND. The mean EPDS score
ofwomenwithpersistentmoderatePNDremainedhighatsub-
sequenttimes:12.52(5.00)pointsat21monthsand12.45(5.64)

with persistent severe PND remained high with little improve-
ment even up to 11 years after childbirth: 16.29 (4.98) points
at 21 months and 14.49 (6.13) points at 11 years.

 childbirth) and the influence of PND severity and persistence
on these trajectories. For the sample as a whole, the models
indicate that, after the postnatal year, there was little change
in the mean EPDS scores over time; mean EPDS scores rose by
0.004 points (95% CI, −0.02 to 0.03) at each repeated assess-
ment. Compared with women who were not above the thresh-
old in the postnatal year (EPDS score <13 points), all other
groups had consistently higher EPDS scores up to 11 years af-
ter childbirth that progressed in a stepwise function. Com-
pared with women in the reference group, women with an
EPDS score of 13 to 14 points at 2 months only (moderate but
notpersistentPND)hadhigherEPDSscoresof,onaverage,3.46
points (95% CI, 2.86-4.05); women whose EPDS scores were
17 or more points at 2 months only (severe but not persistent
PND) had higher EPDS scores of, on average, 5.84 points (95%
CI, 5.13-6.55); women whose EPDS scores were 13 to 14 points
at both 2 and 8 months (moderate and persistent PND) had
higher EPDS scores of, on average, 6.91 points (95% CI, 5.98-
7.83); and women whose EPDS scores were 17 or more points
at both 2 and 8 months (severe and persistent PND) had higher
EPDS scores of, on average, 9.90 points (95% CI, 8.73-11.08).
There was no evidence that the change in scores (the slope)
differed between women with depression that did not persist
and women with depression that did persist, suggesting that
EPDS scores did not improve over time and were consistently
higher compared with women with no depression (Table 2).
Child Outcomes
Table 3 presents the odds ratios (ORs) of adverse child out-
comesusingthe3thresholdsofPNDseverityforwomenwhose
PND did or did not persist.
Nonpersistent PND
For mothers with PND that was not persistent (ie, depression
only at 2 months after childbirth), the risk of child behavioral
disturbance at 3.5 years of age was somewhat raised; this risk
was similar whatever PND severity threshold was applied.
Thus, the OR for child behavioral disturbance for the mater-
nal group with moderate PND was 2.22 (95% CI, 1.74-2.83), for
the group with marked PND was 1.91 (95% CI, 1.36-2.68), and
for the group with severe PND was 2.39 (95% CI, 1.78-3.22).
For the outcomes of GCSE mathematics grades at 16 years
of age and offspring depression at 18 years of age, PND that was
not persistent was not associated with increased risk. Further-
more, risk did not differ substantially between levels of sever-
ity with the exception of the group of mothers with marked
PND, with offspring showing higher rates of depression at 18
years of age (OR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.03-5.29).
Persistent PND
ChildrenofwomenwithpersistentPNDofmoderate(OR,3.04;
95% CI, 2.10-4.38) or marked severity (OR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.71-
4.71) were at higher risk of behavioral problems at 3.5 years of
age compared with children of women with PND that was not
persistent at any level of severity. The ORs for lower math-
ematics grades at 16 years of age and depression at 18 years of
age were not substantially elevated in the context of either
moderate or marked PND.

 Compared with children of women with an EPDS score of
less than 13 points in the postnatal year (reference group), chil-
dren of women with persistent and severe depression were at
the highest risk for all 3 adverse child outcomes (behavioral
problems OR, 4.84 [95% CI, 2.94-7.98]; lower GCSE mathemat-
ics grades OR, 2.65 [95% CI, 1.26-5.57]; higher depression rate
OR, 7.44 [95% CI, 2.89-19.11]).
Discussion
We used a longitudinal prospective sample from a study with
multiple assessments (ALSPAC) to examine the long-term
course of PND and the association of PND at varying levels of
severity and chronicity with child development. The adverse
consequences on child development of severe and persistent
PND is of particular note given the long-term follow-up of the
children.
Using linear growth modeling, the data indicate that de-
pression scores from 21 months to 11 years show relative sta-
bility. The data also indicate a step function, with higher mean
depression scores for women whose PND persisted from 2 to
8 months after childbirth compared with women who scored
below the threshold and those whose PND was not persis-
tent. Further analysis indicated that, although the intercepts
were higher for those with persistent PND, the slopes did not
differ, suggesting that women with PND did not improve over
time and women with persistent PND consistently remained
at relatively higher EPDS scores. We found elevated risks for
adverse outcomes for children of women who had persistent
PND compared with women whose PND did not persist, and
this association was especially pronounced in the group with
persistent and severe PND. Postnatal depression that was not
persistent either at moderate or marked severity level did not

 In practice, perinatal depression data are routinely col-
lected in the United Kingdom, as recommended by the Na-
tional Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines.27
Our results show that women who meet criteria for PND both
early and late in the postpartum year are at an increased risk
forprolongeddepression.Inaddition,PNDismostlikelytoraise
the risk for adverse child development when PND is severe and
persistent. Health care professionals should identify these
women for further referral because early and effective treat-
ment could reduce the continued exposure of the child. Owing
tothefrequentcontactwithhealthcareprofessionalsintheperi-
natalperiod,itispossibletoidentifywomenwithpersistentPND
during this period. Identification of women with PND may be
associated with increased treatment costs, but the overall cost
tothepublicsectorofperinatalmentalhealthproblemsis5times
more than the cost of improving services,7 further highlight-
ing that early intervention and effective treatment of perinatal
depression are a public health priority.
To date, the literature is mixed on whether treating mater-
naldepressionleadstopositivechildoutcomes,particularlyfor
depression in the early years of life. Treatments for PND have
beenrelativelybriefindurationandmoderateinintensity;there-
fore,itisperhapsunsurprisingthatsuchinterventionshavenot

A limited number of interventions targeting the mother-child
relationship have shown some short-term benefits for out-
comes,suchasattachmentandbehavior.32-34Thisfindinghigh-
lightsthecomplexissueoftreatmentrecommendations,which
may be further compounded by persistent and severe PND,
which may in itself require more intensive treatment.
Strengths and Limitations
A particular strength of our analysis is the large sample, which
allowed us to categorize depressive symptoms in a stepwise
function. However, the higher thresholds of marked and se-
vere PND do not invariably reflect clinically severe depres-
sion, and thus further research using diagnostic instruments
is needed. Other strengths of this study include the long-
term follow-up and the inclusion of different outcomes at dif-
ferent ages, all of which confirm the increased risk for chil-
dren of women with persistent and severe PND symptoms.
Our study was also subject to some limitations, includ-
ing a relatively small number of women meeting criteria for
persistent and severe PND. The ALSPAC has high attrition,
especially during the later time points. The patterns of miss-
ing data suggest that children most disadvantaged and more
likely to have mothers with depression are overrepresented
in the group with missing data20; however, previous imputa-
tion analysis of the association between PND and mathemat-
ics grades and depression revealed that these associations
did not attenuate following imputation.19,20 Women experi-
encing significant levels of depression may be more likely to
opt out of the study. Therefore, our report on the proportion
of women who experience severe and persistent PND may
be an underestimate. Owing to the small sample size of
women with persistent and severe PND, we decided a priori
to control for maternal education only, as this is the demo-
graphic variable that has consistently been shown to influ-
ence the association between PND and child outcomes. Pre-
vious analyses showed no attenuation of the association
between PND and child outcomes by including other poten-
tial confounders.18-20
The ALSPAC study did not collect information on whether
women received psychological treatment, but the availabil-
ityofsuchtreatmentatthetimewasseverelylimited.Theavail-
able information indicates that less than 1% of the sample used
antidepressants, which is too small a subsample for a sub-
group analysis. Finally, women experiencing severe depres-
sive symptoms may be more likely to report child behavioral
problems.35 This observation is a potential limitation for 1 of
our outcomes; however, we present objective and self-
reported outcomes at 16 and 18 years of age indicating a simi-
lar pattern of risk when PND is persistent and severe.
Conclusions
The analyses we conducted highlight that women with per-
sistent depression in the postnatal year continue to experi-
ence elevated levels of depressive symptoms until at least 11
years after childbirth. Children of women with persistent PND,
especially when it is severe, are at an increased risk for a num-
ber of adverse outcomes. Screening both early and late in the
first postpartum year will enable the identification of women
with persistent PND and thus the offer of appropriate
treatment.36
