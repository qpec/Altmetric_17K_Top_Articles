IMPORTANCE Among Ashkenazi Jewish women, 3 mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 severely
increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancer. However, among Ashkenazi Jewish patients
with breast cancer who do not carry one of these founder mutations, the likelihood of
carrying another pathogenic mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 or another breast cancer gene is not
known. This information would be valuable to the patient and family for cancer prevention
and treatment.
OBJECTIVE To determine the frequency of cancer-predisposing mutations other than the
BRCA1 and BRCA2 founder alleles among patients of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry with
breast cancer.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this cohort study, genomic DNA of women from
12 major cancer centers with a first diagnosis of invasive breast cancer who identified
themselves and all 4 grandparents as Ashkenazi Jewish and participated in the New York
Breast Cancer Study (NYBCS) from 1996 to 2000 was sequenced for known and candidate
breast cancer genes. Data analysis was performed from July 10, 2014, to March 10, 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Genomic DNA from all 1007 NYBCS probands was
sequenced for 23 known and candidate breast cancer genes using BROCA, a targeted
multiplexed gene panel.
RESULTS Of the 1007 probands in the study, 903 probands had no founder mutations in
BRCA1 or BRCA2; of these probands, 7 (0.8%) carried another pathogenic mutation in BRCA1
or BRCA2, and 31 (3.4%) carried a pathogenic mutation in another breast cancer gene (29 in
CHEK2, and 1 each in BRIP1 and NBN). Of all inherited predispositions to breast cancer in the
NYBCS, 73.8% (104 of 142) were due to a BRCA1 or BRCA2 founder allele, 4.9% (7 of 142) to
another BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, and 21.8% (31 of 142) to a mutation in another gene.
Overall, 14.1% (142 of 1007) of Ashkenazi Jewish patients with breast cancer in the NYBCS
carried a germline mutation responsible for their disease: 11.0% (111 of 1007) in BRCA1 or
BRCA2, and 3.1% (31 of 1007) in CHEK2 or another breast cancer gene. Of the 111 patients with
BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, 57 (51.4%) had a mother or sister with breast or ovarian cancer
and 54 patients (48.6%) did not.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Comprehensive sequencing would provide complete relevant
genetic information for Ashkenazi Jewish patients with breast cancer.

them. Knowing whether a patient with breast or ovarian can-
cer carries a cancer-predisposing mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2
is valuable for both the patient and her family. The patient may
be well served by targeted treatment,1,2 and as-yet unaf-
fected sisters and daughters who learn that they also carry the
mutation can undertake risk-reducing preventive strategies.3,4
Thousands of different cancer-predisposing mutations in
BRCA1 and BRCA2 have been identified, and every popula-
tion that has been evaluated harbors such mutations, nearly
all individually extremely rare. In the Ashkenazi Jewish popu-
lation, the mutation profile of BRCA1 and BRCA2 is distinc-
tive, with the following 3 ancient founder mutations in these
2 genes: BRCA1 185delAG, BRCA1 5382insC, and BRCA2
6174delT. Notation for these variants based on Human
Genome Variation Society conventions5 are NM_007294.3
(BRCA1):c.68_69delAG (p.Glu23Valfs), NM_007294.3(BRCA1):
c.5266dupC (p.Gln1756Profs), and NM_000059.3(BRCA2):
c.5946delT (p.Ser1982Argfs). We will use the original names
forthevariantsbecausetheyaremorewidelyrecognized.Com-
bined, these 3 mutations are responsible for 10% of invasive
breast cancer among Ashkenazi Jewish women.6,7
The relatively high frequency of the Ashkenazi Jewish
founder mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 has enabled the ef-
fective use of cancer genetics services by Jewish women. How-
ever, for Ashkenazi Jewish patients with breast cancer who do
not carry one of these 3 founder alleles, the chance of carry-
ing some other pathogenic mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2, or a
pathogenic mutation in a different breast cancer gene, is not
known. Should Ashkenazi Jewish women with breast or ovar-
ian cancer who have negative results (ie, have wild-type se-
quences) for the 3 founder alleles obtain complete sequenc-
ingofBRCA1andBRCA2soasnottomisssomeothermutation?
Should these Ashkenazi Jewish patients also be tested for mu-
tations in other breast cancer genes?
We addressed these questions by sequencing all known
breast and ovarian cancer genes in genomic DNA provided by
participants of the New York Breast Cancer Study (NYBCS), a
longstanding cohort of Ashkenazi Jewish women with a pri-
mary diagnosis of invasive breast cancer.5 Participants in the
NYBCS were not selected for family history or age at diagno-
sis.TheirgenomicDNAhadbeenevaluatedforthefoundermu-
tations of BRCA1 and BRCA2, revealing one of these muta-
tions in 104 of the 1007 probands. For the present project, we
sequenced genomic DNA from these 1007 patients for all
known breast cancer genes using our BROCA gene panel, then
determined the frequency of cancer-predisposing mutations
in BRCA1, BRCA2, and other breast cancer genes among pa-
tients with none of the founder mutations and with various
family histories and ages at diagnosis.
Methods
Participants in the NYBCS were identified from 12 major can-
cer centers in the New York metropolitan area between 1996
and 2000, as previously described.5 Participants were
women experiencing their first diagnosis of invasive breast
cancer who identified themselves and all 4 grandparents as
Ashkenazi Jewish. Eligible women were invited to partici-
pate regardless of age at diagnosis, family history, or prior
genetic testing, which was still infrequent when these
patients were enrolled. Patients provided pedigree informa-
tion, permission to review records of pathologic findings for
their breast cancer, and a blood sample for extraction of
DNA. Of the 1007 index cases in the NYBCS, 987 (98.7%)
requested information about their original genetic results
and were provided this information by us in consultation
with their hospital’
s genetic counselors. Participants also
gave consent for their DNA to be used for future studies of
breast cancer genetics, as better sequencing technology
became available. Some participants requested that their
identifying information remain with their sample so that
they or their family could be informed of results of future
genetic testing; others agreed to the use of their DNA with
basic risk factor information retained, but with their identi-
fying information removed. The NYBCS was approved by the
institutional review boards of the participating hospitals and
by the University of Washington. Patients provided written
informed consent.
For the present project, DNA extracted from blood was
sequenced using BROCA, a targeted capture and massively
parallel sequencing test developed at the University of
Washington.8 For this project, we created a version of BROCA
specifically targeting 23 established and candidate breast can-
cer genes: BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM (GenBank NM_000051), ATR
(GenBank NM_001184), BAP1 (GenBank NM_004656), BARD1

Key Points
Question Among patients of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry with
breast cancer who do not carry one of the founder mutations
in BRCA1 or BRCA2, what is the likelihood of carrying another
cancer-predisposing mutation in BRCA1, BRCA2, or another breast
cancer gene?
Findings In this cohort study, 1007 patients of Ashkenazi Jewish
ancestry with breast cancer were evaluated by multiplex genomic
sequencing for all known and candidate breast cancer genes.
Among patients without a founder mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2,
0.8% carried a different mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 and 3.4%
carried a mutation in another gene.
Meaning Ashkenazi Jewish patients with breast cancer can
benefit from genetic testing for all breast cancer genes.

 XRCC2 (GenBank NM_005431). Sequencing results were
aligned to human reference genome hg19. Variants were iden-
tified after realignment of insertion-deletion variants (in-
dels) and base quality recalibration. Single nucleotide vari-
ants, small indels, and copy number variants were identified
as previously described.9 The consequences of mutations near
splice junctions were tested in RNA isolated from patients’
blood. Missense mutations were included only if they were
proven experimentally to be damaging, either as part of this
project or previously. Data analysis was performed from July
10, 2014, to March 10, 2017. Allele frequencies were com-
pared by 2-tailed χ2 tests, Mantel-Haenszel tests for linear
trend, or Fisher exact tests, as appropriate.
Results
The clinical characteristics for the NYBCS cohort are pro-
vided in Table 1. As previously reported,6 patients carrying one
of the founder mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 were younger at
diagnosis (mean [SD] age, 46.7 [10.7] years, vs 53.8 [11.1] years)
and more likely to have a family history of breast or ovarian
cancer (76 of 104 [73.1%]) than were patients with no founder
mutation (519 of 903 [57.5%]).

 mutation in another breast cancer gene (Table 2). Of the 7 mu-
tations in BRCA1 or BRCA2, 1 (BRCA2 c.8635del5) has not been
previously reported, and therefore may be private, and the
other 6 have been reported as rare alleles in non-Jewish
populations.10-12 Family history was suggestive for only 4 of
the 7 BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers. The frequencies of
these other BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations were higher among
patients diagnosed before 40 years of age (2 of 68 [2.9%])
compared with those diagnosed at 40 to 49 years of age (3 of
285 [1.1%]), 50 to 59 years of age (1 of 283 [0.4%]), or 60 years
of age or older (1 of 267 [0.4%]) (P = .03, determined by use
of the Mantel-Haenszel test).
Of the 32 patients with a damaging mutation in another
breast cancer gene, 29 were in CHEK2, and there was 1 each
in BRIP1 and NBN (Table 2). Of the 29 CHEK2 mutations, 24
were CHEK2 p.S428F, previously identified as an Ashkenazi
Jewish founder allele that increases breast cancer risk 2- to
3-fold13; 4 were CHEK2 c.1100delC, and 1 was CHEK2 c.444
(+1)G>A, both of which appear widely in Europe. Combined
frequencies of mutations in these genes were somewhat, al-
though not significantly, higher among patients diagnosed be-
fore 60 years of age (25 of 636 [3.9%]) than at 60 years of age
or older (6 of 267 [2.2%]; P = .20), and among patients with a
first-degree relative with breast cancer (14 of 295 [4.8%]) com-
pared with those with no such family history (17 of 608 [2.8%];
P = .10) (eTable in the Supplement).
OnepatientwhocarriedBRCA1185delAGand1patientwho
carried BRCA2 6174delT also carried CHEK2 p.S428F. The ages
at diagnosis of these 2 patients were 34 and 36 years, respec-
tively, among the youngest carrying one of the founder alleles.
No clearly pathogenic mutations were found in any other se-
quenced gene, and no damaging copy number variants were
found in any gene.
Integrating information from all genetic testing in the co-
hort reveals the distribution of mutations among genes
(Figure 1) and the association among genotype, age at diag-
nosis, and family history (Figure 2). As expected, there is a
strong association between age at breast cancer diagnosis and
the likelihood of carrying a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2,
whether a founder mutation or another damaging allele. How-
ever, age at diagnosis is not associated with the likelihood of
carrying a damaging mutation in the other genes. The mean
(SD) ages at diagnosis were 44.2 (9.9) years for patients with a
BRCA1 mutation; 46.4 (12.4) years for patients with a BRCA2
mutation; 52.6 (7.7) years for patients with a mutation in
CHEK2, BRIP1, or NBN; and 53.9 (11.2) years for patients with
no damaging mutation in any sequenced gene. Also, as ex-
pected, patients with a mother or sister with breast or ovar-
ian cancer were more likely than those without such a family
historytocarryadamagingmutationinBRCA1orBRCA2.How-
ever, approximately half of the patients with a damaging mu-
tation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 had no close family history of breast
or ovarian cancer; of the 111 patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mu-
tations, 57 (51.4%) had a mother or sister with breast or ovar-
ian cancer and 54 (48.6%) did not. Also, of 31 patients with a
damaging mutation in CHEK2, BRIP1, or NBN, 14 (45.2%) had
a mother or sister with breast or ovarian cancer and 17 (54.8%)
did not.
Figure 3 illustrates extended family R. Participant IV-7 was
diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer at 48 years of age, with
a recurrence at 59 years. She had negative test results for the
BRCA1 and BRCA2 founder mutations, including BRCA2
6174delT, which had been identified in her cousin (IV-1). Se-
quencing the genomic DNA of participant IV-7 for all known
breast cancer genes revealed that she is compound heterozy-

proved to carry 1 or both CHEK2 mutations. Homozygosity or
compound heterozygosity for damaging alleles of CHEK2 is as-
sociated with breast cancer risk similar to that seen with BRCA1
or BRCA2.14 All daughters of the compound heterozygous sis-

 Discussion
Many Ashkenazi Jewish patients with breast cancer have been
tested for the founder mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2. If a pa-
tient is negative (ie, has a normal sequence) for these muta-
tions, should she and her physician consider additional test-
ing? Our results offer perspectives on this question. First, for
an Ashkenazi Jewish patient with breast cancer who does not
carry a founder mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2, the chance of
carrying a different, equally damaging mutation in BRCA1
or BRCA2 is about 1%. If she was diagnosed before 40 years
of age, this chance increases to about 3%. Patients with such
mutations should be counseled for preventive salpingo-
oophorectomy and may be considered for poly–(adenosine
diphosphate–ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor therapy.
Their mutations also offer an opportunity for testing and can-
cer prevention for daughters and sisters. However, a likeli-
hood of 1%, or even 3%, may be below the threshold of con-
sideration for additional testing for most patients. Second,
the chance that an Ashkenazi Jewish patient with breast can-
cer and no BRCA1 or BRCA2 founder mutation carries a dam-
agingmutationinCHEK2oranothermoderatepenetrancegene
is 3% to 4%. Most of these mutations are associated with a
2-fold increase in risk of breast cancer and no increase in risk
of ovarian cancer,13 so they are not likely to affect the treat-
ment of a patient already under care for her breast cancer.
On the other hand, family R (Figure 3) offers an extreme
example of the value of genotyping beyond the 3 founder
alleles. The lesson of family R is that if multiple cases of breast
cancer in a family remain unresolved by the mutation of the
proband, then comprehensive sequencing is strongly sug-
gested to identify other causal mutations. The identification
of CHEK2 mutations in family R likely did not alter treatment
for the patients already diagnosed with breast cancer, but it
was highly informative for the daughters of these patients. The
most recent National Comprehensive Cancer Network guide-
lines recommend that cancer-free carriers of mutations in
CHEK2 and other moderate penetrance genes undertake an-
nual mammography or breast magnetic resonance imaging
with contrast beginning at 40 years of age4 and that they be
awareofamoderateincreaseintheriskofcoloncancer.15These
recommendations are germane for the young women of fam-
ily R who carry a CHEK2 mutation.
Many healthy, cancer-free Ashkenazi Jewish women
have been tested for the Ashkenazi Jewish founder muta-
tions of BRCA1 and BRCA2, with negative (ie, normal) results.
Should these cancer-free women be tested again to identify
any other mutations? The chance that an Ashkenazi Jewish
patient with breast cancer harbors a nonfounder mutation in
BRCA1 or BRCA2 is less than 1%; therefore, the chance that a
cancer-free Ashkenazi Jewish woman harbors such a muta-
tion is much less than 1%. Based on the results of a previous
study,13 the chance that a cancer-free Ashkenazi Jewish
woman carries CHEK2 p.S284F is 1.4%; therefore, the chance
that a cancer-free Ashkenazi Jewish woman carries any
CHEK2 mutation, with a corresponding 2-fold increased risk
of breast cancer, is approximately 1.7%. For cancer-free
Ashkenazi Jewish women with no founder mutation in
BRCA1 or BRCA2 who are particularly concerned with
remaining genetic risk, comprehensive genetic testing with a
multigene panel would identify all CHEK2 mutations, as well
as private mutations in any other gene.
AnadditionalconsiderationforgenetictestingforAshkenazi
Jewish women is the evolution of admixture in Ashkenazi
Jewishpopulations.IntheNewYorkAshkenaziJewishpopula-
tion of the present study, the contribution of founder alleles to
the risk of breast cancer was very strong: 128 of 142 patients
(90.1%) with a mutation in any gene carried an Ashkenazi
Jewishfounderallele,whetherinBRCA1,BRCA2,orCHEK2.The

tional testing for Ashkenazi Jewish women with negative re-
sults for only the BRCA1 and BRCA2 founder alleles.
Limitations
There are 2 limitations to this study. First, because probands
were ascertained for a diagnosis of breast cancer, only genes
known or suspected to harbor mutations increasing the risk
of breast cancer were sequenced. Genes that harbor muta-
tions predisposing to cancers other than breast, such as genes
for Lynch syndrome, were not sequenced. Second, the BROCA
panel enables detection of all mutations in coding regions, un-
translated regions, or introns of all targeted genes, but does
not include sequence for still-unidentified distant regulatory
regions of these genes. Identification of mutations in distant
regulatory regions of cancer genes is an important next step
in genomic analysis of inherited predisposition to cancer.
Conclusions
Among NYBCS participants, approximately half of the pa-
tients with a damaging mutation in any breast cancer gene did
not have a family history suggesting inherited predisposi-
tion. Mutations in these families were likely inherited from fa-
thers, and the combination of small family size and chance in
genetictransmissionyieldedfewfemalerelativescarryingmu-
tant alleles. Therefore, to limit genetic testing to patients with
asuggestivefamilyhistoryistomissabout50%ofpatientswith
actionable mutations. The most recent national screening
guidelines recommend genetic testing for all Ashkenazi Jew-
ish patients with breast cancer.4 This recommendation is fine,

 its the power of precision medicine. To discover a mutation
only after cancer is diagnosed is a missed opportunity to have
prevented that cancer. Many of these cancers could be
prevented by offering genetic testing as described here to all
women before they develop breast cancer, as part of routine
medical care.16
