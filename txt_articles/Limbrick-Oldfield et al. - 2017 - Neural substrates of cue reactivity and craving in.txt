Cue reactivity is an established procedure in addictions research for examining the subjective experience and neural basis of
craving. This experiment sought to quantify cue-related brain responses in gambling disorder using personally tailored cues in
conjunction with subjective craving, as well as a comparison with appetitive non-gambling stimuli. Participants with gambling
disorder (n = 19) attending treatment and 19 controls viewed personally tailored blocks of gambling-related cues, as well as neutral
cues and highly appetitive (food) images during a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan performed ~ 2–3 h after a
usual meal. fMRI analysis examined cue-related brain activity, cue-related changes in connectivity and associations with block-by-
block craving ratings. Craving ratings in the participants with gambling disorder increased following gambling cues compared with
non-gambling cues. fMRI analysis revealed group differences in left insula and anterior cingulate cortex, with the gambling disorder
group showing greater reactivity to the gambling cues, but no differences to the food cues. In participants with gambling disorder,
craving to gamble correlated positively with gambling cue-related activity in the bilateral insula and ventral striatum, and
negatively with functional connectivity between the ventral striatum and the medial prefrontal cortex. Gambling cues, but not food
cues, elicit increased brain responses in reward-related circuitry in individuals with gambling disorder (compared with controls),
providing support for the incentive sensitization theory of addiction. Activity in the insula co-varied with craving intensity, and may
be a target for interventions.

INTRODUCTION
Pathological gambling (now termed gambling disorder) is the first
behavioral addiction to be recognized in the substance-related
and addictive disorders section of the DSM-5. Within this section,
craving was introduced as a criterion for the substance-use
disorder diagnoses, largely based on its value as a biomarker and
predictor of outcomes.1 Craving is not currently listed as a
criterion for gambling disorder, despite the centrality of this
feature to the development and maintenance of the disorder,2
and as a predictor of relapse3 and treatment attrition.4
In addictions research, craving is widely studied using the cue
reactivity procedure, in which participants are exposed to
Pavlovian-conditioned
stimuli
that
are
reliably
paired
with
substance use, such as images of lit cigarettes or hypodermic
needles. The incentive sensitization theory of addiction5,6 posits
that dopaminergic reward circuitry is activated by such cues, and
thus the cue reactivity response in this circuitry is hypothesized to
be increased in groups with substance-use disorders compared
with controls. A meta-analysis of cue reactivity in alcohol use
disorders found increased reactivity in posterior cingulate cortex,
precuneus and superior temporal gyrus,7 suggesting these
regions, although not typically considered part of the reward
network,
may
indeed
be
sensitized.
More
recent
studies
comparing patients with alcohol use disorders with controls have
observed increased reactivity within the reward network, includ-
ing the orbitofrontal cortex,8,9 anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and
ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PFC).9 In addition, correlations
with craving in substance-use disorders have been observed in
the bilateral insula10 and ventral striatum.7
Cue reactivity can also elicit craving responses in individuals
with gambling disorder, as measured by self-report scales and
physiological responses.10,11 However, past experiments assessing
the neural substrates of this cue reactivity with neuroimaging
have revealed mixed results. An early study using auditory
descriptions of gambling scenarios reported a decreased response
in reward-related circuitry (ACC and caudate).11 Three subsequent
studies found effects in the opposite direction, with an increased
response to gambling videos in the dorsolateral PFC, parahippo-
campal gyrus and occipital cortex,12 increased response to
gambling images in occipito-temporal regions, posterior cingulate
cortex, parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala,13 and increased
response in the medial PFC.14 In the latter study, cue reactivity to
gambling
cues
in
individuals
with
gambling
disorder
was
compared with the reactivity to cocaine cues in individuals with
cocaine dependence. The same region of the medial PFC was
activated by cues in the gamblers and the cocaine-dependent

 group. One of the above studies looked for correlations with
subjective cravings, finding that ratings taken after the scan
predicted greater signal change to gambling cues in anterior
insula, PFC and caudate.13 Although not traditionally considered
as part of the reward network, the insula may have a key role here,
as lesions to this region have been associated with an abolished
urge to smoke15 and reduced nicotine withdrawal,16 as well as
with attenuated gambling-related cognitive distortions.17 A direct
connection between the anterior insula and the ventral striatum
has
recently
been
established,18
providing
a
pathway
for
integrating insula processing with the reward network.
One challenge with capturing cue reactivity in gambling
disorder, and a potential reason for the mixed neuroimaging
results untill now, is the greater range and specificity of associated
cues compared with substance-use disorders. As an example,
presentation of lottery cues to regular horse-race gamblers drove
only modest changes in craving, relative to cues associated with
the preferred activity.19 In the present study, we created a
culturally appropriate image set and selected cues that were
relevant to each participant. We predicted that such cues would
elicit craving in a group with gambling disorder, as well as
increased neural activity in reward-related circuitry, relative to
control participants. Within individuals with gambling disorder, we
further hypothesized that insula activity would correlate positively
with craving ratings obtained during the task.
In addition to looking for relative increases or decreases in
activity, we analyzed functional connectivity patterns for the
nucleus accumbens, a region of the ventral striatum that receives
dopaminergic inputs from the midbrain and has bidirectional
connections
with
prefrontal
cortex.20
Impaired
connectivity
between this region and the dorsolateral PFC was previously
associated with craving in patients with alcohol use disorders,21
and this circuit is implicated in the cognitive control of craving in
smokers.22 We predicted that regions of the PFC would show
decreased connectivity with the nucleus accumbens in the group
with gambling disorder, and that within the patient group, craving
would be associated with reduced connectivity between nucleus
accumbens and the PFC.
Our cue reactivity procedure also included a set of high-caloric
sweet food images as a ‘natural’ reward. There is considerable
overlap in the neural response to food cues and drug cues. A meta-
analysis comparing the neural response to smoking cues and food
cues found overlapping activation of the striatum, insula and
orbitofrontal cortex.10 More recently, overlapping reactivity has been
observed for multiple types of drug cues, natural rewards (including
food and sex) and gambling. Regions responsive to all cues include
the striatum, the anterior cingulate and the insula.23 Neural
responsivity to food cues is modulated by multiple factors including
motivational state and food-cue palatability.24 It is not yet known if
food-cue reactivity is altered in gambling disorder. The reward-
deficiency hypothesis of addiction vulnerability posits a reduction in
reward-related activity across multiple types of rewards.25,26 Recent
experiments have indicated blunted sensitivity to ‘natural’ rewards
in gambling disorder27 and nicotine dependence,28 in line with
reward deficiency, and we sought to corroborate these findings in
our own data, using highly appetitive food cues.29
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
Individuals with gambling disorder (n = 20, all male) were recruited from
the National Problem Gambling Clinic, London, and healthy controls
(n = 22, all male) were recruited through community advertisements.
Sample
size
was
informed
by
power
calculations.
Between-group
comparisons in groups with 20 participants have a power of 0.80 to
detect an effect size of ~ 0.9, which is a plausible effect size based on
previous literature.30 Gambling disorder was confirmed using DSM-IV
criteria (for pathological gambling) and corroborated by scores ⩾ 8 on the
Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI).31 See Supplementary Information
1 for full inclusion criteria. Patients were scanned while awaiting or
undergoing psychological treatment for gambling disorder, and had been
abstinent from gambling for a median of 31 days (range = 2–120 days)
before testing. All but one control participant scored zero on the PGSI, with
this participant scoring two. The UK National Research Ethics Committee
approved the protocol, and all volunteers provided written informed
consent. These data were collected as part of a larger study including
multiple functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tasks and positron
emission tomography scans.32 One gambling disorder and two control
participants were excluded due to excess motion during the functional
scans. Excess motion was defined using two criteria: first, a maximum
frame-wise displacement 44 mm and second, more than 10% of volumes
identified as containing extreme intensity difference values by the dvars
metric of FSLMotionOutliers. These criteria were established before the
analysis. This combination of criteria ensured that participants with just
one large movement would not be excluded. Of those included, only two
participants had a maximum frame-wise displacement 42 mm, and all
were
o3 mm.
One
additional
control
was
excluded
because
of
incomplete data. Thus, our analyses include data from 19 individuals with
gambling disorder and 19 controls.
Participants completed the Beck depression inventory (BDI-II),33 the
Spielberger state-trait anxiety index (STAI),34 the Fagerstrom test for
nicotine dependence (FTND)35 and the alcohol use disorders identification
test (AUDIT).36 Current and lifetime psychiatric disorders were assessed using
the mini international neuropsychiatric interview (MINI-5)37 administered by a
psychiatrist. As a result of this interview, no participants were diagnosed with
a current psychiatric illness (excluding gambling disorder) in line with our
inclusion criteria. Intelligence quotient (IQ) was assessed using the vocabulary
and matrix reasoning subtests of the Wechsler abbreviated scale of
intelligence.38 Potential disordered eating behavior was measured using
the Eating disorder examination questionnaire,39 Dutch eating behaviour
questionnaire40 and three factor eating questionnaire41 with a focus on the
restraint subscales, which we have seen to predict reward network activity
during food picture evaluation (Goldstone, unpublished data).
Procedures
Brain images were acquired on a Siemens 3T scanner (Supplementary
Information 2). Four categories of photographs were shown to participants
during the MRI scan: gambling cues, gambling-matched neutral cues, food
cues, and food-matched neutral cues (Figure 1). There were four subtypes
of gambling cues: photographs of the shop-fronts of bookmakers from the
UK high street, as well as ‘action’ images from the three most common
preferred forms of gambling among our clients: electronic roulette, sports
betting and slot machines. For each participant, we selected the two forms
most relevant to their personal game preferences, as well as the shop-
fronts. The ubiquity of betting shops in the UK that offer multiple forms of
gambling (including electronic gaming machines and sports betting)
means that shop-fronts themselves may be powerful cues, as shown for
branded gambling advertisements.42 Fourteen patients were shown the
roulette and sports images, and five were shown the roulette and slot
machine images. The task design was matched for the controls as closely
as possible (15 roulette and sports, 4 roulette and slot machines).
Gambling-matched neutral cues were selected in a pairwise manner to the
gambling cues, based on the presence of faces, hands, actions, electronic
devices, touch screens and overall composition. Images of bookmaker
shop-fronts were paired with shop-fronts that had no associations with
gambling. Neutral cues matched to the food cues included pictures of
objects such as furniture and clothing.
Both the gambling cues and their matched neutral cues were either
taken locally by the experimenters or purchased from a stock image
company. Food cues were close ups of sweet foods used in previous fMRI
studies.29,43 To control for the (known) impact on fasting on neural
responses to food,29,43 and the potential impact of fasting on neural
response to gambling cues, we instructed participants to eat a light meal
~ 2 h before the scan (Table 1). The cue reactivity task commenced
between 10:44 hours and 15:50 hours in the control participants, and
between 11:16 hours and 15:53 hours for the gambling disorder group.
Participants were allowed to smoke nicotine on the day of the test session,
up to two hours before the start of the task.
Stimuli
were
presented
in
a

design
(Supplementary
Information 3). Each block contained five images from the same category,
presented for 4.8 s per image. To maintain attention, participants were
asked to press a button with each new image. Three control participants

 did not adhere to this instruction, but all results remain qualitatively
unchanged in sensitivity analyses excluding these three participants
(Supplementary Information 4). Rest blocks consisted of a fixation cross for
24 s. At the end of each block, participants gave a craving rating (‘I crave
gambling right now’) 44 from strongly disagree (one) to strongly agree
(nine), with a 5 s time limit. Thus, participants provided gambling craving
ratings after each cue condition and rest block, to assess if craving was
specific to the gambling cues or generalized across conditions. We also
asked participants to rate their craving to gamble before they entered the
scanner, to establish a baseline craving score. Participants were instructed
to imagine that they were in the place pictured in each photograph or
interacting with the item shown. There were two runs of the task, each
lasting 7.5 min.
Data analysis
Demographic and clinical characteristics were analyzed using R (R core
Team, Vienna, Austria) using unpaired t-tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests
(two-tailed). Analyses of the craving ratings were carried out using two
mixed design ANOVAs. The first tested for any difference in the ratings
after the three types of non-gambling cues. The second tested for
differences after gambling cues, non-gambling cues and rest. Greenhouse-
Geisser correction was applied to all ANOVA within-subject contrasts
where the assumption of sphericity had been violated. For those data
where the assumption of normality had been violated, a robust ANOVA
using trimmed means was carried out.45 For all models, the robust ANOVA
revealed qualitatively the same results and so are not reported here. To
establish if craving within the patients with gambling disorder was

 elevated throughout the task, baseline craving ratings taken before the
scan were compared with rest block craving ratings within the task using a
Wilcoxon signed-rank test (two-tailed).
fMRI data were analysed using the FMRIB Software Library (FSL). See
Supplementary Information 5 for full details of the pre-processing. Two
statistical analyses were carried out using a general linear model (GLM)
approach in FEAT (FSL Expert Analysis Tool). The first was an activity
analysis and the second a psychophysical interaction (PPI) functional
connectivity analysis. For the activity analysis, a model of the experimental
events was constructed by convolving the onset and duration of the cue
blocks with a gamma haemodynamic response function (with a time-to-
peak of 6 s) at the individual subject level. A single boxcar regressor was
created for each cue type (gambling, neutral, food, food-matched neutral).
Six standard motion regressors were also entered into the model. FSL
Motion Outliers was used to identify volumes with large intensity changes
remaining after motion correction using the dvars metric.46 A single
regressor for each identified volume was also entered into the model on a
subject-by-subject basis. Four contrasts were specified: gambling cues4
gambling-matched neutral cues, food cues4food-matched neutral cues,
gambling-matched neutral cues4gambling cues and food-matched
neutral cues4food cues. Note that, while we collapsed across the non-
gambling cue types for the analysis of the behavioral ratings, we did not
collapse across the non-gambling cues for the imaging analysis. For the
functional connectivity analysis, the GLM was expanded to include PPI
regressors. The bilateral nucleus accumbens seed region was defined using
FSL FIRST at the individual subject level on the T1-weighted structural
scans. A mean time course from this seed region was extracted for each
run for each subject, and entered as a physiological regressor in the GLM.
PPI regressors were then created by multiplying the (demeaned)
physiological regressor with the task regressors. A PPI term was included
for each condition, but only the gambling-related contrasts were included
in this model.
For each GLM, the results of the two runs for each participant were
combined using a fixed effects model. Group statistics were then carried
out using FLAME (FMRIB’s local analysis of mixed effects). For each of the
lower-level contrasts, the mean result of the gambling disorder group was
inspected, and two contrasts were carried out to examine (unpaired) group
differences (gambling disorder4controls and controls4gambling dis-
order). Whole-brain group-level statistics were corrected for family-wise
error
using
cluster-based
thresholding
(Z = 2.3,
Po0.05).
For
each
significant cluster of activity, the peak voxel is reported in MNI coordinates
(x, y, z). For the functional connectivity analysis, a pre-threshold mask was
used to restrict the analysis to the prefrontal cortex, the insula and the
striatum (covering 553 632 mm3) as our a priori regions of interest
concerned connectivity between the nucleus accumbens and these
regions. For any observed group differences, FSLs Featquery was used to
interrogate the direction of the effects. For this, the median percent signal
change within the cluster was calculated at the first level of the GLM for
each participant.
In both the activity and connectivity analyses, we explored individual
differences within the gambling disorder group as a function of the mean
craving rating (following the gambling blocks), gambling severity (PGSI)
and number of days abstinent. We also included the clinical measures that
differed between our groups (see ‘Results’ section) to ensure any observed
group differences were not explained by these differences. All individual
difference measures were demeaned and included as covariates in a
group-level analysis.
RESULTS
Group characteristics
The groups did not differ significantly on age, IQ or dietary
restraint scores. Participants with gambling disorder scored
significantly higher on the BDI-II, STAI and AUDIT (Table 1), but
did not meet criteria for current depression, anxiety or alcohol
dependence. The gambling disorder group also scored higher on
body mass index, with two of the patients scoring over 30. All fMRI
contrasts using the food cues were unchanged with the removal
of these two participants. The two groups were matched for
number of smokers, but of the participants who did smoke, the
gambling
disorder
group
scored
higher
than
the
control
participants on the FTND.
Craving ratings
Figure 2 shows the craving ratings after each experimental
condition. We first confirmed that there was no significant
difference between the craving ratings following the three non-
gambling cue types, main effect: F(1.45, 52.31) = 0.81, P = 0.42, Cue
type by Group interaction: F(1.45, 52.31) = 2.34, P = 0.12. Therefore,
we averaged these ratings for the non-gambling blocks for the
omnibus ANOVA of context (gambling cues, non-gambling cues,
rest) by group. This analysis revealed a significant context × group
interaction (F(1.25, 45.01) = 11.06, Po0.001), driven by increased
craving in the gambling disorder group following gambling cues
relative to both neutral cues, F(1, 36) = 24.38, Po0.001 and rest
blocks, F(1, 36) = 20.47, Po0.001, as well as significant main
effects of group (gambling disorder4controls, F(1, 36) = 23.56,
Po0.001) and context, F(1.25, 45.01) = 21.15, Po0.001. Within the
patient group, craving ratings did not increase significantly from
the pre-scan baseline (median = 2) to the resting blocks (median =
2.33, P = 0.48, r = 0.16).
fMRI: cue reactivity
Activity analysis.
The contrast of gambling4gambling-matched
neutral cues revealed three clusters of activity within the gambling
disorder group (Figure 3). A large cluster had local maxima within
the left posterior cingulate gyrus, the left superior frontal gyrus,
the left frontal pole and extended to multiple regions including
the bilateral ventral striatum and medial PFC. Two additional
clusters were observed with peaks within the left angular gyrus
and right lateral occipital cortex. See Supplementary Figure 1 for
the results of this contrast within the control group.
Compared with controls, individuals with gambling disorder
showed
increased
activity
to
gambling4gambling-matched
neutral cues in four clusters, including left insula/frontal oper-
culum and ACC/superior frontal gyrus (Figures 4a–c). Inspection of
the extracted signal from these regions revealed that, compared
with the implicit rest baseline, these regions showed a decrease in
activity during neutral blocks in both groups of participants, but

 during gambling blocks only the control participants showed this
reduction.
In the gambling disorder group, the contrast of food4food-
matched neutral cues revealed two clusters of activity in the
occipital pole and the right insula (Supplementary Figure 2). We
observed no significant group differences between gambling
disorder and control groups in the food4food-matched neutral
cue contrast. In light of the modest food-cue reactivity responses
observed within the gambling disorder group, and the absence of
a significant group difference, a follow-up analysis was performed
to further test whether we had elicited food-cue reactivity. We
combined gambling disorder and control participants to look for
an overall appetitive response to the food stimuli. This identified
significant clusters in occipital cortex (−8, − 96, 2, Z = 9.15),
paracingulate gyrus (−14, 48, 4, Z = 5.27), insula (38, 8, − 14,
Z = 4.84), ACC (−2, − 14, 30, Z = 3.77) and deactivations (that is,
foodoneutral) in left (42, − 72, 20, Z = 5.68) and right (42, − 72, 20,
Z = 5.68) lateral occipital cortex (Supplementary Figure 3).
Connectivity analysis.
In the gambling disorder group, the
contrast of gambling4gambling-matched neutral cues revealed
increased functional connectivity between the nucleus accum-
bens and the right inferior frontal gyrus (52, 24, 2, Z = 3.97)
(Supplementary Figure 4). In the direct group comparison, the
participants with gambling disorder showed increased functional
connectivity compared with controls, between the nucleus
accumbens and two clusters: left insula cortex extending to left
putamen, and superior frontal gyrus (Figures 4d–f). Inspection of
the extracted signal from these regions revealed this effect was
driven by the gambling disorder group showing relatively
decreased connectivity during the neutral blocks, and controls
showing relatively increased connectivity.
fMRI: clinical correlations
To ensure our group differences were not driven by the clinical
measures that differed between our groups we considered
entering BDI-II, STAI, AUDIT and FTND into this analysis. We could
not include FTND due to the small proportion of those participants
who were smokers. BDI-II and STAI were strongly correlated
(Supplementary Table 1), and so, of these measures, only BDI-II
was entered. Similarly, a significant negative correlation was
observed between craving ratings and days abstinent (r = − 0.53,
N = 19, P = 0.019); whereas this provides external validity to our
cravings measure, it precluded the further inclusion of length of
abstinence as a correlated regressor. We therefore tested for
neuroimaging correlations with the following clinical variables in
the gambling disorder group: craving scores, BDI-II, AUDIT
and PGSI.
Activity analysis.
Mean craving ratings in the gambling disorder
group
predicted
greater
activity
for
gambling4gambling-
matched neutral cues in three clusters: the right insula, the left
central operculum/ left insula and the cerebellum (Figure 5a).
Higher BDI-II scores also predicted greater activity to gambling4-
gambling-matched neutral cues in left frontal pole (−2, 70, 12,
Z = 4.89), left postcentral gyrus (−66, − 20, 26, Z = 4.63) and
cerebellum (−38, − 70, − 22, Z = 3.60). Several cue reactivity studies
in substance-use disorders have reported a correlation between
subjective craving and activity in the ventral striatum.7 In a
supplementary test using the nucleus accumbens region-of-
interest (as defined for the connectivity analysis), a significant
correlation between the signal change in the gambling4gam-
bling-matched neutral cues contrast and craving ratings was
observed in the gambling disorder group (Figure 5b). No regions
showed any correlations with AUDIT or PGSI scores.
Connectivity analysis.
For the functional connectivity analysis,
higher craving ratings were associated with reduced connectivity
between nucleus accumbens and medial PFC (Figure 5c). Higher

Cue-related activity to gambling4gambling-matched neutral contrast in the gambling disorder group. We observed three clusters
of activity that showed a relative activity increase for gambling cues compared with gambling-matched neutral cues. An extensive cluster
(covering 57 425 voxels in 2 mm standard space) extended to multiple brain regions, and so we report local maxima (Z46.5). Peaks were
localized to the left (−2, − 42, 28, Z = 7.14) and right (−4, − 32, 32, Z = 6.75) posterior cingulate gyrus, the left superior frontal gyrus (−2, 46, 50,
Z = 7.08), the left frontal pole ((−4, 50, 46, Z = 7.01) and (−4, 58, 4, Z = 6.81)) and the left paracingulate gyrus (−12, 50, 12, Z = 6.54). Two smaller
clusters showed peaks within the left angular gyrus (−52, − 52, 40, Z = 6.33) and the right lateral occipital cortex (62, − 58, 34, Z = 4.09). All

 most commonly reported problematic forms of gambling were
electronic roulette and sports gambling, and our gambling cues
were individually tailored to game preferences. Ratings taken on a
block-by-block basis during scanning confirmed that craving was
reliably induced by our gambling cues, and these cravings were
specific to both cue type (relative to neutral, food and rest blocks)
and the participants with gambling disorder. The gambling blocks
in our task elicited strong whole-brain level activations across
subcortical,
limbic
and
cortical
(occipital,
temporal,
frontal)
networks. Our gambling disorder group showed specific increases
(group × cue interactions) in this neural reactivity in anterior
cingulate and insula.
Within the gambling disorder group, activity in bilateral insula
(whole brain) and nucleus accumbens (region-of-interest) was
significantly associated with craving. As the mean level of craving
increased, the reactivity of these regions to gambling cues
(relative to neutral cues) increased. Within the insula, this activity
was localized to the mid and posterior regions, which have been

Group differences in gambling cue reactivity. Top panel: (a) Activity differences. The gambling disorder group showed increased
activity relative to controls, in the gambling4gambling-matched-neutral contrast, in four clusters. One peaked within the anterior cingulate
cortex (−2, 22, 28, Z = 3.85), extending to the superior frontal gyrus. One peaked in the left frontal operculum (−48, 16, − 4, Z = 3.56) extending
to the left insula, one peaked in the right inferior frontal gyrus (52, − 52, − 26, Z = 4.33). An additional cluster was observed in the cerebellum
(−16, − 48, − 42, Z = 4.45), (b) extracted signal from the operculum/insula cluster, (c) extracted signal from the anterior cingulate cluster.
Bottom panel: (d) Functional connectivity differences. The gambling disorder group showed increased connectivity changes, in the
gambling4gambling-matched neutral contrast, between the nucleus accumbens and two clusters; one peaked within the left insula (−34, 6,

Correlations between craving ratings and gambling cue reactivity (gambling4neutral contrast) within the gambling disorder group.
The whole-brain activity analysis (a) revealed three clusters showing a positive correlation, one peaked within the right insula (38, 4, 8,
Z = 5.84), a second within left central operculum (−44, − 4, 10, Z = 5.32) extending to the left insula and a third in the cerebellum (−10, − 40,

 associated with primary interoception, as opposed to anterior
insula, which is implicated in higher-level aspects of interoceptive
awareness.47,48 In addition, the gambling disorder group showed
increased connectivity between nucleus accumbens and left mid-
insula. These findings fit with neurological studies showing that
strokes affecting the insula can disrupt nicotine addiction,15,16 as
well as susceptibility to gambling-related cognitive distortions.17
Moreover, meta-analyses of fMRI cue reactivity demonstrate insula
recruitment in patients with substance-use disorders,10 primarily
in more elaborate procedures involving polymodal cues.49
To our knowledge, this paper is the first to investigate
functional connectivity changes in gambling disorder during a
cue reactivity task. Although a reliable group difference was not
observed in the ventral striatum in the activity analysis, significant
increases were observed in the gambling disorder group in
functional connectivity between nucleus accumbens and insula.
Furthermore, individual differences were observed in connectivity
strength within the gamblers, as a function of cravings and
depression. Patients who reported higher levels of craving in
response to the gambling cues showed reduced connectivity
between the nucleus accumbens and the medial PFC. Reduced
activation in the medial PFC has previously been observed in
cocaine use disorders during a rewarded cue reactivity task.50
Using a cognitive appraisal manipulation in smokers to focus on
the short-term or long-term consequences of smoking, Kober
et al.22 reported increases in medial and dorsolateral PFC activity,
coupled with decreases in ventral striatal activity and both effects
correlated with changes in craving. Disruptions of the prefrontal
cortical control over the limbic system, giving rise to disinhibited,
impulsive behavior is a central tenet of modern addiction
models.51,52 Changes in functional connectivity tied to cravings
provide a direct instantiation of such hypotheses in the context of
gambling disorder.
Craving was also correlated with length of abstinence in our
sample: as abstinence increased, the craving elicited by the
gambling
cues
decreased,
replicating
previous
findings
in
gambling disorder53
(although
we
note
that
in substance
addictions, this effect is not always observed54 or can be non-
linear55). One interpretation is that length of abstinence is a
modulator of neural activity (c.f. ref. 56) and should be examined
as such in future studies in gambling disorder. Importantly, overall
gambling severity (on PGSI) did not predict either craving or
neural activity. Whereas craving and abstinence reflect current
clinical
state,
the
PGSI
score
emphasizes
gambling
harms
(primarily financial consequences) across the last 12 months.
Our results contrast with a previous cue reactivity experiment in
gambling disorder showing reduced activity in medial PFC using
script-induced imagery.11 Some salient methodological differ-
ences may account for this discrepancy, including clinical status
(community-recruited
gamblers
in
the
earlier
study
versus
abstinent gamblers in treatment) and mode of cueing. In
neuroimaging studies across the addictions, an increased neural
response is typically observed when Pavlovian-conditioned stimuli
are presented directly within the task.57
As a strength, our experiment included an appetitive control
condition in an effort to arbitrate between two psychological
theories of addiction. The incentive senitization theory5 predicts
an increased response in reward-related circuitry to addiction-
related
cues,
but
is
agnostic
in
the
response
to
natural
rewards.24,57 In contrast, the reward-deficiency hypothesis predicts
a generalized decreased response to both addiction-related and
natural rewards. Past experiments in addicted groups have
supported the reward-deficiency account of the response to
natural rewards. This
includes a blunted response to the
anticipation
of
erotic
imagery
in
patients
with
gambling
disorder,27 to erotic imagery in cocaine dependence58 and to
food cues in smokers.28 Our results are more in line with incentive
sensitization. We observed an increased cue reactivity response to
gambling stimuli, but this did not transfer to any group differences
in response to the appetitive food cues. Nevertheless, this null
result must be interpreted with appropriate caution. The cue
reactivity network we observed in response to food cues was less
extensive than the equivalent response to gambling cues. These
responses typically vary by hunger levels, such that fasted
participants show an amplified response compared with fed
participants.29,43 Our participants ate a small meal 2 h before the
MRI scan, and the results may have been affected by this
motivational state. This decision to not increase the fasting time
before the scan was driven by evidence that gambling-related
decision making is modulated by hunger state,59 an effect which
may
have
confounded
the
response
to
gambling
stimuli
throughout the fMRI session. In addition, we did not collect food
craving ratings during our task, and were therefore unable to look
for within-group correlations of the reward network with food
craving ratings. Future work might reveal modulations of this
network in gambling disorder by scanning participants in a fasted
state and obtaining food craving ratings during the task.
Concerning
our
between-groups
analysis,
we
compared
patients with gambling disorder to healthy controls who, although
matched on many dimensions, differed significantly on measures
of depression, anxiety, alcohol use and smoking, as is typically the
case for gambling disorder.60 To investigate whether the group
differences we observed might actually be driven by these group
differences, we entered BDI and AUDIT scores into correlational
analyses within the gambling disorder group. There was no
overlap in the areas that were activated in our between-group
contrasts and regions correlating with BDI or AUDIT scores,
suggesting our group differences were not driven by these
measures. However to more thoroughly test this, future research
should use control participants matched for these common
comorbidities. Moreover, future work on gambling cravings would
benefit from comparing patients with gambling disorder against
regular (but non-problematic) gamblers, to address the more
tailored question of why some people can gamble regularly
without escalation to problematic gambling, whereas others
cannot.61 Similarly, it would be fruitful to directly compare cue
reactivity in patients with gambling disorder and substance-use
disorders using this paradigm,14 to characterize the degree of
overlap in cravings responses.
In conclusion, the present study characterizes cue-related
neural activity in gambling disorder, delineating changes in
regional activity and connectivity, as well as the specificity to
addiction-related stimuli over natural rewards. In particular, the
close relationships between cue-related neural activity in the
insula and individual differences in subjective craving may have
clinical utility for examining changes over the course of treatment,
as previously seen for alcohol use disorders.62 Moreover, novel
experimental therapeutics such as transcranial magnetic stimula-
tion to deep structures may be capable of reducing insula activity,
and are being trialed for treatment of cravings in nicotine
dependence.63 In formulating the DSM-5 criteria for substance-use
disorders, the addition of craving as a diagnostic criteria was
motivated less by its leverage in diagnosis, but rather by its value
as a useful biomarker for treatment.1 Similarities in the neural
substrates of cue reactivity between gambling disorder and in
substance-use disorders supports the inclusion of craving in future
revisions of diagnostic criteria for gambling disorder.
