Objectives. To investigate whether less-healthy work–family life histories contribute
to the higher cardiovascular disease prevalence in older American compared with Euro-
pean women.
Methods. We used sequence analysis to identify distinct work–family typologies for
women born between 1935 and 1956 in the United States and 13 European countries.
Data came from the US Health and Retirement Study (1992–2006) and the Survey of
Health, Aging, and Retirement in Europe (2004–2009).
Results. Work–family typologies were similarly distributed in the United States and
Europe. Being a lone working mother predicted a higher risk of heart disease, stroke, and
smoking among American women, and smoking for European women. Lone working
motherhood was more common and had a marginally stronger association with stroke in
the United States than in Europe. Simulations indicated that the higher stroke risk among
American women would only be marginally reduced if American women had experienced
the same work–family trajectories as European women.
Conclusions. Combining work and lone motherhood was more common in the United
States, but differences in work–family trajectories explained only a small fraction of the
higher cardiovascular risk of American relative to European women. (Am J Public Health.
2016;106:1449–1456. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2016.303264)
L
ife expectancy is shorter in the United
States than in many Western European
countries. Older Americans are also more
likely to report poorer health and to suffer
chronic conditions, particularly American
women.1,2 Explanations for this so-called US
health disadvantage include differences in the
prevalence of smoking and other behavioral
risk factors, rates of disease and injury,
financial barriers to health care access, and
psychosocial stress.2–6 Although higher
smoking prevalence histories among older
women in the United States is one of the
driving explanations,3 none of these factors
fully accounts for the female US health
disadvantage.
Lives of American women changed sub-
stantially in the second half of the previous
century. Female labor force participation in-
creased more in the United States than in many
European countries,7 and marriage rates
decreased more rapidly for US women as a re-
sult of a higher fraction of American women
never marrying as well as higher divorce rates.8,9
By contrast, although fertility rates declined
in all countries,10 they declined less in the
UnitedStatesthan inmanyEuropeancountries,
leaving more American women facing the
prospect of combining work and family roles,
often in the context of lone motherhood.
Women who are married, employed, and
have children are generally healthier than
their unmarried, nonemployed, and childless
counterparts.11,12 Whereas the role accu-
mulation theory suggests that combining
family and work roles is beneficial for
women’s health, the multiple role theory
poses that combining these roles may increase
levels of stress, which has a negative impact
on health.13 These negative impacts may,
however, depend on the availability of sup-
portive policies that enable parents to com-
bine work with family roles.
We hypothesized that work–family tra-
jectories may be differentially related to car-
diovascular health in the United States than in
Europe, as a result of the different work–
family policy environment in the United
States and Europe. If combining family and
work roles is beneficial for a woman’s health,
women experiencing a more family-friendly
policy environment such as that in Europe
may benefit more from role accumulation,
resulting in better cardiovascular health. If
combining roles is detrimental for a woman’s
health, American women may experience
more strain from work–family stress than
European women as a result of a less
supportive policy environment in the
United States.
The aim of this study was to assess whether
less-healthy work–family life histories among
American women have contributed to their
cardiovascular health disadvantage in older
age relative to women in 13 European

 countries. We used unique retrospective data
for 13 European countries and the United
States to construct full life histories and work–
family trajectories, and linked them to stroke
and heart disease outcomes in older ages. We
examined the association between work–
family trajectories and late-life cardiovascular
outcomes and assessed whether the distri-
bution and risks associated with these work–
family trajectories explain why older
American women have higher stroke and
heart disease prevalence than older women in
Europe.
METHODS
We used data from the Survey of Health,
Aging, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE)
for 13 European countries (Austria, Belgium,
Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Ger-
many, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Poland,
Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland). SHARE is
a longitudinal biennial survey designed to
provide insight into the lives of Europeans
aged 50 years and older and their spouses.14
For SHARE, representative samples of
noninstitutionalized adults aged 50 years
and older in each European country were
selected and interviewed in the household.
The SHARE survey included approxi-
mately 30 000 respondents at each wave.
The third wave of SHARE (2008–2009,
“SHARELIFE”) was specifically designed to
gather information on retrospective life histo-
ries.15 We used these data to construct mar-
riage, employment, and maternal histories over
the life course and to derivate work–family
trajectories for each individual.16 Complete
work–family trajectories were available for
14 545 European women. We restricted our
sample to women born between 1935 and
1956 (n = 10 569 women). We linked the
work–family typologies of these women to
self-reported data on chronic diseases and risk
factors measured in 2006 (n = 9456), and to
data on their educational attainment from
either the 2004 or the 2006 wave of SHARE
(n = 9047). Because educational attainment
was only asked during the baseline interview,
we used educational information from the
2004 wave for those women who also par-
ticipated in the earlier wave. Information on
age and country of residence was available for
all remaining women in our sample.
For the United States, we used data from
the Health and Retirement Study (HRS),
a longitudinal biennial survey of American
adults aged 50 years and older.17 The HRS
incorporated a representative sample of the
noninstitutionalized population aged 50 years
and older, and it included approximately
20 000 respondents every 2 years. We
reconstructed marital, employment, and
maternal histories by using retrospective re-
ports collected at the baseline HRS interview.
We then complemented these histories with
the respondent’s self-reports from successive
waves of HRS from 1992 to 2006. In total,
complete life histories were available for 7681
American women born between 1935 and
1956. We then linked the work–family
typologies to chronic diseases and risk factors
measured in the HRS interview in 2006,
leaving 5985 women. To avoid that our US
results would be driven by racial disparities in
cardiovascular risk factors and chronic dis-
eases,18,19 we controlled for race (non-
Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks,
and other races).
We categorized educational attainment
by using the International Standard Classifi-
cation of Education (ISCED)20 scale into 4
levels: ISCED levels 0 and 1 (less than high
school), ISCED level 2 (high school or
equivalent), ISCED levels 3 and 4 (some
college), and ISCED levels 5 and 6 (college or
above). The distribution of educational at-
tainment in the US and European sample
can be found in Table A (available as a sup-
plement to the online version of this article
at http://www.ajph.org).
We defined work–family trajectories on
the basis of 3 dimensions: marriage, em-
ployment, and child histories. Participants
were asked about starting and ending dates of
all marriages and of jobs, and birth dates of
children. Questions were similar for the
American and European samples. We used
binary variables to keep the maximum
number of combinations manageable. We
defined employment status as having a paid
job, maternity status as having at least 1 child
younger than 18 years, and marital status as
being married versus nonmarried (widowed,
divorced, and never married).
We focused on 2 major chronic diseases
shown to be more prevalent in the United
States than in European countries: heart
disease and stroke.21 Participants were asked
whether they had received a doctor’s di-
agnosis for any of these conditions. We also
incorporated diagnosed high blood pressure,
whether individuals had ever smoked, and
body mass index (BMI) based on self-reported
weight in kilograms divided by height in
meters squared. A respondent was classified as
being obese if her BMI was 30 or higher. The
mean and range of BMI for both samples can
be found in Table A. The exact questions
asked to the European and American re-
spondents are presented in Table B (available
as a supplement to the online version of this
article at http://www.ajph.org).
Sequence Analysis
To identify common work–family
typologies in our data, we used sequence
analysis, an approach that enabled us to
identify work–family typologies derived from
full work–family histories.22 For each
woman, we determined the work–family
situation on the basis of 8 possible combi-
nations of employment status (working for
pay: yes or no), marital status (married: yes or
no), and maternal status (at least 1 child
younger than 18 years: yes or no) at each age
between 16 and 50 years. This means that, for
each woman, and on the basis of retrospective
reports, we assigned a work–family combi-
nation for each year of life between the ages of
16 and 50 years. The analysis then used the
timing and duration of each work–family
combination to derive common trajectories.
A detailed description of sequence analysis is
included in Figure A (available as a supple-
ment to the online version of this article at
http://www.ajph.org). An application of
sequence analysis in a similar context is
also available elsewhere.23
For the analysis, we pooled US and Eu-
ropean data. In total, we found 15 542 distinct
life trajectories for the 18 250 women in our
sample. To define the optimal number of
typologies, we used different cluster cut-off
criteria, including the Point Biserial Corre-
lation and the Calinski–Harabasz index
(Table C, available as a supplement to the
online version of this article at http://www.
ajph.org).24 On the basis of these criteria, we
established that both 5 and 6 typologies best
suited the data. The 5 typologies solution
provided more (sociologically) meaningful
and argumentative typologies; the 6

 typologies solution had an unclear and less
argumentative pattern (Figure C, available as
a supplement to the online version of this
article at http://www.ajph.org). We there-
fore focused our main interpretation on the
5 typologies solution. We conducted the
sequence analysis by using the TraMineR and
Weighted Cluster packages in R version 3.2.1
(R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria).24,25
Statistical Analysis
We used logistic regression to estimate the
difference in cardiovascular disease and risk
factors of American compared with European
women. We examined whether the distri-
bution of the work–family typologies differed
between American and European women.
We used logistic regression to model car-
diovascular diseases and risk factors as
a function of work–family typology with
control for race in the United States, age
(indicated by 5-year age intervals), educa-
tional attainment, whether women resided in
the United States or Europe, and European
country of residence. To assess whether as-
sociations between work–family typology
and cardiovascular outcomes differed be-
tween the United States and Europe, we used
a Wald test for the interaction between work–
family typology and region of residence. To
assess the contribution of work–family
typology to chronic disease and risk factors
between the United States and Europe, we
combined estimates from the logistic models
with the observed distribution of women
over the typologies in the United States
and Europe. This enabled us to obtain the
probabilities of each outcome for US women,
under the counterfactual scenario that they
had been exposed to the same distribution of
and cardiovascular risk associated with each
typology as European women. We have
applied this approach before.26
We conducted all statistical analyses with
Stata SE version 13 (StataCorp LP, College
Station, TX).
RESULTS
American women had poorer cardiovas-
cular health and less-healthy risk-factor pro-
files than women in Europe (Figure 1), as
indicated by an increased odds for all out-
comes, particularly for having had a diagnosis
of heart disease (odds ratio [OR] = 2.74; 95%
confidence interval [CI] = 2.43, 3.10) or
stroke (OR = 2.21; 95% CI = 1.75, 2.79).
Work–Family Typologies Over the
Life Course
The most common work–family typology
comprised married mothers who returned to
work after a few years of nonemployment
(28%), and the least common typology
comprised working single mothers (8%;
Figure 2). In both the United States and
Europe, about 10% of women were single,
working, childless women (typology 1, 10%
in the United States, 11% in Europe).
Twenty-five percent of American women
were stay-home married mothers (typology
2), compared with 29% of European women.
A larger proportion of American (11%) than
European (5%) women was classified as
working single mothers (typology 3). More
American (31%) than European women
(25%) were married mothers that returned to
work after a few years of nonemployment
(typology 4). More European (29%) than
American (23%) women were working
married mothers (typology 5). Distributions
of age, educational attainment, and reported
cardiovascular risk factors and chronic diseases
by typology are presented in Table D
(available as a supplement to the online
version of this article at http://www.ajph.
org).
Cardiovascular Disease and
Risk Factors
Working, single, childless women had
lower odds of having high blood pressure than
working married mothers (Table 1;
OR = 0.84; 95% CI = 0.74, 0.96). Compared
with working married mothers, nonworking
married mothers had significantly lower odds
of having ever smoked (OR = 0.85; 95%
CI = 0.76, 0.96), but higher odds of being
obese (OR = 1.12; 95% CI = 1.01, 1.25).
Working single mothers had higher odds of
heart disease (OR = 1.40; 95% CI = 1.14,
1.71), stroke (OR = 1.74; 95% CI = 1.22,
2.47), and smoking (OR = 1.77; 95%
CI = 1.50, 2.09). Married mothers who
left work and subsequently returned to work
after a few years had higher odds of stroke
(OR = 1.35; 95% CI = 1.03, 1.77) compared
with working married mothers.
There was no consistent pattern suggesting
that certain typologies were systematically
more harmful for American than European
women. In Europe, working, single, childless
women were less likely to have high blood
pressure (OR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.66, 0.92)

 but more likely to have smoked (OR = 1.37;
95% CI = 1.07, 1.75) than working married
mothers. These associations were not signif-
icant in the United States (OR = 0.94; 95%
CI = 0.77, 1.15 and OR = 1.11; 95%
CI = 0.91, 1.35 for high blood pressure and
smoking, respectively). The odds of stroke
among working single mothers compared
with married working mothers were higher in
the United States (OR = 2.09; 95%
CI = 1.36, 1.64) than in Europe (OR = 0.88;
95% CI = 0.39, 1.97). The odds for
smoking among working single mothers
compared with married working mothers
were higher in Europe (OR = 2.20; 95%
CI = 1.62, 2.99) than in the United States
(OR = 1.67; 95% CI = 1.38, 2.03). Although
some typologies were associated with
cardiovascular risk factors and chronic diseases
within Europe and the United States, no
statistically significant differences were found
in the odds of any of the cardiovascular
risk factors and chronic diseases between
American and European women in all
work–family typologies.
US–Europe Differences in
Cardiovascular Health
Table 2 shows the observed probabilities
of each cardiovascular outcome, alongside
the counterfactual probabilities if US
women had experienced the same distri-
bution of and risks associated with work–
family typologies as European women.
American women would have had a mar-
ginal lower probability of chronic diseases
and risk factors except for obesity if they had
been exposed to the same distribution of
work–family typologies as European
women. For example, the original proba-
bility of stroke for US women was 4.4%
(95% CI = 3.9%, 4.9%); however, if US
women would experience the same work–
family typology distribution as European
women, their counterfactual probability
would be 4.1% (95% CI = 3.6%, 4.6%).
These decreases in the probabilities for US
women reflected the fact that European
women had slightly “healthier” work–
family typologies (e.g., working married
mothers) and fewer were working single
mothers than were American women. If
US women would have had the same
health risks associated with each work–
family typology as European women, the
probability for stroke and high blood pres-
sure would decrease, but the probability
for heart disease, smoking, and obesity
would increase.
When we combine all information, re-
sults show that American women would
have had a marginally lower probability of
stroke and high blood pressure if they had
been exposed to both the European distri-
bution as well as the European health risks
associated with each typology. The re-
duction in the probability of high blood
pressure would be around 2 percentage
points (from 53.3% to 51.4%), and the re-
duction in the probability of stroke would be
about 1 percentage point (from 4.4% to
3.5%). These findings suggest that differ-
ences in work–family typologies explained
only a small fraction of the higher prevalence
of cardiovascular disease of American relative
to European women.

 DISCUSSION
Overall, distributions of work–family
typologies and their associated cardiovascular
health risks were relatively similar between
the United States and Europe. American
women weremore likelyto have had a history
of working single motherhood than Euro-
pean women. Single working motherhood
was consistently associated with worse car-
diovascular health outcomes, but we found
no evidence that this association was stronger
for American than for European women. This
larger probability of stroke among Ameri-
can women, however, would only be mar-
ginally reduced if American women had
experienced similar work–family trajectories
and risks as European women. Our findings
suggest that work–family typologies con-
tributed little to the higher prevalence of
cardiovascular disease and risk factors of
American relative to European women.
Methodological Considerations
We pooled data to derive work–family
typologies to ensure that both American
and European women were clustered in the
same way. In sensitivity analysis, we con-
ducted sequence analyses for women in the
US and Europe separately (results available
upon request), but this revealed no sub-
stantial differences in typologies between the
United States and Europe. The only ex-
ception was for single working mothers,
whereby US women were often clustered
in a new typology of working married
mothers who became divorced or widowed.
Some of the differences in risk associated
with this typology may thus reflect the fact
that we were comparing 2 partly different
groups of women in the United States
and Europe.
Sequence analysis requires complete life
trajectories. We used partial imputations and
made some assumptions on the basis of the
retrospective data when information was
incomplete. For SHARE, we assumed no
gap between 2 spells of employment if in-
formation was incomplete.27 For HRS, we
inferred information on work and family life
from information on children’s birth dates,
wedding and divorce dates, and starting and
ending dates of jobs.23 If these inferences were
insufficient, we applied partial imputations
to minimize the amount of missing data; this
was true for about 3% of marriage histories,
about 24% of work histories, and 0% of pa-
rental histories. For HRS, we validated work
history imputations by using Social Security
data. These Social Security records were
available from 1951 onward. Women born in
1935 would have been aged 16 years in 1951,
which is the first age of our work–life tra-
jectory, and therefore we only included
women born in 1935 or later in our sample.

 This resulted in women aged 50 to 72 years
being selected for all samples.
When defining the work–family variables,
we decided to use dichotomized variables to
represent whether each woman was an em-
ployee, a wife, or a mother. It could be argued
that our analysis might have benefitted from
more detailed information on employment,
marital status, and child histories. In particular,
employed women might have been working
part-time or full-time, nonemployment may
have been a choice, women who were not
married might have been cohabitating or may
have had strong support from family or
friends, and mothers might have had 1 or
more children. However, this additional
information would also increase the number
of manageable work–family combinations,
potentially compromising comparability
across regions. For this analysis, we felt that
a dichotomous version of exposure variables
was appropriate to provide a sense of the
overall contribution of work–family typolo-
gies to health differences between American
and European women.
We used self-reported measures of car-
diovascular disease because no objective
measures of cardiovascular disease endpoints
were available in HRS and SHARE. How-
ever, Banks et al.1 have shown large consis-
tency between data from biomarkers and
self-reports with data from HRS (United
States) and the English Longitudinal Study of
Aging (England). In addition, Glymour and
Avendano28 found that incidence rates of
stroke based on self-reports in HRS compare
well to stroke incidence estimates from
clinically verified studies. Therefore, al-
though we acknowledge this limitation, we
believe self-reported data provide an overall
good estimate of the prevalence of broad
categories of cardiovascular disease in a pop-
ulation. Another possible limitation of our
measures is that both heart disease and stroke
comprise broad categories of cardiovascular
disease, so that we are unable to derive
conclusions on the prevalence of subtypes of
cardiovascular disease. In addition, differences

 in how the risk factors and chronic diseases
were measured in HRS and SHARE (Table
B) remain a potential source of bias. How-
ever, it is unclear whether this discrepancy
would change the general conclusion re-
garding the association between work–family
typologies and the cardiovascular outcomes,
particularly smoking.
Interpretation
Consistent with findings from previous
studies, we found that women who were
consistently working, married, and had
children were in general healthier than
women following a different work–family life
trajectory.23,29 This is consistent with the role
accumulation hypothesis, which suggests that
combining these roles is beneficial for
a woman’s health.13 As an alternative, how-
ever, this finding is likely to reflect at least
some selection: healthier women are more
likely to marry, have children, and work.
We also found that married mothers who
returned to paid employment after some years
of nonemployment had elevated odds of
stroke and that working single mothers were
worse off than working married mothers.
This suggests that combining work and par-
enthood while having little (spousal) support
may be detrimental for a woman’s cardio-
vascular health in the long run.30
Lone motherhood was more common in
the United States than in Europe and was
more strongly related to stroke among
American women. Lone mothers are at
higher risk of poverty and unemploy-
ment.31,32 Therefore, more generous family
policies in Europe may relieve poverty and
related stress, for example, by providing
maternity leave, offering the possibility to
work part-time, and providing better child
care and support.33 As a result, single working
mothers in the United States may have had
more often difficulties to make ends meet,
and they may have experienced more stressful
lives than European mothers under more
supportive policy regimes. Single non-
working mothers in the United States who
lacked (employment-related) health in-
surance may have experienced larger in-
equalities in health care access than European
mothers because health care is more uni-
versally accessible in Europe than the
United States.34
The prevalence of lone motherhood in-
creased in recent decades in both Europe
and the United States.35 Our findings,
therefore, highlight the need to develop
wider policies to support single mothers in
both regions. First, policies that target car-
diovascular disease prevention to single
working mothers may prove important to
obtain gains in population health. Second,
programs that support poor, working, single
mothers such as the Earned Income Tax
Credit or child allowances for working
parents may contribute to reducing their
health disadvantage.
Overall, we found only small differences in
the composition of and cardiovascular risks
associated with work–family typologies over
the lifetime of American and European
women. This suggests that the dominant
mechanisms linking work, marital, and ma-
ternal status (including financial security and
social support) to cardiovascular risk, and the
buffering role of social policies for women in
these typologies, are relatively similar and do
not result in different associations with car-
diovascular outcomes. Instead, other factors
may explain the higher prevalence of car-
diovascular disease among US women.
For example, smoking, obesity, and other
proximal risk factors have been put forward in
the literature as partial explanations for the
US female health disadvantage.2–6 Also, larger
educational disparities in mortality in the
United States than in Europe partly explain
why mortality in the United States is higher
than that in many European countries.26
Overall, we found that differences in work–
family typologies explained only a small
fraction of the excess risk of stroke and high
blood pressure of American women com-
pared with European women.
Conclusions and Implications
Working single motherhood was more
common in the United States than in Europe,
but differences in work–family trajectories
explained only a small fraction of the excess
cardiovascular risk of American relative to
European women. Policies and interventions
that support women combining work and
family roles may improve women’s cardio-
vascular health, but may only marginally
contribute to reducing the health disadvan-
tage of American compared with European
women. Further research should examine
whether other aspects of women’s life tra-
jectories may be more important in un-
derstanding the health disadvantage of US
relative to European women.
