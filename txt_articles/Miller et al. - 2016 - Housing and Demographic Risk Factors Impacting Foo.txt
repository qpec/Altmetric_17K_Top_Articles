Abstract
For more than three decades, foot and musculoskeletal conditions have been documented
among both Asian [Elephas maximus] and African [Loxodonta africana] elephants in zoos.
Although environmental factors have been hypothesized to play a contributing role in the
development of foot and musculoskeletal pathology, there is a paucity of evidence-based
research assessing risk. We investigated the associations between foot and musculoskele-
tal health conditions with demographic characteristics, space, flooring, exercise, enrich-
ment, and body condition for elephants housed in North American zoos during 2012.
Clinical examinations and medical records were used to assess health indicators and pro-
vide scores to quantitate conditions. Using multivariable regression models, associations
were found between foot health and age [P value = 0.076; Odds Ratio = 1.018], time spent
on hard substrates [P value = 0.022; Odds Ratio = 1.014], space experienced during the
night [P value = 0.041; Odds Ratio = 1.008], and percent of time spent in indoor/outdoor
exhibits during the day [P value < 0.001; Odds Ratio = 1.003]. Similarly, the main risk factors
for musculoskeletal disorders included time on hard substrate [P value = 0.002; Odds
Ratio = 1.050] and space experienced in indoor/outdoor exhibits [P value = 0.039; Odds
Ratio = 1.037]. These results suggest that facility and management changes that decrease
time spent on hard substrates will improve elephant welfare through better foot and muscu-
loskeletal health.

 Introduction
Foot and musculoskeletal []conditions are among the most commonly reported health issues
affecting African and Asian elephants under human care, and have been challenging veterinary
issues for zoo elephants for nearly a century [1, 2]. In 1994, Mikota et al. published an extensive
review of medical records from 69 North American zoos and concluded that over the course of
the 84 years for which documentation was available, an average of 50% of the elephants experi-
enced foot pathology and 64% experienced musculoskeletal abnormalities [other than those
affecting the feet] [3]. More recently, 33% of zoos surveyed reported at least one foot abnormal-
ity, 36% reported at least one case of arthritis, and 18% reported at least one case of lameness in
their elephant populations within the previous year [4].
Foot and musculoskeletal health conditions of concern in elephants are pododermatitis, toe-
nail cracks and overgrowth, onychia [inflammation/infection of the toenail bed], sole over-
growth and abscesses, osteomyelitis of the phalanges, degenerative joint disease, osteoarthritis,
trauma, and soft tissue strains, although this is not an inclusive list [5,6,7]. Elephant feet and
limbs may be predisposed to some of these conditions due to their unique anatomy and pres-
sures experienced due to large body mass [8]. Bones of the feet are oriented so that just the tips
of the phalanges come into contact with the substrate via the associated nails [8]. In addition a
cartilaginous rod extends caudally to support the large cushion in the heel which distributes
forces across the foot [9]. Studies have shown that increased foot pressures are associated with
larger body mass, and that elephants carry more than 60% of their weight in the forelimbs [10].
Limb bones in normal elephants have little angulation, and therefore, forces are transmitted in
line with the axis of the leg through the joints [3]. The long life of these species may lead to
repeated force to the structures of the foot and limbs, potentially leading to health concerns.
Since health is an important indicator of animal welfare [11], there is considerable interest
in developing a better understanding of the risk factors that contribute to poor foot and muscu-
loskeletal health so that targeted prevention and intervention strategies may be applied. Clini-
cal experiences suggest that lack of exercise, limited space, standing on hard substrates,
environmental factors that increase contact of feet with excrement, urine, and moisture, and
obesity are potential contributors to foot and musculoskeletal pathology [5,6,7]. However,
there is a paucity of literature that scientifically investigates the association of these factors with
foot and musculoskeletal disorders in elephants. The goals of this study were to 1) ascertain the
current status of foot and musculoskeletal health of elephants housed at zoos accredited by the
Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) in North America; 2) investigate the associations
of demographic, environmental, and management factors with foot and musculoskeletal prob-
lems; and 3) support evidence-based recommendations for interventions to prevent pathology
and improve the foot and musculoskeletal health of zoo elephants.

 within the 2012 study year. Data were sourced from medical records and physical exams for
each elephant completed by veterinarians at each participating zoo.
Musculoskeletal Assessment
Zoo-based veterinarians performed a visual/tactile examination of each individual elephant
using a checklist to record the presence or absence of abnormalities in the musculoskeletal sys-
tem of the limbs (shoulders, elbows, carpi, hips, stifles, tarsi) (S1 Template). Occurrences of
abnormalities such as swelling, heat, or angular deformities that reflected musculoskeletal
pathology were documented. Due to the elephant’s anatomy, visual and tactile examination is
less effective for detecting abnormalities in the more proximal joints, such as the shoulders and
hips. Therefore veterinarians also evaluated each animal for evidence of stiffness, lameness,
abnormal weight bearing, or mechanical limitations in the range of motion of the limb joints as
an additional indicator of musculoskeletal problems.
The project veterinarian reviewed all physical examination results and assigned each ele-
phant a musculoskeletal (MS) score based on the following system: a MS score of 0 indicated
no gait change, limb deformity, joint heat or swelling on the physical exam. A score of 1 indi-
cated one joint/limb had heat, swelling, or mild lameness/gait change; a score of 2 indicated
one joint/limb exhibited heat or swelling with associated lameness or stiffness; and a score of 3
indicated two or more joints or limbs with heat, swelling or joint deformity associated with
lameness or other gait deficiencies. The severity of abnormalities was not assessed since these
could not be reliably standardized between the different veterinarians performing the
examinations.
Foot Assessment
Zoo-based veterinarians evaluated each elephant’s external pedal tissue structures (foot pad,
interdigital space, cuticle, toenail) and recorded the presence or absence of abnormalities (but
not severity) on each foot (S1). Toenails were examined for any cracks, defects, or horn growth
abnormalities. In addition, veterinarians recorded any cracks, ulcerations, bruises, fissures,
abscesses, or horn growth/sole abnormalities on the foot pads and in the interdigital spaces.
Osteo-articular pathologies of the feet were not assessed during this portion of the examination
and results of radiographs were not included since the majority of elephants did not have con-
current imaging at the time of these evaluations.
Foot data from the physical examinations were reviewed by the project veterinarian and
each elephant was assigned a score based on the following system: each of three locations (toe-
nail, pad, or interdigital space) on a foot were assessed for the presence of an abnormality, and
each location on each foot with an abnormality was scored as 1, such that each foot could have
a maximum score of 3, with each elephant having a maximum score of 12.
In order to determine the subset of the elephant population that could potentially be
affected by chronic or recurrent foot problems, we requested the complete 2011 veterinary rec-
ords of each elephant included in the study. Where veterinary records were obtained and com-
plete for the calendar year, the project veterinarian assessed each record for notes where the
attending veterinarian had described problems or treatment pertaining to the elephant’s feet.
We were interested in evaluating chronic or recurrent (described as “possibly persistent” in the
remainder of the text) foot problems, however due to the level of detail provided in the 2011
records, we were not able to determine the severity of lesions nor whether the abnormalities
reported in the physical examination were the same exact location as those observed in 2011.
As such, the population of interest for further risk factor analyses included elephants with a
completed physical examination in 2012 who also had a record of one or more foot

 abnormalities in 2011. In this case, elephants with “possible persistent” foot problems had one
or more foot problems in both 2011 and 2012, but the exact nature and location of those prob-
lems could not be confirmed to be the same.
Independent Variables
We selected independent variables based on hypotheses regarding their potential association
with foot and MS scores. Definitions for the variables selected for testing in this study are
described in Table 1. Details on the collection and calculation of independent variables are pre-
sented in [12–16], but a few novel variables warrant further description.
We were interested in quantifying the amount of space available to each elephant. Because
many zoo elephants are shifted between different environments that comprise an exhibit for
varying amounts of time each day, a new variable was calculated to capture the experience of
the elephants as a factor of both the size of their different environments and the amount of
time they are housed in each space. This Space Experience variable [12] was calculated by first
taking the size [m^2] of each environment in which an elephant spent time and then multiply-
ing it by the percentage of time the elephant spent in that environment. These weighted

 environment sizes were then averaged to calculate a representative value for each elephant. The
Space Experience variables were adjusted to a value of “per 500 ft2” to aid in interpretation of
Beta values.
To calculate our environment type and flooring substrate variables, we first defined each
space in which elephants spent time as indoors, outdoors or mixed based on detailed facility
surveys [12]. Mixed environments were areas where elephants had a choice to move freely
between indoor and outdoor spaces. We then defined multiple classes of flooring substrate:
grass, sand, rubber padding, stone aggregate, concrete and categorized the types of substrates
into hard surface (concrete and stone aggregate), soft surface (grass, sand, and rubber padding)
and determined the percent coverage for each substrate type for each environment. We wanted
to calculate the time that elephants spent in contact with each substrate type so to confirm this
we determined which environments were comprised of 100% hard and 100% soft substrate
and calculated the percent time each elephant spent in environments that met this criteria
from detailed housing time budgets [12]
Statistical Analysis
The MS score, foot score, and co-localization frequencies were calculated. Co-localization was
defined as more than one type of abnormality per foot. Sex and species differences were
assessed using Chi-Square analysis. We calculated descriptive statistics for the mean percent
coverage of hard and soft flooring surfaces for each environment type (indoors, outdoors, and
mixed), and Chi-Square analysis was used to determine if there were any associations between
the environment type (indoors, outdoors, and mixed) and the frequency of 100% coverage of
hard or soft surfaces.
Predictive models for MS and foot scores were fitted using generalized estimating equations
(GEE), which allowed for repeated measurement and clustering of individual animals within
zoos. Multinomial logistic regression was used for MS scores, with a reference level of zero, or
“no joint problems”. For foot scores, the score mean equaled the variance, supporting the use
of log-linear Poisson regression models. Residual over-dispersion was accounted for by allow-
ing a multiplicative over-dispersion factor, specified as the deviance scale. Multivariable regres-
sion models were built by assessing individual predictors and manually conducting forward
stepwise selection based on quasi-likelihood under the independence model criterion (QIC)
values and parameter estimates of explanatory variables. Models exhibiting multi-collinearity,
as defined by a variance inflation factor (VIF) of greater than 10 and a Condition Index (CI) of
greater than 30, were not considered for further analysis. Age, sex, species, and origin were
assessed as potential confounders to the models. An independent correlation structure was
specified. Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS software, version 9.3 [PROC GEN-
MOD, with options REPEATED, CORR = IND, DIST = [MULT or POISSON], LINK = [CLO-
GIT or LOG]; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC], and a P value of < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results
Musculoskeletal Health
Within the study population of 255 elephants, 198 had complete musculoskeletal health data.
The majority of elephants, 74.7% (148 / 198), did not have any reported musculoskeletal abnor-
malities. Table 2 shows the frequency of MS scores within the study population. There were no
significant statistical differences between the MS scores based on sex (P value = 0.070) or spe-
cies (P value = 0.488).

 The results of univariate modeling of space and substrate variables on MS scores are pre-
sented in Table 3, and were used to guide development of the multivariable model. Descriptive
statistics detailing the variables included in the multi-variable regression model are shown in
Table 4. In the multivariable multinomial logistic predictive model, the combination of time on
hard substrate, Space Experience in environments that included both indoor and outdoor
areas, and the interaction of Space Experience In/Out Choice with age had the most effect on
odds of increased MS scores (Table 5). The odds ratio for percent time spent on hard surfaces
was 1.050. An example of how this odds ratio associates time on hard substrates with MS scores
is illustrated using population-level descriptive statistics for time on hard substrates. Elephants
that spend 4 hours per 24 hour period on hard substrates (population 3rd quartile) are 68%
more likely to have a MS score of 2 (versus 1) than are elephants which spend 2.5 hours per 24
hour period on hard substrates (population mean). Space Experience for areas with a choice of
indoors or outdoors is associated with a 3.7% increase in odds of a higher MS score. However,
this effect is attenuated by age, such that for each year an elephant ages, the effect of Space
Experience In/Out Choice on MS score decreases by 0.1%.
Foot Health
Within the study population of 255 elephants, 215 had physical examinations completed for
foot health. Of these, 32.6% (70 / 215) had no noted foot abnormalities at the time of examina-
tion, and for those that did, 88.3% (128 / 145) had foot scores of between 1 and 4 (maximum
score of 12). Table 6 details the frequency of foot scores within the population. There was no
difference in foot scores by species (P value > 0.05).
Of the 145 animals with recorded abnormalities, 92.4% (134 / 145) elephants had abnormali-
ties of the nails, 13.1% (19 / 145) had abnormalities on their pads, and 22.8% (33 / 145) had
abnormalities in their interdigital space. Fig 1 shows the distribution of feet per elephant where
abnormalities were present. Co-localization, the occurrence of abnormalities in combination (two
or three locations per foot), was present in 13.0% (28 / 215) of the population, as seen in Fig 2.
One hundred sixty-three elephants had complete 2011 veterinary records and a physical
exam conducted in 2012. Sixty-four of those 163 elephants had at least one foot abnormality in
their 2011 records, and therefore met the criteria for the analysis of possible persistent foot
(PPF) abnormalities. Table 6 lists the foot score frequencies for the full population (2012), and
for those with PPF scores (2012 score if abnormality listed in 2011). Of those elephants meeting
the criteria for PPF scores, 79.7% (51 / 64) had at least one foot abnormality reported in the
2012 physical exam, suggesting potential chronicity or recurrence. The majority of these ele-
phants had abnormalities of the toenails (73.4%; 47 / 64), while 10.9% (7 / 64) had abnormali-
ties on pads and 20.3% (13 / 64) had abnormalities in the interdigital space. There were no

 significant statistical differences between the PPF scores based on sex (P value = 0.820) or spe-
cies (P value = 0.527).
Since chronic or recurrent foot issues have been postulated to be related to husbandry/man-
agement conditions, univariate modeling of the foot scores from the 64 elephants in the PPF
sub-population was performed and results presented in Table 7. These findings were used to
guide development of the multivariable model. Descriptive statistics detailing the variables
retained in the final multi-variable model are shown in Table 8. The multivariable Poisson pre-
dictive model found that the combination of time on hard substrate, percent of time spent during
the day with a choice of indoors or outdoors, and Space Experience at night (11) had the greatest
effect on risk of possible persistent foot scores (Table 9). The risk ratio for percent time spent on
hard surfaces was 1.014 (Fig 3). An example of how this risk ratio associates time on hard sub-
strates with foot scores is illustrated using the population-level descriptive statistics for time on
hard substrates. Elephants that spend 3 hours per 24 hour period on hard substrate (population
mean) are 18% more likely to have a foot score of 6, while those spending 5 hours per 24 hour
period (population 3rd quartile) are 32% more likely to have a foot score of 7. We found a smaller

 effect on foot score when elephants spent time in environments where there was a choice of
being indoors or outdoors during the day; there was a 0.8% increase in risk of increased foot
score for each incremental increase in percent time increase in these mixed indoor/outdoor envi-
ronments. In addition, Space Experience at night is associated with a 0.3% increase in risk in foot
score. Age is included in the model as a confounder of nighttime Space Experience.
Flooring and Environment Associations
We further analyzed the flooring substrate coverage data to better understand the potential
associations between environment types (indoors, outdoors and mixed) with flooring surfaces.
Table 10 shows the descriptive statistics for average percent coverage of hard flooring sur-
faces (concrete and stone aggregate) and soft flooring surfaces (grass, sand, and rubber pad-
ding) in different environment types (indoor, mixed, and outdoor). This analysis demonstrates
that the average coverage of hard and soft surfaces did not differ between indoor, outdoor and
mixed environments. While many environments had multiple substrate types, our modeling

details the cross-tabulation of unique environments included in the study between flooring
substrate (100% hard surface and 100% soft surface) with environment type (indoor, mixed,
and outdoor). No statistical association of environment type by 100% substrate coverage was
found (X2 (2, N = 443) = 3.36, P value = 0.186).
Discussion
A number of factors such as age, housing conditions and management practices have been sug-
gested as risk factors for foot and musculoskeletal pathologies in elephants under managed
care, but to date no studies have tested these associations with robust sample sizes and clinical
assessments collected by veterinarians on individual elephants. For example, Fowler [5] pro-
poses that lack of exercise, limited space, standing on hard substrates, environmental factors
that increase contact of feet with excrement, and moisture, and obesity are important contrib-
uting factors to elephant foot and musculoskeletal health problems (based on clinical observa-
tions], while Lewis et al. [4] used regression modeling to demonstrate that age predicted
likelihood of arthritis (based on surveys without accompanying clinical assessments]. In this
study, clinical assessments of musculoskeletal and pedal external tissue conditions were paired
with individual elephant data describing demographic, housing, flooring, exercise, enrichment,
body condition and other variables to determine associations and to provide potential insights
into facility and management changes that could improve health and welfare.

 When musculoskeletal health was evaluated via physical examination, the majority (74.5%;
148 / 198) of elephants had no observable movement or clinical abnormalities (i.e., swelling,
heat, or deformity] of their limbs. Twenty-two animals (11.1%; 22 / 198) had problems with
stiffness, gait, or limitations in movement in addition to one or more detectable musculoskele-
tal abnormalities (swelling, heat or deformity], suggesting more significant pathology. However
it is important to note that visual and tactile examination is limited as a technique for detecting
musculoskeletal abnormalities compared to the clinical use of radiography or thermography.
As such, the prevalence of joint abnormalities found in this study may be underestimated due
to the fact that we did not employ more sensitive diagnostic techniques.
Although there were no statistical differences between frequencies of musculoskeletal abnor-
malities in African and Asian elephants in this study, the only two elephants with multiple mus-
culoskeletal abnormalities were Asian. This finding differs from previous studies in which
musculoskeletal abnormalities were statistically more frequently in Asian elephants [3, 17]. Fur-
ther, in the Lewis et al. study [4], most of the variance attributed to species differences was
explained by the fact that the Asian elephants significantly older than the African elephants,
however we did not find a similar positive association between age and MS scores in our study.
With respect to foot abnormalities, we found that approximately two-thirds of elephants in
the current study had recorded nail, pad, or interdigital space abnormalities. Toenail problems,
specifically onychitis (inflammation/infection of the nail bed] have been previously reported as
the most common zoo elephant foot pathology [3]. In our population, toenail abnormalities
including cracks, defects, inflammation, and horn growth abnormalities comprised 72.7% of all
reported foot issues. These findings support those of a recent study in which the highest pressure
measured in elephant feet occurred at the distal ends of the lateral toes which make contact
through the toenails, suggesting a biomechanical link to foot pathologies (8). In addition, as ele-
phants grow larger and older, their gait changes so that more pressure is initially placed on the
cranial aspect of the foot. Over time, these repeated concussive forces may lead to development
of abnormalities. Our data suggest that increased age did have an effect on risk of persistent foot
abnormalities. Conformation, individual weight-bearing patterns, or musculoskeletal issues (i.e.,
arthritis] may also predispose to pedal aberrations [5, 7]. To support this premise, 13% of ele-
phants in our study had concurrent abnormalities of several areas on a single foot, which

 suggests more extensive pathology. Twelve of the 28 elephants with multiple foot abnormalities
had only one foot affected while 7 elephants had two feet affected and 5 individuals displayed
multiple abnormalities on all 4 feet. Coexisting abnormalities on multiple feet suggest the inclu-
sion of other influencing factors, such as environmental conditions, management practices
(including participation of elephant for routine foot care), or changes in overall health status
[7]. Thus, our data suggest that despite improvements in preventive foot care in AZA facilities
[4], foot pathology remains a health concern for elephants housed in North American zoos.
In order to determine persistence of foot abnormalities in our study population, historical
medical records (calendar year 2011] from 163 elephants were matched with findings of the
2012 physical exam. Of the 64 animals with recorded foot issues during 2011, the majority
(79.7%; 51 / 64] had one or more recorded abnormalities on examination in 2012, suggesting
chronic or recurring pedal pathology.
Our results demonstrate that one of the main housing risk factors for increased foot and
musculoskeletal abnormalities was time spent on hard surfaces. Studies in cattle have shown
that hard surfaces in alleys and walk-ways contribute to an increased incidence of claw lesions
and lameness [18, 19], whereas cattle that have access to pasture (natural substrate] have lower
levels of foot abnormalities [20]. In zoo settings, the prevalence of chronic foot disease in greater
one-horned rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis) was found to be 22.2%, and the authors specu-
lated that trauma from concrete and lack of access to ponds and wallows were contributing fac-
tors [21]. Clinical case studies with elephants show that standing or walking on hard substrates
such as concrete or stone can lead to trauma of foot pads, toenails, joints, and other musculo-
skeletal structures resulting in cracks, abscesses, bruises, strains, and degenerative joint disease
[5, 7, 17]. Indeed, the final multi-variable models revealed a significant relationship between
time on hard substrate and both foot and MS scores such that just a 10% increase in time on
hard surfaces was associated with increased risk of both foot and musculoskeletal abnormalities.
Since our objective was to measure the amount of time the elephants spent in contact with dif-
ferent substrate types, we therefore focused the analysis on substrate categories where we knew
the environment consisted of 100% coverage of hard substrate or 100% coverage of soft sub-
strate. This is a conservative approach, as time spent in environments with substrate coverage
that was large, but less than 100%, was not captured in this analysis [12]. Despite these limita-
tions, our methods for estimating exposure to hard and soft surfaces proved sufficient for detect-
ing associations with both foot and musculoskeletal problems. Our findings support the
supposition that there is a link between foot pathology and regional peak pressures in the ele-
phant’s foot [8]. Since foot pressure would be expected to increase with firmer surfaces, this may
explain the observations that associate foot problems and hard substrate [5, 7].
Both foot and musculoskeletal scores were also associated with variables that described ele-
phants’ access to exhibit spaces made up of both indoor and outdoor areas. For foot health, the
variable included in the final model described the percent time the elephants spent in mixed
indoor/outdoor spaces and the MS scores model included Space Experience In/Out Choice,
which is a measure of the size of the mixed indoor/outdoor spaces weighted by the amount of
time the elephant spent in those spaces [12]. Although we hypothesized that mixed exhibits
would encourage more walking, which would promote better foot (through normal wear] and
musculoskeletal health (through exercise] and thereby be associated with decreased scores, the
opposite relationship between time spent in mixed exhibits and both foot and MS scores was
found. For example, an incremental increase of 10% time in mixed exhibit space increased the
risk of foot abnormalities by 8.3%, and there was a 3.7% incremental increase in risk for muscu-
loskeletal abnormalities in elephants that experienced increased indoor/outdoor exhibit Space
Experience, although this was attenuated with age. One possible explanation for these finding
could be that when elephants spend more time in mixed exhibits, they are more likely to be on

 hard surfaces. However, our assessment of substrate type by environment type indicated that
mixed indoor/outdoor environments are not more likely to have 100% coverage of hard sub-
strate, and we found that mixed environments had the same average percent coverage of hard
and soft substrates as indoor or outdoor environments. Since our assessment of flooring did
not capture time spent in environments with less than 100% substrate coverage, we cannot
completely rule out substrate exposure as the underlying reason for the effects that mixed
indoor/outdoor environments had in our models, but our investigation of the potential associa-
tions between substrate and environment type indicates that there is likely another explanation
for these correlations. For example, it is possible that when elephants have the opportunity to
move between indoor and outdoor areas, they are exposed to fluctuations in temperature or
humidity that could impact musculoskeletal or pedal health, or that, movement between differ-
ent types of spaces could be associated with more frequent contact with environmental features
(gates, thresholds) that could lead to trauma to pedal and other limb structures. Given that
time spent in mixed indoor/outdoor exhibits is associated with a decreased risk of performing
stereotypic behavior [22], further investigation into underlying contributors to the association
between mixed environments and foot/musculoskeletal health is warranted.
We also investigated the association between space and foot and MS scores with the hypoth-
esis that increased space would improve foot and MS scores via increased locomotion. How-
ever, this supposition was not supported in the multi-variable analyses. In fact, an incremental
increase in 500 square feet of space available at night led to a 0.3% increased risk of higher foot
scores. We are unclear as to why this relationship was found in the model, but further research
including observational studies of elephants at night could potentially reveal behavioral differ-
ences associated with larger spaces that could help explain this result. Age was a significant risk
factor for foot problems. For example, a ten year increase in age led to a 19.5% increase in prob-
ability of foot abnormalities. Degenerative processes of the musculoskeletal system have been
found to be age-related in a variety of species. For example, age has been previously identified
as a contributor to increases in the likelihood of foot pathology and diagnosis of arthritis in zoo
elephants [7]. In dairy cattle, age-related increases in locomotive abnormalities have been
reported [23], and age was also strongly associated with risk of cranial cruciate ligament rup-
ture in dogs that have had a previous episode [24].
Significant morbidity can result from chronic pododermatitis and degenerative joint disease
in elephants [2,25–26]. Foot abscesses may progress to pedal osteomyelitis, which requires
intensive management and may lead to euthanasia in unresolved cases [7]. Chronic joint
pathology may lead to limited range-of-motion and lameness, which reflects declining welfare
for the individual [2]. One of the logistical constraints in this study was the inability to evaluate
the severity of individual foot and musculoskeletal abnormalities. Since physical exams and
medical record entries were performed by the attending veterinarian at each facility rather than
a consistent set of observers for all facilities, measures of foot and musculoskeletal health were
limited to the presence or absence of abnormalities rather than a quantitative evaluation of
severity. Future studies of this nature may endeavor to include assessments of severity to fur-
ther develop our understanding of foot and musculoskeletal conditions in zoo elephants.
The conclusion that more time spent on hard surfaces is associated with increased trauma
to pedal and musculoskeletal structures resulting in pathology is supported by cases in the liter-
ature as well as the results of our multivariable analyses [1, 2, 3, 8, 25]. Space Experience at
night and in mixed exhibits also appear to be factors that need further investigation. The iden-
tified associations between risk of developing foot and musculoskeletal health issues and envi-
ronmental conditions in elephants in North American zoos provide focused areas for
recommendations and further research. The results indicate that foot and musculoskeletal
health continue to be a concern for elephants housed in North American zoos. Prevention is

 fundamental through identifying and minimizing risk factors that contribute to these health
conditions. The evidence indicates that facility and management changes which decrease time
spent on hard substrates are likely to lead to improvements in foot and musculoskeletal health
and overall welfare.
