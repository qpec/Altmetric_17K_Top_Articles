IMPORTANCE Acute respiratory tract infections account for the majority of antibiotic
exposure in children, and broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory tract
infections is increasing. It is not clear whether broad-spectrum treatment is associated with
improved outcomes compared with narrow-spectrum treatment.
OBJECTIVE To compare the effectiveness of broad-spectrum and narrow-spectrum antibiotic
treatment for acute respiratory tract infections in children.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective cohort study assessing clinical
outcomes and a prospective cohort study assessing patient-centered outcomes of children
between the ages of 6 months and 12 years diagnosed with an acute respiratory tract
infection and prescribed an oral antibiotic between January 2015 and April 2016 in a network
of 31 pediatric primary care practices in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Stratified and
propensity score–matched analyses to account for confounding by clinician and by
patient-level characteristics, respectively, were implemented for both cohorts.
EXPOSURES Broad-spectrum antibiotics vs narrow-spectrum antibiotics.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES In the retrospective cohort, the primary outcomes were
treatment failure and adverse events 14 days after diagnosis. In the prospective cohort, the
primary outcomes were quality of life, other patient-centered outcomes, and
patient-reported adverse events.
RESULTS Of 30 159 children in the retrospective cohort (19 179 with acute otitis media; 6746,
group A streptococcal pharyngitis; and 4234, acute sinusitis), 4307 (14%) were prescribed
broad-spectrum antibiotics including amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalosporins, and macrolides.
Broad-spectrum treatment was not associated with a lower rate of treatment failure (3.4% for
broad-spectrum antibiotics vs 3.1% for narrow-spectrum antibiotics; risk difference for full
matched analysis, 0.3% [95% CI, −0.4% to 0.9%]). Of 2472 children enrolled in the prospective
cohort (1100 with acute otitis media; 705, group A streptococcal pharyngitis; and 667, acute
sinusitis), 868 (35%) were prescribed broad-spectrum antibiotics. Broad-spectrum antibiotics
were associated with a slightly worse child quality of life (score of 90.2 for broad-spectrum
antibiotics vs 91.5 for narrow-spectrum antibiotics; score difference for full matched analysis,
−1.4% [95% CI, −2.4% to −0.4%]) but not with other patient-centered outcomes.
Broad-spectrum treatment was associated with a higher risk of adverse events documented by
the clinician (3.7% for broad-spectrum antibiotics vs 2.7% for narrow-spectrum antibiotics; risk
difference for full matched analysis, 1.1% [95% CI, 0.4% to 1.8%]) and reported by the patient
(35.6% for broad-spectrum antibiotics vs 25.1% for narrow-spectrum antibiotics; risk difference
for full matched analysis, 12.2% [95% CI, 7.3% to 17.2%]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among children with acute respiratory tract infections,
broad-spectrum antibiotics were not associated with better clinical or patient-centered
outcomes compared with narrow-spectrum antibiotics, and were associated with higher
rates of adverse events. These data support the use of narrow-spectrum antibiotics for most
children with acute respiratory tract infections.

ntibiotics are the most common medications pre-
scribed for children.1 The majority of antibiotic use
occurs for the treatment of acute respiratory tract
infections.2 Acute otitis media, acute sinusitis, and group A
streptococcal pharyngitis account for almost all bacterial acute
respiratory tract infections. Broad-spectrum antibiotic pre-
scribing for these conditions now accounts for approximately
half of all antibiotic prescribing for children.2-6 Overuse of
broad-spectrum antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistance,
drug-related adverse events,7 and increased costs.
Current guidance on antibiotic choice for acute respira-
tory tract infections is inconsistent. The American Academy
of Pediatrics recommends penicillin or amoxicillin, which
are both narrow-spectrum antibiotics, as first-line therapy
for most children with acute otitis media8; however, clini-
cal trials have used amoxicillin-clavulanate, which is a
broad-spectrum antibiotic, to compare with placebo for
acute otitis media, suggesting that broad-spectrum antibiot-
ics are appropriate.9,10 Likewise, recent guidelines from the
American Academy of Pediatrics include amoxicillin as a
first-line treatment of acute sinusitis,8 but the practice
guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America
recommend amoxicillin-clavulanate.11 For group A strepto-
coccal pharyngitis, narrow-spectrum antibiotics have his-
torically been recommended; however, suggestions have
arisen that cephalosporins provide added benefit.12 These
recommendations toward broad-spectrum antibiotics are
influenced by the predicted effects of the changing microbi-
ology associated with pneumococcal vaccination, which
may have shifted the balance away from pneumococcus
toward more β-lactamase–producing organisms.13 The clini-
cal consequences of this shift in microbiology on patient
outcomes, however, remain unclear.
Studies typically assess traditional clinical outcomes such
as treatment failure but ignore patient and caregiver perspec-
tives.Patient-centeredness14,15isparticularlyrelevantforacute
respiratory tract infections, which affect the lives of children
and their families in ways that might never come to medical
attention. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the effec-
tiveness of broad-spectrum and narrow-spectrum antibiotic
treatment for acute respiratory tract infections among chil-
dren by assessing both clinical outcomes and patient-
centered outcomes.
Methods
Study Design and Population
We conducted 2 cohort studies. The retrospective cohort
study assessed clinical outcomes. The prospective co-
hort study assessed patient-centered outcomes. Both studies
used a network of 31 pediatric primary care practices with
a common electronic health record, serving children from
diverse communities across southeastern Pennsylvania
(4 in Philadelphia, 3 of which were academic teaching prac-
tices) and southern New Jersey.16 Infants and children aged
6 months to 12 years were required to have a diagnosis of
acute respiratory tract infection (International Classification
of Diseases, Ninth Revision, and International Statistical Clas-
sification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth
Revision, diagnosis codes appear eTable 1 in the Supplement)
and a prescription for an oral antibiotic. For group A strepto-
coccal pharyngitis, a positive rapid streptococcal test also
was required. The institutional review board at the Chil-
dren’
s Hospital of Philadelphia approved this study.
Prospective Cohort Study of Patient-Centered Outcomes
Between January 2015 and April 2016, children meeting the
inclusion criteria were identified from the electronic health
record twice weekly and a sample stratified by acute respira-
tory tract infection diagnosis, antibiotic spectrum, and prac-
tice type (academic teaching practice vs other) was randomly
selected. Legal guardians were contacted by telephone 5
to 10 days after diagnosis to confirm eligibility (diagnosis,
antibiotic prescribed, and no antibiotic use during the
30 days prior to diagnosis) and that the child started antibi-
otic therapy. Legal guardians provided verbal informed con-
sent for participation in 2 telephone interviews and to allow
use of electronic health record data. Structured interviews
occurred 5 to 10 days and 14 to 20 days after diagnosis. At the
time of the data analysis, children younger than 3 years di-
agnosed with group A streptococcal pharyngitis were
excluded to reflect the guidelines from the American Acad-
emy of Pediatrics.17
Retrospective Cohort Study of Clinical Outcomes
The retrospective cohort was developed by using electronic
health record data only, was conducted after the prospective
cohort study was completed, and only included children who
had acute respiratory tract infections that occurred during
2015. Children were excluded if (1) their legal guardian did
not allow use of electronic health record data during the con-
sent process for the prospective cohort, (2) they were diag-
nosed with multiple bacterial infections, (3) they were pre-
scribed inappropriate therapy (choice or duration), (4) they
were treated with antibiotics or diagnosed with an acute
respiratory tract infection during the previous 30 days,
(5) they were previously diagnosed with a complex chronic
Key Points
Question Does treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics result in
better clinical or patient-centered outcomes than narrow-spectrum
antibiotics for children with acute respiratory tract infections?
Findings In a retrospective cohort of 30 159 children with acute
otitis media, group A streptococcal pharyngitis, and acute sinusitis,
treatment with broad-spectrum vs narrow-spectrum antibiotics
was not associated with treatment failure but was associated with
higher rates of adverse events (3.7% vs 2.7%, respectively). In a
prospective cohort of 2472 children, receipt of broad-spectrum
vs narrow-spectrum antibiotics was associated with a slightly
worse child quality of life and higher rates of adverse events
(35.6% vs 25.1%, respectively).
Meaning Use of broad-spectrum vs narrow-spectrum antibiotics
was not associated with better clinical or patient-centered
outcomes in children with acute respiratory tract infections.

 condition,18 or (6) they were younger than 3 years and diag-
nosed with group A streptococcal pharyngitis. The following
data were extracted from the electronic health record: health
care encounters, telephone calls, and prescriptions from the
index visit and the following 30 days. One of 2 registered
nurses with more than 10 years of experience in hospital epi-
demiology reviewed progress notes of select (described
below) outpatient and emergency department encounters.
A pediatric infectious diseases physician (J.S.G.) reviewed
medical records from all hospitalizations.
Exposure
Children who were prescribed broad-spectrum antibiotics
(full list of antibiotics appears in eTable 2 in the Supplement)
at diagnosis, including amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalo-
sporins, and macrolides, were defined as exposed. Children
who were prescribed the narrow-spectrum antibiotics penicil-
lin and amoxicillin were defined as unexposed. The term broad
spectrum referred to antibiotics with activity against clinically
important colonizing flora beyond pneumococcus (the pri-
mary target for the specified acute respiratory tract infections)
including Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and
Staphylococcusaureus.Althoughnotrecommendedforthetreat-
ment of acute otitis media and acute sinusitis, macrolides were
included as broad-spectrum antibiotics because of the fre-
quency of reported use for these conditions in this health care
network as well as nationally.2,19,20
Clinical Outcomes
Treatment failure and adverse events were assessed through
14 days (primary outcome) and 30 days after diagnosis.
Assessment of treatment failure started 2 days after diagno-
sis because antibiotic therapy for fewer than 2 days was likely
an insufficient amount of time to truly assess the effective-
ness of the initial antibiotic.10,17,21
Treatment failure was defined as a child having the same
acute respiratory tract infection diagnosis and a new prescrip-
tion for a systemic antibiotic reported during an in-person or
telephone encounter. If the encounter occurred during the ef-
fective duration of the initially prescribed (index) antibiotic
course (ie, the prescribed duration or twice the prescribed du-
ration for azithromycin to account for its pharmacokinetics),
progress notes were reviewed to distinguish between treat-
ment failure (persistence of symptoms or concern for failure
oftheindexantibiotic)andrequirementofanewantibioticdue
to an adverse event. Encounters with the same acute respira-
tory tract infection diagnosis and an antibiotic that occurred
after the effective duration of the index antibiotic were con-
sidered treatment failures (ie, recurrence) and did not re-
quire confirmatory record reviews.
Adverse events included diarrhea, candidiasis, noncan-
didal rash, other or unspecified allergic reaction, other or un-
specified adverse event, and vomiting identified from (1) prog-
ress notes (described above), (2) electronic health record
diagnosis codes, or (3) new antibiotic allergy noted in the elec-
tronic health record. Noncandidal rash, other or unspecified
allergic reaction, other or unspecified adverse event, and vom-
iting were assessed during the effective duration of the index
antibiotic. Candidiasis was assessed through 1 week after the
completionoftheindexcourse.Diarrheawasassessedthrough
30 days.
Patient-Centered Outcomes
Qualitative interviews were conducted with 109 legal guard-
ians and 24 children presenting with acute respiratory tract
infection symptoms at 4 practices.22,23 Respondents identi-
fied child suffering, missed school and work, child sleep
quality, adverse events, and speed of symptom resolution as
important outcomes related to treatment. Based on these
findings, the following patient-centered outcomes were
adopted: child quality of life, disrupted sleep, child missed
school, parent missed work, adverse events, and speed
of symptom resolution. The measurement model for the
Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL)24 (parent-proxy
report generic core scales25-27 and parent report infant
scales28) was selected to measure health-related quality of
life. The score can range from 0 to 100. Higher scores indi-
cate better health-related quality of life and a 4-point differ-
ence has been estimated to be clinically meaningful.25
The PedsQL included questions to assess sleep distur-
bance. An interview guide was developed to assess missed
school or day care, missed commitments or need for addi-
tional childcare by the parent, adverse events, and persistent
symptoms 72 hours after the initial diagnosis. The interview
guide was reviewed by members of the Children’
s Hospital of
Philadelphia family advisory board for clarity and face valid-
ity. The eText in the Supplement provides a detailed descrip-
tion of the patient-centered outcomes. Each patient-centered
outcome was assessed at the first interview between days 5
and 10. Patient-reported adverse events were assessed at the
second interview between days 14 and 20.
Covariates
For both cohorts, the covariates obtained from the electronic
health record included age, sex, race/ethnicity (which is
routinely documented at the first office visit), public in-
surance, season, prescription of antibiotic ear drops, practice
type (academic teaching vs other), type of clinician train-
ing (physician vs nurse practitioner), and years of phys-
ician experience (<10 vs ≥10). For the prospective cohort of
patient-centered outcomes, additional covariates obtained
during the first interview included symptoms at diagnosis,
school or day care attendance, and antibiotics prescribed
after initial treatment. Race/ethnicity also was obtained dur-
ing the second interview. The following prespecified catego-
ries were provided: American Indian or Alaskan Native,
Asian, black or African American, Native Hawaiian or other
Pacific Islander, white, or other. Prior work has shown an
association between antibiotic choice and race29 and race
may be associated with outcomes and documentation or
reporting of outcomes.
Analysis
Two complementary analyses were implemented for each
cohort: a stratified analysis by clinician and a propensity
score–based full matched analysis.30-32 Previous research in

 this health care network showed that antibiotic choice varied
by clinician and that the variability could not be fully
explained by differences in patient characteristics.19 Further-
more, outcomes likely vary by clinician through a variety of
mechanisms such as the clinician’
s communication skills,
office setting, and electronic health record documentation.
In addition, choice of antibiotic spectrum (broad vs narrow)
may be a product of patient characteristics. Variability in anti-
biotic prescribing by race, even within clinician, was previ-
ously documented in this population.29 Outcomes also may
be associated with these same patient characteristics. Thus,
although clinician and patient characteristics were identified
a priori as potentially important confounders, it was not fea-
sible to address both in a single analysis.
Stratification by clinician primarily addressed potential
confounding by clinician using an approach comparing the
exposure across children who were treated by the same cli-
nician. However, due to the large number of clinicians, the
sample size within each clinician stratum precluded simul-
taneous adjustment for patient-level characteristics. Even
though this stratified analysis may indirectly account for
patient-level characteristics given the relative homogeneity
of children seen by a clinician, it does not fully address con-
founding by patient-level characteristics.
Alternatively, in the full matched analysis, children
were matched using propensity scores to minimize differ-
ences between antibiotic spectrum group in patient-level
characteristics. This analysis primarily addresses confound-
ing by patient characteristics but does not directly address
confounding by clinician because matching stratified by
clinician requires large samples of children per clinician.
To offset the potential for residual confounding by clinician
in this analysis, basic clinician-level characteristics (practice
type, clinician type, and years of experience) were included
in the propensity score models.
Implementing 2 analyses assessed the robustness of the
effect estimates to several sources of confounding. Both
analyses were stratified by diagnosis to compare the associa-
tions of antibiotics across children within each diagnosis. In
the adjusted analysis, children missing race/ethnicity data
were excluded.
Stratified Analysis by Clinician
For the PedsQL, the only continuous outcome, fixed-effects
linear regression (first differencing method)33,34 was used with
strata (diagnosis and clinician) as fixed effects to obtain the
health-related quality-of-life score difference between anti-
biotic spectrum exposure groups. The response model in-
cluded indicators for the PedsQL questionnaire age groups to
account for differences in calibration across questionnaires.
For all other outcomes (binary), fixed-effects linear regres-
sion was used to estimate risk differences33 and conditional
logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios. Robust
variance methods were implemented throughout.
Propensity Score–Based Full Matched Analysis
The full matched analysis had 2 steps. In the first step, the pro-
pensity score models were estimated and stratified by diag-
nosis using logistic regression with antibiotic spectrum as the
dependent variable and patient and clinician characteristics
included as independent variables (eText in the Supple-
ment). Children prescribed narrow-spectrum antibiotics were
optimally matched to children prescribed broad-spectrum an-
tibioticsbasedonthepropensityscore(RpackageOptmatch35).
The advantage of a full matched analysis is that it minimizes
overall distance (ie, differences) across children by creating
matched sets of different sizes and includes all children. The
ratio of exposed to unexposed children was restricted within
matched sets to prevent large weights.30 Weights within each
set were calculated so that the sum of the weights in each ex-
posure group equaled the total number of children in the set
for estimation of the average treatment effect.32 After the
groups were matched, weighted means were calculated for
each covariate by exposure category to check for any remain-
ing imbalance of covariates. In the retrospective cohort,
the acute otitis media stratum was too large to implement
matching without subsetting, so these data were stratified
by sex and public insurance. Because practice type remained
imbalanced after matching for group A streptococcal pharyn-
gitis in the retrospective cohort, matching was repeated strati-
fied by practice type. For some patient-centered outcomes
(described in results), remaining imbalances were observed
by race, insurance, and practice type. Based on the geogra-
phy of the practice types, the remaining imbalances by race
and insurance were likely driven by practice-type imbalance;
therefore, practice type, diagnosis, and an interaction term
wereincludedinresponsemodelsforthepatient-centeredout-
comes for the full matched analysis.
In the second step, weighted response models were fit.
For the PedsQL used in the prospective cohort, the score dif-
ference was obtained from linear regression, which included
the questionnaire age categories. For binary outcomes, logis-
tic regression estimated the odds ratios and marginal stan-
dardization transformed the results to risk differences. The
parametric-basedvariancesaccountedformatching.36Therisk
difference variances were computed using the δ method.37
Sensitivity Analyses
In the prospective cohort, the degree of confounding from an
omitted covariate38 necessary to shift the PedsQL result so that
broad-spectrum antibiotics would be superior by 4.0 points
(clinically superior) was assessed. For clinical outcomes as-
sessed in the retrospective cohort, a similar sensitivity analy-
sis based on the e value considered hypothetical confounders
that could hide a broad-spectrum risk reduction of 1 percent-
age point.39 A second analysis for patient-reported adverse
events used inverse-probability weighting to account for
missing responses in the prospective cohort (eText in the
Supplement). Two post hoc analyses also were conducted in
the prospective cohort for the PedsQL outcome.
Ina3-levelhierarchicalanalysis,amixed-effectsmodelwas

tercept for clinician, and random intercept and slope for prac-

 fit to assess the potential for a ceiling effect, especially among
children without symptoms at baseline.
The statistical analyses were performed using Stata ver-
sion 14.2 (StataCorp) and R version 3.1.1 (R Foundation for
Statistical Computing). The 95% CIs were calculated to deter-
mine whether broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment was
superior to narrow-spectrum antibiotic treatment. Statistical
tests were 2-sided and the significance threshold was P < .05.
Although there was a large number of end points, all com-
parisons were prespecified except for the results stratified
by diagnosis and post hoc analyses. Because there was
no adjustment for significance to address potential type I
error, conventional levels of statistical significance may not
be applicable.
Results
Clinical Outcomes
After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 30 159
children comprised the retrospective cohort (19 179 with
acute otitis media, 6746 with group A streptococcal pharyn-
gitis, and 4234 with acute sinusitis; Figure 1) and 4307 (14%)
were prescribed broad-spectrum antibiotics. Differences by
treatment group were noted for race/ethnicity and public
insurance for acute otitis media and group A streptococcal
pharyngitis (Table 1). Children missing race/ethnicity data
(73; 0.2%) were excluded, leaving 30 086 children for the pri-
mary analysis assessed at 14 days after diagnosis. In the
stratified analysis, there were 336 clinicians (median, 54 chil-
dren per clinician; range, 1-442 children per clinician) re-
sulting in 798 diagnosis strata (304 children diagnosed as
having acute otitis media, 202 as having acute sinusitis, and
292 as having group A streptococcal pharyngitis). In the full
matched analysis, covariates stratified by diagnosis were gen-
erally successfully balanced (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
The results for the clinical outcomes appear in Table 2
(the odds ratios appear in eTable 4 in the Supplement). In the
14 days after diagnosis, 956 children (3.2%) experienced
treatment failure and 852 (2.8%) experienced adverse events.
Through 30 days, 2454 children (8.2%) experienced treat-
ment failure and 1038 (3.5%) experienced adverse events.
Broad-spectrum antibiotics were not superior to narrow-
spectrum antibiotics for any clinical outcomes in the strati-
fied analysis or in the full matched analysis. Receiving broad-
spectrum antibiotics was associated with a higher risk of
adverse events requiring clinical care compared with receiv-
ing narrow-spectrum antibiotics (risk at 14 days, 3.7% for
broad-spectrum antibiotics vs 2.7% for narrow-spectrum
antibiotics; risk difference for stratified analysis, 0.9% [95%
CI, 0.3%-1.6%]; risk difference for full matched analysis, 1.1%
[95% CI, 0.4%-1.8%]).
The sensitivity analyses for the 14-day treatment fail-
ure outcome demonstrated that an unobserved confounder
would have to be strongly associated with both outcome
and antibiotic type (relative risk >2.4) to shift the results in
favor of broad-spectrum antibiotics by 1 percentage point.
Similarly, for adverse events at 14 days, the association of an
unobserved confounder with both outcome and treatment
group would require a relative risk of 4.3.
Results for outcomes on day 14 stratified by diagno-
sis appear in eTable 5 in the Supplement. Broad-spectrum

 antibiotics were not superior to narrow-spectrum antibiot-
ics for acute otitis media or acute sinusitis, but were associ-
ated with reduced risk of treatment failure for group A
streptococcal pharyngitis (risk of 1.0% for broad-spectrum
antibiotics vs 2.4% for narrow-spectrum antibiotics; risk dif-
ference for stratified analysis, −1.7% [95% CI, −2.5% to
−0.9%]; risk difference for full matched analysis, −1.3%
[95% CI, −2.2% to −0.3%]). In the pooled matched analysis
to assess the interaction between exposure and diagnosis,
the interaction was not significant at conventional signifi-
cance levels for either treatment failure (P = .06) or adverse
events (P = .06).
Patient-Centered Outcomes
For the prospective cohort, 58 488 children met the inclusion
criteria. Of these, 10 296 children were randomly selected.
The legal guardians of 2981 children (29%) were successfully
contacted (Figure 2) and 2472 children were enrolled (1100 had
acute otitis media, 705 had group A streptococcal pharyngi-
tis, and 667 had acute sinusitis); each enrolled child had a pri-
marycaretakerwhocompletedthefirstinterviewbetweenday
5 and 10. Enrolled children had similar characteristics to
sampledchildrenwhowerenotenrolled(eTable6intheSupple-
ment). Broad-spectrum antibiotics were prescribed for 868
children (35%). The second interview between day 14 and 20
was completed for 2096 children (85%). White children and
those with public insurance were less likely to have both in-
terviews completed (eTable 7 in the Supplement). Differences
bytreatmentgroupforrace/ethnicityandpublicinsurancewere
noted for acute otitis media and group A streptococcal phar-
yngitis (Table 3), which reflect the population that sought care
at academic teaching practices where clinicians had a strong
preference for narrow-spectrum antibiotics.
The first interview revealed that 77 children (3.1%) had re-
ceivedanewantibioticaftertheinitialprescription.For33chil-
dren,thenewantibioticwasadifferentspectrumthantheorigi-
nal. For 22 children, the parent did not report the name of the
new antibiotic. Therefore, 55 children (2.2%) at most were
switched to a different antibiotic spectrum prior to assess-
ment of the patient-centered outcomes.
There were missing race/ethnicity data for 41 children
(1.7%) who were excluded, leaving 2431 for the analysis. The
stratified analysis included 265 clinicians (median, 7 children
per clinician; range, 1-47 children per clinician) resulting in 592
diagnosis strata (220 children diagnosed as having acute oti-
tis media, 221 as having group A streptococcal pharyngitis, and
151 as having acute sinusitis). In the full matched analysis, im-
balance by practice type, race/ethnicity, and insurance re-
mained after matching for group A streptococcal pharyngitis
(eTable 8-eTable 12 in the Supplement).
Broad-spectrum antibiotics were associated with a slightly
worse quality-of-life score and more adverse events com-
paredwithnarrow-spectrumantibiotics,butnoassociationwas
found with other patient-centered outcomes (Table 4). The
oddsratiosappearineTable13andanexplanationofthesample
sizes appears in the eText in the Supplement. The results were
consistent across the stratified analysis and the full matched
analysis. The overall mean PedsQL score was 91.1 (SD, 9.8)
and it was 90.2 (SD, 10.5) for broad-spectrum antibiotics and
91.5 (SD, 9.4) for narrow-spectrum antibiotics (Table 4 and
eFigure 1 in the Supplement). In the stratified analysis, broad-
spectrum antibiotic treatment was associated with a score dif-
ference of −1.6% (95% CI, −2.8% to −0.5%) compared with nar-
row-spectrum antibiotic treatment. The results were similar
for the full matched analysis with a score difference of −1.4%
(95% CI, −2.4% to −0.4%) (Table 4).
In the post hoc analyses, results from the hierarchical
analysis were consistent and the results from the analysis re-
stricted to children with parent-reported symptoms at base-
line also were consistent but not statistically significant (eText
in the Supplement). In a sensitivity analysis, a potential un-
observed confounder would have required a relative risk of 2.7
for the association with both types of antibiotic spectrum ex-
posureandtheoutcometoshifttheestimatefromthematched
analysis to favor broad-spectrum antibiotics by 4.0 points for
the PedsQL score (eText in the Supplement).

 Receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics was associated
with a higher risk of adverse events compared with receiving
narrow-spectrum antibiotics (risk of 35.6% with broad-
spectrum antibiotics vs risk of 25.1% with narrow-spectrum
antibiotics; risk difference for stratified analysis of 11.6%
[95% CI, 6.0%-17.2%]; risk difference for full matched analy-
sis of 12.2% [95% CI, 7.3%-17.2%]). The results of the analyses
that accounted for missing data were similar (eText in the
Supplement). Among the 599 children (28.9%) with reported
adverse events, 69.6% were due to diarrhea; rash, 40.1%;
upset stomach, vomiting, or both, 21.4%; and more than 1
adverse event, 27.8%.
Results stratified by acute respiratory tract infection di-
agnosis were consistent across diagnoses (eTable 14 in the
Supplement); however, there was a limited difference in ad-
verseeventsbyantibioticspectrumforchildrendiagnosedwith
acute sinusitis.
Discussion
This study used a diverse, pediatric primary care network to
compare the 2 prevailing treatment strategies for the most
common childhood infections. Broad-spectrum antibiotics
did not perform better than narrow-spectrum antibiotics on
clinical or patient-centered outcomes, but were associated
with a higher rate of adverse events than narrow-spectrum
antibiotics. These data support the use of narrow-spectrum
antibiotics for the treatment of acute respiratory tract infec-
tions in most children.
Assessingoutcomesidentifiedasimportantbylegalguard-
ians of children with acute respiratory tract infections distin-
guished this work.22 Clinical studies of different therapeutic
approaches that rely exclusively on clinician-observed out-
comesriskmissingdifferentialratesofsymptomresolutionand
adverse events that are meaningful to families. These events
might not be recorded in the medical record either because no
medicalencounteroccurred(eg,diarrheamanageableathome)
or because the parent did not communicate or the clinician did
not elicit or document the effect on the child’
s or family’
s qual-
ity of life (eg, sleep disruption).
The consistency of findings across clinical and patient-
derived outcomes was notable. This remained true in the sub-
analyses by individual acute respiratory tract infection, with
the lone exception of group A streptococcal pharyngitis in the
retrospective electronic health record-based cohort, in which
a lower rate of treatment failure was observed with broad-
spectrum antibiotic therapy. Although statistically signifi-
cant, the clinical significance of this finding is questionable be-
cause(1)theriskdifferencefavoredbroad-spectrumantibiotics
by less than 2% for both the stratified and full matched analy-
ses,(2)theoverallsuccessratewasgreaterthan97%fornarrow-
spectrum antibiotics, and (3) this was not observed in the pro-
spective cohort with the patient-centered approach. Although
adverse events rates were higher for broad-spectrum antibi-
otics in both cohorts, the overall rates of adverse events iden-
tified in the prospective cohort were 10.3 times the rate iden-
tified in the retrospective cohort, which reveals that (1) the
majority of adverse events resulting from antibiotic use are not
reported to (or documented by) prescribing clinicians and
(2) assessing patient-centered outcomes might inform the risk-
benefit ratio of antibiotic use in children.
Limitations
Thisstudyhadseverallimitations.Becausechildrenwereiden-
tified based on clinician diagnosis plus an antibiotic prescrip-
tiontoidentifybacterialacuterespiratorytractinfections,some
childrenlikelyhadviralinfections.Thismisclassificationcould
have blunted the ability to detect a difference between anti-
biotic choices. This approach, however, reflects the true inci-
dence of antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory tract in-
fections and, therefore, captures its association with symptom
resolution, adverse events, and quality of life. Residual con-
founding likely persists, but sensitivity analyses suggest that
this is unlikely to explain the study findings. Although con-
ducted in a large and diverse primary care network, results

 might not be generalizable outside this setting. Because chil-
dren who had received antibiotics within the previous 30 days
were excluded from the study, the potential benefits of broad-
spectrum antibiotics for these children could not be as-
sessed. All pooled comparisons were prespecified, but be-
cause of the multiplicity of end points, comparisons of these
results using conventional levels of statistical significance
should only be made cautiously.
Specific to the prospective cohort study, the PedsQL
was used to capture the outcome of child quality of life. This
outcome was identified as a key concern by legal guard-
iansandchildreninthequalitativestudy.AlthoughthePedsQL
is a validated instrument that captures social, physical, emo-
tional, and school functioning and it has been demonstrated
to be feasible and have good construct and discriminant va-
lidity and responsiveness in measuring short-term outcomes
after minor acute episodes of illness or injury,25,40 it has not
been specifically validated for acute respiratory tract infec-
tions. In addition, prior work estimated that a difference of
more than 4 points on the PedsQL was a clinically meaning-
ful difference.25 Thus, the 1.4-point higher score observed in
children who received narrow-spectrum antibiotics, though
statistically significant, does not necessarily support a clini-
cally superior outcome for narrow-spectrum antibiotics.
Instead, this finding rejects the notion that broad-spectrum
antibiotics provide a clinically meaningful advantage.
Although the relatively high overall PedsQL scores sug-
gest a potential ceiling effect of this measure, the distribution
shift was in favor of narrow-spectrum antibiotics, which was
consistent across most outcomes and analyses, and the sensi-
tivity analysis indicated that there would need to be very
strong residual confounding to shift the PedsQL results in
favor of broad-spectrum antibiotics. In addition, because the
PedsQL was assessed at only a single time point, we could not
assess the effect of antibiotic spectrum on the change in
score from baseline.
The relatively low rate of contact (29%) for the prospec-
tive cohort could have biased estimates if the chances of con-
tact were related to the antibiotic prescribed. However, when
the full sample of eligible participants was compared with
the children included in the cohort, differences in patient
characteristics were negligible. Fifteen percent of families
who completed the first interview between day 5 and 10 did
not complete the second interview between day 14 and 20.
The assessment of only 1 outcome (adverse events) and 2
covariates (race and ethnicity) at the second interview, how-
ever, minimized the effect of these missing data and a sensi-
tivity analysis accounting for the missing adverse event out-
come yielded similar results as the primary analysis.
Recall bias might have affected data collected by tele-
phoneinterview,althoughmostoutcomesandcovariateswere
obtained only 5 to 10 days after diagnosis and it is unlikely that
antibiotic choice was related to the parent’
s ability to accu-
rately report these data. The specific questions used to elicit
theoutcomesfromlegalguardiansbytelephoneinterviewwere
not validated or tested for reliability. They were, however,
tested for feasibility and family partners confirmed the face
validity and clarity of these questions. Some imbalance of race,
insurance,andpracticetyperemainedaftermatchingforgroup
A streptococcal pharyngitis. This imbalance was addressed by
including practice type, which is the likely driver of imbal-
ance in race and insurance, in the response models. Remain-
ing imbalance in season was both restricted to a single season
and inconsistent and, thus, likely to be an artifact. Although
this could have resulted in uncontrolled confounding, results
were robust to multiple analyses.

 Conclusions
Among children with acute respiratory tract infections, broad-
spectrum antibiotics were not associated with better clinical
or patient-centered outcomes compared with narrow-
spectrum antibiotics, and were associated with higher rates
of adverse events. These data support the use of narrow-
spectrum antibiotics for most children with acute respiratory
tract infections.
