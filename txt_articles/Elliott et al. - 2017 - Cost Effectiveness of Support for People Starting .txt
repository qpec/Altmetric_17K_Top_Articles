Abstract
Background The
English
community
pharmacy
New
Medicine Service (NMS) significantly increases patient
adherence to medicines, compared with normal practice.
We examined the cost effectiveness of NMS compared
with normal practice by combining adherence improve-
ment and intervention costs with the effect of increased
adherence on patient outcomes and healthcare costs.
Methods We developed Markov models for diseases tar-
geted by the NMS (hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and anti-
platelet regimens) to assess the impact of patients’ non-
adherence. Clinical event probability, treatment pathway,
resource use and costs were extracted from literature and
costing tariffs. Incremental costs and outcomes associated
with each disease were incorporated additively into a
composite probabilistic model and combined with adher-
ence rates and intervention costs from the trial. Costs per
extra quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) were calculated
from the perspective of NHS England, using a lifetime
horizon.
Results NMS
generated
a
mean
of
0.05
(95%
CI
0.00–0.13) more QALYs per patient, at a mean reduced
cost of -£144 (95% CI -769 to 73). The NMS dominates
normal practice with a probability of 0.78 [incremental
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) -£3166 per QALY]. NMS
has a 96.7% probability of cost effectiveness compared
with normal practice at a willingness to pay of £20,000 per
QALY. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that targeting
each disease with NMS has a probability over 0.90 of cost
effectiveness compared with normal practice at a willing-
ness to pay of £20,000 per QALY.

Key Points for Decision Makers
The New Medicine Service (NMS) appears effective
and cost effective compared with normal practice.
Increased patient adherence to their new medicine
translated into increased health gain at reduced
overall cost that is well below most accepted
thresholds for technology implementation.
This is a simple intervention which has been popular
with community pharmacists and patients, and is
transferable into most therapeutic areas.
Consideration should be given to extending and
evaluating the NMS in other potentially beneficial
areas, and these results are likely to be transferable
into health systems less integrated than the UK NHS.
1 Introduction
Adherence to medication is defined as the extent to which
individuals take their medication as prescribed [1]. Non-
adherence is commonly reported in key prevalent diseases
such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD):
33% [2]; schizophrenia: 52% [3]; asthma: 67% [4]; and
diabetes mellitus: 78% [5]. Non-adherence causes reduced
quality of life, increased hospitalisations and premature
deaths [5–7]. A recent estimate sets the global economic
impact at US $285 billion, 57% of the economic impact of
suboptimal medicines use [8]. Estimated opportunity cost
to the English National Health Service (NHS England) of
health gains foregone because of non-adherence is over
£930 million per annum in just five diseases [9]: asthma,
type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol/coronary heart disease,
hypertension and schizophrenia. Improving adherence
from current levels to 80% across these five areas would
save the NHS £500 million per annum [9].
One effective way to improve adherence focuses on
patients who receive a new medicine for a long-term con-
dition, as they often experience problems that can quickly
lead to a proportion becoming non-adherent over time
[10, 11]. Barber et al. developed an intervention with a the-
oretical basis in the self-regulatory model (SRM) [10, 12],
designed to elicit patients’ experiences with, and concerns
about, their new medicine. This intervention significantly
reduced non-adherence and was cost effective [13, 14]. Its
approach was adopted as government policy [15] and in
adapted form was launched as the national New Medicine
Service (NMS) in 2011 [15] for people starting a new med-
icine for asthma/COPD, type 2 diabetes, hypertension or
antiplatelet/anticoagulant treatment [16]. The design differs
from the original intervention as there are four specified
patient groups associated with high rates of avoidable hos-
pital admissions. The original intervention was delivered via
a centralised telephone service, whereas NMS is delivered by
community pharmacists providing the medicine, either face-
to-face or over the telephone. Accredited pharmacies pro-
vide NMS, are remunerated for each episode of care and have
guidance on how to conduct the intervention [16]. Of 11,495
community pharmacies in England, 10,553 (91.2%) had
delivered the NMS to at least one patient between November
2011 and January 2014 [17].
The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost effec-
tiveness of the NMS compared with normal practice in
changing medicine-taking behaviour, following published
reporting criteria [18]. The incremental cost per extra
quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) generated was deter-
mined from the perspective of the funder (NHS England).
2 Methods
A randomised controlled trial (RCT) has assessed NMS
effectiveness
[19].
At
10 weeks,
NMS
significantly
increased the proportion of patient-reported adherence by
10.2–70.7%, compared with normal practice of 60.5%
[20, 21]. Trial design precluded observation of long-term
outcomes and costs from changes in adherence. Many
benefits of improved adherence are delivered well into the
future. Here, we simulated the effect of observed adherence
increases on patient outcomes and NHS costs by designing
economic models for each drug–disease pair. We devel-
oped this method previously in a cross-therapeutic inter-
vention focused on medication errors [22]. Here, we
combine the results from the NMS trial with projected
harm from non-adherence to generate estimates of patient
outcomes and NHS costs (Fig. 1).

 2.1 Intervention and Comparators, Patient
Characteristics and Outcomes
2.1.1 New Medicine Service (NMS) Intervention
NMS begins with the patient’s initial presentation with a
prescription for a medicine that is new to them in a com-
munity pharmacy. Patients can be referred by their pre-
scriber, self-refer, or the pharmacist can invite the patient
to use the service. The intervention consists of a one-to-one
consultation 7–14 days later, with a follow-up 14–21 days
after that, the whole episode lasting 5 weeks. These are the
points where the pharmacist asks about adherence. Out-
comes were collected by researchers at 10 weeks.
The primary aim of the intervention, which can be face-
to-face or telephone-based (in this study, all follow-up was
via telephone) is the patient-centred identification of any
problems with the treatment and provision of appropriate
support or action [23]. Action may include referring the
patient back to their prescriber (Fig. 2).
2.1.2 Normal Practice
Normal practice was the pharmacist’s usual advice. There
was no planned follow-up.
2.1.3 Study Outcomes
The RCT primary outcome was self-reported adherence at
10 weeks, considered the minimum time required to
demonstrate behavioural change [13].
Patients were contacted by telephone by a researcher
and asked about adherence behaviour using the question:
‘‘People often miss taking doses of their medicines, for a
wide range of reasons. Have you missed any doses of your
new medicine, or changed when you take it? (Prompt:
when did you last miss a dose?)’’ [24]. This is the adher-
ence question asked by pharmacists during the NMS
intervention and follow-up. The patient was defined as non-
adherent if any doses were missed without the advice of a
medical professional in the previous 7 days.
Little validation has been carried out for most self-report
adherence measures [25]. An existing scale, the Morisky
Eight Item Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8), vali-
dated in hypertension, was used to support our primary
outcome measure, and collected via self-completion postal
questionnaire [26]. These results are available in [20].
Sample size was determined according to the primary
outcome at 10 weeks (see electronic supplementary mate-
rial and [19–21]). Sample characteristics and study out-
comes are reported in Tables 1 and 2. The characteristics

 (age, sex, ethnicity, disease area) of the RCT cohort were
very similar to the population accessed from the national
PharmOutcomes records of 451,222 NMS consultations
recorded from October 2011 to 2 December 2013 [20].
With regards to economic deprivation, the median Index of
Multiple Deprivation (IMD) rank for England is 16,241,
indicating that our study population is slightly more
deprived than average.

 practitioners and allied health professionals including
community pharmacists). These data were combined with
NHS reference costs [27] and Personal Social Services
Research Unit (PSSRU) costs [28] (see electronic supple-
mentary material) to derive patient-level total costs.
Comparison between treatment arms at patient level was
made using a two-sample t-test on the original dataset, or
on a bootstrapped dataset, depending on the normality of
the distribution of costs [29]. Mean (median, range) total
NHS costs for patients in normal practice and NMS are
£261 (£121, 0–1669), and £239 (£135, 25–1483), respec-
tively. There was a general trend to reduced NHS costs,
statistically non-significant, for the NMS intervention:
-£21 (95% CI -59 to 150; p = 0.1281).
2.2 Clinical and Economic Impact of Non-
adherence
Six Markov models were developed in TreeAge Pro
(TreeAge Software Inc, One Bank Street, Williamstown,
MA, 01267, USA). The most commonly prescribed medi-
cine within the four NMS areas was used to inform a model
representative of that disease group. Asthma and COPD
were modelled separately due to the different natural his-
tory of the disease and impact of non-adherence. As
hypertension represented over 50% of the cohort, two
models were built to reflect the two most common medi-
cation groups prescribed: calcium channel blockers and
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors—index
NMS drugs for 34.4 and 24.1% of hypertensive patients,
respectively.
The models were hypertension–amlodipine; hyperten-
sion–ramipril;
asthma-inhaled
corticosteroid
(ICS)–be-
clometasone;
COPD–tiotropium;
diabetes–metformin;
anticoagulants–aspirin. Each model had a lifetime horizon
(until the age of 100), an annual (hypertension, diabetes,
anticoagulant), monthly (COPD), or weekly (asthma) cycle
length with half-cycle correction and the UK treasury
recommended 3.5% discount rate for both costs and out-
comes. Age-related mortality was included in each model.
Each model described the consequences of being
adherent to the medicine, compared with non-adherence.
Entry age, disease severity, drug prescribed and health
status in the models were those in the RCT cohort.
2.2.1 Sources of Data and Model Design
Each model is described in detail in the electronic sup-
plementary material. For all models apart from aspirin we
utilised and adapted existing published models to optimise
design (amlodipine [30], ramipril [31], beclometasone [32],
tiotropium [33], metformin [34]). We derived the aspirin
model structure from case–control studies analysing out-
comes in large UK cohorts of patients with a first pre-
scription of aspirin [35, 36].
2.2.2 Literature Searches
A literature search was conducted through Medline,
Embase and Web of Science using treatment pathway-
specific search terms. Databases were searched to the end
of 2013. References in English and limited to humans were

 included. After excluding duplicate records, studies were
included if they examined issues on the incidence, preva-
lence, treatment or resource use of the consequences of
non-adherence. Reference lists of the retrieved references
were hand-searched.
2.2.3 Transition Probabilities
Data came preferentially from up-to-date UK sources that
reflected the NMS trial patient characteristics. The quality
of evidence varied for the different models. Data were
taken from RCTs such as effect of calcium channel
blockers [37] or ACE inhibitors [31] on major cardiovas-
cular consequences in hypertension, and effects of inhaled
steroids on asthma control [38]. Observational data were
available to populate parts of the metformin and aspirin
models. In the metformin model, transition probabilities
are based on UKPDS68 equations [34], using data on 3642
(type 2 diabetes) patients from UKPDS (United Kingdom
Prospective Diabetes Study) for whom annual data on
potential risk factors were available [39]. In the aspirin
model, data were taken from case–control studies analysing
outcomes in large UK cohorts of patients with a first pre-
scription of aspirin [35, 36]. Where no other primary
sources were available, transition probabilities estimated in
published models were used, such as transition probabili-
ties for exacerbations in COPD [40].
2.2.4 Identifying the Effect of Non-adherence on Outcomes
Quality of evidence for the effect of non-adherence on
outcomes varied widely. Where possible, data on the
impact of non-adherence were taken from large long-term
cohort studies, such as the impact of non-adherence to
antihypertensive treatment on long-term cardiovascular
outcomes for the amlodipine [41] and ramipril models [42],
and for myocardial infarction/chronic heart disease death
[35] and for stroke/transient ischemic attack [36] in the
aspirin model. The effect of non-adherence in the met-
formin model was modelled via a higher level of HbA1c
[43], which resulted in estimated higher probabilities of
diabetes complications. We used data from a study ana-
lysing non-adherence to antidiabetic medications (using
MMAS-8 [26]) and HbA1c level in 301 patients with
diagnosed type 2 diabetes in the US [43], good adherence
(MMAS-8 score C3) was associated with 10% lower
HbA1c (p = 0.0003).
Little data on the effect of non-adherence on asthma or
COPD control was available. We derived the effect of non-
adherence on asthma control from baseline data of the
SIMPLE study (observational trial of community pharmacy
intervention
for
asthma
management),
combining
adherence to ICS assessed using prescription refill data in
the previous 6 months and Asthma Control Test [44] (ACT,
0 B ACT B 25) results [45]. The most relevant results
about adherence in COPD were available from Vestbo
et al. [7]. Based on the Toward a Revolution in COPD
Health (TORCH) study [46], they reported that adherent
patients had a 60% [hazard ratio (HR) 0.4; 95% CI
0.35–0.46] lower risk of death and a 44% [relative risk
(RR) 0.56; 95% CI 0.48–0.65] lower rate of severe exac-
erbations [7]. We found no data to inform the effect of
adherence on frequency of non-severe exacerbations, so
assumed
that
the
HR
was
equivalent
to
severe
exacerbations.
2.2.5 Health Status
For the amlodipine, ramipril, metformin and aspirin mod-
els, utilities were based on EQ-5D data from the Health
Survey for England (2003, 2006), adjusted for age, sex and
disease status [47]. Asthma utilities were taken from an
RCT of ICS, using the Asthma Quality of Life Question-
naire (AQLQ [48]) scores [49]. Utilities for the COPD
model were derived from an RCT of tiotropium [33, 50].
2.2.6 Resource Use and Unit Costs
Resource-use data came preferentially from up-to-date UK
sources of observation of clinical practice, with disaggre-
gated resource-use data, to allow attachment of current unit
prices. If possible, individual patient data were used, with
associated measures of mean and variation. If these were
not available, point estimates were used, with carefully
specified deterministic ranges, and standard methods for
allocating distributions to these data were used.
The probability, cost and utility data were assigned beta,
gamma and beta distributions, respectively, and are sum-
marised in Tables 3, 4 and 5. Costs are given in year 2014
values.
2.3 Incremental Analysis
In the base case, we applied probabilities of adherence to
each model, estimated from 10-week trial results, for the
primary adherence outcome measure (Table 2). Adjusted
probability of adherence in the NMS group was 74%,
probability of adherence in normal practice was 63%, and
the odds ratio (OR) (NMS vs normal practice) was 1.67
(1.06–2.62; p = 0.027). Adherence was assumed to stay
the same in both arms over the time horizon of the model.
Each model was populated with probability, cost and
health status data. This allowed the generation of the out-
comes and costs in a cohort who were adherent, and in a
1242
R. A. Elliott et al.
 cohort who were non-adherent to the medicine. The
adherence for each drug–disease pair at 10-week follow-up
in the NMS and normal practice arms were combined with
the appropriate disease-drug-specific model. Using these
models, we generated the difference in patient outcome and
costs between NMS and normal practice for each disease–
drug pair. Probabilistic estimates of costs and outcomes
were derived, the analysis generating 5000 iterations, using
Monte Carlo simulation for each disease–drug pair.
The incremental costs and outcomes associated with
each disease–drug pair were incorporated additively into
the economic model to allow derivation of the total
incremental impact of the NMS intervention costs and
outcomes for all six disease–drug pairs. At this point the
NMS intervention costs were added.
Deterministic and probabilistic incremental economic
analyses were carried out. The incremental cost-per-QALY
generated by NMS over normal practice was calculated
using the following equation:
ðCostNMS�CostNormalpracticeÞ=ðQALYNMS�QALYNormalpracticeÞ:
Utilising Microsoft Excel, we used 5000 Monte Carlo
simulations to obtain the incremental cost-effectiveness

 of the cost-effectiveness plane. We present mean ICERs for
all results, indicating for negative ICERs whether the
intervention is dominant or dominated.
Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) [51]
were constructed to express the probability that NMS is
cost effective as a function of the decision maker’s ceiling
cost-effectiveness ratio (k) [52].
2.4 Sensitivity Analysis
Deterministic analysis was conducted using the MMAS-8
adherence measure, for which probabilities of adherence
were 78 and 65% in the NMS and normal practice groups,
respectively, with OR of 1.88 (1.06–3.34), (Table 2).
The deterministic analysis was repeated to determine the
effect of reducing the effect size, by reducing the adher-
ence in the NMS arm, keeping the probability of adherence
in the current practice arm unchanged. The difference in
adherence between NMS and normal practice that would
be required to attain an ICER of £20,000 per QALY was
determined.
The probabilistic analysis was repeated in the disease-
specific subgroups.
2.5 Model Validation
Validity testing (conceptual model, input data, assump-
tions, model outcomes) was carried out iteratively as part
of the development of the model throughout the project,
with general practice, clinical pharmacy and health eco-
nomics experts on the project team and the independent
advisory panel [53]. This was carried out as multiple ‘walk-
throughs’ and review of specific written summaries of
model structure, inputs and outcomes. There is no com-
parable model of a cross-therapeutic intervention to assess
adherence. However, cross validity of individual models
was maximised by using published models to derive a
model for each disease where possible. The computerised
individual and composite models were developed by LT
and GG and examined by RAE, who has built a composite
model in a previous study. Models were only accepted if
there were no illogical or illegal inputs or outputs.
3 Results
3.1 Incremental Analysis
Tables 6 and 7 summarise the lifetime costs and outcomes
derived from each disease-drug-specific model, their rela-
tive contribution to the economic model, and the overall
results for the incremental analysis of NMS versus normal
practice.
NMS generated a mean of 0.04 more QALYs per patient
than normal practice, at a mean reduced cost of -£139, with
probabilistic means of 0.05 (95% CI 0.00–0.13) and -£144
(95% CI -769 to 73). Therefore, NMS dominates normal
practice, with an ICER of –£3166 (probabilistic mean -
£2638). The probability that NMS dominates normal prac-
tice is 0.78. NMS has a high probability (0.96) of cost
effectiveness compared with normal practice at a willingness
to pay of £20,000 for one QALY (see Figs. 3, 4).
3.2 Sensitivity Analysis
The results were robust to changing adherence outcome.
When MMAS-8 was used to estimate changes in
adherence, the incremental QALY was 0.06, incremen-
tal cost was -£164, with an ICER of -£2953 (see
electronic
supplementary
material).

 analysis demonstrated that the effect size of NMS
compared with normal practice would need to be
reduced to an OR of 1.01 to derive an ICER of £20,000
per QALY or above (see electronic supplementary
material).
The disease-specific sensitivity analysis showed that if
the NMS intervention targeted one of the disease areas
only, NMS generated more QALY gain than normal
practice in all models. NMS generated lower lifetime costs
than normal practice for amplodipine–hypertension and
asthma models. Higher costs in the NMS arm were gen-
erated for ramipril–hypertension, diabetes, COPD and
aspirin models. In all cases, higher lifetime costs were the
effect of reduced mortality for adherent patients (deaths
from
COPD
exacerbations
and
from
cardiovascular
events). The mean ICERs were hypertension only (am-
lodipine plus ramipril): -£115; asthma only: -£44,614;
COPD only: £1845; diabetes only: £293; aspirin only:
£5151 (Table 8). Targeting individual disease areas with
NMS has a probability over 0.90 of cost effectiveness
compared with normal practice at a willingness to pay of
£20,000 per QALY (Fig. 4).
3.3 Model Validation
Where possible, outputs from individual models were
compared with published model outputs. The output of four
of our individual models was comparable with published
studies. The amlodipine model generated 14.3 QALYs in
the adherent group, similar to another UK hypertension
model [54] and a German model [55]. The ramipril model
generated 16.6 QALYs in the adherent group, similar to
another ACEI model [56]. The diabetes model generated
9.62 QALYs in the adherent group, similar to UKPDS68
[34]. The aspirin model generated 10.07 QALYs in the
adherent group. There were no lifetime horizon models
available for comparison, but a 10-year model generated
8.2–8.4 QALYs [57]. We were not able to find models with
time horizons similar to our asthma and COPD models, so
relied on feedback from clinical experts regarding model
outcome validity.
4 Discussion
This economic evaluation suggests that NMS will deliver
better patient outcomes than normal practice at overall
reduced costs to the NHS in the long term. In the short
term, extra costs incurred by remunerating community
pharmacists were absorbed by small reductions in other
NHS contact-related costs.

 Interventions to improve adherence were assessed in a
recent Cochrane review as ‘‘mostly complex and not very
effective’’, and in need of better design [58]. Most strategies
to improve medicines have been costly and atheoretical with
little evidence of cost effectiveness [59, 60]. In contrast,
NMS is an effective, relatively simple intervention with a
strong theory base, transferable across diseases and health-
care settings, and which we estimate here to be cost effective
for the NHS when compared with normal practice.
4.1 Strengths and Limitations
The current UK evaluative framework requires a cost per
QALY to compare the value for money of different
healthcare interventions. Patient adherence is an interme-
diate process indicator assumed to lead to changes in
patient outcomes, but criticised as insufficient to demon-
strate patient benefit [58]. Our analysis has moved beyond
adherence, giving an estimate of clinical and economic

model, cost and QALY in NMS
and normal practice arms are
calculated as weighted cost and

the strength of NMS effect
(incorporating adherence effect

and
is
an
important
development.
Pharmacist-led interventions often reflect their cross-
therapeutic role around prescribing safety and patient
adherence, bringing a significant challenge to the evalua-
tive framework, which is historically disease-specific.
Evaluations of pharmacist-led interventions often rely on
generic process measures such as errors [61, 62], medica-
tion changes [63] or patient adherence [14], and tend to
report ICERs such as cost per adherent patient or cost per
error avoided [14, 61]; or utilise assumptions about the
level of disutility incurred [64]. In a previous study
examining the economic impact of a pharmacist-led
information technology-based intervention (PINCER) to
reduce medication errors in general practices, we devel-
oped a novel approach where economic models were
developed for each of six errors, and generated a cost per
QALY [22]. We applied this method in the economic
evaluation of NMS. Therefore, this study differs from most
other economic evaluations in this area, and we have been
able to generate cost-per-QALY statistics to inform deci-
sion making.
The effect size of an absolute 10% improvement in
adherence from normal practice to NMS is similar to that
reported in the original work by Clifford [65]. Although the
effect sizes here might initially be considered small, we
anticipate significant benefits for two reasons. First, large
numbers of patients have experienced the service. Second,
we suggest that this is a conservative effect size, given
probable patient recruitment bias, use of self-report of
adherence, and the assumption that all the patients in the
intervention arm actually received the NMS.
There is no gold standard for measuring patients’
medicines adherence. Each approach has limitations. More
than one adherence measure should be used to provide an
internal check on validity [1]. In this study, we chose two
self-report measures. Prescription filling was not an option
for routine adherence monitoring in England due to lack of
interoperability between community pharmacy and general
practice systems. Although self-report tends to return a
higher rate of medication adherence (?15%) than some
objective measures, it correlates with objective clinical
measures [66]. It is possible to minimise biases through
confidential interview [67], as is carried out as part of
NMS; normalising non-adherence by recognising the
challenges of taking regular medications; avoiding nega-
tive or positive questions which may encourage a biased
response; and asking about a missed dose in the few days
or a week prior to data collection rather than months or
years [68].
A key limitation is the paucity of data upon which to
base the estimates of economic impact of adherence in the
individual disease–drug pairs, particularly the link between
adherence and outcome. The wide range around the point
estimates of cost effectiveness reflects the uncertainty in
some of the individual adherence models.
Weaknesses in the models centre on assumptions made.
It is assumed that the incremental effect of NMS compared
with normal practice on adherence is the same over a
patient’s lifetime. Published estimates of persistence to
new hypertension medicines at 1 year are around 48%
[69, 70] and 51% [71] dropping from 6-month rates of
65–68%. This suggests that adherence is likely to drop in
the cohort not having NMS at the beginning of their

 treatment. Our study suggests that the effect of NMS
appears to be an absolute increase in adherence of 10% at
10 weeks post-initiation of the new medicine. It is not clear
whether this effect will:
(a)
disappear, such that there is no difference in adher-
ence at 6 or 12 months;
(b)
be maintained, such that adherence in both the NMS
and control groups drops over time at the same rate,
so the current benefit is maintained; or
(c)
initiate a change in the patient’s motivation or ability
to adhere that leads to sustained adherence to the
medicine such that the usual drop in adherence over
time is prevented.
In the absence of any evidence to support which of these
scenarios reflects reality, the economic analysis assumes
scenario (b) for the basis of extrapolation of effect size.
Sensitivity analysis suggested that the OR had to be
reduced from 1.67 to 1.01 for NMS to stop being cost
effective at a ceiling willingness to pay of £20,000 per
QALY.
Apart from general limitations associated with the use of
modelling, specific model limitations in our study include
the use of the same effect of NMS on adherence for each
disease-specific model since the trial was powered to
analyse the effect of NMS in the entire NMS trial popu-
lation. However, the effect of NMS on adherence may
differ between disease groups and, in this case, the results
of disease-specific models would be different than those
assuming the same effect of NMS on adherence. The
effects of adherence incorporated in the models were
observed in the studies with different time horizons, from 1
year to longer (with maximal follow-up 4–5 years), while
in the model we assume that effect of adherence is kept
over a lifetime. We did not incorporate adverse event states
in the models that may affect cost effectiveness (e.g. in
older people, antihypertensive drugs may increase the risks
of falls).
4.2 Implications for Policy and Practice
From inception of the NMS to the end of August 2016,
3.59 million consultations have been claimed for with over
820,000 in the year 2015/16 [90]. From the results of this
economic evaluation, this suggests £75.4 million short-
term savings to the NHS, £517.6 million long-term cost
savings to the NHS and 179,500 QALYs gained.
The research presented above suggests that the NMS is
cost effective for each disease population than normal
practice, with high (above 97%) probability of cost effec-
tiveness at a willingness to pay set at £20,000. On the basis
of this evidence, it is recommended that this service con-
tinue to be commissioned in the future.
Where there is evidence suggesting therapeutic areas
with significantly poor adherence, especially when non-
adherence has significant effect on outcomes, consideration
should be given to expanding the NMS. Potential areas
might include conditions where medicines can have early
adverse effects that subside over time such as anti-
depressants.
5 Conclusions
This study suggests increased health gain with NMS over
normal practice at a cost per QALY well below most
accepted thresholds for technology implementation [72].
This intervention could be extended to other groups of
medicines. The findings are likely to have applicability to
other
healthcare
systems,
including
those
based
on
insurance.
