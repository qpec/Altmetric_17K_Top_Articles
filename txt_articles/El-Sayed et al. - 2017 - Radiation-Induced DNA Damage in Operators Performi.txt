BACKGROUND: Radiation exposure during fluoroscopically guided 
interventions such as endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) is a growing 
concern for operators. This study aimed to measure DNA damage/repair 
markers in operators perfoming EVAR.
METHODS: Expression of the DNA damage/repair marker, γ-H2AX and 
DNA damage response marker, phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia 
mutated (pATM), were quantified in circulating lymphocytes in 
operators during the peri-operative period of endovascular (infrarenal, 
branched, and fenestrated) and open aortic repair using flow 
cytometry. These markers were separately measured in the same 
operators but this time wearing leg lead shielding in addition to upper 
body protection and compared with those operating with unprotected 
legs. Susceptibility to radiation damage was determined by irradiating 
operators’ blood in vitro.
RESULTS: γ-H2AX and pATM levels increased significantly in operators 
immediately after branched endovascular aortic repair/fenestrated 
endovascular aortic repair (P<0.0003 for both). Only pATM levels 
increased after infrarenal endovascular aortic repair (P<0.04). 
Expression of both markers fell to baseline in operators after 24 
hours (P<0.003 for both). There was no change in γ-H2AX or pATM 
expression after open repair. Leg protection abrogated γ-H2AX and 
pATM response after branched endovascular aortic repair/fenestrated 
endovascular aortic repair. The expression of γ-H2AX varied significantly 
when operators’ blood was exposed to the same radiation dose in vitro 
(P<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to detect an acute DNA damage 
response in operators performing fluoroscopically guided aortic 
procedures and highlights the protective effect of leg shielding. Defining 
the relationship between this response and cancer risk may better inform 
safe levels of chronic low-dose radiation exposure.

ecent years have seen an exponential increase in 
the number of fluoroscopically guided cardiovas-
cular interventions carried out by interventional 
cardiologists, electrophysiologists, and vascular sur-
geons, with many of these for pathologies previously 
treated by open surgery. Endovascular aortic repair 
(EVAR), for example, has become the mainstay of treat-
ment in many institutions and is increasingly used for 
patients who would have been turned down for in-
tervention 10 years ago.1,2 The growing number and 
complexity of procedures means that interventionists 
are exposed to higher amounts of radiation, a subject 
that is becoming increasingly topical.3–7 A recently pub-
lished 15-year follow-up study of the EVAR trial, com-
paring endovascular and open aortic repair, reported an 
increased incidence of malignancy in patients treated 
by EVAR.8 There is, rightly so, a significant focus cur-
rently on reducing the patients’ exposure to radiation, 
but mounting evidence suggests that recurrent low-
dose exposure to the practitioner is equally as impor-
tant. Robust data collection to assess the risks posed 
to the interventionist is in its infancy, but a number of 
studies suggest a link to adverse health effects, includ-
ing a higher risk of posterior subcapsular lens changes 
and malignancy.9–11 One recent study found a higher 
incidence of malignancy, including brain cancer, breast 
cancer, and melanoma, in interventionists who per-
formed fluoroscopically guided procedures compared 
with those who had never performed these.12 A better 
understanding of the hazards of occupational radiation 
exposure requires sensitive tools to measure exposure 
at an individual level and clarification of the biological 
effects of exposure.
Circulating lymphocytes are particularly sensitive to 
radiation and may, therefore, offer the opportunity to 
study the acute biological consequences of low-dose 
exposure.13,14 Double-stranded DNA breaks induced by 
ionizing radiation lead to phosphorylation of the his-
tone protein H2AX to form γ-H2AX, with the levels of 
γ-H2AX in the cell peaking half an hour after exposure 
to radiation.15–17 During the acute phase of exposure, 
DNA damage in lymphocytes also results in induction 
of a damage sensor known as the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 
complex, which causes rapid phosphorylation of ataxia 
telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein.18–21 This, in turn, 
leads to phosphorylation of downstream targets that 
act as cell cycle checkpoints, resulting in DNA damage-
induced arrest at G1/S, S, and G2/M as part of the DNA 
repair process.22–24 Expression of phosphorylated ATM 
(pATM), a DNA damage response marker, and γ-H2AX, 
a marker of DNA repair, in circulating lymphocytes may, 
therefore, be a sensitive biomarker of radiation-induced 
DNA damage.15–17,25,26 The use of such biomarkers could 
facilitate a biological assessment of the effects related 
to radiation exposure. The current safe limits for low-
dose occupational radiation exposure have been ex-
trapolated from data obtained from individuals exposed 
to high doses (eg, atomic bomb survivors) and assume a 
linear, no-threshold relationship between exposure and 
cancer risk.27 Emerging data suggest, however, that 
there is variability in tissue response to radiation, the 
safe threshold may vary between individuals, and the 
risk relationship is not linear.14,28
The present study aimed to (1) study the biological 
effect of radiation exposure in operators by measur-
ing pATM and γ-H2AX expression in circulating lym-
phocytes after EVAR, (2) examine individual operator 
sensitivity to radiation exposure using γ-H2AX levels as 
a biomarker, and (3) evaluate the protective effect of 
wearing lower leg lead shielding.
METHODS
Study Participants
Blood samples were collected from vascular surgeons and 
interventional radiologists before, immediately after, and 24 
hours after they performed endovascular and open aortic 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• This is the first study to detect acute radiation-
induced DNA damage in operators who carried 
out endovascular aortic repair by demonstrating an 
increase in the expression of DNA damage/repair 
markers, γ-H2AX, and phosphorylated ataxia telan-
giectasia mutated in their circulating lymphocytes 
immediately after procedures.
• In vitro irradiation studies demonstrated that 
operators had a variable susceptibility to radiation-
induced DNA damage.
• The use of leg lead shielding abrogated the DNA 
damage response in operators.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Conventional dosimetry fails to account for the bio-
logical consequences of radiation exposure to oper-
ators during fluoroscopically guided procedures.
• Safe radiation exposure limits have been set with-
out considering any interindividual differences in 
susceptibility to deleterious effects.
• Wearing lower leg protective lead shielding is 
essential for reducing scatter radiation-induced 
DNA damage.
• The use of cellular markers, including γ-H2AX and 
phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia mutated, 
which readily lend themselves to high-throughput 
sampling, may facilitate individual risk profiling, 
improve our understanding of the mechanisms 
involved in occupational radiation-induced muta-
genesis, and define optimal protection strategies.

repairs. All operators had experience of EVAR procedures and 
beyond their learning curve. The branched EVAR (BEVAR)/
fenestrated EVAR (FEVAR) procedures were performed by 1 
of 4 operators, all of whom had experienced >100 of these 
procedures. Endovascular procedures consisted of standard 
infrarenal EVAR and complex thoracoabdominal, BEVAR, and 
FEVAR. This study was approved by the London‒City & East 
Research Ethics Committee (16/LO/1111) following the prin-
ciples of the Declaration of Helsinki, and written informed 
consent was obtained from each participant.
Procedural Details
All EVAR procedures were carried out in a hybrid operat-
ing theater equipped with the Philips Allura Xper FD20 fixed 
X-ray imaging system (Philips Healthcare). Default settings 
used were a pulse rate of 7.5 pulses per second for back-
ground fluoroscopy and 2 frames per second for digital 
subtraction angiography acquisitions. For both fluoroscopy 
and cineangiography, an x-ray beam filtration of 1.5 mm 
Al combined with 0.4 mm Cu was used. The equipment 
setup and operating staff positioning were similar for IEVAR 
and BEVAR/FEVAR procedures and have been described 
previously.7 The fluoroscopy equipment was controlled by 
a senior radiographer for each procedure. At the start of 
each case, the under table lead shielding was specifically 
checked to ensure that it was in the optimal position. A ceil-
ing-mounted lead shield was available and positioned at the 
operators’ discretion for each procedure. Mobile lead shields 
for the radiographer and anesthetist, lead garments (0.35 
mm thickness), leaded thyroid collars, and leaded goggles 
were used for all endovascular cases. Leg lead shields were 
not routinely worn. A cohort of 6 operators (selected from 
the first cohort of 15 studied) were asked to wear lower 
leg lead shielding (0.5 mm thickness, XENOLITE–TB, DuPont 
Technology, Lite Tech, Inc) as additional protection to sepa-
rately study the effect of radiation exposure on operators 
when legs were protected.
Standard Dosimetry
Electronic dosimeters (Hitachi-Aloka Medical PDM-127; 
Hitachi Aloka Medical Ltd) were used to measure direct 
radiation exposure. These devices recorded cumulative mea-
surements of the dose equivalence of absorbed radiation in 
micro Sieverts for each case. Dosimeters were attached to 3 
different areas on the operator: (1) left breast pocket under 
the protective lead garment, (2) left breast pocket over the 
protective lead garment, and (3) left mid-leg. The dose-area 
product (DAP), fluoroscopy time, and air kerma dose were 
recorded for all procedures.
Flow Cytometry
Venous blood samples were collected from operators in ethylene-
diaminetetraacetic acid tubes (BD Biosciences). Red blood cells 
were lysed using Pharmlyse (BD Biosciences) for 10 minutes and 
then washed in 0.5% BSA/PBS for 5 minutes at 4°C. Cells were 
fixed (Inside Fix, Miltenyi Biotec) for 10 minutes at room tem-
perature, followed by staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-
conjugated mouse antihuman CD3 antibody (Miltenyi Biotec) for 
30 minutes on ice in the dark. Cells were then permeabilized on 
ice (Permeabilisation Buffer A, Miltenyi Biotec) and washed twice 
before staining for γ-H2AX and pATM using antihuman allophy-
cocyanin- and phycoerythrin-conjugated antibodies, respectively 
(BD Biosciences and BioLegend). Allophycocyanin- and phycoer-
ythrin-conjugated IgG isotype control antibodies (BD Biosciences 
and BioLegend) were used in fluorescence minus one samples 
for appropriate gating of γ-H2AX and pATM, respectively. 
Samples were processed on a MACSQuant flow cytometer 
(Miltenyi Biotec) and analyzed using FlowJo software (FlowJo 
LLC). A more detailed analysis of γ-H2AX and pATM expression 
in subpopulations of CD3+ lymphocytes was also carried out 
(Methods in the online-only Data Supplement).
Samples from operators performing IEVAR were also ana-
lyzed for the expression of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase-1,29 
a dedicated DNA repair enzyme, with its expression directly 
correlating with DNA damage caused by base oxidation as 
opposed to double-stranded DNA breaks (see Methods and 
Table I in the online-only Data Supplement for a list of all 
antibodies used). 
For each procedure, the opportunity was taken to collect 
blood samples from the patient to study γ-H2AX and pATM 
expression in their circulating CD3+ lymphocytes using the 
same methodology as outlined for operators above.
Immunocytochemistry
Blood samples were collected, lysed, and fixed as described 
above. Samples were incubated with mouse antihuman CD3 
immunomagnetic microbeads for 30 minutes, followed by 
positive selection of labeled lymphocytes using LS Columns 
(Miltenyi Biotec). Isolated CD3+ cells were permeabilized 
(0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 minutes), washed, and 
stained with mouse antihuman γ-H2AX (5µg/mL; BioLegend), 
followed by secondary staining with donkey Cy3-conjugated 
antimouse (5µg/mL; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). 
Cells were washed and mounted using DAPI gel mount 
(Sigma-Aldrich).
Irradiation of Blood Samples In Vitro
Blood from 6 operators randomly selected from the entire 
cohort of 15 operators studied was collected in ethylenedi-
aminetetraacetic acid tubes and exposed to radiation doses 
between 100 and 1000 mGy using a Darpac 2000 (Gulmay 
Medical) x-ray unit (energy: 80 kVp [half-value layer, 2.0 mm 
AL], 6.9 mA, applicator: 8 cm diameter) positioned ≈25 cm 
from the x-ray source. After red blood cell lysis, γ-H2AX and 
pATM staining and analysis by flow cytometry (as described 
above) was carried out within 30 minutes of irradiation. Blood 
was collected and irradiated on 3 separate occasions from 
each operator, ensuring that they had not performed any 
intervention involving exposure to radiation in the 48 hours 
before sampling.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 7.0a (GraphPad 
Software Inc) and SPSS-22 (SPSS Inc). Where appropriate, 
nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank, Mann-Whitney U and 
2-way analysis of variance tests were used. A P value <0.05 
was considered to be statistically significant.

RESULTS
Peri-Operative Changes in γ-H2AX  
and pATM
Fifteen operators (13 males, 40 years of age [34–49]) 
(Table) carried out 45 procedures, including 15 IEVAR, 
16 BEVAR/FEVAR, and 14 open abdominal aortic an-
eurysm repairs. BEVAR/FEVAR was associated with 
longer screening time and higher DAP (P<0.0001 for 
both) compared with IEVAR (Figure 1). Personal do-
simetry showed minimal exposure under the opera-
tors’ protective lead garment but higher exposure over 
the lead (P<0.0001), particularly at the lower leg level 
(P<0.0001) (Figure 1). An optimized flow cytomet-
ric strategy was used to quantify both γ-H2AX and 
pATM expression in circulating lymphocytes (Figure 2). 
Immunohistochemistry confirmed that γ-H2AX foci, 
absent in both operator and patient blood samples 
preoperatively, appeared in postoperative lymphocyte 
films (Figure 2C).
A significant increase occurred in the levels of both 
γ-H2AX and pATM in circulating lymphocytes of op-
erators immediately after BEVAR/FEVAR (P<0.0003 for 
both) (Figure 3). The expression of pATM increased in 
operators who carried out IEVAR (P<0.04), but γ-H2AX 
did not show significant changes in this cohort. The 
expression of both markers fell to baseline levels in all 
operators after 24 hours (P<0.003 for both) (Figure 3). 
There was no change in γ-H2AX or pATM expression at 
any time point during the peri-operative period of open 
abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
A significant postoperative rise in γ-H2AX and pATM 
in both T helper and cytotoxic T cell subpopulations of 
CD3+ lymphocytes was detected after EVAR, with the 
relative expression of γ-H2AX higher in T helpers com-

pared with cytotoxic T cells (P<0.05 for all) (Figures I 
and II in the online-only Data Supplement).
The deeper phenotyping strategy used to compare 
the relative postoperative levels of γ-H2AX and pATM 
in CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes showed that the in-
creases in γ-H2AX levels were significantly higher in 
CD4+ naïve and central memory cells (Figures I and II in 
the online-only Data Supplement). 
After IEVAR, a significant increase in 8-oxoguanine 
DNA glycosylase-1 expression occurred in the CD3+ 
lymphocytes that expressed elevated levels of pATM 
but not γ-H2AX (P<0.03) (Figure III in the online-only 
Data Supplement).
Changes in γ-H2AX and pATM in operators after 
BEVAR/FEVAR and IEVAR did not correlate with either 
DAP or screening time in either cohort (Figure 3). 
In patients, increased expression of both γ-H2AX 
and pATM levels were detected in CD3+ lymphocytes 
immediately after BEVAR/FEVAR and IEVAR procedures 
(P<0.004 for both) (Figure IV in the online-only Data 
Supplement).
Factors Affecting γ-H2AX Expression in 
Operators
A variable response (P<0.0001) was apparent when γ-
H2AX expression in lymphocytes, sampled from 6 op-
erators, was studied in vitro after controlled irradiation 
using doses ranging between 100 and 1000 mGy (Fig-
ure 4A). At any given dose, some operators mounted 
a consistently exaggerated response, whereas others 
demonstrated a far lower expression of γ-H2AX on 
their lymphocytes.
The same 6 operators were asked to wear lower leg 
shielding during BEVAR/FEVAR procedures (n=9 cases), 
and blood samples were obtained before and after they 
had performed each procedure. Wearing lower leg lead 
protection significantly abrogated the lymphocyte γ-
H2AX and pATM response in operators after BEVAR/FE-
VAR, with no change in the expression of either marker 
immediately after the procedure (Figure 4C). Compa-
rable DAP
, over the leg exposure measurements and 
screening times, suggested that the radiation exposure 
associated with procedures during which the operators 
wore lower leg lead shielding was comparable with 
those carried out without leg protection (Figure 4D).
DISCUSSION
Ionizing radiation can induce different forms of DNA 
damage, such as base pair damage, single-stranded 
breaks, and double-stranded breaks, and the latter 
is considered the most deleterious because these are 
more difficult to repair than other forms of DNA dam-
age.30,31 Left unrepaired, double-stranded DNA breaks 
can cause chromosomal instability and cell apoptosis. 
Incomplete repair leads to deletions and chromosomal 
rearrangements such as translocations and inversions 
that can ultimately lead to mutations.20 These types 
of chromosomal abnormalities have been detected in 
lymphocytes of both patients and hospital staff after 
chronic exposure to low-dose radiation.13,16,17
Circulating lymphocytes are particularly sensitive to 
radiation exposure, mounting an acute response to 
radiation-induced DNA damage, which includes raised 
expression of pATM and γ-H2AX. Elevated levels of the 
latter marker have been demonstrated in patients’ lym-
phocytes after pediatric cardiac catheterization and as 
a consequence of radiation exposure during diagnostic 
CT scanning.17,32 The present study demonstrates an 
upregulation of both γ-H2AX and pATM expression in 
interventionists’ and patients’ lymphocytes after endo-
vascular aortic repair.
Neither γ-H2AX nor pATM has previously been stud-
ied in interventionists performing fluoroscopically guid-
ed aortic procedures. To our knowledge, the present 
study is the first to demonstrate an elevated expression 
of these markers of DNA damage/repair in operators 
exposed to radiation. This finding is of importance to 
the entire community of workers exposed to low-dose 
radiation. A more profound effect was seen in operators 
performing BEVAR and FEVAR, complex and lengthy re-
pairs associated with higher radiation exposure com-
pared with standard IEVAR. We and other groups have 
previously reported that DAP
, fluoroscopy, and radia-
tion exposure is higher for these complex procedures 
compared with standard IEVAR.4,33 In our experience, 
BEVAR/FEVAR was associated with a 2-fold increase in 
DAP and 3-fold longer fluoroscopy time.5 The present 
study confirmed, by personal dosimetery, an ≈2-fold 
higher exposure at leg level for the operator perform-
ing BEVAR/FEVAR as opposed to IEVAR.
Changes in γ-H2AX and pATM were not detected in 
operators after open repair, highlighting that this effect 
is directly related to radiation exposure. This effect was 
absent in operators who wore lower leg lead shield-
ing during complex aneurysm repair, indicating that the 
majority of DNA damage occurs in lymphocytes irradi-
ated in the lower leg tissues and long bones.
Our data also demonstrate interindividual variability 
in the induction of γ-H2AX in operators’ lymphocytes 
when irradiated in vitro, suggesting that susceptibil-

ity to DNA damage may vary and safe exposure limits 
may not apply universally.32 A range of doses, includ-
ing some far higher than those recorded for occupa-
tional exposure, were used to provoke an exaggerated 
response and help unmask differences among individu-
als. Although an increased expression of both of these 
markers was detected immediately after endovascular 
intervention, levels fell back to normal 24 hours after 
the procedure in operators, a finding previously report-
ed in patients exposed to radiation.15–17 A greater un-
derstanding of this reparative response to DNA damage 
is needed to determine the influence of factors such 
as age, sex, comorbidities, and chronicity of exposure 
and whether a complete repair is achieved in dam-
aged cells. Estimates of cancer risk from exposure to 
ionizing radiation are based on epidemiological studies 
of exposed human populations, especially the atomic 
bomb survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. These stud-
ies have provided relatively reliable estimates of risk for 
moderate to high radiation doses.17,27,34,35 However, risk 
estimates for repeated exposures to low-dose radiation 
are based on linear extrapolation using epidemiological 
data from high-dose exposures, making these estimates 
less reliable.36–38 Traditional methods to quantify radia-
tion risk associated with fluoroscopically guided proce-
dures is through absorbed radiation dose or exposure 
indices such as DAP
, which estimate absorbed radiation 
dose. These methods provide a theoretical risk estimate 
that does not factor into individual variations in suscep-
tibility to radiation damage. Measurement of biological 
markers, such as γ-H2AX and pATM, provides the op-
portunity for individual risk profiling, but at this stage a 
better understanding of the long-term consequences of 
the raised levels of γ-H2AX and pATM during endovas-
cular interventions is required.
We found a postoperative rise in γ-H2AX and pATM 
in both T helper and cytotoxic cell populations, with the 
relative expression of postoperative γ-H2AX higher in T 
helper (CD4+) compared with cytotoxic T cells (CD8+). 
Using this deeper phenotyping strategy to compare 
relative expression levels in CD4+ and CD8+ cells, we 
found that postoperative γ-H2AX levels are significantly 
higher in CD4+ naïve and central memory cells. It ap-
pears that γ-H2AX did not rise in CD8+ central memory 
cells postoperatively.
Expanding on the biological significance of the differ-
ential expressions that we have found in T-cell subsets 
is beyond the scope of the present study. The effects of 
chronic radiation exposure on the overall health of sur-
gical operators may only be revealed through long-term 
investigations. Other groups have found that CD8+ cells 
are more sensitive to radiation-induced apoptosis than 
CD4+ cells.39 It is possible that CD8+ cells are less likely 
to persist after being irradiated and be registered as γ-
H2AX-expressing cells.
After IEVAR, there is a significant increase in 8-oxo-
guanine DNA glycosylase-1 expression, a dedicated 
DNA repair enzyme that specifically excises 7,8-di-
hydro-8-oxoguanine, with its expression directly corre-
lating with DNA damage caused by base oxidation.29 
Our finding of higher 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase-1 
expression in CD3+ lymphocytes that demonstrate ele-
vated levels of pATM but not γ-H2AX suggests that the 
DNA damage response marker, pATM, is activated in 
the lymphocytes of operators in response to DNA dam-
age caused by base oxidation as well as DNA breaks 
caused by direct energy transfer.
Protective equipment available to the operator in-
cludes lead aprons, thyroid shields, lead eye protection, 
ceiling-suspended leaded shields, rolling leaded shields, 
radiation-attenuating sterile surgical gloves, and sterile 
lead-equivalent patient-mounted drapes.40 Below table 
lead shielding is particularly important for minimizing 
scatter radiation.41 The stark findings of the present 
study specifically highlight the importance of using leg-
leaded pads by demonstrating that the markers of DNA 
damage detected in operators’ circulating lymphocytes 
were absent when the operator wore additional lower 
leg lead shielding. The electronic dosimeters placed 
over the leg confirmed a significant amount of scat-
ter radiation absorbed at that level—in fact, higher 
than the dose at chest level. The capability of modern 
fixed-imaging systems to produce higher quality images 
compared with mobile c-arms is associated with a sig-
nificantly higher amount of scatter radiation produced 
by the radiation source under the operating table.42 Op-
erators often neglect to wear lower leg lead shielding, 
viewing its use as cumbersome and unnecessary, but 
the present data highlight the importance of protecting 
the legs.43
Dose awareness and training in radiation protection 
are fundamental for minimizing occupational radiation 
exposure. There is currently no mandatory requirement 
for training in fluoroscopic operation or mandatory

radiation protection certification for vascular operators in 
the United Kingdom. However, radiation-exposed work-
ers are encouraged to attend Ionising Radiation (Medical 
Exposure) Regulations training courses. Vascular surgery 
was granted specialty status in the United Kingdom in 
2013, and with this a new curriculum and training pro-
gram was developed. The first cohort of trainees has had 
instruction on radiation protection practices as part of 
their induction into the program. The first sitting of the 
examination for these trainees will take place in 2018 and 
should include questions on radiation safety, reflecting 
the content of the new curriculum.
The current endovascular case mix exposes the vas-
cular operator to relatively high radiation doses com-
pared with, for example, interventional cardiologists 
performing percutaneous coronary intervention. In our 
experience, the per case dose to the vascular operator is 
almost 6-fold higher during IEVAR compared with per-
cutaneous coronary intervention, but it should be not-
ed that interventional cardiologists perform cases more 
frequently (Table II in the online-only Data Supplement).
It is essential that operators adhere to “As Low as 
Reasonably Achievable” principles to minimize expo-
sure to themselves, their team, and the patient. These 
principles include wearing a dosimeter at all times, with 
cumulative doses monitored regularly and leveraged 
use of real-time dosimetery where possible.44,45 Other 
principles include lowering the rate of fluoroscopy 
where applicable, minimizing the use of cinefluorog-
raphy (which produces 10 times more radiation com-
pared with standard fluoroscopy), using collimation, 
and maximizing the distance between the operator and 
x-ray source, remembering that as distance doubles 
exposure is reduced by a factor of 4.46 Finally, closely 
monitoring the orientation and angulation of the x-ray 
source, particularly avoiding left anterior oblique pro-
jection, which exposes the operating team to the high-
est amount of scatter radiation, is key for minimizing 
the absorbed dose.
Limitations of This Study
The present study does not relate the effective radia-
tion doses absorbed during each procedure, calculated 
by taking into account the radiosensitivity of different 
body tissues, to the expression of DNA damage/repair

markers. We have also not established the relationship 
between the acute response (γ-H2AX and pATM levels) 
and cytogenetic markers of chronic low-dose radiation 
damage and DNA misrepair, such as micronuclei and 
dicentric chromosomes. Finally, it is important to stress 
that the biomarkers of radiation exposure measured in 
this study demonstrate an acute cellular response, but 
we do not yet know how this gives rise to an increased 
cancer risk. Relating one to the other would require 
longitudinal measurements in a much larger cohort of 
operators with long-term prospective follow-up.
