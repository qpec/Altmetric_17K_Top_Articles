Abstract
Background
As the Zika virus epidemic continues to spread internationally, countries such as the United
States must determine how much to invest in prevention, control, and response. Fundamen-
tal to these decisions is quantifying the potential economic burden of Zika under different
scenarios.
Methodology/Principle findings
To inform such decision making, our team developed a computational model to forecast the
potential economic burden of Zika across six states in the US (Alabama, Florida, Georgia,
Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas) which are at greatest risk of Zika emergence, under a
wide range of attack rates, scenarios and circumstances. In order to accommodate a wide
range of possibilities, different scenarios explored the effects of varying the attack rate from
0.01% to 10%. Across the six states, an attack rate of 0.01% is estimated to cost $183.4 mil-
lion to society ($117.1 million in direct medical costs and $66.3 million in productivity losses),
0.025% would result in $198.6 million ($119.4 million and $79.2 million), 0.10% would result
in $274.6 million ($130.8 million and $143.8 million) and 1% would result in $1.2 billion
($268.0 million and $919.2 million).
Conclusions
Our model and study show how direct medical costs, Medicaid costs, productivity losses,
and total costs to society may vary with different attack rates across the six states and the
circumstances at which they may exceed certain thresholds (e.g., Zika prevention and con-
trol funding allocations that are being debated by the US government). A Zika attack rate of
0.3% across the six states at greatest risk of Zika infection, would result in total costs that
exceed $0.5 billion, an attack rate of 1% would exceed $1 billion, and an attack rate of 2%
would exceed $2 billion.

 Author summary
Our work forecasts the cost and economic burden of the Zika virus across six states in the
US which are at the greatest risk of Zika (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Missis-
sippi, and Texas). We evaluated the burden by varying attack rates, scenarios, and circum-
stances. All costs are reported in 2016 dollars. This is the first study to determine the
potential economic impact of the Zika epidemic in the US across a wide range of possible
scenarios (e.g., different scenarios explored the effects of varying attack rates from 0.01%
to 10%). There has previously been debate regarding resource allocations to address the
Zika epidemic. Our results are important for decision makers because they identify
thresholds at which the economic impact of Zika on these six US states would exceed $0.5,
$1.0, $1.5, and $2.0 billion. For example, a Zika attack rate of 1% across Alabama, Florida,
Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, the six states at greatest risk of Zika infection,
would result in total costs that exceed $1 billion. Our study also reveals the primary deter-
minants of Zika-associated costs, which can help guide future data collection and control
efforts.
Introduction
As the Zika virus epidemic continues to spread internationally, countries such as the United
States must determine how much to invest in prevention, control, and response. Fundamental
to these decisions is an understanding of the potential economic burden of Zika. For example,
former US President Barack Obama proposed allocating $1.8 billion towards Zika response
programs, which included $828 million distributed towards the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) and $210 million towards the US Department of Health and Human
Services Response Activities, the majority of which was proposed to be allocated to address
Zika on the continental US.[1] US Congress passed a bill that allocates $1.1 billion for Zika
response and preparedness.[1] Critics of the initial $1.8 billion funding request have claimed
that the former President’s proposed budget allocation is excessive, while others have coun-
tered that such an investment is appropriate given the current extent of the outbreak and
potential for further devastation.[2] However, without quantification of the possible economic
burden of the outbreak, both sides of the debate have had limited data on which to base their
arguments.
Evaluating the potential impact of the Zika epidemic can be difficult without the aid of
computational approaches. Zika infection can lead to a constellation of symptoms that include
fever, rash, joint pain, conjunctivitis, muscle pain, and headache[3] that have myriad repercus-
sions on medical costs and productivity. The Zika virus has also been linked to more substan-
tial clinical sequelae, such as Guillain-Barre
´ Syndrome (GBS),[4, 5] and severe birth defects,
including microcephaly.[6, 7] Therefore, we developed a computational model to inform deci-
sion making and forecast the potential economic burden of Zika in six at-risk US states under
a wide range of different hypothetical scenarios and circumstances.
Methods
Model structure
Through substantial adaptation and extension of our previously published model,[8] we devel-
oped an economic model to determine Zika-related costs in six states in the United States
under a variety of attack rate scenarios (Fig 1). We varied the risk of Zika virus infection

 among all individuals living in one of the six states by attack rate and stratified the populations
by pregnancy status to estimate the risk of Zika-related birth defects. In our model, each non-
pregnant Zika case has a probability of being symptomatic or asymptomatic. We utilized the
cost of care for conjunctivitis as a proxy for clinical costs for symptomatic Zika, as
Fig 1. Model structure. The flow diagram above illustrates each of the paths an individual in the model can take in the event of a Zika virus outbreak, given
different probabilities at each node. The model includes all individuals in the six selected states considered at risk for Zika virus infection in the US.

 conjunctivitis is a common clinical symptom of Zika infection[4] and a clear clinical course.
[3] We varied this cost by scenario: 1) an outpatient primary care visit (conservative scenario),
2) a specialist visit (base case), and 3) both a primary care and specialist visit (less conservative
scenario).[9] Symptomatic Zika cases also have a probability of developing GBS.
Pregnant women can be infected or uninfected. Based on CDC guidelines,[10] if unin-
fected, a pregnant woman is still considered at risk for Zika infection and can potentially visit a
clinic to have an ultrasound and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
test performed. If infected, pregnant women have a probability of being symptomatic or
asymptomatic. Both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected pregnant women can be
screened for Zika. Asymptomatic, Zika-infected pregnant women undergo an additional ultra-
sound and are screened using real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) on serum and urine. We conser-
vatively assumed that the rRT-PCR tests on serum and urine are the only tests an
asymptomatic pregnant woman will undergo, although CDC guidelines for asymptomatic
Zika-infected pregnant women can include a Zika virus immunoglobulin M (IgM), a dengue
virus IgM (used to rule out dengue infection), and a plaque reduction neutralization test
(PRNT) depending on initial test results. Symptomatic, infected pregnant women undergo
screening for Zika using all the aforementioned methods (rRT-PCR and PRNT) as well as Zika
virus IgM and dengue.[10] Each Zika-infected pregnant woman has a risk of GBS and a proba-
bility of delivering an infant born with microcephaly and other severe central nervous system
(CNS) disorders. Pregnant, infected women with abnormal results, either by ultrasound or
serology testing, require additional screening, which includes serological testing for other
infections, a series of follow-up ultrasounds, and potential amniocentesis. For each potential
hospital visit (e.g., outpatient, specialist, screenings, ultrasounds), different scenarios evaluated
the effects of varying compliance, from 30% to 90%, a range which included values reported in
the literature (85.8% and 73.7% [11, 12]). The frequency of the tests used for the different at
risk populations can be found in Table 1.
Costs
We estimated costs from the third-party payer perspective (i.e., direct medical costs) and socie-
tal perspective (i.e., total costs; the sum of direct medical costs and productivity losses). In
addition, we calculated the proportion of direct medical costs that would be covered by Medic-
aid. Direct medical costs include the compliance-adjusted costs for all hospital visits and medi-
cal procedures for Zika-infected pregnant and non-pregnant persons, non-infected pregnant
women, microcephaly and other CNS disorders in neonates, and GBS cases.
Productivity losses resulted from both healthcare visits and time missed due to illness, with
median national wage per hour serving as a proxy for the rate of productivity losses.[13] For
the societal perspective, time lost was valued equally regardless of employment status. A
healthcare outpatient visit resulted in 2 to 8 hours of productivity losses, in our more and less
conservative scenarios, respectively (Table 1). Estimates of productivity losses from micro-
cephaly and other CNS disorders came from previous estimates for autism,[14] and another
study was used to estimate the productivity losses due to GBS.[15] The overall consumer price
index [16] adjusted all past costs to 2016 US dollars. In order to capture contributions to soci-
ety that may occur beyond standard employment (e.g., those in school who become ill would
incorporate caregiver productivity losses), our base case scenario incorporated productivity
losses from those formally employed and unemployed. Based on the lifetime total cost and
direct medical cost per person with autism provided by Ganz et al.[14], we were able to calcu-
late lifetime total cost and direct medical cost in 2016 US dollars, $4,109,547 and $593,522
respectively, and apply it to those with microcephaly (Table 1). We were able to do this using

 the lifetime total cost and direct medical cost for GBS estimated by Frenzen et al.[15]
($350,930 and $47,223, respectively).
Since productivity losses are a substantial piece of the total economic burden associated
with a Zika outbreak, sensitivity around these costs are important. As a conservative analysis,
we confined productivity losses to those of employable age (16+). We used state-level employ-
ment statistics to determine the percentage of the working-age population employed either
full-time or part-time in the civilian labor force.[17] We converted this to capture the percent-
age employed across the entire population of each state and used this percentage to recalculate
productivity losses.

 our less conservative estimate for the percentage of CNS cases per pregnant women infected
with Zika.[18] Results from the 2013–2014 French Polynesia Zika outbreak were used for the
more conservative probability of microcephaly.[19] We used the probability of Zika-linked
GBS from our previously published model with data from Brazil and Colombia, namely 0.2,
0.6, and 0.8 per 1000 population infected for the more conservative, base case, and less conser-
vative scenarios, respectively.[8] We used the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule from the Cen-
ters for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for costs of the laboratory testing (Table 1).
Scenarios
This study consisted of running various hypothetical scenarios to explore the impact of varying
attack rates (from 0% upwards) in each of the six states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana,
Mississippi, and Texas). We focused on the Gulf Coast states and Georgia given their suitabil-
ity of environmental conditions to the Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquito vectors
[28, 29] and their relative proximity to the ongoing outbreak in Latin America, including
Puerto Rico. Monaghan et al. shows, the potential range of both these vectors covers most, if
not all of the state.[29] It is unknown what the true attack rate will be in these states, thus we
provide a large range to show how the burden varies under different attack rate scenarios.
While the attack rate for Zika may be similar to that of dengue, as they are transmitted from
mosquito bites from the same species, it also may be higher as Zika can be transmitted through
sexual contact.[30] Additional sensitivity analyses assessed the impact of varying key model
parameters across the ranges parameterized from clinical, epidemiological, and cost data
(Table 1). For example, we varied the risk of microcephaly and other CNS disorders in an
infant born to a Zika-infected mother from 0.95% based on a study in French Polynesia up to
19.05% based on a recent study in Brazil.[18, 19] Other key parameters explored were the
direct medical costs of microcephaly and other CNS disorders, the ratio of symptomatic to
asymptomatic Zika infection, pregnant patient participation in Zika, microcephaly and other
CNS disorder screening, and the hours of productivity lost from different types of care sought
(primary versus specialist care) for symptomatic Zika infections. We report statewide cost esti-
mates (given the range of vectors) and the cost per Zika case, which can be extrapolated to esti-
mate costs for any number of Zika cases (e.g., specific outbreak size, town, city, etc.).
Results
The model covers a Zika epidemic that spans 230 days—a duration determined by fitting the
Zika-related microcephaly outbreak in Northeast Brazil[8] using case data up to June 4, 2016.
[31] The results correspond to ranging attack rates from 0.01% up to 10% across the six states.
The figures show attack rates from 0.01% to 1% to highlight the variability in increasing costs
at these lower rates, while other results show the full range up to 10%.
Clinical outcomes
The key clinical outcomes vary by attack rate for the six states (Table 2). For the base case in
the six states at an attack rate of 0.05%, we estimate there will be 6,470 symptomatic infections,
21 cases of GBS, and 10 children with microcephaly. An attack rate of 0.10%, would result in
12,941 symptomatic infections, 42 cases of GBS, and 20 cases of microcephaly, while at an
attack rate of 0.75%, we estimate 97,056 symptomatic infections, 317 GBS cases, and 150
microcephaly cases. Because the number of cases is dependent on the attack rate and the popu-
lation, at the same attack rate states with larger populations would experience a higher burden.
In Texas, the state with the largest population in the Gulf Coast, an attack rate of 0.05% would
result in 2,522 symptomatic cases, 8 GBS cases, and 4 cases of microcephaly and other CNS

 disorders, whereas 0.10% would result in 5,044, 16, and 9, and 0.75% in 37,828, 124, and 66.
For every 2-fold increase in attack rate, the number of GBS cases increases 2-fold. For example,
at an attack rate of 0.25%, the number of expected GBS cases is 106 and at an attack rate of
0.5% the number of expected GBS cases is 211 (Table 2).
Medical resource utilization
Of relevance to local, state, and federal health care system planners is the Zika-related increase
in medical resource utilization. We estimated that an attack rate of 0.01% would produce 770
outpatient visits for Zika-infected non-pregnant persons, 350,464 ultrasounds for pregnant
women, and 1 amniocentesis for pregnant women, whereas for attack rates of 0.025%, 0.5%,
2% and 10% would result in 1925, 350,411, and 3; 38,501, 348,7464, and 60; 154,002, 343,489,
and 240; and 770,011, 315,449, and 1202, respectively. Under the base case assumption where
60% of pregnant women seek additional screening for infection (screening compliance), each
additional 1% increase in attack rate would translate into 3,505 additional screening visits.
Direct medical costs
Direct medical costs remained relatively insensitive to attack rates for all states, (Table 2) as the
majority of medical costs were due to additional screenings and ultrasounds in uninfected
pregnant women. However, for an attack rate larger than 0.10%, the increasing incidence of
symptomatic Zika infections, GBS cases, and microcephaly/CNS disorders was the main com-
ponent in the direct medical costs. For example, we estimated that an attack rate of 0.05%
across all six states would result in $123.2 million ($42.5-$242.4 million) direct medical costs,
while an attack rate of 0.10% would result in of $130.8 million ($44.5-$289.8 million), and an
attack rate of 0.75% in $229.9 million ($71.0-$763.4 million) direct medical costs (Fig 2).
Direct medical costs vary by the population at risk and the attack rate (Table 3). Symptom-
atic cases excluding pregnant women would result in costs of $1.9 million ($0.26-$6.5 million)
for an attack rate of 0.25% and $15.5 million ($2.1-$52.0 million) for an attack rate of 2%.
Costs for pregnant, non-infected women remain relatively stable because the number of addi-
tional screenings does not change substantially. Cases of microcephaly and other CNS disor-
ders and GBS increase dramatically as the attack rate increases.
Because of different population sizes and birth rates, each state would be expected to incur
very different total costs as well as costs per case, at the same attack rate. For example, at attack
rates of 0.05% and 0.75%, Mississippi would incur direct medical costs of $5.1 million ($1.8-
$10.6 million) and $9.6 million ($3.0-$31.9 million), respectively, while Texas would incur
direct medical costs of $54.0 million ($18.7-$100.2 million) and $99.8 million ($30.9-$333.1
million), respectively (Fig 3).
Medicaid costs
Because Medicaid costs are a subset of direct medical costs, they are also relatively insensitive
to variations in the attack rate (Fig 4). At low attack rates (i.e., <1%), total Medicaid costs con-
sisted largely of additional screenings and ultrasounds in uninfected, pregnant women. As
attack rates increased, a greater percentage of total Medicaid costs was due to additional outpa-
tient visits for symptomatic infections and the long-term costs of GBS and CNS disorders. For
example, in Louisiana, an attack rate of 0.05% resulted in Medicaid costs of $2.6 million ($0.9-
$5.4 million), 0.10% in $2.8 million ($1.0-$6.2 million), and 0.75% in $4.9 million ($1.5-$16.4
million) (Fig 4). Of the six states, Louisiana incurred the highest Medicaid cost per Zika infec-
tion: $1,134 ($391-$2,332) at a 0.05% attack rate, $601 ($205–1,333) at 0.10%, and $140 ($43-
$467) at 0.75%.

 Productivity losses
As can be seen in Table 2, productivity losses comprised a majority of the Zika outbreak-
related costs with well over 50% of costs stemming from time taken for additional screenings
and ultrasounds in pregnant women and the lifetime productivity losses for persons with GBS
and CNS disorders (Fig 5). Total productivity losses were $100.8 million ($26.5-$316.4 mil-
lion) at an attack rate of 0.05% and $703.8 million ($195.1 million-$3.3 billion) at an attack
rate of 0.75% (Fig 2). Productivity losses were attenuated on average by 45% (43–46%) across
the states when analyzing only the population employed. At an attack rate of 0.01%, productiv-
ity losses were $35 million ($9-$121 million) for all states, down from $66 million ($17-$215
million) when the entire population was represented.
Total costs
Total costs are comprised of direct medical costs plus productivity losses (Figs 2 and 6). We
estimated that an attack rate of 0.05% in all six states would yield a total cost of $223.9 million

 ($68.9-$558.8 million) or $6,355 ($1,956-$15,858) per Zika infection, whereas an attack rate of
0.1% would yield a total cost of $274.6 million ($83.0-$879.3 million) or $3,897 ($1,178-
$12,476) per infection, and one of 0.75% would yield a total cost of $933.7 million ($266.0 mil-
lion-$4.1 billion) or $1,767 ($503-$7,680) per infection. Assuming the base case scenario, at an
attack rate of 0.05%, the cost per infection would be $5,939 in Alabama, $5,385 in Florida,
$6,270 in Georgia, $6,688 in Louisiana, $6,256 in Mississippi, and $7,130 in Texas would per
infection. An attack rate of 0.1% would be $3,648 in Alabama, $3,319 in Florida, $3,846 in
Georgia, $4,095 in Louisiana, $3,838 in Mississippi, and $4,359 in Texas per infection and at
0.75% would be $1,664 in Alabama, $1,528 in Florida, $1,745 in Georgia, $1,848 in Louisiana,
$1,742 in Mississippi, and $1,958 in Texas per infection. These costs per infection can be
extrapolated to estimate the cost for any number of cases. For example, 100 cases that occur in
Texas could cost an average of $161,571 to $2.9 million for attack rates ranging from 10% to
0.01%.
Discussion
Given the tremendous uncertainty surrounding potential attack rates for Zika in the US, our
model and study demonstrated how various outcomes and costs would vary based on attack
rate and other circumstances. Our study identified the thresholds at which the economic
impact of Zika on the US Gulf Coast would exceed $0.5, $1, $1.5, and $2 billion. For example,
in the base case scenario, an attack rate of approximately 0.3% would exceed $0.5 billion, an
attack rate of 1% would exceed $1 billion, an attack rate of approximately 1.3% would exceed
$1.5 billion, and an attack rate of 2% would exceed $2 billion in total costs.
Without details regarding the Zika-prevention measures that would be implemented and
how effective these may be, it is unclear what percentage of these costs may be averted. Possible
targets of Zika control investment could be improved vector control, more extensive Zika
screening, and accelerated vaccine development. Assuming a third of the costs could be
averted, an attack rate of 1% would justify investments in the $1 billion range. Such an attack
rate would be substantially lower than those observed in French Polynesia (66%, 95%

 confidence interval (CI) 62–70%),[19] Yap Island, Micronesia (73%, 95% CI 68–77%),[3] as
well as the attack rates for recent outbreaks of chikungunya, a flavivirus with the same vector,
including the Puerto Rico outbreak (23.5%).[32]
Since the US lacks a comprehensive surveillance system for Zika, no one knows the exact
geographic spread of this novel endemic to date, requiring us to rely on assumptions and
hypothetical scenarios. As both Zika and dengue are transmitted by the same mosquito,[29]
one possibility is that Zika’s spread may be similar to that of dengue. The last dengue outbreaks
in the US occurred in Hawaii in 2001, in Texas in 2005,[33, 34] and in Florida in 2010. Despite
the meteorological suitability for the vectors during the summer months,[29] roughly 100
cases of dengue are reported annually in the US.[34] While most cases are travel-related, auto-
chthonus transmission of dengue in the US is becoming increasingly possible.[34] The Zika
virus does have some important distinctions from dengue, such as additional routes of trans-
mission like sexual, perinatal, and possibly transfusion,[35, 36] and the population’s lack of
exposure and thus immunity to the virus (since Zika is a novel virus compared to dengue) that
could further facilitate its spread. Therefore, our study used the assumptions outlined in our
previously published modeling study.[8]
The economic impact of infectious diseases is not always readily apparent and may be signif-
icantly underestimated, especially when manifested in life-long clinical outcomes. Since Zika
may not pose an appreciable risk of mortality to infected adults, it is possible to overlook for the
full extent of its impact. The most publicized effect of Zika has been the risk of microcephaly to
children born to Zika-infected pregnant women. The costs of microcephaly are borne out over
decades and thus may be difficult to evaluate without quantitative analyses. Our understanding
of Zika is rapidly evolving as it becomes apparent that its clinical outcomes include not only
microcephaly, but an array of other congenital impairments, such as vision-threatening ocular
lesions.[37] In addition, our analyses demonstrated that the cumulative costs of uncomplicated,
yet symptomatic Zika infection, are also considerable. While the costs associated with an
uncomplicated Zika infection may seem minimal on an individual level (e.g., an outpatient visit
and lost productivity of no more than one day), these costs can accumulate across the popula-
tion. As has been demonstrated with other diseases, such as influenza, important components
of disease costs are those associated with “milder” clinical outcomes, irrespective of hospitaliza-
tion and death. When such outcomes are prevalent, they can have an impact on employers as
well as society as a whole.[38] Our study shows how sensitive the societal economic burden is to
the attack rate of Zika, which underscores the value of early containment.
As we aimed to be conservative in our estimations, our model in many ways may underesti-
mate the economic burden of Zika. Since there is a dearth of previous estimates of the eco-
nomic impact of microcephaly, we used the costs associated with autism as a proxy. However,
the costs of autism are likely to be lower than those of microcephaly. Microcephaly can result
in a number of clinical sequelae such as significant sensory and motor impairment that would
require greater medical and personal care than most cases of autism. Furthermore, many cases
of microcephaly and other CNS disorders may be difficult to diagnose until infants fail to
reach milestones; weeks or months after birth. These initially undiagnosed cases will have sub-
stantial health burdens, for which the true cost is not yet incorporated into our calculations. In
addition, we did not account for the potential lost productivity and medical costs associated
with stress due to fear of Zika and concern over family and friends suffering sequelae of Zika
infection, as demonstrated by other studies on previous epidemics such as H1N1[39] and
Ebola.[40] Concerns about Zika can also disrupt economic activities, tourism and travel. Addi-
tionally, our study did not consider impact beyond the five Gulf Coast States and Georgia,
although several mechanisms, including sexual transmission and travel, could lead to Zika
cases occurring elsewhere in the US.

 Limitations
The goal of this study was not to predict the course of the Zika epidemic, but to delineate how
the economic burden may vary under different attack rates and circumstances. By definition
models are simplifications that aim to distil systems down to the most pertinent relationships
and key factors without including extraneous detail. While our data-driven analyses drew
from a variety of sources and locations, the current literature on Zika is limited and new data
continues to emerge. For instance, there are wide discrepancies on the reported risk of micro-
cephaly in infants born to Zika-infected mothers. Therefore, we performed sensitivity analyses
to determine how such uncertainty may affect results and to identify needs for future data col-
lection. Additionally, we used laboratory testing costs from CMS reimbursements, which may
differ state to state. Third-party payers typically have financial agreements with medical pro-
viders for a different fee for each medical charge and can be different from Medicaid reim-
bursement. Therefore, our Medicaid costs are an approximation due to data restrictions.
Awareness of the risk for Zika virus may affect the behavior of pregnant women and couples
trying to conceive. However, we did not include any costs associated with the termination of
pregnancy (either spontaneous or planned) as the likelihood of this due to Zika is unknown or
not well established. This analysis focused on six states in the continental United States at
high-risk of Zika infection. While Zika infections may be expected outside of this area, our
model chose to conservatively focus on these regions. In addition, our model focuses on attack
rates that are distributed across the state and are varied across a wide range to account for the
potential impact of vector control activities. With this in mind, the entire population of a state,
including pregnant women, falls under the at risk definition provided by the CDC.[10] How-
ever, as Zika continues to spread beyond the current regions, more of the state could become
high-risk regions.
Conclusions
To inform Zika funding options currently under review, our team developed a computational
model to forecast the potential economic burden of Zika under different scenarios and circum-
stances and the circumstances under which these costs would exceed different thresholds. Our
analyses indicate that the health and economic burden of even low attack rates of Zika in the
Continental US would be both substantial and enduring.
