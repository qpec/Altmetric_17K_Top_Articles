Clinical studies suggest that diets rich in ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty
acids (PUFAs) provide beneficial anti-inflammatory effects, in part
through their conversion to bioactive metabolites. Here we report
on the endogenous production of a previously unknown class of ω-3
PUFA–derived lipid metabolites that originate from the crosstalk
between endocannabinoid and cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxyge-
nase metabolic pathways. The ω-3 endocannabinoid epoxides are
derived from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic
acid (EPA) to form epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid-ethanolamide (EEQ-EA)
and epoxydocosapentaenoic acid-ethanolamide (EDP-EA), respec-
tively. Both EEQ-EAs and EDP-EAs are endogenously present in rat
brain and peripheral organs as determined via targeted lipidomics
methods. These metabolites were directly produced by direct
epoxygenation of the ω-3 endocannabinoids, docosahexanoyl
ethanolamide (DHEA) and eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamide (EPEA)
by activated BV-2 microglial cells, and by human CYP2J2. Neuro-
inflammation studies revealed that the terminal epoxides 17,18-
EEQ-EA and 19,20-EDP-EA dose-dependently abated proinflammatory
IL-6 cytokines while increasing anti-inflammatory IL-10 cytokines, in
part through cannabinoid receptor-2 activation. Furthermore the
ω-3 endocannabinoid epoxides 17,18-EEQ-EA and 19,20-EDP-EA
exerted antiangiogenic effects in human microvascular endothelial
cells (HMVEC) and vasodilatory actions on bovine coronary arteries
and reciprocally regulated platelet aggregation in washed human
platelets. Taken together, the ω-3 endocannabinoid epoxides’
physiological effects are mediated through both endocannabinoid
and epoxyeicosanoid signaling pathways. In summary, the ω-3
endocannabinoid epoxides are found at concentrations compara-
ble to those of other endocannabinoids and are expected to play crit-
ical roles during inflammation in vivo; thus their identification may
aid in the development of therapeutics for neuroinflammatory and
cerebrovascular diseases.

pidemiological evidence suggests that a diet rich in the ω-3
fatty acids (ω-3 FAs) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) promotes beneficial cardiovascular
(1), neurological (2), and anti-inflammatory (3) health effects.
The biochemical mechanisms facilitating these beneficial effects
are yet to be fully elucidated. Mounting evidence suggests that
these actions are mediated through both oxidative and non-
oxidative routes of metabolism that convert ω-3 FAs into bio-
active lipid metabolites.
One of the nonoxidative pathways involves the conversion of
the ω-3 FAs DHA and EPA into docosahexaenoyl ethanolamide
(DHEA) and eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamide (EPEA) (Fig. 1)
through the N-acyl ethanolamine synthesis pathway similar to
the conversion of arachidonic acid (AA) into arachidonoyl
ethanolamine (AEA, anandamide) (4, 5). The endocannabinoids
AEA, DHEA, and EPEA exert effects similar to those of Δ9-
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active ingredient of Cannabis
sativa. Endocannabinoids play important physiological roles that
are exerted primarily through the activation of cannabinoid receptor-1
(CB1) and -2 (CB2) (6, 7). CB1 is found predominantly in the CNS,
and CB2 is found in both peripheral and CNS immune cells (8).
AEA signals through both cannabinoid receptors and regulates
physiological processes in both the CNS and peripheral tissues (4,
5, 9). DHEA exhibits anticancer (4, 5), anti-inflammatory (10),
and synaptogenic (11) properties and has been detected in both
the brain and retina at concentrations comparable to those of AEA
(12–14). EPEA also has been shown to activate anti-inflammatory
pathways (Fig. 1) (10). Interestingly, dietary supplementation with
EPA and DHA resulted in increased levels of EPEA and DHEA
at the expense of AEA, thereby providing a means for increasing
the levels of ω-3 endocannabinoids through dietary consumption
(15, 16).
Endocannabinoids are further metabolized by eicosanoid-
synthesizing enzymes from the cyclooxygenase (COX), lip-
oxygenase (LOX), and cytochrome P450 epoxygenase (CYP)
pathways to generate complex lipid metabolites with distinct
biological functions (17). Recently it was shown that DHEA is a
substrate for enzymes of the LOX and COX pathways to yield
metabolites with anti-inflammatory properties (18, 19). How-
ever, studies examining EPEA or DHEA metabolism by members
of the CYP epoxygenase pathway are lacking. CYP epoxygenases
convert AA, DHA, and EPA into epoxides that are generally anti-
inflammatory, vasodilatory, and antinociceptive in nature (20). Pre-
viously, it was shown that AEA is converted to epoxyeicosatrienoic-
ethanolamide (EET-EA) by different CYP epoxygenases, including
Significance
The health benefits of ω-3 fatty acids are mediated, in part,
through metabolic conversion to bioactive epoxides. Here we de-
tail the discovery and initial characterization of naturally occurring
ω-3–derived endocannabinoid epoxides that are formed via en-
zymatic oxidation of ω-3 endocannabinoids by cytochrome P450s.
These dual functional ω-3 endocannabinoid epoxides are anti-
inflammatory and vasodilatory and reciprocally modulate plate-
let aggregation. By virtue of their physiological properties, they
are expected to play important roles in neuroinflammation and
in cerebrovascular diseases such as stroke.

 CYP2J2 (Fig. 1) (21). It was further demonstrated that one of the
EET-EA regioisomers selectively binds CB2 with 1,000-fold greater
affinity than CB1 (22). These results provide a mechanism by which
the CYP epoxygenases metabolize endocannabinoids to produce
endocannabinoid epoxides that are anti-inflammatory CB2 ag-
onists (22).
Herein, we used targeted lipidomics methods to quantitate
the endogenous levels of the ω-3 endocannabinoid epoxides
epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid-ethanolamide (EEQ-EA) and epox-
ydocosapentaenoic acid-ethanolamide (EDP-EA) in rat tissues
and human blood. The direct in vitro production of these me-
tabolites was demonstrated in rat brain microsomes, activated
BV-2 microglia cells, and recombinant human CYP2J2 (Fig. 1).
Additionally, the rates of hydrolysis/inactivation of these metabo-
lites were measured for the epoxide and endocannabinoid motifs
via soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) and fatty acid amide hydrolase
(FAAH), respectively.
In this work we also report the characterization of the bioactivity
of ω-3 endocannabinoid epoxides. These bifunctional metabolites
contain both ethanolamide and epoxide motifs that function through
different signaling pathways with many overlapping functional out-
comes. Anti-inflammatory effects are common to both motifs, and,
given the presence of these metabolites in the brain, we explored
their potential role in a model of neuroinflammation using microglial
cells. Additionally, because these epoxides are widely distributed in
the periphery and because ω-3 FA epoxides are known to be vaso-
active, we studied the “epoxide-like” property of these molecules by
measuring vasodilation in bovine coronary artery, angiogenesis in
human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs), and platelet
aggregation in washed human platelets.
Taking these findings together, we identify a class of bioactive
lipids that we termed “ω-3 endocannabinoid epoxides,” EDP-EA
and EEQ-EA. They are present endogenously and are produced
through direct epoxygenation by CYP epoxygenases to yield anti-
inflammatory and vasoactive lipid mediators. These metabolites
provide targets for the development of therapeutics in the ongoing
search for nonaddictive, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and vasodilatory
molecules.
Results
The ω-3 Endocannabinoid Epoxides Are Endogenous Lipids in the
Brain and Peripheral Tissues. Previously, a wide range of N-acyl
amide lipids have been quantified successfully using HPLC
coupled with fluorescence detection (23), GC-MS (24), LC-MS
(25), and Ag+ coordination LC-MS/MS in the selected reaction
monitoring (SRM) mode (26, 27). As shown in Fig. 2A, a LC-
MS/MS method in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)
mode was developed to identify structurally and to quantitate
DHEA epoxide (EDP-EA) regioisomers (19,20-, 16,17-, 13,14-,
10,11-, and 7,8-), EEQ-EA regioisomers (17,18-, 14,15-, 11,12-,
8,9-, and 5,6-), EPEA, DHEA, and AEA. The authentic stan-
dards of EEQ-EA and EDP-EA regioisomers were prepared in
a two-step synthesis process and were purified using HPLC as
reported in Experimental Procedures.
The target endocannabinoid metabolites were extracted from
the tissues using a two-step extraction method followed by LC-
MS/MS (27). To estimate the basal levels of the endogenous
EEQ-EA and EDP-EA regioisomers, three sets of pooled (n =
3) Sprague–Dawley rat brain, spleen, heart, liver, and kidneys
were extracted and analyzed. As shown in Fig. 2B, both classes of
EEQ-EA and EDP-EA metabolites were measured in rat brain,
with the two terminal epoxides, 17,18-EEQ-EA and 19,20-EDP-
EA, quantified as the predominant metabolites. A similar trend
was observed in peripheral organs, with both classes of metab-
olites being found in all tissues analyzed (Fig. 2C and SI Appendix,
Table ST1). Specifically, the values of 17,18-EEQ-EA were rela-
tively consistent among tissues from brain, spleen, heart, liver, and
kidney, with levels varying from 60 to 90 pmol/g; the values of
19,20-EDP-EA were more variable, with levels in brain, spleen,
heart, liver, and kidney measured at 70–400 pmol/g (Fig. 2C and SI
Appendix, Table ST1).
Fig. 1.
Overview of the CYP epoxygenase-mediated metabolism of endo-
cannabinoids. Both ω-6 and ω-3 dietary fatty acids are stored in plasma
membrane and can be converted to the ω-6 and ω-3 endocannabinoids AEA,
DHEA, and EPEA. AEA, EPEA, and DHEA are substrates for CYP epoxygenases.
The metabolism of AEA produces EET-EA metabolites (the 14,15-EET-EA
regioisomer is shown). The metabolism of EPEA and DHEA by CYP epoxygenases
leads to the formation of EEQ-EA and EDP-EA, respectively. The terminal
endocannabinoid epoxide regioisomer is shown, and other possible epoxides
at each double bond are denoted by the numbering system.

 Notably, the levels of DHEA extracted from tissues were com-
parable to the levels of 19,20-EDP-EA and AEA. Conversely, rel-
atively low levels of the EPEA parent compound were detected, with
levels significantly lower than those of 17,18-EEQ-EA. Importantly,
the relatively higher DHEA levels and lower EPEA levels are con-
sistent with reports in the literature (10), lending credibility to the
quantitative values. Some of the metabolites also were detected at
lower levels in porcine brains and in pooled human plasma (SI
Appendix, Table ST1). To compare the levels of these metabolites
with those of the better-known epoxyeicosanoids, we developed a
LC-MS/MS method to monitor all nine comparable metabolites—
14,15-EET, 17,18-EEQ, 19,20-EDP, 14,15-EET-EA, 17,18-EEQ-
EA, 19,20-EDP-EA, AEA, DHEA, and EPEA—simultaneously.
Notably, in rat brain tissues analyzed using this LC-MS/MS method
the relative percentages of the epoxyeicosanoids (EETs, EEQs, and
EDPs) and endocannabinoid epoxides (EET-EAs, EEQ-EAs, and
EDP-EAs) were determined to be 79.2 and 20.8%, respectively.
Therefore, the relative levels of the epoxyeicosanoids were ap-
proximately fourfold greater than those of the endocannabinoid
epoxides. The detection of the ω-3 endocannabinoid epoxides in the
different rat tissues warranted further investigation of their pro-
duction in live microglial cells.
EEQ-EA and EDP-EA Are Naturally Produced by LPS-Stimulated BV-2
Microglial Cells. Microglial cells are metabolically active brain
macrophages that continuously survey the brain parenchyma and
maintain homeostasis. If microglia encounter harmful endoge-
nous ligands and microbes, they display proinflammatory activity
followed by anti-inflammatory activity to promote defense and
healing, respectively. Previously, it was demonstrated that acti-
vation of BV-2 microglia resulted in the up-regulation of CYPs
that metabolized AEA to form EET-EA regioisomers when
supplemented with AEA (22). Given the endogenous presence
of EPEA and DHEA in the brain (Fig. 2B), we explored me-
tabolite production by quiescent and activated BV-2 microglial
cells in a post-LPS stimulation time course. As shown in SI
Appendix, Table ST2, both EEQ-EA and EDP-EA metabolites
are naturally produced at 1 h after LPS stimulation and persist
throughout a 12-h period. Similarly, EPEA and AEA were ob-
served at 4 h after LPS stimulation, and at 12 h poststimulation
the level of these metabolites was more than an order of mag-
nitude greater than that of the ω-3 endocannabinoid epoxides.
To test whether activated BV-2 microglial cells could directly
convert the EPEA and DHEA parent compounds into EEQ-EA
and EDP-EA metabolites, we analyzed metabolite production in
cell medium supplemented with either EPEA or DHEA for 30 min.
As shown in Fig. 2 D and E, EPEA and DHEA were rapidly con-
verted to all EEQ-EA and EDP-EA regioisomers, respectively.
Total levels of EEQ-EAs were approximately one order of mag-
nitude greater than those of EDP-EAs. Importantly, the production
of both the EEQ-EA and EDP-EA metabolites was reduced when
cells were preincubated with the CYP inhibitor ketoconazole (0.5 μM),
thus showing that the ω-3 endocannabinoid epoxides are produced
enzymatically through the CYP epoxygenase pathway. It is known
that inflammatory conditions increase the expression levels of CYPs
and their metabolites (22). Indeed, our studies show that under in-
flammatory conditions the levels of all ω-3 endocannabinoid epoxide
metabolites are also increased and are synthesized primarily by CYPs.
Epoxygenation of EPEA and DHEA by Rat Brain Microsomes. To
evaluate the ability of the rat brain CYPs to epoxygenate EPEA
and DHEA directly, we performed metabolism studies in which

 we incubated rat brain microsomes with substrate in the presence
of the CYP redox partner cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) and
NADPH. As shown in Fig. 3A, when EPEA was used as the
substrate, the microsomal CYP epoxygenases produced all the
EEQ-EA regioisomers, with catalytic preference for the terminal
olefin (17,18-EEQ-EA), which accounted for 46% of the total
epoxide product. Similarly, when DHEA was used in the reac-
tions, epoxygenases produced all the EDP-EA regioisomers, with
preference for the terminal olefin (19,20-EDP-EA), which accounted
for 48% of total epoxide formed (Fig. 3B).
In an effort to understand the substrate specificity and regio-
selectivity when both substrates are present, we performed rat
brain microsomal incubations in the presence of equimolar amounts
of EPEA and DHEA (Fig. 3C). Notably, there was some evidence
of competition between EPEA and DHEA, because the total EEQ-
EA and EDP-EA products were reduced in this reaction. Because
the rat CYP epoxygenases are enzymatically different from human
CYP epoxygenases, we also demonstrated a similar metabolism
profile using porcine brain microsomes (SI Appendix, Fig. S1), which
contain a CYP2J isozyme with homology similar to human CYP2J2
(28). Taken together, these findings suggest that similar CYP
epoxygenases are implicated in the metabolism of both DHEA
and EPEA and that there is competition for the substrates
among the various CYP isoforms in rat brain microsomes. Mi-
crosomes contain various CYP epoxygenase enzymes; therefore
it was important to identify which isoform is responsible for the
formation of these metabolites in humans.
Recombinant Human CYP2J2 Incorporated into Nanodiscs Directly
Epoxygenates EPEA and DHEA to Form EEQ-EA and EDP-EA Metabolites.
The identification of a human CYP that forms the ω-3 endo-
cannabinoid metabolites was important for the direct trans-
lational relevance of our findings to humans. Human CYP2J2
epoxygenates AEA and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) (28) and
is physiologically relevant, because it is the second most highly
expressed P450 in the human brain (29) and is the most highly
expressed P450 in human cardiomyocytes (30). However, the
cross-species studies are not completely translatable, because
BV-2 microglial cells are derived from mice, which have 10 sub-
family CYP2J isozymes (CYP2J-5, -6, -7, -8, -9, -11, -12, -13, -14, -15)
but lack a comparable CYP2J2 isozyme, making comparative
species studies more difficult (31). Importantly, we show that
coincubation of BV-2 microglia with a broad inhibitor of CYP
enzymes (ketoconazole) significantly reduces the levels of the
EEQ-EA and EDP-EA regioisomers (Fig. 2 D and E). These
data show that, despite the differences in the CYP isoforms in
different animals (mouse vs. rat vs. human), the production of
the ω-3 endocannabinoid epoxides is driven by the CYP enzymes.
In humans, the epoxygenase pathway is mediated predominantly
by CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2J2. Notably, these isozymes were
previously shown to convert EPA and DHA into EEQ and EDP
monoepoxides, respectively (32).
CYP2J2 was recombinantly expressed and was incorporated
with its redox partner into nanodiscs (28). The first indication that
the CYP2J2-CPR nanodiscs could use EPEA and DHEA as
substrates was found using LC-electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS
(SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Using LC-MS/MS for quantitation, we
generated kinetic curves for both EPEA and DHEA metabolism.
As shown in Fig. 3D, CYP2J2 nanodisc metabolism of EPEA into
EEQ-EA regioisomers followed Michaelis–Menten kinetics (Vmax, Km,
and Vmax/Km values are listed in the table in Fig. 3D, Upper Right).
Notably, CYP2J2 demonstrated a preference for the EPEA
(80 μM) terminal olefin (the average regioselectivity of the
different regioisomers is reported in Fig. 3D, Upper Middle).
CYP2J2 nanodisc metabolism of DHEA produced EDP-EA
regioisomers following Michaelis–Menten kinetics (Vmax, Km,
and Vmax/Km are listed in the adjacent table, Fig. 3D, Lower Right).
The CYP2J2 enzyme demonstrated a dramatic preference for
the DHEA terminal olefin; the average regioselectivity for each
regioisomer is reported in Fig. 3D, Lower Middle. Therefore, we
demonstrate that CYP2J2 metabolizes EPEA and DHEA with
substantially higher efficiency than the rates reported for EPA or
DHA (33). Because the terminal epoxides 17,18-EEQ-EA and
19,20-EDP-EA were produced predominantly by the CYP en-
zymes, their further characterization and biological activity was
measured using these epoxides.
Hydrolysis of 17,18-EEQ-EA and 19,20-EDP-EA by sEH and FAAH. The
EEQ-EA and EDP-EA metabolites contain both epoxide and
ethanolamide motifs (Fig. 1). Therefore, we evaluated whether
these metabolites are targets for both sEH and FAAH. Bioactive
fatty acid epoxides are short-lived lipid mediators because they are
rapidly inactivated by sEH in vivo. Previous studies have shown
that EEQ and EDP are hydrolyzed to their less active di-hydroxy
metabolites by sEH (34). To determine if sEH hydrolyzes 17,18-
EEQ-EA and 19,20-EDP-EA into their corresponding vicinal
diols, 17,18-DiHETE-EA and 19,20-DiHDPA-EA (Fig. 3E),
we developed a LC-MS/MS method of quantitating the diols. In-
cubations containing 17,18-EEQ-EA or 19,20-EDP-EA with sEH
were performed. Enzyme kinetics were estimated and fitted to
the Michaelis–Menten equation. As shown in Fig. 3F, 17,18-
EEQ-EA was hydrolyzed rapidly with a Vmax/Km value of 77.7 ±
1.9 nmol·min−1·mg−1 sEH. Interestingly, the metabolism of
19,20-EDP-EA was substantially slower, with a Vmax/Km value of
12.3 ± 0.2 nmol·min−1· mg−1 sEH (Fig. 3G).
In separate studies, 17,18-EEQ-EA hydrolysis to 17,18-EEQ
by rat forebrains containing FAAH was approximately threefold
faster than the conversion of 19,20-EDP-EA to 19,20-EDP (SI
Appendix, Fig. S3). Taken together, these results show that both
17,18-EEQ-EA and 19,20-EDP-EA are hydrolyzed efficiently by
human sEH and FAAH with the 17,18-EEQ-EA metabolite
preferred over 19,20-EDP-EA.
Anti-Inflammatory Signaling Actions of 17,18-EEQ-EA and 19,20-EDP-EA.
One of the striking hallmarks of ongoing inflammation in neuro-
degenerative diseases is chronic microglial activation (35). There is
a strong interest in unearthing lipid metabolites that can reduce
microglial activation and thereby combat neuroinflammation.
Several studies indicate that the endocannabinoids reduce
microglial-promoted neuroinflammation through CB2 activation.
Consequently, there is a strong interest in the discovery of endo-
cannabinoid derivatives that are CB2-preferring/-selective agonists
as means of mitigating inflammatory pathologies (8, 36, 37). The
17,18-EEQ-EA and 19,20-EDP-EA metabolites have N-acyl
ethanolamide endocannabinoid functional motifs that also are
produced endogenously by activated BV-2 microglia cells (SI Ap-
pendix, Table ST2). Moreover the expression of microglial CYPs
increases under inflammatory conditions (22) and facilitates the
formation of PUFA epoxides that also are involved in anti-
inflammatory action in the brain (38). Hence we examined the
anti-inflammatory effects of these molecules using LPS-stimulated
microglial cells.
As shown in Fig. 4A, 17,18-EEQ-EA dose-dependently decreased
LPS-induced production of IL-6 and nitrite while decreasing LPS-
induced cytotoxicity in BV-2 cells, further demonstrating nullification
of the proinflammatory effects (39). We also observed significant
production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (Fig. 4A). More
potent dose-dependent inhibition was measured when 19,20-EDP-
EA was used, as evidenced by significant inhibition of IL-6 and ni-
trite production at concentrations ≥2.5 μM (Fig. 4B). Moreover, the
LPS-induced cytotoxicity was significantly decreased at doses ≥5 μM.
The 19,20-EDP-EA metabolite also promoted the production of
IL-10 in the presence of LPS. Additionally, in BV-2 microglia, 17,18-
EEQ-EA and 19,20-EDP-EA were more potent inhibitors of nitrite
production than 17,18-EEQ and 19,20-EDP (SI Appendix, Fig. S10).

 also found to have some anti-inflammatory effects that were partially
reversible when the CYP2J, CYP2C, and CYP2D subfamilies were
inhibited by the addition of danazol (40). However, danazol did not
reverse DHEA anti-inflammatory effects, possibly because it is a
substrate for enzymes of the COX and LOX pathways that also
produce anti-inflammatory metabolites (18, 19).
Both epoxyeicosanoids and endocannabinoids function through
multiple receptors and confer complex anti-inflammatory actions (9,
41). Therefore we performed mechanistic studies with selected in-
hibitors to delineate the mechanism of the anti-inflammatory action
(Fig. 4 C and D and SI Appendix, Fig. S4). Using a CB2-selective
antagonist (AM630) or a PPARγ-selective antagonist (GW9662),
we consistently observed a partial reversal of the anti-inflammatory
effects of both metabolites, indicating that CB2 and PPARγ
are involved in mediating the anti-inflammatory action of
17,18-EEQ-EA (Fig. 4C) and 19,20-EDP-EA (Fig. 4D). Lastly,
the anti-inflammatory effects of the compounds were confirmed
at 5 μM using freshly isolated piglet microglia cells stimulated
with LPS, which diminished IL-6 production and thus validated
the anti-inflammatory actions of these metabolites in primary
microglial cells (SI Appendix, Fig. S5).
Determination of the Activation of CB1 and CB2 by AEA, 2-AG, DHEA,
EPEA, 17,18-EEQ-EA, and 19,20-EDP-EA Using the β-Arrestin Recruitment
PRESTO-Tango Assay. Previously it was shown that CYP-mediated
epoxidation of both AEA and 2-AG produced metabolites with
increased CB2 binding and activation (22, 26). Additionally,
as shown in Fig. 4 C and D, we determined that the anti-
inflammatory action of the ω-3 endocannabinoid epoxides is me-
diated partly by CB2. In the literature, EPEA and DHEA are
reported to be weak agonists of the cannabinoid receptors (10).
To explore if oxygenation of EPEA or DHEA by CYPs led to the
formation of metabolites with altered cannabinoid receptor ac-
tivity, we performed receptor functional assays using a β-arrestin
recruitment PRESTO-Tango assay (42).
We measured the functional activation of CB1 and CB2 for
EDP-EA, EEQ-EA, DHEA, and EPEA at 10 μM and for AEA
and 2-AG at 5 μM using the β-arrestin recruitment PRESTO-
Tango assay (SI Appendix, Fig. S12). As shown in this figure, the
DHEA parent compound was a weak agonist of CB2 with little
activation of CB1. However, the DHEA epoxides 19,20-EDP-
EA and 16,17-EDP-EA were more potent functional activators
of both cannabinoid receptors with a greater preference for CB2.
Similarly, the EPEA parent compound was a weak agonist of
CB1 with negligible activation of CB2, whereas the EPEA ep-
oxides 17,18-EEQ-EA and 14,15-EEQ-EA exhibited significant
CB2 activation. Additionally, to gauge the potency at which
these compounds act on CB1 and CB2, we performed functional
dose–response studies for AEA, 2-AG (Fig. 4G), DHEA, 19,20-
EDP-EA (Fig. 4F), EPEA, and 17,18-EEQ-EA (Fig. 4E) and
calculated the EC50 values (SI Appendix, Table ST3). The EC50
value of CP 55940 was similar to those reported in the litera-
ture (43). 2-AG activates both receptors with similar potency,
whereas AEA activates CB1 with much higher potency than
CB2. In the functional dose–response studies, 19,20-EDP-EA
binds with a slight preference for CB2, and DHEA also shows
Fig. 4.
Effects of 17,18-EEQ-EA and 19,20-EDP-EA on LPS-stimulated BV-2 microglial cells and signaling properties. (A and B) In dose-response studies,
BV-2 microglial cells were pretreated with 17,18-EEQ-EA (A) or 19,20-EDP-EA (B) for 4 h followed by LPS (25 ng/mL) stimulation. The culture medium was
collected after 24 h and was analyzed for the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and NO and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. LDH production was
measured to assess cell toxicity in LPS in stimulated BV-2 microglia (n = 6). (C and D) The potential targets of 17,18-EEQ-EA (C) and 19,20-EDP-EA (D) were
studied using AM630 (a CB2-specific inhibitor) and GW9662 (a PPARγ-specific inhibitor) to gauge the reversal of the anti-inflammatory effects by monitoring
nitrite production (n = 6). (E–G) Dose–response curves were generated by monitoring the relative luminescence of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR1) and
cannabinoid receptor 2 (CNR2) PRESTO-Tango gene-transfected HTLA cells as described in SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods for 17,18-EEQ-EA, EPEA, and
CP 55940 (E), 19,20-EDP-EA, DHEA, and CP 55940 (F), and AEA, 2-AG, and CP 55940 (G). Values shown are the mean ± SEM of experiments performed multiple
times (n = 3–7). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001.

 a preference for CB2 with very weak activation of CB1. In
our studies EPEA and 17,18-EEQ-EA activate both CB1 and
CB2 with high potency. Qualitatively, these findings support the
hypothesis that the CYP-mediated epoxygenation of ω-6 and
ω-3 endocannabinoids alters cannabinoid receptor activation,
generally producing CB2-preferring metabolites similar to AEA
and 2-AG (22, 26).
The Endocannabinoid Epoxides 17,18-EEQ-EA and 19,20-EDP-EA Are
Regulators of Platelet Function. The CYP-mediated epoxygenation
of AA produces EETs that are endothelial-derived hyperpolarizing
factors (EDHF) that inhibit platelet aggregation and adhesion to
endothelial cells (44). Correspondingly, 17,18-EEQ and 19,20-EDP
metabolites also inhibit platelet aggregation with IC50 values
comparable to those of 14,15-EET (45). Thus we hypothesized that
the EEQ-EA and EDP-EA metabolites modulate platelet func-
tion. Using washed human platelets, we show that 17,18-EEQ-EA
inhibits AA-induced platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 5A) (46). These inhibitory effects were not ob-
served in thrombin-, PAR4-AP–, collagen-, or U46619-induced
platelet aggregation (SI Appendix, Fig. S6). Additionally, no sig-
nificant inhibition of platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma
(PRP) was observed when ADP, collagen, or ristocetin was
used to induce aggregation (SI Appendix, Fig. S7). Thus, the
anti-platelet aggregatory properties of 17,18-EEQ-EA appear
to inhibit the AA-induced platelet aggregation specifically.
Conversely, 19,20-EDP-EA did not inhibit AA-induced platelet
aggregation. Rather a dose-dependent increase in aggregation un-
der stirring conditions, in the absence of any agonist, was observed
consistently (Fig. 5B). Because the 19,20-EDP metabolite mediates
antiplatelet aggregatory properties, there was a deviation in the
behavior of 19,20-EDP-EA, suggesting that the addition of the
ethanolamide motif to 19,20-EDP is responsible for the observed
proaggregatory effects.
17,18-EEQ-EA and 19,20-EDP-EA Mediate Coronary Artery Vasodilation.
CYP epoxygenases convert the ω-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA into
their corresponding epoxides that are vasodilatory in nature (34,
47). These epoxide metabolites are thought to be largely re-
sponsible for the observed antihypertensive effects of ω-3 fatty
acids (48). Therefore, we compared the vasodilatory effects of
17,18-EEQ-EA and 19,20-EDP-EA with those of the 17,18-EEQ
and 19,20-EDP parent compounds by using isometric tension
measurements to monitor their ability to relax bovine coronary
arteries preconstricted with U-44619. As shown in Fig. 5 C and D,
both 17,18-EEQ-EA and 19,20-EDP-EA dose-dependently relaxed
constricted bovine coronary arteries. However, the ED50 values
were approximately twofold greater than those of 17,18-EEQ and
19,20-EDP. Thus, the endocannabinoid epoxides were vasodilatory
in nature, albeit with reduced potency relative to their epoxide
parent compounds.
17,18-EEQ-EA and 19,20-EDP-EA Inhibit Angiogenesis in Dermal
HMVECs. Angiogenesis plays many roles both in normal homeo-
static functions and in many pathological disease states. Accu-
mulating evidence suggests that consumption of ω-3 fatty acids
inhibits angiogenesis in cancer (47). Similarly, endocannabinoids
are recognized for their ability to inhibit cancer, in part through
their antiangiogenic properties (49, 50). To determine if the EEQ-
EAs and EDP-EAs demonstrate a greater, similar, or diminished
ability to inhibit angiogenesis, we performed a Matrigel tubulo-
genesis assay using HMVECs and proangiogenic VEGF, as pre-
viously described (51). As shown in Fig. 5E, 17,18-EEQ-EA at
1 and 3 μM dose-dependently inhibited VEGF-mediated tubulo-
genesis with a decrease of tubulogenesis surface area of 18 and
46%, respectively. Parallel studies were used for 17,18-EEQ, which
produced similar, albeit slightly less potent, results with average
decreases of 9 and 28% at doses of 1 and 3 μM, respectively.
Identical conditions were used to screen 19,20-EDP-EA at 1 and
3 μM; tubulogenesis surface area was decreased by 31 and 75%,
respectively. Following a similar but less potent trend, 19,20-EDP
at 1 and 3 μM decreased tubulogenesis by 25 and 61%, respec-
tively. Previously, the antiangiogenic actions of the EDP metabo-
lites were shown to be mediated through potent inhibition of
VEGF-stimulated cell migration via an as yet unidentified ω-3
epoxyeicosanoid pathway (20).

In whole human blood, 17,18-EEQ-EA dose-dependently inhibited AA-induced platelet aggregation (n = 4) (A), whereas 19,20-EDP-EA induced platelet
aggregation (B) under stirring conditions in the absence of a platelet agonist (n = 7). (C and D) Dose-dependent relaxation of bovine coronary arteries
preconstricted with U-46619 (40 nM) was measured for 17,18-EEQ-EA and 17,18-EEQ (C) and for 19,20-EDP and 19,20-EDP-EA (D) to calculate the ED50.
(E) 17,18-EEQ-EA and 19,20-EDP-EA were assessed for their ability to inhibit VEGF-promoted angiogenesis in HMVECs plated on Matrigel (n =7). Compounds

 Discussion
Dysregulated inflammation is a common feature in most human
diseases, including several neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular
diseases. Lipid mediators play a central role in the regulation of in-
flammation (52). Therefore, the identification of anti-inflammatory
lipid mediators with unique signaling properties is critical for the
development of new therapeutics targeting inflammatory disease.
In particular, lipid mediators from the epoxyeicosanoid and
endocannabinoid pathways are attractive targets for therapeutic
intervention. Epoxyeicosanoid EETs are generated from AA by
CYP epoxygenases (41) and have recently been demonstrated to
exert potent anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo (53).
Notably, stable EET analogs have been developed for the treat-
ment of cardiovascular disease and inflammation via interac-
tion with the putative EET receptor (54). Endocannabinoids also
have been shown to contain anti-inflammatory and anticancer
properties. Drugs targeting the endocannabinoid-degrading en-
zymes such as FAAH are in clinical development to prolong
endocannabinoid half-life for the treatment of a wide range of dis-
eases (55). In this study, we report the discovery of anti-inflammatory
and vasoactive ω-3 endocannabinoid epoxides that are produced by
CYP epoxygenases. These molecules share structural similarity with
both their endocannabinoid and epoxide parent compounds and
have the ability to exert physiological effects through cross-talk
between the endocannabinoid and epoxide signaling pathways.
Studies to establish the biosynthetic routes revealed that the
ω-3 endocannabinoids EPEA and DHEA are converted by CYP
epoxygenases to generate a class of bioactive lipids, EEQ-EAs and
EDP-EAs. In the rat brain, both classes of these mediators were
found at levels comparable to those of similar related compounds
such as 14,15-EET, AEA, and DHEA. Additionally, cell-culture
studies established that both EPEA and DHEA are direct sub-
strates for CYP enzymes in LPS-activated BV-2 microglia, be-
cause the epoxygenation was diminished through inhibition of the
CYP2, CYP3, and CYP4 families (Fig. 2 D and E) when activated
microglia cells were preincubated with ketoconazole (0.5 μM).
To translate these results to the biosynthetic pathway in hu-
mans, we studied the metabolism of DHEA and EPEA with
CYP2J2 (the major epoxygenase in human brain and heart) and
found that EPEA and DHEA are epoxygenated at comparable
rates, albeit with a different regioselectivity (Fig. 3D). The total
turnover rates of AEA, EPEA, and DHEA are significantly
greater than those of AA, EPA, and DHA (28, 32, 56). Specif-
ically, maximal CYP2J2 conversion of DHA to 19,20-EDP was
calculated at 22.5 pmol·min−1·pmol−1 protein (57), whereas the
CYP2J2 conversion of DHEA to 19,20-EDP-EA was 542.3 ±
44.6 5 pmol·min−1·pmol−1 protein, thus demonstrating that the
preference for the DHEA substrate is an order of magnitude
greater than the preference for DHA. This finding implies that
DHEA and EPEA are likely the preferred substrates of CYP2J2
under inflammatory conditions, when CYP and substrate levels
both are increased.
Both the epoxides and endocannabinoids are known to exert
anti-inflammatory effects in a wide range of tissues, including the
brain (8, 38). The spontaneous production of EEQ-EA and EDP-
EA regioisomers by LPS-stimulated microglial cells suggested that
these metabolites have a role in inflammation (SI Appendix, Table
ST2). We show here (Fig. 4 A and B) that both 17,18-EEQ-EA
and 19,20-EDP-EA dose-dependently inhibit the production
of two prototypic proinflammatory biomarkers, IL-6 and NO,
while increasing the production of the anti-inflammatory cy-
tokine IL-10. The change in the cytokine expression levels indicates
that these metabolites likely switch microglia states from the
proinflammatory phenotype to the repair anti-inflammatory phe-
notype. Importantly, the direct comparison of the anti-inflammatory
properties of EDP-EA and EEQ-EA with those of their respective
EEQ and EDP parent compounds demonstrated that the ω-3
endocannabinoid epoxides have enhanced anti-inflammatory pro-
perties, most likely because of their interaction with CB2 and with
unknown epoxide receptors (Fig. 4E and SI Appendix, Fig. S12).
This notion is consistent with recent studies demonstrating that both
CB2 ligands and EETs promote the anti-inflammatory macrophage
phenotype (58, 59). In this study, the anti-inflammatory effects
of the ω-3 endocannabinoid epoxides were partially blocked by
AM630 (a CB2 inhibitor), GW99662 (a PPARγ inhibitor) (Fig. 4 C
and D), and pertussis toxin (PTX) (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 C and D),
suggesting the activation of multiple anti-inflammatory pathways.
Because CB2 is involved in the anti-inflammatory activity of the
endocannabinoid epoxides, we used the PRESTO-Tango β-arrestin
recruitment assay to demonstrate that the epoxygenation of
EPEA and DHEA converts weak CB1/CB2 agonists to partial
CB2 agonists (SI Appendix, Fig. S12). Interestingly, 19,20- and
16,17-EDP-EA were shown to be preferential CB2 agonists with
CB2:CB1 activation ratios of three- and fourfold, respectively.
Additionally, to gauge the potency at which these compounds act
on CB1 and CB2, full functional dose-response studies were
performed for AEA, 2-AG (Fig. 4G), DHEA, 19,20-EDP-EA
(Fig. 4F), EPEA, and 17,18-EEQ-EA (Fig. 4E). The calculated
EC50 values demonstrated that the CYP-mediated epoxygenation
of ω-6 and ω-3 endocannabinoids changes CB receptor activation,
generally producing CB2-preferring metabolites. It is important to
note that EPEA and DHEA are converted rapidly to other anti-
inflammatory CB2-preferring metabolites in addition to epoxides
that can interfere with the CB receptor-activation studies (19).
Collectively, these separate studies establish that the CYP-mediated
epoxygenation of endocannabinoids such as AEA, 2-AG (22, 26),
DHEA, and EPEA produces epoxide metabolites that preferen-
tially target CB2, thereby regulating inflammatory pathologies.
EETs play an important role in neuro-glio–vascular coupling
(38). Similar to EETs, EEQs and EDPs are involved in vasodi-
lation and in the inhibition of platelet aggregation; unlike EETs,
they inhibit angiogenesis. Thus, we focused further on the ac-
tions of 17,18-EEQ-EA and 19,20-EDP-EA in the vasculature.
The inhibition of platelet aggregation by 17,18-EEQ-EA (Fig.
5A) is consistent with what is known about the 17,18-EEQ parent
compound and other related epoxides. Specifically, EETs, EEQs,
and EDPs inhibit platelet aggregation and reduce thrombocyte
adhesion (60). Surprisingly, in our studies 19,20-EDP-EA pro-
moted platelet clotting under stirring conditions (Fig. 5B). Because
19,20-EDP, 19,20-DHETE, and DHA are antiaggregatory medi-
ators, our findings reveal a potentially important structure–activity
relationship among these lipids. Moreover, our findings afford
evidence of a proplatelet aggregatory mechanism of an ω-3–derived
metabolite; this mechanism should be taken into consideration
when weighing the potential benefits of DHA supplementation.
The physiological relevance of the ω-3 endocannabinoid epox-
ides is gleaned from the finding that they are bifunctional and are
produced by the cross-talk of two important anti-inflammatory
pathways—the CYP epoxygenase and endocannabinoid path-
ways. Although these metabolites exhibit the classical epox-
yeicosanoid and endocannabinoid activities, their bifunctional
nature imparts the ability to affect multiple signaling pathways
(CB2 and PPARγ) to resolve inflammation with higher potency
than their parent lipid metabolites (SI Appendix, Figs. S10 and
S11). Thus, our results suggest they play an important role in
inflammation within the larger context of the epoxyeicosanoid
and endocannabinoid lipidomes. Importantly, they are pro-
duced at a faster rate by the CYP enzymes and are found in
concentrations comparable to those of related lipid mediators.
In summary, our findings represent an initial step in evaluating
CYP epoxygenase-derived ω-3 endocannabinoid epoxides that,
by virtue of their biological properties, can serve as potential
therapeutic targets for diseases such as neuroinflammation and
cerebrovascular disorders.

 Experimental Procedures
Additional details of materials and experimental protocols used are given in
SI Appendix, Materials and Methods.
Chemical Synthesis of EEQ-EA and EDP-EA Regioisomers. EEQ-EA and EDP-EA
chemical synthesis was performed using a two-step synthesis. For non-
specific epoxygenation reactions, 10 mg of either EPA or DHA was dissolved in
2 mL of dichloromethane (DCM) with 2 molar equivalents of meta-
chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA) and was reacted for 1 h at room tem-
perature. The reaction was stopped with an equal volume of 10% aqueous
NaHCO3 to remove mCPBA from the organic layer, and the aqueous layer
was reextracted with equal (3×) volumes of DCM and was dried under
vacuum. Purification was achieved using normal-phase HPLC (NP-HPLC) us-
ing a Zorbax-NH2 5 μm × 9.4 mm × 250 mm semipreparative column (Agilent,
PN880952-208) with an isocratic gradient (hexane/isopropanol/acetic acid;
90:10:0.1) coupled to a HPLC system (SI Appendix, Fig. S8 A and B). For
coeluting regioisomers of DHA epoxides (19,20-EDP and 13,14-EDP) and EPA
epoxides (17,18-EEQ and 11,12-EEQ), the mixtures were further purified on
the same system using reversed-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC), a Sun Fire Prep C18
5 μm × 19 mm × 50 mm column (PN 186002566; Waters), and a mobile
system composed of solvent A (H2O/acetonitrile/acetic acid, 95:5:0.1), solvent
B (H2O/acetonitrile/acetic acid, 5:95:0.1), and a linear gradient from 50% A
to 0% A in 50 min (SI Appendix, Fig. S8 C and D) show similar profile. The
synthesis of 17,18-EEQ, 14,15-EEQ, 11,12-EEQ, 8,9-EEQ, 5,6-EEQ, 19,20-EDP,
and 16,17-EDP was confirmed by comparing retention times relative to
authentic standards purchased from Cayman Chemical and high-resolution
mass spectrometry.
In the second step, the coupling of each respective EEQ or EDP regioisomer to
ethanolamine was achieved by dissolving the epoxide/1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyla-
minopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC)/N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)/ethanolamine in
acetonitrile in a 1:10:10:10 ratio with rocking at room temperature for 16 h.
Last, the resulting EEQ-EA and EDP-EA regioisomers were purified by RP-HPLC
using a Sun Fire Prep C18 5 μm × 19 mm × 50 mm column (PN 186002566;
Waters). Purity and retention times were assessed using bioanalytical RP-HPLC,
and successful synthesis was confirmed by high-resolution mass spectroscopy
and proton NMR (SI Appendix, Fig. S9 A and B).
Expression and Purification of CPR. CPR from Rattus norvegicus was expressed
and purified as previously described (61).
LC-MS/MS Analysis. Samples were analyzed with the 5500 QTRAP LC/MS/MS
system (AB Sciex) in the Metabolomics Laboratory of the Roy J. Carver Bio-
technology Center, University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. Analyst
1.6.2 software (AB Sciex) was used for data acquisition and analysis. The
1200 series HPLC system (Agilent Technologies) includes a degasser, an auto-
sampler, and a binary pump. The LC separation was performed on an Agilent
Eclipse XDB-C18 (4.6 mm × 150 mm × 5 μm) with mobile phase A (0.1% formic
acid in water) and mobile phase B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile). The flow
rate was 0.4 mL/min. The linear gradient was as follows: 0–2 min, 90% A;
8 min, 55% A; 13–25 min, 40% A; 30 min, 30% A; 35 min, 25% A; 40–47 min,
20% A; 47.5–54 min, 90% A. The autosampler was set at 5 °C. The injection
volume was 10 μL. Positive mass spectra were acquired with the ion spray
voltage of 5,500 V under ESI. The source temperature was 450 °C. The
curtain gas, ion source gas 1, and ion source gas 2 were 32, 60, and 60 psi,
respectively. MRM was used for quantitation: 19,20-EDP-EA and 7,8-EDP-EA,
m/z 388.1 → m/z 62.1; 16,17-EDP-EA, 13,14-EDP-EA, and 10,11-EDP-EA, m/z
388.1 → m/z 370.1; 17/18-EEQ-EA, 14/15-EEQ-EA, and 11/12-EEQ-EA, m/z 362.1 →
m/z 344.1; 8/9-EEQ-EA, m/z 362.1 → m/z 62.0; 5/6-EEQ-EA, m/z 362.1 → m/z 91.0;
EPEA, 346.3 → m/z 62.1; DHEA, 372.4 → m/z 62.1; and anandamide, m/z 348.3 →
m/z 62.1. Internal standards were monitored at m/z 350.3 → m/z 66.1 for
EPEA-d4, at m/z 376.4 → m/z 66.1 for DHEA-d4, at m/z 352.3 → m/z 66.1 for
anadamide-d4, and at m/z 372.1 → m/z 354.1 for 14/15-EET-EA-d8.
LC-MS/MS Method for Quantitation of 17,18-DiHETE-EA and 19,20-DiHDPA-EA.
Samples were analyzed with the 5500 QTRAP LC/MS/MS system (AB Sciex) in
the Metabolomics Laboratory of the Roy J. Carver Biotechnology Center,
University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. Analyst 1.6.2 software was used
for data acquisition and analysis. The 1200 series HPLC system (Agilent
Technologies) includes a degasser, an autosampler, and a binary pump. The
LC separation was performed on an Agilent Eclipse XDB-C18 (4.6 mm ×
150 mm × 5 μm) with mobile phase A (0.1% formic acid in water) and mobile
phase B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile). The flow rate was 0.4 mL/min. The
linear gradient was as follows: 0–2 min, 90% A; 8 min, 60% A; 15–22 min,
40% A; 23–29 min, 90% A. The autosampler was set at 10 °C. The injection
volume was 1 μL. Positive mass spectra were acquired with the ion spray
voltage of 5,000 V under ESI. The source temperature was 450 °C. The cur-
tain gas, ion source gas 1, and ion source gas 2 were 32, 60, and 55 psi,
respectively. MRM was used for quantitation: 19,20-DHDPA-EA, m/z
406.3→m/z 370.3; 17,18-DHETE-EA, m/z 380.3→m/z 344.3. Internal stan-
dard 14,15-DHET-EA was monitored at m/z 382.3→ m/z 346.3.
Extraction of AEA, EPEA, DHEA, EEQ-EA, and EDP-EAs from Rat Tissue. The tissue
extractions of AEA, DHEA, EPEA, EEQ-EAs, and EDP-EAs were performed
similarly as previously reported for the quantitative analysis of the endo-
cannabinoids (27, 62). Sprague–Dawley rats were killed, and whole organs
were immediately dissected, pooled (n = 3 per pool), weighed, and mechan-
ically homogenized on ice with a BioHomogenizer (BioSpec) in a 1:1 ratio with
PBS supplemented with 12-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido)-dodecanoic acid (AUDA)
(Cayman Chemical) (30 μm) and PMSF (1 mM) until a homogenous slurry was
formed. The equivalent of 1 g of each tissue was homogenized in 40 mL of
ethyl acetate/hexane (9:1) with a BioHomogenizer (BioSpec) at room tem-
perature and then was sonicated for 1 min. The resulting solution was washed
with a 30% volume of water and centrifuged for layer separation. The organic
layer was removed, and the aqueous layer was extracted twice with an equal
volume of ethyl acetate/hexane (9:1). The pooled organic supernatant was
removed using a Buchi 120 rotary evaporator and was reconstituted in 1 mL of
chloroform. The metabolites of interest were isolated by solid-phase extrac-
tion (SPE) using a 1-mL silica gel column (no. 214477; Sigma). The reconstituted
samples were added to the preconditioned silica column, washed in three
column volumes of chloroform, and then eluted with four column volumes of
methanol/chloroform (1:9). The eluent was dried, and samples were recon-
stituted in ethanol for analysis via LC-MS-MS.
To validate the method, the metabolite extraction linearity was examined
for each class of lipids from homogenized rat brain tissue. The metabolites
17,18-EEQ-EA, 19,20-EDP-EA, DHEA, EPEA, and AEA were spiked at 20, 60,
and 300 ng into homogenized rat brain tissue and extracted as described
above. The average percent recovery was calculated by subtracting a non-
spiked sample of each metabolite for comparison with authentic standards at
low, middle, and high levels on the standard curve. Extraction linearities for
20, 60, and 300 ng of all metabolites (17,18-EEQ-EA, 19,20-EDP-EA, DHEA,
EPEA, and AEA) were similar among lipids with average percent recoveries of
89.1 ± 3.1, 84.8 ± 2.8, and 71.5 ± 4.5%, respectively.
Whole-Cell Metabolism Assays. BV-2 microglial cells were seeded in six-well
dishes (5 × 105 cells per well) and grown to 90% confluence in DMEM
(Gibco), 10% FBS (Gibco), penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/mL)
at 37 °C and 5% CO2. At the time of the experiment the supernatant was
replaced with serum-free medium, and cells were activated with 100 ng/mL of
LPS for 12 h. In one set of experiments the supernatant and cells were col-
lected at 1, 4, and 12 h after LPS stimulation and were examined for the
natural production of target lipid mediators. Alternatively, after the 12-h LPS
activation, cells were incubated with either EPEA (20 μM) or DHEA (20 μM) in
serum-free medium for 30 min. The general P450 inhibitor ketoconazole
(0.5 μM) was added in some experiments to inhibit the CYP3A, CYP2C, and
CYP2J families. Controls lacking LPS stimulation were run in parallel with the
experiment. After the appropriate time period, cells were scraped, and the su-
pernatant was collected and subjected to three rapid freeze–thaw cycles using
liquid N2 and a warm water bath (37 °C) for cell lysis. The supernatant and cells
were extracted three times with four volumes of ethyl acetate/hexane (9:1).
Incubations of EPEA and DHEA with Brain Microsomes. Microsomes derived
from mouse tissues were prepared using previously described differential
centrifugation methods (28). Tissues were dissected from Sprague–Dawley
rats, weighed, homogenized, and diluted to 20% (wt/vol) using a buffer
containing 250 mM sucrose, 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mM PMSF, and a
protease inhibitor mixture for mammalian tissue extraction (no. 25955-11;
Nacalai Tesque, Inc.). A series of low (3,000 × g) and medium (10,000 × g)
centrifugation speeds was used to remove cellular debris and nuclear and
mitochondrial fractions. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at
100,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C to pellet the endoplasmic reticulum containing
CYPs. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mM DTT,
1 mM EDTA, and 20% glycerol with a Teflon homogenizer. Microsomal
protein content was measured using a BCA assay kit (product no. 23233;
Thermo Fisher Scientific). Incubations with microsomes were performed at a
protein concentration of 1 mg/mL with saturating concentrations of DHEA
and EPEA as described in Fig. 3 A–C. Next microsome incubations were
extracted using three volumes of ethyl acetate/hexane (9:1), the organic
layer was collected and the aqueous layer was reextracted twice more. The

 organic layer was dried under vacuum and was reconstituted in ice-cold
ethanol for LC-MS/MS analysis.
CYP2J2 Nanodisc Kinetic Metabolism of EPEA and DHEA. Human CYP2J2 was
heterologously expressed and incorporated into the lipid bilayers of nano-
discs as previously described (61). Incubation mixtures contained CYP2J2
nanodiscs (0.2 μM), CPR (0.6 μM), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) (0.1%),
and incremental increases of either EPEA or DHEA (500 μL total volume) in
100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Samples were equilibrated at 37 °C for
5 min before the reaction was initiated with the addition of 0.5 mM NADPH.
Reactions were stopped after 15 min and were extracted three times with
1 mL of ethyl acetate. The organic layer was dried and reconstituted in ice-
cold ethanol for LC-MS/MS analysis.
Kinetic Analysis of 17,18-EEQ-EA and 19,20-EDP-EA Hydrolysis by sEH. LC-MS/MS
was performed to quantitate the conversion of the terminal epoxides to their
vicinal diols using LC-MS/MS. Enzymatic linearity over a 10-min period was
confirmed. Enzyme kinetics were estimated using incremental increases of
substrate for the generation of kinetic curves that were fit to the Michaelis–
Menten equation for calculation of Vmax and Km. Incubations were per-
formed with recombinant sEH ([E]final = 6 nM) in NaPO4 (100 mM, pH 7.4),
BSA (0.1 mg/mL), and substrate (17,18-EEQ-EA or 19,20-EDP-EA) at 37 °C.
After 5 min the reaction was stopped with methanol supplemented with
AUDA (0.5 μM), and the solution was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to
pellet protein. The supernatant was collected and analyzed via LC-MS/MS.
Microglial Neuroinflammation Studies. BV-2 microglial cells were plated in 24-
well dishes (2 × 105 cells per well) and were grown to 80–90% confluence in
DMEM (Gibco), 10% FBS (Gibco), penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin
(0.1 mg/mL) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. At the time of the experiment, the medium
was replaced with serum-free medium, and the cells were pretreated with
19,20-EDP-EA for 4 h before stimulation with 25 ng/mL LPS (Sigma-Aldrich).
Medium was collected at 24 h, and NO production was determined by eval-
uating the nitrite (NO2
−) content of the medium using the Griess method.
Collected medium (80 μL) was mixed with Griess reagent A (no. 780018;
Cayman Chemical) and Griess reagent B (no.780020; Cayman Chemical), and
the absorbance at 490 nm was used to quantify NO2
− production using a
standard curve. Medium supernatant was also examined for the production
of IL-6 (no. 583371; Cayman Chemical) and IL-10 (no. 88-7105-22; Affymetrix
eBioscience) cytokines. Compound cytotoxicity was assessed by measuring
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in the medium using a commercially
available kit (no. 601170; Cayman Chemical).
Platelet Aggregation Studies. The University of Michigan Review Board ap-
proved studies, and written informed consent was obtained from all par-
ticipants before blood collection. Human whole blood was drawn from the
antecubital vein of healthy donors. PRP was obtained from whole blood by
centrifugation at 200 × g for 10 min. Platelets were pelleted from PRP in the
presence of acid citrate dextrose (ACD) (2.5%) and apyrase (0.02 U/mL) by cen-
trifugation at 2,000 × g for 10 min and then were resuspended in Tyrode’s buffer
(12 mM NaHCO3, 127 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.5 mM NaH2PO4, 1 mM MgCl2,
5 mM glucose, 10 mM Hepes) to a final concentration of 3.0 × 108 platelets/
mL. Changes in light transmission were recorded by an eight-channel
platelet aggregometer (Chrono-Log) with stirring at 1,200 rpm at 37 °C.
Washed human platelets were incubated with 12.5, 25, and 50 μM 17,18-
EEQ-EA for 5 min, and platelet aggregation was induced by 5 μM AA,
thrombin (1 nM), PAR4-AP (50 μM), collagen (2 mg/mL), and U46619 (1 μM).
DMSO and 14,15-EET were used as controls. No platelet agonists were added for
the tests of 19,20-EDP-EA in washed platelets. Experiments with PRP were ad-
justed to 3.0 × 108 platelets/mL using platelet poor plasma (PPP) from same
donor. PRP was incubated with 12.5, 25, and 50 μM 17,18-EEQ EA for 5 min, and
platelet aggregation was induced by ADP (1 μM), collagen (2 μg/mL), or ristocetin
(1 mg/mL).
Bovine Coronary Artery Vasodilation Assay. Fresh bovine hearts were procured
on ice from the local butcher. The left anterior coronary artery was dissected
from the adjacent connective tissue and cut into 2-mm ring sections. The
artery lumen then was mounted on two parallel pins attached to a piezo-
electric transducer for isometric tension measurements using a Myograph
Tissue Bath System (DMT) as previously described (63). Basal tension (100%
relaxation) was set at 30 mN, and tissues were equilibrated in Krebs buffer
(130 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.18 mM KH2PO4, 1.17 mM MgSO4, 14.9 mM
NaHCO3, 5.5 mM dextrose, 0.026 mM EDTA, 1.6 mM CaCl2) for 1 h. Maximal
contractions were determined by washing tissues with Krebs buffer sup-
plemented with 60 mM KCl for 3 min, and then tissues were washed with
Krebs buffer to return to basal tension. This step was repeated until con-
sistent contractile measurements were achieved. The thromboxane receptor
agonist U46619 (20–40 nM) was used to constrict the rings to ∼40–80% of
maximal contraction (0% relaxation). Cumulative additions of EEQ, EDP,
EEQ-EA, and EDP-EA (1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM, 1 μM, and 10 μM, respectively)
were added to each chamber, and the resulting percent relaxation was
plotted against the corresponding substrate dose.
Inhibition of Human Microvascular Cell Tube Formation. The EEQ, EEQ-EA, EDP,
and EDP-EA inhibition of VEGF-promoted tube formation was assessed in
HMVECs (Cell Systems) as previously described (51). Briefly, 35 μL of Matrigel
was plated on the bottom of a 48-well plate and allowed to gel for 30 min at
37 °C. Approximately 15,000 HMVECs then were seeded per well in EBM-
2 medium (Lonza) supplemented with VEGF at 50% of the concentration
used in EGM-2. After the compounds were added at the desired concen-
tration, tube formation by HMVECs was quantified after 8 h. Cells were
imaged using a Cannon Rebel digital single lens reflex camera, and the tube
area was quantified using ImageJ.
Statistics. Results are presented as average ± SE unless noted otherwise.
Kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear regression of the Michaelis–
Menten equation using OriginPro 8.6 software (OriginLab). Data were ana-
lyzed for statistical significance using a two-sided Student’s t test where
*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001.
