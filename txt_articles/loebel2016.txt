Infection-triggered disease onset, chronic immune activation and autonomic dysregulation in CFS point
to an autoimmune disease directed against neurotransmitter receptors. Autoantibodies against G-protein
coupled receptors were shown to play a pathogenic role in several autoimmune diseases. Here, serum
samples from a patient cohort from Berlin (n = 268) and from Bergen with pre- and post-treatment
samples from 25 patients treated within the KTS-2 rituximab trial were analysed for IgG against human
a and b adrenergic, muscarinic (M) 1–5 acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin, angiotensin, and endothelin
receptors by ELISA and compared to a healthy control cohort (n = 108). Antibodies against b2, M3 and M4
receptors were significantly elevated in CFS patients compared to controls. In contrast, levels of antibod-
ies against a adrenergic, dopamine, serotonin, angiotensin, and endothelin receptors were not different
between patients and controls. A high correlation was found between levels of autoantibodies and ele-
vated IgG1–3 subclasses, but not with IgG4. Further patients with high b2 antibodies had significantly
more frequently activated HLA-DR+ T cells and more frequently thyreoperoxidase and anti-nuclear
antibodies. In patients receiving rituximab maintenance treatment achieving prolonged B-cell depletion,
elevated b2 and M4 receptor autoantibodies significantly declined in clinical responder, but not in
non-responder. We provide evidence that 29.5% of patients with CFS had elevated antibodies against
one or more M acetylcholine and b adrenergic receptors which are potential biomarkers for response
to B-cell depleting therapy. The association of autoantibodies with immune markers suggests that they
activate B and T cells expressing b adrenergic and M acetylcholine receptors. Dysregulation of
acetylcholine and adrenergic signalling could also explain various clinical symptoms of CFS.

1. Introduction
With an estimated prevalence of 0.2–0.3% Chronic Fatigue Syn-
drome (CFS) is a frequent and severe chronic disease. Patients suf-
fer from persistent exhaustion, cognitive dysfunctions, pain and
flu-like symptoms, leading to a substantial reduction of life quality
(Carruthers et al., 2011). A hallmark of CFS is delayed aggravation
of symptoms by exertion. There is ample evidence of dysregulation
of the autonomic sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous sys-
tem, including vasomotor and gastrointestinal dysfunction, and
increased sensitivity to pain and sensory stimuli (Felten et al.,
1985; Freeman and Komaroff, 1997; Gur and Oktayoglu, 2008).
In the majority of patients CFS onset is triggered by an infection
with EBV or other intracellular pathogens (Faulkner and Smith,
2008). Persistent immune dysregulation with elevated or dimin-
ished antibody levels, T cell activation and diminished NK cell

 function were shown in many studies (Brenu et al., 2011; Klimas
et al., 1990; Loebel et al., 2015; Ogawa et al., 1998; Skowera
et al., 2004). In a recent study we had analysed 468 CFS patients
and 25% had decreased serum levels of immunoglobulin mostly
of IgG3 subclass, while elevated immunoglobulin levels with an
excess of IgM and IgG2 in particular were found in another 25%
(Loebel et al., 2015) and unpublished data. Further, the presence
of
autoantibodies
was
discussed
in
several
small
studies
(Konstantinov et al., 1996; Onouchi et al., 1999; Tanaka et al.,
2003; von Mikecz et al., 1997; Wheatland, 2005; Yamamoto
et al., 2012). Autoantibodies against the M1 acetylcholine receptor
(AChR) were shown in CFS patients and were associated with
reduced binding of a M AChR ligand in brain detected by PET
(Tanaka et al., 2003; Yamamoto et al., 2012). Recently, autoanti-
bodies against b1 and
b2 adrenergic receptors (AdR) were
described in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)
and in patients with orthostatic hypotension (Li et al., 2014,
2015; Yu et al., 2012). This finding is of relevance for CFS, as an
estimated subgroup of 10–20% of CFS patients concurrently suffers
from POTS (Hoad et al., 2008; Jones et al., 2005; Reynolds et al.,
2014). First evidence for a pathogenic role of autoantibodies in
CFS comes from two clinical trials with the monoclonal anti-
CD20 antibody rituximab (Fluge et al., 2011, 2015). Upon depletion
of CD20+ B cells with rituximab approximately 60% of patients
experience a partial or complete, and in some patients sustained
clinical remission. The delayed onset of response with a median
of approximately 5 months in both trials suggests that clinical
effects are not mediated by direct depletion of CD20+ B cells, but
by the short-lived antibody-producing plasma cells arising from
CD20+ memory B cells, followed by subsequent wash-out of
autoantibodies.
In the present study we analysed a total of 293 CFS patients for
serum antibodies against various G-protein coupled receptors
(GPCRs) including adrenergic, M acetylcholine, dopamine, and
serotonin receptors and correlated their levels with parameters
of immune dysregulation and response to rituximab.
2. Patients and methods
2.1. Human blood samples
Patients were diagnosed at the Charité outpatient clinic for
immunodeficiencies at the Institute for Medical Immunology at
the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin between 2011 and 2014.
Diagnosis of CFS was based on Canadian Criteria (Carruthers
et al., 2003) and exclusion of other medical or neurological diseases
which may cause fatigue. Patients with systemic steroid or
immunosuppressant therapy or a diagnosis of primary immunode-
ficiency were excluded from this study. Controls were recruited
from staff and did not suffer from CFS. However, neither clinical
nor laboratory assessment was performed for controls. The study
was
approved by
the Ethics Committee of Charité Univer-
sitätsmedizin Berlin in accordance with the 1964 Declaration of
Helsinki and its later amendments. All patients and healthy con-
trols gave informed consent. Pre- and post-treatment samples from
CFS patients treated within the rituximab trial KTS-2 (Clinical
Trials:
NCT01156909)
were
provided
from
the
Haukeland
university Hospital, Bergen Norway (Fluge et al., 2015).
2.2. Quantification of autoantibodies by ELISA
Serum IgG against GPCRs were determined by ELISA by
CellTrend GmbH, Luckenwalde, Germany. Recombinant GPCR
proteins were expressed in CHO cells. Pre- and post-treatment
samples from the rituximab trial were analysed in the same assay
plate, and these samples were analysed blinded to group allocation
(CFS patients versus controls, responder versus non-responder,
pre- versus post-treatment).
2.3. Laboratory data
Serum C3c and immunoglobulins were determined at the
Charité routine diagnostics laboratory, Labor Berlin GmbH by
immunological turbidity test (Roche Diagnostics). IgG subclasses
were determined by Hitachi COMBI kit (The Binding Site). T cell
activation was measured by quantitation of HLA-DR expression
on human peripheral blood T cells by flow cytometric analysis
(Quantibryte, BD Bioscience). The following mouse anti-human
fluorescence-labelled monoclonal antibodies were used for quan-
tification of T cells and subsets: cluster of differentiation (CD)3
Allophycocyanine-Alexa Fluor 750 (APC-A750), CD8 APC, HLA-DR
Phycoerythrine (PE), CD45 Krome-Orange (KrO) (all from Beckman
Coulter). Stained samples were acquired on a ten-colour Navios
flow cytometer and analysed using Navios Software (Beckman
Coulter). Thyreoperoxidase/thyreoglobulin and ANA antibodies
were measured by immunofluorescence.
2.4. Statistical analysis
Statistical
data
analyses
were
done
using
the
software
GraphPad Prism 6.0. Nonparametric statistical methods were used.
Continuous variables were expressed as median and interquartile
range (IQR). Univariate comparisons of two independent groups
were done using the Mann–Whitney-U test. Contingency analysis
was done by Fisher’s exact test. Comparisons of two dependent
groups were done using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank
test.
Correlation
analysis
was
performed
by
nonparametric
Spearman coefficient r. A two-tailed p-value of <0.05 was consid-
ered statistically significant.
3. Results
Antibodies against various GPCRs were analysed in serum sam-
ples from 268 patients with CFS diagnosed at Charité. Detailed
information on the patients is given in Table 1. Control group
included 108 sex- and age matched healthy individuals from
Charité staff. We found significantly higher autoantibody levels
against M3 and M4 AChR and b2 AdR in CFS patients compared
to controls (Fig. 1A and B). Crossreactivity between all 5 M and
b1 and b2 AdR but also between M and b receptor was seen in a
substantial portion of CFS patients as shown for M4 in Fig. 1C.

 receptor (AT) did not reveal immunoreactivity neither in patient
nor control cohort. Fig. 1D shows data for AT, ET, D1, 5HT1A, and
a1 AdR.
We
observed
diminished
serum
levels
of
at
least
one
immunoglobulin class or subclass in a total of 27.1% of CFS patients
according to the reference range of the Charité diagnostic labora-
tory, and elevated serum levels in 20.9%, respectively. The most
prominent finding was a single or concomitant IgG3 (10.1%)
deficiency in CFS patients. Activated HLA-DR+ CD8+ T cells were
present in 14.3% of CFS patients. We therefore correlated levels
of M and b receptor antibodies with levels of IgM, IgG and IgG
subclasses. We observed a remarkably strong correlation of higher
autoantibodies for all M and b subtypes with higher IgG1–3 sub-
classes, but not IgG4 (r-values shown in Table 2). No association
of M and b autoantibodies with diminished immunoglobulins
was found. For comparative analysis we defined elevated b and
M receptor antibodies as above the 90th percentile of the control
group. The association of immunoglobulin levels with autoanti-
bodies is shown in Table 2 and illustrated for b2 AdR antibodies
in Fig. 2.
Based on this definition, we performed a comparative analysis
with T cell activation, diminished levels of complement C3c, and ele-
vated thyreoperoxidase (TPO)/thyreoglobulin (TG) and anti-nuclear
antibodies (ANA). Patients with high b2 antibodies had significantly
more frequently activated HLA-DR+ CD8+ T cells. There was also an
association between M1 and b2 antibodies and elevated TPO/TG and
ANA antibodies (Table 3). Both b1 and b2 (r = 0.81; Fig. 1C) and M1
and b2 (r = 0.71; not shown) showed a strong correlation.
We further correlated elevated receptor autoantibodies with
various clinical symptoms including disease severity, muscle pain,
susceptibility to infection and infection triggered disease onset.
The only association we observed was of M1 AChR antibodies with
dizziness (p = 0.05). Data on POTS was available in 8 patients only.
Of these 4 patients fulfilled the criteria for POTS and 4 did not.
Elevated b AdR antibodies were present only in two of the latter.
In the cohort of 25 CFS patients treated within the rituximab
trial KTS2 at the Haukeland University Hospital, autoantibodies
against receptors b1, b2, M1 and M4 were analysed in pre- and
post-treatment samples. Patient characteristics for Bergen patients
are reported elsewhere (Fluge et al., 2015). 15 patients had clini-
cally significant response and 10 patients were non-responder to
B-cell depletion therapy. In the KTS-2 study, Rituximab infusions
were pre-planned to be given at 0 and 2 weeks, then maintenance
at 3, 6, 10 and 15 months. According to the protocol, if there were
no signs of response at the 10-months clinical visit, rituximab infu-
sions at 10 and 15 months could be omitted. Also, according to an
approved amendment for the study, patients in slow and gradual
improvement after 12-months follow-up could receive further
rituximab infusions with prolonged B-cell depletion period. Among
10 non-responder, three patients received four infusions (last
at
6-months),
five
patients
received
five
infusions
(last
at
10-months), one patient received six infusions (last at 15-months),
and one patient with some improvement yet not a significant
clinical response received in total eight infusions (last at 22 months).
Among 15 clinical responder, 10 major responder received the
pre-planned six rituximab infusions, one major responder had five
infusions, and four moderate responder received additional infusions
(Fluge et al., 2015).
Elevated
antibody
levels
were
detected
in
pre-treatment
samples against b1, b2, M1 and M4 receptors in a subset of patients
(Fig. 3). Remarkably, elevated autoantibody levels had normalised
in the majority of clinical responder post-treatment. In responder
post-treatment levels for all four antibodies were significantly
lower compared to pre-treatment. In 10 responding patients
post-treatment samples analysed were from 24 months after initi-
ation of treatment and 9 months after the last rituximab infusion,
when B cells had partially normalised. Post-treatment samples
from the 10 non-responder were obtained at months 6–24. For
statistical analysis, two samples harvested at 6 months follow-up
were omitted, thus leaving serum samples harvested between
months 10 and 24, from 8 out of these 10 non-responder to be
included and compared to pre-treatment. In the samples from
non-responder there were significantly lower levels for b1 AdR
antibodies but no obvious difference between b2, M1 and M4
levels pre- and post-treatment. Total IgG, IgA and IgM levels
post-treatment were somewhat lower (mean 1.04, 0.28, and
0.27 g/l lower, respectively) as compared to pre-treatment levels,
but the reductions were not significantly different between
responder and non-responder (manuscript submitted).
4. Discussion
We found significantly elevated levels of antibodies against b2
AdR, M3 AChR and M4 AChR in a subset of patients with CFS. Some
controls had elevated antibodies as well. In contrast, no difference
between CFS patients and controls were found in antibody levels
neither against a AdR described in hypertension (Dandel et al.,
2013; Wallukat and Schimke, 2014) dopamine receptors found in
schizophrenia and movement disorders (Balint and Bhatia, 2013;
Dale et al., 2012; Steiner et al., 2015), serotonin receptors found
in antiphospholipid syndrome (Frauenknecht et al., 2013), nor

 against endothelin or angiotensin receptor as in systemic sclerosis
(Gunther et al., 2014), and thromboangiitis obliterans (Klein-
Weigel et al., 2014). A previous study from Japan reported serum
autoantibodies against the M1 AChR in 31 of 60 CFS patients
(Tanaka et al., 2003). In a more recent PET study, evidence of M
AChR autoantibody binding in the brain was provided by showing
that antibody-positive patients had reduced binding of a labelled
M AChR ligand as compared to antibody-negative CFS patients
and healthy controls (Yamamoto et al., 2012).
Autoantibodies against b AdR and M AChR have already been
described for more than two decades in cardiovascular and more
recently
in
various
autoimmune
and
neurological
diseases
(Wallukat and Schimke, 2014). b1 AdR and M2 AChR antibodies
were first described in patients with protozoa-induced Chagas
heart disease (Davila et al., 2008; Labovsky et al., 2007; Ribeiro
et al., 2010; Thiers et al., 2012). b AdR autoantibodies were further
shown
in
patients
with
dilated
cardiomyopathy,
orthostatic
hypotension, and POTS (Dandel et al., 2012; Li et al., 2014, 2015;
Wallukat and Schimke, 2014; Yu et al., 2012). Antibodies against
M AChR were described in autoimmune diseases including M1 in
Lambert Eaton (Suzuki, 2010), myasthenia gravis (Takamori et al.,
2007) and schizophrenia (Jones et al., 2014), and M1 and M3 in
Sjögren’s Syndrome (Schegg et al., 2008; Sumida et al., 2013),
and b1 and M2 in Graves’ disease (Galloway et al., 2014;
Stavrakis et al., 2009). These diseases share similarities with CFS
including
fatigue
and
autonomic
dysfunction.
A
study
in
schizophrenia showed binding of M1 antibody positive patients
IgG in brain tissue especially in hippocampus, but not in M1 nega-
tive patients (Jones et al., 2014). M1 AChR knockout mice have sev-
ere deficits in learning and memory (Gould et al., 2015). Similar to
our findings, in most other diseases autoantibodies are found in
only a subset of patients with a wide overlap of levels in patients
and controls.
Various studies analysed function and binding of antibodies
against b AdR and M AChR. In fact most studies on b AdR antibodies
in cardiovascular disease used a cardiomyocyte contraction assay
(Wallukat and Schimke, 2014). Autoantibodies against b1 AdR in
cardiomyopathy were shown to affect ligand binding and car-
diomyocyte function similar to agonists (Herda et al., 2012). How-
ever, the impact of b1 AdR antibodies on receptor function is quite
complex as antibody binding to different epitopes and heteroge-
neous effects on receptor traffic and activity including antagonist
effects were observed (Schulze et al., 2005; Turki and Liggett,
1995). In addition, non-functional antibodies were described
mostly in healthy individuals (Bornholz et al., 2014). Further stud-
ies suggest that conformational epitopes are recognised by b1 AdR
autoantibodies, requiring a three-dimensional receptor structure
to detect them, which is often not preserved when recombinant
protein or peptide-based assays were used (Bornholz et al.,
2013). Assays using living cells are, however, difficult to standard-
ise and not well suited for clinical diagnostics. In the present study
we used recombinant receptors as antigens which are stabilized to
maintain their conformation.
Further we observed more than half of the patients having anti-
bodies against more than one receptor of the respective family.
This is not surprising as there is a 40–70% sequence homology
within the five M AChR and within the two b AdR and an approx-
imately 30% overlap of b AdR and M4 AChR. Furthermore, the pres-
ence of both M AChR and b AdR autoantibodies is reported in other
diseases as well (Galloway et al., 2014; Pei et al., 2012; Stavrakis
et al., 2009; Talvani et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2006). Our correlation
studies suggest that the prime targets of antibody responses in CFS
are b2 and possibly M4 receptors. This, of course, does not exclude
other autoantibodies (not investigated in the present study) with
functional activity in CFS.
What are potential mechanisms leading to induction of b AdR
and M AChR antibodies in CFS patients? There is evidence that a
subset of patients experienced major distressing life events before
CFS onset and that CFS is frequently triggered by an infection. Thus
it is tempting to speculate that chronic adrenergic stimulation may
lead to conformational changes of receptors resulting in more
immunogenic epitopes and that infection-triggered immune acti-
vation induces the autoantibody response. It is also conceivable
that low level non-pathogenic b AdR and M AChR antibodies exert-
ing regulatory functions are already present in healthy subjects.
We do not know yet, what the significance and functional rele-
vance of b AdR and M AChR specific antibodies in CFS is. To get
some evidence we correlated autoantibody levels with disease
symptoms and other immunological alterations found in CFS.
Remarkably, we observed a significant correlation of levels of
Fig. 2. Immunoglobulin levels in CFS patients with and without elevated b2 AdR
antibodies. 268 CFS patients of the Berlin cohort were grouped as either antibody
positive or negative according to the 90th percentile of the healthy control group
and compared for IgM, IgG and IgG subclass levels. Statistics analysis of two
independent groups was performed by nonparametric Mann–Whitney U test with a
two-tailed p-value of ⁄p < 0.05, ⁄⁄p < 0.01, ⁄⁄⁄p < 0.01 and n.s. – not significant.

 b AdR and M AChR antibodies with immunoglobulin levels, T cell
activation, and elevated ANA and TPO antibodies. This fits well
with findings in other autoimmune diseases. Increased IgG, mostly
of IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses, but also IgG2 were reported in SLE,
Sjögrens Syndrome and primary biliary cirrhosis (Cakalaroski
et al., 2000; Lin and Li, 2009; Liu and Li, 2011; Zhang et al.,
2015; Zhao and Han, 2012). T cell activation is frequently present
in autoimmune disease, as well as elevated ANA titres and TPO
antibodies (Gilmour et al., 2000; Perilloux et al., 2000; Strioga
et al., 2011). Interestingly, b AdR and M AChR are expressed by
lymphocytes, too, regulating activation, migration, and antibody
production (Fujii et al., 2003; Grisanti et al., 2010). Thus a direct
effect of autoantibodies on the observed skewed immune parame-
ters is conceivable. The effect of adrenergic stimulation on immune
cells is complex depending on the activation status of the immune
cell and type of stimulant and both immune stimulation and sup-
pression were reported. Recent studies showed that while b2 AdR
agonists reduce IFN-c and IL-2 production in memory T cells, IL-1
and TNF production were enhanced (Slota et al., 2015; Zalli et al.,
2015). Further b2 AdR stimulation inhibited lymphocyte prolifera-
tion and resulted in lymphopenia by inhibiting egress from lymph
nodes (Nakai et al., 2014; Slota et al., 2015). In contrast agonistic b1
autoantibodies enhanced the proliferation of T lymphocytes (Du
et al., 2012). In monocytes b2-adrenergic stimulation has inhibi-
tory effects on LPS-induced monocyte TNF production. Interest-
ingly, this inhibitory effect was less in CFS patients compared to
healthy controls (Kavelaars et al., 2000). Further, enhanced produc-
tion of IgG1 upon b2 AdR stimulation of B cells was shown (Podojil

 and Sanders, 2003). Thus, the association of autoantibodies with
enhanced IgG levels we observed suggests agonistic effects of b2
AdR antibodies on B cell receptors. In vitro functional assays in
CFS patients are required to clarify the direct effect of these
autoantibodies on immune cell function. Also, autoantibodies to
these GPCR may disturb function of other cells, like endothelial cell
function, which was shown to be impaired in CFS patients (Newton
et al., 2012).
Further evidence for a pathogenic relevance of such autoanti-
bodies comes from clinical trials removing autoantibodies by
immune apheresis. Both, non-selective immunoadsorption as well
as selective b1 autoantibody removal led to improvement of
haemodynamic parameters and long-term outcome in inflamma-
tory cardiomyopathy (Dandel et al., 2013; Dorffel et al., 1997;
Klein-Weigel et al., 2014; Muller et al., 2000). In autoantibody-
mediated autoimmune diseases depletion of memory B cells with
rituximab can be effective if the autoantibody production is mainly
by short lived ‘‘early” plasma cells that to some extent express
CD20. Recent studies from Norway showed that about 60% of CFS
patients responded to rituximab treatment. Onset of clinical remis-
sion is delayed for 3–8 months after B-cell depletion suggesting an
indirect effect on autoantibody production. Indeed, we could
observe a significant decline of b2 AdR and M4 AChR receptor anti-
bodies following rituximab treatment in clinical responder. This
finding provides further evidence for a possible pathogenic role
of these autoantibodies in CFS. Our observation of a decrease of
M and b receptor autoantibodies in patients responding to ritux-
imab, in whom levels pre-treatment were within the normal range
of control subjects, suggests that we may miss functionally patho-
genic antibodies by just assessing quantitative levels by ELISA. Out
of the 25 CFS patients with blood samples pre- and post-rituximab
treatment, eight had received two infusions rituximab two weeks
apart in the KTS-1 study, with a minimum of 17 months time inter-
val, and with recovered B cells in peripheral blood, before inclusion
in the KTS-2 study. A presumed effect of previous B-cell depletion
period would be further lowering of autoantibody levels. Further,
these eight patients were divided between four responder and four
non-responder, and should therefore not have a major influence on
the interpretation.
In conclusion, there is evidence for elevated autoantibodies
against b2 AdR and M AChR in a subset of patients with CFS.
Although the function of these antibodies in CFS at present is
unclear, the association of b2 AdR and M AChR antibodies with
immune activation markers and their decline in CFS patients
responding to B-cell depletion may support a pathogenic role
and warrants their testing as potential biomarkers in clinical trials
of B-cell/antibody depleting therapy. It is conceivable that various
symptoms of CFS including cognitive deficits, autonomic dysregu-
lation and immune activation could be partly mediated by autoan-
tibodies against these receptors in a subset of patients.
