ABSTRACT
Objective: To assess the effect of dose increase in adult patients 
with schizophrenia who demonstrate inadequate initial response 
to standard-dose lurasidone and to evaluate the efficacy of low-
dose lurasidone in adult patients with schizophrenia.
Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
study conducted between May 2013 and June 2014, hospitalized 
patients with acute schizophrenia (DSM-IV-TR criteria) were 
randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with lurasidone 20 
mg/d (n = 101), lurasidone 80 mg/d (n = 199), or placebo (n = 112). 
Nonresponders to lurasidone 80 mg/d (Positive and Negative 
Syndrome Scale [PANSS] score decrease < 20%) at 2 weeks 
were re-randomized to lurasidone 80 mg/d or 160 mg/d for the 
remaining 4 weeks of the study. The primary outcome measure 
was change from baseline to week 6 in PANSS total score.
Results: In nonresponders to lurasidone 80 mg/d (n = 95), dose 
increase to 160 mg/d at week 2 significantly reduced PANSS 
total score at week 6 study endpoint compared with continuing 
80 mg/d (–16.6 vs –8.9; P < .05 [effect size = 0.52]). While a 
comparable magnitude of improvement was observed in Clinical 
Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) score from week 2 to week 6 
endpoint for lurasidone 160 mg/d versus 80 mg/d (–1.0 vs –0.6; 
effect size = 0.44), the difference was not statistically significant 
(P = .052). Patients receiving lurasidone 20 mg/d did not 
demonstrate significant improvement compared with placebo at 
week 6 in PANSS total (–17.6 vs –14.5; P = .26) or CGI-S (–0.93 vs 
–0.73; P = .17) scores. Few dose-related adverse effects associated 
with lurasidone were observed.
Conclusions: In adult patients with schizophrenia demonstrating 
nonresponse to 2 weeks of treatment with lurasidone 80 mg/d, 
dose increase to 160 mg/d resulted in significant symptom 
improvement compared with continuing lurasidone 80 mg/d. 
Lurasidone 20 mg/d was not associated with significant 
improvement in psychotic symptoms in adult patients with 
schizophrenia.

L
ack of adequate improvement early in the course of 
antipsychotic therapy has been established as a predictor 
of later nonresponse in multiple short-term studies of patients 
with acute schizophrenia.1–10 Strategies for addressing early 
nonresponse have not been well studied, however, resulting in 
little empirical evidence to inform clinical decision-making for 
patients with schizophrenia who demonstrate an inadequate 
initial response to treatment. Potential management 
strategies for early nonresponse include continuation of the 
initial treatment (ie, waiting for further improvement), dose 
escalation, augmentation with adjunctive treatments, or a 
switch to another antipsychotic medication.11,12
Lurasidone is an atypical antipsychotic agent with high 
binding affinity for D2, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT7 receptors 
(antagonist), moderate affinity for 5-HT1A receptors (partial 
agonist), and no appreciable affinity for H1 and M1 receptors.13 
Lurasidone was approved for the treatment of adult patients 
with schizophrenia based on 5 short-term, placebo-controlled 
studies that evaluated the dose range of 40–160 mg/d.14–18 The 
current study had 2 main objectives: to evaluate the efficacy 
of lurasidone dose increase in patients with an inadequate 
response after 2 weeks of standard-dose lurasidone therapy and 
to determine the potential efficacy of low-dose lurasidone (20 
mg/d) in patients with schizophrenia.
METHODS
Patients
This study enrolled patients 18–75 years of age diagnosed 
with schizophrenia for ≥ 6 months (DSM-IV-TR criteria) and 
experiencing an acute exacerbation (< 2 months in duration), 
as indicated by a PANSS total score ≥ 80; a PANSS item score 
≥ 4 (moderate) on ≥ 2 of the following items: delusions, 
conceptual disorganization, hallucinations, and unusual 
thought content; and a Clinical Global Impression-Severity 
(CGI-S) score ≥ 4 (moderately ill). Patients were excluded 
if another DSM-IV diagnosis had been the primary focus of 
treatment within the previous 3 months or if they had a history 
of alcohol or substance abuse (previous 3 months), showed 
evidence of a severe movement disorder, or were considered 
by the investigator to be at imminent risk of suicide or injury 
to self or others.
The study was approved by an institutional review board 
or ethics committee at each investigational site and was 
conducted in accordance with the International Conference on

Harmonization Good Clinical Practices guidelines and with 
the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. After 
complete description of the study to the patients, written 
informed consent was obtained. The study was registered at 
ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT01821378).
Study Design
This multiregional, 6-week, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was conducted 
between May 2013 and June 2014. The rationale and design 
of this study are discussed in greater detail in a separate 
report.19
A total of 412 patients underwent random assignment in 
a 1:2:1 ratio via an interactive voice/web response system to 
receive fixed-dose lurasidone 20 mg/d, lurasidone 80 mg/d, 
or placebo. Study medication was provided in blister packs 
of identically matched lurasidone 20 mg, lurasidone 40 mg, 
or placebo tablets. A central randomization center used a 
computer-generated list of random numbers to allocate study 
treatments. None of the investigators, study staff, or patients 
had access to randomization codes or list. Study medication 
was taken in the evening with a meal or within 30 minutes 
after eating. Patients assigned to lurasidone 20 mg/d or 
placebo received the same medication throughout the study. 
Patients assigned to lurasidone 80 mg/d received this dose for 
the first 2 weeks, at which time they were classified as early 
responders (≥ 20% improvement from baseline in PANSS 
total score) or early nonresponders (< 20% improvement). 
Early responders continued to take lurasidone 80 mg/d, 
while early nonresponders were re-randomized in a 1:1 
ratio either to continue lurasidone 80 mg/d or to receive 160 
mg/d for the remaining 4 weeks of the study. Exposure to 
lurasidone was evaluated using pharmacokinetic analysis of 
blood samples taken at weeks 2, 4, and 6.
Hospitalization was mandatory for all patients through 
week 3, after which patients deemed clinically stable and 
appropriate for discharge (including CGI-S score ≤ 3) were 
followed as outpatients.
Concomitant Medications
Treatment with anticholinergic agents or propranolol 
was permitted for movement disorders as needed (but not 
prophylactically). Lorazepam, temazepam, and zolpidem 
(or their equivalents) were permitted as needed for anxiety 
or insomnia but not within 8 hours of any psychiatric 
assessment.
Efficacy Assessments
Efficacy and safety assessments were performed by 
qualified site-based raters. The primary and key secondary 
efficacy endpoints were the change from baseline to week 
6 in PANSS total score and CGI-S score, respectively, for 
the lurasidone 20 mg/d group compared with the placebo 
group. Secondary efficacy endpoints included change from 
baseline to week 6 on the PANSS and CGI-S for patients 
randomized to 80 mg/d compared with the placebo group 
and change from week 2 to week 6 for early nonresponders 
who received lurasidone 160 mg/d versus 80 mg/d.
Safety and Tolerability Evaluation
Safety and tolerability were assessed by the incidence 
and severity of adverse events during the study. Movement 
disorders were assessed by the Simpson-Angus Scale, the 
Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale, and the Abnormal Involuntary 
Movement Scale. Additional safety evaluations included 
vital signs, laboratory tests, 12-lead electrocardiogram 
(ECG), and physical examination. Suicidal ideation and 
behavior were assessed using the Columbia-Suicide Severity 
Rating Scale (C-SSRS).
Statistical Analysis
The intent-to-treat (ITT) population consisted of 
randomly assigned patients who received at least 1 dose 
of study medication and had a least 1 postbaseline efficacy 
assessment. The early nonresponder (ENR) ITT population 
consisted of patients in the lurasidone 80 mg/d group who 
were re-randomized at week 2 (to lurasidone 80 mg/d or 
160 mg/d), received at least 1 dose of study medication 
after randomization, and had at least 1 subsequent efficacy 
assessment. For early nonresponders who continued on 
lurasidone 80 mg/d (ENR 80 mg) or increased to 160 mg/d 
(ENR 160 mg), efficacy results are presented from week 2 
(time of re-randomization) to week 6. Efficacy endpoints 
were evaluated using a mixed model for repeated measures 
(MMRM) analysis that included treatment, visit, pooled 
center, baseline scores, and a treatment-by-visit interaction 
term, using an unstructured covariance matrix for within-
patient correlation. To preserve the type I error rate, a 
sequential testing procedure was employed, with the 
primary efficacy variable (change in PANSS total score for 
lurasidone 20 mg/d vs placebo) tested first. Interpretation 
of the result for the key secondary variable (CGI-S for 
lurasidone 20 mg/d vs placebo) could be made only if the 
result for the primary variable was significant. There were 
no adjustments for multiplicity for other secondary efficacy 
analyses.
The proportion of responders at study endpoint (defined 
as ≥ 20% or ≥ 30% reduction from baseline PANSS total 
score [with 30 points subtracted from each score to account 
for the scale range]) was compared between the lurasidone 
Clinical Points
 
■ Limited evidence is available to guide clinicians in 
selecting appropriate treatment strategies for patients 
with schizophrenia who demonstrate early nonresponse 
to antipsychotic therapy.
 
■ This study provides controlled evidence that early 
nonresponders with schizophrenia may benefit from an 
increase in lurasidone dose from 80 mg/d to 160 mg/d. 
Significantly greater improvement in schizophrenia 
symptoms was found after lurasidone dose escalation 
compared with continuing the initial dose.
 
■  Lurasidone 20 mg/d was not efficacious for the treatment 
of adult patients with acute schizophrenia.

and placebo groups using logistic regression with the last 
observation carried forward (LOCF). The number needed 
to treat (NNT) to attain 1 additional responder was derived 
for the lurasidone groups as follows: NNT = 1/(lurasidone 
responders – placebo responders).
The safety population included all patients who were 
randomly assigned and received at least 1 dose of study 
medication. For all patients, including early nonresponders 
re-randomized at week 2, safety data were summarized from 
study baseline through endpoint.
Sample size was determined based on 2-sample t tests 
and powered at 80%. One hundred fifty patients (75 patients 
for each of the placebo and lurasidone 20 mg/d arms) were 
estimated to be required to detect an 8.8-point difference 
in mean change from baseline to week 6 in PANSS total 
score between lurasidone 20 mg/d and placebo (with a 
pooled standard deviation [SD] of 19). It was estimated 
that 92 patients (46 patients for each of the lurasidone 
ENR 80 mg/d and ENR 160 mg/d arms) were required to 
detect an 11.3-point treatment difference in mean change 
from week 2 to week 6 (with a pooled SD of 19). The total 
estimated sample size of 400 patients (placebo: 100 patients, 
lurasidone 20 mg/d: 100 patients, and lurasidone 80 mg/d: 
200 patients) included an additional 86 patients based on 
expected attrition.
RESULTS
A total of 412 patients met all eligibility criteria and 
were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with 
lurasidone 20 mg/d (n = 101), lurasidone 80 mg/d (n = 199), 
or placebo (n = 112) (Figure 1). Demographic and clinical 
characteristics were similar for the 3 treatment groups 
randomized at study baseline (Table 1). After 2 weeks of 
treatment with lurasidone 80 mg/d, 98 patients (49.5%) 
were classified as early nonresponders (< 20% improvement 
in PANSS total score) and re-randomized to continued 
treatment with lurasidone 80 mg/d (n = 55) or lurasidone 
160 mg/d (n = 43).
Efficacy
In patients classified as early nonresponders at week 
2, least squares (LS) mean change from week 2 to week 6 
in PANSS total score was significantly greater for patients 
whose lurasidone dose was increased to 160 mg/d compared 
with that for patients who continued receiving 80 mg/d 
(–16.6 vs –8.9 [difference, 7.7]; P < .05 [effect size = 0.52]; 
Figure 2A). While a comparable magnitude of improvement 
was observed in CGI-S score from week 2 to week 6 for 
early nonresponders re-randomized to lurasidone 160 mg/d 
versus 80 mg/d (LS mean change, –1.0 vs –0.6 [difference, 
0.4]; effect size = 0.44), the difference was not statistically 
significant (P = .052; Figure 2B). Treatment response 
(defined as ≥ 20% decrease in PANSS total score from study 
baseline to week 6, LOCF) was demonstrated by 74.4% and 
59.6% of early nonresponders re-randomized to lurasidone 
160 mg/d and 80 mg/d, respectively (P = .164 [NNT, 7]); 
treatment response defined as ≥ 30% PANSS total score 
decrease was demonstrated by 53.5% and 38.5% of patients, 
respectively (P = .177 [NNT, 7]). Results for other secondary 
efficacy outcomes in early nonresponders are reported in 
Supplementary eTable 1 (available at PSYCHIATRIST.COM).

In patients receiving lurasidone 20 mg/d, LS mean change 
from baseline to week 6 in PANSS total score (the primary 
study endpoint, MMRM analysis) was not significantly 
different compared with patients receiving placebo (–17.6 
vs –14.5; P = .26 [effect size = 0.19]). Similarly, LS mean 
change on the CGI-S was not significantly different in 
patients receiving lurasidone 20 mg/d compared with 
placebo (–0.9 vs –0.7; P = .17 [effect size = 0.22]). Patients 
initially randomized to lurasidone 80 mg/d demonstrated 
significant improvement overall compared with the placebo 
group at week 6 on both the PANSS (LS mean change, –24.9; 
P < .001 [effect size = 0.63]) and CGI-S (LS mean change, 
–1.3; P < .001 [effect size = 0.64]) scores (Figure 3A and 3B). 
These findings supported the assay sensitivity of the study.
Pharmacokinetic analysis evaluated the relationship 
between lurasidone exposure and early response/
nonresponse (eAppendix 1).
Safety
Adverse events with incidence ≥ 5% from study baseline 
to endpoint are listed in Table 2 for the following groups: 
lurasidone 20 mg/d, early nonresponders re-randomized to 
lurasidone 80 mg/d, and early nonresponders re-randomized 
to lurasidone 160 mg/d. Serious treatment-emergent adverse 
events were reported in 3 patients in the lurasidone 20 mg/d 
group, 4 patients in the early nonresponder 80 mg/d group, 
1 patient in the early nonresponder 160 mg/d group, and 8 
patients in the placebo group. No deaths occurred during 
the study. In early nonresponders, patients whose dose 
was increased to lurasidone 160 mg/d reported a greater 
incidence of anxiety, abdominal discomfort, akathisia, 
insomnia, and somnolence compared with patients who 
continued on lurasidone 80 mg/d (Table 2). The adverse 
event profile was similar for early responders to lurasidone 
80 mg/d (Supplementary eTable 2) and early nonresponders 
continued on lurasidone 80 mg/d, except for akathisia 
(16.0% vs 3.6%) and parkinsonism (5.0% vs 0.0%), which 
were more common in early responders. Adverse events with 
onset after re-randomization of early nonresponders at week 
2 are shown in Supplementary eTable 3.
The proportion of patients with treatment-emergent 
suicidal ideation, per the C-SSRS, was 2.0% in the lurasidone 
20 mg/d group, 3.6% in the early nonresponder 80 mg/d 
group, 4.7% in the early nonresponder 160 mg/d group, and 
0% in the placebo group. There were no suicidal behavior 
reports or completed suicides during the study.
The incidence of extrapyramidal symptom–related 
adverse events is reported in Table 2. The proportion of 
patients who received anticholinergic medication at any time 
during treatment with study medication was 5.0% in the 
lurasidone 20 mg/d group, 9.0% in the early nonresponder 
80 mg/d group, 9.3% in the early nonresponder 160 mg/d 
group, and 4.5% in the placebo group. LS mean change from 
baseline to LOCF endpoint in Simpson-Angus Scale, Barnes 
Akathisia Scale, and Abnormal Involuntary Movement 
Scale scores was small and not clinically meaningful in all 
treatment groups.
There were no clinically meaningful differences in the 
effect of treatment on laboratory parameters or vital signs 
(Table 3) or on ECG assessments between the lurasidone 
groups and the placebo group. Minimal changes in weight 
were observed across all groups, with no significant 
differences for the lurasidone groups (20 mg/d and 80 
mg/d at initial randomization) compared with placebo. 
No patients in any lurasidone group had a postbaseline 
change in QTc Fridericia > 60 ms or a postbaseline QTc

DISCUSSION
This study utilized a rigorous, placebo-controlled design 
to evaluate the effect of dose escalation in adult patients 
with schizophrenia who demonstrated an inadequate initial 
response to lurasidone. The results reported here support 
the safety and efficacy of dose escalation as a strategy 
for addressing early nonresponse to a standard dose of 
lurasidone in patients with schizophrenia. Dose increase 
to lurasidone 160 mg/d was associated with statistically 
significant and clinically meaningful improvement in 
symptoms of schizophrenia, as assessed by the PANSS total 
score, compared with continuation of the initial dose in 
early nonresponders to lurasidone 80 mg/d (P < .05; week 
6 effect size = 0.52). In addition, clinically meaningful but 
statistically nonsignificant improvement was observed on 
the CGI-S (P = .052; week 6 effect size = 0.44).

A. PANSS Total Scoreb
B. CGI-S Scored
Early nonresponse to antipsychotic therapy in patients 
with schizophrenia has been identified as a robust predictor 
of poor response at short-term trial endpoints.1 In this 
study, response/nonresponse was assessed after 2 weeks of 
treatment based on converging evidence from schizophrenia 
studies that evaluated receiver operating characteristics (eg, 
sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive 
values) and found that a 2-week decision time point may be 
ideal for prediction of short-term outcomes.2,6–9
PANSS total score reduction < 20% was utilized to define 
nonresponse in this study. This change in PANSS total 
score is comparable to a rating of minimally improved or 
worse on the CGI-Improvement scale20 and consistent with 
response thresholds utilized in previous research.4,7,21,22 
Using this threshold of response, the present study showed 
that increasing the lurasidone dose to 160 mg/d at week 2 in 
nonresponders to lurasidone 80 mg/d was associated with 
a week 6 response rate of 74.4% compared with 59.6% for

patients who continued the 80 mg/d dose. The placebo-
adjusted difference in response rates (or treatment effect 
size) for lurasidone 160 mg/d versus 80 mg/d was essentially 
unchanged when the response threshold was increased to 
a ≥ 30% decrease from baseline PANSS total score (14.8%, 
NNT = 7 vs 15.0%, NNT = 7), suggesting that this finding was 
not dependent on PANSS response threshold. Increasing the 
lurasidone dose from 80 mg/d to 160 mg/d was associated 
with modest increases in the incidence of anxiety, abdominal 
discomfort, akathisia, insomnia, and somnolence, relative 
to continuing lurasidone 80 mg/d. Consistent with previous 
studies,23,24 short-term treatment with lurasidone in this 
study showed no clinically meaningful effects on weight, 
lipid parameters, and glucose levels.
We note that an appreciable proportion of patients 
classified as nonresponders at week 2 in this study went 
on to demonstrate response after 6 weeks of treatment in 
the absence of dose escalation (ie, on lurasidone 80 mg/d). 
Therefore, the increased probability of response in early 
nonresponders after dose escalation to lurasidone 160 mg/d 
should be considered in the context of the risk-versus-benefit 
findings associated with this strategy. These considerations 
include a modest increase in the frequency of certain adverse 
events and the clinical need to enhance the rate of response.
Study designs for evaluating the effectiveness of 
dose escalation in early nonresponding patients with 
schizophrenia have been proposed by Correll et al.25 
However, few randomized, controlled studies have 
evaluated dose escalation as a strategy for addressing early 
nonresponse to antipsychotic therapy. A recent meta-
analysis26 included 5 trials (348 patients) investigating 
dose escalation with quetiapine (2 studies), ziprasidone, 
haloperidol, or fluphenazine. There was no evidence 
that patients with early nonresponse benefited from dose 
escalation; no significant differences were found in mean 
PANSS/Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale score change between 
the dose-increase and control groups, and the pooled effect 
size for the primary outcome was 0.14.26 Sample sizes were 
relatively small, however, and nonresponse was assessed after 
3 or 4 weeks of treatment in most studies. None of the 5 
studies included a placebo-only treatment arm, and the 3 
more recent studies that tested dose escalation of quetiapine 
and ziprasidone examined supratherapeutic doses that 
exceeded the maximum recommended limit contained in 
product labeling.
In contrast to prior studies, dose escalation was found to 
be efficacious in this study of patients with schizophrenia 
treated with lurasidone. Several factors may have 
contributed to the ability to detect an effect of lurasidone 
dose escalation in this study. First, inclusion of a placebo-
control group may have reduced expectation bias toward 
improvement on the part of both patients and investigators, 
thereby enhancing signal detection in this study. Second, it 
is possible that D2 receptor occupancy was more optimal 
in early nonresponders treated with lurasidone 160 mg/d 
compared with 80 mg/d. Imaging studies have shown a 
strong relationship between serum lurasidone concentration 
and D2 receptor occupancy.27,28 A PET study of patients with

Loebel et al
schizophrenia randomly assigned to receive lurasidone 80, 
120, or 160 mg/d for 1 week indicated that doses greater than 
80 mg/d may be necessary to achieve therapeutic threshold 
levels of D2 receptor occupancy in some patients.28 In 
support of these observations, in this study, serum lurasidone 
concentration increased in a dose-related fashion, with an 
approximately 2-fold increase observed in patients treated 
with lurasidone 160 mg/d compared with patients continued 
on 80 mg/d. Notably, serum lurasidone concentration in 
patients receiving lurasidone 80 mg/d did not differentiate 
treatment responders from nonresponders at week 2. Third, 
in a prior short-term, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose study 
in patients with schizophrenia, a significantly higher rate of 
response was observed in patients treated with lurasidone 
160 mg/d compared with 80 mg/d.18,29 The observed effects 
of lurasidone dose escalation in the current study are 
therefore consistent with previous observations of dose-
response in association with lurasidone treatment.30
In this study, lurasidone 20 mg/d was not found to 
be efficacious in the treatment of patients with an acute 
exacerbation of schizophrenia. In contrast, the patient 
group initially randomized to 80 mg/d showed substantial 
improvement on the PANSS and CGI-S compared with 
the placebo group (week 6 effect sizes of 0.63 and 0.64, 
respectively). Given the efficacy demonstrated in patients 
randomized to lurasidone 80 mg/d, it appears that the 
absence of significant improvement in psychotic symptoms 
associated with lurasidone 20 mg/d represents a true negative 
result (because an effect of treatment was demonstrated in 
the group exposed to standard-dose lurasidone) and not 
a failed study (in which known effective treatment[s] or 
dose[s] fail to separate from placebo). This study, taken 
together with the findings from previous lurasidone efficacy 
trials, indicates that the lowest effective dose of lurasidone 
for the treatment of schizophrenia is 40 mg/d, as noted in 
current prescribing information.31
Several study limitations should be noted. The efficacy of 
dose escalation represented a secondary assessment in this 
study (the efficacy of lurasidone 20 mg/d was the primary 
endpoint). Treatment duration was relatively brief, and it is 
not known whether the differences between lurasidone 160 
mg/d and 80 mg/d observed in this short-term study would 
be maintained beyond 4 weeks of treatment. The effect of 
increase to an intermediate lurasidone dose between 80 
mg/d and 160 mg/d (ie, 120 mg/d) in patients with early 
nonresponse was not evaluated in this study. It is possible 
that determination of nonresponse at a different time point 
(particularly later than 2 weeks) may reduce observed 
differences between the lurasidone dose groups. Assessment 
of adverse effect frequencies associated with standard versus 
high lurasidone dose was limited due to relatively small 
sample sizes and number of adverse event reports.
In this study, dose increase of lurasidone in early 
nonresponders resulted in superior efficacy compared 
with continuing the initial dose, with modest increases in 
the incidence of some adverse events. Lurasidone 20 mg/d 
was not found to be an efficacious treatment for patients 
with schizophrenia, supporting the currently recommended 
lurasidone dose range of 40–160 mg/d. Dose escalation 
may be a preferred treatment approach for patients with 
schizophrenia who demonstrate an inadequate initial 
response to lurasidone.

 eAppendix 1 
Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
Pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationship between lurasidone 
exposure and early response/nonresponse. Mean (SD) trough serum concentration of lurasidone 
at week 2 was 8.2 (5.3) ng/mL in early responders (n = 55) and 10.3 (8.9) ng/mL in early 
nonresponders (n = 71) to lurasidone 80 mg/day. At week 6, mean (SD) serum concentration at 
14–15 hours postdose was 13.3 (10.2) ng/mL in early responders (n = 18), 14.7 (12.3) ng/mL in 
early nonresponders continued on lurasidone 80 mg/day (n = 15), and 29.1 (18.5) ng/mL in early 
nonresponders with dose increased to 160 mg/day (n = 11).
