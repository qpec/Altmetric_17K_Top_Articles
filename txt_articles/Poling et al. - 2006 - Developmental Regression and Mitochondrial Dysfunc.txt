Abstract
Autistic spectrum disorders can be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. We present a singleton
case of developmental regression and oxidative phosphorylation disorder in a 19-month-old girl.
Subtle abnormalities in the serum creatine kinase level, aspartate aminotransferase, and serum
bicarbonate led us to perform a muscle biopsy, which showed type I myofiber atrophy, increased
lipid content, and reduced cytochrome c oxidase activity. There were marked reductions in enzymatic
activities for complex I and III. Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) activity was near the 5%
confidence level. To determine the frequency of routine laboratory abnormalities in similar patients,
we performed a retrospective study including 159 patients with autism (Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders-IV and Childhood Autism Rating Scale) not previously diagnosed with
metabolic disorders and 94 age-matched controls with other neurologic disorders. Aspartate
aminotransferase was elevated in 38% of patients with autism compared with 15% of controls (P < .
0001). The serum creatine kinase level also was abnormally elevated in 22 (47%) of 47 patients with
autism. These data suggest that further metabolic evaluation is indicated in autistic patients and that
defects of oxidative phosphorylation might be prevalent.
The autism spectrum disorders comprise a heterogeneous group of patients who exhibit similar
behavioral phenotypes. The etiologies of autism remain idiopathic in most cases despite
comprehensive investigations. Others have reported functional mitochondrial abnormalities in
patients with autism and epilepsy,1 mitochondrial DNA G8363A transfer ribonucleic acid
(Lys) mutation,2 chromosome 15q inverted duplication,3 and A3243G mitochondrial DNA
mutation or mitochondrial DNA depletion.4 Patients with Rett syndrome are known to have
mitochondrial ultrastructural abnormalities,5 as well as abnormalities in oxidative
phosphorylation enzymes.6 We describe a female patient in whom developmental regression
and autism followed normal development and subtle laboratory abnormalities suggesting
mitochondrial dysfunction led to a diagnostic muscle biopsy.

 Case Report
A 19-month-old girl was born after a normal full-term pregnancy. There was no family history
of autism or affective, neuromuscular, or hearing disorders. Her development was progressing
well, with normal receptive and expressive language and use of prelinguistic gestures, such as
pointing for joint attention. Imaginary play and social reciprocity were typical for age. She
used at least 20 words and could point to five body parts on command. Several immunizations
were delayed owing to frequent bouts of otitis media with fever.
Within 48 hours after immunizations to diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis; Haemophilus
influenzae B; measles, mumps, and rubella; polio; and varicella (Varivax), the patient
developed a fever to 38.9°C, inconsolable crying, irritability, and lethargy and refused to walk.
Four days later, the patient was waking up multiple times in the night, having episodes of
opistho-tonus, and could no longer normally climb stairs. Instead, she crawled up and down
the stairs. Low-grade intermittent fever was noted for the next 12 days. Ten days following
immunization, the patient developed a generalized erythematous macular rash beginning in the
abdomen. The patient’s pediatrician diagnosed this as due to varicella vaccination. For 3
months, the patient was irritable and increasingly less responsive verbally, after which the
patient’s family noted clear autistic behaviors, such as spinning, gaze avoidance, disrupted
sleep/wake cycle, and perseveration on specific television programs. All expressive language
was lost by 22 months. The patient continued to have chronic yellow watery diarrhea
intermittently for 6 months, which was evaluated with negative testing for Clostridium
difficile, ova/parasites, and culture. Four months later, an evaluation with the Infant and
Toddlers Early Intervention program for possible autism was initiated. Along with the
regression, her appetite remained poor for 6 months and her body weight did not increase. This
resulted in a decline on a standard growth chart for weight from the 97th to the 75th percentile.
Evaluation at 23 months showed atopic dermatitis, slow hair growth, generalized mild
hypotonia, toe walking, and normal tendon reflexes. The Childhood Autism Rating Scale
(CARS) score was 33 (mild autism range), and she also met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
for Mental Disorders-IV criteria for autism. Laboratory findings included repeated
measurements of aspartate aminotransferase 40 IU/L (normal < 31 IU/L), serum bicarbonate
20 mmol/L (normal 21–31 mmol/L), serum creatine kinase level 203 IU/L (normal < 170 IU/
L), and fasting lactic acid 3.3 mmol/L (normal 0.5–2.2 mmol/L). Quantitative urinary organic
acid analyses showed trace amounts of dicarboxylic acids (adipic, suberic, octenedioic acids)
and small amounts of ethylmalonic and methylsuccinic acids, consistent with a fatty acid
oxidation dysfunction. Quantitative plasma amino acids were all within the normal range;
however, the alanine to lysine ratio (a surrogate marker for pyruvate; Dr Richard Kelley,
personal communication, 2001) was elevated at 3.2 (normal 1.5–2.5). Cranial magnetic
resonance imaging, otoacoustic emission testing, overnight electroencephalography with slow-
wave sleep, serum lead, chromosomes, and fragile X by DNA testing were all normal.
The patient was referred for muscle biopsy (J.S.) because of persistent mild lactic acidosis,
elevated serum creatine kinase level, and increased aspartate aminotransferase. A fresh vastus
lateralis biopsy was performed and examined as described previously.7,8 The biopsy showed
abnormal histology with type I myofiber atrophy, increased myofiber lipid content, and reduced
cytochrome c oxidase activity. Oxidative phosphorylation enzymology showed markedly
reduced complex I, I + III, and III activity. Complex IV activity was near the 5% confidence
limit of the control group (Table 1). Mitochondrial DNA sequencing of the skeletal muscle
was normal.
Now 6 years old, our patient has been treated with vitamin supplements since 2½ years of age.
Even before starting supplementation, the patient began speaking again at 23 months old and

 had a four-word vocabulary of “bubbles,” “ball,” “drink,” and “cracker.” Levocarnitine 250
mg and thiamine 50 mg three times per day were initiated when the patient was 29 months old.
Coenzyme Q10 was added at age 33 months. Although she still exhibits mild autistic behaviors,
our patient has continued to improve in language functions and sociability such that she now
attends a regular kindergarten with an aide. There have been slow yet steady improvements in
muscle tone, motor coordination, and gastrointestinal symptoms with occupational therapy,
applied behavioral analysis interventions, and mitochondrial enzyme cofactor supplements.
After the age of 2 years, growth trajectory has continued along the 75th percentile for both
height and weight. Laboratory tests were repeated at ages 2 years and 10 months (aspartate
aminotransferase 47 IU/L, normal < 38 IU/L; alanine transferase 20 IU/L, normal < 40 IU/L;
serum creatine kinase level 105 IU/L, normal < 194 IU/L), 4 years old (aspartate
aminotransferase 36 IU/L; alanine transferase 19 IU/L; serum creatine kinase level 169 IU/L),
and 6 years old (aspartate aminotransferase 36 IU/L; alanine transferase 21 IU/L; alanine to
lysine ratio 1.58, normal < 1.5 to 2.5). During an acute illness owing to C difficile, the aspartate
aminotransferase was on one occasion elevated to 50 IU/L; however, the serum creatine kinase
level remained normal at 169 IU/L. Urine organic acids and serum amino acids have been
normal at ages 3 and 6 years. Childhood Autism Rating Scale scores since beginning
kindergarten have been under 30.
Additional Studies
The subtle laboratory abnormities identified in this case led us to retrospectively evaluate the
laboratory records of other patients with autism. Records from the Kennedy Krieger Institute
between January 1995 and September 2002 were selected. Available laboratory tests processed
by the Johns Hopkins Hospital clinical laboratory were reviewed in 159 patients with autism
and 94 patients of a similar age with other neurologic disorders. Patients with autism met both
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV and Childhood Autism Rating Scale
criteria. Only a subset of laboratory values could be analyzed owing to sample size limitations.
Liver function tests were available in a reasonable number of subjects. Serum levels of aspartate
aminotransferase, but not alanine transferase, were significantly higher in autistic patients
compared with control patients (autism vs control mean [standard error]: aspartate
aminotransferase 36.3 [1.2] vs 29.7 [3.0]; alanine transferase 24.6 [3.0] vs 20.6 [2.5]; t-test:
aspartate aminotransferase P = .00005; alanine transferase P = .22). Chi-square analysis also
demonstrated that significantly more autistic patients demonstrated abnormal values for
aspartate aminotransferase but not alanine transferase (autistic vs control: aspartate
aminotransferase 46% vs 22%; alanine transaminase 6% vs 7%; chi-square: aspartate
aminotransferase 20.8, P = .000005; alanine transaminase 0.1, P > .50). Too few laboratory
values for the serume creatine kinase level were available from control subjects to directly
compare this laboratory value between autistic and control patients. However, the number of
abnormal serum creatine kinase level values was unusually high for the autistic group (22 of
46 [47%]; binomial probability: P < 1 × 10−14).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first description of an autistic child with mitochondrial
dysfunction, growth failure, and abnormal muscle histopathology without seizures or a defined
chromosomal abnormality. This patient exemplifies important questions about mitochondrial
function in autism and developmental regression. It is unclear whether mitochondrial
dysfunction results from a primary genetic abnormality, atypical development of essential
metabolic pathways, or secondary inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation by other factors. If
such dysfunction is present at the time of infections and immunizations in young children, the
added oxidative stresses from immune activation on cellular energy metabolism are likely to
be especially critical for the central nervous system, which is highly dependent on

 mitochondrial function. Young children who have dysfunctional cellular energy metabolism
therefore might be more prone to undergo autistic regression between 18 and 30 months of age
if they also have infections or immunizations at the same time. Although patterns of regression
can be genetically and prenatally determined,9 it is possible that underlying mitochondrial
dysfunction can either exacerbate or affect the severity of regression. Abnormalities of
oxidative phosphorylation can be developmental and age related and can normalize with time.

Our findings of mildly increased aspartate aminotransferase and serum creatine kinase level
in children with autism might reflect abnormal mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle since
alanine transaminase and other liver enzymes were normal. Without muscle biopsy data, it is
not entirely possible for us to exclude that false-positive laboratory results contribute to our
high rate of aspartate aminotransferase and serum creatine kinase level abnormalities. As
pointed out by others, children who struggle during venipuncture can skew the results of blood
analysis.11 However, our laboratory uses a hemolysis index that specifically avoids falsely
elevated aspartate aminotransferase. Further prospective biochemical studies are needed to
evaluate mitochondrial function in children within the autistic spectrum. There is a need for
reliable laboratory markers to detect abnormalities of mitochondrial function, which will then
facilitate further clinical investigations in this subgroup of children with autism.
