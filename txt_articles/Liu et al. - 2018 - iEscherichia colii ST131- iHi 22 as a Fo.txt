ABSTRACT
Escherichia coli sequence type 131 (ST131) has emerged rapidly to be-
come the most prevalent extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli clones in circulation to-
day. Previous investigations appeared to exonerate retail meat as a source of human
exposure to ST131; however, these studies focused mainly on extensively multidrug-
resistant ST131 strains, which typically carry allele 30 of the fimH type 1 fimbrial
adhesin gene (ST131-H30). To estimate the frequency of extraintestinal human infec-
tions arising from foodborne ST131 strains without bias toward particular sublin-
eages or phenotypes, we conducted a 1-year prospective study of E. coli from meat
products and clinical cultures in Flagstaff, Arizona. We characterized all isolates by
multilocus sequence typing, fimH typing, and core genome phylogenetic analyses,
and we screened isolates for avian-associated ColV plasmids as an indication of
poultry adaptation. E. coli was isolated from 79.8% of the 2,452 meat samples and
72.4% of the 1,735 culture-positive clinical samples. Twenty-seven meat isolates were
ST131 and belonged almost exclusively (n � 25) to the ST131-H22 lineage. All but 1
of the 25 H22 meat isolates were from poultry products, and all but 2 carried
poultry-associated ColV plasmids. Of the 1,188 contemporaneous human clinical
E. coli isolates, 24 were ST131-H22, one-quarter of which occurred in the same high-
resolution phylogenetic clades as the ST131-H22 meat isolates and carried ColV plas-
mids. Molecular clock analysis of an international ST131-H22 genome collection sug-
gested that ColV plasmids have been acquired at least six times since the 1940s and
that poultry-to-human transmission is not limited to the United States.
IMPORTANCE
E. coli ST131 is an important extraintestinal pathogen that can colo-
nize the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and food animals. Here, we combined de-
tection of accessory traits associated with avian adaptation (ColV plasmids) with
high-resolution phylogenetics to quantify the portion of human infections caused by
ST131 strains of food animal origin. Our results suggest that one ST131 sublineage—
ST131-H22—has become established in poultry populations around the world and
that meat may serve as a vehicle for human exposure and infection. ST131-H22 is
just one of many E. coli lineages that may be transmitted from food animals to hu-
mans. Additional studies that combine detection of host-associated accessory ele-
ments with phylogenetics may allow us to quantify the total fraction of human ex-
traintestinal infections attributable to food animal E. coli strains.

E
scherichia coli causes millions of extraintestinal infections in the United States each
year, including urinary tract infections (UTIs) (1, 2). In contrast to bladder infections,
which typically amount to little more than a painful annoyance, invasive UTIs that
involve the kidneys and bloodstream can be life-threatening (3). The emergence of
extensively antimicrobial-resistant E. coli strains has increased the hazard posed by
these common infections (4, 5). The potential for food animal E. coli strains to make
their way to humans via contaminated meat and to cause UTIs was proposed as early
as 1970 (6). Despite early supportive studies (7–11), the concept did not gain popularity
until more than two decades later, when separate UTI outbreaks in Denmark, Canada,
and the United States were postulated to have been caused by foodborne E. coli strains
(12–15). In subsequent years, many studies have shown that extraintestinal pathogenic
E. coli strains routinely colonize food animals and contaminate the food supply (16–19).
The likely link between foodborne E. coli and human urinary tract infections under-
scores the public health relevance of use of antibiotics in food animal production,
which was recognized by researchers from the very beginning (6, 20).
Antibiotic use in food animal production, which is well established as contributing
to antibiotic resistance in classical foodborne pathogens such as Salmonella and
Campylobacter (21, 22), more recently has been linked to the emergence of antibiotic-
resistant colonizing opportunistic pathogens (COPs) such as Staphylococcus aureus and
Clostridium difficile in food animals and humans (23). Since its discovery in the early
2000s, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) sequence type 398 (ST398) has become a
model for how antibiotic use in food animal production can fuel the emergence of
novel COP strains that can spread to humans through occupational exposure and retail
meat (24–27). Likewise, compelling evidence now links multiple, antimicrobial-resistant
substrains of C. difficile ribotype 078 (RT078) to antimicrobial use in food animal
production (28). However, of all the COPs, those from Enterobacteriaceae may threaten
human health most, due to their broad host range and frequent exchange of mobile
resistance elements. This potential risk was highlighted by the discovery of the colistin
resistance gene mcr-1 in multiple E. coli strains from food animals, retail meat, and
people (29).
There is a need to quantify the human disease burden associated with E. coli from
food animals. A combination of phylogenetic analysis based on single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) from the E. coli core genome plus information regarding host-
adaptive accessory elements could enable investigators to more accurately identify the
host origins of isolates and infer directionality of such transmissions.
ColV plasmids have been recognized as a defining trait of avian pathogenic E. coli
(APEC) (30). These plasmids are self-transmissible F-type plasmids that harbor numer-
ous traits demonstrated to enhance the virulence and fitness of APEC strains in
colonizing and infecting commercial broiler chickens and turkeys (31). Collectively, ColV
plasmids and their virulence genes have been identified in greater than 80% of E. coli
isolated from diseased poultry, and they are highly predictive of the APEC pathotype
(32). In contrast, ColV plasmids are rarely found in human clinical E. coli isolates, and we
hypothesize that their presence in such isolates indicates evidence of historical zoo-
notic transmission from poultry to humans (33).
E. coli ST131 has emerged explosively since the early 2000s to become the most
important multidrug-resistant uropathogen in circulation today (5, 34). High-resolution
phylogenetic analyses have identified multiple lineages within ST131 (35, 36), each
associated with a specific allele of the type 1 fimbrial adhesin gene (fimH), including the
H22 and H27, H30, and H41 lineages. While ST131-H30 is the most prevalent and
extensively resistant of these ST131 lineages, all four are important etiologic agents for
community-acquired UTI (37–39). The ST131-H22 lineage is of particular interest be-
cause of its ability to colonize poultry, contaminate meat, and carry the mcr-1 and mcr-3

 mobile resistance determinants that confer resistance to colistin, the only available
active agent against certain extensively resistant Gram-negative pathogens (29, 40, 41).
Although previous studies suggested that food is not an important reservoir of
E. coli ST131 (19, 42), these studies focused on the better-known ST131-H30 lineage,
and so those findings may not accurately represent the epidemiology of other ST131
lineages, including ST131-H22. Therefore, to evaluate food as a potential source of UTI
caused by E. coli ST131-H22, we collected E. coli isolates from human extraintestinal
infections and retail meat products in a small, geographically isolated American city
over the course of 1 year and then compared the two E. coli populations by using a
unique combination of high-resolution phylogenetic analyses and ColV plasmid inter-
rogation.
RESULTS
Prevalence of E. coli ST131 among meat and human clinical isolates. During the
12-month study period, E. coli was recovered from 72.4% of the 1,735 positive clinical
urine and blood cultures and from 81.7% of the 2,460 meat products. In total, 1,923
meat isolates and 1,188 human clinical isolates were sequenced successfully and were
assigned to 443 E. coli STs. Of the 443 STs, 247 STs included only meat isolates (785
[40.8%] of meat isolates), 120 STs included only clinical isolates (403 [33.9%] of human
clinical isolates), and 76 STs included both meat and clinical isolates (1,138 [59.2%] of
meat isolates and 785 [66.1%] of clinical isolates). ST131 was detected among both
meat and human clinical isolates, and it was the single most common ST among the
clinical E. coli isolates (182/1,188 [15.3%]) and 13th among meat isolates (25/1,923
[1.3%]).
Phylogenetic relatedness of E. coli ST131 isolates from meat and human
clinical specimens. The genetic relationships between E. coli ST131 isolates from meat
and human clinical specimens were examined using a core genome SNP-based phy-
logenetic analysis. This total ST131 population exhibited four major lineages that
corresponded to the four major fimH alleles of ST131, i.e., fimH22, fimH27, fimH30, and
fimH41. One of these lineages, ST131-H22, included nearly all of the ST131 meat isolates
(24/25 [96%]), plus 24 (13%) of the ST131 human clinical isolates (Fig. 1A).
Patient demographics and clinical presentation. Patient demographics varied
significantly by ST131 lineage. Specifically, compared to patients with an ST131-H30
clinical isolate (n � 125), patients with an ST131-H22 clinical isolate (n � 24) had a
significantly lower median age (47 years, with interquartile range [IQR] of 37, versus
65 years and an IQR of 33: P � 0.008) and a higher female proportion (87.5% versus
76.0%; P � 0.29).
In contrast, among the 88 ST131 isolates (48% of 182) for which clinical data were
available, clinical presentation did not vary significantly by ST131 lineage. The overall
syndrome distribution was 48% asymptomatic bacteriuria, 32% cystitis, 17% pyelone-
phritis, and 5% urosepsis. This distribution did not differ significantly between the 16
ST131-H22 isolates (67% of 24) and 52 ST131-H30 isolates (42% of 125) for which clinical
data were available, i.e., 38% versus 56% asymptomatic bacteriuria, 44% versus 25%
cystitis, 19% versus 14% pyelonephritis, and 0% versus 6% urosepsis, respectively.
Avian-associated ColV plasmids and phylogenetic analysis of H22 human clin-
ical isolates. High-resolution phylogenetic analysis of the ST131-H22 lineage revealed
multiple distinct sublineages, two of which showed particularly close phylogenetic
similarity between human clinical and meat isolates (Fig. 1B). Ninety-three percent of
meat source ST131-H22 isolates were from poultry products; therefore, a potential link
between poultry and human clinical isolates was explored further based on the
presence of ColV plasmids, because ColV plasmids have been associated with E. coli
fitness and virulence in avian hosts and are a defining trait of avian pathogenic E. coli
(43). Plasmid profiling and draft genome comparisons identified a presumptive ColV
plasmid in 84% of meat source and 25% of human clinical source ST131-H22 isolates
(see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). In the core genome phylogeny, human
clinical isolates carrying ColV plasmids were more closely related to meat isolates

 carrying ColV plasmids than they were to human clinical isolates without the plasmids,
further supporting poultry as a source for the ST131-H22 human clinical isolates
(Fig. S2).
ColV plasmids and antimicrobial susceptibility in H22 isolates. ColV plasmid-
positive ST131-H22 isolates were more likely to be multidrug resistant than were ColV
plasmid-negative ST131-H22 isolates (Table 1). Furthermore, ColV plasmid-carrying
isolates were significantly more likely than ColV plasmid-negative isolates to be resis-
tant to tetracycline and gentamicin, two antibiotics commonly used in U.S. food animal
production (44). Consistent with resistance phenotypes, resistance-conferring genes
were also more prevalent among ColV plasmid-positive isolates than among ColV
plasmid-negative isolates (Data Set S2).
Natural history of ColV plasmids in ST131-H22. As noted above, multiple ST131-
H22 sublineages carry ColV plasmids. Three independent statistical modeling approach-
es—including coalescence-based analysis using a strict molecular clock, the GTR sub-
stitution model, and the Bayesian Skyline tree prior—suggested that ColV plasmids
were acquired by members of the H22 clade in at least six separate genetic events since
the mid-1940s (Fig. 2). Three of the six ColV plasmid-positive lineages showed inter-
mingling of human and meat isolates. In contrast, another of these lineages consisted
solely of human isolates. This clade’
s eight human isolates were all from Europe, where
FIG 1 Whole-genome phylogeny of meat and human clinical Escherichia coli ST131 isolates. (A) A total of 207 ST131 isolates from meat (in red) and human
clinical specimens (in yellow) were included in this unrooted phylogeny. The fimH alleles corresponded closely with the phylogenetic groupings and were used
to designate the four major lineages: H22, H27, H30, and H41. The ST131-H22 lineage included isolates with other fimH alleles fimH161 or fimH207, both of which
are minor sequence variants of fimH22. Most (69%) of the clinical isolates belonged to the ST131-H30 lineage, with the balance falling into the ST131-H41 (16%),
ST131-H22 (13%), and ST131-H27 (2%) lineages. In contrast, 93% of the meat isolates belonged to the ST131-H22 lineage. (B) Forty-nine ST131-H22 isolates from
meat (in red) and human clinical specimens (in yellow) were included in this rooted high-resolution phylogeny. While some subclades contained only human
clinical isolates, two subclades included intermingled meat and human clinical isolates. All ColV plasmid-positive ST131-H22 human clinical isolates fell within
the latter two subclades, suggesting that these meat and human clinical isolates were derived from a common source. The scale bar represents the substitution
rate in the conserved core genome. The branch leading to the H41 clade is truncated to approximately 20% of its full length for graphic purposes.

 meat products were not sampled in parallel with humans, likely decreasing the
opportunity for finding genomic commonality between meat and human isolates.
Analysis of the international collection of ST131-H22 genomes identified 22 addi-
tional ColV plasmid-carrying human isolates, indicating that putative poultry-to-human
transmission is not limited to Flagstaff, Arizona, but likely is a global phenomenon.
Mobile colistin resistance in ST131-H22. Two published ST131-H22 isolates were
identified previously as carrying mobile colistin resistance (mcr) determinants (40, 41).
Our genomic analysis showed that both carry ColV plasmids. When they were added to
the ST131-H22 core genome phylogram, each was assigned to an ST131-H22 clade that
included intermingled human and meat isolates (Fig. S3).
DISCUSSION
Our analysis of concurrently collected meat and clinical isolates from Flagstaff
showed that ST131-H22 accounted for nearly all of the ST131 meat isolates and for 13%
of the ST131 clinical isolates, mostly from patients with cystitis and pyelonephritis.
Importantly, whole-genome-based phylogenetic analysis showed that several subsets
of ST131-H22 clinical isolates were closely related to meat isolates and carried avian-
associated ColV plasmids (45, 46). Taken together, these findings support that a
nonnegligible subset of community-acquired E. coli ST131 UTI episodes in the United
States is foodborne.
Coalescence analysis suggests that the ST131-H22 lineage has acquired ColV plas-
mids at least six times, dating back as far as the 1940s. We assumed, for maximal
parsimony, that when most isolates within a phylogenetic clade were ColV positive, a
common ancestor to that clade acquired a ColV plasmid in a single genetic event and
that any ColV-negative isolates within the clade resulted from plasmid loss events. The
consistency of ColV plasmid carriage within some of the corresponding sublineages
suggests that such plasmids have remained under selection—possibly in poultry
flocks—for decades. If ST131-H22 strains have been circulating in poultry flocks since
the 1940s, countless spillover events from poultry to humans could have occurred over
the past several decades.
Three of the ColV plasmid-positive sublineages showed intermingling among iso-

 lates of human and poultry origin (Fig. 2). One exception was a sublineage composed
exclusively of European human isolates. This clade’
s polarized source distribution may
reflect a bias in EnteroBase toward European human isolates and away from poultry
isolates, rather than the establishment of a ColV plasmid-positive ST131-H22 sublineage
in humans, although this possibility cannot be excluded. Further sampling of poultry
flocks or meat from Europe is needed to investigate this question further.
Our findings support the hypothesis that the ST131-H22 strains that contaminate
retail poultry products originate from food animal populations rather than humans. If

 products, one would anticipate a more equal distribution of ST131 lineages, including
ST131-H30. Alternatively, compared to other ST131 sublineages, ST131-H22 strains may
have better survival in the processing plant environment or on poultry products, but
this seems less likely.
The evolving story of mobile colistin resistance elements among livestock-
associated E. coli strains underscores the importance of our findings. Shortly after the
discovery of mcr-1 in isolates from Chinese livestock and people (29), multiple short
reports described the retrospective detection of this element and other variants (mcr-2
and -3) from countries around the world (47–53). The first such report was from
Denmark, where investigators identified an mcr-1-positive extended-spectrum �-
lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli strain that had been isolated in 2012 from an
imported poultry product (40). Subsequently, this isolate was discovered to represent
the ST131-H22 lineage. Likewise, in 2017, an ESBL-producing Danish bloodstream
isolate from 2014 was reported that represened the ST131-H22 lineage and carry mcr-3
(41). The striking diversity of E. coli strains found to carry the mcr genes provides
empirical evidence of the associated mobile elements’promiscuity. The fact that the
gene has found its way into ST131-H22—a lineage capable of jumping hosts and
causing serious extraintestinal infections in humans—may make it difficult to prevent
the further spread of this element from livestock to humans.
Our study had several notable strengths that enabled us to estimate the relatedness
of ST131 strains from meat products and clinical specimens. First, we isolated E. coli
samples without bias toward any particular genotype or phenotype. Second, we
collected concurrent clinical isolates and retail meat samples in the same geographi-
cally isolated community. Third, we systematically sampled all available brands of
poultry and pork sold in the city, twice monthly, for a full year. Fourth, we analyzed all
publicly available ST131 genomes from meat, animal, and clinical isolates via a high-
resolution, whole-genome sequence-based approach. Previous studies of foodborne
UTI caused by ST131 focused on ST131-H30 (54, 55) or relied on convenience-based
sampling (19, 56, 57), which limited their ability to assess foodborne transmissions of
non-H30 ST131 strains. Such studies also were limited by their use of strain typing
methods (58) that did not provide the same phylogenetic resolution as does whole-
genome sequencing (35).
Our study also had limitations. First, we did not collect data on the shopping and
consumption habits of the source patients for the clinical isolates; this precluded a
search for correlations between the strains recovered from particular meat brands
versus from the people who purchased those brands, although such correlations likely
could be obscured by person-to-person transmission of strains initially from a food
source (59). Second, our analyses of ST131-H22 isolates outside Flagstaff were based on
publicly available genome sequences that were not systematically collected, which
precluded their use to assess host origins. However, these isolates did provide the
temporal diversity necessary to calibrate our molecular clock analyses. Finally, while we
have provided strong evidence that a substantial portion of the ST131-H22 strains
infecting humans originate from poultry, our study was insufficient to determine
definitively whether individual infections arose from direct exposure to contaminated
poultry or from human-to-human transmission following the exposure to contaminated
poultry. Despite these limitations, this study provides important new insights into the
epidemiology of extraintestinal E. coli infections.
In summary, our findings demonstrate the potential for E. coli ST131-H22 to serve as
a foodborne uropathogen. ST131 is just one of many STs that are potentially transmit-
ted from food animals to humans. Therefore, while poultry ST131-H22 may represent
only a small fraction of human infections, the fraction of human extraintestinal disease
due to food animal E. coli may be much higher.

multiple outlets, only one store per chain was sampled.) During the same 12-month period, bacterial
isolates from all positive urine and blood cultures were collected from Flagstaff Medical Center (the main
clinical laboratory servicing northern Arizona). For positive urine and blood cultures from patients
residing within Flagstaff (est. population of 65,870, according to the 2010 U.S. Census), medical records
were reviewed to determine whether the patient had asymptomatic bacteriuria, cystitis, pyelonephritis,
or urosepsis, according to the algorithm in Fig. S1. The Northern Arizona Healthcare IRB approved isolate
collection and medical record review (protocol number 573857-4) with a waiver of consent.
E. coli recovery from retail meats and human urine and blood cultures. E. coli was recovered from
meat products in the research laboratory using enrichment methods as described previously (60). Up to
four putative E. coli isolates per sample were identified and purified on HardyCHROM UTI agar (Hardy
Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA, USA). One E. coli isolate per positive sample was selected at random for
subsequent analysis.
E. coli urine and blood isolates were recovered in the clinical laboratory using standard techniques.
Briefly, urine specimens were collected by midstream clean catch or straight catheterization and cultured
on sheep blood and MacConkey agars within 2 h of collection or with refrigeration for up to 24 h. A
positive urine culture was defined as �104 CFU per ml of urine for clean catch or �103 CFU/ml for straight
catheterization specimens. Species determination was done using the BD Phoenix instrument (Becton,
Dickinson Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD, USA).
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The susceptibility of meat isolates to ampicillin, ampicillin-
sulbactam, cefazolin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline was determined by disk diffusion in accordance with procedures and
breakpoints recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (61). The susceptibility of
clinical isolates to the same agents was determined using the BD Phoenix instrument per the manufac-
turer’
s instructions. In the subsequent analysis, intermediate isolates were classified as resistant, and
isolates resistant to �3 drug classes were classified as multidrug resistant.
Multilocus sequence typing. As part of a larger study on foodborne Enterobacteriaceae, isolates
were subjected to whole-genome sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq system (Illumina, San Diego, CA)
(60). All Illumina DNA sequence libraries used in this study are available on the NCBI Sequence Read
Archive (accession number PRJNA407956). Resultant sequences were analyzed for multilocus sequence
typing (MLST) housekeeping genes by BLAST (v.2.2.25�) (62) at 100% query coverage and nucleotide
identity. Results were matched against an MLST reference database to identify ST131 isolates (63).
fimH typing. Allelic variants of fimH were identified by assembling the Illumina short-read sequences
into contigs by using SPAdes (v.3.5) (64). After quality checks using QUAST (v.2.3) (65), each assembled
genome was compared to an in-house fimH allele reference database using BLASTN (v.2.2.25�) (66). fimH
allele assignments were made based on 100% query coverage and nucleotide identity.
Whole-genome-based phylogenetic analysis. To determine the genetic relatedness of E. coli ST131
human clinical and meat isolates, SNPs from the core genome were used to construct a maximum
likelihood phylogeny for all ST131 isolates. Briefly, using the NASP pipeline (v.1.0.0) (67), Illumina
short-read sequences were aligned to a published ST131 chromosome (strain JJ1887; GenBank accession
number CP014316) (68) by using BWA-MEM (v.0.7.12) (69), and SNPs were called using GATK (v.3.5) (70).
After removing recombinant regions using Gubbins (v.2.1) (71), the resultant SNP matrices were used to
construct phylogenetic trees in PhyML with Smart Model selection (v.3.0) (72), and support values were
calculated by bootstrap sampling (n � 100). Reads from ST131-H22 isolates were aligned to a published
ST131-H22 chromosome (strain SaT040; GenBank accession number CP014495) (73) and were analyzed
as described above.
ColV plasmid profiling. Partially assembled FUTI genomes were compared to a published avian ColV
plasmid (A2363 pAPEC-O2-ColV; GenBank accession number NC_007675) using nucleotide-nucleotide
BLAST (v.2.2.25�) (66). Hits were determined with a � 90% cutoff for similarity and �95% length
coverage with a maximum gap size of 5 and a maximum of 2 gaps. An isolate was considered ColV
plasmid positive if it had at least one gene from four or more of the following sets: (i) cvaABC and cvi (the
ColV operon), (ii) iroBCDEN (the salmochelin operon), (iii) iucABCD and iutA (the aerobactin operon), (iv)
etsABC, (v) ompT and hlyF, and (vi) sitABCD.
Coalescence-based analyses. To investigate the emergence of ColV plasmids across the ST131-H22
lineage, a temporal analysis was performed on the ST131-H22 isolates from Flagstaff (n � 49) and a
global collection of all available ST131-H22 genome sequences, as identified on 1 April 2017 at the
EnteroBase repository (n � 91) (http://enterobase.warwick.ac.uk), which included information on collec-
tion year, source, and location (Data Set S1). To reduce distortion of the analysis by recombination, an
SNP matrix was generated against ST131-H22 reference strain SaT040 as outlined above, followed by
purging using Gubbins (v.2.1) (71) to obtain 3,774 core SNPs. Using BEAST (v.1.8.4) (74), the date of
emergence of the H22 lineage and its distinctive ColV-positive sublineages was estimated. Briefly, the
data were analyzed using the GTR and HKY substitution models with gamma-distributed among-site rate
variation, with four rate categories. Both strict and relaxed molecular clock types were evaluated, as were
the following coalescent tree priors: constant size, exponential growth, and Bayesian Skyline. The
marginal likelihood for each model was estimated by using Tracer (v.1.5) (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/
software/tracer/) with Bayes factors. For each analysis, two independent runs of 500 million steps were
performed, with sampling every 50,000th generation. The first 10% of each chain was discarded as
burn-in. The Markov chain Monte Carlo samples were summarized using the maximum clade credibility
topology by using TreeAnnotator v.1.8.4 from the BEAST package.

 Phylogenetic placement of colistin-resistant E. coli ST131-H22. Two ST131-H22 isolates from the
Danish national surveillance program at Statens Serum Institut were identified retrospectively as carrying
mobile colistin resistance determinants (mcr-1 and mcr-3) (40, 41). Using the above-described methods,
these isolates were screened for ColV plasmids and were analyzed for their phylogenetic placement
within the global ST131-H22 collection.
Statistical analysis. Associations between ColV plasmids and antibiotic resistance phenotypes were
assessed based on odds ratios (ORs) and a two-tailed Fisher’
s exact test. Patient age was compared using
a two-tailed t test with unequal variance. Patient sex and the prevalence of each UTI diagnosis were
compared across fimH types by using a two-tailed Fisher’
s exact test. A P value of �0.05 was considered
statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed in R (v.2.14.2) (75).
