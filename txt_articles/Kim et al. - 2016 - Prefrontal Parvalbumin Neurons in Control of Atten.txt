SUMMARY
While signatures of attention have been extensively
studied in sensory systems, the neural sources and
computations responsible for top-down control of
attention are largely unknown. Using chronic record-
ings in mice, we found that fast-spiking parvalbu-
min (FS-PV) interneurons in medial prefrontal cortex
(mPFC) uniformly show increased and sustained
firing
during
goal-driven
attentional
processing,
correlating to the level of attention. Elevated activity
of FS-PV neurons on the timescale of seconds pre-
dicted successful execution of behavior. Successful
allocation of attention was characterized by strong
synchronization of FS-PV neurons, increased gamma
oscillations, and phase locking of pyramidal firing.
Phase-locked pyramidal neurons showed gamma-
phase-dependent rate modulation during success-
ful attentional processing. Optogenetic silencing of
FS-PV neurons deteriorated attentional processing,
while optogenetic synchronization of FS-PV neurons
at gamma frequencies had pro-cognitive effects and
improved goal-directed behavior. FS-PV neurons
thus act as a functional unit coordinating the activity
in the local mPFC circuit during goal-driven atten-
tional processing.
INTRODUCTION
Attention plays a crucial role in our ability to organize thoughts
and actions in meaningful behavior. On a neurophysiological
level, attention biases processing of certain neural representa-
tions at the expense of others. As a result, behaviorally relevant
information is amplified, while distracting or irrelevant informa-
tion is suppressed (Noudoost et al., 2010). The prefrontal cortex
(PFC) directly influences attentional processing (Baluch and Itti,
2011; Clark et al., 2015; Gregoriou et al., 2014; Miller and Busch-
man, 2013; Moore and Armstrong, 2003; Zhang et al., 2014), but
the local computations underlying PFC’s control of attention
have not been established. Cortical inhibitory interneurons
expressing parvalbumin (PV) are powerful regulators of local
network activities (Hu et al., 2014), and synchronous activation
of PV neurons is sufficient for induction of gamma oscillations
(30–80 Hz) (Buzsa
´ ki and Wang, 2012; Cardin et al., 2009; Sohal
et al., 2009). PV neurons in sensory areas contribute to the signa-
tures of attention through local modulation of sensory responses
(Atallah et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2012; Wilson et al., 2012),
including through the expression of gamma oscillations (Siegle
et al., 2014). Importantly, attentional processing is characterized
by increases in gamma activity, both in sensory as well as pre-
frontal areas (Gregoriou et al., 2014) (Gregoriou et al., 2015).
Activity of cortical PV neurons is not only essential for microcir-
cuit operations but does also correlates to behavioral events
(Isomura et al., 2009; Kvitsiani et al., 2013), and recent findings
suggest that prefrontal PV neurons can act as a functional unit
able to orchestrate the flow of information in and between brain
areas (Courtin et al., 2014; Kepecs and Fishell, 2014). Given the
functional repertoire of PV neurons, it is not surprising that this
neuronal cell type repetitively has been implicated in a variety
of neurological and psychiatric diseases (Marı
´n, 2012). The links
are especially strong in schizophrenia, a disabling mental disor-
der with well-defined impairments in the control of attention
(Lustig et al., 2013). Patients with schizophrenia demonstrate
impairment in visual search when top-down goals are required,
showing a selective deficit in top-down control of attention
(Gold et al., 2007). Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are sug-
gested to emerge from impaired prefrontal gamma oscillations
(Lewis et al., 2012), and the key role of PV neurons in the gener-
ation of cortical gamma oscillations links this neuronal class to
cognitive deficits (Carle
´ n et al., 2012; Korotkova et al., 2010).
Despite many intersecting lines of circumstantial evidence,
proof for a function of inhibitory medial PFC (mPFC) PV neurons
in the control of attention is lacking. Moreover, it is yet to be
demonstratedhowcortical PVneuronsrelatetogammaactivityin
attention and how prefrontal gamma oscillations could contribute
to the behavioral benefits of attention. Elucidation of the circuit
underpinnings of top-down control of attention will not only give
answers to central questions regarding how PFC contributes to
purposeful behavior, but will also give insight on how circuit dis-
turbances could underlie symptomatology in mental disorders
characterized by altered cognition.

 RESULTS
Identification and Recording of mPFC Neurons during
Top-Down Control of Attention
To characterize the recruitment and firing modulation of mPFC
neurons during attentional processing, we conducted chronic
electrophysiological recordings in mice performing a three-
choice version of the five-choice serial reaction time task
(5-CSRTT) (Robbins, 2002). The 5-CSRTT is a widely employed
rodent attention task, building on tests of sustained attention
originally developed for humans, and is identified as having
high construct validity (Lustig et al., 2013). In the task, animals
are required to orient to an array of stimulus presentation holes
in an operant chamber and to allocate attention to detect and
report the location of a brief visual stimulus (cue) presented pseu-
dorandomly in one of three presentation holes (Figure S1A and
Movie S1). The animals were subjected to a six-step training
schedule defined by specific criteria (modified from Bari et al.
[2008]) (Figures S1B–S1F) to fully learn the task (n = 28 ± 8 training
days for all animals used, n = 13 PV-Cre mice). After meeting the
target criteria, three PV-Cre mice were implanted with micro-
drives holding four movable tetrodes targeted to prelimbic
(PL) and infralimbic (IL) cortex (Figures S2A–S2C), and 426 well-
isolated neurons were recorded during 3-CSRTT (54 sessions,
3,857 trials in total). As a first step, we classified the recorded
units into narrow-spiking (NS; n = 70, half-valley width 252 ±
36 ms) putative inhibitory interneurons and wide-spiking (WS;
n = 329, half-valley width 428 ± 37 ms) putative pyramidal neurons
basedonspikewaveformfeatures(Starketal.,2013;FigureS2D).
Units with low classification confidence (p > 0.05, n = 27) were not
classified. The waveform classification revealed three potential
NS clusters, and the units were therefore further classified based
on firing rate (Figure S2E). This parameter identified a population
of fast-spiking NS neurons, and NS units with an average firing
rate > 10 Hz were classified as FS-PV neurons (n = 30, mean firing
rate 18 ± 6 Hz, all data from all trials). Inhibitory interactions and
short-latency suppression of WS spiking were confirmed for
21 of the 30 FS-PV neurons in computed cross-correlograms
(Fujisawa et al., 2008; see further below).
Optogenetics enables verification of physiology-based classi-
fication of neurons recorded in vivo (Kvitsiani et al., 2013; Roux
et al., 2014), and we therefore paired chronic extracellular re-
cordings with optical tagging of FS-PV neurons in freely moving
animals (n = 4 PV-Cre mice, 46 opto-tagging sessions). An
adeno-associated virus expressing channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)
(Cardin et al., 2009) was targeted to mPFC to render PV neu-
rons sensitive to blue light (Figure 1A). Application of blue light
(473 nm, 5 mW, 3–5 ms light pulses, 10–90 Hz) elicited short-
latency action potentials in ChR2-expressing FS-PV neurons fol-
lowed by inhibition of WS neurons recorded on the same tetrode
(Figures 1B and 1C), demonstrating efficient temporal control
of FS-PV neuron activity during active behavior. Using stim-
ulus-associated spike latency test (SALT) in combination with a
spike-shape correlation measure (Kvitsiani et al., 2013), we
confirmed that the 12 units optically tagged and recorded were
directly light-driven FS-PV neurons (Figure 1D). Comparison of
the electrophysiological properties between NS neurons re-
corded during 3-CSRTT and FS-PV neurons identified through
opto-tagging confirmed that our physiological classification
correctly categorized FS-PV neurons (Figures 1E–1G).

 cue location within a defined time span; Movie S4) are scored as
errors and are considered to reflect disturbances in attentional
processing and executive functioning (Robbins, 2002). To in-
crease the attentional load and prevent self-pacing strategies
for prediction of stimulus onset, we employed pseudorandom
delays (‘‘delay’’ refers to time from trial start to cue onset) with
the cue being presented 3, 4, or 5 s after trial start, on a trial-
to-trial basis (‘‘event onset asynchrony’’).
We focused our examination of the responses of the recorded
FS-PV and WS populations to the delay (i.e., when attention is
allocated [Totah et al., 2009, 2013; Figure S1A]). The firing rate
modulation was analyzed based on the behavioral outcome
(correct, incorrect, or omitted response). Premature responses
cancel cue presentation, and we therefore did not perform anal-
ysis of recordings from trials with this type of error. Trial start was
reported by an increase in FS-PV activity, independent of behav-
ioral outcome (Figure 2A). However, in trials with correct report of
cue location, the FS-PV neurons uniformly displayed a sustained
enhancement of firing during the delay compared to trials with
incorrect report or omission (Figures 2A–2D). Already 300 ms

 after trial start, the FS-PV activity was significantly higher in cor-
rect trials compared to error trials (incorrect + omission). It was
thus possible, based on the level of the FS-PV activity, to predict
successful behavior (i.e., correct response) more than 2.5 s
before cue onset (p < 0.05, paired t test, example from shortest
delay [3 s]). As a population, the FS-PV neurons showed a
remarkably homogenous firing rate modulation during the delay
preceding a successful behavioral response (Figure 2B), with up
to 40% of the neurons displaying significantly elevated firing
rates in correct trials (Figure S3A). As a whole, the FS-PV activity
was modulated by attention (Figure 2E).
Analysis of the firing rate of the WS population (n = 329) re-
vealed only minor modulations throughout the delay, regardless
of behavioral outcome (Figure 2F). Yet, the elevated FS-PV firing
is expected to exert pronounced inhibitory effects on local WS
spiking (Hu et al., 2014; Roux and Buzsa
´ ki, 2015). In support of
this, we found a high prevalence of short-latency inhibitory puta-
tive monosynaptic interactions between FS and WS neurons in
computed cross-correlograms (Fujisawa et al., 2008), identifying
functional connectivity between the cell types and FS-PV sup-
pression of WS spiking (Figure S3B). We therefore next analyzed
the firing rate modulation during the delay of correct trials for
each WS neuron individually (Figures 2G and S3C). Interestingly,
this revealed a clear dissociation of the WS population, with
61% of the WS neurons showing elevated activity and 39% sup-
pressed activity (Figures 2G and 2H). Mixed modulation of mPFC
activity during attentional processing has been observed in
the 3- and 5-CSRTT in earlier studies, in which the recorded
neurons were not classified into cell types (Donnelly et al.,
2015; Totah et al., 2009). Importantly, the WS sub-population
with
enhanced
activity
in
correct
trials
displayed
lower
firing rates in error trials (Gregoriou et al., 2014; Figure 2H).
Conversely, the WS subpopulation with suppressed activity in
correct trials was less suppressed in error trials (Figure 2H). In
line with this, the strongest and fastest inhibition by FS-PV neu-
rons was seen in correct trials, targeting the WS sub-population
with suppressed activity (trough at 3 ms in correct trials and 4 ms
in error trials for WS neurons with suppressed activity; Fig-
ure S3D). Taken together, WS neurons showed mixed activities
during attentional processing (Figures 2I and S3E), but the WS
activity as a whole was not modulated by attention (Figure 2J).
The response latency (i.e., the reaction time: time from cue
onset to nose-poke response) correlated to trial outcome,
corroborating previous findings (Totah et al., 2009), with faster
responses in correct trials compared to incorrect trials (correct:
1.7 ± 0.3 s; incorrect: 2.1 ± 0.5 s, p < 0.01, paired t test), even dur-
ing training (Figure S1F). Interestingly, there was no correlation
between the reaction time and the FS-PV activity directly before
cue onset in correct trials (i.e., the time point when the animals
most urgently must allocate attention in order to not miss the
presentation of the cue [Figure 3A]). Further, the pattern of FS-
PV activity was indistinguishable between correct trials with
fast and slow reaction times (Figure 3B). These findings suggest
that the recorded FS-PV activity does not correlate to general
task engagement (Hayden et al., 2009) or motor preparation. In
support of this, the FS-PV activity was modulated differently in
correct and incorrect trials with very similar reaction times (i.e.,
although the behavioral responses were performed with very
similar latencies, the FS-PV activity clearly reflected the respec-
tive trial type’s level of attention and predicted the outcome of
the behavior [Figure 3C]).
Analysis of the latency to collect reward after correct re-
sponses (reward collection latency, RL; Figure S1A) provides
a sensitive control measure of motivation, with longer reward
latencies reflecting lowered motivation (Robbins, 2002). We
found that the FS-PV activity during attentional processing in
correct trails with fast reward latencies was not different from
the activity in correct trials with slow reward latencies, arguing
against the recorded FS-PV activity being a correlate of the moti-
vational state of the animal (Figure 3D). Collectively, these find-
ings lend support to the interpretation that elevated and sus-
tained mPFC FS-PV delay activity is a correlate of successful
attentional processing.
Error or reward processing could potentially influence the
neuronal activity in a subsequent trial, and we therefore investi-
gated how the FS-PV activity during the delay was affected by

 the outcome of previous behavior (i.e., if the previous trial was re-
warded or not). The level of FS-PV activity during thedelay oftrials
with correct responses was very similar, regardless of whether
the previous trial was rewarded or not, with the distinction that
the elevation of activity came significantly earlier if the previous
trial had been rewarded (p < 0.01, paired t test; Figure S4). This
suggests that the consequence of the animal’s previous behavior
does not affect the level of recruitment of mPFC FS-PV neurons
but possibly influences the timing of recruitment.
Successful Allocation of Attention Is Characterized by
Synchronization of mPFC FS-PV and WS Neurons and
Enhanced Gamma Oscillations
Allocation of attention is correlated to enhancement of gamma
synchronization in PFC (Gregoriou et al., 2009, 2015), and it
has been proposed that oscillations in the gamma range benefit
cortical processing and behavior (Fries, 2009; Pritchett et al.,
2015). Analysis of the local field potential (LFP) revealed distinct
bouts of spontaneously occurring gamma during the delay in tri-
als with correct responses (Figure 4A). The 30–40 Hz gamma ac-
tivity was significantly elevated in correct trials compared to trials
with omitted responses. Trials with incorrect report of cue loca-
tion showed intermediate levels of gamma activity, possibly re-
flecting the notion that attention is indeed engaged in incorrect
trials, but not sufficiently to support correct report of the cue
location (Totah et al., 2009; Figures 4B–4D). Importantly, the
gamma amplitude did not differ between trial types directly after
termination of the delay (i.e., the elevation of gamma in correct
trials was specific to the time point when attention was allocated
[Figures 4D and 4E]).
Optogenetics has provided causative in vivo evidence for the
crucial role of FS-PV neurons in the emergence of cortical
gamma oscillations; ChR2 drive of FS-PV neurons at gamma
frequencies entrain naturalistic gamma in the local in vivo cir-
cuit (Cardin et al., 2009; Siegle et al., 2014; Sohal et al.,
2009). To infer whether gamma activity coupled to attention
depends on synchronous firing of mPFC FS-PV neurons, we
investigated the alignment and level of phase locking of FS-
PV firing during the last 2 seconds of the delay. The FS-PV
population was significantly phase locked (Vinck et al., 2013)
and fired in the same phase (the trough) of the gamma cycle
in all types of trials, with strongest phase locking in correct tri-
als (i.e., during successful allocation of attention characterized
by elevated gamma activity [Figure 4F]). Selective investigation
of significantly phase-locked FS-PV neurons revealed a strong
phase concentration of the spiking in the trough of the gamma
cycle (Siegle et al., 2014) in correct trials (Figure 4G). This pro-
nounced synchronous FS-PV firing was followed by a period of
suppressed local WS firing (Figures 4H and 4I). Further, in cor-
rect trials, the WS firing became significantly phase locked
to gamma (Figures 4H and 4I). This characteristic pattern and
alignment of FS-PV phase-locking are consistent with the dy-
namics of FS-PV-driven gamma (Pritchett et al., 2015 but see
Buzsa
´ ki and Wang, 2012). Taken together, successful alloca-
tion of attention was characterized by gamma-rhythmic inhibi-
tion by FS-PV neurons, increased temporal precision of WS
firing, and synchronization of WS firing (Hasenstaub et al.,
2005).
Differential Attentional Modulation of WS Neurons
Phase Locked to Local Gamma
A closer look at the phase distributions revealed that WS neurons
phase locked to gamma during successful allocation of attention
(i.e., in correct trials) preferentially fired in either the trough or at
the peak of the gamma cycle (Figure 4I). In addition to temporally
sharpening WS responses (Cardin et al., 2009; Hasenstaub et al.,
2005) and increasing synchronization, gamma-rhythmic inhi-
bition by FS-PV neurons is implicated in gating of inputs and in
gain control (Tiesinga et al., 2004, 2008), with the phase of
gamma influencing the efficacy by which excitatory inputs drive
local WS responses (Womelsdorf et al., 2014). Optogenetic ex-
periments have shown that synaptic inputs arriving in the trough
of gamma (i.e., when the level of inhibition is lowest) evoke
enhanced responses of local WS neurons, while inputs arriving
in the opposite phase evoke diminished responses (Cardin
et al., 2009; Siegle et al., 2014). To directly investigate a potential
relationship between endogenous gamma activity and re-
sponses of local mPFC WS neurons during attention, we selec-
tively analyzed the firing rates during the delay of the WS neurons
significantly phase locked to the trough or the peak of the
gamma cycle in correct trials (Figures 5A and 5B). Interestingly,
this separated the WS neurons into two sub-populations, with
WS neurons discharging in the trough of gamma displaying
increased firing and WS neurons discharging at the peak dis-
playing suppressed firing (Figure 5C).
Top-Down Control of Attention Relies on FS-PV Activity
The strong network and behavioral correlate of mPFC FS-PV
activities imply a functional role of this population in top-down
control of attention and goal-directed behavior. In order to
directly address this hypothesis, we employed optogenetic
silencing of the FS-PV neurons during the delay. Light-activated
inhibiting chloride-conducting channels were recently devel-
oped through structure-guided transformation of an originally
cation-conducting channelrhodopsin (Berndt et al., 2014). Inhib-
itory channels hold several advantages over the traditionally
used inhibitory pumps, including a more physiological inhibition
of action potentials. SwiChR is a fast and bistable inhibitory step-
function channel that can be used for inhibition of neuronal
spiking for seconds (Berndt et al., 2014). Brief blue light applica-
tion results in stable inhibition that can be terminated by appli-
cation of red-shifted light. To confirm the bistable inhibitory
action of SwiChR in vivo, we performed recordings in prelim-
bic/infralimbic cortex of PV-Cre mice injected with AAV DIO
SwiChR-EYFP (n = 4 PV-Cre mice; Figure S5A). Blue light appli-
cation (1 s, 473 nm, 5 mW) inhibited FS-PV spiking, resulting in
disinhibition of neurons in the local circuit for several seconds,
which could be counteracted by application of red light (1 s,
638 nm, 5 mW; Figures S5B–S5D). We expressed SwiChR bilat-
erally in mPFC PV neurons (Figures 6A and 6B) in trained ani-
mals (n = 5 PV-Cre mice) and pseudorandomly silenced the
mPFC PV neurons’ activity during the delay in 50% of the trials
(total number of trials: 4,362). In separate sessions, 0.5, 1.0, or
2.0 s pulses of blue light (473 nm, 5 or 7 mW) were used (for
experimental outline, see Figure S1A). Inhibition of FS-PV activ-
ity was terminated with 1 s of red light (638 nm; 5 mW) directly
after the delay in all trials with SwiChR application. In essence,

 we ensured that inhibition of FS-PV spiking matched the tempo-
ral pattern of elevated FS-PV activity during successful alloca-
tion of attention.
Inhibition of FS-PV neurons during attentional processing
resulted in more than a doubling of the total number of errors
(premature + incorrect + omission), regardless of blue light-pulse
duration (p < 0.01, paired t test; Figure 6C). The major effect seen
was a large increase in the number of omitted trials (p < 0.01,
paired t test; Figures 6D and S6A). Omissions can reflect inatten-
tiveness, particularly in mice, which are prone to withhold a
response after failure to attend to the stimulus (Amitai and Mar-
kou, 2010). To investigate this further, we analyzed deficits in
other domains. Analysis of the latency to collect reward after
correct responses revealed that SwiChR silencing of mPFC
FS-PV neurons did not affect reward latencies, independent of
blue light-pulse duration and power intensity (Figures S6B and
S6C), arguing against a general effect on internal motivation
(Robbins, 2002).
Increased omissions could theoretically be attributed to
deficits in motor activity (Robbins, 2002). Deficits in motor activ-
ity would be expected to be consistent in trials with SwiChR acti-
vation and, thus, independent of trial outcome, and we therefore
analyzed the response latency (i.e., the reaction time) for correct
responses. SwiChR application did not result in increased
response latencies in correct trials with light application
compared to correct trials without light, independent of blue-
light-pulse duration and light intensity (Figures S6D and S6E).
Together, these findings lend support to the notion that silencing
of mPFC FS-PV activities during the delay selectively disrupts
attentional processing.
Frequency-Dependent FS-PV Modulation of Attention
Optogenetic activation of cortical PV neurons has been em-
ployed in many studies investigating cortical computations
(for review, see Hangya et al., 2014; Kepecs and Fishell, 2014;
Roux et al., 2014). Optogenetic drive of FS-PV activity can,
depending on the stimulation paradigm used and the network
operations affected, lead to both perturbation (Sachidhanandam
et al., 2013; Siegle et al., 2014) and enhancement (Lee et al.,
2012; Siegle et al., 2014) of ongoing network activities and,
ultimately, influence behavior (Pritchett et al., 2015). To directly
investigate how synchronization of FS-PV firing at different
frequencies influences attentional processing, we expressed
ChR2 bilaterally in mPFC FS-PV neurons in a cohort of animals
trained in the 3-CSRTT (n = 5 PV-Cre mice; Figures 7A and
7B). Blue light (473 nm, 3 ms light pulses, 5 or 7 mW) was applied
throughout the pseudorandom delay (3, 4, or 5 s) or during the
last 2 seconds of the delay pseudorandomly in 50% of the trials
(total number of trials: 10,302; for experimental outline, see Fig-
ure S1A). Interestingly, optogenetic activation of FS-PV neurons
at frequencies lower (1–10 Hz) than the native FS-PV activity
displayed in correct trials directly before cue onset (19.25 ±
7.55 Hz, �1 to 0 s before cue onset) resulted in a significant
increase in the total number of errors (premature + incorrect +
omission; p < 0.01 paired t test; Figures 7C and S7A). As with
the use of SwiChR, there was a large increase in the number
of omitted trials (p < 0.01 paired t test; Figures 7D and S7B),
but also the number of premature responses was increased
with light application throughout the delay. Premature re-
sponses are thought to reflect deficits in impulse control, a
PFC-dependent cognitive trait tightly linked to attentional
processing. The negative effect on the behavior implies that
intermittent forced synchronization of FS-PV neurons at low fre-
quencies disrupts ongoing local network activities supporting
attention. Our data further indicate that attention works in con-
cert with response inhibition and that the two functions might
share network underpinnings.
Activation at 20 Hz (i.e., close to the native FS-PV rate dis-
played before the cue in correct trials) did not change the
error rate (p > 0.1, paired t test; Figures 7C, 7D, S7A, and
S7B), indicating that synchronization of FS-PV activity per se
does not disrupt attention. Despite extensive training, the ani-
mals do not correctly report the cue location in 100% of the trials.
The most common error is an omission (Figures 6D and 7D),
which presumably depends on a natural inability to sustain atten-
tion in every trial of a session. Improvement of behavior in the
3-CSRTT is thus possible, which is supported by pharmacolog-
ical studies (Barak and Weiner, 2011). Optogenetic gamma drive
of FS-PV neurons in barrel cortex was recently shown to
enhance sensory perception (Siegle et al., 2014), and in line
with this, we next activated the FS-PV neurons at gamma
frequencies. Interestingly, activation of FS-PV neurons at
30–40 Hz during the delay resulted in a decreased rate of errors
(p = 0.01, paired t test; Figure 7C), with a significant decrease in

 the number of omitted responses (p = 0.01 compared to trials
without light, paired t test; Figure 7D), directly demonstrating
that gamma synchronization of mPFC FS-PV neurons benefits
attentional processing.
The pro-cognitive effects of gamma synchronization of FS-PV
neurons were instant, short lasting, and specific to attention.
Long-lasting effects are expected to be carried over to the pseu-
dorandomly intermingled trials without light, but they were not
(Figure 7C). The 30–40 Hz activation of FS-PV neurons did
not affect motivation, as there was no significant difference
in reward collection latencies between correct trials with or
without light, regardless of the time point, power, or frequency
of the light application (Figures S7C–S7E). As with the use of
SwiChR, ChR2 application during the delay did not generate
motor deficits, as the reaction time was not increased in cor-
rect trials with light compared to trials without light (Figures
S7F–S7H).
DISCUSSION
Attention guides behavioral responses by selecting task-relevant
information for further processing, and the signatures of atten-
tion have been extensively studied in sensory systems. Signals
of attention arise in PFC (Baluch and Itti, 2011; Buschman and
Miller, 2007; Li et al., 2010), a central site for executive control
and coordination of goal-driven behavior. Studies in monkeys
have consistently identified PFC as a key site for control of atten-
tion and a source of attentional modulation of neural responses
in downstream brain structures (Clark et al., 2015; Gregoriou
et al., 2014; Miller and Buschman, 2013; Moore and Armstrong,
2003; Rossi et al., 2007). However, the circuit underpinnings and
mechanisms behind PFC’s control of attentional processing
have been largely unknown. More specifically, the computa-
tions by which PFC could communicate behavioral goals and
contribute to selective enhancement of relevant representations
in downstream areas have not been demonstrated. Further, a
causal link between synchronous brain activity in attention and
behavior has been missing (Gregoriou et al., 2015).
mPFC Neural Correlates of Attentional Processing in
Goal-Directed Behavior
Our results firmly establish that mPFC FS-PV neurons are
recruited by attentional processing and that enhanced and
sustained FS-PV spiking predicts successful execution of
goal-directed behavior. This surprisingly uniform modulation of
mPFC FS-PV neurons constitutes a first cell-type-specific neural
correlate of successful allocation of attention. We find that local
WS neurons are separated into populations with suppressed or
enhanced activity during attentional processing and that this
separation is most pronounced during successful allocation of
attention, possibly reflecting selective and optimal mPFC inte-
gration of the neuronal representations needed for achieving
the goal. Our data do not reveal what representations are pro-
cessed nor their cellular sources. The target and its value, the
rules, and the goal of the task engage top-down attention (Clark
et al., 2015) and are suggested representations needed to be
actively maintained in mPFC during task performance.
The Role of Gamma in Attention
We find that successful allocation of attention is accompanied
by elevated mPFC LFP activity in the gamma band and that
elevated gamma is coupled to synchronous firing of FS-PV neu-
rons and gamma-phase-dependent silencing of local WS neu-
rons (Cardin et al., 2009). During enhanced gamma, local WS
firing also became synchronized (Hasenstaub et al., 2005), sup-
porting the view that gamma rhythm provides a means for forma-
tion of assemblies of WS neurons with coordinated firing (Buz-
sa
´ ki and Watson, 2012). Synchronization of pyramidal action
potential firing is a proposed mechanism for how gamma rhyth-
micity could promote the relay of relevant information and drive
firing in the proper targets with higher probability (Buzsa
´ ki and
Watson, 2012; Salinas and Sejnowski, 2000, 2001). This could
directly contribute to the preferential processing of task-relevant
stimuli in downstream areas (Gregoriou et al., 2014) and, ulti-
mately, to the behavioral benefits of attention.
Our data also suggest that the gamma rhythmic inhibition
imposes phase-selective gain modulation of local WS neurons

 during attention, which has been anticipated by modeling and
optogenetic studies (Cardin et al., 2009; Pritchett et al., 2015; Sie-
gle et al., 2014; Tiesinga et al., 2004, 2008). The cycles of strong
FS-PV inhibition create brief time windows with decaying inhibi-
tion in the trough of gamma right before onset of the next gamma
cycle, where WS neurons would be most sensitive to input and
produce maximal output (Womelsdorf et al., 2014). Gamma
rhythmic inhibition thus could enhance the throughput of task-
relevant information both by synchronization of WS firing and
by generating WS output with a higher spike probability. Taken
together, our electrophysiological recordings support the view
that the temporal conditions created by FS-PV firing specifically
in the gamma range support computations underlying top-
down control of attention and cognitive behavior (Fries, 2009).
The Role of mPFC PV-FS Neurons in Attention
Our SwiChR experiments show that silencing of mPFC FS-PV
neurons during attentional processing has detrimental effects
on goal-directed behavior. Based on our electrophysiological
findings, it is conceivable that decreased inhibition by FS-PV
neurons precludes proper gamma rhythmicity and prevents
accurate synchronization and attentional modulation of local
WS firing. As discussed, this is expected to impact the formation
of WS assemblies and the relay to downstream structures.
While the finding of improved behavior with forced synchroni-
zation of mPFC FS-PV neurons at gamma frequencies can
seem surprising, gamma oscillations have long been predicted
to serve cognition (Gray and Singer, 1989), a concept recently
finding direct experimental support. In optogenetic experiments,
gamma drive of FS-PV neurons in PFC had pro-cognitive effects
and could rescue deficits in cognitive flexibility (Cho et al., 2015).
The pro-cognitive effects remained long term, which contrasts
the instant and short-lasting effects in our study. Further, while
Cho et al. (2015) used drive of gamma to rescue cognitive deficits
in a mutant mouse, we demonstrate selective enhancement
of attentional processing in overtrained normal mice. It thus
appears that prefrontal gamma activity can support various
aspects of cognitive processing on multiple timescales and
probably through different circuit operations. It will be important
for future studies to characterize the computations by which
FS-PV gamma mediates particular constructs of cognition and
under what contingencies.
The demonstration of frequency-dependent FS-PV modula-
tion of attentional processing is conceptually important for our
understanding of how synchronous brain activity can support
cognition. This finding also agrees with the idea that oscillations
are appropriate targets for investigation of pathophysiology of
mental disorders characterized by changed cognition (Buzsa
´ ki
and Watson, 2012) and, more specifically, that PV neurons
play a key role in psychiatry (Hu et al., 2014). The pro-cognitive
effects of synchronization of FS-PV neurons at gamma fre-
quencies suggest that cell-type-specific manipulations can be
used for enhancement of cortical computations and cognition.
This concept is very encouraging, but it also underscores that,
in order to understand the operations of the brain, we need to
understand the component cells by their functions.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Mice were trained in the 3-CSRTT to attend to and report the location of a brief
visual cue presented pseudorandomly in one of three cue/nose-poking holes
(Figure S1A). To increase the attentional load, the cue was presented with pseu-
dorandom delays (3, 4, or 5 s) after trial start. Nose-poking into the correct hole
resulted in immediate access to reward, while incorrect reports, premature re-
ports, and omitted responses were unrewarded and scored as errors, resulting
in a 5 s timeout during which a new trial could not be initiated. Fully trained ani-
mals were implanted with microdrives holding tetrodes targeted to mPFC, and
chronic recordings were performed over a large number of 3-CSRTT trials for
characterization of the recruitment and firing modulation of mPFC neurons
during attentional processing. Cell-type classification of local FS-PV and WS
neurons was performed by electrophysiological characterizations, and the clas-
sification of FS-PV neurons was verified with opto-tagging using ChR2 in freely
moving animals. The activity patterns of FS-PV and WS neurons, respectively,
were aligned to trial start and cue presentation, and the correlation between

 the firing modulation and attentional processing was investigated. To examine
population activity, peri-event time histograms (PETHs) for each unit were
normalized in Z score and averaged across different trials (correct, incorrect,
and omission). For examination of how the activities of the FS-PV and WS pop-
ulations were modulated by attention, we calculated the attentional modulation
index (AMI) 1 s before cue onset. To identify inhibitory putative monosynaptic
connections from FS-PV to WS cells, we calculated cross-correlations of spike
trains for pairs of simultaneously recorded neurons across correct and error tri-
als. To investigate changes in the power of the LFP during attention and presen-
tation of the cue, respectively, the relative power for different frequency bands
wascalculatedandcomparedbetweentrialtypes.Toinvestigatetherelationship
between single-unit activity and LFPs, we performed spike-LFP phase-locking
analysis for correct, incorrect, and omitted trials. Todetermine the instantaneous
phase angle of unit spikes relative to gamma oscillations, the phase vector of the
filtered LFP was estimated, and the significance of spike-LFP phase locking was
tested using circularstatistics. The degree ofphaselocking was evaluated bythe
length of the mean resultant vector (MRL, range 0–1) and the concentration
parameter (k). Cohorts of fully trained animals were injected with adeno-associ-
ated viruses encoding ChR2 or SwiChR for optogenetic in vivo manipulation of
FS-PV activity during attentional processing. Light (5 or 7 mW) was delivered
pseudorandomly in 50% of the trials of each session. For SwiChR, 0.5, 1.0, or
2.0 s of blue 473 nm light was delivered at trial start and 1.0 s of red 638 nm light
directly after termination of the delay. For ChR2, blue light was applied
throughout the delay or during the last 2 s of the delay. The inhibitory action of
SwiChR was confirmed withacute recordingswith silicon probesinanesthetized
animals. Statistical differences were determined by paired t tests and ANOVA
with repeated measures (for the effects of optogenetic manipulations). More de-
tails are given in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
