Abstract
Background—Cocaine addiction is characterized by patterns of compulsive drug-taking, 
including preoccupation with obtaining cocaine and loss of control over drug intake. The lateral 
hypothalamic hypocretin/orexin (HCRT) system has been implicated in drug-taking and the 
reinstatement of drug-seeking. Evidence suggests HCRT may drive drug-seeking through 
activation of specific brain regions implicated in stress system dysfunction, including the central 
amygdala (CeA). The role of HCRT in the persistence of compulsive-like cocaine-taking has yet to 
be fully elucidated.
Methods—Systemic and intra-CeA microinfusions of the HCRT-receptor 1 antagonist, 
SB-334867, were administered to rats allowed either short (1 h; ShA) or long (6 h; LgA) access to 
cocaine self-administration. Animals were tested for fixed and progressive ratio responding for 
cocaine and stress-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking. Additionally, using electrophysiological 
techniques on in vitro slices, we investigated GABAergic neurotransmission in the medial CeA 
and the sensitivity of GABAergic synapses to modulation of the HCRT system in ShA or LgA rats
Results—We found systemic administration of SB-334867 (0, 7.5, 15, 30 mg/kg) dose-
dependently decreased cocaine intake specifically in LgA, but not in ShA, rats. Microinjections of 
SB-334867 (20 nmol) bilaterally into the CeA significantly reduced cocaine intake in LgA rats. 
We also observed a significant attenuation of yohimbine-induced reinstatement of cocaine-seeking 
following intra-CeA SB-334867 (10 nmol) administration. Finally, electrophysiological data

Introduction
Psychostimulants, including cocaine, are widely-abused drugs that exert robust reinforcing 
and arousal-enhancing effects, contributing to their use and abuse. Cocaine addiction is a 
disorder in which both humans and animals ultimately transition from nondependent, 
episodic drug use to compulsive drug-taking. Compulsive-like behavior in humans (1) and 
rodents (2; 3) is characterized by excessive drug-seeking/taking patterns that are difficult to 
terminate once responding has been initiated. Compulsive-like behavior in rats is 
operationally defined as the emergence of escalated drug intake, increased motivation to 
obtain the drug (i.e. elevated progressive ratio breakpoints), responding despite punishment, 
reward system deficits during abstinence and increased likelihood of relapse (2–6). Animal 
models of extended access (≥ 6 hours) to cocaine self-administration mimic compulsive-like 
behavioral patterns, maintaining face and construct validity for the transition to drug 
dependence (7; 8). The escalated cocaine intake and increased progressive ratio breakpoints 
that are observed in long access (LgA; 6 h) animals is in contrast to lower, stable intake 
observed in animals allowed short access (ShA; 1 h) to cocaine (7; 9). It is hypothesized that 
escalated cocaine-taking is partially mediated by upregulation of brain motivational and 
stress systems, particularly within extended amygdala subregions including the central 
amygdala (CeA), the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the medial and caudal 
nucleus accumbens (NAc; 7). Escalated cocaine intake is also associated with a significant 
blunting of the dopamine response to cocaine and an increase in intracranial self-stimulation 
reward thresholds that imply reduced rewarding effects of drugs over time (4; 11). Thus, 
under conditions of extended cocaine access, it is posited that brain stress systems are 
recruited and sensitized with concomitant reward system deficits and the drug is taken to 
alleviate negative emotional states associated with these dynamic allostatic changes (10).
Over the past decade, the lateral hypothalamus, largely via the hypocretin/orexin (HCRT) 
neuropeptide system, has been implicated in both stress and reward-seeking across many 
drug classes, including cocaine (12; 13). Despite limited cell numbers in the lateral 
hypothalamus, HCRT neurons project widely throughout the brain, targeting two G-protein-
coupled receptors referred to as HCRT-receptor 1 and 2 (HCRT-R1 and -R2, respectively). 
These receptors have varying affinities for HCRT peptide ligands such that HCRT-1 peptide 
binds to both receptors, whereas HCRT-2 peptide binds selectively to HCRT-R2. HCRT 
neuronal projections include reciprocal connections to the extended amygdala, including the 
CeA, and other basal forebrain regions (14–16) implicated in the stress surfeit component of 
addiction. To date, HCRT-R1 signaling has been shown to mediate reinforcement of all

 major drug classes, including psychostimulants, nicotine, alcohol and opioids. However, 
HCRT-R1 antagonism has yielded no or limited effects on low-effort, fixed ratio (FR1) 
responding for cocaine self-administration (17–19), particularly in animals allowed ShA to 
the drug. Nonetheless, HCRT-R1 antagonism readily blocks stress-induced reinstatement of 
cocaine-seeking, while central HCRT-1 administration reinstates previously extinguished 
drug-seeking (20–22). The participation of HCRT in stress-related drug-seeking is not 
surprising given HCRT neurotransmission has been implicated in stress and high-arousal 
conditions in both humans and animals (12; 23; 24). These observations suggest that HCRT 
not only plays a significant role in maintaining the hyper-aroused state needed for cocaine-
seeking, but also contributes to highly motivated compulsive-like cocaine-seeking. 
Consistent with this hypothesis, HCRT-R1 antagonists attenuate effortful, compulsive-like 
responding under a progressive ratio (PR) schedule (18; 25) and at higher FR schedules (e.g. 
FR5; 16). The current experiments sought to test the hypothesis that HCRT modulates 
compulsive-like cocaine-taking associated with LgA. We hypothesized that HCRT stress 
systems are recruited during compulsive-like drug-taking, and that blocking HCRT 
neurotransmission within the CeA would reduce compulsive-like cocaine-taking and 
attenuate stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine-seeking in LgA rats.
Previous studies demonstrate that extended access to cocaine self-administration alters 
plasticity at gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic synapses within the medial CeA (27). 
We further hypothesized that dysregulated HCRT activity in the CeA contributes to the 
development or maintenance of negative emotional states associated with cocaine 
withdrawal via enhancement of GABAergic transmission. There is little evidence regarding 
the interaction between HCRT and GABAergic neurotransmission in the CeA of animals 
allowed extended cocaine access. Thus, we used in vitro electrophysiological techniques to 
measure spontaneous GABAergic transmission and the effects of HCRT stimulation and 
antagonism in CeA neurons from ShA and LgA rats compared with cocaine-naïve controls. 
We hypothesized that LgA rats would exhibit increased sponanteous GABAergic 
transmission in the CeA, and that this increased GABAergic transmission would be blocked 
by HCRT-receptor antagonism.
Combined, the results from our behavioral and electrophysiological studies demonstrate that 
HCRT within the CeA is dysregulated following LgA to cocaine and support a role for 
HCRT in the neuroplasticity associated with cocaine addiction.
Material and Methods
Animals
Adult male Wistar rats (N=56; Charles River, Raleigh, NC), weighing 225–275 g at the 
beginning of the experiments, were group housed in a temperature-controlled (22°C) 
vivarium on a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle (lights off at 08:00 h) with ad libitum access to food 
and water. Behavioral testing occurred once per day during the dark/active cycle. Animals 
acclimated to the facility for at least 7 days before surgery. All procedures adhered to the 
National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were 
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of The Scripps Research 
Institute or the National Institute on Drug Abuse Intramural Research Program.

 Surgery
Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (1.5–2.5%) and prepared with chronic indwelling 
jugular vein catheters as previously described (5). Catheters were flushed daily with 
heparinized sterile saline (0.2 ml; 30 USP units/ml). Following self-administration training, 
a subset of rats underwent stereotaxic surgery under isoflurane anesthesia, and were 
implanted bilaterally with 23-gauge cannulae (Plastics One, Roanoke, VA) aimed at the CeA 
(flathead; A/P −2.4, M/L ±4.2, V/D −6.0, mm relevant to bregma). Cannulae were cemented 
into position using acrylic resin (Lang Dental Manufacturing Co., Wheeling, IL). A stainless 
steel stylet with a threaded plastic connector (Plastics One) was inserted into each cannula. 
Rats recovered for 5–7 days before behavioral testing.
Self-administration
Intravenous self-administration sessions were conducted in standard operant conditioning 
chambers (Med Associates, St. Albans, VT) as previously described (28; 29). After the 
acquisition of cocaine self-administration, rats were given either 1 h (short access; ShA) or 6 
h (long access; LgA) of daily access to FR1 cocaine self-administration for 14 escalation 
sessions (Figure S1). Following escalation, testing occurred under either FR1 or PR 
schedules of reinforcement (see supplemental Methods).
Electrophysiological Recordings
Coronal slices (300 μm) were prepared as previously described (30) in an ice-cold high-
sucrose solution using a vibrating microtome. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were 
made with a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), low-pass 
filtered at 2–5 kHz, digitized (Digidata 1440A; Molecular Devices), and stored using 
pClamp 10 software (Molecular Devices). The intracellular solution used for recordings was 
composed of (in mM): KCl 145; EGTA 5; MgCl2 5; HEPES 10; Na-ATP 2; Na-GTP 0.2. 
Recordings (Vhold= −60mV) were performed in the presence of 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-
dione (DNQX, 20 μM), DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (AP-5, 30 μM) and CGP55845A 
(1 μM).
Pharmacological Testing
SB-334867, a selective non-peptide HCRT-R1 antagonist (Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK), 
was dissolved in 5% Emulphor/5% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and diluted with saline 
(systemic behavioral studies) or 100% DMSO (intra-CeA behavioral studies). SB-334867 
was administered either intraperitoneally (0, 7.5, 15 and 30 mg/kg; 2 ml/kg) 30 min prior to 
behavioral testing, or intracranially (0, 10, 20 nmol; 250 nl) 15 min prior to testing. For 
cocaine self-administration testing, animals received all doses in a within-subject Latin-
Square design. A cocaine self-administration session without SB-334867 treatment was 
performed between testing days. For electrophysiological studies, HCRT-1 was dissolved in 
aCSF (1 μM) and SB-334867 was first dissolved into a 50 mM stock in 100% DMSO and 
subsequently diluted to experimental concentrations (10 μM) in aCSF for a final 
concentration of <0.1% DMSO. Drug effects were compared to control baseline levels prior 
to drug application.

 Doses for SB-334867 and the HCRT-1 peptide were based on a limited number of pilot 
studies and previously published data (17; 18; 20; 31–33) and had no discernible behavioral 
side effects. DMSO vehicle is shown to be acceptable for intra-cerebral injections and does 
not appear to result in neural tissue damage (34). We saw no aberrant tissue effects or 
significant change in behavior following intra-CeA administration of DMSO.
Reinstatement Testing
Following escalation, intra-CeA cannulated LgA rats underwent extinction training during 
which rats received intravenous saline substitution for cocaine until self-administration was 
reduced to ≤ 20% of their escalated baseline values for the total 6 h session (average 8 LgA 
sessions). Following extinction training, rats were acclimated to vehicle injections prior to 
testing and allowed a regular FR1 extinction session. On the day of testing, animals received 
yohimbine (2 mg/kg) 15 min following the intra-CeA infusion of either drug or vehicle and 
were tested for reinstatement of cocaine-seeking 10 min later (6 h session). The order of 
intra-CeA treatments (SB-334867 10 nmol or vehicle) was counterbalanced across animals, 
with extinction training and ≤ 20% baseline occurring prior to each treatment.
Histology and Data Selection
Following experimentation, cannulated animals were anesthetized and perfused 
transcardially with 4% formaldehyde. The brain was removed, placed in fixative, and 
subsequently frozen and sectioned (40 μm) through the rostral-caudal extent of the CeA. The 
ventral-most extent of the needle track was identified with Neutral Red stain. Data were 
included in the analyses only if the histology verified accurate placements of infusion 
needles (Figure S2).
Statistical Analysis
All data are expressed as means and standard errors of the mean (SEM). For behavioral 
studies, data were analyzed using either a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with 
group (ShA and LgA) as the between-subjects factor and treatment (0, 7.5, 15, and 30 
mg/kg) as the within-subjects factor, or a repeated-measure, one-way ANOVA 
(reinstatement testing only). When appropriate, post hoc comparisons were performed using 
Bonferroni’s multiple-comparison test, except when treatments were compared to a single 
control treatment (0 mg/kg) using Dunnett’s multiple-comparison test. Electrophysiological 
data were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA with post hoc analyses using Bonferroni’s 
multiple-comparison test or independent sample, two-tailed t-test. P values <0.05 were 
considered statistically significant for all tests.
Results
Systemic HCRT-R1 antagonist dose-dependently reduces FR1 cocaine self-administration 
in LgA rats
Rats were allowed ShA (1 h; n = 10) or LgA (6 h; n = 9; one rat was excluded due to loss of 
catheter patency) to cocaine self-administration on an FR1 schedule of reinforcement 
(Figure S1). Systemic HCRT-R1 antagonist (SB-334867) significantly reduced FR1 cocaine 
self-administration in the first hour in LgA rats at the doses of 15 and 30 mg/kg (Figure 1A;

 Group: F(1,17)= 6.79, p< 0.05; Treatment: F(3,51)= 9.86, p< 0.001; Group x treatment: 
F(3,51)= 3.07, p< 0.05). The SB-334867 treatment did not alter cocaine self-administration in 
ShA rats, as observed in previous studies. Further analysis of the LgA group showed the 
significant decrease in cocaine self-administration persisted for the entire 6 h session at the 
30 mg/kg dose only (Figure 1B; Treatment: F(3,24)= 3.45, p< 0.05).
Systemic HCRT-R1 antagonist reduces PR cocaine self-administration in ShA and LgA rats
Following FR1 self-administration testing, the same rats allowed ShA (n = 7; 3 rats were 
excluded due to loss of catheter patency) or LgA (n = 9) were tested on a PR schedule of 
reinforcement. Both ShA and LgA rats showed a significant reduction in PR responding 
following a systemic injection of SB-334867 at the highest dose tested under FR1 (30 
mg/kg) compared to vehicle-treated animals (Figure 2; Group: F(1,14)= 4.31, p= 0.06; 
Treatment: F(1,14)= 26.06, p< 0.001; Group x treatment: F(1,14)= 2.24, n.s.). These results are 
similar to previous reports that HCRT modulates effortful responding for cocaine self-
administration in ShA animals (18; 25), but also extend previous findings to conditions of 
LgA to cocaine self-administration.
Intra-CeA HCRT-R1 antagonist reduces cocaine self-administration in LgA rats
Based on the present results demonstrating systemic SB-334867 injection reduces cocaine 
self-administration (FR1) in LgA animals, we tested intra-CeA SB-334867 administration in 
LgA rats. A separate group of rats (n = 9; one rat was excluded due to misplaced cannulae) 
escalated their cocaine intake over 14 daily sessions and then received bilateral CeA 
cannulations. These LgA rats were tested under an FR1 schedule following bilateral intra-
CeA infusions of SB-334867 (10 and 20 nmol) and vehicle in a Latin-square design. Intra-
CeA SB-334867 reduced FR1 cocaine self-administration at the highest dose tested (20 
nmol; Figure 3; F(2,16)= 4.07, p< 0.05). This drug effect did not appear to persist for the 
entire 6 h session (data not shown, F(2,16)= 0.34, n.s.). These results indicate a role for 
HCRT within the CeA in compulsive-like cocaine-taking associated with extended access to 
drug self-administration.
Intra-CeA HCRT-R1 antagonist attenuates stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine self-
administration in LgA rats
Another separate group of rats (n = 9; one rat was excluded due to misplaced cannula) 
escalated their cocaine intake over 14 daily sessions (6 h) and then received bilateral CeA 
cannulations. These LgA animals underwent extinction training until FR1 responding was 
reduced to ≤20% of their escalated 6 h baseline values. Rats were tested for reinstatement of 
cocaine-seeking following bilateral intra-CeA infusion of SB-334867 (10 nmol) or vehicle 
in a counter-balanced order, with extinction sessions occurring between testing days. Intra-
CeA drug/vehicle infusions were followed by administration of a pharmacological stressor 
(yohimbine; 2 mg/kg) that, when administered alone, reinstates cocaine-seeking (19; 35). 
Intra-CeA SB-334867 pretreatment attenuated stress-induced reinstatement effects of 
yohimbine on cocaine-seeking compared with vehicle pretreatment in LgA rats (Figure 4; 
F(3,35)= 23.40, p< 0.001). These results suggest that the HCRT system within the CeA plays 
a role in stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine-seeking in LgA rats.

 Baseline GABAergic neurotransmission in the CeA is elevated in LgA rats
Inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) were recorded in medial CeA neurons from naïve, 
ShA and LgA rats (n = 6, 5, and 5 rats, respectively). CeA neurons from LgA (n = 30) rats 
had a significantly higher spontaneous IPSC (sIPSC) frequency compared to neurons from 
naïve or ShA rats (n = 27 each; Figure 5B, upper panel; F(2,81)= 4.41, p< 0.05) with no 
difference in sIPSC amplitude (Figure 5B, lower panel; F(2,81)= 1.15, n.s.) or rise or decay 
time (Figure S3A). Miniature IPSCs (mIPSCS) were assessed in the presence of tetrodotoxin 
(1 μM). Although there was a trend for increased mIPSC frequency in CeA neurons from 
LgA rats (n = 13) compared to neurons from naïve (n = 15) or ShA rats (n = 13; Figure 5C, 
left panel; F(2,38)= 1.61, n.s.), the difference was not significant. There was no difference in 
mIPSC amplitude (Figure 5C, right panel; F(2,38)= 1.18, n.s.) or rise or decay time (Figure 
S3B). These results suggest that only LgA to cocaine results in elevated baseline 
GABAergic transmission in the CeA and that these alterations likely occur at the presynaptic 
and network level.
HCRT-1 enhances GABAergic neurotransmission in the CeA of naïve but not ShA or LgA 
rats
To determine if stimulating HCRT receptors modulates CeA-GABA transmission, we 
performed recordings in CeA neurons from naïve, ShA and LgA rats (n = 4–6, 3, and 3 rats, 
respectively) during application of the HCRT-1 peptide. HCRT-1 (1 μM) increased sIPSC 
frequency in CeA neurons from naïve rats (n = 6) but not from ShA or LgA rats (n = 6 each; 
Figure 6B, left panel; F(2,15)= 5.549, p<0.05), suggesting that HCRT-1 increases GABA 
release in the CeA of cocaine-naïve rats only. HCRT-1 produced no change in sIPSC 
amplitude (Figure 6B, right panel; F(2,15)= 0.39, n.s.) or rise or decay time (Figure S3C). We 
also performed mIPSC recordings in CeA neurons from naïve, ShA and LgA rats. HCRT-1 
produced a significant increase in mIPSC frequency in neurons from naïve rats (n = 8) and 
not in neurons from ShA or LgA rats (n = 6 each; Figure 6C, left panel; F(2,17)= 7.09, p< 
0.01), indicating that HCRT-1 enhances vesicular GABA release in the CeA of cocaine-
naïve but not ShA or LgA rats. No change in mIPSC amplitude was noted (Figure 6C, right 
panel; F(2,17)= 3.47, n.s.) or rise or decay time (Figure S3D). These data indicate that 
stimulation of HCRT-receptors within the CeA increases both action potential-dependent 
and spontaneous vesicular GABAergic neurotransmission via a presynaptic mechanism of 
action that impacts both basal and activity-dependent conditions.
HCRT-R1 antagonist blocks enhanced GABAergic neurotransmission in the CeA of LgA 
rats
To determine if blocking HCRT-R1 modulates CeA-GABA transmission and if this 
modulation is altered by cocaine exposure, we performed sIPSC recordings in CeA neurons 
from naïve, ShA and LgA rats (n = 4, 3, 3 rats, respectively) during SB-334867 application. 
SB-334867 (10 μM) did not alter sIPSC frequency in CeA neurons from naïve (n = 5) or 
ShA rats (n = 8) but significantly decreased sIPSC frequency in neurons from LgA rats (n = 
8; Figure 7B, left panel; F(2,18)= 6.88, p< 0.01), suggesting that HCRT-R1 regulates basal 
CeA GABA release in LgA rats. No change in sIPSC amplitude (Figure 7B, right panel; 
F(2,18)= 0.12, n.s.) or rise or decay time (Figure S3E) was observed in naïve, ShA, or LgA

 rats. The magnitude of the decrease in sIPSC frequency with HCRT-R1 antagonism was 
positively correlated with the basal sIPSC frequency (Figure 7C; slope= 0.38 ± 0.1, R2= 
0.76, p< 0.01). We also performed mIPSC recordings in CeA neurons from naïve, ShA and 
LgA rats. SB-334867 produced a significant decrease in mIPSC frequency in CeA neurons 
from LgA rats (n = 6), a non-significant decrease in mIPSC frequency in neurons from ShA 
rats (n = 6) and no change in mIPSC frequency in neurons from naïve rats (n = 6; Figure 7D, 
left panel; F(2,15)= 7.79, p< 0.01). No change in mIPSC amplitude (Figure 7D, right panel; 
F(2,15)= 0.12, n.s.) or rise or decay time (Figure S3F) was observed in naïve, ShA, or LgA 
rat neurons. The magnitude of the decrease in mIPSC frequency with HCRT-R1 antagonism 
was also positively correlated with the basal mIPSC frequency (Figure 7E; slope= 0.50 
± 0.1, R2= 0.94, p< 0.05). These results suggest that the increased GABAergic 
neurotransmission in LgA rats is partially due to HCRT-R1 and that this increased signaling 
can be reversed by HCRT-R1 blockade.
Discussion
Escalation of cocaine intake is thought to reflect an important aspect of the transition from 
initial controlled drug use to uncontrolled drug dependence, or addiction, and has been 
associated with dysfunction of brain reward and stress systems (36). The HCRT 
neuropeptide system has been associated with both stress and drug-seeking behaviors (for 
review, 11; 12). Our overall hypothesis is that compulsive-like cocaine-taking is driven, in 
part, by negative emotional states during withdrawal via upregulation of brain motivational 
and stress systems, including HCRT within the CeA.
A role for HCRT in an enhanced state of motivation
In the present study, we report that the HCRT-R1 antagonist SB-334867 decreased cocaine 
self-administration under an FR1 schedule of reinforcement in rats allowed LgA to cocaine, 
with no significant effect in rats given ShA to cocaine. When tested under a PR schedule, 
both ShA and LgA rats showed a reduction in responding for cocaine following SB-334867 
administration. For ShA animals, the attenuation of cocaine-taking following SB-334867 
treatment under PR, but not FR1, is consistent with what has been observed in previous 
studies (17; 18). These results suggest that in the case of cocaine self-administration, HCRT 
may modulate some aspect of drug-seeking/taking behavior other than the acute, positively-
reinforcing actions of cocaine. Consistent with this hypothesis, central HCRT-1 increases 
intracranial self-stimulation thresholds, suggesting a potential inhibitory action on reward 
systems, pointing to a mechanism other than an increase in positive affect sensitivity (20). 
We hypothesize that HCRT not only plays a role in maintaining an adequate state of arousal 
needed for cocaine-seeking, but HCRT is also recruited under conditions of compulsive-like 
cocaine-taking associated with extended drug access in which enhanced motivational states 
are required. Consistent with this hypothesis, we demonstrate a role for HCRT 
neurotransmission in rats allowed extended cocaine access in that HCRT-R1 antagonism 
attenuated self-administration under both FR1 and PR schedules in LgA rats. Other studies 
also show HCRT-R1 antagonism attenuates effortful, compulsive-like responding under 
higher FR schedules (e.g. FR5; 16) even in animals allowed only ShA to cocaine. In the case 
of ShA self-administration under higher FR schedules, animals are in a condition that

 requires greater effort and as a result are more sensitive to motivational challenges. Together, 
these observations suggest that HCRT modulates compulsive-like, motivation-enhanced 
behavior, and may be associated with the negative emotional state changes that contribute to 
excessive drug-taking.
HCRT neurotransmission in the CeA is associated with compulsive-like cocaine intake
It is hypothesized that the aversive emotional state comprising anxiety and dysphoric-like 
effects following repeated cocaine withdrawal and acute or protracted abstinence is 
associated with addiction (4; 37). Escalated, compulsive-like cocaine-taking associated with 
addiction is mediated, in part, by the upregulation of brain stress systems (e.g., dynorphin 
and corticotropin releasing factor), particularly within subregions of the extended amygdala 
including the CeA. Given the substantial HCRT projections into the CeA and the established 
role for HCRT in stress (12; 14–16), we hypothesized that HCRT is an additional brain 
arousal/stress system recruited during compulsive-like drug-taking and that the CeA is a 
potential site of action for HCRT-mediated neuroplasticity. Our results show that intra-CeA 
HCRT neurotransmission plays an important role in compulsive-like cocaine self-
administration in LgA rats in that when administered directly into the CeA, SB-334867 
reduced cocaine-taking in LgA rats. Furthermore, intra-CeA SB-334867 blocked stress-
induced reinstatement of cocaine-seeking in LgA rats. These observations suggest that 
HCRT dysregulation may promote neuroadapations within the CeA of animals allowed 
escalated cocaine intake. However, it remains to be determined whether HCRT 
neurotransmission within the CeA also modulates cocaine-seeking in rats allowed ShA to 
cocaine, particularly under conditions that require increased effort.
Enhanced HCRT modulation of GABAergic signaling in the CeA is associated with 
extended access to cocaine and can be reversed by an HCRT-R1 antagonist
Electrophysiological studies support our behavioral findings in that HCRT in the CeA acts, 
in part, by modulating GABAergic neurotransmission and this modulation is selectively 
altered in rats with a history of cocaine exposure. Notably, LgA rats displayed increased 
GABA release in the CeA that was not observed in naïve or ShA rats. The significant 
increase in action potential-dependent GABA release, as well as the trend for increased 
action potential-independent vesicular GABA release, suggest that LgA to cocaine engages 
the HCRT system to upregulate both stimulated and spontaneous GABA, with potentially 
distinct mechanisms of release (38). These findings corroborate previous work reporting 
increased evoked GABA release in the CeA following cocaine self-administration (27). The 
previous study found increased evoked GABA release in both ShA and LgA rats, a 
discrepancy that may be due to the stimulation paradigm (27) as opposed to the spontaneous 
neurotransmission examined in this study. We also found that the HCRT system can directly 
modulate GABA signaling in the CeA and that this modulation is altered by exposure to 
cocaine. Stimulation of HCRT-R1 increases GABA release in the CeA of naïve rats, but this 
increase is absent in both ShA and LgA rats, suggesting that the HCRT system is recruited 
early in cocaine exposure, but does not impact GABA signaling until after more prolonged 
exposure. Consistent with this interpretation, antagonism of HCRT-R1 significantly reduced 
GABA release in CeA neurons from LgA (versus ShA or naïve) rats. Collectively, these 
results suggest that the CeA GABA system is a critical site for neuroadaptations following

 prolonged cocaine-taking and demonstrate that elevations in GABA signaling following 
extended cocaine access are due, in part, to recruitment of HCRT.
In summary, we showed that HCRT-R1 blockade reduced cocaine self-administration and 
stress-induced reinstatement in LgA rats, suggesting a role for HCRT modulation of 
compulsive-like intake associated with dependence. Furthermore, these behavioral data are 
supported by electrophysiological studies demonstrating enhanced GABAergic transmission 
in the CeA of LgA rats that is reduced with HCRT-R1 antagonism. However, the present 
results do not preclude additional functional mediation of escalated cocaine-taking by 
HCRT-R2 in the CeA and/or other stress-related brain regions (e.g., BNST, NAc). HCRT-R2 
or dual receptor antagonists should be considered for future experiments. Nonetheless, the 
current findings clearly suggest HCRT-R1 neurotransmission contributes to the etiology of 
compulsive-like cocaine intake.
