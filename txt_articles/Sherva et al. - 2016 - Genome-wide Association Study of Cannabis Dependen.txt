IMPORTANCE Cannabis dependence (CAD) is a serious problem worldwide and is of growing
importance in the United States because cannabis is increasingly available legally. Although
genetic factors contribute substantially to CAD risk, at present no well-established specific
genetic risk factors for CAD have been elucidated.
OBJECTIVE To report findings for DSM-IV CAD criteria from association analyses performed in
large cohorts of African American and European American participants from 3 studies of
substance use disorder genetics.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This genome-wide association study for DSM-IV CAD
criterion count was performed in 3 independent substance dependence cohorts (the
Yale-Penn Study, Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment [SAGE], and International
Consortium on the Genetics of Heroin Dependence [ICGHD]). A referral sample and
volunteers recruited in the community and from substance abuse treatment centers included
6000 African American and 8754 European American participants, including some from
small families. Participants from the Yale-Penn Study were recruited from 2000 to 2013. Data
were collected for the SAGE trial from 1990 to 2007 and for the ICGHD from 2004 to 2009.
Data were analyzed from January 2, 2013, to November 9, 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Criterion count for DSM-IV CAD.
RESULTS Among the 14 754 participants, 7879 were male, 6875 were female, and the mean
(SD) age was 39.2 (10.2) years. Three independent regions with genome-wide significant
single-nucleotide polymorphism associations were identified, considering the largest possible
sample. These included rs143244591 (β = 0.54, P = 4.32 × 10−10 for the meta-analysis) in
novel antisense transcript RP11-206M11.7; rs146091982 (β = 0.54, P = 1.33 × 10−9 for the
meta-analysis) in the solute carrier family 35 member G1 gene (SLC35G1); and rs77378271
(β = 0.29, P = 2.13 × 10−8 for the meta-analysis) in the CUB and Sushi multiple domains 1 gene
(CSMD1). Also noted was evidence of genome-level pleiotropy between CAD and major
depressive disorder and for an association with single-nucleotide polymorphisms in genes
associated with schizophrenia risk. Several of the genes identified have functions related to
neuronal calcium homeostasis or central nervous system development.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These results are the first, to our knowledge, to identify
specific CAD risk alleles and potential genetic factors contributing to the comorbidity of CAD
with major depression and schizophrenia.

A
fter nicotine, cannabis is the most widely abused drug
worldwide.1 In the United States, the accelerated de-
criminalization of cannabis is based on the erroneous
perception that it is relatively harmless.2 In fact, cannabis use
produces craving,3 dependence,4 and drug-seeking behavior,5
as with the use of other substances. Despite these risks, the
prevalenceofcannabisuseandcannabisusedisordershasdra-
matically increased since 2001,6 and the political momen-
tumtoincreaseavailabilityhascontinued.Useofcannabisearly
in life is associated with an increased risk for schizophrenia
(SCZ),7 and sets of SCZ-associated risk alleles predict canna-
bis use.8 Cannabis use is also a risk factor for depressive
symptoms,9 and a twin study showed cannabis dependence
(CAD) to be associated with an elevated risk for major depres-
sive disorder (MDD).10 Substance use and other psychiatric ill-
nesses may share common genetic risk factors; or reverse cau-
sation, self-medication, or confounding by other factors may
explain their co-occurrence.
Despite knowledge of the neurobiology of the endocan-
nabinoid system and its response to tetrahydrocannabinol,
little is known about specific genetic factors influencing sus-
ceptibility to CAD or cannabis abuse. A twin study showed that
severalaspectsofcannabisuseareheritable,includinganearly
opportunity to use (h2 = 72%), early onset of use (h2 = 80%),
lifetime use of cannabis 11 or more times (h2 = 76%), and can-
nabis abuse or dependence (h2 = 21%-72%), where h2 is
hertiability.11-13 Possible evidence of linkage of CAD on chro-
mosome 1614 and linkage and association encompassing the
neuregulin 1 gene (NRG1 [OMIM 142445]; known as a pos-
sible SCZ risk gene15) on chromosome 816 have been found. De-
spite several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on can-
nabis-related traits, no genome-wide significant (GWS)
associations were observed for initiation of use17 or for CAD.18
Herein we report on findings for DSM-IV CAD criteria from as-
sociationanalysesperformedinlargecohortsofAfricanAmeri-
canandEuropeanAmericanparticipantsfrom3studiesofsub-
stance use disorder genetics who underwent genotyping with
genome-wide microarrays. The primary cohort has been used
in previous studies to identify genes associated with opioid
(OD),19 cocaine (CD),20 alcohol (AD),21 and nicotine (ND)
dependence22 and posttraumatic stress disorder.23
Methods
Participants and Diagnostic Procedures
The samples included 6000 African American and 8754 Euro-
pean American participants (race was assigned based on
genetic data; eMethods in the Supplement) from the follow-
ing 3 studies: (1) the Yale-Penn Study cohort of small nuclear
families and unrelated individuals (2020 individuals in 850
families and 6951 unrelated individuals), collected to study
the genetics of substance dependence19-21; (2) the GWAS data
set from the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment
(SAGE),24-27 collected to study the genetics of AD, ND, and CD
(183 individuals in 89 families and 3707 unrelated individu-
als); and (3) the GWAS International Consortium on the
Genetics of Heroin Dependence (ICGHD),28,29 a collaboration
formed to identify genes associated with heroin dependence
risk (66 individuals in 33 families and 1827 unrelated indi-
viduals). The SAGE and ICGHD data sets are publicly avail-
able via application. The present study received institutional
review board approval from all participating institutions,
and written informed consent was obtained from all study
participants.
Participants from the Yale-Penn Study were recruited
from 2000 to 2013. These participants were administered the
Semi-Structured Assessment for Drug Dependence and
Alcoholism30 to derive DSM-IV diagnoses of lifetime CAD and
other major psychiatric traits. Data were collected for the
SAGE trial from 1990 to 2007, and participants underwent
phenotyping with the Semi-Structured Assessment for the
Genetics of Alcoholism.31 Data were collected for the ICGHD
from 2004 to 2009, and participants completed a compre-
hensive psychiatric diagnostic interview based on the Semi-
Structured Assessment of the Genetics of Alcoholism–
Australia.31 The method of phenotyping was similar across the
3 samples. Additional information about recruitment, geno-
typing, imputation, and quality control for the study cohorts
is provided in eMethods in the Supplement.
Statistical Analysis
DatawereanalyzedfromJanuary2,2013,toNovember9,2015.
Association analyses were performed using a count of DSM-IV
CAD criteria (0-7) as the outcome variable and the imputed mi-
nor allele dosage (adjusted for sex, age, and the first 3 ances-
try principal components) as a predictor variable. This ordi-
nal trait model has greater power to detect genetic associations
than a univariate model based on disease status because of
greater information content and improved specificity of the
dependence measure. Association tests were performed using
linear association models embedded in generalized estimat-
ing equations to correct for correlations among related
individuals.32Analyseswereperformedseparatelywithineach
data set and population group, and the results were com-
bined by meta-analysis using the inverse variance method
implemented in the program METAL.33 Genomic inflation fac-
tors (λ) were calculated within each subpopulation, and P val-
ues were corrected accordingly. We performed a second cor-
rection for the λ factor calculated after the meta-analysis.
For the primary analysis, individuals were included re-
gardless of cannabis exposure. As secondary analyses, indi-
viduals who reported never having used cannabis were ex-
cluded, and the primary model was repeated adjusting for the
Key Points
Question What specific genetic variants contribute to cannabis
dependence risk?
Findings Three regions had genome-wide significant evidence of
association with cannabis dependence and evidence of genetic
overlap between cannabis dependence and schizophrenia and
major depressive disorder.
Meaning Cannabis dependence has a genetic risk component
that may overlap with other psychiatric disorders.

criterion counts for AD, CD, and OD. Participants from 2 geno-
typing batches in the Yale-Penn cohort (Yale-Penn 1 and Yale-
Penn 2) were combined with the SAGE sample to form a dis-
covery data set. A sample consisting of the ICGHD data and
additional samples from the Yale-Penn cohort who did not un-
dergo genotyping at the time of the discovery analyses (Yale-
Penn 3) were used to replicate the top associations.
Cross-Disorder Analysis
We attempted to uncover shared genetic variation between
CAD and 5 psychiatric disorders, including SCZ, MDD, bipolar
affectivedisorder,attention-deficit/hyperactivitydisorder,and
autism spectrum disorder using the GWAS analysis reported
herein and publicly available GWAS results from the Psychi-
atricGenomicsConsortium(http://www.med.unc.edu/pgc/).34
To explore cross-disorder genetic relationships, we used
stratified quintile-quintile (QQ) plots to evaluate the relative
enrichment of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
associated with both disorders. The QQ plots, which contrast
the observed distribution of P values with the expected
distributionunderthenullhypothesis(uniforminGWAS),were
used to assess P value inflation in the GWAS results. Grouping
associatedSNPsforonedisorderandcomparing(acrossgroups)
the QQ plots of another disorder, however, could also reveal
the enrichment of GWAS signals between disorders, which
made them suitable for cross-disorder enrichment screening.
We also applied a statistical framework for pleiotropy
analysis, Genetic Analysis Incorporating Pleiotropy and An-
notation (GPA).35 The GPA was built as a mixture model with
parameters estimated using an efficient expectation-
maximization algorithm, where associated SNPs were mod-
eled with a β [α, 1] distribution and unassociated SNPs with a
uniform [0, 1] distribution. A likelihood ratio test assessed the
significance of pleiotropy between disorders. The GPA also de-
tected the SNPs that were pleiotropic by calculating the pos-
terior probability of association with both disorders.
Results
Participantdemographiccharacteristicsandthecorrelationbe-
tween the criterion counts for CAD and other substance use
disorder traits are shown in Table 1. The DSM-IV CAD crite-
rion counts were significantly (P < .05) correlated with the cri-
teria counts for AD, CD, OD, and ND. The correlations varied
by sample and population and ranged from r2 = 0.15 for OD to
r2 = 0.61 for CD criteria. The CAD criterion counts were sig-
nificantlyheritableinEuropeanAmerican(19%-25%;P = .006)
butnotAfricanAmerican(10%-11%;P = .08)participants.eFig-
ure 1 in the Supplement shows a histogram of the CAD crite-
rion count in African American and European American par-
ticipants in each cohort; 3 or more criteria indicate a diagnosis
of CAD. The criterion count distribution is very similar in Afri-
canAmericanandEuropeanAmericanparticipants.IntheYale-
Penn sample, where comorbid psychiatric diagnoses were
available, CAD was significantly associated with MDD in Afri-
can American participants (odds ratio, 1.07; P = .006) but not
SCZ, bipolar affective disorder, attention-deficit/hyperac-
tivity disorder, or autism spectrum disorder. Cannabis depen-
dence was not associated with any of these disorders in Eu-
ropean American participants.
GWAS Results
Manhattan and QQ plots for the meta-analysis discovery GWAS
results for African American and European American Yale-
Penn 1 and 2 and SAGE cohorts are displayed in eFigures 2 and
3 in the Supplement. We found little evidence of P value infla-
tion. Table 2 shows associations in the discovery sample with
P < 1.0 × 10−5 in African American or European American par-
ticipants or the combined meta-analysis, trimmed for linkage
disequilibrium. eTable 1 in the Supplement shows the same re-
sults, together with additional information about each SNP, in-
cluding the results within each discovery sample subgroup, af-
ter excluding individuals with no cannabis exposure, and after
adjusting for comorbid substance use disorders. We identified
GWS associations with reliably imputed SNPs in 3 distinct re-
gions (Table 2), 2 specific to African American participants and
1 in the combined sample. First, rs186825689 (P = 1.86 × 10−8
for the African American meta-analysis) is located 12.4 kb up-
stream from the gene encoding S100 calcium binding protein
(S100B) with contributions from both informative African

withconsistenteffectdirectionineveryEuropeanAmericanand
African American population tested (minimum P = 1.74 × 10−7
for the meta-analysis). This signal was GWS when individuals
without cannabis exposure were excluded (minimum
P = 2.98 × 10−8 for the meta-analysis).
Replication Results
The SNPs in Table 2 were tested for CAD association in the 2
replication samples (ICGHD and Yale-Penn 3). Table 3 shows
the replication cohort-specific results for these SNPs, with the
meta-analysis results from the discovery phase and the dis-
covery + replication phase. The smallest P value in the ICGHD
cohort among the 13 SNPs that could be reliably imputed and
analyzed (this cohort was European Australian) was at
rs74823926 (P = .064) in an intergenic region on chromo-
some 1. Several associations, however, were replicated in the
Yale-Penn 3 sample (Table 3). The P values for 2 of the 3 GWS
SNPs improved after meta-analysis with the replication co-
horts (rs143244591 in RP11-206M11.7, from 1.38 × 10−8 to
4.32 × 10−10; rs77378271 in CSMD1, from 2.84 × 10−8 to
2.13 × 10−8), as did the P value for another SNP, rs146091982
in the solute carrier family 35 member G1 (SLC35G1 [Ensembl
ENSG00000176273]) (from 1.31 × 10−7 to 1.33 × 10−9). The sig-
nal in PI4K2B also improved (P = 5.57 × 10−8 for the full meta-
analysis). However, rs186825689 near S100B was no longer
GWS (P = 8.27 × 10−8) in the full meta-analysis. The Figure
shows Manhattan plots for the regions encompassing RP11-
206M11.7 (Figure, A), SLC35G1 (Figure, B), CSMD1 (Figure, C),
and PI4K2B (Figure, D) in the discovery sample and after meta-
analysis with the replication samples.

fied based on our CAD GWAS results at significance levels of
P < .05, P < .01, P < 1 × 10−3, and P < 1 × 10−4. We observed en-
richment of the MDD GWAS signal in the CAD GWAS (eFigure
4 in the Supplement) in European American participants, but
no clear enrichment for the other 4 psychiatric disorders in
either population group (eFigure 5 in the Supplement).
We used GPA to test the significance of pleiotropy between
CAD and the same 5 psychiatric disorders (eMethods in the
Supplement). For each disease pair, we estimated the percent-
age of SNPs shared by 2 diseases and tested the significance of
pleiotropy (eTable 2 in the Supplement). The European Ameri-
can population yielded significant evidence of CAD-MDD plei-
otropy(P = 2.39 × 10−5);genomewide,1.7%ofallimputedSNPs
were estimated to be associated with both CAD and MDD. Of

Discussion
We report herein the first GWS results for CAD to our knowl-
edge. The sample includes a large proportion (18%-36%, de-
pending on race and cohort) of individuals with CAD from 2
ancestral populations in 3 independent cohorts. We identified
3 regions with GWS SNPs imputed to the 1000 Genomes

A, The 148.8- to 149.2-MB region encompassing RP11-206M11.7 on chromosome 3
in the Yale-Penn and Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment (SAGE) African
American participants. B, The 95.3- to 96-MB region encompassing SLC35G1 on
chromosome 10 in the Yale-Penn and SAGE African American participants. C, The
2.8- to 4.8-MB region on chromosome 8 encompassing CSMD1 in the Yale-Penn,

and ICGHD African American and European American participants. In A and B, the
SNPs are color coded according to the correlation coefficient (r2) in the 1000
Genomes African samples with the most significant SNP. In C and D, results from
the African American and European American participants were combined, and no
linkage disequilibrium information was displayed. The light purple circle represents
the −log10 P value for the most significant regional SNP in the meta-analysis of the
discovery samples; the purple diamond, the result for that SNP after meta-analysis

gene to be implicated in both disorders (after NRG116) and may
explain at least part of their shared genetic susceptibility.
Two other established SCZ risk genes, RIMS1 (OMIM
606629) (minimum SNP, P = 1.59 × 10−5) and MEF2C (mini-
mumSNP,P = 5.22 × 10−5),showedsuggestiveassociationwith
CAD. MEF2C is highly expressed in developing mammalian
neurons and is thought to mediate calcium-dependent sur-
vival of neurons that have made the appropriate synaptic
connections.43 From a biological perspective, RIMS1 is imme-
diately relevant; RIMS1 acts as a scaffold protein that regu-
lates synaptic vesicle exocytosis, affecting cannabinoid recep-
tor 1 (CR1)–mediated long-term suppression of γ-aminobutyric
acid release, ultimately mediating presynaptic forms of long-
term plasticity.44 Minor alleles at rs142305709 in RIMS1 were
associated with fewer CAD criteria in African American par-
ticipants. We observed at least a nominally significant signal
inbothYale-PennAfricanAmericananalysissubsetsandanon-
significant trend in SAGE African American participants.
Limitations of the GWAS findings should be noted. One of
the significant SNPs identified (rs143244591 on chromosome
3)haslittlesupportiveevidenceforassociationfromotherSNPs
in the region, possibly owing to low linkage disequilibrium.
However, despite stringent imputation quality thresholds for
including SNPs in the analysis (r2≥0.8) and evidence of an as-
sociation in the replication sample, this signal may represent
animputationartifact.Second,althoughnoneoftheGWSSNPs
identified in the full GWAS analysis are rare, they could be de-
scribed as infrequent, with minor allele frequencies in a range
sometimesassociatedwithfalse-positiveresults(4%-6%).Also,
of the GWS regions, only CSMD1 showed evidence of associa-
tions in European American and African American partici-
pants. The region containing PI4K2B, which became GWS af-
ter excluding unexposed individuals (see below), was also at
least nominally associated with CAD in both populations. The
2 African American–specific SNPs were rare or monomorphic
in European American participants. The lack of association in
European American participants could be owing to different
linkage disequilibrium patterns or the absence of causal vari-
ants.TheYale-Pennsampleswhounderwentgenotypingonthe
HumanOmni1-Quad and Human Core Exome chips showed
more consistent results than the corresponding SAGE popula-
tion, which is not surprising insofar as SAGE participants were
recruited from different areas and ascertained using different
criteria (AD, CD, and OD in Yale-Penn and primarily AD and ND
in SAGE). The difference in ascertainment criteria (use of licit
vs illicit drugs) across studies likely explains the fact that the
proportion of cannabis-exposed individuals varied signifi-
cantly across cohorts (2293 in SAGE population [76.9%] and
7626 in the Yale-Penn population [85.0%]). The limitations of
phenotypic distribution and population differences are more
relevant to the Australian ICGHD replication cohort and may
explain the lack of replication in this cohort. Despite this, we
obtained statistically significant evidence for formal replica-
tion for the SNP in SLC35G1 and stronger evidence for associa-
tion at many of the top SNPs after including the replication
samples. Finally, these cohorts have higher rates of polysub-
stance dependence than the general population and may not
be generalizable to individuals who only use cannabis.
Effect of Exposure Status and Comorbidity
Because the inclusion of genetically at-risk individuals who
never initiated cannabis use might have influenced our re-
sults, we repeated the primary analyses in the discovery co-
hort after removing unexposed individuals. Two of the 3 re-
gions identified remained GWS (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
ThePvalueforrs143244591onchromosome3improvedslightly
(P = 1.13 × 10−8, meta-analysis exposed) and was associated at
P ≤ .02 in each of the African American subgroups. The signal
at rs77378271 in CSMD1 was almost identical (P = 2.95 × 10−8,
meta-analysis exposed) and showed association at
P < 5.07 × 10−3 in 2 of the 3 European American subgroup and
at P = 4.46 × 10−4 in 1 of the African American subgroups. In
addition, the block of SNPs in and around PI4K2B became GWS
with a consistent effect direction (minor alleles being protec-
tive) in every European American and African American popu-
lationtestedandbecameGWS(minimumP = 2.98 × 10−8,meta-
analysis exposed, at rs147170184). The evidence for pleiotropy
between CAD and MDD was attenuated substantially (P = .60)
afterexcludingunexposedparticipants.Thattheremovalofun-
exposed individuals from the analysis had a relatively minor
effect on the primary findings and actually improved the
strength of some suggests that any loss in power owing to the
smaller sample was offset by an increase in phenotypic preci-
sion. In the pleiotropy analysis, which relies on genome-level
association results and is not limited to the most significantly
associated SNPs, the power loss apparently outweighed any in-
creaseinprecision.ThesignificanceofeachofthetopSNPswas
modestly attenuated after adjusting for the DSM-IV criterion
counts for AD, CD, and OD (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Ion Homeostasis and Addiction
The previously published GWAS of OD19 and CD20 in a subset
of this sample each identified risk genes and pathways in-
volved in the regulation of neuronal calcium and potassium,
andthepathwayinvolvingsynapticlong-termpotentiationwas
also identified for OD. Also, a cross-disorder analysis identi-

play a role in CAD risk.
Shared Risk for CAD and Other Psychiatric Disorders
Many previous studies7,8,45,46 have focused on the relation-
ship between CAD and SCZ, whereas the correlation between
CAD and MDD has received much less attention. Although de-
pressive disorders are highly comorbid with CAD in clinical
settings,47 to our knowledge no previous genomics study has
explored CAD-MDD pleiotropy. We found some evidence for
genetic correlation between the risks for CAD and MDD. The
existence of shared genetic factors for CAD-MDD is supported
by the overlap in SNPs nominally associated with both traits,
although we found no significant evidence of pleiotropy at any
singleSNP.Wealsofoundlimitedsupportforthepossibilitythat
such a relationship exists for CAD and SCZ based on relatively
strong signals for both traits with variants in CSMD1 (although
not the same variants). Nongenetic explanations such as

Environment and Health Initiative, and by contract
HHSN268200782096C (High Throughput
Genotyping for Studying the Genetic Contributions
to Human Disease) from the National Institute on
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, the National
Institute on Drug Abuse, NIH. Support for collection
of datasets and samples was provided by grant U10
AA008401 (Collaborative Study on the Genetics of
Alcoholism), grant P01 CA089392 (Collaborative
Genetic Study of Nicotine Dependence), and grant
R01 DA013423 (Family Study of Cocaine
Dependence) from the NIH. The International
Consortium on the Genetics of Heroin Dependence
(principal investigator, Elliot Nelson, MD) was
funded by HHSN268200782096C (NIH contract:
High Throughput Genotyping for Studying the
Genetic Contributions to Human Disease) and
HHSN268201100011I (NIH contract: High
Throughput Genotyping for Studying the Genetic
Contributions to Human Disease).
Role of the Funder/Sponsor: The funding sources
had no role in the design and conduct of the study;
collection, management, analysis, and
interpretation of the data; preparation, review, or
approval of the manuscript; and decision to submit
the manuscript for publication.
Additional Information: The publicly available
datasets used for analysis were obtained from
dbGaP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) through
accession numbers phs000092.v1.p and
phs000277.v1.p1.
Additional Contributions: Work in recruitment and
assessment was performed at Yale University
School of Medicine and the APT Foundation by
James Poling, PhD; at McLean Hospital by Roger
Weiss, MD; at the Medical University of South
Carolina by Kathleen Brady, MD, PhD, and Raymond
Anton, MD; and at the University of Pennsylvania
by David Oslin, MD. Genotyping services for a part
of our genome-wide association study were
provided by the Center for Inherited Disease
Research and Yale University (Center for Genome
Analysis), which is fully funded by Federal contract
N01-HG-65403 from the NIH to The Johns Hopkins
University. Ann Marie Lacobelle, BS, Catherine Aldi,
BS, and Christa Robinson, BS, provided technical
assistance. The Semi-structured Assessment for
Drug Dependence and Alcoholism interviewers, led
by Yari Nuñez and Michelle Slivinsky, devoted
substantial time and effort to phenotype the study
sample. John Farrell, PhD, Section of Biomedical
Genetics, Boston University School of Medicine,
provided database management assistance. None
of these individuals were compensated for this
contribution to this study. Assistance with
phenotype harmonization, genotype cleaning, and
general study coordination was provided by the
Gene Environment Association Studies
Coordinating Center (supported by grant U01
HG004446 from the NIH). Assistance with data
cleaning was provided by the National Center for
Biotechnology Information.
