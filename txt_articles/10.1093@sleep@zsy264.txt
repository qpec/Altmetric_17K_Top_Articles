ABSTRACT 
 
Background: The study objectives were to explore trends in prevalence of co-use of benzodiazepine 
receptor modulators and opioids, and non-selective and selective (i.e., Z-drugs) benzodiazepine receptor 
modulators, in the United States, as well as risk factors for these drug utilization patterns. 
Methods: This was a multi-year, cross-sectional, population-level study, using United States health 
survey data. Data from eight National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cycles were 
analyzed, from 1999-2000 until 2013-2014, with each survey cycle containing information on ~10,000 
individuals. The main measure was prevalent prescription drug use within 30 days preceding survey 
administration. Drug usage was objectively confirmed for a large majority of participants though direct 
inspection of prescription bottles. 
Results: The estimated prevalence of concurrent benzodiazepine receptor modulator and opioid use in 
the United States was 0.39% in 1999-2000 and 1.36% in 2013-2014, reflecting absolute and relative 
changes of +0.97% and +249%. The estimated prevalence of non-selective and selective benzodiazepine 
receptor modulator co-use steadily rose in the United States from 0.05% in 1999-2000 to 0.47% in 2013-
2014, reflecting absolute and relative increases of +0.42% and +840%. Independent risk factors for these 
two forms of psychoactive medication polypharmacy were identified. 
Conclusion: In this exploratory analysis, concurrent use of benzodiazepine receptor modulators and 
opioids, and non-selective and selective benzodiazepine receptor modulators, was found to have 
progressively risen in the United States. The progressive increases in these two forms of psychoactive 
medication polypharmacy is concerning, given that these drug use patterns are associated with 
increased risk for serious adverse outcomes.

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE 
 
This is the first study to estimate trends in prevalence of non-selective and selective benzodiazepine 
receptor modulator co-use in the United States and the first to explore risk factors for co-usage of non-
selective and selective benzodiazepine receptor modulators, and co-usage of benzodiazepine receptor 
modulators and opioids. Over a recent 16-year period, concurrent non-selective and selective 
benzodiazepine receptor modulator use, and benzodiazepine receptor modulator and opioid use, 
progressively rose in the United States. The increasing prevalences of these two forms of psychoactive 
medication polypharmacy is concerning, given that these drug use patterns are associated with greater 
risk of poor health outcomes. Further research is needed to understand the reasons behind the rising 
prevalences of these two patterns of drug use.

INTRODUCTION 
 
 
Inappropriate polypharmacy is a frequent problem, especially in the older adult population.1 
One of the consequences of polypharmacy is increased risk for adverse drug events, either because of 
drug-disease or drug-drug interactions.1 Psychoactive medications have been identified as a drug group 
commonly contributing to inappropriate polypharmacy.2-3 Two examples of potentially inappropriate 
psychoactive drug polypharmacy include co-usage of benzodiazepines receptor modulators and opioids, 
and the concurrent use of non-selective and selective benzodiazepine receptor modulators.  
In September 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a safety warning directed 
towards prescribers and patients regarding the concurrent use of benzodiazepine receptor modulators 
and opioids.4 The US FDA went to so far as to mandate that a ‘boxed warning’ label be applied to all 
opioid and benzodiazepine drug packaging regarding the concurrent use of these drugs and this 
measure reflects the “strongest form” of FDA warning.4 The increased morbidity and mortality 
associated with co-usage of benzodiazepine receptor modulators and opioids is well-established. Opioid 
users who concurrently take benzodiazepine drugs have been found to have a greater than two-fold risk 
of emergency room presentation or hospital admission for opioid-related adverse event.5 Mortality has 
been found to be multi-fold higher among opioid and benzodiazepine co-users versus users of opioids

alone,6-8 with one study reporting a ten-fold increased mortality risk among co-users.6 Despite the 
documented risks of benzodiazepine receptor modulator and opioid co-use, this dangerous form of 
psychoactive polypharmacy has been unfortunately rising in the US. One analysis of a prescription 
database (which covered an estimated 56% of all prescription dispensings in the US) showed a 41% 
relative increase over time in benzodiazepine receipt among opioid users between 2002-2014.9 Our 
understanding of the reasons and risk factors for this suboptimal prescribing pattern is incomplete.9-10 
A second form of inappropriate psychoactive polypharmacy is concurrent use of non-selective 
and selective benzodiazepine receptor modulator drugs. There are two broad categories of 
benzodiazepine receptor modulator drugs, non-selective and selective, with the 'selectivity' referring to 
the drug’s affinity for the alpha-1 subunit within the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor, 
to which benzodiazepine drugs bind.11 There is a diversity of GABA type A receptor subtypes, each with 
potentially differing function and benzodiazepine ligand affinity,11-12 and the various GABA type A 
receptor subtypes are found in different concentrations in different organs of the body.13 GABA type A 
receptors with the alpha-1 subunit are heavily concentrated in the thalamus, brainstem and cerebellum, 
and their activation is thought to be largely responsible for benzodiazepine drugs' sedative effects.11-12 
Non-selective benzodiazepine receptor modulator drugs (which often end with syllable –pam or –lam 
[see Table 1 for a listing]) bind to many GABA type A receptor subtypes. In contrast, selective 
benzodiazepine receptor modulator drugs (popularly called Z-drugs, because the letter 'z' appears at or 
near the start of their names [see Table 1 for a listing]) have high affinity for the GABA type A receptor 
with the alpha-1 subunit.11-12 Given their high affinity for GABA type A receptors with the alpha-1 subunit 
and this receptor’s ability to promote sedation, Z-drugs are marketed and prescribed specifically as 
sleep aids and not as anxiolytics.14 Because selective benzodiazepine receptor modulators do not end 
with the syllable –pam or –lam, like their non-selective counterparts do, and instead the letter 'z'

characteristically appears at or near the start of their names, this may mislead prescribers into thinking 
that these drugs belong to a separate, non-benzodiazepine drug class. Indeed, selective benzodiazepine 
receptor modulators or Z-drugs have been incorrectly labelled as "non-benzodiazepines" in many 
published reports.14-21 It is logical to assume that risks for benzodiazepine-related adverse effects may 
be increased by concomitant use of non-selective and selective benzodiazepine receptor modulators, 
but there is minimal data on this topic. One study involving individuals with COPD found that concurrent 
receipt of non-selective and selective benzodiazepine receptor modulators resulted in higher odds of 
respiratory failure compared to use of one these drug classes alone (with non-benzodiazepine users 
serving as the reference group).16 Little attention has been paid to quantifying and characterizing the 
concurrent use of non-selective and selective benzodiazepine receptor modulators in the general 
population.22  
The purpose of this study was to explore for possible trends in the prevalence of opioid and 
benzodiazepine receptor modulator co-usage, and the concurrent use of non-selective and selective 
benzodiazepine receptor modulators, in the general United States population, as well as to explore for 
potential risk factors for these patterns of suboptimal drug utilization. 
 
METHODS 
 
 
Study design. This was a cross-sectional study, using population-level data from the United 
States, spanning a 16-year period.

Data sources. This study used United States national health survey data from the National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). The NHANES is a cross-sectional survey 
undertaken in the United States by the Centers for Disease Control every two years and each survey 
sample represents the total non-institutionalized civilian United States population residing in the 50 
states and District of Columbia. Data from eight NHANES cycles were used (starting with the 1999-2000 
cycle and ending with the 2013-2014 cycle), representing a total of 16 years of data. Data from survey 
cycles beyond 2013-2014 could not be used, since information on prescription drug use was no longer 
collected. Trained professionals collected sociodemographic and health information from participants 
in-person. Participants were interviewed in their homes and physically examined in a mobile 
examination centers. Data on approximately 10,000 individuals was collected with each NHANES cycle. A 
detailed description of the NHANES design and methodology is available.23 
 
 
Prescription drug use. Each NHANES cycle collected from all participants (no age restrictions) 
information regarding prescription medication use within the preceding 30 days. NHANES specifically 
asked participants: "In the past 30 days, have you used or taken a medication for which a prescription is 
needed?". Among those who responded affirmatively, survey participants were then asked to show the 
interviewer the medication containers of all prescription drugs used in the past 30 days. Prescription 
medication information was objectively collected in this way for a large majority of participants (in as 
low as 73.0% of participants in 2009-2010 survey cycle to as high as 92.6% of participants in the 2013-
2014 survey cycle). For the minority of participants who could not produce their prescription bottles, 
specific prescription medication use was self-reported. Table 1 lists the non-selective and selective 
benzodiazepine receptor modulators, as well as opioids, which survey participants used. Individuals 
were classed as having used a non-selective benzodiazepine receptor modulator, a selective

benzodiazepine receptor modulator or an opioid if they were prescribed at least one drug from the 
respective types. Individuals were classified as having concurrently used a non-selective and a selective 
benzodiazepine receptor modulator drug if they were prescribed at least one drug from both 
benzodiazepine categories. Individuals were classified as having concurrently used a benzodiazepine 
receptor modulator and opioid if they were prescribed at least one benzodiazepine (either non-selective 
or selective) and at least one opioid. 
 
 
Sociodemographic and other health data. The following data was collected on survey 
participants ages 20 years and older: sex; age; race; total annual household income; measured height 
and weight (from which body mass index [BMI] in kg/m2 was calculated); cigarette smoking history; 
alcohol consumption history; health insurance or health plan coverage; current overall health status 
rating (with possible responses ranging from poor to excellent); depression symptoms (i.e., feeling 
down/depressed/hopeless or anhedonia, half the days or more, over the previous two weeks); visit to a 
mental health care professional during the previous year; and, self-reported, doctor-diagnosed chronic 
bronchitis or emphysema (the presence of either of which was used to denote chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease [COPD]), arthritis, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, stroke and any 
cancer.  
 
Sex, age and race were evaluated in relation to inappropriate psychoactive polypharmacy, since 
differences are known to exist regarding benzodiazepine use and opioid use among women versus 
men,18,21,24-29 older adults versus younger adults,18,21, 24-29 and Caucasians versus non-Caucasians.18,21,24,28-
29 For the purposes of this study, participant age was organized into a three-level variable (20-30 years 
old, 31-59 years old and 60+ years old) and race was organized into a four-level variable (Caucasian,

Black, Mexican-American and other). In order to evaluate if low income was associated with 
inappropriate psychoactive polypharmacy, a two-level variable was created from total annual household 
income data (<$20,000/year versus >$20,000/year). The relationship between overweight/obesity and 
inappropriate psychoactive polypharmacy was evaluated because overweight/obesity is linked with 
obstructive sleep apnea and some studies have shown that using benzodiazepines30-33 or opioids34-36 can 
worsen sleep breathing disorder. Following World Health Organization cut-offs,37 BMI data was 
categorized into the following three groups: <24.99 kg/m2; 25.00-29.99 kg/m2; and, >30.00 kg/m2. 
Smoking and problem drinking were each evaluated in relation to inappropriate psychoactive 
polypharmacy in order to determine if these forms of substance use were potentially associated with 
excess psychoactive drug utilization. Smoking data was categorized into a three-level variable: never-
smoking (defined as having smoked less than 100 cigarettes during one's life); former smoking; and, 
current smoking. A 'problem drinking' variable was constructed from alcohol consumption data and 
'problem drinking' was defined as having more than 2 drinks the average day over the past year. The 
cut-off of more than 2 drinks per day to denote problem drinking was based on National Institute on 
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism recommendations.38 Finally, inappropriate psychoactive polypharmacy 
was examined in relation to the various physical and mental health conditions listed above, because 
benzodiazepines and opioids have been previously reported to be associated with adverse outcomes in 
relation to these conditions.16,39-43 Because psychiatric comorbidity is an important factor influencing 
psychoactive medication receipt, and because depression was the only mental health condition that 
NHANES directly collected information on, the variable 'visit to a mental health care professional in the 
previous year' was included as a proxy for other forms of psychiatric disease.

Statistical methods. For each NHANES cycle, prevalences of the following were estimated: non-
selective benzodiazepine receptor modulator use; selective benzodiazepine receptor modulator use; 
concurrent non-selective and selective benzodiazepine receptor modulator use; any benzodiazepine 
receptor modulator use; opioid use; and, concurrent benzodiazepine receptor modulator and opioid 
usage. The prevalence of concurrent non-selective and selective benzodiazepine receptor modulator 
usage among users of any benzodiazepine or Z-drug was estimated combining all NHANES cycles 
together. The prevalence of benzodiazepine receptor modulator and opioid co-usage among users of 
any benzodiazepine receptor modulator and users of any opioid was also estimated combining all 
NHANES cycles together. 
 
 
For the following groups, sociodemographic and health characteristics were examined using 
descriptive statistics: non-selective benzodiazepine receptor modulator users; selective benzodiazepine 
receptor modulator users; users of non-selective and selective benzodiazepine receptor modulators 
concurrently; users of any benzodiazepine receptor modulator; opioid users; and, users of a 
benzodiazepine receptor modulator and an opioid concurrently. Among users of both a non-selective 
and selective benzodiazepine receptor modulator, and among users of both a benzodiazepine receptor 
modulator and an opioid, forced entry multiple logistic regression was used to identify independent 
sociodemographic and health risk factors for concurrent drug use. All the variables listed in Table 3 were 
included in a single regression equation and adjusted odds ratios (OR) for concurrent drug usage were 
estimated, along with associated 95% confidence intervals (CI). The sociodemographic and health 
characteristics analysis was based on data from only the 2005-2014 NHANES cycles, since only these 
cycles contained information on all the variables listed above for participants ages 20 years and older. 
 
All analyses were performed on SAS version 9.3. NHANES uses a complex sampling design, 
involving stratification and multi-stage clustering.23 Therefore, all point estimates were appropriately

weighted using the survey sample weights provided. Combined new sample weights were appropriately 
created given that multiple NHANES cycles were used. To account for the effects of stratification and 
clustering on variance estimates, Taylor linearization procedures were performed on all confidence 
intervals using stratum and cluster variables provided by NHANES. NHANES considers estimates to be 
statistically reliable from a sample size perspective when: 1) the relative standard error is <30%; and, 2) 
estimated differences between domains of at least 10% are detectable with a type I error rate of <0.05 
and a type II error rate of <0.10.44 To satisfy the first condition, NHANES has estimated that a sample size 
of about 150 is needed, and to satisfy the second condition, a sample size of about 420 is needed. 44 All 
statistically unreliable results that did not meet the aforementioned conditions have been denoted as 
such, but in keeping with NHANES reporting rules, they have not been suppressed because they may still 
be important to report.44 Since this study involved analysis of legally- and publically-accessible 
anonymized data, research ethics approval was not required as per the Tri-Council Policy Statement.45 
Ethics approval to conduct NHANES and documented consent from survey participants was obtained by 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
 
RESULTS 
 
Prevalence results. The prevalence of opioid use in the United States in 2013-2014 was 4.41%, 
equating to about 14 million individuals. Prevalent opioid use increased from 1999-2000 until 2003-
2004, but then plateaued or slightly decreased in subsequent years. The prevalence of any 
benzodiazepine receptor modulator use in the United States in 2013-2014 was 5.33%, equating to about 
17 million people (Figure 1). Prevalent use of any benzodiazepine receptor modulator progressively rose 
from 2.34% in 1999-2000, reflecting absolute and relative increases of +2.99% and +128%, respectively.

The prevalence of benzodiazepine and opioid co-usage was 1.36% in 2013-2014, equating to about 4.3 
million people. The prevalence of concurrent benzodiazepine receptor modulator and opioid usage 
increased from 0.39% in 1999-2000, reflecting absolute and relative changes of +0.97% and +249%, 
respectively. On combining the 1999-2014 NHANES cycles, 23.0% of benzodiazepine receptor modulator 
users were found to also be using an opioid and 19.5% of opioid users were found to be concurrently 
using a benzodiazepine receptor modulator. 
 
The prevalence of non-selective benzodiazepine receptor modulator use in the United States in 
2013-2014 was 4.23%, equating to about 13.4 million people (Figure 2). Non-selective benzodiazepine 
receptor modulator use steadily rose from 2.02% in 1999-2000, reflecting absolute and relative 
increases of +2.21% and +109%, respectively.  The prevalence of selective benzodiazepine receptor 
modulator (or Z-drug) use in the United States in 2013-2014 was 1.57%, equating to about 5 million 
people. Selective benzodiazepine receptor modulator use progressively rose from 0.37% in 1999-2000, 
reflecting absolute and relative increases of +1.20% and +324%, respectively. The prevalence of non-
selective and selective benzodiazepine receptor modulator co-use in the in the United States in 2013-
2014 was 0.47%, equating to about 1.5 million people. The prevalence of non-selective and selective 
benzodiazepine receptor modulator co-use steadily rose from 0.05% in 1999-2000, reflecting absolute 
and relative increases of +0.42% and +840%, respectively. Out of the 2075 non-selective or selective 
benzodiazepine receptor modulator users in the combined 1999-2014 NHANES cycles, 118 or 5.7% were 
concurrently receiving both a non-selective and selective benzodiazepine receptor modulator.

Risk factors for drug usage. The sociodemographic and health characteristics of non-selective 
benzodiazepine receptor modulator users, selective benzodiazepine receptor modulator users and 
opioid users are presented in Table 2. 
 
Among individuals receiving either a benzodiazepine receptor modulator or an opioid, 
significantly increased adjusted odds of benzodiazepine receptor modulator-opioid co-usage were found 
among current smokers (OR 2.03; 95% CI 1.36-3.03), individuals having visited with a mental health care 
professional in the previous year (OR 1.51; 95% CI 1.01-2.25) and among individuals with arthritis (OR 
1.68; 95% CI 1.13-2.48). Significantly decreased adjusted odds for benzodiazepine- receptor modulator-
opioid co-usage were found among African-Americans (OR 0.46; 95% CI 0.30-0.70), Hispanics (OR 0.62; 
95% CI 0.40-0.97) and those who rated their overall health as excellent/very good/good (OR 0.57; 95% 
CI 0.39-0.83). No significant associations were observed between benzodiazepine receptor modulator-
opioid co-usage and any other variables. 
 
Among individuals receiving either a non-selective or a selective benzodiazepine receptor 
modulator, significantly increased adjusted odds of concurrent non-selective and selective 
benzodiazepine receptor modulator usage were found among morbidly obese individuals (OR 2.50; 95% 
CI 1.16-5.37) and individuals with depression symptoms (OR 2.03; 95% CI 1.01-4.06) (Table 3). In 
contrast, significantly reduced adjusted odds of concurrent non-selective and selective benzodiazepine 
receptor modulator usage were observed among individuals with 'other' ethnicity (OR 0.06; 95% CI 0.01-
0.49) and individuals with a history of ischemic heart disease (OR 0.16; 95% CI 0.04-0.74). No other 
significant associations were found between concurrent non-selective and selective benzodiazepine 
receptor modulator usage and any other variables.

DISCUSSION 
 
Concurrent use of benzodiazepine receptor modulators and opioids, and concurrent use of non-
selective and selective benzodiazepine receptor modulators, have both progressively increased in the 
United States between 1999-2000 and 2013-2014. Increasing benzodiazepine receptor modulator and 
opioid co-usage has been previously reported in the general United States population using national 
prescription dispensing data9 and national physician survey data.10 A similar increasing trend in non-
selective and selective benzodiazepine receptor modulator co-prescription has recently been reported 
in the general Irish population,22 but this is the first study to report on trends in the prevalence of non-
selective and selective benzodiazepine receptor modulator co-use in the United States. While the 
absolute proportion of individuals in United States receiving both these forms of potentially 
inappropriate psychoactive polypharmacy may seem small (e.g., concurrent benzodiazepine receptor 
modulator and opioid use was 1.36% in 2013-2014 and concurrent use of non-selective and selective 
benzodiazepine receptor modulators was 0.47% in 2013-2014), these percentages at a population-level 
correspond to millions people.  
 
The substantially increased risks of morbidity and mortality associated with benzodiazepine 
receptor modulator-opioid co-usage are well-documented5-8 and the US FDA has gone as far as to issue 
its strongest form of safety warning about this suboptimal prescribing practice.4 Unfortunately, the date 
of issuing of this safety warning (i.e., late September 2017) came well after the data used in this study, 
so it was not possible to ascertain in this study if the safety warning had any effect on benzodiazepine-
opioid usage in the population. The progressive rise in concurrent use of non-selective and selective 
benzodiazepine receptor modulators is also concerning, given the many serious potential adverse 
effects of these drugs. Adverse events associated with benzodiazepine receptor modulators include 
abuse,14,46 withdrawal symptoms,47 impaired cognitive function,48 dementia,49-50 motor vehicle

accidents,51-52 falls,7,53 fractures54 and pneumonia.16,39,55-56 Risks for benzodiazepine-related adverse 
effects may be magnified by concomitant use of a non-selective and selective benzodiazepine receptor 
modulator, but further research is needed to confirm this. One study involving individuals with COPD 
found that concurrent receipt of non-selective and selective benzodiazepine receptor modulators 
resulted in higher odds of respiratory failure compared to use of one these drug classes alone, with non-
benzodiazepine users serving as the reference group.16  
 
The reasons underlying the progressive increases in concurrent use of benzodiazepine receptor 
modulators and opioids, and non-selective and selective benzodiazepine receptor modulators, cannot 
be elucidated in this study. Multiple factors may be contributing to these forms of psychoactive 
medication polypharmacy: situations of multiple prescribers for an individual patient; patients 
potentially not following appropriate consumption instructions when more than psychoactive 
medication is prescribed; and, an increasing number of medically complex and demanding patients (e.g., 
individuals with concomitant psychiatric disease and chronic pain). Prescribers' potential lack of 
awareness that Z-drugs belong to the benzodiazepine receptor modulator family may be one 
contributing factor to the rise specifically of non-selective and selective benzodiazepine receptor 
modulator co-usage. While non-selective benzodiazepine receptor modulators are potentially easily 
identifiable to prescribers as benzodiazepine drugs because they often end with the syllable –pam or –
lam, selective benzodiazepine receptor modulators do not have this characteristic nomenclature. 
Instead, selective benzodiazepine  receptor modulators have been traditionally called "Z-drugs" and this 
naming may create a false distinction in prescribers' minds that these drugs belong to a separate, non-
benzodiazepine drug class. Indeed, selective benzodiazepine receptor modulators or Z-drugs have been 
incorrectly labelled as "non-benzodiazepines"14-21 in many published reports.

The rise in non-selective and selective benzodiazepine receptor modulator co-usage in the 
United States is occurring on the background of increasing non-selective benzodiazepine drug use and 
selective benzodiazepine drug use, separately. Rising prescription of Z-drugs has been previously 
reported in the United States population18 and this trend may relate to non-evidence-based perceptions 
among general practitioners17,57,58 and pharmacists17 that selective benzodiazepine receptor modulators 
are more effective and less harmful than their non-selective counterparts. The fact that Z-drugs came 
more recently on the US market (in the 1990s) compared to non-selective benzodiazepine drugs (which 
have been available since the early 1960s) may have contributed to false perceptions of increased drug 
efficacy and safety, as a result of "new drug" bias. Increasing Z-drug use may also be explained by a ris-
ing awareness in society of insomnia and its potential consequences, or by a rise in insomnia symptoms 
in the population, since Z-drugs are specifically approved as sleep aids. In contrast to some previous 
North American reports,24-25,59 this analysis found that non-selective benzodiazepine receptor modulator 
use in the United States is also rising (and not decreasing) over time. The discrepancy in non-selective 
benzodiazepine receptor modulator utilization trends between this and some previous studies24-25,59 
may in part relate to different time periods or specific populations (e.g., older adults only versus the 
general population) evaluated. In contrast to the progressive rise in use of benzodiazepine receptor 
modulators during the study period, opioid use plateaued or slightly decreased from about 2003-2004 
onwards, such that the prevalence of benzodiazepine receptor modulator use exceeded that of opioid 
use starting in 2013-2014. Even though overall opioid use plateaued or slightly decreased in recent 
years, concurrent use of opioids and benzodiazepine receptor modulators did not and instead increased. 
The recent, promising trend in overall opioid use is consistent with what has been reported by others60 
and the recent stabilization of prescription opioid usage is undoubtedly related to the many dedicated 
efforts and interventions in the United States to improve opioid prescribing.60 Similar efforts for

optimizing benzodiazepine receptor modulator use are also likely needed, given the increasing use of 
this drug class.  
 
Although it is known that women are generally more likely to receive benzodiazepines18,21,24-27 
and opioids28-29 compared to men, there was no significant association in this study between sex and 
benzodiazepine receptor modulator and opioid co-usage or with concurrent use of non-selective and 
selective benzodiazepine receptor modulators, among individuals already using a benzodiazepine 
receptor modulator or an opioid. While older adults have also been previously found to be more likely 
to receive benzodiazepines18,21,24-27 and opioids, 28-29 in this study there were trends towards older adults 
being less likely to concurrently use a benzodiazepine receptor modulator and opioid or a non-selective 
and selective benzodiazepine receptor modulator, among individuals already using a benzodiazepine 
receptor modulator or opioid. These finding may be explained by prescriber concerns regarding 
psychoactive drug polypharmacy in older adults, who are vulnerable to medication side-effects. Similar 
to patterns of opioid use in the general population, concurrent use of an opioid and a benzodiazepine 
receptor modulator was more likely among Caucasians versus several other ethnic groups.28-29 While 
Caucasian race has been previously reported to be a risk factor for benzodiazepine prescription,18,21,24 
Caucasians were not more likely in this study to concurrently receive a non-selective and selective 
benzodiazepine receptor modulator compared to African- and Mexican-Americans. Compared to 
Caucasians, individuals of 'other' ethnicity (i.e., non-African-American and non-Hispanic) were 
significantly less likely to concurrently receive a non-selective and selective benzodiazepine receptor 
modulator. This finding may reflect a lower prevalence of insomnia and/or psychiatric disease, or a 
disparity in the management of these conditions, in these non-Caucasian ethnic groups. While some 
previous studies observed benzodiazepine use to be more frequent among cigarette smokers26,61 and 
those with a history of problem drinking,61 these forms of substance abuse were favourably not found to

be associated non-selective and selective benzodiazepine receptor modulator co-usage. In contrast, 
current smokers were more likely to be users of benzodiazepine receptor modulators and opioids 
simultaneously. This is potentially concerning, because smoking is strong risk factor for developing 
obstructive airways disease and heightened respiratory-related morbidity and mortality have been 
observed among users of benzodiazepines or opioids with COPD.16,39,62 Both concurrent benzodiazepine 
receptor modulator and opioid use, and non-selective and selective benzodiazepine receptor modulator 
use, were unsurprisingly associated with indicators for the presence of psychiatric disease, since issues 
of chronic pain, insomnia and anxiety frequently co-exist among individuals with psychiatric 
comorbidity. Similarly, having arthritis was unsurprisingly associated with benzodiazepine-opioid co-
usage, since chronic pain (and possible consequent insomnia and anxiety) can occur with arthritis. 
 
One factor in this study that was strikingly associated with simultaneous use of non-selective 
and selective benzodiazepine receptor modulators among benzodiazepine drug users was morbid 
obesity. However, there were no significant associations observed between body mass index and 
benzodiazepine receptor modulator-opioid co-usage. Morbid obesity has been previously reported to be 
associated with increased use of sedative drugs.63 Benzodiazepine drug use could theoretically lead to 
obesity, but the reverse could also be true. Benzodiazepine drug use has been associated with 
decreased physical activity level,64 which could then contribute to the development of obesity. Because 
obesity is associated with nocturia65 and musculoskeletal pains,66 which are causes for insomnia, 
morbidly obese individuals may be then more likely to use benzodiazepine drugs. Obesity is also a well-
known risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia symptoms frequently co-exist among 
individuals with obstructive sleep apnea.67-68 Concurrent usage of non-selective and selective 
benzodiazepine receptor modulators among morbidly obese individuals is potentially concerning,

because benzodiazepine drugs may worsen untreated sleep breathing disorder,30-33 although this has 
not been consistently found.69-73 
 
Strengths of this study include that results were based on nearly two decades of relatively large, 
nationally-representative data. Psychoactive medication use was also objectively confirmed in a large 
majority of NHANES participants and not simply based on self-report. Limitations of this study include 
that drug use was only evaluated within 30 days prior to survey administration. Therefore, total 
psychoactive medication utilization during the year among survey participants may be higher than what 
has been estimated. NHANES also only collected information on prescription use, and not non-
prescription drug use or use of other individuals' prescription supplies, which may again have under-
estimated total medication use. NHANES asked only about usage, and not receipt of, prescription 
medications, and it is possible that more participants were prescribed benzodiazepine receptor 
modulators or opioids by health care professionals, but that these prescriptions were not filled and 
subsequently used. Some individuals that had received multiple psychoactive medications within the 
past 30 days may not have in fact taken the multiple drugs on the same day, but staggered them on 
different days, so frequency of medication co-usage may also be over-estimated. Information on drug 
dose and other patterns of drug use (e.g., new versus repeat prescriptions, early refills, etc.) were 
unavailable in NHANES. NHANES did not collect information from participants about the reasons 
underlying particular drug use patterns. NHANES also does not make available information on 
participant geographical residence, so it was possible to describe potential regional variation in 
psychoactive medication polypharmacy. Analyses were not adjusted for the presence of other mental 
health comorbidities, besides depression, as such information was not available in NHANES. However, 
visit to a mental health care professional in the past year was included as a covariate in the analysis, 
which is a proxy indicator for the presence of mental health comorbidity. It should be noted that this

was a case-only analysis, as individuals with missing drug or covariate information were not included or 
accounted for in the analyses. Finally, the analyses of psychoactive medication polypharmacy in this 
study were based on sample sizes that fell below NHANES' recommendations, and therefore, all findings 
should be interpreted with caution and be considered exploratory in nature. 
 
In conclusion, this exploratory analysis showed that while overall opioid use in the United States 
has favourably plateaued or slightly decreased in recent years, benzodiazepine receptor modulator-
opioid co-usage has instead paradoxically steadily increased. Similarly, concurrent use of non-selective 
and selective benzodiazepine receptor modulators has also progressively risen in the United States. The 
reasons for the increases in these two forms of inappropriate psychoactive polypharmacy require 
clarification and are potentially multi-fold. Prescribers' potential lack of awareness that Z-drugs are 
indeed benzodiazepine receptor modulators may be one contributing factor to concurrent usage of non-
selective and selective benzodiazepines. Discarding the term "Z-drug" from our pharmacologic lexicon 
and more appropriately identifying selective benzodiazepine receptor modulators may help minimize 
confusion among prescribers, and as a result, inappropriate psychoactive drug polypharmacy. The rise in 
concurrent use of benzodiazepine receptor modulators and opioids, and non-selective and selective 
benzodiazepine receptor modulators, is concerning, because these forms of suboptimal drug utilization 
put recipients at elevated risk for serious drug-related adverse events.

Figure 1 footnote (to be placed at bottom of figure): *Results should be interpreted with caution, as 
they are based on sample sizes that fall below NHANES' criteria for statistical reliability. The 1999-2000 
opioid prevalence estimate was also statistical unreliable. It should be noted though that the 2009-2010
