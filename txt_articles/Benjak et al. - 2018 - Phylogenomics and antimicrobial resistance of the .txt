Phylogenomics and antimicrobial resistance of the
leprosy bacillus Mycobacterium leprae
Andrej Benjak et al.#
Leprosy is a chronic human disease caused by the yet-uncultured pathogen Mycobacterium leprae.
Although readily curable with multidrug therapy (MDT), over 200,000 new cases are still
reported annually. Here, we obtain M. leprae genome sequences from DNA extracted directly from
patients’ skin biopsies using a customized protocol. Comparative and phylogenetic analysis of 154
genomes from 25 countries provides insight into evolution and antimicrobial resistance, unco-
vering lineages and phylogeographic trends, with the most ancestral strains linked to the Far East.
In addition to known MDT-resistance mutations, we detect other mutations associated with
antibiotic resistance, and retrace a potential stepwise emergence of extensive drug resistance in
the pre-MDT era. Some of the previously undescribed mutations occur in genes that are appar-
ently subject to positive selection, and two of these (ribD, fadD9) are restricted to drug-resistant
strains. Finally, nonsense mutations in the nth excision repair gene are associated with greater
sequence diversity and drug resistance.

 M
ycobacterium leprae is the main causative agent of
leprosy, a disease that affects the skin, nerves, and
mucosa of the upper respiratory tract in humans1. A
second, distantly related leprosy bacillus, Mycobacterium lepro-
matosis, was recently discovered in humans and red squirrels
(Sciurus vulgaris)2. Leprosy is curable with multidrug therapy
(MDT), but remains a public health problem in South America,
Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and Micronesia, where over
200,000 new leprosy cases are reported each year3. MDT, com-
prising rifampicin, dapsone, and clofazimine, has been used
intensively since the 1980s and a few second-line drugs, ofloxacin,
minocycline, and clarithromycin, are sometimes employed as
therapeutic agents4. The emergence of drug-resistant (DR) and
multidrug-resistant (MDR) M. leprae is increasingly reported5–12.
For dapsone, rifampicin and ofloxacin, the resistance mechanism
has been attributed to missense mutations in the drug resistance
determining regions (DRDR) of the folP1, rpoB, and gyrA genes,
respectively.
M. leprae is an obligate intracellular pathogen that has never
been cultured axenically but can infect wild or experimental
animals. The nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) or
the mouse footpad (MFP) can be used to produce bacilli, but both
methods are cumbersome and time-consuming13. The genome of
M. leprae is the smallest among mycobacteria (3.3 Mb) with 1614
genes encoding proteins and a remarkable 1300 pseudogenes14.
Such reductive evolution is a hallmark of bacteria that have
changed
their
lifestyle
from
free-living
to
strictly
host-
associated15. Due to its 14-day generation time and the absence
of horizontal gene transfer, the genome of M. leprae is highly
conserved, with <300 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
observed between distantly related strains, and only a few SNPs
between close relatives5,16–18. Four SNP types (branches 1–4) and
16 SNP subtypes (A–P) were defined by surveying 78 informative
SNPs and six single-base insertion/deletions (InDels)16,19. Gen-
otyping a large panel of M. leprae strains revealed strong geo-
graphical
associations
and
suggested
possible
routes
of
dissemination of leprosy16 whereas, a recent phylogenetic analysis
of 16 whole-genome sequences of modern and ancient M. leprae
strains, implicated the 3K subtype (branch 0) as the most
ancestral17.
Leprosy seems to have appeared during the Iron Age
(1200–600 BC) and the date of the most recent common ancestor
of M. leprae was estimated to be from 2543 BC to 36 AD, based
on whole-genome sequence analysis17. Similarly, the earliest
accepted written record of leprosy is from 600 BC20, and the
earliest osteological evidence dates from around 300 BC21–25. The
oldest genomic evidence of leprosy is for samples from 80 to 240
AD in Central Asia26.
In this study, we develop and apply methods to isolate and
purify M. leprae DNA that enable whole genome sequences to be
obtained directly from human biopsy material, thus removing the
necessity for passage through animals. This approach was suc-
cessfully used to generate 120 new M. leprae genome sequences
from drug-susceptible and DR strains from around the world,
thereby enabling detailed phylogenetic and phylogeographic
comparisons to be performed, new mutations associated with
antimicrobial resistance to be detected, and the likely origin of
leprosy to be proposed.
Results
Isolating M. leprae DNA from human skin biopsies. Genome
sequencing has become routine practice in microbiology27,
especially for micro-organisms that can be readily isolated, which
is not the case of the leprosy bacillus. For decades, the sole source
of M. leprae DNA suitable for genomics was from bacteria
isolated 12 months after infection of armadillos or mice. Recently,
we have developed and optimized methods that enable M. leprae
DNA to be extracted directly from fresh or formalin-fixed skin
biopsies from leprosy patients28. These methods include enrich-
ment of M. leprae DNA by array capture17 but this is less prac-
tical for large population-based investigations.
The DNA extraction method used in this study was applied
directly to punch biopsies from clinically well-characterized
patients of known bacillary index (BI) and exploits the fact that
M. leprae resides intracellularly. Host cells are first disrupted and
their DNA degraded, leaving the bacilli intact. The bacilli are then
lysed and their DNA extracted and used for library preparation.
This approach was applied to 106 biopsies whose BI ranged from
0 (no bacilli visible) to 6 (>1000 bacilli per microscopic field)
thereby enabling a relationship between BI and sequencing
efficiency to be established (Fig. 1). As expected, there was a direct
correlation between genome coverage and the BI but, surpris-
ingly, successful coverage could even be achieved with some
specimens whose BI was as low as 1+.
Genome analysis of patient and animal cohort. We analyzed a
total of 154 M. leprae genomes from 25 countries (Fig. 2, Sup-
plementary Data 1), of which 120 were newly sequenced and 34
were previously published (Supplementary Data 1). The cohort
comprised 147 human samples, 6 from red squirrels and 1 from
an armadillo that were all naturally infected. Genome sequences
were obtained directly from 109 human samples, 30 from bacilli
passaged in mice, and 8 from armadillos. Thirty of these strains
were from patients who had relapsed or not responded to MDT
the remainder (124) were from supposedly drug-susceptible
strains (87 were from confirmed primary cases, while disease
history was unknown for the others).
A total of 3053 SNPs and 219 InDels (excluding tandem
repeats) was found (Supplementary Data 2). The average SNP
difference among the 154 genomes was 114. We found a total of
988 non-synonymous alleles (0.62 per protein-coding gene, or
0.61 per kb of protein-coding genes) and 530 synonymous SNPs
(0.33 per protein-coding gene or 0.33 per kb of protein-coding
genes), and 1763 mutations in intergenic regions and pseudo-
genes
(1.07
mutations
per
kb
of
intergenic
regions
and
pseudogenes). The SNP density for each gene is given in
Supplementary Data 2. Of the 219 InDels, 58 (27%) were in
protein-coding genes.

 Phylogeny of M. leprae. Phylogenetic analysis using both max-
imum parsimony (MP) and Bayesian inference resulted in con-
sistent
tree
topologies
and
revealed
distinct
lineages
and
sublineages of M. leprae (Fig. 3). Strains belonging to the same
SNP subtypes16 clustered within single branches, with the
exception of SNP subtype 3K, which is represented by a newly
discovered ancestral lineage, termed here 3K-1, and the ancestral
lineage referred to earlier as branch 017 and termed here 3K-0
(Fig. 3a). All strains from the two most ancestral lineages, 3K-0
and 3K-1, originated from Japan (8), China (1), Korea (1), the
Marshall Islands (1), and New Caledonia (1), in agreement with
earlier genotyping studies of hundreds of M. leprae strains which
confirmed the predominance of the 3K genotype in East Asia,
notably in Japan, China, and Korea16,29–31.
M. leprae in East Africa showed higher diversity with subtypes
2E, 2F, and 2H representing distinct lineages (Fig. 3a). The
geographic
distribution
of
those
lineages
corroborates
the
findings of earlier studies reporting the presence of SNP type 2
in Medieval Europe, the Middle East and East Africa16. Two
Ethiopian isolates, belonging to the 2F subtype, clustered closely
with medieval European strains dating from the 11th to 12th
century (Fig. 3), which supports the hypothesis that the ancient
Greek and Roman routes32 connecting Europe, the Middle East,
East Africa, and South Asia16,33–35 contributed to the dissemina-
tion of SNP type 2 M. leprae.
West Africa, on the other hand, harbors exclusively SNP type
4, suggesting that overland migration between East and West
Africa was limited. SNP subtypes 4N, 4O, and 4P, albeit sharing
the same ancestor, do not form a monophyletic clade as
previously hypothesized16. Rather, the 4O and 4P subtypes
cluster together in a branch distinct from 4N (Fig. 3).
Brazil, as expected, contains a great diversity of several M.
leprae lineages, with the SNP type 4 and SNP subtype 3I being the
most prevalent36. The 3I genotype was common in medieval
Europe17,21,37,38, and is still present in red squirrels in the United
Kingdom2. The modern Brazilian strain Br2016-45 branched
between two medieval strains from Europe (Fig. 3), making it the
most ancestral contemporary 3I strain in the Americas to date.
The broad diversity of 3I genotypes from Brazil probably derives
from multiple introductions from Europe. On the other hand, the
strains circulating in the Southern USA and associated with
zoonosis from the nine-banded armadillo, I-30, NHDP-55 and
NHDP-6318, originated much more recently (Fig. 3b), in
agreement with the rapid expansion and spread of the armadillo
population since its introduction to this region about 150 years
ago39.
Good representation of most M. leprae lineages enabled
identification of lineage-specific markers. A set of 235 SNPs
and 25 InDels were specific to single lineages or groups of related
lineages (Supplementary Data 2), of which 73 non-synonymous
SNPs and 5 InDels were within protein-coding genes. These new
lineage-specific markers can be used for future genotyping
schemes.
Dating analysis. Dating analysis of M. leprae (Fig. 3b and Sup-
plementary Figure 1) was done using BEAST v2.4.440 and the
results were very similar to those obtained from a ten-fold smaller
number of contemporary isolates17. The most recent common
ancestor (TMRCA) of all M. leprae strains was estimated to be
3699 years old (95% Highest Posterior Density (HPD) 2731–4838
ya) and the substitution rate was 7.8 × 10−9 per site per year.
Overlapping results were obtained when using different models
(Supplementary Note and Supplementary Table 1), indicating
that the dataset was robust and sufficiently informative.
A striking observation is the relative youth of the SNP type 1
lineage and its association with South Asia (Fig. 3b). Earlier
studies revealed a predominance of SNP subtype 1D in India and
Nepal, followed by 1C, 1A16, and 2E, 2G, and 2H33–35. SNP type
1 predominates in Thailand41, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and
Philippines16. The current phylogeography of M. leprae implies
that humans brought leprosy to South Asia from other parts of
the continent.
Hypermutated M. leprae strains. Eight M. leprae strains (85054,
S15, Amami, Zensho-4, Zensho-5, Zensho-9, Br14-3, and Br2016-
15), belonging to five different SNP subtypes, had unusually long
branches in the MP tree (Fig. 3a) because they contained on
average 92 more SNPs than the other strains but approximately
the same number of InDels. Comparative analysis revealed one
unique feature linking the observed “hypermutated” strains,
namely deleterious mutations in the endonuclease III gene nth
(ML2301) due to frameshifts and premature stop codons
(Table 1).
Drug resistance. DR-associated SNPs were detected in the DRDR
in 24 strains for folP1, 11 strains for rpoB, and 2 strains for gyrA
(in bold in Table 1). Previously described mutations were iden-
tified in folP1 at codons 53 (n = 7) and 55 (n = 17), except in one
isolate (Bn8-52), which had mutations at codons 55 and 145.
Eleven strains had known mutations that confer rifampicin
resistance in their rpoB-DRDR, while two strains (Kutatsu-6 and
S15) harbor one additional mutation, and one (Br14-3) has two

 additional mutations in the DRDR (Table 1). One of these
additional mutations (G432S) does not confer rifampicin resis-
tance to recombinant Mycobacterium smegmatis42 whereas no
information is available for the remaining three (T433I, G448D,
and T508I) except that the G448A substitution does confer
rifampicin resistance in M. tuberculosis43. Also, 5 of the 11
rifampicin-resistant strains had additional missense mutations in
rpoB (85054, Br14-4, Zensho-4, Zensho-5, and Zensho-9) while
2 strains (ARLP_08 and S9) presented non-synonymous SNPs
outside the DRDR (Fig. 4). Compensatory mutations in rpoA and
rpoC, encoding the alpha and beta-prime subunits of RNA
polymerase, can occur in rifampicin-resistant M. tuberculosis44.
We found one non-synonymous SNP in rpoA, substitution T187P
in the rifampicin-resistant strain Br14-5, and seven non-
synonymous SNPs in rpoC (Supplementary Data 2), of which
two occurred in the drug-resistant strains S15 (A258T) and
Zensho-4 (H1133Y).
Two strains had known quinolone resistance mutations in the
DRDR of gyrA and six harbored different single mutations
elsewhere in the gene. Three isolates had a missense mutation in
gyrB, including two within the DRDR (Table 1). Five strains
harbor deleterious mutations in the ethA gene, encoding a mono-
oxygenase that activates thioamide prodrugs in M. tuberculo-
sis45,46. Interestingly, in addition to ethA and nth, three genes
(fadD9, ribD, pks4) were mutated almost exclusively in MDR
strains occurring 18, 19, and 4 times, respectively (Table 1).

 varying duration7,8. Since genomics uncovered new mutations
that are associated with antimicrobial resistance in other bacteria,
such as those in ethA and gyrB, this prompted us to try and
retrieve the clinical records of six patients whose strains displayed
resistance to three or more drugs (dapsone, rifampicin, quino-
lones, and thioamides). Four of these extensively drug-resistant
(XDR) strains were from multibacillary patients in Japan who had
received a succession of monotherapies in the pre-MDT era and
our genome analysis enabled the chronology of resistance emer-
gence to be retraced. This is illustrated in Fig. 5, and sadly
exemplified by the strain from patient Zensho-4 who was diag-
nosed in 1963 and first treated with protionamide followed by
thiambutosin, both of which show cross-resistance and likely
require activation by the EthA mono-oxidase that acquired the
A25T missense mutation47; then treatment began with dapsone
leading to emergence of the T53I mutation in folP1, followed by
rifapentine that selected the S456L mutation in rpoB, and con-
tinued with ofloxacin, to which resistance arose from the A91V
mutation in gyrA and D464N in gyrB. Molecular drug suscept-
ibility testing was performed in 1998 and the patient finally cured
by a regimen comprising clofazimine, minocycline, chlor-
amphenicol and levofloxacin/sparfloxacin. The fifth XDR strain
was from a newly diagnosed Brazilian case (Br2016-15) with no
history of treatment for leprosy, confirming the ongoing trans-
mission of primary antimicrobial resistance, while details of the
sixth case could not be recovered.
Genes under positive selection. We also identified genes con-
taining an unusually high number of polymorphisms, multiple
alleles, and homoplasies (Supplementary Figure 2), which could
be indicative of positive selection48. Strikingly, the distribution of
these polymorphic sites around the genome was not random as
they were often clustered, especially proximal to either side of the
origin of replication (Supplementary Figure 3). Protein-changing
mutations were found in 540 genes, with an average of 1.77
mutations per gene (STD 2.12). Table 2 contains a ranking of
genes with at least five non-synonymous mutations or regions
with one or more homoplasy (excluding VNTRs). The most
polymorphic gene by far was ML041149 encoding the serine-rich
antigen, a member of the immunogenic, surface-exposed PPE
protein family. Two other known T-cell antigens whose genes
display variability are Lsr2 and EsxA (Table 2). Other than nth,

Discussion
Here we have optimized and applied highly sensitive procedures
to extract M. leprae DNA directly from human skin biopsies that
is suitable for whole-genome sequencing. The resultant genome
sequences were analyzed phylogenetically and used to retrace the
origin of the leprosy bacillus, and to identify polymorphisms that
had been positively selected during evolution. Such polymorph-
isms might reflect pressure from the human immune system,
from MDT or other forces.
It is striking that the ancestral lineages of M. leprae pre-
dominate in East Asia, although we should keep in mind that
Central Asia has been understudied, so it would be interesting to
sequence more samples spanning the East–West axis of Asia,
including the Middle East, where the 3K genotype is also

 present16. Nevertheless, given the current data on the distribution
of the 3K subtype we can deduce that the ancestor of M. leprae
originated within Eurasia, probably in the Far East.
Endonuclease III (Nth) and the formamidopyrimidine and
endonuclease VIII family (Fpg/Nei) of DNA glycosylases are
central to the base excision repair pathway in bacteria50. Myco-
bacterial genomes usually contain a single nth and two fpg/nei
genes but M. leprae has lost both fpg/nei orthologues and retained
the nth gene. Nth, Fpg, and Nei may have overlapping functions
and, in enteric bacteria, mutator phenotypes were observed when
nth was inactivated in combination with the fpg and nei genes51–
53. In M. smegmatis, deletion of nth and both the nei homologs
resulted in elevated spontaneous mutation frequencies and
increased sensitivity to oxidative stress54. Therefore, in the
absence of Nei, inactivation of nth in M. leprae should lead to
increased sequence variability, which is consistent with our
results.
Strikingly, all nth mutants were also drug-resistant so Nth loss
likely favors emergence of drug resistance, and nth mutations
might serve as a surrogate marker for potential drug resistance
and treatment failure. A link between a higher mutation rate and
drug resistance was observed in strains of M. tuberculosis (which
has nth and two fpg/nei genes) belonging to lineage 2, but the
molecular basis for this is unknown55. For a pathogen with an
extremely reduced genome such as M. leprae, a hypermutator
phenotype could be detrimental and ultimately lethal.
Drug resistance is alarming for leprosy control. There is
growing evidence for primary quinolone resistance in strains of
M. leprae from patients who have never been treated with qui-
nolones for leprosy but may have received this drug for other
infections56. Five new GyrA mutations were identified in this
study, but their effect on FQ resistance remains to be determined.
Since two of them arose independently in the GyrA intein, which
is removed by protein splicing, they may not impact quinolone
activity (Fig. 4). Three non-synonymous mutations were found in
gyrB (Table 2) and experimental evidence exists for two of them
conferring quinolone resistance in in vitro assays or in M.
tuberculosis57,58. To our knowledge, this is the first report of M.
leprae clinical isolates harboring mutations in gyrB. Thus, despite
their apparent rarity, mutations in gyrB should be systematically
assessed in drug resistance screening.
A range of known and new mutations was detected in the
DRDR and elsewhere in rpoB (Fig. 4; Table 1). Some of these
might have a compensatory role in restoring fitness, that is known
to be reduced to various degrees in rifampicin-resistant mutants
of M. tuberculosis59,60. Similarly, compensatory mutations in
rpoA and rpoC can occur in rifampicin-resistant M. tubercu-
losis44. The rpoA substitution T187P in the rifampicin-resistant
M. leprae strain Br14-5 was shown to be compensatory in M.
tuberculosis44. Rifampicin-resistant isolates of M. tuberculosis
harbor more mutations in rpoC compared to rifampicin-
susceptible isolates44,61. In our case, we observed no clear cor-
relation between rifampicin resistance and mutations in rpoC,
which occurred in two resistant and two wild-type strains.
Arguably the most intriguing finding of the present investiga-
tion was the remarkably high frequency of mutations in the
fadD9 and ribD genes and in 19/23 cases these occur in strains
that have at least one mutation that is associated with resistance
to a leprosy drug (Fig. 4; Table 1). Functional information for
fadD9 is scarce and the mutations found are predicted to either
abolish protein production (8/16) or to cause detrimental amino
acid changes (Fig. 4). In the case of ribD, 14 different missense
mutations were found in a group of 17 variant alleles, indicating
that this is likely an essential function. From studies with M.
tuberculosis it is known that ribD encodes an alternative dihy-
drofolate reductase, with relatively low activity compared to that
conferred by the bona fide dihydrofolate reductase gene, dfrA62.
In clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis, a promoter mutation causes
overexpression of ribD that is associated with resistance to the old
drug, para-amino salicylic acid (PAS), and to certain DHFR
inhibitors63. This suggests that the mutations detected in the M.
leprae ribD gene may also confer resistance to PAS and support
for this is provided by the fact that vadrine (2-pyridyl-(4)-1,3,4-
oxydiazolone-(5)-p-aminosalicylate) was used as a drug to treat
leprosy before dapsone became widely available64. It is thus
possible that the ribD mutations we report here arose nearly 60
years ago following treatment with vadrine or another PAS
derivative. Our discovery of these mutations and those in fadD9
should encourage further experimentation in order to establish
their true role and contribution to antimicrobial resistance,
especially to clofazimine.
Methods
Sample collection. Samples were taken from leprosy patients as punch biopsies of
skin (preserved in 70% ethanol or formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE)),
which is standard diagnostic procedure for leprosy, or from mouse foot-pads.
Details about the samples used in this study are given in Supplementary Data 1 and
below.
Origin of S15: Strain S15 corresponds to strain 9204165, which was isolated
from a lepromatous leprosy patient originally from Martinique. The origin of S15
was erroneously attributed to New Caledonia in Monot et al.16, and the error was
subsequently propagated in several publications2,17,66,67.

 Origin of the case Ng14-3: We mention in the Results that West Africa harbors
only SNP-type 4 strains. Strain Ng14-35 (subtype 1D) is an exception, but the
patient (a native of Nigeria) developed leprosy during a prolonged stay in Libya.
LRC-1A, an unidentified strain from Japan: A sample obtained from the
Leprosy Research Center (LRC) in Tokyo, initially labeled as Airaku-2, did not
contain the mutations in folP1 and rpoB previously detected in Airaku-2 by PCR
sequencing7. Therefore, we renamed this sample to LRC-1A (standing for SNP
subtype 1A sample from LRC).
DNA extraction and library preparation. DNA was extracted from 101 human
skin biopsies with known BI using a customized in-house protocol combining host
tissue digestion and the QIAmp microbiome kit for host DNA depletion, strong
bacterial cell lysis and silica-based purification. Punch biopsies (6 mm) in 70%
ethanol were first rehydrated in Hank’s balanced solution prior to mincing with
scissors. Cells were detached from the tissue by 30 min incubation at 37 °C with a
mixture of 0.5 U of collagenase and dispase, followed by incubation at 56 °C with
10 mg/ml of trypsin until complete digestion. Free cells were then suspended in 1
ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and DNA was extracted using the QIAmp
DNA microbiome extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s recommenda-
tions. Each run of extraction included a batch of five to nine samples and one blank
control (500 μl of Hank’s balanced solution). The presence of M. leprae was
assessed by PCR using RLEP primers2 prior to library preparation. Libraries were
prepared from 50 µl of extracted DNA using the Kapa Hyperprep kit as described
previously2,5. DNA from FFPE samples was extracted using the truXTRACTM
FFPE DNA kit (Covaris) as described previously28. Libraries prepared from the
extracted DNA were used directly for shotgun sequencing. M. leprae DNA
extraction quality was assessed from the percentage of M. leprae DNA present in
the library inferred by alignment to the reference genome sequence, with a mini-
mum threshold set at 1%. This threshold was chosen because it yields an average
genome coverage of at least 5× per sample in a multiplexed run of 10 samples on
one HiSeq 2500 lane (yielding around 20 million reads per sample and 100 bases
per read).
Library enrichment. Libraries with low M. leprae content underwent enrichment
using whole-genome tiling arrays as described previously17. Briefly, Illumina
libraries were hybridized onto custom Agilent SureSelect Capture Arrays con-
taining ca. one million DNA probes (60 bp) spanning the entire M. leprae genome
(tiled every 4 bp), followed by elution and PCR amplification.
Sequencing. Sequencing was performed on Illumina Hi-Seq 2000, Hi-Seq 2500, or
Mi-Seq instruments.
Sequence processing. We took precautions in analyzing the data to avoid false-
positive SNP calls. All raw reads were adapter- and quality-trimmed with Trim-
momatic v0.3368. The quality settings were “SLIDINGWINDOW:5:15 MIN-
LEN:40”. Paired-end (PE) data were additionally processed with SeqPrep (https://
github.com/jstjohn/SeqPrep) to merge overlapping pairs. This increases the accu-
racy of sequence in the overlapping area, avoids problems in estimating coverage
and creates longer reads, which facilitates InDel calling. Duplicate reads were
omitted from downstream analyses. This is especially important for libraries with
insufficient M. leprae DNA fragments, which is not uncommon for low BI samples
or samples that are difficult to process, like FFPE samples. In these cases, library
enrichment with array-capture, or very deep sequencing often produce a high
number of duplicate reads (DNA fragments that were sequenced multiple times,
seemingly increasing the overall genome coverage), with each read having dozens
or even hundreds of copies. Such reads will amplify possible artefacts and sequence
errors, resulting in false SNP calls.
Sequence analysis. Preprocessed reads were mapped onto the M. leprae TN
reference genome (GenBank AL450380.1) with Bowtie2 v2.2.569. We filtered out all
reads with mapping quality below 8 and omitted repetitive regions in the reference
sequence. We also omitted ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes because alignments in
these regions tend to be error prone. This is because rRNA genes are highly
conserved in bacteria, so sequences from other species could map to the M. leprae
reference sequence. This usually happens when the content of M. leprae DNA in a
sequencing library is scarce and is even more pronounced when libraries with low
M. leprae content undergo array-capture. However, because lineage-specific
mutations were previously observed in the M. leprae rrs gene30, we manually
checked the alignments corresponding to the rRNA genes and added the curated
results to Supplementary Data 2.

 SNP calling was done using VarScan v2.3.970. To avoid false-positive SNP calls
the following cutoffs were applied: minimum overall coverage of five non-
duplicated reads, minimum of three non-duplicated reads supporting the SNP,
mapping quality score >8, base quality score >15, and a SNP frequency above 80%.
InDel calling was done using Platypus v0.8.171 followed by manual curation.
Completed genome sequences of M. leprae Br4923 and Mycobacterium
lepromatosis (GenBank JRPY00000000.1) were aligned against the M. leprae TN
reference using LAST72 using the default parameters for the former and the
gamma-centroid option for the latter.
Mixed samples. A large number of missing values, especially in lineage-specific
loci, points to the presence of more than one strain in a sequencing library.
Although not thoroughly tested, in our opinion mixed data sets are mostly due to
technical problems or contamination because in some cases we were able to
identify the problematic strains. The possible presence of multiple M. leprae strains
in single skin lesions was not tested in this study, but we expect it to be extremely
low. Overall, a few mixed data sets were detected and some were removed from this
study, except for samples that we deemed important and describe below. Never-
theless, results were not biased because loci with mixed alleles were treated as
missing values.
Zensho-4 seems to contain a fraction of another strain (possibly around 40%)
that is closely related to it. Only a few loci had mixed alleles, and these include the
A91V substitution in gyrA (supported by 62% of reads) and the D464N
substitution in gyrB (supported by 41% of reads). The latter was attributed to
Zensho-4 for simplicity. Similarly, Zensho-5 seems to contain around 30% of
Zensho-4. This is the main reason why we could not detect SNPs specific only to
Zensho-5 (Fig. 3a), since such SNPs would be “diluted” with wild-type alleles from
Zensho-4 and could not pass the SNP “purity” threshold. We included these two
samples in this study because they are multi-drug-resistant and belong to the SNP-
type 3K-0. Furthermore, mutations in genes conferring drug resistance from this
study match with those from earlier reports of these samples, confirming their
identity73.
Thai-311 contains <20% of an unidentified 3K-0 strain that belongs to the
Kyoto-1/Zensho-5 cluster of strains (Fig. 3a). SNP calling was not significantly
affected. Finally, sample Ye2-3 contained around 25% of an unidentified strain
belonging to SNP-type 4. Because we only have few samples from Yemen, we
decided to keep Ye2-3 in this study.
Phylogeny and dating analysis. Concatenated SNP alignments were used for the
analyses. MP trees were constructed in MEGA674 using 500 bootstrap replicates.
Sites with missing data were partially deleted (80% coverage cutoff), resulting in
3046 variable sites used for the tree calculation. The Subtree-Pruning-Regrafting
algorithm was used as the MP search method. Dating analysis and discrete phy-
logeography were done using BEAST2 v2.4.440. Details are given in the Supple-
mentary Note.
Data availability. Sequence data are available from the NCBI Sequence Read
Archive (SRA) under accession number SRP072827. Accession numbers for all
samples used in this study are given in the Supplementary Data 1. Other relevant
data supporting the findings of the study are available in this published article and
