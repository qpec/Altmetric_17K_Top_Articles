Background: There is growing concern about the use of opioids prior to total knee arthroplasty (TKA), and research has
suggested that preoperative opioid use may lead to worse pain outcomes following surgery. We evaluated the pain relief
achieved by TKA in patients who had and those who had not used opioids use before the procedure.
Methods: We augmented data from a prospective cohort study of TKA outcomes with opioid-use data abstracted from
medical records. We collected patient-reported outcomes and demographic data before and 6 months after TKA. We used
the Pain Catastrophizing Scale and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) to
quantify the pain experiences of patients treated with TKA who had had a baseline score of ‡20 on the WOMAC pain scale
(a 0 to 100-point scale, with 100 being the worst score), who provided follow-up data, and who had not had another
surgical procedure within the 2 years prior to TKA. We built a propensity score for preoperative opioid use based on the
Pain Catastrophizing Scale score, comorbidities, and baseline pain. We used a general linear model, adjusting for the
propensity score and baseline pain, to compare the change in the WOMAC pain score 6 months after TKA between
persons who had and those who had not used opioids before TKA.
Results: The cohort included 156 patients with a mean age of 65.7 years (standard deviation [SD] = 8.2 years) and a
mean body mass index (BMI) of 31.1 kg/m2 (SD = 6.1 kg/m2); 62.2% were female. Preoperatively, 36 patients (23%) had
had at least 1 opioid prescription. The mean baseline WOMAC pain score was 43.0 points (SD = 12.8) for the group that
had not used opioids before TKA and 46.9 points (SD = 15.7) for those who had used opioids (p = 0.12). The mean
preoperative Pain Catastrophizing Scale score was greater among opioid users (15.5 compared with 10.7 points among
non-users, p = 0.006). Adjusted analyses showed that the opioid group had a mean 6-month reduction in the WOMAC pain
score of 27.0 points (95% confidence interval [CI] = 22.7 to 31.3) compared with 33.6 points (95% CI = 31.4 to 35.9)
in the non-opioid group (p = 0.008).
Conclusions: Patients who used opioids prior to TKA obtained less pain relief from the operation. Clinicians should
consider limiting pre-TKA opioid prescriptions to optimize the benefits of TKA.

nee osteoarthritis is associated with substantial activity
limitation and chronic pain. While total knee arthro-
plasty (TKA) is an effective treatment to relieve pain
and restore function, patients spend an average of 13 years
undergoing nonoperative therapies such as nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, and intra-articular in-
jections before ultimately undergoing TKA; this highlights the
need for effective analgesics
1. Although treatment guidelines
regarding the role of opioids for management of pain caused
by knee osteoarthritis prior to TKA have been inconsistent

 in the U.S. over $1.5 billion is spent annually on prescription
opioids for people with knee osteoarthritis
5. Furthermore,
opioid utilization has increased drastically, with nearly 40%
of Medicare beneficiaries with knee osteoarthritis receiving at
least 1 opioid prescription in 20096.
Increased utilization of opioids has been accompanied by
concerns about their adverse effects on surgical outcomes
when they are taken prior to total joint arthroplasty (TJA). High
doses of opioids have been associated with the development of
opioid dependence and hyperalgesia, which could contribute to
intractable pain following TJA
7. Prior studies have shown that
patients who use opioids preoperatively are more likely to con-
tinue to use them after TJA
7-10. The growing concern over opioid
use has led to multiple studies comparing clinical outcomes
between patients treated with opioids and those treated without
opioids prior to TJA. Studies have shown an association between
preoperative opioid use and increased pain as well as worse
functional outcomes within the first week following TJA
8,9,11.
Preoperative opioid use has also been associated with impaired
long-term clinical outcomes of various types of orthopaedic
surgery, particularly spinal procedures
12-15.
Although recent studies have suggested that patients who
use preoperative opioids have worse outcomes of TKA
9,16,17,
they were based on limited sample sizes and the authors did
not consider pain catastrophizing or use appropriate analytic
methods to address confounding by indications that could
contribute to poorer pain and functional outcomes. To address
these gaps, we used restricted propensity score methodology to
adjust for confounding by indication in our study comparing
the reduction of pain after TKA between patients who had used
opioids preoperative and those without prior opioid treatment.
Materials and Methods
Sample
T
his study was conducted at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a tertiary-care
academic medical center in Boston, Massachusetts. We used data from the
Adding Value in Knee Arthroplasty (AViKA) Postoperative Care Navigation
Trial, a randomized controlled trial evaluating motivational interviewing to
enhance TKA outcomes
18,19. The study included patients who had undergone
primary unilateral TKA for osteoarthritis when they were at least 40 years old.
Each subject had completed, within 6 weeks before and again 6 months after
TKA, a questionnaire consisting of validated measures to assess clinical out-
comes, including the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoar-
thritis Index (WOMAC)20, 5-question Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5), Pain
Catastrophizing Scale, and questions about comorbidities. The Pain Cata-
strophizing Scale quantifies the degree to which an individual has exaggerated
negative thoughts as a response to pain on a scale of 0 to 52, with higher scores
indicating worse catastrophizing
21.
Medical Record Review
To obtain detailed information on opioid use, we reviewed the electronic
medical record of each enrolled AViKA Trial subject to determine opioid
utilization from 2 years before to 1 year after TKA. Multiple sources of data
were reviewed for each patient, including clinical visit notes, anesthesiology
reports, discharge notes, prescription history, and medication list. We re-
corded information for 6 opioids: oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone,
morphine, tramadol, and codeine. Other opioids were rarely found and were
recorded as “other.” For each mention of an opioid prescription in the medical
record, we abstracted whether the opioid was prescribed before TKA, after
TKA, or both. We further documented any additional surgical procedures
in the period from 2 years prior to TKA to 1 year after TKA and the type of
medical insurance.
Literature Review
We conducted a systematic literature search to identify published studies on the
effects of preoperative opioids on postoperative orthopaedic outcomes for
comparison with our study. Our primary source for identifying publications
was PubMed, which we searched with the following queries: orthopaedic
outcomes and opioids, surgical outcomes and opioids, and arthroplasty and
opioids. Additionally, we searched through the references of the identified
papers to identify any publications missed by the queries. We then read the titles
and abstracts of the 1,700 results to include papers relevant to orthopaedics and
preoperative opioid use. We chose 26 studies and then excluded those in which
validated outcome measure questionnaires had not been used. This left 5 publi-
cations with which to compare our own study. The questionnaires used in these
studies were the Knee Society objective score16, Harris hip score10, WOMAC17,
American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score
15, and Oswestry Disability
Index (ODI)
22. All preoperative and postoperative scores were transformed into
a 0 to 100-point scale with 100 being the worst. We calculated a relative re-
duction in pain benefits due to opioids as the relative difference between the
opioid users and non-users in the change in pain from before TKAto after TKA.
Statistical Analysis
We compared demographic and clinical characteristics between subjects with
and those without pre-TKA opioid use. We used the chi-square test to compare

 across categorical factors (sex, type of insurance, and education level), the t test
to compare across continuous variables with normal distribution (age, baseline
WOMAC pain score, and baseline WOMAC function score), and the Wilcoxon
rank sum test to compare across continuous variables with skewed distribution
(body mass index [BMI], number of comorbidities, and baseline Pain Cata-
strophizing Scale score).
To adjust for potential confounding by the indication for opioid use, we
built a propensity score for opioid use, using logistic regression with pre-TKA
opioid use as an outcome. The independent variables were the Pain Cata-
strophizing Scale score, Charlson Comorbidity Index (grouped as 0, 1 to 3, and
>3), and baseline WOMAC pain score. The model had a c-statistic of 0.682. We
identified a common use area as a set of propensity scores that were common
between subjects who did and those who did not use opioids prior to TKA (0.12
to 0.50) and excluded subjects with propensity scores greater or less than this
common range from our analytical sample.
We then built a general linear model with the change in the WOMAC
pain score over the 6 months following the TKA as the outcome variable and
with the propensity for opioid use described above, use of opioids before TKA,
and baseline WOMAC pain score as the independent variables.
We conducted a sensitivity analysis using marginal structural models,
with inverse probability weighting according to the likelihood of opioid use
prior to TKA. All analyses were conducted with SAS 9.4 software, and p < 0.05
indicated significant results.
Results
Sample Characteristics
F
rom August 2011 to November 2013, 308 patients were
enrolled in the AViKA study and 252 of them had a pre-
TKAWOMAC pain score of ‡20. Of those subjects, 221 (88%)
provided 6-month data. We excluded 44 subjects because they
had had surgery within 2 years prior to TKA, to minimize
misattribution of opioid use to another surgical procedure. Of
the remaining 177 subjects, 156 were included in the analysis
based on the common use area of the propensity score values
(0.12 to 0.50) (Fig. 1).
The mean age at the time of TKA was 65.7 years (standard
deviation [SD] = 8.2 years), 62.2% of the patients were female,
and the mean BMI was 31.1 kg/m2 (SD = 6.1 kg/m2). The
majority (60.4%) of the patients had graduated from college,
53% of the cohort had at least 1 comorbid condition, and 32.7%
had ‡2 comorbidities. The baseline Pain Catastrophizing Scale
score was 11.8 (SD = 8.6) (Table I).
Opioid Utilization
Thirty-six (23%) of the 156 patients in the cohort had had at
least 1 opioid prescription within the 2 years prior to TKA. The

 most common opioids used preoperatively in this sample were
oxycodone, hydrocodone, and tramadol. Fourteen (9.0%) of
the patients used >1 type of opioid. The proportions of subjects
using each preoperative opioid identified within the medical
records are shown in Table II.
Postoperatively, 150 (96.2%) of the patients had at least
1 opioid prescription listed in their medical record, with 146
(93.6%) having prescriptions for multiple opioids. Oxycodone
was the most frequently prescribed opioid (150; 96.2%), fol-
lowed by hydrocodone (52; 33.3%) (Table II).
Demographic characteristics (age, sex, and education
level) were similar between patients with a documented history
of pre-TKA opioid utilization and those who had not used
opioids preoperatively. The unadjusted mean baseline WOMAC
pain score was worse for those who had used opioids before TKA
(46.9 points compared with 43.0 points for those who had not),
but the difference was not significant (p = 0.12), and those who
had used opioids before TKA had significantly worse functional
limitations (49.0 compared with 42.1 points, p = 0.009) (Table I).
Multivariate analysis showed that, after adjusting for
baseline WOMAC pain and comorbidity scores, pain cata-
strophizing was the only factor independently associated with
pre-TKA opioid use. Those who had used opioids before TKA
had mean a Pain Catastrophizing Scale score of 15.5 points
compared with 10.7 points for those who had not (p = 0.006).
Every unit increase in the Pain Catastrophizing Scale score was
associated with a 4.7% increase in the adjusted odds of using
opioids prior to TKA. After we adjusted for the propensity
score, the baseline WOMAC score became more balanced be-
tween those who had used and those who had not used opioids
before TKA (Table III).
Relationship Between Pre-TKA Opioid Use and Outcomes
After adjustment for the propensity score and baseline WOMAC
pain score, patients who had not used opioids before TKA had a
mean 6-month WOMAC pain score of 10.5 points (95% con-
fidence interval [CI] = 8.3 to 12.8) compared with 17.1 points
(95% CI = 12.8 to 21.4) for those who had used opioids prior to
TKA (Table III). Multivariate analyses adjusted for the propen-
sity score and baseline pain score showed that the opioid group
had a mean 6-month WOMAC pain-score reduction of 27.0
points (95% CI = 22.7 to 31.3) compared with 33.6 points (95%
CI = 31.4 to 35.9) for the non-opioid-use group; the difference
between the groups was 6.6 points (p = 0.008) (Table III).
Sensitivity analyses using an inverse probability of opioid
use weighting method showed similar results, with the reduc-
tion in the WOMAC pain score being 5.7 points less for the
opioid users than for those who had not used opioids prior to
TKA (p = 0.0430). Adding pre-TKA functional limitations to
the model did not qualitatively change the results.

16. Pivec et al. reported that, at 58 months after
total hip arthroplasty (THA), opioid users had a 7.7% reduc-
tion in pain relief, as shown by Harris hip scores (p = 0.002),
compared with non-users10. Nguyen et al. reported that pre-
operative opioid use resulted in a significant (p < 0.01) re-
duction of 21.4% in pain relief at 6 to 12 months following
TKA or THA
17. In a study with a 2 to 9-year follow-up, Morris
et al. reported a significant, 14.5% reduction in pain relief,
according to the ASES score, for those who had used opioids
prior to reverse shoulder arthroplasty (p = 0.005)
15. Notably,
Radcliff et al. did not report a significant difference in the ODI
at 4 years after lumbar discectomy between those who had and
those who had not used opioids prior to surgery
22 (Table IV).
Discussion
T
he use of opioids for chronic non-cancer-related pain has
increased drastically within the past decade
23. This trend
has been observed for knee osteoarthritis, with nearly half of
Medicare beneficiaries with this condition receiving at least
1 opioid prescription in 2009
6. As the majority of eligible patients
with knee osteoarthritis eventually undergo TKA
1, understand-
ing the postoperative effect of pre-TKA opioid use is imperative
to the creation of appropriate treatment guidelines. Using data
collected from medical records, we found that patients who had
used opioids prior to TKA experienced less pain relief 6 months
postoperatively than patients who had not used opioids prior
to TKA.
The results that we present support and expand on pre-
viously published findings regarding the influence of pre-TKA
opioid use (Table IV). Zywiel and colleagues reported that pa-
tients using opioids prior to TKA had significantly higher rates of
revision for residual pain or stiffness (8 of 49 knees) than those
who had not used opioids (0 revisions)
16. Furthermore, their
opioid-treated patients had significantly lower Knee Society
scores at the time of final follow-up, suggesting worse clinical
outcomes, than their non-opioid-using counterparts. Pivec et al.
reported similar results regarding the effect of preoperative opi-
oid use on the clinical outcomes of THA, with their patients who
used narcotics prior to surgery having worse Harris hip scores
than those with no history of opioid use
10. Nguyen et al. included
an intervention group in their study on the effects of preoperative
opioid use on TJA outcomes. They showed that, while the opioid-
dependent group had significantly worse follow-up WOMAC
scores than patients with no preoperative opioid use, those who
reduced their opioid consumption by at least 50% prior to sur-
gery did not have different outcomes compared with those
without a history of opioid use17. The analyses in these papers,
however, were often limited by small sample sizes, lack of ad-
justment for additional comorbidities, and a lack of randomi-
zation into the treatment groups.
Our current study, which showed results consistent with
those in the prior literature and expanded the evidence that
pre-TKA opioid use is associated with less pain relief following
the surgery, had several methodologic benefits. We adjusted for
baseline WOMAC pain scores and comorbidities as well as for
the propensity score for using opioids before TKA to provide
a more comprehensive adjustment for potential confounding
by indications and to isolate the independent effect of pre-TKA
opioid use on pain relief. Overall, the 6-month change in the
WOMAC pain score was associated with the baseline pain score
and opioid use. Preoperatively, there was a small but not sig-
nificant difference in the WOMAC pain scores between the
groups, whereas the pain scores at 6 months were significantly
worse for those who had used opioids preoperatively (p = 0.008).
This difference indicates that preoperative opioid use may have
affected the pain reduction achieved with the TKA.
Our data showed that pre-TKA opioid use was associated
with pain catastrophizing but not with baseline pain. Fur-
thermore, pre-TKA opioid use, but not pain catastrophizing,
was independently associated with worse post-TKA pain. Our
study suggests that pain catastrophizing may play an important
role in decisions by physicians and patients to use opioids,
which then places them at risk for poorer outcomes.
Of the drugs that we considered to be opioids, tramadol was
the most frequently used prior to TKA. Tramadol is a centrally
acting analgesic unique for its multiple mechanisms of pain relief,
given its behavior as an opiate agonist and as a reuptake inhibitorof
both norepinephrine and serotonin. We chose to classify tramadol
as an opioid because it is structurally analogous to other opioids.
There are important limitations to our analyses. As
evidence of opioid utilization was obtained from the medical
record and patients were not interviewed for verification, we
are unable to definitively state that opioid prescription resulted in
utilization of the entire prescribed dosage. It is possible that pa-
tients received a prescription and failed to obtain the analgesic or
took less than the dispensed amount. This could lead to an un-
derestimation or overestimation of the effects of opioids on pain
relief provided by TKA. Conversely, as preoperative opioid pre-
scriptions were identified from a single medical record, it is pos-
sible that patients received additional opioid prescriptions from
outside sources. Additionally, without verification interviews we
were unable to fully characterize postoperative opioid use, which
could have affected pain reporting during follow-up visits. Our
cohort consisted of patients enrolled in the AViKA study, a ran-
domized controlled trial of care navigation following TKA, which
could have contributed to selection bias. We followed patients for
only 6 months following TKA. It is possible that those who used
opioids before TKA could have eventually, over a longer period of
time, obtained the same degree of pain relief obtained by the
patients who had not used opioids preoperatively. Since we did
not have an objective way to assess individual pain tolerance
in general, we could not rule out the possibility that differences
in the reported severity of the painwere affected by differences in
pain tolerance. We also did not have data on pain in other joints
or the spine prior to TKA, which may have had an impact on
post-TKA pain. Finally, patients were enrolled from a single,
tertiary, academic medical center, potentially limiting the gen-
eralizability of our results.
In conclusion, the data that we presented support prior
reports of worse TKA clinical outcomes in persons who used
opioids preoperatively
16. Specifically, our data showed that

 preoperative opioid use may contribute to decreased pain relief
in the early postoperative period.
As individuals with osteoarthritis spend an average of
13 years between trials of nonoperative therapies and elective
TKA1, our results should be viewed as a warning that opioid
use may be problematic during this period due to their neg-
ative effects on subsequent TKA outcomes. Furthermore,
considering that the U.S. spends over $1.5 billion
5 annually on
prescription opioids for patients with knee osteoarthritis, and
nearly $30 billion
24 on illicit use, reducing use of opioids may
decrease their deleterious effects. Clinicians and policy makers
may consider limiting the use of opioids prior to TKA to optimize
post-TKA pain relief. n
