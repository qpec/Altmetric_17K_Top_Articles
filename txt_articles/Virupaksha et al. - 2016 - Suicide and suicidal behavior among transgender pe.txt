The prevalence of suicide attempts among respondents 
to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey 
(NTDS), conducted by the National Gay and Lesbian 
Task Force and National Center for Transgender Equality, 
is 41 percent, which vastly exceeds the 4.6 percent of 
the overall U.S. population who report a lifetime suicide 
attempt, and is also higher than the 10-20 percent 
of lesbian, gay and bisexual adults who report ever 
attempting suicide.  Much remains to be learned about 
underlying factors and which groups within the diverse 
population of transgender and gender non-conforming 
people are most at risk.
In the present study, we sought to increase 
understanding of suicidal behavior among transgender 
and gender non-conforming people through an in-depth 
analysis of NTDS data.  The specific aims of our analysis 
were to identify the key characteristics and experiences 
associated with lifetime suicide attempts in the NTDS 
sample as a whole, and to examine how lifetime suicide 
attempts vary among different groups of transgender 
and gender non-conforming people. 
Key findings of this report include the following:
• Suicide attempts among trans men 
(46%) and trans women (42%) were 
slightly higher than the full sample (41%). 
Cross-dressers assigned male at birth 
have the lowest reported prevalence of 
suicide attempts among gender identity 
groups (21%).
• Analysis of other demographic variables 
found prevalence of suicide attempts 
was highest among those who are younger (18 to 
24: 45%), multiracial (54%) and American Indian or 
Alaska Native (56%), have lower levels of educational 
attainment (high school or less: 48-49%), and have 
lower annual household income (less than $10,000: 
54%).
• Prevalence of suicide attempts is elevated among 
those who disclose to everyone that they are 
transgender or gender-non-conforming (50%) and 
among those that report others can tell always (42%) 
or most of the time (45%) that they are transgender 
or gender non-conforming even if they don’t tell them.
• Respondents who are HIV-positive (51%) and 
respondents with disabilities (55-65%) also have 
elevated prevalence of suicide attempts.  In particular, 
65 percent of those with a mental health condition 
that substantially affects a major life activity reported 
attempting suicide.
• Respondents who experienced rejection by family and 
friends, discrimination, victimization, or violence had 
elevated prevalence of suicide attempts, such as those 
who experienced the following:
— Family chose not to speak/spend time with them: 57%
— Discrimination, victimization, or violence at school, 
at work, and when accessing health care
• Harassed or bullied at school (any level): 50-54%
• Experienced discrimination or harassment at 
work: 50-59%
• Doctor or health care provider refused to treat 
them: 60%
• Suffered physical or sexual violence:
— At work: 64-65%
— At school (any level): 63-78%
— Discrimination, victimization, or violence by law 
enforcement
• Disrespected or harassed by law enforcement 
officers: 57-61% 
• Suffered physical or sexual violence: By law 
enforcement officers: 60-70
— Experienced homelessness: 69%
Overall, the most striking finding of our analysis was 
the exceptionally high prevalence of lifetime suicide 
attempts reported by NTDS respondents across 
all demographics and experiences.  Based on prior 
research and the findings of this report, we find that 
mental health factors and experiences of harassment, 
discrimination, violence and rejection may interact to 
produce a marked vulnerability to suicidal behavior in 
transgender and gender non-conforming individuals.  
More research on suicidal behavior among transgender 
and gender non-conforming people is needed.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
“Overall, the most striking finding of our analysis was the 
exceptionally high prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts reported 
by NTDS respondents across all demographics and experiences.”

Since 2001, over a dozen separate surveys of 
transgender adults in the United States and other 
countries have found lifetime suicide attempts to be 
reported by 25-43 percent of respondents (Clements-
Nolle et al., 2001; Clements-Nolle et al., 2006; Grant 
et al., 2011; Kenagy, 2005; Maguen & Shipherd, 2010; 
Transgender Equality Network Ireland, 2012; Trans PULSE, 
2010; Whittle et al., 2007; Whittle et al., 2008; Xavier et al., 
2005; Xavier et al., 2007).  These figures vastly exceed 
the 4.6 percent of the overall U.S. population who report 
a lifetime suicide attempt (Kessler, Borges and Walters, 
1999; Nock & Kessler, 2006), and are also higher than 
the 10-20 percent of lesbian, gay and bisexual adults who 
report ever attempting suicide (Paul et al., 2002). 
While these surveys suggest an unparalleled level of 
suicidal behavior among transgender adults, much 
remains to be learned about underlying factors and which 
groups within this diverse population are most at risk. In 
the present study, we sought to increase understanding 
of suicidal behavior among transgender and gender non-
conforming people through an in-depth analysis of data 
from the U.S. National Transgender Discrimination Survey 
(NTDS), conducted by the National Gay and Lesbian Task 
Force and the National Center for Transgender Equality. 
With over 6,000 respondents, the NTDS is the largest 
survey of transgender and gender non-conforming 
adults to date. In that sample, 41 percent of respondents 
reported ever attempting suicide (Grant et al., 2011). 
The specific aims of our analysis were to identify the key 
characteristics and experiences associated with lifetime 
suicide attempts in the NTDS sample as a whole, and 
to examine how lifetime suicide attempts vary among 
different groups of transgender and gender non-
conforming people. In this report, we present our findings, 
discuss their implications, and conclude by describing 
considerations and needs for future research.
INTRODUCTION
The NTDS was launched in fall 2008 and was distributed 
online and on paper through over 900 organizations that 
were known venues for contact with the transgender 
community throughout the United States. Details of 
the survey instrument, methods and procedures have 
previously been described (Grant et al., 2011). In brief, 
responses were obtained from 6,456 self-identified 
transgender and gender non-conforming adults aged 18 
and over. History of lifetime suicide attempt was among 
the many outcomes covered in the 70-item survey. 
The analysis of the NTDS data presented in this paper 
is mainly descriptive.  Where appropriate, Pearson’s 
chi-square tests of independence were conducted to 
assess whether lifetime suicide attempts were related 
to a variety of characteristics and experiences of survey 
respondents.
While the NTDS provides a wealth of information 
about the experiences of transgender and gender 
non-conforming people, the survey instrument and 
methodology posed some limitations for this study. 
First, the NTDS questionnaire included only a single 
item about suicidal behavior that asked, “Have you ever 
attempted suicide?” with dichotomized responses of 
Yes/No. Researchers have found that using this question 
alone in surveys can inflate the percentage of affirmative 
responses, since some respondents may use it to 
communicate self-harm behavior that is not a “suicide 
attempt,” such as seriously considering suicide, planning 
for suicide, or engaging in self-harm behavior without 
the intent to die (Bongiovi-Garcia et al., 2009).  The 
National Comorbity Survey, a nationally representative 
survey, found that probing for intent to die through 
in-person interviews reduced the prevalence of lifetime 
suicide attempts from 4.6 percent to 2.7 percent of the 
adult sample (Kessler et al., 1999; Nock & Kessler, 2006).  
Without such probes, we were unable to determine the 
extent to which the 41 percent of NTDS participants 
who reported ever attempting suicide may overestimate 
the actual prevalence of attempts in the sample. In 
addition, the analysis was limited due to a lack of 
follow-up questions asked of respondents who reported 
having attempted suicide about such things as age and 
transgender/gender non-conforming status at the time 
of the attempt.
Second, the survey did not directly explore mental 
health status and history, which have been identified 
as important risk factors for both attempted and 
completed suicide in the general population (Lasage, 
Boyer, Grunberg, Vanier, Morissett et al., 1994; Suominen, 
Henrikssen, Suokas, Isometsa, Ostamo, et al., 1996; 
Harris & Barraclough, 1997; Bertolote & Fleischmann, 
2002; Nock, Hwang, Sampson, & Kessler, 2010). Further, 
research has shown that the impact of adverse life 
events, such as being attacked or raped, is most severe 
among people with co-existing mood, anxiety and other 
mental disorders (Breslau, Davis, Andreski, & Peterson, 
METHODS AND LIMITATIONS

Methods - continued
1991; Kendler, Kardowski, & Presco, 1999). The lack of 
systematic mental health information in the NTDS data 
significantly limited our ability to identify the pathways 
to suicidal behavior among the respondents.
Third, since the NTDS utilized convenience sampling, it 
is unclear how representative the respondents are of the 
overall U.S. transgender/gender non-conforming adult 
population.  Further, the survey’s focus on discrimination 
may have resulted in wider participation by persons 
who had suffered negative life experiences due to anti-
transgender bias.1  As the relationship between minority 
stress and mental health would suggest (Meyer, 2003), 
this may have contributed to a higher prevalence of 
negative outcomes, including lifetime suicide attempts, 
in the sample. These limitations should be kept in mind 
in interpreting the findings of our analyses. 
Finally, it should be emphasized that the NTDS, 
like all similar surveys, captured information about 
suicide attempts, not completed suicide. Lacking 
any information about completed suicide among 
transgender people (due primarily to decedents not 
being identified by gender identity or transgender 
status), it may be tempting to consider suicide attempt 
data to be the best available proxy measure of suicide 
death. Data from the U.S. population at large, however, 
show clear demographic differences between suicide 
attempters and those who die by suicide.  While almost 
80 percent of all suicide deaths occur among males, 
about 75 percent of suicide attempts are made by 
females. Adolescents, who overall have a relatively low 
suicide rate of about 7 per 100,000 people, account for 
a substantial proportion of suicide attempts, making 
perhaps 100 or more attempts for every suicide death.  
By contrast, the elderly have a much higher suicide rate 
of about 15 per 100,000, but make only four attempts 
for every completed suicide. Although making a suicide 
attempt generally increases the risk of subsequent 
suicidal behavior, six separate studies that have followed 
suicide attempters for periods of five to 37 years 
found death by suicide to occur in 7 to 13 percent of 
the samples (Tidemalm et al., 2008). We do not know 
whether these general population patterns hold true for 
transgender people but in the absence of supporting 
data, we should be especially careful not to extrapolate 
findings about suicide attempts among transgender 
adults to imply conclusions about completed suicide in 
this population.
1. For the purposes of this paper, “anti-transgender bias” means bias or prejudice that is directed toward people who are transgender or gender non-conforming.

2 Multiracial or Mixed Race includes survey respondents who selected “Multiracial or Mixed Race” as their race/ethnicity on the survey plus those who selected two or more races/ethnicities.
3 NTDS researchers utilized the survey question on employment status to create this three-level current workforce participation recode for survey respondents.  The original variable contained 
the following twelve categories: full-time, part-time, more than one job, self-employed (own your business), self-employed (contract worker), unemployed but looking, unemployed and 
stopped looking, on disability, student, retired, homemaker or full-time parent, and other.  The recoded variable collapsed the twelve categories into three: in workforce, out of the workforce 
– unemployed, and out of the workforce – not looking.  PLEASE NOTE: the rate of those who are out of the workforce and unemployed should not be used as the unemployment rate for the 
NTDS sample.  Unemployment rates calculated by the U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics do not include those who are out of the workforce and not looking for employment.  For more information 
on how the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics measures unemployment, please visit http:/
/www.bls.gov/cps/cps_htgm.htm.  The unemployment rate for the NTDS sample is 14%.

Demographics - continued
As shown in Table 3, reported lifetime suicide attempts 
decreased with age, from a high of 45 percent for 
18-44 year-olds to 33 percent for 55-64 year-olds and 
16 percent for those over 65 years.7   Respondents 
who indicated “white” race/ethnicity had the lowest 
prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts at 38 percent, 
while American Indians and Alaska Natives reported 
the highest at 56 percent. Generally, those with 
greater educational achievement were less likely to 
report having attempted suicide, with 31 percent of 
respondents with a graduate degree, compared to 49 
percent of those with a high school diploma, reporting 
a lifetime suicide attempt. Like education, those with 
higher household income had a lower prevalence of 
lifetime suicide attempts, with 26 percent of those 
with income exceeding $100,000 saying they had ever 
attempted suicide, compared to 54 percent of those 
with income less than $10,000. 
SUICIDE ATTEMPTS AND 
DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS
4 Gender identities listed here are as they appeared on the NTDS survey.  “Part time one gender/part time another” was listed to include those respondents who are not yet living full-time in 
their gender identity, such as those who only express their gender identity in certain circumstances (e.g. at home but not at work) and/or those who do not wish to live full-time in a gender 
different than the one assigned at birth (e.g. part time cross-dressers).
5 NTDS researchers utilized the three questions in the survey related to gender identity and sex assigned at birth (shown in Table 2) to create this six-level gender identity recode for survey 
respondents.  Respondents were first categorized by cross-tabulating sex assigned at birth and primary gender today. Next, respondents’ answers to strength of identification with listed terms 
were taken into consideration.  For instance, those who were assigned male at birth and today identify as female would generally be categorized as trans women/ MTF.  However, if they did 
not at all identify with terms indicating a trans identity (transgender, transsexual, MTF) and strongly identified with another identity, such as cross-dresser, they were categorized according to 
the identity with which they strongly identified.  For more information on how the gender identity recode was constructed, see Injustice at Every Turn, available at http:/
/www.thetaskforce.org/
reports_and_research/ntds.
6 “GNC” stands for Gender Non-Conforming.
7 Lower percentages of older respondents reporting lifetime suicide attempts has also been observed in some general population surveys, including the National Comorbidity Survey (Nock & 
Kessler, 2006). Possible reasons include older respondents’ selective recall, reinterpretation of past suicidal behavior in light of more recent life events, and cohort effects.

Lifetime suicide attempts were less frequently reported 
by respondents who were in the workforce (37%) than 
those who were out of the workforce and not looking 
for work (46%) and those who were unemployed (50%).  
Among all categories of current participation in the 
workforce, respondents who were retired reported the 
lowest prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts (29%), 
which is consistent with findings related to age.  The 
highest prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts (65%) 
was found among those on disability.8
In regard to relationship status, those who were married 
or widowed reported lower prevalence of lifetime suicide 
attempts at 33 percent and 31 percent, respectively, while 
those who were single reported the highest prevalence 
at 45 percent. The prevalence of lifetime suicide 
attempts varied across sexual orientation categories 
with 35 percent of those who described themselves as 
heterosexual saying they had ever attempted suicide, 
compared to 40 percent of those who were gay/lesbian, 
40 percent of those who were bisexual, and 46 percent of 
those who said they were asexual or another orientation.
8 The workforce participation question in the NTDS was a “check all” item with twelve workforce categories listed, meaning respondents could choose more than one response from the list of 
twelve.  Therefore, a chi-square test was only performed with the workforce recode variable, as shown in Table 3.  Findings for those on disability and those who are retired are provided here 
due to their notable rates of lifetime suicide attempts.
 8
As shown in Table 4, among respondents who were 
assigned female at birth, 44 percent reported making 
a lifetime suicide attempt, compared to 38 percent of 
those who were assigned male at birth.  
The percentage of respondents who reported a lifetime 
suicide attempt overall showed little variability by current 
gender identity, as defined by respondents’ answers 
to the question “What is your primary gender identity 
today?” The one exception was seen among those who 
described themselves as “part time as one gender/part 
time as another.”  These respondents, who constituted 
20 percent of the NTDS sample, were less likely 
than others to report having ever attempted suicide. 
Using the gender identity recode which categorized 
respondents into one of six gender identities, trans 
women (MTF), trans men (FTM), and female-assigned 
cross-dressers had the highest prevalence of lifetime 
suicide attempts (42%, 46% and 44% respectively).  
Additional insight into the relationship between gender 
identity and lifetime suicide attempts was provided by 
respondents’ answers to a survey question that inquired 
about mental health care services and medical treatments 
and procedures related to gender transition. As shown in 
T
able 5, respondents who said they had received transition-
related health care or wanted to have it someday were 
more likely to report having attempted suicide than those 
who said they did not want it. This pattern was observed 
across all transition-related services and procedures 
that were explored in the NTDS. The survey did not 
provide information about the timing of reported suicide 
attempts in relation to receiving transition-related health 
care, which precluded investigation of transition-related 
explanations for these patterns.
Perceived recognition by others as transgender/
gender non-conforming was also examined as possibly 
contributing to variation in lifetime suicide attempt rates 
among NTDS respondents. For this analysis, we looked 
at responses to the questionnaire item, “People can tell 
I’m transgender/gender non-conforming even if I don’t 
tell them.” This item measured respondents’ perceptions 
of how often others recognize the respondent as 
transgender or gender non-conforming.  As can be 
seen in Table 6, lifetime suicide attempts were found 
to be lowest (36%) among respondents who said 
people can “never” tell they are transgender or gender 
non-conforming.  Suicide attempts were reported 
by higher percentages of those who said people can 
“always” (42%) or “most of the time” (45%) tell they are 
transgender or gender non-conforming.
To better understand the impact of perceived 
recognition as transgender or gender non-conforming 
on suicidality, we looked separately at respondents in 
each of the six major gender identity categories (see 
Table 7).  In three of the gender identity categories:

Related to these analyses, we also examined 
respondents’ disclosure of transgender/gender non-
conforming status and whether or not they were “out” in 
various settings.  As shown in Table 8, the prevalence of 
lifetime suicide attempts was found to be highest (50%) 
among those who said they “tell everyone” about their 
transgender/gender non-conforming status and lowest 
(33%) among those who said they “never” tell people 
their status.
Similarly, suicide attempts were more frequently 
reported by respondents who were “out” to others 
as transgender or gender non-conforming in various 
settings (see Table 9).9

trans women (MTF), male-assigned cross-dressers, 
and gender non-conforming/genderqueer people 
assigned male at birth, lifetime suicide attempt rates 
were found to be lower among those who perceived 
others as only “occasionally” or “never” being able to 
tell they are transgender or gender non-conforming, 
compared to those who thought that others could 
“always,” “most of the time,” or “sometimes” tell. Trans 
men (FTM) were found to have the same prevalence of 
lifetime suicide attempts (46%) regardless of whether 
they thought others can tell they are transgender. 
However, for respondents in the last two gender identity 
categories – female-assigned cross-dressers and gender 
non-conforming/genderqueer people assigned female 
at birth – the prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts 
was found to be higher among those who said other 
people “occasionally” or “never” can tell they are 
transgender or gender non-conforming, compared 
to those who said that other people “always,” “most 
of the time,” or “sometimes” can tell.  Cross-dressers 
assigned female at birth who perceived that they were 
generally not recognized as transgender or gender 
non-conforming were found in this analysis to have the 
highest prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts (47%).  
In summary, the patterns in Table 7 are most striking 
among those who said that people can occasionally or 
never tell they are transgender/gender non-conforming 
in that those on the trans-feminine spectrum had lower 
prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts than those on the 
trans-masculine spectrum.

9 Respondents were classified as being “Out” if they answered “a few,” “some,” “most” or “all” to the question, “How many people know or believe you are transgender/gender non-conforming in 
each of the following settings?”  Respondents who answered “none” for each setting found in this question were classified as “Not out”.  Those who responded “Not Applicable” to any of the 
settings were excluded from the analysis. Respondents who are “Out” are more likely to report that people can tell they are transgender or gender non-conforming.

Among respondents who reported having a disability 
due to a mental health condition, the prevalence of 
lifetime suicide attempts was not substantially affected 
by whether they could be recognized by others as 
transgender/gender non-conforming (see Table 13).
Respondents who indicated having a disability (physical, 
learning, mental health) that substantially affects a major 
life activity reported a higher prevalence of lifetime 
suicide attempts than those without a disability (57% 
v.33%, = 320.8, p < .001). As seen in Table 11, the highest 
prevalence of suicide attempts (65%) was reported 
by those who described their disability as related to a 
mental health condition. It should be noted that this was 
the only item on the NTDS that specifically asked about 
mental health, and was answered only by respondents 
who indicated in the previous question that they had a 
disability that substantially affects a major life activity.
As shown in Table 12, among respondents who indicated 
having a mental health disability, at least 54 percent 
of respondents in each of the six main gender identity 
categories reported a lifetime suicide attempt.  In all 
gender identity categories, respondents who did not 
indicate having a mental health disability were found to 
have significantly lower prevalence of lifetime suicide 
attempts than those in the same category who had such 
a disability.10   Among those who did not indicate having 
a mental health disability, the prevalence of suicide 
attempts ranged from a high of 40 percent among trans 
men (FTM) and female-assigned cross-dressers, to a low 
of 17 percent among male-assigned cross-dressers.
The prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts was higher 
among respondents who indicated being HIV positive 
(see Table 10).

SUICIDE ATTEMPTS AND DISABILITIES
10 Respondents who did not indicate having a mental health disability included those who reported no disability of any kind and those who reported a disability related to conditions other than 
mental health.

In a series of analyses, we looked at the relationship 
between suicide attempts and a range of stressful 
life experiences that NTDS respondents described as 
occurring due to anti-transgender bias, which we refer 
to collectively as “stressors related to anti-transgender 
bias.” These included experiences of rejection, 
discrimination, victimization, and violence that occurred 
within a number of specific contexts, as described below.
Housing
Relative to the prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts 
reported by NTDS respondents as a whole (41%), those 
who reported experiencing housing discrimination 
or other housing-related problems because of anti-
transgender bias were found to have an elevated 
prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts (see Table 14). 
The highest suicide attempt prevalence (69%) was 
found among those who became homeless due to anti-
transgender bias. 
School
A higher than average prevalence of lifetime suicide 
attempts was consistently found among NTDS 
respondents who reported that they had been harassed, 
bullied, or assaulted in school by other students and/
or teachers due to anti-transgender bias (see Table 15). 
Among such respondents, suicide attempt prevalence 
varied little according to the level of school at which 
the victimization occurred.  Consistently, suicide 
attempts were most frequently reported by those who 
had experienced school-based violence in the form of 
physical or sexual assault.
Work
As shown in Table 16, an elevated prevalence of lifetime 
suicide attempts was consistently found among 
respondents who reported negative work experiences 
related to anti-transgender bias. Prevalence was found

In addition, respondents who indicated having engaged 
in sex work reported a high prevalence of lifetime suicide 
attempts.  A separate question on the NTDS identified 
694 respondents who had engaged in sex work for 
income. Among those in this group who answered the 
question on ever attempting suicide (n=674), 407 or 60 
percent reported a lifetime suicide attempt.
Family and Friends 
A lower than average prevalence of lifetime suicide 
attempts (33%) was found among respondents who 
said their family relationships had remained strong after 
coming out (see Table 17). In contrast, the prevalence of 
suicide attempts was elevated among respondents who 
reported experiencing rejection, disruption, or abuse 
by family members or close friends because of anti-
transgender bias. Again, lifetime suicide attempts were 
reported most frequently by those who were victims of 
violence by a family member, with 65 percent of such 
respondents indicating having attempted suicide. 
Medical Care
Respondents who reported having negative experiences 
related to obtaining medical care as a transgender 
or gender non-conforming person also reported an 
elevated prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts (see 
Table 18). Sixty percent of respondents who said 
they had been refused medical care because of anti-
transgender bias reported a lifetime suicide attempt.

Law Enforcement
Respondents who reported having negative experiences 
with law enforcement officers commonly reported 
having attempted suicide (see Table 19). An especially 
high prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts was found 
among those who had experienced police violence in the 
form of physical or sexual assault. 
Lifetime suicide attempts were less prevalent among 
respondents who said they had been generally treated 
with respect by law enforcement personnel.  As seen 
in Table 20, decreasing level of comfort in seeking help 
from the police was found to be significantly related to 
higher prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts.

Nature of the Relationship between 
Stressors and Suicide Attempts
The survey data did not allow us to determine a direct 
causal relationship between experiencing rejection, 
discrimination, victimization, or violence, and lifetime 
suicide attempts.  Drawing on minority stress theory 
(Meyer, 2003) and recent research on the development 
of suicidal thinking and behavior following victimization 
(Espelage & Holt, 2013; Klomek et al., 2011), we 
hypothesized that mental health factors may be an 
important factor in helping to explain the strong and 
consistent relationship observed between stressors 
related to anti-transgender bias and lifetime suicide 
attempts among NTDS respondents. Although the 
limited NTDS data related to mental health precluded a 
full testing of this hypothesis, many specific experiences 
of rejection, discrimination, victimization, and violence 
were found to be significantly related to having a 
disabling mental health condition (see Table 21). 
Examples included a weakening of family relationships 
after coming out as transgender, being a victim of 
violence by a family member, becoming homeless after 
coming out, being harassed at work, and being refused 
medical care because of anti-transgender bias. The 
significant relationship between such stressors and 
mental health disability, coupled with our earlier findings 
of the relationship between mental health disability and 
lifetime suicide attempts (Tables 11-13), suggests that 
mental health factors and stressors interact to produce a 
marked vulnerability to suicidal behavior in transgender 
and gender non-conforming individuals.

QUALITY OF LIFE
DISCUSSION
The prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts was 
lowest (31%) among respondents who felt that being 
transgender or gender non-conforming had not markedly 
affected the quality of their lives (see Table 22). Those 
who felt that their life was “much worse” because they 
were transgender or gender non-conforming had a much 
higher prevalence of suicide attempts (56%).  
The most striking finding of our analysis was the 
exceptionally high prevalence of lifetime suicide 
attempts reported by NTDS respondents. In looking 
at the percentages reporting a lifetime attempt within 
various subgroups of the overall sample, we repeatedly 
found “lows” in the range of 30 to 40 percent, while the 
“highs” exceeded 50 or even 60 percent. Even taking 
into consideration that some degree of over-reporting 
likely occurred in the survey, the results suggest these 
transgender and gender non-conforming respondents 
have experienced exceptionally high levels of suicidality. 
 
 
 
 
Notwithstanding the several significant limitations of the 
NTDS data that we noted at the outset of this report, 
our analysis suggests some tentative findings related 
to risk and protective factors for suicide 
attempts among transgender and gender 
non-conforming adults.  Two interrelated 
risk factors appear to be most strongly 
related to suicidal behavior among 
transgender and gender non-conforming 
adults: rejection, discrimination, 
victimization, and violence related to 
anti-transgender bias and serious mental 
health conditions.  In this study, we found 
a markedly high prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts 
among respondents who reported experiencing 
stressors related to anti-transgender bias, and among 
those who reported having a mental health condition 
that substantially affects a major life activity. In addition, 
our analyses suggest that these two sets of risk factors 
are closely related. 
 
Significantly higher prevalence of lifetime suicide 
attempts was found among respondents who were 
classified as trans women (MTF) and trans men (FTM), 
based on their primary self-identifications. Since trans 
women and trans men are the groups within the overall 
transgender population most likely to need surgical 
care for transition, this may help to explain the high 
prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts we found among 
respondents who said they have had transition-related 
surgical procedures, compared to those who said they 
did not want transition-related surgery. Comparably 
high, or higher, prevalence of suicide attempts 
were found among respondents who said that they 
someday wanted FTM genital surgery, hysterectomy, 
or phalloplasty, suggesting that desiring transition-
related health care services and procedures but not yet 
having them may exacerbate respondents’ distress at 
the incongruence between their gender identity and 
physical appearance.  It is also possible that elevated 
prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts may be due

Discussion - continued
to distress related to barriers to obtaining transition-
related health care, such as a lack of insurance coverage, 
inability to afford the procedures, or lack of access to 
providers. These findings may also be related to the 
higher rates of reported lifetime suicide attempts among 
those who have undergone transition-related surgery. 
As has been noted, the NTDS instrument did not include 
questions about the timing of suicide attempts relative 
to transition, and thus we were unable to determine 
whether suicidal behavior is significantly reduced 
following transition-related surgeries, as some clinical 
studies have suggested (Dixen et al., 1984; De Cuypere 
et al., 2006). 
Respondents’ perceptions that people 
can always or sometimes tell they are 
transgender or gender non-conforming 
were likewise found to be associated 
with high prevalence of lifetime suicide 
attempts. Similarly, higher suicide attempt 
prevalence was found among respondents 
who said they tell “everyone” they are 
transgender or gender non-conforming. In 
this analysis, we were not able to precisely identify how 
perceived recognition by others or disclosure of one’s 
transgender status contributes to suicide risk, although 
our overall results suggest that recognition by others as 
transgender or gender non-conforming, whether actual 
or perceived, significantly increases the likelihood of 
rejection and discrimination, which are clearly related to 
increased risk of suicidal behavior.
In contrast, prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts was 
found to be significantly lower among respondents, 
who described their gender identity as “part time 
as one gender and part time as another,” which may 
suggest more selective disclosure and/or more limited 
perceived recognition by others of transgender or 
gender non-conforming status. This would be consistent 
with the findings of significantly lower prevalence of 
suicide attempts among respondents who said people 
can “never” tell they are transgender or gender non-
conforming, and those who “never” tell anyone they are 
transgender or gender non-conforming. Collectively, 
these findings suggest that not being recognized by 
others as transgender or gender non-conforming may 
function as a protective factor for suicidal behavior. 
Conversely, one’s inability to not be recognized as 
transgender or gender non-conforming may create 
added risk.
Importantly, our analyses suggest that the protective 
effect of non-recognition is especially significant for 
those on the trans feminine spectrum. For people on the 
trans masculine spectrum, however, our data suggest 
that this protective effect may not exist or, in some 
cases, may work in the opposite direction. Clearly, more 
research is needed to illuminate the mechanisms through 
which not being recognized by others as transgender or 
gender non-conforming, whether by not disclosing to 
others or not being perceived as such by others, reduces 
suicidal behavior among transgender and gender non-
conforming people.
“Collectively, these findings suggest that not being recognized by

NEED FOR FUTURE STUDIES
Transgender people are estimated to constitute 0.3 
percent of the U.S. population (Gates, 2011). Federally-
sponsored population-based surveys are increasingly 
including measures of sexual orientation and gender 
identity, and the data from these surveys will certainly 
help to increase understanding of the characteristics and 
needs of the transgender population. It is unlikely, however, 
that population-based surveys will be able to explore the 
full range of issues that uniquely impact the well-being 
of transgender people, such as barriers to transition-
related health care and the impact of discrimination due 
to anti-transgender bias. Thus, well-designed studies 
that specifically engage the transgender community 
will continue to be needed to identify and illuminate the 
health and mental health needs of transgender people, 
including access to appropriate health care services. 
In light of the clarity with which the NTDS data have 
identified suicidal behavior as a significant threat to the 
well-being of transgender and gender non-conforming 
people, it is recommended that future surveys that include 
these populations devote particular attention to careful 
measurement of suicidal behavior and suicide risk.               
This study has identified several areas that are in 
particular need of further research.  First, more research 
is needed into the timing of suicide attempts in relation 
to age and gender transition status.  In regard to timing 
of suicide attempts and gender transition, some surveys 
and clinical studies have found that transgender people 
are at an elevated risk for suicide attempt during gender 
transition, while rates of suicide attempts decrease 
after gender transition (Whittle et al., 2007; DeCuypere 
et al., 2006; Transgender Equality Network Ireland, 2012).  
Further research is clearly needed on the occurrence of all 
aspects of self-harm behavior, including suicidal ideation, 
suicide attempts and non-suicidal self-injury, in relation to 
gender transition and barriers to transition.  Such research 
would provide better insight into the factors that underlie 
suicidal thinking and behavior among transgender people, 
especially those who want to transition from one gender 
to another, and could serve as the basis for designing 
better interventions and suicide prevention services for this 
population.
Second, further research is needed to examine 
the interrelationship of rejection, discrimination, 
victimization, and violence related to anti-transgender 
bias and serious mental health conditions.  In-depth 
studies using in-person interviews and clinical measures 
are also needed to determine the independent and 
combined effects of these two factors in creating a 
pathway to suicidal behavior in transgender and gender 
non-conforming populations.  Such studies could not 
only provide the basis for better interventions, but 
could also underscore the need to address through 
public policy the high levels of rejection, discrimination, 
victimization, and violence experienced by transgender 
and gender non-conforming people.
Finally, prior studies have suggested that lack of 
disclosure and attempts to conceal sexual orientation 
contributes to lower levels of mental health for lesbian, 
gay and bisexual individuals (Meyer, 2003; Pachankis, 
2007; Hatzenbuehler, 2009; Schrimshaw, Siegel, 
Downing & Parsons, 2013).  Explanatory mechanisms 
that have been posited include the stress of constant 
vigilance and concern about being “outed,” internalized 
homophobia, and loss of potential emotional support 
from others.  Our findings suggest that non-disclosure 
may function differently for transgender and gender 
non-conforming people.  As we have noted, one possible 
explanation is that limiting disclosure of transgender or 
gender non-conforming status reduces the likelihood 
of experiencing bias-related rejection, discrimination, 
victimization, and violence, which in turn, reduces 
the likelihood suicidal behavior. This appears to be an 
additional important area for future research.
