Some studies suggest that prenatal infection increases risk of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). This study was undertaken in a
prospective cohort in Norway to examine whether we could find evidence to support an association of the prenatal occurrence of
fever, a common manifestation of infection, with ASD risk. Prospective questionnaires provided maternal exposure data; case status
was established from clinical assessments and registry linkages. In a large, prospectively ascertained cohort of pregnant mothers
and their offspring, we examined infants born ⩾ 32 weeks for associations between fever exposure in each trimester and ASD risk
using logistic regression. Maternal exposure to second-trimester fever was associated with increased ASD risk, adjusting for
presence of fever in other trimesters and confounders (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 1.40; 95% confidence interval, 1.09–1.79), with a
similar, but nonsignificant, point estimate in the first trimester. Risk increased markedly with exposure to three or more fever
episodes after 12 weeks' gestation (aOR, 3.12; 1.28–7.63). ASD risk appears to increase with maternal fever, particularly in the second
trimester. Risk magnified dose dependently with exposure to multiple fevers after 12 weeks' gestation. Our findings support a role
for gestational maternal infection and innate immune responses to infection in the pathogenesis of at least some cases of ASD.

INTRODUCTION
Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are associated with prenatal
exposure to a wide range of infectious agents.1–4 The diversity of
potential infectious triggers suggests that host factors, such as
activation of maternal immunity, may have a role in the genesis of
neurodevelopmental consequences.5 Consistent with this con-
cept, some studies have demonstrated higher levels of inflam-
matory cytokines in amniotic fluid6 or maternal mid-gestational
serum.7 Maternal responses to infection, therefore, including the
timing of fever episodes relative to fetal brain development and
measures to mitigate fever, may influence risk of ASD.8,9
Maternal fever is common in pregnancy. Twenty percent of
pregnant US women report one or more fever episodes.10
Primarily (though not exclusively) first-trimester fever episodes
have been
linked to severe
brain damage and structural
anomalies.9,11 Although first-trimester exposure may also influ-
ence subsequent more subtle disruptions of brain development,
some investigators have hypothesized that exposure to fever later
in pregnancy should be more strongly related to more subtle
disruptions—including
effects
on
neuronal
migration,12
proliferation12,13 and myelination14—such as those reported in
some studies of ASD.15–19 Few studies have examined the
association of prenatal fever, per se, with autism outcomes, as
opposed to effects of specific types of maternal infection (for
example, influenza). Fever was associated with a 1.4-fold increased
risk of infantile autism in a prospective Danish cohort study
wherein fever reporting was restricted to the first 32 weeks of
gestation.20 Fever persisting for 7 days or more was associated
with a 1.6-fold increased risk for ASD and greater than threefold
increase in risk for infantile autism. A retrospective case–control
study in the US found a twofold increased risk of ASD or another
developmental disorder with prenatal fever; risk was lower in
mothers treated with antipyretics.21 However, no prospective
studies have examined risk after fever across all of pregnancy or in
conjunction with antipyretic use. In addition, prior work has not
examined the possibility that different classes of antipyretics may
differentially influence fever risk through their distinct biological
effects. These include acetaminophen, an antipyretic with minimal
anti-inflammatory effects that is used by over 50% of women in
both Scandinavia22 and the US23 at least once during pregnancy
that also affects oxidative stress,24 endocrine25 and cannabioid
receptor pathways,26 and ibuprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflam-
matory drug (NSAID). Understanding the influence on ASD risk of
exposure to multiple fever events, and of the timing of these
episodes across pregnancy, is also incomplete. Here we report
results from a study in a Norwegian birth cohort where
questionnaires and capture of cases through a national registry
allowed us to investigate associations between prenatal fever and
ASD risk. We also examined the potential for antipyretics to
modify risk.

 multiple births or with birth weight o2500 grams or gestational age
o32 weeks (6.6%, Supplementary Figure S1) were excluded. Given
questionnaire design, we focused on subjects with gestational ages
⩾ 32 weeks to ensure that all women could report fever for at least the first
4 weeks of the third trimester. Low birth weight is associated with a
multitude of pre- and postnatal risk factors; thus, we also excluded subjects
with low birth weight.29 This exclusion was also motivated by the nearly
complete overlap in our study population of preterm and low birth weight
status (887 subjects out of 892 with gestational age o32 weeks had low
birth weight, or 99.44%).
Studies were approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and
Health Research Ethics for Southeastern Norway and the Columbia
University Medical Center Institutional Review Board.
Case diagnoses
ASD cases were identified through MoBa screening (3, 5 and 7 years),
referrals and annual linkages to the Norwegian Patient Register (NPR).30
Through 2012, potential cases were invited for assessment by research
clinicians using standardized diagnostic instruments.31,32 Best-estimate
ASD diagnoses were assigned using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR)33 criteria. ASD
cases among NPR-identified children not evaluated at the ABC Study Clinic
were those assigned International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision
(ICD-10) F84 diagnoses (Supplementary Methods).34 NPR ASD diagnoses
have high validity: 58 out of 60 children with NPR ASD diagnoses met
DSM-IV-TR ASD criteria at later ABC clinic assessment (positive predictive
value: 96.7%, 95% confidence interval (CI), 87.5–99.4%; false positive rate:
3.3%, 95% CI, 0.6–12.5%).30
To explore the possibility that prenatal fever effects may be specific for
certain ASD phenotypes, cases were classified as ASD with or ASD without
mental retardation/intellectual disability (ID). Comorbidity with ID was
based on intelligence quotient (IQ) data from ABC clinic assessments, as
available (IQo70)11 or NPR ICD-10 data consistent with a diagnosis of an
ID. ASD cases without an ABC clinic IQ score o70 and who also had not
received an NPR ID ICD-10 code were assigned to the ASD without ID
group (Supplementary Methods).
Exposure data
Exposure timing.
Data on prenatal fever and antipyretic use were
obtained from questionnaires completed around gestational weeks 17
and 30, and 6 months postpartum. Mothers reported fever and medication
use
in
4-week
intervals
through
13+
and
29+
weeks’
gestation,
respectively, on the 17- and 30-week questionnaires and from gestational
week 30 through parturition on the 6-month postnatal questionnaire
(Supplementary Table S1). An interval was considered positive for fever or
antipyretic exposure if one or more exposures occurred during that
interval. Trimesters were designated by gestational weeks as: first,
0–12 weeks; second, 13–28 weeks; and third, 29 weeks through birth.
Overlap in timing across questionnaires was resolved as described in
Supplementary Methods. Main analyses included women with at least one
completed questionnaire containing prenatal data.
Fever and antipyretic exposures.
Questionnaire items solicited data from
mothers regarding the presence of specific conditions, including fever,
along with their timing, as well as the names of medications used for fever,
and the timing of that medication use. Response options for presence and
timing of fever episodes and medication use varied across the three
questionnaires (Supplementary Table S1). To enhance cross-questionnaire
comparability, we collapsed data for 17-week questionnaire items—fever
with rash and fever 438.5 °C—into one category. Questionnaire-specific
procedures for counting fever episodes and assigning their timing to
specific trimesters are detailed further in Supplementary Methods.
We assessed use of any acetaminophen- or ibuprofen-containing
medications for the reported indication of fever. Methods for addressing
report of multiple medications and timing of medication use are described
in Supplementary Methods, along with secondary analysis procedures for
examining risk modification by antipyretic use (acetaminophen or the
NSAID, ibuprofen).
Supplementary Table S2 summarizes methods for resolving discrepan-
cies in reported fever timing and in the timing of antipyretic use in
relationship to fever episodes, along with the number of affected subjects.
Inconsistency in reported fever timing took on three major forms. First,
some mothers indicated timing of the medication taken for fever and the
name of the antipyretic, but failed to report the specific timing of fever
episodes for which they reported taking an antipyretic. In these instances,
maternally provided medication timing defined the fever timing. Second,
when timing of fever episodes was provided but timing of the selected
fever-associated antipyretics (acetaminophen, ibuprofen) was not, mater-
nally provided fever timing defined the timing of medication use. Third,
missing fever timings were imputed for the high-exposure subset of
mothers who endorsed the 'fever more than three times' item on the 30-
week questionnaire but failed to provide complete timing for all reported
fever episodes (Supplementary Methods). Supplementary Table S2 shows
that the number of affected women, and thus the scope of the problem,
was small.
Potential confounders
We evaluated variables that might influence associations between primary
maternal exposures (fever in all three trimesters) and ASD risk: maternal
age; smoking and parity; parental education; birth month; and birth year
(Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Tables S3A and S3B).
Potential confounders demonstrating a significant association (Po0.05)
with both the primary exposure (fever in any of the three trimesters) and
the outcome (ASD) were retained in our analyses.
Statistical analysis
Main
analyses.
Crude
and
adjusted
odds
ratios
(ORs
and
aORs,
respectively) of ASD risk in association with maternal fever in each
trimester, and for any time during pregnancy, and their associated 95% CIs
were estimated by logistic regression. We first examined associations
between fever and risk by fitting separate models for each time period,
using all subjects responding to at least one questionnaire containing
prenatal data. Analyses examining ASD risk in association with fever at any
time during pregnancy included subjects responding to all questionnaires.
Subsequent analyses restricted the study sample to mothers who
responded to all questionnaires addressing prenatal fever. We used three
adjusted models: (1) Adjusted Model 1 (aOR1), adjusting for fever exposure
in either/both of the other trimesters; (2) Adjusted Model 2 (aOR2),
adjusting for all other selected confounders; and (3) Adjusted Model 3
(aOR3), adjusting for both fever in other trimesters and all confounders.
This same population of respondents was used for stratified analyses
comparing ASD risk in association with prenatal fever within the subgroup
of ASD cases with comorbid ID and within the ASD subset without such
comorbidity.
Dose–response analyses.
The cumulative effect of maternal fever was
estimated by counting numbers of individual time intervals wherein
mothers reported fever episodes. We categorized fever exposure into three
levels (0 (referent), 1–2, ⩾ 3 episodes), with exposure periods of any time
during pregnancy or 412 weeks of gestation. Using logistic regression, we
estimated ORs and aORs for both exposure periods.
Fever-associated risk stratified on use of antipyretics.
In exploratory
analyses, we examined whether the risk effect of fever exposure was
modified by acetaminophen use. Mothers reporting fever in each trimester
were divided into two subgroups based on reported use or nonuse of
acetaminophen specifically for fever. Crude and adjusted ORs (aOR1, aOR2
and aOR3, as above) of ASD for each subgroup (compared with the no-
fever referent) were estimated by logistic regression. We performed similar
secondary analyses substituting ibuprofen for acetaminophen to further
examine antipyretic modification of fever-associated ASD risk. Although
both agents reduce fever, as an NSAID, ibuprofen has anti-inflammatory
potential that acetaminophen does not; if, as prior studies have suggested,
fever-related activation of maternal immunity mediates neurodevelop-
mental consequences among offspring, use of ibuprofen as an antipyretic
might be anticipated to be associated with greater reduction in fever-
associated ASD risk than acetaminophen (Supplementary Methods).
Supplementary and sensitivity analyses.
Influences of confounders on ORs
of ASD were examined individually and sequentially (Supplementary
Methods and Supplementary Tables S4A and S4B).
To address possible influences relating to trends across birth years in
ASD prevalence (incomplete ascertainment of cases in later birth years,
given follow-up in some subjects only through age 5) and maternal fever
report, we performed an analysis of fever effects stratified by early
(1999–2004) and late (2005–2009) birth year periods.

 We also examined fetal sex effects. Trophoblasts from male placentae are
reported to respond to infection-related signals with proinflammatory
cytokine production,35,36 consistent with studies suggesting increased risk of
preterm birth in males, particularly in the context of infection.36–38 Because
of low numbers of girls with ASD, we pursued potential influences of sex
through sensitivity analyses restricted to boys (Supplementary Methods).
Other sensitivity analyses addressed potential biases relating to
gestational age at birth and fever timing imputation. Preterm births

fever and antipyretic events in later pregnancy; thus, we restricted to term
births (that is, gestational age 436 weeks) in sensitivity analyses. In an
additional sensitivity analysis, we excluded mothers who reported high
levels of fever exposure on the 30-week questionnaire (43 fever episodes)
without specifying the timing of those episodes (Supplementary Methods).
RESULTS
Study cohort
The study sample included 95 754 children (51.4% boys) after
exclusions (Supplementary Figure S1). Mean age was 9.4 years
(s.d., 2.2 years; range, 5.6–15.2 years) by end of follow-up
(31 December, 2014).
Table 1 shows characteristics of mothers and their pregnancies
vis-à-vis prenatal fever and offspring diagnosis (ASD, non-case).
The mothers of 15 701 children (16.4%) reported fever in one or
more 4-week intervals throughout pregnancy. Women reporting
fever were more likely to have offspring at earlier gestational ages
(o39 weeks), in later cohort birth years (⩾2005) and in March
through August. Fever exposures were more prevalent, and ASD
less prevalent, in more recent birth years (Table 1; Spearman’s
rank correlation coefficient: both Po0.0001).
Autism spectrum disorder
We identified 583 cases of ASD (0.6%) through 2014. Males were
overrepresented fivefold (Table 1). Mothers of ASD children were
younger and less educated than non-case mothers and more
likely to smoke and be first-time mothers. ASD offspring identified
through end of follow-up were also more often born in earlier
cohort years (o2006; higher prevalence of children not yet old
enough to be diagnosed).
Main models
Table 2 shows associations between prenatal fever exposure and
ASD risk for any time in pregnancy and by trimester. Women
reporting fever at any time during pregnancy had increased odds
of ASD in both unadjusted and adjusted models. Examining by
trimester, offspring of mothers with second-trimester fever had a
1.4-fold increased risk in adjusted models (aOR, 1.40; 1.11–1.77).
The first trimester showed similar, but nonsignificant, point
estimates (aOR, 1.34; 0.89–2.02).
The presence of fever in the first trimester was associated with
fever episodes in other trimesters. Second-trimester fever was also
associated with fever in the third trimester (Pearson’s Χ2-test: all
associations, Po0.0001). To permit analyses that could adjust the
fever-associated risk found in one trimester by accounting for
fever episodes in other trimesters, we restricted to mothers
completing all questionnaires containing prenatal data. As with
results using all questionnaire respondents, offspring of mothers
with second-trimester fever had increased risk in the crude model
(OR, 1.33; 1.04–1.70; Table 3). Adjustment for fever in other
trimesters had little effect. Fever-associated risk in second
trimester was similar when adjusting for confounders either alone
or in combination with presence of fever in other trimesters
(Table 3). The first trimester showed similar but nonsignificant
point estimates.
Fever-associated risk in ASD subsets with and without ID.
As
compared with non-cases, ASD cases with comorbid ID showed a
tendency toward increased fever-associated risk in fully adjusted
models both with exposure in the first (aOR3, 2.28; 0.91–5.75) and
the second trimesters (aOR3, 1.64; 0.89–3.03). For ASD cases
without ID, fever-associated risk was modestly but significantly
increased (1.36-fold) and restricted to second-trimester exposures
(Supplementary Table S5).
Dose–response
models.
With
exposure
at
any
time
during
pregnancy, risk increased 1.3-fold with one to two fever episodes
(aOR, 1.31;
1.04–1.64) and more
than
twofold (albeit not
significant) with three or more episodes (aOR, 2.15; 0.95–4.84).
After gestational week 12, risk increased with higher frequency of
exposure (one to two episodes: aOR, 1.30; 1.02–1.66; three or more
episodes: aOR, 3.12; 1.28–7.63; Table 4).
Fever-associated risk stratified on use of antipyretics.
In secondary
stratified analyses, we examined whether use of acetaminophen
for fever modified fever-associated ASD risk. Risk tended to be
lower
within
each
trimester
in
febrile
women
who
took
acetaminophen for fever than in febrile women who did not
(compared
to
the
referent
group
of
afebrile
women;
Supplementary Table S6A). The risk was similar both for women
febrile in the second trimester who did and who did not
specifically report taking acetaminophen for fever.
Additional secondary stratified analyses examined the potential
for modification of fever-associated risk through the use of the
NSAID, ibuprofen, given that, unlike acetaminophen, it has
anti-inflammatory properties in addition to its antipyretic effects.
These analyses were compromised by overall small numbers and
cells with zero values. Among febrile women whose offspring
were later diagnosed with ASD, none had taken ibuprofen for
fever in any trimester (Supplementary Table S6B).

 marked influence on ORs in the second trimester compared with
other confounders; however, the magnitude of these effects was
quite modest (Supplementary Materials; Supplementary Tables
S4A and S4B).
We pursued a series of sensitivity analyses to determine
whether effects differed in early vs late birth years (1999–2004
vs 2005–2009), as well as for boys, term births (excluding children
born at gestational weeks 32–36) or offspring of mothers
providing complete, or nearly complete, fever timing on the 30-
week questionnaire. In fully adjusted analyses stratified on birth
year period, we found that the association of second-trimester
fever with increased odds of ASD was only observed in the earlier
part of the cohort (1999–2004 births, children aged 10–15 years at
end of follow-up: aOR3, 1.86; 1.37–2.52; 2005–2009 births, children
aged 5–9 years at end of follow-up: aOR3, 0.88; 0.57–1.37). We also
found a first-trimester effect restricted to the later birth year
period (2004–2009: aOR3, 1.89; 1.02–3.50; Supplementary Tables
S7A and S7B).
For the remaining sensitivity analyses, we found minimal
differences in ORs (Supplementary Materials and Supplementary
results).
DISCUSSION
Prenatal fever was associated with increased ASD risk among
offspring in the ABC. Effects were strongest in the second
trimester but followed similar patterns in the first. Risks were
minimally mitigated in women taking acetaminophen for fever in
the
second
trimester.
Risks
increased
markedly
and
dose
dependently with fever frequency, with particularly strong effects
after 12 weeks’ gestation.
The strengths of our study are its basis in a large, prospective,
population-based birth cohort with exposure data collected in 4-
week intervals and linkage to a patient registry for case
ascertainment. Maternal self-reporting and differences across the
three questionnaires may contribute to some exposure misclassi-
fication; however, differential reporting is minimized by our study
design, as fever reporting precedes the diagnosis of autism.
Maternal self-report may also detect fevers that healthcare records
might miss. In addition, the overall rate of maternally reported
fever in our cohort across pregnancy (16.4%) was similar to that
reported in a retrospective study in the US (20.5%) for any fever
with infection during pregnancy.10
Our findings complement prior literature on prenatal fever and
ASD risk.20,21 Prospective examination of fever exposures through
birth revealed that fever-associated risk, most prominent in
second trimester, was not influenced by the presence of fever in
the other two trimesters. Similar patterns pertained for the first
trimester but not the third. The only prior prospective study found
an association with prolonged fever in the first and second
trimesters but could not exclude a possible third-trimester effect,
as no data were collected after 32 weeks’ gestation.20
To our knowledge, there are no other prospective studies
examining maternally reported use of antipyretics for fever and
ASD. A retrospective study reporting an association of first- and
second-trimester fever with increased ASD risk found that
acetaminophen and NSAIDs mitigated fever-associated risks.21
Data were not separately reported for antipyretics with and
without anti-inflammatory potential. Here we found only small risk
reduction with use of acetaminophen for fever in conjunction with
a small increase in risk among febrile women who did not take
acetaminophen. In contrast, none of the women with offspring
later diagnosed with ASD used ibuprofen for fever in pregnancy,
although these findings must be interpreted with extreme
caution, given the low overall frequency of ibuprofen use in this
population.
ASD is associated with increased prevalence of autoimmune
disorders in mothers and first-degree relatives.39 Microglial

or

niscent of ASD. Evidence from these models suggests that
maternal fever-associated immune responses mediate conse-
quences in offspring47–52 and are abrogated by NSAIDs.47 As in
ASD, effects are most prominent in males.53 Our results are
consistent with these models in that fever is associated with
increased risk, risk is accentuated in males and antipyretics tend to
decrease fever-associated risk.
Questionnaire analysis did not indicate an association between
risk and maternally reported symptoms of infection in individual
organ systems that might implicate specific infectious agents.
Nonetheless, we are testing the possibility that risk is associated
with specific infectious agents through sequence-based and
serological assays of samples collected mid-pregnancy and at
birth from cases and controls. Linkage to patient register data,
including hospitalization records, may also be used in future work
to confirm timing and severity of illness episodes. Other evidence
relating to severity of illness, such as degree of fever, may also
prove informative; however, study questionnaires did not ask
mothers to report this information for all time periods in
pregnancy.
We acknowledge that our findings are limited by small
numbers, particularly for first- and third-trimester exposures to
fever and antipyretics; replication in other populations will also be
critical before determining the implications of this work for
management of fever in pregnancy. However, factors besides
small numbers may have contributed to the wider CI we obtained
for the first-trimester effect across all birth years, including shorter
length of follow-up for ASD outcomes among younger cohort
children, heterogeneity in the composition of the ASD group, or
both. Our analyses stratified on earlier vs later birth year periods—
despite even smaller numbers than in analyses including all birth
years—provide evidence within the later birth year group of a
more robust first-trimester effect (1.89-fold, with CIs excluding 1).
Although the difference between aORs by birth year are not
statistically significant in either trimester comparison, precision is
lacking for testing such an interaction, and birth-year-dependent
differences in the composition of the ASD group (DSM-IV-TR
subsets) may have influenced our trimester-based results.
It is also important to bear in mind that causality cannot be
definitively established through observational research. None-
theless, we found consistently increased risk with higher levels of
fever exposure. Opposing patterns of prevalence of ASD and fever
exposure in our study sample—decreased prevalence of ASD but
increased prevalence of fever exposure in later cohort years—may
have biased results. However, our age-specific ASD prevalence
patterns are similar to those reported in other work in Norway54 as
well as other Nordic countries, where diagnoses are often
registered at ages far exceeding those at which symptoms
typically begin.55 Follow-up studies may resolve whether ASD
underascertainment in younger cohort children diminished effect
sizes. Birth in later cohort years had a greater influence on
ascertainment of higher-functioning cases, as these subsets are
typically diagnosed at older ages, as well as more generally for
younger members of the cohort, based on reduced length of
follow-up. The case sample is thus perhaps weighted toward more
severe cases. However, the rate of ID comorbidity did not vary
substantially between early and late birth year periods (15.30 vs
13.99%, respectively). Although ID is not a simple proxy for ASD
severity, our key finding—an increase in risk for ASD in association
with maternal second-trimester fever—was restricted to ASD
without ID, suggesting a degree of specificity. Prenatal fever
increased risk in the ASD group with ID in the first but not the
second trimester, consistent with previous work indicating a
relationship of first-trimester fever exposure with severe structural
defects of the central nervous and other organ systems.9 More
conclusive analysis awaits detection of additional cases with
extended follow-up.
Our findings support the hypothesis that fever and associated
immune disturbances are implicated in a subset of ASD cases.
Although acetaminophen was associated with a small decrease in
risk in the context of fever, prior studies reporting ablation of
fever-associated risk with use of a diverse range of medications
with antipyretic properties, including NSAIDs as well as acetami-
nophen—along with our own limited data on ibuprofen—suggest
that the choice of antipyretic warrants scrutiny. We have not
addressed microbial causes of maternal fever and immune
activation. Accordingly, future work should focus on identifying
and preventing prenatal infections and inflammatory responses
that may contribute to ASD pathogenesis.
