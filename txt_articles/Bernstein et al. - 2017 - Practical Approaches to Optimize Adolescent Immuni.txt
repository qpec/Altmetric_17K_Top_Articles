abstract
With the expansion of the adolescent immunization schedule during the 
past decade, immunization rates notably vary by vaccine and by state. 
Addressing barriers to improving adolescent vaccination rates is a priority. 
Every visit can be viewed as an opportunity to update and complete an 
adolescent’s immunizations. It is essential to continue to focus and refi
 ne 
the appropriate techniques in approaching the adolescent patient and 
parent in the offi
 ce setting. Health care providers must continuously 
strive to educate their patients and develop skills that can help parents 
and adolescents overcome vaccine hesitancy. Research on strategies to 
achieve higher vaccination rates is ongoing, and it is important to increase 
the knowledge and implementation of these strategies. This clinical report 
focuses on increasing adherence to the universally recommended vaccines 
in the annual adolescent immunization schedule of the American Academy 
of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, and the American Congress of Obstetricians 
and Gynecologists. This will be accomplished by (1) examining strategies 
that heighten confi
 dence in immunizations and address patient and parental 
concerns to promote adolescent immunization and (2) exploring how best to 
approach the adolescent and family to improve immunization rates.
CLINICAL REPORT
Guidance for the Clinician in Rendering Pediatric Care
INTRODUCTION
Immunization is a key preventive cornerstone of pediatric care. 
1 Current 
data show a need for improvement in adolescent immunization rates. 
2 
Healthy People 2020 lists 3 adolescent health indicators, which focus 
on the proportion of adolescents who have (1) well visits, (2) medical 
insurance, and (3) vaccination coverage. 
3 Unfortunately, there is a 
notable downward trend in health care utilization from childhood to 
early adulthood. One study found that the overall rate for any health 
care utilization was 88%, 83%, and 72% for 0- through 11-year-olds, 
12- through 17-year-olds, and 18- through 25-year-olds, respectively. 
4 
Another study documented that early adolescents (11 through 14 years of 
age) had 3 times more preventive visits than late adolescents.5 Without

a consistent source of care, young 
adults have significantly lower rates 
of overall health services usage, 
lower rates of office-based utilization, 
 
6 
and higher rates of emergency 
department visits. These trends in 
health care utilization underscore the 
importance of the establishment of 
a longitudinal relationship within a 
medical home. It has been suggested 
that the adolescent immunization 
schedule would draw even more 
adolescents to the pediatrician’s 
office, where additional necessary 
screening and preventive services 
could be performed. 
7, 
 
8 Familiarity 
with this information should enable 
pediatricians to create better 
implementation strategies to enhance 
vaccine coverage. An overview 
of the epidemiology, current 
recommendations, and barriers 
associated with the adolescent 
immunization schedule is discussed 
in a separate clinical report, “The 
Need to Optimize Adolescent 
Immunization” (www. 
pediatrics. 
org/ 
cgi/ 
doi/ 
10. 
1542/ 
peds. 
2016- 
4186).
Physician recommendation and 
explanation are essential to boosting 
immunization rates. Yet, strikingly, 
up to 65% of parents reported 
not receiving a recommendation 
from a health care provider for 
immunizations. 
9 The major reason 
for nonreceipt of tetanus toxoid, 
reduced diphtheria toxoid, and 
acellular pertussis, adsorbed 
(Tdap), and meningococcal vaccines 
was lack of health care provider 
recommendation. In a 2009 survey, 
87.9% and 90.6% of parents whose 
children did not receive the Tdap 
and meningococcal vaccines, 
respectively, reported not receiving 
a recommendation. Nonreceipt of 
human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine 
was associated with a perception 
that the vaccine was “not necessary.” 
Similarly, a 2013 study revealed that 
only 64.4% of parents of girls and 
41.6% of parents of boys reported 
receiving a recommendation for the 
HPV vaccine from their child’s health 
care provider. 
10  
Table 1 lists the 
major reasons for not receiving Tdap, 
meningococcal, and HPV vaccines. 
Parents were significantly more likely 
to report the intention to vaccinate 
their child if they received a health 
care provider recommendation, 
compared with parents who received 
no provider recommendation (48.9% 
vs 33.6%; P < .001).

quality-improvement projects and 
educational materials for providers 
(http://

immunization rates in adolescents, 
which will be discussed in further 
detail in this report.
STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING 
ADOLESCENT VACCINATION RATES
Every encounter should be viewed 
as a potential opportunity to 
immunize. 
2 In a 2010 survey, 
primary care physicians indicated 
that they often relied on vaccine-
only visits and nurse prompts to 
identify and address vaccine need. 
Strategies physicians reported they 
would consider using, but had not 
implemented, included patient 
reminder/recall systems and 
electronic health record prompts. 
11, 
 
12 
Through advancements in electronic 
health records, providers can set 
reminders for immunizations and 
make a patient’s immunization 
record accessible during any visit. 
13 
Providers can also set up a reminder/
recall system, which consists of 
sending reminders about upcoming 
recommended vaccines to patients 
along with recalls that encourage 
patients who are overdue for 
vaccines to return to the office for 
appropriate immunization. These 
population health management 
activities have the potential to be 
powerful and cost-effective tools.

Overcoming Vaccine Hesitancy
Vaccine hesitancy in adolescent 
health care can be challenging to 
address. 
14 The AAP has recently 
published a clinical report 
that provides information for 
pediatricians to address vaccine-
hesitant parents. 
14 The following are 
important approaches that providers 
should use to increase vaccination 
rates:
1. Strongly endorse all universally 
recommended vaccines as 
important for adolescents’ 
health. Offering immunizations 
as optional opens the door for 
vaccine dismissal. The health care 
provider should inform the patient 
and family about which vaccines 
are recommended at the current 
visit. Health care providers also 
should state the vaccines the 
adolescent needs without seeming 
to favor one vaccine over another. 
Discussion of any concerns or 
questions can then begin, if 
needed.
2. When encountering hesitancy 
toward a vaccine, answer parents’ 
questions and concerns and 
remain unwavering, as medically 
appropriate. By asking an open-
ended question, such as “What 
concerns do you have?, 
” the 
health care provider can allow for 
better dialogue. Parents who ask 
questions may not be hesitant; 
they may be seeking more 
information. Health care providers 
should always remember that 
immunizations are the core of 
preventive care. It is important 
to emphasize, “This is my job in 
helping you care for your child: to 
inform you of the recommended 
vaccines and the diseases they 
prevent, and thereby protect your 
child the best way we can.”
3. Focus on the benefits of the 
vaccine. Educating the patient 
and family on the diseases that 
vaccines prevent is key. For 
example, patients and families 
are more likely to be receptive if 
the health care provider informs 
them and reinforces the fact that 
HPV vaccine can prevent cancer, 
that Tdap vaccine can prevent 
pertussis, and that meningococcal 
vaccine can prevent meningitis. 
Up-to-date information on current 
events and disease outbreaks is a 
tool to bring into the conversation 
about vaccines as well. Health 
care providers also can increase 
parental confidence and trust in 
vaccines by mentioning that they

give the same vaccines to their 
families.
4. Make the family aware of 
when the vaccines are needed. 
In addition to informing the 
family which vaccines the 
child needs or why they are 
needed, it is important for the 
health care provider to review 
the appropriate timeline for 
completing the vaccine series. 
For example, it is important for 
parents to be aware of the ages 
when HPV vaccine can be given, 
when to return for each dose in 
the series, and the importance 
of receiving the vaccine before a 
teenager is likely to be exposed 
to HPV through sexual activity. 
Follow-up immunization visits 
should be scheduled before the 
family leaves the care setting.
5. If vaccine refusal occurs, 
persevere. Although it may 
be challenging, it is important 
that health care providers offer 
the vaccine at the next most 
appropriate time. Perseverance 
is critical for vaccine uptake 
and immunization rates. In the 
Periodic Survey of Fellows 
(PS 66) conducted by the AAP 
in 2006 and a follow-up survey 
in 2013 (PS 84), pediatricians 
reported that they were able to 
convince approximately 30% of 
parents to vaccinate their children 
after they initially refused. 
14 
Another observational study 
found that up to 47% of parents 
who were initially resistant 
ultimately accepted vaccines when 
providers pursued their original 
recommendations. 
15 The health 
care provider should document 
vaccine discussions and any 
vaccine refusal (http:// 
www. 
cdc. 
gov/ 
vaccines/ 
hcp/ 
patient- 
ed/ 
conversations/ 
downloads/ 
not- 
vacc- 
risks- 
color- 
office. 
pdf). 
The AAP clinical reports on 
responding to parental refusals of 
immunization are useful resources 
that may assist physicians in 
overcoming this challenge. 
14, 
 
16
In further exploring the reasons 
for vaccine hesitancy, health 
care providers assess for vaccine 
readiness and the parents’ 
position and feelings on vaccines, 
emphasize the benefits of vaccines, 
clarify misconceptions, and 
determine whether there is a lack 
of understanding or education 
about a specific vaccine. It is also 
important to consider the beliefs, 
misperceptions, and concerns 
among specific ethnic populations 
and to be aware that culturally 
tailored, translated information can 
help inform strategies to improve 
adolescent vaccine uptake in these 
populations. 
17 Sharing related 
statistics and educational material 
can be helpful, but information 
overload should be avoided. The 
concept of “chunking and checking” 
refers to the provision of information 
in small chunks followed by checking 
the person’s understanding. This 
technique contrasts with the 
common practice of providing much 
larger amounts of information 
before checking, which can lead to 
information overload. 
18 Although 
1 randomized trial did not show 
an effect of physician-targeted 
communication interventions on 
vaccine hesitancy, these suggestions 
can be helpful, even though their 
effects are not proven. 
19 Most 
important, physicians should 
avoid confrontation, reflect on and 
summarize the conversation, and 
schedule follow-up to reinforce the 
value of immunization.  
Table 2 lists 
helpful and unhelpful strategies in 
navigating a vaccine discussion.
Approaching the Adolescent Patient in 
the Offi
 ce Setting
Adolescents should be encouraged 
to follow the AAP preventive health 
care recommendations for routine 
visits; every visit can be viewed as an 
opportunity to update and complete 
an adolescent’s immunizations. 
2, 
 
20 
Adolescent health visits are enhanced 
by fostering and maintaining a 
relationship with both the parent 
and the adolescent. Education about 
adolescent health issues should be a 
highlight of each encounter. A portion 
of the adolescent visit should be 
between the health care provider and 
the adolescent without the presence 
of a parent. To the extent permitted 
by applicable law, confidentiality is 
important and should be emphasized 
to all adolescents so they feel 
more comfortable sharing their 
perspectives. Health care providers 
can reduce vaccine hesitancy by 
establishing rapport and a supportive 
relationship with patients and by 
providing appropriate education. 
21
Understanding adolescent cognitive 
development will facilitate the 
interaction with adolescents and 
their health care. The adolescent 
years are a stage in which the mind 
is developing and adolescents 
begin to acquire reasoning skills

and the ability to think abstractly. 
Adolescents may not perceive 
the consequences of risk-taking 
behavior. They also are in a period in 
which they seek independence and 
strive to obtain such independence. 
It is important to be aware of 
the aforementioned adolescent 
framework and to be attuned to the 
adolescent’s needs during office 
visits. 
22
Motivational interviewing is a 
strategy that can be used when 
approaching the adolescent patient 
and family. 
23 It is “a collaborative, 
person-centered form of guiding 
to elicit and strengthen motivation 
for change.” 
24 Motivational 
interviewing is anticipated to 
result in changing behavior and 
encouraging self-reflection. The idea 
behind motivational interviewing 
is to allow the patient and parents 
to come to their own conclusion 
regarding the importance of and 
need for immunization. This 
behavioral change occurs by having 
the parent reflect on the need to 
protect the adolescent against 
preventable diseases (eg, cervical 
cancer and meningitis). Motivational 
interviewing can be used to improve 
vaccine acceptance and overcome 
hesitancy.
The core skills used in motivational 
interviewing include the following:
 
• asking open-ended questions, 
 
• affirming the patient’s efforts and 
strengths, 
 
• being a reflective listener, and
 
• assessing readiness to change.
Approaching the Parent in the Offi
 ce 
Setting
To optimize adolescent 
immunization, it is necessary to 
understand the range of parental 
attitudes toward vaccines. By 
doing so, providers are then able 
to address potential dilemmas. 
Approximately 40% of initially 
vaccine-hesitant parents stated that 
health care provider information and 
reassurance were major reasons why 
they changed their mind. 
21  
Table 3 lists Halperin’s 8-step 
approach in responding to parents 
when encountering vaccine 
hesitancy. 
25 The best approach to 
handling vaccine-hesitant parents 
requires understanding the common 
reasons for vaccine hesitancy and 
recognizing the types of vaccine-
hesitant parents. This knowledge will 
then enable the health care provider 
to navigate and direct the vaccine 
conversation down different paths 
depending on the type of hesitancy 
that is being encountered.
There have been attempts to classify 
the different types of parental 
positions toward vaccines. 
26 
– 
28 
The following is a summary of the 
different parental positions ( 
Table 4):
1. The parent who accepts, does not 
question, and may be uninformed, 
but is open to education on 
vaccines, 
 
25 is considered to be the 
unquestioning acceptor 
18 or the 
immunization advocate. 
26 These 
parents may have previously 
heard about reasons not to 
immunize but are information 
seekers and want to hear the 
counter-argument from a vaccine-
supporting health care provider. 
25
2. The well-informed parent who is 
open-minded. These parents have 
a fair amount of knowledge and 
are considered to be “well read” 
regarding vaccine issues. 
25 These 
parents are willing to vaccinate 
with the appropriate information 
and facts. Discussing the risks and 
benefits thoroughly is necessary 
to enable vaccine acceptance. 
Parents may often have “phased 
agreement to immunization, 
” 
meaning that they accept more 
vaccines over time. 
25
3. The parent who is the cautious 
acceptor is willing to vaccinate 
despite their awareness of the 
rare adverse effect profile of 
vaccines. 
25
4. The misinformed parent who is 
open to education and, with the 
appropriate information, is willing 
to vaccinate. 
25 These parents have 
some degree of misinformation 
from the Internet or media, family, 
or friends and can be “resistant” 
to dismiss their originally held 
beliefs but tend to be “correctable” 
and open to change. 
25
5. The vaccine-hesitant parent has 
significant concerns about the 
risks of vaccination. It is 
important for the health care 
provider to establish rapport 
and trust while providing 
information and answering 
questions. The parent may 
not be readily open to vaccine 
acceptance. This parent may also 
be viewed as the late or selective 
vaccinator. This group of parents 
may “delay or select only some 
recommended vaccines.” 
18
6. The vaccine refuser is the parent 
who entirely refuses all vaccines 
because of either philosophical 
or religious beliefs. 
18 These 
parents can also be described 
as “convinced and content” with 
their belief that immunization 
is not beneficial, but rather 
harmful. 
25 Parents can also be 
strong opponents of vaccination 
and “not appreciate the value of 
immunization.” 
25
Strategies aimed toward the diverse 
parental positions include the 
following ( 
Table 4):

1. Building rapport and having brief 
discussions explaining the benefits 
and risks of vaccines to the parent 
who is an unquestioning acceptor 
or a cautious acceptor.
2. Relying on a “guiding style” 
when approaching the vaccine-
hesitant parent, which refers to 
having a helping attitude by (a) 
seeking permission to discuss 
immunization, (b) addressing 
concerns, (c) giving appropriate 
resources, and (d) determining 
readiness to change. Motivational 
interviewing can be used here. 
Providing detailed and up-to-
date information on risks and 
benefits of vaccines is crucial. 
Furthermore, scheduling an 
appointment to further discuss the 
opportunity for immunization at a 
later visit is ideal.
3. Addressing concerns and 
willingness to change while using 
motivational interviewing may be 
a strategy to approach the vaccine 
refuser.
The use of nonstandard schedules is 
a common issue when encountering 
the vaccine-hesitant parent. It 
is important to work with these 
parents to make it more likely that 
immunizations are given at the 
appropriate time. It is recommended 
that health care providers explain 
that the national vaccine schedule 
protects children, adolescents, 
and adults against diseases at the 
youngest age at which a given 
vaccine’s safety and effectiveness 
have been shown. The national 
schedule has been studied for safety 
and effectiveness, but nonstandard 
schedules have not been examined. 
29
Health care providers must establish 
a way to document parental 
refusal of vaccines or requests for 
a nonstandard schedule. The AAP 
Refusal to Vaccinate Form may be 
used as a template to document 
discussion with the parent about 
the risks of failing to immunize 
the child (https:// 
www. 
aap. 
org/ 
en- 
us/ 
Documents/ 
immunization_ 
refusaltovaccinat 
e. 
pdf). Health care 
providers can also create a manual 
of resources to better address 
the vaccine-hesitant parent (see 
Supplemental Information).
Advocating for HPV Immunization
It is important to highlight all of the 
universally recommended vaccines 
in the adolescent immunization 
schedule, rates of which vary by 
vaccine. Indeed, because of various 
unique barriers, HPV vaccine 
immunization rates have lagged 
notably behind those of Tdap and 
meningococcal vaccines. 
30 Therefore, 
the following is a summary of 
how to approach HPV vaccination 
and navigate the encounter (see 
Supplemental Information):
 
• Emphasize that HPV immunization 
prevents cancer. This is a major 
reason that parents accept the 
vaccine.
 
• Discuss the vaccine schedule 
with parents, particularly the 
dosing schedule and the ages of 
administration. In October 2016, a 
2-dose schedule for 9-valent HPV 
was approved by the Advisory 
Committee on Immunization 
Practices for individuals 9 through 
14 years of age. 
31 In a 2014 study 
by Perkins et al, 
 
32 13% of parents 
reported that they thought their 
daughters were “too young” for 
the vaccine. Health care providers 
should instead emphasize that it is 
preferable to deliver the vaccine at 
a younger age, especially because 
this elicits a better immune 
response. Similarly, in a study of 
over 1500 participants, Iversen 
et al 
33 found that geometric mean 
antibody titers against all HPV 
types in the 9-valent HPV vaccine 
were higher in the 9- through 
14-year-old age groups than in the 
16- through 26-year-old female 
adolescents and women. On the 
basis of these data, the HPV vaccine 
may potentially be recommended 
for individuals younger than 11 or 
12 years of age in the future. The 
new dosing schedule also provides 
added flexibility and incentive 
because individuals younger than 
15 years require only 2 shots 
compared with individuals older 
than 15 years who need 3 shots.
 
• Do not delay vaccination, because 
this can be detrimental. A recent 
study cohort showed that both 
providers and parents tended 
to delay HPV vaccine until there 
was a sign that the adolescent 
was approaching sexual activity.

However, attempting to predict 
when the adolescent will become 
sexually active is difficult and 
impractical. In addition, it was 
noted that actual immunization 
might not occur at a later time 
as was previously negotiated 
between the parents and the health 
care provider. 
32 Adolescents are 
less likely than other patients 
to follow up. Therefore, health 
care providers should view the 
current encounter with a “now or 
never” mentality when framing 
their efforts toward immunizing 
adolescents.
 
• Coadminister the HPV vaccine with 
other vaccines, because this can 
boost HPV immunization rates. 
Recommending all the adolescent 
vaccines at the same time increases 
adherence to the immunization 
schedule. It is also more practical 
to give all vaccines at once, because 
adolescent patients often do not 
return for medical care and fail to 
follow up. Adolescents tend to have 
low rates of immunization, and 
health care providers are known to 
overestimate immunization rates. 
32
 
• State that HPV vaccine is part of the 
routine immunization schedule. A 
presumptive delivery strategy is an 
effective communication approach 
in which providers present vaccine 
recommendations as required 
immunizations to maintain 
optimal disease prevention. In 
a randomized clinical trial of 29 
pediatric and family medicine 
clinics in North Carolina, Brewer 
et al found that practices trained in 
the presumptive delivery stratedgy 
exhibited a significant increase 
in HPV vaccine coverage for 
individuals 11 or 12 years of age 
when compared with the control 
group that did not receive any 
additional training. In contrast, a 
conversational delivery strategy 
did not exhibit a significant 
increase when compared with 
control. 
34 The presumptive 
approach may work well with 
some parents, however, and 
pediatricians may use it selectively 
based on their experience. 
14 It is 
important to overcome the concept 
that the HPV vaccine is optional. 
Hull et al demonstrated that 
mothers and daughters were more 
receptive to discussion of the HPV 
vaccine as a routine vaccine that 
prevents cancer. 
35
 
• Clarify the misconception that HPV 
vaccine can promote promiscuity, 
if that is a parental concern.
 
• Emphasize that HPV vaccine is 
a safe vaccine. Approximately 
200 million doses have been 
distributed worldwide between 
2006 and 2015, 
 
36 and no serious 
adverse outcome has been 
associated with HPV vaccine. 
10 The 
safety of HPV vaccine continues 
to be monitored through the CDC 
Vaccine Safety Datalink and the 
US Food and Drug Administration 
PRISM programs. The AAP HPV 
Vaccine Talking Points provides 
additional information concerning 
vaccine safety (https://

Table 5 lists successful techniques in 
advocating for HPV immunization.
Reducing Missed Opportunities
Missed opportunities for adolescent 
immunizations are relatively 
common. Therefore, strategies to 
reduce missed opportunities are 
key in improving immunization 
rates. A retrospective study 
that reviewed electronic health 
records showed that there was a 
significant percentage of missed 
opportunities for immunization: 
82% for meningococcal vaccine, 
85% for Tdap, and 82% for the first 
dose of HPV vaccine. The majority 
of visits that were considered to 
have a missed opportunity were 
sick visits or nonpreventive visits. 
37 
Furthermore, health care providers 
are more attuned to vaccinating 
younger adolescents than their older 
counterparts. 
38
Most health care visits should be 
viewed as opportunities to review 
immunization records, provide 
vaccines that are due, and catch 
up on missed vaccinations. The 
concomitant administration of 
vaccines, when appropriate, is key 
to reducing missed vaccination 
opportunities. For example, in youth 
with special health care needs, 
vaccine coverage may be lacking, 
so concomitant administration of 
adolescent vaccines could reduce 
missed opportunities for this 
vulnerable population. 
39 The majority 
of vaccines are administered during 
well-child visits (eg, sports or camp 
physicals), and several surveys have 
shown that health care providers 
do routinely assess immunization 
status during such visits. 
40 However, 
acute care visits or sick visits in 
the patient-centered medical home 
are also an opportunity to deliver 
vaccines or to discuss upcoming 
vaccines. 
41 Assessing immunization 
status during sick and acute care 
visits is important. The Immunization 
Action Coalition has a valuable parent 
questionnaire entitled “Screening 
Checklist for Contraindications to 
Vaccines for Children and Teens.”

It is feasible for this checklist to be 
routinely used in the office setting 
during both well and sick visits. 
The CDC also has an online quiz for 
adolescents entitled “What vaccines 
do you need?, 
” which is based on 8 
questions that yield a list of vaccines 
the patient should receive when 
submitted.
The CDC Web site provides guidance 
on how to display immunization 
schedules onto a clinic’s Web 
site, which can serve as a helpful 
resource for providers, patients, 
and families (http:// 
www. 
cdc. 
gov/ 
vaccines/ 
schedules/ 
syndicate. 
html#easy- 
read). In addition, the 
CDC now has an available application 
for mobile devices entitled “CDC 
Vaccine Schedule.” The CDC Web 
site includes a tool for parents and 
providers to use to look up school 
immunization requirements. The 
AAP immunization Web site includes 
information for providers about 
case studies on vaccine hesitancy, 
resources for communicating with 
families, immunization technology, 
and vaccine financing, supply, and 
ordering (https:// 
www.

org/ 
en- 
us/ 
advocacy- 
and- 
policy/ 
aap- 
health- 
initiatives/ 
immunization/ 
Pages/ 
default. 
aspx). Health care providers 
should promote these resources 
among their patients and patients’ 
families.
The College Physicians of Philadelphia 
has created a Web site on the 
history of vaccines, which provides 
many interactive learning tools on 
vaccines (historyofvaccines.org) and 
covers the history of antivaccination 
movements, with a focus on measles-
mumps-rubella, the use of thimerosal, 
and autism. This information can help 
decrease parental vaccine refusal.
Using Offi
 ce-Based Technology
Prompts for Health Care Providers
Health care provider prompts 
are a useful and effective way to 
reduce missed opportunities in 
vaccine delivery. 
42 
– 
44 Prompts 
can be electronic, paper-based, 
or generated by immunization 
information systems (previously 
known as “registries”). The health 
care provider will see the prompt and 
then identify whether the adolescent 
is a candidate for immunization. If 
the patient is a candidate, the health 
care provider should then offer the 
indicated vaccine(s). It is important 
for electronic health records to 
incorporate the recommendations 
of the harmonized immunization 
schedule of the AAP, the American 
Academy of Family Physicians, and 
the CDC.
It is also important to establish 
continuity and to enable an adolescent 
to return for a subsequent vaccine 
dose. This result can be accomplished 
by direct communication regarding 
when the subsequent vaccine dose is 
needed, scheduling a follow-up visit 
for immunization during the current 
visit, and providing an after-visit 
summary to the patient and parent to 
serve as a reminder of when to return.
Prompts for Patients
Bright Futures handouts can be 
used in the waiting area or in the 
examination room to emphasize the 
value of immunizations in health 
promotion and disease prevention. 
The use of tablet computers in the 
waiting area also has been found 
to be effective in providing vaccine 
information to parents, although 
meaningful engagement with 
the material was low. 
45 Vaccine 
Information Statements from the 
CDC can be incorporated on a day-
to-day basis in the office setting 
as well. Pediatric offices should 
also make use of immunization 
information systems, because they 
can offer prompts regarding delayed 
immunization or whether a certain 
vaccine is indicated. The use of 
multiple prompts will maximize 
vaccine delivery. Another important 
way to improve vaccine delivery is 
by educating all staff members on 
the recommended immunization 
schedule.
It is helpful for the pediatric office to 
have access to the adolescent’s daily 
schedule (ie, being attuned to school 
hours, extracurricular activities, and 
work hours) and arrange appropriate 
office hours. Setting up exclusive 
immunization clinic days or hours 
is another strategy that can be 
incorporated. 
46
Reminder/Recall Systems for Patients
Electronic health records and 
immunization information systems 
have the capability of running 
reports listing patients who are 
due or overdue for immunizations. 
Delivering reminders via phone call, 
text, or mail can be a useful way of 
targeting patients. 
47 In a managed 
care organization serving publicly 
insured patients, adolescents 11 
through 17 years of age who received 
reminders either by mail or telephone 
had greater immunization rates for 
quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate 
vaccine (MenACWY), Tdap, and HPV 
vaccine compared with adolescents 
who received no intervention. For 
adolescents who were not caught up 
with vaccinations at the start of the 
study, uptake significantly increased 
by 21% for mail-reminder groups 
and by 17% for telephone-reminder 
groups versus only 13% for control 
groups. 
48 A study on HPV vaccination 
rates, conducted in managed care 
organizations, found that text message 
reminders had a modest effect on HPV 
dose 1 rates for those who were able 
to receive the text message with valid 
phone numbers in the database. 
49 In 
another study, postal mail, e-mail, or 
text reminders were used to improve 
adolescent vaccination rates. All 3 
reminder interventions were effective 
in improving adolescent vaccination 
rates. Although postal mail reminders 
were preferred by most parent 
participants, text messaging and 
e-mail were the more effective 
reminder methods. 
50
In a randomized controlled trial 
targeting low-income adolescents 
living in urban neighborhoods,

 PEDIATRICS Volume

March 2017 
a text-messaging intervention 
compared with usual care was 
associated with an increased rate of 
influenza vaccination. 
51 Matheson 
et al 
52 showed that 14% of 
adolescents and young adults who 
received text message reminders for 
their second and third HPV vaccine 
doses completed the vaccine series at 
the optimal time, compared with 3% 
who did not receive the intervention. 
The study also showed patient and 
parent support and eagerness for text 
message reminders. Both adolescents 
and parents reported that they had 
easy access to phones, preferred text 
messages, and found it convenient to 
communicate via phone.
Another successful way of boosting 
immunization rates was shown by 
using an immunization navigator 
intervention in a notable study, 
which entailed (1) a patient tracking 
database, (2) a reminder/recall 
system, and (3) home visits. 
53 The 
patient tracking database allowed the 
entry of immunizations and well visits 
for adolescent patients. Staff members 
would engage in the reminder/recall 
system by calling families and mailing 
letters to notify them about upcoming 
vaccines and well visits. In addition, 
transportation would be facilitated. 
If this measure failed, then the final 
step would be to approach the patient 
and family via home visits. The overall 
immunization rate with the use of this 
intervention was 44.7% compared 
with 32.4% for the control group. 
Preventive care visits also increased 
among the intervention group 
compared with the control group: 
68% versus 55.2%, respectively. 
53 
Another method of facilitating vaccine 
delivery is encouraging providers 
to schedule all follow-up vaccine 
appointments to complete a vaccine 
series, such as that required for HPV 
vaccine. 
38
Extending Care Into School-Based 
Settings
The use of schools as a pathway to 
educate and vaccinate adolescents 
could be helpful to increasing 
immunization rates. Other vaccination 
sites that can facilitate immunizing 
adolescents include pharmacies, 
mobile vans, clinics for substance 
abuse or obstetrics/gynecology 
care, and shelters. Electronic recall/
reminder systems may also be used 
in these alternative vaccination sites. 
However, all vaccinations in any 
setting should be documented within 
the state’s electronic immunization 
information system.
The School as an Alternative 
Vaccination Site
School-based sites for vaccine 
administration offer additional ways 
of providing preventive care to 
adolescents 
54 
 
– 
57 and aid in overcoming 
barriers to access of health care. 
Models for delivering immunizations 
in schools include 3 strategies:
 
• School-based health centers
Although some school-based health 
centers (SBHCs) can meet the 
definition of the medical home for 
their patients, SBHCs, in the context 
of this clinical report, are being used 
to improve adolescents’ health by 
helping to ensure that recommended 
vaccines are received. 
58 The school 
venue is also capable of being a 
primary source of health education. 
59 
A better link between the health and 
educational departments should 
be fostered. Schools and health 
departments should offer routine 
immunizations at minimal expense 
to the patient, which can benefit 
individuals with financial barriers. 
In turn, schools administering 
vaccines should communicate with 
primary care clinics with regard to 
immunizations given. If an adolescent 
receives a vaccine outside of his 
or her medical home, such as at an 
SBHC, appropriate documentation 
of immunization should be provided 
to the adolescent for his or her 
medical home and entered into the 
state immunization registry, where 
possible. The CDC provides a vaccine 
administration template letter that 
providers can use (http:// 
www. 
cdc. 
gov/ 
flu/ 
school/ 
school_ 
located_ 
vac. 
htm).
A retrospective study comparing 
community health centers and SBHCs 
of the Denver Health System revealed 
that SBHCs had significantly higher 
completion rates for the following 
immunizations in adolescents 12 to 
18 years of age 
54: hepatitis B (93% vs 
84%), Tdap (71% vs 62%), varicella 
(20% vs 13%), measles-mumps-
rubella (89% vs 83%), HPV vaccine 
for patients aged 16 through 18 years 
(18% vs 12%), and the HPV vaccine/
Tdap/MenACWY immunization series 
for female patients aged 16 through 
18 years (17% vs 11%). 
54 It has also 
been shown that adolescents who visit 
SBHCs are more likely to complete 
the hepatitis B immunization series 
compared with adolescents who 
visit hospital-based health centers. 
60 
SBHCs may represent one means of 
expanding access to adolescents for 
vaccinations, and they may serve as 
a “safety net” for adolescents who do 
not have reliable access to a medical 
home elsewhere. 
57 Almost two-
thirds of juniors in high school who 
completed a survey about vaccination 
outside the traditional medical home 
believe that SBHCs are definitely or 
probably acceptable locations for 
vaccinations.61
Several surveys have reported that 
most parents accept the use of SBHCs 
to provide immunizations. Although 
most parents (78%) preferred 
a doctor’s office for adolescent 
vaccination, a majority were also 
definitely or probably accepting of 
vaccination in public health clinics 
(74%), school health clinics (70%), 
obstetrics and gynecology clinics 
(69%), and emergency departments 
(67%). 
62 Surveys of adolescents have 
also shown that adolescents feel 
comfortable seeking health care at 
school, 
 
63 which is especially relevant, 
because many pediatric patients do 
not rely on a medical home for care. 
The socioeconomic factors that are 
linked with these patients are as

educational level, Hispanic ethnicity,

States, and speaking a language other 
than English. 
64, 
 
65
 
• Partnering with local practitioners, 
community clinics, or other 
community organizations
Although many schools do not 
have SBHCs, another model for 
providing school-located vaccination 
is partnering schools with public 
health departments to identify 
underimmunized adolescents and 
provide needed vaccines. One 
study in North Carolina examined 
the partnership between the 
school system and the local health 
department to deliver the HPV 
vaccine in school-located vaccination 
clinics. Although HPV vaccine 
initiation rates among middle school 
girls did not reach study goals, the 
involvement of the local health 
department was key to the success of 
the school-located vaccination clinic, 
especially when the school did not 
have a health center, and the location 
of the clinic at the host school also 
increased vaccination rates. 
66 
Another collaboration between 
Denver Public Schools and Denver 
Public Health produced a school-
located vaccination program in the 
2009–2010 and 2010–2011 school 
years at 27 elementary and middle 
schools. The vaccination program 
successfully increased the proportion 
of enrolled students who received at 
least 1 dose of vaccine between the 
first and second years of the program 
(elementary school: 28%–31%; 
middle school: 12%–19%). 
67 Billing 
and reimbursement can be an 
issue in school-located vaccination 
programs, but an alternate study in 
Denver Public Schools found that 
billing is feasible, and the program 
increased the likelihood of receipt of 
Tdap, MenACWY, and HPV vaccines 
in adolescents. 
68 Another program 
in Florida similarly found that 
school-located influenza vaccination 
programs can be economically 
sustainable by targeting adequate 
numbers of privately insured 
children and reducing costs through 
volunteers and mass vaccination. 
69
 
• School nurses
School nurses who are part of 
a school health program that is 
enrolled as a Vaccines ForChildren 
program provider play an integral 
role in achieving and maintaining 
high coverage of adolescent 
immunizations. 
70 They can be 
valuable resources for delivering 
vaccines because of their knowledge 
of the school and its students, and 
access to immunization information 
systems may help increase their 
ability to provide vaccines to 
adolescent students. 
71 However, 
school nurses also hold many 
responsibilities and may not have 
the time to participate in school-
located vaccine programs because of 
competing job obligations. 
72
School Vaccination Requirements
It has been shown in the past that 
immunization requirements can help 
increase vaccination rates for some 
vaccines. 
73, 
 
74 Almost all 50 states 
have implemented immunization 
requirements for middle school 
entry, with wide variation. States 
with vaccine requirements for 
tetanus-diphtheria (Td)/Tdap and/
or MenACWY had significantly higher 
immunization rates for the respective 
vaccines compared with states with 
no vaccination requirements. 
75, 
 
76 
Importantly, school entry 
immunization requirements have 
also been shown to increase the 
immunization rates of other vaccines 
not included in the mandate. For 
example, states with school entry 
immunization requirements for Tdap 
vaccination witnessed approximately 
a 5% increase in the HPV vaccination 
rate.77 For more information, the 
CDC provides a Web site to obtain 
information on school immunization 
requirements categorized by child 
care, kindergarten, middle school, 
and college/university (http:// 
www2a. 
cdc. 
gov/ 
nip/ 
schoolsurv/ 
schImmRqmt. 
asp). The Immunization 
Action Coalition also tracks school 
requirements (http:// 
www. 
immunize. 
org/ 
laws/ 
).
The Role of AAP Chapters and the 
CDC
The CDC and the AAP, including its 
national and state chapters, have 
played active roles in helping health 
care providers boost immunization 
rates locally, regionally, and 
nationally. A recent CDC report 
highlighted that HPV immunization 
rates have increased for ≥1 or ≥3 
doses among females in 7 public 
health jurisdictions: Illinois, Chicago, 
District of Columbia, Georgia, 
Montana, North Carolina, and 
Utah. 
78 Four of these jurisdictions 
received resources in 2013 through 
the Prevention and Public Health 
Fund from the CDC to improve HPV 
vaccination coverage. In addition, the 
Advisory Committee on Immunization 
Practices’ recommendation to change 
from a 3-dose to a 2-dose series for 
persons aged 9 through 14 years 
is also expected to improve series 
completion rates. 
31 In the District of 
Columbia, school requirements for 
HPV vaccination were expanded to 
include males and females through 
12th grade. 
10 The CDC has launched 
a useful Web site for health care 
providers (http:// 
www. 
cdc. 
gov/ 
hpv/ 
hcp/ 
index. 
html), including an 
important handout entitled “Tips and 
Time-savers for Talking With Parents 
About HPV Vaccine.” The CDC recently 
released a 5-year grant, “Improving 
Immunization and Enhancing Disease 
Prevention Through Partnerships 
With Providers, 
” to improve HPV 
immunization rates. The grant uses 
the following methods: (1) providing 
outreach and training, (2) expanding 
on educational materials, and (3) 
forming strong partnerships. 
27, 
39, 
 
79 
The CDC has also developed the 
“You Are the Key” program, which 
provides a number of resources 
for providers and parents (http://

developed an HPV toolkit to educate 
other health care professionals, 
discuss HPV vaccination with 
parents, and make necessary 
changes in practice to improve 
HPV vaccination rates (https://

aspx). The National Foundation for 
Infectious Diseases has developed a 
monograph available to providers and 
has established resource pages for 
parents, adolescents, and providers 
(http:// 
www. 
adolescentvaccina 
tion. 
org). Furthermore, the CDC’s 
Assessment, Feedback, Incentives, 
and eXchange (AFIX) program is a 
quality-improvement program that 
has had significant success in boosting 
childhood immunization rates. The 
program consists of an assessment of 
vaccine coverage and formulation of 
goals for improvement. AFIX can be 
conducted via in-person consultation 
or via webinar. In a randomized 
controlled trial in North Carolina, 
AFIX improved immunization rates in 
11- through 12-year-old adolescents 
by 3 to 4 percentage points for Tdap 
vaccine, by 4 to 5 percentage points 
for meningococcal vaccine, and by 
2 percentage points for HPV vaccine 
initiation. 
80 AFIX has highlighted 
that actual immunization rates in a 
practice might not mirror clinicians’ 
perceptions of vaccine administration 
within their practice. To monitor 
immunization rates, a practice may 
periodically audit a sample of their 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS
This clinical report summarizes 
strategies to increase adolescent 
vaccination rates and addresses 
specific populations, technologies, 
and vaccination sites that are 
important in achieving this goal. 
Additional strategies to improve 
immunization rates need to be 
further explored and evaluated. 
Appropriate techniques for 
approaching adolescent patients 
and their parents in the office to 
encourage immunizations are 
important skills for health care 
providers. The key to increasing 
immunization rates and decreasing 
vaccine-preventable diseases among 
adolescents is to focus on educating 
adolescents and strengthening health 
care providers’ recommendations 
by using all clinical opportunities 
to assess immunization status and 
provide needed vaccinations.
