SUMMARY
Inhibitory interneurons regulate oscillatory rhythms and network synchrony that are required for 
cognitive functions and disrupted in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Network dysrhythmias in AD and 
multiple neuropsychiatric disorders are associated with hypofunction of Nav1.1, a voltage-gated 
sodium channel subunit predominantly expressed in interneurons. We show that Nav1.1-
overexpressing, but not wild-type, interneuron transplants derived from the embryonic medial 
ganglionic eminence (MGE) enhance behavior-dependent gamma oscillatory activity, reduce 
network hypersynchrony, and improve cognitive functions in human amyloid precursor protein 
(hAPP) transgenic mice, which simulate key aspects of AD. Increased Nav1.1 levels accelerated

 action potential kinetics of transplanted fast-spiking and non-fast-spiking interneurons. Nav1.1-
deficient interneuron transplants were sufficient to cause behavioral abnormalities in wild-type 
mice. We conclude that the efficacy of interneuron transplantation and the function of transplanted 
cells in an AD-relevant context depend on their Nav1.1 levels. Disease-specific molecular 
optimization of cell transplants may be required to ensure therapeutic benefits in different 
conditions.
ETOC BLURB
Inhibitory interneurons regulate brain rhythms and cognitive function that are disrupted in 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Martinez-Losa et al. show that the levels of voltage-gated sodium 
channel Nav1.1 subunit in interneuron transplants regulate their therapeutic efficacy in an AD 
mouse model.
INTRODUCTION
In Alzheimer’s disease (AD) causes abnormal patterns of neuronal network activity and 
cognitive decline through mechanisms that remain to be fully elucidated (Palop and Mucke, 
2010, 2016). In preclinical and early stages of AD, functional imaging during memory-
encoding tasks shows hippocampal hyperactivation and deactivation deficits in regions of the 
default mode network (Bakker et al., 2012; Dickerson et al., 2005; Sperling et al., 2009). 
The deactivation deficits correlate with early amyloid deposition and accumulation in these 
regions (Buckner et al., 2005; Sperling et al., 2009), suggesting an early pathological link 
between aberrant network activity and amyloid in AD. Aberrant network activity and 
pathologically elevated amyloid-β (Aβ) levels are also tightly linked in familial AD (FAD)-
mutant human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) transgenic mice, which develop altered 
fast- and slow-wave oscillatory activity (Busche et al., 2015; Cramer et al., 2012; Rubio et 
al., 2012; Verret et al., 2012), neuronal hyperactivity (Busche et al., 2008), activity-
dependent amyloid deposition (Bero et al., 2011; Yamamoto et al., 2015), and network 
hypersynchrony resulting in epileptiform activity that is more often non-convulsive and 
behaviorally silent than convulsive and behaviorally evident (Palop et al., 2007). Humans 
with AD, particularly with FAD, also have an increased incidence of seizures and

 epileptiform activity (for review, Palop and Mucke, 2016), and recent studies suggest that 
the prevalence of these abnormalities among sporadic AD patients may be vastly 
underestimated (Lam et al., 2017; Vossel et al., 2013; Vossel et al., 2016). Impaired 
inhibitory function could be a key mechanism of these functional abnormalities in mice and 
humans (Bakker et al., 2012; Busche et al., 2008; Busche et al., 2015; Palop and Mucke, 
2016; Sperling et al., 2009; Verret et al., 2012).
While network epileptiform activity can interfere with cognitive functions (Kleen et al., 
2013), physiological neuronal network oscillations (brain rhythms) and network synchrony 
are required for cognitive functions and are also regulated by inhibitory interneurons 
(Kepecs and Fishell, 2014; Lapray et al., 2012; Sohal et al., 2009). In humans and mice, 
increases in gamma oscillatory activity (30–80 Hz) during memory encoding predict 
effective memory formation (Matsumoto et al., 2013; Sederberg et al., 2007; Yamamoto et 
al., 2014). Gamma oscillatory activity can be enhanced by optogenetic stimulation of 
parvalbumin (PV)-positive inhibitory interneurons (PV cells) but not other cell types (Cardin 
et al., 2009; Sohal et al., 2009), indicating a causal link between PV cell function and 
gamma oscillations. In humans with epilepsy and in hAPP mice, behaviorally induced 
gamma oscillatory activity potently suppresses network hypersynchronization (Matsumoto 
et al., 2013; Verret et al., 2012). Many lines of hAPP mice, including hAPP-J20, TgCRND8, 
Tg2576, and APP/PS1 mice, have network hypersynchrony and altered gamma oscillatory 
activity (Cramer et al., 2012; Gurevicius et al., 2013; Hamm et al., 2017; Palop et al., 2007; 
Palop and Mucke, 2016; Rubio et al., 2012; Verret et al., 2012).
In humans and mice, Nav1.1 is predominantly expressed in interneurons, including PV and 
somatostatin (SOM) cells (Ogiwara et al., 2007; Rubinstein et al., 2015; Tai et al., 2014; 
Verret et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2011). Selective Nav1.1 deletion in PV and SOM cells 
impairs their excitability and action potential (AP) generation (Rubinstein et al., 2015; Tai et 
al., 2014). Hypofunction of Nav1.1 causes multiple epilepsy syndromes and autism (D'Gama 
et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2006). Nav1.1 levels are reduced in humans with AD and in multiple 
mouse models of AD, including hAPP-J20, TgCRND8, and APP/PS1 mice (Hamm et al., 
2017; Hu et al., 2017; Verret et al., 2012). Nav1.1 levels can be restored by γ-secretase 
inhibitors in TgCRND8 mice (Hamm et al., 2017). BACE1-dependent hypofunction of 
Nav1.1 has also been reported in Tg2576 and BACE1 transgenic mice (Corbett et al., 2013; 
Kim et al., 2007), which may involve enhanced cleavage of the β2-subunit of voltage-gated 
sodium channels and impaired trafficking of the α-subunits, including Nav1.1, to the cell 
membrane. Importantly, restoring Nav1.1 levels by expressing a bacterial artificial 
chromosome (BAC) enhanced gamma oscillatory activity, reduced network hypersynchrony, 
and improved cognitive performance in hAPP-J20 mice (Verret et al., 2012), suggesting an 
important functional role of Nav1.1-dependent interneuron hypofunction in the pathogenesis 
of AD-related deficits.
Interneurons and neuronal network oscillations are altered in multiple neurological and 
psychiatric disorders, including AD, epilepsy, schizophrenia, and autism (Fazzari et al., 
2010; Kepecs and Fishell, 2014; Sohal et al., 2009; Verret et al., 2012). Transplantation of 
interneuron progenitors is a potential therapeutic strategy for these conditions (Southwell et 
al., 2014). Interneuron progenitor cells can be obtained from the embryonic medial

 ganglionic eminence (MGE), the source of cortical PV and SOM interneurons (Kepecs and 
Fishell, 2014; Southwell et al., 2014). When transplanted into neonatal or adult brains, 
MGE-derived progenitor cells (MGE cells) migrate, integrate into neuronal circuits, and 
mature into functional inhibitory interneurons (Alvarez-Dolado et al., 2006; Henderson et 
al., 2014; Howard et al., 2014; Hunt et al., 2013). Hippocampal transplants of wild-type 
MGE cells improve behavioral functions in mouse models with extensive loss of 
hippocampal hilar interneurons, including pilocarpine-treated mice (Casalia et al., 2017; 
Hunt et al., 2013) and apolipoprotein E4 knock-in (apoE4-KI) mice (Tong et al., 2014), most 
likely by restoring interneuron cell numbers. However, it is unknown whether transplanted 
MGE cells can reduce hAPP/Aβ-dependent behavioral and network dysfunctions in brains 
with chronically elevated levels of Aβ in the absence of extensive interneuron loss. Here we 
demonstrate that brain transplants of wild-type, Nav1.1-overexpressing, or Nav1.1-deficient 
interneuron progenitors have very different effects on network and cognitive functions in 
hAPP-J20 and wild-type mice and suggest that molecular modification to counteract 
pathogenic contexts will likely be required to optimize the therapeutic efficacy of cell 
transplants for neurological disorders.
RESULTS
Transplanted MGE Cells Differentiate into Interneurons and Survive in hAPP-J20 Mice
We chose hAPP-J20 (J20) mice as recipients for interneuron transplants because they have 
robust cognitive deficits in the Morris water maze and fear conditioning tests, network 
hypersynchrony, reduced gamma oscillatory power, and multiple other features that 
resemble AD in humans (Palop et al., 2007; Palop et al., 2003; Palop and Mucke, 2016; 
Rubio et al., 2012; Verret et al., 2012). To identify cortical and hippocampal inhibitory 
interneurons derived from the MGE, we used BAC transgenic mice expressing green 
fluorescent protein (GFP) directed by Lhx6 regulatory sequences (Lhx6GFP mice). Lhx6GFP 
mice express GFP in embryonic MGE progenitors (Cobos et al., 2006) and in mature 
inhibitory interneurons, mainly PV and SOM cells (Figure 1A). Consistent with the 
predominant expression of Nav1.1 in inhibitory interneurons (Ogiwara et al., 2007; 
Rubinstein et al., 2015; Tai et al., 2014; Verret et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2006), 97% of cells 
with high Nav1.1 levels in Lhx6GFP mice were GFP positive (Figures 1B and 1C). Thus, 
Lhx6GFP-postive MGE-derived interneurons express Nav1.1 and mature into PV and SOM 
interneurons.
To generate interneurons with increased Nav1.1 expression (Verret et al., 2012), we bred 
Lhx6GFP and Scn1a-BAC mice to produce doubly transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type 
mouse Nav1.1 in GFP-positive interneurons (Lhx6GFPNav1.1-BAC mice). On embryonic 
day 13.5, we isolated MGE cells with wild-type Nav1.1 levels (MGEWT) from Lhx6GFP 
mice and MGE cells overexpressing Nav1.1 (MGENav1.1) from Lhx6GFPNav1.1-BAC mice. 
Nontransgenic (NTG) and J20 littermate mice received transplants of MGEWT or 
MGENav1.1 cells into cortex and hippocampus on postnatal (P) days 3–5. After 7–8 months, 
GFP-positive cells in all groups (NTGMGE–WT, J20MGE–WT, NTGMGE–Nav1.1 and 
J20MGE–Nav1.1) had mature interneuron morphology, predominately expressed the 
interneuron markers SOM (39%), PV (31%), or neuropeptide Y (7%) and displayed

 comparable and subtype-appropriate localization across cortical layers (Figures 1D–F). 
Although transplanted GFP-positive interneurons were in all cortical layers, GFP-positive 
PV cells were predominantly in intermediate cortical layers (III–V), whereas GFP-positive 
SOM cells were predominantly in superficial or deeper cortical layers (I–II or VI). Analysis 
of every tenth serial section throughout the cortex and hippocampus showed that all groups 
of mice had comparable spatial distribution and numbers of GFP-positive interneurons 
(Figures 1G and S1B). We estimate that all groups had on average 15,500–17,500 
transplanted GFP-positive interneurons per brain. Transplant-derived interneurons did not 
activate microglia or induce reactive astrocytosis in host brains (Figures S1C and S1D). 
Thus, transplanted MGE cells differentiate into interneurons and survive in J20 mice.
Low levels of cortical and hippocampal amyloid deposition were present in 100% of 7–8-
month-old J20 mice (Figure S2). To determine whether transplant-derived interneurons 
modulate early amyloid pathology in J20 mice 7–8 months after transplantation, we 
measured hippocampal Aβ-positive deposits by immunostaining with the anti-Aβ antibody 
82E1. Compared to sham-treated mice (J20SHAM), neither MGEWT nor MGENav1.1-derived 
cell transplants changed the percent area occupied by Aβ deposits or the size or number of 
deposits in the hippocampus of J20 mice (Figure S2). Hippocampal area per se was also 
unaffected by MGE transplants (Figure S2).
Nav1.1-Overexpressing, but Not Wild-Type, Interneuron Transplants Prevent and Reverse 
Behavioral Deficits in J20 Mice
To determine whether Nav1.1 expression levels in MGE cells modulate transplant efficacy in 
J20 mice, we transplanted MGEWT or MGENav1.1 cells bilaterally into the cortex and 
hippocampus of J20 and NTG littermate mice at P3–5 and analyzed the mice at 4–7 months 
of age (Figures 2A–F). Sham-transplanted littermate groups (NTGSHAM and J20SHAM) 
served as controls. Compared to NTG littermate controls, J20SHAM and J20MGE–WT mice 
displayed robust hyperactivity in the open field (Figure 2A) and Y-maze (Figure 2B) and 
excessive freezing during training in the fear-conditioning test (Figures 2C and S3), whereas 
J20MGE–Nav1.1 mice did not (Figures 2A–C and S3). Compared to J20SHAM mice, 
J20MGE–Nav1.1 mice displayed less hyperactivity and excessive freezing (Figures 2B and 
2C). Thus, MGEWT and MGENav1.1 cells likely differ in their therapeutic efficacy in the 
presence of elevated levels of hAPP/Aβ.
To determine whether early MGENav1.1 cell implantation also reduces spatial learning and 
memory deficits in J20 mice, we first tested NTGSHAM, J20SHAM, NTGMGE–Nav1.1 and 
J20MGE–Nav1.1 mice in the Morris water maze. Compared to NTGSHAM controls, J20SHAM 
mice showed markedly impaired learning in the hidden platform (spatial) component, and 
this deficit was reduced by MGENav1.1 cell transplants (Figures 2D and 2E). In the water 
maze probe trial, only J20SHAM mice failed to show a significant preference for the original 
platform location (Figure 2F). J20MGE-Nav1.1 mice had better memory retention than 
J20SHAM mice (Figure 2F). Thus, Nav1.1-enhanced interneuron transplants reduce hAPP/
Aβ-induced behavioral and cognitive deficits.
Next, we determined whether MGEWT and MGENav1.1 cell transplants can reverse 
behavioral abnormalities in adult, symptomatic J20 mice (Figures 2G–I). To ensure that all

 J20 groups had similar deficits at baseline, we tested untreated 2–3-month-old J20 and NTG 
mice in the open field (Figure 2G, trial 1). We then bilaterally transplanted MGEWT or 
MGENav1.1 cells into equally impaired J20 groups and into NTG controls and re-tested them 
at 4–7 months of age. Compared to NTG controls, J20SHAM and J20MGE–WT mice had 
robust and comparable hyperactivity and context-dependent habituation deficits in the open 
field (Figures 2G and 2H), indicating that MGEWT cells did not reduce these deficits in J20 
mice. However, these deficits were reduced in J20MGE-Nav1.1 mice as compared to J20SHAM 
controls (Figures 2G and 2H). In the water maze probe trial, J20MGE-WT, but not 
J20MGE-Nav1.1, mice failed to favor the original platform location (Figure 2I). J20MGE-Nav1.1 
mice had better memory retention than J20SHAM mice (Figure 2I).
Comparison of J20MGE-WT and J20MGE-Nav1.1 mice by ANOVA and Bonferroni tests 
(Nieuwenhuis et al., 2011) revealed that Nav1.1 overexpression in MGE cell transplants was 
required for therapeutic effects to be observed in J20 mice (Figure S4). We confirmed that 
all adult transplanted groups had similar numbers of MGEWT- and MGENav1.1-derived GFP-
positive interneurons (4,797–5,941 GFP-positive cells per brain) (Figure S4A). Thus, 
transplantation of MGENav1.1, but not MGEWT, cells into the brains of neonatal or adult J20 
mice reduced behavioral abnormalities in J20 mice, suggesting that molecular optimization 
of MGE cells is required for therapeutic benefit in brains with pathologically elevated levels 
of hAPP/Aβ.
Nav1.1-Deficient Interneuron Transplants Impair Behavioral Functions
Since reduced levels of endogenous Nav1.1 contribute to inhibitory and cognitive 
dysfunction in J20 mice (Verret et al., 2012), we tested whether reduced Nav1.1 levels in 
transplanted interneurons alter the behavior of NTG mice. MGE cells with reduced Nav1.1 
expression were obtained from heterozygous Nav1.1 knock-in mice in which one Scn1a 
allele carries a point mutation (R1407X) that introduces a premature stop codon and causes 
Nav1.1 haploinsufficiency (Ogiwara et al., 2007). MGE cells were unilaterally transplanted 
into the cortex and hippocampus at P3–5, and mice were analyzed at 6–8 months of age.
MGENav1.1–KI cell transplants impaired learning in the Morris water maze in NTG mice, as 
shown by longer escape distances and latencies and a lower percentage of trials in which the 
platform was found (Figure 3A–C). Compared to NTGMGE–Nav1.1 mice, NTGMGE–Nav1.1–KI 
mice displayed excessive freezing in a fear conditioning test (Figure 3E). Thus, 
transplantation of Nav1.1-deficient interneurons into otherwise healthy brains caused 
learning deficits and behavioral alterations, suggesting that loss of Nav1.1 changes the 
functionality of these cells in ways that actively disrupt normal brain function.
We next compared the behavioral effects of MGENav1.1 and MGENav1.1–KI cell transplants in 
J20 mice. J20MGE–Nav1.1 mice performed better than J20MGE–Nav1.1–KI mice in the Morris 
water maze, as shown by shorter escape distances and latencies and a higher percentage of 
trials in which the platform was found (Figures 3A–C). In the probe trial, J20MGE–Nav1.1 
mice, but not J20MGE–Nav1.1–KI mice, favored the original platform location (Figure 3D). 
Finally, J20MGE–Nav1.1–KI mice displayed more excessive freezing in a fear-conditioning test 
than J20MGE–Nav1.1 mice (Figure 3F). Evidently, increased Nav1.1 levels in MGE cells are

 required for therapeutic efficacy in J20 mice and reduced Nav1.1 levels in these cells cause 
behavioral deficits in NTG and J20 mice.
Nav1.1 Levels Modulate AP Kinetics and Firing Rates in Transplanted Interneurons
Increasing (MGENav1.1) or reducing (MGENav1.1-KI) Nav1.1 levels in MGE cells strongly 
modulated their effects upon transplantation into NTG and J20 mice. To explore how Nav1.1 
levels modulate intrinsic electrophysiological properties of transplanted MGE cells, we 
carried out whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of MGEWT-, MGENav1.1- and MGENav1.1–KI-
derived interneurons in acute coronal cortical slices from NTG or J20 mice 6–11 months 
after transplantations. Consistent with our histological data, we identified roughly similar 
proportions of transplant-derived fast-spiking (FS, n = 62 cells from 23 mice) and non-fast-
spiking (N-FS, n = 65 cells from 25 mice) interneurons when combining all recorded cells. 
The transplant-derived FS and N-FS interneuron subtypes displayed expected differences in 
electrophysiological properties, including AP firing rate, AP half-width, AP rise and fall 
times, resting membrane potential, input resistance and membrane time constant (Figures 4 
and S5).
To determine whether Nav1.1 levels affect AP properties, we compared transplanted 
MGENav1.1-, MGENav1.1-KI- and MGEWT-derived interneurons in NTG mice in regard to 
cell type (FS and N-FS), MGE genotype (WT, Nav1.1, and Nav1.1-KI), and the interaction 
among these variables by two-way ANOVA analyses. Importantly, Nav1.1 expression levels 
strongly modulated AP kinetics in transplant-derived FS and N-FS interneurons (Figures 4C 
and 4D). Compared to MGEWT-derived interneurons, MGENav1.1–KI-derived interneurons 
had a wider AP, slower AP rise and fall times, and a larger AP area, whereas MGENav1.1-
derived interneurons had faster AP kinetics. Thus, Nav1.1 levels potently modulated AP 
kinetics, and MGENav1.1-, MGENav1.1-KI-, and MGEWT-derived interneurons are 
functionally different, providing potential cellular mechanisms that could explain the benefit 
of molecular optimization of the transplant-derived interneurons. We confirmed that Nav1.1 
levels regulate action potential kinetics using individual cells (Figure 4C) or mice (Figure 
S6D) as the biological unit to calculate averages. Interestingly, N-FS MGENav1.1-derived 
cells displayed a distinct input-output relationship consisting of reduced AP firing at lower 
current injection intensities (0–100 pA; P = 0.020), higher proportional increases of AP 
firing rates at intermediate current intensities (100–400 pA), and similar AP firing rates at 
higher current intensities (400–500 pA). Thus, MGENav1.1-derived cells seem to be less 
responsive at low intensities and to have a better dynamic range to discriminate intermediate 
current intensities. In addition, FS MGENav1.1-KI-derived cells had slower AP firing rates in 
response to increased current injections and more pronounced AP amplitude decrement 
during sustained firing than MGEWT- and MGENav1.1-derived cells (Figures 4E and 4F). 
Consistent with these results, deletion of Nav1.1 impaired AP kinetics and firing in 
endogenous PV and SOM cells (Rubinstein et al., 2015; Tai et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2006).
To assess potential effects of the pathological altered host brain, we compared AP properties 
of transplanted FS and N-FS MGE-derived interneurons in NTG and J20 mice in regard to 
host brain genotype (NTG and J20), MGE genotype (WT and Nav1.1), and the interaction 
between them by two-way ANOVA (Figure 5A; and NTG data in Figure 4). Consistent with 
Martinez-Losa et al.

 the above results, the FS and N-FS interneurons in NTG and J20 mice displayed robust 
Nav1.1-dependent differences in AP kinetics; however, the genotype of the host brain did 
not affect the AP kinetics of transplanted MGEWT- or MGENav1.1-derived FS and N-FS 
interneurons (Figures 5B and 5C). We confirmed these results using individual cells (Figure 
5B) or mice (Figure S6E) as the biological unit to calculate averages. Comparison of 
MGEWT and MGENav1.1 cells in J20 mice by two-way ANOVA revealed that Nav1.1 
overexpression was required for accelerating AP kinetics in FS and N-FS cells in these mice 
(Figure S6). In J20 mice, MGENav1.1-derived FS cells also had increased AP firing rates at 
higher current intensities (200–500 pA) as compared to MGEWT-derived FS cells (Figures 
5D and S6). Our results indicate that Nav1.1 overexpression accelerates AP kinetics and 
increases AP firing rates of MGENav1.1-derived FS interneurons in J20 mice.
Nav1.1-Overexpressing, but Not Wild-Type, Interneuron Transplants Counteract Network 
Hypersynchrony in J20 Mice
Humans with AD, particularly early-onset and familial AD, and hAPP transgenic mice are 
prone to network hypersynchrony and altered gamma oscillatory activity (Noebels, 2011; 
Palop and Mucke, 2016; Vossel et al., 2016). To determine whether interneuron transplants 
suppress hAPP/Aβ-induced network hypersynchrony, we transplanted MGEWT or 
MGENav1.1 cells bilaterally into the hippocampus and cortex of 2–3-month-old mice and 
analyzed the mice at 7–8 months of age. We monitored spontaneous epileptiform discharges 
(spikes/min) by intracranial EEG recordings and locomotor activity (movements; beam 
breaks/min) for 50 min while mice explored a novel environment. MGENav1.1 cell 
transplants reduced hyperactivity (Figure 6A) and spike frequency (Figure 6B) in J20 mice.
The firing rates of PV-positive interneurons and gamma oscillatory power increase during 
exploratory activity (Kemere et al., 2013; Lapray et al., 2012). Consistent with this behavior-
dependent modulation of network function, spike rates in J20 mice increased as they 
habituated to the novel environment and their exploratory activity decreased, most markedly 
in J20SHAM mice (Figure 6C). Movements and spike rates in J20 mice were inversely related 
(Figure 6D). Spike rates were highest at rest (0–9 beam breaks/min), intermediate during 
low exploratory activity (10–49 beam breaks/min), and lowest during high exploratory 
activity (50–150 beam breaks/min) (Figure 6E). Spike rates were lower in J20MGE–Nav1.1 
mice than J20SHAM mice (Figure 6E). To determine whether Nav1.1 expression in MGE 
cells is required for therapeutic effects in J20 mice, we compared J20SHAM, J20MGE-WT, and 
J20MGE-Nav1.1 mice. Consistent with our behavioral data (Figures 2 and S4), MGENav1.1, but 
not MGEWT, cells reduced epileptiform activity in J20 mice (Figures 6F and 6G). Thus, 
Nav1.1 enhancement of MGE cells is required for these transplants to suppress hAPP/Aβ-
induced hypersynchrony.
Reduced Behavioral Activity–Associated Increases in Gamma Oscillations Predict 
Locomotor Hyperactivity in J20 Mice
Gamma oscillatory power in cortical networks increases during sensory or cognitive tasks in 
humans and mice; the increases predict better memory formation (Matsumoto et al., 2013; 
Sederberg et al., 2007; Yamamoto et al., 2014) and are associated with reduced rates of 
epileptiform spikes in humans and mice with network hypersynchrony (Matsumoto et al., 
Martinez-Losa et al.

 2013; Verret et al., 2012). To determine whether behavior-dependent modulation of gamma 
oscillations and epileptiform spikes in J20 mice relate to their hyperactivity and habituation 
deficits, we studied the relationship between gamma oscillatory power, epileptiform spike 
rate, and locomotor activity at 1-min intervals in J20SHAM and J20MGE–Nav1.1 mice. 
Consistent with previous findings (Rubio et al., 2012; Verret et al., 2012), J20SHAM mice 
had reduced gamma power (Figure S7). Gamma power, which is predominantly regulated by 
PV cells (Cardin et al., 2009; Sohal et al., 2009), was closely related to exploratory activity 
(Figures 7A–C) (Kemere et al., 2013; Lapray et al., 2012). Linear regression analysis 
revealed strong positive correlations between exploratory activity and gamma power (Figure 
7C). Obtaining data at 1-min intervals allowed us to accurately calculate the slope of the 
linear regression between exploratory activity and gamma power (relative to resting) for 
each mouse. Thus, the slope reflects the modulation of gamma power during exploratory 
activity. J20SHAM and J20MGE–Nav1.1 mice with less behavior-dependent modulation of 
gamma power (flatter slopes) had higher levels of exploratory activity (Figure 7D, top) and 
took longer to habituate (Figure 7D, bottom). Total epileptic activity did not correlated with 
these behavioral alterations in J20 mice (data not shown; P = 0.668, J20SHAM; P = 0.5569, 
J20MGE-Nav1.1). These results suggest that the extent of behavior-dependent modulation of 
gamma oscillatory activity predicts behavioral performance and that reduced modulation is 
closely related to hyperactivity and habituation deficits in hAPP mice.
Nav1.1-Overexpressing Interneuron Transplants Enhance Behavior-Dependent Modulation 
of Gamma Oscillations
Gamma oscillations aberrantly increase during seizures or hypersynchronized network 
activity in epilepsy models (Howard et al., 2014). MGE cell transplants reduce these gamma 
oscillation increases (Howard et al., 2014) and network hypersychrony, including seizures 
(Baraban et al., 2009; Casalia et al., 2017; Hammad et al., 2015; Henderson et al., 2014; 
Hunt et al., 2013). However, it is unknown whether MGE cell transplants can enhance 
normal fluctuations of gamma oscillatory activity during memory encoding (Matsumoto et 
al., 2013; Sederberg et al., 2007; Yamamoto et al., 2014). To determine whether MGE cell 
transplants increase behavior-dependent modulation of gamma oscillations, J20 mice were 
sham-treated or transplanted with MGENav1.1 or MGEWT cells at 2–3 months of age and 
tested at 4–7 months. Compared to MGESHAM, MGENav1.1 but not MGEWT cell transplants 
enhanced the increases of gamma power during exploratory activity (Figure 8A), which 
predict better behavioral performance in J20 mice (Figure 7). J20MGE-Nav1.1 mice had higher 
increases in gamma power than J20SHAM mice (Figure 8A). Despite the electrophysiological 
deficits in MGENav1.1–KI-derived FS and N-FS interneurons (Figure 4) and the behavioral 
abnormalities these cells caused in NTG mice (Figure 3), we were unable to detect 
epileptiform discharges or altered gamma oscillations in NTGMGE–Nav1.1–KI mice (data not 
shown).
Periods of reduced gamma power tend to be associated with increased rates of epileptiform 
discharges in humans and mice with network hypersynchrony (Matsumoto et al., 2013; 
Verret et al., 2012). However, it is unclear whether these phenomena are causally related 
and, if so, whether epileptiform discharges cause (and therefore precede) reductions in 
gamma power, or vice versa. To address this issue, we calculated the gamma power before

 and after each epileptiform discharge in J20 mice. Gamma power decreased abruptly before 
the discharges, reached the lowest level during the discharges, and rapidly recovered after 
the discharges (Figure 8B). Thus, decreased gamma power precedes epileptiform discharges, 
suggesting that the drop in gamma power is causally linked to the emergence of these events. 
Interestingly, only MGENav1.1 cells prevented the drop in gamma power before epileptiform 
discharges in J20 mice (Figure 8C), suggesting that the drop is caused by interneuron 
impairment and can be prevented by Nav1.1-overexpressing interneuron transplants.
DISCUSSION
This study shows that transplantation of Nav1.1-overexpressing MGE-derived interneurons 
into brains of a mouse model simulating key aspects of AD enhances behavior-dependent 
modulation of gamma oscillatory activity, reduces network hypersynchrony, and improves 
cognitive functions. Wild-type interneuron transplants failed to restore brain functions, 
indicating that the therapeutic effects of the transplanted cells depend on Nav1.1 levels. 
Moreover, transplantation of Nav1.1-deficient interneurons in NTG mice induced learning 
deficits and behavioral abnormalities, indicating that Nav1.1 levels in interneurons critically 
impact cognitive functions. Thus, Nav1.1 deficiency confers an adverse gain of function on 
interneurons, whereas Nav1.1 overexpression enhances their normal activities beyond a 
critical threshold or confers a beneficial gain of function. At the cellular level, increased 
Nav1.1 levels accelerated AP kinetics, whereas decreased Nav1.1 levels slowed AP kinetics 
in transplant-derived FS and N-FS interneurons in NTG mice. In J20 mice, enhanced Nav1.1 
levels in MGENav1.1-derived FS interneurons accelerated AP kinetics and increased AP 
firing rates. Our findings highlight key differences among MGEWT, MGENav1.1-, and 
MGENav1.1–KI-derived interneurons, the functional relevance of Nav1.1 levels in transplant-
derived interneurons, the potential of Nav1.1 and interneurons as a therapeutic target in AD, 
and the value of molecularly modifying brain cell transplants to enhance their functions.
We identified three main cellular and network mechanisms that may underlie the beneficial 
effects of interneuron transplants, all of which depended on Nav1.1 levels. MGENav1.1, but 
not MGEWT, cell transplants accelerated AP kinetics, enhanced behavior-dependent 
increases in gamma oscillatory activity, and reduced network hypersynchrony in hAPP-J20 
mice.
Increased Nav1.1 Levels Accelerate AP Kinetics in Transplanted Interneurons
Nav1.1 deficiency in endogenous inhibitory interneurons slows AP kinetics, including AP 
half-width, and reduces AP firing rates in a gene dose-dependent manner (Rubinstein et al., 
2015; Tai et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2006). We observed similar AP deficits in transplanted 
MGENav1.1-KI-derived interneurons, confirming the functional relevance of Nav1.1 levels in 
inhibitory cells. Nav1.1 overexpression accelerated AP kinetics (spike waveforms) in 
transplant-derived FS and N-FS interneurons in NTG and hAPP-J20 mice and increased AP 
firing rates in MGENav1.1-derived FS interneurons in hAPP-J20 mice. Faster AP kinetics and 
higher firing rates in MGENav1.1-derived FS interneurons of J20 mice may have several 
functional benefits, including incomplete sodium channel inactivation during repetitive 
firing, which enables high-frequency firing in fast-spiking interneurons, resistance to

 frequency-dependent AP broadening during repetitive firing, and enhanced gamma 
oscillations (Bean, 2007; Carter and Bean, 2009). Our data suggest that faster AP kinetics 
and higher AP firing rates are the key cellular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects 
of MGENav1.1-derived interneurons in J20 mice.
MGENav1.1 Cell Transplants Enhance Behavior-Dependent Gamma Oscillations and 
Cognitive Functions
Since increasing the AP firing rate of PV cells promotes gamma oscillatory activity (Cardin 
et al., 2009; Sohal et al., 2009), the improvement of gamma oscillations in MGENav1.1-
transplanted hAPP-J20 mice likely reflects increased activity or synchrony of transplant-
derived PV cells. Indeed, MGENav1.1-derived FS interneurons had higher firing rates than 
MGEWT-derived FS interneurons in hAPP-J20 mice. It is tempting to speculate that these 
increased firing rates contributed to the enhanced gamma power in J20MGE-Nav1.1 mice. 
Importantly, increases in gamma oscillatory activity during cognitive tasks predict effective 
memory formation in humans and mice (Matsumoto et al., 2013; Sederberg et al., 2007; 
Yamamoto et al., 2014). Consistent with these findings, reduced behavior-dependent 
modulation of gamma oscillations predicted habituation deficits and hyperactivity in hAPP-
J20 mice. The inability of these mice to enhance gamma oscillatory activity during 
exploration of a novel environment may contribute to their learning and memory deficits. 
Indeed, MGENav1.1-derived interneuron transplants increased the behavior-dependent 
modulation of gamma oscillation and improved cognitive functions.
MGENav1.1 cell transplants also reduced excessive freezing in hAPP-J20 mice during the 
learning and recall phases of a fear-conditioning test. Excessive freezing was also seen in 
NTGMGE-Nav1.1-KI mice without detectable epileptic activity, indicating that dysfunction of a 
small proportion of interneurons is sufficient to cause this behavioral abnormality. 
Consistent with our results, optogenetic inhibition of PV cells causes excessive fear-like 
responses in mice without seizures (Courtin et al., 2014).
Interestingly, MGENav1.1 cells transplanted into J20 mice had beneficial effects on 
behavioral and network functions despite the Nav1.1 hypofunction of endogenous 
interneurons in these mice. Yet, MGENav1.1-KI cells transplanted into NTG mice had 
detrimental effects on behavioral functions. These results indicate that relatively small 
numbers of transplanted MGE cells with modified Nav1.1 function can exert dominant 
positive as well as dominant negative effects. In principle, these opposing effects could be 
caused by modulation of the same or distinct cellular and network mechanisms, including 
complex interactions between transplanted and endogenous neurons.
Network Hypersynchrony and Gamma Oscillations in Mice and Humans
Reduced gamma oscillatory activity seems to be mechanistically linked to network 
hypersynchrony in hAPP-J20 mice (Verret et al., 2012) and in humans with epilepsy 
(Matsumoto et al., 2013). Notably, gamma power dropped abruptly seconds before 
epileptiform discharges, and reached the lowest level during the discharges. Thus, reduced 
gamma power may be mechanistically linked to the generation of epileptiform discharges, at 
least in hAPP-J20 mice. In humans with epilepsy, memory encoding is associated with 
Martinez-Losa et al.

 increased gamma oscillations and reduced epileptiform discharges (Matsumoto et al., 2013). 
Thus, enhancing gamma oscillations by therapeutic interventions may reduce network 
hypersynchrony. Indeed, MGENav1.1-transplanted hAPP-J20 mice had increased behavior-
dependent gamma oscillatory activity and reduced network hypersynchrony, implicating 
Nav1.1-deficient inhibitory interneurons and impaired gamma oscillations as potential 
pathogenic drivers.
Interneuron Transplant Efficacy and Disease-Specific Molecular Optimization
MGEWT-derived interneurons did not reduce network and cognitive dysfunctions in hAPP-
J20 mice, whereas they did in human apoE4-KI/hAPP-J20 mice (Tong et al., 2014) and 
pilocarpine-treated nontransgenic mice (Casalia et al., 2017; Hunt et al., 2013). Several 
mechanisms may account for the greater efficacy of MGEWT cells in these disease models. 
First, behavioral phenotypes in apoE4-KI/hAPP-J20 mice largely depend on apoE4, as 
soluble Aβ levels and amyloid deposition are reduced by >75–80% in APP mice that lacked 
mouse apoE (Bales et al., 1999; Bien-Ly et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2011). Second, pilocarpine-
treated (Casalia et al., 2017; Hunt et al., 2013) and apoE4-KI mice with or without hAPP 
expression (Tong et al., 2014) have severe loss of hippocampal interneurons, particularly of 
SOM cells in the hilus of the dentate gyrus. Thus, hippocampal MGE transplants may 
primarily serve to replace the lost interneurons. In hAPP-J20 mice, however, interneurons, 
particularly PV cells in the parietal cortex, are not depleted but become dysfunctional as a 
result of Nav1.1 depletion (Verret et al., 2012). Thus, disease-specific molecular 
optimization of cell transplants might be required to achieve therapeutic benefits in some 
circumstances but not others.
Translational Opportunities for Brain Cell Transplants
Great caution needs to be applied when trying to extrapolate from animal models to human 
diseases. Bearing this caveat in mind, we find it promising that transplantation of human 
MGENav1.1 cells into the brains of symptomatic adult J20 mice reduced cognitive deficits 
and behavioral alterations, even though it did not change the early amyloid pathology. 
Because the long-term efficacy and safety of anti-Aβ treatments remains uncertain 
(Cummings et al., 2017), it is important to explore alternative and complementary strategies 
to counteract effects that mediate AD-related network dysfunction and cognitive decline. 
Based on the data presented here and others reviewed elsewhere (Palop and Mucke, 2016), 
we consider the dysfunction of interneurons and the hypofunction of Nav1.1 worthy targets 
in this regard.
Notably, interneuron dysfunction and abnormal oscillatory network activities are associated 
not only with AD, but also with autism, schizophrenia, and other cognitive disorders 
(Fazzari et al., 2010; Kepecs and Fishell, 2014; Sohal et al., 2009; Verret et al., 2012). 
Interneuron transplantation strategies might be beneficial in several of these disorders 
(Southwell et al., 2014). Rapid advances in cell reprogramming approaches may enable the 
generation of human cells that closely resemble MGE-derived interneuron precursors before 
long (Cunningham et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2013). Our findings suggest that for these cells to 
reach their maximal therapeutic potential, they may need to be further engineered to adapt 
their biological activities to the pathological environment into which they are transplanted.

• EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
◦ 
◦ Mice—We studied heterozygous transgenic mice expressing human amyloid precursor 
protein (hAPP) with the Swedish and Indiana FAD mutations (line J20) and nontransgenic 
(NTG) littermate controls (Mucke et al., 2000). F1 offspring from crosses between male J20 
C57BL/6J mice and female NTG FVB/N mice were analyzed. To identify inhibitory 
interneurons derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), we used BAC transgenic 
FVB/N mice expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) directed by Lhx6 
regulatory sequences (Lhx6GFP mice) (Cobos et al., 2006). To increase Nav1.1 expression 
levels by ~25% (Verret et al., 2012), we used Scn1a-BAC transgenic FVB/N mice from line 
1 overexpressing wildtype murine Nav1.1 (Nav1.1-BAC mice) (Tang et al., 2009). To reduce 
Nav1.1 expression levels, we used Nav1.1 knock-in mice carrying a premature stop codon 
point mutation of the mouse Scn1a gene (Nav1.1-R1407X mice) (Ogiwara et al., 2007). 
Unless indicated otherwise, measurements were done in sex-balanced groups by 
investigators who were unaware of the genotype and treatment of the mice. Mice had free 
access to food (Picolab Rodent Diet 20; LabDiet, St Louis, MO) and water and were 
maintained on a regular light/dark (12 hours on/12 hours off) cycle. For harvesting of brain 
tissue, mice were deeply anesthetized and flush-perfused transcardially with saline. Brains 
were drop-fixed in 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde for 24–48 h. All experiments 
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of 
California, San Francisco.
• METHOD DETAILS
◦ 
◦ MGE Transplants—At embryonic (E) day 13.5, brains from Lhx6GFP, Lhx6GFP/
Nav1.1-BAC, or Lhx6GFP/Nav1.1-R1407X FVB/N mice were placed in ice-cold L-15 
medium, and the ventricular and subventricular zones of the anterior part of the MGE were 
dissected as described (Alvarez-Dolado et al., 2006; Zipancic et al., 2010) to isolate 
MGEWT, MGENav1.1, or MGENav1.1–KI, respectively. To generate MGEWT cells, we crossed 
homozygous Lhx6GFP+/+ males with wild-type females to produce Lhx6GFP+/− embryos. To 
generate MGENav1.1 cells, we crossed Lhx6GFP+/+Nav1.1-BAC+/− males with 
Lhx6GFP+/+Nav1.1-BAC+/− females to produce Lhx6GFP+/+, Lhx6GFP+/+/Nav1.1-BAC+/− 
and Lhx6GFP+/+/Nav1.1-BAC+/+ embryos. Among 189 offspring from independent 
breedings between Nav1.1-BAC+/− males and Nav1.1-BAC+/− females 70.4% were Nav1.1-
BAC positive, suggesting that such crosses yield both heterozygous and homozygous 
Nav1.1-BAC transgenic mice. To generate MGENav1.1-KI cells, we crossed Nav1.1-R1407X
+/− males with Lhx6GFP+/+ females to produce Lhx6GFP+/−Nav1.1-R1407X+/+ and 
Lhx6GFP+/−Nav1.1-R1407X+/− embryos. Embryonic MGEs from 2–3 litters (~10–20 
embryos) were dissected, pooled, and transplanted into 10–20 mice. Thus, MGENav1.1 and 
MGENav1.1–KI precursors likely contained ~70% and ~50% cells with increased (Nav1.1-
BAC+/− or Nav1.1-BAC+/+) or decreased (Nav1.1-R1407X+/−) Nav1.1 expression,

 respectively. For the electrophysiological experiments, embryonic MGEs from individual 
embryos were dissected and transplanted into 1–2 mice. The rest of the brain post MGE 
dissection was collected from each embryo and genotyped for flag-Nav1.1 or Nav1.1-KI to 
identify MGE cell genotypes.
At E13.5, the density of MGE embryonic interneuron progenitors is at its peak, and the 
MGE is clearly delineated by a sulcus from the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE). Tissue 
explants were collected in 1 ml of L-15 medium containing DNase I (10–100 µg/ml) and 
mechanically dissociated by repeated pipetting through a 200-µl plastic tip. MGE cell 
number and viability (~80%) were determined by trypan blue exclusion. The cells were 
pelleted by centrifugation (2 min, 800 × g) and resuspended in L-15 medium at 0.1–0.5×106 
cells/µl. MGE cell suspensions were front-loaded into beveled glass micropipettes (~60–
150-µm tip diameter) prefilled with pure mineral oil and then with L-15 medium. A 
microinjector and stereotaxic frame were used to deliver a total of 0.5–1.0×106 MGE cells 
per mouse distributed bilaterally across 14 (adults) or 8 (neonatal) cortical and hippocampal 
sites (50–100 nl per site) through four injection sites. Stereotaxic coordinates for adults 
were: anterior injection sites A −0.7 from the bregma, L ±2.4, D 1.8, 1.4, and 1.0 (from the 
skull surface); posterior injection sites A −1.7 from the bregma, L±1.4, D 2.0, 1.4, 0.8, and 
0.5 (from the skull surface). For neonates, anterior injection sites A −3.0 from the naison at a 
30° angle, L ±2.8, D 2.0 and 1.5 (from the skull surface); posterior injection sites A −4.5 
from the naison at a 30° angle, L ±3.0, D 3.0 and 1.5 (from the skull surface). For Figure 3, 
neonatal NTG and J20 mice received unilateral transplants of MGENav1.1 and MGENav1.1–KI 
cells into the cortex and hippocampus.
For stereotaxic injections, adult mice were anesthetized with avertin (tribromoethanol, 250 
mg/kg) and neonates by hypothermia induced by placement on ice until the pedal reflex was 
abolished. MGEWT or MGENav1.1 cells were transplanted into the hippocampus and cortex 
of neonatal (P3–5) or 2–3-month-old NTG or J20 mice to generate NTGMGE-WT, 
J20MGE-WT, NTGMGE-Nav1.1 and J20MGE-Nav1 mice. Sham-transplanted groups (NTGSHAM 
and J20SHAM) received the same treatment, but the L-15 medium contained no MGE cells.
◦ 
◦ Immunohistochemistry—Tissue preparation and immunohistochemistry were done as 
described (Palop et al., 2011). After fixation, brains were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in 
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 2 days and sectioned with a sliding microtome (Leica 
Microsystems) into 30-µm sections. Ten stereological subseries sections from each 
hemibrain were stored in a solution containing 30% glycerol, 30% ethylene glycol, and 40% 
PBS at −20°C until staining. Primary antibodies used included rabbit anti-GFP (1:3,000; 
Life Technologies), chicken anti-GFP (1:500; Aves Labs), rabbit anti-Nav1.1 (1:500; 
Alomone), mouse anti-parvalbumin (1:3,000; Swant), rabbit anti-parvalbumin (1:3,000; 
Swant), rat anti-somatostatin (1:50; Novus), rabbit anti-neuropeptide Y (1:2000; 
Immunostar), rabbit anti-Iba-1 (1:1000; Wako), rabbit anti-GFAP (1:3000; Sigma), and 
biotinylated 82E1 (1:1000; Immuno-Biological Laboratories). Primary antibodies were 
detected with biotinylated donkey anti-rabbit (1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch), Alexa 
Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit (1:300; Life Technologies), Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-
chicken (1:300; Life Technologies), Alexa Fluor 594 donkey anti-rat (1:300; Life

 Technologies), Alexa Fluor 594 donkey anti-mouse (1:300; Life Technologies), or Alexa 
Fluor 594 donkey anti-rabbit (1:300; Life Technologies).
◦ 
◦ Histological Quantifications—In Lhx6GFP BAC transgenic mice, GFP expression is 
directed by the interneuron-specific Lhx6 regulatory sequences, and GFP is specifically 
expressed in embryonic MGE progenitors and in mature inhibitory interneurons derived 
from them (Cobos et al., 2006). All GFP-positive cells were counted in every tenth serial 
coronal 30-µm section (300µm apart) throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the cortex and 
hippocampus of one hemibrain per mouse. On average, we analyzed 14.92 ± 0.22 sections 
per mouse. A total of 31,529 GFP-positive cells were counted in 6–15 mice per group; from 
these counts, we estimated the total number of GFP-positive cells per brain. To identify 
MGE-derived interneuron subtypes, sections were double-labeled by fluorescence 
immunohistochemistry for GFP (green) and for PV, SOM, or NPY (red). Images were 
captured with an Axiocam HRc camera and Zen Lite 2012 software (Carl Zeiss) mounted on 
a fluorescence microscope (Olympus Bx41) at 40× magnification. A total of 1,449 GFP-
positive cells (n = 4 mice per group) were analyzed, including PV cells (n = 186/568 GFP-
positive cells), SOM (n = 186/487 GFP-positive cells), and NPY (n = 26/394 GFP-positive 
cells). For quantification of glia activation, brain sections were double-labeled by 
fluorescence immunohistochemistry for transplanted GFP-positive MGE-derived 
interneurons (green) and for Iba-1-positive microglia or GFAP-positive astrocytes (red). All 
images were captured at 20× magnification using the same image acquisition settings with 
the Keyence BioRevo BZ-9000 microscope and BZ-II Viewer and Analyzer software. To 
determine glia activation, transplanted GFP-positive MGE-derived interneurons were 
identified and the fluorescence intensity of Iba-1 or GFAP staining surrounding the 
transplanted cells or baseline intensity away from the cells were quantified using ImageJ. A 
total of 80 square blocks of area surrounding transplanted cells and 80 blocks of baseline 
fluorescence were quantified for microglia and astrocytes respectively (n = 3-4 mice per 
group).
◦ 
◦ Whole-Cell Recordings—Mice (aged 8–9 months) were anesthetized with avertin 
(tribromoethanol, 250 mg/kg) and perfused with ice-cold dissection solution containing (in 
mM): 93 NMDG, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 30 NaHCO3, 20 HEPES, 25 glucose, 5 ascorbic 
acid, 2 thiourea, 3 sodium pyruvate, 12 N-acetyl-L-cysteine, 10 MgSO4, and 0.5 CaCl2, pH 
7.3. Brains were removed and maintained in ice-cold dissection solution for acute slice 
preparation. Coronal 300-µm-thick slices were prepared using a vibratome and transferred to 
a recovery chamber for 10 min containing dissection solution warmed to 35°C. Slices were 
then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in a modified artificial cerebral spinal fluid 
(ACSF) containing (in mM): 92 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 30 NaHCO3, 20 HEPES, 25 
glucose, 5 ascorbic acid, 2 thiourea, 3 sodium pyruvate, 12 N-acetyl-L-cysteine, 2 MgSO4, 
and 2 CaCl2, pH 7.3. Until recordings were performed, the slices were maintained in 
oxygenated standard ACSF containing (in mM): 119 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1 NaH2PO4, 26.2 
NaHCO3, 11 glucose, 1.3 MgSO4, and 2.5 CaCl2.
Slices were transferred to a recording chamber and continuously perfused with standard 
ACSF at 32°C. Transplanted GFP-expressing interneurons were identified by

 epifluorescence and infrared differential interference contrast on an upright microscope 
(BX51WIF, Olympus). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were done with internal solution 
containing (in mM): 135 K-gluconate, 10 HEPES, 0.1 EGTA, 5 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 4 Mg-ATP, 
0.3 Na-GTP, pH 7.3. Patch pipette resistance was 3–5 MΩ. Picrotoxin (100 µM), CNQX (10 
µM), and D-AP5 (100 µM) were added to the ACSF to block synaptic inputs. Recordings 
were obtained with a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices), digitized at 10 kHz, 
and acquired with WinLTP software (version 1.11b, University of Bristol). Access resistance 
was continuously monitored throughout the recordings and any neuron with >20 MΩ or 
>20% change in access resistance was excluded from the analysis. The liquid junction 
potential was not corrected. Resting membrane potential was determined upon initiating 
whole-cell configuration. In current clamp mode, neurons were held at −60 mV, and current 
was injected in incremental steps of 1-sec duration. Current steps ranged from −60 to 500 
pA (−60, −40, −20, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 pA). The AP waveform 
kinetics were analyzed by the AP width at half maximum height, the 10–90% rise time, and 
the 90–10% fall time from the first AP in response to a 1-s current injection at 500 pA. The 
AP area (ms*mV) was the integral of the of the first AP waveform in response to a 1-s 
current injection at 500 pA. Maximum AP #/1s at 20–500 pA was the maximum number of 
APs in response to a 1-s current injection at any current intensity (20–500 pA). AP threshold 
was defined as the voltage of the action potential where dV/dt first exceeded 15 mV/ms. The 
initial AP rate at 500 pA was calculated from the intervals between the initial 10 APs in 
response to a 1-s current injection at 500 pA. Membrane time constant was estimated from 
the best fit of a single exponential to the initial hyperpolarization during a −60 pA current 
step. Spike amplitude was calculated as the voltage difference between the resting 
membrane potential and the peak of the first evoked AP. Recordings were analyzed with 
pClamp 10.4 (Axon Instruments). Experiments and analysis were done blind to mouse and 
MGE cell genotype. FS and N-FS cells were defined by their intrinsic properties, mainly the 
maximum number of APs in response to a 1-s current injection, the AP half-width and the 
resting membrane potential (Figure S5A–C). From the 130 cells recorded, we excluded 3 
cells that we could not properly classify since they had mixed N-FS and FS properties.

◦ Behavioral Tests
Morris water maze: The water maze pool (122-cm diameter) contained opaque white water 
with a 12×12-cm platform submerged 1.5 cm below the surface. For spatial training 
sessions, mice were trained to locate the hidden platform during 5 or 6 consecutive days. 
Each day, mice received two training sessions 4 h apart consisting of two 60-s trials 10 min 
apart. The hidden platform location remained constant and the entry points were changed 
semirandomly between trials. Four hours after the last training session, the platform was 
removed and a 60-s probe trial was done (Verret et al., 2012). Performance was monitored 
with an EthoVision video tracking system (Noldus Information Technology). Distance swum 
or time to reach the hidden platform was used to measure performance in the training phase. 
For the probe trial, we measured the number of times mice crossed the original platform 
location plus 6 cm around it (target location) or the equivalent positions in the other three 
quadrants (other locations).

 Open field behavior: Exploratory locomotor activity was measured in four identical clear 
plastic open-field chambers (40 × 40 × 30 cm) with two 16 × 16-photobeam arrays to detect 
horizontal and vertical movements (automated Flex-Field/Open Field Photobeam Activity 
System). Mice were placed in one of the chambers for 5 min per session. Total horizontal 
movements (beam breaks), both fine and ambulatory, were recorded. For the habituation 
studies, each mouse was always retested in the same chamber. The apparatus was cleaned 
with 70% ethanol between trials.
Y-maze: The Y-maze consisted of three 70-cm arms. The mouse was placed in one of the 
arms and was allowed to move freely for 6 min. The total distance travelled was measured. 
Performance was monitored with the EthoVision video-tracking system.
Contextual fear conditioning test: Fear conditioning was performed in four identical 
computer-controlled chambers (28 × 21 × 22 cm) (Med Associates). The floor of each 
chamber had 18 stainless steel rods (4-mm diameter, 1.5 cm apart) connected to a shock 
scrambler and generator, which, together with internal ventilation fans, supplied background 
noise of 70 dB. For the training session (day 1), after 5-min exposure to the chamber (to 
record baseline freezing), mice were given four 2-sec shocks (0.45 mA) 2 min apart. For the 
24-h context testing, mice were placed in the same chamber for 5 min. Freezing behavior, 
defined as the absence of any visible movement except that required for respiration, was 
automatically recorded by a video-tracking system (motion threshold = 18, detection method 
= linear; Med Associates). The chambers were cleaned with 70% ethanol after each mouse. 
Mice were singly housed three days before and during the water maze testing but not for the 
other tests.
◦ 
◦ Recordings of EEG and Locomotor Activity Levels—Mice were implanted for 
video EEG monitoring after anesthesia with intraperitoneal avertin (tribromoethanol, 250 
mg/kg) as described (Verret et al., 2012). Teflon-coated silver wire electrodes (0.125-mm 
diameter) soldered to a multichannel electrical connector were implanted into the subdural 
space over the left frontal cortex (1 mm lateral and anterior to the bregma) and the left and 
right parietal cortex (2 mm lateral and posterior to the bregma). The left frontal cortex 
electrode was used as a reference. All EEG recordings were done out at least 10 days after 
surgery on freely moving mice in an open-field chamber (40 × 40 × 30 cm) during the 
middle part of the daylight cycle. Exploratory locomotor activity (beam breaks/min) was 
measured with an automated Flex-Field/Open Field Photobeam Activity System (San Diego 
Instruments). Total movements included fine and ambulatory horizontal movements and 
vertical movements. Movement frequencies were defined as follow: resting (0–9 beam 
breaks/min or ~0–5 cm/min), low (10–49 beam breaks/min or ~5–35 cm/min), and high (50–
150 beam breaks/min or ~35–110 cm/min). EEG activity was recorded with Harmonie 
software at 200 Hz sampling rate (version 5.0b, Stellate) for 50 min.
To determine the time to habituate to NTG control level in the open field (Figure 7C), we 
calculated the y-intercept at 40 beam breaks/min (habituated basal activity) for each mouse 
by linear regression analyses, using the 50-min data points of movement frequency (x; beam 
breaks/min) and time (y; min). The number of sharp-wave discharges (spikes) was 
automatically detected with a Gotman spike detector (threshold 6; Harmonie, Stellate) or 
Martinez-Losa et al.

 with a custom-made algorithm and LabChart 7 Pro software (AD Instruments). Spikes 
recorded from left and right hemibrains were added and shown as epileptiform spikes/min.
For spectral analyses, 50-min segments of unfiltered EEG recordings (sampling rate 200 sec
−1) from freely moving mice were imported and analyzed using LabChart 7 Pro software 
(AD Instruments). The 30–90-Hz band was used to calculate gamma power, and a 58–62-Hz 
notch filter was applied to remove potential electrical noise. To obtain spectral power, we 
subjected the recordings to a fast Fourier transform (FFT) with a Hann cosine-bell window 
with 50% overlap between windows of 500-ms epochs. FFT was done with a 512 point FFT 
size to obtain a resolution of 0.39 Hz. The total signal amplitude or power in V2 in each 500-
ms epoch was taken to represent the magnitude of gamma oscillatory power. The gamma 
power values for each 500-ms epoch were further averaged over 60 sec of EEG recording, 
using the median values, to remove potential noise. Finally, signals from both hemibrains 
were averaged to obtain the gamma power values for each mouse.
To calculate relative gamma power, the y-intercept at 0 movements/min was calculated for 
each mouse by linear regression analyses using the 50-min data points of movement 
frequency (x; beam breaks/min) and the absolute gamma power (y; V2) (Figures 7 and 8). 
The y-intercept of the absolute gamma power value was used to normalize the 50 min of 
EEG data points of gamma power within each mouse, therefore, it was defined as 1.0 
(gamma power relative to resting). For calculation of gamma power before spikes (Figure 8), 
the gamma power for each 100-ms epoch was calculated for the 50 min of EEG recordings 
for each mouse as described above. Spikes for each 100-ms epoch and epochs to the next 
spike were calculated. Power spectrum data (Figure 6) was extracted using Spike2 software 
version 8 with FFT size 1024 (resolution 0.1953) and Hanning window function. NTG and 
J20 mice were matched based on locomotor activity to avoid locomotor activity-dependent 
effects on power.
• AVOIDANCE OF BIAS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
◦ 
◦ Blindcoding and Randomization—Investigators who carried out measurements were 
blinded with respect to the genotype of mice and the nature of the transplants they had 
received. Mice of the same genotype were randomly assigned to receive different types of 
transplants.
◦ 
◦ Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were done with STATA 11.2 or Prism 6.0. 
Graphs were generated with Prism 6.0. As indicated in the figure legends, differences among 
multiple means were assessed by one-way or two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc 
tests. The P values of the Bonferroni tests are indicated in the figure panels with the 
following significance levels, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001. Two-way ANOVA P 
values for the factors and interactions are indicated in the figure legends. Number (n) of 
mice or cells for all statistical analyses is indicated in each graph or in the legend. Learning 
curves in the Morris water maze, fear-conditioning, and novel-environment, open-field tests 
were analyzed by repeated-measures ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc tests. Linear 
regression analyses were used to calculate slopes or y-intercept and to determine significant 
differences among groups. Null hypotheses were rejected at the 0.05 level.

 Figure 2. MGENav1.1 cell transplants reduce behavioral and cognitive deficits in J20 mice
Mice received bilateral transplants at P3–5 (A–F) or at 2–3 months of age (G–I) and were 
tested at 4–7 months.
(A–F) P3–5 MGENav1.1, but not MGEWT, transplants reduced behavioral alterations in J20 
mice, including hyperactivity in the open field (A) and Y-maze (B) and enhanced freezing in 
the fear-conditioning test (C). MGENav1.1 cells improved performance in the hidden 
platform (spatial) component (D and E) and the probe trial (F) of the Morris water maze 
test. n = 8–10 mice per group. See Figure S3 for the learning curves of the same groups of 
mice in the fear-conditioning test.
(G) Open-field activity before (trial 1) and after MGE cell transplantation (trials 2–4).

per J20 group.
(H) Open-field activity in trial 2.
(I) MGENav1.1, but not MGEWT, cells increased platform location preference in the water 
maze probe trial.
