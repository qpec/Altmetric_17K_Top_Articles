Abstract
Despite the success of monotherapies based on blockade of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) in 
human melanoma, most patients do not experience durable clinical benefit. Pre-existing T-cell 
infiltration and/or the presence of PD-L1 in tumours may be used as indicators of clinical 
response; however, blood-based profiling to understand the mechanisms of PD-1 blockade has not 
been widely explored. Here we use immune profiling of peripheral blood from patients with stage 
IV melanoma before and after treatment with the PD-1-targeting antibody pembrolizumab and 
identify pharmacodynamic changes in circulating exhausted-phenotype CD8 T cells (Tex cells). 
Most of the patients demonstrated an immunological response to pembrolizumab. Clinical failure 
in many patients was not solely due to an inability to induce immune reinvigoration, but rather 
resulted from an imbalance between T-cell reinvigoration and tumour burden. The magnitude of 
reinvigoration of circulating Tex cells determined in relation to pretreatment tumour burden 
correlated with clinical response. By focused profiling of a mechanistically relevant circulating T-
cell subpopulation calibrated to pretreatment disease burden, we identify a clinically accessible 
potential on-treatment predictor of response to PD-1 blockade.
CD8 T cells can mount responses against many human cancer types, especially those with 
higher mutational burden1. Indeed, pre-existing T-cell infiltration can be a positive 
prognostic indicator in a variety of cancers2. Moreover, PD-L1 expression in tumours is, in 
some cases, associated with T-cell responses3,4. However, these CD8 T-cell responses often 
fail to eradicate tumours, and cells can become dysfunctional or exhausted5. Tex cells have 
weak (though not absent) effector function and undergo an altered pattern of differentiation

 compared to effector (Teff) and memory (Tmem) CD8 T cells. Tex cells are also actively 
restrained by inhibitory receptors, including PD-1 (ref. 5). Blocking the PD-1 pathway can 
partially reinvigorate Tex cells in pre-clinical models6 and has led to positive clinical 
responses in a number of human cancers, including melanoma7. However, despite the 
success of PD-1-based monotherapies in human melanoma, the majority of patients do not 
have durable clinical benefit7. A major remaining challenge is identifying which patients 
will respond to anti-PD-1 therapy and defining the reasons for success versus failure of the 
treatment. Some pretreatment predictors of response to PD-1 blockade have been reported, 
such as the presence of T cells in the tumour and/or PD-L1 expression in biopsies3,4, but 
these predictors remain suboptimal. In addition, it has been unclear whether peripheral blood 
profiling can be used to detect responses to checkpoint blockade, identify the relevant 
responding cell types and allow insights into the underlying immunological mechanisms of 
on-going clinical response.
Healthy donor versus melanoma patients
We enrolled 29 patients with stage IV melanoma treated with the anti-PD-1 antibody 
pembrolizumab (pembro). All patients had previously received anti-CTLA-4 therapy 
(Extended Data Fig. 1). Patients were treated with pembro, and blood was obtained before 
therapy and every 3 weeks during therapy for a total of 12 weeks. 62% of patients did not 
have an objective clinical response, determined on the basis of immune RECIST (response 
evaluation criteria in solid tumours) criteria, consistent with published trials8,9 (Fig. 1a, 
Extended Data Fig. 1).
Peripheral blood T cells from patients with melanoma were first compared to those from 
age-matched healthy donors using high-dimensional flow cytometry. The frequencies of 
CD4 and CD8 T cells, memory T-cell subsets, and CD4 and CD8 T-cell co-expression of 
inhibitory receptors (PD-1, CTLA-4, 2B4, and TIM-3) were similar (data not shown). 
However, patients with melanoma had a higher frequency of CD4+FOXP3+ T cells and Ki67 
expression by FOXP3+ cells (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Ki67 expression was also increased in 
CD8 T cells from patients with melanoma (P < 0.0001, Extended Data Fig. 2b), 
predominantly in the PD-1+ CD8 T-cell subset (P < 0.0001, Extended Data Fig. 2c), 
suggesting a pre-existing immune response.
Pharmacodynamic immune response to anti-PD-1
Ki67 is a marker of cellular proliferation and T-cell reinvigoration in mouse models upon 
checkpoint blockade10, as well as in humans receiving anti-CTLA-4 treatment plus 
radiation11. Thus, we examined changes in Ki67 expression in more detail. Indeed, the 
frequency of Ki67+ CD8 T cells was increased at 3 weeks after pembro treatment and then 
declined in most patients (Fig. 1b). The responding Ki67+ CD8 T-cell population was largely 
CD45RAloCD27hi and contained cells with high expression of CTLA-4, 2B4, and PD-1 
(Fig. 1c) (using an anti-IgG4 detection approach12, see Methods and Extended Data Fig. 3a). 
Moreover, the responding Ki67+ cells were Eomeshi and T-betlo (P <0.0001, Fig. 1c), 
consistent with the phenotype of Tex cells10,13. In contrast, the Ki67+ population in healthy 
donors was largely EomeshiT-bethi and CD27lo, consistent with an effector phenotype

 (Extended Data Fig. 3b, c). In addition to CD8 T cells, Ki67 increased in FOXP3− CD4 T 
cells and FOXP3+ CD4 T cells following pembro treatment, mainly in the PD-1+ subset of 
each population (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Neither FOXP3− nor FOXP3+ CD4 T-cell 
responses correlated with clinical outcome (Extended Data Fig. 2e, f).
The increase in Ki67 expression was most prominent in the PD-1+ versus PD-1− CD8 T 
cells (P < 0.0001; Fig. 1d). Moreover, this Ki67 response in the PD-1+ subset peaked at 3 
weeks after treatment compared to the PD-1− subset (P < 0.0001, Fig. 1e). The time since 
last dose of anti-CTLA-4 therapy did not correlate with subsequent post-pembro Ki67 levels 
or treatment response (Extended Data Fig. 4a–c), suggesting that the immunologic response 
observed in this instance was mainly due to anti-PD-1 therapy. In healthy donors, Ki67 
expression by PD-1+ CD8 T cells varied little over 3 weeks, changing 1.1-fold ±0.37 
(Extended Data Fig. 3d). In contrast, the majority of patients with melanoma (20 out of 27) 
had a biologically meaningful increase in Ki67 in their PD-1+ CD8 T cells after treatment 
(Fig. 1f, Extended Data Fig. 1). Despite this 74% immunologic response rate, only 38% 
achieved a clinical response, indicating that not all patients with an immunologic response to 
pembro have clinical benefit.
Reinvigorated Tex cells detected in peripheral blood
We next assessed whether CD8 T cells that co-expressed PD-1 and other inhibitory receptors 
provided greater precision in tracking the pharmacodynamic effects of PD-1 blockade. 
Circulating populations of PD-1+CTLA-4+ CD8 T cells were largely EomeshiT-betlo and 
CD45RAloCD27hi (Fig. 2a). Furthermore, around 50% of PD-1+CTLA-4+ cells expressed 
Ki67 before treatment, consistent with data on Tex cells in mice13, and this increased to 
around 75% after treatment (Fig. 2b, c). There was substantially lower Ki67 expression in 
the PD-1+CTLA-4− T cells (Fig. 2c). Addition of a third inhibitory receptor (for example, 
2B4) or focusing on the recently described PD-1+CXCR5+TCF-1+ subset14,15 further 
enriched for cells responding to anti-PD-1 therapy (Fig. 2c, Extended Data Fig. 5). 
Moreover, IFNγ-producing PD-1+CTLA-4+ and PD-1+CXCR5+ subsets increased after 
anti-PD-1 therapy, consistent with reinvigoration of Tex cells (Extended Data Fig. 5g).
To characterize further the pembro-reactive T cells, we used mass cytometry (CyTOF) and 
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). For CyTOF, we used high-dimensional visualization and 
unsupervised clustering. PD-1 is known to be expressed not only by Tex cells, but also 
effector, effector memory and central memory CD8 T cells16,17. Indeed, memory (CCR7hi) 
and effector (CD27lo) populations were among PD-1-expressing CD8 T cells (Extended 
Data Fig. 6a). However, a third population, expressing markers of exhaustion (for example, 
Eomes, CD39 (ref. 18); Fig. 2d, Extended Data Fig. 6e, f) was also identified that increased 
in frequency and Ki67 expression after anti-PD-1 therapy (Extended Data Fig. 6b–d). This 
population of circulating Tex cells had low expression of granzyme B and perforin but high 
granzyme A and K, before and after anti-PD-1 therapy (Fig. 2e–g). RNA-seq from total CD8 
T cells identified few transcripts that robustly changed following treatment (Extended Data 
Fig. 7a, b). However, focusing on genes with altered expression following the same pattern 
as Ki67 in bulk CD8 T cells revealed transcriptional changes consistent with Tex cells 
(Extended Data Fig. 7c, d, Supplementary Table 1). These analyses identified increased

 expression of CTLA4, HAVCR2 (encoding TIM-3), HLA-DRB1 and CD38, and changes in 
pathways including proliferation, metabolism, CD28 co-stimulation, and JNK signalling. 
Moreover, the set of top 50 positive gene correlates of Ki67 was highly enriched for a 
signature of Tex cells reinvigorated by PD-1 blockade previously obtained in the LCMV 
system in mice19 (Fig. 2h). Together, these data identified a circulating population with a 
Tex-cell phenotype in the blood and revealed changes in this population following anti-PD-1 
therapy, consistent with reinvigoration of Tex cells.
Responding T-cell clones from blood found in tumour
Both neoantigen- and shared-antigen-specific T cells have been identified in the circulating 
PD-1+ CD8 T-cell population20. Moreover, there is clonal overlap between these cells in the 
blood and tumour-infiltrating T cells20. To explore these relationships following anti-PD-1 
therapy, CD8 T cells from the blood were sorted at the peak of Ki67 expression after 
treatment from three responders and three non-responders, and the T-cell receptor (TCR) 
repertoire was compared to pretreatment tumour-infiltrating T cells. Many of the top 10 
tumour-infiltrating T-cell clones were readily identifiable in the blood and after therapy, 
including the two most abundant clones by frequency in all cases, regardless of clinical 
response (Fig. 3a, b, Extended Data Fig. 8a, Supplementary Table 2).
We then determined whether these shared clones were present in the population responding 
to anti-PD-1 therapy. To avoid permeabilization, responding cells were sorted using 
expression of HLA-DR and CD38 (ref. 21), rather than Ki67. Approximately 80% (mean, 
80.1%) of the HLA-DR+CD38+ CD8 T cells expressed Ki67, and these HLA-DR+CD38+ 
cells responded with similar kinetics as Ki67+ CD8 T cells (Extended Data Fig. 8b–d). 
RNA-seq identified HLA-DRB1 and CD38 among the top 50 correlates of Ki67 
(Supplementary Table 1) and these HLA-DR+CD38+ cells were enriched for markers of Tex 
cells (Extended Data Fig. 8e, f). Across six patients, 14 clones were present among the top 
10 clones in both the tumour and blood (Fig. 3b). All of these (14 out of 14) were HLA-
DR+CD38+ in the blood (Fig. 3b). Extending to the top 100 clones, 18 out of 19 clones 
shared between blood and tumour were HLA-DR+CD38+, whereas a mixture of activated 
and resting phenotype was found for clones that were only found in the blood and not 
tumour (Fig. 3c). These observations support the notion that Ki67+ (HLA-DR+CD38+) Tex 
cells in the blood are reinvigorated by anti-PD-1 therapy and contain T-cell clones that are 
also present in the tumour.
T-cell reinvigoration correlates with tumour burden
Antigen burden is a key determinant of the severity of exhaustion and reinvigoration of Tex 
cells by PD-1 therapy in preclinical models10,22. To test this idea in patients with melanoma, 
we developed a practical approach to estimate antigen burden using all measurable tumour 
lesions on the pretreatment imaging scan (tumour burden, see Methods). Indeed, higher 
tumour burden was associated with more Ki67+ CD8 T cells both before and after therapy 
(Fig. 3d). Random forest modelling of 39 immune parameters at 3 weeks showed that Ki67+ 
CD8 T cells were the strongest correlate of tumour burden (Fig. 3e, Supplementary Table 3). 
This correlation was also detectable before treatment, but became stronger after treatment

 (Fig. 3f), suggesting a pre-existing CD8 T-cell response related to tumour burden, 
augmented by anti-PD-1 therapy.
Reinvigoration/tumour ratio affects clinical outcome
It was possible that larger baseline immune responses would correlate with clinical response. 
However, higher pretreatment Ki67 levels in PD-1+ CD8 T cells were in fact an indicator of 
poor prognosis (Fig. 4a, top). A larger immune response before treatment may reflect higher 
tumour burden that itself is a poor prognostic indicator (Fig. 4a, bottom). Indeed patients 
who progressed on anti-PD-1 therapy had evidence of systemic inflammation at baseline 
(Fig. 4b, c). Random forest analysis showed that Ki67 alone did not correlate with clinical 
outcome (data not shown). We therefore hypothesized that it was not the absolute magnitude 
of reinvigoration that mattered, but rather that the ratio of Tex-cell reinvigoration to tumour 
burden might better predict clinical response. To test this, we examined clinical responses in 
relation to the fold change of PD-1+Ki67+ CD8 T cells after anti-PD-1 therapy, adjusted for 
baseline tumour burden. Patients with longer progression-free survival (PFS) generally had a 
low tumour burden and clustered above the fold change of PD-1+Ki67+ CD8 T cells to 
tumour-burden regression line, suggesting that the ratio of Tex-cell reinvigoration to tumour 
burden may be associated with clinical outcome (Extended Data Fig. 9a). Moreover, instead 
of fold change that required measurements both before and after treatment, a higher ratio of 
Ki67+ CD8 T cells to tumour burden at the post-treatment peak T-cell-response time point 
was associated with better clinical outcomes. Responders clustered above the PD-1+Ki67+ 
cell to tumour-burden regression line, whereas non-responders largely fell below (Extended 
Data Fig. 9b). Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis identified a Ki67 to 
tumour burden ratio of 1.94 that segregated patients by clinical outcomes as early as 6 weeks 
into therapy. A Ki67 to tumour burden ratio greater than 1.94 at 6 weeks was associated with 
better outcome by objective response rate, PFS and overall survival (Fig. 4d, Extended Data 
Fig. 9c). Moreover, by CyTOF, the three patients with clinical benefit (complete response, 
partial response, and stable disease) showed expansion of Tex cells, whereas the patient who 
progressed showed an expansion of Teff cells (Extended Data Fig. 6g, h), supporting the idea 
that reinvigoration of Tex cells is important.
Other variables were examined by multivariate regression modelling (Extended Data Fig. 
9d), implicating additional roles for BRAF status that may be related to tumour-infiltrating 
lymphocytes upon BRAF inhibition23,24 and lactate dehydrogenase, a potential circulating 
proxy for tumour burden (Extended Data Fig. 9e–g) and known negative-prognostic 
indicator in stage IV melanoma25. Moreover, data from a subset of patients also suggested a 
role for PD-L1 expression in the tumour and mutational burden, consistent with published 
observations3,4,26 (data not shown). Thus, extending this modelling to include other 
variables will be important in the future.
A second independent cohort of patients with advanced melanoma that was treated with 
pembro was analysed. Flow cytometry was performed on the CD8 T cells from a subset of 
patients involved in clinical trial NCT01295827 (Extended Data Fig. 1). Data from this 
cohort confirmed preferential reinvigoration of PD-1+ and PD-1+CTLA-4+ CD8 T cells after 
pembro treatment (Fig. 4e, f). These analyses also demonstrated that a Ki67 to tumour

 burden ratio of 1.94 was associated with overall survival by 6 weeks after treatment (Fig. 
4g). These key observations in an independently recruited and analysed cohort support the 
idea that the relationship between reinvigorated CD8 T cells in the blood and overall tumour 
burden correlates with clinical outcome.
Discussion
Here we report several findings relevant to the understanding of response to PD-1 blockade 
in patients with advanced melanoma. First, most patients have an on-target immunological 
effect of PD-1 blockade on CD8 T cells and this effect can be detected, longitudinally 
monitored and mechanistically interrogated in the peripheral blood. Second, we identified 
Tex cells as a major target of PD-1 blockade in most patients with melanoma, allowing us to 
develop a ‘reinvigoration score’ by relating changes in circulating Tex cells to tumour 
burden. Third, most patients have a single peak of PD-1-blockade-induced immune 
reinvigoration, despite on-going treatment. Fourth, these responding Tex cells in the blood 
contain TCR clonotypes shared with tumour-infiltrating T cells. Finally, we identify that the 
ratio of Tex-cell reinvigoration to tumour burden can distinguish clinical outcomes and 
predict response. The relationship between Tex-cell reinvigoration and tumour burden 
suggests a ‘calibration’ of immune responses to antigen burden and raises the possibility that 
even robust reinvigoration by anti-PD-1 therapy may be clinically ineffective if the tumour 
burden is high. On the basis of these observations, it may be possible to delineate classes of 
predicted therapeutic failures (Extended Data Fig. 10). Tumour burden alone is not a perfect 
predictor of response to anti-PD-1 therapy and it has been challenging to define on-treatment 
predictive markers. An on-treatment biomarker is not only valuable in helping to define 
clinical responses as early as possible, but also in informing the type of immunological 
failure and tailor subsequent therapies. It is likely that other parameters such as anatomical 
location of metastases, PD-L1 expression and mutational phenotype will add further 
resolution to this relationship between T-cell reinvigoration and tumour burden. 
Recognizing, on the basis of tumour burden, that the amount of reinvigoration induced by 
PD-1 blockade in a given patient may be inadequate allows for early clinical intervention, 
for example with additional immune or targeted therapies27,28. It will be important to test if 
the approaches reported here can be extended to other, especially less immunogenic, tumour 
types. However, the current study not only illustrates the on-target pharmacodynamic 
immune effect of PD-1 blockade and utility of blood-based immune monitoring, but also 
identifies a potential novel predictive biomarker and a framework for future mechanistic 
dissection by revealing the relationship between overall tumour burden and magnitude of 
immune reinvigoration by PD-1 blockade.

 METHODS
Data reporting
No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not 
randomized and the investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and 
outcome assessment.
Patients and specimen collection
Patients with stage IV melanoma were enrolled for treatment with pembrolizumab (2 mg 
kg−1 by infusion every 3 weeks) under an Expanded Access Program at Penn (http://
clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT02083484) or on NCT01295827 at Memorial Sloan 
Kettering Cancer Center (‘MSKCC’). Patients consented for blood collection under the 
University of Pennsylvania Abramson Cancer Center’s (‘Penn’) melanoma research program 
tissue collection protocol UPCC 08607 and under protocol 00-144 at MSKCC, in 
accordance with the Institutional Review Boards of both institutions. Peripheral blood was 
obtained in sodium heparin tubes before treatment and before each pembro infusion every 3 
weeks for 12 weeks. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated using ficoll 
gradient and stored using standard protocols.
Assessment of response and tumour burden
Tumour burden—Total measurable tumour burden was defined as the sum of the long axis 
of all measurable lesions reported on the pre-therapy imaging reports. Patients with only 
non-measurable lesions or active brain metastasis were excluded from analysis involving 
clinical response and tumour burden. Assessment of clinical response and tumour burden 
was performed independently in a blinded fashion.
Clinical response, Penn cohort—Clinical response to anti-PD-1 therapy for the Penn 
cohort was determined as best response based on immune related RECIST (irRECIST) using 
unidimensional measurements29. In addition, the following modifications were used. (1) 
Lymph node lesions with a short axis between 10 and 15 mm with a standard uptake value 
(SUV) of greater than 5 on PET scan were included as measurable lesions. (2) Lesions 
greater than 5 mm confirmed to be melanoma by biopsy were included as measurable 
lesions.
Clinical response, MSKCC cohort—Clinical response for the MSKCC cohort was 
assessed based on immune-related response criteria30 using bidimensional measurements at 
the 12 week time point.
Flow cytometry
Penn cohort—Cryopreserved PBMC samples from pretreatment, cycles 1–4 (weeks 3–12) 
were thawed and stained with master mix of antibodies for surface stains including CD4 
(Biolegend, OKT4), CD8 (ebioscience, RPA-T8), 2B4 (Beckman Coulter, IM2658), 
CD45RA (Biolegend, HI100), TIM-3 (F38-2E2), LAG-3 (Enzo, ALX-804-806B-C100), 
CXCR5-BV421 (BD, RF8B2) and CD27 (BD, L128) and intracellular stains for FOXP3 
(BD, 259D/C7), CTLA-4 (BD, BNI3), Eomes (ebioscience, WD1928), T-bet (Biolegend,

 4B10), GzmB (Life Tech, GB11), TCF-1-AlexaFluor647 (Biolegend, 7F11A10) and Ki67 
(BD, B56). Permeabilization was performed using the FOXP3 Fixation/Permeabilization 
Concentrate and Diluent kit (eBioscience). PD-1 on post pembro specimens was detected 
using anti-human IgG4 PE (Southern Biotec). Pretreatment samples were pretreated with 25 
μg ml−1 pembro in vitro for 30 min at 37 °C, washed twice and stained with standard 
antibody mix. Cells were resuspended in 1% paraformaldehyde until acquisition on a BD 
Biosciences LSR II cytometer and analysed using FlowJo (Tree Star).
MSKCC cohort—PBMC samples at the indicated visits pre- and post-pembrolizumab 
treatment were thawed and stained with a fixable Aqua viability dye (Invitrogen) and a 
cocktail of antibodies to the following surface markers: CD8–Qdot605 (Invitrogen, 3B5), 
CD4–Qdot655 (Invitrogen, S3.5), PD-1–PE (BD, MIH4), LAG-3–FITC (Enzo, 17B4), 
ICOS–PE-Cy7 (eBioscience, ISA-3), TIM-3–APC (R&D Systems, 344823). Cells were next 
fixed and permeabilized with the FOXP3/Ki67 Fixation/Permeabilization Concentrate and 
Diluent (eBioscience), and subsequently stained intracellularly with CD3–BV570 
(Biolegend, UCHT1), Ki67–AlexaFluor700 (BD), FOXP3-eFluor450 (eBioscience), and 
CTLA-4–PerCP–eFluor710 (eBioscience). Stained cells were acquired on a BD Biosciences 
LSRFortessa and analysed using FlowJo software (FlowJo, LLC).
Cell sorting
Cryopreserved PBMC samples were thawed and stained as per flow cytometry protocol 
(above). For RNA sequencing experiments, total CD8 T cells were sorted, using a dump/
dead-CD3+CD8+ gating strategy. For TCR sequencing experiments, CD8 T cells were gated 
as above, and CD38+HLA-DR+ and cells that were not CD38+HLA-DR+ (that is, 
CD38−HLA-DR−, CD38+HLA-DR−, and CD38−HLA-DR+) were sorted. Cell sorting was 
performed on BD Aria Sorter.
Cytokine analysis
Concentration of circulating plasma cytokines was analysed using Luminex technology 
(EMD Millipore).
Stimulation with PMA and ionomycin
Thawed cells were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma) at 0.25 
μg ml−1 and ionomycin (Sigma) at 2.5 μg ml−1 for 2–5 h in 37 °C and stained. Cytokine 
production was analysed with intracellular staining using antibodies to IFNγ (Biolegend, 
B27) and TNF-α (Biolegend, Mab11).
Random forest for classification and regression
Random forest regression and classification (RF–RC) is a multivariable non-parametric 
ensemble partitioning tree method that can be used to model the effect of all interactions 
between genes and proteins as predictors on a response variable31. Each model is 
constructed using approximately two-thirds of randomly selected samples and cross-
validated on the one-third of the samples left out of the model building process (‘out-of-bag’ 
samples). After many iterations, results of all models are averaged to provide unbiased

 estimates of predicted values, error rates, and measures of variable importance. Performance 
of an RF–RC model is measured by the mean square error for regression and by 
misclassification error rate for classification. Flow cytometry subsets were used as possible 
predictors of clinical response variables. For each predictor, an importance score is 
determined, that measures the contribution of the variable to the error rate (higher scores are 
more predictive). We used the ‘randomForest’ R package version 4.6–12 implementation 
and the following parameters: 5,000 trees, node size of 1, mtry value (that is, number of 
variables available for splitting at each node) equal to the square root of the number of 
variables in the model, and the Breiman–Cutler permutation method for importance score 
determination. The mean decrease in accuracy is used as the importance score measure.
Mass cytometry and CyTOF analysis
Mass cytometry reagents were obtained from Fluidigm or generated by conjugation of 
unlabelled mAbs to isotope-loaded polymers per the MAXPAR kit instruction (Fluidigm). 
Single-cell suspensions were pelleted, and incubated with 20 μM Lanthanum-139 (Trace 
Sciences)-loaded maleimido-mono-amine-DOTA (Macrocyclics) in PBS and incubated for 
10 min at room temperature for live/dead discrimination. Cells were washed in staining 
buffer and resuspended in surface antibody cocktail, incubated for 30 min at room 
temperature, washed twice in staining buffer, fixed, and permeabilized using FOXP3 
staining buffer set (eBioscience), and stained intracellularly for 60 min at room temperature. 
Cells were further washed twice before fixation in 1.6% PFA (Electron Microscopy 
Sciences) solution containing 125 nM iridium overnight at 4 °C. Before data acquisition on 
CyTOF2 (Fluidigm), cells were washed twice in PBS and once in dH2O. Data analysis was 
performed with FlowJo v10 (TreeStar) and SPADE (Cytobank) as outlined previously32. 
Analysis of fold change frequency was performed using the ‘percenttotalratiolog’ parameter 
for SPADE that performs the calculation log10[percentage of total (week 3)/(percentage of 
total (pretreatment)]. Summary statistics for Tex, Tmem, and Teff cells were calculated as the 
median fold change or mass intensity of each cluster by taking into account the proportion 
contributed by each node. R package ‘pheatmap’ was used for creating heat maps.
T-cell receptor sequencing
Manual macrodissection was performed on FFPE slides, if necessary, using a scalpel and a 
slide stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) as a guide. Tissue deparaffinization and 
DNA extraction were performed using standard methods. DNA was quantified using Qubit 
dsDNA BR Assay (Invitrogen). Peripheral blood CD8 T cells were purified and isolated 
from PBMCs using BD Aria Sorter. DNA extraction, amplification, library preparation, 
sequencing, and preliminary bioinformatics analysis was performed by Adaptive 
Biotechnologies. Amplification and sequencing of TCRB CDR3 was performed at a survey 
level resolution using the immunoSEQ Platform (Adaptive Biotechnologies).
Immunohistochemistry for PD-L1 and CD8, and analysis
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumours were collected at the time of surgical resection 
or from a biopsy. For anti-PD-L1 staining, after heat-induced antigen retrieval (Bond ER2, 
20 min), the tumour slides were stained with an anti-PD-L1 antibody (E1L3N, Cell 
Signaling) at 1:50 dilution. To confirm specificity, the anti-PD-L1 antibody was validated by

 staining Hodgkin’s lymphoma cells and placenta. For anti-CD8 staining, after heat-induced 
antigen retrieval (Bond ER1, 20 min), the tumour slides were stained with an anti-CD8 
antibody (M7103, Dako) at 1:40 dilution. Tumour infiltrating CD8-positive T cells was 
scored as absent, minimal, mild, moderate and brisk by a blinded expert melanoma 
pathologist. Tumour-infiltrating CD8 T cells were also analysed by image recognition 
analysis using ImageJ2. Digital slides were acquired by a Leica microscope. RGB stack 
images of CD8 staining were converted to greyscale, and particles (positive stain) counted 
using a threshold value of 100 with a size between 10 and 625 μm2. Total area of the tumour 
was calculated using a tumour mask.
RNA sequencing and analysis
After sorting, the cells were resuspended and frozen in RLT buffer (Qiagen). RNA was 
isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy micro kit (74034) according to the manufacturer’s 
protocol. RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit 
for Pico Input Mammalian from Clonetech according to the manufacturer’s protocol 
(635007). The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq machine using a 300-cycle 
high-output flow cell (15057929), with a read depth between 9 million and 20.6 million 
paired mapped reads. The Fastq files were aligned using STAR 2.5.2a and hg19. The aligned 
files were processed using PORT gene-based normalization (https://github.com/itmat/
Normalization). The differential gene expression was performed with Limma. Limma-voom 
was used to identify significantly different transcripts between groups using P value <0.05. 
For patients with a Ki67 peak at cycle 1 (three patients), the top 40 genes highly correlated 
with MKI67 were taken to create a correlative network including the top 5 genes correlating 
with the MKI67-correlated genes. The final network had nodes with highly correlated 
(absolutely value of the correlation coefficient >0.7 (abs(corr) > 0.7)) values with MKI67. 
Cytoscape 3.4.0 was used for creation of correlation network, and metascape.org was used to 
enrich genes for GO biological processes. The data discussed in this publication have been 
deposited in NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO Series 
accession number GSE96578 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?
acc=GSE96578).
Whole-exome sequencing, mutational burden analysis and neoepitope prediction
Manual macrodissection was performed on FFPE slides, if necessary, using a scalpel and 
H&E-stained slide as a guide. Tissue deparaffinization and DNA extraction were performed 
using standard methods. DNA was quantified using Qubit dsDNA BR Assay (Invitrogen). 
DNA libraries were created using NEBNext Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New 
England BioLabs) and targets were captured with SureSelect Human All Exon V6 + 
COSMIC (Agilent). HLA type was determined with OptiType and neoepitope predictions 
were made using NetMHCcons 1.1 Server.
Statistical methods and classification and regression tree (CART) analysis
For group comparisons and correlation analyses, testing was performed using PRISM 6.0. 
Normality of distributions was assessed using D’Agostino–Pearson omnibus normality test 
and variance between groups of data was assessed using the F-test. For normally distributed 
data, significance of mean differences was determined using two-sided paired or unpaired

 Student’s t-tests, and for groups that differed in variance, unpaired t-test with Welch’s 
correction was used. For non-normal data, non-parametric Mann–Whitney U-tests or 
Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank tests were used for unpaired and paired analyses, 
respectively. Descriptive statistics included mean, median, standard deviation and range for 
continuous variables and frequency and proportion for categorical variables. Correlations 
between continuous variables were determined by Pearson’s r coefficient, whereas 
correlations between ordinal-scaled categorical variables were determined by Spearman’s r 
coefficient. Overall survival was defined from the initiation of treatment to date of death or 
last patient contact alive and estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method. Landmark overall 
survival and PFS analysis was defined as overall survival and PFS starting from 6 weeks 
after therapy. To visually inspect the relationships between Ki67 (week 6 maximum), 
baseline tumour burden and clinical outcomes, we constructed simple scatter plots of Ki67 
by baseline tumour burden and employed colour-coded symbols for clinical outcome such as 
overall survival, PFS, and clinical response. In general, the mean was used for 
dichotomization of clinical outcomes. This included PFS and landmark PFS in the Penn 
dataset (Extended Data Fig. 4, Extended Data Fig. 9) and landmark overall survival for 
MSKCC dataset (Fig. 4g). In the Penn dataset, landmark overall survival was dichotomized 
using a cutoff of 9.5 months, as it represented the longest complete survival time (that is, no 
patient with LOS <9.5 months was alive and censored for survival) (Fig. 4d, Extended Data 
Fig. 9). The log rank test was employed to compare overall survival between patient 
subgroups. The ratio of Ki67 to tumour burden was associated with overall survival and was 
further examined by CART analysis. CART identified the optimal cut point to split this 
continuous variable into two homogenous subgroups according to overall survival. By this 
method, the optimal cut point is selected from all possible cut points. Survival and CART 
statistical analyses were performed using either IBM SPSS v23 or STATA v14. Similar 
analysis was performed for landmark PFS.
Model selection, principal component analysis and Fisher’s exact calculation
Model selection is a method of selecting models among a set of candidate models. The R 
package ‘leaps’ version 2.9 with parameters ‘nvmax = 3’, and ‘nbest =10’ was used to select 
the ten best models on the basis of linear regression for predicting CD8 and Ki67 expression.
Clinical parameters were used as predictor variables and Ki67 as the dependent variable. 
This method evaluates all one-variable, two-variable, and three-variable models and ranks 
best-fitting models using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), penalized by number of 
variables. Lower BIC score signals a better model.
Principle component analysis was used to visualize three variables: tumour burden, Ki67, 
and mutational burden in two-dimensional space. R package factoMiner was used to 
calculate and extract the percentage of variance explained by principal components and the 
variables contained in each PCA variable.
Fisher’s exact test was used to test the hypothesis that the probability of finding shared TCR 
CDR3 clonotypes (between top 10 tumour-infiltrating T-cell clones and peripheral blood, 
Fig. 3a) among all unique sequenced peripheral blood clones was different than the 
probability of finding a clone in the tumour by random chance, with an theoretical estimate

(stable disease + progressive disease). b, Ki67 expression in CD8 T cells at indicated times 
(n = 29). c, Expression of the indicated markers in Ki67+ (green) and Ki67− (blue) CD8 T 
cells at 3 weeks (n =27). d, Ki67 expression in PD-1+ (red) and PD-1− (blue) CD8 T cells at 
3 weeks (n =27). e, Ki67 expression in PD-1+ (red) and PD-1− (blue) CD8 T cells at 
indicated times (n =29). f, Fold change of Ki67 expression at peak of immunologic response 
versus pretreatment. Dotted line denotes fold change of 2.21, which is the mean plus 3 s.d. 
in healthy donors (see Extended Data Fig. 3d). *P <0.05, ***P <0.001, ****P < 0.0001, 
Wilcoxon matched-pairs test. Error bars, s.d. Flow cytometry data in all panels are 
representative of 1–4 independent technical replicates of the stain indicated.
