Abstract
Importance: While congenital malformations and genetic diseases are a leading cause of early 
infant death, the contribution of single-gene disorders in this group is undetermined.
Objective: To determine the diagnostic yield and utility of clinical exome sequencing in critically 
ill infants.
Design, setting, participants: Clinical exome sequencing was performed on 278 unrelated 
infants within the first 100 days of life, admitted to Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston, over a 
period of five years, between December 2011 and January 2017. Exome sequencing types 
included proband exome, trio exome, and critical trio exome, a rapid genomic assay for seriously-
ill infants.
Main outcomes and measures: Indications for testing, diagnostic yield of clinical exome 
sequencing, turnaround time, molecular findings, patient age at diagnosis, and impact on medical 
management in a group of critically ill infants suspected to have genetic disorders.
Results: Clinical indications for exome sequencing included a wide range of medical concerns. 
Overall, molecular diagnosis was achieved in 102/278 infants by clinical exome sequencing with a 
diagnostic yield of 36.7%. The diagnosis affected medical management in 53/102 (52.0%) of 
infants, with substantial impact on informed redirection of care, initiation of new subspecialist

 care, medication/dietary modifications, and furthering life-saving procedures in select patients. 
Critical trio exome revealed a molecular diagnosis in 32/63 infants (50.8%) at 33.1±5.6 days of 
life with turnaround time (TAT) of 13.0 ± 0.4 days. Clinical care was altered by the diagnosis in 
23/32 (71.9%) patients. The diagnostic yield, patient age at diagnosis, and medical impact in the 
group that underwent critical trio exome is significantly different comparing to regular exome 
testing. For deceased infants (n=81), genetic disorders were molecular diagnosed in 39 (48.1%) by 
exome sequencing with implications for recurrence risk counseling.
Conclusions and relevance: Exome sequencing is a powerful tool for the diagnostic 
evaluation of critically ill infants with suspected monogenic disorders in the neonatal and pediatric 
ICUs, leading to notable impact on clinical decision-making.
Congenital malformations are estimated to be present in 13% of all admissions to neonatal 
intensive care units (NICUs) in the developed countries1,2 and remain the leading cause of 
neonatal mortality (estimated at 20–34%).3,4 While cytogenetic abnormalities5 and copy 
number variants (CNVs)6 are known causes of birth defects in seriously ill neonates, single-
gene disorders are also significant contributors.7–11 The diagnostic tests for the clinical 
evaluation of newborns with suspected genetic diseases have expanded exponentially in 
recent years, particularly with the institution of the next-generation sequencing (NGS). As 
the overall burden of Mendelian disorders in neonates is being delineated via exome or 
whole genome sequencing (WGS) for newborn screening and other studies,12–14 clinical 
geneticists and neonatologists are in a unique position to initiate evidence-based studies in 
large tertiary care centers, deliver care that combines state of the art diagnostic tools and 
genetic counseling, and provide reproductive options regarding serious genetic diseases in 
at-risk families.
The clinical utility of rapid genome-wide sequencing was first demonstrated by Saunders et 
al. in 2012 in two neonates diagnosed by WGS within 50 hours 15, and later by others in 
critically ill neonates or newborns, providing a diagnostic yield ranging from 40% to 57%.
7,10 The need for a rapid comprehensive genetic diagnosis in ICUs for critically ill babies, 
especially those in level III and IV NICUs is paramount for both prognostication and clinical 
decision-making.8,16
Here, we systematically evaluated the clinical utility of exome sequencing in the largest 
study sample to date in the ICU setting, of 278 unrelated infants ≤100 days old from a single 
institution.
Methods
Clinical Samples
A total of 278 consecutive unrelated infants were retrospectively studied based on the 
following inclusion criteria: (1) age ≤100 days of life at the time of testing; (2) referred from 
Texas Children’s Hospital (Houston, TX) for exome sequencing from December 2011 to 
January 2017; and (3) exome sequencing performed at Baylor Genetics (Houston, TX) as a 
clinical service. Detailed clinical evaluation with comprehensive pre-test counseling was 
undertaken for all infants. The assessment for the need of clinical exome sequencing was 
carried out by multiple board-certified clinical geneticists at Texas Children’s Hospital.

 Relevant clinic notes were provided to the clinical laboratory. Parents provided consents for 
clinical exome testing with the option of receiving information on medically actionable 
findings and carrier status recommended by ACMG practice guidelines.17–19 The clinical 
aggregate data were collected with the approval of Baylor Institutional Review Board.
Exome Sequencing and Analysis
The 278 infants were studied by proband exome (available since December 2011), trio 
exome (available since October 2014), or critical trio exome (a rapid test available since 
April 2015) offered at Baylor Genetics as a clinical test and conducted as described.20,21 For 
this study, the average depth of coverage was 154X with 97.5% of the targeted regions 
(exonic regions of all nuclear genes plus +/− 5bp of exon-intron boundaries) sequenced at 
20X and higher (eTable 1 in the Supplement). All samples were concurrently analyzed by 
Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad or HumanExome-12 v1 array for quality-control, and 
detecting large copy-number variants (CNVs), absence of heterozygosity(AOH), and 
uniparental disomy (UPD). CNVs were also characterized using normalization of exome 
read depth as previously described.22 The procedures for regular and critical trio exome 
sequencing were highly similar except that critical exome cases were assigned a STAT test 
code and given the highest priority. Exome data were interpreted according to ACMG 
guidelines and variant interpretation guidelines of Baylor Genetics as previously described.
20–23
Molecular Diagnoses and Clinical Exome Reporting
Reporting of laboratory findings was performed as previously described.20,21 A case was 
classified as molecularly diagnosed when pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant(s) were 
detected in a disease gene associated with the phenotype observed in the studied individual; 
in addition, the zygosity of the mutant allele must match the inheritance pattern associated 
with the disease gene. For further validation, exome sequencing reports were additionally 
analyzed by board certified clinical geneticists in view of clinical correlation, follow-up 
evaluation, and confirmation of molecular diagnosis.
Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) analysis
Clinical notes were rendered to HPO terms through BioLark natural language processing 
system and manual review.24 Analyses were performed using Fisher tests to compare the 
diagnostic rate among patients annotated and under each top-branch HPO category. The 
False Discovery method (FDR) was used to transform Fisher p-values into q-values to 
address multiple testing across HPO terms.
Results
Demographics and Testing Indications
Of the 278 infants, 190 (68.3%) were in NICU at the time of sample submission, 43 (15.5%) 
were in the cardiovascular intensive care unit (CVICU), and 18 (6.5%) in the pediatric 
intensive care unit (PICU). There were 127 females (45%) and 151 males (55%), with a 
median age of 28 days at the time of sample submission (Table 1). Clinical indications for

 exome sequencing included a wide range of clinical concerns (eTable 2 in the Supplement). 
Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) was completed in 237/278 (85%) infants.
Exome Sequencing Diagnoses in ICU
Exome sequencing method included proband exome (n=178), trio exome (n=37), or critical 
trio exome (n=63), depending on the availability of parental samples and tests at the time, 
and the overall cardiopulmonary status of the patients. There was no significant difference in 
patients’ age and ICU admission rate at the time of testing among the three testing 
categories, although infants referred for critical exome were more likely to be in the ICU 
(61/63=96.8%) (Table 1).
Of the 278 infants, 102 individuals (36.7%) affected with 106 disorders, met criteria for 
molecular diagnosis (Table 1, Table 2 and eTable 3). Critical trio exome provided 
significantly higher molecular diagnoses in 32/63 infants (50.8%) than proband exome in 
58/178 infants (32.6%) and trio exome in 12/37 cases (32.4%) (p=0.011226, Fisher’s test). 
The median turnaround time was 13.0 days, shorter than that of proband exome (95.0 days) 
and trio exome (51.1 days) (p<0.00001. t-test). Consequently, the median age of diagnosis in 
infants getting critical exome (33.1±5.6 days) was significantly younger than those 
undergoing proband or trio exome (116.5±27.4 and 78.0±103.1 days old, respectively) 
(p=0.001883, t-test).
Of the 102 solved cases, 56 (54.9%) had exome sequencing as a first-tier test (Table 3). For 
those individuals the average age at diagnosis was significantly younger than that in the 
others (p=0.007907, t-test). This is attributed to a younger age at test initiation, a greater 
proportion of patients undergoing critical trio exome, and a faster turnaround time with 
critical trio exome (Table 3).
Autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive and X-linked disorders were observed in 49 
(46.2%), 44 (41.5%) and 13 (12.3%) infants respectively (Table 4). Four out of the 102 
infants (3.9%) had dual molecular diagnoses (eTable 4 in the supplement). CNVs were 
detected in 11 individuals by NGS read depth and cSNP array; both are components of the 
exome assay (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Of the diagnosed cases, KMT2D-related Kabuki 
syndrome (MIM:147920), and Noonan spectrum disorders (MIM: 163950, 611553), caused 
by variants in PTPN11 and RAF1, were observed in 8 (~8%) infants and comprise the most 
frequent single-gene diagnosis in the ICUs by exome. Both diseases presented in early 
infancy with significant cardiovascular abnormalities. Other genes found in at least 2 infants 
are summarized in eTable 5 in the Supplement, collectively comprising 11% (12/102) of the 
diagnoses in ICUs.
Approximately 39/102 (38%) of diagnosed individuals had atypical or unrecognized 
infantile presentation of genetic disorders. Of these, 4/39 (10%) infants were diagnosed with 
novel Mendelian diseases that were not reported initially and were only determined upon re-
examination of the WES data; Some examples include that of an infant with severe 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hypoglycemia caused by a LZTR1 variant, and a neonate 
with congenital hypotonia and respiratory failure due to defect in PURA. For well known 
genetic disorders such as Kabuki syndrome caused by KMT2D mutation, craniofacial

 features were atypical or under-recognized in all four infants. Some other examples of 
atypical presentation in neonates of known Mendelian disorders include AKT3 related 
megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus syndrome in an individual with 
hypoglycemia, hyperlactatemia metabolic acidosis, and borderline prominent lateral 
ventricles without macrocephaly at birth, and TUBA1A mutation presenting as 
ventriculomegaly with fully formed corpus callosum.
To assess whether specific clinical presentations were more likely to be associated with 
molecular diagnosis, the diagnostic rate was compared among patients annotated with 
different phenotypes as represented by HPO terms. Analyses were performed at the top level 
branching of HPO phenotypes to ensure adequate counts of subjects. Individuals with 
phenotypes of the HPO category “abnormality of the cardiovascular system” (HP: 0001626) 
were found to be significantly under-represented in cases with molecular diagnosis 
(p=0.000452, FDR q=0.0090). “Abnormality of blood and blood-forming tissues” (HP:
0001871) and “abnormality of the musculature” (HP:0003011) were found to yield higher 
diagnostic rate (p= 0.00284 and p=0.00967, FDR q=0.028 and q=0.0644, respectively) 
(Table 5).
Impact of Exome Sequencing on Clinical Management
We then evaluated the impact of molecular diagnosis by exome sequencing on medical 
management in four distinct areas: (a) redirection of care, (b) initiation of new subspecialist 
care, including additional diagnostic studies (c) changes in medication or diet, and (d) major 
procedures such as transplantation carried out in patients relevant to the genetic diagnoses. 
Using these considerations, we observed that molecular diagnoses directly affected medical 
management in 53/102 (52.0%) of patients after results were reported (Table 2 and eTable 3 
in the Supplement). This rate is particularly higher in infants who received diagnosis through 
critical exome sequencing (23/32, 71.9%), compared to the other two groups that went 
through regular exome workup (30/70, 42.9%) (Table 1, p=0.009902). Of the positive cases 
in the critical trio exome group, a significantly higher portion (21/32 or 65.5%, p<0.00001) 
were diagnosed before discharge (Table 1).
Of the four aforementioned categories, first, informed redirection of care (including 
palliative care and withdrawal of life support) was undertaken in 19/53 (35.8%) infants 
(eTable 6 in the Supplement) with serious disorders such as muscular dystrophy-
dystroglycanopathy type A, 7 [MIM:614643] (case 1247), and alveolar capillary dysplasia 
with misalignment of pulmonary veins [MIM:265380] (case 1028), and arterial calcification 
of infancy, generalized, 1 [MIM: 208000] (case 1202). Second, 27/53 infants (50.9%) 
benefitted from initiation of new subspecialist care, which was unanticipated prior to genetic 
testing. Examples include a diagnosis of aortic stenosis after cardiology evaluation in an 
infant with nephronophthisis and liver disease caused bycompound heterozygous variants in 
NPHP3 (case 1002). Similarly, diagnosis of short-rib thoracic dysplasia 3 with or without 
polydactyly [MIM:613091] in two infants allowed evaluation of renal, hepatic, pancreatic 
and ocular involvement in this ciliopathy-related disorder (case 1005, 1010). Third, dietary 
and medication changes likely impacted treatment of at least 7/53 infants (13.2%) including 
one with ALDH7A1 related pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (MIM:266100), who improved

 significantly with cessation of seizures after high dose pyridoxine supplementation (case 
1022). Another neonate with Menkes disease was started on copper histidine injections (case 
1201). Lastly, major procedures such as transplantation were instituted in 5/53 infants 
(9.4%) who are all currently living. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was 
carried out in 3 infants; one with RAG1 variants causing severe combined 
immunodeficiency (case 1021), another with UNC13D variants presenting with 
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) (case 1007), and a third infant with congenital 
pancytopenia due to defects in FANCA (case 1006). Cardiac transplantation was undertaken 
in an infant with a PTPN11 variant presenting with severe concentric left ventricular 
hypertrophy after birth and severe pulmonic stenosis (case 1258), and another with left 
ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) due to a causal variant in ACTC1 (case 1108).
Of the 102 infants who received a molecular diagnosis, 30 (29.4%) succumbed to their 
disease before 120 day of life (Table 1). In contrast, 28/170 (16.5%) infants in the 
undiagnosed group passed away (p=0.014393, Fisher test). Of all the deceased infants at the 
time of study (n=81), genetic disorders were confirmed in 39 (48.1%) by clinical exome.
Genetic Counseling
In addition to the medical impact to the patient self, exome sequencing also offer potential 
influence on the health management for family members and prevention of serious single-
gene disorders in at-risk couples. Comprehensive genetic counseling was provided by a 
board-certified genetic counselor and/or clinical geneticists in 90/102 (88.2%) families who 
received a diagnosis. If an infant was deceased by the time the results were available, the 
parents were offered a follow-up counseling visit to discuss the genetic test results. 
Medically actionable secondary findings or carrier status were identified in 21 patients, 
among 267 families who agreed to receive this information (7.9%) (eTable 7 in the 
Supplement). Clinical exome sequencing diagnoses in infants directly affected parental 
health in at least two families: one with BRCA2 variants revealing the genetic basis of 
cancer in both maternal and paternal sides of the family (case 1111); and another with 
ACTC1 variant inherited from his father and paternal grandfather with diagnosis of 
pulmonary stenosis with ventricular septal defect and atrial septal defect, respectively (case 
1108).
Partially Diagnosed and Negative Cases
Of the infants who were considered undiagnosed in this analysis, 4 infants received a partial 
diagnosis by exome sequencing, with relevant variants explaining only part of the phenotype 
(eTable 8 in the Supplement). Of the cases negative for exome results, one infant with 
neonatal hypotonia was diagnosed with myotonic dystrophy, detected by Southern blot 
analysis. Another was found to have infantile botulism.
Overall, 170/278 (61%) patients remained undiagnosed in this study. Clinical CMA a 
separate test, was done in 150/170 (~88%) of the undiagnosed infants, and no additional 
diagnoses were revealed by the analysis. In 85 out of 170 undiagnosed patients, 
mitochondrial genome sequencing was also performed which was non-diagnostic.

 Discussion
We studied the impact of clinical exome sequencing in 278 infants predominantly in ICUs at 
a single tertiary institution in the first 100 days of life and ascertained 106 known disorders 
in 102 infants (with overall detection rate of 36.7%). Significantly higher detection rates 
with critical/rapid exome sequencing in seriously-ill infants have been shown in this study 
(50.8%, n=63), as well as in previous STATseq studies involving relatively smaller number 
of infants (57%, n=35).11,15 In our study, seriously ill infants were evaluated and selected for 
rapid exome study by clinical geneticists based on skilled clinical assessment. For the vast 
majority of infants selected for the rapid study, the indications included neuromuscular 
diseases, syndromic congenital cardiovascular malformations, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
with assessment for cardiac transplant; skeletal malformations and/or dysplasia; neonatal 
cholestasis and liver failure; lung disease including alveolar capillary dysplasia; cystic renal 
disease; and metabolic disorders with persistent lactic acidosis. This ascertainment likely 
allowed much greater probability of determining the underlying genetic cause for timely 
clinical management of very sick infants. Ultimately, the overall diagnostic rate of rapid 
exome sequencing would be driven by the eligibility screening of seriously-ill infants 
suspected to have genetic disorders, combined with institution-based cost concerns, and the 
practicability of obtaining rapid results for recognizable single gene-disorders.
Indications for clinical exome sequencing that were assessed to be of relatively low 
diagnostic yield by HPO phenotype analysis included isolated cardiovascular malformations, 
congenital diaphragmatic hernia in association with congenital heart defect (CHD), multiple 
congenital anomalies associated with maternal diabetes, and CHD with VACTERL 
association. On the other hand, HPO analysis determined a higher diagnostic rate for 
“abnormality of the musculature” phenotype, including hypotonia and joint contractures in 
this cohort. In another study, more complex phenotype has been noted to yield a higher 
diagnosis rate comparing to isolated phenotype.25 Further studies in larger sample size are 
needed to corroborate these data for selecting infants most likely to benefit from exome 
sequencing in ICUs.
This study exposes a myriad of monogenic disorders that have been under-ascertained in 
critically ill neonates up until now.11 While a comprehensive clinical evaluation is vital in 
allowing single-gene or panel testing in a subset of sick infants in the ICU, the power of 
NGS is indisputable in the expeditious detection of disorders that are clinically 
heterogeneous or complex due to dual diagnoses.26 Every year, approximately 250 new 
monogenic disorders are described due to the escalating use of NGS.27 The rapid pace of 
scientific advancement presents a considerable challenge, even to the most astute clinicians 
who provide care to infants suspected to have genetic disorders in critical care setting. While 
targeted testing is judicious in select cases, failure or delay in detecting causative variants in 
critically ill infants is a substantial concern, mitigated by exome sequencing. The atypical 
and unrecognized presentation of genetic disorders observed in about a significant 38% of 
these young infants further challenges the traditional paradigm of tiered genetic testing in 
critical care units.

 Many qualities of exome sequencing that make it attractive as a clinical diagnostic tool, also 
present challenges for conducting traditional forms of economic evaluation of the service. In 
a recent study, performing exome sequencing as first-line test in infants achieved over three 
times diagnosis rate, with less than one-third of the cost, compared with simulated 
traditional tiered testing strategy of single gene or gene panels.28 Additional studies on the 
cost-effectiveness are needed to inform both clinical and third party payers. For any 
individual patient, the cost-effectiveness of exome sequencing will differ according to the 
type of exome study performed, the point in the diagnostic pathway when exome sequencing 
is performed, and the particular genetic condition implicated. Analyses of data should aim to 
inform the clinical decision-making process through elucidation of the optimal role of 
sequencing for different groups of patients, taking both costs and impacts on clinical 
decision making as well as family planning into account. For example, the higher diagnostic 
yield from rapid exome testing should be considered alongside the higher associated cost for 
tests with reduced turnaround time. The cost to establish a diagnosis is of interest, as is the 
cost of exome sequencing as it relates to a health outcome. The most informative studies 
would provide evidence on the type of patient for whom exome sequencing is the most cost-
effective form of diagnostic testing which leads to a molecular diagnosis and a change in 
care rendered according to the results.
Conclusion
Our study provides strong evidence that clinical exome sequencing uncovers monogenic 
disorders in a significant number of infants in NICU and PICU suspected to have genetic 
disorders, significantly impacting the medical care of over half of these diagnosed infants.

 Key Points
Question:
What is the clinical utility of exome sequencing, when employed in neonatal and 
pediatric intensive care units?
Findings:
In this retrospective study of 278 infants within the 100 days of life referred for clinical 
exome sequencing, 36.7% received a genetic diagnosis, with medical management 
impacted in 52.0% of the diagnosed patients; critical trio exome testing yielded a higher 
diagnostic rate (50.8%) at an earlier age (TAT 13.0 ± 0.4 days), and are more likely to 
impact medical management (71.9%).
Meaning:
Utilizing exome sequencing in intensive care units can significantly impact the medical 
care of critically ill infants suspected to have genetic disorders.
