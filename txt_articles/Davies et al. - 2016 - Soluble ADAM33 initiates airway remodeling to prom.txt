Introduction
Even though our insight into the pathophysiology of asthma has increased, it still remains a substantial 
health and economic burden, with 300 million patients suffering from asthma worldwide. It is a complex 
disease involving gene-environment interactions, and most individuals with asthma exhibit allergen-in-
duced Th2-type inflammatory responses associated with increased expression of cytokines from the IL-4 
gene cluster linked to atopy (1). Asthma is also characterized by structural remodeling and thickening of 
the inner airway wall, involving an increase in bronchial smooth muscle, collagen deposition, and neo-
angiogenesis. The classical paradigm of allergic asthma (2) suggests that Th2-type–driven airway inflam-
mation plays a causal role in airway remodeling (i.e., inflammation precedes remodeling) (3) to result in 
the typical asthmatic phenotype (4–6). However, the early use of inhaled corticosteroids for wheezing in 
preschool children does not affect the natural history of asthma or wheeze later in childhood (7). Similarly, 
although treatment of mild-to-moderate asthmatic children with antiinflammatory drugs provides asthma 
control and reduces airway responsiveness to methacholine, this fails to improve lung function when com-
pared with placebo (8). Since airway remodeling (9) and bronchial smooth muscle (10) are increased in 
the airways of young children who subsequently progress to develop asthma, these studies suggest distinct 
mechanisms that affect remodeling early in the disease course, but the causal factors are unknown (11).
While the genetic susceptibility to atopy alone cannot explain asthma (12), the functional contribution 
of other asthma susceptibility genes to disease pathogenesis is poorly understood (13). A disintegrin and 
metalloprotease 33 (ADAM33) is a susceptibility gene associated with asthma and bronchial hyperrespon-
siveness (BHR) (14, 15), a finding that has been replicated in multiple populations (16). ADAM33 alleles 
are also associated with an increased risk for COPD (17), accelerated lung function decline across the 
life course (18, 19), and impaired lung function early in life (20), suggesting a role in airway remodeling. 
ADAM33 is mainly expressed in airway smooth muscle, fibroblasts, and mesenchymal progenitor cells 
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airways disease that usually begins in early life and involves 
gene-environment interactions. Although most asthma exhibits allergic inflammation, many 
allergic individuals do not have asthma. Here, we report how the asthma gene a disintegrin and 
metalloprotease 33 (ADAM33) acts as local tissue susceptibility gene that promotes allergic asthma. 
We show that enzymatically active soluble ADAM33 (sADAM33) is increased in asthmatic airways 
and plays a role in airway remodeling, independent of inflammation. Furthermore, remodeling 
and inflammation are both suppressed in Adam33-null mice after allergen challenge. When 
induced in utero or added ex vivo, sADAM33 causes structural remodeling of the airways, which 
enhances postnatal airway eosinophilia and bronchial hyperresponsiveness following subthreshold 
challenge with an aeroallergen. This substantial gene-environment interaction helps to explain the 
end-organ expression of allergic asthma in genetically susceptible individuals. Finally, we show 
that sADAM33-induced airway remodeling is reversible, highlighting the therapeutic potential of 
targeting ADAM33 in asthma.

(21, 22), with each playing a role in asthma-related airway remodeling (23, 24). Although it is a mem-
brane-anchored protein, ADAM33 can be detected as a soluble protein (sADAM33) in asthmatic airways 
in which high levels of sADAM33 are correlated with reduced lung function (25). Little is understood 
about the contribution of sADAM33 to the pathogenesis of asthma, although it is known that sADAM33 
protein is induced in utero by maternal allergy (26) and the enzymatically active recombinant protein is 
proangiogenic (27). Herein, we provide insight into how the disease-related sADAM33 protein promotes 
airway remodeling without inflammation; we also demonstrate a substantial gene-environment interac-
tion in which sADAM33-induced airway remodeling in early life affects the susceptibility of the airway 
tissue to environmental allergens to promote allergic airway inflammation and BHR. Finally, we show that 
ADAM33-driven airway remodeling is reversible, highlighting the potential for sADAM33 as a target for 
disease-modifying therapy.
Results
sADAM33 is increased in asthma. Since ADAM33 contains a metalloprotease (MP) domain, we tested if 
sADAM33 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) is enzymatically active. Consistent with a previous 
report (25), immunoreactive sADAM33 was detected in BALF using an antibody against the MP domain, 
with a strong band at approximately 25 kDa (MP domain), another at approximately 52 kDa (unprocessed 
MP domain, i.e., Pro-MP), and other minor bands of higher molecular weight (ectodomain fragments

domain using an antibody against the Pro domain (Supplemental Figure 1A; supplemental material avail-
able online with this article; doi:10.1172/jci.insight.87632DS1). The bands were similar to those previously 
characterized in BALF from sarcoid patients (28) and were significantly increased in asthma (Figure 1B 
and Supplemental Figure 1B). Neither ADAM33 antibody cross-reacted with recombinant ADAM8 and 
ADAM12 (Supplemental Figure 2, A–C), which have been associated with asthma (29–31) and show high 
homology with ADAM33. Furthermore, using an ADAM33-specific fluorescence resonance energy trans-
fer (FRET) peptide cleavage assay, ADAM33 enzymatic activity was increased in asthma (Figure 1C). 
The presence of active sADAM33 in BALF was independent of corticosteroid treatment or the airway 
inflammatory cell profile (Supplemental Table 1). We also analyzed BALF from inbred mice after sensiti-
zation and challenge with house dust mite (HDM) extract allergen (Supplemental Figure 3), which induces

features of asthma in murine lungs. Western blotting using an antibody to murine ADAM33 antibody (26) 
revealed distinct protein bands similar to the human ADAM33 at approximately 52 to 76 kDa (Figure 1, 
D and E), smaller than the processed form of full-length mouse ADAM33 (approximately 110 kDa) and 
consistent with its proteolytic cleavage from its membrane-bound form to release sADAM33 ectodomain 
into the airways (32). Similar to the findings in human BALF, enzymatic activity of murine sADAM33 
was significantly increased in the BALF of lungs from HDM-challenged mice when compared with the 
equivalent control mice (Figure 1F).
sADAM33 causes airway remodeling. To assess directly the function of sADAM33 in vivo, a doxycycline-in-
ducible (Dox-inducible) human sADAM33 transgenic mouse model was generated by injecting a linearized

When 6- to 8-week-old mice were fed a diet containing Dox for 4 or 8 weeks to induce 
transgene expression of human sADAM33 (Supplemental Figure 5A), there were no sig-
nificant changes in the airway expression of inflammatory (Ccl11 [also known as Eotaxin], 
Il5, Il13, Cxcl1 [also known as Kc]) or goblet cell (Muc5ac) markers (Figure 2, F–J), and 
there was no evidence of inflammatory cells in the BALF of these mice (Supplemental 
Figure 5B). In contrast, α-smooth muscle actin (Acta2; also known as α-Sma) mRNA and 
that of other genes linked to airway remodeling, including collagen 1 and 3 (Col1a1 and 
Col3a1), fibronectin (Fn1), and platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (Pecam1; also 
known as CD31), were increased in whole lungs of DTg Ccsp/ADAM33 mice compared with STg littermate 
controls (Figure 2, K–O). Immunofluorescence staining for ACTA2 and PECAM1 in DTg Ccsp/ADAM33 
mice revealed increased smooth muscle surrounding the airways and airway vessels (Figure 2, Q and S) 
compared with STg littermate controls (Figure 2, P and R). Together, these data support promyogenic and 
proangiogenic functions (27) for sADAM33. However, these remodeling changes failed to elicit BHR in 
response to inhaled methacholine (Supplemental Figure 5C).
sADAM33 causes airway “remodeling” in developing lung. Since sADAM33 protein can be induced in utero 
by maternal allergy (26), we also determined the effect of inducing human sADAM33 during lung devel-
opment by feeding transgenic mice a Dox diet during pregnancy and for up to 4 weeks after birth (Supple-
mental Figure 5D). This caused sADAM33 to be expressed in the fetal lungs from around embryonic day 
(ED) 14/15 (corresponding to the time when the CCSP promoter becomes active; ref. 34) until the mice 
were euthanized for analysis. From as early as ED17.5, the airway remodeling genes Acta2, Col1a1, Col3a1, 
Fn1, and Pecam1 were all increased in whole lungs of DTg Ccsp/ADAM33 mice compared with STg litter-
mate controls (Figure 3, A–E), while the inflammatory markers, Ccl11, Il5, Il13, and Cxcl1, and goblet cell 
marker, Muc5ac, were not affected (Figure 3, F–J), as was the case in the adult transgenic mice (Figure 2, 
F–O). Immunofluorescence histochemistry in lungs of 4-week-old Ccsp/ADAM33 mice confirmed marked 
induction of airway remodeling involving increased airway and vascular smooth muscle compared with 
control mice (Figure 3, K–N). As observed with the adult transgenic mice, these remodeling changes failed 
to elicit inflammation (Supplemental Figure 5E) or BHR in response to inhaled methacholine (Supplemen-
tal Figure 5F).
Importantly, we also found that exposure of human embryonic lung explants to highly purified 
enzymatically active recombinant sADAM33-Pro-MP in vitro caused increased bronchial smooth 
muscle in developing airways; this effect was dependent on the catalytic activity of the enzyme (Figure 
3, P and R), since mutation of the active site (E346A) was inactive and failed to reproduce this effect 
(Figure 3, O and Q).
Allergen-induced asthma-like changes are inhibited in Adam33–/– mice. To determine whether ADAM33 is 
required for allergen-induced airway remodeling, we evaluated Adam33-null (Adam33–/–) mice (Supplemen-
tal Figure 6) after intraperitoneal sensitization and intratracheal challenge with HDM allergen (Supple-
mental Figure 3). Although a previous report had failed to observe changes in ovalbumin-induced airway 
responses in Adam33–/– mice (35), we investigated effects of HDM extract as a common human aeroaller-
gen to model more closely human asthma. In WT mice, HDM challenge caused an increase in sADAM33 
enzyme activity in BALF, whereas there was no significant effect in Adam33–/– mice (Supplemental Figure 
7A), confirming the specificity of the ADAM33 FRET assay. Similarly, after HDM challenge, Acta2, Col1a1, 
Col3a1, and Fn1 mRNAs were significantly increased in whole lungs of WT mice (Figure 4, A–D), but 
these mRNAs were suppressed in the Adam33-deleted mice in a gene dosage-dependent fashion. Compared 
with saline-treated control mice (Figure 4, E, G, I, and K), the HDM-induced increase in smooth muscle 
around the airways and vessels of WT mice (Figure 4, F and H) was suppressed in the lungs of HDM-chal-
lenged Adam33–/– mice (Figure 4, J and L) and paralleled by reduced methacholine-induced BHR (Figure 5 
and Supplemental Figure 7B). Of note, mRNAs encoding the Th2-type inflammatory genes, Ccl11, Il5, and 
Il13 but not Cxcl1, were also suppressed in the HDM-challenged Adam33–/– mice (Figure 6, A–D) and were 
associated with a decrease in CCL11 and IL-5 (Figure 6, E and F) and eosinophils (Figure 6G) in BALF.

These data suggest a previously unappreciated role for sADAM33 in regulating Th2-type inflammation.
Early-life induction of  sADAM33 enhances allergen-induced asthma-like changes. To test the hypothesis that sAD-
AM33 enhances asthma-like responses in the presence of a Th2 stimulus, we treated Ccsp/ADAM33 and STg 
littermate control mice with recombinant IL-13 (Supplemental Figure 8A) and found a significant increase 
in mRNA expression of the fibroblast-derived chemokine, Ccl11, in the sADAM33-expressing mice (Figure 
7A). This amplification effect led us to consider the potential for early-life interactions between sADAM33 
and Th2-type inflammation in response to low concentrations of allergen. We first performed a concentra-
tion-response experiment with HDM extract with a standard sensitization protocol (Supplemental Figure 3) 
to determine the amount of HDM extract (6.25 μg), which elicited minimal BHR, eosinophilia, and Ccl11 
and Muc5ac mRNA (Supplemental Figure 8, B–E) in WT mice. This low-dose allergen challenge protocol 
was then applied to DTg Ccsp/ADAM33 and STg littermate control mice in which transgene expression was 
induced during lung development and early life (Supplemental Figure 9A). In response to HDM challenge, 
expression of genes mediating airway remodeling, Acta2, Col1a1, Col3a1, Fn1, and Pecam1 (Figure 7, B–F); 
Th2 inflammatory cytokines, Ccl11, Il5, and Il13 (Figure 7, G–I); and mucus production Muc5ac (Figure 7K), 
but not Cxcl1 (Figure 7J), were increased in DTg Ccsp/ADAM33 mice compared with equivalently treated STg 
littermate controls. Enhanced expression of inflammation and remodeling genes in the Ccsp/ADAM33 mice 
was accompanied by increased airway resistance, as measured by BHR in response to methacholine (Figure 
7L and Supplemental Figure 9, B and C), and accompanied by BALF eosinophilia (Figure 7M).
Airway remodeling induced by sADAM33 is reversible. As a susceptibility gene close to the origin of asthma, 
ADAM33 is a potential therapeutic target. However, as airway remodeling is considered to be a relatively 
irreversible process, therapeutic intervention depends on demonstration that sADAM33-induced airway 
remodeling can be reversed after sADAM33 expression is blocked. This concept was tested using the DTg 
Ccsp/ADAM33 transgenic mice in which sADAM33 expression can be regulated by provision, or removal, 
of Dox from the diet. In these experiments, sADAM33 expression was commenced in utero and continued 
for 28 days postpartum (PD28) to promote a robust remodeling response; this was followed by 28 days 
without Dox feed to assess reversibility of the remodeling response (Supplemental Figure 10A). At day

airway remodeling genes, Acta2, Col1a1, Col3a1, Fn1, and Pecam1, had returned to baseline levels in whole

by the presence or absence of sADAM33 expression (Figure 8, F–J). Immunofluorescence histochemistry 
applied to lungs from 28- and 56-day-old Ccsp/ADAM33 mice that were maintained on Dox in utero and 
throughout the whole experiment confirmed marked induction of airway remodeling, involving increased 
airway and vascular smooth muscle at both time points (Figure 8, L and N) compared with control mice 
(Figure 8K). However the lungs of DTg Ccsp/ADAM33 mice on Dox diet for 28 days and then without 
Dox for 28 days showed a reduction in airway remodeling, with decreased staining for airway and vascular 
smooth muscle (Figure 8M), similar to the STg littermate control mice (Figure 8K).
Discussion
In this report, we have defined the function of ADAM33 as a local tissue susceptibility gene for asthma and 
have uncovered a substantial interaction between sADAM33-mediated airway remodeling and sensitivity 
to allergen exposure, leading to allergic inflammation and BHR in early life. Ectopic expression of human 
sADAM33 in adult or fetal murine airways caused airway remodeling, which was completely reversible 
if expression of human sADAM33 was switched off. Almost identical structural changes (remodeling) 
were observed in human fetal lung in the presence of exogenous, enzymatically active sADAM33 but 
not the mutated, inactive enzyme. While on its own airway remodeling did not trigger inflammation or 
BHR in murine lungs, the remodeled lungs of mice expressing sADAM33 in utero were more suscepti-
ble to low amounts of HDM allergen exposure, resulting in augmented BHR and eosinophilia in early 
postnatal life. Since sADAM33 enhances the effects of low amounts of allergen to produce asthma-like 
features, sADAM33-induced airway remodeling could explain the difference in susceptibility of asthmatic

individuals to environmental allergens, compared 
with atopic nonasthmatic subjects. This may be 
because sADAM33-induced airway remodeling 
results in increased numbers of fibroblast and 
smooth muscle cells that can produce mediators 
such as CCL11 (36, 37), which amplifies inflam-
mation. Since sADAM33 is also proangiogenic 
(27), it may facilitate ingress of eosinophils or oth-
er inflammatory cells into the tissue in response to 
these chemoattractants.
The importance of ADAM33 for allergic 
airway responses was further highlighted using 
Adam33–/– mice in which HDM-induced airway 
inflammation, remodeling, and BHR were all 
markedly reduced in the absence of ADAM33. 
These data indicate an obligatory role for ADAM33 
in the pathobiology of allergic airways disease 
via a mechanism involving loss of its membrane 
anchor,which produces a dysregulated protein (i.e., 
a gain of function). Consistent with this, we found 
that sADAM33-Pro-MP protein and enzymatic 
activity was increased in human asthma and that 
levels were not affected by corticosteroid treatment.
The ability of sADAM33 to promote airway remodeling is consistent with the association of ADAM33 
polymorphism with BHR (14) and reduced lung function (18–20). Furthermore, our observation that levels 
of sADAM33 in human asthma are unaffected by corticosteroids would help explain the inability of cor-
ticosteroid treatment to affect lung function in young children (8) or the natural history of the disease (7). 
Present findings challenge the classical paradigm of allergic asthma, in which Th2-driven airway inflam-
mation has primacy over airway remodeling to result in the typical asthmatic phenotype (2, 4–6). Both 
inflammation and remodeling seem to be of importance and mutually cooperative at different stages of 
the life course. Since sADAM33 is induced in utero by maternal allergy (26), this may explain why airway 
remodeling (9) and bronchial smooth muscle (10) are increased in the airways of young children who 
subsequently develop asthma. These remodeled airways may provide the “soil” that supports exaggerated 
responses to allergens in the airways of susceptible individuals, leading to the Th2-type inflammation and 
BHR that characterizes asthma. Such a paradigm might explain the association of ADAM33 polymor-
phism with progression of preschool wheeze into childhood asthma (38) (Figure 9).
Individual approaches used in the current study have their inherent limitations. While specific expres-
sion of human sADAM33 might have been preferred in pulmonary mesenchymal cells that are the main 
site of ADAM33 expression (14, 21), the advantage of lung epithelial expression was that sADAM33 was 
released into the airway lumen, as observed in human asthma. The relevance of the transgenic model 
was further confirmed using WT mice in which murine sADAM33 was observed in BALF after allergen 
challenge; it was further supported by data from Adam33-null mice demonstrating that ADAM33 plays an 
essential role in the development of inflammation and remodeling in this model. One unresolved ques-
tion is how sADAM33 is released and transferred into the lumen of the airways in asthma. Future work 
should focus on the role of disease-associated SNPs, especially those in the transmembrane and cytoplas-
mic domains (14), which might result in increased susceptibility for release of sADAM33 and, as a conse-
quence, in stimulation of airway remodeling.
Currently, most asthma treatments are directed against Th2 inflammation (3, 39), with little effect 
on airway remodeling. The rationale for targeting the MP of ADAM33 is strongly supported by our 
human and mouse data, which both provide strong evidence for a key role of sADAM33 as an initiator

of remodeling, independent of inflammation, that is prevented by a mutant inactive MP and is reversible 
when sADAM33 expression is arrested.
Although targeting MPs for diseases such as cancer has been historically problematic due to off-target 
effects (40), this problem may be overcome by development of specific small-molecule inhibitors of the 
sADAM33 MP based on the unique ADAM33 crystal structure (41, 42). Alternatively, the development 
of monoclonal antibodies, antisense nucleic acids, or specific microRNAs (43) may enable development of 
highly specific sADAM33 therapeutic approaches. Any of these strategies would be amenable to proof-of-
concept testing using the murine models described herein prior to translation into human studies. Develop-
ment of any such agent that successfully inhibits sADAM33-MP would be anticipated to have potential, as 
disease-modifying asthma therapies close to the origin of asthma (11).
Methods
Human samples. BALF was obtained from healthy and asthmatic donors (Supplemental Table 1) by fiber-
optic bronchoscopy performed in accordance to the British Thoracic Society guidelines (44) and standard 
operating procedures of the NIHR Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility and NIHR Southampton 
Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit at the University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust. 
BAL was performed by instilling 6 × 20 ml aliquots of prewarmed normal saline into a subsegmental 
bronchus of the anterior segment of the right upper lobe followed by gentle suction. Prior to processing, 
recovered BALF was filtered (BD Falcon cell strainer, Marathon Laboratory Supplies) and then centrifuged 
at 1,300 g for 10 minutes at 4°C. In order to prepare samples for cytospin and supernatant storage, the cell 
pellet was resuspended in PBS following removal of the supernatant, which was stored at –80°C for later 
analysis. Cytocentrifuged (Cytospin 4 Cytocentrifuge, Thermo Shandon Ltd.) cells were stained with rapid 
Romanowsky stain (Raymond Lamb Ltd.) for differential cell counts of macrophages, neutrophils, eosino-
phils, lymphocytes, and epithelial cells. A total of 400 cells was counted on coded samples by an operator 
unaware of the participant’s clinical characterization.
Human embryonic tissue was collected, staged, and processed as described previously (45). Gestational 
age was between 8 and 10 weeks. Human embryonic lungs were dissected into 1- to 2-mm pieces and cul-
tured in Transwells in Matrigel (BD Bioscience) in the presence of 60 ng/well of active ADAM33 Pro-MP 
or inactive mutant E346A ADAM33 Pro-MP for 12 days, replenishing media and ADAM33 protein every 
second day as previously described (27). The tissue was harvested and processed for immunohistochemis-
try at day 12.
Mice. The animals were maintained in a pathogen-free environment. Food and water were provided 
ad libitum in temperature-controlled rooms on a 14 -hour light/10-hour dark cycle. Animals of mixed sex 
were used for experiments.
A pTRES-hADAM33-SS-PRO-MP-3Flag plasmid (human ADAM33 NCBI reference sequence: 
NM_025220.3) was generated as demonstrated in Supplemental Figure 4, A–G. The plasmid was digested 
with the restriction endonucleases AatII and SapI to obtain a linearized construct (Supplemental Figure 
4F). This was purified and used for microinjection into pronuclei from FVB/N mice in the Transgenic 
Animal and Genome Editing Core Facility at the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center. DNA 
was extracted from tails or ear tips of weanlings and used for PCR-based genotyping in order to find 
ADAM33-expressing founder mice (Supplemental Figure 4H). Founder mice were bred with Ccsp-rtTA (line 
2) (33) to generate DTg Ccsp/ADAM33 and STg littermate control mice that were used for phenotyping.
Expression of ADAM33 was induced in 6- to 8-week-old DTg (Ccsp/ADAM33) mice by provision of 
Dox (Lab Diet, 5LOS W/625 ppm Dox; TestDiet) in the food ad libitum for 4 and 8 weeks until the point 
of sacrifice. STg litter controls were fed Dox for the same time period (Supplemental Figure 5A).
Ccsp/ADAM33 pregnant dams were given Dox in their diet during pregnancy and weaning; Dox was 
also given to their offspring until 4 weeks after birth. DTg Ccsp/ADAM33 and STg littermate control off-
spring were sacrificed at ED17.5, PD10, and PD28 for further analysis (Supplemental Figure 5D).
For studies of the reversibility of airway remodeling, Ccsp/ADAM33 pregnant dams were given Dox in 
their diet during pregnancy and weaning and their offspring were given Dox until PD28 and PD56. One group 
was given Dox for 28 days and then was fed without Dox for another 28 days. DTg Ccsp/ADAM33 and STg 
littermate control offspring were sacrificed PD28 and PD56 for further analysis (Supplemental Figure 10A).
For the ADAM33 knockout experiments, sperm were obtained from the Mouse Biology Program at 
the University of California, Davis (a gift from Dean Sheppard and Chun Chen, Lung Biology Center,

Department of Medicine, University of California) (35). This was used for in vitro fertilization to reconsti-
tute Adam33–/– mice in the Transgenic Animal and Genome Editing Core facility at Cincinnati Children’s 
Hospital Medical Center. Sperm from homozygote Adam33–/– 129/SVJae mice were added to oocyte-cu-
mulus complexes from superovulated FVB/N female mice for in vitro fertilization. Mixed background 
Adam33+/– mice were bred in order to generate a mix of Adam33–/–, Adam33+/-, and WT mice, which were 
genotyped as previously reported (35). Six- to eight-week-old offspring of mixed sex were used for the 
HDM extract challenge experiments according to the protocol described below (Supplemental Figure 3). 
The number of animals used for analysis was based on 3–5 animals per treatment group, and each experi-
ment was repeated up to 3 times. This was based on power calculations (http://www.stat.ubc.ca) for inva-
sive airway resistance measurements from a pilot experiment of Adam33–/– and WT mice challenged with 
HDM. Assuming an 80% power, a 5% significance level, a 2-sided test, a common SD of 1.0–1.5, and 
that a difference in the mean airway resistance of 2.2–3.3 cm H2O/s/ml between DTg and control mice 
is likely to be of scientific interest, we estimated that sample sizes of about 2 to 8 mice would be required 
when testing concentrations of methacholine at 0, 25, 50, and 100 mg/ml.
Genotyping was performed before litters were weaned and split by gender. At the same time, ani-
mals were tagged with a metal clip or ear punches and given each a unique number. Animals with the 
appropriate genotypes were randomly included in the different experimental groups. The investigators 
were blinded during further analysis of the animals and processed samples using only the unique iden-
tification number.
Genotyping PCR. Primers used for PCR amplification of the conditional Ccsp/ADAM33 mice were as 
follows: ADAM33-PRO-MP forward 5′-CAGCTTCTCAGGACTCTGGACATTC-3′ and reverse 5′-CGG-
GATCACTACTTGTCATCGTC-3′. About 100 ng of genomic DNA was PCR amplified using the fol-
lowing conditions: Ccsp — 94°C for 5 minutes, 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, 57°C for 30 seconds, 
and 72°C for 30 seconds, 72°C for 7 minutes, and hold at 4°C; ADAM33-PRO-MP — 94°C for 5 minutes, 
30 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, 55°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 30 seconds, 72°C for 7 minutes, and 
hold at 4°C. We analyzed the PCR products on 1.5% agarose gel with ethidium bromide to examine the 
presence of the approximately 440-bp Ccsp and approximately 636-bp ADAM33-PRO-MP allele band. 
For genotyping of the Adam33 mutant alleles, primers and conditions were used that had been described 
previously (35).
IL-13 and HDM allergen challenges. Six- to eight-week-old DTg Ccsp/ADAM33 and STg littermate con-
trol mice were challenged with 5 μg of recombinant murine IL-13 or saline by intratracheal installation, 
and lungs were harvested for further analysis after 24 hours (Supplemental Figure 8A). Six- to eight-week-
old age- and gender-matched FVB/N, Adam33-null, heterozygote and WT mice and DTg Ccsp/ADAM33 
and STg littermate control mice were sensitized intraperitoneally with HDM extract (Dermatophagoides 
pteronyssinus extract protein 8.1 mg/vial, lot 218862; Greer) (10 μg/200 μl saline) on days 0 and 7. On 
days 14 and 19 the mice were challenged intratracheally with 25 μg HDM/100 μl saline to induce allergic 
airway inflammation or with saline alone as control (Supplemental Figure 3). In addition, a dose response 
experiment was performed with lower concentrations of HDM (6.25, 12.5, and 25 μg/100 μl saline) on 
days 14 and 19 in WT mice, and the lowest dose was used for DTg Ccsp/ADAM33 and STg littermate 
control mice that had been on Dox starting in utero (Supplemental Figure 9A). At day 21 after first sen-
sitization, lung function was assessed (see below) and mice were harvested for BALF and lung tissue for 
further analysis (Supplemental Figure 3).
Western blotting. Human or murine BALF (from HDM-challenged mice) samples were concentrated 
and diluted using 2× or 6× Laemmli sample buffer before loading equal protein concentrations on to the 
gels. Samples were run on 10% Tris/glycine gels and transferred onto PVDF membranes. Where murine 
BALF samples were not concentrated, equal volumes of BALF were subjected to electrophoresis and 
transferred onto PVDF membranes. The transferred protein was assessed by Ponceau staining to ensure 
similar protein loading prior to blocking and Western blotting. Membranes were probed with polyclon-
al rabbit antibodies against the MP (ab39191, Abcam; 1:5,000) or the Pro (ab39190, Abcam; 1:5,000) 
domains of ADAM33 (Supplemental Figure 1) or a polyclonal goat antibody against the ectodomain of 
mouse ADAM33 (AF2434, R&D Systems; 1:1,000) as described previously (26, 28). Secondary antibod-
ies were rabbit TrueBlot anti-rabbit IgG HRP antibody (18-8816, eBioscience; 1: 5,000) or rabbit anti-goat 
IgG HRP antibody (Calbiochem, Merck; 1:10,000). The blots were visualized using enhanced chemilumi-
nescence (ECL+; GE Healthcare) with ImageQuant LS4000 or Amersham Imager 600 (GE Healthcare

Life Sciences, Little Chalfont, UK). Semiquantitative analysis was performed by densitometry. Quantity 
One Analysis software (Bio-Rad) or ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, USA) was used to determine 
the intensity of the bands by measuring the integrated density as a product of area and mean gray value or 
by measuring relative density as result of the area of the lane profile plot (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/docs/
menus/analyze.html#gels). All human and mouse BALF samples were run on the same gel with positive 
control samples in form of Cos-7 cell lysates transfected with human ADAM33-MP-Pro and purified 
human recombinant ADAM33-MP-Pro protein or Cos-7 cell lysates transfected with full-length mouse 
ADAM33 (Mouse cDNA clone MR217277-20; OriGene) on each gel.
Specificity testing of  the human ADAM33 antibodies. Human recombinant ADAM33-Pro-MP (produced 
in-house) and ADAM8-polyhistidine-tag (HIS) and ADAM12-polyhistidine-tag (HIS) (1031-AD-020 and 
4416-AD-020; both from R&D Systems, BioTechne) were applied in 2-μl volumes containing 100, 75, 
50, 25, or 0 ng of each protein onto pencil marked grids on PVDF membranes and air dried. After block-
ing, the membranes were incubated overnight with the polyclonal rabbit antibodies against the MP or Pro 
domains of ADAM33 (ab39191 and ab39190, Abcam; 1:5,000) or with mouse anti-HIS antibody (372900, 
GE Healthcare). After washing, bound antibody was detected using secondary antibodies: donkey anti-rab-
bit IgG HRP (NA9340V
, GE Healthcare) or polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse HRP (P0260, Dako) and visu-
alized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL+; GE Healthcare) with an Amersham Imager 600 (GE 
Healthcare Life Sciences) (Supplemental Figure 2).
FRET peptide cleavage assay. A FRET peptide cleavage assay was performed using a peptide that was 
selective for ADAM33. Analyses were performed using a StepOnePlus (Applied Biosystems, Life Tech-
nologies) or a Bio-Rad CFX96 (Bio-Rad) qPCR machine with a FAM (6-carboxyfluorescein) filter that 
measured fluorescence output every minute for 60 minutes. To assess enzymatic activity in BALF, each 
reaction was incubated with 7 μl of neat BALF at 37°C with 4.4 μM (0.5 μl of 88.7 μM) FRET peptide 
[DABCYL-YRVAFQKLAE(FAM)K-NH2] (41) (Severn Biotech) and 10 μM (0.5 μl of 200 μM) ZnCl2 
in 2 μl of 5× assay buffer (100 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 2.5 M NaCl, 50 mM CaCl2, and 1 mg/ml bovine 
serum albumin) in a total reaction volume of 10 μl. Enzymatic activity was determined by plotting the 
relative fluorescence units (RFU) against time after the background had been subtracted. The rate of 
the reaction (RFU/min) was determined from the line of best fit in the linear phase of the assay. Con-
trols were recombinant soluble active ADAM33-PRO-MP and mutant ADAM33-PRO-MP (E356A) as 
previously published (27).
qRT-PCR. Lung tissue was either snap frozen or stored in RNAlater (Life Technologies) before homog-
enization and RNA extraction using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen, Life Technologies). Genomic DNA con-
tamination was removed by digestion with DNase (Life Technologies). First-strand cDNA was generated 
by reverse transcription using the RT-Standard cDNA synthesis kit (PrimerDesign). qPCR was performed 
using a CFX96 qPCR machine (Bio-Rad) for 40 cycles at 95°C for 5 seconds and 60°C for 20 seconds 
(fast protocol) or 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 seconds and 60°C for 60 seconds (standard protocol) followed 
by a melt curve analysis for SYBR green–based assays. All samples were run in duplicate. PCR prod-
uct amplification was detected using PCR or SYBR green mastermix (PrimerDesign) or TaqMan Gene 
Expression Master Mix (Life Technologies) and primer sets without or with TaqMan/Perfect probes: 
ADAM33-MP forward 5′-CCTGGAACTGTACATTGTGGCA-3′, reverse 5′-GTCCACGTAGTTGGC-

ative mRNA expression was quantified using 2–ΔΔCt method (46).
Luminex multiplex analysis. Undiluted murine BALF samples were analyzed using a mouse Magnetic 
Luminex Screening assay containing a premixed multi-analyte kit for murine Ccl11 and IL-5 according to 
manufacturer instructions (R&D Systems) on a Luminex 200 (Luminex).

Inflammatory cell counts. Murine BALF samples were collected by washing the lungs 3 times with 800–
1,000 μl sterile PBS (PBS). The total volume of the combined fluids was measured and centrifuged at 300 
g for 5 minutes. The BALF supernatants were frozen for analysis of sADAM33. Red blood cells were lysed 
from the cell pellets, which were subsequently resuspended in 300 μl PBS. Cells were counted, and 100,000 
cells were loaded into a cytospin funnel and centrifuged at 300 g for 5 minutes on to a glass slide. Slides 
were air dried, and the cells were stained using a Diff-Quick stain (Sigma-Aldrich) followed by fixation and 
H&E staining. The different inflammatory cell types were counted to a total of 300 cells and expressed as 
the differential cell count in cells/ml BALF.
Assessment of  lung function. Mice were anesthetized with 100 μl of triple anesthetic containing a 4:1:1 
mixture of ketamine, acepromazine, and xylazine by intraperitoneal injection. A FlexiVent machine 
(Scireq) was used to assess lung function in the form of airway resistance (R) after aerosolized methacho-
line challenge to provide a measure of BHR, as described by the manufacturer’s instructions. Airway resis-
tance was measured by forced oscillation technique, with increasing values indicating bronchoconstriction 
of the lungs. BHR measurements were obtained from individual animals using increasing stepwise concen-
trations of 0, 25, 50 and 100 mg/ml methacholine in saline for the Ccsp/ADAM33 and HDM extract–chal-
lenged mice. On completion of lung function assessment, mice were sacrificed and BALF and lung tissue 
were collected for further analyses.
Histochemistry and immunofluorescence-histochemistry. Lungs were inflation-fixed with 4% paraformal-
dehyde or 10% neutral buffered formalin at 25 cm of water pressure for 5 minutes and then fixed over-
night before embedding in paraffin wax. Five-μm-thick serial sections were cut for histological staining 
using H&E or immunofluorescence-histochemistry using standard protocols. We used a FITC-conju-
gated mouse monoclonal antibody against ACTA2 (αSMA), 1:250 (F3777; Sigma-Aldrich); a prima-
ry rabbit anti-human ADAM33-PRO, 1:1,000 (ab39190, Abcam), with a secondary Alexa Fluor 594 
goat anti-rabbit IgG, 1:200 (Invitrogen); and a primary rat antibody against murine CD31 (PECAM1), 
1:75 (DIA 310; Dianova, Stratech Scientific Ltd.), with a secondary Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-rat IgG, 
1:500 (112-605-003; Jackson Immune Research, Stratech Scientific Ltd). Stained slides were mounted 
with a cover slip in ProLong Anti-Fade Gold (Life Technologies), which contained DAPI as nuclear 
counterstain. Human embryonic lungs were acetone-fixed and embedded in glycol methacrylate resin. 
Consecutive 2-μm sections were cut and immunostained with a mouse monoclonal antibody against 
ACTA2 (αSMA), 1:40,000 (A2547, Sigma-Aldrich) using standard protocols (21, 47). Lung sections 
were examined by light microscopy using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 (Carl Zeiss Microscopy) or a Leica AF6000 
LX (Leica Microsystems) microscope equipped with AxioVision software (Zeiss) or LAS AF software 
(Leica Microsystems).
Statistics. Normal distribution of the numeric data was evaluated, and the appropriate parametric or 
nonparametric statistical tests were used. Statistical significance was assessed by using the 2-tailed Stu-
dent’s t test (parametric, unpaired data) with Welch’s correction if SDs were not equal or Mann Whit-
ney test (nonparametric, unpaired data) for comparisons between 2 groups. For comparison of 3 or more 
groups a 1-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test (parametric data) or Kruskal-Wallis test 
with Dunn’s test for correction for multiple comparisons (nonparametric data) was used. For comparison 
of 2 or more groups with 2 independent variables, a 2-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test 
was used (Prism 6, version 6.0e, Graphpad). P values of less than or equal to 0.05 were considered signif-
icant. Data are presented as mean ± SD or median with 25% and 75% interquartiles, with all data points 
shown. Whiskers represent minimum and maximum values.
Study approval. Collection of bronchoscopy samples was performed after approval from the South-
ampton and South West Hampshire Joint Local Research Ethics Committee and after informed consent 
was obtained from the donors. Human embryonic lungs were harvested according to the Polkinghorne 
Committee guidelines after approval from the Southampton and South West Hampshire Joint Local 
Research Ethics Committee and obtaining informed consent from the donor. For all mouse experi-
ments, the 3R (Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement) principles were followed and experiments 
were conducted according to the Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) 
guidelines (48), the guidelines for the care and use of animals approved by the Institutional Animal 
Care and Use Committee at the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Research Foundation (Cincinnati, Ohio, 
USA), and the local Southampton University ethical committee under project and personal licenses 
from the Home Office, United Kingdom.
