IMPORTANCE Identifying patients at risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression may
facilitate more optimal nephrology care. Kidney failure risk equations were previously
developed and validated in 2 Canadian cohorts. Validation in other regions and in CKD
populations not under the care of a nephrologist is needed.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the accuracy of the risk equations across different geographic regions
and patient populations through individual participant data meta-analysis.
DATA SOURCES Thirty-one cohorts, including 721 357 participants with CKD stages 3 to 5
in more than 30 countries spanning 4 continents, were studied. These cohorts collected data
from 1982 through 2014.
STUDY SELECTION Cohorts participating in the CKD Prognosis Consortium with data on
end-stage renal disease.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data were obtained and statistical analyses were
performed between July 2012 and June 2015. Using the risk factors from the original
risk equations, cohort-specific hazard ratios were estimated and combined in meta-analysis
to form new pooled kidney failure risk equations. Original and pooled kidney failure
risk equation performance was compared, and the need for regional calibration factors
was assessed.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Kidney failure (treatment by dialysis or kidney transplant).
RESULTS During a median follow-up of 4 years, 23 829 cases of kidney failure were observed.
The original risk equations achieved excellent discrimination (ability to differentiate those
who developed kidney failure from those who did not) across all cohorts (overall C statistic,
0.90; 95% CI, 0.89-0.92 at 2 years; C statistic, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.86-0.90 at 5 years);
discrimination in subgroups by age, race, and diabetes status was similar. There was no
improvement with the pooled equations. Calibration (the difference between observed and
predicted risk) was adequate in North American cohorts, but the original risk equations
overestimated risk in some non-North American cohorts. Addition of a calibration factor that
lowered the baseline risk by 32.9% at 2 years and 16.5% at 5 years improved the calibration in
12 of 15 and 10 of 13 non-North American cohorts at 2 and 5 years, respectively (P = .04 and
P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Kidney failure risk equations developed in a Canadian
population showed high discrimination and adequate calibration when validated
in 31 multinational cohorts. However, in some regions the addition of a calibration factor
may be necessary.

C
hronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing in incidence
and prevalence worldwide.1 Rates of progression to
kidney failure varies among individuals with CKD and
depends on the severity of kidney disease, comorbid condi-
tions, and risk of dying before kidney failure onset.2,3 Inter-
ventions to slow CKD progression, planning for initiation of
dialysis and transplant, and early creation of arteriovenous
fistula have been advocated, but these strategies may be
expensive and are associated with risks. Treatment would
ideally be recommended only for patients at high risk of pro-
gression and for whom the benefit exceeds the harm.4,5
Tangri et al6 previously developed kidney failure risk
equations that use demographic and laboratory data to
predict progression of CKD to kidney failure. The risk equa-
tions were developed in 3449 patients with stages 3 to 5
CKD who were referred for nephrology care in Ontario,
Canada, and were validated in referred patients with CKD in
British Columbia, Canada. The preferred risk equations (the
4-variable and 8-variable equations) are age-, sex-, and labo-
ratory value–based, thereby enabling automated risk report-
ing whenever laboratory tests are performed.7 The 4-variable
equation requires age, sex, estimated glomerular filtration
rate (eGFR), and urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR),
facilitating integration into clinical practice.
The kidney failure risk equations are widely used
through electronic applications (eg, http://www.qxmd.com
/calculate-online/nephrology/kidney-failure-risk-equation),
with some initial validation in other countries and health
care systems.7-12 However, widespread adoption of the risk
equations requires validation in additional populations
including nonwhite ethnicities, patients not under nephrol-
ogy care, and cohorts outside North America. Their accu-
racy in different geographic regions and patient populations
is evaluated herein.
Methods
Participating Cohorts
Thirty-one cohorts participating in the Chronic Kidney Dis-
ease Prognosis Consortium (CKD-PC) were selected for
validation based on data availability.13 The CKD-PC is a col-
laborative research group integrating data from more than
50 cohorts spanning 40 countries and involving 2 million
individuals.13 The diverse cohorts include populations across
a wide range of baseline risk of kidney failure. For the pur-
pose of this analysis, cohorts were selected to include
patients with stages 3 to 5 CKD with an estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and an
absence of kidney failure at baseline who had follow-up
information on kidney failure, defined as treatment by dialy-
sis or a kidney transplant. Data transfer and analysis took
place between July 2012 and June 2015. Data in included
cohorts were collected from September 1982 through Octo-
ber 2014. This study was approved for use of deidentified
data by the institutional review board at the Johns Hopkins
Bloomberg School of Public Health, and the need for
informed consent was waived.
Measurement of Variables in Cohorts
As in the original kidney failure risk equationss, GFR was
estimated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology
Collaboration (CKD-EPI) 2009 creatinine equation.14 Serum
creatinine concentrations were standardized to isotope dilu-
tion mass spectrometry–traceable methods where possible.14
For studies in which creatinine measurements were not stan-
dardized to isotope dilution mass spectrometry, the creati-
nine levels were reduced by 5%, as previously reported.15,16
Albuminuria was represented as a log-transformed urine
ACR. Alternative measures of urine protein excretion (protein
to creatinine ratio, 24-hour urine collection, urinary dipstick)
were transformed to the ACR using previously developed
equations.6,17,18 When available, baseline values for serum
albumin, phosphorous, calcium, and bicarbonate, as well as
physical examination measures of weight, systolic and dia-
stolic blood pressure, were derived from each cohort. Age,
sex, and ethnicity (black or nonblack), as well as the presence
of diabetes and hypertension, were also derived from the
individual cohorts, with information on race collected as part
of routine clinical care for the health systems and as demo-
graphic data for the study cohorts. Diabetes was defined as
fasting glucose of at least 126.1 mg/dL (to convert glucose to
mmol/L, multiply by 0.0555), nonfasting glucose of at least
200 mg/dL or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of at least 6.5%,
use of glucose-lowering drugs, or self-reported diabetes.
Hypertensionwasdefinedasasystolicbloodpressureofatleast
140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure of at least 90 mm Hg,
or use of antihypertensive drugs for treatment of hyperten-
sion. Potential participants missing any baseline data were
excluded from analysis. Information on individual cohorts is
provided in eAppendix 1 in the Supplement.
Statistical Analysis
There were 4 kidney failure risk equations developed
in the original cohorts: the 3-variable (age, sex, and
eGFR), the 4-variable (3-variable + ACR), the 6-variable
(4-variable + diabetes and hypertension), and the 8-variable
equations (4-variable + calcium, phosphate, bicarbonate, and
albumin). The 4-variable and 8-variable equations demon-
strated the best performance in the original cohorts; thus, the
focus of this validation effort centered on the 4-variable and
8-variable equations.
Participant-level data were analyzed for each individual
cohort. Meta-analysis was performed across studies using a
random-effects model. Risk relationships observed in the
original cohorts were compared with those seen in the vali-
dation cohorts. Cox proportional hazards models were fit
using the variables included in each of the original equations
within each study, allowing both the regression coefficients
and the baseline hazard to vary. All variables were centered
(age, 70 years; 56% men, eGFR, 36 mL/min/1.73 m2; ACR,
170 mg/g; phosphate, 3.9 mg/dL; albumin, 4.0 g/dL; bicar-
bonate, 25.6 mEq/L; and calcium, 9.4 mg/dL; to convert cal-
cium to mmol/L, multiply by 0.25), as per the original study.6
The refit coefficients were then pooled across studies using
random-effects meta-analysis. Pooled and original coeffi-
cients were compared using the z test.19

A set of pooled risk equations were developed to com-
pare with the original risk equations. Pooled coefficients from
the random-effects meta-analysis were combined with a
pooled baseline hazard, defined as the average refit baseline
hazard weighted by the number of kidney failure events.
Discrimination of the original and pooled kidney failure
risk equations was assessed using the Harrell C statistic within
each study, which was then meta-analyzed using random-
effects models. Performance was also evaluated in predeter-
mined subgroups of black or non-black race, presence or ab-
sence of diabetes mellitus, and age older or younger than 65
years. The discrimination of the original and pooled risk equa-
tions was compared by assessing the meta-analyzed differ-
ence in the C statistic within individual studies. Finally, within
each set of original and pooled risk equations, the discrimi-
nation of the 4- vs 6- and 4- vs 8-variable risk equations was
comparedbymeta-analyzingthedifferenceinindividualstudy
C statistics (6-variable performance is reported in the supple-
mentary materials).
Calibration (the difference between observed and pre-
dicted risk) was examined by plotting the observed 2-year
and 5-year probability of kidney failure in individual cohorts
and comparing it to the predicted risk using the original and
pooled risk equations. This was done in 5 risk categories (for
2 years, 0% to <2%, 2% to <6%, 6% to <10%, 10% to <20%,
and ≥20%; for 5 years, 0% to <5%, 5% to <15%, 15% to <25%,
25% to <50%, and ≥50%). In the absence of clinical practice
guidelines that recommend risk cut-offs or strata for CKD
progression, the risk categories used were adopted from the
original development study and subsequent CKD-PC
publications.6 Calibration varied across cohorts; thus, factors
that might explain heterogeneity in baseline risk were inves-
tigated by regressing cohort-specific baseline risk on cohort
characteristics (eg, region of cohort, mean eGFR, proportion
of the cohort with black race, diabetes mellitus, and hyper-
tension). Baseline risk was estimated for each cohort using
Cox proportional hazards models, holding the variable coeffi-
cients constant and equal to the original risk equations
regression coefficients but allowing the intercept to vary. The
only cohort characteristic associated with cohort-specific
baseline hazard was region of cohort, with higher baseline
risk in North American cohorts compared with non-North
American cohorts.
Regional variation in baseline risk was addressed through
the development of 2 regional calibration factors (North
America and non-North America). The regional calibration fac-
tors were developed as the ratio of the event-weighted re-
gional mean to the original baseline hazard. A Brier score, the
squared difference between the observed vs predicted binary
outcomes (observed minus predicted risk), was used to evalu-
ate whether calibration improved with the “regional-
calibrated original” risk equations, in each study.20 The
Wilcoxon sign-rank test was used to evaluate the differences
in Brier score between original and regional-calibrated origi-
nal risk equations. An overall Brier score was calculated using
event-weighted means. The square root of this overall score
was reported as the root-mean-squared error between ob-
served and predicted risk. A P value <.05 was considered
statisticallysignificant.Alltestswere2-sided.Allanalyseswere
performed using Stata MP 13 (StataCorp).
Results
There were 721 357 CKD patients and 23 829 kidney failure
events in 31 cohorts with an average follow-up time of 4.2
years (Table 1). A total of 16 cohorts (617 604 patients) were
based in North America, and 15 cohorts (103 753 patients)
were from Asia, Europe, and Australasia. Missing data varied
by cohort (median of 0% for the 4-, 1% for the 6-, and 41% for
the 8-variable equations; eAppendix 1 in the Supplement).
The amount of missing data was higher in North American
cohorts (median missing of 2% for the 4-, 3% for the 6-, and
79% for the 8-variableequations) than in non-North Ameri-
can cohorts (median missing of 0% for the 4-, 1% for the 6-,
and 9% for the 8-variable equations). All 31 cohorts had the
variables necessary to validate the 4-variable, 29 cohorts had
the variables necessary to validate the 6-variable, and 16
cohorts had the variables necessary to validate the 8-variable
equations.
The mean age of the study population was 74 years, and
the mean baseline eGFR was 46 mL/min/1.73 m2. Cohorts
ranged from being predominantly men (Veterans Administra-
tion CKD, 97%) to majority women (Okinawa 83, 75%). Forty
percent of the patients had diabetes, and 84% had hyperten-
sion (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Forty percent of the study
participants had a baseline urinary ACR of 30 mg/g or greater.

person-years in the Pima Indian cohort. According to the origi-
nal 4-variable equation, the proportion of each cohort that had
a more than 20% 2-year predicted probability of kidney fail-
ure ranged from 0.23% (Okinawa 93 cohort) to 50% (Chronic
Renal Impairment in Birmingham cohort).
Variable Coefficients in the Original
and Pooled Kidney Failure Risk Equation
In general, coefficients for the association between different
characteristics (eg, age, sex, eGFR, ACR) and the risk of kidney
failure were similar in the original and pooled equations
(Table 2). Exceptions were eGFR in the 4-variable equations
(originalvspooled:HR,0.57vs0.63per5mL/min/1.73m2higher
eGFR) and serum bicarbonate in the 8-variable equations (0.93
vs 0.99 per 1 mEq/L higher serum bicarbonate), both of which
were stronger in the original kidney failure risk equation.
Discrimination
Measuresofdiscriminationfortheoriginal4-variableriskequa-
tion were excellent for the 2-year and 5-year predicted prob-
ability of kidney failure (Figure 1 and Figure 2). Overall, the
4-variable equation had a pooled C statistic of 0.90 (95% CI,
0.89-0.92) at 2 years, and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.86-0.90) at 5 years.
Within individual cohorts, discrimination was also excellent,
with a C statistic of at least 0.80 in all but 2 cohorts; the MMKD
(Mild to Moderate Kidney Disease) study 2-year C statistic was
0.79 (95% CI, 0.72-0.87) and the MASTERPLAN (Multifacto-
rial Approach and Superior Treatment Efficacy in Renal Pa-
tients with the Aid of a Nurse Practitioner) study 5-year C sta-
tistic was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.73-0.81). Discrimination for the
original 8-variable risk equation was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.88-0.91)
at 2 years and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.84-0.87) at 5 years (eFigure 1 in
the Supplement). In prespecified subgroups of age, sex, race,
region, and diabetes status, discrimination was qualitatively
unchanged, with C statistics for the 4-variable equation rang-
ing from 0.90 to 0.92 for 2 years and 0.87 to 0.89 for 5 years
(Figure 3). Similar statistics for the 6-variable equation are
shown in eFigure 2 in the Supplement.
In general, the pooled 4- and 8-variable equations re-
sulted in similar discrimination to the original equations
(eTables 2-7 in the Supplement). There was no significant dif-
ference in the overall C statistics of the pooled and the origi-
nal kidney failure risk equations (eg, 4-variable risk equation
over 2 years: −0.0006; 95% CI, −0.0020 to 0.0008). When

2-year risk in all 31 cohorts was assessed individually, the
pooled4-variableequationperformedsignificantlybetterthan
the original 4-variable equation in 5 cohorts, and in 5 cohorts
it performed significantly worse (P < .05 for each comparison).
Discrimination of the 8-variable risk equation was slightly
better than the 4-variable equation in cohorts that had the nec-
essary components for both equations (eTables 8 and 9 in the
Supplement). This was true using either the original or the
pooled risk equations and in nearly all subgroups of interest.
Calibration
Plots of the observed vs predicted risk demonstrated differ-
ences in calibration, with suboptimal performance in some of
the non-North American cohorts (eFigures 3-6 for the North
American cohorts; eFigures 7-10 for the non-North American
cohorts, both in the Supplement). Baseline risk varied by
region, with higher levels in North America compared with
non-North America using the 4-variable equation (Figure 4).
There was slightly less variation in baseline risk by region
using the 8-variable equation (eFigure 11 in the Supplement).
In non-North American studies, use of a regional calibration
factor that lowered the baseline risk by 32.9% at 2 years and
16.5% at 5 years decreased the root mean-squared distance of
the observed to expected risk from 0.237 to 0.228 at 2 years
and 0.299 to 0.287 at 5 years for the 4-variable equation and
improved performance in 12 out of 15 studies at 2 years
(P = .04) and 10 out of 13 studies at 5 years (P = .02) (eTable
10 in the Supplement). In contrast, use of a regional calibra-
tion factor in North American cohorts, the region where the
kidney failure risk equations were developed, did not signifi-
cantly improve performance. For example, the root mean-
squared distance of the observed to expected risk at 2 years
only minimally changed from 0.152 to 0.151 with the addition
of the calibration factor and increased from 0.264 to 0.272 at
5 years for the 4-variable equation. eAppendix 2 in the
Supplement shows all equations.
Discussion
In this collaborative meta-analysis involving 721 357 patients
across 31 cohorts and over 30 countries, the kidney failure risk
equations accurately predict the 2-year and 5-year probabil-
ity of kidney failure in patients with CKD with a wide range of
variation in age, sex, race, and in the presence or absence of
diabetes.
The original equations reported by Tangri et al6 demon-
strated excellent discrimination and appropriate calibration in
the majority of the North American cohorts, and the addition
of a recalibration factor optimized performance in non-North
Americanpopulations.The4-variableequation(age,sex,eGFR,
and albuminuria) can be easily implemented in electronic

medical records and laboratory information systems. The use
of this equation is consistent with the Kidney Disease Improv-
ing Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline, which recommends
integration of risk prediction in the evaluation and manage-
ment of CKD21 and is in agreement with a strong body of evi-
dence demonstrating the importance of eGFR and albumin-
uria in predicting prognosis.13,15,22-35
Previous investigators developed alternative risk predic-
tion models for progression of CKD to kidney failure,36 but
most have not been externally validated. The kidney failure
risk equations developed by Tangri et al6 were externally
validated in a cohort of Canadian CKD patients referred for
nephrology care, but their accuracy in nonreferred patients
and regions outside Canada remained unknown. Thus, cur-
rent clinical practice guidelines recommended the use of
risk equations for predicting prognosis and planning dialysis
access, but with appropriate caution regarding their external
validity.37 The current validation study addresses these
concerns, and more widespread clinical assessment can
now be recommended. Similar to previous work, an incre-
mental improvement in performance was observed with an
8-variable risk equation, which additionally includes serum
albumin, phosphate, bicarbonate, and calcium levels over
the 4-variable equation. The magnitude of improvement was
smaller than in the original study but may be meaningful for
patients for whom data for both equations is readily avail-
able. These findings suggest that the 4-variable risk equation
might be adopted more widely, but the 8-variable equation
should be made available if the additional variables are
obtained and increased precision is desired.
The risk associations observed in the pooled validation
sample were similar to those in the original kidney failure risk
equation.Inparticular,youngerage,malesex,lowereGFR,and
higher albuminuria were associated with a higher risk of
kidney failure defined by treatment with dialysis or trans-
plant. The finding of lower risk of kidney failure with older age
is consistent with the previous literature25 and is likely due to
a combination of factors: 1) the same disease process (eg, dia-
betic nephropathy in a patient with type 1 diabetes with age
of diagnosis at 15 years) is more likely to be indolent, if the pa-
tienthasaneGFRof30mL/min/1.73m2atage75years(60years
of exposure) vs age 45 years (30 years of exposure); 2) as pa-
tients age, they are more likely to die from a competing cause
(malignancy, cardiovascular disease) than reach kidney fail-
ure; and 3) older patients may be more likely to choose con-
servative care for kidney failure rather than treatment with di-
alysis or transplant, our primary outcome.38 It is important to
note that in the original development of the risk equation,6

come; no differences in the performance of the kidney failure
risk equations was observed.
Although recalibration was not needed in most North
American cohorts, adding a regional calibration factor in
non-North American cohorts improved calibration and would
allow the risk equations to be used clinically in countries with
different levels of baseline risk. This is similar to the Framing-
ham Heart Study equation, which is used for estimating car-
diovascular risk and has been recalibrated for use in multiple
different populations.19 Differences in baseline risk between
cohorts and regions may reflect different cohort inclusion cri-
teria or treatment preferences for kidney failure rather than
physiological differences in disease progression because risk
relationships between the risk factors and kidney failure were
fairly uniform across settings. Further studies examining ad-
ditional causes of heterogeneity in higher- vs lower-risk popu-
lations are needed.
There are important clinical and research implications
to this study’
s findings. Clinicians can now use the 4- or
8-variable kidney failure risk equations, with the recalibra-
tion factor where applicable, that can inform patient-
clinician communication and treatment decisions regarding
the absolute risk of kidney failure, rather than the CKD stage
alone. Decisions regarding access placement or transplant
referral could be made once kidney failure risk thresholds are
exceeded. Some kidney failure risk thresholds have been pro-
posed on the basis of physician surveys and decision analy-
ses (>3% or 5% risk for 5 years for nephrology referral, >20%
or 40% risk over 2 years for vascular access planning), and
should be evaluated further in cluster randomized trials or
time series analyses. Routine reporting and clinical imple-
mentation is already under way in several centers, and its
effect on patient care and health services is being studied.
From a research perspective, the risk equation can be used to
estimate event rates and statistical power for kidney failure
outcomes in clinical trials and may be useful in selecting
higher-risk patients for trial inclusion and identifying risk-
treatment interactions.39,40
This study has limitations. First, the risk equation does not
assess kidney failure risk in patients with CKD stages G1
(GFR ≥90 mL/min/1.73m2) and G2 (GFR 60-89 mL/min/
1.73m2). Previous studies have shown that patients with stages
G1 to G2 and high levels of albuminuria should be considered
as high risk. Second, due to the variables required, validation
ofthe8-variableequationwasnotpossibleinallcohorts.There-
fore, nested comparisons between equations are limited to a
subset. In some cohorts, proteinuria was converted to albu-
minuria. Although no meaningful differences in discrimina-
tion were observed in these populations, it is possible that risk
relationships may differ slightly for the 2 measures. Further-
more, even with the inclusion of more than 700 000 partici-
pants in more than 30 countries, there was not significant rep-
resentationfromcountrieswherethereislimitedaccesstorenal
replacement therapy. Validation in these countries with a com-
bined end point of treated and untreated kidney failure should
be performed. Third, there were missing data, particularly in
the North American health systems. Missing data reduce the
generalizability of our findings to North American health sys-

36 mL/min/1.73 m2; urine albumin to creatinine ratio, 170 mg/g); the orange
and blue horizontal lines represent the weighted mean refit baseline hazard
within each region (North America and non-North America). The 25 cohorts
included represent studies with available urine albumin to creatinine ratio.
Studies with dipstick proteinuria were not included in the calculation.

tems. However, results reflect data available in clinical health
systems. Fourth, the risk equations provide the risk of kidney
failure over 2 and 5 years. These time frames are important for
decisions regarding nephrology referral, dialysis access plan-
ning, and preemptive transplant (ie, kidney transplant prior
to receiving dialysis), but they do not capture longer-term risk
ofkidneyfailure,whichmayaffectotherclinicaldecisionssuch
as lifestyle modification.41 Fifth, the kidney failure risk equa-
tion incorporates routinely collected laboratory data. Accu-
racy of risk predictions may be enhanced in specific subpopu-
lations by novel biomarkers of CKD; however, the incremental
gain in predictive accuracy may not be justified by the cost of
thesenewerassaysfortheentireCKDpopulation.42Sixth,there
is no evidence that using the equation will improve out-
comes. Well-designed pragmatic randomized trials are needed
to definitively establish the evidence for efficacy.
Strengths of this study include the large patient popula-
tion and accompanying diversity in age, sex, race, and etiol-
ogy of kidney disease. In North America, the 4-variable origi-
nal risk equation appears generalizable and highly accurate in
most cohorts and can be easily implemented across multiple
health care systems. Elsewhere, the recalibrated risk equa-
tion appears more accurate and can also be integrated into
healthcareplatforms.Partnershipswithmobiletechnologyde-
velopers and health care systems may ensure that knowledge
translation occurs without long delays, which are common in
biomedical research.
Conclusions
Kidney failure risk equations developed in a Canadian
population showed high discrimination and adequate cali-
bration when validated in 31 multinational cohorts. How-
ever, in some regions the addition of a calibration factor
may be necessary.
