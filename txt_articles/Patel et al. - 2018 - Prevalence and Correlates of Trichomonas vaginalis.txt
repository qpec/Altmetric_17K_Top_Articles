Background. The epidemiology of Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) infection in the United States is poorly defined.
Methods. Males and females aged 18–59 years who participated in the 2013–2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey and provided a urine specimen were tested for TV infection (n = 4057). Participants were also examined for Chlamydia 
trachomatis (CT) infection, genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, and herpes simplex virus type 2 serostatus. Weighted 
adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) were estimated by multivariable Poisson regression.
Results. TV infection prevalence was 0.5% and 1.8% among males and females, respectively. TV infection prevalence was 4.2% 
among black males, 8.9% among black females, and 0.03% and 0.8%, respectively, among males and females of other races/eth-
nicities. TV infection prevalence (aPR [95% confidence interval]) was positively associated with female sex (6.1 [3.3–11.3]), black 
race (vs other races/ethnicities; 7.9 [3.9–16.1]), older age (vs 18–24 years; 3.0 [1.2–7.1] for 25- to 39-year-olds and 3.5 [1.3–9.4] for 
40- to 59-year-olds), having less than a high school education (vs completing high school or more; 2.0 [1.0–4.1]), being below the 
poverty level (vs at or above the poverty level; 4.0 [2.1–7.7]), and having ≥2 sexual partners in the past year (vs 0–1 sexual partners; 
3.6 [2.0–6.6]). There were no TV and CT coinfections. Genital HPV detection was not independently associated with TV infection. 
Among persons aged 18-39 years, there was a significant racial disparity in all sexually transmitted infections examined, and this 
disparity was greatest for TV infection.
Conclusions. There is a high and disproportionate burden of urinary TV infection in the adult civilian, noninstitutionalized 
black population in the United States that warrants intervention.
Keywords. NHANES; Trichomonas vaginalis; trichomoniasis; sexually transmitted infection; racial disparities. 
Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) infection is the most common nonviral 
sexually transmitted infection (STI) worldwide [1]. Symptomatic 
TV infection is characterized by urethral discharge and dysuria in 
men, and vaginal discharge, dysuria, and abdominal pain in women 
[2, 3]. While most TV infections are asymptomatic in men and 
women [2, 4, 5], the pathologic sequelae from untreated and per-
sistent TV infection is more severe than previously acknowledged. 
In men, TV infection is a cause of urethritis and is associated with 
prostatitis, balanoposthitis, and epididymitis [6, 7]. In women, TV 
infection can lead to urethritis and is associated with infertility, peri-
natal morbidity, cervical neoplasia, and pelvic inflammatory disease 
[7–11]. Finally, TV infection is strongly linked to an increased risk 
of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition and trans-
mission [12]. Despite the frequency and severity of TV infection, 
TV infection has received a limited public health response to date 
and has consequently been coined a “neglected” STI [13].
In the United States, TV infection is not notifiable and routine 
surveillance programs do not exist [7], thereby requiring sen-
tinel surveillance to estimate the national burden of infection. 
Only 2 national population-based studies of TV infection have 
been conducted in the United States [4, 14]. In the 2001–2004 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 
it was first reported using swab-based polymerase chain reac-
tion (PCR) testing that the prevalence of TV infection among 
females aged 14–49 years was 3.1% [4]. The 2001–2002 National 
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health utilized urine-based 
PCR testing and reported that TV infection prevalence was 
1.7% and 2.8%, respectively, among males and females aged 
18–26 years [14]. The national prevalence among older adult 
males has not been previously determined; in general, the epi-
demiology of TV infection is less characterized among males 
in comparison to females, partly due to historical challenges 
in diagnostic testing. It is difficult to make direct comparisons 
between studies due to differential sampling and testing methods, 
but studies have reported even higher estimates of TV infection 
prevalence in young urban populations [5], internet-recruited

samples [15, 16], HIV/STI clinic populations [17, 18], incar-
cerated populations [19], people who use drugs [20, 21], and 
in other sentinel sites across the United States [22].
Although there are now US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA)–cleared nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) and 
point-of-care diagnostic tests for males and females [3, 23], and 
TV infection is curable with effective short-course regimens 
 
(1 or 7 days) [2, 7], most asymptomatic TV infections remain uni-
dentified and untreated. The US Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) supports TV testing in symptomatic women, 
but only provides a clear recommendation for TV screening (of 
symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals) in persons living with 
HIV [7]. The CDC does suggest, albeit with less assertion, that 
TV screening “might be considered” for individuals receiving care 
in settings with high prevalence (eg, prisons and sexually trans-
mitted disease [STD] clinics) and for individuals engaged in high-
risk behaviors (eg, multiple sex partners and illicit drug use) [7]. 
Additional population-based data are needed to help public health 
officials understand the burden of TV infection, identify at-risk 
populations, and appropriately direct disease control efforts.
In this study, we describe the prevalence and correlates of uri-
nary TV infection in a nationally representative sample of the 
adult civilian, noninstitutionalized US population.
METHODS
Ethics Statement
Data collection for the study was approved by the CDC 
Research Ethics Review Board. All participants provided writ-
ten informed consent. Data used in this analysis were de-identi-
fied and are publicly available. The present analysis was deemed 
exempt from review by the Johns Hopkins University School of 
Medicine Institutional Review Board.
Survey Design and Population
Administered by the National Center for Health Statistics 
(NCHS), the 2013–2014 NHANES is a complex survey of the 
US civilian, noninstitutionalized population. Respondents 
were interviewed in their homes and invited to a mobile exam-
ination center where a physical examination was performed. 
Respondents were eligible to undergo a blood draw, provide 
a urine sample and a self-administered penile/cervicovagi-
nal swab, and complete a self-administered audio computer-
assisted self-interview on sexual behavior. The examination 
response rate was 68.5% for all ages. This study was restricted to 
respondents aged 18–59 years who provided a urine sample and 
had valid TV results available for analysis.
Questionnaire Data
Sociodemographic and behavioral variables were collapsed into 
categories that maximized the stability of estimates while retaining 
epidemiological relevance. For instance, self-reported race/ethni-
city was operationalized as “black” or “other races/ethnicities” in 
this analysis. The “black” group was solely composed of persons 
identifying as non-Hispanic black (single race). The “other races/
ethnicities” group was composed of subgroups that were precate-
gorized by NCHS: Hispanics, non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic 
Asians, and other non-Hispanic races (including non-Hispanic 
multiracial persons). The lifetime number of sex partners and 
number of sex partners in the past year included any sex partner 
regardless of type of sexual experience or their partner’s gender.
Laboratory Testing
The NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual has detailed infor-
mation on specimen collection, processing, storage and test-
ing protocols [24]. Urinary TV infection status was determined 
using the Gen-Probe Aptima Combo Trichomonas vaginalis assay 
(Hologic, Gen-Probe, San Diego, California), which detects TV 
RNA by transcription-mediated amplification and has been FDA 
approved for use in urine from females. Age-eligible participants 
were also tested for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) (age 18–39 years), 
herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) (age 18–49 years), and gen-
ital human papillomavirus (HPV) (age 18–59 years). Urinary CT 
infection status was determined using the Gen-Probe Aptima 
Combo 2 C. trachomatis assay (Hologic, Gen-Probe). HSV-2 
serostatus was determined by the solid-phase enzymatic immu-
nodot assay and the gG-2 monoclonal antibody inhibition assay 
[25]. Genital swabs were used to assess HPV infection status 
(≥1 of 37 genotypes) by the Linear Array HPV Genotyping Test 
(Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Indiana).
Statistical Analysis
All reported prevalence estimates, measures of association, and 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) were weighted to account for the 
unequal probabilities of selection, non-response to the medi-
cal examination, and noncoverage using weights provided by 
NCHS. Standard errors were computed by the Taylor series lin-
earized (robust) variance estimator. Prevalence estimates with a 
relative standard error ≥30% are indicated and should be inter-
preted with caution.
In the primary analysis, TV infection prevalence was exam-
ined among all participants aged 18–59 years. Sociodemographic 
and behavioral correlates of TV infection were measured by 
prevalence ratios estimated by Poisson regression. All char-
acteristics assessed in univariable models were considered for 
inclusion in the multivariable analysis, but only covariates that 
remained statistically significant in nested multivariable models 
were retained in the final multivariable model (P < .05). In sep-
arate models, associations between other STIs and TV infection 
were examined; two multivariable models were constructed for 
each STI, one including only sociodemographic characteristics 
and one including both sociodemographic characteristics and 
the number of sexual partners in the past year. A subgroup ana-
lysis was conducted among females.
In a supplemental analysis, prevalence of each STI was com-
pared by race/ethnicity among participants aged 18–39 years,

using methods previously described. To enhance direct com-
parability of effect sizes between infections, a sensitivity analysis 
was conducted limited to participants with complete data for 
all infections. It should be noted that binomial models yielded 
similar estimates (data not shown).
Two-sided P values were determined by design-adjusted 
Wald F tests. All analyses were conducted using Stata/SE soft-
ware, version 14.2 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas).
RESULTS
Of the 4139 participants examined, 4057 participants had a 
urine specimen available for TV testing. Every urine specimen 
had valid TV results; 71 of 4057 participants in the analytic 
sample had detectable TV infection. The estimated prevalence 
of urinary TV infection in the civilian, noninstitutionalized US 
population aged 18–59 years was 1.2% (95% CI, .7%–2.0%).
TV Infection Prevalence by Sociodemographic and Behavioral 
Characteristics
In comparison to the age group 18–24 years (0.7%), TV infec-
tion prevalence was significantly higher among those aged 
25–39 years (1.4%; P = .045) and nonsignificantly higher among 
those aged 40–59 years (1.2%; P = .254; Table 1). The prevalence 
of TV infection was significantly higher among females (1.8%) 
than males (0.5%; P < .001; Table 1). TV infection prevalence 
was also significantly different by race/ethnicity group with an 
estimate of 6.8% among the black population and 0.4% among 
the other races/ethnicities group (P < .001). This racial disparity 
in TV infection was observed among both males and females 
(P < .001 for both comparisons; Figure 1).
TV infection prevalence was significantly higher among indi-
viduals below the poverty level (3.9%) than individuals at or 
above the poverty level (0.6%; P < .001; Table 1). Not obtaining 
a high school education was also significantly associated with

a higher prevalence of TV infection (2.9%) in comparison to 
having at least completed high school or an equivalent educa-
tion (0.8%; P < .001). Individuals born in the United States had 
a higher prevalence of TV infection (1.3%) than those born out-
side the United States (0.4%; P = .052). Prevalence of TV infec-
tion was similar between those who were never married (2.4%) 
and those who were widowed, divorced, or separated (2.0%; 
P = .692); however, both groups had a significantly higher prev-
alence of TV infection than individuals who were married or 
living with their partner (0.6%; P < .001 for both comparisons). 
Although a significant association was not detected between the 
number of lifetime sexual partners and TV infection prevalence 
(P = .176), having multiple sex partners in the past year was pos-
itively associated with TV infection (P < .001; Table 1).
In the multivariable model, female sex, black race, older age, 
being below the poverty level, not obtaining a high school educa-
tion, and having multiple sex partners in the past year were inde-
pendent factors associated with a higher TV infection prevalence 
(P < .05; Table 1). Correlates of TV infection prevalence observed 
in the overall sample were also observed among females (except 
educational attainment, P = .103; Supplementary Table 1).
STIs Associated With Urinary TV Infection Prevalence
Among participants aged 18–39 years, no one tested positive for 
infection with both CT and TV (Table 2). Among participants 
aged 18–49 years, there was a positive independent association 
between HSV-2 serostatus and TV infection (P < .01). Although 
HPV infection was associated with TV infection among partic-
ipants aged 18–59 years in univariable analysis (P = .014), this 
association was completely attenuated in multivariable models 
(Table 2). These results were also seen among females when 
analyzed separately (Supplementary Table 2).
Comparative Prevalence of STIs
Prevalence of TV infection, CT infection, HSV-2 serostatus, and 
HPV infection among young adults aged 18–39 years is shown 
in Table 3 by sex and race/ethnicity group. Although the rela-
tive racial disparity (effect size) of each STI was partially atten-
uated after adjustment for sociodemographic factors and the 
number of recent sexual partners, the racial disparity appeared 
to be greatest for TV infection (Table 3). Similar trends were 
observed when limiting the analysis to participants with com-
plete data for every infection (Supplementary Table 3).

 T. vaginalis Infection in the United States • CID 2018:67 (15 July) • 215
DISCUSSION
In this nationally representative sample of the civilian, nonin-
stitutionalized population aged 18–59 years, TV infection prev-
alence was estimated to be 0.5% among males and 1.8% among 
females. TV infection prevalence was highest among black 
males (4.2%) and black females (8.9%). The sex- and race-strat-
ified estimates of TV infection prevalence in this study exceed 
estimates of TV burden in other high-income countries [26]. 
There is a clear need to eliminate the health disparities pre-
sented herein and improve the overall sexual health of the US 
population.
This is the first national study in the United States to examine 
TV infection in males and females up to 59 years of age. In mul-
tivariable analysis, TV infection was positively associated with 
age. This may be due to the detection of untreated, persistent 
TV infections in older age groups; however, due to the cross-
sectional nature of this study, it is impossible to distinguish 
between incident and persistent TV infections. Long-term, 
prospective cohort studies are needed to better understand the 
natural history of TV infection across the life-span. The lower 
prevalence of TV infection in males compared to females in 
this study may in part be explained by sex differences in the 
susceptibility and host immune response to TV infection [6]. 
For instance, some studies have reported a relatively high 
rate of spontaneous resolution in males, which remains to be 
observed in females [6, 27]. The disparity in TV infection by 
sex in this study, however, may also be due to measurement 
error. Chernesky et al recently demonstrated that self-collected 
penile-meatal swabs are significantly more sensitive in detect-
ing TV infection than first-catch urine [28], suggesting that 
TV infection prevalence was underestimated among males in 
this study.
The previous NHANES study noted a higher TV infection 
prevalence in black females compared to females of other races/
ethnicities [4]. We highlight that this pronounced racial dis-
parity in TV infection is present among males and females. 
A higher burden of TV infection in the black population may 
be due to a combination of factors: differences in sexual net-
work characteristics (eg, assortative mixing—favoring sexual 
partners of the same race), differences in individual-level sex-
ual risk behaviors (eg, higher numbers of sexual partners), bio-
logical differences in susceptibility to infection, and social and 
structural disparities (eg, inadequate healthcare) [29]. From a 
social justice lens, it cannot be overlooked that structural rac-
ism could be a contributing factor to the racial disparity in TV 
infection [30]. A previous study has shown that neighborhood 
social disorganization is significantly associated with TV infec-
tion [31]. In this study, the racial disparity in TV infection per-
sisted despite adjustment for the number of sexual partners in 
the past year and appeared to exceed the relative racial disparity

This analysis reflects all available data for each individual infection among persons aged 18–39 years since all participants in this age group were eligible to be tested for each infection shown. 
The overall unweighted sample size was 2174 for urinary TV and CT infections, 2077 for HSV-2 serostatus, and 2017 for genital HPV infection (see Supplementary 
Table 3 for results limited to 
persons with complete data for all infections). Prevalence ratios of each infection were estimated from Poisson regression models to compare prevalence estimates by race/ethnicity group. 
The “Other races/ethnicities” group composed of Hispanics, non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic Asians, and persons of other non-Hispanic race (including multiracial persons) was the refer-
ence group. Adjusted PRs were estimated from multivariable Poisson regression models. P values were determined by the design-adjusted Wald F test. Estimates in bold had a P value <.05.

observed for other STIs, which supports the hypothesis that 
high individual-level sexual risk behavior likely does not fully 
explain the racial disparity in TV infection.
The unadjusted association between HPV infection and 
TV infection is consistent with a cohort study where HPV 
infections associated with concurrent TV infection exhib-
ited slower rates of HPV clearance than among those without 
TV infection [32]. Interestingly, this association was com-
pletely attenuated in multivariable analysis. Disentangling 
the relationship between HPV infection and TV infection is 
important given their individual associations with the devel-
opment of cervical neoplasia [8]. It is noteworthy that there 
were no CT/TV coinfections; while this could be due to lim-
ited power, this lack of association has also been observed else-
where and may be due to differences in sexual exposure risk 
[17]. On the other hand, the strong association between HSV-2 
serostatus and TV infection could be because HSV-2 serosta-
tus is a biomarker of previous high-risk sexual behavior [25]. 
The epidemiology and consequences of TV coinfection require 
further study.
This study has limitations. NHANES is a cross-sectional 
design, so reported associations should not be interpreted in a 
causal manner. The relatively low prevalence of TV infection 
led to imprecise estimates and precluded further stratification, 
particularly among males. As demographic characteristics such 
as race/ethnicity were self-reported and operationalized using 
broad analytic categories, this may have resulted in misclassi-
fication of some individuals. In addition, several variables of 
interest with inadequate power (eg, HIV, pregnancy, sexual 
orientation), and those that were not available (eg, incarcera-
tion history, genital symptoms, and other coinfections), could 
not be included in this analysis. Continued surveillance of TV 
infection in additional cycles of NHANES will allow for a more 
representative sample and in-depth analysis. Even so, NHANES 
is prone to systematic errors, such as nonresponse and use of 
a sampling frame that does not capture high-risk populations 
(eg, homeless and incarcerated populations). Coupled with 
potential errors in biological sampling in males, as previously 
discussed, this study likely underestimated the true prevalence 
of TV infection. Finally, it is important to recognize that these 
data cannot speak to potential geographic heterogeneity in TV 
infection prevalence.
There has been much debate about whether TV infection 
should become a nationally notifiable condition. It is well estab-
lished that TV infection meets 3 of the 7 CDC criteria needed to 
indicate an infection should be reportable: frequency, disparity, 
and communicability [33]. Although it was previously argued that 
TV infection does not meet the public interest criterion, a lack of 
public interest in TV infection cannot be assessed if there is inade-
quate public knowledge of TV [13]. For instance, a national survey 
of US women found that only 22% were very/somewhat familiar 
with TV infection [34]. Hoots et al suggested that it is unclear if 
TV infection meets the final 3 criteria: severity, costs associated 
with infection, and preventability [33]. Although severe outcomes 
directly attributable to TV infection are rare and/or difficult to 
determine, one model estimated that 746 new HIV cases occur-
ring annually among US women are attributable to TV infection 
(lifetime medical costs: $167 million) [35]. It should be clarified 
that TV infection—like most STIs—is preventable. Correct and 
consistent condom use and voluntary medical male circumcision 
have been shown to prevent TV infection [36–38]. In addition, a 
community-randomized trial in Peru demonstrated that a com-
bination prevention strategy can yield a significant reduction in 
TV infection prevalence [39]. It appears the question all the more 
so lies in the scalability of preventive interventions, which will 
require increased political will and financial support, and advo-
cacy for it by the public health community.
Regardless of whether TV infection is eventually deemed to 
be notifiable, a stronger public health response to TV infection 
in the immediate future is warranted [13]. We are unaware of any 
national efforts to specifically control TV infection. To increase 
awareness and public knowledge of TV infection, public health 
campaigns already in place for HIV/STI prevention could easily 
begin to include educational information about TV infection. 
A tangible step clinicians could take to potentially reduce the 
racial disparity in TV infection is to routinely screen and subse-
quently treat men and women in high-prevalence communities 
irrespective of HIV status. If barriers to routine screening exist, 
clinicians should strongly consider screening high-risk persons 
in accordance with CDC guidelines [7]. NAAT-based diagnos-
tic tests have already facilitated the implementation of routine 
screening programs for men and women in some STD and HIV 
clinics [17, 18, 40]. While such programs are commendable, 
the high burden of TV infection documented in this popula-
tion-based study highlights the need to extend screening efforts 
beyond STD clinics. Acceptability of TV infection screening has 
already been demonstrated in nonclinic populations [15, 16]. 
Finally, per CDC guidelines, clinicians need to be made aware 
of the need for concurrent presumptive treatment of all sex 
partners to prevent reinfection and the need to retest the index 
patient for TV infection posttreatment [7]. While there may 
indeed be insufficient empirical evidence that these strategies 
will lead to epidemic control or a reduction in the racial dispar-
ity of TV infection in the United States, it would be an injustice 
to the black population to continue to ignore this STI until such 
evidence is available.
Despite accurate diagnostic tools and effective treatment 
options, TV infection remains a prevalent infection in the adult 
civilian, noninstitutionalized US population. Increased public 
health action is needed to eliminate the stark racial dispari-
ties in TV infection and achieve racial equity in sexual health. 
Continued surveillance of TV infection at the national and local 
level is warranted to guide the development and implementa-
tion of effective public health interventions.
