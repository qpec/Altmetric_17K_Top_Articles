Abstract
Bisphenol A (BPA) is a ubiquitous environmental toxicant with endocrine-disrupting properties 
and suspected to affect human reproduction. Yet in humans, the studies exploring the effect of this 
BPA on male reproductive health including semen quality, reproductive hormones, and couple 
fecundity and fertility, have produced inconsistent results. The objective of this manuscript was to 
summarize the effects of male exposure to BPA on markers of testicular function and couple 
reproductive outcomes. Of the five studies on male BPA exposure and reproductive hormones, all 
found significant associations with at least one reproductive hormone; however no consistent 
relations were observed across studies. Similarly, five studies evaluated the relation between BPA 
and semen quality and while the majority reported negative associations with various parameters, 
there were few consistent trends across studies. Finally, the three studies which have examined 
male urinary BPA levels and couple reproductive outcomes did not find associations, with the 
exception being a link with lower secondary sex ratio (or greater female excess). Overall, while the 
literature on this topic is growing, the evidence supporting a link between male BPA exposure and 
male reproductive health remains limited and inconclusive. Reasons for the discrepancies in 
results could include, but are not limited to, differences in: study populations (e.g. fertile vs. 
subfertile men), BPA exposure levels (occupationally exposed vs. non-occupationally exposed), 
study procedures used to collect and measure urinary BPA (e.g. using one urine sample to 
characterize exposure vs. multiple samples), sample sizes, and study design (e.g. cross-sectional 
vs. prospective). Based on the available evidence, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that 
exposure to BPA, at low to moderate levels, has a negative effect on reproductive outcomes in 
men. Clearly, further studies are needed to further clarify the role of this ubiquitous endocrine 
disrupting chemical on male reproductive health.

 Introduction
Bisphenol A (BPA) is a high production volume chemical that is widely used in the 
manufacture of consumer products such as polycarbonate plastics, epoxy resin liners of 
canned foods, some dental sealants and composites, and thermal receipts (1). Due to its 
widespread use in consumer products, exposure to BPA is ubiquitous. In the US, more than 
90% of urine samples obtained from participants in the 2003–2004 and 2011–2012 National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) had BPA concentrations above the 
limit of detection (2–4). Exposure to BPA has garnered concern and regulatory attention 
over the past decade due to its potential endocrine disrupting effects. Specifically, in vitro 
studies have shown that aglycone (unconjugated) BPA binds to estrogen receptors α and β 
producing weak estrogenic activity (5, 6). Aglycone BPA also has high affinity for two 
membrane-bound estrogen receptors, G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 30 (7) and 
membrane estrogen receptor alpha (mERα) (8), in addition to an orphan nuclear estrogen-
related receptor gamma (9, 10). BPA has also been cited for its ability to bind to the 
androgen receptor, peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ, and thyroid hormone 
receptor in experimental animal studies (11).
In male rodents, the majority of studies on exposure to BPA and reproductive outcomes have 
confirmed these endocrine-disrupting activities. For example, exposure to low-dose BPA 
(lowest observed adverse effect level <50 mg/kg) was associated with decreased sperm 
counts in mice (12, 13) and adult rats (14–16), impaired sperm motility in rats (14, 15, 17) 
and mice (12), and increased sperm DNA damage in rats (14, 17–23) and mice (12, 24–26). 
In addition, exposure to low-dose BPA was related to decreased testosterone levels in rats 
(15, 23, 27, 28) and mice (29). However, a few experimental studies did not conclude that 
BPA is a testicular toxicant (30–33). These inconsistent results may be due to different 
methodological aspects such as dose, exposure route, timing, and outcomes. Therefore, 
further experiments in animals are needed to clarify the role of this endocrine disrupting 
chemical on male reproductive health.
In humans, there is a growing body of literature exploring the associations between male 
urinary BPA concentrations and semen quality parameters, DNA damage, and reproductive 
hormones and a few studies on paternal BPA exposure and markers of couple fecundity and 
fertility such as time to pregnancy and live birth (Table 1). Therefore, the objective of this 
manuscript was to review the epidemiologic literature on the effects of male exposure to 
BPA on semen quality, reproductive hormones and fecundity.
BPA and Semen Quality
Only five studies explored the relationship between urinary BPA concentrations and semen 
parameters and of these studies, two also examined the association with sperm DNA damage 
(Table 1). In the only prospective study to date, Li and colleagues explored the association of 
urinary BPA concentrations on semen parameters among 218 factory workers from four 
regions in China (34). This study found a negative association between urinary BPA 
concentrations and sperm concentration, total sperm count, sperm vitality, and sperm 
motility. Results for sperm concentration, vitality, and motility remained significant when

 the study population was restricted to men who were exposed to BPA occupationally 
(n=130) and had much higher urinary creatinine adjusted BPA concentrations [median (IQR) 
= 38.7 (6.3, 354.3) μg/gCr] compared with factory workers who did not have BPA 
occupational exposure [median (IQR) = 1.4 (0, 17.9) μg/gCr]. However, when models were 
restricted to non-occupationally exposed factory workers (n=88), who had lower urinary 
creatinine adjusted BPA concentrations, the only significant association was with diminished 
sperm concentrations. This study also found that on average, men who had detectable 
urinary BPA levels had more than three times the risk of having a reduced sperm 
concentration (<15 × 106 per mL) and vitality (<58%), more than four times the risk of 
having a low sperm count (<39 × 106 per ejaculate), and more than twice the risk of having 
low sperm motility (<40%), compared with men who did not have detectable urinary BPA 
concentrations. Urinary BPA levels were not associated with proportion of morphologically 
normal sperm in this population of Chinese workers (34).
In a cross-sectional study of 308 young men recruited during a compulsory physical 
examination for military service in Denmark (2008–2009), urinary BPA concentrations were 
inversely associated with progressive sperm motility (35). However, there were no 
associations of BPA with other sperm parameters. Of note, this population had low 
background urinary BPA concentrations [median (5th–95th percentiles) unadjusted urinary 
BPA concentration was 3.3 ng/mL (0.6, 14.9 ng/mL)] (35). The associations of BPA with 
semen parameters and DNA damage has also been assessed in several studies of men who, 
along with their partners, were trying to conceive (36–38). Meeker and coworkers explored 
the association of urinary BPA concentrations with semen parameters and DNA damage in 
190 male partners of subfertile couples seeking treatment at Massachusetts General Hospital 
(MGH) in Boston, Massachusetts (2000–2004) (37). They reported that urinary BPA 
concentrations were negatively associated with sperm concentration, normal morphology, 
and sperm DNA damage (as measured by the percentage of DNA in comet tail). They also 
found a suggestive association between higher urinary BPA concentrations and lower 
percentage progressively motile sperm. While 89% of samples in this population of 
subfertile men had detectable BPA concentrations, overall these men had relatively low 
urinary BPA concentrations [unadjusted geomean (GM) (IQR) was 1.6 (0.8, 2.3) ng/mL]. In 
the two other studies which included men from couples trying to conceive naturally, BPA 
was not associated with semen parameters despite having similar urinary BPA 
concentrations to the previous study of subfertile men (36, 38). For instance, Mendiola and 
colleagues investigated the relation of urinary BPA concentrations and sperm parameters in 
315 fertile men from the Study for Future Families (SFF), a multicenter study of couples 
recruited at prenatal clinics in four U.S. cities (Los Angeles, CA; Minneapolis, MN; 
Columbia, MO; and Iowa City, IA) who conceived without medical assistance between 1999 
and 2005 (38). Urinary BPA concentrations (GM (IQR) was 1.5 (0.8, 3.0) ng/mL) were not 
associated with any of the examined semen parameters in this study. Similarly, Goldstone 
and coworkers assessed the association of urinary BPA concentrations with sperm 
parameters in 418 men included in the Longitudinal Investigation of Fertility and the 
Environment (LIFE) Study (2005–2009), a cohort study which followed couples attempting 
pregnancy in Michigan and Texas (36). Urinary BPA concentrations [unadjusted GM (5th, 
95th) was 0.6 ng/mL (95% CI 0.5, 0.6 ng/mL)] were not associated with semen parameters

 among these men. Unexpectedly, higher urinary BPA concentrations were associated with 
decreased sperm DNA fragmentation.
BPA and Reproductive Hormones
The epidemiologic literature investigating the endocrine-disrupting effects of BPA on male 
reproductive hormones is also limited and presents heterogeneous results (Table 1). To date, 
one study explored this association among men occupationally exposed to BPA (39), two 
others studied the association among men from the general population (35, 40), and the 
remaining two studies investigated this association among either fertile men or subfertile 
men from a fertility clinic (38, 41). Hanaoka et al. explored the association of urinary BPA 
concentrations with plasma gonadotrophic hormones and testosterone levels in male epoxy 
resin sprayers from Japan who were exposed to BPA diglycidyl ether and mixed organic 
solvents at work (39). Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were lower in the 42 
workers who were BPA exposed compared with 42 workers who were not occupationally 
exposed; however luteinizing hormone (LH) and free testosterone (fT) levels were not 
different between groups. Surprisingly, these Japanese workers had low levels of urinary 
BPA (median BPA concentration (range) was 1.1 (0, 11.2 μg/g Cr for BPA exposed workers 
and 0.5 (0, 11.0) μg/g Cr for BPA un-exposed workers) (39).
Galloway and coworkers investigated the association of urinary BPA concentrations with 
male reproductive hormones among 307 men from the InCHIANTI Study, a population-
based study to identify risk factors for mid- and late-life morbidity in randomly selected 
healthy adults in Tuscany, Italy (40). Increasing urinary BPA concentrations were associated 
with higher serum testosterone (T) concentrations among a population who had a GM (5th, 
95th percentiles) BPA concentration of 4.0 ng/mL (3.8, 4.3). However, the authors did not 
find an association between BPA and estradiol (E2), sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG), 
or fT (40). Urinary BPA concentrations were also positively associated with serum 
testosterone concentrations in 308 young Danish men from the general population who were 
military conscripts. Moreover, these men had comparable urinary BPA concentrations to the 
previous study [median (5th, 95th percentiles) of 3.3 ng/mL (0.6, 14.9) ng/mL] (35). In 
contrast to the Italian study, however, this study also found that urinary BPA concentrations 
were positively associated with fT, E2, and LH levels. There was no association between 
urinary BPA concentrations and FSH, inhibin B, or SHBG in this cohort of young healthy 
men.
Mendiola and colleagues evaluated the association of urinary BPA concentrations with 
reproductive hormones in a cohort of 315 fertile men recruited from prenatal clinics (38). 
While their urinary BPA concentrations were lower than the previous two cohorts (GM 
(IQR) was 1.5 (0.8, 3.0) ng/mL), they found that urinary BPA concentrations were positively 
associated with SHBG, and inversely associated with free androgen index (FAI) and 
FAI/LH. Levels of FSH, LH, T, inhibin B and fT were unrelated to BPA in this population. 
Finally, in a cross-sectional study of 167 subfertile men from couples seeking treatment at 
MGH in Boston, urinary BPA concentrations were negatively associated with inhibin B 
levels and E2:T ratio and positively associated FSH levels and FSH:inhibin B ratio (41). 
This group of men also had low urinary BPA concentrations [GM (IQR) was 1.3 ng/mL (0.7,

 2.4 ng/mL)] compared to the European cohorts; however their concentrations were similar to 
those in the study by Mendiola and colleagues.
BPA and Couple Reproductive Outcomes
The association of male urinary BPA concentrations with couple reproductive outcomes has 
recently been assessed in two studies (Table 1). Using the EARTH Study, which is a cohort 
of subfertile couples undergoing fertility treatment at MGH (Boston), Dodge and 
collaborators examined the associations of paternal urinary BPA concentrations with 
fertilization, embryo quality, implantation, and live birth among 218 couples who underwent 
195 intrauterine inseminations and 211 in vitro fertilization cycles (42). No associations 
between paternal urinary BPA concentrations and reproductive outcomes following fertility 
treatment were found. The association of paternal urinary BPA concentrations with couple 
reproductive outcomes was also investigated in a longitudinal cohort study (LIFE Study) of 
501 couples discontinuing contraception with the intention of becoming pregnant. Similar to 
the findings among the fertility clinic patients, Buck-Louis et al. did not find association 
between paternal urinary BPA concentrations and time to pregnancy (fecundity odds ratio 
(FOR) was 1.04; 95% CI, 0.91, 1.18) (43). However, in an analysis focused on secondary 
sex ratio (ratio of male to female births) among couples in the LIFE Study who had a 
singleton live birth, higher paternal urinary BPA concentrations were significantly associated 
with fewer male births (RR= 0.77 per 1 SD increase in urinary BPA; 95% CI, 0.62–0.95) 
(44). In both the EARTH and LIFE Studies, the men had, on average, low urinary BPA 
concentrations [unadjusted GM (IQR) was 1.6 ng/mL (0.8, 2.8 ng/mL), and (5th, 95th 
percentiles) was 0.5 ng/mL (0.4, 0.6 ng/mL), respectively].
Conclusions
In this paper, we review the available epidemiologic literature on the association of male 
BPA exposure with semen quality, reproductive hormones and couple reproductive 
outcomes. While the literature on this topic is growing, the evidence supporting a link 
between male BPA exposure and reproductive health remains limited and inconclusive. 
Several methodological differences could explain some of the discrepancies between studies. 
First, they included different study populations of men and some, for example, included 
fertile men who may be less susceptible to the effects of BPA than would subfertile men. 
Second, urinary BPA concentrations varied across studies. If there is a non-linear association 
between BPA exposure and markers of reproductive health then we may find consistent 
results across study populations with markedly different exposure levels. However, it is 
worth noting that contradictory results were found even among populations with comparable 
urinary concentrations. Third, many studies only used one urine sample to measure exposure 
to BPA, despite its short half-life, which could have resulted in substantial measurement 
error and attenuation of associations. Fourth, the majority of studies relating urinary BPA 
concentrations to reproductive hormones and semen quality parameters were cross-sectional, 
which makes causality difficult to determine. Moreover, if exposure to BPA is not constant, 
the time window of BPA exposure captured in these cross-sectional studies (e.g. the last 24 
hours) may not be the biologically relevant exposure window. Finally, while male urinary 
BPA concentrations were not related to the more clinically relevant outcomes of couple

 fecundity (e.g. time to pregnancy or implantation) or fertility (e.g. live birth), these studies 
had limited power to observe small to moderate effect estimates. In conclusion, there is 
currently insufficient evidence on male exposure to BPA, at low to moderate levels, and its 
association with reproductive outcomes.
