In Brief
The molecular mechanisms underlying
the action of lithium on the nervous
system remain enigmatic. Meisel and Kim
show that loss of the lithium-sensitive
phosphatase BPNT-1 or inhibition of
BPNT-1 by lithium can cause selective
toxicity to specific neurons, resulting in
corresponding effects on behavior in the
simple animal Caenorhabditis elegans.

SUMMARY
Lithium has been a mainstay for the treatment of
bipolar disorder, yet the molecular mechanisms un-
derlying its action remain enigmatic. Bisphosphate
30-nucleotidase (BPNT-1) is a lithium-sensitive phos-
phatase that catalyzes the breakdown of cytosolic
30-phosphoadenosine 50-phosphate (PAP), a byprod-
uct of sulfation reactions utilizing the universal sul-
fate group donor 30-phosphoadenosine 50-phospho-
sulfate (PAPS) [1–3]. Loss of BPNT-1 leads to the
toxic accumulation of PAP in yeast and non-neuronal
cell types in mice [4, 5]. Intriguingly, BPNT-1 is ex-
pressed throughout the mammalian brain [4], and it
has been hypothesized that inhibition of BPNT-1
could contribute to the effects of lithium on behavior
[5]. Here, we show that loss of BPNT-1 in Caenorhab-
ditis elegans results in the selective dysfunction of
two neurons, the bilaterally symmetric pair of ASJ
chemosensory neurons. As a result, BPNT-1 mutants
are defective in behaviors dependent on the ASJ
neurons, such as dauer exit and pathogen avoid-
ance. Acute treatment with lithium also causes
dysfunction of the ASJ neurons, and we show that
this effect is reversible and mediated specifically
through inhibition of BPNT-1. Finally, we show that
the selective effect of lithium on the nervous system
is due in part to the limited expression of the cyto-
solic sulfotransferase SSU-1 in the ASJ neuron pair.
Our data suggest that lithium, through inhibition of
BPNT-1 in the nervous system, can cause selective
toxicity to specific neurons, resulting in correspond-
ing effects on behavior of C. elegans.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We have previously shown that the daf-7 gene, encoding a
TGF-b ligand that regulates diverse behaviors in C. elegans
[6, 7], is transcriptionally activated in the ASJ chemosensory
neuron pair upon exposure to the pathogenic bacteria Pseudo-
monas aeruginosa [8]. We conducted a forward genetic screen
for animals defective in this transcriptional response and identi-
fied one such mutant, qd257, which carries a D119N missense
mutation in bpnt-1 (Figures 1A–1C). This aspartic acid residue
is conserved from yeast to humans and is required for the cata-
lytic activity of the superfamily of lithium-sensitive phosphatases
[9, 10]. Confirming the identity of qd257 as an allele of bpnt-1, we
used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing to generate a
loss-of-function bpnt-1 allele, qd303, in which a frameshift at
amino acid 20 leads to a premature stop codon. Animals car-
rying bpnt-1(qd303) or the W294X nonsense mutation bpnt-
1(gk469190) also fail to express daf-7 in the ASJ neurons when
exposed to P. aeruginosa (Figures 1B and 1C). Notably, the
constitutive expression of daf-7 in the ASI neuron pair is unaf-
fected by loss of bpnt-1 (Figure 1B). These data suggest that
BPNT-1 is required for the expression of daf-7 specifically in
the ASJ neurons.
BPNT-1 is conserved in all eukaryotes and belongs to a family
of lithium-sensitive phosphatases that includes inositol mono-
phosphatase and inositol polyphosphate-1-phosphatase (Fig-
ure S1). Loss of BPNT-1 in mice leads to the toxic accumulation
of 30-phosphoadenosine 50-phosphate (PAP) and death by liver
failure at 45 days [4], and so we were surprised that bpnt-1 mu-
tants were viable and appeared healthy. We used fluorescence
in situ hybridization to analyze the bpnt-1 expression pattern
and observed broad mRNA expression throughout the animal
(Figure S2), confirming previous high-throughput expression
analysis [11]. bpnt-1 mRNA was almost entirely absent in the
bpnt-1(qd303) mutant, demonstrating that the bpnt-1 expres-
sion pattern was specific (Figure S2). Transgenic expression of
genomic bpnt-1 DNA, or bpnt-1 cDNA under a promoter that
drives expression exclusively in the ASJ neurons, rescued the
daf-7 expression defect in the ASJ neurons (Figures 1B and
1C). Consistent with this observation and our previous results
that established a role for daf-7 induction in promoting pathogen
avoidance [8], bpnt-1 mutant animals are defective in the protec-
tive behavioral avoidance of P. aeruginosa (Figure 1D). We there-
fore conclude that despite its widespread expression, BPNT-1 is
not essential in C. elegans and is acting cell autonomously to
promote the function of the ASJ neurons.
We determined that the gross morphology of the ASJ neu-
rons was still intact in the bpnt-1 mutant background through
labeling with a lipophilic dye. However, we also observed a
reduction in the cytoplasmic volume of the ASJ neurons (Fig-
ure 1E). This led us to ask whether the expression of other
genes in the ASJ neurons and additional ASJ-dependent be-
haviors might be affected in the bpnt-1 mutant. Indeed, expres-
sion of the insulin-like peptide daf-28 [12], the G protein alpha
subunit gpa-9 [13], and the thioredoxin trx-1 [14] were all
decreased in the bpnt-1 mutant (Figures 2A–2C). Expression
of gpa-9 in tail neurons and expression of daf-28 in the
ASI neurons were unaffected by loss of bpnt-1 (data not
shown), further suggestive of ASJ-specific effects of the loss

 of BPNT-1 function. In addition, exit from the dauer reproduc-
tive diapause state, a behavior which requires the ASJ neurons
[15, 16], was severely impaired in animals lacking BPNT-1 (Fig-
ure 1F). The dauer exit defect was partially rescued by express-
ing bpnt-1 from an ASJ-specific promoter, demonstrating that
BPNT-1 activity in the ASJ neurons is required for the dauer
exit behavior (Figure 1G). From these observations we conclude
that ASJ transcription and ASJ-dependent behaviors are defec-
tive in BPNT-1 mutants.
Given that BPNT-1 enzymatic activity is potently inhibited by
lithium in vitro [1–3], we asked whether the effects of lithium on
C. elegans would mimic the loss of BPNT-1. Indeed, acute expo-
sure to 15 mM LiCl significantly decreased the expression of all
ASJ-specific genes, including daf-28, gpa-9, and trx-1 (Figures
2A–2C). Similar to the effects of loss of BPNT-1, expression of
these genes in other neurons was not affected by lithium treat-
ment (data not shown). The inhibitory effects of lithium treatment
were reversible—following 24 hr recovery, daf-28::gfp expres-
sion in the ASJ neurons had increased to levels slightly above un-
treated animals (Figure 2D). Acute lithium exposure also reduced
the cytoplasmic volume of the ASJ neurons (Figure 2E). Addition-
ally, dauer exit behavior was inhibited by lithium treatment to
levels similar to bpnt-1 mutant animals (Figure 2F). These results
indicate that the ASJ neurons are selectively and reversibly in-
hibited by lithium.
Lithium can inhibit the activity of phosphatases other than
BPNT-1, such as inositol phosphatases, and we wondered
whether the effects of lithium were mediated by inhibition of
BPNT-1. A mutation in the BPNT-1 yeast homolog MET22/
HAL2 (V70A) has been characterized that does not affect its cat-
alytic activity but confers 10-fold resistance to inhibition by
lithium [10]. This hydrophobic residue is conserved not only in
all BPNT-1 homologs but in the homologous inositol phospha-
tases as well. In fact, introduction of the corresponding mutation
into human inositol monophosphatase (I68A) or a bacterial
inositol monophosphatase (L81A) renders these proteins lithium
insensitive [10, 17], suggesting that the homologous change
would be effective on the much more closely related C. elegans
BPNT-1. Introduction of this BPNT-1 variant (I75A in C. elegans)
into the bpnt-1(qd303) mutant fully rescued the ASJ expression
defect of daf-28 and in addition rendered the ASJ neuron resis-
tant to the transcriptional and morphological effects of lithium
treatment (Figures 2E and 2G). Animals expressing BPNT-
1(I75A) were also resistant to the effects of lithium treatment
on dauer exit, strongly suggestive that the effects of lithium on
C. elegans dauer exit behavior are due to the inhibition of
BPNT-1 (Figure 2F). Additionally, mutations in lithium-sensitive
inositol monophosphatase TTX-7 or Golgi-resident PAP phos-
phatase GPAP-1 did not mimic the addition of lithium (Fig-
ure S3A). These data suggest that the inhibitory effects of lithium
on the ASJ neurons are mediated through inhibition of the
lithium-sensitive phosphatase BPNT-1.
To identify the molecular mechanism by which loss of BPNT-1
leads to dysfunction of the ASJ neuron, we undertook cross-
species rescue experiments with homologs of restricted sub-
strate specificity. In addition to catalyzing the breakdown of
PAP into 50-AMP, BPNT-1 has been shown to have in vitro
inositol polyphosphate-1-phosphatase (IPP) activity [2, 3].
Intriguingly, although IPP was present in the common ancestor
of all animals, as evidenced by its presence in cnidarians and
sponges, IPP was lost in the nematode lineage (Figure S1). We
therefore sought to determine whether BPNT-1 might be func-
tioning as an IPP in C. elegans neurons. Expression of bpnt-1
cDNA from C. elegans or D. melanogaster driven by the endog-
enous C. elegans bpnt-1 promoter rescued the daf-7 expression
defect in the ASJ neurons (Figures 3A and 3B). However, intro-
duction of D. melanogaster or H. sapiens IPP cDNA was unable
to rescue the daf-7 expression defect in bpnt-1 mutants, sug-
gesting that the ASJ defect of bpnt-1 mutant animals is not
due to a loss of IPP activity (Figures 3A and 3B). Instead, intro-
duction of the S. cerevisiae BPNT-1 homolog MET22/HAL2,
which has been shown to have PAP phosphatase activity but
weak IPP activity [1, 2], fully rescued the bpnt-1(qd303) daf-7
expression phenotype (Figures 3A and 3B). These data support
our hypothesis that loss of BPNT-1 causes ASJ neuronal
dysfunction through the accumulation of PAP.
How could loss of BPNT-1, which is widely expressed in
C. elegans, selectively increase PAP levels and inhibit the two
ASJ neurons? PAP is generated in the cytosol as a byproduct
of sulfation reactions in which cytosolic sulfotransferases trans-
fer a sulfate group from 30-phosphoadenosine 50-phosphosul-
fate (PAPS) onto endogenous and xenobiotic targets such as
hormones and catecholamines [18]. This is in contrast to
Golgi-derived PAP, which is generated by sulfotransferases
that act on proteins and carbohydrates and is degraded by a
Golgi-resident PAP 30-phosphatase that is homologous to
BPNT-1 [19]. Surprisingly, C. elegans has only one cytosolic sul-
fotransferase in its genome, SSU-1, and SSU-1 is exclusively ex-
pressed in the ASJ neurons [20, 21]. We therefore asked whether
loss of SSU-1 could suppress the ASJ defect in BPNT-1 mu-
tants. Indeed, loss of SSU-1 could partially suppress the daf-
28 and daf-7 expression defects of BPNT-1 mutants, even
though ssu-1 mutants themselves were slightly defective in
these assays (Figures 3C and S3B). Loss of SSU-1 could also
partially suppress the reduction of cytoplasmic volume of the
ASJ cell body that we observe in BPNT-1 mutant animals (Fig-
ure 3D). These data suggest that the specific expression of the
cytosolic sulfotransferase SSU-1 in the ASJ neuron pair may
contribute to the selective neuronal dysfunction caused by loss
of BPNT-1.
The incomplete suppression of bpnt-1 phenotypes by muta-
tion in ssu-1 could be due to residual cytosolic PAP produced
by additional unidentified cytosolic sulfotransferases. Alterna-
tively, Golgi-derived PAP may enter the cytosol via PAPS/PAP

 and found the double mutants to be inviable, displaying early
larval lethality. This observation suggests that BPNT-1 and
GPAP-1 act redundantly throughout the organism to degrade
Golgi-produced PAP, which may explain the broad expression
pattern of bpnt-1. However, in the ASJ neuron pair, where there
exists a unique source of cytosolic PAP due to expression of
ssu-1 and perhaps an increased source of Golgi-derived PAP
due to the secretory nature of the ASJ neurons, BPNT-1 is
required for cellular function.
Inositol monophosphatase and inositol polyphosphate-1-
phosphatase belong to a family of evolutionarily conserved
phosphatases that are inhibited by lithium at therapeutic con-
centrations [24, 25], which has led to the ‘‘inositol depletion’’ hy-
pothesis for explaining lithium’s effects on the mammalian brain
[26]. BPNT-1 has also been proposed to be a potential therapeu-
tic target of lithium [5]. Here we provide evidence that inhibition of
BPNT-1 can cause cell-selective dysfunction resulting in neuron-
specific effects on behavior in C. elegans. The ASJ neurons of
C. elegans are acutely sensitive to both the loss of BPNT-1
and the addition of lithium, perhaps due to their expression of
the cytosolic sulfotransferase SSU-1 that generates cytosolic
PAP (Figure 4). Accumulation of PAP can interfere with numerous
cellular processes including sulfotransferase activity, RNA
processing, nucleotide phosphorylation, and PARP activity
[23, 27–30]. Our data suggest that the differential expression of
cytosolic sulfotransferases may result in neuron-selective ef-
fects of lithium through inhibition of BPNT-1 and buildup of cyto-
solic PAP. Intriguingly, cytosolic sulfotransferases are expressed
selectively in the mammalian brain, particularly in neurons that
synthesize catecholamine neurotransmitters [31, 32], and we hy-
pothesize that these populations of neurons may display
enhanced susceptibility to inhibition of BPNT-1. We anticipate
that our data in C. elegans on the neuron-selective effects of
lithium, which acts through inhibition of the evolutionarily

through Inhibition of BPNT-1
We hypothesize that inhibition of the cytosolic PAP phosphatase BPNT-1 by
lithium or genetic mutation leads to a buildup of toxic PAP, due to ASJ-specific
expression of the cytosolic sulfotransferase SSU-1. PAP, in turn, causes al-
terations in cell morphology, transcription, and behavioral outputs of the ASJ
neurons. BPNT-1 can also degrade PAP transported into the cytosol from the
Golgi, which may explain the synthetic lethality between BPNT-1 and the
Golgi-resident PAP phosphatase GPAP-1.
