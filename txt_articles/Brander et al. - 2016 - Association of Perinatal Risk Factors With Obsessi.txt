IMPORTANCE Perinatal complications may increase the risk of obsessive-compulsive disorder
(OCD). Previous reports were based on small, retrospective, specialist clinic–based studies
that were unable to rigorously control for unmeasured environmental and genetic
confounding.
OBJECTIVE To prospectively investigate a wide range of potential perinatal risk factors for
OCD, controlling for unmeasured factors shared between siblings in the analyses.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This population-based birth cohort study included all
2 421 284 children from singleton births in Sweden from January 1, 1973, to December 31,
1996, who were followed up through December 31, 2013. From the 1 403 651 families in the
cohort, differentially exposed siblings from the 743 885 families with siblings were evaluated;
of these, 11 592 families included clusters of full siblings that were discordant for OCD.
Analysis of the data was conducted from January, 26, 2015, to September, 5, 2016.
EXPOSURES Perinatal data were collected from the Swedish Medical Birth Register and
included maternal smoking during pregnancy, labor presentation, obstetric delivery,
gestational age (for preterm birth), birth weight, birth weight in relation to gestational age,
5-minute Apgar score, and head circumference.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Previously validated OCD codes (International Statistical
Classification of Diseases and Health Related Problems, Tenth Revision, code F42) in the
Swedish National Patient Register.
RESULTS Of 2 421 284 individuals included in the cohort, 17 305 persons were diagnosed with
OCD. Of these, 7111 were men (41.1%). The mean (SD) age of individuals at first diagnosis of
OCD was 23.4 (6.5) years. An increased risk for OCD remained after controlling for shared
familial confounders and measured covariates (including sex, year of birth, maternal and
paternal age at birth, and parity), for smoking 10 or more cigarettes per day during pregnancy
(hazard ratio [HR], 1.27; 95% CI, 1.02-1.58), breech presentation (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.06-1.71),
delivery by cesarean section (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.01-1.34), preterm birth (HR, 1.24; 95% CI,
1.07-1.43), birth weight 1501 to 2500 g (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.05-1.62) and 2501 to 3500 g (HR,
1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.16), being large for gestational age (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.05-1.45), and Apgar
distress scores at 5 minutes (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.07-2.09). Gestational age and birth weight
followed inverse dose-response associations, whereby an increasingly higher risk for OCD
was noted in children with a shorter gestational age and lower birth weight. We also observed
a dose-response association between the number of perinatal events and increased OCD risk,
with HRs ranging from 1.11 (95% CI, 1.07-1.15) for 1 event to 1.51 (95% CI, 1.18-1.94) for 5 or
more events.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A range of perinatal risk factors is associated with a higher risk
for OCD independent of shared familial confounders, suggesting that perinatal risk factors
may be in the causal pathway to OCD.

W
ith much of the current focus on the discovery of ge-
netic factors conferring risk for development of ob-
sessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), environmen-
tal risk factors have received relatively little attention. Because
environmental factors are at least as important as genetic fac-
tors in the development of OCD,1,2 the identification of such
risk factors should be viewed as a research priority.
At the present time, to our knowledge, there are no ro-
bust environmental risk factors known to play a causal role in
the development of OCD. Previous OCD studies3 have had sev-
eral important methodologic weaknesses, including the pre-
dominant use of retrospective designs and recruitment of pa-
tientsfromspecialistclinics,limitingtheconfidenceinthedata
and generalizability of the findings. The success of gene by en-
vironment interaction studies depends on high-quality epi-
demiologic methods, including a detailed objective assess-
ment of environmental exposures.4
Complications in the perinatal period, including delivery
by cesarean section, delivery using vacuum extraction, pre-
term birth, and low birth weight, have been associated with a
range of psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia,5 bipo-
lar disorder,6,7 autism spectrum disorder,8,9 and attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).9,10 Few studies,3,11-17
most of which were retrospective, indicate that perinatal com-
plications may also play a role in OCD, but the methodologic
weaknesses of those studies preclude firm conclusions.
Most research into risk factors for mental disorders has pri-
marily relied on adjusting for statistical covariates to account
forconfoundingbuthasgenerallynottakenfamilialeffectsinto
account.18 Perinatal factors may exhibit a spurious associa-
tion with a disorder, not representing a causal link but in-
stead being explained by unmeasured confounders, such as
parental mental health, social adversity, or maternally trans-
mitted inherited factors.19 Family-based study designs pro-
vide a better control for such unmeasured environmental and
genetic factors; comparison of full siblings raised in the same
family but discordant for the exposure automatically ex-
cludes confounding of all shared environmental and a sub-
stantial proportion of genetic factors.20
In this longitudinal, population-based cohort study, we
aimed to explore the potential causal link between OCD and
a range of perinatal factors. Unlike previous studies,3 which
tended to explore a limited number of risk factors at a time,
we investigated a broad range of exposures and controlled
for measured covariates, specifically, year of birth, sex,
maternal and paternal age at birth, and parity. A sibling com-
parison design was used to further control for shared famil-
ial confounders.
Methods
Study Population
Thestudycohort,consistingofall2 421 284livesingletonbirths
in Sweden from January 1, 1973, through December 31, 1996,
was followed up until first diagnosis of OCD (available from
1997, when the International Statistical Classification of Dis-
eases and Health Related Problems, Tenth Revision was
introduced21), migration, death, or end of follow-up (Decem-
ber 31, 2013), whichever came first. The data were obtained by
linking individuals through their unique personal identifica-
tion numbers22 from the following population-based regis-
ters: (1) the Swedish Medical Birth Register,23 which includes
dataonmorethan99%ofallpregnanciesanddeliveriesinSwe-
den since 1973; (2) the Swedish Multi-generation Register,24
with information about kinship going back to 1932, contain-
ing information on 100% of mothers and 98% of fathers of in-
dex persons born after 1961; (3) the Swedish National Patient
Register,25 which covers all inpatient hospital admissions
since 1969 and outpatient care since 2001; (4) the Migration
Register,26 providing information about migration in and out
of Sweden; and (5) the Cause of Death Register,27 with infor-
mation on dates and causes of all deaths since 1961. Informa-
tion from the Cause of Death Register and the Migration Reg-
ister was used to calculate censoring time. For the sibling
comparison analysis, we identified a subsample of 743 885
familieswithatleast2fullsiblings(ie,siblingssharingthesame
biologicalmotherandfather)duringthesametimeperiodfrom
the Swedish Multi-generation Register.
Ethics approval and waiver of informed consent was ob-
tained from the Regional Ethical Review Board in Stockholm.
Therequirementforinformedconsentwaswaivedbecausethe
study was register based and data on the included individu-
als were deidentified.
Exposures
Information about all prenatal exposures was retrieved from
the Swedish Medical Birth Register. Unless otherwise speci-
fied, information was available from January 1, 1973, to De-
cember 31, 2013.
Maternal Smoking During Pregnancy
Information on maternal smoking during pregnancy col-
lected at the first antenatal visit is available in the Swedish
Medical Birth Register from 1982, marking the start of cohort
inclusion for this exposure (n = 1 547 271). The information is
categorized as no daily smoking, 1 to 9 cigarettes per day, and
10 or more cigarettes per day.
Key Points
Question Do adverse perinatal events increase the risk for
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)?
Findings In a population-based birth cohort study of 2.4 million
children in Sweden, maternal smoking during pregnancy, breech
presentation, delivery by cesarean section, preterm birth, low
birth weight, being large for gestational age, and Apgar distress
scores were associated with a higher risk of developing OCD,
independently of shared familial confounders. A dose-response
association was identified for a number of perinatal events, with
a higher risk for OCD noted in individuals with a greater number
of events.
Meaning The findings of this study are important for the
understanding of the cause of OCD and will inform future studies
on gene by environment interaction and epigenetics.

Labor Presentation and Obstetric Delivery
Labor presentation was divided into normal presentation,
breechpresentation,andothermalpresentations.Obstetricde-
livery was divided into 3 hierarchical categories: cesarean
section, assisted vaginal delivery (use of forceps or vacuum ex-
traction), and unassisted vaginal delivery.
Gestational Age and Birth Weight
Gestational age and birth weight were analyzed in 2 ways. In
the first method, data were evaluated as continuous variables
with linear and quadratic terms included. Gestational age
was distributed as every week and birth weight was distrib-
uted as every 250 g. In the second analysis, gestational age
was categorized as very preterm birth (gestational age <32
weeks), preterm birth (32-36 weeks), term birth (37-41
weeks), and postterm birth (≥42 weeks), and birth weight
was categorized as 1500 g or less (very low birth weight), 1501
to 2500 g (low birth weight), 2501 to 3500 g, 3501 to 4500 g
(normal birth weight [reference category]), and more than
4500 g (high birth weight). Small for gestational age and large
for gestational age were defined as a birth weight of more
than 2 SDs below and above the mean weight for gestational
age, respectively, according to the Scandinavian fetal growth
curve adjusted for sex.28
Apgar Score
The Apgar score29 of the index neonate at 5 minutes after
delivery was categorized as normal (a score of ≥7), distress
(4-6),orneardeath(≤3)inaccordancewithneonatalpractice.30
The Apgar score is a tool for evaluating heart rate, respiratory
effort, reflex irritability, muscle tone, and color after delivery,
considered to be 5 useful indicators that could be determined
easily without interfering with the care of the infant.
Head Circumference
Small head circumference was defined as head circumfer-
ence below the 10th percentile for each gestational week, and
large head circumference was that above the 90th percentile
for each gestational week. These categories were established
according to the World Health Organization standards.31
Outcome and Covariates
The first instance of a recorded OCD diagnosis in the National
Patient Register constituted the outcome. The OCD diagnosis
was defined as code F42 according to ICD-10, which was in-
troduced in Sweden in 1997. The OCD codes in the National Pa-
tientRegisterarereliableandvalid.32Dataonallpotentialmea-
sured confounders were collected from the Swedish Medical
Birth Register (year of birth, sex, parity, and maternal age at
childbirth) and the Swedish Multi-generation Register (pater-
nal age at childbirth).
Statistical Analysis
Differences in sociodemographic and clinical variables be-
tween OCD cases and non-OCD cases were determined with
χ2 or 2-tailed t tests for independent samples. We performed
Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to estimate haz-
ard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs of the association between peri-
natal factors and OCD. Three different Cox proportional haz-
ards regression models were fitted for all exposure variables:
(1) crude associations with OCD were modeled separately for
each exposure variable, (2) analysis was adjusted for sex and
yearofbirth,and(3)allmeasuredconfounders,aslistedabove,
were adjusted for in the fully adjusted model.
For continuous variables (ie, gestational age and birth
weight), we fitted both a linear and quadratic representation.
We used the Akaike information criterion to determine which
model (ie, linear or linear + quadratic) best fit the data.
The analyses were replicated in a fixed-effects model of
the subsample of clusters of all full siblings by using stratified
Cox proportional hazards regression models. By design, these
models adjust for shared familial confounders33 and, in par-
ticular, for genetic factors and unmeasured shared confound-
erssuchassocioeconomicstatusorstableparentalfactors.Fur-
thermore, we adjusted for all measured confounders, which
typically vary between siblings.
To confirm that the associations were not entirely ex-
plained by comorbid conditions, we performed sensitivity
analyses in subgroups in which all individuals with comorbid
conditionswereexcludedfromanalysis.Theseconditionswere
organized in 3 clusters: organic disorders (ie, organic brain dis-
order and epilepsy), psychotic disorders (ie, schizophrenia and
bipolar disorder), and neuropsychiatric disorders (ie, ADHD,
pervasive developmental disorders, and mental retardation).
All disorders were defined as at least 1 registered diagnosis in
the National Patient Register according to their ICD-10 code
(eTable 1 in the Supplement). These models adjusted for all
measured confounders. In addition, we performed a sensitiv-
ity analysis on a subsample born in 1987 or later and applied
the same models, including the sibling comparison, to exam-
ine whether the extended follow-up time for the oldest sub-
sample of the cohort until the introduction of ICD-10 in 1997
was a source of bias.
A post hoc Cox proportional hazards regression analysis
was used to determine the association between the number
of adverse perinatal events and the risk for OCD. All analyses
were conducted using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive characteristics of the study population are pre-
sented in Table 1. In total, 2 421 284 individuals were in-
cluded in the cohort; of these, 17 305 were diagnosed with OCD
during the study period, resulting in a Kaplan-Meier esti-
mated prevalence of 1.32% at age 40 years (eFigure in the
Supplement). The mean (SD) age at first diagnosis of OCD was
23.4 (6.5) years. The individuals with OCD differed signifi-
cantly from those without OCD in several aspects. For in-
stance, the proportion of women was significantly higher
comparedwithmenamongpersonswithOCD(58.9%vs41.1%;
P < .001). Those with OCD also had more comorbid disorders
than did those without OCD (37.9% vs 5%; P < .001). Of the
743 885 families with at least 2 children, 11 592 (15.6%) in-
cluded full siblings discordant for OCD.

Labor Presentation
Breech presentation was associated with an increased risk for
OCD (fully adjusted model: HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.15-1.39;
sibling comparison: HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.06-1.71) compared with
normal presentation (Table 2). A similar association was not
found for other malpresentations, neither in the fully ad-
justed model nor the sibling comparison model (Table 2).
Obstetric Delivery
There was a slightly increased risk of OCD among individuals
delivered by cesarean section (HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.04-1.15) and
assisted vaginal delivery (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.05-1.19) com-
pared with unassisted vaginal delivery in the fully adjusted
model (Table 2). In the sibling comparison models, these es-
timates remained similar in magnitude but had lower preci-
sion; the association with cesarean section remained statisti-
cally significant (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.01-1.34), whereas the
associationwithassistedvaginaldeliverydidnot(HR,1.07;95%
CI, 0.94-1.22) (Table 2).
Gestational Age
There was an inverse association between gestational age and
OCD that remained when we adjusted for potential confound-
ers (Table 2). Compared with those with term birth, the risk
for OCD in individuals with very preterm birth (<32 weeks) was
higher (HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.35-1.91) than in individuals with pre-
term birth (32-36 weeks: HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.12-1.28), indicat-
ing a dose-response association (Figure, A). The continuous

representation of gestational age displayed a pattern similar
to that of the ordinal representation (Figure, A). The results
of the sibling comparison yielded similar estimates but with
lower precision (very preterm birth: HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 0.97-
2.19; and preterm birth: HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.07-1.43) (Table 2
and Figure, A).
Birth Weight
The ordinal representation of birth weight showed an inverse
association with OCD that remained when we adjusted for all
measuredconfoundersaswellasgestationalage(knowntocor-
relate with birth weight34) (Table 2). Both low and high birth
weight were associated with a slightly increased risk for
OCD (eg, low birth weight [1501-2500 g]: HR, 1.10; 95% CI,
1-1.21; and high birth weight [>4500 g]: HR, 1.17; 95% CI,
1.07-1.27). The continuous representation mirrored these
results (Figure, B).
The results from the sibling comparison models yielded
higher estimates for low birth weights but with lower preci-
sion and followed a clearer dose-response association, with
the highest risk for very low birth weight (≤1500 g) (HR, 1.72;
95% CI, 0.94-3.14) (Table 2 and Figure, B). The estimate for
high birth weight (>4500 g) remained similar in magnitude
(HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.96-1.35). Analyses of both small- and
large-for-gestational age individuals followed the same pat-
tern in both the magnitude and precision of the estimates
(Table 2).
Apgar Score
At 5 minutes after delivery, infants with Apgar scores at dis-
tress(scores4-6)ornear-death(≤3)levelshadanincreasedrisk
ofOCDinboththefullyadjustedmodel(HR,1.28;95%CI,1.09-
1.51; and HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.03-1.90, respectively) and the sib-
ling comparison model (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.07-2.09; and HR,
1.68; 95% CI, 0.79-3.56, respectively) (Table 2) compared with
infants with normal Apgar scores. However, the precision was
low in the sibling comparison, especially for near-death scores,
which did not remain statistically significant.
Head Circumference
The small association between small head circumference and
OCD in the fully adjusted model (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1-1.14) did
not remain in the sibling comparison (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.84-
1.09) (Table 2). No association between large head circumfer-
ence and OCD was observed.
Sensitivity Analyses
The pattern of results remained largely unchanged when in-
dividuals with comorbid disorders were excluded from the
analyses (Table 3). Evaluation of the subsample of individu-
als born in 1987 or later (without an extended follow-up time
until the introduction of ICD-10) revealed a similar pattern but
with lower precision (eTable 2 in the Supplement); one excep-
tion was the association for breech presentation, which did not
remain in the sibling comparison.
Post Hoc Analyses: Number of Perinatal Events
A dose-response association between the number of adverse
perinataleventsandincreasedriskforOCDwasobserved.Haz-
ard ratios ranged from 1.11 (95% CI, 1.07-1.15) for 1 event to 1.51
(95% CI, 1.18-1.94) for 5 or more events (Table 4).
Discussion
In this large study of the entire Swedish population, we found
that several perinatal factors were associated with a higher risk
ofdevelopingOCD,confirmingandextendingtheresultsofthe
few previous small and often retrospective studies.3,11-17 These
associations largely remained when genetic and environmen-
tal factors shared by siblings were taken into account, con-
founders were strictly controlled, and relevant comorbidities
wereexcluded.Theassociationsforpretermbirthandlowbirth
weight were further supported by dose-response associa-
tions consistent with causal inference. A dose-response asso-
ciation was also identified for the number of perinatal events,
whereby the higher the number of events, the greater the risk
of OCD.

The specific mechanism linking OCD and maternal smok-
ing, complicated birth, preterm birth, fetal growth, and dis-
tress at birth remains to be identified. However, these find-
ingsareinlinewiththefetalprogramminghypothesis,positing
that adaptation to the fetal environment may lead to adverse
effects in subsequent life.35,36 An adverse fetal environment
or insult (eg, hypoxia-ischemia, white matter injury, reduced
blood flow, malnutrition, and differences in development of
the serotonergic system) has been observed37-39 to affect brain
development. It also has been shown39,40 that variations in fe-
tal growth are associated with brain development well into
childhood and adolescence. Research into differences in brain
structure and function between people with and without the
associations identified in the present study may reveal the me-
diating biological pathways.
Rather than being unique to OCD, many of these perina-
tal risk factors may be shared across a range of neuropsychi-
atric disorders. For instance, using similar family designs,
studies have shown associations between low birth weight
and ADHD and autism9,10,41 as well as between gestational
age and autism, ADHD, and psychotic or bipolar disorders.7
These findings contradict the widely held notion that,

although mental disorders share genetic risk factors, the
contribution of environmental risk factors is largely disorder
specific.42-44 One exception to this lack of specificity may be
our finding of an increased risk of OCD in children exposed
to maternal smoking during pregnancy. This finding was
unexpected since other family-based studies20,45 have sug-
gested that the causal inference between maternal smoking
during pregnancy and a range of adverse outcomes in off-
spring (eg, ADHD, criminality, academic achievement, drug
use, adolescent antisocial behavior, adolescent psychologi-
cal functioning, suicidal behavior, childhood conduct prob-
lems, and intellectual abilities) has been overstated. The
results of the present study indicate a relatively small, yet
robust association between maternal smoking during preg-
nancy and OCD, even after controlling for familial confound-
ing. If replicated, these findings may have important impli-
cations for future research, for example, using relevant
animal models.
To our knowledge, this is the first study examining a broad
rangeofperinatalriskfactorsforOCDusingalarge,population-
based cohort with prospectively collected data during preg-
nancy and at the time of birth. By comparing clusters of full
siblings discordant for OCD, we could control for many (un-
measured) shared familial confounders (genetic and environ-
mental).ThevalidityandreliabilityoftheSwedishICD-10codes
for OCD have been well established.32
Some limitations of the study need to be considered. The
cohort is weighted toward more severe cases and does not rep-
resent the totality of all patients with OCD in Sweden. There
are missing cases because many individuals do not seek help,
coverage of the Swedish National Patient Register between
1997 and 2001 is incomplete, and patients diagnosed with
OCD by general practitioners and other nonspecialists are not
included. Sibling comparisons can help in inferring, but not
proving, causality and have lower statistical power compared
with population-based estimates.33 Furthermore, sibling com-
parison designs are sensitive to random measurement error in
the exposure and may be biased owing to variables shared
by siblings that are related to the exposure but not the
outcome.20,46 The sibling comparison also assumes that there
are no carryover effects from one pregnancy to a later
pregnancy.46,47 Adjusting for parity addresses this limitation,
but just partially. Monozygotic twin comparison studies could
cement these findings further, controlling also for potential
evocative genetic and more shared environmental factors, but
would be limited to exposures that are not shared by monozy-
gotic twins.
Conclusions
In the present study, we found that perinatal factors, espe-
cially maternal smoking during pregnancy, breech presenta-
tion, cesarean section, preterm birth, low birth weight, being
large for gestational age, and Apgar distress scores, were as-
sociated with a higher risk of developing OCD independent of
shared familial confounders and several other measured co-
variates. A dose-response association was also identified for
the number of perinatal events, with an increasingly higher
number of events associated with a greater risk for OCD. The
findings are important for the understanding of the cause of
OCD and will inform future studies of gene by environment
interaction and epigenetics. If the finding is replicated, the as-
sociation between maternal smoking during pregnancy and
OCD may emerge as an interesting disorder-specific risk fac-
tor for evaluation in future research.

a All measured perinatal events are included. The events were defined as
follows: heavy (�10 cigarettes per day) maternal smoking during pregnancy,
any labor presentation other than normal, any obstetric delivery other than
unassisted vaginal delivery, gestational age less than 37 weeks, birth weight
2500 g or less, being small or large for gestational age, Apgar score less than 7,
and small or large head circumference. Maternal smoking during pregnancy
was included even though the variable was not introduced in the Swedish
Medical Birth Register until 1982, but running analyses on the entire cohort
excluding smoking, and on a subsample of those born from 1982 and later,
revealed virtually no differences in the estimates.
