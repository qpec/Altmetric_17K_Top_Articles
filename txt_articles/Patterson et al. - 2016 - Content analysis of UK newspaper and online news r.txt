ABSTRACT
Objectives: In the UK, men’s alcohol-related morbidity
and mortality still greatly exceeds women’s, despite an
increase in women’s alcohol consumption in recent
decades. New UK alcohol guidelines introduce gender-
neutral low-risk alcohol consumption guidance. This
study explores how UK newspaper and online news
represent women’s and men’s ‘binge’ drinking to
identify opportunities to better align reporting of
harmful drinking with evidence.
Design: Quantitative and qualitative content analysis of
308 articles published in 7 UK national newspapers and
the BBC News website between 1 January 2012 and 31
December 2013.
Results: Articles associated women with ‘binge’
drinking more frequently than men, and presented
women’s drinking as more problematic. Men were more
frequently characterised as violent or disorderly, while
women were characterised as out of control, putting
themselves in danger, harming their physical
appearance and burdening men. Descriptions of female
‘binge’ drinkers’ clothing and appearance were typically
moralistic.
Conclusions: The UK news media’s disproportionate
focus on women’s ‘binge’ drinking is at odds with
epidemiological evidence, may reproduce harmful
gender stereotypes and may obstruct public
understandings of the gender-neutral weekly
consumption limits in newly proposed alcohol
guidelines. In order to better align reporting of harmful
drinking with current evidence, public health advocates
may engage with the media with a view to shifting
media framing of ‘binge’ drinking away from specific
groups (young people; women) and contexts (public
drinking) and towards the health risks of specific
drinking behaviours, which affect all groups regardless
of context.
INTRODUCTION
While the gap between women’s and men’s
excessive and harmful consumption of alcohol
in the UK has narrowed in recent years,1 men
still drink more than women,2 experience
more drink-related health and social problems
and face twice women’s alcohol-related mortal-
ity (15.9–7.8 deaths per 100 000 population,
respectively, in 2012).2 National guidelines
have typically issued different alcohol con-
sumption guidance for men and women, with
women being advised to drink less than men,
but the UK have recently joined Australia and
Portugal3 4 in issuing the same low-risk con-
sumption guidance for men and women,
drawing on evidence that the health risks
posed to each gender are similar at low-risk
levels of consumption.5 In light of this shift
towards gender neutrality in alcohol consump-
tion guidelines, it is timely to consider how
gender differences in drinking behaviours are
represented and perceived.
Strengths and limitations of this study
▪ Quantitative and qualitative content analysis of a
large, comprehensive, 2-year sample of UK
national newspaper news and online news about
‘binge’ drinking.
▪ The findings illustrate how media portrayals of
‘binge’ drinking could be harmful, and identify
opportunities for these portrayals to be better
aligned with evidence.
▪ Content analysis facilitates understandings of the
messages being presented to the public, but
cannot determine the extent to which audiences’
understandings are influenced by media repre-
sentations of specific issues.
▪ Some findings may have differed if the data ana-
lysed had gone beyond text articles, for example,
by incorporating images, video and social media
content.

 As with most health issues, popular perceptions of
drinking are likely to be influenced by mass media
representations,6–8 and, in turn, differences in represen-
tations of women’s and men’s drinking are heavily influ-
enced by how societies regulate gender roles.9 Media
content analysis cannot tell us if, and how, specific
content influences audiences’ understandings and beha-
viours, and content analysis findings must be considered
with that inherent limitation in mind. Nonetheless,
exploring media representations of men’s and women’s
drinking behaviours allows us to examine how shared
cultural values around alcohol are articulated and con-
structed,10 which might inform efforts to improve media
representations, and therefore public understandings, of
harmful drinking behaviours.11
Research illustrates a clear gender divide in media
portrayals of drinking behaviours, with men’s drinking
normalised and women’s problematised. Day et al12
found that UK newspapers frequently characterised
women as departing from idealised notions of femininity
in terms of appearance (eg, weight gain, deeper voices,
loss of good looks) and motherhood (eg, reduced fertil-
ity and unborn children). They found that men were
framed as violent, but partial responsibility for men’s vio-
lence was attributed to women, who were framed as
sexual predators invading traditionally male-dominated
drinking environments. Conversely, Wood et al13 found
that UK newspaper coverage of proposed minimum unit
pricing (MUP) policies presented women as being at
‘risk of harm’ from male aggression. Lyons et al14 found
that both young women’s and young men’s magazines
framed binge drinking as normative, adult and profes-
sional, with young men’s magazines associating men’s
drinking with traditional masculine images and deriding
young women’s drinking behaviours. Nicholls15 found
that UK television and newspaper news associated men’s
drinking
with
violence
(both
as
perpetrators
and
victims) and women’s drunkenness with unfeminine and
undignified behaviours, such as loss of consciousness or
partial nudity. Similarly, Atkinson et al16 found that UK
magazines
targeted
at
teenagers
depicted
women’s
drinking as more problematic than men’s, and portrayed
women as ‘behaving like men’ in male spaces, sexualised
and highly emotional.
As Nicholls15 found, ‘binge drinking’, also called
single-episodic drinking, is a key focus of media repre-
sentations of harmful drinking; “problem drinking is less
commonly associated with dependence and more com-
monly associated with binge, harmful and hazardous
drinking”. Herring et al17 describe binge drinking as a
‘confused concept’ that has historically been, and con-
tinues to be, defined inconsistently. They suggest that
‘binge’ drinking is currently portrayed as a youth issue,
despite evidence that single-episodic drinking is per-
formed by various age groups,2 highlighting a potential
area of media misrepresentation of population drinking
behaviours. Qualitative evidence indicates that young
women in Scotland define ‘binge’ drinking in terms of
types of behaviour rather than the quantity of alcohol
consumed,18 which may present an obstacle to clearly
and objectively defining ‘binge’ drinking. Mixed-method
evidence suggests that both male and female students in
England perceive binge drinking and public drunken-
ness as masculine behaviours.19 Two studies based on
qualitative data from New Zealand have highlighted the
role of alcohol-related behaviours in young people’s
gender identities. First, Willott and Lyons20 found that
young men and women perceived consuming large
quantities of alcohol in a single episode (among other
behaviours) as a key performance of masculinity, and
highlighted the identity negotiations undertaken by
men who do not engage in these normative, masculine
drinking behaviours. Second, Hutton et al21 examined
the challenges that young women experience in curating
social media personae that balance engagement in ‘the
culture of intoxication’ (ref. 21, p. 88) with maintaining
respectability. Given the primacy of binge drinking in
UK media coverage of harmful alcohol use,15 binge
drinking is an important lens through which to examine
gendered representations of drinking behaviours.
This
study
comprises
a
comprehensive,
mixed-
methods content analysis of 2 years of UK media cover-
age of binge drinking, designed to contribute new
insights into a growing body of literature about gen-
dered media representations of alcohol, with a particu-
lar focus on binge drinking. Our aim is to improve
understandings of UK newspaper and online news repre-
sentations of women’s and men’s ‘binge’ drinking, focus-
ing not on how ‘binge’ drinking is defined, but rather
on how different types of drinking behaviour are gen-
dered in media content where those behaviours are
labelled as ‘binge’ drinking. While the limitations of
media content analysis must be taken into account, the
improved understandings produced by this research may
help to inform efforts to better align media representa-
tions of harmful drinking with current evidence, which
could in turn improve public understandings of the risks
of single-episodic drinking.
METHODS
We selected seven highly circulated22
23 UK national
newspapers, including their Sunday counterparts, and
the most-read exclusively online news website24 (table 1).
The chosen newspaper publications represented three
genres: quality, middle-market tabloid and tabloid. This
typology helps to ensure a sample that represents diverse
readerships in terms of age, social class and political
alignment.25 Quality newspapers are those that were trad-
itionally printed in broadsheet format, have predomin-
antly middle-class audiences, are politically diverse and
are serious in tone. Middle-market tabloids are printed in
tabloid format and are less serious in tone than quality-
genre newspapers, and have a predominantly older,
middle-class,
right-wing
audience.
Tabloids
are
less
serious and typically more sensationalist than middle-

 market tabloids, are politically diverse and have predom-
inantly working-class audiences.
We selected a search period of 1 January 2012 to 31
December 2013, during which alcohol was subject to
heightened media interest due to debates in the UK and
Scottish parliaments around MUP
.26 Much of the media
coverage of MUP was related to ‘binge’ drinking due to
the UK Government’s Alcohol Strategy27 overtly posi-
tioning ‘binge’ drinking as the primary target of MUP
.
Relevant newspaper articles were identified using the
Nexis database including articles from online editions of
the two of the selected publications (The Guardian and
The Daily Mail) that are archived in Nexis. BBC News
articles were identified using the search function on the
BBC website. The search string identified articles that
contain both three or more mentions of ‘binge’ and
one or more mentions of ‘drink OR drinker OR drin-
kers OR drinking’. Duplicate articles were removed, and
articles were manually excluded if they did not predom-
inantly focus on binge drinking in the UK, or if they
were not in the news, feature or editorial formats. Initial
searches identified 537 articles, of which 308 met the
inclusion criteria and were eligible for detailed coding
and analysis.
To
systematically
and
comprehensively
code
and
analyse the media content, we used a mixed-methods
content analysis. First, we used quantitative content ana-
lysis to measure the frequency of content within the arti-
cles across the whole sample, and second, we performed
qualitative content analysis of the content of a sub-
sample of articles for more in-depth, reflexive analysis.28
From this perspective, quantitative content analysis is
concerned
with
measuring
and
analysing
manifest
content (the surface-level content of the articles, the
coding of which does not require interpretation on the
part of the coder such that it can be recorded relatively
objectively), while qualitative content analysis is con-
cerned with latent content (the underlying meanings of
the text, as interpreted by coders in an inherently
subjective process).29 The mixed-methods approach in
this research comprised the following steps: constructing
a coding frame; coding manifest content using the
coding frame; establishing the reliability of the data col-
lected and excluding unreliable data; analysing the
quantitative data; identifying aspects of manifest content
to examine further using qualitative analysis; and finally
performing thematic analysis of the latent content of
articles containing the manifest content of interest.
To construct a coding frame with which to code mani-
fest content, SH and CE read randomly selected articles
from the sample in batches of 20, recording potential
thematic categories relevant to the research topic as they
emerged. At the point where a batch of articles was read
without any new categories emerging, the list of categor-
ies was deemed to have reached saturation. The col-
lected thematic categories were grouped into three
broad
thematic
categories:
How
is
binge
drinking
described and which sections of the population are asso-
ciated with this behaviour?; How are the drivers of the
binge drinking described and who is to blame?; and
What are the consequences of binge drinking? These
categories were chosen by a combination of a priori
knowledge of the research topic and understandings of
the content of the sample that emerged from close
reading of the articles.26 The final coding frame com-
prised the three broad thematic categories and their
subcategories, as well as fields to record more routine
details of articles, such as publication, article format and
word count. In addition, coders recorded whether each
article mentioned men and women, allowing articles to
be divided into four gender categories: those that
mention women exclusively, those that mention men
exclusively, those that mention both men and women
and those that mention neither men nor women expli-
citly. These codes enabled analysis of whether themes
varied by the gender focus of articles.
To collect quantitative data, OM read each article in
turn, using the coding frame to record whether each

 theme was present within its manifest content. To ensure
consistency of coding, GF coded a random subsample of
39 articles (12.7%). Linearly weighted κ tests of inter-
rater agreement between OM and GF were then per-
formed on each variable across those 39 double-coded
articles, and variables that returned a coefficient below
0.8 were discarded from the study to ensure that only
variables with strong agreement were retained for ana-
lysis. The coding frame data were then entered into
SPSS for analysis. Statistical procedures comprised: a
simple linear regression examining the relationship
between publication quarter and the count of articles
published; χ2 tests of whether thematic variables varied
by gender focus, publication genre or article format;
and paired t-tests comparing the means of thematic vari-
ables. The threshold of statistical significance is set at
0.01 throughout to mitigate the risk of type 1 errors.
Following quantitative analysis, the thematic category
of ‘harms to appearance’ was deemed noteworthy and
suitable for qualitative coding and analysis. The decision
to focus on that theme was informed by stark gender dif-
ferences in content that emerged from the quantitative
analysis, and an expectation that valuable understand-
ings could be gained from deeper analysis. To analyse
the latent content of the 46 articles that had been coded
as mentioning ‘harms to appearance’, GF and CP
employed a thematic analysis approach30 using NVivo
V.10, closely reading each article to generate initial
codes, which were then collated into potential themes.
GF and CP collaborated closely to assure that the
themes were defined clearly and that they worked across
the 46 articles. The findings from the thematic analysis
are presented in terms of two broad themes, using
typical quotations to illustrate article content.
RESULTS
Quantitative findings
Between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2013, 308
articles about binge drinking were published in the
seven print publications and one website included in the
sample. Of these articles, 86 (27.9%) were published in
‘quality’
newspapers,
39
(12.7%)
in
middle-market
tabloids, 75 (24.4%) in tabloids and 108 (35.1%) on
BBC News (table 1). The majority of articles were stand-
ard news format (n=237, 76.9%), while 52 (16.9%) were
feature articles and 19 (6.2%) editorials. The frequency
of articles published per quarter decreased across the
2-year period (figure 1), but publication quarter was not
a statistically significant predictor of article frequency
(coefficient −6.714, p=0.088). There was a peak of 56
articles in March 2012, 66.1% of which were related to
MUP
, in particular the UK Prime Minister’s announce-
ment of plans to introduce MUP
. There was elevated
reporting from November 2012 to January 2013 (n=62),
during which 53.2% of articles mentioned MUP
, largely
related to opposition to MUP within the UK Cabinet. In
total, 133 (43.2%) articles mentioned MUP
.
Articles were coded according to whether they men-
tioned binge drinking in women exclusively (n=68,
22.1%), men exclusively (n=30, 9.7%), both men and
women (n=43, 14.0%), or neither men nor women
explicitly (n=167, 54.2%). To be coded as mentioning
both men and women, an article had to include specific
discussion of each gender individually. There were no
significant associations between gender category and
either genre (p=0.382) or article format (p=0.303).
Furthermore,
neither
publication
genre
nor
article
format was significantly associated with differences in
reporting on any of the thematic categories listed in
table 2.
Articles were coded to identify the characteristics of
binge drinkers and the specific drinks associated with
binge drinking. Thirty-two (10.4%) of all 308 articles
associated mothers (including pregnant women) with
binge drinking, which differed significantly (p<0.000)
from the 11 (3.6%) that mentioned fathers (table 2).
There
were
no
statistically
significant
relationships
between gender focus and mentioning either younger
or older people. While more articles that mentioned
binge drinking in the home were focused exclusively on
women, no drinking location was significantly associated
with gender category (table 2). Wine (n=58, 18.8%) was
the only type of drink significantly associated more with
one gender than the other, being predominantly men-
tioned
in
articles
focusing
exclusively
on
women
(p=0.004).
Almost two-thirds of articles (n=192, 62.3%) described
health harms related to binge drinking, while one-
quarter (n=77) mentioned risk of death. Mentions of
specific categories of harm were recorded (table 2), and
relationships between gender and specific harms were
identified. Mentioning harms to appearance was signifi-
cantly related to gender category (p=0.001); 19 of the
46 articles that mentioned harms to appearance men-
tioned women exclusively, while none of those 46 arti-
cles mentioned men exclusively. Harms to parenting
were mentioned in 7 (10.3%) of the 68 articles that
exclusively mentioned women, and none that exclusively
mentioned men, but the difference was not significant
(p=0.068). Sexual assault and rape were mentioned
more
frequently
in
articles
exclusively
mentioning
women (n=9, 2.9%) than those exclusively mentioning
men (n=4, 13.3%), but not significantly so (p=0.989).
More articles directly associated the risk of death from
drinking with men (n=16, 20.8%) than with women
(n=8,
10.4%),
and
this
difference
was
significant
(p<0.000). Conversely, non-fatal physical health harms
were associated with women (n=32, 23.2%) more fre-
quently than men (n=11, 8.0%), albeit not significantly
so (p=0.339).
Qualitative findings
As identified in the quantitative findings, just 8 of the 46
articles that reported on ‘harms to appearance’ men-
tioned men, and none did so exclusively. These 46

BMJ Open: first published as 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-013124 on 27 December 2016. Downloaded from 
 articles were subjected to thematic analysis. A broad con-
ceptualisation of ‘harms to appearance’ was used that
included behavioural as well as aesthetic aspects of phys-
ical appearance that may be influenced (or perceived to
be influenced) by single-episodic drinking. Using this
broad definition, two key themes emerged from the-
matic analysis of the subsample: physical appearance
and loss of self-control.
Physical appearance
Various harms to complexion were reported in relation
to women, including the use of make-up to hide grey
skin. Articles described specific damage to women’s fea-
tures, including hair, lips, noses and teeth, as well as
using less specific descriptions of physical damage such
as ‘ravaged’ (The Sun, 13 February 2012). An article
headlined ‘Lambrini ruined my looks in 5 months’ (The
Sun, 27 September 2013) associated an ‘attractive’
woman becoming ‘a swollen, haggard wreck’ with the
consumption of a perry overtly marketed to young
women. Weight gain caused by alcohol consumption was
cited as both a product of alcohol use and a cause of
‘drunkorexia’, the practice of eating less to offset cal-
ories gained from alcoholic drinks.31 Drunkorexia was
typically associated with women; one article stated that it
‘affects mainly young women’ (Daily Mail, 19 July 2012)
while another defined it as a condition in which ‘calorie-
conscious women skip meals in order to binge drink’
(Mirror, 20 December 2012).
Within the few articles in the subsample that men-
tioned men, male partial nudity was related to drunken
behaviours,
such
as
lost
and
ripped
clothes,
and
intentional indecent exposure. Typifying this, the Daily
Mail described a male student ‘flashing his penis in the
street and laughing at his own loutish behaviour’ (19
June 2012). Conversely, partial nudity in women was
more typically related to clothing choices presumably
made while sober, with descriptions of revealing cloth-
ing, particularly miniskirts, and impractical shoes. One
article described a fancy dress event in which ‘under-
graduate girls take to the streets dressed in little more
than their underwear’ (Daily Mail, 8 October 2012).
Women were variously described as ‘scantily-clad’ (Daily
Mail, 22 August 2012), ‘half-naked’ (The Sun, 3 March
2013) and ‘nearly bearing all’ (Daily Mail, 8 October
2012). Aside from choices of attire made in sobriety,
harms to appearance that could befall women during
drinking episodes included smeared makeup, vomit in
hair, stained clothes and gravel embedded in knees.
Articles also made mention of unintentional exposure of
underwear or body parts by women, which was in con-
trast to men, who were typically described as exposed
their genitalia deliberately.
Loss of self-control
Descriptions of women’s and men’s loss of physical
control
differed.
Some
articles
depicted
drunken
women as burdening male partners. For example, two
articles described women vomiting on their boyfriends,
while one described female students needing ‘to be
carried back to their rooms by boyfriends’ (Daily Mail,
19 June 2012). No articles characterised ‘binge’ drinking
men as relying on, or burdening, their partners.

 Women’s aggressive behaviours were limited to verbal
conflict, with drunken women characterised as noisy,
argumentative, emotional and hard to control. An article
describing
Cardiff
nightlife
reported
that
drunken
women ‘scream at their boyfriends in shop doorways’ and
‘sob in public’ (Daily Mail, 21 August 2012). Men were
more typically associated with aggressive behaviours,
including violent language and actions, damaging prop-
erty and non-specific ‘loutish’ (Daily Mail, 19 June 2012)
behaviour. While male aggression was presented as
endangering
others,
women
were
characterised
as
putting themselves at risk, sometimes of undesirable
sexual situations and assault. One article reproduced
Office of National Statistics data about fines for drunk
and disorderly behaviour, presenting men as much more
likely than women to receive such fines, but suggesting
that the number of women receiving the fines is increas-
ing more rapidly than men (Telegraph, 14 June 2009).

 DISCUSSION
We examined UK newspaper and online news represen-
tations of ‘binge’ drinking, exploring differences and
similarities in representations of women’s and men’s
drinking behaviours. Our quantitative analysis identified
that women were associated with binge drinking more
frequently than men, which conflicts with epidemio-
logical evidence2 and young people’s perceptions of
‘binge’ drinking as a masculine activity.19 We found
various differences in how binge drinking was repre-
sented
in
association
with
different
genders.
Motherhood was mentioned in relation to ‘binge’ drink-
ing more frequently than fatherhood. There were signifi-
cant gender differences in the attribution of health
harms, with male ‘binge’ drinking frequently associated
with mortality and female ‘binge’ drinking more fre-
quently associated with morbidity. Women’s drinking was
typically presented as more problematic than men’s, and
notably, harms to appearance were associated with
women’s ‘binge’ drinking much more frequently than
men’s. The articles in our sample associated wine with
women’s ‘binge’ drinking significantly more than men’s,
but our data did not identify significant gender associa-
tions with other specific types of drink.
Our qualitative analysis focused on depictions of the
relationship between ‘binge’ drinking and appearance,
comprising aspects of physical appearance and behav-
iour. Women engaged in ‘binge’ drinking were pre-
sented
as
helpless,
physically
incapacitated
and
transgressive, and as burdens to male partners, who were
sometimes cast as carers for drunken women. ‘Binge’
drinking men were associated with physical and verbal
aggression, but not behaviours that marked them as
weak or vulnerable; while women were characterised as
endangering
themselves,
men
were
more
likely
to
endanger others. Articles typically depicted women as
less able than men to maintain socially acceptable behav-
iour during single-episodic drinking. ‘Binge’ drinking
was characterised as affecting women’s physical appear-
ance more than men’s. Articles associated binge drink-
ing with both immediate and long-term damage to
physical
characteristics
and
self-presentation.
Descriptions of binge drinking women’s dress had a
moralistic tone that was absent in representations of
men, with articles typically focusing on degrees of nudity
and implicitly questioning the propriety of women’s
chosen attire. Our analysis suggests that media represen-
tations of women’s ‘binge’ drinking do not focus solely
on the effects of binge drinking on women, but also
reflect
broader
social
expectations
about
women’s
public behaviours.
Measham and Østergaard32 suggest that newspapers
have constructed ‘binge’ drinking as a problem of young
women adopting male behaviours:
The public face of binge drinking, […] a staple of early
21st century tabloid newspapers, became the young
woman emulating male consumption patterns […] with
clothes askew stumbling around the city centre streets at
night’.(p. 417)
There may be unintended consequences of this dis-
proportionate focus on women’s—as opposed to men’s
—single-episodic
drinking
in
media
reports.
For
example, it may reinforce harmful gender stereotypes by
suggesting that drinking is more problematic for women
than men, and may encourage victim blaming in rela-
tion to sexual assaults after drinking.33 It is notable that
the media’s disproportionately frequent association of
women with single-episodic drinking in our sample is at
odds with young adults’ perceptions of these types of
drinking behaviours as being masculine.19 20 One poten-
tial explanation for this is that news producers regard
women’s ‘binge’ drinking as being of greater interest
than men’s because it is a deviation from gender norms.
Whether disproportionate media focus on women’s
single-episodic
drinking might
influence
a
shift
in
public perceptions of how such behaviours correspond
to gender identities may be a question for further
research.
Our findings build on the growing body of literature
about gendered media representations of alcohol by
focusing specifically on portrayals of binge drinking.
Depictions of women as unable to control themselves
physically
and
emotionally
echoed
the
findings
of
Atkinson et al,16 while the burden this weakness was
depicted as placing on men could be seen as corroborat-
ing Day et al12 finding that traditionally male-dominated
drinking environments and activities are perceived to be
threatened by women’s increasing involvement. Day
et als12 finding that women were presented as making
themselves vulnerable to male aggression was replicated
in our finding that articles presented women as in
danger, and men as dangerous. The depictions of
women’s dress and behaviours found in our analysis
echoed Nicholls’15 findings. We found that whole or
partial nudity in males was typically presented as friv-
olous or ridiculous, while women’s partial nudity was
presented with an underlying morally loaded tone,
perhaps resulting from women being perceived as publi-
cally breaking social conventions.
Our analysis supports Herring et al’s17 observation that
‘binge’ drinking is popularly conceived in terms of spe-
cific social contexts, rather than being defined purely in
terms of exceeding a certain quantity of alcohol in a
limited time. Media framing of ‘binge’ drinking as an
activity of young men and women, often in public
spaces, disproportionately emphasises the context of
single-episodic drinking and contributes to constructing
binge drinking as something many (including older
people or those who drink in private settings) might not
associate themselves with. The disproportionate associ-
ation of ‘binge’ drinking with young peoples’ public,
often antisocial (although performed within in social
groups), drinking could have a damaging influence if it
leads those who engage in single-episodic drinking

 outside of these contexts to misidentify their behaviours
as harmless. The dominant narrative of ‘binge’ drinking
may have become unhelpful as a health concept. As an
alternative, it may be useful to draw a clear distinction in
health communications between ‘binge drinking’, as an
inconsistently defined, context-specific and value-laden
term, and single-episodic drinking, as a specific, wide-
spread and context-independent practice with a range
of
health
consequences
documented
by
research
evidence.
Our findings have relevance to the development of
alcohol
guidelines.
While
the
new
UK
guidelines
propose gender-neutral low-risk consumption guidelines,
the Department of Health acknowledges that men and
women vary in their drinking behaviours and the long-
term and short-term health risks they face.5 Media asso-
ciations
of
men
with
alcohol-related
mortality and
women with alcohol-related morbidity are in line with
epidemiological evidence.5 However, differences in how
media
coverage
problematises
women’s
and
men’s
‘binge’ drinking could promote perceptions of men’s
‘binge’ drinking as less harmful than women’s, poten-
tially exacerbating men’s harmful drinking behaviours
and hindering public understandings and acceptance of
the proposed guidelines.
Our conclusions are subject to limitations. While mass
media’s influence on public perceptions of health issues
is extensively researched and well established,6 content
analysis alone cannot determine the extent to which
audiences’ understandings correlate with media repre-
sentations; audiences are subject to many influences
beyond print and online news media, and do not
consume media content in a passive, non-critical way.
Studying other forms of media, such as television or
social media, could help create a more complete under-
standing of media representations of ‘binge’ drinking.
Furthermore, a larger sample size, achieved by choosing
a longer timeframe or including more publications,
could have increased the validity of our conclusions. A
potential limitation of the data used is that the Nexis
database stores articles in text-only format, omitting any
images included in the original articles. Coders noted
that text-only articles that appear factual and impartial
could be perceived as more morally loaded with the ori-
ginal photographs included. Similarly, some articles may
only reveal implicit gender bias when viewed with the
original photographs included; this is illustrated in an
article about ‘binge’ drinking on The Sun’s website that
contains seven images of women drinking and none of
men, while the text makes no mention of gender.34
Finally, as the article search period concluded 2 years
prior to the proposal of new alcohol guidelines, our ana-
lysis cannot tell us how representations changed immedi-
ately
preceding,
during
or
following
the
proposal.
Further research might analyse how media coverage of
alcohol
guidelines
represents
‘binge’
drinking
and
gender roles. Alternatively, comparative research could
investigate
whether
media
representations
differed
before and after the introduction of new guidelines.
With these limitations taken into account, this compre-
hensive content analysis of a 2-year period of coverage
contributes to understandings of gendered media repre-
sentations of drinking, with a specific focus on ‘binge’
drinking.
In conclusion, our analysis suggests that popular repre-
sentations of binge drinking may be harmful in three
ways. First, if public audiences’ understandings are influ-
enced by media coverage of ‘binge’ drinking, associa-
tions of ‘binge’ drinking with certain demographics and
situations could lead the public to underestimate the
health risks of single-episodic drinking among those not
typically depicted in ‘binge’ drinking narratives, particu-
larly older people. Morally loaded representations of
women’s binge drinking may reproduce harmful stereo-
types and stigma about the vulnerability of drunken
women and the social unacceptability of female drunk-
enness. Finally, media content reinforcing a skewed rep-
resentation of binge drinking may present a challenge
to
public
health
stakeholders
seeking
to
promote
evidence-based information, recommendations and pol-
icies with the goal of reducing alcohol-related health
harms.
The misrepresentations identified by this research
suggest that there may be a need for health advocates to
engage
with
mass
media
to
promote
clear,
evidence-informed messages about single-episodic drink-
ing to help better align reporting on harmful drinking
with evidence, with the ultimate goal of improving
public understandings of harmful drinking behaviours.
Media communication strategies may seek to avoid
stereotypes of ‘binge drinking’ that implicitly define
binge drinking in terms of social contexts and beha-
viours not directly related to alcohol consumption,
instead offering clear, value-free definitions of single-
episodic drinking based on specific quantities of alcohol
and specific, time-bound episodes. Identifying the need
to improve communication of single-episodic drinking is
particularly relevant given the recent public consultation
about
new
alcohol
guidelines,5
and
the
UK
Government’s decision not to include specific guidance
on single-occasion alcohol consumption within the final
guidelines.
