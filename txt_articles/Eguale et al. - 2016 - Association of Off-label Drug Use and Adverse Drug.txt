IMPORTANCE Off-label use of prescription drugs has been identified as an important
contributor to preventable adverse drug events (ADEs) in children. Despite concerns
regarding adverse outcomes, to date, no systematic investigation of the effects of off-label
drug use in adult populations has been performed.
OBJECTIVE To monitor and evaluate off-label use of prescription drugs and its effect on ADEs
in an adult population.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A cohort of 46 021 patients who received 151 305
incident prescribed drugs was assembled from primary care clinics in Quebec, Canada, using
the Medical Office of the XXIst Century electronic health record, which supports
documentation of treatment indications and treatment outcomes. Prescriptions dispensed
from January 1, 2005, through December 30, 2009, were followed up from the date of the
prescription to the date the drug use was discontinued, the end of treatment, or the end of
follow-up (December 30, 2010). Data were analyzed from January 5, 2012, to March 15, 2015.
EXPOSURES Off-label prescription drug use with and without strong scientific evidence.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Adverse drug events in off-label use with and without
strong scientific evidence. Analysis used multivariate marginal Cox proportional hazards
regression for clustered data with the drug as the unit of analysis.
RESULTS A total of 3484 ADEs were found in the 46 021 study patients, with an incidence
rate of 13.2 per 10 000 person-months. The rate of ADEs for off-label use (19.7 per 10 000
person-months) was higher than that for on-label use (12.5 per 10 000 person-months)
(adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 1.44; 95% CI, 1.30-1.60). Off-label use lacking strong scientific
evidence had a higher ADE rate (21.7 per 10 000 person-months) compared with on-label
use (AHR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.37-1.72). However, off-label use with strong scientific evidence had
the same risk for ADEs as on-label use (AHR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.88-1.38). The risks for ADEs were
higher for drugs approved from 1981 to 1995 (14.4 per 10 000 person-months; AHR, 1.62;
95% CI, 1.45-1.80) and for those used by women (14.3 per 10 000 person-months; AHR, 1.17;
95% CI, 1.06-1.28), patients receiving 5 to 7 drugs (12.1 per 10 000 person-months; AHR,
3.23; 95% CI, 2.66-3.92), and patients receiving cardiovascular drugs (15.9 per 10 000
person-months; AHR, 3.30; 95% CI, 2.67-4.08) and anti-infectives (66.2 per 10 000
person-months; AHR, 6.33; 95% CI, 4.58-8.76). Patients with a 1-unit increase in the
continuity of care index had a 19% increase in ADEs (AHR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.12-1.26).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Off-label use of prescription drugs is associated with ADEs.
Caution should be exercised in prescribing drugs for off-label uses that lack strong scientific
evidence. Future electronic health records should be designed to enable postmarket
surveillance of treatment indications and treatment outcomes to monitor the safety of on-
and off-label uses of drugs.

TheInstituteofMedicineanddrugregulatoryagencieshave
envisioned a postmarket surveillance system in which pat-
ternsofdruguse,indicationsfortheuse(on-andoff-label),and
associated ADEs could be tracked.8-10 However, an explicit link
between prescribed drugs and their indication is rarely docu-
mented, making it challenging to measure off-label use and its
effects.11 Recently, methods to support the documentation of
treatment indication, reasons for discontinuation of treat-
mentorders,andADEshavebeendeveloped,andevidencesup-
ports requiring these elements in electronic prescription.12,13
These new features provide a unique opportunity to monitor
and evaluate off-label use and its effect on ADEs systemati-
cally. The results from such monitoring can provide impor-

Methods
Context
The study was conducted in Quebec, Canada, a province that
provides health insurance for all 8.5 million residents. In 2003,
theMedicalOfficeoftheXXIstCentury(MOXXI),acommunity-
based clinical information system, was created to link benefi-
ciary, medical billing, and pharmacy claim data to create a lon-
gitudinalelectronichealthrecord(EHR)forpatients.16Evidence
of validity for the data has been shown, and these data have
been used frequently for health services and epidemiologic
research.17 One hundred thirteen primary care physicians par-
ticipate in the MOXXI research program, and these physi-
ciansworkinoffice-basedpracticesinMontrealorQuebecCity.
TheMOXXIdataoverrepresentolderpatientsandpatientswith
frequent physician visits.16
In the MOXXI EHR, physicians must document the treat-
ment indication for each new electronic prescription, the rea-
sonsfordosechangesanddrugdiscontinuationorders,andthe
natureofanyADEs(Figure1andtheeFigureintheSupplement).
AfteranewprescriptionisenteredthroughtheMOXXIsystem,
the patient may fill the prescription at a pharmacy and may ex-
perience an ADE. At the next visit to a MOXXI physician, if the
prescriptionisnotrenewed,thereasonfordiscontinuationmust
be documented within the MOXXI system. In this way, the rea-
sons for all discontinuations of drug use are recorded. The rea-
sons for discontinuation are grouped into the following 5 do-
mains: safety (eg, adverse drug reaction, allergic response, or
drug interaction), effectiveness (eg, ineffective treatment, no
longer necessary), prescribing or dispensing errors, factors as-
sociated with adherence to the medication regimen (eg, sim-
plifying treatment, substitution of a less expensive drug), and
factors such as patient request and discontinuations by other
physicians. The ADEs are documented using a prepopulated,
drug-specific ADE list that is mapped to the Medical Diction-
aryforRegulatoryActivities(MedDRA)classification.Physicians
can also search from the global list of ADEs or can use free text
toenteraspecificADEdescription.Tosupportclinicaldecision
making, treatment indications automatically populate the
patient’
slistofmedicalproblems.Priorfailedtreatmentandrea-
sonsfordiscontinuationsofdrugtreatment(eg,ADE,hypoten-
sion) are listed under each indication.
Design and Study Population
To evaluate the association between off-label use and ADEs,
a prospective cohort of 46 021 adult patients (aged ≥18 years)
with an incident prescription for a drug was assembled from
January 1, 2005, through December 30, 2009. A drug prescrip-
tionwasconsideredincidentifthesamedrughadnotbeenpre-
scribed or dispensed in the past 12 months. Prescriptions were
followed up from the date of the prescription to the date the
drug use was discontinued, the end of treatment, or the end
of follow-up (December 30, 2010). The MOXXI research pro-
gram was approved by the institutional review board of
McGill University. Patients and physicians provided written
informed consent to be part of the research program.
Adverse Drug Events
Adverse drug events were defined as discontinuations of drug
use made by physicians owing to an adverse drug reaction or
anallergicreaction.Priorevaluationofthevalidityofthesedata
found an 85.7% concordance between the electronic docu-
mentation of ADEs with the medical record.13 The ADEs were
categorized using MedDRA, which includes system organ
classes and preferred terms. The system organ classes repre-
sent the highest hierarchy that provides the broadest concept
for data retrieval and analysis, and preferred terms provide a
distinct descriptor of sign, symptom, diagnosis, or surgical or
medical procedure.
Risk for ADEs and Off-label Use
The indication recorded for each prescription was classified
ason-labeloroff-labeluseaccordingtotheHealthCanadadrug
approval database.18 Compared with the medical record, the
sensitivity (completeness) and the positive predictive value
(correctness) of the documentation of electronic treatment in-
dication in the MOXXI system were 98.5% and 97.0%,
respectively.12IndicationswereconsideredapprovedbyHealth
Canada (or on-label) if they could be matched to the therapeu-
tic indication reported in the drug’
s package insert as of De-
cember 2010. Any indication that could not be matched to the
labeled indication was considered off-label. For each off-
label drug indication, the level of evidence supporting the
drug’
s overall efficacy was categorized using the DrugPoints
System (Thomson Reuters). Strong evidence exists when
(1) the drug is effective or favors efficacy for the off-label treat-
ment indication, (2) the drug is recommended for at least most
patients with the off-label treatment indication, and (3) the

studies used to evaluate efficacy and the strength of evi-
dence include at least 1 randomized controlled trial.2,19 Ac-
cordingly, we created the following 2 variables: (1) on- or off-
labeluseand(2)off-labelusewithandwithoutstrongscientific
evidence. In eTable 1 in the Supplement, we tabulated se-
lected drugs and off-label indications with and without strong
scientific evidence.
We measured drug class as a potential risk factor for ADEs
because the central nervous system (CNS), cardiovascular, and
anti-infective classes were more often implicated in ADEs.20,21
Drug age, defined as the year the drug was approved for mar-
keting, was included because ADEs were more likely to be re-
ported with recently approved drugs than older drugs.22 Drug
age was categorized into the following 3 groups: before 1981;
1981 through 1995; and after 1995 (recent approval).
For patient characteristics, we included age and mea-
suresofcomorbidity(Charlsoncomorbidityindex;range,0-25;
1 or greater indicates increased risk for death)23 because older
patients6,21andthosewithmorethan1comorbidity24mayhave
a higher risk for ADEs. Patient sex was included because higher
rates of ADEs were reported for women than men.25,26 The
number of drugs the patient was taking was included be-
cause it was shown to be the most important risk factor for
ADEs.20,27,28 The continuity of care (COC) index was in-
cluded to correct for possible surveillance bias in the oppor-
tunity to detect ADEs because patients with better continuity
have fewer emergent visits,29 possibly because ADEs and dis-
ease exacerbations are more likely to be detected and averted.
The COC index was defined as the ratio of the number of a pa-
tient’
s visits to the primary care physician to the square root
of the patient’
s total outpatient visits and calculated using the
medical services claims.30

ing to ADEs were calculated by dividing the number of inci-
dent cases by the number of person-months of follow-up, both
overallandbyexposureclassification.Person-monthswerecal-
culated per drug-patient pair starting from the first day of pre-
scription to the discontinuation of drug use, the end of treat-
ment, or the end of the study (December 30, 2010). The hazard
ratio (HR) was calculated with the drug as the unit of analy-
sis, and drugs were nested within patients. In univariate and
multivariate analyses, we fit a marginal Cox proportional haz-
ards regression model using a robust sandwich covariance es-
timator to construct 95% CIs that accounted for intracluster
dependence.31 The 2 off-label variable indicators were in-
cluded in the Cox proportional hazards regression model sepa-
rately. Proportionality assumptions were tested by examin-
ing covariate-time interaction terms and Schoenfeld and
Martingale residuals.32
Results
A total of 46 021 patients received 151 305 incident prescrip-
tions from January 1, 2005, through December 30, 2009. Off-
label use was reported in 17 847 prescriptions (11.8%); in 14 431
of these cases (80.9%), the off-label uses lacked strong scien-
tific evidence (Table 1). Mean (SD) patient age was 58.2 (16.8)
years. Patients were predominantly women (27 982 [60.8%]);
11 383 patients (24.7%) had a Charlson comorbidity index of 1
or greater, and 19 342 (42.0%) used more than 4 unique drugs
during the study period. Of the 630 prescribed drugs, 292
(46.3%)hadbeenapprovedformarketbefore1981,whereas180
(28.6%)wereapprovedafter1995.Themean(SD)COCindexwas
1.09 (0.64). The follow-up time for a prescription ranged from
1 day to almost 6 years (median, 386 days; mean, 530 days).
The distribution of off-label use (with and without strong
scientific evidence) by American Hospital Formulary Service
drug class is shown in eTable 2 in the Supplement. For the
38 370 CNS drugs found, off-label use and off-label use with-
out scientific evidence were reported in 9814 of 38 370 pre-
scribed drugs (25.6%) and 8157 prescribed drugs (21.3%), re-
spectively. Among the CNS drugs, off-label use was highest for
anticonvulsants (2158 [65.6%]), antipsychotics (669 [51.4%]),
andantidepressants(3657[33.5%]);off-labelusewithoutstrong
scientificevidenceforthesedrugswasreportedin2116(64.3%),
668 (51.3%), and 3063 (28.1%), respectively.
Physicians discontinued 3484 drug treatments owing to
ADEs. Most ADEs (2456 [70.5%]) occurred in the first year of
treatment and, among these, 1228 (50%) occurred in the first
3 months. eTable 3 in the Supplement shows selected drugs
with high levels of off-label use and the proportion of drugs
with discontinuation of use owing to ADEs. The overall inci-
dence rate of ADEs for all drugs was 13.2 per 10 000 person-
months. The ADE rate for on-label use was lower (12.5 per
10 000 person-months) than for off-label use (19.7 per 10 000
person-months), a 44% increase in the risk for ADEs with off-
label use (adjusted HR [AHR], 1.44; 95% CI, 1.30-1.60) (Table 2
and Figure 2). When off-label use was stratified to off-label use
withandwithoutstrongscientificevidence,theADErateswere
13.2 and 21.7 per 10 000 person-months, respectively. Com-

Anti-infectives had the highest ADE rate (66.2 per 10 000
person-months), more than a 6-fold increase in risk for ADEs
compared with gastrointestinal tract drugs (AHR, 6.33; 95% CI,
4.58, 8.76). Central nervous system and cardiovascular drugs
had ADE rates of 18.1 and 15.9 per 10 000 person-months, re-
spectively. Drugs approved after 1995 had ADE rates that were
55% higher than drugs approved before 1981 (AHR, 1.55; 95%

We found that off-label use of drugs was associated with ADEs
after adjusting for important patient and drug characteristics.
Moreover,wenotedariskgradientwithhigherratesofADEsfor
off-label uses lacking strong scientific evidence.
Although the intrinsic nature of the drug to cause ADEs is
the same for on-label and off-label uses, it may be modified
by a number of factors, including the off-label disease condi-
tion. In addition, the lack of approval from a regulatory body
implies a lack of safe dose ranges and inadequate informa-
tiononcontraindications,whichinaggregatemakeADEsmore
likely. We found that 4 in 5 off-label prescriptions lacked strong
scientific evidence, and this group had higher rates of ADEs.
Off-label use may be clinically appropriate given the complex-
ity of the patient’
s condition, the lack of alternative effective
drugs, or after exhausting approved drugs. However, a lack of
physician knowledge of approved treatment indications33 was
shown to be 1 factor for off-label prescribing. Physicians are
finding it difficult to keep up with rapidly changing medica-
tion information, and this lack of knowledge is affecting treat-
ment of patients.34 Studies20,27,28,35 have shown that the num-
ber of drugs used by a patient strongly influences the risk for
ADEsowingtoanincreasedriskforinappropriateprescribing,36
drug-drug interaction,37 and drug-disease interaction.38 Simi-
larly to other studies,20,21,39 we found the rates of ADEs were
significantly higher among patients using drugs from the anti-
infective, cardiovascular, and CNS drug classes. We also found
the same age effect that was reported from the French phar-
macovigilance study,40 with the oldest group having a higher
crude incidence rate of ADEs; however, after adjusting for the
number of drug treatments, the effect disappears. Overall, this
finding shows that the number of prescribed drugs is the stron-
gestriskfactorforADEs.20,41Inourstudy,ahigherriskforADEs
was observed for women, even after accounting for the COC
index to mitigate the effect of high consultation rates among
women. We also identified patients with a higher COC index
as having a high risk for ADEs, possibly owing to surveillance
detection biases with more opportunity to identify ADEs in
their earlier stages.
Using appropriately configured computerized decision
support systems, we could fill the knowledge gap in off-label
prescribing by supplying clinicians with information on drug
approval status and the degree of scientific evidence at the
point of care. In addition, the inclusion of treatment indica-
tion in the electronic prescription would facilitate communi-
cation among physicians, pharmacists, and patients and may
decrease medication errors42 (eg, wrong-patient errors and
look-alikeandsound-alikedrugs).Atthesametime,thesetech-
nologies could allow physicians to participate actively in the
systematic collection of data to evaluate the benefits and risks
associated with the off-label use of drugs. Moreover, moni-
toring patients in the community with a nurse or an interac-
tive voice response system to detect drug-related problems43
and relaying this information to a community pharmacist or
the treating physician would be one option of detecting and
ameliorating these risks.
The study has several limitations. First, ADE identifica-
tiondependsonphysiciansandpatients.Physiciansareknown
to miss medication-related symptoms, and patients may not
inform their physicians about all of their symptoms.44 Sec-
ond, ADEs among patients with comorbidities may not be as
easily attributed to the drug (vs the concurrent disease) and
may not be identified. Third, patients with severe ADEs may
visit hospitals and other physicians, and the ADEs might not
be recorded in their EHR. All these limitations might have re-
sulted in an underestimation of ADE incidence. However, the
underestimationofADErateswilllikelyaffecton-labelandoff-
label uses equivalently and thus not bias the association be-
tween drug approval status and ADEs.33 Although the ADEs
were severe enough to warrant discontinuation of drug use,
the ADEs were not documented with a severity scale, which
limited subgroup analysis.
Whenclassifyingoff-labeluse,weonlyconsideredthedrug
andthetreatmentindication.Ouroff-labeldefinitiondidnotcon-
sider the dosage, frequency, route of administration, duration
of treatment, and patients’age range. A wider definition of off-
label use could have increased the prevalence of off-label use.
In recent years, drug regulatory bodies have created
mechanisms to expedite the drug review process and to give
the public rapid access to drugs. In addition, they have man-
dated the life-cycle approach to drug evaluation with ongo-
ing pharmacovigilance and risk evaluation and mitigation
strategies. For example, France has passed a law to monitor
off-label drug use and study the benefit-risk ratios of these
uses in collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry.15 In
this study, we demonstrated that an EHR system tailored to
document treatment indications and the reason for treat-
ment discontinuation can be used to monitor off-label drug
use and its outcomes. Such a system can help to tackle fun-
damental problems in postmarketing surveillance of drugs,
namely, the lack of an explicit link between prescribed drugs
and their indication for use and the underreporting of ADEs.
Large-scale documentation of drug indications, ADEs, and
clinical variables within the EHR can facilitate powerful
observational studies, comparative safety and effectiveness
trials, and decision support systems. Moreover, linking a
prescribed drug with an indication and outcome (eg, ADE)
could be a meaningful-use objective, thereby advancing
meaningful use to meaningful benefit.45

In our study, the cost of ADEs was not measured. How-
ever, the cost can be estimated using previously published
figures. Adverse effects that occur in nonhospital settings
may lead to emergency department visits and hospital
admissions. The mean cost of an emergency department
visit without hospital admission has been estimated to
range from $549 to $704 per ADE, whereas the estimated
mean cost of treating an ADE resulting in hospital admission
has been estimated to range from $5118 to $11 789 (in 2014
US currency).46 The median prevalence rate of hospitaliza-
tions resulting from ADEs has been estimated at 4.6%.47
The present study found 3484 ADEs in 46 021 patients;
thus, the mean cost per ADE would range from $759 to
$1214. Likewise, the mean cost per study patient would be
$51 to $77.
Conclusions
Off-label drug use, and particularly off-label use without
strong scientific evidence, is a risk factor for ADEs. Hence,
physicians and physician organizations should recognize

Off-label Drug Use and Adverse Drug Events
Turning up the Heat on Off-label Prescribing

Yelling“Fire!”inacrowdedtheaterwithoutanyimminentdan-
ger is an oft-cited example of free speech that is not protected.
Formanyyears,theUSFoodandDrugAdministration(FDA)has
prohibited the promotion of
unapproved uses of drugs.
This restriction has recently
been challenged under the
guise of free speech. In a potential landmark decision in Au-
gust 2015, a federal judge ruled against the FDA’
s restrictions
onoff-labeldrugpromotion,referencingprotectionbytheFirst
Amendment.1 Critics of off-label drug promotion point to di-
etary supplements as an example of the kinds of claims that are
commonplace when regulation is lax and worry about an ero-
sion of the authority of the FDA to ensure safety and efficacy
ofdrugs.2Aretheseconcernsaboutsafetywarranted?Doesevi-
denceshowthatoff-labelprescribingmightbelesssafethanon-
label prescribing? In light of these concerns, the study of off-
labeldruguseandadversedrugeventsbyEgualeandcolleagues3
in this issue of JAMA Internal Medicine is particularly timely.
The FDA has substantial responsibility and authority in the
preapproval process of new drugs to ensure safety, efficacy,
and accuracy in the approved label. The postapproval period
is far less regulated. Although the FDA is clearly interested in
postapproval drug safety and occasionally provides approval
contingent on performance of additional studies, once a drug
reaches the market, literally millions of patients may be ex-
posed to that drug with limited ability to track its safety or ef-
fectiveness. Physicians are not legally required to follow the
approvedlabeledindications,andtheFDAevenrecognizesthat
off-label use of drugs may constitute good medical practice in
some cases.4
Of course, many examples of appropriate off-label uses of
medications exist, and in some situations, off-label use of a
drug may be the standard of care. Digoxin is approved for rate
control in atrial fibrillation, whereas use of metoprolol is off-
label.However,metoprolol,butnotdigoxin,isfirst-linetherapy
for rate control in evidence-based clinical guidelines. More-
over, off-label use may precede approval for an indication.
Thalidomide was approved to treat leprosy in 1998. In 1999,
it was reported to be effective for multiple myeloma5; by 2003,
the manufacturer of thalidomide reported that 92% of its
sales came from the off-label use.6 Eventually in 2006, the
multiple myeloma indication was added to the label.
Because physicians are not required to document in-
tended indications, tracking off-label drug use is challenging.
Byallaccounts,off-labelprescribingiscommon.Amongoffice-
based physicians in 2001, an estimated 21% of overall pre-
scriptions were off-label.7 Off-label use of cardiac medica-
tions and anticonvulsants was especially common, and the
investigators reported that almost three-quarters of all off-
label use had little or no scientific evidence to support the
indication.7 Perhaps contributing to off-label use of drugs is a
general lack of physician knowledge of FDA indications, with
the frequent assumption of FDA approval for off-label indica-
tions with uncertain or absent evidence of benefit.8
Although evidence of overall safety of off-label prescrib-
ing is limited, many individual reports of patient harm exist. A
Knight Ridder investigational news series in 2003 alleged that
off-label prescribing was routine and resulted in death or seri-
ous injuries to many patients.9 The report documented ex-

tipsychotics to treat behavioral issues in elderly patients with
dementia, anticonvulsants to treat bipolar disorder, terbuta-
