Abstract 
Progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) is a severely disabling neurological condition, and an 
effective treatment is urgently needed. Recently, high-dose biotin has emerged as a 
promising therapy for affected individuals. Initial clinical data have shown that daily doses of 
biotin of up to 300 mg can improve objective measures of MS-related disability. In this 
article, we review the biology of biotin and explore the properties of this ubiquitous 
coenzyme that may explain the encouraging responses seen in patients with progressive 
MS. The gradual worsening of neurological disability in patients with progressive MS is 
caused by progressive axonal loss or damage. The triggers for axonal loss in MS likely 
include both inflammatory demyelination of the myelin sheath and primary 
neurodegeneration caused by a state of virtual hypoxia within the neuron. Accordingly, 
targeting both these pathological processes could be effective in the treatment of 
progressive MS. Biotin is an essential co-factor for five carboxylases involved in fatty acid 
synthesis and energy production. We hypothesize that high-dose biotin is exerting a 
therapeutic effect in patients with progressive MS through two different and complementary 
mechanisms: by promoting axonal remyelination by enhancing myelin production and by 
reducing axonal hypoxia through enhanced energy production.

1. Introduction 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) affects an estimated 2.3 million people worldwide (Browne et al., 
2014). MS is the most common disabling neurological disease of young adults, with first 
symptoms typically manifesting between 20 and 40 years of age (Browne et al., 2014). The 
condition is more common in women than men, and prevalence generally increases with 
latitude (Simpson S Jr et al., 2011). In Europe, the highest prevalence of MS is seen in 
Nordic countries and the British Isles (Kingwell et al., 2013). A diagnosis of MS places a high 
burden on the affected individual, both economically and with respect to MS-associated 
disability (Pike et al., 2012). 
In the majority (85%) of cases, patients experience an initial phase of relapsing-remitting 
neurological dysfunction (RRMS), which typically evolves into a secondary progressive 
disease at a later point in the clinical course (SPMS) (Confavreux et al., 2000). Once MS is 
in the progressive phase, individuals experience a gradual worsening of neurological 
disability leading to problems with vision, walking, balance, incontinence, cognitive changes, 
fatigue, and pain (Gibson and Frank, 2002). Primary progressive MS (PPMS), characterized 
by disease progression from onset, is less common, affecting 10–15% of patients 
(Confavreux et al., 2000; Koch et al., 2009). Despite these different initial clinical 
phenotypes, the time to reach certain disability milestones and the ages at which the 
milestones are reached are similar for all patients with progressive MS (Confavreux and 
Vukusic, 2006).  
Treatment options for MS remain inadequate. Most currently approved therapies for MS 
target inflammatory processes and aim to reduce the frequency of exacerbations in patients 
with RRMS. These include β-interferons, dimethyl fumarate, glatiramer acetate, fingolimod, 
teriflunomide, and natalizumab (Wingerchuk and Carter, 2014). β-interferon (Trojano et al., 
2007), teriflunomide (Confavreux et al., 2014), fingolimod (Kappos et al., 2010), 
alemtuzumab (Coles et al., 2012), natalizumab (Polman et al., 2006), and mitoxantrone

(Martinelli et al., 2013) may also delay or reduce the risk of disability progression. However, 
currently available treatments have little to no efficacy in patients with progressive MS, 
particularly if superimposed relapses are absent, and there is no pharmacological therapy 
capable of arresting or reversing MS-related disability (Comi, 2013). Encouraging results 
have recently been reported with the use of nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation in patients with RRMS (Burt et al., 2015). This technique achieved a striking 
improvement in disability (as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale; EDSS) in 
approximately half of the patients at 2-year follow-up; moreover, 80% of patients remained 
relapse free at 4-year follow-up. However, no benefit was seen in patients who had 
progressive MS at the time of transplant. For these individuals, an effective treatment 
remains a significant unmet medical need. 
Two promyelinogenic agents are currently in development as treatment for MS. LINGO1 
(leucine-rich repeat and immunoglobulin-like domain-containing nogo receptor-interacting 
protein 1) inhibits the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and 
consequently inhibits myelination (Jepson et al., 2012). Upregulation of this receptor is seen 
in many neurological disorders, including in OPCs found within areas of demyelination from 
patients with MS (Mi et al., 2013). Inhibition of LINGO1 in animal models of autoimmune 
encephalomyelitis results in the formation of new myelin sheaths (Mi et al., 2007). Phase I 
data from healthy volunteers and patients with MS indicate that inhibition of LINGO1 with the 
monoclonal antibody BIIB033 (Biogen Idec) appears to be well tolerated and a phase II trial 
in patients with RRMS is ongoing (EUDRACT #: 2011-006262-40). First results have been 
presented at the American Academy of Neurology. In the per-protocol population, the anti-
LINGO-1 group showed significantly improved optic nerve conduction latency vs placebo at 
Week 32. No statistical difference was observed in the ITT population or for the secondary 
endpoints including visual acuity at low contrast (Cadavid et al., 2015). In addition, a 
recombinant form of a human IgM (rHIgM22; Acorda Therapeutics) that binds to myelin and 
the surface of oligodendrocytes has been shown to promote remyelination in murine models

of MS and other demyelinating diseases (Mitsunaga et al., 2002; Warrington et al., 2007). 
The safety and preliminary efficacy of rHIgM22 are currently being investigated in patients 
with all forms of MS in a phase I trial (NCT01803867). 
In this paper, we review recently published data that suggest that high-dose biotin is an 
effective treatment for patients with progressive MS and propose two distinct (and 
complementary) mechanisms of action to explain this efficacy. 
2. Etiology and pathogenesis of MS 
Despite decades of research into the biology of MS, the etiology of this progressive 
neurological disease remains incompletely understood. Multiple sclerosis is classically 
considered to be an autoimmune demyelination disorder in which activated T-cells migrate 
across the blood brain barrier and attack the insulating myelin sheath that surrounds the 
axons (Compston and Coles, 2008). This leads to a progressive demyelination of the axons 
that ultimately culminates in degeneration of the denuded neurons. Indeed, there is 
abundant evidence supporting the inflammatory component of MS. Acute inflammatory 
lesions are characterized by the presence of infiltrating activated T-cells (both CD4+ and 
CD8+) (Denic et al., 2013; Traugott et al., 1983), and the frequency of axonal damage is 
related to the degree of inflammation within lesions (Trapp et al., 1998). Inflammation is 
initially transient and remyelination of axons occurs (Olsen and Akirav, 2015), which may 
explain the relapsing-remitting nature of the signs and symptoms of RRMS. If demyelination 
persists, denuded axons are vulnerable to damage and these immune-mediated attacks lead 
to axonal injury and neuronal death (Brugarolas and Popko, 2014; Podbielska et al., 2013). 
However, autoimmunity alone fails to fully explain the pathophysiology of MS. In particular, 
axonal degradation can occur in normal-appearing white matter that has no evidence of 
myelin loss (Bjartmar et al., 2001; Lovas et al., 2000) or inflammation (Bitsch et al., 2000; 
Dutta and Trapp, 2011), and axonal degradation can occur at all stages of MS disease 
progression (De Stefano N. et al., 2001; Levin et al., 2014; Trapp et al., 1998). An alternative

theory proposes that MS is primarily a neurodegenerative disorder in which the inflammatory 
responses observed in patients with MS arise in response to highly antigenic components 
that are released during degradation of the neurons (Bruck, 2005; Stys et al., 2012; Trapp 
and Nave, 2008). Regardless of whether neurodegeneration occurs secondary to 
demyelination or whether primary neurodegeneration is the trigger for inflammatory 
demyelination, axonal loss or damage is undeniably the cause for the progressive 
neurological disability seen in MS (Bjartmar et al., 2000; Bjartmar et al., 2003; De Stefano N. 
et al., 1998; Dutta and Trapp, 2007). The exact mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration 
remain poorly understood but are believed to include a combination of energy imbalance, 
CD8+ cells, glutamate, nitric oxide, and loss of trophic interaction with oligodendrocytes 
(Bitsch et al., 2000; Bjartmar et al., 2003; Bruck, 2005).  
3. High-dose biotin as a treatment for MS 
MD1003 (MedDay Pharmaceuticals, Paris, France) is an oral formulation of high-dose 
pharmaceutical-grade biotin currently in clinical development as a treatment for progressive 
MS and adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN). The daily dose of MD1003 currently being 
investigated in phase III trials (300 mg biotin) is 10,000-fold higher than the Adequate Intake 
(AI) – the daily dietary intake level of biotin that is considered sufficient for the maintenance 
of health by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine is 30 µg/day for adults 
(IOM Standing Committee on the Scientific Evaluation of Dietary Reference Intervals, 1998). 
At 300 mg per day, biotin is considered by regulators to be an active pharmaceutical agent. 
Therefore, the efficacy and safety of high-dose biotin as a therapeutic option in MS require 
careful investigation prior to being made available for clinical use. 
Clinical data from the first patients treated with MD1003 have recently been published (Sedel 
et al., 2015). This open-label pilot trial investigated daily administration of high-dose biotin 
(100–300 mg/day) in 23 patients with primary or secondary progressive MS who received 
MD1003 for a mean duration of 9.2 months (range 2–36 months). Over 90% of the patients

(21/23) exhibited some degree of qualitative or quantitative clinical improvement following 
MD1003 therapy including reduced MS-related disability. A beneficial effect was seen in all 
forms of progressive MS. Improvements in walking distance, EDSS values, and time to walk 
25 feet (TW25) were observed in patients with prominent spinal cord involvement, and 
improvements in visual acuity and the progressive reappearance of visual evoked potentials 
with normal latencies were recorded in patients with visual impairment related to optic nerve 
injury (Sedel et al., 2015). The promising efficacy observed in this pilot study suggests that 
high-dose biotin is effective in both reversing disease progression and reducing chronic 
disability. The study has important methodological limitations including the small number of 
patients, the small number of centers, the lack of a placebo or control group, the 
heterogeneity of patients enrolled, the heterogeneity of evaluation criteria, and the fact that 
treating and assessing physicians were the same. Results of a double-blind, placebo-
controlled, multisite study were presented in April at the American Academy of Neurology 
(Tourbah et al., 2015a). 154 patients were randomized, (103 received 300 mg of biotin per 
day and 51 received a placebo). Patients had secondary or primary progressive MS with 
EDSS between 4.5 and 7 and evidence of EDSS progression within the past two years. 
Treatment duration was 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who 
improved at month 9 and confirmed at month 12, defined as decreased EDSS (by at least 1 
point for EDSS ≤5.5 and 0.5 point for EDSS ≥6) or improved TW25 of at least 20%. A 
significant proportion of biotin-treated patients achieved the primary endpoint versus none of 
51 placebo-treated patients (p=0.0051). The primary endpoint was confirmed by a significant 
decrease in the mean change in EDSS and the Clinical Global Impression Scale assessed 
by the investigator and subject in the biotin group (Tourbah et al., 2015b). We are hopeful 
that these results ultimately represent a major breakthrough in the treatment of MS because 
no therapeutic options have yet been validated to treat the progressive (primary or 
secondary) forms of the disease and its sequelae-related symptoms. In each patient treated 
with MD1003, there was a delay between the onset of treatment and the onset of objective 
clinical improvement; delays ranged from 2 to 8 months. This tantalizing observation

suggests that MD1003 is triggering some form of slowly progressive repair and furthermore 
may act as a disease-modifying therapy in patients with progressive disease. Both the 
compassionate use open-label study and the placebo-controlled trial after 12 months’ follow-
up are however of insufficient duration to answer this question. Data from the 12-month 
extension phase of this trial (during which all participants receive high-dose biotin) are 
expected in January 2016 and will be important in assessing the impact of the drug on long-
term disability progression. 
4. The role of biotin in brain chemistry 
Biotin (vitamin H) is a ubiquitous B-complex vitamin that acts as an essential coenzyme for 
five essential carboxylases: pyruvate carboxylase (PC) 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase 
(MCC), propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC), and the two isoforms of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 
(ACC1 and ACC2) (Tong, 2013; Zempleni et al., 2009). Biotin is covalently bound to specific 
lysine residues on apocarboxylases; the biotinylation reaction is catalyzed by 
holocarboxylase synthetase (HLCS), an ATP-dependent enzyme encoded by the HLCS 
gene (Chapman-Smith and Cronan, Jr., 1999). Once bound, biotin acts as a transporter of 
an activated carboxyl moiety in a variety of carboxylation reactions involved in energy 
metabolism, fatty acid synthesis, and amino acid catabolism (Tong, 2013). The central role 
of biotin in intermediary metabolism is likely responsible for the observation that biotin is 
required by all tissues of the body; however, biotin appears to play a particularly important 
role in brain chemistry. In contrast to liver, kidney, and brain, biotin is present in relatively 
small amounts in many tissues (a fact on which many (strept-)avidin-biotin histochemical 
techniques rely); however, studies in the rat have demonstrated that significant levels of 
covalently bound biotin are found in the brain, particularly in the cerebellar motor system and 
the brainstem auditory system (McKay et al., 2004). Biotin is actively transported across the 
human blood-brain barrier (BBB) predominantly via the Na+-dependent multivitamin 
transporter (SLC5A6/SMVT; (Uchida et al., 2015)). This transporter has an estimated half-
saturation concentration (Km) of roughly 100 µM in rats (Spector and Mock, 1987), 35 µM in

mice (Park and Sinko, 2005) and 20 µM in rabbits (Spector and Mock, 1988a). By 
extrapolation of data obtained with smaller doses (Mock and Mock, 1997; Zempleni et al., 
2001), assuming dose proportionality, high doses of biotin in the 300 mg/day range would 
result in plasma concentrations of biotin of about 5 µM, which theoretically would not be 
saturating the biotin transporter (Spector and Johanson, 2007). Consistent with these data, 
biotin concentration was shown to increase from about 0.1 to 6 nmol/g of brain tissue in 
juvenile rats given increasing oral doses of biotin corresponding to about 0.3 µg to 3 mg/kg 
body weight in humans, the highest dose being closest to the human therapeutic dose given 
in progressive MS (Sawamura et al., 2007). Biotin concentration also increased in other 
tissues evaluated, namely skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, lung, spleen and testis. Within 
animal brain, limited data indicate that biotin is localized to the oligodendrocytes (LeVine and 
Macklin, 1988; Wang and Pevsner, 1999) and in some neurons (McKay et al., 2004). 
Interestingly, levels of covalently bound biotin and the expression of HCLS, biotin-dependent 
carboxylases, and genes involved in biotin transport and biotin recycling are maintained in 
the brain during periods of biotin deficiency at the expense of other tissues such as liver 
(Chiang and Mistry, 1974; Pacheco-Alvarez et al., 2004; Rodriguez-Melendez et al., 2001; 
Sander et al., 1982).  
Further evidence for the vital role of biotin in neuron function comes from the observation 
that neurological dysfunction is prominent in patients with biotin deficiency and inborn errors 
of biotin metabolism (Wolf, 2011; Wolf and Feldman, 1982). Biotin has a vital role in the 
treatment of the orphan neurological disease biotin-thiamine responsive basal ganglia 
disease (BTBGD). This autosomal recessive disorder is caused by inherited mutations in the 
gene encoding a transmembrane thiamine transporter that was originally termed solute 
carrier family 19 member 3 [SLC19A3] but now more commonly known as thiamine 
transporter 2 (THTR2) (Said et al., 2004; Zeng et al., 2005). The symptoms of BTBGD are 
severe and are characterized by recurrent subacute onset of encephalopathy that manifest 
as confusion, seizures, dysarthria, ataxia, dystonia, supranuclear facial palsy and even coma

(Ozand et al., 1998; Tabarki et al., 2013). Despite the fact that THTR2 is not a biotin 
transporter in studies in hepatic, intestinal, or neuronal cell lines (Subramanian et al., 2006), 
the condition is effectively and rapidly treated with high-dose biotin (5–10 mg/kg/day) (Bindu 
et al., 2009; Ozand et al., 1998).  
5. Hypothesized modes of action of high-dose biotin in the treatment of 
progressive MS  
We hypothesize that high-dose biotin exerts its therapeutic effect in progressive MS through 
two primary mechanisms: 1) promotion of remyelination through enhanced myelin formation 
in oligodendrocytes, and 2) enhancement of brain energy production, thereby protecting 
demyelinated axons from degradation. 
5.1 High-dose biotin as a promoter of myelination through enhanced myelin formation in 
oligodendrocytes 
Through its role as an essential cofactor for ACC1 and ACC2, high-dose biotin may be 
promoting remyelination by increasing the availability of the fundamental building blocks 
required for myelin membrane synthesis. ACC1 and ACC2 are encoded by two distinct 
genes (ACACA and ACACB) and have distinct subcellular locations and distinct metabolic 
roles. ACC1 catalyzes the rate limiting, committed step in fatty acid biosynthesis: the 
cytosolic synthesis of malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA (Figure 1) (Foster, 2012; Tong, 2013). 
A role for ACC in promoting myelination is supported by several observations. Within the 
CNS, ACC appears to be primarily expressed in oligodendrocytes, the cells specialized in 
myelin synthesis (Chakraborty and Ledeen, 2003; Tansey and Cammer, 1988); not 
surprisingly, a significant proportion of cytosolic ACC is detectable in purified myelin 
(Chakraborty and Ledeen, 2003) and the activity of ACC in oligodendrocytes in rats is 
highest during the neonatal myelinating period (DeWille and Horrocks, 1992; Tansey et al., 
1988). The relative contribution of ACC1 and ACC2 to ACC activity in the brain is not known. 
However, in human adult brain (RNA pooled from multiple donors), ACC1 RNA was found to

be approximately twice as abundant as ACC2 RNA (Castle et al., 2009). Furthermore, levels 
of murine ACC are significantly reduced in the sciatic nerve of the trembler mouse model of 
peripheral nervous system dysmyelination compared with normal mice (Salles et al., 2003). 
Finally, malonyl-CoA, the product of the reaction catalyzed by ACC, is used as the two-
carbon building block for fatty acid synthesis by the brain microsomal fatty acid elongating 
system for deposition in myelin (DeWille and Horrocks, 1992). Malonyl-CoA also coordinates 
the balance between fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid oxidation. As cytosolic levels of 
malonyl-CoA increase, the rate of fatty acid synthesis increases; as peri-mitochondrial levels 
of malonyl-CoA from the reaction catalyzed by ACC2 increase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 
1 (CPT1) is inhibited and the rate of fatty acid transport into mitochondria decreases leading 
to reduced fatty acid beta oxidation (Foster, 2012; McGarry et al., 1978). Therefore, high-
dose biotin may be acting as a promyelinogenic agent through its role as a cofactor for 
ACC1 and ACC2.  
The normalization of visual evoked potential latency observed in one MS patient with chronic 
visual loss after 9 months’ treatment with MD1003 is consistent with myelin repair (Sedel et 
al., 2015). A progressive decrease in the choline/creatine ratio was observed with magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy in a second patient with prominent optic nerve involvement; the 
ratio normalized completely after 9 months of treatment with MD1003. Elevations of choline, 
the core component of the hydrophilic head of membrane phospholipids, are commonly 
observed in MS plaques and are thought to result from the breakdown of the phospholipid 
membrane that occurs during inflammation, gliosis, and demyelination (Arnold et al., 1992; 
Narayana, 2005). We speculate that normalization of the choline/creatine ratio overtime after 
treatment with MD1003 reflects progressive myelin repair accompanied by a decrease in 
free choline release from membranes. In addition, the delay in onset of clinical benefit (2–8 
months) seen in MS patients treated with MD1003 is consistent with remodeling of the 
myelin sheath. Remodeling of the myelin sheath is believed to occur at a relatively slow rate.

MRI studies in patients with acute gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesions suggest that the 
process of remyelination takes an average of 7 months (Chen et al., 2008).  
Remyelination of denuded axons is a logical and attractive strategy for the treatment of 
progressive MS (Franklin and Ffrench-Constant, 2008; Zawadzka and Franklin, 2007). 
Extensive regenerative remyelination occurs in some patients with early MS but is typically 
reduced as the disease progresses (Goldschmidt et al., 2009; Miron et al., 2011; Prineas et 
al., 1993). Remyelination has been documented in both active and inactive MS lesions 
(Miron et al., 2011), and remyelination strategies stimulate functional recovery in animal 
models of MS (Bai et al., 2012; Deshmukh et al., 2013; Duncan et al., 2009). The process 
underlying remyelination is complex and is thought to involve the maturation and migration of 
OPCs and numerous promoting and inhibitory factors (Munzel and Williams, 2013). 
However, by increasing the supply of the two carbon units required for fatty acid elongation 
(the fundamental building block of myelin), high-dose biotin acting through ACC is an 
attractive candidate for a novel promyelinogenic agent.  
5.2 High-dose biotin in the reversal of virtual hypoxia 
As well as promoting remyelination through its role as a cofactor for ACC, high-dose biotin 
may also be targeting cellular energy levels. Several lines of evidence suggest that cellular 
energy deprivation secondary to demyelination is responsible for the progressive irreversible 
neuronal degeneration observed in progressive MS (Luessi et al., 2012; Stys et al., 2012). In 
the normal, myelinated neuron, the nerve impulse is conducted along the length of the axon 
in discreet jumps spreading along the chain of nodes of Ranvier, which contain high 
densities of voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels (Figure 2) (Rasband and Trimmer, 2001). 
This process, termed saltatory conduction, not only increases the speed at which the nerve 
impulse is propagated compared with nerve impulses in unmyelinated axons, but also 
reduces neuronal energy expenditure because ATP is only needed to restore the resting 
membrane potential at the nodes of Ranvier. Restoration of the resting membrane potential

is mainly achieved by the ATP-dependent Na+/K+ pump (Na+/K+ ATPase) (Krishnan et al., 
2009).  
Loss of the insulating myelin sheath causes the loss of saltatory conduction and thereby 
increases the energy required for nerve propagation. In denuded axons, voltage-gated Na+ 
channels are redistributed along the length of the axon (Figure 2). This compensatory 
mechanism reflects a switch from saltatory to continuous conduction (Craner et al., 2004; 
Levin et al., 2014). This switch is accompanied by an increase in the number of mitochondria 
in the demyelinated axons as a result of the neuron’s attempt to supply the increased energy 
demand required to maintain the intracellular/extracellular ion gradients (Witte et al., 2009). 
However, evidence suggests that, in MS patients, axonal ATP production is simultaneously 
compromised due to defects in their neuronal mitochondria (Dutta et al., 2006; Mahad et al., 
2009; Su et al., 2009). The resulting imbalance between energy supply and energy demand 
causes a state of ‘virtual hypoxia’ which may be the trigger for neuron degeneration (Luessi 
et al., 2012; Trapp and Stys, 2009). If insufficient ATP is available for Na+/K+ ATPase to 
restore the membrane potential, the neuron will enter a state of depolarization characterized 
by a further influx of Na+. This state can activate the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger in reverse mode, 
leading to an increase in intra-axonal Ca2+ as Na+ ions are removed from the neuron (Trapp 
and Stys, 2009). Excessive levels of Ca2+ in the neuron can activate a number of Ca2+-
mediated degenerative pathways (Trapp and Stys, 2009). In chronic MS lesions, axonal 
levels of Na+/K+ ATPase are decreased, which may exacerbate the state of membrane 
depolarization (Young et al., 2008). 
We hypothesize that treatment with high-dose biotin reverses this state of virtual hypoxia 
through its role as a cofactor for PC, MCC, and PCC. These three enzymes are central to 
aerobic energy production and generate intermediates for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle 
(Figure 3) (Tong, 2013). All three of these enzymes are known to be expressed in 
astrocytes and neurons (Ballhausen et al., 2009; Hassel, 2000). PC catalyzes the 
conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate, thus serving an essential anaplerotic role by

replenishing the 4-carbon “backbone” of the TCA cycle. PCC generates methylmalonyl-CoA 
from propionyl-CoA, which is then converted to succinyl-CoA by methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. 
MCC plays a role in the metabolism of leucine and ultimately leads to production of acetyl-
CoA. Thus, these three biotin-dependent carboxylases feed the TCA cycle at three different 
entry points (oxaloacetate, succinate, and acetyl-CoA) and could be expected to increase 
the levels of cellular ATP at the rate of one molecule of acetyl-CoA used by the TCA cycle 
producing one molecule of ATP. Indeed, nutritional biotin deficiency and biotin deficiency 
induced by knocking out the recycling enzyme biotinidase cause severe ATP depletion 
(Hernandez-Vazquez et al., 2012; Hernandez-Vazquez et al., 2013; Velazquez-Arellano et 
al., 2011). By increasing the available intraneuronal pool of ATP, high-dose biotin may 
reduce demyelinated neural dysfunction and the adverse effects of hypoxia (Lazzarino et al., 
2010; Trapp and Stys, 2009).  
In progressive MS, the proportion of mutant mitochondria increases through clonal 
expansion of mitochondrial DNA deletions (Campbell et al., 2011). As a consequence, some 
neurons still possess functional mitochondria, while others have damaged mitochondria or a 
mixture of functional and damaged mitochondria (heteroplasmy; (Mahad et al., 2015)). In this 
latter case, the remaining pool of mitochondria with functional respiratory chain enzymes 
may not be sufficient to compensate for the increase in energy demand occurring in 
chronically demyelinated axons. It could be anticipated that only axons with some remaining 
healthy mitochondria would benefit from the treatment with high-dose biotin. 
A similar hypothesis has been the basis for testing idebenone in progressive MS (Spindler et 
al., 2009) (NCT00950248 and NCT01854359). Increasing cellular energy production is also 
thought to be the mechanism by which idebenone (Catena®, Santhera Pharmaceuticals), a 
synthetic analog of coenzyme Q10 exerts its therapeutic activity. This compound is a 
substrate for reduction by two NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductases (NQO1 and NQO2) 
(Haefeli et al., 2011). The reduced form of idebenone is believed to pass electrons into the 
mitochondrial respiratory chain triggering an increase in cellular ATP levels. Of note,

experiments in the chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis EAE mouse model 
failed to demonstrate any effect of idebenone in preventing or attenuating disability (Fiebiger 
et al., 2013).  
Several other mechanisms by which biotin may be exerting a therapeutic effect exist. Biotin 
is a key transcriptional regulator of several genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. 
In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that elevated biotin levels can upregulate the 
expression of hepatic and pancreatic glucokinase, insulin, and the insulin receptor, and 
downregulate hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Chauhan and Dakshinamurti, 
1991; Dokusova and Krivoruchenko, 1972; Leon-Del-Rio, 2005; Marshall et al., 1980; 
Pacheco-Alvarez et al., 2002; Romero-Navarro et al., 1999). Interestingly, biotin also 
regulates the expression of two of the carboxylases for which it acts as a cofactor (PC and 
ACC1), and of HCLS (Pacheco-Alvarez et al., 2004). The mechanism by which biotin 
regulates gene expression remains elusive. Biotin was initially thought not to be a natural 
modifier of histones (Healy et al., 2009), However, biotinylation sites are known to be 
present on histones H2A, H3, and H4 (Zempleni et al., 2012b) and several studies have 
demonstrated that biotinylation of histones by HCLS induces chromatin remodeling that can 
regulate gene expression (Filenko et al., 2011; Gralla et al., 2008; Kuroishi et al., 2011; 
Wijeratne et al., 2010). However, more recent data suggests that HCLS itself may interact 
directly with chromatin as part of a multi-protein gene regulating complex (Liu and Zempleni, 
2014; Zempleni et al., 2012a). Currently, an effect of biotin on MS through control of gene 
expression by modification of chromatin structure remains speculative. 
6. Feasibility of high-dose biotin as a therapy for progressive MS 
Several characteristics of high-dose biotin make it an attractive therapeutic option in 
progressive MS. Biotin demonstrates high (~100%) bioavailability (Zempleni and Mock, 
1999) and is able to cross the blood brain barrier (Spector and Mock, 1988b). The ability to 
dose orally will greatly facilitate treatment for individuals with MS and consequently a high

level of treatment compliance can be expected. While the body of preclinical toxicology data 
for high-dose biotin is limited, the available data indicates that only marginal adverse 
effects are observed in animals treated with biotin doses in the hundreds of milligrams 
per kilogram of body weight range (Hathcock, 2015). Adverse events in patients with 
progressive MS treated with MD1003 (100–300 mg/day) were infrequent; occurring in three 
of 23 (13%) patients treated in the compassionate use open-label trial (Sedel et al., 2015). 
Two patients experienced transient diarrhea and one patient died from cardiac failure 36 
months after treatment onset. This patient exhibited mild aortic valvulopathy with dilatation of 
the ascending aorta together with a first-degree atrio-ventricular block which were found 18 
months after treatment onset; no relation could be established between treatment onset, 
mild cardiac abnormalities and death. Whether these abnormalities existed before 
treatment is unknown.  
A significant teratogenic effect on rabbit fetuses during the period of organogenesis was 
observed in pregnant rabbits treated with high-dose biotin (30 mg/kg/day; approximately 
twice the equivalent human dose currently under investigation based on the surface area 
conversion table; unpublished data, MedDay Pharmaceuticals). These effects included a 
higher incidence of malrotated paw (11.8%), domed head (4.1%), hydrocephaly (4.1%) and 
liquid content in the cranial cavity (4.7%) compared with control rabbits and those treated 
with 15 mg/kg/day biotin. Consequently, high-dose biotin may not be suitable for 
administration to women with MS who are pregnant or considering pregnancy. Fingolimod, 
teriflunomide and interferon beta-1a are also contraindicated in pregnant women (although 
pregnancy may start while the patient is receiving interferon beta-1a) (Biogen Idec Ltd., 
2014; Novartis Europharm Ltd., 2011; Sanofi-Aventis Group, 2013). Control of pregnancy is 
recommended prior to each infusion of natalizumab and discontinuation of treatment should 
be considered if a women becomes pregnant while taking this drug (Biogen Idec Ltd., 2011). 
Overall, high-dose biotin appears to be a practical and well-tolerated therapeutic option in 
patients with progressive MS, particularly when compared with currently approved

treatments for MS that have some significant safety and tolerability concerns. Patients 
receiving fingolimod require close monitoring due to the risk of serious cardiovascular 
complications, infections, and macular edema (Wingerchuk and Carter, 2014). Monoclonal 
antibodies such as natalizumab and alemtuzumab require parenteral administration which 
can be inconvenient for patients, and these agents have potentially serious side effects, 
such as the risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy with natalizumab 
(Bloomgren et al., 2012) and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and antibody-mediated 
immune diseases for alemtuzumab (Cuker et al., 2011). While nonmyeloablative 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation appears to be a promising treatment option for 
patients with RRMS (Burt et al., 2015), this procedure will not be suitable for all patients and 
is associated with significant risks. 
7. Overview of ongoing studies with MD1003 and future directions 
In summary, we hypothesize that high-dose biotin treatment is targeting two key 
pathophysiological mechanisms in progressive MS: (1) by triggering myelin synthesis by 
oligodendrocytes and (2) by replenishing ATP in hypoxic neurons (Figure 4). Targeting both 
demyelination and neurodegeneration is likely to be important in the treatment of progressive 
MS. Although several other therapeutics that target one of these processes are currently 
under investigation in patients with MS, high-dose biotin might be simultaneously preventing 
the hypoxia-driven neurodegeneration of neurons and promoting the remyelination of axons.  
The efficacy and safety of MD1003 is currently under investigation in three multicenter phase 
III placebo-controlled trials in patients with progressive MS involving either the spinal cord or 
chronic visual loss after optic neuritis, and in patients with AMN (Table 1). The study in 
patients with spinal progressive MS represents a particularly ambitious evaluation of high-
dose biotin as a therapy for MS, because the patients recruited to this trial have relatively 
severe disease: PPMS or SPMS fulfilling revised McDonald criteria (Polman et al., 2011) 
and Lublin criteria (Lublin and Reingold, 1996) with clinical evidence of spastic paraparesis

and significant disability (EDSS scores 4.5–7). Furthermore, this is the first trial of an 
investigational MS therapy that has chosen a reduction in MS-related disability as the 
primary efficacy endpoint of the trial, as measured by one of two validated clinical 
assessment scales (the EDSS and the TW25). Results from all three trials are expected in 
2015–2016. Several in vivo studies that will further investigate the pharmacodynamic effects 
of high-dose biotin are also currently underway. 
The potential mechanism of action of high-dose biotin in progressive MS is still partly 
speculative and there is a striking lack of pre-clinical data on the exact mechanism of action. 
Some important gaps in knowledge remain to be elucidated experimentally:  
(1) Are biotin or malonyl-CoA limiting factors for remyelination in chronic MS lesions? 
This might be addressed using in vitro models such as OPCs. 
(2)  Does biotin have an impact on myelination or remyelination in vivo? This could be 
assessed in relevant animal models with and without inflammation such as 
experimental auto-immune encephalomyelitis, cuprizone or toxin-induced 
demyelination. 
(3) Does high-dose biotin increase ATP production by mitochondria in chronic MS 
lesions? This might be assessed in relevant in vitro and in vivo models.

cofactor for ACC. ACC is the rate limiting and committing step for the synthesis of malonyl-
CoA, the building block for fatty acids synthesis. ACC activity is detected at a high level in 
oligodendrocytes in the brain. It is hypothesized that high doses of biotin may result in 
increased fatty acid synthesis required for myelin repair.

Figure 2. Increased axonal energy demand as a result from axon demyelination. Nerve 
impulses in myelinated axons propagate between the nodes of Ranvier. Depolarization of 
the membrane is triggered by the transient opening of voltage-gated Na+ ion channels. 
Repolarization is achieved through voltage-gated K+ ion channels, which restore electrical 
conditions, followed by restoration of the ionic distribution by the ATP-dependent Na+/K+ 
ATPase pump. ATP consumption is greatly increased in demyelinated axons due to 
redistribution of ion channels along the length of the denuded axon.

Figure 3. Biotin increases ATP production in axonal mitochondria. Biotin is a co-
enzyme for PC, PCC, and MCC, three carboxylases involved in the metabolism of pyruvate 
and amino acids. These three enzymes are expressed in neurons and their actions 
ultimately result in the production of key intermediates of the TCA cycle including 
oxaloacetate, acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA. The TCA cycle produces one ATP molecule for 
every acetyl-CoA used. We hypothesize that high doses of biotin may result in increased 
ATP production in demyelinating neurons.

Figure 4. Overview of putative mechanism of action of high-dose biotin in multiple 
sclerosis. Targets of biotin are: (a) ACC: acetyl-CoA carboxylase (b) PC: pyruvate 
carboxylase, (c) PCC: propionyl-CoA carboxylase, (d) MCC: methylcrotonyl-CoA 
carboxylase. Activation of ACC may increase myelin synthesis in oligodendrocytes and 
remyelination whereas activation of PC, PCC, and MCC may lead to increase ATP 
production in neurons (and astrocytes).

Targeting demyelination and virtual hypoxia with high-dose biotin as a treatment for 
progressive multiple sclerosis  
Frédéric Sedel, Delphine Bernard, Donald M Mock, Ayman Tourbah 
 
Highlights 
• High-dose biotin is a promising novel treatment for progressive multiple sclerosis 
• 300 mg biotin daily improved MS-related disability in an open-label study 
• Biotin is essential for fatty acid synthesis and energy production 
• High-dose biotin may promote axonal remyelination by enhancing myelin production 
• High-dose biotin may also reduce axonal hypoxia through enhanced energy production
