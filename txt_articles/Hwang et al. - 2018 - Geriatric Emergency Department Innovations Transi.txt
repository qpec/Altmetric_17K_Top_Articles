OBJECTIVES: To examine the effect of an emergency
department (ED)-based transitional care nurse (TCN) on
hospital use.
DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort.
SETTING: Three U.S. (NY, IL, NJ) EDs from January 1,
2013, to June 30, 2015.
PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 65 and older in the ED
(N = 57,287).
INTERVENTION: The intervention was first TCN con-
tact. Controls never saw a TCN during the study period.
MEASUREMENTS: We examined sociodemographic and
clinical characteristics associated with TCN use and out-
comes. The primary outcome was inpatient admission dur-
ing the index ED visit (admission on Day 0). Secondary
outcomes
included
cumulative
30-day
admission
(any
admission on Days 0–30) and 72-hour ED revisits.
RESULTS: A TCN saw 5,930 (10%) individuals, 42% of
whom were admitted. After accounting for observed selec-
tion bias using entropy balance, results showed that when
compared to controls, TCN contact was associated with
lower risk of admission (site 1: �9.9% risk of inpatient
admission, 95% confidence interval (CI) = �12.3% to
�7.5%; site 2: �16.5%, 95% CI = �18.7% to �14.2%;
site 3: �4.7%, 95% CI = �7.5% to �2.0%). Participants
with TCN contact had greater risk of a 72-hour ED revisit
at two sites (site 1: 1.5%, 95% CI = 0.7–2.3%; site 2:
1.4%, 95% CI = 0.7–2.1%). Risk of any admission within
30 days of the index ED visit also remained lower for
TCN patients at both these sites (site 1: �7.8%, 95%
CI = �10.3%
to
�5.3%;
site
2:
�13.8%,
95%
CI = �16.1% to �11.6%).

T
he U.S. healthcare system simultaneously faces rising
inpatient costs and inefficient and inequitable care,
with
variable
application
of
evidence-based
practices.
These pressures may significantly affect one of the most
vulnerable populations, older adults, at times of acute ill-
ness or injury.1 An emergency department (ED) visit is
often described as a sentinel event signifying a breakdown
in care coordination for older adults.2,3 With the ED at
the crossroads of multiple healthcare settings, it has been
described as “a portal of entry to inpatient care.”4–7 Both
hospitalization and being discharged from the ED carry
significant risks for older adults, including iatrogenic com-
plications, functional and cognitive decline, and loss of
independence.8–14 This highlights the importance of greater
care to support transitions from the ED.
Programs like Geriatric Emergency Department Inno-
vations in Care through Workforce, Informatics, and
Structural Enhancements (GEDI WISE) have been devel-
oped to address these challenges. GEDI WISE was a Cen-
ter for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) Health

It is a model of geriatric emergency care in 3 large, urban
hospitals (Mount Sinai Medical Center (MSMC), New
York, NY; St. Joseph’s Regional Medical Center (SJRMC),
Paterson, NJ; Northwestern Memorial Hospital (NMH),
Chicago, IL) that operationalizes the structural and process
interventions of the geriatric ED guidelines that national
geriatric
and
emergency
medicine
organizations
have
endorsed.16 GEDI WISE targets older adults in the ED
using geriatric clinical protocols; informatics for monitor-
ing and clinical decision-making; and structural enhance-
ments to meet the triple aim of better geriatric emergency
care, better older adult health, and lower health care costs.
GEDI WISE includes an ED-based transitional care nurse
(TCN) program to identify individuals with geriatric-speci-
fic health-related needs and coordinate their transition
from ED to home with the goal of avoiding inpatient
admissions.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect
of TCN exposure during an ED visit on risk of inpatient
admission, admission the days following the ED visit, and
ED revisits. We hypothesized that individuals who saw a
TCN would have lower risk of admission, lower risk of
subsequent admission, but might have more ED revisits.
METHODS
Study Design, Setting, and Participants
This was a prospective observational cohort study of indi-
viduals aged 65 and older with an ED visit at a GEDI
WISE hospital during the program implementation period
(January 1, 2013 to July 30, 2015 for MSMC and SJRMC;
April 1, 2013 to July 30, 2015 for NMH) (Table 1).
To evaluate the effect of the TCN intervention, indi-
viduals exposed to the TCN at least once during the study
period were included in the intervention group. Individuals
with no TCN contact during the study period were in the
control group. All comparisons were performed with the
unit of analysis restricted to the first TCN contact for
the treated group and the first ED visit for the control
group (henceforth defined as the index visit) during the
study period. Analyses were stratified according to site
using standardized data for all 3 sites.
Intervention
The GEDI WISE TCN intervention consisted of emergency
nurses trained to facilitate care transitions of older adults
in the ED to the community with the goal of avoiding
inpatient admission when possible. This included evalua-
tion of functional and cognitive impairment, physical
frailty, and medical complexities common in older adults
that often limit their ability to navigate the outpatient
healthcare system. Sites customized the TCN intervention
to address patient needs and site-specific resources avail-
able, reflecting best practices for implementation projects.
The TCN model at NMH and MSMC have been previ-
ously described.17,18
At all sites, the TCN was a nurse or nurse practi-
tioner. Individuals who saw the TCN were assessed for
cognitive
function
(Short
Portable
Mental
Status
Questionnaire19
or
Mini-Cog20),
delirium
(Confusion
Assessment Method (CAM),21 Richmond Agitation Seda-
tion Scale,22 or CAM for the intensive care unit23), func-
tional status (Katz activities of daily living),24 falls risk
(Timed Up and Go Test),25 care transitions (Care Transi-
tions Measure-3),26 and caregiver strain (Modified Care-
giver Strain Index). Choice of GEDI WISE assessments
was
based on
preexisting
hospital programs
or
staff
choice.
The TCN initiated interdisciplinary ED geriatric care
using resources available to the ED based on physical,
functional, cognitive, or other needs identified during the
GEDI WISE assessment. Thus, the individual’s assessment
and transitional care needs determined the extent of ED
resources delivered; some required little support, others
required extensive transitional resources. All TCN interac-
tions were recorded in the medical record or in logs that
staff kept and imported to a secure database from the
institutions’ data warehouses.
The TCN intervention had limited staffing and thus
targeted patients based on criteria or availability. At
MSMC, individuals with an Identification of Senior At

 Risk (ISAR)27 score of 4 or higher, an Emergency Severity
Index (ESI)28 of 3 or higher, hospital discharge 30 days
before the index ED visit, or request by ED clinicians were
eligible to see the TCN, who was available 7 days a week
from 11:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. At NMH, individuals with
an ISAR score of 3 or higher or at the request of the ED
clinicians saw the TCN on weekdays from 9:00 a.m. to
8:00 p.m. At SJRMC, all individuals aged 65 and older
placed in the geriatric ED zone on weekdays from 9:00
a.m. to 5:00 p.m. were evaluated. At all sites, the TCN
evaluated individuals only when the TCN was available.
Thus, many did not receive the intervention for reasons
unrelated to risk factors and so were similar to those who
received the intervention. We sought to identify these con-
trols who were eligible for the TCN intervention, were
similarly sick, and had similar likelihood of discharge but
not see the TCN.
Intervention participants were defined as having any
TCN contact, regardless of duration or extent of geriatric
care provided. TCN contact was identified according to
medical
record
reports,
consultation
requests,
visits
recorded in the TCN logs, and documentation of a TCN
geriatric assessment.
Data
Data were collected from electronic health record reports
and institution data warehouses. Through a data use
agreement, NMH and SJRMC transmitted files securely to
MSMC to create a standardized 3-site database. There
were 58,310 unique individual ED visits during the study
period. Because the TCN did not target individuals with
high acuity, our analysis focused on 57,287 individuals
with an ESI score greater than 1.
Use Outcomes
The primary outcome was inpatient admission on the
index ED visit (admission on Day 0). Observation admis-
sions were excluded because they were not available at all
sites. Secondary outcomes for participants discharged dur-
ing the index ED visit included any subsequent 72-hour
ED revisit and any inpatient admission within 30 days of
the index ED visit.
Analysis
Analyses were conducted according to site; data were not
pooled because hospitals varied in clinical implementation,
TCN workflow, and duration of geriatric ED programs
(e.g., SJRMC had had a geriatric ED program since 2009,
whereas NMH established one in 2013).
Individuals receiving and not receiving TCN contact
may have differed in systematic ways that could bias our
intervention effect estimates if not accounted for in analy-
ses. To account for selection bias and ensure that interven-
tion and control group participants were as similar as
possible, we used entropy balancing29–31 to obtain a
weighted comparison group with covariate means and dis-
tributions similar to those of the TCN (intervention) group
for each site. We completed multivariable regression mod-
eling on the weighted datasets.
Entropy Balancing
In entropy balancing, treated individuals (TCN intervention)
are assigned a weight of 1. Comparison (control) individuals
are assigned weights so that, in the aggregate, the means of
dichotomous variables and the means and variances of con-
tinuous variables are equal for the intervention and control
participants. Weights for controls are then normalized so
that their sum equals the number of treated individuals.
Entropy balancing is akin to survey weighting, in which
weights are assigned to respondents so that their characteris-
tics are representative of the population from which they
were derived.29 Entropy balancing allowed us to create a
comparison control group similar to the TCN group, except
for receipt of the TCN intervention.31,32
Our treatment and comparison groups were balanced
on the following (measured during the index ED visit): risk
of adverse outcome (ESI: 2 (more urgent), 3, 4–5 (less
urgent);28 ISAR: 0–1 vs ≥227), likelihood of not encounter-
ing TCN intervention (index ED visit occurred at night
(9:00 p.m. to 9:00 a.m.) or on the weekend (yes/no);
placement in a geriatric ED structural environment (yes/
no)), overall clinical status (discharge from hospital in pre-
vious 30 days; Charlson comorbidity score (0, 1, 2, 3,
≥4);33 the 6 most common chief complaints at all sites for
older adults (pain, falls, difficulty breathing, weakness,
altered mental status, psychiatric)), and sociodemographic
characteristics (age; sex). Balance in covariates across
treatment groups was assessed using standardized differ-
ences, with differences of less than 10% considered ideal.
Regression Models
Adjusted regression models on weighted samples allowed
us to account for potential covariate imbalance that could
remain after entropy balancing, allowing a doubly robust
estimation.34,35 Models included all covariates used to cre-
ate entropy balance weights.34,35 Within each site, we esti-
mated a multinomial logistic regression model to examine
the relationship between TCN intervention and 3 potential
outcomes: discharge with no ED revisit within 72 hours
(the ideal outcome and reference category), discharge with
an ED revisit within 72 hours, and hospital admission.
Results are presented as incremental average marginal
effects (AMEs) by percent change (i.e., mean change in
likelihood of hospital admission when a participant is
moved from the control group to the TCN group, holding
all other covariates at their weighted values). Logistic
regression was used to examine the relationship between
TCN intervention and hospital admission within 30 days.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted with the comparison
groups being restricted to ED patients that arrived only
during daytime hours and weekdays. (Table S1).
All analyses were conducted using Stata version 14.2
(Stata Corp., College Station, TX). The institutional review
boards at all 3 sites approved this evaluation.
RESULTS
During the study period, 57,287 individuals aged 65 and
older with an ESI greater than 1 made 120,221 ED visits
at the 3 participating hospitals. Ten percent were exposed

rate of Day 0 inpatient admission of individuals aged 65

46%, NMH 35%, SJRMC 44%).
With entropy balancing, we created weighted compar-
ison groups for each site that were similar to the TCN

intervention
(Table 2). After balancing, standardized differences in risk
for adverse outcomes, clinical characteristics, and sociode-
mographic characteristics approached 0 (Figure 1).
In bivariate analyses of balanced samples, individuals
receiving TCN care on their index ED visit had signifi-
cantly lower Day 0 inpatient admission rates than controls
at all 3 hospitals (MSMC: 36% TCN vs 46% control,
P < .001; NMH: 36% TCN vs 53% control, P < .001;
SJRMC: 46% TCN vs 51% control, P = .01). Participants
with TCN contact discharged from the ED during the
index visit were significantly more likely than controls to
have a 72-hour ED revisit at MSMC (3% TCN vs 2%
control, P = .03) but not at SJRMC (3% vs 2%, P = .77)
or NMH (3% vs 1%, P = .06). Lower rates of any inpa-
tient admission from Days 0 to 30 for TCN participants
were sustained at MSMC (43% TCN vs 51% control,
P < .001)
and
NMH
(42%
TCN
vs
56%
control,
P < .001) but not SJRMC (52% TCN vs 53% control,
P = .43).
In multivariable logistic regression models, many of
these findings persisted. From the multinomial model,
TCN participants at all sites were less likely to require a
Day 0 inpatient admission than those discharged with
no 72-hour ED revisits (meaning they did not come back
to the ED for a second visit within 72 hours) (MSMC:
AME = �9.9%,

SJRMC:

NMH, there was a greater risk of 72-hour ED revisit for
TCN participants than for those who were discharged and
did not return to the ED (MSMC: AME = 1.5%, 95%
CI = 0.7–2.3; NMH: AME = 1.4%, 95% CI = 0.7–2.1)
but not at SJRMC. From logistic regression, participants
at MSMC and NMH were less likely to have any inpatient
admission
in
the
subsequent
30 days
(MSMC:

DISCUSSION
At a time of increasing pressure to deliver efficient health-
care to an aging population that often requires greater ser-
vices, opportunities to improve quality and reduce use are
needed. With more than one-third of U.S. outpatient care
delivered in the acute care setting,36 the ED is a significant
place for medical decision making, conduit for inpatient
admissions, and setting not only where safety net care is
delivered, but also where care transition programs can be
integrated.37
In this study, individuals exposed to a TCN had a signifi-
cantly lower risk of inpatient admission during the index ED
visit at all 3 hospitals, and for 2 of the 3 hospitals, this risk
persisted over the subsequent 30 days. We anticipated that
an initiative designed to decrease inpatient admissions might
result in greater ED use if the discharge was unsuccessful.
This occurred at 2 of the hospitals, although the likelihood of
admission from Day 0 to 30 remained lower for the TCN
group. At a time when the national average for ED admis-
sions with older adults is a third being admitted,38 ED-based
programs that can reduce this risk are significant in their
potential for impact – especially at these study hospitals with
higher than national average rates of admission of older
adults (35–46%). At the GEDI WISE hospitals, the TCNs
saw approximately 10% of individuals in the ED and were
able to reduce the risk of admission for these patients by 5%
to 16%.
The ED-based TCN intervention is unique in its focus
on averting inpatient admissions for older adults while in
the ED. Hospital and community-based care coordination
programs aimed at improving outcomes and reducing
unnecessary healthcare use for older adults have prolifer-
ated over the last 2 decades. Evidence of the effect of these
programs on admissions is mixed,39,40 and none have been
ED based with a strategy to avoid hospitalization during
the ED visit. Other ED-based programs have focused on
coordination of care and transitions at the end of an ED
visit or post-ED discharge of individuals expected to be or
already discharged from the ED—when there is limited or
no time to avoid hospitalization from the ED for those
already admitted.41 Some programs have demonstrated
early evidence of success with comprehensive geriatric
assessments and interdisciplinary teams that have kept
discharged individuals from future admissions and ED
visits,42–44 but these studies were limited in terms of sin-
gle-site evaluation and methodology or were not systemati-
cally evaluated for effect.40,41 None of these programs
attempted to avert and analyze risk of inpatient admissions
for older adults presenting to the ED.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to show a sig-
nificant decrease in hospitalization risk through an ED-
based geriatric assessment and care transitions program.45
Many people seen in the ED setting appropriately require
inpatient admission, and older adults have higher rates of
admission than the general population,46 but retrospective
review of existing hospitalization data indicates that many
of these admissions may be avoidable.47 Hospitalization of
older adults has significant risks of iatrogenic complica-
tions, including potentially inappropriate medication pre-
scribing.8 During and after hospitalization, many older
adults experience functional decline and deconditioning,
worse quality of life, cognitive decline, and loss of indepen-
dence.9–13 More than 30% of older adults develop hospital-
ization-associated disability. After an acute admission,
many older adults do not return to their previous functional
state and often acquire additional geriatric syndromes.13
Although potentially preventable admissions have decreased
over the past decade, the basis for this decrease remains
uncertain, and the challenge remains in providing assess-
ments and programs to support the safe discharge of older
adults from the ED. The ED may play a significant role in
changing the trajectory and impact of these adverse effects
and sequelae of hospitalization on older adults.
This study has several limitations. Although entropy bal-
ancing was used to account for observed selection bias, there
may be unobserved confounders associated with TCN use

 and usage outcomes. Outcomes for individuals who may have
gone to other hospitals could not be evaluated. Exposure to
the intervention was defined as any contact from the TCN.
The degree to which the TCN provided and facilitated care
transitions for individual participants was not measured. The
implementation and operationalization of the TCN interven-
tion, which patients they saw, and what resources were avail-
able to older adults varied across the 3 sites. These differences,
along with duration of geriatric emergency care programs at
each site, may account for the variation in outcomes between
sites. The reduction in hospital admission risk at SJRMC was
smaller than at the other 2 hospitals. This effect attenuated
and became insignificant over the subsequent 30 days.
SJRMC had a geriatric ED program for several years before
implementation of the GEDI WISE programs. The baseline
opportunity for improvement may have already changed with
earlier programs and thus the hospital may have been suscep-
tible to contamination bias. Analyses also could not account
for other programs and policies at the hospitals that may have
influenced the outcomes presented (e.g., other departmental
transition programs, policies targeting inpatient admissions).
This is why analyses were stratified according to site and not
pooled. Nevertheless, even with the known variability in inter-
vention implementation not only according to site, but also
within site, we observed a consistent and significantly lower
risk of admission for individuals who saw a TCN, strengthen-
ing our results that may be conservative in estimated effects. It
is likely that our approach of evaluating only the first TCN
contact, regardless of intensity, provides conservative esti-
mates of the intervention’s potential effect on outcomes evalu-
ated here. Further research is needed to observe and evaluate
how TCN care is provided, what elements of the care transi-
tions processes and care coordination were delivered, and the
amount of time spent on each person and to determine which
of these are associated with better outcomes. These findings
should be replicated in a randomized control trial in the ED
setting to demonstrate causal effect.
In summary, programs focused on improving care
transitions for older adults seen in the ED may be an effec-
tive way to reduce risk of inpatient admission during an
ED visit (and the following 30 days) but may lead to an
increase in ED revisit rates. Targeted evaluation by clini-
cally trained nursing staff focused on improving the ED
transitions of care may be an effective delivery innovation
to reduce likelihood of hospital admission, subsequent
complications, loss of function and independence associ-
ated with hospitalizations, and costly inpatient care.
