Abstract
Platelets are critical for hemostasis, thrombosis, and inflammatory responses1,2, yet the events 
leading to mature platelet production remain incompletely understood3. The bone marrow (BM) is 
proposed to be a major site of platelet production although indirect evidence points towards a 
potential pulmonary contribution to platelet biogenesis4-7. By directly imaging the lung 
microcirculation in mice8, we discovered that a large number of megakaryocytes (MKs) circulate 
through the lungs where they dynamically release platelets. MKs releasing platelets in the lung are 
of extrapulmonary origin, such as the BM, where we observed large MKs migrating out of the BM

 space. The lung contribution to platelet biogenesis is substantial with approximately 50% of total 
platelet production or 10 million platelets per hour. Furthermore, we identified populations of 
mature and immature MKs along with hematopoietic progenitors that reside in the extravascular 
spaces of the lung. Under conditions of thrombocytopenia and relative stem cell deficiency in the 
BM9, these progenitors can migrate out of the lung, repopulate the BM, completely reconstitute 
blood platelet counts, and contribute to multiple hematopoietic lineages. These results position the 
lung as a primary site of terminal platelet production and an organ with considerable 
hematopoietic potential.
Platelets are released from MKs, but incredibly, since their discovery in the 19th century, we 
incompletely understand the mechanisms by which platelets are produced. Based on 
previous work showing the presence of MKs in the lung10 and more platelets and fewer 
MKs in the blood exiting than entering the lungs4,11, we hypothesized that the lung could 
have a major role in platelet biogenesis, and directly investigated this process using lung 2-
photon intravital microscopy (2PIVM) and fluorescent mouse strains. We used PF4-Cre × 
mTmG (hereafter called PF4-mTmG) reporter mice, in which PF4-Cre12 drives membrane 
GFP expression in MKs and platelets, while all other cells are labeled with membrane 
tomato, and observed large circulating GFP+ cells pass through the lung microcirculation 
where they produce GFP+ extensions in a flow-dependent manner (Fig. 1a-b and 
Supplementary Video 1). These events strikingly resembled proplatelet and preplatelet 
formation from cultured MKs3,13,14. In the lung, the entire sequence of these events varied 
from approximately 20 to 60 minutes (Fig. 1a-b and Supplementary Video 1). Many of the 
GFP+ cells contained large nuclei (>10 μm), which appeared as unlabeled dark holes that 
remained intact during this process (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Video 2) and resulted in 
naked intravascular nuclei after platelets were released (Supplementary Video 2). We 
confirmed that we labeled large mobile nucleated cells by imaging the lung microcirculation 
of PF4-Cre × nTnG (hereafter called PF4-nTnG) reporter mice, in which a fluorescence 
switch allows GFP+ nuclei to be tracked (Extended Data Fig. 1a and Supplementary Video 
3).
We next quantified the GFP+ MKs/proplatelets in the PF4-mTmG lung by assigning surface 
volumes (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Video 4). The putative MKs (large GFP+ cells 
undergoing platelet release) had median volumes of 10,000 μm3 and diameters of >25 μm 
(Fig. 1d, e), while the putative platelets (small circulating GFP+ events) had median volumes 
of <10 μm3 and diameters of 2-3 μm (Fig. 1d, e), values that are consistent with previous 
estimates for MKs and platelet sizes3. For each large GFP+ cell undergoing platelet release, 
we calculated the number of platelets that could be liberated in the lung circulation, and this 
ranged from <500 platelets for small-sized MKs or proplatelets to >1000 platelets for larger-
sized MKs (Fig. 1f), with a median of ∼500 platelets per MK. Previous studies have 
estimated wide ranges for the number of platelets produced from a single MK (200-10,000 
platelets)15-17. Our method uses direct measurement for each event, presumably yielding 
more accurate estimates. Altogether, we analyzed 20 hours of movies from 10 different 
mice, and observed an average of 2.2 ± 0.26 (n=10) MKs per hour in an imaged volume of 
lung of 0.07 mm3 (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Video 5). When extrapolated to the entire 
lung volume, this equals >10 million platelets produced per hour from the lungs (Fig. 1h,

 Methods, and Extended Data Table 1). Overall, when adjusted for platelet lifespan and 
splenic sequestration, we estimate that the lung is responsible for approximately 50% of 
total platelet production in the mouse (Fig. 1i, Methods, and Extended Data Table 1). Blood 
platelet counts were unchanged after 2PIVM (Extended Data Fig 1b). Lung platelet 
production is also biologically tunable, since the administration of the MK growth factor, 
thrombopoietin (TPO), increases blood platelets by 3-fold (Fig. 1j) and the number of MKs 
undergoing proplatelet formation observed per hour by 2-fold (3.9 ± 0.38, n=9) (Fig. 1k). 
We conclude from these experiments that the lung is a primary site of platelet biogenesis.
To investigate the origin of the intravascular MKs/proplatelets in the lung, we used a novel 
approach to adoptively transfer lung resident cells—the orthotopic single lung transplant 
model in mice18. We transplanted a mTmG lung (no Cre or GFP expression) into a PF4-
mTmG recipient and vice versa (Extended Data Fig 1c-e and Supplementary Video 6). 
Using 2PIVM, we observed proplatelet formation from GFP+ MKs in the lung vasculature 
following mTmG → PF4-mTmG lung transplants, but not in the reverse transplant (PF4-
mTmG → mTmG). These experiments confirmed that MKs releasing platelets in the lung 
circulation are of extrapulmonary origin. We hypothesized that the BM19, spleen, or liver 
could be the source of these intravascular MKs/proplatelets. We imaged the calvarial BM 
(Extended Data Fig. 1f) and the spleen in PF4-mTmG mice and observed extravascular MKs 
releasing proplatelets into the sinusoids of the BM (Fig. 1l, Extended Data Fig. 1g, and 
Supplementary Video 7) and spleen (Extended Data Fig. 1i and Supplementary Video 9). In 
the BM, we also observed large MKs exiting the BM space (Fig. 1m and Supplementary 
Video 8). In contrast to observations in the lung, we did not observe any intravascular MKs 
undergoing proplatelet formation. We did not observe any MKs in the liver (Extended Data 
Fig. 1h).
In addition to intravascular MKs, we also observed large cells in the perivascular lung 
interstitium in PF4-Cre × ROSA26-tdTomato (hereafter called PF4-tomato) and PF4-mTmG 
mice (Fig. 2a,b, Extended Data Fig. 2a, and Supplementary Video 10), and in PF4-
mTmG→mTmG lung transplants (Extended Data Fig. 2b). These extravascular cells were 
sessile during our imaging (up to 4 hours) and contained large nuclei (Fig. 2c). While 
comparatively large, these extravascular cells were on average one-third the volume and 
approximately half the diameter of the intravascular MKs (Fig. 2d) and also smaller than 
resident MKs in the BM and spleen (Extended Data Fig. 2c-e). Using image analysis, we 
detected ∼2000 PF4-tomato cells per mm3 of lung tissue or >1 million cells per lung (Fig. 
2e). The nuclear diameters of these cells were significantly larger than non-GFP+ cells (Fig. 
2f) and had more complex shapes (Fig. 2g). We used a method of intravascular labeling prior 
to lung digestion20 to determine the relative proportion of intra- vs. extravascular MKs (Fig. 
2i) and found that 85% of PF4-tomato events are extravascular and 15% intravascular (Fig. 
2j).
To further characterize lung MKs, we sorted PF4-tomato+ and CD41+ cells from perfused 
and digested lungs and stained with the MK/platelet marker, von Willebrand factor, (vWF). 
The large, PF4-tomato+/CD41+ cells with complex nuclei also stained positive for vWF in a 
granular pattern, which is consistent with MKs (Fig. 2h). To avoid cell aggregation with 
PF4-tomato+ platelets during flow cytometry staining, we prepared digested lungs from PF4-

 nTnG mice where GFP is targeted to the cell nucleus and thus does not stain anucleate 
platelets. We gated on nGFP+/CD41+ events as the putative lung MK pool (Fig. 2k and 
Extended Data Fig. 3a) and this population co-stained for the MK/platelet-specific markers, 
glycoprotein VI (GP VI) and the TPO receptor c-Mpl (Fig. 2k), but did not stain for markers 
of other lung resident cells, such as F4/80 for macrophages (Fig. 2k and Extended Data Fig. 
3a-d) confirming that these lung-derived cells are MKs. The majority of the nGFP+ cells in 
the lung are CD41- (Extended Data Fig. 3b), but both CD41+ and negative cells co-stain for 
GPVI and c-Mpl confirming their MK lineage (Extended Data Fig. 3c). The nGFP+/CD41- 
cells have a more immature profile with lower CD61 and CD42b expression, smaller size 
and lower DNA content than the nGFP+/CD41+ cells (Extended Data Fig.3e-i). Overall, lung 
MKs are more immature than BM MKs (Extended Data Fig 3j-m), but the total number of 
MKs in the lung is comparable to the BM (Fig. 2l-m). We also used RNA-sequencing to 
characterize lung and BM MKs in PF4-nTnG mice (nGFP+/CD41+ cells). We discovered 
over 700 differentially-expressed genes (Extended Data Fig. 4a, Supplementary Table 1) 
with many MK/platelet pathways represented in both groups, but with less expression of 
mature MK markers in the lung group (Extended Data Fig. 4b,c) consistent with our 
profiling by immunostaining.
Lung 2PIVM indicated that only the intravascular MKs were active in the release of 
platelets. To test the function of extravascular MKs in the lung, we used the orthotopic single 
lung transplant model to adoptively transfer lung resident cells. PF4-tomato donor lungs 
were extensively perfused and the left lung was immediately transplanted into wild-type 
(WT) or c-mpl-/- thrombocytopenic recipients (Fig. 3a). These transplanted mice were 
injected with TPO at 3 and 40 days post-transplantation and bled weekly to track the 
numbers of platelets (Fig. 3a, c). Peripheral blood tomato+ events after lung transplantation 
are by definition of donor lung origin. In WT recipients, we detected low-level (1-2% of 
total CD41+ events) and transient production of tomato+ events (Fig. 3d, Extended Data 5i). 
However, in the majority (70%) of c-mpl-/- recipients, we detected a large and sustained (90 
days) production of tomato+ events (Fig. 3c, d and Extended Data Fig. 5c, d) that fully 
reconstituted platelet counts (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 5g, h). We observed the same 
response in 2 out of 5 c-mpl-/- recipients not treated with TPO post-transplantation 
(Extended Data Fig. 5a, b, e, f). The tomato+/CD41+ events were also CD42+, GPVI+, and 
c-Mpl+ (Extended Data Fig. 6a, b) and expressed CD62P when stimulated with thrombin 
(Extended Data Fig. 6c-e), confirming their platelet nature.
In selected experiments, c-mpl-/- lung transplant recipients were followed for up to 10 
months post-transplantation and we observed sustained production of tomato+ platelets and 
sustained reconstitution of platelet counts (Extended Data Fig. 5j, k). Since the platelet 
lifespan is 3-5 days in mice21, the persistence of donor-origin platelets for >3 months 
suggested the presence in the transplanted lung of a progenitor population capable of long-
term reconstitution of mature MKs/platelets. Indeed, the smaller size of the extravascular 
MKs compared to the intravascular MKs in the lung and to the extravascular MKs in the BM 
and spleen could point to the presence of MK progenitors.
We imaged lungs at 3 months post-transplantation and confirmed the persistence of PF4-
tomato cells (Extended Data Fig. 7a). We also detected the presence of tomato+/CD41+ cells

 in the BM of PF4-tomato→c-mpl-/- lung transplant recipients using flow cytometry (Fig. 3e) 
and immunofluorescence (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 7b). To test for lung MK 
progenitors and to track donor cells in recipient mice, we performed mTmG→c-mpl-/- lung 
transplants where all cells and platelets are tomato+ (Extended Data Fig.7c-e). We next 
quantified the numbers of MkP in the BM of mTmG→c-mpl-/- lung transplant recipients by 
staining myeloid progenitors (MP; Lin-/Sca-1-/c-Kit+) for CD41 and CD150 (Fig. 3g)22. We 
found increased MP and MkP in the BM of the lung transplant recipients relative to c-mpl-/- 
BM, which was similar to the frequency of MP and MkP normally found in the BM of WT 
(mTmG) mice (Fig. 3h and Extended Data Fig. 7f,g). One third of the MkP in the BM of 
mTmG→c-mpl-/- BM were tomato+ (Fig. 3i, j).
We next tested if the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) deficiency characteristic of the c-mpl-/- 
BM9 could be restored by lung transplantation. We gated on the BM LSK (Lin-/Sca-1+/c-
Kit+) population and probed for the following subsets: long-term (LT) HSCs (CD48-/
CD150+), short-term (ST) HSCs (CD48-/CD150-), multipotent progenitor (MPP) 2 (CD48+/
CD150+), and MPP3/4 (CD48+/CD150-) (Fig. 3k)23. Lung transplantation from TPO-
competent donors (mTmG) restored the LSK population deficiencies (Fig. 3l and Extended 
Data Fig. 7h-l). Lung origin MkP, LT-HSC, ST-HSC, MPP2 and MPP3/4 were also found in 
the BM, spleen and recipient lung (Fig. 3m,n and Extended Data Fig. 7n-p). A non-specific 
post-lung transplantation response was ruled out as c-mpl-/-→c-mpl-/- lung transplants did 
not produce increased platelet counts (Fig. 3b) or alter the BM composition (Extended Data 
Fig. 7m). Taken together, these results suggest that a hematopoietic progenitor population 
residing in the lung is capable of migrating to the BM and reconstituting HSC defects and 
associated cytopenias.
We tested for hematopoietic progenitors in the dispersed WT lung using similar gating on 
live CD45+/Lin-/Sca-1+/c-Kit+ cells as in the BM. We discovered that the lung contains an 
array of hematopoietic progenitors including ST-HSCs, MPP2, MPP3/4, and MP/MkP 
populations (Fig. 4a, b), which were morphologically indistinguishable from BM LSK (Fig. 
4e). These cells were present at lower numbers versus the BM (Fig. 4c, d) and spleen 
(Extended Data Fig. 8a, b), except for larger ST-HSCs in the lung versus spleen. These cells 
were extravascular as they were not removed by perfusion and were not stained by 
intravascular CD45-APC antibody (Extended Data Fig. 8c-h). To our knowledge, this is the 
first description of hematopoietic progenitor cells in the adult lung, and we reasoned that 
they could be the source of the reconstituting effects observed with lung transplantation. To 
test this hypothesis, we isolated LSK and ST-HSCs from perfused WT lungs (and the BM 
for comparison) and injected these cells intravenously (i.v.) into c-mpl-/- recipients and 
tested for the presence of c-Mpl+ platelets in the peripheral blood (Fig. 4f). Transplantation 
of lung LSK cells and ST-HSCs increased c-Mpl+ platelets and partially restored platelet 
counts similar to the effect observed with BM populations (Fig. 4g-i). These results establish 
that the adult lung contains functional hematopoietic precursors capable of migration, BM 
engraftment, and reconstitution of hematopoietic defects.
Finally, we tested whether lung hematopoietic progenitors are capable of multi-lineage BM 
reconstitution. Using mTmG donors to track mature lineages in the peripheral blood and BM 
(Extended Data Fig. 7c), we detected sustained production of donor-derived (tomato+/

 CD41-) cells in the peripheral blood of the c-mpl-/- recipient mice (Extended Data Fig. 8i, j), 
which included platelets (Extended Data Fig. 7d, e) neutrophils, and B and T cells, 
(Extended Data Fig. 8k). Considering there are no neutrophil, B or T cell defects in c-mpl-/- 
mice and therefore no impetus for donor-derived reconstitution, these results demonstrate a 
remarkable contribution of the lung to overall hematopoiesis.
Our results provide direct evidence that the lung is a major site of platelet biogenesis using a 
distinct mechanism of proplatelet release from intravascular MKs (of extrapulmonary origin) 
in the lung microcirculation (Extended Data Fig. 9a). These results open new lines of 
investigation to improve our approach to treat thrombocytopenia, which affects millions of 
patients worldwide and causes substantial morbidity and mortality. We propose that the lung 
is an ideal bioreactor for the production of mature platelets from MKs, which could advance 
studies of treating thrombocytopenia with cell-based therapies16. Beyond the mechanical 
forces that promote proplatelet formation and extension, the lung may contain unique 
signaling partners for MKs that promote platelet release. Interactions between MKs and 
endothelial cells through GPIb-vWF signaling has been shown to promote proplatelet 
formation in vitro24 and considering that vWF levels are particularly high in the pulmonary 
arteries25, this pathway could finely regulate MKs for platelet production.
The lung is a reservoir for resident MKs and hematopoietic progenitor cells (Extended Data 
Fig. 9b), which raises questions about the factors responsible for homing of these cells into 
and out of the lung, the function of these cells in the lung niche, and their roles in host 
defense26. Provocatively, MKs are a rich source of cytokines and growth factors that could 
potentially influence inflammatory/fibrotic lung diseases. Our RNA-Seq analysis revealed a 
skewing towards an innate immunity function of the lung MKs (Extended Data Fig. 4d-f and 
Supplementary Table 1) that may reflect the unique environment of the exposed lung versus 
the BM. Indeed, we detected changes in the resident and circulating lung MK populations in 
bacterial pneumonia (Extended Data Fig. 4g-k). Our findings may also find application to 
the field of lung transplantation where post-transplantation chimerism could affect acute and 
chronic allograft rejection. Our results add to the growing literature that the lung is a 
sophisticated organ capable of regeneration after major injury, a major site of platelet 
production, and with untapped potential as a contributor to hematopoiesis.
Methods
Mice
Mice were housed and bred under specific pathogen-free conditions at the University of 
California, San Francisco (UCSF) Laboratory Animal Research Center and all experiments 
conformed to ethical principles and guidelines approved by the UCSF Institutional Animal 
Care and Use Committee. Male and female mice between 8–12 weeks of age were used for 
experiments. C57BL/6, PF4-Cre, Rosa26-LSL-tdTomato, mTmG, nTnG, and BoyJ mice 
were purchased from the Jackson Laboratories. To track platelets and/or MKs, PF4-Cre 
expressing mice were crossed with Rosa26-LSL-tdTomato, mTmG or nTnG reporter strains. 
The fluorophore of PF4 expressing cells (tdTomato or GFP) is localized to the cytoplasm, 
the cell membrane, or the nucleus, respectively. c-mpl-/- mice (C57BL/6 background) were 
obtained from a Material Transfer Agreement from Genentech.

 Lung intravital imaging
We used 2PIVM to observe MK and platelet production in real-time in the mouse lung. A 
modified version27 of the previously published method of stabilized lung imaging was 
used28. Mice were anaesthetized with ketamine and xylazine and secured with tape to a 
custom heated microscope stage. A small tracheal cannula was inserted, sutured into place, 
and attached to a MiniVent mouse ventilator (Harvard Apparatus). Mice were ventilated with 
a tidal volume of 10 μl of compressed air (21% O2) per gram of mouse weight, a respiratory 
rate of 130–140 breaths per minute, and a positive-end expiratory pressure of 2–3 cm H2O. 
Isoflurane was continuously delivered to maintain anesthesia and mice were administered 
300 μl of 0.9% saline solution i.p. every hour. The mice were placed in the right lateral 
decubitus position and a small surgical incision was made to expose the rib cage. A second 
incision was then made into the intercostal space between ribs 4 and 5, through the parietal 
pleura, to expose the surface of the left lung lobe. A flanged thoracic window with 8 mm 
coverslip was then inserted between the two ribs and secured to the stage using a set of two 
optical posts and a 90° angle post clamp (Thor Labs)27,29. 20–25 mm Hg of suction was 
applied (Amvex Corporation) to gently immobilize the lung. The two-photon microscope 
objective was then lowered into place over the thoracic window. In selected experiments, to 
permit identification of the lung vasculature, FITC dextran (50 μL of 25 mg/mL; Life 
Technologies) was injected i.v. into the tail vein prior to imaging.
Spleen and Liver intravital imaging
Mice were anesthetized and ventilated as noted above. To expose the spleen, a skin incision 
was made in the left flank. To expose the liver, an incision was made along the costal margin 
to expose and externalize the liver. The same window used for lung imaging was used to 
facilitate imaging of the spleen and liver. The mouse was placed on a 37 °C temperature 
controlled heated stage for the duration of the imaging and saline solution was administered 
i.p. every hour.
Bone Marrow Intravital imaging
Mice were anesthetized with an initial dose of ketamine and xylazine and anesthesia was 
maintained with isoflurane delivered through a nose cone. Hair and the underlying 
subcutaneous tissue were removed to expose the calvarium. The periosteum was removed 
using a microsurgical knife. To stabilize the skull, we 3D printed an apparatus that was fixed 
to the mouse skull with Vetbond and attached to the heated stage below. The microscope 
objective was then lowered into a 5 mm beveled hole filled with saline.
Two-photon microscopy
Intravital imaging was performed using a Nikon A1R Multi-photon microscope equipped 
with a Mai Tai DeepSee IR Laser (Spectra Physics) (UCSF BIDC). The MaiTai laser was 
tuned to 920 nm for simultaneous excitation of GFP or FITC and tdTomato. Emitted light 
was detected using a 25× water lens (Nikon) and using green (500-550nm) and red 
(570-620nm) filters. Images were captured with a high-resolution galvano scanner (1 fps, 
512×512 px). The microscope was controlled by the NIS Element AR software (4.50). We 
captured a 1052 μm × 1578 μm x-y surface area (1.66 mm2) and z-stack images were

 acquired with z-depths of 5 μm (total of 40 μm z-depth). We captured a complete image 
every 1 minute for 120 minutes.
Image analysis
Images were analyzed using Imaris 7.6.1 (Bitplane) or NIS-Element (Nikon) software 
(UCSF BIDC). Surface analysis was performed to quantify and characterize the volume, 
diameter, or circularity of the resident and circulating MKs or platelets. MKs/MK fragments 
were defined as PF4+ events with a diameter >15 μm. Platelets were defined as PF4+ events 
with a diameter between 0.5-5 μm. To calculate the number of platelets released by each MK 
observed, the ratio of the MK/platelet volumes was calculated for each of the 35 fragmenting 
MKs/proplatelets observed during lung imaging. The number of platelets that can be 
produced by one MK and was divided into 3 groups according to size: Small (<500 platelets, 
n=18), Medium (500-1000 platelets, n=7), Large (>1000 platelets, n=10).
Quantifying platelet production in the lung (see variables in Table 1)
For each movie (∼2 hours), the MKs observed to be undergoing fragmentation in the lung 
(LungMKfrag) were quantified.
The number of platelets released by each MK undergoing fragmentation in the lung was 
calculated using the volume ratio of the MK volume to the average platelet volume.
The number of platelets produced in the lung was then calculated.
Where the Lung fraction is the ratio of the mouse total lung volume30 to the observed lung 
volume:
Finally, we estimated the contribution of the lung to overall thrombopoiesis.

 The total number of platelets produced per day is calculated according to the number of 
circulating platelets in the mouse blood divided by the life span of platelets, and taking into 
account that one-third of the produced platelets are sequestered by the spleen.
In selected experiments, mice were treated with recombinant human thrombopoietin 
(rhTPO, Genentech) i.p. (250 mg/kg), 5 days before lung imaging.
Lung, BM, spleen and blood single-cell preparation for flow cytometry or cell sorting
Lung digestion—For lung HSC or MK cell sorting, lungs were perfused before collection 
and digestion. Lungs were placed in 2 ml of PBS with 5 μL/mL DnaseI (Roche) and 0.5 
mg/mL LiberaseTM (Roche), minced with scissors in 15mL tubes, and digested 30 minutes 
at 37°C before filtration through a 100 μm cell strainer and red blood cell lysis. Samples 
were then filtered through a 40 μm filter and resuspended for subsequent FACS staining. For 
experiments where vascular localization was tested, mice were injected with i.v. CD41–APC 
(eBioscience) or CD45-APC (eBioscience) 5 min before lung collection.
BM isolation—Tibias and femurs from both legs were collected from mice following 
euthanasia. BM cells were flushed with PBS with 5mM EDTA before filtration through a 70 
μm cell strainer and red blood cell lysis.
Spleen isolation—The spleen was collected and pressed with the end of a plunger from a 
1 ml syringe into 1 mL of PBS with 5mM EDTA before filtration through a 70 μm cell 
strainer and red blood cell lysis.
Flow cytometry and cell sorting
For surface staining, cells or platelets were incubated with anti-Fc receptor antibody (clone 
2.4G2) and stained with antibodies in Hanks Buffered Salt Solution (HBSS) with 2% fetal 
calf serum and 5mM EDTA for 30 min.
Antibody clones used in these studies—CD41-APC (MWReg30, eBioscience), 
CD41-FITC (MWReg30, BD), CD41-BV421 (MWReg30, BioLegend), CD41-BV570 
(MWReg30, BioLegend), c-mpl-Biotin (AMM2, IBL) and Streptavidin PE-Cy7 (BD), 
GPVI-FITC (JAQ1, emfret), F4/80-PB (CI:A3-1, BioLegend), CD45-APC (30F11, 
BioLegend), CD42d-APC (1C2, eBioscience), CD62P-APC (Psel.KO2.3, eBioscience). 
HSCs were stained with Rat unconjugated Lin antibodies Gr-1 (RB6-8C5), Mac1 (M1/70), 
B220 (RA3-6B2), CD5 (53-7.3), CD4 (GK1.5), CD8 (53-6.7) (eBioscience), Ter-119 (BD), 
CD3 (17A2, BioLegend), goat anti-rat-PE-Cy5 (Invitrogen), c-Kit-APC-eFluor780 (2B8, 
eBioscience), Sca-1-PB (D7, BioLegend), CD48-APC (HM48-1, BioLegend), CD150-PE-
Cy7 (TC15-12F12.2, BioLegend) and CD45.2-FITC (104, eBioscience) antibodies. HSC 
and progenitors populations were defined as followed: Myeloerythroid progenitor (MP: 
Lin-/CD45+/Sca-1-/c-Kit+), MK progenitor (MkP: MP/ CD150+,CD41+), LSK 
compartment (LSK: Lin-/CD45+/Sca-1+/c-Kit+), Multipotent Progenitors 2 (MPP2: LSK/

 CD48+/CD150+), Multipotent Progenitors 3 and 4 (MPP3/4: LSK/CD48+/CD150-), Short-
term HSC (ST: LSK/CD48-/CD150-) and Long-term HSC (LT: LSK/CD48-/CD150+). 
Mature blood cells were stained with CD19-PB (6D5, BioLegend), Gr-1 APC-Cy7 
(RB6-8C5, eBioscience), CD3-PerCP710 (17A2, eBioscience), and CD11b-APC (M1/70, 
BD). For sorting HSCs, a c-kit+ cell enrichment step was done before staining the cells using 
c-kit Ab-conjugated magnetic beads and MACS separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec). 
Stained cells were re-suspended for final analysis in Hanks Buffered Salt Solution (HBSS) 
with 2% serum (FCS) and 1 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) for dead cell exclusion. Samples 
were analysed on a LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and cell sorting was performed 
using a BD FACS Aria II (BD Biosciences) in the UCSF Flow Cytometry Core. Analysis of 
flow cytometry data was performed using Flowjo (Treestar)
Lung perfusion
Lungs were perfused before lung transplant experiments, FACS, or cell analysis. Mice were 
anesthetized with an i.p. injection of ketamine (50 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). A 20-
gauge angiocath was inserted into the trachea and connected to a ventilator. Through a 
midline abdominal incision the diaphragm was incised circumferentially and 0.1 ml of 
heparin was injected directly into the inferior vena cava. A thoracotomy was performed to 
expose the heart and the lungs. 5 ml of cold PBS with 0.1 ml of heparin solution was 
perfused directly into the right ventricle using a 27 gauge needle. The trachea was then tied 
and the heart–lung block removed and placed in a small tube containing PBS. In selected 
experiments, we also performed retrograde lung perfusion by instilling 5 ml of cold PBS 
with 0.1 ml of heparin solution into the left atrium.
Lung transplant experiments
Left lung transplants in mice were performed as previously described31. Lungs from PF4-
tomato donor or mTmG mice were perfused and the left lung was immediately transplanted 
into C57BL/6 wild-type or c-mpl-/- recipients. Selected c-mpl-/- recipients received 
recombinant human thrombopoietin (rhTPO, Genentech) i.p. (250 mg/kg) at day 3 and day 
40 after transplantation. Blood was collected from the submandibular vein every week to test 
for blood platelet counts, donor derived platelets (tomato+ platelets), and donor derived 
mature blood cells. The transplanted mice were analyzed for 3 months and then euthanized 
for BM, blood, and lung collection and analysis. In selected experiments, mice were aged to 
10 months post-transplantation prior to analysis. For 2PIVM after lung transplantation, a 
mTmG perfused lung was transplanted into a PF4-mTmG recipient or vice-versa. The 
transplanted lung was imaged immediately after transplantation.
Blood collection and platelet counting
For whole blood analysis, blood was withdrawn from the submandibular vein for survival 
bleeding or by cardiac puncture in terminal experiments. Blood was collected into either 
acid citrate dextrose (Sigma-Aldrich) for flow cytometry analysis or EDTA tubes (BD 
microtainer) for platelet counting. Platelet counts in the peripheral blood were measured 
with a Hemavet 950 FS complete blood counting instrument (Drew Scientific) and 
confirmed with manual platelet counts.

 Cell immunofluorescence
Lung MKs—Nucleated cells that were double positive for tomato and CD41 were sorted 
from digested lung and Cytospin slides were prepared. The cells were fixed with PFA 4% 
and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton. After saturation with PBS/BSA 3%, cells were stained 
overnight at 4°C with sheep anti-vWF antibody (Abcam) and 1 hour with anti-Sheep 
AlexaFluor488 antibody (Invitrogen). Slides were mounted with DAPI mounting medium 
(Molecular Probes) and analysed on a Nikon TI-E high-throughput epifluorescence 
microscope (UCSF Nikon Center).
BM cells after lung transplants—BM cells were isolated (see single-cell preparation 
methods) and resuspended in 1mL PBS-EDTA 5mM. 250μL of the suspension was stained 
20 min at room temperature in the dark with 1 μM Syto60 (cell permeant nucleic acid stain) 
and anti CD41-FITC (1μL). Cells were washed, resuspended in PBS, and seeded in 6 wells 
plate for immediate imaging on a Nikon A1R Multi-photon microscope (UCSF BIDC). 
Cells were excited with a 920nm laser for simultaneous excitation of FITC (Green) 
tdTomato (Red) and Syto60 Nucleic acid stain (FarRed).
Platelet activation assay
To determine if the tomato+/CD41+ events detected in the peripheral blood after lung 
transplantation were bona fide platelets, we stimulated whole blood with thrombin (10 nM) 
to induce the expression of P-selectin (RB40.34, BD)32, which was measured by flow 
cytometric analysis and compared to platelets from PF4-tomato mice.
MRSA infection
We used the SF8300 strain of MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, obtained 
from Dr. Chip Chambers at UCSF), which is a minimally-passaged USA300 clinical strain 
representative of the epidemic clone USA300-0114. Stock solutions of SF8300 at the mid-
logarithmic growth phase (1010 CFU/ml) were aliquoted and frozen at -80°C using standard 
techniques. On the day of the experiment, a vial of SF8300 was thawed and diluted with 
PBS to the concentration needed (5 × 107 CFU/mouse in 50 μL) for direct tracheal 
instillation into anesthetized PF4-nTnG mice. Lungs were harvested 24 hours after 
inoculation for single-cell preparation and flow cytometry. To test for vascular localization, 
mice were injected with i.v. CD41–APC (eBioscience), 5 min before lung collection and 
CD41-FITC staining.
RNA-Seq analysis
For RNA-sequencing experiments, we used PF4-nTnG mice and sorted PF4+/CD41+ cells 
from lung and BM prepared for single-cell analysis. For each experiment, 4 mice were 
pooled and cells were sorted directly into lysis buffer. Total mRNA was isolated from 1 × 
104 – 4 × 105 purified cells using a Dynabeads mRNA DIRECT kit (Ambion-Life 
Technologies). Three independent replicates were used for each population. A mRNA 
library was prepared by the UCSF SABRE Functional Genomics Facility using low input 
Nugen Ovation plus Nextera kit (<100 ng RNA) and sequencing was performed using 
Single-end 50bp RNAseq Illumina TruSeq Stranded PolyA library kit and an Illumina HiSeq

 4000 machine. Sequencing yielded ∼432 million total reads with an average read depth of 
72 million reads/sample. Reads were then aligned to the mouse genome (Aligner: 
STAR_2.4.2a aligner, Alignment Genome: Ensembl Mouse GRCm38.78) and genes that 
mapped uniquely to known mRNAs were used to assess differential expression between lung 
and BM groups. Differential expression testing was carried out using DESeq2 v1.14.0.
Using a log ratio test and fold change cutoffs (false discovery rate FDR <0.05), 705 genes 
were found to be differentially expressed: 543 were upregulated by lung MKs and 162 by 
BM MKs. Functional pathways representative of each gene signature were analyzed for 
enrichment in gene categories from the Gene Ontology Biological processes (GO-BP) 
database (Gene Ontology Consortium) using DAVID Bioinformatics Resources. For gene 
signature and each GO category, the significance of the number of overlapping genes in the 
two sets was calculated using a Fisher's exact test performed by the DAVID software. The P-
value resulting from the test reflects the probability of obtaining the observed overlap or 
greater by chance. GO-BP with at least 3 genes and P-value <0.001 were identified.
Statistical analysis
For surface analysis, min-to-max boxplots are represented: the line in the middle of the box 
is plotted at the median, the box extends from the 25th to 75th percentiles and the whiskers 
go down to the smallest value and up to the largest. The + indicates the mean. Other results 
plotted as histograms are reported as mean ± SD and were analyzed by t-test and multi-
group comparisons were performed using a one-way ANOVA test and Bonferroni post-hoc 
test (GraphPad PRISM version 5.0; GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA). In all cases 
where statistical significance is provided, variance was not statistically different between 
groups. Sample sizes were chosen on the basis of previous experience in the lab with respect 
to inherent variability in intravital imaging, lung transplantation, and cellular transplantation 
experiments. There is a 10% surgical failure rate with the mouse orthotopic lung 
transplantation surgery, and it was pre-established that these mice would be excluded from 
the analysis. Animals within each cohort were randomly assigned to treatment groups. 
Blinded analysis was not performed in these studies. P values of less than or equal to 0.05 
were considered to be statistically significant, indicated by ‘*’ in figures, unless otherwise 
noted.

The role of the lung in platelet biogenesis is two-fold and occurs in two different 
compartments. (a) Platelet production in the lung vasculature. After being released from the 
BM or the spleen, proplatelets (a1) and MKs (a2) are retained in the lung vasculature, the 
first capillary bed encountered by any cell leaving the BM, where proplatelet formation and 
extension and final platelet release is observed. (b) Presence of MKs and hematopoietic 
progenitors in the lung interstitium. Mature and immature MKs along with hematopoietic 
progenitors are found in the lung interstitium. In thrombocytopenic environments, 
hematopoietic progenitors from the lung migrate and restore BM hematopoietic deficiencies.
