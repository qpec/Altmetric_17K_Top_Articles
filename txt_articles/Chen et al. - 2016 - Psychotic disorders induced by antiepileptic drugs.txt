Antiepileptic drug treatment can induce psychosis in some patients. However, there are no agreed definitions or diagnostic criteria
for antiepileptic drug-induced psychotic disorder in the classification systems of either epileptology or psychiatry. In this study we
investigated the clinical spectrum of antiepileptic drug-induced psychotic disorder in patients with epilepsy. The medical records of
all patients with epilepsy who were diagnosed by a neuropsychiatrist as having a psychotic disorder at the Royal Melbourne
Hospital from January 1993 to June 2015 were reviewed. Data were extracted regarding epilepsy and its treatment, psychotic
symptoms profile and outcome. The diagnosis of epilepsy was established in accordance to the classification system of the
International League Against Epilepsy while that of psychotic disorder was made according to the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition and the proposal on neuropsychiatric disorders in epilepsy. Patients with antiepileptic
drug-induced psychotic disorder were compared to those with psychotic disorders unrelated to antiepileptic drugs assessed over the
same period (non-antiepileptic drug induced psychotic disorder group). Univariate comparisons were performed and variables with
a value of P 5 0.1 were selected for the multivariate logistic regression analysis. The records of 2630 in-patients and outpatients
with epilepsy were screened, from which 98 (3.7%) with psychotic disorders were identified. Among these, 14 (14.3%) were
diagnosed to have antiepileptic drug-induced psychotic disorder. Excluding one patient who developed psychosis after valproate
withdrawal, 76.9% in the antiepileptic drug induced psychotic disorder group were female and the percentage of temporal lobe
involvement was higher in the antiepileptic drug induced psychotic disorder group (69.2% versus 38.1%, P 5 0.05). Current use of
levetiracetam was higher in antiepileptic drug-induced psychotic disorder group (84.6% versus 20.2%, P 5 0.01) while use of
carbamazepine was higher in the comparator group (15.4% versus 44.0%, P 5 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression confirmed
four factors associated with antiepileptic drug-induced psychotic disorder: female gender, temporal lobe involvement and use of
levetiracetam, and a negative association with carbamazepine. Disorganized behaviours and thinking were more common in the
antiepileptic drug-induced psychotic disorder group (100% versus 72.6% and 76.9% versus 38.1%, respectively; P 5 0.05). The
percentage of continuous treatment with antipsychotic drugs was lower in the antiepileptic drug-induced psychotic disorder group
(15.4% versus 66.7%, P 5 0.01). No patients experienced a chronic course in antiepileptic drug-induced psychotic disorder group
whereas 40.5% did in non-antiepileptic drug induced psychotic disorder (P 5 0.05). Our findings indicated that one in seven
patients with epilepsy who developed psychosis had antiepileptic drug-induced psychotic disorder. In these patients, female gender,
temporal lobe involvement and current use of levetiracetam were significantly associated with antiepileptic drug induced psychotic
disorder compared to other types of psychosis, while carbamazepine had a negative association. Disorganized behaviours and
thinking were predominant in antiepileptic drug-induced psychotic disorder. Patients with antiepileptic drug-induced psychotic
disorder differed from non-antiepileptic drug-induced psychotic disorders in having better outcome.

Introduction
Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders
and ranks as the second leading neurological cause of
reduced
disability-adjusted
life-years
(Murray
et
al.,
2012). Patients with epilepsy have increased vulnerability
to psychiatric co-morbidity including psychotic disorders
(Clarke et al., 2012; Rai et al., 2012), imposing additional
disease burden. For instance, in a Danish population-based
cohort study, the incidence of schizophrenia and schizo-
phrenia-like psychosis in epilepsy patients was nearly 2.5
times and 3 times higher than in the general population,
respectively (Qin et al., 2005).
Among the various types of psychotic disorders in epilepsy,
antiepileptic drug (AED)-induced psychotic disorder (AIPD)
represents an iatrogenic, adverse drug reaction. Prevalence of
AIPD has been reported to range from 1.0% to 8.4% in
clinical trials of AEDs (Piedad et al., 2012). However, de-
tailed analysis of the clinical profile of the psychotic episodes
was lacking in these studies, which tended to rely on screen-
ing questionnaires to ascertain psychiatric symptoms with
few patients undergoing structured interview by psychiatrists
(Clancy et al., 2014). Few studies have reported long-term
outcome of the psychotic episodes, as most randomized trials
reported the psychiatric events within the 12–16 weeks of
observation (de la Loge et al., 2010).
Besides methodological limitations, advances in under-
standing AIDP have been further hampered by the lack of
agreed diagnostic criteria in the existing classification systems
(Lin et al., 2012). Although substance/medication-induced
psychotic disorder is defined in the Fifth Edition of
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM-5), its applicability to AIPD may be questioned because
the pharmacodynamic mechanisms of AEDs may be different
from other substances or medications (American Psychiatric
Association,
2013).
The
International
League
Against
Epilepsy (ILAE) has published a classification scheme for
AED-induced psychiatric disorders, but it is not specific for
psychosis and covers other psychiatric manifestations, such as
affective disorders, that show a different clinical course
(Krishnamoorthy et al., 2007).
As a result of these limitations in knowledge, the man-
agement of AIPD in clinical practice is extremely challen-
ging and not evidence-based. By definition, the definitive
diagnosis of AIPD can only be made retrospectively. In
theory, the most valid way to determine whether a given
AED is responsible in causing a particular adverse event
would be to withdraw the culprit drug and observe the
remission of symptoms, followed by rechallenging with
the medication and observing symptom relapse (Edwards
and Aronson, 2000). This approach, however, is rarely
practical in the clinical epilepsy setting, particularly for psy-
chiatric adverse effects. The diagnosis is further com-
pounded by the predisposition towards AIPD in people
with history of psychiatric illnesses (Trimble et al., 2000;
Weintraub et al., 2007). In some cases the episode of AIPD
can resemble recurrence of previous primary psychotic dis-
order. Therefore, when a patient with epilepsy develops
psychotic symptoms, it is challenging to determine at pres-
entation whether the psychosis is AED induced or not.
Misdiagnosing AIPD as primary psychotic disorder may
lead to inappropriate management, including continuation
of the culprit AED and additional treatment with anti-
psychotic drugs. Often, the psychotic symptoms of AIPD
persist in a fluctuating manner as long as the AED is con-
tinued (Amerincan Psychiatric Association, 2013). The pa-
tient may endure both the adverse effects of the AED and
potential exacerbation of epilepsy by antipsychotic drug
therapy (Lin et al., 2012). Therefore, identification of reli-
able factors at presentation that help to differentiate AIDP
from other forms of psychosis in epilepsy is needed.
In this study we aimed to identify these factors by inves-
tigating the clinical spectrum of AIPD in patients with epi-
lepsy who presented with psychotic symptoms, including
the clinical features of the epilepsy, AED treatment, the
psychotic symptoms and outcome.
Materials and methods
Patient sources
Eligible
patients
were
identified
from
the
Department
of
Neurology at the Royal Melbourne Hospital between January
1993 and June 2015. Patients were mainly identified from those
admitted electively for a comprehensive epilepsy evaluation,
which included prolonged (5 days or more) video EEG moni-
toring, clinical assessment by epileptologists, psychiatric evalu-
ation by neuropsychiatrists, and review of neuroimaging by
neuroradiologists. A minority (7.1%) of patients were identified
from the epilepsy outpatient clinics. All patients had undergone
formal psychiatric interview by a specialist neuropsychiatrist.
The inclusion criteria were: (i) onset of the psychotic dis-
orders at 16 years or older; (ii) diagnosis of epilepsy; and
(iii) admission to hospital or attendance at epilepsy outpatient

 clinic for psychotic symptoms. Patients were excluded if they
had (i) psychogenic non-epileptic seizures; (ii) psychotic symp-
toms as part of the ictal semiology; or (iii) an organic illness
with known psychiatric manifestations, e.g. Wilson’s disease.
Study procedure and diagnostic
approach
The study was approved by the Clinical Research and Ethics
Committee of the Royal Melbourne Hospital (HREC No:
2002.232).
Information
regarding
individual
demographic
data, the clinical manifestations of epilepsy and psychosis, prior
psychiatric history, AED usage, and outcomes of epilepsy and
psychosis was retrieved from the medical records using a
standardized case report form. The data were reviewed by an
epileptologist (Z.C.) and a neuropsychiatry fellow (A.L.) who
jointly confirmed thediagnosis of epilepsy andpsychotic disorder.
Figure 1 illustrates the diagnostic scheme for the various
types of psychotic disorders in relation to epilepsy in the pa-
tients. First, the diagnosis of psychotic disorders was estab-
lished. As per the ILAE proposal (Krishnamoorthy et al.,
2007), psychotic disorders specific to epilepsy were then clas-
sified as psychosis of epilepsy, including interictal psychosis of
epilepsy, postictal psychosis, and AIPD. Psychotic disorders
unrelated to the underlying epilepsy were classified as comor-
bid schizophrenia/schizophreniform disorder. As AIPD was not
specifically defined in the ILAE proposal, its definition was
adopted from the criteria for substance/medication-induced
psychotic disorders in DSM-5, such that if the offending
drug was an AED, the episode was classified as AIPD.
Otherwise it was classified as other substance/medication-
induced psychotic disorder.
Clinical assessments and definitions
According to the classification system of the ILAE, seizures
were classified as generalized or focal. Focal seizures were fur-
ther classified depending on whether there was impairment of
consciousness or evolution to bilateral convulsion (Berg et al.,
2010). Epilepsy syndromes were broadly classified as genetic,
structural/metabolic, and epilepsy of unknown cause. Specific
structural abnormalities of interest were hippocampal sclerosis,
brain tumour and malformations of cortical development.
Temporal lobe involvement was defined as the epileptogenic
lesion locating in temporal lobe with or without the involve-
ment of other lobes. Drug resistance was defined as the failure
of two appropriately chosen and tolerated AED schedules to
maintain seizure freedom (Kwan et al., 2010).
According to the classification system DSM-5, the diagnosis
of psychotic disorders requires the presence of delusions or
hallucinations, plus possible disorganized thinking and grossly
disorganized or abnormal motor behaviour. Either delusions
or hallucinations must be present and the duration of the
psychotic episode must last at least 1 day. Delusions may be
persecutory, referential, somatic, religious, or grandiose delu-
sions. The characteristics of hallucinations, such as auditory,
visual or tactile hallucinations were recorded in the medical
notes. Disorganized thinking was characterized by derailment
or loose associations, tangentiality, incoherence or ‘word
salad’.
Grossly
disorganized
behaviours
reported
in
our
cohort consisted of aggressive behaviour and unusual social
behaviours, such as socially or sexually inappropriate behav-
iours, e.g. talking to oneself in public, obscene language, or
exposing oneself to others.
The relationship of the psychotic disorder to the patient’s
underlying epilepsy were established in accordance with the
proposal by ILAE (Krishnamoorthy et al., 2007). Interictal
psychosis of epilepsy was defined as psychotic episodes in ac-
cordance with the criteria of psychosis in DSM-5 and inde-
pendent from seizures (Table 1). Post-ictal psychosis was
defined as psychotic episodes after a lucid interval (up to
48 h) following a cluster of seizures. Comorbid schizophre-
nia/schizophreniform disorder was diagnosed under DSM-5.
In substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder, either de-
lusions or hallucinations must be present and the psychotic
symptoms develop during or soon after the exposure to a sub-
stance or medication or the withdrawal of that substance. The
severity must impair the patients’ social or occupational func-
tion. When the offending agents were AEDs, the disorder was
classified as AIPD.
For the analysis of outcome, the clinical courses were cate-
gorized as following: (i) a single episode was defined as the
duration of psychosis of longer than 1 day; (ii) a relapse was
defined as recurrent episodes within 1 year after remittance of

 longer than 2 months; and (iii) a chronic course was defined as
duration of the psychotic state of over 1 year without remit-
tance for more than 2 months (Matsuura et al., 2000).
Statistical analysis
Data were presented as n (%) for categorical/qualitative variables
or mean � standard deviation (SD) or median (interquartile
range, IQR) for continuous/quantitative variables. Cases were
patients with AIPD. Controls were the patients with epilepsy
and psychotic disorders unrelated to AEDs assessed over the
same period (non-AIPD group). Clinical variables of epilepsy
and psychotic disorder were compared between the AIPD
group and the non-AIPD group. Univariate comparisons were
performed with t-test, �2 test or Fisher’s exact test, as appropri-
ate. Univariate logistic regression analyses were performed to
calculate the odds ratios of the variables. Variables with
P5 0.1 were selected for multivariate logistic regression analysis.
P5 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Statistical
analyses were carried out using the statistical software package
SPSS 20.0.
Results
Patient characteristics
A total of 98 patients (53 male) with epilepsy who had
experienced psychotic disorders were identified, 22 of
whom had been reported previously (Adams et al., 2008).
Six patients developed psychosis during hospitalization for
video EEG monitoring while the remaining 92 experienced
the psychotic episode at times separate from the monitoring
admission. The median age of onset of epilepsy was 18.5
years (IQR 9–31) and the median age of onset of psychosis
was 34.5 years (IQR 27–45). Seventy-nine (80.6%) patients
had focal onset seizures and 19 (19.4%) had generalized
onset seizures (Table 2). The epilepsy was classified as gen-
etic in 16 (16.3%), structural/metabolic in 59 (60.3%), and
of unknown cause in 23 (23.5%).
The psychosis was classified as AIPD in 14 (14.3%) pa-
tients and unrelated to AED therapy in the other 84
(85.7%). The latter included interictal psychosis of epilepsy
in 33 (33.7%) patients, post-ictal psychosis in 25 (25.5%),
comorbid schizophrenia/schizophreniform disorder in 19
(19.4%), and psychotic disorder induced by substances or
medications other than AEDs in seven (7.1%).
Patients with antiepileptic drug-
induced psychotic disorder
Table 3 shows the clinical features of the 14 patients with
AIPD. The majority (10 of 14) of patients had temporal
lobe involvement in their seizures with a variety of pathol-
ogies. In these patients the most common hallucinations
were auditory and visual. Two patients reported tactile

 hallucinations. The most prevalent type of delusion was
persecutory. Other delusions reported by the patients
included referential, religious, grandiose and somatic. All
patients presented with disorganized behaviours, such as
aggressive and unusual social behaviours. Patient 1 had a
previous history of psychosis induced by an overdose of
weight-loss medication. A similar history was reported by
Patient 4 after taking an antihistamine.
Levetiracetam was the most common AED taken by pa-
tients with AIPD, either as monotherapy or in combination
with other AEDs, accounting for 8 (57.1%) of the 14 cases.
Three (21.4%) were taking lamotrigine. Two (14.3%) pa-
tients experienced two episodes of psychosis associated
with levetiracetam and topiramate separately. One (7.1%)
case was induced by the withdrawal of valproate. The max-
imal dose of levetiracetam used in the AIDP patients varied
from 500 mg/day to 3000 mg/day (median 2000 mg/day).
Notably, relatively low doses (500 to 1000 mg/day) were
used
in
the
four
patients
who
developed
AIPD
on
monotherapy levetiracetam. Among the three cases with
lamotrigine induced AIPD, the maximal doses ranged
from 100 to 600 mg/day. For topiramate, one patient
took 400 mg/day and the other developed psychosis while
taking 150 mg/day.
In 11 patients the psychotic symptoms resolved after
withdrawal of the culprit AEDs. Two patients and one pa-
tient in one of her episodes recovered after reducing the
dosage of the culprit AEDs. The duration of the AIPD epi-
sodes was less than 7 days in nearly half of the patients.
Although eight patients needed treatment with antipsych-
otic drugs to control the psychiatric symptoms, most of
them did not require antipsychotic medication for longer
than 1 month.
Patient 13 of AIPD associated with valproic acid with-
drawal was established in accordance to diagnosis criteria
by ILAE. It is possible this was a primary psychotic dis-
order, which relapsed because of the abrupt withdrawal of
valproic acid therapy. Review of the record showed no
previous history of psychosis in this patient. The time inter-
val of drug withdrawal to onset of psychosis and that of re-
prescription to symptom resolution fulfilled the diagnosis
criteria.
Furthermore,
although
antipsychotic
treatment
with olanzapine was prescribed, the psychotic symptoms
resolved without continuous use of olanzapine. Hence,
this case may be diagnosed as AIPD. As psychosis that
develops after AED withdrawal is conceptually distinct
from that induced by drug initiation or dose escalation,
Patient 13 was excluded from the AIPD group in the fol-
lowing statistical comparisons.
Comparison between antiepileptic
drug-induced and non-antiepileptic
drug-induced psychotic disorder
Epilepsy and treatment related factors
The epilepsy and AED-treatment related factors are listed
in Table 4. There were more females in the AIPD group
(76.9%) compared with the non-AIPD group (41.7%;
P 5 0.05). There was no difference in age of onset of
psychosis between the two groups, nor was there difference
in seizure types.
In the analysis of aetiology classification, AIPD was more
often associated with structural/metabolic epilepsy (84.6%
versus 56.0% in non-AIPD group, P 5 0.05). There was a
trend of higher proportion of patients having brain tumour
in the AIPD group but the difference did not reach statis-
tical significance. In the AIPD group, two patients had cra-
niopharyngioma and one had meningioma. In the non-
AIPD group, there were two patients with astrocytoma
and one with metastasis of ovarian cancer. Tumour type
was unknown in the other two patients. Comparisons of
other common causes, including hippocampal sclerosis,
malformations of cortical development, brain traumatic
injury and cerebral vascular disease, showed no significant
differences.
There was no difference in lateralization of seizure focus
between AIPD and non-AIPD patients. However, the per-
centage of temporal lobe involvement was higher in the
AIPD group [69.2% versus 38.1% in non-AIPD group,
odds ratio (OR) 4.063, P 5 0.05].
Two (15.4%) patients in the AIPD group had a history
of psychiatric disorder prior to epilepsy onset while 24
(28.6%) in the non-AIPD group did. Interestingly, both
cases in the AIPD group were classified as substance/med-
ication-induced psychosis (antihistamine and overdose of
weight-loss medication, respectively) while only two cases
in the non-AIPD group experienced prior substance/medi-
cation induced psychosis (marijuana and steroid, respec-
tively). In the latter group, another two patients had
depression, one had antisocial personality disorder and
the remaining 19 had comorbid schizophrenia/schizophre-
niform disorder. The differences in prior psychiatric history
in general or that specifically related to substance/medica-
tion between the two groups were not statistically signifi-
cant.
Besides
epilepsy
and
psychotic
disorders,
four
(23.1%) patients in the AIPD group had other medical
comorbidities,

in the non-AIPD group, 31 (36.9%) had medical comor-
bidities
including
interstitial
nephritis,
non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma, type 1 diabetes mellitus, asthma and myocar-
dial infarction (OR = 0.722, P = 0.429).
A similar proportion of patients were drug-resistant in
the two groups. However, patients in the AIPD group
had been treated with a greater number of prior AEDs
before the index episode of psychosis, compared to the
non-AIPD group, although the difference was not statistical
[3(IQR: 2–5) versus 2(IQR: 1–3), P = 0.068].
Table 5 lists the AEDs taken by the patients during the
psychotic episodes. In the AIPD group, levetiracetam was
the most commonly used AED, followed by lamotrigine
and valproate. In the non-AIPD group, carbamazepine, val-
proate and phenytoin were most commonly used. Use of
levetiracetam was higher in AIPD group (84.6% versus

Patient 5 experienced the relapse of psychosis 2 years after the episode of AIPD. The relapse was caused by non-compliance of AEDs and her divorce, but no epileptic seizures had been observed before the relapse.
Duration of index psychosis: 1 = 1–7 d; 2 = 8–30 d; 3 = 1–6 m; 4 = 46 m.
Outcome: 1 = a single episode; 2 = a relapse; 3 = a chronic course.

in the non-AIPD group (15.4% versus 44.0%, P 5 0.05).
Eight factors with P 5 0.1 from Tables 4 and 5 were
selected for the multivariate analysis. Multivariate logistic
regression confirmed four factors associated with AIPD:
female gender, temporal lobe involvement and current use
of levetiracetam, and a negative association with carba-
mazepine (Table 6).
Psychiatric manifestations and outcome
Table 7 summarizes the clinical manifestation of psychotic
disorders and the outcome. There were no significant be-
tween-group differences observed with regard to age of
onset of psychoses, or the prevalence of hallucinations or
delusions. Disorganized behaviours and thinking were more
common in the AIPD group compared to non-AIPD group
(100% versus 72.6% and 76.9% versus 64.3%, respect-
ively; P 5 0.05 for both). There were no significant differ-
ences between the groups in co-morbid depressive mood,
anxiety or cognitive function. The duration of psychotic
episodes were less than 1 week in 42.9% of patients in
the AIPD group compared with 22.6% in the non-AIPD
group (P 5 0.05).
Fewer patients with AIPD were treated with antipsychotic
drugs compared with patients with other psychotic dis-
orders (53.8% versus 81.0%, P 5 0.05). Only one patient
with AIPD was treated with more than one antipsychotic
drug. The proportion of patients taking continuous anti-
psychotic treatment was lower in the AIPD group than in
the non-AIPD group (15.4% versus 66.7%, P 5 0.01).

patient experienced a chronic course of psychosis in the
AIPD group while 40.5% did in the non-AIPD group.
Discussion
In this study we report the detailed clinical profiles of AIPD
in comparison with other psychotic disorders in patients
with epilepsy. In a systematic review and meta-analysis,
the pooled prevalence rate for psychosis in epilepsy patients
was 5.6% (Clancy et al., 2014). Although prevalence of
AIPD has been reported to vary from 1.0% to 8.4% in
drug trials (Piedad et al., 2012), the percentage of AIPD
in the population of psychosis in epilepsy has not been
reported before. In this study, among epilepsy patients
with psychotic disorders, one in seven could be attributed
to AEDs. This highlighted the importance of considering
the possibility of AIPD in patient with epilepsy who de-
velops psychotic symptoms.
Antiepileptic drug-induced psychotic
disorder is associated with female
gender and temporal lobe
involvement
Our findings showed that female gender and temporal lobe
involvement were significant risk factors for AEDs-induced
psychotic disorders. More than two-thirds of the patients
with AIPD were female in this study. In previous studies on
the psychiatric side effects of the new AEDs, a similar trend
was reported (Trimble et al., 2000; Mula et al., 2003;
Weintraub et al., 2007).
Results from both univariate and multivariate analyses
demonstrated that temporal lobe involvement was strongly
associated with AIPD. Previous studies showed that the
patients with temporal lobe epilepsy may be susceptible
to develop psychosis (van der Feltz-Cornelis et al., 2008;
Mula and Monaco, 2009). The susceptibility of temporal
lobe epilepsy to AIPD could be linked to the neuro-
anatomical anomalies, such as hippocampal sclerosis and
the underlying abnormal connections to temporal and
extratemporal cortices (Lin et al., 2012). The epileptic aeti-
ology within temporal lobe involvement varied and brain
tumour was one of the risk factors for AIPD in the uni-
variate comparison. The lesions of all three cases with tu-
mours were located at both temporal and other lobes,
which indicated complicated pathological mechanisms of
intra/extratemporal connection for the relation of AED-
induced psychotic disorder and temporal involvement.
The whole cohort with psychotic disorders shared some
mutual epilepsy characteristics, such as focal seizures, cog-
nitive impairment and drug resistance. It has been reported
that a higher ratio of patients suffered from focal seizures
with impairment of awareness than other epileptic seizure
types in the population with psychiatric symptoms (Trimble
et al., 2000; van der Feltz-Cornelis et al., 2008). In our
observation, the percentages of this seizure type in both
groups were higher that 50%, but no significant difference
was demonstrated between them. Hence, focal seizures with
impairment of awareness might be a predictor of psychi-
atric comorbidity but not specifically that of AED-induced
psychosis.
Similarly, cognitive impairment has been reported to be
related to psychosis in patients with epilepsy (Noguchi
et al., 2012). In our study nearly half the patients had in-
tellectual disability but no statistically significant difference
was found between the AIPD group and the comparator
group. This suggests that intellectual dysfunction might be
associated with psychosis in epilepsy in general but not
with AED-induced psychosis.
Both groups had high percentage of drug resistance, an
observation noted in previous reports. A population-based
study
in
male
adolescents
reported
that
treatment-
refractory epilepsy increased the risk of psychotic disorders
(Fruchter et al., 2014). We further analysed the AEDs used
before the episodes of psychosis. The development of
psychosis during the treatment with the culprit AED was
associated with a higher number of previous AEDs used.
This finding was perhaps not surprising given that the more
AEDs were trialled to control seizures in patients with
drug-resistant epilepsy, the higher the possibility of de-
veloping psychiatric adverse effects. However, this factor
was not significant as an independent variable contributing
to the development of AIPD in the multivariate logistic re-
gression analysis.
Patients with a history of febrile convulsions (Mula et al.,
2003, 2007) and status epilepticus (Mula et al., 2004)
might be more vulnerable to develop psychiatric adverse
effects, as suggested in post-marketing studies of levetirace-
tam. In our study, neither the history of febrile convulsions
nor status epilepticus was a predictor of AIPD.
Association with specific
antiepileptic drugs
In the multivariate logistic regression, levetiracetam was
more commonly used among patients with AIDP compared
to those with other types of psychosis. Levetiracetam tar-
gets the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein SV2A and presynaptic
calcium channels (Shorvon and van Rijckevorsel, 2002;
Lynch et al., 2004). Previous studies concerning levetirace-
tam-induced psychotic adverse effects were contradictory
(Mula et al., 2003; Noguchi et al., 2012). Many clinical
trials of levetiracetam reported behaviour adverse effects,
such as irritability, aggressive behaviour in both children
and adults. However, patients in these studies were often
not assessed by psychiatrists (Glauser et al., 2006; de la
Loge et al., 2010). By analysing a cohort of patients who
had developed psychosis, our findings suggest that when a
patient with epilepsy presents with psychotic symptoms,

 current usage of levetiracetam should raise the strong sus-
picion of AIPD.
Interestingly, logistic regression analysis demonstrated
that the current use of carbamazepine was negatively asso-
ciated with AIPD, compared with other types of psychosis,
an observation reported by others (Piedad et al., 2012). No
literature has reported carbamazepine-induced psychosis,
although possible psychotropic effects of carbamazepine,
such
as
anxiety
(Berg
et
al.,
1993)
or
depression
(Pulliainen and Jokelainen, 1995), have long been recog-
nized. Indeed, carbamazepine has been shown to reduce
aggressive behavioural symptoms (Jones et al., 2011).
Hence, in case of AIDP, carbamazepine might be a safe
substitution for the offending agent.
Antiepileptic drug-induced psychotic
disorder characterized by disorga-
nized behaviour and thought
In the proposal by ILAE, clinical features of psychotic dis-
orders in epilepsy may include auditory hallucination and/
or paranoid delusions (Krishnamoorthy et al., 2007). In
DSM-5, the diagnostic criteria of substance/medication-
induced psychotic disorder consist of delusions and hallu-
cinations. Disorganized speech and grossly disorganized
behaviour are the diagnostic criteria of brief psychotic dis-
order but not specifically of substance/medication-induced
psychotic disorder.
We reviewed all the four categories of symptoms in both
groups and found no differences about the two core symp-
toms of psychotic disorders, i.e. hallucinations or delusions.
However, the AIPD group showed higher occurrence of
grossly disorganized behaviours and disorganized thinking
compared with the non-AIPD group. This is consistent with
previous reports of high incidence of aggression, agitation
or irritability with certain AEDs, such as 2.7–24.4% with
topiramate (Elterman et al., 1999; Mula and Trimble,
2003; Weintraub et al., 2007), 2.3–12.5% with levetirace-
tam (Mula et al., 2003; de la Loge et al., 2010), and 1.3–
6.1% with lamotrigine (Weintraub et al., 2007; Labiner
et al., 2009). In contrast, the prevalence of psychosis was
relatively low, as 1.5–6.3% with topiramate (Mula and
Trimble,
2003),
1.0–1.3%
with
levetiracetam
(Mula
et al., 2003; Weintraub et al., 2007) and 0.4% with lamo-
trigine (Weintraub et al., 2007). Therefore, in case of
psychosis with prominent abnormal behaviours in patients
with epilepsy, AIPD should be taken into consideration.
Disorganized thinking was seldom reported in previous stu-
dies. In a European multicentre parallel-group double-blind
trial of zonisamide as add-on treatment, the presence of
disorganized thinking was statistically significant compared
with placebo (Schmidt et al., 1993). Hence the presence of
disorganized thinking or speech should raise the suspicion
of AIPD.
Follow-up observation showed that AIPD had a generally
better outcome than that of the other epileptic psychoses.
Theoretically, AIPD should improve after the cessation of
the culprit medication; hence, if treated properly, the cases
with AIPD might have shorter duration of the psychotic
episode than other types of psychosis. Furthermore none
of the AIPD cases experienced chronic psychiatric course.
For the cases with recurrent course, the main cause was
resumption of the same or similarly acting culprit drugs.
Therefore, the timely cessation of the offending drug and
avoidance of prescription again would offer protection
against further AIPD.
The limitations of this study included a relatively small
sample size and its retrospective design without randomiza-
tion or blinding. As such, it is possible that certain AEDs
might have been preferentially chosen or not chosen in
patients with prior psychiatric history. Patients were as-
sessed by different epileptologists and psychiatrists. To min-
imize the heterogeneity in evaluation for the present study,
the clinical information was jointly reviewed by a single
epileptologist (Z.C.) and a neuropsychiatrist (A.L.) using
a standardized approach, based on the combination of
medical notes and clinic letters, to arrive at the final
diagnosis.
Future research may seek to identify genetic predictors of
psychosis in epilepsy (Helmstaedter et al., 2013). In this
study, the psychotic symptoms induced were not associated
with high dose or fast titration of the offending agents,
suggesting that there was individual susceptibility in terms
of AIPD. Therefore investigation of genetic markers of
AIPD should be the considered for the future studies.
Conclusion
AIPD was common among epilepsy patients who develop
psychotic symptoms. In our study one in seven patients
with epilepsy who presented with psychosis had AIPD. In
these patients, female gender, temporal lobe involvement
and current use of levetiracetam were significantly asso-
ciated with AIPD compared to other types of psychosis,
while
carbamazepine
had
a
negative
association.
Disorganized behaviours and abnormal disorganized think-
ing were predominant symptoms of AIPD. AIPD had an
overall better outcome than that of other psychotic dis-
orders in people with epilepsy.
