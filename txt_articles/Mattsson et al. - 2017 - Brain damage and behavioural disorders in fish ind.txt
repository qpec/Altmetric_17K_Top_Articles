food chain

The tremendous increases in production of plastic materials has led to an accumulation of plastic 
pollution worldwide. Many studies have addressed the physical effects of large-sized plastics on 
organisms, whereas few have focused on plastic nanoparticles, despite their distinct chemical, physical 
and mechanical properties. Hence our understanding of their effects on ecosystem function, behaviour 
and metabolism of organisms remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that plastic nanoparticles reduce 
survival of aquatic zooplankton and penetrate the blood-to-brain barrier in fish and cause behavioural 
disorders. Hence, for the first time, we uncover direct interactions between plastic nanoparticles 
and brain tissue, which is the likely mechanism behind the observed behavioural disorders in the top 
consumer. In a broader perspective, our findings demonstrate that plastic nanoparticles are transferred 
up through a food chain, enter the brain of the top consumer and affect its behaviour, thereby severely 
disrupting the function of natural ecosystems.
The production of plastic material has increased tremendously during the last decades1, 2, and about 10% of the 
plastics produced annually end up in the oceans3 through sewage treatment plants, waste handling or aerial 
deposition4, constituting 60–80% of the total marine debris5. Plastic debris has been shown to affect over 660 
marine species6 through entanglement and ingestion, and is thus a severe and potent pollutant in aquatic envi-
ronments6. Once in the aquatic environment, plastic material breaks up into smaller pieces through the action 
of sunlight, waves, living organisms in the water and by the water itself 
7, 8. Eventually plastic material is broken 
down to nanoparticles9–12, which may be an even more potent threat since plastic nanoparticles are able to pass 
through biological barriers13, penetrate tissues14 and accumulate in organs15 and affect behaviour and metabolism 
of organisms16, 17. Those effects are generally not due to the toxicity of the material per se, but rather a result of the 
physical features of the nanoparticles. Hence, the particle size plays a pivotal role for their biological impact18 as 
size affects the curvature and provide a large surface area18, 19. Smaller particles are generally more toxic than the 
corresponding bulk material at the same mass concentration20–22, and the mobility, biological fate and bioavaila-
bility depend on size, shape, charge and other nanoparticle properties23, 24.
The freshwater invertebrate Daphnia magna can ingest nano- and micro-sized (20 nm to 70 μ
m) particles from 
water21, 25–27, are commonly used in toxicity studies28 and has a pivotal role in many food chains16, 17, 29. Previous 
work has shown that the uptake rate depends on particles size25, 30, 31 and charge32. For example, Daphnia magna 
were shown to have a lower uptake rate of 20 nm than 1000 nm polystyrene particles, although when compared at 
equivalent surface area, the uptake was equal or higher for the small particles. Furthermore, indirect intake rate 
via algal food was higher than direct intake from water30. The precise manner in which particle size, charge and 
surface area affect the intake and biological impact of nanoparticles is, however, still unknown.
Here we report novel findings on how plastic nanoparticles strongly affect an aquatic food chain from the 
zooplankter Daphnia magna to the top consumer, the freshwater fish, Crucian carp (Carassius carassius), which is 
common in anthropogenically affected waters. We exposed Daphnia magna to a range of polymeric nanoparticles

directly in water or via algae (Scendesmus sp.). We show that positively charged amino modified polystyrene nan-
oparticles affect both Daphnia and top consumer (fish) in a size dependent manner. We also show that the nano-
particles were transferred through a three-level food chain from algae through zooplankton to fish, which showed 
behavioural disorders. Moreover, those behavioural disorders depended on the size of the nanoparticles and anal-
yses by hyperspectral microscopy showed that the plastic nanoparticles were present in the fish brains. Hence, we 
here, for the first time, demonstrate the mechanistic chain from uptake of nanoplastic particles by algae, through 
transport up the food chain and, finally, effects on the brain physiology and behaviour of top consumer (fish). On 
a broader scale such effects are likely to considerably affect natural ecosystems, since top predators have a crucial 
impact on lower trophic levels and ecosystem functions33.
Results
Effects on Daphnia magna. 
Out of the tested nanoparticles of different size and charge (Table 1) only ami-
no-modified positively charged polystyrene nanoparticles with a diameter of 52 nm affected Daphnia, whereas 
larger particles of the same material (120–330 nm) had no effect on the animals and we therefore focused on this 
particle size in our study. For the 52 nm particles, the toxicity was strongly dependent on the particle concentra-
tion. Up to a concentration of 0.025 g/L all Daphnia were still alive after 24 hours, and above 0.075 g/L all were 
dead within 13 h (Fig. 1). Comparing the toxicity of differently sized amino-modified polystyrene nanoparticles, 
where either the mass, surface area or the number of particles were the same, revealed that size was the only 
important factor for toxicity. To rule out a potential batch dependent toxicity of 52 nm amino modified polysty-
rene particles, the same type of particles but in a size of 53 nm, 57 nm as well as 58 nm were also tested.
Equipped with the insight obtained from Daphnia magna, we next set out to study the effects of plastic nan-
oparticles (53 nm and 180 nm) on the entire food chain and if the effects of nanoparticles are transferred to the 
fish in a food chain starting from algae (Fig. 2). Analyses of fish feeding times – the time it took for each group 
(aquarium) to consume 50% of the provided Daphnia – showed that the fish receiving 53 nm particles ate more 
slowly than the control fish. Contrary to our expectations, fish fed with 180 nm particles were the fastest feeders 
(Fig. 3A; p < 0.030 ANOVA). Furthermore, detailed analyses of the hunting behaviour showed that the fish fed 
with 53 nm particles swam a longer distance to eat 50% of the provided zooplankton (Fig. 3B, p < 0.02 ANOVA), 
and explored less space within each aquarium (Figs 3C and S1). They also had a significantly lower activity (px/s), 
in contrast to the fish fed 180 nm particles which instead showed a higher activity than controls (Fig. 3D; p < 0.001 
ANOVA). In natural systems, a slower feeding rate combined with a longer swimming distance before successful 
feeding likely leads to suboptimal energy use and a more pronounced exposure to predation. Collectively, these 
consequences point to considerable effects on fitness and thereby on ecosystem function for fish exposed to plas-
tic nanoparticles of about 50 nm size.

feeders and had the highest activity.

The observed behavioural changes in the fish suggest that their brains were affected by the particles. To confirm 
this, we explored the unique spectral features of tracking polystyrene using a CytoViva Hyperspectral Imaging 
System to obtain a wavelength spectrum from each pixel of the light scattered from fish brains. Polystyrene was 
detected in the brains from all analysed fish fed with polystyrene nanoparticles, whereas no polystyrene was 
detected in brains from control fish (Figs 4B and S2).
We also found that fish exposed to nanoparticles had a higher weight loss and less water in their brains than 
control fish (Fig. S3). Moreover, the microscope imaging shows that the gyri in the cerebral lobes were larger in 
fish exposed to 53 nm particles (Fig. 4A; p < 0.025 ANOVA), suggesting also morphological effects from those 
particles. Hence, the morphological changes in the brains of the 53-nm-sized nanoparticle-fed fish suggest that 
fish brains were directly affected by the plastic nanoparticles and that the effects depended on particle size. Taken 
together, our results suggest that some of the plastic nanoparticles fed to fish through a food web end up in the fish 
brains. Furthermore, we unravel a mechanistic link between behavioural disorders and the incorporation of nan-
oparticles in brain tissue.
Discussion
The amount of plastics in the world’s water bodies is rapidly increasing and this material degrades in size over 
time and will eventually break down into plastic nanoparticles. Due to their small size, they easily enter the basis 
of natural food chains, although it is unclear how these particles affect aquatic ecosystems. We show here that 
52 nm positively charged amino modified polystyrene nanoparticles are toxic to Daphnia and that fish feeding 
on Daphnia containing plastic nanoparticles change their behaviour in terms of activity, feeding time and the 
distance they need to swim to consume their provided food. Furthermore, the behavioural changes depend on 
the size of the particles. However, fish receiving 180 nm particles were differently affected as they were the fastest 
feeders and had the highest activity. In nature, the particles likely become aggregated with biological or inorganic 
material, but we here show that the nano-size effect remains after passing through the Daphnia digestive system. 
For example, Ward et al.34 exposed the blue mussel Mytilus edulis and the oyster Crassostrea virginica to poly-
styrene nanoparticles, aggregated nanoparticles and micro-particles and found a higher ingestion rate for the 
aggregated nanoparticles34. Wegner et al.35 exposed the mussel Mytilus edulis to polystyrene nanoparticles both 
as nano-sized particles and as aggregated polystyrene nanoparticles. They found a reduced filtering rate and an 
increased production of pseudofeces35. In this context, our results point to an acute need for a deeper understand-
ing of the size-dependent toxicity effects of nanoparticles when released into nature. How these particles affect 
organisms higher up in the food web, such as fish, as well as how they affect birds and mammals are unclear. In

2015, the estimated amount of plastics being released into the ocean was between 4.8 and 12.7 million tons, with a 
steady increase the coming years36. Eventually this plastic will degrade in size and reach the nanometer size range.
Here we demonstrate how plastic nanoparticles are transported up the food chain and are detected in brain 
tissue of the fish top consumer whereas no polystyrene were detected in the control group. Moreover, we also 
here report macroscopic changes in the brain structure and water content in fish that have received plastic nano-
particles. By using hyperspectral microscopy, we were able to detect polystyrene particles in fish brain tissue and 
thereby we have, for the first time, demonstrated that the plastics nanoparticles can be transported across the 
blood-brain barrier in fish. Moreover, this result suggests a mechanistic link between the observed behavioural 
changes and the presence of plastic nanoparticles in the brain tissue. In the present study, we observed changes in 
the brain which may have been caused by specific interactions between the plastics and the brain tissue, although 
we cannot rule out that other organs may also be affected. Our study lasted for two months, but during the first 
half of the experiment we observed no changes in behaviour of the nanoparticle fed fish, suggesting that fish are 
affected by the particles that are accumulated in the fish. In nature, the Daphnia and fish are likely exposed to low 
concentrations of plastic nanoparticles during their whole life-time, which allows accumulation processes to act 
for a much longer time period than in our study, since fish, such as crucian carp, may live for more than 10 years37. 
However, our results also imply that effects on biota from plastic nanoplastics are dependent on both concentra-
tion and size of the particles, which opens up for manufacturers to adjust production of nanoparticles to sizes that 
are less hazardous to organism metabolism and thereby ecosystem function.
The main conclusion from our study is that plastic nanoparticles are transferred through three tropic levels, 
suggesting that they are likely to be transferred even further up the food web to ultimately reach humans, the 
top-level consumer. Hence, in a broader perspective, our results may have implications for human wellbeing, 
although such consequences of the accelerating disposal rate of plastics is yet not well recognized or understood.
Materials and Methods
Testing for suitable particles with Daphnia magna. 
Polystyrene particles with different surface mod-
ifications, charges, sizes (25 nm to 330 nm) and at a range of concentrations (0.005 g/L to 0.150 g/L) were tested 
for toxicity towards Daphnia magna. On day 1, 100 ml algae or water were added to each bottle together with 
particles with different concentrations except for the control bottle, which received only water (Table 1). The 
bottles were then shaken for 2 minutes, and the algae were allowed to ingest the particles for 24 hours. On day 2, 
900 ml water was added to the algae/water together with 10 adult Daphnia magna with an approximate size of 3 
mm. The number of dead Daphnia was counted every hour for 24 hours and the bottles were then gently stirred 
to distribute the algae or water evenly. To rule out a potential batch dependent toxicity of 52 nm amino modified 
polystyrene particles, the same type of particles but in a size of 53 nm, 57 nm as well as 58 nm were also tested.
Nanoparticle preparation and characterization. 
Positively charged amino-modified polystyrene 
(PAO2N) particles with diameters of 52 nm, 53 nm, 57 nm, 58 nm, 120 nm, 180 nm and 330 nm were purchased 
from Bang laboratories (Fisher, IN, USA). The particles were dialyzed with fresh tap water for 24 hours. The 
particle size was measured, to ensure that particles size remained constant during the experiment, with Dynamic 
Light Scattering (DLS) both before and after dialysis, as well as one week after the dialysis. No change in particle 
size was recorded during the study. We chose to not use surface labelled particles since this may affect the surface 
chemistry. Moreover, it is unknown how passage through the digestive systems of Daphnia and especially fish 
might affect the labelling and vice versa.
Fish experiment. 
Two sizes of particles were chosen for the fish experiment, one with the size of 53 nm that was 
shown to affect the Daphnia and one larger, 180 nm, that did not show any toxicity towards Daphnia. The particle 
size were confirmed with DLS and measured 56 nm (PI: 27%) and 174 nm (PI: 18%) in the water used during the 
experiment. Twenty-four aquaria with three fish in each were divided into four groups. The first group (the 180 nm 
group) received 180 nm particles at a concentration of 0.1 g/L. The second group received the same mass concentra-
tion (0.1 g/L) of 53 nm particles (the 53 nm mass group). The third group also received 53 nm particles, but at a lower 
concentration corresponding to the same surface area as the group receiving 180 nm particles (the 53 nm surface 
area group, concentration 0.029 g/L). The results from this treatment are, for clarity, presented in Supplementary 
material, (Table S1). The fourth group, the control group, did not receive any nanoparticles. All fish were measured 
and weight before the experiment started. The study was performed under the permission from the Malmö/Lund 
Ethical committee (D nr 14 13–12) and was performed according to the current laws in Sweden.
Food chain. 
Algae (Scenedesmus sp.) with a diameter of approximately 25 μ
m were cultivated in aquaria. On 
day 1, 500 mL algae with a concentration of 450 µ
g L
/  were mixed with water and particles to a total volume of 1 L 
in four different test bottles (except for the control bottle, which received only water). After 24 hours Daphnia 
magna (20 Daphnia/fish) were added to the algae medium. After 2 hours, the Daphnia were collected on a net 
with a mesh size of 150 µ
m and washed two times with 150 mL water. Each fish (Crucian carp, Carassius carassius) 
was then served 20 Daphnia, i.e. 60 Daphnia per aquarium.
We replicated this natural food chain such that the fish eventually ingested, via algae and Daphnia, the same 
type of amino-modified polystyrene nanoparticles as used for the Daphnia toxicity with diameters of 53 nm and 
180 nm (Fig. 2). To distinguish between size and mass effects, two concentrations of the 53 nm particles were 
used, one that corresponded to the same surface area and one that corresponded to the same mass as the 180 nm 
particles. The three groups: 180 nm, 53 nm surface area (Table S1) and 53 nm mass were studied together with the 
control group, that did not receive any nanoparticles. Sixty Daphnia individuals were introduced as food to each 
fish aquarium every third day for a period of 67 days.

Video analysis. 
On day 62, we monitored the hunting behaviour of the fish by video recording each aquar-
ium separately during 2 minutes before the fish received food and 10 minutes after. Since the smaller particles 
were toxic to the Daphnia and thereby possibly affected their interaction with the fish, all groups of fish were on 
the 62nd day fed with Daphnia that had not received any nanoparticles. Each fish position was registered each sec-
ond during the whole tracking period using the software ImageJ. The feeding time – the time it took for the fish to 
consume 50% of the provided food (Daphnia) – was registered. An ANOVA post hoc was used to test differences 
between treatments.
Brain analysis. 
On day 64, all fish were collected and anaesthetized using benzocaine. They were measured 
and weighed before the neck was cut and the brain was extracted. All samples were stored at −
80 °C. The brain 
was weighed and an image was recorded with Olympus SZX7 microscope with an Infinity 1 camera and then 
freeze-dried and weighed again before it was homogenized in PBS buffer. The area of two gyri in all brain images 
was measured in pixels2 using ImageJ and further calculated with Matlab. Finally, three brains from each group 
were analysed with CytoViva hyperspectral microscope. This microscope was equipped with an enhanced dark-
field illuminator and visible-near infrared (400–1000 nm) hyperspectral imaging components. The homogenized 
brain samples were imaged under 60x magnification. Each image captured one pixel line at a time using an 
automated stage. These pixel lines were compiled to form hyperspectral images, also known as datacubes, which 
contain spatial and spectral data for each pixel. For each image of exposed brain that was acquired, a spectral 
library corresponding to polystyrene was created. This was accomplished by gathering several regions of interest 
from each exposed brain image and filtering the spectra associated with those regions against 3 negative control 
images (homogenized brain with no polystyrene). Any spectra that matched spectra in the negative controls were 
eliminated from the polystyrene spectral libraries. Then, the polystyrene was spectrally mapped and identified in 
the exposed brain images using the Spectral Angle Mapper algorithm.
