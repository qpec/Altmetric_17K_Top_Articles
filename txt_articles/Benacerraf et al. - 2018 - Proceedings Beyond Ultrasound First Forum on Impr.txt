The Beyond Ultrasound First Forum was conceived to increase awareness that
the quality of obstetric and gynecologic ultrasound can be improved, and is
inconsistent throughout the country, likely due to multiple factors, including the
lack of a standardized curriculum and competency assessment in ultrasound
teaching. The forum brought together representatives from many professional
associations; the imaging community including radiology, obstetrics and gynecol-
ogy, and emergency medicine among others; in addition to government agencies,
insurers, industry, and others with common interest in obstetric and gynecologic
ultrasound. This group worked together in focus sessions aimed at developing
solutions on how to standardize and improve ultrasound training at the resident
level and beyond. A new curriculum and competency assessment program for
teaching residents (obstetrics and gynecology, radiology, and any other specialty
doing obstetrics and gynecology ultrasound) was presented, and performance
measures of ultrasound quality in clinical practice were discussed. The aim of
this forum was to increase and unify the quality of ultrasound examinations in
obstetrics and gynecology with the ultimate goal of improving patient safety and
quality of clinical care. This report describes the proceedings of this conference
including possible approaches to resident teaching and means to improve the
inconsistent quality of ultrasound examinations performed today.

Introduction
B
eyond Ultrasound First is an initiative that focuses on improv-
ing the quality and standardization of ultrasound in obstetrics
and gynecology (Ob/Gyn) to ensure that the full potential of
ultrasound is achieved in clinical practice. While most Ob/Gyn clini-
cal providers agree that ultrasound should be the first line of imaging
for their patients, the use of ultrasound as a first-choice imaging
modality has remained quite variable throughout the country, prob-
ably related to suboptimal training and competency of some ultra-
sound providers and variable quality of ultrasound throughout the
country. The improvement in performance of practitioners who are
trained to measure the nuchal translucency vs those who do not have

SPECIAL COMMUNICATION
 the additional training is only 1 example of the variability
of ultrasound skills.1,2 Ultrasound is unique in that image
acquisition is not standardized like computed tomogra-
phy (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), so
obtaining a high-quality and informative image requires
substantial expertise in image acquisition, a skill tradi-
tionally acquired over several years through an appren-
ticeship with an expert. Ultrasound is one of the few
imaging modalities (noninvasive) that requires a skilled
professional to obtain 1 image at a time by the bedside.
CT and MRI are automated and the images are pro-
duced by the scanner in a standard way. There are stand-
ards for the content of ultrasound examination, but
those standards may be applied by different physicians
with variable skill sets. Data for this are available from
the simulation literature.3,4
There is currently lack of consistency in ultrasound
training and competency assessment in residency pro-
grams in North America.5–7 The Beyond Ultrasound
First Forum was intended to develop solutions on how
to standardize and improve ultrasound training, and to
introduce competency assessment tools and perform-
ance measures of ultrasound in clinical practice. The aim
is to raise and unify the quality of ultrasound examina-
tions in Ob/Gyn with the ultimate goal of improving
patient safety and quality of clinical care. Misinterpreta-
tion, missing a diagnosis, or false-positive findings exem-
plify some of the ways that poor ultrasound training can
harm the population.
This report presents the proceedings of the Beyond
Ultrasound First Forum. In this forum, a variety of experts
provided data and opinions regarding the current quality
and training of Ob/Gyn ultrasound in residency pro-
grams and proposed solutions to enhance education and
competency assessment in the performance and interpre-
tation of ultrasound examinations. This forum brought
together many of the delegates and parties interested in
improving ultrasound education and competency of ultra-
sound throughout the country. These include representa-
tives from many professional associations; the imaging
community including radiology, Ob/Gyn, and others;
government agencies; insurers; industry; and others with
common interest in ultrasound in Ob/Gyn.
The Problem
Stating the current problem in ultrasound training and
competency assessment is an important first step
towards developing strategies to improve the quality of
Ob/Gyn ultrasound in clinical practice. The scope of the
forum was thus divided into 3 parts: quality and training
in Ob/Gyn ultrasound, ultrasound as first modality in
Ob/Gyn imaging, and the payer’s perspectives.
Quality and Training in Ob/Gyn Ultrasound
What Is the Current Quality of Obstetric
Ultrasound in Clinical Practice?
Performing obstetrical ultrasound is fundamentally uni-
que and difficult because of the complexity of fetal anat-
omy and the challenges posed by fetal movement and
maternal body habitus. This is compounded by the
operator dependency that is inherent in performing an
ultrasound examination. These factors contribute to vari-
ability in exam quality. Objective analysis is further com-
pounded by the diversity of venues where ultrasound is
performed, and the substantial variability in training of
personnel performing and interpreting obstetric ultra-
sound. Finally, the data are difficult to analyze because
the majority, if not all, of pregnant women today are
offered standard obstetrical scans to rule out major
anomalies, and the incidence of congenital anomalies is
very low in the general population. With the risk of con-
genital anomalies at 3% to 4%, the ultrasound operator
can be correct > 95% of the time without even turning
the ultrasound machine on!
Quality of obstetrical ultrasound relates to 2
important issues: (1) completeness of the study in
accordance with existing practice parameters, and (2)
acquisition of diagnostic-quality images accompanied
by timely and accurate interpretation of these images.
Unfortunately, the detection rates for fetal anomalies
varies between 13.3% to 82.4% with the higher rate
being from Europe.8,9
There is evidence that the quality of obstetric ultra-
sound is highly variable and on occasions, suboptimal. In
2004, Abuhamad et al7 studied the American Institute of
Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM) Ultrasound Practice
Accreditation Program and its impact on the quality of
ultrasound in obstetrical practices. A review of cases sub-
mitted to the AIUM found that 40% of practices seeking
initial accreditation from 2001 through 2004 were oper-
ating below the existing national guidelines for the per-
formance of the ultrasound exam.7 This statistic is even
more concerning considering that practices voluntarily
seeking accreditation had the opportunity to send their
best cases for review.
With regards to the accuracy of ultrasound diag-
noses, a study from Children’s Hospital of Nevada (at
Benacerraf et al—Beyond Ultrasound First Forum
8
J Ultrasound Med 2018; 37:7–18
 University Medical Center) explored the sensitivity of
obstetrical ultrasound for detecting congenital heart dis-
ease. In Clark County, Nevada, there were 161 major
congenital heart defects out of 77,000 births from 2003
through 2006 (prevalence 2/1000). Only 36% of these
cardiac abnormalities were detected on prenatal ultra-
sound. Several studies from other centers corroborate
these findings and indicate that cardiac and other subtle
malformations are consistently missed prenatally.10
Others have also studied the role of education and train-
ing to improve the quality of ultrasound examinations
using methods such as accreditation and score-based
methods.11–13
Can Quality in Ultrasound Be Improved?
Anecdotal reports and expert opinions suggest that the
quality of Ob/Gyn ultrasound can be substantially
improved. In a study on ultrasound practices seeking
accreditation by the AIUM, ultrasound practices seeking
reaccreditation showed significant improvement in com-
pliance with established Ob/Gyn ultrasound practice
parameters compared to initial accreditation, with signifi-
cantly improved scores on case reviews.7
A 2015 study14 demonstrated encouraging results
of a locally instituted quality improvement initiative on
sonographer performance. Thirteen sonographers in an
ultrasound unit were mandated to complete an elec-
tronically embedded checklist based on quality criteria
as established by national guidelines. The sonographers
were charged with checking off each parameter in-
cluded in the checklist after every scan they performed,
and their charts were reviewed quarterly to determine
compliance. On baseline assessment, a wide quality dis-
tribution appeared across the group, from scores as
high as 88% to as low as 0% compliance, with an aver-
age across all sonographers of 49% of exams performed
correctly. Over the next 4 quarters of using the check-
lists, the average degree of compliance rose steadily,
with 97% of exams meeting the quality criteria by the
end of the fourth quarter and with every sonographer
showing improvement.14
Another study from the Netherlands provides fur-
ther evidence of the value of monitoring to improve
sonographer performance. In 2007 the Netherlands
instituted a uniform nationwide screening program for
detection of fetal anomalies. The program required that
sonographers performing the screening ultrasound scans
pass theoretical and practical examinations, and then
maintain caseloads of> 150 ultrasound scans per year.
A surveillance committee performed quality assurance
assessments every 2 years. Before introduction of the
screening program, the total detection rate of congenital
heart disease in the Netherlands was < 36%, and 80% of
isolated cases of congenital heart disease were missed.
After introducing the screening program, prenatal detec-
tion improved from 22.8% to 44.2% for detection of iso-
lated congenital heart disease.15
Similarly, data from the National Nuchal Translu-
cency Education and Quality Monitoring Program indi-
cate that training a cohort of physicians and sonographers
on how to perform ultrasound scans optimally, and track-
ing quality over time, improves performance.16
Similarly, there is evidence that gynecologic ultra-
sound also needs to be taught in more detail, for exam-
ple, the more training practitioners have, the better they
are able to characterize an adnexal mass as benign or
malignant using ultrasound.17,18
These data show that we can improve the quality of
ultrasound by standardizing the exam, complying with
existing guidelines, and implementing an ongoing over-
sight and quality review for individuals performing and
interpreting the scans.
What Is the Current Status of Ultrasound
Training in Residency Programs?
As residency programs in Ob/Gyn and radiology have
had to add more breadth of training in their curricula,
the time spent learning ultrasound has diminished in
many programs. A survey of Ob/Gyn residents, per-
formed in 2003 by the Council on Resident Education
in Obstetrics and Gynecology (CREOG), reported that
didactic ultrasound training and required rotations in
ultrasound occurred in 64% and 41% of residency pro-
grams, respectively.6,19 The survey also noted that only
16% of programs required residents to perform and
interpret ultrasound during their training.6,19
An independent survey of Ob/Gyn residency pro-
grams confirmed the findings of the CREOG survey and
noted that ultrasound training competency assessment is
subjective in most programs.6 Existing data also suggest
that the majority (73%) of radiology residents re-
ceive < 4 weeks of training in obstetrical imaging per
year.20 In a recent survey of 233 practicing physicians
who were asked whether the current level of residency
ultrasound training in Canada is meeting their practice
needs, confidence in the performance and interpretation
Benacerraf et al—Beyond Ultrasound First Forum

9
 of a pelvic ultrasound examination was reported
in< 60% of respondents.5 When asked about the ade-
quacy of current ultrasound training,< 25% of residents
reported feeling confident in their ability to perform pel-
vic ultrasound scans upon completion of training pro-
grams,
and < 35%
felt
confident
in
interpreting
ultrasound examinations. Adequate knowledge on how
to find and use output display standards for safety of
obstetric ultrasound practice is reported in only 13%
among Ob/Gyn residents and in 20% of maternal-fetal
medicine fellows.21
How Many Ultrasound Procedures Must Residents
Perform to Become Competent?
Currently there are insufficient data on the number of
ultrasound procedures required for a physician to
become competent in performing or interpreting sonog-
raphy. A study at the department of radiology at Duke
University School of Medicine assessed residents’ pro-
gression towards ultrasound competency.22 After initial
ultrasound rotations and training, residents were re-
quired to acquire and interpret their images independ-
ently. At each increment of 10 examinations, the faculty
evaluated the progress using a standardized checklist.
They found that as the number of cases acquired by the
residents in postgraduate year 1 increased, their quality
improved. But despite an upward trend, even after 200
cases, anatomic landmarks were detectable in only 56%
of cases. The residents missed > 40% of anatomic land-
marks, and only 16% of their cases met the criteria to
pass. The most common cause of failure in early training
was missing abnormalities, as the inexperienced pra-
ctitioner had difficulty distinguishing abnormal from
normal anatomy. These authors concluded that involve-
ment in � 200 cases during the training program is
insufficient to develop acceptable level of competency in
sonography.23
A majority of ultrasound competency benchmarks
use a designated number of ultrasound examinations
performed as a competency indicator. A deeper exami-
nation of ultrasound assessment, and more broadly, psy-
chomotor skill acquisition, reveals using an absolute
number of examinations is an imprecise predictor of
competency. Variations in learning curves between ultra-
sound learners, including baseline declarative knowledge,
intrinsic psychomotor skill, and complexity of an ultra-
sound examination, result in broad and yet ill-defined
competency parameters.
The AIUM sets the threshold at 300 ultrasound
examinations performed during residency for physicians
to qualify for accreditation without additional training.
Although the number was chosen arbitrarily, it reflects
an experience-based consensus.24 The number of ultra-
sound examinations performed today in residency pro-
grams falls well short of the 300, or even the 200,
examinations. In 2016, based on Ob/Gyn residents’ self-
reported data to the Accreditation Council for Graduate
Medical Education (ACGME), the median number of
obstetric ultrasound examinations performed > 4 years
of residency was 94, with 235 examinations performed
at the 90th percentile level. The median number of
transvaginal ultrasound scans performed was 70, and the
90th percentile level was 144.25 The minimum number
of obstetric and transvaginal ultrasound examinations in
a 4-year Ob/Gyn residency program per ACGME is 50
for each category.25 With regard to the radiology resi-
dencies, ACGME does not distinguish between types of
ultrasound, but they mandate 350 abdomen and/or pel-
vic ultrasound scans during 4 years of residency training.
Why Should Ultrasound Be Considered
as the First (and Often Only) Diagnostic
Modality for Imaging in Ob/Gyn?
Ultrasound is the most effective and accurate modality
for imaging the female pelvis as it combines advanced
imaging that is performed in real time, is relatively inex-
pensive, and has the ability to localize sources of pelvic
pain and discomfort along with the mobility of pelvic
organs. Additionally, ultrasound can qualitatively and
quantitatively assess vascularity of tissue using Doppler
imaging techniques, without the need for contrast. Ultra-
sound is well tolerated by women and does not result in
radiation exposure.
Ultrasound is also key for the evaluation of the
infertile patient. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstructed
views of the uterus provide clear images of the endome-
trial cavity and the outer contour of the uterus, thus pro-
viding an excellent method of detecting m€
ullerian duct
anomalies. Introducing saline into the uterine cavity
through a small catheter provides important information
about the endometrium, outlining any intracavitary
lesions such as submucosal fibroids or polyps. The pat-
ency of the tubes is easily evaluated by introducing a
small amount of air or contrast into the cavity while
scanning in real time to demonstrate tubal patency.
Benacerraf et al—Beyond Ultrasound First Forum

J Ultrasound Med 2018; 37:7–18
 Despite these clear advantages, many women who
present with pelvic pain and masses still undergo CT
scans first, and suspected m€
ullerian duct abnormalities
are still typically evaluated first by MRI. In fact, the reim-
bursement for m€
ullerian duct abnormalities exists only
for MRI, and not for 3D ultrasound, despite the fact that
the coronal view of the uterus reconstructed from a 3D
ultrasound volume provides excellent and reliable diag-
nostic images of congenital uterine anomalies and can
provide all the necessary imaging information.
CT and MRI are obviously easier to perform
because they are automated examinations that provide
very rapid, standardized volume scans without the need
for the practitioner to be present during the examina-
tion. However, CT and MRI often yield confusing find-
ings in the pelvis that require clarification by ultrasound.
Ordering these unnecessary studies is wasteful and
expensive, and the radiation risk of CT is substantial and
often underestimated. According to a study by Berring-
ton de Gonz�
alez et al26 in 2009, an estimated 29,000
future cancers could be related to CT of the pelvis and
abdomen done in the United States in 2007. The largest
contribution to this projected risk of cancer (14,000 can-
cers) was attributed to CT of the pelvis and abdomen.26
There is evidence that more CT is performed on gyne-
cologic patients with pelvic pain than is necessary.27–29
Asch et al28 show that 22% of women receiving a CT
first actually would have benefitted from an ultrasound
and did not require a CT.
The Payers’ Perspectives: Why Is Ultrasound
Not Ordered as First Imaging Modality?
Information provided from the payers during the
forum report that insurance management companies
encourage diagnostic facilities to seek accreditation.
Compliance with accreditation for facilities providing
MRI and CT is very high since it is commonly neces-
sary for reimbursements. However, ultrasound facili-
ties, especially private offices, are less compliant with
accreditation since it is not currently mandatory. This
lack of accreditation may have contributed to the wide
degree of quality with ultrasound imaging. Patients
referred for a second opinion regarding an abnormal
finding on ultrasound are often found to actually have
normal findings, resulting in expensive false-positive
diagnoses and unnecessary patient worry.
Many ultrasound reports offer a tentative diagnosis,
but end by recommending “MRI for further evaluation”
and therein is the real problem for ultrasound reimbur-
sement. Benefits managers appropriately recommend
ultrasound as the initial imaging procedure for many
conditions when they receive requests for the authoriza-
tion of MRI and CT procedures. In experienced hands,
ultrasound is invaluable and provides a diagnostic answer
in most cases without the need for further testing al-
though occasionally MRI can helpful. For example, the
value of ultrasound in musculoskeletal imaging is well
established. There is, however, currently lack of wide-
spread physician expertise in this field and, as a result,
future recommendations for utilization and reimburse-
ment may be disadvantaged. If we continue as a profes-
sion to end so many ultrasound reports with “MRI is
recommended” or “CT is recommended,” requesting
physicians and payers may become disenchanted with
ultrasound as a modality, thus decreasing its value.
Consequently, we need to work together to provide
adequate training and maintenance of competency to
ensure that all ultrasound procedures are performed
with high quality resulting in confident diagnoses.
Solutions
Novel Techniques for Ultrasound Training
and Competency Assessment
The combination of simulated teaching and live ins-
truction makes it possible to teach ultrasound to many
students; however, it is far more challenging to assess
students’ competency and proficiency, which is a critical
part of education.
Medical technology has evolved rapidly, from the
200-year-old stethoscope to today’s ultrasound equip-
ment that fits into the palm of your hand. Technologies
have enabled all care providers to have a tool in their
hand allowing the clinicians to see inside the body when
examining a patient. Limitations are not technical any-
more, but the practice of medicine seems slow to change
and to integrate new techniques into the daily workflow.
Technical innovations are only as good as the
people who are implementing them, so overcoming edu-
cational barriers is essential. Within the educational pro-
cess, students need guidance and assessments, and must
be able to reach mastery for every condition where com-
petency and proficiency are expected. The residents of
the millennial generation are being taught differently.
Traditional academic modalities are being replaced or
augmented by new approaches, such as SonoGames
Benacerraf et al—Beyond Ultrasound First Forum
J Ultrasound Med 2018; 37:7–18
11
 (Academy of Emergency Ultrasound, Des Plaines, IL)
where residents are taught or assessed on real-time psy-
chomotor skills. Students are trained to interpret images
or apply clinical decision-making through a series of
nontraditional methods.
When laparoscopic surgery first emerged, inad-
equate training and lack of competency assessment re-
sulted in high complication rates of procedures such as
laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Ultrasound requires simi-
lar hand-eye coordination. Predictably, the rate of lapa-
roscopic complications was unacceptable to the medical
community and their patients. Fortunately, private in-
dustry and membership organizations were able to work
together to develop guidelines, and practitioners were
required to clear a certain bar of competency before
they could actually perform laparoscopic surgery. Today,
the complication rates for laparoscopic cholecystectomy
mirror those for open cholecystectomy and have be-
come the standard of care.30,31
So how does ultrasound avoid the problems that
beset laparoscopic surgery in its early days? Proper educa-
tion and competency assessment is essential. Competency
assessment must test 2 types of knowledge: declarative
(the ability to describe how a task is done) and procedural
(the ability to actually perform the task). Declarative
knowledge is acquired largely through didactic instruction.
Procedural knowledge is the aspect of competency that
relies on psychomotor skills. Psychomotor skills can be
categorized as “open” or “closed” skills, depending on
level of complexity. Closed skills are used to perform
static tasks–for example, to obtain a sonographic image of
a stationary structure. Open skills are those required for
dynamic tasks in an unpredictable setting, such as captur-
ing biometry of a moving fetus in the second trimester.
Visuomotor and visuospatial aptitudes are essential
to ultrasound performance skills. Visuomotor skills relate
to the ability to coordinate movement in synchrony with
visual input. In ultrasound, this is the skill set called
upon for manipulating a transducer into a useful sono-
graphic window. Visuospatial skills are used to reason
out and conceptualize spatial relationships. This is the
skill that enables one to mentally reconstruct a 3D envi-
ronment from 2-dimensional image slices, or to guide an
instrument to a target position.
Students can be taught to attain a certain level of
mastery, but without reinforcement, or frequent use, the
skill will decay below what is considered competency.
With refresher training, however, the student can regain
competency. In addition to learning how to perform an
ultrasound, students must learn to integrate the imaging
into medical decision-making. For example, how confi-
dent is the student that the ultrasound has adequately
answered the clinical question without the need to order
a CT scan or rely on MRI?
Looking into the future, researchers are experiment-
ing with computer-based technology for highly efficient
competency assessment. Using transducers with embed-
ded motion sensors, they are analyzing the hand move-
ments of experts as they acquire an image, and then
comparing the movements of novices doing the same
task. Using computer-based technology, they can app-
roximate when learners achieve expert status. This is crit-
ically important because computer-based assessments
can test the proficiency of a large group of students with-
out having a 1-on-1 assessment by sonographers or
sonologists for each student. We may soon be able to
develop and refine computer-based automated assess-
ment programs to test psychomotor skills needed to per-
form ultrasound. Importantly, these tools can provide
learners who are underperforming with direct feedback
on how to improve.3,4,32 While there is no short cut or
easy way to train residents and finding the time to add
more ultrasound to the already crammed residency pro-
gram is difficult, it is outside the scope of this forum. We
need to start by acknowledging that there is a problem
and strive to enhance the ultrasound training.
The Role of Accreditation
Quality and Standardization
AIUM accreditation is a voluntary peer-review process
that allows practices and clinics to demonstrate that
they can meet or exceed nationally recognized stand-
ards for the performance and interpretation of basic
Ob/Gyn ultrasound as specified in the AIUM and
American College of Radiology (ACR) joint guide-
lines. The most valuable aspect of accreditation is
actually the process a practice goes through because it
encourages providers to assess their strengths, evalu-
ate their weaknesses, and initiate changes to improve
their practice performance.7,24 Based on available data
from AIUM and ACR, approximately 37% of ultra-
sound practices in the United States are accredited by
either organization. These data indicate that much
work remains to be done to raise this number.
The AIUM looks at a variety of quality indicators
when accrediting a practice. These include provider
Benacerraf et al—Beyond Ultrasound First Forum
12
J Ultrasound Med 2018; 37:7–18
 education, training, and experience, and confirmation
that a provider is able to practice in compliance with the
most recent practice parameter and imaging protocols
for the examinations being performed. Retaining appro-
priate images as well as providing reports that are com-
plete, timely, and in accordance with documentation
parameters is an important part of the review process.
The
Ultrasound
Practice
Accreditation
Council
(UPAC) of the AIUM also evaluates practices’ policies
and procedures for safeguarding patients and personnel,
and for proper maintenance of equipment.
The accreditation process is key to improving qual-
ity in ultrasound. Accreditation promotes self-reflection.
It prompts practices to assess the education and training
of their members, and to review their current scanning
protocols. It also promotes increased awareness of their
internal quality assurance protocols. Reviewers assess
submitted case studies for completion, accuracy, image
quality, and compliance with as low as reasonably achiev-
able. Educational feedback is provided to answer ques-
tions and to encourage practices to comply with the
parameters and other accreditation guidelines.
Setting Standards
The AIUM sets many standards that serve as the foun-
dation for the AIUM accreditation program. This is a
collaborative effort with multiple professional specialty
organizations, aimed at promoting the safe and effective
use of ultrasound in patient care.
The UPAC has developed 12 clinician postresi-
dency training guidelines, including 3 for obstetrics and
1 for gynecology. Since obstetrical residencies and fel-
lowships may not provide adequate structured training,
these guidelines were developed by consensus of experi-
enced individuals to set benchmarks for adequate train-
ing attained after formal education. For example, to
meet obstetric training requirements, the AIUM requires
50 American Medical Association category 1TM credits
dedicated to diagnostic obstetrical ultrasound, plus evi-
dence of having performed 300 diagnostic obstetrical
ultrasound examinations within 3 years under the super-
vision of a qualified provider. Similar guidelines are in
place for gynecology.
Accredited practices are expected to comply with
the most recent practice parameters and protocols in
the specific area of practice. The AIUM currently
publishes 31 practice parameters, including 7 that
relate to performance of the examinations in Ob/Gyn
(Table 1). These parameters are produced in colla-
boration with multiple other professional societies
(Table 2).
Looking into the future, adequate training, compe-
tency assessment, as well as ultrasound accreditation
should be strongly encouraged and even required to
ensure compliance with existing national guidelines.
Finally, as medicine in the United States evolves towards
integrating more advanced clinical providers, practice
parameters need to be modified to encompass the entire
scope of practice.

 Raising the Level of Quality of Ultrasound
in a Large Health System
The Northwell Health Ultrasound Task Force has re-
cently undertaken a program to improve patient care
through standardization of ultrasound practice. This
program is a systemwide quality and safety initiative
to promote the use of ultrasound at the highest level
through adequate training, assessment of competency,
and credentialing. The need for standardization grew
as the clinical use of ultrasound expanded rapidly
throughout the health system. A review of ultrasound
practice revealed that the scope of ultrasound applica-
tion, level of training, practitioner experience, and
image quality were extremely variable. This task force
recently reached out to the AIUM to explore opportu-
nities for systemwide accreditation.
The ultrasound task force appointed by Northwell
recognized that credentialing and accreditation are clearly
linked to patient safety and quality. In addition, accredita-
tion is already mandated by many insurance companies
and required by the Joint Commission (accreditation,
health care certification). Hence, they aim to make accredi-
tation mandatory for their entire health care system utiliz-
ing national standards and accrediting bodies including
AIUM, Intersocietal Accreditation Commission, ACR,
American College of Cardiology, and American College of
Emergency Physicians. They also recognized the need for
new pathways for ultrasound accreditation for those serv-
ice lines that do not currently have ultrasound privileging
and credentialing programs. These pathways are currently
under development for each individual area. This process
will incorporate training guidelines, standardized protocols,
equipment maintenance, ongoing education, quality assur-
ance, and peer review as well as report documentation and
image storage and retrieval. The task force reviewed and
updated the delineation of privileges for each department,
with the appropriate ultrasound applications for each
group, and is currently evaluating educational opportuni-
ties for those who want to perform these studies.
The Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine opened
Aug. 1, 2011, and developed a 4-year longitudinal ultra-
sound curriculum for the medical school. A multidiscipli-
nary faculty provides didactic lectures and hands-on
instruction, and the integration is tied into the students’
anatomy, physiology, and physical exam classes as well
as clinical rotations. Tools include simulation, hands-on
classes, and electives, as well as robust student assess-
ment. It is the expectation that ultrasound in medical
education will serve to improve ultrasound practice for
all service lines and develop a generation of practitioners
with consistent high-quality standards.
Discussion Groups
Group 1: Discussion on Implementation
of Education in Residency Training,
Including Training the Trainers
Successful Models of Resident Education:
What Do We Need to Know?
The following implementation strategies suggested by
the panel:
Ultrasound must be incorporated into the currently
required didactic time to promote implementation
of the curriculum at a local level. Training pro-
grams may consider initiation of Ob/Gyn ultra-
sound training sooner than currently planned, even
into the medical school curriculum, by offering a
fourth-year Ob/Gyn imaging rotation to interested
students. Using ultrasound as a tool for teaching
during medical school could play a very important
role in teaching and promoting ultrasound.
Residency program directors need to be involved in
the broader-based integration of the curriculum into
residency training. Those responsible for implemen-
tation are best equipped to identify specific barriers
and ways to overcome them in their programs.
National organizations involved in residency training,
such as CREOG, can take a leading role in providing
support to residency program directors and in mar-
keting and disseminating the curriculum, competency
assessment tools, and lecture series. Looking at other
other parts of the world such as Europe, there are
several initiatives with specific curricula that resemble
the one proposed here. The best known one is from
the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics
and Gynecology–they cover both basic and advanced
Ob/Gyn ultrasound.33,34
Group 2: How to Maintain Competency Over
Time–Benchmarks and Mechanisms
to Track Competency
Proposed Methods to Assess Competency in Ultrasound
The panel considered a variety of methods to assess
competency, including the use of simulation, direct
observation of exam performance, and conducting image
review to provide individual feedback. It is imperative to
evaluate quality of scan performance, interpretation, and
frequency of additional confirmatory studies needed.

 Dedicated time for quality assurance and case
reviews is paramount for monitoring skill level on an
ongoing basis. Professionalism should also be assessed,
given the importance of patient satisfaction, and ability
to interact with patients and staff. Practice accreditation
is a fundamentally important tool for promoting and
measuring competency. Outcome measures should serve
as benchmarks and goals for improvement and there
should be a plan for remediation for those who need it.
Time required to do competency assessment must be
protected. This is challenging due to the number of new
competency requirements that are superimposed on
already busy administrative and clinical workflow and
can collectively contribute to physician burnout.
The panel emphasized the importance of financial
considerations for implementing these programs in the
context of their limited budgets. Cost is a major barrier
to implementing changes, but if the appropriate out-
come metrics are identified and demonstrate an impact
on patient safety, the hospital or institution will be more
likely to provide support. In addition, the cost for con-
tinuing education, including conferences, needs to be
subsidized. Webinars and live streaming educational
activities can reduce costs.
It is essential to identify an upper-level champion
in the department who will foster goals and keep the
staff and learners on task, whether it be a physician,
sonographer, or administrator. To effectively imple-
ment a quality improvement program and competency
assessment, patient caseloads for faculty, residents, and
sonographers must be adequately controlled. An appro-
priately equipped room that is partially or entirely dedi-
cated for ultrasound training would also be very helpful
towards accomplishing these goals.
The panel affirmed that industry should be actively
involved with quality improvement efforts. Industry
should consider developing smart tools/innovations
providing software capable of automatically recognizing
normal and abnormal fetal anatomy by an analysis of
image scoring criteria, possibly through a form of artifi-
cial intelligence. Software that quantifies knowledge,
psychomotor tasks (eg, rocking, sliding, rolling), and
image interpretation would be a valuable tool for char-
acterizing the difference between novice and expert,
specific to practice specialty.
Finally, the group agreed that competency criteria
or proficiency testing strategies being considered must
be linked to improved clinical care and outcomes based
on evidence-based results. Clear definition and charac-
terization
of
meaningful
outcome
measures
are
extremely important for this purpose. Meeting this goal
would rely on development of outcome-based guidelines
for individual competencies. A possible strategy might
be for the AIUM Clinical Standards Committee to for-
malize outcomes benchmarks as an integral part of each
new practice guideline or guideline revision. In con-
clusion, the panel summarized that important areas to
consider include defining the scope of practice, dev-
elopment of meaningful competency metrics, accredita-
tion, and remediation.
Group 3: How Do We Ensure Compliance
With Beyond Ultrasound First?
The use of ultrasound can be considered in 3 different
settings: (1) outpatient, (2) emergency department, and
(3) inpatient. Pressures vary in each of those circumstan-
ces. For example, time constraints associated with inpa-
tient and emergency care may make CT more attractive.
Emergency department patients must be treated or
admitted within 2 hours in most institutions, and there
is pressure to discharge inpatients as soon as possible. In
addition, CT technologists are almost always in-house,
but sonographers are more often unavailable or taking
calls from home after hours. Limitations to availability of
sonographers as well as physicians adequately trained to
perform and interpret ultrasound examination may be
limited in some settings, not only in the hospital and
emergency departments, but also in rural areas and dif-
ferent parts of the country.
Medical-legal issues are an ongoing, significant pro-
blem for clinicians. Often, physicians will order a CT
scan to confirm ultrasound findings as a way to “spread
the risk.” In other cases, surgeons are unwilling to oper-
ate for some indications, like appendicitis, on the basis of
ultrasound findings alone, so physicians are compelled
to order a CT scan even when ultrasound is sufficient to
make a diagnosis.
Some of these issues may be addressed through
more rigorous sets of evidence-based guidelines and
benchmark data. International Classification of Diseases
codes may help to assess whether requesting physicians
are using ultrasound appropriately or ordering advanced
imaging procedures for a condition that could be imaged
with ultrasound first, or how often they follow ultra-
sound with another imaging procedures. A robust deliv-
ery system, such as computerized order entry or
Benacerraf et al—Beyond Ultrasound First Forum
J Ultrasound Med 2018; 37:7–18
15
 electronic decision support, could provide requesting
practitioners immediate access to the information they
need to order ultrasound appropriately. From early in
their training, physicians who order imaging studies
need to be educated to recognize when ultrasound first
is appropriate. Even physicians in specialties not cur-
rently using ultrasound should be educated about how
they might incorporate ultrasound into their practice to
improve patient care.
Peer benchmarking is widely used among primary
care physicians to determine their ordering patterns for
advanced cross-sectional imaging. Bar graphs of physi-
cians in their own practices can demonstrate the pattern
of use, resulting in pressure to change the practice of
outliers. Conceivably, the same approach could be
applied to ordering of ultrasound first. In the absence of
good data on the current use of ultrasound first or ultra-
sound only in the community, it is difficult to pinpoint a
standard, and it also will vary from practice to practice.
Peer benchmarking is useful to determine whether ultra-
sound is or is not being ordered first.
Finally, the group discussed ways in which quality
can be raised and enforced given that the variable profi-
ciency of ultrasound practitioners likely contributes to
the reluctance of referring physicians to order ultrasound
first. Ultrasound reports should be evaluated to deter-
mine how often the final reading recommended CT or
MRI. Studies suggest that accreditation enhances quality
assurance for individuals who are performing and inter-
preting ultrasound scans, however, requiring accredita-
tion is controversial. Applying for accreditation may be a
burden for some practices, especially emergency prac-
tices where there are limited options, but some bench-
mark or measure is necessary to demonstrate that good-
quality studies are being performed. In some specialties,
there may be a trade-off between the quality aspects of
accreditation and access issues; for example, requiring or
pressing for accreditation may improve quality, but there
may be fewer practices or physicians who can provide
the service.
Group 4: Expanding the Use
of Ultrasound–New Horizons
Education
Education was a recurring theme for much of the discus-
sion about how to expand or focus the use of ultrasound.
Training more practitioners in focused or subspecialty
use of ultrasound would improve patient throughput
and workflow. Practitioners need training and familiarity
with the equipment such as knowledge of their systems’
capabilities and proper use. Manufacturers should play
an important role in education by using standardized ter-
minology so that once an operator knows how to use
one system, he or she can use another system. Early edu-
cation is key to promoting the use of ultrasound. As pre-
viously discussed, medical school is an opportunity to
foster familiarity with the equipment and imaging funda-
mentals.35,36 When medical students are taught ultra-
sound instrumentation and care of the equipment
during medical school, they are better equipped to focus
the use of ultrasound when they transition into graduate
medical training.
Equipment Improvements and New Capabilities
The second aspect of the discussion explored the impor-
tance of working with manufacturers to promote ease of
equipment use for clinicians. Computer-aided point-
and-image technology, with features such as auto-focus,
auto-optimize, and auto-Doppler, could remove an initial
barrier to high-quality imaging. Many of these features
are actually already present on many machines, but not
necessarily straightforward for the user to access. Users
typically only utilize a fraction of the technology avail-
able in the ultrasound equipment.
Advanced ultrasound technology will play a critical
role in making ultrasound a user-friendly imaging modal-
ity. With the push of a button, volume flow technology
would calculate blood volume and rate of flow automati-
cally. Wireless transducers would eliminate cord con-
straints, making it easier to scan patients in confined
quarters, such as in intensive care units and labor and
delivery rooms. Robotic systems provide even greater
accessibility. By enabling remote control of the trans-
ducer, robotic systems allow operators to acquire scan
information and assist during surgery without entering
the operating room.
To further improve quality through standardization,
the group discussed the use of computer assistance to
guide ultrasound imaging. For example, if an algorithm
is applied to fetal measurements as they are being
acquired, and an abnormal measurement is detected, the
computer could prompt the sonographer to investigate
other structures based on the algorithm. For example, a
short femur could prompt measurements of all the long
bones. Computer-aided examination guidance has been
investigated in echocardiography and shows promise.
Benacerraf et al—Beyond Ultrasound First Forum

J Ultrasound Med 2018; 37:7–18
 Currently available protocol-driven exams promote
completeness of studies, but they could be even more
useful if the system could assess adequacy of acquired
images, and automatically check off components of the
exam as they are completed. Machine learning could be
incorporated, so that the ultrasound system would learn
what series of steps sonographers take repeatedly and
automate those steps. Taking computer assistance fur-
ther, computer image analysis could identify normal ana-
tomical features and then automatically check them off
the list. For example, in an acceptable view of an abdom-
inal circumference, the stomach and the abdominal vein
coming off the portal vein could be identified by the
computer and marked as complete. Lastly, ultrasound
machines will need continued improvement in image
storage, retrieval, and reconstruction of volumetric ultra-
sound data.
Forum Summary and Conclusions
There was consensus around the fact that ultrasound is
a valuable imaging technology that allows for cost-
effective diagnosis of various pathologies in all human
organs. It is relatively inexpensive, portable, and safe
when used appropriately. In skilled hands, ultrasound
performs equally, if not better than, CT and MRI, in a
number of anatomic regions. Ultrasound does have
some limitations, with the most significant being its
operator dependency, which results in variable quality
across the country. It is important to use multiple
approaches and resources to address this issue, such as
introducing curricula for training and competency
assessment as well as standardizing the approach and
interpretation of the ultrasound examination. This forum
was organized to address all these issues.
One of the most important steps towards improving
ultrasound quality is the development of a curriculum
and competency assessment tools for ultrasound train-
ees. To that effect, the AIUM has put together a multiso-
ciety task force of designated experts in Ob/Gyn,
radiology, and medical education to develop a curricu-
lum and competency evaluation process for ultrasound
training in residency programs. This curriculum is also
applicable to anyone who wants to learn how to perform
Ob/Gyn ultrasound examinations even though they
may have already completed their formal training. The
standardized, consensus-based curriculum and compe-
tency assessment tools of ultrasound training is
presented in detail in Abuhamad et al (submitted). We
do not have the answers regarding how to integrate this
ultrasound teaching into already crammed existing train-
ing programs and this issue is beyond the scope of this
forum, however, it is important to acknowledge the
problem and propose ideas as the first step to making a
change.
To provide didactic teaching, we convened a second
task force to develop a comprehensive series of lectures
covering all aspects of Ob/Gyn ultrasound, from basic
knobology to detailed evaluation of the fetal heart. The
core educational materials are provided by didactic lec-
tures from 32 content experts and the final product will
be freely available didactic resource to learners. This will
prove to be a very important source of ultrasound educa-
tion for program directors of sonography schools and
residency programs and will help to support programs
that do not have local sonologist experts to provide edu-
cational content.
The Beyond Ultrasound First Forum was conceived
to raise awareness that the quality of ultrasound is dis-
parate throughout the country and that there is insuffi-
cient teaching of ultrasound that is diminishing each
year. To reverse this trend, we must work on standardiz-
ing and raising the value of diagnostic ultrasound while
educating the referring physicians about the appropriate
indications for an Ob/Gyn ultrasound. Knowing that
much effort is needed to achieve these laudable goals,
the development of a multisociety consensus-based cur-
riculum along with competency assessment tools and an
accompanying lecture series are major steps forward.
