Background: Conduct problems (CP) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are often comorbid and
have each been linked to ‘unhealthy diet’. Early-life diet also associates with DNA methylation of the insulin-like
growth factor 2 gene (IGF2), involved in fetal and neural development. We investigated the degree to which prenatal
high-fat and -sugar diet might relate to ADHD symptoms via IGF2 DNA methylation for early-onset persistent (EOP)
versus low CP youth. Methods: Participants were 164 youth with EOP (n = 83) versus low (n = 81) CP drawn from the
Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. We assessed if the interrelationships between high-fat and -sugar
diet (prenatal, postnatal), IGF2 methylation (birth and age 7, collected from blood), and ADHD symptoms (age 7–13)
differed for EOP versus low CP youth. Results: Prenatal ‘unhealthy diet’ was positively associated with IGF2
methylation at birth for both the EOP and low CP youth. For EOP only: (a) higher IGF2 methylation predicted ADHD
symptoms; and (b) prenatal ‘unhealthy diet’ was associated with higher ADHD symptoms indirectly via higher IGF2
methylation. Conclusions: Preventing ‘unhealthy diet’ in pregnancy might reduce the risk of ADHD symptoms in
EOP youth via lower offspring IGF2 methylation. Keywords: DNA methylation; Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents
and Children; diet; conduct problems; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; IGF2.
Introduction
Conduct problems (CP) and attention deficit hyper-
activity
disorder
(ADHD)
commonly
co-occur.
Importantly, evidence from family (Faraone, 2000),
twin (Thapar, Harrington, & McGuffin, 2001), and
molecular
genetic
(Holmes
et al.,
2002)
studies
suggest that that this co-occurrence denotes a more
severe, familial, and heritable entity, compared to
either CP or ADHD alone. Children with an early-
onset and persistent pattern of CP represent a
particular at-risk group, as they often show the
highest rates of ADHD (Barker, Oliver, & Maughan,
2010), as well as the greatest levels of psychosocial
risk exposures in pregnancy (e.g. poverty, maternal
anxiety) and the early postnatal years (e.g. harsh
parenting, family discordance) (Barker & Maughan,
2009).
One prenatal risk that is a correlate of these
psychosocial risks, yet has received far less atten-
tion, is diet. ‘Unhealthy diet’ (e.g. high fat/sugar) is of
particular interest as it has been reported to asso-
ciate with both CP and ADHD (Howard et al., 2011;
Jacka et al., 2013; Liu, Raine, Venables, & Mednick,
2004; Sonuga-Barke et al., 2013). A potential mech-
anism that might help explain the link between
‘unhealthy diet’ and CP and ADHD is the epigenetic
process of DNA methylation, which is highly respon-
sive to the nutritional environment (Drake et al.,
2012), and also associates with CP-related pheno-
types
(Cecil
et al.,
2014)
and
ADHD
(Schuch,
Utsumi, Costa, Kulikowski, & Muszkat, 2015; van
Mil et al., 2014; Walton et al., 2016).
Diet has also been shown to influence methylation
of the insulin-like growth factor 2 gene (IGF2) (Hei-
jmans et al., 2008), an imprinted gene that lies close
to the insulin and tyrosine hydroxylase genes in a
genomic region related to the metabolic regulation of
glucose homeostasis, cardiovascular functions, and
lipid metabolism (Faienza et al., 2010; Ukkola, Sun,
& Bouchard, 2001). IGF2 may be of interest to ADHD
as it is a major modulator of placental and fetal
growth (Constancia et al., 2002) and also plays an
integral role in brain development after birth (Pids-
ley, Dempster, Troakes, Al-Sarraj, & Mill, 2012).
Animal and human studies report that IGF2 is
associated with developmental abnormalities in the
structure and/or function of the cerebellum (Pidsley
et al., 2012) and the hippocampus (Chen et al.,
2011;
Ouchi
et al.,
2013),

 associated with ADHD (Castellanos et al., 2002;
Plessen et al., 2006), as well as other psychiatric
disorders such as depression and schizophrenia (Yu,
Shen, Zeng, Ma, & Hu, 2013).
Periconceptional risk exposure is associated with
abnormal brain development (Jensen et al., 2015),
with relevance to CP and ADHD (Fairchild et al.,
2011; Rubia, Smith, Brammer, Toone, & Taylor,
2005). Moreover, diet-induced IGF2 DNA methyla-
tion modifications occur specifically during the peri-
conceptional
period
and
may
persist
well
in
adulthood (Heijmans et al., 2008). Together, these
findings suggest that the long-term impact of early-
life dietary factors on CP and ADHD may, at least in
part, be explained by IGF2 DNA methylation. The
current study simultaneously examined, for early-
onset persistent (EOP) versus low CP youth, the
extent to which unhealthy prenatal and postnatal
diet (high fat, high sugar) is associated with ADHD
symptoms via DNA methylation of IGF2 (birth and
age 7, collected from blood).
Methods
Participants
The
Avon
Longitudinal
Study
of
Parents
and
Children
(ALSPAC) is a prospective study of children born to 14,541
pregnant women residing in Avon, United Kingdom, with an
expected delivery date between April 1, 1991 and December
31, 1992 (85% of eligible population (Fraser et al., 2013)).
When compared with 1991 national census data, the ALSPAC
sample was found to be similar to the UK population as a whole
(Boyd et al., 2013). Ethics approval for the study was obtained
from the ALSPAC Law and Ethics Committee as well as Local
Research Committees. All participants provided informed
consent. The study website contains details of all the data
that are available through a fully searchable data dictionary:
http://www.bris.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/data-access/data-
dictionary/.
This study uses a subsample (n = 346, 50% male) from a
larger study of DNA methylation in ALSPAC, the Accessible
Resource for Integrated Epigenomics Studies (ARIES (Relton
et al., 2015), www.ariesepigenomics.org.uk), which follows
previously established CP trajectories and has epigenetic data
at birth and/or age 7. The CP trajectories, including (a) low
(26.9%), (b) childhood-limited (25.4%), (c) adolescent-onset
(19.7%), and (d) early-onset persistent (28.0%), have been
previously identified and validated (Barker & Maughan, 2009).
Specifically, general mixture modeling was used based on the
‘Conduct Problem’ subscale (4–13 years) of the Strengths and
Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ; (Goodman, 2001). This ‘Epi-
genetic Pathways to Conduct Problems Study’ subsample is
comparable to the full trajectory sample (n = 7,218) in terms of
environmental risk and psychiatric comorbidity (Barker et al.,
2010). DNA methylation data were available for 321 youth at
birth and 326 at age 7.
In light of the objective of this study, and to ensure a feasible
set of statistical analyses, we included youth in the low and
early-onset CP trajectories, who had complete data for prenatal
‘unhealthy diet’, IGF2 DNA methylation at birth and ADHD
symptoms (ntotal = 164; nlow = 81; nEOP = 83). We did not
assess the childhood-limited or adolescent-onset as these
youth have different developmental risk pathways than the
early-onset and low CP youth (see Barker & Maughan, 2009;
Moffitt et al., 2008).
Measures
DNA methylation data.
Five hundred nanograms of
genomic DNA from cord blood (birth) or peripheral blood (age
7) was bisulfite-converted using the EZ-DNA methylation kit
(Zymo Research, Orange, CA). The protocol followed the
manufacturer’s instructions using the recommended alterna-
tive incubation conditions for use with Illumina Infinium
arrays. Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChips (Illumina,
San Diego, CA) were run following the manufacturer’s protocol
with no modifications, and arrays were scanned using an
Illumina iScan (software version 3.3.28). Initial quality control
of data generated was conducted using GenomeStudio (Illu-
mina; version 2011.1) to determine the status of staining,
extension, hybridization, target removal, bisulfite conversion,
specificity,
nonpolymorphic,
and
negative
controls.
DNA
methylation data were only available for samples that passed
this stage. Samples were quantile normalized using the dasen
function within the wateRmelon package (wateRmelon_1.0.3)
(Pidsley et al., 2013) in R and batch-corrected using the
ComBat package (Johnson, Li, & Rabinovic, 2007).
We extracted 139 probes that are mapped to IGF2 or
overlapping regions adjacent to IGF2, including INS-IGF2 (i.e.
position 2150687 to 2183864). For each probe, methylation
levels were indexed by beta values (i.e. the ratio of methylated
signal relative to the sum of the methylated and unmethylated
signals). Factor analysis was used in the total sample to
establish the covariance structure among the 139 IGF2 probes
in order to extract a smaller set of underlying factors, removing
CpGs with low correlations as needed. A three-factor solution
showed the best fit to the data. Full details of the factor
analysis procedure and results are provided as online sup-
porting information (Appendix S1 and Table S1). We present
findings relating specifically to factor 1 (37 probes) because
factor 2 (11 probes) and 3 (5 probes) did not correlate with
‘unhealthy diet’ and ADHD symptoms for the EOP and low CP
trajectory. See Appendix S2 for the location of the IGF2
methylation probes included in this study, and how these are
grouped into factors. See Appendix S3 for the correlations
between the IGF2 methylation probes.
High-fat and -sugar diet.
The Food Frequency Ques-
tionnaire (FFQ; (Micali, Northstone, Emmett, Naumann, &
Treasure, 2012) was used to assess (a) maternal dietary
patterns at 32 weeks of gestation, and (b) what the mother
reported feeding to the child at 3, 4.5, and 7 years of age. The
FFQ contains a set of questions about the frequency of
consumption of a wide variety of food and drink, with higher
scores
indicating
higher
frequency
of
intake.
Possible
responses were: never or rarely; once in 2 weeks, 1–3 times
per week; 4–7 times per week; and more than once daily.
Prenatal and postnatal high-fat and -sugar diet scores, indi-
cated by processed food (i.e. fried food, meat pies or pasties,
chips) and confectionery (i.e. crisps, chocolate bars, cakes or
buns, biscuits) had been previously created using latent
factors (Barker, Kirkham, Ng, & Jensen, 2013). For the current
analyses, we combined the postnatal diet scores across time
(age 3–7) by the use of a latent factor (range factor load-
ings = .74–.84).
Attention

symp-
toms.
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symp-
toms were repeatedly assessed (at age 7, 10, and 13) with the
Development and Well-being Assessment (DAWBA; Goodman,
Ford,
Richards,
Gatward,
&
Meltzer,
2000),
a
validated
semistructured interview. Parents completed open and closed
questions about a range of symptoms relevant to youth
psychiatric disorders, including ADHD, oppositional defiant
disorder (ODD), conduct disorder (CD), generalized anxiety
disorder (GAD), and major depressive disorder (MDD). For each

 disorder, an ordered categorical measure was generated using
computer
algorithms (Goodman,
Heiervang,
Collishaw, &
Goodman, 2011), comprising six categories indicating the
likelihood of each youth having the disorder from level 0 up
to level 5. For the current analyses, we created factor scores
across
time
(age
7–13)
for
ADHD
(range
factor
load-
ings = .73–.81), ODD (range factor loadings = .58–.82), GAD
(range factor loadings = .58–.59), and MDD (range factor
loadings = .37–.72).
Control variables.
We included two types of control
variables; repeated measures of cumulative risk and cell type
distribution. First, cumulative risk variables were summated
into indices spanning two developmental periods (pregnancy
and early-childhood [birth–age 7]) and regressed on all endoge-
nous study variables. For each developmental period, a
cumulative risk index had been previously created using latent
factor analyses (Cecil et al., 2014), based on maternal reports,
covering five risk domains: (a) life events (e.g. death in family,
accident, illness), (b) contextual risks (e.g. poor housing
conditions, financial problems), (c) parental risks (e.g. parental
psychopathology, criminal involvement and substance use), (d)
interpersonal risks (e.g. intimate partner violence, family
conflict), and (e) direct victimization (e.g. child bullied by peers
or physically hurt; available postnatally). We also assessed
maternal smoking during pregnancy, which was measured
during the first trimester of pregnancy via maternal ratings,
using a yes (n = 29)/no (n = 135) binary variable. However,
this variable did not correlate with IGF2 DNA methylation (see
Table 1) and, hence, was not added as a covariate.
Second, we controlled for cell type heterogeneity to estimate
cell proportions using DNA methylation data (Houseman et al.,
2012). Specifically, IGF2 DNA methylation scores were residu-
alized for estimated proportions of cells in whole blood (propor-
tionofCD8+T cells,CD4+T cells,naturalkiller[NK]cells,B cells,
and monocytes). Granulocytes were removed because the cell
type proportions add up to approximately 100%.
Data analysis
The analysis proceeded in three main steps. In the first step, we
tested for developmental interrelationships between ‘unhealthy
nutrition’ and ADHD using a multiple group autoregressive
cross-lagged (ARCL) model. We did so by testing the degree to
which, for EOP versus low CP, the relationship between high-fat
and -sugar diet and IGF2 DNA methylation differed. CP trajec-
tory differences and sex differences were tested in nested model
comparisons using chi-square differencetests.Two modelswere
estimatedinstep 1.Thefirstwasanunadjustedmodel,wherewe
did not control for cumulative risks, and the second was an
adjusted model, where cumulative risks were regressed on
endogenous study variables. In the second step, we tested, for
EOP versus low CP youth, the degree to which prenatal high-fat
and -sugar diet might indirectly relate to higher levels of ADHD
symptoms via IGF2 DNA methylation at birth. This indirect
pathway was programmed in a model constraint statement.
Difference between the EOP and low CP were tested by a
bootstrapped (see below) difference between the respective
indirect pathways (i.e. EOP – Low CP). In the third step, we
examined the extent to which high-fat and -sugar diet and IGF2
DNA methylation are specific risk factors to the development of
ADHD symptoms as opposed to other externalizing (i.e. ODD) or
internalizing disorders (i.e. GAD, MDD). Cell type was controlled
in all models across steps 1, 2, and 3.
Analyses were performed in Mplus version 7.11 (Muth�
en &
Muth�
en, 1998–2013) using maximum likelihood estimation.
Given the small sample size, we used bootstrapped with bias-
corrected 95% confidence intervals (10,000 bootstraps) to
derive variance from the empirical distribution of the observed
data.
Model fit was first established using the chi-square statistic.
Missing data were handled through full information maximum
likelihood. Youth with scores > 3.29 standard deviation from
the mean on any study variable were treated as outliers (n = 3)
and their scores winsorized (i.e. transformed to match next
highest or lowest value).
Results
Descriptive statistics
Table 1 contains the correlations and descriptive
statistics of the study variables. These statistics are
presented separately for the two CP trajectories. Five
results are highlighted. First, in line with previous
research, EOP children showed higher levels of
ADHD symptoms compared to low CP children.
However, means and variances for ADHD differed
from zero for the two groups (EOP and low CP youth;
all p-values < .001). Second, we found that in EOP
but not in low CP youth (a) factor 1 IGF2 mean DNA
methylation at birth was positively correlated with
ADHD symptoms and (b) factor 1 IGF2 DNA methy-
lation at age 7 was negatively correlated with post-
natal cumulative risk. Third, for the EOP youth,
‘unhealthy diet’ correlated at a trend level with IGF2
DNA methylation at birth (r[83] = .20, p = .06) and
ADHD (r[83] = .18, p = .10). Fourth, for EOP and low
CP youth alike, prenatal cumulative risk was highly
correlated with postnatal cumulative risk, but for
EOP only, higher postnatal cumulative risk was
significantly associated with lower IGF2 DNA methy-
lation at age 7. Fifth, early-onset CP youth signifi-
cantly differed from the low CP in ODD, GAD, and
MDD (p < .05); for EOP and low CP youth alike,
prenatal and postnatal IFG2 DNA methylation was
not correlated with ODD, GAD, or MDD.
Step 1: Autoregressive cross-lagged (ARCL) model
predicting ADHD symptoms
The unadjusted and adjusted models did not differ in
terms of significant path coefficients or model com-
parisons. Therefore, we present the adjusted model
only(seeFigureS1fortheunadjustedmodel).Figure 1
depicts the adjusted ARCL model for ‘unhealthy diet’,
IGF2 DNA methylation, and youth ADHD symptoms.

we assessed differences between EOP and low CP

tion. The freely estimated model, which served as the

showed acceptable fit to the data (v2[4] = 6.24,

across the parameters in EOP versus low CP youth
(Dv2
EOP[9] = 4.38, p = .88; Dv2
low[9] = 9.04, p = .43), we
report the results for males and females together.

 Auto-regressions.
The omnibus auto-regressions
nested chi-square test constrained two parameters
(i.e. stability in diet and IGF2 DNA methylation,
respectively). We found temporal stability in diet but
not in IGF2 DNA methylation, and these estimates
did not significantly vary between EOP and low CP
youth (Δv2[2] = 5.96, p = .05), indicating a similar
pattern of auto-regressions across trajectories. This
result is statistically significant.
Cross-lagged associations.
The omnibus nested
chi-square test for the cross-lagged associations
constrained the parameters of diet influencing IGF2
DNA methylation and IGF2 DNA methylation influ-
encing diet. Prenatal diet was associated with IGF2
DNA methylation at birth for both EOP and low
CP youth, and the strength of this association did
not
significantly
differ
between
the
trajectories
(Δv2[3] = 1.98, p = .58).
Prenatal predictions to ADHD symptoms.
The
omnibus nested model chi-square difference test
for the prenatal predictions to ADHD symptoms
constrained two parameters (i.e. predictions from
prenatal diet and IGF2 DNA methylation at birth to
ADHD symptoms) and these varied significantly
between EOP and low CP youth (Δv2[2] = 6.49,
p = .04). Follow-up difference tests showed an inter-
action, where the association between IGF2 DNA
methylation at birth and ADHD symptoms at age 7–
13 years was significantly higher for EOP versus low
CP youth (Δv2[1] = 5.58, p = .02) (see Figure 1). This
is noteworthy given that (a) we had previously shown
no DNA methylation difference between the EOP and
low CP youth (see Table 1) and that (b) the associ-
ation between prenatal ‘unhealthy diet’ and ADHD
symptoms did not significantly differ between EOP
and low CP youth (Δv2[1] = 0.40, p = .53) and was
not significant when averaged across all youth (see
Figure 1).
Postnatal predictions to ADHD symptoms.
The
omnibus nested model chi-square difference test
constrained the parameters of postnatal diet and
IGF2 DNA methylation at age 7 predicting ADHD
symptoms. These associations did not significantly
vary between EOP and low CP youth (Δv2[2] = 1.70,
p = .43) and were not significant when averaged
across all youth.
Step 2: Indirect pathway
For EOP youth, prenatal ‘unhealthy diet’ was indi-
rectly associated with ADHD symptoms via higher
IGF2 DNA methylation at birth. The bias-corrected
confidence interval (via 10,000 bootstraps) for the
indirect pathway of prenatal ‘unhealthy diet’ to
ADHD symptoms via IGF2 DNA methylation at birth
did not cross zero (b = .069; 95% CI .003, .206). For
low CP youth, the 95% CI of this indirect pathway via
IGF2 DNA methylation did cross zero (b = �.015;
95% CI �.086, .019). The indirect pathway was
different between the EOP and low CP youth: the
95% CI of the difference of the indirect pathways did
not cross zero (b = �.084; 95% CI �.224, �.005).
Step 3: Other disorders
In light of the findings above, we repeated the ARCL
model to examine the extent to which the association
of IGF2 DNA methylation was specific to ADHD
symptoms as opposed to other psychiatric disorders
(ODD, GAD, and MDD) for EOP versus low CP youth.

 For EOP and low CP youth, IGF2 DNA methylation
was unrelated to all other disorders (i.e. associations
did not survive bootstrapped confidence intervals).
Discussion
In the present study, we used a longitudinal design
to investigate prospective associations between ‘un-
healthy diet,’ IGF2 DNA methylation, and ADHD
symptoms in EOP versus low CP youth. Our results
showed that prenatal ‘unhealthy diet’ was positively
associated with IGF2 DNA methylation at birth
across both EOP and low CP youth. However, only
for EOP youth, (a) higher IGF2 DNA methylation at
birth predicted ADHD symptoms; and (b) prenatal
‘unhealthy diet’ was associated with higher ADHD
symptoms indirectly via higher IGF2 DNA methyla-
tion at birth.
The present findings showed a statistical interac-
tion, whereby although DNA methylation levels did
not differ between the early-onset and low CP youth,
higher levels of DNA methylation were associated
with higher symptoms of ADHD for the early-onset
but not for the low CP youth. What could be the
reason for this? One could posit that the reason
could lie in symptoms of ADHD – the same associ-
ation would manifest for low CP youth if their levels
of ADHD were the same as those of the early-onset
youth. Another potential explanation could lie in the
biological vulnerability of CP with ADHD (Beau-
chaine, Hinshaw, & Pang, 2010). Indeed, we identi-
fied an indirect effect where higher prenatal intake of
unhealthy fats/sugars associated with increased
ADHD via higher IGF2 DNA methylation, which
may suggest a developmental risk pathway for the
early-onset youth alone. It is important to mention
that this biological vulnerability may be tapped by
other measures of diet (metabolomics) and biology
(HPA axis) that are sensitive to stress (Jones, Park, &
Ziegler, 2012; Reynolds, Godfrey, Barker, Osmond,
& Phillips, 2007).
In this study, we found that for early-onset youth,
higher prenatal ‘unhealthy diet’ was correlated with
higher IGF2 DNA methylation at birth, but higher
postnatal cumulative risk exposure was correlated
with lower IGF2 DNA methylation at age 7. Why
might DNA methylation associate with the environ-
ment differently at birth versus age 7? Findings may
reflect two distinct types of risk exposure (i.e. diet vs.
cumulative risk), which may differentially influence
IGF2 function. On one hand, diet (or prenatal nutri-
tion) has been found to directly affect the metabolic
functions of the gene (Ukkola et al., 2001), showing –
in the present findings – higher offspring methylation
with higher maternal caloric intake, and also lower
methylation in the case of maternal caloric depriva-
tion (Dutch Hunger Winter; Heijmans et al., 2008).
On the other hand, more distal influences, such as
the cumulative risks examined here (e.g. poverty,
family discord), may affect IGF2 DNA methylation
through
stress
response
pathways,
such
as
increased cortisol activity, which has been found to
be associated with lower IGF2 methylation (Vangeel
et al., 2015). Given that maternal (or child) stress
can co-occur with different dietary patterns (Heij-
mans et al., 2008), the effects of cortisol and inflam-
mation (Thorburn, Macia, & Mackay, 2014) on IGF2
methylation may be promising avenues for future
research.
Several limitations should be considered when
interpreting the present results. First, this research
is correlational in nature; hence, causality cannot be
inferred. However, the present research is based on a
longitudinal design, which does allow prospective
assessment of prenatal and postnatal effects on DNA
methylation and can facilitate the use of methods
that can strengthen causal inference (e.g. Mendelian
randomization) (Pingault, Cecil, Murray, Munaf�
o, &
Viding, 2016; Relton & Smith, 2012). Second, the
magnitude of the observed associations was not
large, and necessitates replication in larger epidemi-
ological samples. Third, all measures except DNA
methylation were based on maternal reports. Hence,
the temporal stability of diet may be overestimated.
However, it is unlikely that the magnitude of the
pathways of interest (i.e. prenatal ‘unhealthy diet’ to
IGF2 DNA methylation; IGF2 DNA methylation to
ADHD symptoms) is artificially inflated by shared
method variance. The use of in-depth interviews for
the assessment of ADHD symptoms adds to the
robustness of our findings. Fourth, the present
study did not identify sex differences in the associ-
ation between IFG2 methylation and ADHD. Sex
differences are nevertheless a promising avenue for
future investigation given that boys are generally
higher in externalizing problems (such as CP and
ADHD). Fifth, the IGF2 locus is a complex genomic
region that produces multiple transcripts from alter-
native promoters, serves different biological func-
tions, and is differentially expressed in different
tissues and at different developmental periods. This
gene may also shift from monoallelic to biallelic IGF2
promoter methylation
during development (Issa,
Vertino, Boehm, Newsham, & Baylin, 1996); can
show sex differences in monoallelic tissue-specific
expression via parent of origin genetic effects (Pidsley
et al., 2012); can show loss of imprinting due to diet
(Waterland, Lin, Smith, & Jirtle, 2006); and has
important functional genomic relationships (Gonza-
lez-Rodriguez et al., 2016). Therefore, it will be
important to establish the extent to which the
present results can be replicated and extended with
the
addition of
these
molecular
and
epigenetic
mediators and moderators. Finally, it is important
to note that at the bivariate level, the association
between prenatal ‘unhealthy diet’, IFG2 methylation,
and ADHD was not significant (all p ≤ .10), but
became significant in the overall autoregressive
cross-lag model (i.e. when controlling for all other
variables in the model). While such a difference can

 arise when examining bivariate associations (show-
ing the degree of relationship between variables in a
pairwise fashion) versus multivariate associations
(i.e. which examine a system of predictions; e.g.
Tabachnick & Fidell, 2006), the present results
should be considered hypothesis-generating and
are in need of replication.
In summary, this study is the first to examine IGF2
DNA methylation as a potential intermediary biolog-
ical mechanism in the association between prenatal
diet and ADHD symptoms, for early-onset conduct
youth. That we did not find continuity in IGF2 DNA
methylation between birth and age 7 may support
ideas focusing on the prenatal maternal health as an
important risk for postnatal disease vulnerability
(Barker, 1995). For example, a prenatal maternal
high-fat and -sugar diet may alter the DNA methy-
lation status of the IGF2 gene at birth, which in turn,
may increase risk for a range of psychiatric and
health disorders. The present study highlights preg-
nancy as being a promising window of opportunity
for reducing the risk of ADHD symptoms associated
with the nutritional environment and IGF2 DNA
methylation. This is encouraging, given the poten-
tially modifiable nature of nutritional and epigenetic
risk factors.
