Abstract
Objective: Larger social networks have been associated with better breast cancer survival. To investi-
gate potential mediators, we evaluated associations of social network size and diversity with lifestyle
and treatment factors associated with prognosis.
Methods: We included 9331 women from the After Breast Cancer Pooling Project who provided
data on social networks within approximately two years following diagnosis. A social network index
was derived from information about the presence of a spouse or intimate partner, religious ties, com-
munity participation, friendship ties, and numbers of living relatives. Diversity was assessed as variety
of ties, independent of size. We used logistic regression to evaluate associations with outcomes and
evaluated whether effect estimates differed using meta-analytic techniques.
Results: Associations were similar across cohorts though analyses of smoking and alcohol included
US cohorts only because of low prevalence of these behaviors in the Shanghai cohort. Socially
isolated women were more likely to be obese (OR = 1.21, 95% CI:1.03–1.42), have low physical
activity (<10 MET-hours/week, OR = 1.55, 95% CI:1.36–1.78), be current smokers (OR = 2.77,
95% CI:2.09-3.68), and have high alcohol intake (≥15 g/d, OR = 1.23, 95% CI:1.00–1.51), compared
with socially integrated women. Among node positive cases from three cohorts, socially isolated
women were more likely not to receive chemotherapy (OR = 2.10, 95% CI:1.30–3.39); associations
differed in a fourth cohort. Other associations (nonsignificant) were consistent with less intensive
treatment in socially isolated women. Low social network diversity was independently associated
with more adverse lifestyle, but not clinical, factors.
Conclusions: Small, less diverse social networks measured post-diagnosis were associated with more
adverse lifestyle factors and less intensive cancer treatment.

Introduction
Over 230 000 cases of breast cancer (BC) are diagnosed,
and over 40 000 BC deaths occur each year [1]. Previous
studies have reported that larger, supportive social net-
works (SNs), defined as the web of social relationships
that surround an individual [2], are associated with better
survival after a BC diagnosis [3–5]. In a theoretical model
by Berkman and Glass [2], SNs influence health outcomes
through functional social support, social norms, social en-
gagement, access to resources, and subsequent effects on
biology and behavior. However, in women with BC, no
one has examined influences of SNs on lifestyle behav-
iors, i.e., daily habits over which a person has some con-
trol, such as diet, smoking, and physical activity, and
little research has examined influences on treatment.
Social network members may influence lifestyle and
treatment through instrumental, emotional, informational,
and other types of social support [6]. Social norms and
identification with SN members increase the likelihood
of adopting lifestyle behaviors similar to those members
[7,8]. Low SN diversity, defined as the variety of social
ties (connections) or roles, has been related to alcohol de-
pendency, smoking, low levels of physical activity [9,10],
and poorer health generally [11]. Norms have been shown
to influence screening [12]. Women’s social relationships
(e.g., spouse, family, and friends) have also been shown to
influence choice of mastectomy or lumpectomy [13],
whether to pursue chemotherapy [14], and other treatment
decisions [14]. Social relationships may also adversely
affect health-related outcomes through relationship obli-
gations or social strain, and related to this, reduced

 motivation for self-care and higher levels of psychological
distress. Lifestyle risk factors, including poor diet quality
[15], physical inactivity [16], smoking [17], and related
to these, obesity [18], as well as suboptimal treatment,
have each been associated with poorer BC-specific or
overall survival and may be mechanisms through which
social relationships influence BC outcomes.
Evaluating possible mechanisms may help draw inferences
about how social relationships influence health outcomes
in BC survivors, such as through social norms, support,
or engagement and thus inform potential opportunities
for developing effective social and clinical interventions.
Therefore, we examined associations between social ties,
and potential lifestyle and treatment mechanisms of BC
survival in a pooled cohort of four studies of 9331 women
with invasive BC from the After Breast Cancer Pooling
Project (ABCPP).
Methods
The After Breast Cancer Pooling Project
The ABCPP is an international collaboration of four pro-
spective studies of 18 333 women [19] from multiple US
sites and Shanghai, China, who were diagnosed with
stages I–IV invasive BC. Three of the cohorts, the Shanghai
Breast Cancer Survival Study (SBCSS) [20], the Life after
Cancer Epidemiology (LACE) Study [21], and the
Women’s Healthy Eating and Living (WHEL) Study
[22], specifically recruited patients with BC. The fourth
cohort included patients with BC diagnosed in the Nurses’
Health Study (NHS), a prospective study of female nurses
[23]. Each cohort collected data on clinical, social, repro-
ductive, and lifestyle factors. Data were harmonized into a
common dataset. Individual cohort investigators received
Institutional Review Board approval from their respective
institution(s) to participate in this collaboration. Details
regarding cohort creation and characteristics have been
published [19].
Study sample
Social data were collected in the SBCSS approximately
six months post-diagnosis. In WHEL and LACE, data
were collected on average about two years post-diagnosis.
In the NHS, we used data collected between diagnosis and
two years (mean, median=0.9 year) post-diagnosis; 26%
provided data ≤6 months of diagnosis.
To derive the study sample, we considered the signifi-
cance of missing data in each cohort. Because of the com-
plexity of the SN measures, we considered that failure to
complete specific survey items may denote a lack of a so-
cial tie and sought to avoid excluding these women be-
cause the requirement of complete data has been shown
to lead to bias [24]. In three of the cohorts (NHS, SBCSS,
and WHEL), most of the women with any missing
information were missing information for only one tie
(data not shown). In the LACE cohort, women tended to
have more missing data because questions about religious
and community participation were derived from a lengthy
time use survey designed to assess physical activity. Thus,
when data on physical activity were available but when
women omitted questions on religious or community par-
ticipation, we assumed that this meant they did not partic-
ipate in that activity. However, when physical activity and
religious and community participation data were both
missing, we assumed that women did not complete the
questionnaire because of the level of burden and did not
make assumptions about their participation.
If women were missing information for two or fewer
ties, we assumed that missing data signified a lack of a so-
cial tie. Women were excluded if they were missing data
on more than two ties (5.2%). We included 1947 women
from the LACE cohort, 2223 from the NHS cohort,
2194 from the SBCSS cohort, and 2967 from the WHEL
cohort (N=9331).
Data collection
Social networks and social diversity
The
ABCPP
Social
Network
Index
(ABCPP-SNI)
(Supporting Information Table S1) used in this analysis
was adapted from the Berkman–Syme Social Networks
Index [25] (B-SNI), which is frequently used in epidemi-
ological research and includes five components: a spouse
or intimate partner, number of relatives, friendship ties,
religious/social ties, and community ties. Approximate
tertiles of friendship ties were generated from single items
about numbers of, time with, support from, or ability to
maintain activities with, friends. The number of relatives
was summed based on available questions in each cohort
about the number of living children and relatives. To in-
corporate supportiveness into the computation of numbers
of relatives in WHEL, LACE, and SBCSS, we assigned an
extra point to those in the middle category of relatives
with high levels of support; higher supportiveness did
not further distinguish risk in socially isolated and inte-
grated women. We did this to better approximate the
B-SNI and generate comparable results across cohorts;
the NHS built ‘closeness’ into questions about relatives.
Women were assigned 1 or 0 points depending on
whether or not they were married/in an intimate relation-
ship, engaged or not in community participation, or
engaged or not in religious participation, and 1, 2, or
3 points for cohort-specific tertiles of the sum of relatives
or tertiles of friends. A higher score signifies greater social
integration. Results using similar approaches have been
published [26–28].
Information on religious participation was not available
in the Shanghai cohort. Therefore, we calculated the
ABCPP-SNI separately in each cohort and divided the

 index into cohort-specific tertiles of women before
pooling data, representing those who were socially iso-
lated, moderately integrated, and socially integrated. We
standardized the continuous SN score (mean=0, standard
deviation=1) for analyses of trend. The questions and
measures used to derive the SN index in each cohort are
presented in Supporting Information Table S1.
To examine SN diversity, independent of SN size, we
generated a variable from the sum of the different types
of ties, with a point added for medium or large friend net-
works rather than using the binary any versus no friends,
because almost all women reported at least one close
friend and larger friendship networks may be more diverse
[29]. To ensure independence of the diversity and size var-
iables, we categorized the diversity variable into a dichot-
omous ‘high’ versus ‘low’ diversity variable within each
cohort and each SN size category; this variable had a sim-
ilar distribution within each SN category.
Sociodemographic and reproductive characteristics
Available sociodemographic and reproductive data in-
cluded race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic
Black, Asian, Hispanic, and other) and education (less
than high school, high school, some college, and college
graduate). Data on menopausal status at diagnosis (pre-
menopausal, postmenopausal, and unknown), parity, and
age at first birth were also available.
Lifestyle factors and body mass index
Lifestyle factors were measured at the time of the assess-
ment of social variables. Smoking history was self-
reported (never, past, and current). Recreational physical
activity in metabolic equivalents (MET-hours/week) was
determined from validated semi-quantitative question-
naires [30]. Height and weight were self-reported in LACE
and NHS; in the SBCSS and WHEL, height and weight
were measured during study visits. Body mass index
(BMI) in kg/m2 was derived from weight and height.
Information on alcohol intake (g/d) was derived from
validated food frequency questionnaires [31].
Clinical characteristics and breast cancer treatment
Available clinical and treatment data included age at diag-
nosis (years), American Joint Committee on Cancer
(AJCC) stage (I, II, III, and IV), estrogen receptor (ER)/
progesterone receptor (PR) status (ER+/PR+, ER+/PR�,
and ER�/PR), nodal status (cancer spread to lymph nodes
or not), HER2 status (positive and negative), and any co-
morbidity (diabetes, hypertension, myocardial infarction,
or stroke).
Treatment information included data on surgery (none,
lumpectomy, mastectomy, and unknown), chemotherapy
(no and yes), radiation therapy (no and yes), and hormonal
therapy (no and yes).
Outcome variables
From data on lifestyle factors and BMI, we generated di-
chotomous outcomes. These included weight variables
(overweight, BMI≥25 kg/m2 (yes vs. no) and obesity,
BMI≥30 kg/m2 (yes vs. no)), high alcohol intake (alco-
hol consumption≥15 g/d vs. not), low physical activity
(<10 vs. ≥10 MET-hours/week), and current smoking
(yes vs. no).
From clinical data, we generated outcomes including
receipt of chemotherapy (yes vs. no) among women with
node-positive cancers, radiation (yes vs. no) among those
obtaining lumpectomy, and hormonal therapy (yes vs.
no) among those with hormone receptor positive cancers.
We also generated a variable among women who had
surgery—lumpectomy vs. mastectomy—to evaluate whether
SNs were related to less invasive surgery.
Statistical analyses
Using analysis of covariance and Mantel–Haenszel chi-
squared tests, we examined age-adjusted associations be-
tween SN categories and potential confounding variables.
Validation of the ABC social networks index
The original B-SNI [25] has four levels—socially inte-
grated, moderately integrated, moderately isolated, and
socially isolated. To compare the B-SNI to the ABCPP-
SNI, both which we were able to derive in the NHS (only),
we categorized scores for the ABCPP-SNI based on the
distribution of the scores of the original B-SNI. Then we
computed
the
Spearman
correlation
between
the
ABCPP-SNI and the B-SNI for the NHS women, evalu-
ated the concordance between the measures using the
weighted kappa statistic and compared the indexes in
terms of the magnitude of associations with outcomes.
Analyses of SNs and clinical and lifestyle factors
Our goal was to examine cross-sectional associations
between SNs assessed within approximately two years
following diagnosis and lifestyle and clinical variables.
First, we evaluated categories of SN size with clinical
and lifestyle factors. We also evaluated additional models
for SN diversity, adjusted simultaneously for SN size. We
subsequently evaluated associations between each type of
social tie (e.g., married/intimate partner, friends, relatives,
community participation, and religious participation),
adjusted simultaneously for other ties, and outcome
variables.
Each analysis involved three steps. First, multiple logis-
tic regression models were used to estimate study-specific
adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals
(CI) for associations of SNs with each outcome variable
(i.e., weight, current smoking, physical activity, alcohol
consumption, and treatment). Second, a meta-analysis

 was conducted, combining study-specific ORs using
inverse-variance weights in random-effects models [32].
The Q test statistic was used to assess heterogeneity in risk
estimates across studies [33]. When evidence for hetero-
geneity was not observed (p>0.05; this was the case for
all associations but one), the studies were pooled and asso-
ciations between SNs and clinical and lifestyle variables
were evaluated using logistic regression adjusted for study
in addition to the covariates listed in the succeeding texts.
Otherwise, the Q test statistic and separate results were re-
ported. Tests for linear trend of SN size were conducted
using the standardized, continuous measure. In analyses
with simultaneous adjustment for SN size and diversity,
we evaluated significance for diversity using the Wald χ2
test for the dichotomous variable.
In analyses of treatment, because chemotherapy and
hormonal therapy are not indicated for all women with
BC, our analyses of the likelihood of chemotherapy
were limited to women with node positive cancers,
and analyses of hormonal therapy were restricted to
those with ER+ BC. Although there is latitude for
choice in surgery, we examined lumpectomy versus
mastectomy for additional insight but without making
an assumption as to expected therapy. We attempted to
examine associations with radiotherapy among those
with lumpectomy, but only 70 women (2%) who had
lumpectomy did not have radiotherapy so we had insuf-
ficient power to examine this treatment outcome.
Covariates in multivariable-adjusted models were cho-
sen based on a priori determination from literature re-
view. These included age at diagnosis, time between
diagnosis
and
SN
assessment,
study,
education,
race/ethnicity, AJCC stage, hormone receptor status,
Her2 neu status, parity, menopausal status at diagnosis,
comorbidity, treatment (types of treatment other than
the outcome including chemotherapy, radiation, surgery,
and hormone therapy), and lifestyle and related factors
(factors other than the outcome including smoking,
physical activity, BMI, and alcohol) were included. We
allowed missing categories for all covariates; this ap-
proach produced qualitatively similar findings to those
obtained in sensitivity analyses employing multiple im-
putation or requiring complete case ascertainment (data
not shown).
Finally, we stratified by education (< vs. any college
education), age (≥ vs. < median=56 years), and comor-
bidity (no vs. any). However, we were limited in our
ability to examine associations by race/ethnicity. We
computed interaction terms based on the cross product
of the continuous SNs variable and each of these dichot-
omous variables when associations differed by strata and
evaluated interactions with Wald χ2 tests. Finally, we
conducted sensitivity analyses excluding data provided
≤6 months because diagnosis, because associations may
differ among those undergoing initial treatment.
Results
Women from the LACE (median=58.9, IQR:50.8, 67.1)
and NHS (median=65.1, IQR:59.3, 70.5) cohorts were
older than women from the SBCSS (median=51.0,
IQR:45.9, 61.5) and WHEL (median=50.7, IQR:45.4,
57.6) cohorts. Women with smaller SNs had higher levels
of education and a larger interval between diagnosis and
SNs assessment. They were younger and more likely to
be White and nulliparous, and they were less likely to have
a Her2 neu positive cancer. Age, menopausal status at di-
agnosis, cancer stage, and ER status were not related to
SN size (Table 1).
Validation of the ABC social networks index
Correlation between the SN indexes was high, r=0.72,
p<0.001 and the κ =0.60 was moderately high, sug-
gesting fairly good concordance between the two mea-
sures. The SNI measures were similarly predictive
(data not shown).
Social networks and lifestyle factors
Associations between SNs and lifestyle factors did not
differ by cohort and were pooled. After adjustment for
potential confounding variables, socially isolated women
were more likely to be current smokers (US cohorts)
(OR=2.77, 95% CI:2.09–3.68), have low levels of physi-
cal activity (OR=1.55, 95% CI:1.36–1.78), have a
BMI≥30 kg/m2 (OR=1.21, 95% CI:1.03–1.42), and con-
sume ≥15 g/d alcohol (OR=1.23, 95% CI:1.00–1.51),
compared with socially integrated women. Social isolation
was not associated with overweight (BMI≥25 kg/m2) sta-
tus (data not shown), although moderately integrated
women had a lower odds of overweight compared with so-
cially integrated women (OR=0.89, 95% CI: 0.80–0.98).
Social network size and SN diversity were indepen-
dently associated with each lifestyle factor (Tables 2
and 3). Specifically, adjusted for SN size, low SN diver-
sity was associated with low levels of physical activity
(OR=1.23,
95%
CI:1.12–1.36),
a
BMI≥30
kg/m2
(OR=1.13, 95% CI:1.00–1.28), current smoking (OR=1.96,
95% CI:1.58–2.43), and ≥15 g/d alcohol consumption
(OR=1.18, 95% CI:1.01–1.38).
Looking separately at the different types of ties,
women who were married or in an intimate relationship
were less likely to be current smokers. Women with
few friendship ties were more likely to have low levels
of physical activity and to be obese, but were less likely
to have high alcohol intake. Women engaged in commu-
nity participation were less likely to report low levels of
physical activity or current smoking, but community par-
ticipation was not associated with other lifestyle vari-
ables.
Those
who
did
not
participate
in
religious
organizations were more likely to report current smoking
and high alcohol intake. Small networks of relatives

 predicted higher alcohol intake but a lower risk of obe-
sity (Supporting Information Table S2).
Social networks and BC treatment
Associations between SNs and surgery and hormonal ther-
apy did not differ by cohort, and associations were pooled.
However, associations of social isolation with odds of
chemotherapy differed for the WHEL cohort compared
with the other three cohorts (Q test statistic=8.39,
p=0.04), explained by a greater likelihood of receiving
chemotherapy among those without religious ties (data
not shown), and overall results for WHEL were presented
separately.
As indicated, stage was unrelated to SN size (Table 1).
However, among women (LACE, NHS, and SBCSS)
with node positive cancers, those who were socially
isolated were more likely not to receive chemotherapy
(OR= 2.10, 95% CI:1.30–3.39), compared with socially
integrated women (no association in WHEL). Associa-
tions

only,
OR = 1.09, 95% CI:0.95–1.25) and lumpectomy versus
mastectomy (OR = 1.22, 95% CI:0.97–1.55) were in
the same direction (socially isolated women more
likely not to receive treatment) but were nonsignificant
(Table 2). SN diversity was unrelated to odds of treat-
ment (Table 3).
Regarding different types of social ties, women who
were unmarried/not in an intimate relationship were
more likely not to receive chemotherapy (OR=1.44,
95% CI:1.03–2.00) or hormonal therapy (OR=1.18,
95% CI:0.99–1.40). Women with few friendship ties
were also more likely not to receive chemotherapy
(OR=1.54, 95% CI:1.02–2.31) or hormonal treatment
(OR=1.32, 95% CI:1.11–1.58). No tie was related to
type of surgery. Women with few ties to relatives were
also more likely not to receive chemotherapy (OR=1.57,
95% CI:1.11–2.23), although ties to relatives were

 unrelated to other types of treatment. Neither community
nor religious participation was related to treatment
(Supporting Information Table S3).
In stratified analysis, associations did not differ by
education level. The association with chemotherapy dif-
fered somewhat by median age (p-test for interac-
tion=0.06) with the association appearing stronger in
older women. There was a significant interaction by co-
morbidity for type of surgery, with a significantly higher
odds
of
lumpectomy
with
low
social
integration
(OR=1.35, 95% CI:1.06–1.74) among those without co-
morbidity and a significantly lower odds of lumpectomy
(OR=0.24, 95% CI:0.08–0.69) among those with comor-
bidity (p-test for interaction=0.002), but only 8% of
women in the cohort had any comorbidity. Associations
were not qualitatively different when we restricted analy-
ses to those with data provided ≥6 months post-diagnosis.
Discussion
Consistent with our hypothesis, social isolation in BC
survivors was related to less favorable post-diagnosis
lifestyle factors and less intensive BC treatment.
Specifically, socially isolated women were more likely
to be current smokers, have low physical activity,
have high alcohol intake, and be obese. They were
also less likely to receive chemotherapy. Women with
low SN diversity also had worse lifestyle, but SN
diversity was not independently related to treatment.
Types of ties were differently predictive of lifestyle,
but friends, relatives, and a spouse/intimate partner
were the only significant predictors of treatment. As-
sociations were independent of disease severity, age,
obesity, or comorbidity status. To our knowledge, this
is the first study examining associations between SNs,

Social networks, lifestyle, and treatment

 SN diversity, and lifestyle and treatment following a
BC diagnosis. Findings provide evidence for the influ-
ence of social environment on lifestyle and clinical
factors, which may have implications for survival in
women with BC.
Findings for SN size, but not diversity, and chemo-
therapy suggest that close relationships are important to
the ability to undergo chemotherapy. Large SNs may in-
crease the odds that women have friends and family to
rely on for instrumental (e.g., rides to the hospital, trips
to the pharmacy, assistance with exercise, or provision
of healthy meals) and social–emotional support [6].
Having someone to assist with needs may also influence
decisions about whether to pursue more intensive treat-
ment, given latitude in treatment decision-making [34].
Nonsignificant associations with hormonal therapy and
surgery were in the same direction; women with small
SNs consistently received less treatment than did those
who were socially integrated. While multiple consider-
ations influence the development of treatment plans,
these findings suggest that some women who would
benefit from more intensive treatment may not receive
it, predicted by level of social integration. Potentially,
in the face of side effects, as well as daily responsibili-
ties, women with small SNs may lack adequate support
to persist with intensive treatment. Because women with
smaller SNs are less healthy and engage in less healthy
behavior, SNs could be an indicator of conditions pre-
dictive of less intensive treatment such as older age,
frailty, or obesity. However, adjustment for age, comor-
bidity, and BMI did not attenuate associations with
clinical factors.
Additional research is needed to determine whether the
absence
of
social
support
or
existence
of
social
strain/obligation leads to different decisions, by the patient
or provider, about level of treatment. Collecting data on
social ties within health care settings would help identify
patients with BC at potential risk. Additional work is also
needed to determine appropriate intervention strategies in
those who differ with regard to the cause of their social

 isolation including demographic, personality, mental
health, and other factors.
Every type of social tie was important to lifestyle fac-
tors, depending on the risk factor, whereas only ties to
a spouse, friends, or relatives predicted treatment. Differ-
ences in the nature and direction of relationships suggest
that the roles of SN ties differ; this is consistent with pre-
vious literature showing that partners, family, and friends
are more important than other ties to provision of infor-
mal caregiving [35].
Religious participation was strongly related to lower
smoking and alcohol consumption, consistent with pre-
vious studies and norms of participation [36]. More fa-
vorable lifestyle with community participation suggests
that participation helps to maintain better health or that
better health enables women to participate. Volunteering
and community participation have been related to higher
physical activity [37], lower blood pressure, and better
cardiovascular health. Also consistent with our findings,
previous literature has repeatedly shown the salutary ef-
fects of being married, including better BC survival
[38], although effects may depend on the quality of rela-
tionships [39]. The roles of social ties to lifestyle and
treatment in BC survivors differed, but in general,
larger, more diverse SNs were related to lifestyle and
clinical factors associated with better prognosis.
A major strength of the current analysis was the abil-
ity to examine associations in a very large cohort of eth-
nically, socioeconomically, and geographically diverse
BC survivors. Related to this, another strength was the
ability to harmonize the studies to develop a valid mea-
sure of SNs assessed in each of the cohorts post-
diagnosis. In addition, we minimized confounding by
adjusting for variables related to BC severity, including
stage, hormone receptor status, and HER2 status; repro-
ductive history; and lifestyle, demographic, and socio-
economic variables.
One limitation was the lack of complete SNs informa-
tion across cohorts. However, generating study-specific
tertiles helped to overcome this limitation. Additionally,
our results may not generalize to women of lower socio-
economic status (SES), who were not well represented in
this population; this may lead to an underestimate of the
association because women of low SES have smaller
SNs [40]. Strikingly, associations did not differ in the
Shanghai versus the US cohorts. Also, although we had
limited power, associations did not appear to differ by
white/non-white race/ethnicity within the USA (data not
shown). Nonetheless, future studies should include a
larger number of non-white participants.
Of concern, associations were cross sectional and
disease severity could influence SN size. However, there
is evidence that SNs may not change dramatically across
diagnosis [4]. Additionally, SNs were not associated
with BC stage in this study, notable given that the large
sample size can increase the chance of significant
associations. Also, while there may be bi-directional
influences between SNs and lifestyle factors in patients
with BC, it is unlikely that treatment would substantially
influence marital status or numbers of relatives or living
children
in
this
population.
We
also
adjusted
for
education as a measure of SES, a potentially important
predictor of both SN variables and lifestyle factors. Of
benefit, post-diagnosis data may most accurately reflect
the level of support available during and following
treatment.
Other limitations include different timing of SNs mea-
sures across the cohorts, missing covariate data, and di-
chotomous treatment outcomes. Despite these limitations,
associations were similar across cohorts and sensitivity
analyses suggested robust associations. Future work
should more carefully look at treatment delays, decisions,
and adherence to treatment.
To summarize, smaller, less diverse SNs were related to
a higher risk of adverse lifestyle and less intensive treat-
ment in BC survivors. Given the rising costs of health care
and the aging of the population, there is a growing need to
understand how social relationships influence disease
progression.
The authors declare that they have no financial conflicts
of interest.
