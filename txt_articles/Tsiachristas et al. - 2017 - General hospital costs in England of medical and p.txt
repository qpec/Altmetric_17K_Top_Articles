General hospital costs in England of medical and psychiatric 
care for patients who self-harm: a retrospective analysis

Summary
Background Self-harm is an extremely common reason for hospital presentation. However, few estimates have been 
made of the hospital costs of assessing and treating self-harm. Such information is essential for planning services and 
to help strengthen the case for investment in actions to reduce the frequency and effects of self-harm. In this study, 
we aimed to calculate the costs of hospital medical care associated with a self-harm episode and the costs of 
psychosocial assessment, together with identification of the key drivers of these costs.
Methods In a retrospective analysis, we estimated hospital resource use and care costs for all presentations for self-
harm to the John Radcliffe Hospital (Oxford, UK), between April 1, 2013, and March 31, 2014. Episode-related data 
were provided by the Oxford Monitoring System for Self-harm and we linked these with financial hospital records to 
quantify costs. We assessed time and resources allocated to psychosocial assessments through discussion with clinical 
and managerial staff. We then used generalised linear models to investigate the associations between hospital costs 
and methods of self-harm.
Findings Between April 1, 2013, and March 31, 2014, 1647 self-harm presentations by 1153 patients were recorded. Of 
these, 1623 (99%) presentations by 1140 patients could be linked with hospital finance records. 179 (16%) patients 
were younger than 18 years. 1150 (70%) presentations were for self-poisoning alone, 367 (22%) for self-injury alone, 
and 130 (8%) for a combination of methods. Psychosocial assessments were made in 75% (1234) of all episodes. The 
overall mean hospital cost per episode of self-harm was £809. Costs differed significantly between different types of 
self-harm: self-injury alone £753 (SD 2061), self-poisoning alone £806 (SD 1568), self-poisoning and self-injury £987 
(SD 1823; p<0·0001). Costs were mainly associated with the type of health-care service contact such as inpatient 
stay, intensive care, and psychosocial assessment. Mean costs of psychosocial assessments were £228 for adults and 
£392 for individuals younger than 18 years.
Interpretation If our findings are extrapolated to England, the estimated overall annual cost of general hospital 
management of self-harm is £162 million per year. More use of psychosocial assessment and other preventive 
measures, especially for young people and against self-poisoning, could potentially lower future costs at a time of 
major cost pressures in the NHS.

Introduction
Self-harm is a major public health challenge in many 
countries worldwide. In a 2016 report1 from the 
Multicentre Study of Self-Harm in England, age-
standardised rates of hospital-presenting self-harm of 
362 per 100 000 population were estimated for men and 
441 per 100 000 population for women. Extrapolated to 
England as a whole this equates to more than 
200 000 episodes every year. Despite its public health 
effects, limited information is published about the 
economic costs of self-harm. What is known about 
the costs of self-harm needs to be improved, both to 
better inform service planning and, perhaps more 
fundamentally, to highlight the extent of the problem 
and the need for services. This information could also be 
used to estimate potential savings in resource use and 
costs to the NHS through increased investment in 
effective measures both to prevent initial episodes of 
self-harm and reduce the risk of subsequent events for 
those who have self-harmed. Having more accurate 
information about the costs of self-harm is also 
an essential prerequisite to assessment of the cost-
effectiveness of different actions, including use of 
psychosocial assessment and psychological therapies.
Only a small number of studies in England have 
attempted to cost self-harm events and most of these have 
focused on the costs of self-poisoning alone2,3 rather than 
all types of self-harm. One exception was an analysis using 
data for individuals originally identified after self-harm in 
1997 and followed-up to 2005, to estimate longer-term 
costs to health and social care services after their initial 
and subsequent self-harm episodes. In this study,4 
inpatient psychiatric care accounted for two-thirds of costs 
in the year after the initial self-harm event. The National 
 Articles

Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has also 
modelled the costs of providing initial and ongoing 
psychological support to adults who have self-harmed, but 
did not combine this with information about the initial 
(physical) health-care costs of treatment for self-harm.5
Robust evidence about these costs is necessary to plan 
service provision and assess the effect of interventions 
targeting self-harm. Such an intervention is the 
psychosocial assessment to help determine subsequent 
care for patients who have self-harmed.5,6 Therefore, in 
this study, we aimed to calculate the costs of hospital 
medical care associated with a self-harm episode and 
the costs of psychosocial assessment, together with 
identification of the key drivers of these costs.
Methods
Study setting and self-harm data
We did a year-long retrospective longitudinal study to 
estimate the hospital care costs associated with self-harm 
in a single major general hospital, the John Radcliffe 
Hospital (Oxford, UK). All patients attending the hospital 
after self-harm between April 1, 2013, and March 31, 2014, 
were identified through the Oxford Monitoring System 
(OMS) for Self-harm. Self-harm is defined as intentional 
self-poisoning or self-injury, irrespective of the degree of 
suicidal intention or other types of motives.7 Data 
routinely collected include general self-harm method (ie, 
self-poisoning, self-injury, or both), specific self-harm 
method (eg, poisoning by specific drugs, cutting), hospital 
admission, patient sociodemographic characteristics (eg, 
age, gender, residence, and employment status), and 
resource use (eg, length of inpatient stay, provision of 
psychosocial-assessment). The OMS routinely collects 
data from two sources: clinicians who do psychosocial 
assessments and record demographic, clinical, and 
hospital management data on each episode, and research 
clerks who scrutinise emergency department electronic 
databases for patients who do not receive a psychosocial 
assessment. The sample consisted of 1647 non-fatal self-
harm presentations by 1153 patients in 2013–14. These 
self-harm presentations were then linked with 2013–14 
financial hospital records (Oxford University Hospitals 
NHS Trust) to obtain the costs associated with them. The 
pattern of self-harm in Oxford is similar to that of other 
centres in England where self-harm presentations are 
identified systematically, except that rates of self-harm 
in Oxford are somewhat lower than in more socio-
economically deprived areas.1
The Oxford Monitoring System for Self-harm has 
ethical approval from the NHS Health Research 
Authority (NRES Committee South Central, Berkshire). 
The OMS also has approval from the Health Research 
Authority Confidentiality Advisory Group under Section 
251 of the NHS Act 2006 to collect non-anonymised 
patient details without patient consent.
Costs of medical treatment
We obtained costs for 1623 self-harm presentations by 
1140 patients (ie, 99% of the total sample). These 
costs included emergency department attendances, 
treatments received in the emergency department and 
hospital wards, and hospital ward and critical care unit 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and EconLit for 
articles published in any language between Jan 1, 1988, and Jan 
31, 2017, that provide evidence for the immediate costs to 
health-care systems of intentional self-harm, as well as the costs 
of psychosocial assessment. The terms “suicide” and “self-harm” 
were combined with “costs” and “economic evaluation” in the 
search process, resulting in 5354 hits and 131 articles examining 
cost. UK studies focused mainly on costs of self-poisoning with 
little focus on the costs of self-injury, similar to studies done in 
Belgium, Ireland, Spain, and the USA. Detailed immediate 
health-care costs for all methods of self-harm are rare; examples 
include evaluation in England (although costs were not 
disaggregated by method of self-harm) and Switzerland. 
Furthermore, limited information exists about the costs of 
initial psychosocial assessment in these studies. In England, 
NICE previously relied on NHS Reference Costs for psychiatric 
consultations as an indicator of the costs of psychosocial 
assessments after self-harm.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the most detailed analysis of the 
immediate general hospital costs of self-harm in an English 
hospital to date, taking account and estimating the costs of 
psychosocial assessment and providing different estimates of 
cost for different types of self-harm. Our findings show that the 
mean hospital cost per episode of self-harm was £809. 
Treatment of combined self-poisoning and self-injury is the 
most complex. Hospital management of children and 
adolescents who self-harm is more costly than that for adults. 
Psychosocial assessment costs a mean of £254; £392 per 
assessment for patients younger than 18 years and £228 for 
assessments for adults. 
Implications of all available evidence
Extrapolating our findings to the whole of England would mean 
that the overall costs for self-harm management (assuming 
75% of cases, as in the study hospital, include psychosocial 
assessment) in general hospitals are substantial. Using our 
costings, if psychosocial assessment were done for every self-
harm presentation, as suggested in NICE guidelines, this would 
cost around £51 million per year. The study provides 
fundamental information that can be used to inform economic 
modelling analyses to better assess the potential costs and 
benefits of policies to address self-harm.

stays. The perspective of this study is that of the hospital 
provider: the costs represent financial costs to the 
hospital rather than reimbursement values or the 
average costs to the NHS.
Costs of psychosocial assessment
Psychosocial assessment by trained mental health 
professionals is recommended in the NICE guidelines for 
self-harm and includes the assessment of patients’ needs 
and risks with the aim of determining appropriate 
aftercare.5,6 For younger patients there is an emphasis on 
addressing safeguarding issues. NICE also recommends 
that all patients younger than 16 years who present to 
hospital after self-harm are admitted to a hospital bed.8 
During the study period most patients who underwent 
psychosocial assessment were seen by a member of 
the emergency department psychiatric service, which 
is staffed by psychiatric clinical nurse specialists, 
psychiatrists in training, and general practitioner (GP) 
trainees. This service includes regular supervision 
sessions. During the study period, a consultant-led liaison 
psychiatry service was developed in the general hospital 
of Oxford University Hospital Trust (the OUH team), 
which provided assessments for a small number of adult 
patients, namely those admitted to non-emergency 
department wards.
We estimated the costs of time spent by different 
health-care professionals in developing, delivering, and 
managing psychosocial assessments for patients who 
self-harmed during the financial year 2013–14. The costs 
of the OUH liaison psychiatry service, for which it was 
not possible to separate psychosocial assessment costs 
from general hospital costs, were already included in the 
general hospital costs. In addition to those who delivered 
the assessment (ie, psychiatric clinical nurse specialists, 
GP trainees, and junior doctors), these assessment 
costs included psychiatrists’ time as well as supervision 
and administrative support provided by administration 
officers. We used information from a finance manager in 
the Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust, as well as 
extensive discussions with clinical staff, to determine the 
proportion of full time equivalents (FTE) devoted by each 
of these professionals to psychosocial assessments.
We valued time using gross mid-band salary rates 
(including employer’s contribution to national insurance 
and pensions). We inflated salary costs by a factor of 20% 
to account for overhead costs, such as for accommodation, 
equipment, utility bills, and cleaning. This factor is usually 
used by financial administrators in NHS for overhead 
costs. We separately calculated the cost of psychosocial 
assessment for patients younger than 18 years and for 
those 18 years and older. We did this by proportionally 
allocating the FTEs of each clinician relative to the number 
of assessments that they delivered to each age group. We 
then calculated the costs per assessment by dividing total 
costs by the number of assessments delivered in 2013–14 
for the two age groups separately. The costs of psychosocial 
assessments were added to all other hospital medical costs 
to determine total hospital costs.
Statistical analysis
We report descriptive statistics (ie, distribution and 
central tendency) about the study population, methods of 
self-harm, related services, and costs. Non-parametric 
tests were used to test differences in costs between 
two (Mann-Whitney test) or more (Kruskal-Wallis test) 
independent samples. The approach we used to prepare 
and do the regression analysis included the specification of 
model structure and improvement of model fit to the data.
To specify the structure of the model (ie, which variables 
to include), we designed an association pathway between 
self-harm and costs of self-harm on the basis of available 
data.9 The association pathway (figure) included four 
groups of variables: total cost (ie, the sum of costs of 
psychosocial assessment, emergency care, inpatient care, 
and critical care) is the outcome variable; the general self-
harm method (ie, self-poisoning alone, self-injury alone, 
both self-poisoning and self-injury), specific self-poisoning 
method, and specific self-injury method are the three 
variables of interest or exposure variables; hospital services 
received by patients, including inpatient admission, 
length of inpatient stay, psychosocial assessment, care

from the OUH psychiatric team, and critical care were 
defined as intermediate variables; and morbidity, age, sex, 
occupational status, residence, ethnicity, and number of 
hospital self-harm episodes for each patient were grouped 
as possible confounding variables. The exposure variables 
can have a direct association and an indirect association 
with the outcome variable (figure). The indirect association 
is via the intermediate variables. We assumed the 
confounding variables were directly associated with the 
outcome and exposure variables. Hence, the association 
pathway shows that the type and method of self-harm 
might be associated with hospital care costs of self-harm 
in two ways (ie, direct association and indirect association 
via the intermediate variables). We specified a model that 
included the variable categories—outcomes, exposure, 
intermediate, and confounding—in a regression analysis 
to capture both possible association pathways between 
self-harm and costs. This model was specified for each of 
the three exposure variables, resulting in three possible 
model structures.
We 
used 
generalised 
linear 
models 
using 
gamma distribution in the analysis to deal with 
potentially highly skewed costs resulting from many low 
cost episodes and a few episodes with extremely high 
costs. The link function of the generalised linear models 
was chosen based on the Akaike information criterion 
(AIC), the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and the 
log-likelihood of the Pregibon link-test. The full 
regression models (ie, models with all confounders and 
intermediate variables as independent variables) were 
reduced based on Likelihood-Ratio tests to specify the 
structure of the model that best fitted the data. Given the 
low proportion of individuals with more than one 
repeated self-harm episode, our main analysis concerned 
a non-hierarchical model structure with standard errors 
allowing for intragroup correlation. For sensitivity 
analysis, we reproduced the best fitting generalised 
linear models using a two-level approach (ie, episodes of 
self-harm nested within individuals). Details on model 
specification are provided in the appendix. We did all 
analyses using STATA 13.

Results
Between April 1, 2013, and March 31, 2014, 1647 self-harm 
presentations by 1153 patients were recorded. Of these, 
1623 (99%) presentations by 1140 patients could be linked 
with hospital finance records. 179 (16%) of 1153 patients 
were younger than 18 years and 69 (6%) were older than 
60 years (table 1). Most were female (719 [62%]), white 
(1014 [88%]), and living at home (885 [76%]). 292 (25%) 
were recorded as being employed, 231 (20%) reported 
being unemployed, 224 (19%) were students, and 164 
(14%) were disabled or retired. 430 (38%) were identified 
as having at least one mental health condition but 
346 (30%) patients were assessed as having neither a 
long-term physical or mental health condition (table 1).
Of 1647 episodes of self-harm, self-poisoning alone 
was the most frequently used method (1150 [70%]), 
followed by self-injury alone (367 [22%]) and combined

self-poisoning and self-injury (130 [8%]) (table 2). Self-
cutting (334 [67%] of 496) was the most frequently used 
method of self-injury, followed by hanging (46 [9%]) 
and jumping (14 [3%]), and a variety of other methods 
accounted for 97 (20%) of all self-injuries. Most self-
poisoning episodes included a single drug group (748 
[65%]) and paracetamol was included in 481 (42%) of 
all cases. 1274 (77%) self-harm episodes resulted in 
admission to hospital (this included admission to 
an emergency department short stay bed). A psycho-
 
social assessment occurred in 1234 (75%) episodes, 
1124 (88%) episodes with hospital admission and just 
110 (30%) episodes without hospital admission (data 
not shown). For individuals admitted as inpatients, 
most stayed in hospital for 24–48 h (646 [51%]), followed 
by less than 24 h (420 [33%]), and more than 48 h 
(211 [17%]). Only 31 (2%) of all episodes received 
intensive care treatment. The vast majority of patients 
presented only once during the study period (942 [82%]); 
129 (11%) had one additional presentation, 33 (3%) had 
two additional presentations, and 49 (4%) had more 
than two additional presentations.
Psychosocial assessment was estimated to cost an 
average of £254 for all patients, including £392 per 
assessment for patients younger than 18 years and 
£228 for adults (appendix). Mean hospital costs were 
£809 (SD 1079) per self-harm episode, including psycho-
social assessment costs, emergency attendance, inpatient 
stay, and critical care (table 3). Proportionally, more 
patients were admitted to a hospital bed after self-
poisoning (986 [86%]) than after self-injury (179 [49%]). 
However, patients who self-injured stayed in hospital on 
average half a day longer than patients who self-poisoned, 
resulting in an average of £456 higher hospitalisation 
costs. The lowest costs in non-admitted patients were in 
those who had self-injured. Patients who had both self-
injured and self-poisoned had the highest hospital costs 
(£987; SD 1823), followed by those who self-poisoned 
alone (£806; SD 1568), or self-injured alone (£753; 
SD 2061). Detailed descriptive statistics of costs are in the 
appendix.
The generalised linear models with γ distribution and 
identity link function had the best fit to the data for each of 
the three regression models (ie, self-harm type, self-injury 
method, or self-poisoning method as the exposure variable; 
appendix p 1; table 4). Model 1 shows that self-harm 
patients who received a psychosocial assessment had on 
average £270 (95% CI 223 to 316) higher costs (including

the costs of psychosocial assessment) than non-assessed 
patients. Those who were admitted to hospital had on 
average £155 (97 to 214) higher costs than non-admitted 
patients, £161 (114 to 207) higher for each inpatient day and 
£6180 (3724 to 8635) higher if they received treatment in 
intensive care. Age, which was the only confounder 
contributing to the fit of the model, had a U-shape 
association with costs. Costs were initially reduced from 
age 13 years by £101 (–179 to –22) per 10 additional life-
years; from the age of 39 years costs increased by 
£13 (2 to 23) per 10 additional life years after adjusting for 
the other covariates (data not shown). After adjusting for 
hospital use (intermediate) variables and age, self-
poisoning alone was £120 (22 to 218) more costly than self-
injury alone and the combination of self-poisoning and 
self-injury was £74 (26 to 121) more costly. Model 2 shows 
that among patients who self-injured, no cost differences 
were found across self-injury methods after adjusting for 
psychosocial assessment, hospital admission, inpatient 
length of stay, and treatment by the OUH team. Model 3 
shows that episodes of patients who self-poisoned using 
multiple medicines, including tricyclic antidepressants 
and paracetamol, were a mean of £56 (–95 to –17) less costly 
than episodes involving major tranquillisers and mood 
stabilisers after adjusting for psychosocial assessment, 
hospital admission, inpatient length of stay, and treatment 
in intensive care. The results of the full regression models 
are in the appendix (pp 2–4). The results of the sensitivity 
analysis (ie, when specifying multilevel models) are also in 
the appendix (p 6). The coefficients and p values from the 
multi-level models were very similar to those presented 
in table 4.
Discussion
Our findings show that the mean hospital cost per episode 
of self-harm was £809. These costs are mainly driven by 
the health-care services used after self-harm, such as 
admission to hospital, inpatient length of stay, treatment 
in intensive care, and psychosocial assessment. Holding 
all else constant, costs differed significantly between 
different types of self-harm, with self-injury alone being 
associated with the lower costs, followed by self-poisoning 
alone (£74 higher than self-injury), and self-injury and self-
poisoning combined (£120 higher than self-injury alone).
Although for patients admitted to a hospital bed, self-
poisoning was associated with a shorter inpatient stay 
than self-injury, we have shown that the treatment of 
patients who self-poisoned was more complex and more 
costly per hospital day than the treatment of patients 
who self-injured. However, we found no significant 
differences in costs within the specific types of self-injury 
methods and self-poisoning methods.
We also estimated the mean cost of psychosocial 
assessment to be £254 but found a difference of £164 
between psychosocial assessment for patients younger 
than 18 years (£392) and the mean cost for adults (£228). 
This reflects the fact that children and adolescents 
often have complex needs that require more time 
for assessment compared with adult patients. This is 
likely to be determined by greater need to interview 
other informants, especially parents, and to address 
safeguarding issues. Furthermore, the incidence of self-
harm in people younger than 18 years is particularly high.10
This study is to our knowledge the most detailed analysis 
of the immediate general hospital costs of self-harm in 
England to date, taking account of the use of psychosocial 
assessment and providing different estimates of cost for 
different types of self-harm. Previous analyses2,3 from the 
turn of the millennium have focused on the costs of self-
poisoning alone, including the costs of antidepressant 
overdoses,11 in which hospital costs of tricyclic overdoses 
were significantly greater than those of SSRI overdoses.12 
Analysis of self-poisoning episodes in a small number of 
English hospitals13,14 previously highlighted variability in 
care management with wide differentials in cost per 
episode, for instance ranging from £312 to £577 (not 
including psychosocial assessment; 2016 prices).14 Another 
analysis, rather than estimating actual costs, made use of 
specific NHS Reference cost tariffs for emergency 
medicine to different clinical pathways after paracetamol 
poisoning to estimate UK-wide annual hospital costs to be 
in the region of £51 million.15
Outside of the UK, few detailed studies on the costs of 
all-causes of self-harm are available. In Switzerland, the

1-year costs of all self-harm events at two hospitals in 
Basel in 200316 were estimated. Older age and more lethal 
methods (eg, hanging, drowning or jumping) were 
associated with significantly higher costs, with median 
costs per case of £3437
. A 201217 analysis of self-poisonings 
in a Belgian hospital estimated the mean cost of self-
poisoning to be similar in magnitude to that seen in our 
study, at £810. Mean hospital costs per poisoning (both 
unintentional and intentional) estimated in one hospital 
in Madrid, Spain, also indicated that costs rise with age, 
but no precise median or mean costs per case were

which were self-injury and ten poisonings) were £4142 in 
one hospital in São Paulo, Brazil.19 In the USA, large 
patient and injury databases have also been used to look 
at the costs of self-harm. National level costs for non-fatal 
self-harm events were reported in 2016 to be a mean 
of £6061, but this includes productivity losses in addition 
to medical costs.20 Another US analysis from 2016 has 
estimated the hospitalisation costs per suicide-related 
poisoning and alcohol overdose to be $4129.21 The 
hospital costs estimates reported in international 
literature as well as in this study should be considered 
cautiously from an international perspective as the 
organisation of hospital services delivered for self-harm 
will vary between countries.
To our knowledge, our calculation of the psychosocial 
assessment costs is the first detailed estimate of assessment 
costs in England. NICE guidelines on self-harm 
management included a cost calculation of psychosocial 
assessment based on reference costs (2009–10) of first 
time face-to-face consultations with mental health 
consultants in a community setting.8 Our estimates of 
psychosocial assessment costs were £36 lower for patients 
younger than 18 years (£392 vs £356) and £2 lower for 
adults (£228 vs £226) than the costs provided by NICE after 
inflating to 2013–14 values using the Inflation Hospital 
Community Health Services Index.8 This means that the 
costs of the Oxford model of psychosocial assessment were 
very close to the mean psychosocial assessment costs in 
England in 2013–14 as estimated by NICE, which supports 
the generalisability of the results of the present study.
Although the rate of self-harm in Oxford is somewhat 
lower than in some other centres,1 the pattern of self-
harm in this study is similar in terms of the 
characteristics of patients and methods of self-harm to 
that found in other hospitals in England.22 A large 
observational study23 of self-harm in 32 English hospitals 
in 2010–11 showed that the proportion of self-harm 
patients who were admitted to general hospitals varied 
between 22% and 85% of those presenting and the 
proportion of episodes in which a psychosocial 
assessment was done varied between 22% and 88%. 
Considering these large variations and the recent 
increased tendency to admit self-harm patients to 
hospital and to do psychosocial assessment (as suggested 
in NICE guidelines), we believe that our study provides a 
first reasonable contemporary estimation of the mean 
cost per self-harm episode in England. If we extrapolate 
our findings to England, the estimated costs of self-
harm in general hospitals are £161·8 million per year 
(ie, 200 000 presentations multiplied by £809).
Psychosocial assessment, followed by appropriate 
treatment and care, potentially provides a way of 
reducing the risk of future self-harm24,25 and is therefore 
recommended in NICE clinical guidelines. Using our 
costings, if psychosocial assessment was done for 
every self-harm presentation, this would cost around 
£51 million per year. Further evidence from economic 
evaluation studies is needed to show the potential 
savings that might result from greater use of 
psychosocial assessment after self-harm. Such studies 
are challenging and appropriate study designs should 
be adopted.26
Our estimate of the costs of hospital management of 
self-harm provides fundamental information for future 
economic modelling analyses to evaluate the potential 
costs and benefits of policies for self-harm. These include 
psychosocial assessment, aftercare interventions, and 
prevention initiatives. Evidence from such analyses could 
support policy makers in trying to achieve reduction in 
suicide.27
The strengths of this study include use of a large 
dataset of good data quality, the advanced regression 
modelling approach, and the precision of the reported 
costs of psychosocial assessment. The limitations of 
this study include the lack of a breakdown by mental 
health conditions, the single hospital setting and the 
limitation of its scope to the hospital costs after self-
harm. Future research might explore the medical costs 
throughout the care pathways by including ambulance 
costs, costs borne by the patient and their families, and 
after-care costs in several settings across England. It 
will also be important to use follow-up data for patients 
with self-harm to explore their subsequent use of health 
and social care services, as well as broader outcomes 
such as the effect on their quality of life.
Hospital management of self-harm involves substantial 
costs. According to our findings the mean cost is £809 per 
self-harm episode, including the costs of psychosocial 
assessment. Given the size of the problem of self-harm 
nationally in England this translates into approximately 
£162 million per year from the NHS budget to treat 
people with self-harm presentations to general hospitals. 
This highlights the need for effective methods of 
preventing of self-harm and reducing the extent to which 
it is repeated.
