Abstract
Background
Joint inflammation is the common feature underlying juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Clini-
cians recognize patterns of joint involvement currently not part of the International League of
Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) classification. Using unsupervised machine learning,
we sought to uncover data-driven joint patterns that predict clinical phenotype and disease
trajectories.
Methods and findings
We analyzed prospectively collected clinical data, including joint involvement using a stan-
dard 71-joint homunculus, for 640 discovery patients with newly diagnosed JIA enrolled in a
Canada-wide study who were followed serially for five years, treatment-naïve except for
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and diagnosed within one year of symptom
onset. Twenty-one patients had systemic arthritis, 300 oligoarthritis, 125 rheumatoid factor
(RF)-negative polyarthritis, 16 RF-positive polyarthritis, 37 psoriatic arthritis, 78 enthesitis-
related arthritis (ERA), and 63 undifferentiated arthritis. At diagnosis, we observed global
hierarchical groups of co-involved joints.
To characterize these patterns, we developed sparse multilayer non-negative matrix fac-
torization (NMF). Model selection by internal bi-cross-validation identified seven joint

 patterns at presentation, to which all 640 discovery patients were assigned: pelvic girdle (57
patients), fingers (25), wrists (114), toes (48), ankles (106), knees (283), and indistinct (7).
Patterns were distinct from clinical subtypes (P < 0.001 by χ2 test) and reproducible through
external data set validation on a 119-patient, prospectively collected independent validation
cohort (reconstruction accuracy Q2 = 0.55 for patterns; 0.35 for groups).
Some patients matched multiple patterns. To determine whether their disease outcomes
differed, we further subdivided the 640 discovery patients into three subgroups by degree of
localization—the percentage of their active joints aligning with their assigned pattern: local-
ized (�90%; 359 patients), partially localized (60%–90%; 124), or extended (<60%; 157).
Localized patients more often maintained their baseline patterns (P < 0.05 for five groups by
permutation test) than nonlocalized patients (P < 0.05 for three groups by permutation test)
over a five-year follow-up period.
We modelled time to zero joints in the discovery cohort using a multivariate Cox propor-
tional hazards model considering joint pattern, degree of localization, and ILAR subtype.
Despite receiving more intense treatment, 50% of nonlocalized patients had zero joints at
one year compared to six months for localized patients. Overall, localized patients required
less time to reach zero joints (partial: P = 0.0018 versus localized by log-rank test; extended:
P = 0.0057).
Potential limitations include the requirement for patients to be treatment naïve (except
NSAIDs), which may skew the patient cohorts towards milder disease, and the validation
cohort size precluded multivariate analyses of disease trajectories.
Conclusions
Multilayer NMF identified patterns of joint involvement that predicted disease trajectory in
children with arthritis. Our hierarchical unsupervised approach identified a new clinical fea-
ture, degree of localization, which predicted outcomes in both cohorts. Detailed assessment
of every joint is already part of every musculoskeletal exam for children with arthritis. Our
study supports both the continued collection of detailed joint involvement and the inclusion
of patterns and degrees of localization to stratify patients and inform treatment decisions.
This will advance pediatric rheumatology from counting joints to realizing the potential of
using data available from uncovering patterns of joint involvement.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a heterogeneous childhood disease for which joint
inflammation is the common denominator.
• The current classification system, the International League of Associations for Rheuma-
tology (ILAR) subtypes, categorize patients according to the number of active joints
(four or fewer versus five or more affected joints in the first six months of disease) with
little evidence to support this cut-off.

 • Grouping frequently co-involved joints into joint patterns may help to better classify
patients and predict disease course.
What did the researchers do and find?
• We analyzed baseline joint involvement data from 640 treatment-naïve patients from 16
Canadian centers participating in the Research in Arthritis in Canadian Children,
Emphasizing Outcomes (ReACCh-Out) study between 2005 and 2010.
• We identified seven joint patterns that grouped frequently co-involved joints using mul-
tilayer non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), an unsupervised pattern recognition
technique. We named these patterns as follows: pelvic girdle, fingers, wrists, toes, knees,
ankles, and indistinct.
• These seven patterns described more homogenous groupings of joints than the ILAR
subtypes and further stratified them.
• Throughout disease course, we found that patients with joint involvements largely over-
lapping their baseline patterns, i.e., those having localized involvement, continued to
have the same active joints, whereas patients with nonlocalized involvement did not.
• Patients with localized joint involvement reached zero joint involvement faster than
those with nonlocalized involvement.
What do these findings mean?
• Patterns of joint involvement represent prognostic features that should be incorporated
into a comprehensive JIA disease classification.
• Patients with nonlocalized joint involvement are at high risk of poor outcome.
• Grouping patients by joint pattern and degree of localization may help clinicians tailor
treatments based on predicted disease trajectories.
Introduction
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common chronic inflammatory rheumatic dis-
ease in childhood, characterized by joint inflammation of unknown etiology lasting at least six
weeks starting at <16 years of age. The International League of Associations for Rheumatology
(ILAR) criteria classify JIA into seven subtypes [1].
Clinicians acknowledge that individual joints or groups of joints influence outcome. Dis-
tinct joint involvement patterns such as dactylitis, sacroiliac joint involvement, or tarsitis are
clearly recognized in patients with JIA [1]. However, despite efforts to characterize distinct dis-
ease entities, these patterns remain heterogeneous in clinical presentation and consequently
disease course and response to treatment. In addition, individual joints such as the hip, cervical
spine, ankle, or wrist may be indicators of poor outcome [2–5] and have therefore been

 considered in the 2011 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) treatment recommenda-
tions as indicator joints for poor prognosis [6–8]. However, existing classification subtypes
and treatment recommendations do not take affected joint patterns into account [1,6]. More-
over, these findings only apply to a subset of JIA patients and are based on a small number of
joints [9,10]. A significant gap remains in our understanding of the relationship between pat-
terns of joint involvement and disease outcome.
Systematically collected data from the Research in Arthritis in Canadian Children, Empha-
sizing Outcomes (ReACCh-Out) study have enabled us to address this knowledge gap.
ReACCh-Out is a prospective inception cohort study of children with newly diagnosed JIA
[11] that has rigorously collected detailed longitudinal clinical data, including information
on joint inflammation. A standard 71-joint homunculus precludes the use of traditional statis-
tical—or supervised learning—techniques to associate individual joints, let alone combinations
of joints, to descriptors of outcome in an unbiased manner due to multiple hypothesis testing
in the context of small patient numbers, a common challenge in rare diseases. To address this
challenge, unsupervised learning can help identify a small number of patterns of arthritis in a
principled, logical, and expressive manner, whose outcomes we can then explore. We can
draw from previous successes applying these approaches in JIA analyzing clinical and bio-
marker data [12,13]. These patterns not only provide possible predictive features of outcome
but also help to organize the patients into homologous groups that may underlie further dis-
ease research.
In this study, we pursued a data-driven strategy in a novel data domain, joint involvements,
to identify two easily measurable clinical variables—joint pattern and degree of localization—
in children with newly diagnosed JIA. We then determined the relationship of these measures
to longitudinal outcomes, including pattern stability and response to treatment.
Methods
Our analysis, outlined as a flow chart in S1 Fig, can be divided into the following phases: data
collection and filtering, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and postclustering analysis. As
indicated in our transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prog-
nosis or diagnosis (TRIPOD) checklist (S1 Checklist), our postclustering analysis plan was
developed after we completed the clustering and observed that some patients defied identifica-
tion with a single joint grouping. This observation prompted us to include a variable describ-
ing this in our multivariate prediction model.
Study design
For the discovery cohort, patients enrolled in ReACCh-Out were included if they satisfied the
classification criteria for any of the seven ILAR JIA subtypes [1]. Enrolled patients were
included within one year of JIA diagnosis and were treatment naïve for medications except for
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). ReACCh-Out is a prospective inception
cohort of newly diagnosed patients with JIA recruited between 2005 and 2010 from 16 tertiary
Canadian centers. These 16 centers included 14 academic and two community centers: Royal
Jubilee Hospital, Victoria, British Columbia; BC Children’s Hospital, Vancouver, British
Columbia; Penticton Regional Hospital, Penticton, British Columbia; University of Calgary,
Calgary, Alberta; Alberta Health Services, Edmonton, Alberta; Royal University Hospital, Sas-
katoon, Saskatchewan; Health Sciences Centre, Winnipeg, Manitoba; The Hospital for Sick

The nonoverlapping independent validation cohort comprised prospectively collected
patients with newly diagnosed chronic childhood arthritis and detailed information about
joint involvement recruited between 1980 and 2007 from two tertiary Canadian sites: Royal
University Hospital of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan and Health Sciences Centre of Winnipeg,
Manitoba [14]. These sites were chosen because they had standardized collection of prospec-
tive data by the same personnel over the study timeframe. For this study, all patients were
treatment naïve except for NSAIDs. Prior to the introduction of the ILAR classification crite-
ria, patients in the validation cohort were identified as satisfying ACR criteria for juvenile
rheumatoid arthritis (JRA).
Research ethics boards at each participating center approved the study protocols. Informed
written consent for participation was obtained from parents, and informed consent or assent
was obtained from patients as appropriate.
Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data
For the discovery cohort, detailed demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected
prospectively at study entry using standardized clinical reporting forms. Collected information
included key features of the ILAR classification [1], the ACR pediatric core set measures of dis-
ease activity [15], standard laboratory markers, and physician assessments of global disease
activity. All forms were subsequently validated. Musculoskeletal information for 71 joints as
well as treatment regimens were serially collected at six-month intervals for the first 18 months
and yearly thereafter for five years after study enrollment.
In the validation cohort, the features of the ILAR classification were collected as well as
joint involvements at all subsequent clinical visits.
Hardware and software
All analyses were conducted using R version 3.3.0 (Vienna, Austria) and Python version 3.6
and higher (Wilmington, Delaware, US) on Apple computers running Mac OS X 10.10 and
higher, as well as at supercomputing facilities at the High Performance Facility at SickKids
(Toronto, Ontario, Canada) and the Terrence Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular
Research at the University of Toronto (Toronto, Ontario, Canada).
Joint co-involvements
Initially, joint co-involvements—which describe pairs of joints that are active together—were
analyzed by calculating joint co-involvement frequencies and conditional joint co-involvement
frequencies. A joint co-involvement frequency, P(x,y), for a reference joint x and a co-involved
joint y is the proportion of patients having both joints involved. The conditional joint co-
involvement frequencies, P yjx
ð
Þ ¼ Pðy;xÞ
PðxÞ , are the fraction of all patients with x involved who
also have y involved.
To investigate whether joint co-involvement frequencies were asymmetric, i.e., higher for
joints on the same side of the body, we developed a measure of same-side versus opposite-side
skew in the co-involvement frequencies computed across the discovery cohort. A “joint type”
is the pair of corresponding joints on opposite sides of the body, e.g., the knee joint type con-
sists of the left and right knee joints. To compute skew for a reference joint type x and a co-
involved joint type y, we counted the number of patients for whom a reference joint was paired

 with a co-involved joint on the same side (nsame) and on the opposite side (nopposite) and used
these to compute a z-score to measure skew for the joint type pair by setting z ¼ m� 0:5

that m ¼

. If the joint type pair co-involvement was symmetric,
z would be close to zero, whereas if co-involved joints tended to occur on the same side of the
body, z would be large and positive. To assess the significance of the skew, χ2 tests were con-
ducted using nsame and nopposite under the null hypothesis that both quantities were equal. P
values were translated to false discovery rates (FDRs) to account for multiple hypothesis test-
ing. FDR < 0.1 was considered significant.
Identifying patterns of joint involvement
We selected an analysis strategy suitable for the positive joint counts that would be able to
identify sparse patterns of joint involvement if they were present in the data. Sparse patterns
better support interpretation and application of these patterns by clinicians. Also, we sought a
mixed membership model so that patients could belong to multiple groups. Finally, our pre-
liminary analysis suggested a hierarchical structure to the joint co-involvement patterns, with
some tightly coupled joint groups (e.g., toe joints) that often co-occur along with one or more
broader patterns of co-activation of these tight groups.
As such, we adapted a form of multilayer non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) [16] to
learn hierarchical, sparse representations (S1C Fig). Multilayer NMF progressively applies
NMF to the joint patterns. NMF is a dimensionality reduction method that fits summary indi-
cators or “factors” that group frequently co-involved joints together [17]. Broadly, NMF
decomposes joint involvements X into a basis/loading matrix W, describing the contributions
of joints to factors, and a coefficient/score matrix H that scores patients on factors. Multiplying
these two matrices approximates the input data (X � WH). NMF produces an intuitive parts-
based representation in which reconstructing patient data involves only adding groups of
joints in factors, similar to adding parts of faces (different eyes or noses) to reconstruct facial
representations [17]. Unlike other dimensionality reduction techniques like principal compo-
nent analysis (PCA), NMF constrains the elements of W and H to be positive. This constraint
often causes many elements of the two matrices to be zero, a trend that we supplement by set-
ting small elements to zero (a technique called “sparsifying”), as described in S1 Text. NMF
can be used to cluster patients by interpreting the nonzero elements of H for each patient as
assignments to clusters represented by the factors in W [18].
Multilayer NMF was conducted as described in S1 Text. Briefly, NMF was applied to the
joint involvement data, and W was then sparsified to produce low-level factors that correspond
to tight joint groupings. NMF was then applied to the H matrix to identify tight joint group-
ings that often co-occur; the term “high-level factors” refers to these frequently co-occurring
tight joint groupings. Through matrix multiplication, joint involvements can be recovered
from the high-level factors. “Key joints” for each high-level factor were those appearing with
nonzero contributions. For both the high- and low-level factors, patients were assigned into
patient groups (“[x]”) corresponding to their highest-scoring factor [19].
The degree of overlap was assessed between patient groups at both levels of the analysis.
Patient factor scores were normalized patient-wise to the highest factor score and then z-
score–transformed factor-wise. One-sided z-tests determined which patient groups had higher
scores than expected on individual factors. FDRs were calculated from P values to account for
multiple hypothesis testing. Relationships between patient groups and factors were significant
if their FDR was <0.1.

 Relationships between patient groups and ILAR subtypes
Relationships were visualized between patient groups and ILAR subtypes through a circular
figure built using Circos 0.63 [20]. To identify enriched relationships between patient groups
and ILAR subtypes, a χ2 test was conducted. Relationships were enriched if their standardized
residual was �1.96 (i.e., P < 0.05).
Localization of joint involvements
To describe how closely patients aligned with their associated high-level factors or patient
groups, patients were further stratified by the “degree of localization” of their active joints.
Patients with “localized” involvement had �90% of active joints being key joints in the high-
level factor underlying their patient group. For patients with “partially localized” involvement,
this range was �60% and <90%. All other patients had “extended” involvement. S2 Text
describes how these boundaries were determined.
To determine which patient groups skewed towards any localization, χ2 tests were con-
ducted to compare the distribution of localizations within a single patient group against the
global distribution. P values were Bonferroni-adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing.
Associations of patient groups with treatment decisions
For each medication at six-month and one-year visits, multivariable logistic regression was
conducted to predict medication status as an outcome from both patient groups and degrees
of localization. Model significance was assessed using likelihood-ratio tests. A model for a
medication and visit was significant if P < 0.05 after a Bonferroni adjustment for multiple
hypothesis testing.
Patient group trajectories and disease trajectories
To track how joint involvement changed over subsequent visits, high-level patient factor scores
and patient group assignments were calculated where possible at six-month, one-year,
18-month, two-year, three-year, four-year, and five-year visits. From baseline patient group
assignments and localizations, frequencies of transitioning between two patient groups at any
time between six-month and five-year visits were calculated. Significantly overrepresented
transitions were determined by a 2,000× permutation test.
A multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, as implemented in the survival R pack-
age, version 2.41 [21], was conducted to identify which patient groups, ILAR subtypes, and
degrees of localization experienced zero joint involvement more quickly. The assumption of
proportional hazards was assessed visually and tested using the “cox.zph” function in survival.
Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed and patient groups,
ILAR subtypes, and degrees of localization were compared using log-rank tests.
Validation
To determine whether the identified patterns of joint involvement could generalize beyond the
discovery cohort, validation cohort joint involvement data were projected onto high-level fac-
tors and patient groups. At each level, the same scaling parameters were applied to joint
involvement data or low-level patient factor scores. Patients were assigned to patient groups
based on their highest-scoring high-level factors as above. Patterns of joint involvement were
also identified independently of discovery joint patterns using the multilayer NMF framework
described above.

 Results
Patient characteristics
We included 640 patients with newly diagnosed JIA in the discovery cohort and 119 in the val-
idation cohort. Table 1 outlines demographic data for these cohorts respectively. Discovery
cohort patients were diagnosed at a median age of 7.7 years, with a range of 0.57 to 16.6 years,
whereas validation cohort patients were diagnosed at a younger age (median: 5.7 years; range:
0.5–18 years). The most highly represented subtype in both cohorts was oligoarthritis (discov-
ery: 47%; validation: 56%), and most patients were female (discovery: 65%; validation: 71%).
Joints were co-involved in distinct patterns across the entire discovery cohort
To investigate patterns of joint involvement and co-involvement, we computed overall fre-
quencies of individual joint involvement and pair co-involvement in the discovery cohort. Fig

 1 depicts overall joint involvement frequencies. Knees, ankles, and wrists had the highest rate
of involvement. When we considered conditional co-involvement frequencies partitioned by
side of body (Fig 2), 3,271 of 5,041 (65%) of these probabilities were significant (P < 0.05 after
Bonferroni adjustment). Examining the heat maps for same-side joints in the top-left and bot-
tom-right quadrants, we observed hierarchical patterns of joint co-involvement along the ver-
tical axis. Joints closer on the vertical body axis were generally more often co-involved joints.
For example, index finger joints and middle finger joints were likely to be co-involved. How-
ever, there also appeared to be broad, nonlocal patterns of co-involvement, e.g., finger and toe
joints were frequently co-involved.
In contrast, the heat maps for opposite-side involvement in the top-right and bottom-left
quadrants appeared nearly identical (Frobenius norm = 3.7; P < 0.001 by permutation test),
indicating little proximity preference along the horizontal axis. For example, left index finger
joints were as likely to be co-involved with right middle finger joints as those on the left middle
finger. This observation was consistent with widespread symmetric joint involvement in JIA.
Asymmetric joint involvement is associated with more severe forms of JIA [22]. To study
the prevalence of asymmetric co-involvements, we determined which joint types were more

 likely to be co-involved with joints on the same side of the body. Consistent with our initial
impression of Fig 2, and different than what we expected based on previous reports in JIA, we
found few statistically significant asymmetric joints: only ankle, midfoot, and subtalar joints
(with ankle: χ2 = 14, PFDR = 0.0097; with subtalar joints: χ2 = 11, PFDR = 0.048) had statistically
significant same-side co-involvement (S2 Fig).
Multilayer NMF identified seven distinct patterns of joint involvement
To characterize hierarchical patterns of joint co-involvements, we applied multilayer NMF on
discovery cohort joint involvements to identify groups of frequently co-involved joints. Con-
ventional NMF identified 19 low-level groupings (or factors)—<1–19> (S6A Fig)—of verti-
cally proximal joints, which S3 Text details. Consistent with the pairwise analysis (S2 Fig),
most factors grouped joints of the same type (S6A Fig), with exceptions being pairs of groups
containing only ankles and subtalar joints, only a single knee, and one group containing joints
from the index (second) and middle (third) fingers on the right side. We named these 19
factors (“<x>”) as follows: <1 TMJs>, <2 shoulders>, <3 sternoclavicular joints>, <4
elbows>, <5 thumbs>, <6 sacroiliac joints>, <7 MCPs>, <8 second–third fingers>, <9

DIPs>, <15 subtalar and midfoot>, <16 grand toes>, <17 ankles>, <18 toe IPs>, and <19
MTPs>. Multiple low-level joint groups were significantly co-involved (S7A Fig), suggesting a
hierarchical structure not captured by low-level factors.
To identify this hierarchical structure to the co-involvements, we conducted a second
round of conventional NMF on low-level patient scores, which identified seven groupings of
groups we deem “high-level factors”, <A–G>. S3 Text describes the process of deriving these
high-level factors. As expected from our preliminary investigations (Fig 2), each high-level fac-
tor combined low-level factors into broader, symmetric groupings covering partially overlap-
ping areas of the vertical body axis (S6 Fig). We named these high-level factors <A pelvic
girdle>, <B fingers>, <C wrists>, <D toes>, <E ankles>, <F knees>, and <G sternoclavi-
cular joints>. Finger distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints distinguished <B fingers> from <C
wrists>, as <B fingers> skewed towards finger DIPs and <C wrists> towards shoulders and
elbows. <A pelvic girdle> included sacroiliac joints and/or hips, and <E ankles> included
ankles, subtalar, and midfoot joints.
We classified each patient into one of seven groups (“[x]”) corresponding to the high-level
factors based on their highest-scoring high-level factor. Fig 3 shows joint involvement

 frequencies in each patient group, and S8 Fig depicts individual joint involvements for
patients. Key joints—outlined in Fig 3—were those with nonzero weights in the corresponding
high-level factors (S6 Fig). Non-key joints were rarely involved except in [G indistinct] and for
some finger/wrist involvement in [D toes], suggesting that most patients had what we deem
localized involvement; in other words, most or all of their joints overlapped with key joints.
Overall, these patient groups corresponded to logical patterns of joint involvement reported at
the bedside [23].
Patterns of joint involvement subdivided the ILAR subtypes
Six of seven patient groups associated with at least one ILAR subtype, despite patient groups
comprising different stratifications of patients from the ILAR subtypes (χ2 = 313; P < 0.001).
Conversely, six of seven ILAR subtypes associated with patient groups. More opaque ribbons
in the Circos figure (Fig 4), linking patients common to patient groups and ILAR subtypes,
represent these enriched associations encompassing more patients than expected through
standardized residuals from the above χ2 test (S2 Table). These standardized residuals quantify
how far the number of patients shared by a patient group and ILAR subtype deviated from
expectation. Children in [A pelvic girdle] associated with enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA), [B
fingers] with rheumatoid factor (RF)-negative polyarthritis; [C wrists] with systemic arthritis
and both RF-positive and negative polyarthritis; [D toes] with RF-negative polyarthritis, psori-
atic arthritis, and ERA; and [F knees] with oligoarthritis.
Some patients had nonlocalized joint involvement
Although the high-level groupings completely encapsulated joint involvements for most
patients (56%), a small group of patients (25%) had more non-key joints involved than key
joints (S9 Fig). We deemed these patients as having extended involvement. Patients with 90%
of their joints as key were localized, and those with 60% to 90% were partially localized. S4
Text describes how we determined these thresholds. To determine the clinical significance of
these subcategories, we compared the clinical attributes of patients therein.
Patient groups with significantly skewed distributions of localizations included [C wrists],
[D toes], [F knees], and [G indistinct] (χ2 � 21.5; P < 0.001; S9C Fig and S3 Table). Patients in
[G indistinct] skewed towards extended involvement, [C wrists] towards partially localized
involvement, and [D toes] towards both partially localized and extended involvement. Chil-
dren in [F knees] skewed towards localized involvement.
Treatment decisions were associated with degrees of localization
To determine whether treatment decisions were associated with patient groups and degrees of
localization, we conducted multivariable logistic regression. S10A Fig depicts the number of
patients in each group and localization with medication data at six-month and one-year visits.
S10B Fig depicts the proportion of patients in each patient group, divided by localization, who
received biologics, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), joint injections, and
systemic corticosteroids prior to these visits. Patient groups differed by DMARD usage, with
higher than expected utilization in children in [C wrists] and [E ankles] with localized involve-
ment and [F knees] with partially localized and extended involvement, and lower than
expected utilization in [F knees] with localized involvement (S4 Table). In terms of systemic
corticosteroid usage, patients in [F knees] with localized involvements were less likely to
receive such treatment at six-month visits. Therefore, patient joint group and localization
influenced treatment.

 Patient groups remained stable throughout initial disease course
To observe how the data-driven joint patterns evolved throughout disease course, we traced
patient group assignments longitudinally. Fig 5 depicts transition probabilities from baseline
patient groups, divided by degree of localization, to groups at any visit up to five years. While
patients often transitioned to zero joint involvement, several transitions were enriched
(P < 0.05; Holm-Bonferroni–adjusted), with little movement between patient groups given
the lack of filled circles outside the diagonals. Among patients with localized involvements (Fig
5A), patients in [A pelvic girdle], [B fingers], [D toes], [E ankles], and [F knees] remained in
their own patient group. Even among patients with partially localized involvements (Fig 5B),

 patients in [A pelvic girdle] often transitioned to zero joint involvement, whereas patients in
[B fingers] and [C wrists] transitioned to or remained [C wrists]. Patients in [E ankles] often
remained in the same patient group. Among patients with extended involvement (Fig 5C),
patients in [A pelvic girdle], [E ankles], and [G indistinct] often remained in their respective
patient groups.
Localizations predicted time to zero joint involvement
Having observed a strong tendency for some groups towards zero joint involvement (disease
control/inactive disease), we asked whether the groups differed by the rate in which they
achieved this outcome. We constructed a Cox proportional hazards model predicting time to
zero joint involvement from patient groups, localizations, and ILAR subtypes. The resulting
model did not deviate from the proportional hazards assumption (χ2 = 22.9, P = 0.062) and
identified localizations and ILAR subtypes that reached zero joint involvement at different
rates than others (R2 = 0.093, P < 0.001). At least half of the patients followed in [F knees]
reached this endpoint by six months, and [A pelvic girdle], [C wrists], [D toes], and [E ankles]
reached it by one year (S11A Fig). In contrast, patients in [B fingers] reached this endpoint
after 18 months, and those in [G indistinct] reached it after three years. Localization was espe-
cially important because patients with localized involvement achieved this outcome faster than
patients with partial involvement (HR = 0.70, Z = −3.1, P = 0.0018) and extended involvement

 (HR = 0.63, Z = −2.8, P = 0.0057) (Fig 5D). Among diagnoses, patients with RF-positive poly-
arthritis (HR = 0.42, Z = 2.4, P = 0.016) and undifferentiated arthritis (HR = 0.64, Z = −2.8,
P = 0.0059) reached this outcome more slowly. S5 Table contains additional statistics for the
Cox proportional hazards model.
Patient groups generalized to an independent validation cohort
To determine whether factors and patient groups were generalizable beyond the discovery
cohort, we projected an independent validation cohort of JIA patients to the joint patterns.
These patients’ joint involvements were reconstructed by low-level factors with Q2 = 0.81,
high-level factors with Q2 = 0.55, and patient groups with Q2 = 0.48 (S1 Table), comparing
favorably against ILAR subtypes, with Q2 = 0.43. Projected patient groups presented with simi-
lar joint involvement frequencies (S12 Fig). We then calculated de novo factors and patient
groups, which we detail in S4 Text. Validation joint involvements were reconstructed by low-
level factors with Q2 = 0.84, high-level factors with Q2 = 0.55, and patient groups with Q2 =
0.35. De novo factors described similar joint groupings as discovery factors (S13C, S13F and
S13G Fig).
We then asked whether the projected groups could also predict time to zero joint involve-
ment. Considering individual univariate models due to limited power, patient groups (χ2 = 17,
P = 0.0072) and localizations (χ2 = 8.9, P = 0.012; S14 Fig) themselves predicted this outcome.
Patients with extended involvement took significantly longer to reach zero joint involvement
than patients with localized involvement (HR = 0.53, Z = −2.5, P = 0.011).
Discussion
We explored patterns of articular involvement in JIA using unsupervised data-driven pattern
recognition techniques. We initially observed joints co-occurring in logical and localized
groupings without same-side skewing (Figs 1 and 2 and S2 Fig). To better understand these
signals in a clinically applicable manner, we conducted a modified version of multilayer NMF,
identifying seven high-level groupings of joints (S6 Fig and Fig 3) describing arthritis foci
anchored by distinct subsets of joints. The resulting seven patient groups subdivided the ILAR
subtypes into distinct subgroups based on patterns of arthritis (Fig 4). Patients with localized
involvement often remained in the same patient group after baseline visit (Fig 5A, 5B and 5C)
and reached zero joint involvement faster than patients with nonlocalized involvement (Fig
5D). These patterns generalized to an independent validation cohort, supporting their applica-
bility beyond the discovery cohort (S12 Fig and S13 Fig).
Our study is the first to provide a detailed, data-driven description of heterogeneously co-
involved joints in JIA. Previous studies have focused on individual joints [2–8] in specific indi-
vidual ILAR subtypes [9,10], whereas we identified joint groupings in a data-driven fashion
independently of these ILAR subtypes. For example, our approach identified differences in
presentation among patients with polyarticular involvement, separating these patients based
on joint patterns. For example, the small joints of the fingers in [B fingers] and [C wrists] were
clearly distinct from the small joints of the toes in [D toes]. The composition of patient groups
in RF-negative polyarthritis further supported this distinction, with this ILAR subtype associ-
ating with [B fingers], [C wrists], and [D toes]. [B fingers] and [C wrists] may represent a spec-
trum of disease phenotypes (S7 Fig) that may transition between each other during disease
evolution (Fig 5). Wrist involvement has been associated with poor prognosis and decisions to
treat more aggressively [6]. Our results reflected this trend as patients in [C wrists] had less
defined disease trajectories and longer times to zero joint involvement (S11 Fig) despite more
commonly receiving DMARDs and systemic glucocorticoids. Similar findings were observed

 in patients in [B fingers] which tended to transition into [C wrists], with higher use of (bio-
logic) DMARDs and systemic glucocorticoids at diagnosis. These findings were notable as
patients in [B fingers] tended to transition to [C wrists] when they had partially localized
involvement.
The stability of the patient groups for up to five years after diagnosis supports how mean-
ingful these patterns are. As patients lose active joints over the course of treatment, we
expected their joint patterns to shift as patient factor scores represent weighted sums of indi-
vidual joints. With fewer active joints, we expected patterns to become more sensitive to the
specific joints involved. However, patients remaining in their same groups in at least one sub-
sequent visit suggested that patients with residual joint involvement had it in their group’s key
joints. Therefore, joint patterns may represent robust core groupings of joints much like the
indicator joints of poor outcome [2–7].
Our study is also among the first to identify the degree of active joint localization with out-
comes through an easily measurable clinical variable, the degree of localization. Patients had
worse disease outcomes if their active joints did not align strictly with a single pattern. This
has been instinctively recognized at the bedside by clinicians, as this aspect has clearly influ-
enced treatment decisions (S4 Table and S10 Fig), but is not included in any clinical guidelines.
Furthermore, classifying patients by the degree of localization predicted disease course and
time to zero joint involvement. For patients with recognizable patterns of joint involvement,
treatment decisions appear effective. However, patients with partially localized or extended
joint involvement had the poorest outcomes, taking a longer time to reach zero joint involve-
ment despite receiving stronger medications (e.g., more DMARDs). Patients with nonlocalized
joint involvement may therefore represent a high-risk group who require early aggressive
therapy.
Our pattern recognition approach is well suited for analyzing joint involvements. Factors
supported signals that were apparent based on overall co-involvements. Low-level factors
grouped knees, subtalar joints, and midfoot joints on separate sides of the body into separate
factors, demonstrating that our approach identifies both asymmetrical and symmetrical pat-
terns of arthritis. As our approach identified patterns with little overlap outside the fingers,
patient groups described clinically homogeneous entities. Extending NMF into a multilayer
approach bears some similarity to other hierarchical modelling techniques such as deep auto-
encoders [24], in which each successive layer identifies increasingly broad representations of
the data, or Gaussian process latent variable models [25]. However, multilayer NMF provides
directly interpretable latent representations. This representation differs from PCA, which pro-
duces patterns that are orthogonal to each other, a feature with implications with respect to
joint involvements. Furthermore, PCA patterns are less intuitive as joints contribute both posi-
tively and negatively to them. To reconstruct a patient’s joint involvements, we would have to
add and subtract groups of joints, whereas with NMF, we would only add groups of joints.
Our study has a number of limitations. First, both discovery and validation cohorts were
based on sample sizes of convenience. Because discovering joint patterns involved an unsuper-
vised analysis, a priori power analyses were not done. However, the proximity of joints within
patterns along the vertical axis and our ability to identify useful clinical measures demon-
strated the potential of conducting such an analysis retrospectively. Secondly, the small size of
the validation cohort limited our ability to test our findings in a multivariate model in a valida-
tion cohort, although we successfully validated our predictors in univariate tests. Furthermore,
our validation cohort strongly supported these clinical measures, demonstrating that this con-
cern is one of statistical power rather than approach. Lastly, we required patients to be treat-
ment naïve except NSAIDs, which may have potentially skewed our patient cohorts towards
individuals with milder forms of disease.

 The identified joint patterns appear to have important prognostic implications. They are
conceptually simple to apply at the bedside as they represent an easily computed weighted sum
of active joints. Further classifying patients by the degree of localization may help clinicians
further tailor treatment decisions as patients with less strongly defined phenotypes may
require early aggressive therapy. Patterns of joint involvement may be among key components
of a new disease classification for JIA in addition to other data domains, including antinuclear
antibody (ANA) status [26], biological measures [13], and other musculoskeletal features such
as enthesitis. Beyond JIA, our approach may be a transferrable template for application in
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthropathies (SpAs). Previous efforts in RA have
attempted to define a representative pattern of “core joints” as indicators instead of using the
full complement of joints [27,28]. This reductionist approach still counts joints. Alternatively,
utilizing the rich data for pattern recognition may identify predictors of outcome.
Using multilayer NMF, we identified patterns of joint involvement predictive of disease tra-
jectory in children with arthritis. Our results are consistent with previous observations point-
ing to key individual joints as predictors of poor outcome. Our hierarchical unsupervised
learning approach allowed us to identify a new clinical variable, localization of joint involve-
ment, as a key feature associated with poor outcomes in both our discovery and validation
cohorts. Detailed bedside assessment of every joint is already part of every musculoskeletal
exam for children with arthritis. Our study supports not only the continued collection of
detailed information about joint involvement but also the inclusion of these patterns together
with localization data (i.e., how closely affected children fit these patterns) to stratify patients
and inform treatment decisions. Our findings will move the field of pediatric rheumatology
out of infancy, from joint counts to realizing the potential of using data available from patterns
of joints involvement.
