Abstract
Mosaic truncating mutations in the protein phosphatase, Mg2+/Mn2+-dependent, 1D (PPM1D) gene have recently been 
reported with a statistically significantly greater frequency in lymphocyte DNA from ovarian cancer case patients compared 
with unaffected control patients. Using massively parallel sequencing (MPS) we identified truncating PPM1D mutations 
in 12 of 3236 epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) case patients (0.37%) but in only one of 3431 unaffected control patients 
(0.03%) (P = .001). All statistical tests were two-sided. A combination of Sanger sequencing, pyrosequencing, and MPS data 
suggested that 12 of the 13 mutations were mosaic. All mutations were identified in post-chemotherapy treatment blood 
samples from case patients (n = 1827) (average 1234 days post-treatment in carriers) rather than from cases collected 
pretreatment (less than 14 days after diagnosis, n = 1384) (P = .002). These data suggest that PPM1D variants in EOC cases are 
primarily somatic mosaic mutations caused by treatment and are not associated with germline predisposition to EOC.

T
wo studies have recently reported truncating mutations in the 
protein phosphatase, Mg2+/Mn2+-dependent, 1D gene (PPM1D) 
(HGNC:9277) in lymphocyte DNA from ovarian cancer patients 
(frequency = 1.1%-1.5%) (1,2). Similar mutations were very rare in 
unaffected control patients (frequency = 0.017%-0.11%, respec-
tively). Sequencing data indicated that these mutations may be 
because of somatic mosaicism rather than being present in the 
germline (1,2); in most instances, mutations were not present at 
a 1:1 ratio with the consensus copy of PPM1D, as expected in ger-
mline heterozygous patients., nor were mutations present in the 
ovarian tumor tissue from patients with lymphocyte DNA muta-
tions. It has been suggested that because these mutations are 
present in lymphocyte DNA, they confer susceptibility to ovarian 
cancer and so may be important in the clinical management of 
women through genetic risk prediction and prevention strate-
gies (1–3). However, as previous studies were retrospective it is 
possible that somatic mosaic mutations were the result of treat-
ment in case patients rather than being present before diagnosis.
We have sequenced the 370 
bp region (exon 6) of PPM1D, 
where mutations are clustered, in 3374 epithelial ovarian can-
cer (EOC) case patients and 3487 unaffected control patients 
from the nine different, previously published case-control stud-
ies (Supplementary Table 1, available online) (4,5). Case patients 
were enriched for the serous histological subtype of EOC, which 
is the most common subtype, and/or a family history of ovarian 
cancer. Eighty-nine percent of the case patients were negative for 
BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, and one study was unscreened. All 
studies had ethics committee approval, and all patients provided 
informed consent (Supplementary Table 2, available online).
We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) enrichment to 
amplify the target region of PPM1D using Fluidigm access array as 
previously described (6), followed by 100 
bp paired-end sequencing, 
using the Illumina HiSeq2000/HiScan (Supplementary Methods 
and Supplementary Table 3, available online). Burrows-Wheeler 
Aligner (BWA) (7) was used for sequencing read alignment against 
the human genome reference sequence (hg19). The Genome 
Analysis Toolkit (GATK) (8) was used for base quality-score rec-
alibration, local insertion/deletion (indel) realignment, and sub-
stitution/indel discovery. After quality control filtering, 3236 case 
patients and 3431 control patients with greater than 80% of tar-
get bases being sequenced to a depth of 15X were included in the 
final analysis. The average coverage of the target region screened 
at 15X depth for the 6669 samples was 98.4%. To detect mosaic 
variants with a low frequency, a relatively high depth is required. 
In our data, 95% of target bases had greater than 50X depth and 
86% of bases had greater than 100X depth (Supplementary Table 4, 
available online). All variants with an alternate allele frequency 
of 5% or higher were analyzed further. Where we found evidence 
of potentially deleterious truncating PPM1D mutations, we per-
formed Sanger sequencing to confirm the presence of the muta-
tion and the ratio of the normal and mutant alleles. All tests of 
statistical significance were two-sided, and the cutoff for statisti-
cal significance was a P value of less than .05.
T
welve truncating variants (0.37%) in PPM1D were identified 
in case patients with one truncating variant (0.03%) identified 
in a control (P = .001) (Table 1). Further investigation revealed 
the control had a prior history of breast cancer. All mutations 
in case patients were from patients for whom blood samples 
had been drawn after treatment (n = 1827) compared with case 
patients drawn pretreatment (n = 1384) (P = .002). The average 
time to blood draw in carriers was 1234 days postdiagnosis. We 
used 14 days after diagnosis as the threshold for being untreated 
as the majority of patients start platinum-based chemotherapy 
two to four weeks after diagnosis (9,10). Both massively parallel 
sequencing (MPS) and Sanger sequencing indicated that all but 
one (12 of 13) of the PPM1D mutations were mosaic; the alter-
nate allele frequency in MPS was less for the mutant allele (aver-
age = 27.6%, range = 14.6–45.3). This was specific to PPM1D; for 
heterozygous variants identified in 18 other genes in the same 
samples, the average alternate allele frequency was 49.4% (P < 
.001 for difference with PPM1D variants) (Figure 1 and Table 1; 
Supplementary Figures 1 and 2, available online).
Neither of these sequencing approaches is highly quantita-
tive; our MPS analysis of other candidate genes in the 3236 case 
patients and 3431 control patients found multiple genetic variants 
that deviate from a 50% alternate allele frequency that showed 
no evidence of mosaicism by Sanger sequencing (Supplementary 
Figures 3 and 4, available online). Therefore, we also used pyrose-
quencing to more accurately determine the alternate allele 
frequencies of six of the PPM1D mutations with MPS alternate 
allele frequencies greater than 25% (Supplementary Methods, 
Supplementary Table 5, and Supplementary Figure 1, available 
online). Pyrosequencing indicated that PPM1D mutant alleles 
were present at statistically significant lower alternate allele 
frequencies than heterozygous variants in other genes for the 
same samples (P = .009) (Figure 1). Together, the three methods 
confirmed that five out of six PPM1D variants with MPS alternate 
allele frequencies of 25% to 45% also appear to be mosaic and 
not germline heterozygous mutations (Table 1; Supplementary 
Figures 1 and 2, available online). The variant in Case 2, which 
had the highest MPS alternate allele frequency of 45.3%, did not 
show strong evidence of being mosaic with any method.
In addition to the protein truncating variants, we identified 
eight different nonprotein truncating variants (6 missense and 2 
synonymous changes) in 28 individuals and confirmed all vari-
ants by Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Table 6, available 
online). There was no evidence that any of these variants were 
mosaic from the MPS data or Sanger sequencing. Five of the 
variants were previously identified changes with assigned refer-
ence single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs) numbers.
The observation of mosaic protein truncating variants is con-
sistent with the data presented in the two published studies 
that also suggest PPM1D mutations in EOC cases are mosaic (1,2). 
However, neither of these studies stratified mutation carriers by 
treatment status (pre- or post-treatment) and both publications 
suggested that these variants confer susceptibility to ovarian can-
cer. Ruark et al. estimated that the relative risk of ovarian cancer in 
PPM1D mutations carriers was 12 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.3 
to 30) (1), which is similar to the relative risk of ovarian cancer asso-
ciated with BRCA2 gene mutations (11,12). However, in our study, 
none of the PPM1D mutations were identified in case patients 
from whom blood (and lymphocyte DNA) was taken prior to dis-
ease treatment. This suggests that PPM1D mutations are caused by 
the treatment rather than being present before diagnosis and are 
therefore unlikely to be associated with susceptibility to ovarian 
cancer. This is supported by the findings of Akbari et al., who only 
identified PPM1D mutations in post-treatment case patients (2).
If PPMID mutations do not predispose to ovarian cancer, as 
our data suggest, then their clinical significance is less certain. 
Data from Akbari and colleagues suggest that PPMID mutations 
are associated with poorer outcome (2,13). However, the number 
of carriers in our study was too small to evaluate association with 
survival time and we are unable to confirm or refute this finding. 
If PPM1D mosaic mutations have a clinically significant affect 
on survival, this may explain the differences in mutation fre-
quency between previous reports and our study (Supplementary

Table 7, available online). Ascertainment of post-treatment cases 
to our studies was generally some time after diagnosis (median 
18 months) and would have been biased to genotypes associated 
with better survival (Supplementary Figure 5, available online). 
Alternatively, we propose that chemotherapy damages the DNA 
and clones of cells with mutations may be more common imme-
diately after treatment than some years later.
PPM1D-truncating mutations have been identified in 0.26% 
of breast cancer case patients (1). We identified one mosaic 
PPM1D mutation in a control patient who had a previous his-
tory of breast cancer and three years of Tamoxifen treatment. 
Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator and would 
be expected to have a different mechanism than platinum-based 
chemotherapy, which is standardly used in ovarian cancer. Our 
data would suggest that a similar investigation of PPM1D muta-
tions and treatment in breast cancer is required.
One of the limitations of our study is the lack of detailed 
treatment data; however, the treatment for ovarian cancer at 
the time of these study collections was fairly standard. In all 
the case patients with clearly mosaic PPM1D variants, blood was 
drawn more than 300 days after diagnosis; therefore altering the 
threshold of greater than 14 days for treatment would not have 
affected the number of carriers. The small number of mutation 
carriers is another limitation of this study; a larger analysis of 
post-treatment case patients would be required to identify addi-
tional carriers to further examine survival associated with the 
presence of PPM1D mutations.
In summary, this study suggests that truncating variants in 
PPM1D in EOC case patients are mainly somatic mosaic muta-
tions related to treatment and so are not likely to be associated 
with germline predisposition to EOC.

Figure 1. Alternate allele frequency of PPM1D and other variants for the 13 samples with PPM1D truncating variants. A) Alternate allele frequency data from massively 
parallel sequencing. For the PPM1D variants, the frequency for each sample was graphed. For the other variants in 18 genes, the average of all identified variants in each 
individual, after homozygous variants were removed (alt freq >85%), was graphed. B) Alternate allele frequency data from pyro-sequencing for six cases with massively 
parallel sequencing alternate allele frequencies higher than 25%. For the PPM1D variants, the data from three to six replicates for each sample were averaged. Each of 
the six cases was heterozygous for either the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) BARD1 c.1134C>G or BRIP1 c.2637A>G. The data from three to six replicates of the 
control single-nucleotide polymorphism for each sample was averaged. Paired t tests were used to obtain two tailed P values.
