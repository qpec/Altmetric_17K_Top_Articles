Abstract. In this paper, I have summarized the experimental and largely clinical evidence that implicates aluminum as a
primary etiological factor in Alzheimer’s disease. The unequivocal neurotoxicity of aluminum must mean that when brain
burdens of aluminum exceed toxic thresholds that it is inevitable that aluminum contributes toward disease. Aluminum acts
as a catalyst for an earlier onset of Alzheimer’s disease in individuals with or without concomitant predispositions, genetic
or otherwise. Alzheimer’s disease is not an inevitable consequence of aging in the absence of a brain burden of aluminum.

EVIDENCE NOW POINTS TO ALUMINUM
AS A CONTRIBUTORY FACTOR IN ALL
FORMS OF ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE
Aluminum is unquestionably neurotoxic [1] and
it is accepted as the cause of encephalopathies in,
for example, individuals undergoing renal dialysis
[2] and similarly in individuals who have received
aluminum-based prostheses [3]. There are myriad
ways by which aluminum can exert toxicity; its
Al3+(aq) ion is highly biologically reactive, but to
do so and thereby bring about change in a bio-
chemical system, the aluminum content of any
compartment, such as a tissue, must achieve a toxic
threshold or burden [4]. However, aluminum-induced
encephalopathiesarenotAlzheimer’sdisease,though
they may share some similar neuropathological
hallmarks [5]; they are acute conditions whereas
Alzheimer’s disease might now be considered

as an acute response to chronic intoxication by
aluminum [1].
WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT CAUSES
ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE
While the causes of Alzheimer’s disease remain
unknown, we do know that the neuropathology of
Alzheimer’s disease, if not the disease per se, and
specifically in relation to the deposition of amyloid-�
and tau can be reproduced in transgenic animal mod-
els [6]. We also know that the addition of aluminum
to feed or water exacerbates the many symptoms of
Alzheimer’s disease in these animal models [7, 8].
WHAT ARE THE PERTINENT RISK
FACTORS FOR ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE?
In the majority of individuals, aging is perhaps
the single most important risk factor for the devel-
opment of Alzheimer’s disease [9] and similarly,
aging is also the most critical criterion in the

accumulation of aluminum in human brain tissue
[10]. Neurons have been described as the ‘quintessen-
tial immortal cell line’, and it is their longevity which
predisposes them to accumulate aluminum over time
[4]. There are various intraneuronal pools, for exam-
ple, citrate, ATP, glutamic acid, and the nucleic
acids of the nucleus, where aluminum could remain
benign and accumulate over time before at some point
the biologically-reactive Al3+(aq) exceeds a critical
threshold and begins to exert toxicity [10].
Mutations in the metabolism and processing
of the amyloid-� protein precursor (A�PP) and
related biochemistry are significant risk factors for
Alzheimer’s disease [11, 12]. These genetic predis-
positions form the basis of a diagnosis of familial
Alzheimer’s disease which is invariably an early
onset form of the disease. We have recently com-
pleted the first ever study on the aluminum content
of brain tissue from donors who died with a diag-
nosis of familial Alzheimer’s disease [13]. The data,
supported by complementary imaging using fluores-
cence microscopy [14], revealed some of the highest
concentrations of aluminum ever measured in human
brain tissue. These seminal findings suggest that
A�PP and mutations associated with its metabolism
and enzymatic processing predispose individuals to
a more rapid accumulation and/or longer retention
of aluminum in brain tissue. For example, one or
more of these mutations may result in the enhanced
absorption of aluminum across the gastrointestinal
tract in individuals with familial Alzheimer’s dis-
ease, as has already been shown in individuals with
Down’s syndrome (Trisomy 21) [15] and individuals
with late-onset or sporadic Alzheimer’s disease [16].
We know that within the non-Alzheimer’s disease
population that there can be an order of magnitude
difference in the gastrointestinal absorption of alu-
minum [17]. Similar differences may also exist in
the excretion of aluminum from the body and these
differences may be genetically determined and may
even be related to the metabolism and/or process-
ing of A�PP and its numerous metabolic products
including amyloid-�.
There are occasional cases of Alzheimer’s disease
with an early onset, for example, individuals in their
fifties, where there are no known genetic predisposi-
tions. We have described several such cases in which
the affected individuals had been subjected to envi-
ronmental [14, 18] or occupational exposure [19] to
high levels of aluminum over extended time periods.
Postmortem analyses of their brain tissues revealed
very high levels of aluminum. In these cases of early
onset and particularly aggressive Alzheimer’s dis-
ease, without any known genetic predispositions, it
was concluded that it was inevitable that aluminum
contributed to disease etiology.
WHAT PROTECTS AGAINST
ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE?
While we do not know the cause of Alzheimer’s
disease and we do not have any effective therapies
to treat the disease, there are a number of ‘environ-
mental’ indices which are known to influence the
incidence and progression of Alzheimer’s disease.
For example, the incidence of Alzheimer’s disease is
higher in females [20] and the onset and progression
of Alzheimer’s disease may be delayed by physical
exercise [21]. Aluminum as an etiological factor in
Alzheimer’s disease links the two in that perspiration
is a major route of excretion of aluminum from the
body[22].Intheabsenceofphysicalexercise,women
produce only half the volume of perspiration as men
and so may be predisposed to the retention of alu-
minum in their tissues. In both sexes, physical exer-
cise can increase the perspiration volume many times
and so improve the excretion of aluminum from the
body. Could exercise-induced improvements in the
excretion of aluminum from the body be significant
in the benefits of exercise in Alzheimer’s disease?
Epidemiologicaldatahavebeenequivocalinestab-
lishing a relationship between the aluminum content
of drinking water and the incidence of Alzheimer’s
disease. However, research has shown a significant
protective effect of silicon in drinking water, irre-
spective of the aluminum content, with higher silicon
reducing the incidence of Alzheimer’s disease [23].
In addition, clinical trials involving only a small num-
ber of participants have shown that regular drinking
of a silicon-rich mineral water helps to remove alu-
minumfromthebodyofindividualswithAlzheimer’s
disease [24, 25]. For 20% of such individuals, the
lowering of the body burden of aluminum following
drinkingasilicon-richmineralwaterforjust12weeks
produced clinically significant improvements in their
cognitive function [25]. The potential benefits of sil-
icon in Alzheimer’s disease can only be explained if
aluminum has a role to play in the disease.
SUMMARY
Aging is the major risk factor for Alzheimer’s dis-
ease though the advent of Alzheimer’s disease within

a normal human lifespan is suggested to be brought
about through human exposure to aluminum. Essen-
tially without aluminum in brain tissue there would
be no Alzheimer’s disease. There are a number of
predispositions to the development of Alzheimer’s
disease, involving both environmental and genetic
factors, and each of these acts to increase the alu-
minum content of brain tissue at specific periods in
an individual’s life. This interplay between environ-
mental and genetic factors explains both early and
late onset disease, in each case the catalyst for the dis-
ease is always the brain aluminum content and how
robustly an individual’s brain responds or copes with
this aluminum burden.
