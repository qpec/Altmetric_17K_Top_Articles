IMPORTANCE Determining the national epidemiologic trends of chemical ocular burns can
assist physicians and policy makers in appropriate allocation of resources for treatment and
prevention.
OBJECTIVE To describe the epidemiologic trends and risk factors for chemical burns of the eye.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Between August 1, 2015, and April 25, 2016, data from
the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample were analyzed from January 1, 2010, through
December 31, 2013. A sample of 900 emergency departments (EDs) across the United States
was used. Patients presenting to EDs with a diagnosis of alkali or acid ocular burn, chemical
conjunctivitis, or a combination of nonspecific ocular chemical burn and chemical poisoning
or toxic effects were eligible for inclusion. Injured patients’age, sex, primary health care
insurance, income quartile, and other demographics were described. A subset consisting of
those injuries identified as alkaline or acidic burns was further characterized.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Age-specific rates of ED presentation for chemical ocular
burn injuries, independent factors associated with all, alkali, and acid injuries, and total
ED-associated charges.
RESULTS From January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2013, a total of 144 149 chemical ocular
burns were diagnosed at EDs nationwide. Men represented 56.6% of all cases (n = 81 496).
Median age was 32 years, with female patients presenting at a younger age than male
patients (median of 32 vs 34 years; P < .001). Injury rates were highest among children aged 1
to 2 years (28.61 and 23.49 injuries per 100 000 population, respectively). Adults aged
between 18 and 64 years also have these injuries at an increased rate, although this rate was
half that of infants (mean, 13.28 per 100 000 population). Alkali injuries were more common
than acid injuries (53.6% [n = 9137; 95% CI, 51.6%-56.0%] vs 46.4% [n = 7909; 95% CI,
44.0%-48.9%]), and all chemical eye injuries most commonly occur in residential locations
(10.3% [n = 14 772]; 95% CI, 9.6%-10.9%) and among individuals in the first and second
(lowest and second-lowest) income quartiles (�$48 749) (56.0% [n = 80 691]; 95% CI,
54.4%-57.7%). Injuries most commonly occurred among those who had private health care
insurance (31.9% [n = 45 900]; 95% CI, 30.9%-32.9%), and occurred more in the South
(36.8% [n = 53 008]; 95% CI, 34.6%-39.1%). Emergency department charges due to these
injuries totaled $106.7 million.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Young children represent the single highest-risk group for
ocular chemical injuries. Education and other interventions concerned with preventing these
injuries will be most effective if used accordingly.

C
hemical burns to the eye or ocular adnexa represent a
serious form of injury with potentially long-term con-
sequencesrelevanttovisionandoverallqualityoflife.1-4
These injuries are associated with early and extended con-
cerns of ocular pain, decreased visual acuity, ectropion, and
extended risk for infection, although visual prognosis de-
pends on the extent of corneal, limbal, and conjunctival
involvement.1,2,4,5 Vision loss has been associated with in-
creased risk for serious injuries, depression, delirium, chronic
disease, and social health.6-13 These conditions and associ-
ated sequelae can also affect quality of life generally, as well
as reduce economic productivity.1-3,14-16
Chemical burns to the eye are usually caused by either
acidic or alkaline agents.17-19 Although both are serious inju-
ries, alkaline burns tend to have a more injurious profile ow-
ing to the ability of alkaline substances to cause cellular mem-
brane lysis, rapidly penetrate the cornea and anterior chamber,
and soften tissues.20-22 Conversely, acidic agents tend to pre-
cipitate proteins in the eye, which may collectively serve as a
barrier to further invasion of intraocular structures and limit
damage.2,5 Common agents of acidic ocular burns include sul-
furic, hydrochloric, hydrofluoric, and battery acids; in the case
of alkaline agents, common agents include cement or lime, so-
dium hydroxide (present in oven cleaners and drain clean-
ers), chlorine bleach (sodium hypochlorite), and ammonia
products.3,23
Despite the critical nature of chemical ocular injury, little
isknownregardingthenationalorinternationalincidence,and
existing information is dependent on case series, individual
or small multicenter medical record reviews, or setting-
specific reports, such as those from the US Bureau of Labor
Statistics.1,3,17,18,20-22,24-27 A 2013 publication from the Ameri-
can Association of Poison Control Centers reported approxi-
mately 98 000 calls associated with ocular exposures of con-
cern, although it is unclear how many exposures were due to
potentially injurious agents or the number of resulting
injuries.28 Case series generally report high numbers of ocu-
lar chemical burns caused by industrial or occupational expo-
sure, suggesting that men aged between 18 and 64 years may
beathighestriskforinjury.1,3,17,18,21Someseries,however,have
noted that such injuries among the young, including house-
holdinjuries,shouldnotbeignoredasapotentiallyseriousand
preventable form of injury.2,22,23
Despite the level of detail provided by the case series and
medical record reviews in the existing literature, estimates of
national incidence and population characteristics are vital to
the development of appropriate prevention and treatment
strategies at all levels of industry, health care, and govern-
ment. Using a nationally representative sample of US emer-
gency departments (EDs), we identified and characterized the
ED burden of chemical ocular burns from January 1, 2010,
through December 31, 2013.
Methods
The Nationwide Emergency Department Sample, part of the
Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, is the nation’
s largest
all-health care insurance ED database and contains discharge
data on approximately 30 million ED visits annually from more
than 900 hospitals nationwide.29 It is a 20% stratified sample
of national ED visits, designed to be weighted to the level of
theUSpopulationtoprovidenationalestimatesassociatedwith
ED care.
Cases were identified using International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)30
codes.OurcasedefinitionincludedanyvisitstoEDsfromJanu-
ary 1, 2010, through December 31, 2013, that comprised ICD-
9-CM diagnosis codes of alkaline burn of the cornea and con-
junctiva (code 940.2), acid burn of the cornea and conjunctiva
(code 940.3), chemical conjunctivitis (code 372.06), or a com-
bination of a nonspecific burn of the cornea and/or conjunc-
tiva (code 940.4) and either any poisoning by a topical medi-
cation (code 976.x) or any toxic effect by a chemical (code
989.x).30Anyrecordsthatweremissingdataonageorsexwere
excluded from analysis; to avoid double counting, we also ex-
cluded any visits that were coded as a follow-up (ICD-9-CM
code V67).
Using these case identification criteria, we queried the Na-
tionwideEmergencyDepartmentSamplefromJanuary1,2010
(the first year of the chemical conjunctivitis ICD-9-CM code),
through December 31, 2013, and examined the ED incidence
of ocular chemical burns by injury-level characteristics, such
as the setting of injury; patient-level factors, such as age, sex,
primary health care insurer, and income quartile were also ex-
amined, as were hospital region and total ED charges. Injury-
setting descriptions were combined into 4 categories: residen-
tial, including home and other residential facilities;
commercial, including industrial sites, mines, and farms; pub-
lic, including schools and other public buildings, streets and
highways, and sports and recreational facilities; and other lo-
cations, or were classified as missing. This study was de-
signed and conducted between August 1, 2015, and April 25,
2016, and the Johns Hopkins Medicine Institutional Review
Board approved this study and waived the need for informed
consent. The Nationwide Emergency Department Sample is a
limited data set from which all personally identifiable infor-
mationhasbeenremovedexceptdateslessthan1yearandgeo-
graphic locations smaller than a state.
The identification of an appropriate denominator for rate
calculation was difficult because we were unable to define or
Key Points
Question What populations are at highest risk for ocular chemical
burns?
Findings In a cross-sectional analysis of the US Nationwide
Emergency Department Sample, children aged 1 to 2 years are at a
significantly higher risk for ocular chemical burns than any other
group. In general, ocular chemical burn injuries are most common
among individuals aged between 18 and 64 years (73.2%).
Meaning Children aged 1 to 2 years are at much higher risk for an
ocular chemical burn than previously recognized, and effective
prevention efforts must include considerations for this age group.

nual household income quartiles were estimated by zip code
based on data collected by the Agency for Healthcare Re-
search and Quality from Nielsen Claritas, Inc, and were de-
fined as follows: first quartile (≤$39 249), second quartile
($39 250-$48 749),thirdquartile($48 750-$64 499),andfourth
quartile (≥$65 000).32
Standard descriptive statistical methods were used
(α = .05). Statistical analyses were conducted using the Stata
statistical software package (StataCorp LP).
Results
From January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2013, there were
144 149 ED visits associated with chemical ocular burns in the
United States. After excluding those cases missing age and sex
or that were coded as follow-up visits, 143 985 records re-
mained in our sample, corresponding to an average of 35 996
visits per year (Table 1). Men represented 56.6% of all cases
(n = 81 496).Medianagewas32years,withfemalepatientspre-
senting at a younger age than male patients (median of 32 vs
34 years; P < .001) . Injuries most commonly occurred in resi-
dential settings (n = 14 722 [10.3%; 95% CI, 9.6%-10.9%]), were
more common among individuals in the first and second in-
come quartiles (n = 80 691 [56.0%; 95% CI, 54.4%-57.7%]) and
those who had private health care insurance (n = 45 900
[31.9%;95%CI,30.9%-32.9%]),andoccurredmoreintheSouth
(n = 53 008 [36.8%; 95% CI, 34.6%-39.1%]). The settings of in-
jury varied substantially by age (Figure).
Age-specific incidence rates per 100 000 population were
highest among individuals aged 20 to 29 years (average, 17.4),
followed by age 30 to 39 years (14.9), 40 to 49 years (13.2), and
9 years or younger (12.1) (Figure). Among rates for individual
years of life, however, injuries were most common among
1-year-old (average, 28.6) and 2-year-old (23.5) children. The
rate for 1-year-old infants was 49.9% higher than that of the
highest rate among adults (28.6 vs 19.1 per 100 000 among 24-
year-old adults). Individuals aged between 6 and 14 years and
those older than 74 years had the lowest rates of injury. Men
and women aged between 18 and 64 years comprised 73.2%
(n = 105 334) of all chemical ocular burns, despite only com-
prising 62.8% (n = 785 887 831) of the population during the
study period.31,33

these totals underestimate the cost of these injuries, how-
ever, because 21 458 records (14.9%) were missing ED charge-
associated data.
Discussion
Chemical burns to the eye and adnexa are a serious problem
in the United States, comprising almost 36 000 ED visits and
$26.6 million in ED-associated charges every year. From Janu-
ary 1, 2010, through December 31, 2013, these injuries com-
prised more than 144 000 ED visits and more than $106 mil-
lion in ED charges. The economic effect of these injuries,
including lost workdays for the individuals who were burned
and their family members, loss of productivity, administra-
tive costs, and the cost of continued care for medical se-
quelae and lost visual acuity, comprises more than these data
reflect.
Although most literature emphasizes the increased risk for
ocular chemical burns among men aged between 18 and 64
years, we found that the age-specific risk for chemical ocular
injuries is highest among 1- and 2-year-old children.1,3,22 Fur-
thermore, among injuries classified as either alkaline or acidic,
children3yearsandyoungerhadmorealkalineburnsthanmen
aged between 18 and 64 years (78.0% [n = 534] vs 52.5%
[n = 7559]; P < .001, χ2 test). Alkaline agents, commonly found
in household cleaning chemicals, often cause more serious
burns than acidic injuries in the home; spray bottles contain-
ingtheseagentsrepresentanimportantsourceofinjuryamong
pediatric populations and may be a cause of the high rates of
chemical ocular burns we observed.19,23 It is important to note,
however, that 11.8% (n = 17 021) of chemical injuries were clas-
sified as alkaline or acidic; the remaining 88.2% (n = 126 964)
may represent burns by chemical agents of unknown acidity
or even burns from unknown chemicals.
As a group, individuals aged between 18 and 64 years are at
high risk for chemical eye injuries. This population comprises
more than 26 000 ED visits and more than $20.5 million in ED
charges every year. Like their pediatric counterparts, although
toalesserextent,individualsagedbetween18and64yearswere
morepronetohaveanalkalineocularburnthananacidicburn.
Although injuries in this age group occurred in settings catego-
rizedasotherthanresidential,commercial,orpublicproperties,
incidenceinresidentiallocations(8.7%,n = 9181)wassimilarto
that of commercial settings (8.2%, n = 8612). This equivalency

ingeducationforpoliceofficers,parents,paramedics,andhealth
care professionals regarding appropriate and timely treatment
of these chemical burns (ie, copious and immediate irrigation
with clean water), may be effective in alleviating the long-term
effects of injuries.37
Preventing workplace injuries should be a priority of cor-
porateleadershipandgovernmentregulators.Guidelinesman-
dating employer-purchased worker safety equipment, such as
those issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Adminis-
tration in 2007, are important for reducing the burden of these
injuries among individuals aged between 18 and 64 years.38
As with any study conducted using administrative data,
this effort had limitations.39 Although we were able to iden-
tify blindness and reduced visual acuity as a diagnosis on dis-
charge, we were unable to diagnose injuries caused by un-
known agents or substances, which limited our ability to
examinevisualoutcomes.Inaddition,becauseourdatasetwas
limited to ED visits, we were unable to measure the incidence
of patients presenting to either outpatient (eg, ophthalmolo-
gists, optometrists, or primary care physicians) or urgent care
centers for treatment.
Conclusions
Ocular chemical burns are a large problem in the United States,
and the risk to young children is substantially higher than pre-
vious estimates showed. Individuals aged between 18 and 64
years are most commonly affected by these injuries. Public
health efforts and policies should concentrate on the appro-
priate storage and handling of chemicals in the home and in
the workplace. Continued efforts by the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration to strengthen and enforce regula-
tions associated with protective eyewear in the workplace will
also be important to preventing these injuries. Although fur-
ther research is necessary to examine the effectiveness of in-
terventionefforts,suchpoliciesshoulduseage-appropriateand
setting-appropriate strategies.
