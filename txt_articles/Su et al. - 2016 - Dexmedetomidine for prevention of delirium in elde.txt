Summary
Background Delirium is a postoperative complication that occurs frequently in patients older than 65 years, and 
presages adverse outcomes. We investigated whether prophylactic low-dose dexmedetomidine, a highly selective 
α2 adrenoceptor agonist, could safely decrease the incidence of delirium in elderly patients after non-cardiac surgery.
Methods We did this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in two tertiary-care hospitals in Beijing, 
China. We enrolled patients aged 65 years or older, who were admitted to intensive care units after non-cardiac 
surgery, with informed consent. We used a computer-generated randomisation sequence (in a 1:1 ratio) to randomly 
assign patients to receive either intravenous dexmedetomidine (0·1 μg/kg per h, from intensive care unit admission 
on the day of surgery until 0800 h on postoperative day 1), or placebo (intravenous normal saline). Participants, care 
providers, and investigators were all masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was the incidence of 
delirium, assessed twice daily with the Confusion Assessment Method for intensive care units during the fi
 rst 
7 postoperative days. Analyses were done by intention-to-treat and safety populations. This study is registered with 
Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, www.chictr.org.cn, number ChiCTR-TRC-10000802.
Findings Between Aug 17, 2011, and Nov 20, 2013, of 2016 patients assessed, 700 were randomly assigned to receive 
either placebo (n=350) or dexmedetomidine (n=350). The incidence of postoperative delirium was signifi
 cantly lower 
in the dexmedetomidine group (32 [9%] of 350 patients) than in the placebo group (79 [23%] of 350 patients; odds 
ratio [OR] 0·35, 95% CI 0·22–0·54; p<0·0001). Regarding safety, the incidence of hypertension was higher with 
placebo (62 [18%] of 350 patients) than with dexmedetomidine (34 [10%] of 350 patients; 0·50, 0·32–0·78; p=0·002). 
Tachycardia was also higher in patients given placebo (48 [14%] of 350 patients) than in patients given dexmedetomidine 
(23 [7%] of 350 patients; 0·44, 0·26–0·75; p=0·002). Occurrence of hypotension and bradycardia did not diff
 er 
between groups.
Interpretation For patients aged over 65 years who are admitted to the intensive care unit after non-cardiac surgery, 
prophylactic low-dose dexmedetomidine signifi
 cantly decreases the occurrence of delirium during the fi
 rst 7 days 
after surgery. The therapy is safe.

Introduction
 
A systematic review1 revealed that postoperative delirium 
occurs in 11–51% of patients after surgery, and its 
prevalence increases with age. 
 
 The occurrence of 
delirium is associated with increased morbidity and 
mortality, prolonged hospital stay, worse functional 
recovery, and long-term decline in cognitive function.1,2  
In patients admitted to hospital, around 30–40% of 
delirium cases are thought to be attributable to modifi
 able 
risk factors, and are therefore preventable.3  Various 
approaches aimed at minimising the infl
 uence of risk 
factors in medical patients have not improved outcomes, 
and there are no conclusive studies that support 
pharmacological prophylaxis.4
Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective  
 
α2 adrenoreceptor 
agonist that provides  
 
anxiolysis, sedation, and modest 
analgesia 
with 
minimal 
respiratory 
depression.5 
Dexmedetomidine is increasingly used for sedation in 
mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit 
(ICU),6 where its use is associated with a decreased 
prevalence of delirium when compared with other 
sedatives.7,8 However, in each of these delirium-sparing 
studies,7–9 dexmedetomidine was compared with an active 
sedative drug that modulates the γ-aminobutyric-acid 
type A (GABA 
 
A) receptors. These modulators of GABAA 
receptors, exemplifi
 ed by benzodiazepines, could increase 
the 
prevalence 
of 
delirium.10 
Another 
plausible 
explanation is that dexmedetomidine does not prevent 
the occurrence of delirium, but also does not increase the 
prevalence of delirium as do modulators of the GABAA 
receptors. Furthermore 
 
, the targeted patients were 
mechanically ventilated, which itself increases the risk 
of delirium.11 Therefore, it is not clear whether 
dexmedetomidin 
 
e has preventive eff
 ects against delirium 
in 
 
 other patient populations, including non-ventilated 
patients. Lastly, the sedative dose of dexmedetomidine

used in the earlier studies9 was associated with an 
increase in hypotension or bradycardia, whic 
h limits  
a 
wider clinical application.6 Because dexmedetomidine 
induces haemodynamic changes in a dose-dependent 
pattern,12 it is important to defi
 ne whether a lower dose 
than that used in other studies is still benefi
 cial in 
decreasing delirium with fewer haemodynamic changes. 
 
Sleep disturbances are common in postoperative 
patients, especially in those who are admitted to the ICU 
after major surgery,13 and poor sleep is associated with a 
higher prevalence of postoperative delirium.14 Results of a 
2014 study15 showed that night-time infusion of sedative 
dose dexmedetomidine improved sleep quality in 
mechanically ventilated ICU patients. With these results 
in mind, we did a feasibility study to test our hypothesis 
that low-dose dexmedetomidine infusion at a rate of 
0·1 μg/kg per h could be benefi
 cial for patients’ sleep and 
beyond. We found that prophylactic infusion of low-dose 
dexmedetomidine improved the overall sleep quality 
measured 
by 
polysomnography 
and 
subjective 
assessment. This fi
 nding encouraged us to do a 
randomised controlled trial with a large sample size 
 
 
 
 to 
investigate whether prophylactic intravenous infusion of 
low-dose dexmedetomidine decreases delirium in patients 
aged over 65 years (hereafter referred to as elderly patients) 
admitted to the ICU after non-cardiac surgery.
Methods
Study design 
 
We did a randomised, double-blind, parallel-arm placebo-
controlled trial in the ICUs of Peking University First 
Hospital and Peking University Third Hospital in Beijing, 
China. The study was designed to assess the superiority of 
the intervention. The study protocol (appendix) was 
approved by the local Clinical Research Ethics Committees 
(2011[10]). We obtained written informed consent from 
patients whose competence was established by their 
accurate orientation for time, place, and person, and 
understanding of the recruiter’s description of the trial, or 
otherwise from their next of kin or their legal representative 
(appendix).
Patients 
We screened potential participants on admission to the 
ICU. The inclusion criteria were patients aged 65 years or 
older who underwent elective non-cardiac surgery under 
general anaesthesia and were admitted to the ICU after 
surgery before 2000 h. Patients were excluded if they met 
any of the following criteria: preoperative history of 
schizophrenia, epilepsy, Parkinsonism, or myasthenia 
gravis; inability to communicate in the preoperative period 
(coma, profound dementia, or language barrier); brain 
injury or neurosurgery; known preoperative left ventricular 
ejection fraction less than 30%, sick sinus syndrome, severe 
sinus bradycardia (<50 beats per min [bpm]), or second-
degree or greater atrioventricular block without pacemaker; 
serious hepatic dysfunction  
 
(Child-Pugh class C); serious 
renal dysfunction (undergoing dialysis before surgery); or 
low likelihood of survival for more than 24 h.
Randomisation and masking 
 
A biostatistician, who was independent of data 
management and statistical analyses 
, generated random 
numbers (in a 1:1 ratio) using the SAS 9.2 software (SAS 
Institute, Cary, NC) 
. The results of randomisation were 
sealed in sequentially numbered envelopes and stored at 
the site of investigation until the end of the study. 
During the study period, 
 
 consecutively recruited ICU 
patients were randomly assigned to receive either 
 
 
dexmedetomidine or placebo (normal saline). A study 
nurse administered the study drugs according to the 
randomisation sequence.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed between Jan 1, 2001, and Dec 31, 2015, 
with the terms of “dexmedetomidine”, “postoperative 
delirium”, and “elderly”, and then limited to either “randomized 
controlled trial” or “meta-analysis”. We identifi
 ed seven small 
sample size randomised trials (three published in English and 
four in Chinese) and one meta-analysis. Dexmedetomidine was 
administered in fi
 ve trials in a relatively high dose for sedation 
in postoperative patients. Of those, the primary endpoint was 
not the incidence or prevalence of delirium in three trials; in two 
trials published in Chinese, dexmedetomidine decreased the 
incidence of delirium during the fi
 rst 3 days after oral cancer 
surgery in one trial while, in the other, patient-controlled 
analgesia supplemented with dexmedetomidine, given to 
elderly patients after spinal surgery, did not reduce the 
incidence of delirium during the fi
 rst 3 postoperative days. 
The meta-analysis publication suggested that 
dexmedetomidine use in perioperative conditions or for 
intesive care unit (ICU) sedation is associated with a low risk of 
neurocognitive dysfunction. 
Added value of this study
 
To our knowledge, this study is the fi
 rst to suggest that 
prophylactic infusion of low-dose dexmedetomidine, an 
α2 adrenoceptor agonist sedative, signifi
 cantly decreases the 
prevalence of postoperative delirium without increase in 
adverse events.
Implications of all available evidence
The sub-sedative dose of dexmedetomidine can be safely used 
for elderly ICU patients after surgery, both with and without 
endotracheal intubation, to reduce the likelihood of 
postoperative delirium.

team members, and patients were masked to the 
treatment group assignment throughout the study 
period 
 
 
 
. In an emergency (eg, unexpected, rapid 
deterioration in the patient’s clinical status), intensivists 
could request unmasking of the treatment allocation, or 
adjust or interrupt study drug infusion if 
 
 necessary. No 
unmasking occurred. These situations were documented, 
although analyses were done on the intention-to-treat 
population. 
 
Procedures
Study drugs  
 
(dexmedetomidine hydrochloride 200 μg/2 mL 
and normal saline 2 mL) were provided as clear aqueous 
solutions in the same 3 mL bottles (manufactured by 
Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co, Ltd, Jiangsu, China) and 
dispensed according to the randomisation results by a 
pharmacist who did not participate in the rest of the study. 
The study drugs were diluted with normal saline to 50 mL 
(ie, dexmedetomidine hydrochloride fi
 nal concentration 
was 4 μg/mL) before administration.
For patients who were not intubated, study drugs were 
given 
 
 as a continuous intravenous infusion at a rate of 
0·025 mL/kg per h (0·1 μg/kg per h of dexmedetomidine 
in the treatment group 
 
) from study recruitmen 
 
t on the 
day of surgery (usually within 1 h after ICU admission) 
until 
 
 0800 h on the fi
 rst day after surgery. For 
 
 those who 
were intubated and mechanically ventilated, the study 
drug infusion was started only afte 
 
 
 
r sedative (propofol or 
midazolam) administration was titrated to 
 
 a Richmond 
Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS)16 of –2 or higher 
 
(assessed hourly).
Postoperative analgesia was given with patient-controlled 
intravenous or epidural analgesia. For patients who 
did not receive patient-controlled analgesia or those who 
required analgesia in addition to that provided 
from patient-controlled dispensers 
 
 
 
, morphine or non-
steroid anti-infl
 ammatory drugs (fl
 urbiprofen axetil) were 
given via intravenous infusion or bolus injection 
 
 
 
 
 
. 
Mechanically ventilated patients were sedated with 
propofol or midazolam via intravenous infusion or bolus 
injection, and morphine as necessary, titrated to achieve 
an RASS between –2 and +1 (assessed every 4 h). Daily 
sedation interruption was done for those who were not 
extubated by the morning of postoperative day 1. Patients 
were extubated when they met the following three criteria: 
adequate gas exchange during a spontaneous breathing 
trial, stable haemodynamic status (20% over or under 
baseline), and a level of consciousness associated with 
refl
 exes that protect the airway.
Severa 
 
l approaches to reduce the occurrence of delirium 
were instituted as part of standard operating procedures 
for patients in the ICU, including repeated reorientation, 
cognitive stimulation, early mobilisation, sleep-promotion 
strategies, hearing or vision aids, and timely correction of 
dehydration.17 Patients who developed postoperative 
delirium were fi
 rst given non-pharmacological strategies.18 
Haloperidol treatment was administered to those with 
severe agitation (RASS score of +3 or more 
 
) that was 
unresponsive to non-pharmacological therapy 
 
.19 Enrolled 
patients were not to be given open-label dexmedetomidine; 
scopolamine and penehyclidine were prohibited; atropine 
was used only for the purpose of reversing bradycardia. 
ICU discharge was decided by the responsible intensivists; 
hospital discharge was decided by the responsible 
surgeons. Time of actual discharge was recorded. 
 
Outcomes 
 
Outcome assessment was done by research members 
who were trained before the study and not involved in the 
clinical care of patients. The primary endpoint was the 
incidence of delirium in the fi
 rst 7 days after surgery. The 
fi
 rst assessment of postoperative (also referred to as 
interval) delirium was done around 24 h after surgery;20 we 
selected the timing of the fi
 rst assessment to avoid 
diagnosing 
emergence 
delirium 
that 
can 
occur 
immediately after general anaesthesia and is not 
associated with adverse outcomes.21,22 Twice daily (in the 
morning from 0800 h to 1000 h and in the evening from 
1800 h to 2000 h) until the seventh day after surgery, we 
assessed delirium by the Confusion Assessment Method 
for the ICU (CAM-ICU); (appendix),23 which has been 
validated in Chinese patients in the ICU setting24 and the 
feasibility of which had been established in our other 
studies.25,26 CAM-ICU addresses the four features of 
delirium, namely, acute onset of mental status changes or 
a fl
 uctuating course, inattention, disorganised thinking, 
and altered level of consciousness. To achieve the 
diagnosis of delirium, a patient had to display acute onset 
of mental status changes or fl
 uctuating course and 
inattention, with either disorganised thinking or altered 
level of consciousness. Immediately before assessing 
delirium, sedation or agitation was assessed using RASS. 
If the patient was too deeply sedated or unarousable 
(RASS –4 or –5), delirium assessment was aborted and the 
patient was recorded as comatose. If RASS was greater 
than –4 (–3 to +4), delirium was assessed by use of the 
CAM-ICU. Patients with delirium were classifi
 ed into 
three 
 
 motoric subtypes. Hyperactive delirium was defi
 ned 
when RASS was consistently positive (+1 to +4); hypoactive 
delirium was defi
 ned when RASS was consistently neutral 
or negative (–3 to 0); and mixed delirium was defi
 ned 
when some RASS scores were positive (+1 to +4) and some 
RASS scores were neutral or negative (–3 to 0).27 For 
patients who were discharged or died within 7 days after 
surgery, the results of the last delirium assessment were 
considered the results of the missing data. These patients 
were excluded when calculating daily prevalence of 
delirium in a post-hoc analysis.
Secondary endpoints included time to extubation (from 
ICU admission to extubation), length of stay in the ICU 
(from ICU admission to ICU discharge), length of stay in 
the hospital after surgery (from day of surgery to hospital 
discharge), occurrence of non-delirium postoperative 
complications, and all-cause 30-day mortality. Non-delirium

complications were generally defi
 ned as medical events 
other than delirium that required therapeutic intervention 
and occurred within 30 days after surgery (appendix). 
Additional prespecifi
 ed endpoints included postoperative 
pain intensity and subjective sleep quality. Pain intensity 
both at rest and with movement was assessed by use of the 
 
 
Numeric Rating Scale (NRS, an 11 point scale where 0 
indicated no pain and 10 indicated the worst possible pain) 
at 3 h, 6 h, and 24 h after surgery. Subjective sleep quality 
was assessed by use of the 
 
 NRS as well (an 11 point scale 
where 0 indicated the best possible sleep and 10 indicated 
the worst possible sleep)28 at 0800 h on the fi
 rst, second, 
and third days after surgery. Assessments of pain and 
sleep were only done if the RASS score was more than –4 
(–3 to +4).
Adverse events were monitored until 24 h after surgery 
or until resolution of the event. Bradycardia was defi
 ned 
as heart rate less than 55 bpm or a decrease of more than 
20% from baseline (in case of a baseline value [before 
study drug infusion] less than 69 bpm). Hypotension was 
defi
 ned as systolic blood pressure less than 95 mm Hg or 
a decrease of more than 20% from baseline (in case of a 
baseline value less than 119 mm Hg) 
 
. Tachycardia was 
defi
 ned as heart rate greater than 100 bpm or an increase 
of more than 20% from baseline (in case of a baseline 
value greater than 83 bpm). Hypertension was defi
 ned as 
systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mm Hg or an 
increase of more than 20% from baseline (in case of a 
baseline value greater than 133 mm Hg). Hypoxaemia 
was defi
 ned as pulse oxygen saturation less than 90% or 
a decrease of more than 5% (absolute value) from 
baseline. Intervention for bradycardia, tachycardia, and 
hypertension included adjustment of study drug infusion 
or administration of medication, or both. Intervention for 
hypotension included adjustment of study drug infusion, 
intravenous fl
 uid bolus, or administration of medication. 
Intervention for hypoxaemia included administration of 
oxygen (for patients without endotracheal intubation), 
adjustment of ventilator setting (for patients with 
endotracheal intubation), or physiotherapy.
Patients were followed up weekly after the fi
 rst week 
until 30 days after surgery. 
 
 All-cause 30-day mortality was 
recorded (appendix).
Statistical analysis
In our study, the incidence of postoperative delirium in a 
comparable 
 
 patient population was 28%. In previous 
studies,8,9 the incidence of delirium was reduced by 
roughly a third when dexmedetomidine was used in the 
ICU for sedating mechanically ventilated patients. Thus, 
we assumed that the incidence of delirium would be 
reduced by a third in the dexmedetomidine group in this 
study. With signifi
 cance set at 0·05 and power set at 80%, 
the sample size required to detect diff
 erences was 
656 patients, calculated with the Stata 10.0 software 
(StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). Taking into 
account a loss-to-follow-up rat 
 
e of about 6%, we planned 
to enrol 700 patients.
Numeric variables were analysed by use of an unpaired 
t test or Mann-Whitney u test. Categorical variables were 
analysed with the χ² test, continuity correction χ² test or 
likelihood ratio χ² test. The diff
 erence (and 95% CI for 
the diff
 erence) between two medians was calculated with 
the Hodges-Lehmann estimator. Time to event results 
were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier estimator, with 
diff
 erences between groups assessed by the log-rank test. 
Number needed to treat was estimated for the primary 
endpoint during a 7-day follow-up period. Because 
management of patients with or without endotracheal 
intubation on ICU admission is diff
 erent, post-hoc 
subgroup analyses were also done.
We analysed outcome data and safety in the 
intention-to-treat population. We also did per-protocol 
analysis for the primary endpoint. We did not do an interim 
analysis. Statistical analyses were done on SPSS 14.0 software 
(SPSS, Chicago, IL) and SAS 9.2 software (SAS Institute, 
Cary, NC) with two-tailed tests wherever appropriate and 
p values less than 0·05 were considere 
 
d to be of statistical 
signifi
 cance

Peking University First Hospital was involved in overseeing 
the data. The study is registered with www.chictr.org.cn,

Results
Between Aug 17, 2011, and Nov 20, 2013, 2016 patients 
were screened for study participation; of these, 
700 patients were enrolled into the study and randomly 
assigned to receive either dexmedetomidine (n=350) or 
placebo (n=350); (fi
 gure 1). During the study period, 
there were no lapses in the blinding. Study drug infusion 
was modifi
 ed in 48 patients because of adverse events. 
Delirium assessment was completed in all patients on 
the fi
 rst day of ICU admission. No assessment was 
aborted because of deep sedation. 143 patients were 
discharged from the hospital within 7 days after surgery. 
Two patients died, both on postoperative day 2 (one 
patient in each group). All patients were included in the 
fi
 nal intention-to-treat analyses (fi
 gure 1). The fi
 nal visit 
of the last randomised patient was done on Dec 20, 2013.
Overall, the two groups were well matched for baseline 
and perioperative variables, except that the percentage of 
patients with preoperative renal dysfunction (serum 
creatinine greater than 177 μmol/L) was lower in the 
dexmedetomidine group than in the placebo group and 
the percentage of patients who required intraoperative 
blood transfusion was less in the dexmedetomidine 
group than in the placebo group (table 1 and appendix). 
After randomisation, a similar proportion of patients 
received supplemental sedation in both groups. However, 
among patients who received propofol sedation (for 
mechanical ventilation) after surgery, the total dose of 
propofol given was less in the dexmedetomidine group 
than in the placebo group (table 1). 
 
Postoperative delirium occurred in 79 (23%) of 
350 patients given placebo, and in 32 (9%) of 350 patients 
given dexmedetomidine (odds ratio [OR] 0·35, 95% CI 
0·22–0·54; p<0·0001), with number needed to treat of 
7·4 (95% CI 5·3–12·3) during 7-day follow-up. Per-
protocol analysis also showed a similar diff
 erence in the 
prevalence of delirium between groups (74 [22%] of 
334 patients given placebo vs 29 [9%] of 318 patients 
given dexmedetomidine, OR 0·35; 95% CI 0·22–0·56, 
p<0·0001). 
Post-hoc 
analyses 
showed 
that 
daily 
prevalence of delirium was signifi
 cantly lower in the 
dexmedetomidine group than in the placebo group on 
postoperative days 1–3 (day 1: 0·28, 0·16–0·50; p<0·0001, 
day 2: 0·43, 0·24–0·77; p=0·005, day 3: 0·26, 0·13–0·53; 
p<0·0001, fi
 gure 2). The reduction in the incidence of 
delirium remained when patients were stratifi
 ed 
according to the intubation status on ICU admission 
(table 2). Each of the three motoric subtypes of delirium 
was signifi
 cantly decreased in the dexmedetomidine 
group (p<0·0001). The delirium-sparing eff
 ect of low-dose 
dexmedetomidine became signifi
 cant when the duration 
of infusion was 12·25 h or longer (table 2).
For patients with endotracheal intubation on ICU 
admission, median time to extubation was longer in the 
placebo group than in the dexmedetomidine group 
(6·9 h [95% CI 5·2–8·6] with placebo and 4·6 h [3·4–5·8] 
with dexmedetomidine [hazard ratio (HR) 1·25, 95% CI 
1·02–1·53; p=0·031]). For all patients, the aggregate 
prevalence of non-delirium complications was reduced 
from 73 (21%) of 350 patients given placebo to 52 (15%)

of 350 patients given dexmedetomidine (OR 0·66, 
95% CI 0·45–0·98; p=0·039) (appendix), the length of 
stay in the ICU was longer in the placebo group, at 21·5 h 
(20·7–22·3) than with dexmedetomidine (20·9 h 
[20·4–21·4]; HR 1·18, 1·02–1·37; p=0·027); no signifi
 cant 
diff
 erences between the two groups were seen in length 
of stay in hospital after surgery and all-cause 30-day 
mortality. However, in a post-hoc analysis, the percentage 
of patients who were discharged from hospital within 
7 days after surgery was highe 
 
r in the dexmedetomidine 
group (83 [24%] of 350 patients) than in the placebo 
group (60 [17%] of 350 patients, OR 1·50; 1·04–2·18, 
p=0·032; table 2).
The NRS pain scores both at rest and with movement 
were signifi
 cantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group 
than in the placebo group at 3, 6, and 24 h after surgery 
(all p<0·0001, except for one p=0·001 at 24 h with 
movement); however, the mean diff
 erence of NRS pain 
score between groups was small (0 to –1). The NRS 
scores of subjective sleep quality were also signifi
 cantly 
lower (ie, better) in the dexmedetomidine group than in 
the placebo group at 0800 h on the fi
 rst, second, and third 
days after surgery (all p<0·0001; table 2).
The RASS scores at the end of study drug infusion 
were similar between the two groups. Incidence of 
bradycardia and hypotension did not diff
 er between 
groups, or the percentage of patients requiring 
intervention for these adverse events. On the other hand, 
the incidence of tachycardia (p=0·002), hypertension 
(p=0·002), and hypoxaemia (p=0·001) were signifi
 cantly 
lower, and, accordingly, the percentages of patients who 
required intervention for tachycardia (p=0·005) and 
hypertension (p=0·016) were signifi
 cantly less in the 
dexmedetomidine group than in the placebo group. 
However, the percentages of patients in whom the study 
drug infusion was modifi
 ed (infusion rate decreased, or 
infusion interrupted temporarily or permanently) were 
signifi
 cantly greater (p=0·046) in the dexmedetomidine 
group than in the placebo group (table 3).
Discussion 
 
Our results suggest that a prophylactic low-dose 
dexmedetomidine infusion signifi
 cantly decreases the 
incidence of delirium in the fi
 rst 7 days after surgery in 
elderly patients admitted to the ICU after non-cardiac 
surgery. This conclusion seems to be true for patients with 
or without endotracheal intubation on ICU admission and 
for all three motoric subtypes of delirium. Dexmedetomidine 
also signifi
 cantly improves the subjective quality of sleep, 
decreases the prevalence of non-delirium complications, 
shortens the length of stay in the ICU, and increases the 
percentage of early hospital discharge, but does not 
signifi
 cantly increase adverse events. To our knowledge, 
ours is the fi
 rst suffi
  ciently powered randomised study that 
shows the benefi
 t of low-dose dexmedetomidine infusion 
in this surgical patient population.
Postoperative delirium developed in 23% of patients in 
the placebo group 
 
, similar to previous studies 
 
.1,11,25 In 
keeping with previous reports, the prevalence of 
postoperative delirium was highe 
 
r in the patients with 
endotracheal intubation on ICU admission than in those 
without.29 This diff
 erence might be due to a more severe 
underlying condition in intubated patients on ICU 
admission, which is associated with an increased risk of 
postoperative delirium.30 Secondly, our protocol permitted 
the use of supplemental sedatives or analgesics in 
mechanically ventilated patients during ICU stay; 
consequently more of these patients received supplemental 
propofol, midazolam, and morphine, each of which might 
increase the risk of postoperative delirium.31
Dexmedetomidine has been used by intensivists in 
general practice for sedation in mechanically ventilated 
ICU patients 
 
 at an infusion rate from 0·2 to 1·7 μg/kg per h 
with or without a loading dose 
 
;7–9 these sedative doses of 
dexmedetomidine are associated with 
 
 adverse events, 
especially hypotension and bradycardia.7–9 In this study, 
patients 
were 
not 
given 
a 
loading 
dose 
of 
dexmedetomidine, and a sub-sedative 
 
 infusion rate (ie, 
0·1 μg/kg per h) was given. The RASS scores were similar 
between the two groups 
 
, indicating that low-dose 
dexmedetomidine did not produc 
 
e signifi
 cant sedation. 
Our protocol was designed to ensure a period of study 
drug infusion from ICU admission on the day of surgery 
until 0800 h on the fi
 rst postoperative morning for a 
number of reasons. Firstly, any prophylactic pharma-
cological intervention should be initiated early because 
the prevalence of delirium is at its highest during the 
early postoperative hours.30 Secondly, study drug infusion 
should cover the night-time hours, to improve patients’ 
sleep quality, since dexmedetomidine’s central action 
converges on the endogenous sleep-promoting pathway.32 
Thirdly, we anticipated that about half of the elective

surgical population that require ICU admission would be 
discharged from the ICU within 24 h; by terminating 
infusion of dexmedetomidine at 0800 h on the fi
 rst 
postoperative day, enough time has elapsed to enable a 
drug with a terminal elimination half-life of 3·7 h to be 
cleared from the plasma by the time the patient is 
discharged from the ICU.33
Although results of previous studies7–9,31 showed that the 
occurrence of delirium was reduced in patients randomly

sedative-inducing 
doses 
of 
dexmedetomidine versus an alternative sedative-hypnotic

those patients benefi
 te 
 
d through a prophylactic action of 
dexmedetomidine, or by avoiding delirium-inducing 
sedatives 
and 
analgesics.

the total consumed propofol dose was less in the patients 
who received dexmedetomidine (table 1). Additionally, 
post-hoc subgroup analysis showed that dexmedetomidine 
was effi
  cacious in preventing postoperative delirium in 
both the intubated and non-intubated patients. Although 
the absolute eff
 ect size for the delirium-reducing 
improvement was higher in the intubated patients, the 
improvement was quite similar (table 2). Importantly, our 
data also showed that the delirium-sparing eff
 ect of 
low-dose dexmedetomidine is dose-dependent, because 
there is a signifi
 cant negative correlation between the 
amount of dexmedetomidine given (infusion duration 
multiplied by rate) and the probability of developing 
delirium 
(Pearson 
correlation 
coeffi
  cient 
–0·190, 
p<0·0001). Moreover, dexmedetomidine’s eff
 ect in 
preventing delirium was not limited to the period of drug 
infusion but extended up to the third postoperative day 
(fi
 gure 2). Collectively, taking this investigation together 
with previous studies, one can state with greater 
confi
 dence that the inclusion of dexmedetomidine was 
the reason for the delirium-reducing eff
 ect.
Dexmedetomidine signifi
 cantly decreased hypoxaemia 
in our patients; results of other studies14,34 have showed 
that postoperative hypoxaemia independently contributes 
to the development of delirium. The underlying 
mechanism for dexmedetomidine’s hypoxaemia-sparing 
action was not directly investigated; preclinical studies 
highlight its pulmonary protective eff
 ect after remote 
organ injury.35 However, this apparent eff
 ect could also 
just be a coincident signifi
 cant fi
 nding and warrants 
further study.
Dexmedetomidine can provide analgesia by acting on 
the α2 adrenergic receptors in the spinal cord.36,37 Our 
results also showed that a lower dose of dexmedetomidine 
signifi
 cantly decreased postoperative NRS pain score for 
up to 24 h after surger 
 
y. However, this decrease is small 
and, therefore, unlikely to have clinical signifi
 cance. 
Nevertheless, pain itself is a risk factor for the development 
of delirium,38 so a delirium-spari 
 
ng pharmacoprophylaxis 
would seem to be a better strategy than increasing putative 
delirium-enhancing 
analgesic 
drugs 
to 
combat 
postoperative pain.
Results of this study show that dexmedetomidine 
infusion signifi
 cantly improves the subjective sleep 
quality of postoperative ICU patients, and this benefi
 t 
persists beyond the period of drug infusion, ie, for 
3 
postoperative 
days, 
which 
is 
consistent 
with 
signifi
 cant reduction in daily delirium prevalence. 
Dexmedetomidine exerts hypnotic properties by activati 
 
ng 
t 
 
he endogenous sleep-promoting pathway and produces a 
stage II non-rapid eye movement sleep-like state.32 In 
mechanically ventilated ICU patients, night-time infusion 
of dexmedetomidine (0·2–0·7 μg/kg per h) preserved 
day–night sleep cycles.39 We speculated that producing a 
state akin to natural sleep with dexmedetomidine would 
be a better strategy than delirium-enhancing sedative-
hypnotics, such as benzodiazepines, that produce an 
immobilised state that is unlike natural sleep.40
Apart from the dexmedetomidine-induced improvements 
in hypoxaemia, analgesia, and sleep in this study, a possible 
mechanism for dexmedetomidine’s postoperative delirium-
reducing property might also be attributed to its actions on 
infl
 ammation that are evident both clinically41 and in 
preclinical models.42 A strong association has been shown 
between elevated biomarkers of infl
 ammation and the risk 
for developing delirium;43 the causal nature of this 
relationship has been repeatedly shown in preclinical 
studies.44,45 As biomarkers of infl
 ammation were not 
measured it is not possible to assess whether low-dose 
dexmedetomidine infusion suppresses the infl
 ammation 
associated with the aseptic trauma of surgery.
In 
respect 
of 
safety, 
our 
data 
reveal 
that 
dexmedetomidine-induced bradycardia and hypotension 
were not signifi
 cantly increased, possibly because of the 
very low doses that were used, whereas hypertension and 
tachycardia were both signifi
 cantly decreased in patients 
given dexmedetomidine. However, our study was 
powered for effi
  cacy, but not safety; a larger-scale study 
will be required to rule out possible safety concerns. 
Nevertheless, the haemodynamic-stabilising property of 
dexmedetomidine might be benefi
 cial, as this property 
reduces adverse cardiac events in high-risk patients.46 
Although we did not observe signifi
 cant diff
 erences in 
cardiovascular events in the present study, the overall 
prevalence 
of 
postoperative 
complications 
was 
signifi
 cantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group.

s. First, the ICU is a noisy and task-intensive 
environment that places patients at risk for delirium 
through sleep deprivation and sleep fragmentation. As we 
only enrolled ICU surgical patients, it is not certain that 
low-dose dexmedetomidine infusion will lessen sleep 
disruptions and thereby decrease delirium in postoperative 
patients in non-ICU settings or medical patients in the 
ICU. Second, all participants were screened and enrolled 
after ICU admission and did not have baseline delirium 
assessment 
with 
cognitive 
function 
assessment. 
Therefore, we cannot preclude the potential bias 
introduced by preoperative imbalance of baseline 
conditi 
 
ons. However, strict randomisation and large 
sample size should have helped to balance these factors 
between group 
 
s. Third, despite stri 
 
ct randomisation, 
some baseline and perioperative parameters were not well 
balanced between the two groups, a not uncommon 
feature in randomised controlled trials. Therefore, we 
cannot preclude the potential bias produced by imbalance 
of these factors. Lastly, it has been noted that CAM-ICU 
might not be as sensitive as other tools, eg, 3D-CAM, for 
delirium assessment especially for other ethnic groups50,51 
and in non-ICU settings.52
Our study indicates that, in elderly patients admitted to 
the ICU after non-cardiac surgery, prophylactic low-dose 
dexmedetomidine infusion signifi
 cantly decreases the 
prevalence of postoperative delirium. The administration 
of low-dose dexmedetomidine did not signifi
 cantly 
increase the prevalence of bradycardia or hypotension, 
but 
signifi
 cantly 
decreased 
the 
prevalence 
of 
hypertension, tachycardia, and hypoxaemia. Howeve 
 
r, 
whether the favourable eff
 ects aff
 orded by this novel 
application of dexmedetomidine result in improved long-
term outcomes remains unknown.
