Introduction
The course of Alzheimer’s disease is characterised by 
progressive accumulation of neuropathology over 
decades. The initial asymptomatic phase continues into a 
prodromal phase with mild, but noticeable, cognitive and 
functional impairment,1 and eventually progression to 
dementia. This gradual progression creates a window of 
opportunity for interventions in early disease stages.2 
Specific criteria to define the prodromal phase of 
Alzheimer’s 
disease 
have 
been 
proposed 
using 
biomarkers and clinical criteria,3–5 but no pharmacological 
treatment is currently available for individuals with 
prodromal Alzheimer’s disease. Development of safe 
and effective interventions in early Alzheimer’s disease 
stages remains imperative. Prevention trials from the 
past 2 years have shown promising results with 
multimodal, non-pharmacological approaches, including 
dietary interventions.6,7
Diet is an important modifiable risk factor for dementia,8 
and a nutrient intervention in mild cognitive impairment 
showed effects on brain atrophy.9 LipiDiDiet is a research 
consortium, which studies the preclinical and clinical 
impact of nutrition in Alzheimer’s disease. This research 
resulted in experimental dietary interventions, which 
contributed to the development of the medical food 
Souvenaid (Nutricia; Zoetermeer, the Netherlands). The 
active component of Souvenaid is the multinutrient 
combination 
(Fortasyn 
Connect), 
which 
contains 
24-month intervention with a specific multinutrient in 
people with prodromal Alzheimer’s disease (LipiDiDiet): 
a randomised, double-blind, controlled trial

Summary
Background Nutrition is an important modifiable risk factor in Alzheimer’s disease. Previous trials of the multinutrient 
Fortasyn Connect showed benefits in mild Alzheimer’s disease dementia. LipiDiDiet investigated the effects of 
Fortasyn Connect on cognition and related measures in prodromal Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we report the 24-month 
results of the trial.
Methods LipiDiDiet was a 24-month randomised, controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, multicentre trial (11 sites 
in Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden), with optional 12-month double-blind extensions. The trial 
enrolled individuals with prodromal Alzheimer’s disease, defined according to the International Working Group 
(IWG)-1 criteria. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to active product (125 mL once-a-day drink containing 
Fortasyn Connect) or control product. Randomisation was computer-generated centrally in blocks of four, stratified by 
site. All study personnel and participants were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was change 
in a neuropsychological test battery (NTB) score. Analysis was by modified intention to treat. Safety analyses included 
all participants who consumed at least one study product dose. This trial is registered with the Dutch Trial Register, 
number NTR1705.
Findings Between April 20, 2009, and July 3, 2013, 311 of 382 participants screened were randomly assigned to the 
active group (n=153) or control group (n=158). Mean change in NTB primary endpoint was –0·028 (SD 0·453) in the 
active group and –0·108 (0·528) in the control group; estimated mean treatment difference was 0·098 (95% CI 
–0·041 to 0·237; p=0·166). The decline in the control group was less than the prestudy estimate of –0·4 during 
24 months. 66 (21%) participants dropped out of the study. Serious adverse events occurred in 34 (22%) participants 
in the active group and 30 (19%) in control group (p=0·487), none of which were regarded as related to the study 
intervention.
Interpretation The intervention had no significant effect on the NTB primary endpoint over 2 years in prodromal 
Alzheimer’s disease. However, cognitive decline in this population was much lower than expected, rendering the 
primary endpoint inadequately powered. Group differences on secondary endpoints of disease progression measuring 
cognition and function and hippocampal atrophy were observed. Further study of nutritional approaches with larger 
sample sizes, longer duration, or a primary endpoint more sensitive in this pre-dementia population, is needed.

docosahexaenoic acid (DHA); eicosapentaenoic acid 
(EPA); uridine monophosphate; choline; vitamins B12, 
B6, C, E, and folic acid; phospholipids; and selenium.10 
These nutrients were selected based on their established 
biological and neuroprotective properties, and specifically 
combined to enhance efficacy compared with individual 
nutrients. The aim was to provide neuroprotection by 
targeting disease processes in early Alzheimer’s disease—
ie, by supplying rate-limiting compounds for brain 
phospholipid 
synthesis 
and 
addressing 
multiple 
Alzheimer’s disease-related pathological processes in 
vivo.11–17 Results from animal studies showed that this 
multinutrient 
combination 
improved 
neuronal 
membrane composition; increased the formation of 
synapses, cholinergic neurotransmission, and cerebral 
blood flow and perfusion; preserved neuronal integrity; 
restored hippocampal neurogenesis; reduced β-amyloid 
pathology; and improved cognition.15–21 Concentrations of 
these nutrients in plasma and CSF or the brain were also 
found to be lower in patients with Alzheimer’s disease.22 
For clinical use, Fortasyn Connect was adapted to address 
nutritional requirements in the presence of Alzheimer’s 
disease pathology. Two previous randomised clinical 
trials in patients with mild Alzheimer’s disease dementia 
reported that daily intake of Fortasyn Connect for 3 or 
6 months improved memory performance,23,24 increased 
neurophysiological measures of synaptic activity, and 
enhanced functional connectivity in the brain.24,25 A third 
randomised controlled trial26 in patients with mild-to-
moderate Alzheimer’s disease dementia did not report 
benefits, therefore, heterogeneity in the benefits of 
Fortasyn Connect exists in previous trials. All trials 
reported a positive safety profile23,24,27 and treatment was 
well tolerated in combination with Alzheimer’s disease 
medications.26 An analysis of these trials indicated that 
Fortasyn Connect can achieve clinically detectable effects 
in patients with mild Alzheimer’s disease dementia,28 but 
did not slow cognitive decline in mild-to-moderate 
Alzheimer’s disease dementia.26 Given the hypothesis 
that earlier intervention might be more beneficial, the 
LipiDiDiet trial was designed to investigate the effects of 
Fortasyn Connect on cognition and related measures in 
prodromal Alzheimer’s disease.
Methods
Study design and participants
The LipiDiDiet study was a 24-month randomised, 
controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, multicentre trial 
done in 11 study sites in Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, 
and Sweden (appendix) with one to four optional, 12-month, 
double-blind extension periods. Participants were primarily 
recruited from memory clinics and had routine 
assessments in the year before screening. The study was 
completed as planned. Here we report 24-month findings; 
extension studies are currently ongoing and will be 
reported later. We enrolled participants aged 55–85 years 
with a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 
24 points or higher (≥20 if education level ≤6 years) who 
fulfilled criteria for prodromal Alzheimer’s disease3 as 
defined by episodic memory disorder (performance below 
one standard deviation on two of eight cognitive tests [at 
least one on memory]) and evidence for underlying 
Alzheimer’s disease pathology based on positive findings 
from at least one of the following diagnostic tests: CSF, 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO’s International Clinical Trial 
Registry Platform, and PubMed (Jan 1, 1950, to Dec 20, 2016) 
using the search terms “Alzheimer’s disease” and “Fortasyn” or 
“Souvenaid”. There were no language restrictions. Only articles 
reporting clinical trials of Souvenaid or Fortasyn Connect in 
patients with Alzheimer’s disease were included. We identified 
three completed 12-week to 24-week randomised controlled 
trials: Souvenir I (225 drug-naive patients with mild Alzheimer’s 
disease dementia), Souvenir II (259 drug-naive patients with 
mild Alzheimer’s disease dementia), and S-Connect (527 patients 
with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease dementia treated 
with medications). Improved memory was reported in mild, but 
not mild-to-moderate, Alzheimer’s disease. The 
three randomised controlled trials reported that the intervention 
was well tolerated and had a good safety profile, both alone and 
in combination with Alzheimer’s disease medications. The 
LipiDiDiet trial differs from the previous trials of this 
multinutrient combination because it focuses on prodromal 
Alzheimer’s disease and tests a longer duration of the 
intervention.
Added value of this study
LipiDiDiet is the first completed long-term randomised 
controlled trial focusing on prodromal Alzheimer’s disease 
defined according to the International Working Group (IWG-1) 
criteria. Benefit was observed in relevant secondary 
cognitive-functional and brain atrophy outcome measures, but 
not in the primary neuropsychological test battery and other 
secondary measures including dementia diagnosis. Our findings 
support the hypothesis that intervening early in the disease 
continuum might achieve benefits more readily than late 
intervention.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our results emphasise the difficulty in finding adequately 
sensitive outcome measures for trials in prodromal Alzheimer’s 
disease. The potential for impact on disease progression, 
combined with the feasibility aspects including the observed high 
long-term compliance, moderate costs of the intervention, the 
potentially relative ease of implementation in clinical practise, as 
well as the clear need for treatment, warrant further research on 
multinutrient intervention in early Alzheimer’s disease.

MRI, and ¹⁸F fluorodeoxyglucose (¹⁸F-FDG) PET analysis 
(full list of inclusion criteria is in the appendix). We 
excluded participants with dementia according to 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th 
Edition (DSM-IV); historical use of donepezil, rivastigmine, 
galantamine, or memantine, use of omega-3 preparations, 
alcohol or drug abuse, major depressive disorders (DSM-
IV) or other concomitant serious conditions, intake of 
vitamins B6, B12, folic acid, vitamin C, or vitamin E of 
more than 200% of the recommended daily intake, those 
who participated in any other clinical trial in the last 
30 days, and with an MRI or CT scan consistent with a 
diagnosis of stroke, intracranial bleeding, mass lesion, or 
normal pressure hydrocephalus (minimal white matter 
changes and up to two lacunar infarcts judged to be 
clinically insignificant were allowed). Participants who 
progressed to dementia during the trial could remain in the 
trial and start approved Alzheimer’s disease medication, 
according to the clinician’s judgment. The protocol was 
amended to allow participants who progressed to dementia 
to switch to the active product after it became generally 
available (appendix). The study protocol and consent forms 
were approved by the local ethical committees of all 
participating sites, and all participants provided written 
informed consent before study participation. The study was 
done in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and 
International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical 
Practice guidelines.
Randomisation and masking
Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to 
receive either the active or control product once daily 
according to a randomisation list, which was computer 
generated by Nutricia Research, stratified by site, and in 
block sizes of four. Sealed opaque envelopes were 
available for each participant. After acceptance of a 
participant to the trial, the envelope with the lowest 
unused number was opened at the site, containing the 
code for that participant. The active and control products 
were isocaloric and similar in appearance and flavours 
(vanilla and strawberry). All study personnel and 
participants, including the investigators and study-site 
staff, were masked to treatment assignment. Only the 
trial-independent statistician and the independent data 
monitoring committee, who reviewed interim data for 
safety and efficacy purposes, were partially unmasked.
Procedures
We enrolled eligible participants at a combined screening 
and baseline visit or during a separate baseline visit. 
Efficacy evaluations were done at baseline, 6, 12, and 
24 months (appendix). Study sites received training on 
outcome assessments. Visits to the study nurse or 
physician were scheduled every 3 months during the first 
year and every 6 months thereafter. To maintain 
motivation, check compliance, and monitor safety, 
participants were contacted by phone throughout the 
trial (once per month during the first 6 months and every 
2 months thereafter). Study products were dispensed to 
the participants every 3 months. Participants in the active 
group were given the medical food Souvenaid, a 125 mL 
once-a-day drink containing the specific nutrient 
combination Fortasyn Connect (appendix). Participants 
in the control group were given a 125 mL once-a-day 
control drink. The study product was produced by 
Nutricia (Zoetermeer, the Netherlands).
Outcomes
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change over 
24 months in a composite score of cognitive performance 
based on a neuropsychological test battery (NTB; 
appendix),29 assessed by study neuropsychologists at each 
site at baseline and months 6, 12, and 24. Based on 
advances in Alzheimer’s disease research and results 
from a clinical trial with the active product,24 protocol 
amendments were made after the study started and 
before database lock to specify the composite scores of 
the NTB and to limit the number of secondary endpoints 
(appendix). The NTB primary endpoint was a composite 
Z score based on Consortium to Establish a Registry for 
Alzheimer’s disease (CERAD) 10-word list learning 
immediate recall, CERAD 10-word delayed recall, CERAD 
10-word recognition, category fluency, and letter digit 
substitution test (LDST). Secondary endpoints were NTB 
memory domain (composite Z score based on CERAD 
10-word list learning immediate recall, delayed recall, 
and recognition), NTB executive function domain 
(composite Z score based on category fluency, Wechsler 
Memory Scale revised digit span total score, concept 
shifting test condition C [corrected for the zero trials], 
and LDST), and NTB total (composite Z score based on 
all 16 items of the NTB). Composite scores were 
calculated as Z scores standardised to the baseline mean 
and 
SD, 
with 
higher 
scores 
suggesting 
better 
performance. Other secondary endpoints, assessed at 
baseline, month 12, and month 24, unless stated 
otherwise, were change from baseline over 24 months in 
clinical dementia rating-sum of boxes (CDR-SB), brain 
volumes based on MRI (three-dimensional T1-weighted 
anatomical scans of total hippocampal, whole-brain, and 
ventricular volumes; details of MRI acquisition and 
central analysis are in the appendix), progression to 
dementia (according to criteria defined by DSM-IV, the 
National Institute of Neurological and Communicative 
Disorders and Stroke, and the Alzheimer’s Disease and 
Related Disorders Association criteria for Alzheimer’s 
disease), serum concentrations of HDL cholesterol and 
LDL cholesterol, plasma fatty acids (DHA and EPA, 
assessed at baseline and months 3, 6, 12, and 24; for 
laboratory analysis, see appendix), and DHA in CSF 
(CSF analysis not yet finalised). Safety assessments 
included adverse events, use of concomitant medications, 
consumption of nutritional supplements, study product 
compliance, vital signs (heart rate, systolic blood

pressure, and diastolic blood pressure), and clinical 
safety laboratory tests. To monitor product compliance, 
we asked participants to record the amount of study 
product taken in a daily diary, which was collected at each 
visit. Study product compliance was defined as the 
percentage of study product used throughout the study 
period compared with the prescribed dosage. Compliance 
was calculated only for participants who completed the 
study product diary for at least 75% of their actual study 
time. An additional sensitivity calculation was done to 
include all available data up to the start of rescue 
medication (defined as use of active product or approved 
Alzheimer’s disease medication after progression to 
dementia). In both calculations, missing diary intake 
entries were assumed to be 0. We coded adverse events 
with the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(version 18.0).
Statistical analyses
Based on a t test and 5% significance level, we calculated 
that a sample size of 300 randomly assigned participants 
would be sufficient to provide 90% power to detect a 
40% difference in NTB score change between groups at 
the end of the study. Based on results from a study in 
patients with mild Alzheimer’s disease dementia,29 we 
expected the NTB Z score in the control group to decrease 
by –0·4 (SD 0·4) during 24 months. The sample size 
allowed for 20% dropout. We did a prespecified, blinded 
re-estimation of the SD to assess the adequacy of the 
calculated sample size. Representatives of the LipiDiDiet 
Consortium reviewed the SDs calculated from the interim 
dataset and concluded that they matched the estimated 
SDs in the protocol. Additionally, we amended the 
protocol to do an interim analysis for safety (occurrence 
of adverse events) and efficacy after approximately a third 
of participants completed the study. Between-group 
analyses on partially unmasked data were done by the 
trial-independent statistician and results were reviewed 
by the independent data monitoring committee, which 
recommended continuation of the study without 
modification.
We obtained NTB composite Z scores by averaging the 
individual NTB items’ Z scores and weighting according 
to the number of NTB items available. The minimum 
number of NTB items required was set to four of five for 
NTB primary endpoint, three of three for NTB memory 
domain, three of four for NTB executive function domain, 
and 12 of 16 for NTB total. Analyses were done on the 
modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population of all 
participants randomly assigned, excluding data after the 
start of rescue medication. We did per-protocol analyses 
on all participants from the mITT population, excluding 
the respective visits of participants with major protocol 
deviations defined during a data review of masked data. 
The most common reason for exclusion from the per-
protocol analysis was substantial irregular study product 
intake (appendix). All randomised participants who 
consumed at least one dose of study product were 
included in safety analyses. To allow for separate 
evaluation of safety data collected before and after a 
switch to active study product after progression to 
dementia, analyses were done in two safety phases: the 
double-blind treatment phase and active treatment phase.
We analysed the primary endpoint and all secondary 
endpoints of a continuous type as prespecified in the 
statistical analysis plan, using a linear mixed model for 
longitudinal data with change from baseline as the 
response variable and linear time (days since baseline), 
baseline score, randomised treatment, and time × treatment

as fixed effects. This is a multi-level model with three 
levels: measurements, participants, and sites. We used a 
random intercept with a variance components covariance 
structure within sites (small sites were pooled within 
country) and a random intercept and slope for time with 
an unstructured covariance structure within participants. 
Other covariance structures could be applied in case of 
converging issues. This model’s estimated difference 
between the active and control groups in terms of mean 
change from baseline at month 24 was used as the primary 
indication of treatment effect during the 24-month 
intervention 
period. 
A 
baseline 
measurement 
or 
characteristic that showed an imbalance between the 
groups and was found to be a significant predictor for 
outcome parameters was considered a prognostic factor 
and included in the statistical models. We did a planned 
sensitivity analysis using a mixed model for repeated 
measures with change from baseline as the response 
variable and time as categorical (planned visit), baseline 
score, randomised treatment, and time × treatment as fixed 
effects. In this analysis, treatment effects were evaluated 
for each timepoint separately without assuming a 
treatment effect that increases linearly over time. We did 
an additional sensitivity analysis on participants who 
completed the 24-month study by using an analysis of 
covariance completer analysis with change from baseline 
as outcome, treatment as fixed factor, and baseline score as 
a covariate. We did an additional sensitivity analysis taking 
into account missing data due to dropout using a joint 
model. The joint model combined a mixed model 
comparable to our original model (mixed model) with a 
Cox proportional hazards model for time to dropout 
(appendix). We did a predefined subgroup analysis in 
participants with MMSE score 26 or higher at baseline 
using the same statistical models as for the primary and 
secondary endpoints. We aligned rules for visit windows 
between the statistical models to allow a visit window 
of 3 months (before and after scheduled visit date) for 
all visits.
p values of less than 0·05 were deemed statistically 
significant in comparisons of efficacy and safety data. 
Statistical analyses were done with SAS software 
(version 9.4). The study is registered with the Dutch Trial 
Register, number NTR1705.
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. HS, AS, PJV, SBH, KB, MK, and TH had full 
access to all the data in the study. The corresponding 
author had final responsibility for the decision to submit 
for publication.
Results
Between April 20, 2009, and July 3, 2013, 311 participants 
of 382 screened were randomly assigned to either the 
active group (n=153) or the control group (n=158; figure 1). 
Dropout was 22% in the active group and 21% in the 
control group (p=0·891, Fisher’s exact test), with no 
significant difference in time to dropout between groups. 
The main reasons for dropout were adverse events (n=15; 
appendix), withdrawal of informed consent (n=18), or 
other reasons (n=28). Five participants died during the 
study: four in the active group due to respiratory failure 
(n=2), bronchial carcinoma (n=1), and infection (n=1); 
and one in the control group due to sudden death with no 
apparent cause. All deaths were assessed as not related to 
the study product. Mean age was 71·0 years, and 154 (50%) 
of 311 participants were men. Further baseline 
characteristics of study participants are shown in table 1.

Association (NIA-AA) criteria.3–5 The active and control 
groups were similar at baseline (table 1), except for MMSE 
score. Baseline MMSE was also found to be a significant 
predictor of outcome parameters, which made it a 
potential prognostic factor; therefore, it was included as a 
covariate in all statistical models except MMSE subgroup 
analyses.
Primary and main secondary endpoints are reported in 
table 2, in which higher scores indicate better 
performance for all endpoints except for CDR-SB and 
ventricular volume. Mean change from baseline to 
month 24 in the NTB primary endpoint was –0·108 
(SD 0·528) in the control group, and –0·028 (SD 0·453) 
in the active group. The decline in the control group was 
lower than the prestudy estimate of –0·4 during 
24 months. There was no statistically significant 
difference between groups for the primary endpoint 
(estimated mean treatment difference of 0·098, 95% CI 
–0·041 to 0·237; p=0·166). Similarly, there were no 
statistically significant differences when the analyses 
were done without adjustment for baseline MMSE 
(appendix) and in the sensitivity analysis (table 2).
No statistically significant differences were observed 
for the secondary NTB composite scores. For CDR-SB, 
there was significantly less worsening in the active group 
than in the control group during 24 months (p=0·005; 
table 2, figure 2C). Similar results were obtained without 
adjustment for baseline MMSE (appendix) and in the 
sensitivity analysis (table 2). The worsening in CDR-SB 
was 45% less in the active group than in the control 
group, based on the estimated change from baseline over 
24 months.

active group than in the control group (table 2, figure 2D, 
2E). The rates of deterioration were lower in the active 
group than in the control group, both for hippocampal 
(26%) and ventricular volumes (16%). Sensitivity analyses 
confirmed these observations for hippocampal volume 
and ventricular volume. No statistically significant 
differences between groups were found for changes in 
whole brain volume (table 2).
During the 24-month trial period, 59 (37%) participants 
in the control group and 62 (41%) in the active group were 
diagnosed with dementia (p=0·642, Fisher’s exact test; 
appendix). HDL cholesterol concentration significantly 
increased in the active group compared with the control 
group, but absolute changes were very small (<5%), and 
no differences between groups were found for changes in 
LDL cholesterol over 24 months (appendix).
Differences in cognition-related scores between groups 
were more pronounced in per-protocol analyses than in 
the mITT analyses, particularly for the NTB primary 
endpoint and the NTB memory domain (table 2; 
appendix). There were no differences in baseline 
characteristics between active and control groups among 
participants included in the per-protocol analyses 
(appendix). Forest plots showing an overview of the mITT 
and per-protocol results from the different statistical 
models are provided in the appendix.
Predefined subgroup analyses (MMSE score ≥26) in 
mITT and per-protocol populations are shown in the 
appendix. We observed statistically significant differences 
between groups for CDR-SB and hippocampal volume in 
the mITT population, and for the NTB primary endpoint 
(mixed model p=0·131, sensitivity analysis p=0·044) and 
NTB memory domain (mixed model p=0·073, sensitivity 
analysis p=0·017) in the per-protocol population. Baseline 
MMSE was an effect modifier for CDR-SB in the per-
protocol 
population 
(mixed 
model 
p=0·053 
for 
interaction term treatment effect × baseline MMSE). 
Therefore, we did an exploratory analysis of CDR-SB 
performance across the spectrum of baseline MMSE 
(≥24 to ≥29), which suggested that the treatment effect 
on CDR-SB increased with higher baseline MMSE scores 
(figure 2F; appendix).

Self-reported adherence to the intervention was high, 
both when calculated in all participants (mean 93·4% 
[SD 8·8] in both groups) and when calculated using all 
available data in the mITT (excluding data collected after 
starting rescue medication: mean 87·3% [SD 22·9] in 
active and 86·8% [23·4] in control). This adherence was 
confirmed by significant biochemical changes in plasma 
DHA and EPA during 24 months in the active group 
compared with no changes in the control group (p<0·0001; 
appendix). The incidences of adverse events and serious 
adverse events were similar between groups (p=0·864 and 
p=0·487; table 3), and among the 66 participants who 
dropped out (active vs control: 24 [73%] vs 22 [67%], 
p=0·789 and 8 [24%] vs three [9%], p=0·185). None of the 
serious adverse events were regarded as related to the 
study product and dropout due to adverse events was not 
significantly different between groups (nine [6%] in the 
active group vs six [4%] in the control group, p=0·437).
Discussion
Prodromal Alzheimer’s disease is a new area of 
Alzheimer’s disease research, with clinical research 
practices still under development. LipiDiDiet is the first 
randomised, 
controlled, 
double-blind, 
multicentre, 
international trial of a non-pharmacological intervention 
in prodromal Alzheimer’s disease. No significant 
difference was found between groups for the NTB 
primary endpoint in the mITT analysis or on conversion 
to dementia. However, there was some evidence of a 
beneficial effect of the multinutrient intervention at the 
cognitive-functional level (detected by CDR-SB) and 
ameliorated structural brain changes (hippocampal and 
ventricular volume) shown on MRI scans.
The LipiDiDiet study was initiated shortly after the first 
criteria for prodromal Alzheimer’s disease were 
published.3 It has since become clear that changes in 
cognitive performance with currently used tests are not 
very pronounced in early Alzheimer’s disease during 
time intervals close to 2 years.30,31 The study design was 
based on a previous 12-month trial in Alzheimer’s 
disease dementia;29 however, in our study, the control 
group had only a quarter of the projected 24-month 
decline on the NTB primary endpoint, possibly because 
of the earlier disease stage of the pre-dementia 
participants than those with Alzheimer’s disease 
dementia. The lower than expected decline is in 
agreement with the previous observations of limited 
cognitive changes over 2 years. The small cognitive 
decline on the NTB primary endpoint in the control 
group was mainly due to stable performance during the 
first year of intervention, followed by a steeper decline in 
the second year. Conversely, CDR-SB scores had already 
significantly declined at month 12 in the control group. 
Therefore, in mITT analyses, the significant benefit on 
CDR-SB was combined with an absence of clear effects 
on NTB cognition endpoints, although benefits on the 
NTB primary endpoint and the NTB memory domain 
were suggested in the per-protocol analyses. Notably, the 
main reason for exclusion from the per-protocol analysis 
was no or irregular intake of study product, which 
emphasises the importance of sustained intake, as 
observed previously.27,32
The effect on CDR-SB in the LipiDiDiet trial differs 
from previous mild Alzheimer’s disease dementia trials 
by adding a benefit at the cognitive-functional level.23,24 
The longer treatment duration and intervention at an 
earlier disease stage than in the previous dementia trials 
might be important reasons for this observation. The 
apparently more pronounced stabilisation of CDR-SB 
scores with increasing baseline MMSE observed in the 
active group indicates that early rather than late treatment 
within the prodromal stage might support better 
outcome with this cognitive-functional measure, in line 
with previous results from Fortasyn Connect trials,23,24,26 
which showed that earlier intervention might increase 
the benefit. Within the disease continuum, early 
intervention might also be an important contributory 
factor to the similarity in progression to dementia in 
both treatment groups, because participants at baseline

were only 2 years or less from advancing to dementia and 
therefore treatment efficacy might not have been 
sufficient to translate into less conversion to dementia. 
Moreover, dementia diagnosis was clustered at major 
study visits. Dementia diagnosis is a dichotomisation of 
the decline continuum, whereas CDR-SB is a sensitive 
measure of decline across a continuous scale. Therefore, 
CDR-SB might better reflect disease progression along 
our entire prodromal population.
No cognitive test is generally accepted as the gold 
standard for trials in prodromal Alzheimer’s disease, 
although 
research 
has 
highlighted 
the 
potential 
usefulness of composite measures.33 Use of compound 
cognitive test batteries such as NTB combining 
performance on different validated tests have been 
suggested to help detection of more subtle changes that 
occur in pre-dementia disease stages.34 In the meantime, 
preliminary 
guidelines 
from 
regulatory 
agencies 
emphasise the importance of establishing the clinical 
value of treatment and suggest using a combined 
cognitive-functional measure such as CDR-SB, which 
showed reliability and validity in prodromal Alzheimer’s 
disease and mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer’s 
disease, and proposed CDR-SB as a single primary 
endpoint for efficacy.35,36 However, this information was 
not available at the time of our trial design.
Although it is generally difficult to translate performance 
on cognitive tests into clinical benefits, the CDR-SB is 
built on real-life items such as handling household 
emergencies, 
handling 
financial 
transactions, 
and 
forgetting a major event, which facilitates assessment of 
clinical benefit. For early Alzheimer’s disease, a reduction 
by 0·5 or 1·0 in CDR-SB was proposed to capture both 
efficacy and clinical relevance.1 The current emphasis on 
using more sensitive cognitive or functional measures in 
ongoing trials in prodromal Alzheimer’s disease is a 
major shift from the previous focus on progression to 
dementia used in unsuccessful trials in mild cognitive 
impairment.33
In addition to the CDR-SB cognition-function benefit, 
we observed benefits on progression of structural 
changes in the brain. The hippocampus is affected early 
in Alzheimer’s disease, and the rate of hippocampal 
atrophy over time is considered a reliable measure of 
Alzheimer’s disease progression.4 We noted 26% less 
reduction in hippocampal volume in the active group 
compared with the control group and the active group 
also had 16% less increase in ventricular volume, 
suggesting an interaction of the treatment with the 
disease process. Interaction could be hypothesised based 
on animal and mild cognitive impairment studies that 
showed effects on Alzheimer’s disease-related brain 
pathologies.9,10
Prodromal Alzheimer’s disease was defined according 
to the IWG-1 criteria.3 Currently, three sets of research 
criteria are available for Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis in 
people with mild cognitive impairment: IWG-1,3 IWG-2,4 
and NIA-AA5 criteria. Comparative analysis showed that 
all three predict cognitive decline with reasonable 
accuracy.37 Baseline characteristics in our study were as 
expected for a prodromal Alzheimer’s disease population, 
including the CSF biomarker profile; percentage of 
APOE ε4 carriers; and IWG-1, IWG-2, and NIA-AA 
criteria (appendix). The main differences between the 
IWG-1 and IWG-2 criteria are the definition of in-vivo 
evidence of Alzheimer’s disease pathology (medial 
temporal lobe atrophy on MRI is included in IWG-1, but 
not in IWG-2) and the clinical Alzheimer’s disease 
phenotypes (IWG-1 focuses on a typical amnestic 
phenotype, whereas IWG-2 also includes atypical, non-
amnestic phenotypes). Thus, we cannot make inferences 
on intervention effects in prodromal Alzheimer’s disease 
with atypical, non-amnestic phenotypes. This study 
indicates that populations within prodromal Alzheimer’s 
disease exist who might benefit differently from early 
intervention. Baseline MMSE scores and decline in 
cognitive function contributed to different levels of 
benefit; further currently unknown factors might 
contribute as well. Identification of those individuals 
could aid in the ongoing process of refining prodromal 
Alzheimer’s 
disease 
definition 
and 
prodromal 
Alzheimer’s disease clinical trial design.
As expected from previous trials,23,24,26 study product 
compliance was high, and adverse events and serious 
adverse events were consistent with the studied population 
and the known safety profile of the active product.23,24,26 The 
proportion of participants with at least one serious adverse 
event (34 [22%] in the active group and 30 [19%] in the 
control group) and percentage of dropouts due to adverse 
events (nine [6%] in the active group and six [4%] in the 
control group) in our study are in the same range as those 
reported by Coric and colleagues38 for the control group 
(31 [23.7%] patients with at least one serious adverse event 
and 13 [9.9%] dropouts due to adverse events).
Our study has some limitations. First, cognitive decline 
in this prodromal Alzheimer’s disease population was 
much lower than expected, rendering the primary 
endpoint inadequately powered. Therefore, future trials 
aiming to implement this NTB endpoint might benefit 
from larger sample sizes and a longer duration of 
intervention than used in our study, or a cognitive 
composite designed for this pre-dementia population. 
Second, our 24-month trial was not designed with 
progression to dementia as a primary focus, thereby 
limiting the ability to draw conclusions on this outcome. 
Additionally, use of MRI as an alternative to CSF or PET 
amyloid assessments might have resulted in a somewhat 
more heterogeneous group of participants, because 
medial temporal atrophy on MRI can be both amyloid-
related and non-amyloid-related.4 Finally, we included a 
demographically restricted population, largely comprising 
white participants from central European countries and 
Scandinavia. Participants completing the 24-month 
intervention were eligible to continue in the double-blind

extension studies, which will provide additional data on 
long-term efficacy.
In conclusion, the multinutrient intervention had no 
significant effect on the NTB primary endpoint over 
2 years in prodromal Alzheimer’s disease, although 
potential benefits were seen on the cognitive-functional 
measure CDR-SB and brain atrophy measures. Further 
investigation of multinutrient approaches in early 
Alzheimer’s disease stages is warranted.
Contributors
HS, AS, PJV, KB, MK, and TH contributed to the design of the study. 
HS, AS, PJV, MK, and TH were members of the LipiDiDiet Trial 
Steering Committee; TH was the chairman. HS, AS, PJV, and MK 
contributed to data collection. PJV coordinated the central MRI analyses. 
KB coordinated the central CSF analyses. HS, AS, PJV, SBH, MK, and 
TH contributed to the development and implementation of the statistical 
analysis plan. SBH was responsible for data management and statistical 
analysis of the trial data. All authors were involved in data interpretation, 
drafting, review, and approval of the report, and the decision to submit 
for publication.
