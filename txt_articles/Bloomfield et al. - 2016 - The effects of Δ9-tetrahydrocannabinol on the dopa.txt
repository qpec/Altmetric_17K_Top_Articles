Preface
Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, is a pressing 
concern to global mental health. Patterns of use are changing drastically due to legalisation, 
availability of synthetic analogues (‘spice’), cannavaping and aggrandizements in the purported 
therapeutic effects of cannabis. Many of THC’s reinforcing effects are mediated by the dopamine 
system. Due to complex cannabinoid-dopamine interactions there is conflicting evidence from 
human and animal research fields. Acute THC causes increased dopamine release and neuron 
activity, whilst long-term use is associated with blunting of the dopamine system. Future research 
must examine the long-term and developmental dopaminergic effects of the drug.
Introduction
Cannabis is a widely used recreational drug. Over half of young Americans have used the 
drug1. In Europe cannabis has now overtaken heroin as the most widely reported illegal drug 
used amongst people entering specialist addiction services2. At the same time, political

 debates about changes to the legal status of the drug continue internationally. Although 
causality has not been conclusively demonstrated, heavy cannabis use is associated with 
increased risk of mental disorder3 including psychosis4, addiction5, depression6, 
suicidality7, cognitive impairment8 and amotivation9.
Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabis’ main psychoactive component10, elicits its acute 
psychoactive effects via the endocannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor (CB1R)11. THC has 
been linked to the rewarding aspects of cannabis and the induction of symptoms of mental 
illnesses and cognitive impairment. Lately the THC content of cannabis has been 
increasing12, synthetic THC analogues (potent cannabinoid agonists; termed ‘spice’) are 
now widely used13. The future consumption of cannabinoids through electronic cigarettes 
(‘cannavaping’) and edible products14 changes the landscape further15. Given the 
widespread use of cannabinoids, and the links between THC exposure and adverse 
outcomes, it is imperative to understand the neurobiological effects of THC. Recently, we 
and others have found that heavy cannabis use is associated with reductions in dopaminergic 
function. Since the rewarding and psychotogenic effects of THC and its analogues are 
thought to be mediated by the dopaminergic system, demonstrating dopaminergic alterations 
in vivo in human users is of clinical relevance for the prevention and treatment of cannabis 
use disorders and psychoses. Therefore, we review the animal and human literature on the 
complex effects of acute and longer-term THC on dopamine synthesis, release, and its 
receptors, critically analysing the factors that contribute to effects, and variations between 
studies, before finally providing a framework for future research including 
pharmacologically dissecting these effects, especially in the developing brain.
THC receptor binding in the brain
THC is a CB1R and endocannabinoid type 2 receptor (CB2R) partial agonist11. The 
psychoactive effects of THC are blocked by the CB1R antagonist rimonabant16,17 
indicating that these are mediated through activating G-protein-coupled CB1R receptors 
which reduce cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels by inhibiting adenylate 
cyclase18. THC disrupts finely-tuned endocannabinoid retrograde signalling systems due to 
the temporal and neuronal specificity of endocannabinoids over THC. Under conditions of 
low CB1R density, THC antagonises endogenous agonists possessing greater receptor 
efficacy than THC19. THC also allosterically modulates opioid receptors20, which may 
provide additional indirect routes for altering dopamine transmission21. Furthermore, THC 
has psychoactive metabolites with CB1R affinity, further complicating the analyses of 
receptor binding studies22.
CB1 receptors and dopamine
Early animal studies described the interactions of amphetamine, which increases dopamine 
release, and THC23. These reported that amphetamine’s behavioural effects were 
potentiated or antagonised depending on the dose of THC leading researchers24 to propose 
that dopamine was “a prime candidate for…the mode of action of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol”. 
Indeed, THC produces complex effects on the dopamine system, contributing to the drug’s 
recreational and harmful effects. However, there are inconsistencies between the preclinical 
and clinical findings which challenge the field. It is thus timely to review the evidence and

 provide a framework for understanding the inconsistencies between the preclinical and 
clinical findings.
Dopaminergic neurons are modulated by the endocannabinoid system (eCBS)25. CB1Rs and 
the endocannabinoid ligands anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) are abundant 
in dopaminergic pathways including the striatum26 where they act as a retrograde feedback 
system on presynaptic glutamatergic and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) nerve terminals (Fig. 
1) to modulate dopamine transmission. Anandamide27 and 2-AG28 stimulate dopamine 
release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell. This effect is blocked by the CB1 antagonist 
rimonabant, indicating that dopaminergic effects of endocannabinoids involve CB1 
receptors. The rewarding properties of THC via increased dopamine release and 
dopaminergic neuron firing are underpinned by biased signal transduction mechanisms from 
the CB1R16. There is evidence of differential effects of acute vs. chronic THC exposure on 
the dopaminergic system. Therefore, we will treat these separately and describe the effects 
on different neurobiological components of the dopaminergic system including neuron 
firing, synthesis, release, reuptake and receptors.
Acute THC and presynaptic dopamine in animals
From the outset it was clear that THC exerts complex effects on the dopamine system. Early 
in vitro studies in rodents using radiolabelled dopamine in synaptosomes found that THC 
caused increased dopamine synthesis31 and release24 (Fig. 2). However, the effects on 
dopamine uptake yielded conflicting results, with evidence of both increases32 and dose-
dependent decreases24. Subsequently biphasic and triphasic effects of THC were 
discovered, whereby low doses of THC produced increases in the conversion of tyrosine to 
dopamine, but high doses of THC resulted in decreased dopamine synthesis33. Likewise, 
complicated temporal relationships between THC administration and changes in dopamine 
levels were observed34, such that repeated dosing results in behavioural and neurochemical 
tolerance –highly pertinent to the mechanisms of dependence to the drug. The complex 
dose-specific effects of THC in rodents were thought to be due to dose-related decreases in 
precursor uptake32 and dopamine-opioid interactions via μ-opioid receptors31.
Subsequent work investigated THC-induced increases in dopamine synthesis in vivo. THC 
increased [3H]-dopamine synthesis35,36, tyrosine hydroxylase37 and messenger ribonucleic 
acid (mRNA) expression38, the rate-limiting step in the dopamine synthesis pathway. 
Similarly, increases in dopamine metabolism, measured with the dihydroxphenylacetic acid/
dopamine (DOPAC/DA) ratio, were reported in most39 but not all37 rodent studies. 
However, the majority of early studies using spectrophotofluorimetry were inconsistent due 
to technical limitations in detecting the rapid changes in extracellular dopamine 
concentration detectable by microdialysis techniques used more recently40.
In vivo microdialysis shows that acute THC increases dopamine efflux in the prefrontal 
cortex (PFC)41, striatum42 and nucleus accumbens (NAc)43. Only one study did not find 
THC–induced increases in dopamine efflux44, which may have been related to route of 
administration since that study used a THC gavage whereas the other studies used 
intravenous injection which produces a rapid increase in THC which reaches the brain

 promptly compared to gavage which favours sequestration in lipid compartments due to the 
very high lipid solubility of THC45. Differences in microdialysis results are associated with 
the strain of experimental rat46. Electrophysiological studies in rats have categorically 
demonstrated that THC dose-dependently increases firing rates in ascending midbrain 
dopaminergic projections via CB1R agonism47,48. Taken together, these findings suggest 
THC increases the firing rates of dopamine neurons which leads to increased dopamine 
synthesis and release in terminal fields.
Acute THC and post-synaptic dopamine in animals
Acute THC did not alter dopamine receptor proteins levels in rhesus monkeys49. In the rat 
limbic forebrain, one study reported increased dopamine type 1 receptor (D1R) 
availability50 whilst other studies reported decreases51. In the striatum, dopamine type 2 
receptor (D2R) density showed either a decrease51 or no significant changes, whilst 
decreases in D1R have been reported50. Taken together, the findings of no change in 
receptor protein levels together with a tendency for reduced receptor availability most likely 
reflects THC-induced changes in synaptic dopamine levels. .
Acute THC and dopamine in humans
Studies of metabolic brain activity in humans using functional magnetic resonance imaging 
(fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) provide indirect measures of dopaminergic 
function through changes in cerebral blood flow and glucose metabolism. These serve as 
surrogate markers of brain activity in areas with dopaminergic projections. In humans, acute 
THC is associated with increased activity in frontal and sub-cortical regions52. However, as 
the CB1R has the highest concentrations in these regions53 these findings may be due to 
direct endocannabinoid effects rather than reflecting dopamine-mediated processes. When 
studies of acute THC on resting brain activity have focussed on regions with dense 
dopaminergic innervation, such as the striatum, there have been inconsistent effects, with 
reports of both increased and reduced activity52. However, certain cognitive tasks are 
modulated by dopaminergic signalling and may provide a more robust proxy for THC-
induced changes in dopaminergic transmission. For example, motor response inhibition is 
associated with cortical dopamine release and an fMRI study in healthy humans with 
previous exposure to cannabis found that THC attenuates activation in the right inferior 
frontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during suppression of motor 
inhibition54. Further indirect evidence of blunted dopaminergic processing comes from a 
study in healthy humans with previous exposure to cannabis using a verbal working memory 
task whereby THC attenuated striatal activation55 and a study of reward function in 
occasional cannabis users, which found that THC induced a widespread attenuation of the 
brain response to feedback in reward trials56 but not under reward anticipation conditions56.
It is also possible to directly measure the dopamine system using molecular imaging. These 
studies have examined the effect of acute THC on dopamine in humans with previous 
exposure to cannabis in vivo. Using PET, a combined analysis57 of two previous studies has 
shown that THC does indeed cause dopamine release in the ventral striatum in the human 
brain57. Likewise, acute THC challenge elicited dopamine release in fronto-temporal 
cortical brain regions58, although this finding requires replication with radiotracers that

 show higher affinity for cortical dopamine receptors. However, in a separate study using 
single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) no significant THC-induced 
dopamine release was observed,59 which may be due to a relatively small sample size (n=9). 
This is because THC-induced dopamine release in the striatum appears to be of a lower 
magnitude than that caused by other drugs such as amphetamine and methylphenidate60, 
combined with difficulties in imaging dopamine changes that are comparatively small61.
Repeated THC and pre-synaptic dopamine
Studies of repeated THC dosing have yielded complex, regionally-specific effects including 
increased total striatal dopamine levels62 in rats but reduced hippocampal63 dopamine 
levels in mice. Reduced dopamine metabolism was found in the medial PFC in two rat 
studies62, an effect which was not observed in the striatum or the NAc64. THC 
administration for 21 days down-regulated tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA expression in the 
substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area (VTA) midbrain nuclei, but not in the cortex or 
striatum65. In the NAc, several studies have reported that multiple THC doses do not 
significantly change dopamine release66 in rats. However, this may be due to differential 
dopaminergic responses within the NAc, as in one rat study repeated THC doses led to 
increased dopamine release in the NAc core but decreased release in the NAc shell67. The 
picture is further complicated by genetic strain effects whereby increased dopamine release 
in the NAc was observed in Lewis but not Fischer 344 rat strains68. Taken together, these 
studies indicate that repeated THC dosing produces regionally-specific effects on dopamine 
function.
Human studies in cannabis users
Several molecular imaging studies of dopaminergic function have been conducted in human 
cannabis users. Using PET, dopamine synthesis capacity was reduced in cannabis users69. 
Importantly, this reduction was driven by users meeting clinical criteria for abuse or 
dependence and was related to the severity of cannabis use (Fig. 3). Likewise, in two 
separate studies, cannabis users displayed reduced dopamine release to a stimulant challenge 
which was inversely related to severity of cannabis use70 and cognitive deficits including 
poor working memory71. Since no alteration in amphetamine-induced dopamine release was 
seen in recently abstinent cannabis users72, this effect is likely related to active use of the 
drug. While chronic use was not associated with altered stress-induced dopamine release73, 
there was evidence of a positive relationship between duration of cannabis use and stress-
induced dopamine release in the limbic striatum73. Likewise, there is recent data showing 
that cannabis users have an attenuated metabolic response to methylphenidate challenge in 
the striatum, with a negative relationship between methylphenidate-induced metabolic 
increases and severity of cannabis use74. There is also evidence of reduced dopamine 
transporter (DAT) density in chronic cannabis users75. Whilst the interpretation of some of 
these studies is complicated by cannabis users also smoking tobacco, a recent experiment 
has addressed this by studying cannabis users without comorbid substance dependence, to 
show that cannabis users do indeed have reduced dopamine release71. Overall there is 
converging evidence for reduced presynaptic dopaminergic function in cannabis users.

 Repeated THC and post-synaptic dopamine
Studies in rats have reported that multiple THC dosing results in increased D2R availability 
in the midbrain, striatum and PFC65,77 and that this is associated with dopamine receptor 
sensitisation. There is further evidence of downstream dopaminergic effects of THC, as one 
study in rats78 reported up-regulated postsynaptic dopamine receptor signalling in the NAc 
via increased adenylyl cyclase activity, which was proposed to underlie THC-induced 
changes in amphetamine-induced locomotive behaviour. These findings suggest that 
repeated THC dosing results in altered dopamine receptor signal transduction.
Dose-dependent increases in burst firing in the VTA in response to multiple THC 
administrations have been reported in nearly all murine electrophysiological studies48, with 
one exception79. In the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), multiple THC dosing was 
associated with increased firing, although this was smaller in magnitude than in the 
VTA80,81. This suggests that VTA and SNpc dopamine neurons develop a differential 
response to repeated THC exposures. There also appears to be an effect of withdrawal from 
multiple THC doses whereby decreased firing is elicited by abrupt cessation of repeated 
THC or administration of the CB1R antagonist SR141716A82.
Recent human studies in current and abstinent ex-cannabis users have found no significant 
difference in striatal D2R availability compared to individuals with no history of chronic 
cannabis use70–72,83–85. However, there was an inverse relationship between age of first 
cannabis use and D2R availability in one study72 and an inverse relationship with current 
cannabis use in another study83, suggestive of possible dose-effects or susceptibility to drug 
use.
THC exposure and dopamine cell morphology
In addition to changes in function, there is evidence from studies in rodents that THC 
exposure causes abnormalities in the structure of dopamine neurons. These morphological 
effects are region-specific and include reductions across a range of measures of neuronal cell 
size in the VTA86,87 and increased neuronal arborisation in the NAc shell and frontal 
cortex88.
Developmental THC exposure and dopamine
Adolescence is an important time for brain development and adolescent cannabinoid 
exposure has consequences in adulthood89. The eCBS plays an important role in brain 
development90 and developmental THC exposure produces complex alterations in the 
dopamine system which are apparent from an early stage. For example, gestational THC 
exposure is associated with increased foetal brain tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA expression in 
rats91 and changes in dopamine receptor gene expression. THC exposure in early 
development was associated with increased cortical D2R availability92. In rats, exposure 
from gestational day 5 to post-natal day 21 resulted in decreased NAc D2R gene (DRD2) 
mRNA. Likewise, human maternal cannabis use was associated with decreased foetal NAc 
DRD2 mRNA93. Early life exposure to THC also blunts the dopaminergic response to 
stimuli that release dopamine later in life, such as stress and amphetamine. This was seen in 
Bloomfield et al.

 the hypothalamus, striatum and limbic forebrain94, and frontal cortex95. In a study of CB1R 
agonist self-administration in rats96, THC exposure during adolescence enhanced the 
reinforcing effects of cannabinoids in adulthood, suggesting that exposure to THC during 
adolescence increased addiction potential during a critical period of development. 
Importantly, THC-exposed rodents had a reduced capacity for cannabinoid induced 
increases in firing of dopaminergic neurons, consistent with a blunting of the dopamine 
response in adulthood.
Inconsistencies between animal and human work
Preclinical evidence shows that acute THC increases in nerve firing rates and animal studies 
using microdialysis indicate that acute THC challenge causes dopamine release, yet the 
results of experiments from human studies have not been consistent97,98. There are a 
number of factors, which may underlie the inconsistencies in the results of the studies 
presented above.
The animal evidence indicates that there are highly region-specific differences in dopamine 
activity following THC administration including differential dopaminergic responses in the 
shell and core of the NAc67. However, whilst human PET imaging provides a reliable 
measure of dopaminergic function in the striatum61, the spatial resolution of most PET 
cameras is approximately 4 mm which limits its accuracy for measuring activity in small 
brain volumes (such as the core and shell of the NAc) due to partial volume and spillover 
effects99. For the foreseeable future, therefore, human in vivo imaging techniques lack the 
spatial resolution to detect these complex effects on different parts of the dopamine pathway 
and research on living complex human brain tissue in vitro raises significant ethical 
challenges100.
A further possibility underlying the lack of consistent dopamine release in the human studies 
is that the dose of THC used in human imaging studies has not been sufficient to 
consistently elicit measurable dopamine release. Human studies all administered 10mg or 
less of THC because older pharmacological studies indicated that the “standard joint” 
(defined by the US National Institute on Drug Abuse) delivered an approximate THC dose 
of 8mg-15mg, equivalent to about 170 micrograms/kg101. These doses are significantly less 
than those used in animal microdialysis studies, which are typically around 1 mg/kg. 
Likewise, the THC content of cannabis has increased significantly since early clinical 
studies102, such that THC doses may be over 40mg per spliff (joint; cannabis cigarette)103, 
so the doses that were used in the published imaging studies no longer reflects typical THC 
exposure in cannabis users. The picture is further complicated by animal data which indicate 
that THC exerts complex dose-dependent effects on the dopamine system33 and the dose-
response profile for THC-induced dopamine release has not been investigated in humans so 
it remains possible that human imaging is missing peak dopamine changes. Likewise, 
heterogeneity in the animal data may be a reflection of time of sampling in relation to THC 
treatment. For example, repeated daily THC administration led to an initial decrease in 
dopamine levels followed by a gradual return to baseline in brains that were studied one 
hour after THC dosing, but increases were subsequently observed two hours post-dose34. 
This time period is consistent with acute release and diffusion away, followed by up-

 regulation of synthesis to increase levels at 2 hours. Alternatively, factors that may 
contribute to the complex temporal course of dopaminergic effects include intricate changes 
in dopamine synthesis and metabolism. These comprise CB1R-mediated increases in 
tyrosine hydroxylase activity38 along with acute increases and longer-term decreases in 
monoamine-oxidase activity104, such that THC may exert differential effects on the time 
courses of dopamine synthesis and degradation. Equally, the partial agonist properties of 
THC on the CB1R only serve to obfuscate its dopaminergic effects since THC can both 
activate and block cannabinoid receptors, in a regionally specific and species-dependent 
manner based on the density and efficiency of populations of receptors and the 
concentrations of endogenous agonists19.
There are a number of challenges in assessing the long-term effects of exposure to THC. 
Firstly, it is plausible that discrepant findings may be attributable to the duration of THC 
treatment. Animal experiments are typically conducted following administration of THC for 
no longer than three weeks65,81,87 whilst human studies are conducted in participants who 
have taken cannabis over years (the duration of regular cannabis use is typically 3+ years76). 
Furthermore, it remains unclear to what degree homeostatic mechanisms are able to 
compensate for these alterations over time. Additionally, in humans there are a number of 
psychosocial and genetic risk factors that may predispose an individual to develop a 
cannabis use disorder. Given animal evidence of interactions between early life 
psychological deprivation and THC-induced effects on dopamine77, it is possible that the 
human data in cannabis-dependent participants is confounded by a range of environmental 
factors including parental loss, amongst other psychosocial factors105. Other environmental 
and physiological factors have been found to influence the dopaminergic effects of THC. Of 
particular potential human significance is sleep deprivation, which decreases dopamine 
turnover in response to THC106; and stress, which increases THC-induced dopamine 
synthesis107. Likewise, cannabis contains a multitude of other compounds, called 
phytocannabinoids, which likely exert differential and complex actions on the dopamine 
system which could have resulted in the varied response in human cannabis users vs. the 
more consistent animal data using THC only. Similarly, due to co-morbidity of addictions, it 
is particularly challenging for human imaging researchers to recruit participants with 
cannabis dependence who do not use other psychoactive compounds, including nicotine and 
alcohol, in more naturalistic studies.
Finally, whether THC is delivered in a contingent or non-contingent way is likely to be 
important given evidence that anticipation leads to dopamine release. In general, the animal 
studies include a variety of contingencies around the dosing of THC. In contrast, in the 
human acute studies THC was given to participants with a prior exposure to the drug but was 
not delivered in the habitual manner in which the drug is consumed, which may have 
reduced the degree of dopamine release.
Dopamine and the behavioural effects of THC
THC is associated with a number of behavioural effects which likely involve alterations in 
dopaminergic function. The first evidence of this came from early animal studies, which 
reported similarities between the behavioural effects of THC, including catalepsy and

 hypothermia108, and dopamine antagonists109. Likewise, THC antagonises the locomotor 
and hyperthermic effects of amphetamine, which causes dopamine release110. These 
seemingly paradoxical effects may be due to the high doses used in the early research 
together with the partial agonist effects of THC and/or non-specific receptor-independent 
effects.
THC promotes increased food intake in animals111 and humans112, colloquially referred to 
amongst users as “the munchies”. Since appetite is modulated by the dopamine system113, 
studies have investigated dopaminergic involvement in THC-induced feeding, finding that 
the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 attenuated THC-induced feeding at a dose 
that did not affect feeding on its own114. Recent research has identified CB1R mediated 
changes in hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons115 as potentially 
underlying this process via mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), which is involved in 
ghrelin-mediated dopaminergic function116.
Heavy cannabis use is associated with impaired educational and occupational outcomes117. 
Factors that may underlie this include cognitive impairment, including involving executive 
dysfunction118, working memory impairments119 and amotivation120, defined as reduced 
motivation for goal-directed behaviour121. These functions are susceptible to mesocortical 
dopaminergic manipulation122 including prefrontal D1 receptor blockade123, for example. 
Whilst a preclinical study reported that D2 receptor antagonism blocks THC-induced 
working memory deficits124, this was not replicated in humans125. Nonetheless, there is 
recent evidence that THC-induced working memory deficits are moderated by catechol-O-
methyltransferase (COMT), a key enzyme in the dopamine metabolic pathway126, which 
also modulates the effects of THC in adolescence on dopaminergic cells size87. Heavy 
chronic cannabis use produces apathetic behaviours in rhesus monkeys127 and a study in 
humans76 found that reduced dopamine synthesis capacity observed in heavy cannabis users 
was inversely related to amotivation. An overlapping feature of the amotivational syndrome 
associated with cannabis use disorders is negative emotionality128, such as reduced reward 
sensitivity and negative emotionality was also found to be inversely related to 
methylphenidate-induced dopamine ventral striatal dopamine release70.
The dopamine system is involved in risk for psychosis129. An early case report described 
increased striatal dopamine following cannabis intoxication associated with the exacerbation 
of psychotic symptoms in a patient with schizophrenia130. Furthermore, cannabis users with 
a diagnosis of schizophrenia and those at clinical high risk for schizophrenia displayed 
blunted striatal stress-induced dopamine release131. Although dopamine release was 
blunted in cannabis users with schizophrenia, it was nevertheless directly related to the 
induction of psychotic symptoms132. Supersensivity of post-synaptic D2 receptors65 could 
explain this apparent paradox, or it could be due to impaired endocannabinoid regulation of 
dopamine signal transduction. Supporting the latter explanation, patients with schizophrenia 
using high levels of cannabis show reduced anandamide levels133, and cannabidiol, a 
compound that elevates anandamide levels, has been shown to reduce psychotic 
symptoms134. Alternative post-synaptic mechanisms include CB1R-D2R 
heterodimerisation135 and downstream intracellular mechanisms including the neuregulin 1-

Outlook
There is now a substantial body of evidence in animals showing that THC exerts effects on 
the dopamine system. The key challenges for the field must be to understand the complexity 
of these effects, how these translate to humans and relate to the potential negative effects of 
the drug in humans (Box 2). Animal studies demonstrate that acute administration of THC 
causes region-specific increases in dopamine release and nerve activity and we must 
understand the functional significance of this. The available preclinical evidence suggests 
that chronic THC administration causes long-term changes on the dopamine system, but a 
general limitation of these models is that they do not reflect typical patterns of human use. 
Thus future studies should be of longer duration to reflect human use. This should also 
include co-administration with other drugs such as nicotine and alcohol that are commonly 
used with cannabis. Related to this is a need to understand how the dopaminergic effects of 
THC are moderated by the other phytocannabinoids. Human PET studies have demonstrated 
blunted dopamine synthesis and dopamine release in cannabis users relative to non-users, 
yet we still need to understand the precise mechanisms through which this occurs.
A key outstanding question remains “are the effects of THC on the dopamine system 
reversible, and, if not, at which point do these changes become irreversible?” Likewise, 
further molecular imaging studies in humans are needed to determine the dose-response and 
timing of the acute effects of THC on dopamine release, and to determine if there are 
regional differences in dopamine release, particularly between cortical and sub-cortical 
regions.
Ultimately, a key challenge in interpreting the animal and clinical work is the use of 
different techniques, some of which cannot be conducted in humans. Likewise, we must 
reach consensus on THC dose equivalence across species. It is therefore difficult to know 
what the implications of some preclinical work are for human research and how to back-
translate human findings into preclinical models. We must move out of silos and use 
translational techniques, such as PET and MR imaging approaches that can be conducted in 
humans and preclinical models that capture human use patterns in combination with 
traditional preclinical techniques. We must also understand how the psychoactive 
metabolites of THC, and the endocannabinoids modulate THC-induced changes in 
dopaminergic function.
Given changing patterns in cannabis use across the world, particularly in young people, and 
the consumption of cannabis with higher THC content, there is clearly a pressing need to 
understand how THC alters dopaminergic function. This is especially important given the 
emerging evidence that dopaminergic alterations are linked to a number of the adverse 
cognitive and behavioural consequences of THC, and the lack of current effective biological 
interventions for many of the psychiatric sequelae of cannabis use. Dopaminergic 
dysfunction may thus represent an area for future treatment targets.

 The evidence that gestational exposure to THC is associated with dysregulated dopamine 
synthesis in later life has major potential public health implications given the prevalence of 
cannabis use in women of child-bearing age and that the liberalisation of cannabis laws 
around the world may be associated with increased use of the drug amongst gravid and 
nursing mothers. However, questions about the developmental effects of THC remain. In 
particular, how long do the dopaminergic effects persist and what are their behavioural 
consequences? A related critical question is what are the effects of THC exposure during 
adolescence on the dopamine system?
In summary, the available evidence indicates that THC exposure produces complex, diverse 
and potentially long-term effects on the dopamine system including increased nerve firing 
and dopamine release in response to acute THC and dopaminergic blunting associated with 
long-term use. Future research should focus on probing the relationships between cannabis-
induced alterations in the dopamine system and behavioural effects in humans and animal 
models.

 Box 1: Glossary of methods used to assess dopaminergic activity after 
THC exposure
•
High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC): A technique to separate, 
identify and quantify a particular chemical from a mixture.
•
In vivo electrophysiology: A method of studying single neuron responses by 
using microelectrodes to record from cells, including in the living animal 
brain.
•
Microdialysis: A technique used for continuous measurement of 
neurochemicals and metabolites by inserting a probe into a specific area of 
brain.
•
Positron Emission Tomography (PET): An imaging technique that uses a 
positron-emitting radiotracer that binds to specific proteins including 
receptors, enzymes and transporters. The gamma rays produced by the 
radionuclide allow quantification of proteins in living tissue non-invasively 
with very high chemical specificity.
•
Single photon emission (computed) tomography (SPECT): An imaging 
technique similar to positron emission tomography, but with lower spatial 
resolution.
•
Synaptosome: A homogenized mixture of isolated synaptic terminals.

 Box 2: Strategy for future work.
Preclinical and Clinical Research
•
Determine the relationships between cannabis-induced alterations in the 
dopamine system and behavioural phenomena in humans and animal models.
•
Use translational techniques that can be applied in human and animal studies 
alike and employ study designs that better reflect patterns of human use, 
including modelling contingency in acute THC challenge studies
•
Consensus needed on dose equivalence across species.
•
Determine if THC-induced dopaminergic changes during key developmental 
phases persists into later life and if this is linked to behavioural changes
•
Investigate how gene variants that modulate the endocannabinoid and 
dopamine systems influence the sensitivity to the rewarding effects of THC 
and the vulnerability to addiction, amotivation and psychosis following 
chronic exposures
•
Investigate the effects of sex in THC response. This will be useful to 
understand the different susceptibility to cannabis effects that have been 
reported between males and females74.
Preclinical Research
•
Determine the effects of long-term THC exposures on the dopamine system 
alongside co-administration with nicotine to reflect typical patterns of human 
use.
•
Determine the mechanisms underlying the complex dose-response effects of 
THC on dopaminergic function.
•
Elucidate the mechanisms for regional differences in dopaminergic effects 
and the functional significance of this on behaviour.
•
Determine if the long-term effects of THC are reversible with abstinence.
Clinical Research
•
Determine if the blunted dopamine release and synthesis seen in chronic users 
is a pre-existing vulnerability factor or a direct result of repeated THC 
exposure.
•
Determine the dopaminergic changes over the course of repeated THC 
exposures and dose-response effects.
•
Consensus needed in the human literature on how to report previous exposure 
to cannabis use.
•
Determine if there are regional differences in dopamine release to THC in 
humans.

 Fig. 1. THC binds to CB1 receptors on glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons disrupting 
normal endocannabinoid retrograde signalling from dopaminergic neurons137.
Endocannabinoids (eCBs) influence ventral tegmental area (VTA) synaptic signalling. 2-
Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) is synthesised by diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL) in 
dopaminergic VTA neurons and, once released, retroactively acts on endocannabinoid type 1 
receptors (CB1Rs) on nearby glutamatergic and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic 
terminals. CB1Rs mediate robust inhibition of GABA inputs onto VTA dopamine cells29, 
termed retrograde suppression of inhibition. CB1Rs are also localized on glutamatergic 
terminals synapsing on VTA dopamine neurons30 where eCBs mediate retrograde

 suppression of excitation. Thus, eCBs fine-tune the activity of the mesolimbic dopamine 
projections through modulating both excitatory and inhibitory signalling. THC disrupts this 
finely tuned system.

 Fig. 3. Cannabis use in humans is associated with reduced dopamine in the striatum. PET studies 
have shown lower striatal dopamine synthesis and release capacity in cannabis users.
Lower dopamine synthesis capacity in the dorsal striatum is directly associated with reduced 
motivational levels76 and reduced dopamine release in the ventral striatum is directly 
associated with negative emotion levels and addiction severity70
