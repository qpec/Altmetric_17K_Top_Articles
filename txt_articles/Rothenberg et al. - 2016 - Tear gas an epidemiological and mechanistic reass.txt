Deployments of tear gas and pepper spray have rapidly increased worldwide. Large amounts of tear gas have been
used in densely populated cities, including Cairo, Istanbul, Rio de Janeiro, Manama (Bahrain), and Hong Kong.
In the United States, tear gas was used extensively during recent riots in Ferguson, Missouri. Whereas tear gas
deployment systems have rapidly improved—with aerial drone systems tested and requested by law enforcement—
epidemiological and mechanistic research have lagged behind and have received little attention. Case studies and
recent epidemiological studies revealed that tear gas agents can cause lung, cutaneous, and ocular injuries, with
individuals affected by chronic morbidities at high risk for complications. Mechanistic studies identified the ion
channels TRPV1 and TRPA1 as targets of capsaicin in pepper spray, and of the tear gas agents chloroacetophenone,
CS, and CR. TRPV1 and TRPA1 localize to pain-sensing peripheral sensory neurons and have been linked to acute
and chronic pain, cough, asthma, lung injury, dermatitis, itch, and neurodegeneration. In animal models, transient
receptor potential inhibitors show promising effects as potential countermeasures against tear gas injuries. On the
basis of the available data, a reassessment of the health risks of tear gas exposures in the civilian population is advised,
and development of new countermeasures is proposed.

Tear gas agents for riot control
Over the past several decades, tear gas has been
used as a common riot-control agent (RCA) by law
enforcement to quell protests, riots, and civil unrest.
Tear gas use has dramatically increased in recent
years, with very large amounts released in popula-
tion centers in Turkey,1 the United States,2 Hong
Kong,3 Greece,4 Brazil,5 Egypt, and Bahrain.6,7
Tear gas is generally perceived to be a sublethal
incapacitant.8 A 2003 analysis of several tear gases
and incapacitants concluded that, on the basis of
available toxicological evidence, commonly used
tear gases have a large safety margin for life-
threatening or irreversible toxic effects.9 Another
medical review published in 2013 concluded that, in
the majority of exposures, significant clinical effects
are not anticipated.10 However, there are debates
surrounding the acceptability of tear gas use for
riot-control purposes, especially in the background
of the recent massive use. Many believe the risks of
tear gas exposure are understated and that perceived
risks are based on insufficient human epidemiolog-
ical and mechanistic data.
The major RCAs used since World War II include
o-chlorobenzylidene malononitrile (CS), oleoresin
capsicum (OC, pepper spray), dibenz [b,f]-1,4-
oxazepine (CR), and 1-chloroacetophenone (CN)11
(Fig. 1). The most commonly used RCA until the
1950s was CN, but a search for an alternative to CN
was initiated in response to dissatisfaction with the
potency and stability of the compound.12 CS was
discovered by two American scientists in 192813 but
wasonlydevelopedforuseasanRCAdecadeslater.14

less toxic than CN at that time—was adopted as the
standard RCA of the U.S. Army in 1959.12,15 In the
following decades, CS became the most common
RCA, and it is now used widely.16 CS, CN, and CR
tear gas agents are electrophilic agents, and their
structures are presented in Figure 1.
OC is a mixture of several compounds extracted
from chili peppers, with capsaicin as the major
active ingredient.14 Pepper spray was developed as
an animal repellent in the 1960s, but law enforce-
ment agencies in the United States began using the
compound for personal protection in the 1980s and
1990s.11 The rise in popularity of OC was similar
to the rise in popularity of CS: OC was adopted
as a less dangerous alternative to Mace, an aerosol
self-defense spray whose primary component was
CN.11 CS and OC are now almost exclusively used
as the RCAs of choice. The use of tear gas agents
in warfare between military forces is banned under
the 1993 International Chemical Weapons Conven-
tion, Geneva (Organisation for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons), likely due to fear of escala-
tion of chemical warfare. Some countries, including
the United States, issued executive orders permit-
ting the use of tear gas by military forces against
rioting civilians and nonmilitary combatants and
for troop extraction.17 The domestic use of tear gas
agents is not covered by the Geneva Convention.17
Lack of epidemiological and mechanistic data on
the spectrum of health effects of tear gas hinders the
development of treatment plans and countermea-
sures and the medical understanding of long-term
effects. In this review, we summarize the existing
epidemiological data on the health effects and bio-
logical mechanistic effects of tear gas agents and
make recommendations to bridge the paucity of
knowledge in this area.
Deployment technologies
Though commonly referred to as “tear gas,” the
active compounds are not actually gases but solids.
RCAs are deployed in many different ways, as per-
sonal defense sprays or from grenades or canisters.12
Sprays use a liquid formulation that is released from
apressurizeddispenser,whilegrenadesandcanisters
use a powdered form blended with a pyrotechnic
mixture that can be aerosolized for dispersion as
a smoke or fog.12 A common solvent for sprays
is methyl isobutyl ketone (hexone), which is also
considered hazardous.18,19 CS tear gas agent is typi-
cally aerosolized as 3- to 10-�m microencapsulated
microparticles in aerosols. The typical pyrotechnic
composition for dissemination of CS riot control
agent consists of 45% CS agent, 30% potassium
chlorate,14%epoxyresin,7%maleicanhydride,3%
methyl nadic anhydride, and 0.03% mixed residual
balance.20 Although the intrinsic toxicities of these
ingredients in the pyrotechnic composition were
not studied in detail, their safety data sheets show
significant toxicities. These pyrotechnic devices
can be thrown by hand or fired from launchers,
engaging targets up to 400 m away and penetrating
window glass,12 with dispersion area ranges from
60 to 300 m2.21 Aircraft- and vehicle-mounted dis-
persers can be used for RCA deployment, and aerial
drone–based RCA deployment systems have been
tested and requested by several law enforcement
agencies, with widespread adoption likely once the
technology has sufficiently advanced.12
Pepper spray (OC) is typically dispersed from a
handheld canister.21 However, it is also available
in a number of different types of grenades and
projectiles.22 CN can be dissolved in a solvent, used
in irritant sprays like Mace, or deployed from ther-
mal grenades.11
Health effects of tear gas exposures
Exposure to tear gas agents produces a wide
spectrum of health effects, including acute and
chronic effects. Studies have demonstrated specific
receptor-mediated mechanisms of action of tear gas
agents.23,24 Whereas these specific receptors con-
tribute to their acute painful and irritant effects,
the electrophilic reactivity of the agents, together
with the toxicities of solvents and pyrotechnic

reaction products, engages multiple toxicological
mechanisms that remain to be studied.
Immediate exposure effects
CS and OC produce similar symptoms. Acute CS
exposure at concentrations generally used by law
enforcement for riot-control purposes results in
instantaneous irritation to the eyes, nose, mouth,
skin, and respiratory tract.9 Dermal effects include
itching, stinging, and redness, with potential
blistering and allergic contact dermatitis.25 Ocular
exposure can result in lacrimation, blepharospasm,
itching, and burning sensation.26 When inhaled,
CS often leads to coughing, choking, salivation, and
chest tightness.11 OC exposure causes pain and
tingling in the respiratory tract, accompanied by
coughing.11 SignsandsymptomsofOCcontactwith
eyes include lacrimation, inflammation of the con-
junctiva, blepharospasm, redness, pain, burning,
and edema.14 Some evidence indicates that OC
may also temporarily inhibit the blink reflex and
limit responsiveness to mechanical and chemical
stimuli to the eye.14 Like CS, dermal effects of OC
can include pain, tingling, redness, swelling, and
blistering.14 The effects of CN are similar to those
of CS and OC,27 but are significantly more severe
and potentially life threatening. CN is a more toxic
lacrimator than CS and is more likely to cause
serious injury to the skin.11
Respiratory effects
Much of the research surrounding the effects of tear
gas exposure was derived from laboratory animal
research or from small studies of previously healthy
individuals in controlled conditions, and several
believe this level of research is inadequate for safety
assessment.17,28 For example, one study conclud-
ing that tear gas exposure was not associated with
increasedairwayresistancewasconductedonasam-
ple of only seven healthy military volunteers, and
those with a history of chronic respiratory illness
were excluded.16 Tear gas use in riots or instances
of large-scale civil disorder could result in extended,
repeated, or highly concentrated exposures, which
pose a greater threat to respiratory health.14,29 High
concentrations of CS or OC can cause severe respi-
ratory symptoms, such as reactive airways dysfunc-
tion syndrome, in an individual exposed to both
CS and OC and hemoptysis.30–32 Capsaicin infiltra-
tion of the lower respiratory tract can induce pul-
monary edema, apnea, and respiratory arrest.11 Sur-
veys performed after recent massive-scale tear gas
deployments in Turkey reported persistent cough,
chest pain, sputum production, hemoptysis, breath-
ing difficulties, and nasal discharge, sometimes last-
ing for weeks after exposure.28 Lung function tests
observed restriction and medium and small airway
obstruction that was more severe in women.22 Res-
piratoryeffectswerealsoobservedinresidentsofthe
areas where tear gas was deployed, suggesting that
tear gas agents represent a persistent environmental
health hazard.29
Another Turkish study with 93 males frequently
exposedtoteargasand55unexposedsubjectsfound
that tear gas–exposed subjects were at greater risk
for chronic bronchitis.33 A study of 34 young adults
exposed to CS in a confined space during a con-
frontation with the police reported no long-term
sequelae.34
CS-induced respiratory illness during military
training
Unexpectedrespiratory riskslinkedtoteargasexpo-
sures were discovered in epidemiological studies by
the U.S. Army, analyzing health effects in more than
6000 army recruits exposed to CS in chambers dur-
ing gas mask–confidence training. This relatively
young and healthy population developed a high
risk of presenting with acute respiratory illness in
the time after CS exposure, with increasing risk at
higher exposure concentrations.35,36 Exposure lev-
els considered for many years safe and necessary for
training were determined to far exceed the National
Institute for Occupational and Safety and Health
and Occupational Safety and Health Administra-
tion safety levels.37 These findings led to immedi-
ate measures limiting exposure concentrations and
times, improving decontamination procedures, and
imposing frequent hygiene and health monitoring.
Measures of respiratory illness included throat pain,
cough, bronchitis, nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, and
other indications. CS exposures were also asso-
ciated with an increase in respiratory infections,
including influenza. Follow-up studies demon-
strated that lowering CS exposures during training
effectively reduced the risk for respiratory illness.38
Whether these lower concentrations are also safe
for diverse civilian populations remains unclear.
Follow-up epidemiological studies in military pop-
ulations would represent a unique opportunity to

identify potential long-term health effects of tear gas
exposures.
Ocular effects
Tear gas deployed at close range can cause severe
ocular injuries, including corneal stromal edema,
conjunctival tearing, and deep vascularization of
the eye.39 Other ocular complications include vit-
reous hemorrhage, traumatic optic neuropathy,
symblepharon, pseudopterygium, infective kerati-
tis, trophic keratopathy, glaucoma, and cataracts.39
One report described four subjects who developed
corneal erosion following exposure to pepper spray,
indicating that OC or a solvent in the spray may
cause nerve damage.40
Skin burns and dermatitis
Physicians examining CS-exposed patients often
report skin burns, especially when large quantities
are used, as in a case involving a riot at a Viet-
namese refugee detention center in Hong Kong.30,32
Multiple cases of unusually severe skin reactions
in response to CS exposure have been reported,
including severe facial erythema and swelling that
obscured vision.41 Physicians from the Department
of Dermatology at San Francisco General Hospital
observed severe CS-induced erythematous dermati-
tis of the face, neck, and hands.42 Cases of allergic
contact sensitization were reported with erythema-
tous patches and multiple vesicular eruptions on
the skin following heavy exposure to CS.43 Ninety
percent of workers in a plant manufacturing a CS
agent reported a history of dermatitis on the arms
and neck, with 7% showing positive patch-test reac-
tions to CS, suggesting that CS may act as a contact
sensitizer.44
Cardiovascular and gastrointestinal effects
Irritation of the gastrointestinal tract due to
ingestion of compounds like CS may cause nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, and hematemesis.14,32 Various
cardiovascular effects, including tachycardia and
transient hypertension, have been observed in some
individuals, likely initiated by sensory–autonomic
reflexes or anxiety, pain, or psychological distress.45
Severe injuries and deaths
There have been numerous case reports of injuries
and fatalities associated with exposure to high con-
centrationsofteargasorexposureinenclosedspaces
or for extended periods of time. Deaths and respi-
ratory tract injuries were reported after release of
tear gas in prisons.46–48 CS and OC are increas-
ingly used in prison systems, often in enclosed
and poorly ventilated spaces. Deaths of inmates
with preexisting respiratory conditions have been
linked to multiple CS and OC exposures and lack
of decontamination.49 Other studies documented
cases of death within 1 h of exposure to OC, though
a direct causal link has not yet been established.14
Severe injuries and deaths have been reported dur-
ing the massive-scale deployments of tear gas muni-
tions in Egypt, Turkey, Bahrain, and Brazil. These
wereoftencausedbydirectorcloseimpactofteargas
munitions causing severe head and eye injuries and
burns.50,51 A well-documented case is the death of
37 Egyptian inmates in a prisoner van into which
tear gas munitions were fired.52 Circumstantial
reports suggest a correlation between CS exposure
and miscarriage.16,51,53
Lack of epidemiological research in tear
gas–exposed civilian populations and
high-risk groups
There is a significant amount of research examin-
ing the acute effects of RCA exposure among small
samples of healthy individuals in controlled condi-
tions,butlittleinformationhasbeengatheredonthe
consequences of exposure in the field. A review on
exposure to the CS tear gas agent attempted to com-
pile case reports on the basis of PubMed and Scopus
literature searches.54 The real-world conditions in
which tear gas is used make it difficult to discrim-
inate between the effects of different RCAs and to
conduct effective epidemiological investigations.16
It is often not possible to ascertain the exposure
concentration and duration among exposed indi-
viduals, and weather or terrain factors can further
complicate analysis. Because of the difficulties asso-
ciated with conducting epidemiological investiga-
tions of RCA effects and the lack of public support
for these studies, few epidemiological studies have
been published, and the reliability of the results is
often deficient. The situation is further complicated
by the fact that research conducted by various mil-
itary organizations is often classified,55 and organi-
zations may be denied access to health information
during instances of civil unrest.56
While prolonged exposure can lead to increased
severity of symptoms, conclusions from past
research indicated that most effects should resolve
within minutes of removal from exposure. However,

Rothenberg et al.
evidence supporting this conclusion came from
significantly limited studies. For example, one
oft-cited study deemed CS tear gas safe on the basis
of outcomes of controlled exposures of 35 healthy
male volunteers, without considering the effects on
children, women, the elderly, or subjects affected
by preexisting conditions.26 Deficiencies in the
currently available research have impeded under-
standing of all of the risks potentially associated
with chemical RCAs. The effects of RCA exposure
among sensitive populations and among those
with underlying health conditions are one such
area where the level of risk is unclear. Individuals
suffering from asthma or reactive airways disease
could be at greater risk for more serious adverse
effects from tear gas exposure, as chemical RCAs
cause significant respiratory symptoms, which
could plausibly be exacerbated in the presence of
underlying respiratory illness. Current research on
the issue, however, remains equivocal on the topic.
A study of CS exposure in one group found no
increase in airway resistance after exposure, but the
study subjects only included healthy volunteers, and
those with a history of asthma were excluded from
the study.16 A report of CS exposure in a nightclub
indicated that patients with asthma experienced
no greater sensitivity to the RCA,57 and similar
results were published in the report of an inquiry
into a CS exposure in Londonderry in 1969.58
However, according to a study of RCA exposure
in South Korea, physicians reported that patients
with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease experienced deterioration of lung function
following tear gas exposure—some to a serious
degree necessitating a longer stay at the hospital.16
Other populations besides those with underlying
respiratory conditions may also be at a greater sus-
ceptibility to harm from RCAs. The British Depart-
ment of Health and other sources reported that
individualswithhypertensionorcardiovasculardis-
ease, as well as those taking neuroleptic medica-
tions, may be more susceptible to CS, calling for
more research to be done in these populations.11,59
In one case study, a 40-year-old male was diagnosed
with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) following
exposure to pepper spray, indicating that OC could
potentially be a triggering factor.60 There is a strong
relationship between inhalation of particulate mat-
ter and AMI.61 While the acute pain and cardiores-
piratory distress following exposure can contribute
to triggering AMI, the consequences of inhalation
of microencapsulated and precipitated particles, oil
droplets, and particles generated during combus-
tion from tear gas sprays or munitions need to be
further investigated.
Biological targets and mechanisms
TRPV1: the target of capsaicin in pepper
spray
The active noxious agent in pepper spray is cap-
saicin, purified and enriched from pungent chili
peppers. The molecular target of capsaicin, TRPV1,
was discovered in 1997.62 TRPV1 is a transient
receptor potential (TRP) ion channel expressed in
nociceptors, the pain-sensing peripheral sensory
nerves of the trigeminal, vagal, and dorsal root gan-
glia (DRG). Nociceptor nerve endings are present
in all organs and the body surface, including the
skin, cornea, conjunctiva, and the mucous mem-
branes of the upper and lower airways and lung.
TRPV1 is a nonselective cation channel that, when
activated by capsaicin, promotes neuronal depolar-
ization. TRPV1 is also activated when nerve endings
are exposed to noxious heat, acting as a thermal
warning sensor for imminent tissue damage. Tissue
acidification or acid exposures lead to sensitiza-
tion or activation of TRPV1. TRPV1 is sensitized
through signaling from a range of G protein–
coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases
activated during injury and inflammation. These
include the bradykinin receptor, prostaglandin
receptors, nerve growth factor receptors, and
cytokine and chemokine receptors.
TRPA1: the reactive irritant receptor mediating
the acute effects of tear gas agents
The tear gas agents CS, CN, and CR are struc-
turally dissimilar, suggesting they might bind to
different targets (Fig. 1). However, a single target,
TRPA1, was identified as mediating the acute nox-
ious effects of these agents and of many similarly
acting chemical exposures.24,63 TRPA1 is also a TRP
ion channel and, similar to TRPV1, is expressed in
nociceptors. Pain neurobiological studies initially
revealedthatTRPA1isthetargetofmustardoil(allyl
isothiocyanate), the pain-inducing and lachryma-
tory product in mustard, wasabi, and horseradish.64
Together with capsaicin, mustard oil was used as an
important chemical tool to characterize the func-
tion of nociceptor subtypes in pain transduction.

 Rothenberg et al.
Tear gas: epidemiology and mechanisms
Mustard oil is an electrophile, and TRPA1 was also
foundtoberesponsivetosimilarnaturallyoccurring
isothiocyanates and related compounds in onions
and garlic.64,65 Isocyanates, such as mustard oil, are
electrophiles thought to act as defensive agents of
the plants against herbivores. Mustard oil is not
to be mistaken with sulfur mustard and nitrogen
mustard, the blistering agents belonging to a differ-
ent class of chemical warfare agents in mustard gas.
While these agents share a similar odor with mus-
tard oil, mustard gas exposure is not immediately
painful and has delayed effects.
Intriguingly, pretreatment of animals with cap-
saicin desensitized them to perceiving pain from
mustard oil, suggesting that receptors for these
agents may be expressed in the same nerve fibers,
where they desensitize each other. Indeed, TRPV1
and TRPA1 were found to be expressed in the
same population of nociceptors. Toxicological stud-
ies have shown that capsaicin pretreatment desensi-
tizes neuronal responses to a wide range of chemical
sensory irritants targeting nociceptors. One exam-
ple is the volatile electrophile acrolein, an unsat-
urated aldehyde and the major airborne irritant
in smoke from fires and combusted tobacco and
in diesel exhaust.66 Acrolein was used briefly as
an irritant gas in warfare in World War I. Cap-
saicin pretreatment was shown to render mouse
nasal trigeminal neurons unresponsive to airborne
acrolein.66 Studies in heterologous expression sys-
tems revealed that both rodent and human TRPA1
channels were activated by acrolein.23 Similar effects
were seen with croton aldehyde, another tobacco
smoke aldehyde, and even saturated aldehydes, such
as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde.
The discovery of TRPA1 as an electrophilic irri-
tant receptor inspired additional studies that in
2008 identified TRPA1 as the principal target of
the tear gas agents CN, CS, and CR, in vitro and
in vivo.24,63 These three agents are among the most
potentTRPA1agonistsknown,withCSandCRacti-
vating human TRPA1 channels in the low nanomo-
lar or subnanomolar range, more than 10,000-fold
more potent than mustard oil and other natural
TRPA1 agonists. Modified electrophilic CR-based
chemicals were even more potent than the parent
compound.67 Mice with a targeted deletion in Trpa1
displayed no or only minimal acute pain behavior
when exposed to CN or CS, confirming the essen-
tial role of TRPA1 in their sensory detection.24 In
human studies, the potency of tear gas agent deriva-
tives toward TRPA1 showed clear correlation with
their perceived irritancy, suggesting that TRPA1 also
contributes to tear gas sensing in humans.68
TRPA1 is activated by a large variety of struc-
turally unrelated irritant chemicals.69 This sensitiv-
ity to multiple chemicals cannot be explained by a
traditionalpharmacologicalligand–receptormodel.
Biochemical studies revealed a reactivity-based acti-
vation mechanism of TRPA1, in which electrophilic
and oxidizing activators modify cysteine residues in
the N-terminal domain of TRPA1, resulting in cova-
lent modification leading to channel activation.70
Thus, TRPA1 can be considered a peripheral
neuronal reactivity detector, signaling the danger
of imminent injury by electrophilic or oxidant
exposures.
Health effects related to TRP channel
activation
The discovery of TRP ion channels as the primary
sensory detectors for environmental, chemical, and
physical stimuli in peripheral sensory neurons was
a watershed in sensory neurobiology and pharma-
cology. While initial studies focused on the roles of
TRPV1 and TRPA1 in pain, more recent discoveries
revealed that these ion channels play fundamental
roles in reflex responses in the respiratory, cardio-
vascular, digestive, and other organ systems and in
acute and chronic inflammatory and degenerative
conditions. These pathological mechanisms need to
be taken into consideration when reassessing the
acute and chronic health effects of tear gas expo-
sures, especially in exposed individuals affected by
chronic health conditions within a diverse civilian
population.
Pain
Tear gas and pepper spray exposures cause imme-
diate and severe pain leading to incapacitation.
Ocular and nasal pain are sensed almost imme-
diately and are initiated by activation of trigemi-
nal nerve endings in the cornea and nasal passages
that are highly sensitive to chemical exposures. Since
TRPV1 and TRPA1 were identified as major pain-
initiatingreceptors,thepharmaceuticalindustryhas
developed a wide range of inhibitors for develop-
ment as analgesics. Analgesic action was demon-
strated in animal models of acute and inflammatory
pain. In clinical trials, TRPV1 inhibitors alleviated

heat-induced pain, with moderate effects toward
other pain modalities. The development of TRPA1
inhibitors began later, with clinical trials ongoing at
this time.
Cough and airway obstruction
Cough is elicited when a chemical irritant activates
vagal sensory nerve endings in the larynx. Vagal
sensory nerves express higher levels of TRPV1 and
TRPA1 than the trigeminal ganglia and DRG. Cap-
saicin is often used as a cough stimulus in clini-
cal settings, and many airborne TRPA1 agonists are
cough triggers. Tear gas and pepper spray exposures
trigger cough directly but also cause profuse secre-
tions within the airways due to sensory–autonomic
reflexes. Secretions further aggravate cough and
contribute to incapacitation by obstructing nor-
mal breathing and eliciting the fear of suffocation.
Recent studies have implicated TRPA1 sensitization
and heightened activity in chronic cough and cough
hypersensitivity.71
Asthma
Recent studies in animal models of allergen-induced
asthma have shown that TRPA1 plays a critical
role in the initiation and maintenance of asthmatic
inflammation, airway hyperreactivity, and smooth
musclecontraction.72,73 Humangeneticstudieshave
associated polymorphisms in TRPA1 with reduced
control of asthma.74 Irritant-induced asthma, man-
ifesting as airway hyperreactivity following irritant
inhalation, was also shown to depend on TRPA1.75
With an asthma prevalence of 8.4% in the U.S. pop-
ulation and similar levels around the world, there is
a high chance of exposure to tear gas and the devel-
opment of complications in asthmatics. Indeed, the
most severe complications reported after tear gas
deployment involve asthma attacks.34
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder and
lung injury
TRPA1 is activated by many of the principal irritants
in tobacco smoke, including acrolein, crotonalde-
hyde, and smoke particulates.23,74 In chronic smok-
ers, inhalation of these irritants contributes to the
etiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disor-
der. TRPA1 has also been implicated in ventilator-
induced lung injury, in which mechanical stress
and oxygen activate sensory neurons that may con-
tribute to the observed inflammatory response.
Activation of TRPA1 in the lung was shown to
trigger the release of proinflammatory neuropep-
tides, such as CGRP, substance P, and neurokinin
A.24 While additional research is needed to delin-
eate the role of TRPA1 in lung injury, these find-
ings suggest that TRPA1 activation may aggravate
preexisting pulmonary inflammation, injury, and
remodeling processes in smokers and other affected
individuals.
Cardiac arrhythmia
Irritant exposures have been linked to cardio-
vascular stress and sensory–autonomic dysregu-
lation of cardiovascular function. Studies in rats
prone to arrhythmia have shown that respiratory
exposures to diesel exhaust or acrolein strongly
increase the risk of arrhythmia through sympathetic
activation.76,77 Rats treated with a TRPA1 inhibitor
were resistant to exposure-induced arrhythmias,
suggesting that TRPA1 is a key chemical detec-
tor triggering circuits that alter cardiovascular
control.76,77 Tear gas exposures may have similar
effects in humans, suggesting that exposed individ-
uals with preexisting cardiovascular conditions and
arrhythmias may be at increased risk of developing
cardiovascular complications.
Dermatitis and itch
TRPA1 agonists, such as mustard oil, are known
to cause skin inflammation and edema that are
diminished in TRPA1-deficient mice. TRPA1 plays
a key role in the neuronal control of skin inflam-
mation and in the neuronal transduction of itch
signals mediated by a specialized subpopulation of
sensory neurons.78 TRPA1 is coupled to pruritogen
receptors and is essential for full development of
inflammation and itch in hapten-induced contact
dermatitis.78 Tear gas exposures of the skin cause
pain, skin edema, and inflammation with itching.
Tear gas agents can likely act as haptens them-
selves, and skin hypersensitivity reactions to tear gas
agents, including allergic contact dermatitis, have
been reported.34,43
Thus, atopic and exposed individuals affected by
contact dermatitis may be at risk of developing
adverse skin reactions. The appearance of clinical
cutaneous symptoms varies widely from a few min-
utes to several weeks. A summary of dermal clini-
cal symptoms following CS tear gas exposure and
latency periods has been published.54

Tear gas: epidemiology and mechanisms
Peripheral nerve damage
The analgesic properties of TRPA1 inhibitors are
currently being tested in clinical trials in patients
affected by diabetic neuropathy, a painful neurode-
generative condition. TRPA1 plays a key role in the
peripheral neuronal hypersensitivity to metabolic
stress in diabetic animal models.79 Chronic TRPA1
activity leads to nerve calcium overload and exci-
totoxicity, resulting in chronic pain signaling and
peripheral neurodegeneration, leading to loss of
sensation or altered sensations. Other chemically
induced neurodegenerative conditions were also
linked to TRPA1, including chemotherapy-induced
neuropathies.80 With more than 9% of the U.S.
population affected by diabetes and diabetes rates
approaching similar levels in other countries, this
population needs to be considered at risk during
tear gas exposures. Ligands of TRPV1 and TRPA1,
when applied topically, are known to cause extensive
desensitization and remodeling of cutaneous nerve
endings. With tear gas agents being so highly potent,
it is likely that similar effects occur. While desensi-
tized nerve endings can recover and normal sensory
capacity can be reestablished, high-level exposures
and local contamination may cause long-term dam-
age to the underlying sensory innervation.
TRP channel inhibitors as
countermeasures against tear gas effects
At this time, no mechanism-based countermea-
sures are available to alleviate the noxious effects of
tear gas and pepper spray exposures. Countermea-
sures mostly involve decontamination strategies,
including rinsing with water and buffered solutions,
discarding contaminated clothing, and medical
supportive treatment.
Highly potent and selective TRPV1 inhibitors
have been developed and tested in animal stud-
ies and in clinical trials with proven efficacies for
capsaicin-induced and thermally induced pain.81
It remains unclear whether these inhibitors will
be developed further toward U.S. Food and Drug
Administration approval for pain indications and
will be considered for testing as countermeasures
against pepper spray exposures.
A TRPA1 inhibitor was efficacious for prevention
of tear gas agent (CN and CS) exposure–induced
ocular pain in mice.24 Since anti-inflammatory and
analgesic effects have been observed for TRPA1
inhibitors in multiple models of chemical injury
and inflammation, it is highly likely that TRPA1
inhibitors will alleviate at least some of the tear
gas–induced effects. There remains concern about
the specificity and poor solubility of the tool com-
pounds available for TRPA1 inhibition. The con-
clusion of clinical trials using TRPA1 inhibitors in
diabetic neuropathic patients is eagerly awaited with
thehopethatmoreadvancedinhibitorswillbemade
available for testing in other conditions, including
irritant and tear gas agent exposures.
Other targets of tear gas agents
Owing to their electrophilic properties, tear gas
agents likely react with many other biomolecules
in the eyes, respiratory tract, and skin. The nature
of these targets is largely unknown. Similar to
acrolein and related electrophiles, tear gas agents
may damage and deplete biological redox systems
in the lining fluids of epithelia and within cells
and mitochondria, modify structural proteins
and nucleic acids, and inactivate enzymes. There
has been minimal research on endocrine effects,
immunologic
consequences,
and
histological
changes from CS exposure, but some animal studies
indicate that potential effects may occur. Studies in
rats injected with CS found histological changes in
the adrenal gland and the thyroid, though it is not
clear whether dermal or inhalational exposure to
CS in humans would result in a similar response.82
Another study of CS exposure in mice reported
suppression of the humoral immune response and
elevated corticosteroid levels.83 The mutagenicity
and potential carcinogenic effects of RCAs are also
not well understood, with research clearly lacking.
Some laboratory studies indicate that CS is not
mutagenic84 or is weakly mutagenic,85 but the
results of carcinogenicity studies have not been
confirmed,86 andmuchoftheresearchhasbeenlim-
itedtolaboratorystudiesratherthanhumanstudies.
The mutagenicity of capsaicinoids has been tested
extensively, but the results have been conflicting.14
Dispersal of RCAs involving pyrotechnic mixtures
can produce thermal degradation by-products that
could potentially be dangerous to human health.87
Discussion and recommendations
The decision by law enforcement to use tear gas dur-
ing civil disorder is understandable, as CN, CS, and
OC are effective RCAs and reduce the risk of injury
to law enforcement personnel and demonstrators

 Tear gas: epidemiology and mechanisms
Rothenberg et al.
when used instead of physical force.10,88 However,
the massive increase in tear gas deployments world-
wide,accompaniedbyadvancesinformulationsand
deployment technologies and the often-observed
absence or disregard of evidence-based deployment
rules and operating procedures, is of great concern.
Epidemiological research on tear gas health effects
is clearly deficient and has received little public
support. Evidence from the limited epidemiologi-
cal studies available and from case studies demon-
stratesthatteargasagentshavethepotentialtocause
serious harm and present specific threats to vulner-
able populations, including children, women, and
individuals affected by respiratory, cutaneous, and
cardiovascular morbidities. While breakthroughs in
mechanistic basic science have been made, discover-
ing TRPV1 and TRPA1 as agent receptors, evidence
that these targets are involved in multiple mor-
bidities has not been taken into consideration for
reassessment of tear gas use, and mechanism-based
countermeasures development has not progressed.
Based on these deficiencies, we make the follow-
ing recommendations:
(1) The toxicological effects of tear gas agents
should be reassessed using state-of-the-art
toxicological techniques utilizing toxicology
in the 21st century (Tox21) collaboration
approaches (https://www.epa.gov/chemical-
research/toxicology-testing-21st-century-
tox21) and animal models of respiratory,
cutaneous, and cardiovascular morbidities,
taking into account age and sex differences.
(2) Epidemiological research networks should
be established to develop standardized ques-
tionnaires;
collect
medical
data,
tissue,
and fluid samples from exposed patients;
curate biorepositories; perform environ-
mental analysis; and conduct follow-up
investigations. Mandatory cooperation of
law enforcement with this network before,
during, and after deployment needs to be
specified in standard operating procedures.
(3) Epidemiological investigation of tear gas–
exposed military populations should be
extended to identify potential long-term
effects.
(4) Efficient countermeasures need to be devel-
oped for treatment of individuals exposed
to high levels of tear gas agents. Counter-
measures should include new decontamina-
tion strategies based on the chemical prop-
erties of tear gas agents, their solvents, and
pyrotechnic products and novel pharmaco-
logical inhibitors of the TRP ion channels
TRPV1 and TRPA1, currently in clinical tri-
als for pain indications.
(5) Efforts must be made to make tear gas muni-
tions traceable to document use volume,
deployment locations, and numbers.
(6) Efficient export and world trade controls
must be enacted to prevent procurement
and manufacture of RCAs by state actors
and organizations that repeatedly deploy tear
gas agents resulting in deaths, mass injuries,
and widespread contamination and prohibit
medical care and act against medical person-
nel treating the exposed.
