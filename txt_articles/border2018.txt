ABSTRACT
Background and aims
Adolescents with conduct and substance use problems are at increased risk for premature
mortality, but the extent to which these risk factors reflect family- or individual-level differences and account for shared
or unique variance is unknown. This study examined common and independent contributions to mortality hazard in
adolescents ascertained for conduct disorder (CD) and substance use disorder (SUD), their siblings and community
controls, hypothesizing that individual differences in CD and SUD severity would explain unique variation in mortality risk
beyond that due to clinical/control status and demographic factors. Design
Mortality analysis in a prospective study
(Genetics of Antisocial Drug Dependence Study) that began in 1993. Setting
Multi-site sample recruited in San Diego,
California and Denver, Colorado, USA. Participants
A total of 1463 clinical probands were recruited through the
juvenile correctional system, court-mandated substance abuse treatment programs and correctional schools, along with
1399 of their siblings, and 904 controls. Measurements
Mortality and cause-of-death were assessed via National Death
Index search (released October, 2017). Findings
There were 104 deaths documented among 3766 (1168 female)
adolescents and young adults (average age 16.79 years at assessment, 32.69 years at death/censoring). Mortality
hazard for clinical probands and their siblings was 4.99 times greater than that of controls (95% confidence inter-
val = 2.40–10.40; P < 0.001). After accounting for demographic characteristics, site, clinical status, familial dependence
and shared contributions of CD and SUD, CD independently predicted mortality hazard, whereas SUD severity did not.
Conclusions
In the United States, youth with conduct and substance use disorders and their siblings face far greater risk
of premature death than demographically similar community controls. In contrast to substance use disorder severity,
conduct disorder is a robust predictor of unique variance in all-cause mortality hazard beyond other risk factors.

INTRODUCTION
Adolescence and early adulthood are periods of elevated
risk for unnatural death; homicide, suicide and uninten-
tional injury accounted for 71% of the 936 000 deaths of
young people in the United States (aged 15–29 years)
between 1999 and 2016 [1]. However, the risk of early
death is not distributed evenly. American youth who
engage in risk behaviors, such as substance abuse and
criminal activities, are two to nine times more likely to
die prematurely than their general population counter-
parts [2–5], and their deaths are disproportionately caused
by homicide, legal intervention and motor vehicle acci-
dents [2–10]. Youth with conduct- or substance-related
problems (referred to hereafter as adolescents with
externalizing problems) can often be identified through
involvement
in
juvenile
correction
systems
and/or
placement in treatment programs; therefore, they comprise

 a prime target for intervention and prevention efforts.
Nevertheless, our current understanding of the indepen-
dent contributions of potentially modifiable risk factors for
mortality hazard—information crucial to the success of
such efforts—is incomplete.
Previous research has identified numerous demo-
graphic variables and individual differences that predict
premature mortality among adolescents and young
adults with externalizing problems, including male sex
[3,4,7,11], minority ethnic status (i.e. Black/African
American or Latino) [2–4,7,9,11], substance abuse
[2,3,5,6,11–13] and previous criminal history [2,7,9].
These findings mirror studies of mortality in previously
incarcerated individuals [14–20]. However, with few
exceptions [6,11], recent studies have compared the
mortality risk for youth with externalizing problems to
those
from
retrospectively
obtained
population-level
data rather than prospectively ascertained comparison
cohorts [2–4,7,12,21–24]. Additionally, no prior study
has analyzed the independent contributions of conduct
disorder (CD) and substance use disorders (SUD) among
legally ascertained youth to determine hazard of premature
death despite evidence of substantial psychiatric morbidity
in delinquent youth populations [25] and elevated
mortality risk in clinically ascertained youth [5,11].
Further, although both genetic and environmental familial
factors contribute to conduct problems and substance
abuse [26–28], no study has examined whether these
identified risk factors for premature death account for
independent or redundant variance beyond that explained
by demographics, or whether familial effects remain salient
after accounting for individual differences. In particular, it
remains unclear whether severity of substance abuse
increases mortality hazard after accounting for CD, a point
of clinical relevance given that several researchers have
suggested that further dissemination and implementation
of SUD treatments will reduce mortality in youth with
externalizing problems [5,13]. Finally, it is unknown
whether risk for premature death is heightened among
siblings of adolescents with externalizing problems, and
whether any differences between clinically ascertained
youth and their siblings are evident after accounting for
individual differences in CD and SUD severity.
In light of these current limitations, the present study
sought to examine the independent mortality hazard
conferred
by
previously
identified
risk
factors.
We
addressed the following aims in a multi-site, longitudinal,
prospective cohort study of youth ascertained for CD and
SUD (clinical probands), their siblings and matched
community controls:
1 Comparison of mortality risk and cause of death
between clinical probands, their siblings and controls.
We hypothesized that mortality risk will be highest in
the clinical probands and that shared familial factors
will place their siblings at elevated risk with respect to
controls (although not at the level of the clinical
probands). Additionally, we expected that CD- and
SUD-related causes of death (e.g. homicide, legal
intervention and overdose) would account for group
differences.
2 Examination of the independent and simultaneous risk
for premature death conferred by CD and SUD severity,
beyond demographic variables and controlling for
within-family dependence, among youth with external-
izing problems and community controls.
We hypothesized that individual differences in CD and
SUD severity would explain unique variation in mortality
risk beyond that due to clinical/control status and
demographic factors.
METHODS
Participants
This prospective cohort study examined a sample of youth
ascertained for CD and SUD [total 3766 (1168 female);
clinical probands; n = 1463 (254 female)], their siblings
[n = 1399 (651 female)], community controls matched to
clinical proband demographics by age and sex [n = 401
(35 female)] and their siblings [n = 503 (228 female)];
distinguishing between matched controls and their siblings
failed to impact any of our results substantially, so we col-
lapsed these individuals into a single designation of controls
for clarity (results presented in Supporting information, Ta-
ble S1 illustrate that this choice did not affect primary con-
clusions) participating in a study of familial transmission
and genetic linkage of SUD and CD between 1993 and
2016 (Genetics of Antisocial Drug Dependence Study)
[29–32]. Clinical probands were recruited from individuals
currently involved in or referred to residential and
outpatient treatment facilities for substance abuse and de-
linquency in the Denver, Colorado area (n = 941) from ad-
judicated adolescents involved in the Colorado juvenile
correctional system (n = 288) and from two schools for
troubled
youth
in
the
San
Diego,
California
area
(n = 234). Within the Denver residential and out-patient
treatment site, three separate rounds of ascertainment oc-
curred following original funding and funding renewals;
we treat these as separate sites in our analyses. Within
the San Diego site, participants’ schools were not recorded,
preventing modeling efforts to account for additional de-
pendence due to nestingof observations within institutions,
although analysesexcluding theSan Diego site were consis-
tent with primary results (Supporting information, Table
S2). To be admitted to the study, clinical probands had to
be judged by staff as not currently psychotic, severely devel-
opmentally delayed, suicidal or homicidal and to have no
physical illness or current intoxication which would pre-
vent participation in treatment or evaluation.

 Research staff contacted those who met eligibility
requirements for the study and invited them to participate.
Written consent from a parent or guardian and assent from
the patient were obtained for all subjects after complete
description of the study
. Subjects were paid between $20
and $100 for participation, with payment increasing over
time. The respective institutional review boards approved
all procedures. The mortality data-collection period lasted
through the end of 2016, with an average age at assess-
ment of 16.79 years [standard deviation (SD) = 2.75]
and an average age at study conclusion or death of
32.69 years (SD = 5.04). Additional demographic informa-
tion is presented in Table 1.
Measures
Demographic measures
Information regarding age, sex, race, and ethnicity was
collected by self-report at enrollment.
Substance abuse/dependence
Substance use was assessed via the Composite Interna-
tional Diagnostic Interview–Substance Abuse Module
(CIDI-SAM) [33]. The CIDI-SAM provided diagnostic
data regarding the life-time occurrence of four abuse
symptoms and seven dependence symptoms on 10different
drug classes [tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, amphet-
amines, sedatives, opiates, phencyclidine (PCP), hallucino-
gens and inhalants], according to DSM-IV criteria [34,35].
The number of substances used on at least five separate
occasions and the abuse/dependence symptom count per
such substance were obtained. From this, we obtained
a
substance
abuse/dependence
vulnerability
(SADV)
index by calculating participants’ average number of
abuse/dependence symptoms per substance, an approach
that has been shown to maximize trait heritability [32].
The decision to use SADV was made a priori. Relevant
results were tested for sensitivity to this approach by
repeating analyses with multiple alternative variables: the
total number of abuse/dependence symptoms across
substances, the maximum number of abuse/dependence
symptoms for a given substance among substances and
substance-dependence
diagnosis
(e.g.
see
Supporting
information, Table S3 for model based on dependence
diagnosis); these substitutions did not influence our results
and we present analyses that used SADV
.
Conduct disorder
Life-time CD symptom count was assessed using the
Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC) accord-
ing to DSM-III-R or DSM-IV criteria depending on the time
of study enrollment [36,37]. Participants were asked to
answer questions about individual CD symptoms. The
DSM-III-R criteria included 13 symptoms of CD, and the
DSM-IV included two additional symptoms. Earlier samples
usingtheDSM-III-Rcriteria(n=916)werescoredusingthe
DSM-IV criteria for compatibility with newer samples (with
the earlier 916 participants missing scores for two items).
Among clinical probands who were assessed for all
DSM-IV criteria, DSM-III-R- and DSM-IV-derived symptom
counts were correlated strongly (r = 0.98, P < 0.001). We
present only results based on DSM-IV criteria.

 Mortality
Mortality and cause of death data were obtained through
a search of the National Death Index for all participants
from the year of study enrollment to the end of 2016
(released
October
2017)
[38]
for
determination
of
mortality status, as suggested by the National Center for
Health Statistics [38]. International Classification of
Disease 10 (ICD-10) classifications were hand-coded as
falling into eight non-mutually exclusive categories: (non-
traffic) physical accidents, medical conditions, traffic
accidents, assault, suicide, substance-related incidents,
legal intervention-related incidents and firearm-related
incidents [39]. For example, death due to ‘intentional
self-harm by handgun discharge’ was coded as both
suicide- and firearm-related. Specific coding used was
verified by a licensed physician and patterns of overlap are
presented in Supporting information, Fig. S1.
Analyses
Primary analyses were conducted using the coxme package
[40] in the R computing environment [41]. Frailty models
(also known as Cox proportional hazards models with
Gaussian random effects) were used to examine the
association between mortality hazard and predictor
variables and covariates while controlling for dependence
between siblings via a random intercept (frailty) term
among both clinical and control subjects. First, univariate
frailty models were employed (Table 2) to examine the
contributions of sex, sample, ethnicity, clinical/control des-
ignation, proband/sibling designation, substance/abuse
dependence vulnerability and CD symptom count to
hazard of mortality. Next, multivariate frailty models
(Table 3) were used to examine evidence of independent
contributions of these predictors. In all models, site was
included via the fixed effects of a set of orthogonal contrast
codes (see Table 2 for further details). To elucidate patterns
of redundancy among predictors, further analyses were
conducted with several informative subsets of predictors
(Supporting information, Table S5). Proportional hazards
assumptions were validated using the survival package
[43]. Listwise deletion was employed in primary analyses
(202 participants were missing measures of SADV or CD
symptoms), but possible consequences of non-random
missing data were examined in supplementary sensitivity
analyses (Supporting information, Table S4). For all
models, an alpha-level of 0.05 was used to determine
significance.
RESULTS
Cause of death
Substance-related
deaths
comprised
the
plurality of
observed deaths overall and throughout male and female
participants, accounting for 20 of 62 deaths among
clinical probands (32%), seven of 34 deaths among their
siblings (21%) and one of eight deaths among controls
(13%; Table 4). Traffic accidents were the second most
prominent cause, accounting for 12 deaths among clinical
probands (19%), seven among their siblings (21%) and one
among controls (13%). Violent deaths (related to suicide,
assault or legal intervention) together accounted for 26
deaths among clinical probands (42%), 10 among their
siblings (31%) and two among controls (26%). Note that
percentages for controls are poor estimates, as mortality
was relatively uncommon. Additionally, three deaths
classified as suicides were also classified as substance-
related, as overdose was the mechanism of suicide (see
Supporting information, Fig. S1 for patterns of overlap
between causes).

 Univariate frailty models
After accounting for lack of independence due to family, all
predictors other than site (χ2
(4) = 0.47, P = 0.976) and
ethnicity (χ2
(3) = 3.59, P = 0.309) evidenced contributions
to hazard of mortality (Table 2). Males had 2.81 times the
expected hazard as females (Z = 3.56, P < 0.001) and
clinical probands had 1.95 times the expected hazard as
their siblings (Z = 3.07, P = 0.002) who, in turn, had
3.58 times the expected hazard, as did controls (Z = 3.27,
P = 0.001). Single average symptom per substance in
SADVand single symptom increases in CD were associated,
respectively, with 1.16- and 1.18-fold increases in expected
hazard (Z = 3.92, P < 0.001; Z = 5.68, P < 0.001).
Multivariate frailty models
Not all predictors evidenced independent contributions to
hazard in models with greater saturation (Supporting infor-
mation, Table S5). Specifically, independent contributions
of SADV were not evident in any models including group
or CD symptoms simultaneously (min. P = 0.190). The
fully saturated model (Table 3) provided evidence for
independent contributions of sex [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.09,
Z = 2.29, P = 0.020], clinical/control contrast (HR = 4.20,
Z = 3.32, P = 0.001) and CD symptoms (HR = 1.09,
Z = 2.20, P = 0.028), but not for SADV (HR = 0.98,
Z = �0.30, P = 0.770) or for clinical proband/sibling
contrast (HR = 1.14, Z = 0.47, P = 0.640). However,
siblings of clinical probands continued to evidence greater
adjusted hazards than controls (HR = 3.58, Z = 3.21,
P = 0.001). Using total number of abuse/dependence
symptoms or maximal number of abuse/dependence
symptoms for any given substance not change this pattern
of results (max. P = 0.037 for terms associated CD
symptom count, min. P = 0.54 for terms associated with
alternative substance abuse variables). Effects of site or
ethnicity were not evident in any of the models (Table 2,
Supporting
information, Table
S5).
Additionally,
we
conducted a series of sensitivity analyses examining possi-
ble consequences of multiple schemes of non-random
missingness of baseline predictors. Our results suggested
that such artifacts were unlikely to have driven our primary
conclusions (Supporting information, Table S4, Fig. S2).
As we found little evidence for an independent
contribution of SADV after accounting CD symptoms and
additional covariates, we re-estimated the full multivariate
frailty model twice, once substituting binary diagnoses of
substance dependence and CD for SADVand CD symptoms,
respectively (Supporting information, Table S3), and again
including a SADV × CD symptoms product term in addition
to their simple effects (Supporting information, Table S6).
Results derived from the diagnosis-based model were
directionally consistent with those of the primary frailty
model, but with greater uncertainty regarding slope
estimates. Specifically, CD diagnosis was no longer signifi-
cant (HR = 1.43, Z = 1.29, P = 0.200), due presumably
to the reduction in power associated with dichotomizing
continuous predictors and greater collinearity with the
clinical versus control contrast (Supporting information,
Table S3). There was no strong evidence of an interaction
between SADV and CD symptoms (HR = 1.01, Z = 0.49,
P = 0.330) and simple effects were directionally consistent
with the primary model excluding the interaction term
(Fig. 1, Supporting information, Table S6).
DISCUSSION
The present prospective, multi-site study examined demo-
graphic and psychiatric predictors of early mortality in a
sample of youth ascertained for CD and SUD, their siblings
and community controls. This study is the first, to our
knowledge, to distinguish between the relative risk for
premature death conferred by individual differences versus

 familial factors and to examine the independent risk
conferred by SADV after accounting for CD symptoms,
demographic factors and dependence due to family. In line
with hypotheses, clinical probands evidenced significantly
higher mortality hazard than their siblings who, in turn,
evidenced greater hazard than controls. Substance-related
and
violent
causes
accounted
for
the
majority of
deaths among clinical probands and their siblings, with
the substance-related causes accounting for 32% of
deaths among clinical probands (Table 4). Results from
univariate
models
confirmed
previous
findings
that
male sex [3,4,7,11], conduct problems [2,7,9] and SAD
[2–7,11–13] are each associated with increased mortality
risk (Table 2).
Contrary to expectation, multivariate model results
suggested that the risk conferred by individual differences
in SADV was largely redundant with that due to CD
(Table 3, Supporting information, Table S5). That is, there
was no discernible independent effect of SADV in any
models accounting for CD symptoms or clinical ascertain-
ment status, although the latter accounted for independent
variance regardless of which covariates were presented in
the model. However, consistent with previous findings
[3,5,13,19,44,45], substance-related causes comprised
the largest proportion of observed deaths and occurred
disproportionately among clinical probands and their
siblings vis-á-vis controls. In light of these findings, we echo
previous researchers’ recommendations [5,13,16], that
intervention and prevention efforts include SUD treatment
within constellation treatment foci including additional
psychiatric resources and social services.
Further complicating this discussion, the determination
of cause of death as substance-related versus suicide is
often ambiguous with respect to available evidence, and
misclassification errors are ubiquitous [46–48]. Some
researchers have suggested that substance-related suicides
are particularly likely to be classified erroneously as
accidental or undetermined [47,48]. The degree to which
deaths classified as physical or traffic accidents might have
indirect consequences of substance use is unknown.
Additional limitations to the present study include the lack
of a comprehensive measure of socio-economic status
(SES), inadequate measures of race/ethnicity among
multi-ethnic individuals (Table 1) and potential regional
specificity to site locations (urban Colorado and southern
California), although the first was mitigated partially by
the inclusion of familial random intercepts and there was
no evidence of site differences amongour samples. Further-
more, the contrasts between clinical probands and their
siblings may have reflected ascertainment procedures
rather than individual differences. That is, it is possible that
the older or younger siblings of probands might themselves
have been ascertained as probands had ascertainment
occurred at a different date. Additionally, as the present

Observed cause-of-death information as reported by the National Death Index split by group and by sex. Causes were established by categorizing International Disease Classification 10 codes and were verified by a licensed physician. Not all
categories were mutually exclusive; for example, death due to ‘intentional self-harm by handgun discharge’ was coded as both suicide- and firearm-related. Patterns of overlap are presented in Supporting information, Fig. S1.

 study focused upon individuals ascertained specifically for
severe externalizing behaviors, their siblings and commu-
nity controls, the extent to which our results might gener-
alize to individuals with moderate externalizing problems is
unclear. That is, our results concerning the independent
risk attributable to substance versus conduct problems
might not generalize to youth with subclinical externaliz-
ing problems or who avoid legal or clinical attention.
Further,
our
results
do
not
reflect
the
diagnostic
criteria currently employed in the DSM-5, although we
are skeptical that employing DSM-V criteria would have
altered
our
results
dramatically;
symptoms
for
CD
remained unchanged and substance abuse/dependence
symptoms saw only the replacement of the legal troubles
criterion with a craving criterion [49,50]. The utility of
the callous–unemotional traits CD subtype specifier in
predicting premature mortality remains unknown. Lastly,
the National Death Index search probably failed to identify
some deceased participants; a family member reported the
death of one participant that our search did not identify as
deceased. In the present study, the full name and date of
birth were available for all participants, and social security
numbers were available for a subset of participants.
Previous research suggests that the sensitivity and
specificity of NDI searches are greater than 90% even for
those missing social security numbers [51]. However,
whether these estimates generalize to samples with
relatively high incidences of unnatural death early in life
is unknown.
The degree to which forensic artifacts surrounding
cause-of-death classification account for the incidence of
substance-related deaths among clinically and legally
ascertained youth comprises a prime target for future
research efforts. Additionally, future work should examine
the independent contributions of SUD and CD to premature
mortality in the context of thorough measures of SES.
Finally, we wish to caution that although it remains
unclear which domains comprise the most pressing target
for intervention and prevention efforts (e.g. targeting SUD
versus general psychiatric care), it is clear that youth
identifiedwith conduct problems areatextremeriskfor pre-
mature mortality and in critical need of greater resources.
