ABSTRACT
Novel interventions that reestablish endogenous insulin secretion and thereby halt progressive
end-organ damage and prolong survival of patients with autoimmune Type 1 diabetes mellitus
(T1DM) are urgently needed. While this is currently accomplished with allogeneic pancreas or islet
transplants, their utility is significantly limited by both the scarcity of organ donors and life-long
need for often-toxic antirejection drugs. Coadministering islets with bone marrow-derived mesen-
chymal stem cells (MSCs) that exert robust immune-modulating, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic,
and angiogenic actions, improves intrahepatic islet survival and function. Encapsulation of insulin-
producing cells to prevent immune destruction has shown both promise and failures. Recently,
stem cell-derived insulin secreting b-like cells induced euglycemia in diabetic animals, although
their clinical use would still require encapsulation or anti-rejection drugs. Instead of focusing on
further improvements in islet transplantation, we demonstrate here that the intraperitoneal
administration of islet-sized “Neo-Islets” (NIs), generated by in vitro coaggregation of allogeneic,
culture-expanded islet cells with high numbers of immuno-protective and cyto-protective MSCs,
resulted in their omental engraftment in immune-competent, spontaneously diabetic nonobese
diabetic (NOD) mice. This achieved long-term glycemic control without immunosuppression and
without hypoglycemia. In preparation for an Food and Drug Administration-approved clinical trial
in dogs with T1DM, we show that treatment of streptozotocin-diabetic NOD/severe combined
immunodeficiency mice with identically formed canine NIs produced durable euglycemia, exclu-
sively mediated by dog-specific insulin. We conclude that this novel technology has significant
translational relevance for canine and potentially clinical T1DM as it effectively addresses both the
organ donor scarcity (>80 therapeutic NI doses/donor pancreas can be generated) and completely
eliminates the need for immunosuppression. STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE 2017;6:1631–

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess potent immune-modulating, anti-inflammatory, pro-
survival, and repair-stimulating activities. In patients with juvenile Type 1 diabetes mellitus
(T1DM), the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas are destroyed by auto-immune attacks.
Treatment with insulin, a pancreas or pancreatic islet transplant will enhance patient survival
and reduce serious complications. However, transplants depend on potentially toxic anti-
rejection drugs, and there is a shortage of pancreas donors. We tested whether the therapeutic
activities of MSCs could be harnessed by combining them with healthy islet cells in cell clusters
(“Neo-Islets”) that are administered to a mouse model of T1DM. We show that Neo-Islets elimi-
nate the need for exogenous insulin in experimental T1DM and conclude that this novel ther-
apy has significant promise for the treatment of veterinary and human T1DM.
INTRODUCTION
The clinical need for novel technologies that effec-
tively treat patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus
(T1DM) and render them insulin-independent is
great and well documented. Endogenous insulin
replacement by pancreas or islet of Langerhans
transplants is currently the only treatment that
can achieve insulin-independence and provide sig-
nificant end organ protection in patients with

ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES FOR CELL-BASED CLINICAL
TRANSLATION
 autoimmune-mediated T1DM. However, the great shortage of
suitable pancreas donors combined with the need for repeated
islet transplants, requiring up to five donors each, continue to
limit the general availability of these expensive therapies [1, 2]. In
addition, both transplant modalities depend on the permanent
use of potentially toxic antirejection drugs [3–6].
Novel approaches to address these major limitations of islet
transplantation therapies have shown significant progress. Auto-
and allo-immune isolation of transplanted islet cells (ICs) is cur-
rently tested with various encapsulation technologies. Several of
these are showing promise while others have failed due to foreign
body reactions [7–11]. When insulin-producing b-cells are culture
expanded through outgrowth from freshly isolated islets, they
progressively de-differentiate and lose their ability to secrete insu-
lin [12–14]. Although partial in vitro redifferentiation is feasible,
this process is relatively inefficient [15]. For this reason, pancreatic
progenitor, embryonic stem and induced pluripotent stem cell
lines have recently been successfully used to generate cells that
closely resemble b-cells and that induce euglycemia in diabetic
animal models [16, 17], while their therapeutic use would still
require either encapsulation or anti-rejection drugs. Other signifi-
cant preclinical studies used the pleiotropic actions of bone mar-
row or adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), that is,
their well-documented immune-modulating, anti-inflammatory
and complex trophic activities, and showed that the survival and
function of transplanted islets was improved when islets were
cocultured with MSCs and coadministered with islets or when
administered islets were precoated with MSCs [18–22]. A clinical
trial in which MSCs alone were administered to patients with
T1DM demonstrated a modest improvement in b-cell function, a
response that was previously observed in preclinical studies [23].
This approach by several groups clearly demonstrated that inclu-
sion of MSCs in islet transplantation technologies does modestly
reduce the number of needed islet donors.
Mindful of these important observations, we chose in the cur-
rent study a new strategy that did not focus on the further
improvement of islet transplantation technologies but instead
tested whether the inclusion of higher numbers of healthy MSCs
(adipose or bone marrow derived) in freshly formed “Neo-Islets”
(NIs), Three-dimensional (3D) aggregates of culture-expanded allo-
geneic ICs and MSCs, could be used to potentiate the pleiotropic
effects that the small numbers of MSCs, as pericytes, physiologi-
cally exert in islets [24]. In this fashion, we reasoned a substan-
tially expanded MSC component (from �2% in normal isles to
�50%) in these NIs should immune-protect, through close range
signaling, culture-expanded and coaggregated islet and stem cells
in vivo. In addition, we postulated that this approach would also
make available the robust anti-apoptotic paracrine actions of
MSCs and their released nanovesicles to neighboring ICs, com-
bined with their pro-angiogenic and potent anti-inflammatory
activities [25]. Together, allogeneic NIs that are engineered in this
fashion should possess, we hypothesized, the ability to provide
adequate auto- and allo-immune isolation of their cell compo-
nents in vivo by creating a protective microenvironment where
culture expanded ICs can resume their physiological endocrine
and other functions, that is, reestablish euglycemia in the clinically
relevant NOD mouse model of auto-immune T1DM.
Accordingly, NIs of approximate islet size were generated in
vitro from culture expanded, dedifferentiated ICs [12–14] and
bone marrow-derived MSCs of C57Bl/6 mice. NIs were adminis-
tered to spontaneously diabetic, immune-competent NOD mice
that develop auto-immune T1DM that largely resembles human
T1DM [26]. This allogeneic treatment protocol was chosen as it
models the most common clinical situation in recipients of pan-
creas or islet transplants. By not using anti-rejection drugs or
encapsulation devices, we directly tested our hypothesis that high
numbers of MSCs in NIs do enable ICs to survive and redifferenti-
ate into normally functioning endocrine cells. This treatment
established long-term glycemic control in NOD mice, which dem-
onstrates that NIs survive, engraft and redifferentiate into
functional endocrine cells in vivo, and that both allo- and auto-
immune protection is achieved. Importantly, following i.p. admin-
istration the NIs were taken up by the well-vascularized omentum
[27, 28] where they engrafted long term and redifferentiated into
physiologically insulin-secreting cells, delivering insulin into the
portal system of the liver [29]. Simultaneously, re-expression of
other islet-specific hormones occurred. Identical injection of NIs
into nondiabetic animals resulted in omental engraftment without
causing hypoglycemia, further demonstrating regulated islet hor-
mone secretion. In preparation for a pilot study in pet dogs with
T1DM (INAD # 021776), streptozotocin-diabetic nonobese dia-
betic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice were
treated by identical protocol with canine NIs (cNIs). In these,
euglycemia was readily and durably induced and intraperitoneal
Glucose Tolerance Tests (i.p. GTTs) were normalized by the exclu-
sive release of canine-specific insulin. Taken together, the present
data demonstrate that the complex pleiotropic actions of MSCs,
as hypothesized, can be readily harnessed to protect cultured ICs,
and when coaggregated with them in NIs and administered i.p.,
facilitate long-term glycemic control in mice with autoimmune
T1DM.We conclude that these novel observations have significant
translational relevance for the treatment of both canine and
human T1DM.

Reagents
All reagents used and their sources are listed in Supporting Infor-
mation Table S1.
Cell Isolation and Culture
Islets and adipose derived MSCs were Isolated and cultured from
mice and dogs as previously reported [30–34]. Purified human
islets from nondiabetic subjects (Prodo Laboratories, Irvine, CA),
and human adipose derived MSCs (P1, Lonza, Walkersville, MD)
were identically cultured. See Supporting Information data. Prior
to NI formation, cultured MSCs were characterized as in our previ-
ous publication [35]. Cell viability was assessed using fluorescein
diacetate (FDA) and propidium iodide as per the manufacturers’
instructions.
Induction of Indoleamine 2,3 Dioxygenase
Canine MSCs were tested by rtPCR at passage 2 (P2) for induction
of indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO-1) in response to overnight
culture in DMEM-F12 (Sigma, www.sigmaaldrich.com) 110%
canine serum (Golden West Biologicals, www.goldenwestbio.
com) 1 10 ng/ml canine interferon gamma (IFNg, R&D Systems,
www.rndsystems.com). Results from IFNg treated cultures were
normalized to those of identically passaged and cultured (but
without IFNg) cells, and expressed as Log10RQ (n 5 4 independ-
ent experiments).

STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
 Neo-Islet Formation
MSCs (P1 to P5) and ICs (P1 to P2) were cocultured in DMEM-
F12 1 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS; Hyclone, www.fishersci.com,
for murine or human cells) or dog serum (for canine cells) at a 1:1
ratio in ultra-low adhesion surface culture dishes (Corning, www.
corning.com), and NIs formed overnight. Control MSC and Islet
cell clusters were formed by the same method. Prior to in vivo
administration, NIs were tested by reverse transcription polymer-
ase chain reaction (rtPCR) for expression of islet and MSC associ-
ated genes (see below), and Fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) for determining the ratio of MSCs to ICs post-formation.
Staining of Cells and Neo Islets
Where indicated, MSCs were stained with Cell Tracker Green
(green, Life Technologies, www.thermofisher.com), and passaged
ICs were stained with Lipophilic Tracer DiI (red, Life Technologies)
according to the manufacturers’ instructions.
Neo-Islet Cellular Ratio Assessment
NIs were formed overnight from cell tracker green stained MSCs
and unstained ICs, collected and dissociated to single cell prepara-
tions (30 minutes Accumax Innovative Cell Technologies, www.
accutase.com), and analyzed by FACS (BD FACScan Analyzer, BD
Biosciences, www.bdbiosciences.com) for percent green (MSCs)
versus unstained (ICs) cells.
Immunohistochemistry
Harvested organs were fixed, paraffin embedded, sectioned and
deparaffinized as previously described [35], then stained for indi-
cated antigens by standard methods (see Supporting Information
data).
rtPCR
RNA was extracted from 1x10e6 cells (Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit,
Qiagen, www.qiagen.com). Reverse transcription was performed
using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Applied Biosystems,
www.thermofisher.com) for 60 minutes at 428C. rtPCR was carried
out in duplicate using species-specific TaqMan primers (Applied
Biosystems; see Supporting Information Table S2) and the ABS
7500 Real Time PCR System. RQ was calculated through normal-
ization to internal controls (beta actin and beta 2 microglobulin,
and the machine’s software. Results are presented as log10(RQ)6
log10(RQmin and RQmax). Differences greater or less than
log10(RQ) 2 or 22 were considered significant. (see Supporting
Information data).
Animal Care and Models
Animal studies were conducted in adherence to the NIH Guide for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and were supervised and
approved by an institutional veterinarian and member of the
IACUC. Mouse experiments used female (a) C57Bl/6 (Harlan,
www.envigo.com), (b) NOD (Jackson Laboratory, www.jax.org), (c)
Nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice
(NOD/SCID, Harlan), weighing between 15 and 35 g. All treat-
ments were conducted under isoflurane anesthesia. Care and
anesthesia details are in Supporting Information .
Insulin Treatment
Where indicated, insulin was administered via slow-release, sub-
cutaneous insulin pellets (Linbits, LinShin, www.linshincanada.
com; see Supporting Information data) following the manufac-
turer’s instructions.
Blood Glucose Monitoring
In all in vivo studies, blood glucose concentrations were assessed
twice per week via tail vein sampling, using a OneTouch Ultra 2
glucometer (Johnson and Johnson, www.jnj.com, level of detec-
tion, 20–600 mg glucose/dl).
Spontaneous Diabetes
Female NOD mice develop T1DM spontaneously between 12 and
20 weeks of age. Diabetes was confirmed by nonfasting blood glu-
cose levels of >300 mg/dl on 3 separate days. Mice entered
experimental or control groups at ages 13–21 weeks of age.
Streptozotocin-Induced T1DM
C57Bl/6 and NOD/SCID mice were rendered diabetic with 3–5 i.p.
doses (1 per day) of 50–75 mg/kg body weight (b.wt.) STZ (Sigma),
freshly dissolved in 20 mM citrate buffer, pH 4.5, and randomized
after diabetes was confirmed as above.
Treatment Protocols
See Table 1 for details. For all diabetes models, blood glucose levels
were controlled with Linbits administration prior to treatment.
Therapies were administered under light isoflurane anesthesia
once blood glucose levels were controlled, and prior to Linbits
expiring (1–3 weeks post-implantation). After Linbits expired, no
further insulin was given. Unless otherwise indicated, NIs were
dosed at 2 3 10e5 NIs/kg b.wt., and administered i.p. suspended
in vehicle (0.5 ml serum free DMEM). Where stained or fluorescent
cells were administered, omenta, livers, spleens, lungs, kidneys,
and pancreata were harvested upon euthanasia and examined by
fluorescence microscopy for the presence of fluorescently labeled
NIs. Other endpoints are given in Table 1 and Results.
In Vivo Imaging
In vivo imaging of DiR (Life Technologies) stained NIs was per-
formed in anesthetized mice using the Li-Cor, Pearl Impulse
imager (LiCor, www.licor.com).
IP Glucose Tolerance Tests
i.p. GTTs were conducted in 3 vehicle-treated and 5 cNI-treated
STZ-diabetic NOD/SCID mice by standard procedures (see Sup-
porting Information data), and canine- and mouse-specific insulin
levels were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA).
Tumor Formation and Ectopic Maldifferentiation of
MSCs
Upon euthanasia, all harvested organs were examined histologi-
cally for tumors or evidence for ectopic maldifferentiation (osteo-,
adipo- or chondrogenic).
Allo-IgG Response
Aliquots of �5310e4 C57Bl/6 MSCs, ICs, dissociated NIs or disso-
ciated ICs (Accumax) were incubated with 500 ll of serum
obtained upon euthanasia from NI-, vehicle-, or islet-treated NOD
mice (sera obtained at day 77 for NI and vehicle-treated, and day
14 for islet-treated mice), for 30 minutes at room temperature,
centrifuged (600g for 5 minutes), incubated with cy3-conjugated
goat-anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, www.

minutes fixed, and analyzed by FACS.
Spleen Cell Preparation and T Cell FACS Analysis
Spleens and omenta were sectioned into small pieces, triturated
in 13 Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS, Roche, www.roche.com),
passed through a sterile 40 mm strainer (BD) and washed with
PBS. Red blood cells were lysed with 13 ACK (Life Technologies)
for 10 minutes. Cells were washed with 13 PBS and used directly
for FACS staining assays. T and Treg cells were identified using a
Mouse T Lymphocyte kit (BD) and a Treg Detection kit (Miltenyi
Biotech, www.miltenyibiotec.com). 0.5310e6 cells were stained
per antibody, and 1310e4 events were counted by FACS (see Sup-
porting Information data).
Statistical Analysis
Data are expressed as Mean6 SEM or Mean6 95% confidence
interval, as indicated. Primary data were collected using Excel
(Microsoft, Redmond,WA), and statistical analyses were carried our
using Prism (GraphPad, San Diego, California).Two-tailed t tests and
one way ANOVA with Bonferroni Post Test analysis and confidence
interval of 95% were used to assess differences between data
means. A p value of <.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS
To test our central hypothesis in a clinically informative auto-
immune TIDM model, we first examined whether the i.p. adminis-
tration of in vitro generated allogeneic NIs could reestablish
euglycemia in spontaneously diabetic NOD mice as a reflection of
(a) their survival, (b) the redifferentiation of ICs contained in the
NIs into functional insulin-producing cells in vivo and re-
expression of other islet-specific genes, and (c) the MSC-mediated
cyto-, allo- and auto-immune protection of the transplanted NIs
[36–43]. Like humans, NOD mice develop a T-cell mediated, auto-
immune form of T1DM [26, 44, 45].
Formation of NIs
NIs of approximate islet size (150 lm) were prepared as illustrated
in Figure 1A. We furthermore confirmed that comparable NIs
could be generated from both canine and human ICs and MSCs
(Fig. 1B). At 24 hours. post-formation, NIs remained comprised of
Figure 1.

 approximately 50% MSCs and 50% ICs (Supporting Information
Fig. S1).
Starting Materials for NIs: Growth and Characterization
of ICs and MSCs
Upon culture of islets, ICs proliferate and dedifferentiate [12–14].
Upon passaging, IC-associated gene expression levels decreased.
Their gene expression pattern was distinct from that of cultured
MSCs (Supporting Information Fig. S2). All ICs were used at P1-P2
for NI formation. By expanding ICs to P2 and using them at this
passage, one canine pancreas, assuming �45,000 islets per pan-
creas, will yield at least 80 therapeutic doses.
All MSCs met the minimal criteria [46–48] and were used at
P1–P5. See Supporting Information data and Supporting Informa-
tion Figures S3 and S4 for details of epitope expression, trilineage
differentiation, INFg-induced IDO-1 expression, role of passage
number on gene expression and NI formation, and glucose stimu-
lated insulin secretion by freshly formed NIs.
Treatment of Spontaneously Diabetic NOD Mice with
Allogeneic, C57Bl/6 NIs
Allogeneic, C57Bl/6 mouse NIs (2x10e5/kg b.wt., N 5 6, see Table
1 and Fig. 1A), 2x10e5 C57Bl/6 mouse islets (N5 3), or vehicle
(N5 6) were administered i.p. to spontaneously diabetic NOD
mice after blood glucose levels were normalized with slow-release
insulin pellets (Linbits) in order to reduce glucotoxic effects on the
transplanted cells [14, 49, 50] and to enhance their in vivo redif-
ferentiation [14, 16, 17]. By day 35–40 post-Linbit treatment, Lin-
bits are depleted, and hyperglycemia redeveloped in both islet-
and vehicle-treated NOD mice, as expected [51]. Strikingly, blood
glucose levels in NI-treated animals remained near normal (Fig.
2A). These data suggest that (a) the NIs engraft and survive, (b)
the ICs within the NIs redifferentiate in vivo, providing the mouse
with a new, endogenous source of insulin and potentially other
islet hormones, and (c) the MSCs contained in the NIs effectively
provide cyto-protection and allo- and auto-immune-isolation of
the NIs in NOD mice, and together establishing glycemic control in
this clinically relevant T1DM model. Next, we explored mecha-
nisms by which this was achieved.
NOD Mice Do Not Mount an Allo-Immune IgG Response
to the MSCs and ICs of NIs
To examine whether ICs and MSCs contained in the NIs are pro-
tected from a humoral immune attack [52], we assessed whether
sera from normoglycemic, NI-treated NOD mice contained IgG
antibodies directed against either the MSCs or cultured ICs in the
Figure 2.
Allogeneic NI-treatment established euglycemia in spontaneously diabetic nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice without inducing an IgG
antibody response. (A): Blood glucose levels (mean 6 SEM) of NOD mice normalized with Linbits (day 0), then infused i.p. on day 20 post Lin-
bit therapy with 2310e5 C57Bl/6 NI/kg b.wt. (N 5 6; open bars), vehicle (N 5 6; black bars), or 2310e5 islets (N 5 3; hashed bars). While
vehicle- and islet-treated mouse blood glucose levels increased when Linbits expired (approximately day 35), euglycemia was maintained
long term in NI-treated mice, implying IC redifferentiation into insulin producing cells and protection from allo- and autoimmune attacks. Nor-
mal blood glucose level, hashed line. *, p < .05 versus vehicle treated group. (B): IgG responses (FACS; Mean 6 SEM) in treated-NOD mouse

experiment depicted in (A) collected upon euthanasia (day 77), and from intact C57Bl/6 (allogeneic) islet-treated NOD mice (positive control)
14 days post i.p. islet administration. Treated-NOD mice show robust IgG responses to islets, but not to NIs nor to the cells from which NIs
are composed. Antibody mediated rejection of NIs appears unlikely since (a) NOD mice remained euglycemic, and (b) FACS data show no IgG
response to these cells in otherwise immune competent NOD mice. *, p < .05 versus the other treatments. Abbreviations: NI, neo-islets;

the i.p. administration of identical numbers of allogeneic (C57Bl/
6), freshly isolated islets used as a positive control, elicited a
robust antibody response (Fig. 2B). The lack of an IgG antibody
response to the cells that are used to form the allogeneic NIs,
along with the achievement of long term euglycemia, indicates
that the NIs also provide humoral, allo-immune protection to the
transplanted cells.
NIs Spontaneously Engraft in the Murine Omentum and
Produce Insulin
As shown in Figure 3A, fluorescence in vivo imaging of a euglyce-
mic NOD mouse treated 10 weeks previously with DiR-labeled,
egfp1 NIs demonstrates their persistent location in the upper
abdomen. Histological examination upon euthanasia of omenta,
pancreata, spleens, livers, lungs, and kidneys from NI-treated NOD
mice from Figure 2A revealed the presence of the egfp1 NI only
in the animals’ omenta (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, sections of the
omentum stained positive for insulin (Fig. 3C left panel), while
negative controls (Fig. 3C inset) and omenta from vehicle-treated,
diabetic NOD mice did not (Fig. 3C right panel). Their pancreata
showed high-grade insulitis, as expected (Supporting Information
Fig. S5), indicating that euglycemia was achieved through physio-
logic insulin secretion by the NIs, not islet recovery. Importantly,
there was no histologic evidence for tumor formation or ectopic
maldifferentiation (adipo-, osteo-, chondrogenic) in any examined
organs. Additionally, Ki67 staining showed no evidence of prolifer-
ation of administered NIs in the omenta.
Inhibition of Autoimmune Response
Critical to effectively treating autoimmune T1DM with insulin pro-
ducing cells is the autoimmune isolation of those cells.The results
presented in Figure 2A demonstrate that the ICs within the NIs
are protected from NOD mouse autoimmune attack. As in human
T1DM, autoimmune beta cell destruction in NOD mice is medi-
ated by autoreactive CD41 Th1 cells, and is characterized by insu-
litis involving macrophage, CD41 and CD81 T-cell infiltration [26,
44, 45, 53]. It has been shown that allo-MSC administration either
alone [54–59] or with islets [18, 21–23, 60, 61] alleviates hypergly-
cemia in diabetic animals and humans partly by promoting expan-
sion of regulatory T cells and suppressing expansion of immune
cells through here confirmed Tgfb1 expression (Supporting Infor-
mation Figs. S2, S4) and IDO-1 upregulation (Supporting Informa-
tion Fig. S3C) [54, 58, 62–65]. To explore the putative immune-
modulating role of NI-contained MSCs in shielding the NIs from
autoimmune attack, we examined a select set of known MSC
immunomodulatory mechanisms as follows. Diabetic NOD mice
were treated i.p. with allogeneic C57Bl/6 islets (N 5 3) or with
allogeneic NIs (N 5 3). After 14 days, mice were euthanized.
Spleens and omenta were harvested and tested by FACS for the
percentages of CD3, CD4, CD8, FOXP3, CD25 positive cells. The
percent of CD3/CD4 and CD3/CD8 double positive cells (helper
and cytotoxic T lymphocytes) were significantly lower in spleen
cells of NI-treated versus Islet treated NOD mice, while the per-
cent of CD4/CD25/Foxp3 triple positive Tregs were significantly
increased in the spleens and omenta of NI-treated versus Islet
treated NOD mice (Fig. 4 and Supporting Information Fig. S6A,
S6B). While the number of animals tested is small, these results
are in agreement with others’ findings [54–56, 58, 60, 61] and
with our hypothesis that NIs, and specifically their MSC
component, promotes euglycemia in T1 diabetic mice through
modulation of the diabetogenic auto-immune response.
Collaboration of ICs and MSCs within NIs Is Essential to
Establishing Normoglycemia in Diabetic Animals
To explore the collaboration between ICs and MSCs in NIs, two
experiments using a readily controllable Streptozotocin (STZ)
model of T1DM in C57Bl/6 mice were conducted and are

 summarized in Figure 5 (see also Table 1). First, STZ-diabetic
C57Bl/6 mice were treated i.p. with 2310e5/kg b.wt. syngeneic
NIs (N 5 6) or with vehicle (N 5 6). Second, STZ-diabetic C57Bl/6
mice were treated i.p. with 2310e5/kg b.wt. control clusters com-
posed of either MSCs (P1; N5 5) or passaged ICs (P1; N 5 5)
alone. Importantly, the total number of cells in each generated
cell cluster was identical to that in NIs (�1,000 cells per cluster).
Three mice from the NI-treated group, and all mice from the con-
trol groups were euthanized at 12 weeks. The remaining 3 NI-
treated mice were followed for 21 weeks. Long-term (21 weeks)
euglycemia was obtained only in NI treated mice. Treatment with
control clusters only minimally reduced blood glucose levels when
IC clusters were given (Fig. 5A), demonstrating that both cell types
must be present within NIs to facilitate optimal glycemic control.
In Vivo Redifferentiation
Data from the NOD mouse experiment (Fig. 2), as well as from
their retrieved omenta (Fig. 3B) imply that the NIs redifferentiate
in vivo to produce sufficient insulin to render mice euglycemic.
Indeed, omenta retrieved from the euglycemic, C57Bl/6 NI-
treated mice at 21 weeks showed both engraftment of NIs and
significantly increased insulin, glucagon, somatostatin and Pdx1
gene expression compared to freshly formed NIs (Fig. 5B), demon-
strating effective in vivo redifferentiation of islet hormone-
expressing ICs. Furthermore, expression of Ins1 and Ins2 in whole
pancreata of STZ-diabetic mice was, as expected, significantly
reduced in all animals (Fig. 5C), indicating that euglycemia in NI-
treated mice was achieved by physiological insulin secretion
provided by omentally-engrafted NIs and not by residual pancre-
atic insulin.
Canine-Specific Insulin Secretion from cNIs in STZ-
Diabetic NOD/SCID Mice, and Return of Hyperglycemia
Upon Their Removal
Spontaneous diabetes mellitus in pet dogs is treated with insulin,
but up to 40% are euthanized primarily due to the burden associ-
ated with their care [66].Were we to demonstrate, in our Food and
Drug Administration approved pilot study (INAD 012776), that cNI
therapy was effective in dogs with T1DM, this would reduce eutha-
nasia rates and the burden on dog owners. Furthermore, dogs with
T1DM represent a clinically relevant large mammal model, provid-
ing potentially valuable information for envisioned clinical trials.
Treatment of NOD/SCID mice (routinely used for xenogeneic
protocols) with 2x10e5 cNI/kg b.wt. maintained euglycemia, and
significantly, surgical removal of the cNIs from treated, euglycemic
mice caused the reappearance of hyperglycemia (Fig. 6A). When
this group of mice was subjected to an i.p. GTT (Fig. 6B), only cNI-
treated mice had a normal response, and only these released
canine-specific insulin (Fig. 6C).Taken together, these data demon-
strate further that the NIs redifferentiate in vivo to produce and
secrete insulin physiologically in response to glucose.
Dose Dependency of Glycemic Control, and Control of
Remote Onset T1DM by cNIs
To prepare for the canine pilot study, either 8310e4 or 2310e5
cNIs/kg b.wt. (cNIs) were administered i.p. to STZ diabetic NOD/

mice, the percentages of regulatory T cells (Treg) were significantly increased, suggesting that NIs helped restore normoglycemia in NOD mice
(see Fig. 2) in part through immune-modulation. *, p < .05 versus islet-treated group. Representative FACS histograms of (A) through (H) are

 SCID mice as indicated in Table 1. cNIs lower blood glucose dose
dependently (Supporting Information Fig. S7A). Intraperitoneal
administration of 2x10e5 cNI/kg b.wt. to NOD/SCID mice with
remote onset STZ-induced DM, a potential model of therapy ini-
tiation later in the course of the disease, similarly restored eugly-
cemia (Supporting Information Fig. S7B).
Intraperitoneal NIs Do Not Cause Hypoglycemia in
Nondiabetic Mice
To further ascertain that NIs’ insulin delivery is physiologic and
does not cause hypoglycemia, nondiabetic C57Bl/6 mice were
treated i.p. either with 2x10e5/kg b.wt. syngeneic NIs or vehicle.
No animals developed hypoglycemia over time, and blood glucose
levels were identical to those in vehicle treated controls (Support-
ing Information Fig. S8A). Analogous experiments wherein nondia-
betic NOD/SCID mice were treated i.p. with either cNIs or vehicle
also did not result in hypoglycemia at any time point (Supporting
Information Fig. S8B).
DISCUSSION
The present study was designed as a de novo attempt to over-
come the principal hurdles that continue to limit the successful
treatment of autoimmune-mediated T1DM with a readily avail-
able, progenitor or stem cell based therapy [1, 44]. Specifically,
our investigations addressed (a) the shortage of suitable pancreas
donors for the preparation of adequate islet cell numbers, (b) the
difficulty of expanding b-cells in culture, (c) the permanent need
for potentially toxic anti-rejection drugs in islet and pancreas
transplants, (d) the alternative use of encapsulation devices for
the immune isolation of islet or progenitor cell transplants, (e) the
physiological delivery of insulin into the portal system of the liver,
all to be achieved with a minimally invasive mode of NI adminis-
tration, and by directly harnessing the complex pleiotropic actions
of MSCs, cell types that are free of ethical concerns [26, 36–40,
42, 67–69]. We reasoned that newly formed NIs in which high
numbers of healthy MSCs are combined with culture expanded
ICs that have undergone expansion and dedifferentiation, would
enable these cells, potentially aided by preservation of their epige-
netic memory, to re-differentiate in vivo to functioning b-cells [12,
14, 70], to survive, and to be shielded from inflammatory and
auto- and allo-immune attacks, thereby avoiding the need for
anti-rejection drugs or encapsulation devices. We previously
tested the fusion of ICs with MSCs, the creation of heterokaryons,
in order to achieve immune protection of the endocrine compo-
nent of such hybrid cells. We found this approach effective both in
vitro and in vivo. However, both the low fusion efficiency and
recent reports on the development of malignancies by fused cells
made us abandon this technology [71, 72].
Since both standard subcutaneous insulin injections and sub-
cutaneously placed encapsulated endocrine cells deliver insulin

gene expression levels were similarly decreased in all treatment groups versus those of hyperglycemic, vehicle-treated mice, it follows that
the blood glucose control seen in NI-treated mice was achieved by insulin secretion from omental NIs. NI 1 Neo-Islet. Abbreviations: IC, islet

 not into the portal vein of the liver, where up to 50% of it is inacti-
vated, but exposes peripheral tissues to potentially harmful,
supraphysiologic concentrations of this hormone [73, 74], we
tested whether the unique biological functions of the well vascu-
larized omentum, that is, the uptake of cells and foreign bodies,
could be exploited to incorporate NIs that are intraperitoneally
administered. Furthermore, as intrahepatic islet transplants are
inefficient, requiring up to 5 donors per often repeated treatment,
and being associated in high early losses of islets [1], a successful
omental engraftment of NIs would be highly advantageous. If
accomplished, it would facilitate their engraftment, redifferentia-
tion and physiological function within the omentum. In this fash-
ion, intraomentally secreted insulin would be, as is physiological,
directly delivered into the portal system of the liver. An additional
benefit the intraperitoneal location of NIs provides is the fact that
glucose sensing from this location is superior to that from the sub-
cutaneous space [29].
There is increasing evidence that MSCs that are located like
pericytes in perivascular niches of all blood vessels exert in these
microenvironments complex endothelial cell survival, immune-
protective and anti-inflammatory actions [32, 75, 76]. Chronic
hyperglycemic states result through various pathomechanisms in
microvascular and macrovascular damage, which may also impair
various functions of local MSCs and results in what has been
termed a “pericytopathy,” best described in the retinal microcircu-
lation [24, 77, 78].
Finally, the novel microenvironment that is created in NIs that
are composites of cultured ICs and equal numbers of MSCs, facili-
tates close range signaling by MSCs through the release of survival
factors,
cytokines,
growth
and
angiogenic
factors,
anti-
inflammatory miRNAs, the transfer of mitochondria and beneficial
exosomes into adjacent ICs [26, 37, 42, 68, 79–82]. In addition, it
would also enable cross talk between insulin producing and other
islet endocrine ICs. In contrast to technologies that use monohor-
monal, that is, insulin-only producing cells, NIs are expected to
contain all or most islet cell types, which may be advantageous.
When MSCs are grown in 3D culture, their anti-inflammatory
actions are potentiated, which may further enhance the therapeu-
tic efficacy of the NI technology in subjects with T1DM [83, 84]. It
is well established that MSCs respond to cues that arise from
stressed or damaged cells, resulting in improved survival of such
cells and repair through complex paracrine mechanisms, as has
been shown in the acutely injured kidney, the bone marrow, and
numerous other organs [68, 85]. Of further note is the fact that
after an NI is formed none of its cells proliferate in vitro or in vivo,
and MSCs do not undergo ectopic maldifferentiation or oncogenic
transformation. Finally, if indicated by an unanticipated complica-
tion, the omentum that harbors NIs can be removed, as we show
here, and standard insulin therapy can be resumed.
Although our NI technology appears to be an effective therapy
in the tested rodent models, we expect that further refinements
or modifications of this therapy will be needed.The i.v. administra-
tion of MSCs has been shown to have beneficial effects early in
the course of T1DM [23, 26, 55, 56], and may thus be useful as an
adjuvant therapy to NIs in subjects with a recent diagnosis of
T1DM. The i.p. administration of NIs may be more efficient when
delivered in hydrogel, Gelfoam or a thrombin clot, all of which can
improve their initial adhesion to the omentum. Should there be
evidence for premature rejection and loss of function of cNIs, a
short initial course with rapamycin has been reported by others to
improve islet survival and function [86]. If a potential recipient of
this therapy lacks or has a damaged omentum due to a prior

 intra-abdominal catastrophe, an intrahepatic transplant or a suita-
ble encapsulation device for i.p. delivery would be required.
Ongoing studies regarding our NI technology are focused
on analogous studies using human NIs in diabetic NOD/SCID
mice, as well as on the characterization of the NI-intrinsic
microcirculation post engraftment in the omentum, the long-
term distribution of MSCs within the NIs in vivo, their potential
differentiation into insulin-producing and vascular endothelial
cells, the redifferentiation of alpha and other endocrine cells in
vivo, in situ IDO (canine) and iNOS (murine) expression by
MSCs, and a detailed analysis of the long-term histology and
cell composition of functioning NIs.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the data from the present study demonstrate that
efficient generation of NIs from mouse, canine and human cells is
feasible and reproducible. The i.p. administration of NIs results in
their engraftment, redifferentiation and survival in the omentum
of spontaneously diabetic NOD mice, in SZT-diabetic mice, and
equally well in allogeneic, syngeneic and xenogeneic treatment
protocols. The fact that the therapy of diabetic NOD mice with
allogeneic NIs results in durable euglycemia, and absent anti-islet
cell and anti-MSC antibody production, up regulation of Tregs
within the NI-carrying omentum, demonstrates that the utilized
NIs provide both auto- and allo-immune isolation and importantly
facilitate redifferentiation of ICs into insulin producing cells. Fur-
thermore, since adequate capillary perfusion is essential for the
function of islets in vivo, it follows that the potent angiogenic
actions of MSCs induce the formation of a functioning capillary
system within the NIs that connects to the omental microvascula-
ture. Similarly, the successful glycemic control in STZ-diabetic
NOD/SCID mice with cNIs provides a strong scientific basis for our
Food and Drug Administration approved pilot studies in dogs with
T1DM. We expect to generate from these pilot studies additional
valuable information for potential future clinical trials.
Finally, the potential benefits NI technology could provide to
patients with T2DM lies in the fact that the route of insulin deliv-
ery would once again be physiological, and thus would be
expected to reduce insulin resistance, insulin-mediated lipogenesis
and potentially harmful exposure of peripheral tissues to high con-
centrations of subcutaneously administered insulin [44, 45].
Respective preclinical studies that investigate these possibilities
are currently underway.
