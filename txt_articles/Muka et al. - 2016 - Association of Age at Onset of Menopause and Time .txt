IMPORTANCE As many as 10% of women experience natural menopause by the age of 45
years. If confirmed, an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality
associated with premature and early-onset menopause could be an important factor affecting
risk of disease and mortality among middle-aged and older women.
OBJECTIVE To systematically review and meta-analyze studies evaluating the effect of age at
onset of menopause and duration since onset of menopause on intermediate CVD end
points, CVD outcomes, and all-cause mortality.
DATA SOURCES Medical databases (ie, Medline, EMBASE, and Web of Science) until March 2015.
STUDY SELECTION Studies (ie, observational cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional) that
assessed age at onset of menopause and/or time since onset of menopause as exposures as
well as risk of cardiovascular outcomes and intermediate CVD end points in perimenopausal,
menopausal, or postmenopausal women.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Studies were sought if they were observational cohort,
case-control, or cross-sectional studies; reported on age at onset of menopause and/or time
since onset of menopause as exposures; and assessed associations with risk of CVD-related
outcomes, all-cause mortality, or intermediate CVD end points. Data were extracted by
2 independent reviewers using a predesigned data collection form. The inverse-variance
weighted method was used to combine relative risks to produce a pooled relative risk using
random-effects models to allow for between-study heterogeneity.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cardiovascular disease outcomes (ie, composite CVD, fatal
and nonfatal coronary heart disease [CHD], and overall stroke and stroke mortality), CVD
mortality, all-cause mortality, and intermediate CVD end points.
RESULTS Of the initially identified references, 32 studies were selected that included 310 329
nonoverlapping women. Outcomes were compared between women who experienced
menopause younger than 45 years and women 45 years or older at onset; the relative risks
(95% CIs) were 1.50 (1.28-1.76) for overall CHD, 1.11 (1.03-1.20) for fatal CHD, 1.23 (0.98-1.53)
for overall stroke, 0.99 (0.92-1.07) for stroke mortality, 1.19 (1.08-1.31) for CVD mortality, and
1.12 (1.03-1.21) for all-cause mortality. Outcomes were also compared between women
between 50 and 54 years at onset of menopause and women younger than 50 years at onset;
there was a decreased risk of fatal CHD (relative risk, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80-0.96) and no effect
on stroke. Time since onset of menopause in relation to risk of developing intermediate
cardiovascular traits or CVD outcomes was reported in 4 observational studies with
inconsistent results.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The findings of this review indicate a higher risk of CHD, CVD
mortality, and overall mortality in women who experience premature or early-onset menopause.

R
isk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) increases with age,
and because women tend to live longer than men, the
absolute number of women living with and dying of
CVD is greater than the number of men.1 Therefore, early rec-
ognition of women at high risk for CVD and timely implemen-
tation of appropriate lifestyle or therapeutic interventions are
of tremendous public health importance.
Adverse changes in cardiovascular risk factors occur
around the menopausal transition,2-4 highlighting the need for
CVD risk assessment during this period and the introduction
of appropriate preventive or treatment modalities. While the
average age at onset of menopause is 51 years,5 this age varies
significantly among women aged 40 to 60 years. Women with
premature or early-onset menopause may not only be at risk
from a younger age but may also live more years of their lives
at an increased risk of adverse outcomes.6-8 This highlights the
need to evaluate the role of both age at and time since onset
of menopause as risk factors for CVD.
Age at onset of menopause may be a marker for not only
reproductive aging but also for general health and somatic
aging.9 Menopause has been proposed as the first step of a
causal pathway that, because of hormonal changes, eventu-
ally results in organ dysfunction.10 A hormonal change cited
as an important determinant in CVD development after meno-
pause is the decrease of endogenous estrogen synthesis.11 In
health vessels, estrogens are involved in the relaxation and ex-
pansion of blood vessels, helping to accommodate blood flow;
consequently,decreasedlevelsofestrogenresultinstifferblood
vessels.12 Furthermore, loss of the ovarian function through
menopause is associated with the activation of the renin-
angiotensin-aldosterone system, leading to downstream
endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and immune
dysfunction.13Theseprocessesareassociatedwithobesity,dia-
betes, and hypertension.13 Thus, premature and early-onset
menopause, which occur in women younger than 40 years
and aged 40 to 44 years, respectively, have been hypoth-
esized to be detrimental to cardiovascular health because of
the early cessation of the protective effect of endogenous es-
trogen. Therefore, a greater time since the onset of meno-
pause would result in a greater risk of intermediate and hard
CVD outcomes.
However, the extent to which age at onset of menopause
and time since onset of menopause is associated with the risk
of death and CVD and its intermediate risk factors remains un-
clear. A previous review14 investigated the association of age
atonsetofmenopausewithCVDbutdidnotincludeyearssince
onset and was based on few studies that lacked sufficient de-
tail (eg, associations of different age categories at onset of
menopause with CVD outcomes and the effect with CVD sub-
types or all-cause mortality). Therefore, a need exists for an
adequately powered, comprehensive assessment of onset of
menopause in association with subsequent adverse cardio-
vascular outcomes.
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of
available observational evidence to quantify the associations
of age at onset of menopause and time since onset of meno-
pause with (1) primarily clinical CVD outcomes and interme-
diate vascular traits and (2) all-cause mortality.
Methods
This review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA and
Meta-analysisofObservationalStudiesinEpidemiologyguide-
lines (eAppendix 1 and 2 in the Supplement). Two indepen-
dent reviewers, in duplication, sought studies published up
to March 2015 using Medline, EMBASE, and Web of Science
electronic databases. The computer-based searches com-
bined terms related to the exposure (eg, age at menopause and
duration from onset of menopause) and outcomes (eg, inflam-
mation,cardiovasculardisease,andmortality),withoutanylan-
guage restriction. Details on the search strategy are provided
in eAppendix 3 in the Supplement.
Study selection and eligibility criteria, data extraction and
quality assessment, and data synthesis and analysis are de-
scribed in detail in eAppendix 4 in the Supplement.
Results
Identification of Relevant Studies
The search strategy identified 9444 citations. Following initial
screening based on titles and abstracts, full texts of 73 articles
were evaluated further. Of these articles, 40 articles were ex-
cluded(Figure1).Theremaining33articles,basedon32unique
studies, met inclusion criteria and were included in the review.
General Characteristics of the Included Studies
eTables 1 and 2 in the Supplement summarize the key charac-
teristics of the included studies. All studies except one evalu-
ated risk in relation to the age at onset of menopause, with
4 additionally evaluating risk in relation to time since onset
of menopause. In aggregate, 342 284 women were included in
this review. However, not all studies provided relevant data
that could be meta-analyzed, and it was not possible to com-
bine any results related to time since onset of menopause, al-
though an analysis of age at onset of menopause was pos-
sible. Consequently, there were 297 496 participants in the
analysis of age at onset of menopause, which included 44 962
instances of CVD and/or deaths. Twenty-four studies were pro-
spectivecohortstudies,2werecase-controlstudies,and6were
Key Points
Question Are age at onset of menopause and years since onset
of menopause associated with cardiovascular outcomes,
intermediate vascular traits, and all-cause mortality?
Findings In this meta-analysis of 32 observational studies,
premature or early-onset menopause in women younger than
45 years were associated with an increased risk of coronary heart
disease and all-cause mortality. Time since onset of menopause in
relation to vascular outcomes was reported in 4 studies and
showed inconsistent results.
Meaning Our findings underscore a potential increased risk of
adverse cardiovascular outcomes in women who experience
premature or early-onset menopause.

cross-sectional studies. Overall, age at onset of menopause
in relation to risk of developing CVD intermediate end points
or outcomes or all-cause mortality was reported in 31 studies.
Among the prospective cohort and case-control studies,
14 studies were judged to be at low risk of bias, 10 were at
medium risk, and 2 were at high risk (eTables 1 and 2 in the
Supplement).

Because of differences in age categories, it was not pos-
sible to include one study in these meta-analyses. Lisabeth et
al22 evaluated the risk of ischemic stroke for women aged 42
to 54 years at onset of menopause compared with women with
premature menopause (younger than 42 years). They found a
decreased risk of ischemic stroke (RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.29-
0.89) for women aged 42 to 54 years at onset. An additional
lower risk was found for women 55 years and older at onset
(RR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.13-0.76).22
Association of Age at Menopause With All-Cause CVD, CHD,
and Stroke Mortality
The risk for different mortality outcomes was estimated for
women who experienced menopause younger than 45 years
relative to women 45 years or older and adjusted for several
established CVD risk factors and other potential confound-
ers.PooledresultsyieldedcombinedRRs(95%CIs)of1.12(1.03-
1.21) for all-cause mortality based on 109 898 participants and
31 427 all-cause deaths, 1.19 (1.08-1.31) for CVD mortality based
on 65 653 participants and 6979 CVD deaths, 1.11 (1.03-1.20)
for CHD mortality based on 118 150 participants and 8737 CHD
deaths, and 0.99 (0.92-1.07) for stroke mortality based on
143 833 participants and 6706 stroke deaths (Figure 3). There
was evidence of between-study heterogeneity for all-cause
mortalityanalysis(I2 = 63%;95%CI,20-83;P = .009),whereas
little evidence of between-study heterogeneity was found for
the other analyses (Figure 3). Corresponding pooled RRs (95%
CIs)forwomenaged45to49yearsatonsetofmenopausecom-
pared with women 50 years or older were 1.03 (1.00-1.05) for
all-cause mortality based on 90 691 participants and 28 188 all-
cause deaths, 0.99 (0.92-1.07) for CVD mortality based on
62 995 participants and 5786 CVD deaths, 0.98 (0.93 -1.04) for
CHD mortality based on 121 444 participants and 5954 CHD
deaths,and1.03(0.91-1.16)forstrokemortalitybasedon141 175
participants and 6320 stroke deaths (Figure 4; eFigures 1-4 in
the Supplement).
Comparing women who experienced menopause at 50 to
54 years with women younger than 50 years at onset yielded
pooled RRs (95% CIs) of 1.02 (0.89-1.15) for all-cause mortality
basedon7341participantsand1408all-causedeaths,0.96(0.74-

(eFigures 5-8 in the Supplement). There was little evidence of
between-studyheterogeneityintheseanalyses(Figure4;eFig-
ures 1-8 in the Supplement). Because of differences in age cat-
egories, it was not possible to include one study in the pooled
results.30Wuetal30reportedanincreasedriskofall-causemor-

Association of Age at Onset of Menopause
With Intermediate Cardiovascular Traits
Only 2 studies31,32 were identified that evaluated risk for
carotid atherosclerosis. Pooled RR (95% CI) for the risk of ca-
rotid atherosclerosis for 3388 participants was 0.74 (0.63-
0.87) when comparing women 50 years or older with women
younger than 50 years at onset of menopause (eFigure 9 in the
Supplement). However, there was evidence of between-
study heterogeneity (I2 = 69%; 95% CI, 0-93; P = .07). Three
studies30,33,34 could not be included in the meta-analysis of in-
termediate cardiovascular traits (eTable 3 in the Supple-
ment). These studies evaluated risk of diabetes relative to age
at onset of menopause. Two of the studies30,33 found no higher
risk for Chinese women who experienced menopause younger
or older than 50 years relative to women aged approximately
50 years at onset. The same findings were observed in a study
of European women34 in which women younger than 45 years
at onset of menopause, aged 45 to 49 years at onset, and older
than 55 years at onset were not at greater risk for diabetes than
women aged 50 to 54 years at onset.
Association of Years Since Onset of Menopause With CVD
Outcomes and Intermediate Cardiovascular Traits
Time since onset of menopause in relation to risk of develop-
ing intermediate cardiovascular traits or CVD outcomes
was reported in 4 observational studies.32,35-37 Of these,
2 studies35,36 reported risk of overall CVD outcomes, and 3
studies32,36,37 estimated risk of intermediate cardiovascular
traits.Theageatbaselinerangedfrom40to81years.Twostud-
ies, conducted in Italy35 and China,36 evaluated the risk of CVD
outcomes, including CHD, stroke, and composite CVD out-
comes (eTable 4 in the Supplement), and 3 studies assessed
the risk of intermediate cardiovascular traits, including meta-
bolic syndrome, obesity or high body mass index, and hyper-
tension (eTable 5 in the Supplement) in Korean,37 Chinese,36
and German32 populations. Owing to a substantial heteroge-
neity in the comparison groups used across these studies, no
quantitativesynthesiscouldbeperformed.Therefore,thefind-
ings of these studies were only qualitatively reviewed. In a Chi-
nese population study,13 women 2 to 6 years postmenopause
were at a greater risk of CVD than women less than 1 year post-
menopause, with evidence of an increased risk after 6 years.
In the same study, there was also evidence of a greater risk of
CHD and stroke for women more than 1 year postmenopause.13
However, these findings were in contrast to those in an Ital-
ian population study,14 which found no increased risk of myo-
cardialinfarctioninpostmenopausalwomenlessthan10years,
10 to 20 years, or more than 20 years postmenopause com-
paredwithpre-orperimenopausalwomen.Stöckletal32found
noassociationbetweentimesinceonsetofmenopauseandthe
presence of carotid atherosclerosis. However, time since on-
set of menopause was dichotomized into broad groups, com-
paring women less than 15 years postmenopause with women
more than 15 years postmenopause.
Relativetopremenopausalwomen,Koreanwomenwereat
greater risk of metabolic syndrome after menopause, and this
risk increased with time since onset of menopause, with the
greatest risk found in women between 10 and 14 years after
menopause.22 Within the same population, there was evi-
denceofincreasedriskofhypertension,abdominalobesity,and
high glucose levels in postmenopausal women; however, risk
did not vary with duration since onset of menopause.22 Con-
versely, no increased risk of obesity, hypertension, or diabetes

when studies were grouped by location and type of meno-
pause as well as by adjustment for socioeconomic status or
hormone replacement therapy (Table). Under visual exami-
nation, Begg funnel plots for those analyses that included a
minimum of 5 studies were mostly symmetrical (eFigure 10
in the Supplement), with possible exception of studies
evaluating overall CHD risk and CHD mortality risk in
women with premature or early-onset menopause. How-
ever, there was no statistical evidence of publication bias
based on the Egger test, which was nonsignificant (P > .05)
for all analyses that involved 5 or more studies.
Discussion
Overall, we found that women who experienced premature or
early-onset menopause appeared to have a greater risk of CHD,
CVD mortality, and all-cause mortality but no association with
stroke risk. By contrast, an age of 45 to 49 years at onset of
menopause compared with 50 years or older at onset had no
apparent association with adverse outcomes except for an in-
creasedriskofcarotidatherosclerosis.Onlyafewstudiesevalu-
ating risk in relation to time since onset of menopause could
be found, reporting conflicting results.
Interpretation of Findings
The current study supports previous findings that there is an
increased risk of CVD with premature or early-onset meno-
pause, specifically identifying a greater risk of CHD and
potentially with carotid atherosclerosis. These findings gen-
erally concur with and further extend a previous review,14
which reported an increased risk of CVD for women 50 years
or younger at onset of menopause compared with women 51
years or older at onset. However, the findings of the previous
review were only based on 7 prospective cohort studies, and
the authors were not able to compare other age categories
with the risk of CVD. In addition, our study examined the
association between age at onset of menopause with all-
cause mortality and CVD subtypes, providing a more
detailed assessment of the nature and magnitude of the
association between menopause and risk of disease and
mortality in women. Despite the 12 108 participants
included, our finding on an association between premature
or early-onset menopause with carotid atherosclerosis needs
to be interpreted with some caution; to our knowledge, a
relatively small number of studies are currently available,
some of which have between-study heterogeneity.
Theassociationbetweenprematureandearly-onsetmeno-
pause and CHD risk may have several mechanistic interpreta-
tions. Early loss of the ovarian function through menopause
may lead to long-term activation of the renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system, leading to endothelial dysfunction, in-
flammation, and immune dysfunction and therefore causing
vascular damage.13,38 This process may be partially mediated
via the transmembrane G protein-coupled estrogen receptor.13
Additionally,menopausemarksthestartofabiologicalmecha-
nism, led by hormonal changes, that causes tissue damage and
organ dysfunction.10 The multiorgan effect of menopause pro-
posed by this theory, and supported by findings of an in-
creased risk of depression, dementia, and osteoporosis,39-41
seems to be consistent with the increased risk of all-cause mor-
tality found in the current analysis.
Alternatively, there may be shared risk factors—either
genetic or environmental—that result in premature or

early-onset menopause and increase the risk of adverse health
outcomes.10 In this case, early menopause could be consid-
ered only as a marker of risk. In support of a shared genetic
basis, a large-scale genome-wide association study42 of age
at onset of menopause identified a number of loci, including
the ones relevant to CVD, that were involved in inflammatory
response, oxidative stress, and genome stability. Speculative
environmental factors could include obstetric history, such as
parity or having a past stillbirth. However, these explana-
tions are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and a combina-
tion of these mechanisms may be responsible for the ob-
served increase in CVD and all-cause mortality risk.
Strengths and Limitations
To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive quantita-
tive review of observational evidence that assessed both the
associations of age at onset of menopause and time since on-
set of menopause with clinical CVD outcomes, intermediate
cardiovascular traits, and all-cause mortality. Our analyses in-
cluded more than 300 000 women and evaluated the risk of
a wide range of outcomes in relation to various age groups.
However, strengths and limitations in the current study merit
careful consideration. First, all systematic reviews are prone
toreportingbias,owingtothepossibilitythatstudieswithmore
extreme results are more likely to be published. Nonetheless,
as demonstrated by Egger test estimates, there was little evi-
dence of publication bias in the current analyses. Addition-
ally, all meta-analyses are limited by the quality of the indi-
vidual published studies. However, the majority of studies
included in the current analyses were of high quality, with a
low risk of bias.
To allow for a uniform analysis, it was necessary to com-
bine some overlapping age groups for some studies (eg,
studies that reported estimates for women who experienced
menopause at 50 to 54 years and those that reported data for
women older than 50 years). This might have introduced
some heterogeneity into the analyses. Additionally, owing to
differential categorization of age at onset of menopause in
various studies and the few studies evaluating a particular
outcome (eg, carotid atherosclerosis), some of our analysis
are based on a small number of studies. Therefore, these
results need to be interpreted with caution, particularly
those that yielded moderate between-study heterogeneity
estimates. Furthermore, the lack of studies evaluating risk in
relation to time since onset of menopause limited us from
performing any meaningful quantitative synthesis using this
exposure.
Most studies that were identified adjusted for a range of
relevant confounders, although one study was entirely
unadjusted43 and 3 were only adjusted for age.16,31,44 Many
studies did not examine the effect of important determinants
of age at onset of menopause, such as socioeconomic factors,
number of births, and lifestyle factors (eg, smoking status, al-
cohol intake, and level of physical activity). Therefore, the risk
of residual confounding cannot be entirely ruled out. A spe-
cificconcernisconfoundingfromhormonetherapyuse,which
particularly may vary depending on the age at onset of meno-
pause. Women who experience menopause at a younger age
may be more likely to start hormone therapy than women who
reachmenopauseintheir50s.Consequently,hormonetherapy
use may confound the association between age at meno-
pause and CVD risk. Indeed, hormone therapy was only ad-
justed for in a minority of identified studies.18,33,35,45,46 More-
over, because the number of available studies in some of our
analyses was small, it precluded our ability to comprehen-
sively assess the effect of type of menopause in our results.
However, the complex interplay between exogenous hor-
mones and CVD risk is not fully understood, and the results
regarding hormone replacement therapy and CVD risk are
conflicting.47-49
Clinical and Scientific Implications
This review underscores a potential increased risk of adverse
cardiovascular outcomes in women who experience prema-
ture or early-onset menopause, which may have important
clinical and public health implications. This study also iden-
tified a number of gaps in the literature concerning the asso-
ciations between time since onset of menopause, age at on-
set of menopause, and intermediate cardiovascular traits and
CVD outcomes. To our knowledge, few studies focused on in-
termediate cardiovascular end points, leading to conflicting
results and impeding meaningful interpretation. These inter-
mediate factors are of potential importance in the interpreta-
tion of the observed higher cardiovascular risk; further re-
search focusing on intermediate cardiovascular traits is
required. Finally, other areas of interest are the association be-
tweenageatonsetofmenopauseandtimesinceonsetofmeno-
pause and whether there are common determinants for pre-
mature menopause and CVD. The observed link between
premature or early menopause and CVD risk may be modi-
fied by differing times since the onset of menopause. The
higher CHD risk may be driven in part by a longer time since
the onset of menopause in women with premature or early-
onset menopause. Alternatively, the increased RR found with
early-onset menopause may be present only in the first years
after menopause, ameliorating over time. To our knowledge,
the known risk factors for premature menopause include
genetics,41 reproductive factors (eg, parity and age at
menarche),18 and lifestyle factors (eg, smoking status, alco-
hol intake, and body mass index).18,50 However, the role of
these factors in mediating the association between an early on-
set of menopause and CVD remains unclear and therefore
warrants further research.
Conclusions
The findings of this review indicate a higher risk of CHD, car-
diovascular mortality, and overall mortality in women who ex-
perience premature or early-onset menopause when younger
than 45 years. However, this review also highlights impor-
tant gaps in the existing literature and calls for further re-
search to reliably establish whether cardiovascular risk var-
ies in relation to the time since onset of menopause and the
mechanisms leading early menopause to cardiovascular out-
comes and mortality.

Reproductive Health as a Marker of Subsequent
Cardiovascular Disease
The Role of Estrogen
JoAnn E. Manson, MD, DrPH; Teresa K. Woodruff, PhD
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) kills 1 in 3 women worldwide,1
and the risk of CVD increases markedly after the cessation of
ovarian function at menopause.2 Although the dramatic
decline in estrogen levels following menopause has been
implicated in the loss of
cardioprotection in women,
the association between the
decline in ovarian function
and vascular disease may
be even more complex.2 The
menopausal transition is
associated with significant
changes in the vascular sys-
tem, distribution of body fat, blood pressure, and blood lipid
levels,3 all of which increase the risk of CVD. However, the
possibility of shared risk factors, including genetic, lifestyle,
and environmental, for both early menopause and elevated
CVD risk warrants consideration. Key questions are whether
early cessation of reproductive function etiologically
increases risk of CVD or whether latent cardiovascular dis-
ease causes reproductive aging and accelerates the onset of
menopause (or both).
Menopause occurs at an average age of 51 years in West-
ernpopulations,buttherangeofageatonsetiswide,withmost
women experiencing menopause between ages 40 and 60
years.3,4 Approximately 10% of women experience meno-
pause younger than 45 years and consequently have a shorter
total duration of premenopausal estrogen exposure than
women with later-onset menopause. As shown in the meta-
analysisinthisissueofJAMACardiologybyMukaetal,5women
with early menopause have an increased risk of overall coro-
nary heart disease, fatal coronary heart disease, CVD mortal-
ity, and all-cause mortality. However, most studies are un-
able to assess directionality of the association between early
naturalmenopauseandCVDrisk.Thepotentialforpre-orperi-
menopausal cardiovascular risk factor status to predict early
menopause was addressed in the Framingham Heart Study,6
which found that increases in cholesterol, systolic and dia-
stolic blood pressures, and other vascular risk factors prior to
menopause were each associated with future menopause at a
significantly younger age, even after adjusting for smoking.
Such data provide intriguing support for the hypothesis that
cardiovascular health may contribute to the timing of meno-
pause but do not preclude a bidirectional association. Shared
risk factors, such as smoking, which has been associated with
both early menopause and increased CVD risk, other risk fac-
tors, and shared gene variants for both outcomes may also be
contributory.3,4
An additional line of evidence for an adverse effect of early
loss of ovarian hormones on vascular outcomes derives from
research on women with early surgical menopause and bilat-
eral oophorectomy. Oophorectomy before menopause leads
to an abrupt reduction in endogenous estrogen and androgen
production.3,4 In a meta-analysis of observational studies,7
early bilateral oophorectomy was associated with more than
double the risk of CVD (relative risk, 2.62; 95% CI, 2.05-3.35).
