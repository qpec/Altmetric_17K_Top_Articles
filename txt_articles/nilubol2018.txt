Abstract
Background: The advantages of nanomedicines include preferential delivery of the payload directly to tumor tissues.
CYT-21625 is the novel, first-in-class gold nanomedicine designed to target tumor vasculature and cancer cells by specifically
delivering recombinant human tumor necrosis factor alpha (rhTNF) and a paclitaxel prodrug.
Methods: We analyzed TNF receptor expression in publicly available gene expression profiling data and in thyroid
tissue samples. Mice with metastatic FTC-133 and 8505C xenografts and the MEN1 conditional knock-out mice were
treated weekly with CYT-21625 and gold nanoparticles with rhTNF only (CYT-6091); controls included mice treated with
either paclitaxel or saline. In vivo luciferase activity was used to assess the effects on tumor growth. Computed
tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and 18F-Fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography were used to study
tumor selectivity in mice with insulin-secreting pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs). All statistical tests were
two-sided.
Results: Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) expressed statistically significantly higher levels of TNF receptor superfamily 1A and
1B messenger RNA (n ¼ 11) and protein (n ¼ 6) than control samples (n ¼ 45 and 13, respectively). Mice (n ¼ 5–7 per group)
with metastatic ATC (P < .009) and FTC-133 xenografts (P ¼ .03 at week 3, but not statistically significant in week 4 owing to
reduced sample size from death in non-CYT-21625 groups) treated with CYT-21625 had a statistically significantly lower tu-
mor burden. Treatment with CYT-21625 resulted in loss of CD34 expression in intratumoral vasculature, decreased proliferat-
ing cell nuclear antigen, and increased cleaved caspase-3. Intratumoral vascular leakage occurred only in mice with PNET
and ATC treated with CYT-6091 and CYT-21625. CYT-6091 and CYT-21625 preferentially deposited in PNETs and statistically
significantly decreased serum insulin levels (n ¼ 3 per group, P < .001). There were no toxicities observed in mice treated with
CYT-21625.
Conclusions: CYT-21625 is effective in mice with PNETs and metastatic human thyroid cancer with no toxicities. Thus,
CYT-21625 should be studied in patients with advanced PNETs and thyroid cancer.
The current treatment options for patients with dedifferenti-
ated thyroid cancer refractory to radioactive iodine treatment
include multikinase inhibitors such as sorafenib and lenvatinib
(1,2). However, serious adverse events requiring either a dose re-
duction or a treatment interruption because of toxicities occur
in 37% of patients treated with sorafenib and in 75% of patients

 treated with
lenvatinib
(1,2). Lastly, no durable
complete
responses have been observed with sorafenib and lenvatinib
therapy in radioiodine-negative, differentiated, or poorly differ-
entiated thyroid cancer.
Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is a rare and lethal subtype
of thyroid cancer, accounting for less than 2% of all thyroid can-
cers but approximately one-third of thyroid cancer–specific
deaths (3). The median survival rate of patients with ATC is less
than six months, with 90% of patients presenting with unresect-
able and metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis (4,5).
Currently, there is no effective therapy for ATC, and patient sur-
vival has not improved in more than six decades (5,6). Thus, it is
critically important to identify new treatment that inhibits dis-
ease progression or metastasis and improves the survival rate
of patients with ATC.
The
annual
incidence
of
pancreatic
neuroendocrine
tumors (PNETs) is continuously increasing within the United
States and is estimated to be three to five cases per 100 000
inhabitants (7–9). Nonfunctioning PNETs account for more
than 85% of all neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas and
present with distant metastases in up to 60% of cases (10–
12). The current approved systemic therapy for patients with
advanced PNETs includes somatostatin analogs and targeted
therapy such as sunitinib and everolimus. However, a dura-
ble partial is uncommon with these treatments. Sunitinib
and everolimus have clinically significant toxicity, and dose
reduction or treatment interruption is commonly required
(13,14).
A major limitation to systemically delivered cancer thera-
pies is dose-limiting toxicity due to off-target activity resulting
in injury to normal cells and tissues. Because solid tumors
have highly permeable vasculature and high cell density but
low lymphatic drainage, the tumor interstitial fluid pressure
(IFP) is higher than surrounding normal tissue. The elevated
IFP results in a drop of convection between the intra- and
extravascular spaces, thus limiting drug distribution into the
tumor microenvironment and markedly reducing its efficacy
(15). Current anticancer drugs do not address this limitation.
Hypervascularity is common in endocrine cancers such as thy-
roid cancer and PNETs (16,17). Thus, these two cancers are
suitable models to demonstrate the efficacy of nanomedicine
that disrupts tumor blood vessels to enhance the delivery of
cytotoxic agents. Nanomedicines offer the promise of over-
coming this limitation by allowing for the design of agents that
can selectively deliver their payload to tumor tissues (18). The
novel, first-in-class nanomedicine CYT-21625 comprises two
distinct antitumor agents, recombinant human tumor necrosis
factor alpha (rhTNF) and a paclitaxel prodrug analog (JZ-
21625), bound to gold particles. CYT-21625 selectively targets
solid tumors passively by the enhanced permeability and re-
tention (EPR) effect and actively by rhTNF binding to its recep-
tors on the tumor neovasculature and induces apoptosis of
vascular endothelium, destroying tumor blood vessels. CYT-
21625 in the tumor releases native paclitaxel that exerts a di-
rect antitumor effect. Because the release of the paclitaxel ana-
log on CYT-21625 requires elevated levels of glutathione (GSH)
in the tumor microenvironment (19), such a condition cannot
be recapitulated in vitro. Thus, the aims of this study were to
determine the in vivo antitumor activity of CYT-21625 in trans-
genic and metastatic models of endocrine cancers and to eval-
uate the mechanism of action of CYT-21625 treatment in these
models.
Methods
CYT-6091 and CYT-21625
CYT-6091 and the colloidal gold nanoparticles used for CYT-
21625 production were prepared per a previously published pro-
tocol (20). We described the production of CYT-21625 and dos-
ages in the Supplementary Materials (available online).
Cell Lines
The 8505C and FTC-133 thyroid cancer cell lines do not express
thyroglobulin, thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor, thyroid
peroxidase, or sodium-iodine symporter genes consistent with
dedifferentiated thyroid cancer (21). These cell lines were au-
thenticated by short tandem repeat. Both the 8505C and FTC-
133 cells were transfected with a linearized pGL4.51[luc2/CMV/
Neo] vector (Promega, Madison, WI) encoding the luciferase re-
porter gene luc2 (Photinus pyralis) as previously described (22).
The sources, characteristics, and culture conditions of these cell
lines are described in the Supplementary Materials (available
online).
Gene Expression Profiling of Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer
We analyzed publicly available, genome-wide expression data
(GSE33630, Gene Expression Omibus, The National Cancer for
Biotechnology Information [23]) to study the messenger RNA ex-
pression of TNF receptors (TNFRSF1A and TNFRSF1B) in ATC
samples compared with normal thyroid tissue. The Affymetrix
U133 Plus 2.0 array was used to profile the gene expression of 11
ATCs, 49 papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs), and 45 normal
thyroid samples (24).
Study Approval
The
Animal
Care
and
Use
Committee
(National
Cancer
Institute/National Institutes of Health) approved the thyroid
cancer cell xenograft animal study protocol. All animal experi-
ments involving MEN-1 conditional knock-out mice were con-
ducted with approval from the Animal Ethical and Welfare
Committee of Albert Einstein College of Medicine, based on pro-
cedures outlined in the National Institutes of Health Guideline
for the Care and Use of Animals.
In Vivo Metastatic Poorly Differentiated and Anaplastic
Thyroid Cancer Mouse Models
Luc2 reporter cells from a 70%–80% confluent monolayer culture
were trypsinized and suspended in DMEM. Suspensions of 1 �
105 8505C-Luc2 cells and 4 � 105 FTC-133-Luc2 cells in 0.2 mL of
DMEM were injected intravenously via tail vein into eight-week-
old to three-month-old NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ mice. We
previously described the cell numbers required for each cell line
to engraft with optimal survival (22). Mice were maintained un-
der normal immunodeficient mouse care conditions and moni-
tored daily to assess their health status. Mice were randomly
assigned into treatment and control groups (n ¼ 23 in the 8505C
group, n ¼ 7 in the vehicle control group, n ¼ 6 in the CYT-6091
group, n ¼ 5 in the paclitaxel and CYT-21625 groups, and n ¼ 20
in the FTC-133 group; n ¼ 5 per group). Treatment with CYT-
21625 and controls started one week after implantation. We per-
formed a bioluminescence imaging study weekly. To assess

 vascular leakage, six mice with 8505C xenografts received one
dose of CYT-21625 (n ¼ 2), CYT-6091 (n ¼ 2), paclitaxel (n ¼ 1),
and vehicle control (n ¼ 1), then were euthanized 24 hours after
treatments. The imaging, anesthetic, and euthanization techni-
ques are described in the Supplementary Materials (available
online).
The MEN1 Conditional Knock-out Model With Pancreatic
Neuroendocrine Tumors
Because insulinoma is the most common functioning PNET and
the most common somatic mutation in PNETs is MEN1 muta-
tions (25), we selected a previously published MEN1 conditional
knock-out mouse model. These mice developed insulinomas
with markedly elevated serum insulin and abnormal vascula-
ture with increased vascular endothelial growth factor expres-
sion (26). Twelve 12-month-old mice carrying the MEN1 allele
flanked by loxP sites with Cre recombinase under the control of
the pancreas-specific transcription factor Pdx1 promoter (Pdx1-
Cre:Men1 floxed/floxed) were used in this study. The mice were
assigned to four groups treated with either CYT-6091 (n ¼ 3),
CYT-21625 (n ¼ 3), paclitaxel (n ¼ 3), or vehicle control (n ¼ 3),
respectively. The duration of the treatments was two weeks.
The
therapeutic
responses
to
CYT-21625,
CYT-6091,
and
paclitaxel were evaluated by measuring serum insulin levels.
The in vivo biodistribution and vascular effects were monitored
by
computed
tomography/positron
emission
tomography
(CT/PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), respectively,
as described in the Supplementary Materials (available online).
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for Insulin Level
Measurement
The mice underwent a 24-hour fast prior to collection of whole
blood via a retro-orbital bleeding technique, weekly. Serum in-
sulin was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA)
with
the
Ultrasensitive
Mouse
Insulin
ELISA
kit
(Mercodia, Inc.; Uppsala, Sweden) according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions.
Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence
Formalin-fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin and cut into
5 lm–thick sections for hematoxylin and eosin staining and
immunostaining. To assess the protein expression of TNFRSF1A
in human samples, we used a thyroid tissue microarray con-
taining six cases of each normal thyroid tissue, follicular ade-
noma, PTC, FTC, and ATC (TH641, US Biomax, Inc., Rockville,
MD). Three additional PTC samples (one with adjacent normal
thyroid tissue) were used. Each case had duplicate samples. To
assess TNFRSF1A expression in PNETs, we used 12 PNET sam-
ples from six patients with MEN1 syndrome (World Health
Organization [WHO] grade 1 in 3 samples and grade 2 in 3 sam-
ples) and six patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease (WHO
grade 1 in 2 samples and grade 2 in 4 samples). The methods
used in immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence are
described in the Supplementary Materials (available online).
Statistical Analysis
We analyzed the gene expression profiling data (GSE33630) us-
ing embedded interactive statistical software (GEO2R). The P
values
were
adjusted
for
false
discovery
rate
using
the
Benjamini and Hochberg method (27). The fold change between
groups was presented in a log2 scale. The Student t test was
used to assess the difference in luciferase activity in mice
treated with CYT-21625 and control groups (28). Overall survival
(OS) was calculated in days from the implantation to the date of
death. The Kaplan-Meier estimator (29) with log-rank (Mantel-
Cox) (30) test was used to compare OS between groups. We used
analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc tests to compare
the immunohistochemistry scores and the weight of mice be-
tween groups. We used luciferase activity and OS as the primary
outcome measures in this study. Statistical analyses were per-
formed using SPSS version 21.0 for Windows (SPSS, Inc.,
Chicago,
IL).
GraphPad
Prism
6,
version
6.01
(GraphPad
Software, La Jolla, CA), was used to create graphs demonstrating
in vivo luciferase activity.
The data from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI-DCE) were extracted using the Medical
Image Processing, Analysis, and Visualization (MIPAV) program
(National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) created on Perl 5
(version 5). We used R (version 3.2.2) (31) to remove the outliers
due to noise and motion, to draw the best-fit line, and to calcu-
late area under the curve (AUC). The Kaplan-Meier estimator
(29) with log-rank (Mantel-Cox) (30) test was used to compare
OS between groups. Insulin serum is represented as the mean 6
standard deviation. The difference between means was ana-
lyzed with either the two-tailed independent Student t test for
two-group analysis, or by one-way ANOVA for analyses of three
or more groups. If interactions were found, pair-wise compari-
sons between group levels were calculated with Bonferroni cor-
rection for multiple testing. A two-tailed P value of less than .05
was considered statistically significant.
Results
Expressions of Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptors in
Differentiated Thyroid Cancer, Anaplastic Thyroid
Cancer, and Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors
Because the action of rhTNF is mediated through binding its
receptors, we first evaluated TNF receptor expression in human
cancer samples. The tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily
1A (TNFRSF1A) and 1B (TNFRSF1B) mRNA expressions in ATC
(n ¼ 11) were statistically significantly higher than in normal
thyroid tissue (n ¼ 45) with an adjusted P value of less than .001
and fold change of 1.44 for TNFRSF1A, and an adjusted P value of
less than .001 and fold change of 2.46 for TNFRSF1B (Figure 1A).
Immunohistochemistry showed no TNFRSF1A expression in
normal and benign thyroid tissue, except for one sample of
follicular adenoma that had mild to moderate TNFRSF1A ex-
pression in intratumoral blood vessels (n ¼ 13). Eight of 15 dif-
ferentiated thyroid cancer (PTC and FTC) samples were positive
for
TNFRSF1A
expression
in
intratumoral
blood
vessels
(Figure 1, B and C). All six ATC samples had positive TNFRSF1A
protein expression in intratumoral blood vessels and/or tumor
cell cytoplasms (Figure 1D). ATC had a statistically significantly
higher immunohistochemistry score of TNFRSF1A expression
compared with differentiated thyroid cancer samples (papillary
thyroid
cancer
[PTC]
and
follicular
thyroid
cancer
[FTC],
P < .001) and normal and benign thyroid samples (P < .001)
(Figure 1E). Metastatic human ATC (8505C) and PDTC (FTC-133)
lung xenografts expressed TNFRSF1A while myocardium adja-
cent to the tumors did not (Figure 1F). Of 12 primary PNET

 samples, eight expressed TNFRSF1A in intratumoral blood ves-
sels, including one sample with cytoplasmic TNFRSF1A expres-
sion. Adjacent normal pancreas and islet cells (n ¼ 1) did not
express TNFRSF1A (Figure 1G).
The Effects of CYT-21625 in Mice With Metastatic
Human Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer and Follicular
Thyroid Cancer Xenografts
Mice with metastatic human ATC xenografts (8505C cell line)
treated with CYT-21625 for three weeks (once-a-week dosing)
had statistically significantly less tumor burden, as demon-
strated by a statistically significantly lower level of luciferase
activity (vehicle vs CYT-21625: P ¼ .03 week 2 and P ¼ .009 week
3, and CYT-6091 vs CYT-21625: P ¼ .007 week 2 and P ¼ .01 week
3). There was no difference in luciferase activity between the ve-
hicle control group and the CYT-6091-treated group (P ¼ .47
week 2 and P ¼ .31 week 3) (Figure 2A). All mice were euthanized
after three weeks of treatments at the same time for humane
end points because mice in vehicle control and CYT-6091 were
in distress.
Next, we studied the effect of CYT-21625 in mice with meta-
static human FTC xenografts (FTC-133). Although the luciferase
activity in the CYT-21625 group was statistically significantly
lower than that of other groups after three weeks of treatments
(P ¼ .03) and lower than the baseline activity in all mice treated
with CYT-21625 for four weeks, the difference between groups
after four weeks of treatments did not reach statistical signifi-
cance (vehicle vs CYT-21625: P ¼ .06, paclitaxel vs CYT-21625:
P ¼ .35, CYT-6091 vs CYT-21625: P ¼ .33) because of reduced
sample size, as three mice in the non-CYT-21625 group died af-
ter week 3 treatment (Figure 2B). Mice treated with CYT-21625
had statistically significantly longer overall survival (OS) than
mice in the vehicle control and paclitaxel groups (mean OS ¼
52.2 days, 95% confidence interval [CI] ¼ 49.0 to 55.3 days, vs
mean OS ¼ 41.7 days, 95% CI ¼ 37.4 to 46.0 days, P ¼ .01). There
was no statistically significant difference in OS between mice in
the CYT-21625 group and those in CYT-6091 group (mean OS ¼
52.2 days, 95% CI ¼ 49 to 55.3 days, vs mean OS ¼ 46.8 days,
95% CI ¼ 39 to 54.6 days, P ¼ .32) (Figure 2B).
There was no difference in weight between treatment
groups (week 3 P ¼ .67, week 4 P ¼ .33). We observed asymptom-
atic mucosal and skin hyperpigmentation due to gold particle
deposition in all mice treated with CYT-21625 (data not shown).
The Effects of CYT-21625 on Vascular Endothelium,
Vascular Permeability, and Thyroid Cancer Cells in
Metastatic Human Thyroid Cancer Xenografts
Human ATC xenografts weakly expressed TNFRSF1A in the
cytoplasm but not in mouse vascular endothelium. Because
CYT-21625 is thought to selectively target solid tumor neovas-
culature passively by the EPR effect and actively by rhTNF, we
evaluated the disruption of intratumoral vascular endothelium
in human ATC xenografts from the lungs by CD34 immunohis-
tochemistry. Compared with the vehicle control, paclitaxel, and
CYT-6091 groups, intratumoral vascular endothelium of human
ATC xenografts in mice treated with CYT-21625 had no CD34
expression, consistent with endothelial damage (Figure 3A).
However, there was no histologic evidence of normal organ
(heart, liver, and kidneys) injuries or vascular endothelial dam-
age in mice treated with CYT-21625 as demonstrated by
retained CD34 endothelial cell expression (Figure 3, B and C).
There was some deposit of gold nanoparticles, predominantly
in the liver, without evidence of inflammation or any other
morphologic and histologic changes. We evaluated the extrava-
sation of fibrinogen because of intratumoral vascular leakage by
immunofluorescence. Twenty-four hours following treatment,
the extravasation of fibrinogen in tumor tissue was more pro-
nounced in mice treated with CYT-6091 and CYT-21625 com-
pared with the vehicle control and paclitaxel groups (Figure 3D).
No extravasation of fibrinogen was observed in normal organs
of mice treated with CYT-6091 and CYT-21625 (Figure 3E). Next,
we assessed the proliferative index in the tumors treated with
CYT-21625. To assess the effect of CYT-21625 on cancer cell pro-
liferation,
we
evaluated
proliferating
cell
nuclear
antigen
(PCNA) in xenografts as it is a nuclear protein that acts as a
homotrimer and helps increase the processivity of leading
strand synthesis during DNA replication. Human ATC and FTC-
133 xenografts from the lungs of mice treated with CYT-21625
had statistically significantly decreased protein expression of
PCNA compared with those of mice in other treatment groups
(CYT-21625 vs controls, P < .001; CYT-21625 vs CYT-6091, P <
.001) (Figure 3F). In addition, we observed statistically signifi-
cantly increased cleaved caspase-3 protein expression in ATC
and FTC-133 xenografts from the lungs of mice treated with
CYT-21625 compared with other groups (CYT-21625 vs controls,
P < .001; CYT-21625 vs CYT-6091, P < .001) (Figure 3G).
Tumor Selectivity of CYT-21625 in Mice With PNET
We next evaluated whether CYT-21625 selectively traffics to tu-
mor sites using a transgenic model of PNETs. Mice 18F-FDG PET
CT imaging revealed accumulation of gold nanoparticles in the
PNET region 24 hours after administration of CYT-6091 and
CYT-21625, which was not visualized in control mice injected
with paclitaxel or vehicle control. The gold particle deposits in
the area of 18F-FDG PET avidity are consistent with a selective
trafficking of CYT-6091 and CYT-21625 to PNET (Figure 4).
The Effects of CYT-21625 on Tumor Vasculature in
Transgenic Mouse Model of PNETs
To further evaluate whether CYT-21625 induces tumor vascular
disruption and leakage in vivo, tumor vascular perfusion was
measured in the transgenic PNET model using area under the
curve (AUC) from DCE-MRI. The AUCs in PNETs were increased
in CYT-21625- and CYT-6019-treated mice compared with mice
receiving paclitaxel and vehicle control (Figure 5), consistent
with the MRI contrast extravasation. The DAUC (between mean
AUC of post-treatment and mean AUC of pretreatment) with
CYT-21625 (25 187.85) and CYT-6091 (19 941.19) was increased
compared with the paclitaxel (6862.80) and vehicle control
(6351.82) in PNETs (Supplementary Table 1, available online). In
contrast, a minimal effect was observed in muscle tissue after
any treatments in all groups (Supplementary Table 1, available
online). These results underscore the selective effects in the tu-
mor
tissue
following
administration
of
the
targeted
nanomedicine.
The Effect of CYT-21625 on Serum Insulin in Mice With
Insulinomas
We evaluated the antitumor activity of CYT-21625 in MEN1 KO
mice with insulinomas by measuring the serum level of insulin,
which we have previously validated as a tumor biomarker and

 surrogate for tumor response to therapy (26,32).. Baseline serum
insulin levels in all four groups (CYT-21625, CYT-6091, paclitaxel,
and vehicle control) were measured, with no statistically signifi-
cant difference: 3.617 lg/L 6 0.061, 3.580 lg/L 6 0.160, 3.580 lg/L 6
0.105, and 3.543 lg/L 6 0.078, respectively (P ¼ .87). By day 7 after
administration, mice treated with CYT-21625 had statistically sig-
nificant lower serum insulin levels (1.927 6 0.231 lg/L) than those
treated with CYT-6091 (3.010 6 0.130 lg/L, P ¼ .001), paclitaxel
(2.943 6 0.239 lg/L, P ¼ .001), and vehicle control (3.693 6 0.035 lg/
L, P < .001). Furthermore, we observed that mice receiving CYT-
21625 had the largest decrease in their serum insulin levels when
compared with those receiving treatment with either CYT-6091 or
paclitaxel at seven and 14 days post-treatment (P < .001) (Figure 6).
After 28 days of treatment, all three mice treated with CYT-21625
survived, and their insulin levels continued to decrease to 0.59 lg/
L 6 0.151. Two mice in CYT-6091 and one each in the paclitaxel-
and vehicle-treated groups survived on day 28. However, the insu-
lin levels in mice treated with vehicle control, paclitaxel, and CYT-
6091 were all higher than 3 lg/L.
Discussion
CYT-21625 is the first-in-class nanomedicine that specifically
addresses the high tumor IFP that limits efficacy of current sys-
temic therapy by targeting and disrupting tumor vasculature
and delivers paclitaxel to cancer cells. We evaluated the efficacy
of a novel nanomedicine, CYT-21625, in a transgenic and meta-
static mouse model of endocrine cancers. Because CYT-21625
selectively targets intratumoral blood vessels passively by EPR
effect and actively by rhTNF, we first demonstrated, using gene
expression profiling analysis and tissue microarray, that all hu-
man ATC samples and half of differentiated thyroid cancer
samples overexpressed TNFRSF1A mRNA and protein in blood
vessels and/or tumor cell cytoplasm. Because the normal thy-
roid tissue samples in GSE33630 were from patients with post-
Chernobyl PTC, commonly associated with lymphocytic thy-
roiditis, high expression of TNFRSF1B mRNA can be from
regulatory T cells found in lymphocytic thyroiditis (33). In addi-
tion, eight of 13 primary PNET samples expressed TNFRSF1A in
intratumoral blood vessels, including one in cytoplasm. The
results suggest that CYT-21625 can preferentially target differ-
entiated thyroid cancers, ATC, and PNETs. CYT-21625 was effec-
tive in mice with metastatic human ATC cells, as demonstrated
by a statistically significantly lower tumor burden in the CYT-
21625-treated group. We observed a statistically significantly
lower tumor burden in mice with metastatic human FTC in the
CYT-21625 group after three weeks of treatment. Although the
difference in luciferase activity did not reach statistical signifi-
cance in mice with metastatic FTC-133 xenografts on week 4 be-
cause of type II error from reduced sample size as three mice in
the non-CYT-21625 group died after week 3 treatment, the aver-
age luciferase activity on week 4 was even lower than the base-
line, suggesting the efficacy of CYT-21625 in reducing tumor
burden. A larger sample size would provide sufficient power to
show the difference. Immunohistochemistry showed decreased
cell proliferation, increased apoptosis, loss of CD34 expression
in tumor vasculature, and vascular leakage demonstrated by ex-
travasation of fibrinogen, consistent with the effect of rhTNF.
Animals tolerated CYT-21625 with no histologic evidence of
normal organ toxicity. Furthermore, we used DCE-MRI to dem-
onstrate the enhanced vascular permeability in MEN1 KO mice
with PNETs treated with CYT-6091 and CYT-21625. CT and PET
scans showed a selective accumulation of CYT-6091 and CYT-
21625 in the PNETs of the mice. A statistically significant, pro-
gressive, and time-dependent decrease in serum insulin level
was observed in MEN1 KO mice with insulinomas treated with
CYT-21625 (26). The results warrant a clinical study to deter-
mine the efficacy of CYT-21625 as a novel therapy for advanced
PDTC, ATC, and PNET.
CYT-21625 maximizes efficacy and minimizes off-target
effects by targeting tumor vasculature and delivering paclitaxel
analogue to tumor cells. We demonstrated that CYT-6091, a pre-
cursor of CYT-21625, comprised of rhTNF bound to 27 nm

 is a good delivering system for proteins such as rhTNF because
it strongly and preferentially binds to these molecules through
the available thiol group (20). Colloidal gold has been safely
used clinically for decades in the treatment of rheumatoid ar-
thritis, and radio-gold colloids have been used in various hu-
man therapeutics (36,37). This suggests that colloidal gold
particles should be a safe platform for a new drug delivery sys-
tem. However, the antitumor effect of rhTNF alone is minimal,
while the combination of rhTNF followed by chemotherapy can
result in a dramatic response (38,39). It has been proposed that
rhTNF induces vascular hyperpermeability in the tumor, which
enhances the efficacy of chemotherapy. The clinical evidence
supporting this concept is best exemplified by the results of iso-
lated hyperthermic limb perfusion with rhTNF and melphalan
for in-transit melanoma or sarcoma, where overall response
rates ranged from 75% to 100% (40–42). In this study, we show a
superior antitumor effect of CYT-21625 that combined the
results of intratumoral vascular disruption from rhTNF and the
antiproliferation effect from paclitaxel. Compared with mice
treated with intravenous paclitaxel, treatment with CYT-21625

 delivering the same dose of paclitaxel resulted in statistically
significant lower tumor burden, suggesting a more effective de-
livery system. Because CYT-21625 actively targets TNFRSF1A
and passively targets tumor vasculature by enhanced perme-
ability and retention effect, we believe CYT-21625 should still be
effective in tumors with low TNFRSF1A expression at the appro-
priate dosage. Further study in TNFRSF1A-negative tumors is
warranted. Although we observed CYT-6091 and CYT-21625 in
the liver, there were no other histologic changes in hepatocytes
or vascular leakage that suggest liver toxicity. The liver deposi-
tion may be from the mononuclear phagocyte system scaveng-
ing the gold nanoparticles. The increased AUC in DCE-MRI is
consistent with the effect of rhTNF in CYT-6091 and CYT-21625
that caused vascular hyperpermeability and the detection of
MRI contrast in tumor tissue (43). The histologic confirmation of
vascular leakage was demonstrated by the extravasation of fi-
brinogen in the tumor tissue of mice treated with nanomedi-
cines. The extravasation and deposition of clotting factors such
as fibrinogen is used to demonstrate an increased vascular per-
meability (44). CYT-21625 preferentially and selectively targeted
tumors as demonstrated by CT, PET, and MRI without evidence
of off-target effects on histologic examination of normal organs.
There have been few studies in thyroid cancers that investi-
gate the antitumor efficacy of nanoparticles carrying various pay-
loads such as chemotherapeutics, radioisotopes, and small
interfering RNA (siRNA) to silence oncogenes (45–47). Paolino
et al. demonstrated the improved in vitro and in vivo efficacy of
thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) conjugated nanoliposomes
encapsulated with gemcitabine in FTC-133 cells (47). However,
PDTC and ATC often have low or absent expression of the TSH re-
ceptor, which could affect the efficacy of this delivery system. In
this study, we show that CYT-21625 was effective in PDTC, ATC,
and PNETs. It is possible that CYT-21625 could be effective in a
wide range of solid cancers, as it specifically targets tumor vascu-
lature and then delivers the paclitaxel to the tumor. In contrast to
other systems delivering siRNA (46) or a novel radioisotope (45)
without any known safety profiles, CYT-21625 delivers rhTNF and
paclitaxel, which have been used clinically with known toxicity
profiles. Unlike an siRNA delivery system, CYT-21625 does not re-
quire specific mutations and can be effective in a broad range of
solid cancers. Because pharmacokinetics and toxicity profiles of
paclitaxel and CYT-6091, a prototype of CYT-21625 without pacli-
taxel, have been well studied in clinical trials (35), we anticipate
that the CYT-21625 will be well tolerated in patients with ad-
vanced
thyroid
cancers,
PNETs,
and
other
solid
tumors.
Pazopanib, a multikinase inhibitor affecting tumor vasculature,
potentiates the antitumor effects of paclitaxel in vitro and in vivo
(48). Currently, a randomized, phase II clinical trial that studies
the effects of intensity-modulated radiotherapy and paclitaxel
with and without pazopanib is ongoing. CYT-21625 uses a similar
concept to target and disrupt tumor vasculature, specifically deliv-
ers paclitaxel, to tumor cells. Thus, fewer off-target adverse effects
are expected than with systemically administered treatments.
CYT-21625 requires tissue GSH to release paclitaxel analogue
to the cells; thus, in vitro studies of cells treated with CYT-21625
are not feasible. However, the mechanisms of action of pacli-
taxel are well studied (49). Although the maximum tolerated
dose of CYT-21625 in mice is not yet known, we anticipated it to
be several times higher than the equivalent doses of intrave-
nous rhTNF and paclitaxel, as demonstrated in a phase I clinical
trial of CYT-6091 (35). It is possible that CYT-21625 may be more
effective at a higher dose. In addition, the flexibility of the gold
nanoparticles system in delivering various payloads may be fur-
ther explored. Gold nanoparticles have been used in diagnostic
and photothermal and photodynamic therapy (50). CYT-6091
combined with radiation reduced tumor IFS and resulted in syn-
ergistic antitumor response in vivo (34).
The limitations of this study included small sample size in mice
with FTC-133 xenografts. Although the tumor burden in mice
treated with CYT-21625 was lower than other groups after four
weeks of treatments, the difference did not reach statistical signifi-
cance due to type II error, as mice in the non-CYT-21625 group died.
In addition, the lack of definitive marker specifically for cellular ef-
fect caused by paclitaxel makes the assessment of the antiprolifera-
tive mechanism difficult. We are unable to specify whether the
antitumor effect was caused by rhTNF or paclitaxel or both.
In summary, we demonstrated that PDTC, ATC, and PNETs
are suitable targets for CYT-21625. CYT-21625 treatment in mice
with metastatic human PDTC and ATC resulted in a smaller tu-
mor burden by inducing tumor vascular endothelial damage,
vascular leakage, and apoptosis, and by decreasing cell prolifer-
ation without toxicity. Tumor selectivity and the increased tu-
mor vascular permeability were demonstrated by CT, PET, and
DCE-MRI in MEN1 KO mice with insulinomas and by histology
in mice with metastatic human PDTC and ATC xenografts. CYT-
21625 effectively reduced serum insulin in mice with insulino-
mas. Thus, CYT-21625 is a promising novel therapy that should
be studied in patients with advanced PDTC, ATC, and PNETs.
