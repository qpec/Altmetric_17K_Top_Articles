Abstract
We screened DNA sequence variants on an exome-focused genotyping array in >300,000 
participants with replication in >280,000 participants and identified 444 independent variants in 
250 loci significantly associated with total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and/or triglycerides (TG). At two loci 
(JAK2 and A1CF), experimental analysis in mice revealed lipid changes consistent with the 
human data. We utilized mapped variants to address four clinically relevant questions and found 
the following: (1) beta-thalassemia trait carriers displayed lower TC and were protected from 
coronary artery disease; (2) outside of the CETP locus, there was not a predictable relationship 
between plasma HDL-C and risk for age-related macular degeneration; (3) only some mechanisms 
of lowering LDL-C seemed to increase risk for type 2 diabetes; and (4) TG-lowering alleles 
involved in hepatic production of TG-rich lipoproteins (e.g., TM6SF2, PNPLA3) tracked with 
higher liver fat, higher risk for type 2 diabetes, and lower risk for coronary artery disease whereas

 TG-lowering alleles involved in peripheral lipolysis (e.g., LPL, ANGPTL4) had no effect on liver 
fat but lowered risks for both type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease.
Plasma lipid levels are modifiable risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. 
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) testing common DNA sequence variation have 
uncovered 175 genetic loci affecting lipid levels1 in the population2–8. These findings have 
informed biology of lipoproteins and elucidated the causal roles of lipid levels on 
cardiovascular disease9–12. Here, we build on these previous efforts to: 1) perform an 
exome-wide association screen for plasma lipids in >300,000 individuals; 2) evaluate 
discovered alleles experimentally; and 3) test the inter-relationship of mapped lipid variants 
with coronary artery disease (CAD), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), fatty liver, 
and type 2 diabetes (T2D).
We tested the association of genotypes from the HumanExome BeadChip (i.e., exome array) 
with lipid levels in 73 studies encompassing >300,000 participants (Supplementary Material, 
Supplementary Tables 1–3) across several ancestries with the maximal sample sizes being 
237,050 for European, 16,935 for African, 37,613 for South Asian, and 5,082 for Hispanic 
or other. A companion manuscript describes results for 47,532 East Asian participants13. A 
total of 242,289 variants were analyzed after quality control, about one-third of which are 
non-synonymous with minor allele frequency (MAF) < 0.1% (Supplementary Table 4).
Single-variant association statistics and linkage disequilibrium information summarized 
across 1 megabase sliding windows were generated from each cohort using 
RAREMETALWORKER or RVTESTS14,15 software. Meta-analyses of single variant and 
gene-level association tests were performed using rareMETALS (version 6.0). Genomic 
control values for meta-analysis results were between 1.09 and 1.14 for all four traits 
(Supplementary Figure 1), suggesting that population structure in our analysis is well-
controlled4,16.
We identified 1,445 single variants associated at P<2.1×10−7 (Bonferroni correction of 
242,289 variants analyzed) (Supplementary Figures 2–5). Full association results are 
available (see URLs). Of these, 75 were ‘novel’ [i.e. located at least 1 megabase from 
previously reported GWAS signals]: 35 of these were protein-altering variants and 40 were 
non-coding variants (Table 1, Supplementary Tables 5–7). The MAF of the lead variant was 
>5% at 61 of these 75 loci. European ancestry participants provided the most significant 
associations for the 75 novel loci, with the exception of two LDL associated variants 
(rs201148465 and rs147032017) which were driven by the South Asian participants 
(Supplementary Table 8). Gene-level association analyses revealed an additional five genes 
where the signal was driven by multiple rare variants (P <4.2×10−7, Bonferroni correction 
threshold for performing 5 tests on ~20,000 genes, Supplementary Table 9).
We sought replication in up to 286,268 independent participants from three studies – Nord-
Trøndelag Health Study17, (HUNT; max n = 62,168), Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI; 
max n = 6,411, see URLs) and the Million Veteran Program18 (MVP; max n = 218,117). Of 
the novel primary trait associations, 73/73 associations were directionally consistent 
(Supplementary Table 10); two SNPs were not available for replication (rs201148465, 
Liu et al.

 rs75862065). Furthermore, we were able to replicate the associations of 66/73 (90%) at 
α=0.05.
At any given genetic locus, multiple variants may independently contribute to plasma lipid 
levels. We quantified this phenomenon by iteratively performing association analyses 
conditional on the top variants at each locus. We identified 444 variants independently 
associated with one or more of the four lipid traits in 75 novel and 175 previously implicated 
loci (Supplementary Figure 6; Supplementary Table 11–12).
The identification of lipid-associated coding variants may help refine association signals at 
previously identified GWAS loci. We were able to evaluate this possibility in 131 of the 175 
previously reported GWAS loci where the index or proxy variant was available on the exome 
array, and associated with lipids levels with P<2.1×10−7 (Supplementary Table 13–14). For 
example, an intronic SNP (rs11136341, close to the PLEC gene) associated with LDL-C was 
the original lead SNP in its GWAS locus (P=2×10−13). In the current study, a protein-
altering variant in PARP10 is the top variant in the same locus (rs11136343; Leu395Pro; 
P=7×10−26). After conditioning on PARP10 Leu395Pro, the evidence for rs11136341 
diminished (P = 0.02); in contrast, PARP10 Leu395Pro remained significant (P=9×10−13) 
after conditioning on rs11136341. PARP10 has been shown to affect the hepatic secretion of 
apolipoprotein B (apoB) in human hepatocytes19; these results prioritize PARP10 as a causal 
gene at this locus.
Experimental analysis of discovered mutations in model systems is a powerful approach to 
validate the results of a human genetics analysis. We prioritized two coding mutations for 
experimental analysis: JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2) p.Val617Phe and A1CF (APOBEC1 
complementation factor) p.Gly398Ser.
JAK2 p.Val617Phe is a recurrent somatic mutation arising in hematopoietic stem cells which 
can lead to myeloproliferative disorders or clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate 
potential20–24. We recently showed that carriage of p.Val617Phe increases with age and 
confers higher risk for CAD25. Surprisingly, the 617Phe allele which increases risk for CAD 
is associated with lower LDL-C. Mice knocked in for Jak2 p.Val617Phe were created as 
reported previously26. Hypercholesterolemia-prone mice that were engrafted with bone 
marrow obtained from Jak2 p.Val617Phe transgenic mice displayed lower total cholesterol 
than mice that had received control bone marrow (Supplementary Figure 7). This is 
consistent with our human genetic observations. The mechanism by which JAK2 
p.Val617Phe leads to lower plasma TC and LDL-C but higher risk for CAD requires further 
study.
Another new association to emerge from genetic analyses was between A1CF p.Gly398Ser 
and TG [MAF 0.7%, 0.10-standard deviation (SD) increase in TG per copy of alternate 
allele, P=4×10−11]; this variant was also associated with increased circulating TC 
(P=4×10−7) and nominally associated with increased risk of CAD (OR=1.12; P=0.02). 
A1CF encodes APOBEC1 complementation factor, an RNA-binding protein which 
facilitates the RNA-editing action of APOBEC1 on the APOB transcript27,28. We performed

 CRISPR-Cas9 deletion, rescue, and knock-in experiments to assess whether A1CF 
p.Gly398Ser is a causal mutation that alters TG metabolism.
CRISPR-Cas9-induced deletion of A1CF led to 72% and 65% reduction in secreted 
APOB100 compared to control cells in Huh7 and HepG2 human hepatoma cells, 
respectively (Figure 1A–1C; Supplementary Figure 8). These findings are consistent with 
previous studies in rat primary hepatocytes that also showed significantly decreased apoB 
secretion after RNAi-based depletion of A1CF29. Additionally, cellular APOB100 levels 
were significantly reduced in A1CF-deficient cells (Supplementary Figure 8B and 8C). A 
subsequent “rescue” experiment involving overexpression of wild-type or A1CF 
p.Gly398Ser in Huh7 cells with or without endogenous A1CF expression confirmed that 
higher APOB100 secretion in cell lines expressing A1CF p.Gly398Ser (Figure 1D).
We sought to further validate the A1CF gene and the p.Gly398Ser variant through the use of 
CRISPR-Cas9 to generate knock-in mice. Using a guide RNA targeting A1cf exon 9, the site 
of the codon for p.Gly398, and a 162-nucleotide single-strand DNA oligonucleotide repair 
template containing the p.Gly398Ser variant as well as extra synonymous changes to prevent 
re-cleavage by CRISPR-Cas9, we generated mice of the C57BL/6J inbred background with 
an A1cf Gly398Ser allele (hereafter referred to as KI) (Supplementary Figure 9A, 9B). We 
bred the KI allele to homozygosity and found that KI/KI mice were viable and healthy. We 
compared wild-type and KI/KI colony mates (n=9, 8) with respect to TG levels 
(Supplementary Figure 9C, 9D). We found that KI/KI mice had 46% increased TG 
compared to wild-type mice (P=0.05). In sum, these results indicate that A1CF is a causal 
gene for TG in humans and that the p.Gly398Ser variant is a causal mutation, with possible 
relevance to CAD.
Next, we used the 444 identified DNA sequence variants to address four clinical questions. 
First, a rare null mutation in the beta-globin gene (HBB; c.92+1G>A, rs33971440) 
associated with lower total cholesterol (Supplementary Table 15) with the strongest total 
cholesterol-lowering effect after null mutations in PCSK9; this raised the question of the 
relationship between beta-thalassemia and risk for CAD. Approximately 80 to 90 million 
individuals worldwide are estimated to carry a heterozygous loss-of-function HBB mutation, 
termed beta-thalassemia trait30. Observational epidemiologic studies showed that beta-
thalassemia trait associates with lower blood cholesterol level31,32. We find that HBB c.
92+1G>A is associated with a 17 mg/dl decrease in LDL-C (95% CI: −23, −11; 
P=2.7×10−8) and a 21 mg/dl decrease in TC (95% CI: −27, −14; P=8.9×10−11) 
(Supplementary Figure 10). In an analysis of 31,156 CAD cases and 65,787 controls, 
carriers of loss-of-function variants in HBB were protected against CAD (odds ratio for 
CAD, 0.70; 95% CI 0.54, 0.90; P=0.005, Supplementary Figure 11). Of note, in 
Supplementary Table 15, we provide results for null mutations where association P<0.001 
for any of the four lipid traits.
Second, DNA sequence variants in the CETP gene which associate with higher HDL-C also 
correlate with higher risk for AMD, a leading cause of blindness33–37; here, we ask if any 
way of increasing plasma HDL-C will predictably lead to increased AMD risk. Across 168 
independent HDL-C variants with MAF > 1%, we tested the association of each HDL-C

 variant with AMD risk. The effect size of variant on HDL-C was positively correlated with 
its effect on AMD risk (correlation in effect sizes, r=0.41, P=4.4×10−8; Supplementary Table 
16, Supplementary Figure 12). However, this effect was driven by the 10 independent HDL-
C associated variants in CETP (heterogeneity across the different HDL-C-raising 
mechanisms (τ2 = 0.91, Phet=1.8×10−15) (Supplementary Table 17). When these 10 CETP 
variants were removed, there was no longer a relationship between genetically-altered HDL-
C and AMD risk (P=0.17). These results suggest that outside of the CETP locus, there is not 
a predictable relationship between plasma HDL-C and risk for AMD.
Third, will lowering LDL-C with lipid-modifying medicines always increase risk for T2D? 
This question is motivated by the fact that in randomized controlled trials, statin therapy 
increases risk for T2D26,27 and recent reports of PCSK9 variants associating with higher risk 
for T2D38–40. We confirmed the association of PCSK9 p.Arg46Leu (R46L) with risk for 
T2D among 222,877 participants (Supplementary Table 18). We found that the 46Leu allele 
associated with lower LDL-C confers a 13% increased risk for T2D (OR 1.13; 95% CI 1.06–
1.20; P=6.96×10−5) (Supplementary Figure 13). In addition, across 113 independent LDL-C 
variants at 90 distinct loci, we compared each variant’s effect on LDL-C with its subsequent 
effect on risk for T2D. Across the 113 variants, there is a weak inverse correlation between a 
variant’s effects on LDL-C and T2D (r=−0.21, p=0.025); however, there is evidence for 
heterogeneity in this relationship (τ2=0.50, Phet=2.5×10−9). Five LDL-C lowering genetic 
mechanisms had the most compelling evidence for association with higher risk for T2D 
(TM6SF2 p.Glu167Lys, APOE chr19:4510002, HNF4A p.Thr136Ile, PNPLA3 p.Ile148Met, 
and GCKR p.Leu446Pro) (P<4.0×10−4 for each, Bonferroni correction threshold for 
performing tests at 113 variants, Supplementary Table 19; Supplementary Figure 14). These 
results suggest that only some ways of lowering LDL-C are likely to increase risk for T2D.
Finally, two key processes – hepatic production and peripheral lipolysis – contribute to the 
blood level of TG. We asked how genes involved in hepatic production of TG-rich 
lipoproteins (PNPLA3, TM6SF2) differed from lipolysis pathway genes (LPL, ANGPTL4) 
in their impact on related metabolic traits - blood lipids, fatty liver, T2D, and CAD (Table 2). 
The alternative alleles at PNPLA3 p.Ile148Met, TM6SF2 p.Glu167Lys, LPL p.Ser474Ter, 
and ANGTPL4 p.Glu40Lys all associated with lower blood triglycerides and reduced risk 
for CAD. However, the blood TG-lowering alleles at PNPLA3 and TM6SF6 led to more 
fatty liver and higher risk for T2D. In contrast, the blood triglyceride-lowering alleles at LPL 
and ANGPTL4 were neutral with respect to fatty liver and led to lower risk for T2D. We 
confirmed the LPL observation using a phenome-wide association study in the UK Biobank 
(Supplementary Table 20). In UK Biobank, a one-SD decrease in TG mediated by LPL 
variants reduced risks for both T2D and CAD (Figure 2).
In summary, combining large-scale human genetic analysis with experimental evidence, we 
demonstrate: (1) 444 independent coding and non-coding variants at 250 loci as associated 
with plasma lipids; (2) the use of mouse models and genome editing to pinpoint causal genes 
and protein-altering variants; and (3) that LPL activation can be expected to lower 
triglycerides and reduce risks for both CAD and T2D without increasing liver fat and thus be 
advantageous for patients with metabolic risk factors.

 ONLINE METHODS
Study samples and phenotypes
Seventy-three studies contributed association results for exome chip genotypes and plasma 
lipid levels. The outcomes were fasting lipid values in mg/dl [TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, TG] 
from the baseline, or earlier exam with fasting measures. If a study only had non-fasting 
levels, then it contributed only to the TC and HDL-C analyses. LDL-C and TG analyses 
were only performed on fasting lipid values. Lipid-lowering therapy with statins was not 
routinely used prior to the publication of the 4S study in 1994 which demonstrated the 
clinical benefit of statin therapy. Therefore, for data collected before 1994, no lipid 
medication adjustment was applied. For data collected after 1994, we adjusted the TC values 
for individuals on lipid medication by replacing their total cholesterol values by TC/0.8; this 
adjustment estimates the effect of statins on TC values. No adjustment was made on HDL-C 
or TG. LDL-C was calculated using the Friedewald equation for those with TG < 400 mg/dl 
(LDL-C = TC – HDL-C – (TG/5)). If TC was modified as described above for medication 
use after 1994, then modified TC was used in this formula. If only measured LDL-C was 
available in a study, we used LDL/0.7 for those on lipid-lowering medication when data 
were collected after 1994. TG values were natural log transformed. For each phenotype, 
residuals were obtained after accounting for age, age2, sex, principal components (as needed 
by each study, up to four), and inverse normal transform residuals were created for analysis. 
For studies ascertained on CAD case/control status, the two groups were modeled as 
separate studies.
Genotyping and quality control
All studies assayed the Illumina or Affymetrix Human Exome array v1 or v1.1. Genotypes 
were determined from Zcall43 or joint calling44. Individual studies performed the following 
quality control: call rate, heterozygosity, gender discordance, GWAS discordance (if GWAS 
data available), fingerprint concordance, if available, and PCA outliers.
Association analyses
Each contributing cohort analyzed the ancestries within their cohorts separately and studies 
collected on case/control status analyzed cases separately from the controls. We performed 
both single variant and gene-level association tests. In the association analysis, we obtain 
residuals after controlling for sex, age, age2 and up to 4 principal components as covariates. 
Studies that had related samples analyzed the association using linear mixed models with 
relatedness estimated from genome-wide SNPs or from pedigrees.
From each study, we collected single variant score statistics and their covariance matrix for 
variants in sliding windows across the genome. Summary association test statistics were 
generated using RAREMETALWORKER or RVTESTS. Using summary association 
statistics collected from each study, we performed meta-analysis of single variant association 
tests using the Mantel-Haenszel test and constructed burden, SKAT and variable threshold 
tests using the approach by Liu et al15. For burden and SKAT, we used minor allele 
frequency thresholds of 1% and 5% and for VT, we applied minor allele frequency threshold

 of 5%. In the SKAT test, variants are weighted according to their minor allele frequencies, 
using the beta kernel β (1,25).
Using covariance matrices between single variant association statistics, we were also able to 
perform conditional association analyses centrally, which distinguishes genuine signals from 
“shadows” of known loci. Details of the methods can be found in Liu et al15.
We centrally performed quality control for the data. We aligned study reported reference and 
alternative alleles with alleles reported in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project45 and 
remove mis-labelled variant sites that can be strand ambiguous. For variant sites in each 
study, we removed variants that had call rate < 0.9 or had Hardy Weinberg P values 
<1×10−7. Finally, as additional checks, we visually inspected for each study the scatter plot 
of variant allele frequency against frequencies from ethnicity-matched populations in the 
1000 Genomes Project46, and made sure that the strand and allele labels were well calibrated 
between studies.
Single variant associations with P < 2.1 × 10−7 (0.05/242,289 variants analyzed) and gene-
based associations with P < 4.2 × 10−7 (0.05/[20,000 genes * 6 tests]) were considered 
significant. Novel loci were defined as being not within 1 megabase of a known lipid GWAS 
SNP. Additionally, linkage disequilibrium information was used to determine independent 
SNPs where a locus extended beyond 1 megabase. All novel loci reported in this manuscript 
are > 1 megabase from any previously reported locus and independent (r2 < 0.2 was required 
for variants within 3 megabases).
Sequential forward selection
To identify independently associated variants for each known and newly identified locus, we 
performed sequential forward selection. We initialized the set of independently associated 
variants (denoted by Φ), starting with the top association signal in the locus. For each 
iteration, conditioning on variants in Φ, we performed conditional association analyses for 
all remaining variants. If the top association signal after the conditional analysis remained 
significant, we added the top variant to the set Φ, and then repeated the conditional 
association analysis. If the top variant after the conditional analysis was no longer 
significant, we stopped and reported variants in the set Φ as the final set of independent 
variants for that locus. We used the same single variant significance threshold (P < 2.1 × 
10−7) to determine statistical significance with the sequential forward selection results 
(Supplementary Figure 3).
Annotation
Sequence variants were annotated according to refSeq version 1.9, using the SEQMINER 
software (version 5.7)47. Transcript level annotations were obtained and prioritized. When 
multiple transcript level annotations were available, they were prioritized according to their 
functionality and deleteriousness. To implement gene-level association tests, the annotation 
with the highest priority was used (along with other filtering criteria such as minor allele 
frequencies) to determine the set of variants that are included.

 Heritability and proportion of variance explained estimates
We estimated the proportion of variance explained by the set of 444 independently 
associated variants. The joint effects of variants in a locus were approximated by 
, where 
 is the single variant score statistics and 
 is 
the covariance matrix between them. The covariance between single variant genetic effects 
was approximated by the inverse of the variance-covariance matrix of score statistics, i.e. 
. The phenotypic variance explained by the independently associated variants in a 
locus is given by 
, where G is the genotypes of the analyzed variants.
Refinement of genome-wide association signals
We sought to quantify what proportion of GWAS loci might be due to a protein-altering 
variant and, therefore, directly identify a functional gene. We made the assumption that a 
protein-altering variant is the most likely causal variant for each region if it is the top signal, 
explains the signal, or is independent of the original signal. To identify putative functional 
coding variants accounting for the effects at known lipid loci, we performed reciprocal 
conditional analyses to control for the effects of known lipid GWAS or coding variants 
within 500kb, as this was the maximum distance for variants within the covariance matrix. 
Loci where coding variants are the most significant signals were considered as “coding as 
top”. Loci where the initial GWAS variants had conditional P > 0.01 were considered to be 
explained by the coding variants. Loci where the coding variants had conditional P < 2.1 × 
10−7 were considered to be independent of the initial GWAS signals.
JAK2 p.Val617Phe and plasma cholesterol in a mouse model
Jak2 p.Val617Phe MxCre mice were created and reported previously26. Bone marrow cells 
from the WT or JAK2 p.Val617Phe MxCre mice, both treated with poly I:C, were 
transplanted into irradiated Ldlr−/− recipients. After four weeks of recovery, the Ldlr−/− 
recipient mice were fed a Western diet (TD88137, Harlan Teklad) for 8 weeks. Plasma was 
collected and 250 microliter of polled plasma from 7 WT→Ldlr−/− or 7 Jak2 
Val617Phe→Ldlr−/− recipient was subjected to fast protein liquid chromatography on 
Sepharose CL-6B size exclusion column. Total cholesterol content in each fraction was 
assessed by Cholesterol E kit (Wako Diagnostics).
Validation of A1CF with CRISPR-Cas9 in human cells
To knock out A1CF in Huh7 and HepG2 human hepatoma cells, three CRISPRs 
(Supplementary Table 21) targeting exon 4 of the A1CF gene were constructed by using the 
lentiviral vector lentiGuide-Puro. Packaged viruses were used to transduce the cells 
expressing Cas9 for 16 hours. Subsequently, cells were cultured in the presence of 5 μg/ml 
puromycin for five days before splitting for assays. Cells for APOB secretion assay were 
cultured for 18 hours in serum-free medium, then the amount of APOB100 in medium was 
measured using an ELISA kit (MABTECH) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
In a rescue experiment, to avoid cutting of the A1CF coding region on the recombinant 
plasmids by previously designed exon-targeting CRISPRs, four new CRISPRs targeting

 introns flanking exon 4 were applied to deplete endogenous A1CF. The sequences for those 
sgRNAs are available in Supplementary Table 21. The A1CF p.Gly398Ser variant was 
generated by using overlapping PCR and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Both wild-type 
and the A1CF p.Gly398Ser variant were constructed into lentiviral plasmids, respectively. 
After transduction, cells were cultured for 48 hours in the presence of 100 ng/ml 
doxycycline to induce recombinant expression of A1CF or p.Gly398Ser variant before 
performing different assays.
A1cf p.Gly390Ser knock-in mice
All procedures used for animal studies were approved by Harvard University’s Faculty of 
Arts and Sciences Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were consistent with 
local, state, and federal regulations as applicable. Knock-in mice were generated using a 
guide RNA designed to target the orthologous site of the A1CF p.Gly390Ser variant. In vitro 
transcribed Cas9 mRNA (100 ng/μL; TriLink BioTechnologies) and guide RNA (50 ng/μL) 
were co-injected with 100 ng/μL single-strand DNA oligonucleotide (Integrated DNA 
Technologies): (Supplementary Table 21) into the cytoplasm of fertilized oocytes from 
C57BL/6J mice. Genomic DNA samples from founder mice were screened for knock-in 
mutations by PCR and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Positive mice were bred with 
C57BL/6J mice to generate wild-type and homozygous knock-in mice. Male colony mates at 
12 weeks of age were used for lipid measurements. Blood samples were collected from the 
lateral tail vein following an overnight fast. Plasma triglyceride levels were measured using 
Infinity Triglycerides Reagent (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturers’ instructions.
Intersection of lipid association signals with AMD, CAD, and T2D
To estimate the association of loss-of-function variants in HBB with cholesterol levels, 
participants from the following two consortia were studied: the Global Lipids Genetics 
Consortium and the Myocardial Infarction Genetics Consortium (MIGen, 27,939 
participants in 12 cohorts). A rare loss-of-function variant in HBB (c.92+1G>A, 
rs33971440) was genotyped in participants from the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium 
Exome consortium. This variant was pooled with sequence data for the HBB gene in 
MIGen, available in 19,434 participants with blood cholesterol measurements. The 
association of loss-of-function variants with cholesterol was estimated using linear 
regression with adjustment for age, sex and up to five principal components of ancestry. 
Estimates from genotyped and sequence data were pooled using inverse variance weighted 
fixed effects meta-analysis.
To estimate the association of loss-of-function variants in HBB with CAD, participants from 
the following two consortia were studied: the CARDIoGRAM Exome Consortium (69,087 
participants from 20 studies) and MIGen (12,384 CAD cases and 15,547 controls from 12 
studies). 69,086 individuals who were genotyped for the c.92+1G>A variant in 
CARDIoGRAM Exome were pooled with sequence data for HBB from 27,931 individuals 
in MIGen. The association of loss-of-function variants with CAD was estimated using 
logistic regression with adjustment for age, sex and up to five principal components of 
ancestry. Estimates were pooled using inverse variance weighted fixed effects meta-analysis.

 hematocrit levels, estimates from an exome chip analysis of red blood cell traits (24,814 
individuals) were used8.
For 168 variants independently and significantly associated with HDL-C and a MAF > 1%, 
we looked up the association evidence in 16,144 AMD cases and 17,832 controls with 
exome chip genotypes48.
For 132 independently and significantly associated LDL-C variants and MAF > 1%, we 
looked up the association evidence in: (1) up to 120,575 individuals with and without CAD 
and exome chip genotypes (42,335 cases and 78,240 controls)42; and (2) up to 69,870 
individuals with and without type 2 diabetes. Only 113 of the 132 LDL variants were 
available in the type 2 diabetes results. We used a Bonferroni correction for 132 variants to 
determine significance of the results (alpha = 4.0 × 10−4).
Association of PCSK9 R46L with type 2 diabetes
For evaluating the association of PCSK9 R46L with risk of type 2 diabetes, we considered a 
total of 42,011 type 2 diabetes cases and 180,834 controls from 30 studies from populations 
of European ancestry (Supplementary Table 18). The variant was directly genotyped in all 
studies using the Metabochip or the Exome array. Sample and variant quality control was 
performed within each study as described previously49–52. Within each study, the variant 
was tested for association with type 2 diabetes under an additive model after adjustment for 
study-specific covariates, including principal components to adjust for population structure. 
Association summary statistics for the variant for each study was corrected for residual 
population structure using the genomic control inflation factor as described previously49–51. 
We then combined association summary statistics for the variant across studies via fixed-
effects inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis.
TG variants, lipids, fatty liver, type 2 diabetes, and CAD
Exome chip results for four variants (LPL p.Ser474Ter [rs328], ANGPTL4 p.Glu40Lys 
[rs116843064], PNPLA3 p.Ile148Met [rs738409], and TM6SF2 p.Glu167Lys [rs58542926]) 
were obtained from the following sources:
1.
lipids: current analysis
2.
fatty liver: Between 2002 and 2005, 1,400 individuals from the Framingham 
Offspring Study and 2,011 individuals from third generation underwent multi-
detector computed tomograms (CT) on which we evaluated liver attenuation as 
previously described53. We tested the association of TG variants with CT liver fat 
after inverse normal transformation. Covariates in the regression models included 
age, age2, and gender. A similar analysis was conducted in 3,293 participants of 
European ancestry from BioImage study54. Association results for liver 
attenuation from the Framingham and BioImage studies were combined through 
fixed-effects inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis.

 Figure 1. A1CF p.Gly398Ser mutant leads to increased APOB100 secretion
a, Western blot showing the depletion of endogenous A1CF levels via CRISPR/Cas9 system 
in both Huh7 and HepG2 cells. b and c, Lack of A1CF leads to reduced APOB100 secretion 
in Huh7 (b) and HepG2 (c) human hepatoma cells. d, Recombinantly overexpressed A1CF 
p.Gly398Ser variant led to significantly increased APOB100 secretion compared to A1CF or 
GFP control in both Huh7 wild-type and A1CF knockout cells (labeled as A1CF KO), 
respectively. The bars of mean value and error bars of SD are showed in b, c and d from 
experiments with biological replicates, N=6. Statistically significant differences are marked 
(*p<0.05, **p<0.01).
