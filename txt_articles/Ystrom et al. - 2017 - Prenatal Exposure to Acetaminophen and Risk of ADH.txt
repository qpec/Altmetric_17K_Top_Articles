OBJECTIVES: To estimate the association between maternal use of acetaminophen during 
pregnancy and of paternal use before pregnancy with attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD) in offspring while adjusting for familial risk for ADHD and indications of 
acetaminophen use.
METHODS: Diagnoses were obtained from the Norwegian Patient Registry for 112 973 
offspring from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, including 2246 with ADHD. 
We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for an ADHD diagnosis by using Cox proportional hazard 
models.
RESULTS: After adjusting for maternal use of acetaminophen before pregnancy, familial 
risk for ADHD, and indications of acetaminophen use, we observed a modest association 
between any prenatal maternal use of acetaminophen in 1 (HR = 1.07; 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 0.96–1.19), 2 (HR = 1.22; 95% CI 1.07–1.38), and 3 trimesters (HR = 1.27; 95% 
CI 0.99–1.63). The HR for more than 29 days of maternal acetaminophen use was 2.20 (95% 
CI 1.50–3.24). Use for <8 days was negatively associated with ADHD (HR = 0.90; 95% CI 
0.81–1.00). Acetaminophen use for fever and infections for 22 to 28 days was associated 
with ADHD (HR = 6.15; 95% CI 1.71–22.05). Paternal and maternal use of acetaminophen 
were similarly associated with ADHD.
CONCLUSIONS: Short-term maternal use of acetaminophen during pregnancy was negatively 
associated with ADHD in offspring. Long-term maternal use of acetaminophen during 
pregnancy was substantially associated with ADHD even after adjusting for indications of 
use, familial risk of ADHD, and other potential confounders.

What’s KnOWn On thIs subject: In previous 
studies, researchers have identified an association 
between acetaminophen use during pregnancy 
and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) 
in offspring. Maternal use of acetaminophen is 
associated with impulsivity; hence, it is unknown 
if the association is due to indications of use or 
familial risk for ADHD.
What thIs stuDy aDDs: After adjusting for familial 
risk for ADHD, indications of use, and acetaminophen 
use before pregnancy, long-term acetaminophen use 
during pregnancy is related to more than a twofold 
increase in risk for offspring ADHD.

 Acetaminophen is the recommended 
medication for pregnant women 
with fever or pain and is widely used 
during pregnancy. Reports have 
suggested that acetaminophen is 
used by ∼65% to 70% of pregnant 
women in the United States and 
by ∼50% to 60% of pregnant 
women in western and northern 
Europe.1, 
 
2 Acetaminophen crosses 
the placenta and can be traced in 
the infant’s urine after prenatal 
exposure.3 In 2013, researchers 
conducting a sibling comparison in a 
large, population-based Norwegian 
birth cohort study suggested that 
prenatal acetaminophen use for 28 
or more days was associated with 
poorer motor and communicational 
development and externalizing 
problems (ie, inattentiveness 
and aggression) in offspring.4 
The following year, researchers 
conducting a large Danish birth 
cohort study found an association 
between prenatal acetaminophen use 
and both a clinical attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) 
diagnosis and ADHD symptoms 
in offspring5; later, researchers 
in other studies related prenatal 
acetaminophen use to rating scales of 
disinhibited behavior.6, 
 
7
The Danish study5 had several 
strengths, including prospective 
assessment, a large sample size, and 
a number of relevant covariates. It 
also had some important limitations, 
especially possible residual 
confounding.8 Acetaminophen 
is recommended for pregnant 
women with fever and pain; it is 
also used for a wide array of other 
inflammatory conditions during 
pregnancy. Furthermore, it has 
been suggested that the presence 
of some of these conditions 
during pregnancy (eg, fever, 
inflammation, and autoimmunity) 
are associated with increased risk 
of neurodevelopmental disorders in 
offspring.9 
– 
12 To investigate potential 
adverse effects of acetaminophen 
on fetal development, it is therefore 
essential to allow for the potential 
influence of such underlying 
conditions. We have previously found 
that an impulsive personality is 
associated with acetaminophen use 
during pregnancy.13 It is therefore 
possible that acetaminophen use 
during pregnancy could be influenced 
by familial factors (including genetic 
influences) that may also influence 
the risk of offspring ADHD. It is 
therefore important to adjust for 
parental symptoms of ADHD.
If the association between 
acetaminophen use during pregnancy 
and offspring ADHD is due to 
unobserved maternal factors (eg, 
impulsive personality traits13), we 
would expect use before pregnancy 
to be no less associated with 
offspring ADHD than use during 
pregnancy. Prepregnancy use 
therefore serves as a negative control 
for the specificity of the gestational 
effect.14
If the association is due to 
unobserved familial factors 
(eg, genetic factors), paternal 
use of acetaminophen may also 
be associated with ADHD in a 
way similar to maternal use 
of acetaminophen. However, 
acetaminophen and endocrine 
disruptors have been shown to 
have potential for transgenerational 
disease transmission effects in mouse 
models via male germ-line epigenetic 
effects, and endocrine disruption 
effects of acetaminophen have been 
shown in the human testis.15, 
 
16 It is 
therefore important to estimate the 
effect of paternal prepregnancy use.
In the current study, we used data 
from a large, prospective, population-
based birth cohort from Norway to 
examine whether acetaminophen 
use during pregnancy was associated 
with ADHD in the offspring after 
adjusting for potential confounders. 
In contrast to researchers in previous 
studies, we were able to adjust for 
indications of acetaminophen use 
and parental symptoms of ADHD. We 
were furthermore able to analyze 
maternal use of acetaminophen 
before pregnancy as a negative 
control17 and to estimate the effect 
of paternal use before pregnancy on 
offspring ADHD.
MethODs
sample
Data were drawn from the 
Norwegian Mother and Child 
Cohort Study (MoBa) conducted by 
the Norwegian Institute of Public 
Health.18 Invitations were sent by 
mail to pregnant women in Norway 
in connection with the routine 
ultrasound examination offered at 
the local hospitals around pregnancy 
week 18, and 40.6% of the invited 
women consented to participate. The 
cohort includes 114 744 children 
born between 1999 and 2009, 95 242 
mothers, and 75 217 fathers from all 
over Norway. The establishment and 
data collection in MoBa has obtained 
a license from the Norwegian Data 
Inspectorate and approval from the 
Regional Committee for Medical 
Research Ethics. The current study 
was approved by the Regional 
Committee for Medical Research 
Ethics. Self-report questionnaires 
were sent to the mothers and 
fathers at approximately 18 weeks 
of gestation and to mothers later in 
pregnancy and after delivery. We 
used information from maternal 
questionnaires when children were 
6 months old, 1.5 years old, and 3 
years old in version 9 of the quality-
assured MoBa data files. We excluded 
1283 study subjects who died or 
emigrated during childhood and 488 
subjects without a recorded date of 
birth in the Medical Birth Registry of 
Norway. Our final sample comprised 
the eligible 112 973 children and 
their parents.

Classification of Diseases, 10th 
Revision diagnoses20 to NPR to 
receive financial reimbursement. 
By using individual personal 
identification numbers, diagnostic 
information from NPR was linked 
to MoBa. Thus, all MoBa children 
registered with an International 
Classification of Diseases, 10th 
Revision diagnosis of hyperkinetic 
disorder (F90.0, F90.1, F90.8, or 
F90.9) between 2008 and 2014 
were identified and regarded 
as having ADHD. Hyperkinetic 
disorder requires the combination 
of inattentive and hyperactive 
symptoms, and as a result, 
hyperkinetic disorder is a subtype 
nested within the Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, Fifth Edition classification 
of ADHD.21 In comparison with 
ADHD, hyperkinetic disorder is 
characterized by a higher proportion 
of patients with impaired language 
and motor development.22 Two cases 
were excluded from the analyses 
because of an F90 diagnosis before 
the age of 3.
Prenatal use of acetaminophen
Information on acetaminophen 
use was obtained through MoBa 
questionnaires. Acetaminophen 
use was available from 2 prenatal 
and 1 postnatal questionnaires. At 
week 18, week 30, and 6 months 
postpartum, the mothers were asked 
to report on 77, 32, and 19 different 
medical conditions, respectively. 
The mothers reported details on 
medication use specifically for each 
medical condition. In addition, at 
each time point, the mothers listed 
names of any additional medications 
used. For each indication, the mother 
could name the medication taken 
in an open textbox and specify the 
following exposure windows: 6 
months before gestation; gestational 
weeks 0 to 4, 5 to 8, 9 to 12, and 
≥13 (until completion of the first 
questionnaire); 13 to 16, 17 to 
20, 21 to 24, 25 to 28, and ≥29 
(until completion of the second 
questionnaire); and ≥30 (until birth), 
0 to 3 months postpartum, and 4 to 
6 months postpartum. Use 6 months 
before gestation was reported on 
53 of the 77 indications reported at 
week 18. In addition, mothers were 
asked to report all other medication 
use for all exposure windows in all 
questionnaires. Questionnaires can 
be found at www. 
fhi. 
no.
Number of days was reported 
as a total across all exposure 
windows in each questionnaire. The 
percentage of indications relating to 
acetaminophen use having 0, 1, or ≥2 
comedications were 88.9%, 10.0%, 
and 1.1%, respectively. Fathers 
filled out a separate questionnaire at 
gestational week 18. Therein, they 
reported their medication use for 
the last 6 months before pregnancy. 
We classified and grouped 
medication exposure according to 
the Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical 
Classification System developed by 
the World Health Organization.23 
Acetaminophen exposure was 
defined as using a drug with the 
Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical code 
N02BE01.
covariates
On the basis of previous literature, 
the following covariates were 
considered potential confounders: 
parental symptoms of ADHD (in 
MoBa, these are measured by the 
6-item World Health Organization 
adult ADHD self-report scale 
screener24 measuring risk for the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition 
classification of ADHD), maternal 
self-reported alcohol use during 
pregnancy, maternal self-reported 
daily smoking during pregnancy, 
symptoms of anxiety and depression 
at the 18th and 30th week of 
gestation (in MoBa, this is measured 
by the 5- and 8-item short version 
of the Hopkins Symptom Checklist 
25), 
25, 
 
26 maternal education, marital 
status, BMI at the 18th week of 
gestation, maternal age, parity, birth 
year centered to 1999, and birth 
year squared to adjust for nonlinear 
cohort effects. Maternal age and 
parity were obtained from the 
Medical Birth Registry of Norway.27 
In addition, we assessed 128 medical 
conditions at the 17th week and 30th 
week of gestation and at 6 months 
postpartum. Acetaminophen was 
used for 96 of these indications.
statistical analyses
The associations between 
acetaminophen use and offspring 
ADHD were examined in Cox 
proportional hazard models with the 
offspring’s age in months as the time 
metric. Offspring were defined as 
being at risk from 3 years of age and 
were followed to the time of ADHD 
diagnosis or censored at December 
31, 2014. To replace missing values 
on self-reported covariates, we 
used multiple imputation with 50 
imputations28.
For the analysis in which 
we investigated duration of 
acetaminophen use, we used the 
indication nested within each 
mother as our observational unit. 
For example, a mother having used 
acetaminophen for 5 out of the 128 
possible indications at any time 
point during pregnancy contributed 
5 units in the analyses (ie, 1 for 
each indication of use). Because the 
number of days was reported as a 
total across all exposure windows in 
each questionnaire, we adjusted the 
analyses of number of days used for 
number of comedications, use before 
pregnancy, and use after pregnancy 
within each indication. We grouped 
the effects of use across types of 
indications (ie, fever and infections, 
pain conditions, and indication not 
specified). We used a stratified Cox 
model to account for duration of 
acetaminophen use, with indications 
as strata. To account for clustering

Results
The study population included 
112 973 children, of whom 2246 had 
been diagnosed with ADHD. In Fig 1, 
we present the estimated cumulative 
number of expected ADHD events 
across age. We estimated that ∼4% of 
children in MoBa will have an ADHD 
diagnosis at the age of 13 (Fig 1). 
Fifty-two thousand seven-hundred 
and seven (46.7%) women used 
acetaminophen during pregnancy 
(Table 1). Twenty-seven percent 
used acetaminophen in 1 trimester, 
16% in 2 trimesters, and 3.3% in all 3 
trimesters. Maternal preconceptional 
use and use in the first trimester was 
approximately equally associated 
(r = 0.49) with use in the first and 
second trimester (r = 0.56) and use 
in the second and third trimester 
(r = 0.49) (Supplemental Table 4). 
Paternal use was associated with 
maternal preconceptional use and 
use during pregnancy (r = 0.18–0.10) 
(Supplemental Table 4).
Offspring prenatally exposed to 
acetaminophen had an increased 
unadjusted hazard rate of ADHD of 
17%, 39%, and 46% after 1, 2, and 3 
trimesters of exposure, respectively 
(Table 1). These associations were 
not attenuated when we adjusted  
for maternal and paternal use  
before pregnancy (model 1), but they 
were slightly lower after we adjusted 
for parental symptoms of ADHD 
(model 2). In model 3, we adjusted 
for a range of potential confounders 
Supplemental Table 5),  
and the hazard ratios (HRs) for the 
associations between 1, 2, and 3 
trimesters of prenatal acetaminophen 
exposure were 1.07 (95% confidence 
interval [CI] 0.96–1.19), 1.22 (95% CI 
1.07–1.38), and 1.27 (95% CI 0.99–
1.63), respectively. The negative 
control, maternal preconceptual 
use of acetaminophen, had no 
effect on offspring ADHD. Paternal 
preconceptional use had no weaker 
effect than maternal use during 
pregnancy (Table 1).
In Table 2, we present the HRs for 
offspring ADHD by number of days 
of prenatal acetaminophen exposure, 
adjusted for each indication of use 
by stratification. We found that 
use of acetaminophen <7 days was 
negatively associated with offspring 
ADHD. For use >7 days, the HR for 
offspring ADHD increased with the 
number of days exposed. Prenatal 
use of acetaminophen for 29 or 
more days was associated with a 
substantially increased hazard rate of 
ADHD (HR = 2.20; 95% CI 1.50–3.24), 
even after adjusting for indications of 
use by stratification (Supplemental 
Table 6). The associations with  
use of 29 days or more did not differ 
across groups of indications  
(HR = 2.13–2.56). Acetaminophen 
use for fever and infections for 22 
to 28 days was strongly associated 
with ADHD (HR = 6.15; 95% CI 
1.71–22.05). Associations between 
paternal preconceptional use of 
acetaminophen and ADHD are 
presented in Table 3. Short-term 
paternal use was not negatively 
associated with ADHD (HR = 1.10;  
95% CI 0.92–1.30); paternal use  
for 29 days or more was as  
strongly associated with ADHD  
(HR = 2.06; 95% CI 1.36–3.13) as the 
corresponding maternal prenatal use.
DIscussIOn
We found maternal prenatal 
acetaminophen use to be associated 
with a higher hazard rate for 
offspring ADHD, supporting the 
findings of Liew et al13 based on 
Danish registry data. Liew et al13  
did not, however, control for the 
indications for use or ADHD-
related familial factors. In our 
study, the association persisted 
after adjusting for acetaminophen 
use before pregnancy and for 
parental symptoms of ADHD. 
We had the advantage of having 
medication data separately for each 
indication, allowing us to account for 
confounding by each indication in a 
stratified model. Offspring prenatally 
exposed to acetaminophen for 29 
days or more had a twofold HR for 
receiving a clinical diagnosis of ADHD 
from specialist health services. This 
estimate was the same regardless of 
indication (ie, fever and infections

 or pain conditions). Maternal use 
of acetaminophen for <8 days was 
negatively associated with ADHD. 
The association between paternal 
preconceptional acetaminophen 
use and ADHD was similar to the 
association between maternal use 
of acetaminophen during pregnancy 
and ADHD.
The considerable increased rate of 
ADHD associated with long-term 
prenatal exposure to acetaminophen 
(ie, >29 days) is in line with the 
findings of Brandlistuen et al, 
4 who 
also found small associations for 
short-term use and large associations 
for long-term use among discordant 
siblings in a subset of MoBa. Liew et al13  
also found stronger associations by 
increasing number of weeks exposed.
ADHD is highly familial in both 
children and adults.30 We have 
previously found that acetaminophen 
use during pregnancy was associated 
with impulsive personality traits 
in mothers.13 Therefore, our ability 
to adjust for parental symptoms of 
ADHD represents a considerable 
improvement compared to previous 
study designs. With our analyses, 
we showed that the association 
between maternal acetaminophen 
use and ADHD did not appear to be 
strongly confounded by common 
familial (eg, genetic) factors for 
ADHD and use of acetaminophen. 
Researchers in previous studies have 
also suggested common familial risk 
factors for maternal depression and 
offspring disruptive behavior.31, 
 
32 
We examined this by adjusting for 
maternal symptoms of depression, 
but the association remained.
Even after adjusting for indications of 
use, there was still an association  
(HR = 2.20; 95% CI 1.50–3.24) between 
long-term prenatal acetaminophen 
exposure and childhood ADHD. This 
estimate was similar across several 
indications for acetaminophen 
use (fever, infections, and pain 
conditions). This indicates that 
putative confounding factors for 
long-term acetaminophen use and

Two thousand two hundred and forty six children were diagnosed with ADHD by December 31, 2014. All estimates are adjusted for birth year, model 2 is furthermore adjusted for parental ADHD symptoms, and model 3 is furthermore adjusted for 
alcohol use during pregnancy, smoking during pregnancy, symptoms of anxiety and depression during pregnancy, maternal education, marital status, BMI at 17th week of gestation, maternal age, and parity.

 ADHD are not related to the recorded 
indications but are related to 
unmeasured factors.
Maternal preconceptional use  
was not associated with ADHD. 
This is in line with a recent study 
in which researchers found no 
effect of maternal postnatal 
acetaminophen use on maternal 
reports of behavior problems.7 
Furthermore, we found that 
maternal preconceptional use 
was as associated with use during 
the first trimester as use across 
2 trimesters. This supports 
the employment of maternal 
preconceptional use as a negative 
(or specificity) control and is 
consistent with a causal link.
The mechanics of the ADHD effect of 
paternal acetaminophen use before 
pregnancy are unclear. It may be due 
to male germ-line epigenetic effects 
as described in endocrine disruption 
effects of acetaminophen on the 
human testis.15, 
 
16
At least 3 plausible hypotheses are 
proposed to explain the association 
between maternal acetaminophen 
use and ADHD. First, neonatal 
exposure to acetaminophen 
changes the levels of brain-derived 
neurotropic factor in mice and 
results in altered behavior, lowered 
fear responses, and reduced 
learning abilities in adulthood.33 
Brain-derived neurotropic factor 
promotes neuronal survival and 
regulates cell migration, axonal 
and dendritic outgrowth, and 
formation of synapses.33 
– 
35 Second, 
acetaminophen could interfere 
with maternal hormones (such 
as thyroid hormones and sex 
hormones) that are related to fetal 
brain development.5, 
 
15, 
 
36 
–39 Third, 
acetaminophen could interrupt 
brain development by induction of 
oxidative stress, leading to neuronal 
death.4, 
 
40 
– 
42 All of these 3 putative 
mechanisms can be further tested 
in experimental animal studies.

 Our finding that acetaminophen use 
for <8 days is negatively associated 
with offspring ADHD indicates 
that the antipyretic effect could 
be beneficial with regard to fetal 
development.11, 
 
12
We address 3 limitations that 
could have biased the results. First, 
although we were able to stratify on 
each indication of use, long-term use 
within each indication is likely to 
represent a more severe form of the 
disorder. We were not able to adjust 
for the severity of each condition 
indicative of acetaminophen use. 
Second, the ADHD diagnosis was not 
validated in a research clinic but was 
based on a diagnosis registered by 
a specialist in the Norwegian health 
care system. Finally, young parents 
and parents who were smokers are 
underrepresented in MoBa, 
43 which 
may limit generalization of results 
to all children. It has, however, 
previously been shown that although 
estimates of frequencies and means 
were biased because of selective 
participation, selected exposure-
outcome associations did not differ 
between MoBa participants and the 
general Norwegian population.43 
–

cOnclusIOns
Long-term maternal use of 
acetaminophen during pregnancy is 
associated with ADHD in offspring. 
This holds true even after adjusting 
for potential confounders, including 
parental symptoms of ADHD and 
indications of acetaminophen use. 
Although maternal preconceptional 
use was substantially correlated 
with use during pregnancy, only use 
during pregnancy was associated 
with ADHD. However, given that 
paternal use of acetaminophen is also 
associated with ADHD, the causal 
role of acetaminophen in the etiology 
of ADHD can be questioned. We do 
not provide definitive evidence for 
or against a causal relation between 
maternal use of acetaminophen and 
ADHD.
