Abstract
As malignant tumours develop, they interact intimately with their microenvironment and can 
activate autophagy1, a catabolic process which provides nutrients during starvation. How tumours 
regulate autophagy in vivo and whether autophagy affects tumour growth is controversial2. Here 
we demonstrate, using a well characterized Drosophila melanogaster malignant tumour model3,4, 
that non-cell-autonomous autophagy is induced both in the tumour microenvironment and 
systemically in distant tissues. Tumour growth can be pharmacologically restrained using

 autophagy inhibitors, and early-stage tumour growth and invasion are genetically dependent on 
autophagy within the local tumour microenvironment. Induction of autophagy is mediated by 
Drosophila tumour necrosis factor and interleukin-6-like signalling from metabolically stressed 
tumour cells, whereas tumour growth depends on active amino acid transport. We show that 
dormant growth-impaired tumours from autophagy-deficient animals reactivate tumorous growth 
when transplanted into autophagy-proficient hosts. We conclude that transformed cells engage 
surrounding normal cells as active and essential microenvironmental contributors to early tumour 
growth through nutrient-generating autophagy.
To assess autophagy during Drosophila tumour growth, we generated green fluorescent 
protein (GFP)-labelled malignant RasV12scrib−/− eye imaginal disc (EAD) tumours in 
animals carrying the autophagosome marker Atg8a tagged with mCherry (ChAtg8a) under 
the control of its endogenous promoter5,6. These tumours grow and invade the central 
nervous system, eventually killing the host3,4,7. In contrast to RasV12-expressing clones, 
ChAtg8a puncta accumulated strongly in epithelial cells surrounding RasV12scrib−/− tumour 
cells, with only marginal accumulation in the tumour itself (Fig. 1a, b and Extended Data 
Fig. 1a, b).
ChAtg8a structures were readily assigned to autophagic structures by correlative light and 
electron microscopy (Extended Data Fig. 1c) and were not observed in cells deficient in the 
essential autophagy gene atg13, and lysosomal processing of ChAtg8a increased in the 
presence of tumour cells. Together, these data demonstrate that the presence of ChAtg8a 
reflects autophagy activity in this system (Fig. 1c, d; for gel source data, see Supplementary 
Data).
As adult Drosophila tumours have recently been found to induce a cachexia-like response in 
the animal8,9, we assessed whether peripheral organs responded to eye-specific tumours in 
larvae. Upregulation of autophagy was observed in the muscle, fat body and midgut of 
RasV12scrib−/− but not RasV12 tumour-bearing larvae and was lost altogether in atg13-
deficient animals8,9 (Fig. 1e–g and Extended Data Fig. 2a). Taken together, these data show 
that malignant RasV12scrib−/−, but not benign RasV12 tumours lead to local and systemic 
non-cell-autonomous autophagy (NAA).
Oral administration of the autophagy flux inhibitor chloroquine10 led to a significant 
reduction in tumour growth and invasion (Fig. 1h and Extended Data Fig. 2b). Therefore, we 
investigated whether NAA in the microenvironment, distal organs or both may contribute to 
tumour growth. We generated recombinant chromosomes that allowed autophagy to be 
ablated through the induction of atg13 or atg14 deficiency in specific compartments during 
tumour growth (Extended Data Figs 3, 4). RasV12scrib−/− tumours were generated with the 
simultaneous prevention of autophagy: (i) within the tumour only; (ii) in the surrounding 
cell population only; (iii) in both cell populations within the tumour-bearing organ; or (iv) in 
the entire animal.
RasV12scrib−/− tumours overgrew, with most invading into the ventral nerve cord (VNC) by 
day 8 (refs 3, 4, 7) (Fig. 2a, f and Extended Data Fig. 5a). Consistent with previous work, we 
found that preventing autophagy within the tumour caused a moderate, albeit significant,

 reduction in tumour volume11,12, but did not reduce invasion (Fig. 2b, f and Extended Data 
Fig. 5a). By contrast, ablation of autophagy in cells surrounding RasV12scrib−/− clones 
strongly reduced tumour growth and invasion (Fig. 2c, f and Extended Data Fig. 5a). 
Removal of autophagy in both cell populations through the creation of a mutant animal with 
complete loss of function in atg13 reduced tumour volume and invasiveness even further 
(Fig. 2d, f and Extended Data Fig. 5a). In both contexts, tumour growth was rescued by 
complementation with a genomic atg13 construct (Fig. 2e, f and Extended Data Fig. 5b–f). 
Each of these manipulations reduced the elevated cell cycle entry and progression displayed 
by tumour cells (Extended Data Fig. 6a–p), with no marked increase in tumour apoptosis 
(Extended Data Fig. 6q–u). Finally, we induced defective autophagy specifically in the 
tumour-bearing organ through mitotic recombination between the atg14 and atg13, scrib-
carrying chromosome arms. Notably, tumour growth was reduced by a similar extent in this 
organ-specific mutant as in fully mutant atg13 animals, suggesting that the role autophagy 
plays in support of tumour growth is local (Fig. 2g–j). To test this, we rescued atg13 
expression specifically in eye discs (ey3.5-atg13)13 and found that this restored autophagic 
activity and significantly rescued tumour growth in tumour-bearing atg13 mutant animals 
(Fig. 2k and Extended Data Fig. 5g, h). Taken together, these results show that 
RasV12scrib−/− tumours require local NAA for initial tumour growth and expansive invasion 
into neighbouring tissue.
Earlier studies have established that the growth and invasion of RasV12scrib−/− tumours 
involve the TNF–JNK–Fos and IL-6–JAK–STAT cytokine signalling pathways3,14–19. 
RasV12scrib−/− tumours failed to induce NAA in TNF-deficient (egr−/−) animals or when 
JNK activity was blocked in the tumour (Fig. 3a–d and Extended Data Fig. 7b, k), indicating 
that autophagy requires tumour-specific TNF/JNK signalling. Notably, systemic autophagy 
activation remained when JNK signalling was inhibited, suggesting that local and systemic 
control of autophagy are achieved by different mechanisms (Extended Data Fig. 7a).
JNK cooperates with Hippo (encoded by hpo)/Yorkie (encoded by yki)/Scalloped (encoded 
by sd) signalling to drive tumour growth in RasV12scrib−/− animals18. To evaluate the role of 
Hippo signalling, we knocked down the Scrib polarity module component discs large 
(encoded by dlg1) while simultaneously overexpressing RasV12 in half of the eye-antennal 
disc15,20. These tumours phenocopied RasV12scrib−/− tumours, rapidly out-growing the 
neighbouring microenvironmental cells that exhibited robust induction of NAA (Fig. 3e). 
However, JNK inhibition reversed NAA, validating the system for epistasis analysis 
(Extended Data Fig. 7c, l). The overexpression of Ykiact alone recapitulated induction of 
NAA (Extended Data Fig. 7d, k), whereas silencing of either yki or sd in RasV12dlg1RNAi 
tumours reversed overgrowth and NAA (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 7e, l). This does not 
appear to be a consequence of reduced tumour growth, as discs in which tumour burden was 
reduced by expression of dominant negative PI3K (dp110DN) still showed robust NAA 
(Extended Data Fig. 7f, l). The data suggest that the transcriptional target(s) that are required 
for NAA respond both to Yki/Sd and to Fos. Targets of Yki/Sd and Fos include the insulin-
binding antagonist ImpL2, a mediator of organ wasting8,9, and the IL-6-like inflammatory 
cytokines unpaired 1, unpaired 2 and unpaired 3 (ref. 19). Although ImpL2 was neither 
necessary nor sufficient for the induction of NAA, the overexpression of either upd or upd3

 by RasV12 animals induced NAA, suggesting that these cytokines can mediate NAA (Fig. 3g 
and Extended Data Fig. 7g–i, l, m).
To investigate how cytokine signalling may regulate NAA, we inactivated downstream JAK–
STAT signalling in either tumours or the microenvironment specifically. We observed a 
robust NAA response in discs in which microenvironmental signalling was disrupted, but 
this was absent when signalling was inactivated in the tumour (Fig. 3h and Extended Data 
Fig. 7j, m), suggesting that NAA induction involves autocrine signalling.
Assays revealed that RasV12scrib−/− tumours have damaged mitochondria, increased 
mitochondrial mass and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and altered respiration 
(Fig. 3i, j and Extended Data Fig. 8a–f). Experimental mitochondrial ROS generation 
induced by ND75 knockdown was sufficient to trigger autophagy21 (Extended Data Fig. 8g, 
h). Ykiact-induced NAA did not involve increased ROS and the growth of these benign-like 
tumours does not depend on NAA (Extended Data Fig. 8i, j). Inhibition of either JNK or 
JAK–STAT in RasV12scrib−/− tumours reversed ROS accumulation18 (Fig. 3k, l). Thus, high 
levels of ROS and NAA are co-regulated in RasV12scrib−/− tumours and rely on co-
transcriptional changes in Fos-, Yki/Sd- and STAT-mediated mitogenic signalling.
The direct inducer of NAA in this context has still to be defined, but it may not be a single 
factor. Efforts to scavenge ROS by pharmaceutical or genetic means failed to reverse 
RasV12scrib− induced NAA, although scavenger efficacy could not be confirmed. 
Nevertheless, these data suggest that highly proliferative RasV12scrib−/− Drosophila tumours 
are metabolically stressed, produce high levels of ROS and potentially rely on increased 
import of nutrients—as in humans. Indeed, we observed an increase in the import of the 
fluorescently labelled glucose analogue (2-NBDG) in RasV12scrib− tumour cells (Extended 
Data Fig. 8k, l)
Microenvironmental autophagy has been proposed to provide recycled nutrients, including 
amino acids, locally in order to support tumour growth22. If this is the case, then tumour 
growth should be hypersensitive to reduced amino acid import. To test this, we silenced the 
cationic and neutral amino acid transporter slimfast (encoded by slif), the loss of which has 
previously been shown to have minimal effect on proliferation of wild-type cells23. 
Silencing of slif markedly reduced growth of RasV12dlgRNAi tumours, indicating that the 
metabolic demand of tumour cells to sustain growth and proliferation is met, in part, by the 
increased import of amino acids (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 9a).
To investigate whether the requirement of autophagy for tumour growth is permanent and 
reliant on local factors, we performed allograft experiments24. RasV12scrib−/− allografts 
grew into large tumours, with a concomitant increase in control host ChAtg8a processing 
(Extended Data Fig. 9b, c). Tumour growth could be pharmacologically restricted by 
administration of autophagy inhibitors; notably, tumours also grew more poorly in atg14Δ5.2/
atg14EY14568 hypomorphic hosts than in control hosts (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 9d, 
e). This suggests that the autophagy capacity of the host, and not tumour location or original 
tumour environment, determines growth. To investigate whether the lack of tumour growth 
in autophagy-deficient animals is reversible, we transplanted poorly growing

 RasV12atg13−/−scrib−/−//atg13−/− tumours into control or atg14Δ5.2/atg14EY14568 hosts. 
Strikingly, this autophagy-deficient tumour tissue, which grew very poorly in atg13 mutant 
larvae (Fig. 2d), was capable of regrowth and formed large tumours when transplanted into a 
control host (Fig. 4c). By contrast, RasV12atg13−/−scrib−/−//atg13−/− tumours transplanted 
into atg14Δ5.2/atg14EY14568 or atg8 hosts remained smaller (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 
9f). Thus, autophagy-deficient tumours are dormant but can resume growth in an autophagy-
proficient ectopic environment.
Malignant tumour growth induces autophagy, both in the microenvironment and distal 
tissues. Locally, normal epithelial cells are engaged as an active part of the 
microenvironment, supporting tumour proliferation by autophagy. Systemically, autophagy 
in distant organs may support the growth of allografted tumour tissue. Most previous studies 
have focused on the cell-autonomous role of autophagy in Ras-driven malignancies2,11,25. In 
line with these studies, we find that cell-autonomous autophagy supports tumour growth, 
although our experimental model shows that the non-cell-autonomous effects of autophagy 
are much more striking. Our studies are consistent with a model in which early tumours 
concomitantly upregulate the import of nutrients and engage the microenvironment to 
recycle nutrients to support their own growth through autophagy (Fig. 4d). Given the 
conserved pathways studied, similar tumour–microenvironment co-operation may occur in 
human cancers.

Generation of atg14 deletion and genomic rescue stocks
The viable P-element line y1 w67c23; P{EPgy2}atg14EY14568 was used to create small 
deletions in the CG11877/atg14 locus by transposase-mediated imprecise excision. The 
resulting deletion of 1,191 bp in atg14Δ5.2 removed the ATG start site and 2/3 of the coding 
region. Genomic rescue stocks were created using BACs from the P[acman] resources, 
covering the atg13 (CH322-168O18, 21 kbp) or atg14 (CH322-175F03 20 kbp) locus, 
respectively. ΦC31 integrase-mediated transgenesis was used for site-directed integration in 
the cytological site 22A3 (Best Gene), creating the g-atg13 and g-atg14 genomic rescue 
transgenes.
Generation of transgenic ey3.5-Hsp70-DmAtg13
The vector backbone was obtained by cutting pattB with HpaI and XbaI. This PhiC31 
integrase-compatible plasmid utilizes the hsp70 minimal promoter to clone the enhancer 
region; in this case, an eye-specific ‘ey3.5’ fragment (ey3.5-hsp70P from pEy3.5-tTA 
plasmid13 and DmAtg13 from pBluescript-SK-DmAtg13 plasmid (LD09558, DGRC)). 
Fragments were PCR amplified and sub-cloned into the pattB vector using Gibson Assembly 
Master Mix (E2611L, NEB). For eGFP-DmAtg13 rescue fly lines, eGFP coding sequence 
was inserted into pBluescript-SK-DmAtg13. The resulting DmAtg13-eGFP fragment was 
used to generate the pattB-ey3.5-hsp70P-DmAtg13-eGFP construct (further cloning details 
are available upon request). X-chromosome-specific insertions of pattB-ey3.5-hsp70P-
DmAtg13 and pattB-ey3.5-hsp70P-DmAtg13-eGFP were generated with site-directed 
integration by ΦC31 integrase-mediated transgenesis in the cytological site 2A3 (Best 
Gene).
Immunofluorescence microscopy
Third instar eye-antennal discs were dissected in PBS and fixed in 4% pFA for 30 min at 
room temperature. Samples were washed twice with PBX (0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100, 3% 
BSA in PBS) and blocked for 1 h at room temperature. Incubation with the primary antibody 
was performed overnight at 4 °C, followed by two washes in PBX and incubation with 
secondary antibody for 2.5 h at room temperature. Hoechst 33342 (Life technologies, 
H3570, final concentration 5 μg ml−1) and Alexa Fluor-647 Phalloidin (H3572, 1:200) were 
added to stain nuclei and actin, respectively. For systemic autophagy scoring, mid-L3 larvae 
(5 days after 24 h egg lay) were dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 h, 
followed by Hoechst and phalloidin staining. Samples were mounted in Vectashield 
mounting medium (H-1000) and observed with a Zeiss LSM 710 or LSM 780 confocal 
microscope. Antibodies used in this study: phospho-histone 3 (Upstate, rabbit, 1:1,000), 
cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling, rabbit, 1:1,000), Ref(2)P (rabbit, 1:2,000), GFP

 (Invitrogen, rabbit, 1:300), ATPa5 (15H4C4) (Abcam, mouse, 1:1,000). Secondary 
antibodies were from Jackson Immunoresearch (Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 647 and Dy 
649) and Molecular Probes (Alexa Fluor 555).
EdU incorporation
Cephalic complexes including EADs of wandering L3 larvae were dissected in Schneider’s 
medium (Gibco) and allowed to incorporate EdU (5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine; 5 μM) for 10 
min at room temperature followed by fixation in 4% pFA for 30 min. Samples were washed 
and blocked in PBX, EdU-click-iT labelling was carried out according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions (Life Technologies, C-10338). Clones were labelled with anti-GFP antibodies 
overnight.
2-NBDG sugar-uptake assay
EADs of third instar larvae were dissected out and collected in Drosophila larval saline 
(HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.1), 87 mM NaCl, 40 mM KCl, 8 mM CaCl2, 50 mM sucrose and 5 
mM trehalose) on ice. Discs were incubated at room temperature in 0.25 mM 2-(N-(7-
nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)2-deoxyglucose (2-NBDG, Life Lechnologies) for 
15 min, rinsed with larval saline, mounted and imaged immediately.
Dihydroethidium staining
Dihydroethidium (DHE) staining was performed as described previously (http://
www.nature.com/protocolexchange/protocols/414). In brief, EADs of wandering L3 larvae 
were dissected in Schneider’s medium (Gibco) and incubated for 7 min in 30 μM DHE (Life 
Technologies, D11347) at room temperature followed by three 5-min washes in Schneider’s 
medium. Discs were subsequently fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, washed once in 
PBS, mounted and imaged immediately.
Tumour volume analysis, pH3 quantification and relative intensity measurements
Cephalic complexes, including EAD, brain lobes and ventral nerve cord, were dissected at 
day 8 or 10 after 24-h egg lay, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and scored for invasion. 
Representative overview images were taken on a Leica MZ FLIII fluorescence 
stereomicroscope with a Leica DFC420 camera. Subsequently, samples were mounted in 
Vectashield for volume quantification with spacers to avoid squashing of the tissue. 
Confocal z-stacks were recorded with a section thickness of 3 μm. GFP-positive tumour 
volume was calculated from 3D-reconstructions of absolute intensities of confocal z-stacks 
using Imaris 7.6.3 software. Relative clone size was calculated as a ratio of GFP positive 
tissue volume normalized to total disc volume visualized with Hoechst 33342 staining.
Phosphorylated histone 3 was quantified from single confocal sections. Background was 
subtracted (rolling ball radius 15 pixels) and phosphorylated histone 3 spots were 
thresholded automatically using the ‘default’ threshold in Fiji. Particles smaller than 10 
pixels were excluded from analysis. GFP clone area was extracted using rolling ball 
background subtraction (radius 300 pixels) and ‘Li’ thresholding. Phosphorylated histone 3 
spots within GFP clones were extracted with the binary feature extractor. The area of the full 
disc was derived from DNA staining with Hoechst. Images were subjected to background

 subtraction (rolling ball radius 500 pixels) and thresholded with the ‘Li’ threshold. 
Phosphorylated histone 3-positive spots within GFP clones were normalized to total 
numbers of spots and to percentage of GFP-positive tissue area within a disc.
Relative ChAtg8a intensities ratios were calculated by measuring average intensities in 5 
ROIs (70-pixel diameter) within and 5 ROIs outside a clone in single confocal sections. Two 
clones per disc were measured, avoiding the area posterior to the morphogenetic furrow 
because of the developmental autophagy pattern in this region.
Western blotting
Western blotting was carried out according to standard procedures. In total, 20 eye discs or 
15–20 ovaries per gel lane were collected on ice in PBS and EDTA-free protease inhibitor 
cocktail (Roche) and spun down briefly and gently. Supernatant was discarded and pellets 
were resuspended in 1× Laemmli sample buffer (1–1.5 μl per eye disc or ovary). Samples 
were separated on 4–20% mini-PROTEAN TGX gels (Biorad). Primary antibodies used 
were mCherry (Acris, goat, 1:500), β-actin (Sigma, mouse, 1:5,000) and GAPDH (Abcam, 
mouse, 1:1,000) followed by horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies 
(Jackson Immunolabs). Densitometry measurements were carried out in Fiji.
Drug treatment
Drugs were added to standard fly food in the following final concentrations: chloroquine 
(C6628, Sigma) 2.5 mg ml−1, SAR405 15 μM (synthesized by ApexBio). Crosses were 
flipped directly onto the drug-containing medium. Adult female hosts were kept on a yeast-
fortified drug-enriched diet before injection. Yeast was omitted after injection and vials were 
flipped daily.
Allograft assays
Transplantation assays were carried out as previously described24. In brief, young female 
hosts were kept on a yeast-fortified diet for 2 days before injection. Eight-day-old donor 
larvae were washed once in ethanol and four times in Millipore water, then tumours were 
dissected out in PBS. EAD tumour or control tissue were cut into small pieces with a 
scalpel, aspirated into a sharpened glass capillary and injected into the abdomens of hosts 
(Nanoject II, Drummond). Vials were flipped daily. Tumours were dissected out 8–10 days 
after injection and subjected to volume quantification by confocal microscopy.
Electron microscopy
For correlative light and electron microscopy experiments, EADs were dissected in PBS and 
fixed for 1 h on ice in 4% formaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde/0.1 M PHEM (240 mM 
PIPES, 100 mM HEPES, 8 mM MgCl2, 40 mM EGTA; pH 6.9). Chemically fixed eye 
imaginal discs were then embedded in 2% (w/v) low-melting-point (LMP) agarose as 
described previously for C. elegans embryos. A piece of aclar foil was topped with a second 
piece of aclar foil with a 1 cm × 1 cm hole in the middle. A small drop of pre-warmed LMP 
agarose was placed in the middle of this hole. Imaginal eye discs were transferred to the 
LMP agarose and the cavity was covered with a third piece of aclar foil and a glass slide and

 piece of agar containing the EAD was punched out using a biopsy punch and transferred to a 
high pressure freezing carrier. Samples were high pressure frozen using a Leica HPM100, 
and freeze substitution and embedding were performed as follows: sample carriers designed 
for flat embedding were filled with 4 ml of freeze substituent (0.1% (w/v) uranyl acetate in 
acetone) and placed in a temperature-controlled AFS2 (Leica) equipped with an FPS robot 
(Leica). Freeze-substitution occurred at −90 °C for 48 h before the temperature was raised to 
−45 °C over a time span of 9 h. The samples were kept in the freeze substituent at −45 °C 
for 5 h before washing three times with acetone and infiltrated with increasing 
concentrations of Lowicryl HM20 (10%, 25%, 75%; 4 h each). During the last two steps, the 
temperature was gradually raised to −25 °C before infiltration three times with 100% 
Lowicryl (10 h each). Subsequent UV-polymerization occurred for 48 h at −25 °C, for 9 h 
during which the temperature was evenly raised to +20 °C. Polymerization then continued 
for another 24 h at 20 °C. Serial sections (~100 nm) were cut on an Ultracut UCT 
ultramicrotome (Leica) and collected on 200-mesh carbon-coated grids. Samples were 
immediately placed in a water droplet in a glass bottom Mattek dish and observed on a Delta 
Vision Deconvolution microscope (Applied Precision, GE Healthcare) using a 63× objective 
and 2× 2 binning. In order to restore the GFP signal for identification of MARCM clones, 
the grid was placed in a droplet of 0.01 M NaOH (pH 12) instead of water and observed on a 
Delta Vision Deconvolution microscope using a 40× objective and 2× 2 binning. After 
recording the fluorescent GFP signal, the grid was thoroughly washed in water before 
commencing with post-staining for electron microscopy. The position of the fluorescent 
signal relative to the asymmetric centre of the carbon coated grid was later used to find the 
same position in the electron microscope. After recording the fluorescent signal, the grid 
was carefully recovered from the water droplet, poststained for 10 min with 2% uranyl 
acetate in 70% methanol and for 5 min with lead citrate. Sections were observed at 80 kV in 
a JEOL-JEM 1230 electron microscope and images were recorded using iTEM software 
with a Morada camera (Olympus). The fluorescent background signal outlining the tissue 
was used to align the fluorescent image with the electron microscopy image. The overlay of 
the fluorescent image with the electron micrograph was done with Photoshop CS4.
Flow cytometry
For cell cycle profiling, 30–40 third instar EADs per genotype were dissected in PBS and 
dissociated in 500 μl 10× trypsin–EDTA solution (Sigma, T4174) by gentle agitation at 
room temperature for 2 h. Hoechst 33342 (Life Technologies, H3570) was added after 1 h at 
a final concentration of 5 μl ml−1. Trypsin was inactivated with fetal bovine serum (FBS) 
(2%), suspended cells were transferred into a 5-ml polystyrene tube with cell strainer cap 
(Falcon, 352235) and stained with propidium iodide for live–dead cell sorting. For 
mitotracker and mitoSOX measurements, 50–60 third instar EADs per genotype were 
dissected in PBS and dissociated in 1 ml of 10× trypsin–EDTA solution by gentle agitation 
at room temperature for 2 h. Trypsin was inactivated with FBS (2%). The cell suspension 
was centrifuged at 300g for 5 min at room temperature, and the pellet resuspended in 
Schneider’s medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma, 7524). Samples were 
either incubated with 5 μM MitoSOX Red (mitochondrial superoxide indicator, Life 
Technologies, M36008) or 200 nM MitoTracker Deep Red FM (Life Technologies, 
M22426) at room temperature for 15 min followed by a wash. DNA content or fluorescence

 intensity was measured on a BD LSR II flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) and the data 
were analysed using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc.). 10,000 GFP-positive cells were 
analysed for cell cycle profiling, 50,000 cells for Mitotracker and MitoSOX.
Seahorse analysis
Approximately 50–100 third instar EADs per genotype were dissociated in 500 μl trypsin–
EDTA (Sigma, T4174) for 2 h followed by inactivation by FBS (2%). The cell suspension 
was centrifuged at 300g for 5 min at room temperature, and the pellet resuspended in 
Schneider’s medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma, 7524). Cells were passed 
through a cell strainer and run through FACS DiVa cell sorter (Becton Dickinson). 30,000, 
GFP+ (tumour) or GFP− (microenvironment) cells per well were sorted into Cell-Tak 
(Corning) coated 96-well Seahorse plates (Seahorse-bio). Sorting was carried out in 
Schneider’s Drosophila medium (Gibco) that was replaced with Seahorse medium 
supplemented with 2 mM sodium pyruvate, 11 mM glucose and 2 mM L-glutamine (pH 
7.4). Respiration rates were measured using Seahorse XF Cell Mito Stress Test-kit (Seahorse 
Bio) using a Seahorse XFe96 analyser (Seahorse Bioscience).
Statistical analysis and reproducibility
Results are presented as mean ± s.e.m. in scatter plots or bar graphs, which were created in 
GraphPad Prism 5. Data were log-transformed before analysis if necessary to achieve 
approximately normal distribution. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant 
for all datasets. Statistical significance was determined by using one-way ANOVA followed 
by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test for multiple samples. A one-sample t-test was used 
for comparisons to point-normalized data; two-tailed, unpaired t-tests were used for pairwise 
comparisons, Chi-squared test for contingency data. P values are indicated in the figure 
legends when possible (Graph Pad Prism 5 does not provide exact P values for ANOVA with 
Dunnett’s correction). No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. Animals 
were randomized for drug feeding experiments. Sex and age of animals are indicated in the 
respective experiments and Supplementary Information. Investigators were blinded for 
invasion scoring. Sample sizes (n) of animals and number of biological repeats of 
experiments are indicated in the corresponding figure legends. For cell cycle profiling 
(Extended Data Fig. 6a–e) and metabolic analysis by Seahorse (Extended Data Fig. 8f) only 
one representative experiment out of three is shown. Error bars in Extended Data Fig. 8f 
indicate mean ± s.e.m. of 2–4 technical replicates.

by P-element-induced imprecise excision (red). The atg14Δ5.2 null allele lacks the ATG start 
site and approximately two-thirds of the coding region, leading to pupal lethality. The

 Extended Data Figure 4. Verification of reverse MARCM clonal technique for atg13 and atg14
a, Cartoon depicting the genetic basis of the reverse MARCM clonal technique to induce 
labelled tumour cells confronted with autophagy-deficient neighbours. Experimental animals 
are heterozygous for atg13 and the tumour suppressor scrib on homologous sister chromatid 
arms. Mitotic (G2 phase) site-specific recombination at FLP recombination target sites 
(FRT) is induced between sister chromatids by transient tissue-specific expression of the 
dsDNA processing enzyme flipase. Severed chromosome arms can be stoichiometrically re-
annealed with the sister chromatid, leading to simultaneous generation of cells carrying 
either two copies of scrib or atg13 loss-of-function alleles. Upon mitotic recombination, 
scrib−/− mutant cells simultaneously express GFP and oncogenic RasV12 under the control of 
an upstream activating sequence (UAS), driven by tissue-specific expression of the GAL4 
yeast transcription factor. Non-recombined cells and atg13−/− cells do not express GFP or 
RasV12 as GAL4 activity is repressed by the presence of the yeast GAL4 repressor GAL80. 
b, c, Confocal images showing eye antennal discs with GFP-labelled control clones and 
reverse MARCM atg13−/− (b) or atg14−/− (c) clones detected by immunolabelling against

25 discs for each genotype. Scale bars, 50 μm (b, c).

 Figure 4. Malignant tumours are dependent on amino acid import and host autophagy
a, Representative transformed cephalic complexes of RasV12dlgRNAi animals with or 
without knockdown of the amino acid transporter slimfast. n = 15 (RasV12dlgRNAi) and n = 
13 (RasV12dlgRNAislifanti) from three independent experiments. b, Allograft tumour growth 
in hosts raised on control or chloroquine-enriched food at 8 days post injection (DPI). n = 34 
(untreated) and n = 40 (chloroquine). c, RasV12atg13−/−scrib−/−//atg13−/− tissue allografted 
into control and atg14-mutant hosts. n = 14 (ctrl hosts) and n = 16 (atg14Δ15-4/atg14 EY14568 
hosts). d, A schematic summarizing key findings. Autophagy is induced in the epithelial 
microenvironment of RasV12scrib−/− tumours. Transformed cells display mitochondrial 
dysfunction with ROS generation, and require JNK signalling, transcriptional activity of Fos 
and Sd/Yki and cell-autonomous JAK/STAT signalling to elicit NAA, which may provide 
recycled nutrients, such as amino acids (AA) to support tumour growth. Data are mean ± 
s.e.m. of three independent pooled experiments; ***P = 0.0003 (b) and ***P < 0.0001 (c) 
from unpaired two-tailed t-test.
