IMPORTANCE The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA)
and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines both recommend lipid-lowering
treatment for primary prevention based on global risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD).
However, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for statin use have included participants with
specific risk-factor profiles.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the overlap between the ACC/AHA and ESC guideline
recommendations and available evidence from RCTs for statin use in primary prevention
of CVD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We calculated the 10-year risk for hard atherosclerotic
CVD (ASCVD) following the ACC/AHA guideline, 10-year risk of CVD mortality following the
ESC guideline, and we determined eligibility for each of 10 major RCTs for primary prevention
of CVD. Conducted from July 2014 to August 2015, this study included 7279 individuals free
of CVD, aged 45 to 75 years, examined between 1997 and 2008 for the Rotterdam Study, a
prospective population-based cohort.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Proportions of individuals qualifying for lipid-lowering
treatment per guidelines, proportions of individuals eligible for any of the 10 RCTs, overlap
between these groups, and corresponding ASCVD incidence rates.
RESULTS Of the 7279 individuals included in the study, 58.2% were women (n = 4238) and
had a mean (SD) age of 61.1 (6.9) years. The ACC/AHA guidelines would recommend statin
initiation in 4284 participants (58.9%), while the ESC guidelines would in 2399 participants
(33.0%) (overlapping by 95.8% with ACC/AHA). A total of 3857 participants (53.0%) met
eligibility criteria for at least 1 RCT. Recommendations from both guidelines and trial evidence
overlapped for 1546 participants (21.2%), who were at high risk for ASCVD (21.5 per 1000
person-years). A further 1703 participants (23.4%) would be recommended for statins by the
guidelines in the absence of direct trial evidence, while 1176 (16.2%) would have been eligible
for at least 1 trial without being recommended statin treatment by any guideline. Finally, 1719
participants (23.6%) would not be recommended a statin, nor would qualify for any of the
trials. These individuals had low incidence of ASCVD (3.3 per 1000 person-years).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Based on this European population study, ACC/AHA and ESC
prevention guidelines often did not align at the individual level. However, for one-fifth of the
general population, guidelines on both sides of the Atlantic recommend statin initiation, with
trial data supporting the efficacy. There should be no controversy about providing optimal
preventive medication to these individuals.

uidelines on lipid-lowering treatment for primary pre-
vention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) are provided
by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart
Association (ACC/AHA) and the European Society of Cardiol-
ogy (ESC).1-3 The recommendations for lipid-lowering treat-
ment initiation from both guidelines are based on evidence
from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) demonstrating the ef-
ficacy of statins for primary prevention of CVD.4,5 The trial evi-
dence was translated by recommending initiation of treat-
mentforadultswithapredicted10-yearriskforCVDexceeding
a given threshold.1,3 However, global-risk algorithms were
never used as an enrollment criterion for RCTs. Therefore, it
has been argued that risk-based allocation of statins does not
fully reflect the existing evidence.6,7 The degree of overlap and
discrepancy between US and European guidelines in light of
available trial evidence remains unclear.7,8
We aimed to compare recommendations from the latest
ACC/AHA and ESC prevention guidelines with the evidence
from 10 major primary prevention RCTs for statins.
Methods
Study Population and Setting
The study population was derived from the Rotterdam Study,
a Dutch prospective population-based cohort established in
1990.9 For the present analysis conducted from July 2014 to
August2015,weincluded7279participants,aged45to75years.
We excluded participants with prevalent atherosclerotic CVD,
defined as myocardial infarction, coronary or other arterial re-
vascularization procedure, stroke, transient ischemic attack,
orrepeatedprescriptionofnitrates(aproxyforindividualswith
angina pectoris).10-13
The main outcome was incident atherosclerotic cardio-
vasculardisease(ASCVD),composedoffatalandnonfatalmyo-
cardialinfarction,myocardialrevascularization,coronaryheart
disease mortality, and nonhemorrhagic stroke.12,14
Details on the design of the Rotterdam Study, assessment
of cardiovascular risk factors, and outcomes are available in
the eAppendix in the Supplement. The Rotterdam Study com-
plies with the Declaration of Helsinki and has been approved
by the medical ethics committee according to the Wet Bevol-
kingsonderzoek: ERGO (Population Screening Act: Rotterdam
Study),executedbytheMinistryofHealth,Welfare,andSports
of the Netherlands. All participants provided written in-
formed consent to participate in the study and to obtain in-
formation from their treating physicians.
Guideline Recommendations
For each participant, we calculated the 10-year risk for hard
ASCVD following ACC/AHA guidelines and the 10-year risk for
CVD mortality following ESC guidelines. As recommended by
ACC/AHA, we used sex-specific pooled cohort equations for
white individuals, and for ESC guidelines, we used sex-
specific Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) equa-
tions for low-risk countries.15 Next, we created 3 categories fol-
lowing the ACC/AHA and ESC recommendations based on
predictedriskthresholds(eTable1intheSupplement):notreat-
ment, treatment considered, and treatment recommended. Ad-
ditionally, for ACC/AHA only, we created an extra category of
no recommendation, as US guidelines abstain from recommen-
dations for individuals with heart failure and end-stage renal
disease.1
Trial Eligibility
For the statin trial eligibility, we identified 10 primary preven-
tion RCTs, reporting on all-cause mortality and CVD events,
selectedinthemeta-analysisbyBrugtsandcolleagues16(eTable
2 and eTable 3 in the Supplement). Every participant was
checked for eligibility criteria in each of the 10 RCTs (see the
eAppendix in the Supplement for details).
The 10 randomized clinical trials included AFCAPS/
TexCAPS (Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention
Study); ALLHAT LLT (The Lipid-Lowering Trial [LLT] Compo-
nent of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment
to Prevent Heart Attack Trial); ASCOT LLA (Prevention of Coro-
nary and Stroke Events With Atorvastatin in Hypertensive Pa-
tients in the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial, The
Lipid Lowering Arm); ASPEN (The Atorvastatin Study for Pre-
vention of Coronary Heart Disease Endpoints in Non-Insulin-
Dependent Diabetes Mellitus); CARDS (Collaborative Atorva-
statin Diabetes Study); JUPITER (Justification for the Use of
Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosu-
vastatin); MEGA (Management of Elevated Cholesterol in the
Primary Prevention Group of Adult Japanese Study Group);
MRC/BHF (Heart Protection Study of Cholesterol Lowering
With Simvastatin); PROSPER (The Prospective Study of Prava-
statin in the Elderly at Risk); and WOSCOPS (The West of Scot-
land Coronary Prevention Study).
Statistical Analysis
We determined the proportions of the study population who
wouldqualifyforstatintreatmentundertheACC/AHAandESC
guidelines, and these were compared with trial eligibility.
Further, we compared cardiovascular risk factor profiles
of groups with discrepant guideline recommendations.
Key Points
Question How do recommendations from the US and European
guidelines for statin treatment in primary prevention of
cardiovascular disease compare with each other and with available
trial evidence?
Findings Within a large population-based cohort, American
College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines
would recommend 58.9% of the participants to initiate statin
therapy vs 33.0% for European Society of Cardiology guidelines
(95.8% overlap with American College of Cardiology/American
Heart Association). Recommendations from both guidelines and
trial evidence overlapped for 21.2% of the participants, while
23.6% did not qualify for statin treatment under any guideline or
trial.
Meaning There should be no controversy about providing optimal
preventive medication to a substantial part of the population, in
whom guideline recommendations and trial evidence align.

Observed ASCVD incidence rates (IRs) are expressed per 1000
person-years over up to 10 years of follow-up.
Sensitivity analyses are provided in the Supplement, in-
cluding (1) results based on 18 RCTs (including 8 trials that did
not assess clinical CVD event rates) selected in the 2013 Coch-
rane Collaboration review on statins for primary prevention
of CVD (eFigure 2),5 (2) results based on the study population
free of diabetes (eFigure 3), and (3) results based on the study
population not using statins at baseline (eFigure 4).
Results
The mean (SD) age of the participants was 61.1 (6.9) years, and
58.2% were women (n = 4238). Among all participants, 24.7%
were current smokers (n = 1798) and 8.4% had type 2 diabe-
tes (n = 609) (Table 1). A total of 674 participants (9.3%) used
statins at baseline (eFigure 1 in the Supplement).
For the treatment-recommended category, 4284 (58.9%)
and 2399 (33.0%) of the entire study population qualified for
lipid-lowering therapy based on the ACC/AHA 2013 and ESC
2012 guidelines, respectively. Based on the eligibility criteria,
3857 of all participants (53.0%) would have been eligible for
at the least 1 of 10 RCTs (Table 2). Among all 3857 trial eligible
participants, 1 in 3 did not immediately qualify for lipid-
lowering treatment under the US guidelines, and more than
half did not qualify under the European guidelines. A total of
95.8% of 2399 participants qualifying for lipid-lowering treat-
ment by the ESC also qualified under the ACC/AHA recom-
mendations (Figure).

person-years) was observed among trial-eligible individuals
who were not recommended to initiate statins according to
either of the guidelines.
Results did not materially change when the ACC/AHA and
ESC recommendations were compared with the eligibility in
18 trials used in the 2013 review of the Cochrane Collabora-
tion, nor after excluding baseline statin users or individuals
withdiabetes(eFigure2,eFigure3,andeFigure4intheSupple-
ment). Increasing levels of individual cardiovascular risk fac-
torswereassociatedwithincreasedlikelihoodofpositiveguide-
line recommendations on initiation of lipid-lowering therapy
and trial eligibility (eFigure 5 in the Supplement).
Discussion
In this European population-based study of adults aged 45 to
75 years free of CVD, we observed that ESC 2012 guideline rec-
ommendations were highly (95.8%) overlapping with the ACC/
AHA2013guidelines,yettheUSguidelinesrecommendedsub-
stantially more persons for lipid-lowering treatment (58.9%)
as compared with the ESC (33.0%), which is mostly ex-
plained by the lowered treatment threshold in the US guide-
lines. These estimates are very much in line with results from
several observational studies in this field.17-21 Overall, 21.2%
of adults were recommended to initiate a statin based on both
guidelines supported by trial data. However, in individuals
without direct RCT evidence, we noted discrepancies be-
tween the guidelines: a small group (0.8%) at very high risk
(IR, 27.0 per 1000 person-years) was eligible by the ECS but
not ACC/AHA guidelines (Figure). These individuals were sig-
nificantly more likely to have chronic kidney disease and heart
failure, which can be explained by ACC/AHA abstaining from
the recommendations for individuals with heart failure and
end-stagerenaldisease.2Ontheotherhand,12.3%ofthepopu-
lation at high risk (IR, 9.2 per 1000 person-years) was eligible
by the ACC/AHA but not ESC guidelines (Figure). These dis-
crepancies between the guidelines contribute to the ongoing
discussion regarding selection of high-risk individuals and the
translation of the available trial evidence into clinical prac-
tice guidelines for lipid-lowering treatment for primary pre-
vention of CVD. For future iterations of prevention guide-
lines, participating experts from the ACC, AHA, ESC, and other
key global organizations might consider working in unison to
create a homogeneous set of recommendations as has been
done before in other cardiology subspecialties.22,23
Although 16.2% of the studied population (n = 1176) would
notberecommendedforstatintreatmentbyeitherACC/AHAor
ESCguidelinesdespitetheavailabilityofconclusivetrialdatain
these individuals, we observed that such individuals had a low
short-term risk for CVD (Figure). However, given that these in-
dividuals have high-risk features that qualified them for these

eringASCVDriskthresholdsforinitiatingstatintreatmenteven
furtherwouldstillbecost-effective,whilepreventingadditional
CVD events.26,27 Early identification and treatment of persons
with elevated CVD risk factors could be considered even more
cost-effective in the long run as compared with waiting to initi-
ate treatment until absolute short-term risk is elevated.
This study had several limitations. First, 95% of the
Rotterdam Study population is of European ancestry; there-
fore, our findings should be cautiously extrapolated to other
ethnicities. Second, 9.3% of the studied population used stat-
ins; therefore, calculated ASCVD incidence rates might be dis-
proportionally underestimated, especially in the higher-risk
subgroups where statin use was most frequent (eFigure 1 in
the Supplement). Finally, all population-based cohorts involv-
ing active participation are subject to the healthy volunteer
effect,28 thus leading to underestimation of the proportions
of individuals qualifying for lipid-lowering therapy.
Conclusions
We found that discrepancies existed between current CVD pre-
vention guidelines on both sides of the Atlantic and available
trial evidence. Yet, for 1 of 5 adults aged 45 to 75 years, the ACC/
AHA2013guidelines,ESC2012guidelines,andpresenceofRCT
evidence support statin treatment for primary prevention of
CVD. Because improved patient outcomes have been demon-
strated for these individuals, it should be an imperative to en-
sure that they are identified and are offered optimal evidence-
based treatment to reduce the burden of CVD.
