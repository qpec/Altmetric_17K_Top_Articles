The burden of cancers and their variations across the states 
of India: the Global Burden of Disease Study 1990–2016
India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative Cancer Collaborators*
Summary
Background Previous efforts to report estimates of cancer incidence and mortality in India and its different parts 
include the National Cancer Registry Programme Reports, Sample Registration System cause of death findings, 
Cancer Incidence in Five Continents Series, and GLOBOCAN. We present a comprehensive picture of the patterns 
and time trends of the burden of total cancer and specific cancer types in each state of India estimated as part of the 
Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016 because such a systematic compilation is not 
readily available.
Methods We used all accessible data from multiple sources, including 42 population-based cancer registries and the 
nationwide Sample Registration System of India, to estimate the incidence of 28 types of cancer in every state of India 
from 1990 to 2016 and the deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) caused by them, as part of GBD 2016. 
We present incidence, DALYs, and death rates for all cancers together, and the trends of all types of cancers, 
highlighting the heterogeneity in the burden of specific types of cancers across the states of India. We also present the 
contribution of major risk factors to cancer DALYs in India.
Findings 8·3% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 7·9–8·6) of the total deaths and 5·0% (4·6–5·5) of the total DALYs in 
India in 2016 were due to cancer, which was double the contribution of cancer in 1990. However, the age-standardised 
incidence rate of cancer did not change substantially during this period. The age-standardised cancer DALY rate had 
a 2·6 times variation across the states of India in 2016. The ten cancers responsible for the highest proportion of 
cancer DALYs in India in 2016 were stomach (9·0% of the total cancer DALYs), breast (8·2%), lung (7·5%), lip and 
oral cavity (7·2%), pharynx other than nasopharynx (6·8%), colon and rectum (5·8%), leukaemia (5·2%), cervical 
(5·2%), oesophageal (4·3%), and brain and nervous system (3·5%) cancer. Among these cancers, the age-standardised 
incidence rate of breast cancer increased significantly by 40·7% (95% UI 7·0–85·6) from 1990 to 2016, whereas it 
decreased for stomach (39·7%; 34·3–44·0), lip and oral cavity (6·4%; 0·4–18·6), cervical (39·7%; 26·5–57·3), and 
oesophageal cancer (31·2%; 27·9–34·9), and leukaemia (16·1%; 4·3–24·2). We found substantial inter-state 
heterogeneity in the age-standardised incidence rate of the different types of cancers in 2016, with a 3·3 times to 
11·6 times variation for the four most frequent cancers (lip and oral, breast, lung, and stomach). Tobacco use was the 
leading risk factor for cancers in India to which the highest proportion (10·9%) of cancer DALYs could be attributed 
in 2016.
Interpretation The substantial heterogeneity in the state-level incidence rate and health loss trends of the different 
types of cancer in India over this 26-year period should be taken into account to strengthen infrastructure and human 
resources for cancer prevention and control at both the national and state levels. These efforts should focus on the ten 
cancers contributing the highest DALYs in India, including cancers of the stomach, lung, pharynx other than 
nasopharynx, colon and rectum, leukaemia, oesophageal, and brain and nervous system, in addition to breast, lip and 
oral cavity, and cervical cancer, which are currently the focus of screening and early detection programmes.

Introduction
Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally after 
cardiovascular diseases.1 Patients with cancer generally 
have a poorer prognosis in low-income and middle-
income countries, including India, because of relatively 
low cancer awareness, late diagnosis, and the lack of 
or inequitable access to affordable curative services 
compared with patients in high-income countries.2,3 India 
has a population of 1·3 billion spread across 29 states and 
seven union territories, and many of the states are as large 
as other countries, with varying degrees of development, 
population genetics, environments and lifestyles, leading 
to a heterogeneous distribution of disease burden and 
health loss.4 There have been previous attempts to describe 
national-level patterns of cancer burden and epidemiology 
in different parts of India as well as areas of importance 
for cancer control,5–20 but a systematic and comprehensive 
understanding of the magnitude and time trends of all

types of cancers in each state of India is not readily 
available. This is needed to inform action for cancer 
control that is commensurate with the need in each state, 
since delivery of health care is a state subject in India.
The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 
target the reduction of premature mortality from 
non-communicable diseases, which includes cancer, by 
one-third by 2030 through prevention and treatment.21 
The National Cancer Registry Programme in India was 
established in 1981 to generate data on the magnitude 
and patterns of cancer through population-based 
registries.22,23 The number of registries has grown under 
this programme, and other population-based registries 
have also been started in recent years.22 However, many 
populous states have no cancer registries yet, and most 
registries in India are in urban areas, leading to 
difficulties in assessing population-level cancer burden 
trends in all parts of the country.
The India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative is a 
collaboration with the Global Burden of Diseases, 
Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) to produce 
subnational disease burden estimates for India. This 
initiative recently reported the variable health transition 
across the states of India from 1990 to 2016 based on 
analysis done as part of GBD 2016.4,24 Here, we report 
detailed trends of the incidence and health loss due to 
each type of cancer in every state of India from 1990 to 
2016.
Methods
Overview
The India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative recently 
reported the overall trends of diseases, injuries, and risk 
factors from 1990 to 2016 for every state of India.4,24 This 
analysis was done as part of GBD 2016, which estimated 
disease burden due to 333 diseases and injuries and 
84 risk factors in all age groups using all accessible data 
from multiple sources. The India State-Level Disease 
Burden Initiative was supported by the efforts of several 
expert groups and a vast network of collaborators to 
identify and access all available data sources, assess their 
scope and quality for inclusion, and participate in the 
analysis and interpretation of the findings. The Health 
Ministry Screening Committee at the Indian Council of 
Medical Research and the ethics committee of the Public 
Health Foundation of India approved the work of this 
initiative.
Estimation of cancer burden
A detailed description of methods to estimate cancer 
mortality, incidence, prevalence, and disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs), and the analytical approaches used 
in GBD 2016 have been reported elsewhere, and are 
summarised in the appendix (pp 3–16).1,25–29 Briefly, the 
major data inputs to determine cancer mortality in 
India included the nationwide Sample Registration 
System (SRS) cause of death data, the Medically 
Certified Cause of Death data, and 42 population-based 
cancer registries (appendix pp 6–8). SRS verbal autopsy 
cause of death data on 455 460 deaths covering the rural 
and urban populations of every state of India from 
2004 to 2013 were included.4 For states with at least one 
population-based cancer registry, the incidence data 
were trans 
formed to mortality by multiplying incidence 
data with an independently modelled urban or rural 
mortality-incidence (MI) ratio for the respective states. 
Cancer registry data were used as the gold-standard 
against which other data sources (SRS or Medically 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed and publicly available reports for 
estimates of cancer burden across the states of India using the 
search terms “burden”, “cancer”, “cause of death”, “death”, 
“DALY”, “epidemiology”, “incidence”, “India”, “morbidity”, 
“mortality”, “neoplasm”, “prevalence”, and “trends” on 
March 26, 2018, without language or publication date 
restrictions. We found a wide variety of valuable data for cancer 
distribution in India and several states, but no studies that 
comprehensively described incidence, prevalence, mortality, 
and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for all cancer types in 
every state of India over a long period of time.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the first report to produce 
comprehensive estimates of incidence, prevalence, mortality, 
and DALYs for 28 types of cancers in every state of India over 
26 years from 1990 to 2016. This analysis was part of the Global 
Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 that 
assessed all causes of disease burden, using data from all 
accessible sources. This study estimates that while the age-
standardised incidence rate of all cancers considered together 
has not changed substantially in India during this 26-year 
period, the proportion of total disease burden caused by cancers 
has doubled. This study reports the substantial heterogeneity in 
the incidence, mortality, and DALYs of different cancers across 
the states of India and documents that tobacco use is the 
highest contributing risk to cancer burden in India.
Implications of all the available evidence
This systematic and comprehensive description of the 
variations in the distribution and trends of cancer types in 
different parts of the country can serve as a useful reference 
for further planning of prevention and management of 
cancer across India. Additionally, cancer registry coverage 
should increase in rural areas and some large states of India 
that do not currently have registries. More large-scale 
collaborative research is needed to understand the reasons 
behind the changing trends of the different types of cancers 
in India.

Certified Cause of Death data) were compared. If the 
other 
data 
sources 
differed 
substantially 
from 
the registry data, they were excluded.1,30 Because of 
limitations associated with the Medically Certified 
Cause of Death mortality data, these were used only 
when the cancer type was not captured by the SRS 
cause of death data. The combined data for cancer 
mortality were used in a modelling approach (CODEm), 
where an ensemble of plausible models is selected. 
The CoDCorrect algorithm was used to adjust cancer 
subtypes to the parent cause and to adjust the sum of 
predicted deaths from these models for each type of 
cancers in an age–sex–state–year group to be consistent 
with the results from all-cause mortality estimation.
The estimation of cancer incidence was driven by 
registry data from India. The mortality estimates that 
were derived from transformation of incidence data 
using the MI ratios, as noted above, were transformed 
back to incidence after the CODEm and CoDCorrect 
model adjustments.1 10-year cancer prevalence was 
estimated by modelling survival using the MI ratio as a 
surrogate for access to cancer care. Incidence cohorts 
were scaled between a theoretical best and worst case 
survival using the MI ratio scaling factor. Lifetime 
prevalence was only estimated for 10 years post 
incidence1 and for long-term sequelae from procedures 
(mastectomy, laryngectomy, stoma, incontinence cystec-
tomy, and prostatectomy). Disability for each cancer was 
estimated by splitting the prevalence into four sequelae: 
diagnosis and primary treatment, controlled phase, 
metastatic phase, and terminal phase. Each prevalence 
sequela was multiplied with specific disability weights 
to determine years lived with disability (YLDs). We 
computed years of life lost (YLLs) from the age-specific 
mortality estimates and a reference life expectancy for 
that age group. DALYs, a summary measure of total 
health loss, were computed by adding YLLs and YLDs 
for each cancer type for location, year, age and sex.1,28 The 
appendix provides a list of data inputs used for these 
estimations (pp 17–29).
A description of estimation of risk factor exposure and 
its contribution to disease burden in GBD is available 
elsewhere.29 Briefly, this includes determination of risk 
exposure and disease outcome pairs based on available 
evidence and inclusion criteria, assessment of risk 
exposure from all accessible data sources, and estimation 
of disease burden attributable to risks based on published 
relative risks. Estimates of DALYs for specific types of 
cancers that were attributable to each risk factor were 
produced by location, age, sex, and year.
GBD uses covariates, which are explanatory variables 
that have a known association with the outcome of 
interest, to arrive at the best possible estimate of the 
outcome of interest when data for the outcome are scarce 
but data for the covariates are available.25–29 This approach 
was part of the estimation process for the findings 
presented in this report.
Analysis presented in this paper
The findings are reported for 31 geographical units in 
India: 29 states, Union Territory of Delhi, and the union 
territories other than Delhi (combining the six smaller 
union territories of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, 
Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and 
Diu, Lakshadweep, and Puducherry). The states of 
Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, and Jharkhand were created 
from existing larger states in 2000, and the state of 
Telangana was created in 2014. For trends from 1990 
onwards, the data for these four new states were 
disaggregated from their parent states on the basis of 
data from the districts that now constitute these states. 
The findings are also presented for four groups of states 
based on epidemiological transition level (ETL) as 
described previously.4 Briefly, the ETL state groups 
were defined on the basis of the ratio of DALYs 
from communicable, maternal, neonatal and nutritional 
diseases to those from non-communicable diseases 
and injuries combined in 2016, with a relatively lower 
ratio indicating higher ETL: low level ETL state 
group (ratio 0·56–0·75), lower-middle ETL state group 
(0·41–0·55), higher-middle ETL state group (0·31–0·40), 
and high ETL state group (less than 0·31). We have 
reported previously that epidemiological transition 
ratios of the states of India have a significant inverse 
relation with the Socio-demographic Index calculated by 
the GBD study and based on income, education, and 
fertility levels, which indicates broad correspondence of 
ETL groups with sociodemographic development 
levels.4
We present trends of incidence (new cases in a year), 
mortality, and DALYs due to all cancers together and 
different types of cancers from 1990 to 2016 for every 
state of India. We regarded DALYs as the main metric for 
disease burden because it includes both mortality and 
morbidity and is recommended by the National Health 
Policy of India for tracking disease burden.31 First, we 
present the 1990 to 2016 trends for the overall burden 
from all cancers together in terms of DALYs, followed 
by incidence and deaths. We describe the trends of 
ten cancer types that are responsible for the highest 
proportion of cancer DALYs in India in 2016. We also 
describe briefly another six cancer types that are among 
the ten leading incident cancers in females or males in 
India in 2016, which are not included in the previous 
ten cancers causing the highest DALYs. We present the 
age distribution of DALYs due to types of cancers. We also 
highlight relevant differences between females and 
males in the distribution of cancers. We present briefly 
findings related to the major risk factors contributing to 
cancer DALYs in India as estimated by GBD.
The estimates were produced initially for each state. 
We then computed the population-weighted mean of 
these state estimates as the estimate for India. 
We present both crude and age-standardised rates, since 
crude rates provide the actual situation in each state that

is preferred by policy makers, and age-standardised rates 
allow comparisons over time and between states after 
adjusting for the differences in the age structure of the 
population. We based age-standardised rates on the 
GBD global reference population.25 We report estimates 
with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) where relevant. 
These were based on 1000 runs of the models for each 
quantity of interest, with the mean considered as the 
point estimate and the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles 
considered as the 95% UI (appendix p 15).25–28

Results
All cancers together contributed 5·0% (95% UI 4·6–5·5) 
of the total DALYs and 8·3% (7·9–8·6) of the total deaths 
in India in 2016, an increase of 90·9% and 112·8% 
respectively from 1990. The crude cancer DALY rate in 
India increased by 25·3% (16·8–34·2) from 1990 to 2016, 
but the age-standardised cancer DALY rate did not 
change substantially during the same period.32 The age-
standardised cancer DALY rate had a 2·6 times variation 
across the states of India in 2016 (appendix p 30). The 
highest crude cancer DALY rates in 2016 were in 
the states of Mizoram, Kerala, Assam, Haryana, and 
Meghalaya, and the highest age-standardised rates were 
in the northeast states of Mizoram, Meghalaya, Arunachal 
Pradesh, and Assam (appendix p 30).
The estimated number of incident cancer cases in 
India increased from 548 000 (95% UI 520 000–576 000) 
in 1990 to 1 069 000 (1 043 000–1 101 000) in 2016 
(appendix p 31). The crude cancer incidence rate in India 
increased by 28·2% (95% UI 19·9–35·5) from 63·4 per 
100 000 in 1990 to 81·2 per 100 000 in 2016, but there 
was no change in the age-standardised incidence rate 
(appendix p 32). Crude cancer incidence rate was highest 
in Kerala and Mizoram, followed by Haryana, Delhi, 
Karnataka, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and 
Assam (figure 1, appendix p 30). Age-standardised 
incidence rates were highest in the northeast states of 
Mizoram, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, and Assam,

and in Delhi and Haryana. Crude cancer incidence rate 
increased substantially from 1990 to 2016 in all ETL state 
groups, with the highest increase in the high ETL group 
(appendix p 32).
The number of deaths due to cancer in India increased 
from 382 000 (95% UI 351 000–412 000) in 1990 to 813 000 
(767 000–850 000) in 2016 (appendix p 31). The crude 
cancer death rate in India in 2016 was 61·8 (95% UI 
58·3–64·6) per 100 000, as compared with 44·2 
(40·6–47·7) in 1990 (appendix p 32). Male cancer patients 
had a 12·3% (95% UI 2·9–23·3) increase in age-
standardised death rate over the 26-year time period, 
whereas no substantial changes over time were found in 
female cancer patients (appendix p 32). There was no 
significant difference between the ETL state groups for 
the crude death rate in 2016 (appendix p 32). The crude 
death rate for both sexes combined was highest in 
Mizoram, Kerala, and Haryana in 2016, followed by 
Assam, Karnataka, Odisha, Uttarakhand, Meghalaya, 
and Himachal Pradesh (appendix pp 30, 33). The age-
standardised death rates were highest in the northeast 
states of Mizoram, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, and 
Assam (appendix p 30).
The crude cancer MI ratio in India in 2016 was 0·76 
(95% UI 0·72–0·79). The MI ratio was higher in low 
and lower-middle ETL state groups than the high and 
higher-middle ETL groups in 2016 (figure 2). The overall 
MI ratio was significantly higher in males (0·83; 95% UI 
0·81–0·85) than females (0·69; 0·64–0·71) in 2016. The 
MI ratio for males was more than 0·80 in all states from 
the low ETL group and most of the lower-middle ETL 
states, with a higher ratio in Odisha in low ETL, and 
Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh in the lower-middle 
ETL state group in 2016. The MI ratio was below 0·80 for 
females in most of the states in India in 2016, except for 
Bihar and Meghalaya.
The leading types of cancer in India in 2016, those 
responsible for more than 5% of the total cancer DALYs 
among both sexes combined, were stomach cancer 
(9·0%), breast cancer (8·2%), lung cancer (7·5%), lip and 
oral cavity cancer (7·2%), pharynx cancer other than 
nasopharynx (6·8%), colon and rectum cancer (5·8%), 
leukaemia (5·2%), and cervical cancer (5·2%; figure 3). 
Stomach cancer was responsible for the highest DALYs 
among all cancers in India in both 1990 and 2016 
(figure 4). The age-standardised DALY rate increased 
significantly in India from 1990 to 2016 for liver cancer 
(51·2%; 95% UI 24·0–65·9), non-Hodgkin lymphoma 
(35·4%; 20·7–48·8), ovarian cancer (28·1%; 15·1–44·3) 
and myeloma (28·2%; 5·6–63·1). The reduction in

age-standardised DALY rates from 1990 to 2016 was 
highest for testicular cancer (59·2%; 53·8–65·4) and 
Hodgkin’s lymphoma (54·8%; 39·6–62·5), followed 
by cervical (38·7%; 23·0–56·3), nasopharynx (33·5%; 
19·8–46·1), larynx (31·6%; 25·7–36·7), uterine (31·5%; 
17·8–40·0), and stomach cancer (31·4%; 23·7–37·3). 
Among females, breast, cervical, and stomach cancer 
were responsible for the highest DALYs in 2016. The 
highest cancer DALYs among males in India in 2016 were 
due to lung cancer, followed by lip and oral cavity cancer, 
other pharynx cancer, and stomach cancer (figure 3).
Among both boys and girls aged 0–14 years, leukaemia 
was responsible for the highest DALYs in India in 2016, 
followed by brain and nervous system cancer (figure 5, 
appendix pp 34–40). Breast and cervical cancer DALY 
rates in females increased after the age of 30 years and 
dropped after the age of 60 years in 2016. DALY rates for 
lung cancer and stomach cancer increased in males after 
the age of 35 years in 2016, while prostate cancer 
increased after the age of 50 years.
Tobacco use, alcohol use, and dietary risks were 
estimated by GBD to contribute the highest cancer DALYs 
in 2016; they were responsible for 10·9%, 6·6% and 6·0% 
of the total cancer DALYs, respectively (appendix pp 41–42).
Stomach cancer
The estimated number of incident stomach cancer cases 
in India in 2016 was 75 000 (95% UI 73 000–78 000) 
and the prevalent cases were 112 000 (109 000–116 000; 
appendix p 31). There was a substantial reduction in 
the age-standardised incidence rate of stomach cancer 
(39·7%; 95% UI 34·3–44·0) from 1990 to 2016 in India 
(figure 6). Stomach cancer was the fourth leading incident 
cancer in females and males in India in 2016 (appendix 
pp 49, 50). The age-standardised incidence rate for 
stomach cancer in 2016 varied 11·5 times across the states 
of India (appendix pp 43–48). Stomach cancer is the only 
cancer type for which decreasing rates were estimated in 
all states across the country; a decrease greater than 50% 
was estimated in Uttarakhand, Sikkim, Delhi, Jammu and

Kashmir, and Himachal Pradesh among females, and in 
Maharashtra among males (appendix pp 51–54). There 
was a 13·1 times difference between the highest and 
lowest state-specific DALY rates for stomach cancer 
(figure 7). The crude DALY rate was highest in Mizoram, 
Arunachal Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir. In 2016, 
stomach cancer was the first or second highest cause of 
cancer deaths in 15 states for females and in 18 states for 
males (figure 8). Only a small proportion of the stomach 
cancer DALYs in India in 2016 could be attributed to risk 
factors included in GBD (dietary risks [4·1%] and smoking 
[3·5%]; appendix pp 41–42).
Breast cancer
The estimated number of incident breast cancer cases in 
India in 2016 was 118 000 (95% UI 107 000–130 000), 98·1% 
of which were in females, and the prevalent cases were 
526 000 (474 000–574 000; appendix p 31). Breast cancer is 
the leading cancer in Indian females, accounting for the 
largest crude incidence rate and prevalence of any cancer 
type (appendix pp 49, 50). Over the 26-year period, the age-
standardised incidence rate of breast cancer in females 
increased by 39·1% (95% UI 5·1–85·5) from 1990 to 2016, 
with increase observed in every state of the country 
(appendix pp 51). The age-standardised incidence rate of 
breast cancer varied 3·2 times in females across the states 
of India in 2016 (appendix pp 43–48). The crude incidence 
and DALY rates of breast cancer were highest in the high 
ETL state group (figure 7). There was a 4·1 times difference 
between the highest and lowest state-specific DALY rates 
for breast cancer in 2016. The highest crude DALY rates for 
breast cancer were in Kerala, Punjab, and Tamil Nadu in 
the high ETL state group, followed by Delhi, Maharashtra, 
Karnataka, and Haryana in the higher-middle ETL group. 
Breast cancer was the first or second leading cause of 
cancer deaths among females in 28 Indian states in 2016 
(figure 8). Only a small proportion of breast cancer DALYs 
in India in 2016 could be attributed to risk factors included 
in GBD (high fasting plasma glucose [4·9%] and 
secondhand smoke [2·4%]; appendix pp 41–42).
Lung cancer
We refer to tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer as lung 
cancer in this report for simplicity. The number of

incident lung cancer cases in India in 2016 was 67 000 
(95% UI 63 000–72 000), 72·2% of which were in males, 
and the prevalent cases were 74 000 (70 000–80 000; 
appendix p 31). This cancer was the second most 
common incident cancer among males in 2016 (appendix 
pp 49–50). The age-standardised incidence rate of lung 
cancer varied 8 times in both sexes combined across the 
states of India in 2016 (appendix pp 43–48). The crude 
lung cancer incidence rate in males was highest in 
Kerala and Mizoram, and in females was highest in 
Mizoram and Manipur (appendix pp 49, 50). There was 
a 6·3 times  difference between the highest and lowest 
state-specific crude DALY rates for lung cancer in 2016 
(figure 7). The crude DALY rate for lung cancer in 2016 
was highest in Mizoram, followed by Kerala, Manipur, 
and Jammu and Kashmir. Lung cancer was the first or 
second leading cause of cancer deaths in 19 states for 
males and four states for females in 2016 (figure 8). 
Tobacco use and air pollution were the leading risk 
factors in GBD for lung cancer in India in 2016 to which 
43·2% and 43·0% of the lung cancer DALYs could be 
attributed, respectively (appendix pp 41, 42).

in India in 2016 was 113 000 (95% UI 106 000–118 000) 
and the prevalent cases were 397 000 (371 000–412 000; 
appendix p 31). There was a substantial reduction in the 
age-standardised incidence rate of lip and oral cavity 
cancer (6·4%; 95% UI 0·4–18·6) from 1990 to 2016 in 
India (figure 6). Lip and oral cavity cancer was the most 
common incident cancer in males in India in 2016 
(appendix p 50). The crude incidence rate was sub-
stantially higher in males than in females (appendix 
pp 49, 50). The age-standardised incidence rate for lip 
and oral cavity cancer varied 5·1 times among both 
sexes combined across the states of India in 2016 
(appendix pp 43–48). The crude incidence and DALY 
rates of lip and oral cavity cancer were highest in the 
lower-middle ETL state group (figure 7). There was a 
5·5 times difference between the highest and lowest 
state-specific DALY rates for lip and oral cavity cancer 
in 2016. The highest DALY rate for lip and oral cavity 
cancer was in Madhya Pradesh, followed by Gujarat and 
Kerala. Lip and oral cavity cancer was the first or second 
leading cause of cancer deaths in seven Indian states 
for males in 2016 (figure 8). Smokeless tobacco, alcohol 
use and smoking were the leading risk factors in 
GBD for lip and oral cavity cancer in India in 2016 to 
which 33·2%, 29·8%, and 20·9% of the  lip and oral 
cavity cancer DALYs could be attributed, respectively 
(appendix pp 41, 42).
Pharynx cancer other than nasopharynx
The number of incident pharynx cancer other than 
nasopharynx cases in India in 2016 was 65 000 (95% UI 
58 000–70 000), 70·2% of which were in males, and the 
prevalent cases were 152 000 (137 000–163 000; appendix 
p 31). The age-standardised incidence rate for other 
pharynx cancer varied 9·8 times for both sexes combined 
across the states of India in 2016 (appendix pp 43–48). 
The DALY rate for other pharynx cancer was higher in 
the low ETL state group than the other ETL groups 
(figure 7). There was a 9·3 times difference between the 
highest and lowest state-specific DALY rates for other 
pharynx cancer in 2016. The DALY rate for other pharynx 
cancer was highest in Haryana, followed by Karnataka,

Meghalaya, Assam, Rajasthan, and Himachal Pradesh. 
Other pharynx cancer was the first or second leading 
cause of cancer deaths among males in 11 Indian states 
in 2016 (figure 8). Alcohol use was the leading risk factor 
in GBD for other pharynx cancer in India in 2016 to 
which 30.1% of the other pharynx cancer DALYs could be 
attributed (appendix pp 41, 42).
Colon and rectum cancer
The number of incident colon and rectum cancer cases 
in India in 2016 was 63 000 (95% UI 58 000–66 000) 
and the prevalent cases were 185 000 (171 000–195 000; 
appendix p 31). Colon and rectum cancer incidence 
rate in both sexes was higher in the high ETL as compared 
with other ETL state groups (appendix pp 49, 50). The 
age-standardised incidence rate for colon and rectum 
cancer varied 1·9 times across the states of India in 2016 
(appendix pp 43–48). There was a 2·5 times difference 
between the highest and lowest state-specific DALY rates 
for colon and rectum cancer in 2016 (figure 7). The 
highest DALY rate for colon and rectum cancer 
was in Odisha, followed by Kerala, Mizoram, and Uttar 
Pradesh. Colon and rectum cancer was the third to fifth 
leading cause of cancer deaths in 24 states for females 
and 16 states for males (figure 8). Dietary risks were the 
leading risk factor in GBD for colon and rectum cancer 
in India in 2016 to which 43·2% of the colon and rectum 
cancer DALYs could be attributed (appendix pp 41, 42).
Leukaemia
The number of incident leukaemia cancer cases in 
India in 2016 was 34 000 (95% UI 30 000–38 000) and 
the prevalent cases were 105 000 (96 000–120 000; 
appendix p 31). The age-standardised incidence rate of 
leukaemia decreased substantially by 16·1% (95% UI 
4·3–24·2) in India from 1990 to 2016 (figure 6). Among 
children aged 0–14 years, leukaemia was responsible for 
the highest proportion of the cancer DALYs (34·6%) in 
India in 2016, which was similar among boys and girls 
(figure 5, appendix pp 34–40). The age-standardised 
incidence rate for leukaemia varied 2·2 times across the 
states of India in 2016 (appendix pp 43–48). The crude 
DALY rate for leukaemia was similar across the ETL state 
groups in 2016 (figure 7). The states with the highest 
DALY rate for leukaemia were Delhi and Punjab. There 
was a 2·5 times difference between the highest and 
lowest state-specific DALY rates for leukaemia. In males, 
leukaemia was the third and fifth leading cause of cancer 
deaths in Delhi and Punjab respectively in 2016, but 
lower in other states (figure 8).
Cervical cancer
Cervical cancer was the second most common cancer 
in females in India in 2016, with 77 000 (95% UI 
68 000–96 000) incident cervical cancer cases in India in 
2016 and 288 000 (247 000–342 000) prevalent cases 
(appendix p 31). The age-standardised incidence rate of 
cervical cancer decreased substantially by 39·7% (95% UI 
26·5–57·3) in India from 1990 to 2016 (figure 6). The 
age-standardised incidence rate for cervical cancer varied

2·8 times in females across the states of India in 2016 
(appendix pp 43–48). There was a 3·4 times  difference 
between the highest and lowest state-specific DALY rates 
for cervical cancer (figure 7). The DALY rate for cervical 
cancer in 2016 was highest in Karnataka, followed 
by Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, and 
Maharashtra. Cervical cancer was the second leading 
cause of cancer deaths for females in 12 Indian states 
(figure 8). Unsafe sex was estimated to contribute to all of 
the cervical cancer DALYs in GBD in India in 2016 
(appendix pp 41, 42). It is important to note that other 
unknown risk factors could also be contributing to 
cervical cancer as the population-attributable fractions of 
different risks can add up to more than 100%.

Oesophageal cancer
The number of incident oesophageal cancer cases in 
India in 2016 was 37 000 (95% UI 36 000–38 000), 60·8% 
of which were in males, and the prevalent cases were 
41 000 (39 000–42 000) (appendix p 31). There was a 
substantial reduction in the age-standardised incidence 
rate of oesophageal cancer (31·2%; 95% UI 27·9–34·9) 
in India from 1990 to 2016 (figure 6). The age-standardised 
incidence 
rate 
for 
oesophageal 
cancer 
varied 
34 times across the states of India in 2016 (appendix 
pp 43–48). There was a 33·8 times difference between 
the highest and lowest state-specific DALY rates for 
oesophageal cancer (figure 7). The DALY rate for 
oesophageal cancer was highest in the north-east 
states of Meghalaya, Assam, Mizoram, and Nagaland. 
Oesophageal cancer was the first or second leading 
cause of cancer deaths in two states for females and 
six states for males (figure 8). Smokeless tobacco, dietary 
risks, and smoking were the leading risk factors in GBD 
for oesophageal cancer in India in 2016 to which 22·6%, 
21·5%, and 17·4% of the oesophageal cancer DALYs 
could be attributed, respectively (appendix pp 41, 42).
Brain and nervous system cancer
The number of incident brain and nervous system cancer 
cases in India in 2016 was 23 000 (95% UI 21 000–28 000) 
and the prevalent cases were 49 000 (44 000–57 000; 
appendix p 31). The age-standardised incidence rate for 
brain and nervous system cancer varied 2·1 times across 
the states of India in 2016 (appendix pp 43–48). Among 
children aged 0–14 years, brain and nervous system 
cancer was responsible for the second highest proportion 
of the cancer DALYs (16%) in India in 2016, which 
was similar among boys and girls (figure 5, appendix 
pp 34–40). There was a 2·6 times difference between the 
highest and lowest state-specific DALY rates for brain and 
nervous system cancer (figure 7). The DALY rate for brain 
and nervous system cancer was highest in Delhi followed 
by Sikkim. The ranking of deaths due to brain and 
nervous system cancer was relatively low in all states as 
compared with the other high burden cancers (figure 8). 
Prostate cancer
Prostate cancer had the fifth highest incidence rate 
among males in India in 2016 (4·8 per 100 000, 95% UI 
3·8–5·8), with 33 000 (26 000–40 000) incident cases 
and 112 000 (87 000–137 000) prevalent cases (appendix 
pp 31, 50). The age-standardised incidence rate of pro-
state cancer increased substantially by 29·8% (95% UI 
8·5–46·9) from 1990 to 2016 (figure 6). This rate varied 
2·4 times across the states of India in 2016 (appendix 
pp 43–48). The crude incidence rate for prostate cancer 
was highest in Kerala (appendix p 50). 
Larynx cancer
Larynx cancer had the seventh highest incidence rate 
among males in India in 2016 (3·8 per 100 000, 95% UI 
3·7–4·0). There were 31 000 (95% UI 30 000–33 000) 
incident cases in India, of which 83·5% were in males, 
and there were 96 000 (93 000–100 000) prevalent cases 
(appendix pp 31, 50). The age-standardised incidence rate 
of larynx cancer in India decreased significantly by 31·4% 
(95% UI 27·6–35·3) from 1990 to 2016 (figure 6). This rate 
varied 3·3 times across the states of India in 2016 (appendix 
pp 43–48). The crude incidence rate for larynx cancer in 
males was highest in Kerala in 2016, followed by Delhi, 
Haryana, and Assam (appendix p 50). Smoking and 
alcohol use were the leading risk factors in GBD for larynx 
cancer in India in 2016 to which 37·9% and 17·2% of the 
larynx cancer DALYs could be attributed, respectively 
(appendix pp 41, 42).
Liver cancer
Liver cancer had the ninth highest incidence rate among 
males in 2016 in India (3·1 per 100 000, 95% UI 2·9– 3·2). 
There were 30 000 (95% UI 29 000–32 000) incident 
cases in India, of which 68·9% were in males, and 
12 000 (11 000–14 000) prevalent cases (appendix pp 31, 50). 
The age-standardised incidence rate of liver cancer 
increased substantially by 32·2% (95% UI 11·4–41·3) 
from 1990 to 2016 (figure 6). This rate varied 
7·9 times across the states of India in 2016 (appendix 
pp 43–48). The crude incidence rate for liver cancer in 
males in 2016 was highest in Arunachal Pradesh, 
followed by Kerala, Sikkim, and Mizoram (appendix 
p 50). In 2016, of the total liver cancer DALYs in India, 
11·7% could be attributable to alcohol use in GBD 
(appendix pp 41, 42). 
Ovarian cancer
Ovarian cancer had the sixth highest incidence 
rate among females in 2016 in India (4·0 per 100 000, 
95% UI 3·7–4·3), with 26 000 (95% UI 24 000–27 000) 
incident cases and 76 000 (69 000–80 000) prevalent cases 
(appendix pp 31, 49). The age-standardised incidence 
rate of ovarian cancer increased substantially by 28·6% 
(95% UI 19·2–41·6) from 1990 to 2016 (figure 6). This 
rate varied 3·7 times across the states of India in 2016 
(appendix pp 43–48). The crude incidence rate was 
highest in Kerala, followed by Delhi, Arunachal Pradesh, 
and Punjab (appendix p 49). Only a small proportion of 
the ovarian cancer DALYs in India in 2016 could be 
attributed to risk factors included in GBD (high fasting 
plasma glucose [5·5%]; appendix pp 41, 42).
Gallbladder and biliary tract cancer
Gallbladder and biliary tract cancer had the ninth highest 
incidence rate among females in 2016 in India (2·6 per 
100 000, 95% UI 2·3–2·8). There were 26 000 (95% UI 
23 000–29 000) incident cases in India, of which 64·4% 
were in females, and there were 21 000 (18 000–23 000) 
prevalent cases (appendix pp 31, 49). This rate varied 
5·9 times across the states of India in 2016. The crude 
incidence of gallbladder and biliary tract cancer in females

was highest in the states of Assam and Delhi in 2016 
(appendix p 49). 9·1% of the gallbladder and biliary tract 
cancer DALYs in India in 2016 could be attributed to high 
body-mass index in GBD (appendix pp 41, 42).
Thyroid cancer
Thyroid cancer had the tenth highest incidence rate 
among females in 2016 in India (2·5 per 100 000, 95% UI 
2·3–2·6). There were 21 000 (95% UI 20 000–23 000) 
incident cases in India, of which 74·3% were in females, 
and there were 106 000 (101  000–115 000) prevalent cases 
(appendix pp 31, 49). The age-standardised incidence rate 
of thyroid cancer increased substantially by 25·6% 
(95% UI 12·6–52·3) from 1990 to 2016 (figure 6). This rate 
varied 6·1 times across the states of India in 2016 
(appendix pp 43–48). The crude incidence rate of thyroid 
cancer was highest in females in Kerala, followed by 
Sikkim, Nagaland, and Goa in 2016 (appendix p 49). 
Only a small proportion of the thyroid cancer DALYs in 
India in 2016 could be attributed to risk factors included in 
GBD (high body-mass index [5·1%]; appendix pp 41, 42).
Discussion
The number of new cases and deaths due to cancer 
doubled in India from 1990 to 2016, as did the pro-
portional contribution of cancers to the total DALYs and 
deaths in the country. The crude incidence, mortality, 
and DALYs from cancer increased substantially over the 
26-year time period. However, there was no change in 
the age-standardised rates for both sexes combined, 
highlighting the contribution of ageing and population 
growth to the increasing cancer burden of the country. 
The age-standardised death rate for cancer increased for 
males during this period, suggesting differences by sex. 
Males had higher MI ratios than females in every state of 
the country.
The trends observed in sex-specific and cancer type-
specific incidence rates over time in India are likely due to 
a variety of factors, such as population ageing, changes in 
cancer literacy, detection, health-care access, and a variety 
of risk factors. We highlight some of the key risk factors 
that are associated with the highest burden of cancers in 
India. The substantial decrease in the age-standardised 
incidence rate of stomach cancer across the country 
might be due to lifestyle changes such as reduced 
consumption of salt-preserved foods, better availability of 
refrigeration, and increasing fruit con 
sumption, and to 
decreases in smoking prevalence.32–34 The prevalence of 
Helicobacter pylori remains persistently high in Indians,35 
and hence this is an unlikely factor in the decreasing 
incidence of stomach cancer. For breast cancer, a 
substantial increase in age-standardised incidence rate is 
consistent with changes in some risk factors over time in 
India, such as later age at first birth, lower parity, and 
increase in overweight and obesity.32,36,37 The substantial 
decrease in the age-standardised incidence rate of 
oesophageal cancer might be partly due to the decrease 
in smoking prevalence over the 26-year period and in 
smokeless tobacco use over the past 10 years.32,34 The 
absence of change in the age-standardised incidence rate 
of lung cancer in India might be related to the mixed 
trends of its major risk factors, which include decrease in 
smoking and household air pollution but an increase in 
ambient air pollution, but also due to the patterns of other 
unknown risk factors.32,34 The small decrease in the 
age-standardised incidence rate of lip and oral cavity 
cancer in India could be related to the reduction in use of 
smokeless tobacco in India during the past decade.32 
The decreasing age-standardised incidence rate of cervical 
cancer could be inversely related to the reproductive risk 
factors mentioned for breast cancer increase above.36 
In the absence of systematic human papilloma virus 
(HPV) testing in India, there is no evidence of changing 
seroprevalence of HPV and its subtypes over time in 
India. Leukaemia has been associated with genetic, 
infectious, and environmental risks,38 but the reasons for 
the substantial reduction in its age-standardised incidence 
rate in India from 1990 to 2016 are unclear.
The interplay of the trends of the two risk factors to 
which the highest proportion of cancer DALYs in India 
could be attributed, tobacco and alcohol, is interesting in 
relation to the trends of some of the leading cancers. 
Both of these risks contribute to a variable extent to lip 
and oral cavity, oesophageal, larynx, and liver cancers. 
The age-standardised incidence rate of the first three of 
these cancers decreased in India from 1990 to 2016, and 
that of liver increased. While tobacco use in India has 
decreased during this period, alcohol use has increased.32 
The drop in incidence rate of lip and oral cavity, 
oesophageal, and larynx cancers could be partly related to 
a larger influence of tobacco than alcohol on these 
cancers, and the increase in incidence rate of liver cancer 
could be partly related to a larger influence of alcohol 
than tobacco on this cancer, in addition to the trends of 
yet unknown other risk factors contributing to all of 
these cancers. Collaborative multi-institutional research 
efforts on cancer risk factors can help address such 
knowledge gaps, as well as lead to a better understanding 
of the reasons for the substantial decreases or increases 
in the incidence of different types of cancers in different 
parts of India. Detailed decomposition analyses are 
needed to tease apart the contribution of population 
structure changes, risk factors, interventions, and other 
determinants to the trends of leading cancers in India.
The heterogeneity of the incidence rate of different 
types of cancers across India is vast. Major variations 
exist even within the same geographical region, such as 
neighbouring states in the northeast—for example, a 
15 times difference in age-standardised incidence rates 
of naso 
pharynx cancer between the neighbouring 
north-eastern states of Nagaland and Tripura. Examples 
of the heterogeneous distribution of important risk 
factors and the corresponding distribution of associated 
cancers are also insightful. The states in the northeast of 
 Articles

India generally have high tobacco use as well as a high 
incidence of lung, oesophageal, nasopharynx and other 
pharynx cancers that are associated with tobacco use. 
There are also unique tobacco consumption patterns 
in these states, such as use of tobacco-infused water in 
Mizoram.39,40 HPV and cervical cancer are both high 
in Dindigul in Tamil Nadu,41 consumption of smoked or 
preserved meats and stomach cancer are high in 
Mizoram,42 and delayed childbearing and lower parity 
are high in Kerala as is breast cancer.43 The many variations 
between the states indicate the need for state-specific 
approaches for cancer control. If the reasons for the 
heterogeneous distribution of the major cancer types in 
different parts of India are understood better through 
large-scale collaborative research, this knowledge could 
help plan more specific efforts to reduce the cancer 
burden across the states of India.
The National Cancer Control Programme was initiated 
by the Government of India in 1975 to equip tertiary 
care cancer hospitals and institutions to implement 
systematic, equitable, and evidence-based strategies for 
prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and 
palliation, using available resources.44 State cancer 
institutes and tertiary care cancer centres have been 
established under this programme that are responsible for 
improved cancer awareness and management at the state 
level.45 Despite these attempts, access to critical cancer 
treatment is low in the country. For example, availability of 
radiotherapy machines is poor, there are delays in 
treatment, and there is geographic inequity in the 
distribution of such resources.10,11,46 With the launch of the 
National Programme for Control of Cancer, Diabetes, 
CVD and Stroke in 2010 in India, the cancer control efforts 
are now part of this umbrella programme for non-
communicable diseases.47 The national programme aims 
to tackle cancer by addressing preventable common risk 
factors through community-level, cost-effective screening 
for high-burden cancers, which include clinical breast 
examination for breast cancer, visual inspection with 
acetic acid for cervical cancer and visual examination for 
oral cancers.14 However, there are many challenges with 
these efforts, including difficulties with trained human 
resources, follow-up of positive tests, timely diagnosis, 
and well-tracked referral pathways.48 Additionally, there 
are limited population-level screening modalities available 
for some of the cancers responsible for the highest 
cancer burden in India, such as stomach and lung cancers. 
Primary prevention should therefore be promoted for 
these cancers, which can be guided by the heterogeneity 
between the states in this report. For secondary prevention, 
less invasive tests for H pylori may offer cost-effective 
first-line tests for referrals to more invasive endoscopic 
tests for early detection of stomach cancer.49 Faecal occult 
blood testing as a non-invasive, cost-effective approach to 
screen for colorectal cancer should also be considered.50
Ideally, national and state-level efforts should coordinate 
to facilitate the development of a prevention-to-palliation 
system of upward referral for early confirmatory diagnosis 
and prompt treatment of cancers, and downward referral 
for adequate follow-up, including palliative care and pain 
relief. The experience of some states can be useful to 
develop such strategies. For example, the Tamil Nadu 
Health Systems Project paved the way for lessons on 
breast and cervical cancer screening, from which the 
importance of community awareness, referral pathways, 
health management information systems, and trained 
human resources emerged as critical factors for a 
successful 
screening 
programme.48,51 
Shortage 
of 
appropriately educated and trained medical officers for 
treatment, management, and palliative care for cancer 
patients, particularly outside metropolitan cities, remains 
a challenge across the country.10 Recent attempts to 
address this gap include training through the Extension 
of Community Healthcare Outcomes tele-mentoring 
model for primary health-care providers and specialists 
on cancer screening and management by the National 
Institute of Cancer Prevention and Research.52 Attempts 
are also being made to strengthen tertiary cancer manage-
ment by developing evidence-based guidelines through 
the knowledge exchange platform of the National Cancer 
Grid of India.12 Placing the India cancer trends in the 
global context, the overall age-standardised incidence rate 
of cancers has been stable in India during the past quarter 
century, but it has increased in the other BRICS countries 
(Brazil, Russia, China and South Africa) where the rate is 
currently about double that in India.53 India should avoid 
the increasing trends observed in these countries by 
establishing adequate preventive measures that are 
consistent with the heterogeneity of cancer distribution 
in different parts of the country.
Cancer patients in India incur heavy out-of-pocket 
expenditures.11,54 The insurance programmes in some 
states and a previous national insurance scheme 
have attempted to minimise the impact of this on 
households.55–57 The recently announced National Health 
Protection Mission (Ayushman Bharat), which aims 
to provide substantial health insurance coverage for 
500 million people from low-income households, has the 
potential to reduce the economic burden of cancer and 
other non-communicable diseases at the population level 
across the country.58 It would be useful to ensure that all 
relevant aspects of cancer care are included in this health 
protection scheme.
This report provides a comprehensive descriptive 
epidemiology of cancer and its heterogeneity across all 
states of India from 1990 to 2016. India pioneered the 
establishment and expansion of the National Cancer 
Registry Programme (NCRP) under the Indian Council of 
Medical Research through a network of cancer registries 
during the past 30 years, which now covers 23 states and 
union territories.23 The GBD methods rely substantially 
on the NCRP data from India, but they also use data from 
all accessible data sources, including some registries that 
are not part of the NCRP, cause of death data from the 
 Articles

1303
SRS and other sources, and a variety of covariates to arrive 
at the best possible estimates for states where registries do 
not exist. Accordingly, differences are expected between 
the GBD estimates and the statistics reported by the 
NCRP, which are based entirely on population-based 
registries.23 The objectives and advantages of the GBD and 
NCRP approaches are complementary. While the NCRP 
adheres to a standardised methodology established by 
WHO’s International Agency for Research in Cancer, the 
GBD methodology provides a standardised approach that 
also incorporates other sources of data for estimations for 
all states of India, including those where registries do not 
exist such as the populous states of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, 
Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh. The GBD methodology is 
integrated into a larger total disease framework estimation 
process that allows comparison of the cancer burden to 
that of other diseases, which has helped to highlight the 
increasing contribution of cancers to the disease burden 
in India over the past quarter century. The close 
collaboration between the NCRP and GBD has made the 
findings in this report possible. It has also further 
highlighted the need to establish cancer registries in large 
states of north India where none exist, as well as adequate 
coverage of rural populations.
The limitations of the findings in this report include 
the general limitations of the GBD approach that are 
described elsewhere.1,25–28 Input data used to generate 
cancer mortality can be biased in multiple ways.1 A high 
proportion of ill-defined cancer cases in the registry data 
or ill-defined causes of death in mortality data sources 
require redistribution of these cases, which can 
introduce bias. Underreporting of cancers that require 
advanced diagnostic techniques (eg, leukaemia, brain, 
pancreatic, and liver cancer) can be an issue in data from 
areas where access to these technologies is scarce. 
Conversely, misclassification of metastatic sites as 
primary cancer can lead to overestimation of cancer sites 
that are common sites for metastases like the brain or 
liver. In addition, risk factors for breast and cervical 
cancer that are related to reproductive history in women, 
such as age at first birth and parity, are not yet included 
in the GBD risk factor assessment. A specific limitation 
for India is an inadequate cause of death reporting as 
part of the vital registration system, which reports 
medically certified cause of death only for a small 
proportion of deaths in India so far, with variable 
coverage across the states. The SRS provides cause of 
death data using verbal autopsy for all states in India, 
which is a reasonable alternative data source when the 
cause-specific data are not fully available from vital 
registration systems.4 However, this situation highlights 
the need to improve vital registration and improve 
training to code cause of death across India. The absence 
of population-based registries in major populous states 
of north India such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh leaves 
open questions about the magnitude of some cancers 
such as gallbladder cancer, which are expected by the 
India cancer community to be high there, but this 
cannot be substantiated yet because of the paucity of 
population-level evidence. Even in the existing registries, 
the mortality data are variable and need to be 
strengthened in order to arrive at more robust estimates 
of MI ratios. The very sparse presence of rural cancer 
registries in India is also a limitation. In cancer data-
scarce locations, the estimates for the types of cancer 
were calculated using covariates, which are explanatory 
variables with a causal relation to cancer incidence and 
mortality.1 The strengths of the findings presented in 
this report were the use of standardised GBD 
methodology and inclusion of all accessible data from 
multiple sources, and the substantial contribution of a 
large network of cancer experts from India in the 
analysis and inter 
pretation of the findings.
In conclusion, the detailed epidemiology of 28 types of 
cancer in every state of India over a quarter century 
described in this report highlights the substantial 
variations between the states for the different types of 
cancer, and can serve as a useful reference for more 
targeted planning of cancer control that is commensurate 
with the trends of different cancers in each state of India. 
The increasing overall contribution of cancer to disease 
burden in India should motivate more systematic and 
large-scale approaches to reduce this burden at the 
population level across the country. These efforts should 
include improved human resources and infrastructure for 
prevention, screening, treatment, and palliative care for 
cancers, as well as adequate financial protection for cancer 
care. These approaches should focus at least on the ten 
cancers that contribute the highest DALYs in India—ie, 
stomach, breast, lung, lip and oral cavity, pharynx other 
than nasopharynx, colon and rectum, leukaemia, cervical, 
oesophageal, and brain and nervous system cancers. Other 
types of cancer should also be addressed in India as 
circumstances and resources allow.
