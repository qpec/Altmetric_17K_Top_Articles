Alcohol Use Disorder and Mortality Across the Lifespan
A Longitudinal Cohort and Co-relative Analysis
Kenneth S. Kendler, MD; Henrik Ohlsson, PhD; Jan Sundquist, MD, PhD; Kristina Sundquist, MD, PhD
IMPORTANCE Excess alcohol consumption and alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are associated
with substantially increased mortality. Efforts to reduce this toll require an understanding of
their causes.
OBJECTIVE To clarify the degree to which the excess mortality associated with AUDs arises (1)
from the predispositions of the person who develops AUD (and which would likely be shared
by close relatives) and (2) as a direct result of AUD itself.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospective cohort and co-relative design study
involving all individuals born in Sweden from 1940 to 1965 who had neither died nor
migrated prior to 1973 or age 15 years (N = 2 821 036). They were followed up from January 1,
1973, until December 31, 2010. Alcohol use disorder was assessed from medical, criminal, and
pharmacy registries. Half-siblings, full-siblings, and monozygotic twin pairs discordant for
AUD were obtained from the Multi-Generation and Twin Register.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE Death obtained from the Swedish Death registry.
RESULTS Our cohort (1 447 887 males and 1 373 149 females) included 131 895 males and
42 163 females registered with AUD. The mean (SD) age at first AUD registration was 39 (13.4)
years. We ascertained 127 347 and 76 325 deaths in the male and female subsamples,
respectively. Controlling for sex, educational status, and year of birth, the mortality hazard
ratio associated with AUD was 5.83 (95% CI, 5.76-5.90) and varied—with an inverted
U-shaped function—by age. Examining the AUD-mortality association in the general
population and in relative pairs discordant for AUD exposure demonstrated substantial
familial confounding in early to mid-adulthood: the AUD-associated mortality hazard ratio
was much lower in discordant close relatives than in the general population. In middle to late
adulthood, evidence for familial confounding decreased with increasing evidence for a direct
effect of AUD on elevated mortality. In the oldest age group (65-70 years), the mortality
hazard ratios were similar across the population and all relative pairs, suggesting that the
excess mortality was largely a result of having AUD. Adding years since onset of AUD to the
model showed that both increasing age and increasing years of duration of AUD contributed
to the reduction of familial confounding in the association between AUD and elevated
mortality.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Excess mortality associated with AUD arises both from the
predispositions of the person who develops AUD and the direct result of having AUD. The
effect of predisposition is more prominent early in the life course and in the early years of
AUD. The direct effect of AUD becomes progressively more important later in life and with
longer duration of AUD. These results have implications for interventions seeking to reduce
the elevated AUD-associated mortality.

Our intemperance it is, that pulls so many several incurable dis-
eases upon our heads, that hastens old age, perverts our tempera-
ture [read as temperament], and brings upon us sudden death.
Robert Burton, The Anatomy of Melancholia (1660), 19261(p156)
Excess alcohol consumption and alcohol use disorders (AUDs)
are associated with substantially increased mortality.2-7 In
2000,excessivealcoholuseaccountedfor85 000deathsayear
in the United States, representing the third leading modifi-
able cause of death.8 Alcohol-related deaths contributed to the
marked increase in all-cause mortality in US white non-
Hispanic men from 1999 to 2013.9 Efforts to reduce this toll
require an understanding of its causes.
We sought to discriminate 2 mechanisms for this associa-
tion. The increased mortality could arise from the habits and
predispositions of the person who develops AUD or it could be
adirecteffectofAUDitself(eg,highalcoholconsumption,with-
drawal symptoms, frequent drunkenness, dietary deficien-
cies, and social isolation). While prevention methods fo-
cused on reducing alcohol consumption should affect excess
mortality arising from the second mechanism, such ap-
proaches should not alter excess mortality resulting from the
first mechanism.
Because human longevity is substantially heritable,10-12 a
co-relative design should help distinguish these 2 mecha-
nisms.ExcessAUDmortalityduetothisfirstmechanismshould
result in substantial familial confounding because unaf-
fected close relatives of individuals with AUD, given the strong
evidence of familial/genetic influences on most aspects of hu-
man behavior,13 would often share their habits and predispo-
sitions. Under this scenario, the association between AUD and
mortality should be much stronger in the general population
than in close relatives discordant for AUD. By contrast, the sec-
ond mechanism would predict little familial confounding of
the AUD-associated excess mortality as unaffected relatives
would not be exposed to the direct effects of having AUD.
Therefore, the increased mortality rate associated with AUD
would be similar in the general population and in close rela-
tives discordant for AUD.
However, clarifying the sources of the elevated mortality
in AUD must also take into account changes in the magnitude
of this excess by age and years of AUD.2,3,14-16 Because we can-
not assume that the underlying mechanism will be constant
across the lifespan, the ideal study would have sufficient
sample size to clarify patterns of familial confounding across
the lifespan. We describe such a study based on a Swedish na-
tional sample with AUD ascertained from medical, criminal,
and pharmacy registries.
Methods
We collected information on individuals from Swedish popu-
lation-based registers with national coverage. Registers were
linked using each person’
s unique identification number. To
preserve confidentiality, this number was replaced by a serial
number. The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Re-
view Board of Lund University; consent was not obtained as
the study was based on registry information. For our defini-
tion of AUD, see the eAppendix in the Supplement. Year of
death was assessed from the Swedish Mortality Register, con-
taining causes of death from 1961 to 2010.
Sample
The database began with all individuals born in Sweden from
1940 to 1965 who had neither died nor migrated prior to 1973
or age 15 years (N = 2 821 036). For this population, we in-
cluded year of their first AUD registration, year of death, and
year of emigration. We also included highest level (lifetime)
of educational status (≤9 years, 10-11 years, and ≥12 years), sex,
and year of birth.
Statistical Analysis
In the first analysis, we used Cox proportional hazards mod-
elstoinvestigatetheriskfordeathfromage15yearsuntildeath
(7.2%), emigration (4.6%), or follow-up until 2010 (88.2%) in
individuals as a function of their first AUD registration. As the
firstregistrationforAUDcouldoccuratvaryingages,wetreated
AUD as a time-dependent covariate17: ie, from age 15 years un-
til year of the first AUD registration, individuals were treated
as AUD free, while from that AUD registration, they were con-
sidered registered for AUD. In the model, the proportionality
assumption—that the hazard ratios (HRs) were constant over
time—was not fulfilled because the AUD-mortality associa-
tionvariedacrossages.Therefore,weallowedtheeffectofAUD
to differ based on age intervals. We tested several different
models and selected our model based on fit values (lowest
Akaike Information Criterion [AIC]18) and nonoverlapping 95%
CIs for the effect of AUD. In the final model, we included the
following age intervals: 15 to 24, 25 to 29, 30 to 39, 40 to 44,
45 to 49, 50 to 54, 55 to 59, 60 to 64, and 65 to 70 years. Ro-
bust SEs were used to adjust confidence intervals to reflect in-
dividuals coming from the same family. We also included year
of birth, education, and sex in the model.
We assessed the degree to which the results from the re-
gression model reflected familial confounding using a co-
relative design. With the Swedish Multi-Generation Register
and the Swedish Twin Register, we identified all monozy-
gotic (MZ) twin pairs and full- and half-sibling pairs. Using
Key Points
Question What causes the substantial excess mortality associated
with alcohol use disorders (AUDs)?
Findings In this cohort and co-relative study in Sweden, AUD was
associated with excess mortality. In pairs of relatives discordant for
AUD, substantial familial confounding was seen for the
AUD-mortality association in early to mid-adulthood, with the
degree of confounding decreasing strongly with age.
Meaning Excess mortality associated with AUD arises both from
the predispositions of the person who develops AUD and the
direct result of having AUDs and the effect of predisposition is
more prominent early in the life course and in the early years of
AUD.

stratified Cox proportional hazards models, we refit all analy-
ses within strata of specific relative set (MZ twins: 5507 total
pairs, with 532 AUD discordant; full-siblings: 781 608 sib-
ships, with 100 128 containing members discordant for AUD;
and half-siblings: 291 520 total pairs, with 54 416 AUD discor-
dant). Only sets where members differed in exposure to AUD
at some age contributed to regression results. Within each
strata, the HR was then adjusted for the familial cluster, and,
therefore, accounts for an array of unmeasured genetic and en-
vironmental factors shared by relatives.
In the next step, we combined all 4 samples (ie, popula-
tion, twin, full-siblings, and half-siblings) into 1 data set. From
the population sample, we randomly selected the same num-
ber of individuals contained in the full-sibling analysis
(n = 2 001 950). We performed 2 analyses. The first allowed all
parameters for each sample to be independent within the
samples and age intervals. The second modeled only the ge-
netic resemblance, given evidence that resemblance for lon-
gevityinSwedenresultsonlyfromgeneticfactors.19Withineach
age interval, we assumed that this parameter reflected genetic
resemblance for each sample: ie, 0 for the population, 0.25 for
the half-sibling, 0.5 for the full-sibling, and 1.0 for the twin
sample.WecomparedthesemodelsbyAIC.Ifthesecondmodel
fit better, we obtained an HR for the slope of the familial con-
founding within each age interval and an improved estimation
of the association among all relatives, but especially MZ twins,
where the data were sparsest. While this genetic slope (GS) is
estimated using information from the general population and
all the relative pairs, it can most easily be understood from the
following formula: HR_MZd = HR_GP × GS. That is, the esti-
mated HR from discordant MZ twins (MZd) is obtained by mul-
tiplying the HR estimated from the general population (GP) by
GS. Thus, a GS near unity means that the HRs are similar in the
population and discordant MZ twin pairs, suggesting little fa-
milial confounding and a potential causal association between
AUD and mortality. A GS value approaching zero means a sharp
declineintheHRsacrossrelativepairsofincreasingaffinityand,
therefore, reflects a high degree of familial confounding.
In a final step, we investigated whether the familial con-
founding was mainly a result of age vs time since first AUD reg-
istration. Using the combined data set, we constructed 4 new
parameters for years since first AUD registration: 1 to 5, 6 to
10, 11 to 20, and 21 or more years. Using the same modeling
framework, we first fitted a stratified Cox regression model al-
lowing these 4 parameters to be independent within each
sample and age interval. We then obtained a slope for the fa-
milial confounding for each of the 4 parameters, which de-
scribe years since registration and within each age interval. All
statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS
Institute Inc).20

Alcohol use disorder registration was associated with a sub-
stantially elevated mortality rate, with the mortality HR (mHR)
controlling for sex, educational status, and year of birth esti-
mated at 5.83 (95% CI, 5.76-5.90). However, the mHR was not
constant over time, with a linear model suggesting a rapid de-
cline with increasing age (age by AUD HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.64-
0.65). Therefore, we examined the effect of AUD on mortality

ity by age group in the general population and in half-

Our model, which predicted the mHR as a function of degree
of genetic association among the relative pairs, fit the data well
(AIC of model vs raw data: 4 090 815.9 vs 4 090 817.2). Param-
eterestimatesareseeninFigure2.Inearlyadulthood,themHR
in close relatives discordant for AUD exposure was much lower
than that seen in the general population. In particular, the es-
timated mHR conditional on AUD in discordant MZ twins did
not differ significantly from 1 for ages 15 to 24 years and 25 to
29 years. By age 40 years, the estimated mHRs for the general
population and for discordant close relative pairs were less dis-
crepant. In MZ pairs, the mHR in the twin with AUD was more
than 4 times greater than the unaffected twin. However, the
mHR in discordant MZ twins was still much less than the mHR
of nearly 8 seen in the general population. Finally, above the
age of 55 years, the differences in mHR between the popula-
tion and relatives declined further so that by our last age pe-
riod (65-70 years), no appreciable differences were seen in the
mHR across all our groups with all values around 4.
These analyses did not control for years of AUD expo-
sure. To investigate this question, our next model examined
both age and years since first AUD registration divided into 4
periods. Our model again fit the data well (AIC of model vs raw
data: 4 002 503.9 vs 4 002 519.9). The estimated parameters
fromthismodelillustrated2majortrends(Figure3).First,aside
from the anomalous results (likely due to small sample sizes)
for ages 65 to 70 years within 1 to 5 years of first registration,
we saw the general trend observed in Figure 2: the slopes of
themHRsinthegeneralpopulationandincreasinglycloserela-
tives were steeper at younger ages and gradually approached
horizontal at older ages. Second, from age 40 years onward,
within age periods, the differences in mHR across groups
tended to decline with increasing years from first registra-
tion. However, this trend was less consistent in the oldest
groups. We illustrate these trends in Figure 4, which depicts
the GS of the mHRs across the 4 groups (general population
and discordant half-siblings, full-siblings, and MZ twins) as a
function of years since first AUD registration and age.
Althoughmanyoftheseestimatesarenotknownwithhigh
precision, the general trends are clear. For individuals within
1 to 5 or 6 to 10 years of their first AUD registration, a strong
monotonic trend was seen for slopes to increase (that is, dem-
onstrate less confounding) with increasing age. For those 11 or
more years past first registration, this trend was largely re-
stricted to the youngest available age group (those 25-29 years
for 11-20 years after onset and 30-39 years for those ≥21 years
pastonset).Finally,withinagegroups,ageneraltrendwasseen
for the values of the slopes to increase with increasing years
since first AUD registration.
Discussion
From ages 15 to 70 years, AUD was associated with a nearly
6-fold increase in all-cause mortality. This association is con-
sistent with prior studies,4,15,16,21 although considerably stron-
gerthanthatestimatedfrom2recentmeta-analyses:3.38(95%
CI, 2.98-3.84) in men, 4.57 (95% CI, 3.86-5.42) in women,3 and
3.45 (95% CI, 2.96-4.02) in both sexes.2 Congruent with prior
findings,3,14 the magnitude of this association varied substan-
tially by age, being weakest in late adulthood.
Our major goal was to elucidate the mechanisms of the
AUD-mortalityassociation.Towhatdegreedoestheexcessrate
of death in individuals with AUD arise because of predisposi-
tions in the person who develops AUD vs results from the di-
rect effect of the AUD itself?
We first addressed this question by examining the pattern
of mHRs in 9 age groups in unrelated members of the general
population and in half-siblings, full-siblings, and MZ twins dis-
cordantforAUD.Intheyoungeragegroups(ie,those<40years),
mHRs (1) were much greater in the general population than in
the discordant relative pairs, (2) became progressively smaller
in more closely related individuals, and (3) did not differ from
unity in discordant MZ twins. This is the pattern expected for
strong familial confounding. That is, the association between
AUD and excess mortality in these age groups would appear to
result largely from shared familial factors rather than the direct
effects of AUD itself. These factors might include personality
traits, such as impulsivity or novelty seeking, or a proclivity to-
ward other substance use or misuse, which are both associated
with AUD22,23 and under genetic influence.24,25
By middle adulthood (ages 40-59 years), the picture shifts.
The mHRs in close relatives were much lower than in the

unity. This is the picture that would be expected if the AUD-
mortality association arose from a mixture of familial con-
founding and direct causal relationships. Direct causal ef-
fects of AUD are likely to be complex and include exposure to
high levels of alcohol intake often over long periods, frequent
intoxication, and the associated poor judgment in dangerous
situations (eg, driving and physical aggression), poor nutri-
tion,increasedtobaccoandotherdruguse,socialisolation,and
poorer health care. Of course, for some of these associations
(eg, AUD and social isolation or drug use), causal effects are
likely to be bidirectional. Finally, by late adulthood, little
difference was seen in the mHRs across the general pop-
ulation and all our samples of discordant relatives including

discordant MZ twin pairs. This is the picture expected if the
preponderance of the AUD-mortality association arose as a di-
rect result of the AUD itself.
The findings from our co-relative design suggesting a di-
rect causal effect of AUD on mortality is consistent with sev-
eral prior lines of evidence. First, naturalistic studies show
declines in mortality with reduced alcohol consumption at a
population level (eg, Prohibition in the United States26 and the
Gorbachev reforms in the Soviet Union27). Second, a previ-
ous meta-analysis showed that alcohol-dependent individu-
als who continued to drink heavily had significantly greater
mortality than alcohol-dependent individuals who reduced
their alcohol intake.2 Third, 6 randomized clinical trials have
shown that interventions leading to reduced drinking also re-
duced mortality rates.28
Our final analyses added to our initial model years since
first AUD registration, with the goal of clarifying the degree to
which chronological age or years of AUD were most predic-
tive of the level of familial confounding in the AUD-mortality
association. The results suggested that both contributed. That
is, the older the individual and the longer they had AUD, the
larger the proportion of the AUD-mortality association that ap-
peared to be causal.
These results should be interpreted in the context of 6 po-
tentialmethodologicallimitations.First,wedetectedindividu-
als with AUD from official registry records obviating the need
for cooperation or accurate recall. The validity of our method
is supported by high concordance for registration across our
modes of ascertainment.29 However, prevalence of AUD in this
sample was substantially lower than estimated from interview
surveysintheUnitedStates30,31andNorway.30,32Therefore,our
AUD cases are likely to be more severely affected than those as-
certained from population-based interview studies. The stron-
ger association with mortality for AUD observed in this vs prior
samples2,3 might result from the high average severity of our
ascertained cases and, in particular, our use of medical regis-
try, as among individuals with AUD in the general population,
treatment is associated with increased mortality.2
Second, our sample likely contained heavy-drinking indi-
viduals never registered for AUD. To explore how much this
might bias our results, we examined alcohol consumption at
ages 18 to 20 years available from 2 years of military conscrip-
tion records (1969-1970) in male-male sibling pairs discor-
dant for lifetime AUD registration.33 Standardized alcohol con-
sumption scores for those who did and did not have a
subsequent AUD registration were +0.40 and −0.04, respec-
tively. The unaffected sibling from discordant pairs had a mean
consumption score of +0.01, suggesting only modestly in-
creaseddrinkingatleastinlateadolescence.Nonetheless,some
of the familial confounding observed in our study could arise
because nonregistered close relatives of AUD probands drink
at higher rates than the general population.
Third, our models included both men and women with sex
as a covariate, thereby controlling for the stronger AUD-
mortality association in females observed in both our and prior
samples.15,21 The substantially lower prevalence of AUD in
women in our sample made it impossible to informatively fit
more complex models to the sexes separately.
Fourth, our integrative model assumed that familial con-
founding of the AUD-mortality association was mediated ge-
netically. The validity of this assumption was supported by the
good fit of these models. We directly evaluated this assump-
tion by comparing the AUD-mortality association in half-
siblings reared together or apart. Consistent with our assump-
tion, we found no evidence for differences in the degree of
confounding, despite differences in shared environmental
exposures in the half-sibling groups.
Fifth, results from our younger age groups, in which indi-
viduals could be included only if they were born in the earlier
years of our cohort and had an early age at first registration,
could be biased. We repeated analyses for a cohort born from
1966 to 1990 for which we could define 4 age groups: 15 to 24,
25 to 29, 30 to 39, and 40 to 44 years. Although estimates for
the oldest group were very imprecise, we replicated our key
finding of decreasing level of confounding of the AUD-
mortality association with increasing age (eFigure in the
Supplement).
Finally, the Swedish mortality registry contains Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases codes for cause of death. An im-
portant future research question would be the degree to which
an examination of these codes can shed further light on the
causal association between AUD and premature mortality.34
Conclusions
Using a large-scale population-based prospective cohort de-
sign, we found a substantial increase in mortality in both men
and women registered with AUD. Using a co-relative design,
weshowedthatthisexcessmortalityappearstoarisebothfrom
the predispositions of the person who develops AUD and from
the direct result of the AUD itself. The effects of the predispo-
sitions were more prominent early in the life course and in the
earlier years of AUD. The direct effect of AUD on mortality be-
came progressively more important later in life and later in the
course of AUD. These results have clear implications for inter-
ventions that seek to reduce the substantially elevated rates
of mortality in those with AUD.
