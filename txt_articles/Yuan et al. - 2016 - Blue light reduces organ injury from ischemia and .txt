Evidence suggests that light and circadian rhythms profoundly
influence the physiologic capacity with which an organism responds
to stress. However, the ramifications of light spectrum on the course
of critical illness remain to be determined. Here, we show that acute
exposure to bright blue spectrum light reduces organ injury by
comparison with bright red spectrum or ambient white fluorescent
light in two murine models of sterile insult: warm liver ischemia/
reperfusion (I/R) and unilateral renal I/R. Exposure to bright blue
light before I/R reduced hepatocellular injury and necrosis and
reduced acute kidney injury and necrosis. In both models, blue light
reduced neutrophil influx, as evidenced by reduced myeloperox-
idase (MPO) within each organ, and reduced the release of high-
mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a neutrophil chemotactant and key
mediator in the pathogenesis of I/R injury. The protective mecha-
nism appeared to involve an optic pathway and was mediated, in
part, by a sympathetic (β3 adrenergic) pathway that functioned in-
dependent of significant alterations in melatonin or corticoste-
rone concentrations to regulate neutrophil recruitment. These
data suggest that modifying the spectrum of light may offer ther-
apeutic utility in sterile forms of cellular injury.

unlight, the sole source of energy for all living organisms, has
profound effects on life. Prior studies precipitated excitement
regarding the therapeutic value of bright light, noting that more
light could benefit certain diseases (1–3). But this initial enthusi-
asm has been dampened by later studies that failed to replicate
these findings (4–8). However, light is complex, defined by illu-
minance (intensity), photoperiod (duration), and wavelength; and
yet, few clinical studies have incorporated this complexity into
their design. For example, hospitalized patients suffer simulta-
neously from considerably decreased intensity of daylight, an ex-
panded photoperiod due to continuous or misdirected and thus
excessive and obtrusive artificial light called “light pollution,” and
a change in spectrum between sunlight and artificial light (4, 5, 9).
Each of these factors could influence the biology and outcome of
disease, and yet have not been rigorously controlled in prior
studies. This complexity of light may contribute, in part, to the in-
ability of prior observational trials to identify an association between
light exposure and the outcomes studied.
Mammals perceive visible light (400–700 nm), and experimental
animal evidence suggests that each dimension of light can modify
animal biology (10–14). In rodents, acute bright light exposure
induced the release of corticosterone (15, 16). Fish raised under
light of blue/green spectrum exhibited reduced oxidative stress by
comparison with environmental red light (13, 14). And a novel
paradigm posits that seasonal variation in environmental stress (e.g.,
thermal, starvation) evolutionarily selected animals expressing
photoperiodism: the ability to interpret environmental day length
(17, 18). Responding to a progressively shorter photoperiod, en-
ergetic resources are concentrated in endogenous mechanisms (i.e.,
immune function) necessary for seasonally appropriate survival
strategies. Although these collective data suggest that light may
influence adaptive responses to and during illness, the ramifications
of acute alterations in light exposure on health and disease remain
to be defined (1–4, 7).
In this study we focus on whether the spectrum of light, holding
illuminance and photoperiod constant, can favorably modify the
biology of critical illness. Using two independent, murine models
of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), we determine that high- illuminance
blue spectrum light functioning through an optic pathway medi-
ates adaptive changes in the response to the critical stress of I/R
that protects against organ injury.
Results
Blue Light Before Liver I/R Attenuates Liver Injury and Cellular
Necrosis. Certain clinical circumstances (e.g., hepatic resection,
transplantation) are amenable to pretreatment and characterized
by a period of I/R that induces sterile (i.e., absence of infectious
etiology) cellular injury. We initially explored whether blue, red, or
ambient white fluorescent light altered organ injury when applied
before I/R. Pretreatment with blue light protected against liver
injury during I/R, as evidenced by reduced serum alanine amino-
transferase (ALT) concentration: blue 1,300 IU/L vs. red 2,038 IU/L
(P = 0.01) and vs. ambient 2,860 IU/L (P = 0.008; Fig. 1A). Blue
light also significantly reduced hepatocellular necrosis (Fig. 1B).
Blue Light Before Kidney I/R Attenuates Acute Kidney Injury and
Cellular Necrosis. We next explored whether blue light protected
against organ injury in an independent model of unilateral renal
I/R. Pretreatment with blue light protected against acute kidney in-
jury (AKI), as evidenced by reduced serum cystatin C concentration:
Significance
It is well established that light regulates mammalian biology.
And yet, we have been unable to define and thus harness the
underlying mechanisms so as to apply them to alter the course
of human disease. In this study we determine that the spectrum
of light is a critical determinant of its effect on critical illness. We
show that an acute and short (24 h) exposure to high-illumi-
nance (1,400 lx) blue spectrum (peak 442 nm) light prior to is-
chemia/reperfusion (I/R) significantly attenuates the degree of
organ injury. Our characterization of the biological mechanisms
through which blue light beneficially alters the cellular response
to I/R provides an opportunity to develop novel therapeutics for
the prevention and treatment of many diseases.

 blue 1,069 ng/mL vs. red 1,409 ng/mL (P = 0.008) and vs. ambient
1,500 ng/mL (P = 0.001; Fig. 2A). Blue light also reduced renal tu-
bular cellular necrosis (Fig. 2B).
The Effects of Blue Light Are Mediated Through an Optic Pathway.
Known pathways through which light may mediate its biologi-
cal effects are the eyes and skin. We initially interrogated for an
optic pathway using Vsx2 KO mice, which undergo optic nerve
degeneration (19). Wild-type mice exposed to blue light again
exhibited reduced hepatic injury by comparison with red light: ALT
698 IU/L vs. 938 IU/L, P = 0.03 (Fig. 3A). However, this difference
was lost in Vsx2 KO mice: 650 IU/L vs. 645 IU/L, P = 0.94.
Blue Light Reduces Liver and Kidney Myeloperoxidase Activity During
I/R. The neutrophil is regarded as the ultimate effector of the
cellular injury of I/R (20–22). We observed in both models that
blue light reduced neutrophil influx into the ischemic organ, as
evidenced by reduced liver and kidney myeloperoxidase (MPO)
(Fig. 3 B and C). In addition, the effects of blue light on neu-
trophil recruitment during liver I/R required an optic pathway
(Fig. 3B).
Blue Light Attenuates High-Mobility Group Box 1 Release During I/R.
Danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules are
nuclear or cytosolic proteins that are released outside the cell
following tissue injury, such as I/R, and can initiate and per-
petuate a noninfectious inflammatory/immune response. High-
mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a nuclear DAMP, is a key
mediator in the causal pathway of I/R-mediated neutrophil
damage (23, 24). We observed that during I/R, mice exposed to
blue light exhibited reduced concentrations of serum HMGB1
(Fig. 4). Two bands migrated to the appropriate molecular
weight, which has been observed by us and others, and may be
due to posttranslational modification, including phosphorylation
and acetylation (23, 25, 26).
Blue Light Does Not Alter Serum Melatonin and Corticosterone
Concentrations. Many facets of immunity exhibit a circadian
pattern and appear under the regulatory influence of melatonin
and light (27–29). However, the serum of mice exposed to blue,
red, and ambient light demonstrated similar circadian concen-
trations of melatonin (Fig. 5A). Corticosteroid (i.e., cortisol,
corticosterone) hormones also exhibit circadian rhythm and may
influence immunity (30). However, we observed little difference
in systemic corticosterone concentrations in blue-, red-, and
ambient-exposed mice (Fig. 5B). Finally, acute sleep deprivation
has been shown to attenuate neuroinflammation and cell death
after ischemia and to attenuate systemic inflammation in murine
models of endotoxemia (31, 32). However, we observed similar
activities of mice exposed to a 24-h photoperiod of blue and red
light (Fig. S1A).
Blue Light Functions Through an Adrenergic Pathway. Recently it has
been shown that sympathetic signals govern a circadian oscillation

 in leukocyte emigration into tissues that alters the susceptibility to
and outcome from inflammatory diseases (27, 33). Thus, we ex-
plored whether blue light regulates sympathetic tone and thereby
reduces neutrophil influx and organ injury during I/R. We initially
quantified the heart rate variability of mice exposed to blue and
red light, focusing on the low frequency/high frequency (LF/HF)
ratio as a physiologic parameter of sympathetic activity (34–38).
We observed that mice exposed to blue light exhibited lower
sympathetic tone, as evidenced by reduced heart rates and LF/HF,
in contrast to mice exposed to red light (Fig. S1 B and C). We next
explored whether augmenting adrenergic tone reversed the pro-
tective effects of blue light. As shown in Fig. 6A, control (saline)
mice exposed to blue light exhibited reduced AKI by comparison
with control mice exposed to red light: cystatin C concentration:
blue + normal saline (NS) 1,068 ng/mL vs. red + NS 1,307 ng/mL
(P = 0.04). However, when mice were administered the β3 agonist
CL-316,243, blue light no longer was protective: cystatin C con-
centration, blue + CL 1,215 ng/mL vs. red + NS 1,307 ng/mL (P =
0.25). Similarly, β3 agonism partly reversed the reduction in MPO
in mice exposed to blue light (Fig. 6B). Alternatively, administering
the β3 antagonist SR 59230A (39) to mice before I/R did not reduce
AKI: SR 1,154 ng/mL vs. NS 1,019 ng/mL (P = 0.20) (Fig. 6C).
Discussion
Prior studies precipitated excitement regarding the therapeutic
value of bright light or windows in beneficially altering human
disease, yet more contemporary studies have failed to replicate
these observations (1, 3–8). Thus, whether light can acutely
modify the biology of critical illness has never been described.
Here we report that a 24-h photoperiod of high-intensity blue
spectrum light attenuates organ injury in two clinically relevant,
animal models of hepatic and renal I/R. Importantly, the benefits
of blue light are translationally relevant to circumstances per-
mitting pretreatment (e.g., transplantation). The mechanism in-
volves an optic pathway that functions, in part, by a permissive
withdrawal of β3 adrenergic tone to reduce neutrophil recruitment.
Additionally, blue light inhibits the release of HMGB1, a key
mediator of I/R-induced organ injury. Collectively, our data sup-
port the potential of blue light as a therapy.
Little data are published on the effects of light spectra on
mammalian biology. Fish exposed to green or blue LEDs during
starvation exhibited less oxidative stress by comparison with red
LED exposure (13, 14). Whether blue and green light were
protective or red light was injurious could not be definitively
determined. We observed that during I/R, blue light reduced
organ injury and cellular necrosis. Our experimental conditions
included an ambient fluorescent light exposure to replicate the
typical artificial indoor lighting environment (i.e., the hospital).
For nearly every outcome parameter assessed, mice exposed to
this ambient light exhibited organ injury similar to mice exposed
to red light. Thus, our data strongly support that it is blue light that
is protective.
One mechanism by which light may alter the response to stress
is through changes in immunity: photoimmunomodulation (4, 5,
10, 11, 17, 18, 40). The neutrophil is a fundamental effector of
organ injury during I/R, and inhibiting neutrophil influx or func-
tion during I/R markedly reduces organ injury (20–22). We ob-
served that the kidneys and livers of mice exposed to blue light had
reduced infiltration of active neutrophils (i.e., MPO). Damage-
associated molecular patterns (DAMP), such as HMGB1, are
released during I/R, and others and we have shown that HMGB1
is a key mediator of inflammation and cellular damage during liver
I/R and ischemic AKI (23, 41). Recently it has been shown that
HMGB1 is released by necrotic cells and leads to neutrophil re-
cruitment and injury amplification (24). We observed that blue
light also reduced the systemic release of HMGB1. Thus, a re-
duction in the release of HMGB1 and an inhibition of neutrophil

 recruitment are two biological mechanisms by which blue light
may protect against ischemia.
The physiologic mechanism through which blue light regulated
these biological changes required an intact optic pathway. The
prototypical mediator of central circadian rhythms and photo-
immunomodulation is melatonin (29). Nearly every facet of
immunity exhibits a circadian pattern and appears under the
regulatory influence of melatonin and light (27, 28, 42, 43).
Similarly, corticosteroid stress hormones also exhibit circadian
rhythm, are modulated by acute light exposure and may influ-
ence immunity (15, 16). However, the effects of blue light oc-
curred without notable differences in systemic melatonin or
corticosterone concentrations in comparison with red light.
Furthermore, the experimental conditions of blue and red light
were characterized by identical photoperiods, illuminances, and
temperatures. These observations highlight the importance of
the spectrum of light in modifying the biological response to I/R,
and that mechanisms distinct from central circadian and adre-
nocortical axes are operant. Notably, degeneration of the optic
nerve as occurs in VsX2 KO mice correlated with reduced AKI
during I/R and a phenotype more closely approximating that of
mice exposed to blue light. These data may provide sufficient
impetus for a clinical investigation of the ramifications of optical
blindness on ischemic diseases.
Our analyses of melatonin and corticosteroids were attempts
to study the central circadian clock (i.e., SCN, melatonin) and
determine whether blue light altered these rhythms relative to
red light; our data suggest that it does not. These results do not
address whether circadian rhythms were altered, in general, by
any or all of the lighting conditions. Although corticosterone
concentrations exhibited a circadian pattern of release, melato-
nin was suppressed by each lighting condition. And, although the
capacity for light to suppress melatonin is dependent upon the
spectrum, contemporary studies demonstrate that red light (600,
630, 700 nm) of sufficient intensity can also suppress melatonin
(44, 45). We speculate that the high illuminance of our in-
tervention (Fig. S2) rendered similar suppression of melatonin
for both the red and blue light groups.
Nearly all visceral organs receive direct innervation from the
autonomic nervous system (ANS). The two branches of the ANS
are key regulators of immune responses (33, 46–48). Acute ex-
posure to bright light has been shown to rapidly induce sym-
pathoexcitation of adrenal, renal, and hepatic tissue (49–51).
These data may appear at odds with our overarching paradigm:
blue light leads to a withdrawal of sympathetic tone in reducing
immune-mediated injury. However, the exposure used in these
earlier studies was typically to white fluorescent (49) or in-
candescent (16, 50, 51) light of brief (10–30 min) duration, the

Blue light does not alter serum melatonin or corticosterone concentration. Mice (C57BL/6) were exposed to red, blue, or ambient light for 24 h (six
total mice per group for two experiments combined). Serum was isolated at CT5, CT13, CT20, and CT3 and analyzed for (A) melatonin (pg/mL) and (B)
corticosterone (ng/mL) concentrations. Corresponding box plots provide summary estimates (bar, median; box, IQR 25–75% range; whiskers, 1.5× IQR) of

 subsequent assessment of sympathetic activity was performed
within minutes, and the duration of sympathoexcitation transient
(20–180 min). In contrast, our intervention of a prolonged 24-h
photoperiod of rich, blue spectrum that is instituted in mice al-
ready exposed to ambient “day” illumination is distinct. In the
study of Ishida et al. (16), light exposure did not significantly
heighten adrenal sympathetic nerve activity when instituted at
daytime. And although Mutoh et al. (49) did observe increased
renal sympathetic nerve activity when mice were exposed to light
during the day, this sympathoexcitation was minimal and transient
(∼10 min) with an illuminance less than 2,000 lx; our red and blue
lights were 1,400 lx. When we exposed mice to a 24-h photoperiod
of blue spectrum light, they exhibited reduced sympathetic tone (i.e.,
heart rate, LF/HF). Thus, we perceive that our experimental
conditions are distinct from the prior literature, our data unique
and complementary to those previously published, and that a uni-
fying theme can explain these seemingly disparate results. Although
acutely white or fluorescent light may heighten sympathetic activity,
during more prolonged exposure, particularly to blue spectrum
light, a transition to a withdrawal of adrenergic tone may occur.
Chronic exposure to dim light at night (dLAN) has been
shown in rodents to suppress both humoral and cellular immu-
nity (9). Thus, the absence of a true night (<5 lx) could also
account for our observations. However, in these prior reports,
mice were chronically exposed (3–4 wk) to dLAN before immune
challenge. Furthermore, if dLAN were operant in our experi-
ments, its effects would have to have been spectrum specific,
because red and ambient light possessed a similar exposure to
light at night (LAN) as blue light, yet afforded no protection.
Alternatively, a continuous photoperiod may also disrupt sleep,
which too has been shown to be immunosuppressive (31, 32).
However, mice exhibited similar activity levels with each light
condition, and yet blue light was distinctly protective. Thus, we
perceive that mechanisms distinct from light pollution or sleep
disturbances are at play.
Recently, it has been described that long-range sympathetic
signals, modulated by light, govern a circadian oscillation in
leukocyte emigration into certain tissues (27, 33). In rodents,
sympathetic tone and leukocyte recruitment peak at night, a time
of maximal animal activity (27, 33). These circadian rhythms in
leukocyte migration alter the outcome from inflammatory dis-
eases; injury is maximal at night when adrenergic tone and
neutrophil emigration are highest. Our data suggest that blue
light reduces adrenergic tone and thereby, attenuates neutrophil
influx. We observed that the administration of a β3 agonist
inhibited the protective effects of blue light and rendered the
outcomes with blue light similar to those of red light. By contrast,
β3 antagonism did not afford protection. However, SR 59230A
also possesses α1 antagonism, which potentiates arterial vasodi-
latation, and thus may induce systemic hypotension and worsen
organ ischemia (52). Thus, the lack of protection with SR
59230A may be the consequence of the offsetting effects of β3
and α1 antagonism. Alternatively, these results may be inter-
preted to indicate that a withdrawal of β3 adrenergic tone is
permissive, although not sufficient for attenuating organ injury.
This interpretation would also be in agreement with our data
demonstrating that β3 agonism reverses the protection of blue
light. Thus, we propose that blue light, functioning through an
optic pathway, leads to a withdrawal in β3 sympathetic tone that
permissively reduces neutrophil influx and organ injury. The
reduction in cellular necrosis may further lead to a reduction in
the release of HMGB1, and thereby “break” an injury amplifi-
cation loop, characterized by additional neutrophil recruitment
and cellular injury.
In conclusion, our data support that light can be harnessed to
acutely modify the biology, physiology and outcome of critical
illness. Pretreatment with blue light is protective during I/R, and
thus represents a possible therapeutic to target and control
systemic inflammation and mitigate organ injury in clinical cir-
cumstances permitting pretreatment. However, there are distinct
differences between the visual, circadian, and immune biology of
nocturnal mammals, as studied herein, and that of diurnal Homo
sapiens. Thus, if light does impart therapeutic value, further in-
vestigation to determine the precise characteristics (illuminance,
photoperiod, and wavelength) will be critically important to
optimize its potential clinical translation.
Materials and Methods
Study Design. Our study was a randomized, controlled laboratory experiment
to study the biologic effects of three light spectrums on the organ injury
induced by I/R using murine models of kidney and liver I/R. The primary a
priori hypothesis is that high-illuminance blue spectrum light reduces kidney
and liver organ injury from I/R, by comparison with high-illuminance red and
standard illuminance, ambient, white fluorescent light. The primary end-
points are serum cystatin C and ALT concentrations, as validated markers of
renal and hepatic cellular injury.
Reagents. Antibodies for HMGB1 (ab79823) and tubulin (ab4074) were
obtained from Abcam. The β3 agonist CL316,243 and β3 antagonist SR
59230A were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
Animal experimentation. We used 8- to 12-wk-old male C57BL/6J, 129S1/Sv-
Vsx2or-J/J (Vsx2, visual system homeobox 2), and their control 129S1/SvImJ
mice (The Jackson Laboratory). Homozygous 129S1/Sv-Vsx2or-J/J mice exhibit
abnormal eye development: microphthalmia, small lens, and absence of the
optic nerve; otherwise, these mice are fertile and exhibit no other phenotypic
abnormalities (19). All experimentation was initiated at CT2 (CT, circadian time
set 0 as previous dawn and 12 previous dusk). All animals had ad libitum access
to water and LabDiet Prolab IsoPro RMH 3000 diet pellets (LabDiet).
Liver I/R. A segmental (70%) hepatic warm I/R with 60 min of ischemia was
used as previously performed (23).
Renal I/R. A unilateral renal I/R model was used (53). A laparotomy was
performed, the left kidney was exposed, and the renal pedicle was occluded
for 30 min. Reperfusion was then initiated, the contralateral kidney was
removed, and the abdomen closed.
The temperature during ischemia was maintained at 31 °C using a warming
incubator chamber. At the end of 6 h (liver I/R) or 24 h (renal I/R) of reperfusion,
the mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and killed by exsanguination.
For all studies, one investigator allocated each mouse to a single light
exposure and a second investigator, blinded to the lighting conditions,
performed the surgical experimentation and collected the samples. An in-
vestigator blinded to the specific treatment analyzed the data.
Exposure to light. All experiments were conducted in a climatic room main-
tained on a day–night 12:12 h light:dark cycle (lights on from 0800 to 2000
hours) at an ambient temperature of 23 ± 2 °C and a relative humidity of
60%. Mice were randomly assigned to one of three different spectral illu-
minances: red (617 nm, 1,400 lx), blue (442 nm, 1,400 lx), and ambient light
(fluorescent white light, 400 lx) (SI Materials and Methods). For hepatic and
renal I/R these lighting environments were administered continuously for
the 24-h period preceding experimentation and the respective 6- and 24-h
periods of reperfusion. We continuously measured cage temperature
and demonstrate that the heat emission modestly affected the cage
temperatures (25 ± 2 °C; Fig. S3). Illuminance was measured with a hand-
held digital lux meter (Digital Light Level Meter LX1330B; Mastech).
Spectroradiometric measurements were made with an ISP-80-8-I in-
tegrating sphere (Ocean Optics).
Heart rate variability. Mice underwent laparotomy and implantation of a DSI
HD-X11 wireless telemetry monitor (DSI) within the peritoneal cavity as
previously published (SI Materials and Methods) (54). The HD-X11 is a reusable
2.2-g, 1.4-cc wireless telemetry device capable of continuous measurement of
one biopotential (e.g., electrocardiogram) and animal activity. After a 24-h
period of recovery, mice were exposed to blue and red spectrum light and
monitored for 24 h. Data collection and analysis were performed using
Ponemah version 5.20 (DSI). Frequency domain parameters of heart rate var-
iability, specifically the LF/HF ratio, were calculated as published (34–38).
Organ physiology. Serum ALT concentration was determined using a DRI-CHEM
4000 Chemistry Analyzer System (Heska) (23). Renal function was determined
by assaying serum for cystatin C [interassay coefficient of variability (CV):
2.8%] using an enzyme immunoassay kit (R&D) (55).
Histology. The extent of parenchymal necrosis was graded using H&E-stained
histological sections at 200× magnification with evaluation of 10 fields per
sample (SI Materials and Methods).

 Immunoblot and HMGB1 concentration. Serum was electrophoresed in a 15%
SDS/PAGE gel and developed as previously described (23). Densitometry was
performed by the NIH Image program (NIH) (56).
Melatonin and corticosterone concentrations. Serum melatonin concentration
was quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (interassay CV:
6.5%; IBL). Serum corticosterone concentration was determined by an en-
zyme immunoassay kit (interassay CV: 2.5%; Enzo Life Science).
Myeloperoxidase. MPO concentration was determined using an ELISA assay kit
(interassay CV: 7.6%; Hycult Biotech).
Statistics. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 12SE software.
Values are expressed as medians. Groups are compared by Mann–Whitney
rank sum. A P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Study approval. We performed all animal experiments in accordance with the NIH
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals under protocols approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pittsburgh.
