have not found this to be the case. Because of the continued
uncertainty, we sought to assess the association between cir-

tative sample of Medicare beneficiaries.
Methods
Study Design
We performed a retrospective cohort study of 1 618 059 Medi-
care beneficiaries using a 5% sample of inpatient and outpa-
tient claims from January 1, 2008, through December 31, 2014.
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services provide health
insurance to most US residents starting at 65 years of age. Ben-

IMPORTANCE Cirrhosis is associated with hemorrhagic and thrombotic extrahepatic
complications. The risk of cerebrovascular complications is less well understood.
OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between cirrhosis and various stroke types.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We performed a retrospective cohort study using
inpatient and outpatient Medicare claims data from January 1, 2008, through December 31,
2014, for a random 5% sample of 1 618 059 Medicare beneficiaries older than 66 years.
EXPOSURES Cirrhosis, as defined by a validated diagnosis code algorithm.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was stroke, and secondary outcomes
were ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage as defined by
validated diagnosis code algorithms.
RESULTS Among 1 618 059 beneficiaries, 15 586 patients (1.0%) had cirrhosis (mean [SD] age,
74.1 [6.9] years; 7263 [46.6%] female). During a mean (SD) of 4.3 (1.9) years of follow-up,
77 268 patients were hospitalized with a stroke. The incidence of stroke was 2.17% (95% CI,
1.99%-2.36%) per year in patients with cirrhosis and 1.11% (95% CI, 1.10%-1.11%) per year in
patients without cirrhosis. After adjustment for demographic characteristics and stroke risk
factors, patients with cirrhosis had a higher risk of stroke (hazard ratio [HR], 1.4; 95% CI,
1.3-1.5). The magnitude of association appeared to be higher for intracerebral hemorrhage
(HR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.5-2.4) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (HR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.7-3.5) than for
ischemic stroke (HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2-1.5).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In a nationally representative sample of Medicare
beneficiaries, cirrhosis was associated with an increased risk of stroke, particularly
hemorrhagic stroke. A potential explanation of these findings implicates the mixed
coagulopathy observed in cirrhosis.

 ters are made available in deidentified data sets by the Cen-
ters for Medicare & Medicaid Services for research purposes.13
Each beneficiary is given an anonymous identifier code so that
longitudinal analyses can be performed. Up to 25 Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modi-
fication(ICD-9-CM)diagnosiscodes,6ICD-9-CMinpatientpro-
cedure codes, and 13 Current Procedural Terminology inpatient
or outpatient procedure codes are provided for each encoun-
ter. Although some granular data, such as medication use and
laboratory results, are not included, administrative claims data
allow for population-based epidemiologic studies of putative
stroke risk factors, especially those with relatively low prev-
alence,14 such as cirrhosis.15 We adhered to the Report of Stud-
ies Conducted Using Observational Routinely Collected Health
Data guidelines for studies using administrative claims data.16
One of the investigators (H.K.) was responsible for data set ac-
quisitionanddatastewardship.Thisstudywasapprovedbythe
Weill Cornell Medicine Institutional Review Board, which
deemed that informed consent was not required.
Patient Population
To facilitate longitudinal analysis, we followed the conven-
tion of limiting our cohort to beneficiaries with at least 1 year
of continuous Medicare coverage (Parts A and B).17 We fur-
ther refined our cohort by including beneficiaries only after 1
year of coverage eligibility to allow time for beneficiaries’rec-
ords to accrue claims that reflected their baseline comorbidi-
ties, such as prior stroke. Thus, patients with a diagnosis of
stroke before 1 year of coverage eligibility were excluded.
Measurements
Our primary predictor was cirrhosis, defined by an algorithm
that requires the presence of at least 1 ICD-9-CM inpatient or
outpatient claim for cirrhosis or its complications.18 The spe-
cific codes included were 571.2, 571.5, 572.2, 572.3, 572.4,
456.0, 456.1, 456.20, 456.21, and 567.23. We slightly modi-
fied this approach by excluding the diagnosis code for ascites
because it has poor specificity19 and by requiring at least 2
claims for cirrhosis or its complications for beneficiaries in-
cluded on the basis of outpatient codes alone. The original ap-
proach has 67% sensitivity and 88% positive predictive value
foridentifyingcirrhosisandhasbeenusedinthestudyofMedi-
care data.18 Administrative claims data have been used to iden-
tify patients with cirrhosis with good reliability in multiple ad-
ditional settings.19-21 In secondary analyses, we analyzed
separately beneficiaries with alcohol-related and non–alcohol-
related cirrhosis, for which individual ICD-9-CM diagnosis
codes have also been validated to have fair accuracy.19 Non–
alcohol-related cirrhosis includes metabolic and infectious cir-
rhosis. In addition, we analyzed separately beneficiaries with
decompensated cirrhosis, defined as the presence of an indi-
vidual diagnosis code for alcohol-related or non–alcohol-
related cirrhosis in addition to a diagnosis code for any de-
compensationevent.20Thisalgorithmhasapositivepredictive
value of 91% for hepatic decompensation.20 We did not in-
clude patients with biliary cirrhosis in our analyses because
of the diagnosis code’
s low specificity.19 To prevent detection
bias, we ascertained only cirrhosis diagnoses documented be-
foretheoccurrenceofstrokeanddidnotincludecirrhosisdocu-
mented for the first time during the stroke hospitalization.
The primary outcome was hospital admission for any
stroke, and the secondary outcomes were hospital admission
for ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and sub-
arachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Outcomes were defined by vali-
dated ICD-9-CM algorithms, which required the presence of
the following diagnosis codes in any discharge diagnosis po-
sition: ischemic stroke codes 433.x1, 434.x1, or 436, ICH code
431, and SAH code 430.22 For all outcomes, the diagnosis code
algorithms were designed to facilitate ascertainment of inci-
dent stroke by excluding claims with concomitant codes for
rehabilitation.Forhemorrhagicstrokeoutcomes,patientswith
concomitant diagnosis codes for trauma were excluded to ex-
clude patients with traumatic ICH and SAH. The ICD-9-CM di-
agnosis code algorithm for identifying ischemic stroke is 86%
sensitive and 95% specific.22 The code used to identify ICH is
82% sensitive and 93% specific, and the code used to identify
SAH is 98% sensitive and 92% specific.22 Transient ischemic
attack was not included as an outcome.
Additional covariates were demographic characteristics
and traditional stroke risk factors and comorbidities. Pa-
tients’age, sex, and race/ethnicity (as reported by the patient
or surrogate) were determined from the Medicare denomina-
tor file. The following traditional stroke risk factors and rel-
evant comorbidities were ascertained using ICD-9-CM codes:
hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery dis-
ease, congestive heart failure, valvular disease, peripheral vas-
cular disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease, alcohol abuse, and tobacco use.23-26
Statistical Analysis

Key Points
Questions Do patients with cirrhosis experience an increased risk
of stroke, and does the risk differ by stroke type?
Findings In this cohort study of 1 618 059 Medicare beneficiaries,
patients with cirrhosis faced an increased risk of stroke, and
associations appeared stronger for hemorrhagic stroke than for
ischemic stroke.
Meaning Patients with cirrhosis face an increased risk of stroke,
particularly hemorrhagic stroke. These findings in a vascular bed
that is independent of portal hypertension may reflect the clinical
implications of the mixed coagulopathy observed in cirrhosis.

 tors and comorbidities. All covariates were included in Cox
proportional hazards regression models regardless of signifi-
cance at the univariate level.
We performed 2 prespecified sensitivity analyses to test
the robustness of our results by further refining our cohort of
patients with cirrhosis. First, we used provider codes to limit
our cohort of patients with cirrhosis to those diagnosed by a
gastroenterologist. Second, we used procedure codes to limit
our cohort of patients with cirrhosis to those who had under-
gone abdominal imaging or biopsy of the liver.
We performed several post hoc analyses. First, we deter-
mined the association of mild, noncirrhotic liver disease with
our outcomes. Mild liver disease was identified using ICD-
9-CM codes selected from its Charlson Comorbidity Index
definition.27 Second, we repeated our primary analysis while
additionallyadjustingforalltheremainingcomorbiditieslisted
in the Charlson Comorbidity Index.28 Third, we determined
the association between cirrhosis and embolic vs nonem-
bolic stroke. Embolic stroke was defined by ICD-9-CM code
434.11, which is reasonably specific.29 Fourth, we limited our
outcomes to stroke diagnoses with a concomitant procedure
code for brain imaging during the hospitalization. Fifth, we
separately examined associations with fatal vs nonfatal stroke.
Statisticalanalyseswereperformed(H.K.)usingSTATA/MP
software, version 13 (StataCorp). The threshold of statistical
significance was set at α = .05.
Results
Among the 1 618 059 beneficiaries in our sample, we identi-
fied 15 586 patients (1.0%) with cirrhosis (mean [SD] age, 74.1
[6.9] years; 7263 [46.6%] female). Compared with patients
without cirrhosis, patients with cirrhosis were more fre-
quently male and had higher rates of stroke risk factors
(Table1).Duringamean(SD)follow-upof4.3(1.9)years,77 268
patients were hospitalized with stroke. Patients with stroke
were older, were more often female, and had a higher burden
of stroke risk factors (Table 2). During the duration of follow-
up, 198 293 patients (12.3%) in the cohort were censored be-
cause of a change in insurance status.
The incidence of stroke was 2.17% (95% CI, 1.99%-2.36%)
per year among patients with cirrhosis and 1.11% (95% CI,
1.10%-1.11%)peryearamongpatientswithoutcirrhosis(Figure).
The annual incidence of ischemic stroke was 1.80% (95% CI,
1.64%-1.98%) among patients with cirrhosis and 0.96% (95%
CI, 0.96%-0.97%) among patients without cirrhosis. The an-
nualincidenceofICHwas0.31%(95%CI,0.25%-0.39%)among
patientswithcirrhosisand0.14%(95%CI,0.13%-0.14%)among
patients without cirrhosis. Last, the annual incidence of SAH
was 0.13% (95% CI, 0.09%-0.18%) among patients with cir-
rhosisand0.04%(95%CI,0.04%-0.05%)amongpatientswith-
out cirrhosis.
In the primary analysis after adjustment for demographic
characteristics, stroke risk factors, and relevant comorbidi-
ties, patients with cirrhosis experienced a higher risk of any
stroke (hazard ratio [HR], 1.4; 95% CI, 1.3-1.5). However, the
degree of association appeared to be higher for ICH (HR, 1.9;
95% CI, 1.5-2.4) and SAH (HR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.7-3.5) than for
ischemic stroke (HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2-1.5). In terms of ischemic
stroke subtypes, cirrhosis was weakly associated with non-
embolic stroke (HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.3-1.5) and not associated
with embolic stroke (HR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.8-1.3). In secondary
analyses in which alcohol-related and non–alcohol-related

 cirrhosis were the predictors of interest, 3255 patients with
alcohol-related and 11 164 patients with non–alcohol-related
cirrhosis were identified. In this analysis, results were largely
consistent with the primary analysis (Table 3) with the excep-
tion of the risk of SAH in patients with alcohol-related cirrho-
sis, for which the HR was not statistically significant (HR, 1.6;
95% CI, 0.7-4.0). In addition, 6043 patients with decompen-
sated cirrhosis were identified, for whom the risk of stroke
and all individual stroke types appeared to be slightly higher
(Table 3). In contrast, mild liver disease was not associated
with stroke (HR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7-0.8), ischemic stroke (HR,
0.7; 95% CI, 0.7-0.8), ICH (HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.96-1.4), or SAH
(HR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.8-1.6).
In sensitivity analyses, we separately analyzed 5542 pa-
tients diagnosed with cirrhosis by a gastroenterologist and
13 384 patients with cirrhosis who had undergone abdominal
imaging or liver biopsy; results were consistent with the pri-
mary analysis (Table 3). We performed a number of post hoc
sensitivity analyses. Adjustment for additional comorbidi-
ties did not significantly change our results. The results of the
primary analysis were unchanged when we required docu-
mentation of brain imaging at the time of an outcome. Last,

Discussion
Inalarge,nationallyrepresentativesampleofMedicarebenefi-
ciaries,wefoundthatpatientswithcirrhosisfacedanincreased
risk of stroke after adjustment for patient demographic charac-
teristics,traditionalstrokeriskfactors,andrelevantcomorbidi-
ties.Cirrhosisappearedtobemorestronglyassociatedwithhem-
orrhagic stroke than ischemic stroke. Similar associations were
seen regardless of cirrhosis type, although decompensated cir-
rhosis appeared to have the strongest association with stroke.
To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study
of the association between cirrhosis and various stroke types
in a large, representative sample. A prior smaller study7 that
sought to clarify this association exclusively in patients with
non–alcohol-related cirrhosis found, in contrast to our re-
sults, that cirrhosis was associated with a lower risk of stroke.
Although the risk of ischemic stroke in that study was signifi-
cantlyloweramongpatientswithcirrhosis,hemorrhagicstroke
risk was not statistically significantly lower. Important differ-
ences in study design and patient characteristics may explain
our discrepant findings. The study by Chen et al7 used a single
diagnosis code to include only patients with non–alcohol-
related cirrhosis, whereas we used a validated algorithm to in-
clude patients with various forms of cirrhosis. In addition, the
patientsinourstudycohortwereolder,weremorediverse,and
had a greater burden of baseline stroke risk factors. Other com-
pelling data regarding specific stroke subtypes are limited.
Small studies8,9 have suggested a reduced prevalence and in-
cidence of ischemic stroke in patients with cirrhosis. With re-
gard to hemorrhagic stroke, early studies11,12 reported con-
flicting results. However, a subsequent study10 demonstrated
an independent association between liver disease, including
cirrhosis,andtheriskofintracranialhemorrhage,butthisstudy
was limited by the lack of outpatient data. In this context, our
findings challenge the weakly supported notion that cirrho-

 sis is protective against ischemic stroke and complement in-
creasing evidence of an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke
in patients with cirrhosis, particularly in the context of ad-
vanced age and multiple vascular risk factors.
Our finding of an increased risk of stroke among patients
with cirrhosis has multiple possible explanations. There is in-
creasing evidence that cirrhosis is accompanied by a mixed co-
agulopathy with potential implications for hemorrhagic and
thrombotic processes.30 Clinically, cirrhosis is often associ-
ated with bleeding complications, most commonly portal hy-
pertensive hemorrhage in the gastrointestinal tract.1 Patients
with liver fibrosis were also recently found to have an in-
creased burden of cerebral microhemorrhages on brain mag-
neticresonanceimaging.31Ourfindingsfurthersupportahem-
orrhagic tendency in cirrhosis that is independent of portal
hypertension. On the other hand, a propensity for venous
thromboembolism in cirrhosis is increasingly recognized.2,3 At
a minimum, cirrhosis does not appear to be protective against
thrombotic events.32 Studies33-35 of coagulation factors in pa-
tients with cirrhosis have revealed an unstable imbalance of
prothrombotic and prohemorrhagic derangements. The in-
creased risk of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke observed in
our study may reflect these complex coagulation system ab-
errations, particularly for patients with more advanced, de-
compensatedcirrhosisbecausethesepatientsappearedtohave
a higher risk of all stroke types. The risk of stroke conferred
by the patients’underlying vascular risk factors may be am-
plified by cirrhosis, perhaps because of the mixed coagulop-
athy. The underlying causes of cirrhosis, such as alcohol abuse,
hepatitis C infection, and metabolic disease, may also contrib-
ute to stroke risk, although we did not find mild, noncirrhotic
liver disease to be associated with stroke. Alternatively, with
regard to ischemic stroke, clinicians’perceptions of the risk of
bleeding or further hepatic toxicity may limit the aggressive-
nessofstrokepreventionwithantithromboticmedicationsand
statin therapy, for example. Last, although we adjusted for
baseline stroke risk factors, it is possible that cirrhosis re-
flectspoorhealthingeneralandthatresidualconfoundingcon-
tributedtoourfindings.However,residualconfoundingwould
not explain the seemingly stronger associations with hemor-
rhagic compared with ischemic stroke. Furthermore, our find-
ings were unchanged when adjusting for additional comor-
bidities. In addition, the magnitude of the associations for ICH
and SAH and the robustness of these associations in sensitiv-
ity analyses make confounding less likely in those cases.
Limitations
We adhered to relevant guidelines on the use of administra-
tive claims data.16 However, a number of inherent limitations
warrant mention. First, the diagnosis code algorithm used to
ascertain cirrhosis prioritizes positive predictive value over
sensitivity.18 It is possible that some patients in the control
group also had cirrhosis; however, this bias serves to increase
the confidence in our findings. The generalizability of our re-
sults to mild cirrhosis may be limited because the diagnosis
codealgorithmusedtoascertaincirrhosisintheprimaryanaly-
sis includes some patients based on the presence of compli-
cations of cirrhosis. Although our results were largely un-
changed in secondary analyses of patients with alcohol-
related and non–alcohol-related cirrhosis regardless of the
presence or absence of complications, the associations with
stroke appeared to be weaker in a post hoc analysis of pa-
tients with mild, noncirrhotic liver disease. Regardless, the in-
ability to ascertain the duration of cirrhosis before inclusion
in our cohort is an additional limitation because rates of stroke
may be lower during this period. Second, vascular risk factor
ascertainment may be incomplete, although this limitation is
expectedtobeequallypresentinthecontrolgroup.Third,rela-
tively few patients had alcohol-related cirrhosis; thus, this sec-
ondary analysis may have been underpowered, which may
have contributed to the nonsignificant and imprecise associa-
tion observed with SAH. Fourth, there may be misclassifica-
tionamongoutcomes.However,weusedareliablealgorithm22
to identify outcomes; furthermore, our results were un-
changed in an analysis that required documentation of brain
imaging at the time of stroke diagnosis. Similarly, although we
used strategies to exclude patients with prior stroke, we can-
notbecertainthatalloutcomeswerefirst-everoutcomes.Fifth,
because our analysis was of Medicare beneficiaries, our re-
sults may not be generalizable to younger patients. Sixth, the
fact that 12.3% of our cohort was censored because of a change
in insurance is also a limitation. Seventh, we cannot deter-
minetheassociationofantithromboticmedicationuseorlabo-
ratory derangements with our predictors and outcomes be-
cause the Medicare data set used for our analysis does not
include these data. Additional research to delineate whether
and to what extent such variables mediate the association be-
tween cirrhosis and stroke is warranted.
Conclusions
In a nationally representative sample of elderly patients with
vascular risk factors, cirrhosis was associated with an in-
creased risk of stroke, particularly hemorrhagic stroke. Addi-
tional investigation into the epidemiology and pathophysiol-
ogy of this association may yield opportunities for stroke risk
reduction and prevention.
