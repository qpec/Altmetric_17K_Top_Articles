BACKGROUND: Frameless, non-isocentric irradiation of an extended segment of the
trigeminal nerve introduces new concepts in stereotactic radiosurgery for medically
resistant trigeminal neuralgia (TN).
OBJECTIVE: To report the results of the largest single-center experience about image-
guided robotic radiosurgery for TN.
METHODS: A cohort of 138 patients treated with CyberKnife R
� (Accuray Incorporated,
Sunnyvale, California) radiosurgery with a minimum follow-up of 36 mo were recruited.
Pain relief, medications, sensory disturbances, rate and time of pain recurrence were
prospectively analyzed.
RESULTS: Median follow-up was 52.4 mo; median dose 75 Gy; median target length 5.7-
mm; median target volume 40 mm3; median prescription dose 60 Gy (80% isodose line).
Actuarial pain control rate (Barrow Neurological Institute [BNI] class I-IIIa) at 6, 12, 24, and
36 mo were 93.5%, 85.8%, 79.7%, and 76%, respectively. Overall, 33 patients (24%) required
a second treatment.
Overall, 18.1% developed sensory disturbances after 16.4 ± 8.7 mo. One patient
(0.7%) developed BNI grade IV dysfunction; 6 (4.3%) developed BNI grade III (somewhat
bothersome) hypoesthesia after retreatment; BNI grade II (not bothersome) hypoesthesia
was reported by 18 patients (11 after retreatment). Shorter nerve length (<6 mm vs 6 mm),
smallernervevolume(<30mm3 vs>30mm3),andlowerprescriptiondose(<58vs>58Gy)
were associated with treatment failure (P = .01, P = .02, P = .03, respectively). Re-irradiation
independently predicted sensory disturbance (P < .001).
CONCLUSION: Targeting a 6-mm segment of the trigeminal nerve with a prescribed
dose of 60 Gy appears safe and effective. Persistent pain control was achieved in most
patients with acceptable risk of sensory complications, which were typically found after
re-irradiation.

a
frameless
radiosurgery
technique.16-18,28,30,31 In a limited number of series, CyberKnife
radiosurgery proved to be an effective and minimally invasive
modality to perform retrogasserian rhizotomy. Because of the
non-isocentric geometry of CyberKnife radiation delivery,
it provides the possibility of homogeneous irradiation of an
extended segment of the trigeminal nerve, thereby introducing
new options for the radiosurgical treatment of TN.19–21 Available
data are limited by either the numbers of patients or a relatively
short follow-up17,22,23 or multicentric and heterogeneous experi-
ences.18,24
Objectives
Here, we report the results obtained in the largest series of
patients treated in a single center with fixed treatment param-
eters and followed up longer than 36 mo. The safety and effec-
tiveness of CyberKnife radiosurgery for TN were analyzed in a
homogenous and prospectively followed cohort. Optimal dose
and volume (length of the nerve treated) were analyzed in relation
to pain response, complications, and recurrence of symptoms to
identify and recommend best practice.
METHODS
Setting and Study Design
Patients presenting with medically intractable TN between November
2010 and March 2014, the treated, were included in this study. Data were
prospectively analyzed. All patients were followed up, according to our
prospective protocol, for more than 3 yr.
Participants
Patients fulfilling the criteria of the International Headache Society
(2003)25 for TN who received frameless radiosurgery for medically
resistant pain were included in this study. The Local Ethics Committee
approved this study and all patients signed a written consent.
Variables
The type of trigeminal pain was evaluated according to the classifi-
cation proposed by Eller et al.26 Pain was classified as typical (TN1),
described as sharp, shooting, electrical shock-like, with pain-free intervals
between the attacks. It was classified as atypical (TN2) in patients
describing pain as an aching, throbbing, or burning for more than 50%
of the time and constant in nature (constant background pain being the
most significant attribute).
Radiosurgical Technique
Immobilization and Imaging
Patients were treated with SRS using a CyberKnife G4 model (Accuray
Inc). Before the treatment, the patient lay supine on the treatment couch
and a custom-fitted thermoplastic mask (Orfit
R
� Industries America, New
York, New York) was molded. For all patients, a thin-slice contrast-
enhanced computed tomography (CT) scanning and T1-weiged and
constructive interference in steady state (CISS) magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) were performed (see Appendix, Supplemental Digital
Content for details).
Target and Dose Selection
CT and MRI datasets were coregistered and the quality of the coregis-
tration was visually checked using multiple views and transparency tools
of the treatment planning system (MultiPlan
R
�, Accuray Inc). The Gasser
ganglion and the retrogasserian portion of the trigeminal nerve on the
MRI and a bony canal on the edge of the petrous bone, clearly marking
the ostium of Meckel’s cave, were identified. This point could be immedi-
ately and constantly identifiable on 0.75 mm thin CT slices in axial
view and then checked on the sagittal and coronal view using a crosshair.
Shifting the imaging from the CT to the MRI, the pars triangularis was
pointed out. An elongated target, 6 mm long and including the lateral
margins of the nerve, was drawn on 2 or 3 slices depending on the nerve
thickness. The brainstem, the mesial temporal lobe, the acoustic and
facial nerves, the cochlea, and semicircular canals were specifically delin-
eated as critical structures to minimize the radiation dose with an inverse
planning algorithm. Other critical volumes, including the eyes, lenses,
optic nerves, whole brain, and skin were also delineated for dose calcu-
lations. Furthermore, 2 tuning structures were delineated at 3-mm and
10-mm distances to restrict the isodose distribution outside the target
within a precise distance.
A non-isocentric beams distribution was chosen; the maximum dose
was 75 Gy. The maximum point dose to the brainstem and medial
temporal lobe were set at 15 Gy and 36 Gy, respectively. Eight Gy was
the maximum dose allowed to the cranial nerves, whereas 4 Gy was the
limit to the middle ear. The outermost tuning structure (10 mm outside
the target) had a dose limit of 15 Gy.
Once the calculation was completed, we verified that a 6-mm segment
of the trigeminal nerve was included in the 80% isodose line (60 Gy).
The maximum volume eventually included in the 80% isodose line was
determined by individual anatomy, the length of nerve and relative dose
received by the brainstem and mesial temporal lobe. For shorter nerves,
we moved the target forward, toward the Gasserian ganglion, but always
within the root. If this was not sufficient to obey the dose limit to the
brainstem, we forced the inverse plan by allowing a smaller portion of the
nerve to be included within the 60 Gy isodose line. Overall, the planning
process required 45 to 90 min.
Data Sources
Clinical and treatment data were prospectively collected in a digital
archive. Follow-up information was obtained by outpatient clinical
evaluation or telephone interviews at defined time intervals.
Bias
To avoid inconsistent interpretation, clinical results were evaluated
according to numerical scales and a score was assigned at each patient
at different time points.
Study Size
In this cohort study, all patients fulfilling inclusion criteria who
reached at least 36 mo follow-up were included.
Assessment of Outcome
The end-points analyzed were: (i) effects on pain scores, (ii) effects
on medication, (iii) latency to pain reduction, (iv) occurrence of sensory
disturbance, and (v) rate and time of pain recurrence.

 FRAMELESS RADIOSURGERY FOR TRIGEMINAL NEURALGIA
Quantitative Variables
Pain level was scored using the Barrow Neurological Institute scale
(BNI; class I: no trigeminal pain, no medication; II: occasional pain,
not requiring medication; IIIa: no pain, continued medication; IIIb:
controlled with medication; IV: some pain, not adequately controlled
with medication; V: severe pain, no pain relief)27. For hypoes-
thesia evaluation, we used the BNI facial hypoesthesia scale (class I:
no facial numbness; II: mild facial numbness, not bothersome; III:
facial numbness, somewhat bothersome; IV: facial numbness, very
bothersome)27.
We also recorded any possible trigeminal motor deficits. All patients
were interviewed and a specific question was posed about a possible
weakness or pain during mastication. Throughout outpatient assessment,
the strength and the tone of masseter muscles against light resistance were
evaluated. The jaw jerk reflex and the presence of fasciculation of chewing
muscles were assessed as well.
Statistical Methods
For evaluation of outcomes such as initial pain cessation and recur-
rence, time to event was estimated by using the Kaplan–Meier method.
Contingency tables (Fisher’s exact test) were used to compare categorical
variables in univariate analysis. A multivariate logistic regression analysis
was then performed to identify predictive factors among the collected
variables. Multivariate analysis was performed using the multiple logistic
regression method. Variables showing statistical significance in the
univariate analysis were transformed into binary variables to be used in
the logistic regression model. To perform analyses, STATCALC 7.1.1
software (AcaStat, Poinciana, Florida) was used. Values of P < .05 were
considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Participants
In the considered period, a cohort of 138 patients presenting
with medically intractable TN were recruited. An ipsilateral
neurovascular conflict was disclosed in 63% of those patients.
These patients were provided with all relevant information
about the different surgical treatments and in particular about
the suitability of MVD for their case. They were eventually
deemed candidates for radiosurgical treatment because they were
considered at risk for major surgery or for a resolute personal
preference. Table 1 summarizes our preoperative demographic
and clinical data.
Descriptive Data
Preoperatively, all patients had severe pain with numerical
rating scale (NRS) score of >6 (median score 9) and were
in BNI class IV (33%) or V (67%). Six patients (4.3%) had
multiple sclerosis. A neurovascular conflict was visible on MRI in
87/138 patients (63%). Twelve patients had undergone previous
rhizotomy (SRS or percutaneous techniques). Two patients had
undergone MVD (1.4%).
Pain was classified as TN1 in 124/138 patients (89.8%). Pain
was referred to the right side in 62% and to left side in 38% of
the patients. Sixty-three percent had V3 involvement, 70% had

Main Results
Radiosurgical Accuracy
Monthly tests of the 6D Skull Tracking mode demonstrated a
median total treatment error (TTE) of 0.30 ± 0.12 mm. Median
vertical deviation was measured as 0.4 mm; median horizontal
deviation was 0.2 mm. Thus, even in the presence of planned
displacements of target position, the system delivered the sub-
millimetric accuracy necessary for the treatment of TN.
Target and Treatment Data
All treatments were performed in a single fraction using a non-
isocentric technique. The median prescription isodose line was
80% (mean 82.9% ± 3.2) accounting for a mean radiation dose
of 59.3 ± 2.7 Gy (median 60 Gy; Figure 1). The isodose incorpo-
rated a segment of the trigeminal root with a median length of 5.7
mm (mean 5.7 ± 1.6 mm). The median nerve volume included in
the prescription isodose was 40.6 mm3 (mean 29 ± 14 mm3). In
16% of patients (22/138 pts), because of a short cisternal segment

of the trigeminal nerve, the final target turned out to be as short
as 4 mm with a median volume of 28 mm3.
The median maximum dose was 75 Gy (range, 65-75 Gy). The
median new conformation index was 1.9 (mean 2 ± 0.62); the
median homogeneity index was 1.25. Median number of beams
was 105 (range, 90-110); median number of nodes was 87 (range,
85-90). Treatment time, including patient set up, ranged from 45
to 55 min with beam on time ranging from 15 to 21 min.
Pain Control
The median follow-up was 52.4 mo (range, 36-79 mo). After a
median 3 wk (range, 1-6 wk), significant pain relief (a decrease
in NRS score of >5) was achieved in 129 of 138 (93.5%)
patients (Figure 2). One hundred twenty-nine patients (93.5%)
were able to decrease the dose of medications intended to control
pain throughout follow-up and finally ceased pain medication.
One hundred nine patients (78.9%) were completely pain and
medication free (BNI pain class I) within 6 mo after treatment.
Twenty-four of 129 (18.6%) pain-free patients experienced
recurrent pain within 3 yr from the treatment. Peak of recurrent
pain was reached at 12 mo after the first procedure (12 patients),
while another 7 recurred at 18 mo and 5 at 24 mo (Figure 3).
Therefore, the actuarial portion of pain-free patients (BNI score of
I-IIIa) was 93.5% at 6 mo, 85.8% at 12 mo, 79.7% at 18 mo, and
76% at 24 mo. The percentage remained stable the later follow-
ups. Figure 3 shows the rate of pain control after treatment.

 FRAMELESS RADIOSURGERY FOR TRIGEMINAL NEURALGIA
FIGURE 3. Actuarial rate of pain relief after the first
radiosurgery treatment.
Salvage Therapy
Nine patients (6.5%) who failed to achieve pain control after
a minimum of 6 mo underwent a second CyberKnife (Accuray
Inc) treatment. Twenty-four of 129 pain-free patients (18.6%)
experienced recurrent pain within 3 yr from the treatment and
underwent retreatment. Overall, retreatments were performed
in 33 patients to the same target, 6 mm of the retrogasserian
to mid-cisternal segment of the trigeminal nerve, and the same
dose/volume characteristics: 60 Gy median prescription dose and
75 Gy median maximum dose. All 33 patients achieved pain
control (BNI pain scores I-IIIa) at the last follow-up. Nevertheless,
re-irradiation alone was effective in 20 out of 33 patients (61%).
Six patients required radiofrequency rhizotomy; 7 underwent
MVD with partial rhizotomy.
Sensory Dysfunction and Other Complications
Six patients developed a BNI numbness scale grade III
(somewhat bothersome) hypoesthesia, exclusively following re-
irradiation. This corresponds to 4.3% of the entire cohort of
138 patients and 18.2% of the 33 patients who received a
second treatment. One further patient (0.7%) developed BNI
numbness scale grade IV hypoesthesia after the first treatment.
This patient had a pontine myelopathy, visible on T2-weighted
MRI. The treatment plan of this patient was carefully reviewed.
We concluded that a portion of the brainstem received a dose
higher than that intended as a consequence of a very short
cisternal segment. As a result, the brainstem received a high point
dose despite the volume receiving 10 Gy and that receiving 12 Gy
corresponded to 1.5% and 1% of the volume.
Mild, non-bothersome sensory disturbances, ie BNI numbness
scale grade II, were reported by 18 patients (7 after the first and
11 after retreatment), with an overall rate of 18.1% (25 of 138
patients) developing some sensory disturbance, 5% of which were
bothersome, after an average of 16.4 ± 8.7 mo.
No further complications, such as temporal lobe radionecrosis,
anesthesia dolorosa, lockjaw, weakness of the mandible, diplopia,

present series.
Other Analyses
Factors Affecting Outcome
Univariate analysis showed that a shorter nerve length (<6 mm
vs 6 mm, P = .01), smaller nerve volume (<30 mm3 vs >30
mm3, P = .02), and lower prescription dose (<58 vs >58 Gy,
P = .03) were associated with treatment failure. None of the
variables considered above, however, retained statistical signifi-
cance in the multivariate analysis.
Retreatment was the only factor associated with the devel-
opment of post-treatment sensory dysfunction (P < .001).
Re-irradiation retained significance at the multivariate logistic
regression as an independent predictor of bothersome numbness
(P < .0001; Odds Ratio = 40.8, 95% confidence interval = 4.8-
343.3) and of sensory dysfunctions of all categories (P < .001;
Odds Ratio = 4.6, 95% confidence interval = 1.9-11-2). Table 2
summarizes the statistical data.
DISCUSSION
Key Results
This series represents the largest cohort to date reported treated
with the frameless, non-isocentric radiosurgery technique for
primary TN consistently performed by a single surgeon (P
.R.)
using definite treatment constraints. Furthermore, results were
obtained from patients with follow-up longer than 3 yr. According
to these data, 76% of patients benefited from the treatment,
achieving stable pain control (BNI pain class I-IIIa) 3 yr after the
first treatment. Failing patients were salvaged by re-treatment.

 ROMANELLI ET AL
These results are consistent with those reported by the 2 largest
studies on Gamma Knife surgery (Elekta AB).8,15 The Marseille
experience illustrated the results of 497 patients with primary
TN after 1 yr of follow-up. Of these patients, 91% were pain-
free within a median time of 10 d. Pain recurred in 34.4%
of patients.15 In their report on 448 patients, Marshall et al8
described satisfactory pain control in 86% and recurrence in 28%
after 3 mo of follow-up.
On the other hand, 18% of patients reported sensory distur-
bances, which is also in line with the literature. Regis et al28 have
recently updated their original study of 497 patients, reporting the
long-term results of this large group of patients. The rate of new
sensory disturbances was 20.4%.28 Furthermore, in our series,
only 5% of patients had bothersome hypoesthesia and all these
patients but one had received multiple treatments. Therefore, the
risk of bothersome sensory deficit after a single treatment can be
calculated as less than 1% in treatments performed using a retro-
gasserian target and specific dose/volume constraints.
Interpretation
The use of frameless and non-isocentric SRS for the treatment
of TN was first reported by Romanelli et al17 at Stanford, in a
study that was the first clinical demonstration of the submilli-
metric accuracy of image-guided radiosurgery. Almost immediate
pain relief (within days) was found in this first cohort of patients
following the delivery of a prescribed dose ranging from 65
to 70 Gy to a nerve segment up to 11 mm. The irradiation
of such a long nerve segment, however, caused a high rate of
bothersome numbness that developed over time in these patients
and prompted a reduction of dose and length of the nerve treated.
Indeed, the treatment planning for CyberKnife (Accuray
Inc) radiosurgical retrogasserian rhizotomy introduces a number
of novel, yet highly critical treatment planning variables, in
particular the necessity to identify a favorable proportion between
the radiation dose and the target volume of trigeminal nerve.
It has not been easy to determine an optimal dose range for
CyberKnife treatments. In 2008, Villavicencio et al18 published
data from a multicenter study illustrating the results of 95 patients
who underwent CyberKnife radiosurgery. This heterogeneous
study included patients treated with widely different modalities
(isocentric and non-isocentric) as well as doses and treatment
volumes. The median dose used was 75 Gy. Certain variables were
predictive of stable pain relief over pain recurrence including the
median maximum dose (77.5 vs 65 Gy), median minimum dose
(64 vs 52 Gy), and median nerve length treated (4 mm vs 6 mm).
After 2 yr, 50% of the population had excellent results, but 47%
suffered new facial numbness.18 An update from the Stanford
series reported on 46 patients receiving a treatment delivered over
a 6-mm segment of the nerve, with a mean marginal prescription
dose of 58.3 Gy and a mean maximal dose of 73.5 Gy.16
Symptoms disappeared completely in 39 patients (85%). After a
mean follow-up period of 14.7 mo, patient-reported outcomes
that were excellent in 33 patients (72%), good in 11 patients
(24%), and poor in 2 patients (4%). Ipsilateral bothersome facial
numbness (grade III on the BNI numbness scale) was reported in
7 patients (15%).16
The above studies show that CyberKnife radiosurgery (Accuray
Inc) to an elongated segment of the trigeminal nerve is associated
with a very high rate of pain control. Actually, the distinct
advantage of a non-isocentric technique is the ability to define the
target volume based on the individual patient’s anatomy. During
treatment planning, we worked on the size and the position
of the prescription isodose line (averaging 60 Gy). We set the
prescription isodose size to embrace a portion of the nerve of
6 mm. The length and the anatomic characteristics of the nerve
and the relative distance from the brainstem, however, influenced
the final target volume. Eventually, a marginal dose averaging
60 Gy delivered to a segment of the retrogasserian root averaging
5.7 mm in length provided a satisfactory therapeutic ratio with
stable pain control and only 5% suffering bothersome hypoes-
thesia.
Outside the length of the nerve, we would indeed emphasize
the importance of the volume of the nerve receiving the
prescription dose. A volume >30 mm3 was associated with a
higher probability of pain control.
On the other hand, caution must be paid to the doses delivered
to the brainstem. For treatment planning, we set a dose constraint
to the brainstem of 15 Gy. This seems to be lower than most
reports of Gamma Knife treatment (Elekta AB) of TN.7-9,14,29–34
In the series by Massager et al,9 a dose of 90 Gy was delivered
to a target 5 to 8 mm from the brainstem, and the treatment was
planned such that a dose of 13 to 15 Gy was received by less than
1 mm3 and 10 to 12 Gy by less than 10 mm3 of the brainstem.9
In the series in which the root entry zone was targeted, the dose
to the brainstem varied. Dosing could be summarized as follows:
21 to 28 Gy for a maximum dose of 70 Gy, 24 to 40 Gy for
a maximum dose of 80 Gy, and 18 to 57.6 Gy for a maximum
dose of 90 Gy.7,8,14,29–34 Actually, the incidence of numbness
increases with dose escalation to the brainstem. At a maximum
dose of 90 Gy, with the brainstem along either the 30% or 50%
isodose line, the rate of grade 4 to 5 numbness was 10% and 17%,
respectively.34 We set a lower limit considering that the dose to the
brainstem is 1 major cause of sensory disturbances. Nonetheless, 1
patient in our series reported BNI grade IV hypoesthesia after the
first treatment. In that patient, due to a short cisternal segment
of the nerve, the brainstem received a high point dose despite the
volume receiving 10 Gy and that receiving 12 Gy corresponded
to 1.5% (0.2 cc) and 1% (0.14 cc). Therefore, we recommend a
thorough review of dose-volume histogram of the brainstem to
avoid suboptimal dose distributions.
There are some technical aspects of image-guided robotic
radiosurgery that deserve also to be mentioned. With the inverse
planning technique used by the CyberKnife (Accuray Inc)
treatment planning, all brain structures have to be contoured35-37.
All dose-volume histograms were evaluated as the risk of high
doses to sensitive structures, even to those that were distant
from the target, was elevated because of the non-isocentric beam

distribution. In particular, the medial-most portion of the
temporal lobe could receive doses as high as 45 Gy after the initial
planning which then were reduced to <15 Gy/1 mm3 to avoid
late mediotemporal radionecrosis.
One of the main criticisms of the use of CyberKnife (Accuray
Inc) for TN was the necessity to plan on CT cisternography due
to a potentially unsafe MR-CT fusion in the earlier versions of the
system. CT cisternography has been abandoned after the prelim-
inary Stanford experience because later versions of MultiPlan-
TPS (Accuray Inc) provided a rather accurate CT-MR fusion
capability. Also, bony landmarks, indicating the entrance of the
trigeminal nerve root into Meckel’s cave, are easily recognizable
directly on a bone CT scan. The identification of these points
greatly supports a precise co-registration of the CT with MR
sequence.
SRS represents a good option for patients who are candi-
dates for retrogasserian rhizotomy. Other techniques seem to have
worse results in terms of long-term pain control. Recently Alvarez-
Pinzon et al38 compared percutaneous retrogasserian balloon
compression and Gamma Knife radiosurgery (Elekta AB) in 202
patients with multiple sclerosis. Fewer complications and superior
long-term relief were associated with radiosurgery. Similarly,
radiosurgery demonstrated fewer complications than percuta-
neous retrogasserian glycerol rhizotomy in these patients.39
Limitations
Our follow-up length is in line with that of principal studies
describing the efficacy of SRS in TN,7–15 but a very long
term follow-up would be desirable for a definitive evaluation of
the technique. Actually, good to excellent mid-term outcomes
have been reported, but long-term results can be less satis-
factory with up to 60% of patients with some episode of
pain recurrence15,28,40. This is particularly important to obtain
a relevant comparison with MVD. Actually, a neurovascular
conflict structure was detectable on MR of 63% of patients of this
series. These patients would be candidates for MVD, but radio-
surgical treatment was selected for different reasons, including:
patient preference, age, performance status, and other contraindi-
cation for major surgical treatments. All patients were informed
of the short and long-term benefits and risks of both procedures
based on our current knowledge.
CONCLUSION
MVD has proven to provide higher rates of control pain at
short and long term and longer pain-free intervals as compared
with SRS41,42. Nonetheless, in patients who are not candidates for
MVD, SRS may represent the first treatment option for classical
TN, while other invasive rhizotomy techniques should be reserved
for patients with acute, intractable pain requiring immediate
postoperative relief. Using our constraints for dose, volume of the
nerve, and dose to the brainstem, the incidence of bothersome
hypoesthesia was low, whereas a durable pain control was achieved
in 76% of patients. The rarity of bothersome complications and
the fact that frameless radiosurgery represents the less invasive
technique for the surgical treatment of TN provide a particularly
favorable profile for this technique as compared with other non-
medicinal treatments.

COMMENT
T
his article reports a range of standard outcome measures for a
sizable cohort of patients with idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia. The
overall conclusion is that CyberKnife treatment (Accuray Inc) was safe
and effective for this condition. Although the subtle technical differ-
ences between the novel method of radiosurgical rhizotomy presented
here and the more traditional Gamma Knife (Elekta AB) methods
are notable, more study, and even a head to head comparison, is
needed to determine if such differences ultimately correlate with clinical
benefits.
For me, even more important that the specific clinical results being
reported in this series, is the fact that stereotactic targeting of the
trigeminal nerve was done exclusively through image-guidance, ie a
stereotactic frame was not utilized for either targeting or head immobi-
lization. The seeming success of this technical approach reported here
flies in the face of the all too common “belief” that image-guidance is
not sufficiently accurate to target the trigeminal nerve, or for that matter,
other functional brain circuits. Therefore, this article provides important
corroboration that the “prejudice” against the accuracy of image-guided
targeting is a false construct. Yet again the data suggests that the accuracy
of image-guided targeting and delivery of radiosurgery is every bit on par
with frame-based methods.
