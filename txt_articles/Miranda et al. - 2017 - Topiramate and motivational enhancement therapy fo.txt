 is almost nonexistent. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot study to test the 
potential efficacy of topiramate plus motivational enhancement therapy (MET) for treating 
cannabis use among adolescents. Sixty-six heavy cannabis users, ages 15 to 24 years, were 
randomized to one of two 6-week treatment conditions: topiramate plus MET or placebo plus 
MET. Topiramate was titrated over 4-weeks then stabilized at 200 mg/day for two weeks. MET 
was delivered biweekly for a total of 3 sessions. Only 48% of youths randomized to topiramate 
completed the 6-week trial (n=19), compared to 77% of youths in the placebo condition (n=20). 
Adverse medication side effects were the most common reason for withdrawal among participants 
in the topiramate group. Latent growth models showed that topiramate was superior to placebo for 
reducing the number of grams smoked per use day, but it did not improve abstinence rates. The 
same pattern of results was found when values for missing outcomes were imputed. We show that 
topiramate combined with MET demonstrated efficacy for reducing how much cannabis 
adolescents smoked when they used but did not affect abstinence rates. The magnitude of this 
effect was modest, however, and topiramate was poorly tolerated by youths, which calls into 
question the clinical importance of these findings.

Introduction
Cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug in the United States, with the highest 
prevalence of use among adolescents and young adults. One of every 17 high school seniors 
smokes marijuana on a near daily basis, a figure that has remained fairly stable for the past 
two decades despite declines in adolescent alcohol and cigarette use (Johnston et al., 2015). 
Although reasons for the disproportionately high prevalence of cannabis misuse among 
youth are poorly understood, the acute and long-term adverse effects of cannabis in youth 
are well documented (Volkow et al., 2014) and cannabis use accounts for the majority of all 
substance abuse treatment admissions among teenagers (SAMHSA, 2012), underscoring the 
need for effective treatment options for youth.
Several psychosocial interventions are moderately effective for reducing cannabis use 
among adolescents and young adults, including cognitive-behavioral and family therapies 
(Bender et al., 2011) and motivational interviewing (MI; (D’Amico et al., 2008). 
Motivational enhancement therapy (MET) combines MI techniques, such as exploring 
ambivalence about behavior change in a nonjudgmental manner, with personalized feedback. 
In controlled trials, MET was efficacious for reducing cannabis use among treatment-
seeking and nontreatment-seeking adolescents (Dennis et al., 2004; Stephens et al., 2007; 
Walker et al., 2006). Yet, despite promising effects, outcomes are suboptimal for many 
youth. Meta-analyses indicate that while psychosocial interventions are efficacious for 
reducing cannabis use, especially when compared to inactive control conditions, the 
majority of individuals do not experience sustained benefit (Davis et al., 2015). These 
suboptimal outcomes highlight the need for research on ways to augment psychosocial 
treatment effects.

 One potential method for improving treatment response rates is to augment behavioral 
interventions with adjunct pharmacotherapy. Pharmacotherapy trials for treating cannabis 
misuse are few, however, and most, but not all (Mason et al., 2012), have produced null 
findings (Carpenter et al., 2009; Levin et al., 2013; Levin et al., 2011; Levin et al., 2004; 
McRae-Clark et al., 2009; McRae-Clark et al., 2010). Moreover, only two controlled 
pharmacotherapy trials have studied adolescents. The first tested fluoxetine in youths with 
comorbid depression and found no effect (Cornelius et al., 2010). The second tested N-
acetylcysteine, a prodrug of the amino acid cysteine thought to affect glutamate regulation, 
in combination with contingency management and weekly cessation counseling for cannabis 
dependent adolescents. N-acetylcysteine increased the odds of abstinence during the 8-week 
trial, but this effect was not sustained at the 4-week follow up (Gray et al., 2012).
Topiramate is a sulfamate-substituted fructopyranose derivative that reduced alcohol, 
cocaine, and nicotine use in clinical trials with adults (Johnson et al., 2003; Johnson et al., 
2013; Kranzler et al., 2014; Miranda et al., 2008; Miranda et al., 2014; Oncken et al., 2014). 
It has multiple mechanisms of action, including blockade of voltage-sensitive sodium and 
calcium channels, potentiation of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), enhancement of GABAA 
receptor function, antagonism of AMPA/kainate glutamate receptors, and inhibition of 
carbonic anhydrase (Shank et al., 2000; Simeone et al., 2006). Although its effects on 
cannabis use have not been studied, its potentiation of GABA and antagonism of glutamate 
suggest it may be useful for reducing the acute reinforcing effects of cannabis. Cannabinoid 
type 1(CB1) receptors, the primary target of cannabis, are highly present on GABAergic 
interneurons, and modulation of these neurons is generally believed to mediate most of the 
subjective effects of cannabis (Moreira and Lutz, 2008). These receptors are also highly 
expressed on glutamatergic neurons, however, and animal data suggest that glutamatergic 
activity may mediate some of the effects of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) – the primary 
psychoactive constituent of cannabis.
This initial pilot study evaluated the feasibility of combining topiramate with MET for 
treating cannabis misuse among youth. We also evaluated several domains of neurocognitive 
functioning shown to be affected by topiramate in prior studies with adults (Salinsky et al., 
2005) and to a lesser degree with adolescents (Pandina et al., 2010). Heavy cannabis use is 
associated with diminished memory and executive functioning (Bolla et al., 2002; Solowij et 
al., 2002) and difficulties sustaining attention and filtering irrelevant information (Solowij et 
al., 1995). It is therefore clinically important to investigate the effects of topiramate on 
neurocognitive functioning in this population in order to more fully evaluate the potential 
clinical utility of this adjunctive treatment. Finally, we tested the hypothesis that topiramate 
plus MET, compared to placebo plus MET, would reduce abstinence rates, as assessed by 
self-reported frequency of use (percent use days) and biochemical verification of abstinence 
(urine toxicology), as well as self-reported quantity of use (average number of grams 
smoked on cannabis use days) of cannabis use among youth.

 Materials and Methods
Study Design
This double-blind study used a randomized, parallel group design to test the feasibility and 
efficacy of topiramate versus placebo for reducing cannabis use in youth. Topiramate was 
titrated to 200 mg daily over four weeks then stabilized for two weeks (see Table 1). 
Participants in both conditions received a three-session manual-driven MET intervention 
designed to enhance motivation and build skills to reduce cannabis use. Procedures were 
identical across conditions except for the medication administered. The Brown University 
Institutional Review Board approved this study, and before participation written informed 
consent was obtained from youths ≥18 years and from the parents of minors; assent was 
obtained from minors.
Participants
Participants were youths, ages 15 to 24 years, recruited from the community (e.g., posting 
advertisements in recreational settings, high schools, and other settings frequented by youth) 
with an interest in receiving a psychosocial intervention combined with a novel medication 
(or placebo) that may help them reduce their cannabis use. Youths who were mandated to 
treatment by the court system or by their parents were ineligible. All participants used 
cannabis use at least twice weekly in the past 30 days and experienced some clinically 
significant problems associated with their cannabis use (i.e., ≥one symptom of cannabis 
abuse or dependence) and 80% of youths met criteria for cannabis abuse or dependence 
(Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-Fourth Edition; DSM-IV-TR; Association (2000). 
Participants were not required to meet diagnostic threshold for a cannabis use disorder 
because DSM-IV-TR criteria do not adequately capture substance use disorders in youth 
(Degenhardt et al., 2002). Exclusion criteria were cannabis treatment in the past 30 days; 
current Axis I psychopathology other than cannabis, alcohol, nicotine, or disruptive behavior 
disorders, as defined by DSM-IV-TR; actively suicidal or psychotic; and medical conditions 
or medications that contraindicated taking topiramate. Females were ineligible if they were 
pregnant, nursing, or unwilling to use birth control. Medical eligibility was assessed by 
completing a comprehensive medical history, physical exam, and laboratory tests.
Diagnostic Assessment and Outcome Measures
Demographic and clinical characteristics—Demographic and clinical information 
was collected at baseline. Although we did not require youths to meet diagnostic criteria for 
a cannabis use disorder to be eligible for the study, we did assess for abuse and dependence 
for descriptive purposes and to ensure medication conditions were similar in terms of the 
severity of cannabis misuse. Psychiatric diagnoses, including cannabis use disorders, were 
derived using the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders for School-Age Children, a semi-
structured interview based on DSM-IV-TR criteria (Kaufman et al., 1997). Interviewers 
received systematic training and achieved a high level of inter-rater reliability (kappa > 
0.90). Diagnostic decisions were based on participants’ reports, made by case consensus, 
and used for randomization (see below) and descriptive purposes. To further describe the 
sample, participants completed the Rutgers Cannabis Problem Index (Johnson and White, 
1995), a continuous measure of cannabis-related problems.

 Cannabis use—Cannabis use prior to the study was assessed using the 90-day timeline 
follow-back interview (TLFB) (Sobell and Sobell, 1992), which correlates highly with 
plasma THC levels (Hjorthoj et al., 2012). Assessment of cannabis use during the trial 
included urinalysis (Redwood Toxicology Reditest®; cutoff = 50ng/mL) and TLFB. To 
facilitate accurate reporting of the quantity of cannabis use on a specific day, participants 
estimated how much cannabis they used by weighing a surrogate substance (oregano). The 
total weight was divided by the number of users when participants shared cannabis. This 
method of estimating daily quantities of cannabis use produces reliable outcome data 
(Norberg et al., 2012).
Adverse events—Included in the consent/assent forms was a list of topiramate’s known 
side effects. The Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Effects interview of side 
effects (Levine and Schooler, 1986) was adapted to assess side effects of topiramate at 
weekly appointments. To ensure expected and unexpected events were reported, side effects 
were collected in an open-ended way first, and then participants were queried about known 
topiramate effects. In addition, given that topiramate can potentiate negative affect, we 
administered the Beck Depression Inventory at baseline and at weekly visits to capture mood 
changes across the trial.
Neurocognitive functioning—Participants completed the Kaufman Brief Intelligence 
Test, Second Edition (KBIT) (Kaufman and Kaufman, 1990) prior to randomization for 
randomization purposes (see below). In addition, a neurocognitive test battery was selected 
to measure domains of functioning shown to be sensitive to topiramate. Eight standardized 
tests comprised this battery. All tests were administered by trained research staff at baseline 
(prior to randomization) and again during study weeks 3 (100 mg/day) and 6 (200 mg/day) 
except for the Story Recall subtest of the Woodcock Johnson® III Tests of Cognitive 
Abilities (WJTCA), which was only completed at baseline and study week 6 due to the 
limited number of available test administrations. Descriptive information for neurocognitive 
tests by medication group and tests of differences by study week is reported online in 
supporting information (Table S1 and S2).
Study Treatments
Randomization to treatment conditions—After completion of baseline assessments, 
participants were randomized to one of two 6-week treatment conditions: topiramate plus 
MET or placebo plus MET. An investigator with no direct participant contact used a 
computer-generated random allocation sequence to assign participants to treatment 
conditions on a 2:1 (topiramate to placebo) ratio. A randomized block design, with block 
sizes of 8 participants, stratified participants by sex, cannabis dependence, and baseline 
working memory function to ensure treatment conditions were balanced on these variables. 
We stratified by working memory using a cutoff score of 18 on the Memory for Words 
subtest of the WJTCA due to topiramate’s known adverse cognitive effects. The imbalanced 
randomization schedule ensured that sufficient numbers of participants in the topiramate 
condition reached the target dose given the anticipated attrition rate (Johnson et al., 2007).

 MET—Three 50-min manual-driven MET sessions were individually administered across 
both medication conditions during study weeks 1, 3, and 5 of the intervention period. The 
MET protocol was based on prior work (Walker et al., 2006) and incorporated the principles 
of MI (Miller and Rollnick, 2002). The first session focused on enhancing motivation to 
reduce or quit cannabis use by establishing rapport, assessing motivation for change, and 
discussion of perceived pros and cons of cannabis use. During the second session, 
participants received a personalized cannabis use feedback packet, which was reviewed in 
the context of an MI-style discussion about the content. During the third session, the 
counselor reviewed the prior sessions, facilitated a discussion about progress toward goals 
set during the trial, queried about barriers to change, and helped problem solve and set new 
goals for behavior change.
Two masters- and three doctoral-level counselors provided MET across both medication 
conditions to ensure that differences between conditions were not confounded with 
counselor personality, experience, or individual style. All counselors reviewed the MET 
manual, completed at least 20 hours of training in MET, and conducted a minimum of two 
mock cases. The same counselor conducted all 3 sessions in order to enhance rapport, 
provide continuity of care, and minimize attrition. Counselors were blind to participants’ 
medication condition and did not conduct any research assessments with participants. All 
sessions were audio taped and rated by trained clinicians with respect to intervention 
integrity/adherence using Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) scale 
(Moyers et al., 2007). Five domains were rated for each session (evocation, collaboration, 
autonomy/support, direction, and empathy) using a 5-point scale (1 = low, 5 = high) then 
averaged across sessions to yield an overall score for each dimension.
Pharmacological treatment with topiramate—Participants and study personnel in 
direct contact with participants were blind to treatment assignments. An independent 
compounding pharmacy provided topiramate and placebo capsules, which were identical in 
appearance. Capsules were prepackaged in 7-day blister packaging cards consecutively 
numbered according to a computer-generated randomization schedule to ensure the 
researchers who enrolled and assessed participants were blind to treatment assignments. 
Participants were given one morning and one evening dose. We did not provide participants 
with the option to reduce or delay the maximum dosage.
Topiramate capsules contained appropriate unit dosages of the active study medication (see 
Table 1) and placebo capsules contained pharmacologically inert filler. All capsules also 
contained 50mg of riboflavin to assess medication compliance in both treatment conditions; 
riboflavin concentrations in urine were assessed at weekly visits. Two raters, blind to 
randomization, independently evaluated urine samples under ultraviolet light to determine 
the presence or absence of riboflavin (Del Boca et al., 1996). A third rater resolved 
discrepancies. Participants also provided blood samples at study weeks 3 and 6 for 
topiramate quantification in serum, which was dichotomized as present or absent for 
compliance purposes.

 Data Analysis
Pretreatment differences between conditions were evaluated using independent sample t-
tests and chi-squared analyses conducted in SPSS 22.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY). Comparisons 
between conditions on MET treatment attendance and adherence were examined using 
independent sample t-tests. Chi-squared analyses compared the frequency of reported side 
effects between treatment conditions. Changes in performance on neuropsychological tests 
from baseline to study weeks 3 and 6 were analyzed using generalized estimating equations 
(GEE), which allows for varying numbers of observations per participant while controlling 
for autocorrelation (Zeger et al., 1988). An independent structure best fit the data and all 
models assumed a normal link function. To test for changes relative to baseline, study weeks 
were coded as binary variables and the baseline assessment served as a reference category 
(Table S2).
Multiple-domain latent growth modeling (MDLGM) in Mplus 7.0 (Muthén and Muthén, 
1998-2013) was used to simultaneously estimate the influence of topiramate on change in 
urine toxicology (binary outcome), percent use days, and grams per use day (continuous 
outcomes) over the course of the 6-week trial. MDLGM is increasingly recognized as a 
useful modeling approach for intervention studies because of its flexibility to model change 
in multiple treatment outcomes and also mixed response types (Whittaker, Pituch, & 
McDougall, 2014). Additionally, MDLGM increases power to test the influence of 
explanatory variables on outcomes by reducing the standard error associated with these tests, 
which is particularly useful when missing outcome data are likely (Whittaker et al., 2014). 
Data were analyzed in two ways. First, all available data were included in “intent-to-treat” 
analyses. Next, data for missing outcomes were imputed by averaging over 10 datasets with 
Bayesian estimation using baseline variables as missing-data correlates to improve the 
estimates (see Table 2 for descriptors). Both sets of analyses utilized full information 
maximum likelihood estimation procedures with numerical integration.
Linear growth (slope) parameters were coded from 0 to 1 (i.e., 0, .2, .4, .6, .8, 1, see 
Supporting Information, Figure S1) to allow the intercept to be interpreted as week-1 
outcome levels, which were not expected to differ between medication conditions, and the 
slope to be interpreted as the change in outcomes from week 1 to week 6. Initial, 
unconditional MDLGMs provided average intercept and slope parameters for all outcomes. 
Next, intercepts and slopes were regressed on Medication Condition to test whether 
topiramate influenced week 1 outcomes (intercept) or change in outcomes from week 1 to 
week 6 (slope). Final models included baseline levels of outcomes assessed via TLFB, age, 
and cannabis dependence as covariates.
Results
Randomization, Pretreatment Comparison of Conditions, and Completion Rates
Sixty-six participants were randomized (see Figure 1). The majority met criteria for cannabis 
abuse or dependence, with similar rates of these disorders in the topiramate (abuse = 22.5%; 
dependence = 62.5%) and placebo-control (abuse = 19%; dependence = 76.9%) conditions. 
As shown in Table 2, treatment groups did not differ significantly on pretreatment clinical

 characteristics, pretreatment study outcome variables, and other demographic characteristics 
except for age. The topiramate group was older, on average, relative to the placebo group, 
Mdifference = −1.49, 95%CI = [−2.52, −0.46], p = .005.
Of the 66 participants, 39 youth (59.1%) completed the trial. As expected, attrition occurred 
disproportionally in the topiramate condition (52.5%) compared to the placebo condition 
(23.1%), χ2 = 5.64, df = 1, p = .018. Participants assigned to placebo completed a mean of 
34.77 days (SD = 12.50), whereas those assigned to topiramate completed a mean of 28.26 
days (SD = 13.96); Mdifference = 6.51, p = .057, 95%CI [−0.92, 12.91]. Table 2 presents 
descriptive characteristics of the full sample, completers, and those participants who 
withdrew, stratified by medication group. No differences were found between medication 
groups within completers or within those who withdrew (see Table 2).
Due to their higher attrition, participants randomized to topiramate attended fewer sessions 
of MET (M = 2.00, SD = 1.07) than those randomized to placebo (M = 2.65, SD = 0.75; p 
= .004). Ninety percent of participants randomized to topiramate completed Session 1, 60% 
completed Session 2, and 47.5% completed Session 3. By comparison, 100% of the placebo 
group completed Session 1, 84.6% completed Session 2, and 80.8% completed Session 3. 
Comparisons between treatment conditions on MET fidelity revealed no differences between 
conditions on any of the five domains of MITI scales.
Medication Compliance and Tolerability
Weekly urine samples indicated a high rate of adherence in both conditions throughout the 
trial. Participants randomized to placebo were compliant on an average of 89.7% (SD = 
18.9) of their urine assays compared to 93.4% (SD = 18.4) in the topiramate condition (p = .
44). Among participants randomized to topiramate, comparisons between urine assays under 
ultraviolet light and serum topiramate quantification showed 86.4% concordance (kappa = 
0.40) between the two measures at study weeks 3 and 6.
Of those participants who withdrew from the topiramate condition, 67% attributed their 
withdrawal to adverse medication side effects. Table 3 summarizes side effects reported by 
≥10% of participants in either condition at any time during the study. Although no serious 
adverse events occurred in this trial, participants randomized to topiramate were 
significantly more likely to report depression, anxiety, difficulty with coordination or 
balance, weight loss, and paresthesias. Participants randomized to placebo were more likely 
to report rash. Otherwise, there were no statistically significant differences between 
conditions.
We also examined the effects of topiramate on depressive symptoms as measured by the 
BDI. Medication conditions scored similarly on the BDI at baseline (β = −0.06, 95%CI 
[−0.56, 0.45], p = .827), and the main effect of medication condition on BDI scores across 
the trial was not significant (β = 0.10, 95%CI [−0.34, 0.53], p = .666). The main effect of 
study week was significant, however, such that overall participants reported lower levels of 
depressive symptoms across the trial (β = −0.47, 95%CI [−0.76, 0.18], p = .001). 
Examination of the effects of medication condition on BDI scores at each study week with 
baseline BDI scores coded as the reference category indicated that the topiramate group, as

 compared to the placebo-control, had significantly less attenuation of BDI scores from 
baseline in study week 6 (β = 0.66, 95%CI [0.10, 1.23], p = .022). No other differences were 
found.
Neurocognitive Test Performance
Medication conditions were equivalent at baseline on neurocognitive tests. Table S1 shows 
descriptive statistics for the effects of topiramate on neurocognitive function across the trial. 
Youths randomized to topiramate, as compared to placebo, showed decreased performance 
on retrieval fluency from baseline at study weeks 3 and 6 and decreased memory for words 
at week 6 (see Table S2). As shown in Table S2, no other differences between the 
medication conditions emerged in terms of neurocognitive test performance.
Cannabis Use Outcomes
Results using all available data (intent-to-treat analyses) were consistent with those based on 
imputation analyses. Statistics reported in text are based on imputed data for both 
unconditional and conditional MDLGMs. Results of tests for medication effects based on all 
available data are provided in Table 4. Standardized effect estimates for the conditional 
MDLGM with imputed data are included in Figure S1. Raw data and standard errors for 
grams per use day are shown in Figure 2, Panel A. Raw data and standard errors for percent 
use days and proportion negative urine toxicology outcomes are shown in Figure 2, Panel B, 
on the left and right y axes, respectively.
Unconditional MDLGM—An initial, unconditional MDLGM estimated general trends, 
i.e., average week 1 outcomes (intercepts) and average change in outcomes from week 1 to 
week 6 (slopes). On the whole, youth used cannabis on 68.4% of days in week 1, Mintercept = 
0.68, 95%CI [0.61, 0.58], p < .001, and the average growth rate for percent use days 
decreased over the course of the study, Mslope = −0.18, 95%CI [−0.27, −0.08], p < .001. 
Results of urine analysis also showed that the probability of positive urine screens decreased 
over time, Mslope = −1.82, 95%CI [−3.13. −0.51], p = .006. In terms of the quantity, 
participants used 0.51 grams of cannabis on use days, on average, during week 1, Mintercept 
= 0.51, 95%CI [0.40, 0.61], p < .001. On average, youths’ quantity of cannabis use (grams 
per use day) did not change significantly over the course of the study, Mslope = −0.02, 
95%CI [−0.12, 0.07], p = .638.
Conditional MDLGM—Results of conditional tests of medication condition on week 1 
outcomes (intercepts) and change over time (slopes) are shown in Table 4 for both imputed 
data and all available data. Percent use days. The effect of Medication Condition on the 
percent-use-days intercept was not significant, suggesting that the frequency of cannabis use 
did not differ between medication groups at week 1, b = −0.01, 95%CI [−0.16, −0.13], p = .
849. The slope effect was also not significant, suggesting that medication treatment did not 
significantly affect change in percent use days from weeks 1 to 6 beyond average trends for 
this sample, b = −0.10, 95%CI [−0.27, −0.07], p = .238. Urine toxicology. Consistent with 
findings based on self-report, medication did not significantly influence the probability of 
positive urine screens at week 1, b = −1.26, 95%CI [−3.81, −1.30], p = .335, or produce 
change in positive urine screens from week 1 to week 6, b = −0.42, 95%CI [−2.96, −2.12], p

 = .746. Grams per use day. The effect of Medication Condition on the grams-per-use-day 
intercept was not significant, b = −0.14, 95%CI [−0.35, −0.08], p = .213, suggesting that the 
quantity of cannabis use did not differ between medication groups at week 1. However, a 
trend emerged for the effect of medication condition on grams-per-use-day slope, suggesting 
that youth in the topiramate group smoked fewer grams of cannabis when they used during 
the final week of the trial (week 6), relative to the placebo group, b = −0.17, 95%CI [−0.35, 
0.00], p = .052. The effect size (r) was equivalent to the standardized estimate, β = − 0.36, 
95%CI [−.73, 0.02], p = .066. The effect was strengthened when accounting for age, 
cannabis dependence, and use prior to the trial, b = −0.26, 95%CI [−0.43, −0.09], p = .003.
Discussion
This study is the first to examine the feasibility and efficacy of topiramate as an adjunctive 
therapy for treating cannabis misuse. Adolescents and young adults in both conditions 
smoked less frequently as the trial progressed, but there was no advantage of adjunctive 
topiramate treatment on this effect. However, topiramate, as compared to placebo, produced 
modest reductions in how much cannabis participants smoked on use days. Topiramate was 
not well tolerated, however, and the clinical significance of this reduction is uncertain.
Only 48% of youths randomized to topiramate completed the 6-week trial, compared to 77% 
of youths in the placebo condition. Of those who withdrew from topiramate, 67% attributed 
their withdrawal to adverse medication side effects. We also examined the effects of 
topiramate on several domains of neurocognitive functioning, given its known adverse 
cognitive effects. Results of neurocognitive testing showed that topiramate compromised 
retrieval fluency and the ability to form and verbalize echoic memories. In addition, self-
report data showed significantly higher rates of neurocognitive adverse events associated 
with topiramate relative to placebo, including difficulty with concentration and attention, 
dizziness, depression, anxiety, difficulty with coordination or balance, confusion, and 
approximately twice the rate of slow thinking or reactions. It is difficult to compare these 
findings with other research given differences across studies in terms of the characteristics of 
patients who are typically prescribed topiramate (e.g., epilepsy) and the doses administered. 
Even so, our findings converge with research on adolescents prescribed topiramate for 
treating migraines (Pandina et al., 2010) or seizures and with an adult study that tested the 
effects of topiramate (300 mg/day) for treating alcohol misuse (Knapp et al., 2015).
Our finding that topiramate reduced the quantity but not the frequency of cannabis use may 
have several explanations. First, it is possible that topiramate alters subjective effects of 
cannabis use, thereby reducing how much additional cannabis individuals use on a given 
day. This notion is consistent with theoretical models and recent findings regarding how 
topiramate affects other drugs of abuse (Johnson et al., 2003; Miranda, In Press). Using 
addictive substances, including cannabis, produces a host of pharmacological effects that 
cause acute changes in affect and cognition. These subjective experiences, which are central 
in nearly all contemporary models of addiction, predict future use and are important targets 
for clinical interventions. Second, the behavioral platform for testing medication effects 
targeted harm reduction as the primary treatment goal. It is possible that topiramate 
enhanced the efficacy of this intervention approach. Finally, we tested whether topiramate

 affected cannabis use beyond the influence of an established psychosocial intervention. 
Although adjunctive topiramate treatment did not reduce the frequency of cannabis use, we 
found that across conditions participants significantly reduced how often they smoked. It is 
plausible that the behavioral intervention increased abstinence rates while topiramate 
reduced how much cannabis youth smoked on days they used. This possibility remains 
speculative, however, and cannot be determined based on our current study. Future research 
is needed to understand the ideal ways to combine pharmacological and psychosocial 
therapies.
Findings of this initial study should be considered in the context of its limitations. First, this 
pilot study had a small sample size and the duration of treatment was short, especially in 
terms of the length of topiramate treatment at the target dose (two weeks). As such, our 
findings are preliminary. Second, participants randomized to topiramate attended 
significantly fewer MET sessions than those in the placebo condition because of their higher 
attrition rates. Concerns about differential exposure to the behavioral intervention are 
somewhat mitigated, however, by the fact that effects of topiramate on cannabis use were 
observed. Third, participants were 15 to 24 years old and youths randomized to topiramate 
were older than those randomized to placebo. It is possible that developmental changes that 
occur across this age span (e.g., living arrangement, work/school changes, parental 
monitoring) influence how youths responded to treatment. This concern is somewhat 
lessened by the fact that our findings were upheld when age was statistically controlled. 
Nonetheless, larger studies are needed to adequately examine whether adolescents and 
young adults respond differently to combined interventions.
On balance, our study design tested the effects of topiramate on cannabis use in the context 
of an active behavioral treatment that served as a psychosocial intervention platform 
administered across both medication conditions. Advantages of this approach include the 
ability to evaluate whether topiramate is superior to an effective treatment that presents less 
potential risk. It also maximizes a favorable risk-benefit ratio for participants by delivering 
an active intervention to youths randomized to placebo. Importantly, the behavioral 
intervention was delivered in the same offices by the same counselors and overseen by the 
same expert supervisors in both conditions. MET adherence ratings indicated that counselors 
adhered to MI treatment strategies similarly across both medication conditions. Thus, our 
findings are not likely attributable to a weak control condition. In addition, objective 
measures indicated that participants were highly compliant with the medication regimen. 
Finally, the MDLGM approach for analyzing our outcomes allowed for a comprehensive 
evaluation of the impact of topiramate with the inclusion of multiple growth processes. 
Advantages of this method include better treatment of missing data, increased statistical 
power, and improved Type I error protection (Whittaker et al., 2014).
In this pilot study, we intervened with youths during a critical period in the development of 
cannabis dependence; early intervention can alter trajectories of continued substance misuse 
in adulthood. The potential significance of our findings is mitigated, however, by the small 
sample size and high attrition rates in the topiramate condition. On the whole, these 
preliminary findings which suggest a small reduction of cannabis use by a poorly tolerated 
medication – indicate limited promise of topiramate for treating cannabis misuse in youths.
