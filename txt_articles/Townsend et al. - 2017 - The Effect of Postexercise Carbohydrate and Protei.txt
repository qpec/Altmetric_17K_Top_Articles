Abstract  
22 
Purpose 
23 
To investigate the effect of feeding carbohydrate and protein (CHO+PRO), immediately or 2 
24 
h after an exhaustive run, on the bone turnover response in endurance runners.  
25 
Methods 
26 
10 men (age 28±5 y, height 1.74±0.05 m, body mass 69.7±6.3 kg) performed treadmill 
27 
running at 75%VO2max, until exhaustion, on three occasions. Blood was collected before and 
28 
immediately, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 24 h post-exercise, for measurement of β-CTX, P1NP, PTH, PO4, 
29 
ACa and Ca2+. This was a randomised, counterbalanced, placebo-controlled, single-blinded, 
30 
cross-over study. The three trials were; i) placebo (PLA),  PLA solution was ingested 
31 
immediately and 2 h post-exercise, ii) immediate feeding (IF), CHO+PRO (1.5 g.kgBM-1 
32 
dextrose and 0.5 g.kgBM-1 whey) were ingested immediately post-exercise and PLA 2 h post-
33 
exercise, and iii) delayed feeding (DF), PLA was ingested immediately post-exercise and 
34 
CHO+PRO solution 2 h post-exercise. Data were analysed using repeated measures ANOVA 
35 
and post-hoc Tukey’s HSD.  
36 
Results 
37 
At 1 and 2 h post-exercise, β-CTX concentrations were lower in the IF trial than the DF and 
38 
PLA trials (P≤0.001). At 3 h post-exercise, β-CTX concentrations were higher in the PLA 
39 
trial than the IF (P≤0.001) and DF trials (P=0.026). At 4 h post-exercise, β-CTX 
40 
concentrations were lower in the DF trial than the IF (P=0.003) and PLA trials (P≤0.001). At 
41 
4 h post-exercise, P1NP was higher in the IF trial than in DF (P=0.026) and PLA trials 
42 
(P=0.001). At 3 h post-exercise, PTH was higher in the IF trial than the DF trial (P≤0.001).  
43 
Conclusions 
44 
Following exhaustive running, immediate ingestion of CHO+PRO may be beneficial, as it 
45 
decreases bone resorption marker concentrations and increases bone formation marker 
46 
concentrations; creating a more positive bone turnover balance.

Introduction 
50 
Dietary practices can influence both acute bone turnover and long-term bone health (38) and 
51 
feeding influences the diurnal rhythm of bone turnover markers at rest (31). Feeding of a 
52 
mixed nutrient meal suppresses all markers of bone turnover (4) and feeding of individual 
53 
nutrients; glucose, fat, protein and calcium, also suppresses bone resorption at rest (2, 3, 5, 
54 
14). However, previous studies have only investigated the response in resting, non-athletic 
55 
participants, who have not performed any prior exercise; it is therefore not known whether 
56 
there is a similar suppressive effect of nutrient ingestion on bone resorption, after exercise in 
57 
athletic individuals.  
58 
 
59 
Prolonged and intense exercise causes increased bone resorption, as shown by increases in C-
60 
terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (β-CTX) (19, 22, 33), although markers of bone 
61 
formation, such as N-terminal propeptides of type 1 procollagen (P1NP), are less responsive 
62 
to acute bouts of exercise (13, 32, 34). Increases in bone resorption, without concomitant 
63 
increases in bone formation, have been observed for up to four days after a bout of exhaustive 
64 
running (32). Although not definitive, this suggests that prolonged and intense exercise could 
65 
lead to an uncoupling or imbalance in bone turnover, favouring increased bone resorption, 
66 
which may have detrimental effects on bone mass and health (15). This uncoupling has been 
67 
implicated in the formation of stress fracture injuries (30, 39), which are debilitating injuries 
68 
for athletes and on average result in 169 days (with a range of 90 to 270 days) of lost training 
69 
(23, 27). Therefore maintaining coupled bone turnover and anabolic conditions for bone 
70 
during and after exercise is important for athletes. Given that endurance athletes train 
71 
multiple times a day preventing bone loss and stress fracture injury will help maximise 
72 
available training time.   
73 
 
74 
 4 
 
Pre-exercise feeding has been investigated as a potential means for attenuating the bone 
75 
resorption response to exercise. Scott et al. (34) showed that feeding a mixed nutrient 
76 
breakfast prior to exercise had no effect on post-exercise β-CTX concentrations compared to 
77 
fasting and there were no changes in markers of bone formation. This implies that the 
78 
mechanical loading experienced during exercise over-rides any responses caused by pre-
79 
exercise feeding. Scott et al. (34) also suggested that the stimulatory effect of PTH on β-CTX 
80 
may override the effect of pre-exercise feeding, therefore other exercise feeding practices, the 
81 
subsequent PTH response and related metabolites (calcium and phosphate) require 
82 
investigation.  
83 
 
84 
Sale et al. (29) showed that carbohydrate (CHO) feeding during exercise attenuated the β-
85 
CTX and P1NP responses in the hours following exercise, indicating an acute effect of CHO 
86 
feeding on bone turnover; however, feeding during intense running is not always well 
87 
tolerated and is limited by time and practicality. Post-exercise feeding provides a practical 
88 
opportunity to feed multiple nutrients and in the correct amounts, thus allowing athletes to 
89 
reach other sports nutrition goals, such as aiding muscle glycogen resynthesis, protein 
90 
synthesis and maintaining adequate hydration status (16, 36), without the restrictions of 
91 
gastrointestinal discomfort, which commonly limits nutrient ingestion during exercise. Post-
92 
exercise feeding also allows for investigation of the bone turnover response to acute feeding 
93 
without the confounding effect of mechanical loading. It is not known whether the acute bone 
94 
turnover response to post-exercise feeding is the same as at rest and whether this varies with 
95 
different timings of post-exercise nutrient ingestion. The aim of this study was to investigate 
96 
the effect of feeding carbohydrate and protein (CHO+PRO) immediately or 2 h after a 
97 
prolonged intense running bout, on the bone turnover response in trained endurance runners. 
98 
 5 
 
Markers associated with exercise and bone were also measured to explore possible mediating 
99 
and mechanistic factors.

Methods 
101 
Participants  
102 
10 men ([mean ± 1SD] age 28 ± 6 y, height 1.74 ± 0.05 m, body mass 69.7 ± 6.3 kg, VO2max 
103 
63.0 ± 5.0 mL.kgBM-1.min-1, weekly running distance 49.9 ± 12.5 km) completed this study 
104 
that was approved by Nottingham Trent University’s Ethical Advisory Committee. All 
105 
participants were trained endurance runners who had been competing and training 
106 
consistently for a minimum of 2 years in 10 km, half marathon, marathon or ultra-distance 
107 
races, without a significant break. Participants had recorded at least one of the following 
108 
times in the past 2 years; ≤35 minutes for 10 km, ≤1:25:00 for half marathon or ≤3:00:00 for 
109 
marathon. Participants were recruited from local running and triathlon clubs and local races, 
110 
via posters, flyers and posts on club websites. Consent was obtained by the primary 
111 
researcher. Participants were non-smokers, had not suffered a fracture in the last 12 months, 
112 
were free from musculoskeletal injury and did not suffer from any condition known to affect 
113 
bone metabolism. Compliance with these inclusion criteria was confirmed in the initial visit 
114 
to the laboratory where health screening was completed and written informed consent was 
115 
provided.  
116 
 
117 
Experimental Design  
118 
This was a randomised (Latin Square Design), counterbalanced, placebo-controlled and 
119 
single-blinded, crossover study. Participants completed a preliminary visit for habituation 
120 
with trial procedures and measurement of VO2max. Participants then completed three, four-day 
121 
experimental trials, each separated by 1 week. On days 1 and 2, participants refrained from 
122 
all exercise and followed a prescribed diet. On day 3, participants performed a bout of 
123 
treadmill running, at a speed equal to 75% of their previously determined VO2max, until 
124 
volitional exhaustion. Blood samples (20 mL) were collected before exercise, immediately 
125 
 7 
 
after exercise and every hour after exercise for four hours. On day 4, participants returned to 
126 
the laboratory for a fasted follow up blood sample. The three trials consisted of; i) a placebo 
127 
(PLA) control trial, where the PLA solution was ingested both immediately and 2 h post-
128 
exercise, ii) an immediate feeding (IF) trial, where the CHO+PRO solution was ingested 
129 
immediately post-exercise and the PLA solution 2 h post-exercise, and iii) a delayed feeding 
130 
(DF) trial where the PLA solution was ingested immediately post-exercise and the 
131 
CHO+PRO solution 2 h post-exercise. In the PLA trial, the CHO+PRO solution was ingested 
132 
after the final blood sample to ensure that the energy content and the composition of the diet 
133 
was identical between trials. This meant that a final PLA solution also needed to be ingested 
134 
in the IF and DF trials to ensure participant blinding to the trial conditions (Figure 1).  
135 
 
 
136 
Assessment of VO2max  
137 
Participants performed an incremental treadmill test to determine lactate threshold, as per 
138 
Jones and Doust (17), followed by a ramp test to determine VO2max. Level running velocities 
139 
corresponding to 75%VO2max (13.0 ± 0.8 km.h-1) were calculated based on the regression of 
140 
VO2 and velocity.  
141 
 
142 
Experimental Dietary Provision 
143 
Participants completed a three-day food diary for the measurement of habitual energy intake 
144 
and macronutrient composition. A diet consisting of 55% CHO, 30% fat and 15% PRO, and 
145 
isocaloric with habitual diets was designed using dietary analysis software (Nutritics, Dublin, 
146 
Ireland), for each participant to consume on days 1 and 2 of each trial. Participants provided 
147 
their own food but were given written and verbal instructions for the preparation of meals, 
148 
including timings of meals and snacks. Any deviations from prescribed diets were confirmed 
149 
verbally on day 3 and recorded; there were no significant deviations from prescribed diets.  
150

151 
Experimental Trial Procedure 
152 
Participants were asked to maintain their habitual training and record this throughout the 
153 
study to help maintain consistency across trials. Participants refrained from all exercise on 
154 
days 1 and 2. Participants arrived at the laboratory on day 3, after fasting from 20:00 the 
155 
previous evening and consuming 500 mL of water upon awakening. Shortly after arriving, 
156 
body mass was measured and the first 20 mL blood sample was taken via venepuncture after 
157 
10 minutes of semi-recumbent rest.  
158 
 
159 
Participants then ran to volitional exhaustion at 75%VO2max, which was preceded by a 5-
160 
minute warm-up and volitional stretching. At exhaustion a cannula was inserted into a 
161 
prominent forearm vein, which was kept patent by flushing with saline, a second 20 mL 
162 
blood sample was taken, with further blood samples taken at 1, 2, 3 and 4 h into recovery. 
163 
Exact times of exercise commencement, time to exhaustion and blood samples were recorded 
164 
and were repeated exactly in each trial within-participants to reduce the impact of circadian 
165 
variation on the results. Due to differences in individual run times to exhaustion between 
166 
participants, post-exercise blood sample timings vary between participants, but were 
167 
controlled for within-participants. The baseline blood sample was taken at 08:40 and exercise 
168 
commenced at 08:50, the blood sample at exhaustion was taken at 10:10 ± 13 min and blood 
169 
samples 1 – 4 hours post-exercise were taken at 11:10 ± 13 min, 12:10 ± 13 min, 13:10 ± 13 
170 
min and 14:10 ± 13 min.  
171 
 
172 
Depending on the trial, participants were given either the CHO+PRO or PLA solution to 
173 
consume immediately after exhaustion. Two and four hours after exhaustion participants 
174 
were given further solutions to consume. After the final solution was consumed, participants 
175 
 9 
 
were provided with food and were free to leave the laboratory. Participants consumed a snack 
176 
at 15:00 and an evening meal at 18:00 and then remained fasted from 20:00 until the next 
177 
morning. On day 4 participants arrived in the laboratory after consuming 500 mL of water 
178 
upon awakening and a final 20 mL blood sample was taken. 
179 
 
180 
Recovery Solutions and Evening Meal Composition 
181 
The CHO+PRO solution contained 1.5 g.kgBM-1 of CHO (dextrose) and 0.5 g.kgBM-1 of 
182 
PRO (unflavoured whey isolate) that was made up to a 12.5% CHO solution with water. The 
183 
whey isolate and dextrose mix was tested for banned substances by LGC Supplement 
184 
Screening (Cambridgeshire, UK; UKAS Testing Laboratory 1187; Certificate of Analysis 
185 
91530). Preliminary testing ensured that the PLA solution was taste matched to the 
186 
CHO+PRO solution using artificial sweetener and flavouring; it consisted of 12 mL.kgBM-1 
187 
of water, making this the same volume as the CHO+PRO solution. Participants were blinded 
188 
to the solutions that they were consuming throughout trials. The total volume of fluid 
189 
consumed in the three recovery solutions was 2,509 ± 227 mL.  
190 
 
191 
On day 3 the overall diet composition was 2,000 kcal, 55% CHO, 30% fat and 15% PRO. 
192 
The recovery solution contained approximately 500 kcal depending on individual body mass, 
193 
therefore the snack and evening meal contained approximately 1,500 kcal. Deviations from 
194 
prescribed diets were confirmed verbally on day 4 and recorded; there were no significant 
195 
deviations from prescribed diets. Participants were allowed to ingest plain water on an ad 
196 
libitum basis throughout the recovery periods, although none of the participants did this 
197 
during any of the trials.  
198 
  
199 
Treatment and Storage of Blood Samples 
200 
 10 
 
Blood was transferred into precooled tubes and gently inverted 5–8 times; 15 mL of blood 
201 
was transferred into tubes containing 15%, 0.12 mL of K3E EDTA (Becton Dickinson 
202 
Vacutainer System, USA) and then centrifuged immediately at 3000 rev.min-1, for 10 minutes 
203 
at 5°C, generating plasma. The remaining 5 mL of blood was transferred into standard serum 
204 
tubes (Becton Dickinson Vacutainer System, USA), left to clot at room temperature for 60 
205 
min before being centrifuged at 2000 rev.min-1, for 10 minutes at 5°C. Plasma and serum was 
206 
subsequently stored at -80°C until analysis.  
207 
 
208 
Biochemical Analysis 
209 
β-CTX, P1NP and parathyroid hormone (PTH) were measured by electro-chemiluminescence 
210 
immunoassay on an fully automated COBAS c501 system (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, 
211 
Germany) in blood plasma and were measured in singlicate. The inter-assay CV for β-CTX 
212 
was ≤3% between 0.2 and 1.5 µg.L-1, with sensitivity of 0.01 µg.L-1. The inter-assay CV for 
213 
P1NP was ≤3% between 20 and 600 µg.L-1, with sensitivity of 8 µg.L-1. The inter-assay CV 
214 
for PTH was ≤4% between 1 and 30 pmol.L-1, with sensitivity of 0.8 pmol.L-1. Phosphate 
215 
(PO4), total calcium (Ca) and albumin were measured in serum, using standard colorimetric 
216 
assays and spectrophotometric methods, performed on an ABX Pentra 400 (Horiba ABX, 
217 
Montpellier, France). PO4 was measured using phosphomolybdate, with an inter- and intra-
218 
assay CV of ≤3.6% between 0.09 and 7.80 mmol.L-1. Total Ca was measured using ortho-
219 
cresolphtalein complexone, with an inter- and intra-assay CV of ≤1.7% between 0.04 and 
220 
5.00 mmol.L-1. Albumin was measured using bromocresol green, with an inter- and intra-
221 
assay CV of ≤1.9% between 0.02 and 5.99 g.dL-1. Because fluctuations in protein, 
222 
particularly albumin, may cause total Ca levels to change independently of the ionised 
223 
calcium (Ca2+) concentration, total Ca concentrations were corrected to give an albumin-
224 
adjusted Ca (ACa) value: 0.8 mg.dL-1 was subtracted from the total Ca concentration for 
225 
 11 
 
every 1.0 g.dL-1 by which the serum albumin concentration was greater than 4 g.dL-1 or 0.8 
226 
mg.dL-1 was added to the total Ca concentration for every 1.0 mg.dL-1 by which the serum 
227 
albumin concentration was less than 4 mg.dL-1. I.e. (([Albumin] − 4) ∗ −0.8) + [Total Ca]. 
228 
Ca2+, glucose and lactate were measured in whole blood using a blood gas analyser 
229 
(Radiometer ABL90 FLEX, Copenhagen, Denmark). Ca2+ is estimated directly between pH 
230 
7.2 and 7.6 with no pH correction applied. The inter- and intra-assay CV for Ca2+ was ≤3% 
231 
between 0.2 and 9.99 mmol.L-1, for glucose was ≤5% between 0 and 60 mmol.L-1 and for 
232 
lactate was ≤26.7% between 0.1 and 31 mmol.L-1. 
233 
 
234 
Statistical Analysis  
235 
The study sample size was calculated to detect changes in β-CTX from pre- to post-
236 
exhaustive exercise, with 85% power at an alpha level of P≤0.05, based on the study by Scott 
237 
et al. (32). Statistical significance was accepted at an alpha level of P≤0.05. All statistical 
238 
analyses were performed on raw data. Baseline concentrations were compared using a one-
239 
way ANOVA. Parametric assumptions of normality and sphericity were confirmed using the 
240 
Shapiro-Wilks test and Maulchy’s test of Sphericity and where assumptions were violated, a 
241 
transformation was applied to the data so that the assumptions were satisfied. Normality and 
242 
homogeneity were achieved following log transformations for ACa and PO4 data. All data 
243 
were subsequently analysed using a repeated measures ANOVA, with Trial (PLA vs IF vs 
244 
DF) and Time (of sampling) as within participant factors. Tukey’s HSD post-hoc test was 
245 
used to compare each time point against baseline and to compare trials at each time point. 
246 
Effect size for multiple comparisons was calculated using partial (𝜂𝑝
2) eta-squared (21). Post-
247 
hoc comparisons are reported with Cohen’s d effect sizes, with d=0.2 considered as a small 
248 
effect, d=0.5 considered as a medium effect and d=0.8 considered as a large effect (6). These 
249 
 12 
 
statistical analyses were performed with Statistica (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK) and SPSS (IBM 
250 
SPSS Statistics 22, Armonk, NY).

Results 
252 
Exercise variables 
253 
The average time to exhaustion (exercise duration) was 01:15:00 ± 00:13:00. There was a 
254 
significant decrease in body mass from pre-exercise (69.4 ± 6.1 kg) to post-exercise (68.9 ± 
255 
5.9 kg) (P=0.001).  
256 
 
257 
Baseline biochemistry 
258 
Baseline concentrations of β-CTX, P1NP, PTH, ACa, Ca2+, PO4 and albumin were not 
259 
significantly different between trials (Table 1).  
260 
 
261 
Habitual diet and experimental dietary provision  
262 
There were no significant differences between the diets prescribed for days 1 and 2 of each 
263 
trial and the diets that were actually consumed by participants, for overall energy content or 
264 
macronutrient composition. Participants’ habitual diets were not different from the diet 
265 
provided on day 3 of trials, for overall energy content, CHO content, fat content and calcium 
266 
content (P=0.101 to 0.523). However, PRO content was significantly higher in the habitual 
267 
diets compared to the experimental trial diet (P=0.049) (Table 2). 
268 
 
269 
Bone turnover markers  
270 
C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (β-CTX) 
271 
There was a significant main effect of Trial (P≤0.001; 𝜂𝑝
2 = 0.581) Time (P≤0.001; 𝜂𝑝
2 =
272 
0.744) and a significant Trial x Time interaction (P≤0.001; 𝜂𝑝
2 = 0.630) for β-CTX. β-CTX 
273 
concentrations were increased from baseline by the end of exercise in all trials (+8 to +12%). 
274 
In the PLA trial, β-CTX concentrations remained increased above baseline at 1 h post-
275 
exercise (+7%), before decreasing thereafter, being significantly lower than baseline 
276 
 14 
 
concentrations 3 and 4 h post-exercise (-31 to -42%; P≤0.001) and 24 h later (-3%). In the IF 
277 
trial, β-CTX concentrations were significantly lower than baseline at 1 h post-exercise and 
278 
remained below baseline until the end of the trial (-22 to -61%; P≤0.01). In the IF trial, β-
279 
CTX concentrations were increased above baseline 24 h later (+8%). In the DF trial, β-CTX 
280 
concentrations were increased above baseline at 1 h post-exercise (+15%), then began to 
281 
decrease and were significantly lower than baseline concentrations 3 and 4 h post-exercise (-
282 
44 to -65%; P≤0.001). In the DF trial, β-CTX concentrations were increased above baseline 
283 
24 h later (+8%) (Figure 2A).  
284 
 
285 
At 1 and 2 h post-exercise, β-CTX concentrations were significantly lower in the IF trial than 
286 
the DF (P≤0.001, d=0.76) and PLA trials (P≤0.001, d=0.84). At 3 h post-exercise, β-CTX 
287 
concentrations were significantly higher in the PLA trial than the IF (P≤0.001, d=1.13) and 
288 
DF trials (P=0.026, d=0.54). At 4 h post-exercise, β-CTX concentrations were significantly 
289 
lower in the DF trial than the IF (P=0.003, d=0.82) and PLA trials (P≤0.001, d=1.09) (Figure 
290 
2A). All other time points were not significantly different between trials. The overall β-CTX 
291 
response was significantly lower in the IF trial than the DF trial (P=0.019, d=0.37) and the 
292 
PLA trial (P≤0.001, d=0.84).  
293 
 
294 
N-terminal propeptides of type 1 procollagen (P1NP) 
295 
There was no main effect of Trial for P1NP, but there was for Time (P≤0.001; 𝜂𝑝

297 
concentrations were significantly increased from baseline by the end of exercise in all trials 
298 
(+32 to +33%; P≤0.001) and by 1 h post-exercise P1NP had decreased below baseline 
299 
concentrations in all trials (-3 to -7%). In the PLA trial, P1NP concentrations remained below

(+4%). In the IF trial, P1NP began to increase and reached concentrations above baseline at 3 
302 
and 4 h post-exercise (+1 to +3%) and 24 h later (+5%). In the DF trial, P1NP concentrations 
303 
continued to decrease and by 3 and 4 h post-exercise were significantly lower than baseline (-
304 
10 to -11%; P≤0.05), but were increased above baseline 24 h later (+4%) (Figure 2B). At 4 h 
305 
post-exercise, P1NP was significantly higher in the IF trial than the DF (P=0.026, d=0.20) 
306 
and PLA trials (P=0.001, d=0.25) (Figure 2B). All other time points were not significantly

312 
there was a significant Trial x Time interaction (P≤0.001; 𝜂𝑝

in all trials (-17 to -37%; P≤0.05). In the PLA trial, PTH concentrations remained below

baseline until the end of the trial (-3 to -15%) but were increased above baseline 24 h later 
317 
(+4%). In the IF trial, PTH then began to increase and reached concentrations above baseline 
318 
3 and 4 h post-exercise (+2 to +7%) and 24 h later (+1%). In the DF trial, PTH continued to 
319 
decrease and remained below baseline concentrations for the remainder of the trial (-13 to -
320 
27%) and 24 h later (-4%) (Figure 3A). At 3 h post-exercise, PTH was significantly higher in 
321

327 
there was a significant Trial x Time interaction (P=0.020; 𝜂𝑝

were increased from baseline by the end of exercise in all trials (+2 to +3%). In the PLA trial, 
329 
ACa concentrations remained above baseline until the end of the trial (+2 to +4%) but had

decreased below baseline 24 h later (-1%). In the IF trial, ACa remained above baseline (+2 
331 
to 3%) until 3 h post-exercise when ACa decreased below baseline (-3%), ACa then 
332 
increased above baseline 4 h post-exercise (+1%) and remained there 24 h later. In the DF 
333 
trial, ACa remained above baseline until the end of the trial (+2 to +4%) and returned to 
334 
baseline 24 h later (Figure 3B). At 3 h post-exercise, ACa was significantly lower in the IF 
335 
trial than the DF (P=0.008, d=0.79) and PLA trials (P=0.001, d=0.98) (Figure 3B). All other

P≤0.001). In the PLA trial, Ca2+ concentrations were still significantly below baseline by 1 h 
343 
post-exercise (-4%; P=0.002) and remained below baseline until the end of the trial and 24 h 
344 
later (-3%; P=0.006). In the IF trial, Ca2+ concentrations had returned to baseline by 1 h post-
345 
exercise (+1%) and remained at concentrations similar to baseline until the end of the trial 
346 
and 24 h later (-1%). In the DF trial, Ca2+ concentrations had almost returned to baseline by 1 
347 
h post-exercise (-1%) and remained at concentrations similar to baseline until the end of the 
348 
trial and 24 h later (-1%) (Figure 3C). At 1 h post-exercise, Ca2+ concentrations were 
349 
significantly lower in the PLA trial than the IF trial (P=0.010, d=1.41) (Figure 3C). All other

357 
to -13%). In the PLA trial, PO4 concentrations continued to decrease at 2 h post-exercise (-
358 
8%), then increased and returned to baseline 3 h post-exercise. In the PLA trial, PO4 
359 
concentrations were increased above baseline at 4 h post-exercise (+14%) and 24 h later 
360 
(+3%). In the IF trial, PO4 concentrations started to increase at 2 h post-exercise and 
361 
increased above baseline 4 h post-exercise (+8%). In the IF trial, PO4 concentrations were 
362 
below baseline 24 h later (-2%). In the DF trial, PO4 concentrations continued to decrease at 2 
363 
h post-exercise (-8%), concentrations started to increase thereafter, but remained below 
364 
baseline until the end of the trial and 24 h later (-4%) (Figure 3D). At 1 h post-exercise, PO4

Discussion 
375 
The main findings of the study are that: 1) ingestion of the CHO+PRO solution containing 
376 
1.5 g.kgBM-1 of CHO and 0.5 g.kgBM-1 of PRO suppressed β-CTX concentrations following 
377 
an exhaustive run, with a greater overall suppression when the CHO+PRO solution was 
378 
ingested immediately; 2) immediate ingestion of the CHO+PRO solution resulted in small 
379 
increases in P1NP concentrations at 3 and 4 h post-exercise; 3) delayed ingestion of the 
380 
CHO+PRO solution (2 h post-exercise) also resulted in a large suppression of β-CTX 
381 
concentrations. These findings are novel and have the potential to directly influence an 
382 
athlete’s dietary and/or training practices.  
383 
 
384 
The response in the PLA trial, showed that the exhaustive running bout caused an immediate 
385 
increase in bone turnover at the end of exercise, indicated by increased β-CTX and P1NP 
386 
concentrations above baseline. This was followed by decreased bone turnover during 
387 
recovery, indicated by decreased β-CTX and P1NP concentrations below baseline. Ingestion 
388 
of the CHO+PRO solution immediately post-exercise caused a rapid and prolonged (at least 4 
389 
h) suppression of β-CTX concentrations below baseline levels (-22 to -61%), whereas 
390 
ingesting the PLA solution immediately post-exercise meant that β-CTX concentrations were 
391 
increased above baseline by between +7 and +15%. When ingestion of the CHO+PRO was 
392 
delayed by 2 h, it caused suppression of β-CTX concentrations below baseline (-44 to -65%), 
393 
which is similar to the suppression caused by immediate ingestion of the CHO+PRO solution 
394 
and it occurred within the same timeframe, i.e., 1 – 2 h after ingestion.  
395 
 
396 
This rapid response is important because elite athletes habitually train multiple times a day, 
397 
meaning that there is often only a few hours in between training sessions and therefore 
398 
limited time for recovery and food consumption. Although the participants in the present 
399 
 19 
 
study are not elite athletes, their trained nature means that the results are relevant and may be 
400 
interpreted and used by elite athletes or practitioners. The results indicate that post-exercise 
401 
nutrient ingestion or exercise commencement can be timed so that the subsequent training 
402 
session occurs when bone resorption is at its lowest and bone formation at its highest, i.e., 3 – 
403 
4 hours after the first exercise bout with immediate ingestion of the CHO+PRO solution. This 
404 
may maximise the anabolic and minimise the catabolic bone response to the subsequent 
405 
training session, however further research is needed to investigate whether this intervention 
406 
does indeed produce a more anabolic environment for bone.  
407 
 
408 
The significant increase in P1NP concentrations (+32 to +33%) and the larger relative 
409 
increase in P1NP compared to β-CTX concentrations at the end of exercise is interesting, as 
410 
markers of bone formation are usually less responsive to acute bouts of exercise than markers 
411 
of bone resorption (13, 32, 34). Similarly, de Sousa et al. (7) reported a 77% increase in 
412 
P1NP after a high-intensity, interval running session (10 x 800m). In the present study, P1NP 
413 
concentrations then decreased to below baseline levels at 1 h post-exercise in all trials, but the 
414 
ingestion of the CHO+PRO solution immediately post-exercise caused P1NP to increase 
415 
above baseline at 3 and 4 h post-exercise by between +1 to +3%, whereas ingesting the PLA 
416 
solution immediately post-exercise meant that P1NP remained below baseline concentrations 
417 
by between -7 and -9%. When the CHO+PRO solution was ingested 2 h post-exercise, P1NP 
418 
concentrations were suppressed further below baseline concentrations (-10 to -11%). It is 
419 
possible that P1NP could have increased after the last measurement was taken but was missed 
420 
by the sampling protocol, therefore it would be useful for future research to examine a longer 
421 
post-exercise period to investigate the longer term response. The significantly increased 
422 
P1NP concentrations at 4 h post-exercise in the IF trial compared to the DF and PLA trials is 
423 
novel, and taken together, these results advocate the feeding of a CHO+PRO solution 
424 
 20 
 
immediately post-exercise in order to reduce bone resorption marker concentrations and 
425 
increase bone formation marker concentrations in the short-term recovery from intense 
426 
exercise.  
427 
 
428 
The effects of the CHO+PRO solution did not persist to the morning following exercise and 
429 
β-CTX concentrations were increased in the IF and DF trials (+8%) compared to suppressed 
430 
β-CTX concentrations in the PLA trial (-3%). P1NP was increased 24 h post-exercise in all 
431 
trials (+4 to +5%). This increased bone turnover in the IF and DF trials may reflect the bones 
432 
adapting to a possible hormonal response that is mediated by feeding. It is unlikely that the 
433 
bones are adapting to the mechanical loading from the running bout alone, as β-CTX 
434 
concentrations were not increased 24 h post-exercise in the PLA trial. The hormonal 
435 
mediators of this response are currently unknown; Scott et al. (34) and Sale et al. (29) 
436 
recently showed that GLP-2, leptin and ghrelin are unlikely mediators of the effect of CHO or 
437 
mixed meal feeding on bone turnover. Subsequently, this requires further research including 
438 
the measurement of other gastro-intestinal hormones.  
439 
 
440 
Although this increased bone turnover response may be positive in sub-elite populations, elite 
441 
athletes that train multiple times a day with minimal recovery time and rest days are more 
442 
likely to suffer from consistently increased bone remodelling, which may have detrimental 
443 
effects on bone health and enhance the stress fracture risk (25, 26, 28, 30). The trained 
444 
runners and triathletes in the present study have mean resting bone turnover marker 
445 
concentrations that are at the upper end of the reference ranges for the non-active, healthy 
446 
population (7, 11, 12). Further, unpublished data from our laboratory show that elite 
447 
triathletes have mean resting bone turnover marker concentrations that are higher than the 
448 
trained runners and triathletes. This is supported by Oosthuyse et al. (25) who showed that 
449 
 21 
 
bone resorption and bone formation markers were significantly elevated each morning after 
450 
four successive 3 h cycling bouts in well-trained cyclists. Although this is speculative, elite 
451 
athletes may experience an imbalance between whole-body rates of resorption and formation 
452 
or, defective coupling (26), meaning that neither bone resorption or bone formation is 
453 
performed adequately and the quality of the bone may be poorer. Or, athletes may experience 
454 
accelerated remodelling, which can increase bone microdamage accumulation (30), all of 
455 
which can increase stress fracture risk (1, 9, 28, 30). Indeed it should be noted that in a 
456 
normal, healthy basic multicellular unit, the suppression of bone resorption may not always 
457 
be desired, if the function of bone resorption is to breakdown and remove damaged bone at 
458 
areas of microdamage accumulation to allow the area to be repaired and strengthened. 
459 
Therefore, it is crucial for future research to investigate the long term effects of post-exercise 
460 
suppression of bone resorption on different athletic and non-athletic populations.  
461 
 
462 
Ingestion of the CHO+PRO solution post-exercise is not sufficient to cause a decrease in 
463 
bone resorption marker concentrations and/or an increase in bone formation marker 
464 
concentrations 24 h post-exercise. However, as elite athletes rarely go 24 h without a training 
465 
session and often have a second session within four hours of finishing the first session, the 
466 
bone turnover response 24 h post-exercise is less important than the immediate response as it 
467 
does not reflect real life athlete practice. The more important time point is therefore, 4 h post-
468 
exercise, as this may be around the same time that the second training session would start. As 
469 
we have now investigated the effect of post-exercise feeding after a single acute bout of 
470 
exercise, future studies should investigate the effect of post-exercise nutrient ingestion on 
471 
repeated bouts of exercise occurring on the same day.    
472 
 
473 
 22 
 
The responses of Ca2+ and PO4 to exercise are in line with previous research (37) and the 
474 
responses are only significantly different between trials at 1 h post-exercise; Ca2+ 
475 
concentrations were lower in the PLA trial compared to the IF trial, suggesting that IF 
476 
augments the recovery of Ca2+ to baseline concentrations, and PO4 is lower in the IF trial 
477 
compared to the DF trial. Transient peaks in PTH concentrations, as shown in the present 
478 
study, are shown to be anabolic for bone (10) and Townsend et al. (37) showed that PTH 
479 
secretion during exercise and recovery is controlled by both Ca2+ and PO4, therefore these 
480 
metabolites are likely to be mediating any anabolic effect of increased PTH concentrations. 
481 
The fact that PTH and P1NP follow the same response could suggest that PTH is mediating 
482 
an anabolic response in the IF trial, however this response needs to be confirmed.  
483 
 
484 
At 3 h post-exercise, PTH concentrations were greater in the IF trial than in the DF trial (+7% 
485 
vs -27%). This response coincides with significantly lower ACa concentrations at 3 h post-
486 
exercise in the IF trial compared to the DF and PLA trials (-3% vs +3 to +4%). β-CTX 
487 
concentrations were at their lowest at 3 h post-exercise in the IF trial. Considering that the 
488 
action of increased PTH secretion is to increase calcium through mobilisation of the bone 
489 
reservoir via activation of bone resorption (and also by increasing renal tubular reabsorption 
490 
and intestinal calcium absorption) (24, 35, 40), this suggests that changes in PTH and calcium 
491 
metabolism are unlikely to mediate the acute suppression in bone resorption seen with post-
492 
exercise CHO+PRO feeding. However, ACa has been shown to be unsuitable when 
493 
investigating the rapid response of calcium metabolism to exercise (37), which may also be 
494 
true when investigating CHO+PRO ingestion around exercise. Although Ca2+ (non-protein 
495 
bound calcium) decreased at the end of exercise, because albumin concentrations increased, 
496 
ACa was normalised and remained fairly unchanged throughout exercise. Changes in 
497 
albumin could have been effected by the ingestion of dietary protein throughout the recovery 
498 
 23 
 
period, which has previously been shown to increase circulating albumin concentrations (18, 
499 
20), however albumin did not change significantly throughout the recovery period. The 
500 
increase in albumin at the end of exercise could have been to encourage more calcium to be 
501 
transported around the body, due to the tissues requiring additional Ca2+ to keep up with the 
502 
demand in energy consumption, although the increase in albumin might also just reflect 
503 
haemoconcentration as a result of the running bout. Transient haemoconcentration can occur 
504 
rapidly following the onset of acute exercise, possibly even occurring in advance of any 
505 
significant losses of fluid through sweating or respiration, and it might be argued that 
506 
significant haemoconcentration would mean that changes in plasma solutes simply reflect 
507 
shifts in plasma volume. However, one might argue that the level of a plasma solute, 
508 
irrespective of plasma volume shifts, is more important, since it is this that the body responds 
509 
to. The data presented herein are uncorrected for plasma volume changes, which could 
510 
influence the interpretation of the biological data obtained during the recovery period and this 
511 
should be considered when interpreting results. It is recommended that future studies take this 
512 
into consideration and correct bone turnover marker data for plasma volume shifts, where 
513 
appropriate, perhaps even presenting these data both corrected and uncorrected for plasma 
514 
volume changes. 
515 
 
516 
In conclusion, following exhaustive running, immediate ingestion of a CHO+PRO recovery 
517 
solution may be beneficial, as it decreases bone resorption marker concentrations and 
518 
increases bone formation marker concentrations; creating a more positive bone turnover 
519 
balance. The mechanisms underlying the acute changes in bone turnover remain unknown, 
520 
but a change in calcium metabolism is unlikely to fully mediate the response.
