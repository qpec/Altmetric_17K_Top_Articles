SUMMARY
The cerebral cortex underwent rapid expansion
and increased complexity during recent hominid
evolution. Gene duplications constitute a major
evolutionary force, but their impact on human brain
development remains unclear. Using tailored RNA
sequencing (RNA-seq), we profiled the spatial and
temporal expression of hominid-specific duplicated
(HS) genes in the human fetal cortex and identified
a repertoire of 35 HS genes displaying robust and dy-
namic patterns during cortical neurogenesis. Among
them NOTCH2NL, human-specific paralogs of the
NOTCH2 receptor, stood out for their ability to pro-
mote cortical progenitor maintenance. NOTCH2NL
promote the clonal expansion of human cortical pro-
genitors,
ultimately
leading
to
higher
neuronal
output. At the molecular level, NOTCH2NL function
by activating the Notch pathway through inhibition
of cis Delta/Notch interactions. Our study uncovers
a large repertoire of recently evolved genes active
during human corticogenesis and reveals how hu-
man-specific NOTCH paralogs may have contributed
to the expansion of the human cortex.
INTRODUCTION
The cerebral cortex underwent a considerable increase in size
and complexity over the last millions of years of hominid evolu-
tion, with significant impact on the acquisition of cognitive func-
tions in the human species (Hill and Walsh, 2005; Lui et al., 2011;
Rakic, 2009; Sousa et al., 2017). As the enlargement of the hu-
man cortex is largely due to an increased number of cortical neu-
rons (Amadio and Walsh, 2006; Rakic, 2009; Sousa et al., 2017),
it is likely caused by species-specific mechanisms of cortical
neurogenesis (Borrell and Reillo, 2012; Geschwind and Rakic,
2013; Lui et al., 2011; Molna
´ r et al., 2006; Taverna et al., 2014).
Cortical neurogenesis is well conserved among mammals, but
a number of divergent features have been identified that are
linked to expansion of cortical progenitors and thereby to a
higher neuronal production in the human (Borrell and Reillo,
2012; Geschwind and Rakic, 2013; Lui et al., 2011; Molna
´ r
et al., 2006; Taverna et al., 2014). Radial glial (RG) cells, located
in the ventricular zone (VZ), constitute the major subtype of
neurogenic cortical progenitors (Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla,
2009; Pinto and Go
¨ tz, 2007). They undergo multiple cycles of
regenerative, mostly asymmetric, cell divisions, leading to the
generation of diverse types of neurons while maintaining a pool
of progenitors (Miyata et al., 2004; Noctor et al., 2004). In hu-
mans, RG cells go through an increased number of such cycles
when compared with non human-primate or mouse (Geschwind
and Rakic, 2013; Lukaszewicz et al., 2005). Timing of neurogen-
esis is likely linked to species-specific properties intrinsic to RG
cells, as it is conserved during in vitro corticogenesis from
human, non-human primate, or mouse pluripotent stem cells
(Espuny-Camacho et al., 2013; Otani et al., 2016; Suzuki and
Vanderhaeghen, 2015). Species differences in cortical neuro-
genic output are also linked to the expansion of specific classes
of progenitors in the primate and human cortex, in particular the
‘‘outer’’ radial glial (oRG) cells, located in the outer-subventricu-
lar zone (oSVZ) (Fietz et al., 2010; Hansen et al., 2010; Reillo
et al., 2011). The oRG cells emerge from RG cells later in embryo-
genesis, and their progeny tend to undergo multiple rounds
of divisions, thus providing an additional key mechanism of
increased neuronal output.
Many highly conserved signaling pathways are required for the
control of cortical neurogenesis (Tiberi et al., 2012b), which
display species-specific properties that likely contribute to diver-
gence of cortical neurogenesis (Boyd et al., 2015; Lui et al., 2014;
Rani et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016), but overall the molecular
basis of species-specific mechanisms of human corticogenesis
remain unknown. Comparative analyses of mammalian ge-
nomes led to the identification of many human-specific signa-
tures of divergence, which might underlie some aspects of
human brain evolution (Enard, 2016; Hill and Walsh, 2005;
O’Bleness et al., 2012; Varki et al., 2008). One major driver of

 phenotypic evolution relates to changes in the mechanisms con-
trolling gene expression (Carroll, 2003). Indeed, transcriptome
analyses have revealed divergent gene expression patterns in
the developing human brain (Johnson et al., 2009; Khaitovich
et al., 2006; Lambert et al., 2011; Mora-Bermu
´ dez et al., 2016;
Nord et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2005). Studies focused on the evo-
lution of non-coding regulatory elements have revealed struc-
tural changes that could lead to human brain-specific patterns
of gene expression (Ataman et al., 2016; Boyd et al., 2015;
Doan et al., 2016; Pollard et al., 2006; Prabhakar et al., 2006; Re-
illy et al., 2015), and changes at the level of coding sequences
have also been proposed to contribute to human brain evolution
(Enard et al., 2002).
Another important driver of evolution is the emergence of
novel genes (Ohno, 1999). Gene duplication (Kaessmann,
2010) is one of the primary forces by which novel gene function
can arise, where an ‘‘ancestral’’ gene is duplicated into related
‘‘paralog’’ genes (Dennis and Eichler, 2016; O’Bleness et al.,
2012; Varki et al., 2008). Particularly interesting are hominid-spe-
cific duplicated (HS) genes, which arose from segmental DNA-
mediated gene duplications specifically in the hominid and/or
human genomes (Fortna et al., 2004; Goidts et al., 2006; Mar-
ques-Bonet et al., 2009; Sudmant et al., 2010). Most of them
have emerged recently in the human lineage after its separation
from the common ancestor to great apes, during the period of
rapid expansion of the cerebral cortex. They could inherently
lead to considerable gene diversification and modification and
thereby may have contributed to the rapid emergence of hu-
man-specific neural traits. The role of the vast majority of the
HS genes remains unknown, and many could be non-functional
or redundant with their ancestral form. Recent segmental dupli-
cations are enriched for gene families with potential roles in neu-
ral development (Fortna et al., 2004; Sudmant et al., 2010; Zhang
et al., 2011), and many are found in recombination ‘‘hotspots’’
displaying copy-number variation (CNV) linked to neurodevelop-
mental disorders (Coe et al., 2012; Mefford and Eichler, 2009;
Nuttle et al., 2016; Varki et al., 2008). Finally, recent studies
have started to provide more direct evidence for the functional
importance
of
HS gene duplications,
including
SRGAP2,
ARHGAP11, and TBC1D3 (Charrier et al., 2012; Florio et al.,
2015; Ju et al., 2016). These provide the first examples of HS
gene duplications that may be linked to human cortex evolution,
but it remains unclear how many and which HS genes are actu-
ally involved in human corticogenesis. One of the roadblocks in
identifying candidate HS genes is the difficulty in distinguishing
the expression of mRNA expressed from the ancestral gene or
the HS paralogs, as their degree of conservation is usually
extremely high (Sudmant et al., 2010).
Here, we used tailored RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis
aimed at specific and sensitive detection of HS gene expression
and thus identified a specific repertoire of dozens of HS dupli-
cated genes that display robust and dynamic expression during
human fetal corticogenesis.
Among
them we discovered
NOTCH2NL, human-specific paralogs of the NOTCH2 receptor,
which stood out for their ability to promote cortical progenitor
maintenance. Functional analyses revealed that NOTCH2NL
can expand human cortical progenitors and increase their
neuronal output at the clonal level through cell-autonomous acti-
vation of the Notch pathway.
RESULTS
A Repertoire of HS Gene Duplications Expressed during
Human Corticogenesis
Previous work has identified dozens of HS gene families contain-
ing genes duplicated in the hominid and human lineage (Dennis
et al., 2017; Dumas et al., 2007; Fortna et al., 2004; Sudmant
et al., 2010), but very little information is available on their expres-
sion patterns. This is due to the difficulty to determine their
expression level with conventional methods, given the high
sequence similarity between HS paralogs of the same family.
We first sought to determine, for each HS gene family, whether
and how ancestral and paralog genes are expressed in the
human developing cortex. We performed deep sequencing of
RNA extracted from human fetal cortex at key stages of cortical
neurogenesis (from 7 to 21 gestational weeks [GW]). For the
later-stage samples, we performed microdissection to discrimi-
nate specific regions of the cortex (frontal to occipital). For the
parietal area, we further microdissected the cortical plate (CP)
and underlying domains of the cortical wall (non-CP, containing
mostly oSVZ and VZ germinal zones) to isolate compartments
enriched in neural progenitors versus postmitotic neurons.
To maximize the sensitivity and specificity of HS gene detec-
tion, we selected the libraries for cDNA fragments of 350–
700 bp and sequenced them with a 2 3 151 bp paired-ends
protocol (Figure S1A). Since HS duplications are recent evolu-
tionary events, paralogs within each family are highly similar,
potentially confusing the mapping of reads originating from indi-
vidual paralogs and estimates of their levels of expression (Fig-
ure S1B). Standard annotations on reference genomes are also
discordant for HS genes. We therefore manually curated gene
structures for these genes whenever possible (Table S1) and
developed a computational pipeline correcting the expression
estimates of closely related paralogs for mapping errors (Figures
S1C and S1D; STAR Methods). We focused on gene duplica-
tions previously described in the human genome (Sudmant
et al., 2010) followed by homology searches at the genomic
and transcript levels (Table S2).
The distribution of gene expression values for HS genes was
similar to that of all genes in the human reference genome (Fig-
ure 1A). We selected HS genes based on their absolute levels
of expression above a defined threshold, 5 fragments per
kilobase million (FPKM), corresponding to the minimal level
of a set of 60 well-defined marker genes of corticogenesis
(C) Cluster analysis of HS and cortical marker gene expression. Samples are displayed as columns. At GW21, specific subdomains were isolated: non-cortical
plate (non CP), cortical plate (CP), frontal (F), temporal (T), occipital (O), and parietal (P). Colors identify HS genes (gray) and marker genes for apical radial glia
(aRG), outer radial glia (oRG), all radial glia (panRG) and basal progenitors (BP). HS genes without an ORF are displayed in gray/black, and protein-coding HS
family genes are tagged as in (B). Heatmap colors were scaled for each individual row, scale of expression for each HS gene corresponds to (B).

 (Figure 1A). We then selected the gene families where at least
two paralogs, typically the ancestor and at least one HS paralog,
were expressed above the threshold (Figure 1B).
This selection led to a short list of 68 genes distributed among
24 gene families, displaying robust and dynamic expression dur-
ing human corticogenesis (Figure 1B; Table S2). About half of the
genes were preferentially expressed in progenitors and/or early
stages, and fewer of them in neuronal compartment and/or
late stages of corticogenesis (Figure 1C). Analysis of predicted
coding sequences revealed that 51 HS genes (including 18 po-
tential ancestor genes and 35 potentially unique to hominid
and human genomes) display an open reading frame (ORF)
that was overall conserved but distinct between paralogs of
the same family. For 17 HS genes, no reliable ORF could be de-
tected, indicating potential pseudogenization or function as non-
coding RNA (Table S2). Among the HS genes that have been
studied so far in the context of cortical development, the screen
identified SRGAP2 family genes, but neither ARHGAP11 nor
TBC1D3 as the expression of ARHGAP11B was below our
threshold and annotation for TBC1D3 family genes was unreli-
able at the time of our analysis.
The spatial specificity of expression patterns was confirmed
by in situ hybridization (ISH) in human fetal cortex samples for
21 out of 24 HS gene families (Figure 2). Specific ISH probes
for paralogs were used whenever possible, but in most cases
probes recognized more than one paralog. Specific expression
in human fetal cortex was detected for 19 out of 21 families
and revealed selective patterns at the tissue and cellular levels
(Figure 2).
We thus identify a specific repertoire of 35 protein-encoding
genes potentially unique to hominid and human genomes and
dynamically expressed during human corticogenesis. Their pat-
terns of expression suggest involvement in multiple processes,
from neurogenesis to neural circuit formation.
NOTCH2NL are NOTCH2 Paralogs Expressed during
Corticogenesis
We next focused on HS genes expressed in cortical progenitors
at the time of active neurogenesis, i.e., HS paralogs of the
CROCC, GOLGA6/8, LRRC37A/B, NBPF, NOTCH2NL, NPIP,
PDE4DIP, PMS2, and WASH gene families (Table S1). For
each HS paralog of interest, we performed in vivo gain of function
in the mouse embryonic cortex using in utero electroporation,
looking at the distribution of electroporated cells between the
VZ containing progenitors and CP containing differentiated neu-
rons. While changes in cell distribution and/or morphology
outside the VZ were noted for some of the genes (data not
shown), one particular family member, NOTCH2 N-terminal like
B (NOTCH2NLB), a NOTCH2 paralog, stood out because of its
ability to maintain cells in the VZ compartment and in the progen-
itor state (Figures 3A–3D). NOTCH2NL was therefore studied
further for potential function during human corticogenesis.
Detailed inspection of the reference genome revealed that, in
addition to NOTCH2, which is conserved in all sequenced
mammalian genomes, four additional NOTCH2 paralogs are
present in the human genome in two loci of chromosome 1 (Fig-
ure S2A). Among these four putative genes, only one has a gene
annotation in GRCh38/hg38, corresponding to the NOTCH2NL
transcript (NM_203458) identified in a previous study (Duan
et al., 2004). We named the annotated NOTCH2NL locus as
NOTCH2NLA and the other three paralogs NOTCH2NLB, C,
and R (Figures 3E and S2A). Analysis of the genomic regions re-
vealed that all four NOTCH2NL paralogs correspond to the first

 four exons and introns of NOTCH2, as the result of segmental
duplications of the NOTCH2 ancestral gene (Figure 3E). In addi-
tion, they contained a fifth exon unique to NOTCH2NL, corre-
sponding to an intronic region of NOTCH2. Three of the
NOTCH2NL paralogs (A–C), as well as several other HS genes
identified
here
during
corticogenesis
(NBPF11,
NBPF12,
NBPF14, and LINC01138), are found within the 1q21.1-2 region
(Figure S2A), very close to a CNV locus associated with micro-
cephaly and macrocephaly (Brunetti-Pierri et al., 2008; Mefford
et al., 2008). Moreover and importantly, inspection of publicly
available non-human genome sequences revealed that three
in four NOTCH2NL were detected exclusively in the human
genome, while one was detectable in the chimpanzee genome,
suggesting that NOTCH2NL duplications emerged very recently
during hominid evolution.
All NOTCH2NL paralogs are predicted to contain an ORF en-
coding a protein homologous to NOTCH2 but truncated and
including the N-terminal region of NOTCH2 extracellular domain
(Figures 3F, S2B, and S2C). Each of the four NOTCH2NLA/B/C/R
proteins encodes the six first epidermal growth factor (EGF) re-
peats of NOTCH2, followed by a specific C terminus domain
and preceded by a predicted signal peptide for two of them.
RNA-seq analyses of NOTCH2 and its paralogs revealed
similar but distinct patterns of expression (Figure 3G). NOTCH2
was highly expressed throughout corticogenesis, with a peak at
9 GW. NOTCH2NLB was expressed at lower levels at 7–9 GW
and then increased at later stages, including in the non-CP re-
gion at GW21, containing the oSVZ. A similar trend was
observed for NOTCH2NLA, although its levels were overall
lower. NOTCH2NLC and R displayed very low (<1 FPKM) levels
of expression throughout corticogenesis. The relative amount
of expression of each paralog (B > A >> C > R) was confirmed
by qRT-PCR with NOTCH2NL-specific primers followed by
direct sequencing (data not shown). Expression of NOTCH2
and NOTCH2NL paralogs was examined in more detail by
ISH (Figures 3H–3L), using a probe recognizing all four
NOTCH2NL paralogs but not the ancestral NOTCH2 and
another probe specific to the ancestral NOTCH2 mRNA (Fig-
ure S2B). This revealed similar but distinct patterns of expres-
sion in VZ at early stages, with NOTCH2 expressed mostly
along the apical part of the VZ, while NOTCH2NL genes were
detected throughout the VZ in a salt and pepper pattern at
GW9 (Figures 3H and 3I) and GW12 (Figures 2P and 2Q). At
later stages (GW21), both NOTCH2 and NOTCH2NL genes
were expressed throughout the oSVZ containing oRG cells
(Figures 3J–3L).
NOTCH2NLB Leads to Clonal Expansion of Human
Cortical Progenitors
As Notch signaling has a prominent influence on neural cell fate
(Kageyama et al., 2009; Kopan and Ilagan, 2009), NOTCH2NL
genes could act as human-specific modifiers of cortical neuro-
genesis. Given the high levels of expression of NOTCH2NLB
and its impact detected on mouse cortical progenitors, we
analyzed this specific paralog in more detail.
To characterize the role of NOTCH2NLB in human cortical pro-
genitors, we used an in vitro model of cortical neurogenesis from
human embryonic stem cells (ESC), in which the species-spe-
cific temporal dynamics of cortical neurogenesis observed in vivo
is recapitulated in vitro (Espuny-Camacho et al., 2013). In this
system, NOTCH2 was highly expressed throughout in vitro
corticogenesis, while NOTCH2NL gene expression steadily
increased until 2 months of differentiation (data not shown).
We first tested the impact of NOTCH2NLB on cortical neuro-
genesis using a gain-of-function approach, focusing on the early
stages where it is not yet expressed at peak levels. To achieve
maximal sensitivity and specificity, we used a lentiviral-based
clonal analysis (Otani et al., 2016) to measure the potential effect
of NOTCH2NL on clonal amplification and differentiation from
single cortical progenitors (Figures 4A and 4B).
In control conditions, cortical progenitors amplified gradually
to lead to a doubling of the clone size after 20 days of culture
(Figures 4C–4I), while during the same period, the number of
SOX2-positive
progenitors
per
clone
diminished
(Figures
4J–4R). Remarkably, NOTCH2NLB-expressing clones almost
tripled in size during the same period (Figure 4I), and the pro-
portion of SOX2-positive progenitors kept increasing (Figures 4Q
and 4R), thus reflecting an increased capacity of NOTCH2NLB-
expressing progenitors to expand clonally. Moreover, quantifi-
cation of the number of neurons in each clone revealed that
NOTCH2NLB clones gave a larger neuronal output than controls
(Figure 4P). These data indicate that NOTCH2NLB expression in
cortical progenitors leads to larger clone size, slower exhaustion
of progenitor pool, and ultimately, a higher number of neurons
generated.
NOTCH2NLB Promotes Progenitor Cell-Cycle Re-entry,
Mainly through Its EGF Repeats
The effects of NOTCH2NLB on clonal amplification could be due
to increased progenitor self-renewal or proliferative rate. To
distinguish between these possibilities, we examined cell cycle
and fate following 7 days of NOTCH2NL overexpression (Figures
5A–5F). This revealed an increase of progenitor fate (PAX6
expression) at the expense of neuronal fate (bIII tubulin expres-
sion). Moreover, cell-cycle kinetics assessed by short term
(1 hr) DNA labeling of the cells in S-G2 phase, as well as M phase
marker phospho-Histone H3 staining, revealed no difference
following NOTCH2NLB overexpression, suggesting no overt
effect on cell-cycle progression (Figures S3A–S3C). However,
cumulative (24 hr) DNA labeling combined with staining for all
cycling cells (Ki67) revealed a decrease in cell-cycle exit and
conversely an increase in cell-cycle re-entry following expres-
sion of NOTCH2NLB (Figures S3D and S3E). These data indicate
that NOTCH2NLB increases clonal expansion through increased

 self-renewal and/or symmetric proliferative divisions but without
overt effect on proliferative rate per se.
We next examined the molecular mechanisms underlying
NOTCH2NLB function by comparing the effect of NOTCH2NL
mutants devoid of specific domains of the protein (Figures
5G–5O). This revealed that the EGF repeats of NOTCH2NL are
critical for their function, while the C-terminal domain appears
to be dispensable. The effects of NOTCH2NL were further
confirmed in the mouse embryonic cortex in vivo (Figures S3F–
S3S). Detailed analysis of cell-fate markers indicated that the
effect of NOTCH2NL was specifically targeting PAX6-positive
apical RG cells in the VZ (Figures S3H–S3L), while no overt effect

 was detected on PAX6-positive progenitors in more basal com-
partments (that may correspond to oRG progenitors [Wang et al.,
2011]) (Figure S3M) or on TBR2-positive basal progenitors (Fig-
ures S3N–S3S).
NOTCH2NLB Directly Promotes Activation of the Notch
Pathway
As Notch signaling promotes self-renewal and blocks differenti-
ation in mouse and human cortical progenitors (Kageyama et al.,
2009; Lui et al., 2011), the effects of NOTCH2NL could be linked
to Notch activation. We tested this by examining, in the same
in vitro paradigm on human cortical progenitors, the effect of
Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) that acts as an activator of
the Notch pathway. This led to a similar effect as NOTCH2NLB,
where progenitor number increased and the number of differen-
tiated neurons decreased (Figures 5L and 5O).
To test the impact of NOTCH2NLB on Notch signaling more
directly, we examined the expression of Hes1, a direct down-
stream effector of the Notch pathway that promotes cortical
progenitor self-renewal (Kageyama et al., 2008), in response to
NOTCH2NLB and NICD expression (Figure S4). This revealed
that overexpression of NOTCH2NLB, similarly to NICD, leads
to upregulation of Hes1 and that this effect is dependent upon
the presence of EGF repeats.

 We next tested for an interaction of NOTCH2NLB with the
Notch pathway in the mouse cortex in vivo, using a Notch activity
transcriptional reporter (CBFRE-EFGP) (Mizutani et al., 2007)
(Figure 6A). This revealed that NOTCH2NLB overexpression in
mouse cortical progenitors increases Notch reporter activity
(Figures 6C and 6G), with an amplitude comparable to that
induced by NICD (Figures 6C and 6I), while no effect was ob-
tained with NOTCH2NL mutants devoid of EGF repeats (Figures
6C and 6H).
NOTCH2NLB Acts through Cell-Autonomous Inhibition
of Delta/Notch Interactions
Our data indicate that NOTCH2NL act mainly through activation
of the Notch pathway, raising the question of the molecular
mechanism involved. Since the EGF repeat domains of NOTCH
receptors are thought to bind to Notch ligands, we first tested
whether NOTCH2NLB could interact with Notch ligand Delta-
like 1 (DLL1), previously involved in cortical neurogenesis
(Kageyama et al., 2008; Kawaguchi et al., 2008; Nelson et al.,
2013; Shimojo et al., 2008).
We
performed
co-immunoprecipitation
experiments
of
NOTCH2NLB and DLL1 proteins, which revealed that both pro-
teins are found in the same complex (Figures 7A, 7B and S5). We
then hypothesized that NOTCH2NLB could directly affect DLL1
function and/or trafficking. To test this, we used a cell system
in which expression of DLL1 is transcriptionally independent of
Notch signaling (LeBon et al., 2014; Sprinzak et al., 2010) and
measured the amount of functional DLL1 protein present at the
plasma membrane and available for binding to soluble Notch1
extracellular domain added to the culture medium (Figure 7C).
In these conditions, the amount of DLL1 functionally available
at the plasma membrane was directly proportional to the total
amount of DLL1 present throughout the cell, as expected (LeBon
et al., 2014) (Figure 7D). Remarkably, the cells expressing both

 NOTCH2NLB and DLL1 displayed a strong reduction of the
amount of Notch binding at the plasma membrane compared
to control (Figures 7C–7E), revealing a reduction of functionally
available DLL1 protein at the cell surface. Importantly, overex-
pression of the NOTCH2NLB mutant devoid of EGF repeats or
of NICD showed no such effect (Figures 7D and 7E).
These data indicate that NOTCH2NLB directly impacts cell-
autonomously the amount of DLL1 functionally available at the
plasma membrane. This, in turn, could lead to a reduction of
DLL1 function in the NOTCH2NL-expressing cell. We tested
this by examining whether NOTCH2NLB expression could result
in inhibition of DLL1 function during cortical neurogenesis. DLL1

(C) CHO cell line expressing DLL1 was transfected with a NOTCH2NLB expression plasmid. DLL1 protein at the plasma membrane was detected by NOTCH1-Fc
(green in [C] and white arrows) and total DLL1 protein using DLL1 antibody (red in [C]). Anti-Myc antibody was used to identify NOTCH2NL-expressing cells (blue
in [C], white arrowhead) among non-expressing cells (open arrowheads).
(D and E) The fluorescent intensities of NOTCH1-Fc (revealing DLL1 protein at the cell plasmic membrane) and of DLL1 antibody (revealing DLL1 protein in the
whole cell) were measured in NOTCH2NLB-expressing cells and non-expressing cells (plots of three independent experiments). Compared to the non-ex-
pressing cells, NOTCH2NLB full-length-expressing cells show lower level of NOTCH-Fc signal, while NOTCH2NL-DEGF or NICD expressing cells display same
levels as control cells (D). The ratio of signals for NOTCH1-Fc over DLL1 was quantified for each individual experiment (E).
(F–L) NOTCH2NLB suppresses DLL1 function in vivo. Mouse cortex in utero electroporation (E13.5, analysis at E15.5) was performed with DLL1 alone or together
with N2NL-FL or N2NL-DEGF. Bin analysis reveals that the proportion of electroporated cells is decreased in VZ (J) and increased in CP (K) following DLL1
overexpression, which is blocked by NOTCH2NL-FL but not by NOTCH2NL-DEGF (F–K). The same results were obtained when examining the proportion of PAX6
progenitors in electroporated cells (F–I and L).
Data are presented as mean ± SEM and p values by Student’s t test (B and C) and one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni post-hoc test (H, I, and N). Scale bars, 10 mm

 expression was previously shown to exert a cell-autonomous
promotion of neuronal fate and decreased progenitor self-
renewal in the mouse cortex in vivo (Kawaguchi et al., 2008).
We therefore examined the functional interactions between
NOTCH2NLB and DLL1, by comparing the effect of DLL1
expression during mouse corticogenesis in vivo, alone or in com-
bination with NOTCH2NLB (Figures 7F–7L and S5). As predicted
(Kawaguchi et al., 2008), DLL1 overexpression led to a
decreased proportion of progenitor cells in the VZ (Figures 7F,
7G, 7J, and 7L), with a corresponding increase in neurons in
the CP (Figures 7F, 7G, and 7K). Remarkably, this effect was
completely blocked by NOTCH2NLB co-expression (Figures
7F, 7H, and 7J–7L), while the EGF repeat deletion mutant could
not counteract the DLL1 effects (Figures 7F, 7I, and 7J–7L).
Overall, these data demonstrate that NOTCH2NLB can directly
inhibit DLL1 function cell-autonomously, thereby leading to
cortical progenitor expansion.
DISCUSSION
Gene duplication is a major evolutionary driving force (Ohno,
1999), but it remains unclear whether and how many HS dupli-
cated genes may have contributed to human brain evolution.
Here, we used tailored RNA-seq analyses to detect HS dupli-
cated gene expression with great sensitivity and specificity in the
human fetal cerebral cortex. We thus identified a repertoire of 35
protein-encoding HS paralogs characterized by robust and dy-
namic expression patterns during human corticogenesis. These
data constitute a rich resource of candidate HS modifiers of
cortical neurogenesis, neuronal maturation, and neural circuit
formation. On the other hand, the vast majority of HS genes
are expressed at low or undetectable levels in the human fetal
cortex, in line with the predicted outcome of most gene duplica-
tions. While some may be of functional interest, such as
ARHGAP11B (Florio et al., 2015), most of them are unlikely to
be involved in human corticogenesis and may be in the process
of pseudogenization.
Among the HS genes identified, we discovered one important
family of paralogs of NOTCH2, NOTCH2NL, which act through
the Notch pathway to promote self-renewal and ultimately
increase neuronal output of human cortical progenitors. The
recent evolutionary emergence of NOTCH2NL paralogs makes
them attractive candidates to be involved in the latest aspects
of
human
brain
evolution,
including
increased
size
and
complexity of the cerebral cortex.
Functionally, we demonstrate that NOTCH2NLB has a critical
impact on the clonal expansion of human cortical progenitors
through a direct effect on their pool self-renewal. This effect is
strikingly in line with the expected pattern of human cortical neu-
rogenesis compared with non-human primates: human cortical
RG cells are expected to go through an increased number of
self-renewing and/or proliferative cycles compared with non-hu-
man primates (Dehay and Kennedy, 2007; Geschwind and
Rakic, 2013; Lukaszewicz et al., 2005; Otani et al., 2016). Impor-
tantly, the capacity to generate neurons for a prolonged period is
likely linked to species-specific self-renewal properties intrinsic
to RG cells, since ESC-derived RG cells from mouse, macaque,
and human follow a species-specific temporal pattern of neuro-
genesis similar to that observed in vivo (Espuny-Camacho et al.,
2013; Otani et al., 2016). NOTCH2NL act as species-specific
regulators of neurogenesis by increasing the level of self-renewal
and/or expansion of RG cells and could thereby facilitate an
extended period of neurogenesis and the larger neuronal output
that is characteristic of human corticogenesis. NOTCH2NLA/B
appear to be also expressed at high levels in oRG cells, which
have been linked to the evolutionary increase of cortical size
(Fietz et al., 2010; Hansen et al., 2010; Reillo et al., 2011).
Although we have not looked at the impact of NOTCH2NL in
oRG cells, our data strongly suggest that NOTCH2NL could
contribute to their increased expansion capacity, inasmuch
that their self-renewal is dependent on Notch signaling (Hansen
et al., 2010). Noteworthy, we do not observe increased number
of
oRG
cells
or
basal
progenitors
overexpression
of
NOTCH2NLB in the mouse cortex, implying that it mostly acts
by increasing the self-renewal capacity of apical RG cells and
not
by
promoting
the
generation
of
basal
progenitors.
NOTCH2NL function is thus distinct from the one proposed for
HS genes ARHGAP11B and TBC1D3, i.e., to promote generation
of basal progenitors (Florio et al., 2015; Ju et al., 2016). However,
importantly, our data do not exclude that NOTCH2NLB acts not
only by increasing self-renewal but also transient amplification of
cortical progenitors.
At the molecular level, we found that NOTCH2NL act mostly
through the activation of Notch signaling, the most conserved
developmental pathway controlling cell fate (Kageyama et al.,
2009; Kopan and Ilagan, 2009). Given the paramount importance
of the Notch pathway during neurogenesis (Bray and Bernard,
2010; Kageyama et al., 2009; Pierfelice et al., 2011), NOTCH2NL
may be one of many species-specific regulators of the Notch
pathway in the developing brain (Rani et al., 2016).
NOTCH2NL act, at least in part, through the inhibition of a
Notch ligand in cis, in a cell-autonomous fashion. Future work
should aim to test whether NOTCH2NLB impacts on DLL1 within
the cell, regulating trafficking of DLL1, or at the level of the
plasma membrane, where it could interfere with DLL1-binding
sites available to Notch in cis. It will be also important to deter-
mine the exact mechanism by which this leads to Notch activa-
tion: it could act through trans-signaling from neighboring cells,
as predicted by lateral inhibition models, or by blockade of Notch
cis-inhibition. Cis-inhibition is well described in several systems
(de Celis and Bray, 1997; del A
´ lamo et al., 2011; Klein et al., 1997;
Sprinzak et al., 2010), where a ligand acts as a direct inhibitor of
the Notch receptor in the cells where they are co-expressed,
thus in cis. As NOTCH2NLB can block DLL1 function when co-
expressed in the same cell, it could prevent DLL1-mediated
cis-inhibition, thereby leading tor a higher tone of Notch signaling
and progenitor self-renewal cell-autonomously. NOTCH2NL
may also act non-autonomousluy through lateral inhibition or
another direct mechanism, as it is predicted to be secreted,
and it could also bind to other Notch ligands or receptors. The
inhibition of the ability of DLL1 to signal in trans could result in
opposite proneurogenic effects in progenitors. However, data
from a companion manuscript (Fiddes et al., 2018) indicate
that NOTCH2NL can also directly activate Notch receptors
in trans. Altogether, this suggests that both non-autonomous
(through
activation
of
Notch
receptors)
and
autonomous
1380
Cell 173, 1370–1384, May 31, 2018
 (through blockade of Notch ligands) effects of NOTCH2NL could
converge to increase Notch signaling and neural progenitor
expansion.
In any case, the mechanism of action of NOTCH2NL, acting as
a positive regulator of Notch receptors including its ancestor
NOTCH2, is notably distinct from the mechanisms proposed
for SRGAP2 and ARHGAP11, for which HS paralogs also encode
a truncated form of the ancestral form. For SRGAP2, the HS pa-
ralogs have been shown to act as inhibitors of the ancestor
(Charrier et al., 2012), while ARHGAP11B is proposed to work
independently of its ancestor (Florio et al., 2015).
Our data strongly suggest that NOTCH2NL paralogs could act
as species-specific modifiers of cortical size. In line with this hy-
pothesis, NOTCH2NLA/B/C paralogs are located in the 1q21.1
genomic region, within the interval of CNV associated with path-
ological changes of brain size, where microdeletions can lead to
microcephaly, while microduplications can lead to macroce-
phaly (Brunetti-Pierri et al., 2008; Mefford et al., 2008). Given
the ability of NOTCH2NL to promote expansion of human
cortical progenitors, a change in their gene dosage following
such CNV could lead to the corresponding changes in brain
size. In striking convergence with this model, the companion
manuscript
(Fiddes
et
al.,
2018)
has
precisely
mapped
NOTCH2NLA/B at the level of microdeletions and duplications
in
patients
presenting
microcephaly
and
macrocephaly,
respectively.
In conclusion, our study reveals a selective repertoire of
human and hominid-specific gene duplications with a potentially
significant impact for human brain developmental evolution. It
includes NOTCH2NL paralogs that act as human-specific
modifiers of Notch signaling and neurogenesis, linking human
corticogenesis with recent genomic evolution and with neurode-
velopmental diseases that may strike HS genes responsible for
the distinctive size and complexity of the human cerebral cortex.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Human fetal tissue collection and preparation
The study was approved by three relevant Ethics Committees (Erasme Hospital, Universite
´ Libre de Bruxelles, and Belgian National
Fund for Scientific Research FRS/FNRS) on research involving human subjects. Written informed consent was given by the parents in
each case.
Human fetuses were obtained following medical pregnancy termination. Fetuses aged 7 gestational weeks (GW) (2 males), 9 GW
(1 male, 1 undetermined), 12 GW (1 female, 1 undetermined), 15 GW (1 male), and 21 GW (1 male) were used for the RNA sequencing
and in situ hybridization of cortical tissue. All cases were examined with standard feto-pathological procedures and none displayed
clinical or neuropathological evidence of brain malformation. As soon as possible after expulsion (less than 6 hours), the brain was
removed using standard fetal autopsy procedure (Valde
´ s-Dapena and Huff, 1983), frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction and
embedded as a whole in OCT compound (Tissue-Tek Sakura, VWR Cat# 4583), then snap-frozen in a 2-methylbutane on dry ice
bath for histological studies. The non-cortical plate and cortical plate regions of the parietal cortex of GW21 human fetal sample
are manually dissected from the 4-5 frozen sections. Sex of the samples was confirmed by the presence of RNA sequencing reads
mapped on the genes on Y chromosome. No analysis on influence or association of sex was performed because of small sample
number.
Mice
All mouse experiments were performed with the approval of the Universite
´ Libre de Bruxelles Committee for animal welfare. Mouse
housing, breeding and exeprimental handling were performed according to the ethical guidelines of the Belgian Ministry of Agricul-
ture in agreement with European community Laboratory Animal Care and Use Regulations (86/609/CEE, Journal Officiel des Com-
munautees Europeennes, L358, 18 December 1986), protocols 421N and 600N. Embryos (aged E12.5 – E18.5) of the mouse strain
ICR (CD1, Charles River Laboratory) were used for in utero electroporation. The plug date was defined as embryonic day (E)0.5, and
the day of birth was defined as P0. The data obtained from all embryos were pooled without discrimination of sexes for the analysis of
in utero electroporation, given the difficulty to determine sex identity at embryonic stages.

grown in Alpha MEM Earle’s Salts (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# 41061037), supplemented with 10% Tet System Approved FBS
(ClonTech Cat# 631106), 1X Penicillin/Streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#15070063), 2mM L-glutamine (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Cat#25030081). No authentication procedure was performed.
METHOD DETAILS
RNA sequencing
Total RNA was prepared from fetal brain tissues using the total RNA kit I (Omega, Cat# R6834-00). Poly-A tailed RNA was selected
and converted to cDNA using TruSeq standard mRNA library prep kit (TruSeq stranded mRNA library prep, illumine, Cat# Cat. No.
RS-122-2101). cDNA fragments of 350-700bp size were selected for sequencing (Blue pippin, Sage Science). 150bp of cDNA frag-
ments were sequenced from both ends using HiSeq 2500 with Rapid mode v3 (illumina).
Transcriptome analysis
Defining HS genes
All genes potentially duplicated in the hominid lineage (Sudmant et al., 2010) were first used as queries in BLAST search for NCBI
human reference genome and cDNA databases, and BLAT search on UCSC human reference genome (GRCh38/hg38) to find addi-
tional possible duplicated sister genes. This analysis identified 434 putative genes belonging to 126 gene families in total.
Annotation of human specific duplicated genes
To obtain a curated annotation file, we first downloaded the RefSeq annotation from the UCSC website. As human specific dupli-
cated (HS) genes are often poorly annotated, we designed a custom Perl script to detect the following conflicting annotations:
d same gene identifier appearing at multiple genomic loci
d multiple gene identifiers for the same genomic loci
Conflicting annotations were then manually corrected by comparing, in the UCSC Genome Browser, UCSC genes, Gencode
genes and RefSeq genes tracks. This manual curation led to a total of 342 human specific duplicated genes for which expression
was estimated by transcriptome sequencing. The corresponding GTF file was used in all subsequent analysis.
Expression bias of human specific duplicated genes
Prior to gene expression analysis, we estimated how Cufflinks multi-read correction (-u option, (Trapnell et al., 2012)) was able to deal
with human specific duplicated genes, where the fraction of multi-mappers can be excessive. To this end, we simulated RNA-seq
reads with a custom Perl script. Given a reference genome and gene annotation in GTF format, this script produces both a set of
paired fastq files and the matching ‘reference’ SAM alignment in which all read pairs are perfectly and uniquely mapped. Simulated
reads were aligned on the human reference genome hg38 with the STAR program (Dobin et al., 2013). Gene annotation used to build
the reference index was the manually curated Refseq genes previously described.
We then compared Cufflinks expression estimates obtained on the reference alignment and the STAR alignment. As expected,
Cufflinks estimates were similar for unique genes without a known paralog, but underestimated for HS genes that were closely
related.
To accurately quantify HS gene expression, we performed an alignment correction based on HS gene mappability. This method-
ology was inspired from the mappability tracks available on the UCSC Genome Browser, but applied directly to transcripts instead on
whole genome sequence. For each of the 342 curated HS genes, we simulated 1000 read pairs and mapped them back on the refer-
ence genome with the STAR program. We then counted the number of read pairs that could be uniquely remapped on each of these
genes to estimate their mappability.
Mappability values were further used to correct alignment before estimating expression with Cufflinks. First, we used HTSeq-count
(Anders et al., 2015) to count reads uniquely mapped on every HS gene. Based on their respective mappability value, we estimated
the number of reads that were lost due to multi-mapper removal and generated a BAM file with synthetic reads in numbers appro-
priate to compensate for the loss of multi-mappers. STAR alignment was merged with this compensatory alignment using samtools
merge, and this corrected alignment was used as input for Cufflinks. The whole methodology is illustrated in Supplementary
figure S1.
Sofware and parameters
Reads were aligned with the STAR program (version 2.4.0f1):

from inferring novel splice junctions. We noticed that for the specific case of HS genes located close to each other, STAR produces
many false splice junctions linking together paralogs of the same family (e.g., multiple genes of the NBPF family). Also, some default
parameters were modified to make sure that spliced reads do not receive any bonus in terms of alignment score. This way, multi-
mappers can be better identified based on their sequence identity. Multi-mappers were further removed and only concordant
read pairs were kept for further analysis.
Read counts for HS genes were obtained with HTSeq-count (version 0.6.1p1):
htseq-count -f bam -r pos -s reverse -a 0 alignement.bam genes.gtf > count.out.txt
Cufflinks (version 2.2.1) was used for gene expression and invoked with the following command:
cufflinks -o output_dir -p 5 -G genes.gtf -u -b hg38.fa–library-type fr-firststrand aln.corrected.bam
In situ hybridization
In situ hybridization using digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled RNA probes was performed as described previously using PCR amplified or
plasmid templates (Lambert et al., 2011; Lambot et al., 2005). Alternate sections were processed together in order to allow compar-
ison of the obtained staining. Cryosections of human fetal tissue were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 15min at room
temperature and washed with PBST (0.1% Tween20 in PBS) three times. Sections were soaked in 6%H2O2 in PBST for 2 minutes at
room temperature and washed three times with PBST. Subsequently sections were incubated in 1mg/ml Proteinase K in PBST for
1 minute and the reaction stopped by incubation in 2mg/ml Glycine in PBST. After washing in PBST, they were fixed again in 4%
PFA and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBST for 15 minutes at room temperature. For prehybridization, sections are incubated in hybrid-
ization solution for one hour at 70C�. The hybridization solution contains 50% formamide, 5xSSC pH4.5, 1% SDS, 50 mg/mL yeast
tRNA, and 50 mg/mL heparin. 1.5mg/ml RNA probes in the hybridization buffer were applied to sections and incubated for 16-18
hours at 70C�. The next day, sections were washed in solution ‘1‘(50% formamide, 5xSSC pH4.5, 1% SDS) for 15 minutes three times
at 70C� and then in solution ‘20 (50% formamide, 2xSSC pH4.5, 0.11% Tween-20) for 1 minute, three times, at 70C�. After TBST
(0.1% Tween20 in TBS) washing, sections were blocked in 5% sheep serum in TBST for a hour at room temperature, followed by
overnight incubation in 1/2000 anti-DIG antibody (Merck, Cat#000000011093274910) in TBST at 4C�. On the final day, anti-DIG anti-
body was washed out by TBST and followed by washing with NTMT (Tris pH 9.5 100 mM, NaCl 100 mM, MgCl2 50 mM, 0.1%
Tween-20). Signals were revealed by incubation in NBT/BCIP solution (33ml NBT and 33ml BCIP in 5ml NTMT) at room temperature.
Once signal intensity reached to the optimal level, reaction was terminated by postfixation in 4% PFA in PBS for 20 minutes at room
temperature. Sections were dehydrated with ethanol series (70%, 90% and 100% for 2 minutes for each) and mounted with the
mounting reagent (DPX Mounting Media, Merck Cat#100579). Imaging was performed using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 and the intensity
and contrast of images were modified using Fiji/ImageJ software where necessary. A sense probe was used as a negative control
in each case and revealed no specific staining.
Digoxigenin-labeled riboprobe preparation
Partial cDNA fragments of target genes are amplified by PCR using the primers designed carefully to achieve the specificity to desired
target paralogs (Table S3) and subcloned into the cloning vectors (Promega, Cat# A1360).
In vitro transcription was performed using linearized plasmids as templates, digoxigenin (DIG)-labeling mix (Roche,
Cat#11585550910)
and
the
T3,
T7
or
Sp6
RNA
polymerases
(Roche,
Cat#11031163001,
Cat#10881767001,
and
Cat#10810274001). Template DNA was degraded using DNase1 (Roche Cat#10104159001) and RNA was precipitated by ethanol
precipitation with LiCl. RNA Probes were analyzed on agarose gel to confirm the purity and the size. All the probes used in this study
are summarized in Table S3.
Cortical differentiation of human ESC
Human ESC H9 (Thomson et al., 1998) cells were cultured on mitotically inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) in the ES
medium until starting cortical differentiation. Cortical differentiation from human ESC was performed as described previously
(Espuny-Camacho et al., 2013). On day 2, cells were dissociated using Stem-Pro Accutase (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Cat#A1110501) and plated on matrigel (hES qualified matrigel BD, Cat#354277) coated dishes at low confluency (5,000–10,000
cells/cm2) in MEF-conditioned hES medium supplemented with 10 mM ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632; Merck, Cat#688000). On day 0
of the differentiation, the medium was changed to DDM (Gaspard et al., 2008), supplemented with B27 devoid of Vitamin A (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Cat#12587010) and 100 ng/ml Noggin (R&D systems, Cat#1967-NG), and the medium was replenished every
2 days. After day 16 of differentiation, the medium was changed to DDM, supplemented with B27 (DDM/B27), and changed every
2 days. At day 24, the progenitors were dissociated using Accutase and cells were resuspended in DDM supplemented with B27
and ROCK inhibitor (10 mM) and plated onto matrigel coated coverslips. Cells are amplified until day 30 in DDM supplemented
with B27 for overexpression analysis.

 Lentiviral preparation
HEK293T cells were transfected by packaging plasmids, psPAX2 (Addgene Cat#12260) and pMD2.G (Addgene Cat#12259), and a
plasmid of gene of interest in lentiviral backbone (pLenti-CAG-mCherry, pLenti-CAG-NOTCh2NLB-ires-EGFP, pLenti-CAG-
NOTCH2NL-DEGF-ires-EGFP, pLenti-CAG-NOTCH2NL-DC-ires-EGFP and pLenti-CAG-NICD-ires-EGFP). 2 days after transfec-
tion, culture medium was collected and viral particles were enriched by filter device (Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifuge Filters, Merck,
Cat#UFC910008). Titer check was performed on HEK293T cell culture for every batch of lentiviral preparation.
Clonal analysis
Clonal analysis was performed as described in the previous study with some modifications (Otani et al., 2016). Cortical cells derived
from human ESC were grown on Matrigel-coated coverslips in DDM supplemented with B27 until day 28 in 24 well plate and the
coverslips are transferred to 6 well plate (3 coverslips per well). At day 30, the mixture of viruses of Lenti-CAG-mCherry and
Lenti-CAG-NOTCH2NLB-ires-EGFP was applied to cells at optimized concentration (which is defined every batch of viral prepara-
tion). The medium was changed to fresh DDM supplemented with B27 to wash lentiviruses out one day after intitial infection and the
medium subsequently changed every 2-3 days. Each coverslip in a culture well was fixed and immunostained at day 35 (5 days of
lentiviral overexpression), day 40 (10 days of lentiviral overexpression) or day 50 (20 days of lentiviral overexpression). The cells with
lentiviral overexpression were detected by anti-mCherry and anti-GFP antibodies and the cell types were determined by anti-SOX2
and anti-bIII tubulin antibodies for the cortical progenitors and the differentiated neurons, respectively. The clonal size was defined as
a number of cells per cluster, in which cells are located in close proximity from each other and are spatially isolated from the neigh-
boring cell clusters in a distance longer than 100mm.
Acute overexpression in human cortical cells
Lentiviral constructs were used to infect at day 30 cortical cells differentiated from human ESC. Cortical cells are prepared as
described in the section of clonal analysis. One day after infection, culture medium was changed to wash viruses out. Phenotypes
were analyzed 3 and 7 days after infection for Hes1 immunoreactivility and neurogenesis assay by PAX6, SOX2 and bIII tubulin
antibodies, respectively.
Cell cycle labeling assay
A nucleotide analog 5-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine (EdU; Merck, Cat#T511285) was incorporated to human cortical cells 24 hours before
fixation for cell cycle exit analysis and 1 hour before fixation for G2/S phase labeling. Detection of EdU was performed using Click-iT
EdU Alexa Fluor 488/647 Imaging Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# C10337 and Cat#C10340,). For the cell cycle exit analysis, the
percentage of cells with EdU-positive and a proliferative cell marker Ki67-negative was examined.
In utero electroporation
In utero electroporation was performed as described previously (Dimidschstein et al., 2013; Tiberi et al., 2012a). Briefly, timed-preg-
nant mice were anesthesized with a mixture of ketamine (Ketalar, 50mg/ml solution injectable, Pfizer) and xylazine (Rompun, 2% so-
lution injectable, Bayer) at E13.5, and each uterus was exposed under sterile conditions. Plasmid solutions containing 1-1.5 mg/ml of
DNA were injected into the lateral ventricles of the embryos using a heat-pulled capillary. Electroporation was performed using twee-
zer electrodes (Nepa Gene, Cat#CUY650P5) connected to a BTX830 electroporator (five pulses of 25 V for 100 ms with an interval
of 1 s). Embryos were placed back into the abdominal cavity, and mice were sutured and placed on a heating plate until recovery.
DNA constructs
Coding sequence of NOTCH2NLB was amplified by PCR from the cDNA library derived from GW9 human fetal cortex using the
primers designed on the basis of the sequence of reference genome. The size of PCR fragment was confirmed and PCR fragment
was subcloned into the multicloning site before myc tag of a CAG promoter driven expression plasmid (pCAG-IRES-GFP (Dimidsch-
stein et al., 2013; Tiberi et al., 2012a)) by In Fusion cloning (Clontech, Cat#638909). DNA fragment of CAG-NOTCH2NLB-ires-EGFP
was transferred to lentiviral plasmid backbone (gift from Cecile Charrier) by restriction digestion and ligation to obtain a lentiviral
overexpression
construct
of
NOTCH2NLB
(pLenti-CAG-NOTCH2NLB-myc-ires-EGFP).
NOTCH2NL
deletion
constructs
(NOTCH2NL-DEGF repeats and NOTCH2NL-DC terminus) were prepared by PCR amplification using the primers recognizing the
desired part of NOTCH2NLB and insertion into the lentiviral vector by In Fusion cloning (pLenti-CAG-NOTCH2NL-DEGF-myc-
ires-EGFP and pLenti-CAG-NOTCH2NL-DC terminus-myc-ires-EGFP). These lentiviral NOTCH2NL plasmids were further modified
by replacing EGFP to mCherry for some experiments. Lentiviral overexpression construct of mouse Notch1 intracellular domain
(NICD) was prepared by insertion of 3xflag tagged NICD PCR amplified from the plasmid purchased from Addgene (#20183, (Ong
et al., 2006)) into pLenti-CAG-ires-EGFP plasmid. Retroviral overexpression construct of rat Delta like-1 (pMX-rDll1-iG) was a gift
from Dr. Gotoh (Kawaguchi et al., 2008). The coding sequence of DLL1 C-terminally tagged with HA was amplified by PCR to obtain
DNA fragment of DLL1-HA and inserted into lentiviral CAG promoter driven overexpression plasmid (pLenti-CAG-DLL1-HA). CBFRE-
EGFP was originally developed in a previous study (Mizutani et al., 2007) and obtained from Addgene (#17705). pCAGGS-NICD
(Addgene #126891, (Dang et al., 2006)) was used for in utero electroporation.

 Immunofluorescence staining
Mouse embryos were collected 2 days after electroporation and perfused transcardiacally with ice-cold 4% PFA in PBS. Brains were
dissected and soaked in 4% PFA solution overnight at 4�C and then sectioned in 100mm thickness using vibrosector (Leica,
Cat#VT1000S). Slices were washed with PBST three times and transferred into the blocking solution, which is PBS containing
0.3% Triton X-100 and 3% horse serum, and incubate for 1 hour. Brain slices were incubated overnight at 4�C with the primary an-
tibodies. After three PBST washes, slices were incubated in PBST during 2 hours at room temperature with the secondary antibodies.
After washing in PBST, brain sections are amounted on a slide glass with the mounting reagent (DAKO glycerol mounting medium,
Cat#C0563). For the human cortical cells, the cells on coverslips were fixed in ice cold 4% PFA in PBS for 15 minutes at room tem-
perature, washed three times with PBST and blocked for 1 hour in the same blocking solution used for mouse brain sections. Then
coverslips were incubated in the blocking solution containing primary antibodies overnight at 4�C. Coverslips were washed three
times in PBST and incubated in PBST containing the secondary antibodies. Coverslips were mounted on a slide glass with the
mounting reagent. Imaging was performed using a confocal microscope Zeiss LSM780 and Images are processed by Fiji/ImageJ
software (Schindelin et al., 2012).
Detection of DLL1 protein on the plasma membrane
Engineered CHO cell lines, which expresses Delta like-1 C-terminally fused with mCherry under the tetracyclin-dependent promoter
(Sprinzak et al., 2010), were used for this analysis. Experimental scheme was modified from the preceding studies (LeBon et al., 2014;
Sprinzak et al., 2010). Cells were transfected with the overexpression plasmid of either C-terminally myc-tagged NOTCH2NLB,
C-terminally myc-tagged NOTCH2NL deletion mutant of EGF repeats or NICD, using the X-tremeGENE HP DNA Transfection Re-
agent (Merck, Cat#6366244001). Then cells were passaged and grown in low confluency (20,000 cells/cm2) in CHO cell medium
(alpha MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1X Penicillin/Streptomycin, and L-Glutamine) containing 100ng/ml Doxycycline hydro-
chloride (Merck, D3447). Recombinant chimeric protein of Notch1 extracellular domain fused with mouse Fc fragment of IgG
(Notch1-Fc, R&D systems, Cat#5267-TK-050) was applied to the culture medium and incubated on ice for 1 hour. Cells were acutely
fixed in 4% PFA in PBS for 15 minutes on ice and washed with PBST three times. Then cells were permeabilized and blocked in the
blocking solution containing 0.3% Triton X-100, and followed by the incubation in the blocking solution containing primary antibodies
overnight; anti-DLL1 (rabbit, Santa Cruz, Cat#sc9102) and anti-Myc (goat, abcam, Cat#ab9132) antibodies. On the next day, cells
were washed and labeled with the secondary antibodies; anti-Mouse IgG antibody conjugated with Alexa488 for the detection of
Notch1-Fc, anti-Rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with Alexa405 for the detection of DLL1 and anti-Goat IgG antibody conjugated
with Alexa647 for the detection of Myc. Images containing three channels were obtained using a confocal microscopy Zeiss
LSM780. Myc-positive NOTCH2NL-expressing cells and Myc-negative control cells were imaged in whole Z axis with the interval
of 0.6mm.
Confocal microscopy
Confocal images were obtained with Zeiss LSM 780 driven by ZEN 2012 software and equipped with 10x 0.30, 20x 0.8 and 40x 1.1W
objectives. Microscope disposed of argon, helium-neon and 405 nm diode lasers.
Co-immunoprecipitation and western blot
36 hours after transfection of NOTCH2NLB-myc and DLL1-GFP in HEK293T cell, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20mM Tris-HCl
pH7.4, 120mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1mM EDTA, 10% Glycerol, Protease inhibitor and 1mM PMSF) on ice. Samples were incu-
bated with Myc-trap (yta-10, ChromoTek) or GFP-trap (gta-10, CHromoTek) magnetic beads Overnight with rotation at 4�C. Beads
were washed by the wash buffer (50mM Tris-HCl pH 8.00, 150mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% Sodium deoxycholate and 10% Glycerol)
four times. Subsequently, samples were eluted in 2x Laemuli’s buffer at 55�C. The input and immunoprecipitated samples were run in
NuPAGE 4%–12% Bis-Tris Protein Gel (NP0321BOX, ThermoFisher Scientific) at the voltage of 100V for 2.5 hours and then trans-
ferred to Nitrocellulose Blotting Membrane (Cat. # 10600000, Amersham Protran 0.1um NC) at the voltage of 100V for 100 minutes.
The membrane was blocked in the buffer (5% skim milk and 0.1% Tween20 in TBS) for 1 hour at 4�C and subsequently incubated in
the blocking buffer containing anti-GFP (rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal antibody, ab290, abcam) or anti-Myc (mouse anti-Myc mono-
clonal antibody 9E10, M4439-100UL SIGMA) antibodies overnight at 4�C, followed by the incubation in the blocking solution
containing secondary antibody anti-Rabbit or Mouse IgG antibody conjugated with HRP (NA931-1ML, GE healthcare) at room tem-
perature for 1 hour. Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Cat. #32106, ThermoFisher Scientific) was used for signal detection.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

 In utero electroporation in mouse
For quantification of the results of in utero electroporation experiments, we obtained the image of whole cortical thickness in the
columnar imaging window with a 300mm width at the center of electroporation. In every experiment, we obtained multichannel im-
ages of fluorescent marker EGFP or mCherry to identify electroporated cells and immunostaining of one or two antibodies in addition
to Hoechst33342 counter staining. We counted the numbers of electroporated cells by fluorescent markers EGFP or mCherry in the
cortical regions from the most apical ventricular zone to the most basal cortical plate (CP). For E15.5 and E16.5 samples, four regions
(VZ, SVZ, IZ and CP) were determined by the cellular density revealed by Hoechst 33342 and by the VZ marker PAX6 (VZ; dense/
PAX6-positive, SVZ; dense/PAX6-negative, IZ; sparse, and CP; dense). For E18.5 samples, six regions (VZ, SVZ, IZ, SP, lower
and upper CP) were determined by cellular density and the PAX6 and MAP2 immunostainings (VZ: dense/PAX6-positive, SVZ;
dense/PAX6-negative, IZ; sparse, SP; sparse/MAP2-strongly positive, CP; dense/MAP2-weakly positive). The CP was further sub-
divided equally into the lower and upper parts.
For all analyses, 10-20 embryos were used from at least 3 litters for each condition and time-point considered, in which 100-300
cells were counted in a coronal section of electroporated cortex at an equivalent rostrocaudal level. The percentage of electroporated
cells in each region is determined as the number of electroporated cells in a given region divided by the total number of electropo-
rated cells in whole cortical wall. The percentage of PAX6 or TBR2-positive cells are defined as the number of PAX6/TBR2 immuno-
positive electroporated cells in the regions the VZ or SVZ over total number of electroporated cells in whole cortical wall. Similarly, the
percentage of NOTCH reporter-positive cells are defined as the number of NOTCH reporter-positive electroporated cells over the
total number of electroporated cells in whole cortical wall.
Clonal analysis
The number of cells with lentiviral overexpression per clonal cluster was counted for 25-30 clusters of each condition (control-
mCherry and NOTCH2NLB-ires-EGFP) in each experiment. By repeating and pooling the data of three independent experiments,
we obtained the clonal size for 80-100 clones for each tested condition.
Detection of DLL1 protein on the plasma membrane
Under the culture condition that 2-10 cells are making an isolated cluster with a significant distance from neighboring one, we
selected clusters of solely Myc-positive (NOTCH2NLB-overexpression) or Myc-negative cells (non overexpression as control) to
avoid the mixed cellular cluster. For each cluster of cells, a series of confocal images were obtained along the Z axis with a
0.6mm interval, in which each image contains three channels of NOTCH1-Fc (Alexa488), DLL1 (Alexa405) and NOTCH2NLB-overex-
pression by Myc immunofluorescence (Alexa647). The signal intensities of NOTCH1-Fc and DLL1 were measured in every optical
section for a cell cluster and pooled to quantify total NOTCH1-Fc signal and total DLL1 signal for a given cluster of cells. These values
from 20-30 clusters per experiment were plotted in two-dimensional scatterplot we then drew regression lines for each signals
using R. Then the ratio of NOTCH1-Fc signal over DLL1 signal was calculated for all clusters analyzed. Data are represented as
mean ± sem, p-values were determined from Student’s t tests performed for each one of the three independent experiments.

 Supplemental Figures
Figure S1. Transcriptome Analysis: Correcting for Loss of Multimapping Loss, Related to Figure 1
(A) The mappability of a gene is defined as the number of reads uniquely mapped on this gene divided by the number of reads originating from its transcripts. It is
computed from simulated transcriptomes, as explained above and depicted in panel C. Most reads originating from single copy genes are uniquely mapped on
the reference genome regardless of sequencing length, hence they have a mappability of one. HS genes show lower mappability values. As expected, their
mappability is inversely related to read length.
(B) When setting simulated read length to 2x 151bp, which is the length used for transcriptome sequencing in this study, only half of the HS genes show
mappability values above 90%.
(C) Computational correction of expression for human specific paralogs. Paralogs within each HS gene families are highly similar; potentially confusing the
mapping of reads originating from individual paralogs. As a result, some reads are discarded because they map to multiple paralogs, leading to expression under-
estimation. To estimate this loss quantitatively, an alignment of simulated reads (BAM file) is generated for each gene (gray alignment) at a defined coverage (see
methods). This simulated alignment is ideal as it assumes a uniform coverage of the genes, and importantly the reads are manufactured and placed on reference
genome, i.e., no read mapping procedure is involved, hence there is no mapping ambiguity. These simulated reads are then extracted and aligned with the same
alignment procedure as used for in vivo experimental data (see methods; orange alignment, crosses on the gene structures denote unique sequence features
allowing unambiguous mapping). Many reads are lost in the process due to multimapping, but we can estimate how many, since we initially generated them in
(legend continued on next page)
 known quantity (i.e., gray alignment). Finally, when aligning reads from in vivo experiments (green alignment), these estimates are used to inject in the alignments
the near-exact number of additional reads to compensate for the loss of multimapping reads (purple alignment).
(D) Example of correction: FPKM values computed without (light gray) and with the simulation-based correction (dark gray) for 5 paralogous genes of the NOTCH2
family and HES1 as an example of single copy gene.

NOTCH2 (Uniprot; Q04721). The variable amino acid residues, except for those in the C terminus, are indicated by asterisks.
 Figure S3. NOTCH2NLB Promotes Cell-Cycle Re-entry and Maintenance pf Cortical Progenitors, Related to Figure 5
(A–C) The percentage of mitotic cells and the cells in G2/S phase are quantified using anti-phospho Histone H3 and EdU labeling Cell cycle exit in the human
cortical progenitors derived from ESC; NOTCH2NLB introduced by lentiviral infection at day 30 of differentiation, EdU incorporated 24 hours before fixation at day
7 of overexpression.

 (F–S) In utero electroporation of NOTCH2NLB full length (N2NL-FL), NOTCH2NL-EGF repeats deletion (DEGF) and mouse NOTCH1 intracellular domain (NICD) in
E13.5 mouse cortex, followed by analysis at E15.5. Bin analysis of fractions of mCherry+ electroporated cells in four regions, the CP, IZ, SVZ and VZ (F and G)
PAX6 immunoreactivility was examined to quantify the proportion of apical and basal RG progenitors following NOTCH2NL overexpression (H-M). Proportions of
PAX6-positive cells in the VZ (L) and SVZ (M) among all electroporated cells in whole cortical thickness are quantified. TBR2 immunoreactivility is examined to
quantify the proportion of basal/intermediate progenitors in these four conditions (N-S). Proportion of TBR2-positive cells in the VZ (R) and SVZ (S) among all
electroporated cells in whole cortical thickness are quantified.
Data are represented as mean ± sem and p values by Student’s t test (B, C and E) one-way ANOVA and bonferroni post hoc test (H, I, P, Q, X and Y). Scale bars;
100mm (A, D, F, L, R and T) and 20mm (A1, A2, D1, D2, J, K and S).
 Figure S4. NOTCH2NL Activates Notch Signaling in Human Cortical Progenitors In Vitro, Related to Figure 6
(A–E) Notch signaling activity was examined by HES1 immunoreactivity as a positive readout of NOTCH signaling in human cortical cells, 3 days following lentiviral
infection with control vector (GFP only) or leading to overexpression of NOTCH2NL full length (N2NL-FL), NOTCH2NL-EGF repeats deletion (DEGF) or NICD.
(F) Quantification of HES1-immunoreactive cells among GFP labeled cells in each condition.
Data are represented as mean ± sem and p values by one-way ANOVA and bonferroni post hoc test. Scale bars; 100mm (A) and 20mm (B).
 Figure S5. Functional Interaction of DLL1 and NOTCH2NL during Mouse Corticogenesis In Vivo, Related to Figure 7
(A and B) Original pictures of the result of co-immunoprecipitation of overexpressed NOTCH2NLB-full length-myc (N2NLFL-myc) and DLL1-GFP. The regions in
the magenta rectangles are cropped for Figures 7A and 7B.
(C) Bin analysis of the regional distribution of electroporated cells in the mouse cortex 2 days after in utero electroporation at E13.5. The fraction of electroporated
cells in the VZ and CP are highlighted in Figures 7J and 7K. Four conditions, Control mCherry alone, DLL1, DLL1 + NOTCH2NLB full length (DLL1+N2NL-FL),
DLL1 + NOTCH2NL EGF repeats deletion (DLL1+DEGF), were tested.
Ventricular zone (VZ), the subventricular zone (SVZ), the intermediate zone (IZ), and the cortical plate (CP).
Data are represented as mean ± sem and p values by one-way ANOVA and bonferroni post hoc test.
