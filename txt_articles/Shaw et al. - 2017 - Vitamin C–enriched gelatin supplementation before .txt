ABSTRACT
Background: Musculoskeletal injuries are the most common com-
plaint in active populations. More than 50% of all injuries in sports
can be classified as sprains, strains, ruptures, or breaks of musculo-
skeletal tissues. Nutritional and/or exercise interventions that in-
crease collagen synthesis and strengthen these tissues could have
an important effect on injury rates.
Objective: This study was designed to determine whether gelatin
supplementation could increase collagen synthesis.
Design: Eight healthy male subjects completed a randomized, double-
blinded, crossover-design study in which they consumed either 5 or 15 g
of vitamin C–enriched gelatin or a placebo control. After the initial drink,
blood was taken every 30 min to determine amino acid content in the
blood. A larger blood sample was taken before and 1 h after consump-
tion of gelatin for treatment of engineered ligaments. One hour after the
initial supplement, the subjects completed 6 min of rope-skipping to
stimulate collagen synthesis. This pattern of supplementation was re-
peated 3 times/d with $6 h between exercise bouts for 3 d. Blood
was drawn before and 4, 24, 48, and 72 h after the first exercise bout
for determination of amino-terminal propeptide of collagen I content.
Results: Supplementation with increasing amounts of gelatin increased
circulating glycine, proline, hydroxyproline, and hydroxylysine, peak-
ing 1 h after the supplement was given. Engineered ligaments treated
for 6 d with serum from samples collected before or 1 h after subjects
consumed a placebo or 5 or 15 g gelatin showed increased collagen
content and improved mechanics. Subjects who took 15 g gelatin 1 h
before exercise showed double the amino-terminal propeptide of colla-
gen I in their blood, indicating increased collagen synthesis.
Conclusion: These data suggest that adding gelatin to an intermit-
tent exercise program improves collagen synthesis and could play
a beneficial role in injury prevention and tissue repair. This trial was
registered at the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry as
ACTRN12616001092482.

INTRODUCTION
The structure and function of musculoskeletal tissues, such as
tendon, ligaments, cartilage, and bone, are dependent on their
collagen-rich extracellular matrix. This matrix, in turn, derives its
function from the amount and the crosslinking of this collagen
(1, 2) together with the water or mineral within the tissue (3). In
disease states or in the presence of a nutritional or genetic in-
sufficiency, a poor extracellular matrix is produced that is unable
to withstand the mechanical demands of normal activity (4).
While poor nutrition, genetics, and disease can make con-
nective tissue prone to failure, adequate nutrition together with
exercise normally improves the function of the matrix (5). Acute
exercise is known to increase collagen synthesis (6–8) as well as
the expression of the primary enzyme involved in collagen
crosslinking, lysyl oxidase (9). The result is a denser and stiffer
tissue after training (10) that is stronger (it fails at a higher load) (11).
With the high stresses placed on these musculoskeletal tissues,
injuries are extremely common in sports (12–16), disease (17),
and aging (18). Although musculoskeletal injuries are extremely
common and have huge personal, competitive, and financial
costs, very few advances have been made in preventing and
treating these injuries.
To better understand tendon and ligament biology, we have
developed a tissue-engineered model that mimics the developing
tissue (19–21). Like developing tendons and ligaments, these tis-
sues have more cells and less matrix (22), synthesize collagen at
a faster rate (23), have more developmental isoforms of collagen
(24), and are much weaker than adult ligaments (21). Despite these
differences, engineered ligaments respond to physiologic stimuli in
a manner that is quite similar to the native tissue (25–28).
Findings from these engineered tissues that the presence
of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and the amino acid proline can
increase collagen production and engineered ligament me-
chanics (21) together with work by Vieira and colleagues (29),
who showed that increasing glycine intake improves the mechanics

 of Achilles tendons after injury, suggest that a nutritional in-
tervention that increases amino acid components of collagen and
the cofactor vitamin C may improve collagen synthesis.
As a result of this background, in the current study we used
a randomized, crossover-design protocol to test the hypothesis that
consuming gelatin (a food derivative of collagen) and vitamin C
combined with exercise could increase collagen synthesis.
METHODS
Subjects, blood sampling, and exercise intervention
Eight healthy, recreationally active young men (mean 6
SEM: 27 6 6 y, 79.6 6 12 kg) provided written consent to
a protocol that was approved by the Australian Institute of
Sport human research ethics committee and that was written
in accordance with standards set by the Declaration of Hel-
sinki. The protocol was submitted to the Australian New
Zealand Clinical Trials Registry and given the registration
number ACTRN12616001092482. Subjects arrived at the
laboratory after an overnight fast (Figure 1). The antecubital
vein of the arm was cannulated and an initial baseline blood
sample collected (time = 21 h). Subjects were then imme-
diately provided with the isocaloric treatment containing 0, 5,
or 15 g gelatin dissolved in a flavored low-calorie beverage
containing 48 mg vitamin C. Subjects rested for 1 h after the
ingestion of the supplement during which period 2 blood
samples were taken (230 min and 0 h). Subjects then com-
pleted 6 min of continuous rope skipping to load the mus-
culoskeletal system. After completion of the exercise task,
subjects were required to remain in the laboratory in a rested
state for the subsequent 4 h, during which time a further 4
blood samples were collected. After the blood sample at 4 h,
the cannula was removed, and subjects were allowed to leave
the laboratory. On departure, they were provided with a skipping
rope and instructed to complete a further 3 sessions/d of 6 min of
continuous skipping with a minimum of 6 h between each bout of
exercise. The subjects ingested their supplement, which was
provided in a blinded manner, 1 h before each rope-skipping
session.
Blood samples were drawn from the cannula at 8 time points
throughout the acute testing session (at 21, 20.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 2,
and 4 h) with 5-mL saline flushes every 30 min to prevent the
cannula from clotting. Blood from the collections at 21, 20.5,
0, 0.5, 1, and 2 h was used for amino acid analysis (see below).
The blood draws at the 21 and 0 h time points were of a greater
volume (50 mL) for use in tissue culture. The blood samples
for tissue culture were allowed to clot and were centrifuged
(1500 3 g; 10 min), and the resulting sterile serum was used in
place of fetal bovine serum during the treatment of the engineered
ligaments. The subjects returned to the laboratory for blood draws
24, 48, and 72 h after the initial bout of exercise. These blood draws,
together with the draw at 4 h, were processed for N-terminal peptide
of pro-collagen I (PINP)9 analysis as described below. The PINP
blood draw on day 2, 3, and 4 was taken before the subjects
completed their first rope-skipping session of the day (12 h
after the last exercise bout).
Nutritional supplement
Subjects were provided with 0, 5, 15 g gelatin (Ward
McKenzie Pty Ltd.) in an isocaloric beverage. Maltodextrin
(Polyjoule) was used to weight- and calorie-match the placebo
and gelatin treatments. Subjects were provided with 9 single
doses of the dry treatment ingredients sealed in separate enve-
lopes. Subjects were instructed to make the treatment beverage by
emptying the contents of each packet into the vitamin C con-
centrate (low-calorie blackcurrant cordial 80 mL; Ribena light,
Lucozade Ribena Suntory Limited; 48 mg vitamin C/80 mL)
mixed with 400 mL water in an opaque drink bottle that was
provided. Subjects were instructed to consume the beverage as
quickly as possible 1 h before exercise. Treatments were ran-
domly assigned to avoid an order effect and were separated by
a washout period of 4 d to minimize the effect of the previous
treatment. All subjects completed all treatments. Washout was
successful because PINP levels were not different in the baseline
samples between trials.
Amino acid content of the blood
Whole blood was collected in 6-mL lithium heparin vacu-
tainers. Tubes were immediately centrifuged at 3260 3 g at room
temperature for 10 min. The resulting plasma was separated into
single 2.5-mL cryotubes and stored at 2808C until subsequent
analysis. Amino acid concentrations were quantified at the
University of California, Davis Proteomics Core facility by HPLC.
Briefly, serum samples were hydrolyzed in 6N HCl for 24 h at
1108C, and 50 mL 10% sulfosalicylic acid was added to 200 mL
of the hydrolyzed serum samples. This mixture was diluted
1:2.5 in aminoethylation-cysteine buffer, and a 50-mL injection
volume was analyzed by using a Hitachi L-8900 High-speed
Amino Acid Analyzer (Hitachi High-Technologies). The sec-
ondary analysis of the amino acid content was performed under
blinded conditions.
Engineered ligament formation
Engineered ligaments were formed by using primary human
anterior cruciate ligament cells obtained after receiving written
consent for a protocol approved by the Institutional Review
Board at the University of California, Davis. The anterior cruciate
ligament tissue used in the current study was obtained from 1
healthy, young male donor, and the cells were isolated as de-
scribed previously (28). The primary fibroblasts were expanded
in growth media consisting of DMEM containing 10% fetal
bovine serum and 1% penicillin, and aliquots of the cells were
frozen until needed for experiments. Frozen cells were thawed
and expanded to passage 4–5 before formation of engineered
ligaments, as described previously (21). Briefly, 2.5 3 105 cells
were embedded in a 1-mL fibrin gel (containing 5.8 U thrombin,
5.72 mg fibrinogen, 20 mg aprotinin, 200 mg 6-aminohexanoic
acid) on 35-mm plates containing 2 cylindrical brushite (calcium
phosphate) cement anchors placed 12 mm apart. Over the next
4 d, the cells contracted the fibrin into a ligament-like sinew
between the 2 brushite anchors (21). Constructs were maintained
in 2 mL feed media consisting of growth media supplemented

 with 5 ng/mL transforming growth factor-b1 (Peprotech), 200 mM
ascorbic acid (Sigma), and 50 mM proline (Sigma), which was
refreshed every other day.
Engineered ligament treatment and analysis
Once fully formed (day 8 after plating), engineered ligaments were
treated for 6 d with experimental media containing blood taken
before supplementation (PRE) or 1 h after consuming the supplement
containing 0, 5, or 15 g gelatin. The experimental media contained
only DMEM, 1% penicillin, and 10% of the serum from the subject.
The tissue engineer who treated and tested the engineered ligaments
was blinded to the serum treatments. Six constructs per condition per
serum donor were treated, and the mean was used for all analysis.
Serum from 4 of the 8 subjects was used with the engineered
ligaments. All of the trials showed the same response, and the
data from subject 5 is shown as a representative sample.
At the end of the 6-d treatment, constructs were tensile-tested as
described previously (27). Briefly, the length and cross-sectional
area (CSA) of the ligaments were determined by using digital
calipers. The anchors were then placed into grips attached to
a stepper motor and a force transducer. The ligaments were
stretched by using a custom LabView program (National In-
strument) at a rate of 0.4 mm/s until failure without precondi-
tioning, and the resulting force-deformation data were used to
calculate maximal tensile load (MTL). By using the initial length
and CSA, stress and strain were calculated, and from this in-
formation the ultimate tensile stress and modulus (stiffness) of
the ligaments were established. After tensile testing, constructs
were dried and weighed before determining hydroxyproline
content (30). Briefly, each sample was hydrolyzed in 6 N HCl and
dried at 1208C. The resulting pellet was resuspended in hy-
droxyproline buffer. An aliquot was diluted 1:4–200 mL, com-
bined with 150 mL chloramine T solution for 20 min, and then
combined with 150 mL aldehyde-perchloric acid for 15 min at
608C. Absorbance was read at 550 nm on an Epoch Microplate
Spectrophotometer (BioTek Instruments Limited). Hydroxyproline
was converted to collagen mass assuming that collagen contains
13.7% hydroxyproline (28). The collagen fraction was determined
by dividing the collagen content by the mass of the tissue.
PINP
Whole blood was collected in a 3.5-mL serum separating tube
and allowed to clot for 2 h before centrifugation at 1000 3 g for
10 min. Samples were then aliquoted into 0.5-mL cryotubes and
immediately frozen at 2808C until processed. These samples were
later used to measure PINP concentrations with an ELISA kit
(Novatein Biosciences). Samples were measured in duplicate ac-
cording to manufacturer’s protocol by using a SPECTROstar Nano
microplate reader (BMG Labtech). The Intraclass Correlation
Coefficients for the ELISA assay is r = 0.984, and the sensitivity of
the assay is 1.0 ng/mL. The researcher performing the analysis of
PINP was also blinded to the treatment intervention.
Statistics
Amino acid content and PINP levels were analyzed by 2-factor
ANOV
A with one factor being time and the other being gelatin in
the supplement. Post hoc test with the use of Tukey’s multiple-
comparisons test was performed to determine the effect of the treat-
ments. Engineered ligament data were analyzed by 1-factor ANOV
A
with Tukey’s post hoc for the different gelatin levels in the supple-
ment (GraphPad Prism, v.5). Data are presented as means 6 SEMs,
and the significance level was set at a , 0.05 for all comparisons.
RESULTS
Amino acids in the blood
The amino acids that are highly enriched in collagen (glycine,
proline, hydroxyproline, and hydroxylysine) increased in a
dose-dependent manner peaking 1 h after subjects injested the

 supplement (Figure 2). Amino acids that had lower enrich-
ment, such as lysine, peaked at 30 min. The greatest change in
amino acid concentrations was detected for glycine and proline
in the 15-g treatment group, peaking 376 and 162 mmol/L
higher than baseline at the 0-h time point, respectively (Figure
2A, B). The minor amino acid components of collagen, hy-
droxyproline and hydroxylysine, showed a significant treat-
ment effect increasing from almost undetectable at rest to 105
and 19 mmol/L, respectively, in the 15-g gelatin group (Figure
2C, E). In contrast to the amino acids enriched in collagen, the
branched-chain amino acid leucine content in the serum sig-
nificantly decreased over time (Figure 2F) with no differences
between treatment groups.
Collagen content in engineered ligaments treated with
serum after gelatin supplementation
To determine whether consuming gelatin could affect collagen
synthesis, we treated engineered ligaments with PRE or the
serum isolated from blood collected 1 h after placebo or 5 or 15 g
gelatin supplementation. After 6 d of treatment, ligaments
engineered with increasing doses of gelatin showed a corre-
sponding increase in collagen content (Figure 3A) and the
collagen percent of dry mass (Figure 3B) without a change in
engineered tissue CSA, meaning that the packing density of
collagen within this developmental tissue model increased. This
indicates that the serum from the subjects who had previously
consumed increasing amounts of gelatin supported more colla-
gen synthesis and that this effect was dependent on the amount
of gelatin within the supplement.
Mechanics of engineered ligaments treated with serum
after gelatin supplementation
To determine the functional effect of the increase in collagen as
a result of treatment with serum from subjects who had consumed
gelatin, the engineered ligaments were mechanically tested to
failure. None of the sera altered the CSA of the ligaments (Figure
4A). However, the MTL of the ligaments significantly increased
for all treatment groups (P , 0.05) (Figure 4B). Because there
was an increase in MTL with no change in CSA, the result is
that the material properties of modulus (Figure 4C) and ultimate
tensile strength (Figure 4D) also significantly increased (P , 0.05)
as a result of the supplementation.
Effects of gelatin supplementation on collagen synthesis in
vivo
With the beneficial effects of gelatin supplementation in
vitro, we next performed a human study using a serum marker
of collagen synthesis during a 72-h supplementation and ex-
ercise program. For all 3 treatment groups, PINP concentra-
tions at baseline were 27.9 6 4 ng/mL. The repeated bouts of
6 min of rope-skipping interspaced with $6 h of rest resulted
in an increase in the amount of the amino-terminal propeptide
of collagen I in the placebo (53.9%) and 5-g gelatin (59.2%)
groups (Figure 5A). In the 15g gelatin treatment group,
there was a further significant increase (153%) in PINP at 4 h
(P , 0.05; Figure 5A). The doubling of PINP concentrations
at 4 h was maintained throughout the whole 72 h of treat-
ment. Supplementing with 15 g gelatin resulted in a doubling
of the AUC for PINP compared with time (Figure 5B).

 DISCUSSION
The current study demonstrates for the first time that con-
suming a gelatin and vitamin C–rich supplement increases the
appearance of the amino acid components of collagen within
human serum. The enrichment of the serum with these com-
ponents 1 h after consuming the gelatin supplement was suffi-
cient to increase the collagen content and mechanical properties
of engineered ligaments. Further, subjects who consumed high
amounts of gelatin 1 h before rope-skipping for 6 min showed
twice as much collagen synthesis as either the placebo or the
low-gelatin groups.
Supplementation with gelatin has previously been shown to
improve connective tissue structure and function. McAlindon
and colleagues (31) showed that consuming 10 g collagen
hydrolysate/d resulted in an increase in collagen within the knee. In
agreement with this finding, a 24-wk randomized clinical trial in
athletes showed that collagen hydrolysate significantly decreased
knee pain (32). Mouse studies that used 14C-labeled gelatin hy-
drolysate (33) further demonstrated that, although tracer from
proline could be incorporated into skin collagen at the same rate
as tracer from gelatin, tracer from the gelatin was incorporated
into the collagen of cartilage and muscle twice as much as tracer
from proline (33). These data suggest that musculoskeletal
collagen synthesis is greater in response to gelatin than to in-
dividual amino acids. Here, we show that after ingestion of
gelatin in humans, glycine, proline, hydroxyproline, and hy-
droxylysine peak in the blood after 1 h. In contrast, amino
acids in lower enrichment (lysine) or consuming less gelatin
resulted in peak levels 30 min after ingesting the supplement. Our
data are in agreement with previous work that showed the peak of

 hydroxyproline in the blood occurred later as the dose of gelatin
increased (34). This suggests that the amino acid absorption had
peaked at 1 h in the 15-g group and that the exercise should have
been performed 30 min after the supplement in the 5-g group.
The current data strongly support the hypothesis that starting
an exercise bout 1 h after consuming 15 g gelatin results in greater
collagen synthesis in the recovery period after exercise. This is
most evident in comparing the PINP concentrations 4 h after
exercise in the placebo and 15-g gelatin groups. The data clearly
show that gelatin supported collagen synthesis after exercise
(Figure 5A, B). Although exercise is known to increase collagen
synthesis and the production of PINP in tendons (6–8), it is
highly unlikely that the increase in PINP in the blood is due to
collagen synthesis in tendon, ligaments, or cartilage. Instead,
PINP in the blood is generally used as a marker of bone me-
tabolism because of its higher turnover rate (35, 36). Bone, like
tendon, responds to short periods of exercise separated by .6 h
of rest (27, 37). Therefore, it is not surprising that short periods
of high-impact exercise increased bone collagen synthesis.
However, this is the first work that we are aware of that shows
that the mechanical increase in bone collagen synthesis could be
supported by a nutritional intervention.
Although the in vivo work likely reflects bone collagen syn-
thesis, using an engineered ligament model, we have demon-
strated that a similar response is seen in tendons and ligaments treated
with serum after supplementation with gelatin. This system has
previously been used to model the effect of hormonal changes as
a result of the menstrual cycle (26) or heavy resistance exercise
(28). In the current study, the experimental media used serum
isolated from the same subject at baseline and 1 h after con-
suming the placebo or 5 or 15 g gelatin supplement. In the
presence of serum isolated from the 5- and 15-g of gelatin groups,
we observed a stepwise increase in the collagen content of the
ligaments. This suggests that the increasing amino acids or an-
other factor that is released into the serum as a result of gelatin
ingestion improves collagen synthesis. Because normal DMEM
contains supraphysiological levels of many amino acids, the
observed effect is likely because of proline, hydroxyproline, or
hydroxylysine, which are not components of DMEM. Proline
from the serum would have increased the concentration of
proline in the feed media from 29 (baseline) to 45 mmol/L (1 h in the
15-g gelatin group), a 60% increase. We have previously shown
that the addition of 50 mmol/L proline to feed media can pro-
duce a significant increase in collagen content in engineered
ligaments (21). Similarly, hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine
increased $8-fold in the feed media: from 11.5 6 3.55 and
1.2 6 0.82 mM, respectively, at baseline (PRE) to 103 6 13.75
and 20 6 1.15 mM, respectively, in the 15-g gelatin group at 1 h.
Small peptides that contain these trace amino acids can be ab-
sorbed into the blood after ingestion of gelatin (38) and may act to
directly stimulate fibroblast activity (39). However, because
growth factors in the peritendinous fluid are w100-fold lower
than in the serum (40), how many of these amino acids in the
serum would reach a tendon is unclear.
A second interesting finding was that the engineered ligaments
showed an increase in mechanics in all of the supplement groups,
although the collagen content of the constructs only increased in
the gelatin supplemented groups. The Ribena drink used in this
study was selected because it is naturally enriched with vitamin C
(48.5 mg in the 80 mL given here). Although we did not measure
vitamin C concentrations in the serum, it is possible that this
component of the supplement had a positive effect on engineered
ligament mechanics. Vitamin C is required for collagen synthesis
(41). What is less appreciated is that vitamin C can also activate
the collagen crosslinking enzymes lysyl oxidase (42) and the
prolyl and lysyl hydroxylases (41, 43), and this increases collagen
crosslinking (44). An increase in crosslinking within the collagen
matrix would result in an increase in mechanical properties
without an increase in collagen content consistent with the data
presented here.
Finally, although the focus of the manuscript has been on the
nutritional intervention, the exercise intervention was effective at
increasing collagen synthesis on its own. We have previously
shown that an intermittent training stimulus consisting of 10 min
of activity followed by 6 h of rest resulted in greater collagen
synthesis than continuous activity in engineered ligaments (27).
For bone, as few as 40 loads/d delivered in short bouts with 6–8 h
of rest maximizes mineralization in rodents (37, 45–50). In
humans, as few as 10 maximal vertical jumps/d performed 3 d/wk
is enough to increase bone mineral density in female college
students (51). This suggests that musculoskeletal tissues, such as
tendon, ligament, cartilage, and bone, get a maximal stimulus for
collagen synthesis from short periods of activity with long in-
tervening rest periods.
In summary, this report demonstrates, for the first time to our
knowledge, that supplementation with gelatin in humans aug-
ments collagen synthesis after exercise. The accelerated rate of
collagen synthesis was observed as early as 4 h after the first bout

72 h of the study. These data suggest that adding gelatin and

a beneficial role in injury prevention and tissue repair.
