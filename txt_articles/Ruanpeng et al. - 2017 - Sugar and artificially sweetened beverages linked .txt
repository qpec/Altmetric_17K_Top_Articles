Summary
Background/Objectives: Artificial sweeteners are used widely to replace caloric sugar as one of the strategies to lessen cal-
oric intake. However, the association between the risk of obesity and artificially sweetened soda consumption is controver-
sial. The objective of this meta-analysis aimed to assess the association between consumption of sugar and artificially
sweetened soda and obesity.
Methods: A literature search was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception through May 2015. Studies that reported relative risks, odd
ratios, or hazard ratios comparing the risk of obesity in patients consuming either sugar or artificially sweetened soda vs.
those who did not consume soda were included. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CI were calculated using a random-effect,
generic inverse variance method.
Results: Eleven studies were included in our analysis to assess the association between consumption of sugar-sweetened
soda and obesity. The pooled RR of obesity in patients consuming sugar-sweetened soda was 1.18 (95% CI, 1.10–1.27). Three
studies were included to assess the association between consumption of artificially sweetened soda and obesity. The pooled
RR of obesity in patients consuming artificially sweetened soda was 1.59 (95% CI, 1.22–2.08).
Conclusions: Our study demonstrated a significant association between sugar and artificially sweetened soda consumption
and obesity. This finding raises awareness and question of negative clinical impact on both sugar and artificially sweetened
soda and the risk of obesity.
Introduction
Obesity prevalence has significantly risen in the USA and world-
wide. Globally, the prevalence of obesity and overweight com-
bined increased by 27% in adult and 47% in children from 1980
to 2013.1 Specifically, in the USA, �37% of adult and 17% of chil-
dren were affected by obesity based on National Health and
Examination Survey (NHANES).2,3 Because of the obesity epi-
demic and substantial increasing trend in obesity and its

 comorbidities particularly non-communicable diseases, govern-
ment in many countries has responded by increasing public
health awareness and implementing policy and regulation.
Sugar-sweetened beverages largely contribute as one of a
source of additional calories in daily diet consumed by US popu-
lation. Previous evidences demonstrated inconsistent and mix
results on an association between the risk of obesity and higher
consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages although some
studies revealed a modest relationship.4–6 The strength of asso-
ciation was inconclusive because of the heterogeneity and the
type of studies conducted made an evaluation of sugar-
sweetened beverages and obesity risk still unclear.4–6
Artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose and sac-
charine are commonly used as an alternative to lower calories
in many types of beverages including soft drink, fruit juice and
energy drink as presumably healthier choices. Therefore, it may
seem logical that artificial sweeteners would have provided less
weight gain, and prevented cardiometabolic risks. With this re-
gard, the numbers of people in the USA who consumed artifi-
cially sweetened beverages have substantially risen with 24% of
adult and 12% of children reported consuming low caloric
sweetened beverages based on 2007–08 NHANES data.7 Several
studies have suggested that artificially sweetened beverages
might not provide health benefit as one might expect. Greater
risk of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes were reported
across various large prospective cohorts.8,9 Nevertheless, previ-
ous reports on artificially sweetened beverages on obesity and
weight gain are conflicting.
The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis
was to assess the association between obesity and the con-
sumption of sugar and artificially sweetened beverages.
Research design and methods
Search strategy
Two investigators (C.T. and W.C.) independently searched pub-
lished studies indexed in MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane
databases from inception through May 2015 using the search
strategy described in item Supplementary material S1. A man-
ual search for supplementary relevant studies utilizing refer-
ences from retrieved articles was also completed. In order to
assess the quality and publication bias of all studies, conference
abstracts and unpublished studies were excluded. This system-
atic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA
(Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analysis) guidelines.10 PRISMA checklist is shown in online
Supplementary material S2.
Study selection
The inclusion criteria were (i) randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) or observational studies (case-control, cohort studies or
cross-sectional) published as original studies to appraise the
risk of obesity in patients consuming either sugar or artificially
sweetened soda, (ii) odds ratios, relative risks, hazard ratios or
standardized incidence ratio with 95% CIs were presented and
(iii) a reference group composed of participants who did not
consume soda. No limits were implemented to language.
Study eligibility was independently ascertained by the two
investigators noted earlier. Differing decisions were settled by
common consensus. The quality of each included study was in-
dependently
assessed
by
individual
investigator
using
Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale.11
Data collection process and data items
A standardized information collection form was utilized to ob-
tain the following information: last name of the first author,
type of study, country of origin, year of publication, sample size,
characteristics of included participants, definition of soda con-
sumption, definition used to diagnose obesity including body
mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), confounder adjust-
ment and adjusted effect estimates with 95% CI. The two inves-
tigators mentioned earlier independently performed this data
extraction.
Statistical analysis
All data analyses were performed using Review Manager 5.3
software from the Cochrane Collaboration. Point estimates and
standard errors were derived from individual studies and were
consolidated by the generic inverse variance approach of
DerSimonian
and
Laird.12
Due
to
the
high
likelihood
of
between-study variances, we applied a random-effect model ra-
ther than a fixed-effect model. Statistical heterogeneity was as-
sessed
using
the
Cochran’s
Q
test.
This
statistic
is
complemented with the I2 statistic, which quantifies the pro-
portion of the total variation across included studies that are
due to heterogeneity rather than chance. A value of I2 of 0–25%
represents insignificant heterogeneity, 26–50% low heterogen-
eity, 51–75% moderate heterogeneity and >75% high heterogen-
eity.13 The presence of publication bias was assessed by funnel
plots of the logarithm of odds ratios vs. their standard errors.14
Results
Our search strategy yielded 3478 potentially relevant articles. A
total of 3219 articles were excluded based on title and abstract for
not fulfilling inclusion criteria by the type of article, study design,
population or outcome of interest. A total of 259 articles under-
went full-length article review, and 246 articles were excluded
(133 articles were not observational studies or RCTs, 113 articles
did not report the outcomes of interest). We identified 13 articles
included in the data analysis, 11 studies for the association be-
tween obesity and sugar-sweetened soda and 3 studies for the as-
sociation between obesity and artificially sweetened soda. Item
S2 in Supplementary material S1 outlined our search method-
ology and selection process. Table 1 showed the detailed charac-
teristics and quality assessment of the included studies.
The risk of overweight/obesity in patients consuming
sugar-sweetened soda
Eleven studies15–25 [six cohort studies15–20 and five cross-
sectional studies21–25] with 88 383 patients consuming sugar-
sweetened soda were included in the analysis for the risk of
obesity. The pooled risk ratio (RR) for overweight/obesity in indi-
viduals consuming sugar-sweetened soda was 1.18 (95% CI,
1.10–1.27). The statistical heterogeneity was low with an I2 of
40%. Figure 1 shows the forest plot of the included studies. We
performed an analysis excluding cross-sectional studies (data
not shown), and the result remained significant (RR 1.2 [95% CI,
1.08–1.32]); with moderate heterogeneity I2 of 57%.

 sugar-sweetened soda were included in the analysis for the risk
of high WC. The pooled RR for high WC in individuals consum-
ing sugar-sweetened soda was 1.20 (95% CI, 1.04–1.37). The stat-
istical heterogeneity was moderate with an I2of 52%. Figure 2

The risk of overweight/obesity in patients consuming
artificially sweetened soda
Three studies24,26,27 [all cross-sectional studies] with 12 987 pa-
tients consuming artificially sweetened soda were included in
the analysis for the risk of overweight/obesity. The pooled RR
for obesity in individuals consuming artificially sweetened soda
was 1.59 (95% CI, 1.22–2.08). The statistical heterogeneity was
low with an I2of 36%. Figure 3 shows the forest plot of the
included studies.
Evaluation of publication bias
Funnel plots to evaluate publication bias for the risk of obesity
in patients consuming sugar-sweetened soda and artificially
sweetened soda were summarized in Supplementary Figures S1
and S2. The graph provides a suggestion for insignificant publi-
cation bias of the risk of obesity in patients with sugar-
sweetened soda and artificially sweetened soda consumption.
Discussion
Our
meta-analysis
demonstrated
a
statistically
significant
association between sugar-soda consumption and weight with
1.18-fold increased the risk of overall overweight and obesity,
and
1.2-fold
increased
the
risk
of
higher
WC
compared
with those who did not consume sugar-sweetened beverages.
Interestingly, the positive association was also observed in peo-
ple who regularly consumed artificially sweetened beverages
with 1.59-fold increased the risk of overweight and obesity com-
pared with those who did not.
Our findings confirmed a greater risk of obesity linked to ex-
cessive calories intakes from sugary beverages. The risk of obes-
ity and high WC increased by 18–20% with consumption of
sugar-sweetened beverages. This strength of association was
consistent with previous meta-analysis.6 There have been sev-
eral mechanisms explained the cause of weight gain from
added sugars. Obviously, added sugars directly increased the
amount of caloric intake that exceeded energy balance.6 In add-
ition, previous studies had demonstrated a lack of compensa-
tory mechanism and less satiating effect of isoenergetic liquid
food such as sugar-sweetened beverages when compared with
solid food consumption.28,29 Thus, there was no reduction in
total or subsequent solid food intake when an individual con-
sumed more beverages resulting in greater weight gain. De
Castro demonstrated that consumption of either caloric or low
caloric beverages did not replace other forms of food in the sub-
sequent meal or over the entire day which indicated the elasti-
city of eating pattern and influence of non-regulatory factors
such as circadian, seasonal and social circumstances.29
Sugar in the form of soda and other sugary drinks such as
fruit juices are the highest source of added calories in the diet in
the USA.30 North America and Latin America are the current
largest consumers of sugar-sweetened beverages.31 However,
the trends of sugar containing beverages sale are remarkably
rising in low- and middle-income countries particularly in
China, Thailand, Brazil and Chile.31 Hence, in 2015, World
Health
Organization
recommended
decreasing
free
sugars
(added to foods and beverages by the company, cook or con-
sumer, and sugars naturally being in honey, syrups, fruit juices
and fruit juice concentrates) intake to <10% of total energy in-
take in both adults and children.31
Interestingly, our study is the first meta-analysis to demon-
strate that regular consumption of artificially sweetened soda is
significantly associated with overall increased risk of overweight
and obesity. Previous studies on the association between con-
sumption of artificially sweetened beverages and weight out-
come have provided inconsistent results particularly in adults
which are likely due to different type of studies, baseline partici-
pants’ characteristics and outcomes of interest measurement.
The plausible explanations on the effect of low- or non-caloric
sweetened beverages on weight have been widely studied. In
vitro studies showed that some of the non-caloric sweeteners
up-regulated Na/glucose cotransporter on the apical (luminal)
membrane resulting in increasing glucose transporter 2 insertion
on the basolateral membrane of the gut cell and hence, increased
glucose absorption.32 It has been demonstrated in randomized
crossover study that artificial sweeteners increase glucagon-like
peptide 1 (GLP-1) secretion by 34% after oral glucose ingestion
when compared with carbonated water,33 while another study

 showed no difference in plasma GLP-1 during intraduodenal in-
fusion of sucralose vs. saline in combination with glucose.34 It
has been proposed that increased GLP-1 secretion by artificial
sweeteners would increase insulin secretion and subsequently
lower glucose level, thus increase appetite.32
Emerging evidences in both animal and human studies have
shown that gut microbiome could be one of the potential causal
links between excessive consumption of non-caloric sweeteners
and negative health effects. Suez et al.35 extensively examined
the relationship between artificial sweeteners consumption and
gut
microbiota
mediated
metabolic
dysregulation.
When
compared
with
glucose
fed
mice,
artificial
sweeteners-
consuming mice had impaired glucose tolerance that amelio-
rated by gram positive and gram negative targeting antibiotics
administration. Examining of fecal microbiota composition,
artificial sweeteners-consuming mice exhibited alteration of
groups of bacteria by over-representation of the Bacteroides and
under-representation of the Clostridiales. Moreover, germ-free
mice recipients receiving fecal transplantation from mice drink-
ing saccharin demonstrated impaired glucose tolerance which
indicated artificial sweeteners induced poor metabolic response
through
alteration
of
gut
microbiota.
Suez
et
al.35
also
demonstrated similar effect of non-caloric artificial sweeteners
consumption in human. In a cohort of 381 non-diabetic partici-
pants, poor metabolic syndrome markers (BMI, HbA1c, glucose
tolerance test) and alteration of microbes notably for the
Enterobacteriales and the Clostridiales were positively corre-
lated in the individuals consuming artificial sweeteners. In a
smaller human study, after 1 week of exposure to maximal ac-
ceptable daily intake of saccharin, four out of seven healthy vol-
unteers who do not normally consume artificially sweetened
beverages developed poor glycemic responses and altered gut
microbiome composition while there was no response in the re-
maining individuals. Interestingly, microbiome compositions
appear to be different even prior to exposure to saccharin in
participants who had worsen metabolic response compared
with participants who did not which indicated distinct nutri-
tional individual responses in human.35
Although most of the included studies are of moderate to
high quality as evaluated by Newcastle-Ottawa scale, there are
some of limitations to note. Our meta-analysis included the
studies involving only adult so the result does not reflect child-
hood obesity. A majority of the studies were conducted using
diet recall questionnaire that provided less accurate data and
lack of repeated assessments of diet intake or adjusted for other
dietary component could possibly cause dietary misclassifica-
tion and lead to reporting bias. Additionally, there is heterogen-
eity of the analysis including type of artificial sweeteners
consumption, outcomes of interest (BMI, and WC), and differ-
ence in adjusted confounders. Although sample sizes were rela-
tively large, a few studies of artificially sweetened beverages
were included in our meta-analysis due to inclusion criteria so
it might lead to publication bias. The studies included in this
meta-analysis are observational studies either cohort or cross-
sectional thus, the result can be drawn only by association but
not causal relationships.
In summary, our study demonstrated significant links be-
tween both sugar and artificially sweetened soda and obesity.
This finding should raise public awareness and governmental
responses for policy and regulation on potential negative health
impacts particularly weight and metabolic dysregulation on ex-
cessive consumption of sugar and artificially sweetened bever-
ages.
A
prospective
well-designed
interventional
study
is
warranted to better understand causal mechanisms and lead to
nutritional guidances.
