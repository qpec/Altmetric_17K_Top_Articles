BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In the primary care setting, there are racial and ethnic differences 
in antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs). Viral ARTIs are 
commonly diagnosed in the pediatric emergency department (PED), in which racial and 
ethnic differences in antibiotic prescribing have not been previously reported. We sought to 
investigate whether patient race and ethnicity was associated with differences in antibiotic 
prescribing for viral ARTIs in the PED.
METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of encounters at 7 PEDs in 2013, in which we 
used electronic health data from the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network 
Registry. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the association between 
patient race and ethnicity and antibiotics administered or prescribed among children 
discharged from the hospital with viral ARTI. Children with bacterial codiagnoses, chronic 
disease, or who were immunocompromised were excluded. Covariates included age, 
sex, insurance, triage level, provider type, emergency department type, and emergency 
department site.
RESULTS: Of 39 445 PED encounters for viral ARTIs that met inclusion criteria, 2.6% (95% 
confidence interval [CI] 2.4%–2.8%) received antibiotics, including 4.3% of non-Hispanic 
(NH) white, 1.9% of NH black, 2.6% of Hispanic, and 2.9% of other NH children. In 
multivariable analyses, NH black (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.44; CI 0.36–0.53), Hispanic 
(aOR 0.65; CI 0.53–0.81), and other NH (aOR 0.68; CI 0.52–0.87) children remained less 
likely to receive antibiotics for viral ARTIs.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with NH white children, NH black and Hispanic children were less 
likely to receive antibiotics for viral ARTIs in the PED. Future research should seek to 
understand why racial and ethnic differences in overprescribing exist, including parental 
expectations, provider perceptions of parental expectations, and implicit provider bias.

What’s KnoWn on this subject: Viral acute respiratory tract infections 
(ARTIs) are commonly diagnosed in children. Racial and ethnic differences in the 
use of antibiotics for treatment of viral ARTIs have been observed in the primary 
care setting but have not been reported in the emergency department.
What this study adds: Although overall use of antibiotics for the treatment 
of viral ARTIs was low, racial and ethnic differences in antibiotic prescribing 
were demonstrated. Compared with non-Hispanic white children, non-
Hispanic black and Hispanic children were less likely to receive antibiotics 
for viral ARTIs.

 Acute respiratory tract infections 
(ARTIs) are among the most common 
reasons for children receiving 
emergency department (ED) care.1, 
 
2  
The majority of respiratory tract 
infections in children are viral 
and do not warrant treatment 
with antibiotics. Nevertheless, 
antibiotic misuse for viral upper 
respiratory tract infections has 
been well documented, with rates of 
overuse as high as 13% to 75%.3 
– 
6 
Inappropriate use of antibiotics leads 
to an increased risk of unnecessary 
adverse drug effects and contributes 
to the development of antibiotic-
resistant bacteria.7 
– 
11
A recent study revealed racial and 
ethnic differences in antibiotic 
prescribing for pediatric ARTIs in 
non-ED settings across a pediatric 
primary care network, with black 
children receiving fewer antibiotics 
than non-black children.12 Racial 
and ethnic differences in pediatric 
emergency care have been described 
in computed tomography (CT) 
utilization for minor head trauma, 
13  
performance of laboratory and 
radiologic testing, 
14 hospital 
admission rates, 
15 and pain 
management in children diagnosed 
with appendicitis16 but have not 
previously been explored for 
antibiotic prescribing. Therefore, our 
goal in this study was to investigate 
whether patient race and ethnicity 
was associated with antibiotic 
prescribing for viral infections in the 
pediatric emergency department 
(PED). We hypothesized that non-
Hispanic (NH) white children with 
viral ARTIs receive antibiotics at 
higher rates than Hispanic or NH 
black patients.
Methods
study design
We performed a retrospective 
cohort study by using the Pediatric 
Emergency Care Applied Research 
Network (PECARN) Registry17, 
 
18  
from January 1, 2013, through 
December 31, 2013. This study was 
approved by the institutional review 
boards of all study sites and the data 
coordinating center.
data source and study Population
The PECARN Registry is a 
deidentified electronic health 
registry of all encounters at 7 PEDs.17 
Through automated processes, the 
Registry captures visit data from 
the sites directly from the electronic 
health record. The sites included 
are geographically diverse and are 
composed of 4 large tertiary care 
children’s hospital health systems 
with 4 PEDs and 3 affiliated satellite 
PEDs. The patient populations of 
the ED sites contributing to the 
PECARN Registry are racially and 
ethnically diverse, with among-
site variation in the racial and 
ethnic composition of the patient 
populations (Supplemental Table 
4). Sites are labeled as A through 
G in the results and tables sections 
and scrambled as 1 to 7 in the 
Supplemental Information to 
preserve confidentiality and prevent 
unblinding of sites.
The eligible study population 
included all patients ≤18 years of age 
who were discharged from the ED 
with an International Classification  
of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9)  
diagnosis code for viral ARTIs 
(Supplemental Table 5). We excluded 
patient encounters with additional 
ICD-9 diagnosis codes for bacterial 
infections (Supplemental Table 5) or 
chronic care conditions.19 Because 
ICD-9 diagnosis codes for pharyngitis 
are nonspecific, visits with a 
pharyngitis code (Supplemental 
Table 5) were excluded if a rapid 
strep test result was positive for 
group A β-hemolytic Streptococcus.
outcome
The primary outcome measure was 
oral, intravenous, or intramuscular 
antibiotic administration in the ED 
or prescription on ED discharge. 
Visits were categorized as “antibiotic 
provision” if at least 1 antibiotic 
administration or prescription was 
associated with the ED visit.
exposure
The primary exposure was patient 
race and ethnicity. Consistent with 
other racial disparities studies, 
20  
the race and ethnicity variable 
was created by collapsing race and 
ethnicity (which were 2 discrete 
variables in the PECARN Registry) 
into 1 race and ethnicity variable. 
Race and ethnicity were categorized 
as NH black, NH white, Hispanic, and 
other.
Potential confounding variables 
included patient demographics 
(eg, age, sex, insurance status, 
and triage acuity level) and ED 
visit demographics (ED site, ED 
type, ED provider, and provider 
type). Patient age was analyzed as 
a categorical variable (0–1, 2–4, 
5–9, and 10–18 years). Insurance 
status was categorized as private, 
government (eg, Medicaid, Medicare), 
self-pay, or other. Triage level was 
categorized by using the 5-level 
Emergency Severity Index.21 ED 
type was categorized as main PED or 
satellite ED. Provider type of record 
(ie, the most senior clinician) was 
categorized as pediatric emergency 
medicine (PEM) physician (eg, 
board certified or board eligible in 
PEM), general pediatrician, general 
emergency medicine physician 
(board certified or board eligible 
in general emergency medicine), 
PEM fellow, physician assistant or 
nurse practitioner, or other. If ED 
visits had multiple provider types 
due to transfer of care, those visits 
were excluded from multivariable 
logistic regression modeling because 
provider type could not be assigned 
but were included in all other 
analyses.
statistical analysis
We used standard measures to 
describe our study population and 
calculate rates of antibiotic provision

 by race and ethnicity. We used 
bivariable and multivariable logistic 
regression to develop unadjusted 
and adjusted odds ratios (aORs), 
respectively, to measure the strength 
of association of race and ethnicity 
with antibiotic use. To provide 
a conservative consideration of 
all potentially related variables, 
confounding and covariables with 
a P value < .2 in bivariable analysis 
were included in our multivariable 
model. We adjusted for clustering by 
clinician by using a random effects 
model with a random intercept 
for clinician. We also explored the 
interaction of race and ethnicity 
with sites that served a higher 
proportion of NH white children in 
the multivariable model to assess 
whether distribution of race and 
ethnicity modifies the estimated 
differences in antibiotic use. For this 
analysis, sites were dichotomized 
as to whether >30% of the pediatric 
population seeking care was of NH 
white race and ethnicity. To evaluate 
the effect of clustering by patient, we 
also performed a sensitivity analysis 
including only the first eligible visit 
for each patient. All analyses were 
conducted by using SAS version 9.4 
(SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
Results
During the study period, there were 
413 954 ED visits, of which there were 
39 445 (9.5%) ED visits by children 
diagnosed with a viral ARTI who met 
the inclusion criteria (Fig 1). The mean 
age was 3.3 years, and half of the study 
population was NH black (Table 1). 
The racial and ethnic composition 
across sites ranged from an NH black 
proportion of 0.7% to 97.0% and a 
Hispanic proportion of 2.0% to 45.5% 
(Supplemental Table 5).
Overall, 2.6% (95% confidence 
interval [CI] 2.4–2.8) of children 
received antibiotics for viral ARTIs. 
This differed by race and ethnicity, 
with 4.3% of NH white patients 
receiving antibiotics compared with 
1.9% of NH black, 2.6% of Hispanic, 
and 2.9% of other NH patients (Fig 2). 
Compared with NH white children, 
NH black (odds ratio [OR] 0.41; CI 
0.35–0.49), Hispanic (OR 0.57; CI 
0.47–0.69), and other NH children (OR 
0.64; CI 0.50–0.82) were less likely to 
receive antibiotics (Table 2).
In a multivariable analysis adjusting 
for age, insurance status, triage acuity 
level, ED provider type, and ED site, 
NH black (aOR 0.44; CI 0.36–0.53), 
Hispanic (aOR 0.65; CI 0.53–0.81), 
and other NH (aOR 0.68; CI 0.52–0.87) 
patients remained less likely to 
receive antibiotics when diagnosed 
with viral ARTIs in the ED (Table 2).  
Within-site analyses to check for 
consistency of the relationship 
between race and ethnicity and 
antibiotic provision across sites 
demonstrated generally consistent 
results (Table 3). When an interaction

 term of race and ethnicity with sites 
that serve a large proportion of care 
to NH white children was added 
to the multivariable model, racial 
and ethnic differences in antibiotic 
use attenuated at sites that serve a 
large proportion of care to NH white 
children (interaction P value < .01) but 
still persisted. A sensitivity analysis 
excluding 5005 (12.7%) repeat visits 
for patients with >1 qualifying visit 
yielded similar results with respect 
to racial and ethnic differences in 
antibiotic administration.
discussion
These results confirm our hypothesis 
that NH white children are more 
likely to receive unnecessary 
antibiotics for viral respiratory 
infections than their minority 
counterparts. Of the 2.6% of 
children diagnosed exclusively with 
viral infections and treated with 
antibiotics, NH white children with 
viral diagnoses had 1.5 to 2 times 
higher odds of being treated with 
antibiotics than Hispanic and NH 
black children, respectively. These 
differences persisted within and 
across sites and also among sites that 
treated relatively higher proportions 
of NH white children. These data 
extend previously reported racial 
differences in the management of 
ARTIs12 to the PED.
Antibiotic overuse is a public 
health concern.22 ARTIs are among 
the most common reasons that 
parents seek medical care for their 
children, 
23, 
 
24 and ARTIs account 
for ∼75% of antibiotic prescribing 
to children despite the majority of 
these infections being caused by 
viruses.25 Because both the frequency 
and duration of previous antibiotic 
exposure have been implicated in the 
spread of drug-resistant community 
pathogens, 
7 and because children 
receive a significant proportion 
of total antibiotic consumption, 
26 
decreasing unnecessary antibiotic 
use in pediatric populations is a 
particularly important target from a 
public health perspective.27 
– 
29
We found lower rates of antibiotic 
prescribing for viral ARTIs in 
children than cited in previous 
studies, in which rates were as high 
as 13% to 75%.3, 
 
5 One explanation 
for this could be that the majority of 
the clinicians caring for children in 
our study work in pediatric settings. 
Pediatricians have lower rates of 
antibiotic use for the treatment of 
viral ARTIs compared with other 
specialties.3, 
 
30, 
31 Furthermore, the 
EDs represented in our study are 
all affiliated with large academic 
centers, and there are lower rates of 
antibiotic prescription for viral ARTIs 
in teaching hospitals.5 Additionally, 
it is possible that PEDs have more 
precise diagnosis coding than studies 
of claims data or other large national 
data sets that may be subject to 
incomplete data abstraction. The 
relatively low rates of antibiotic 
use for viral ARTIs observed in our 
study, however, do not diminish the 
importance of the marked racial 
and ethnic differences in antibiotic 
prescribing. At a national level, there

 are more than 70 000 prescriptions 
for antibiotics for those diagnosed 
with viral ARTIs in EDs annually.32
Our results are consistent with a 
growing body of evidence from 
researchers demonstrating that 
NH white children are more likely 
to receive unnecessary medical 
assessments and interventions 
in PEDs. We found that minority 
children received more evidence-
based care with respect to 
management of their viral ARTIs, 
because antibiotics are not warranted 
for treatment. This phenomenon of 
deviations from evidence-based care 
for NH white children has  
been observed in other studies as  
well.13, 
 
30, 
 
33, 
 
34 On finding racial and  
ethnic differences in severity-adjusted 
hospital admission rates for children 
seeking emergency care, Chamberlain 
et al15 commented that their findings 
are more consistent with a practice 
of overadmitting white patients 
who were less severely ill than 
underadmitting black and Hispanic 
patients who were more severely 
ill. Similarly, Natale et al13 found 
higher rates of head CT for whites 
in less severely injured groups, in 
which CT scan use is discretionary 
or not recommended. There were no 
differences in the severely injured 
group. They noted that physicians 
more frequently cited parental 
anxiety or request as the most 
important indication influencing 
their decision to obtain head CTs 
when caring for white children than 
when caring for minority children.13
Although it was beyond the scope 
of this study to examine reasons 
for racial and ethnic differences 
in antibiotic prescribing, potential 
reasons may include race- and 
ethnicity-specific differences in 
parental expectations, differential 
parental pressures perceived 
by clinicians for treatment of 
viral infections with antibiotics, 
and implicit bias of clinicians. 
Researchers for a previous study 
indicated that when compared with 
white parents, Hispanic and black 
parents were more likely to believe 
antibiotics had a role in the treatment 
of colds and flu-like illnesses.35 
However, Mangione-Smith et al36 
demonstrated that physicians may 
underestimate the expectations for 
antibiotics among minority parents. 
Furthermore, in yet another study, 
Mangione-Smith et al37 revealed that 
although physicians’ perceptions 
of parental expectations for 
antimicrobial agents was the only 
significant predictor of prescribing 
antimicrobial agents for conditions of 
presumed viral etiology, physicians’ 
perceptions were not associated 
with actual parental expectations for 
antibiotics. Implicit bias of clinicians 
may also affect quality of delivered 
care. For instance, researchers for 1 
study noted that in comparison with 
white patients, parents of minority 
children rated lower levels of 
satisfaction with respect to clinician

another study demonstrated that 
as clinicians showed higher implicit 
preferences for white patients,

generally favor white children over 
minority children, 
12, 
 
13, 
 
15 our findings 
may be due to a caregiver’s or a 
provider’s perception that “more 
is better, 
” whether the “more” is 
clinically indicated.15
There are some potential limitations 
to this study. First, these study results 
may not be generalizable to all PEDs 
or general EDs. However, this Registry 
included all visit data from 7 different 
PEDs, including academic and satellite 
sites with over 400 000 pediatric 
visits, of which over 38 000 were 
included in our analysis. Furthermore, 
racial and ethnic composition of 
patients included in these analyses 
varied by site. To address this, in 
addition to conducting analyses 
across sites, we also conducted 
within-site analyses that revealed 
consistent results. Second, visit 
diagnoses may have been inaccurately 
coded and antibiotic use may have 
been justified if secondary, noncoded 
bacterial diagnoses were targeted. 
Such misclassification, however, 
would generally bias the observed 
results toward the null unless coding 
errors were systematically different 
on the basis of patient race and 
ethnicity. Third, our study design did 
not allow us to explore the impact of 
health literacy and income level on 
differences in antibiotic provision.
conclusions
We observed differential antibiotic 
prescribing for children presenting 
to the ED with viral ARTIs by 
patient race and ethnicity. Further 
investigation into the drivers of these 
racial and ethnic differences is critical 
to help inform interventions to 
reduce racial and ethnic differences 
in health care provision and achieve 
health equity.
