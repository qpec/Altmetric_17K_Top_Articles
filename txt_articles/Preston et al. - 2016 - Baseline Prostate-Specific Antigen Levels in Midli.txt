Purpose
Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level in midlife predicted future prostate cancer (PCa) mortality in an
unscreened Swedish population. Our purpose was to determine if a baseline PSA level during
midlife predicts lethal PCa in a US population with opportunistic screening.
Materials and Methods
We conducted a nested case-control study among men age 40 to 59 years who gave blood before
random assignment in the Physicians’ Health Study, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of aspirin
and b-carotene among 22,071 US male physicians initiated in 1982 and then transitioned into
a prospective cohort with 30 years of follow-up. Baseline PSA levels were available for 234 patients
with PCa and 711 age-matched controls. Seventy-one participants who developed lethal PCa were
rematched to 213 controls. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios and the
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, with 95% CIs, of the association between
baseline PSA and risk of lethal PCa.
Results
Median PSA among controls was 0.68, 0.88, and 0.96 ng/mL for men age 40 to 49, 50 to 54, and 55
to 59 years, respectively. Risk of lethal PCa was strongly associated with baseline PSA in midlife:
odds ratios (95% CIs) comparing PSA in the . 90th percentile versus less than or equal to median
were 8.7 (1.0 to 78.2) at 40 to 49 years, 12.6 (1.4 to 110.4) at 50 to 54 years, and 6.9 (2.5 to 19.1) at 55
to 59 years. A total of 82%, 71%, and 86% of lethal cases occurred in men with PSA above the
median at ages 40 to 49, 50 to 54, and 55 to 59 years, respectively.
Conclusion
PSA levels in midlife strongly predict future lethal PCa in a US cohort subject to opportunistic screening.
Risk-stratified screening on the basis of midlife PSA should be considered in men age 45 to 59 years.

INTRODUCTION
Prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening has been
shown to reduce prostate cancer (PCa) metastases
and mortality.1-4 However, PSA screening is as-
sociated with overdiagnosis and overtreatment,
and it is controversial whether it does more good
than harm.5,6 Smarter screening strategies are
needed to improve the accuracy of diagnosing
lethal PCa while minimizing harms associated
with overdiagnosis and overtreatment of indolent
cancer.
One proposed strategy with potential for
minimizing harm while maintaining benefit is
performing a baseline PSA screening in men
during midlife.7-16 Because prostate carcinogen-
esis likely initiates in men during their fourth and
fifth decade, the baseline PSA level at a younger
age may be more accurate in predicting the presence
of aggressive PCa, because it will be less confounded
by benign prostate hyperplasia typical in older men.17
Autopsy studies show that approximately 22% of
white men harbor PCa by age 60 years.18 Baseline
PSAvalues seem to confer better predictive ability for
future development of advanced PCa than do risk
categories such as African American race or family
history of PCa.15,19 Studies of Swedish men dem-
onstrated that PSA level in midlife predicts for future
PCa diagnosis and metastases in unscreened pop-
ulations during a median 27 years of follow-up.10,11

 Our objective was to determine if baseline PSA level in midlife
could predict future risk of lethal PCa in a population of US men,
subject to opportunistic screening, with 30 years of follow-up. We
hypothesized that men with a PSA level above the median in
midlife will be more likely to develop lethal PCa.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Selection and Description of Participants
The Physicians’ Health Study (PHS) was a randomized, placebo-
controlled trial of aspirin and b-carotene among 22,071 US male physi-
cians initiated in 1982.20 From 1982 to 1984, 14,916 participants (68%) age
40 to 84 years provided a blood specimen before random assignment, and
these men provide the study base for the current project. All arms of the
trial have ended, and participants continue to be followed as an obser-
vational cohort. The PHS was approved by the Partners HealthCare In-
stitutional Review Board.
Technical Information
Identification of prostate cancers and deaths. Participants reported
significant morbid events, including PCa, yearly in a mailed questionnaire
and by postcards every 6 months. Self-reported, incident PCa cases di-
agnosed from 1982 to 2012 were confirmed through medical record and
pathology report review by the PHS Endpoints Committee. Tumor clinical
stage and occurrence of metastases were ascertained from medical records
and from questionnaires sent to PCa survivors after diagnosis. Deaths were
identified via family member and postal authority report and through
periodic searches of the National Death Index. The Endpoints Committee
determined cause of death through death certificates and medical record
review and, secondarily, via next of kin.
Selection of cases and controls. We previously performed a nested
case-control study of PSA level and PCa risk among participants with
adequate plasma samples in the blood cohort.21 In that study, there were
430 cases overall diagnosed between 1982 and 1993 and 1,642 controls
among participants who had not reported a diagnosis of PCa at the time the
diagnosis was reported by the corresponding case, matched by age (6 1 year)
at blood draw. The current case-control analysis is restricted to the 234 cases
and 711 controls age 40 to 59 years at baseline. The ratio of cases to
controls was 1:3 for the majority (76%) of matched sets, 1:2 for 10%, and
1:4 for 14%.
In addition to total PCa, we studied risk of lethal PCa, defined as
death from PCa or development of metastatic disease either at diagnosis or
during follow-up. Among 234 original patients with PCa, 60 developed
lethal PCa. Among 711 men originally selected as controls, 11 developed
lethal PCa later in follow-up. Thus, there were 71 lethal cases, 65 of whom
died as a result of PCa and six of whom had metastatic disease but did not
die as a result of PCa during follow-up. The date of death was used as the
lethal event date for men who died as a result of PCa, and the date of
metastatic disease diagnosis was used for men with metastatic disease who
did not die as a result of PCa during follow-up. For this analysis, the 71
lethal cases were rematched to three controls (n = 213) on the basis of age
at blood draw (6 1 year), being alive at the time of lethal event in the
corresponding case, and having a PSA measurement at baseline. Because
our focus was lethal PCa, we did not exclude men with PCa as potential
controls for these 71 cases, as long as they had not suffered a lethal event at
the time of the event in the case. The alternative strategy (ie, limiting
controls to men without a PCa diagnosis) would have led to an over-
estimate of the association between PSA levels and risk of lethal PCa.
Total PSA assay. Details of the PSA assay conducted on stored plasma
samples have been described previously.21 Briefly, total PSA levels were
measured using the Tandem-R immunoradiometric assay (Hybritech, San
Diego, CA). Intra- and interbatch coefficients of variation were # 10%
and # 17%, respectively. Concentrations of total PSA stored in plasma
stored at 280°C for 20 years have been shown to be comparable to
concentrations in samples measured soon after blood draw.22
Imputed PSA values. To estimate the absolute risk of lethal PCa as
a function of baseline PSA, we used the nested case-control information to
impute PSA levels among the cohort of participants age 40 to 59 years who
provided a blood sample at baseline (n = 11,189) using similar meth-
odology to Vickers et al10 (Data Supplement). Using PROC MI in SAS, PSA
measurements were calculated over 10 imputations using predictive mean
matching on the basis of follow-up time and stratified by baseline age (40
to 49, 50 to 54, 55 to 59 years) and case status (lethal case, nonlethal case,
noncase) during follow-up from 1982 to 2012. Among this subcohort of
men age 40 to 59 years who provided blood samples, n = 1,701 total
incident prostate cancers were diagnosed from 1983 to 2012, including 127
lethal cases.
Statistics
Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs)
and 95% CIs for the association between baseline PSA levels and total PCa
risk, comparing cases and patients with disease overall as well as by ages 40
to 49, 50 to 54, and 55 to 59 years. We used conditional logistic regression
to assess the association between baseline PSA level and lethal PCa risk
after rematching the controls.
The 15-, 20-, 25-, and 30-year cumulative incidence (and 95%
CI) of lethal PCa according to PSA percentile was estimated within
each age group. PSA levels for the full blood cohort were imputed as
described above. The mean of the individual cumulative incidence
estimates was calculated over the 10 imputation sets, and CIs were
determined on the log-transformed scale according to Rubin’s
method.23 We averaged estimates across the 10 imputation sets to plot
the cumulative incidence of lethal PCa by age group and PSA level and
determine the proportion of lethal PCa captured by PSA categories
according to age group.
Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was
used to evaluate the discrimination of baseline PSA for predicting total
and lethal PCa using the case-control data set. All P values were two-sided
with statistical significance at P , .05. Analyses were performed using
SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and the R programming
language.
RESULTS
Descriptive statistics of the study populations are shown in Table 1.
The mean age at blood draw was 55 years. Median follow-up time
from blood draw to cancer diagnosis was 9.0 years for overall cases
and 8.6 years for lethal cases.
Median PSA levels varied by age at baseline and were higher
among older men (Table 2). Compared with men with measured
PSA at or below the age-specific median, men with PSA above the
median had consistently and significantly increased risk of total
PCa across all age groups. The ORs were 7.3 (95% CI, 2.4 to 21.8)
for 40 to 49 years, 7.6 (95% CI, 3.4 to 17.2) for 50 to 54 years, and
10.1 (95% CI, 5.2 to 19.6) for 55 to 59 years (Table 2). This was
even more pronounced for men with PSA . 90th percentile, with
ORs 32.4 (95% CI, 7.1 to 149.0), 34.6 (95% CI, 11.5 to 103.6), and
30.3 (95% CI, 13.5 to 67.7) for ages 40 to 49, 50 to 54, and 55 to 59
years, respectively.
The risk of lethal PCa was also strongly associated with PSA
levels during midlife: the ORs comparing men with the . 90th
percentile versus less than or equal to median levels of PSAwere 8.7
(95% CI, 1.0 to 78.2) for 40 to 49 years, 12.6 (95% CI, 1.4 to 110.4)
for 50 to 54 years, and 6.9 (95% CI, 2.5 to 19.1) for 55 to 59 years

 (Table 2). Of the lethal PCa events, 82%, 71%, and 86% occurred
in men with PSA above the median at ages 40 to 49, 50 to 54, and 55
to 59 years, respectively (Table 3). However, there were nine cases
of lethal PCa diagnosed among men with the lowest quartile of
baseline PSA across all age groups.
The measured and imputed PSA values for participants
who provided a blood specimen at baseline are shown in the
Data Supplement. The cumulative incidence of PCa death or
development of distant metastases by category of measured and
imputed PSA, stratified by age at PSA measurement, is pre-
sented in Table 4. For men with PSA values below median at
baseline, the absolute risk of developing lethal PCa in the next
30 years was low: 0.19% for men 40 to 44, 0.51% for men 45 to
49, 1.62% for men 50 to 54, and 0.59% for men 55 to 59 years of
age.
PSA levels in midlife predicted future risk of PCa overall as
well as risk of lethal PCa with good discrimination (Table 5). For
lethal disease using measured PSA levels, the AUC was 0.75 (95%
CI, 0.53 to 0.97) for men 40 to 49 years, 0.72 (95% CI, 0.55 to 0.89)
for men 50 to 54 years, and 0.76 (95% CI, 0.67 to 0.84) for men 55
to 59 years.
DISCUSSION
In this prospective study among US men, we found that a single
baseline PSA level measured during midlife predicted subsequent
development of lethal PCa with good accuracy over 30 years of
follow-up. Opportunistic PSA screening occurred during our
follow-up time, which spanned cases diagnosed during pre-PSA
and PSA eras. Assuming that opportunistic screening was at least
somewhat effective in reducing mortality,24 our results are likely
to underestimate the association between baseline PSA and lethal
PCa in the absence of any screening. These data identify sub-
groups of men, on the basis of their PSA levels at a given age, with
widely divergent lifetime risk of PCa death, who therefore could
benefit from screening intervals tailored to their actual magni-
tude of risk. An increased risk of lethal PCa was present for men
with PSA levels above the median and especially in men with PSA
levels above the 75th and 90th percentiles. In our data, one of
seven men with PSA . 3.0 ng/mL at 55 to 59 years and one of 12
men with PSA . 2.1 ng/mL at 50 to 54 years died as a result of
PCa within 30 years. These results support prior studies showing
value of baseline PSA conducted among unscreened men in
Sweden.10,11
These findings do not necessarily imply that prostate biopsy or
definitive treatment is immediately required in younger men with
higher PSA levels at baseline, because this could lead to over-
diagnosis, but only that they undergo more intensive PSA
screening to enable earlier identification of cancer and potential
cure while still possible. If baseline PSA is markedly elevated
(. 90th percentile) for age, cumulative incidence for lethal PCa at
30 years is substantial, with rates of 4.5%, 8.4%, and 14.1% for men
age 45 to 49, 50 to 54, and 55 to 59 years, respectively.

Preston et al
 PSA screening guidelines typically recommend screening take
place between ages 55 to 69 years, because there is no published
randomized trial of PSA screening in men younger than the age of
50 years and because incidence of PCa in younger ages is quite
low. Before age 45 years, the cumulative incidence of lethal PCa at
15 years is low, and metastatic cancer is rarely diagnosed. Our
results showed no PCa deaths within 15 years in men younger than
45 years with a PSA level below the median at baseline. These
findings may inform discussions of an appropriate age range for
screening initiation, because men younger than 45 years see little
benefit, and lethal disease is likely to be caught early enough at
a subsequent screen.
The ideal screening interval for men depending on baseline
PSA level in midlife is unknown. We found that risk of developing
lethal PCa in the next 30 years among those with baseline PSA
levels below the median was , 2% at ages 40 to 59 years. Al-
though risk was small, it remained present, and so screening
should be continued, albeit with longer intervals. It seems that
baseline PSA level below the median at age 45 years followed by
repeat measurements at 5-year intervals would capture most
lethal cases, given that the 15-year cumulative incidence for lethal
PCa at age 40 to 44 years is zero and in the 45 to 49 year age group
only 0.07%.
We investigated whether one low PSA level at age 40 to 49
years is sufficient to allow men to be exempted from further
screening. We found that compared with men having PSA levels
above the median of 0.68 ng/mL, men age 40 to 49 years with PSA
levels below the 25th percentile of 0.52 ng/mL were at a decreased
risk, albeit nonsignificant, of lethal PCa (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.04 to
3.30). However, despite this low PSA level, two men with baseline
levels below 0.52 ng/mL died as a result of PCa during follow-up.
The cumulative incidence of lethal PCa for men age 40 to 44 and 45
to 49 years with a PSA level below the 25th percentile (0.53 ng/mL)
at 30 years is 0.37% (95% CI, 0.05 to 1.70) and 0.97% (95% CI,
0.30 to 2.49), respectively. Thus, it would be prudent to conduct
another PSA test during the lifetime of men age 40 to 49 years, even
if the first measure is exceptionally low, because there still exists
a small risk of PCa death.
We then sought to determine whether it is safe to stop PSA
screening at age 60 years. We found that men age 55 to 59 years
with PSA levels below the median of 0.96 ng/mL were at low risk of
lethal PCa. The cumulative incidence of lethal PCa in this age
group was 0.59% (95% CI, 0.25 to 1.22) for PSA levels below the
median at 30 years. Fully 86% of lethal cases occur in men with PSA
above the median. This suggests white men with PSA level below
1.0 ng/mL at age 60 years might reasonably forgo further PSA
screening. This requires further study but is consistent with a study
comparing a nonscreened population (Malm¨
o) with a screened
population (G¨
oteborg screening trial) that showed no reduction in
PCa mortality, but an important increase in overdiagnosis, for
rescreening men with a PSA level , 1.0 ng/mL at age 60 years.25 In
contrast, rescreening men with PSA levels . 2.0 ng/mL at age
60 years had a large reduction in PCa mortality with minimal
overdiagnosis: only 23 men needed to be screened and six di-
agnosed to avoid one PCa death at 15 years.1,25
In our analysis of the ability of PSA at midlife to predict total
and lethal PCa, the AUCs were higher for predicting total (AUC,
0.83 for 40 to 49 years) versus lethal (AUC, 0.75 for 40 to
49 years) PCa. In contrast, in the Malm¨
o Preventive Project, the
baseline PSA values in men age , 50 years more strongly pre-
dicted
advanced
PCa
(AUC,
0.75)
compared
with
total
(AUC, 0.72) risk, likely due to the absence of routine screening
in Sweden.11 The higher discrimination of PSA for total cancer in
the current study is likely a function of verification bias. In
a screened population, men with higher PSA are more likely to be
subject to biopsy and thus have an accordingly higher risk of
diagnosis. The lower discrimination of PSA for lethal cancer is
best explained in terms of risk reduction associated with
screening: a man with a higher PSA who is destined to develop
lethal cancer may have that cancer detected early because of
opportunistic screening, leading to cure.
There are few study populations available in any country that
have access to baseline blood samples, excellent accounting of lethal
PCa outcomes, and the extensive follow-up required to investigate
this question. Furthermore, because this is a US population subject
to opportunistic PSA screening, it is generalizable to a contemporary
population. A similar case-control design was previously used
among Swedish men age 27 to 56 years with extremely low PSA
testing rates in the Malm¨
o Preventive Project.10 They found risk of
death from PCa was also strongly associated with baseline PSA: 44%
(95% CI, 34% to 53%) of deaths occurred in men with PSA
concentration in the highest 10th of the distribution of concen-
trations at age 45 to 49 years ($ 1.6 ng/mL), with a similar pro-
portion for the highest 10th at age 51 to 55 years ($ 2.4 ng/mL;
cumulative incidence, 44%; 95% CI, 32% to 56%).10
Our study is subject to limitations. Despite decades of follow-
up, we have limited lethal events, especially in younger age groups,
contributing to wider CIs. However, it is worth noting that the wide
CIs are due, in part, to the fact that PSA is so strongly related to
lethal disease risk, resulting in a small number of events in the
reference group with low PSA levels. An unknown proportion of
case-control participants might have undergone opportunistic PSA
testing before study inclusion in 1993. Even though approval of the

Baseline PSA Levels in Midlife Predict Lethal Prostate Cancer
 PSA test for the purpose of screening asymptomatic men for PCa
by the US Food and Drug Administration did not occur until 1994,
uptake in the United States was present before this, and it is es-
timated that PSA testing increased from , 5% of white men in
1989 to approximately 40% in 1994.26 The impact of this op-
portunistic screening is likely limited, because our primary study
outcome was lethal PCa and not incidence.
It is also important to note that the cumulative incidence of
PCa mortality in this study was 4.9% in 2012. This is higher than
the general population because of decreased cardiac mortality
among this physician group. Finally, the study population con-
sisted primarily of white men. Although studies have shown
midlife PSA to be predictive of PCa diagnosis in African American
men, no study has evaluated risk of PCa metastases or death,

 despite there being a greater risk of diagnosis and mortality
compared with white men.9,27,28
In conclusion, PSA levels in midlife predict strongly for
subsequent development of lethal PCa in a cohort of American
men subject to opportunistic PSA screening. Risk-stratified
screening on the basis of midlife PSA should be considered in
men age 45 to 59. Men with PSA below median at age 60 years
(, 1.0 ng/mL) are unlikely to develop lethal disease.
