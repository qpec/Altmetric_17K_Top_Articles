Stratification of women according to their risk of breast cancer based on polygenic risk scores (PRSs) could improve screening and pre-
vention strategies. Our aim was to develop PRSs, optimized for prediction of estrogen receptor (ER)-specific disease, from the largest avail-
able genome-wide association dataset and to empirically validate the PRSs in prospective studies. The development dataset comprised
94,075 case subjects and 75,017 control subjects of European ancestry from 69 studies, divided into training and validation sets. Samples
were genotyped using genome-wide arrays, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected by stepwise regression or lasso
penalized regression. The best performing PRSs were validated in an independent test set comprising 11,428 case subjects and 18,323
control subjects from 10 prospective studies and 190,040 women from UK Biobank (3,215 incident breast cancers). For the best PRSs
(313 SNPs), the odds ratio for overall disease per 1 standard deviation in ten prospective studies was 1.61 (95%CI: 1.57–1.65) with
area under receiver-operator curve (AUC) ¼ 0.630 (95%CI: 0.628–0.651). The lifetime risk of overall breast cancer in the top centile
of the PRSs was 32.6%. Compared with women in the middle quintile, those in the highest 1% of risk had 4.37- and 2.78-fold risks,
and those in the lowest 1% of risk had 0.16- and 0.27-fold risks, of developing ER-positive and ER-negative disease, respectively. Good-
ness-of-fit tests indicated that this PRS was well calibrated and predicts disease risk accurately in the tails of the distribution. This PRS is a
powerful and reliable predictor of breast cancer risk that may improve breast cancer prevention programs.
Introduction
Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed among
women in Western countries. While rare mutations in genes
such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 confer high risks of developing
breast cancer, these account for only a small proportion
of breast cancer cases in the general population. Multiple
common breast cancer susceptibility variants discovered
through genome-wide association studies (GWASs)1,2 confer
small risk individually, but their combined effect, when

 summarized as a polygenic risk score (PRS), can be substan-
tial.3–5 Such genomic profiles can be used to stratify women
according to their risk of developing breast cancer.6 This in
turn holds the promise of improved breast cancer preven-
tion and survival, by targeting screening or other preventa-
tive strategies at those women most likely to benefit.
We previously derived a PRS based on 77 established
breast cancer susceptibility single-nucleotide polymor-
phisms (SNPs) and reported levels of risk stratification
achieved by this PRS.7 Based on our findings, several
studies have investigated the potential for combining
PRSs and other known risk factors for risk stratification
and evaluated the impact of risk reduction strategies across
risk strata defined by the PRS.8–10 Preliminary studies
investigating the use of the PRS to inform targeted breast
cancer screening programs are underway (see CORDIS

 and GenomeCanada in Web Resources).11,12 Empirical
validation and characterization of the PRS in large-scale
epidemiological studies has, however, not been carried
out previously. In addition, more informative PRSs would
improve the clinical utility of risk prediction. GWASs
have now identified �170 breast cancer susceptibility
loci.1,2 Moreover, genome-wide heritability estimates indi-
cate that these loci explain only �40% of the heritability
explained by all common variants on genome-wide SNP
arrays. This suggests that the discrimination provided by
the PRS could be improved by incorporating variants asso-
ciated at more liberal significance thresholds. In addition,
many variants confer risks that differ by breast cancer
subtype (estrogen-receptor [ER]-positive or -negative), sug-
gesting that subtype-specific PRSs might allow better pre-
diction of subtype-specific disease, including the more
aggressive ER-negative breast cancer, and enable selection
of women for preventative medication.

 Here, we used data from 79 studies conducted by the
Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) to optimize
PRSs for overall and subtype-specific disease, and we vali-
date their performance in independent datasets.1,13–15
Material and Methods
Study Subjects and Genotyping
The dataset used for development of the PRSs comprised 94,075
breast cancer-affected case subjects and 75,017 control subjects
of European ancestry from 69 studies in the BCAC (Tables S1
and S2). Data collection for individual studies is described
previously.1 Samples were genotyped using one of two arrays:
iCOGS13,14 and OncoArray.1,15 The dataset was divided into a
training and validation set. The validation set was randomly
selected (approximately 10% of case and control subjects) from
studies that had been genotyped with the OncoArray, after
excluding studies of bilateral breast cancer, studies or sub-studies
oversampling for family history, and individuals with in situ can-
cers or case subjects with unknown ER status.
The best PRSs were evaluated in an independent test dataset
comprising 11,428 invasive breast cancer-affected case subjects

 and 18,323 control subjects from ten studies nested within pro-
spective cohorts, all genotyped using the OncoArray (Tables S3
and S4). The overall breast cancer PRS was also evaluated among
190,040 women of European ancestry from the UK Biobank
cohort who had not had any cancer diagnosis or mastectomy prior
to recruitment. A total of 3,215 incident registry-confirmed inva-
sive breast cancers developed over 1,381,019 person years of
prospective follow-up. Follow-up started 6 months after age of
baseline questionnaire. The primary endpoint was invasive breast
cancer. Follow-up was censored at the earliest of: risk-reducing
mastectomy, diagnosis of any type of cancer, death, or January
15, 2017.
Genotype calling, quality control, and imputation for iCOGS
and OncoArray were performed as previously described.1,14
Briefly,
imputation
was
performed
for
the
iCOGS
and
OncoArray datasets separately using the Phase 3 (October
2014) release of the 1000 Genomes data as reference.16 We fol-
lowed a two-stage approach using SHAPEIT for phasing17 and
IMPUTE2 for the imputation.15 Where samples were genotyped
with iCOGS and OncoArray, the OncoArray calling was used.
SNPs with MAF > 0.01 and imputation r2 > 0.9 for OncoArray
and
r2
> 0.3
for iCOGS
were
included
in
this
analysis
(�7
million
SNPs);
a
higher
threshold
was
imposed
for
OncoArray to ensure accurate determination of the PRS in the
validation and test datasets.
UK Biobank samples were genotyped using Affymetrix UK
BiLEVE Axiom array and Affymetrix UK Biobank Axiom array
and imputed to the combined 1000 Genomes Project v.3 and
UK10K reference panels using SHAPEIT3 and IMPUTE3.18 The
lowest imputation info score for the SNPs used in these analyses
was 0.86. Samples were included on the basis of female sex
(genetic and self-reported) and ethnicity filter (Europeans/White
British ancestry subset). Duplicates, individuals with high degree
of relatedness (>10 relatives), and one of each related pair of first
degree relatives were removed. Samples were also excluded using
standard quality control criteria.
Participants provided written informed consent, all studies
were approved by the relevant ethics committees, and procedures
followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of these
committees.
Statistical Analysis
The general aim was to derive a PRS of the form:
PRS ¼ b1x1 þ b2x2 þ . þ bkxk. þ bnxn
where bk is the per-allele log odds ratio (OR) for breast cancer
associated with SNP k, xk is the allele dosage for SNP k, and n is
the total number of SNPs included in the PRS. Previous analyses
found no evidence for statistically significant interactions between
SNPs19,20 and little evidence for departures from a log-additive
model for individual SNPs. Assuming this is true in general,
the PRS summarizes efficiently the combined effects of SNPs on
disease risk.
The main challenge is how to determine which SNPs to include
and the weighting parameters bk to assign. Inclusion of only those
SNPs reaching a stringent significance threshold (‘‘genome-wide
significant,’’ p < 5 3 10�8) threshold ignores information from
larger numbers of SNPs that are likely, but not certain, to be
associated with the risk of breast cancer. We used two general

 approaches for model selection: ‘‘hard-thresholding,’’ based on a
stepwise regression model that retained SNPs significantly associ-
ated with overall or subtype-specific disease at a given threshold,
and penalized regression using lasso.21,22 A schema for the ana-
lyses is shown in Figure S1.
To prioritize SNPs for analysis, single SNP association tests were
first conducted in the training set. Per-allele ORs and standard er-
rors were estimated separately in the iCOGS and OncoArray data-
sets, adjusting for study and nine ancestry informative principal
components (PCs) in the iCOGS dataset and by country and ten
PCs in the OncoArray dataset, using a purpose-written program.1
Combined p values were then derived using a fixed-effects
meta-analysis with the software METAL.23 SNPs were sorted by
p value and filtered on LD, such that uncorrelated SNPs (correla-
tion r2 < 0.9) with lowest p value for association with overall
breast cancer in the training set were retained (more rigorous
pruning, for example at r2 < 0.2, would have removed from
consideration informative SNPs from regions with multiple corre-
lated signals24,25).
In the hard thresholding approach, a series of stepwise forward
regression analyses were first carried out in 1 Mb regions centered
on SNPs significant at a pre-specified threshold for association
with either overall and/or subtype-specific disease in the training
set. Only SNPs passing the specified p value thresholds were
included in each 1 Mb region. Two analyses were performed in
parallel: for overall breast cancer and ER-negative disease. At
each stage the SNP with the smallest (conditional) p value for
any analysis was added to the model, the threshold for the step-
wise regression being the same as that for pre-selection. The pro-
cess was repeated until no further SNPs could be added at the
pre-defined threshold. A second stage of stepwise regressions
were then carried out across all regions in each chromosome, to
take into account correlated SNPs in different regions. Finally,
the effect sizes for the selected SNPs were jointly estimated in a
single logistic regression model.
For the best-performing PRSs, SNPs associated with ER-positive
at p < 10�6 but not with overall breast cancer (at p < 10�5) were
added at the end of the final SNP list. A third round of stepwise
forward regression was then carried out with p value for selection
of p < 10�6 for ER-positive disease. For completeness we added to
this final PRS two rarer variants (BRCA2 p.Lys3326X and CHEK2
p.Ile157Tyr) which are established to confer a moderate risk of
breast cancer and were genotyped on the OncoArray but did
not pass the allele frequency threshold in the PRS development
phase.
For the penalized regression using lasso, we used the program
glmnet 21. SNPs with p < 0.001 in overall BC or ER-negative disease
in the training set were pre-selected for inclusion in the lasso, and
BRCA2 p.Lys3326X and CHEK2 p.Ile157Thr were added. Covari-
ates for 19 PCs (9 for iCOGs and 10 for Oncoarray) and country
were included in each model. For overall breast cancer, the penalty
parameter (lambda) giving the best overall breast cancer PRS in the
validation set was selected.
To construct subtype-specific PRSs, we evaluated four different
methods: (1) using effect sizes for overall breast cancer (for each
of the subtypes), (2) using effect sizes for subtype-specific (ER-pos-
itive or ER-negative) disease, (3) using a hybrid method, in which
effect sizes were estimated in the relevant subtype for SNPs passing
a certain optimal significance threshold in a case-only logistic
regression (ER-positive versus ER-negative disease), and otherwise,
using effect sizes estimated for overall breast cancer, or (4) by esti-
mating case-only ORs using lasso and combining these with the
overall breast cancer ORs to derive subtype-specific estimates,
using the formulae:
bERpositive ¼ boverall þ h � bcase�only
bERnegative ¼ boverall � ð1 � hÞ � bcase�only
where h ¼ 0.27 was the proportion of ER-negative tumors in the
validation set.
For the lasso analysis, effect sizes for subtype-specific disease were
estimated using method 4 above, combining the estimates from
a case-only lasso analysis with the coefficients for overall breast
cancer from the lasso analysis. The lambda for the case-only model
giving the best subtype-specific PRS in the validation set was
selected.
To evaluate the performance of each potential PRS, we standard-
ized the PRSs to have unit standard deviation (SD) in the valida-
tion set of control subjects. The association of the standardized
PRSs was evaluated in the validation and test (prospective studies)
datasets, by logistic regression. We used a Cox proportional haz-
ards regression model to assess the association with risk of breast
cancer in UK Biobank. Models were also compared in terms of
the area under the receiver operator characteristic curves (AUC),
adjusted for study, calculated using the Stata command comproc.
Meta-analysis of study-specific effects was carried out using the
Stata command metan.
The goodness of fit of the continuous model (i.e., assuming a
linear association between log(OR) and risk) was tested using the
Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) test to compare the observed and pre-
dicted risks by quantile and using the tail-based test proposed by
Song et al.26 In addition, we considered specifically the risks in
the highest and lowest 1% of the distribution.
Effect modification of the PRS by age and family history of
breast cancer in first-degree relatives was evaluated by fitting
additional interaction terms in the model. The validation and
prospective test datasets were combined for this analysis.
The absolute risks of developing breast cancer (overall and
subtype-specific disease) were calculated taking into account the
competing risk of dying from causes other than breast cancer, as
described previously,7 with the PRS modeled as a continuous
covariate and including a linear ‘‘age 3 PRS’’ interaction term.
The absolute risk of developing subtype-specific disease was
obtained constraining to the incidence of overall incidence of
ER-negative and ER-positive disease in the UK. Women are at
risk of developing both ER-negative and ER-positive disease, so
the absolute risks were calculated given that the individual has
been free of breast cancer of any subtype.
Analyses were carried out in R v.3.0.2 and Stata v.14.2. All tests
of statistical significance were two-sided. Further details are pro-
vided in the Supplemental Material and Methods.
Results
Development of the PRS
We tried several approaches to develop PRSs; here we
report results for models giving the highest prediction
accuracy. Using stepwise forward selection, the best PRS
for prediction of overall breast cancer was obtained at a
p value threshold for pre-selection and stepwise regression
of p < 10�5 (Table 1). The OR per unit standard deviation
(SD) for this 305-SNP PRS with overall breast cancer in
26
The American Journal of Human Genetics 104, 21–34, January 3, 2019
 the validation set was 1.65 (95%CI: 1.58–1.72), compared
with 1.59 (95%CI: 1.52–1.66) using a ‘‘genome-wide’’
(p < 5 3 10�8) threshold (123 SNPs).
Using lasso regression, the best PRS (OR ¼ 1.71, 95%CI:
1.64–1.79) was more predictive than the best PRS devel-
oped using the stepwise regression model. In the best
model (l ¼ 0.003), 3,820 SNPs were selected (Table 1).
Optimizing the PRS for Prediction of Subtype-Specific
Disease
For evaluation of subtype-specific models following step-
wise regression, SNP effect sizes were estimated, in the first
instance, in each disease subtype. The best subtype-specific
PRSs using this method were also obtained at a p value
threshold of p < 10�5 (Table S5). The 305-SNP PRS was
supplemented with 6 additional SNPs associated with
ER-positive at p value < 10�6 and, in addition, by two
known rare breast cancer susceptibility variants in the
BRCA2 and CHEK2 genes, bringing the total number of
SNPs included to 313 (PRS313).
The optimum subtype-specific PRS was obtained when a
subset of these 313 SNPs (196 SNPs with a case-only p value
for association with ER-negative versus ER-positive disease
of p < 0.025) were given subtype-specific weights, while
the remaining SNPs were given overall breast cancer
weights. For ER-negative disease, the OR improved from
OR ¼ 1.45 (95%CI: 1.35–1.56) to OR ¼ 1.47 (95%CI:
1.37–1.58) using the hybrid method compared with using
only subtype-specific estimates, while for ER-positive dis-
ease the results were similar (OR ¼ 1.74) (Tables S6 and S7).
Subtype-specific prediction using the lasso analysis
was optimized using case-only lasso analysis. The OR
per 1 SD in the validation set was 1.81 (95%CI: 1.73–
1.89) for ER-positive and 1.48 (95%CI: 1.37–1.59) for ER-
negative disease (Tables 2 and S8).
Validation of the PRS in the Prospective Test Dataset
The final PRSs were evaluated using data from 11,428 inva-
sive breast cancer-affected case subjects and 18,323 control
subjects from ten prospective studies. The ORs for both the
overall and subtype-specific PRSs were slightly lower in the
prospective test set compared to the validation set (Table 2).
The difference between validation and test set may reflect
some overfitting due to choosing the optimum p value
threshold and for the lasso, the optimum lambda, in the
validation set, but could also be due to somewhat different
characteristics of the prospective studies. The ORs for over-
all and ER-positive, but not ER-negative, breast cancer were
slightly higher for the 3,820-SNP PRS (PRS3820) compared
with PRS313.
The odds ratio (OR) for overall disease per 1 standard de-
viation (SD) of the PRS313 in the prospective studies was
1.61 (95%CI: 1.57–1.65) while for the 77-SNP PRS (PRS77)
derived previously OR ¼ 1.46 (95%CI: 1.42–1.49). For ER-
negative disease the difference was OR ¼ 1.45 (95%CI:
1.37–1.53) versus 1.35 (95%CI: 1.27–1.43) (Table 2).
The associations between the PRS and overall, ER-
positive, and ER-negative breast cancer by percentiles of
the PRS313 are shown in Figure 1 and Table S9. Compared
with women in the middle quintile (40th to 60th percen-
tile), those in the highest 1% of risk for the subtype-specific
PRS313 had 4.37 (95%CI: 3.59–5.33)- and 2.78 (95%CI:
1.83–4.24)-fold risks, and those in the lowest 1% had
0.16 (95%CI: 0.09–0.30)- and 0.27 (95%CI: 0.09–0.86)-
fold risks of developing ER-positive and ER-negative dis-
ease, respectively. The ORs by percentile of the PRS3820
were similar (Table S10).

 percentiles of the risk score were compared with those
predicted under a simple polygenic model with the PRS
considered as a continuous covariate. The effect sizes
did not differ from those predicted, and in particular
the estimates for the highest and lowest centile were
consistent
with
the
predicted
estimates
(Table
S9).
Further tests for goodness of fit and tail-based tests (see
Material and Methods) were not statistically significant
at p < 0.05.
There was no evidence of heterogeneity in the effect
sizes among studies (Figure 2). All studies showed a signif-
icant association with similar effect sizes for overall and
ER-positive breast cancer, and all but one study (FHRISK,
based on only six case subjects) showed a significant effect
for ER-negative breast cancer.
In the UK Biobank, the estimated hazard ratio (HR) for
overall breast cancer per unit PRS (including 306 of the
313 SNPs) was HR ¼ 1.59 (95%CI: 1.54–1.64) (Figure 2).
By way of comparison, we also evaluated a PRS based on
177 previously published susceptibility loci.1,2 The effect
size for this PRS (OR ¼ 1.61, 95%CI: 1.57–1.65) in the
ten prospective studies was similar to the PRS313. However,
this estimated effect size is biased because the validation
and test datasets used here contributed to the GWAS
discovery datasets; in the UK Biobank this PRS (based on
174 of 177 available SNPs) performed worse (HR ¼ 1.53,
95%CI: 1.48–1.58).
PRS Effects by Age
A weak decline in the OR with age was observed for ER-pos-
itive disease (p ¼ 0.001, for the combined validation and
test set). There was some evidence that the decline in PRS
OR was not linear, driven by a lower estimate below age
40 years (Table S11, Figure S2). There was no evidence
of a decline in the OR by age for ER-negative disease
(p ¼ 0.39).
Combined Effects of PRS and Breast Cancer Family
History
The association between PRS and disease risk was observed
for women with and without a family history (Table 3).
However, there was some evidence that for ER-positive dis-
ease, the PRS OR was smaller in women with a family his-
tory (interaction OR ¼ 0.91, p ¼ 0.004). The log OR for
family history was attenuated by 21% (1.59 to 1.44) and
12% (1.66 to 1.56) for ER-positive and ER-negative disease,
respectively, after adjusting for the PRS (Tables 3 and S12).
Absolute Risk of Developing Breast Cancer According to
the PRS
Estimated lifetime and 10-year absolute risks for UK
women in percentiles of the PRS are shown in Figure 3.
For ER-positive disease, the estimated lifetime absolute
risk by age 80 years ranged from 2% for women in the
lowest centile to 31% in the highest centile, while for
ER-negative disease, the absolute risks ranged from 0.55%
to 4%. The average 10-year absolute risk of breast cancer
for a 47-year-old woman (i.e., the age at which women
become eligible to enter the UK breast cancer screening
program) in the general population is 2.6%. However,
the 19% of women with the highest PRSs will attain this
level of risk by age 40 years.

Parameter selection and effect size estimation for derivation of the PRS was carried out in the training set as described in the Material and Methods. The optimal
subtype-specific PRS was obtained by carrying out case-only logistic regression and estimating effect sizes in the relevant subtype for SNPs passing a p value of
0.025 in case-only ordinary logistic regression (ER-positive versus ER-negative disease). OR for association with breast cancer in the validation set derived using
logistic regression adjusting for country and ten PCs. AUCs were adjusted for by country. In the prospective test set, logistic regression models were adjusted
for study and 15 PCs. AUCs were adjusted for by study.

 Discussion
We report development and independent validation of
polygenic risk scores for breast cancer, optimized for pre-
diction of subtype-specific disease and based on the largest
available GWAS dataset. The best PRS based on a hard
thresholding approach included 313 SNPs and was signifi-
cantly more predictive of risk than the previously reported
77-SNP PRS7 (OR per 1 SD in the prospective test set:
1.61 versus 1.46; Table 2). The effect sizes were remarkably

 consistent among the 10 cohorts in the prospective test
set, and also consistent with that in the UK Biobank cohort
(HR ¼ 1.59, 95%CI: 1.54–1.64).
Recently, Khera et al.27 derived a PRS using our publicly
available summary statistics based on analysis of the BCAC
data.1 We were able to construct a PRS based on 5,194 of
their 5,218 listed SNPs and compared this to our 313-SNP
PRS. In our analysis of this PRS in the prospective UK Bio-
bank data, we obtained a HR of 1.49 (95%CI: 1.44–1.54),
substantially lower than that for our PRS313. The corre-
sponding AUCs were 0.613 (95%CI: 0.603–0.623) for their
5,194-SNP PRS versus AUC 0.630 (95%CI: 0.620–0.640) for
PRS313. Similarly, PRS313 performed better than the Khera
et al. PRS in a Biobank dataset consisting of 7,113 case sub-
jects diagnosed before entry and 183,536 control subjects
(AUC ¼ 0.642 versus AUC ¼ 0.627). Khera et al. report a
much higher AUC (0.68), perhaps reflecting the inclusion
of predictors other than SNPs in their model (for example
age or principal components).
We specifically aimed to improve prediction for ER-nega-
tive breast cancer as to date prediction of this more aggres-
sive disease has been poor. SNP selection was based on
association with either ER-negative or overall breast can-
cer, and the optimum subtype-specific PRSs were derived
by weighting a subset of SNPs according to subtype-specific
effect sizes, with overall breast cancer weights used for the
remaining SNPs. These results are consistent with the
observation from genome-wide analyses that the heritabil-
ity of ER-positive and ER-negative disease are partially
correlated.2 The performance of the PRS313 in predicting
ER-negative disease was considerably improved over the
PRS77 reported previously (OR ¼ 1.45 versus 1.35). Never-
theless, the prediction is still better for ER-positive than
ER-negative disease, reflecting the fact that ER-negative
disease is more infrequent and hence the GWAS data are
less powerful. The estimated heritability of ER-negative dis-
ease is similar to that of overall breast cancer,1,2 suggesting
that more powerful ER-negative PRSs should be achievable
with larger sample sizes.
The best PRS developed using lasso was more predictive
for ER-positive disease but slightly less predictive for
ER-negative disease in the prospective studies. Given the
small differences between the models, we focused on
PRS313 since this should be more straightforward to imple-
ment in diagnostic laboratories using next generation
sequencing. However, this will change with developing
technology, and the cost effectiveness of using a large
marker panel should be further investigated.
From a clinical viewpoint, an important consideration
is the performance of the PRS in the tails of the distribu-
tion. According to the standard polygenic model, under
which the effects of variants combine multiplicatively,
the relationship between the PRS and the log-OR should
be linear. The PRS was well calibrated at different quan-
tiles. Even in this large study, we observed no deviation
from this model, and in particular the observed risks in
the highest and lowest centile were consistent with the
predicted risk. The sample sizes in the extreme tails, how-
ever, were still relatively small, particularly for ER-negative
disease.
While the AUC may appear modest, the predicted risk
differences in the tails of the distribution are large. For
the new PRS313, the women in the top 1% of the distribu-
tion have a predicted risk that is approximately 4-fold
larger than the risk in the middle quintile. The lifetime
risk of overall breast cancer in the top centile of the PRSs,
based on UK incidence and mortality data, was 32.6%.
Women in the top centile would therefore meet the UK
NICE definition of high risk (see Web Resources). In the
general population, an estimated 3.6%, 12%, 21%, and
35% of all breast cancers would be expected to occur in
women in the highest 1%, 5%, 10%, and 20% of the new

Association with breast cancer risk was tested for using logistic regression adjusting for study and ten PCs. For these analyses the validation and test datasets were
combined. Analyses were restricted to women with known age and family history information. For ER-negative disease, 4,440 women with and 13,132 women
without a family history of breast cancer were included in these analyses. For ER-positive disease, 6,787 women with and 17,351 women without a family history of
breast cancer were included in these analyses.

 PRS313, respectively, compared to only 9% of breast cancers
in women in the lowest 20% of the distribution.
We observed a decline in the relative risk with age for
ER-positive disease but not ER-negative disease. Even for
ER-positive disease, however, the predicted relative risk,
under a linear model, only declined from 1.89 at age 40
to 1.67 at age 70. While there was some indication of a
lower relative risk below age 40 (estimated as 1.63 in the
test set; Figure S2), these results indicate that PRS313 is
broadly applicable at all ages. We observed an attenuation
of the association between breast cancer family history and
breast cancer risk after adjustment for the PRS (�21% for
ER-positive, �12% for ER-negative disease). This finding
is broadly in line with the predicted contribution of the
PRS to the familial relative risk of breast cancer. The PRS
was predictive in women with and without a family his-
tory of breast cancer, but the OR was slightly lower in
women with a family history, at least for ER-positive dis-
ease. This might reflect a weaker relative effect of the PRS
in carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.28 We note, how-
ever, that the absolute differences in risk by PRS will be
larger in women with a family history. These results indi-
cate that the joint effects of family history and PRS need
to be considered in risk prediction.

 Although we used the largest training dataset available
to date for development of the PRS, further improvement
should still be possible. We previously estimated using
GWAS data that the theoretically best PRS, if the effect sizes
of all common SNPs were known with certainty, would
explain �41% of the familial risk of breast cancer, corre-
sponding to a standardized OR�2.1: the PRS313 explains
�45% of this ‘‘chip’’ heritability.1 This implies that larger
GWASs, coupled with penalized approaches for subtype-
specific disease, should further improve the predictive
value of the PRS. Certain genomic features, notably tran-
scription factor binding sites, are enriched among suscep-
tibility loci.1 Preliminary analyses incorporating these
features into the analysis did not improve the predictive
value, presumably because the enrichment effect was too
small to overcome the increased complexity of the model.
Better definition of genomic features to predict causal
variants, and more sophisticated methods for integrating
external biological information into prediction models,
may improve the PRS.29,30
The PRS has the potential to improve stratification for
screening, while ER-specific PRSs may be informative for pre-
vention with endocrine therapies. Previous studies have sug-
gested that the earlier PRS77 was more predictive for screen-
detected breast cancers than interval cancers, and that breast
cancers arising among women with a low PRS are more
aggressive compared with those arising in women with a
high PRS, perhaps reflecting the stronger associations with
ER-positivedisease.31,32 Itwillthereforebeimportanttoeval-
uate carefully the associations between the new PRS313 and
other tumor characteristics. Clinical translational studies
are required to assess the risks and benefits of including the
PRS in the context of current screening protocols.
While the PRS provides powerful risk discrimination,
better risk discrimination will be obtained by combining
the PRS with family history and other risk factors.10 This
can be accomplished by incorporating the PRS into risk
prediction models, in particular BOADICEA, which can
allow for the explicit effects of family history, age, genetic,
and other risk factors33,34 (see Supplemental Material and
Methods). However, further studies to validate risk models
for individualized risk prediction based on the combined
effects of genetic and lifestyle risk factors will be needed.
In addition, it is important to note that the PRSs generated
in this study were developed and validated in white Euro-
pean populations and need to be validated and potentially
adapted for other populations.
