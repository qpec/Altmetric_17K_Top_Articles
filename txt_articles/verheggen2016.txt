Summary
Exercise training (‘exercise’) and hypocaloric diet (‘diet’) are frequently prescribed
for weight loss in obesity. Whilst body weight changes are commonly used to
evaluate lifestyle interventions, visceral adiposity (VAT) is a more relevant and
stronger predictor for morbidity and mortality. A meta-analysis was performed to
assess the effects of exercise or diet on VAT (quantified by radiographic imaging).
Relevant databases were searched through May 2014. One hundred seventeen
studies (n = 4,815) were included. We found that both exercise and diet cause
VAT loss (P < 0.0001). When comparing diet versus training, diet caused a larger
weight loss (P = 0.04). In contrast, a trend was observed towards a larger VAT
decrease in exercise (P = 0.08). Changes in weight and VAT showed a strong
correlation after diet (R2 = 0.737, P < 0.001), and a modest correlation after
exercise (R2 = 0.451, P < 0.001). In the absence of weight loss, exercise is related
to 6.1% decrease in VAT, whilst diet showed virtually no change (1.1%). In
conclusion, both exercise and diet reduce VAT. Despite a larger effect of diet on
total body weight loss, exercise tends to have superior effects in reducing VAT.
Finally, total body weight loss does not necessarily reflect changes in VAT and
may represent a poor marker when evaluating benefits of lifestyle-interventions.
Keywords: Exercise training, hypocaloric diet, obesity, visceral adipose tissue.
obesity reviews (2016)
Introduction
The worldwide prevalence of obesity, characterized by an
excess in adipose tissue, has grown to pandemic proportions
(1,2). Multiple reviews have demonstrated that accumulation
of adipose tissue in general, and in the visceral area in
particular, is strongly and positively correlated with all-cause
morbidity and mortality (3). Because obesity is an important,
but also modifiable, risk factor for cardiovascular and
metabolic diseases (4,5), the World Health Organization has
recommended
lifestyle
interventions to aim at 5–10%
reduction in body weight as treatment for obesity (6).
Caloric restriction and exercise training cause a reduction
in body weight by inducing a negative energy balance in
which energy expenditure exceeds caloric intake. When
comparing hypocaloric diet and exercise training, previous
meta-analyses revealed that dietary restriction has superior
effects on weight reduction (7,8). However, a growing body
of evidence shows that excess visceral adipose tissue (VAT)
may result in more detrimental obesity-related health effects
than excess body weight (9). Indeed, increased VAT is
strongly associated with insulin resistance, atherogenic
dyslipidemia,
and
cardiovascular
disease
(3,10,11).
Moreover, a reduction in VAT improves cardiovascular

 and
metabolic
risk
(3,12).
Hence,
changing
VAT is
considered to be more important than weight reduction in
the management of obesity.
In patients with obesity, physical exercise training leads to a
healthier metabolic and cardiovascular phenotype (13–15).
Whilst exercise training does not always aim to reduce body
weight, exercise training in general and aerobic exercise
training in particular have potent effects on reducing VAT
(16–18). Previous meta-analyses have evaluated only the
effects of caloric restriction and aerobic exercise on weight
loss. The effects of these interventions on VAT have not yet
been compared. Therefore, we aimed to conduct a systematic
review and meta-analysis to investigate the effect of caloric
restriction versus aerobic exercise training on visceral adiposity
loss in overweight and obese adults. For this purpose, we
included studies that examined VAT after (i) caloric restriction
only, (ii) exercise training only and (iii) exercise training versus
caloric restriction. We hypothesize that, in marked contrast to
body weight loss, caloric restriction and exercise training have
comparable effects on reducing VAT. With the use of a meta-
regression analysis, we aimed to further explore the impact
of intervention (e.g. duration, intensity and frequency) and
subject (e.g. age, sex, baseline body weight) characteristics on
the magnitude of changes in VAT.
Several
international
guidelines
recommend
lifestyle
interventions aimed at a reduction in body weight of at least
5% as treatment for obesity (6,19,20). Previous work,
however, demonstrated that a reduction in body weight is a
poor marker for VAT change (9). Accordingly, changes in
VAT may occur irrespective of changes in body weight. A
hypocaloric diet causes a reduction in skeletal muscle mass,
which along with a reduction in fat mass, contributes to
weight loss (21,22). Aerobic exercise training, however, may
be associated with an increase in lean body mass and/or
plasma volume (23–25). Assuming that fat mass decreases
with exercise training, training may still not lead to weight
loss (24,26). Therefore, we hypothesize that the relation
between changes in body weight and changes in VAT differs
between caloric restriction and exercise interventions.
Methods
Data sources and searches
The systematic literature search and documentation of
literature was performed with the use of the preferred
reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis
statement (27). Databases systematically searched were
Pubmed, Cochrane, Web of Science and Embase. The
following search strategy was used, with adaption for each
database:

distribution")). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-
randomized controlled trials (non-RCTs) or clinical trials
published in English, German and Dutch were included from
1 January 1987 to 5 May 2014. Reference lists of included
articles were manually checked by R.V
. for possible eligible
studies that were missed during the literature search (Fig. 1).
This represents a valid and frequently used method to further
increase the number of potentially eligible studies.
Study selection
To standardize the selection procedure by two independent
reviewers (R. V. and M. M.), investigators received a
standardized protocol previous to the selection of studies.
After the elimination of duplicates, one investigator (R. V.)
screened study titles for eligibility with use of the inclusion
and exclusion criteria in the review protocol, which are
listed later. Two reviewers (R. V., M. M.) independently
screened the abstracts of the remaining studies. Three
hundred eighty-nine studies were assessed in full text
(Fig. 1). Inter-reviewer disagreements were resolved through
consensus or by consulting a third reviewer (M. H.). When
study characteristics or viable information was missing, an
attempt was made to request missing information from the
authors by email (n = 6 studies; authors of n = 2 studies
provided requested information). Studies were included
when the mean age at entry was ≥18 years and mean body
mass index was ≥25 kg m�2. Studies of HIV-infected
individuals were excluded because of the interference of
anti-retroviral drugs with abdominal adipose tissue (16).
Because spinal cord injuries are associated with changes in
body composition, studies conducted in spinal cord injured
individuals were also excluded (28). Studies with one or
more arms assigned to an aerobic exercise intervention or
a hypocaloric diet were eligible for inclusion. For the first
aim, clinical trials and RCTs with one arm assigned to
exercise or caloric restriction were selected. Furthermore,
in order to directly compare duration-matched and energy

 deficit-matched exercise training with caloric restriction,
RCTs with an exercise and a diet arm were included. To
identify exercise and subject characteristics that predict the
magnitude of change in VAT using the meta-regression
analysis, clinical trials and RCTs with one arm assigned to
exercise or caloric restriction were selected. Finally, diet
and exercise studies that provided baseline and post-
intervention results for VAT and weight were included for
the correlation analysis. Exercise training was defined as a
programme including voluntary aerobic exercise at a low
to vigorous intensity for at least two times per week during
a minimum period of 4 weeks and with a minimum duration
of 20 min per session. Caloric restriction was defined as a
daily reduction in energy (caloric) intake of at least 10%
of the habitual intake (2,000 kcal for women, 2,500 kcal
for
men)
during
a
minimum
period
of
4 weeks.
Interventions combining exercise and diet therapy or adding
resistance exercise or bariatric surgery to an intervention
arm were excluded. Studies in which a pharmacological
dietary supplement was used were excluded from our
analysis. Studies were eligible when VAT was measured with
the use of computerized tomography or magnetic resonance
imaging, which are both considered to be the gold standard
for the quantitative measurement of VAT (29). Studies that
used another measurement technique were excluded.
Data extraction and quality assessment
Baseline and post-intervention mean VAT area or volume
and standard deviation or standard error was independently
recorded by two authors (R. V., M. M.). When VAT was
measured at multiple sites, the measurement at the fourth

 and/or fifth lumbar vertebrae was recorded for further
analysis, because this region is most strongly correlated with
body
adiposity
(28).
Based
on
changes
in
visceral
abdominal fat area or volume, percentage change in VAT
for each study was calculated by one of the authors (R. V.)
for the correlation analysis. Percentage weight loss was also
calculated based on pre-intervention and post-intervention
values.
Furthermore,
publication
year,
journal,
study
design, sample size, age, sex, weight, body mass index and
intervention details (duration, intensity, frequency [exercise
studies], caloric deficit [diet studies]) were extracted from
all included studies. When results were depicted in figures
only (n = 14 studies), data were extracted with the use of
GetData Graph Digitizer. A request by email was send to
the authors, when key information was not included in the
published manuscript (n = 6 studies). Two out of six authors
responded to our repeated email requests; thus, the
remaining four studies were excluded from further analysis.
The quality of each eligible study was independently
assessed by two authors (R. V. and M. M.), with the use of
a modified version of The Critical Review Form for
Quantitative Studies, from Law et al. (30). One item
(‘contamination was avoided’) was not applicable for the
studies included in this meta-analysis and was therefore
removed for analysis. Only studies with a minimum score
of 10 out of 14 items were eligible for inclusion (Fig. 1).
Data synthesis and analysis
To account for potential heterogeneity between studies, a
random-effects model (specified a priori) was used to
determine the overall effect size of the intervention (exercise
training or hypocaloric diet) on VAT. Effect sizes for RCTs
and clinical trials were calculated as the standardized mean
difference (SMD) with corresponding 95% confidence
interval (CI). A correlation of 0.5 between the outcomes
measured in each study arm (i.e. exercise, diet or control)
was assumed. When a study contained multiple study arms,
all were included in the statistical analysis, whereby the
different intervention groups were individually compared
against the control group. Analyses to assess the following
comparisons (i) diet versus control, (ii) exercise versus
control and (iii) diet versus exercise were performed. The
Cochrane’s Q statistic and I2 were calculated to assess the
degree of heterogeneity across studies. Publication bias
was assessed using visual analysis of the funnel plot
asymmetry using the ‘trim and fill’ and the ‘Classic fail ‘n
safe’ algorithms. All calculations and plots were performed
in CMA-2 (Comprehensive Meta-analysis second version;
Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA).
Meta-regression analysis
To
assess
the
effects
of
subject
and
intervention
characteristics on VAT loss, random-effects meta-regression
analysis with SMD as dependent variable was calculated.
The weighted inverse variance (with correction for total n)
was used as weight factor. For the purpose of meta-
regression analysis, the aerobic exercise arms (n = 86) were
separated from the hypocaloric diet arms (n = 87). In both
study types, duration of the exercise training or diet
intervention (weeks), measurement technique (computerized
tomography or magnetic resonance imaging), body weight
at baseline, age and sex were defined as a covariate.
Duration was assessed as a categorical variable (duration
<16 weeks versus duration of ≥16 weeks). In the exercise
studies, intensity of the intervention was examined as a
covariate. Intensity was categorized in ‘vigourous intensity’
(i.e. largely performed at 70% of maximal heart rate
[maxHR], >55% of maximal oxygen uptake [VO2max] or
60–80% of the heart rate reserve), ‘moderate intensity’
(60–70% of maxHR, 45–55% of VO2max or at the lactate
threshold) and ‘low intensity’ (<60% of maxHR or <45%
of
VO2max)
based
on
previous
work
(18).
This
categorization is somewhat different from the often used
and
more
practical
categories
based
on
metabolic
equivalents of task (METs) as proposed in the American
College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and American Heart
Association guidelines (i.e. light [<3.0 METs], moderate
[3.0–6.0 METs] and vigorous [>6.0 METs]) (31,32). Only
two studies included in our meta-analysis provided data on
METs. Therefore, we adopted the aforementioned strategy
to divide studies based on intensity. In hypocaloric diet
studies, ‘intensity’ was divided in ‘very low calorie diets’
(reduction to maximal 800 kcal d�1) and ‘low calorie diets
(caloric restriction to 800–2,000 kcal d�1). Lastly, frequency
(times spent in training per week) was added as covariate in
exercise studies.
Correlation analysis
To examine correlations between weight loss and VAT
improvement,
a
Pearson
correlation
coefficient
was
calculated. The formula of the corresponding trend line
was retrieved with the use of linear regression. Meta-
regression analyses and correlation analysis were conducted
with use of SPSS version 22.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).
Results
Selection of studies for the meta-analysis
The original search resulted in 15,964 studies. Eleven more
studies were found from the reference lists of the included
full text papers. After removal of duplicates and elimination
of papers based on the eligibility criteria and quality
assessment, 50 aerobic exercise studies and 59 hypocaloric
diet studies were included (Fig. 1). For the analysis of a
direct comparison between caloric restriction and exercise
training, eight studies were included (Table 1). One study,
which directly compared exercise training with caloric

 restriction, was excluded as duration and energy deficit did
not match between the two intervention arms. This study
was included for the separate analysis of diet or exercise
training only.
Cohort characteristics
A total number of 4,815 individuals (2,404 in the exercise
studies
and
2,411
in
the
hypocaloric
diet
studies)
participated in the interventions (Table 1). In the eight RCTs
that
directly
compared
exercise
training
and
caloric
restriction, a total of 400 individuals were included (200
in the exercise arm and 200 in the diet arm). (Table 2); 28
studies exclusively included male subjects, whereas in 39
studies, female subjects were exclusively included. Fifty-five
studies included both sexes. Some studies recruited specific
populations, which included older (aged 50–80 years)
individuals (n = 4), patients with type 2 diabetes (n = 11),
impaired glucose tolerance (n = 3) and metabolic syndrome
(n = 3) (Table 1).
Meta-analysis
The SMD of change in VAT after exercise training was
�0.47 (95% CI �0.56 to �0.39, P < 0.0001). (Figure S1)
Heterogeneity analysis showed significant heterogeneity
(Cochran’s Q = 265.4; I2 = 68.0). Through a funnel plot of
standard error by Hedge’s g and the Trim ‘n Fill algorithm’,
publication bias was assessed. With the use of the Classic
Fail ‘n Safe approach’, it became clear that there was no
significant publication bias because 7,427 missing studies
would be required to achieve a P-value above 0.05. The
SMD of change in VAT after caloric restriction was �0.63
(95% CI �0.71 to �0.55, P < 0.0001) (Figure S2), whilst
significant
heterogeneity
was
present
(Cochran’s
Q = 236.0; I2 = 63.6). In these studies, no publication bias
was present because there would be 4,096 studies required
to achieve a P-value above 0.05.
Based on the studies that directly compared exercise
training and caloric restriction, exercise training caused a
non-significantly larger decrease in VAT (�0.59, 95% CI
�1.248 to 0.071; P = 0.08), whilst caloric restriction caused
a significantly larger weight loss than exercise training
(SMD 0.308, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.60; P = 0.04) (Fig. 2).
Heterogeneity analysis showed significant heterogeneity
(Cochran’s
Q = 51.9;
I2 = 86.5).
Publication
bias
was
assessed with the Trim ‘n Fill method’ and showed no
change in SMD when adding trimmed studies, for both
the weight loss as VAT loss data.
Meta-regression analysis
No effect of measurement technique on the SMD was
observed for studies that performed exercise training or diet
(data not shown). In the exercise studies, univariate analysis
revealed
that
the
SMD
for
VAT
improvement
was
significantly influenced by sex (R2 = 0.11; 95% CI 0.06 to
0.472; P = 0.012); duration (R2 = 0.073; 95% CI �0.449
to �0.055; P = 0.013) and frequency (R2 = 0.084; 95% CI
�0.157 to �0.030; P = 0.004). The multivariate regression
analysis, which included the factors that revealed a
significant impact in the univariate analysis, identified an
impact of male sex on SMD (R2 = 0.20; 95% CI 0.066 to
0.467; P = 0.01). In hypocaloric diet studies, univariate
analysis showed a significant effect of male sex only
(R2 = 0.09; 95% CI 0.116 to 0.632; P = 0.005).
Correlation analysis
For exercise studies, a moderate correlation was found
between changes in weight versus changes in VAT after
exercise
training
(R2 = 0.453,
P < 0.001),
whilst
diet-
interventions showed a strong correlation between the
change in weight versus change in VAT (R2 = 0.737,
P < 0.001) after caloric restriction. Exercise training showed
a somewhat steeper slope compared with diet (�3.04x
versus �2.41x, respectively), and a larger Y-axis intercept
(-6.1a versus -1.1, respectively, Fig. 3).
Discussion
The present work is the first meta-analysis to compare the
effect of caloric restriction and aerobic exercise training on
visceral adipose tissue (VAT) loss in overweight and obese
individuals. We present the following findings. First, our
results confirm that both caloric restriction and exercise
training successfully reduce VAT. Second, in studies that
provided a direct comparison of caloric restriction and
exercise training, a hypocaloric diet resulted in significantly
larger weight loss. Interestingly, these studies reveal a different
story for VAT. Exercise training tends to show a larger
decrease in VAT compared to caloric restriction. The distinct
effects of both interventions on total body weight and VAT
are supported by the correlation analysis. Only a moderate
correlation was found for the exercise training cohort
between changes in weight and VAT. Furthermore, in the
absence of weight loss, exercise training results in a 6.1%
decrease in VAT, whilst a hypocaloric diet leads to virtually
no change (1.1%). This suggests that evaluating only total
body weight changes could lead to spurious conclusions when
evaluating the efficacy of a lifestyle intervention in overweight
and
obese
individuals
because
health
benefits
occur
independent of body weight changes. Indeed, even in the
absence of weight loss after exercise training, health benefits
such as a reduction in VAT are present.
In line with previous meta-analyses, we found caloric
restriction to have a larger effect on weight loss than
exercise training (7,8). We extended this finding by a direct
comparison of studies with matched duration and energy
deficit in order to more accurately compare the impact of
both interventions. In marked contrast to the superior effect

 of caloric restriction on weight loss, no difference in VAT
reduction was observed between caloric restriction and
exercise training. In fact, exercise training tended to have a
superior effect on VAT reduction compared with caloric
restriction. A possible mechanism underlying these different
effects on weight and VAT could relate to distinct changes in
body composition during these lifestyle interventions.
During caloric restriction, both muscle mass and fat mass
are lost, resulting in a marked decline in weight (21,22).
During exercise training, however, lean body mass and
circulating
plasma
volume
increase,
whilst
fat
mass
decreases (21,23,25,26,33). Previous work that directly
measured these factors indeed showed that an increase in
lean body mass counteracts loss of fat mass after 8 weeks
of exercise training (34). These opposing effects resulted in
the absence of total body weight loss (34). Appreciating
and
understanding
these
effects
are
important
to
acknowledge that exercise training effectively reduces VAT,
despite the absence of a reduction in body weight.
In this meta-analysis, a large number of studies were
included. Multivariate meta-regression analysis on these
data showed that male sex is associated with a larger
decrease in VAT, in both exercise and diet interventions.
Other subject and intervention characteristics did not
influence the magnitude of VAT loss in the multivariate
model. A possible explanation that underlies the larger effect
of exercise training and caloric restriction on VAT in men is
that men typically have larger VAT stores than women. As
a result, this makes male participants more likely to lose
VAT than female participants (35). However, our meta-
regression analysis showed no effect of baseline VAT area
on the magnitude of VAT decrease. The exact underlying
mechanisms should be subject for future research.
The distinct effects of diet and exercise training on weight
and VAT suggest the presence of a different correlation
between changes in body weight and VAT after caloric
restriction in comparison with exercise training. Indeed,
whilst a strong correlation between changes in body weight
and VAT was found after caloric restriction, this correlation
was only moderate for exercise training studies. This means
that a change in weight after hypocaloric diet predicts a
substantial effect on VAT, whereas changes in weight after
exercise training only modestly predict the change in VAT.
Furthermore, the trend lines for these correlations show
important differences. The Y intercept for the correlation
of exercise studies is 6.1%, meaning that the absence of
weight loss after exercise training is still correlated with a
significant and meaningful reduction in VAT of 6.1%. In
marked
contrast,
studies
examining
the
impact
of
hypocaloric diet revealed a Y-intercept of only 1.1%, which
means that in the absence of weight loss only 1.1% of VAT
is lost. Furthermore, the steepness of the correlation for
exercise training is slightly higher than that observed after
hypocaloric diet. Taken together, these data strongly

Limitations
The presence of heterogeneity of the included studies may
represent a potential limitation when interpreting the results
of this review. However, to correct for this heterogeneity
a random effect approach was selected to perform the
meta-analyses, which was specified a priori. Furthermore,
analysis of publication bias with use of the Classic Fail ‘n Safe
method showed that an unrealistically large number of
studies is needed to influence the significant results obtained
in our meta-analyses. Therefore, we are confident that the
heterogeneity observed in the studies included in this analysis
does not impact the major conclusions of our study. Another
limitation might be that our study provides no insight into the
potential impact of ethnicity on our observation, since this
subject information was often lacking in the included studies.
However, our analysis is not biased by the inclusion of a single

 ethnic group only, because we included studies that were
conducted on all continents.
Clinical relevance
As treatment for obesity, international guidelines including
World
Health
Organization
and
ACSM
guidelines
recommend a minimum of 5% loss of body weight loss
(4,6,20).
Although
in
common
clinical
practice,
a
combination of training and hypocaloric diet is often
prescribed, it is highly relevant to understand the separate
effects of these interventions. Indeed, our study reveals that
effects on weight loss and VAT loss are different in training
and diet interventions. For example, a 5% reduction in
body weight after hypocaloric diet has a different effect on
VAT than a similar reduction in body weight after exercise
training. Indeed, 5% loss in body weight is associated with
21.3% reduction in VAT after exercise training, but only
with 13.4% reduction in VAT after a hypocaloric diet. To
reduce VAT by 13.4% after exercise training, weight loss
of only 2.4% is needed. Moreover, the absence of a
reduction in body weight after exercise training may lead
physicians to incorrectly conclude that the intervention has
failed. This is in accordance with the ACSM position
statement on appropriate physical intervention strategies
for weight loss, which also emphasized that exercise
training entails health benefits beyond the effects on body
weight (20). In fact, it is likely that a clinically relevant
VAT reduction (of 6.1%) is present in the absence of weight
loss after exercise training, which may lead to reductions in
cardiovascular risk and improvement in metabolic health.
Therefore, it seems incorrect to recommend a 5% weight
loss for all lifestyle interventions.
In conclusion, our systematic review and meta-analysis
provide evidence that exercise training, despite smaller
effects on reducing body weight, tends to have superior
effects on reducing visceral adipose tissue compared with
diet interventions in overweight and obese subjects. This
suggests that changes in body weight represent a poor
marker for adaptation in visceral adipose tissue, especially
when performing exercise training. Our data therefore
strongly indicate that, in clinical practice, caution should
be taken when interpreting (lack in) changes of body weight
after exercise training interventions. Incorrect conclusions
can potentially lead to recommendations or suggestions that
the exercise intervention was unsuccessful, despite the
presence of a marked effect on body composition. Setting
the correct targets for evaluating the health benefits of
lifestyle interventions is therefore recommended.
