Abstract: We report a novel less-invasive extrapleural pneumonectomy
for early-stage malignant pleural mesothelioma without rib spreading.
Our approach is unique and differed from the previously reported cases,
because we used one skin incision and two small intercostal incisions
with videothoracoscopic viewing without rib spreading. The pleural dis-
section and approach to the hilum for pneumonectomy were performed
through a 4- to 5-cm port incision in the sixth intercostal space. Another
4- to 5-cm port was made in the eight intercostal space through the same
skin incision and was used for diaphragm resection and reconstruction.
At the end of the surgery, the skin incision was enlarged to 8 cm;
through which and the first port in the sixth intercostal space, the
resected specimen was retrieved. Three cycles of adjuvant chemothe-
rapy followed by radiation therapy were administered. Eleven-month
follow-up showed no recurrence.

S
urgical management for malignant pleural mesothelioma
(MPM) remains controversial, but because of the limitations
of radiation and chemotherapy in this disease, surgery is still an
important part of treatment for these patients. Curative intent op-
erations for MPM include extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP)
and extended pleurectomy/decortication (P/D), both aiming to
obtain a macroscopic R0 resection.1,2 However, standard EPP
remains one of the most invasive and painful thoracic surgery pro-
cedure with significant morbidity and mortality compared with
P/D.3 Thus, to reduce the surgical trauma, herein, we proposed
a less-invasive EPP for early-stage MPM using one skin incision
and two small intercostal incisions with videothoracoscopic view-
ing without rib spreading.
CASE REPORT
A 51-year-old man was referred for the management of
left-sided epithelioid MPM diagnosed at another hospital through
a surgical biopsy. He underwent two cycles of induction cisplatin/
pemetrexed chemotherapy. Computed tomography and positron
emission tomography scan (http://links.lww.com/INNOV/A90)
showed no local or distant diseases (Fig. 1); thus, mediastinal in-
vasive staging was not performed. The good performance status
of the patient due to young age and the lack of comorbidities,
the normal body mass index (body mass index = 23 kg/m2),
and the early stage of the tumor supported the feasibility of EPP
.
Patient was aware of pros and cons of our approach and gave a
specific written informed consent.
Under general anesthesia with selective intubation, the pa-
tient was placed in lateral decubitus as for left thoracotomy. A
5-cm posterolateral incision through the left sixth intercostal
space was performed without rib spreading (Fig. 2). The parietal
pleura was dissected in a blind fashion with fingers placed outside
the parietal pleura to create a space for inserting thoracoscope.
The dissection continued with videothoracoscopic viewing. The
parietal pleura was dissected from the endothoracic fascia up to
apex of the chest, then anteriorly to pericardium, posteriorly to
spine, and down the diaphragm. During dissection, the hemosta-
sis was performed with Harmonic scalpel (Ultracision Harmonic;
Johnson&Johnson, Somerville, NJ USA). The tumor was mobi-
lized away from the underlying mediastinal structures exposing
the hilum (http://links.lww.com/INNOV/A91). The subcarinal
lymph node was resected to show the main left bronchus.
Using the same skin incision, a second 4- to 5-cm incision
was performed at level of the eight intercostal space to approach
diaphragm. The main left bronchus and pulmonary artery, in that
order, were divided using staplers. The pericardium was cir-
cumferentially opened to encompass the tumor. The superior
and inferior pulmonary veins were stapled intrapericardially
(http://links.lww.com/INNOV/A92). The diaphragm was discon-
nected circumferentially from the chest wall, and a sponge stick
technique was used to separate the peritoneum from the inferior
diaphragmatic surface. The peritoneum was dissected off bluntly

 and left intact. The specimen was removed en block through the
sixth intercostal space access enlarged to 8 cm without rib spread-
ing (http://links.lww.com/INNOV/A93). After the lung specimen
was removed, all mediastinal lymph nodes including stations
number 5, 6, 8, and 9 were resected. Left hemidiaphragm was re-
placed with a 20 � 30-cm 2-mm Gore-Tex prosthetic patch
(http://links.lww.com/INNOV/A94). The pericardium was resected
and not reconstructed. A single chest tube was inserted through the
incision. The operation was summarized in Figure 3 and Video 1.
The overall surgical time was 450 minutes and estimate
blood lost was 500 mL. Epidural analgesia was used for control
pain, and pain intensity score was less than 4 (0–10 visual ana-
logue scale) for the entire postoperative course. No intraopera-
tive or postoperative complications occurred, and the patient
was discharged 11 days later. Pathological examination revealed
an epithelioid-type mesothelioma without mediastinal and hilar
lymph node involvement (pT2N0M0). Three cycles of adjuvant
chemotherapy, followed by radiation therapy, were administered.
Eleven-month follow-up showed no recurrence.
DISCUSSION
The standard of care for patients with MPM has not been
established. Extrapleural pneumonectomy has been performed as
a treatment option. Despite a heightened interest in EPP for the
past decade, concerns about the morbidity (range, 2.5%–48%)
and mortality (range, 0%–11.8%) of this surgical procedure and
its efficacy have delayed a consensus in its practice.3,4 Standard
EPP is one of the most invasive and painful thoracic surgery
procedures, and recently, less-invasive procedures have been
proposed to minimize surgical trauma. Suda et al5 and Demmy
et al6 performed EPP using a three- to fourth-port video-
assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) approach with a utility
incision without rib spreading. In line with this strategy, we
proposed a less-invasive EPP for early-stage MPM. Our tech-
nique was unique and differed from the previously reported
cases5,6 because we used one skin incision and two small inter-
costal incisions with videothoracoscopic viewing without rib
spreading. The pleural dissection and approach to the hilum
for pneumonectomy were performed through a 4- to 5-cm port
incision in the sixth intercostal space. Another 4- to 5-cm port
was made in the eight intercostal space through the same skin in-
cision and was used for diaphragm resection and reconstruction.
At the end of the surgery, the skin incision was enlarged to 8 cm,
through which and the first port in the sixth intercostal space, the
resected specimen was retrieved.
The preoperative evaluation is crucial for the success of
our procedure. It aims to determine whether the patient has

 potentially resectable tumor and sufficient cardiopulmonary
reserve to undergo the planned operation. The radiological
identification of metastatic diseases in the peritoneum or in the
contralateral lung and pleura precluded the feasibility of our pro-
cedure. In addition, the poor respiratory reserve and/or underly-
ing cardiovascular disease excluded using this approach also if
the tumor was potentially resectable, because EPP places pa-
tients at high risk for respiratory failure due to resection of the
entire lung and for myocardial ischemia because of intraopera-
tive blood loss and postoperative fluid shifts. In these cases,
other approaches as P/D should be advocated over EPP
. From
a technical point of view, previous talc pleurodesis is an abso-
lute contraindication for our technique because the tenacious
pleural adhesions could make unfeasible the extrapleural dis-
section, whereas a body mass index more than 30 is a relative
contraindication. Obtaining access for mediastinal dissection can
be difficult in patients with significant subcutaneous obesity or
mediastinal adipose tissue. Thus, in this case, the use of longer
ports and of a wound protector can provide easier access into
the chest.7
The “tips and pitfalls” of this technique are (1) the correct
identification of the plane between the tumor and the other me-
diastinal structures as the aorta and the esophagus during
pleurectomy, (2) the injury of the peritoneum that could favor tu-
mor implants during diaphragm resection, and (3) the anchoring
of the patch to the lateral chestwall during diaphragm recon-
struction because of the difficult angle. Obviously, there are
reasonable concerns regarding some aspects of our approach.
(1) The decision to not reconstruct the pericardium was a hazard
because of potential life-threatening complications. Pericardial
reconstruction is always indicated after EPP for MPM. Right-
sided pericardioplasty is performed to prevent cardiac disloca-
tion. Left-sided pericardial defects that result after EPP are large,
and there is no risk of cardiac strangulation, but reconstruction is
recommended to prevent constrictive epicarditis.8 Furthermore,
reconstruction of large pericardial defect also after EPP for
MPM by minimally invasive means is previously reported.5,6
Thus, we will take care to reconstruct the diaphragm in future
similar cases. (2) Despite that an 8-cm skin incision was re-
quired for retrieving the specimen, we did not start with the
bigger skin incision. This choice was mainly due to the fact
that we did not know whether we might have to convert. In ad-
dition, enlarging port incision only at the end of the procedure
could concur to minimize the thoracic parietal trauma and re-
duce postoperative pain.9
In agreement with the well-defined advantages of VATS
compared with standard thoracotomy in surgical treatment of
lung diseases, the minimal incisions and the lack of rib spread-
ing of our approach would help reduce pain, morbidity, acceler-
ate convalescence for adjuvant therapies, and minimize wound
surface area with possible tumor contamination. Unfortunately,
our speculations cannot be demonstrated because of lack of con-
trol group, but other authors5,6 also expected similar advantages
after VATS EPP
. Finally, despite not all readers necessarily agree
with adopting EPP for MPM and with all aspects of our ap-
proach, some of the technical suggestions listed in our video

prosthetic patch, whereas the pericardium was not reconstructed (D).

 might prove useful for management of other pleural pathologies
with more favorable tumor biology than MPM. Obviously, more
data from future experiences are needed before any conclusion
can be drawn.
