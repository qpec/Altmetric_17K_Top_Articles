Sex differences in recent first-onset depression in an
epidemiological sample of adolescents

Prior studies provide limited and contradictory evidence regarding sex differences in the incidence of depression during
adolescence, a critical period for development of the disorder. Data from six consecutive years (2009–2014) of a national survey of
US adolescents aged 12–17 (N = 101 685) are used to characterize sex differences in the incidence of depression by age and to
compare recent first-onset and persistent depression with respect to impairment, suicide attempts, conduct problems and
academic functioning. Projecting from age-specific incidence proportions, the cumulative incidence of depression between the
ages of 12 and 17 is 13.6% among male and 36.1% among female subjects. The sex difference in incidence is significant at the age
of 12 years (5.2% in female versus 2.0% in male subjects, Po0.0001), and it is significantly larger at ages of 13 through 17 years
than at the age of 12 years (P-valueso0.05). Depression-related impairment is lower in recent first-onset than in persistent
depression among female but not among male subjects. The prevalence of conduct problems and poor academic functioning is
higher in both recent first-onset and persistent depression relative to those with no depression for both male and female subjects.
The incidence of depression during adolescence is higher than that suggested by prior studies based on retrospective recall.
Contrary to prior studies, evidence suggests that the sex difference in depression originates during childhood and grows in
magnitude during adolescence. High levels of impairment, suicide attempts, conduct problems and poor academic functioning
argue against a 'wait and see' approach to clinical treatment of recent first-onset depression.

INTRODUCTION
Major
depression
has
a
complex
course
characterized
by
intermittent acute episodes1 of varying length,2–4 severity5 and
frequency.6,7 An aim of epidemiological research has been to
isolate and study specific temporal stages of the disorder to
identify causal mechanisms that operate at different points in its
course and to guide treatment efforts to the cases most likely to
benefit from clinical care.8 The occurrence of depressive episodes
during adolescence has received particularly close attention. It is
during adolescence that risk for depression increases markedly9
and the functional impairments with the potential for long-term
impact, such as failure to achieve academic milestones, begin to
occur.10,11 However, prior studies provide limited information on
the incidence of depression, that is, the first occurrence of a major
depressive episode, during this age period. Information on
incidence is important for testing etiologic hypotheses and for
informing clinical work. For instance, there is evidence from some
studies that male and female subjects have similar risk for
depression during childhood, but female subjects begin to have
higher risk when they reach their early teens.12–15 This evidence
has led to studies of biological and social mechanisms for
the apparent adolescent emergence of the sex difference in
depression;16–18 however, the underlying pattern has not been
rigorously
tested
in
epidemiological
data.
From
a
clinical
perspective, it may be the case that incident cases are associated
with lower levels of impairment than persistent cases, supporting
the suggestion that clinicians should 'wait and see'19 whether
recent-onset cases become persistent before initiating treatment.
Several national studies have examined the prevalence of
depression in adolescent samples, some using rating scales20,21
and some using diagnostic interviews.9,22 These studies are limited
because prevalent cases include a mixture of persistent and
recent-onset cases.23 Two methodological approaches have been
taken
to

separate
from
persistence. Longitudinal studies with assessments of depression
at multiple time points during childhood and adolescence have
found that higher prevalence among female subjects emerges in
early adolescence; however, these studies have limited power to
detect changes in sex differences across time.12,24 The one
longitudinal study to examine sex differences in incident cases, a
birth cohort study from New Zealand, reported that the incidence
of depression among female subjects began to exceed that
among males between the ages of 13 and 15 years.13 However,
that study may not have detected a sex difference at earlier ages
because of the small number of prevalent cases at the initial
assessment at the age of 11 years.
In contrast, single-interview studies with larger sample sizes
have enabled researchers to reconstruct incidence curves using
retrospective reports of depression at the age of onset.9,25 These
'retrospective incidence' studies suggest that sex difference in

 depression emerges prior to adolescence.9,26 A major limitation of
these studies is that they underestimate incidence due to recall
bias with many cases going unreported because they are
forgotten over time.27,28
In this study we use a large nationally representative sample of
adolescents at the ages of 12–17 years, drawn from multiple years
of a repeated cross-sectional survey, to address these limitations.
We examine sex differences in the incidence of recent first-onset
depression, defined by reports of first-in-lifetime depressive
episode with onset within 1 year of age prior to interview. This
approach mitigates the under-reporting bias that has been shown
to affect retrospective incidence studies.29 The large sample size
provides sufficient power to detect sex differences at each year of
age, which has been lacking in longitudinal studies.
The study has two goals. First, we aim to compare sex-specific
incidence of recent first-onset depression over this critical age
range, during which, according to prior research, the excess risk of
depression among female subjects emerges. This hypothesis has
never been tested with data on recent first onset of depression in
a large epidemiological sample. Second, we test whether recent
first-onset cases differ from persistent cases, that is, prevalent
cases with prior onset, with respect to key clinical and func-
tional correlates of adolescent depression—impairment, suicide
attempts, conduct problems and school functioning.30 We expect
persistent cases, due to their duration, to be associated with more
severe impairment, higher likelihood of suicide attempt, higher
levels
of
conduct
problem
and
poorer
school
functioning
compared with recent first-onset cases. If this is the case, then
persistence over time may be a clinically meaningful indicator for
treatment needed among adolescents with depression.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample
Data on adolescents aged 12–17 years from six consecutive years (2009–
2014) of the National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), an annual
cross-sectional survey conducted in a representative sample of the US
population, were analyzed. The NSDUH is based on a stratified multistage
area probability sample designed to be representative of the entire US and
of each of the 50 states and the District of Colombia. The NSDUH has an
annual sample size target of 67 500 respondents, with 25% falling in the
12–17 age group studied here.31 The weighted overall response rate for
the complete sample (all ages, not just adolescents), which is the screening
response rate multiplied by the interview response rate, ranges from 66.8
to 58.3% during this time period. The interview response rate is higher for
the adolescent sample than that for the adult sample. Sample weights
adjust for non-response and demographic characteristics at the household
and individual levels as described in methodological reports available on
the survey website (https://www.samhsa.gov/data/population-data-nsduh/
reports?tab = 39).
Interviews were completed in-person by trained interviewers. Sensitive
questions, including mental health assessments, were asked using
computer-assisted methods, where respondents enter their responses
directly into a secure computer. Questions may be read aloud by the
interviewer, read by the respondent or played to the respondent through
headphones. Computer-assisted methods help maintain privacy and
confidentiality and reduce response bias.32 Procedures for analysis of the
publicly accessible NSDUH data were approved by the RAND Human
Subjects Protection Committee.
Measures
Depression.
Depression was assessed according to Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Version IV criteria using an
instrument adapted to the A-CASI format from that used in the National
Comorbidity
Survey
Replication-Adolescent
Supplement.31
A
clinical
reappraisal
study
of
the
National
Comorbidity
Survey
Replication-
Adolescent Supplement found high sensitivity and specificity for the
instrument when depression assessments were compared with blinded
clinical interviews.33 Respondents reporting a major depressive episode are
asked their age at the first time that they had such an episode and whether
they had been experiencing such episodes within the 12 months prior to
the interview. Information on timing was used to classify respondents who
met criteria for a depressive episode into the following three mutually
exclusive categories:
Recent first onset: Respondent reports age at first-in-lifetime depressive
episode as either their current age or at 1 year prior to their current age.
Persistent: Respondent reports being in a depressive episode within the
past 12 months and onset of their first depressive episode at more than 1
year of age prior to their current age.
Remitted: Respondent reports not having been in an episode within the
past 12 months and onset of their first depressive episode at more than 1
year of age prior to their current age.
Impairment.
The Sheehan Disability Scale was used to assess depression-
related impairment among respondents reporting a depressive episode in
the past 12 months (that is, categories 1 and 2 above). The Sheehan
Disability Scale uses a visual analog scale to assess limitations on a scale of
0–10 in each of four domains: chores at home, school or work, close
relationships with family and social life.34,35 A rating of ⩾ 7 in at least one
domain is considered to be severe impairment.
Suicide attempt.
Respondents reporting depressive symptoms within the
past year were asked whether they had attempted suicide during a
depressive episode.
Conduct problems.
Respondents were asked how frequently they had
engaged in the following five conduct problems within the past year: (1)
getting into a serious fight at school or work; (2) taking part in a fight in
which one group fought against another; (3) carrying a handgun; (4) selling
illegal drugs; and (5) stealing or trying to steal something worth more than
$50. Each conduct problem was coded as present if the respondent
reported one or more occurrence during the past year.
Academic functioning.
Respondents were asked a series of four Likert
style questions regarding their school experiences within the past year.
Questions addressed how often they felt that their school work is
meaningful and important, how important they think their school work will
be later in life, how interesting their courses are and how often teachers let
them know they were doing a good job. Responses to these items were
used to define indicators of poor academic functioning, for example,
seldom or never versus sometimes or always. Respondents were also asked
their average grades during their most recent school grading period.
Responses were used to define an indicator of grade average of C or lower.
Statistical analysis
Incidence proportions, that is, the number of recent first-onset cases
divided by the total number of individuals without a prior depressive
episode (that is, remitted or persistent depression), were calculated
separately for males and female subjects at the ages of 12–17 years. Age
variation in the sex difference in incidence proportion was tested using a
logistic regression model. Age-specific annual incidence rates were
calculated by dividing the incidence proportions by 1.5, as on average
respondents reported on 18 months prior to the interview. Cumulative
incidence was calculated by multiplying each age-specific rate by the
proportion of the population without prior depression and summing
across ages. Among respondents with past-year depression, recent first-
onset cases were compared with persistent cases with respect to
impairment and occurrence of suicide attempts. Associations of depression
category with each correlate were estimated in logistic regression models
with statistical control for age, sex and their interaction. Models with
statistical
interactions
between
sex
and
depression
category
had
significantly better fit than models without these interactions as evidenced
by lower Akaike information criteria36 and Bayesian information criteria.37
Consequently, all results are shown separately for female subjects
and males.
Among the full sample, recent first-onset cases were compared with
persistent cases and those reporting no depression with respect to
conduct problems and indicators of poor school functioning (remitted
cases were included in the no-depression category). Associations of the
depression categories with each correlate were estimated in logistic
regression models with statistical controls for age, sex and their

 interaction. As with impairment results, because of statistical interactions
between sex and depression categories, results are presented separately
for female subjects and males.
All statistical analyses were conducted using STATA survey procedures
to adjust s.e.'s for the survey design.38 The statistical programming code is
available from the authors.
RESULTS
Prevalence of depression
The sample is 48.9% female and roughly equally distributed across
ages, ranging from 15% to 17% across the six age groups. Of the
entire sample, 14% report having had an episode of depression
(Table 1). Recent first-onset depression is more common than
persistent or remitted depression, accounting for just under half of
all cases for both males and female subjects. Prevalence is higher
among female subjects than males among all three categories.
Sex differences in depression incidence by age
The incidence proportion of recent first-onset depression is higher
in female subjects than in males at all ages (Figure 1a). At the age
of 12, the incidence proportion is 5.7% among female subjects
and 2.0% among males. The incidence proportion is highest at the
age of 15 for female subjects, when it reaches 13.2%, and at the
age of 17 for males, when it reaches 4.9%. The incidence
difference between female subjects and males also varies across
ages. The incidence difference at the age of 12 is 3.7%, and it is
significantly larger at each subsequent age, reaching 8.8% at the
age of 15 before declining slightly to 5.7% at the age of 17 (P-
values for pairwise comparisons all o0.05). In relative terms,
female subjects are 2.8 times more likely to develop depression
than males at the age of 12 and between 3.1 and 4.0 times as
likely as males to develop depression at the ages 13 through 16.
The relative risk of 2.2 at the age of 17 is lower than that at the age
of 12. On the basis of the age- and sex-specific incidence
proportions, nearly three times as many female subjects (36.1%) as
males (13.6%) will experience first onset of depression between
the ages of 12 and 17 (Figure 1b).
Impairment due to depression
Table 2 shows the prevalence of moderate or severe impairment
across four domains and suicide attempts among respondents
with past-year depression for persistent and first-onset cases.
Among female subjects, persistent cases have significantly higher
levels of impairment for all domains and higher rates of suicide
attempts than recent first-onset cases. In contrast, among males
there is a significant difference between persistent and recent
first-onset cases for only one of the four domains, chores at home,
and, for that domain, the prevalence is higher among the recent
first-onset cases. There is no significant difference among males in
prevalence of suicide attempts.
Conduct problems and academic functioning
The top panel of Table 3 shows the prevalence of conduct
problems in those with recent first-onset depression, persistent
depression and no depression by sex. Conduct problems are
significantly more common in the two groups with depression
than in the no-depression group in all but 2 of the 26 possible
comparisons; the prevalence of ‘carried a handgun’ does not differ
between the persistent and no-depression groups among males
(P = 0.0655) or between the recent first-onset and no-depression
groups among female subjects (P = 0.6401). There are significant
differences between the recent first-onset and persistent depres-
sion groups, but only among female subjects. Among female
subjects the persistent depression group has significantly higher
prevalence for four of the six conduct problems and for the
indicator of having at least two of the conduct problems.
The bottom panel of Table 3 shows comparisons across the
same groups for measures of poor academic functioning. The
prevalence of poor academic functioning indicators is higher in
two groups with depression than in the no-depression group in all
but 1 of the 24 possible comparisons; the prevalence of ‘Grades in
the last semester C or lower’ does not differ between the
persistent and no-depression groups for males (P = 0.0653). There
are differences between recent first-onset and persistent cases
with respect to two of the five indicators, but only among males,
and these differences go in opposite directions for different
indicators. Males with persistent depression are more likely than
males with recent first-onset depression to have three or more
indicators of poor academic functioning.
DISCUSSION
This study of the incidence of first onset of depression in a
nationally representative sample of adolescents found projections
of cumulative incidence of recent first-onset depression of 13.6%
for males and 36.1% for female subjects between the ages of 12–
17, substantially higher than estimates based on direct tabulation
of recalled cases. For comparison, the lifetime prevalence of
depression in the sample was 8% among males and 20.2% among
female subjects. This finding confirms the suggestion that
estimates of lifetime prevalence based on retrospective recall
underestimate the cumulative prevalence due to under-reporting
of prior depressive episodes.27 Our approach for examining first
onset and cumulative incidence makes an important contribution,
given that retrospective recall can be influenced by some clinical
characteristics of the disorder, including persistence over time.28,39
Based primarily on longitudinal studies, which have found that
the sex difference in prevalence of depression first emerges
between the ages of 12 and 15, researchers have suggested that
risk factors first appearing during adolescence must account for
the high prevalence of the disorder among female subjects
relative to males.40–42 Evidence from this study partially contra-
dicts this view. The data suggest that the sex difference in
incidence of depression is already quite large among the 12-year-
old respondents, who were reporting onsets that occurred when

 they were as young as 11 years for age. The finding that the sex
difference in depression begins prior to adolescence, and thus
may be influenced by factors occurring during childhood, is
consistent with prior studies based on retrospective reports.9
There is also prior evidence that sex differences in childhood
anxiety disorders have a role in sex differences in depression later
in life.43 The hypothesis that risk factors appearing during
adolescence contribute to the sex difference in depression is also
partially supported by the finding that the difference between
males and female subjects in incidence of depression increases
with age.
We hypothesized that indicators of impairment, conduct
problems and poor academic functioning, which are common
correlates of depression among adolescents, would be more
common among those with persistent depression than those with
recent first-onset depression. The results support this hypothesis,
but only for female subjects. Among respondents with past-year
depression, we found substantially higher levels of impairment
and attempted suicide among female subjects with persistent
depression compared with recent-onset depression, but no
comparable pattern among males. This pattern is perhaps most
striking for suicide attempts; among males there is no difference
across the groups (16.3% versus 15.1%), whereas among female
subjects those with recent first onset are nearly half as likely to
have attempted suicide than those with persistent depression
(15.8% versus 28.7%). Notably, the National Comorbidity Survey
Replication-Adolescent Supplement found a threefold difference
in the prevalence of suicide attempt between those with severe
versus mild or moderate depression.9 Sex differences in this
relationship deserve additional research attention.
The findings regarding conduct problems are similar; the
prevalence of conduct problems is higher among the persistent
than among the recent first-onset group among female subjects
but not among males. With respect to indicators of poor academic
functioning, differences between recent first-onset and persistent
depression groups were generally not statistically significant,
although there was some evidence of poorer functioning in the
persistent group among males.
The analyses presented here do not address the direction of
causality between depression, impairment, conduct problems and
poor academic functioning. Rather, the clinical motivation for
testing the difference between recent first-onset and persistent
cases with respect to these correlates of depression was to
examine whether it might be justifiable to prioritize persistent
cases, treating recent first-onset cases with a ‘wait and see’
approach, which research suggests is common among clinicians.19
Even for those correlates where the hypothesis was supported by
the evidence, that is, stronger associations were found for
persistent than for recent first-onset cases, this clinical implication
was not supported by the data. Differences between persistent

 and recent first-onset cases are small in comparison with the
differences between both groups and those with no depression.
For instance, the prevalence of suicide attempt in the past year
was over 15% for both female subjects and males with recent first-
onset depression. This evidence clearly does not support taking a
‘wait and see’ approach to recent first-onset cases of depression in
clinical settings.
These findings should be interpreted in light of two limitations.
First, although the method of estimating the incidence proportion
reduces the impact of recall bias, as those with recent disorders
are more likely to report accurately, it is not completely free from
this bias, as it still relies on retrospective report of the occurrence
(or non-occurrence) and age of onset of depressive episodes.
Specifically, some respondents with prior episodes of depression
will have forgotten those episodes and be incorrectly classified as
having never had depression. As the denominators for the
incidence proportions will therefore be inflated, the estimated
incidence proportions will be biased downward. However, this
downward bias is likely to be smaller than the more pervasive
impact of recall bias on reporting of lifetime prevalence. This
means that our projections of the cumulative incidence between
the ages of 12 and 17 are likely to be underestimates of the true
cumulative incidence during this age period.
Second, the assessments of impairment, conduct problems and
academic functioning are based on self-report. Owing to the
influence of depression on self-perception, it is likely that these
assessments are biased toward higher prevalence among those
with depression. This bias is unlikely to influence comparisons
between recent first-onset cases and prior onset past-year cases.
Third, the persistent depression category in this study combines
cases that are chronic with cases that are recurrent, although
research suggests there are clinically significant differences
between these subgroups.44,45
The high prevalence and varied course of depression makes it
challenging to study in epidemiologic samples. However, due to
the low level of clinical treatment,46 these studies are essential to
understand its causes and its individual and societal burdens. The
strategy used here to compile a sample of first-onset cases helps
advance our understanding of the basic epidemiology of the
disorder and may contribute to a new strategy for etiologic
studies.

males (P = 0.0655); and (3) grades in the last semester C or lower does not differ between the persistent and no-depression groups for males (P = 0.0653).
Figures in bold indicate statistically significant differences between the recent-onset and persistent groups.
