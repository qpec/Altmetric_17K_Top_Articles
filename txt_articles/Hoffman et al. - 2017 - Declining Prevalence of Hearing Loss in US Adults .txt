IMPORTANCE As the US population ages, effective health care planning requires
understanding the changes in prevalence of hearing loss.
OBJECTIVE To determine if age- and sex-specific prevalence of adult hearing loss has changed
during the past decade.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We analyzed audiometric data from adults aged 20 to
69 years from the 2011-2012 cycle of the US National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey, a cross-sectional, nationally representative interview and examination survey of the
civilian, noninstitutionalized population, and compared them with data from the 1999-2004
cycles. Logistic regression was used to examine unadjusted, age- and sex-adjusted, and
multivariable-adjusted associations with demographic, noise exposure, and cardiovascular
risk factors. Data analysis was performed from April 28 to June 3, 2016.
INTERVENTIONS Audiometry and questionnaires.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Speech-frequency hearing impairment (HI) defined by
pure-tone average of thresholds at 4 frequencies (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz) greater than 25
decibels hearing level (HL), and high-frequency HI defined by pure-tone average of
thresholds at 3 frequencies (3, 4, and 6 kHz) greater than 25 decibels HL.
RESULTS Based on 3831 participants with complete threshold measurements (1953 men and
1878 women; mean [SD] age, 43.6 [14.4] years), the 2011-2012 nationally weighted adult
prevalence of unilateral and bilateral speech-frequency HI was 14.1% (27.7 million) compared
with 15.9% (28.0 million) for the 1999-2004 cycles; after adjustment for age and sex, the
difference was significant (odds ratio [OR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.56-0.86). Men had nearly twice
the prevalence of speech-frequency HI (18.6% [17.8 million]) as women (9.6% [9.7 million]).
For individuals aged 60 to 69 years, speech-frequency HI prevalence was 39.3% (95% CI,
30.7%-48.7%). In adjusted multivariable analyses for bilateral speech-frequency HI, age was
the major risk factor (60-69 years: OR, 39.5; 95% CI, 10.5-149.4); however, male sex (OR, 1.8;
95% CI, 1.1-3.0), non-Hispanic white (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.3-3.9) and non-Hispanic Asian
race/ethnicity (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1-4.2), lower educational level (less than high school: OR,
4.2; 95% CI, 2.1-8.5), and heavy use of firearms (�1000 rounds fired: OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-3.0)
were also significant risk factors. Additional associations for high-frequency HI were
Mexican-American (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3-3.1) and other Hispanic race/ethnicity (OR, 2.4; 95%
CI, 1.4-4.0) and the combination of loud and very loud noise exposure occupationally and
outside of work (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.4-4.2).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Adult hearing loss is common and associated with age, other
demographic factors (sex, race/ethnicity, and educational level), and noise exposure.
Age- and sex-specific prevalence of HI continues to decline. Despite the benefit of delayed
onset of HI, hearing health care needs will increase as the US population grows and ages.

S
ince1959,theUnitedStateshasconductedexamination-
based health surveys measuring hearing thresholds in
nationally representative samples at specified ages (eg,
young children aged 6-11 years, adolescents aged 12-17 or 12-19
years, and adults ≥18 or ≥20 years). Hearing testing in adults
has been accomplished in 4 surveys. The 1959-1962 National
Health Examination Survey performed air-conduction hear-
ing threshold tests in each ear at 6 frequencies (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4,
and 6 kHz) in adults aged 18 to 74 years. The first National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) in 1971-
1975 tested hearing in each ear at 4 frequencies (0.5, 1, 2, and
4 kHz) in adults aged 25 to 74 years. Since 1999, NHANES has
operated continuously in 2-year cycles; during 1999-2004 and
2011-2012, NHANES conducted hearing tests in each ear at 7
frequencies (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 kHz) in adults aged 20 to
69 years. The 1999-2004 data encompassed 3 cycles to accu-
mulate a sufficient sample size since audiometric tests were
performed on only half the respondents coming to the mo-
bile examination centers. It was previously reported that high-
frequency (3-6 kHz) hearing thresholds for people of specified
age and sex groups were better in 1999-2004 than in 1959-
1962; most of these differences were statistically significant.1
In this article, we report the prevalence of hearing impair-
ment (HI) in more recent data from the 2011-2012 NHANES
compared with the 1999-2004 cycles to determine whether
hearing in US adults has continued to improve. In addition, we
report the associations between well-known risk factors (ie,
demographic, noise exposure, and cardiovascular) and the
prevalence of HI in the 2011-2012 NHANES.
Methods
The NHANES is conducted by the National Center for Health
Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to moni-
tor the health and nutritional status of the civilian, noninsti-
tutionalized US population. The survey includes an in-
person interview covering sociodemographic characteristics,
health status, risk factors, and other health-associated infor-
mation, as well as a physical examination. Race/ethnicity was
self-reported using federal guidelines. The survey uses a com-
plex, multistage, stratified, cluster design with oversampling
of targeted subgroups to produce nationally representative es-
timates. During the 1999-2004 cycles, NHANES oversampled
non-Hispanic black and Mexican-American, low-income, ado-
lescents aged 12 to 19 years, and adults 60 years or older to ob-
tain reliable data for these subgroups.2 In the 2011-2012 cycle,
NHANESoversampledHispanic,non-HispanicAsian,andnon-
Hispanic black individuals, as well as all individuals (regard-
less of race or ethnicity) who were at or below 130% of the pov-
erty index and/or 80 years or older.3
TheNHANES1999-2004cyclesconductedaudiometricex-
aminations on half the sample of interviewed adults aged 20
to 69 years; audiometric examinations in the NHANES 2011-
2012 cycle were conducted on a full sample of interviewed
adults in the same age range. Participation rates for audiom-
etry in NHANES 1999-2004 were 67.5% (5291 of 7835) of the
eligible sample (ie, those selected for the survey) and 87.8%
(5291 of 6026) of participants who actually agreed to partici-
pate and completed the household interview. Response rates
for NHANES 2011-2012 were 57.4% (3831 of 6671) of the eli-
gible sample and 81.9% (3831 of 4677) of participants who ac-
tually agreed to participate and completed the household in-
terview; the lower response rates coincided with the NHANES
decision to begin oversampling other (non–Mexican-
American) Hispanic and non-Hispanic Asian subgroups. Both
surveys were approved by the National Center for Health Sta-
tistics Institutional Review Board, and all participants pro-
vided written consent. In all survey cycles, the audiometry ex-
amination was conducted by trained NHANES health
technicians and included otoscopy, tympanometry, and air-
conduction, pure-tone audiometry.
Audiometric testing was conducted in sound booths
(model Delta 142; Acoustic Systems) in mobile examination
centers, which were transported to each survey location. Am-
bient noise met the American National Standards Institute S3.1
standards for maximum permissible ambient noise levels.4,5
During testing, background noise was monitored continu-
ously. Thresholds were obtained using an AD226 micropro-
cessor audiometer (Interacoustics), which met the specifica-
tionsofAmericanNationalStandardsInstituteS3.6-1996.6The
audiometric testing protocols are available on the National
Center for Health Statistics website.7,8
Thresholdswereobtainedusingapulsed-tonestimulusand
modified Hughson-Westlake procedure.9 Thresholds were ob-
tained in each ear at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 kHz. Retest thresh-
olds were obtained at 1 kHz in each ear to confirm consistency;
the second 1-kHz threshold was used in this analysis. The first
test ear was alternated and tones were initially presented at
40 decibels (dB) hearing level (HL), then followed by adjusting
the level up by 5 dB or down by 10 dB until the threshold was
found. Threshold was defined as the level at which the partici-
pantrespondedatleast50%ofthetimetoascendingordescend-
ing presentations. Thresholds were usually obtained using
supra-aural Telephonics Dynamic Headphone–type or TDH
headphones (Telephonics); insert transducers (EARtone 3A;
EtymoticResearchInc)wereusedwhenparticipantshadcollaps-
ingearcanals.Maskingwasnotused;however,thresholdswere

tained with insert earphones were used in the analysis.
Key Points
Question What changes have occurred in the prevalence of age-
and sex-specific hearing loss during the past decade for adults
aged 20 to 69 years?
Findings Using data from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey, this study found that while the prevalence of
hearing loss has continued to decline among adults aged 20 to 69
years, adult hearing loss is associated with increasing age, sex,
race/ethnicity, educational level, and noise exposure.
Meaning These results are consistent with a delayed onset of
hearing loss to older ages and increased hearing health care needs
as the US population grows and ages.

The audiometric test protocol was identical during both
surveyperiods.However,thesupra-auralheadphoneschanged
from model TDH-39P to TDH-49P in NHANES 2011-2012 to
avoid potential calibration errors at 6 kHz when using an
NBS-9A style coupler (Quest Technologies).10 This change
might have improved thresholds at 6 kHz; however, we could
not find statistically significant evidence of such improve-
ment.Arecentstudyexaminedthresholdmeasurementsusing
TDH-39P headphones and found negligible evidence of spu-
rious 6 kHz notches.11
The NHANES household questionnaire was adminis-
teredbytrainedinterviewersintheparticipant’
shomeviacom-
puter-assistedpersonalinterview.The1999-2004andthe2011-
2012 survey questionnaires included similar questions on
hearing health and risk factors, including self-assessed hear-
ing ability, use of hearing aids, tinnitus, and both occupa-
tional and nonoccupational exposure to noise. Other NHANES
questionnaires collected information on important covari-
ates, including cardiovascular disease risk factors.
There were some differences between the questions in the
NHANES 1999-2004 and 2011-2012 interviews. First, work-
associated noise exposure in the NHANES 1999-2004 was de-
finedasexposurefor“atleast3months”inthe“currentjob”and/
orthe“jobheldthelongest”;durationofexposurewasinferred
from length of time each job was held. Noise exposure in other
jobswasassessedbyaskingaboutnoiseexposurelastingatleast
3 months “in any job” with no further measure of duration. In
2011-2012,respondentswereaskedifthey“everhadajob,orcom-
bination of jobs” that included noise exposure “for 4 or more
hours a day, several days a week?” and, if so, “for how many
months or years?” the exposure occurred.
Second, in 1999-2004, participants were asked about non-
occupational noise, such as “power tools or loud music,” that
occurred “on average at least once per month for a year.” In
2011-2012, participants were asked about nonoccupational
“noise or music” exposures such as that from “power tools,
lawn mowers, farm machinery, cars, trucks, motorcycles, mo-
torboats, or loud music” that lasted “10 or more hours a week.
”
Third, the 1999-2004 questionnaire asked about expo-
sure to loud occupational or nonoccupational noise, defined
as noise “so loud that you had to speak in a raised voice to be
heard.
”In2011-2012,participantswereaskedadditionallyabout
very loud noise, defined as “noise so loud you have to shout
in order to be understood by someone standing 3 feet away.”
Finally, in 1999-2004, only nonoccupational noise from
firearmswasassessed,viathequestion,“Outsideofwork,have
you ever been exposed to firearms noise for an average of at
least once a month for a year?” Both occupational and nonoc-
cupational noise from firearms was assessed in 2011-2012, and
participants were asked to “estimate the total lifetime num-
ber of rounds fired.”
In both survey periods, participants were classified posi-
tive for diabetes if they answered “yes” to “Have you ever been
told by a doctor or other health professional that you have dia-
betes or sugar diabetes?” or “Are you now taking diabetic pills
toloweryourbloodsugar?”orhada2-hourfastingglucoselevel
of 126 mg/dL or more (to convert to millimoles per liter, mul-
tiply by 0.0555). Participants were classified positive for
hypertension if they answered “yes” to “Have you ever been
told you have high blood pressure?” or “Are you taking a pre-
scription for hypertension?” or, if during the examination in
the mobile examination center, the mean of 4 blood pressure
measurements was more than 140 mm Hg (systolic) or more
than90mmHg(diastolic).Smokinghistorywasdefinedasnon-
smoker if the respondent answered “no” to “Have you smoked
at least 100 cigarettes in your life?” Current and former smok-
ers were divided into 2 groups: less than 20 pack-years (ie,
smoked 1 pack [20 cigarettes] daily for <20 years) and 20 pack-
years or more (ie, smoked 1 pack [20 cigarettes] daily for ≥20
years).AdditionalinformationisavailableontheNationalCen-
ter for Health Statistics website.3
Statistical Analysis
Data analysis was performed from April 28 to June 3, 2016. The
statistical programs SAS, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc), and
SUDAAN (Research Triangle Institute International) were used
to incorporate the NHANES examination sample weights,
which accounted for differential probabilities of selection and
adjustments for oversampling of selected populations, non-
response, and noncoverage (for groups in the population that
do not appear in the sample).
Based on 3831 adults with complete threshold measure-
ments, the speech-frequency pure-tone average (PTA) was cal-
culated across 4 test frequencies (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz) and the
high-frequency PTA was calculated across 3 test frequencies
(3, 4, and 6 kHz) in each ear. The ear with the lower PTA was
considered the better ear for that set of frequencies. Hearing
impairment was defined by PTAs greater than 25 dB HL. This
criterion for mild or worse HI has been used in other surveys12;
it is strongly associated with self-reported hearing difficulty.13
Bilateral HI is defined as PTA in the better ear at greater than
25 dB HL. Unilateral HI is defined as PTA in the worse ear at
greater than 25 dB HL and PTA in the better ear at 25 dB HL or
less. Overall HI includes both unilateral and bilateral HI and
is equivalent to HI in the worse ear.
We calculated the prevalence of HI across several demo-
graphic, noise exposure, and cardiovascular risk factors. We
also compared the prevalence of HI for individual frequen-
cies and PTAs between the 1999-2004 and 2011-2012 cycles.
The hearing threshold data from the 2 time periods were com-
bined, maintaining appropriate survey weights, and then odds
ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs for HI were calculated using SUDAAN
logistic regression adjusting for age and sex. The SUDAAN lo-
gistic regression procedure was also used to calculate ORs and
95%CIsforbilateral(betterear)speech-frequencyHIandhigh-
frequency HI in the following 3 different analyses: unad-
justed (each variable separately in the predictive model), age-
and sex-adjusted (each variable plus age and sex in the
predictive model), and multivariable-adjusted (all variables in-
cluded in the predictive model).
Results
In the 2011-2012 cycle, the prevalence of unilateral speech-
frequency HI was 6.6% (13.0 million) and the prevalence of

bilateral speech-frequency HI was 7.5% (14.7 million) (Table 1).
The prevalence of overall (unilateral plus bilateral) speech-
frequency HI in the 2011-2012 cycle among adults aged 20 to
69 years was 14.1% (27.7 million), which is reduced from the
prevalence of 15.9% (28.0 million) published for NHANES
1999-2004.14 After adjustment for age and sex, the compari-
sonofspeech-frequencyHIintheworseear(2011-2012vs1999-
2004) shows a significant reduction (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.56-
0.86) (Table 2).
High-frequency HI was more prevalent than speech-
frequency HI, affecting 31.1% (61.1 million) in the 2011-2012
cycle compared with 31.9% in the 1999-2004 cycle.14 Al-
though the apparent reduction between the 2011-2012 and
1999-2004 cycles appears slight, after adjustment for age and
sex (Table 2), the decline in high-frequency HI in the worse ear
is also statistically significant (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.65-0.88).
The effect of age is shown in the Figure. For almost all age
groups and both sexes, prevalence of HI is lower in the 2011-
2012 cycle, although most 95% CIs overlap. A more informa-
tive comparison of the data from the 2011-2012 and 1999-
2004 cycles is shown in Table 2, which adjusts for age and sex,
since there were relatively more adults aged 50 to 59 years and
60 to 69 years in the 2011-2012 cycle. For most audiometric
frequencies except 1 kHz (in the better ear) and 8 kHz (in both
ears), the age- and sex-adjusted ORs in Table 2 were less than
1.00, suggesting better hearing in the 2011-2012 cycle. Statis-
tical significance was found for high-frequency HI in the bet-
terear(OR,0.78;95%CI,0.64-0.94;P = .01)andworseear(OR,
0.75; 95% CI, 0.65-0.88; P = .001) and for speech-frequency
HI in the worse ear (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.56-0.86; P = .001),
while the better ear failed to achieve significance (OR, 0.75;
95% CI, 0.56-1.00; P = .053).
Nearly twice as many men (18.6% [17.8 million]) as women
(9.6% [9.7 million]) had speech-frequency HI. The preva-
lence of bilateral high-frequency HI was even greater in men
(27.6%[26.9million])thaninwomen(10.6%[11.1million]).The
prevalence of speech-frequency HI reaches 39.3% (10.8 mil-
lion) for those aged 60 to 69 years and, for all categories of HI,
the prevalence rises sharply above ages 30 to 39 years. The
prevalence of bilateral speech-frequency HI rises about 27-
fold over 3 decades of age, approximately 3-fold per decade.
Other factors significantly associated with HI were non-
Hispanic white race/ethnicity, lower educational level, occu-
pational noise exposure, use of firearms (≥1000 rounds fired
inalifetime),smoking(≥20pack-years),hypertension,anddia-
betes. Many of these risk factors are correlated with one an-
other; for example, diabetes is more prevalent in older people.
A clearer understanding of HI risks requires multivari-
ableanalysis(Table3)ofthedemographic,noiseexposure,and
cardiovascularriskfactors.Unadjustedoddsratiosconfirmthat
non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.4-3.8),
educational level less than high school (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.8-
5.3), 5 years or more of exposure to very loud occupational
noise (OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 2.1-6.7), 1000 or more firearm rounds
fired in a lifetime (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.7-5.7), a 20 pack-year or
longer history of smoking (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 2.1-3.7), hyperten-
sion (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.6-3.0), and diabetes (OR, 2.4; 95% CI,
1.7-3.3) are associated with increased prevalence of bilateral
speech-frequency HI. After adjustment for age and sex, how-
ever, hypertension (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.7-1.4) and diabetes (OR,
1.1; 95% CI, 0.8-1.6) were no longer associated with increased
prevalence of bilateral speech-frequency HI.
After adjustment for all risk factors, age had the strongest
association with HI: compared with participants aged 20 to 29
years, those aged 60 to 69 years had a 39.5 higher odds of bi-
lateral speech-frequency HI (95% CI, 10.5-149.4). Other than
age,theriskfactormostassociatedwithriskofbilateralspeech-
frequency HI was educational level less than high school (OR,
4.2; 95% CI, 2.1-8.5). Male sex (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-3.0), non-
Hispanic white race/ethnicity (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.3-3.9), and
lower educational level (high school diploma: OR, 2.8; 95% CI,
1.2-6.9; some college or associate degree: OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.2-
4.9) remained significantly associated with bilateral speech-
frequency HI, but no cardiovascular variables retained statis-
ticallysignificantassociations.Ofthenoiseexposurevariables,
only 1000 or more firearm rounds fired in a lifetime retained
a statistically significant association (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-3.0).
Since the hearing threshold average of the speech frequen-
cies is not as sensitive to the effects of noise (and some other
exposures) as the hearing loss in the higher frequencies, we
also evaluated the association of all demographic, noise ex-
posure, and cardiovascular variables with hearing loss as de-
termined by bilateral high-frequency HI (Table 4). Several vari-
ables have stronger associations in the multivariable model
with high-frequency HI than with speech-frequency HI, in-
cluding male sex (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.7-5.4), 5 years or more of
exposure to very loud occupational noise (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3-
2.9), and possibly diabetes (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 0.9-2.6).
Discussion
Age-adjusted prevalence of HI in adults aged 20 to 69 years
declined from the 1999-2004 cycles to the 2011-2012 cycle of
the NHANES. However, the US population grew during that de-
cade and the age distribution also changed, with dispropor-
tionate growth (augmented by Baby Boomers born approxi-
mately between 1946 and 1964) of older adults who are more
likely to have HI. Based on NHANES tabulation of Census Bu-
reau estimates in 2011-2012, there were 196.6 million civil-
ian, noninstitionalized US adults aged 20 to 69 years, which
is 20 million more than the mean annual number of 176.2 mil-
lion in 1999-2004. The relative shift in the percentage of adults
aged 60 to 69 years was 34.8% (increasing from 11.5% [20.6
million] to 15.5% [27.6 million]) and, similarly, the percent-
ageofadultsaged50to59yearsgrewby18.9%(increasingfrom
18.1% [32.2 million] to 21.5% [38.3 million]). Despite these un-
favorable demographic shifts, the estimated number of adults
aged 20 to 69 years with hearing loss declined absolutely, from
an estimate of 28.0 million in the 1999-2004 cycles to 27.7 mil-
lion in the 2011-2012 cycle. The reason for this decrease is the
decline in overall prevalence from 15.9% to 14.1%. The per-
centage decrease of adults with hearing loss is small, at less
than 1%; however, one could have expected the opposite re-
sult based on the changing demographic figures. Hence, the
decrease in overall prevalence of hearing loss between the

Survey; PTA, pure-tone average.
a The total number of US civilian, noninstitutionalized adults aged 20 to 69 y in the 2011-2012 NHANES was 196.6
million.
bSpeech-frequency HI is defined as PTA of thresholds at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz greater than 25 decibels (dB) HL.
c High-frequency HI is defined as PTA of thresholds at 3, 4, and 6 kHz greater than 25 dB HL.
dOverall HI sums unilateral and bilateral HI, which means HI in either or both ears (ie, a worse-ear definition of HI).
e Unilateral HI means the PTA in only 1 ear exceeds 25 dB HL.
f Bilateral HI means the PTAs in both ears exceed 25 dB HL (ie, a better-ear definition of HI).
g Diabetes was defined by a positive response to the following questions: “Have you ever been told by a doctor or
other health professional that you have diabetes or sugar diabetes?”or “
Are you now taking diabetic pills to
lower blood sugar?”, or a 2-h fasting glucose level of 126 mg/dL or more (to convert to millimoles per liter,
multiply by 0.0555).
h Occupational noise exposure is defined as: “
exposed at work to loud sounds or noise for 4 or more hours, several
days a week”. In addition, separate categories distinguish adults who had only loud noise exposure at work (“
so
loud that they had to raise their voice to be heard”) vs those who also had very loud noise exposure at work (“
so
loud that they had to shout to be understood by someone standing 3 feet away”); see complete wording of the
question in the Methods section.
i Noise exposure outside of work is defined as: “
Outside of a job, have you ever been exposed to very loud noise
or music for 10 or more hours a week?”Examples are noise from power tools, lawn mowers, farm machinery,
cars, trucks, motorcycles, motor boats, or loud music.

2 time periods was sufficient to reduce slightly the number of
adults aged 20 to 69 years with hearing loss. The continuing
decline in the prevalence of HI in adults aged 20 to 69 years
may represent delayed onset of age-related hearing loss.
Audiometric testing of adults 70 years or older was not con-
ducted during the 1999-2004 or 2011-2012 survey cycles, but

this group has a much higher prevalence of HI than any of the
age groups shown in Table 1,15,16 and their relative numbers
are expected to continue growing rapidly.17
This finding of declining age-adjusted prevalence of HI,
combined with both earlier reports showing improvement of
hearingbetween1959-1962and1999-2004,1,16andsimilarfind-
ings by others, such as the hearing loss studies conducted in
BeaverDam,Wisconsin,18suggestsabeneficialtrendthatspans
at least half a century. Explanations for this trend are specu-
lative, but could include reduction in exposure to occupa-
tional noise (fewer manufacturing jobs, more use of hearing
protection devices), less smoking, and better management of
othercardiovascularriskfactors,suchashypertensionanddia-
betes. Less plausible explanations, especially for beneficial
changes in the most recent decade, might include fewer ear
infections that are managed better as well as improved diet.
Male sex and non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity continue
to be significant risk factors for HI, even after accounting for
riskfactorsthatmightbemoreprevalentinnon-Hispanicwhite
men, such as noise exposure. The typical noise exposures of
men and women are different, especially at high levels of
exposure.19 Although we controlled for noise exposure and sex
in the multivariable analyses, it remains possible the ques-
tions about noise exposure were inadequate to represent life-
time noise exposure, in which case there may have been re-
sidualconfounding.20,21Despitethisconcern,wesuspectthere
are major contributions that are genetic and probably not ame-
nable to clinical intervention.22-24 On the other hand, lower
educational level is a risk factor for many adverse health out-
comes and could be linked to less access to medical care in
childhood, poorer diet, and other concomitant factors of lower
socioeconomic status, including increased noise exposure.
Our finding of nonsignificance for cardiovascular risk fac-
tors and occupational noise in the fully adjusted model con-
trasts with the report by Agrawal et al.25 This difference can-
not be attributed to sample size (3831 for our study vs 3527 for
the analysis by Agrawal et al25), but could be associated with
bettermedicalmanagementoftheseriskfactorsinrecentyears,
as well as more consistent use of hearing protection in
industry.26-29 Recreational shooting, which often occurs with-
out hearing protection, remains a significant risk factor for
speech-frequency and high-frequency HI, in both the better
and worse ears. In this study, we analyzed lower (<1000 life-
time firearm rounds) and higher (≥1000 lifetime firearm
rounds) gunfire exposure separately and found that only the
higher exposure was associated with HI in the unadjusted and
adjusted analyses (Table 3). Recall bias must be considered in
all these analyses: for example, people who know they have
HI could be more likely to remember and report high levels of
recreational shooting or other use of firearms.
Limitations
One limitation of our study is the necessarily abbreviated
NHANESquestionnairesusedforexposuretooccupationaland
recreational noise as well as other risk factors. One can ques-
tion their adequacy for capturing information on noise expo-
sure across the adult lifespan. We doubt this problem is suf-
ficient to invalidate our findings when comparing results from
NHANES 2011-2012 with 1999-2004,14 since the questions
about noise exposure and other risk factors were similar. An
innovation in the 2011-2012 questionnaire was the distinc-
tion between exposure to loud (“need to speak in a raised voice
to be heard/understood”) vs very loud (“need to shout to be
heard/understood”) noise. Associations by degree and ex-
tent of noise exposure are evident, illustrating face validity be-
tween self-reported exposure and expected increases in preva-
lence and risk estimates.
Age, even after adjustment for other risk factors thought
to be important, has the strongest association with HI, al-
though the Figure suggests a different pattern of age-related
hearing loss for men and women, with earlier age of onset and
more pronounced HI for men. These differences may have a
genetic basis; alternatively, they could be in part attributable,
despite our adjustment for self-reported noise exposure, to
more sustained exposure to higher-intensity noise in men.
Another question regarding the higher prevalence of HI in
men vs women is whether there have been relative changes
during this period: is the gap widening or closing? The overall
prevalenceofspeech-frequencyHIformenwas21.2%(17.9mil-
lion) in 1999-200414 and 18.6% (16.1 million) in 2011-2012

(Table 1), an 11.4% decline. Changes for women were similar:
speech-frequency HI was 10.9% (9.7 million) in 1999-200414
and 9.6% (8.4 million) in 2011-2012, a 12.7% decline. Hence,
there was no difference in relative decline of the prevalence
of HI between men and women.
Conclusions
No intervention has yet been shown to prevent the progres-
sionofage-relatedhearingloss.Hearingaidscanimprovespeech
communication,buttheyarenotusedbymostpeoplewithhear-
ing loss.30,31 Several studies, including in countries that subsi-
dize the cost of hearing aids, have demonstrated many barri-
ers to the use of hearing aids other than cost: self-perceived
disability, self-perceived likelihood of benefit or lack of ben-
efit,andcomfortandappearanceofthehearingaid.32,33Reduc-
ing obstacles to use of hearing aids through educating patients
abouttheimportanceofamplification,traininghealthcarepro-
fessionalstounderstandandovercomepatients’perceivedbar-
riers, improving the quality and affordability of hearing aid de-
vices, and increasing access to hearing health services34-37 are
important public health objectives in view of the high preva-
lence of hearing loss in the US adult population.
