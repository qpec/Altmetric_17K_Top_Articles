Abstract
Recent avian and swine-origin influenza virus outbreaks illustrate the ongoing threat of influ-
enza pandemics. We investigated immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a multi-antigen
(MA) universal influenza DNA vaccine consisting of HA, M2, and NP antigens in cynomolgus
macaques. Following challenge with a heterologous pandemic H1N1 strain, vaccinated ani-
mals exhibited significantly lower viral loads and more rapid viral clearance when compared
to unvaccinated controls. The MA DNA vaccine induced robust serum and mucosal antibody
responses but these high antibody titers were not broadly neutralizing. In contrast, the vac-
cine induced broadly-reactive NP specific T cell responses that cross-reacted with the chal-
lenge virus and inversely correlated with lower viral loads and inflammation. These results
demonstrate that a MA DNA vaccine that induces strong cross-reactive T cell responses
can, independent of neutralizing antibody, mediate significant cross-protection in a nonhu-
man primate model and further supports development as an effective approach to induce
broad protection against circulating and emerging influenza strains.

 Introduction
Influenza is a serious public health issue, and new vaccines are needed to better combat sea-
sonal and pandemic strains. The seasonal vaccine relies primarily on antibody responses
against hemagglutinin (HA) for protection. The currently licensed live-attenuated and inacti-
vated vaccines induce strong HA-specific antibody and afford significant protection against
matched circulating influenza strains however they require annual reformulations to keep
pace with antigenic drift in HA, and a completely new vaccine is needed in the event of an
antigenic shift [1, 2]. Since the manufacture of these vaccines requires 6–9 months from identi-
fication of a new strain to distribution, current vaccines cannot be produced rapidly enough to
protect against wide-scale mortality and morbidity that generally occurs within the first 3
months after the emergence of a new pandemic strain.
Recent efforts have focused on the development of a new generation of influenza vaccines
that could provide broad spectrum, “universal” protection against a wider range of influenza
variants including strains with pandemic potential. DNA vaccines possess a number of charac-
teristics that make them particularly well suited for a universal influenza vaccine [3–6]. In the
event of a pandemic threat, DNA vaccines offer an important advantage of accelerated vaccine
development and production since the DNA vaccine sequences can be obtained directly from
the clinical isolate and rapidly constructed and propagated using well-established molecular
techniques without the need for cell culture or eggs. DNA vaccines induce both antibody and
T cell responses, and both arms of immunity contribute to cross-protection against different
influenza variants [7, 8]. Furthermore, many studies have shown that DNA vaccines are highly
effective in the induction of CD8+ T cell responses that can play a critical role in rapid clear-
ance of influenza virus, thus limiting pathogenesis [9–12] as well as CD4+ T cell responses that
play a key role in maintaining CD8+ T cell memory and providing help for B cells that mediate
rapid antibody production [13, 14].
Early studies showed DNA vaccines were poorly immunogenic in humans [15], but recent
advances show that this poor performance can be overcome, in part, by improvements in vac-
cine delivery and co-delivery of adjuvants [16–18]. In contrast to early DNA vaccines adminis-
tered intramuscularly by needle, DNA administered by electroporation (EP) into the muscle
or by particle-mediated epidermal delivery (PMED or gene gun) into the skin more efficiently
deliver DNA into cells in vivo and have been shown to be capable of inducing strong antibody
and/or T cell responses in most subjects and protective levels of immunity in most [4, 19] or
100% [4, 20] of vaccinated humans without the need for an adjuvant or viral vector/protein
boosting. PMED influenza DNA vaccine clinical trials showed its possible to induce protective
levels of immunity with only a single vaccine dose in humans. Since most of the population
has been either vaccinated or previously exposed to influenza, this outcome is likely due to
boosting memory responses to other H1 subtypes [4, 21]. However EP and PMED-delivered
DNA vaccines are still generally less immunogenic in humans as compared to currently
licensed live-attenuated or protein vaccines containing the same antigens [22–24]. Therefore
additional strategies, such as co-delivery of adjuvants, are being developed to further increase
DNA vaccine potency [6, 15, 25].
Genetic adjuvants are plasmids expressing immune-stimulatory genes that are co-adminis-
tered with DNA vaccines to increase their immunogenicity [26]. The heat-labile enterotoxin
from E. coli (LT) has been shown to be a powerful adjuvant that can be co-administered as a
genetic adjuvant with DNA vaccines [26]. LT and a related adjuvant, cholera toxin (CT), are
members of the AB5 class of bacterial toxins [27]. Parenteral or mucosal administration of
these adjuvants can be toxic. In contrast, administration of LT to the skin of animal and
human subjects is safe, even at high doses (i.e. 500mg) [28]. LT adjuvant activity is mediated in

 part by direct activation of dendritic cells (DCs) and Langerhans cells (LCs) including LCs and
DCs present at cutaneous sites. LT also promotes migration of DCs and LCs to mucosal
immune tissue such as Peyers patches [29–32]. The high concentration of LCs, in the skin
makes LT particularly attractive for enhancing the mucosal and systemic immunogenicity of
vaccines administered via the skin and therefore well-suited to PMED [29, 30, 32]. Consistent
with this notion, we previously showed that co-delivery of a plasmid expressing the A and B
subunits of LT substantially increases DNA vaccine induction of antibody and T cell responses
[26].
A successful universal influenza vaccine will likely need to induce antibody and T-cell
responses against multiple conserved antigens. To this end, we designed an LT adjuvanted,
multi-antigen (LT-MA) DNA vaccine consisting of four HA genes, the ectodomain of M2
(M2e) and the consensus sequence from the highly conserved influenza A nucleoprotein (NP)
[33]. The M2e gene is a 23 amino acid conserved B cell epitope that is poorly immunogenic
[34]. To address this, the M2e gene was fused to a gene encoding the highly immunogenic hep-
atitis core antigen (HBcAg-M2e). This design results in the expression of HBcAg virus like
particles carrying M2e epitopes on their surface [35] and is based on studies employing recom-
binant protein vaccines which have shown that conjugating M2e to HBcAg virus-like particles
enhances M2e immunogenicity [36–38]. Similarly, we previously showed that immunizing
with hybrid DNA vaccines expressing HBcAg virus like particles carrying HIV and SIV B or T
cell epitopes induced stronger responses than DNA vaccines expressing the whole antigen or
the epitopes alone [39, 40].
Each vaccine antigen was expressed and co-delivered on separate plasmids to reduce com-
petition between vectors and maximize epitope expression [8]. The four HA genes consisted of
3 previously circulating seasonal H1, H3, and B strains (H1N1-A/New Caledonia/20/99,
H3N2-A/Panama/2007/99, B/Jiangsu/10/03) and one avian H5N1 influenza virus that has
recently infected humans (H5N1-A/Vietnam/1203/04) [41]. As such, the HA immunogens
included in the LT-MA DNA vaccine mimic the composition of a seasonal influenza vaccine.
Similar to currently marketed vaccines, HA DNA vaccines induce strong antibody responses
against the highly variable HA head that do not contribute to cross-protection. However, HA
DNA vaccines have been shown to also induce cross-protective antibody responses against the
more conserved stem region of HA [42, 43].
Here, we investigated immunogenicity and protective efficacy of an LT-adjuvanted multi-
antigen (LT-MA) universal influenza DNA vaccine consisting of HA, M2, and NP antigens in
cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) that have been used as a preclinical model that
closely resembles human immunology and physiology to study vaccine and antiviral efficacy
against highly pathogenic human and avian influenza viruses [44–47]. Here, we show that a 3
vaccinations of an LT-adjuvanted DNA vaccine administered 6 weeks apart was able to induce
a high titered antibody response. In addition, we show that the adjuvanted DNA vaccine
induced mucosal responses and potent, cross-reactive T cell responses that correlate with
lower viral loads and less inflammation. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using an
adjuvanted universal influenza DNA vaccine for broad protection against drifted and shifted
strains of influenza with pandemic potential.

 are often less effective in humans. The nonhuman primate more closely resembles humans in
size, physiology and immune response. We therefore investigated the ability of the LT-MA
DNA vaccine to induce antibody and T cell responses in cynomolgus monkeys. To reduce
competition between the vectors, each DNA vaccine vector was coated onto separate gold par-
ticles with the LT adjuvant at a 10:1 DNA vaccine to adjuvant ratio and then the gold beads
were mixed prior to immunization into the skin with PMED. Since PMED results in most cells
receiving a single gold bead, this strategy eliminates competition in the expression of multiple
plasmids in the same cell. We previously showed this formulation results in expression of each
vaccine plasmid in separate cells and induction of immune responses that are comparable to
levels induced when immunizing with each plasmid separately [8]. In mice and ferrets, we pre-
viously showed that this vaccine induced comparable antibody titers against all 4 HA plasmids
included in the vaccine [53]. Macaques received 3 immunizations with the LT-MA DNA vac-
cine spaced 6 weeks apart. Two weeks after each dose, blood was collected and serum IgG
responses were measured by ELISA. After only a single immunization, IgG responses against
each component of the vaccine (HA, NP, and M2e) were detected. Antibody responses against
each antigen were boosted after the second dose but titers remained unchanged following the
third dose in all 8 influenza-naïve animals (Fig 1A).
Mucosal IgG responses in the bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) were measured against M2e,
NP and a representative HA antigen H1N1-A/New Caledonia/20/99 (NC99) by ELISA. Muco-
sal IgG responses were detectable two weeks after the first vaccine dose, increased significantly
following the second dose and, in contrast to the serum IgG antibodies, were further boosted
following the third dose in 6 of 8 vaccinated macaques (Fig 1B). Therefore, the PMED

 delivered LT-MA DNA vaccine induced HA, M2e and NP-specific mucosal antibody in addi-
tion to systemic antibody responses, a result that is consistent with our previous findings
showing that PMED induces both mucosal and systemic immune responses in nonhuman pri-
mates [8, 54, 55].
HA-specific neutralizing antibody responses were measured by hemagglutinin inhibition
(HI) assay which measures neutralizing antibodies against the HA head region. The LT-MA
DNA vaccine induced HI antibody titers that greatly exceeded the minimum required for pro-
tection in humans (HI titer of 40). HI titers exceeded protective levels in 5/8 (62.5%) macaques
after a single dose and in all 8 (100%) macaques after a third dose (Fig 1C). Significantly, 6 of
these 8 animals developed robust HI titers that exceeded 1,000. These results confirm our pre-
vious findings in nonhuman primates showing that 3 doses of PMED DNA vaccination alone,
without the need for boosting with recombinant protein or viral vectors, can induce antibody
titers that greatly exceed protective levels of immunity [8].
To determine if these strong antibody responses were broadly neutralizing, sera from vacci-
nated macaques were analyzed for the ability to neutralize homologous and heterologous H1
influenza strains in vitro. Consistent with the HI analysis, the sera neutralized the H1N1 virus
that is homologous to the H1N1 HA immunogen included in the vaccine (NC99) (Fig 1D).
However, there was no detectable cross-neutralization of two heterologous H1N1 viruses, A/
PR/8/34 (PR8) or A/California/07/09 (CA09), which respectively share 89% and 80% sequence
identity to the H1N1 vaccine strain NC99 (Fig 1D). These results indicate that the LT-MA
DNA vaccine was able to elicit significant levels of neutralizing HA-specific antibodies in the
serum of immunized macaques against a matching strain of influenza but not against geneti-
cally distinct or shifted strains of influenza.
LT-MA DNA vaccine induces strong cross-reactive T cell responses in
nonhuman primates
To measure induction of cellular immune responses induced in the blood by the vaccine, we
performed IFN-γ Elispot assays using pools of overlapping peptides comprising the entire
amino acid sequence of HA, NP and M2e of the heterologous pandemic swine origin challenge
strain, CA09 (H1N1). Modest cross-reactive IFN-γ responses were observed 2 weeks after the
first vaccine dose, with a robust boost in magnitude after the second vaccine dose. The third
vaccine dose did not increase mean IFN-γ responses, but responses were clearly boosted in
those animals that exhibited low responses after the second dose (data not shown). All 8 animals
(100%) exhibited strong cross-reactive IFN-γ responses against the heterologous challenge
strain (CA09 peptides) following the third dose (Fig 2A). The cellular responses observed were
largely directed against HA and NP antigens, with only 4 of 8 animals generating M2e-reactive
T cells (Fig 2A and 2B). However, all 8 vaccinated animals generated broadly reactive cellular
responses to multiple HA and NP peptide pools (Fig 2B), and IFN-γ responses were signifi-
cantly higher in the vaccinated animals when compared to responses in the unvaccinated, con-
trol animals, p = 0.0008 (Fig 2C).
Protection from heterologous influenza challenge
Three weeks post final vaccination (week 15), control and vaccinated macaques (N = 8
macaques per group) were challenged with 107.4 plague forming units (PFU) of the heterolo-
gous H1N1 A/California/04/2009 (CA09) virus through a combination of intratracheal, intra-
nasal, ocular and oral routes to mimic the routes humans are naturally infected with influenza
[44]. CA09 is a highly virulent Group 1 pandemic influenza strain that shares 80% amino acid
sequence identity to the closest related HA immunogen used in the vaccine (H1N1 NC99) so

 the heterologous challenge with CA09 mimics vaccination against a seasonal strain and subse-
quent exposure to an unmatched pandemic strain. Infection of cynomolgus macaques with
CA09 has been previously shown to result in efficient replication of the virus in the lungs caus-
ing mild lung lesions and an influx of inflammatory infiltrates [44].
To assess the effects of the vaccine on protection, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples
were collected at various time points post-challenge and analyzed for viral load by semi-quan-
titative Taqman reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). The viral RNA titers in the control
group were significantly higher than the vaccinated group at both days 3 and 7 post-challenge
(p < 0.0079) (Fig 3A). At day 3, three macaques per group were necropsied and the right lung
was collected and fixed in neutral buffered formalin to investigate the effects of vaccination on
viral replication, tissue damage and inflammation in lung tissues. In situ hybridization for
influenza virus RNAs was performed on the right accessory (Fig 3B), and the right caudal lung
lobes (Fig 3C). We observed lower viral RNA expression in the lungs of vaccinated macaques
when compared to controls for both the right accessory and right caudal lung lobes. These
results show that the LT-MA DNA vaccine reduced pulmonary viral loads and accelerated
viral clearance demonstrating significant protection from the heterologous challenge. Data
shown are representative of the signals observed for each tissue section as whole.

 Vaccinated macaques displayed more rapid response and less
inflammation
Influenza infection results in the induction of inflammatory responses that lead to tissue dam-
age and disease. To determine if the LT-MA DNA vaccine protected from induction of inflam-
matory responses post-challenge, a multiplex cytokine analysis was performed on BAL
samples to assess soluble factors present in the lungs of the macaques at 3, 7, 11, and 21 days
after heterologous challenge. As expected, all cytokines influenced by the infection peaked at
days 3 or 7 post-infection (Fig 4A) and declined to near baseline levels by the later timepoints
(data not shown). Importantly, T-cell activating cytokine IL-2 was significantly elevated in the
vaccinated animals during acute infection when compared to the controls (p = 0.0264), as was
leukocyte chemoattractant RANTES (p = 0.0430) (Fig 4A), which is produced by epithelial

 cells in response to influenza infection in order to recruit leukocytes to the site of infection
[56]. On the other hand, Eotaxin, MIG, IL-6 and TNF-α, which are pro-inflammatory and
chemoattractant responses that are induced by influenza infection, peaked early in the vacci-
nated group at 3 days post infection but then declined by 7 days post infection. This is in con-
trast to the control group, where these inflammatory cytokine responses continued to increase
or stay elevated between 3–7 days post infection (Fig 4A). These results indicate inflammatory
responses were more rapidly resolved in the vaccinated animals than in the controls, an out-
come that is consistent with the vaccine mediating more rapid viral clearance and reduced
lung inflammation.
To confirm these findings, three animals from each treatment group were sacrificed at 3
days post infection to assess lung pathology and immune cell infiltrates (S2 Table and S4 Fig).
Flow cytometric phenotypic analysis of leukocytes isolated from lung tissue revealed signifi-
cantly more CD8+ T lymphocytes present in the lungs of vaccinated macaques as compared to
controls (p = 0.018, Fig 4B). Statistical significance was difficult to achieve with an n-value of
only three animals per group necropsied at this time point. However, the vaccinated animals
appeared to have similar levels of CD4+ T lymphocyte and CD20+ B lymphocyte infiltration,
and decreased CD14+/CD11b+ macrophage recruitment as compared to unvaccinated control
animals (Fig 4B and 4D). These data support the hypothesis that the LT-MA DNA vaccine
induced local mucosal CD8+ T reponses that rapidly recalled in response to challenge, result-
ing in reduced viral replication and decreased lung inflammation.
Protection from influenza is mediated by T cell responses
We next investigated immune correlates of protection. The DNA vaccine induced strong
cross-reactive T cell responses against the challenge strain, but we were unable to detect

 broadly neutralizing antibody responses. To further investigate if antibodies contributed to
protection, we passively transferred purified IgG from vaccinated and control macaques to
naive mice (25 mg/animal) by intraperitoneal (IP) injection 24 hours before lethal challenge
with the mouse-adapted CA09 virus. The mouse-adapted CA09 virus leads to rapid weight loss
and death in mice within 5–8 days post-infection [57]. IgG was purified from sera collected
from vaccinated and control macaques before the first vaccine dose (Baseline, week 0), 3 weeks
after final vaccine dose but before challenge (Vaccination, week 15) and 3 weeks after the chal-
lenge (Control, week 18) and (Vaccinated, week 18). Naive mice (PBS) received PBS by IP
injection 24 hours before CA09 challenge and as expected, lost greater than 25% of their weight
and were euthanized within 6–8 days. Similarly, mice that received IgG purified from sera col-
lected from either control or vaccinated animals before the first vaccine dose (week 0) or after
the final dose (week 15) succumbed within 7–8 days post-challenge (Fig 5A). As expected, IgG
purified from sera collected post-challenge (week 18) with CA09 after strong HI titers against
the challenge virus arose, protected mice from lethal CA09 challenge (Fig 5A). These results
confirm that although the LT-MA DNA vaccine induced robust neutralizing antibody
responses against the homologous vaccine immunogens, these responses did not contribute to
protection against the heterologous virus challenge.
To investigate the contribution of T cell responses to protection, we analyzed the magni-
tude, function and specificity of T cell responses that developed in response to CA09 three
weeks post-challenge in vaccinated and control macaques. Analysis of the magnitude by IFN-γ
ELISPOT against CA-09-specific HA, NP and M2e peptide pools revealed significantly ele-
vated cumulative IFN-γ responses post-challenge in the vaccinated animals when compared to
the controls (total responses, p < 0.05) with the greatest proportion of cross-reactive IFN-γ
responses directed against NP peptide pools (p < 0.02, 2-way ANOVA) (Fig 5B, orange and
red boxes). These results indicate that the DNA vaccine primed for robust recall T cell
responses against the heterologous CA09 challenge strain.
To determine the effects of the DNA vaccine on T cell function, intracellular cytokine stain-
ing was used to analyze magnitude, specificity and characterize function of T cell responses in
response to stimulation with CA09 peptides. Gating scheme and representative positive and
negative controls can be found in S1 Fig Vaccination increased the breadth and polyfunction-
ality of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells when compared to the controls (Fig 5C and 5D),
although the total magnitude of responding cells was unaltered (S2 Fig). Specifically, vaccina-
tion significantly increased NP-specific CD4+ cells expressing TNF-α+/IL-2+/IFNγ+
(p = 0.008), TNF-α+/IL-2+ (p = 0.048), and IL-2+ (p = 0.008) at week 14 (S3 Fig). Following
challenge, the vaccinated animals demonstrated more polyfunctional effector T cell responses
than control animals at 11 days post infection (Fig 5C and 5D). Interestingly, both CD8+ and
CD4+ HA-specific cells expressing TNF-α+/IL-2+ (p = 0.048, p = 0.016) were increased in the
vaccinated animals compared to controls, as well as NP-specific CD4+ cells expressing TNF-
α+/IL-2+ (p = 0.032) (S3 Fig). These results show that the DNA vaccine induced polyfunctional
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, expressing IFN-γ, TNF, and IL-2 that have been shown to mediate
better protection than monofunctional T cells expressing a single cytokine [8].
Vaccination augments the acute response to viral challenge
To further probe the impact of PMED vaccination on the host response to viral challenge, we
analyzed the BAL-associated genome-wide transcriptional responses at days 3, 7, and 10 post-
challenge. Differential gene expression was detected by day 3 following heterologous challenge
and continued to increase throughout the course of infection in the control group (Fig 6A;
left). Host gene expression at 3 days post challenge was more robust in vaccinated macaques

 than in control macaques (Fig 6A; right), which is demonstrated by the degree to which
expression of differentially expressed (DE) genes deviate the most from expression prior to
challenge. Vaccination led to a rapid change in gene expression, which was not observed until
later timepoints (days 7 and 10) in the control group (Fig 6B). No DE genes were observed at
days 7 and 10 post-challenge in vaccinated macaques, when host transcriptional profiles were
found to approximate those observed pre-challenge, a result that is consistent with the
observed decreases in viral burden and rapid viral clearance observed in vaccinated macaques
relative to control macaques (Fig 3).

 In both groups, the early response (day 3) to challenge was associated with the induction of
pattern recognition receptor and interferon-mediated antiviral responses in both control and
vaccinated animals (Fig 6C). However, responses in the controls were distinguished by inflam-
mation-associated pathways that are consistent with the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis
(ES = 7.978), hypercytokinemia and hyperchemokinemia in the pathogenesis of influenza
(ES = 6.65), and NF-κB signaling (ES = 2.79), and these patterns were enhanced relative to that
observed in the vaccinated animals (ES = 4.892, 2.051, and no significant enrichment; respec-
tively). On the other hand, vaccination resulted in greater IL-6 responses that are important
for the resolution of influenza-mediated inflammation [58] and the coordination of optimal T
cell responses to influenza infection [59]. Lastly, given the observed elevated IFN-γ (Fig 5) and
IL-6 responses with T cell recall responses [60], we further evaluated the impact of vaccination
on gene expression associated with the recruitment of leukocytes and lymphocytes into the

 infected lung and found that the day 3 vaccine transcriptional signatures were consistent with
an increase in T lymphocyte recruitment, and cytotoxic T cell stimulation (Fig 6D). The vacci-
nated transcriptional profiles were also predictive of decreased infiltration of myeloid cells,
granulocytes, and neutrophils that contribute to inflammation and disease. These data demon-
strate that vaccination results in the induction of a robust antiviral response while limiting the
recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes [61–64], which is largely coordinated by T cells,
thereby limiting viral replication and tissue damage.
Protection from influenza correlates with NP-specific T cell responses
To determine if the magnitude or specificity of pre- or post-challenge T cell responses correlate
with protection, we compared T cell responses measured by IFN-γ ELISPOT after the final
DNA vaccine dose at 3 weeks post-challenge to viral loads measured 3 days post-infection. The
results in Fig 7A show a significant inverse correlation between the viral loads and the NP-spe-
cific IFN-γ T cell responses measured only after the final DNA vaccination (p = 0.0161, r =
-0.8501) but not 3 weeks post-challenge (P = 0.2134, r = 0.-6727) (data not shown). In contrast
there was no statistically significant correlation between the viral load and the magnitude of
HA-specific or M2e-specific IFN-γ T cell responses measured post-vaccination or 3 weeks
post-challenge (Fig 7A and 7C). We also compared antibody responses measured by ELISA or
HIA, monofunctional and polyfunctional T cell responses, cytokine responses measured at
week 15 by Bio-Plex, and overall frequency of CD4+, CD8+, B cell and macrophage present in
the lung at week 15 by immunophenotyping and observed no statistically significant correla-
tions (not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that vaccine-induced NP-specific
IFN-γ T cell responses provided a primary mechanism of protection in this study.
Discussion
Neutralizing antibodies mediate effective protection against influenza, and it is generally
expected that a successful universal influenza vaccine that protects against both seasonal anti-
genic drift and emerging influenza pandemics will likely need to induce both broadly neutral-
izing antibody to blunt initial viral replication and cross-reactive CD8+ T cell responses to
help clear the cells that become infected. Here, we show in a preclinical nonhuman primate
model that an adjuvanted DNA vaccine expressing multiple antigens (HA, M2e and NP)
induced very high antibody titers and robust cross-reactive T cell responses but failed to
induce broadly neutralizing antibody. Nevertheless, this vaccine was still able to exert signifi-
cant cross-strain protection, including both early blunting of viremia and accelerated viral

 clearance, that; correlated with T cell responses, against a challenge with a heterologous pan-
demic H1N1 strain that shares 85% identity with the most similar H1N1 HA antigen included
in the vaccine.
DNA vaccines generally induce modest or low antibody responses when compared to other
vaccine modalities [3]. To address this deficiency, DNA vaccines have been combined with
other types of vaccines, such as live viral vectors or recombinant proteins in a prime-boost reg-
imen that results in a synergistic induction of robust antibody that is higher than levels
induced by either vaccine alone [42, 43, 65]. DNA vaccine priming also appears to expand the
antibody epitope repertoire, increase affinity maturation and direct development of T cells
with effector memory phenotypes [66–69]. The generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies
by heterologous prime-boost regimens was previously found to be dependent on the DNA
priming, and the hypothesis emerging from these studies is that the DNA vaccine increases the
number and diversity of the CD4+ and B cell clones [42, 70] while the protein or viral vector
boosting is needed to expand these clones to get to a threshold titer that can afford cross-strain
protection. Here, using a potent genetic adjuvant and highly efficient DNA vaccine delivery
technology, we achieved robust induction of homologous HA-specific antibody responses
against the strains included in the vaccine with DNA alone (titers > 1:1000). These titers sub-
stantially exceeded protective levels in humans (1:40) and were comparable in magnitude to
levels previously reported to be induced by DNA priming followed by heterologous protein or
viral vectored vaccines [42, 71]. However, despite achieving very high titers, DNA vaccination
alone did not induce broadly neutralizing antibodies,. This contrasts to previous work showing
that an influenza DNA vaccine prime followed by a boost with either a replication defective
Ad5 vector encoding the same HA or the seasonal influenza vaccine induced broadly neutral-
izing antibodies targeting conserved HA stalk in mice, ferrets and non-human primates [42].
Our study shows it’s possible for a DNA vaccine alone to achieve high titered antibody
responses on par with heterologous prime-boost regimens [72, 73] but these responses were
not broadly neutralizing. The mechansims underlying the synergy between DNA vaccines and
protein or viral vectored vaccines in heterologous prime-boost regimens are still unknown.
Our results suggest that while DNA vaccines can prime for broadly specific antibody and T
cell repertoire, the diverse antigen presentation pathway provided by a heterologous prime-
boost regimen may be key to expand these responses. Recent studies demonstrate the feasibil-
ity of inducing even broader neutralizing antibody by using immunogens that present only the
HA stalk or by sequential immunization with chimeric vaccines consisting of divergent heads
but the same stalk. Such immunogens could be expressed in our DNA vaccine platform result-
ing in a potent universal influenza vaccine capable of inducing high titered broadly neutraliz-
ing antibody and cross-protective T cell responses in a single vaccine modality.
Three doses were employed in this study but we previously showed that PMED delivery of
a single dose of an HA DNA vaccine induced protective levels of antibody against a matching
strain in humans [4, 5], likely due to the HA DNA vaccine boosting responses that were
primed by previous exposures to influenza or prior vaccinations. For HA DNA vaccines
designed to match circulating strains, rapid manufacture would provide an advantage over
existing vaccines that require 6–9 months to produce. Here, our goal was to determine if incor-
porating conserved viral antigens into a representative seasonal HA DNA vaccine could pro-
vide broader protection against unmatched strains. Since these antigens are conserved, they
would not be constrained to the same short manufacturing or distribution window that the
more variable HA antigens are and could be manufactured and administered to the population
prior to the flu season or concurrently with the seasonal vaccine as we performed in this study.
We employed a multi-dose regimen because multiple doses over a longer window of time
induce more durable immunity which is the goal of a universal influenza vaccine. Our results

 show that the PMED LT-MA DNA vaccine alone was able to induce robust T cells that were
broad in specificity with the ability to cross-react to a variety of sequences and antigens in a
heterologous influenza strain. This result is consistent with our previous studies showing an
adjuvanted HA DNA vaccine administered by PMED induced broadly specific T cell
responses against multiple sequences in HA and administration of a therapeutic PMED DNA
vaccine induced broadly specific T cell responses in SIV-infected macaques that correlated
with improved viral control [26, 74].
Significant T cell responses were induced after only 1–2 doses in all animals, suggesting that
cross-protective T cell immunity by this vaccine could potentially be achieved with fewer
doses, especially in individuals that may be primed for these responses by previous exposure to
influenza. Additional studies will be needed to determine the minimum doses needed to
induce cross-protection by this vaccine. Studies in mice and humans have shown that in the
absence of effective antibody-mediated protection, T cell responses do not prevent or blunt the
initial infection but can mediate accelerated clearance of an established infection and reduce
inflammation [75]. Consistent with these observations, a previous study in nonhuman pri-
mates showed that a DNA vaccine that induced strong systemic T cell responses but not neu-
tralizing antibody afforded mild protection against a heterosubtypic influenza challenge in
that there was no reduction in peak viral shedding at days 3–5 but enhanced viral clearance
later in the course of the infection [76]. In contrast, the adjuvanted DNA vaccine in our study
not only enhanced clearance of the infection but provided significant early blunting of acute
viral replication within the first 3 days post-infection that is more similar to the expected
effects of antibody. Concurrent with this effect, we also observed rapid recall T cell responses
post-challenge, an early influx of CD8+ T cells into the lung and early induction of the pro-
inflammatory cytokines in vaccinated macaques compared to controls that correlated with
dampened recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes, reduced viral replication and protection
from lung tissue damage. These results show the DNA vaccine was able to induce a robust
early antiviral response that blunted acute viremia in the lung very early in infection. Since we
detected no neutralizing antibody against the challenge strain but strong cross-reactive T cell
responses and rapid influx of CD8+ T cells to the lung post-challenge, these results suggest
cross-reactive local effector T cell responses induced by the vaccine likely blunted the acute
viremia at the mucosal site of viral exposure. Consistent with this possibility, a previous study
in nonhuman primates showed that mucosal exposure to subpathogenic doses of influenza
virus induces lung resident influenza-specific T cells that mediated a similar blunting of acute
viremia in the lung when animals were subsequently challenged with a high dose heterosubty-
pic pandemic strain of influenza [75].
Taken together, our results demonstrate that an LT-MA DNA vaccine induced mucosal
and systemic antibody responses against the vaccine strains and robust cross-reactive T cell
responses that even in the complete absence of broadly neutralizing antibody can still mediate
robust heterologous protection from a highly divergent strain of influenza. These results make
a strong case for generating a universal influenza vaccine that induces cross-reactive T cell
responses to enhance existing antibody-based modalities. A universal influenza DNA vaccine
that induces robust cross-reactive T cell responses against influenza antigens, in addition to
strong antibody responses against homologous strains, could provide an important alternative
to existing influenza vaccines by providing antibody-mediated protection against seasonal
strains of influenza and at the same time, inducing T cell responses that could provide added
protection against emerging or unexpected pandemics.

 Materials and methods
Research animals and ethics statement
All animal experiments used in this study were approved by the University of Washington
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol# 4266–02), and in were in compli-
ance with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals and Animal Welfare Act. This study used n = 16 male cynomolgus
macaques (Macaca fascicularis) between the ages of 4 and 6 (average 5). All animals were pre-
screened for cross-reactive antibody to influenza antigens prior to enrollment in the study.
Animals were singly housed in comfortable, clean, adequate-sized cage. Cages, racks, and
accessories were sanitized in mechanical cage washers at least once every two weeks and waste
pans are cleaned daily. Temperature in animal quarters was maintained at 72–82˚F. Animals
were fed a commercial monkey chow, supplemented daily with fruits and vegetables and
drinking water was available at all times provided by automatic watering devices. Throughout
the study, animals were checked twice daily by the veterinary technicians to evaluate their
physical and clinical condition. Environmental enrichment activities included grooming con-
tact, perches, toys, foraging experiences and access to additional environment enrichment
devices such as paint rollers, grooming devices, foraging devices, activity panels and mirrors.
All procedures were performed either under ketamine sedation (10 mg/kg) or Telazol 2.5-
10mg/kg to minimize pain. Euthanasia prior to necropsy was performed by administration
Euthanol1 (Virbac Corp., Houston, TX) while the animal was under deep anesthesia in
accordance with guidelines established by the 2007 American Veterinary Medical Association
Guidelines on Euthanasia which is consistent with the guidelines described in the Weatherall
Report on The Use of Nonhuman Primates in Research. None of the animals became severely
ill during the course of the study and none required euthanasia prior to their experimental
endpoint.
Plasmid construction and vaccine formulation
Codon optimized coding sequences for the hemagglutinin antigens, and a NP consensus
sequence determined by alignment of the NP protein sequences of H1N1-A/New Caledo-
nia/20/99, H3N2-A/Panama/2007/99, and H5N1-A/Vietnam/1203/04 were designed and
constructed by GeneArt. The coding sequences were inserted into the Nhe1 and Bgl2 sites
of PJV7563 [8], an empty DNA vaccine expression plasmid. HBcAg-M2e was constructed
by inserting oligonucleotides that code for M2e into the Bsp120I site of plasmid PJV7063
[40], resulting in a plasmid that expresses a fusion of M2e in the immunodominant loop of
HBcAg. The construction of the LT plasmid is described elsewhere [77]. Plasmid DNA was
precipitated onto 1–3 μM gold particles as previously described [22] at a rate of 1.8 μg of
each antigen plasmid and 0.2 μg LT adjuvant plasmid (10:1 ratio of DNA vaccine to adju-
vant) per 1.0mg of gold. This study was investigated in 2 cohorts (Vaccinated and Control)
of cynomolgus macaques with N = 8 animals per cohort. Each cohort consisted of 4 animals
from each of the 2 treatment groups (total of N = 8 animals/group). Animals were stratified
to provide comparable distribution of weight and age into each group. Animals (Vacci-
nated group n = 8) were sedated, the leg and abdominal fur was clipped, and DNA-coated
gold particles were accelerated into the skin of the abdominal and inguinal regions using a
gene gun PMED device. DNA-coated gold particles were delivered at a helium pressure of
45 bar psi. Each actuation resulted in the delivery of 2 μg of DNA into the epidermis. A sin-
gle dose consisted of 16 actuations for a sum of 32 μg. Each dose was administered 6 weeks
apart.

 Producton of H1N1 Influenza A Virus
Sub-confluent MDCK cell monolayers in T75 flasks were washed and inoculated with 2ml
serum-free MEM containing 0.5 multiplicity of infection (MOI) A/California/07/2009 (CA09)
H1N1 Influenza A Virus obtained from J.T. Weinfurter (Wisconsin Primate Center, UW
Madison) for 1 hour at 37˚C/5% CO2 [75]. The virus and cell inoculum was rocked every 15
minutes to avoid drying of the monolayer and then 18 ml additional medium was added to
each flask and the culture medium was harvested at 36 hours post-infection. Cell debris was
pelleted at 200rpm for 10min at 4˚C, and then filter-sterilized through a 0.22micron filter.
Virus stock was frozen at -80˚C in 1ml aliquots, and titered by plaque assay on MDCK cells.
Experimental challenge of cynomolgus macaques with influenza virus
Eight macaques per group (Vaccinated and Control) were intramuscularly anaesthetized with
ketamine (10 mg/kg) and inoculated with a suspension containing 106.5 p.f.u. ml-1 of CA09
virus through a combination of intratracheal (4.5 ml), intranasal (0.5 ml per nostril), ocular
(0.1 ml per eye) and oral (1 ml) routes (resulting in a total infectious dose of 107.4 PFU).
Macaques were monitored daily for clinical signs of disease including, sneezing, nasal dis-
charge, weight loss and activity level. On days 0, 3, 7, 10 and 21 after infection, nasal and tra-
cheal swabs and bronchial brush samples were collected. On day 3 after infection, 3 macaques
per group were necropsied for virological and pathological examinations.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
HA-specific IgG antibody levels in mouse and macaque serum and bronchioalveolar lavage
(BAL) were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Maxisorp plates
(Thermo Scientific-Nunc) were coated with 100 ng/well of recombinant A/New Caledonia/20/
99 (Protein Sciences), M2e (Selleck Chemical), or NP in PBS overnight at 4˚C. NP protein was
made in E. coli using a his-tagged protein and nickel resin for purification. Plates were blocked
with 5% nonfat milk powder in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, and then washed three times
with wash buffer (PBS-T; phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20). Three-fold
serial dilutions of samples were added to the wells starting at a dilution of 1:500, and plates
were incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. Following three washes with PBS-T, plates were
incubated with horseradish-peroxidase conjugated goat anti-macaque IgG (1/5,000 dilution)
secondary antibodies (Nordic Immunological Laboratories) for 1 hr at room temperature.
After five washes with PBS-T, TMB substrate (KPL) was added to the wells for 30 min at room
temperature. Color development was stopped by the addition of TMB Stop solution (KPL),
and the plates were read at 450 nm. Antibody endpoint titers were calculated by nonlinear
regression analysis of curves using GraphPad Prism and were determined to be two standard
deviations above the baseline.
Hemagglutinin inhibition assay
RDE (Accurate Chemical & Scientific Corp.) treated macaque sera were analyzed for the pres-
ence of influenza A/New Caledonia/20/99 specific antibody using a hemagglutination inhibi-
tion (HI) assay as described [5]. Briefly, two-fold serial dilutions of RDE-treated sera were
incubated with 4 hemagglutination units of influenza A/New Caledonia/20/99 virus. After 30
min at room temperature, 50 μl of 0.5% turkey RBCs (Lampire Biological Laboratories) sus-
pended in PBS was added to each well and incubated for an additional 30 minutes. Serum HAI
titers are reported from the average of duplicate tests as the reciprocal dilution of serum found
to inhibit hemagglutination.

 Neutralization assay
Neutralization assays were performed using the PB1flank-eGFP viruses as previously described
[78]. Briefly, macaque serum was heat inactivated at 56˚C for 1 hr, then five-fold diluted in a
96-well plate, and virus was added at an MOI that ranged from 0.1 to 0.8 for the different
viruses. Plates were incubated at 37˚C for 1 hr to allow antibody binding, and then 4 × 104
MDCK-SIAT1-CMV-PB1 cells were added per well. After an 18-hr incubation, GFP fluores-
cence intensity was measured using an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wave-
length of 515 nm. Values are reported as percent infectivity remaining averaged over triplicate
measurements.
Passive transfer studies
Sera from vaccinated and control macaques were collected at week 0 (Baseline, vaccinated and
control macaques before vaccination and challenge, n = 16), week 15 (Pre-Vaccinated, sera
from vaccinated macaques pre-challenge only, n = 8), week 18 (Post-Vaccinated, sera from
vaccinated macaques post-challenge, n = 5) and week 18 (Post-Controls, sera from control
macaques post-challenge, n = 5). IgG from immune sera was purified with protein G (Life
Technologies) using the manufacturer’s protocol. Female BALB/c mice (n = 10/group)
received saline (Ctr) or 25 mg/animal of either Baseline, Pre-Vaccinated, Post-Vaccinated or
Post-Control IgG via an intraperitoneal route. 24 hrs post passive transfer mice were challenge
with a lethal dose (10 times the 50% mouse lethal dose or 10 MLD50) of the mouse adapted
H1N1 A/California/04/2009 (CA09) virus [57]. The mice were monitored daily for weight loss
and survival until 14 days post-infection. Animals that lost more than 30% of their initial body
weight were euthanized by carbon dioxide in accordance with our animal protocols.
Isolation of mononuclear cells from blood
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated by Ficoll density centrifugation.
Erythrocytes were removed using ACK lysis buffer (BioWhittaker) and remaining cells washed
with RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.
ELISPOT
PBMC’s were stimulated in duplicate at 2e5 and 1e5 cells per well with 10 individual peptide
pools (1μg/mL each peptide) spanning the full amino acid sequences of HA, NP, and M2e. HA
and NP peptides were 15-mers overlapping by 11 amino acids (BEI Resources), M2e peptides
were 10-mers overlapping by 9 (Mimotopes). Each pool contained 14–27 individual peptides
and sequentially spanned the entire protein. Concanavalin A (Sigma) was used as a positive
stimulation control (5μg/mL). DMSO served as a negative solvent control. Antigen-specific T
cells secreting IFN-γ were detecting using paired anti-macaque IFN-γ monoclonal antibodies
(U-cytech-BV) as previously described. Spot forming cells (SFC) were enumerated using an
Immunospot Analyzer with CTL Immunospot Profession Software (Cellular Technology
Ltd.). Results are expressed as the mean number of SFC in replicate wells containing antigenic
peptide, subtracting the number of spots from DMSO control wells from the same animal.
Intracellular Cytokine Staining (ICS)
Cryopreserved PBMC’s were thawed and rested for four hours and 1.2 million cells were stim-
ulated with DMSO, Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), or peptides (1 μg/mL) each for 1 hour
with CD107a/b FITC (H4A3/H4B4, BD) in serum free fully defined AIM V1 (Thermo-
Firsher1) media prior to adding 1 mg/mL of Brefeldin A. Cells were stimulated in the

stained using a LIVE/DEAD1 Yellow (ThermoFisher1) amine dye then surface stained with
CD3 V500 (Sp34-2, BD Biosciences), CD4 PerCPCy5.5 (L200, BD Biosciences), CD8
APC-Cy7 (RPA-T8, BD Biosciences), CD28 PE-CF594 (CD28.2, BD Biosciences), CD95

body concentrations. Cells were then washed with Perm/WashTM Buffer (BD Bioscinces) then
fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) and collected on an LSR II (BD Bioscinces). Flow
cytometry was analyzed in FlowJo (Version 9.7.6, Treestar Inc., Ashland, Oregon). See S1 Fig
for gating and representative positive and negative controls. Graphs represent background
(DMSO) subtracted stimulations. A minimum of 100,000 viable T cells were collected for each
stimulation.

Viral titers by real-time RT-PCR
Viral loads were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples by semi-quantitative real-
time RT-PCR using the CDC protocol for swine influenza A (H1N1) (kit obtained from BEI
Repository NR-15577) [79]. Briefly, RNA was extracted from BAL samples using a modified
version of the Invitrogen PureLink Viral RNA/DNA kit (cat. # 12280–050). Semi-quantitative
RT-PCR was performed using Invitrogen SuperScript III Platinum One-Step Quantitative Kit
and Swine Influenza H1 (swH1) primers and probe from the BEI kit. A standard curve was
generated by extracting RNA from 10-fold dilutions of CA09 virus of known chicken egg
infectious dose 50 (CEID50). The relative CEID50 of unknown NHP samples were back calcu-
lated by comparison with CT values from this standard curve and are expressed as CEID50
equivalents/ml. No template and positive (a sample from a prior experiment) template controls
were included in each PCR run.
In situ hybridization for influenza virus RNAs
In situ hybridization (ISH) was performed using 35S-labeled riboprobes to detect influenza
virus RNAs in sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung tissues as described (Fallert
2002 J Virol Methods; Reinhart 2002 Blood). Following stringent hybridization and washing,

3'; and H1N1 Cal 2009 seg5 NP reverse, 5’-CAT TTT CAC CCC TCC AGA AA-3’.
RT-PCR was performed using total RNA prepared from infected cells as template for cDNA
synthesis followed by PCR. The resulting PCR products were agarose gel purified, ligated to
pGEM-T vector (Promega) and DNA sequenced. The resulting cDNA-containing plasmids
were linearized by restriction digestion and used as template for in vitro transcription to gen-
erate sense and anti-sense riboprobes.
Bio-Plex analysis of cytokine production in BAL
The concentrations of cytokines in the lung were measured by analyzing BAL on days 0, 3, 7,
11 and 21 days post-infection. The levels of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, interferon (IFN)-γ, and
tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, RANTES, Eotaxin, and MIG in the lysate were measured
using a Bio-Plex multiplex bead array kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The Bio-Plex assay was per-
formed in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
RNA isolation and microarray processing
Bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) were collected two weeks prior to challenge and at days 3, 7,
and 10 post infection from animals in both the control and vaccinated group. Total RNA was
isolated from BAL using Trizol and fluorescently labeled probes were generated from each
sample using Agilent one-color LowInput Quick Amp Labeling Kit (Agilent Technologies).
Individual cRNA samples were hybridized to oligonucleotide microarrays for gene expression
profiling using Macaque 8x60K Custom Microarray Kit (G4102A; Agilent Technologies).
RNA isolated from pre-challenge animals served as an uninfected reference.
The primary transcriptomic data was extracted and quantile normalized using the ‘normali-
zeBetweenArrays’ method available in ‘limma’ package of the R suite as previously described
[80]. Differential expression of mock-vaccinated and vaccinated animals was determined by
comparing the average gene expression of influenza virus-challenged animals to the average
expression prior to challenge for each group applying a linear model fit using the ‘limma’ pack-
age. Criteria for differential expression were an absolute fold-change of 1.5 and an adjusted
p-value of <0.05, calculated by Benjamini-Hochberg correction [81]. The microarray expres-
sion data generated in this study is available via the following accession identifier on the
NCBI-GEO database: (GSE77824).
Functional analysis of gene expression
Functional analysis of differentially expressed (DE) genes was performed using Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis (IPA, Ingenuity Systems). IPA functional enrichment was calculated using a
right-tailed Fisher’s exact test with a threshold of significance set at a p-value of 0.05 and pre-
sented as–log10 p-values. Enrichment of Diseases and Biological Functions were based on acti-
vation Z-scores with an absolute value >2 using IPA. The primary purpose of an activation z-
scores is to infer whether a biological function is increased or decreased based on the gene
expression changes[82].
Statistical analyses
All of the analyses were performed using Graphpad Prism version 5.01. A Student’s t test (to
compare two samples) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) (to compare multiple samples) were
used for statistical analysis. A Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare immune responses
and viral loads between vaccinated and control groups in the macaque studies. A Spearman-

 rank correlation test was used to analyze correlations between immune responses and viral
loads. A p value of <0.05 was considered to be significant. The use of N = 8 for immunogenic-
ity and N = 5 for efficacy studies is based on prior experience, goals in comparing the groups,
and power analysis using Mann Whitney U test to compare expected outcomes between
groups. Group sizes were determined based efficacy. Based on power analysis, a minimum of
N = 5 per group is expected to provide 76.5–93.1% power to show a 2-fold difference in immu-
nogenicity or viral load measurements in blood or mucosal specimens between treatment
groups and untreated controls. This assumes the standard deviation in mean responses for
each measure range from 35–55%.
