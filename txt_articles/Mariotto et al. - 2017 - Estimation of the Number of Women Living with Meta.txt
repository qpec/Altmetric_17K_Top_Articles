Abstract
Background: Distant metastatic breast cancer (MBC), includ-
ing metastases found at diagnosis (de novo) and those occurring
later (recurrence), represents the most severe form of the disease,
when resource utilization is most intensive. Yet, the number of
women living with MBC in the United States is unknown. The
objective of this article is to use population-based data to estimate
the prevalence of MBC.
Methods: We used a back-calculation method to estimate MBC
prevalence from U.S. breast cancer mortality and survival from the
Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registries. On
the basis of the illness–death process, this method assumes that
each observed breast cancer death is the result of MBC, either de
novo or a recurrence with metastatic disease.
Results: We estimate that by January 1, 2017, there will be
154,794 women living with MBC in the United States, three in
four initially diagnosed with stage I–III breast cancer who later
progressed to MBC.
Median survival and 5-year relative survival for de novo MBC
increased over the years, especially in younger women. We esti-
mate a two-fold increase in 5-year relative survival rate from 18%
to 36%, for women diagnosed with de novo MBC at age 15–49
between 1992–1994 and 2005–2012, respectively.
Conclusions: This study demonstrates an increasing number
of women in the United States living with MBC, likely the
result of improvements in treatment and aging of the U.S.
population.
Impact: The increasing burden of MBC highlights the impor-
tance of documenting recurrence to foster more research into the
specific needs of this understudied population. Cancer Epidemiol

Introduction
In 2016, there are approximately 3.5 million women living
with a history of breast cancer in the United States (1). This
number includes newly diagnosed women with breast cancer
undergoing surgery and adjuvant treatment, long-term survivors
who may be cured of the disease, and women who have experi-
enced a recurrence after a disease-free interval. Distant metastatic
cancers, including metastases found at diagnosis (de novo) and
those occurring later in the disease course (distant recurrence),
who represent the majority of cases, constitute the most advanced
form of the disease. Many groups, including the Orphan Drug
Program of the FDA, health services researchers, and especially the
cancer survivorship and advocacy community are increasingly
interested in assessing the prevalence of women with metastatic
breast cancer (MBC), as these women have significant health care
needs when resource utilization tends to be continuous and
intensive (2–6).
The prevalence of women initially diagnosed with MBC can be
directly estimated (7) using population-based cancer registry data
on de novo MBC and vital status at the study cutoff date. However,
estimating prevalence of those diagnosed with early-stage breast
cancer who later have had a distant recurrence is challenging, as
there are no nationally representative data that capture recurrence.
Currently, registries in the United States do not routinely collect or
report recurrence data.
In the absence of empirical data on the incidence of recurrent
MBC, a back-calculation method, Mortality Incidence Approach
MODel (MIAMOD; refs. 8, 9), has been used to reconstruct
prevalence of recurrent cancer in Australia (10). This method
calculates the incidence of MBC (de novo and distant recurrence)
based on breast cancer mortality and MBC survival. The method
has also been used to estimate the prevalence of breast cancer
survivors in states within the United States (11) when cancer
incidence data are not available over the long-term.
The objective of this article is to use national data on breast
cancer mortality and MBC survival from Surveillance, Epidemi-
ology and End Results (SEER) registries to estimate the prevalence
of women living with MBC in the United States, including both
women initially diagnosed with MBC and those who have pro-
gressed to distant MBC. We also calculate separately the preva-
lence of women diagnosed with de novo MBC in SEER and the
United States (7). The SEER de novo MBC prevalence is compared
with an estimate based on the back-calculation method to vali-
date the method and calibrate survival (11).

 on all cancer cases diagnosed in defined geographic areas. Data
included in this report are from the SEER-9 and SEER-11 registries
(November 2015 Submission) obtained using SEER�Stat software
version 8.3.2 (www.seer.cancer.gov/seerstat). SEER-9 covers
approximately 11% of the U.S. population and includes Atlanta,
Connecticut, Detroit, Hawaii, Iowa, New Mexico, San Francisco-
Oakland, Seattle-PugetSound, and Utah.For survival analyses, we
used data from 1992–2012 from the SEER-11 registries which
include SEER-9, Los Angeles and San-Jose Monterey. We only
included invasive breast cancers.
Stage at diagnosis was defined using adjusted American Joint
Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 6th edition staging classification
(12). This stage definition uses extent of disease information for
cases diagnosed in 1988–2003 and collaborative staging for cases
diagnosed in 2004–2012. De novo MBC was defined as AJCC 6
stage IV which includes only tumors with distant metastasis. Stage
IV from previous AJCC editions and distant stage from SEER
historical summary staging classification include some locally
advanced tumors without distant metastasis, for example, tumors
with positive supraclavicular lymph node involvement without
distant metastasis. Recurrent MBC was used to designate women
initially diagnosed with AJCC stages I–III breast cancer, whose
disease later progressed (metastasized) after treatment to distant
organs or tissues.
Main inputs to the back-calculation methods are cancer
deaths, all cause-deaths, population sizes, and MBC survival.
We obtained U.S. female deaths due to breast cancer and all
causes, from 1990 to 2012 from the National Center for Health
Statistics (NCHS) and U.S. female populations from 1990 to
2020 from the U.S. Census Bureau. The population projections
are based on the July 1, 2013, population estimates, which are
based on the 2010 Census, and provide projections of the
population for 2014 through 2060 (https://www.census.gov/
population/projections/data/national/2014.html). Deaths and
populations were obtained by single calendar year and single
age (0–99 years) using the SEER�Stat software.
Survival associated with cancer diagnosis was assessed via
relative survival calculated using SEER�Stat. Relative survival is
based on the ratio of overall survival (all causes of death)
among cancer cases to the expected survival in individuals
without cancer. The expected survival is estimated from U.S.
life tables matched to the group of cancer patients by age, sex,
race, and calendar year. Relative survival captures all excess
mortality among cancer cases including deaths attributable to
treatment and as such serves as a proxy for disease-specific
survival that accounts for treatment-related mortality. In cal-
culating relative survival, we excluded women diagnosed
through death certificate or autopsy because of uncertainties
in the diagnosis date. We also excluded cases with no follow-up
information.
Prevalence of de novo MBC using the counting method
The prevalence of de novo MBC in the SEER-9 areas (counts and
proportions) is calculated directly using the SEER�Stat counting
method (7), which counts all women alive on December 31,
2013, with a previous diagnosis of stage IV breast cancer (1988–
2012) in the SEER-9 areas. The method also adjusts for cases lost
to follow-up. To estimate the de novo MBC prevalence counts in
the United States, we applied the SEER-9 prevalence proportions
by 5-year age group and race to the respective female U.S.
populations.
Modeling survival time from MBC including de novo and
recurrence
To model survival for de novo MBC cases, we estimated
relative survival by age and year at diagnosis for women
diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer from 1992 to 2012 in
the SEER-11 areas. To extrapolate survival beyond the observed
data, as required by the back-calculation method, we fit a
Weibull mixture cure survival model to de novo MBC relative
survival data. The mixture cure survival model assumes that a
proportion of patients with cancer is cured of cancer whereas
the remaining patients die following a Weibull survival distri-
bution. While most patients with stage IV breast cancer die of
their cancer, this model is used because it allows for modeling
of long-term survivors and extrapolation of survival beyond the
observed data. We fit a separate model to each of the 5 age
groups (15–49, 45–64, 65–74, 75–84, 85–99) and used cal-
endar year as a covariate in the model using the CANSURV
software
(13,
14;
https://surveillance.cancer.gov/cansurv/).
Details of the model are provided in the Supplementary
Materials.
Because population-level data on survival from MBC recur-
rence are unavailable, we use an adjustment to the de novo MBC
survival based on a University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer
Center (MDACC) study that included 2,881 and 643 women,
retrospectively identified and diagnosed between 1992 and 2007
with recurrent and de novo MBC, respectively (15). The compar-
ison of the overall survival curves for recurrent and de novo
MBC, Figure 1 in Dawood and colleagues (15), showed an average
risk of death for recurrent relative to de novo disease of 1.35 [i.e.,
1.35 ¼ log(recurrent survival)/log(de novo survival)]. Recurrent
MBC survival was estimated by applying the 1.35 relative risk
adjustment to each of the modeled de novo MBC survival curves
(recurrent MBC survival ¼ de novo MBC survival1.35). We also
performed sensitivity analyses and provided prevalence estimates
using a lower and a higher relative risk adjustment of 1.2 and 1.5,
respectively.
To model survival from de novo or recurrent MBC, we compute a
weighted average of the de novo MBC survival and the recurrent
MBC survival, that is, MBC survival ¼ w � (de novo MBC survival)
þ (1 � w) � (recurrent MBC survival), where w is the fraction
of breast cancer deaths that are a consequence of de novo MBC
and (1 � w) is the fraction of breast cancer deaths that are a
consequence of recurrent MBC. We use incidence-based mortality
by stage in SEER to estimate w. Details of the calculation are
provided in the Supplementary Materials and Supplementary Fig.
S1 which shows that the resulting estimated w is 0.2, implying that
20% of breast cancer deaths in a given year originate from women
diagnosed with de novo MBC, whereas 80% are deaths from
women diagnosed with earlier stage breast cancer who progressed
to recurrent MBC.
Back-calculation method
We used MIAMOD (8, 9) to estimate incidence and prevalence
from breast cancer mortality and MBC survival. The method is
based on the illness–death process and 2 equations relating
incidence, survival, prevalence, and mortality. The method
assumes that each observed breast cancer death is the result
of MBC, either de novo or recurrent. The first equation
specifies mortality as the sum of prior incidence and survival and
back-calculates incidence of MBC (de novo or recurrent), by single-
year ages and single calendar years, from breast cancer deaths and

 MBC survival. The second equation is used to estimate prevalence
from the estimated incidence and survival. The MIAMOD soft-
ware can be downloaded from (http://www.eurocare.it/Miamod
Piamod/tabid/60/Default.aspx), and details of this application
are included in the Supplementary Materials. Prevalence projec-
tions from 2014 to 2020 assume constant breast cancer mortality
rates at 2014 levels and constant survival but use dynamic
population size projections for these years.
To adjust for data inconsistencies, such as underreporting of
deaths and misclassification of deaths to site of metastasis as
found elsewhere (11), we calibrate the back-calculation method
by comparing the SEER-9 counting-method prevalence of de novo
MBC with the one obtained from the MIAMOD method. The
calibration suggests adjusting MBC survival by a factor of 0.92 ¼
exp(�0.08) to correct for 11% underestimation of the observed
prevalence, that is, S�
MBCðtÞ ¼ SMBCðtÞ0:92. Results from the cali-
bration are shown in the Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3.
Results
In 2013, the last year with observed data, we estimate a
prevalence of MBC of 138,622; of which, 38,897 (28%) are
survivors who were initially diagnosed with de novo stage IV
disease and 99,725 (72%) survivors initially diagnosed with stage
I–III breast cancer who later progressed to MBC (Table 1). The
back-calculation method also estimates 50,344 new diagnoses of
MBC in 2013, of which 12,966 (26%) are de novo and 37,378
(74%) recurrences, thus 3 in 4 are undocumented diagnoses of
MBC. We project that by January 1, 2017, there will be 154,794
women living with MBC in the United States. Using relative risk
adjustment of 1.5 and 1.2, instead of 1.35, we estimate 136,419
and 178,412 in the 2017 U.S. MBC prevalence, respectively.
Figure 1 shows that, based on our calculations, MBC prevalence
in terms of the number of women living with MBC increased 4%
from 1990 to 2000, 17% from 2000 to 2010, and is projected to
increase by 31% from 2010 to 2020. Although the largest majority
of prevalent cases are women who have been living with meta-
static disease for 2 years or less (40%), one third (34%) have lived
for 5 years or more with MBC (Fig. 2).
Relative survival estimates used in the modeling included
25,935 women diagnosed with de novo stage IV BC from 1992–
2012 (Table 2). Median survival and 5-year relative survival
increased over the years especially for younger women diagnosed
after 1995 (Table 2). Median relative survival time increased from
22.3 to 38.7 months and from 19.1 to 29.7 months for women
diagnosed between ages 15–49 and 50–64, respectively, during
1992–1994 versus 2005–2012. The 5-year relative survival rate
had a 2-fold increase from 18% to 36%, for women diagnosed
with de novo MBC at age 15–49 between 1992–1994 and 2005–
2012, respectively. Despite a poor prognosis, there is a small but
meaningful percentage of these cases who survive 10 years or
more; more than 11% of women diagnosed between 2000–2004
under the age of 64 years survived 10 years or more. Younger
women diagnosed with de novo MBC have higher survival than
women diagnosed at older ages (Fig. 3).
Figure 4 compares MBC survival in SEER and in the MDACC
study cohort. The MDACC cohort included 2,881 and 643 women
with recurrent and de novo MBC, respectively, retrospectively
identified and diagnosed between years 1992 and 2007 and ages
17 and 91 years. To be comparable, we selected women diagnosed
with de novo MBC in SEERin the samecalendar years (1992–2007)
and ages 15 through 84. In the MDACC cohort, the median age at
diagnosis was 52 and 50 years for de novo and recurrent MBC,
respectively, whereas in SEER, the median age at diagnosis was 61
years. Relative survival for women diagnosed with de novo MBC in
the SEER areas was lower than overall survival among women in
the MDACC cohort. The 4-year relative survival rate of de novo
MBC in SEER was 27% compared with 41% and 29% overall
survival for de novo and recurrent MBC in the MDACC cohort,
respectively. Relative survival is generally higher than overall

 survival for de novo MBC (Table 1), thus these results suggest that
the MDACC cohort represents a lower risk cohort than the general
population. The absolute difference decreased with longer follow-
up and 10-year relative survival was 10% in SEER versus 14% in
the MDACC for women diagnosed with de novo MBC (Fig. 4).
Discussion
Despite the progressive and incurable nature of almost all MBC,
median survival after diagnosis with metastatic disease has been
increasing, resulting in a growing number of women living with
MBC in the United States. The increased survival is especially
noted for women diagnosed at younger ages. We estimate a 2-fold
increase in 5-year relative survival rate from 18% to 36%, for
women diagnosed with de novo stage IV at age 15–49 between
1992–1994 and 2005–2012, respectively, translating into an
increase of approximately one third in the number of women
living with MBC, from 105,354 in 1990 to 138,622 in 2013. We
further project that by 2017, there will be 154,794 women living
with MBC in the United States.
To our knowledge, this is the first time that the number of
women living with MBC in the United States has been estimated.
These estimates provide a new perspective on the population
burden of breast cancer and have great potential significance to the
research and advocacy community working on behalf of patients
with MBC and their families.
Other studies have also shown improvement in survival for
women with de novo distant disease or metastatic recurrence (16–
18), attributed to improved treatment. The improvement in MBC
survival may also be explained by changes in staging. A study
using SEER data (19) has shown that incidence of distant breast
cancer has been increasing, especially among young women
(Supplementary Fig. S4). Also, the incidence of stage III and
unknown stage has been decreasing (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Thus, although survival may have increased because of improve-
ments in treatment, part of the increase may be also due to stage
migration from stage III or unstaged to stage IV or early detection
of stage IV, likely due to increasing availability of better imaging
techniques.
Strengths of our study include the large population size, the
population-based setting, the long follow-up, and the fact that we
used consistent definitions of staging and other variables across
time. The calibrated back-calculation method showed a very good
agreement with reported incidence and directly estimated prev-
alence of de novo MBC in the SEER areas. The calibration corrects
for possible underreporting and misclassification of cause of
death.
The main limitation of this study is the absence of population-
based survival estimates following MBC recurrence. To represent

 received before the point of recurrence. Other causes of death,
not associated with breast cancer or its treatment, are assumed
to be similar between patients with de novo and recurrence
MBC. Sensitivity analyses to this assumption showed that U.S.
prevalence of MBC estimates would vary from 136,000 to
178,000 in 2017 using a higher relative risk of death (RR ¼
1.5) or a lower relative risk of death (RR ¼ 1.2) for recurrent
MBC survival compared with de novo MBC survival. However,
we noted that SEER survival was lower than survival in the
MDACC. Possible explanations may be the fact that MDACC
patients were younger than SEER patients and that, by defini-
tion, they were in treatment at a major cancer center, and
therefore more likely to receive optimal care. Given these
differences, collection of additional data to estimate recurrent
MBC survival would be of value.
We used the adjusted 6th edition stage IV to define MBC to only
include tumors that have metastasized to distant sites. If instead,
we used SEER historical distant stage definition, prevalence would
have been higher, as some tumors without a distant metastasis are
included in this definition.
At one time, a diagnosis of distant recurrence or de novo stage IV
meant that death from breast cancer was likely to be imminent.
Today, with the development of new therapies that target the
drivers of breast cancer, and with improved palliative care, MBC is
not the immediate death sentence it once was. With optimal care,
women with MBC can and often do live for years with reasonable
quality of life, albeit undergoing constant treatment to keep their
disease under control.
This study demonstrates that there are a large number of
women in the United States living with MBC and that this
number has increased in more recent years, likely the result of
treatment and aging of the U.S. population. This study demon-
strates a growing burden of MBC in the United States. It also
makes clear that the majority of patients with MBC, the three
out of four who are diagnosed with nonmetastatic cancer but
progress to distant disease, has never been properly documen-
ted. Given the growing burden of MBC, it is critical to collect
data on recurrence to foster more research into the specific
needs of this understudied population (5).
In an ideal world, a cancer registry would record the experi-
ences of all patients throughout the entire cycle of disease,
enabling researchers, health policy experts and planners, pro-
viders, patients, and advocates to understand the full impact of
cancer. Finding ways to incorporate information on metastatic
disease progression would be an important advance and a key
first step toward a comprehensive assessment of the population
burden of disease.
