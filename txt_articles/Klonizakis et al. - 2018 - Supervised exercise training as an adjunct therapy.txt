Summary
Background Venous leg ulcers (VLUs) are typically painful and heal slowly. Com-
pression therapy offers high healing rates; however, improvements are not usu-
ally sustained. Exercise is a low-cost, low-risk and effective strategy for
improving physical and mental health. Little is known about the feasibility and
efficacy of supervised exercise training used in combination with compression
therapy patients with VLUs.
Objectives To assess the feasibility of a 12-week supervised exercise programme as
an adjunct therapy to compression in patients with VLUs.
Methods This was a two-centre, two-arm, parallel-group, randomized feasibility
trial. Thirty-nine patients with venous ulcers were recruited and randomized
1 : 1 either to exercise (three sessions weekly) plus compression therapy or
compression only. Progress/success criteria included exercise attendance rate,
loss to follow-up and patient preference. Baseline assessments were repeated at
12 weeks, 6 months and 1 year, with healing rate and time, ulcer recurrence
and infection incidents documented. Intervention and healthcare utilization costs
were calculated. Qualitative data were collected to assess participants’ experi-
ences.
Results Seventy-two per cent of the exercise group participants attended all sched-
uled exercise sessions. No serious adverse events and only two exercise-related
adverse events (both increased ulcer discharge) were reported. Loss to follow-up
was 5%. At 12 months, median ulcer healing time was lower in the exercise
group (13 vs. 34�7 weeks). Mean National Health Service costs were £813�27 for
the exercise and £2298�57 for the control group.
Conclusions The feasibility and acceptability of both the supervised exercise pro-
gramme in conjunction with compression therapy and the study procedures is
supported.
What’s already known about this topic?
•
Almost 70% of all leg ulcers have a venous component.
•
Up to 30% of venous leg ulcers (VLUs) do not respond to compression alone,
remain open after 1 year of treatment and need an average of 51 treatment visits
to heal.
•
Adjunct therapies to compression are needed.
•
Exercise can form part of the therapeutic pathway, but evidence to determine
whether exercise training has an effect on ulcer healing and quality of life is
limited.

 What does this study add?
•
The findings support the feasibility and acceptability of supervised exercise training
as an adjunct therapy for adults with VLUs.
•
The preliminary data also support the potential effectiveness of exercise training in
improving ulcer healing.
•
An appropriately powered, multicentre trial is required to confirm the clinical and
cost-effectiveness of the intervention.
Almost 70% of all leg ulcers have a venous component.1
Occurrence of venous leg ulcers (VLUs) increases with age,
with the U.K. prevalence in those > 65 years of age being
estimated at about 3%.2 VLUs arise from venous valve incom-
petence and calf muscle pump insufficiency, which leads to
venous stasis and hypertension. This results in microcircula-
tory changes and localized tissue ischaemia.3,4 The natural his-
tory of VLUs is of a continuous cycle of healing and
breakdown over decades:5 VLUs are typically painful and heal
slowly, resulting in an impaired quality of life (QoL), social
isolation and reduced work productivity.6 Treatment of this
major health problem results in a considerable cost to the
National Health Service (NHS): each ulcer costs up to £1981
per year;7 estimated total healthcare costs are between £198
million and £400 million per year,8,9 with 65% of these costs
occurring in the community.10
Lower-limb compression therapy is an established first-line
therapy for VLUs,11 with approximately 50% of VLUs closing
within 24 weeks.10 Nevertheless, recurrence rates remain high
(up to 56% within 4 years).12 Furthermore, up to 30% of VLUs
do not respond to compression alone, remain open after 1 year
of treatment and need an average of 51 treatment visits to
heal.10,11,13 Therefore, it is important to develop adjunct thera-
pies to compression, which would improve healing outcomes.
Lifestyle factors, including nutrition, exercise and smoking,
are mentioned in guidelines on the management of VLUs but
receive relatively little emphasis.14 Exercise training might
enhance ulcer healing and other aspects of health, and is rou-
tinely prescribed for other cardiovascular diseases (e.g. periph-
eral arterial disease and coronary artery disease).15,16 In
patients with VLUs, supervised calf muscle exercise has been
shown to increase calf muscle pump function and improve
lower-limb haemodynamics,17,18 as well as mobility and
QoL.19–21
A
recent
systematic
review
suggested
further
research to determine whether exercise training has an effect
on ulcer healing and QoL.22
Our team recently completed ‘FISCU’ [Feasibility of Imple-
menting Supervised exercise training alongside Compression
therapy in people with venous Ulceration; a National Institute
for Health Research-funded study (PB-PG-0213-30029)]5 to
assess the feasibility of a 12-week supervised exercise pro-
gramme combining aerobic, resistance and flexibility exercises
as an adjunct therapy to compression in patients with VLUs. We
report on rates of screening, eligibility, recruitment, retention,
outcome completion, exercise adherence and adverse events
(AEs). We also report on reasons for exclusion and nonconsent,
sample characteristics, the distribution and completeness of
potential primary outcomes, and provide information on pre-
liminary data on effectiveness and healthcare resource use.
Patients and methods
A full description of methods is available in our previously
published protocol paper.5 The study was a two-arm, parallel-
group, randomized controlled feasibility trial conducted in
two U.K. sites (Lincoln and Sheffield). Ethics approval was
granted by the NHS National Research Ethics Service, York-
shire and the Humber (Sheffield) Committee (14/YH/0091),
and all participants provided written informed consent prior
to enrolment. The trial was prospectively registered (Current
Controlled Trials ISRCTN10205425).
Participants
Participants were recruited from community nursing and tis-
sue viability teams or services, community and outpatient leg
ulcer clinics, and newspaper advertisement. Inclusion and
exclusion criteria are given in Table 1.
Randomization, allocation concealment and blinding
Following baseline assessments, participants were randomly
assigned 1 : 1 to an intervention group or a control group.
Participants were stratified by ulcer size (maximum ulcer
diameter 1–3 cm or > 3 cm in any direction). Outcome asses-
sors were blinded to group allocation.
Interventions
All participants received standard compression therapy directed
by experienced tissue-viability nurses, following standard local
practice. Patients were reviewed in clinics as considered clini-
cally necessary, with no interference by the study team.
Participants randomized to the exercise group were invited
to attend three sessions of supervised exercise each week for
12 weeks (total of 36 sessions) at one of the two study

University of Lincoln). For details on the exercise components
see Table S1 (Supporting Information).
Study schedule and assessments
During visit 1, after written informed consent had been
obtained and eligibility confirmed (which included a medical
examination), the following baseline measurements were
recorded at one of the two research centres (Sheffield Hallam
University, University of Lincoln): (i) demographic data,
including age, sex and socioeconomic status; (ii) clinical his-
tory, current medications, stature, body mass, ankle and calf
circumference; (iii) ulcer size; (iv) ankle brachial pressure
index (ABPI; a Doppler-determined measurement of ABPI was
performed according to the procedures of Aboyans et al.,23
unless a reading < 3 months old could be obtained from clin-
ical records, following the patient’s consent); (v) baseline
exercise history; (vi) health-related QoL (HRQoL) question-
naires (EQ-5D-5L and VEINES-QOL);24–26 (vii) lower-limb
cutaneous
microvascular
function
(methods
and
results
reported elsewhere);27 (viii) physical fitness, using three items
from the Senior Fitness Test (6-min walking test, chair sit and
reach, chair sit and stand)28 and ankle range of motion
assessed using a bi-plane ankle goniometer.
All participants were given a resource use diary to complete
at home for the duration of the study (to conduct health eco-
nomics analysis).
Participants were then randomized to one of the two
groups, as described above.
At 12 weeks and 12 months, participants had the following
measures and tests repeated: physical fitness, microvascular
function, ulcer-related clinical data (size, status and recur-
rence) and medications, body mass and HRQoL question-
naires. A copy of the resource use diary was also taken. A
postal assessment involving the completion of HRQoL ques-
tionnaires was also undertaken at 6 months.
Feasibility and acceptability outcomes
Recruitment rates were measured as rate of invited participants
who were eligible and consenting. Acceptability of allocation
was assessed by examining reasons for dropout in discontinu-
ing participants and comparing attrition rates between the two
study groups. Suitability of measurement procedures was eval-
uated by outcome completion rates and reasons for missing
data. Attrition rate was established as discontinuation of inter-
vention and loss to follow-up measurement for all conditions.
The acceptability of the exercise programmes was assessed by
using session attendance and compliance data and participant
feedback via one-to-one semi-structured interviews conducted
with a subgroup of participants after the 3-month follow-up
visit (detailed analysis will be presented elsewhere). The safety
of exercise training was also assessed by exploring reasons for
dropout from the exercise programme and the number and
type of AEs that occurred in each group.
Sample size
Sample size calculation was based on willingness for random-
ization and aimed to recruit 80 participants within an
18-month recruitment period (Table S1; see Supporting Infor-
mation).
Data analysis
All analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis,
conducted in SPSS version 24 (IBM, Armonk, NY, U.S.A.).
Missing data were reported by trial arm with description of
underlying reasons.
Baseline
Summary tables report all baseline variables, and clinical, fit-
ness and patient-reported outcome variables. Continuous vari-
ables were summarized with descriptive statistics. Frequency
counts and percentages were provided for categorical data.
Feasibility and acceptability

feasibility and acceptability of key trial parameters were rates
of eligibility, recruitment, retention, outcome completion,
exercise adherence and AEs.5 Group preference, reasons for

 exclusion and nonconsent, sample characteristics and the dis-
tribution of potential primary outcomes are presented.
Clinical, fitness and patient-reported outcomes
Descriptive statistics are presented for clinical, fitness and
patient-reported outcomes at each time point.
Economic evaluation
A prospective economic evaluation was rehearsed to develop
and refine the methods for a subsequent definitive trial
(Appendix S1; see Supporting Information).
Results
Figure 1 shows the flow of participants through the trial.
Recruitment took place between July 2014 and May 2016,
with all follow-up data collection completed by May 2017.
The trial was extended for 3 months to allow extra recruit-
ment time.
Screening, eligibility and recruitment
A summary of feasibility and acceptability data is presented in
Table 3. All success criteria were met (e.g. 72% of participants
completed all exercise sessions, loss to follow-up was 5%,
patient preference to the exercise group was 44%, whereas
median ulcer healing time was chosen as the primary outcome
for the definitive trial). Of 514 patients screened for participa-
tion, 109 met the eligibility criteria and 39 (24 men, 15
women) were recruited, giving eligibility and recruitment
rates of 21% and 36%, respectively. Sites 1 and 2 recruited 38
and one participants, respectively. Reasons for nonconsent and
exclusion are shown in Figure 1.
Group allocation, group preference and participant
characteristics
Eighteen participants were allocated to exercise and 21 to
usual care. Seventeen (63%) of 27 participants expressed a
preference for exercise (12 expressed no preference). Partici-
pant characteristics at baseline are shown in Table 4; the
groups were well balanced for most variables except QoL.
Retention
Retention rate was 95%. Two of 39 participants formally left
the study; one from the exercise group for ulcer pain before
the 3-month assessment and one from the control group for
nonulcer-related health reasons before the 6-month assess-
ment. All others completed all assessment sessions. Four par-
ticipants withdrew from exercise training due to family
commitments and nonulcer-related health reasons.
Exercise attendance and safety data
Of the 18 exercise participants, 13 (72%) completed all ses-
sions; overall session completion rate was 79% (n = 512/
648). No bandage slippage/misplacement was detected during
exercise sessions. We observed two exercise-related AEs (both
excessive discharge from the ulcer). Actions taken included
the removal of resistance exercises and postponement of exer-
cise sessions.
Physical function and body mass
Participants in the exercise group showed higher mean values
at 3 months in all tests (Table 5). Results stabilized at
12 months for all tests except plantar flexion. Weight reduc-
tion was modest for the exercise group in relation to the base-
line
(mean � SD
103�9 � 24 kg
at
baseline
vs.
99�8 � 28�4 kg at 12 months). In contrast there was an
increase
in
weight
in
the
control
group
(mean � SD
102�6 � 25�6 kg vs. 105�7 � 25�2 kg at 12 months).
Ulcer-related data
Median ulcer size was similar between groups at 12 months
(Table 6), but healing rate was higher in the intervention
group (83% vs. 60%), with shorter median (range) ulcer
healing time [13 (3�9–52) vs. 34�7 (4�3–52) weeks]. Recur-
rence rates were low in both groups (two in the intervention
group, one in the control group).
Health-related quality of life
Participants in the intervention group started the study with a
higher EQ-5D utility score than the control group (Table 7;
mean � SD 0�8022 � 0�17 vs. 0�6010 � 0�35). This differ-
ence
was
maintained
throughout
the
study.
A
similar
difference was observed with EQ visual analogue scale,
VEINES-QOL (overall score and symptom score) and pain
score, although for VEINES-QOL and pain score, the difference
between groups was increased from 3 months onwards.
Health economic data
There were no missing data for procedure costs. Mean exercise
intervention costs per participant was £610�22, including staff
time, room hire and patient reimbursement. Mean total NHS

 costs (based on NHS National Tariff Schedules and calculated
based on visits and usage of NHS resources) were calculated
as £813�27 for the exercise and £2298�57 for the control
group.
Personal costs were calculated using a diary with ‘out-of-
pocket’ expenses being estimated at £113�63 and £174�58 for
the exercise and control groups, respectively.
The mean ‘per patient’ cost savings to the NHS from the
exercise intervention was £875�08. Similarly, the ‘per patient’
less ‘out-of-pocket’ expenses to participants, as a result of par-
ticipation in exercise intervention, was £60�95. The combined
per ‘per patient’ mean total cost saving was £936�03 (Table 8
and Appendix S1; see Supporting Information).
Discussion
We successfully assessed several feasibility study aspects,
including recruitment, baseline and follow-up measurements,
Table 3 Summary of trial feasibility and acceptability data
Methodological issues
Findings
Evidence
What factors influenced eligibility
and what proportion of those
screened were eligible?
Tissue viability clinics see a variety
of patient wounds, the majority of
which are not ulcers or of venous
origin
109/514 screened were eligible; the most common
reasons for noneligibility were ulcer not of venous origin
or other type of wound present (n = 206); the main
reasons for nonconsent were mainly of social origin (e.g.
work commitments or difficulty travelling; n = 52)
Was recruitment successful?
Recruitment was slower than
anticipated
39 participants were recruited within a 21-month period
Were eligible patients recruited?
Conversion rate to recruitment was
within our primary targets
39/109 (36%) eligible participants were recruited in the
study
Were participants successfully
randomized and did randomization
yield equality in groups?
Randomization process worked well
Similar sized groups, well-balanced on stratification and
most other variables; however, QoL scores were higher at
baseline in the exercise group
Were blinding procedures adequate?
Blinding of outcome assessors and
ulcer healing assessments worked
well
Two different assessors were used at follow-up sessions.
No discussions were reported between participants and
assessors on their study experience during follow-up
sessions. Assessment of digital ulcer photographs was
completed by a team member unaware of the association
between study ID numbers and group allocation
Did participants adhere to the
intervention?
We experienced a very high
attendance rate
13/18 (72%) of the exercise group participants attended
100% of the scheduled exercise sessions; 512/648 (79%)
of the scheduled sessions were completed
Was the intervention acceptable to
the participants?
Qualitative and quantitative data
from exercise participants suggest
that the intervention was acceptable
Of the 27 participants who expressed a preference for a
specific group before allocation (12 of the study
participants did not express a preference), 17 (69%
among those expressing preference; 44% among all)
preferred exercise. Patient interviews (reported elsewhere)
have also suggested a high degree of satisfaction
Was the intervention safe?
Our preliminary safety data appear
favourable
Two nonserious AEs (excess fluid discharge from ulcer)
were noted during the study; no bandaging was affected
during the exercise sessions
Were outcome assessments
completed?
Outcome completion rates were very
high
See ‘Results’ section
Was it possible to calculate
intervention and healthcare
utilization costs?
Yes
Cost of exercise programme: £610�22 per participant. Total
costs per participant were £2412�2 (including out-of-
pocket expenses) and £1537�10 for control and exercise
group patients, respectively
Was retention to the study good?
Retention was very high
Retention rate 95%
Did all components of the protocol
work together?
From the point that the recruitment
procedures were modified,
components had strong synergy
There were no major difficulties identified in the various
processes and the researchers’ ability to implement them.
For example, if participants were recruited, there was
excellent collaboration between the care and the research
team in regards to data capture (e.g. tracing, ulcer
photography)
Was an appropriate outcome defined
for the definitive trial?
Yes
Based on our study and previous research experience, a
reduction in ulcer healing time appears to be the most
appropriate outcome for the definitive trial

Exercise in adults with venous ulcers, M. Klonizakis et al. 1079
 as well as the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a
supervised exercise programme for people with VLUs. Our
main finding was that the study procedures were feasible and
acceptable.
The feasibility and acceptability of using a supervised exer-
cise regime as an adjunct therapy to compression therapy had
been an area of uncertainty prior to this study. Indeed, during
the preliminary study stages, such a notion was met with
scepticism by some clinicians and patients, who believed that
exercise may be either inappropriate or harmful, and may
delay rather than promote healing – an attitude that has also
been documented in the literature.29,30 Nevertheless, the
majority of the eligible patients had a positive attitude towards
undertaking exercise in addition to following a therapeutic
pathway based on compression therapy. This was irrespective
of whether they consented to take part and reasons for non-
participation will help make the programme more accessible
(i.e. by choosing appropriate venues). Our feasibility data
show few AEs, with no bandage misplacement or slippage
incidents,
one
of
the
biggest
concerns
of
collaborating
clinicians.
Exercise attendance was 79%, with 72% of participants
completing all sessions. This is high considering that many
participants were old, frail and had no previous exercise expe-
rience. This was achieved without employing any specific
adherence-enhancing components or provision of behavioural
change support, which could have potentially improved atten-
dance rates and the effect of the intervention even further.31
This suggests great interest and self-motivation from our par-
ticipants, which will be a decisive factor for the success of a
definitive trial and any wider roll-out of the intervention.
However, despite our success, it is our plan to incorporate
cognitive–behavioural strategies as part of any future trial to
optimize exercise adherence and increase any potential, posi-
tive effect.
With regard to practicality our intervention was primarily
delivered within a university setting, at some distance from
the clinics in which our participants were treated. The high
attendance rate suggests that this did not have a negative
impact on the outcome, although it may have affected recruit-
ment rate. Recruitment rate may be improved in the definitive
trial, where 12-week exercise referral schemes will be utilized
for the intervention delivery.32 Delivery with an option of
times in community-based venues increases accessibility but
comes with a number of challenges (as adherence and success
varies);33 recent research suggests that these schemes can offer
QoL and physical activity gains.34
Our findings support the feasibility of using diaries to collect
economic data on patients’ usage of NHS resources, healthcare
visits, prescriptions and out-of-pocket expenses. The findings
suggest potential savings to both the NHS (£875�08 per
patient) and patients (£60�95 reduction in out-of-pocket
expenses). Nevertheless, as our analysis was purely descriptive,
an appropriate health economics analysis in the definitive trial
will provide greater certainty regarding cost-effectiveness.
Overall, no major difficulties were identified in the design
or implementation of trial procedures. For example, the blind-
ing procedures ran as intended, the rates of retention and out-
come completion (including the 6-month postal assessment)
was very good, and from a point onwards there was an excel-
lent communication between clinical and research teams,
which allowed smooth recruitment. There was an imbalance
between groups in the EQ-5D-5L data; this did not affect the
success of our study but may need to be considered in plan-
ning the definitive trial.
Designing, setting up and managing a definitive, multicentre
study has other challenges besides recruitment rate, data collec-
tion and exercise delivery. One important issue is the recruit-
ment of a sufficient number of sites which will: (i) deliver the
required
number
of
participants;
(ii)
have
experienced

 clinicians to act as local Principal Investigators; (iii) have dedi-
cated tissue viability services, which will support and promote
the study; and (iv) have a good communication level between
exercise deliverers, tissue viability clinics, local stakeholders
(e.g. NHS Trusts) and the main research team. It is therefore
advisable that a clinical trials unit is utilised to safeguard data
quality and guarantee database management, in addition to
costing dedicated personnel (e.g. a trial coordinator and a trial
manager) for day-to-day study management and involving
experienced research sites in previous, similar studies (which
would safeguard a consistent delivery of the trial protocol).
Our findings support the feasibility and acceptability of both
the supervised exercise programme in conjunction with com-
pression therapy and the study procedures and all our success
criteria were met.5 In addition, our results suggest that there
may be significant potential benefit in healing rates and that, if
this were confirmed in a full trial, the introduction of super-
vised exercise for VLU may well also save costs for the NHS.
The next step will be the design and implementation of an
appropriately powered, multicentre trial, which is required to
provide answers to the questions of the clinical and cost-effec-
tiveness of the intervention.
