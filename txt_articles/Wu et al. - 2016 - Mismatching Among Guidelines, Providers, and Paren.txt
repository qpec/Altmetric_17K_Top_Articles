 mismatched with their provider’s recommendations; and (3) evaluate parent attitudes and 
demographic characteristics associated with these mismatches.
Methods—In this cross-sectional study, we conducted linked surveys of parents and providers of 
children with probable persistent asthma in a Medicaid program and four commercial health plans 
in 2011. Probable persistent asthma was defined as a diagnosis of asthma and ≥1 controller 
medication dispensing.
Results—This study included 740 children (mean age 8.6 years). Providers for 50% of the 
children reported prescribing controller medications for daily year-round use, 41% for daily use 
during active asthma months, and 9% for intermittent use for relief. Among parents, 72% knew 
which class of controller medication the provider prescribed and 49% knew the administration 
frequency and the medication class. Parents were less likely to report the same controller 
medication type as the provider, irrespective of dose and frequency, if they were Latino [OR 0.23; 
CI 0.057–0.90], had a household smoker [OR 2.87; CI 0.42–19.6], or believed the controller 
medicine was not helping [OR 0.15; CI 0.048–0.45].
Conclusions—Mismatches between parent reports and providers’ intentions regarding how the 
child was supposed to use inhaled steroids occurred for half of children. Efforts should focus on 
ways to reduce mismatches between parent and provider intentions regarding controller 
medication use.

Introduction
Controller medicines for asthma such as inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), leukotriene 
antagonist (LTRA), or combination ICS-long acting beta-agonist (LABA) improve lung 
function, decrease the number of asthma-related hospitalizations, reduce emergency 
department (ED) visits, and limit the use of oral corticosteroids.1–4 However, despite 
national guidelines recommending that all children with persistent asthma use an ICS, 
LTRA, or ICS/LABA,5 morbidity from asthma remains high. Underuse of controller 
medicines for persistent asthma is common,6 and contributes to severe exacerbations, 
including hospitalizations and ED visits.78–12
Underuse of controller medicines may be due to provider under-diagnosis or under-treatment 
of asthma, parent non-adherence, or misunderstandings by parents of what medicine should 
be given and how frequently.13 Designing effective interventions to enhance controller 
medicine use will require more precise understanding of the relative influences of these 
possible barriers than is available from current studies. The objectives of this study were: (1) 
to assess provider prescribing patterns of asthma controller medications; (2) to assess how 
frequently parents’ understanding of their children’s controller medicine regimen matches 
their providers’; and (3) to assess parental characteristics associated with a mismatch 
between parent and provider understanding of the child’s medicine regimen.

 Methods
Design and Study Setting
This was a cross-sectional, linked survey of parents and providers of children with asthma 
within The Population-Based Effectiveness in Asthma and Lung Diseases (PEAL) Network, 
a distributed data network that was created for research on lung diseases and built on 
currently available computerized datasets from the TennCare Medicaid population at 
Vanderbilt Medical Center and four Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) sites: Harvard 
Pilgrim Health Care (HPHC), Health Partners Research Foundation (HPRF), Kaiser 
Permanente of Georgia (KPGA) and Kaiser Permanente of Northern California (KPNC). 
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of each site. This study 
merges parent-reported data, provider-reported data, and administrative claims data.
Data Collection
Computerized medical records or claims data from the four HMOs were used to identify 
children with asthma and their providers. More specifically, we used computerized data to 
identify asthmatic children, then located relevant providers either as identified by parents or 
indicated in the computerized data.
The target population included parents and providers of members ages 4–11 years on 
January 1, 2011, with ≥1 diagnosis of asthma (ICD-9-CM 493.xx) between the years 2004 
and 2008, and ≥1 controller medicine dispensed in 2011 (i.e., ICS, LTRA, ICS/LABA). We 
excluded children receiving omalizumab or chronic oral corticosteroids (≥180 continuous 
days supply) in order to exclude children with the most severe asthma. We also excluded 
children with diagnoses of cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, pulmonary hypertension, 
pulmonary embolism, immunodeficiency, hereditary and degenerative diseases, psychoses, 
and mental retardation.
To identify patients with probable persistent asthma, we intentionally used criteria that erred 
on the side of inclusiveness because variability in asthma severity might affect adherence to 
provider recommendations. To ensure parents and providers of children with persistent 
asthma were included in the sample, we oversampled for asthmatic children with ≥1 asthma-
related hospitalization or emergency department visit in 2011. All results are weighted by 
the sampling fraction, accounting for the design and non-response to represent the target 
population.
Each participating site administered our surveys to its parent and provider populations based 
on its own respective IRB requirements. As a result of regulations regarding the sharing of 
personal health information and levels of consent necessary for subject participation, the 
four HMO Research Network sites used a combination mail and telephone approach for the 
parent survey, while surveys of parents in the TennCare population at Vanderbilt Medical 
Center were completed in person. Parent surveys were primarily conducted in English, but 
were also offered in Spanish at HPHC and Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Surveys were conducted following written informed consent at Vanderbilt or verbal 
informed consent at the other sites. The parent survey consisted of closed-ended questions

 and required approximately 20 minutes to complete. Parents were asked for the name of the 
child’s asthma provider and for permission to contact the provider. Participating parents 
received a $25 gift card. All of the surveys were conducted by the same trained research 
assistant at Vanderbilt.
Provider surveys were administered by mail at HPHC, KPNC, and KPGA sites while 
providers of the TennCare population completed secure web-based surveys via Research 
Electronic Data Capture (REDCap; http://project-redcap.org). HPRF offered the provider 
survey by mail and REDCap. Provider surveys were completed up to 3 months after the 
parent surveys as we required the parent to consent to allow us to contact the provider. The 
provider survey consisted of a combination of closed- and open-ended questions that took 
approximately 10 minutes to complete. We made a total of three attempts to reach the 
provider by mail. In the survey, we suggested that the provider use the child’s medical 
record to help complete the study.
Of 2,341 parents we identified based on computerized data and attempted to contact, 4.7% 
(111) were unreachable due to non-functioning telephone numbers. One hundred and nine 
(4.6%) were ineligible either because they did not speak English or Spanish, had moved out 
of state, or did not have a child with asthma. Of the 2,121 eligible parents, 1,321 completed 
the survey for a completion rate of 62% based on the standard formula from the American 
Association of Public Opinion Research.21 Of the completed parent surveys, 42% (549) 
were returned by mail, 47% (626) were completed over the phone and 8% (112) were 
completed in clinic. Of the 1,321 completed parent surveys, 94% (1,242) provided consent 
for us to contact the child’s provider while 30 parents did not. Of the 1,242 providers 
contacted, 770 completed the survey (62%). After removing the providers for whom parents 
did not give consent to link the surveys to their child’s electronic data, a total of 740 parent-
provider pairs were included in the analysis.
Measures
With questions used in a previous asthma study, we assessed the asthma controller 
medication regimen as reported by the prescribing provider and the parent, including the 
specific controller medicine the child was prescribed or taking, and the frequency with 
which each respondent (provider or parent) thought the medicine should be administered.14 
In the parent survey, a research assistant verbally read a list of the brand and generic names 
of all controller medications for asthma and asked, “Please choose a medicine that your/the 
child is taking.” Multiple responses were allowed for children taking more than one 
controller medication. We aggregated controller medications into three classes: ICS, LTI, 
and ICS/LABA. We assessed two primary outcomes: agreement on medication type and 
agreement on both type and frequency. To assess administration frequency, providers and 
parents were asked: “How is [the] child supposed to use this medicine?” with choice 
responses of “Everyday, year round; Everyday, during active asthma months; or Not 
everyday. Only for relief.” Providers were encouraged to reference the child’s electronic 
medical record when responding to the survey.
The survey included questions that were based on published instruments. Questions on 
concerns about controller medications were previously validated questions on concerns 
Wu et al.

 about medications from a study on medication adherence.15 Each question posed a statement 
on concerns about controller medications, e.g., “My child will become dependent on asthma 
medications if he/she takes them everyday,” and parents were asked to agree or disagree on a 
4-point Likert scale.15 We also asked parents whether they were worried about the long-term 
effects of corticosteroid use with a question that has been used in a previous study.16 The 
survey included questions about parental expectations for symptoms that were developed by 
Yoos and colleagues.17 Each question posed a statement on expectations for asthma, e.g., “I 
expect that my child can fully participate in gym, normal physical activity, and playing.” In 
order to assess asthma control at the time of the interview, the Asthma Control Test (ACT) 
was administered.18–20
Statistical Methods
Analyses were conducted in SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and R. We evaluated 
parent demographic factors and measures of concordance using univariate statistics. In 
bivariate analyses, we evaluated the association of each outcome with parent attitudes and 
beliefs about medicines and other independent variables using the chi-square test for 
categorical variables and t-test for continuous variables. Our main outcomes were: (1) 
parental and provider agreement on which controller medicine the child is supposed to be 
taking, irrespective of dose and frequency and (2) parental and provider agreement on the 
controller medicine and frequency that the medicine should be given. In the multivariable 
analysis, we conducted logistic regression analyses and included those variables that had a 
p<0.2 in the bivariate analysis. We also adjusted in multivariate analyses for the time 
between the last dispensing of controller medication and the date of the survey in order to 
account for recall bias. All results are weighted by the sampling fraction, accounting for the 
matched design and non-response to represent the target population.
Result
Population Characteristics
Our study population included 740 parents of children with probable persistent asthma and 
their providers (Table 1). A total of 1,321 parents of children completed the parent survey 
and 770 of their providers completed the provider survey. Thirty parents declined to have 
their child’s survey information linked to their electronic claims data. The mean age of the 
children was 8.6 years [SD 2.7 years] and 38% (278) were female. The parent sample 
included 34% (246) who self-described as white, 27% (197) Latino, 22% (162) black or 
African American, 12% (88) Asian, and 5% (38) other. As measured by the Asthma Control 
Test (ACT), 39% (282) of children had poorly controlled asthma at the time of the survey as 
defined by ACT ≤ 19.19
We allowed providers to have a maximum of two patients with probable persistent asthma in 
the survey population in order to have a diverse representation of provider recommendations. 
The parents who were approached for survey were selected randomly if a provider had more 
than two patients eligible for the study; 57% of providers completed surveys for a single 
patient and the remaining 43% completed surveys for two children.

 Provider Survey
The providers reported that 77% (572) of the children were supposed to be taking ICS, 23% 
(173) LTRA, and 10% (76) ICS/LABA (Table 2). Among those patients prescribed inhaled 
steroids, providers reported recommending daily year-round use in 50%, daily use during 
active asthma months in 41%, and intermittent use for relief in 9%. Prescribing less 
frequently than daily, year round was more common for ICS compared with LTI and ICS/
LABA. According to the provider survey, 37% (211) of the children prescribed ICS were 
supposed to be using their ICS every day, year round; 50% (287) were supposed to be using 
it during active asthma months; and 13% (74) were supposed to be using it only for relief as 
needed, and not daily. Similarly, providers reported 77% (133) of the children on LTRA 
were supposed to be using the LTRA daily, year round, and 23% (39) reported the LTRA 
was to be used daily, during active asthma months.
Parent Survey
According to the parents, 68% (679) of children were supposed to be taking an ICS, 22% 
(224) a LTRA, and 10% (99) an ICS/LABA (a child could be taking more than one 
controller medicine). There was mismatch between parent and provider understanding of 
which medication should be taken in 29% (168) of children who were supposed to be taking 
ICS according to their providers, 10% (20) of children who were supposed to be taking 
LTRA, and 16% (14) of children who were supposed to be taking ICS/LABA. For the 202 
children who had providers who reported the child was supposed to be using the ICS every 
day, year round, there was mismatch between parent and provider understanding in 27% 
(54). In the 263 children who were supposed to be using ICS everyday when asthma is 
active, there was mismatch between parent and provider understanding for 54% (142) of the 
children, including 36% (94) parents who thought the child was supposed to use ICS 
everyday, year round and 18% (48) parents who thought ICS was supposed to be used not 
every day, only for relief. For the 67 children for whom providers recommended ICS only 
for relief, 34% (23) parents had the same understanding that ICS was only for relief. There 
was mismatch between parent and provider understanding in frequency of ICS in 66% (44) 
children; this included 18% (12) parents who thought ICS should be used everyday, year 
round, and 15% (10) who thought ICS should be used every day during asthma active 
months.
Multivariate Analyses
As presented in Table 3, parents were less likely to report the same controller medication 
type as the provider, irrespective of dose and frequency, if they were Latino [OR 0.23; CI 
0.057–0.90] and believed the controller medicine was not helping [OR 0.15; CI 0.048–0.45]. 
Parents were more likely to report the same controller medication type as the provider if 
there was a household smoker [OR 2.87; CI 0.42–19.6]. Table 4 shows parental and provider 
agreement on both the controller medicine and frequency that the medicine should be given 
if the parent believed that the medicine is not helping [OR 0.22; CI 0.068–0.71] or that the 
child doesn’t need as much medicine as prescribed [OR 0.35; CI 0.17–0.76]. Families that 
have a household smoker were more likely to have parental and provider agreement on the

 controller medicine and frequency that the medicine should be given [OR 6.71; CI 1.05–
42.91].
Discussion
Our study had four key findings. First, providers did not prescribe controller medicines for 
most patients with possible persistent asthma on a daily basis. Second, only 70% of parents 
knew which controller medicine their provider recommended, and half of parents did not 
know the medicine and frequency it was supposed to be given. Third, parent report of the 
child’s controller medication was less likely to match the provider’s if the parent self-
identified as Latino or felt the medicine was not helping. Fourth, a mismatch between parent 
and provider report of the prescribed frequency of controller medication use was associated 
with the parent believing their child did not need as much medicine as prescribed.
Our finding that providers do not prescribe controller medicines on a daily basis for asthma 
is consistent with previous studies. The Expert Panel Report (EPR-3) Summary Report 
2007: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma was developed by the 
NAEPP to improve the quality of care and asthma outcomes based on evidenced-based 
medicine. Adherence to the NAEPP guidelines has been demonstrated to result in improved 
outcomes for asthma, including decreased hospitalizations, ED visits, and outpatient visits.21 
Despite the promise of NAEPP guidelines, morbidity from asthma remains high.6 Poor 
adherence to national guidelines likely plays a role. A study of inner-city providers found 
that only 62% of providers adhere to NHLBI guidelines for ICS use,22 which is higher than 
our study that found that 50% of children received recommendations from their providers to 
take controller medications daily. Our study findings are consistent with a previous survey of 
pediatric providers that found that almost half of pediatric providers did not prescribe daily 
ICS to children with mild persistent asthma and almost all providers felt that seasonal or 
periodic use of ICS could be effective for some patients with asthma.23 We found that 
almost 10% of the children received provider recommendations to use controller 
medications on an as needed basis.
A large number of parents – 50% -- gave answers that conflicted with the provider on both 
which controller medicine the provider recommended and with what frequency the medicine 
was to be given. Improving provider-patient communication during medical visits could help 
with caregiver-reported medicine adherence.24 Research conducted prior to the routine use 
of LTRAs found that the level of caregiver-provider agreement regarding whether the child 
was prescribed an ICS or cromolyn was 78%, suggesting moderate agreement between 
providers and caregivers. Our study suggests that even with the introduction of LTRAs 
which have overall higher adherence than ICS and may be more likely to be recalled by the 
parent,25 parents frequently do not know which controller medicine was prescribed by the 
provider. The frequent mismatch in understanding of which controller medications a child 
should be taking and how often implies that many providers may be unaware of their 
patient’s lack of adherence and suggests that there is room for improvement in 
communication about asthma medication regimens.

 We found that parents of Latino children were less likely to report the child was using the 
same controller medicine, irrespective of frequency, as the provider prescribed. This finding 
is important because some Latino subgroups (e.g. Puerto Ricans) experience higher 
morbidity and mortality due to asthma than white children. This mismatch of patient-
provider expectations seems like a likely cause of the underuse of preventive medicines that 
has been observed in Latino children compared with white children, even among insured 
populations.26 However, it is possible that this finding is a reflection of site-specific 
differences in collection of data, as only two sites were able to enroll Latino participants.
Other findings offer insight into ways that providers might be able to identify families at 
elevated risk for mismatched understandings of how to use controller medicines. For 
example, our finding that parents were less likely to agree on the controller medicine if the 
parents felt the medicine was not helping suggests that providers may be able to identify 
families at risk of non-adherence by asking parents for their impressions about whether the 
medication is helping.
Likewise, parents and providers were less likely to agree on the controller medicine and 
frequency if the parent thought the child didn’t need as much medicine as prescribed, which 
suggests that providers could specifically probe parents’ perceptions of this issue as a means 
of identifying patients who are using less medication than providers intended.
Strengths of our study include a diverse population of children from five geographic 
locations around the country, the completion of surveys from both providers and parents in 
order to compare understanding of controller medicine regimens, and the ability to link 
information from parent and provider surveys to claims data. Limitations of our study 
include the inability to distinguish between Latino subgroups and the fact that only two 
locations offered participation in Spanish. HPHC and Vanderbilt offered the survey in 
Spanish, but the other three sites excluded non-English speaking respondents, which meant 
we could not access this population. This is an important demographic to access because 
these parents may experience greater difficulties communicating with their providers, 
resulting in increased misalignment between provider recommendations and parental action. 
Additionally, parent gender was not evaluated, though it is possible that differences in 
asthma medicine adherence emerge between mothers and fathers. Furthermore, we were 
unable to be sure that the parents and providers were referring to the same controller 
medication , although we believe there is high probability that the parents and providers 
referred to the same controller medication prescription because we interviewed the providers 
whom the parents identified as the asthma provider. Moreover, we identified and asked about 
the most recent prescription. The vast majority of controller medications reported by parents 
and providers matched, supporting the likelihood that parents and providers were referring 
to the same prescription. Moreover, in our observational study, we were unable to assess 
causality. For example, when we found that a mismatch between parent and provider report 
of the prescribed frequency of controller medication use was associated with the parent 
believing their child did not need as much medicine as prescribed, reverse causation is 
possible as mismatches and subsequent medication non-adherence could lead to more poorly 
controlled asthma in children.

 In conclusion, a substantial number of providers prescribe asthma controller medicines less 
frequently than recommended by evidence-based guidelines, particularly for ICS. In 
addition, half of parents of children with asthma reported controller medicine regimens that 
were mismatched with their providers’ reported recommendations. Efforts to increase use of 
controller medicines for asthma may need to focus on provider, parent and patient 
communications and understanding of controller medicine regimens.

What is already known about this topic?
Underuse of controller medicines among children with persistent asthma remains 
widespread despite clear national guidelines and quality measures.
What does this article add to our knowledge?
Providers do not recommend that inhaled steroids be used according to national 
guidelines. Mismatches between parent reports and providers’ intentions regarding how 
the child was supposed to use inhaled steroids occurred in half of children.
How does this study impact current management guidelines?
Efforts to increase use of controller medicines for asthma should focus on ways to align 
provider decision-making with national guidelines and ways to reduce mismatches 
between parent and provider intentions regarding controller medication use.
