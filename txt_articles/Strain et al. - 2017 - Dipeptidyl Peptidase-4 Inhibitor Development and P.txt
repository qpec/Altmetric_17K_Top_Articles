T
he last decade has witnessed the role of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors in producing a conceptual change in early 
management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by shifting emphasis from a gluco-centric approach to holistically treating underlying 
pathophysiological processes. DPP-4 inhibitors highlighted the importance of acknowledging hypoglycaemia and weight gain as 
barriers to optimised care in T2DM. These complications were an integral part of diabetes management before the introduction of DPP-4 
inhibitors. During the development of DPP-4 inhibitors, regulatory requirements for introducing new agents underwent substantial changes, 
with increased emphasis on safety. This led to the systematic collection of adjudicated cardiovascular (CV) safety data, and, where 95% 
confidence of a lack of harm could not be demonstrated, the standardised CV safety studies. Furthermore, the growing awareness of the 
worldwide extent of T2DM demanded a more diverse approach to recruitment and participation in clinical trials. Finally, the global financial 
crisis placed a new awareness on the health economics of diabetes, which rapidly became the most expensive disease in the world. 
 
This review encompasses unique developments in the global landscape, and the role DPP-4 inhibitors, specifically vildagliptin, have played 
in research advancement and optimisation of diabetes care in a diverse population with T2DM worldwide.

Today, almost 90 years after La Barre and Still first described the 
physiological effects of a substance they later named ‘incretin’,1 therapies 
based on such gastrointestinal peptides have become an integral part 
of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) management. The discovery of the 
insulinotropic role of incretins and their impact on the entero-insular 
axis,2,3 were soon followed by a conclusion that glucagon-like peptide-1 
(GLP-1) was the most potent incretin in humans.4 Its ability to normalise 
glucose levels in people with T2DM without risk of hypoglycaemia, was 
subsequently established, highlighting its clinical potential.5 The discovery 
of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4)6 and its role in the degradation of GLP-
17 provided the foundation to augment treatment of diabetes.8 In 1998 a 
compound, now known as vildagliptin was synthesised and its entry into 
early clinical trials in human subjects marked a point when its unique 
journey from a conceptual discovery to causing a revolutionary change 
in management of T2DM commenced.9–11
Management of T2DM at the turn of the  
twentieth century
Before discussing the development of DPP-4 inhibitors further, however, 
the contemporaneous setting of treatment for diabetes must be 
considered. The UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS)12 had reported 
an unexpectedly dramatic effect of hypertension management, 
whilst conventional glycaemic control had failed to reduce mortality 
due to major cardiovascular (CV) events, whereas metformin, only 
recently licensed in the US, had reduced mortality and T2DM-related 
outcomes.13 The first thiazolidinedione, troglitazone, had been licensed, 
launched and withdrawn.14,15 Despite its short time on the shelves, it 
had contributed substantially to understanding the aetiopathogenic 
‘triumvirate’ of impaired pancreatic insulin secretion and insulin 
resistance in the muscle and liver.16,17 The subsequent 10 years 
witnessed the introduction of rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, followed

by the temporary suspension of rosiglitazone due to a perceived 
increase in CV risk.18 Subsequently, the US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) mandated companies to empirically demonstrate CV safety for 
all new anti-hyperglycaemic agents. This came juxtaposed with the 
ACCORD (NCT00000620) study demonstrating a lack of benefit and 
possible increase in CV risk from intensive glycaemic control in patients 
with long-term sustained hyperglycaemia.19 ADVANCE (NCT00949286)20 
and VADT (NCT00032487)21 did not show a corresponding increase 
 
in cardiac death, nor did they demonstrate any substantial reductions in 
 
diabetes-related events.20 Nevertheless, a paradigm shift had arrived; 
from targeting aggressive glucose lowering to avoiding adverse events, 
such as hypoglycaemia and weight gain with a significant adverse 
metabolic impact. This was only possible due to the introduction of 
pharmacological interventions, restoring the natural physiology of 
glucose regulation. Indeed, it was only through the longer-term studies 
that these events were determined to be adverse drug reactions rather 
than inevitable complications of progressive T2DM. Introducing the new 
composite outcome, percentage of patients achieving glycaemic target 
without weight gain and hypoglycaemia soon became the standard in 
studies of DPP-4 inhibitors and subsequent new classes.22–25
As a class, the DPP-4 inhibitors were the first agents required to abide 
by the new FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) regulatory 
requirements to demonstrate CV safety. A unique feature of the vildagliptin 
development programme had been the independent adjudication of all CV 
events, enabling a systematic meta-analysis even prior to the mandate 
reflecting the same requirements. The remaining DPP-4 inhibitors were 
requested to demonstrate CV safety after receiving regulatory (provisional) 
approval. Interestingly, demonstrating CV safety in high-risk individuals, 
with dedicated CV outcomes trials (CVOT), proved more formidable than 
the previous studies targeting a benefit. The DPP-4 inhibitors established 
new standards for the design and endpoints of CVOT safety studies and 
demonstrated the strain in meeting the criteria for a systematic meta-
analysis. The standardisation of major adverse CV events (MACE) resulted 
in the three-factor composite outcome of cardiac death, non-fatal 
myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke. This ‘3-point MACE’ excluded 
a fourth potential event, hospitalisation for acute coronary syndrome, due 
to its subjective nature. In order to achieve the stipulated tight confidence 
intervals (CI) required to demonstrate CV safety,26 these studies became 
a massive undertaking in terms of resources. Many questioned the 
relevance of such investment, which was inevitably reflected in the cost of 
the agents, merely to demonstrate non-inferiority compared with placebo, 
rather than more clinically relevant explorations of methods to improve 
the care of people with diabetes.27 For example, the trial evaluating CV 
outcomes with sitagliptin (TECOS; NCT00790205) study enrolled 14,671 
patients over several years to demonstrate sitagliptin usage had exactly 
the same CV event rates as placebo in addition to conventional care, with 
a hazard ratio of 1.0 and 95% CI of 0.83–1.20.28
New standards, new populations
In addition to the CV safety requirements, the growing worldwide burden 
of T2DM presented new socio-economical, psychological and cultural 
challenges for the development of drugs. It was no longer sufficient simply 
to demonstrate a favourable benefit–risk ratio for DPP-4 inhibitors within 
the typical Western European or American populations of the ACCORD,19 
ADVANCE,20 and VADT21 trials, or even different ethnicities29 but the 
clinical utility of the class was to be established in populations united by 
characteristics beyond pathophysiology, namely cultural and religious habits.
Globally, there are 148 million people with diabetes who follow Islam 
and up to 80% of them fast during the Holy month of Ramadan every 
year.30 Long periods of fasting and extreme changes in nutrition and 
fluid intake, during fasting and feasting, leads to a 7.5-fold increased 
risk of severe hypoglycaemia during the Holy month compared with 
non-fasting months.31 The advent of agents’ physiologically controlling 
hyperglycaemia with a low risk of hypoglycaemia enabled, for the first 
time, fasting Muslims to have symptomatic benefit of better glucose 
control without the devastating consequences of hypoglycaemia. 
 
An audit the year after the launch of vildagliptin demonstrated an 87% 
reduction in hypoglycaemic episodes compared with the standard care 
at the time, gliclazide,32 triggering a series of observational studies33,34 
and a subsequent interventional study.35 Studies demonstrated a distinct 
reduction in hypoglycaemia compared with gliclazide or all sulphonylureas 
(SUs), for vildagliptin and sitagliptin,36 respectively; although in an a priori 
analysis of sitagliptin compared to gliclazide, there was no difference in 
hypoglycaemia.36 As a result, DPP-4 inhibitors became the recommended 
treatment of choice for people preparing for Ramadan.37
Managing diabetes in older adults
Older adults are fundamentally different in terms of their responses to 
stimuli, whether external, endocrine or paracrine, from younger adults. 
Despite an acceptance of these variances, older adults were routinely 
excluded from earlier interventional studies. Worldwide, almost a third of 
the population with diabetes are over the age of 65,38–40 many of whom 
are undiagnosed.41 In institutional care, this undiagnosed population 
rises to approximately one in four.41 The high prevalence of T2DM in the 
very elderly is excluded from the worldwide estimates,42 likewise, these 
patients are mostly excluded from clinical trials.43,44
The INdividualising Targets for EldeRly patient using Vildagliptin as Add-on 
or Lone therapy (INTERVAL) study was the first to not only demonstrate 
safety and efficacy of DPP-4 inhibitors exclusively in older adults beyond 
the age of 70 (with no upper limit), but also to explore the processes 
and the success of personalised target setting.45 In this elderly cohort, 
in which the oldest patient was 97 years old, the adjusted odds ratio 
of achieving the individualised targets was 3.16 (96.2% CI 1.81–5.52; 
p<0.0001) (see Figure 1) in favour of vildagliptin.45 Surprisingly, men were 
set more aggressive targets than women (p=0.026; Figure 2), whereas 
setting targets according to the frailty status demonstrated only a trend 
towards significance (p=0.068).46 In non-frail patients, the baseline weight 
predicted a less aggressive glycaemic target setting (p=0.012), while 
astonishingly, glycaemic targets were not adjusted according to the body 
weight in frail patients (p=0.725; Figure 3).46
The INTERVAL study was conducted before any national guidelines 
advocated individualising therapeutic goals. While demonstrating 
a similar tolerability and glycaemic efficacy in older adults, as had 
previously been demonstrated for younger adults, it paradoxically 
reported that physicians’ target setting was predominantly driven by 
local guidance and baseline glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), rather than

Managing the ultimately challenging populations 
with T2DM – those with renal disease
The launch of DPP-4 inhibitors coincided with the introduction of the 
National Kidney Foundation (NKF) Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality 
Initiative (NKF KDOQI) characterisation of T2DM and renal disease, which 
acknowledged that almost a third of people with diabetes had some 
degree of nephropathy characterised by proteinuria and/or a reduced 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).47 The identification of these 
individuals dramatically limited the potential therapeutic options, given 
metformin, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, and the majority of SUs were 
contraindicated. The associated weight gain and fluid retention with 
pioglitazone, although licensed, made it a less attractive therapeutic 
alternative for people with renal impairment and the use of short-acting 
insulins and SUs in those with reduced eGFR significantly increases 
the risk of hypoglycaemia due to unpredictable accumulation.48 The 
physiological action of DPP-4 inhibitors, however, provided a suitable 
alternative to be explored in renal impairment. As a result, detailed 
pharmacokinetic (PK) studies were performed with all agents,49 followed 
by clinically meaningful studies, even in high doses, particularly in Asian 
patients undergoing haemodialysis.50
The PK profile of vildagliptin demonstrated reassuringly a very similar 
maximum serum insulin concentration (Cmax) but doubling of exposure 
in those with moderate to severe renal impairment. This allowed a 
reduction in dosing frequency to once daily, while retaining equivalent 
glycaemic benefits, for effectively half the price.51–53 And as predicted, 
similarly to the other DPP-4 inhibitors, a large, randomised, one-year trial 
demonstrated lack of progressive loss of eGFR over time versus placebo: 
annual eGFR change following vildagliptin and placebo treatment was 
−1.62 and −1.80 ml/min/1.73 m2, −1.98 and −2.44 ml/min/1.73 m2 in 
patients with moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively.53
The clinical utility and safety of other DPP-4 inhibitors was similarly 
demonstrated with appropriate dose reductions (with the exception 
of linagliptin which requires no dose adjustment due to its hepatic 
excretion) due to tendency towards an increased Cmax
22–25,54–56 It is, however, 
important to recognise that the non-renal excretion did not make 
linagliptin any more safe than other DPP-4 inhibitors as its fundamental 
mechanism of action is similar.57 However, a post hoc meta-analysis with 
linagliptin initially suggested a glucose-independent reduction in albumin 
excretion rate (AER) of 32%,58 originally hypothesised due to a direct anti-
inflammatory effect of the molecule’s xanthine ring. Nevertheless, a 
mechanistic study with vildagliptin demonstrated a similar 44% reduction 
in AER over an 8-week period.59 Similarly, the CVOTs of other DPP-4 
inhibitors demonstrated a greater AER reduction than placebo, despite 
glycaemic equipoise.60,61 The reduction in AER is presumably a direct 
effect of active GLP-1 on the renal receptors, supported by the reduction 
in micro- and macroalbuminuria in the LEADER (NCT01179048) study.62 
The MARLINA (NCT01792518) study, however, comparing linagliptin to 
placebo in those with pre-existing renal impairment, failed to confirm a 
glucose-independent benefit.63
Clinical experience with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 
inhibitors in the real-world
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have high internal validity, enrol 
selected, highly motivated subjects with few, but optimally managed 
co-morbidities, and tend to run over a short time frame in developed 
countries with frequent and prolonged follow-up visits. The launch of DPP-
4 inhibitors coincided with increasing awareness of the disparity between 
the results from RCTs and the efficacy observed in the general clinical 
practice; highlighting an unmet need to explore the use of the newer agents 
in more diverse populations worldwide, in presence of co-morbidities, over 
a longer period in ‘real-world’ and variable resource settings.
The first, and most comprehensive real-world study with a DPP-4 
inhibitors was the Effectiveness of Diabetes control with vildaGliptin 
and vildagliptin/mEtformin (EDGE) study, enrolling over 45,000 patients 
in 27 countries and five regions.64 This study uniquely represented the 
worldwide, everyday challenges of managing diabetes. Investigators 
chose to intensify the failing monotherapy, at their discretion, based on 
parameters they considered relevant, introducing comparators to dual 
therapy with vildagliptin consisting mostly of metformin-SU or metformin-
pioglitazone combinations. Rather unexpectedly, the DPP-4 inhibitor was 
not only providing the expected HbA1c reduction of 1.19% over 12 months 
but also demonstrating superiority at every time point over the year, 
predominantly due to ‘underperformance’ of the comparators, mostly 
SUs.65 This divergence between the RCT data and real-world evidence was 
potentially induced by slow titration implemented for SUs, from initiation 
to optimal target dose in keeping with routine clinical practice. Further, 
under-diagnosed hypoglycaemia in this real-world setting contributed to 
under-recognised non-adherence.
The EDGE study also validated the role of real-world evidence for 
demonstration of regional differences,66 lack of extensive epidemiological 
data around hotspots of T2DM67 and, most of all, magnitude of 
 
clinical inertia affecting second-line therapy intensification.67 Physician

preferences,68 gender discrimination and regional differences in 
prescription habits for newer but also older oral anti-diabetes drugs 
(OADs) or worldwide resistance to insulin initiations69 were also some 
of the key findings of EDGE. Simultaneously, EDGE has provided a 
unique foundation for cost-effectiveness analyses with patient-level 
data.70 These data were instrumental in assessing the health economic 
(HE) value of the DPP-4 inhibitors worldwide without simulations and 
modelling based on RCTs.
Health economics in the real-world setting
The launch of the DPP-4 inhibitors coincided with the global recession 
of 2007, which substantially changed the HE approach for newer 
drugs. Traditionally, cost-effectiveness evaluations were based on 
HbA1c reductions in RCTs and the relative value of such extrapolated 
from UKPDS data. This practice, however, often did not capture the 
differences in demographics, clinical profiles, motivation, socio-
economic and cultural factors in the real-world.71 Further, the RCT 
data were predominantly placebo-controlled, which did not allow for 
direct inter-agent comparisons. The availability of patient-level data 
from a real-world setting enabled HE models to implement improved 
external validity, mimicking the EDGE study, and perform inter-drug 
comparisons between DPP-4 inhibitor and the then standard of care, 
SU. The estimated total costs, and change in HbA1c between baseline 
and one year estimates for metformin in combination with either 
vildagliptin or SUs as per the EDGE and National Institute for Health and 
Care Excellence approaches are summarised in Figure 4. The results 
suggested that guidelines basing their estimates on data from RCTs 
may underestimate the HE value of modern treatments such as DPP-4 
inhibitors.72 Furthermore, real-world data suggested vildagliptin would 
be associated with a reduction in the cumulative incidence of major 
micro- and macrovascular complications, increase in quality-adjusted 
life expectation and delaying the need for insulin,73,74 all principle drivers 
of expenditure in diabetes.75–77 It is important here to differentiate 
between the most frequent real-world use of DPP-4 inhibitor (i.e., as an 
early add-on mostly to metformin and in people with a relatively low CV 
risk) versus secondary preventative profile addressed in the CVOTs, as 
early treatment intensification and reduction in HbA1c without weight 
gain or hypoglycaemia would translate into the ultimate treatment goal: 
long-term prevention of complications of diabetes.
The future of diabetes, with dipeptidyl 
peptidase-4 inhibitors
Over the last decade, DPP-4 inhibitors have played a critical role in the 
innovative design of and advance in clinical trials, setting standards 
for both RCTs and non-interventional studies and in new, diverse 
populations living with T2DM.64,78 Nevertheless, several past paradigms 
based on historical studies, such as the UKPDS, still define and set 
standards for expectations managing people with diabetes in a stepwise 
manner. In addition, the persistently progressive nature of the underlying 
disease, partially attributable to the non-modifiable risk factors, but 
also current diabetes treatment paradigm characterised by ineffective 
lifestyle interventions, followed by (often delayed) monotherapy and 
frequent early treatment failure with prolonged periods of sustained 
hyperglycaemia, become inevitable consequences of sequential clinical 
inertia. Thus, it is most appropriate to re-think the current treatment 
paradigm for T2DM in the context of a more aggressive initial therapy; 
specifically with early initiation of combination therapy addressing the 
key pathophysiological defects driving the underlying disease.
The Vildagliptin Efficacy in combination with metfoRmIn For earlY 
treatment of T2DM (VERIFY) study explores the clinical benefits of 
early combination in 2,000 newly diagnosed people with T2DM and 
mild hyperglycaemia (HbA1c between 6.5% and 7.5% at baseline) by 
comparing a monotherapy strategy based on metformin, established 
standard of care, with early combination of vildagliptin and metformin.79 
Initiating dual therapy from the outset, the results will determine whether 
this translates into durability and long-term benefits such as delayed 
time to initial treatment failure or time to insulin. For the first time, an 
extended follow-up of this study will explore the potential benefit of 
the aggressive early intervention compared to the more ‘real-world’ 
approach plagued with clinical inertia. VERIFY will, in addition, explore 
early changes in the vasculature of patients with T2DM, thus addressing 
primary clinical objective for treatment of hyperglycaemia. The results of 
VERIFY will be reported in 2019.80
Failure to escalate therapy, when appropriate, has been an unfortunate 
feature of diabetes management for many years.81 Indeed, today in 
the UK only one in five people achieves adequate glycaemic, blood 
pressure and lipid control, leading to as many as 24,000 premature 
unnecessary deaths a year.1,82 The advent of well-tolerated statins and 
modern anti-hypertensive agents have accelerated improvements in 
care, however, glycaemic control has remained a hurdle to optimised 
care. This is, in part, due to the tolerability issues, weight gain and 
hypoglycaemia associated with traditional treatment alternatives. 
These adversely affect quality of life by approximately the same 
degree as is gained by improving HbA1c by 1% (11 mmol/mol), and 
therefore affect adherence to the hypoglycaemic regimen.83 The late 
introduction and escalation of agents, however, may be even more 
detrimental, with hyperglycaemia causing early epigenetic changes 
that perpetuate vascular inflammation long after glucose has been 
brought under control.84 Thus, access to well-tolerated agents via 
sustainable access programmes,85 not limited to DPP-4 inhibitors such 
as vildagliptin, may provide benefits beyond the direct impact of their 
anti-hyperglycaemic effect by removing one of the principle barriers to 
appropriate escalation of care.
Evidently, treatment optimisation is only applicable where the agents 
with acceptable benefit–risk ratio are affordable and accessible. The 
International Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimates that 86% of young 
adults with diabetes live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)

Conclusions
The last decade has witnessed the DPP-4 inhibitors take centre stage, 
especially in the early management of T2DM. They produced a conceptual 
change in disease management, with the emphasis moving from a 
gluco-centric approach to treating the underlying pathophysiological 
processes. During their development, DPP-4 inhibitors pioneered 
the mechanistic studies, CV safety trials, demonstrating safety but 
also individualisation of treatment targets or understanding the 
clinical challenges faced when managing special populations, such as 
 
those with renal failure, elderly adults or those fasting as part of 
Ramadan, real-world studies, and newer HE appraisals in a changing 
backdrop of regulatory requirements and financial pressures. Vildagliptin 
 
was the pioneer of its class, first to be entering an extensive clinical 
development programme and since then it has been at the forefront of 
research and development for the class and for the changing diabetes 
landscape worldwide. ❑
