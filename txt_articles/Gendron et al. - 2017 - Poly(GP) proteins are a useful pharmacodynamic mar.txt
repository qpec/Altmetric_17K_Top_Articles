There is no effective treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a devastating motor neuron disease.
However, discovery of a G4C2 repeat expansion in the C9ORF72 gene as the most common genetic cause of
ALS has opened up new avenues for therapeutic intervention for this form of ALS. G4C2 repeat expansion RNAs
and proteins of repeating dipeptides synthesized from these transcripts are believed to play a key role in
C9ORF72-associated ALS (c9ALS). Therapeutics that target G4C2 RNA, such as antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs)
and small molecules, are thus being actively investigated. A limitation in moving such treatments from bench to
bedside is a lack of pharmacodynamic markers for use in clinical trials. We explored whether poly(GP) proteins
translated from G4C2 RNA could serve such a purpose. Poly(GP) proteins were detected in cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from c9ALS patients and, notably, from asymptomatic C9ORF72
mutation carriers. Moreover, CSF poly(GP) proteins remained relatively constant over time, boding well for their
use in gauging biochemical responses to potential treatments. Treating c9ALS patient cells or a mouse model of
c9ALS with ASOs that target G4C2 RNA resulted in decreased intracellular and extracellular poly(GP) proteins.
This decrease paralleled reductions in G4C2 RNA and downstream G4C2 RNA–mediated events. These findings
indicate that tracking poly(GP) proteins in CSF could provide a means to assess target engagement of G4C2
RNA–based therapies in symptomatic C9ORF72 repeat expansion carriers and presymptomatic individuals
who are expected to benefit from early therapeutic intervention.
INTRODUCTION
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressive motor neu-
ron disease that typically results in muscle atrophy, paralysis, and even-
tually death within 5 years of onset. Up to 50% of ALS patients develop
cognitive and behavioral impairments, and ~15% fulfill the criteria for
frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which is characterized by changes in
personality, behavior, and language (1).
Only one minimally effective drug, riluzole, is approved for ALS
despite more than 30 clinical trials conducted since 1995. The dearth
of ALS therapeutics stems partly from an incomplete understanding of
the causative pathomechanisms. However, discovery of a G4C2 repeat
expansion in the C9ORF72 gene as the most common genetic cause of
ALS and FTD (2, 3) has resulted in impressive efforts toward elucidat-
ing how this mutation causes c9ALS (C9ORF72-associated ALS) or
c9FTD, collectively referred to as c9ALS/FTD. Although the normal
number of C9ORF72 G4C2 repeats is lower than 30, c9ALS/FTD pa-
tients have several hundred to several thousand (4). Putative pathomech-
anisms associated with G4C2 repeat expansions include loss of C9ORF72
function as well as toxicity stemming from the accumulation of sense
and antisense transcripts of the expanded repeats. These RNA tran-
scripts assemble into structures called foci, aberrantly interact with
RNA binding proteins, and cause defects in nucleocytoplasmic trans-
port (5, 6). They additionally serve as templates for the synthesis of
proteins of repeating dipeptides through repeat associated non-ATG
(RAN) translation (7–11). Poly(GP), poly(GA), and poly(GR) proteins
are produced from sense G4C2-containing transcripts, whereas poly(GP),
poly(PA), and poly(PR) proteins are produced from antisense G2C4-
containing transcripts. Neuronal inclusions of these so-called c9RAN

 proteins are pathognomonic to c9ALS/FTD, and studies show that
certain c9RAN proteins, such as poly(GA), poly(GR), and poly(PR),
are toxic in in vitro and in vivo overexpression models (5, 6). Potential
mechanisms of toxicity associated with c9RAN proteins include nucle-
olar stress, impaired proteasomal function, and, as with G4C2 repeat
RNA, impaired nucleocytoplasmic transport (5, 6).
On the basis of the expanding body of evidence supporting the
role of G4C2 repeat RNA and c9RAN proteins in c9ALS/FTD patho-
genesis, therapeutic approaches that target G4C2 RNA are being ac-
tively pursued. For example, antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs)
complementary to G4C2 RNA or C9ORF72 transcripts (c9ASOs) de-
crease G4C2-containing RNA and consequently decrease the number
of cells with RNA foci, as well as mitigate abnormalities in gene ex-
pression and nucleocytoplasmic transport in neurons differentiated
from c9ALS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)
(12–14). In primary neurons and brain tissues from c9BAC mice express-
ing expanded G4C2 repeats, c9ASOs decrease G4C2 repeat–containing
RNA, foci formation, and production of poly(GP) proteins (15, 16).
Moreover, small-molecule binders of G4C2 RNA inhibit foci forma-
tion and RAN translation in patient-derived cell models (17).
Because possible therapeutics for c9ALS/FTD are being developed
for clinical trials, it is paramount to address barriers in moving a treat-
ment from bench to bedside. Chief among these is the lack of markers
capable of predicting disease progression, monitoring the response to
therapy, and confirming target engagement. Given that c9RAN proteins
are synthesized from G4C2 repeat RNA, the target of therapeutic in-
terventions under investigation, we anticipate that c9RAN proteins
in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will reflect target engagement and bio-
chemical responses to treatment. Although three c9RAN proteins are
produced from G4C2 RNA, namely, poly(GP), poly(GA), and poly(GR),
we believe that poly(GP) may be an especially suitable marker candi-
date. Both poly(GP) and poly(GA) are more highly expressed in the
central nervous system (CNS) of c9ALS/FTD patients than poly(GR)
(18). However, poly(GP) is more likely to be accurately measured in
biospecimens because it is more soluble than poly(GA) (19). Indeed,
in a small cohort of c9ALS patients, we established that poly(GP) can
be detected in CSF (17). Thus, to prepare for upcoming clinical trials
for c9ALS, the present study used patient CSF and several preclinical
models to investigate the hypothesis that poly(GP) proteins could
serve as an urgently needed pharmacodynamic marker for developing
and testing therapies for treating c9ALS.
RESULTS
Poly(GP) is detected in the CSF of asymptomatic and
symptomatic C9ORF72 repeat expansion carriers
To test our hypothesis, we used an international sampling of subjects
(table S1) to (i) replicate our finding that poly(GP) is present in CSF
from C9ORF72 mutation carriers (17), (ii) compare poly(GP) proteins
in CSF between asymptomatic and symptomatic carriers, and (iii)
examine the longitudinal profile of CSF poly(GP). Given these three
primary analyses, P ≤ 0.017 was considered significant after Bonferroni
adjustment.
Our CSF series comprised samples from 83 c9ALS patients [71
with c9ALS alone and 12 with comorbid FTD (c9ALS-FTD)] and
27 asymptomatic C9ORF72 repeat expansion carriers. CSF col-
lected longitudinally was available for 33 of these subjects. Also in-
cluded were samples from 24 C9ORF72 repeat expansion carriers
clinically diagnosed with diseases other than c9ALS or c9ALS-FTD
[c9FTD (n = 20), Alzheimer’s disease (n = 2), bipolar disease (n = 1),
and dementia with Lewy bodies (n = 1)] and from 120 individuals
without the C9ORF72 mutation. The latter encompassed patients
with ALS (n = 57) or other neurological diseases [FTD (n = 4),
Alzheimer’s disease (n = 10), and primary lateral sclerosis (n = 1)],
as well as healthy controls (n = 48). Subject characteristics are pro-
vided in Table 1.
Poly(GP) in CSF was measured in a blinded manner using our pre-
viously described Meso Scale Discovery–based immunoassay (17, 19).
We have validated that measures of poly(GP) in CSF determined using
this assay significantly correlate with measures of poly(GP) assessed
using a different antibody pair (Spearman’s r = 0.99, P < 0.0001, n =
14; fig. S1A) or using a different immunoassay platform, the Simoa
HD-1 Analyzer (Spearman’s r = 0.98, P < 0.0001, n = 14; fig. S1B).
As anticipated on the basis of our previous study of 14 c9ALS
patients (17), poly(GP) was detected in CSF from C9ORF72 muta-
tion carriers in the large sample series used in the present study (Fig.
1A, Table 1, and tables S2 to S4). Poly(GP) proteins were significantly
higher in individuals with the expansion (n = 134) than in those with-
out (n = 120) in unadjusted analysis (P < 0.0001) and analyses adjusted
for age at CSF collection, gender, and disease group (P < 0.0001).
Notably, poly(GP) was detected in CSF from both asymptomatic
and symptomatic C9ORF72 mutation carriers (Fig. 1B, Table 1,
and table S2). In comparing asymptomatic individuals (n = 27)
and patients with c9ALS or c9ALS-FTD (n = 83), there was nominal

 evidence of higher poly(GP) in the symptomatic subgroup (median,
0.8 ng/ml versus 0.5 ng/ml; P = 0.047), but this did not remain sig-
nificant after correction for multiple comparisons or when adjust-
ing for age at CSF collection and gender (P = 0.42) (Fig. 1B and
tables S3 and S5).
CSF poly(GP) is stable over time
We next evaluated whether CSF poly(GP) changes over time in
asymptomatic (n = 9) C9ORF72 mutation carriers and patients
with c9ALS or c9ALS-FTD (n = 24) (Fig. 2 and table S6). For these
33 subjects for whom longitudinally collected CSF was available,
the median length of time between the first and last poly(GP) mea-
surement was 12.9 months (range, 4.4 to 22.6 months); 24 subjects
had two measurements, 6 had three measurements, 2 had four
measurements, and 1 had five measurements. As depicted in Fig. 2,
poly(GP) concentrations for a given individual remained largely con-
stant. Although variations were seen in some subjects, there was no
evidence of a significant change in poly(GP) over the time frame
examined (P = 0.84).
Poly(GP) is not a prognostic marker
To gain insight into potential relationships between CSF poly(GP) and
patient characteristics, we made 10 secondary comparisons. We first
examined associations between poly(GP) in patients with c9ALS or
c9ALS-FTD and either age at CSF collection, time from disease onset
Table 1. Subject characteristics according to C9ORF72 repeat expansion status and disease group. The sample median (minimum, 25th percentile, 75th
percentile, and maximum) is given for continuous variables. The 15 subjects without a C9ORF72 repeat expansion in the “Other diseases” subgroup
comprised 4 patients with FTD, 10 with Alzheimer’s disease, and 1 with primary lateral sclerosis. The 24 subjects with a C9ORF72 repeat expansion in the “Other
diseases” subgroup comprised 20 patients with FTD, 2 with Alzheimer’s disease, 1 with dementia with Lewy bodies, and 1 diagnosed with bipolar disease.
Information was unavailable regarding age of disease onset [n = 12; 11 non-C9ORF72 repeat expansion carriers (n = 1 with ALS and n = 10 with a disease other
than ALS or ALS-FTD) and 1 C9ORF72 repeat expansion carrier with FTD], disease onset to CSF collection (n = 11; 10 non-C9ORF72 repeat expansion carriers with
a disease other than ALS or ALS-FTD and 1 C9ORF72 repeat expansion carrier with FTD), and onset site (n = 3; one c9ALS and two c9ALS-FTD). For ALSFRS-R
scores, data were missing from 10 ALS or ALS-FTD patients without the C9ORF72 repeat expansion, 19 asymptomatic subjects with the expansion, and 23
patients with c9ALS or c9ALS-FTD. N/A, not applicable.

Downloaded from 
 to CSF collection, or gender. Only gender showed a significant asso-
ciation with poly(GP), with levels being lower in females compared
to males (P = 0.004; table S7).
In evaluating associations between CSF poly(GP) and age at dis-
ease onset, onset site, disease group (c9ALS versus c9ALS-FTD), or
ALSFRS-R (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale –
Revised) score (an indicator of the functional status of ALS patients;
fig. S2A), no associations were found (table S7). We also investigated
whether poly(GP) associates with survival after disease onset. Of the
83 patients with c9ALS or c9ALS-FTD, 79 had survival data. The
median length of follow-up after disease onset was 3.3 years (range,
1.0 to 11.8 years), and 47 patients (60%) died. No association between
poly(GP) and survival after disease onset was observed in unadjusted
analysis [hazard ratio (HR) per each doubling, 0.94; 95% confidence
interval (CI), 0.77 to 1.15; P = 0.55] or when adjusting for age at
disease onset, gender, and onset site (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.17;
P = 0.60).
The findings above are in line with our observation that poly(GP)
proteins in the frontal cortex or cerebellum do not associate with age
at disease onset or survival after onset (19). However, we did find that
cerebellar poly(GP) is associated with cognitive impairment in c9ALS
patients (19). We thus examined whether CSF poly(GP) similarly
correlated with cognitive or behavioral impairment. Patients with
c9ALS or c9ALS-FTD seen at the Mayo Clinic or the National Institutes
of Health (NIH) were included in these studies. These patients were
systematically screened for cognitive and behavioral function using
a battery of validated neuropsychological tests (table S8). Each sub-
ject was scored as normal or impaired with respect to behavior (n =
29) or cognition (n = 30) based on test scores by evaluators blinded
to poly(GP) status. There was no significant difference in CSF poly(GP)
between subjects with or without behavioral impairment (fig. S2B and
tables S7 and S9). CSF poly(GP) trended higher in patients with cog-
nitive impairment compared to those without (median, 1.5 versus 0.5;
P = 0.018), but this finding lost significance when adjusting for age at
CSF collection, gender, and years of education (P = 0.12; fig. S2C and
tables S7 and S10).
Poly(GP) in immortalized peripheral blood mononuclear cells
reflects a c9ASO-induced decrease in G4C2 repeat RNA
Our discovery that poly(GP) is detected in CSF from C9ORF72 ex-
pansion carriers, and that it is stable over 6 to 18 months, supports
the potential use of poly(GP) as a pharmacodynamic marker. To in-
vestigate this further, we used patient-derived cell models to probe
the utility of poly(GP) in gauging biochemical responses to therapeu-
tics that target G4C2 RNA. To this end, we first generated lympho-
blastoid cell lines by immortalizing peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMCs) from C9ORF72 mutation carriers, given our finding
that they express poly(GP) (Fig. 3A and tables S11 and S12). Nota-
bly, poly(GP) was detected in lysates from lymphoblastoid cell lines
from C9ORF72 mutation carriers and in media bathing these cells
(Fig. 3B), suggesting that poly(GP) is secreted from cells. As shown
in Fig. 3C, a significant correlation was observed between extracellular
and intracellular poly(GP) (Spearman’s r = 0.77, P = 0.004, n = 12).
Next, we treated one lymphoblastoid cell line from a c9ALS patient
and one line from an asymptomatic C9ORF72 mutation carrier with a
nontargeting control ASO or a ribonuclease H (RNase H)–active ASO
that targets G4C2 repeat RNA (c9ASO-1). Exposure of the two lym-
phoblastoid cell lines to 5 mM c9ASO-1 for 10 days almost completely
eliminated mRNA expression of C9ORF72 variants 1 and 3, the pre-
mRNA of which contain the repeat, but had no effect on C9ORF72
variant 2 for which the repeat is not transcribed (Fig. 3D). Also ob-
served was a significant reduction in the number of cells bearing foci
formed of G4C2 repeat RNA (Fig. 3E) and of poly(GP) in cell lysates
(Fig. 3F). The data indicate that poly(GP) production mirrors expression
of repeat-containing C9ORF72 transcripts in lymphoblastoid cell lines.
c9ASO treatment decreases intracellular and extracellular
poly(GP) in c9ALS iPSC-derived neurons
To validate our findings in a second patient-derived cell model, we used
neurons differentiated from c9ALS iPSCs (iPSNs), which recapitulate
the genetic, transcriptional, and biochemical signatures of c9ALS pa-
tient brain tissue (table S13) (12, 14). As a proxy for CSF, we examined
whether poly(GP) could be detected in conditioned media bathing
c9ALS iPSNs and whether levels of extracellular poly(GP) reflected
those of intracellular poly(GP), as was seen for lymphoblastoid cell
lines. As anticipated, poly(GP) was detected in cell lysates and media
from c9ALS iPSNs but not iPSNs lacking the repeat expansion (Fig.
4A). A significant correlation was observed between extracellular and
intracellular poly(GP) (Spearman’s r = 0.86, P = 0.02, n = 7; Fig. 4B).
Next, we treated three lines of c9ALS iPSNs for 20 days with control
ASO orwithan ASO that targetsintron 1ofC9ORF72(c9ASO-2)andthat
dose-dependentlydecreasesG4C2repeat–containingtranscripts(C9ORF72
variants1and3)whilehavinglimitedeffectontotalC9ORF72mRNA(Fig.
4C). Consistent with these results, intracellular poly(GP) was dose-
dependently decreased in c9ALS iPSN lysates after the 20-day c9ASO-2
treatment (Fig. 4D). Similarly, poly(GP) was reduced in media in a time-
and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4D). By 10 days of treatment, a signif-
icant decrease in extracellular poly(GP) was observed in cells exposed to
3 mM c9ASO-2 (P < 0.01), and by 15 days of treatment, a significant
decrease in poly(GP) was observed in media from cells treated with
0.3 mM c9ASO-2 (P < 0.01). Again, a significant correlation was seen be-
tween intracellular and extracellular poly(GP) (Spearman’s r = 0.99, P <
0.0001, n = 12; Fig. 4E). These data support the notion that extracellular
poly(GP) may serve as a surrogate marker for intracellular G4C2 RNA ac-
cumulation and suggest that extracellular poly(GP) in CSF can be used as a
pharmacodynamic marker for therapies that target G4C2 RNA.

 CSF poly(GP) associates with c9ASO-induced decreases in G4C2
repeat–containing RNA, foci burden, and c9RAN proteins in
mice expressing an expanded G4C2 repeat
To explore the use of extracellular poly(GP) as a pharmacodynamic
marker in vivo, we assessed the effects of c9ASO-1 on poly(GP) in mice
that expressed an expanded (G4C2)66 repeat through adeno-associated
virus transgenesis (20). We previously
reported that by 6 months of age, RNA
foci and c9RAN protein pathology were
prevalent in (G4C2)66 mice (20). There-
fore, at 4 to 4.5 months of age, a single bolus
of 500 mg of c9ASO-1 in phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS) or PBS alone was
delivered into the right ventricle of the
CNS of (G4C2)66 mice or control (G4C2)2
mice. Eight weeks later, CSF was collected
from mice, and the brains were harvested.
As shown in Fig. 5A, c9ASO-1 treatment
significantly decreased repeat-containing
mRNA in (G4C2)66 mice (P = 0.0004),
whereas it had no effect on endogenous
mouse C9orf72 mRNA (P = 0.85; Fig.
5B). As anticipated, a concomitant de-
crease in cells bearing RNA foci was seen
throughout the brain (Fig. 5C and fig.
S3A), with quantitative analysis of foci-
bearing cells in the motor cortex supporting
this observation (P < 0.0001; Fig. 5D).
Likewise, we noted a marked decrease in
the number of inclusions immunopositive
for poly(GR), poly(GA), or poly(GP)
(Fig. 5, E and F, and fig. S3B). Significant
reductions in poly(GA) (P = 0.0025) or
poly(GP) (P < 0.0001) in brain homoge-
nates, as assessed by immunoassay, were
also observed (Fig. 5G and fig. S4A). Of
particular importance, poly(GP) was de-
tected in CSF of (G4C2)66 mice, and CSF
poly(GP) was significantly decreased af-
ter c9ASO-1 treatment (P = 0.0035;
Fig. 5H and fig. S4B). CSF poly(GP)
not only correlated with brain poly(GP)
in (G4C2)66 mice treated or not treated
with c9ASO-1, but both CSF and brain
poly(GP) were associated with levels of
repeat-containing transcripts, the percent-
age of motor cortex cells bearing RNA foci,
and the amount of poly(GA) in brain
homogenates (Table 2).
DISCUSSION
Despite intense efforts, and more than 50
clinical trials conducted in the past half-
century, there remains only one minimal-
ly effective therapy for ALS, one of the most
rapidly progressive neurodegenerative
diseases. Drug development for ALS,
like for many neurological disorders,
is hampered by numerous factors, including an incomplete understand-
ing of the causative pathological mechanisms and the existence of dif-
ferent forms of the disease (for example, sporadic ALS versus ALS
caused by different gene mutations). Perhaps most important, trials
have been hindered by the lack of pharmacodynamic markers to
monitor target engagement and therapeutic efficacy. However, with

 the discovery of C9ORF72 G4C2 repeat expansions as a major cause of
ALS (2, 3), c9ALS may well become among the first forms of ALS with
a treatment, provided that a concerted effort is made to tackle multiple
aspects of the drug development process.
Strategies that target G4C2 repeat–containing RNA are actively
being explored as therapeutics for c9ALS/FTD based on the premise
that eliminating or neutralizing these transcripts will block detrimental
downstream events initiated by the transcripts themselves or by the
c9RAN proteins that they produce. As these approaches become
closer to clinical trials, the need for a means to measure target engage-
ment and biochemical responses to treatment becomes paramount.
Spurred by our findings that poly(GP) is associated with G4C2
repeat–containing transcripts in the cerebellum of C9ORF72 mutation
carriers (19, 21) and that small molecules, ASOs, and genetic modifiers
that target G4C2 repeat RNA attenuate poly(GP) production in yeast
(Saccharomyces cerevisiae), worms (Caenorhabditis elegans), c9ALS pa-
tient cell lines, and c9BAC mice (12, 14–17, 22, 23), the present study
examined the utility of poly(GP) as a pharmacodynamic marker. Through
the combined use of three model systems, we cross-validated our ob-
servation that extracellular poly(GP) mirrors intracellular levels and
confirmed that c9ASOs are potent inhibitors of c9ALS-associated de-
fects. The lymphoblastoid cell lines and iPSNs allowed us to study
poly(GP) as a marker in human models and under the genetic context
of the C9ORF72 mutation. A greater than 90% loss of poly(GP) was
observed in lymphoblastoid cell lines treated with 5 mM c9ASO-1 for
10 days and in iPSNs treated with 3 mM c9ASO-2 for 20 days. Al-
though both sense and antisense transcripts encode poly(GP), these
results suggest that sense transcripts are the dominant producer of
poly(GP) in these cells. Our (G4C2)66 mice provided an in vivo model
that enabled us to examine relationships between CSF poly(GP) and
c9ALS-associated features in brain tissue. We found that a single in-
tracerebroventricular injection of c9ASO-1 in (G4C2)66 mice resulted

 in robust decreases in c9RAN proteins and RNA foci in the brain,
despite their abundance in this model. Of particular importance, we
detected significant associations between CSF poly(GP) in (G4C2)66
mice and repeat RNA, frequency of foci, and c9RAN protein ex-
pression in mouse brain. Evaluating similar associations between
poly(GP) in antemortem CSF and neuropathological features in
postmortem brain from C9ORF72 mutation carriers will be an im-
portant future study.
The data from our preclinical models suggest that monitoring
poly(GP) before and during treatment of patients participating in clin-
ical trials presents a feasible approach to gauge target engagement. It is
thus noteworthy that CSF poly(GP) remained relatively stable over
intervals of 6 to 18 months, which is expected to facilitate the detec-
tion of c9ASO-induced changes in poly(GP), even in patients with rel-
atively low poly(GP). We do note that a few patients had very low
poly(GP). We are currently exploring alternative strategies that we ex-
pect will markedly increase assay sensitivity and dynamic range. How-
ever, should this not be the case, this issue will need to be taken into
consideration in the design of any clinical trial.
Our observation that CSF poly(GP) is detected in asymptomatic
C9ORF72 mutation carriers is consistent with the emergence of brain
c9RAN protein pathology before symptom onset (24). It also suggests
that the primary source of poly(GP) in CSF is not the release of this
protein from dying cells but rather its secretion from living cells. It is
also important to bear in mind that increases in CSF poly(GP) resulting
from neurodegeneration may be difficult to discern from steady-state
levels, given that c9RAN proteins are widely expressed throughout
the CNS of C9ORF72 mutation carriers (7), but a relatively small pro-
portion of cells degenerate in ALS relative to all cells of the brain. Con-
sequently, although our longitudinal studies suggest less utility for
poly(GP) as a marker of disease progression, they in no way dis-
count the potential contribution of G4C2 RNA, c9RAN proteins, or
downstream events to disease progression, nor do they affect the
utility of poly(GP) as a pharmacodynamic marker.
Many clinical trials for neurodegenerative disorders are believed to
have failed, at least in part, because treatment was not initiated suffi-
ciently early. Asymptomatic C9ORF72 carriers from a large family
with a history of ALS show changes in brain morphology outside
the primary motor cortex (25), and structural imaging studies of
asymptomatic adults at risk for c9FTD suggest that the thalamus and
posterior cortical areas are affected early, with the cerebellum also
showing presymptomatic involvement (26). These studies suggest that
the disease process precedes symptom onset; as such, asymptomatic
C9ORF72 mutation carriers represent a population likely to benefit
from early therapeutic intervention. That poly(GP) is detected in CSF
from asymptomatic C9ORF72 mutation carriers makes the inclusion
of these individuals in clinical trials for G4C2 RNA–targeting therapies
more practical by providing a pharmacodynamic marker.
When investigating potential relationships between CSF poly(GP)
and patient characteristics, we found that poly(GP) was higher in male
C9ORF72 mutation carriers compared to females. Although the bio-
logical significance of this modest difference in poly(GP) remains
unknown, it is intriguing that disease penetrance among C9ORF72
mutation carriers is reportedly higher in males (27, 28). We also de-
tected a trend of higher CSF poly(GP) in patients with c9ALS or
c9ALS-FTD compared to asymptomatic C9ORF72 mutation carriers,
but this finding was not statistically significant. We did observe one
asymptomatic individual with much higher CSF poly(GP) compared
to the others, and it will be of interest to follow this subject for signs of
onset of clinical disease in comparison to the other carriers. Because
our longitudinal studies included only nine asymptomatic individuals,
additional studies on repeated collections of CSF from asymptomatic
subjects are advisable to compare the trajectory of poly(GP) before
and after carriers convert to the symptomatic stage.
We additionally observed a trend of elevated CSF poly(GP) in c9ALS
patients with cognitive impairment, but this finding did not meet statis-
tical significance, perhaps because information on cognitive impairment
was available for only a small number of patients (n = 30). Although the
sample size accrued for these analyses is large for a study of C9ORF72
repeat expansion carriers, it is relatively small for conducting statistical
tests of association. As a result, power to detect differences in poly(GP)
between groups may be low, and there is a possibility of a type II error
(that is, a false-negative association). It should also be noted that our
study focused only on poly(GP) because of its abundance in the CNS
and its solubility (19). Although cerebellar poly(GP) was associated with
poly(GA) (19), and the same is true for poly(GP) and poly(GA) in
(G4C2)66 mouse brain (Table 2), measurements of CSF poly(GA) and
poly(GR), which show evidence of toxicity (6), could uncover associa-
tions with clinical features not observed for poly(GP). Given our dis-
covery that poly(GP) is detected in PBMCs from C9ORF72 repeat
expansion carriers, cross-sectional and longitudinal studies examining
associations between PBMC c9RAN proteins and clinical features may
also uncover relationships of potential prognostic value. Also of im-
portance will be comparing poly(GP) in CSF to poly(GP) in PBMCs
from the same patient. Finally, the fact that G4C2 repeat length varies
among C9ORF72 mutation carriers, which presumably affects the length
of c9RAN proteins, must be considered. Because longer poly(GP) pro-
teins have more anti-GP antibody binding sites, this could influence

 poly(GP) quantification and comparison among patients. However, we
found no association between poly(GP) and repeat length in the
frontal cortex or cerebellum of 55 C9ORF72 repeat expansion carriers
(19). Furthermore, when using CSF poly(GP) as a pharmacodynamic
marker in clinical trials, each patient would serve as their own con-
trol, with poly(GP) being measured before and during treatment;
thus, differences in repeat length among patients would not affect
the use of poly(GP) in evaluating target engagement.
The findings from the present study have several important im-
plications and also highlight areas in need of additional investiga-
tion to prepare for forthcoming clinical trials. Our data suggest that
levels of extracellular and intracellular poly(GP) can be used in pre-
clinical models to screen G4C2 RNA–targeting drugs and inform
the rational selection of dose and schedule. In addition, this study
and others provide ample evidence that c9ASOs efficiently block path-
ological features associated with c9ALS/FTD in preclinical models
(12, 14–16, 22). Moreover, our data offer persuasive support that CSF
poly(GP) represents a promising pharmacodynamic marker for c9ASOs
and other therapeutic approaches, such as small molecules (17), that
target G4C2 RNA. Boding well for the use of ASOs to treat c9ALS/FTD,
intrathecal administration of ASOs against superoxide dismutase 1 was
well tolerated in a phase 1 study (29), and an ASO for spinal muscular
atrophy has been approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Admin-
istration. Overall, our identification of poly(GP) as a potential pharma-
codynamic marker will aid in the development and clinical testing of
therapeutics for patients with c9ALS, as well as patients with c9FTD
and other diseases associated with C9ORF72 repeat expansions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The goals of this study were as follows: (i) to investigate poly(GP) as a
pharmacodynamic marker using CSF from C9ORF72 mutation carriers
and noncarriers and (ii) to determine whether poly(GP) proteins are
predictive of target engagement in preclinical models of c9ALS. The
three primary analyses in our clinical studies were to replicate the de-
tection of poly(GP) in CSF from C9ORF72 mutation carriers, compare
CSF poly(GP) between asymptomatic and symptomatic carriers, and
examine the longitudinal profile of poly(GP) proteins in CSF. Ten sec-
ondary comparisons were made between CSF poly(GP) and various
clinical features, as detailed in the “Statistical analysis” section and the
Supplementary Materials. Our analyses focused on C9ORF72 mutation
carriers that were asymptomatic or clinically diagnosed with ALS with
or without comorbid FTD. However, to ensure that poly(GP) was mea-
sured in a blinded manner to genotype and disease subtype, CSF from
C9ORF72 mutation carriers with diseases other than c9ALS or c9ALS-
FTD was included, as were samples from individuals lacking the muta-
tion (Table 1). Sample size was based on availability of CSF from multiple
institutes (table S1). Written informed consent was obtained from all
participants or their legal next of kin if they were unable to give
written consent, and biological samples were obtained with ethics
committee approval. For our preclinical studies, we examined whether
c9ASO-induced decreases in G4C2 repeat–associated features were ac-
companied by decreases in extracellular and intracellular poly(GP) in
lymphoblastoid cell lines, iPSNs, and (G4C2)66-expressing mice.
Immunoassay analysis of poly(GP)
Poly(GP) in all samples was measured using a previously character-
ized Meso Scale Discovery–based immunoassay (17, 19). See the Sup-
plementary Materials for details on the preparation of all sample types
and assay conditions.
Testing the effect of c9ASOs in preclinical models
Patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines and (G4C2)66-expressing
mice were treated with c9ASO-1, which targets the G4C2 repeat sequence
(Integrated DNA Technologies) (12) and has the following properties:
(i) sequence, CCGGCCCCGGCCCCGGCCCC; (ii) modification, 5-10-
5, 2′-O-methyl RNA, phosphorothioate backbone; and (iii) function,
RNase H activation. Patient-derived iPSNs were treated with c9ASO-
2, a modified 2′-O-methoxyethyl/DNA ASO generated by Ionis Phar-
maceuticals (12, 22). The control ASO (CCTTCCCTGAAGGTTCCTCC)
was also generated by Ionis Pharmaceuticals. Details on preclinical
models, treatment conditions, and end-point evaluations are provided
in the Supplementary Materials.
Statistical analysis
For our clinical studies using CSF, continuous variables were summar-
ized with the sample median, minimum, 25th percentile, 75th percentile,
and maximum. All analyses except the examination of poly(GP) over
time used only the first measurement of poly(GP) for each patient to
satisfy the statistical assumption of independent measurements. For
the comparison of CSF poly(GP) between carriers and noncarriers
of the C9ORF72 mutation, a nonparametric approach was needed be-
cause values equal to zero in the noncarriers resulted in a skewed
distribution. Therefore, a Wilcoxon rank sum test was used in unadjusted
analysis, whereas a van Elteren stratified Wilcoxon rank sum test was
used in adjusted analysis (30), where a 12-level variable was created on
the basis of age at CSF collection (less than the median or greater than or
equal to the median), gender, and disease group (asymptomatic, ALS,
ALS-FTD, or other), and the test was stratified by this variable.
For all other comparisons of poly(GP) between various groups,
these involved C9ORF72 mutation carriers and were made using un-
adjusted and adjusted linear regression models, where poly(GP) was
considered on the logarithm scale (after adding a constant of 0.1 to all
values to avoid values of zero) because of its skewed distribution. Com-
parisons of poly(GP) between asymptomatic and ALS or ALS-FTD
C9ORF72 mutation carriers were adjusted for age at CSF collection
and gender. Comparisons of poly(GP) according to cognitive or be-
havioral impairment were adjusted for age at CSF collection, gender,
and years of education. Comparisons of poly(GP) according to other
patient characteristics [age at CSF collection, age of onset, gender, time
from onset to CSF collection, onset site, disease group, or ALSFRS-R
(a validated rating instrument for monitoring the progression of dis-
ability in ALS patients)] in c9ALS or c9ALS-FTD patients were ad-
justed for any variable associated with poly(GP) with a P value of
0.05 or lower in unadjusted analysis.
To evaluate whether poly(GP) changes over time, the slope from a
linear regression model [where poly(GP) was the response and time
after baseline poly(GP) measure was the predictor variable] was cal-
culated separately for each patient. These slopes were tested for dif-
ference from a value of zero [indicating no change in poly(GP) over
time] using a one-sample t test.
The association between poly(GP) and survival after disease onset
in c9ALS or c9ALS-FTD patients was evaluated using Cox propor-
tional hazards regression models, where an unadjusted model was
examined as well as a model adjusted for age of disease onset, gender,
and onset site (bulbar, limb, or other). Poly(GP) was again considered
on the logarithmic scale, and HRs and 95% CIs were estimated.

 The primary analyses of our clinical studies involved three different
statistical tests; to adjust for multiple testing for these primary analy-
ses, we used a Bonferroni correction, after which P values of 0.017 or
lower are considered as statistically significant. P values of 0.05 or low-
er were considered as statistically significant for all statistical tests that
involved secondary aims. All statistical tests were two-sided. Statistical
analyses for these studies were performed using SAS (version 9.2, SAS
Institute Inc.) and R statistical software (version 2.14.0, R Foundation
for Statistical Computing).
For our preclinical studies, statistical analyses were performed with
GraphPad Prism software. For the comparison of poly(GP) in PBMCs
and lymphoblastoid cell line lysates between C9ORF72 mutation carriers
and noncarriers, a Wilcoxon rank sum test was used. The effect of control
ASO versus c9ASO-1 on mRNA of C9ORF72 variants, percentage of cells

Forcomparisonofpoly(GP)inmediaorlysatesfromiPSNswithorwithout
the C9ORF72 expansion, a Wilcoxon rank sum test was used. Spearman’s
test of correlation was used to compare poly(GP) in media and lysates. A
one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test was used
to compare total C9ORF72 mRNA, repeat-containing mRNA, or poly(GP)
in lysates from three iPSN lines treated with control ASO or various doses
of c9ASO. A two-way ANOVA was used to compare poly(GP) in media
in three lines of iPSNs treated with control ASO or various doses of
c9ASO-2 over different durations of treatment. Unpaired, two-tailed t
tests were used to compare the effect of control ASO versus c9ASO-1 in
(G4C2)66 mice on repeat-containing mRNA or C9orf72 mRNA, the per-
centage of cells with RNA foci, density of c9RAN protein pathology,
poly(GA) or poly(GP) in brain lysates, or poly(GA) or poly(GP) in CSF
(Fig. 5). A one-way ANOVA was used to conduct the same analyses but

Spearman’s test of correlation was used to compare poly(GP) in the brain
or CSF with brain poly(GP), brain poly(GA), repeat-containing tran-
scripts, and percentage of foci-bearing cells in the motor cortex.
