Abstract
Background: Clinicians are inaccurate at predicting survival. The ‘Surprise Question’ (SQ) is a screening tool that
aims to identify people nearing the end of life. Potentially, its routine use could help identify patients who might
benefit from palliative care services. The objective was to assess the accuracy of the SQ by time scale, clinician, and
speciality.
Methods: Searches were completed on Medline, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, Science Citation Index, Cochrane
Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Open Grey literature (all from
inception to November 2016). Studies were included if they reported the SQ and were written in English. Quality
was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale.
Results: A total of 26 papers were included in the review, of which 22 reported a complete data set. There were
25,718 predictions of survival made in response to the SQ. The c-statistic of the SQ ranged from 0.512 to 0.822. In
the meta-analysis, the pooled accuracy level was 74.8% (95% CI 68.6–80.5). There was a negligible difference in
timescale of the SQ. Doctors appeared to be more accurate than nurses at recognising people in the last year of
life (c-statistic = 0.735 vs. 0.688), and the SQ seemed more accurate in an oncology setting 76.1% (95% CI 69.7–86.3).
Conclusions: There was a wide degree of accuracy, from poor to reasonable, reported across studies using the SQ.
Further work investigating how the SQ could be used alongside other prognostic tools to increase the
identification of people who would benefit from palliative care is warranted.

Background
In both the UK and the USA, the Surprise Question
(SQ; “Would you be surprised if this patient died within
the next × months?”) has been suggested as a trigger for
referral to specialist palliative care [1, 2].
It has been estimated that between 69% and 82% of
dying patients in the UK would benefit from palliative
care input (specialist or generalist) [3]. There were ap-
proximately 160,000–170,000 referrals made to specialist
palliative care services in the UK between 2008 and
2009 [4]. In the USA, it has been estimated that between
1 million and 1.8 million (7.5% and 8.0%) of hospital ad-
missions have a palliative care need [5].
It has been repeatedly shown that clinicians are in-
accurate at prognostication [6–8] and in recognising
dying patients [9]. Therefore, there is an increased likeli-
hood that patients who would benefit from palliative
care are potentially being missed because validated prog-
nostic tools (e.g. Palliative Prognostic Score [10] or
Palliative Prognostic Indicator [11]) are not being used
routinely, either due to their perceived complexity or
inconvenience [12].
The SQ offers an alternative to a standard prognostic
estimate. It does not require clinicians to collect clinical
data or to use a scoring algorithm, nor does it require
clinicians to make a specific estimate about length of

 survival; it simply asks whether the respondent would be
surprised if the patient were to die within a specified
time period (usually the next year). It was originally de-
veloped by Joanne Lynn as a method to identify patients
who might benefit from palliative care services [13], ask-
ing the clinician: “Is this person sick enough that it
would be no surprise for the person to die within the
next 6 months, or a year?” Since its development, the
SQ, or variants thereof, have been incorporated into
clinical guidelines such as National Institute for Health
and Care Excellence (NICE) for End of Life Care [14],
and adopted into routine clinical practice in various set-
tings, including hospitals, hospices, and General Prac-
tices. Although developed as a standalone item, it is now
included as part of the Gold Standard Framework (GSF)
proactive identification guidance tool in the UK [1], in
which clinicians are encouraged to ask themselves
“Would you be surprised if this patient were to die in
the next 6–12 months”. A response of “No” to the SQ
may trigger a referral to specialist palliative care services,
or to the adoption of a palliative care approach to future
care. This parsimonious approach could potentially iden-
tify more patients who need palliative care and could be
incorporated into routine clinical practice with relative
ease and at little or no extra cost.
Yet, how accurate or effective is the SQ at identifying
people in the last year of life? Could it be used to iden-
tify people who are just days from dying? Is one clinical
group more accurate at using the SQ than another? Is
the SQ more accurate when used by one professional
group rather than another? The present study aims to
assess the accuracy of the SQ by time scale, clinician,
and speciality.
Methods
Data sources and searches
We initially searched the literature using the terms, “sur-
prise question” and “death”. Medline, Embase, CINAHL,
AMED, Science Citation Index, Cochrane Database of
Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Central Register of
Controlled Trials databases were searched. All databases
were searched from inception up to the date of the
search (November 2016), including papers still being
processed by the databases (for exact search terms, see
Table 1). In addition, the references of all included stud-
ies were checked and authors of papers were contacted
to check for any additional papers and for full papers if
only an abstract was identified. After contacting the au-
thors of identified papers, it was discovered that our ori-
ginal search strategy had failed to identify one key paper
[15]; therefore, the search terms were amended to in-
clude “GSF” as a keyword. The search strategy was then
re-run on all databases.
Study selection
All study designs were included.
Inclusion
� Studies conducted in human subjects
� Studies reporting the use of the SQ
Exclusion
� Studies which did not quantify the accuracy of the
SQ (or for which this information was not available
from study authors)
� Studies that collected data retrospectively
� Not reported in English
Originally, it was planned to exclude all studies that
were in abstract form. However, due to the low number
of studies initially identified, and the relative low risk as-
sociated with including such data, we opted to be inclu-
sive of all studies. We contacted all authors of abstracts
to obtain a full study report. If a full study was not

 available, abstracts from which relevant data could be
extracted were included.
Quality assessment
The quality of studies was assessed with the Newcastle–
Ottawa Scale [16]. This scale was selected due to the na-
ture of the studies included (non-randomised controlled
trial, observational). The raters met and discussed each
domain of the scale, completed one study using the
scale, and discussed any discrepancies or difficulties that
were identified before completing the assessment on all
studies. In order to provide a full account of the accur-
acy of the SQ, no study was excluded based on the risk
of bias score alone; however, if possible, it was planned
to undertake a sensitivity analysis to account for the ef-
fect of poor quality studies. Each paper was assessed by
two individual raters (NW and NK). Any discrepancies
were resolved by a meeting of the two reviewers, with a
third reviewer (PS) being included if the discrepancy was
unresolved.
Selection
The studies identified from the database searches were
screened by two reviewers independently (NW and NK).
The first selection criterion was that the abstract/title in-
cluded the use of the SQ. Any study not meeting this
criterion was excluded. At full review, studies were se-
lected for inclusion if they reported a quantifiable meas-
ure of the accuracy of the SQ (e.g. the proportion of
patients correctly identified as being in the last year of
life, as opposed to a qualitative assessment such as “the
SQ performed well”). Any discrepancies at either selec-
tion point were resolved by a meeting between the two
reviewers. If unresolved, a third reviewer (PS) was
consulted.
Extraction
The following data were extracted from each paper:
� A description of the study population (both patient
and clinician)
� The format of the SQ that was used in the study
(e.g. the length of time to which the SQ related, or
whether the SQ referred to expected survival or
expected death)
� The accuracy of the SQ (i.e. how many people who
were identified as likely to die, did actually die)
Data synthesis and analysis
A narrative synthesis of the findings from the studies
was completed. This included details about the patient
population characteristics, clinician characteristics, the
format of the SQ, and the outcome (accuracy of SQ).
A quantitative synthesis was completed from those
studies where data were available. All authors were con-
tacted if the published data were incomplete or where
calculation errors were noted in the published manu-
script. Stata v13.0 was used for all analyses.
The accuracy of the SQ was summarised in a 2 × 2
table for each study. The sensitivity (the ability to recog-
nise those who were dying), specificity (the ability to rec-
ognise those who were not dying), positive predictive
value (PPV, the proportion of patients who died when
the clinician predicted dying), and the negative predict-
ive value (NPV, the proportion of patients who survived
when the clinician predicted survival) were calculated
[17]. The area under the curve (AUROC), also known as
the c-statistic value, was calculated. This statistic com-
pares the number of correct estimates (sensitivity)
against the number of false estimates (1-specificity). A
score of 0.5 indicates a model with poor predictive value,
meaning that clinicians are no better than chance at
identifying a person nearing the end of their life. An in-
crease in the value (to a maximum score of 1) indicates
an increase in the level of clinician accuracy.
The accuracy overall, by timeframe, by profession, and
by speciality, was calculated by meta-analysis, using the
“metaprop” command in Stata. These data were used to
assess heterogeneity of the data synthesis using the I2
statistic. Where possible, a sub-analysis of accuracy by
clinician profession, patient group, and clinical setting
were completed. To account for the 0% and 100% limits,
the data obtained were transformed using the Freeman
Tukey double arcsine method, and a meta-analysis was
completed using the DerSimonian–Laird method with
inverse variance weighting and then back transformed to
present the percentage accuracy. We examined the im-
pact of the time-frame of the SQ on its diagnostic accur-
acy. For this analysis, the time frame was categorised
into up to 30 days, up to 6 months, and up to
12 months.
Publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot
(Additional file 1: Figure S1).
Role of the funding source
This review was completed as part of a PhD studentship
awarded from University College London. The funders
had no role in this systematic review.
Results
In total, 357 studies were identified from the database
searches (Fig. 1). No studies were identified through the
grey literature search. Of those studies initially identified,
182 were subsequently found to be duplicates. There
were 175 studies that were screened by title and abstract,
of which 118 were excluded. Of the 57 full text articles
retrieved,
34
were
excluded
for
various
reasons

 (Additional file 2: Table S1). Three additional studies
were identified from a search of the references of the in-
cluded studies. In total, 26 papers were included in this
review [15, 18–42].
We were able to obtain data from one unpublished
paper with which we replaced one of the abstracts [33].
Another abstract [41] was excluded because the full
paper had also been published [43].
Each paper included underwent a quality assessment
with high agreement between the two raters (ICC 0.93)
(Additional file 3: Table S2). No paper was excluded on
the basis of their quality score.
A summary of the studies included can be seen in
Table 2. Of the 26 papers, ten (38%) were from the UK
and nine (35%) were from the USA. Ten (38%) of the
studies were presented in abstract form, the rest were
full papers. Eight of the included studies related to pa-
tients with end-stage renal disease, six related to cancer
patients, four related to patients with heart failure, one
study related to patients with sepsis, one study related to
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and six studies
included patients with a variety of different diagnoses.
The majority of studies (15, 58%) specified 12 months as
the relevant period for the SQ. Eight papers specified a
time frame of 6 to 12 months. Three papers specified
shorter time periods.
We were able to extract data from 22/26 papers either
directly from the paper or after contacting the author
(Table 3).
Accuracy of the SQ
The outcomes of 25,718 estimates were reported in the
22 studies with complete data. Patients died within the
specified timeframe (whatever it was in that particular
study) on 4217 occasions (16%). A response of “No, I
would not be surprised” was given on 6495 occasions

 (25%) and clinicians’ intuitions were ‘correct’ (about
whether they should or should not be surprised) in
20,964/25,718 cases (82%). Most of the correct attribu-
tions occurred when clinicians indicated that they would
be surprised if the patient died within the specified time
period (19,223 occasions) and they did in fact survive for
that length of time (17,985 occasions).
The results across the studies (Table 3) showed a wide
variation in the reported accuracy of the SQ. The sensi-
tivity ranged between 11.6% and 95.6% and a range of
13.8% to 98.2% was reported for specificity. The PPV
ranged from 13.9% to 78.6%, and the NPV ranged from
61.3% to 99%. The AUROC score (c-statistic) across the
studies ranged from 0.512 to 0.822.
There was no indication of publication bias from the
funnel plot (Additional file 1: Figure S1).
On meta-analysis, the pooled level of accuracy, that is
the number of times the clinician correctly predicted the
outcome of a patient, was 74.8% (95% CI 68.6–80.5; I2 =
99.1%, 95% CI 99–99). The studies were sorted by date
of publication and there appeared to be no trend by year
(Fig. 2). After a sensitivity analysis for lower quality rated
scores, in which eight papers were removed [19, 31, 32,
34, 35, 41, 42, 44], the pooled accuracy level increased to
75.4% (95% CI 70.8–79.7; I2 = 96.8, 95% CI 96–98).
Those studies that used a shorter time frame for the SQ
(up to 6 months) had a pooled estimate of 76.6% (95%
CI 61.6–88.8%; I2 99.6%, 95% CI 100–100), and when
the time frame was reduced to imminent death (i.e.
7 days, 30 days or ‘this admission’) the pooled accuracy
estimate was 76.4% (95% CI 52.4–93.8; I2 99.8%, 95% CI
100–100) (Fig. 3). The meta-regression indicated that the
increase in time frame did not impact on the diagnostic ac-
curacy of the SQ: comparing up to 30 days with 12 months
(difference in accuracy = 0.8%, 95% CI –12.8 to 14.5, P =
0.901) and comparing up to 6 months with 12 months (dif-
ference = 4.3%, 95% CI –10.8 to 19.4, P = 0.561).
One unpublished paper [33] reported the results of the
SQ and a modified version of the SQ, by asking clini-
cians “would you be surprised if this person was to be
alive in a year’s time?” By rewording the question, they
found that specificity was improved (i.e. correctly identi-
fying those who do not die) but sensitivity was reduced
(i.e. less correct predictions about those who will die).
The SQ by profession and by specialty
One paper reported the difference in performance of the
SQ when used by nurses and doctors [40]. As a result of
additional data supplied by the author, it was possible to
calculate the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for
both doctors and nurses (Table 4).
Doctors appeared to be better at predicting dying
within 12 months, with a sensitivity of 73% (95% CI 63–
82) and specificity of 74% (95% CI 70–78) compared to
a sensitivity of 45% (95% CI 40–49) and specificity of
82% (96% CI 80–83) for nurses. The c-statistic for doc-
tors was 0.735 (95% CI 0.688–0.783) compared to 0.632
(95% CI 0.608–0.655) for nurses.
Of the 22 papers that included data, eight reported
research conducted within a haemodialysis context
[18–21, 27, 29, 31, 40], five were within oncology
[22, 23, 25, 26, 34], and nine papers were on other
areas (five on all diagnoses [28, 33, 35, 41, 44], one
on sepsis [42], two on heart disease [15, 30], and one
on COPD [32]). Table 5 highlights the range of
scores from the individual studies reporting from
each specialty.
On meta-analysis, the pooled accuracy for oncology
was 78.6% (95% CI 69.7–86.3; I2 = 99.0%, 95% CI 99–99).
The pooled accuracy for renal was 76.1% (95% CI 73.9–
78.3%; I2 = 36.0%, 95% CI 0–72). The pooled accuracy
estimate for the other group was 72.3% (95% CI 58.0–
84.6; I2 = 99.1%, 95% CI 99–99) (Fig. 4).
Studies with incomplete data
Four studies had insufficient data to be included in
the meta-analysis. Three authors responded to re-
quests, but were unable to provide additional data to
that presented in the paper [37, 39]. One author was
not contactable [38].
One study [37] did not report data on the accuracy of
a ‘Yes’ response to the SQ. In this study, it was reported
that specialist heart failure nurses would not be sur-
prised
if
88/126
patients
would
have

within
12 months. In fact, 78/88 (89%) of those patients did die

 within 12 months. However, no data were reported
about the outcomes for the 38 patients where the heart
failure nurses would have been surprised if the patient
had died. One study only contained data relating to the
responses from the clinicians but not the outcome [36].
Gardiner et al. (2013) described the responses from doc-
tors and nurses for two survival time points: 12 months
and “death during this admission”. Of 297 patients,
doctors would not have been surprised if 123 had died
within 12 months, or if 50 had died during the admis-
sion to hospital. Out of a total of 473 patients, nurses
predicted that 180 would die within the next 12 months,
and 74 would die during the admission. The actual sur-
vival figures were not reported [36]. Lilley et al. [39] re-
ported on the accuracy of 28 clinicians who provided
responses for 163 patients. Their results show a ‘No’ SQ

 response was given in 93 cases (60%). They reported a
sensitivity of 81% (95% CI 71–91%), a specificity of 51%
(41–61%), a PPV of 52% (42–61%), and a NPV of 82%
(72–91%). The exact breakdown of outcome by SQ pre-
diction was not presented [39]. Lefkowits et al. [38] re-
port the accuracy of the SQ within gynaecological
oncology and across physicians. They asked 22 clinicians
(18 gynaecologic oncology physicians and advanced
practice providers (APP); four chemotherapy nurses) the
SQ with a timeframe of 12 months. They reported the
unadjusted odds ratio for death within a year associated
with a ‘No’ SQ response; physicians 5.6 (P < 0.001), APP
9.2 (P < 0.001) and nurse 6.9 (P < 0.001). They reported
that the APP group had the highest sensitivity (79.5%)
and the nurses had the best specificity (75.6%). No fur-
ther data was presented [38].
Discussion
The reported accuracy of the SQ varied considerably be-
tween studies. The c-statistic ranged from 0.512 (poor)
to 0.822 (good). The PPV ranged from 13.9% to 78.6%.
This degree of heterogeneity was not uncommon in
studies assessing the accuracy of clinicians’ prognostic
estimates [6].
On meta-analysis, the overall accuracy of the SQ was
approximately
75%.
However,
this
overall
estimate
should be reviewed with caution given the low propor-
tion of people who died within each study (16%) and the
low number of high quality studies included (I2 = 99%).
There was virtually no difference in level of accuracy
when considering studies in which the timeframe of the
SQ had been reduced, which suggests that even when
the patient is thought to be imminently dying, there is
only moderate accuracy and continued uncertainty. A
major limitation of the meta-regression analysis com-
pleted in this review was the lack of power due to the
small sample size (n = 24). Therefore, a significant differ-
ence between time frames of the SQ was less likely to be
observed.
One study presented data about the differences in ac-
curacy between different professional groups at using
the SQ. This suggested that doctors’ responses to the SQ
(c-statistic 0.735) may be more accurate than nurses’ (c-
statistic 0.632); however, more research is needed to fully
address this question.
The variation in the accuracy of the SQ might be due
as much to variations in disease trajectory in the last
year of life as it is due to variations in the prognostic
ability of the clinicians. There is some evidence that the
SQ may be slightly better when used in oncology pa-
tients rather than in renal or other disease groups. The
pooled accuracy for oncology was 79% compared to 76%
for renal and 72% for other disease groups. This sup-
ports the idea that patients with a cancer diagnosis have
a more predictable disease trajectory [45]. However,
there was little variation between the disease groups and
so these data should be interpreted cautiously. Another
recent review on the SQ (using different inclusion and
exclusion criteria to our own) [46] also found that accur-
acy was slightly better in oncology patients than in other
disease groups.
When proposing the original definition of the SQ,
Lynn suggested that the accuracy of the outcome was
not actually that relevant as all patients identified by this
question would typically need the services of palliative
care such as advance care planning, home care assist-
ance or financial support [13]. However, it is often the
case that clinicians delay referring to palliative care ser-
vices because they feel that the judgment should be
made on the basis of a reasonably accurate and relatively
short prognosis. This review highlights that, intuitively,
clinicians are actually quite good at excluding patients
with longer survival times but that use of the SQ alone
is likely to lead to identification of a substantial number
of patients who are not necessarily approaching the ends
of their lives. However, the review could not provide evi-
dence about how many patients who were identified (or
missed) by the SQ actually had palliative care needs.
What is apparent from the data presented is that using
the SQ to identify patients with a limited prognosis will
detect at least as many ‘false positives’ as ‘true positives’.
In most circumstances, the consequences of misclassifica-
tion by the SQ are rarely likely to be clinically important.
For instance, erroneously including patients on a palliative
care register who are not actually in the last year of life is
unlikely to adversely affect their care, and indeed may re-
sult in better provision of holistic care. However, the rec-
ognition that half of patients included on such registers,
as a result of the SQ, may not actually be in the last year
of life has resource implications (e.g. additional staff time,
care planning and multi-disciplinary involvement). It is
thus not clear whether the SQ is a cost-effective way of
identifying patients potentially suitable for palliative care.
A careful balance is needed between identifying more
people with unmet palliative care needs in a timely way
while not over-burdening limited resources with too many
patients in need of good care for long-term conditions
over a much longer period.
It should be acknowledged that the SQ is usually used
as part of a wider prognostic assessment that includes
both general measures of performance status and disease
burden along with disease-specific indicators [1, 2]. It is
possible that the combination of the SQ with these other
prognostic measures may well be more accurate than
the SQ used in isolation. This, however, was not the
focus of this systematic review and further work is
needed in order to evaluate the accuracy of these ap-
proaches and to determine whether other prognostic
White et al. BMC Medicine  (2017) 15:139 
Page 12 of 14
 tools (e.g. Prognosis in Palliative Care Study [47], Pallia-
tive Prognostic Score [10] or Palliative Performance
Scale [48]) would be a more accurate way of identifying
patients approaching the end of life, or whether accuracy
could be further improved by using the SQ alongside
other tools such as the Palliative Outcome Scale, which
can identify and document changes in the patient’s con-
dition over time [49].
Our study had a number of strengths. This was the
first systematic review of the SQ that has attempted a
meta-analysis of all studies reporting data on the SQ, in-
cluding shorter time scales such as 7 days. We adopted a
broad search strategy to identify any potentially relevant
papers. We also obtained missing data by contacting
relevant authors and requesting unpublished results. We
have also appraised the quality of the papers included in
our study and have conducted a sensitivity analysis to
determine whether our conclusions are robust. Finally,
each stage of the review process was undertaken by two
independent reviewers to ensure rigor.
Our study had a number of limitations. It was difficult
to devise a search strategy to capture all of the relevant
papers. There is no agreed methodology for conducting
a search of the literature for this type of research ques-
tion. It is therefore possible that some papers may have
been missed. In order to perform a meta-analysis of
data, we combined studies that had evaluated the accur-
acy of the SQ over different time-frames, in widely dif-
fering patient groups and with different groups of
clinicians. It may be argued that this is not a legitimate
approach in terms of clinical heterogeneity as the per-
formance of the SQ may be very different in each of
these different circumstances. Further work is clearly
needed to investigate any such differences (particularly
our preliminary finding that a doctor’s estimates may be
more informative than nurses’ estimates).
Conclusion
This review has highlighted the wide degree of accuracy
reported for the SQ as a prognostic tool. Further work is
required to understand the processes by which clinicians
arrive at their prognostic estimates, to refine the accur-
acy of the SQ and to compare its performance against
other more sophisticated prognostic tools, particularly in
populations where a higher proportion of deaths occur.
