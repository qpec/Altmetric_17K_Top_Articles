Review of Infectious Etiology of Acute Pancreatitis

Abstract
While gallstones and alcoholism are widely known to be the most 
common causative agents of acute pancreatitis, about 10% of cases 
are thought to be caused by infectious microorganisms. These micro-
organisms include viruses (e.g. mumps, Coxsackie B, and hepatitis), 
bacteria (e.g. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and leptospirosis), and para-
sites (e.g. Ascaris lumbricoides, Fasciola hepatica, and hydatid dis-
ease). Each organism causes acute pancreatitis through diverse mech-
anisms. The review is primarily conducted in an attempt to provide a 
better understanding of the possibility of acute pancreatitis presenting 
as a complication relating to these organisms, and the aim is to guide 
future diagnoses, management, and predictions of complications.
Keywords: Infectious causes; Acute pancreatitis
Introduction
Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an inflammatory disease affecting 
the exocrine part of pancreatic parenchyma. It may range from 
a mild self-limiting form (acute interstitial pancreatitis) up to 
a more severe and rapidly fatal form (acute necrotizing pan-
creatitis). It may also extend beyond pancreatic tissue to the 
peripancreatic region and is usually associated with a systemic 
inflammatory response, which, if not treated properly, may end 
up in multi-organ failure [1].
Although life-threatening, AP is a reversible process of 
interstitial edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, as well as 
cellular apoptosis, necrosis, and hemorrhage. It mainly causes 
exocrine dysfunction; however, the repetitive process of in-
flammation and subsequent fibrosis can cause both exocrine 
and endocrine dysfunction [2].
Etiology of AP
Gallstones and alcoholism are two most common etiological 
factors of AP. Cholelithiasis is reported in 40-70% of cases 
while alcoholism is seen in 25-35% [3]. Other rare causes of 
AP include drugs such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, and 
DDI; however, these only account for 1-4% of cases, and further 
evidence is required to demonstrate their correlation to this con-
dition [4]. In hypertriglyceridemia, serum triglycerides should 
rise above 1,000 mg/dL to be considered as a possible cause of 
AP. Benign or malignant strictures of the pancreatic duct are as-
sociated with AP in about 5-14% patients [5]. In a recent study 
on the different etiological factors of AP, 1,914 patients were 
considered for the causes of their AP, and this study revealed 
cholelithiasis to be the primary etiology, identified in 58.7% of 
cases. The second most common cause was idiopathic AP, iden-
tified in 543 patients (16.7%), followed by hyperlipidemia in 
467 patients (14.3%) and alcohol in 148 patients (4.5%) [6].
Nevertheless, about 10% of AP cases are caused by other 
miscellaneous factors such as infection by parasites, bacteria, 
and viruses [7].
Infectious Etiology of AP
Various infectious microorganisms may cause infectious pan-
creatitis, and these include viruses (hepatotropic virus, Cox-
sackie virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), human immunode-
ficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), mumps, 
varicella-zoster virus, and other viruses); bacteria (mycoplas-
ma, legionella, salmonella, and leptospira); fungi (aspergillus); 
and parasites (toxoplasmosis, cryptosporidium, and ascaris) [8].
Precise investigations, however, should be performed to 
exclude other causes of AP and correlate the infectious agent 
to the disease so as to avoid false diagnoses and, subsequently, 
improper disease management as such instances can go as high 
as 10% of all AP cases [9].
Viral Causes of AP
The largest number of infectious pancreatitis incidents are caused 
by viruses including hepatotropic virus, Coxsackie virus, CMV, 
HIV, HSV, mumps, varicella-zoster virus, and other viruses.
Among all types of hepatitis viruses, hepatitis B virus is 
the one most commonly known to be associated with AP, typi-
cally occurring in post-transplantation patients. Immunosup-

pressive therapy in post-transplant patients may play a role in 
the development of AP [10]. In a study including 27 HBsAg 
carriers who underwent liver transplantation, four suffered AP 
post-transplantation [11]. The diagnosis is based on detecting 
HBsAg in pancreatic acinar cells and pancreatic juice [12]. 
Some studies have reported AP occurring due to hepatitis A 
virus and hepatitis E virus [13-16].
Coxsackie virus type B virus is a single-stranded RNA 
picornavirus with six serotypes identified (serotypes 1-6). It 
typically causes self-limiting conditions involving the gastro-
intestinal and respiratory systems. Several retrospective and 
prospective studies in the literature have demonstrated the 
role of Coxsackie B virus in AP, where patients manifested 
symptoms of AP, and the virus was identified by immunohis-
tochemistry methods and serologic tests (antibodies against 
viral antigens) [6]. Recently, different serotypes of Coxsackie 
virus B4, such as CB4-P and CB4-V, have been found to cause 
both acute and chronic pancreatitis, possibly due to different 
immune-mediated mechanisms [17].
CMV-associated pancreatitis is rare. In 2014, a case re-
port by Chan et al describes an otherwise healthy individual 
with a history of acute viral prodrome who, then, developed 
hepatitis and pancreatitis. CMV infection was confirmed by 
a positive polymerase chain reaction, and the patient was put 
on ganciclovir, which caused clinical and laboratory recovery 
[18]. Salazar-Huayna et al also discussed two case reports of 
patients with AP who tested positive for CMV in reverse tran-
scriptase PCR; both individuals were known HIV patients. As 
the case describes, the patients were prescribed ganciclovir, 
and they improved, both clinically and as indicated by labora-
tory findings [19].
Another case report by Baran et al reviews AP in a case of 
H1N1 viral infection and the case initiated a need for further 
studies to identify the relationship between influenza and AP 
[20].
In HIV infection, AP is a well-known complication. Its 
incidence rises to 40% among HIV-positive patients as com-
pared to 2% in the general population [21]. It may be caused 
either by the direct effect of the virus on pancreatic tissue or, 
most commonly, by anti-retroviral drug regimens (HAART) 
such as a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or protease 
inhibitors, which induce hypertriglyceridemia that, subse-
quently, causes AP [22].
There have been sporadic reports of HSV causing AP [23]. 
One particular case report was disseminated HSV causing AP. 
Notably, the HSV DNA was detected in the pancreas by using 
in situ hybridization [24].
The first reported case in the literature that identifies 
mumps as a causative organism for AP occurred in 1905 when 
Lemoine described a patient with an illness consistent with 
mumps and manifestations consistent with AP [8]. Mumps vi-
rus is a single-stranded DNA paramyxovirus that causes paro-
titis and orchitis in school-aged children and adolescents; it 
sometimes is complicated by meningoencephalitis and pancre-
atitis. When complicated by the latter, it manifests in abdomi-
nal pain and diarrhea, and the condition is usually self-limiting 
[6]. The incidence rate of mumps among patients of AP was 
found to be about 5.1% of patients hospitalized for mumps in 
the US [25]. It is worth noting that, following the use of the 
MMR vaccine, just a single case of mumps virus-associated 
AP has been described in the literature [26].
Varicella-zoster virus might be a probable cause of AP in 
children as it has been implicated in causing pancreatic pseu-
docyst and duodenal obstruction [27].
Other viruses that might cause AP include Epstein-Barr 
virus, rubella, and rubeola, but there is not yet sufficient evi-
dence to link them directly to AP as causative agents [8].
Bacterial Causes of AP
Many studies in the extant literature have reported the asso-
ciation between bacterial pathogens and AP. In the mid-70s, 
Freeman first described the association between Mycoplasma 
pneumonia and AP in nine out of 27 patients (33%), and the di-
agnosis was confirmed by serological tests [28]. Although this 
association between Mycoplasma pneumonia and AP has been 
further enriched by Leinikki et al and McMahon, no evidence 
of infection in pancreatic cells by the organism was identi-
fied, drawing the organism as a potential etiology into ques-
tion [6]. A more recent case report and review of the literature 
by Lacasa et al in March 2017 provided evidence for patients 
with AP who had a history of upper respiratory tract infec-
tion and positive serum serology for Mycoplasma pneumonia 
[29]. In his report, Lacasa depended on the rule by Parenti et al 
[8], formulated in his intensive review about infectious causes 
of AP, where Parenti states that serological tests alone are not 
enough and that patients must show characteristic symptoms 
of the causative organism to avoid false association with AP.
Only a few cases reported in the literature describe the as-
sociation between leptospirosis and AP. Leptospirosis is com-
monly known as “yellow fever”. Possible complications due to 
leptospirosis include acute renal failure (95% of cases), acute 
hepatic failure (72% of cases), acute respiratory failure (38% 
of cases), acute cardiovascular failure (33% of cases) and AP 
(25%) [30]. A recent report of two cases by Kaya described 
AP in a patient with confirmed leptospirosis. However, for the 
diagnosis of AP in such a case, at least a four-fold increase in 
serum amylase and lipase is necessary to confirm AP as hy-
peramylasemia is exceedingly common in leptospirosis caused 
by factors other than AP (i.e. renal failure, reticuloendothelial 
system dysfunction). So, correlation with a four-fold serum 
amylase level elevation, as well as a CECT scan, was neces-
sary to support the diagnosis of AP with leptospirosis [31].
Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection rarely causes AP 
[32]; however, a diagnosis can be made using biopsy or fine-
needle aspiration followed by tissue culture or PCR to detect 
the microorganism in the pancreatic tissue [6].
Severe gastroenteritis and typhoid-like symptoms are the 
most common manifestations of Paratyphoid salmonellosis, 
but a causative relationship between the organism and AP is 
rarely reported in current literature. One case report that de-
scribed a connection between Salmonella paratyphi and AP, 
and the presence of meningitis, was reported by Makhoul et al 
in 2015, though the authors did not mention how they verified 
the correlation among these conditions or whether or not the

organism was extracted from pancreatic tissue [33]. A prospec-
tive study carried out by Pezzilli et al in 2003 stated that, in 30 
patients, hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia were reported 
in 6.7% and 16.7% of cases, respectively, without any clinical 
symptoms or signs suggestive of AP, which suggests a low risk 
of AP in Salmonella infections [34].
Sporadic cases of AP due to gastrointestinal bacteria like 
Campylobacter jejuni [35, 36], Yersinia enterocolitica [37, 
38], Yersinia pseudotuberculosis [38], Brucella [39], and No-
cardia [40] have been reported in the literature [6].
Parasitic Causes of AP
Ascaris lumbricoides is the most common parasite implicated 
in AP as mentioned by Parenti et al in their extensive review. 
The mechanism of pancreatitis involved in the adult worm’s 
obstruction of the pancreatic duct is shown in ultrasounds, sur-
gery, endoscopy, or postmortem autopsies. As well, it is more 
common in children due to the smaller size of their pancreat-
ic-biliary tree [8]. In a prospective study carried out in India, 
ascariasis was the leading cause of pancreatitis in 59 of 256 
patients (23%) compared to 112 patients (44%) with gallstone 
pancreatitis [41].
The Chinese liver fluke, Clonorchis sinensis, was reported 
in some cases of AP due to the obstruction of the pancreatic 
duct [42].
Plasmodium falciparum is one of the most common pro-
tozoa, and it is known to cause malaria. In one 2016 case, a 
patient with malaria complicated by multi-organ affection was 
found to have AP as well. The diagnosis of Plasmodium malaria 
was made by a peripheral blood smear and a positive Paracheck 
rapid antigen test for Plasmodium falciparum. On ultrasound, 
the pancreas was found to be hypoechoic and bulky, and it was 
treated using anti-malarial agents that proved AP to be an atypi-
cal complication for malaria. Thus, it should be ruled out in 
patients presenting with AP with an unknown etiology [43].
Although infrequently associated with AP, taeniasis was 
also reported as one of the possible helminths that cause AP in 
a case published in 2005. In this instance, the patient presented 
with typical symptoms for AP and markedly elevated serum 
amylase and lipase, including a history of the passage of white 
worms with the stool for 4 years. The proglottids were ex-
tracted from the duodenal mucosa with ultrasound findings of 
dilated common bile duct and pancreatic duct, which provides 
possible evidence of a tapeworm passing through the biliary 
tree. The patient responded to anti-helminthic drugs, and the 
condition improved [44].
Other parasites implicated in AP include Opisthorchis spe-
cies [45], Fasciola hepatica [46, 47], and Echinococcus granu-
lous [48], which may cause AP due to the compression of the 
pancreatic duct by the cyst [8].
Fungal Causes of AP
Despite the fact of lack of clear evidence in the literature, fungi 
have been at times implicated as causative agents for AP. In 
one case, fungus infection (aspergillus) was found to develop 
into AP, and a postmortem autopsy revealed the fungus invad-
ing pancreatic tissue causing infarction, necrosis, and inflam-
mation [49].
A recent case-control study in 2007 reviewed patients with 
AP between 2003 and 2005 who tested positive for candida or 
gave signs of possible candida infection (candida in their fluids 
without evidence of candida in pancreatic necrotic tissue). The 
first group comprised about 21% of the participants while the 
second one comprised 19%. Most commonly, candida com-
plicates acute necrotizing pancreatitis rather than causes it. 
Moreover, candida is also often responsible for a longer hospi-
tal stay and increased mortality rates [50].
Pathogenesis of AP Caused by Infectious Mi-
croorganisms
AP may manifest as a mild interstitial form, which constitutes 
80% of cases and has a low morbidity and mortality rate (< 
1%); however, about 20% of patients with AP develop the 
more severe form (necrotizing pancreatitis). This form has an 
early vasoactive and toxic phase, and a late, more severe septic 
phase [51].
Many theories have been postulated to give us a better un-
derstanding of and describe the mechanism by which AP takes 
place. These theories include bile-pancreatic duct common 
pathway theory, pancreatic autodigestion theory, gallstone mi-
gration theory, enzyme activation theory, kinin and comple-
ment system activation theory, microcirculation disturbance 
theory, leukocyte excessive activation theory, and pancreatic 
acinar cell apoptosis and necrosis theory, all of which are still 
currently under review [52].
Considering that infectious agents are responsible for 
about 10% of AP cases, the mechanism by which they cause 
AP is not so different from the ones previously mentioned. 
Each organism works in its peculiar way to cause AP.
Many theories have been created to explain viral pancrea-
titis, and one of these is the direct destruction of pancreatic 
acinar cells by inflammation and edema, a theory supported by 
autopsy findings that revealed HBV antigens in the cytoplasm 
of affected pancreatic acinar cells. There is the possibility of a 
causative relationship between the amount of affected pancre-
atic acinar cells and the severity of the disease. Another theory 
suggests that the damaging of pancreatic acinar cells by the 
virus leads to a leaking intracellular enzyme or precipitates a 
process of cell death similar to that occurring in hepatocytes 
affected in acute hepatitis [12]. Alternatively, another way of 
damaging pancreatic cells is by edema of the ampulla of Vater 
with obstruction to the outflow of pancreatic fluid [13].
Other mechanisms explain AP caused by Mycoplasma 
pneumonia. One proposed mechanism is the production of cy-
tokines triggered by bacterial lipoproteins, and another is the 
inflammatory response in different organs caused by the bacte-
rial pathogen’s immune modulation. A third mechanism is the 
vascular occlusion mechanism in which both direct and indi-
rect types are possible. The direct type is caused by bacteria in 
the blood stream triggering the release of local inflammatory

mediators, while the indirect one is the result of a systemic 
hypercoagulable state. The real pathological mechanism, how-
ever, is unknown [29].
Leptospirosis causes vasculitis and endothelial damage, 
and it most commonly affects the liver and kidneys though 
other tissues can be affected as well, such as the pancreas due 
to pancreatitis [31].
Parasites such as Ascaris lumbricoides cause AP from the 
adult worm obstructing either the pancreatic duct or the com-
mon bile duct as demonstrated by surgery, endoscopy, and 
autopsy findings. Alternatively, it may be caused by abscess 
formation if it has progressed to more distal parts of the pan-
creas [53]. While hydatid cysts do not cause pancreaticobiliary 
obstruction, the formation of cysts within the pancreas com-
presses the pancreatic duct, though such obstruction may also 
be caused by direct rupture of a hepatic hydatid cyst into the 
biliary tree, causing AP [8].
Conclusion and Future Perspectives
The current literature provides information about the types of 
organisms thought to be involved in causing AP as they are 
purported to coexist in patients with a concurrent clinical case 
of AP; however, much evidence is still lacking to determine 
them to be causative agents of AP. If such a correlation is prov-
en to be true with enough evidence, then this will reflect on the 
different aspects of diagnosing and managing infectious causes 
of AP. Thus far, evidence in the literature is limited to multiple 
case reports and retrospective studies. Advanced diagnostic 
techniques like a biopsy or fine needle aspiration, along with 
tissue culture, PCR, or in situ hybridization, are required to 
give us a better understanding of the role played by infectious 
agents in causing AP. Whether treating the infectious process 
will lead to improved outcomes requires further investigation.
