Summary
Temporary and permanent tracheostomies are required in children to manage actual or anticipated
long-term ventilatory support, to aid secretion management or to manage fixed upper airway obstruction.
Tracheostomies may be required from the first few moments of life, with the majority performed in children
< 4 years of age. Although similarities with adult tracheostomies are apparent, there are key differences
when managing the routine and emergency care of children with tracheostomies. The National Tracheost-
omy Safety Project identified the need for structured guidelines to aid multidisciplinary clinical decision
making during paediatric tracheostomy emergencies. These guidelines describe the development of a
bespoke emergency management algorithm and supporting resources. Our aim is to reduce the
frequency, nature and severity of paediatric tracheostomy emergencies through preparation and education
of staff, parents, carers and patients.

 Recommendations
1.
Bedhead signs communicate essential airway details
and should be mandated as part of the theatre sign--
out process following tracheostomy surgery
2.
The best available assistance should be summoned
early to an emergency and institutions should plan
for this in advance
3.
Essential airway equipment must be immediately
available and accompany the patient
4.
High- and low-fidelity simulation has an important role
to play for healthcare staff, families and carers, using
the algorithm as a checklist to guide responders
5.
Healthcare professionals who look after children with
tracheostomies should receive regular training in
routine and emergency tracheostomy management
Introduction
The
indications
for
tracheostomy
in
children
have
evolved
over
the
years,
which
have
influenced
the
incidence of paediatric tracheostomy in our hospitals
and communities and the baseline characteristics and
comorbidities of these children. Vaccination programs
and improvements in anaesthetic skills and equipment
have
significantly
reduced
the
need
for
emergency
tracheostomy due to airway obstruction, especially as a
consequence of upper airway infection [1]. The common-
est indications for tracheostomy in a child include: actual
or anticipated long-term ventilatory support; requirement
for broncho-pulmonary secretion management; or the
presence of a fixed upper airway obstruction, typically
subglottic stenosis, bilateral vocal cord paralysis, tumours
and congenital airway malformations and associated syn-
dromes [2–6]. Respiratory papillomatosis, caustic alkali
ingestion and craniofacial syndromes have increased
the frequency of paediatric tracheostomy over the past
decade,
although
evolving
surgical
techniques
such
as microdebridement may avoid tracheostomy in some
circumstances.
Tracheostomies may be required from the very first
days of life, including peri-delivery exit procedures for
known fetal airway abnormalities [7]. Approximately 1200
surgical tracheostomies were performed in children aged
16 years or less during 2014–2015 in England [8]. One-
third of the procedures were performed in children
under the age of one year and two-thirds in children
under the age of four years, a consistent finding since
the 1970s [9, 10]. An estimate from the USA in 1997 sug-
gested nearly 5000 paediatric tracheostomies were per-
formed [11]. Most case series report a higher incidence
of
male
children
requiring
tracheostomy,
probably
because they are more susceptible to genetic diseases
[12]. Tracheostomies may be temporary, although they
remain in situ significantly longer than temporary tra-
cheostomies in adult practice, especially if the child has a
degree of neurological impairment [13]. Similarly, tra-
cheostomies are much more likely to be required perma-
nently in children, with significant lifestyle changes for the
child and their parents or carers [14–16]. Children with
reversible, treatable or acquired pathologies, such as vocal
cord palsies or subglottic stenoses, are more likely to get
decannulated and the number of associated comorbidities
is linked to the likelihood of eventual decannulation [17].
Treatment can take months to years, sometimes waiting for
children to grow or to undergo staged maxillofacial or
head and neck reconstructive or corrective surgery.
Performing a tracheostomy and changing a tracheo-
stomy tube can be difficult in paediatric patients, due to
anatomical and technical factors. The trachea is small and
pliable and can be difficult to palpate, with the technical
challenges magnified by the short neck, head and neck
vessels and the pleura extending into the neck. The size of
the trachea dictates that a cartilage window should not be
used in children, to avoid creating a stenotic segment at the
site of the tracheostomy. Instead, a vertical tracheotomy is
used, which may hinder replacement of blocked, or dis-
lodged, tube until stoma maturation is complete. ‘Matura-
tion sutures’ are used to accelerate this process, and ‘stay
sutures’ are sited on either side of the vertical tracheostomy
to aid opening of the lumen in an emergency, before the
planned first tube change [18].
Tracheostomies
in
children
are
typically
open
surgical procedures, although percutaneous and hybrid
techniques have been described [19, 20]. In contrast,
adult tracheostomies are predominantly performed per-
cutaneously with the commonest indication being to aid
weaning from mechanical ventilation in the acutely criti-
cally ill [21]. Tracheostomy for children is usually a
planned procedure, often following relatively long stays
on the intensive care unit when compared with adult
practice [22].
Due to the small tracheal diameter, paediatric tra-
cheostomy tubes are generally uncuffed and do not have
an inner tube, to avoid reducing the internal diameter of
the tracheostomy tube lumen further [4]. Neonatal tra-
cheostomy tubes are shorter in length than the paediatric
tubes. Cuffed tubes are occasionally required if high ven-
tilation pressures are needed or if there is a high risk of
aspiration [23].
Around 20% of adults who undergo tracheostomy
in
the
UK
and
USA
do
not
survive
to

 discharge [24–27]. Comparable figures for paediatric
patients undergoing tracheostomy come from smaller
case series, but are typically reported at between 2%
and 10% with significant geographical variation [3, 9,
28–34]. In both age groups, mortality is largely due to
the significant underlying comorbidities that contribute
to
the
requirement
for
tracheostomy [35].
However,
morbidity
and
mortality
that
is
directly
due
to
the
tracheostomy itself does occur in the peri-operative,
hospital
and
community
settings,
contributing
to
a
significant healthcare resource burden [36].
Tracheostomy complications occur surprisingly fre-
quently and influence outcomes [37, 38]. One recent
North American paediatric tertiary centre study reported
early complications in 11% and late complications in
68.8% of all tracheostomies inserted [39], which is consis-
tent with other reported institutional case series [2, 30,
32, 33, 38, 40–43]. The early postoperative complication
rate in preterm infants may be double that of full-term
infants [44], and the requirement for tracheostomy in the
preterm period is also associated with poor developmen-
tal outcomes [45]. The commonest reported incidents
describe tube displacement, blockage or a tube being
pulled out [46]. Children who are ventilator dependant
have worse outcomes following an incident than those
breathing unaided [47]. Complications such as subglottic
stenoses or granuloma formation assume greater impor-
tance in the child due to the small calibre of the airway,
although
accidental
decannulation
may also
become
more prevalent as manual dexterity develops in older
children. The vast majority of significant events occur
more than one week after the tracheostomy insertion,
including catastrophic events occurring at home [28].
Medicolegal
reports
reinforce
the
potential
for
severe
and
permanent
damage
when
tracheostomy
complications occur, most commonly for peri-operative
negligence, dislodged tubes and mucous plugs. Award
amounts were high at a median of USD $2,000,000 in
one US study with otolaryngologists and nurses the most
commonly named defendants [48]. This demonstrates the
importance of proper training of all members of a multi-
disciplinary team, which is often found lacking [49].
Complications
and
incidents
relating
to
tracheo-
stomies and laryngectomies in adults have been well
documented in a series of national reports and analyses
of data registries [24, 26, 50–52]. When incidents occur,
some measureable harm is reported in 57 to 82%, with
the level of harm dependant on location [50, 51, 53, 54].
Recurrent themes that emerged from incident analyses
have led to common recommendations to improve care,
including the following:
•
Training
for
tracheostomy
emergencies
including
recognition
and
management
of
blocked
and
displaced tubes
•
Hospital-wide protocols and standardised training in
tracheostomy care
•
Bed-side information including details of the airway
and tracheostomy tube
•
Bed-side
tracheostomy
boxes
containing
essential
equipment for each patient
Understanding
the
potential
problems
with
tra-
cheostomy care led to the development of nationally
recognised guidelines for the management of adult tra-
cheostomy and laryngectomy emergencies, led by clini-
cians at the National Tracheostomy Safety Project (NTSP)
[55]. Emergency guidelines were supported by multidisci-
plinary stakeholder Royal Colleges and professional and
patient groups and a comprehensive package of educa-
tional resources (www.tracheostomy.org.uk). Implementa-
tion of these guidelines has had an impact on the quality
and safety of care [53]. These guidelines are, however,
not immediately applicable to children.
Although there are clear differences between adult
and paediatric tracheostomy care and practice, the recur-
rent themes we have identified are likely similar at an
institutional and organisational level [56]. Many of these
adverse events are avoidable [57], and are also amenable
to prospective quality improvement strategies [58]. There-
fore, the Paediatric Working Group of the NTSP was
established with the aim of developing paediatric tra-
cheostomy
emergency
guidelines,
using
a
similar
methodology to the previously published NTSP adult tra-
cheostomy emergency guidelines [55].
Our objective was to develop simple, clear and
authoritative guidelines that were specific for children
with tracheostomies, following wide consultation with key
national stakeholders and bodies involved in paediatric
tracheostomy care. Our focus was management of post-
placement incidents and the immediate management of
potentially life-threatening complications. As with the
adult guidelines, we aimed to produce resources that
were applicable to all multidisciplinary staff, regardless of
background, that could be taught consistently and easily
as part of standard education packages. These guidelines
were also to be applicable for carers and parents. Chil-
dren with a tracheostomy often have other comorbidities
that require care at different healthcare sites and hence

 the importance of having a standardised guideline for all
to use. The purpose of this article is to present these
paediatric guidelines and their rationale.
Methods
A Paediatric NTSP National Working Party was formed in
2013 comprising a multidisciplinary team of paediatric
ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeons, paediatric intensive
care unit (PICU) consultants, paediatric anaesthetists and
specialist
paediatric
tracheostomy
care
nurses
(both
hospital and community based) from paediatric hospitals
across the UK and Ireland.
A literature review was undertaken in November
2015 and updated in February 2017, which searched
databases (Embase, PubMed, Medline), search engines
(Google and Google Scholar) and NHS Evidence bases
(www.evidence.nhs.uk).
Scientific
papers
and
existing
national or institutional guidelines with English language
abstracts were retrieved and reviewed, along with any
resources known to the Working Party members. Appro-
priate consideration was given to ‘UK’ and ‘US’ spellings
of key words. Two authors (BM and CD) filtered publica-
tions, resources, websites, expert opinion and communica-
tions,
with
further
articles
retrieved
from
relevant
references. The majority of published literature regarding
paediatric tracheostomies consists of single-centre retro-
spective reviews of practice, detailing indications and sur-
gical
techniques,
with
few
reporting
emergency
management procedures [59, 60].
Identified consensus statements and best-practice
guidelines suggested that healthcare professionals who
look after children with tracheostomies should receive
regular training in routine and emergency airway man-
agement [61–63]. One national survey of US otolaryngol-
ogists
reported
that
98%
of
respondents
were
instructing families and carers of tracheostomised chil-
dren in the recognition of respiratory distress, emer-
gency
management
and
tube
replacement
[64].
However, comprehensive, universal guidance was not
described in the published literature. We also reviewed
local guidelines and policies for the management of
paediatric tracheostomy emergencies that were known
to the authors or retrieved through our search strategies.
Most detailed tracheostomy care bundles and daily care,
with little reference to emergency management.
This guideline recognises the lack of a consensus for
managing a paediatric tracheostomy emergency or paedi-
atric front-of-neck airway (FONA) and the limited evidence
for any chosen technique. We make recommendations to
guide the multidisciplinary responder, carer or team in
managing the commonest tracheostomy problems that
occur in children, using simple and familiar techniques
that are likely to be of benefit, before implementing more
advanced or invasive interventions. As with other difficult
airway management guidelines, regardless of the chosen
techniques,
prior
familiarity
and
preparedness
will
maximise the chances of success [65, 66].
The Paediatric Working Group had developed an
initial draft guideline in 2013 comprising emergency
algorithm and paired bedhead sign. The design of the
algorithm was based on the published guidelines for man-
agement of adult tracheostomy and laryngectomy emer-
gencies [55], with modifications where there were felt to
be significant differences in paediatric management. Early
versions were discussed among the Working Party and
our multidisciplinary colleagues, and were tested using
high-fidelity medical simulation at local bespoke meetings
using faculty and volunteers. Key steps were designed to
address contributing factors to poorly managed emergen-
cies, which include lack of access to information or emer-
gency algorithms, loss of situational awareness and poor
communication [50, 51]. We recognised the role that sim-
ulation could play in further refining the algorithm key
steps and have previously described testing versions of
the algorithm in over 450 volunteer healthcare profes-
sional encounters at national and international meetings,
where the algorithm was also formally presented [59]. We
were able to demonstrate significant improvements in per-
formance metrics when multidisciplinary responders fol-
lowed the algorithm in similar scenarios. Scenarios were
completed more quickly, the simulated children were less
hypoxic and more candidates called for help [59].
The near final version of the algorithm was agreed by
the Working Party and made freely available on the NTSP
website (www.tracheostomy.org) in May 2015. The algo-
rithm pages were accessed 99,096 times up to the end of
January 2017, with the paediatric algorithm viewed 4,250
times. Email
comments were invited
but none were
received. During this period, the algorithm was also
assessed in six tracheostomy emergency courses hosted
by
the
Advanced
Life
Support
Group
(www.
alsg.org) with detailed feedback from instructors and
participants.
The Working Party invited formal reviews of the algo-
rithm from several organisations with a stated interest in
patient
safety,
airway
management
and
professional
guidelines in children. These included the Advanced Life
Support Group, the Association of Paediatric Anaes-
thetists, the British Association of Paediatric Otolaryn-
gologists, the Global Tracheostomy Collaborative, the

Care
Society,
the
Resuscitation
Council (UK) and the Royal College of Paediatrics and
Child Health.
The Working Party agreed the final versions of the
algorithm and paired bedhead signs in January 2017
after reviewing feedback. The project has not been
directly funded, although the NTSP has supported some
meeting costs.
Results
Paediatric patients who require a tracheostomy are more
likely than adults to have a difficult or impossible to
manage native upper airway, and airway management is
made more difficult by intercurrent critical illness and
dependence
on
invasive
ventilatory
support
[67, 68].
As with the adult guidelines, several basic principles
underpin the paediatric guidance.
First, bedhead signs were adapted to provide essen-
tial initial information to emergency responders that was
specific to the child and to their particular tracheostomy,
consistent with the views of the Intensive Care Society, Dif-
ficult Airway Society, National Patient Safety Agency and
the adult NTSP work [52, 55, 69–71]. A wide range of tra-
cheostomy tubes and associated devices are available,
including some custom-made devices [72, 73]. Each has
specific features, which are important in an emergency
when suction or a tube change may be urgently required,
and regular carers, parents or the medical records are not
immediately available. As different manufacturers’ tubes
come in subtly different sizes and lengths, bedhead infor-
mation such as the internal diameter of the tracheostomy
tube, the calibre of suction catheters to be used, and the
depth that a suction catheter should inserted to should be
kept with the child at all times [72].
The bedhead signs also incorporate details of the
child’s upper airway patency, and ease of management.
We recommend that multidisciplinary teams complete
these fields based on historical airway management (from
anaesthetic charts or operation notes) or following airway
management procedures (often in theatre). It may be
clear that it is much easier to replace a tube into the tra-
cheostomy stoma or the native upper airway(s) should
tracheostomy blockage or displacement occur and this
information must be clearly communicated. We recom-
mend that completion of the bedhead sign be mandated
as part of the theatre sign out procedure following a new
tracheostomy
procedure,
or
airway
management
in
theatre.
There are two versions of this bedhead sign; the
‘NEW tracheostomy’ sign (Fig. 1a) is used up to first tube
change and the ‘Tracheostomy’ sign is used thereafter
(Fig. 1b). New stomas are likely to have the additional
safety features of ‘stay sutures’ (Figs. 2a and b) and ‘matu-
ration sutures’ (Fig. 3) which secure the edge of the
tracheal wall to the anterior neck skin [39, 63]. The
location and purpose of these sutures are documented
on the bedhead sign and the stay sutures are typically
removed at the first tube change. This often coincides
with discharge from a critical care environment to ward
level care. The (established) tracheostomy bedhead sign is
then completed.
Although much less common in children than an open
surgical procedure, if the tracheostomy has been percuta-
neously inserted, this should be clearly recorded on the
bedhead sign [19]. It is likely that the dilated tissues of a
percutaneously formed stoma will recoil in the event of
tube displacement, making re-insertion potentially more
difficult, especially in the first 7–10 days following inser-
tion [74]. This knowledge may direct responders to man-
age the upper airway as a priority. A surgically-formed
stoma can reasonably be expected to be matured enough
to allow safe tube exchange after three days, dependant
on patient factors or local practices [63].
The paired paediatric bedhead signs are provided
on the NTSP website in Microsoft PowerPoint format to
allow for local adaptations, and double-sided versions
ensure that the emergency management algorithm is also
immediately available.
The second principle that the Working Party adopted
from the adult guidelines was that the algorithm and bed-
head should be able to be used by multidisciplinary staff
who might care for a child in the community, secondary or
tertiary locations. Information should also be understand-
able by parents and carers and the algorithm should be
able to guide non-medically trained primary responders in
the initial management of tracheostomy emergencies.
These primary responders may not only include parents,
carers and community or school nurses but also hospital
staff with limited training and infrequent contact with tra-
cheostomy patients [75]. Such responders will be manag-
ing children with established stomas and are guided in
basic responses to tracheostomy emergencies. Respon-
ders with more advanced airway and tracheostomy skills
will manage children with new tracheostomies and provide
secondary support to the management of established
tracheostomy
problems.
The
algorithm
also
guides
secondary responders through basic management but
continues
to
primary
and
secondary
oxygenation
techniques. Two double-sided paired bedhead signs and
algorithms are therefore provided:

sented to an unfamiliar care setting (Fig. S1).
The overall style of the algorithms was based on the
successful flow charts produced by the Difficult Airway
Society and the NTSP [55, 66, 76]. The principle of oxy-
genation of the patient remained a priority. This does not
necessarily mean securing the airway by (re)insertion of
an airway device immediately, as less invasive methods
of oxygenation may be adequate and safer for respon-
ders to undertake, depending on equipment, environ-
ment and training [55, 76]. The second principle that was

used thereafter (b).

 retained was that the best assistance should be sum-
moned as early as possible. Ideally, assistance should
include other members of the multidisciplinary team who
are trained and competent to manage tracheostomy
emergencies,
working
in
adequately
staffed
and
equipped environments [77]. We recommend that details
of who to call in an emergency should be clearly
displayed on the bedhead sign and this should be
agreed
on
admission
to
the
clinical
area
or
upon
insertion of a new tracheostomy.
The following section includes detailed discussion and
explanation of the algorithm. This guidance is applicable to
any urgent or emergency situation that develops in a child
from
birth
to adolescence
who
has
an
existing
tra-
cheostomy. Adverse clinical signs may (or may not) be
apparent before an emergency occurs. Such signs have
been referred to as ‘Tracheostomy Red Flags’ and should
be familiar to staff caring for patients with tracheostomies
[78]. Red flags are summarised in Table 1. Red flags may or
may not be related to airway compromise.

 established management of the critically ill child, assess-
ment of the airway occurs first [79, 80].
The clinical situation may make it clear that deviation
from the order of the guided responses in the algorithm is
necessary. For example, if the initial assessment demon-
strates that a tracheostomy tube is visibly completely
displaced, then the responders should proceed to emer-
gency tube change and re-insertion. Similarly, if the patient
is bleeding from the tracheostomy or stoma site, the algo-
rithm will guide assessment of the airway with steps most
likely to restore or maintain patency. However, responders
must address any other acute clinical concerns such as
haemorrhage control and cardiovascular resuscitation in
parallel.
Initial assessment
The first steps of the algorithm concern approaching
safely, gentle stimulation of the child and shouting for
help: ‘Safety, Stimulate, Shout for help’. The algorithm
guides responders to assess the patency of the native
airway and tracheostomy using clinical assessment and
suction initially. Trained clinical staff or competent carers
should be capable of performing these assessments and
interventions. If the responder is not competent or confi-
dent, then it is appropriate to call for further help at this
point (‘2222’ hospital resuscitation team or ‘999’ for a para-
medic outside of the hospital environment).
Responders should next open the child’s native upper
airway and then assess for spontaneous breathing at the
upper airway and tracheostomy. Depending on the age of
the child, different positioning may be required to open
the upper airway, although a chin lift (‘sniffing the morning
air’) with or without jaw thrust is likely to be useful in chil-
dren of all ages [80]. A more neutral position may be useful
in children under two years of age and a pillow or rolled
towel under the child’s shoulders may improve airway
patency and access to the tracheostomy [60, 78, 79]. The
lateral position may be of benefit in some children, espe-
cially if there is known upper airway obstruction, although
this position may limit access to the anterior neck [81].
Patency of the airway should be evaluated by looking,
listening and feeling for airflow at the mouth/nose and
the tracheostomy (Fig. S2), supplemented by waveform
capnography where possible. Assessment may be aided
using
a
Mapleson
F
anaesthetic
breathing
circuit
if
available and if staff are competent to use this equip-
ment, as the movement of the bag can be helpful in
indicating gas movement via the airways, especially the
tracheostomy. Such a circuit can be attached directly to
the tracheostomy tube or applied over an open stoma if
the tracheostomy tube has been displaced. However,
care must be taken as attempting to ventilate through a
displaced tracheostomy can cause subcutaneous emphy-
sema and further complicate airway management [82,
83].
Additional clinical signs of respiratory distress or
airway obstruction should be sought while assessing the
airway. The most useful clinical signs are likely to be
stridor, accessory muscle use, tracheal tug, sternal, sub-
costal and intercostal recession, although an agitated,
restless or obviously distressed child may also have a
degree of airway obstruction and signs may become
absent as obstruction worsens [84].
High-flow
oxygen
should
be
delivered
to
the
patient’s face and to the tracheostomy if available. Note
that as two oxygen sources are required for this, both
wall oxygen and a second supply (e.g. the resuscitation
trolley) will be needed. Ideally, all tracheostomy patients
should be nursed at a bed with two oxygen pipeline

Doherty et al. | Multidisciplinary guidelines for the management of paediatric tracheostomy emergencies
 supplies. If only one oxygen supply is available, then this
should be applied to the airway from which spontaneous
breathing can be detected from (if the child is breathing);
the face or tracheostomy.
The competent use of waveform capnography has
been consistently identified as one of the key interven-
tions to improve the safety of airway management [52,
85–87]. We recommend that waveform capnography
should be immediately available in paediatric critical care
areas and available to be brought rapidly to the bed-side
of a child with a tracheostomy emergency anywhere
within a hospital. We recognise that oxygen and capnog-
raphy may not be available outside of the hospital
environment.
If the child is breathing spontaneously and gas flow is
detected via the tracheostomy tube, then the tube is at
least partially patent. If there are signs of respiratory
distress then proceed through the algorithm, otherwise
consider other causes for the deterioration that are not
related to the child’s tracheostomy. The ABCDE approach
advocated
by
the
Advanced
Paediatric Life
Support
guidelines is recommended [79].
Help and equipment
If the initial assessment demonstrates signs of respiratory
distress, further help should be summoned. Who is called
will depend on the patient, the responder, the location
and the time of day. Local arrangements for emergency
responders must be agreed as part of departmental and
hospital-wide policy and include contact methods for
clinical staff with advanced airway skills (often anaes-
thetists), ENT surgeons and/or specialist nursing staff.
The bedhead sign will detail who should be called and
how. Responders can vary from hospital to hospital and
depend on the time of day, but will often include resusci-
tation teams, plus specialists from ENT, anaesthesia,
paediatrics and paediatric intensive care.
Responders should ensure that emergency equip-
ment is brought to the patient. Paediatric trachi-cases
contain standardised emergency equipment for each
patient, are portable, and should be with the child at all
times (Fig. S1) [78]. Trachi-cases should also contain a
copy of the bedhead information and algorithm. Tracheal
dilators are not included in the emergency equipment as
there is potential to cause trauma in the smaller airway,
further compromising airway management [72]. Specialist
equipment for managing a likely difficult upper airway
must also be immediately available in critical care or
specialist locations and be able to be brought to the bed-
side in other clinical areas. This should include a range of
locally agreed facemasks, oral or nasal adjuncts, laryngo-
scope blades, videolaryngoscopes, fibreoptic or rigid
endoscopes, supraglottic airway devices and equipment
for front-of-neck access [55, 79, 80]. Similarly, anaesthetic
drugs must be available; immediately in critical care areas
and a system in place to deliver them rapidly to the
bed-side elsewhere within a hospital [88, 89]. It may be
appropriate to move the patient to a more specialist area
such as the operating theatre or intensive care unit.
Suction to assess tracheostomy patency
The basic response to assessing tracheostomy patency
continues by firstly removing any external attachments
from
the
tracheostomy
tube.
This
should
include
temporary
disconnection
from
a
ventilator
circuit
to
exclude problems with the circuit tubing or the ventilator
itself.
Ancillary
devices
include
heat
and
moisture
exchange (HME) filters, decannulation caps and speaking
valves, all of which can become blocked with blood or
secretions during routine use [90].
Inner cannulae contribute to reduced incidence of
tracheostomy tube blockage as part of a package of care
[71, 91], but will most likely only be present in tra-
cheostomies of older children owing to the resulting
reduced internal diameter. If present, the inner cannula
should be removed. Some inner cannulae need to be
replaced in order to connect the tracheostomy tube to
an anaesthetic breathing circuit [55].
Successful and easy passage of a suction catheter
through the tracheostomy tube and into the trachea to
the pre-determined length gives strong reassurance that
the tube is at least partially patent and is sited within the
airway [55]. Secretions that are present are suctioned and
the ABCDE assessment continued. A partially obstructed
tube may still need to be replaced. We do not recom-
mend using a bougie or a similar rigid device to assess
tube patency as if the tube is partially or completely dis-
placed from the airway, these stiffer devices are more
likely to create a false passage [92, 93]. Soft-tipped
suction catheters will not advance significantly into the
soft tissues [94, 95].
If the suction catheter cannot be passed easily to the
pre-determined depth indicated on the bedhead sign,
then the tracheostomy is likely blocked or displaced.

 attempting an emergency tracheostomy tube change
before attempting upper airway management in these
guidelines. A blocked or partially displaced tracheostomy
tube can be considered as a foreign body in the trachea
that must be removed. We recommend an emergency
tracheostomy tube change if initial assessment demon-
strates a lack of tracheostomy tube patency. An immedi-
ate attempt at re-insertion is also applicable if the tube
has become completely displaced from the neck, unless
the child was being considered for a trial of decannula-
tion. If stay sutures are present then they should both be
elevated by hand, lifting them ‘up and out’. Some staff
may
be
reluctant
to
remove
a
tracheostomy
tube,
especially if the child has a known difficult upper airway.
However, when faced with a deteriorating patient and an
obstructed airway, a non-functioning tracheostomy tube
offers no benefit, with considerable potential for harm
[96, 97]. By considering a blocked or displaced tracheost-
omy tube as a foreign body within the airway, improve-
ment can be anticipated upon removal.
We recommend that for the first emergency tube
change, a tracheostomy tube of the same size as the one
removed is used [61, 98]. For this first tube change we
do not recommend using an exchange guide such as a
bougie, wire or suction catheter, as the existing tube is
likely blocked, or displaced from its intended position.
We recommend the use of a dedicated obturator which
may ease insertion, reduce trauma and protect the stoma
[60, 92, 99, 100]. If the replacement tube appears to be
inserted successfully, we recommend a clinical assess-
ment of patency as described above, supported by wave-
form capnography if available. If the child has reduced or
absent respiratory effort, clinical assessment of patency is
more difficult. Easy passage of a suction catheter through
the new tube to the depth indicated on the bedhead
sign implies airway patency and, following this assess-
ment, an experienced responder may elect gentle hand
ventilation via the tracheostomy tube in the absence of
spontaneous
respiration.
We
do
not
recommend
attempts at ventilation if a suction catheter will not easily
pass as there is a significant risk of causing subcutaneous
emphysema if the tube has entered a false passage
(Fig. 5) [82, 83, 96].
If the first attempt at replacement is unsuccessful, a
second emergency tube change should be performed
with a tube one half-size smaller, again followed by
assessing for airway patency [61, 96, 98]. Using a tube
that is one half-size smaller than the original may make
insertion easier and as the tube is smaller in length, the
tip
may
then
sit
above
any
partial
obstruction
or
granuloma in the trachea. Changing the child’s position
may be helpful, further extending the neck to bring the
trachea anteriorly with a pillow or towel under the shoul-
ders (Fig. S2) [60]. A new tracheostomy will have stay
sutures which can be used to aid re-insertion by widen-
ing
the
stoma
and
bringing
the
trachea
anteriorly
[18, 39].
If the second attempt at replacement is unsuccessful,
we recommend a third attempt using a soft suction
catheter to guide placement, much like a Seldinger tech-
nique [60, 92]. This attempt should be made using a tube
that is one half-size smaller than the original tube and
with attention to positioning as above. Use of this third
step will depend on the clinical situation, location of the
patient, availability of other equipment, and any bleeding
from or swelling of the stoma site. This technique has
been preferred by rural and community practitioners with
limited options available in an emergency [60].
Difficulties replacing the tube can be varied due to
structural airway anomalies (trachea-bronchomalacia, false
tract, scar tissue), a distressed child or spasm of the sur-
rounding tissues, narrowing the stoma site.
Patency of an apparently successfully inserted tube
should be assessed clinically as described above. If the
replacement tube is not patent then it must be removed.
If the replacement tube cannot be inserted after three
attempts, we do not recommend further attempts at
insertion.
Assessment of breathing and rescue breaths

Doherty et al. | Multidisciplinary guidelines for the management of paediatric tracheostomy emergencies
 ventilation. If the patient is breathing spontaneously via
the nose/mouth or tracheostomy tube or open stoma,
then oxygen should be applied to that site, or both sites.
If the child is improving then a clinical decision needs to
be made about the best people, equipment and location
to secure a definitive airway and the urgency of manage-
ment.
If there are no signs of breathing, then an assess-
ment for ‘signs of life’ and a pulse check should occur.
Cardiopulmonary
resuscitation
should
follow
routine
Advanced Paediatric Life Support guidelines, ensuring
that advanced help, resuscitation teams or an ambulance
has
been
called
as
appropriate
[79].
The
following
‘advanced response’ section of these guidelines should
be utilised during resuscitation to aid with management
of airway and breathing, as a blocked or displaced tra-
cheostomy could have been a cause of hypoxia and the
cardiorespiratory deterioration.
We recommend attempting to deliver five rescue
breaths to the child if they are not breathing, or sponta-
neous ventilation is inadequate at this point. This may be
evidenced by cyanosis, low oxygen saturations, bradycar-
dia, clinical signs of respiratory distress or obstruction, or
an unresponsive child. Rescue breaths should be deliv-
ered using high flow oxygen where possible, although
mouth-to-mouth
or
mouth-to-tracheostomy
ventilation
has been described [101].
If the child has a patent upper airway, rescue breaths
should be delivered via a facemask. If the upper airway is
obstructed, then these should be delivered via the stoma.
Effectiveness of ventilation should be judged clinically,
supported by waveform capnography where possible
[85, 102]. Techniques are discussed in detail in the next
sections.
Primary emergency oxygenation
There are essentially two airway options to consider for
emergency oxygenation: either via the mouth or via the
tracheostomy stoma. Information from the bedhead sign
will guide responders as to which airway is likely to be
easier, and the clinical experience of the responders may
also influence which airway they are more comfortable
managing.
We
recommend
a
graded
response
to
managing the airway: responders are first guided to use
the least invasive techniques that have the highest likeli-
hood of success. More invasive techniques have higher
complication rates and although these may be required
to ultimately ‘secure’ the airway, less invasive techniques
may facilitate re-oxygenation to allow safer definitive air-
way management.
Standard oral airway manoeuvres may be appropriate
and are familiar to most clinical staff. We recommend stan-
dard management as for any patient who is not breathing
such as bag-valve masks, oral or nasal airway adjuncts and
supraglottic airway devices (SAD) [103]. Second-generation
SADs allow more effective ventilation at lower peak infla-
tion pressures, offer a degree of separation between the
oesophagus and trachea which may reduce the aspiration
risk, and may be easier to insert and secure [104, 105].
Supraglottic airway devices have been successfully used in
the
emergency
and
out-of-hospital
environments
in
children [106, 107]. The stoma must be occluded to
prevent air escaping via the neck, which would reduce the
effectiveness of ventilation. We recommend the use of a
gloved finger or non-woven (‘surgical’) gauze for occluding
the stoma.
If ventilation via the upper airways is not possible or
inadequate, ventilation may be attempted via the stoma.
We recommend using a paediatric facemask or SAD such
as a LMA� laryngeal mask1 applied over the stoma [108]
attached to a bag-valve mask (Fig. 6). The upper airway
may need to be closed to facilitate effective ventilation
via the stoma.
If non-invasive primary measures fail to oxygenate the
child, more invasive secondary techniques may be required.
Intubation may be achieved via the upper airway using stan-
dard techniques, recognising that the incidence of difficult
airways in children with tracheostomies is high [80]. Difficult
SAD ventilation and facemask ventilation are both known to
be more common after failed intubation, increasing the like-
lihood of progression to a can’t-intubate, can’t-oxygenate
(CICO) scenario [109]. Responders should prepare for diffi-
culty in intubation and consideration of operator, environ-
ment and equipment must be made. This is especially
important if sedative or neuromuscular blocking drugs are
administered. We recommend that the first attempt at trans-
laryngeal intubation be made with an tracheal tube one half-
size smaller than the original tracheostomy tube. An uncut
tracheal tube can be carefully advanced beyond the stoma
in patients with a patent upper airway [55]. Micro-cuffed
tracheal tubes may be used. Appropriate sizes should be
indicated on the bedhead sign.
If intubation of the upper airway is known to be impossi-
ble or fails, we recommend attempting intubation of the tra-
cheostomy stoma itself using a tracheal tube one half-size
smaller than the original tracheostomy tube [110, 111]. This
may be a simple, temporary, yet life-saving alternative where

 tracheostomy tube insertion has failed and is especially
useful in an emergency [112]. Translaryngeal intubation of
the trachea or intubation of the stoma may be assisted by
specialist equipment such as videolaryngoscopes, fibreoptic
or rigid endoscopes, guidewires or airway exchange cathe-
ters [74, 113, 114].
If intubation of the upper airway or stoma is not suc-
cessful and the child cannot be oxygenated by the face
or
stoma,
this
CICO
situation
should
be
explicitly
declared to the attending team. This is a desperate situa-
tion and cardiac arrest should be anticipated. Options at
this point include:
•
Further attempts or advanced or assisted intubation
of the upper airway or stoma by more experienced
responders using specialised equipment [115]
○
Intubation endoscopes (e.g. BonfilsTM, BambrinkTM)
○
Hopkins rod lens-telescope
○
Flexible fiberoptic endoscopes
•
Attempted cricothyroidotomy
•
Emergency surgical exploration of the stoma and
attempts at percutaneous or surgical tracheostomy
[116, 117]
•
Extracorporeal
membrane
oxygenation
may
be
possible in some units [118, 119]
Following
emergency
re-intubation
of
the
upper
airway or stoma, waveform capnography should be used
to confirm tracheal placement. Clinical examination may
identify accidental endobronchial placement, but is insen-
sitive and airway endoscopy or chest X-ray may be
required [120, 121]. Pharyngeal or oesophageal injury
may have occurred [122].
Special circumstances
Tracheostomy bleeding can be immediate, early or late
in presentation and can be minor, moderate or life
threatening.
Causes
include
traumatic
suctioning,
granulomata,
local
infection,
bleeding
disorders
and
rarely (but frequently fatal) haemorrhage from tracheo-
arterial fistulae. Minor bleeding can be managed in a
conservative manner with careful observation; most usu-
ally settle with no surgical intervention. Tracheo-arterial
fistulae should be suspected with moderate bleeding
from the stomal site or pulsation of the tracheostomy
tube. A sentinel bleed is reported in around one half of
cases
[123].
If
suspected,
a
tracheostomy
tube
cuff
should be (hyper)inflated, if present. Alternatively, intuba-
tion of the stoma using a cuffed tracheal tube maybe
required, with the tube tip placed distal to the fistula.
Pressure may be applied via a hyperinflated cuff or digi-
tally, either directly or applied to the innominate artery
site. Standard resuscitation measures should occur in tan-
dem and emergency plans made for definitive surgical
treatment, which is usually ligation of the innominate
artery [124].
Fractured paediatric tracheostomy tubes are rarely
reported [111, 125, 126]. There are specific susceptible
points at the junction of the tube and the neck plate, the dis-
tal end of the tube and the fenestration site [127]. They can
present as an airway foreign body and should preferably be
removed using a bronchoscopic technique.
Discussion
The purpose of this paper is to provide clear, practical
guidance in preparing for, recognising and managing
common tracheostomy emergencies that occur in paedi-
atric patients. Much like existing guidelines for airway
management
or
cardiopulmonary
resuscitation,
these
standardised management plans are directly transferable
between hospitals and locations in which children with
tracheostomies may be managed [66, 80, 128]. The
guidelines are directed at multidisciplinary responders
who
may
not
be
airway
or
tracheostomy
experts,
recognising that some staff may have specialist skills that
compliment or enhance the strategies described.

Doherty et al. | Multidisciplinary guidelines for the management of paediatric tracheostomy emergencies
 While complications from airway and tracheostomy
management are infrequent, the consequences can be
significant for the patient, family, responding teams and
institutions, ranging from unnecessary or preventable
admissions to significant harm and death [68, 129].
However,
published
literature
concerning
airway
complications and management strategies in children is
limited, especially regarding tracheostomies. While these
guidelines, therefore, represent expert opinion based on
the available evidence, external advice has been sought
and considered from individuals and from relevant stake-
holder organisations.
Paediatric
tracheostomy
patients
are
a
transient
population, being managed in tertiary and community
hospitals
and
environments,
requiring
a
variety
of
hospital-based procedures, and represent a distinctly dif-
ferent population to adults with tracheostomies, meriting
separate guidelines. The principles of providing emer-
gency oxygenation and limiting the number of unneces-
sary airway interventions are retained from the adult
guidelines, but key differences include:
•
Bespoke paediatric bedhead signs reflecting paedi-
atric tracheostomy indications and pathologies
•
Recognition
of
(almost)
exclusively
surgical
tra-
cheostomies with stay sutures and maturation sutures
available to aid emergency management
•
Initial management includes up to three attempts at
emergency tracheostomy tube changes
•
Use of suction catheters to guide re-insertion
Existing guidance suggests that healthcare profes-
sionals
who
look
after
children
with
tracheostomies
should receive regular training in routine and emergency
airway management [3, 4]. While patients are increasingly
complex and require the input of multidisciplinary teams
and healthcare professionals, we hope that the publica-
tion of these guidelines will support standardised training
for multidisciplinary staff [29]. Standardised, structured
educational programmes are also of benefit to parents
and carers and may have a positive impact on carer con-
fidence and patient safety in the community [16, 75, 130,
131]. The NTSP has developed e-learning, resources and
courses to support these guidelines (www.tracheostomy.
org.uk).
While the primary aim of these guidelines is to improve
the emergency management of paediatric tracheostomy
emergencies, wider developments include addressing the
safety and quality of care, with the aim of reducing the inci-
dence of airway emergencies. Initiatives such as the Global
Tracheostomy
(Quality
Improvement)
Collaborative
(www.globaltrach.org) can support organisational improve-
ments and by collecting patient-level metrics, quantify the
effectiveness of care bundles, protocols, and of training,
equipping and supporting staff in delivering high-quality
care [63, 132–134]. Improving transitional and community
paediatric tracheostomy care may also improve the safety
and quality of care and reduce emergency department visits
[130,
135].
These
multidisciplinary
guidelines
for
the
management of paediatric tracheostomy emergencies are
an important element of improving tracheostomy care.
