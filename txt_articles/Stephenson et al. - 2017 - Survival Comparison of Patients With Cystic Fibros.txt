Abstract
Background—In 2011, the median age of survival in cystic fibrosis (CF) reported in the United 
States (US) was 36.8 years compared to 48.5 years in Canada; however direct comparison of 
survival estimates between national registries is challenging because of inherent differences in 
methodologies used, data processing techniques, and ascertainment bias.

 Objectives—To use a standardized approach to calculate CF survival estimates and to explore 
differences between Canada and the United States (US).
Design—Population-based study.
Setting—42 Canadian CF clinics and 110 CF care centers in the US.
Patients—Patients followed in the Canadian CF Registry (CCFR) and the US Cystic Fibrosis 
Foundation (CFF) Patient Registry (CFFPR) between 1990 and 2013.
Measurement—Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare survival between 
patients followed in the CCFR (n=5,941) and CFFPR (n=45,448). Multivariable models were used 
to adjust for factors known to be associated with survival.
Results—Median age of survival in patients with CF increased in both countries between 1990 
and 2013; however in 1995 and 2005, survival in Canada increased at a faster rate relative to the 
US (p<0.001). Using contemporary data from 2009-2013, the median age of survival in Canada 
was ten years greater than the US (50.9 vs. 40.6 years, respectively). The adjusted risk of death 
was 34% lower in Canada compared to the US (hazard ratio 0.66, 95% CI 0.54-0.81). A greater 
proportion of patients had transplants in Canada (10.3% vs. 6.5% respectively, SD 13.7). 
Differences in survival between US and Canadian patients varied according to the US patients' 
insurance status.
Limitations—Ascertainment bias as a result of missing data or non-random lost to follow-up 
could impact the results.
Conclusions—Differences in CF survival between Canada and the US persisted after adjusting 
for risk factors associated with survival. Differential access to transplantation, improved post-
transplant survival and differences in the healthcare systems may, in part, explain the Canadian 
survival advantage.
Introduction
A comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to medical care, early treatment of pulmonary 
disease and aggressive management of malnutrition has translated into longer lives for 
individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF).(1-3) Life expectancy depends on a patient's 
characteristics, as well as their access to medical care and medications, which may vary both 
within and between countries.(4;5) Comparisons of national CF registry data have led to 
important discoveries in CF disease progression and increased our understanding of 
epidemiologic trends in CF mortality and clinical care.(6-12) Recently, Goss et al. showed 
that pulmonary function among patients ages 6-25 years was higher in CF patients in the 
United States (US) compared to the United Kingdom (UK), which was associated with 
differential prescribing of inhaled mucolytic therapies between the two countries.(7)
In 2011, the median age of survival for CF in the US Annual Registry report was 36.8 years 
whereas it was 48.5 years in the Canadian CF Registry report.(13;14) Direct comparison of 
median age of survival estimates between national registry reports is problematic due to the 
inherent differences in methodologies used, data processing techniques, and ascertainment 
bias.(15;16) We recently showed that survival estimates may be over- or underestimated

 depending on how data are captured and processed, and the proportion of missing data.(15) 
Using a standardized approach to data processing and survival calculations would provide 
greater confidence in international comparisons and in the identification of factors that may 
contribute to the observed differences.
The objectives of this study were (1) to determine whether using a standardized approach to 
data processing and survival calculations confirmed the observed difference between Canada 
and the US, and (2) if a survival gap persisted, to explore potential contributing factors. We 
hypothesized that differences in survival between the countries could be explained by 
variations in clinical characteristics of the patient populations, differential rates of 
transplantation and variations between the health care systems.
Methods
This population-based cohort study used prospectively collected Canadian CF Registry 
(CCFR) and US CF Foundation (CFF) Patient Registry (US CFFPR) data from 1990 to 2013 
inclusive. Each CF center that submits data to the registry obtains patient consent for data to 
be collected. This study was approved by the Research Ethics Board at St. Michael's 
Hospital, Toronto, Ontario (Research Ethics Board # 14-148) and at Seattle Children's 
Hospital (Institutional Research Board # 15294).
A detailed description of both registries as well as information on how individuals are 
accrued and monitored within each registry is outlined in the online supplement. The CCFR 
and the US CFFPR contain detailed demographic and clinical information on patients with a 
confirmed diagnosis of CF(17) receiving clinical care at accredited CF centers across 
Canada and the US. Data including age, sex, age of diagnosis, race, symptoms at 
presentation, whether or not the patient was diagnosed through newborn screening, date of 
transplantation, date of death and cause of death, as well as anthropometric measurements, 
lung function, bacteriology, CF-related complications, and pancreatic status are collected.
Each variable within the Canadian and US registries was evaluated by the research team and 
comparisons were made regarding data definitions and how data are collected so that a 
unified approach to each variable was established. Because the CCFR records the first stable 
clinical measurement per person per year, we selected the first stable measurement of the 
year for each subject within the US CFFPR in order to mirror the method of data collection. 
A stable measurement was defined as one that is taken from a routine outpatient clinic visit 
when the patient was not being treated for a pulmonary exacerbation. Missing date of 
diagnosis was imputed using date of birth plus 30 days whereas age at diagnosis was 
categorized as < 2 or ≥ 2 years of age.(18) Genotype was classified as homozygous delta 
F508, heterozygous delta F508, other, or missing. Race was categorized as Caucasian, other, 
or missing. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was expressed as a percentage 
of the predicted values for healthy age and gender matched controls using GLI reference 
equations.(19) Body mass index percentiles (BMI%ile) were calculated for children between 
two and 19 years of age using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts.
(20) Children were then classified as: underweight (BMI%ile ≤ 12%), adequate weight 
(BMI%ile 13-84% or overweight (BMI%ile ≥ 85%).(21) For individuals 19 years of age and

 older, subjects were classified into BMI categories based on World Health Organization 
guidelines(22) as underweight (<18.5 kg/m2), adequate weight (18.5-24.9 kg/m2), or 
overweight (≥ 25.0 kg/m2). Based on the literature, respiratory bacteria can have a 
differential effect on survival. For those individuals who grew multiple organisms from 
respiratory tract specimens in a given year, we categorized patients based on the organism 
that had the worst prognosis in terms of survival. This categorization allowed us to create 
mutually exclusive groups to avoid combining less virulent organisms with ones associated 
with a worse prognosis. Using this hierarchical classification, patients with multiple types of 
bacteria cultured in a given year were categorized as follows: Burkholderia cepacia complex 
took precedence over any other type of infection, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus 
(MRSA) took precedence over Pseudomonas aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa took precedence over 
all remaining organisms. CF-related diabetes (CFRD) was defined by the clinic based on 
published consensus guidelines.(23) Pancreatic status was determined by pancreatic enzyme 
replacement therapy usage. Pancreatic status was used as a surrogate for disease severity in 
the multivariable analysis since CFTR genotype and pancreatic status are highly 
correlated(24) and fewer patients had missing data for pancreatic enzyme replacement 
therapy. Previous literature suggests that the majority of patients who were reported as lost 
to follow-up at some point during the follow-up period will return to the CF center within 2 
years of non-attendance.(5) Thus, subjects were considered lost to follow-up if they had no 
death date recorded and their last reporting year was more than two years from the end of 
the study. The single-payer universal health insurance program in Canada provides 
comprehensive medical care to all Canadian citizens whereas the US employs a multi-payer 
approach to healthcare. Patients in the US were grouped into mutually exclusive categories 
according to their health insurance coverage as follows: chronic Medicaid or Medicare 
(receiving Medicaid and/or Medicare in all five years), intermittent Medicaid and/or 
Medicare (receiving Medicaid or Medicare in at least one but not all five years), other (any 
other insurance outside of Medicaid or Medicare, which is predominantly employee-
provided private insurance), none/unknown insurance (none or unknown insurance unknown 
or in all five years) for the US patient population and universal healthcare for the Canadian 
population.
Statistical Analyses
Demographic and clinical variables were summarized by country, with categorical variables 
expressed as frequency and proportion, and continuous variables summarized as median and 
range. Differences between countries were compared using the Mann-Whitney test for 
continuous variables and the Chi-square test for categorical variables. P-values are heavily 
influenced by sample size, and thus the large sample sizes herein will render very small 
differences statistically significant. As such, the standardized difference (SD) was utilized to 
determine statistical significance. A SD of greater than ten was used to determine significant 
differences between the countries.(25)
We used period survival analysis to calculate median age of survival estimates over time. 
Median age of survival for each year was calculated for each five-year window beginning 
with 1986-1990, and ending with the 2009-2013 time period. Differences in median age of 
survival between the two countries over time were evaluated from 1990 to 2013 using 
Stephenson et al.

 segmented regression analysis to determine whether there were significant change points 
when the differences in median age of survival diverged.(26)
We further explored differences in survival by adjusting for patient and clinical 
characteristics using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards (PH) model using data from 
the most recent five years (2009-2013), which reflects a contemporary cohort of CF patients. 
The multivariable Cox PH analysis was first conducted on data from all patients, including 
those who were transplanted, and adjusted for time-independent characteristics (sex, race, 
age at diagnosis, pancreatic status) and transplant status. Subsequently, we conducted 
additional multivariable analyses which included time-varying clinical characteristics known 
to be prognostic for patient survival, such as FEV1, BMI, CFRD, and microbiology. We 
excluded individuals under the age of 6 years because lung function measurements are not 
reliably measured until subjects are 6 years old. Since clinical outcomes post-transplant, 
particularly FEV1, do not represent CF lung disease, this analysis censored patients at the 
time of transplant. Country, sex, age at diagnosis, race, genotype, pancreatic status, and 
insurance status were modeled as time-independent covariates. Missing lung function and 
BMI measurements were imputed using multiple imputation(27) (see online supplement for 
additional details on survival calculations and imputation methodology).
Patients with milder clinical phenotypes have better survival therefore, a differential 
proportion of patients with milder CF disease in the two countries would bias the survival 
estimates. In order to address this potential ascertainment bias, we conducted several sub-
group analyses. The multivariable Cox PH models were repeated limiting the sample to 
patients with a severe clinical phenotype as defined by 1) pancreatic status (i.e., pancreatic 
insufficient subjects); 2) homozygous delta F508 subjects; and 3) subjects diagnosed before 
the age of two years.(17;28) To address the differences in healthcare systems between the 
two countries we further classified the US subjects by insurance status and compared the 
risk of death in these subgroups to Canada as a whole, which has universal healthcare. The 
insurance status classification has been used in previous studies as Medicaid and Medicare 
have been associated with worse outcomes in CF.(29;30) Because the hierarchical approach 
to microbiology used in our study has not been commonly used in registry studies, we 
conducted a sensitivity analysis whereby we classified pertinent subjects as having co-
infections with multiple bacteria.

Results
Longitudinal Trends in Survival over Time (1990-2013)
There were 45,448 and 5,941 patients followed in the US and Canadian registries 
respectively between 1990 and 2013, with 9,654 (21.2%) and 1,288 (21.7%) deaths 
respectively. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the CF patients followed between

 1990 and 2013 are included in the online supplement (Table S1). Median age of survival in 
both countries increased over the study period (Figure 1a). However, the rate of 
improvement in median age of survival over time between the two countries diverged in 
1995 and 2005 (Davies Test p<0.001) (Figure 1b); most notably in 2005 when the 
improvements in the Canadian population were greater. The rate of change in survival 
between males and females differed by country (p<0.001). Canadian male survival grew at a 
significantly faster rate compared to US males (p<0.001) from 2005 onwards whereas there 
was no statistically significant difference in survival improvement over time between the two 
countries for females (p=0.19). Changes in the median age of death over time and the 
difference in median age of death between the two countries are summarized in the online 
supplement in Figure S1.
Contemporary CF Population (2009-2013)
The demographic and clinical characteristics of the contemporary CF cohort are summarized 
in Table 1. A higher proportion of subjects were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis in the 
US compared to Canada (19.9% vs. 10.9%, SD 22.4), which corresponds to a higher 
prevalence of newborn-screened subjects in the US (17.3% vs. 6.2%, SD 34.4). A greater 
proportion of patients had transplants (any organ) in Canada (10.3% vs. 6.5% respectively, 
SD 13.7). Seventy-eight percent of all patient deaths in the US occurred among individuals 
never transplanted compared to 61% of deaths in the Canada (SD 38.0). Overall, fewer 
Canadian patients were lost to follow-up in the registry (2.5% vs. 5.5%) and a higher 
proportion of the lost to follow-up patients in the US were post-transplant compared to 
Canada (12.2% vs. 8.0% respectively, SD 13.9). The characteristics of the patients lost to 
follow-up in both countries is shown in the online supplement (Table S8).
The median age of survival in Canada was ten years higher than the US (50.9 years (95% 
CI: 50.5-52.2) vs. 40.6 (95% CI: 39.1-41.8) years respectively). The median age at death 
was 26.9 years in the US compared to 31.9 years in Canada (SD 29.5). The risk of death 
between the countries was consistently lower in Canada compared to the US in multiple sub-
groups of the population (Figure 3). In order to account for the differential lost to follow-up 
post-transplant between the two countries, we re-calculated median survival age censoring 
patients on the date of transplant, which effectively excluded post-transplant survival time as 
well as deaths after transplant in both countries. This analysis caused the survival gap 
between the two countries to widen further (57.1 years vs. 44.0 years in Canada and US 
respectively).
Details regarding the creation of the study cohort used for the multivariable analysis are 
presented in Figure 2 and a summary of the demographic and clinical characteristics of the 
included patients can be found in the online supplement (Table S2).
In the multivariable model which adjusted for patient characteristics only, the risk of death 
was 41% lower in Canada compared to the US (HR 0.59, 95% CI: 0.52-0.68, p<0.001, 
n=37,080). (Table 2). In the model which adjusted for both patient characteristics and 
clinical factors, the risk of death remained significantly lower in Canada compared to the US 
(HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.54-0.81; p=0.002).(Table 3) There was no evidence of a statistically 
significant interaction between country and any of the clinical factors. When US patients

 were categorized according to their insurance status, Canadians had a 44% lower risk of 
death compared to those in the US receiving continuous Medicaid/Medicare (n=6,230, 
24.3%) (HR 0.56, 95% CI: 0.45-0.71, p<0.001), a 36% lower risk compared to US patients 
on intermittent Medicaid/Medicare (n=8,429, 32.9%) (HR 0.64, 95% CI: 0.51-0.80, 
p=0.002) and a 77% lower risk of death compared to US patients with unknown or no health 
insurance (n=205, 0.8%) (HR 0.23, 95% CI: 0.14-0.37, p<0.001). There was no difference in 
risk of death between Canadians and individuals in the US with “other” insurance 
(n=10,754, 42.0%), including private insurance (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.67-1.07, p=0.15). (see 
online supplement, Table S3) To address potential ascertainment bias, the analyses were 
limited to severe patient phenotypes. Canadian CF patients consistently had a statistically 
significant lower risk of death in all sub-groups (see online supplement, Tables S4-S6). 
Further, results were unchanged regardless of the method used to classify patients into 
microbiologic categories (See online supplement, Table S7).
Discussion
Our study confirms a significant survival gap between Canada and the US in individuals 
living with CF. In the most recent time period (2009-2013), a ten-year survival advantage 
was identified for patients living in Canada which cannot be attributed to methodology or 
data processing techniques. The risk of death was consistently lower in Canada after 
accounting for multiple patient demographic and clinical factors, and persisted in patients 
with severe clinical phenotypes. The systematic approach used to compare data from these 
two countries demonstrates that national disease registries can be meaningfully compared 
and can elucidate factors associated with differences in survival. While we cannot draw 
definitive causal inferences from these analyses, the observed differences raise the question 
of differences in access to therapeutic approaches or health care delivery, such that 
hypotheses can be generated for further investigation.
Although our study was not designed to specifically evaluate the impact of transplant on 
survival, few therapeutic interventions have the ability to impact survival in a short time 
period, and several of our findings supported the hypothesis that transplantation may be 
contributing to the observed survival gap. Firstly, we found that more Canadians with CF 
received a transplant in the contemporary study period compared to US CF patients despite 
having similar proportion of patients with severe lung disease based on FEV1. Secondly, a 
higher proportion of deaths in the US occurred in patients who had not received a transplant 
compared to the Canada. Thirdly, when we censored patients at transplant, the median age of 
survival increased from 10 years to 13 years suggesting transplant contributes to the survival 
gap. And lastly, we observed a significant widening of the survival gap between the 
countries since 2005, a year that corresponds to a marked change in how US CF patients 
were prioritized for lung transplant with the implementation of the lung allocation score 
(LAS) in May 2005, which is not used in Canada.(31)
Existing literature further supports the possible role that transplant plays in the Canada-US 
survival gap. For instance, median survival post-lung transplant is longer in Canadian CF 
patients compared to published studies of US CF patients.(32) (33) Although the LAS has 
been associated with shorter waiting times and improved transplant survival(35), and the

 number of patients with CF listed for lung transplantation has increased since its 
implementation, the proportion who have received a transplant has decreased.(36) In 
addition, Merlo et al showed that CF patients transplanted since the LAS was implemented 
had a higher risk of death compared to CF patients transplanted in the pre-LAS period.(35) 
These studies suggest that differential access to lung transplant and survival post-transplant 
between Canada and the US may contribute to the survival gap although this hypothesis 
requires further study.
Although transplant may play a role, there are likely other factors that are contributing to the 
survival gap seen. One such factor may be the substantial difference in healthcare delivery 
between Canada and the US. In Canada, universal healthcare provides all individuals with 
the opportunity to access medical services across the country; in the US, differing health 
insurance coverage impacts access to medical care and costs of care and is related to 
socioeconomic status (SES).(30;33) Indeed we observed health insurance status in the US 
had a differential effect on the risk of death for individuals living with CF compared to 
Canada. Interestingly, there was no statistically significant difference in risk of death among 
Canadians and those in the US with “other” insurance (which was comprised primarily of 
individuals with private coverage). We were unable to draw firm conclusions on the impact 
of SES on the survival gap since the Canadian registry did not capture SES data. While all 
Canadians have access to healthcare regardless of SES, this does not imply that SES does 
not impact survival in Canada. There are hidden financial factors that may limit the ability of 
patients to seek medical attention in Canada, for example, the costs associated with taking 
time off work, driving long distances to be seen at a CF center, or having to relocate to a CF 
transplant center. The fact that the risk of death in the US varied by the type of health 
insurance raises the possibility that differences in the health care systems may explain part 
of the survival gap documented; however, further study is needed to formally evaluate this 
question.
Previous comparisons between Canada and the US in the 1980's suggested that 
implementation of aggressive nutritional support in the early 1970s in Toronto led to 
improved survival compared with Boston.(6) As a result, the high-fat diet was adopted 
worldwide for individuals with CF. Those born in Canada in the 1970s would have been 
exposed to aggressive nutritional supplementation from birth and the impact of early 
nutrition would have reduced their risk of death in their later teen and early adult years. As 
such, one would expect that US survival would catch up to Canada since CF centers in the 
US also implemented the high calorie diet, albeit 5-10 years later.
The strengths of our study include the large sample size, the longitudinal data within both 
CF registries, the consistency of our results across multiple sub-groups and the unified 
approach to the analysis. There is a high participation rate in both registries and CF clinics 
receive financial incentives for data submission which results in a comprehensive national 
picture of the CF population. However, missing vital statistics could result in biased survival 
estimates, particularly if there was a disproportionate number of missing events in one 
country compared with the other.(15) Prior literature suggests death dates are missing in the 
US CFFPR, particularly in those over the age of 45 years, when compared to national vital 
statistics;(37) whereas the number of deaths in the CCFR is similar to Canadian vital

 statistics.(5) If the US data were preferentially missing deaths, this would result in an 
overestimation of the true US CF survival. Our data also show that there were more US 
patients lost to follow-up compared to Canada, which would have the opposite effect on 
survival estimates (typically having more patients lost to follow-up results in an 
underestimation of median survival).(15) It is also worth noting that more of the US lost to 
follow-up patients had characteristics associated with a worse prognosis for example, female 
sex, non-Caucasian race, pancreatic insufficiency, CFRD etc. (Table S8) compared to 
Canada. By preferentially excluding US patients with a worse prognosis from the survival 
analysis, the survival gap may actually be wider than reported in our study. Differential 
inclusion of patients with a mild clinical phenotype in the registry may result in a survival 
gap simply because one country captures patients with mild disease compared to another 
country. The fact that our findings were consistent across multiple subgroups, including 
those that have a severe clinical phenotype, suggests that higher survival in Canada relative 
to the US is not due to following milder patients in the Canadian cohort. Differences in 
medication use may play a role in the survival gap; interestingly, between 2011 and 2013 
medication use was higher in the US, however we were unable to examine medication for 
the full study period due to lack of medication data prior to 2011 in Canada. While 
environmental factors such as air pollution or climate may impact lung health in CF, these 
data were not equally available within the registries (air pollution data have only been linked 
to the US CFFPR). Newborn screening (NBS) programs have been in place longer in the US 
compared to Canada however this is unlikely to significantly affect the current survival 
estimates as there are relatively few pediatric deaths in both countries. Furthermore, having 
more extensive NBS programs in the US would bias the results towards the null as these 
individuals would presumably be healthier. Regional or center-specific death rates between 
the countries were not conducted due to relatively few deaths within any given center which 
would produce unreliable survival estimates.
In conclusion, we show a difference in survival between Canada and the US even after 
adjusting for patient characteristics and clinical factors known to be associated with survival. 
The survival differences appear to diverge at two distinct time points, most notably in 2005, 
when the gap between the two countries widens. Differential access to transplantation 
related to the referral or donor lung allocation process, variable post-transplant survival and 
differences in the healthcare systems may, in part, explain the Canadian survival advantage. 
Further studies are necessary in order to specifically test these hypotheses.

Difference, standardized difference
All values are summarized based on the last recorded measurement in the time period.
aDifferences between countries were compared using the Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables. P-values are heavily influenced by sample size, and 
thus the large sample sizes herein will render very small differences statistically significant. As such, the standardized difference was utilized to determine statistical significance.
bThe standardized difference is the mean difference as a percentage of the average standard deviations. A standardized difference greater than 10 is generally used to determine those variables that remain 
sufficiently different between the two countries.
cThe patient's first transplant of any type is considered only
dLost to follow-up is defined as patients who are alive but whose last available year of data occurs more than 2 years before the cohort end year. That is, a patient would be considered lost to follow-up if 
their last available reporting year is 2011 or earlier.
ePercent predicted FEV1 was calculated using the GLI reference values using the subject's FEV1 value from the most recent year of follow-up.
fBMI categories are defined using the WHO classification. The patient's BMI in the most recent year of follow-up was used.
gAs treatment data are only available in the Canadian registry beginning in 2011, these estimates are calculated for the 2011-2013 window.
hOut of a total of 3,530 Canadians and 23,855 Americans over the age of 6 and with no prior transplant.
iOut of a total of 2,186 Canadians and 15,398 Americans over the age of 6, with no prior transplant and infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa at some point in the 2011-2013 window.
