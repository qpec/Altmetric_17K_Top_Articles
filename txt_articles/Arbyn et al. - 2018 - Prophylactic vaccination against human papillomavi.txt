Additional comments
The authors of this systematic review are recognised experts in the field of cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination and have
contributed substantially to the bulk of knowledge on the pathogenesis of HPV-induced carcinogenesis, or are involved in the
development of guidelines on cervical cancer prevention. The co-authorship is balanced, with certain co-authors having a conflict of
interest and others explicitly not having a conflict of interest. Given the scientific weight of authors, it seems realistic that
manufacturers owning the data of trials will be willing to provide additional requested non-published information. The reader should
be aware that the authors have thorough knowledge of the field and that this could potentially generate a bias. However, the second
author, AB (statistical advisor of the Gynaecological Cancer Cochrane Group), is not an HPV expert and his methodological expertise
offers a certain degree of protection against possible bias from pre-knowledge.

Abstract
This is the protocol for a review and there is no abstract. The objectives are as follows:
To evaluate the immunogenicity, clinical efficacy, and safety of prophylactic HPV vaccines in
females. The assessment of clinical efficacy will address protection against HPV infection (for
homologous and heterologous HPV types), against re-infection, against cervical cancer and its
precursors (high-grade CIN (grade 2 or grade 3), adenocarcinoma in situ) in women previously not
exposed to HPV infection (negative at enrolment for both HPV DNA and antibodies against the
vaccine HPV types). We will assess clinical effectiveness by evaluating outcomes in all women,
irrespective of the HPV DNA or serology status at enrolment. Evaluation by fine age and time
since sexual debut categories is also planned.
BACKGROUND
Description of the condition
Association between human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical
cancer and other HPV-related cancers and their precursors—The development of
cervical cancer passes through a number of phases: (a) infection of the cervical epithelium
with certain human papillomavirus (HPV) types; (b) persistence of the HPV infection; (c)
progression to precancerous lesions (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and (d)
eventually invasion. All phases are reversible, except for the last one (Bosch 2002;
Arbyn et al.

 Castellsague 2006; IARC 2007). Recently, an IARC (International Agency for Research on
Cancer) expert group reviewed the carcinogenicity of human papilloviruses and confirmed
that for 12 HPV types (HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, and 59) sufficient
evidence exists that they are causally linked with the development of cervical cancer
(Bouvard 2009). Type HPV 68 is considered as probably carcinogenic (Schiffman 2009).
The HPV type 16, in particular, has a high potential for malignant transformation of infected
cervical cells (Schiffman 2005). The HPV types 16 and 18 jointly cause 70% of all the
cervical cancers worldwide (Munoz 2004). Moreover, HPV type 16 is also linked with rarer
types of cancer, namely cancer of the vulva and vagina in women, penis cancer in men and
anus, oropharynx and larynx cancer in women and men (Cogliano 2005; IARC 2007). IARC
2007
The main route of HPV transmission is sexual. Infection with HPV usually occurs soon after
the onset of sexual activity (Winer 2003; Winer 2008). The prevalence of HPV infection
generally peaks in late teenage or early twenties and declines thereafter (De Sanjose 2007).
Human papillomavirus infection usually clears spontaneously, in particular in women
younger than 30 years. Human papillomavirus infection can result in intraepithelial
neoplastic cellular lesions which are identifiable by cytological examination (ASCUS, LSIL,
HSIL, see list of abbreviations in Appendices) and which can be confirmed histologically
(CIN1-3)*. These lesions generally regress, but the probability of regression decreases, and
the likelihood of progression to cancer increases with the duration of HPV infection and the
severity of the lesion. From historical data, it has been estimated that CIN3 incurs a
probability of progressing to invasive cancer of 12% to 30%; whereas for CIN2 this
probability is substantially less (McCredie 2008; Ostor 1993).The natural history of HPV
infection to invasive cancer takes a minimum of 10 years and a median of approximately 25
to 30 years (IARC 2007).
A World Health Organization (WHO) expert group accepted a reduction in the incidence of
high-grade CIN (CIN2+) and cervical adenocarcinoma (AIS) or worse as an acceptable
surrogate outcome of HPV vaccination trials, since the reduction of the incidence of
invasive cervical cancer would require large and lengthy studies which are unlikely to be
undertaken (Pagliusi 2004). The low-risk HPV types 6 and 11 cause approximately 90% of
genital warts in women and men (Lacey 2006). They occur in low-grade dysplastic cervical
lesions but are not associated with cervical cancer (IARC 2007). Moreover, HPV types 6
and 11 cause recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, a rare but very serious disease of the
upper airways often requiring repetitive surgical interventions (Lacey 2006).
The recognition of the strong causal association between HPV infection and cervical cancer
has resulted in the development of HPV assays to detect cervical cancer precursors (Iftner
2003), and even vaccines that prevent HPV infection (prophylactic vaccines) or that treat
HPV-induced lesions (therapeutic vaccines) (Frazer 2004; Galloway 2003; Schneider 2003).
Therapeutic vaccines are still in very early experimental phases and are not further
considered in this review.
* Throughout this review, we will use the 2001 Bethesda System to define cytologically
defined neoplastic lesions of the cervical epithelium (Solomon 2002) and the CIN

 nomenclature to define histologically confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (Richart
1973).
Burden of cervical cancer—Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in
women worldwide (Ferlay 2004). It is estimated that in 2002, approximately 493,000
women developed cervical cancer and that 273,000 died from the disease (Ferlay 2004).
Eighty-three per cent of cervical cancer cases occur in developing countries. Cervical cancer
is the predominant female cancer in Sub-Saharan Africa, Central America and South-Central
Asia, where a woman’s risk of developing this disease by age 65 years ranges between 2.1%
and 3.2%. In many developed countries, the incidence of, and mortality from, squamous
cervical cancer has dropped substantially over the last decades as a consequence of
widespread screening (Arbyn 2009; Arbyn 2009a; Bray 2005a; IARC 2004). For instance,
In the USA and North and West-Europe, the cumulative risk of cervix uteri cancer up to age
65 years is 0.7% or lower (Ferlay 2004). However, approximately 52,000 and 13,000 cases
are reported each year in Europe and the USA, respectively (Ferlay 2004). Moreover, the
incidence of adenocarcinoma of the cervix is less affected by cytological screening (Bray
2005; Smith 2000). In contrast to many other malignancies, cervical cancer primarily affects
younger women, with the majority of cases appearing between the ages of 35 and 50 years
(Yang 2004). In Europe, approximately 40% of women with cervical cancer die from the
disease within five years of diagnosis (Sant 2009).
Description of the intervention
In this review, we will only study prophylactic HPV vaccines composed of virus-like
particles of the L1 protein, which is the major protein of the capsid of the HPV virus.
To date, three prophylactic HPV vaccines have been developed and clinically evaluated in
randomised controlled trials (RCTs): a monovalent HPV16 vaccine (manufactured by
Merck, Sharpe & Dome (Merck), Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA); a quadrivalent vaccine,
containing the L1 protein of HPV6, HPV11, HPV16 and HPV18 (Gardasil®, produced by
the same manufacturer); and a bivalent vaccine containing L1 of HPV types 16 and 18
(Cervarix®, produced by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Rixensart, Belgium) (Koutsky 2002).
The vaccine produced by Merck contains amorphous aluminium hydroxyphosphate sulphate
as an adjuvant, whereas the GSK vaccine contains aluminium salt and ASO4 or
monophosphoryl lipid A, which is an immunostimulating molecule (WHO 2009). More
details about prophylactic HPV vaccines used are described in Appendix 1.
Animal experiments have shown that neutralising antibodies, elicited by vaccination with
papillomavirus VLPs, prevent type-specific infection and subsequent lesions after viral
challenge (Breitburd 1995;Ghim 2000; Stanley 2006). Vaccination by intramuscular
injection of L1 VLPs in humans has been demonstrated to be highly immunogenic and well-
tolerated in phase I trials. (Ault 2004; Brown 2001; Evans 2001; Harro 2001;).
Why it is important to do this review
Several phase II and III studies have been conducted to date and numerous reviews have
tried to summarise the results (Arbyn 2007; Ault 2007; Harper 2009; Initiative 2009; Kahn
Arbyn et al.

 2009; Kjaer 2009; Koutsky 2006; Medeiros 2009; Rambout 2007; Szarewski 2010).
However, none of the reviews combined information on all the available endpoints. This is
due to incomplete reporting of data, use of different assays, analyses of different per
protocol or intention-to-treat groups, outcome definitions, lumping of different outcomes,
and reporting at variable time points in the scientific literature. Previous reports have also
not comprehensively evaluated the impact of vaccination by fine categories of age and time
since sexual debut, have not systematically evaluated evidence for cross-protection against
HPV types phylogenetically related to HPV-16/18, and have not specifically addressed the
question of whether vaccination protects against re-infection among younger and older
individuals known to be infected at vaccination and who subsequently clear their infections.
The objective of this review is to summarise all available (published and unpublished)
evidence by combining outcomes with similar definitions and times of measurement. We
will request missing outcomes or outcome data missing at specific time points.
OBJECTIVES
To evaluate the immunogenicity, clinical efficacy, and safety of prophylactic HPV vaccines
in females. The assessment of clinical efficacy will address protection against HPV infection
(for homologous and heterologous HPV types), against re-infection, against cervical cancer
and its precursors (high-grade CIN (grade 2 or grade 3), adenocarcinoma in situ) in women
previously not exposed to HPV infection (negative at enrolment for both HPV DNA and
antibodies against the vaccine HPV types). We will assess clinical effectiveness by
evaluating outcomes in all women, irrespective of the HPV DNA or serology status at
enrolment. Evaluation by fine age and time since sexual debut categories is also planned.
METHODS
Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies—We will only consider randomised controlled trials (RCTs).
Types of participants—We will include studies that enrol only females, without any age
restriction. However, if possible, study participants will be distinguished by age group,
sexual history and initial HPV status.
We will not include studies with male participants or special target groups such as
immunocompromised patients.
Types of interventions
Intervention: Vaccination with prophylactic HPV vaccines containing virus like particles
composed of the L1 capsid protein of HPV16 (monovalent vaccine), HPV16 and HPV18
(bivalent vaccine), or HPV6, HPV11, HPV16 and HPV18 (quadrivalent vaccine) (see
Appendix 1). All vaccines are administered by intramuscular injection over a period of six
months. The monovalent and quadrivalent vaccines are injected at zero, two and six months,
whereas the bivalent vaccine is administered at zero, one and six months.

 Comparison: Administration of placebo containing no active product or only the adjuvant
of the HPV vaccine without L1 VLP, or another nonHPV vaccine.
In comparisons of bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines, participants who receive the bivalent
vaccine will constitute the experimental group and participants who receive the quadrivalent
vaccine will be considered as the comparison group.

 Electronic searches—We will retrieve published studies from the Cochrane
Gynaecological Cancer Review Group’s Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register
of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, latest issue), MEDLINE and
EMBASE. We have provided the search strategy for MEDLINE in Appendix 2; we will
design a similarly structured search strategy to run in EMBASE and to search CENTRAL.
We will save the search string for MEDLINE in My NCBI, an electronic search tool
developed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at the National
Library of Medicine, which saves searches and automatically retrieves newer references not
picked-up at previous searches. We will also set up an auto-alert in EMBASE.
We will use the ‘related articles’ feature in PubMed, departing from the original included
studies; similarly, we will use Scopus to retrieve articles which cite the originally included
studies.
We will search databases from 2002 (the year of publication of the results of the first phase
II trial) until the present day.
Searching other resources
Websites of regulatory authorities responsible for approval of HPV vaccines for
human use: We will consult the websites of the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA)
and the European Medicine Agency (EMEA) to retrieve additional data not included in
published scientific articles. In particular, we will verify the European Public Assessment
Reports (EPAR) established by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use
(CHMP) of EMEA for the two HPV vaccines authorised in the European Union:
•
http://www.emea.europa.eu/humandocs/Humans/EPAR/cervarix/cervarix.htm;
•
http://www.emea.europa.eu/humandocs/Humans/EPAR/gardasil/gardasil.htm.,
We will retrieve data provided by the FDA via the following sites:
•
for the quadrivalent vaccine: http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/
Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/ucm094042.htm;
•
for the bivalent vaccine: http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/
ApprovedProducts/ucm186957.htm.
Registries of randomised trials: We will search the following registries for ongoing trials:
www.metaregister.com, www.controlled-trials.com/rct, www.clinicaltrials.gov and
www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials.
International public health organisations: We will contact international public health
organisations that have investigated questions on HPV vaccine efficacy and safety or that
have formulated recommendations on the use of HPV vaccines, to retrieve key documents.
Concerned organisations include: the World Health Organization (WHO, Geneva), the US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, Atlanta), the European Centre for
Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC, Stockholm), and the International Agency for
Research on Cancer (IARC, Lyon).

 Handsearching: We will handsearch the citation lists of included studies.
In addition, we will search the abstracts of the latest conferences of relevant scientific
societies related to vaccination, virology (in particular the Papillomavirus Society),
paediatrics, and gynaecology for new or pending information not yet published in peer-
reviewed journals.
Correspondance: We will contact the principal investigators of included studies and
manufacturers of prophylactic HPV vaccines (MSD, USA) and GSK (Rixensart, Belgium)
to obtain available data already published but not sufficiently detailed in published reports.
We will develop data sheets to record commonly defined, and timed and efficacy outcomes
stratified by age group, sexual history and initial HPV status. We will complete these sheets
with data extracted from published reports and we will request any missing data from data
owners.
In addition, we will request information on pending or planned relevant trials from principal
investigators and researchers of the vaccine manufacturers.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies—We will download all titles and abstracts retrieved by electronic
searching to a bibliographic database stored in Reference Manager. We will add any
references we obtain by handsearching and remove duplicates.
Two review authors (MA and AB) will independently verify inclusion and exclusion of
eligible studies and we will discuss any disagreements. In case of doubt, we will read the
full report. If no consensus can be reached, we will consult with other review authors. We
will document reasons for exclusion.
Data extraction and management—For included studies, we will extract the following
study characteristics and outcome data.
•
Study identification: first author, year of publication, journal, trial number.
•
Geographical area where the study was conducted.
•
Period when study was conducted.
•
Inclusion and exclusion criteria.
•
Characteristics of included participants (total number enrolled, number of drop-
outs, age, continent, ethnic origin, comorbidity, contraceptive use, number of
previous sexual partners, obstetric and gynaecological antecedents, smoking
history).
•
Initial HPV status (presence or absence of hrHPV DNA; presence or absence of
DNA of the vaccine HPV types; serological status (presence of antibodies against
vaccine HPV types) at enrolment). Differences in efficacy outcomes by initial HPV
status will reflect protection in women or girls previously exposed, or not exposed
to prior HPV infection.

Involvement of manufacturers.
We will extract data on outcomes as follows.
•
For dichotomous outcomes, we will extract the number of participants in each
treatment arm who experienced the outcome of interest and the number of
participants assessed at endpoint in order to estimate a risk ratio (RR) or risk
difference (RD). Where possible, we will also extract the number of person-years at
risk in order to compute incidence rates and incidence rate ratios or differences.
•
For time to event data, the review authors will extract the log of the hazard ratio
(log(HR) and its standard error (SE) from trial reports. If these are not reported, or
computable from other reported statistics, we will use Adobe Photoshop (Adobe
2007) to prepare digital prints of the published Kaplan-Meier survival curves (or its
complement, the cumulative incidence curve) and note the minimum and maximum

 duration of follow-up in order to estimate the log (HR), using the methods
proposed by Parmar 1998.
•
For continuous outcomes, the review authors will extract the final value and
standard deviation (SD) of the outcome of interest and the number of participants
assessed in each treatment arm at the end of the considered follow-up, in order to
estimate the mean difference (MD) between treatment arms and its SE, if trials
measured outcomes on the same scale; otherwise we will compute standardised
mean differences (SMD).
Two review authors (MA, AB) will independently extract data onto a data abstraction form
specially designed for the review. We will resolve differences between review authors by
discussion or by appeal to a third review author (PMH) if necessary.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies—We will assess the risk of bias in
included RCTs using The Cochrane Collaboration’s tool and the criteria specified in chapter
8 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2008). This
will include assessment of:
•
the method used for randomisation to generate the sequence of participants
allocated to the treatment arms;
•
allocation concealment;
•
blinding (of participants, healthcare providers and outcome assessors);
•
reporting of incomplete outcome data for each outcome;
•
selective reporting of outcomes;
•
other possible sources of bias.
Two review authors (MA, AB) will independently apply the risk of bias tool and we will
resolve differences by discussion or by appeal to a third review author (PMH). We will
present results in both a risk of bias graph and a risk of bias summary. We will interpret the
results of meta-analyses in the light of the findings with respect to risk of bias.
Measures of treatment effect
•
We will compute RRs from the proportions or rates among trial participants
showing effects in the treatment arms for the dichotomous variables. For vaccine
efficacy (VE), we will also express treatment effects as VE = (1-RR)*100, where a
high level of protection will yield values approximating 100%.
•
We will assess time to development of infections or lesions using HRs.
•
We will assess the evolution of the serologic response to immunisation by MD or
SMD in antibody level (preferentially expressed in IU) of type-specific antibodies
at different time points, as well as the ratio of the mean antibody level of type
specific antibodies in women who have been vaccinated versus women in the
control group who are seropositive because of a natural infection. We will make a

 distinction between overall antibody titres and virus-neutralising antibody titres, if
possible.
Dealing with missing data—We will contact study authors or data owners to request
data on the outcomes that were not reported.
We will not impute missing outcome data.
If data are reported for grouped end points, we will contact trial authors or data owners to
request data on the separated outcomes. We will use a grid of commonly defined and timed
outcomes for this purpose. In addition, we will solicit results stratified by initial HPV status,
age and sexual history if these have not been reported.
Assessment of heterogeneity—We will assess heterogeneity between studies by visual
inspection of forest plots, by estimation of the percentage heterogeneity between trials which
cannot be ascribed to sampling variation (Higgins 2003), by a formal statistical test of the
significance of the heterogeneity (Deeks 2001) and, if possible, by subgroup analyses. If
there is evidence of substantial heterogeneity, we will investigate and report the possible
reasons.
We will avoid heterogeneity caused by combining data series from participants with
different initial HPV status (presence of HPV DNA, anti-HPV antibodies). We will
investigate age group and sexual history as potential sources that could explain possible
heterogeneity.
Assessment of reporting biases—We will examine funnel plots corresponding to
meta-analysis of the primary outcome to assess the relation between sample size and
treatment effects. When there is evidence of small study effects, we will consider
publication bias as only one of a number of possible explanations. If these plots suggest that
treatment effects may not be sampled from a symmetric distribution, as assumed by the
random-effects model, we will perform sensitivity analyses using fixed-effect models.
Data synthesis—If sufficient clinically similar studies are available, we will pool the
results in meta-analyses.
•
For dichotomous outcomes, we will pool RRs, VEs or RDs.
•
For time-to-event data, we will pool HRs.
•
For continuous outcomes, we will pool the MD or SMD between treatment arms.
We will apply random-effects models with inverse variance weighting for all meta-analyses
of RRs, HRs and SMDs using the Review Manager (RevMan) 5 facility (DerSimonian
1986).
For cluster RCTs, if the analysis accounts for the cluster design then we will extract a direct
estimate of the desired treatment effect e.g. RR plus 95% confidence interval (CI). If the

 outcome data, ignoring the cluster design, for all women in each group. Next, using an
external estimate of the intracluster coefficient (ICC), we will estimate a design effect.
Hence, the variance of the effect estimate will be inflated. It will then be possible to enter
the data into RevMan (Cochrane Editorial software package) and combine the cluster
randomised trials with individually randomised trials in the same meta-analysis, using the
generic inverse variance method of meta-analysis.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity—We will base particularly
important subgroup analyses on separation of participants being initially hrHPV DNA
negative, HPV16/18 DNA negative, or HPV16/18 DNA positive. If possible, we will further
subdivide these subgroup analyses by initial serological status (presence of antiHPV16/18
antibodies). When published data are not clearly separated by initial HPV status, we will
request them from the owners of the databases. Age group and previous sexual experience
are particularly important stratifying covariates, which we will request from data owners if
insufficiently reported and which we will use for meta-regression.
We will consider a particularly interesting subgroup analysis depending on available data,
and we will base this on participants having received only two doses of vaccine. This
subgroup analysis could be added to results from planned trials evaluating efficacy of
reduced number of administrations (Eggertson 2007).
We will attempt to project reported study outcomes to the nearest multiple of 12 months to
account for differences in the timing of reporting.
Type of vaccine and certain other study covariates (see Data extraction and management)
may be considered as objects for subgroup meta-analysis or meta-regression (Sharp 1998;
Thompson 1999).
Sensitivity analysis—We will perform sensitivity analyses excluding studies at moderate
or high risk of bias (see: Assessment of risk of bias in included studies).
