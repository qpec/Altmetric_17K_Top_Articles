 Networks in ACA Marketplaces are Narrower for Mental Health Care
Than for Primary Care
Abstract
In 2016, ACA marketplace plans offered provider networks that were far narrower for mental health care than
for primary care. On average, plan networks included 24 percent of all primary care providers and 11 percent
of all mental health care providers in a given market. Just 43 percent of psychiatrists and 19 percent of
nonphysician mental health providers participate in any network. These findings raise important questions
about network sufficiency, consumer choice, and access to mental health care in marketplace plans.

 THE QUESTION
Forming networks of low-cost providers is one way that insurers can 
control costs and offer lower premiums in ACA marketplace plans. 
Nearly half of plans offer “narrow” networks, generally defined as networks 
with less than 25 percent of providers in a given market. Networks that are 
too narrow, however, may jeopardize access to primary or specialty care. 
This is particularly true in mental health care, where many providers did 
not participate in any insurance networks before the ACA. 
Thus, the authors sought to answer two questions: first, how mental 
health care providers compare to primary care providers in terms of 
their participation in ACA networks and the size of the networks they 
are in; and second, in the context of efforts to achieve parity between 
mental health care and general medical care, the extent to which parity in 
network size exists. The study looked at both physicians and nonphysician 
providers.  
THE FINDINGS
The study identified 531 unique provider networks offered by 281 
different insurers on the marketplaces. It analyzed data from 535,114 
primary care providers [52 percent physicians, 48 percent nurse 
practitioners (NPs) or physician assistants (PAs)] and 562,379 mental 
health care providers (9.2 percent psychiatrists, 18.4 percent psychologists, 
71.2 percent nonphysician behavioral specialists, counselors, or therapists; 
1.3 percent NPs or PAs).
Network size.  Mental health care networks were more narrow than 
primary care networks. For example, 57.4 percent of plans had narrow 
networks of psychiatrists, compared to 38.7 percent of plans with narrow 
networks for primary care physicians. The difference holds for networks 
of nonphysician providers as well, where nearly 90 percent of plans had 
narrow networks of mental health care practitioners, compared to about 
75 percent of plans with narrow networks for primary care practitioners. 
On average, plan networks included only 11.3 percent of all mental health 
care providers and 24.3 percent of all primary care providers in a given 
market.
Network participation. Overall, 21.4 percent of mental health care 
providers and 45.6 percent of primary care providers participated in at 
least one network in their county. Participation was significantly different

by specialty and by provider type (Exhibit 
1). Specifically, 42.7 percent of psychiatrists 
participated in at least one network, compared 
to 58.4 percent of primary care physicians, a 
difference of 15.7 percentage points. Nonphysician 
providers had even lower participation; for example, 
just 19.3 percent of nonphysician mental health care 
providers were in any network (23.4 percentage 
points lower than psychiatrists).
T
o explore whether provider participation in 
networks could explain differences in network 
size, the authors looked at the subset of providers 
that participated in at least one network (Exhibit 
2). In this subset, specialty differences decreased: 
the average network included 28.3 percent of 
participating mental health providers and 35.2 
percent of participating primary care providers. 
This suggests that much of the narrowness of 
mental health care networks is due to low provider 
participation.
Parity. The authors found little correlation in 
network size for different specialties. Plans with 
broader networks of primary care providers did not 
necessarily have larger networks for mental health 
care providers. There was little parity in network 
size, with most plans having larger networks for 
primary care than for mental health care.
THE IMPLICATIONS
This study highlights important structural barriers 
to adequate access to mental health care and 
parity with general medical care in marketplace 
plans. Mental health care is one of the ten “essential 
benefits” that must be offered in ACA plans, 
but network participation among mental health 
care providers remains low. This contributes to 
the narrowness of mental health networks and 
may undermine the ability of both federal parity 
laws, such as the 2008 Mental Health Parity and 
Addiction Equity Act, and the ACA to guarantee 
access to mental health care. 
Previous research found that psychiatrists are 
the least likely physicians to accept Medicaid, 
Medicare, and commercial insurance, and therefore 
to participate in provider networks. Because of high 
demand for mental health services, psychiatrists 
have market power to choose not to participate 
in networks that reimburse them at low rates for 
time-intensive services. Improving consumer 
choice, therefore, will require provider interventions 
THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT MUCH OF 
THE NARROWNESS OF MENTAL HEALTH 
CARE NETWORKS IS DUE TO LOW 
PROVIDER PARTICIPATION.

that tackle inadequate reimbursement rates, address the administrative 
burden of managed care, and relieve workforce shortages. There is a 
need to expand network participation among high-quality, lower-cost 
nonphysician mental health providers to supplement or substitute for 
some care usually provided by psychiatrists.
Furthermore, the authors’ findings of broader primary care networks 
and higher primary care provider participation suggest an important 
supplementary access point for mental health care. As primary care 
physicians provide more mental health services, implementing more 
effective models of collaboration between primary care providers and 
mental health care providers becomes critical.
These findings suggest that the use of narrow networks could exacerbate 
existing challenges in meeting mental health care demands. In response, 
federal and state policy should clarify network adequacy standards to 
assure mental health care parity and reasonable access to care.
THE STUDY
The authors compared mental health and primary care providers in 2016 
ACA plan using plan, network, and provider level data. They obtained a 
list of providers participating in each network from Vericred, a company 
that maintains complete provider-network data. Provider characteristics 
such as specialty and type were obtained from the Centers for Medicare 
and Medicaid Services, and plan characteristics such service area were 
obtained from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s Health Insurance 
Exchange data set. They identified 531 unique provider networks offered 
by 281 different insurers, representing a nearly complete picture of plans 
on the ACA marketplaces. 
The mental health provider group included psychiatrists and nonphysician 
mental health specialists such as psychologists, specialized NPs and PAs, 
and other behavioral specialists, counselors, and therapists with masters 
or doctoral degrees. The primary care provider group included physicians 
with a primary care internal medicine specialty, and nonphysicians such as 
NPs and PAs.  
Eligible providers for a network practiced in a county where a plan 
associated with the network was sold. Participating providers were 
those assigned to at least one plan network offered in the marketplaces. 
Network size was estimated by the ratio of the number of providers 
participating in each network to the total number of providers eligible 
for network participation in each state, and by the ratio of the number of 
providers participating in each network to the total number of providers 
participating in at least one network in each state. The authors also 
categorized network size with consumer-friendly groupings used in prior 
studies. Specifically, “narrow” networks were defined as including fewer 
than 25 percent of total providers in the state.
Study limitations included the absence of social workers in the dataset, 
and incomplete information on behavioral health carve-outs, which use 
specialized management firms to deliver mental health care to enrollees. 
These may result in under-reporting of mental health care providers.
