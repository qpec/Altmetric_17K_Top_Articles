Background.
After decades of obscurity, Zika virus (ZIKV) has spread through the Americas since 2015 accompanied by con-
genital microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Although these epidemics presumably involve transmission by Aedes aegypti, no
direct evidence of vector involvement has been reported, prompting speculation that other mosquitoes such as Culex quinquefascia-
tus could be involved.
Methods.
We detected an outbreak of ZIKV infection in southern Mexico in late 2015. Sera from suspected ZIKV-infected pa-
tients were analyzed for viral RNA and antibodies. Mosquitoes were collected in and around patient homes and tested for ZIKV.
Results.
Of 119 suspected ZIKV-infected patients, 25 (21%) were confirmed by RT-PCR of serum collected 1–8 days after the
onset of signs and symptoms including rash, arthralgia, headache, pruritus, myalgia, and fever. Of 796 mosquitoes collected,
A. aegypti yielded ZIKV detection by RT-PCR in 15 of 55 pools (27.3%). No ZIKV was detected in C. quinquefasciatus. ZIKV sequences
derived from sera and mosquitoes showed a monophyletic relationship suggestive of a point source introduction from Guatemala.
Conclusions.
These results demonstrate the continued, rapid northward progression of ZIKV into North America with typically
mild disease manifestations, and implicate A. aegypti for the first time as a principal vector in North America.
Keywords.
Zika; flavivirus; arbovirus; mosquito; transmission.
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus in the family
Flaviviridae, which includes human-pathogenic arthropod-
borne viruses (arboviruses) such as dengue virus (DENV), yel-
low fever virus, and West Nile virus. It was first discovered in
the Zika forest of Uganda, in 1947, during investigations of en-
zootic yellow fever, and the first human cases of ZIKV infection
were described in 1954, in Nigeria. However, until 2007, only 14
sporadic human cases were reported, although serological stud-
ies and virus isolation from mosquitoes suggested widespread
ZIKV circulation in Africa and Asia [1, 2].
The first major outbreak of ZIKV infection was detected in
2007 in Yap Island, where up to 73% of the population was es-
timated to have been infected [3]. Another outbreak occurred
the same year in Gabon [4]. These were followed by a large ep-
idemic in French Polynesia in 2013–2014, where up to 66% of
the population was infected [5], and spread of ZIKV to New
Caledonia, the Cook Islands, Easter Island, Vanuatu, and the
Solomon Islands [6]. In the Americas, phylogenetic analyses
suggest ZIKV importation into Brazil from the Pacific in 2013
[7]. In early 2015, the first ZIKV infections were described in
Brazil [7], harbingers of an explosive hemispheric epidemic.
As of August 2016, local ZIKV infections had been reported
in 45 countries and territories in the Americas, with the epi-
demic spreading throughout most of northern South America
and nearly all of Central America and the Caribbean [8], pre-
sumably through travelers who initiated transmission by the
urban mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti. Many countries in
North America and Europe have also reported hundreds of im-
ported cases. The lack of direct evidence of A. aegypti infection
has led to speculation that other common tropical urban mos-
quitoes, such as Culex quinquefasciatus, could be involved [9].
Culex species have not been associated with ZIKV transmission
during outbreaks in Yap [3],Gabon [4],or French Polynesia [2].
However, other Aedes species have been implicated in urban
transmission in Gabon [4] and Oceania [2, 3, 10].
Serosurveys suggest that most ZIKV infections are asymp-
tomatic [11]. In symptomatic cases of Zika fever (ZIKF), signs
and symptoms are similar to those described for infections by

A. aegypti Transmission of Zika Virus in Mexico, 2015 • JID 2016:214 (1 November) • 1349

 DENV and chikungunya virus (CHIKV), 2 other arboviruses
present in most regions affected by ZIKV, making diagnosis
challenging. ZIKF typically includes fever, arthralgia, maculo-
papular rash, conjunctivitis, and retro-orbital pain. However,
ZIKV can also lead to more-serious neurological complications,
such as Guillain-Barré syndrome and, in newborns, congenital
microcephaly syndrome [12–16].
In southern Mexico, near the Guatemala border, an increas-
ing number of patients exhibiting conjunctivitis, fever, and rash
was observed in Tapachula and surrounding rural localities in
November 2015. Initially, medical personnel were confused be-
cause 12 months earlier, a major chikungunya fever (CHIKF)
outbreak affected the same region [17]. However, most cases
did not present with arthralgia of the hands and feet, which is
typical of CHIKF, and the retroocular pain seen in most cases,
which is not typical of CHIKF, was suggestive of dengue. Blood
samples were obtained from patients showing signs and symp-
toms consistent with ZIKF, including fever, conjunctivitis, my-
algias, retroocular pain, and rash. Mosquitoes were also
collected in and around the homes of patients with suspected
ZIKF to identify the vector(s) transmitting.
METHODS
Clinical Presentations and Sample Collection
In Mexico-Guatemala border communities, physicians from Su-
chiate, Frontera Hidalgo, and Metapa municipalities reported to
the Centro Regional de Investigación en Salud Pública (CRISP),
in Tapachula, an increase of febrile patients with signs and symp-
toms perceived to be slightly different from those of CHIKF or
dengue. Therefore, a house-to-house survey was implemented
to identify patients who met the World Health Organization
case definition for ZIKF [18]: presentation with rash and/or
fever and at least 1 of the following signs or symptoms: arthralgia,
arthritis, or conjunctivitis (nonpurulent/hyperemic). Also, pa-
tients reporting directly to the CRISP for diagnostic assays and
meeting this case definition were included. Blood samples were
collected by venipuncture from acute and convalescent patients
who volunteered and provided written informed consent.
Detection of Viral RNA
RNA was extracted from serum samples collected 1–61 days
after fever onset, using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, California) following the manufacturer’s
protocol. All RNA samples were tested using a 1-step reverse
transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with the
Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California)
and previously described ZIKV- or DENV-specific primers
[19]. Quantitative RT-PCR was also performed, using the
Taqman
RNA-to-C
1-step
kit
(Applied
Biosystems,
San Francisco, California) and CHIKV-specific primers
[17]. All ZIKV-PCR-positive samples were confirmed using
end point real-time quantitative RT-PCR and previously
described primers 1086/1162c/1107-FAM [20] and were also
inoculated onto Vero cells for virus isolation attempts and pla-
que assays [21].
Serologic Testing
Because dengue fever is hyperendemic in the Tapachula region
and results in cross-reactions in ZIKV enzyme-linked immuno-
sorbent assays (ELISAs), sera were analyzed using the more-
specific plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) [21] for
ZIKV and the most recently circulating DENV-2 and DENV-3
serotypes. All samples negative for ZIKV and CHIKV RNA by
RT-PCR and negative for ZIKV antibodies by PRNT were also
screened by ELISA for CHIKV immunoglobulin M (IgM) [22]
(CHIKjj Detect IgM ELISA Kit; InBiOS, Seattle, Washington)
and DENV IgM (Detect IgM Capture ELISA; InBiOS).
ZIKV infection was confirmed if RNA was detected in a pa-
tient’s serum or if neutralizing antibodies were present in the
absence of DENV neutralization.
Mosquito Collections
From 9 to 17 December, adult mosquitoes were collected be-
tween 9:00 AM and 3:00 PM, using backpack aspirators, in and
around homes of patients with suspected ZIKF (Figure 1). Un-
engorged mosquitoes (ie, those with no visible blood in the ab-
domen) were pooled by species, sex, and date and location of
collection and then triturated in cell culture medium supple-
mented with 5% fetal bovine serum, using the Tissue Lyzer II
(Qiagen). Homogenates were centrifuged, and viral RNA was
extracted from supernatants, using the QIAamp Viral RNA
Mini Kit (Qiagen), and screened for the presence of ZIKV
RNA by RT-PCR as described above.
Virus isolation was performed by inoculation of Vero cells
(ATCC, Bethesda, Maryland) with 100 µL of mosquito homoge-
nates followed by incubation for up to 7 days for observation of
cytopathic effects (CPE). The supernatant from CPE-positive
cultures was harvested and reinoculated onto Vero cells for
viral amplification. RNA was extracted from CPE-positive super-
natants and sequenced using the Illumina 1500 HiSeq next-gen-
eration sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, California).
Illumina Sequencing
Viral RNA (approximately 0.9 µg) was fragmented by incubation
at 94°C for 8 minutes in 19.5 µL of buffer (Illumina 15016648).
Sequencing libraries were prepared using an Illumina TruSeq
RNA v2 kit and then sequenced using the Rapid-Run 2 × 50
paired-end protocol. Reads were quality filtered, and adapter se-
quences were removed using Trimmomatic software [24].The de
novo assembly program ABySS [25]was used to assemble contigs
covering nearly the full length of the ZIKV genome, using k val-
ues from 20–40 and 500 000 (MEX_1–7 and MEX_2–81) or
250 000 (MEX_1–44) reads. Reads were mapped back to the con-
tigs by using bowtie2 [26]and were visualized with the Integrated
Genomics Viewer [27] to verify correct assembly. There were
15.2, 14.1, and 13.5 million read pairs in samples MEX_1–7,

 MEX_1–44, and MEX_2–81, respectively, with approximately
32 300 (0.24%), 18 600 000 (13.3%), and 12 100 (0.09%), respec-
tively, mapping to the ZIKV genome.
Sequencing of PCR-Positive Serum Samples
Amplicons were generated from ZIKV-positive RNA extrac-
tions by RT-PCR (Superscript III RT System, Invitrogen, and
Phusion DNA polymerase; New England BioLabs, Ipswich,
Massachusetts) targeting the partial nonstructural protein 5
(NS5) gene. Direct Sanger sequencing of amplicons was per-
formed using the BigDye terminator v1.3 kit and ABI 3500 Ge-
netic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, California).
Alignments and analysis were performed using Sequencher
4.9 (Ann Arbor, Michigan).
The ZIKV evolutionary history was inferred by using the max-
imum likelihood method based on the general time reversible
model. The tree with the highest log likelihood (−31 884.9247)
is shown in Figure 2. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were
obtained using neighbor-joining and BioNJ algorithms, with
pair-wise distances estimated by using the maximum composite
likelihood (MCL) and then selecting the topology with the supe-
rior log likelihood value. A discrete gamma distribution was used
to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (5 categories
[+G, parameter, 0.2579]). The rate variation model allowed for
some sites to be evolutionarily invariable ([+I], 0.0010% sites).
All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated,
leaving 10 250 positions in the final data set. Evolutionary anal-
yses were conducted in MEGA7 [28].
RESULTS
Case Descriptions and RT-PCR Results
A total of 119 serum samples was collected in several locations
near Tapachula, Chiapas State, Mexico, between 30 November
and 18 December 2015 from patients with signs/symptoms
consistent with ZIKF (Tables 1 and 2); 70 (58.8%) were females,
and 49 (41.2%) were males, with ages ranging from 4 to 80 years
and a mean age of 34.7 years. Blood samples were also obtained
from convalescent patients in March 2016. Patient data were de-
identified, and laboratory testing was approved by the Univer-
sity of Texas Medical Branch Institutional Review Board.
All samples were analyzed for ZIKV RNA by RT-PCR, and
serological analyses were performed using PRNT and ELISA.
ZIKV RNA was detected in 25 sera (21%) collected 1–10 days
after signs/symptoms onset; 15 of these confirmed cases (60%)
were female (age range, 11–58 years; mean age, 26.3 years), and

 10 (40%) were male (age, 25–80 years; mean age, 42.6 years),
with an overall mean age of 33.1 years. A high proportion
(88%) of patients with PCR-confirmed ZIKV RNA presented
with a maculopapular rash, headache, and arthralgia (Table 2).
Fever and myalgia were also common (71%), and ocular signs
and symptoms (conjunctivitis and retroocular pain) were
observed in 38% of confirmed cases. Virus isolation on Vero
cells was negative for all sera. All samples negative for ZIKV
by RT-PCR also tested negative for DENV and CHIKV RNA.
Extrapolation of the cycle threshold values of PCR-positive
sera, using a standard curve generated from a closely related
ZIKV stock, yielded estimated viremia titers ranging from
0.32 to 2454 focus-forming units/mL from days 1 to 10 after
the onset of signs or symptoms (Figure 3).
Serology Results
As expected in a DENV-hyperendemic region, many sera were
positive in multiple flavivirus assays (Table 3 and Supplemental
Table 1). Of 74 patients (62.1%) with ZIKV-neutralizing antibod-
ies, all but 2 had some level of DENV neutralization, rendering
results inconclusive. Only 2 patients had ZIKV PRNT titers at
least 4-fold higher than DENV titers. Some patients showing
high ZIKV PRNT titers were also positive for DENV IgM,

 although no DENV RNA was detected. Of the 25 samples posi-
tive for ZIKV by PCR, only 8 had neutralizing activity against
ZIKV, consistent with clearance of ZIKV viremia by the antibody
response. Sera from convalescent patients were obtained for 19 of
25 ZIKF-confirmed (RT-PCR–positive) cases. A minimum 4-
fold increase in the ZIKV PRNT titer was observed in all of
these convalescent sera, consistent with ZIKV seroconversion
(Table 3). However, only 2 of these 19 convalescent patients
showed a 4-fold higher titer for ZIKV than for DENV, probably
reflecting prior DENV infection in the remaining 17 and an an-
amnestic increase in DENV PRNT titers due to original antigenic
sin [29]. Although no samples tested positive for CHIKV RNA,
CHIKV IgM was detected in 12 sera negative for ZIKV by PCR.
One ZIKV-negative patient tested positive for IgM against both
DENV and CHIKV.
Mosquito Screening
Mosquito collections were performed in 69 households, of
which 58 were from Tapachula and 11 were from Suchiate. A
total of 796 mosquitoes were collected, with A. aegypti being
the most abundant (59.3%; 59% female), followed by C. quin-
quefasciatus (40.5%; 47% female). Only 2 A. albopictus mosqui-
toes were captured (0.2%). At least 1 A. aegypti mosquito was
collected from most households (81.2%), but the densities of fe-
males per household were low (median 2.0; Table 4).
Of the 472 female A. aegypti tested in 55 pools, ZIKV RNA
was detected by RT-PCR in 15 pools. Three of these produced
CPE in Vero cells after 3 days of incubation, and virus isolates
were obtained. ZIKV was not detected in male mosquitoes, in-
cluding 52 pools of A. aegypti. The lack of virus isolation from
the RT-PCR–positive sera and most of the mosquito pools may
reflect low ZIKV titers, further reduced by repeated freezing and
thawing. ZIKV was not detected in any A. albopictus or C. quin-
quefasciatus mosquitoes. Despite the small numbers collected
in most households, the minimum field infection rate for
A. aegypti was estimated at 52.49–172.66 infections per 1000
mosquitoes (Table 3).
Sequencing and Phylogenetic Results
Three serum samples were selected from different locations for
direct Illumina and Sanger sequencing. Because of low genome
coverage, presumably reflecting low viral titers, no useful se-
quences were obtained using Illumina, but Sanger sequencing
generated partial ZIKV NS5 sequences. Full-genome sequences
were obtained using Illumina from RNA extracted directly from
the 3 mosquito pools from which ZIKV was isolated.
A phylogenetic analysis based on 44 complete genome se-
quences supported a ZIKV origin in Africa and divergence in
the distant past into 2 major lineages: African and Asian/Amer-
ican (Figure 2). African strains fell into 2 distinct groups: (1) the
Uganda cluster, anchored by the prototype 1947 MR766 strain
and including isolates from western Africa to 2001, and (2) the
Nigeria group, with strains isolated in Nigeria and Senegal from
1968–1997. The Asian lineage was anchored by the prototype
1966 P6-740 Malaysian strain and included all isolates from
Oceania. Within this Asian clade, the new American lineage
emerged, including strains from Latin America and the Carib-
bean. A major characteristic of the American lineage was its
rapid expansion to cover a widespread geographic area of trans-
mission, consistent with a pattern of intense diversification with
Table 2.

 expansion into new territories inhabited by immunologically
naive human populations.
Based on the occurrence of Mexican ZIKV strains in 2 inde-
pendent clades, the introduction of ZIKV into Chiapas probably
occurred twice; our strains from the Tapachula area probably re-
sulted from a point introduction from neighboring Guatemala,
likely following established migration routes (Figure 2). The
other 2 Mexican strains are from an unknown location in Chiapas
State (GenBank accession nos. KU922960.1 and KU922923.1),
and their grouping with a Martinique strain suggests an introduc-
tion from that Caribbean Island. Our NS5 sequences derived
from sera had no more than one nucleotide difference from the
mosquito strains, confirming a transmission link.
DISCUSSION
We detected an outbreak of ZIKF in southern Mexico, near the
Guatemalan border, from 30 November to 18 December 2015.
The 25 PCR-confirmed cases, collected 1–10 days after the
onset of signs and/or symptoms, suggested that viremia can last
for >10 days, assuming that it can precede clinical disease. The
majority of patients with ZIKF presented with rash, arthralgia,
headache, pruritus, myalgia, fever, chills, and somnolescence.
Other signs and symptoms reported previously [3], including
conjunctivitis and retro-orbital pain, occurred at lower frequen-
cies. No signs of neurologic disease, such as Guillain-Barré syn-
drome, were detected, and no pregnant female patients were
studied.
Serological results were inconclusive because nearly all patients
had DENV-neutralizing antibodies that presumably reflected
earlier DENV infections. This underscores the challenge of sero-
diagnostics in DENV-hyperendemic areas and emphasizes the
need for improved flavivirus antigens lacking cross-reactivity.
Although limited in scope, our study indicates that A. aegypti
was the principal vector of ZIKV in the Tapachula area of Chi-
apas State, based on the detection of ZIKV in several mosquito
pools and the previous demonstrated transmission competence
of this species [30, 31]. Our estimated field infection rates were
very high, as expected for viruses like DENV and CHIKV when
sampling is focused on the homes of suspected cases with active
transmission [32, 33]. An important finding was that ZIKV was
not detected in C. quinquefasciatus, another common urban
tropical mosquito discussed as a potential ZIKV vector [9].

 Only 2 A. albopictus mosquitoes, another proven ZIKV vector
[4, 31, 34], were collected, so the lack of infection of this species
is not conclusive regarding its potential role in other regions
where it is more abundant.
Our implication of A. aegypti in ZIKV transmission in south-
ern Mexico is important because no natural mosquito infections
have been reported in the peer-reviewed literature since ZIKV
reached the Americas, and some experimental studies suggest
that this species develops disseminated infections at a low fre-
quency even after high-titer blood meals [31]. However, based
on its nearly ideal anthropophilic behavior, this species can
transmit human viruses to epidemic proportions even when it
is relatively insusceptible [35]. Our first conclusive implication
of this species in ZIKV transmission in the Americas, based on
the detection of virus identical or nearly so to strains from hu-
mans living in the same households, supports the need for
additional efforts to control A. aegypti as one of the few inter-
ventions currently available for the ongoing outbreak.
Our phylogenetic results suggest that the Tapachula outbreak
occurred following a point source ZIKV introduction from
Guatemala. However, our Chiapas isolates were phylogenetically
distinct from 2 other strains isolated from human infections in
the same state, which were probably introduced directly from
the Caribbean island of Martinique. The ability of infected people
to transport ZIKV, perhaps even when asymptomatically infected
or during incubation, to initiate mosquito-borne transmission is
undoubtedly a major factor in its explosive spread from French
Polynesia since 2013. This ability, combined by transmission by
A. aegypti, as indicated by our results, suggests a poor prognosis
for controlling the current ZIKF outbreak in the Americas. Con-
sidering the ongoing CHIKF outbreak, which followed a similar
pathway to the Americas in 2013, followed by an epidemic of
hemispheric proportions [36], as well as our inability to control
DENV in the Americas for many decades, the prospects for con-
trolling or slowing the spread of ZIKV are poor. Nevertheless,
source reduction and insecticide-based control inside and around
homes, schools, and places of work should be redoubled and sup-
plemented by more-recently developed methods, such as lethal
traps, until transgenic and Wolbachia-based methods can be
scaled-up for use in large populations [37]. Fortunately, the
majority of ZIKF cases are mild or unapparent, and the overall
global disease burden is smaller than that of CHIKV and
DENV. However, the high risk of severe ZIKV outcomes such
as microcephaly following infection during pregnancy [5, 38] in-
dicate a need for extraordinary measures to protect pregnant
women and their sex partners from exposure to A. aegypti and
perhaps other vectors during the peak of ZIKV transmission oc-
curring now in many regions of the Americas.
