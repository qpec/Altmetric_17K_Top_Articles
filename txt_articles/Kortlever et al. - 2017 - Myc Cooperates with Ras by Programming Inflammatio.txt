SUMMARY
The two oncogenes KRas and Myc cooperate to
drive tumorigenesis, but the mechanism underlying
this remains unclear. In a mouse lung model of
KRasG12D-driven adenomas, we find that co-activa-
tion of Myc drives the immediate transition to highly
proliferative and invasive adenocarcinomas marked
by highly inflammatory, angiogenic, and immune-
suppressed stroma. We identify epithelial-derived
signaling
molecules
CCL9
and
IL-23
as
the
principal instructing signals for stromal reprogram-
ming. CCL9 mediates recruitment of macrophages,
angiogenesis, and PD-L1-dependent expulsion of
T and B cells. IL-23 orchestrates exclusion of
adaptive T and B cells and innate immune NK cells.
Co-blockade of both CCL9 and IL-23 abrogates
Myc-induced
tumor
progression.
Subsequent
deactivation of Myc in established adenocarcinomas
triggers immediate reversal of all stromal changes
and tumor regression, which are independent of
CD4+CD8+ T cells but substantially dependent on
returning NK cells. We show that Myc extensively
programs an immune suppressive stroma that is
obligatory for tumor progression.
INTRODUCTION
The 1983 discovery of oncogenic cooperation between acti-
vated Ras and Myc (Land et al., 1983) demonstrated the obligate
interdependence of individual oncogenic mutations. However,
30 years on, the mechanisms underlying Ras/Myc cooperation
remain elusive. Early studies focused solely on Ras and Myc’s
complementary cell-intrinsic outputs, such as their co-induction
and/or stabilization of cell cycle proteins (Born et al., 1994; Leone
et al., 1997; Wang et al., 2011) and Myc itself (Sears et al., 2000),
on the reciprocal abrogation of Ras-induced senescence by
Myc (Evan and Littlewood, 1998; Vaque
´ et al., 2005) and Ras-
dependent suppression of Myc-induced apoptosis (Evan and
Littlewood, 1998; Tsuneoka and Mekada, 2000), or on the
capacity of Myc to overcome blockade to self-renewal in Ras-
driven cells (Dong et al., 2011; Ischenko et al., 2013). However,
co-transgenic in vivo studies in mice demonstrated that onco-
genic cooperation between Ras and Myc in diverse tissues
(Alexander et al., 1989; Andres et al., 1988; Boxer et al., 2004;
Compere et al., 1989; Podsypanina et al., 2008; Tran et al.,
2008; Yaari et al., 2005) necessarily involves modulation of
interactions between the tumor cells and their stroma.
Both Ras and Myc are implicated in human non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC). Oncogenic KRas mutations are thought
to be causal drivers in �30% of NSCLC, especially in smokers
(Rodenhuis et al., 1988), and correlate with poor prognosis
(Graziano et al., 1999). Mutant KRas is principally thought to
drive precocious mitogenic signaling but is also credited with
reprogramming tumor cell metabolism (Kimmelman, 2015),
suppressing apoptosis (Cox and Der, 2003; Kauffmann-Zeh
et al., 1997) and promoting migration, metastasis (Campbell
and
Der,
2004),
angiogenesis
(Kranenburg
et
al.,
2004;
Sparmann and Bar-Sagi, 2004), and inflammation (Karin,
2005)—the latter two presumably by indirect signaling, since
oncogenic Ras is confined to the epithelial tumor cell compart-
ment. Indeed, oncogenic KRas is a potent inducer of various
cytokines in many tumor types, including lung, where IL-8
(CXCL8) and IL-6 both contribute to lung cancer’s signature
inflammatory phenotype (Ancrile et al., 2008; Campbell and
Der, 2004; Ji et al., 2006; Kranenburg et al., 2004; Sparmann
and Bar-Sagi, 2004; Sunaga et al., 2012). Aberrant Myc expres-
sion is also implicated in lung cancer. It is demonstrably over-
expressed in >70% of NSCLC (Richardson and Johnson,
1993), with overt Myc gene amplification in the �20% of tumors
with poorest prognosis (Iwakawa et al., 2011; Seo et al., 2014;
Wolfer et al., 2010). Precocious Myc activity is causally impli-
cated in cancers principally through its capacity to drive tumor
cell proliferation; engage biosynthetic cell metabolism; and
promote angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis (Dang, 2013;
Rapp et al., 2009; Shchors et al., 2006; Sodir et al., 2011;
Wolfer et al., 2010). Even in NSCLC not overtly driven by
mutations in Ras or Myc themselves, endogenous Ras and
Myc both play prominent, even obligate, roles as downstream
conduits for diverse upstream oncogenic drivers.

 Here, we specifically explore the cooperative contribution
made by Myc deregulation to the evolution and progression of
KRasG12D-driven lung tumors in vivo. Using a rapidly and revers-
ibly switchable genetic system (Murphy et al., 2008), we define
the causal sequence of events by which Myc drives conversion
of indolent adenomas to aggressive, inflammatory, and im-
mune-suppressed adenocarcinomas and by which subsequent
Myc de-activation triggers tumor regression. Our data show a
profound role for Myc in re-programming the tumor microenvi-
ronment—especially the inflammatory and immune components
of tumor stroma.
RESULTS
Myc Deregulation, without Elevated Expression,
Cooperates with KRasG12D to Accelerate Lung
Tumorigenesis In Vivo
To investigate Myc cooperation with KRasG12D in vivo, we used
mice heterozygous for the LSL-KRasG12D allele (Jackson et al.,
2001) and homozygous for Rosa26-lox-STOP-lox MycERT2
(R26LSLMycERT2) (Murphy et al., 2008). In these LSL-KRasG12D;
Rosa26-lox-STOP-lox MycERT2 mice (hereafter referred to as
KM), inhalation of Cre-recombinase-expressing adenovirus
(AdV) triggers sporadic coincident expression in lung of onco-
genic KRasG12D from its endogenous promoter and reversibly
activatable 4-OHT-dependent MycERT2 driven from the consti-
tutively active Rosa26 promoter at low, quasi-physiological
levels (Murphy et al., 2008).
As reported (Jackson et al., 2001), activation of endogenous
KRasG12D alone in lung epithelium elicits slow outgrowth of mul-
tiple independent lesions. Multiple small foci of atypical epithelial
and adenomatous hyperplasia are evident by 6 weeks after
AdV-Cre inhalation, progressing to indolent and non-invasive
adenomas by 12–18 weeks. Aggressive and invasive adenocar-
cinomas emerge sporadically much later, presumably through
additional oncogenic lesions. Activation of MycERT2 (for 6 weeks)
in 12-week-old indolent KRasG12D-driven lesions dramatically
accelerated tumorigenesis over that in KRasG12D-only controls
(Figures 1A, S1A, S2A, and S2B), resulting in highly proliferative,
invasive tumors heavily infiltrated with leukocytes and with
inchoate, nascent vasculature indicative of ongoing angiogen-
esis (Figures 1B–1D). Myc activation profoundly accelerated
lung tumor progression at every stage of adenoma evolution
(Figures S2A and S2B), triggering a precipitous drop in survival
(Figure S2C). Activation of MycERT2 in the absence of KRasG12D
elicited no discernible lung phenotype (Figure S2D), while
tamoxifen treatment alone had no effect on KRasG12D-only
lung tumors (not shown). The aggressive phenotypes of
KRasG12D tumors following MycERT2 activation were indistin-
guishable from those of KRasG12D tumors driven by constitutive
Rosa26-driven Myc (not shown).
Myc Deregulation in Tumor Cells Rapidly Induces
Diverse Stromal Changes
The lung tumors resulting from long-term combined KRasG12D
and Myc activity are more advanced and aggressive than the
indolent tumors driven by KRasG12D alone, being markedly
more proliferative, invasive, inflammatory, and angiogenic.
Such dramatic stromal changes could either be indirect, passive
consequences of the disruption of normal lung architecture
caused by Myc-driven tumor growth or, alternatively, direct
proximal consequences of Myc activation within the adenoma
epithelial compartment. Hence, to determine how Myc activation
causally elicits its diverse phenotypic changes, we used the
rapid, synchronous, and reversible in vivo activation possible
with MycERT2 (Pelengaris et al., 2002; Shchors et al., 2006; Sodir
et al., 2011). Matched cohorts of adult KM mice were infected
with AdV-Cre, and 12 weeks later, tamoxifen was systemically
administered to activate Myc in the epithelial cells of the incipient
lung adenomas (Figure S1B). Myc activation triggered prolifera-
tion broadly across the whole adenoma mass (Figure 2A), as well
as immediate and widespread changes in the tumor-associated
stroma. Within 24 hr of Myc activation, we saw a dramatic influx
of CD206+ macrophages (Figure 2B) into tumor masses and
concurrent loss of CD3+ T (Figure 2B) and B220+ B cells (Fig-
ure S3A). We also saw a rapid decline of NKp46+ natural killer
(NK) cells (Figure 2B) from the juxta-tumoral blood vessels and
tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) to which they principally
localize (Fridman et al., 2012; Goc et al., 2013; Joshi et al.,
2015) and a fall in total NK cell numbers in the entire lungs (Fig-
ure S3B). This rapid expulsion of NK cells is especially intriguing
given that Myc activation also triggered a profound upregulation
of Rae-1 NKG2D ligands and downregulation of major histocom-
patibility complex (MHC) class I (Figure S3C)—both potent acti-
vating signals for NK-like cells (Morvan and Lanier, 2016)—in
lung adenoma cells. Finally, Myc activation triggered the
abrupt onset of angiogenesis, marked by loss of vessel integrity,
increased vessel leakiness, and relief of the widespread hypoxia
characteristic of the original indolent adenomas (Figures 2C and
S3D). All of these diverse changes in tumor and stroma preceded
overt Myc-induced tumor expansion, and all were sustained so
long as Myc activity was maintained (see below).
Myc-Induced Stromal Changes in Lung Tumors Are
Instructed by CCL9 and IL-23
To exclude the possibility that some of the phenotype we
observe might be a consequence of Cre induction of MycERT2
in long-lived resident alveolar macrophages we directly as-
sessed whether MycERT2 is expressed in the lung tumor-associ-
ated macrophages using two independent macrophage markers
co-expressed on lung tumor-associated macrophages (Fig-
ure S3E)—the mannose receptor CD206 and EMR1, a GPCR
family adhesion molecule recognized by the F4/80 antibody.
First, we showed that abundant nuclear in situ MycERT2 RNA
signals, while evident across the entire adenoma epithelial
compartment of KM mice, are entirely absent from all CD206+
macrophages (Figure S3F). Second, analysis of lung macro-
phages harvested from disaggregated KM mouse lungs and
purified by F4/80 antibody affinity showed complete absence
of MycERT2 mRNA expression, all of which was confined to the
F4/80 negative lung cell fraction (Figure S3G). Hence, none of
the stromal changes we observe are the result of direct activation
of MycERT2 in macrophages.
As MycERT2 is activated only in the epithelial compartment of
the KM lung adenomas, the rapid stromal changes that Myc
elicits must be mediated by signals released from those epithelial

 cells. To identify them, we activated MycERT2 in adenoma-
bearing KM mice, harvested their lungs after 8 hr, and used
whole-lung protein extracts to interrogate an inflammation anti-
body array. Of 40 potential candidates, only two inflammatory
signals were detectably upregulated by Myc: the chemokine
CCL9 (a.k.a. MIP-1g) and the p40 subunit common to IL-12
and IL-23 (Figures 3A and 3B). This upregulation was confirmed
immunohistochemically: by 3 days post Myc activation, intense
cytoplasmic CCL9 immunostaining and cell surface immuno-
staining for the p19 subunit of IL-23 were evident (Figure S4A)
in TTF1+ epithelial cells (Stenhouse et al., 2004) while absent
from both non-tamoxifen-treated controls (Figure S4B) and
tamoxifen-treated
KRasG12D-only-driven
adenomas
(not
shown). The extremely rapid induction of both CCL9 and IL-23
following epithelial Myc activation, plus their histological co-
localization, confirm the adenoma epithelial compartment as
the source of CCL9 and IL-23 production and secretion.
To determine whether CCL9 and IL-23 release is the proximal
trigger for the stromal changes that Myc activation elicits,
adenoma-bearing KM mice were pre-treated with CCL9- and/
or IL-23-blocking antibodies and Myc then activated by
tamoxifen administration (Figures S1C and S1D). Co-blockade
of both CCL9 and IL-23 sharply reduced Myc-induced macro-
phage influx; blocked the Myc-induced angiogenic switch; and
forestalled the loss of T, B, and NK cells (Figures 3C and S4C).
And while Myc-induced tumor cell proliferation was only
modestly suppressed, it was now accompanied by significant
tumor cell apoptosis (Figure 3C), resulting in significant reduction
in tumor burden by 7 days’ blockade (Figures 3D and 3E). To
define the individual roles of CCL9 and IL-23 in mediating Myc-
induced stromal changes, we used antibodies to inhibit each
signal individually. Blockade of IL-23 had no discernible impact
on either Myc-induced macrophage influx or angiogenesis but
profoundly blocked Myc-induced loss of T, B, and NK cells;
weakly suppressed tumor cell proliferation; and potently exacer-
bated tumor cell apoptosis (Figure 3C). By contrast, blockade of
CCL9 alone profoundly inhibited Myc-induced macrophage
influx, angiogenesis, and T cell loss but had no impact on
Myc-driven NK cell exclusion, weakly inhibited B cell loss, and
only modestly inhibited tumor cell proliferation or exacerbated
apoptosis (Figure 3C).
To dissect further the causal sequence by which CCL9 and
IL-23 modify lung tumor stroma, we next examined the mecha-
nism behind Myc-induced angiogenesis. The rapid remodeling
of tumor vasculature that Myc triggers is a prototypical effect
of VEGF, and indeed, immunohistochemistry using the GVM39
monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes VEGF bound
to its cognate VEGFR2 receptor (Brekken et al., 1998) indicated
rapid VEGF engagement of endothelial cell VEGFR2 following
Myc activation (Figure 4A). To identify the source of VEGF, we
assayed VEGFA expression
in F4/80-affinity-isolated
lung
macrophages, since macrophages are established drivers of
angiogenesis in diverse tumors (Pollard, 2004). VEGFA mRNA
expression was evident in the F4/80+ cell fraction of tamoxifen-
treated KM lungs (Figure 4B), but only after MycERT2 activation.
By contrast, expression of PD-L1, constitutive in F4/80+ KM lung
macrophages (Igarashi et al., 2016), was unaffected by Myc
activation status (Figure 4B). Together with our observation
that Myc-driven KM lung tumor angiogenesis is completely
absent
when
macrophage
influx
is
abrogated
by
CCL9
blockade, our data identify macrophage-derived VEGF as the
principal instigator of Myc-induced lung adenoma angiogenesis.
Since CCL9 blockade prevented Myc-induced loss of T cells
from KM adenomas, we hypothesized that incoming macro-
phages might mediate T cell exclusion. Immunostaining showed
PD-L1 expression on lung macrophages but absent from the
adenoma epithelium, irrespective of Myc status (Figure 4C). After
Myc activation, F4/80+ PD-L1+ macrophages rapidly accumu-
lated in the tumors (Figure 4D), coinciding temporally with loss
of CD3+ T cells (see Figure 2B). To test directly whether accumu-
lation of PD-L1-positive macrophages was causally responsible
for the T cell loss, we activated MycERT2 in adenoma-bearing
KM mice while concurrently administering PD-L1-blocking
immunoglobulin (Figure S1E). PD-L1 blockade completely abol-
ished Myc-induced T cell loss and partially suppressed B cell
loss but had no discernible impact on Myc-induced macrophage
influx, angiogenesis, or the rapid decline in juxta-tumoral NK
cells (Figure 4E). Moreover, PD-L1 blockade—and consequent

NK cells cluster principally in juxta-tumoral tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs), and/or adjacent to large tumor-associated blood vessels (V) and airways (A).
Hence, quantitation of NK cells includes both tumor area and tumor-associated vasculature and TLSs. For NK cell staining (NKp46), lung regions with multiple

 persistence of T cells—had no measurable inhibitory impact on
tumor cell proliferation (Figure 4E), tumor growth, or tumor
burden (Figure 4F).
Taken together, our data delineate a causal sequence
whereby Myc activation in lung epithelial adenoma cells triggers
rapid release of IL-23 and CCL9. IL-23 drives the rapid exit of T,
B, and NK cells, and since IL-23 blockade triggers tumor cell
apoptosis, we infer its activity is required for outgrowth of
Myc-driven lung adenocarcinomas. CCL9 is principally respon-
sible for the rapid recruitment of PD-L1+ macrophages into the
tumor environment whose rapid induction and release of VEGF
drives the CCL9-dependent angiogenic switch while the PD-L1
they express is, along with IL-23, required for the rapid loss of
T, but not of NK, cells.
Lung Tumors, and Their Associated Stroma, Rapidly
Acquire Dependency upon Myc Activity for Their
Maintenance
Previous transgenic studies of tumors co-driven by oncogenic
Ras and Myc concur that such tumors are dependent on both
oncogenes for their maintenance. Acquisition of such depen-
dence, sometimes dubbed ‘‘oncogene addiction,’’ is a widely
reported phenomenon, although its underlying mechanistic
basis remains unknown.
To address whether KRasG12D-driven lung tumors acquire de-
pendency on Myc, we activated MycERT2 in adenoma-bearing
KM mice for 6 weeks and then de-activated it by tamoxifen
withdrawal (Figure S1F) (Wilson et al., 2014). Myc de-activation
triggered an immediate drop in tumor cell proliferation, rapid
exit of macrophages and re-entry of CD3+ T cells, an influx of
NKp46+ NK cells, and induction of tumor apoptosis (Figure 5A)
and tumor regression, evident by the appearance of voids within
the tumor masses and profound drop in overall tumor burden
(Figure 5B). Concurrently, tumor blood vessels ‘‘normalized’’
(Figure 5C) and hypoxia rose (Figure S5).
To ascertain how rapidly Myc dependency arises, Myc was
activated in adenoma-bearing KM mice for 7 days—sufficient
time to induce all stromal changes and for significant increase
in tumor load (Figures 6A and S1G). De-activating Myc, even
after this short period of Myc activity, triggered an immediate
drop in tumor cell proliferation, rapid efflux of macrophages,
normalization of vasculature, and repopulation by T and NK cells
(Figures 6B and 6C). Hence, the dependency of KRasG12D-driven
lung adenocarcinomas on deregulated Myc activity arises imme-
diately across the whole tumor mass and across all tumors. Of
note, however, Myc de-activation failed to drive complete tumor
regression; rather, the tumors regressed back to their previously
indolent KRasG12D-only adenoma state and thereafter persisted
indefinitely (Figures 6D and S1H).
The tight temporal coincidence between tumor cell apoptosis
and re-entry of T and NK cells (Figure 6B) prompted us to address
whether T or NK cells play a causal role in Myc-de-activation-
induced tumor regression. To investigate this, we depleted KM
mice of either CD4+ helper and CD8+ effector T cells or NK cells
using appropriate antibodies (Figure S1I). Systemic anti-CD4/
CD8 treatment efficiently ablated all detectable circulating
and splenic T cells (Figure 7A) and completely abrogated the re-
population of tumors by CD3+ T cells following Myc de-activation
(Figure 7B). However, absence of CD4+/CD8+ T cells had no
measurable inhibitory effect on induction of tumor apoptosis
(Figure 7C), nor did it inhibit macrophage efflux or influx of NK
cells (Figure S6A). By contrast, systemic depletion of NKp46+
NK cells using asiolo-GM1 antibody (Figures 7A and 7B), while
having no impact on Myc deactivation-induced T cell influx
(Figure S6B), profoundly inhibited both efflux of macrophages
(Figure S6B) and induction of the apoptosis responsible for tumor
regression (Figure 7C).
DISCUSSION
To address the mechanism and dynamics of cooperation be-
tween oncogenic KRasG12D and Myc in discrete tissues in vivo,
we
used
KM
mice
that
combine
the
well-characterized
LSL-KRasG12D mouse lung tumor model (Jackson et al., 2001)
with our Rosa26-LSL-MycERT2 mouse (Murphy et al., 2008).
Inhalation by KM mice of AdV-Cre sporadically co-induces
expression of both oncogenic KRasG12D and tamoxifen-switch-
able MycERT2 in bronchioalveolar epithelium; in the resulting
adenomas, oncogenic KRasG12D activity is expressed constitu-
tively while Myc activity may be reversibly superimposed at
will. Adeno-Cre activation of KRasG12D alone initiates formation
of sporadic dysplasias that slowly progress to indolent ade-
nomas and only rarely and sporadically evolve into aggressive
adenocarcinomas. Activation of Myc alone had no observable
effect on lung tissues. By contrast, sustained co-activation of
Myc drove dramatic progression into highly proliferative, inva-
sive, angiogenic, inflammatory, and lethal adenocarcinomas.
Long-term Myc activation studies provide little mechanistic
cause-and-effect information as to how Myc deregulation drives
progression of indolent KRasG12D-driven adenomas into aggres-
sive adenocarcinomas. In particular, whether the profound
stromal changes that Myc elicits are direct consequences of

 Myc programming or chronic host tissue responses to intrusion
by the tumor is unclear. To distinguish between these two possi-
bilities, we used the remarkably synchronous and rapid in vivo
Myc activation afforded by the MycERT2 switchable system
(Christophorou et al., 2005; Littlewood et al., 1995; Pelengaris
et al., 2002; Shchors et al., 2006; Wilson et al., 2014) to delineate
the temporal sequence of events by which Myc activation drives
transition to adenocarcinoma.
Acute MycERT2 activation in indolent KRasG12D-driven lung
adenomas rapidly reprogrammed both hematopoietic and endo-
thelial stromal compartments, driving rapid influx of CD206+
macrophages prototypically associated with tissue remodeling
and immune regulation in diverse tissues (Martinez and Gordon,
2014; R}
oszer, 2015) including lung (Aggarwal et al., 2014); rapid
loss of T, B, and NK cells; and vasculature remodeling coincident
with transition from localized hypoxia to normoxia. These diverse
stromal changes preceded any significant expansion of the
tumor masses. Hence, the signature ‘‘stromatype’’ of the
aggressive adenocarcinomas induced by sustained co-activity
of KRasG12D and Myc is an immediate, instructed consequence
of Myc activation, not an indirect or generic tissue reaction to
disruption by the expanding tumor in its midst.
Since MycERT2 is activated only in the epithelial compartment
of KM adenomas, the consequent stromal changes must be
mediated by signals originating in that epithelium. A broad
search identified only two candidates, CCL9 and IL-23, as
induced in lung adenomas with sufficient rapidity (by 8 hr) to
be proximal causes of the Myc-induced stromal changes we
observe. Both immunohistochemically localized to the TTF1+
epithelial compartment. CCL9, a.k.a. MIP-1g, is a murine ligand
for the CCR1/CD191 receptor present on monocytes, T cells,
and some immature CD34+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells
(MDSCs). It is a potent chemo-attractant for monocytes, macro-
phages, and MDSCs (White et al., 2013), while CCR1 ligation is
implicated in progression of adenomas to carcinomas (Kitamura
et al., 2007; Koizumi et al., 2007) and inflammatory lung pathol-
ogies (Kitamura et al., 2015). IL-23 is a pro-inflammatory cyto-
kine that suppresses wound resolution and is pro-tumorigenic
in many tissues (Langowski et al., 2006), including lung (Baird
et al., 2013). IL-23 is the principal trigger of TH17 lymphocytes,
an ROR1g-dependent T cell subset whose consequent secretion
of IL-17 and IL-22 induces, in turn, production of diverse inflam-
matory cytokines, chemokines, and prostaglandins by many
stromal cell types (Gaffen et al., 2014). TH17 cells are also highly
immunosuppressive (Bailey et al., 2014; Chang, 2015; Chang
et al., 2014). IL-23 is also a potent suppressor of innate immunity,
most notably NK cells (Teng et al., 2010). IL-23 shares a common
p40 subunit with IL-12 that, in many ways, antagonizes IL-23 in
cancers by boosting anti-tumor immunity (Ngiow et al., 2013;
Teng et al., 2012) and promoting injury resolution and subse-
quent tissue re-normalization (Ngiow et al., 2013).
Co-blockade of both CCL9 and IL-23 profoundly inhibited all
the diverse stromal changes that Myc elicits, suppressed
Myc-induced tumor cell proliferation, and triggered abrupt onset
of apoptosis. Blockade of CCL9 alone had little impact on tumor
cell
proliferation
or
apoptosis
but
completely
inhibited
Myc-induced macrophage influx, angiogenesis, and T cell loss.
It also reduced loss of B cells yet had no inhibitory impact on
Myc-driven loss of juxta-tumoral NK cells. By contrast, blockade
of IL-23 alone had no inhibitory impact on macrophage influx or
angiogenesis but strongly suppressed T cell loss, completely
blocked the loss of NK and B cells, mildly suppressed tumor
cell proliferation, and unlike blockade of CCL9 alone, triggered
widespread tumor cell apoptosis. From these studies, we draw
several conclusions (Figure S7). First, CCL9 and IL-23 are the
principal epithelial signals that instruct the immediate and
diverse stromal changes that Myc elicits. Second, while both
CCL9 and IL-23 are crucial for the rapid loss of T and B cells
following Myc activation, CCL9 alone is required to drive macro-
phage recruitment and angiogenesis, while IL-23 alone is
required for rapid exclusion of NK cells. Third, since blockade
of IL-23, but not CCL9, triggers substantial tumor cell apoptosis,
IL-23 plays a unique role in survival and maintenance of
Myc-driven lung tumors.
Myc activation rapidly induced a profound angiogenic switch,
evident by blood vessel permeability and loss of integrity that
coincided with VEGF activity. VEGF was potently induced in
the macrophage compartment following Myc activation, impli-
cating macrophages as the principal angiogenic mediators,
consistent with the inhibition of Myc-induced angiogenesis by
CCL9 blockade and the widely reported angiogenic role of mac-
rophages (Chanmee et al., 2014; Riabov et al., 2014) (Figure S7).
In exploring the mechanism underlying the peculiar obligate role
of CCL9 in Myc-driven exclusion of T and B cells, but not NK
cells, we noted the rapid rise in the lung tumors of cells express-
ing the immunosuppressive ligand PD-L1 (a.k.a. B7-H1 or
CD274) following Myc activation. However, PD-L1 expression
was not directly induced by Myc, as recently reported (Casey

Acute Myc de-activation in established

rapid
and synchronous regression of all tumors,

Myc-induced stromal changes: macro-
phages rapidly exited the tumor masses;

and

hypoxia
reappeared;
T, B, and NK cells rapidly repopulated the tumors and their envi-
rons; and tumor cell apoptosis and tumor regression rapidly
ensued. Remarkably, even very short-term (7 days) activation
of ectopic Myc was sufficient to establish such Myc dependency
in tumors. Acquired dependency on driver oncogenes (onco-
gene addiction) is a pervasive phenomenon that provides the
underpinning rationale for most current targeted therapies. Its
mechanism remains unclear, although co-dependency of onco-
genic mutations, the abrupt re-instatement of cell intrinsic or

 immune checkpoints, asynchrony in attenuation rates of mito-
genic versus survival signals, and collapse of tumor stroma
have all been implicated (Restifo, 2010; Sharma et al., 2006;
Sodir et al., 2011; Tran et al., 2011). Intriguingly, once the
Myc-driven KM tumors had regressed back to their previous
KRasG12D-only adenoma state and size, tumor regression
stalled indefinitely. Similarly incomplete regression upon Myc
de-activation has been seen in other Myc transgenic models
(Boxer et al., 2004; Podsypanina et al., 2008; Tran et al., 2008).
It contrasts with the complete regression—indeed, eradica-
tion—seen upon inhibition of Myc in KRasG12D-driven lung

apparent
discrepancy that likely arises because
Omomyc inhibits not only Myc trans-
genes, but also endogenous Myc. The
rapidity with which Myc dependency
arises is incompatible with the idea that Myc addiction reflects
acquired co-dependency upon other oncogenic mutations.
Rather, our data favor a tight temporal and spatial co-depen-
dence between Myc driven tumor cell expansion and Myc-driven
tumor stroma. However, precisely which attributes of the
Myc-instructed tumor stroma are so essential for tumor mainte-
nance are less clear. T cells do not appear to be involved, since
abrogation of Myc-driven T cell expulsion by PD-L1 blockade
has no inhibitory impact on Myc-driven lung tumor growth, pro-
gression, or burden. Moreover, while systemic depletion of CD4+
and CD8+ T cells prevented T cell re-colonization of tumors

 following Myc de-activation, it does not measurably retard either
stromal collapse or tumor regression. By contrast, our data do
suggest a possible role for NK cells in limiting KM tumor growth.
Myc rapidly induced expression of Rae-1, the principal acti-
vating ligands for the NK cell NKG2D receptor, in adenoma
epithelial cells. It also downregulated MHC class I, a potent
trigger of NK cell activation as well as a means of adaptive
T cell evasion (To
¨ pfer et al., 2011). Given two such potent
NK cell activators, it is difficult to see how KM tumors could
survive without the rapid clearance of NK cells that IL-23 medi-
ates. Indeed, blockade of IL-23 in Myc-stimulated KM tumors
triggered profound tumor apoptosis that was not seen when
expulsion of T cells alone was blocked by PD-L1 blockade. We
also note that the transient wave of apoptosis (Figure 6C)
responsible for regression of KM tumors induced by Myc deac-
tivation precisely coincides temporally with transient influx of NK
cells and is significantly suppressed when NK cells, but not
CD4+CD8+ T cells, are systemically ablated.
Advantageous though it may be for tumors, the question
remains as to why Myc is bestowed with the capacity to drive
rapid clearance of adaptive and innate lymphocytes cells, a
property of Myc we see across diverse tissues. We guess the
answer lies in the physiological role of Myc as the transcriptional
coordinator of the diverse array of intra- and extracellular pro-
cesses needed for regeneration in lung (Dong et al., 2011) and
other tissues after injury. Such regeneration requires complex,
tissue-specific interplay between epithelial, myeloid, mesen-
chymal, and endothelial stromal elements needed to clear
debris, seal the wound, and regenerate the tissue. In sterile situ-
ations (where pathogens are no complication), this rapid
outgrowth phase is typically associated with rapid influx of
immunosuppressive monocytic and myeloid-derived suppres-
sor cells (Wynn and Vannella, 2016) followed by a resolution
phase marked by return of lymphoid cells (D’Alessio et al.,
2009; Wu et al., 2013) during which epithelial regeneration
attenuates and extensive tissue and vascular remodeling recon-
struct the original tissue architecture. The similarities between
this biphasic physiological process, regeneration followed by
resolution, and Myc-driven tumorigenesis followed by Myc
de-activation-induced tumor regression, are provocative.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Mice and in vivo procedures
All treatments and procedures of mice were conducted in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee at UCSF and Home Office UK guidelines under project licenses to G.I.E., (70/7586, 80/2396) at the University of
Cambridge. Mice were maintained on regular diet in a pathogen-free facility on a 12 hr light/dark cycle with continuous access to
food and water. Lsl-KrasG12D (Jackson et al., 2001) and LSL-Rosa26MIE/MIE (Murphy et al., 2008) mice have been described previ-
ously. For activation of MycERT2, Tamoxifen (Sigma; T5648) dissolved in peanut oil was administered daily by intraperitoneal (IP)
injection for a maximum of 6 weeks at a dose of 1 mg/20 g body mass. To deliver adenovirus-Cre recombinase (AdV-Cre), mice
were anesthetized with 2.5% Avertin (250 ml/20 g body mass) or isoflurane (Zoetis, IsoFlo 250 ml) and 5x107 plaque-forming units
of AdV-Cre were administered as described previously (Fasbender et al., 1998). Mice were between 8 and 12 weeks old at time of
AdV-Cre infection, and between 20-28 weeks of age at time of euthanasia and analysis. Equivalent female and male age-matched
littermates were divided over experimental and control mice. Lectins were administered by retro-orbital injection prior to sacrifice and
Hypoxyprobe and blocking antibodies for PD-L1, IL23p19, CCL9, CD4, CD8 and asialo-GM1 were administered by IP injection at
doses and frequency described in method details and Figure S1.
METHOD DETAILS
Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence
Mice were euthanized and cardiac-perfused with PBS followed by 10% neutral-buffered formalin (Sigma-Aldrich, 501320). Lungs
were removed, fixed overnight in neutral-buffered formalin and processed for paraffin embedding. Tissue sections were stained
with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) using standard reagents and protocols. For frozen sections, lungs were directly embedded in
OCT (VWR Chemicals, 361603E) and either frozen on dry ice or snap frozen in liquid Nitrogen, embedded in OCT, and stored at
�80�C. For immunofluorescence analysis of VEGF bound to its receptor (VEGF:VEGFR2), OCT frozen cryostat-cut 10 mm sections
were air-dried, serum blocked and incubated with the GV39M antibody overnight. For immunohistochemical and immunofluores-
cence analysis, sections were de-paraffinized, rehydrated, and boiled in a microwave for 10 minutes in 10 mM citrate buffer
(pH 6.0) or treated with 20 mg/ml Proteinase K for antigen retrieval. Antibodies were incubated overnight at 4�C except for anti-CD3,

 which was incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature. Antibodies used (see key resources table): F4/80 (Cl:A3-1); MMR/CD206;
CD45 (30-F11); CD3 (SP7); CD274/PD-L1; Ki67 (SP6); c-Myc (Y69); CD31/PECAM (MEC13.3); Pan-endothelial cell antigen/PVLAP
(MECA32); IL23p19; CCL9/10/MIP1g; TTF1 (EP1584Y); TTF1 (8G7G3/1); Hypoxyprobe (4.3.11.3); Pan-Rae-1; MHC1 (ER-HR52);
CD45R/B220 (RA3-6B2); CD335/NKp46 (29A1.4). Commercial antibodies were purchased from Cedarlane, Merck, Bio-Rad, R&D
Systems, BD, ThermoFisher, Abcam, East Coast Biologics, Novus, Hypoxyprobe and BioLegend. HRP- conjugated secondary
antibodies (Vectastain Elite ABC Kits: PK-6200; Universal, PK-6101; Rabbit, PK-6104; Rat, PK-6105; Goat) were applied for
30 min and visualized with DAB (Vector Laboratories; SK-4100), or secondary Alexa Fluor 488 or �455 dye-conjugated antibodies
(Life Technologies) applied for 30 minutes at room temperature. Fluorescence antibody-labeled slides were mounted in fluorescent
mounting medium (Prolong Molecular Probes; P36934) post-treatment with 0.5 mg/ml Hoechst counter-stain. TUNEL analysis was
performed using the Apoptag Fluorescein In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Millipore; S7110) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, tissue sections were pre-treated in Proteinase K (20 mg/ml) for 15 min at room temperature, washed in deionized water twice
for 2 min each, and returned to PBS. Sections were then covered with equilibration buffer for a minimum of 2 min followed by incu-
bation at 37�C for 1 hr with a 1:5 dilution of TdT enzyme in reaction buffer, followed by fluorescein anti-digoxigenin conjugated
secondary antibody, washed, and mounted. To stain tissues systemically for hypoxia, 60 mg/kg hypoxyprobe-1 (1-{[2-hydroxy-3-
piperdinyl] propyl}-2-nitroimidazole hydrochloride) (Hypoxyprobe; HP1-100 kit) was administered through IP injection in saline
15 min prior to euthanasia. Protein adducts of reductively activated pimonidazole were identified through immunohistochemistry
in fixed tissues with a monoclonal antibody against hypoxyprobe-1.
RNA-ISH for MycERT2 was performed with a custom-designed probe targeting nucleotides 2110-3619 of Myc-ER-ires-EGFP
(Murphy et al., 2008), amplified with RNAscope 2.5 HD Reagent Kit (Advanced Cell Diagnostics; 322300) and developed with the
TSA Plus kit (PerkinElmer; NEL760001KT) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Images were collected with an Axiovert 5100
TV inverted fluorescence microscope (Zeiss) and Open Lab 3.5.1 software, or with an Axiovert 100 inverted microscope (Zeiss)
equipped with a Hamamatsu Orca digital camera (University of California, San Francisco), and a Zeiss Axio Imager M2 microscope
and Axiovision Rel 4.8 software (University of Cambridge).
Isolation of mouse lung tumor-associated macrophage RNA
After heart-perfusion with PBS, mouse lungs were harvested and macrophages isolated following the MACS cell-separation pro-
tocol according to manufacturer’s instructions (Miltenyi Biotec). Briefly: lung tissue was minced, incubated 15 minutes at 37�C in
Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS with 0.5% EDTA, passed through 40 mm Falcon cell strainers (352340) and re-suspended in erythrocyte lysis
buffer (RBC Tris-buffered ammonium chloride pH7.2) followed by dissociation buffer (PBS pH7.2 with 2mM EDTA). The resulting
homogenate was incubated with anti-F4/80 biotin-conjugated antibody (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-101-893) followed by streptavidin-
conjugated microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-101-893), or incubated with anti-F4/80 microbead-conjugated antibody (Miltenyi
Biotec, 130-110-443), passed through magnetic columns and the macrophages then transferred to TRizol (Ambion, 15596018)
for RNA isolation with the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN, 74134), according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Immune Array and determination of MycERT2, PD-L1, and VEGFA mRNA
14 weeks post AdV-Cre KM mouse lungs were isolated 8 hours after IP injection with either oil or tamoxifen and then snap frozen in
liquid nitrogen. Whole (tumor-laden) lung protein samples were isolated and incubated on a mouse inflammation antibody array
(Abcam, ab133999) according to manufacturer instructions. The intensity of the signals was analyzed using ImageJ.
Total RNA (0.5-1 mg) isolated from F4/80- lung- and tumor tissue or F4/80+ macrophages was reverse transcribed using the High
Capacity cDNA RT kit (Applied Biosystems, 4374966). Real-time quantitative RT–PCR (Fast Sybr Green, Applied Biosystems,
4385612) was used to quantify mRNA levels. The TBP and b-actin genes were used as an internal amplification control. TBP forward
primer: 50-ACTTCGTGCAAGAAATGCTGAAT-30, TBP reverse primer: 50- CAGTTGTCCGTGGCTCTCTTATT-30. b-actin forward
primer: 50-GACGATATCGCTGCGCTGG �30, b-actin reverse primer: 50-CCACGATGGAGGGGAATA-30. MycERT2 primers; forward:
50-ATTTCTGAAGACTTGTTGCGGAAA-30, reverse: 50- GCTGTTCTTAGAGCGTTTGATCATGA-30 (Murphy et al., Cancer Cell 14 (6),
2008). PD-L1 primers; forward: 50-GACCAGCTTTTGAAGGGAAATG-30, reverse: 50-CTGGTTGATTTTGCGGTATGG-30. VEGFA
primers were from Bio-Rad (10025636, qMmuCED0040260). Real-time PCR reactions were performed on an Eppendorf Mastercy-
cler Realpex 2 and analyzed with accompanying software.
Blocking antibodies and Flow Cytometric analysis
For antibody blocking experiments, mice were IP injected with either anti-IL23p19 or anti-CCL9 individually or together (see Figures 3
and S4) or with anti-PD-L1 every two days, starting one day before Myc activation by tamoxifen injection (see Figures 4 and S1). For
tumor regression studies, antibody ablation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells or NKp46+ cells was initiated four days before tamoxifen with-
drawal (see Figures 7, S1, and S6). Concentrations of antibodies and their isotype controls were adjusted in PBS as follows (see key
resources table): IL23p19 (MMp19B2) and Mouse IgG2b k Isotype control (MPC-11) 150 mg/mouse/IP; CCL9/10/MIP1g (AF463) and
goat IgG control (AB-108-C) 50 mg/mouse/IP; CD274/PD-L1 (10F.9G2) and Rat IgG2b k Isotype control (RTK4530) 150 mg/mouse/IP;
CD4 (GK1.5) and CD8 (2.43) and Rat IgG control (LTF2) 200 mg/mouse/IP; asialo-GM1 and Rabbit IgG control 100 ml/mouse/IP and
100 mg/mouse/IP, respectively. For Flow Cytometric identification of CD4 and CD8 positive T cells in spleen and blood of anti-CD4
and anti-CD8 treated mice, CD3ε (145-2C11), CD8a (53-6.7), CD4 (RM4-5, GK1.5) and CD45 (30-F11)-specific antibodies were used.

 For Flow Cytometric identification of NKp46 positive NK cells in blood and spleen of anti-asialo-GM1 treated mice NKp46 (29A1.4)-
specific antibody was used. For isolation and analysis of lung-specific NKp46+ cells whole lung tissue was minced, incubated 15 mi-
nutes at 37�C in Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS with 0.5% EDTA, passed through 40 mm Falcon cell strainers (352340) and re-suspended in
erythrocyte lysis buffer (RBC Tris-buffered ammonium chloride pH7.2) followed by dissociation buffer (PBS pH7.2 with 2mM
EDTA). The cell suspension was incubated with FITC-NKp46-specific antibody (eBioscience, 11-3351). Flow Cytometry was
performed on an Accuri C6 Flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with accompanying software. Commercial antibodies were
purchased from R&D Systems, BioLegend, BioXcell and Wako Chemicals.
Lectins
Lectin dyes Fluorescein-Lycopersicon esculentum (FL-1171) and Rhodamine-Ricinus communis agglutinin I (RL-1082) were
obtained from Vector Labs. Three minutes before sacrifice 100 mL of a 1:2 Fluorescein:Rhodamine solution was administered by
retro-orbital injection. Lungs were then harvested and fluorescence imaged on de-paraffinized tissue sections counterstained
with Hoechst dye.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Scanning H&E slides, ImageJ, and GraphPad.
H&E sections were scanned with an Aperio AT2 microscope (Leica Biosystems) at 20X magnification (resolution 0.5 microns per
pixel) and analyzed with Aperio Software. Quantifications were performed using ImageJ. Statistical analysis was performed in
GraphPad. Data points on the scatter dot graphs that portray quantification per Field of View represent one tumor (small data points)
and averages per mouse (large data points) simultaneously. A minimum of five tumors per mouse were analyzed. For comparison,
quantification of histological markers was only performed on tumor sections stained at the same time. For endothelial cell marker
CD31 the immunohistochemistry staining intensity was calculated as percentage CD31-positive area per Field of View using
ImageJ. For proliferation marker Ki67 the immunohistochemistry staining was quantified as percentage of total cells per Field of
View using ImageJ. For quantification of NK cell marker NKp46 a complete section of the lung of a mouse was analyzed. Scoring
(none, % 10 cells, > 10 cells) was based on the amount of juxta-tumoral NKp46+ cells visible. Only tumors directly lining and
associated with clearly distinguishable vasculature were taken into consideration. P values are derived from mouse-average com-
parisons between groups and determined via Student’s t test or two-way ANOVA (see figure legends). Bar graphs are represented as
mean with standard deviation. Quantifications in scatter dot-plot graphs show median with interquartile range.

either CD4+/CD8+ T cell competent animals (IgG-control) or CD4+/8+ T cell-deficient (aCD4/aCD8-treated) mice compared to 7 days of Myc activation (7d tam).
No significant differences in IgG control versus T cell depleted animals are evident.
(B) Quantification of immunostaining for proliferation (Ki67), CD206+ macrophages and T cells (CD3) following Myc de-activation for 3 days in KM tumors of either
NKp46+ NK cell competent animals (IgG-control) or NKp46+ NK cell-deficient (a-asialoGM1-treated) mice. No significant differences in IgG control versus NK-cell
depleted animals are evident for proliferation (Ki67) or T cells (CD3). In contrast, NK-cell depleted animals show reduced CD206 efflux following Myc de-
activation.
Quantification graphs: FoV = Field of View. (A): n = 20-25 individual tumors (small symbols) from 4 (7d Tam, IgG, large symbols) or 5 (aCD4/aCD8) mice per
treatment group. (B): n = 25-30 individual tumors (small symbols) from 5 mice (large symbols) per treatment group. Error bars represent the median with in-
terquartile range (Ki67, CD206, CD3) or mean ± SD (NKp46). P values are based on Student’s t test (Ki67, CD206, CD3) or two-way ANOVA (NKp46). NS = non-
significant, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
 Figure S7. Myc Instructs Stromal Changes in Lung Adenomas, Related to Figures 2, 3, 4, and 7
Schematic representation of Myc-induced stromal changes in lung adenocarcinoma. Activation of deregulated Myc in epithelial KRasG12D-driven lung adenoma
cells rapidly leads to efflux of B, T and NK lymphocytes and recruitment of macrophages. Myc-induced IL-23 promotes efflux of B, T and NK cells whereas Myc-
dependent CCL9 recruits macrophages. The macrophages stimulate angiogenesis via overt VEGF production and repel T cells via surface expression of PD-L1.
Myc-dependent tumor progression requires IL-23 and CCL9 signaling to NK cells and macrophages, respectively. De-activation of deregulated Myc in es-
tablished KRasG12D-Myc adenocarcinomas leads to the rapid reversal of these stromal changes, tumor cell death and regression.
