Real-time monitoring of cancer cells’ phenotypic evolution during therapy can provide vital
tumour biology information for treatment management. Circulating tumour cell (CTC) ana-
lysis has emerged as a useful monitoring tool, but its routine usage is restricted by either
limited multiplexing capability or sensitivity. Here, we demonstrate the use of antibody-
conjugated and Raman reporter-coated gold nanoparticles for simultaneous labelling and
monitoring of multiple CTC surface markers (named as “cell signature”), without the need for
isolating individual CTCs. We observe cell heterogeneity and phenotypic changes of mela-
noma cell lines during molecular targeted treatment. Furthermore, we follow the CTC sig-
nature changes of 10 stage-IV melanoma patients receiving immunological or molecular
targeted therapies. Our technique maps the phenotypic evolution of patient CTCs sensitively
and rapidly, and shows drug-resistant clones having different CTC signatures of potential
clinical value. We believe our proposed method is of general interest in the CTC relevant
research and translation fields.

 T
he analysis of circulating tumour cells (CTCs) is emerging
as a potentially valuable tool for monitoring cancer treat-
ment response and understanding tumour biology from a
simple blood test1. From a post-treatment clinical standpoint, it is
important to determine (i) the impact of treatment on the disease,
(ii) the presence of residual disease, (iii) the emergence of tumour
cells that are treatment resistant, including tumour cells able to
evade the immune system after immunotherapy, and (iv) the
escape mechanisms, which will in turn allow the modification of
the treatment approach. Therapeutic resistance may result from
selective and/or adaptive pressure that encourages proliferation of
the resistant cell population, which may be phenotypically dis-
tinct from their precursors in physical size, shape, and surface
marker expression1–4. Thus, conventional CTC monitoring which
targets precursor cells (e.g., by targeting the same surface mar-
kers) may fail to detect these vital phenotypically different
resistant clones.
Presently, CTCs are first isolated prior to downstream pheno-
typic or geno-typic analysis4. Most antibody-dependent CTC
isolation strategies rely on a single surface marker of interest, such
as epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). The CellSearch
system, which is the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-
approved CTC detection technology, is an example of such
technique4. These strategies are prone to disregard tumour cells
from (i) cancers of non-epithelial origin like melanoma, and (ii)
cancers with downregulated EpCAM expression. The down-
regulation of EpCAM commonly occurs during epithelial-to-
mesenchymal transition1, 4, which is a process widely associated
with treatment resistance in a variety of cancers5. On the other
hand,
antibody-free
isolation
strategies
such as
size-based
separation often fail to isolate all relevant cells because of vari-
able CTC physical properties6, 7.
Following CTC isolation, downstream CTC phenotypic ana-
lysis mainly includes protein expression-based techniques such as
flow cytometry, or nucleic acid-based techniques such as quan-
titative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-
PCR)4, 8. Flow cytometry is one of the most commonly used
techniques for cell characterisation but typically requires a rela-
tively large quantity of sample cells and has limited multiplexing
capabilities. New technologies such as CyTOF may be able to
overcome these limitations;9 however, it does not allow for the
collection of live cells for further analysis or imaging afterwards.
Although qRT-PCR is able to quantify relative expression of
target transcripts within low quantities of CTCs, it is unable to
directly quantify CTCs and determine their heterogeneity. Thus,
an innovative method that allows direct phenotypic character-
isation of multiple CTC surface markers with high sensitivity and
without prior isolation is highly desired.
Here, we describe an approach for observing CTC phenotypic
changes by monitoring the expression levels of multiple surface
markers simultaneously via surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy
(SERS). SERS is a spectroscopic technique that possesses detection
sensitivity
down
to
single
molecule
level
under
certain
conditions10, 11 (such as when molecules are located in the “hot
spots”)12, 13, and multiplexing capability14, 15. To demonstrate our
technique, we test melanoma cell lines and melanoma CTCs, as
melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer and has a rapid rise
in incidence16. We select four melanoma CTC surface markers,
including melanoma-chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan (MCSP)
17–22 and melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM)23–26 which
are expressed in over 85 and 70% of the primary and metastatic
melanoma lesions, respectively;27, 28 erythroblastic leukaemia viral
oncogene homologue 3 (ErbB3)29, which is involved in therapy
resistance development through activation of an alternative phos-
phoinositide 3-kinase–v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene
homologue (PI3K–AKT) pathway;30, 31 and low-affinity nerve
growth factor receptor (LNGFR)32, a stem-cell biomarker which is
strongly associated with resistance development33. The specific
antibodies for targeting each surface marker are conjugated to
SERS labels (i.e., Raman reporter-coated gold nanoparticles
(AuNPs)), and a unique Raman spectrum (fingerprint) for each
SERS label is generated upon a common laser wavelength excita-
tion (Supplementary Fig. 1). The four Raman reporter-surface
marker pairings are: 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (MBA) for MCSP;
2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-4-mercaptobenzoic acid (TFMBA) for MCAM;
4-Mercapto-3-nitro benzoic acid (MNBA) for ErbB3; and 4-
mercaptopyridine (MPY) for LNGFR (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Detection specificity and sensitivity are assessed and validated
using multiple cell lines and healthy donor samples. We then apply
our methodology to monitor cellular phenotypic changes of mel-
anoma cell lines harbouring BRAF mutations34 in response to
BRAF inhibitor (PLX4720). This newly FDA-approved drug could
selectively inhibit mutated BRAF gene present in approximately
50% of melanoma35. We further examine blood samples collected
serially from 10 stage-IV melanoma patients at different time
points during their treatment course and monitor changes in their
CTC phenotypes. We find that drug-resistant clones have different
CTC phenotypes of potential clinical value.
Results
Working scheme. The working principle of our method for
phenotypic characterisation of CTCs from blood samples is
illustrated in Fig. 1. Briefly, blood samples are processed for
removal of red blood cells and leucocytes by density gradient
centrifugation and CD45 depletion, respectively. Remaining cells
are incubated with the four different antibody-conjugated SERS
labels (Ab-SERS labels) and then simultaneously detected by
Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 1a). Isotype-matched immunoglobulin
(IgG)-SERS labels are used as an internal negative control in our
experiments. For each sample, 150 measurements are con-
tinuously collected to represent different portions of cells that are
undergoing Brownian motion in the solution (Fig. 1a). Each SERS
measurement generates one SERS spectrum that is the statistically
averaged result of a large ensemble of labelled cells within the
scattering volume. The signal intensity is, therefore, proportional
to the number of cells and their marker expression levels in the
scattering volume.
The detection signals of each sample were analysed by profiling
both surface marker signal distribution (Fig. 1b, c) and expression
signatures (Fig. 1d). Spectral deconvolution was performed before
signal analysis to minimise the potential overlap between
characteristic peaks of different Raman reporters, in which a
Gaussian
function
was
used
(Supplementary
Fig.
2,
and
Supplementary Table 1). The signal distribution curve was then
generated by plotting the Raman signal from each measurement
(frequency vs. Raman intensity), thereby displaying the expres-
sion level distribution across all measured events. We hypothe-
sised that the more diverse and heterogeneous the sample
population, the wider the signal distribution of the respective
markers (Fig. 1c). Hence, the selection of subclones or adaptation
to specific selective pressure during treatment should result in a
narrowed signal distribution spectrum to reflect more homo-
geneous phenotypes. In contrast, the signal distribution should
broaden after resistance establishment. The cell signature, defined
by the relative average expression levels of four markers, was
extracted by collating the characteristic peak intensities of
corresponding Ab-SERS labels with either MBA, TFMBA,
MNBA, or MPY reporters (represented by peaks at 1075, 1375,
1335, and 1000 cm−1, respectively). As cell populations with
different phenotypes will have distinct combinations of surface
marker expression levels, this profile is unique to each sample.

 Single-cell SERS image was obtained by using the integrated
Raman intensity of the characteristic peak from each Ab-SERS
label. The colour (i.e., blue, red, green, and purple) of each spot in
Fig. 2b represents the spatial distribution of Ab-SERS labels,
which further indicates the cell surface marker distribution.
Assay specificity. To demonstrate the specificity of each Ab-SERS
label alone and in combination, we first tested the performance of
Ab-SERS labels in cell lines that have been well characterised and

reported for high expression of MCSP and MCAM36, was chosen

Fig. 1 CTC detection and characterisation with Raman spectroscopy. a, b Schematics of experimental workflow: the blood sample taken from a patient is
first depleted of RBC and PBMCs by processing over density gradient centrifugation (Ficoll) and subsequent CD45 depletion. Remaining cells are incubated
with antibody-conjugated and Raman reporter-coated gold nanoparticles (Ab-SERS labels). The sample is subsequently washed and tested with Raman
spectroscopy. To characterise the CTC populations, the Raman intensities are plotted as a frequency distribution curve. This curve represents the sample’s
range of expression. Higher intensity indicates the presence of more Ab-SERS labels as a result of higher marker expression levels or number of cells. Four
melanoma surface marker antibodies (MCSP, MCAM, ErbB3, and LNGFR) with four specific SERS labels can be multiplexed for monitoring the CTC surface
marker expression simultaneously; c CTC populations in response to treatment: the frequency distribution of each marker can signal how diverse the cell
populations are in terms of surface marker expression levels. The more diverse and heterogeneous the sample population, the wider the signal distribution
of the respective markers. Selection of subclones or adaptation to specific selective pressure results in on-treatment signatures with a narrowing spectrum
of phenotypes, while after resistance establishment phenotypic spreading can be observed. d CTC signature in response to treatment: the relationship
between the average Raman intensities of each surface maker represents the CTC signature. This signature is unique to each cell population. Shrinking of
all marker intensities but retaining the relationships (CTC signature) could mean diminished cell number (tumour regression). Changing of CTC signature
means the population now has a different phenotype, which could represent a treatment-resistant cell population

 SK-MEL-28 cells, indicating high expression of MCSP and
MCAM in SK-MEL-28 cells, and low SERS signals from MCF7,
suggesting low expression of MCSP and MCAM in MCF7 cells.
This result demonstrated the specificity of our SERS technique for
the detection of MCSP and MCAM individually. Moreover, we
tested the specificity of ErbB3 and LNGFR in MCF7 and SKBR3
cell lines, and in SK-MEL-28 and bone marrow mesenchymal
stem cells, respectively. Different marker expression levels in
these reported cell lines were successfully identified from resulting
ErbB3-MNBA and LNGFR-MPY signals (Supplementary Fig. 3c,
d), which were in line with literature reports36, 40–43. Further-
more, we tested the specificity of four antibodies together in both
SK-MEL-28 and MCF7 cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 3e), which
showed consistent results as determined by individual antibodies
(R2 = 0.996 for SK-MEL-28, and R2 = 0.985 for MCF7, Supple-
mentary Fig. 3f). To further demonstrate the specificity of our
assay, flow cytometry detection was performed for validation and
showed agreement with SERS data (Supplementary Fig. 4). Taken
together, consistent results between SERS and flow cytometry
data further demonstrated the high specificity of Ab-SERS labels
along with minimum to no unspecific noise signal for cell surface
marker detection.
To further validate that the proposed approach is capable of
analysing CTC without an isolation step, our developed and well-
characterised melanoma cell lines (LM-MEL-15, 30, 35, 42, 44,
45, 53, 62, 64, and 100)34, one cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), and
healthy donors’ peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)
samples were incubated with MCSP-SERS labels as proof-of-
principle. MCSP is reported to be expressed on the majority of
melanoma cell lines but absent on HeLa cells and PBMCs36. Our
results showed varied MCSP expression across the different
melanoma cell lines, while HeLa cells and PBMCs exhibited
negligible background signals (Supplementary Fig. 5). SERS
image of the mixed tumour cells and blood cells only indicated
signals of MCSP-MBA-AuNPs from tumour cells, further
confirming the high specificity of this approach (Supplementary
Fig. 6).
Assay sensitivity. The sensitivity of using each Ab-SERS label
alone and in combination for cell detection was explored by
titrating 10–1000 cells (either SK-MEL-28 or MCF7) into 1 mL of
PBS. As demonstrated in Supplementary Fig. 7, each antibody-
SERS label alone and in combination enable the detection down
to 10 cells, demonstrating that our technique is sensitive for cell
characterisation.
To further evaluate the sensitivity of using our technique to
detect CTCs, different numbers of our developed LM-MEL-64
cell line cells in 1 mL of PBS (Supplementary Fig. 8) and 10 mL of
whole blood (Supplementary Fig. 9) were labelled with MCSP-
SERS labels for detection. In Supplementary Fig. 8, Raman
intensities showed a positive correlation with increasing cell
numbers, and a detection limit of 10 cells was distinguished from
the blank PBS signal. In Supplementary Fig. 9, although the
average Raman intensities also increased with higher cell
numbers, the results showed a relatively lower intensity and
larger standard deviation, compared to those titrated into PBS
(Supplementary Fig. 8). This is possibly due to the unpredictable
loss of CTCs during sample processing, a well-known technical
barrier. The signal with 250–1000 spiked cells was significantly
lower as cells were lost more readily in those groups. Currently, a
significant sensitivity improvement in patient samples has been
achieved
based
on
multi-molecular
markers25
or
protein
markers18, compared to single marker assays. We thus used
multiple markers to increase the probability of detecting the low
quantity of remaining CTCs.
Cell characterisation. All four Ab-SERS labels were incubated
with various melanoma cell lines to visualise their respective cell
signatures. The distinct cell signatures among different cell lines
were shown in Fig. 2a. For example, LM-MEL-64 has very high
MCSP and MCAM expression levels but low ErbB3 and LNGFR
levels, whereas LM-MEL-100 has lower MCSP and MCAM
expression levels but significantly higher ErbB3 expression
(Fig. 2a). Isotype controls were also performed and demonstrated
that melanoma cells labelled with IgG-SERS labels exhibited
negligible SERS signals (Supplementary Fig. 10). These data
demonstrate that our method can distinguish tumour cells of
differential surface marker expression signatures.
To demonstrate that four markers are useful for the detection
of different CTC signatures, we applied linear discriminant
analysis (LDA) to discriminate three typical melanoma cell lines
using different numbers of markers as indicated in Supplemen-
tary Fig. 11. LDA is a statistical analysis that characterises or
separates clusters based on the linear combination of features (i.e.,
cell signatures characterised by signals of target-specific SERS
labels). We found that the discriminant function based on only
one marker (i.e., MCSP) was unable to discriminate three
melanoma cell lines, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 11a. With
two markers (i.e., MCSP and MCAM), the discrimination
accuracy for the three melanoma cell lines improved significantly
(Supplementary Fig. 11b). Complete discrimination of three
melanoma cell lines was achieved with discriminant functions
generated by four markers (Supplementary Fig. 11c). Thus, these
statistical data showed that these four markers were very helpful
for the identification of melanoma cell subpopulations.
Figure 2b (left) shows SERS images of a single cell (LM-MEL-
64) displaying each surface marker and demonstrating the
multiplexing capability of Raman spectroscopy at single cell
level. Figure 2b (middle) shows the Raman signal distribution
constructed from 150 independent samplings (red) in compar-
ison to isotype control (blue), exemplifying the heterogeneity
within melanoma cell lines. The result matched those of flow
cytometry (Fig. 2b (right)) using the same four antibodies but
labelled
with
fluorophore-conjugated
secondary
antibodies
instead of Ab-SERS labels. Five other cell lines (LM-MEL-15,
30, 35, 44, and 62) were also tested and correlated well with flow
cytometry validation (Supplementary Figs. 12–16).
To directly visualise melanoma’s cell heterogeneity within a
single cell line, the distribution of four surface markers on each
cell was imaged, and the relative expression level of each marker
was compared (Supplementary Fig. 17). We investigated three cell
lines (LM-MEL-33, 64, and 70) and five individual cells from each
cell line. These data clearly showed cell heterogeneity with varied
surface marker expression among individual cells of the same cell
line. Hence, we believe that the highly sensitive and multiplexing
capability of our proposed approach is ideal for characterising
melanoma cells comprehensively.
Cell line models in response to molecular targeted therapy. To
test the capability of our methodology in tracking the evolution of
a resistant cell population, cellular phenotypic changes under-
going targeted therapy were assessed. Three melanoma cell lines
harbouring an activating mutation in BRAF were treated con-
tinuously with PLX4720 (a BRAF inhibitor) to develop drug
resistance. Surviving cells were obtained at regular intervals (days
0, 3, 7, 11, 17, 35, and 70). Within 3 days of drug treatment (day
3), distinct cell signatures were observed as compared to the
respective controls (day 0, without drug treatment). Cell sig-
natures then became stable after drug treatment for 11, 17, and
35 days (Fig. 3a), respectively. More importantly, these drug-
treated melanoma cell lines displayed a similar cell signature after

 chronic PLX4720 exposure for 10 weeks with respect to the four
markers measured, probably due to the effect of drug resistance
selection. The signal distribution plots showed narrowed signal
distribution (Fig. 3b) at early drug introduction, signifying drug
selection of resistant clones and loss of the population hetero-
geneity. As the resistant clones expanded subsequently, we started
to observe surface marker upregulation and signal distribution
widening, thereby signifying proliferation and progression of the
resistant clones. All of the cell line SERS data (Supplementary
Figs. 18–21) have also been cross-validated with flow cytometry
measurements (Supplementary Figs. 22–25), which displayed
similar trends.
LDA was further applied to evaluate cell population shifts
(based on SERS signals regarding four marker expression) in
response to the drug treatment (Supplementary Fig. 26). For
visualisation of subpopulations, discriminant functions 1 and 2
derived from LDA were selected due to their relative efficiency in
resolving cell line subpopulations. All three melanoma cell lines
formed distinct subpopulations after drug treatment, and the
subpopulations of drug-treated cell lines continuously shifted
with drug treatment. This confirmed the effect of drug treatment
on
cell
signatures,
resulting
in
significantly
different
cell
signatures from their parental counterparts.
Patient CTCs in response to therapy. To examine the capability
of our method in monitoring patient therapy responses, we
applied it to detect patient blood samples. Ten stage-IV mela-
noma patients’ blood samples were serially collected during the
course of treatment. Based on the initial radiological response to

 therapy, they could be broadly classified as: (1) treatment
responders with objective diminish in tumour load, (2) non-
responders with either increase or no radiological evidence of a
decrease in tumour burden, and (3) mixed-responders, where
some of the metastases responded, and others did not.
The CTC signatures and signal distribution for all patients
during therapy treatment are shown in Fig. 4 and Supplementary
Figs. 27–35. Changes to the CTC signatures showed variations in
expression levels of the respective markers (i) in relation to each
other and (ii) overall in the CTC population. On the other hand,
cell heterogeneity could often be seen in the treatment naïve or
resistant group, which could be due to either plastic changes in
gene expression or clonal selection of resistant cells.
For example, patient 1 (Fig. 4) received dabrafenib and
trametinib, a BRAF-inhibitor and an MEK-inhibitor, respectively,
for 1 month. Despite the objective clinical improvement,

 treatment was discontinued because of toxicity. The CTC
signature showed markedly reduced signal intensities in all
markers with effective treatment, especially a significantly down-
regulated LNGFR level (from 56% of the MCSP signal to just 4%)
(Fig. 4a). However, as the patient’s tumour progressed upon
cessation of treatment, the CTC signature returned to pre-
treatment pattern (with the return of LNGFR expression to 61%
of the MCSP signal intensity). The signal distribution plot showed
a
much
wider
distribution
during
active
disease
and
a
significantly narrower distribution while the patient was on
treatment (Fig. 4b). This could signify the selection pressure from
treatment, resulting in the elimination of drug-sensitive cells. This
pattern of “narrowing” signal distribution during treatment
response was seen several times in our patient cohort. LDA was
performed to statistically analyse all SERS signals that were
collected from patient 1. Figure 4c shows that CTC populations
shifted after drug treatment for 40 days and formed a total
different cluster on day 48, indicating the shift of CTC
populations in response to dabrafenib and trametinib treatment.
Discussion
Current strategies for monitoring melanoma therapeutic resis-
tance are insufficient. Radiological imaging (e.g., CT and PET) is
insensitive to the detection of small lesions and provides limited
information on tumour biology44. Although other many potential
markers have been tested in melanoma, the only standard prog-
nostic tumour marker—lactate dehydrogenase—is a non-specific
enzyme that can be elevated in various benign or malignant
diseases45. Circulating tumour DNA is a complementary marker
to CTCs for detecting recurring disease and monitoring disease
progression or therapeutic success;4, 8 however, it cannot be used
for phenotypic classification. Thus, CTC detection is anticipated
to provide invaluable real-time biomarker information during
treatment monitoring.
Compared with other CTC detection technologies8, our study
demonstrated an extremely sensitive, highly multiplexed, and
simple method to rapidly detect real-time changes in CTC phe-
notypes and heterogeneity by monitoring surface protein expres-
sion profiles. We were able to detect 10 tumour cells in 10 mL of
blood (Supplementary Fig. 9), which was comparable to other
reported technologies such as the CellSearch system46, 47 and CTC-
Chip48–51. In addition, our method also displayed cell heterogeneity
(Supplementary Fig. 17) and changes in tumour cell populations in
response to molecular targeted therapy (Fig. 3). Currently, multi-
parametric flow cytometry has been applied to detect multi-marker
expressions in CTCs;36 however, its detection sensitivity is
~2000–15,000-fold lower than SERS technology52. Finally, we have
comprehensively profiled diverse CTC populations from 10 patient
blood samples before treatment and at multiple time points during
treatment (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Figs. 27–35), which clearly
demonstrated the capability of our technology in a clinical setting.
The high sensitivity of our technology could be attributed to three
reasons: (1) no prior CTC isolation, that reduced CTC loss during
the isolation process; (2) multi-marker-based CTC detection that
increased the probability of detecting rare CTCs; (3) ultra-sensitive
and multiplexed detection technology that allowed simultaneous
characterisation of multiple markers expressed on the surface of
rare CTCs. In comparison, antibody-dependent methods21, 53,
which require prior CTC isolation and/or rely on a single surface
marker of interest, are prone to disregard tumour cells that have
low target marker expression. Given that our technique is capable
of effectively evaluating CTC phenotypes and heterogeneity in
response to therapy, we thus believe it could be a big step towards
understanding CTC characteristics (i.e., phenotypes) and promot-
ing CTC clinical applications.
Sensitive and simple method to characterise CTC phenotypes
in response to drug treatment could greatly improve our ability to
study tumour’s phenotypic alterations with treatment. This could
help us understand important biological questions such as resis-
tance mechanisms and discover novel therapeutic targets like
receptor tyrosine kinases and other antibody targets. A recent
report has demonstrated that subpopulations of melanoma CTCs
show differential response to targeted therapy36. LNGFR has been
described to be a potential marker of melanoma tumour stem
cells with a high propensity to establish tumours32, 54. Other
studies have also demonstrated that LNGFR is often upregulated
and associated with resistance development33, 55. In line with
these reports, patients 3 and 4 (Supplementary Figs. 28, 29) in our
report both responded to immunotherapy (CheckMate trial) or
targeted therapy (dabrafenib and trametinib) with significantly
upregulated LNGFR expression on CTC surfaces. Concurrently,
both patients’ tumours developed resistance with subsequent
worsening of disease after the last blood samples were taken (data
not shown). Similarly, ErbB3 has been shown to be an important
factor in resistance and metastasis development29, 56, and can be
seen to be upregulated in patient 3 and 6 who showed tumour
progression while on treatment (Supplementary Figs. 28, 31).
In our study, we have also reiterated the importance of using
multiple markers simultaneously in the detection of CTCs to
increase sensitivity. Both patient 2 and 4 had markedly reduced
MCSP expression post-treatment (Supplementary Figs. 27, 29).
An isolation/detection technique targeting only MCSP would
have failed to isolate the majority of their CTCs.
The number of melanoma CTCs has been shown to be prog-
nostic of the overall survival in patients with metastatic mela-
noma53. It has been previously proposed that one could quantify
CTC numbers by correlating the obtained Raman signal intensity
to a cell number correlation curve generated using a cell line57.
Our study also showed that the relative intensity change could
provide a rough guide regarding to changes to CTC numbers
within the same patient. It is worth noting that the observed
signal changes may also arise from marker expression changes on
a similar number CTCs. With simple modifications, such as a
ferrous coating of our described NPs, our technique can poten-
tially be used to capture and enumerate CTCs, and provide
downstream analysis of other biomarkers such as epigenetic and
transcriptional levels.
High multiplexing capability of Raman spectra (up to 31-plex)
14, 15 permits the incorporation of numerous markers to track
CTCs’ phenotypic changes with treatment. The technique has the
potential to be adopted widely as it is becoming more affordable
and portable (Supplementary Fig. 36 shows one typical SERS
spectrum for one of the patient samples obtained from the hand-
held Raman spectrometer). Healthcare institutions will be able to
equip with such device for simpler treatment and disease
monitoring.
Methods
Clinical sample acquisition. This study was conducted according to the National
Health & Medical Research Council Australian Code for the responsible conduct of
Research and the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research. All
patients have provided their written informed consent for the research study
protocol, which was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the
Austin Hospital, Melbourne. Ethics approval was obtained from The University of
Queensland Institutional Human Research Ethics Committee (Approval No.
2011001315). Methods pertaining to clinical samples were carried out in accor-
dance with approved guidelines.
Cell lines. Twelve melanoma cell lines, LM-MEL-15, 30, 33, 35, 42, 44, 45, 53, 62,
64, 70, and 100, were established at the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research in
Melbourne and were authenticated by short-tandem repeat profiling. SK-MEL-28,
SKBR3, MCF7, and HeLa cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection, being used for the specificity or sensitivity assay. Melanoma cells, SK-

 MEL-28, SKBR3, MCF7, and HeLa cells, were maintained in RF10 medium which
is made up of RPMI 1640 media (Invitrogen), 10% foetal calf serum (FCS) (CSL), 2
mM Glutamax (Gibco), and 1% PenStrep (Invitrogen). BD-MSC cell line was
purchased from Rooster Bio company (Donor number: 0081) and cultured
according to the standard method. BD-MSC at passage 13 was collected for the
experiment. All cells were kept in a humidified incubator in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. All
cell lines were routinely tested for mycoplasma.
Treatment with BRAF inhibitor. Melanoma cells (LM-MEL 33, 64, and 70) were
grown in medium with 1 μM PLX4720 (Selleckchem).
PBMC isolation. Blood samples were collected in EDTA containing 50 mL falcon
tubes and processed within 4 h from collection over Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE
Healthcare Life Science), according to manufacturer’s protocol. Isolated PBMC
from each 10 mL of blood were stored in a CryoTubes (Corning) containing 80%
RF10, 10% DMSO, and 10% FCS at −80 °C. Healthy donors’ blood was obtained
from Red Cross blood bank and processed the same way as patient samples.
CD45 depletion. PBMCs were depleted with the EasySep Human CD45 depletion
kit (StemCell), according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Flow cytometry. Flow cytometry was performed on BD Accuri™ C6. Cells resus-
pended in 200 µL of FACS buffer (PBS containing 3% FCS, 1% BSA, and 1 mM
EDTA) were incubated with 0.25 µg of either anti-MCSP, anti-MCAM, anti-ErbB3,
or anti-LNGFR mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAB2585, MAB932, MAB348/
MAB3481, and MAB367, R&D Systems) or isotype-matched control (Normal
mouse IgG sc-2025, Santa Cruz Biotech) prior to staining with labelled secondary
antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG antibody, A-11001, Life Tech-
nologies) diluted 1:2000 in FACS buffer. Data were analysed with BD Accuri™
C6 software.
Ab-SERS label preparation. Gold(III) chloride trihydrate (HAuCl4 · 3H2O), MBA,
5, 5′-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), TFMBA, MPY, sodium borohydride
(NaBH4), 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA), bovine serum albumin (BSA), 4-
(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), N-(3-dimethyl-ami-
nopropyl)-N′-ethyl-carbodiimide (EDC), and sulfo-N-hydroxy-sulfosuccinimide
(Sulfo-NHS) were purchased from Sigma, Aldrich, Fluka, Thermo Scientific,
respectively. Tris-sodium citrate (Na3-citrate) was bought from Ajax Finechem. To
synthesise MNBA, fresh 300 µL of 20 mM NaBH4 was added into 2 mL of 5 mM
DTNB to break the disulphide bond in DTNB through reducing reaction.
Ab-SERS labels were prepared by functionalizing AuNPs with Raman reporters
and antibodies. Briefly, 60 nm AuNPs were synthesised by citrate reduction of
HAuCl458. 100 mL of HAuCl4 (10−2% by weight) was heated to boiling, and 0.7 mL
of Na3-citrate (1% by weight) was then added. The mixture was continously boiling
for 20 min and then cooled down to room temperature (RT) for further
functionalization. 10 µL of 1 mM Raman reporters (MBA, MNBA, MPY, or TFMBA)
and 2 µL of 1.0 mM MUA (antibody conjugation linker) in ethanol were then added
into 1 mL of AuNP suspension. The mixture was incubated for 5 h at RT to form a
complete self-assembled monolayer. The mixture was then centrifuged at 7600 rpm
for 10 min to remove residual reactants and resuspended in 200 µL of HEPES buffer
(pH = 5.9). Afterwards, carboxyl groups of MUA were activated by EDC and Sulfo-
NHS (40 µL of 3.33 mg mL−1 EDC and 40 µL of 2 mg mL−1 Sulfo-NHS) in HEPES
buffer at RT for 20 min under shaking. SERS labels were then centrifuged to remove
excess EDC and Sulfo-NHS and redispersed into 200 µL of 0.1 mM PBS. 1 µg of
either human anti-MCSP, anti-MCAM, anti-ErbB3, and anti-LNGFR mouse
monoclonal antibodies (MAB2585, MAB932, MAB348/MAB3481, and MAB367,
R&D Systems) or isotype-matched IgG (Normal mouse IgG sc-2025, Santa Cruz
Biotech) was then added to the mixture and incubated for 0.5 h at RT. After that, Ab-
SERS labels were centrifuged at 600 × g at 4 °C for 8 min to remove free antibodies
and resuspended in 200 µL of 0.1% BSA for 0.5 h at RT to block non-specific binding
sites. To minimise the settlement effect of large Ab-SERS labels, Ab-SERS labels were
centrifuged at 400 × g for 2 min before being applied for labelling.
Ab-SERS labelling for cell line and CTC detection. Cells suspended in 200 µL of
buffer (PBS containing 1% FCS) were incubated with the mixture of four Ab-SERS
labels (30 µL each) at 37 °C for 30 min followed by gentle centrifuge at 400 × g for 1
min and washing with 200 µL of buffer. The washing step was repeated for four
times. The samples were then re-suspended in 60 μL of buffer and placed into a
cuvette for SERS measurements. To minimise data variations caused by different
cell numbers, the same amount of cells from different cell lines were tested across
the assays.
Patient sample experiments were done in a blinded fashion. All patient samples
had been de-identified by a research assistant not involved in the experiment and
only revealed after the spectra were analysed. All samples were prepared and
measured on the same day at the same time using the same batch of SERS labels.
SERS measurement. SERS spectra were recorded with a portable IM-52 Raman
Microscope (Snowy Range Instruments). The 785 nm laser wavelength was used
for excitation of Raman scattering. SERS spectra were obtained at 1 s integration
time with a laser power of 70 mW. SERS images were recorded with the Witec
alpha 300 R microscope with 632.8-nm line from a HeNe laser as excitation and
obtained at 100 ms integration time with an EMCCD, using a 20× microcopy
objective.
SERS spectral analysis. A Gaussian function was applied to deconvolute the
resulting Raman spectrum into separate sources to minimise the potential overlap
between characteristic peaks, using Fityk 0.9.8 program59. With this function, we
fitted peaks or separated close peaks according to peak positions, intensities, and
full width at half maximum.
Statistical analysis. LDA was performed with SPSS 19.0 software package (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL).
