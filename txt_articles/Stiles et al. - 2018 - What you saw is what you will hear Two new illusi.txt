Abstract
Neuroscience investigations are most often focused on the prediction of future perception or
decisions based on prior brain states or stimulus presentations. However, the brain can also
process information retroactively, such that later stimuli impact conscious percepts of the sti-
muli that have already occurred (called “postdiction”). Postdictive effects have thus far been
mostly unimodal (such as apparent motion), and the models for postdiction have accordingly
been limited to early sensory regions of one modality. We have discovered two related multi-
modal illusions in which audition instigates postdictive changes in visual perception. In the
first illusion (called the “Illusory Audiovisual Rabbit”), the location of an illusory flash is influ-
enced by an auditory beep-flash pair that follows the perceived illusory flash. In the second
illusion (called the “Invisible Audiovisual Rabbit”), a beep-flash pair following a real flash sup-
presses the perception of the earlier flash. Thus, we showed experimentally that these two
effects are influenced significantly by postdiction. The audiovisual rabbit illusions indicate
that postdiction can bridge the senses, uncovering a relatively-neglected yet critical type of
neural processing underlying perceptual awareness. Furthermore, these two new illusions
broaden the Double Flash Illusion, in which a single real flash is doubled by two sounds.
Whereas the double flash indicated that audition can create an illusory flash, these rabbit
illusions expand audition’s influence on vision to the suppression of a real flash and the relo-
cation of an illusory flash. These new additions to auditory-visual interactions indicate a spa-
tio-temporally fine-tuned coupling of the senses to generate perception.
Introduction
Postdiction occurs when later sensory stimuli impact the perception of already-presented sti-
muli [1–3]. This type of perceptual processing is particularly prevalent in short time scales of
less than a quarter of a second. Several known perceptual effects are postdictive in nature. For
instance, apparent motion occurs when a stimulus is presented at two discrete locations but is
perceived to move continuously and smoothly across the screen from the first to the second

 location [4–7]. This effect is, at least in part, postdictive as the smooth motion perception
occurs even if the direction of the stimuli movement is randomized (and consequently cannot
be predicted) [8]. The second flash’s location retroactively influences the perception of the
motion trajectory, generating the impression of smooth movement between the two locations.
Another example of postdiction, the cutaneous rabbit illusion, occurs when the forearm is
tapped five times in three separate locations (2 ms per tap, separated by 40–80 ms) [9]. The
taps are then perceived to be distributed (approximately uniformly) along the forearm rather
than in 3 discrete locations [9]. Depending on the number of the taps, the position perceived
for each tap is influenced retroactively so that the taps are evenly distributed between the loca-
tions of first and last tap. Other effects that are at least in part postdictive include backward
masking, the flash lag effect, and the TMS-triggered scotoma effect [4, 5, 9–15]. To date, most
postdictive effects that have been reported occur within one modality (one notable exception
being the crossmodal flash-lag [10], which is audiovisual). Accordingly, models for how post-
diction might be processed in the sensory regions of the brain have been primarily limited to
the sensory regions of one modality. (Note: We will review the multisensory literature and the
relevance of our experiments to previous effects in the discussion section.)
Models of the neural processing of postdiction explain how a stimulus presented later in
time may impact a stimulus presented earlier [1, 15, 16]. For example, if a later-presented stim-
ulus can “catch-up” to an earlier one in the processing pipeline, then the two stimuli can be
integrated, and perception modified accordingly (Note: this type of model is based on the con-
cept that conscious perception only occurs many milliseconds following stimuli presentation
[15, 17]). Several other computational and neural models also exist and will be discussed in
more depth in the discussion section.
In this paper we present two new postdictive effects that use spatial motion (as in apparent
motion and cutaneous rabbit effects), but also rely on the combination of visual and auditory
perception. In the first illusion, the Illusory Audiovisual Rabbit, with a sequence of [beep-flash,
beep, beep-flash], an illusory flash is perceived during the second beep (all beeps are presented
in the same central location). The illusory flash location is determined by the location of the
beep-flash pair presented after it (Fig 1A and S1 Movie; originally reported by Kamitani et al.
in 2001 in abstract form). In the second illusion, the Invisible Audiovisual Rabbit, with a
sequence of [beep-flash, flash, beep-flash], the second flash is suppressed by the presence of a
flash-beep pair presented after it (Fig 1B and S2 Movie). These new illusions indicate that an
illusory flash can be assigned a location postdictively, and that visual perception can be sup-
pressed postdictively. Moreover, these new audiovisual effects indicate that crossmodal post-
dictive processing occurs, and broaden the types of crossmodal effects, which have postdictive
processing. We will briefly explore modifications to the current postdictive neural models that
could explain these two new crossmodal illusions.
Materials and methods
Overview
We will describe ten different experiments, though some experiments were conducted within
the same experimental block and experimental session. (We chose this way of description for a
more straightforward communication.) We will refer to an experimental block to be a set of
trials with interleaved conditions all with the same questions. We will refer to a session as a
time period in which multiple blocks were performed with one or more experiments in each
block. Five of these experiments demonstrate the Illusory Audiovisual Rabbit (Experiments
1.1–1.5) and five of them demonstrate the Invisible Audiovisual Rabbit (Experiments 2.1–2.5).
Experiments 1.1, and 2.1 were conducted in the same block, with participants reporting how

 many flashes they perceived when experiencing various combinations of beeps and flashes.
Experiment 2.2 was designed to test if the Invisible AV rabbit is postdictive in nature, and
required the reporting of the number of flashes perceived. Experiments 1.2 and 2.3 both asked
participants to report the locations of the flashes that they perceived, but were conducted in
separate blocks. Experiment 1.3 was designed to test whether the perceived location of an illu-
sory flash is generated postdictively, by randomly varying the direction of movement between
the physical flashes. Experiments 1.4 and 2.4 were conducted in the same block, and probed
the strength of the illusions at different eccentricities. Experiments 1.5 and 2.5 were conducted
in the same block, and asked participants to rate their confidence in their responses about the
number of flashes that they perceived.
Participants
Thirteen participants (4 male and 9 female) took part in the experiments, though some partici-
pants did not complete all experiments. Subjects were all naive and told only the task they
needed to complete (i.e. count the number of flashes etc.), but not the goal of the experiment.
Experiment 1.1 and 2.1 had seven participants (N = 7). Experiment 1.2, 1.3, 1.5, 2.2, 2.3, and
2.5 had the same seven participants from Experiment 1.1 and 2.1 plus one additional partici-
pant (N = 8). Experiments 1.4 and 2.4 had five new participants (N = 5). All participants
reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision and normal hearing. Experiments were

gave informed written consent.
Stimuli
Participants were seated 57 cm away from a monitor with a 60 Hz refresh rate (Fig 2A). The
visual stimulus was a series of light gray bars (80% of the maximum screen brightness) pre-
sented on a dark gray background (30% brightness). The bars were 0.28 degrees of visual angle
in width, and 1.2 degrees in length. In all experiments except the eccentricity experiment, the
bars were presented 10 degrees below the fixation point (the eccentricity experiment had
eccentricities at 4, 10, and 16 degrees below the fixation point). Flashes were 1.42 degrees apart
when there were 3 flashes presented, and 2.84 degrees apart when two flashes were presented
(this is the distance from the center of the first flash to the center of the next flash). Each flash
was 17 ms in duration (one screen flip). Fig 2 shows the precise timing of each of the stimuli
conditions presented. The room was dimly lit; there were no overhead lights, and ambient
light was mostly shielded by a black curtain. The head was unconstrained, but was gently stabi-
lized using a chin rest.
The auditory stimuli were presented using two speakers, which were on either side of the
screen, and simultaneously presented the same auditory stimulus. Beeps were a 7 ms long 800
Hz modulated by a square wave. An oscilloscope was used to verify the correct timing of the
beeps and flashes (Fig 2). We set the delay between the beeps and flashes (Fig 2) as 23 ms to be
consistent with the double flash illusion as well as to account for differences in auditory and
visual transmission and processing speeds [18, 19]. Our pilot observations suggested that the
effects (both AV rabbit and the Invisible AV rabbit) are qualitatively and quantitatively very
similar between the two delay parameters, 23 ms and 0 ms.
Terminology
Sessions, blocks, trials, conditions, and experiments are used to identify the study parts and
sections. A session was each time a participant visited the laboratory to perform the experi-
ment, and most participants performed multiple sessions of experiments. Trials were each
time a stimulus was presented and the participant answered a question about that stimulus.
Blocks were each period of continuous sequential trials that are randomized in order. A major-
ity of sessions had multiple experimental blocks that were performed with breaks between
blocks as needed. Experiments were the scientific subparts of blocks, where a particular ques-
tion was posed and tested. Each block could have had one to two experiments contained in
each. A condition was a particular stimulus type (such as one beep and two flashes, (1b2f)) that
was presented in a random order within one block.
Most participants performed several sessions (i.e. laboratory visits) to complete the required
blocks. Experiment 1.3 contained trials with both left-to-right and right-to-left apparent
motion, but all other experiments contained only trials with left-to-right apparent motion. Ses-
sions that included Experiment 1.3 always started with that experiment (block 3, details below)
(so as to not bias participants towards one direction of apparent motion). All other blocks
were randomized in order within each session across participants, and trials within each block
were presented in random order.
Task
Participants responded using the keyboard and mouse. They reported the number of flashes
they perceived using the keys 1–4 on the number pad. In some blocks, after reporting the num-
ber of flashes, participants then reported the perceived location of each flash, using the mouse

 to move the cursor (which was presented as a bar) in the desired location, then clicking. When
reporting the flash location, the cursor started in the center of the screen (in the horizontal
direction). A visual bar located in the same position as the cursor, was used to report a loca-
tion, and therefore was also initially centered for location reporting. After the first location
question, the presentation of the bar for the next question was where the cursor was presented
at the end of the first question. For example, if the participant saw two flashes, a left flash and a
right flash, the following would occur. In the first question about location of the first flash, the
bar would start in the center and participant would move it to the left and click. The second
question would ask about the location of the second flash, and the bar would be initially pre-
sented on the left because that is where is was presented last. Participant would then move the
cursor over to the right and click. (Note: The initial cursor location was set to be at center of
the screen, so if a bias were generated by initial cursor location it would likely be toward the
center of the screen. Therefore, bias due to cursor position cannot explain the perceived loca-
tion of the flashes in the AV rabbit between the first and last flash location.)
In other blocks, participants reported both the number of flashes they perceived and rated
their confidence in their report (the options were: 1, 2, 3 and 4 where one was extremely confi-
dent and four was completely unsure). Auditory and visual stimuli were coded and responses
were recorded using MATLAB 2015b and Psychophysics Toolbox 3.0.
Stimulus types
The stimuli presented are diagrammed in Fig 2, which shows the relative timing of the audi-
tory and visual stimuli. The number of auditory beeps and visual flashes are indicated in the
text with the following format: NbMf. Where N is the number of auditory beeps and M is the
number of visual flashes. In these terms, the stimuli presented included: 0b2f (Fig 2B), 0b3f
(Fig 2E), 1b2f (Fig 2H), 2b2f (Fig 2C). 2b3f (Fig 2F and Fig 2I), 3b2f (Fig 2D), 3b3f (Fig 2G).
Specific experiment blocks
Block 1: Experiment 1.1 and Experiment 2.1 flash counting.
The participants (N = 7)
were presented with six conditions, consisting of (1) left flash, pause, right flash [0b2f, where
0b = 0 beeps, and 2f = 2 flashes, Fig 2B], (2) beep with left flash, pause, beep with right flash
[2b2f, Fig 2C], (3) beep with left flash, beep, beep with right flash [3b2f, Fig 2D], (4) left flash,
center flash, right flash [0b3f, Fig 2E], (5) beep with left flash, center flash, beep with right flash
[2b3f, Fig 2F], or (6) beep with left flash, beep with center flash, beep with right flash [3b3f, Fig
2G]. Each condition was presented 25 times within the experiment block. All flashes moved
left-to-right. The participants reported the number of flashes perceived (1–4) with the number
pad on a keyboard. Experiment 1.1 and 2.1 aimed to provide direct evidence for the illusory
rabbit (creation of an illusory visual flash by a beep) and the invisible rabbit (suppression of
physically present flash by the lack of a synchronous beep).
Block 2: Experiment 1.2 illusory rabbit location.
The participants (N = 8) were pre-
sented with four conditions, consisting of (1) left flash, pause, right flash [0b2f, Fig 2B], (2)
beep with left flash, pause, beep with right flash [2b2f, Fig 2C], (3) beep with left flash, beep,
beep with right flash [3b2f, Fig 2D], or (4) beep with left flash, beep with center flash, beep
with right flash [3b3f, Fig 2G]. Each condition was randomly selected and 100 trials in total
were presented during the block. All flashes moved left-to-right. The participants reported the

 number of flashes perceived with the number pad on a keyboard, and the location of each of
the perceived (1–4) flashes by clicking with a mouse. Experiment 1.2 aimed to provide evi-
dence for postdictive nature of illusory rabbit in terms of its location.
Block 3: Experiment 1.3 Prior knowledge of stimuli direction with location.
The partic-
ipants (N = 8) were presented were presented with six conditions, consisting of (1) left flash,
pause, right flash [0b2f, Fig 2B], (2) beep with left flash, pause, beep with right flash [2b2f, Fig
2C], (3) beep with left flash, beep, beep with right flash [3b2f, Fig 2D], or the three conditions
above with apparent motion from right to left. Each condition was presented 15 times within
the experiment block. Each trial’s flashes moved either left-to-right or right-to-left; the direc-
tion was randomized across trials and the first flash was always in the same, central location.
The final flash was presented at +/- 2.84 degrees. The participants reported the number of
flashes perceived (1–4) with the number pad on a keyboard, and the location of each of the
perceived flashes by clicking with a mouse. Experiment 1.3 aimed to further support the post-
dictive nature of the illusory rabbit identified in the previous experiment (1.2).
Block 4: Experiment 1.4 and Experiment 2.4 Eccentricity variation.
The participants
(N = 5) were presented with six conditions, consisting of (1) left flash, pause, right flash [0b2f,
Fig 2B], (2) beep with left flash, pause, beep with right flash [2b2f, Fig 2C], (3) beep with left
flash, beep, beep with right flash [3b2f, Fig 2D], (4) left flash, center flash, right flash [0b3f, Fig
2E], (5) beep with left flash, center flash, beep with right flash [2b3f, Fig 2F], or (6) beep with
left flash, beep with center flash, beep with right flash [3b3f, Fig 2G]. Each condition was pre-
sented 25 times within the experiment block. All flashes moved left-to-right. Each condition
was presented at three different eccentricities: near (4 degrees), middle (10 degrees), and far
(16 degrees). The participants reported the number of flashes perceived (1–4) with the number
pad on a keyboard. Experiment 1.4 and 2.4 aimed to determine if either of AV Rabbit illusions
vary in strength with eccentricity from fixation.
Block 5: Experiment 1.5 and Experiment 2.5 reported confidence of flash perception.
The participants (N = 8) were presented with six conditions, consisting of (1) left flash, pause,
right flash [0b2f, Fig 2B], (2) beep with left flash, pause, beep with right flash [2b2f, Fig 2C], (3)
beep with left flash, beep, beep with right flash [3b2f, Fig 2D], (4) left flash, center flash, right
flash [0b3f, Fig 2E], (5) beep with left flash, center flash, beep with right flash [2b3f, Fig 2F], or
(6) beep with left flash, beep with center flash, beep with right flash [3b3f, Fig 2G]. Each condi-
tion was presented 15 times within the experiment block. All flashes moved left-to-right. The
participants reported the number of flashes perceived (1–4) with the number pad on a key-
board and the confidence of the previous response (4 options). Experiment 1.5 and 2.5 aimed
to clarify the role of cognitive bias in the AV Rabbit illusions.
Block 6: Experiment 2.2 postdictiveness of the invisible rabbit.
The participants (N = 8)
were presented with three conditions, consisting of (1) beep with left flash, center flash [1b2f,
Fig H], (2) beep with left flash, center flash, beep with right flash [2b3f, Fig 2F], or (3) beep
with left flash, beep with center flash, right flash [2b3f, Fig 2I]. The condition 2 and 3 thus both
contained two beeps and three flashes, but varied whether the second beep was paired with the
final flash or the middle flash. Each condition was presented 25 times within the experiment
block. All flashes moved left-to-right. The participants reported the number of flashes per-
ceived (1–4) with the number pad on a keyboard. Experiment 2.2 aimed to provide evidence
for the role of postdiction in the invisible rabbit illusion.
Block 7: Experiment 2.3 invisible rabbit location.
The participants (N = 8) were pre-
sented with four conditions, consisting of (1) left flash, center flash, right flash [0b3f, Fig 2E],
(2) beep with left flash, beep with right flash [2b2f, Fig 2C], (3) beep with left flash, center flash,
beep with right flash [2b3f, Fig 2F], or (4) beep with left flash, beep with center flash, beep with
right flash [3b3f, Fig 2G]. Each condition was selected randomly for a total of 100 trials within

 the experiment block. All flashes moved left-to-right. The participants reported the number of
flashes perceived (1–4) with the number pad on a keyboard and the location of each of the per-
ceived flashes by clicking with a mouse. Experiment 2.3 aimed to investigate the flash locations
of the invisible rabbit illusion, in order to determine if the unperceived flash was either sup-
pressed or fused with another flash.
Results
Statistical approach
For each participant, the mean number and the standard deviation of perceived flashes were
calculated for each condition, and in many of the experiments, participants also reported per-
ceived location of the flashes; these data were aggregated based on how many flashes partici-
pated on a given trial. In several cases, assumptions underlying parametric statistics were
violated, so throughout our analyses, we used non-parametric statistics to test for differences
between conditions. Initial data processing was conducted using MATLAB; statistical analyses
were conducted using SPSS statistics. When recommended by SPSS (due to small number of
cases), we used exact p-values based on the binomial distribution. To facilitate comparisons
across experiments, we reported the standardized test statistic z wherever possible. Data are
available via the Open Science Framework.
Part 1: Illusory Audiovisual (AV) rabbit
Experiment 1.1 Illusory flashes (N = 7) (Block 1). The first step in investigating the Illu-
sory AV Rabbit is to show that an illusory flash is perceived due to the presence of a beep,
when that beep is preceded and followed by flash-beep pairs. Therefore, in the first experiment
participants recorded the number of flashes perceived when a variety of beep-flash stimuli are
presented (further experimental parameters are described in the methods section). Fig 3A
shows that the Illusory AV Rabbit (3b2f) stimulus caused participants to report perceiving
more flashes (Mdn = 2.52, M = 2.64, SD = 0.31) than an identical stimulus without the second
unpaired beep (2b2f) (Mdn = 2.04, M = 2.10, SD = 0.15). Both conditions showed significant
deviations from normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test, thus we used the Related-Samples Wil-
coxon Signed Rank Test to compare these conditions. This difference was statistically signifi-
cant (z = 2.536, p = 0.011, r = 0.634). Therefore, the presence of an unpaired beep (preceded
and followed by flash-beep pairs), is causing an illusory flash in the Illusory AV Rabbit (3b2f)
stimulus. This result was replicated by Experiment 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 (different participants), and 1.5,
which have different designs and goals but repeat the 3b2f (rabbit) and 2b2f conditions.
To further obtain converging statistical evidence, we conducted several additional analyses.
The difference between the number of flashes perceived in the 0b2f (Mdn = 2.24, M = 2.34,
SD = 0.31) and the 2b2f conditions was not statistically significant (z = 1.825, p = 0.068,
r = 0.456). We also conducted one-sample Wilcoxon Signed Rank Tests to compare each of
the three tested conditions to the veridical value of two flashes; in all three cases, the difference
in perceived flashes was statistically significant (3b2f: z = 2.536, p = 0.011, r = 0.0897; 0b2f:
z = 2.371, p = 0.018, r = 0.838; 2b2f: z = 2.032, p = 0.042, r = 0.718).
Finally, in order to confirm that the illusion strength was not substantially modulated by
repetitive experiences of the illusion we investigated if the illusory strength significantly varied
over the experimental duration (i.e. repetitions of trials). To test this, a direct comparison of
the first and last 50 trials (1/3 of the trials) for the Illusory AV Rabbit (3b2f) condition was per-
formed using the Related-Samples Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. There was no significant dif-
ference between the first and last third of the trials for the 3b2f Illusory AV Rabbit condition
(z = 0.676, p = 0.499, r = 0.169) or for the 2b2f condition (z = 0.000, p = 1.000, r = 0.000);

 however, there was a significant difference for the 0b2f condition (z = 2.383, p = 0.017,
r = 0.596), such that more flashes were reported in the first 50 trials (Mdn = 2.35, M = 2.46,

Experiment 1.1; participants reported seeing more flashes in the 3b2f condition (Mdn = 2.54,
M = 2.54, SD = 0.34) than in the 2b2f (Mdn = 2.00, M = 2.05, SD = 0.07) or 0b2f (Mdn = 2.18,
M = 2.20, SD = 0.19) conditions, though fewer than in the 3b3f condition (Mdn = 2.89,
M = 2.81, SD = 0.24). We used the Related-Samples Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test to compare
the 2b2f and 3b2f conditions, as these were the critical conditions for replicating our effect.
The difference between the 3b2f and 2b2f conditions was statistically significant, (z = 2.366,
p = 0.018, r = 0.592).
While the first experiment showed that an illusory flash is perceived in the Illusory AV Rab-
bit (3b2f), it did not indicate where that flash is located. This second experiment asks partici-
pants to report the number of flashes and then the locations of each of the flashes perceived.
The trials in which three flashes were perceived for the Illusory AV Rabbit (3b2f), were used to
generate a distribution of locations reported for each flash (Fig 3C). The veridical flashes were
located at positions of −1.42, and 1.42 degrees.
Of the eight participants who took part in this experiment, one participant did not ever
report seeing the illusory flash (this participant also reported seeing only two flashes on the
majority of trials in which three physical flashes were presented), and thus only data from the
other seven participants was analyzed for location. For each of the other participants, the mean
reported location of each flash was calculated for each condition. When three flashes were
reported, the reported positions of the first and third flashes were shifted substantially away
from the center, while the second flash was perceived to be located in the approximate center
of the two physical flashes. The median reported position (across observers) for the first flash
was -2.40 degrees (M = –2.63 degrees, SD = 1.19 degrees), the median reported position for the
second flash was −0.15 degrees (M = -0.50 degrees, SD = 0.97 degrees), and the mean reported
position for the third flash was 2.29 degrees (M = 2.47 degrees, SD = 0.96).
We used the Jonckheere-Tempstra test, which allows testing for an ordered pattern of
medians. This test does not take into account repeated measures, and thus is overly conserva-
tive for our design, but repeated measures tests such as Friedman’s ANOVA do not allow test-
ing for a particular hypothesis about order. In this case, we hypothesized that the second flash
would be perceived in between the veridical flashes. For center-to-right motion, each flash was
perceived further to the right than the prior flash (z = 4.478, p < 0.001, r = 0.978), with all pair-
wise comparisons significant. Thus, we conclude that the second flash was perceived to appear
at a different location from, and in between the first and third locations. This is suggestive that

 the Illusory AV Rabbit is postdictive in mechanism, as the third flash is not shown until after
the second stimulus is finished.
We conducted several additional analyses. The first of these analyses compared the reported
locations of the first and last flashes in the 3b2f condition in which an illusion was perceived
with those in which an illusion was not perceived. One participant saw the illusion on every
3b2f trial, and thus was excluded from this analysis. Every one of the six remaining participants
showed the same pattern of responses: reporting the first and last flash as further from the cen-
ter on trials in which they experienced an illusion than trials on which they didn’t experience
an illusion (see Table 1). Using the Related Samples Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test to compare
the locations, we found the difference was statistically significant (z = 2.524, p = 0.031,
r = 0.729).
Additional data analyses are included in the supplemental information.
Experiment 1.3: Prior knowledge of stimuli direction with location: A critical test for
postdictiveness (N = 8) (Block 3). For the number of flashes reported, the results were again
consistent with that of Experiment 1.1; participants often reported seeing three flashes in the
3b2f conditions (for center-to-left motion, Mdn = 2.80, M = 2.69, SD = 0.34 and for center-to-
right motion, Mdn = 2.73, M = 2.63, SD = 0.35), more frequently than in the 2b2f conditions
(for center-to-left motion, Mdn = 2.03, M = 2.04, SD = 0.05 and for center-to-right motion,
Mdn = 2.00, M = 2.05, SD = 0.08) and the 0b2f conditions (for center-to-left motion,
Mdn = 2.27, M = 2.29, SD = 0.23 and for center-to-right motion, Mdn = 2.20, M = 2.27,
SD = 0.21). Comparisons were made using the Related-Samples Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test;
for both directions, significantly more flashes were perceived in the 3b2f conditions than in
the 2b2f conditions (all p < 0.05).
In order to prevent prediction of the final flash location in the Illusory AV Rabbit, we ran-
domized the direction that the flashes moved. In Experiment 1.3, participants reported the
number of flashes perceived, and indicated the locations of those flashes, similar to Experiment
1.2.
Table 2 indicates the mean reported location of each flash (averaged across observers) for
the trials in which participants reported seeing three flashes (Table 1). Note that the veridical
locations of the first and final flash were at 0 and +/- 2.84 degrees.
Participants reported that the middle flash of the Illusory AV Rabbit (2b3f) was perceived
between the first and last flash, independent of the direction of flash movement. As with
Experiment 1.2, we used the Jonckheere-Tempstra test, which allows testing for an ordered
pattern of medians. This test does not take into account repeated measures, and thus is overly
conservative for our design, but repeated measures tests such as Friedman’s ANOVA do not
allow testing for a particular hypothesis about order. In this case, we hypothesized that the sec-
ond flash would be perceived in between the veridical flashes. For center-to-right motion, each
flash was perceived further to the right than the prior flash (z = 4.867, p < 0.001, r = 0.993),
with all pairwise comparisons significant. Similarly, for center-to-left motion, each flash was
perceived further to the left than the prior flash (z = -4.444, p < 0.001, r = -0.907), with all pair-
wise comparisons significant. Therefore, even when the location of the final flash is unpredict-
able, the second illusory flash is perceived between the final and first flashes. This direction
randomization further verifies that postdiction rather than prediction generates the Illusory
AV Rabbit.
Additional data analyses are included in the supplemental information.
Experiment 1.4: Eccentricity variation of the illusory AV rabbit (N = 5) (Block 4). It is
interesting to investigate if changes to the eccentricity of the visual stimulus impact the
strength of the Illusory AV Rabbit, as it does in similar illusions (such as the double flash illu-
sion) [18, 19]. We tested this hypothesis by varying the eccentricity of the flash location
Auditory visual multimodal postdiction

 between three locations (Near ~ 4 degrees, Middle ~ 10 degrees, Far ~ 16 degrees), where an
increase in eccentricity may decrease the visual signal to noise ratio. Participants reported the
number of flashes perceived. At all eccentricities, the Illusory AV Rabbit replicated successfully
in this new group of participants. We used the Related-Samples Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test to
separately test for the effect at each eccentricity by comparing the 3b2f conditions to the 2b2f
conditions, and found significant differences in all three cases (all p < 0.05), confirming the
replication of the illusion. We used Friedman’s ANOVA to test for differences in the effect size
by examining the number of flashes perceived in the 3b2f condition perceived at each of the
three locations; we found that, although there was a trend of increased illusion strength at the
farthest distance (near Mdn = 2.86 reported flashes, M = 2.64 reported flashes, SD = 0.41; mid-
dle Mdn = 2.80 reported flashes, M = 2.79 reported flashes, SD = .28; far Mdn = 3.00 reported
flashes, M = 2.88 reported flashes, SD = 0.25), the differences were not statistically significant,
X2
F(2) = 3.263, p = 0.196. These results indicate that the Illusory AV Rabbit could be resistant
to change across eccentricity (within the tested range); if true this would draw an interesting
contrast to similar illusions (such as the double flash illusion) which alter with eccentricity [18,
19]. Additional experiments with participant gaze verified by eye-tracking would further clar-
ify the impact of eccentricity.
Experiment 1.5: Reported confidence of flash perception (N = 7–8) (Block 5). It is
important to test if unconscious cognitive bias (by sounds) is not causing the perception of the
Illusory AV Rabbit. A confidence rating for the number of flashes perceived was used to verify
that bias did not likely generate the Illusory AV Rabbit. Our argument is that if the Illusory
Rabbit (in 3b2f) is due to ambiguity in the input signals and unconscious cognitive bias (by the
audible sounds), then the confidence level would be much less than the control conditions
with valid perception. Participants indicated how many flashes they saw and then rated their
confidence in that number.
Again, the basic illusory rabbit effect replicated; we used the Related-Samples Wilcoxon
Signed Rank Test and found that significantly more flashes were perceived in the 3b2f condi-
tion (Mdn = 2.43, M = 2.49, SD = 0.36) than in the 2b2f condition (Mdn = 2.00, M = 2.03,
SD = 0.03), z = 2.201, p = 0.028, r = 0.550. We compared trials on which participants reported
seeing three flashes and calculated the mean confidence rating for the 3b2f, 3b3f, and 0b3f con-
ditions so we could compare confidence ratings for the illusory flash to confidence ratings for
real flashes. One participant did not perceive the illusion, and did not report three flashes for
any trials in the 3b2f condition; we excluded that participant from the confidence analyses
(though not from the replication results above) and thus had a total of seven participants. Rat-
ings of confidence were similar for the 3b2f illusory flash condition (Mdn = 2.33, M = 2.26,
SD = 0.56, 95% CI = [1.75–2.78]) and the real flash conditions, both with beeps in the 3b3f con-
dition (Mdn = 2.33, M = 2.14, SD = 0.46, 95% CI = [1.71–2.57], and when the flashes were pre-
sented without beeps in the 0b3f condition (Mdn = 2.29, M = 2.32, SD = 0.35, 95% CI = 1.99–
2.64). We conducted a Friedman’s ANOVA and found no significant difference between the

 three conditions, X2
F(2) = 1.68, p = 0.43. If the reported illusory flashes were due to bias, is less
probable that the participants would report the same perceptual certainty for flashes they did
not actually “see”. While this does not rule out the potential that the experiment is statistically
underpowered, or there was cognitive misinterpretation of instructions, it does indicate that
there is a similarity in confidence between the illusion and a real perceptual stimulus.
In short, the Illusory AV rabbit is, at least in part, postdictive, and the current results point
to a lower-level mechanism (i.e. at a sensory-perceptual level, rather than a cognitive-level bias
or construct) contributing to this effect.
Part 2: Invisible Audiovisual (AV) rabbit
Experiment 2.1: Invisible rabbit flashes (N = 7) (Block 1). The first goal with the Invisi-
ble AV Rabbit is to show that a flash is not perceived when it is preceded and followed by
flash-beep pairs. Therefore, in the first Invisible AV Rabbit experiment, participants were
asked to report the number of flashes perceived. As shown in Fig 4A, in the 2b3f condition, sig-
nificantly fewer flashes were reported (Mdn = 2.36, M = 2.32, SD = 0.24) than in the 3b3f con-
dition (Mdn = 2.90, M = 2.91, SD = 0.10) or the 0b3f condition (Mdn = 2.96, M = 2.93,
SD = 0.19). We used a Related Samples Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test to compare the results of
the 2b3f and 3b3f conditions to see whether the absence of a second beep suppressed percep-
tion of a flash; this difference between the 2b3f and 3b3f conditions was significant (z = 2.524,
p = 0.012, r = 0.631). This comparison between 2b3f (Invisible AV Rabbit) and 3b3f indicates
the role of the beeps in flash suppression in 2b3f and that the fewer flashes perceived with 2b3f
was not merely due to difficulty with quick flash perception in the visual modality. Instead, the
flash suppression is due to a crossmodal effect resulting from the absence of a beep with the
second flash. This result was replicated by Experiment 2.3, 2.4 (different participants), and 2.5,
which have different designs and goals but repeat the 2b3f (invisible rabbit) and 3b3f
conditions.
We conducted several additional analyses to probe this effect. Using a Related Samples Wil-
coxon Signed Rank Test, we found that the difference between the 2b3f and 0b3f conditions
was significant (z = 2.524, p = 0.012, r = 0.631). We also compared the median response for
each of the three conditions to the veridical value of three flashes using a One-Sample Wil-
coxon Signed Rank Test. While the median perceived number of flashes in the 0b3f condition
did not significantly differ from 3 flashes (z = -0.775, p = 0.438, r = -0.274), it did significantly
differ from 3 flashes in both the 3b3f condition (z = -2.060, p = 0.039, r = -0.728 and the 2b3f
condition (z = -2.527, p = 0.012, r = -0.894).
Finally, in order to confirm that the illusion strength was not substantially modulated by
repetitive experiences of the illusion we investigated if the illusory strength significantly varied
over the experimental duration (i.e. repetitions of trials). To test this, a direct comparison of
the first and last 50 trials (1/3 of the trials) for the Invisible AV Rabbit (2b3f) condition was
performed using the Related-Samples Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. There was no significant
difference between the first and last third of the trials for the 2b3f Invisible AV Rabbit condi-
tion (z = 0.314, p = 0.753, r = 0.079), the 3b3f condition (z = 0.000, p = 1.000, r = 0, or the 0b3f
condition (z = -0.105, p = 0.917, r = 0.026).
Experiment 2.2: Postdictiveness of the invisible rabbit (N = 8) (Block 6). Experiment
2.1 indicated that the second flash of the Invisible AV Rabbit is not perceived. Yet is still
unclear if this is caused by the flash-beep pair before or the flash-beep after the flash in ques-
tion. If the flash-beep pair following the suppressed flash influences the suppression, then the
effect is likely postdictive in mechanism. To test this, participants indicated the number of
flashes perceived for a series of flash-beep configurations. Using the Related-Samples

 Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, it was found that participants perceived significantly fewer
flashes. (z = 2.207, p = 0.027, r = 0.552), for the Invisible AV Rabbit (2b3f, Fig 2F, Mdn = 2.20
M = 2.25, SD = 0.20) than for [beep-(left flash), beep-(center flash), right flash] (2b3f, Fig 2I,
Mdn = 2.48, M = 2.45, SD = 0.35), t(7) = 2.73, p = 0.0294, d = .96. Therefore, the lone flash is
suppressed the most if the beep-flash pairs are before and after the lone flash, rather than just
before. This indicates that postdictive processing significantly contributes to the suppression
of the lone flash in the Invisible AV Rabbit. In the 1b2f condition, participants perceived fewer
than 2 flashes (Mdn = 1.62, M = 1.64. SD = .33); a One-Sample Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test
found that this was significantly different from the veridical value of 2 flashes (z = 2.207,
p = 0.027, r = 0.780).
Prediction, in addition to postdiction, seems to contribute to suppression of the lone flash.
Comparing perception in the 0b3f condition (M = 2.93 flashes, measured in Experiment 2.1)
to the number of flashes reported for the 2b3f condition where the lone flash is last (M = 2.45
flashes), shows that adding beeps to the first two flashes diminishes the perception of flashes.
Therefore, the difference between these two conditions indicates that there is a predictive sup-
pression of the third flash due to the multimodal pairing of the first two beep-flash pairs. How-
ever, the predictive element to the stimulus processing does not obviate postdiction from
also playing a role. The comparison between the 2b3f condition where the lone flash is last
(M = 2.45 flashes) to the 2b3f condition when the lone flash is second (M = 2.25 flashes) is to
this point. This comparison shows a further significant decrement in the number of flashes
perceived beyond the decrement generated by prediction. Therefore, postdiction and predic-
tion both contribute to the Invisible AV Rabbit.
Experiment 2.3: Invisible rabbit location (N = 8) (Block 7). Results of the previous
Experiment (2.2) show that the beep-flash pair must follow the lone flash for the strongest
Invisible AV Rabbit effect. However, two potential mechanisms could cause this reduction in
flash perception: the suppression of a flash, or the fusion of two flashes. In this experiment par-
ticipants are asked to report the location of the two flashes they perceive with the Invisible AV
Rabbit Illusion (2b3f, Fig 2F). If suppression is occurring, then the two reported flash locations
should be centered on the veridical location of the first and last real flashes (second flash sup-
pressed). If fusion is occurring, then the first or second perceived flash should be centered
between the veridical location of the first and second or second and third real flashes.
This dataset successfully replicated the invisible rabbit effect. We used the Related-Samples
Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test and found that participants reported seeing significantly fewer
flashes when separately compared to the 2b3f condition (Mdn = 2.11, M = 2.19, SD = 0.23)
than in the 3b3f condition (Mdn = 2.88, M = 2.88, SD = 0.11), and to the 0b3f condition
(Mdn = 2.71, M = 2.73, SD = 0.030); for both comparisons, z = 2.521, p = 0.012, r = 0.630. In
the 2b2f condition, participants almost always reported seeing two flashes (Mdn = 2.02,
M = 2.04, SD = 0.06).
We analyzed the reported positions of the flashes for the 2b3f trials in which participants
reported seeing two flashes. As shown in Fig 4C, participants perceived an initial flash close to
the location of the first veridical flash, and perceived the subsequent flash close to the location
of the third veridical flash. The veridical flashes were located at positions of −1.42, 0, and 1.42
degrees. One-sample Wilcoxon Signed Rank Tests were used to compare the locations of the
reported flashes to the veridical locations of the flashes. The median reported position for the
first flash was -1.52 degrees (M = −1.83, SD = 0.82), which was not significantly different from
−1.42 degrees (z = -0.980, p = 0.327, r = 0.346), but was significantly different from 0 degrees
(z = -2.521, p = 0.012, r = -0.891). The median reported position for the second flash was 1.57
degrees (M = 1.42, SD = 0.61), which was significantly different from 0 degrees (z = 2.521,
p = 0.012, r = 0.891) and not from 1.42 degrees (z = 0.700, p = 0.484, r = 0.247). In other words,

 the lack of beep paired with the second veridical flash suppresses its perception, with its loca-
tion information also suppressed or lost (rather than merged into the first or the third
location).
Experiment 2.4: Eccentricity variation of the invisible rabbit (N = 5) (Block 4). The
sensitivity of the Invisible AV Rabbit to the eccentricity of the visual stimulus relative to fixa-
tion was investigated. In particular, it was expected that the illusion may be stronger at farther
eccentricities, where vision has a lower spatial resolution which may allow audition to domi-
nate vision more readily (as in the double flash illusion). We tested this hypothesis by varying
the eccentricity of the flash location between three locations (Near ~ 4 degrees, Middle ~ 10
degrees, Far ~ 16 degrees), where an increase in eccentricity decreases the visual signal-to-
noise ratio. At all eccentricities, the Invisible AV Rabbit replicated successfully in this new
group of participants. We used the Related-Samples Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test to separately
test for the effect at each eccentricity by comparing the 2b3f conditions to the 3b3f conditions,
and found significant differences in all three cases (all p < 0.05), confirming the replication of
the illusion. We used Friedman’s ANOVA to test for differences in the effect size by examining
the number of flashes perceived in the 2b3f condition. We found that, consistent with experiment
1.4, there was a trend of increased illusion strength at the farthest distance (near Mdn = 2.18
reported flashes, M = 2.32 reported flashes, SD = 0.39; middle Mdn = 2.18 reported flashes,
M = 2.20 reported flashes, SD = 0.23; far Mdn = 2.05 reported flashes, M = 2.13 reported flashes,
SD = 0.16), but this difference was not statistically significant, X2
F(2) = 5.158, p = 0.076. The
results indicate that the Invisible AV Rabbit could be robust across eccentricity, drawing an inter-
esting contrast to similar illusions (such as the double-flash illusion) which have a significant
alteration with eccentricity [18, 19].
Experiment 2.5: Reported confidence of flash perception (N = 8) (Block 5). A confi-
dence rating experiment was used next to indicate if unconscious bias generated the percep-
tion of the Invisible AV Rabbit. Participants indicated how many flashes they saw and then
rated their confidence in that number.
Again, the basic invisible rabbit effect replicated; we used the Related-Samples Wilcoxon
Signed Rank Test, and found that significantly fewer flashes were perceived in the 2b3f condi-
tion (Mdn = 2.73, M = 2.24, SD = 0.29) than in the 3b3f condition (Mdn = 2.90, M = 2.89,
SD = 0.12), (z = 2.524, p = 0.012, r = 0.631). We compared participants’ confidence that they
perceived two flashes in the invisible 2b3f condition (Mdn = 1.93, M = 1.95, SD = 0.64, 95%
CI = [1.41–2.48]) to the confidence they had for the perception of two real flashes in the 0b2f
(Mdn = 1.81, M = 1.87, SD = 0.57, 95% CI = [1.40–2.35]) and 2b2f conditions (Mdn = 1.69,
M = 1.74, SD = 0.55, 95% CI = [1.28–2.20])(Fig 4B). We conducted a Friedman’s ANOVA
comparing the confidence ratings for trials in which participants reported seeing two flashes
for the three different conditions. There was no significant difference in confidence ratings
between the perception of an absent flash and a suppressed flash (X2
F(2) = 1.00, p = 0.607). If
the Invisible AV Rabbit were due to bias, is improbable that the participants would report the
same confidence for a biased response that is not perceptual, as a real perceptual stimulus.
Therefore, similarity in confidence between the illusion and a real perceptual stimulus indi-
cates that the illusion is likely perceptual as well.
Discussion
Illusory AV rabbit
The Illusory AV Rabbit effect demonstrated the creation of a new illusory visual percept by a
particular sequence of auditory-visual events. In particular, a spatial shift of an illusory flash

 was induced by a flash-beep pair following it (Fig 1A shows the Illusory AV Rabbit stimulus
sequence: flash-beep, beep, flash-beep).
In the Illusory AV Rabbit effect an illusory flash is generated at the time of the second beep
(shown in Experiment 1.1). The illusory flash is perceived second in the perceptual sequence
and the location of the illusory flash is perceived mid-way between the first and last flash
(shown in Experiment 1.2). When the direction of the flash movement is randomized between
left-to-right and right-to-left, thus no prior knowledge on the direction of apparent motion
was available, the illusory flash is still perceived centered between the first and last flash (Exper-
iment 1.3). This randomization result confirms that postdiction (instead of prediction based
on prior knowledge on the direction of motion) generates the spatial shift in the illusory flash
toward the last flash. If the distance between the flashes and fixation point (i.e. eccentricity of
the stimulus set) is varied, the illusory flash in the Illusory AV Rabbit is still perceived (even at
approximately 4 degrees from fixation) indicating a potential robustness relative to signal-to-
noise changes between the peripheral and central visual perception (Experiment 1.4). In other
words, the visual perception may not be required to be in the periphery (and therefore noisy)
in order for audition to alter it in the Illusory AV Rabbit. Finally, the Illusory AV Rabbit was
shown to be likely a perceptual effect, as opposed to a cognitive effect, judging from the result
of the confidence rating experiment, where the illusory flash perception was perceived with
the same confidence as a real flash (Experiment 1.5).
The experiments for the Illusory AV Rabbit indicate that an illusory flash is positioned post-
dictively between a previous and future flash location. It indicates that audition can modify the
location of a visual percept via postdictive processing.
Invisible AV rabbit
The Invisible AV Rabbit occurs when a real flash is suppressed by the presence of a beep-flash
pair following it (Fig 1B). The Invisible AV Rabbit stimulus sequence starts with a flash-beep,
then a flash, and another flash-beep, where the second flash is not perceived (Experiment 2.1),
and suppression of the second flash is caused by the presence of the last flash-beep pair.
(Experiment 2.2). Furthermore, the last flash and second flash are not fused, as when the flash
locations are reported the last flash location is centered at actual last flash location, and not
between the second and last flash (Experiment 2.3). If the distance from the flash location to
the fixation point (i.e. eccentricity of the stimulus set) is varied, the Invisible AV Rabbit seems
to occur at up to approximately 4 degrees from fixation, indicating that even with a stronger
visual signal (and less noise), audition can dominate over vision (Experiment 2.4). Finally, the
Invisible AV Rabbit was found to be perceptual, as opposed to cognitive or inferential, by hav-
ing similar confidence rating between the Invisible AV Rabbit perception, and real flash per-
ception (Experiment 2.5).
The experiments for the Invisible AV Rabbit indicate that a real flash is suppressed by the
presence of a beep-flash pair preceding and following it. It indicates that audition can postdic-
tively suppress visual perception.
Models of postdictive processing
Models of postdictive brain processes include proposed computational encoding mechanisms
[16], neural mechanisms of information flow [1], and neural processing implications to visual
awareness [15].
The computational approach was used by Goldreich and Tong (2013), to model the joint
role of postdiction and prediction in perceptual effects by using a Bayesian low-speed prior.
This model was used successfully to explain the cutaneous rabbit illusion [16], by assuming
Auditory visual multimodal postdiction

 that the brain expects objects to move slowly (low-speed prior). In particular, two tactile taps
on the forearm in separate locations are perceived to move a shorter distance than reality (a
“length contraction”) due to the noisy position perception and the assumption the object
moved slowly. Further experiments will have to be performed to test the applicability of Gold-
reich’s model to the AV Rabbit. Additional AV Rabbit experiments with variation in the sec-
ond beep onset, would detail the relationship between the second beep timing and the
reported illusory flash location. In particular, these types of experiments (with variation in the
second beep onset) would indicate if the flash position is “contracted” in its position relative to
the beep timing.
Shimojo (2014) described several neuroscientific models, where the information from a
later stimulus could be integrated with a previous stimulus within the sensory processing path-
way. In addition to the “catch-up” model detailed in the introduction of this paper, Shimojo
proposed several other unimodal postdictive mechanisms, including differential processing
speeds in different neural layers and/or back-projection of “fast” signals from a higher layer to
a lower layer within one modality. These types of models based on brain architecture and path-
ways can be easily adapted to a multisensory stimulus. Models for multimodal postdiction
include differential neural pathway processing speeds between visual and auditory processing
(a modified “catch-up model”), feedback of previous stimuli information from multisensory
regions to primary sensory regions and then feedforward of the integrated stimuli (feedback-
feedforward model), and slower integration times in multisensory regions relative to the pri-
mary sensory regions (a different variation of the “catch-up” model). Multisensory postdiction
increases the likely number of brain regions involved in postdictive processes, incorporating
multisensory regions as well as multiple primary sensory regions (such as audition or vision).
As such, the incorporation of multisensory postdiction both increases the types of models pos-
sible, and also makes them more specific to crossmodal integration (rather than possibly
occurring in any single sensory system).
Finally, the visual awareness explanation or model [15] argues that perceptual postdiction
originates from the observation that visual awareness does not occur in real time but rather is
delayed and typically requires re-entry or feedback. This allows for an event up to about 80 ms
following a stimulus to affect the perception of that stimulus. This type of perceptual process-
ing model is also implicitly assumed within the neuroscientific models detailed above. Cer-
tainly, the results in this paper indirectly support this concept as an underlying but necessary
principle for multisensory postdictive processing.
Relation to multisensory integration and crossmodal interactions
Predictive models and illusions have largely dominated multisensory interactions; they include
effects such as speeded audio-visual cuing, temporal ventriloquism, the McGurk Effect audi-
tory-visual language illusion, and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) in multisensory
integration [20–27]. The brain seems to be using prior information stored about each modal-
ity, as well as direct attention, to integrate multimodal cues and effectively predict future sti-
muli. The AV rabbit is not fully explained by these predictive models of audiovisual
interaction. In particular, our control experiments indicate that the sensory information pre-
sented before the illusory flash is not sufficient to move the illusory flash toward the final flash
location. However, the necessity of postdiction to explain the illusory flash location, does not
mean that temporal ventriloquism, sensory uncertainty, and MLE do not contribute to gener-
ating the illusory flash, binding the auditory-visual stimuli, and generating the perceived
audiovisual timing. In effect, the AV rabbit is an excellent example of a multimodal illusion
that relies both on predictive processing, as well postdictive processing within the sensory

 regions of the brain (as indicated in experiments 1.2, 1.3, and 2.2). Our main claim is that in
addition to predictive processing, postdiction is also necessary to fully explain this illusion.
Neuroscience research has begun to investigate the emerging area of multimodal postdic-
tion, where later stimuli can affect prior stimuli. In fact, a study showed that the flash-lag effect,
which is modeled as postdictive (at least in some theories), can occur crossmodally, or audio-
visually [10]. The AV Rabbit Illusions add to this growing body of postdictive effects bridging
the senses, and point to a new mechanism for sensory combination within short perceptual
time scales. As the number of instances of crossmodal postdiction increases, the neural pro-
cessing underlying postdictive interactions may become more clear, and thereby broaden the
types of processing within the sensory regions of the brain. Furthermore, such crossmodal
cases may further bridge the gap between lower-level, unimodal sensory postdiction and
higher-level, long-term, cognitive postdiction [1, 26]. In addition, one may speculate that such
postdictive processes are universal across various time-scales and various parts/spatial scales of
the brain, and they evolved due to a biological advantage of saving memory and yet having pre-
dictive power for the future.
The AV Rabbit illusions also highlight an effect where audition dominates over visual per-
ception. Auditory dominance over vision is relatively unusual; the majority of crossmodal illu-
sions in the normally sighted show that vision modulates audition, especially spatially (such as
the ventriloquist effect and McGurk effect [26]). The Colavita effect is an example of visual
dominance over audition [28]. In this effect, participants are asked to respond as quickly as
possible to indicate whether a flash or beep stimulus was presented. Oddball trials, explained
to the participants as equipment malfunctions, presented a flash and beep simultaneously. Par-
ticipants typically respond to the bimodal stimulus with predominantly the visual flash
response button. The reason that the Colavita effect has visual dominance and the AV Rabbit
illusions do not, may rest on the duration of the visual flash, which is significantly longer in
the Colavita stimulus (typically over 150 ms, as the stimulus was presented until the participant
response was registered) than the duration of the flash in the AV Rabbit illusions (20 ms). The
longer flash in the Colavita stimulus likely increases the reliability of vision relative audition,
and may lead to more visual dominance [22]. The short duration of the flash in the AV Rabbit
illusions makes the visual percept shorter, noisier, and therefore less likely to be dominant. A
very short visual stimulus duration (or alternatively high visual frequency) is a unifying princi-
ple for illusions with auditory dominance over vision, with the double flash illusion [18–19],
and Shipley’s flicker-flutter effect [27] both using this domain. In addition, the Colavita effect
is performed as a dual task, where the participant has to respond to a bimodal stimulus as a
flash (one button press) or a beep (a different button). This type of competition between two
types of tasks does not occur in our AV rabbit illusions, in which participants are instructed to
ignore the number of beeps presented [29]. Finally, the AV Rabbit illusion contains a sequence
of beeps and flashes, in which the stimuli before and after the illusory stimulus are influential
to the illusion perceived. The Colavita effect has only one beep and/or flash without a sequence
of stimuli.
Relation to the double flash illusion
The AV Rabbit Illusions in many ways build upon the Double Flash Illusion discovered by
Shams and colleagues [18–19]. The Double Flash Illusion indicated that a quick flash can be
doubled by pairing it with two short beeps. The AV Rabbit uses the initial double flash para-
digm to generate the second illusory flash, but further influences the location of that illusory
flash via a second real shifted flash. Furthermore, the Invisible AV Rabbit indicates that the
opposite of the Double Flash can occur; a visual flash can be suppressed by audition, rather

 than generated. These new AV Rabbit Illusions show that the auditory-to-visual interaction is
not just an excitatory connection between the senses, but rather the auditory influence on
vision can also cause suppression, and spatial displacement. This type of fine-tuned interaction
portrays a multisensory integration that is specific to the type of information conveyed across
the senses. Multisensory cortical regions may play a key role in this fine-tuned cross-sensory
processing, and could be directly influencing visual cortex through feedback connections [30–
33].
