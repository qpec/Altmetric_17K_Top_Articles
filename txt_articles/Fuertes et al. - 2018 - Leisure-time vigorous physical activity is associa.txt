Objective We assessed associations between physical 
activity and lung function, and its decline, in the 
prospective population-based european community 
respiratory Health Survey cohort.
Methods FeV1 and FVc were measured in 3912 
participants at 27–57 years and 39–67 years (mean 
time between examinations=11.1 years). Physical 
activity frequency and duration were assessed using 
questionnaires and used to identify active individuals 
(physical activity ≥2 times and ≥1 hour per week) at 
each examination. adjusted mixed linear regression 
models assessed associations of regular physical activity 
with FeV1 and FVc.
Results Physical activity frequency and duration 
increased over the study period. in adjusted models, 
active individuals at the first examination had higher 
FeV1 (43.6 ml (95% ci 12.0 to 75.1)) and FVc (53.9 ml 
(95% ci 17.8 to 89.9)) at both examinations than their 
non-active counterparts. these associations appeared 
restricted to current smokers. in the whole population, 
FeV1 and FVc were higher among those who changed 
from inactive to active during the follow-up (38.0 ml 
(95% ci 15.8 to 60.3) and 54.2 ml (95% ci 25.1 to 
83.3), respectively) and who were consistently active, 
compared with those consistently non-active. no 
associations were found for lung function decline.
Conclusion leisure-time vigorous physical activity was 
associated with higher FeV1 and FVc over a 10-year 
period among current smokers, but not with FeV1 and 
FVc decline.
InTROduCTIOn
Low lung function is an important phenotypic 
trait of COPD, a condition responsible for nearly 
64 million disability-adjusted life-years lost glob-
ally.1 Lung function naturally declines with age, 
and this decline is known to be modified by only 
a few factors (eg, tobacco smoking,2 mould expo-
sure3 and α1-antitrypsin levels4). The confirmed 
identification of physical activity as a common 
modifiable factor able to attenuate age-related 
lung function decline could lead to significant 
public health benefits.
Physical inactivity is a leading risk factor for 
global mortality5 and is strongly linked to several 
major non-communicable diseases.6 Interest-
ingly, the evidence for a link with respiratory 
health is weaker, possibly as most previous 
studies were cross-sectional and thus subject to 
reverse causation, or because they focused on 
specific populations (eg, athletes, patients with 
COPD). The few existing prospective studies 
suggest a beneficial link between physical 
activity and respiratory health, although results 
are inconsistent in terms of subgroups affected 
and indicators of physical activity.7–12 Some of 
these inconsistencies could be due to selection 
bias (eg, use of a convenience sample9), lack 
of confounder adjustment (eg, socioeconomic 
status) or because changes in physical activity 
levels over time were not considered.13 One 
study on over 6000 adults living in Copenhagen, 
Key messages
What is the key question?
 
► Is physical activity associated with higher lung 
function and reduced lung function decline over 
a 10-year period among European adults?
What is the bottom line?
 
► Leisure-time vigorous physical activity was 
associated with higher maximum FEV1and FVC 
over a 10-year period among current smokers, 
but not with reduced decline in these lung 
function parameters.
Why read on?
 
► This study, which is based on data collected 
over a 10-year period as part of the prospective 
European ECRHS cohort, strengthens the 
epidemiological evidence supporting a positive 
association between physical activity and 
respiratory health in smokers.

Respiratory epidemiology
Denmark, adequately assessed these factors and reported that 
higher physical activity was associated with less lung function 
decline and a lower COPD risk in active smokers only.10 11 
This observation has not yet been replicated.
The European Community Respiratory Health Survey 
(ECRHS) is a three-phase, longitudinal, multicentre study that 
collected detailed information on environmental, lifestyle and 
respiratory health factors from adults living across Europe.14 We 
used this rich data source to assess whether vigorous physical 
activity is associated with higher maximum FEV1 and FVC, and 
a reduced rate of FEV1 and FVC decline, in 3912 adults from 25 
centres in 11 countries. Further, we tested the hypothesis that 
this relationship may be stronger among active smokers.10
MeThOds
study population
The ECRHS was initiated in 1991–1993 (ECRHS I), when over 
18 
000 young adults (20–44 years-old) were randomly recruited 
from available population-based registers (population-based 
arm), with an oversampling of asthmatics (symptomatic arm). 
T
wo examinations (at 27–57 years (ECRHS II, 1999–2003) and 
39–67 years (ECRHS III, 2010–2014)) have since taken place. 
Details of the study design are available.15 16 The current analysis 
uses data collected during ECRHS II and III, hereon referred to 
as the first and second examinations. A total of 3912 participants 
(25 centres in 11 countries) had information on lung function 
at both time points, physical activity at the first follow-up and 
base covariates (sex, age, height and smoking), and are therefore 
included in the present study. We analysed data from both the 
population-based and symptomatic arms of the ECRHS as our 
aim was to examine associations with physical activity and not to 
estimate incidence rates or prevalences in a representative popu-
lation.17 A flow chart is provided in online supplementary figure 
S1. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.
Lung function
Lung function was assessed using different spirometers across 
centres at the first examination, whereas nearly all centres 
used the same spirometer at the second examination (online 
supplementary table S1). For both time points, FEV1 and FVC, 
repeatable to 150 
mL from at least two of a maximum of five 
correct manoeuvres that met the American Thoracic Society 
recommendations,18 were used as the primary outcomes. The 
FEV1/FVC 
ratio was considered as a secondary outcome. COPD 
incidence was not considered as an outcome due to an insuffi-
cient number of cases. All lung function measures were taken 
prebronchodilation.
Vigorous physical activity
Leisure-time vigorous physical activity was estimated by asking 
participants how often (frequency) and for how many hours per 
week (duration) they usually exercised so much that they got out 
of breath or sweaty,19 using previously validated questions.20 21 
The responses for frequency were every day, 4–6 times a week, 
2–3 times a week, once a week, once a month, less than once a 
month and never. For statistical analyses, we grouped together 
the first two categories, the next two categories and the last three 
categories. The responses for duration were 7 
hours or more, 
about 4–6 
hours, about 2–3 
hours, about 1 
hour, about half an 
hour and none. For statistical analyses, we grouped together the 
first two categories, the next two categories and the last two 
categories. At each time point, individuals were categorised as 
being active if they exercised with a frequency of two or more 
times a week (‘2–3 times a week’ or greater) and with a duration 
of about 1 
hour a week or more, and non-active otherwise (as 
done previously in the ECRHS22 and by others23). Change in 
activity status was categorised into four groups: non-active at 
both examinations, became inactive, became active and active at 
both examinations.
Other relevant characteristics
Data on sociodemographic and clinical factors, and other lung 
function risk factors, were collected using questionnaires. These 
included sex, age, smoking status (never smoker; ex-smoker 
with <15 
pack-years; ex-smoker with ≥15 pack-years; current 
smoker with <15 pack-years; current smoker with ≥15 pack-
years or more), second-hand smoke exposure (yes; no), age 
completed full-time education (<17 years; 17–20 years; >20 
years), 
occupation 
(management/professional/non-manual; 
technical/professional/non-manual; other non-manual; skilled 
manual; semiskilled/unskilled manual; other/unknown, classi-
fied according to the International Standard Classification of 
Occupations-88 code24), asthma (yes; no) and report of a comor-
bidity associated with inflammation with a potential influence 
on physical activity (yes: arthritis/hypertension/heart disease/
diabetes/cancer/stroke; no: none of these). Height and weight 
were measured.
statistical analysis
Associations between the physical activity and lung function 
metrics were estimated using multivariable mixed linear regres-
sion models with random intercepts for subjects nested within 
centres (lme4 package25 in the statistical program R, V
.3.3.026). 
Statistical significance was set at P<0.05.
T
wo modelling approaches were performed. First, to assess the 
prospective impact of physical activity on lung function over a 
10-year period, associations between physical activity frequency, 
duration and activity status assessed at the first examination with 
lung function assessed at both examinations were examined. An 
interaction term between the physical activity parameter and 
time between examinations was included to capture the effect 
of the physical activity parameter on the rate of lung function 
decline. The following variables were entered as covariates: 
sex, age, age-squared (to account for the non-linear relationship 
between lung function and age27), education, occupation (both 
entered as the value assessed at the first examination), height, 
weight, smoking status and second-hand smoke exposure (all 
entered as the values assessed at the two different examinations). 
Numeric variables were centred (over the data from both exam-
inations) before modelling.
Second, to assess the impact of changes in physical activity 
on lung function, associations between changes in activity 
status between the two examinations and lung function at the 
second examination were modelled. The same confounders 
were included, but all were entered as the value assessed at the 
first examination to control for variation at the beginning of the 
study. Numeric variables were centred over the data at the first 
examination. To account for potential ‘regression to the mean’ 
effects,28 the models were additionally adjusted for lung function 
at the first examination.
To assess effect modification, the primary models for FEV1 
and FVC were stratified by sex, median age of the study sample, 
smoking status (never, former, current), body mass index 
(BMI: <25 
kg/m2; 25–30 
kg/m2; >30 
kg/m2), asthma and report 
of a comorbidity (latter data only available for 19 out of 25 
centres), as assessed at the first examination. Models stratified

by smoking status were adjusted for lifetime pack-years smoked 
(not applicable for never smokers).
We performed several sensitivity analyses. Asthmatics, those 
with current respiratory symptoms (wheezing and whistling 
in the chest or woken up with a feeling of tightness, short-
ness of breath or by an attack of coughing, all in the last 12 
months), those with COPD (FEV1/FVC less than the lower 
limit 
of the normal predicted using the Global Lung Initiative equa-
tions29), those avoiding vigorous exercise because of wheezing 
or asthma, and those who took inhaled medication to help 
breathing in the last 12 months, all assessed at the first examina-
tion, were excluded in separate analyses. We also examined the 
impact of excluding those from the symptomatic ECRHS study 
arm and those with lung function changes greater than 100 
mL/
year. In a further sensitivity analysis, BMI was included in the 
model instead of weight. We also removed lung function at first 
examination as an adjustment variable in the second modelling 
approach, as has been suggested.30 Finally, we adjusted all models 
for lung function at ECRHS baseline (measured 10 years prior to 
the collection of the physical activity data) to more completely 
assess potential reverse causation.
ResuLTs
study characteristics
Compared with those with information at the first examination 
(n=7518), individuals included in this analysis were slightly 
older and less likely to smoke, be exposed to second-hand 
smoke and report asthma. However, they were more likely to 
have higher FEV1 values at the first examination, higher educa-
tion and work in a managerial position. Descriptive statistics of 
the study population are presented in tables 1 and 2. FEV1 at

the second examination was significantly lower among current 
smokers compared with never smokers, as identified at the first 
examination (mean FEV1 was 2951 
mL and 3058 
mL among 
current and never smokers, respectively; Student’s t-test P value 
<0.001). In addition, declines of both FEV1 and FVC were 
significantly greater among current smokers than never smokers 
(FEV1 declines were −46.9 
mL/year and −40.4 
mL/year among 
current and never smokers, respectively; Student’s t-test P value 
<0.001; and FVC declines were −36.8 
mL/year and −32.3 
mL/
year among current and never smokers, respectively; Student’s 
t-test P value=0.004). Men (27.9%) and non-asthmatics (25.6%) 
were more likely to be current smokers than women (22.4%) 
and asthmatics (22.2%). Vigorous physical activity frequency 
and duration, as well as the percentage of individuals considered 
active, increased over the 10-year follow-up period (table 3).
Associations between vigorous physical activity levels and 
lung function measurements
Active individuals at the first examination had higher FEV1 
and FVC on average at both examinations than their non-ac-
tive counterparts (table 4 for the results for the physical activity 
parameters, and online supplementary tables S2 and S3 for the 
results for all other covariates). There was no independent asso-
ciation between physical activity and the rate of FEV1 or FVC 
decline (table 4). The mean FVC was positively associated with 
frequency and duration of physical activity (table 4), whereas the 
mean FEV1/FVC ratio appeared negatively associated with both 
of these factors (online supplementary table S4).
Stratification by smoking status revealed that the associations 
with FEV1 and FVC were only apparent among current smokers 
(figure 1; effect estimates and model sample sizes for FEV1 and 
FVC are presented in online supplementary tables S5 and S6, 
respectively). Associations stratified by asthma (online supple-
mentary figure S2), comorbidities (online supplementary figure 
S3) and age (online supplementary figure S4) were driven by 
the current smokers in each of the respective groups. Removing 
participants with current respiratory symptoms (48.3%) led to 
the attenuation of the associations.
Associations appeared stronger for men than for women 
(online supplementary table S7), whereas those stratified by BMI 
did not reveal a consistent pattern (online supplementary tables 
S8 and S9 for FEV1 and FVC, respectively). Adjusting the models 
for BMI instead of weight, as well as excluding those with 
COPD, those avoiding vigorous exercise because of wheezing or 
asthma or those taking inhalation medication to help breathing 
in the last 12 months did not alter the general conclusions (not 
shown). Further, excluding the ECRHS symptomatic study arm 
or those with FEV1 and FVC declines greater than 100 
mL/year 
also did not affect the results (not shown). Adjusting the models 
for lung function at ECRHS baseline (assessed 10 years prior 
to the collection of the physical activity data) did attenuate the 
effect estimates, although this may be the result of an overadjust-
ment of the models (online supplementary table S10).
Change in vigorous physical activity and lung function at the 
second examination
With respect to subjects who were non-active at both occasions, 
subjects who became or remained active during the follow-up 
period had higher FEV1 and FVC at the second examination 
(figure 2). Results were similar both with and without adjust-
ment for lung function at the first examination, as well as with 
adjustment for lung function at ECRHS baseline (online supple-
mentary table S10). None of the sensitivity analyses conducted 
greatly affected these associations.
dIsCussIOn
From this work, we can draw four conclusions: (1) Leisure-time 
vigorous physical activity seems to be associated with higher 
FEV1 and FVC. (2) These associations were only apparent among 
current smokers. (3) There was no indication that vigorous phys-
ical activity attenuated the rate of FEV1 and FVC decline in this 
age group. (4) Increasing physical activity from non-active to 
active during the follow-up was associated with higher FEV1 and 
FVC.
Interpretation
There are three potential mechanisms to explain an association 
between physical activity and lung function. First, it is increas-
ingly accepted that regular physical activity has long-term 
systemic anti-inflammatory effects that can be mediated through 
the induction of an anti-inflammatory environment within the 
body.31 Our results are in line with this explanation as associa-
tions were only apparent among current smokers (a population 
subgroup with a high inflammatory burden), an observation that 
has been reported by some10 but not all8 previous epidemiolog-
ical studies. Associations simultaneously stratified by disease 
status (asthma, comorbidity) and smoking status, as well as by 
age group and smoking status, revealed that associations were 
largely seen among the current smokers in all groups. A higher 
proportion of current smokers was also apparent among men, 
which may explain why associations appeared slightly stronger 
for this group compared with women. Future studies that link 
physical activity to improved lung function using biological 
markers of systemic inflammation are needed to more fully 
explore anti-inflammation as a potential mechanism.

Respiratory epidemiology
Notably, we did not observe consistent associations between 
physical activity and lung function among asthmatics, another 
high-inflammation group. This result is in contrast to a recent 
study in which there appeared to be less decline in FEV1, FEV1/
FVC and peak expiratory flow among physically active asth-
matics compared with non-active asthmatics.12 The fact that 
asthmatics and other sick populations are challenging to analyse 
as they may limit their physical activity due to various reasons, 
such as physical activity-induced respiratory symptoms, may 
explain the inconsistency between the results of the current 
study and previous ones.
A second pathway by which increased physical activity may lead 
to higher lung function is via beneficial changes in body compo-
sition and fat distribution, which can affect lung mechanics32 and 
be linked to low-grade systemic inflammation.31 Our effect esti-
mates were robust to adjustments for weight and BMI, possibly 
indicating that other pathways may be more important in this 
population. However, we were somewhat limited in our ability to 
look at associations in highly obese participants (>35 
kg/m2) due 
to sample size constraints. Given that regular physical activity 
protects against obesity33 and that a high BMI reduces measured 
lung volumes,34 we hesitate to completely exclude changes in 
weight/BMI as a potential pathway by which physical activity 
may affect lung function. It is more likely that this relationship is 
complex and dependent on the interaction of several factors, as 
demonstrated in Chinn et al,35 where the authors reported that 
the beneficial effects of smoking cessation on lung function were 
attenuated by subsequent weight gain.35
A final pathway may be that physical activity improves 
respiratory muscle endurance and strength,36 37 which could 
correspond to a short-term/moderate-term effect that requires 
sustained physical effort to maintain it. This hypothesis remains 
to be adequately tested as we were not able to do so given our 
available data. Nonetheless, the existence of a short-term/medi-
um-term mechanistic effect is consistent with our investigation 
of how changes in physical activity affected lung function, as 
only participants who were active at the last examination (either 
by becoming or remaining active) had significantly higher lung 
function than those consistently inactive.
We also observed that increased physical activity appeared 
to be associated with a lower mean FEV1/FVC ratio at both 
examinations. This result should be interpreted with substantial 
caution as it is likely to be driven by the apparent larger size 
of the association between physical activity on FVC compared 
with FEV1, which would lower the FEV1/FVC ratio among active 
individuals.
Finally, in our analysis, we found no associations between the 
physical activity indicators and the rate of lung function decline 
over the 10-year study period. T
wo studies that previously 
reported an association between physical activity and the amount 
or rate of FEV1 decline had a relatively short follow-up period 
(3.7 years7 and 5 years9), whereas others with longer follow-ups

found associations with lung function decline in subgroups only 
(current smokers,10 older Finnish men8 and asthmatics11). It is 
possible that differences in the physical activity assessment and 
the populations studied may have led to the inconsistencies in 
the results. For example, in the study that reported associations 
between physical activity and lung function decline after 10 
years 
in current smokers,10 the physical activity assessment included 
measures of light to vigorous physical activity during leisure time 
and work, whereas in the current analysis only data on leisure-
time vigorous physical activity were available. It is possible that 
moderate physical activity is more relevant for achieving long-
term reductions in lung function decline. Furthermore, no study 
has yet considered the impact of sedentary time on lung function 
decline, although sedentary behaviour can set off a low level but 
chronic proinflammatory response.38 Future studies with addi-
tional follow-ups (and shorter time gaps) and which include 
objective measures of various types and intensities of physical 
activity are needed to better understand these findings. Finally, 
random variability in the measurement of lung function (and 
consequently its changes over time) might have attenuated our 
ability to detect associations between physical activity and lung 
function decline.
strengths and limitations
Our results may be subject to selection bias as participants 
were more likely to have a high socioeconomic status (educa-
tion, occupation) and a higher FEV1 at the first examination 
than those who did not participate in the second examination. 
Although we were able to account for most known confounders, 
residual confounding may be a concern as we did not consider 
the effect of diet, as data on dietary total energy intake were 
only available for a subset of the study population and only at 
the second examination. We also did not consider the potential

for time-dependent confounding to affect our results, as this 
type of confounding was shown to not largely affect associations 
between physical activity and lung function in a similar study.11 
We evaluated the impact of information bias by excluding asth-
matics, those with current respiratory symptoms, those reporting 
avoiding vigorous exercise because of wheezing/asthma and the 
ECRHS symptomatic study arm in separate sensitivity analyses. 
However, as consistent associations were only found with lung 
function levels (and not lung function decline), our results are 
cross-sectional in nature and hence subject to potential reverse 
causation.
The use of questionnaires to collect physical activity infor-
mation is an important limitation of this study. It was not 
possible to collect more detailed information using personal 
measures in a study of this size, geographical distribution and 
with such a long follow-up. Any imprecision in the self-as-
sessment of physical activity by questionnaire, and also in the 
measurement of repeated lung function, would likely lead to 
non-differential misclassification, which would attenuate the 
results. Hence, physical activity exposure misclassification as 
well as random variability in the lung function measurements, 
and their calculated differences over time, may be potential 
reasons for why we do not see associations with lung function 
decline. Further, as aforementioned, we only had data to esti-
mate vigorous physical activity during leisure time,19 and it is 
possible that different physical activity intensities may yield 
different health effects.39 All analyses were adjusted for occu-
pation as an indicator of occupation-related physical activity, 
although this measure is certainly suboptimal. We were also 
unable to directly compare the physical activity categories 
used in this analysis with the current WHO recommendations 
for physical activity in adults.40 Nonetheless, it is noteworthy 
that associations were most robust for the ‘active status’ vari-
able, potentially suggesting that a combination of a certain 
minimum physical activity frequency and duration is required 
to achieve optimal health benefits.
Lung function measurements were made according to 
published recommendations and quality control procedures 
were followed. The spirometry devices were updated between 
examinations, which could have led to inherent temporal differ-
ences in lung function that may differ by age and height.41 Our 
results remained unchanged after replication with a set of lung 
function values corrected for change in spirometer, following a 
similar methodology as previously described for another adult 
cohort.41 Further strengths include the large sample size, popu-
lation-based nature of ECRHS and broad geographical represen-
tation of participants.
In conclusion, a beneficial link between increased leisure-
time vigorous physical activity and higher lung function was 
observed in this European prospective population-based study. 
Associations were only apparent among current smokers, 
which supports the existence of an inflammation-related 
biological mechanism and highlights the importance of phys-
ical activity in this group at higher risk (due to smoking) for 
poor lung function. No association between vigorous physical 
activity and lung function decline was observed, a result that 
requires further investigation.
