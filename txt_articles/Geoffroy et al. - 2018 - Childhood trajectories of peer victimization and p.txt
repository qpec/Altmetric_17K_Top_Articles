P
eer victimization is harm caused by peers acting outside 
the norms of appropriate conduct.1 It includes (but is not 
limited to) bullying, which is characterized by an imbal-
ance of power between the perpetrator and the victim. Peer vic-
timization has been prospectively associated with a broad range 
of internalizing and externalizing symptoms2–4 and mental health 
problems5–12 in childhood and adolescence, even after factors 
associated with victimization have been taken into account. It 
can be reduced through intervention,13,14 which thus represents a 
promising avenue to improve adolescents’ mental health at the 
population level. However, there is a gap in scientific knowledge, 
because no study has captured the development of victimization 
from the beginning of the school years to the transition to high 
school while documenting its impact on impairment associated

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Exposure to peer victim-
ization is relatively common. However, lit-
tle is known about its developmental 
course and its effect on impairment asso-
ciated with mental illnesses. We aimed to 
identify groups of children following dif-
ferential trajectories of peer victimization 
from ages 6 to 13 years and to examine 
predictive associations of these trajec-
tories with mental health in adolescence.
METHODS: Participants were members 
of the Quebec Longitudinal Study of 
Child Development, a prospective 
cohort of 2120 children born in 1997/98 
who were followed until age 15 years. 
We included 1363 participants with self-
reported victimization from ages 6 to 
13 years and data available on their 
mental health status at 15 years.
RESULTS: We identified 3 trajectories of 
peer victimization. The 2 prevailing groups 
were participants with little or moderate 
exposure to victimization (441/1685 
[26.2%] and 1000/1685 [59.3%], respec-
tively); the third group (244 [14.5%]) had 
been chronically exposed to the most 
severe and long-lasting levels of victimiza-
tion. The most severely victimized individ-
uals had greater odds of reporting debili-
tating depressive or dysthymic symptoms 
(odds ratio [OR] 2.56, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 1.27–5.17), debilitating gener-
alized anxiety problems (OR 3.27, CI 1.64–
6.51) and suicidality (OR 3.46, CI 1.53–7.81) 
at 15 years than those exposed to the low-
est levels of victimization, after adjustment 
for sex, childhood mental health, family 
hardship and victimization perpetration. 
The association with suicidality remained 
significant after controlling for concurrent 
symptoms of depression or dysthymia and 
generalized anxiety problems.
INTERPRETATION: Adolescents who were 
most severely victimized by peers had an 
increased risk of experiencing severe 
symptoms consistent with mental health 
problems. Given that peer victimization 
trajectories are established early on, 
interventions to reduce the risk of being 
victimized should start before enrolment 
in the formal school system.

with mental health problems. This is an important period in the 
life course, because social relationships are developing (i.e., lay-
ing the foundation for future relationships), peer victimization is 
at its highest rate,4 and mental health problems are emerging.15
In this study, we aimed to capture, at the population level, dif-
ferential exposure to peer victimization assessed from 6 to 
13 years of age, and predictive associations of such victimization 
with mental health problems at 15 years, while adjusting for a 
variety of potential confounders. It has been shown that a sub-
stantial proportion of those who have been victimized have also 
bullied others.7,16 Because perpetrators tend to display higher 
levels of aggression7 and conduct problems,17 we tested whether 
victimization increased the risk of symptoms of mental illness 
above and beyond the perpetration of victimization.
Methods
Participants
Participants were members of the Quebec Longitudinal Study of 
Child Development, a population-based sample of 2120 individ-
uals born in 1997/98 in the Canadian province of Quebec. For 
more details about the larger study design, please see www.
jesuisjeserai.stat.gouv.qc.ca/default_an.htm. 
Of the 1821 individuals invited at the 15-year data collection 
point, 1466 participated, including 1443 who completed mental 
health questions, and 1363 of this latter group also provided 
information on victimization trajectories (64.3% of the original 
2120; Appendix 1, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.170219/-/DC1). Participants who were under-
represented were more likely to be male (428/757 [56.5%] for 
those excluded from analyses v. 642/1363 [47.1%] for those 
included in analyses, χ2 = 22.54, p < 0.001), to be of nonwhite 
ethnicity (119/756 [15.7%] v. 68/1361 [5.0%], χ2 = 69.67, p < 
0.001), to have parents with low socioeconomic status (Z scores 
–0.16 v. 0.08, t2093 = –5.21, p < 0.001) and to have mothers with 
high depressive symptoms (1.50 v. 1.35 [on a scale from 0 to 
10], t1445.9 = 2,37 p = 0.02).  
Adolescent mental health outcomes at 15 years
At age 15 years, participants completed the Mental Health and 
Social Inadaptation Assessment,18 to assess the frequency, in the 
past 12 months (where 1 = never, 2 = sometimes, and 3 = often), 
of depression and dysthymia problems (Cronbach α = 0.90; 8 
items), generalized anxiety problems (Cronbach α = 0.86; 9 
items), social anxiety problems (Cronbach α = 0.90; 7 items), eat-
ing problems (Cronbach α = 0.70; 5 items), oppositional or defi-
ance problems (Cronbach α = 0.84; 9 items) and conduct prob-
lems (Cronbach α = 0.95; 16 items). We also asked participants to 
rate the severity (as “not at all,” “slightly,” “somewhat” or “a 
lot”) of any associated impairments across 4 domains of daily 
functioning (home, school, friendship or romantic relationships, 
daily occupations). Although the Mental Health and Social 
Inadap 
tation Assessment is not a diagnostic tool, its items have 
been designed to reflect the symptoms reported in the Diagnos-
tic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (Appen-
dix 2, part 1, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi: 
10.1503/cmaj.170219/-/DC1). Adolescents in the top 10% of 
symptoms were classified as having mental health problems. 
We measured suicidality in terms of having serious thoughts 
of wanting to die (as indicated by an affirmative answer to the 
question, “Did you ever seriously think of attempting suicide?”) 
or making a suicide attempt (and if so, how many attempts) in 
the past 12 months.
Childhood peer victimization between 6 and 13 years
We assessed peer victimization through self-rating at ages 6, 7, 
8, 10, 12 and 13 years using a modified version of the Self-Report 
Victimization Scale.19 This scale measures the occurrence of 
physical, verbal, relational and cyber-victimization since the 
beginning of the school year. All items were administered in the 
second half of the school year (from February to June) and are 
listed in Appendix 2, part 2. We coded the responses as 0 (never), 
1 (once/twice or rarely) or 2 (often, more often or very often). 
Within each year, we averaged individual item scores and 
re 
scaled them to range between 0 and 10, to obtain a global 
score of victimization. Cronbach α for each age ranged from 
0.70 to 0.80. 
Childhood confounders
We measured confounders at age 6, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 13 years, and 
averaged the scores across ages, unless otherwise indicated. 
Family hardship
We determined family hardship in terms of family socioeconomic 
status (aggregate of annual gross income, parental education 
level and occupational prestige),20 family structure when the 
child was 13 years of age (biological parents, blended family, sin-
gle parent), family functioning as assessed with the McMaster 
Family Assessment (7 items; e.g., “don’t get along well 
together”),21 hostile-reactive parenting practices (7 items; e.g., 
“use physical punishment”)22 and maternal depressive symp-
toms when the child was 8 and 10 years of age (e.g., Center for 
Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale23).
Childhood mental health and victimization perpetration
Oppositional and defiant behaviour (4 items; e.g., defiant or 
refused to comply), inattention and hyperactivity (9 items; e.g., 
“could not sit still”) and physical aggression symptoms 
(3 items, e.g., “got into a fight”) were all rated by school teach-
ers. Anxiety symptoms (4 items; e.g., “appears fearful/ner-
vous”) were reported by mothers when the children were 6 and 
8 years of age and were self-reported at ages 10, 12 and 
13 years. Victimizing others was self-reported at 10, 12 and 
13 years (10 items; e.g., “encouraged other children to pick on 
a particular child”). The questions were derived from the Can-
adian National Longitudinal Study of Children and Youth,21 
which incorporates items from the Child Behaviour Checklist,24 
the Ontario Child Health Study scales25 and the Preschool 
Behaviour Questionnaire,26 with responses rated on a 3-point 
scale. We assessed recent (past 2 wk) depressive symptoms at 
ages 10, 12 and 13 years using the Children’s Depression Inven-
tory, short version.27,28

Statistical analysis
To adjust for selective attrition that may have affected our study 
sample of 1363, we conducted analyses with and without inverse 
probability weights, representing participants’ probabilities of 
being included in the study sample conditional on sex, ethnicity, 
socioeconomic status and maternal depressive symptoms. The 
general pattern of results with and without weights did not differ; 
only the latter are presented here. 
We examined patterns of peer victimization by age and sex 
using analysis of variance. To take advantage of our repeated 
assessments of victimization, we estimated group-based trajec-
tories29 of peer victimization from 6 to 13 years of age. We 
applied growth mixture models to identify differential exposure 
to victimization using Mplus (Muthén & Muthén). 
We estimated a series of models including 1 to 4 trajectory 
groups based on the maximum available sample (n = 1685). 
Trajectories were estimated using a method called Full Infor-
mation Maximum Likelihood. With this method, each partici-
pant is used for information that the particular participant 
brings to the analy 
ses; the only participants who are excluded 
from the models are those who are always missing. The maxi-
mum available sample of 1685 was derived from the original 
sample of 2120. While those who provided data on both men-
tal health and victimization (n = 1363) were included in the 
maximum available sample, information on victimization was 
not available for the rest. We then selected the best-fitting 
model using the Bayesian Information Criterion, LoMendell-
Rubin likelihood ratio test and entropy. We controlled for all 
potential confounders that were available in our data and 
known for their associations with victimization. Appendix 3, 
part 1 (available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/
cmaj.170219/-/DC1), presents bivariable associations between 
confounders and peer victimization trajec 
tories. Then, we 
examined whether the victimization trajectories were predic-
tive of adolescents’ mental health using hierarchical logistic 
regressions. The associations were adjusted for sex (model 1), 
childhood family hardship (socioeconomic status, family func-
tioning and structure, hostile-reactive parenting, maternal 
depressive symptoms; model 2), childhood mental health 
(depression, anxiety, inattention/hyperactivity, oppositional/
defiant behaviour and physical aggression symptoms; model 
3) and victimization perpetration (model 4). 
All interactions with sex were nonsignificant (p values for sex 
interaction: p = 0.5 for depression/dysthymia problem, p = 0.7 
for generalized anxiety problem, p = 0.7 for social anxiety prob-
lem, p = 0.4 for suicidality, p > 0.9 for eating problem, p = 0.2 for 
oppositional/defiant problem, p = 0.6 for conduct problem); 
therefore, we present results for both sexes combined. Data 
were missing for less than 6% of participants for all covariables, 
except for maternal depressive symptoms (where data were 
missing for 12%). To minimize further data loss, we imputed 
missing information on confounders using multiple imputa-
tions by the chained equations method,30 and we conducted 
analyses across the 10 imputed data sets. Patterns of results 
were identical for both maximum available participants and the 
imputed samples.
Ethics approval
The Ethics Committee of the Institut de la statistique du Québec 
and the Research Ethics Board of the CHU Sainte-Justine 
Research Center approved each phase of the study, and 
informed consent was obtained. 
Results
The sociodemographic characteristics of the 1363 participants 
included in the analysis are presented in Table 1. 
As shown in Table 2, peer victimization declined for males 
and females as they grew older. Males reported more victimiza-
tion than females: marginally more at age 6 but significantly 
more at all later ages. 
Figure 1 depicts trajectories of victimization according to the 
3-group model (based on the maximum available sample of 1685),

Although the Bayesian Information Criterion decreased slightly 
across the 1- to 4-group models, a closer examination of the 4- and 
3-group models indicated that the LoMendell-Rubin likelihood 
ratio test and entropy favoured a 3-group model. We therefore 
selected a 3-group model reflecting distinct trajectories of victim-
ization. Most of the children (1000/1685 [59.3%]) followed a trajec-
tory of moderate victimization, whereas 441 (26.2%) followed a 
stable trajectory of no or low victimization, and 244 (14.5%) fol-
lowed a trajectory of severe victimization. There was a decrease in 
victimization with age for both the moderate victimization (p = 
0.009) and severe victimization (p < 0.001) groups. Table 3 shows 
the prevalence of the 7 mental health outcomes in the 3 trajectory 
groups. The proportion of adolescents who reported mental 
health problems at 15 years of age increased with the severity of 
peer victimization (all p values < 0.05).
Predictive associations of victimization trajectories 
with mental health in adolescence
Compared with the trajectory for none/low victimization, severe 
victimization was associated with higher odds of reporting a 
depression/dysthymia problem (odds ratio [OR] 2.34, 95% confi-
dence interval [CI] 1.20–4.53), generalized anxiety problem (OR 
3.32, 95% CI 1.75–6.30) or suicidality (OR 3.46, 95% CI 1.53–7.81) 
at 15 years, with adjustment for sex, childhood family hardship, 
mental health and victimization perpetration (Table 4). Addition-
ally, relative to those with the trajectory for moderate victimiza-
tion, children with severe victimization had higher odds of 
reporting a depression/dysthymia problem (OR 1.78, 95% CI 
1.06–2.97), generalized anxiety problem (OR 2.19, 95% CI 1.34–
3.58), social anxiety problem (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.07–2.88) and sui-
cidality (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.17–3.75) (Appendix 3, part 2). Children 
with moderate victimization in childhood did not have an 
increased risk of reporting mental health problems after we 
accounted for all confounders, except for a marginally significant 
association with conduct problem (Appendix 3, part 3).  
We further examined the significance of longitudinal associa-
tions through sensitivity analyses of depression/dysthymia and 
generalized anxiety problems by considering the impairment cri-
teria (i.e., adolescents reporting symptoms that interfered with 
their functioning, who answered “somewhat” or “a lot” to at 
least 1 of the 4 impairment questions). As shown in Table 5, ado-
lescents who reported severe victimization had an increased risk 
of a debilitating depression/dysthymia problem (OR 2.56, 95% CI 
1.27–5.17) or a debilitating generalized anxiety problem (OR 3.27, 
95% CI 1.64–6.51) in the fully adjusted model. 
Finally, we tested the possibility that severe victimization pre-
dicted suicidality (i.e., serious ideation or attempt), independent 
of comorbid mental health problems associated with victimiza-
tion. After adjustment for reported depression/dysthymia and 
generalized anxiety problems at 15 years, sex, childhood family 
hardship, mental health and victimization perpetration, adoles-

cents who reported severe victimization had an increased risk of 
suicidal ideation or attempted suicide (OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.16–6.54).
We repeated all analyses with adjustment for confounders that 
were assessed at baseline only (i.e., at 6 yr); the pattern of results 
was identical with what has been reported here (data not shown).
Interpretation
Our study captured differential trajectories of victimization over 
a 7-year period while documenting the consequences on a wide 
range of mental health problems commonly seen in today’s ado-
lescents and associated impairments. Adolescents who were 
severely victimized showed an increased risk of severe symp-
toms of certain mental health problems. Compared with other 
studies that have relied on victimization and exposure to bully-
ing assessed at a single point in time,8,31–33 our trajectory analyses 
have the advantage of identifying patterns of victimization vary-
ing in severity and over time, highlighting a general decline in 
victimization with age. 
Importantly, our findings showed a general tendency, in 
about 15% of the children, of being exposed to the most severe 
levels of victimization from the beginning of their education until 
the transition to high school. Those children were at greater risk 
of debilitating depressive/dysthymic symptoms or anxiety and of 
suicidality in adolescence than less severely victimized children, 
even after we accounted for a plethora of confounders assessed 
throughout childhood. Thus, our results, along with those of 
many other studies,4,5,8,16,34 suggest that severe peer victimization 
may contribute to the development of mental health problems in 
adolescence. Therefore, it is important to prevent severe victim-
ization early in the lifespan. 
Our findings also add to existing knowledge by showing that 
the predictive association of severe victimization with suicidal-
ity is independent of concurrent depression/dysthymia and 
generalized anxiety problems. This is consistent with a large 
body of data suggesting that suicide risk is strongly associated 
with, but independent of, psychopathology.35 It remains to be 
determined whether the effect of victimization on suicide risk is 
mediated by factors that have been previously found to explain 
part of suicide risk, such as impulsive and aggressive traits.36–38 
Previous studies that included a victimized-perpetrator group 
reported that individuals who are both victims and perpetra-
tors, but not those who are only victims, were at risk of exter-
nalizing problems.7,16 In this regard, severe victimization no lon-

ger predicted externalizing problems (e.g., oppositional/defiant 
behaviour and conduct), after adjustment for victimization per-
petration in our models.
Finally, we found that 59.3% of the sample had been exposed to 
moderate levels of victimization during the first years of elementary 
school, but not so much thereafter. The large proportion of individ-
uals belonging to this group could reflect the fact that our assess-
ments covered young ages (i.e., 6–8 yr), when victimization behav-
iour is frequent. Moderate victimization was not predictive of 
mental health problems after we accounted for childhood mental 
health symptoms assessed concurrently with victimization.
Limitations
Our study had the following limitations. Mental health outcomes 
were measured by self-report questionnaires, which do not provide 
clinical diagnoses. We used an interference scale reflecting prob-
lems affecting daily activities to increase the chances of identifying 
clinically significant problems. Despite their limitations, self-report 
questionnaires and arbitrary cut-offs (e.g., top 10% of scores) are 
commonly used to identify mental health problems in epidemio-
logic surveys.9,39 Furthermore, peer victimization was also self-
reported, and may reflect a perception potentially biased by the 
participant’s mental state. However, such bias was minimized, 
because we carefully adjusted for mental health symptoms mea-
sured concurrently with victimization. Although we controlled for a 
wide range of confounders, we acknowledge that uncontrolled 
variables could account for some of the associations. Our design 
does not prove causality; however, we were able to examine the 
temporal relation from childhood victimization to mental health in 
adolescence, because our prospective study design allowed adjust-
ment for childhood mental health symptoms and other influences. 
Given the smaller number of males reporting mental health prob-
lems and suicidality, statistical power was low for investigating 
moderation by sex in the observed associations. As in all longitudi-
nal surveys, attrition occurred, and some population subgroups 
were underrepresented. This differential attrition could potentially 
result in underestimation of associations with victimization for the 
most vulnerable individuals. However, the patterns of results were 
consistent across weighted, imputed and maximum available sam-
ples, so the bias related to selective drop-out is likely to be small.
Conclusion
More than half of the children in our study experienced moderate 
exposure to victimization, especially during early childhood. This 
finding suggests that being called names or being excluded from 
social groups once in a while is somewhat normal. This form of vic-
timization was not associated with greater propensity to report 
mental health problems. A smaller group of children were victim-
ized often and repeatedly over the years. Such severe victimization 
affected about 15% of school-aged children and was associated 
with an increased risk of experiencing severe symptoms consistent 
with mental health problems. Although peer victimization starts to 
decrease by the end of childhood, individuals in the severe trajec-
tory group were still being exposed to the highest level of victimiza-
tion in early adolescence. Therefore, antibullying interventions 
should begin before enrolment in the formal school system. Experi-
mental studies aimed at preventing victimization would provide 
information about both the efficacy of preventive measures and 
the potentially causal role of victimization.
