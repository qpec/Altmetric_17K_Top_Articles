SUMMARY
The development of stabilized recombinant HIV en-
velope trimers that mimic the virion surface molecule
has increased enthusiasm for a neutralizing antibody
(nAb)-based HIV vaccine. However, there is limited
experience with recombinant trimers as immunogens
in nonhuman primates, which are typically used as a
model for humans. Here, we tested multiple immuno-
gens and immunization strategies head-to-head to
determine their impact on the quantity, quality, and
kinetics of autologous tier 2 nAb development. A
bilateral, adjuvanted, subcutaneous immunization
protocol induced reproducible tier 2 nAb responses
after only two immunizations 8 weeks apart, and
these were further enhanced by a third immunization
with BG505 SOSIP trimer. We identified immunogens
that minimized non-neutralizing V3 responses and
demonstrated that continuous immunogen delivery
could enhance nAb responses. nAb responses were
strongly associated with germinal center reactions,
as assessed by lymph node fine needle aspiration.
This study provides a framework for preclinical and
clinical vaccine studies targeting nAb elicitation.
INTRODUCTION
Successful vaccines to viral pathogens rely heavily on the induc-
tion of neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses for host protection
(Plotkin, 2010). However, the induction of nAbs to circulating HIV
(so-called tier 2 viruses) through immunization has proven very

 difficult. The surface HIV envelope (Env) spike, which consists of
a heterotrimer of composition (gp120)3(gp41)3, is the sole target
of HIV nAbs. All human HIV vaccine trials to date have failed to
induce tier 2 nAbs (Haynes et al., 2012; Mascola and Montefiori,
2010). These trials mostly utilized monomeric Env gp120 or poor
gp140 mimics of native Env spikes, which resulted in the gener-
ation of non-neutralizing or tier 1 nAbs only. The latter neutralize
only lab-adapted and very easy-to-neutralize HIV strains, which
are not representative of most viruses circulating in humans
(Mascola et al., 2005). The failure to induce tier 2 nAb responses
has been associated with differences between the presentation
of critical epitopes on the immunogens used and their presenta-
tion on the native Env spike. The generation of molecules that
more faithfully mimic the spike, particularly the SOSIP trimer
(Binley et al., 2000; Sanders et al., 2002; Sanders and Moore,
2017; Sanders et al., 2013), has opened up new opportunities
for the induction of tier 2 nAbs. Indeed, native-like Env trimers
have successfully induced tier 2 nAbs in small animal models
(de Taeye et al., 2016; Feng et al., 2016; McCoy et al., 2016;
Sanders et al., 2015) and less reproducibly in nonhuman pri-
mates
(NHPs)
(Havenar-Daughton
et
al.,
2016;
Sanders
et al., 2015).
NHPs, and specifically rhesus macaques (RMs), are often
argued to be the most appropriate pre-clinical model for HIV
vaccine studies because of the close genetic relatedness of
NHPs to humans. Three RM studies using trimeric Env immuno-
gens reported the induction of autologous tier 2 nAbs (Havenar-
Daughton et al., 2016; Hessell et al., 2016; Sanders et al., 2015),
and two of these studies used SOSIP trimer designs (Havenar-
Daughton et al., 2016; Sanders et al., 2015). However, there
have been concerns about the limitations of such results. Tier
2 nAb titers were primarily reported after 6–12 months of immu-
nizations, and titers were relatively low. Most worrisome was
the observation that only a fraction of the monkeys developed
nAbs, raising concerns about whether Env trimers will elicit tier
2 nAbs in humans (Havenar-Daughton et al., 2017; Sanders
and Moore, 2017).
To optimize the induction of autologous tier 2 nAb responses
by native-like trimer immunizations, we investigated a number
of parameters, including immunization route, dose, and timing
of immunizations. We studied two trimer platforms, the SOSIP
and native-flexible linker (NFL) platforms (Sharma et al., 2015).
We investigated the effects of additional stabilizing mutations
applied to the SOSIP platform and the effects of continuous
and bolus immunization.
In all cases, we focused on the analysis of tier 2 nAb and non-
neutralizing Ab responses, together with germinal center (GC) re-
sponses, in the draining lymph nodes (LNs). NAb development
requires affinity maturation, which takes place in GCs under
the control of GC T follicular helper (Tfh) cells (Crotty, 2014; Vic-
tora and Nussenzweig, 2012). GC activity after booster immuni-
zations has been associated with nAb development in BG505
SOSIP immunized RMs (Havenar-Daughton et al., 2016). Thus,
modulating GC B and Tfh cell quantities and qualities could
help guide optimization of HIV nAb induction by immunization.
In summary, we tested multiple stabilized, trimeric Env immu-
nogens and immunization strategies head-to-head to evaluate
their impact on the quantity, quality, and kinetics of tier 2 nAb
development. We found that unlike intramuscular (i.m.) injec-
tions, subcutaneous (s.c.) immunizations reliably induced nAb
titers in NHPs and that longer intervals between prime and
booster immunizations increased GC B cell frequencies. GC B
frequencies predicted and correlated with nAb development
in NHPs, and their expansion should thus be targeted by vacci-
nation strategies. We showed that stabilizing mutations in the
SOSIP immunogen can lead to lower HIV V3-loop responses
and that continuous immunization can induce notably stronger
nAb responses than bolus immunization. This study provides a
framework for preclinical and clinical vaccine studies targeting
the development of HIV nAbs.
RESULTS
Induction of Potent nAb Titers after Two Immunizations
with Env Trimers
To try to improve the consistency and magnitude of BG505
SOSIP.664 nAb responses, we evaluated a modified immuniza-
tion protocol designed to boost and prolong GC activity between
immunizations. In a previous study using BG505 SOSIP.v5.2 in
RMs, elevated frequencies of GC B cells were most likely present
for at least 6 weeks after the first immunization. However, admin-
istration of the second immunization at the 6 week time point
resulted in weaker GC responses than the first immunization (Ha-
venar-Daughton et al., 2016). Therefore, we extended the initial
immunization interval from 6 to 8 weeks. A third immunization
was scheduled at week 24, consistent with conventional
human vaccine schedules (Figure 1A). Twelve RMs were each
immunized with BG505 SOSIP.664 (100 mg) formulated with
ISCOMATRIX adjuvant, and each dose was split between two im-
munization sites. ISCOMATRIX is a strong immunostimulatory

 complex (Sun et al., 2009) that does not disturb the trimer struc-
ture (Sanders et al., 2015) and has previously been used to stimu-
late tier 2 nAbresponses (Havenar-Daughtonet al., 2016;Sanders
et al., 2015). Bilateral injections were used to potentially increase
recruitment of rare antigen-specific B cells and CD4+ T cells.
All animals developed high BG505 SOSIP binding IgG titers
(>1:1,000) after the second immunization (Figure 1B). After the
third immunization at week 24, BG505 SOSIP binding IgG titers
peaked with titers ranging from 1:2,000 to 1:20,000 (Figure 1B).
To assess the development of autologous nAb titers, we
tested sera for neutralization of BG505 pseudovirus by using
TZM-bl cell neutralization assays (Figure 1C). At week 10, after
only two immunizations, 11/12 animals developed nAb re-
sponses (1:140 geometric mean titer [GMT]). One animal, 12-
084, developed an exceptionally strong nAb titer of 1:20,000.
Tier 1 nAb titers (SF162 and MW965 pseudoviruses) were also
tested and found to be uniformly high, in the range of 1:1,000–
1:10,000 (Figure S1A). Sera from all animals were also tested
for neutralization in the Montefiori laboratory at Duke University,
and nAb titers correlated (p < 0.0001, r = 0.87; Figure S1B).
BG505 nAb titers were boosted after the third immunization
(1:209 GMT; Figure 1C). Importantly, 100% of RMs responded
with a robust titer of approximately 1:100 or higher. No correla-
tion was found between BG505 nAb titers and BG505 SOSIP
or V3-peptide ELISA binding immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers (Fig-
ures S1C and S1D). There was, however, a correlation between
tier 1 nAb titers and V3-peptide ELISA binding titers, as previ-
ously observed (Havenar-Daughton et al., 2016; Sanders et al.,
2015). Thus, this modified BG505 SOSIP immunization protocol
substantially improved response rates, response kinetics, and
peak autologous HIV neutralization titers in RMs over those
from earlier studies. These HIV tier 2 nAb responses are the
strongest, earliest, and most consistent HIV tier 2 nAb responses
reported to date after protein, DNA, or vector immunization of
monkeys.
Early GC Activity Predicts nAb Development
To
investigate
the
underlying
immunological
mechanisms
contributing to consistent and rapid nAb titer development, we
performed LN fine needle aspirates (FNAs) after each immuniza-
tion. GC B cell frequencies in the draining LNs were significantly
increased after the first immunization (Figures 1D, 1E, and S1E),
as were GC Tfh cell frequencies (Figures 1F, 1G, and S1E). GC B
and Tfh cell frequencies were significantly higher than baseline
values after each of the three immunizations (Figures S1F and
S1G) and were correlated (r = 0.71, p < 0.0001; Figure S1H). In
contrast to the previously examined 6 week booster interval,
GC B cell frequencies after the second immunization at week 8
were significantly higher than after the first immunization (Fig-
ure 1H). In the previous study, GC responses partially correlated
with nAb development (Havenar-Daughton et al., 2016), which
led us to hypothesize that early GC responses to the first immu-
nization in this study might predict the development of BG505
nAbs. Indeed, GC B cell frequencies 3 weeks after the first immu-
nization predicted rapid autologous BG505 nAb titers at week 10
(r = 0.64, p = 0.026; Figure 1I). In addition, post-second-immuni-
zation GC B cells correlated with post-second-immunization
nAb titers (r = 0.61, p = 0.035; Figure 1J), and post-third-immu-
nization GC B cells correlated with post-third-immunization
nAb titers (r = 0.68, p = 0.014; Figure 1K). In contrast, GC B
cell frequency did not correlate with BG505 SOSIP ELISA bind-
ing IgG titers at any time point (Figure S1I) or tier 1 nAb titers
(Figure S1J). In sum, GC B cell frequencies in the draining LNs
predicted and correlated with the magnitude of nAb develop-
ment throughout the immunization regimen, highlighting the
importance of generating strong GC responses.
Subcutaneous Immunizations Induce Stronger nAb
Responses Than Intramuscular Immunizations
To evaluate the contribution of the route of immunization to
the development of consistent and rapid HIV nAb titers, we
compared RMs immunized by either s.c. or i.m. injection with
equal doses of BG505 SOSIP.664 (100 mg) on the same schedule
(Figure 1A). Peak nAb titers were significantly lower after i.m. im-
munization than after s.c. immunization (p = 0.02; Figures 2A and
S2A). Only 7 of 12 animals immunized via i.m. injection developed
a detectable nAb response, similar to the first BG505 SOSIP.664
RM immunization study, which used the i.m. route (Sanders et al.,
2015). Lower GC B cell frequencies (p % 0.007; Figure 2B) and
GC Tfh cell frequencies (Figure 2C) were observed after i.m. im-
munizations than after s.c. immunizations.
We hypothesized that the difference between s.c. and i.m. GC
and nAb responses could have arisen from lower availability of
intact trimers for B cell recognition in the draining LNs after
i.m. immunizations than after s.c. immunization. SOSIP binding
titers were not significantly different between the i.m. and s.c.
groups (Figure 2D), whereas both gp120 (Figure 2E) and V3-
peptide Ab binding titers were lower in the i.m. group (Fig-
ure S2B), arguing against trimer decay as the underlying cause.
We therefore examined LN drainage after i.m. or s.c. immuniza-
tion in a separate experiment by using the trackable dye Evans
Blue. The s.c. immunizations resulted in more rapid drainage
to the inguinal LNs (48 hr; Figure 2F) and increased dye accu-
mulation over time (72 hr; Figure 2F). The lymphatic drainage
data suggest that more trimer immunogen reaches LN B cells
after s.c. immunization, potentially increasing recruitment of
antigen-specific B and CD4+ T cells and subsequent affinity
maturation to improve nAb generation. In sum, s.c. immuniza-
tion resulted in stronger autologous nAb responses than i.m.
immunization.

 NFL Trimers Induce Approximately Equivalent but
Slower nAb Responses Than SOSIP Trimers
NFL trimers have similar structural and antigenic properties to
SOSIP trimers (Guenaga et al., 2015; Sharma et al., 2015), but
an in vivo comparison of both platforms in RMs is lacking. We
immunized six RMs with 100 mg of BG505 NFL trimers in parallel
with RMs immunized with BG505 SOSIP.664 (Figure 1A). NFL-
and SOSIP-immunized RMs developed similar peak nAb titers,
although there was a trend toward somewhat lower titers for
NFL (SOSIP = 1:209 GMT versus NFL = 1:65 GMT, p = 0.1; Fig-
ure 2G). NFL-induced nAb titers were statistically lower after the
second immunization (Figure 2H). ELISA binding IgG titers were
lower for BG505-NFL-immunized animals than for SOSIP-immu-
nized animals when BG505 SOSIP was used as the ELISA anti-
gen (Figure 2I), but they were similar when BG505 NFL was used
as the antigen (Figure 2J). The differential ELISA data could indi-
cate subtle differences between the SOSIP and NFL trimer ba-
ses or that overall structure and glycosylation influence immuno-
genicity. Of note, in contrast to BG505 SOSIP, the BG505 NFL
design included a His-tag, which elicited an anti-His antibody
(Ab) response (Figure S2C). BG505 gp120 binding titers, V3-
peptide binding titers, and tier 1 nAb titers were also significantly
lower in NFL-immunized animals (Figures 2K, S2D, and S2E).
Ratios of tier 2 to tier 1 nAb titers were similar in NFL- and
SOSIP-immunized animals (Figure 2L). GC B cell and GC Tfh
cell frequencies were comparable across all measured time
points (Figures S2F and S2G). Overall, BG505 NFL and SOSIP
trimer constructs induced similar nAb and GC responses.
Trimer Stabilization Strategies Can Reduce V3-Loop
Antigenicity
Although BG505 SOSIP.664 trimers have generally excellent
antigenic properties (Sanders et al., 2013), there is evidence
for some flexibility of the molecule and exposure of regions,
such as the V3 loop tip, that are not exposed on virion surface tri-
mers (de Taeye et al., 2015). Indeed, SOSIP immunization has
consistently produced relatively strong non-neutralizing anti-V3
responses that are not useful in a vaccine context and could
be distracting (Mascola and Montefiori, 2010; Sanders et al.,
2015). Therefore, we investigated the immunogenicity of four
constructs designed to further stabilize the SOSIP molecule
in general and to reduce the exposure of the V3 loop in partic-
ular (de Taeye et al., 2015; Guenaga et al., 2015; Steichen
et al., 2016).
Groups of six RMs were immunized with 100 mg of BG505
SOSIP.v4.1
(de
Taeye
et
al.,
2015),
BG505
SOSIP.v5.2
(A.T.d.l.P. et al., unpublished data; Havenar-Daughton et al.,
2016), BG505 Olio6, or BG505 Olio6 CD4-KO (D.W.K. et al.,
unpublished data) in parallel with RMs immunized with BG505
SOSIP.664 after the same immunization scheme as in Figure 1A.
Because a major focus of these four modified Env trimer designs
was V3-loop stabilization and sequestration (Figure 3A), V3-pep-
tide and gp120 binding IgG titers were compared. Three of the
modified SOSIP constructs, but not SOSIP v4.1, elicited signifi-
cantly lower V3-peptide ELISA binding titers than the wild-type
(WT) SOSIP.664 molecule (Figure 3B). This pattern was repeated
for gp120 binding IgG titers (Figure S3A), consistent with the
notion that V3 reactivity is a major contributor to gp120 binding.
Only the Olio6 constructs showed somewhat reduced SOSIP
ELISA binding titers (Figure 3C), consistent with the finding that
these constructs had the highest reduction in V3 Ab titers, which
were detected in SOSIP ELISAs (Figure S3B). To exclude the
possibility that the mutated V3-loop in Olio6 trimers elicits anti-
bodies that do not cross-react with BG505 WT V3-loop residues,
we compared V3 binding Ab titers with both WT and Olio6 V3-
loop peptides for all groups and found no differences (Figure 3D).
We separately confirmed WT and Olio6 V3-peptide antigenicity
by comparing a panel of six well-characterized V3-loop Abs in
peptide-binding ELISAs and found only one epitope to be slightly
altered (Figure S3C), consistent with the extensive cross-reac-
tivity of anti-V3-loop responses across HIV strains. As expected,
ratios of SOSIP to V3-peptide binding Ab were increased for the
three constructs that showed less V3-peptide binding than
SOSIP.664 (Figure S3D). Further, ratios of BG505 nAb to V3-
peptide binding Ab were increased for both Olio6 immunogens
(Figure S3E), again consistent with the strong redirection of the
Ab response away from the non-neutralizing V3-loop epitope.
We then examined induction of tier 1 nAb titers, which are
driven most prominently by V3-loop-tip-directed Abs (Figures
S3F and S3G). Compared with titers from when WT SOSIP.664
was used as the immunogen, tier 1 SF162 titers were similar in
SOSIP.v4.1-immunized animals, reduced in SOSIP.v5.2-immu-
nized animals, and almost completely abrogated in animals
immunized with Olio6 and Olio6 CD4-KO (Figure 3E). In sum,
V3-loop stabilization of the BG505 immunogen was successful
at reducing the immunogenicity of the V3 epitope in immunized
RMs for three of the four designs tested, and the Olio6 designs
proved most effective.

 Despite the reductions in V3 responses, we observed no dif-
ferences in absolute tier 2 nAb responses between the modified
constructs and WT SOSIP.664 (Figure 3F). Surprisingly, nAb ti-
ters were somewhat but significantly reduced for SOSIP.v5.2.
However, both Olio6 and Olio6 CD4-KO induced 10- to 20-fold
greater ratios of tier 2 to tier 1 nAb titers than SOSIP.664 (Fig-
ure 3G). The lack of enhanced nAb responses could arise
because reduction or elimination of a single immunodominant
non-neutralizing epitope site does not sufficiently shift the immu-
nodominance hierarchy (Havenar-Daughton et al., 2017).
GC B cell and GC Tfh cell responses were compared between
RMs immunized with different Env trimer designs. Olio6 CD4-KO
generated significantly lower frequencies of GC B cells than did
SOSIP.664 after the first and second immunizations (Figures 3H
and 3I). GC Tfh cell frequencies were also significantly reduced in
Olio6 CD4-KO groups after both the first and second immuniza-
tions (Figures 3J and 3K). The other stabilized immunogens
followed a similar trend. The reduced GC B cell and Tfh cell fre-
quencies could be explained by diminished V3-loop- and gp120-
specific (rather than trimer-specific) B cells in the GCs. GC B cell
frequencies correlated with BG505 nAb titers (Figures 3L and
S3H). Unlike GC B cells in BG505-SOSIP.664-immunized ani-
mals, GC B cells also correlated with BG505 SOSIP binding titers
(r = 0.61, p = 0.004; Figure 3M) after immunization with stabilized
BG505 immunogens. One potentially confounding variable was
that Abs were generated to the His-tag present in the Olio6
designs (Figure S3I). Nevertheless, additional positive correla-
tions were found between GC Tfh cell frequencies and BG505
nAb titers (Figures S3J and S3K). The multiple correlations be-
tween GC cell populations and Ab responses suggest an overall
more focused immune response toward nAbs after immunization
with a stabilized trimer.
20 and 100 mg Env Trimer Doses Induce Comparable
nAb Responses
To investigate the effects of immunogen dosage on nAb titer
responses, we immunized six RMs with 20 mg of BG505
SOSIP.664 according to the same schedule used for the group
receiving 100 mg BG505 SOSIP.664 (Figure 1A). Average GMT
nAb titers 2 weeks after the third immunization were not statisti-
cally different between the 20 and 100 mg groups (Figure 4A).
Additional Ab measurements at the same time point also showed
no differences (Figures 4B and S4A). There was a suggestion
that the kinetics of the nAb responses in the 20 mg group were
distinct (Figure 4C). Thus, serum nAb titers appeared to develop
somewhat more slowly in the 20 mg group, although this did not
achieve statistical significance (week 10 GMT = 1:33 for 20 mg
group versus 1:113 for 100 mg group, p = 0.08; Figure 4C), and
nAb titers peaked at 4 instead of 2 weeks past the third immuni-
zation (peak nAb GMT for 20 mg group = 1:139 at week 28 versus
1:92 GMT at week 26; Figure 4C). GC B cell and Tfh cell fre-
quencies were not significantly different between the 20 and
100 mg groups (Figures 4D and 4E), although there was an indi-
cation of somewhat lower frequencies after the first immuniza-
tion. In conclusion, lowering the Env trimer dose from 100 to
20 mg could have altered the kinetics of the serum Ab response
somewhat, but it had little effect on the development of peak tier
2 nAb.
An Extended Immunogen-Release Strategy Induces
Higher nAb Titers Than Conventional Immunization
Conventional immunizations are typically single-bolus events
that deliver a volume of immunogen and adjuvant via a sy-
ringe needle. Extended immunogen release is an alternative
immunization approach that could be advantageous for several
reasons. First, GCs are relatively long-lasting and antigen-
dependent engines of affinity maturation. As such, extended
immunogen and adjuvant release could improve development
of nAbs by making more trimer immunogen available during
the GC response. Second, immunogens are subject to prote-
olysis or other protein-degradation pathways over time. Non-
mechanical osmotic pumps can provide extended immu-
nogen-release kinetics over weeks while protecting the native
trimer structure until the time of release (Hu et al., 2015). Third,
extended antigen availability, preferably with increased dose
kinetics, mimics conditions found in natural infection and is
therefore the scenario for which GCs are naturally optimized.
Encouraging data in support of these ideas were obtained in
mice (Hu et al., 2015; Tam et al., 2016).
To determine whether sustained immunogen delivery could
enhance the nAb response in RMs, we loaded 14 day linear-
release osmotic pumps with 50 mg BG505 SOSIP.v5.2 and adju-
vant and implanted them subcutaneously in the left and right legs
at weeks 0, 8, and 24. At the end of each immunogen delivery,
RMs were each given bolus immunizations totaling 100 mg
SOSIP.v5.2 to mimic dose-escalation kinetics (Figure 4F).
Thus, the total dose of BG505 SOSIP.v5.2 given was 200 mg in
each immunization period, whereas 100 mg was used in the
control group. After a single dosing regimen, three of six
pump-immunized animals had detectable nAb titers (week 8;
Figure 4G). Pump delivery resulted in significantly higher nAb ti-
ters than conventional immunization, as well as shifted kinetics,
after both the second and third immunizations (Figure 4G). Peak
nAb titers were significantly higher in pump-immunized animals
(1:1,023 GMT versus 1:86 GMT; Figure 4H). Three of six pump-
immunized RMs developed nAb titers of >1:1,000. BG505 and
V3-loop Ab binding titers were similarly shifted (Figures S4B–
S4D). Neutralizing Ab titers of pump-immunized animals re-
mained significantly higher than those of conventionally immu-
nized RMs 4 months after the third immunization (Figure 4G).
In terms of LN GC reactions, B cell frequencies were similar in
both pump and conventional immunization groups 3 weeks after
immunization (Figure 4I), but Tfh cell frequencies were greater in
pump-immunized animals after the second and third immuniza-
tions (Figure 4J). Interestingly, pump-immunized animals had
significantly higher frequencies of proliferating Ki67+ GC Tfh cells
immunizations. (K) Proliferation of GC Tfh cells at week 11. Flow cytometry was gated on CXCR5hi PD-1hi GC Tfh cells. (L) Frequency of Ki67+ GC Tfh cells at week

 than conventionally immunized RMs (Figure 4L). GC Tfh cells are
generally minimally proliferative once a GC is established (Crotty,
2014), and therefore, the observation of robust GC Tfh cell pro-
liferation in pump-immunized RMs is consistent with the finding
that extended immunogen release changes GC characteristics
and kinetics. In conclusion, slow-release immunization acceler-
ated nAb development and enhanced peak nAb titers, and these
improvements were associated with GC Tfh cell changes.
Liposomal Presentation of Env Trimer Immunogen
Generates nAbs
Liposomal presentation of native-like Env trimers as immuno-
gens has potential advantages over soluble protein immuniza-
tion. Naive B cells that recognize nAb epitopes on the HIV Env
trimer are likely to be of very low affinity, and arrayed trimers
on a liposomal surface can provide increased avidity for activa-
tion (Ingale et al., 2016; Steichen et al., 2016). In addition, non-
neutralizing epitopes at the base of the trimer can be highly
immunogenic and can inhibit development of responses to
nAb epitopes (Havenar-Daughton et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2015).
Liposomal presentation of immunogen could block access to
these non-neutralizing epitopes.
To investigate the effects of liposomal presentation of immu-
nogen, we immunized six RMs with 100 mg each of BG505
Olio6 CD4-KO (day 0) and BG505 MD39 CD4-KO (week 8) cova-
lently conjugated to liposomes. A covalent linkage of the trimer to
the liposome was necessary because a non-covalent His-tag/
nickel-conjugation approach was not stable for in vitro incuba-
tion in RM serum (Figures S5A and S5B). Six RMs were immu-
nized with His-tag/nickel-conjugated BG505 SOSIP.664 (Fig-
ure S5C), but given the rapid dissociation of His-tag/nickel-
conjugated liposomal particles, they were not analyzed further.
In the covalently conjugated BG505 Olio6 CD4-KO liposome
group, five of six animals had nAb titers at week 12 (Figure 5A).
BG505 nAb titers were similar but slightly lower in the liposomal
group than in the soluble immunogen group (Figures 5A and
S5D). Tier 1 nAb titers were not different (Figures S5E and
S5F). BG505 SOSIP binding titers were elevated in liposome-
immunized RMs (Figure 5B), whereas V3-peptide IgG titers
were similar (Figure 5C). GC B cell (Figure 5D) and GC Tfh cell
(Figure 5E) frequencies were similar after both the first and sec-
ond immunizations. Liposome immunization induced 4-fold
more BG505-specific IgG+ blood plasmablasts (Figure S5G).
Overall, the BG505 trimers covalently linked to liposomes, as
used here, induced immune responses comparable to those of
soluble immunogen after two immunizations.
GC Characteristics after Each Immunization
Longitudinal GC responses were measured with LN FNAs for
all study animals. GC B cell frequencies were significantly
increased after a single Env trimer immunization when all
groups were considered (p < 0.0001; Figure 6A and Table S2).
The second immunization generated larger GC B cell responses
than the first immunization (p < 0.0001; Figure 6A), supporting
the rationale for shifting the timing of the second immunization
to allow for a period of quiescence. GC Tfh cell frequencies
were significantly increased after the first and second immuniza-
tions (p < 0.002; Figure 6B). GC Tfh cell and GC B cell fre-
quencies were correlated (r = 0.67, p < 0.0001; Figure S6A).
GC B cells depend on GC Tfh cells for their survival and prolifer-
ation; as such, the ratio of GC B cells to GC Tfh cells can be an
indicator of the functional capacity of GC Tfh cell help (Gonzalez-
Figueroa et al., 2017; Havenar-Daughton et al., 2016). The ratio
of GC B cells to GC Tfh cells was significantly higher after
booster immunizations, suggesting an increased Tfh helper ca-
pacity (p < 0.0001; Figure 6C). Subsets of GC Tfh cells were iden-
tified (Figures 6D and S6B); these included FoxP3+CXCR5+
T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells and CXCR3+ GC Tfh cells, the
latter of which are Th1 biased and could have a reduced func-
tional helper capacity (Locci et al., 2013; Ueno et al., 2015).
Both CXCR3+ and FoxP3+ GC Tfh cells were detected as minor
populations among total GC Tfh cells in Env-trimer-immunized

 RMs (Figures 6E and 6F), but neither correlated with nAb titer
(Figures S6C and S6D). In contrast, nAb titer correlated with total
GC B cell frequency at multiple time points (Figure S6E). Overall,
the correlations between nAb titers and GC B cells and GC Tfh
cells support a central role for GC biology in the generation of
HIV nAbs by immunization.
No Gender Differences in nAb Generation
Human females have a higher propensity for developing auto-
immunity and also generate higher Ab titers to immunization
than males (Klein and Flanagan, 2016). The large cohort of
immunized RMs permitted an examination of age, weight,
and gender effects on immunization responses (Figures
S6F–S6K; all data are listed in Table S1). GC B cell fre-
quencies were higher in male than in female RMs after the
second and third immunizations (Figure 6G). Gender differ-
ences in GC B cell frequency were more apparent when
only the BG505-SOSIP.664-immunized RMs were considered
(n = 30; Figure S6K). However, there was no statistically signif-
icant difference in BG505 nAb titers between male and female
RMs (Figure 6H).
Env-Trimer-Immunized Animals Recognize a Diversity
of Autologous Neutralization Epitopes
Induction of autologous tier 2 nAbs in NHPs by immunization has
been a high bar, and there have been very limited successes over
the past three decades. Nevertheless, the ultimate goal of HIV
vaccine efforts is the induction of broad nAb responses at suffi-
cient titers to confer protection against globally diverse HIV
strains. To rationally steer the immune response toward broadly
neutralizing epitopes, it is necessary to understand the epitopes
targeted by nAbs after Env trimer immunization. To map the epi-
topes targeted by the autologous tier 2 nAbs, we selected the
nine RMs displaying the highest BG505 neutralization titers,
ranging from 1:628 to 1:5,453. D368R-mutated gp120 fully ab-
sorbed the tier 2 neutralizing responses in all tested animals,
indicating that the targeted epitopes are on monomeric gp120
and are unlikely to be the CD4 binding site, for which D368 bind-
ing interactions are generally essential (Figures 7A and S7A).
Linear BG505 V3 peptides did not compete with nAb activity
from any of the sera (Figures 7A and S7A). To refine targeted
epitopes within gp120, we evaluated sera for neutralization
of pseudovirus glycan variants. BG505 variant S241N P291S
N332 introduces glycans at positions N241 and N289 to fill
in the ‘‘glycan hole’’ that is targeted in about two-thirds of
BG505-SOSIP-immunized rabbits (McCoy et al., 2016). Four of
nine RMs displayed a >2-fold titer decrease on BG505 S241N
P291S N332 virus (Figures 7B and S7B), indicating that the
hole is targeted in some RMs. When tested on the BG505
P240T S241N N332 virus, which only partially fills in the glycan
hole and corrects for an unusual angling of the N241 glycan,
only one of nine animals displayed a 2-fold reduction in nAb titer,
suggesting that the majority of hole-directed nAbs center on the
N289 site (Figure 7B). However, even for the animals that did
target the hole, the response was less dominant for RMs than
for rabbits, and other neutralizing responses were most likely
present. Finally, sera were tested against BG505 T332 pseudo-
virus, which lacks the glycan at position N332, the central glycan
of a frequently targeted broadly neutralizing epitope cluster
(Landais et al., 2016; Walker et al., 2010). None of the RMs
showed evidence of targeting this epitope cluster (Figure 7B).
In sum, the top neutralizer RMs recognized diverse nAb epitopes
on gp120, including but not limited to the N241-N289 region.
Induction of Neutralization Breadth after Env Trimer
Immunization
We used a commonly used panel of 12 heterologous tier 2 vi-
ruses representative of global HIV strain diversity (deCamp
et al., 2014) to assess neutralization breadth. Remarkably, the
majority of top neutralizer animals tested were able to neutralize
three to four viruses of the 12-virus panel at moderate potency
(Figure 7C). The MG505 A2 virus diverges from BG505 by only
17 amino acids. Thus, we used MG505 A2 as an alternative
approach to measure breadth. Although almost all animals in
this study developed nAbs to BG505 pseudovirus, only 15% of
animals neutralized MG505 A2 (n = 12/78; Figure 7D). Among an-
imals that neutralized MG505 A2, peak BG505 nAb GMTs were
significantly above average (1:460 versus 1:99 GMT; Figure S7C),
suggesting that animals with higher autologous neutralization
responses had a higher likelihood of developing neutralization
breadth. BG505 and MG505 A2 neutralization titers in those
animals roughly correlated (Figure 7E). The tier 2 neutralizing
epitopes on MG505 A2 could be mapped to the V1-loop for three
of the nine top neutralizer RMs, which could be indicative of the
BG505 neutralizing epitopes (Figures S7D–S7F). Overall, some
neutralization breadth was observed for animals immunized
with BG505 trimer, particularly among those with high BG505
autologous nAb titers.
DISCUSSION
The SOSIP molecule, with its close mimicry of the native HIV en-
velope spike, is a promising component of an HIV vaccine to
induce protective Abs (Sanders and Moore, 2017). However, a
concern has been the rather inconsistent induction of nAbs by
SOSIP immunization in NHPs, particularly given that NHPs are
often seen as a good model for predicting human responses to
vaccination. Here, we now show reliable induction of nAbs after
BG505 SOSIP.664 immunization.
Four features of the immunization protocol could have contrib-
uted to this success: (1) a longer time interval between immuni-
zations, (2) a strong adjuvant, (3) bilateral immunizations,
and (4) s.c. administration. First, a 0-8-24 week immunization
schedule was used. The longer interval between immunizations
could have allowed the GC response to more fully mature after
each immunization, thus generating the somatic hypermutation
(SHM) needed for gaining B cell receptor affinity for neutralizing
epitopes. Indeed, we demonstrated that an 8 week boost was
more effective than a 6 week boost at inducing GC B cells and
nAbs. Second, the strong GC-inducing adjuvant ISCOMATRIX
was used. ISCOMATRIX had been used in some, but not all, pre-
vious studies of SOSIP trimer immunization in RMs. Third, bilat-
eral immunizations were used to increase the number of draining
LNs and putatively engage twice as many antigen-specific CD4
T cells and B cells specific to neutralizing epitopes. Fourth, s.c.
immunization was directly compared with i.m. immunization
and proved to be significantly superior in terms of both the rate
of development and the magnitude of the induced nAb response.

 s.c. immunizations permit more efficient drainage to surrounding
LNs than i.m. immunization. An increase in intact native-like
Env trimer reaching GCs within draining LNs most likely encour-
ages SHM and favors B cells with nAb specificities over those
with non-neutralizing specificities, such as those targeting Env-
breakdown products. Bilateral s.c. immunizations of BG505
SOSIP.664 given with a strong adjuvant at lengthier boosting in-
tervals induced strong nAb responses in the majority of RMs.
Also, in contrast to earlier studies, our study generated sub-
stantial tier 2 nAb titers by week 10 after only two immuniza-
tions. The immunization parameters outlined above—adjuvant,
timing, and bilateral s.c. injection—most likely contributed to
the rapid nAb generation, which was more rapid than the
typical development of autologous nAbs after 3–6 months in
HIV-infected individuals (Richman et al., 2003; Wei et al.,
2003). It is encouraging that autologous nAbs can potentially
be developed faster after protein immunization than HIV infec-
tion, suggesting the possibility of developing broadly neutral-
izing Abs via serial immunizations faster than they develop in
HIV-infected people.
To interrogate the immunological underpinnings of successful
nAb generation, we acquired LN FNAs throughout the study, al-
lowing us to examine GCs within the draining LNs. GC B cell fre-
quencies measured at just 3 weeks after the priming immuniza-
tion predicted the development of nAb generation after further
immunizations. Moreover, the GC B cell frequency tracked
with nAb titer after each immunization, emphasizing the pivotal
role of GCs in the generation of nAb responses. Optimally
engaging GC responses through the choice of adjuvant, immuni-
zation schedule, and antigen delivery is a means of positively
affecting nAb generation and should bear careful consideration.
Of note, the third immunization accomplished relatively little
beyond moderately increasing the nAb titers of RMs with low ti-
ters after the second immunization.
Among all immunization groups, we obtained the highest
nAb titers by extending immunogen release. This approach ap-
peared to outperform the conventional immunization strategy
with the same immunogen. A 2 week osmotic pump coupled
with a bolus injection of immunogen to mimic a dose-esca-
lating immunization significantly increased tier 2 nAb titers,
favorably shifted Ab-response kinetics, and enhanced GC
activity. One caveat is that the extended-immunogen-release
group received a total of 200 mg immunogen per immunization,
whereas 100 mg was used in the control group. It is therefore
possible that the larger total antigen dose could have been
beneficial for nAb development. However, we observed only
marginal differences between 20 and 100 mg immunizations,
supporting the interpretation that the increased titers in the
extended-immunogen-release group were due to the immuni-
zation strategy. Future studies with dose-matched groups
are needed. Nevertheless, the data show that nAb develop-
ment was dramatically modulated in the extended-immu-
nogen-release group.
Liposome presentation is an appealing means of presenting
Env trimers to minimize exposure of non-neutralizing epitopes.
Disappointingly, we found no significant improvements in tier
2 nAb titers between liposome-displayed and soluble Env tri-
mers. This could have arisen for several potential reasons,
including the stability of the liposome preparations in vivo, which
will require further exploration before any definitive conclusions
can be drawn about the utility of liposome-displayed trimers.
Previous studies have indicated that tier 1 non-nAb epitopes
might interfere with induction of tier-2-epitope-directed nAb re-
sponses, given that naive B cells with tier 2 specificities can be
rare or have low affinity and be disadvantaged in the competition
for antigen and T cell help (Havenar-Daughton et al., 2017;
McGuire et al., 2014). Consequently, efforts have been made
to design soluble native Env trimers with improved antigenic
properties, whereby epitopes such as the V3-loop tip and the
CD4-induced epitopes are constrained in conformations that
preclude Ab recognition. We tested several of the latest-genera-
tion stabilized BG505 trimer designs head-to-head. The BG505
Olio6 designs showed the strongest reduction in tier 1 nAb titers.
However, limiting the V3-loop tip Ab response did not redirect
the immune response sufficiently to improve tier 2 nAb titers.
This could be because other specificities, such as epitopes on
the exposed base of the trimer, still precede the neutralizing
epitope specificities in the immunodominance hierarchy (Have-
nar-Daughton et al., 2017).
Finally, the autologous tier 2 nAb responses generated by
BG505 Env trimer immunogens in this study are an important
benchmark for the HIV vaccine field. Cross-reactive tier 2 nAb
breadth is the next important goal. In using a single BG505 strain
for immunization, we did not expect to generate a broad nAb
response, and in the majority of RMs, indeed we found no evi-
dence of MG505 cross-reactive tier 2 nAbs. Some nAb breadth
was detected on a 12-virus global panel in RMs with the highest
BG505 nAb titers. RMs immunized with BG505 Env trimer recog-
nized a larger diversity of neutralizing epitopes than did rabbits,
which is encouraging for future development of nAb breadth.
In addition, the new immunization regimen rapidly and reproduc-
ibly induced autologous nAbs, which will be a boon to future
immunization studies aimed at generating nAb breadth because
it will allow for faster testing and iteration of novel immunogen
designs.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Rhesus Macaques
Outbred Indian RMs (Macaca mulatta) were sourced and housed at Alphagenesis, Yemasee, SC and maintained in accordance
with NIH guidelines. These studies were approved by the appropriate Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC).
None of the NHPs were previously enrolled in other studies, and animals were randomly allocated to experimental groups. The
majority of macaques were 3–4 years of age at the time of first immunization (Figure S6F). Body weight and sex of animals are listed
in Figures S6G and S6H.
METHOD DETAILS
Macaque Immunizations
Animals were immunized at 3 time points: week 0, week 8, and week 24. All immunizations were administered as split doses.
Unless otherwise stated, each immunization consisted of two s.c. injections of 50 mg of Env trimer protein + 37.5 units (U) of
ISCOMATRIX adjuvant (CSL), composed of cholesterol, phospholipid, and saponin (Sun et al., 2009), in sterile phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) diluent for a total of 100 mg of Env trimer protein + 75 U of ISCOMATRIX per immunization per animal. s.c. immuni-
zations were given in a volume of 0.5mL with a 1 inch, 25-gauge needle at the medial inner mid-thigh of each leg. The s.c. injection
technique consists of making a ‘‘skin tent’’ and inserting the needle into the s.c. space at a 45� angle. The i.m. immunizations were
administered in the quadriceps muscle of each thigh with a 1 inch, 25-gauge needle at a 45� angle (0.5 mL/thigh). One group of
animals was immunized with a lower total dose of immunogen (total, 20 mg of Env trimer protein + 75 U of ISCOMATRIX). The s.c.
BG505 SOSIP.664 immunization group included 12 animals to increase statistical power in comparisons to other groups of
6 animals.
s.c. pump immunization (ALZET, Model 2002) and bolus injection were used to mimic an escalating dose immunization. Each
14-day osmotic pump filled with 50 mg of BG505.v5.2 SOSIP + 37.5 U ISCOMATRIX was implanted under the skin of each inner thigh
and sutured in place to prevent potential removal by the animal. 14 days later, 50 mg BG505.v5.2 SOSIP + 37.5 U ISCOMATRIX (CSL)
was given via s.c. bolus injection in each inner thigh as described above. Pumps were removed at day 18 to avoid interference with
the bolus immunization.
Sample Collection
Serum was collected in SST Vaccutainer tubes (BD Biosciences) and processed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Mul-
tiple aliquots of 0.5 mL were frozen at �80�C. Whole blood was collected in K2 EDTA Vaccutainer tubes (BD Biosciences) for plasma
and PBMC isolation. Multiple aliquots of 0.5 mL of plasma were frozen at �80�C. PBMCs were isolated using Thermo Fisher Scientific
Nunc EZFlip Conical Centrifuge Tubes per manufacturer’s instructions. PBMCs were isolated, counted, and re-suspended at 1 3 107
cells/mL in FBS containing 10% DMSO. Aliquots were subsequently frozen in 1 mL vials using a Mr. Frosty freezing container
(Nalgene, cooling rate of 1�C / minute) and placed in a �80�C freezer. The following day PBMC samples were moved to storage
in a liquid nitrogen freezer tank.

 LN FNAs were used to sample both right and left inguinal areas inferred to be the primary draining LNs, 3 weeks post each
immunization (Havenar-Daughton et al., 2016). A veterinarian performed the LN FNAs on palpable superficial inguinal LNs. Forceps
were used to isolate and elevate the LN. A 22-gauge, 1’’ needle attached to a 3 mL syringe was inserted into the LN and moved in
a back and forth motion four times. No suction was applied. Cells in the needle were ejected into cold RPMI + 10% FBS media in
15 mL tubes and the needle was flushed repeatedly to collect all cells. 15 mL tubes were filled with cold media, wrapped in bubble
wrap to prevent freezing, packaged with frozen cold packs, and shipped the same day for further processing and analysis at Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Red blood cell lysis was generally not necessary, but was performed on a few samples using
ACK lysis buffer for 3 min. All LN FNA samples were stained and fixed for flow cytometry within 18–24 hr of biopsy. Successful LN
FNAs were obtained (i.e., all the way to quantifiable FACS data) in 98% (541 of 550) of cases. A median of 3 3 106 cells was
recovered.
Evans Blue Dye Extraction and Quantification
One mL (72 hr study) or 0.5 mL (48 hr study) of a 0.2% Evans Blue dye solution was delivered via s.c. or i.m. injection into the thigh of
RMs, respectively. LNs were harvested after 48 hr (one animal) or 72 hr (two animals) and fixed in freshly made 4% PFA for 24 hr.
Each LN was cut into small pieces and incubated in 500 mL of formamide (Sigma, Cat# F-7503) for 24 hr at 60�C to extract the
dye. Fluorescence of the extracted dye in supernatant was measured (excitation at 620 nm, emission at 680 nm) using a Tecan Infinite
M200 Pro plate reader and quantified using a standard curve. LNs injected with known titrated amounts of Evans Blue and processed
in the same manner showed that the extraction process recovered 77 ± 5% of LN-associated dye; importantly this efficiency was
independent on the amount of dye present.
BG505 Native-like Env Trimer Immunogens
Expression of BG505 SOSIP.664 Variants
BG505 SOSIP.664 (also referred to as BG505 SOSIP.v3.2 (de Taeye et al., 2015) was expressed in stable HEK293T cell lines for ma-
terial used in all BG505 SOSIP.664 groups except for one i.m. immunized group, in which BG505 SOSIP.664 was stably expressed in
CHO cell lines (Chung et al., 2014). We found no significant differences in immunogenicity between RM immunized i.m. with HEK293T
or CHO cell-produced BG505 SOSIP.664 and subsequently combined data from the two groups for increased statistical power.
BG505 SOSIP.664 from both cell lines was purified using a 2G12-affinity column followed by size exclusion chromatography
(SEC). These proteins had no His-tag. Fractions corresponding to trimer were pooled and concentrated down to between
0.3-0.5 mg/mL, filter sterilized, aliquoted, and flash frozen. The aliquots were stored at �80�C until dry ice shipment to Alphagenesis
Inc. BG505 SOSIP.v4.1 (de Taeye et al., 2015) and BG505 SOSIP.v5.2 (A.T.d.l.P. et al., unpublished data) were expressed in
HEK293F cells by transient co-transfection with furin. BG505 SOSIP.v4.1 contains a A316W mutation, which improves hydrophobic
packing and stability of the V3-loop, and a E64K mutation, which reduces spontaneous sampling of the CD4-bound ‘‘open’’ trimer
conformation. The BG505 SOSIP.v5.2 builds upon the v4.1 design, with the addition of a second disulfide bond between gp120 and
gp41 to further increase trimer stability. The proteins were purified using methods described elsewhere (Pugach et al., 2015), with
either 2G12-affinity (BG505 SOSIP.v4.1) or PGT145-affinity columns (BG505 SOSIP.v5.2) followed by SEC. These proteins had no
His-tag. Fractions corresponding to trimer were pooled and concentrated down to �2.3 mg/mL (BG505 SOSIP.v4.1) or �0.8 mg/
mL (BG505 SOSIP.v5.2). Structural validation of trimers was performed by analyzing negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) 2D
class averages following methods described previously (de Taeye et al., 2015). All samples were filter sterilized prior to aliquoting
and flash freezing. Aliquots were stored at �80�C until dry ice shipment to the Alphagenesis Inc.
Expression of BG505 NFL Trimers
The BG505 NFL sequence was previously reported (Sharma et al., 2015) and includes a C-terminal His-tag. BG505 NFL was tran-
siently expressed in HEK293F cells. In brief, 350 mg of BG505 NFL plasmid DNA was mixed with 1 mL of 293-fectin transfection re-
agent (Invitrogen), incubated for 20 min at 37�C and subsequently transfected into 1 l of 293F cells with cell density of 1.5 million/ml
and 99% viability. The cells were grown for 4 days in a CO2 incubator shaker at 37�C. Cells were harvested at 4000 rpm at 25�C for
30 min and the culture supernatant was sterile filtrated (0.22 mm, Nalgene) to remove any remaining cell debris. The BG505 NFL trimer
was purified via affinity chromatography by passing the supernatant over Galanthus nivalis (GLN)-lectin-agarose (Vector Labora-
tories) columns at 4�C. Columns were washed extensively with PBS containing 500 mM NaCl, followed by PBS containing
10 mM methyl-a-D-mannopyranoside. Bound protein was eluted with PBS containing 500 mM NaCl and 500 mM methyl-a-D-man-
nopyranoside. The eluted BG505 NFL protein was concentrated in Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter tubes (100 kDa MWCO, Millipore)
to 500 ml and subjected to SEC using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column, to purify the trimer population. SEC eluted fractions were
analyzed by native-PAGE, trimer fractions were pooled, and then further purified by negative selection using an F105-Ab affinity col-
umn. Aberrant trimers bind to F105 mAbs, while the flow through contains 100% native-like, well-ordered BG505 NFL trimers. A
detailed protocol for negative selection using an F105-Ab column is described elsewhere (Sharma et al., 2015). The purified,
native-like, BG505 NFL trimer immunogen was characterized by blue native-PAGE, ELISA, and Biolayer interferometry (BLI) binding
analysis before vaccine formulation. Here, ELISA and BLI binding assays were used as diagnostic tools to assess the structural integ-
rity and native-like features of BG505 NFL trimers. In both assay formats, strong binding of trimer sensitive bNAbs (PGT145,
PGDM1400, VRC26, PG16, VRC06, and PGT151) and other select bNAbs (2G12, VRC01, and PGT121) was detected, while only
very weak to no binding of non-neutralizing Abs (F105, b6, F240, and 7B2) was detected. Thus all BG505 NFL protein used in RM
immunizations was entirely composed of well-ordered, native-like trimers.

 Expression of BG505 Olio6 and Related Trimers
The BG505 Olio6, BG505 Olio6 CD4-KO and BG505 MD39 CD4-KO proteins were designed with computational protein design
methods using the Rosetta Design platform. The trimers are mutational variants of BG505 MD39 (Steichen et al., 2016). BG505
Olio6 is based on the BG505 SOSIP MD39 design (Steichen et al., 2016) that contained sequence modifications that increase trimer
stability and yield, and also reduced V3 reactivity compared to BG505 SOSIP.664. Further stabilization of the V3-loop in BG505 Olio6
was achieved through computational design of complementary mutations in the V3-loop and the underlying gp120 (non-V3 gp120
mutations not shown in Figure 3A), creating a hydrophobic cluster of residues to anchor V3. BG505 Olio6 was then modified via multi-
state structural design to reduce CD4 binding affinity while retaining CD4-binding-site-directed bnAb affinity, resulting in BG505
Olio6 CD4-KO. This CD4 mutation is hypothesized to increase the effective dose of circulating immunogen in vivo and decrease
the exposure of CD4-binding-induced non-neutralizing epitopes by eliminating human CD4-induced trimer opening. BG505 Olio6,
BG505 Olio6 CD4-KO and BG505 MD39 CD4-KO proteins included His-tags and were purified by Ni++ affinity chromatography fol-
lowed by SEC, as described previously (Steichen et al., 2016). Design and biophysical characterization of BG505 Olio6 and BG505
Olio6 CD4-KO are described elsewhere (D.W.K. et al., unpublished data).
Liposome Synthesis and Characterization
Trimer-conjugated liposomes were prepared as previously described with some modifications (Steichen et al., 2016). In brief, uni-
lamellar liposomes were comprised of DMPC:cholesterol:DGS-NTA(Ni):MPB lipids in a 61.5:28.5:5:5 molar ratio. Lipids 1,2-dimyr-
istoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[(N-(5-amino-1-carboxypentyl) iminodiacetic acid)succinyl]
(nickel salt) (DGS-NTA(Ni)) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[4-(p-maleimidophenyl)butyramide] (sodium
salt) (MPB) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. Cholesterol was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Liposomes were synthesized
by lipid film rehydration and membrane extrusion, followed by post-synthesis binding of 6xHis-Cys C-terminal modified trimer for 1 hr
at 37�C in PBS followed by overnight incubation at 4�C with rotation. Covalent coupling could also be performed using trimers without
C-terminal cysteines for proteins containing a lysine directly adjacent to the 63 His-tags, as maleimides also react with primary
amines in the absence of cysteine; coupling in this manner showed similar trimer retention in serum. Non-covalent liposomes
were prepared similarly without MPB lipid, with DMPC:cholesterol:DGS-NTA(Ni) lipids in a 66.5:28.5:5 mole ratio. Unconjugated
trimer was removed by size exclusion chromatography using a Sepharose CL-2B resin (Sigma). Total conjugated trimer was
quantified by ELISA in the presence of 1% triton-X and 100 mM imidazole to fully disrupt liposomes and Ni-6xHis interactions,
respectively. Trimer was captured on Nunc MaxiSorp plates coated with (mouse Fc) VRCO1 and detected using PGT151, followed
by secondary detection with a goat anti-human IgG-HRP conjugate. Antigenic profiles were similarly determined by ELISA on intact
liposomes captured on VRC01-coated plates. To ensure batch-to-batch homogeneity, trimer-conjugated liposomes were also
characterized by dynamic light scattering and cryo-electron microscopy (Jeol 2100F TEM) in the Swanson Biotechnology Center
at the Koch Institute, MIT.
For stability analysis, trimer-conjugated liposomes were incubated with 20% (final concentration) rhesus serum or PBS (control) for
up to 14 days after which released trimer was separated from trimer-conjugated liposomes by size exclusion chromatography as
described above. Intact trimer in each elution fraction was quantified exactly as described above using PGT151 as the detection
Ab. Serum stability was determined to be equivalent (data not shown) for covalent liposomes functionalized with trimers either
with or without C-terminal cysteines (but with a neighboring lysine).
Pseudovirus Neutralization Assays
Replication incompetent HIV pseudovirus was produced by co-transfecting env plasmids with an env-deficient backbone plasmid
(pSG3Denv) in HEK293T cells in a 1:2 ratio, using the X-tremeGENE 9 transfection reagent (Roche). Pseudovirus was harvested after
48–72 hr by sterile-filtration (0.22 mm) of cell culture supernatants, and neutralization was tested by incubating pseudovirus and
serum or mAbs for 1 hr at 37�C before transferring them onto TZM-bl cells as previously described (Sok et al., 2016). For competition
neutralization assays, BG505 D368R gp120 or BG505 V3-peptide (TRPNNNTRKSIRIGPGQAFYATG) was added at a concentration
of 25mg/ml. Similar assays were performed at Duke University (Li et al., 2005). Neutralization is measured in duplicate wells within
each experiment. BG505 nAb titers for group comparisons were measured in three or more independent experiments that were sub-
sequently averaged. The BG505 time course neutralization data shown in Figures 1C, 4C, and 4G were generated in three large ex-
periments, respectively, to test sera from all time points side-by-side, thus ensuring the highest nAb titer comparability between time
points. Of note, all neutralization assays used serum samples, as plasma samples, depending on the anti-coagulant used, can inter-
fere with TZM-bl neutralization assays. Neutralization was tested starting at 1:10 serum dilutions followed by nine serial 3-fold dilu-
tions to ensure highest sensitivity and range of detection. Neutralization IC50 titers were calculated using the ‘‘One site – Fit logIC50’’
regression in Graphpad Prism v7.0. IC50 nAb titers of incomplete neutralization curves that reached at least 50%, but less than 90%
maximal neutralization, were calculated by constraining the regression fit through 0% and 100% neutralization, to ensure accurate
calculation of half-way (50%) nAb titers. All neutralization titers are reported as IC50 titers. All nAb titer data panels show geometric
mean titers with geometric SD.
BG505 pseudovirus neutralization was tested using the BG505.W6M.ENV.C2 isolate (Wu et al., 2006), carrying the T332N
mutation to restore the N332 glycosylation site, unless stated otherwise. The related maternal MG505 A2 and H3 isolates
(MG505.W0M.ENV.A2 and MG505.W0M.ENV.A2, respectively) only differ in 2%–3% in amino acid residues (17 and 30 aa changes,
respectively) compared to BG505, and were used to gauge neutralization breadth and to map serum nAb epitopes (Wu et al., 2006).

Immunity 46, 1073–1088.e1–e6, June 20, 2017
 All indicated mutant pseudoviruses were created by site-directed mutagenesis of the respective env plasmid and verified by Sanger
sequencing. All mutant pseudoviruses were checked for intact antigenicity of epitopes not affected by the respective mutations
(see Figure S7B). Heterologous neutralization breadth was tested on a panel of 12 cross-clade isolates, reported to be most repre-
sentative of larger virus panels composed of global isolates from diverse clades (deCamp et al., 2014).
SOSIP.664 Serum IgG ELISA Binding Assays
Microlon 96-well plates (Corning) were coated overnight with streptavidin at 2.5 mg/mL (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or mouse anti-His
Ab at 2.5 mg/mL (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 2.5 mg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 50 mL per well. Plates were then washed
four to five times with PBS-tween (0.05%) and blocked with PBS + 3% BSA for 1 hr at room temperature. If capturing biotinylated
BG505 SOSIP.664-Avi gp140, BG505 NFL-His gp140, or BG505-Avi gp120, proteins were added at 1 mg/mL in PBS + 1% BSA for
2 hr at room temperature. Plates were then washed four to five times with PBS-tween (0.05%) and serially diluted sera in PBS + 1%
BSA were then added for 1 hr at room temperature. Plates were then washed four to five times with PBS-tween (0.05%) and alkaline
phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was added for 1 hr at a 1:1,000 dilution (final concentra-
tion 0.33 mg/mL) in PBS + 1% BSA at room temperature. Plates were then washed four to five times with PBS-tween (0.05%)
and absorption at 405 nm was measured following addition of phosphatase substrate in alkaline phosphatase buffer. We
calculated half maximal EC50 binding titers using GraphPad Prism v7.0. All ELISA Ab data panels show geometric mean titers
with geometric SD.
Peptide IgG ELISA Binding Assays
V3-peptdie ELISA assays were performed exactly as SOSIP.664 ELISAs, with the following modifications. For the BG505 Olio6
versus WT cross-binding comparison (Figure 3D) and to assess V3-peptide antigenicity (Figure S3D), Microlon 96-well plates
(Corning) were coated overnight with streptavidin at 2.5 mg/mL (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
After blocking, C-terminally biotinylated BG505 V3-peptides (Olio6 TAPNNFTVKSIRIGPGQ-AFYYMGGAGK-biotin or SOSIP.664
TRPNNNTRKSIRIGPGQAFYATGGAGK-biotin) were added at 2.5 mg/mL in PBS + 1% BSA for 2 hr at room temperature. All other
V3-peptide binding assays were done by directly coating BG505 V3-peptide (TRPNNNTRKSIRIGPGQAFYATG) to Microlon 96-
well plates at 2.5 mg/mL in PBS overnight, with comparable results to biotin/streptavidin capture (data not shown). His-tag peptide
ELISA assays were performed as the SOSIP.664 ELISAs above, with the following modification: a N-terminally biotinylated His-tag
peptide (biotin-ALDGGGGSHHHHHHHH) was coated as the antigen (2.5mg/ml in PBS + 1% BSA). All ELISA Ab data panels show
geometric mean titers with geometric SD.
Flow Cytometry
Fresh cells from LN FNA samples were washed, counted, and stained with a panel of antibodies (see key resource table) to identify
GC Tfh cells and GC B cells. Each animal was immunized in both the right and left legs, yielding two (right and left) draining inguinal LN
samples per animal. Samples were acquired with a LSR-II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). FlowJo 9.9 (Tree Star) was used for anal-
ysis. Example gating schemes are shown in Figure S1E. All cell frequency data panels show mean frequency and SD.
Plasmablast ELISPOT
BG505-specific Ab-secreting cells (ASCs) were detected by Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSpot (ELISPOT) assay on fresh cells from
blood, obtained 5 days after the second immunization. 96-well multi-screen HTS HA filter plates, opaque (Millipore) were coated
with 20 mg/mL of unconjugated Galanthus nivalis lectin (Vector labs) to capture antigen. Plates were coated overnight, washed,
and blocked with complete RPMI medium at 37�C. 20 mg/mL of BG505 SOSIP.664 protein (laboratory of J.P. Moore, Cornell Uni-
versity) was added and incubated 1 hr at 37�C. All washes for GNL-BG505 plates were performed with PBS only. Plates were
washed, mononuclear cells were plated in 3-fold serial dilutions, and incubated overnight 37�C. Plates were washed and incu-
bated for 2 hr at RT with anti-monkey biotin conjugated IgG (Rockland) diluted at 1/1,000 in PBS with 1% FBS solution. Plates
were washed and HRP avidin D (Vector labs) was added at 1/1,000 dilution and incubated for 2 hr at RT. The last wash was
performed with PBS-T followed by PBS. An AEC Substrate Set (BD Biosciences) was used to develop spots. Plates were scanned
and counted at Zellnet Consulting using the Immunospot CTL image acquisition (Cellular Technologies). Spots are reported as
antigen-specific ASCs per million mononuclear cells.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Graphpad Prism v7.0 was used for all statistical analyses. The significance of differences in neutralization and binding data between
groups was calculated using unpaired, two-tailed Mann-Whitney U tests. Correlations between neutralization and binding datasets
were calculated using log transformed Ab titer values in two-tailed Pearson correlation tests.
GC B cell and GC Tfh cell frequencies followed a normal distribution. Therefore, paired Student’s t tests were used for evaluating
differences between samples obtained from the same animal at different time points, and unpaired Student’s t tests were used for
evaluating differences among groups. Two-tailed Pearson correlation tests were used to assess correlations between GC B cell
frequencies or GC Tfh cell frequencies and BG505 nAb titers or BG505 binding titers. All Ab titers were log transformed. Pearson
r values and two-tailed p values are reported unless otherwise stated. Not significant is denoted as ‘‘ns.’’ All nAb titer data panels

 show geometric mean titers with geometric standard deviation. All ELISA Ab data panels show geometric mean titers with geometric
standard deviation. All cell frequency data panels show mean frequency and standard deviation. Sample sizes (n) are provided in the
respective figure legends.
DATA AND SOFTWARE AVAILABILITY
We provide the great majority of neutralization and ELISA binding data of all NHPs in the study in Table S1, which is provided as an
Excel file to allow for easy independent analysis.
