Livestock vaccinations translate into increased human
capital and school attendance by girls

To fulfill the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it is useful to understand whether and how
specific agricultural interventions improve human health, educational opportunity, and food security. In sub-Saharan
Africa, 75% of the population is engaged in small-scale farming, and 80% of these households keep livestock, which
represent a critical asset and provide protection against economic shock. For the 50 million pastoralists, livestock play
an even greater role. Livestock productivity for pastoralist households is constrained by multiple factors, including
infectious disease. East Coast fever, a tick-borne protozoal disease, is the leading cause of calf mortality in large re-
gions of eastern and Southern Africa. We examined pastoralist decisions to adopt vaccination against East Coast fever
and the economic outcomes of adoption. Our estimation strategy provides an integrated model of adoption and
impact that includes direct effects of vaccination on livestock health and productivity outcomes, as well as indirect
effects on household expenditures, such as child education, food, and health care. On the basis of a cross-sectional
study of Kenyan pastoralist households, we found that vaccination provides significant net income benefits from
reduction in livestock mortality, increased milk production, and savings by reducing antibiotic and acaricide treat-
ments.Households directed the increased incomeresultingfrom EastCoastfevervaccinationintochildhood education
and food purchase. These indirect effects of livestock vaccination provide a positive impact on rural, livestock-
dependent families, contributing to poverty alleviation at the household level and more broadly to achieving SDGs.
INTRODUCTION
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set targets for poverty
reduction and the consequent impact of poverty on education, health,
and human opportunity (1). Despite notable gains in relation to some
SDG targets, Africa continues to have the highest rates of persistent
poverty and food insecurity in the world (2). In sub-Saharan Africa,
more than half of the population is engaged in small-scale farming (3).
The majority of households in the farming sector keep one or more
livestock species, which not only represent wealth, income, and pro-
tection against economic shock but also are a major source of high-
protein nutrition, which is critically important in a continent where
childhood stunting remains prevalent (4, 5). For the more than
50 million African pastoralists for whom livestock raising is the
primary economic activity, livestock play an even greater role in eco-
nomic and food security (6).
Livestock productivity for pastoralist households is constrained
by multiple factors, including infectious disease. A longitudinal ex-
amination of indigenous zebu cattle during the first year of life in
Kenya revealed an all-cause mortality rate of 16.1 (13.0 to 19.2; 95%
confidence interval) per 100 calf years (7). Using a Cox proportional
hazard model, East Coast fever (ECF) resulting from infection with
Theileria parva was identified as the main cause of death, responsible
for 40% of all mortality within the first year (7). Mortality due to
ECF is preventable by vaccination, with efficacy demonstrated both
in experimental challenge trials and in field trials with natural expo-
sure (8). Given the high impact of ECF on cattle and the importance
of cattle as financial assets and insurance instruments for the eco-
nomic and food security of pastoralists, we developed econometric
models of the ECF vaccine adoption decision to estimate both direct
effects of vaccine adoption on livestock health and productivity and
indirect effects on household expenditures that are directed toward
specific SDG goals, including education, food, and health.
We present findings from pastoralist households centered on their
decision to vaccinate (or not to vaccinate) against ECF and the impacts
of that decision on household welfare. In doing so, we present a novel
framework that extends beyond the direct animal health and pro-
ductivity effects typically measured from a livestock-centric viewpoint
to more fully capture the human development benefits of vaccination
against a highly prevalent livestock disease. This framework provides
an evidence base for emphasizing broader household decisions and
their role on the impact of interventions, such as vaccination delivery.
In doing so, we demonstrate the importance of using econometric
analysis at the household level for tracking how economic gains are
directed toward human welfare improvement and for meeting broad
social goals, such as the SDGs.
RESULTS
Results from ECF vaccine adoption are reported first, followed by
impacts on antibiotic and acaracide use, livestock productivity and
value, and household expenditures, including those for food, health,
and education. Tables S1 and S2 present variable definitions and de-
scriptive statistics.
ECF vaccine adoption
We examine the factors that influenced household decisions to vacci-
nate calves, 1- to 2-year-old cattle (that is, heifers and bullocks), and
adult cattle (>2 years) in the past 12 months. Vaccination costs matter
in theory for the adoption decisions, but because there is little or no
variation in vaccination costs reported by households, they were ex-
cluded as a regressor. Three explanatory variables are consistently as-
sociated with the decision to vaccinate across all age categories. First,
the current number of owned livestock is associated with significantly
greater vaccination uptake across all age categories (Table 1, P < 0.01).
Second, the fraction of crossbred cattle, which produce higher quantities

 of milk than indigenous breeds but are more susceptible to severe
disease and death upon ECF infection, is positively related to vacci-
nation across all age groups (Table 1). Third, when animal health
services are obtained from a commercial vendor, there is a significantly
lower vaccination rate (Table 1), an effect that is not observed when
vaccine information is obtained from either other farmers or non-
governmental organizations. The herd owner’s expectation of the
impact of ECF infection on milk production is statistically significant
and positive for the number of adult cattle and calves that are vacci-
nated (9, 10) (Table 1; full regression results are presented in models
S0 to S3 in table S3).
Impacts on antibiotic and acaricide use
In the absence of vaccination, ECF infections can be treated with anti-
biotics to reduce severe morbidity and mortality. ECF infections can
be reduced by periodic treatment of livestock with acaricides to kill the
tick vector before transmission (98% of households reported routinely
applying acaricides). Consequently, we examined whether vaccination
against ECF decreases subsequent use of antibiotics and acaricides.
The instrumental variables used to control for endogeneity are the
predicted numbers of vaccinated cattle from regressions in Table 1.
The effect of a 1% increase in vaccination, conditional on herd size, sig-
nificantly reduced overall antibiotic use by 0.11% for 1- to 2-year-old
cattle (P < 0.01). The marginal effectof vaccinations for 1- to 2-year-old
cattle is 0.30 (on the basis of the elasticity estimate 0.11), which implies
that 10 vaccinations for this age group reduce subsequent antibiotic use
by an average of about three treatments per year, holding herd size con-
stant. Multiplying the marginal effect by the average number of cattle
in the cohort provides antibiotic treatment reductions of 1.89 for an
average herd’s 1- to 2-year-old cattle. On the basis of an estimated
cost per treatment of 1110 Kenyan shillings (Ksh), this provides cost
savings of 2105 Ksh per year. The estimated cost per treatment of
1110 Ksh is the average cost from respondents in the survey, which
is consistent with a previously reported cost of 1000 Ksh per treat-
ment (11). These cost savings do not account for labor and time costs
of antibiotic treatment and are thus an underestimate of total anti-
biotic treatment cost savings. Full regression results for antibiotic use
are provided as model S4 in table S3.
For households who vaccinate for ECF, immunized cattle receive
0.29 fewer acaricide applications per month than do unvaccinated cat-
tle, which corresponds to an average of 3.46 fewer treatments per year
for a vaccinated animal. Given an estimated cost per application of
6 Ksh, this provides a savings of about 21 Ksh per vaccination per
year. This savings does not account for additional savings through
reduction of labor for application. The reduction of acaricide applica-
tions may indirectly amplify the impact of ECF vaccine adoption at
the herd level because decreased acaricide use has been shown to
allow infection with nonpathogenic Theileria species that provide
at least partial protection against ECF due to T. parva (12). Alterna-
tively, the reduction of acaricide use may result in an increase in other
tick-borne diseases, which would likely reduce the net savings from
less frequent acaricide use.
Direct impacts on livestock productivity and value
Households in the survey produced milk, consumed it at home, and
sold it but rarely purchased it. Severe ECF disease results in marked
loss of milk production in cows and can progress to death in cattle of
all ages. A 1% increase in the fraction of vaccinated adults is associated
with a statistically significant 0.08% increase in mean reported milk
production per herd (Table 2). On the basis of sample means, milk
production is about 0.13 liters higher per adult animal with one addi-
tional adult vaccination. For the average adult cohort size, vaccination
provides about 0.27 liters per day per herd on average (66 adult cattle ×
0.13/31 days), or about 96.6 liters per year. At 45 Ksh/liter, this
amounts to a savings of 4347 Ksh per year. This average milk produc-
tion improvement is conditional on several factors, including inci-
dence of ECF infection, proportion of crossbred cattle in the herd,
proportion of lactating cows in the herd, and herd management prac-
tices. Where incidence is higher, ECF burden on milk production will
be greater and, correspondingly, lesser where incidence is lower, so the

 estimate can be interpreted as the weighted average of disease burden
over the entire sample. Both the fraction of crossbred cattle in the herd
and more intensive grazing management practices have a significant
and positive impact on average milk offtake per cow (Table 2).
A higher vaccination rate is associated with fewer ECF deaths for
calves and for the herd as a whole (Table 2). The calf vaccination effect,
represented by an estimated elasticity of −0.086 (P < 0.01), is the
largest source of whole-herd death reduction; the vaccination effect
for all cattle (−0.056) exhibits a smaller effect in magnitude as com-
pared to calves but remains statistically significant at the 10% level.
This age effect is consistent with the incidence of ECF transmission
during the first year of life (7). For calves, the estimated elasticity
implies a marginal effect of 0.033, which means that for every 100 calves
that are vaccinated, 3.3 calves are saved from ECF death (1 for each 30
vaccinations). The average value of a calf based on a market survey
within the study region is approximately 10,000 Ksh. Multiplying the
calf death reduction of 0.033 by the value of a calf provides expected
savings of 330 Ksh per calf vaccination. As with milk production sav-
ings, savings from prevented mortality is conditional on the overall
incidence of ECF within the region and would be higher where ECF
burden is greater and lesser where ECF burden is lower. Table S4
provides results for the full set of analyzed relationships.
Indirect impacts on expenditures in health, education,
and food
To this point, we have reported the direct impacts of vaccination on
cattle productivity and animal health inputs, but economic theory sug-
gests the potential for broader impacts on household decisions and
outcomes. Cattle death from ECF results in less asset wealth in the
form of livestock for a household. This in turn reduces a household’s
capacity to translate livestock wealth into disposable income for
consumable or marketable meat and milk for current consumption
or investment in other capital, such as human health and education.
Although households who vaccinate may also have a higher propen-
sity for consumption and investment in general, the instrumental var-
iable estimation strategy as applied here controls for this propensity
and thereby alleviates bias and inconsistency in parameter estimates.
Table S5 provides the full set of analyzed variables.
ECF vaccinations are positively associated with education ex-
penditures (Table 3). At the mean household level, a 10% increase
in the number of vaccinated cattle (holding herd size constant) results
in a 0.88% increase in education expenditures. The mean educational
expenditure across all households in the study is 44,260 Ksh, implying
that, on average, 406 Ksh more is spent on education for each addi-
tional vaccination. To further understand the consequence of this
finding, we examine the distribution of elasticities across households.
We find that for a 10% increase in the number of vaccinated cattle, the
5% most responsive households (exhibiting the largest elasticities)
would increase their education expenditures by 5.4%. The 10, 50,
and 90% most responsive households increase their education ex-
penditure by 3.5, 1.2, and 0.7%, respectively. In terms of gender, at-
tendance in secondary school by girls is positively associated with
ECF vaccination rates (that is, fewer cattle deaths); for boys, attend-
ance in both primary and secondary schools is negatively associated
with the number of ECF deaths (see table S6).
There is a statistically significant effect (at the 1% level) of ECF vacci-
nationson food(meat,beans, rice, andmaize)consumption expenditures
(Table 3). A 10% increase in the number of vaccinated cattle resulted in a

 0.56% increase in food expenditures. Given that the sample mean
food expenditure is 2701 Ksh per week, 16 KSh more is spent on av-
erage for food per week per vaccination (for a total of about 151 Ksh
per week).
Given that ECF is not a zoonotic disease, no expenditures are re-
quired for prevention or treatment of ECF infections in humans.
However, reductions in income and wealth due to cattle death loss
may still, in principle, affect human health outcomes through effects
on household capacity to invest in health maintenance and treatment
of illness. Yet, we find no statistically significant impact of the number
of ECF vaccinations on human health expenditures, though we do see
significant effects of off-farm income on health expenditures (Table 3).
To the extent that human health expenditures are often unforeseen
income shocks, the finding that ECF vaccination (as an instrument
for on-farm income) does not affect human health expenditures iscor-
roborated by findings of past research (13).
DISCUSSION
This study uses a household econometric model to evaluate both the
direct and indirect impacts of the pastoralists’ decision to vaccinate
(or not to vaccinate) cattle against ECF. Adoption of ECF vaccina-
tion by pastoralists benefits household welfare through four primary
direct effects: (i) prevention of ECF-associated cattle deaths, which
occur predominantly in the first year of life and represent an asset
loss; (ii) prevention of ECF-associated decreases in milk production;
(iii) reduction in expenditures for antibiotics needed to treat ECF in-
fections; and (iv) reduction in expenditures for chemical acaricides
that are used to limit tick infestations. The economic model provides
a framework for estimating the indirect effects of ECF vaccination on
household expenditures directed toward relevant SDG goals, such as
food, health, and education.
The net benefit of ECF vaccination is 3580 Ksh for the average
household of 15 people with a mean herd size of 66 mature cattle
[the sum of avoided death loss, milk loss, and antibiotic and acar-
icide treatments less the cost of vaccination (650 Ksh per head)].
Relative to SDG goals, the largest impact of ECF vaccination is
on educational expenditures: an average increase of 3895 Ksh over
a 4-month period, or 406 Ksh per vaccination. The top 5% of
households increased their education expenditures by 5.4% for each
10% increase in proportion of cattle that were vaccinated. Education
is the single largest expense across households with a high propensity
to change, and it has a significant impact on the likelihood of male
and female children attending school. There were also significant
household expenditures on food (excluding milk) of 151 Ksh per
week (2420 KSh per 4 months). Results suggest that on-farm income,
which indirectly reflects the impact of ECF vaccination, and off-farm
income are an important basis for funding education and food,
whereas off-farm income is an important basis for health care expend-
itures. Differences in the liquidity of these sources of income may be
a reason for their distinct roles. Education expenditures are more eas-
ily planned for, because they tend to come regularly at the beginning
of school terms, whereas many health care expenditures are less easily
planned for and may come as emergencies. In the bigger picture, the
empirical evidence supports the idea that economic growth and hu-
man capital accumulation reinforce one another (14). Education leads
to growth, and growth, in turn, raises the demand for education. Con-
sequently, policies or interventions that increase household wealth will
also lead families to further educate their children, thereby increasing
wealth in the succeeding generation (14).
Given our findings that vaccinating cattle for ECF increases eco-
nomic wealth for pastoralist households and that this economic wealth
translates into additional expenditures on education and food,
understanding the determinants of household adoption is important
for maximizing benefits at a community and regional level. Consistent
themes are evident across the decisions to adopt the ECF vaccine. The
likelihood of vaccine adoption and the number of cattle vaccinated per
household are both positively influenced by the number of cattle

 owned by the household, the fraction of crossbred cattle in the herd,
and the household’s expected milk loss from ECF infection. The latter
two determinants are strongly interrelated because crossbred cattle,
incorporating European genetic determinants, produce more milk than
indigenous breeds but are also more susceptible to severe disease, re-
sulting in cessation of milk production and/or death. This indicates
that pastoralists who have a higher investment in their herds, both
in number and in adding higher productivity traits, are the most likely
to vaccinate. In effect, they are mitigating asset and income risk with
vaccination. Our data do not identify when vaccination was intro-
duced relative to expansion of herd size and breed improvement. How-
ever, prevention of death losses, especially in European breeds and
European/indigenous crossbred animals, would likely promote both
expansion and geneticimprovement. Notably, the likelihoodof vaccine
adoption and the number of cattle vaccinated per household are higher
when health information is reportedly received primarily from other
pastoralists. This is consistent with technology adoption studies in
agricultural development (15) and, more recently, with the impact of
social networks and media on individual vaccination decisions and
parental decisions to vaccinate children (16–18). In contrast, the like-
lihood of vaccine adoption is negatively correlated to information and
services from animal health professionals and/or local commercial
providers of veterinary products. This may reflect a specific dis-
incentive for product providers to recommend vaccination if they re-
cognize the potential impact of vaccinations on antibiotic and
acaricide sales.
The current ECF vaccine is far from ideal: It requires a continuous
cold chain, it is expensive relative to other livestock vaccines, and, as a
live vaccine, it can itself induce severe disease, requiring post-vaccination
antibiotic use (8). These characteristics may be a disincentive for both
commercial providers (because of the requirement for cold storage)
and pastoralists (because of cost and availability). Consequently, de-
velopment of an improved ECF vaccine may markedly amplify the
direct and indirect impacts observed with the current vaccine.
The reduction in the use of both antibiotics and acaricides follow-
ing adoption of vaccination suggests broader societal benefits beyond
household welfare. Development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a
global concern, and the use of antibiotics in livestock contributes to
the emergence and maintenance of resistant bacteria, reducing the
effectiveness of antibiotics for both human and animal diseases (19).
Similarly, intensive use of chemical acaricides that include compounds
toxic to humans in the absence of strict regulation results in environ-
mental contamination and increased concentration in water sources
during dry seasons. The reduced use of antibiotics and acaricides
when ECF vaccination is adopted supports the need for increased
adoption of existing livestock vaccines and development of new ones,
including an improved ECF vaccine.
This study highlights the centrality of household decisions in
understanding the key determinants of technology adoption and in
tracking how economic gains from adoption are directed toward
broader goals. In the absence of a household-centered approach,
which, by definition, reflects familial priorities and decision-making,
livestock vaccination and childhood education may be viewed as being
unrelated. However, by integrating household priorities for both in-
come generation and expenditure, the connection becomes evident.
It is an important step in addressing the imperfect ability to assess
the impacts of animal disease control (20). Understanding these link-
ages allows integrated efforts across disciplines to effectively form pol-
icy and achieve ambitious targets, such as the United Nation’s SDGs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We summarized the economic theory, data, and econometric strate-
gies that were used in this analysis. Additional details are provided as
Supplementary Materials.
Economic model of household production and consumption
Agricultural household models are widely used in microeconomic re-
search on development (21–23) and provide guidance for modeling
ECF vaccine adoption decisions and estimating the impact on house-
hold economic outcomes. These models characterize household pro-
duction relationships and decisions, consumption opportunities and
preferences that together drive consumption decisions, and decisions
at the interface between production and consumption. The value of
household production includes both the explicit value of goods that
are produced and sold on the market and the implicit value of goods
that are produced and consumed within the same household. Like-
wise, household consumption “expenditures” include the value of
both purchased and self-produced goods that are consumed, because
in-home consumption entails forgoing income from market sales (22).
By allocating time and resources to household production and con-
sumption of the goods that it produces, the household implicitly buys
time and goods at their opportunity cost (the market wage) from itself.
Households act as if they maximize their income (including both
market and in-home production value) and then choose their con-
sumption decisions on the basis of this income. If a production input
or technology sufficiently increases profitability of the household pro-
duction enterprise, then it will tend to be adopted, likely with ancillary
production adjustments. Consequently, household income will rise
with profitability, which allows increased expenditures on basic goods,
such as food, durable goods, and investments in human capital, such
as schooling and health.
The structure of the household economic model provides a theo-
retical foundation for econometric regression estimation and hypoth-
esis testing. In particular, it provides a foundation for specifying and
testing the following: (i) input decisions, such as ECF vaccine adoption
and antibioticuse, as a function of household characteristics; (ii)house-
hold productivity as a function of management decisions and current
asset structure; and (iii) effects of assets, income, and management on
household consumption and investment expenditures.
Household survey and data
The survey questionnaire that was used for data collection targeted
variables that were hypothesized to represent the most important
and quantitatively accessible determinants of ECF vaccination
decisions, ECF-related livestock health, and productivity outcomes,
and important household consumption categories that may change
because of the economic impacts of vaccination. The survey instru-
ment was designed, piloted, and fielded according to standard statis-
tical and econometric approaches (24). Informed consent by each
household was obtained after the nature and consequences of the
study were explained. A two-stage sample design was followed, first
selecting clusters and then households, with selected groups of house-
holds more intensively sampled than others to facilitate analysis (24).
Survey responses were voluntary. Local enumerators first received
training and then were supervised over the course of the survey.
The sample was constructed to be representative of the region
with sufficient heterogeneity in household, livestock, and geography to
provide variation in important livestock management practices and
outcomes vis-à-vis ECF. For the analysis, households were categorized

Transmara (7.0%); and District 4, all other (northernmost) districts
(6.0%). District 4 is nearer Nairobi, with more intensive management
for milk production and less pasture exposure (and hence less expo-
sure to ticks). District 3 is in southwestern Kenya, which is more rural
and remote. ECF vaccination is used in only about 40% of herds in our
sample and sparse across herds and almost always incomplete within
herds. For example, on average, only 16% of the adult cattle were re-
ported to be vaccinated.
Econometric estimation
Econometric estimation of adoption decisions, productivity outcomes,
and household expenditure effects is pursued through regression anal-
ysis, the details of which are determined jointly by the structure of
available data and supporting economic theory. Model estimation
is complicated by two factors: regressor endogeneity and limited-
distribution–dependent variables. Endogeneity of regressors can lead
to biased and inconsistent estimated effects if not accounted for (25).
We accounted for endogeneity using standard two-stage estimation
methods as described in the Supplementary Materials. In addition,
many of our dependent variables (regressands) took the form of non-
normal conditional distributions or contained count data. We used var-
iable transformations, limited dependent variable regressions, and
count regression models as described in the Supplementary Materials.
