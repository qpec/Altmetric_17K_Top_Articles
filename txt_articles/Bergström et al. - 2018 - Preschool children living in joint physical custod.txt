ABSTRACT
Aim: Joint physical custody (JPC), where children spend about equal time in both parent’s
homes after parental separation, is increasing. The suitability of this practice for preschool
children, with a need for predictability and continuity, has been questioned.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we used data on 3656 Swedish children aged three
to five years living in intact families, JPC, mostly with one parent or single care. Linear
regression analyses were conducted with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire,
completed by parents and preschool teachers, as the outcome measure.
Results: Children in JPC showed less psychological problems than those living mostly
(adjusted B 1.81; 95% CI [0.66 to 2.95]) or only with one parent (adjusted B 1.94; 95%
CI [0.75 to 3.13]), in parental reports. In preschool teacher reports, the adjusted Betas were
1.27, 95% CI [0.14 to 2.40] and 1.41, 95% CI [0.24 to 2.58], respectively. In parental
reports, children in JPC and those in intact families had similar outcomes, while teachers
reported lower unadjusted symptom scores for children in intact families.
Conclusion: Joint physical custody arrangements were not associated with more
psychological symptoms in children aged 3–5, but longitudinal studies are needed to
account for potential preseparation differences.
BACKGROUND
Shared parenting, or joint physical custody (JPC), refers to
a practice where children with noncohabiting parents live
alternatively and about equally with both parents, for
example, one week with one parent and the next week
with the other parent (1). This practice is increasing
among divorcing and separating parents throughout the
Western world, for example in Australia, Belgium and the
USA (2).
International comparisons have shown that the practice
of JPC is particularly common in Sweden, followed by
Norway and Denmark (3–5), with data showing that
around 10% of all Swedish school children live in JPC
arrangements (3–6). The numbers are lower for preschool
children, who are up to six years of age in Sweden, mostly
because a higher percentage of parents are still married or
cohabiting. Yet the large majority of preschool children
with separated or divorced parents live with both parents,
either in an equal (27%) or unequal (60%) arrangement (3).
This tendency to share parenting when parents split up and
live apart may be the result of the long-term policy
commitment to involve fathers in Nordic family policies
(3). In Sweden, for example, fathers are encouraged to take
parental leave in early parenthood, and three of the 13
publicly financed months of leave are devoted to each
parent, and they can decide how to share the other seven
between them (7).
It is well known that the health and well-being of
children are at risk when parents split up (8). The higher
risks of emotional problems and social maladjustment for
children with separated parents, compared to those with
cohabiting parents, may be related to children’s loss of
social, economic and human capital after a divorce (9).
Also, preseparation characteristics, such as lower parental
relationship satisfaction and higher conflict levels, may

 contribute to explaining the lower well-being in these
children (9).
However, a growing body of research has shown that
children’s well-being after divorce is related to how children
live and keep in contact with their parents after the
separation (10). Living alternately with both parents after
a family separation increases the likelihood of children
receiving support from their fathers, which in turn has a
positive impact on children’s well-being (10). As in a review
by Nielsen (11), many studies have, in fact, shown that
school-aged children and adolescents living in JPC settings
fare better with regard to a number of outcomes compared
with those in single care arrangements. These include a
review. However, there are also studies that have reported
no differences between children in JPC and single care
settings (12). Socioeconomic factors, levels of conflict
between parents, the quality of parent–child relationships
and children’s personalities are important factors that
contribute to, but cannot fully explain, the relation between
different living arrangements and children’s well-being
(11,12).
Despite the intense debate on the suitability of JPC for
children of preschool age, research on this age group is
scarce (13–15). Theoretically, the concerns about this
practice derive from attachment theory. According to this
theory, young children need stability and predictability in
their relationships with carers since their first attachment
relationships are still developing (16). In particular, the
assumed risks of separation from the mother, who is often
regarded as the primary attachment figure, have fuelled the
debate (13–15). However, in contrast to the research on
older children, only a handful of studies have investigated
the situation with regard to JPC for infants and preschool
children. Moreover, due to the scarcity of children in equal
JPC in existing studies, overnight stays with the second
parent, rather than equal JPC, have been the focus of
investigations. Also, the quality of some of these studies has
been questioned, and the interpretations of the results have
been intensely debated (13–15). However, these studies
have had a number of limitations, including the predomi-
nant use of maternal reports of children’s health and well-
being (17,18) and the use of nonvalidated outcomes, such as
illness in wheezing to indicate stress in children (17).
Another study had limited generalisability because half of
the fathers and 10% of the mothers were in prison during
the children’s first five years (18).
We only found three studies with validated outcome
measures for children who were three to five years of age
(17–19), and these were conducted in the US and Australia.
Pruett et al. (19) collected data on psychological problems
from both parents of children aged two to six years, and
these were measured with the Child Behaviour Checklist
(20). Their study comprised 58 children who stayed over-
night with one parent more than once a week, 41 children
with just one overnight stay per week and 33 children with
no overnight stays. They found that overnight stays by the
girls were associated with advantages in social functioning
and less psychological problems in terms of internalising
problems and aggression when compared to girls with no
overnight stays. McIntosh et al. (17) found lower persis-
tence among the two- to three-year-olds who spent 35% or
more time with their second parent, mostly the father.
However, when the same study looked at 1215 children
aged four to five years old in different contact arrangements,
they
found
no
differences
in
psychological
problems
according to the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire
and after controlling for socioeconomic family factors (21).
Tornello et al. (18) found higher proportions of insecure
attachment among infants with overnight stays but no
relation between psychological problems at the age of three
years and custody arrangements in families with a strained
social and economic situation, using the Child Behaviour
Checklist (20). However, less problems were reported
among five-year-old children who had JPC arrangements
at the age of three compared to those who only lived with
one parent at three years of age.
In conclusion, existing studies on preschool children in
equal JCP are scarce (17–19). As a consequence of the lack
of unequivocal empirical evidence, policies and recommen-
dations regarding preschool children’s living arrangements
have relied mainly on clinical observations and interpreta-
tions of developmental psychology and, in particular,
attachment theory (16).
The aim of this study was to compare psychological
symptoms, reported by parents and preschool teachers,
between groups of children aged three to five years of age.
These were based on four patterns of living arrangements:
intact families, JPC, living mostly with one parent and living
exclusively with one parent.
METHODS
Data source
Data were obtained from the Swedish population-based
Children and Parents in Focus study, which aimed to
evaluate parenting programmes offered to parents of pre-
school children in Uppsala. Details of this study have
previously been published (22). As part of the yearly health
check-up
at
Swedish
child
health
centres,
the
legal
guardians of all children aged three to five, most frequently
the mother and father, were invited to fill out one
questionnaire each regarding the child’s behaviours and
symptoms as well as questions on sociodemographic back-
ground. In addition, another questionnaire was sent to the
parents to give to their child’s preschool teacher. For this
study, we used data from children with complete data on
variables of interest from at least one parent and also from
the preschool teacher. If there was information available
from both parents, a parent questionnaire was chosen at
random. The analytical sample comprised 3656 children
aged three to five years old. All participants gave their
informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study. The
study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board
in Uppsala (dn 2012/437), and thus, all procedures con-
tributing to this work complied with the original Declara-
tion of Helsinki and its later amendments.

Living arrangements and mental health in preschoolers
 Variables
The parents were asked to report on the child’s residence or
living arrangements, by checking one of the seven options:
with both parents, alternating between parents about equally,
alternating between parents but mostly with me, alternating
between parents and mostly with the other parent, only with
me, only with the other parent or another option that they
were asked to describe. For the purpose of this study, we used
four groups: original family (living with both parents), JPC
(alternating between parents, about equally), mostly with one
(alternating between parents, mostly with me/alternating
between parents, mostly with the other parent) and only with
one (only with me/only with the other parent). We excluded
eight children who were not living with either parent as they
were living with grandparents or were in foster care.
The other child variables that we used were the child’s
gender (girl or boy) and age (three, four or five). The other
family variables used in the study were the responding
parent’s gender (female, male), age (continuous), educa-
tional level (less than high school, high school or univer-
sity), country of birth (Sweden or other) and relationship
status (married/cohabiting, single or other).
The
survey
included
the
Swedish
version
of
the
Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) (21,23),
which is designed to be completed by parents or teachers.
The SDQ is a widely used screening tool for child
emotional and behavioural problems. The four symptom
subscales measure emotional symptoms, conduct prob-
lems, hyperactivity/inattention and peer relationship prob-
lems. Each item is scored on a three-point scale from zero
to two. The main outcome measure in this study was the
total sum of the scores from the four symptom subscales
(the SDQ Total Difficulties), with a range from zero to 40.
One score was calculated for parental reports and one for
teacher reports.
Statistical analyses
Sociodemographic characteristics are presented as means
and standard deviations or as numbers and percentages.
Mean values and standard deviations were calculated for
the total scores for the teacher and parental reports of the
SDQ, respectively. Pearson correlations were computed to
examine the relations between parental and teacher reports
of the SDQ for each of the four custody groups. Multiple
linear regressions were used to analyse the relations
between the child’s living arrangement, namely intact
family, JPC, mostly with one parent and only with one
parent, and the teacher and parent total SDQ scores,
respectively. The analyses were carried out in two steps. The
first model was only adjusted for the child’s gender, child’s
age and parent’s gender, and the second model was also
adjusted for the parental characteristics, including educa-
tion, country of birth and age as a continuous variable.
RESULTS
Background characteristics
Of the 3656 children, 136 (3.7%) were living in a JPC
arrangement, 3369 (92.1%) in intact families, 79 (2.2%)
mostly with one parent and 72 children (2.0%) only with
one parent. As shown in Table 1, parents with JPC were
more likely to be born in Sweden than parents in families
where the children lived mostly with one parent or only
with one parent after the separation. Boys and girls were

 more evenly distributed in intact families than in separated
families.
Psychological symptoms in relation to background
characteristics
The preschool teachers consistently rated children’s psy-
chological
problems
as
less
severe
than
the
parents
(Table 2). According to both parents and teachers, boys
were rated as having more psychological problems than
girls, as were younger children, the children of younger
parents and of parents with lower educational levels,
children with single parents and those with parents born
outside
Sweden.
Correlations
between
parental
and
teacher reports, based on the SDQ Total Difficulties and
divided by each custody group, were as follows: intact
family 0.32 (p < 0.001), JPC 0.27 (p = 0.002), mostly with
one parent 0.47 (p < 0.001) and only with one parent
0.34 (p = 0.002). These correlations were not significantly
different, except for the correlations between JPC (0.27)
and mostly with one parent (0.47; z = 1.65; one-tailed
p = 0.049).
Parents and teachers rated children who lived mostly or
only with one parent as having more psychological prob-
lems than those in JPC arrangements, even after controlling
for socioeconomic factors (Tables 3 and 4). Children in
intact families had the same levels of psychological symp-
toms as those living in JPC settings, according to the
parents. According to the preschool teachers, children
living in JPC settings suffered from more psychological
symptoms than those in intact families. However, this
difference did not remain statistically significant after
controlling for parental factors in the second model
(Table 4).
DISCUSSION
In this cross-sectional study of 3656 preschool children
aged three to five, parental and preschool teacher reports
showed that children living in JPC settings suffered from
less psychological problems, as measured by the SDQ, than
those living mostly or only with one parent, before and after
adjusting for sociodemographic variables. Parents reported

Living arrangements and mental health in preschoolers
 similar results for children in intact families and children in
JPC, while teachers reported somewhat higher unadjusted
levels that were slightly attenuated by adjustment for
sociodemographic confounders.
Including assessments from preschool teachers as well as
the nuanced categorisation of children’s living arrange-
ments and the inclusion of a relatively large group of
children living in about equal JPC in this study adds to the
previously scare scientific understanding of psychological
symptoms in preschool children in different living arrange-
ments (17–19). Furthermore, the results were in accordance
with studies on JPC in school-aged children, where children
living in JPC settings reported better health outcomes than
those living mostly or only with one parent (6,24,25).
The similarity in the pattern of psychological symptoms
in relation to living arrangements among preschool children
to that among older children and adolescents is interesting
as JPC has been particularly questioned for young children.
An important reason for favouring single care residence for
young children in the debate has been their assumed need
of stability and predictability in their parental relationships
(13,14,16). The results of this study indicate that JPC
arrangements were per se not associated with more psy-
chological symptoms in children. There might be several
reasons for this. Possibly, the child’s access to two involved
parents may instead be more important for children’s
psychological well-being than the problems associated with
moving between homes. Having an involved father has
been
shown,
in
numerous
studies,
to
be
especially
important for children’s mental health and development
(10,26). In addition, both parents might experience less
parenting stress by being able to better balance work and
parenting duties and recuperate, due to being child-free
every other week (27). Less stress along with more desig-
nated child time could lead to better parenting practices
and more engagement in activities with the child, promot-
ing the child’s development and well-being.
However, it is also possible that parents who agreed on,
and were able to manage, JPC had less conflict or were
more involved parents prior to the separation and therefore
provided a better environment for their child’s mental
health development. Our cross-sectional study design had
limited possibilities to control for such factors. We adjusted
for parental educational level and country of origin, but did
not have access to factors such as the parents’ conflict level
or ability to coparent. On the whole, we believe that the
lack of increased psychological symptoms among preschool
children living in JPC settings most likely had to do with the
compensatory functions of involved parenting, whereas
children living mostly with one parent, or only with one
parent, may have had less access to this protective factor
and may also had been more exposed to predivorce risk
factors with higher levels of toxic stress.
Strengths and limitations
One strength of this study was how we categorised
postseparation living arrangements. Previous studies have
mainly focused on overnight stays or included children

 living with one parent for up to 30% of the time (17–19). In
this study, JPC was defined as children spending about an
equal amount of time living with both parents. Furthermore,
the inclusion of the living mostly with one parent category
implies that children of parents who chose the JPC category
actually spent about 50% of their time in each parent’s
home. A further, and particular, strength was the parallel
parental and teacher reports on the child’s behaviour. Many
studies on this age group mainly rely on maternal reports
and the inclusion of paternal reports, and in particular
those of preschool teachers, possibly provided more objec-
tive reports on child mental health (17–19). Furthermore,
our sample size was relatively large compared to earlier
studies on this topic.
The main limitation of this study was its cross-sectional
design.
Although
we
adjusted
the
analysis
for
some
sociodemographic confounders, it seems probable that
substantial residual confounding existed with regard to
other familial risk factors. It also seems likely that there was
a positive selection of parents into the JPC category, with
regard to communication between the separated parents,
and a negative selection into the living mostly or only with
one parent, with regard to parents who had a range of social
problems. Another limitation was the possible selection bias
of fathers who choose to complete the outcome measure in
the current study. A study by Bastaits et al. (28) indicated
that fathers who were more involved with their children
were also more likely to participate in surveys about their
children. Fathers of children in JPC settings tend to be more
involved, so it is not surprising that, in the current study,
children in JPC settings were more likely to be represented
by their fathers compared to children living mostly or only
with one parent. We conducted all the analyses controlling
for parent’s gender, but the extent to which our results were
explained by these selection biases can only be evaluated in
longitudinal studies with information on the child’s and
parents’ mental health before and after separation. There-
fore, further studies with a longitudinal design are much
needed to inform policy and advice regarding living
arrangements for young children when parents separate.
Despite the comparatively large population-based sample
of preschool children in this study, the low rate of JPC at
this age somewhat limited the conclusions we could draw.
The limited number of children living in JPC arrangements
also prevented us from studying the subscales of the SDQ.
Both externalising and internalising problems can result
from poor child–parent relationships (29,30), and this is
why studies with larger populations of children living in JPC
settings are needed to better understand the nature of the
psychological problems experienced.
CONCLUSION
Preschool children who spent about equal time in both of
their parent’s respective homes after a separation showed
less psychological problems than those living mostly or only
with one parent. The design of the current study did not
allow us to determine whether this difference was due to

Living arrangements and mental health in preschoolers
 preseparation factors, but our results showed that JPC
arrangements were not per se associated with more psy-
chological symptoms. Longitudinal studies are needed to
further inform policy makers and families.
