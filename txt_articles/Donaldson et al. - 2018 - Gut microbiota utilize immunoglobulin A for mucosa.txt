Abstract
The immune system responds vigorously to microbial infection, while permitting life-long 
colonization by the microbiome. Mechanisms that facilitate the establishment and stability of the 
gut microbiota remain poorly described. We discovered that a sensor/regulatory system in the 
prominent human commensal Bacteroides fragilis modulates its surface architecture to invite 
binding of immunoglobulin A (IgA). Specific immune recognition facilitated bacterial adherence 
to cultured intestinal epithelial cells and intimate association with the gut mucosal surface in vivo. 
The IgA response was required for B. fragilis, and other commensal species, to occupy a defined 
mucosal niche that mediated stable colonization of the gut through exclusion of exogenous 
competitors. Therefore, in addition to its role in pathogen clearance, we propose that IgA 
responses can be co-opted by the microbiome to engender robust host-microbial symbiosis.
Main Text
At birth, ecological and evolutionary processes commence to assemble a complex microbial 
consortium in the animal gut. Community composition of the adult human gut microbiome 
is remarkably stable during health, despite day-to-day variability in diet and diverse 
environmental exposures. Instability, or dysbiosis, may be involved in the etiology of a 
variety of immune, metabolic, and neurologic diseases (1, 2). Longitudinal sequencing 
studies indicate a majority of bacterial strains persist within an individual for years (3), and 
for most species there is a single, persistently dominant strain (4) (termed “single-strain 
stability”). Mucus and components of the innate and adaptive immune systems are thought 
to influence microbiome stability, independently of diet. For example, immunoglobulin A

 (IgA), the main antibody isotype secreted in the gut, shapes the composition of the intestinal 
microbiome via currently unknown mechanisms (5–8). IgA deficiency in mice increases 
inter-individual variability in the microbiome (9) and decreases diversity (10, 11). The direct 
effects of IgA on bacteria have largely been studied in the context of enteric infection by 
pathogens (12). However, early studies of IgA in the healthy gut found that the majority of 
live bacterial cells in feces are bound by IgA (13), reflecting a steady-state IgA response to 
persistent indigenous microbes (14). Studies show that IgA promotes adherence of 
commensal bacteria to tissue-cultured intestinal epithelial cells (15, 16), though the in vivo 
implications of this observation are unclear. Furthermore, lack of IgA, the most common 
human immunodeficiency, does not affect lifespan and only modestly increases 
susceptibility to respiratory and gastrointestinal infections (17), raising the question of why 
the immune system evolved to invest the considerable energy to produce several grams of 
IgA daily (18).
Bacteroides fragilis is an important member of the human gut microbiome, with beneficial 
properties that ameliorate inflammatory and behavioral symptoms in preclinical animal 
models (19–22). This commensal exhibits remarkable single-strain stability (23, 24) and 
enriched colonization of the gut mucosal surface (25). To explore physical features of B. 
fragilis interaction with the host epithelium, we used transmission electron microscopy 
(TEM) to visualize colonic tissues of mono-colonized mice. B. fragilis commonly formed 
discrete aggregates of tightly-packed cells on the apical epithelial surface (Fig. 1A) and 
penetrated the glycocalyx layer of transmembrane mucins, nearly contacting the microvilli 
(Fig. 1B and fig. S1A and B). Intact B. fragilis cells were also found nestled in the ducts of 
the crypts of Lieberkühn (Fig. 1C and S1C). We previously identified a genetic locus in B. 
fragilis, named the commensal colonization factors (ccfABCDE), which is necessary for 
colonization of colonic crypts (26). To assess how these genes affect bacterial localization to 
the mucosal surface, we mono-colonized mice with a ccfCDE (Δccf) mutant. By TEM, B. 
fragilis Δccf was only found as sparse, individual cells within the epithelial mucosa, 
excluded from contact with the glycocalyx (Fig. 1D and E), and never observed in 
aggregates as for wild-type bacteria (Fig. 1F). B. fragilis burden in the colon lumen was 
identical between strains (fig. S2A), suggesting that the CCF system is required specifically 
for bacterial aggregation within mucus.
High-resolution tomograms of bacterial cells in vivo revealed the presence of a thick, fuzzy 
capsule layer covering wild-type B. fragilis (Fig. 1G), which was significantly reduced in B. 
fragilis Δccf (Fig. 1H and 1I). We sought to investigate the bacterial physiology underlying 
this ultrastructural change, and potential corresponding effects on colonization. The ccf 
locus is highly induced during gut colonization (26) and bacterial growth in mucin O-
glycans (27), indicating the CCF system may sense a specific host-derived glycan. The ccf 
genes are homologous to polysaccharide utilization systems in which a sigma factor (ccfA) 
is activated by extracellular glycan sensing (28), thus we hypothesized that ccfA may 
activate genes involved in mucosal colonization. We overexpressed ccfA in B. fragilis and 
assessed global gene expression by RNAseq during in vitro growth (without overexpression 
ccf is poorly expressed in culture (26)). Of the non-ccf genes regulated by ccfA, 24 out of 25 
genes mapped to the biosynthesis loci for capsular polysaccharides A and C (PSA and PSC) 
(Fig. 2A, 2B and Table S1). Correspondingly, ccf mutation decreased expression of PSC and

 increased expression of PSA in vivo (Fig. 2C). While phase variation of capsular 
polysaccharides is known to influence general in vivo fitness of B. fragilis (29, 30), these 
studies identify a pathway for transcriptional regulation of specific polysaccharides in the 
context of mucosal colonization.
We modeled single-strain stability using a horizontal transmission assay, wherein co-housing 
animals respectively harboring isogenic strains of wild-type B. fragilis resulted in minimal 
strain transmission from one animal to another (Fig. 2D, S2A). This intra-species 
colonization resistance is provided through bacterial occupation of a species-specific 
nutrient or spatial niche (26). However, as previously reported (26), if mice are colonized 
initially with B. fragilis Δccf, animals were permissive to co-colonization by wild-type B. 
fragilis after co-housing (Fig. 2E, S2B), indicating a CCF-dependent defect in niche 
saturation. Mice harboring a mutant in the biosynthesis genes for PSC (ΔPSC) showed 
highly variable co-colonization by wild-type bacteria (Fig. 2F, S2C). Interestingly, we 
observed an unexpected increase in expression of the PSB biosynthesis genes in this mutant 
(Fig. 2H), which may compensate for the loss of PSC. We generated a strain defective in 
synthesizing both PSB and PSC (ΔPSB/C), and mice mono-associated with the double 
mutant were consistently unable to maintain colonization resistance (Fig. 2G, S2D–F), 
though the strain retained ccf expression (fig. S2G). Despite lack of competition in a mono-
colonized setting and equal levels of colonization in the colon lumen (fig. S2H), the B. 
fragilis Δccf and ΔPSB/C strains were defective in colonization of the ascending colon 
mucus (Fig. 2I), reflecting impaired saturation of the mucosal niche. Accordingly, when we 
imaged the ΔPSB/C strain in vivo employing TEM, though the capsule was not as thin as in 
B. fragilis Δccf (fig. S2I and J), the hallmark epithelial aggregation phenotype was abrogated 
compared to wild-type bacteria (fig. S2K and L). Therefore, we conclude that the CCF 
system regulates capsule expression to mediate B. fragilis mucosal colonization and single 
strain stability.
To investigate host responses contributing to mucosal colonization, we defined the 
transcriptome of the ascending colon during colonization with wild-type B. fragilis or B. 
fragilis Δccf. Remarkably, 7 of the 14 differentially expressed genes encode immunoglobulin 
variable chains (Fig. 3A and table S2). We did not observe any elevation of immune 
responses in Δccf–colonized mice (fig. S3A), indicating that changes in mucosal association 
are not caused by inflammation. Accordingly, we tested whether capsular polysaccharide 
regulation by ccf affects IgA recognition of bacteria (31–33). In fecal samples from mono-
colonized animals, wild-type B. fragilis was highly coated with IgA, which was significantly 
diminished in Δccf and ΔPSB/C strains (Fig. 3B, 3C, and S4A). We observed no difference 
between these strains in the induction of total fecal IgA (Fig. 3D), reflecting equivalent 
stimulation of nonspecific IgA production (10, 34, 35). To test bacteria-specific responses, 
IgA extracted from feces of mice mono-colonized with B. fragilis was evaluated for binding 
to bacteria recovered from mono-colonized Rag1−/− mice (in vivo-adapted, yet IgA-free 
bacteria). Western blots of bacterial lysates showed that strong IgA reactivity to capsular 
polysaccharides was abrogated in the Δccf and ΔPSB/C strains (Fig. 3E and F). Although 
IgA can be polyreactive (10, 34, 35), binding to lysates of Bacteroides was species-specific 
(fig. S4B) and required induction of IgA following bacterial colonization (fig. S4C and D). 
Accordingly, in a whole bacteria binding assay, IgA induced by wild-type bacteria

 maximally coated wild-type B. fragilis compared with the Δccf and ΔPSB/C strains (Fig. 
3G). IgA induced by B. fragilis Δccf exhibited reduced binding to wild-type bacteria (Fig. 
3G). The addition of IgA to in vivo-adapted, IgA-free bacteria increased adherence of B. 
fragilis to intestinal epithelial cells in tissue culture (Fig. 3H), yet had no effect on bacterial 
viability (fig. S4E). Cell lines known to produce more mucus (36) exhibited a greater 
capacity for IgA-enhanced B. fragilis adherence (fig. S4F), consistent with prior work 
showing that IgA binds mucus (36–38). Importantly, IgA-enhanced adherence was 
decreased if targeted bacteria lack ccf or PSB/C, or if the IgA tested was induced by a ccf 
mutant or Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Fig. 3H and S4G). While pathogenic bacteria 
elaborate capsular polysaccharides for immune evasion, these results suggest B. fragilis 
deploys specific capsules for immune attraction, potentially enabling stable mucosal 
colonization.
We determined whether IgA coating promotes B. fragilis colonization in mice. Using the 
horizontal transmission paradigm, Rag1−/− mice colonized with wild-type B. fragilis were 
readily co-colonized by an isogenic strain from a co-housed animal (fig. S5A and B), 
showing loss of colonization resistance in the absence of adaptive immunity. We next treated 
wild-type mice with an anti-CD20 antibody (fig. S5C) (39) to deplete B cells (fig. S5D–F), 
thus reducing total fecal IgA levels (fig. S5G) and eliminating IgA coating of wild-type B. 
fragilis during mono-colonization (Fig. 4A). IgA recovered from isotype control treated 
mice, also mono-colonized with B. fragilis, promoted adherence of wild-type bacteria to 
epithelial cells in vitro, while IgA from anti-CD20 treated mice had no effect despite being 
exposed to B. fragilis antigens (Fig. 4B). In the horizontal transmission assay, B cell 
depleted mice mono-colonized with B. fragilis were readily invaded by wild-type bacteria, 
while isotype control-injected animals retained colonization resistance (Fig. 4C and S5H). 
Therefore, active B cell responses to B. fragilis colonization enhance single-strain stability.
As B cell depletion eliminates all antibody isotypes, germ-free IgA−/− mice (40) were 
generated and mono-colonized with B. fragilis. We did not observe compensatory coating by 
IgM (fig. S6A). In a horizontal transmission assay with wild-type (BALB/c) and IgA−/− 
mice, lack of IgA allowed co-colonization by challenge strains (Fig. 4D, S6B–D), indicating 
that IgA specifically contributes to single-strain stability. This feature was reproduced in 
mice with a full microbial community “spiked” with genetically marked B. fragilis strains 
(fig. S6E and F), revealing that single-strain stability of an individual bacterial species 
occurs in the context of a complex community. Mono-colonized IgA−/− mice harbored 
reduced levels of live bacteria in the colon mucus compared to wild-type mice (Fig. 4E), 
though they had greater numbers of bacteria in the colon lumen (fig. S6G). TEM images of 
ascending colon tissues reveal that in IgA−/− animals, wild-type B. fragilis failed to 
aggregate on the epithelial surface (Fig. 4F and 4G), similar to the ccf and PSB/C mutants in 
wild-type animals. B. fragilis cells also formed aggregates in feces in the presence of IgA 
(fig. S7), indicating that enhanced mucosal colonization may be due to increased 
aggregation or growth (41) within mucus. These findings converge to support a model 
whereby ccf regulates expression of specific capsular polysaccharides to attract IgA binding, 
allowing for robust mucosal colonization and single-strain stability.

 Beyond B. fragilis, we tested whether IgA shapes a complex microbiome following 
controlled introduction of mouse microbiota to germ-free BALB/c or IgA−/− mice. One 
month following colonization, despite similar microbiome profiles in feces of both mouse 
genotypes (fig. S8A), we observed differences for specific taxa (Table S3). We also 
identified a defect in community stratification between the colonic mucus and lumen of IgA
−/− mice (Fig. 4H and S8B), revealing that IgA is required to individualize microbiome 
profiles between these two anatomic locations. Remarkably, a highly mucus-enriched exact 
sequence variant (ESV), mapping uniquely to B. fragilis, was significantly decreased in the 
mucus of IgA−/− mice compared to BALB/c mice (Fig. 4I and S9A), naturally supporting 
our observations from mono-colonized mice. To extend this analysis to other microbial 
species, we identified Rikanellaceae, Blautia sp., and segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) 
as being highly IgA-coated (fig. S9B) (35), and assessed the abundance of these taxa in the 
colonic or ileal mucus. Blautia sp. and segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) displayed 
increased mucosal association in the absence of IgA (Fig. 4I) (42), demonstrating that IgA 
can protect the intestinal barrier. However, similar to B. fragilis, Rikanellaceae were highly 
abundant in colon mucus and significantly depleted in IgA−/− mice (Fig. 4I). We conclude 
that IgA-enhanced mucosal colonization occurs within complex communities for multiple 
strains of B. fragilis and other species of the gut microbiome.
Classically viewed, the immune system evolved to prevent microbial colonization. However, 
not only do animals tolerate a complex microbiome, in the case of B. fragilis provoking an 
immune response paradoxically enables intimate association with its mammalian host. 
Related commensal bacteria may also benefit from actively engaging IgA during symbiosis, 
as Rag2−/− mice devoid of adaptive immunity harbor fewer Bacteroides (43), and both B cell 
deficient and IgA−/− animals display decreased colonization by the Bacteroidaceae family 
(44). IgA has been previously shown to increase adherence of Escherichia coli (15), 
Bifidobacterium lactis, and Lactobacillus ramnosus (16) to tissue-cultured epithelial cells, 
suggesting that these microorganisms may also benefit from IgA to establish a mucosal 
bacterial community. Mucosal microbiome instability or loss of immunomodulatory species 
may underlie the link between IgA deficiency and autoimmune diseases in humans (45). 
Interestingly, while IgA-coated bacteria from individuals with IBD (46) or nutritional 
deficiencies (47) exacerbate respective pathologies in mice, IgA-coated bacteria from 
healthy humans protect mice from disease (47). We propose that during health, IgA fosters 
mucosal colonization of microbiota with beneficial properties (9), while disease states may 
induce (or be caused by) IgA responses to pathogens or pathobionts that disrupt healthy 
microbiome equilibria. Indeed, computational models indicate that IgA can both maintain 
indigenous mucosal populations and clear invasive pathogens (48). In addition to serving as 
a defense system, we discover that adaptive immunity evolved to engender intimate 
association with members of the gut microbiome.

 Fig. 1. Bacteroides fragilis resides as aggregates on the colon epithelium in a CCF-dependent 
manner
(A) Representative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) projection and (B) high-
resolution tomogram of epithelial-associated wild-type B. fragilis in mono-colonized mice. 
Ascending colons of mice harbored aggregates of B. fragilis (green arrow) under non-
pathogenic conditions, that made tight associations with the glycocalyx (yellow line) 
overlying intestinal epithelial cells (IECs, yellow arrow). (C) Tomogram of wild-type B. 
fragilis penetrating deep into the duct of a crypt of Lieberkühn. (D) Representative TEM 
projection image and (E) tomogram of epithelial-associated B. fragilis Δccf. The absence of 
the CCF system abrogated formation of bacterial aggregates and prevented intimate 
association with the glycocalyx. (n = 3 mice per group, about 1 mm epithelium scanned per 
mouse). (F) Quantification of bacterial cells per projection montage (A and D) of epithelial-
associated bacteria (unpaired t test, n = 7, 8 images from 4 mice per group). (G and H) 
Tomogram of the bacterial surface of wild-type B. fragilis (G) in comparison to B. fragilis 
Δccf (H) revealed a thick fuzzy capsule for wild-type bacteria residing in the colons of mice. 
(I) Measurement of capsule thickness (unpaired t test, n = 10 cells from 3 mice per group) 
(*** p < 0.001).

 Fig. 2. Specific capsular polysaccharides, regulated by ccf, are necessary for single-strain 
stability
(A) RNAseq gene expression analysis of B. fragilis overexpressing ccfA during laboratory 
culture growth, relative to empty vector control (n = 3). Green symbols represent PSA genes; 
red symbols represent PSC genes; blue symbols represent ccf genes. (B) Heat map of 
expression levels for all capsular polysaccharide loci in B. fragilis following ccfA 
overexpression during growth in culture. (C) Relative expression using qRT-PCR (ΔΔCt 
normalized to gyrase) of RNA from colon lumen contents of mice mono-colonized with B. 
fragilis or B. fragilis Δccf (Sidak 2-way ANOVA, n = 4). (D–G) Abundance of foreign 
strains exchanged between pairs of co-housed mice each mono-colonized with the indicated 
strains, in colony forming units (CFU) per gram of feces (Sidak repeated measure 2-way 
ANOVA on log-transformed data, geometric mean and 95% CI, n = 9–12 pairs per plot). (H) 
Relative expression levels of capsular polysaccharides analyzed by qRT-PCR (ΔΔCt 
normalized to gyrase) of RNA from colon lumen contents of mice mono-colonized with B. 
fragilis or B. fragilis ΔPSC (Sidak 2-way ANOVA, n = 3, 4). (I) Plating of CFU from 
ascending colon mucus of mice mono-colonized with B. fragilis strains (Tukey ANOVA, n = 
8) (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001).

 Fig. 3. B. fragilis induces a specific IgA response, dependent on ccf regulation of surface capsular 
polysaccharides, which enhances epithelial adherence
(A) RNAseq gene expression analysis of RNA recovered from whole ascending colon tissue 
of mice mono-colonized with B. fragilis or B. fragilis Δccf (n = 3). (B) Flow cytometry plots 
and (C) quantification of IgA coating of B. fragilis from feces of mice mono-colonized with 
various strains (Tukey ANOVA, n = 11–12). (D) ELISA for total fecal IgA in mono-
colonized mice (Sidak repeated measure 2-way ANOVA, not significant, n = 4). (E) 
Bacterial lysates from feces of mono-colonized Rag1−/− mice probed in Western blots with 
fecal IgA from B. fragilis mono-colonized mice and (F) quantification of the proportional 
signal from IgA binding to capsular polysaccharides (CPS) (over 245 kDa) (Tukey ANOVA, 
n = 3 mice). (G) Binding of fecal IgA extracted from mono-colonized mice to various strains 
of B. fragilis. Source of IgA is mice colonized with either WT B. fragilis or B. fragilis Δccf. 
Because ccf is expressed in vivo, IgA-free bacteria from feces of mono-colonized Rag1−/− 
mice were used as the target for IgA binding (Tukey 2-way ANOVA, *significantly different 
from WT bacteria with WT IgA, n = 3). (H) In vitro epithelial cell adherence assay using 
IgA extracted from Swiss Webster mice (or Rag1−/−, second column) mono-colonized with 
B. fragilis or B. thetaiotaomicron (theta; last column). IgA-free but in vivo-adapted bacteria 
were isolated from mono-colonized Rag1−/− mice (Tukey ANOVA, n = 4 mice as the source 
of bacteria) (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001).

colonized with wild-type B. fragilis (Sidak repeated measure 2-way ANOVA on log-
transformed data, n = 9). (E) CFU plating of ascending colon mucus of wild-type and IgA−/− 
mice mono-colonized with wild-type B. fragilis (unpaired t test, n = 9). (F) Representative 
TEM projections of ascending colon (yellow arrow: epithelial cell) from mice mono-
colonized with wild-type B. fragilis (green arrow) (n = 3 mice per group, about 1 mm 
epithelium scanned per mouse) and (G) quantification of bacterial cells per projection 
montage (unpaired t test, n = 7, 6 images from 3 mice per group) (H) Principle coordinate 
analyses of weighed UniFrac distances of 16S community profiles of ex-germ-free BALB/c 
and BALB/c IgA−/− mice transplanted with a complex mouse microbiota (Adonis test within 
colon for lumen/mucus difference). (I) Relative abundance of B. fragilis and highly IgA-
coated ESVs in ex-germ-free mice (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001).
