Abstract
More than 60 years ago, the effect whereby radiotherapy at one site may lead to regression of 
metastatic cancer at distant sites that are not irradiated was described and called the abscopal effect 
(from ‘ab scopus’, that is, away from the target). The abscopal effect has been connected to 
mechanisms involving the immune system. However, the effect is rare because at the time of 
treatment, established immune-tolerance mechanisms may hamper the development of sufficiently 
robust abscopal responses. Today, the growing consensus is that combining radiotherapy with 
immunotherapy provides an opportunity to boost abscopal response rates, extending the use of 
radiotherapy to treatment of both local and metastatic disease. In this Opinion article, we review 
evidence for this growing consensus and highlight emerging limitations to boosting the abscopal 
effect using immunotherapy. This is followed by a perspective on current and potential cross-
disciplinary approaches, including the use of smart materials to address these limitations.
Radiotherapy is a crucial part of the cancer treatment armamentarium1. However, 
radiotherapy is limited by normal tissue toxicity, and it is generally prescribed for treatment 
of localized tumours. Recent technological advances have focused on addressing the toxicity 
limitation, with advanced radiotherapy modalities aimed at achieving greater therapeutic 
effectiveness (that is, greater tumour cell killing with less normal tissue toxicity and less 
time under treatment compared with previous approaches)2,3. These advanced radiotherapy 
technologies and approaches include intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), image-

 guided radiotherapy (IGRT), high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy, stereotactic ablative body 
radiotherapy (SABR), proton therapy and carbon ion radiotherapy.
For example, IMRT allows the creation and delivery of precise radiation doses that conform 
to the target tumour while minimizing the dose delivered to neighbouring healthy tissues2. 
The increase in conformality and tighter treatment margins engendered an increased need for 
accuracy to circumvent the potential to miss the tumour owing to organ motion and/or 
variability in patient setup. IGRT works to assuage this need by allowing imaging of the 
target immediately before or even during treatment to guide a more geographically precise 
delivery of the dose2. Improved accuracy and greater understanding of radiation biology 
have in turn made dose escalation feasible, and this has allowed for further improvement in 
the therapeutic ratio for several tumour sites. The advent of SABR is partly a consequence of 
this, allowing for hypofractionated treatment with precise delivery of very high radiotherapy 
doses with short overall treatment times. Other advanced radiotherapy approaches employ 
high-energy protons or carbon ion beams. The main advantage of therapy with such charged 
particle beams is the ability to more precisely localize the radiation dosage4. Intra-operative 
radiotherapy is another advanced modality where a concentrated dose of radiotherapy is 
administered to a tumour bed during surgery to kill any residual cancer cells after the tumour 
has been removed4. In addition to advanced external beam radiotherapy modalities, HDR 
brachytherapy has been developed to allow short-distance radiotherapy of cancers, including 
skin, cervical, prostate and breast cancers, with minimal toxicities to healthy tissue. With 
these remarkable developments, radiotherapy can currently provide benefit in the treatment 
of over 50% of patients with cancer when used alone or in combination with other 
treatments such as surgery (for example, intra-operative radiotherapy) or chemotherapy 
(chemoradiotherapy)1.
While advances in radiotherapy technologies have largely focused on minimizing toxicity 
and improving the therapeutic ratio when treating localized tumours, there have also been 
recent developments relevant to the abscopal effect that provide a promising frontier in 
extending the use of radiotherapy to treatment of both localized and metastatic disease. The 
term ‘abscopal’ was first introduced in 1953 by Mole5,6 to describe an immune-mediated 
response to radiation by tumour cells located distant from the irradiated site5–8. Over the 
years, the rare abscopal effect has been reported for several cancers, including melanoma9, 
renal cell carcinoma10, breast cancer7, hepatocellular carcinoma11 and other metastatic solid 
tumours12. A recent review estimates that there have been 46 case reports of the abscopal 
effect from radiotherapy alone between 1969 and 2014 (REF. 13). There is now a growing 
consensus from many studies indicating that combining radiotherapy with immunotherapy 
provides an opportunity to boost abscopal response rates. This Opinion article examines the 
growing evidence behind this consensus and discusses some of the emerging limitations, as 
many institutions worldwide are increasingly testing this combination strategy. This is 
followed by a perspective on current and potential cross-disciplinary approaches, including 
the use of smart biomaterials to address these limitations and extend this benefit to more 
patients.

 Boosting the abscopal effect
Following the first description of the abscopal effect5, initial case reports were recorded for 
melanoma and papillary adenocarcinoma when using radiotherapy alone in 1973–1975 
(REFS 14,15) (FIG. 1). In 1979, it was shown that cell killing by ionizing radiation contains 
an immune-mediated component, with the degree of integrity of the host immune system 
determining the radiosensitivity of a tumour16. In a syngeneic mouse model of fibrosarcoma, 
the radiotherapy dose required to control tumour growth was determined in mice that were T 
cell competent compared with those that were T cell depleted. It was found that the average 
radiation dose required to control tumour growth in 50% of the mice was lower for the T 
cell-competent mice than for the T cell-deficient mice. In addition, the likelihood of 
developing metastasis in T cell-deficient mice was increased, demonstrating an association 
between immune status, local response to radiotherapy and metastasis.
Since then, several studies have demonstrated that there is a direct connection between the 
abscopal effect and mechanisms involving the immune system17–19. For example, in a 
bilateral syngeneic mouse model of breast cancer, treatment with a combination of 
radiotherapy on one flank and systemic delivery of the immunoadjuvant FMS-like tyrosine 
kinase receptor 3 ligand (FLT3L) led to a significant growth delay of the irradiated tumour 
as well as the non-irradiated tumour compared with untreated control mice. This abscopal 
effect was dependent on the presence of T cells17, suggesting that radiotherapy can increase 
the immunogenicity of a tumour and hence can be used to improve immunotherapy 
effectiveness or vice versa. Regarding the latter, results indicating that the use of 
immunotherapy could help in boosting the abscopal effect during radiotherapy were reported 
by a number of preclinical studies20–25 (TABLE 1). These studies also examined different 
schedules for fractionation and dosing as well as different combinations of radiotherapy and 
immunotherapy.
In a clinical trial that tested radiotherapy in combination with an immunoadjuvant, 
granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), for the treatment of multiple 
types of confirmed solid metastatic cancer, an abscopal response occurred in approximately 
30% of patients12. In a different study on melanoma, radiotherapy in combination with an 
immunotherapy comprising antibodies against cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 
(CTLA4) and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PDL1) increased abscopal response 
rates26. Currently, many ongoing studies are investigating the combination of radiotherapy 
and immunotherapy to improve treatment outcomes for different indications27.
Abscopal response mechanism
Although the biological mechanism underlying the abscopal effect is yet to be fully 
understood, several studies have helped to elucidate how combining radiotherapy with 
immunotherapy would boost this effect. When a tumour is irradiated, the cellular stress or 
injury in the tumours may lead to the liberation of neoantigens, here referred to as tumour-
associated antigens (TAAs), in the context of necrotic and apoptotic tumour cells and debris. 
A substantial increase in the number and diversity of TAAs can stimulate a tumour-specific 
immune response, with TAAs engulfed by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and then 
presented to CD8+ T cells. The CD8+ T cells can then recognize and attack both the primary

 tumour and metastatic disease28 (FIG. 2). Irradiated tumour cells may also release cellular 
danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and cytokines that enhance traffic of 
immune cells29. Collectively, these events promote tumour cell elimination by primed CD8+ 
T cells30,31.
The rarity of the abscopal effect suggests that even primed antitumour CD8+ T cells are 
unable to overcome the suppressive effect of the tumour microenvironment29,30. 
Immunosuppressive cytokines released by tumours, such as transforming growth factor-β 
(TGFβ), and surface receptors expressed on T cells, such as CTLA4, can inhibit the function 
of T cells. M2 macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and immature 
dendritic cells (DCs) may also suppress T cell functions29,30. Tumour elimination could be 
further inhibited by CD4+ T cells with regulatory function (also called regulatory T (Treg) 
cells).
For a range of tumour types, preclinical studies (TABLE 1) consistently show that 
combining radiotherapy with immunotherapy substantially improves abscopal response rates 
compared with using radiotherapy or immunotherapy alone. From these studies, it is also 
evident that different immunotherapeutic agents can boost abscopal responses by targeting 
different aspects of the immune-mediated response9,17,27. For example, FLT3L can be used 
to recruit and stimulate APCs17,18,32, anti-CD40 can be employed to increase activation of 
APCs33, and anti-CTLA4 or antibodies against programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) can 
act as immune checkpoint inhibitors, increasing the T cell activity directed against tumour 
cells23,26,34.
Abscopal response factors
Preclinical studies indicate that appropriate timing, dosage and combinations are likely 
crucial to the success of combining radiotherapy and immunotherapy. Many studies have 
reported substantial abscopal responses when administering immunotherapy after 
radiotherapy17,18,20–26,33–40. However, the optimal timing is not clear. In one study on 
colorectal carcinoma, anti-CTLA4 was effective in generating abscopal responses when 
given before radiotherapy36, which is explained by the depletion of Treg cells in response to 
anti-CTLA4; meanwhile, in another study using the syngeneic mammary carcinoma 4T1 
model, anti-CTLA4 administered after radiotherapy generated substantial abscopal 
responses20. Most ongoing trials utilize concurrent immune checkpoint blockade with 
radiotherapy27. More preclinical studies and clinical trials investigating the timing for 
different immunotherapy and tumour types will further clarify the issue of optimal timing.
On the basis of the preclinical studies (TABLE 1), the optimal dosing and fractionation 
strategy for each cancer type has not been determined yet, as both single and fractionated 
radiotherapy doses have been reported to boost abscopal responses when combined with 
different immunotherapies23,34,41. For example, a preclinical study combining radiotherapy 
with anti-CTLA4 for breast and colon cancer models concluded that 3 fractions of 8 Gy and 
5 fractions of 6 Gy are superior to a single ablative dose of 20 Gy (REF. 23). However, other 
work in breast and colon cancer models has also shown synergy when using a single fraction 
of radiotherapy with other immunotherapies18,25,26,33,34,36,39,40,42,43.

 Multiple preclinical studies have investigated different dose and fractionation regimens in 
colon cancer (MC38 and colon26)23,42, breast cancer (TUBO, 67NR, TSA and 
FM3A)17,23,34,40, squamous cell carcinoma (SCCVII)21, sarcoma (MethA)42 and large-cell 
lung carcinoma42. Generally larger doses per fraction were associated with abscopal effects. 
An optimal dose range is likely to exist, below which immune stimulation might be 
suboptimal and above which immunosuppression prevails44. Seminal studies using breast 
cancer models showed that the DNA exonuclease 3 repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1) inhibits 
immune activation45,46. TREX1 is induced by radiation doses above 12–18 Gy in different 
colorectal carcinoma and breast cancer cell lines, and it attenuates immunogenicity by 
degrading double-strand DNA that accumulates in the cytosol upon radiation47. Further 
investigations of dosage and combinations of radiotherapy with immunotherapy are needed 
to determine the optimal thresholds or range48. Currently, a wide range of dose and 
fractionation schedules is being utilized in clinical studies of metastatic tumours. A recent 
review highlights the ongoing clinical trials testing these different combinations of 
radiotherapy with immunotherapy27.
Many studies investigating the abscopal effect have used bilateral subcutaneous tumour 
mouse models, in which the treated tumours on one flank of the animals represented primary 
tumours in patients and the untreated control tumours on the other flank of the animals 
represented metastasis17,20–23,26,33–38. Clearly, these subcutaneous tumours are a limited 
recapitulation of the tumour microenvironments of primary and metastatic tumours in 
patients. Still, these studies have advanced the understanding of the abscopal effect, and 
some results have been confirmed in clinical trials. For example, in one recent study26, 
patients with melanoma received hypofractionated radiotherapy targeting a single index 
lesion, in combination with systemic delivery of anti-CTLA4. When unirradiated lesions 
were analysed, this treatment showed a partial response as best response in 18% of the 
patients. When mice with bilateral subcutaneous melanoma tumours received radiotherapy 
on one flank and systemic delivery of anti-CTLA4, a response rate of about 17% was 
observed in unirradiated tumours of the other flank, consistent with the clinical trial 
outcomes. Nevertheless, relatively higher rates of abscopal response or efficacy in mice 
treated with the combination therapy compared with single-therapy-treated mice or untreated 
controls observed in many other preclinical studies17,23,33,40–42 have not been confirmed in 
clinical trials. Additional investigations in animal models that are more representative of 
patient tumours, such as orthotopic tumour mouse models, would be valuable (reviewed in 
REF. 49).
Limitations
A number of limitations have emerged from the available experimental and clinical data 
testing the combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy. One obvious limitation is the 
prevailing lack of sufficient understanding of the mechanism underlying the abscopal effect. 
A greater understanding is needed to best leverage the abscopal effect and benefit a larger 
proportion of patients.

 Immunosuppression
Even when combining radiotherapy with immunotherapy, the development of a robust 
abscopal response can still be stifled by the widespread presence of immunosuppression or 
tolerance at tumour sites. Low immunogenicity of tumour antigens at the local site of 
irradiation and the prevalence of immunosuppressive cells (for example, MDSCs and Treg 
cells) and/or of immunosuppressive cytokines (for example, interleukin-10 (IL-10) and 
TGFβ) work together to limit the abscopal response elicited even by combination 
approaches. An excellent example of this is a recent study in melanoma combining 
radiotherapy with anti-CTLA4 that led to a limited abscopal effect, as described above26. 
This study found that radiotherapy and anti-CTLA4 led to upregulation of PDL1 on tumour 
cells, mediating T cell exhaustion and explaining at least in part the limited abscopal 
responses observed. Immune-mediated abscopal effects are also likely to be affected by such 
factors as the patient’s degree of myelosuppression, overall tumour burden and the 
neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio in addition to the patient’s prior exposure to radiotherapy or 
cytotoxic chemotherapy27. The depletion of immune cells, or lymphopaenia, observed in 
most patients with cancer is likely to decrease the chances of an effective immune response. 
Hypoxic regions within tumours can also contribute to immunosuppression50. For example, 
chemokines induced by tumour-associated hypoxia enable recruitment of 
immunosuppressive Treg cells, as shown in ovarian cancer51. Hypoxia is also known to alter 
the capacity of APCs in antigen presentation and can make tumour cells more resistant to T 
cell-mediated killing, as shown in a murine model of breast cancer52. In general, any factors 
that suppress the immune system may hamper the development of robust abscopal 
responses.
Toxicities
While rational combinations of radiotherapy and immunotherapy could overcome 
immunosuppression and lead to vigorous antitumour T cell responses14,18, the systemic and 
overlapping toxicities from such a combination could be a substantial obstacle30,53. 
Immune-related adverse events that can be severe or life-threatening have been seen 
following treatment with immunomodulatory agents such as ipilimumab and anti-PD1 
antibodies53,54. Combining radiotherapy with immunotherapy, which affects different steps 
in the immune response, might increase the likelihood of these adverse events48. Immune-
related adverse events of concern include dermatological, gastrointestinal, hepatic, endocrine 
and other, less common inflammatory events55. For example, early studies combining 
radiotherapy with interferon-α (IFNα) in pancreatic cancer were promising56, but the phase 
II trial showed unacceptably high rates of toxicity using this treatment57.
Unfortunately, preclinical studies investigating toxicities do not adequately predict the range 
of pathology that is observed in humans. For example, hypophysitis, a somewhat common 
side effect of ipilimumab, was not anticipated from experimental studies in mouse 
models48,49. Initial clinical experience suggests that routine palliative radiotherapy is likely 
to be well tolerated in the setting of anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1 therapy58, and ongoing 
clinical trials for different indications27 will help provide the needed additional prospective 
data on toxicities and efficacy.

 Overcoming immunosuppression
Strategies under investigation for improving outcomes when combining radiotherapy with 
immunotherapy include promoting cross-priming of tumour-specific CD8+ T cells, 
stimulating the immune effector function of T cells primed by radiotherapy and neutralizing 
the immunosuppressive effects of the tumour microenvironment30. Ongoing studies are 
investigating optimal timing, dosage and combinations with different immunotherapeutic 
agents relevant to these strategies26,27,47,59. As an example, an approach to overcome 
immunosuppression is to use multiple immunotherapeutic agents, as highlighted in a recent 
melanoma study describing PDL1-mediated immunosuppression when tumours were treated 
with a combination of radiotherapy and anti-CTLA4, as described above, and employing a 
combination of anti-CTLA4 and anti-PDL1 to overcome this immunosuppression26. The 
study showed that radiotherapy increases the diversity of the T cell receptor repertoire of 
intratumoural T cells and that anti-CTLA4 inhibits immunosuppressive Treg cells, while the 
addition of PDL1 blockade reverses T cell exhaustion to mitigate the decrease in the CD8+ T 
cell:Treg cell ratio and further encourage oligoclonal T cell expansion. Hence, radiotherapy 
combined with immunotherapeutic agents that have different mechanisms of action might 
boost abscopal response rates.
Intratumoural administration of immunotherapeutic agents in combination with radiotherapy 
has been shown to be effective in overcoming immunosuppression in lymphoma60,61. This is 
particularly relevant when using immunotherapies that target specific immune cells within 
the tumour microenvironment; hence, it may be preferable to deliver these agents locally 
into the tumour rather than systemically. Local delivery of the immunotherapeutic agent 
allows for much higher or more potent concentrations in the tumour microenvironment than 
via systemic delivery. In one example of intratumoural delivery, toll-like receptor (TLR) 
agonists were administered to generate potent abscopal responses in combination with low-
dose radiotherapy62. In particular, 15 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma were treated 
with radiotherapy (2 × 2 Gy) at a single site with concomitant intratumoural administration 
of 6 mg synthetic CpG oligodeoxynucleotides, which act as a TLR9 agonist. The results 
after 12 weeks showed objective abscopal responses at distant non-treated sites in 4 of the 15 
patients62.
Strategies that can minimize hypoxia in the tumour microenvironment could also help 
overcome immunosuppression and radioresistance. For example, hypoxia-inducible factor 
modulators such as dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG)63 can inhibit immunosuppressive 
hypoxic signalling50,63. Furthermore, the use of charged particle radiotherapy might 
promote uniform cell killing in tumours that have heterogeneous radiosensitivity as a result 
of intermittent normoxic and hypoxic regions within the tumour. This approach takes 
advantage of high linear energy transfer (LET), which uses dense ionization tracks that 
inflict direct DNA damage, showing high biological effectiveness because of less 
dependency on oxygenation of tissues64. Increased generation of neoantigens by higher LET 
radiation may also increase the potential for generating an abscopal response.
Most reported cases of the abscopal effect occur in immunogenic tumours7,9,65,66. A high 
level of tumour immunogenicity is important for favourable treatment outcomes, and

 treatment strategies should focus on developing combination therapies that increase 
immunogenicity through increasing immunogenic cancer cell death67–69. Such strategies 
aim at inducing a specific level of cell death that can generate sufficient neoantigens, and 
specific danger signals, to help overcome the condition of local immunosuppression which is 
characteristic of established tumours70. Studies indicate that tumour immunogenicity may be 
increased by the use of protons or carbon ion radiotherapy and α-particles, which are 
considered to have high LET71.
The combination of radiotherapy with anticancer vaccines and checkpoint inhibitors has 
been shown to overcome immunosuppression and to increase response rates in preclinical 
models72. For example, a promising strategy involving sequential combination of 
radiotherapy, vaccination and anti-PDL1 in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer converts 
non-T-cell-inflamed cancers into T cell-inflamed cancers and mediates regression of 
established pancreatic tumours72. Other groups are also investigating the use of irradiated 
tumour cell vaccines as a strategy to boost therapeutic outcomes73–75. In one such study 
using a B16 melanoma model74, it was shown that irradiated tumour cells that were 
genetically modified to express murine GM-CSF stimulated potent, long-lasting and specific 
antitumour immunity. The study demonstrated the potential for clinical use of genetically 
modified tumour cells as anticancer vaccines. The treatment of tumour-bearing mice with 
radiotherapy combined with dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccines has shown substantial 
increases in antitumour efficacy compared to tumour-bearing mice treated with single 
therapies or untreated controls, in mouse models of squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma 
and fibrosarcoma21,25,39 (TABLE 1).
Using smart materials technologies
Smart materials technologies, including nanoparticles and smart radiotherapy biomaterials 
(SRBs)76, provide great opportunities to address the above limitations to priming the 
abscopal effect (BOX 1). There are a number of reasons why smart materials may help 
overcome immunosuppression.
Box 1
Smart materials technologies for boosting the abscopal effect
Contemporaneous developments in smart materials technologies offer potential solutions 
for addressing limitations of immunosuppression and toxicity. Smart materials76 are 
designed to be sensitive to specific stimuli (for example, tumour microenvironment, pH, 
the wavelength or intensity of incident radiation or an electrical or magnetic field) and to 
then respond in active ways, including changing their structure for drug delivery, priming 
an immune response or other functions that have the potential to cogently improve 
treatment outcomes. Examples of smart materials technologies worth consideration, with 
perspective on boosting the abscopal effect with minimal toxicities, include nanoparticles 
and smart radiotherapy biomaterials (SRBs)2,76,108.
One distinctive feature of nanoparticles highlighted in oncological applications is their 
potential for improving the therapeutic index of a drug by increasing effectiveness and/or 
reducing toxicities (reviewed in REF. 108).

 Beside nanoparticles, it has been proposed that currently used inert radiotherapy 
biomaterials (fiducials, spacers, beacons, and so on) can be replaced with SRBs loaded 
with drugs for therapy modulation76,109. The currently used inert radiotherapy 
biomaterials have only one function, which is to ensure geometric accuracy during 
treatment109. They could be replaced with multifunctional SRBs, which provide 
geometric accuracy but can also deliver drug payloads110. Currently proposed SRB 
designs incorporate smart polymer components76,111,112 that can sense and actuate or 
change structure to release payloads incorporated in their polymer matrix in a controlled 
way.
Following implantation, as currently done for inert radiotherapy biomaterials, the SRBs 
can be activated by the tumour microenvironment or other stimuli to sustainably release 
the payloads in situ and directly into the tumour (FIG. 2). During radiotherapy, antigens 
from the dying tumour cells could serve as an in situ vaccine, working in conjunction 
with the released immunotherapeutic agent to potentiate the immune-mediated abscopal 
effect.
Targeted nanoparticles could be loaded with potent immunotherapeutic payloads that can be 
delivered controllably or sustainably during radiotherapy to prime abscopal responses more 
efficaciously, overcoming immunosuppression. A recent review highlights studies showing 
that the use of nanoparticles to deliver immunotherapy can boost antitumour immune 
responses77. In one study using a mouse model of melanoma, targeted delivery of CpG 
oligodeoxynucleotides by nanoparticles to DCs in the draining lymph node increased the 
CD8+ T cell:Treg cell ratio, delaying tumour growth compared with mice receiving immune 
adjuvant-free nanoparticles78. In another study using a mouse model of melanoma, 
nanoparticles were used to deliver CTLA4-targeting small interfering RNA (siCTLA4) into 
T cells at tumour sites, resulting in increased T-cell mediated antitumour immune responses 
in mice receiving siCTLA4-loaded nanoparticles compared with melanoma-bearing mice 
receiving control nanoparticles79. The combination of this therapy with radiotherapy 
promises to boost the abscopal effect more effectively.
High-atomic-number nanoparticles such as gold nanoparticles may also be employed to 
increase tumour immunogenicity by leveraging the photoelectric effect, in which radiation 
can induce the emission of micrometre-range photoelectrons and Auger electrons2. These 
Auger electrons have high LET and the potential to inflict more irreparable mutations upon 
tumour cell DNA, which could help by increasing tumour immunogenicity or overcoming 
immunosuppressive hypoxia2,80,81.
A merit of using nanoparticles is that they could also serve as imaging contrast agents, 
which could be valuable in image-guided drug delivery of immunotherapy to boost the 
abscopal effect. Nanoparticles such as gadolinium nanoparticles have the potential to 
improve radiotherapy82,83 but also provide magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast, 
which would resonate with recent IGRT developments towards MRI-guided 
radiotherapy82,84,85. The use of nanoparticles with image contrast capability could also 
facilitate non-invasive monitoring of the effect of radiotherapy and immunotherapy

 combinations on tumour progression, as shown in recent studies, with nanoparticles 
designed to allow tracking of cancer-specific T cells in vivo86,87.
The use of SRBs76 for sustained delivery of immunotherapeutic payloads could also help 
overcome immunosuppression, especially given the persistent and contemporaneous 
presence of antigen and adjuvant signalling in the tumour microenvironment, which may not 
be attainable in the case of intratumoural delivery of immunotherapy that can diffuse away 
fairly rapidly. The advantage of a sustained delivery is predicated on promising results from 
vaccine studies, which have shown that sustained delivery of a vaccine using biomaterials 
elicits increased proliferation of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells compared with the effect 
elicited by delivery of the same vaccine through injections88. Consistent with expectations 
from these studies, preliminary data indicate an increase in abscopal responses in Lewis lung 
carcinoma-tumour-bearing mice treated with radiotherapy in combination with anti-CD40 
delivered through SRBs compared with mice receiving radiotherapy in combination with 
anti-CD40 delivered through injections (W.N., O.C.I. and J.D.S., unpublished observations). 
Besides this, the use of SRBs for sustained in situ delivery of payloads is a relatively more 
convenient way to deliver immunotherapeutic agents than repeated intratumoural 
injections49.
Another merit of using SRBs is that the use of polymers such as poly(lactic-co-glycolic-
acid) (PLGA) or chitosan as components of these SRBs could itself have a major effect in 
priming an immune response. Recent studies89,90 have shown that these particular polymers, 
used in prototype SRBs76, support the maturation of DCs. Studies also showed that DCs 
treated with PLGA and chitosan films supported higher levels of T cell proliferation than 
control DCs91–93. In parallel, biomaterials have been shown to increase the immunogenicity 
of antigens. For example, adsorption of ovalbumin to PLGA scaffolds has been found to 
support antibody-mediated immune responses94–96. Taken together, there is compelling 
evidence from these studies that intelligently engineered SRBs may engender pro-
immunogenic activity, which would be helpful in overcoming the commonly encountered 
local immunosuppression of established tumours.
Minimizing toxicities
Dose optimization and focused delivery
To minimize toxicities when combining radiotherapy and immunotherapy, a standard 
strategy is to use as low as reasonably possible doses of radiotherapy and immunotherapy 
that would engender optimal therapeutic outcomes. With respect to radiotherapy, 
retrospective studies highlight that conformal radiation dose delivery, with the radiotherapy 
beam shaped to tightly conform to the tumour margins, is crucial for minimizing 
toxicity53,97. The use of advanced conformal radiotherapy treatment modalities such as 
IMRT, SABR or proton therapy would allow for substantial reductions in radiation toxicity. 
HDR brachytherapy or short-distance radiotherapy, which brings radioactive sources close to 
tumour tissue, is specifically designed to reduce toxicity to neighbouring healthy tissue. A 
recent study on colorectal carcinoma has shown that HDR brachytherapy combined with 
anti-PD1 or anti-CD137 monoclonal antibodies engendered abscopal responses35. Thus,

 such a combination approach could also be further developed with potential to minimize 
toxicity.
With respect to immunotherapy, the route of administration is crucial in determining 
toxicity. A major rationale for the approach of intratumoural delivery is that it can allow for 
reduction of systemic toxicity. This approach is supported by results from different 
studies60,61. As already mentioned, intratumoural administration of an escalated dose of 
CpG oligodeoxynucleotides in combination with low-dose radiotherapy was well tolerated 
in a trial of patients with follicular lymphoma61. In another study, intratumoural 
administration of ipilimumab at one-hundredth of the systemic dose was found to be active, 
safe and well tolerated in lymphoma60,98. These studies indicate that the relative safety of 
intratumoural therapies offers advantages as we move into a future with increasing 
combination therapies. An acknowledged limitation of the intratumoural therapy approach is 
that it is limited to specific, accessible tumour types where direct intratumoural 
administration of the immunotherapy is feasible. Overall, more studies investigating the 
optimal dosing or scheduling to optimize both radiotherapy and immunotherapy dose and 
manner of administration are needed.
Delivery through smart materials
It has been demonstrated that the use of targeted biocompatible gold nanoparticles loaded 
with immunotherapeutic agents can improve the delivery and safety of immunotherapy77. 
The use of such high-atomic-number nanoparticles could also avail efforts to minimize 
radiation toxicity2. Radiation-induced photoelectrons and Auger electrons can substantially 
boost local damage to tumour cells, allowing a reduction in the dose or number of fractions 
of primary radiation to be administered. As such, this could minimize radiation toxicity to 
normal tissues and/or lymphopaenia. Reducing the number of treatment fractions could also 
help improve patients’ compliance and reduce the financial cost of treatments. Besides gold 
nanoparticles, platinum-based chemotherapy drugs (for example, cisplatin or carboplatin) 
loaded on nanoparticles could also provide a multi-pronged approach for combining 
chemoradiotherapy with immunotherapy, potentially resulting in more potent local and 
metastatic tumour cell killing with reduced toxicities.
An advantage of using SRBs is that the direct and sustained delivery of the respective 
immunotherapeutic agent has potential to substantially minimize systemic or overlapping 
toxicities99. For example, the clinical use of agonistic anti-CD40 antibodies has been 
blocked by dose-limiting toxicities100. CD40 is expressed by B cells, macrophages and DCs 
throughout the body, and systemic administration leads to immune-related adverse events, 
such as cytokine release syndrome and liver toxicity. An agonistic anti-CD40 antibody 
delivery system based on a slow-release agent would cause fewer side effects than systemic 
therapy99,100. SRB delivery systems offer great promise in the context of combining 
radiotherapy with immunotherapy.
Biomarkers
Studies designed to monitor different biomarkers should also provide valuable information 
to improve our understanding of boosting abscopal responses. Validated biomarkers could

 help inform patient selection, monitor treatment response or help identify optimal treatment 
strategies to overcome immunosuppression with minimal toxicities. Studies investigating the 
combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy could introduce biomarkers (for example, 
measurement of tumour-associated macrophages, MDSCs and Treg cells) to facilitate the 
design and fine-tuning of approaches. For example, recent preclinical evidence suggests that 
TREX1 induction could guide the selection of optimal radiation dose and fractionation in 
patients treated with radiotherapy and immunotherapy47.
Because determining the optimal dose or BED includes comparison of the rates of tumour 
cell killing for different fractionations or schedules in radiotherapy, it also informs what 
timing or schedules are best in generating an abscopal effect. A recent review44 supports the 
use of SABR treatment schedules. Machine learning and modelling applied to data from 
clinical trials27 could shed further light on the optimal BED and timing for different tumour 
tissue types.
TABLE 2 summarizes the merits and demerits of different approaches that have been 
discussed for boosting the abscopal effect. Evidently, studies that will continue to advance 
mechanistic understanding of the abscopal effect will avail efforts in developing these 
approaches. Besides the understanding that T cells are required to mediate the abscopal 
effect during radiotherapy17, cytokine release has been suggested as another mechanism to 
mediate the abscopal effect101. This has been supported by the fact that the production of 
tumour necrosis factor in the irradiated tumour microenvironment in mice can reduce the 
number of immunosuppressive MDSCs34.
Another potential marker predictive of response to immunotherapy and radiotherapy is the 
induction of calreticulin. Sublethal radiation exposure of tumour cells enhanced antigen 
processing and increased calreticulin expression on human breast, lung and prostate 
carcinoma cells compared with untreated control cells102. In these different carcinoma types, 
tumour cells that had been exposed to radiotherapy were significantly more sensitive to T 
cell killing, suggesting that the increased T cell killing is a consequence of direct interaction 
of the exposed calreticulin with T cells. It was also reported that knockdown or depletion of 
calreticulin in cancer cells resulted in decreased T cell killing of calreticulin-deficient cancer 
cells compared with control cells102.
The promise of intratumoural therapy
The preclinical studies in TABLE 1 employ subcutaneous tumours in mice as the primary 
site and report positive abscopal responses. These outcomes suggest that subcutaneous 
tumours can be treated with radiotherapy and immunotherapy to modulate robust abscopal 
responses that can inhibit tumour growth or metastatic progression in distant untreated sites, 
and they offer a strategy in which subcutaneous tumours or metastasis in patients could be 
targeted as the primary site to prime or modulate a robust abscopal response. Such patients 
may then benefit from the advantages of intratumoural delivery or use of SRBs whose main 
limitation is access to the primary tumour site. A substantial number of patients with cancer 
with cutaneous metastasis could benefit from such a subcutaneous modulation approach. In 
one retrospective study of 7,316 patients covering a range of tumour types, 367 patients 
Ngwa et al.

 (5%) showed incidence of cutaneous metastasis103. In another study104, 1,080 patients out of 
20,380 patients with a range of cancer types had cutaneous metastasis. Given the potential 
benefit, such a therapy approach is worth further investigation, using animal models with 
both subcutaneous tumours and orthotopic tumours with metastasis.
Conclusions
Many decades after the rare abscopal effect was first described, research developments 
provide increasing evidence that the use of radiotherapy with immunotherapy could boost 
the abscopal effect. Persisting challenges in overcoming established cancer 
immunosuppression and mitigating dose-limiting toxicities remain. Many studies are 
ongoing to address these limitations and to better understand how to optimize combinations 
of radiotherapy and immunotherapy. With parallel developments in smart materials 
technologies, there is great motivation for more cross-disciplinary research, which can 
leverage these discoveries to address current limitations and boost the application of 
radiotherapy to the treatment of both local and metastatic disease. Metastasis accounts for 
over 90% of cancer-related death and suffering105–107. Hence, boosting radiation-induced 
abscopal response rates could substantially impact patient care far beyond the patients who 
now benefit from radiotherapy or immunotherapy alone. Overall, there is a considerable 
impetus for more concerted research collaborations combining radiotherapy and 
immunotherapy with smart materials science in boosting the abscopal effect, thereby 
improving patient outcomes and saving more lives.

 Figure 2. Mechanism of the abscopal effect
Radiation generates neoantigens from tumour cells. Antigens from damaged tumour cells 
can be taken up by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which travel to the lymph node to prime 
the T cell-mediated abscopal effect. Activated T cells directed against tumour-specific 
antigens then infiltrate the primary tumour and non- irradiated tumour metastases. The use 
of smart radiotherapy biomaterials (SRBs) and nanoparticles provides promising avenues to 
boost abscopal response rates. Nanoparticles can amplify damage to the tumour cells owing 
to radiation-induced emission of micrometre-range missile-like photoelectrons and Auger 
electrons. Immunotherapeutic agents loaded in the SRBs and/or nanoparticles can be 
sustainably released to boost abscopal responses by targeting different aspects of the 
immune-mediated abscopal response process. For example, anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody 
could be employed to increase activation of the APCs, while antibodies against cytotoxic T 
lymphocyte- associated antigen (CTLA4), programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) or PD1 
ligand 1 (PDL1) can act as immune checkpoint inhibitors, increasing the T cell activity 
directed against tumour cells at irradiated as well as non-irradiated tumour sites. Please note 
that the relative sizes of SRBs, nanoparticles and immunotherapeutic agents as depicted are 
notproportional. FASL, FAS ligand; MHCI, major histocompatibility complex class I.
