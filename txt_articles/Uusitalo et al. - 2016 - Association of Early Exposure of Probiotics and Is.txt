IMPORTANCE Probiotics have been hypothesized to affect immunologic responses to
environmental exposures by supporting healthy gut microbiota and could therefore
theoretically be used to prevent the development of type 1 diabetes mellitus
(T1DM)–associated islet autoimmunity.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association between supplemental probiotic use during the first
year of life and islet autoimmunity among children at increased genetic risk of T1DM.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this ongoing prospective cohort study that started
September 1, 2004, children from 6 clinical centers, 3 in the United States (Colorado,
Georgia/Florida, and Washington) and 3 in Europe (Finland, Germany, and Sweden), were
followed up for T1DM-related autoantibodies. Blood samples were collected every 3 months
between 3 and 48 months of age and every 6 months thereafter to determine persistent islet
autoimmunity. Details of infant feeding, including probiotic supplementation and infant
formula use, were monitored from birth using questionnaires and diaries. We applied
time-to-event analysis to study the association between probiotic use and islet
autoimmunity, stratifying by country and adjusting for family history of type 1 diabetes,
HLA-DR-DQ genotypes, sex, birth order, mode of delivery, exclusive breastfeeding, birth year,
child’
s antibiotic use, and diarrheal history, as well as maternal age, probiotic use, and
smoking. Altogether 8676 infants with an eligible genotype were enrolled in the follow-up
study before the age of 4 months. The final sample consisted of 7473 children with the age
range of 4 to 10 years (as of October 31, 2014).
EXPOSURES Early intake of probiotics.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Islet autoimmunity revealed by specific islet
autoantibodies.
RESULTS Early probiotic supplementation (at the age of 0-27 days) was associated with a
decreased risk of islet autoimmunity when compared with probiotic supplementation after 27
days or no probiotic supplementation (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66; 95% CI, 0.46-0.94). The
association was accounted for by children with the DR3/4 genotype (HR, 0.40; 95% CI,
0.21-0.74) and was absent among other genotypes (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.62-1.54).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Early probiotic supplementation may reduce the risk of islet
autoimmunity in children at the highest genetic risk of T1DM. The result needs to be
confirmed in further studies before any recommendation of probiotics use is made.

A
newborn infant’
s immune system needs to quickly
learn how to tolerate beneficial bacteria and defend
against opportunistic pathogens. The intestinal micro-
biota can influence the balance between proinflammatory and
regulatory immune responses.1 However, there are still unan-
swered questions as to how the immune system interacts with
the microbiota.2,3
A healthy gut microbiota is believed to favorably regulate
mucosalbarrierfunction4andreduceintestinalpermeability.5,6
Abnormalities in gut permeability have been linked to the de-
velopment of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).7 Healthy gut
microbiota may also enhance the overall maturation of the in-
fantimmunesystem8,9andexcludepathogenscompetitively.10
Imbalance in gut microbiota and a relative decrease in
α-diversity are associated with T1DM according to a recent
study.11 A larger proportion of the phylum Bacteroidetes has
been observed in children with T1DM.12-14
Microbial colonization of the infant gut starts in utero,15 al-
though frequent changes in gut microbiota, mainly in relative
abundancesofspecies,havebeenobservedduringthefirst10to
12monthsoflife.16-19Earlylifeevents,suchasmodeofdelivery,
earlyenvironment,includinghygienemeasures,andearlyfeed-
ing,arethoughttoinitiallysetthetrajectoryofcolonization.20,21
Eventhoughα-diversitymaybelarge,straincompositionwithin
an individual typically remains constant throughout infancy.11
Probiotics have been defined as live organisms that, when
administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on
the host.22 Administration of probiotics to healthy infants is
considered safe.23,24 However, it is still unclear whether pro-
biotics as an early dietary factor could modify the infant gut
microbiota trajectory and disease susceptibility.
Studies25,26 on manipulation of gut microbiota by probi-
otics and consequent changes in the risk of developing T1DM-
related autoimmunity have mainly used animal models. Pro-
biotics induce favorable immunomodulation, and it has been
suggested that probiotic treatment could prevent T1DM. The
aimofthisstudyistoexaminetheassociationbetweensupple-
mental probiotic use during the first year of life and islet
autoimmunity (IA) among children at increased risk of T1DM.
Methods
The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young
(TEDDY) is a prospective cohort study with the primary goal
to identify environmental causes of T1DM. It includes 6 clini-
cal research centers (3 in the United States and 3 in Europe):
University of Colorado Health Science Center, Georgia
Regents University, Pacific Northwest Diabetes Research In-
stitute, Turku University Hospital, Institute of Diabetes
Research, and Lund University. Detailed study design and
methods have been previously published.27,28 The study was
approved by the local institutional review or ethics boards and
is monitored by an external advisory board formed by the
National Institutes of Health. Written informed consent was
obtained for all study participants from a parent or primary
caretaker for genetic screening and participation in prospec-
tive follow-up.
Study Population
From September 1, 2004, through February 28, 2010, a total
of 424 788 newborns in the university hospitals affiliated with
the clinical research centers were screened with parents’con-
sent for T1DM-associated HLA genotypes.29 The screening
identified 21 589 eligible infants, of whom 8676 were en-
rolled in the follow-up study before the age of 4 months. Chil-
dren who were followed up for less than 12 months (n = 1032)
or whose islet autoantibody status was indeterminate (n = 55)
were excluded. Because of HLA ineligibility, 116 additional
study participants were removed from the analyses. The fi-
nal sample for this study consisted of 7473 children with an
age range of 4 to 10 years (as of October 31, 2014).
HLA Typing
Infants from the general population, with no first- degree rela-
tive (FDR) with T1DM, were eligible for the study if they had
any one of the following HLA genotypes: (1) DR4-DQA1*
03-DQB1*03:02/DR3-DQA1*05:01-DQB1*02:01, (2) DR4-
DQA1*03-DQB1*03:02/DR4-DQA1*03-DQB1*03:02, (3) DR4-
DQA1*03- DQB1*03:02/DR8-DQA1*04:01-DQB1*04:02, and
(4) DR3-DQA1*05:01- DQB1*02:01/DR3-DQA1*05:01-DQB1*02:
01. Acceptable DQB1 alleles in any haplotype listed as
DQB1*03:02 also include DQB1*03:04. For the above geno-
types, any DR4 of the subtype DRB1*04:03 is ineligible.
Infants who have an FDR with T1DM were eligible for en-
rollment if they had any of the following HLA genotypes:
(1) DR4-DQA1*03- DQB1*03:02/DR3-DQA1*05:01-DQB1*02:
01, (2) DR4-DQA1*03- DQB1*03:02/DR4-DQA1*03-DQB1*03:
02,(3)DR4-DQA1*03-DQB1*03:02/DR8-DQA1*04:01-DQB1*04:

DQB1*03:03, and (9) DR3-DQA1*05:01-DQB1*02:01/DR9-
DQA1*03-DQB1*03:03. Acceptable DQB1 alleles in any
haplotype listed as DQB1*03:02 also include DQB1*03:04. All
HLA genotypes are referred to in the text by their abbreviated
nameslistingonlyDRalleles(i.e.DR3/4forgenotype[1]above).
At a Glance
•Probiotics are live organisms that may confer health benefits
on the host.
•The aim of this study was to examine the association between
early probiotic exposure and islet autoimmunity among children
in The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young
study.
•Early administration of probiotics, during the first 27 days of life,
may be associated with reduced risk of islet autoimmunity
(hazard ratio [HR], 0.66; 95% CI, 0.45-0.96) among children who
were genetically at increased risk for type 1 diabetes mellitus.
•This reduced risk of islet autoimmunity was primarily observed in
children with the highest-risk HLA genotype of DR3/4 (HR, 0.40;
95% CI, 0.21-0.74) but not in children with the other, moderately
higher-risk genotypes (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.62-1.54).

the seroconverters (n = 601), and the mean (SD) age at the last
follow-up for children without IA was 65.6 (28.0) months.
Characteristics and Diet and Health Monitoring
of the Study Population
Information about basic demographic characteristics and fam-
ily history of diabetes was received from the infant screening
form. A questionnaire on maternal medications, smoking hab-
its,andprobioticdietarysupplementuseduringpregnancywas
mailed to the mothers of enrolled children and completed at 3
to 4 months post partum. After enrollment, parents also re-
ceivedaquestionnaireonmodeofdeliveryandchild’
searlydiet,
including the use of probiotics at 0 to 3 months of age. Parents
wereadvisedtoconsistentlymaintainadiaryafterthefirstclinic
visit to collect information on child illnesses and diet. The start
age of the probiotic supplement and each type of infant for-
mula were recorded. Information about the mother’
s educa-
tional level and birth order of the child was received from the
primary caretaker questionnaire at the 9-month clinical visit.
Probiotic exposure was defined as timing of first introduction
of probiotics via dietary supplement or infant formula. Clini-
cal center study nurses reviewed the questionnaires and dia-
ries with the parent at clinic visits or over the telephone every
3 months to minimize missing and inaccurate information.
Statistical Analysis
Thecharacteristicsofprobioticusersforthestudychildrenand
their mothers were examined one by one using a Cochran-
Mantel-Haenszel test and simultaneously using a logistic re-
gression model adjusting for country. The association be-
tween the probiotic exposure age and IA was examined among
those who were exposed to probiotics during the first year of
life. For exploratory analyses, we categorized these individu-
als according to the probiotic exposure age into 3 equally sized
groups (0-27 days, 28-90 days, and 91-365 days) and com-
paredthemwiththeindividualswithoutprobioticexposuredur-
ingthefirstyear(>365days)whenstudyingtheassociationwith
IA. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was applied
to study the association between timing of probiotic exposure
and occurrence of IA.
TheCoxproportionalhazardsregressionmodelsweresimul-
taneously adjusted for HLA-DR-DQ genotype (DR3/4 vs other),
T1DM-related FDR status (yes/no), sex (female vs male), mode
ofdelivery(cesareandeliveryvsother),andexclusivebreastfeed-
ing duration (≥3 vs <3 months) and stratified for country using
theSTRATAstatementwithinthemodel.Themodelswerealso

could be associated with IA or T1DM: maternal age (≤24, 25-29
[reference],30-34,and≥35years),maternalsmokingduringpreg-
nancy (yes/no), maternal probiotic use during pregnancy (yes/
no), birth year, birth order (first born child vs others), diarrheal
history, and antibiotic use of the child (yes/no).33,34
Because early IA may have preceded the probiotic expo-
sure, a sensitivity analysis of the association between timing of
probiotic exposure and occurrence of IA was conducted by ex-
cluding the individuals who developed IA during the first year
of life (n = 106) to eliminate the effect of the ordering between
IAandprobioticexposure.Theresultsfromthesensitivityanaly-
sis indicated only minor changes in the estimated parameters
(hazard ratios [HRs] and P values) and led to the same conclu-
sions as when including all individuals in the model.
All tests for significance were 2-tailed with a significance
level of .05. SAS statistical software, version 9.3 (SAS Insti-
tute Inc), was used for all statistical analyses.
Results
Probiotic supplementation, from dietary supplements or in-
fant formula, varied by country (Table 1). It was most preva-
lent in Finland (869 [52.4%]) and Germany (237 [46.8%]) dur-
ing the first year of life. Most of the Finnish children (827
[95.2%]) had received probiotics from dietary supplements,
whereas in Germany, probiotic infant formulas (214 [90.3%])
were the most common sources of probiotics. The median age
for first exposure to probiotics was 42 days. Overall, children
bornattheendoftherecruitmentperiod(2009-2010)were4.9
times more likely (P < .001) to be given probiotics than those
borninthebeginningofthestudyperiod(2004-2005)(Table2).

Kaplan-Meier curves of developing IA suggested that the

the exposure of probiotics during 91 to 365 days had the high-

sis suggested that very early exposure to probiotics may be im-
portant in relation to IA (Table 3). Therefore, we decided to fo-
cus on the early exposure (at 0-27 days) and the risk of IA in
our further analyses. Early exposure of probiotics was associ-
ated with decreased risk of IA (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.46-0.94)
when compared with exposure after 27 days or no exposure
and adjusted for FDR status (P < .001), HLA-DR-DQ genotype
(P < .001), sex (P = .006), birth order (P = .15), mode of deliv-
ery (P = .46), maternal age (P = .98), maternal probiotic use
(P = .82),smokingduringpregnancy(P = .15),exclusivebreast-
feeding duration (P = .42), birth year (P = .70), child antibi-
otic use (P = .75), and diarrhea (P = .61).
Our analyses also revealed an interaction (P = .02) be-
tween early probiotic exposure (at 0-27 days) and HLA geno-
type in relation to IA. Separate analyses by HLA-DR-DQ geno-
type revealed a strong inverse association between early
probiotic exposure and IA among those with an HLA geno-
type of DR3/4 (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.21-0.74) but not among
other genotypes (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.62-1.54).
We did not find a statistically significant interaction be-
tween early probiotic exposure (0-27 days) and country
(P = .34). The country-specific HRs were not heterogeneous
(United States: HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.14-7.02; Finland: HR, 0.60;
95%CI,0.38-0.97;Germany:HR,0.98;95%CI,0.38-2.50;Swe-
den: HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.32-1.67), reflecting a possible protec-
tive association between early probiotic exposure and IA.
Discussion
In this multinational cohort study of children at increased ge-
netic risk of T1DM, we observed a reduction in the risk of IA in
the children who had received probiotics via dietary supple-
ments and/or via fortified infant formula before or at the age of
27 days compared with those who had first received probiotics
after 27 days or not at all. Early probiotic exposure was associ-
ated with 60% decrease in the risk of IA among children with
the DR3/4 genotype but not among other genotypes.

The strengths of the study included a large international
sample with consistent recording of the information on child
diet, including probiotics, and health conditions covering the
whole first year of life. A limitation of the study was that the
species and amounts of microbes from probiotics were not
studied.MostofthesupplementsusedbyTEDDYchildrencon-
tained mixtures of various Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium
species along with other commonly used probiotics. There-
fore, the effect of specific species could not be evaluated as has
been done in controlled clinical trials.35 In addition, the sta-
bility of probiotic bacteria is dependent on many factors (eg,
storage conditions).36,37 Therefore, it would not have been
possible to compare doses of probiotics.
ProbioticusevariedbetweenTEDDYcountries.Givingpro-
bioticsupplementstoneonatesisafairlynewtrend,particularly
in the United States.38 Even today probiotics are not recom-
mendedasaroutinesupplementationintheUnitedStateseven
though adverse events associated with probiotic use are ex-
tremelyrare.23,39,40Smallerpopulation-basedinterventionson
probiotic use and health outcomes among infants in Finland40
have received considerable attention by the media, which may
have boosted the consumption of probiotics in that country.
Antibiotic medication use was common at the ages of 3 to
12 months, and probiotic use was often associated with ad-
ministration of antibiotics. There is also evidence that antibi-
otic use may increase the risk of T1DM.34 This could contrib-
ute to the fact that we did not find a protective association
between later introduction of probiotics and the risk of IA. We
also have to consider that the probiotics may be able to modify
gut microbiota only in early life because after introduction of
solid foods, diet may have an overly dominant effect on gut
microbiota composition, making probiotic supplementation
less successful.41 Young infants are particularly susceptible to
infectious diseases.42 Lönnrot et al43 also noticed that respi-
ratory infections during early life in TEDDY were often accom-
panied by gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea, which
wefoundtobestronglyassociatedwithprobioticuse.Thevery
early weeks of life may open a window for probiotics to modify
gut microbiota favorably, thus helping the immune system of
an infant’
s gut to gain the maturity needed for correctly pro-
cessing new environmental exposures, such as pathogens.
Approximately 70% of all gastroenteritis cases are caused
by a virus,44 making an antibiotic treatment ineffective.
Probiotics are often prescribed instead to shorten diarrheal
episodes.44,45 Probiotic use was strongly associated with
gastroenteritis in TEDDY. Shortened duration of gastroenteri-
tis by probiotic treatment may protect infant gut from ex-
tended inflammation and adverse immunity-suppressing
consequences.45 This may partly explain why we did not find
anassociationbetweengastroenteritisandIAeventhoughsuch
an association has been suggested earlier.46,47
Both T1DM and T1DM-related autoimmunity have multi-
factorialorigins.33,48,49Contributingfactorsandtheirinterplay
withprobioticscouldalsovaryamongcountries.Therecentob-
servationofaplateauintheincidenceofT1DMinFinland50sug-
gests changes in environmental exposures, for example, in se-
rum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations.51 The increasing
trend of probiotic use40,52 also preceded the plateauing rates
of T1DM. Respiratory tract infections at an early age have been
foundtobeassociatedwithIA.53Earlyuseofprobioticsandrela-
tively lower rates of the common cold before 3 months of age
in Finland also warrant further study. However, the changes in
the exposures and their putative connection to the incidence
of IA and T1DM in Finland still lack conclusive evidence.
Findingthelargerprotectiveassociationbetweenearlypro-
biotic exposure and IA among children with the DR3/4 geno-
type, when compared with other genotypes, suggests a gene-
environment interaction. The genotype may influence the
interaction of the host immune system with the bacteria
presentintheprobioticsupplement.Anearlierstudy54hasalso
suggested that the HLA genotype may modify the associa-
tion between the timing of dietary exposure and IA.
This is the first time, to our knowledge, that the associa-
tion between probiotic use and T1DM-related IA has been stud-
ied in a longitudinal, observational setting among genetically
high-risk children. Of importance, a protective association be-
tween early probiotic use and T1DM-related IA has been ob-
served.Previousstudies11,12,14haveprovidedevidencethatim-
balance in gut microbiota may be connected with autoimmune
disorders, such as T1DM, and that changes in the microbiota
precede the pathogenic condition. However, studies report-
ing a successful manipulation of gut microbiota by probiotics
in humans are scarce. In any case, influencing the gut micro-
biota with ingested probiotics would be expected to be more
effective very early in life, as we observed.
Conclusions
Early exposure to supplemental probiotics may decrease the
risk of IA among children at elevated risk of T1DM. However,
a randomized clinical trial should confirm the association, and
mechanistic analyses are needed to identify potential envi-
ronmental factors (eg, infections that could mediate the asso-
ciation). These results have to be confirmed before making
recommendations on the use of probiotic supplementation.
