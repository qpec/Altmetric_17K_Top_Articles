Objective.—To provide evidence-based treatment recommendations for adults with acute migraine who require treat-
ment with injectable medication in an emergency department (ED). We addressed two clinically relevant questions: (1)
Which injectable medications should be considered first-line treatment for adults who present to an ED with acute
migraine? (2) Do parenteral corticosteroids prevent recurrence of migraine in adults discharged from an ED?
Methods.—The American Headache Society convened an expert panel of authors who defined a search strategy and
then performed a search of Medline, Embase, the Cochrane database and clinical trial registries from inception through
2015. Identified articles were rated using the American Academy of Neurology’s risk of bias tool. For each medication, the
expert panel determined likelihood of efficacy. Recommendations were created accounting for efficacy, adverse events,
availability of alternate therapies, and principles of medication action.
Results/Conclusions.—The search identified 68 unique randomized controlled trials utilizing 28 injectable medications. Of
these, 19 were rated class 1 (low risk of bias), 21 were rated class 2 (higher risk of bias), and 28 were rated class 3 (highest risk
of bias). Metoclopramide, prochlorperazine, and sumatriptan each had multiple class 1 studies supporting acute efficacy, as did
dexamethasone for prevention of headache recurrence. All other medications had lower levels of evidence.
Recommendations.—Intravenous metoclopramide and prochlorperazine, and subcutaneous sumatriptan should be
offered to eligible adults who present to an ED with acute migraine (Should offer—Level B). Dexamethasone should be
offered to these patients to prevent recurrence of headache (Should offer—Level B). Because of lack of evidence demon-
strating efficacy and concern about sub-acute or long-term sequelae, injectable morphine and hydromorphone are best
avoided as first-line therapy (May avoid–Level C).

INTRODUCTION
Background and Justification.—Acute migraine
causes 1.2 million visits to US emergency depart-
ments (ED) annually.1 More than 20 different paren-
teral medications and combinations of medications
are used to treat migraine in US EDs, including
migraine-specific medications such as sumatriptan
and dihydroergotamine (DHE), anti-dopaminergics,
such
as
metoclopramide
and
the
neuroleptic

 prochlorperazine, opioids, corticosteroids, nonsteroi-
dal anti-inflammatory drugs, and anti-histamines
such as diphenhydramine and promethazine.1,2 The
causes of this heterogeneity in emergency practice
have not been explored systematically but are prob-
ably multifactorial and include physician comfort
and familiarity with specific medications, concern
about short-term side effects, beliefs about efficacy,
and response to patient request. The ideal parenteral
medication would offer rapid and sustained head-
ache freedom, without short or long-term sequelae,
and allow patients to return rapidly to work or usual
daily activities. Unfortunately, such a medication
does not exist. Published clinical trials demonstrate
that fewer than 25% of patients experienced sus-
tained headache freedom after treatment of acute
migraine in the ED.3 Many of the medication classes
listed above have been associated with irreversible
but uncommon side effects such as ischemic vascular
complications with migraine-specific medications,
tardive dyskinesia with anti-dopaminergics, avascular
osteonecrosis with corticosteroids, gastrointestinal
hemorrhage with NSAIDs, and medication depend-
ence with opioids. ED-based clinical trials have only
rarely followed patients for a sufficiently long period
of time. Few of these studies had adequate power to
detect these uncommon downstream sequelae. Given
the very large number of migraineurs presenting to
US EDs annually, the heterogeneity in current emer-
gency practice, and the frequent use of potentially
harmful medications, it is important to know which
parenteral medications should be considered first-line
therapy.
Clinical Question Statement.—The purpose of
this
guideline
is
to
provide
an
evidence-based
answer to each of the following questions.
1. Which injectable medications should be consid-
ered first-line treatment for adults who present
to an ED with acute migraine?
2. Do parenteral corticosteroids prevent recurrence
of migraine in adults discharged from an ED?
METHODS
Authorship Committee.—The American Head-
ache Society (AHS) Guideline Committee deter-
mined the need for a guideline statement on this topic
and assembled a panel of AHS members with the
expertise required to develop this guideline. As per
AHS’s policy, the authorship committee adhered to
the American Academy of Neurology’s Clinical Prac-
tice Guideline Process Manual4 with regard to search-
ing, abstracting, synthesizing, and grading the quality
of the evidence, as well as using the available evi-
dence to construct a guideline statement. The AHS
provided a meeting room for the participants during
its 57th annual national meeting in Washington, DC
(June 18th, 2015). No other material support was pro-
vided. No outside funding was used throughout this
guideline development. The AHS’s guidelines com-
mittee and executive board approved this statement.
Search Strategy.—In consultation with a medical
research librarian, we developed a comprehensive
search strategy to ensure that all relevant evidence
was considered. For the first question, we aimed to
identify all randomized studies of adults with acute
migraine in which an injectable therapeutic was
compared to placebo or to an active control. Stud-
ies were included only if the headache met Interna-
tional Classification of Headache Disorder migraine
criteria.5 Acceptable routes of drug delivery inclu-
ded intravenous, intramuscular, and subcutaneous
injections.
To
qualify
for
inclusion,
the
study
needed to measure acute outcomes, defined as
assessment within 6 hours of medication adminis-
tration. For the second question, we aimed to iden-
tify all randomized studies of adults with acute
migraine in which a corticosteroid medication was
compared to placebo. Again, studies were included
only if the headache met International Classifica-
tion of Headache Disorder migraine criteria.5 To
qualify for inclusion, the study needed to measure
subacute outcomes, defined as an assessment within
1 week of ED discharge. For both questions, we
searched for published studies in the Medline,
Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Con-
trolled Trials databases and looked for additional
unpublished
studies
using
two
registries:
http://
clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO International Clini-
cal
Trial
Registry
Platform.
In
addition,
we
searched references of included studies. Our search
strategy is presented in more detail in Figure S1.

 Study Selection.—We used a two-step process to
select studies. Two authors (S.L.O., S.C.) reviewed
all abstracts identified in the search. Many of these
abstracts were rejected out of hand as not relevant.
At least two authors (S.L.O., B.W.F., S.C.) per-
formed a more detailed review of studies deemed
potentially eligible. Disagreements about whether
or
not
the
study
met
selection
criteria
were
resolved through discussions among three members
(S.L.O., B.W.F., S.C.) of the panel.
Data Abstraction.—Data abstraction was per-
formed by one author and verified by a second
(S.L.O., B.W.F., S.C.). We developed a Characteris-
tics of Study worksheet, which was used for each
included study. On this worksheet, we recorded
information about the study characteristics, setting,
participants, interventions, and outcomes.
Classifying the Evidence–Risk of Bias.—We used
the American Academy of Neurology’s risk of bias
tool to grade study quality (Appendix 1).4 With this
instrument, randomized studies receive the highest
score if they provided a clear description of eligibil-
ity criteria, assessed outcomes in a masked and
objective manner, concealed allocation, used no
more than two primary outcomes, accounted for
discrepancies in baseline characteristics, and if at
least 80% of randomized patients were available
for data analysis. Crossover studies were required
additionally to have a sufficient washout period, no
period effect, and to have used appropriate statis-
tics. Using this instrument, the highest quality
RCTs received a class 1 grade, and the lowest qual-
ity RCTs received a class 3 grade. Nonrandomized
studies were not considered as primary evidence in
this review. At least two authors (S.L.O., B.W.F.,
S.C.)
graded
each
study.
Discrepancies
were
resolved through discussion and, if needed, a third
panel member was consulted to break the tie.
Synthesizing
the
Evidence
(Formulating
Evidence-Based
Conclusions).—For
each
acute
migraine therapeutic, we considered the quality of
the available evidence and the magnitude, preci-
sion, and consistency of results. Studies conducted
in an ED were prioritized over studies conducted
in the clinic or outpatient setting. Meta-analysis
was performed when there were both a sufficient
number of homogeneous studies and uncertainty
with regard to the direction, magnitude, or preci-
sion of results. Sufficient homogeneity required at
least two studies to have used the same medication,
the same comparator, and the same outcome. The
Cochrane Collaborations’ Review Manager 5.3.5
software
(RevMan:
http://tech.cochrane.org/rev-
man) was used to perform the meta-analysis. An
assessment of statistical heterogeneity was per-
formed using the chi square test, in which the
threshold for considering a body of evidence heter-
ogeneous was set at P � .1, and the I-squared test,
where the threshold was set at �30%. This result,
combined with an assessment of clinical heteroge-
neity, was used to determine whether to use a fixed
or random effects model. Event rates and sample
sizes were entered into the RevMan software and
the appropriate Mantel-Haenszel model (fixed or
random effects) was selected to compute odds
ratios and 95% confidence intervals.
For each medication, we came to a conclusion
about certainty of efficacy. Multiple class 1 studies
with a consistent conclusion led to a highly likely to
be effective (or ineffective) conclusion. One class 1
study or multiple class 2 studies resulted in a likely
to be effective (or ineffective) conclusion. Multiple
class 3 or one class 2 study resulted in a possibly
effective (or ineffective) conclusion. Lower levels
of evidence or conflicting evidence resulted in the
following conclusion: there is insufficient evidence
to support or refute efficacy.
Developing Recommendations.—We
attempted
to create a recommendation for every medication
included in the studies identified in our search. We
also attempted to create a recommendation for
every medication used in more than 5% of US ED
migraine visits. To determine whether a medication
was used in more than 5% of US ED migraine vis-
its, we relied on the National Hospital Ambulatory
Medical Care survey, a publically available proba-
bilistic sample published by the National Center for
Health Statistics.6 Recommendations were based
largely on conclusions about the certainty of effi-
cacy (Appendix 2). We weighed certainty of effi-
cacy against frequency and severity of adverse
medication
effects.
Absent
clear
evidence
of
Headache
913
 efficacy (or lack of efficacy), we considered infer-
ences from widely accepted principles about medi-
cation
effects
on
pain
or
the
central
nervous
system. We contextualized rare, but potentially life-
altering, adverse medication effects using published
literature.
RESULTS
Our search identified 2050 studies of which 68
were included in the review (PRISMA flow diagram,
Fig. 1). These 68 studies included 28 different inject-
able medications. Of the 68 studies, 19 were rated
class 1 (low risk of bias), 21 were rated class 2 (higher
risk of bias), and 28 were rated class 3 (highest risk
of bias). Our search for question #2 did not reveal
any eligible studies that did not appear in the search
for question #1 because all eligible corticosteroid
RCTs utilized injectable medication.
Which Injectable Medications Should Be Considered
First-Line Treatment for Adults Who Present to an ED
With Acute Migraine?—Acetaminophen.—We identi-
fied three studies of IV acetaminophen (Table S1).7–9
In one class 1 study, in which 60 patients were random-
ized to acetaminophen 1000 mg or placebo, a compara-
ble number of patients were pain free at 2 hours.8 In
the acetaminophen arm, 4/30 (13%) patients had
minor adverse events.
In a class 2 study, in which 200 patients were
randomized to acetaminophen 1000 mg or dexketo-
profen 50 mg, pain scores were comparable 15 and
30 minutes after medication administration.9 There
were no adverse events in either group.
In a class 3 study of 148 patients, propacetamol
1000 mg, a prodrug of acetaminophen, outper-
formed rizatriptan 5 mg PO at 60 minutes, though
not at 30 or 120 minutes.7 In this study, adverse
events were not reported.
Acetylsalicylic Acid.—We identified four random-
ized studies of intravenous acetylsalicylic acid.10–13
A class 2 study randomized 275 adults to 1 gm ace-
tylsalicylic acid, sumatriptan 6 mg SC or placebo.10
Sumatriptan and acetylsalicylic acid both outper-
formed placebo. Sumatriptan also outperformed
acetylsalicylic acid. However, the latter was toler-
ated as well as placebo, with significantly fewer
adverse events than sumatriptan.
A class 2 study randomized 40 adults to 1 gm
of lysine acetylsalicylic acid or 800 mg of valproic
acid.11 Pain relief at 1 hour and sustained pain free-
dom for 24 hours were comparable between the
groups. No adverse events were reported in either
arm.
Another class 2 study randomized 40 patients
to 500 mg of acetylsalicylic acid or placebo.13 The
active arm demonstrated greater pain relief on a
visual analog scale (VAS). No adverse events were
reported in either group.
In a class 3 study, 56 patients were randomized to
1 gm acetylsalicylic acid or 0.5 mg ergotamine SC.12
Substantially more patients in the acetylsalicylic arm
achieved the primary outcome. These acetylsalicylic
acid patients also tolerated the medication better than
those given ergotamine.
Chlorpromazine.—We identified three randomized
studies of parenteral chlorpromazine.14–16 A class 2
study
randomized
60
adults
to
chlorpromazine
0.1 mg/kg or placebo.14 The chlorpromazine group
reported greater improvements in pain at 30 and 60
minutes than placebo, though patients in the active
group reported more adverse events, most com-
monly orthostatic hypotension and drowsiness.
In a class 3 study, 91 patients were randomized
to chlorpromazine 0.1 mg/kg or metoclopramide
0.1 mg/kg.15 Efficacy and adverse events were com-
parable between the groups.
In another class 3 study, 30 patients were
randomized to chlorpromazine 25 mg IV or ketoro-
lac 60 mg IM.16 At 2 hours, there was no difference
between the groups in pain outcomes. No adverse
events were reported in either group.
Dexamethasone.—We identified four randomized
studies in which dexamethasone was compared to
an active comparator or placebo and acute out-
comes were ascertained.17–20 In a class 1 study, 205
patients were treated with metoclopramide and
diphenhydramine.18 Patients were then randomized
to dexamethasone 10 mg IV or placebo. There was
no difference between the groups in the proportion
of patients achieving pain freedom at 2 hours or in
the frequency of adverse events, though more
patients in the dexamethasone arm developed local-
ized pain reactions.
914
June 2016
 In a class 2 study, 190 patients were random-
ized to dexamethasone 8 mg IV or morphine
0.1 mg/kg IV.20 Patients randomized to morphine
reported lower pain scores at 1 hour, though the
between-group difference was less than standard
thresholds for clinical significance.21 Adverse events
were not reported in this study.
In a class 3 study, 31 patients were randomized
to dexamethasone 16 mg IV or valproic acid 900 mg
IV.17 In this study, there were no differences
between the groups in improvement in pain score.
No adverse events were reported in this study.
In another class 3 study, 90 patients were random-
ized to dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg IV or propofol
10 mg IV, dosed every 5–10 minutes up to 80 mg.19
Patients in the propofol group reported greater
decreases in pain intensity at all time points up to 45
minutes. Patients in the propofol group were very
likely
to
report
sedation.
Oxygen
desaturations
occurred in two patients who received propofol.
Dexketoprofen.—We
identified
two
randomized
studies of dexketoprofen.9,22 In a class 1 study, 224
adults were randomized to dexketoprofen 50 mg IV
or placebo.22 The active group had substantially
greater improvement in pain intensity at 30 and 45
minutes. No adverse events were reported.
In a class 2 study, 200 adults were randomized to
dexketoprofen
50
mg
or
acetaminophen
1
gm.9

Headache
915
 Fifteen and 30 minutes after medication administra-
tion, there were no differences in pain scores. No
adverse events were reported in either group.
Diclofenac.—We identified three randomized stud-
ies of diclofenac.23–25 A class 3 study randomized
120 patients to diclofenac 75 mg IM or placebo.23
At 1 hour, the diclofenac patients had greater rates
of headache relief than placebo. Adverse events
were not reported.
Another class 3 study randomized 47 patients
to diclofenac 75 mg IM or tramadol 100 mg IM.24
There were no between-group differences in any
outcomes. Adverse events were uncommon.
A third class 3 study randomized 34 adults to
diclofenac 75 mg IM or DHE 1 mg IM.25 All
patients received metoclopramide 10 mg IV. Out-
comes at 1 and 2 hours were mixed. Adverse events
were not reported.
Dihydroergotamine.—We identified two random-
ized studies of DHE.25,26 In a class 3 study, 310
patients were randomized to DHE 1 mg SC or
sumatriptan 6 mg SC. Outcomes favored sumatrip-
tan at 1 and 2 hours though not at 3 hours. There
were 305 adverse events reported among the 152
patients
who
received
DHE
and
238
adverse
events
among
the
158
patients
who
received
sumatriptan.
In
another
class
3
study,
34
adults
were
randomized to DHE 1 mg IM or diclofenac 75 mg
IM. All patients received metoclopramide 10 mg
IV. Outcomes at 1 and 2 hours were mixed.
Adverse events were not reported.
Diphenhydramine.—We
identified
one
study
of
diphenhydramine for migraine.27 In a class 1 study,
there were no differences in outcomes or adverse
events among 208 adults randomized to diphen-
hydramine 50 mg IV or placebo. All patients
received metoclopramide 10 mg IV. A discussion of
the efficacy of diphenhydramine to prevent extra-
pyramidal symptoms is beyond the scope of this
review. However, in this class 1 study, in which all
patients
were
administered
IV
metoclopramide,
there was no difference in the rate of extra-
pyramidal symptoms between those who received
diphenhydramine and those who did not.
Dipyrone.—We identified two randomized studies
of dipyrone for migraine.28,29 In a class 2 study, 134
adults were randomized to intravenous dipyrone 1
gm or placebo.29 The active arm had greater head-
ache relief at 30 and 60 minutes. There was no dif-
ference in the overall rate of adverse events.
In
another
class
2
study,
27
adults
were
randomized
to
dipyrone
or
metoclopramide.28
There was no difference in pain intensity at 2
hours. No significant adverse events were reported.
Droperidol.—We identified two randomized studies
of droperidol.30,31 In a class 2 study, 305 patients
were randomized to placebo or to doses of IM dro-
peridol ranging from 0.1 to 8.25 mg.30 Doses of dro-
peridol from 2.75 to 8.25 mg outperformed placebo
with regard to headache response at 2 hours.
Adverse events were greater among those who
received the active medication.
In a class 3 study, 29 adults were randomized
to droperidol 2.5 mg IM or meperidine 1.5 mg/kg
IM.31 There were no between group differences in
efficacy. Akathisia occurred in 13% of those who
received droperidol. Sedation occurred in 7% of
the droperidol arm.
Ergotamine.—We identified one class 3 study of
ergotamine, in which ergotamine 0.5 mg SC was
compared with 1 gm of IV acetylsalicylic acid.12
More patients in the acetylsalicylic acid group
achieved a 50% pain reduction while more patients
in
the
ergotamine
group
reported
nausea
and
vomiting.
Haloperidol.—We identified two randomized stud-
ies of haloperidol.32,33 In a class 1 study, 64 patients
were randomized to haloperidol 5 mg IV or meto-
clopramide 10 mg IV.32 All patients also received
diphenhydramine 25 mg IV. There were no statisti-
cally significant differences in change in pain inten-
sity, the primary outcome, though use of rescue
medication was less common in the haloperidol
group. Side effects were comparable between the
two arms.
In a class 3 study, 40 adults were randomized
to haloperidol 5 mg IV or placebo.33 Substantially
more participants in the haloperidol group reported
marked relief, though 80% of the haloperidol group
916
June 2016
 reported side effects including 53% with motor
agitation.
Ketamine.—We identified one class 3 crossover
study of ketamine in which 17 adults were random-
ized to ketamine 0.08 mg/kg or placebo.34 Patients
who received ketamine reported significantly larger
decreases
in
pain
intensity,
though
feelings
of
fatigue or insobriety were common.
Ketorolac.—We identified four randomized studies
of ketorolac.16,35–37 In a class 1 study, 330 patients
were randomized to ketorolac 30 mg IV, metoclo-
pramide 10 mg IV, or valproate 1 gm IV.36 Ketoro-
lac and metoclopramide demonstrated similar rates
of headache relief at 1 and 48 hour sustained relief,
and both were superior to valproic acid. Overall
adverse event rates were comparable.
In a class 3 study, 47 patients during 50 ED vis-
its were randomized to ketorolac 60 mg IM or
meperidine
100
mg 1 hydroxyzine
50
mg
IM.35
There were no significant differences between the
groups with regard to efficacy or adverse events.
A second class 3 study randomized 31 patients
to ketorolac 30 mg IM or meperidine 75 mg IM.37
The ketorolac group experienced significantly less
pain reduction at 1 hour than the meperidine
group. Adverse events were comparable.
In a third class 3 study, 30 patients were
randomized to ketorolac 60 mg IM or chlorproma-
zine 25 mg IV.16 Results at 2 hours were compara-
ble. Adverse events were not reported.
Lidocaine.—In a class 2 study, 25 patients were
randomized to lidocaine 1 mg/kg or normal saline.38
There were no differences in efficacy between
groups. No adverse events were reported.
Lysine Clonixinate.—In a class 3 study, 29 patients
were randomized to IV lysine clonixinate or pla-
cebo.39 Lysine clonixinate had higher rates of head-
ache freedom at 60 and 90 minutes, though adverse
events were more common in this group as well.
Magnesium.—We identified five randomized studies
of magnesium.40–44 In a class 1 study, 44 patients
were randomized to magnesium 2 gm IV or pla-
cebo.42 All patients also received metoclopramide
20 mg IV. There was no statistically significant dif-
ference
in
the
primary
outcome,
which
was
improvement on a VAS between baseline and ED
discharge, though more patients randomized to pla-
cebo improved by �50% on the VAS and more
placebo patients reported normal functionality at
the time of ED discharge. Adverse events were
more common in the magnesium arm.
In a class 2 study, 70 patients were randomized
to
magnesium
1
gm
IV
or
dexamethasone
8
mg1 metoclopramide 10 mg IV.44 Patients random-
ized to magnesium reported greater decreases in pain
intensity at 20 minutes, 1 hour, and 2 hours as com-
pared
to
dexamethasone1 metoclopramide.
There
was no difference in the frequency of adverse events.
In another class 2 study, 60 patients were
randomized to magnesium 1 gm or placebo.40 Mag-
nesium demonstrated greater headache relief and
headache freedom at 30 and 60 minutes among
those patients with migraine with aura, though not
among those without aura. Adverse events were
not reported.
In a class 3 study, 30 patients were randomized
to magnesium 2 gm IV or placebo.43 Nearly every
magnesium patient reported improvement vs none
in the placebo group. Flushing was more common
among those who received magnesium.
In another class 3 study, 113 patients were
randomized to magnesium 2 gm IV, metoclopra-
mide 10 mg IV, or placebo.41 There were no statis-
tically significant differences between groups with
regard to pain intensity at 30 minutes. Flushing was
more common in the magnesium group.
Meperidine.—We identified three randomized stud-
ies of meperidine.31,35,37 In a class 3 study, 47
patients (during 50 visits) were randomized to
meperidine 100 mg 1 hydroxyzine 50 mg IM or
ketorolac 60 mg IM.35 There were no significant
differences between groups in the frequency of
headache relief or side effects.
In
another
class
3
study,
31
adults
were
randomized to meperidine 75 mg IM or ketorolac
30 mg IM.37 Those randomized to meperidine
reported greater pain relief. Adverse events were
comparable.
In a class 3 study, 29 patients were randomized
to meperidine 1.5 mg/kg IM or droperidol 2.5 mg
IM.31 Efficacy results were comparable as was
drowsiness.
Headache
917
 Metoclopramide.—We
identified
8
randomized
studies of metoclopramide.15,28,32,36,41,45–47 In a class
1 study, 64 patients were randomized to metoclo-
pramide 10 mg IV or haloperidol 5 mg IV.32 All
patients were also treated with diphenhydramine
25 mg IV. There was no statistically significant dif-
ference in pain relief at 80 minutes. Patients in the
haloperidol arm required rescue medication less
frequently. The frequency of adverse events was
comparable.
In another class 1 study, 330 patients were
randomized to metoclopramide 10 mg IV, ketorolac
30 mg IV, or valproate 1 gm IV.36 Metoclopramide
and ketorolac demonstrated similar rates of head-
ache relief at 1 and 48 hour sustained relief, and
both were superior to valproic acid. Overall adverse
event rates were comparable.
In a third class 1 study, 77 adults were randomized
to metoclopramide 20 mg IV or prochlorperazine
10 mg IV.47 All patients received diphenhydramine
25 mg IV. There was no difference between the groups
in improvement in pain intensity at 1 hour. Adverse
event rates were comparable between the groups.
In the fourth class 1 study, 78 patients were
randomized to metoclopramide, which was dosed in
successive 20 mg doses up to 80 mg, as needed for
persistent pain, or to sumatriptan 6 mg SC.45 Patients
who received metoclopramide were also treated with
IV
diphenhydramine.
There
was
no
difference
between the groups in reduction in pain intensity,
though secondary outcomes including pain freedom
at 2 hours and requirement of rescue medication
favored
metoclopramide.
Adverse
events
were
comparable.
In a class 2 study, 27 adults were randomized
to metoclopramide or dipyrone.28 There were no
differences in pain intensity at 2 hours. No signifi-
cant adverse events were reported.
In a class 3 study, 91 patients were randomized
to metoclopramide 0.1 mg/kg or chlorpromazine
0.1 mg/kg.15 Efficacy and adverse events were com-
parable between the groups.
In a class 3 study, 113 patients were random-
ized to metoclopramide 10 mg IV, magnesium 2 gm
IV, or placebo.41 There were no statistically signifi-
cant differences between groups with regard to pain
intensity at 30 minutes. Flushing was more common
in the magnesium group.
In a class 3 study, 124 patients were random-
ized to metoclopramide 20 mg IV or sumatriptan
6 mg SC.46 The metoclopramide group demon-
strated greater reduction in pain at 1 hour. Adverse
events were not reported.
Morphine.—In a class 2 study, 190 patients were
randomized to morphine 0.1 mg/kg IV or dexa-
methasone 8 mg IV.20 Patients randomized to mor-
phine reported lower pain scores at 1 hour, though
the between-group difference was less than stand-
ard thresholds for clinical significance.21 Adverse
events were not reported in this study.
Octreotide.—We identified 3 randomized studies of
octreotide.48–50 In a class 1 crossover study, 43
patients were randomized to octreotide 0.1 mg SC
or placebo.49 There was no difference between the
groups with regard to headache relief at 2 hours.
Adverse events were comparable.
In a class 2 study, 29 patients were randomized
to octreotide 0.1 mg SC or placebo.48 The octreo-
tide group had greater reduction in pain at 2 and 6
hours. Local reactions were more common in the
octreotide group.
In another class 2 study, 44 patients were
randomized to octreotide 0.1 mg IV or prochlorper-
azine 10 mg IV.50 Prochlorperazine was superior
with regard to patient satisfaction and reduction in
pain intensity. Sedation and akathisia were more
common with prochlorperazine.
Prochlorperazine.—We identified four randomized
studies of prochlorperazine.47,50–52 In a class 1
study, 66 patients were randomized to prochlorper-
azine 10 mg 1 diphenhydramine 12.5 mg IV or
sumatriptan 6 mg SC.51 There was a significantly
greater decrease in pain intensity at 80 minutes in
the prochlorperazine group. Restlessness was more
common in the prochlorperazine group.
In a class 1 study, 77 adults were randomized
to prochlorperazine 10 mg IV or metoclopramide
20 mg IV.47 All patients received diphenhydramine
25 mg IV. There was no difference between the
groups in change in pain intensity at 1 hour.
Adverse event rates were comparable between the
groups.

 In a class 2 study, 44 patients were randomized
to prochlorperazine 10 mg IV or octreotide 0.1 mg
IV.50 Prochlorperazine was superior with regard to
patient satisfaction and reduction in pain intensity.
Sedation and akathisia were more common with
prochlorperazine.
In a class 3 study, 40 patients were randomized
to prochlorperazine 10 mg IV or valproic acid
500 mg IV.52 The prochlorperazine patients had a
significantly greater decrease in pain intensity at 60
minutes. In the prochlorperazine group, 10% of
patients were treated for akathisia.
Propofol.—We identified two randomized studies
of propofol.19,53 In a class 2 study, 90 patients were
randomized to propofol IV or sumatriptan 6 mg
SC.53 The propofol was administered in 30–40 mg
boluses with subsequent 10–20 mg boluses every 3–
5 minutes up to 120 mg. At 30 minutes, there was a
statistically significantly greater decrease in pain
intensity in the propofol group. Chest tightness was
less common in the propofol group.
In a class 3 study, 90 patients were randomized
to propofol 10 mg IV, dosed every 5–10 minutes up
to 80 mg or dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg IV.19
Patients in the propofol group reported greater
decreases in pain intensity at all time points up to
45 minutes. Patients in the propofol group were
very likely to report sedation. Oxygen desaturation
occurred in 2 patients who received propofol.
Sumatriptan.—We identified 23 randomized trials
of subcutaneous sumatriptan.10,26,45,46,51,53–70 Fifteen
placebo controlled studies revealed large and con-
sistent statistically significant differences between
sumatriptan and placebo in four class 1 stud-
ies,64,66,68,70 seven class 2 studies,54,56,58,60,61,63,67 and
four class 3 studies.55,57,62,65
In a class 1 study, 66 patients were randomized
to
sumatriptan
6
mg
SC
or
prochlorperazine
10 mg 1 diphenhydramine 12.5 mg IV.51 There was a
significantly greater decrease in pain intensity at 80
minutes in the prochlorperazine group. Restlessness
was more common in the prochlorperazine group.
In another class 1 study, 78 patients were
randomized to sumatriptan 6 mg SC or metoclopra-
mide, which was dosed in successive 20 mg doses
up to 80 mg, as needed for persistent pain.45
Patients who received metoclopramide were also
treated with IV diphenhydramine. There was no
difference between the groups in reduction in pain
intensity,
though
secondary
outcomes
including
pain freedom at 2 hours and requirement of rescue
medication
favored
metoclopramide.
Adverse
events were comparable.
In a third class 1 study, 40 patients were
randomized to sumatriptan 6 mg SC or trimetho-
benzamide 200 mg IM 1 diphenhydramine 25 mg
IM.59 Though there were no statistically significant
differences between groups, the study was under-
powered and most results favored sumatriptan. The
overall rate of adverse events was comparable.
A class 2 study randomized 275 adults to suma-
triptan 6 mg SC, 1 gm acetylsalicylic acid, or pla-
cebo.10 Sumatriptan and acetylsalicylic acid both
outperformed placebo, while sumatriptan outper-
formed acetylsalicylic acid. However, the latter was
tolerated as well as placebo, with significantly fewer
adverse events than sumatriptan.
In another class 2 study, 90 patients were random-
ized to sumatriptan 6 mg SC or propofol IV.53 The
propofol was administered in 30–40 mg boluses with
subsequent 10–20 mg boluses every 3–5 minutes up to
120 mg. At 30 minutes, there was a greater decrease
in pain intensity in the propofol group. Chest tightness
was less common in the propofol group.
A class 2 crossover
study
randomized
266
patients to sumatriptan 6 mg SC or to DHE 1 mg
nasal spray.69 The sumatriptan group had signifi-
cantly better pain relief beginning at 15 minutes,
though there were 50% fewer adverse events in the
DHE group.
In a class 3 study, 124 patients were random-
ized to sumatriptan 6 mg SC or metoclopramide
20 mg IV.46 The metoclopramide group demon-
strated greater reduction in pain at 1 hour. Adverse
events were not reported.
In another class 3 study, 310 patients were
randomized to sumatriptan 6 mg SC or DHE 1 mg
SC.26 Outcomes favored sumatriptan at 1 and 2
hours though not at 3 hours. There were 305
adverse events reported among the 152 patients
who received DHE and 238 adverse events among
the 158 patients who received sumatriptan.
Headache
919
 Tramadol.—A class 3 study randomized 47 patients
to tramadol 100 mg IM or diclofenac 75 mg IM.24
There were no between-group differences in any
outcomes. Adverse events were uncommon.
Triamcinolone.—In a class 3 study of greater occipi-
tal nerve blocks, 37 patients were randomized to
subcutaneous injections of lidocaine, bupivacaine,
and 40 mg of triamcinolone or the two local anes-
thetics and saline.71 Twenty minutes after the injec-
tion, there were no differences in pain scores
between
the
groups.
No
adverse
events
were
reported.
Trimethobenzamide.—In a class 1 study, 40 patients
were randomized to trimethobenzamide 200 mg
IM 1 diphenhydramine 25 mg IM or to sumatriptan
6 mg SC.59 Although there were no statistically sig-
nificant differences between groups, the study was
underpowered and most results favored sumatrip-
tan. In this study, there was no difference in the
overall rate of adverse events.
Valproic
Acid.—We
identified
four
randomized
studies of valproic acid.11,17,36 In a class 1 study,
330 patients were randomized to valproate 1 gm
IV, ketorolac 30 mg IV, or metoclopramide 10 mg
IV.36 Ketorolac and metoclopramide demonstrated
similar efficacy with regard to headache relief at 1
hour and sustained headache relief for 48 hours,
and both were superior to valproic acid. Overall
adverse event rates were comparable.
A class 2 study randomized 40 adults to 1 gm of
lysine acetylsalicylic acid or 800 mg of valproic
acid.11 Rates of pain relief at 1 and 24 hour sustained
pain freedom were comparable between the groups.
No adverse events were reported in either arm.
In a class 3 study, 40 patients were randomized
to valproic acid 500 mg IV or prochlorperazine
10 mg IV.52 The prochlorperazine patients had a
significantly greater decrease in pain intensity at 60
minutes. In the prochlorperazine group, 10% of
patients were treated for akathisia.
In another class 3 study, 31 patients were
randomized to valproic acid 900 mg IV or dexameth-
asone 16 mg IV.17 In this study, there was no
difference between the groups in improvement in
pain score. No adverse events were reported in this
study.
Other
Medications.—Hydromorphone,
prometha-
zine, and nalbuphine are each used in more than
5% of ED migraine visits annually.1 However,
these medications were not included in any clinical
trials that fulfilled our selection criteria.
Do Parenteral Corticosteroids Prevent Recurrence
of Migraine in Adults Discharged from an ED?—We
identified three eligible RCTs in which a corticoste-
roid was compared to placebo and post-ED out-
comes were ascertained (Table S1).18,72,73 All three
of these studies utilized dexamethasone. Two addi-
tional RCTs compared dexamethasone to active
comparators. In one, dexamethasone was compared
to morphine 0.1 mg/kg IV20; in the other to val-
proic acid 900 mg IV.17
In a class 1 study involving 115 patients, dexa-
methasone 24 mg IV did not outperform placebo
with regard to migraine recurrence at 3 or 30
days.72 In this study, dizziness was more common
among
those
who
received
dexamethasone.
In
another class 1 study involving 205 patients, all
patients received metoclopramide and diphenhydr-
amine.18 One hundred and six of these patients also
received dexamethasone 10 mg IV. There were no
between-group differences in the rates of sustained
headache freedom 24 hours after ED discharge.
Acute medication reactions were more common in
the dexamethasone group. In a third class 1 study
of 70 patients, dexamethasone 10 mg IV did not
outperform placebo with regard to migraine recur-
rence within 48 hours of ED discharge.73 Adverse
events were not reported.
We performed a meta-analysis in which we
aggregated data from these three placebo con-
trolled studies. These results are presented in Fig-
ure 2. In the Friedman et al study, the primary
outcome was sustained headache freedom. For the
purpose of this meta-analysis, we used data pro-
vided by the authors on frequency of headache
recurrence after ED discharge. When the data from
these three studies were aggregated, dexametha-
sone decreased the frequency of headache recur-
rence after ED discharge (number needed to treat:
9, 95%CI: 5, 65). As can be seen in Figure 2, there
was no statistical heterogeneity among the studies.
All three studies reported a small but consistent
920
June 2016
 benefit attributable to dexamethasone. When aggre-
gated, this result was statistically significant.
The comparison with morphine was a class 2
study, in which dexamethasone 8 mg IV demon-
strated greater improvement in pain scores at 24
hours.20 Adverse events were not reported. The
comparison with valproic acid was a class 3 study,
in which dexamethasone 16 mg IV resulted in com-
parable headache recurrence rates at 72 hours.17
This study, too, did not report adverse events.
There were no reports in these studies of avas-
cular necrosis, a serious adverse event linked to
corticosteroid
use,
infections,
or
complications
relating to loss of glycemic control. However, none
of these studies were designed to detect these
adverse events.
LIMITATIONS
A multitude of different methodologies were
used in the studies included in this review. While
the inclusion criteria were generally similar, some
studies used placebo control and some used active
control, some were dose-finding studies, and some
used multiple active comparators. Different time
points were used for the primary outcome, and dif-
ferent outcomes were designated as being primary
or secondary. We did not identify a single outcome
that was used across all studies included in this
review. Some of these studies, particularly those
utilizing sumatriptan, were conducted outside of the
ED setting. While these disparities do not mean
that the studies included in this review were unduly
biased, the disparities limited our ability to aggre-
gate data and compare results across studies. A
standardized methodology for ED-based migraine
studies is needed.
Furthermore,
most
studies
included
in
this
review did not follow patients beyond the initial
treatment period. Thus, recurrence of headache
after ED discharge and late developing adverse
events often went unrecorded. Long-term follow-up
beyond 48–72 hours was even rarer among the
included studies, thus limiting our ability to com-
ment on these.
While many studies were adequately powered
for their primary outcome, they were underpow-
ered for rare adverse events such as tardive dyski-
nesia or avascular necrosis. This also limits our
ability to contextualize these important adverse
effects with regard to frequency and severity.
CONCLUSIONS
We have identified 68 RCTs that inform the
choice of injectable medical treatment of adults
presenting to the ED with migraine. Five of these
trials also provided evidence pertaining to the use
of corticosteroids for the prevention of migraine
recurrence after ED discharge. Analysis of these 68
trials provided the basis for our recommendations,
listed below.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Putting
the
Evidence
Into
a
Clinical
Context.—When asked, migraine patients report
that they want medications that take their pain
away quickly and completely, without side effects
and without headache recurrence.74 However, ED
migraine patients are often satisfied with modest
reductions in pain.3 While the former goal is ideal,

online issue, which is available at wileyonlinelibrary.com.)
Headache
921
 and should be the ultimate goal, the latter is a
more likely outcome of ED treatment. It is impossi-
ble to expect that these recommendations will pro-
vide
the
correct
therapeutic
answer
for
every
migraine patient during every ED visit. Other fac-
tors, most importantly a patient’s previous experi-
ence with a particular medication, and risk of
adverse events, should be considered. The following
recommendations
are
most
appropriate
for
a
patient
who
has
never
received
an
injectable
migraine therapeutic in the ED (Table 1).
Acute Management of Migraine.
Must Offer (Level A).—None
Should Offer (Level B).—To relieve the acute
headache, intravenous metoclopramide should be
offered to adults who present to an ED with acute
migraine (Should offer–Level B). Patients should
be warned about the possibility of unpleasant side
effects including akathisia and drowsiness (Table
2). Irreversible adverse events have never been
reported
after
one
dose
of
intravenous
metoclopramide.
To relieve the acute headache, intravenous pro-
chlorperazine should be offered to adults who
present to an ED with acute migraine (Should
offer–Level B). Patients should be warned about
the possibility of unpleasant side effects including
akathisia and drowsiness (Table 2).
To relieve the acute headache, subcutaneous
sumatriptan should be offered to adults who present
to an ED with acute migraine (Should offer–Level
B). In the ED, sumatriptan may be less efficacious
than intravenous anti-dopaminergics. Sumatriptan is
not appropriate for patients with contra-indications
to this medication and should not be offered to those
who have used ergotamine, DHE, or a triptan medi-
cation within the previous 24 hours. Unpleasant side
effects have occurred in 50% of ED patients admin-
istered this medication (Table 2),54 though irre-
versible
adverse
events
in
patients
with
low
cardiovascular risk are exceedingly uncommon.
May Offer and May Avoid (Level C).
OFFER. Intravenous
acetaminophen
may
be
offered to adults who present to an ED with acute
migraine (May offer–Level C).
Intravenous acetylsalicylic acid may be offered
to adults who present to an ED with acute migraine
(May offer–Level C).
Parenteral chlorpromazine may be offered to
adults who present to an ED with acute migraine
(May offer–Level C). Patients should be warned
about the possibility of unpleasant side effects
including orthostatic hypotension, drowsiness, and
akathisia.
Intravenous dexketoprofen may be offered to
adults who present to an ED with acute migraine
(May offer–Level C).
Intravenous diclofenac may be offered to adults
who present to an ED with acute migraine (May
offer–Level C).
Intravenous dipyrone may be offered to adults
who present to an ED with acute migraine (May
offer–Level C), an exceedingly rare but life threat-
ening adverse event associated with dipyrone, has
resulted in elimination of this medication from the
United States and other countries.
Parenteral droperidol may be offered to adults
who present to an ED with acute migraine (May
offer–Level C). Patients should be warned about the
possibility of unpleasant side effects including drows-
iness and akathisia, which may occur in 50% of
patients. Life threatening cardiac dysrhythmias occur
exceedingly
rarely
after
administration
of
this
medication.
Parenteral haloperidol may be offered to adults
who present to an ED with acute migraine (May
offer–Level C). Patients should be warned about
the possibility of unpleasant side effects including
drowsiness, and akathisia.
Intravenous ketorolac may be offered to adults
who present to an ED with acute migraine (May
offer–Level C).
Intravenous valproate may be offered to adults
who present to an ED with acute migraine (May
offer–Level C).
AVOID.
Intravenous
diphenhydramine
may
be AVOIDED in adults who present to an ED
with acute migraine (May avoid–Level C). The effi-
cacy of diphenhydramine with regard to treatment
of akathisia was beyond the scope of this work.

acute migraine (May avoid–Level C).
Intravenous lidocaine may be AVOIDED in
adults who present to an ED with acute migraine
(May avoid–Level C).
Intravenous morphine may be AVOIDED in
adults who present to an ED with acute migraine
(May avoid–Level C).
Intravenous octreotide may be AVOIDED in

No Recommendation (Level U).—No recommenda-
tion can be made regarding the role of parenteral
dexamethasone for acute migraine relief in adults
who present to an ED with acute migraine (No rec-
ommendation–Level U). Please see below for our
recommendation regarding dexamethasone for pre-
vention of migraine recurrence.
No recommendation can be made regarding the
role of injectable dihydroergotamine for adults who
present to an ED with acute migraine (No recom-
mendation–Level U).
No recommendation can be made regarding the role
of injectable ergotamine for adults who present to an ED
with acute migraine (No recommendation–Level U).
No recommendation can be made regarding the
role of injectable ketamine for adults who present
to an ED with acute migraine (No recommenda-
tion–Level U).
No recommendation can be made regarding the
role of injectable lysine clonixinate for adults who
present to an ED with acute migraine (No recom-
mendation–Level U).
No recommendation can be made regarding the
role of intravenous magnesium for adults who pres-
ent to an ED with acute migraine (No recommen-
dation–Level U). However, intravenous magnesium
may be of benefit to patients who present with
migraine with aura.
No recommendation can be made regarding the
role of intravenous meperidine for adults who pres-
ent to an ED with acute migraine (No recommen-
dation–Level U).
No recommendation can be made regarding the
role of intravenous nalbuphine for adults who pres-
ent to an ED with acute migraine (No recommen-
dation–Level U).
No recommendation can be made regarding the
role of intravenous propofol for adults who present
to an ED with acute migraine (No recommenda-
tion–Level U).
No recommendation can be made regarding the
role of parenteral promethazine for adults who
present to an emergency department with acute
migraine (No recommendation–Level U).
No recommendation can be made regarding the
role of intravenous tramadol for adults who present
to an ED with acute migraine (No recommenda-
tion–Level U).
No recommendation can be made regarding the
role of intramuscular trimethobenzamide for adults
who present to an ED with acute migraine (No rec-
ommendation–Level U).
Prevention of Migraine Recurrence.
Must Offer (Level A).—None
Should Offer (Level B).—Parenteral dexametha-
sone should be offered to adults who present to an
ED with acute migraine (Should offer–Level B).
The ideal dose of dexamethasone is not known.
The three studies included in this review used one
administration of dexamethasone, which was 10 mg
in one study, 20 mg in the second, and 24 mg in the
third. Before prescribing dexamethasone, clinicians
should consider an individual patient’s risk for
treatment-related adverse events (Table 2), such as
loss of glycemic control in diabetics. Risk of irre-
versible adverse events such as avascular necrosis
after one dose of dexamethasone is exceedingly low
and should not dissuade clinicians from administer-
ing this medication.
May Offer (Level C).—None
Recommendations for Future Research.—In our
systematic review, we identified 68 randomized tri-
als using widely varying methodologies. Inclusion
criteria,
comparators,
measurement
instruments,
duration of follow-up, and ascertainment of adverse
events was often different from study to study mak-
ing it difficult to compare data across studies. A
number of randomized studies were excluded from
this systematic review for failure to incorporate
international migraine criteria into their selection
Headache
935
 criteria.
As
a
first
recommendation
for
future
research, we support the development of a standard
methodology
for
ED-based
headache
research.
Patient priorities must be understood. Patient prior-
ities can then be used to guide the development of
standardized instruments and follow-up time points.
While many patients are satisfied with the
headache relief they obtain in the ED,3 inadequate
relief, adverse medication events, and recurrence of
headache after ED discharge are very common.
Using a standardized methodology, we hope that
ED-based researchers continue to conduct and pub-
lish randomized trials of migraine therapeutics to
optimize the injectable treatment that migraine
patients receive in the ED.
