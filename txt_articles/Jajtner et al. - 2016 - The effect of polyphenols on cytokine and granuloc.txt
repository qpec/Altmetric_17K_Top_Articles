Abstract
This study examined the effect of resistance exercise on the production,
recruitment, percentage, and adhesion characteristics of granulocytes with
and without polyphenol (PPB) supplementation. Thirty-eight untrained men
were
randomized
into
three
groups:
PPB
(n = 13,
21.8 � 2.5
years, 171.2 � 5.5 cm, 71.2 � 8.2 kg), placebo (PL; n = 15, 21.6 � 2.5 years,
176.5 � 4.9 cm, 84.0 � 15.7 kg), or control (CON; n = 10, 23.3 � 4.3 years,
173.7 � 12.6 cm, 77.3 � 16.3 kg). Blood samples were obtained pre (PRE),
immediately (IP), 1 h (1H), 5 h (5H), 24 h (24H), 48 h (48H), and 96 h
(96H) postresistance exercise (PPB/PL) or rest (CON). Fine-needle biopsies
were obtained from the vastus lateralis at PRE, 1H, 5H, and 48H. Plasma
concentrations and intramuscular content of interleukin-8 (IL-8), granulocyte
(G-CSF), and granulocyte–macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF)
were analyzed via multiplex assays. Changes in relative number of circulating
granulocytes and adhesion receptor (CD11b) were assessed using flow cytome-
try. Intramuscular IL-8 was significantly elevated at 1H, 5H, and 48H
(P < 0.001). Area under the curve analysis indicated a greater intramuscular
IL-8 content in PL than PPB (P = 0.011). Across groups, circulating G-CSF
was
elevated
from
PRE
at
IP
(P < 0.001),
1H
(P = 0.011),
and
5H
(P = 0.025),
while
GM-CSF
was
elevated
at
IP
(P < 0.001)
and
1H
(P = 0.007). Relative number of granulocytes was elevated at 1H (P < 0.001),
5H (P < 0.001), and 24H (P = 0.005, P = 0.006) in PPB and PL, respectively.
Across groups, granulocyte CD11b expression was upregulated from PRE to
IP (P < 0.001) and 1H (P = 0.015). Results indicated an increase in circulat-
ing CD11b on granulocytes, and IL-8 within the muscle following intense
resistance exercise. Polyphenol supplementation may attenuate the IL-8
response, however, did not affect granulocyte percentage and adhesion mole-
cule expression in peripheral blood following resistance exercise.
Introduction
Resistance exercise performed at a sufficient intensity will
result in microtrauma to skeletal muscle, which may be
reflected by leakage of various biomarkers (e.g., creatine
kinase, CK) and/or myoglobin), increases in muscle
soreness, and potential decreases in muscle performance
(Clarkson and Hubal 2002; Paulsen et al. 2005). The
mechanical stress associated with a resistance exercise
stimulus and the resulting tissue damage signals a pro-
found nonspecific immune response (Tidball and Villalta
2010;
Freidenreich
and
Volek
2012).
This
response

 manifests itself through increases in cytokine and chemo-
kine production from skeletal muscle tissue, endothelial
cells, resident macrophages, and other circulating immune
cells (Nieman et al. 2004; Della Gatta et al. 2014). Once
released, cytokines and chemokines will elicit a response
from the immune system, resulting in an accumulation of
myeloid cells within a few hours, which persist for several
days (Paulsen et al. 2010).
The infiltration of damaged tissue consists of three
phases: preliminary, early, and late, with each phase elicit-
ing specific actions within the recovery process (Tidball
and Villalta 2010). The preliminary phase promotes an
inflammatory environment (Nguyen and Tidball 2003;
Pizza et al. 2005) primarily consisting of neutrophils, the
most abundant granulocyte (Parkin and Cohen 2001).
Granulocytes, which include neutrophils, eosinophils, and
basophils, are produced within the bone marrow as a result
of stimulation by granulocyte colony stimulating factor
(G-CSF) (Roberts 2005), while granulocyte–macrophage
colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-8
(IL-8) function to activate and recruit granulocytes to the
site of tissue damage (Hammond et al. 1995; Francisco-
Cruz et al. 2014). Following the preliminary phase, the
early and late phases are characterized by macrophages that
promote inflammation (M1) and recovery (M2), respec-
tively (Tidball and Villalta 2010).
Changes in neutrophil counts (Peake et al. 2005b) and
cellular activation (Pizza et al. 1996; Saxton et al. 2003)
are observed following exercise. Macrophage-1 antigen
(MAC1), also referred to as complement receptor 3
(CR3) is a b2 integrin composed of CD11b and CD18,
and facilitates the late phases of transendothelial migra-
tion of immune cells following tissue damage (Tan 2012).
Investigations examining the expression of CD11b/CD18
on neutrophils in response to exercise have utilized vari-
ous modes of exercise (Pizza et al. 1996; van Eeden et al.
1999; Saxton et al. 2003) and have yielded equivocal
results (Pizza et al. 1996; Saxton et al. 2003; Peake et al.
2005b). To our knowledge, no investigations have exam-
ined the neutrophil CD11b/CD18 response following a
dynamic resistance exercise bout.
As resistance exercise appears to elicit significant eleva-
tions in markers of oxidative stress (Merry and Ristow
2015), antioxidant supplementation has been examined as
a
potential
countermeasure
to
reduce
the
oxidative
response to resistance exercise (Panza et al. 2008; Jowko
et al. 2011; Paulsen et al. 2014). Specifically, polyphenol
supplementation has been demonstrated to reduce force
deficits and markers of muscle damage in response to
resistance exercise (Panza et al. 2008; Jowko et al. 2011),
while others have demonstrated equivocal results (Paulsen
et al. 2014). Although supplementation with antioxidants
(vitamins A, C, and E) appear to blunt the response of
the proinflammatory cytokines following endurance exer-
cise (Vassilakopoulos et al. 2003), the benefits of polyphe-
nol
supplementation
in
conjunction
with
eccentric
exercise have been ambiguous (Kerksick et al. 2010;
O’Fallon et al. 2012; Herrlinger et al. 2015). Decreases in
circulating neutrophil counts have been observed follow-
ing eccentric exercise in conjunction with epigallocatechin
gallate (EGCG) supplementation (Kerksick et al. 2010),
though the fate of these cells is unknown. As polyphenol
incubation results in reduced expression of adhesion
molecules on neutrophils, along with limited chemotaxis
in vitro (Kawai et al. 2004; Takano et al. 2004), decreased
neutrophil concentrations following exercise are not likely
explained by increased infiltration. To the best of our
knowledge, the specific response of neutrophil activation
following
polyphenol
supplementation
and
resistance
exercise is not well understood.
Therefore, the aim of this investigation was to examine
the postexercise responses of IL-8, G-CSF, and GM-CSF
within circulation and skeletal muscle tissue, as well as
the changes in granulocyte percentage and activation
(CD11b/CD18) following an acute bout of resistance
exercise designed to elicit muscle damage. Furthermore,
we examined the influence of a proprietary polyphenol
supplement on this response following an acute bout of
resistance exercise.
Methods
Participants
Thirty-eight healthy recreationally active, but untrained,
men (18–35 years old) volunteered to participate in this
study. Participants were randomly assigned to one of
three groups. The first group consumed 2 g per day of a
proprietary polyphenol blend (PPB) supplement, the sec-
ond group consumed 2 g per day of a placebo (PL), and
the third group served as control (CON), with no supple-
ment or exercise. The anthropometric performance and
compliance characteristics of the 38 participants are dis-
played in Table 1. Following an explanation of all proce-
dures, risks, and benefits, each participant
provided
informed written consent prior to completing any testing.
For inclusion in the study, participants had to participate
in <3 h of planned exercise per week, have a body mass
index of 18.0–34.9 kg/m2, be free of physical limitations,
and be willing to maintain a habitual diet while abstain-
ing from tea, alcohol, and additional dietary supplements.

 of testing (Fig. 1). Prior to the first day of testing, PPB
and PL completed a 28-day supplementation protocol.
Day 1 consisted of one-repetition maximum (1-RM) test-
ing of squat, leg press, and leg extension exercises, and
occurred at least 72 h prior to the second day of the
study. On day 2, participants arrived in the laboratory
after fasting for 12 h, and provided a resting blood sam-
ple and muscle biopsy (PRE). After blood samples were
obtained, participants were provided a small breakfast bar
(cal: 190, CHO: 19 g, protein: 7 g, fat: 13 g). After
participants consumed their breakfast bar, CON rested
for 1 h, while PPB and PL began the acute, resistance
exercise protocol. Participants provided blood samples
immediately (IP), 1 h (1H), and 5 h (5H) postexercise
(PPB and PL) or 1 h rest (CON). Additionally, muscle
biopsies were obtained at 1H and 5H postexercise. Fol-
lowing the 1H muscle biopsy, participants were provided
with a light meal (cal: 250, CHO: 34 g, protein: 14 g, fat:
6 g). Participants returned to the laboratory in a fasted
state 24 h (24H), 48 h (48H), and 96 h (96H) later for

 resting blood samples, and an additional muscle biopsy at
48H. Adherence to the fasting and diet criteria (no tea,
alcohol, or additional supplements) was verbally con-
firmed each morning with participants as they arrived for
testing.
Supplementation protocol
Both the PPB and PL groups completed daily supplemen-
tation for 28 days. The PPB group consumed a propri-
etary polyphenol blend of water-extracted green and black
tea (Camellia sinensis) containing minimum 40% total
polyphenols, 1.3% theaflavins, 5–8% epigallocatechin 3-
gallate (EGCG), 7–13% caffeine, and 600 ppm manganese
(Kemin Foods, L.C., Des Moines, IA). The PL group con-
sumed microcrystalline cellulose in capsules of similar
shape, color, and size. All products were tested for toxins
including heavy metals, pesticides, and excipients by an
independent third party.
Briefly, participants reported to the Human Perfor-
mance Lab 3–5 days per week to receive the supplement.
Participants took one dose (1 g PPB or PL) under the
supervision of a member of the research team, and were
given their prescribed doses in individual containers (1 g
PPB or PL) for each additional time point. Participants
consumed two 1000 mg doses per day for a total of
2000 mg per day of either PPB or PL daily. Participants
were asked to return all empty containers upon their next
visit to the laboratory. Participants who did not maintain
80% compliance in each phase (28 days of supplementa-
tion or during the exercise protocol and recovery) were
removed from analysis.
Nutritional analysis
Participants were provided a food log for the 2 days prior
testing, as well as each day of the testing protocol (for a
total of 6 days). Each day participants reported to the
laboratory and members of the research team reviewed
the logs with each participant. The USDA Nutritional
Database
(U.S. Department
of
Agriculture,
Beltsville,
MD) was used to analyze total calories, carbohydrates,
protein, and fat. Values are represented as the average
intake across the 6 days of data collection.
One-repetition maximum testing
Direct measurement of 1-RM maximal strength was com-
pleted on the squat and leg press exercises, while a pre-
dicted 1-RM was performed on the leg extension exercise.
All participants completed a standardized warm-up, con-
sisting of 5 min on a cycle ergometer against a self-
selected resistance, 10 body weight squats, 10 walking
lunges, 10 dynamic hamstring stretches, and 10 dynamic
quadriceps stretches. All 1-RM testing was completed as
described previously (Hoffman 2006). Briefly, each partic-
ipant completed two warm-up sets consisting of 5–10
repetitions and 3–5 repetitions at approximately 40–60%
and 60–80% of his perceived maximum, respectively.
Each participant then performed up to five subsequent
trials to determine his 1-RM with 3–5 min of rest
between each set. Exercise order was kept consistent
between participants, with 3–5 min of rest between the
squat, leg press, and leg extension.
During the squat exercise, participants placed a safety
squat bar (Power Lift, Jefferson, IA) across their shoul-
ders and descended to the parallel position, where the
greater trochanter of the femur reached the same level
as the knee. Participants then ascended to a complete
knee extension. Leg press was completed with the partic-
ipant sitting in a reclined position, with their legs
extended. Participants were asked to lower the weight
until the lower leg and femur created a 90° angle. Par-
ticipants were then asked to press the weight up. Partici-
pants who were unable to complete the repetition or
maintain proper range of motion were given one addi-
tional opportunity. If they were still unable to perform
the exercise correctly, the last completed weight was
recorded as the 1-RM.
For the leg extension exercise, participants were placed
in a seated position and were asked to extend their legs
to 180° at the knee or full extension. Participants were
asked to perform as many repetitions as possible, and the
resulting repetitions and weight used were applied to a
prediction equation (Brzycki 1993). If more than 10 repe-
titions were performed, the weight was increased and the
participant repeated the measure 3–5 min later. All test-
ing was observed by a certified strength and conditioning
specialist to monitor adherence to form.
Acute exercise protocol
Only PPB and PL completed the acute resistance exercise
protocol, while CON rested for an hour. The exercise
protocol designed to cause muscle damage in previously
untrained individuals was preceded by a light warm-up as
described above. Following the light warm-up, partici-
pants completed a resistance exercise session that con-
sisted of six sets of 10 repetitions of the squat as well as
four sets of 10 repetitions of the leg press and leg exten-
sion exercises. All exercises were completed at 70% of the
subjects’ previously determined 1-RM with 90 sec of rest
between each set. Participants were provided with assis-
tance if they were unable to complete 10 repetitions on
their own, and weight for the subsequent set was reduced.
All testing sessions were observed by a certified strength

 and conditioning specialist to monitor adherence to exer-
cise form.
Blood sampling
Blood
samples
were
obtained
at
seven
time
points
throughout the study (PRE, IP, 1H, 5H, 24H, 48H, and
96H). The PRE, IP, and 1H blood samples were obtained
using a Teflon cannula placed in a superficial forearm
vein using a three-way stopcock with a male Luer-lock
adapter and plastic syringe. The cannula was maintained
patent using an isotonic saline solution (Becton Dickin-
son, Franklin Lakes, NJ). PRE and 1H blood samples were
obtained following a 15-min equilibration period, while
IP blood samples were taken within 5 min of exercise ces-
sation. The remaining time points (5H, 24H, 48H, and
96H) were obtained using a single use disposable needle
with the subject in a supine position for at least 15 min
prior to sampling. Whole blood (20 mL) was collected in
two Vacutainer� tubes (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes,
NJ), one containing K2-EDTA and one containing no
anticlotting agents. Aliquots were removed from the first
tube for hematocrit and hemoglobin measures, as well as
flow cytometry analysis, while the second tube was
allowed to clot for 30 min prior to being centrifuged at
3000g for 15 min with the remaining whole blood from
the first tube. The resulting plasma and serum was ali-
quoted and stored at �80°C for later analysis.
Hematocrit was analyzed in duplicate from whole
blood via microcentrifugation (Statspin�, Critspin, West-
wood, MA) and microcapillary technique. Hemoglobin
was analyzed in duplicate from whole blood using an
automatic analyzer (Hemocue�, Cypress, CA). Coefficient
of variation for each assay was 0.20% for hematocrit and
0.46% for hemoglobin. Plasma volume shifts following
the workout were calculated via the formula established
by Dill and Costill (1974); however, circulating values
were not adjusted to account for changes in plasma vol-
ume.
Markers of muscle damage
Serum concentrations of myoglobin (MG) were obtained
via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Cal-
biotech, Spring Valley, CA), while CK was analyzed using
a commercially available kinetic assay (Sekisui Diagnos-
tics, Charlottetown, PE, Canada) as per manufacturer’s
instructions. To limit interassay variability, all samples for
a particular assay were thawed once, and analyzed by the
same technician using a BioTek Eon spectrophotometer
(BioTek, Winooski, VT). All samples were analyzed in
duplicate with a mean coefficient of variation of 7.57%
for MG and 3.66% for CK.
Circulating cytokine concentration
Plasma concentrations of IL-8, G-CSF, and GM-CSF were
analyzed via multiplex assay using the human cytokine/
chemokine panel one (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). All
samples were thawed once and analyzed in duplicate by
the same technician using the MagPix (EMD Millipore),
with mean coefficient of variation of 8.04%, 7.82%, and
7.10% for IL-8, G-CSF, and GM-CSF, respectively.
Fine-needle skeletal muscle biopsy
procedure
Fine-needle muscle biopsies were performed on the vastus
lateralis muscle of the participant’s dominant leg using a
spring-loaded, reusable instrument with 14-gauge dispos-
able needles and a coaxial introducer (Argon Medical
Devices, Inc., Plano, TX). Following local anesthesia with
2 mL of 1% lidocaine applied into the subcutaneous tis-
sue, a small incision to the skin was made and an inser-
tion cannula was placed perpendicular to the muscle until
the fascia was pierced (Townsend et al. 2016). The biopsy
needle was inserted through the cannula and a muscle
sample was obtained by the activation of a trigger button,
which unloaded the spring and activated the needle to
collect a muscle sample. Each muscle sample was removed
from the biopsy needle using a sterile scalpel and was
subsequently placed in a cryotube, rapidly frozen in liquid
nitrogen, and stored at �80°C. A new incision was made
for each time point, with approximately 2 cm between all
sampling sites. All muscle biopsies were performed by a
licensed medical physician.
Intramuscular cytokine protein content
Sufficient sample was not obtained from nine participants
(PPB = 2, PL = 3, CON = 4), and therefore were not
included in the intramuscular analysis. Tissue samples
were thawed and kept on ice for preparation and homog-
enization. A proprietary lysis buffer with protease inhibi-
tor (EMD Millipore) was added to each sample at a rate
of 500 lL per 10 mg of tissue. Samples were homoge-
nized using a Teflon pestle and sonication (Branson, Dan-
bury, CT, USA). Tissue samples were then agitated for
10 min at 4°C and centrifuged at 10,000g for 5 min. The
supernatant was then aspirated and used for analysis.
Total protein content was assessed using a detergent
compatible (DC) protein assay kit (Bio-Rad), and samples
were diluted to 0.8–1.2 mg/mL. Protein content of the
cytokines IL-8, G-CSF, and GM-CSF were then assessed
via multiplex assay (EMD Millipore) as per manufac-
turer’s guidelines, and normalized to the total protein
content. To limit interassay variance, all tissue samples

 were analyzed in duplicate in the same assay run by a sin-
gle technician. Average coefficient of variation was 7.46%,
13.01%, and 5.04% for IL-8, G-CSF, and GM-CSF,
respectively. Intramuscular cytokine protein content is
expressed as pg/lg total protein (Della Gatta et al. 2014).
Leukocyte preparation
Fresh, anticoagulated (K2-EDTA), whole blood (100 lL)
was mixed with fluorescent-conjugated monoclonal anti-
bodies
specific
to
CD11b-fluorescein
isothiocyanate
(FITC; Biolegend, San Diego, CA) and CD66b-phycoery-
thrin (PE; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Samples were
mixed and incubated for 15 min in the dark, after which
the samples were lysed with 2 mL of 19 FACS lysing
solution (BD Biosciences), mixed and incubated in the
dark for an additional 8 min. Following incubation, sam-
ples were centrifuged at 300g for 8 min and washed with
2 mL of 19 wash buffer containing 1% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) in a 19 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
solution. Samples were centrifuged again at 300g for
8 min, and the supernatant was removed. Samples were
then fixed in 300 lL of 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS.
Flow cytometry analysis
Cell preparations were acquired using an Accuri C6 flow
cytometer
(BD Accuri Cytometers,
Ann
Arbor,
MI)
equipped with two lasers providing excitation at 488 and
640 nm, and four band-pass filters (FL1: 533/30, FL2:
585/40, FL3 670LP, FL4: 675/25). Events were recorded
based on size (forward scatter area; FSC-A), complexity
(side scatter area; SSC-A), and mean fluorescence inten-
sity (MFI). A total of 200 lL were collected for each sam-
ple, which ensured at least 10,000 CD66b+ events.
Analysis was completed using BD Accuri analysis soft-
ware (BD Accuri Cytometers). Events were initially gated
based on side scatter height (SSC-H) and SSC-A as a
multiplet cell exclusion criteria (Fig. 2A). Granulocytes
were then determined by CD66b+ staining compared to
an unstained control (Fig. 2B and C). MFI of CD11b was
then determined for CD66b+ granulocytes (Fig. 2D).

Immune Response to Resistance Exercise
A. R. Jajtner et al.
 CD66b+ granulocytes are expressed as a percent of total
leukocytes following multiplet exclusion.
Statistics
Changes in markers of muscle damage, circulating and
intramuscular cytokines, as well as granulocyte character-
istics
were
analyzed by
a two-way,
between-subjects
repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). In the
event of a significant F ratio, a one-way, within-subjects
repeated measures ANOVA for each group and a one-
way, between-subjects ANOVA at each time point with
LSD pairwise comparisons were used for post hoc analy-
sis. Significant time and group effects were subsequently
analyzed with LSD pairwise comparisons. Non-normally
distributed data were transformed using the natural log
(LN). Area under the curve (AUC) was also calculated for
changes in circulating cytokines and myoglobin response
using a standard trapezoidal technique, and a one-way
ANOVA was used to examine differences among groups.
Raw concentrations from PRE, IP, 1H, and 5H were used
to calculate AUC prior to LN transformation. Addition-
ally, Pearson’s product–moment correlations were calcu-
lated to examine selected bivariate relationships between
granulocytes and markers of muscle damage as well as
intramuscular and circulating cytokines. Significance was
accepted at an alpha level of P ≤ 0.05 and all data are
reported as mean � SD of the original, nontransformed
data.
Results
Participant characteristics
Forty-eight participants were initially recruited for this
investigation, of which 10 were removed prior to analysis
(PPB = 6, PL = 4) for a total of 38 participants (Table 1).
Of the 10 participants removed, 5 participants requested
to discontinue testing (PPB = 4, PL = 1). Of the five par-
ticipants that wished to discontinue, one completed a
portion of the resistance exercise protocol prior to dis-
continuing the study (PPB group), two reported unre-
solvable scheduling conflicts (both from PPB group), and
two discontinued supplementation during the 28-day sup-
plementing period (PPB = 1, PL = 1). Five additional
participants who completed testing were removed from
analysis due to lack of compliance (PPB = 2, PL = 3).
Four of the five participants were removed for failure to
achieve 80% compliance with supplementation (PPB = 2,
PL = 2), while one did not adhere to the fasting require-
ments
(PL
group).
No
significant
differences
were
observed between groups for participant characteristics or
compliance.
Nutritional analysis
Nutritional intake data are presented in Table 1. No sig-
nificant interactions were observed between groups for
the average intake of total calories, carbohydrates, protein,
or fat.
Plasma volume shifts
A significant interaction was observed for changes in
plasma
volume
(F = 9.818,
P < 0.001,
g2 = 0.359).
Changes in plasma volume at IP were significantly less in
CON (�1.5 � 4.8%) compared to PPB (�17.7 � 5.8%;
P = 0.001) and PL (�15.1 � 4.3%; P = 0.001). Further-
more, at 5H, PL (0.7 � 3.7%) was significantly greater
than
PPB
(�4.0 � 7.3%;
P = 0.038)
and
CON
(�4.5 � 5.8%; P = 0.047). Considering the importance
of the cytokine to the receptor ratio, circulating markers
were not corrected for changes in plasma volume.
Markers of muscle damage
Changes in circulating myoglobin and CK concentrations
are
depicted
in
Table 2.
A
significant
interaction
(F = 17.20,
P < 0.001,
g2 = 0.503)
was
observed
for
changes in myoglobin concentrations. Post hoc analysis
indicated a significant elevation at IP, 1H, and 5H in both
PPB and PL compared to CON. No significant differences
in the myoglobin AUC response were observed between
the groups (F = 1.935, P = 0.160).
A
significant
interaction
was
observed
(F = 4.203,
P = 0.006, g2 = 0.203) for CK concentrations. Significant
elevations from PRE were noted in both PPB and PL at
24H, 48H, and 96H, with no changes observed in CON.
CK concentrations at 24H, 48H, and 96H were signifi-
cantly greater in PPB compared to PL and CON, while
PL was significantly greater than CON at 24H only.
Circulating cytokines
Data from circulating cytokine concentrations are also dis-
played in Table 2. No significant interaction (F = 0.876,
P = 0.534, g2 = 0.052) was observed for G-CSF; however, a
significant main effect for time was observed (F = 7.415,
P < 0.001, g2 = 0.188). When groups were collapsed, pair-
wise comparisons indicated significant elevations from
PRE at IP, 1H, and 5H. Additionally, IP, 1H, and 5H were
significantly greater than 24H, 48H, and 96H. No signifi-
cant between-group differences were observed for the
G-CSF AUC response (F = 0.146, P = 0.732).
No significant interactions were observed for GM-CSF
(F = 0.556, P = 0.823, g2 = 0.032); however, a significant
main effect for time was observed (F = 8.660, P < 0.001,

 g2 = 0.203). When groups were collapsed, pairwise com-
parisons indicated a significant elevation from PRE at IP
and 1H. GM-CSF was also significantly greater at IP and
1H than 5H, 24H, 48H, and 96H. In addition, GM-CSF
concentrations at 5H were significantly greater than 48H
and 96H. No significant differences were noted between
the groups in the GM-CSF AUC response (F = 0.315,
P = 0.732).
No
significant
interactions
(F = 1.297,
P = 0.250,
g2 = 0.071) were observed for changes in circulating IL-8
concentrations. In addition, no differences were noted in
the AUC response (F = 0.147, P = 0.859) for circulating
IL-8 concentration.
Intramuscular cytokine protein content
No significant interaction was observed for intramuscular
content of G-CSF or GM-CSF (F = 0.222, P = 0.937,
g2 = 0.018 and F = 0.345, P = 0.911, g2 = 0.027, respec-
tively).
Additionally,
no
differences
were
observed
between groups for the AUC analysis of intramuscular
G-CSF or GM-CSF contents (F = 0.042, P = 0.959 and
F = 2.109, P = 0.142, respectively).
Intramuscular IL-8 protein content is depicted in Fig-
ure 3. No significant interaction was observed for intra-
muscular IL-8 content (F = 1.027, P = 0.408, g2 = 0.079),
however,
a
significant
time
(F = 48.866,
P < 0.001,
g2 = 0.671) and group (F = 4.740, P = 0.018, g2 = 0.283)
effect was observed. When groups were collapsed, pair-
wise comparisons indicated that skeletal muscle content
of IL-8 was significantly increased compared to PRE at
1H (P < 0.001), 5H (P < 0.001), and 48H (P < 0.001).
Additionally, when collapsed across time, pairwise com-
parisons indicated PL was significantly greater than CON
(P = 0.024) and PPB (P = 0.010). Furthermore, AUC
analysis indicated a significant difference between groups
(F = 4.090; P = 0.030). Post hoc analysis indicated PL
was significantly greater than PPB (P = 0.011), while a
trend toward a difference was observed between PL and
CON (P = 0.066).

 significantly correlated with CK concentrations at 24H
(r = �0.635, P < 0.001) and 48H (r = �0.565, P < 0.001).
CK concentrations at 48H were also significantly correlated
with the change in granulocyte CD11b expression at IP on
granulocytes (r = 0.340, P = 0.045). No significant correla-
tions were observed between circulating and intramuscular
cytokine concentrations.
Discussion
Resistance exercise resulted in significant muscle damage
in both PPB and PL, however, the magnitude of muscle
damage appeared to be greater in PPB than PL, as
reflected by differences in CK concentrations. Circulating
IL-8 was unchanged in response to resistance exercise,
while G-CSF and GM-CSF increased independent of
group. Intramuscular protein content of IL-8 was signifi-
cantly elevated following exercise, and was greater in PL
than PPB, and trended toward a difference between PL
and CON (P = 0.066). No differences were observed for
intramuscular protein content of G-CSF or GM-CSF in
response to exercise or supplementation. Granulocyte per-
centage was significantly elevated in CON from IP to 5H
postresistance exercise, while increases in granulocyte per-
centage in PPB and PL were delayed (1H–24H). Change
in CD11b/CD18 expression occurred regardless of group,
and was elevated on granulocytes immediately following
resistance exercise at 1H. Markers of muscle damage were
moderately correlated to granulocyte proportions and
CD11b/CD18 expression following exercise (r = 0.340–
0.635), while no relationships were observed between cir-
culating and intramuscular cytokines.
The primary function of G-CSF and GM-CSF is to
stimulate granulocyte production and activation from the
bone marrow (Roberts 2005; Francisco-Cruz et al. 2014),
thus the increase in the circulating concentration of these
specific cytokines were consistent with their physiological
roles. One investigation has previously demonstrated an
increase in G-CSF following dynamic resistance exercise
(Mooren et al. 2012). To our knowledge, however, this is
the first investigation to examine the response of GM-
CSF to a dynamic resistance exercise bout. Examination
of the GM-CSF response to exercise designed to elicit
muscle damage has been minimal, with no changes previ-
ously reported (Smith et al. 2000). G-CSF, however, has
been
demonstrated
to
increase
(Paulsen
et al.
2005;
Wright et al. 2015), and remain unchanged (Smith et al.
2000; Ross et al. 2010) following exercise-induced muscle
damage. Exercise volume appears to drive this response as
exercise protocols with a greater volume (300 eccentric
contractions of knee extensors) being reported to elicit an
increase in circulating G-CSF (Paulsen et al. 2005; Wright
et al. 2015), while lower training volumes (~50 eccentric
contractions of knee flexors or hip extensors) did not
(Smith et al. 2000; Ross et al. 2010).
In vitro analysis has suggested that skeletal muscle pro-
duces G-CSF and GM-CSF in a dose dependent fashion
following mechanical stretch injury (Peterson and Pizza
2009). To our knowledge, no investigations have exam-
ined GM-CSF protein content in skeletal muscle following
exercise in vivo. Wright et al. (2015) demonstrated no
change in protein content of G-CSF following exercise-
induced muscle damage. The findings of Wright et al.
(2015) are consistent with our findings, and may suggest
that resistance exercise does not elicit production of G-
CSF from skeletal muscle. Rather, production of circulat-
ing G-CSF may be a function of systemic inflammation
associated with resistance exercise (Roberts 2005; Wright
et al. 2015). Regardless of production site, the primary
action of G-CSF and GM-CSF is the production and acti-
vation of granulocytes from the bone marrow (Roberts
2005; Francisco-Cruz et al. 2014). Therefore, circulating
concentrations may be more indicative of the overall
function of these cytokines.
While GM-CSF has been implicated in chemotaxis of
granulocytes, IL-8 also serves as a potent chemoattractant
(Ribeiro et al. 1991; Peterson and Pizza 2009). We
observed no change in circulating IL-8 concentrations in
response to resistance exercise. This is in contrast with
Nieman et al. (2004), who observed significant increases
immediately and 1 h following resistance exercise, but is
supported by Buford et al. (2009). Training status does
not appear to have influenced these results, as most inves-
tigations utilized trained participants (Nieman et al. 2004;
Buford et al. 2009; Ross et al. 2010). However, the vol-
ume of exercise used in this study (140 total repetitions)
was less than that of Nieman et al. (2004) (400 total repe-
titions; 4 sets of 10 repetitions in 10 different exercises),
and may not have been sufficient to elicit a significant
increase in circulating IL-8 concentrations.
Due to the function of IL-8 as a chemoattractant for
neutrophils (Ribeiro et al. 1991), the lack of change in
circulating IL-8 is unclear. Previous research, however,
has consistently demonstrated increased mRNA expres-
sion (Nieman et al. 2004; Buford et al. 2009; Della Gatta
et al. 2014) and protein content (Della Gatta et al. 2014)
of IL-8 within the skeletal muscle following resistance
exercise. Our results indicated a significant elevation in
intramuscular IL-8 protein content following resistance
exercise, while AUC analysis revealed a reduced exercise
response following polyphenol supplementation. As the
elevations observed in the control group in this study
contrast with that of Della Gatta et al. (2014), IL-8 pro-
tein content was greater in PL than PPB and CON. Fur-
thermore, AUC analysis does indicate a trend toward a
greater response of IL-8 to resistance exercise in PL

 compared to CON (P = 0.066). Therefore, our results
appear to support the findings of Della Gatta et al.
(2014), while also indicating polyphenol supplementation
may reduce the IL-8 response to resistance exercise.
Previous investigations have demonstrated no impact
of polyphenol supplementation in conjunction with exer-
cise on the circulating concentration of IL-8 (Nieman
et al. 2013, 2007). To our knowledge, however, no inves-
tigations have examined the impact of polyphenols on IL-
8 within skeletal muscle nor other tissue in vivo. Evidence
from in vitro models have demonstrated reduced IL-8
production
in
various
tissues
following
polyphenol
administration (Chen et al. 2002; Trompezinski et al.
2003), as well as reduced chemotaxis of neutrophils
(Takano
et al.
2004).
Therefore,
the
reduced
IL-8
response in skeletal muscle following resistance exercise
may represent a reduced proinflammatory response that
is promoted by polyphenol supplementation following
acute resistance exercise.
In this study, increases in circulating G-CSF and GM-
CSF appeared to precede the granulocytosis observed at
1H, 5H, and 24H following exercise. Expansion of the
neutrophil population has been previously demonstrated
in conjunction with increased circulating G-CSF (Paulsen
et al. 2005). Selective expansion of the granulocyte popu-
lation is also well documented following resistance exer-
cise (Miles et al. 1985; Ramel et al. 2003; Nieman et al.
2004), and exercise designed to elicit muscle damage
(Paulsen et al. 2005). Evidence from an investigation
designed to elicit muscle damage demonstrated that neu-
trophils return to baseline concentrations 24 h after exer-
cise
(Paulsen
et al.
2005).
Investigations
examining
dynamic resistance exercise, however, typically do not
report the overall granulocyte population following 24 h
of recovery in healthy participants (Miles et al. 1985;
Ramel et al. 2003; Nieman et al. 2004). It has been previ-
ously suggested that granulocytes increase immediately
following resistance exercise for approximately 2 h (Frei-
denreich and Volek 2012). Interestingly, this investigation
observed increases in the granulocyte percentage at 1H
following exercise, while CON observed increases at IP.
Malm
et al.
(2000)
previously
reported
significant
increases in the neutrophil percentage immediately fol-
lowing muscle biopsies, with decreases in the lymphocyte
percentage. Immediately following exercise, however, the
neutrophil and lymphocyte percentages were maintained
(Malm et al. 2000). Therefore, it appears that other cell
types may increase following exercise and may have artifi-
cially masked the absolute increase in the granulocytes
following exercise within this study. Therefore, the results
of this investigation appear to indicate that the granulo-
cyte expansion may be consistent with previous research,
and may be prolonged (up to 24 h) following intense
resistance exercise. Further investigation appears to be
warranted.
In
response
to
polyphenol
supplementation,
we
observed a significantly greater circulating granulocyte
percentage in PL than PPB and CON at 48H. Kerksick
et al. (2010) have previously demonstrated a significant
decrease in neutrophil concentration from 6H posteccen-
tric exercise to 48H in participants supplementing with
EGCG, while the PL group did not decrease. Given the
chemoattractant
properties
of
IL-8
for
neutrophils
(Ribeiro et al. 1991), the reduced granulocyte proportion
observed in this investigation may be related to the
reduced intramuscular IL-8 as opposed to circulating IL-
8. These findings may implicate polyphenol supplementa-
tion as a means to reduce the proinflammatory response
following resistance exercise.
The coupling of CD11b with CD18 to form CD11b/
CD18, and its involvement within the transendothelial
migration process (Tan 2012), makes CD11b a key regu-
lator of phagocyte migration to damaged tissue (Ley et al.
2007). Granulocytes migrate to damaged tissue in the ini-
tial hours following exercise (Paulsen et al. 2010). The
increased CD11b/CD18 expression on granulocytes at IP
and 1H observed in this study is consistent with the tem-
poral appearance of these cells in damaged tissue. Cur-
rently, little consensus as to the time course of the
granulocyte CD11b expression has been accepted follow-
ing exercise (Peake et al. 2005a).
Investigations utilizing aerobic exercise (van Eeden
et al. 1999; Jordan et al. 1999) and exercise designed to
elicit muscle damage (Pizza et al. 1996; Saxton et al.
2003; Peake
et al. 2005b)
have previously
examined
CD11b expression on granulocytes. However, no investi-
gations that we are aware of have examined the impact of
dynamic resistance exercise on CD11b expression on
granulocytes. Previously, Malm et al. (2000) has demon-
strated muscle biopsies to impact the immune response.
Our results indicate that muscle biopsies can stimulate
increases in CD11b expression on granulocytes at IP and
1H; however, it is difficult to distinguish between the
effect of the muscle biopsy and exercise in this study. Evi-
dence from previous investigations indicates exercise may
also influence the CD11b response on granulocytes. Vari-
ous studies have reported significant increases immedi-
ately following aerobic exercise (van Eeden et al. 1999;
Jordan et al. 1999), which may persist for up to 30 min
postexercise (van Eeden et al. 1999). Following downhill
running,
however,
Peake
et al.
(2005b)
reported
no
changes in CD11b expression during the recovery period
in well-trained men. Similarly, studies examining 50
eccentric contractions of the quadriceps (Saxton et al.
2003) or 25 eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors
(Pizza et al. 1996) in moderately trained men, reported

 no change in CD11b expression up to 24 h postexercise.
The studies evaluating CD11b post downhill run and
eccentric contractions, however, first measured CD11b
expression at 4 and 1.5 h postexercise, respectively. We
observed an increase in the expression of CD11b on gran-
ulocytes at IP and 1H, which was prior to any of the
measurements assessed by Saxton et al. (2003) or Pizza
et al. (1996). Pizza et al. (1996) did demonstrate a signifi-
cant increase in CD11b expression 24 h following their
damaging protocol. The results of this present study pro-
vide some support as we indicated a trend for an
increased expression at 24H (P = 0.086).
Taken together, the present study demonstrates that an
acute, intense resistance exercise bout will stimulate a
proinflammatory response of the immune system in
untrained men. Furthermore, polyphenol supplementa-
tion may limit this proinflammatory response, specifically
by reducing intramuscular IL-8 protein content. As shown
in previous research, it does appear that muscle biopsies
may exacerbate this immune response (Malm et al. 2000).
Since the current study design necessitated the use of
biopsies for assessment of intramuscular cytokine content,
future research should aim to confirm the findings of this
study in circulation without the potential influence of
skeletal
muscle
biopsies.
Furthermore,
as
absolute
immune cell counts were not obtained, the findings of
this study are limited to the proportion of granulocytes
within circulation, relative to the total number of leuko-
cytes. Future research should focus on the absolute
changes of these populations as well as the impact of
polyphenol supplementation on other aspects of the
immune response to resistance exercise.
