2015; doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.00864.2015.—Accurate prediction of
the metabolic energy that walking requires can inform numerous
health, bodily status, and fitness outcomes. We adopted a two-step
approach to identifying a concise, generalized equation for predicting
level human walking metabolism. Using literature-aggregated values
we compared 1) the predictive accuracy of three literature equations:
American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), Pandolf et al., and
Height-Weight-Speed (HWS); and 2) the goodness-of-fit possible
from one- vs. two-component descriptions of walking metabolism.
Literature metabolic rate values (n � 127; speed range � 0.4 to 1.9
m/s) were aggregated from 25 subject populations (n � 5-42) whose
means spanned a 1.8-fold range of heights and a 4.2-fold range of
weights. Population-specific resting metabolic rates (V
˙ O2rest) were
determined using standardized equations. Our first finding was that the
ACSM and Pandolf et al. equations underpredicted nearly all 127
literature-aggregated values. Consequently, their standard errors of
estimate (SEE) were nearly four times greater than those of the HWS
equation (4.51 and 4.39 vs. 1.13 ml O2·kg�1·min�1, respectively). For
our second comparison, empirical best-fit relationships for walking
metabolism were derived from the data set in one- and two-compo-
nent forms for three V
˙ O2-speed model types: linear (�V1.0), exponen-
tial (�V2.0), and exponential/height (�V2.0/Ht). We found that the
proportion of variance (R2) accounted for, when averaged across the
three model types, was substantially lower for one- vs. two-compo-
nent versions (0.63 � 0.1 vs. 0.90 � 0.03) and the predictive errors
were nearly twice as great (SEE � 2.22 vs. 1.21 ml O2·kg�1·min�1).
Our final analysis identified the following concise, generalized equa-
tion for predicting level human walking metabolism: V
˙ O2total �
V
˙ O2rest � 3.85 � 5.97·V2/Ht (where V is measured in m/s, Ht in
meters, and V
˙ O2 in ml O2·kg�1·min�1).

lism; wearable sensors
THE METABOLIC ENERGY THAT WALKING requires can be accurately
measured, but it is difficult to predict in the absence of direct
measurement. Two factors have prompted extensive efforts to
develop predictive equations: the fundamental importance of
walking metabolism to the body’s health, fitness, and physio-
logical status, and the impracticality of direct measurement
under most circumstances. The large majority of the many
predictive equations that currently exist were developed on
small, homogeneous populations using best-fit approaches.
This includes the two leading standardized equations (3, 36)
that have been heavily used since their original formulations
decades ago. Accordingly, the large majority of existing equa-
tions have not been validated beyond the test populations on
whom they were developed, and many have not been validated
at all. With the advent of affordable, wearable sensors capable
of incorporating predictive algorithms, the importance and
potential application of these algorithms have arguably never
been greater. Nonetheless, a comprehensive assessment of the
relative accuracy, or lack thereof, of the algorithms that cur-
rently exist is largely unavailable.
The two most established and commonly used predictive
equations, the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM)
(3) and Pandolf et al. (36) equations, respectively, were devel-
oped using very small, homogeneous populations of adult men.
Each partitions the body’s total or gross, mass-specific meta-
bolic rate during walking into resting and nonresting compo-
nents, quantifying the latter as a single, speed-dependent com-
ponent. However, they differ formulaically in how they do so:
the ACSM equation quantifies the relationship between walk-
ing speed and metabolic rate as a linear function, whereas the
Pandolf et al. equation uses an exponential description. The
former equation is heavily used throughout health, fitness, and
clinical communities; the latter is heavily used for military
purposes. To date, independent assessments of the accuracy of
these standard equations have been surprisingly limited given
their broad acceptance and widespread use. Consequently, their
general accuracy, the predictive consequences of their different
mathematical forms, and their ability to generalize to popula-
tions other than adult men of average stature are largely
unknown.
We recently formulated a model with potentially broader
applicability to human walking metabolism. Our approach
deviated from the long-standing practice of testing populations
that are homogeneous with respect to both age and body size
(3, 9, 16, 36, 48). We did so because our earlier work indicated
that age, long considered to be a factor explaining the elevated
metabolic requirements of children, has no quantifiable effect
when body size and related gait mechanics are taken into
account (49). Hence we used body size stratification as an
experimental tool for model development to maximize the
generalizability of our model. Formulaically, the Height-
Weight-Speed (HWS) model that resulted, like the Pandolf et
al. model, describes the metabolic rate vs. speed relationship as
exponential, but it does so with two features that differ from
literature norms (Fig. 1). The first is that walking metabolism
is partitioned into two components: one that is primarily
postural and constant across speed, and a second that is
speed-dependent. The second differentiating feature is that the
term describing speed-dependent increases in walking meta-
bolic rates includes an inverse relationship to stature (Vexp/Ht).

 This second feature quantifies the economizing influence of
stature on walking metabolism (15, 18, 31, 33, 49, 51).
In our original study, these features apparently allowed our
HWS model to achieve greater overall accuracy than either the
ACSM or Pandolf et al. models for the level condition inves-
tigated. For our sample of 78 subjects who varied substantially
in body size (derivation group, n � 39; validation group, n �
39), the HWS model was able to predict measured metabolic
rates to within an average of 8.1 � 6.7%. Additionally, we
found the predictive error of the HWS model to be one-third
that of the two older standardized equations on our validation-
group subjects, and less than half that when only larger or adult
subjects were assessed. These results raised several questions
regarding the basis of the predictive accuracy originally ob-
served for our HWS model. First, from a technical standpoint,
the relative accuracy of the HWS model was likely overrepre-
sented because we evaluated our own model, but not the other
two, with data acquired under identical conditions with the
same instrumentation. Second, from a scientific standpoint, our
original study did not reveal the extent to which the largely
distinct features of the HWS model were responsible for the
greater predictive accuracy achieved. Specifically, we did not
know the predictive importance of 1) the addition of a second
metabolic component for walking metabolism, and 2) the
incorporation of height into predictions of speed-dependent
increases in walking metabolic rates.
Our overall goal was to identify a concise, broadly accurate
equation for predicting metabolic rates during level human
walking. For this purpose, we used the existing literature to
compile a data set that was well-stratified with respect to both
the walking speeds and body sizes of the subject populations
included. We used this data set to pursue our overall objective
in two analytical steps. First, we assessed how accurately the
aforementioned three equations were able to predict the fully
independent metabolic rate values in the literature data set.
Second, we used the different mathematical forms of these
three equations to identify the elements that are essential for
broad, accurate prediction. This included specifically evaluat-
ing whether the total or gross walking metabolic rates in the
data set would be more accurately described when the
walking, or nonresting portion, of the body’s total metabolic
rate consisted of two components rather than one. Accord-
ingly, we formulated both one- and two-component versions
of three V
˙ O2-speed model types: linear (�V1.0), exponential
(�V2.0), and exponential with an inverse relationship to
height (�V2.0/Ht).
Our first hypothesis was that the error of the HWS model
equation in predicting the literature data set values would be
less than half that of both the ACSM and Pandolf et al.
equations. Our second hypothesis was that accounting for 90%
of the total data set variability would be possible when walking
metabolism was quantified with two components, but not
possible when quantified with only one.
METHODS
Experimental Design
We adopted a literature compilation approach to evaluating the
relative accuracy with which formulaically different models predict
human walking metabolism for several reasons. First, the existing
literature is now sufficiently expansive to comprehensively incorpo-
rate the influences of height, weight, and speed on level walking
metabolic rates. Second, the aggregation of means from many studies
should mitigate measurement or condition-specific error from indi-
vidual studies. Finally, contemporary digitizing techniques allow data
published in graphic form to be extracted with a high degree of
accuracy (21, 43). Collectively, these factors should allow for the
aggregation of a robust, powerful data set for investigating our two
hypotheses regarding energy cost of level human walking.
Hypothesis Tests One and Two
Based largely on the prior results reported on 78 individuals who
spanned a broad range of body sizes (51), we expected two hypothesis
test outcomes. First, we expected that the error with which the
aggregated literature means would be predicted by the ACSM and
Pandolf et al. equations would be at least two times larger than the
corresponding error of prediction of the HWS model equation using
the standard error of estimate (SEE) as our evaluative standard.
Second, we expected that the SEE would, on average, be at least twice
as large when the walking portion of the body’s total metabolic rate
was modeled with one component rather than two. Furthermore, as
general evaluative standards for whether each model was able to fit to
the aggregated data set well, we set a priori thresholds of �90% of the
total data set variance explained and �10% error in the accuracy of
the estimates of individual data set values. These thresholds were set
in accordance with our expectation that an accurate model should 1)
account for 90% of the total variability in the data set and 2) have a
predictive error of less than 10% of the grand mean of the 127 values
in the data set. The first threshold was quantified using the R2 statistic,
the second using the coefficient of variation, here calculated using the
SEE divided by the grand mean of the values (n � 127) in the data set
(i.e., SEE/grand mean � 100).
Data Set Criteria
Our literature data set was strategically aggregated to broadly
encompass the influences of height, weight, and speed on human
walking metabolism. However, we did not seek to acquire all the valid

 data available from the literature. We avoided this because doing so
would have skewed the data set toward the adult populations that are
overrepresented in the literature. Accordingly, nearly all of the suit-
able literature data from subadult populations was included, whereas
much of the data available from adult populations was not. The
criteria for determining whether the literature values available quali-
fied for inclusion were as follows. First, the mean height and weight
of the group had to be reported in the original study. Second,
metabolic means from a sufficient number of speeds to provide a
minimum value for the energy expended per unit distance, or meta-
bolic cost of transport, needed to be available. Third, to avoid speeds
in the walk-run transition range that were too fast to be true walking
speeds, we implemented a standardized maximum-speed cut-off using
an analog of the Froude number (51) adapted from Alexander (2):
Fr � walking speed ⁄�g · (ht · 0.52),
(1)
where walking speed is in units of m/s, height is in meters, and g is the
gravitational constant in m/s2. The Froude number is widely used to
quantify speeds that are equivalent for walkers and runners who differ
in body size. The standard Froude index does so using leg length.
Here, as previously, we used a Froude number analog that substitutes
height for leg length because studies on walking metabolism generally
report the height means of the groups tested, but often do not report
leg length. To avoid including values that were at or above the
walk-run transition we removed data points with a Froude analog
value of �0.65. We limited our analysis to subjects of normal weight,
excluding groups of people who were classified as obese in their
respective original publications. We excluded data from subject
groups �65 years of age because the metabolic cost of walking is
generally elevated in elderly subjects (35) for reasons that have not yet
been fully identified. We included populations of a minimum age of
3–5 years because they exhibit adult-like patterns for gait and metab-
olism when leg length is taken into account (18, 49).
Digitizing Process
Values for group means were acquired from the tables or figures in
prior publications. Those data points acquired from figures were
digitized in accordance with the highly accurate techniques now
available (21, 43). Original illustrations were enlarged and oriented on
a grid to allow precise vertical and horizontal line fits to the data point
of interest. Line fits were extended to the x- and y-axes to determine
the x and y values for each data point. Data point values were also
determined using an automated digitizer available online [WebPlot-
Digitizer (40)].
Data Set Characteristics
Using the inclusion criteria specified, our literature search from the
early 1900s to the present yielded 25 subject groups from 10 publi-
cations (Table 1) spanning a 50-year period from 1960 to 2010. The
number of subjects per population group ranged from 5 to 42. Mean
age ranged from 5.2 to 40.7 years, mean height ranged from 1.03 to
1.82 m, and mean body mass ranged from 18.9 to 78.0 kg. Body mass
index ranged from 15.5 to 25.4 kg/m2. A minimum of four and a
maximum of six metabolic rate values from different walking speeds
were acquired from the different population groups (mean � 5.1 �
0.7 values per population group), resulting in a total of 127 values in
the final data set. Of the 127 group means included, 95 were acquired
from subjects walking on treadmills, whereas 32 were acquired from
overground walking at constant speeds. The grand mean for the rate
of O2 uptake from the 127 values aggregated was 14.0 ml
O2·kg�1·min�1.
Predictive Accuracy—Original HWS Model vs. ACSM and Pandolf
et al.
According to the forms of the three respective literature equations
provided in Table 2, literature values were predicted using the ACSM
and Pandolf et al. equations on the basis of walking speed. For the
original HWS model, literature values were predicted using walking
speed, estimated V
˙ O2rest, and the mean height of each population
group. The agreement between actual and predicted values across the
three equations was evaluated using both the R2 statistic and SEE.

 Walking Metabolism Models
The specific forms of the one-and two-metabolic components used
to model the walking, or nonresting portion, of gross walking metab-
olism were guided by both the primary literature traditions and our
recent modeling efforts. Our recently introduced HWS model of
walking metabolism appears schematically in Fig. 1 (51). Partitioning
gross or total metabolic rates into a baseline component that corre-
sponds to resting metabolic rate and an exercise component is a
common practice (31, 41, 49–51). However, the HWS model is
atypical in dividing the walking component of the body’s total
metabolic rate into two components: a constant, predominantly pos-
tural component, termed the minimum walking metabolic rate; and a
second speed-dependent component. The novel component of the
HWS model, the minimum-walk component, is attributed to the
support and postural costs of the walking movement and is indepen-
dent of walking speed (51). The speed-dependent component quanti-
fies the simultaneous influences of walking speed, height, and gait
mechanics as previously described (51). The HWS model incorporates
body mass into the denominator of each metabolic component and
takes the following form:
VO2total �
VO2rest
Ç
Resting Metabolism
�
C1 · VO2rest
Ç
Minimum Walking
� �C2 · Vexp� · Ht�1
Ç
Speed-Dependent
Ç
Walking Metabolism
(2)
where V
˙ O2total is the body’s total rate of oxygen uptake; V
˙ O2rest is the
body’s supine resting rate of oxygen uptake; C1 is a coefficient that
describes the minimum walking rate of oxygen uptake as a multiple of
the resting rate; and C2 is a coefficient describing the speed-dependent
increases in the rate of oxygen uptake as a function of walking
velocity, V, raised to the exponent, exp, divided by the height (Ht) of
the individual. Hence the sum of the model’s second and third
components represents the metabolic rate attributable to walking
(V
˙ O2walk). All the terms in Eq. 2 are expressed in mass-specific units
of oxygen uptake of ml O2·kg�1·min�1 in accordance with literature
convention and for consistency with the original publication for the
HWS model. The theoretical basis for the model, including its mass-
specific form, has been previously provided (51). Per our scientific
objectives, Fig. 1, Eq. 2, and our previous work, the term “metabolic
rate” is used to refer to mass-specific rates of oxygen uptake through-
out the manuscript.
Resting Metabolic Rates
The resting portion of the gross or total walking metabolic rates in
our literature data set was determined on the basis of height, weight,
sex, and age for each of the 25 population means using the prediction
equations of Schofield et al. (42). These equations have been exten-
sively validated and are known to predict resting metabolic rates with
a high degree of accuracy, typically in the range of 0.5 ml
O2·kg�1·min�1 (19, 26, 38, 39, 47, 50). Because all of the predictive
models tested incorporated the same Schofield-derived resting meta-
bolic rate quantity, this portion of the total or gross metabolic rate
attributed to V
˙ O2rest did not differ across all the model types tested.
We did not use measured V
˙ O2rest data because these values were not
reported in most of our literature sources. We converted the units of
kJ/day
from
the
Schofield
equation
to
oxygen
units
of
ml
O2·kg�1·min�1 using the conversion factor of 20.1 J per milliliter of
oxygen. Schofield equations modified to oxygen units appear in Table
4 of the original HWS manuscript (51).
Modeling Iterations, Analyses, and Equations
Models of three basic forms for describing the metabolic rate vs.
walking speed (V) relationship were evaluated: linear (�V1.0), expo-
nential (�V2.0), and exponential with an inverse relationship to height
(�V2.0/Ht). For each of the three model types, both one- and two-
component versions were derived. The equations corresponding to
these six different model derivations are provided in Table 3. The
procedures used to determine the best fits of these model forms to the
literature data set are described below.
Model Best-Fit Procedures
For each of the three basic model forms, separate model versions
were derived, a first that treated net walking metabolism as a single
entity; and a second that partitioned walking metabolism into two
components: a constant, largely postural component, and a separate
speed-dependent component in accordance with the schematic in Fig.
1. For consistency and ease of interpretation, the postural component
of walking metabolism was modeled the same way across the three
model types, specifically as a multiple of V
˙ O2rest, therefore equal to
the quantity C1·V
˙ O2rest according to Eq. 2.
To maximize the fits provided by each equation, the coefficients
derived were those that provided the best fit to the data points acquired
from the literature sources (i.e., highest R2 value) across the range of
height, weight, and walking speeds present. The coefficient describing
the minimum walking metabolic rate (C1) in the two-component
models, and the coefficient describing the speed-dependent walking
metabolic rate (C2) in all models were specifically optimized to
minimize the sum-squared error of prediction. The optimizer function
in Microsoft Excel was used because of its ability to optimize a
coefficient while holding other values such as estimated resting
metabolic rate, walking velocity, and height fixed at their known
values [Microsoft Excel Solver, Excel 2010 version (24)]. Once
best-fit equations were derived they were used to estimate walking
V
˙ O2 values for all 127 literature data points and subsequently plotted
against walking speed.
We also tested a seventh model, the modified HWS model, which
has only a two-component form and differed from the first six in that
the minimum-walk component was modeled as a constant absolute
value (in ml O2·kg�1·min�1) across all group means rather than as a
multiple of the group-specific V
˙ O2rest values. We did so because our
prior results (51) raised the possibility of limited predictive bias being

˙ O2Walk Minimum as a multiple of V
˙ O2rest. In
this case, the equation consisted of V
˙ O2rest, a constant in ml
O2·kg�1·min�1 that replaced the C1·V
˙ O2rest term, and a coefficient
(C2) times walking velocity squared divided by height. Additionally,
to further investigate the importance of height as a predictor we also
analyzed the modified-HWS model without height in the equation.
Validation of Modified-HWS Model on Data from Individual
Subjects
Upon completing our model evaluation we tested how well the
derived equation predicted values previously acquired from individual
subjects. We did so using previously published level walking meta-
bolic data collected from 57 individuals (30 men, 27 women) whose
heights ranged from 1.07 to 1.89 m, and weights ranged from 15.9 to
88.95 kg (51).
Derivation of a Final Generalized Equation
Once the essential elements for broad accurate prediction were
formulaically established using the full data set, our final analytic step
was to identify the best-fit coefficients for the equation form identi-
fied. We did so using only those values in the data set acquired using
the gold standard technique for measurements of exercise metabolism,
the Douglas bag method (13). For this purpose, we used all the
Douglas bag values in the data set excepting those from Maffeis et al.
(29), whose walking metabolic rate (V
˙ O2walk) values for subjects of
1.37 m in height were, for unknown reasons, substantially higher than
those from other sources in the data set for subjects of similar height.
The final equation was derived on 42 group mean values. For these 42
group means, subject height ranged from 1.19 to 1.73 m, weight
ranged from 22.5 to 71.6 kg, and walking speed ranged from 0.44 to
1.80 m/s.
Data Set Categorization by Stature
The 127 values for population group-mean metabolic rates in our
aggregated data set appear in Fig. 2A as a function of walking speed.
The influence of height on gross walking metabolic rates led us to
classify these values by stature using a three-category scheme of short,
intermediate, and tall. These stature classifications were not necessary
for, and indeed were not part of, our formal hypothesis tests. Rather,
we implemented these classifications to allow for visual evaluation of
whether the different model versions evaluated fit the walking meta-
bolic rate values equivalently across the different stature means
present in the data set, or were biased toward shorter or taller
individuals. The stature, weight, and age means of the populations in
the short, intermediate, and tall groups appear in Table 4.
Also, for graphical purposes, within each height classification
group, we determined representative metabolic rate vs. speed relation-
ships as follows. For each of the three groups, we averaged the
literature metabolic rate data points acquired to determine values at or
near six speeds: 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 1.3, 1.6, and 1.8 m/s. The precise speeds
for the respective height groups varied slightly in accordance with the
different protocol speeds administered in the different literature
sources. This process allowed us to formulate trend lines for the
metabolic rate vs. speed relationships that corresponded to the liter-
ature values for each of the three respective height classification
groups (Fig. 2B). These trend lines, which appear in grayscale, were
formulated to provide a visual reference for evaluating each model’s
ability to fit both the stature- and speed-variability present in the data
set.
RESULTS
Digitizing Accuracy
The average absolute percent difference between the 20
original numeric values [Fig. 1A in (49)] and those acquired via
digitization was found to be �1.00% in 17 of the 20 cases
when values were obtained by the grid technique. Across these
20 data points, the error ranged from 0.03 to 2.43% with an
overall mean of 0.65%. Using three different published graphs
and original data sets [Fig. 1A in (49), Fig. 2A in (51), and Fig.
4A in (51)] with a combined 47 data points, the absolute
percent difference between the measured data and the derived
data was �0.60%. When using the automated digitizer, the
original values and digitized values across the 47 data points
agreed to within an average of 0.51% [WebPlotDigitizer (40)].

of the 127 original literature means by the respective equations
are plotted as a function of walking speed (Figs. 3–7, left).
Second, the same respective, predicted values are subsequently
plotted vs. their actual values (Figs. 3–7, right). The height

those figures in which equation-predicted values are plotted in
relation to speed (Fig. 3, A, C, and E; and Figs. 4–7, A and C).
The best-fit coefficients derived for the one- and two-com-

exponential, and exponential with height) appear in Table 5.
The goodness-of-fit of each of the six equations derived is
provided graphically in two formats that follow the original
graphic presentations of the literature values appearing in Fig.
2, A and B. For each of the six respective best-fit equations
derived, one- and two-component version are vertically juxta-
posed in the upper and lower portions of Figs. 4, 5, and 6. The
one-component model forms and corresponding predictions
appear at the top of each figure (A and B), whereas the
two-component model forms appear in the bottom of each
figure (C and D).
Each illustration of the goodness-of-fit between actual and
predicted or estimated values includes an R2 value for the fit
provided and the corresponding SEE. The grand mean for all of
the values in the literature data set was 14.0 ml O2·kg�1·min�1.
Accordingly, those fits with SEE values below 1.40 ml
O2·kg�1·min�1 met our criteria of a coefficient of variation of
�10%.
Hypothesis Test One: Predictive Accuracy of HWS vs.
Standard Equations
The metabolic rates predicted for each of the 127 literature
means using the ACSM (3), Pandolf et al. (36), and original
HWS equations (51) appear as a function of walking speed in
Fig. 3, C and E, and in relation to the actual values in Fig. 3,
B, D, and F. The ACSM and Pandolf et al. equations were
largely unable to predict the 127 values in the literature data
set. In both cases, the proportion of variance accounted was
less than zero, indicating that the error between predicted and
actual values was greater than the total variability present in the
data set. The HWS equation was considerably more accurate,
accounting for just over 90% of the total variability present in
these values.
Both the ACSM and Pandolf et al. equations result in
significant underprediction of walking metabolic rate for all
height groups; however, for the tall group, Pandolf et al.
accurately predicts values at the intermediate and faster speeds,
whereas the ACSM equation does not (Fig. 3, A and C). When
plotting predicted vs. measured metabolic rates, the tendency
toward underprediction by both equations is obvious. Almost
all the data points fall on or below the line of identity for the
ACSM equation (Fig. 3B), and all but a limited number of data
points predicted by Pandolf et al. also fall below the line of
identity (Fig. 3D). In contrast, the values predicted by the
original HWS model fall relatively close to their respective
height group trend lines (Fig. 3E) and to the line of identity
(Fig. 3F). The predictive error (SEE) of the original HWS
model equation was roughly one-fourth that of the ACSM and
Pandolf et al. equations. Both ACSM and Pandolf et al.
equations had greater predictive error than the benchmark SEE
value (1.40 ml O2·kg�1·min�1), whereas the HWS model
equation had appreciably less.
We also tested the predictive accuracy of the ACSM, Pan-
dolf et al., and HWS equations on the subset of literature values
from adults only because both ACSM and Pandolf et al. were
designed to serve adult-only populations. For adult groups, the
R2 value for measured vs. predicted data points was 0.50 and
the SEE was 2.69 ml O2·kg�1·min�1 using the ACSM equa-
tion. For the Pandolf et al. equation, the R2 value was 0.71 and
SEE was 2.06 ml O2·kg�1·min�1 for the adult values. For both
ACSM and Pandolf et al. equations almost all the adult values
in the data set were underpredicted. In contrast, the HWS
equation resulted in an R2 of 0.90 and SEE of 1.21 ml
O2·kg�1·min�1 in predicting the same adult values.
Hypothesis Test Two: One- vs. Two-Component Models
Linear model results. The best-fits resulting from the linear
forms of one- and two-component metabolic rate vs. speed
models appear in Fig. 4. The best-fit from the one-component
model slightly underpredicted the values of the shorter groups
of subjects and overpredicted the values of taller ones (Fig.
4A). The stature-biased predictions were largely absent in the
best-fit predicted values from the two-component form of the
linear model (Fig. 4C). Both the one- and two-component
model forms exhibited speed-dependent bias (Fig. 4, B and D).
In both cases, the metabolic rate means at relatively slow and
fast walking speeds tended to be underpredicted, whereas those
at intermediate walking speeds were generally overpredicted.
The goodness-of-fit and SEE of the two- vs. one-component
model demonstrated only marginally better agreement (�R2 �
0.03 and �SEE � 0.14 ml O2·kg�1·min�1), primarily because
the addition of the second component allowed the stature-
related stratification of the literature means to be fit somewhat
more closely.
Exponential model results. The best-fit equation predictions
from the one- and two-component exponential models appear in Fig.
5. The one-component exponential model fit the literature values
relatively poorly and was the only one of the six best-fit equations that
did not account for at least half of the total variance present in the
literature data set (R2 � 0.50; Fig. 5, A and B). The literature means
at the slowest walking speeds were predicted least accurately and
were consistently lower than the actual values. The predictions at
faster speeds were also in error, being generally higher than the actual
values (Fig. 5B). In contrast, the best-fit relationship from the two-
component exponential model accounted for �90% of the total
variance present in the literature values (Fig. 5D) because the addition
of the minimum walking component substantially improved the
agreement with the actual values at all speeds, particularly the slower
ones (Fig. 5C). The agreement between the two-component, best-fit
estimated and actual values indicated slight speed-dependent bias

 with most of the values at the slower and faster speeds falling just
below the line of identity indicating slight underprediction (Fig. 5D).
Exponential model with height results. The best-fit equation
estimations derived for the two-component exponential model with
height included appear in Fig. 6. The addition of height to the
exponential model improved the one-component fit to the literature
values slightly but did not improve the two-component fit at all. The
one-component exponential model with height substantially under-
estimated the literature values at the slower walking speeds across all
three height classification groups (Fig. 6, A and B). Best-fit estima-
tions at the faster speeds were more accurate but tended toward
overestimation, particularly for the values at the fastest walking
speeds. The two-component exponential model with height provided
a substantially better fit than the one-component model, primarily by
improving the accuracy of the estimations for the values at the
slowest walking speeds (Fig. 6, C and D), although a slight tendency
toward underestimation among the tallest groups remained. The
estimations of the intermediate and faster speed values were generally
accurate and without obvious speed-dependent bias or trends. The
two-component model with height was the second of the six best-fit
equations derived that was able to capture greater than 90% of the
total variance present among the literature data set means.

 By comparison, the two-component model with minimum-
walk-component treated as a constant absolute value resulted
in an SEE of 1.00 ml O2·kg�1·min�1 (Fig. 7D), indicating that
this refinement of our HWS model improved the goodness-of-
fit to our literature data set. Modifying the first of the two
walking, or nonresting, components of the HWS model re-
moved the slight bias toward underprediction at the slowest
walking speeds that were present in both of the exponential
two-component models. For each of the three height-classifi-
cation groups, the literature means at the slow, moderate, and
faster walking speeds all conformed closely to the correspond-
ing height classification trend lines (Fig. 7C). The error present
in the values predicted from the modified HWS model vs. the
actual literature values was small and equally distributed above
and below the line of identity across the full range of walking
speeds and metabolic rate values.
The modified-HWS model equation was able to fit the
literature values more closely when speed-dependent in-
creases in walking metabolic rates were described as an
exponential function with an inverse relationship to height
vs. without. When height was not included as a predictor,
the SEE was 1.5 times greater and the proportion of variance
accounted for was nearly 10% lower (Fig. 7, B and D).
When height was absent from this form of the model, values
were overestimated for the tallest groups and underesti-
mated for the shortest groups (Fig. 7A), with the greatest
disagreement occurring at the fastest speeds for the shortest
subject populations.

DISCUSSION
Our two-step strategy for identifying the elements that are
essential for accurate generalized prediction of level human
walking metabolism was indeed effective. Our first test re-
vealed that the two leading standardized equations that predict
walking metabolism are inadequate for humans of different
body sizes walking across a broad range of speeds on level
surfaces. Our second test identified the quantitative elements
that are required for accurate generalized predictions, but
lacking in the leading standardized equations. In both cases, the
primary conclusion supported is that accurate generalized pre-
dictions are possible when the body’s walking, or nonresting,
metabolism is quantified with two components, but not possi-
ble when quantified with only one.

 Quantitatively, our first hypothesis test indicated that the
group-mean metabolic rate values in our data set were pre-
dicted four times more accurately (SEE) by the HWS model
equation, which includes two components for walking metab-
olism, vs. the leading literature equations (3, 36) that include
only one (Fig. 3). The relative differences in predictive error of
the leading standard equations vs. that of the HWS equation
identified here actually exceed those we previously reported
(51) on individual data. This quantification of larger differ-
ences in the independent data set compiled here indicates that
our original study did not in fact overrepresent across-equation
differences in predictive accuracy as it might have. Our second
hypothesis test outcome indicated that in each of the three
model forms, the best fits possible to the literature data were
unable to account for either the speed- or stature-related vari-
ance present when they included only one component to
describe the walking, or the nonresting, portion of the body’s
total metabolism (Figs. 4–6, A and B). In two out of three
model types evaluated, the SEE was more than twice as large
when walking metabolism was modeled with one component
vs. two. Collectively, across the three model types on average,
the one- vs. two-metabolic component versions provided
poorer overall fits (�R2 � �0.27) with substantially larger
predictive errors (�SEE � �1.21 ml O2·kg�1·min�1).
Hypothesis Test One: Predictive Accuracy of Existing One-
vs. Two-Component Equations
Our first hypothesis test revealed that predictions of level human
walking metabolism were roughly four times more accurate when
based on our two-component HWS model equation vs. the leading
one-component equations from the literature (Fig. 3). Certainly, some
of the difference in predictive accuracy observed across these equa-
tions would be expected given 1) the presence of an additional
metabolic component in the HWS model, 2) the formulation and
validation of the HWS model on a data set similarly heterogeneous to
that aggregated here, and 3) the broader conditional objectives the
ACSM and Pandolf et al. equations were meant to serve for adult-
only populations (3, 36). The first two factors we have addressed
throughout the manuscript, the last we were able to partially address
here. For the 66 adult-population values in our literature data set, the
respective predictive errors of the ACSM and Pandolf et al. equations
were 2.2 and 1.7 times greater than that of the HWS model equation.
Thus much of the difference in predictive error we identified for the
entire data set was also present even when comparisons were limited
to values from the adult-only populations that the ACSM and Pandolf
et al. equations were meant to serve.
A primary contributor to the relative predictive errors we
report is the substantial skew with which the leading literature

 equations predict the existing literature data. Of the 254 total
values predicted by the ACSM and Pandolf et al. equations
combined only seven were overpredicted, whereas the remain-
ing 247 values were underpredicted by these two equations
(Fig. 3, B and C). Although the tendency toward underpredic-
tion has been noted previously for the ACSM equation (1, 8,
10, 25, 51), the substantial intrinsic bias of both equations has
not been previously documented. Almost certainly, a portion of
the bias identified is attributable to the narrow original deriva-
tions of the respective equations. The Pandolf et al. equation
was derived from data from six male soldiers of similar body
size (36). The level portion of the ACSM equation was derived
from only three adult men (22). The skew and systematic error
now evident for both of these widely used equations under
level conditions highlights a significant weakness in this heav-
ily researched area. Leading generalized equations were de-
rived from populations that were too small and homogeneous
to provide broadly accurate predictions.
Hypothesis Test Two: One vs. Two Metabolic Components
for Walking Metabolism?
The distribution of values in our literature data set (Fig. 2, A
and B) requires accurate formulaic descriptions to account for
two visually evident features: 1) the near-baseline differences
in total metabolic rates at slow walking speeds that are related
to stature and mass, and 2) the curvilinear increases in walking
metabolic rates across speed that have modest slope differences
across stature groups (Fig. 2, A and B). The first feature is
unsurprising given that the greater mass-specific rates of rest-
ing metabolism in shorter, less-massive individuals are well
established (42). The constant V
˙ O2rest values that we used
across all our model iterations (Table 1, Fig. 2B, horizontal
lines) addressed this reasonably because this single factor
accounted for an appreciable portion of the across-group dif-
ferences in total metabolic rates at slower walking speeds. The
second feature posed the perhaps greater quantitative chal-
lenge of simultaneously describing a metabolic rate vs.
speed relationship that is curvilinear for all of the population
groups in the data set, but with greater stratification than can
be accounted for by differences in resting metabolism alone.
One consequence of these distribution features was that
best-fit differences between one- and two-component model
versions differed substantially by model type.
The form of our linear model resulted in almost no differ-
ence in the relative goodness of the fits provided between the
one- and two-component versions. In both cases, group-spe-
cific differences in V
˙ O2rest values allowed group differences at
slower speeds to be reasonably approximated. Metabolic rate
increases across speed were described by slope values that
differed little between one- and two-component best-fit ver-

 sions (Table 5). Consequently, both the goodness-of-fit in-
crease (�R2 � �0.03) and predictive error decrease (�SEE �
�0.14 ml O2·kg�1·min�1) that resulted from the addition of a
second component were negligible. The inability of a linear
model to describe the curvilinear metabolic rate vs. speed
relationship resulted in substantial speed-dependent error in the
best-fits achieved by both versions.
In contrast to the similar best-fits observed across one- and
two-component versions of the linear model type, respective
best-fit differences across both exponential model types were
large. For both the exponential models with and without height
included, describing the entire walking, or nonresting, portion
of the total metabolic rate as single component substantially
overpredicted the slope of the metabolic rate vs. speed rela-
tionship. The exaggerated slopes forced by single-component
exponential fits resulted in large underestimations of metabolic
rate values at slower speeds and overestimations at faster ones
(Figs. 5A and 6A, respectively). The addition of the second
component to both model types reduced the slopes (Table 5) to
align more closely with those actually present (Figs. 5C and
6C). Improved slope alignment also allowed model best-fit
estimations at slower walking speeds to align more closely
with the actual values of the different height groups. Conse-
quently, both two-component exponential model versions were
able to account for �90% of the total data set variance with
predictive errors �10% of the grand mean.
Although the best-fits provided by our two-component ex-
ponential models exceeded our general criteria for good overall
fits, both exhibited modest speed-dependent estimation bias vs.
the line of identity. Slower-speed values were underestimated
by both versions, whereas faster speed values were underesti-
mated by the exponential model version that did not include
height (Figs. 5D and 6D). The nature of the speed-dependent
estimation bias present was consistent with our postulation that

 modeling the minimum-walk component as a multiple of
group-specific V
˙ O2rest values might overestimate across-group
differences at slower walking speeds. Accordingly, we modi-
fied our two-component exponential model with height (Eq. 3)
to describe the minimum-walk component using the same
constant (ml O2·kg�1·min�1) across all 25 population groups.
The resulting best-fit exhibited little to no discernible speed-
dependent bias vs. the line of identity, accounted for a slightly
greater proportion of the total variance, and had the lowest
predictive error of all seven of our best-fit modeling iterations
(Fig. 7D).
Body-Size Dependency of Walking Economy: Is Height
Needed for Predictive Accuracy?
On the asis of our previous findings, we anticipated that the
model forms with the speed-dependent component expressed
inversely to height would better describe walking metabolic
rates than models that did not include this feature. However,
across the two-component exponential models, this was not the
case. The best-fit provided by the two-component model that
did incorporate height to describe speed-dependent increases in
walking metabolic rates was no better than the best-fit provided
by the two-component exponential model that did not (Fig. 5D
vs. Fig. 6D). This result may at first seem inconsistent with two
previous findings: 1) of a near-inverse relationship between
stature and the energy walkers expend per unit distance (49);
and 2) the predictive accuracy previously achieved when in-
corporating height in the same formulaic manner (51). How-
ever, the cursory interpretation that height is unimportant is
incorrect.
The consistency with which gross, mass-specific walking
metabolic rates have been reported to be inversely related to
height has been essentially absolute (15, 18, 29, 31, 33, 49, 51).
Indeed, this consistency is responsible for the distribution of
walking metabolic rate values by stature classification groups
evident in our literature data set (Fig. 2). Although a portion of
the stature-related differences in the gross metabolic rates
consistently observed results from the greater resting metabolic
rates of smaller, less massive individuals, the majority of the
difference is attributable to the walking or nonresting portion
[Fig. 2 here, Fig. 1 in (49)]. Indeed, when we analyzed the
current walking metabolic rate data (i.e., V
˙ O2total � V
˙ O2rest per
Eq. 1) to quantify the height-transport cost relationship (COT,
O2/kg·m) at the mechanically equivalent walking speeds that
different-sized individuals typically self-select per our earlier
analysis (49), we again found a large, negative, and nearly
inverse relationship (COT �Ht�0.77). Thus on a strictly bio-
logical level, our results here and those from previous literature
are consistent in indicating that height is a fundamental deter-
minant of level human walking economy.
The relative unimportance of height as a predictor across our
exponential models resulted from the majority of the height-
related variance being accounted for in the first of our two-
model components of walking metabolism. Because this first
component, the minimum-walk component, was modeled as a
multiple of resting metabolic rates that vary by stature and
mass (Table 3), the minimum-walk component values across
different stature groups were greater for shorter populations
and smaller for large ones, thereby accounting for much of the
stature-related variance in the walking metabolic rates. Thus
the incorporation of height into the second and speed-depen-
dent metabolic component (as V2/Ht) did not improve the
best-fit provided because the stature-related variance had al-
ready been largely accounted for. This aforementioned effect
becomes visually apparent in the modified HWS iterations that
treated the minimum-walk component as a constant and there-
fore did not indirectly incorporate the influence of height into
this portion of walking metabolism (Fig. 7). The version of this
iteration which did not include a heightvariety of technologies-
related treatment in either walking component, was unable to
account for stature-related variation in metabolic rates across
all speeds, particularly faster ones (Fig. 7, A and B). However,
when height was added to the speed-dependent component of
this model version, the best-fits for populations of different
statures across all speeds were the closest of all of our model
iterations (Fig. 7, C and D).
Why Are Two Nonresting Components Needed to Describe
Human Walking Metabolism?
The most immediate scientific question raised by our con-
clusion that two metabolic components are required to ade-
quately describe human walking metabolism is: To what extent
does the two-component conclusion from our whole-body
modeling approach correspond to internal physiological real-
ity? Clearly, the ability to selectively activate tissues and tissue
compartments within the muscular system across speed makes
our simplified two-component description theoretically possi-
ble. The first component purportedly represents a constant
minimum walking metabolic “baseline” set by the volume of
muscle recruited largely to satisfy postural requirements. The
second component purportedly represents speed-dependent in-
creases in metabolic rates resulting from disproportionate in-
creases in muscular activation across faster walking speeds.
However, direct evaluation of these ideas is limited by the
inability to measure metabolic rates within the body on a
tissue-by-tissue basis.
Given this basic measurement limitation, investigators have
used a number of indirect approaches to infer differential tissue
contributions to the body’s total walking metabolic rates. Of
these, two partially overlapping approaches have been the most
informative. The more direct of the two has been the use of
surface electromyography (EMG) to measure the electrical
activity of individual muscles (11, 12, 23, 34). The EMG
studies available provide reasonable support for disproportion-
ate increases in neuromuscular activity at faster walking
speeds. Several of these indicate that hip flexor and extensor
muscles that are largely inactive at slower walking speeds
become activated at faster ones. These studies also demonstrate
disproportionately large increases in knee extensor muscle
activity across faster speeds that coincide with the greater knee
extensor moments also observed (6, 23, 34). A less direct but
more comprehensive approach is the detailed musculoskeletal
modeling (20, 34, 37) that has advanced rapidly in the last
decade. This approach uses forward dynamic simulations
based on extensive kinematic, anatomical, neural, and physio-
logical inputs. When applied across walking speeds, these
detailed models also identify de novo recruitment of hip flexor
and extensor muscles, and disproportionate increases in knee
extensor muscle activation across the faster walking speeds.

 Finally, we note that earlier investigators who adopted a
combined theoretical-empirical approach to modeling whole-
body walking metabolic rates reached a two-component con-
clusion similar to ours. Workman and Armstrong (53) used an
energy-per-step framework in conjunction with direct measure-
ments to develop their original equation for predicting level
walking metabolic rates. Their lengthy equation, which also
incorporates height, has been shown to be relatively accurate
across a range of walking speeds and for different individuals
(51). A retrospective scientific consideration of their work by
the original authors led them to conclusions that have been
largely overlooked, but are highly relevant here. Both the
conceptual model [Fig. 5 in (52)] and quantitative conclusions
they ultimately reached agree closely with ours even though
the data and theoretical framework used were fully indepen-
dent.
Summary and Future Recommendations:
On a practical level, empirical evidence now exists to
conclude that the HWS model offers a more accurate alterna-
tive to the ACSM or Pandolf et al. equations for nonobese
children and adults (�65 years) walking on firm, level sur-
faces. In addition to the accuracy already noted, our modified
HWS equation offers several other noteworthy features. First,
the HWS equation (Eq. 3) appears to be similarly accurate for
both treadmill and overground conditions because we found
virtually no difference in the goodness-of-fit (Eq. 3 and Fig.
7C) between the values from these conditions (�R2 � 0.03 and
�SEE � 0.15 ml O2·kg�1·min�1). Second, two of the three
metabolic terms in the HWS equations presented can be com-
bined by adding a minimum-walk component constant to a
population-specific V
˙ O2rest value to provide a concise two-term
equation. Finally, for adult-only populations, the need for
population-specific V
˙ O2rest values can be eliminated without
any appreciable loss of accuracy. Simply using a global V
˙ O2rest
constant of 3.3 ml O2·kg�1·min�1, added to the 3.85 ml
O2·kg�1·min�1 constant for the minimum-walk component
from Eq. 4 yields the following equation:
V
�
O2total � 7.15 � 5.97·
V2
Ht ,
(5)
which fits our adult literature data set values with an R2 �0.93
and an SEE of �1.0 ml O2·kg�1·min�1.
Our expectation is that our final modified-HWS equations (Eqs. 4
and 5) will prove to be accurate in subsequent validations, but a
degree of caution is warranted. We opted to derive the final form
using only the Douglas bag values in our literature data set because
measurements from both laboratory and portable metabolic systems
are typically slightly but systematically higher than Douglas bag
values. Accordingly, Eq. 4 represents our best present generalized
equation to describe what the actual O2 uptake values during level
walking will be. To assess this expectation on values acquired from
individuals per the expected use of the equation, we evaluated Eq. 4
using data previously acquired from individual subjects (51). The
resulting predictions conformed to the level of accuracy expected,
with a resultant R2 of 0.88 and SEE of 1.35 ml O2·kg�1·min�1 for a
height, weight, and age-stratified group of 57 subjects. However, we
note that the laboratory metabolic system we use provides excellent
agreement with Douglas bag values, whereas many others do not (4,
17). Accordingly, users of those metabolic systems that tend to
provide slightly but systematically higher values may experience
better agreement with the best-fit equation derived on the full litera-
ture data set (Eq. 3), which includes values acquired from these
systems. However, given the general acceptance of the Douglas bag
method as the most valid technique, we believe Eq. 4 represents the
concise, broadly accurate generalized equation we sought to identify.
Concluding Remarks
The emergence of an accurate, robust generalized relationship to
predict the energy expended during level human walking is arguably
scientifically overdue in addition to being practically opportune. From
a basic standpoint, human walking has been studied far more exten-
sively than any other animal gait. Nonetheless, a concise, relationship
with predictive capabilities that could generalize across walking
speeds and regardless of body size had not emerged (51) due to a
tradition of focusing heavily on across-population differences rather
than identifying the truly generalized relationships. This record con-
trasts with the robust, generalized relationships that exist for mam-
malian metabolism at rest (28) and during locomotion (44–46). In
each of these cases, generalized relationships formulated on the basis
of large data sets were established decades ago. Indeed, our experi-
mental strategy here drew directly upon the comparative tradition of
maximizing both speed and body-size related influences on locomo-
tor metabolism.
From a practical standpoint, the relationship we report could
be used to predict walking energy expenditure either with or
without contemporary technology because the inputs required
are minimal. Although present use is limited to level surfaces,
under such conditions only velocity data are required if height
and body weight are known. Thus low-tech field uses can be
implemented with only time and distance inputs to compute an
average velocity. In fitness settings, the equations we present
here (Eqs. 3 and 4) could be used during level treadmill
walking at known speeds. Across settings, technology-enabled
implementations abound because many wearable sensors now
provide velocity data (14). These include global positioning
systems, geo-locating smart phones, and precision pedometers
that determine speed from a variety of technologies and which
are available from numerous manufacturers.
As health, medicine, military, and personal monitoring
merge with mobile technologies, the accuracy of the general-
ized relationships available will be a primary determinant of
the validity of the data streams that will inevitably become both
widely available and heavily used.
