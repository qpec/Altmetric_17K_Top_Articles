Post-marketing withdrawal of 462
medicinal products because of adverse
drug reactions: a systematic review of the
world literature

Abstract
Background: There have been no studies of the patterns of post-marketing withdrawals of medicinal products to
which adverse reactions have been attributed. We identified medicinal products that were withdrawn because of
adverse drug reactions, examined the evidence to support such withdrawals, and explored the pattern of
withdrawals across countries.
Methods: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, the WHO’s database of drugs, the websites of drug regulatory
authorities, and textbooks. We included medicinal products withdrawn between 1950 and 2014 and assessed the
levels of evidence used in making withdrawal decisions using the criteria of the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based
Medicine.
Results: We identified 462 medicinal products that were withdrawn from the market between 1953 and 2013, the
most common reason being hepatotoxicity. The supporting evidence in 72 % of cases consisted of anecdotal
reports. Only 43 (9.34 %) drugs were withdrawn worldwide and 179 (39 %) were withdrawn in one country only.
Withdrawal was significantly less likely in Africa than in other continents (Europe, the Americas, Asia, and Australasia
and Oceania). The median interval between the first reported adverse reaction and the year of first withdrawal was
6 years (IQR, 1–15) and the interval did not consistently shorten over time.
Conclusion: There are discrepancies in the patterns of withdrawal of medicinal products from the market when
adverse reactions are suspected, and withdrawals are inconsistent across countries. Greater co-ordination among
drug regulatory authorities and increased transparency in reporting suspected adverse drug reactions would help
improve current decision-making processes.

Background
Drug regulatory authorities award marketing authoriza-
tions that license pharmaceutical companies to market
medicinal products when there is sufficient evidence that
the product has a favourable benefit-to-harm balance [1].
If a new adverse drug reaction is suspected after approval,
several courses of action can be taken by the regulator
and/or manufacturer, including adding a new product
label with specific warnings [2], adding a new contraindi-
cation [3], issuing a Direct Healthcare Professional
Communication [4], allowing patients to decide whether
they will take the drug [5], and in the most serious cases,
withdrawal or revocation of the licence [6].

 compounds (i.e. effective for treating the specific indica-
tion, but for which the benefit-to-harm balance was
considered unfavourable), and loss of revenue for drug
manufacturers. When there is no concrete evidence link-
ing drug use with a suspected adverse reaction, such
withdrawals can be contentious.
We have previously reported inconsistencies in the
pattern of withdrawals of 95 medicines to which deaths
were attributed [7]. To date, there has been no compre-
hensive and systematic review of medicinal products
that have been withdrawn because of adverse drug reac-
tions in general. In addition, there is a paucity of data
about the evidence on which such withdrawal decisions
are based. Furthermore, the pattern of post-approval
withdrawals across geographical regions worldwide has
never been examined. Therefore, we performed a sys-
tematic review to identify medicinal products that
have been withdrawn after approval because of any
kinds of adverse drug reactions; to assess the types of
evidence on which the withdrawal decisions were
based; to identify the types of attributed adverse drug
reactions
responsible;
to
examine
the
patterns
of
withdrawal across geographical regions; to examine
the intervals between launch dates and (1) the times
of the first reports of adverse reactions and (2) the
first dates of withdrawal; and to examine the intervals
between the first reports of adverse drug reactions
and the first withdrawals.

the market because of adverse drug reactions between

Please see Additional file 1: Web 1 for full list of drug
regulatory websites assessed.
For each medicinal product withdrawn, we then
searched PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar for the
first reported adverse drug reaction.
Search terms used included “drug withdrawal”, “fatal*”,
“death(s)”, “side effect”, “adverse effect”, “adverse reac-
tion”, “adverse event”, “poison”, “toxicity”, “voluntary
recall”, “suspension”, “prohibition”, “banned”, “remov*”,
“revoke*”, “discontinued” (a Medline search strategy is
included as a Additional file 2: Web 2). If we could not
find information for a medicinal product using its chem-
ical name for searches, we used the trade name or code
name. We also searched the references of retrieved full
texts for any earlier dates of reports of suspected adverse
reactions. If an article had evidence of an earlier re-
ported date, that date was chosen as the first adverse re-
action date. If a drug was withdrawn because of two or
more adverse reactions, we used the first reported date
of any such reactions.
To determine the accuracy of launch dates, we
compared the information on the WHO database of
Consolidated List of Products with the information in
the Merck index, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing
Manual, and a newly developed database for withdrawn
and discontinued products [11]. To determine the dates of
first withdrawal and countries of withdrawal, we cross-
checked WHO data with the database for withdrawn
products; if the information was not found in that data-
base, we compared the dates with the results of searches
in PubMed and Google Scholar.
Inclusion/exclusion criteria
We define a medicinal product as “Any substance or
combination of substances which may be used in, or ad-
ministered to, human beings, either with a view to
Onakpoya et al. BMC Medicine  (2016) 14:10 
Page 2 of 11
 restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions
by exerting a pharmacological, immunological or meta-
bolic action, or to making a medical diagnosis” [12]. For
the purpose of our review, such applications could be
via oral, intravenous, intramuscular, sublingual, inhala-
tional, rectal, or topical routes. To be included in the
review, a product must have been withdrawn from the
market because of reports of a suspected adverse reac-
tion or reactions, or problems related to hazards or
harms. We included medicinal products that had previ-
ously been withdrawn (by regulatory authorities and/or
drug manufacturers) because of adverse reactions but
had been re-introduced or made available in other, safer,
formulations. When only one formulation of a product
was withdrawn, the product was included in the list, and
the formulation was noted; however, if all formulations
of the product were subsequently withdrawn, we used
the earliest date, irrespective of formulation, as the year
of first withdrawal. We did not exclude products based
on routes of administration. We excluded medicines for
which there was documented regulatory evidence that
they had been voluntarily withdrawn by marketing
authorization holders solely for commercial reasons, or
withdrawn based on contamination of the active ingredi-
ent by other agents (such as organisms and active or
toxic compounds). We also excluded herbal products,
non-human medicines, and non-prescription medicines.
Assessing the types of evidence
We documented the highest level of available evi-
dence before the year of first withdrawal of products,
based on the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine
(OCEBM) criteria [13] rating the levels of evidence of
harms as follows: Level 5, mechanism-based reasoning
(lowest); Level 4, case-series or case-control studies; Level
3, non-randomized, cohort, or follow-up studies; Level 2,
randomized clinical trials; and Level 1, systematic reviews
(highest). One reviewer (IJO) documented the levels of
evidence, which were independently verified by a second
reviewer (JKA). Discrepancies were resolved through
discussion.
Data extraction
For each withdrawn product, we extracted data on the
date of marketing authorization, the launch date, or the
date of first recorded use; the drug class and therapeutic
indication [14]; the year in which an adverse drug reac-
tion related to the reason for withdrawal was first
reported; the year of first withdrawal; the country or
countries of withdrawal; and the reported organ or sys-
tem that was affected by the drug. When the exact
launch date of a product was not available (16 cases), we
used the first date of reported use in humans by cross-
checking references on PubMed with Medline. If two or
more adverse reactions were reported as reasons for
withdrawal, we used the date of the first reported
reaction.
One reviewer (IJO) extracted the data and a second re-
viewer (JKA) verified them independently. When there
were discrepancies in the attributed dates, the reviewers
re-checked the dates together and arrived at a consensus
by discussion.
Statistical analyses
We used summary tables to document the intervals be-
tween launch year and the year of first reports of adverse
drug reactions, the interval between launch year and the
year of first withdrawal, and the interval between the
first report of an adverse drug reaction and the year of
first withdrawal. Because these intervals were skewed,
we used medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) as mea-
sures of central dispersion.
We used scatter plots to explore the relationships be-
tween launch dates and times to first reports of adverse
drug reactions and withdrawals.
Because drug regulatory systems in most African
countries are not well developed [15–17], we compared
withdrawal rates in Africa with five other continents.
We computed the relative rates (RR) and 95 % confi-
dence intervals (CI) of withdrawals per country in Africa
versus the other five continents. A P value <0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Results
We identified 644 withdrawn medicinal products (Fig. 1),
of which 96 were excluded because they were marketed
as herbal or over-the-counter preparations, another 75
because they were withdrawn for commercial reasons,
one (ergometrine) because of instability in tropical condi-
tions, five because they had no pharmacological actions
(e.g. colourings and artificial sweeteners), three because
the reason for withdrawal was contamination, one because
there was no information on adverse reactions, and one
because it was not licensed through conventional drug ap-
proval procedures, leaving 462 products. The withdrawals
occurred between 1953 and 2013 (except for dinitrophe-
nol which was first withdrawn in 1938 in the USA, and
prohibited for use in humans again by the FDA in 1986).
The details of the withdrawn drugs are available in
Additional file 3: Table S1.
Levels of evidence used for drug withdrawals
The levels of available evidence that triggered drug with-
drawal decisions, according to the OCEBM criteria, are
shown in Table 1. Of the 462 included products, case
reports were used as evidence for withdrawals in 330 in-
stances (71 %); in 49 cases (11 %), withdrawal decisions
were based on the results of animal studies. Of products

 launched after 1950 (n = 354), case reports were used
as evidence in 247 instances (70 %). The comparable
figures for each decade since 1950 are as follows:
1950s 85 % (58/68 products); 1960s 74 % (65/88);
1970s 69 % (54/77); 1980s 68 % (34/50); 1990s 64 %
(27/45); 2000–2008, 35 % (9/26).
Types of adverse drug reactions
Hepatotoxicity (81 cases; 18 %) was the most commonly
reported adverse drug reaction that led to withdrawal
(Additional file 3: Table S1), followed by immune-related
reactions (79 cases; 17 %), cardiotoxicity (63 cases; 14 %),
neurotoxicity (76 cases; 16 %), haematological toxicity (53
cases; 11 %), carcinogenicity (61 cases; 13 %), and drug
abuse and dependence (52 cases; 11 %). Deaths were asso-
ciated with withdrawals in 114 cases (25 %).
Patterns of withdrawals
Of the 462 products, 43 (9.3 %) were withdrawn world-
wide and 179 (39 %) were withdrawn in only one

 country; the remaining 240 (52 %) were withdrawn in
two or more countries. In terms of withdrawals by geo-
graphical region, 63 products were withdrawn in Africa,
150 in Asia, 32 in Australasia and Oceania, 309 in
Europe, 134 in North America, and 65 in South America
(Table 1). The rate of withdrawals per country was
significantly lower in Africa than in Asia, Australasia,
Europe, North America, or South America (Table 2).
However, there were no significant differences in the
relative rates of withdrawals across the five African sub-
regions (data not shown).
Interval between launch year and first reported adverse
drug reaction
The median interval between launch year and the
year in which an adverse reaction was first reported
was 8 years (IQR, 2–20) for all the drugs and 4 years
(IQR, 1–10) for drugs launched after 1960.
The more recent the launch date of a drug, the
quicker a report of an adverse reaction appeared in the
literature (Fig. 2). A similar trend was observed for drugs
launched after 1960.
Interval between launch year and first withdrawal
The median interval between first launch and first with-
drawal was 18 years (IQR, 6–34) for all the drugs and 10
years for drugs introduced after 1960 (IQR, 3–19). There
were trends towards shorter delays between the year of
first launch and the year of first withdrawal for all 462
drugs and for the 286 products launched after 1960
(Fig. 3).
Interval between the first reported adverse drug reaction
and the first withdrawal
The median interval between the first reported adverse
reaction and the year of first withdrawal was 6 years
(IQR, 1–15) for all drugs and 3 years for drugs launched
after 1960 (IQR, 0–8). Figure 4 shows that there was a
trend towards a shorter interval between the first
reported adverse reaction and the first withdrawal. How-
ever, for drugs launched after 1960, there was no con-
sistently shorter trend. Similar results were observed
when we examined the delays to withdrawal after re-
ports of adverse drug reactions in each of the six conti-
nents separately (data not shown).
Relation between time of launch to first adverse drug
reaction report versus the interval between the first
adverse drug reaction report and the first withdrawal
Figure 5 shows that quicker reports of adverse drug re-
actions were not associated with a corresponding short-
ening of the time to regulatory action following such
reports. This finding was also observed for medicinal
products launched after 1960.
Discussion
We have identified 462 medicinal products withdrawn
because of adverse drug reactions between 1953 and
2013. Hepatotoxicity and immune-mediated reactions
were responsible for over 30 % of withdrawals, and death
was attributed as among the reasons for withdrawal in

aThe P values have been corrected for multiple tests using the Bonferroni method. The relative rates of withdrawal are calculated based on the assumption that if
a medicinal product was withdrawn in one country, it should also have been withdrawn in all countries in that continent. The data for total populations are
obtained from the 2013 World Population Data Sheet (http://www.prb.org/pdf13/2013-WPDS-infographic_MED.pdf). This analysis excludes 43 medicinal products
withdrawn worldwide

 25 % of instances. Withdrawals were significantly less
common in Africa than in Asia, Europe, and North and
South America.
Evidence for withdrawal
Case reports were most often used as evidence on which
withdrawal decisions were based, being used in 71 % of
all the products, 70 % of those launched after 1950, and
66 % of those launched after 1960. This corroborates
our previous finding that case reports were most com-
monly used as evidence for withdrawal of 95 medicinal
products because of drug-attributed deaths [7], and
confirms that formal studies are often not conducted
when adverse drug reactions are reported anecdotally
[18]. However, the frequency with which anecdotal re-
ports have provided the dominant source of information
has reduced with time, from 85 % in the 1950s to 64 %
in the 1990s; since 2000, the frequency has fallen even
further, to 35 %, but the number of products affected
during the last few years is relatively small.
Patterns of withdrawal
There were significantly fewer withdrawals in Africa
than in the other five continents. This suggests that

launch year)

 there is better co-ordination among drug regulatory au-
thorities in those geographical regions than in Africa.
Furthermore, the delays between the first report of an
adverse reaction and first withdrawal were more often
than not longer in African countries than in Europe or
North America, which were not significantly different
from each other. Thus, harmful drugs are likely to stay
on the market for longer in Africa.
There was a lower rate of withdrawal in African coun-
tries than elsewhere. Factors that can affect withdrawals
include the strength of a local regulatory agency, and the
availability of proper monitoring facilities or preventive
strategies. According to the WHO, only 4 % of African
nations have moderately developed pharmacovigilance
systems and 39 % lack adequate regulatory capacity [19].
Furthermore, the ability of a country to restrict access to
harmful drugs is related to per capita gross national
product [20], and this contributes to the so-called medical
poverty trap (increases in overall out-of-pocket expenses
for health care in families who are already poor) [21].
Delays between launch dates and reports of adverse drug
reactions
The interval between first launch and first report of ad-
verse reactions has shortened over time (Fig. 2). This is
probably largely due to improved pharmacovigilance,
better methods of signal detection, and better reporting
of suspected adverse drug reactions. However, at least 5
years elapsed before the first report of an adverse drug
reaction in 31 % of instances for products launched after
1960, suggesting that detection of adverse reactions to
approved medicinal products has improved with devel-
opments in drug regulation, but the improvements have
not been substantial. This may be attributable to a var-
iety of factors, such as selective reporting of benefits and
harms in clinical trials [22] and flawed regulatory as-
sessment procedures [23], which have led to calls for
changes to current drug adverse event monitoring
strategies [24, 25].
Regulatory assessment of clinical trials data of medicinal
products is seldom conducted in many African countries,
where the drug regulatory processes are geared to grant
marketing licences for imported products that have been
assessed in other places and populations.
Under-reporting of adverse drug reactions
Under-reporting of adverse drug reactions could cause
delays in making withdrawal decisions. There is evidence
that clinicians selectively report adverse drug reactions
[26, 27], and the authors of a review of hospital admis-
sions due to adverse drug reactions concluded that phy-
sicians seldom report such events when they occur [28].
A low rate of reporting among health-care professionals
could be due to poor knowledge of how to use the spon-
taneous reporting systems [29], conflicts of interest [30],
forgetfulness, lack of time, and uncertainty about causal
relationships between drugs and adverse events [31].
Proactive measures to encourage physicians to report
suspected adverse drug reactions have been suggested
[32]. Indeed, provision of economic incentives and/or
educational activities improves the reporting of adverse
drug reactions among hospital clinicians [33–37]. Pa-
tients are also likely to under-report suspected adverse
reactions to medications [38], and empowerment of pa-
tients has been advocated [39, 40].
Delays to withdrawals after reports of adverse drug
reactions
There was no consistent reduction in the interval be-
tween the first report of an adverse drug reaction and
Fig. 5 Interval between first launch and first ADR report (Interval 1) versus time to withdrawal after first ADR report (Interval 3)

Page 7 of 11
 the first withdrawal from the market (Fig. 5), suggesting
that the shortened interval between the first launch and
the first withdrawal was largely due to a shortening in
the interval between the first launch and the first report
of an adverse reaction. Therefore, difficulty in assessing
causality and inconsistencies in how regulatory actions
are enforced after reports of suspected adverse drug re-
actions could explain the observed delays and discrepan-
cies (Fig. 6); this is corroborated by the absence of a
relationship between the interval between first launch
and first adverse drug reaction report (Interval 1) versus
the interval between first adverse drug reaction report
and first withdrawal (Interval 3; Fig. 6). We note that
from 1985 onwards, over 80 % of withdrawals occurred
within 5 years of initial adverse reaction reports compared
with just over 50 % for the 462 products, suggesting that
the delays to withdrawal following reports of adverse reac-
tions has generally improved since the thalidomide inci-
dent of the 1960s. Difficulties in determining causality in
part explain why drugs are withdrawn in one country but
remain available in another. The need to develop a univer-
sally accepted algorithm for diagnosing adverse drug reac-
tions has been highlighted [41, 42].
Frequency of withdrawals compared with overall new
drug approvals
The number of withdrawn medicinal products is prob-
ably only a small fraction of overall approvals. As exam-
ples, less than 2 % of new drug approvals by the FDA
between 1950 and 2011 [43] and 3 % of approved prod-
ucts in Canada and the USA between 1992 and 2011
were withdrawn [44], suggesting that drug regulatory au-
thorities have made considerable efforts at ensuring that
harmful drugs are not marketed.
Comparison with previous studies
We have confirmed and extended the result of previous
studies, all of which have been considerably smaller and
of more limited time spans. We have also documented
the levels of evidence used for making the withdrawal
decisions, analysed time courses, and included data from
African countries, not previously reported.
For example, an analysis of 19 medicinal products
withdrawn between 2002 and 2011 showed that case
reports were commonly used to justify withdrawal de-
cisions, but less so with time [45]. A review of 121
withdrawn products showed that hepatotoxicity, cardio-
toxicity, and carcinogenicity were the most common rea-
sons for withdrawals between 1960 and 1999 [46]. There
were inconsistencies in the patterns of withdrawal of 26
products between 1971 and 1992 in the UK and the USA
[47], and in drug withdrawal policies across countries [48],
although an earlier study of 24 products suggested
consistency in withdrawal patterns between the UK and
USA from 1964 to 1983 [49]. In a study of 22 products
withdrawn in Canada between 1990 and 2009 [44], the
median interval between approval and withdrawal was 3.5
years (IQR, 1.9–7.9); our data, analysed over the same

 period, show a value of 3 years (IQR, 1–6; n = 72). Our re-
sults are consistent with all of these findings.
Strengths and limitations
We used robust methods to search for medicinal products
withdrawn because of adverse reactions and documented
the evidence on which the withdrawal decisions were
based. In addition, we accessed data from a variety of
sources. However, we recognize some limitations. We do
not have information on the delay between the actual oc-
currence of an adverse drug reaction due to a medicinal
product and the date it first appeared in the literature.
Nevertheless, such delays are unlikely to have significantly
influenced the results. We do not have data from coun-
tries in Africa that are blighted by armed conflict, e.g.
Burundi, the Central African Republic, and Somalia; in-
deed, we did not identify any information on withdrawn
medicinal products from these countries in the WHO
drug lists. Furthermore, as of 2009, over half of all African
countries did not have a drug regulatory website [50]. We
did not access data from non-English drug regulatory
websites; however, we do not think that the information
from such sites would significantly alter our results, since
a majority of such countries report their data to the
WHO. In addition, the accuracy of the information from
the databases used to document launch and withdrawal
dates has not been assessed, but we did use information
from other selected texts to check for any inconsistencies.
Furthermore, we do not have data on countries in which
withdrawn drugs were approved by regulatory authorities,
where such exist; this difficulty has previously been re-
ported by other authors [47].
We may not have identified all medicinal products with-
drawn in association with adverse drug reactions because
of the possibility of negative publication bias, and we do
not know how many patients in all were affected by ad-
verse reactions. This could also have influenced the speed
with which regulatory decisions were taken. Some medi-
cines are available only on prescription in some regions
and may be available over the counter elsewhere. For ex-
ample, antibiotics are generally available as prescription-
only medicines in the UK [51]; in contrast, the results of
surveys in Nigeria showed that self-medication with anti-
biotics and antimalarial drugs was common both in the
general public and among healthcare workers [52, 53].
Recommendations
� Universal guidelines for determining when a drug
should be withdrawn when serious adverse drug
reactions are suspected should be developed and
promoted.
� More efforts should be made towards strengthening
drug monitoring systems in low- and middle-income
economies, especially in Africa; the proposal by the
WHO in collaboration with African Union countries
to establish an African Medicines Agency by 2018 is
a welcome development.
� Regulatory authorities and drug manufacturers
should expedite action when adverse drug reactions
are suspected; formal studies to test for such
associations should be conducted sooner rather than
later; temporary suspensions or restrictions could be
considered.
� There should be more transparency in reporting
adverse events observed during clinical trials; access
to clinical study reports should be a priority for
future drug regulation.
� More active engagement of health professionals and
patients in reporting suspected adverse drug
reactions should be encouraged.
Conclusions
The interval between launch date and reports of adverse
drug reactions has shortened over the past few decades,
perhaps because of better reporting of suspected adverse
reactions or stricter regulation. In addition, increasing
numbers of individuals may have been exposed to the
withdrawn products in recent years, leading to quicker
detection of adverse reactions. However, withdrawal of
products following reports of suspected adverse reac-
tions, sufficiently serious to warrant withdrawal, has not
improved consistently over the last 60 years. In addition,
harmful drugs are less likely to be withdrawn in African
countries. Greater co-ordination among drug regulatory
authorities and increased transparency in the reporting
of suspected adverse drug reactions would help improve
decision-making processes.
