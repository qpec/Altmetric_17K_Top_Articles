In Brief
Zika virus (ZIKV) is causing devastating
epidemics with severe disease. Shan
et al. generated an infectious cDNA clone
of ZIKV as well as a luciferase reporter
virus. Recombinant ZIKV is virulent in
mice and infectious in Aedes aegypti and
thus may help identify viral determinants

SUMMARY
The Asian lineage of Zika virus (ZIKV) has recently
caused epidemics and severe disease. Unraveling
the mechanisms causing increased viral transmissi-
bility and disease severity requires experimental sys-
tems. We report an infectious cDNA clone of ZIKV
that was generated using a clinical isolate of the
Asian lineage. The cDNA clone-derived RNA is infec-
tious in cells, generating recombinant ZIKV. The
recombinant virus is virulent in established ZIKV
mouse models, leading to neurological signs relevant
to human disease. Additionally, recombinant ZIKV
is infectious for Aedes aegypti and thus provides a
means to examine virus transmission. The infectious
cDNA clone was further used to generate a luciferase
ZIKV that exhibited sensitivity to a panflavivirus
inhibitor, highlighting its potential utility for anti-
viral screening. This ZIKV reverse genetic system,
together with mouse and mosquito infection models,
may help identify viral determinants of human viru-
lence and mosquito transmission as well as inform
vaccine and therapeutic strategies.
INTRODUCTION
The current explosive epidemic of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the
Americas poses a global public health emergency. ZIKV is a
member of the Flavivirus genus within the Flaviviradae family.
Flaviviruses have a positive-strand RNA genome of about
11,000 nucleotides. The flaviviral genome encodes three struc-
tural proteins (capsid [C], premembrane/membrane [prM/M],
and envelope [E]) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1,
NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). The structural pro-
teins form viral particles. The nonstructural proteins participate
in viral replication, virion assembly, and evasion of the host im-
mune response (Lindenbach et al., 2013). Like ZIKV, many flavi-
viruses are significant human pathogens, including yellow fever
virus (YFV), West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus
(JEV), tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), and dengue virus
(DENV). ZIKV is transmitted by Aedes spp. mosquitoes, which
also transmit YFV and DENV, as well as chikungunya virus (an
emerging alphavirus). In addition, ZIKV may also be transmitted
through sex, blood transfusion, and organ transplantation, and
potentially through urine or saliva (Musso et al., 2014, 2015).
Individuals with compromised immunity could be more suscep-
tible to ZIKV infection and disease development (Shan et al.,
2016).
Since its first isolation in Uganda in 1947 (Dick et al., 1952),
ZIKV has predominantly been associated with sylvatic transmis-
sion cycles between primates and arboreal mosquitoes in for-
ests and has for six decades rarely caused human diseases,
with only 13 naturally acquired cases reported (Petersen et al.,
2016). Up to 80% of infected people are asymptomatic. Signs
and symptoms of ZIKV infection include fever, lethargy, conjunc-
tivitis, rash, and arthralgia. However, in the past decade, ZIKV
has emerged into urban transmission cycles between humans
and mosquitoes in the South Pacific and the Americas, and
has caused severe diseases, including Guillain-Barre
´ syndrome
and congenital microcephaly (Fauci and Morens, 2016). Phylo-
genetic analysis indicates ZIKV exists as African and Asian line-
ages. The Asian lineage is responsible for the recent/current
epidemics: it caused an epidemic on Yap Island, Micronesia, in
2007; it then spread from an unknown source, probably in South-
east Asia, to French Polynesia and other regions of the South
Pacific and caused large epidemics in 2013–2014; subse-
quently, ZIKV arrived in the Americas in 2015 and led to millions
of human infections. It is currently not known what has trig-
gered the surge of recent epidemics and severe diseases.

 Experimental systems, including a reverse genetic system of
ZIKV, animal models, and mosquito transmission models, are
urgently needed to address these key scientific questions. For
animal models, A129 (lacking interferon a/b receptors), AG129
(lacking interferon a/b and g receptors), and Irf3�/� Irf5�/�
Irf7�/� triple knockout mice were recently reported to be suscep-
tible to ZIKV infection and to develop neurological diseases (Laz-
ear et al., 2016; Rossi et al., 2016; Zmurko et al., 2016); infection
of rhesus macaques with an Asian lineage ZIKV was also re-
ported recently (Dudley et al., 2016). For mosquito infection,
one study showed that A. aegypti and A. albopictus mosquitoes
are unexpectedly poor vectors for ZIKV, with disseminated infec-
tion rates generally <50% following high-titer (107 tissue culture
infectious dose 50%) oral doses. This suggests the possibility
that other mosquito vectors or human-to-human transmission
may be contributing to the explosive spread of the virus
(Chouin-Carneiro et al., 2016).
Here we report the construction and characterization of a sta-
ble full-length cDNA clone of a clinical, Asian lineage ZIKV strain
that could be used to make mutant viruses at any locations of the
viral genome. The cDNA clone-derived ZIKV was virulent and
caused neurological disease in A129 and AG129 mice. In addi-
tion, the recombinant virus was highly infectious for A. aegypti
mosquitoes. Furthermore, the infectious cDNA clone could be
used to generate a luciferase reporter ZIKV for antiviral drug dis-
covery. These experimental systems are essential to study viral
pathogenesis and vector transmission as well as to develop a
ZIKV vaccine and therapeutics.
RESULTS
Construction of the Full-Length cDNA Clone of ZIKV
We chose a clinical ZIKV isolate of Asian lineage to construct
the cDNA clone. This ZIKV strain (FSS13025) was isolated
from a 3-year-old patient from Cambodia in 2010 (Heang
et al., 2012). Viral RNA from Vero cell passage two of the
isolate was sequenced (GenBank number KU955593.1) and
used as the template to construct the infectious cDNA clone.
Five RT-PCR fragments (A–E) spanning the complete viral
genome were individually cloned and assembled into the full-
length cDNA of ZIKV (named as pFLZIKV; Figure 1A). Based
on our previous experience with infectious clones of other fla-
viviruses (Li et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2002; Zou et al., 2011), we
chose a low-copy number plasmid pACYC177 (15 copies per
E. coli cell) to clone fragments A and B as well as to assemble
the full-genome cDNA. This plasmid was used because frag-
ments A and B, spanning the viral prM-E-NS1 genes, were
toxic to E. coli during the cloning procedure; high copy-num-
ber vectors containing these fragments were unstable, leading
to aberrant deletions/mutations of the inserts (Shi et al., 2002).
In contrast, fragments C, D, and E were not toxic to E. coli and
could be cloned individually into a high copy-number plasmid
pCR2.1-TOPO. A T7 promoter and a hepatitis delta virus ribo-
zyme (HDVr) sequence were engineered at the 50 and 30 ends
of the complete viral cDNA for in vitro transcription and for
generation of the authentic 30 end of the RNA transcript,
respectively. Sequence comparison of the fully assembled
pFLZIKV cDNA with the parental virus revealed two synony-
mous mutations in the E gene (Table 1), one of which was
derived from an engineered genetic marker (see below). The
complete DNA sequence of pFLZIKV is shown in Sup-
plemental Experimental Procedures, available online. RNA
synthesized from the pFLZIKV plasmid (10,807 nt long without
HDVr) and RNA transcribed from a DENV-2 infectious clone
(10,723 nt long; Zou et al., 2011) migrated similarly on a native
agarose gel (Figure 1B).
RNA Transcript from ZIKV cDNA Clone Is Infectious
We transfected the pFLZIKV RNA transcript into Vero cells to
examine the infectivity of the cDNA clone. The transfected cells
were monitored for viral protein expression, RNA synthesis, and
virus production. As shown in Figure 1C, an increasing number of
cells expressed viral E protein from day 3 to day 6 post-transfec-
tion (p.t.). RT-PCR analysis detected ZIKV RNA in culture media
of the transfected cells; as a negative control, no RT-PCR prod-
uct was detected from the cells transfected with an RNA contain-
ing the polymerase active site GDD residues mutated to AAA
(Figure 1D). Increasing amounts of infectious virus were pro-
duced from the wild-type RNA-transfected cells, with peak titers
of 1 3 106–7 plaque-forming units (PFUs)/ml on days 5–7 (Fig-
ure 1E). On days 6–7 p.t., the transfected cells exhibited cyto-
pathic effects (CPE; Figure 1F). Full-genome sequencing of the
recombinant virus revealed no change other than the two synon-
ymous mutations that originated from pFLZIKV. Collectively,
these results demonstrate that the ZIKV cDNA clone is
infectious.
Comparison of Cell Culture Growth between Parental
and Recombinant Viruses
We compared the recombinant and parental viruses in cell cul-
ture. As shown in Figure 2A, the recombinant virus produced ho-
mogeneous plaque morphology, whereas the parental virus
generated heterogeneous plaque sizes. The difference in plaque
morphology was not surprising, because the recombinant vi-
ruses were derived from a homogenous population of RNA tran-
scripts, whereas the parental virus presumably was composed
of a quasispecies. In agreement with this notion, the recombi-
nant virus displayed attenuated replication kinetics in both
mammalian Vero and mosquito C6/36 cells (Figures 2B and
2C), indicating that the replication level of recombinant virus
was attenuated in cell culture.
Recombinant ZIKV Retained an Engineered Genetic
Marker
To exclude the possibility that the recovered recombinant virus
represented contamination with the parental virus, we engi-
neered a genetic marker into the recombinant virus, in which
an SphI cleavage site in the E gene from the parental virus
was eliminated (Figure 2D). A 1,250 bp fragment spanning nu-
cleotides 1,303–2,552 of viral genome was amplified using
RT-PCR from RNAs extracted from the parental and recombi-
nant viruses. The RT-PCR product from the parental virus was
readily cleaved by SphI, whereas the RT-PCR product from
the recombinant virus was resistant to SphI digestion (Figure 2E).
These results demonstrate that the recombinant virus was pro-
duced from the cDNA-derived RNA transcript. The genetic
marker allows differentiation and quantification between the re-
combinant virus and potentially other ZIKV isolates (which have
892

 the SphI site); it could be used to study viral fitness when the
recombinant virus serves as an internal standard to gauge viral
fitness of other ZIKV strains in a competition assay (Fitzpatrick
et al., 2010).
The Infectious cDNA Clone of ZIKV Is Stable
Since infectious cDNA clones of flaviviruses are known to be
unstable and deleterious for bacterial host (Khromykh and West-
away, 1994; Lai et al., 1991; Mandl et al., 1997; Rice et al., 1989;
Figure 1. Construction of the Infectious cDNA Clone of ZIKV
(A) The strategy for constructing the full-length cDNA clone of ZIKV. Genome organization, unique restriction sites, and their nucleotide positions are shown. Five
cDNA fragments from A to E (represented by thick lines) were synthesized from genomic RNA using RT-PCR to cover the complete ZIKV genome. Individual
fragments were assembled to form the full-length cDNA clone of ZIKV (pFLZIKV). The complete ZIKV cDNA is positioned under the control of T7 promoter
elements for in vitro transcription. An HDVr ribozyme sequence was engineered at the 30 end of viral genome to generate an authentic 30 end of viral RNA
sequence. The numbers are the nucleotide positions based on the sequence of ZIKV strain FSS13025 (GenBank: KU955593.1).

genome-length DENV-2 RNA.
(C) IFA of viral protein expression in cells transfected with full-length ZIKV RNA. Vero cells were electroporated with 10 mg of genome-length ZIKV RNA. From day
3 to day 6 p.t., IFA was performed to examine viral E protein expression using a mouse mAb (4G2). Green and blue represent E protein and nuclei (stained with
DAPI), respectively.

primer pair 1303-F and 2552-ClaI-R (Table S2). As a negative control, a genome-length RNA containing an NS5 polymerase active site mutation (GDD mutated to
AAA) was included.

 Sumiyoshi et al., 1992), we examined the stability of pFLZIKV
through five rounds of plasmid transformation, bacterial growth,
and plasmid purification. Plasmid purified from round five was
used to transcribe RNA for an infectivity testing. Transfection
of the fifth round RNA into Vero cells generated viral E protein-
expressing cells (Figure S1A) and infectious virus (Figure S1B)
at levels equivalent to those derived from the original pFLZIKV
RNA without passaging (Figures S1A and S1B). Similar plaque
morphology was observed for the original and fifth-round RNA-
derived recombinant viruses (Figure S1C). These results demon-
strate the stability of the ZIKV infectious clone.
Virulence in A129 and AG129 Mice
We compared the virulence of the parental and recombinant
ZIKVs in two mouse models: A129 (lacking interferon a/b recep-
tor) and AG129 (lacking interferon a/b and g receptors). The
AG129 mice have recently been reported to be more susceptible
to ZIKV-induced disease than the A129 mice (Rossi et al., 2016).
In the A129 mice, intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection with parental
virus (105 PFU) led to weight loss and disease characterized
by hunched posture and ruffled fur; all infected mice were
euthanized due to >20% weight loss on day 9 post-infection
(p.i.; Figure 3A). In contrast, infection with the same inoculum
of recombinant ZIKV resulted in less weight loss, but none of
the infected mice died (Figure 3A). In agreement with these ob-
servations, the recombinant virus generated significantly lower
viremia than the parental virus on day 1 p.i. in the A129 mice,
whereas the differences on day 2 and 3 viremia were not statis-
tically significant between the two viruses (Figure 3B). The results
suggest that the slower replication kinetics of the recombinant
virus may be responsible for its attenuated virulence.
In AG129 mice, i.p. injection of both parental and recombinant
ZIKVs (1 3 103–5 PFU) led to neurological disease, weight loss,
and death (due to >20% weight loss; Figure 4). The neurological
disease was characterized by hyperactivity, uncoordinated
movements, inability to right the body, body spinning, and
hindlimb paralysis. The kinetics of weight loss was dependent
on the viral dose: mice infected with the recombinant virus ex-
hibited slower weight loss and longer survival than those infected
with the parental virus (Figure 4). These results demonstrate that
the recombinant virus is less virulent than the parental virus
in vivo; however, infection of AG129 mice with the recombinant
virus still leads to neurological disease. Therefore, the infectious
cDNA clone could be used for mutagenesis analysis to identify
potential viral virulent determinants.
Mosquito Infection and Dissemination
To compare viral fitness between parental and recombinant
viruses in mosquitoes, we determined the oral susceptibility of
A. aegypti using artificial human blood meals containing ZIKV.
On day 14 post-feeding, engorged mosquitos were analyzed
for the presence of virus in the bodies and legs to indicate viral
infection rate and dissemination rate, respectively. As summa-
rized in Table 2, the recombinant virus showed higher infection
and disseminated infection rates than the parental virus, which
may have reflected the slightly higher blood meal titer of the
recombinant virus. The overall dissemination rates (number of
disseminated mosquitoes / number of infected mosquitoes 3
100%) were equivalent between the parental and recombinant
viruses, suggesting that the recombinant virus has a wild-type
phenotype in A. aegypti mosquitoes. These results demonstrate
that the recombinant virus is highly infectious for A. aegypti, and
the disseminated infection rates suggest that this species is an
efficient vector for ZIKV.
A Luciferase Reporter ZIKV for Antiviral Drug Discovery
To demonstrate the utility of the reverse genetic system, we en-
gineered a Renilla luciferase (Rluc) gene into the infectious cDNA
clone. The Rluc gene was inserted at the viral capsid coding
sequence (Figure 5A), as previously reported for YFV (Shustov
et al., 2007). Transfection of the genome-length Rluc ZIKV RNA
into Vero cells generated robust luciferase signals (Figure S2A).
Infection of Vero cells using culture medium from the transfected
cells produced luciferase activities (Figure S2B), indicating that
infectious reporter ZIKV had been produced. The reporter virus
could not be detected using plaque assay (even after incubating
the infected cells for 6 days p.i.; data not shown) but could
be clearly detected using an immunostaining focus assay (Fig-
ure 5B), indicating that insertion of the luciferase gene attenu-
ated viral replication.
Using a known panflavivirus inhibitor (nucleoside analog
NITD008; Lo et al., 2016; Yin et al., 2006), we examined whether
the reporter ZIKV could be used for antiviral testing. As shown in
Figure 5C, treatment of Rluc ZIKV-infected cells with NITD008
exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of the luciferase signals;
the luciferase inhibition suggested an EC50 value of 2.5 mM. No
cytotoxicity was observed up to 100 mM of the inhibitor (Fig-
ure 5C). To validate the antiviral activity derived from the reporter
virus, we performed viral titer reduction assay to estimate the
compound efficacy against wild-type ZIKV (Figure 5D). The viral
titer reduction results suggested an EC50 value of 3.6 mM, which
is comparable to the EC50 value derived from the reporter virus
system. Collectively, the results demonstrate that a luciferase
reporter ZIKV could be used for antiviral drug screening.
DISCUSSION
Our reverse genetic system, together with the mosquito infec-
tion and A129/AG129 mouse models, provide a tractable plat-
form to explore the mechanisms responsible for the explosive
epidemics and increased disease severity of ZIKV infection
since 2007. A number of nonexclusive
mechanisms are
possible. (1) ZIKV has undergone adaptive evolution that
enhanced mosquito transmission, leading to rapid virus spread
and an increased number of human infections. This hypothesis
could be tested by comparisons of mosquito infectivity of the
older ZIKV strains with recent isolates, followed by using the
reverse genetic system to test the effects of recent mutations

 on mosquito transmission. This mechanism was responsible for
the emergence of Chikungunya virus, in which a series of muta-
tions in the viral envelope genes enhanced viral transmission by
A. albopictus through increased infection of epithelial cells in the
midgut (Tsetsarkin et al., 2014; Tsetsarkin and Weaver, 2011).
(2) The Asian lineage of ZIKV has adapted to generate higher
viremia in humans, leading to enhanced crossplacental infection
and microcephaly. This hypothesis could be tested by engineer-
ing adaptive mutations from the recent isolates into the infec-
tious cDNA clone, generating mutant viruses, and quantifying
the mutational effect on viral virulence in the A129/AG129
mouse and on microcephaly development. (3) Stochastic intro-
duction of ZIKV into a population (in the Pacific and Americas)
lacking herd immunity led to greater susceptibility to ZIKV infec-
tion and efficient mosquito transmission. Seroprevalence and
its correlation with ZIKV transmission and outbreak frequency

SphI site was amplified using RT-PCR from RNA extracted from either recombinant virus or parental virus. The RT-PCR fragments were subjected to SphI
digestion. The 1,250 bp fragment derived from recombinant virus should not be cleavable by SphI, whereas the RT-PCR fragment amplified from parental viral
RNA should be cleavable by SphI. The expected sizes of the digestion products are indicated.

 need to be established to address this hypothesis. (4) Previous
infection with DENV may exacerbate ZIKV disease severity
because the two viruses share high amino acids identity and
extensive antibody crossreactivity (Alkan et al., 2015; Lanciotti
et al., 2008). This hypothesis could be tested in the AG129
mouse because this mouse is susceptible to both DENV and
ZIKV infections. (5) Human genetic predisposition may account
for the severe disease outcomes. Any viral infection is modu-
lated by proviral and antiviral host factors. The interaction
between viral and host factors determines the efficiency of
infection, pathogenicity, transmission, and epidemic potential.
Therefore, variations of critical host factor(s) among infected
individuals may contribute to different disease severity.
Compared with the parental virus, the replication efficiency
of the recombinant virus was reduced in Vero and C6/36 cells
(Figure 2). This attenuated replication of recombinant virus in
Vero cells was translated to the attenuated virulence in the
A129 and AG129 mice (Figures 3 and 4). The differences (in repli-
cation and virulence) between the parental and recombinant
viruses might be due to the limited genetic heterogeneity of the
recombinant virus population and the more genetically diverse
quasispecies nature of the parental virus. It should be noted
that an alternative infectious cloning approach could be used
to generate quasispecies of virus that reflect parental virus pop-
ulation (Edmonds et al., 2013; Siridechadilok et al., 2013); the
virulence of the viruses derived from the two infectious cloning
approaches (the alternative approach and the current approach
described in this study) could be compared in the AG129 mouse
model. For mosquito experiments, although the replication of
the recombinant virus was reduced in C6/36 cells, it yielded a
disseminated infection rate in A. aegypti mosquitoes similar to
that of the parental virus, indicating that the cell culture system
does not necessarily recapitulate in vivo outcomes. Such a
discrepancy is not surprising because of the more complex
host-virus interactions in vivo.
Figure 4. Virulence of Parental and Recom-
binant ZIKVs in AG129 Mice
Six-week-old AG129 mice were inoculated by
intraperitoneal injection with 1 3 105 PFU (n = 4 for
parental virus; n = 5 for recombinant virus), 1 3 104
PFU (n = 8 for parental virus; n = 5 for recombinant
virus), or 1 3 103 PFU (n = 4 for parental virus;
n = 5 for recombinant virus) of ZIKV. The infected
mice were monitored for weight loss. Mice were
euthanized once weight loss exceeded >20%.
For each infection dose, weight loss and survival
curves are presented. Parental and recombinant
viruses and their infection doses are indicated.
Values are mean percent weight compared to

The infectious cDNA clone of ZIKV will
facilitate vaccine development through
rational
design.
Target-based
attenu-
ation of ZIKV could be achieved through
mutating viral replication components
(viral
RNA
and
replication
complex)
or through ablating viral components
needed for evasion of host immune
response (Li et al., 2013; Whitehead et al., 2007; Zu
¨ st et al.,
2013). The ZIKV strain used in the current study is appropriate
for such attenuated vaccine because of its high sequence
similarity to the American epidemic strains. As summarized in
Table S1, only 19 amino acid differences were observed be-
tween our infectious clone-derived virus and strains recently
isolated from microcephaly fetuses (Calvet et al., 2016; Faria
et al., 2016; Mlakar et al., 2016), representing >99% amino
acid identity. In addition, the recombinant virus was attenuated
in both A129 and AG129 mice yet replicated robustly in Vero cells
(an approved cell line for vaccine production) to titers above 1 3
106 PFU/ml. Besides its application for vaccine development,
the infectious clone could also be used to generate reporter
ZIKV, which would facilitate the tracking of viral replication in vivo
and screening for antiviral inhibitors in a high-throughput manner
(Shan et al., 2016). Indeed, we showed that a luciferase reporter
ZIKV could be generated; such a reporter virus could be used for
antiviral drug screening.
In summary, the current study has provided a multicomponent
platform to study ZIKV transmission and disease pathogenesis
and to develop countermeasures.

cillin/streptomycin at 28�C with 5% CO2. The parental ZIKV Cambodian strain
FSS13025 (GenBank number KU955593.1) was isolated in 2010 from the
blood of a patient from Cambodia. The following antibodies were used in
this study: a mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4G2 crossreactive with flavi-
virus E protein (ATCC) and goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor
488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

 cDNA Synthesis and Cloning
Viral RNA from Vero cell passage two of ZIKV Cambodian strain FSS13025 was
sequenced. Specifically, viral RNA was extracted from viral stocks using QIAamp
Viral RNA Kits (QIAGEN). cDNA fragments covering the complete genome were
synthesized from genomic RNA using SuperScript III (RT)-PCR using primers
(Table S2) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). Figure 1A
depicts the scheme to clone and assemble the full genome of ZIKV. Plasmid
pACYC177 (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) was used to clone fragments
B and A+B.Plasmid pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) was used to clone individual frag-
ments C, D, and E. The full-length genomic cDNA was assembled using plasmid
pACYC177. Bacterial strain Top 10 (Invitrogen) was used as the E. coli host for
construction and propagation of cDNA clones. A standard cloning procedure
was used, as previously reported for making WNV (Shi et al., 2002) and DENV
(Zou et al., 2011) infectious clones. The virus-specific sequence of each interme-
diate clone was validated by Sanger DNA sequencing before it was used in sub-
sequent cloning steps. The final plasmid containing full-length cDNA of ZIKV
(pFLZIKV) was sequenced to ensure no undesired mutations. A T7 promoter
and a HDVr sequence were engineered at the 50 and 30 ends of the complete viral
cDNA using overlap RT-PCR for in vitro transcription and for generation of the
authentic 30 end ofthe RNA transcript, respectively.TheAllrestrictionendonucle-
ases were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA).
Construction of Renilla Luciferase Reporter Virus
An overlap cloning strategy was used to construct ZIKV-Rluc plasmid. First, a
standard overlap PCR was used to create a cassette containing ‘‘NotI-T7 pro-
moter-50UTR-the first 25 amino acids of capsid protein-Renilla luciferase
gene-FMDV 2A-authentic initiation codon of capsid protein to the unique AvrII
site in E protein.’’ Briefly, fragment A covering ‘‘NotI-T7 promoter-50UTR-
the first 25 amino acids’’ was amplified with the primers pACYC-14437-F
and C25-Rluc-R using the pFLZIKV as a template. Renilla luciferase gene
(fragment B) was amplified from Dengue-Rluc reporter virus by primers C25-
Rluc-F and 2A-Cap-R. Fragment C spanning ‘‘the authentic initiation codon
of capsid protein to AvrII unique site in E protein’’ (located at nucleotide posi-
tion 1,533 of the viral genome) was amplified with primers 2A-Cap-F and
1818-R using the pFLZIKV as a template. Next, fragments A, B, and C were
used to create cassette ‘‘NotI-T7 promoter-50UTR-the first 25 amino acids of
capsid protein-renilla luciferase gene-FMDV2A-authentic initiation codon of
capsid protein to the unique AvrII site in E protein’’ by overlap PCR with primers
pACYC-14437-F and 1818C. All primer sequences are listed in Table S2.
Compared with the wild-type pFLZIKV, ZIKV-Rluc contained an extra fragment
(representing the first 25 amino acids of C protein-a Renilla luciferase gene-
FMDV2A) between the 50UTR and the complete ORF of the viral genome. Silent
mutations within the flavivirus-cyclization sequence (located in the amino
acids 14–17 of the complete capsid gene) were engineered. All the constructs
were verified by DNA sequencing.
RNA Transcription and Transfection
Plasmid pFLZIKV, containing the full-length cDNA of ZIKV, was amplified in
E. coli Top10 and purified using MaxiPrep PLUS (QIAGEN). For in vitro tran-
scription, 10 mg of pFLZIKV was linearized with restriction enzyme ClaI. The
linearized plasmid was extracted with phenol-chloroform and chloroform,
precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in 15 ml of RNase-free water
(Ambion, Austin, TX). The mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion) was used to
in vitro transcribe RNA in a 20 ml reaction with an additional 1 ml of 30 mM
GTP solution. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37�C for 2 hr, followed
by the addition of DNase I to remove the DNA template. The RNA was precip-
itated with lithium chloride, washed with 70% ethanol, resuspended in RNase-
free water, quantitated by spectrophotometry, and stored at �80�C in ali-
quots. For transfection, approximately 10 mg of RNA was electroporated to
8 3 106 Vero cells in 0.8 ml of Ingenio Electroporation Solution (Mirus, Madi-
son, WI), in 4 mm cuvettes with the GenePulser apparatus (Bio-Rad) at settings
of 0.45 kV and 25 mF, pulsing three times, with 3 s intervals. After a 10 min re-
covery at room temperature, the transfected cells were mixed with media and
incubated in a T-175 flask (5% CO2 at 37�C). At different time points p.t.,
recombinant viruses in cell culture media were harvested, clarified by centrifu-
gation at 500 3 g, stored in aliquots at �80�C, and subjected to analysis.
Indirect Immunofluorescence Assays
Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was performed to detect viral protein
expression in ZIKV RNA-transfected Vero cells. Vero cells transfected with
viral RNA were grown in an 8-well Lab-Tek chamber slide (Thermo Fisher Sci-
entific, Waltham, MA). At indicated time points, the cells were fixed in 100%
methanol at �20�C for 15 min. After 1 hr incubation in a blocking buffer con-
taining 1% FBS and 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS, the cells were treated with a
mouse monoclonal antibody 4G2 for 1 hr and washed three times with PBS
(5 min for each wash). The cells were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488
goat anti-mouse IgG for 1 hr in blocking buffer, after which the cells were
washed three times with PBS. The cells were mounted in a mounting medium
with DAPI (40, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Vector Laboratories, Inc.). Fluores-
cence images were observed under a fluorescence microscope equipped with
a video documentation system (Olympus).
Luciferase Assay
The Vero cells transfected with ZIKV-Rluc RNA (30 mg) were seeded in a
12-well plate. At various time points, the cells were washed once with PBS
and lysed using cell lysis buffer (Promega). The cells were scraped from plates
and stored at �80�C. Once samples for all time points had been collected,
luciferase signals were measured in a luminescence microplate reader
(PerkinElmer) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Antiviral Assays
Two types of antiviral assays were performed: luciferase reporter ZIKV infec-
tion assay and wild-type ZIKV-based viral titer resection assay. For luciferase
reporter ZIKV assay, Vero cells were seeded at 2 3 104 cells per well in 96-well
plates. After incubation overnight, the cells were infected with the reporter
virus at an MOI of 0.1 in the presence of compound NITD008. At 48 hr p.i., lucif-
erase activity was measured using Enduren, and cell viability was estimated in
an MTS assay as previously described (Wang et al., 2009). For viral titer reduc-
tion assay, Vero cells were infected with the recombinant wild-type ZIKV at an
MOI of 0.05. The infected cells were treated with different concentrations of
NITD008. At 48 hr p.i., the amount of infectious viruses in culture fluids was
quantified using plaque assay on Vero cells. Compound NITD008 was gener-
ously provided by Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases.
Restriction Enzyme Digestion Analysis to Differentiate between
Parental and Recombinant Viruses
A restriction endonuclease site for SphI existing in the parental ZIKV was
eliminated in the cDNA clone and the resulting recombinant virus. The

 disappearance of the SphI site was used to distinguish between the parental
(with SphI site) and recombinant (without SphI site) viruses. Recombinant virus
(harvested from culture media on day 6 p.t.) and parental virus were subjected
to RNA extraction using QIAamp Viral RNA Kits (QIAGEN). The extracted viral
RNAs were used to amplify the 1,250 bp fragments spanning the SphI site us-
ing primers E-1303V and NS1-2552-ClaI-R (Table S2). The RT-PCR products
were digested with SphI and analyzed on a 0.8% agarose gel.
Plaque Assay
Viral samples were 10-fold serially diluted six times in DMEM. For each dilu-
tion, 100 ml sample was added to a 12-well plate containing Vero cells at about
90% confluency. The infected cells were incubated for 1 hr and swirled every
15 min to ensure complete coverage of the monolayer for even infection. After
the incubation, 1 ml of methyl cellulose overlay containing 5% FBS and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin was added to each well, and the plate was incubated
at 37�C for 4 days. Following the incubation, methyl cellulose overlay was
removed; the plate was washed twice with PBS, fixed with 3.7% formalde-
hyde, and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. After removing the fixa-
tive, the plate was stained with 1% crystal violet for 1 min. Visible plaques were
counted, and viral titers (PFU/ml) were calculated.
Replication Curves
Subconfluent Vero and C6/36 cells in 12-well plates were inoculated with
either parental or recombinant ZIKV at an MOI of 0.01 in triplicate wells. Virus
stocks were diluted in DMEM containing 5% FBS and 1% penicillin/strepto-
mycin. One hundred microliters of virus was added to each well of the
12-well plates. After 1 hr attachment (5% CO2 at 37�C for Vero cells and at
28�C for C6/36 cells), the inocula were removed. The cell monolayers were
washed three times with PBS. Afterward, 1 ml DMEM medium containing
2% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin was added to each well. The plates
were incubated for up to 6 days. The medium was collected daily and sub-
jected to plaque assay as described above.
Virulence in Mice
Both A129 and AG129 mice were used to examine the virulence of parental
and recombinant ZIKVs. The details of parental ZIKV infection in A129 mice
have been recently reported (Rossi et al., 2016). Briefly, 4-week-old A129
mice were infected with 1 3 105 PFU via the intraperitoneal route. Five mice
per group were used for parental and recombinant viruses. PBS was used to
dilute the virus stocks to the desired concentration. The inoculum was back-
titrated to verify the viral dose. Mock-infected mice were given PBS by the
same route. Mice were weighed and monitored daily for signs of illness
(hunched posture, ruffled fur, lethargy, etc.). Mice were bled via the retro-
orbital sinus (RO) after being anesthetized every other day. Blood was clarified
post-collection by centrifugation at 3,380 3 g for 5 min and immediately stored
at �80�C for storage. Viral titers were determined by plaque assay on Vero
cells. Mice were considered moribund if they did not respond to stimuli,
were unable to remain upright, or lost 20% or more of their initial weight
(consistent with the approved protocol).
The AG129 mice were bred and maintained in animal facilities at the Univer-
sity of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). Young adult animals (6 weeks old) were
inoculated by intraperitoneal injection with parental or recombinant ZIKV using
a range of inocula. Following inoculation, mice were weighed daily and visually
monitored to determine the course of infection. Mice exhibiting weight loss
of >20% of initial body weight or neurologic disease were euthanized. Eutha-
nized animals were counted as being dead on the following day for analysis. All
animal work was completed in compliance with the UTMB policy as approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Figure 5. Construction of Reporter ZIKV for
Antiviral Testing
(A) Construction of a Renilla luciferase (Rluc) re-
porter ZIKV. The luciferase gene was in-frame
fused downstream of the first 25 amino acids of
the vial capsid gene (indicated as ‘‘C25’’); main-
taining these 25 amino acids of capsid is essential
for flavivirus genome cyclization required for viral
replication. The 2A peptide from foot-and-mouth
disease virus (indicated as ‘‘2A’’) was engineered
between the C terminus of luciferase gene and
the complete open reading frame of ZIKV; the 2A
sequence enables cleavage between the C termi-
nus of luciferase and the N terminus of the down-
stream capsid protein. Silent mutations within the
flavivirus-cyclization sequence (located in amino
acids 14–17 of the complete capsid gene) were
engineered; the mutated nucleotides are indicated
in red.
(B) Plaque morphology of the recombinant ZIKV
and immunostaining foci of the Rluc ZIKV. Plaque
assay was performed for the wild-type ZIKV on
day 4 p.i. The Rluc ZIKV did not generate clear
plaques (data not shown) but could be detected by
immunostaining on day 6 p.i.
(C) Antiviral test using the reporter ZIKV. Vero cells
were infected with the reporter ZIKV and treated
with a panflavivirus nucleoside inhibitor NITD008
(Yin et al., 2009). At 48 hr p.i., the cells were
measured for luciferase activities. An estimated
EC50 value of 2.5 mM is indicated for NITD008.
(D) Anti-ZIKV activity of NITD008 using viral titer
reduction assay. Vero cells were infected with wild-
type ZIKV at an MOI of 0.05 in the presence of
various concentrations of NITD008. At 48 hr p.i.,
viral titers in culture fluids were quantified using
plaque assay. The viral titer reduction results sug-
gest an EC50 value of 3.6 mM.

 Experimental Infection of Mosquitoes with ZIKV
A. aegypti colony mosquitoes derived from Galveston, TX, were fed for 30 min
on blood meals consisting of 1% (weight/vol) sucrose, 20% (vol/vol) FBS,
5 mM ATP, 33% (vol/vol) PBS-washed human blood cells (UTMB Blood
Bank), and 33% (vol/vol) DMEM medium and combined with 1 ml virus offered
in Hemotek 2-ml heated reservoirs (Discovery Workshops) covered with
a mouse skin. Virus titer in the blood meals ranged from 6.2 to 6.5 log10
FFU/ml.
Infectious
blood
meals
were
loaded
on
cartons
containing
A. aegypti. Engorged mosquitoes were incubated at 28�C, 80% relative
humidity on a 12:12 hr light:dark cycle with ad libitum access to 10% sucrose
solution for 14 days and then frozen at �20�C overnight. To assess infection
and dissemination, bodies and legs were individually homogenized (Retsch
MM300 homogenizer, Retsch Inc., Newton, PA) in DMEM with 20% FBS
and 250 mg/ml amphotericin B. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at
5,000 rpm, and 50 ml of each sample supernatant was inoculated into
96-well plates containing Vero cells at 37�C and 5% CO2 for 3 days, when
they were fixed with a mixture of ice-cold acetone and methanol (1:1) solution
and immunostained as described below. Infection was determined by recov-
ery of virus from the homogenized body, and dissemination from the alimen-
tary track into the hemocoel was determined by recovery of virus from the
legs. The infection rate was recorded as the fraction of virus-positive bodies
divided by the total number of bodies from engorged mosquiteos, and the
disseminated infection rate is the number of virus-positive legs divided by
the total number of engorged mosquitoes.
Focus-Forming Assays and Immunostaining
Ten-fold serial dilutions of virus in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS and
250 mg/ml amphotericin B (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were added onto
confluent Vero cell monolayers attached to 96-well Costar (Corning, NY) plates
and incubated for 1 hr with periodic gentle rocking to facilitate virus adsorption
at 37�C. Wells were then overlaid with 150 ml of DMEM supplemented with
2% FBS and 250 mg/ml amphotericin B and incubated undisturbed for
3 days at 37�C. Media overlay was aspirated, and cell monolayers were rinsed
once with PBS (pH 7.4) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), fixed with a mixture of ice-
cold acetone and methanol (1:1) solution, and allowed to incubate for 30 min at
room temperature. Fixation solution was aspirated, and plates were allowed
to air dry. Plates were washed twice with PBS supplemented with 3% FBS, fol-
lowed by 1 hr incubation with ZIKV-specific HMAF (hyperimmune ascitic fluid).
Plates were washed thrice followed by an hour-long incubation with a second-
ary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD).
Detection proceeded with the addition of aminoethylcarbazole substrate
(ENZO Life sciences, Farmingdale, NY) prepared according to the vendor’s
instructions.
