Acne is one of the most common disorders treated by dermatologists and other health care
providers. While it most often affects adolescents, it is not uncommon in adults and can also be seen in
children. This evidence-based guideline addresses important clinical questions that arise in its
management. Issues from grading of acne to the topical and systemic management of the disease are
reviewed. Suggestions on use are provided based on available evidence. ( J Am Acad Dermatol
2016;74:945-73.)

DISCLAIMER
Adherence to these guidelines will not ensure
successful treatment in every situation. Furthermore,
these guidelines should not be interpreted as setting
a standard of care, or be deemed inclusive of all
proper methods of care, nor exclusive of other
methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining
the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding
the propriety of any specific therapy or technique
must be made by the physician and the patient in
light of all the circumstances presented by the
individual patient, and the known variability and
biologic behavior of the disease. This guideline
reflects the best available data at the time the
guideline was prepared. The results of future studies
may require revisions to the recommendations in this
guideline to reflect new data.
SCOPE
This guideline addresses the management of
adolescent and adult patients who present with
acne vulgaris (AV). This document will discuss
various acne treatments, including topical therapies,
systemic agents, and physical modalities, including

guideline development. If a potential conflict was
noted, the work group member recused him or
herself from discussion and drafting of recommen-
dations pertinent to the topic area of the disclosed
interest.
An evidence-based model was used and evidence
was obtained for the clinical questions (Table I)
using a systematic search of PubMed and the
Cochrane Library database from May 2006 through
September 2014 for clinical questions addressed in
the previous version of this guideline published in
2007, and 1964 to 2014 for all newly identified
clinical
questions.

Additional studies were identified by hand-searching
bibliographies of publications, including reviews
and metaanalyses.
A total of 1145 abstracts were initially assessed for
possible inclusion; 242 were retained for final review
based on relevancy and the highest level of available
evidence
for
the
outlined
clinical
questions.
Evidence tables were generated for these studies
and
used
by
the
work
group
in
developing
recommendations. In addition, the evidence tables
generated for the Academy’s previous acne guideline
were also used by the work group. The Academy’s
previous published guidelines on acne were also
evaluated,
as
were
other
current
published
guidelines on acne.1,2 Relevant references published

recommendations as derived from the systematic
search, and to address comments received during the
guideline review and approval process.
The available evidence was evaluated using a
unified
system
called
the
Strength
of
Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT) developed by
editors of the US family medicine and primary
care journals (ie, American Family Physician,
Family
Medicine,
Journal
of
Family
Practice,
and BMJ USA).3 Evidence was graded using a
3-point scale based on the quality of methodology
(eg,
randomized
control
trial,
case
control,
prospective/retrospective cohort, case series, etc)
and the overall focus of the study (ie, diagnosis,
treatment/prevention/screening, or prognosis) as
follows:
I. Good-quality
patient-oriented
evidence
(ie,
evidence measuring outcomes that matter to
patients:
morbidity,
mortality,
symptom
improvement, cost reduction, and quality of life).
II. Limited-quality patient-oriented evidence.
III. Other evidence, including consensus guide-
lines,
opinion,
case
studies,
or
disease-
oriented evidence (ie, evidence measuring
intermediate, physiologic, or surrogate end
points that may or may not reflect improve-
ments in patient outcomes).
Clinical recommendations were developed on the
best available evidence tabled in the guideline. The
strength of recommendation was ranked as follows:
A. Recommendation
based
on
consistent
and
good-quality patient-oriented evidence.
B. Recommendation based on inconsistent or
limited-quality patient-oriented evidence.
C. Recommendation based on consensus, opinion,
case studies, or disease-oriented evidence.
In those situations where documented evidence-
based data were not available or were showing
inconsistent or limited conclusions, expert opinion
and medical consensus was used to generate clinical
recommendations.

that time.
DEFINITION
AV is a chronic inflammatory dermatosis notable
for open or closed comedones (blackheads and
whiteheads) and inflammatory lesions, including
papules, pustules, or nodules (also known as cysts).
INTRODUCTION
Acne is a common skin disease, especially in
adolescents and young adults. Approximately 50
million people in the United States have AV.5 Acne
J AM ACAD DERMATOL
VOLUME 74, NUMBER 5
Zaenglein et al
947
 affects approximately 85% of teenagers, but can occur
in most age groups6 and can persist into adulthood.
The prevalence of acne in adult women is about 12%.7
There is no mortality associated with acne, but there
is
often
significant
physical
and
psychological
morbidity, such as permanent scarring, poor self-
image, depression, and anxiety. The direct cost of
the disease is estimated to exceed $3 billion per year.6
Acne is a multifactorial inflammatory disease
affecting the pilosebaceous follicles of the skin. The
current understanding of acne pathogenesis is
continuously evolving. Key pathogenic factors that
play an important role in the development of acne are
follicular hyperkeratinization, microbial colonization
with Propionibacterium acnes, sebum production,
and complex inflammatory mechanisms involving

Table II. Recommendations for grading and classification of acne
Clinicians may find it helpful to use a consistent grading/classification scale (encompassing the numbers and types of acne
lesions as well as disease severity, anatomic sites, and scarring) to facilitate therapeutic decisions and assess response to
treatment.
Currently, no universal acne grading/classifying system can be recommended.

 both innate and acquired immunity. In addition,
studies have suggested that neuroendocrine regula-
tory mechanisms, diet, and genetic and nongenetic
factors all may contribute to the multifactorial process
of acne pathogenesis. An algorithm for the treatment
and management of acne in adolescents and young
adults is shown in Fig 1.
SYSTEMS FOR THE GRADING AND
CLASSIFICATION OF ACNE
Acne grading systems may be useful in patient
care. Such systems can assist in more specific
classification of disease, help determine appropriate
treatment options, and monitor improvement during
the treatment course. Recommendations for grading
and classifying acne are shown in Table II, and the
strength
of
recommendations
for
grading
and
classifying acne is shown in Table III.
Numerous acne assessment tools have been
described, taking into account various factors, such
as type of acne, severity of acne, number of acne
lesions, anatomic location/extent of acne,8 quality of
life
and
other
psychosocial
metrics,9-13
and
scarring,14 among other measures.15-24 Recently, 18
of these grading scales were ranked based on a
variety of characteristics.25 To date, there is no
universally
agreed-upon
grading
system,
and
systems can differ greatly between studies. In
addition, interobserver reliability of these scales
varies, but has been poor in some studies.17,26,27
Methods such as photographic standards have been
used to improve reproducibility.
Improvements
in
digital
technology,
photo-
graphic equipment, and teledermatology may allow
for accurate, remote assessment of acne in the near
future.28-30 Scientific measures, such as ultraviolet-

future. Reproducibility, as well as ease of use and
acceptance by dermatologists, will be essential for
the success of any grading system.
MICROBIOLOGIC TESTING
P acnes, a Gram-positive anaerobic rod, is the
primary bacterium implicated in acne.40-42 It has
specific, nonstandard culture requirements that
prohibit routine culture. Currently, microbiologic
testing of acne lesions is largely unnecessary because
it does not affect management, and successful
antibiotic treatment may not result from a reduction
of bacterial numbers.40 The antibiotics typically used
in the management of acne, tetracyclines, have
additional antiinflammatory actions independent of
microbial
killing.
As
additional
information
is
learned about P acnes from a molecular and genetic
perspective, and its role in inciting inflammation in
acne,43-48 more targeted therapeutic interventions in
the
future
may
result.
Recommendations
for
microbiologic testing of acne are shown in Table IV
and
the
strength
of
recommendations
for
microbiologic testing is shown in Table III.
The prime situation where microbiologic testing is
useful
in
patients
with
acne
is
in
evaluating
for
Gram-negative
folliculitis.
This
uncommon
disorder presents as uniform and eruptive pustules,
with rare nodules, in the perioral and perinasal
regions,
typically
in
the
setting
of
prolonged
tetracycline use. It is caused by various bacteria,
such as Klebsiella and Serratia, and is unresponsive
to
many
conventional acne
treatments.
Gram-
negative folliculitis is typically diagnosed via culture
of
the
lesions,
and
is
generally
treated
with
isotretinoin or an antibiotic to which the bacteria
are sensitive. In cases of acne unresponsive to typical
treatmentsdparticularly
with
prominent
truncal
involvement
or
monomorphic
appearanced
pityrosporum
folliculitis
should
be
considered.
Staphylococcus aureus cutaneous infections may
appear similar to acne, and should be considered
in the differential, particularly in cases of acute
eruptions; a swab culture may be helpful in these
cases.
ENDOCRINOLOGIC TESTING
While the role of androgens in acne pathogenesis
is well known, endocrinologic evaluation is only
warranted in certain cases, because most acne
patients will have normal hormone levels. Testing
is primarily indicated for patients with clinical
features or a history of hyperandrogenism. In
prepubertal children, these features include: acne,
early-onset body odor, axillary or pubic hair,
accelerated growth, advanced bone age, and genital
maturation. Growth charts and a hand film for bone
age
are
good
screening
tools
before
specific
hormonal
testing.1,49
In
postpubertal
females,
clinical signs, such as infrequent menses, hirsutism,
androgenetic alopecia, infertility, polycystic ovaries,
clitoromegaly, and truncal obesity warrant further
hormonal testing.1,2,50-52,165 Recalcitrant acne caused
by androgen excess can also be seen in both men
and women with nonclassical congenital adrenal
hyperplasia (eg, 21-hydroxylase deficiency).166,167
Recommendations for endocrinologic testing of acne
are
shown
in Table IV, and
the strength
of
recommendations
for
endocrinologic
testing
is
shown in Table III.
The most common cause of elevated androgens of
ovarian
origin
is
polycystic
ovarian
syndrome
(PCOS).53 It has recently been proposed that
diagnosis of PCOS in adult females requires 2 of
the 3 following criteria: androgen excess (clinical or
biochemical),
ovulatory
dysfunction
(oligo-
or
anovulation),
or
polycystic
ovaries
(based
on
ultrasonographic findings). In adolescent females,
the diagnosis of PCOS can be made based on
hyperandrogenism (clinical or biochemical) in the
presence
of
persistent
oligomenorrhea.168
The
differential diagnosis of PCOS includes thyroid
disease,
prolactin
excess,
and
nonclassical
congenital adrenal hyperplasia, among others.168
Hormonal testing and interpretation of testing is
complex.
A
typical
hormone-screening
panel
includes free and total testosterone, dehydroepian-
drosterone
sulfate
(DHEA-S),
androstenedione,
luteinizing
hormone,
and
follicle-stimulating
hormone.49,51-54,165 Growth hormone, insulin-like
Table IV. Recommendations for microbiologic and endocrinologic testing
Routine microbiologic testing is not recommended in the evaluation and management of patients with acne
Those who exhibit acne-like lesions suggestive of Gram-negative folliculitis may benefit from microbiologic testing
Routine endocrinologic evaluation (eg, for androgen excess) is not recommended for the majority of patients with acne
Laboratory evaluation is recommended for patients who have acne and additional signs of androgen excess

severe acne.52,54-56,165,169 Insulin resistance may also
represent a risk factor for acne in certain patients.170
Patients with abnormal test results, or in whom there
is a persistent concern for a hormonal disorder,
should be further evaluated by an endocrinologist.
TOPICAL THERAPIES
The topical therapy of AV includes the usage of
agents that are available over the counter or via
prescription. Therapy choice may be influenced by
age of the patient, site of involvement, extent and
severity of disease, and patient preference. Topical
therapies
may
be
used
as
monotherapy,
in
combination
with
other
topical
agents
or
in
combination with oral agents in both initial control
and maintenance. Recommendations for use of
topical therapies are shown in Table V, and the
strength of recommendations for treatment of acne
with topical
therapies is shown in Table III.
Prescribing information for all topical therapies is
located
in
Supplementary
Tables
I-XIII.(Please
note all Supplemental Tables can be found at
www.jaad.org.)
Commonly used topical acne therapies include
BP, salicylic acid, antibiotics, combination antibiotics
with BP, retinoids, retinoid with BP, retinoid with
antibiotic, azelaic acid, and sulfone agents. Although
most physicians have anecdotal regimens they find
beneficial, agents reviewed here are limited to those
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for use in the United States, and for which
peer-reviewed literature has been published.
BP is an antibacterial agent that kills P acnes
through the release of free oxygen radicals and is
also mildly comedolytic.171,172 No resistance to this
agent has been reported, and the addition of BP to
regimens of antibiotic therapy enhances results and
may reduce resistance development. BP is available
as topical washes, foams, creams, or gels, and can
used as leave-on or wash-off agents. Strengths
available for acne therapy range from 2.5% to 10%.
BP therapy is limited by concentration-dependent
irritation, staining and bleaching of fabric, and
uncommon contact allergy. Total skin contact time
and formulation can also affect efficacy. Lower
concentrations
(eg,
2.5-5%),
water-based,
and
wash-off agents may be better tolerated in patients
with more sensitive skin.57,58 Results can be noted in
as soon as 5 days.59
Topical antibiotics for acne accumulate in the
follicle and have been postulated to work through
antiinflammatory mechanisms and via antibacterial
effects.60 These agents are best used in combination
with BP (wash-off or leave-on), which increases
efficacy and decreases the development of resistant
bacterial
strains.
Monotherapy
with
topical
antibiotics in the management of acne is not
recommended because of the development of
antibiotic resistance. Clindamycin 1% solution or
gel is currently the preferred topical antibiotic for
acne
therapy.173
Topical
erythromycin
in
2%
concentration is available as a cream, gel, lotion, or
pledget,61,62 but has reduced efficacy in comparison
with clindamycin because of resistance of cutaneous
Table V. Recommendations for topical therapies
Benzoyl peroxide or combinations with erythromycin or clindamycin are effective acne treatments and are recommended as
monotherapy for mild acne, or in conjunction with a topical retinoid, or systemic antibiotic therapy for moderate to severe
acne
Benzoyl peroxide is effective in the prevention of bacterial resistance and is recommended for patients on topical or
systemic antibiotic therapy
Topical antibiotics (eg, erythromycin and clindamycin) are effective acne treatments, but are not recommended as
monotherapy because of the risk of bacterial resistance
Topical retinoids are important in addressing the development and maintenance of acne and are recommended as
monotherapy in primarily comedonal acne, or in combination with topical or oral antimicrobials in patients with mixed or
primarily inflammatory acne lesions
Using multiple topical agents that affect different aspects of acne pathogenesis can be useful. Combination therapy should
be used in the majority of patients with acne
Topical adapalene, tretinoin, and benzoyl peroxide can be safely used in the management of preadolescent acne in children
Azelaic acid is a useful adjunctive acne treatment and is recommended in the treatment of postinflammatory
dyspigmentation
Topical dapsone 5% gel is recommended for inflammatory acne, particularly in adult females with acne
There is limited evidence to support recommendations for sulfur, nicotinamide, resorcinol, sodium sulfacetamide, aluminum
chloride, and zinc in the treatment of acne

 Staphylococci and P acnes.60,63-66 Stable, fixed-
combination agents are available with erythromycin
3%/BP 5%, clindamycin 1%/BP 5%, and clindamycin
1%/BP
3.75%.67-69,174
Combination
agents
may
enhance compliance with treatment regimens. Rare
reports of diarrhea or Clostridium difficileerelated
colitis with clindamycin topically have appeared in
the literature, but the risk appears low.66 Tolerance
of these agents is excellent; clindamycin alone is
pregnancy category B.
Topical retinoids are vitamin A derivatives that are
prescription agents with randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trials supporting their use for
acne treatment.70-72,175 Three active agents are
available: tretinoin (0.025-0.1% in cream, gel, or
microsphere gel vehicles), adapalene (0.1%, 0.3%
cream, or 0.1% lotion73,74), and tazarotene (0.05%,
0.1% cream, gel or foam). Each retinoid binds to a
different set of retinoic acid receptors: tretinoin to
alpha,
beta,
and
gamma,
and
tazarotene
and
adapalene, selectively, to beta and gammadthereby
conferring slight differences in activity, tolerability,
and efficacy. Retinoids are the core of topical
therapy for acne because they are comedolytic,
resolve the precursor microcomedone lesion, and
are antiinflammatory.
These agents enhance any topical acne regimen
and allow for maintenance of clearance after
discontinuation of oral therapy. Retinoids are ideal
for comedonal acne and, when used in combination
with other agents, for all acne variants. Three topical
agents
are
available
that
contain
retinoids
in
combination with other products: adapalene 0.1%/
BP 2.5%, approved for use in patients $9 years of
age,
and
2
agents
with
fixed
combination
clindamycin phosphate 1.2%/tretinoin 0.025% gel,
approved for patients $12 years of age.75,76,176
Retinoid use may be limited by side effects,
including dryness, peeling, erythema, and irritation,
which can be mitigated by reduced frequency
of application.177 Given any single agent, higher
concentrations may be more efficacious, but with
greater side effects.70,74,77 Some formulations of
tretinoin
(primarily
generic
products)
are
not
photostable and should be applied in the evening.
Tretinoin also may be oxidized and inactivated by
the coadministration of BP. It is recommended that
the 2 agents be applied at different times. Tretinoin
microsphere formulation, adapalene, and tazarotene
do not have similar restrictions. Topical retinoids
have been associated with an increased risk of
photosensitivity; concurrent daily sunscreen can be
used to reduce the risk of sunburn.
There are several head-to-head studies with
retinoid products. Some support greater efficacy of
tazarotene
over
adapalene
and
tretinoin,
and
adapalene over tretinoin, but the concentrations
and formulations used were varied.73,78-80 Data
suggest that adapalene is better tolerated than
multiple concentrations of tretinoin, but this is based
on older formulations.81 Overall, the limitations of
the
existing
studies
prohibit
direct
efficacy
comparisons of topical retinoids.
Tretinoin and adapalene are pregnancy category
C, while tazarotene is category X; therefore, patients
should be counseled on these pregnancy risks when
starting a retinoid or if a woman patient desires
pregnancy.
The therapy of acne in children \12 years of age
with products approved by the FDA has expanded.
Fixed combination BP 2.5%/adapalene 1% gel is
approved for patients $9 years of age, and tretinoin
0.05% micronized tretinoin gel for patients $10 years
of age. All other retinoids are approved by the FDA
for patients $12 years of age. Current data show that
retinoids in younger patients are effective and are not
associated with increased irritation or risk.

The sulfone agent, dapsone 5% gel, is available as
a twice-daily agent for the therapy of AV. In clinical
trials, topical dapsone showed modest to moderate
efficacy, primarily in the reduction of inflammatory
lesions.84,85 Combination with topical retinoids may
be indicated if comedonal components are present.
The mechanism of action is poorly understood, and
its ability to kill P acnes has been poorly studied. It is
generally thought to work as an antiinflammatory
agent. The benefit in women seems to exceed the
benefit
in
male
and
adolescent
patients.86,179
Topical dapsone may be oxidized by the coappli-
cation of BP, causing orange-brown coloration of
the skin which can be brushed or washed off.
Topical dapsone 5% gel is pregnancy category C
and has efficacy and safety data down to patients
12 years of age. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydroge-
nase testing is not required before starting topical
dapsone.
Salicylic acid is a comedolytic agent that is
available over the counter in 0.5% to 2% strengths
for the therapy of AV. Both wash-off and leave-on
preparations
are
well
tolerated.
Clinical

demonstrating the efficacy of salicylic acid in acne
are limited.87,180

 peer-reviewed literature supporting their efficacy is
lacking.181 Aluminum chloride possesses antibacte-
rial activity and, therefore, has been investigated in
the treatment acne. Of 2 peer-reviewed studies, 1
found benefit182 and 1 did not.183 Topical zinc alone
is ineffective.184-186 There is some evidence to
suggest the efficacy of sodium sulfacetamide.187-189
Topical niacinamide (nicotinomide) 2% to 4% gel is
available over the counter. The limited studies
available compare its efficacy to topical clindamycin

SYSTEMIC ANTIBIOTICS
Systemic antibiotics have been a mainstay of acne
treatment for years. They are indicated for use in
moderate to severe inflammatory acne and should be
used
in
combination
with
a
topical
retinoid
and BP.95,192,193 Evidence supports the efficacy of
tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, trimetho-
prim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), trimethoprim,
erythromycin,
azithromycin,
amoxicillin,
and
cephalexin.
Recommendations
for
systemic
antibiotics are shown in Table VI, and the strength
of recommendations for treatment of acne with
systemic
antibiotics
is
shown
in
Table
III.
Prescribing information for systemic antibiotics is
located in the Supplementary Tables XIV-XXII.
The tetracycline class of antibiotics should be
considered first-line therapy in moderate to severe
acne, except when contraindicated because of other
circumstances (ie, pregnancy, #8 years of age, or
allergy). The antibiotics of the tetracycline class work
by inhibiting protein synthesis by binding the 30S
subunit of the bacterial ribosome. This class also
has
notable
antiinflammatory
effects,
including
inhibiting chemotaxis and metalloproteinase activ-
ity. Previous guidelines recommended minocycline
as superior to doxycycline in reducing P acnes.1
However, a recent Cochrane review of clinical trials
found minocycline effective but not superior to other
antibiotics in the treatment of acne.88 There are few
studies addressing dosing of the tetracycline class.
Minocycline in an extended release form appears
safest (at 1 mg/kg), but no dose response was found
for efficacy.194 Doxycycline appears effective in the
1.7 to 2.4 mg/kg dose range.89 Subantimicrobial
dosing of doxycycline (ie, 20 mg twice daily to
40 mg daily) has also shown efficacy in patients with
moderate inflammatory acne.195,196
Erythromycin and azithromycin have also been
used in the treatment of acne. The mechanism of
action for the macrolide class of antibiotics is to bind
the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome. Again,
there are some antiinflammatory properties for these
medications, but the mechanisms are not well
understood.
Azithromycin
has
been
primarily
studied in the treatment of acne in open label studies
with different pulse dosing regimens ranging from 3
times a week to 4 days a month, with azithromycin
being an effective treatment in the time span
evaluateddusually 2 to 3 months.92,197-204 A recent
randomized controlled trial comparing 3 days per
month of azithromycin to daily doxycycline did
show superiority of doxycycline.205 Macrolides as
the penicillin class represent an alternative when
traditional antibiotics cannot be used.
TMP/SMX and trimethoprim have also been used
for the treatment of acne. Sulfamethoxazole is
bacteriostatic by blocking bacterial synthesis of folic
acid,
which
is
necessary
for
cell
division.
Trimethoprim is a folic acid analog that inhibits the
enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. The 2 agents work
together
to
block
nucleotide
and
amino
acid
synthesis in the bacteria. Outside of case reports,
there is 1 small, double-blind study showing that
TMP/SMX is as effective as oxytetracycline.93
Although data supporting their use are limited,
penicillins and cephalosporins are sometimes used
Table VI. Recommendations for systemic antibiotics
Systemic antibiotics are recommended in the management of moderate and severe acne and forms of inflammatory acne
that are resistant to topical treatments
Doxycycline and minocycline are more effective than tetracycline, but neither is superior to each other
Although oral erythromycin and azithromycin can be effective in treating acne, its use should be limited to those who
cannot use the tetracyclines (ie, pregnant women or children \8 years of age). Erythromycin use should be restricted
because of its increased risk of bacterial resistance
Use of systemic antibiotics, other than the tetracyclines and macrolides, is discouraged because there are limited data for
their use in acne. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim use should be restricted to patients who are unable
to tolerate tetracyclines or in treatment-resistant patients
Systemic antibiotic use should be limited to the shortest possible duration. Re-evaluate at 3-4 months to minimize the
development of bacterial resistance. Monotherapy with systemic antibiotics is not recommended
Concomitant topical therapy with benzoyl peroxide or a retinoid should be used with systemic antibiotics and for
maintenance after completion of systemic antibiotic therapy

 in the treatment of acne and can be used as an
alternative treatment when circumstances dictate. In
particular, these medications represent a useful
option in patients who may be pregnant or who
have allergies to the other classes of antibiotics.
These antibiotics work by binding the penicillin-
binding proteins in the bacterial cell membrane and
inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis. There are few
references to support the use of these medications in
the treatment of acne outside of case reports.
However, there is a small retrospective chart review
with cephalexin where the majority of patients
showed
some
clinical
improvement
on
this
medication.94
Adverse events of systemic therapy are often
a concern to patients and practitioners. However,
severe adverse effects of systemic antibiotics in the
treatment of acne are rare. Vaginal candidiasis and
drug eruptions can occur with any antibiotic.
Adverse events with the tetracycline class vary
with each medication. Photosensitivity can be seen
with the tetracycline class, doxycycline being more
photosensitizing than minocycline. Doxycycline is
more frequently associated with gastrointestinal
disturbances, and higher doses are more likely to
cause symptoms.89 Minocycline has been associated
with tinnitus, dizziness, and pigment deposition
of
the
skin,
mucous
membranes,
and
teeth.
Minocycline pigmentation is more common in
patients taking higher doses for longer periods of
time. Doxycycline is primarily metabolized by the
liver, and can be used safely in most patients with
renal impairment. When minocycline is compared to
other tetracyclines, more serious adverse events are
reported (8.8 cases per 100,000 patient years).88,90
The rare serious events associated with minocycline
include autoimmune disorders, such as drug reaction
with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS),
drug-induced
lupus,
and
other
hypersensitivity
reactions.91,206-209 Finally, pseudotumor cerebri is a
rare phenomenon associated with the tetracycline
class of antibiotics.
The
adverse
events
of
TMP/SMX
include
gastrointestinal upset, photosensitivity, and drug
eruptions. Multiple cutaneous reactions have been
observed with patients on this medication, the most
severe eruptions being StevenseJohnson syndrome
and toxic epidermal necrolysis.210,211 Such severe
eruptions are more common in patients with HIV.
The relative risk for such a severe reaction varies, but
is still a rare event, with studies citing the crude
relative risk at 172.211 Disorders of the hematopoietic
system
can
also
occur
with
TMP/SMX
and
can include serious blood dyscrasias, such as
neutropenia, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and
thrombocytopenia. Although these are rare adverse
events, patients on long-term therapy with this
medication should be periodically monitored with
a complete blood cell count. Cases of fulminant
hepatitis necrosis have also occurred in patients
taking this medication, as has respiratory hypersen-
sitivity. The concurrent use of TMP/SMX and
methotrexate (MTX) can be associated with severe
toxicity (Supplementary Table XVII).
The
macrolide
class
of
antibiotics
is
most
commonly associated with gastrointestinal distur-
bances. Erythromycin is associated with a higher
incidence
of
diarrhea,
nausea,
and abdominal
discomfort
than
azithromycin.
Macrolides
have
been
reported
to
cause
cardiac
conduction
abnormalities, and rarely hepatotoxicity has been
reported. Macrolide antibiotics can also decrease
metabolism of cyclosporine. Azithromycin has been
associated with cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions.
Penicillins and cephalosporins are most associ-
ated with the adverse events of hypersensitivity
reactions ranging from mild drug eruptions to
anaphylaxis.
Gastrointestinal
disturbances
are
also common and include nausea, diarrhea, and
abdominal distention and discomfort.
When prescribing systemic antibiotics, the issue
of bacterial resistance remains a major concern.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) has stressed antibiotic stewardship. This is
an initiative to promote the appropriate use of
antibiotics where patients receive the right dose of
the right antibiotic at the right time for the right
duration. Limiting antibiotic use to the shortest
possible duration, ideally 3-4 months, can be
accomplished with the concomitant use of a retinoid
Table VII. Recommendations for hormonal agents
Estrogen-containing combined oral contraceptives are effective and recommended in the treatment of inflammatory acne in
females
Spironolactone is useful in the treatment of acne in select females
Oral corticosteroid therapy can be of temporary benefit in patients who have severe inflammatory acne while starting
standard acne treatment
In patients who have well documented adrenal hyperandrogenism, low-dose oral corticosteroids are recommended in
treatment of acne

 or retinoid/BP.212,213 While limiting the use of
systemic antibiotics is necessary, the work group’s
consensus agrees there are a subset of patients for
whom alternative therapies are inappropriate and
who may require a longer course of antibiotics even
while taking topical medications. In such patients,
consistent follow-up and reevaluation should be
used to use the antibiotic for the shortest time
necessary. Monotherapy with oral antibiotics is
strongly
discouraged.
The
use
of
topical
maintenance regimens cannot be overemphasized.
Topical therapies can accomplish continued efficacy
months
after
the
discontinuation
of
systemic
antibiotics.95,96,212,214 The work group’s consensus
agrees that such maintenance is paramount to
reducing antibiotic resistance.215 Other attempts to
limit antibiotic use revolve around different dosing
recommendations,
such
as
pulse
dosing
and
submicrobial dosing. No alternate dosing routines
consistently appear superior to standard dosing.
Finally, limiting systemic antibiotic use is urged
because of the reported associations of inflammatory
bowel disease,97 pharyngitis,216 C difficile infec-
tion,217,218 and the induction of Candida vulvo-
vaginitis.
HORMONAL AGENTS
Combination oral contraceptive pills (COCs)
contain
both
an
estrogen
and
a
progestin
component. COCs were first approved by the FDA
for contraception in the United States in 1960.
They
prevent
ovulation
and
pregnancy
by
inhibiting gonadotropin-releasing hormone and,
subsequently, follicle-stimulating and luteinizing
hormones.
These
hormones
are
needed
to
begin
follicular
maturation
and
for
ovulation;
in
their
absence,
ovulation
does
not
occur.
Recommendations for hormonal agents are shown
in Table VII, and the strength of recommendations
for the treatment of acne with hormonal agents is
shown in Table III. World Health Organization
(WHO) recommendations for COC usage eligibility
are listed in Table VIII. Prescribing information for
hormonal therapies is located in Supplementary
Tables XXIII-XXVIII.
COCs have evolved since 1960. Ethinyl estradiol
levels have gradually decreased from around 50 to
150 �g per pill to as low as 10 �g. A variety of
different progestational moieties have been used,
beginning with the first-generation progestins, the
estranes
(ie,
norethindrone
and
ethynodiol
diacetate). Second-generation progestins include
levonorgestrel and norgestimate; these progestins
are referred to as the gonanes. Third-generation
progestins
include
less
androgenic
gonane
progestins, such as desogestrel and gestodene.
First-, second-, and third-generation progestins are
derived
from
testosterone
and
alone
have

 androgenic potential. Fourth-generation progestins
are not derived from testosterone and include the
antiandrogenic
progestin
drospirenone.
While
progestins
vary
in
their
androgenic
potential,
evidence
suggests
that
when
combined
with
ethinyl estradiol, the net effect of all COCs is
antiandrogenic.219,220
There are currently 4 COCs approved by the FDA
for the treatment of acne. They are ethinyl estradiol/
norgestimate,
ethinyl
estradiol/norethindrone
acetate/ferrous fumarate, ethinyl estradiol/drospire-
none, and ethinyl estradiol/drospirenone/levomefo-
late. The mechanism of action of COCs in the
treatment of acne is based on their antiandrogenic
properties.
These
pills
decrease
androgen
production at the level of the ovary and also increase
sex
hormoneebinding
globulin,
binding
free
circulating testosterone and rendering it unavailable
to bind and activate the androgen receptor. In
addition, COCs reduce 5-alfa-reductase activity and
block the androgen receptor.219,221-223
Numerous randomized controlled clinical trials
have assessed the efficacy of COCs in the manage-
ment of acne.98-101,221,224-226 It is evident from these
trials that COCs reduce acnedboth inflammatory
and comedonal lesion counts. It is more difficult to
determine which, if any, COC is consistently superior
in
the
treatment
of
acne.
A
2012
Cochrane
metaanalysis assessed the effect of birth control
pills on acne in women and included 31 trials with
a total of 12,579 women. Nine trials compared a COC
to placebo, and all of these COCs worked well to
reduce acne. The progestins included in these 9 trials
were levonorgestrel, norethindrone acetate, norges-
timate, drospirenone, dienogest, and chlormadinone
acetate. Seventeen trials compared 2 COCs, but no
consistent
differences
in
acne
reduction
were
appreciated based on formulation or dosage of the
COC. Only 1 small study compared a COC to an oral
antibiotic; no significant difference in self-assessed
acne improvement was identified.221
A recent publication evaluated the effectiveness
of drospirenone 3 mg/ethinyl estradiol 20 �g in the
treatment of moderate truncal AV. The COC showed
significant
reductions
in
inflammatory,
non-
inflammatory, and total acne lesions compared to
placebo.227
The risks of COCs must be weighed against the
risks of the condition that they are treating or
preventing. When COCs are used for contraception,
their risks must be compared to the risks of
pregnancy. If COCs are used exclusively for acne,
their risks must be compared to the risks of acne. It is
important to remember that FDA approval of all
COCs for acne specifies that they are approved for
the treatment of acne in women who also desire
contraception.
COC use is associated with cardiovascular risks.
Venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) have been
the center of an ongoing debate regarding COCs.
Traditionally, higher doses of ethinyl estradiol have
been linked to increased risks of VTE. However,
in
recent
years,
some
progestins
have
been
implicated
as
risk
factors
for
VTE.
A
recent
Cochrane metaanalysis evaluated 25 publications
reporting on 26 studies focused on oral contra-
ceptives
and
venous
thrombosis. The
analysis
concluded that all COC use increases the risk of
VTE compared to nonusers. The relative risk of
venous thrombosis for COCs with 30 to 35 �g of
ethinyl estradiol and gestodene, desogestrel, cyprot-
erone acetate, or drospirenone was similar and about
50% to 80% higher than for COCs with levonorges-
trel.228 To put this increased risk into perspective, it is
important to note that the baseline risk of VTE in
nonpregnant, nonusers of COCs is 1 to 5 per 10,000
woman-years. Users of COCs have a VTE risk of 3 to
9 per 10,000 woman-years. Users of drospirenone-
containing COCs have a VTE risk of about 10 per
10,000 woman-years. Pregnant women have a VTE
risk between 5 and 20 per 10,000 woman-years, and
women within 12 weeks postpartum have a VTE risk
of between 40 and 65 per 10,000 woman-years.229,230
Myocardial infarction (MI) risks are also increased
in COC users. This risk is strongly associated with
cigarette smoking and other risk factors, such as
diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The WHO
reports that COCs are not associated with an
increased risk of MI in healthy, normotensive,
nondiabetic, nonsmokers at any age.231 There is
also
an
increased
risk
of
both
ischemic
and
hemorrhagic stroke in COC users. Cigarette smoking
and hypertension contribute to this increased risk, as
do higher doses of ethinyl estradiol and age
[35 years. While these are serious potential adverse
events, these cardiovascular events are uncommon
in women of reproductive age. An increased relative
risk still translates to an overall low absolute
risk.219,222,232
COC use may be associated with an increased
risk of breast cancer in some women. A large
metaanalysis including data from 53,297 women
with breast cancer and 100,239 controls showed an
increased risk of breast cancer in current users of
COCs. The relative risk of breast cancer in current
COC users was 1.24 (95% confidence interval [CI],
1.15-1.33). This increased risk disappeared 10 years
after COC discontinuation. Age at first use of a COC
was the only factor that was associated with an
overall increased risk. Risk did not appear to
J AM ACAD DERMATOL
MAY 2016
956
Zaenglein et al
 correlate with the duration of use of the COC or
family history of breast cancer.233 A more recent
systematic review of cancer risks associated with oral
contraceptive use also showed an increased relative
risk (1.08; 95% CI, 1.00-1.17) of breast cancer in COC
users, and higher risk was associated with more
recent use of a COC.234 Notably, this increased risk of
breast cancer is greatest in women\34 years of age,
when the overall incidence of breast cancer is at its
lowest.233
The risk of cervical cancer may be increased in
women
who
use
COCs.
An
analysis
of
24
observational studies found that the risk of cervical
cancer increases with an increased duration of COC
use. The risk declines after the COC is discontinued
and the increase in risk disappears after 10 years of
nonuse.235 Another systematic review found no
significant increase in the risk of cervical cancer
among ever-users of COCs and never-users from 9
pooled studies. This study did show an increased risk
of cervical cancer in women with [5 years of COC
use compared with never-users, but the difference
was not statistically significant.234
There is additional concern regarding COC use in
younger adolescent populations given the adverse
effects of low estrogen on bone mass. Peak bone
mass development occurs during adolescence and
young adulthood. The addition of low-dose estrogen
COCs early in the teen years may undermine the
accrual of bone mass.236 Osteopenia or decreased
bone mineral density with COC use has not been
shown.237,238 However, definitive conclusions are
yet to be made. In general, the use of COC for acne
should be avoided within 2 years of first starting
menses or in patients who are \14 years of
age unless it is clinically warranted. The FDA
has approved COC use for females 14 years
(eg, drospirenone and drosperinone/levomefolate)
or 15 years (eg, norgestimate and norethindrone/
ferrous fumarate) and older (and desiring use of a
COC as mentioned above).
There are many noncontraceptive benefits of
COCs in addition to the improvement of acne.
These include regulation of the menstrual cycle,
lessening of menorrhagia and associated anemia,
and a reduction in the formation of benign ovarian
tumors. Decreased risks of colorectal, ovarian, and
endometrial cancers have been shown in COC
users.222,239
Oral contraceptives may improve acne for many
women. They may be used alone or in combination
with other acne treatments. While some women
present with signs or symptoms suggestive of a
hormonally
induced
worsening
of
acne
(ie,
premenstrual flares or hirsutism), the use of COCs
is not limited to these individuals. Any woman
with signs or symptoms of hyperandrogenism
should
be
evaluated
appropriately
for
an
underlying cause. However, COCs may be beneficial
to women with clinical and laboratory findings of
hyperandrogenism and in women without these
findings.
COCs may be included as part of a comprehensive
acne
treatment
regimen.
Women
who
desire
contraception or who suffer from menorrhagia may
choose to begin a COC early in their acne treatment.
In other women, COCs may be added to a treatment
regimen when results with other agents have been
limited.
COCs
may
be
used
in
combination
with other oral acne medications, including the
tetracycline class of antibiotics and spironolactone.
There is much misunderstanding regarding the
concomitant use of oral antibiotics and COCs
and putative contraceptive failure. Rifampin and
griseofulvin are the only antiinfectives that interact
with COCs, lessening their effectiveness.240 The
tetracycline class of antibiotics has not been shown
to reduce the effectiveness of COCs when taken
concomitantly.222,232,241,242
Because the progestin drospirenone is an analog
of spironolactone, there has been some concern
that using a drospirenone-containing COC and
spironolactone together might increase the risk of
hyperkalemia. In 1 study, 27 women with acne were
treated with a COC containing drospirenone 3 mg
and ethinyl estradiol 30 �g and spironolactone
100 mg each day. There were no significant
elevations of serum potassium and there were no
additional
side
effects
significant
enough
to
discontinue treatment.243
Acne
reduction
with
COC
use
takes
time.
Randomized controlled trials consistently show
a
statistically
significant
improvement
in
acne
with COCs compared to placebo by the end of cycle
3.98-101,224,225 Those treated with COCs for acne
should be educated that acne reduction may not be
appreciated for the first few months of treatment.
Therefore,
combining
COCs
with
other
acne
medications early in treatment may be appropriate.
A Papanicolaou smear and a bimanual pelvic
examination are no longer deemed mandatory
before initiating the use of a COC. While these
screening
examinations
may
offer
valuable
information, they do not identify women who
should not take a COC and should not be required
before initiating treatment with a COC. Obtaining a
thorough medical history and a blood pressure
measurement are important before prescribing a
COC.244 Proper patient selection is imperative to
minimize risks associated with COC use. The WHO
J AM ACAD DERMATOL
VOLUME 74, NUMBER 5

 has published contraindications for the use of
COCs.245
Spironolactone
is
an
aldosterone
receptor
antagonist that exhibits potent antiandrogen activity
by decreasing testosterone production
and by
competitively inhibiting binding of testosterone
and dihydrotestosterone to androgen receptors in
the skin.246-249 It may also inhibit 5-alfa-reductase
and
increase
steroid
hormoneebinding
glob-
ulin.250,251 Its use as an antiandrogen is not approved
by the FDA for the treatment of acne. Two small,
placebo-controlled
prospective
studies
showed
statistically significant improvement in acne severity
and sebum production at doses ranging from 50 to
200 mg daily.252,253 A retrospective chart review of 85
patients treated with spironolactone 50 to 100 mg
daily, either as monotherapy or as adjunctive
therapy, revealed that 66% of women were clear or
markedly improved with favorable tolerability at
these lower doses.102 More recently, a Japanese
study investigated the efficacy of spironolactone in
Asian patients. One hundred thirty-nine Japanese
patients (116 women and 23 men) were treated with
spironolactone 200 mg daily for 8 weeks, followed
by a taper of 50 mg every 4 weeks over a total of
20 weeks. All 64 women who completed the study
had clinical improvement ranging from good to
excellent. The study was discontinued prematurely
in the male patients because of the development of
gynecomastia.103 Given the small number and size of
available studies, a recent Cochrane database review
concluded that there are insufficient data to support
the efficacy of spironolactone in the treatment of
acne.254 Despite the lack of published data, relying
on available evidence, experience, and expert
opinion, the work group supports the use of
spironolactone in the management of acne in select
women.
Spironolactone is well tolerated overall, and its
side effects are dose-related. Common side effects
include
diuresis
(29%),
menstrual
irregularities
(22%), breast tenderness (17%), breast enlargement,
fatigue, headache, and dizziness.255 Spironolactone
is also pregnancy category C; animal studies have
shown feminization of a male fetus early in gestation.
Therefore, concomitant use of a COC is often
recommended to both regulate menses and prevent
pregnancy in many patients. Hyperkalemia is a
potentially serious side effect that, fortunately, is
rare in young healthy individuals with normal
hepatic, adrenal, and renal function. Noneclinically
relevant elevations may occur in about 13.7% of
patients.228 A recent retrospective database review
identifying 967 women between 18 and 45 years of
age taking spironolactone 50 to 200 mg daily for acne
found that only 0.75% of the 1723 associated
potassium measurements exceeded 5.0 mmol/L. Six
of the 13 abnormal tests were normal upon repeat
testing. Patients with renal or cardiovascular disease
and those taking angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers were
excluded. Based on these findings, the authors
concluded that testing for potassium in young
healthy women taking spironolactone for acne is
unnecessary.256 Serum potassium testing is therefore
not required, but should be considered in older
patients and in patients who are also taking
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angio-
tensin receptor blockers, nonsteroidal antiinflamma-
tory drugs, and digoxin. Measurements should be
performed at baseline, during therapy, and after
dose increases in these patients. Patients should also
be educated about avoiding foods that are high in
dietary potassium, such as low-sodium processed
foods and coconut water.257 Spironolactone may
also be used safely with drospirenone-containing
COCs. No elevations in serum potassium were
identified in a series of 27 patients treated with
spironolactone 100 mg daily in combination with
ethinyl estradiol 30 �g/drospirenone 3 mg.243
Animal studies using up to 150 times human doses
of spironolactone or its metabolite found the
development of thyroid, hepatic, testicular, and
breast adenomas, as well as thyroid carcinoma and
myelocytic leukemia. These findings contributed to a
black box warning stating that the off-label and
unnecessary
use
of
spironolactone
should
be
avoided. To date, there has been only 1 human
report suggesting carcinogenicity in which the
authors
identified
5
hospitalized
patients
with
breast cancer who were taking spironolactone
among other medications258; however, subsequent
longitudinal and retrospective studies found no
association.255,259,260 In addition, a recent large
retrospective matched cohort study of 1.29 million
women [55 years of age found no association
between spironolactone use and breast cancer with
8.4 million patient-years of use, further disproving
any causal relationship.261 These findings were
supported by another large retrospective cohort
study of 2.3 million women representing 28.8 million
person-years that showed no association between
spironolactone use and the development of breast,
uterine, cervical, or ovarian cancers.262
Flutamide is a nonsteroidal selective androgen
receptor blocker used in the treatment of prostate
cancer. It is not approved by the FDA for use in acne.
Doses ranging from 250 mg twice daily to as little as
62.5 mg daily have shown efficacy in the treatment of
acne in small prospective trials.104,263-267 Flutamide
J AM ACAD DERMATOL
MAY 2016
958
Zaenglein et al
 250 mg twice daily combined with a triphasic COC
reduced acne by 80% compared with spironolactone
50 mg twice daily/COC, which reduced acne by only
50% after 3 months of therapy.245
Common side effects associated with flutamide
include gastrointestinal distress, breast tenderness,
hot
flashes,
headache,
xerosis,
and
decreased
libido.228,267 High rates of side effects among users
may decrease compliance with use.105 In 1 prospec-
tive randomized trial of 131 women, side effects at a
dose of 125 mg daily were comparable to placebo.267
Importantly, flutamide use has been associated with
idiosyncratic fatal hepatotoxicity, which appears to
be dose- and age-related.268,269 Therefore, liver
function tests need careful monitoring, and the risk
of this serious adverse effect must be considered. Use
of flutamide in the treatment of acne is discouraged
except where benefit warrants the risk.
Low-dose prednisone in doses ranging from 5 to
15 mg daily, administered alone or with high-
estrogen containing COCs, has shown efficacy in
the
treatment
of
acne
and
seborrhea.106,270,271
However, long-term adverse effects of corticoste-
roids prohibit use as a primary therapy for acne.
Prednisone in doses of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day is
indicated
for
treatment
of
the
systemic
and
cutaneous manifestations of acne fulminans and for
treatment and prevention of isotretinoin-induced
acne fulminanselike eruptions. A slow taper over
several months is recommended while transitioning
to isotretinoin or oral antibiotics in order to minimize
relapses.272,273
Isotretinoin
Oral isotretinoin, an isomer of retinoic acid, has
been used in the United States for the treatment of
acne for [30 years and is approved by the FDA for
the treatment of severe recalcitrant AV. Its use has
proven successful for most patients with severe acne,
resulting in decreased sebum production, acne
lesions, and acne scarring, along with a decrease in
symptoms of anxiety and depression.107-117,274-277 It
has also been effectively used in the treatment of
moderate acne that is either treatment-resistant or
that relapses quickly after the discontinuation of oral
antibiotic therapy.32,134-138 It is the consensus of the
current
working
group
that
the
presence
of
moderate acne that is either treatment-resistant, or
that
produces
physical
scarring
or
significant
psychosocial distress, is an indication for treatment
with
oral
isotretinoin.
Recommendations
for
isotretinoin are shown in Table IX, and the strength
of recommendations for treatment of acne with
isotretinoin
therapy
is
shown
in
Table
III.
Prescribing
information
for
the
treatment
of
acne with isotretinoin is listed in Supplementary
Table XXIX.
When
used
for
severe
AV,
isotretinoin
is
commonly initiated at a starting dose 0.5 mg/kg/day
for the first month, then increased to 1.0 mg/kg/day
thereafter as tolerated by the patient.118 In extremely
severe cases, even lower starting doses, with or
without the concomitant use of oral steroids, may
be needed. In earlier studies of optimal dosing of
isotretinoin in patients with severe AV, doses ranging
from 0.1 mg/kg/day to 1.0 mg/kg/day were most
commonly used. Some efficacy was generally seen at
all doses, along with a dose-dependent decrease in
sebum
production.109
While
there
was
not
a
significant difference in the improvement of acne
by the end of the treatment course between doses of
0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day in most of the studies, there
was a significant difference in relapse rates and
the need for retreatment; patients treated with
approximately 1.0 mg/kg/day had a significantly
lower relapse rate and a lower rate of retreatment
with isotretinoin than those treated with 0.5 mg/kg/
day.110,112,116 Similarly, a lower relapse rate was
seen for those treated with a cumulative dose of
[120 mg/kg
compared to those
treated with
Table IX. Recommendations for isotretinoin
Oral isotretinoin is recommended for the treatment of severe nodular acne
Oral isotretinoin is appropriate for the treatment of moderate acne that is treatment-resistant or for the management of
acne that is producing physical scarring or psychosocial distress
Low-dose isotretinoin can be used to effectively treat acne and reduce the frequency and severity of medication-related side
effects. Intermittent dosing of isotretinoin is not recommended
Routine monitoring of liver function tests, serum cholesterol, and triglycerides at baseline and again until response to
treatment is established is recommended. Routine monitoring of complete blood count is not recommended
All patients treated with isotretinoin must adhere to the iPLEDGE risk management program
Females of child-bearing potential taking isotretinoin should be counseled regarding various contraceptive methods
including user-independent forms
Prescribing physicians also should monitor their patients for any indication of inflammatory bowel disease and depressive
symptoms and educate their patients about the potential risks with isotretinoin

 \120 mg/kg.110,119 It has been suggested that this
dose-dependent therapeutic benefit plateaus beyond
150 mg/kg.119 Therefore, in patients with severe AV,
the work group supports initiation of isotretinoin at
0.5 mg/kg/day when appropriate, subsequently
increasing to a full dose of 1 mg/kg/day after the first
month as tolerated, with a goal cumulative dose
between 120 and 150 mg/kg. One recent study of 116
patients found that a cumulative dose of 220 mg/kg or
more may result in lower relapse rates, but confir-
mation will require study in larger populations.278
Isotretinoin
treatment
has
been
studied
in
patients with treatment-resistant or quick-relapsing,
moderate AV. In this patient population, multiple
studies
have
found
that
low-dose
isotretinoin
(0.25-0.4 mg/kg/day) is effective in the treatment of
acne, and that this efficacy is comparable to the use
of more conventional dosing.32,107,134,135,279 This
may also be true for a low cumulative dose
regimen.136 In addition, low-dose regimens are
associated with a decreased rate of medication-
related adverse effects, thereby leading to improved
tolerability
and
increased
patient
satisfac-
tion.107,134,135,279,280 Unlike in patients with severe
acne, relapse rates in patients with moderate acne
treated with low-dose isotretinoin are equal to
relapse rates in those treated with conventional
dosing.32,279 Intermittent dosing, however, is not as
effective and is associated with higher relapse rates;
therefore, it is not recommended.32,134,135,276
Isotretinoin is highly lipophilic and is best
absorbed when taken with food.115,120,121 Patients
should be instructed to take isotretinoin with meals.
One formulation, isotretinoin with lidose, uses lipid
agents to encase the medication, bypassing the need
for food, and can be taken on an empty stomach.121
Common adverse effects associated with the
intake of isotretinoin have been well documented
and reviewed in previous guidelines.1 The most
prevalent side effects involve the mucocutaneous,
musculoskeletal, and ophthalmic systems, generally
mimicking symptoms of hypervitaminosis A. With
standard courses, these side effects are temporary
and resolve without sequelae after discontinuation
of the drug. Other real and speculative adverse
effects of interest include inflammatory bowel
disease,
depression/anxiety/mood
changes,
cardiovascular risk factors, bone mineralization,
concerns
regarding
scarring,
and
S
aureus
colonization.
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) consists of
ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD).
Several retrospective analyses have been performed
to
determine
whether
there
is
an
association
between isotretinoin intake and IBD.122-126,281,282
While 2 studies123,282 have shown a potential
relationship, more recent analyses122,125,283 suggest
no
association
between
IBD
and
isotretinoin
ingestion. The most convincing article suggesting
an association between isotretinoin and UC124 was
directly refuted by a later analysis of the same
database.125 Therefore, the work group agrees with
the position statement of the American Academy of
Dermatology
that
the
‘‘current
evidence
is
insufficient to prove either an association or causal
relationship between isotretinoin use and IBD.’’284
Changes in mood, including depression, suicidal
ideation, and suicide have been reported sporadi-
cally in patients who are taking isotretinoin.127,285 To
date, no studies to suggest an evidence-based link
between isotretinoin and depression, anxiety, mood
changes, or suicidal ideation/suicide exist. Multiple
studies have shown no evidence of depression
from isotretinoin on a population basis.128-133,137,285
On
the
contrary,
most
studies
have
shown
isotretinoin
to
improve
or
have
no
negative
effects on mood, memory, attention, or executive
functions.113,128-133,137,285-288 However, given the
prevalence of depression, anxiety, and suicidal
ideation/suicide in the general population, and
especially the adolescent population who may be
candidates for isotretinoin therapy, the prescribing
physician should continue to monitor for these
symptoms and make therapeutic decisions within
the context of each individual patient.
Physicians prescribing isotretinoin need to be
aware of guidelines for evidence-based monitoring
of side effects. Interest in bone demineralization and
premature
epiphyseal
closure
observed
with
long-term oral retinoid intake led to early concerns
about these issues for patients taking isotretinoin for
acne. While premature epiphyseal closure has been
reported in 2 isolated patients who were taking
short-term isotretinoin for acne,289,290 these effects
have not been reported in any other studies of
patients taking short-term isotretinoin therapy for
AV.119,139 It remains the opinion of this work group
that routine screening for these issues is not required
in patients who are taking short-term isotretinoin
therapy. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides, as well
as transaminases, have been known to rise in some
patients taking oral isotretinoin.140-142 While there is
no proof of long-term cardiovascular risk from
short-term elevation of triglycerides and cholesterol
during short-term isotretinoin therapy,140 the routine
monitoring of serum lipid profiles and liver function
studies
should continue.139,142,291,292 This work
group could find no evidence-based reason that
routine monitoring of complete blood cell counts is
warranted.

 Several

delayed
wound healing or keloid formation in patients who
were taking or had recently taken isotretinoin,
leading to the current recommendation to delay
procedures
such
as
dermabrasion
or
laser
resurfacing until 6 to 12 months after discontinuing
isotretinoin.293,294 Recent prospective small inter-
ventional studies did not find atypical scarring with
chemical peels or manual dermabrasion in any
patient currently or recently on isotretinoin.291,294
There are also retrospective studies and case reports
demonstrating safety with laser hair removal, pulsed
dye laser, and CO2 laser.295-299 While elective
procedures should be delayed for 6 to 12 months
when possible, careful consideration may be given
on a case by case basis.
Higher rates of colonization with S aureus have
been seen in patients taking systemic isotretinoin,
leading to increased rates of minor skin infections,
such as folliculitis and furunculosis.300,301 On rare
occasions, the combination of cheilitis and S aureus
colonization can cause lip or perioral abscesses, a
serious complication requiring prompt attention.300
The teratogenic effects of isotretinoin and the risk
for retinoic acid embryopathy are well known. After
introduction of isotretinoin in the United States in
1982, there were hundreds of reports of isotretinoin-
exposed pregnancies within just several years,
resulting in a high rate of congenital malforma-
tions.302 Because of this, the first risk management
program was implemented. iPLEDGE is now the
third risk management program that has been put in
place in an effort to prevent isotretinoin exposure
during pregnancy. As mandated by the FDA, all
patients
receiving
isotretinoindboth
men
and
womendare required to enroll in and adhere to
the iPLEDGE risk management program. Despite
this, fetal exposure has not significantly decreased
since
the
implementation
of
iPLEDGE,
and
approximately 150 isotretinoin-exposed pregnan-
cies still occur in the United States each year143,144
because
of
noncompliance
with
the
iPLEDGE
contraceptive requirements to abstain from sex or
to use 2 contraceptive methods. Nearly one-third of
all women of childbearing potential in a recent US
study
admitted
noncompliance
with
iPLEDGE
pregnancy prevention requirements; of those that
were sexually active, 29% did not comply with the
use of condoms that they had agreed to use as 1 of
their methods, and 39% missed $1 contraceptive
pills in the previous month.144 Therefore, every
woman of child-bearing potential taking isotretinoin
should be carefully counseled regarding various
contraceptive methods that are available and the
specific requirements of the iPLEDGE system at
each clinic visit. Patient-independent forms of
birth
control,
including
long-acting
reversible
contraceptives, should be considered whenever
appropriate.
MISCELLANEOUS THERAPIES/PHYSICAL
MODALITIES
There is limited evidence published in the
peer-reviewed medical literature that addresses the
efficacy of comedo removal for the treatment of
acne despite its long-standing clinical use. It is,
however, the opinion of the work group that
comedo removal is often helpful in the management
of comedones that are resistant to other therapies.
Recommendations for miscellaneous therapies and
physical modalities are listed in Table X, and the
strength
of
recommendations
for
treatment
of
acne using miscellaneous therapies and physical
modalities
is
shown
in
Table
III.
Prescribing
information
for
miscellaneous
therapies
and
physical modalities is located in Supplementary
Tables XXX-XXXIII.
Studies exist suggesting that chemical peels
may improve acne. However, large, multicenter,
double-blinded control trials comparing peels to
placebo and comparing different peels are lacking.
Glycolic acid and salicylic acid chemical peels
may be helpful for noninflammatory (comedonal)
lesions.145-147,303,304 However, multiple treatments
are needed and the results are not long-lasting. In
the opinion of the work group, chemical peels may
result in mild improvement in comedonal acne.
Some laser and light devices may be beneficial for
acne, but additional studies are needed. Studies exist
evaluating the use of many lasers, including pulsed
dye laser, potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser,
fractionated and nonfractionated infrared lasers, and
the fractionated CO2 laser. Light devices aside from
lasers have also been investigated, including radio-
frequency, intense pulsed light, photopneumatic
therapy, and photodynamic therapy (PDT).
Table X. Recommendations for miscellaneous therapies and physical modalities
There is limited evidence to recommend the use and benefit of physical modalities for the routine treatment of acne,
including pulsed dye laser, glycolic acid peels, and salicylic acid peels
Intralesional corticosteroid injections are effective in the treatment of individual acne nodules
J AM ACAD DERMATOL
VOLUME 74, NUMBER 5
Zaenglein et al
961
 Of all laser and light devices, the most evidence
exists for PDT in treating acne.305-308 With PDT, a
photosensitizer, such as aminolevulinic acid, is first
applied to the affected skin for a period of time
(varying
from
15
minutes
to
3
hours).
The
photosensitizer
is
then
absorbed
into
the
pilosebaceous units and is preferentially taken up
by sebocytes. A laser or light device is then used to
activate
the
photosensitizer,
generating
singlet
oxygen species, and thereby damaging the seba-
ceous glands and reducing P acnes. This treatment
shows great promise, but additional studies are
needed to determine the optimal photosensitizer,
incubation time, and light source.
Intralesional injection of triamcinolone acetonide
is a commonly used technique for the management
of larger, nodular lesions in patients with acne.148,149
Rapid improvement and decreased pain are noted.
Local atrophy, systemic absorption of steroids, and
possible
adrenal
suppression
may
occur.309
Decreasing the concentration and the volume of
steroid used will minimize these complications.
COMPLEMENTARY/ALTERNATIVE
THERAPIES
Two clinical trials have shown that topical tea tree
oil is effective for the treatment of acne.150,151 In 1
study, it was comparable to BP but better tolerated.
Other herbal agents, such as topical and oral
ayurvedic compounds, oral barberry extract, and
gluconolactone solution have been reported to have
value in the treatment of acne.152-155
The
psychological
effects
of
acne
may
be
profound, and it is the opinion of the expert work
group that effective acne treatment can improve
the emotional outlook of patients. There is weak
evidence of the possible benefit of biofeedback-
assisted relaxation and cognitive imagery.156,310
The recommendation for using complementary
and alternative therapies is listed in Table XI, and the
strength of recommendation for treatment of acne
using complementary and alternative therapies is
shown in Table III.
ROLE OF DIET IN ACNE
Emerging evidence suggests that high glycemic
index diets may be associated with acne. In 2007, a
randomized controlled trial with 23 Australian males
15 to 25 years of age examined the impact of a low
glycemic diet on acne. Those randomized to follow
the low glycemic load (LGL) diet had significant
improvement in acne severity, a significant reduction
in weight and body mass index (BMI), a significant
decrease in free androgen index, and improved
insulin sensitivity at the end of 12 weeks.157 The
study was limited by its small sample size and the fact
that both groups lost weight. In 2012, a 10-week
randomized controlled trial was conducted in 32
Korean subjects (24 men and 8 women) 20 to 27 years
of age. Those randomized to the LGL diet had a
statistically significant improvement in acne severity
and no change in weight and BMI. Histologic
analyses
were
conducted,
and
the
authors
found that the size of the sebaceous glands were
significantly reduced in the LGL group, whereas
hematoxylineeosin stains revealed a decrease in
inflammatory cells and additional stains showed a
decrease in inflammatory cytokines.158 Although
these 2 studies are the most rigorous to date
analyzing the effect of glycemic index diets on
acne, a small number of studies further support this
association.159-161,311
While no randomized controlled trials have been
conducted to examine the role of dairy consumption
and acne, several observational studies suggest that
certain dairy products, especially skim milk, may
aggravate acne. In 2005, a retrospective study
analyzed data from 47,355 adult women who were
asked to recall their high school diet. They were also
asked to recall if they had ‘‘physician-diagnosed
acne.’’ In this study, acne was positively associated
with the reported quantity of milk ingestion. The
strongest association was noted with skim milk.
Specifically, women who consumed $2 glasses of
skim milk a day had a 44% increased risk of reporting
acne.312 This study was heavily criticized for its
retrospective design, so the same research group
conducted 2 follow-up, prospective studies. The first

 was conducted on a cohort of girls, and found that
acne was associated with total milk intake, whole
milk, low-fat milk, and skim milk.162 The second
study focused on boys only, and found that acne was
associated with the intake of skim milk only.163 More
recently, a case control study involving 88 Malaysian
subjects 18 to 30 years of age found that the
frequency of milk and ice cream consumption was
significantly higher in patients with acne compared
to controls.161 Dermatologist-assessed subjects who
consumed milk or ice cream $1 time per week had a
4-fold increased risk of having acne. No association
was found with cheese or yogurt. Also in 2012,
another case control study involving 563 Italian
subjects 10 to 24 years of age found that the risk of
acne was also increased with milk consumption.164
The association was more marked with skim milk,
and again no association was seen with cheese or
yogurt.
Although some small preliminary studies have
examined the role of antioxidants (including oral
zinc313), probiotics,314 and fish oil315 on acne, the
existing evidence is not strong enough to support
any
recommendations
regarding
these
dietary
factors at this time. Recommendations for the role
of diet in acne are listed in Table XII, and the strength
of recommendations for the role of diet in acne is
shown in Table III.
