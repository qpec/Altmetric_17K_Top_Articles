Abstract
Background: Community-based services such as telephone support lines can provide valuable informational, emotional, and
practical support for cancer patients via telephone- or Web-based (live chat or email) platforms. However, very little rigorous
research has examined the efficacy of such services in improving patient outcomes.
Objective: This study will determine whether: proactive telephone or Web-delivered support produces outcomes superior to
printed information; and Web-delivered support produces outcomes comparable to telephone support.
Methods: A consecutive sample of 501 lung cancer outpatients will be recruited from 50 Australian health services to participate
in a patient-randomized controlled trial (RCT). Eligible individuals must: be 18 years or older; have received a lung cancer
diagnosis (including mesothelioma) within the previous 4 months; have an approximate life expectancy of at least 6 months; and
have Internet access. Participants will be randomly allocated to receive: (1) an information booklet, (2) proactive telephone
support, or (3) proactive Web support, chat, and/or email. The primary patient outcomes will be measured by the General Health
Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and Health Education and Impact Questionnaire (heiQ) at 3 and 6 months post recruitment. The
acceptability of proactive recruitment strategies will also be assessed.

 Results: It is hypothesized that participants receiving telephone or Web support will report reduced distress (GHQ-12 scores
that are 0.3 standard deviations (SD) lower) and greater self-efficacy (heiQ scores that are 0.3 SDs higher) than participants
receiving booklets. Individuals receiving Web support will report heiQ scores within 0.29 SDs of individuals receiving telephone
support.
Conclusions: If proven effective, electronic approaches such as live-chat and email have the potential to increase the accessibility
and continuity of supportive care delivered by community-based services. This evidence may also inform the redesigning of
helpline-style services to be effective and responsive to patient needs.

Introduction
Background
Cancer is one of the leading causes of disease-related burden
in Australia. Lung cancer is the fourth most incident cancer and
approximately 10,300 cases were diagnosed in 2014 [1,2]. Lung
cancer mortality rates are relatively higher than other cancer
types, with only 6% of those diagnosed with small cell lung
cancer surviving 5 years post diagnosis [3]. Lung cancer patients
and survivors also report a wide array of physical and
psychological issues and, when compared with 6 other common
cancer types, report significantly higher levels of clinically
significant anxiety and depression [4-6]. Despite the clear
evidence-based imperative for providing supportive care to lung
cancer patients to maximize their quality of life, this group is
under researched in terms of supportive care [7].
Generally, cancer patients report dissatisfaction with the amount
and type of information provided regarding management of
their health, the failure of health care providers to attend to or
offer referral for psychosocial needs, and poor coordination of
services [8]. These experiences can exacerbate patients’
suffering. With health care resources stretched to capacity, there
is an urgent need to assess the potential benefits of alternative
modes of service delivery. These modes may include services
provided by community-based organizations rather than
hospitals or physicians; and telephone-based or Web platforms
rather than the relatively costly and less accessible face-to-face
options. However, despite the evidence of their need for support,
lung cancer patients are underrepresented in the overall profile
of community cancer support service users [9]. Proactive
strategies for engaging this vulnerable group with alternative
community-based services may provide a valuable opportunity
to enhance lung cancer care, particularly in providing
information and support in managing the debilitating
consequences of diagnoses and treatments.
There is substantial evidence that intensive psychological
strategies have been associated with improved psychological
health and quality of life in cancer patients [10]. A common
example of an intensive strategy is cognitive behavior therapy
(CBT) in which adaptive coping elements such as emotional
support, positive reframing, planning, acceptance, and support
seeking are incorporated into care. A Cochrane review of
supportive care interventions including psychotherapeutic
interventions and nurse-led counseling improved the emotional,
psychological, and physical states (ie, dyspnea) of lung cancer
patients [11]. In contrast, relatively little rigorous research has
examined the effects of less-intensive forms of supportive care
provision for cancer patients [12]. These less-intensive forms
of counseling may be delivered by community-based telephone
helplines, whereby, unlike hospital-based services, individuals
do not receive face-to-face counseling from health professionals
familiar with their current care; may have a focus on practical
or informational support; and may be a singular encounter.
The Cancer Information and Support (CIS) line is a
cancer-specific telephone-based service operated by each
state-based Cancer Council in Australia via a national telephone
number; the same model operates within the United Kingdom
and United States [9,13,14]. The service is staffed by
experienced health professionals and provides free, confidential
support related to informational, emotional, and practical
concerns based on a brief, integrative model of care. A recent
review found that telephone-based follow-up care conducted
by an experienced nurse was acceptable to patients,
cost-effective, and at least equivalent to traditional face-to-face
follow-up care in meeting patients’ needs [15]. Hence, telephone
delivery means that individualized services can be provided to
a broad cross-section of cancer patients in a timely fashion while
minimizing cost, logistic, and system barriers [16].
Although telephone-delivered supportive care services, including
the CIS, have undergone evaluation of patient use, satisfaction,
and acceptability, very little rigorous research has been directed
toward understanding the real-world effects of low-intensity
models, such as the provision of information, emotional support,
and practical support in improving cancer patients’ outcomes
[14,17-19]. A systematic review identified only 4 randomized
controlled trials (RCT) of similar services with conflicting
results reported [20]. One RCT provided evidence of efficacy
in that phone-based education and social support delivered by
research assistants resulted in reduced mood disturbance
compared with mailed education [21]. The remaining 3 trials
did not find a significant effect on psychosocial outcomes
including distress, anxiety, or depression [22-24]. None of these
trials were conducted with lung cancer patients.
While telephone-based support is the traditional mode of
delivery of these services, some services are seeking to or have
recently included parallel forms of Web support [9,25]. These
technology-based approaches are perceived to be accessible,
safe, flexible, and anonymous by patients [26-28]. Automated

 electronic platforms for the delivery of intensive psychological
therapies (eg, CBT) have also been found to be effective in
reducing anxiety and depression [29]. However, a review by
Gustafson et al [30] identified mixed effects when information
and support for breast cancer patients was delivered via
automated, electronic formats. For community-based services,
establishing the efficacy of Web support can provide much
needed guidance for deciding if this mode of support should be
included as part of the suite of services provided.
In the context of the CIS service, the most appropriate first step
for testing Web approaches may be via a proactive and
personalized, rather than automated, version of the service
through email and live chat. Email counseling involves the
patient and counselor exchanging questions and responses at
the frequency of their choosing over the Internet. Live chat
involves typed interactive conversations occurring in real-time
over the Internet. Evidence for online peer-support forums and
email is promising with a RCT of a multicomponent Web
intervention reporting decreased global severity scores in a
sample of 325 breast and prostate cancer patients [31]. However,
there is no literature regarding Internet-delivered versions of
low-intensity community-based support akin to that offered by
the CIS service. For example, a Cochrane review examining
the effects of email and Web-messaging between patients and
health professionals was unable to establish the benefits of such
Web-based platforms due to the lack of high-quality studies
identified [32]; relevant to this study, none of the 9 reviewed
articles included cancer samples.
This multisite, blinded, patient-RCT will be the first to conduct
a robust study of the relative merits of telephone- versus
Web-based methods for providing low-intensity information
and support to people affected by cancer. Newly diagnosed lung
cancer patients will be recruited by health professionals and
randomly-allocated on a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 arms: (1) a printed
information booklet, (2) proactive telephone-delivered support,
or (3) proactive Web-delivered support. The Consolidated
Standards of Reporting Trials of Electronic and Mobile HEalth
Applications and onLine TeleHealth is used to describe this
study [33].
Aims
The aims of this study are to identify among a group of newly
diagnosed lung cancer patients, if: (1) information and support
provided either electronically (email and live chat) or by
telephone following active recruitment can produce psychosocial
outcomes, which are superior to those achieved by minimal
ethical care (a printed ‘Understanding Lung Cancer’ information
booklet), and (2) information and support provided electronically
can produce psychosocial outcomes, which are comparable to
those achieved by a telephone approach.
Intervention effectiveness will be measured by changes in 2
primary outcomes: General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12)
and Health Education Impact Questionnaire (heiQ) scores from
baseline to 3 and 6 months post recruitment. Higher GHQ-12
scores represent greater distress; once standardized, higher heiQ
scores indicate better functioning as a result of improved
self-efficacy and health literacy.
Hypotheses
It is hypothesized that at 6 months follow-up: (1) those in the
2 experimental conditions (proactive telephone-delivered or
Web-delivered support) will have GHQ-12 scores that are 0.3
of a standard deviation (SD) lower than those for the control
condition and heiQ scores that are 0.3 of a SD higher than those
for the control condition, and (2) those in the proactive
Web-delivered support condition will have heiQ scores within
0.29 of a SD of those in the proactive telephone-delivered
support condition.
Methods
Care Coordinator, Nurse, and Clinician Recruitment
As of June 1st, 2016, care coordinators, nurses, and clinicians
from 50 health services were committed to participating in the
study. A variety of recruitment techniques were used. Care
coordinators, nurses, and physicians also received study
information with a link to a Web-based expression of interest
(EOI) form via several national professional organizations such
as: the Lung Foundation Australia; the Clinical Oncology
Society of Australia; the Medical Oncology Group of Australia;
and the Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand.
Contacts were also identified through publicly available lists of
multidisciplinary teams or through personal connections with
research team members. Wherever possible, individuals received
a personalized email with an embedded link to the EOI form.
The research team contacted individuals who completed a
Web-based EOI and arranged a teleconference to gauge capacity
and willingness to participate in the study. No specific exclusion
criteria related to the size or location of the health service were
applied in order to represent the diversity of rural and urban
settings in which lung cancer patients may receive care.
Study Setting
All interventions will be delivered through 1 state-based CIS
service, the Cancer Council New South Wales (CCNSW). In
usual practice, clients would be automatically connected to the
CIS service in their state of residence. A study-specific telephone
number and email address will be set up to permit isolation of
study participants from other CIS clients. A directory of
state-specific services will be created to ensure participants from
areas outside of New South Wales can receive the information
relevant to their local areas.
CIS consultants are qualified oncology and/or psychosocial
health professionals (ie, nurses, social workers, counsellors).
Consultants receive extensive training in supportive care
principles and therapeutic communication skills. As part of their
ongoing training, consultants routinely participate in clinical
supervision and 
professional development workshops;
furthermore, a sample of calls are regularly reviewed by a
service manager as part of performance evaluations. A total of
6 CIS consultants will participate and are trained to deliver both
the telephone- and Web-based interventions.

Participant Eligibility Criteria
Individuals will be eligible to participate if they: are 18 years
or older; have a primary diagnosis of any lung cancer type
(including mesothelioma); are less than 4 months post diagnosis;
have an approximate life expectancy of at least 6 months; and
have current Internet access via any type of device including
shared access or public access (eg, via a family member or
public library).
Patient Recruitment and Consent Procedure
Eligible lung cancer outpatients will be identified and
approached by health professionals (care coordinators, nurses,
or clinicians) and will be recruited in 1 of 3 ways:
Full consent process completed in clinic settings immediately:
during patients’ appointments, clinic staff or a research assistant
(depending on the clinic’s preference) will ask the patient
whether they have Internet access, provide study information
materials to eligible patients (including a baseline survey), and
invite them to participate in the study. Participants will complete
a written consent form in clinic and can choose to complete the
survey in-clinic or at home.
Consent for further contact completed in clinic settings
immediately, with full consent process completed by a research
team member: during patients’ appointments, clinic staff will
ask whether they have Internet access and if they would be
interested in being contacted by the research team regarding the
study. Interested patients will complete a consent form that
allows the clinic to forward the patient’s contact details to the
research team. Once consent forms are forwarded to the research
team, patients will be contacted via their preferred mode of
contact to discuss possible study participation. Up to 2 follow-up
contacts will be made to nonrespondents. Patients who would
like to participate will complete a separate consent form, which
will be posted along with the baseline survey.
Full consent process completed outside of the clinic setting by
a health professional: health professionals, typically care
coordinators, will mail information booklets and make follow-up
telephone calls to patients as part of standard care procedures.
As part of these standard contacts, study materials (information
statement, consent form, and baseline survey) will be included
in the mail-out package, and the health professional will discuss
the study when making calls to patients.
Randomization Process and Blinding
Stratified block randomization will be completed by the research
team using a Web-based random number generator program
immediately upon receiving a completed consent form. All
participants will complete the baseline survey prior to
randomization. Randomization will be by patient, with analyses
accounting for clustering of outcomes by CIS consultant. The
randomized list of patients will then be given daily to the CIS
service to contact participants using the allocated approach
method (mailed booklet, telephone call, or email/live chat). Due
to the nature of the interventions, patients and CIS consultants
will not be blinded to the allocation arm; health professionals
will not be informed of participants’ allocation. Those
responsible for data analysis and interpretation will be blind to
group allocation. There is no foreseeable circumstance in which
revealing a participant's group allocation to data analysts would
be required.
Interventions
Participants will be randomized to 1 of 3 arms: (1) a booklet
from the Cancer Council which contains the CCNSW CIS
service details (minimal ethical care (control)), (2) phone call(s)
from the CCNSW CIS service (proactive telephone-delivered
support), or (3) email(s) and live chat consultation from the
CCNSW CIS service (proactive Web-delivered support). See
Figure 1 for brief description with data collection time-points.
Arm 1: Minimal Ethical Care (Control)
Patients will be mailed a booklet (“Understanding Lung
Cancer”) from the CCNSW. The booklet will contain the CIS
service telephone number and email address. Although lung
cancer accounts for 9% of all new cancers diagnosed, lung
cancer patients account for only 1% of calls received by the CIS
service. Therefore, it is not expected that a high proportion of
the control group will contact the service independently. Any
potential contamination via calls to the CIS service from this

 group will be identified using questions in the follow-up survey
and by reviewing internal CIS records.
Arm 2: Proactive Telephone-Delivered Support
The CIS model is tailored to callers’ needs rather than following
a manualized protocol as may be the case for delivery of some
therapies such as CBT. The patient consent form will request
contact details and preferred times to call. The research team
will provide this information to the CCNSW CIS service and
patients randomized to this intervention arm will receive a 20-50
minute outbound call from a trained consultant within a few
days of the CIS service receiving their contact details. The CIS
consultant will make multiple attempts (up to 5 calls made at
varying times and weekdays) to establish contact with the
patient. Following the initial discussion, the CIS consultant will
also offer an additional, subsequent call-out. Following the
completion of the 2 proactive calls from the CIS, patients in
this group can initiate further contact if desired.
Call Content
Call content will reflect usual care and will follow the CIS
model, in which the call is guided by patients’ individual needs
with 3 main types of support available: informational, emotional,
and instrumental. Emotional support involves communication
of caring and concern, and is argued to reduce distress by
improving self-esteem and encouraging the expression of
feelings [34,35]. Informational support is thought to enhance
perceptions of control by reducing confusion and providing
patients with strategies to cope with their difficulties [34,35];
in addition to the verbal information exchanged over the course
of a call, specific examples of the informational support provided
by the CIS includes: reference to Web-based videos and Web
seminars; provisions of paper-based information packages; and
access to a cancer service directory. Instrumental support
involves the provision of tangible goods such as transportation,
money, or physical assistance and leads to a decrease in feelings
of loss of control [34,35]. Specific examples of instrumental
support offered by the CIS service includes: linking callers with
services in their local area; financial grants; transportation
grants; and subsidized accommodation. CIS service manuals
detailing the 3 main types of support are available upon request.
Repeated contact with the same CIS consultant is preferred but
not always achieved as a matter of course.
Arm 3: Proactive Web-Delivered Support.
Participants allocated to this intervention arm will be contacted
within a few days of randomization via email and a hard copy
letter. The letter and email will explain the available electronic
options for support (email delivered or Web-based typed live
chat) and provide the study-specific Web-link needed for
intervention access. Participants will be able to use either or
both modes of electronic contact according to their preference.
If participants have not engaged with either electronic option
within 2 weeks of allocation, subsequent telephone calls (up to
5 calls made at varying times and weekdays) will be conducted
by the research team to confirm the participant has received the
information and to provide additional instructions if needed.
Usual CIS service content (as described above) will be provided
via typed rather than spoken communication, using email and
Web-based chat. Equivalence of telephone- and Web-delivered
content and quality will be examined via 5-10 simulated clients
using standardized vignettes. These telephone and Web
conversations will be transcribed. The transcriptions will BE
reviewed by senior research team members with the content
compared with a quality checklist developed in collaboration
with CIS representatives according to their current evaluation
practices. This process will occur at 3 time-points in the
intervention phase and will also serve as a fidelity measure. To
ensure the majority of consultants are included in this
equivalence test, it may be necessary to complete up to 10
simulations.
CIS consultants will receive training and a detailed manual on
the features of the Web system, including ways to convey
emotional support, such as empathetic responses using typed
text. This manual is available upon request. Multimedia
Appendices 1 and 2 provide screenshot examples of the
instructions and simulated Web-based chat conversation between
a member of the research team and CCNSW consultant.
Following their first electronic session, participants will be
offered an additional email contact from the CIS service. Similar
to the other intervention arm, participants in this group can
initiate further electronic contact if desired. Continuity of care
(ie, contact from the same consultant) may not always occur.
Any potential contamination via calls to the CIS service from
the Web-support group will be identified using questions in the
follow-up survey and by reviewing internal CIS records.
Measures
The baseline and follow-up measures listed below will be
collected via pen-and-paper surveys; this data will be securely
stored according to approved procedures. The follow-up points
for patients will be 3 and 6 months post recruitment, as
approximately 60% of lung cancer patients have a life
expectancy of less than 12 months [2]. Participants who do not
return a survey within 2 weeks will receive a reminder letter
and an additional survey package. A research team member will
telephone nonresponders 2 weeks following the first reminder
letter. All survey variables, including data collection time-points,
are listed in Table 1.

Primary Patient Outcomes
The GHQ-12 is a widely used, self-report screening measure
of general psychological distress [40]. The 12-item measure
takes 2 minutes to complete and assesses an individual’s
perception of their health in terms of their ability to: play a
useful part; make decisions; overcome difficulties; enjoy normal
activities; face problems; and to feel confident, worthwhile, and
happy [41]. The time-frame of the GHQ-12 covers the last 4
weeks and items are scored using a 4-point scale (“better than
usual,” “same as usual,” “less than usual,” and “much less than
usual”) [42]. Half of the items are worded positively, and the
other half negatively. Items can be scored using either a Binary
scale (0-1, maximum score = 12) or Likert scale (0-3, maximum
score = 36), with a higher score indicating higher psychological
distress [42]. The GHQ-12 has excellent internal consistency
(Cronbach’s alphas above 0.82 for cancer patients) and
test-retest reliability [41]. The measure has also been validated
in the general Australian community and with cancer
populations, including patients with a history of lung cancer
[41-44].
Participants who indicate severe levels of distress (scores > 20
on the GHQ-12) at either the baseline, 3, or 6 months survey
will be mailed a letter encouraging them to discuss their feelings
with their doctor. Contact details of available support services
will also be provided.

 The heiQ is an Australian-developed tool for assessing the
efficacy and impact of health education and self-management
programs for people with chronic diseases [45]. Its 42 items are
closely aligned to the nature of the CIS service and map to 8
domains: (1) health-directed behavior, (2) positive and active
engagement in life, (3) emotional well-being, (4) self-monitoring
and insight, (5) constructive attitudes and approaches, (6) skill
and technique acquisition, (7) social integration and support,
and (8) health service navigation. Respondents indicate the
degree to which they agree or disagree with each item on a
4-point scale. Standardized subscale scores (from 1-4) are
calculated, with higher scores indicating better functioning.
The heiQ was developed using Structural Equation Modelling
and Item Response Theory. It has demonstrated reliability and
validity among people with a wide range of chronic diseases
and demographic characteristics and sensitivity to change as a
result of intervention [45,46].
Secondary Patient Outcome
Two subscales of the 34-item Supportive Care Needs Survey
(SCNS-SF34) will be used to assess unmet needs [47]. The scale
assesses cancer-specific perceived needs across 5, factor
analytically derived domains. The 2 relevant domains for this
study are: (1) health systems and information, and (2) patient
care and support [47]. Respondents indicate their level of need
for help over the last month on a 5-point Likert scale.
Standardized domain scores ranging from 0 to 100 can be
calculated. The SCNS-SF34 has Cronbach’s alphaS greater than
0.86 for each subscale, and is moderately correlated with other
measures of psychosocial morbidity [47].
Patient Process Measures
Process data will include: number of contacts made to and
received from the CIS service; utilization of specific information
and support services; acceptability of the information and
support provided; and perceived skill level of the CIS consultant.
All participants will provide this information at 6 months.
Excepting initial telephone calls to participants who do not
engage with one of the Web-delivered support options within
2 weeks of group allocation, no additional strategies will be
used to increase use of the telephone or Web arms as uptake
rates (with consideration of differential use by demographic
characteristics) is an important indicator of the intervention
acceptability.
Antecedent and Moderating Factors
Participants will complete additional survey items to account
for sociodemographic, disease and treatment, and social support
characteristics, which may moderate the intervention effects.
Table 1 outlines these survey items, along with all study data
items, and the time-point at which this information will be
collected.
Sample Size
The sample size calculation is based on the post-hoc contrasts.
The comparison of each intervention group with minimal ethical
care is a superiority analysis, whereas the comparison of the 2
intervention arms of the study is a noninferiority analysis.
The study aims to recruit 501 subjects, and therefore complete
data will be available for approximately 375 patients (125 per
arm) at 6 months with an estimated 25% (125/501 participants)
lost to follow-up. This sample size will provide the study with
more than 80% power to detect a difference between each of
the intervention groups and the control group of 0.35 SD at an
alpha level of 0.01 assuming the correlation between baseline
and follow-up scores is at least 0.7. This sample size will also
provide the study with 90% power to claim noninferiority in
the comparison between the 2 interventions if the true underlying
difference between the groups is 0.29 SDs for either the heiQ
or GHQ-12. A meta-analysis of Web-based emotional support
reported an average effect size of approximately 0.4 across 15
studies [48]; similarly, previous research found modest effect
sizes of 0.3-0.5 on the heiQ in self-management interventions
in Australian and hospital-based samples [49,50]. The age group
and gender of nonparticipants will be compared with that of
participants to assess nonconsent bias.
Statistical Analysis
Primary analysis will compare scores on the GHQ-12 and 5 key
heiQ dimensions (emotional support and well-being; monitoring
and insight; constructive attitudes; skill acquisition; health
service navigation) at a 6-month follow-up across the 3 groups.
Differences between treatment groups on each of GHQ-12 and
heiQ scores at the 6-month follow-up will be tested using
analysis of covariance. The outcomes in the models will be the
GHQ-12 score and heiQ score of interest at 6 months, the main
predictor of interest will be treatment group and the baseline
value of the GHQ-12 score and heiQ score will be included as
covariates. Three post-hoc contrasts will be carried out; the first
2 of these will compare separately each of the intervention
groups with the control group and the third will compare the
proactive telephone-delivered support with the proactive
Web-delivered support. To account for Type I error in the
post-hoc analyses, Bonferroni corrections will be applied.
Results
It is hypothesized that participants receiving telephone or Web
support will report reduced distress and greater self-efficacy
than participants receiving booklets. Furthermore, individuals
receiving Web support will report heiQ scores within 0.29 SDs
of individuals receiving telephone support. Participant
recruitment is underway and will conclude in September 2017.
This study has been approved by the Hunter New England
Human Research Ethics Committee (NHMRC Committee Code:
EC00403; Reference No. 14/05/21/4.03); the University of
Newcastle Human Research Ethics Committee (NHMRC
Committee Code: EC00144; Reference No. H-2014-0240); and,
the Cancer Council of New South Wales (NHMRC Committee
Code: EC00345; Reference No. 291). The study has also been
approved by local research governance committees at each
participating health service. This trial was registered with the
Australian 
New 
Zealand 
Clinical 
Trials 
Registry
(ACTRN12615000932561) and received funding from the
National Health and Medical Research Council as a Partnership
Project.

 Discussion
Trial Outcomes
Lung cancer patients often experience poorer prognosis, more
severe physical effects, and more pronounced psychosocial
distress than patients with other major cancers. A highly
accessible 
and 
sustainable 
source 
of 
personalized
community-based support would be invaluable for cancer
patients and may minimize the need for more intensive and
costly hospital-based services. This proposed trial aims to
address 3 key issues that are largely unaddressed within the
current literature: (1) how to engage patients who may benefit
from, but underutilize, the service, (2) whether the model of
low-intensity information, support, and referral is effective in
improving relevant psychosocial outcomes in the ‘real world’
context, and (3) whether Web-based modes of support are
acceptable to, and beneficial for, patients.
The proposed combination of active recruitment to the CCNSW
CIS service, and the availability of Web-based options in the
present study, has the potential to greatly increase the
accessibility and continuity of supportive care for cancer
patients. A positive outcome for this trial will be to produce an
evidence base for redesigning the CIS service to be both
effective and responsive to patient needs, in line with the
national health reform’s core principle of patient-centered care
and increasing focus on eHealth options [51]. This evidence
will also be applicable to a number of international organizations
who provide community-based support services based on the
CIS model.
Relevance to Other Community-Based Support
Services
The findings from the rigorous examination of the efficacy of
low-intensity information and support models of the CIS service
are likely to be applicable to, and thus inform, other telephone
services that provide similar support to many Australians. These
important services, such as Lifeline, Salvo Care Line, Kids Help
Line, Mensline, Beyondblue, SANE, Dementia Helpline,
Hepatitis Helpline, and Stroke Helpline, are often the foremost
services that are widely available to people experiencing a range
of distressing and traumatic experiences, and therefore contribute
significantly to the mental and social fabric of Australia.
