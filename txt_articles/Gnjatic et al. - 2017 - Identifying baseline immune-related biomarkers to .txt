Abstract
As cancer strikes, individuals vary not only in terms of factors that contribute to its occurrence and development,
but as importantly, in their capacity to respond to treatment. While exciting new therapeutic options that mobilize
the immune system against cancer have led to breakthroughs for a variety of malignancies, success is limited to a
subset of patients. Pre-existing immunological features of both the host and the tumor may contribute to how
patients will eventually fare with immunotherapy. A broad understanding of baseline immunity, both in the
periphery and in the tumor microenvironment, is needed in order to fully realize the potential of cancer
immunotherapy. Such interrogation of the tumor, blood, and host immune parameters prior to treatment is
expected to identify biomarkers predictive of clinical outcome as well as to elucidate why some patients fail to
respond to immunotherapy. To approach these opportunities for progress, the Society for Immunotherapy of
Cancer (SITC) reconvened the Immune Biomarkers Task Force. Comprised of an international multidisciplinary panel
of experts, Working Group 4 sought to make recommendations that focus on the complexity of the tumor
microenvironment, with its diversity of immune genes, proteins, cells, and pathways naturally present at baseline
and in circulation, and novel tools to aid in such broad analyses.

Background
Immunogenic cancers persist despite the presence of
tumor-specific adaptive immune responses through in-
tricate interactions between tumor cells and the host im-
mune response within the tumor microenvironment
(TME). The presence of pre-existing local adaptive im-
munity has been associated with positive outcomes in a
variety of malignancies [1, 2], and as such, initiatives to
overcome immune escape and subsequently enhance im-
mune function have been at the forefront of the cancer
immunotherapy
field.
Several
recent
efforts
have
invested in understanding how the immune cell context
within the TME can act either as a predictive or prog-
nostic factor in response to a given therapy, or guide
combination partner selection and improve clinical out-
comes [3]. As data from ongoing clinical trials with
checkpoint inhibitors and other immuno-oncology drugs
become more widely available [4, 5], understanding the
complex relationships between immune and tumor cells
within the tumor tissue promises to help us understand
how to better convert non-inflamed to inflamed tumors
and address immune escape [6, 7].
With regard to prognostic biomarkers, compelling evi-
dence from multiple studies has revealed that infiltration
by leukocyte subsets such as CD8+ and CD45RO+
memory T cells with specific cytokine signatures (e.g.,
dense infiltration by immunohistochemistry or a cyto-
toxic gene profiling) and perhaps B cells too, is linked
with
favorable
outcome
in
a
variety
of
cancers,

 regardless of potential immunotherapeutic intervention
[1, 8–11]. In a landmark colorectal cancer study, adap-
tive immune cell infiltration was shown to have a prog-
nostic value superior to the classical extension and
invasion tumor criteria [1, 12]. A resulting “immuno-
score” quantifying the density of CD3+ and CD8+ T cells
in the tumor center and its invasive margin was pro-
posed as a novel immune classification colorectal tumors
[1, 13]. Similar information has been available in other
cancers such as melanoma where tumor infiltrating lym-
phocytes have been recognized to be of prognostic and
predictive utility for 20 years [14], which have been rein-
forced by the findings of The Cancer Genome Atlas
[15]. Involvement of other subsets, such as regulatory T
cells (Treg) and macrophages, has been investigated,
showing that they can confer either good or poor prog-
nosis depending on context [9, 16]. Immune signatures
associated with immune-mediated tissue destruction
(e.g., genes, proteins, or cells related to cytotoxicity), or
conversely genetic or histological signatures associated
with immune suppression, will influence the immune
contexture. Thus, a continuum exists, tilting the balance
towards either tumor cell growth or elimination, gov-
erned by pre-existing immunosurveillance [17]. This
context is where treatment with immunomodulatory
drugs act, helping to further shift the scale against
cancer.
The remarkable clinical successes of multiple new im-
munotherapeutic strategies in the last 6 years have
largely relied on targeting suppressive mechanisms af-
fecting T cells. This is particularly the case for check-
point
inhibitors, such as the US Food
and Drug
Administration
(FDA)-approved
antibodies
targeting
cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4)
[5] and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its
ligand, PD-L1 [4, 18, 19]. The identification of predictive
biomarkers is likely to be the most fruitful if we can
understand pre-existing antitumor immune profiles, by
interrogating the TME for T cells [20], the antigens they
target including neoantigens, and suppressive intrinsic
and extrinsic factors affecting them. The best studied
predictive biomarker of immunotherapy is the PD-1/PD-
L1 inhibitory axis, where tumor expression of PD-L1 by
some tumors may correlate with better clinical response
to treatment with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies
[21]. Co-localization of PD-L1 expression within an in-
flamed TME suggests that PD-L1 expression is upregu-
lated
in
the
setting of
an
endogenous
anti-tumor
immune response [22, 23]. PD-1/PD-L1 blockade ap-
pears to result in enhancement of the localized inflam-
matory response with further PD-L1 upregulation in
responding patients [20, 23]. Moreover, the phenotype of
tumor-antigen specific infiltrating lymphocytes within
the TME suggests that the majority of these cells reside
within the PD-1 positive fraction [24–27]. The demon-
strated clinical impact of checkpoint inhibition on pa-
tient outcomes notwithstanding, absolute predictors of a
tumor response based on immune infiltration have yet
to be defined. Accumulating exceptions such as lack of
response to treatment in some patients, the incomplete
correlation between PD-L1 expression and clinical ef-
fectiveness of PD-1 blockade [4, 28, 29], and the coun-
terexamples
in renal
cell
carcinoma in
which
the
presence of T cells is generally associated with poor out-
come [30] indicate that a more comprehensive profiling
of local immune cells and of their function is warranted.
Efforts to profile tumor-infiltrating immune cells how-
ever often have inherent limitations in sample availability
and technological capability, thus restricting investiga-
tions
into
the
local
immune
response.
New
tools
equipped to ask more complex questions have led inves-
tigators to revisit old observations as well as to pursue
new lines of inquiry from peripheral blood as well. For T
cells, considered as the major mediators of antitumor ac-
tivity, efforts to characterize their specificity are critical,
from defining shared antigens to identifying mutation-
derived neoepitopes. Accordingly, the use of various
tests of T cell specificity, functionality, clonality, or di-
versity may inform us on spontaneous tumor immuno-
genicity and provide a surrogate for potential antitumor
effector function. For B cells, early autologous typing
studies and advanced microarray profiling of cancer pa-
tient sera have demonstrated that circulating antibodies
to tumor-derived antigens arise in response to cancer
development or progression [31, 32]. While there is still
no routinely used test for circulating antibodies with
predictive value in cancer, some have proposed using
serum antibodies to tumor antigens such as p53 or
MUC1 as diagnostic markers [33], and others such as
NY-ESO-1 as prognostic indicators of higher grade and
larger tumor mass [34].
Other peripheral markers that may reflect informative
aspects of the TME remain to be explored. For example,
preclinical evidence supports a key role for myeloid-
derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in the control of cancer
progression, either by inhibiting adaptive and innate im-
munity against cancer or by affecting basic steps of
tumor development, such as neoangiogenesis, local and
metastatic spread, and cancer stemness [35, 36]. MDSC
presence and frequency in the blood of tumor patients
might represent a novel and simple biomarker to moni-
tor clinical outcome and response to therapy [37]. How-
ever, the specificity for cancer is not absolute since
MDSC can also expand under noncancerous conditions,
such as sepsis, bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections,
autoimmunity, and in aging individuals [35, 36].
In addition to local and peripheral tumor immunity, host-
related factors, including single nucleotide polymorphisms
Gnjatic et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2017) 5:44 
Page 2 of 18
 (SNP), also contribute to the still elusive “immunocompe-
tence” status of cancer patients toward their tumor. The
integration of powerful technologies such as genome-wide
association studies (GWAS), multiplex immunohisto-
chemistry (IHC), and mass cytometry is expected to aid in
our interpretation of such increasingly complex questions
at the genetic, molecular, and cellular levels from which
we might better predict therapeutic benefit. Collectively,
pre-existing tissue and peripheral immune-related bio-
markers in the context of host factors are poised to inform
researchers and clinicians about the immune competence
and likelihood of response in cancer patients undergoing
immunotherapy. Here, we will discuss these aforemen-
tioned aspects of clinical outcome prediction based on
measures of baseline immunity in the TME and in blood,
and make recommendations for the future of this field.
Biomarkers at the tissue site prior to treatment
How the tumor microenvironment at a cellular level
determines therapeutic approaches
Prognostic markers evaluating individual patient out-
come, such as recurrence of disease or death, independ-
ent of therapy, range from simple measures, including
stage of disease based on tumor invasion, to progres-
sively more comprehensive indicators encompassing the
biological complexity of the disease [12, 38]. Indeed, the
evolution of cancer is greatly influenced by the complex
milieu in which it develops, accommodating intricate
tumor-cell interactions within the host microenviron-
ment including a vast catalogue of cells, vessels, cyto-
kines, and chemokines. Histological analysis of human
tumors has highlighted the importance of tumor im-
mune
infiltrates
including
macrophages,
DC,
poly-
morphonuclear cells, natural killer (NK) cells, B cells,
and T cells, revealing a broad patient-to-patient diversity
[13]. Among an increasing variety of investigations sup-
porting the relevance of the differential presence of im-
mune system components in determining the evolution
of cancer [39], a predominant theme based on direct hu-
man observations collectively suggests that high dens-
ities of TIL correlate with improved clinical outcome
[13]. The correlation between a robust lymphocyte infil-
tration and better patient survival has been well docu-
mented in melanoma, ovarian, head and neck, breast,
urothelial, colorectal, lung, hepatocellular, esophageal
cancer, and brain metastases [9, 40]. The majority of
studies observed that high densities of CD3+ T cells,
CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), and CD45RO+
memory T cells are associated with a longer disease-free
survival (DFS) and/or improved OS. Thus, the role of
the adaptive immune response in controlling tumor pro-
gression is becoming increasingly appreciated. Although
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are often dysfunctional,
their
presence indicates that there is no systemic
inhibition of recruitment. These prognostic immune pa-
rameters have been comprehensively described as the
immune contexture, and define a novel paradigm for
cancer. Chemo-attraction and adhesion were shown to
play critical roles in determining the density of intra-
tumoral immune cells. Expression of specific chemokine
signatures correlated with differing densities and spatial
localization of T cell subpopulations within tumor re-
gions, and with specific TCR repertoires predicting pa-
tient survival [41]. Local proliferation of CD8+ T cells
mediated through the expression of IL15 was also dem-
onstrated as a mechanism leading to increased CTL
density [42]. High expression levels of these immune-
related genes were associated with prolonged disease-
free survival (DFS) in patients with colorectal cancer,
and long-term OS correlated with these immune gene
signatures [41]. Similar gene expression profiles were
also observed in additional studies [43–48].
An international consortium was organized to validate
and promote the use of Immunoscore in routine clinical
settings [49, 50]. Immunoscore has a prognostic value in
early-stage patients [51], as well as in late-stage patients
such as patients with brain metastases [40]. To be used
globally in a routine manner, evaluation of a novel
marker should be: routine, feasible, simple, rapid, robust,
reproducible, objective, specific, quantitative, standardized,
powerful, and preferentially pathology IHC-based. Immu-
noscore has the potential to fulfill these key criteria. In
addition, Immunoscore provides a tool for novel thera-
peutic approaches, including immunotherapy [4, 5, 18, 19].
The findings of this international consortium may result in
the implementation of the Immunoscore as a new com-
ponent for the classification of cancer, designated
TNM-I (TNM-Immune).
Multiplex IHC in clinically annotated material
Initial reports defining the clinical impact of tumor in-
filtration by immune cells, such as the Immunoscore,
have recognized that while the high density of memory
CD8+ T cells may predict long-term survival of colon
cancer patients, it is equally important to address the
location and functional differentiation of such cells,
whether inside the tumor itself or in surrounding stro-
mal areas [1, 9, 52]. Beyond localization, evidence is
mounting that solid tumors harbor a variety of immu-
nocytes beyond T cells that may be associated with
good or poor outcome. Therefore, defining only one or
two immune markers is unlikely to be sufficient, and
multiparametric approaches are needed to comprehen-
sively assess immune profiling of cells within the tissue
architecture from baseline.
Recent advances in tumor tissue multiplex IHC tech-
nologies aim to provide insights into the nature of tumor
immune infiltration with respect to the type, number,
Gnjatic et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2017) 5:44 
Page 3 of 18
 and qualitative characteristics of the immune cells
present, as well as their interactions with the tumor and
stromal cells as a correlate to disease progression and
prognosis. Multiplex IHC offers the unique opportunity
to dissect the dynamic interactions between immune
cells and the TME. However, undertaking such multi-
parametric analyses has been met with various techno-
logical and biological challenges [53]. For instance,
multiplexing applications have been limited by which
antibodies can be combined without cross-reactivity, in-
sufficient specificity of some reagents, and confounded
by spatial co-expression of some antigens that may inter-
fere with precise interpretations of results. These prob-
lems are compounded by the limited availability of
overlapping chromogenic agents. Despite these hurdles,
the use of fluorescently-labeled antibodies offers im-
proved multiplexing capabilities, and advances are being
made to reuse fluorescent or chromogen-stained slides
multiple times for consecutive analyses on the same
tissue [54, 55].
IHC assessments have generally utilized two to three
markers simultaneously, with additional staining under-
taken on separate serial sections if more markers were
required [56, 57]. Most of the duplex or triplex IHC as-
says to date employ chromogenic tools since this is a
well-established approach in visualizing several antigens.
Tumeh et al. reported an increased CD8+ T cell density
in post-treatment serial biopsies from responding melan-
oma patients treated with pembrolizumab [20]. Further-
more, additional functional characterization is usually
acquired by molecular profiling in serial sections. For in-
stance, biopsies of patients responding favorably to
checkpoint inhibition show an increased number of pro-
liferating CD8+ T cells associated with increased levels
of PD-L1 expression as assayed by IHC and an increased
IFNγ signature as determined by gene expression profil-
ing [23, 58]. Moreover, a high tumor-infiltrating lympho-
cyte (TIL) presence and PD-L1 expression determined
by IHC correlated with IFNγ-producing immune cells
identified by qRT-PCR of laser micro-dissected speci-
mens [59].
To characterize the T cells in the TME for their speci-
ficity, technologies employed thus far with some degree
of success utilize either the recognition of antigen-
specific T cells by in situ major histocompatibility com-
plex (MHC) class I tetramer staining or TCR Vβ reper-
toire analysis [60, 61]. The wider applicability of the
former has been rather limited due to specificity con-
straints mostly against melanoma antigens. With re-
spect to the latter, this approach has enabled a positive
association of PD-1 expressing T cells and PD-L1 ex-
pressing cells in tumors determined by IHC with a
more restricted Vβ-chain usage as a response to pem-
brolizumab, highlighting the potential utility of this
approach [20]. Multiparametric IHC approaches are
now being utilized together with efforts to characterize
the mutational spectrum of the underlying TME in
order to characterize the immune responses they elicit,
as discussed next [60, 61].
Investing in advancing multiplex IHC technologies
utilizing fluorescence-, chromogen-, or heavy metal-
labeled antibodies that can maximize the use of the lim-
ited material available in a clinical setting could ensure a
“true” overlay of different immune markers and deter-
mination of marker co-expression. Coupling this IHC
technology with mutational profiling and gene expres-
sion patterns could offer a more comprehensive under-
standing of the TME and promises a future whereby
immune biomarkers could inform therapeutic choices in
order to improve clinical outcome of cancer immuno-
therapy treatments.
Gene expression at the tumor site
Since the introduction of expression microarray tech-
nologies, genes with specialized roles in immune cell
biology have been repeatedly observed to be highly
expressed components of tumor expression profiles of
some patients. Based on the coordinate expression
among these genes [62–66], their positive correlation
with histological measurements of TIL [15, 58, 62, 63],
and their enriched expression in immune cell lineages
[62], it is now widely accepted that these genes reflect
the relative abundance of various populations of tumor
infiltrating leukocytes. Consistent with this hypothesis,
numerous robust and reproducible associations between
immune gene signatures in solid tumors and clinical
outcomes have been reported. In aggressive subtypes of
breast cancer, gene signatures believed to reflect anti-
tumor involvement of T cells (CTL and Th cells) or B
cells (namely plasma cells) have been shown to exhibit
highly significant positive associations with OS and
recurrence-free survival of patients [62–64, 67–70], as
well as pathologic complete response in the neoadjuvant
setting [71–75]. In colorectal cancers, the expression of
genes believed to underlie CTL, Th cells, and B cells has
been associated significantly with prolonged recurrence-
free survival [76]. The tumor microenvironment and
Immunoscore were shown to be critical determinants of
dissemination to distant metastases [77]. Similarly, pro-
longed OS and distant metastasis-free survival has been
associated with the high expression of genes believed to
reflect T cell, B cell, and natural killer (NK) cell involve-
ment in metastatic melanoma [15, 78]. In most instances
the prognostic attributes of these immune gene signatures
remain significant in multivariate models, indicating that
they provide prognostic information not captured by con-
ventional prognostic factors such as tumor stage, grade,
size, and nodal status [62, 69, 71, 73, 78].

 In the context of immunotherapy, the predictive po-
tential of immune genes has been elucidated recently. In
a phase II clinical trial comparing ipilimumab doses in
metastatic melanoma, Ji et al., discovered that T cell-
related genes were significantly over-expressed in pre-
treatment biopsies of subjects with ipilimumab clinical
activity [58]. Among the genes were T cell surface
markers (CD8A, CD3, CD2, CD277, CD27, and CD38),
cytotoxic
factors
(PRF1
and
GZMB)
and
tissue
rejection-related cytokines and chemokines (CXCL9,
CXCL10, CXCL11, CCL4, and CCL5), all of which have
been observed as central components of previously de-
scribed prognostic and therapy-predictive immune gene
signatures [62, 63, 71, 72, 75]. In a phase II trial of re-
combinant MAGE-A3 protein in combination with dif-
ferent immune stimulants in metastatic melanoma,
Ulloa-Montoya et al. discovered an immune-related gene
signature that was associated with clinical benefit in
melanoma patients [79]. Similar to that discovered by Ji
et al., key genes of this signature included CD8A, CD3D,
CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL2, GZMK, and other
genes related to T cell function and immune signaling.
Intriguingly, the same gene signature significantly pre-
dicted favorable DFS in non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) patients treated with MAGE-A3 (plus AS02 im-
mune stimulant) but not those treated with placebo [79].
Together, these observations support the notion that
gene expression-based correlates of immune involve-
ment could hold valuable clinical utility for a number of
prognostic and therapy-predictive applications. However,
to date, mRNA-based diagnostics that quantify immune
involvement in tumors do not exist. Multi-gene diagnos-
tics that simultaneously measure mRNA transcripts of
multiple genes represent a class of In Vitro Diagnostic
Multivariate Index Assay (IVDMIA) that has in recent
years gained wide clinical acceptance for the diagnosis
and stratification of patients into risk groups to guide
therapeutic decisions [80, 81]. Such diagnostics are cur-
rently being developed on platforms engineered for high
sensitivity and specificity of mRNA detection and multi-
plex
capability
such
as
real-time
quantitative
PCR
(Oncotype DX test), expression microarrays (Mamma-
Print test), and the NanoString n-Counter platform
(Prosigna test). Unlike other clinical biomarkers that rely
on cell type-specific detection, multi-gene tests typically
quantify gene expression from whole tumor specimens.
Thus, a multi-gene IVDMIA might represent a suitable
context for the diagnostic development of immune gene
signatures. However, immune assessment from whole
tumor fragments carries potential advantages and disad-
vantages
compared
to
conventional
IHC-based
ap-
proaches. Immune analysis of whole tumor fragments
might provide a more representative sampling of the
distribution of immune cells throughout a tumor as
compared to a conventional two-dimensional tumor
section. Also, the quantification of a panel of immune
genes may have the advantage of objectivity and cost-
effectiveness as compared to more subjective strategies
for quantifying proteins in multiplicity by conventional
IHC. By contrast, transcript analysis in tumor fragments
could be confounded by admixed cell types, where the
diagnostic signal may be obscured by transcripts that are
not necessarily specific to the target cell population (i.e.,
transcripts expressed by both cancer and noncancerous
cells). New computational methods, however, such as
ESTIMATE [82] and CIBERSORT [83, 84] that utilize
cell-specific gene expression signatures to infer relative
fractions of immune and stromal cell populations from
whole tumor gene expression profiles are making pro-
gress toward this limitation. These methods employ de-
convolution and require next-generation sequencing
(NGS) of the tumor sample.
How the tumor microenvironment at a genetic level
determines therapeutic approaches
The ability to predict response to treatment is important
in all cancer therapies but particularly germane to
newly-approved agents where toxicity can be severe, and
cost plays a major role in treatment decisions. Small
molecule inhibitors of constitutively active tyrosine ki-
nases have radically changed the treatment paradigm for
lung cancer and chronic myelogenous leukemia. The im-
portance of genetic mutations in the efficacy of im-
munotherapy has only recently been highlighted and
these functional mutations are likely to become an inte-
gral part of tumor characterization at baseline for
immunogenicity.
Genetic mutations in tumors are associated with an
enhanced response rate to therapy with agents that tar-
get CTLA-4 and PD-1 [85, 86]. The highest response
rates to nivolumab and pembrolizumab are seen in
Hodgkin lymphoma and microsatellite unstable (MSI
high) colon cancer [87–89]. In Hodgkin lymphoma, PD-
L1 overexpression is the result of enhanced transcription
driven both by JAK2, PD-L1, and PD-L2 overexpression
caused by gene amplification on the chromosome 9
locus that encodes these genes. In MSI high colon can-
cer, mutations in the DNA repair mechanisms predis-
pose to colon cancer but also produce high rates of
mutations in other genes that can function as tumor an-
tigens. The efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade is
also high in patients with genetic mutations leading to
the generation of peptides that drive the expansion of T
cells that are either pre-existing or that can be generated
in response to bacterial, viral, or other immune stimuli
[85]. The existence of tumor reactive T cells in turn re-
sults in the production of cytokines such as TNFα and
IFNγ that upregulate the expression of PD-L1 in the
Gnjatic et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2017) 5:44 
Page 5 of 18
 TME. As expected, therefore, PD-L1 positive tumors
have response rates significantly higher than PD-L1 low
or negative tumors. The studies of pembrolizumab in
lung cancer separated therapeutic effects into three
groups based on the level of PD-L1 staining: those with
50% or greater positivity in tumor, 1-49% positive, and
less than 1% PD-L1 positive. The response rates were
45.2, 16.5, and 10.7%, respectively. Even higher response
rates are observed in patients with no prior therapy in
all three groups [86]. This observation suggests that
prior therapy may blunt the ability of the immune sys-
tem to produce tumor regression and highlights the
need to introduce immunotherapy earlier in the course
of disease to maximize benefit in inoperable disease; this
also forms the foundation of the rationale for adjuvant
applications of these agents in operable disease at high
risk of postoperative relapse.
PD-L1 expression identifies tumors that have an in-
creased likelihood of response to immune checkpoint
blockade, however 10–20% of the PD-L1 negative or low
tumors also respond [90]. This suggests that in some tu-
mors the T cells exist to make the tumors regress but
that their numbers are insufficient to drive PD-L1 ex-
pression in the tumor. It may be possible to determine
the patients whose tumors will become positive for PD-
L1 expression through the use of IFNγ administration.
In this regard it is interesting to remember the results of
the adjuvant use of IFNγ in patients with melanoma. In
the randomized trial of adjuvant IFNγ, there was both
increased recurrence rate, and earlier recurrence among
patients allocated to IFNγ therapy compared with pla-
cebo [91]. It is possible that the IFNγ production caused
PD-L1 upregulation in the tumor and subsequent en-
hanced tumor growth as a result of the resistance in-
duced by PD-L1 expression.
The outstanding results of nivolumab in Hodgkin
lymphoma may be due to constitutive PD-L1 expression.
Characterization of other tumors with similar amplifica-
tions on chromosome 9 may identify tumors of other
histological profiles with an enhanced rate of tumor
response.
Tumor antigens, mutational load and neoantigens
Identifying whether the presence of activated effector T
cells in the TME relates to T cells with a given antigen
specificity is a priority, given mounting evidence that the
tumor mutational load contributes to tumor immuno-
genicity and eventual destruction [85, 86]. Understand-
ing the specificity of T cells in tumors at baseline may
therefore be a key to immunotherapy’s success. However,
identifying immune responses to antigens unique to tu-
mors and not expressed on normal tissue can be cum-
bersome, even when targeting known shared tumor
antigens such as NY-ESO-1. An alternative approach is
to use mutational burden in tumors as a proxy for the
presence of T cell epitopes derived from neoantigens,
which are mutated peptides that arise in tumors but are
not present in the normal genome [92]. The identifica-
tion of novel neoantigens has recently become more
feasible with the use of whole exome sequencing. Next
generation sequencing of tumors to identify mutations
and the use of computer algorithms to identify mutated
peptides that bind to MHC molecules can help to select
the appropriate targets for T cell enhancement. Frame-
shift mutations in microsatellite-unstable tumors showed
genetic evidence of immunoediting, contained higher
densities of Th1 cells, effector-memory T cells, in situ
proliferating T cells, and inhibitory PD-1/PD-L1-express-
ing cells, had a high Immunoscore, and were infiltrated
with mutation-specific cytotoxic T cells [93]. Recent
findings support accumulating data that it is not singular
mutations that predict patients’ clinical outcome, but ra-
ther the presence of a high number of mutations and a
global T cell response in the TME [94].
Multiple types of cancer antigens have been character-
ized, including neoantigens such as those encoded by
mutations and viral antigens, self-proteins that are either
overexpressed or usually not expressed in most of the
adult body (e.g., cancer testis antigens), and tissue-
specific gene products in which the cancer affects a tis-
sue or cell type not essential for the life of the patient
(e.g., B cells, melanocytes, or the prostate). Furthermore,
antigenic peptides do not simply correspond to frag-
ments of conventional proteins, but rather result from
aberrant transcription, incomplete splicing, translation
of alternative or cryptic open reading frames, or post-
translational modifications. Proteasome peptide splicing
also represents another mechanism that increases the di-
versity of antigenic peptides presented to T cells [95].
Antigenic peptide processing is a complicated process
that involves a multitude of human leukocyte antigens
[92]. Cancer-associated aberrant protein O-glycosylation
can modify antigen processing and immune response
[96] and MHC class I–associated phosphopeptides are
the targets of memory-like immunity. Results point to a
role for phosphopeptide-specific immunity as a compo-
nent of tumor recognition and control [97]. Thus, be-
yond exome sequencing and point mutations, various
tumor alterations may lead to tumor-specific immunity
and multiple immune biomarkers are likely candidates
for
prediction
of
response
to
immune-checkpoint
therapies.
Interestingly, when focusing on clusters of mutations
that predict patient outcome there is growing evidence
that immune gene expression is an attractive candidate
[76]. Studies in colorectal cancer have shown that there
are many common germline mutations among tumors,
but neoantigen mutations are distinct between patients
Gnjatic et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2017) 5:44 
Page 6 of 18
 [98]. However, when comparing highly mutated tumors
to less mutated tumors it was revealed that tumors with
more mutations had a histological immune signature
consisting of depleted immunosuppressive cells and up-
regulated immune inhibitory molecules. Inversely, less
mutated tumors had amplified immunosuppressive cells,
downregulation of HLA molecules, and reduced expres-
sion of immune inhibitory molecules. Additionally, the
adaptive immune response is highly accurate at predict-
ing patient outcome [76]. This is particularly true for
genomic alterations in chemokines and cytokines related
to T cell trafficking and homeostasis. The adaptive im-
mune response is shaped by CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells,
B cells, and follicular helper T cells (Tfh) that help
organize lymphoid structures. IL-21 and IL-15 are part
of the gamma-chain cytokine family and are crucial for
the survival and proliferation of Tfh, CTL, and memory
T cells. Consequently, both IL-21 and IL-15 are being
used in clinical trials as immunotherapy for cancer.
Identification of the viral, bacterial, or other immuno-
gens that drive the proliferation of these cells could be
used to enhance an existing immune response or initiate
one that is lacking or absent. It is tempting to speculate
that the effect of Coley’s toxin was based not so much
on its effect on the innate immune system but rather
that it generated adaptive immunity with the ability to
cross react and recognize tumors as a result of such mu-
tations to generate tumor regression.
Peripheral biomarkers prior to treatment
To define the nature of the tumor microenvironment
prior to treatment, and its prognostic or predictive value,
it is critical to obtain tissues from surgery or from biop-
sies with sufficient material for immune biomarker ana-
lyses. However, this can often be challenging, due to
either accessibility, limited size of tumors, and time re-
quired for organizing and analyzing tumor tissue collec-
tion
potentially
resulting
in
significant
delays
in
treatment [99]. Consequently, analysis of readily access-
ible samples such as peripheral blood is essential for the
development of clinically useful biomarkers.
To date, no validated FDA-approved circulatory im-
munological biomarker exists for patients with cancer,
despite technical advances in genomic, proteomic, and
metabolomics. Still, biomarkers from peripheral blood
would be ideal to provide clinical guidance and to incorp-
orate into routine clinical practice due to accessibility. A
number of strategies and techniques have been used to
explore the applicability of circulating biomarkers, in-
cluding the functional status of tumor specific T cells,
CD8+ T cell differentiation and sensitivity to apoptosis,
levels of circulating immunological mediators, miRNA,
and tumor-derived exosomes [100–106]. We explore
below strategies in development for immune-related
baseline biomarkers of immunotherapy.
High-dimensional blood profiling of immune cells-can this
be a window into the tissue microenvironment?
The impact of immunotherapeutic agents on peripheral
blood markers has been documented. For example, dur-
ing the clinical development of the antibody targeting
CTLA-4, ipilimumab, it was quickly identified that
CTLA-4 blockade resulted in upregulation of HLA-DR
and ICOS by T cells in both the TME and the blood
[107–109]. These findings, however, have been primarily
shown to be pharmacodynamic markers rather than
clinically useful predictive biomarkers for therapeutic
decision-making. It is therefore critical to sample the
periphery in a high-dimensional manner to look for im-
mune subsets that may be associated with immune fit-
ness at baseline, or to find representative immune actors
from the tumor milieu in circulation, for their pro- or
anti-tumor activity.
To assess potential pre-existing blood-based cellular
biomarkers, fluorescence flow cytometry has become the
immunologist’s tool of choice for the analysis of immune
cell populations. The technology has become increas-
ingly democratized by the availability of cytometers at
reasonable cost. In addition, the wide array of antibodies
specific for cell-surface proteins, MHC/peptide multi-
mers and intracellular phosphoproteins and cytokines al-
lows for multiparameter analysis of rare immune cell
subsets. While detection of eight markers in a sample is
well established for flow cytometry, overlap of the emis-
sion spectra of fluorescent antibody labels can present
challenges for the analysis of some combinations. The
recent development of mass cytometry or cytometry by
time-of-flight (CyTOF) for multiparameter single cell
analysis, which uses heavy metal ions as antibody labels,
overcomes the many limitations of fluorescence-based
flow cytometry. CyTOF has very little overlap between
channels and no background, allowing for as many as 40
labels
per
sample.
Consequently,
CyTOF
is
being
employed to analyze the profile and function of immune
populations in a comprehensive manner [110–114].
Efforts are underway to find measurements in blood
that may correlate, or at least approximate findings from
the tumor tissue site. Clinical examples of correlations
between circulating blood and tumor MDSC levels at
baseline have been described in several tumor types
[115]. Though typically not sufficient to predict outcome
alone, peripheral immune markers may be of use in the
context of specific immunotherapies, including vaccines.
Recently, the concept of “peripheral immunoscore” has
been proposed as a predictive baseline biomarker in two
different cohorts receiving cancer vaccines [116].
Gnjatic et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2017) 5:44 
Page 7 of 18
 Though rare, tumor neoantigen-specific T cell clono-
types have been identified in the circulation of cancer
patients [86, 117, 118]. Moreover, with the growth of
adoptive immunotherapy trials, both chimeric antigen
receptor and T cell receptor (TCR) transduced T cells
that traffic to the tumor and then recirculate are avail-
able for analysis. Therefore, tumor-reactive lymphocytes
in the circulation can be sampled and interrogated
through multiparameter immunophenotypic analysis as
a step toward biomarker development. The use of flow
cytometry in adoptive cell transfer studies has identified
biomarkers associated with persistence, the establish-
ment of antitumor memory, and improved clinical out-
comes [119–121]. Recently published observations also
confirm that PD-1 expression by peripheral lymphocytes
correlates with tumor burden, and the impact of in vivo
PD-1 engagement can be measured on circulating T cells
and serve as a biomarker for response to immunother-
apy [122, 123].
Immunoprofiling of antigen-stimulated blood, super-
natant multiplex analysis and complements in tissue
biopsies
Several studies are pointing toward a correlation with
peripheral immunological parameters indicative of im-
proved activation or restoration of local tumor immune
functions [57, 58, 124, 125]. It would be expected that
predictive circulating biomarkers will include markers of
increased Type 1 immunity and cytotoxic cell activity,
akin to the correlates of improved survival at the tumor
site identified in the immunocontexture of cancer [1, 9].
These may include cytokines (including IFNγ, IL-12, IL-2)
and chemokines (such as CXCR3 and CCR5 ligands)
associated with tumor trafficking, promoting the IFNγ
pathway, and stimulating cytotoxic functions [17]. On
the other side of the equation, disruption of immuno-
suppressive pathways characteristic of the TME, such
as indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), induction of
MDSC, and immunoregulatory pathways may also be
relevant.
Multiplex analysis of immunological mediators in
blood allows for the rapid quantification of a large range
of circulating analytes in small volumes of samples. This
approach provides an important source of data to iden-
tify predictive biomarkers in cancer patients and direct
therapeutic options. Unfortunately, despite extensive use
in clinical cancer research over the last decades, no vali-
dated results for either diagnosis or prognosis have been
obtained. Recently, the NIH/NIAID and the Cancer
Immunotherapy Consortium of the Cancer Research
Institute have developed a collaboration to monitor
proficiency testing in 25 selected sites worldwide and
identify variables with the aim to reach standardization
of this platform [126]. In the meantime, additional
approaches are now being considered, including whole
blood collection and stimulation platforms, which may
provide further insight and aid in the identification of
relevant biomarkers.
A recently developed approach to measure cytokine
production from small amounts of blood may provide
additional information by capturing peripheral immune
cell activity ex vivo. Measures of inflammatory prote-
omic signatures induced by a variety of immunological
stimulants aimed at different cell subsets may yield novel
biomarkers with functional relevance. An example of im-
plementation of such analyses in the clinical context is
the TruCulture® system, to assess immune cell activity.
This syringe-based device is designed to allow for the
sterile collection of whole blood and a variety of im-
munological stimulants aimed at different immune cell
subsets [127]. Supernatants, thereby enriched for se-
creted immunological mediators are quickly obtained
with limited manipulation and can be analyzed by multi-
plex platforms, either using electro-chemiluminescent
based immunoassays or bead-based immunoassay tech-
nology, readily available to most laboratories. In healthy
volunteers, this technique has been used to successfully
quantify production of immunological mediators and
was shown to differentiate specific proteomic profiles
for each of the stimulants used [128, 129] as well as dis-
tinguish immune responses to determined treatments
[130, 131]. Thus far, data are limited when it comes to
patients, but the technique has revealed a distinctive
pro-inflammatory signature characterized by altered
endothelial cell function and inflammation in schizo-
phrenia [132] and therefore may also be able to provide
important clues in circulating immunological parame-
ters in cancer patients.
T cell receptor diversity in anti-tumor response
T lymphocytes are key players in the anti-tumor re-
sponse induced by immunotherapies, and defining their
repertoire at baseline is a useful tool to determine gen-
eral immunocompetence and to quantify pre-existing
tumor-specific clones. The characterization of T cells
has long since focused on protein expression and func-
tional tests. TCR diversity allows for the recognition of a
variety of epitopes through TCR-MHC interaction and is
associated with the effective control of viral infections,
other pathogens [133–135], and tumor cells. TCR diver-
sity is generated by a complex mechanism mainly based
on genetic recombination of the DNA resulting in a tre-
mendous range of antigenic specificities. Historically the
analysis of TCR diversity has been set aside due to its
complexity and to the lack of relevant technologies to
accurately measure it. These past few years have seen a
growth of interest for the TCR diversity analysis as
technology gained precision and robustness. Following
Gnjatic et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2017) 5:44 
Page 8 of 18
 the approval of immunotherapies such as anti-CTLA-4
(ipilimumab) and anti-PD-1 (nivolumab and pembrolizu-
mab) in various tumor types, the need for a better under-
standing of the patient immune system has become even
more critical. Accumulating data on TCR diversity has
been generated, highlighting its key role in response
(clinical benefit and toxicity) to these immunotherapies.
TCR diversity has been estimated from 108 to up to
1015, which illustrates how challenging the assessment of
such a parameter can be. TCR diversity can be evaluated
by NGS, multi-N-plex qPCR, spectratyping and immune
phenotyping, each technology having its own depth of
analysis and robustness. The NGS approach provides the
CDR3 sequence of the TCR, from gDNA or RNA sam-
ples [136]. The multi-N-plex qPCR provides an exhaust-
ive
semi
quantitative
assessment
of
combinatorial
diversity (i.e., all V-J rearrangements). It uses genomic
DNA and a highly robust and reproducible PCR process,
which make it appropriate for routine clinical evaluation
of TCR diversity. Spectratyping was the first molecular
technology and is based on RNA PCR amplification of
V-C combinatorial diversity allowing the distinction of
10 to 13 CDR3 peaks per V gene. This technique is
mainly used for basic research. Other method can assess
TCR diversity at the protein level, with antibodies, but
they have lower resolution, as are limited to the V genes.
Several studies relate the impact of immunotherapies
on TCR diversity in peripheral blood. Indeed, it has been
shown that CTLA-4 blockade with tremelimumab diver-
sifies the peripheral T cell pool, underscoring the phar-
macodynamic effect of this class of immune-modulating
antibodies [137]. Cha et al. have demonstrated that
CTLA-4 blockade induces T cell repertoire evolution
and diversification. Moreover, improved clinical out-
comes were shown to be associated with less clonotype
loss, consistent with the maintenance of high-frequency
TCR clonotypes during treatment [124]. Postow et al.
have shown that baseline TCR diversity in the peripheral
blood was associated with clinical outcomes [138]. Few
results are available regarding the impact of anti-PD-1
on the diversity of TCR. A small study by Robert et al.
comparing repertoire evolution under anti-CTLA-4 and
anti-PD-1 treatment (9 anti-PD-1 patients; 21 anti-
CTLA-4 patients; 4 controls) shows that anti-PD-1 does
not
diversify
the
immune
repertoire
whereas
anti-
CTLA-4 does [139].
Prognostic/predictive value of serological markers and B
cells in cancer
B cells are commonly found at the tumor site of various
malignancies,
often
organized
in
germinal
centers,
resulting in the presence of plasma cells as well. Al-
though their function is still largely unknown, they sug-
gest an ongoing immune reaction at the tissue site. In
parallel, circulating autoantibodies with specificity to
tumor-derived antigens can often be detected in cancer
patients and help identify immunogenic targets in cancer
[32]. In general, whether tumor antigen-specific anti-
bodies are by-products of aberrant/ectopic expression or
whether they may have a functional role, such as helping
cross-present tumor-derived antigens to facilitate T cell
recognition [140], there is evidence that detection of IgG
specific to tumor associated targets like cancer-testis an-
tigens may act as a surrogate for the presence of T cells
[141]. Paradoxically, most of the tumor antigens targeted
by known autoantibodies are intracellular, making it
more challenging, though not impossible [142], that they
would convey a direct antitumor role. In the context of
checkpoint blockade, NY-ESO-1-specific autoantibodies
have been found to be associated with greater clinical
benefit in advanced melanoma patients treated with ipi-
limumab [143]. This raises the intriguing hypothesis that
tumor-specific antibodies may serve as an indicator of
the presence of tumor-specific T cells in the tumor
microenvironment, where patients with pre-existing cap-
acity to react to tumors may be favorably predisposed to
immunomodulatory treatment.
In support of this hypothesis, the presence of highly
organized B cell clusters forming germinal centers at the
tumor site, with areas including plasma cells surrounded
by T cells, and forming tertiary lymphoid structures
(TLS) [144], was shown to be highly predictive of out-
come in diverse solid tumors, such as NSCLC [145] and
melanoma [56]. In particular, the density of B cells as
well as mature dendritic cells (DC) correlated with that
of TLS in NSCLC, and together were the best predictors
of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival
(OS) in patients following surgical resection [146]. What
is the significance of these ectopic lymph node-like
structures? Their close proximity to the tumor tissue
suggests an active role in local immunogenicity, and
there is now evidence that infiltrating B cells as well as
T cells have tumor specificity. Following in vitro expan-
sion and differentiation into plasma cells, B cells isolated
from NSCLC tumors produce measurable IgG and IgA
antibody titers against known tumor associated antigens
such as NY-ESO-1, TP53, or XAGE-1 [145]. This further
supports the idea that B cells specific for tumor antigens
contribute to immune mechanisms present at baseline
and represent potential targets for immunotherapeutic
intervention.
Whether these immune responses develop first in clas-
sical secondary lymphoid organs to eventually reassem-
ble near the antigen source, or originate locally to
eventually become systemically detected is yet to be de-
termined. Mice devoid of lymph nodes can still mount
an immune response thanks to ad hoc TLS structures in
tissues, which suggests the potential for direct priming
Gnjatic et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2017) 5:44 
Page 9 of 18
 locally [147]. Linking the presence of these local anti-
body responses to systemic humoral immunity will also
be key in establishing serology as a prognostic or pre-
dictive marker of disease outcome.
Circulating MDSC and suppressive cells
Besides adaptive immune responses (T and B cells), sup-
pressive immune subsets have been proposed as key fac-
tors explaining why cancer progresses despite baseline
immunity, and why they may be the best targets for
immunomodulation. Increased frequency of MDSC in
the blood of cancer patients may be an indication of
tumor progression, commonly dependent on the tumor
stage, at least for some solid and hematologic malignan-
cies. As a consequence of the impact of therapy on
tumor mass, MDSC levels can also decrease after treat-
ment and inversely correlate with response to chemo-
therapy or surgery [37, 148]. However, some data
indicate that the frequency of circulating MDSC can be
associated
with
patient
prognosis
independently
of
tumor burden [149, 150]. Interestingly, an algorithm for
prediction of therapeutic responses to immune check-
point inhibitors based on MDSC blood frequency was
developed and is being tested in clinical trials [150].
Characterization of MDSC is commonly performed by
flow cytometry. Different subsets of human MDSC have
been described using a combination of myeloid markers,
and define three main categories of MDSC. Immature
MDSC are positive for the common myeloid marker
CD33, but lack the expression of HLA-DR as well as
lineage-specific markers of differentiated leukocytes
(lin− cocktail usually contains antibodies specific to CD3,
CD14, CD16, CD19, CD20, and CD56). More differenti-
ated MDSC are divided into subsets including poly-
morphonuclear
(PMN)-MDSC
(CD11b+/CD14−/CD15
+/HLA-DR−)
and
monocytic-MDSC
(CD11b+/CD14
+/IL4Rα+/CD15−/HLA-DR−) [37, 148]. In most studies a
single defined MDSC subset is analyzed, which is a major
limitation considering the lack of univocal data about
phenotypes and the heterogeneity of human tumors.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of studies provide
experimental evidence that the analyzed myeloid cells in-
deed exert an immunosuppressive activity on activated T
cells, the main characteristic of MDSC [151]. The first
comprehensive immune monitoring of human MDSC
employed a nine-color analysis of six subsets of myeloid
cells in a randomized, phase II clinical trial in renal cancer
patients vaccinated with a multi-epitope mixture of shared
cancer antigens [152]. In this study, five out of the six
MDSC subsets were significantly expanded in the blood of
the 68 monitored renal cancer patients compared to
healthy donors. Moreover, the level of two of the MDSC
subsets, prior to vaccination, significantly negatively corre-
lated with overall patient survival [152].
A few studies have provided the initial indication that
levels of MDSC inversely correlate with OS in metastatic
melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab [150, 153]
and that a decrease in MDSC after neoadjuvant ipilimu-
mab treatment of patients with melanoma correlates
with improved PFS [154]. In view of the immune-
mediated mechanisms of action by ipilimumab, lower
levels of suppressive cells could represent not only an
estimator of the clinical benefit but also a pharmacody-
namic biomarker, reflecting the shift from immune es-
cape to immune response. To date, however, there is no
evidence to indicate whether ipilimumab targets MDSC
directly or, conversely, whether the lower MDSC levels
observed following ipilimumab treatment are an indirect
outcome of tumor shrinkage in response to immune-
mediated rejection. In the future, it will be important to
evaluate MDSC as potential biomarkers in patients
treated with other immune checkpoint inhibitors (i.e.,
anti-PD-1/PD-L1) or agonistic antibodies (i.e., anti-CD40).
Given the discrepancies in the field, a proficiency
panel for human MDSC was established under the um-
brella of the Association for Cancer Immunotherapy
immunomonitoring group. In this panel, ten different
subsets of MDSC were evaluated simultaneously by 23
experienced laboratories in Europe and the USA, repre-
senting the largest MDSC analysis undertaken so far.
Analysis of the first phase from this panel is now avail-
able, demonstrating variability in MDSC determination,
and calling for the harmonization of this field [155].
Moreover, the panel has made recommendations to
standardize handling of samples, as subsets such as
PMN-MDSC are particularly susceptible to damage from
freeze-thawing protocols.
Predictive biomarkers for adjuvant therapy
Immunotherapies that have shown evidence of antitu-
mor effects in the setting of advanced inoperable disease
are now moving to the adjuvant setting, i.e., adminis-
tered in patients with earlier stages following surgical
treatment to reduce the risk of relapse and/or mortality.
While we focused so far on baseline biomarkers prior to
therapy, surgical tumor resection may be seen as a “re-
set” of the baseline that warrants the exploration of
immune-based biomarkers in patients without evidence
of tumor but likely to recur. The prognostic assessment
of risk for relapse/mortality is therefore central to the
pursuit of adjuvant postoperative therapy, since the can-
didate for adjuvant therapy must have an elevated risk of
recurrence. This relapse risk arises from micrometastatic
(clinically undetectable) disease, beyond the scope of the
locoregional surgical (or other, e.g., radiotherapy) treat-
ment. The fundamental tenet of adjuvant therapy is thus,
that treatment in the adjuvant setting has a therapeutic
benefit that exceeds the benefit of later treatment at
Gnjatic et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2017) 5:44 
Page 10 of 18
 recurrence, with metastatic disease that is potentially in-
operable. Toward this end, biomarkers have been evalu-
ated to ’ refine our assessment of relapse risk and
mortality risk and (2) predict the likelihood of benefit
(or conversely, toxicity) from therapy.
Melanoma was the first solid tumor for which im-
munotherapy was successfully pursued, beginning with
recombinant IFNα-2a and IFNα-2b in the early 1980s.
More than 22 phase III studies have now been com-
pleted that show a consistent reduction in relapse risk
and improvement in OS with IFNα-2a/b in individual
trials, as well as several meta-analyses [156–159]. Unfor-
tunately, only a small subset of these postoperative trials
were accompanied by corollary studies designed to iden-
tify the mechanism of action for this, and more recently
examined candidate adjuvant therapy agents. Broadly
useful prognostic and predictive biomarkers were not
identified in the gamut of the postoperative phase III tri-
als reported to date. Studies of the peripheral blood ob-
tained at multiple time points during one of the largest
of these US Intergroup trials E1694 [160] showed that
baseline blood pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemo-
kine levels determined by bead immunoassay correlated
with
relapse-free
survival
among
patients
receiving
IFNα-2b, but not an inactive (GM2 vaccine) control.
Evaluation of the phenotype of blood lymphocytes has
not yielded consistent or useful data, and prospective
clinical/serological studies have shown a correlation of
the development of autoimmunity with therapeutic
benefit in terms of both relapse-free and OS, in the
He13A/98 Hellenic Oncology Group trial [161]. The first
promising biomarker of antitumor benefit in an adjuvant
trial was the clinical and serological evidence of auto-
immunity, which correlated with improved PFS and OS
(p < 0.01), and was predominantly manifest in auto-
immune
hyperthyroidism
or
hypothyroidism
[161].
Retrospective serological studies that differed in omitting
the clinical assessment of autoimmunity have shown
conflicting results [162]. However, the development of
clinical and/or serological manifestations of autoimmun-
ity during therapy is a biomarker that cannot be utilized
to select patients pre-treatment. Baseline pre-treatment
studies of S100 protein levels in the blood (>0.15ug/L)
have demonstrated modest prognostic utility, but have
had limited application due to variable availability, and
the marginal added value [163]. The E4697 Intergroup
phase III trial of GM-CSF (Sargramostim, Sanofi) has
shown no significant benefit of adjuvant therapy with
GM-CSF, alone or combined with a triple lineage anti-
gen peptide vaccine for patients with resectable stage
III/IV disease; it also showed no prognostic or predictive
utility for the assessment of immunological response to
the peptide vaccine by ELISpot [164]. The EORTC
18071 phase III adjuvant trial of high-dose ipilimumab
for stage III resected melanoma (10 mg/kg given for
3 years) reported improvement in relapse-free and OS,
without corollary immunological or other assessments
reported to date [165].
The exploration of the multitude of new immuno-
oncology agent combinations for adjuvant therapy of
melanoma and other solid tumors demands more effi-
cient approaches than were previously required when
therapeutic options were limited. The embarrassment of
riches in the advent of >10 new agents for treatment of
metastatic melanoma poses issues for the development
of
combined modality
adjuvant
therapy
that
high-
throughput bioinformatics, multiplex IHC, and NGS are
uniquely able to address.
Host related biomarkers
After focusing on peripheral and tissue biomarkers, it is
important to consider host-related factors that could
have a role in general immunocompetence and immuno-
therapy outcomes, not unlike what is observed for tumor
susceptibility in mice of different strains.
Single nucleotide polymorphisms
SNP represent normal variations in single nucleotides
throughout the genome. Some SNP (nonsynonymous)
will impact the amino acid sequence of an encoded pro-
tein and are responsible for the variations observed in
protein sequences. SNP have been linked to the develop-
ment of different diseases, variable response to drugs,
differing toxicities induced by drugs, and the ability to
respond to infections. There are an estimated ten million
SNP in the human genome found in both coding and
non-coding regions. The most common method used to
analyze SNP is via commercial SNP array platforms.
Most platforms can evaluate up to one million SNP per
individual with an accuracy of 99%. Linkage disequilib-
rium, which is the nonrandom combination of SNP in
certain chromosomes, allows commercial platforms to
detect 80% of common SNP [166].
GWAS are needed to determine the functional signifi-
cance of SNP. GWAS attempt to find the variations that
are of importance by identifying those that are statisti-
cally more prevalent in individuals with one condition
compared to individuals without that condition. A chal-
lenge in GWAS studies is the large numbers of cases
and controls needed for statistical power to obtain ex-
tremely low p-values. The ability to identify hundreds of
thousands of variants causes a multiple testing burden
resulting in a high false positive association rate. To have
some confidence in the association of a SNP and a par-
ticular disease or condition, the p-value threshold for
significance must be very stringent, i.e., 10−6 or lower.
There is significant evidence that SNP play a major
role in modulating both levels of immunity and the
Gnjatic et al. Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer  (2017) 5:44 
Page 11 of 18
 immune response to different stimuli. Studies have been
performed evaluating the phenotype of multiple immune
cell subsets and analyzing their variability across a popu-
lation in association with detected genomic variants
[167]. Investigators identified several provocative corre-
lations. A SNP in ENTPD1 which encodes CD39
accounted for 61% of the phenotypic variation in the
levels of CD39+ CD4+ Treg. A variant identified near
IL2RA, a gene encoding the transmembrane portion of
CD25, was associated with differing levels of T cells
highly expressing CD25. Similarly, a variant near the
genes for CD8A and CD8B was associated with diversity
in the levels of T cells expressing CD8. More recent
studies have suggested that SNP are critical in CD4+ T
cell development and activation especially for Treg
and Th17 cells [168]. These data underscore the role
of SNP in governing the level and activation state of
immune cells.
Genetic variants have been extensively studied as a
cause for the diversity seen in the ability to generate an
immune response after vaccination or even the level of
immunity achieved after vaccination. Two frequent ex-
amples are variations in MHC genes as well as genes en-
coding cytokines or associated with cytokine secretion.
Investigators have demonstrated that SNP occurring
within MHC class I and II genes were correlated with
response to childhood vaccinations [169]. Specific SNP
in MHC genes were not only associated with serum
levels of immunoglobulins and isotypes but also with the
variations observed in vaccine-specific antibody re-
sponses generated with immunization. A recent meta-
analysis evaluated 13 GWAS including over 11,000 indi-
viduals who were immunized with common vaccines.
Seven SNP in HLA genes were included in the analysis
and significant associations were found for SNP that
were linked with significant decreases in antibody re-
sponses
(DRB1*07,
DQA1*02:01,
DQB1*02:01,
and
DQB1*03:03) and SNP that were associated with a sig-
nificant increase in antibody response with vaccination
(DRB1*13 and DRB1*13:01). Studies of measles and ru-
bella vaccines suggest that SNP linked with secreted IL-
6 and IFNγ may dictate variations in the levels of the
vaccinated immune response observed between individ-
uals [170, 171]. The studies described above demonstrate
just a few examples of immune associated SNP, although
many more have been identified. For example, responses
to vaccines or monoclonal antibody therapy have been
related to SNP in Fc receptor genes or genes associated
with innate immune cells [172, 173]. Additionally, spe-
cific SNP in toll-like receptor genes have been associated
with disease [174].
Most immuno-oncology trials have not focused on an
evaluation of SNP as a cause of clinical response diver-
sity, lack of response, or variations in immunity. There
are sufficient data in the literature to begin to validate
the most well studied immune related SNP as a cause of
response diversity.
Conclusions
Tumor cells do not grow and survive in isolation but ra-
ther interact with intratumoral immune cells. Conse-
quently, this immune interaction with the underlying
tumor immunome and the TME determines tumor sur-
vival [76, 98]. The recent success of immunotherapies
targeting the immune checkpoint molecules, CTLA-4,
PD-1, and PD-L1 for the treatment of cancer has em-
phasized the essential role of the immune system for
eradicating tumors. While these immunotherapies have
had stunning results, the percentage of patients with
clinical benefit is limited and the reason behind this is
not well understood. The ability to predict whether a pa-
tient will respond or become resistant to immunother-
apy is essential to finding a cure for cancer.
Pairing clinical response data with an interrogation of
the TME and circulating immune indicators that can
serve as a window into the TME will be critically im-
portant to identify relevant biomarkers.
One of the key factors that may contribute to a better
understanding of the impact of immunotherapies on the
patient adaptive immune system appears to be TCR di-
versity. Additional clinical assessment and validation
(both retrospectively and prospectively) are ongoing to
confirm the relevance of TCR diversity (in blood or at
tumor site), alone or in combination with other immune
parameters, to predict response to cancer immunother-
apy. Diligent sample (blood/PBMC/tumor/lymph node)
and data (including clinical response according to im-
mune related Response Criteria) [175] collection in on-
going and future cancer immunotherapy clinical trials
will be critical to achieve this goal. Alternatively, meas-
urement of tumor-infiltrating B cell responses may
present some advantages as the mark of “local immuno-
competence” because measurement of antibodies can be
performed in high-throughput with greater ease com-
pared to T cell specificity assays. There is a clear need in
the future to use multiplex IHC to characterize the TME
beyond just T cells to include B cells and markers for
TLS as well. While TCR sequencing has led to useful in-
formation about clonality and diversity of the repertoire,
it would also be of interest to quantify the changes in B
cell repertoire at the tumor site in light of their presence
and prognostic role in tissues. Eventually, a need to de-
velop predictive methods to link B cell receptor se-
quences with specificity to antigens would provide the
greatest leap forward.
A powerful approach to integrate the value seen in
studies of both T and B cells in the setting of malignant
solid tumors is gene-based immune diagnostics. Perhaps

 the greatest challenge facing the development of gene-
based immune diagnostics is the lack of data comparing
the prognostic and predictive qualities of immune genes
and gene signatures to that of gold standard IHC-based
methods for quantifying immune cell abundance and
functional orientation. From a logical perspective, the
greatest potential for immune gene signatures may be
found in the prediction of responsiveness to current and
emerging immune therapies. In this context, patient co-
horts randomized to treatment with sufficiently large n
and longitudinal endpoints encompassing both tumor
response and patient survival will be essential for com-
prehensive assessment of clinical utility. Furthermore, to
enable rigorous comparisons, standardized protocols for
the histopathological assessment of TIL and effector cell
populations will need to be developed and uniformly im-
plemented, as discussed [49, 176, 177]. Finally, emerging
evidence from breast cancer studies indicating that im-
mune gene classifiers of outcome exhibit significant as-
sociations in some cancer subtypes, but not others,
suggest that heterogeneity related to tumor immunogen-
icity, mechanisms of immune tolerance, or other factors
that
influence
immune
function
may
need
to
be
accounted for to determine the applicability of immune
diagnostics for individual patients.
Toward the goal of defining the role of local innate
immune cells in the TME, an international proficiency
panel for human MDSC has made strides toward assay
harmonization in order to address discrepancies in the
field. This panel also agreed upon recommendations for
standardization of sample handling. However, MDSC
characterization as biomarkers might benefit further
from
a
number
of
additional
analyses.
Molecular
markers associated with effector inhibitory mechanisms
(ARG1, NOS2, IDO1, IDO2, NOX2, PD-L1, PD-L2, IL-
10) could, at least in theory, avoid the cumbersome and
difficult to standardize functional studies. In addition,
comparison between circulating and tumor-associated
myeloid cells in each single patient, both before and
after immunotherapy, might help to address the issue of
the
cross-talk
between
local
and
distant
tumor-
conditioned environments and rank the usefulness of
the relative biomarkers.
The prediction of therapeutic benefit from immuno-
therapies presumes knowledge of the mechanism of ac-
tion that has often not been available. The advent of
new technologies has made possible a more comprehen-
sive analysis of the immune system in the TME, which
will yield valuable mechanistic data that can be trans-
lated into clinically relevant biomarkers. A depth of un-
derstanding of the relationship between pre-existing
immunity and the TME is now more important than ever,
as approvals for new combination and adjuvant therapies
add a layer of complexity to this dynamic puzzle.
In conclusion, experts from Working Group 4 of
SITC’s Immune Biomarkers Task Force have explored in
this manuscript several facets of what contributes to
baseline immunity against tumors and that may predict
clinical outcome in cancer patients. In contrast to other
Task Force initiatives, the recommendations made here
are more exploratory, as this is a nascent but rapidly
evolving topic. Continuing discoveries in host genetic
factors (SNP), tumor alterations in genes and proteins
affecting the antigen presentation machinery [178, 179],
or the local recruitment of immune actors [180, 181] all
contribute to our understanding of how the TME be-
comes organized and affects peripheral immune detec-
tion in the circulation. While immunocompetence is still
difficult to define as a biomarker, it is likely that a com-
bination of personalized measurements will be required
for an accurate correlative predictive signature in each
patient.
