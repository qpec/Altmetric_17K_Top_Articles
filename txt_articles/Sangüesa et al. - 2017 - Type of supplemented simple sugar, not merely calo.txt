Abstract 
24 
High consumption of simple sugars causes adverse cardio-metabolic effects. We 
25 
investigated the mechanisms underlying the metabolic and vascular effects of glucose or 
26 
fructose intake and determined whether these effects are exclusively related to increased 
27 
calorie consumption. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were supplemented with 20% w/v 
28 
glucose or fructose for 2 months, and plasma analytes and aortic response to vasodilator 
29 
and vasoconstrictor agents were determined. Expression of molecules associated with 
30 
lipid metabolism, insulin signalling and vascular response were evaluated in hepatic 
31 
and/or aortic tissues.  Caloric intake was increased in both sugar-supplemented groups 
32 
vs control, and in glucose- vs fructose-supplemented rats. Hepatic lipogenesis was 
33 
induced in both groups. Plasma triglycerides were increased only in the fructose group, 
34 
together with decreased expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A and increased 
35 
microsomal triglyceride transfer protein expression in the liver. Plasma adiponectin and 
36 
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)α expression were increased only by 
37 
glucose supplementation. Insulin signalling in liver and aorta were impaired in both 
38 
sugar-supplemented groups, but the effect was more pronounced in the fructose group. 
39 
Fructose supplementation attenuated aortic relaxation response to a nitric oxide (NO) 
40 
donor, whereas glucose potentiated it. Phenylephrine-induced maximal contractions 
41 
were reduced in the glucose group, which could be related to increased endothelial NO 
42 
synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation and subsequent elevated basal NO in the glucose 
43 
group. In conclusion, despite higher caloric intake in glucose-supplemented rats, 
44 
fructose caused worse metabolic and vascular responses. This may be due to the 
45 
elevated adiponectin level and the subsequent enhancement of PPARα and eNOS 
46 
phosphorylation in glucose-supplemented rats. 
47

NEW & NOTEWORTHY 
49 
This is the first study comparing the effects of glucose and fructose consumption on 
50 
metabolic factors and aortic function in female rats. Our results show that although total 
51 
caloric consumption was higher in glucose-supplemented rats, fructose ingestion had a 
52 
greater impact in inducing metabolic and aortic dysfunction.

Insulin resistance, obesity and type 2 diabetes are metabolic disturbances leading 
57 
to cardiovascular diseases (CVD). CVD are main causes of morbidity and mortality in 
58 
diabetes, and both micro- and macro-vascular complications are thought to play a major 
59 
role in the development of CVD in pre-diabetic and diabetic patients (14, 30). 
 
60 
 
 
In humans, an excessive intake of added sugars has been linked to the 
61 
development of metabolic disturbances (22, 39), and therefore to an increase in the risk 
62 
for CVD mortality (59). Despite the evidence generated from epidemiological studies, 
63 
the molecular mechanisms linking diabetes and CVD in the population with excessive 
64 
sugar intake are not fully understood. At the vascular level, insulin resistance (32, 34) 
65 
along with dyslipidaemia, local inflammation and a decrease in the synthesis of 
66 
endothelium derived relaxation factors such as nitric oxide (NO) may play a key role in 
67 
the development of CVD (25). 
68 
 
The adverse cardio-metabolic effects of simple sugars seem to be worse when 
69 
they are ingested in liquid than in solid form, because the level of food intake is not 
70 
reduced enough to compensate the extra calories provided by beverages (53), leading to 
71 
an increase in total caloric intake. Consumption of simple sugars in liquid form 
72 
essentially occurs as sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB), which include sodas, colas, fruit 
73 
punches, lemonade, and other fruit drinks with added sugars. The main compounds used 
74 
by the food industry to sweeten these beverages are high fructose corn syrup (in USA) 
75 
and sucrose (in Europe), both containing approximately equal amounts of fructose and 
76 
glucose (48). At present, there is an intense debate in the scientific community about 
77 
whether the adverse cardiovascular and metabolic effects of SSB are mostly attributable 
78 
to specific effects of the simple sugars used as sweeteners, or are merely the 
79 
consequence of the increase in caloric intake and weight gain in the population 
80 
consuming large quantities of SSB (10, 26, 49, 52).  
81 
 
 
To study the effects of simple sugar consumption in liquid form on glucose and 
82 
lipid metabolism, the rat is a good model which has been extensively used by us (7, 41–
83 
43, 54–56). In previous studies, we showed that female rats supplemented for short 
84 
periods of time (14 days) with liquid fructose displayed a more detrimental response 
85 
than male rats. Specifically, we reported that fructose induced hypertriglyceridemia and 
86 
fatty liver in both sexes but only females showed glucose intolerance and hepatic insulin 
87 
resistance (41, 56). Insulin resistance is a prominent feature of metabolic diseases such 
88 
as obesity or type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is also a major risk factor for CVD. A 
89 
relationship between insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction has been proposed 
90 
  
4
as a link between cardiovascular and metabolic diseases (27).  Endothelial dysfunction 
91 
is defined as a reduced endothelium-dependent vasodilation (EDV) to vasodilators, such 
92 
as acetylcholine (ACh) and bradykinin (BK), or flow-mediated vasodilation. Thus, EDV 
93 
is generally used as a reproducible parameter to investigate endothelial function under 
94 
various pathological conditions such as diabetes, obesity and dyslipidaemia. While past 
95 
studies were performed largely on males, there is increasing awareness by the NIH that 
96 
research should include females. Here, we sought to study the effects of 2-month 
97 
supplementation with liquid fructose or glucose (20% w/v), on the metabolic response 
98 
and vascular reactivity in aorta, a large conduit artery, in female rats. To measure the 
99 
vascular function, EDV was assessed by examining the aortic relaxation responses to 
100 
ACh and BK (receptor-mediated NO-dependent vasodilators). Aortic response to a NO 
101 
donor was also determined by measuring the relaxation responses to sodium 
102 
nitroprusside (SNP). Furthermore, vasoconstrictor responses to phenylephrine (PE) 
103 
were studied. Our aims were to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the 
104 
metabolic and vascular effects of these simple sugars and to determine whether these 
105 
effects are exclusively related to increased calorie consumption.   
106 
 
107 
Materials and methods 
108 
Animals and experimental design 
109 
Female Sprague-Dawley rats, aged 9–11 weeks (Simonsen Laboratories, Gilroy, 
110 
CA, USA) were maintained with water and standard rodent chow food ad libitum at 
111 
constant humidity and temperature, with a light/dark cycle of 12 h. After acclimation for 
112 
1 week, the animals were randomly assigned to a control group, a glucose-
113 
supplemented and a fructose-supplemented group (14 rats per group). Sugars were 
114 
supplied as a 20 % (w/v) solution in drinking water for 8 weeks. Body weight, food and 
115 
drink intake were monitored throughout the experiment. After 8 weeks, the rats were 
116 
fasted for 12 h and euthanized using CO2 according to the recommendations from the 
117 
2013 AVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia (28) and the NIH Guidelines for the Care and 
118 
Use of Laboratory Animals: Eighth Edition (US National Institutes of Health 2011). All 
119 
animal protocols were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of the 
120 
Pacific and complied with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals: 
121 
Eighth Edition (US National Institutes of Health 2011) and with ARRIVE guidelines. 
122 
The 8-week duration of sugar supplementation was chosen in order to mimic a sub-
123 
  
5
chronic regime, as this period of ingestion in rats is roughly equivalent to 6 years of 
124 
consumption in humans (45). 
125 
Blood analysis  
126 
Glucose, triglycerides and cholesterol were measured in 12 h fasted rats using an 
127 
Accutrend® Plus System glucometer and specific test strips (Roche Farma, Barcelona, 
128 
Spain) with blood collected from the tail vein. Blood samples were obtained by intra-
129 
cardiac puncture and collected in tubes containing anticoagulant. Plasma was obtained 
130 
by centrifugation at 10,000xg for 5 min at 4°C and stored at −80 °C until used. Leptin 
131 
(Invitrogen, Camarillo, CA, USA), adiponectin (Adipogen, Liestal, Switzerland) and 
132 
insulin (Spi Bio, Montigny Le Bretonneux France) levels were determined in plasma 
133 
samples by ELISA kits according to the manufacturer’s protocol.  
134 
Measurement of arterial tension 
135 
The thoracic aortae were isolated and cleaned of fatty and adhering connective 
136 
tissues and then cut into 2 mm rings, exactly. To measure isometric tension, the rings 
137 
were suspended horizontally between two stainless steel hooks in individual organ baths 
138 
containing 20 ml of Krebs buffer (in mM: 119 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.18 KH2PO4, 1.17 
139 
MgSO4, 24.9 NaHCO3, 0.023 EDTA, 1.6 CaCl2, and 6.0 glucose) at 37°C bubbled with 
140 
95% O2 and 5% CO2 (40). Isometric tension was continuously monitored with a 
141 
computer based data acquisition system (PowerLab, ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, 
142 
USA). The rings were equilibrated for 40 min under a resting tension of 1 g to allow 
143 
development of a stable basal tone. Stimulation of rings with 80 mM KCl was repeated 
144 
two times every 20 min until maximum contraction was achieved. The ability of ACh 
145 
(10 μM) to induce relaxation of phenylephrine (PE, 2 μM) pre-contracted vessels was 
146 
taken as an evidence for the preservation of the intact endothelium.  
147 
Relaxation responses to ACh 
148 
Aortic rings were contracted with PE (2 μM), a concentration that produced 80% 
149 
of the maximal effect (EC80). Dilator response curves were obtained by the addition of 
150 
increasing concentrations of ACh (10−8 to 10−5 M).  
151 
Relaxation responses to BK 
152 
The concentration response curves to BK, were measured following the addition 
153 
of increasing concentrations of BK (10−9 to 10−5 M) in U46619 (100 nM) pre-contracted 
154 
aortic rings taken from all groups. 
155 
Relaxation responses to SNP 
156 
  
6
Responses to SNP (10−9 to 10−5 M), a NO-donor, were generated in the aortic 
157 
rings pre-contracted with PE (2 μM) from all groups. 
158 
Contractile responses to PE 
159 
The constrictor concentration response curves to PE (10−8 to 10−5 M) were 
160 
generated before and after incubation with Nω-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 
161 
200 μM), a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, in the presence of indomethacin 
162 
(indo, 10 μM, dissolved in DMSO), a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor. Between each 
163 
concentration response curve, tissues were washed with Krebs buffer to allow the rings 
164 
to return to the basal tone. The use of this concentration of L-NAME was based on 
165 
previous studies (18, 19). A vehicle only (no drugs present) study was performed 
166 
simultaneously in aortic rings from the same animal.  
167 
Measurement of Nitrate and Nitrite in endothelial cells 
168 
The permanently established EA.hy926 endothelial cell line (passage 5-6) 
169 
(American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA, USA) were plated and 
170 
cultured in low glucose (1000mg/l) Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium supplemented 
171 
with 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Scientific) and antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin 
172 
and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C with 95% air and 5% CO2.  Upon reaching 80% 
173 
confluence, cells were treated with Recombinant Human gAcrp30/Adipolean (Globular 
174 
adiponectin, 5 and 15 μg/ml, Peprotech Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ, USA), glucose or fructose 
175 
(25 mM, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The NO donor S-Nitroso-N-Acetyl-
176 
D,L-Penicillamine (SNAP, 100 µM, Tocris  Biosciences, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was 
177 
used as a positive control, and mannitol (25 mM, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) 
178 
as an osmotic control.  After  30 min, cell culture supernatants were collected and  NO 
179 
levels were determined by measurement of the end products of its metabolism NOx 
180 
[nitrate (NO3
-) plus nitrite (NO2
-)] using the Nitrate/Nitrite Colorimetric Assay Kit 
181 
(Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) according to manufacturer’s suggestions. 
182 
Five to six different samples for each condition were performed in duplicate. 
183 
RNA isolation and Real-Time PCR 
184 
Samples of liver, visceral white adipose and aortic tissues were weighed, 
185 
immediately frozen in dry ice and stored at −80 °C until used for RNA extraction. Total 
186 
RNA was isolated from liver and adipose tissue samples by using TrizolR reagent 
187 
(Invitrogen™, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and from aortic samples using RNeasy mini kit 
188 
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. 
189 
cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using the Omniscript reverse 
190 
  
7
transcriptase kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Samples were incubated at 37°C for 60 
191 
min in MJ Mini™ Personal Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad, Hércules, CA, USA). The PCR 
192 
reaction was carried out in StepOnePlus™ Real-Time PCR System Thermal Cycling 
193 
Block (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using SYBR® Green PCR Master 
194 
Mix (Applied Biosystems), 100 nM of each specific primer and 10 - 50 ng of cDNA for 
195 
each gene. PCR reactions were performed in duplicate and normalized to a 
196 
housekeeping gene using the 2−ΔΔCt method. The TATA box binding protein (tbp) was 
197 
used as a control for liver and β-actin (actb) was used for adipose tissue and aorta. 
198 
Primer sequences and PCR product length are listed in Table 1. 
199 
 
Preparation of total protein and nuclear extracts 
200 
Aortic and visceral adipose tissue samples were micronized through freezing 
201 
with liquid nitrogen and grinding with a mortar as previously described (7). Liver 
202 
samples were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. For total protein extraction, 
203 
lysis buffer with proteases, phosphatases and acetylases inhibitors (in mM: 50 Tris–HCl 
204 
pH=8, 150 NaCl, 10 NaF, 1 EDTA, 1 EGTA, 2 Nappi, 1 PMSF, 1 Na3VO4, 10 NaM, 
205 
0.001 TSA) plus 1% Igepal, 2 µg/mL leupeptin and 2 µg/mL aprotinin was used. 
206 
Samples were incubated with this buffer for 1.5 h at 4°C, centrifuged at 15,000×g for 15 
207 
min at 4°C and supernatants were collected. To obtain hepatic nuclear extracts for the 
208 
determination of the transcription factors PPARα, ChREBP and SREBP-1C, 
209 
homogenization buffer (in mM: 10 Tris–HCl pH=8, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 KCl, 2 Nappi, 10 
210 
NaF, 0.5 DTT, 1 PMSF, 1 Na3VO4, 10 NaM, 10-6 TSA) plus 2 µg/mL leupeptin and 2 
211 
µg/mL aprotinin was used. The homogenates were kept on ice for 10 min and 
212 
centrifuged at 1000xg for 10 min at 4°C. Lysis buffer was added to the pellet obtained 
213 
and samples were incubated for 1.5 h at 4°C, centrifuged at 25,000×g for 30 min at 4°C 
214 
and supernatants were collected. Protein concentrations were determined by the 
215 
Bradford method (9). 
216 
Western blot analysis  
217 
20-30 µg of protein was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 
218 
Proteins were then transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride transfer 
219 
membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 
220 
5% non-fat milk solution in 0.1% Tween-20-Tris-buffered saline (TBS), and incubated 
221 
overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies. Primary antibodies for p-ACC (Ser79), total 
222 
ACC, p-Akt (Ser473), total Akt, p-eNOS (Ser1177), iNOS, PKG-1 (recognizing both α 
223 
and βisoforms) p-VASP (Ser157), p-VASP (Ser239) and total VASP were supplied by 
224 
  
8
Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA, USA). Antibodies against IRS-1, IRS-2, ChREBP, 
225 
SREBP-1c, MTP and FAS were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Dallas, TX, 
226 
USA). PPARα, PDE4 and SCD1 antibodies were obtained from AbCam (Cambridge, 
227 
UK). Antibody against rat liver CPT-1A was kindly provided by L. Herrero and D. 
228 
Serra (Department of Biochemistry and Physiology, School of Pharmacy, University of 
229 
Barcelona) (21, 37). Detection was performed using the Pierce® ECL Western Blotting 
230 
Substrate (Thermo Scientific) and Immobilion™ Western Chemiluminescent HRP 
231 
Substrate (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). To confirm the uniformity of protein 
232 
loading, blots were incubated with β-actin or β-tubulin antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich, St. 
233 
Louis, MO, USA) as a control.  
234 
Data presentation and statistical analysis 
235 
Results are expressed as the mean of n values ± SEM, where n represents data 
236 
from one rat. Relaxation responses to ACh, BK, and SNP were calculated as the 
237 
percentage of relaxation from maximum PE or U46619 contraction. Similarly, the 
238 
recorded increase in the force of contraction was calculated as the percentage of 
239 
maximum contraction obtained with PE at the highest dose. EC50, the concentration of 
240 
the agonist which produces half of the maximum effect (Emax), was calculated by a 
241 
sigmoidal dose-response model (for variable slope) using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad 
242 
Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The sensitivity of the agonists was expressed as 
243 
pD2 values (-log [EC50]). In general, statistical analyses were performed by one-way 
244 
ANOVA test, after gaussian distribution of the data was verified by the Kolmogorov-
245 
Smirnov normality test and equality of variance by Bartlett's test.  When the ANOVA 
246 
test returned P<0.05, post-hoc analysis using Bonferroni’s test was performed. 
247 
Comparison of concentration response curves between groups was done using two-way 
248 
ANOVA, with one factor being concentration and the other being groups. To compare 
249 
the effect of L-NAME on the PE response, the PE results were expressed as differences 
250 
of area under the concentration response curve (ΔAUC) in control (absence of L-
251 
NAME) and experimental (presence of L-NAME) condition. The level of statistical 
252 
significance was set at P<0.05.

Results  
255 
 
 
Only fructose supplementation causes hypertriglyceridemia and increases 
256 
body and liver weight 
257

As it is shown in Table 2, rats supplemented with 20% glucose or fructose 
258 
increased their liquid consumption (by 2-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively). Further, they 
259 
partially compensated the increase in caloric intake by reducing the consumption of 
260 
solid food (by 0.3-fold in glucose group and by 0.5-fold in fructose group). As a result, 
261 
the total amount of ingested calories was increased in both groups. However, total 
262 
caloric intake in glucose-supplemented rats was significantly higher than that of 
263 
fructose-supplemented rats (1.15-fold). Despite this difference, only the fructose group 
264 
exhibited a significant increase in final body weight (by 1.1-fold). Due to the increase in 
265 
body weight, organ weights were normalized to femur length, which was not altered by 
266 
sugar supplementation. Liver weight was increased only by fructose supplementation 
267 
(by 1.4-fold vs control, and 1.3-fold vs glucose-fed rats), whereas adipose tissue weight 
268 
was significantly increased in both sugar-supplemented groups (by 5.6-fold in the 
269 
glucose group and 5.2-fold in the fructose group). Consistent with the increase in 
270 
adiposity, plasma leptin levels and adipose tissue leptin mRNA expression were also 
271 
elevated in both experimental groups (Table 2).    
272 
 
 
Blood lipid analysis revealed that the cholesterol concentration was not modified 
273 
in either glucose- or fructose-supplemented rats (Table 2). However, the levels of 
274 
triglycerides were significantly increased in blood taken from fructose-supplemented 
275 
rats (by 1.2-fold, Table 2).     
 
 
276 
 
 
Both sugars induce hepatic lipogenesis but only fructose increases 
277 
microsomal triglyceride transfer protein expression 
278 
 
 
The hypertriglyceridemia and increased liver weight observed in fructose-
279 
supplemented rats prompted us to examine the mRNA/protein expression of 
280 
lipogenesis-related enzymes. The mRNA expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 
281 
(scd1) was increased by glucose (3.4-fold) and fructose (4.2-fold) (Figure 1A). 
282 
Accordingly, SCD1 protein levels were increased after glucose and fructose 
283 
supplementation (by 1.4 and 1.7-fold, respectively), but the increase in the glucose 
284 
group did not reach statistical significance (Figure 1B). Although the mRNA expression 
285 
of fatty acid synthase (fas) showed a non-significant tendency to increase in both groups 
286 
(Figure 1C), FAS protein levels were significantly increased by 2-fold in glucose-
287 
supplemented and by 2.4-fold in the fructose-supplemented group (Figure 1D). The 
288 
amount of total and phosphorylated acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) was significantly 
289 
increased in the liver by both sugars (Figure 1E, F), suggesting that the degree of ACC 
290 
activation was not modified. The expression of these lipogenic genes is mainly 
291 
  
10
controlled by two transcription factors, sterol response element binding protein-1c 
292 
(SREBP-1c) and carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP). Although 
293 
the amount of ChREBP in nuclear extracts remained unaffected (Figure 1G), the protein 
294 
expression of the mature form of SREBP-1c was significantly increased only in hepatic 
295 
nuclear extracts taken from fructose-supplemented rats (Figure 1H).  
296 
 
 
As shown in Table 2, only glucose-supplemented animals displayed higher 
297 
plasma adiponectin levels than controls (2.6-fold increase), which correlates with 
298 
increased mRNA expression of the adiponectin gene in adipose tissue of this group (by 
299 
2.6-fold, Table 2). It has been shown that stimulation of adiponectin signalling activates 
300 
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), a key factor in the transcriptional 
301 
control of genes encoding fatty acid β-oxidation enzymes (29). Western blot analysis 
302 
revealed that the expression of hepatic PPARα was significantly increased only in the 
303 
nuclear extracts from glucose-supplemented rats (by 1.3-fold) (Figure 2A). 
304 
Accordingly, the mRNA levels of PPARα target genes, such as liver carnitine 
305 
palmitoyl-CoA transferase-I (l-cpt-1a) and acyl-CoA oxidase (aco), were significantly 
306 
increased only in the liver of glucose-supplemented animals (Figure 2B, C). When we 
307 
determined L-CPT-1A protein levels, we found no significant difference between the 
308 
glucose-supplemented and the control group. However, the protein level of L-CPT-1A 
309 
was significantly reduced in liver samples taken from fructose-supplemented rats (by 
310 
0.5-fold, Figure 2D). Since the amount of plasma triglycerides not only depends on the 
311 
balance between the synthesis and catabolism of fatty acids in the liver, but also on the 
312 
export of triglycerides from hepatocytes, we also determined the protein expression of 
313 
microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP). This protein is essential for the 
314 
assembly and secretion of very-low density lipoproteins (VLDL) by the liver. As shown 
315 
in Figure 2E, MTP protein expression was increased only in fructose-supplemented rats.   
316 
 
 
Supplementation with fructose and glucose impairs insulin signalling in 
317 
aorta and liver  
318 
 
 
Plasma glucose concentrations were not altered after simple sugar 
319 
supplementation (Table 2). On the other hand, fructose increased plasma insulin 
320 
concentration (by 2.4-fold) and the glucose-supplemented group showed a tendency 
321 
(P=0.07) to higher plasma insulin level. Thus, the insulin sensitivity index (ISI) was 
322 
significantly reduced in both glucose- and fructose-supplemented rats (Table 2), 
323 
suggesting that insulin signalling could be impaired in these groups. Therefore, we 
324 
analyzed the expression of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and IRS-2, the main 
325 
  
11
insulin signal transducers in the liver and in aortic tissue. Our results show that the 
326 
protein expression of hepatic IRS-1 was not altered by sugar supplementation (Figure 
327 
3A), but IRS-2 expression was significantly reduced in both groups (by 0.5-fold in 
328 
glucose-supplemented and by 0.4-fold in fructose-supplemented animals, Figure 3B). 
329 
On the other hand, both IRS-1 and IRS-2 protein levels were reduced in aortic tissue 
330 
from fructose- and glucose-supplemented rats (Figure 3C, D). We also determined the 
331 
expression of V-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog-2 (Akt), one of the main 
332 
transducers of insulin signalling downstream of IRS in both tissues. The amount of 
333 
phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) was significantly reduced only in the livers of fructose-
334 
supplemented rats in comparison with the control group, whereas total Akt protein 
335 
remained unaffected by both sugars (Figure 3E). Similarly, in aortic tissues the 
336 
expression of p-Akt was significantly reduced only in fructose-fed animals and total Akt 
337 
expression was not significantly modified by sugar supplementation (Figure 3F). 
338 
 
 
Supplementation with glucose and fructose alters relaxation responses of 
339 
aortic rings to a NO donor 
340 
 
 
Relaxation to ACh was used to examine the effect of simple sugars on the 
341 
receptor-mediated endothelium-dependent release of NO. No significant differences in 
342 
responses to ACh (10-8-10-5 M) occurred between aortic rings from the control, glucose- 
343 
and fructose-supplemented groups (Figure 4A). Both the sensitivity of aortic rings to 
344 
ACh as assessed by -log[EC50] (pD2) and the Emax to ACh were similar in all groups 
345 
(Figure 4A, Table 3). Similar to the findings for ACh, the sensitivity and Emax to BK, 
346 
another receptor-mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilator agent were not affected 
347 
by sugar supplementation (Figure 4B, Table 3). However, there was a significant 
348 
rightward shift of BK response curve in aortic rings from fructose-supplemented rats 
349 
relative to control animals (Figure 4B). 
350 
 
 
Aortic relaxation responses to a NO donor were also investigated by performing 
351 
concentration response curves to SNP (10-9-10-5 M). Although the Emax to SNP was 
352 
similar in all groups (Table 3), supplementation with glucose significantly augmented 
353 
the responsiveness of aortic rings to SNP. On the other hand, fructose supplementation 
354 
significantly attenuated the sensitivity of aortic rings to SNP (Figure 4C, Table 3). 
355 
 
 
Glucose (but not fructose) supplementation reduces the contractile response 
356 
of aortic rings  
357 
 
 
Eight week fructose supplementation did not affect vasoconstrictor responses of 
358 
rat aorta to PE, as shown in Figure 5A and Table 3. However, PE-induced maximal 
359 
  
12
contractions were significantly reduced in aortic rings from glucose-supplemented rats 
360 
compared with controls (Figure 5A, Table 3). Despite PE contractile responses were 
361 
affected by glucose supplementation, the mRNA expression of α1-adrenergic receptors 
362 
was unchanged (Table 5). To study the possible role of basal NO, PE response curves 
363 
were performed in aortic rings before and after pre-treatment with the NO synthase 
364 
inhibitor L-NAME (200 μM, 20 min) in the presence of indomethacin (10 μM). The 
365 
difference in the contractile level to PE after addition of L-NAME would indicate the 
366 
extent of endothelial NO release (13, 20). Incubation of the aortic rings with L-NAME 
367 
resulted in a significant increase of the contractile responses to PE in all groups (Figure 
368 
5C-E). However, the ΔAUC, defined as difference in the area under the curve between 
369 
PE concentration response curve before and after L-NAME were only higher in aortae 
370 
of the rats supplemented with glucose compared to the control group (Table 4). 
371 
 
 
To investigate a mechanism by which NO release might have been increased in 
372 
glucose-supplemented 
rats, 
endothelial 
NO 
synthase 
(eNOS) 
activation 
by 
373 
phosphorylation was investigated. As shown in Figure 6A, the phosphorylation of 
374 
eNOS at Ser1177 was increased in aortic tissue from glucose- but not fructose-
375 
supplemented rats, whereas in the expression of total eNOS showed no significant 
376 
difference between the simple sugar supplemented groups and the control group.  
377 
 
 
On the other hand, protein levels of inducible NOS (iNOS) in aorta were 
378 
significantly increased only in the fructose-supplemented animals (by 1.8-fold) (Figure 
379 
6B). 
380 
In vitro adiponectin (but not glucose or fructose) treatment increases NO 
381 
level in EA.hy926 
382 
It is well known that adiponectin stimulates the synthesis of NO in endothelial 
383 
cells. Thus, the increase in adiponectin levels observed in glucose-supplemented rats 
384 
could be responsible for the elevated basal NO in this group. To test this hypothesis, we 
385 
determined the effects of adiponectin or high glucose or fructose on NO level in 
386 
endothelial EA.hy926 cells. As shown in Figure 7, incubation of Eahy926 cells with 25 
387 
mM glucose or fructose for 30 min did not alter cellular NO production, whereas 
388 
incubation with 5 and 15 µg/ml adiponectin, dose dependently (and significantly for the 
389 
highest concentration) increased NO levels in the cell culture supernatant. 
390 
 
 
Differential effects of fructose and glucose supplementation on intracellular 
391 
pathways related to aortic relaxation  
392 
  
13
 
 
To study the molecular mechanisms that could explain the differences in the 
393 
responses of aortic rings from rats supplemented with glucose or fructose, the 
394 
expression of several molecular mediators of vascular relaxation were examined. The 
395 
NO-dependent relaxation is mediated by cGMP signalling which leads to the 
396 
stimulation of a specific cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), resulting in the 
397 
phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) in Ser239 (44). Our 
398 
results show that the mRNA expression of soluble guanylate cyclase (gcsa1) in aortae 
399 
from fructose-supplemented rats was reduced by 0.8-fold compared to controls (Figure 
400 
8A). Neither the mRNA levels of the phosphodiesterase that hydrolyses cGMP (pde5) 
401 
(Figure 8A), nor the protein expression of protein kinase G (PKG) (Figure 8B) were 
402 
significantly modified by sugar supplementation. However, phosphorylation of VASP 
403 
in Ser239 was reduced in both sugar-supplemented groups vs control (Figure 8C), and 
404 
the amount of total VASP showed also a reduction, which was significant only in 
405 
fructose-supplemented rats (Figure 8D). 
406 
 
 
The NO-independent vasodilatory pathway in large conduit arteries is mainly 
407 
controlled by cAMP levels resulting in the phosphorylation of VASP in Ser157 (44). 
408 
Aortic tissue adenylyl cyclase (AC6) mRNA levels and phosphorylation of protein 
409 
kinase A (PKAc) in Thr197 were not significantly modified by sugar supplementation 
410 
compared to control rats, although fructose-supplemented rats showed reduced values 
411 
compared to the glucose group (Figure 8A, F). Fructose supplementation significantly 
412 
increased the mRNA and protein expression (by 1.9-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively) of 
413 
phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), which specifically catalyzes the hydrolysis of cAMP 
414 
(Figure 8A, G). Thus, the combined reduction of total VASP and the putative decrease 
415 
of cAMP levels may explain the significant reduction of VASP Ser157 phosphorylation 
416 
(by 1.46-fold) which was observed only in fructose-supplemented rats (Figure 8E).  
417 
 
 
Finally, in order to rapidly identify possible changes in other pathways involved 
418 
in the vascular effects of simple sugars, we measured the mRNA level of a broad range 
419 
of genes associated with vascular function. As shown in Table 5, the mRNA expression 
420 
of genes and enzymes such as angiotensin II and BK receptors, cyclooxygenases, 
421 
prostacyclin synthase or thromboxane synthase, which have been reported to be 
422 
involved in aortic reactivity, remained unaffected by sugar supplementation. Although 
423 
we are aware that mRNA expression and protein abundance are not always well 
424 
correlated, the lack of effect of sugar supplementation on the mRNAs analyzed 
425 
  
14
discouraged us from further studying the involvement of these pathways on the 
426 
observed vascular effects. 
427 
 
428 
 
 
Discussion  
429 
 
 
The adverse effects of simple sugar consumption on metabolic function are well 
430 
documented in human and animal studies (3, 49, 51), and there are also reports on the 
431 
effects of diets supplemented with fructose or high fructose corn syrup on vascular 
432 
reactivity in rodents (2, 5, 16, 31, 38). Most of these studies were performed on males, 
433 
but there is increasing awareness to include females in research studies. To our 
434 
knowledge we are the first to compare the effects of simple sugars (glucose or fructose) 
435 
consumption on female rat metabolic factors and aortic function. Here, we identify 
436 
some key molecular targets responsible for metabolic and vascular disturbances induced 
437 
by simple sugar supplementation in liquid form to female rats. We also provide 
438 
evidences that these effects are not merely a direct result of the amount of ingested 
439 
calories.  
440 
 
 
We previously reported that the ingestion of liquid fructose elicits an incomplete 
441 
compensatory reduction of solid food consumption in rats, leading to an increase in total 
442 
caloric intake (7, 41–43, 54, 55). Our current data show that when rats are supplemented 
443 
with a glucose solution, the compensatory response is even worse compared with 
444 
fructose supplementation, as liquid intake is higher and comparatively solid food 
445 
consumption is reduced to a lesser extent. As a result, the total caloric intake is higher in 
446 
rats receiving glucose than in rats with fructose supplementation (Table 2). It has been 
447 
suggested that if simple sugars cause any adverse effects on health, these effects are 
448 
exclusively due to the calories that the sugars provide (26). According to this 
449 
hypothesis, the metabolic and vascular alterations in the present study should have been 
450 
equal or more intense in glucose-supplemented rats. On the contrary, our results show 
451 
that compared with the fructose group, rats supplemented with liquid glucose exhibit 
452 
less adverse metabolic and vascular effects. Analysis of the results shown in Table 2 
453 
and Figure 3 indicates that both sugars impair insulin signalling in the liver and aortic 
454 
tissue, but the effect is far more intense in fructose- than in glucose-supplemented rats. 
455 
Although hepatic and aortic IRS-1/2 were reduced to a similar extent by glucose and 
456 
fructose, p-Akt was significantly decreased in the liver and aorta of fructose-
457 
supplemented animals only. This is in accordance with our previous results showing an 
458 
abnormal glucose tolerance test and reduced p-Akt in female rats supplemented with 
459 
  
15
10% liquid fructose, but not glucose, for 2 months (6). In the current study, insulin 
460 
resistance is observed not only in the liver but also in aortic tissues of fructose-
461 
supplemented animals, suggesting a common origin for both metabolic and vascular 
462 
dysfunction.  
463 
 
 
Moreover, our data shows that the hypertriglyceridemia appears only in fructose-
464 
supplemented rats. This observation cannot be explained solely by increased hepatic 
465 
lipogenesis, as both sugars induced the expression of major lipogenic genes. However, 
466 
fructose supplementation induced a more prominent effect (Figure 1). Hepatic 
467 
lipogenesis is controlled by two transcription factors, SREBP-1c and ChREBP (57). As 
468 
ChREBP is activated by phosphorylated intermediates derived from the direct 
469 
metabolism of dietary carbohydrates (1), the 12-h fasting period in our study explains 
470 
the lack of activation of this transcription factor (Figure 1G). On the contrary, activation 
471 
of SREBP-1c by carbohydrates is not a direct effect but it is mediated by an increase in 
472 
plasma insulin levels (57), a mechanism that is maintained in insulin resistance states 
473 
(24). In the present study, plasma insulin level was markedly elevated only in fructose-
474 
supplemented animals (Table 2), driving the increased expression of SREBP-1c in 
475 
hepatic nuclear extracts from this group (Figure 1H). 
476 
 
 
Regarding lipid catabolism, fructose supplementation did not affect hepatic 
477 
PPARα nuclear content or the mRNA expression of l-cpt-1a, a PPARα target gene. 
478 
However, when we determined the protein expression of L-CPT-1A, we observed a 
479 
significant decrease in the liver of the fructose-supplemented rats (Figure 2D). L-CPT-
480 
1A catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the hepatic mitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty 
481 
acids, suggesting that this process may be inhibited in the liver by fructose 
482 
supplementation. On the contrary, fructose increased the hepatic expression of MTP, a 
483 
protein which is essential for the assembly of triglycerides into VLDL and for the 
484 
secretion of these lipoproteins (17). This effect had been already reported in fructose-
485 
fed hamsters, and was correlated to hepatic insulin resistance (11, 50). Taking these 
486 
results together, the hypertriglyceridemia observed in the fructose-supplemented rats 
487 
may arise from the combined effects of increased lipogenesis, reduced fatty acid 
488 
catabolism and enhanced triglyceride export from liver to plasma in the form of VLDL 
489 
through MTP induction.  
490 
 
 
On the other hand, plasma adiponectin level is increased in glucose-
491 
supplemented rats, which correlates with increased mRNA expression of adiponectin in 
492 
adipose tissue of this group (Table 2). Although the mechanism responsible for this 
493 
  
16
inductive effect is unclear, our results suggest that the overexpression of hepatic PPARα 
494 
in this group may be due to the elevated level of adiponectin. This theory is supported 
495 
by other reports showing that adiponectin up-regulates PPARα expression (58). It 
496 
should be noted that despite PPARα induction and elevated l-cpt-1a mRNA in the 
497 
glucose-supplemented group, we did not observe increased hepatic CPT-1A protein 
498 
expression, suggesting that fatty acid oxidation is not induced by glucose 
499 
supplementation. Overall, our results on the decreased L-CPT-1A protein levels in 
500 
fructose-supplemented rats suggest that simple sugars might affect L-CPT-1A protein 
501 
stability, causing a reduction in its hepatic content. However, this effect is counteracted 
502 
in glucose-supplemented rats, possibly via the control of its expression by increased 
503 
PPARα. 
504 
 
 
It has been shown that adiponectin stimulates NO production in vascular 
505 
endothelial cells (12), and therefore the enhanced basal NO in aortae of glucose- 
506 
supplemented rats (Table 4) may result from an increased adiponectin in this group. In 
507 
the current study, we assessed the in vitro effects of adiponectin or high glucose or 
508 
fructose on NO level by measuring NO metabolites. Treatment of EA.hy926 with 
509 
adiponectin but not high glucose or fructose caused a significant increased in NO level 
510 
in these cells (Figure 7). These results exclude a direct effect of glucose on NO 
511 
production and suggest that elevated adiponectin is the possible cause of increased NO 
512 
in aortae of glucose-supplemented rats. Moreover, it has been reported that adiponectin 
513 
stimulates the synthesis of NO in endothelial cells by phosphorylation of eNOS at 
514 
Ser1177 (12, 15), and our results show that eNOS phosphorylation at this position is 
515 
increased in aortic tissues from glucose-supplemented rats (Figure 6A). Taken together, 
516 
these results suggest that the increase in basal NO after glucose supplementation could 
517 
be mainly attributed to the hyperadiponectinaemia observed in this group. 
518 
 
 
Elevated basal NO in aortae from glucose-supplemented rats may also, in part, 
519 
explain decreased vasoconstrictor response to PE in this group (Figure 5B). In addition, 
520 
the fact that the SNP-induced relaxation was increased in the glucose-supplemented 
521 
group suggests that the increased sensitivity of intact aorta to NO may also contribute to 
522 
the decreased PE contractile responsiveness. It is important to note that glucose 
523 
supplementation enhanced aortic responses to SNP despite a decrease in 
524 
phosphorylation of VASP at Ser239 and preserved PKG expression, suggesting that 
525 
VASP phosphorylation or upstream cGMP-dependent phosphorylation of VASP is not a 
526 
mechanism for the increased relaxation response to SNP. Along similar lines, Aszódi et 
527 
  
17
al. observed an intact relaxation after exposure to cGMP and cAMP in aortic rings of 
528 
VASP-null mice (4). Furthermore, Yousif et al. (60) reported that SNP induces cGMP-
529 
independent vasodilator responses in the perfused rabbit ovarian vascular bed.  Unlike 
530 
the glucose-supplemented group, our data show that SNP-induced relaxation is 
531 
significantly reduced in aortic rings of the fructose-supplemented rats. Assessments of 
532 
vasodilatory responses in the presence of a soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor or a PKG 
533 
inhibitor/activator could help to determine how fructose and glucose differentially 
534 
influence the NO/cGMP/PKG relaxation pathways.  
535 
 
 
EDV is used as a reproducible parameter to investigate endothelial function 
536 
under various pathological conditions. In the present study, we showed a preserved 
537 
EDV of the aorta in the sugar-supplemented rats despite the altered relaxation responses 
538 
to SNP. Accordingly, Mourmoura et al. (33) reported that the EDV of coronary arteries 
539 
was fully maintained while the response to a NO donor was even enhanced in type 2 
540 
diabetic rats. Both impairment (16, 31, 38) or no change  (23, 36) of EDV in vessels 
541 
from fructose-supplemented rats have been reported. The varied vasodilatory responses 
542 
after sugar supplementation may be attributed to differences in the type of the agents 
543 
used, animal’s sex and strain, vascular beds, and duration of sugar supplementation.  
544 
 
 
NO has been generally considered as the principal mediator of EDV in normal 
545 
state in large arteries, and impaired EDV is often associated with reduced bioavailability 
546 
of NO. However prostaglandin I2 (PGI2), and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing 
547 
factor (EDHF) may also be important regulators of vascular tone and reactivity in 
548 
diabetes. There is an established negative regulatory effect of NO on EDHF synthesis 
549 
(8). On the other hand, an augmented EDHF response was shown to compensate for the 
550 
loss of NO-mediated vasorelaxation in arteries in diabetic rats (46). In agreement with 
551 
those studies that demonstrate compensatory interactions between pathways, the 
552 
preserved ACh response (regardless of altered SNP responses) suggest that other 
553 
molecules besides NO (e.g. EDHF or PGI2) may be involved in ACh relaxation. The 
554 
fact that AC6 mRNA and phosphorylated PKA protein levels were significantly reduced 
555 
in aorta taken from fructose rats (Figure 8A, F) suggests that the preserved ACh 
556 
responses in the arteries of this group is likely due to the elevated EDHF (rather than 
557 
increased PGI2). Furthermore, we demonstrated that fructose- but not glucose-
558 
supplementation enhances PDE4 mRNA and protein expression (Figure 8A, G). The 
559 
elevated PDE4 expression and subsequent reduction in cAMP levels may specifically 
560 
hinder phosphorylation of VASP at Ser157 (Figure 8E). This effect combined with 
561 
  
18
reduced VASP expression (Fig 8D) possibly leads to an impairment of NO-independent 
562 
relaxation in aortae of fructose-supplemented rats.  
563 
 
 
Another mechanism that could account for the difference between the response 
564 
to ACh and SNP could be oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), particularly 
565 
superoxide anions, inactivate NO which could lead to a reduction of SNP potency. In 
566 
order to examine this possibility, we measured the mRNA expression of the catalytic 
567 
subunits of NADPH oxidase Nox1 and Nox4, major source of ROS in vascular cells 
568 
(19). However, we did not see significant differences in the mRNA expression for Nox1 
569 
and Nox4 in the aorta of experimental animals (Table 5).  
570 
 
 
It has been shown that under metabolic stress conditions iNOS is able to produce 
571 
an abnormal amount of NO leading to ROS production and decreased bioavailability of 
572 
NO. Although we did not measure ROS production and NO bioavailability, we 
573 
observed a significant induction of iNOS protein expression in aortic tissues from 
574 
fructose-supplemented rats (Figure 6B), which could in part lead to vascular 
575 
dysfunction in this group (35). Vascular dysfunction in metabolic syndrome may also be 
576 
associated with increased vasoconstrictor sensitivity (47). Here, however, we showed 
577 
that fructose supplementation did not affect vasoconstrictor responses to PE. Along 
578 
similar lines, no differences were reported in the vasoconstrictor responses to PE in 
579 
mesenteric arteries (36) or aortic rings (23) from fructose-fed rats.  
 
 
580 
 
 
In conclusion, we have shown that dietary supplementation with liquid glucose 
581 
or fructose causes metabolic and vascular alterations in female rats.  Despite higher 
582 
caloric intake in glucose-supplemented rats, fructose caused worse metabolic and 
583 
vascular responses. This may be due to the elevated adiponectin level and the 
584 
subsequent enhancement of PPARα and eNOS phosphorylation in glucose-
585 
supplemented rats, a mechanism which is absent in the fructose group. Clearly, 
586 
additional studies will be needed to document the direction and magnitude of these 
587 
interactions in sugar-supplemented rats along with the relative importance of elevated 
588 
adiponectin level to metabolic and vascular function in the glucose-supplemented rats.
