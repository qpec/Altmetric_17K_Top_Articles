World TB Day — March 24, 2017
World TB Day is recognized each year on March 24, which 
commemorates the date in 1882 when Dr. Robert Koch 
announced his discovery of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the 
bacillus that causes tuberculosis (TB). World TB Day provides 
an opportunity to raise awareness about TB and the measures 
needed to tackle this devastating disease. In 2017, for the 
second year, CDC will join the global Stop TB Partnership 
in adopting the World TB Day theme “Unite to End TB.” 
In 2016, a total of 9,287 new TB cases occurred in the 
United States (incidence of 2.9 cases per 100,000 persons) 
(1), a decrease from the 2015 case count and incidence. This 
2016 provisional case count represents the lowest number of 
TB cases recorded since reporting began in 1953. However, 
data suggest that current strategies will not be sufficient to 
reach the goal of U.S. TB elimination during this century (2).
CDC is committed to eliminating TB in the United States. 
This will require expanded initiatives, both in the United States 
and globally. These initiatives must maintain and strengthen 
existing strategies for diagnosing and treating persons with TB 
disease and also increase testing and treatment of persons with 
latent TB infection as outlined in CDC recommendations and 
the 2016 recommendation from the U.S. Preventive Services 
Task Force (USPSTF) (3,4). Additional information about 
World TB Day and CDC’s TB elimination activities is available 
on CDC’s TB website (https://www.cdc.gov/tb/worldtbday).

In 2016, a total of 9,287 new tuberculosis (TB) cases were 
reported in the United States; this provisional* count represents 
the lowest number of U.S. TB cases on record and a 2.7% 
decrease from 2015 (1). The 2016 TB incidence of 2.9 cases 
per 100,000 persons represents a slight decrease compared 
with 2015 (-3.4%) (Figure). However, epidemiologic model-
ing demonstrates that if similar slow rates of decline continue, 
the goal of U.S. TB elimination will not be reached during 
this century (2). Although current programs to identify and 
treat active TB disease must be maintained and strengthened, 
increased measures to identify and treat latent TB infection 
(LTBI) among populations at high risk are also needed to 
accelerate progress toward TB elimination.

February 17, 2017. Updated data will be available in CDC’s annual TB 
surveillance report later this year.

Health departments in the 50 states and District of Columbia 
(DC) electronically report to CDC† verified cases of TB 
that meet the CDC and Council of State and Territorial 
Epidemiologists case definition for TB. Reports include demo-
graphic and clinical information, as well as medical and social 
risk factors for TB disease. Persons reported with TB are classi-
fied as U.S.-born or foreign-born persons based on established 
criteria§; race/ethnicity is self-reported. U.S. Census Bureau 
midyear population estimates provide the denominators used 
to calculate TB incidence overall (3). The Current Population 
Survey (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps.html) 
provides the population denominators used to calculate TB 
incidence according to national origin and racial/ethnic group.
State-specific TB incidence in 2016 ranged from 0.2 cases per 
100,000 persons in Wyoming to 8.3 in Hawaii (median state 
incidence = 1.9). Twelve states (Alaska, Arkansas, California, 
Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, 
New York, North Dakota, and Texas) and DC reported 
incidence higher than the national incidence (Table 1). As 
in previous years, four states (California, Florida, New York, 
and Texas) reported >500 cases each in 2016, accounting for 
50.9% of reported cases nationwide.
Among 9,287 TB cases reported in 2016, U.S.-born per-
sons accounted for 2,935 (31.6%) cases, and 6,307 (67.9%) 
cases occurred among foreign-born persons; 45 (0.5%) cases 
occurred among persons whose national origin was not known 
(Table 2). TB incidence among U.S.-born persons (1.1 cases 
per 100,000) decreased 8.4% from 2015 (Figure). Incidence 
among foreign-born persons (14.6 cases per 100,000) decreased 
3.2% from 2015, but was approximately 14 times the incidence 
among U.S.-born persons.
Among U.S.-born persons, TB incidence remained stable 
among non-Hispanic whites (0.5 cases per 100,000) and Asians 
(2.1), but decreased from 2015 in all other racial/ethnic groups 
including Hispanics (1.6 [-11.4%]), non-Hispanic blacks (3.0 
[-6.8%]), American Indian/Alaska Natives (5.0 [-28.8%]), and 
Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders (9.2 [-27.3%]) (Table 2). TB 
incidence has decreased or remained stable since 2013 in all 
U.S.-born racial/ethnic groups except American Indian/Alaska 
Natives and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders, which experi-
enced increases during this period before decreasing in 2016.
Among foreign-born persons, the highest TB incidence in 
2016 was among Asians (26.9 cases per 100,000), followed by 
non-Hispanic blacks (22.3) and Hispanics (10.0), and most 
foreign-born racial/ethnic groups have experienced gradual 
decreases between 2013 and 2016. The top five countries 
of origin for foreign-born persons reported with TB disease 
in the United States were Mexico (1,194 cases, 18.9% of all 
foreign-born cases), the Philippines (795, 12.6%), India (593,

§ U.S.-born persons are defined as persons who were born in the United States 
or a U.S. island area or born abroad to a U.S. citizen parent or parents. All 
others, including those who have become U.S. citizens through naturalization, 
are considered to be foreign-born persons.

9.4%), Vietnam (496, 7.9%), and China (383, 6.1%). Cases 
in persons born in these countries accounted for 54.9% of all 
cases among foreign-born persons.
HIV status was known for 86.7% of TB cases reported in 
2016; among these patients, 5.8% had documented HIV co-
infection. Living in congregate settings such as shelters, long-
term care facilities, and correctional facilities is a known risk 
factor for TB exposure (4), and complete data on these risk 
factors were available for >93% of cases. Among these, 4.6% 
of patients reported having experienced homelessness in the 
year preceding diagnosis. In addition, 1.8% were reported as 
residing in a long-term care facility, and 3.5% were reported as 
being confined in a correctional facility at the time of diagnosis.
The most recent year for which complete drug-susceptibility 
data are available is 2015; the data include test results for 98.7% 
of culture-confirmed TB cases. In 2015, 88 cases of multidrug-
resistant TB¶ occurred; multidrug-resistant TB accounted for 
0.4% and 1.2% of culture-confirmed TB cases among U.S.-
born and foreign-born persons, respectively. Among the 88 
multidrug-resistant TB cases, 72 (81.8%) occurred in persons 
¶ Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) is defined by the World Health 
Organization as a case of TB in a person with a Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
isolate resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin.

Discussion
Provisional data for 2016 demonstrate a slight decline in both 
TB case count and incidence in the United States compared 
with 2015. However, previously published epidemiologic 
modeling suggests that maintaining similar rates of decline in 
the future will not be sufficient to achieve TB elimination in 
the United States during this century (2). Current TB control 
priorities, including early identification of TB cases, prompt 
institution of appropriate treatment, and identification of 
exposed contacts remain critical to preventing a resurgence 
of TB; to achieve TB elimination, expanded measures and 
new strategies are needed. Epidemiologic models demonstrate 
that identifying and treating persons with LTBI (a condition 
that occurs when a person is infected with Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis without signs and symptoms, or radiographic or 
bacteriologic evidence of TB disease) is critical to accomplish-
ing the goal of TB elimination (2). This strategy is consistent 
with CDC recommendations as well as 2016 recommenda-
tions from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 
to screen for LTBI with tests such as the tuberculin skin test 
or interferon-gamma release assay in populations that are at 
increased risk for TB (4,5). The USPSTF characterizes popula-
tions at increased risk as those persons who were born in, or 
formerly resided in, countries with increased TB prevalence 
as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) (6); 
and persons who currently live in, or have lived in high-risk 
congregate settings such as homeless shelters, correctional 
facilities, and long-term care facilities.
In 2016, four of the top five countries of origin for foreign-
born persons reported with TB disease were considered high 
TB burden countries by WHO (China, India, Philippines, 
Vietnam), and accounted for 36% of incident TB cases among 
foreign-born persons in the United States (6). Because approxi-
mately 90% of TB cases in foreign-born persons in the United 
States are attributable to reactivation of LTBI, targeted testing 
for and treatment of LTBI among foreign-born persons from 
countries with high TB prevalence could be an effective strategy 
to decrease TB incidence (7). The current recommendation 
from the USPSTF to test persons at increased risk regardless of 
length of time in the United States is in keeping with evidence 
that reactivation of LTBI remains a substantial concern, even 
in foreign-born persons who have lived in the United States 
for many years (8,9).
Workers in high-risk congregate settings are also at increased 
risk for TB and should be included as part of a targeted test-
ing and treatment approach (4). Other persons at risk for TB 
infection or for progression from LTBI to TB disease who 
should also be included in this strategy include close contacts 
of infectious TB patients, persons with immunosuppression, 
persons with other medical conditions (e.g., diabetes mellitus, 
chronic renal failure, or silicosis) associated with progression 
from LTBI to TB disease, and persons with fibrotic changes 
on a chest radiograph suggestive of inactive TB disease (4).
The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. 
First, this analysis is limited to reported provisional case counts and 
incidence rates for 2016. Second, incidence rates are calculated 
based on estimated population denominators for 2016.
Although TB case counts and incidence are decreasing in 
the United States, progress is insufficient to achieve in this 
century the goal of TB elimination. Measures to diagnose 
and treat active TB disease must continue, and new strategies 
aimed at accelerating progress toward TB elimination in the 
United States, such as targeted testing for and treatment of 
LTBI, should also be employed. Expanded partnerships with 
health care providers outside of the public health sector will be 
important in effectively implementing such a strategy.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
An annual decline in the number of cases and incidence of 
tuberculosis (TB) in the United States was found beginning in 
1993 and continuing until 2015, when the case count increased 
and the incidence remained the same as the previous year.
What is added by this report?
Provisional data for 2016 indicate a decreased TB case count 
and incidence compared with 2015.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Current strategies are effective in controlling TB, but not 
sufficient to promote progress toward the goal of eliminating 
TB in the United States. Current TB control priorities remain 
important to prevent a resurgence of TB, but expanded 
measures and new strategies are needed to achieve TB 
elimination. Targeted testing and treatment of latent TB 
infection in populations at high risk for TB are key strategies for 
lowering incidence and moving toward elimination.
 
** Extensively drug-resistant TB is defined by the World Health Organization 
as a case of TB in a person with a Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolate with 
resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampin among first-line anti-TB drugs, 
resistance to any fluoroquinolone (e.g., ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin), and 
resistance to at least one of three second-line injectable drugs (i.e., amikacin, 
capreomycin, or kanamycin).
