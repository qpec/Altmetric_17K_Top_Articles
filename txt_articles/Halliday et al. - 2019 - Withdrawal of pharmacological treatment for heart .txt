Summary
Background Patients with dilated cardiomyopathy whose symptoms and cardiac function have recovered often ask 
whether their medications can be stopped. The safety of withdrawing treatment in this situation is unknown.
Methods We did an open-label, pilot, randomised trial to examine the effect of phased withdrawal of heart failure 
medications in patients with previous dilated cardiomyopathy who were now asymptomatic, whose left ventricular 
ejection fraction (LVEF) had improved from less than 40% to 50% or greater, whose left ventricular end-diastolic 
volume (LVEDV) had normalised, and who had an N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) 
concentration less than 250 ng/L. Patients were recruited from a network of hospitals in the UK, assessed at one 
centre (Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK), and randomly assigned (1:1) to phased 
withdrawal or continuation of treatment. After 6 months, patients in the continued treatment group had treatment 
withdrawn by the same method. The primary endpoint was a relapse of dilated cardiomyopathy within 6 months, 
defined by a reduction in LVEF of more than 10% and to less than 50%, an increase in LVEDV by more than 10% and 
to higher than the normal range, a two-fold rise in NT-pro-BNP concentration and to more than 400 ng/L, or clinical 
evidence of heart failure, at which point treatments were re-established. The primary analysis was by intention to 
treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02859311.
Findings Between April 21, 2016, and Aug 22, 2017, 51 patients were enrolled. 25 were randomly assigned to the 
treatment withdrawal group and 26 to continue treatment. Over the first 6 months, 11 (44%) patients randomly 
assigned to treatment withdrawal met the primary endpoint of relapse compared with none of those assigned to 
continue treatment (Kaplan-Meier estimate of event rate 45·7% [95% CI 28·5–67·2]; p=0·0001). After 6 months, 
25 (96%) of 26 patients assigned initially to continue treatment attempted its withdrawal. During the following 
6 months, nine patients met the primary endpoint of relapse (Kaplan-Meier estimate of event rate 36·0% [95% CI 
20·6–57·8]). No deaths were reported in either group and three serious adverse events were reported in the treatment 
withdrawal group: hospital admissions for non-cardiac chest pain, sepsis, and an elective procedure.
Interpretation Many patients deemed to have recovered from dilated cardiomyopathy will relapse following treatment 
withdrawal. Until robust predictors of relapse are defined, treatment should continue indefinitely.

Introduction
Outcomes for patients with dilated cardiomyopathy vary, 
but for many the disease runs a benign course.1 An 
improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 
and reduction in left ventricle size is seen in around 
40% of patients.2 Plasma concentrations of natriuretic 
peptides might also normalise with treatment.3 Such 
patients are typically young with few comorbidities and 
have a good prognosis.3–6 Although some patients with 
improved function remain symptomatic,3 those with the 
greatest improvement are often rendered asymptomatic.7
Following resolution of symptoms and recovery in 
cardiac function, many patients ask whether it is 
necessary to continue lifelong treatment, especially if 
they are having side-effects. Patients are often young and 
reluctant to take medications for many years without 
evidence of continued benefit. Young women are often 
eager to stop treatment before attempting to become 
pregnant. Medications also represent a substantial 
financial burden for patients in some countries. Reducing 
the number of unnecessary medications might also 
improve overall wellbeing of patients.
Whether patients with a previous diagnosis of dilated 
cardiomyopathy and clinical, imaging, and biochemical 
markers of recovered cardiac function benefit from 
continuing treatment indefinitely is unknown. Some

patients with these features might have achieved 
permanent recovery and so continued treatment might be 
unnecessary. For others, relapse could occur if treatment 
is withdrawn. There is an absense of prospective data 
investigating treatment withdrawal in patients with 
recovered dilated cardiomyopathy and consequently no 
consensus among experts or clear recommendations in 
guidelines.8 Accordingly, we aimed to do a pilot study to 
examine the effect of treatment withdrawal in patients 
with clinical, imaging, and biochemical evidence of 
recovery from dilated cardiomyopathy.
Methods
Study design and patients
We did an open-label, pilot, randomised trial of phased 
withdrawal of pharmacological treatment for heart 
failure. Investigations were done at a single centre (Royal 
Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, 
London, UK). Patients were identified at the trial centre 
and participant identification centres in the UK (Guy’s 
and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, King’s College 
Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, St George’s NHS 
Foundation Trust, London Northwest NHS Healthcare 
Trust, Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals, and 
Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals). All 
patients provided written informed consent. The possible 
risk of heart failure and major arrhythmia was discussed. 
The trial was approved by the National Research Ethics 
Committee (16/LO/0065), to whom annual progress 
reports were submitted, and given NHS Permission by 
the Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Trust after 
review of study documentation and discussion of the 
risks and benefits. The trial was authorised by the 
Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency 
and annual development safety update reports were 
provided. The study design was discussed with the 
institutional patient advisory group and representatives 
from patient organ 
isations and was presented at the 
National Heart Failure Patient Health Care Professional 
Research Forum, receiving positive feedback. A senior 
heart failure expert was appointed as an independent 
trial data monitor, who reviewed study conduct and 
adverse events at scheduled meetings, was informed of 
serious adverse events as they occurred, and had the 
authority to terminate the trial if deemed necessary. 
Serious adverse events were reported to the trial sponsor 
within 24 h as per the protocol. The trial is registered on 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02859311, and the trial 
protocol is included in the appendix.
Inclusion criteria comprised a previous diagnosis of 
dilated cardiomyopathy with LVEF 40% or lower;9 
absence of current symptoms of heart failure; current 
treatment with a loop diuretic, beta-blocker, angiotensin-
converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, angiotensin receptor 
blocker (ARB), or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist 
(MRA), or a combination of these drugs; a current LVEF 
of 50% or greater and a left ventricular end diastolic 
volume indexed to body surface area (LVEDVi) within the 
normal range on cardiovascular magnetic resonance 
(CMR);10 and plasma N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic 
peptide (NT-pro-BNP) concentration less than 250 ng/L.
Exclusion criteria comprised uncontrolled hypertension 
(clinic blood pressure >160/100 mm Hg); valvular disease 
of moderate or greater severity; estimated glomerular 
filtration rate less than  30 mL/min per 1·73 m²; atrial, 
supra- 
ventricular, or ventricular arrhythmia requiring 
beta-blockade; pregnancy; angina; and age younger than 
16 years.
Patients were identified from a registry, from clinics at 
the study centre and participant identification centres, 
and from patient organisations. Potential participants 
were invited for a screening visit and underwent 
comprehensive assessment. Imaging was done on a 
3-Tesla scanner (Skyra, Siemens Healthcare; Erlangen, 
Germany) with a standardised protocol including late 
gadolinium enhancement imaging, T1 and extracellular 
volume 
(ECV) 
mapping, 
and 
strain 
assessment 
(appendix). Patients with contraindications to MRI 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed using the terms “recovered ejection 
fraction”, “left ventricular reverse remodelling”, “dilated 
cardiomyopathy”, “therapy withdrawal”, and “treatment 
withdrawal” for randomised or observational studies published 
up to Sept 3, 2018. We did not limit the search to English 
language publications. Previous reports about treatment 
withdrawal in patients with recovered dilated cardiomyopathy 
have been based on retrospective case-note reviews of 
populations with varying levels of recovery. The need for 
continued pharmacological heart failure treatment in patients 
with recovered dilated cardiomyopathy is unclear. Patients 
frequently ask to stop medications and are given conflicting 
medical guidance.
Added value of this study
The results of the TRED-HF trial suggest that around four in 
ten patients with recovered dilated cardiomyopathy will have a 
relapse within 6 months of starting phased withdrawal of 
pharmacological treatment for heart failure.
Implications of all the available evidence
Data from this randomised trial suggest that treatment should 
not usually be withdrawn in patients with recovered dilated 
cardiomyopathy. If a patient wishes to initiate treatment 
withdrawal, cardiac function should be monitored carefully and, 
until more information is available, indefinitely. Further research 
might identify subgroups of patients in whom pharmacological 
treatment for heart failure can be safely withdrawn.

underwent echoc 
ardiography with three-dimensional 
assessment of LV volumes (appendix). Blood was drawn 
for plasma NT-pro-BNP (Roche; Basel, Switzerland). 
Patients underwent a symptom-limited treadmill cardio- 
pulmonary exercise test (CPET) with one of three ramp 
protocols (appendix). The protocol was selected on the 
basis of perceived exercise tolerance with the aim of 
completing the test within 8–12 min.11 Patients completed 
the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) 
and a heart failure symptom assessment questionnaire 
(SAQ; appendix). 
All patients provided informed consent and were 
enrolled if all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion 
criteria were met. Diagnosis and possible cause of 
dilated cardiomyopathy was confirmed by consultant 
cardiologists with expertise in cardiomyopathy.
To gain insight into potential determinants of relapse, 
genetic sequencing was done with the TruSight Cardio 
Sequencing kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Rare 
protein-altering variants were identified and interpreted 
as set out in guidelines. Further details about the 
sequencing are provided in the appendix.12 We focused 
on 12 genes with the most robust evidence for association 
with dilated cardiomyopathy: TTN, DSP, MYH7, LMNA, 
TNNT2, TCAP, SCN5A, BAG3, TNNC1, VCL, TPM1, and 
RBM20.13 A rare variant was defined as an ExAC filtering 
allele frequency less than 8·4 × 10–⁵.14 For TTN, only 
truncating variants that affect exons constitutively 
expressed in the heart were included.15
Randomisation and masking
Patients were randomly assigned, by use of an online 
service, in random permuted blocks to supervised phased 
withdrawal or to continue treatment in a 1:1 allocation 
ratio, stratified by plasma NT-pro-BNP (0–50 ng/L, 
50–125 ng/L, and 125–250 ng/L). This initial randomised 
phase of the study took place over 6 months (figure 1) 
and is outlined below. After 6 months, patients in 
the treatment withdrawal group completed the study 
and those initially assigned to continue treatment 
subsequently had phased withdrawal of treatment in the 
same way over the subsequent 6 months, as part of a 
single-arm crossover phase (figure 1). The study team, 
patients, and clinical teams knew which group the 
patient was assigned to. Patients were provided with 
labelled medications by the hospital pharmacy.
Procedures
Patients randomly assigned to treatment withdrawal 
underwent supervised, step-wise reduction in pharmaco-
logical treatment over a maximum of 16 weeks (figure 1). 
Patients were reviewed every 2 weeks. Changes to 
medication were made following each review. Clinic 
visits and NT-pro-BNP measurements occurred at least

every 4 weeks during withdrawal. Interim reviews took 
place via telephone if the patient remained asymptomatic 
between visits. Patients initially stopped or reduced the 
dose of loop diuretic, followed by MRA, beta-blocker, and 
finally ACE inhibitor or ARB. If the patient was taking 
the equivalent of, or less than 40 mg of frusemide or 
50 mg of spironolactone, or 25% or less of the maximum 
recommended dose of beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, or 
ARB, the medication was stopped. If the patient was 
taking a larger dose, this was reduced by 50% in a 
stepwise manner every 2 weeks. Further information 
about the algorithm is included in the appendix. Patients 
in the control group underwent clinical review with 
NT-pro-BNP measurement after 8 weeks.
At 16 weeks, all patients underwent a clinical review 
that included measurement of NT-pro-BNP concentration 
and a CMR scan to ascertain LV volumes and function. 
Patients had a further review at 6 months, which included 
a CMR scan to ascertain LV volumes and function, 
measurement of plasma NT-pro-BNP concentration, and 
a CPET by use of the same protocol as in the baseline 
visit. Patients completed the KCCQ and SAQ. Two 
patients with existing contra 
indications to MRI and two 
in whom it became contra 
indicated had three-
dimensional echo 
cardiography (appendix).
The progress of patients was reviewed at weekly 
meetings by a panel of investigators led by a consultant 
cardiologist. Treatments were re-established if patients 
fulfilled any of the primary endpoint criteria described 
below. Management of patients who did not meet 
the primary endpoint but had adverse events, such as 
episodes of arrhythmia, was discussed by the panel 
with their clinical teams. Decisions about restarting 
treatment following such episodes were made on an 
individual basis. Patients who developed hypertension 
without meeting the primary endpoint were managed 
with indapamide and amlodipine. Those with a blood 
pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg who had diabetes 
or a 10-year cardiovascular risk of 20% or greater, and all 
those with a blood pressure greater than 160/100 mm Hg 
were started on hypertension treatment. All patients had 
24 h access to a trial or on-call doctor who was available 
via telephone and provided medical advice and follow-up 
as required. Management of patients at the end of the 
trial was ascertained by their clinical teams in line with 
the protocol.
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was a relapse of dilated 
cardiomyopathy within 6 months, defined by at least one 
of the following: a reduction in LVEF by more than 10% 
and to less than 50%; an increase in LVEDV by more 
than 10% and to higher than the normal range; a two-
fold rise in baseline NT-pro-BNP concentration and to 
more than 400 ng/L; or clinical evidence of heart failure, 
based on signs and symptoms as adjudicated by the 
research team.
Secondary endpoints comprised a composite safety 
endpoint (cardiovascular mortality, major adverse cardio-
vascular events, and unplanned cardiovascular hospital 
admission) and the occurrence of sustained atrial or 
ventricular arrhythmias. Changes between baseline 
and follow-up, in LVEF, LVEDVi, plasma NT-pro-BNP 
concentration, left atrial volume indexed to body surface 
area (LAVi), KCCQ and SAQ scores (with lower scores on 
the KCCQ and higher scores on the SAQ indicating 
greater symptom burden), exercise time and peak oxygen 
consumption on CPET, heart rate, and blood pressure 
were also assessed.
Cardiac volumetric analysis was done by a Core 
Laboratory using CMR Tools (Cardiovascular Imaging 
Solutions, London, UK). Operators were masked to the 
treatment group and stage. Serial scans from each patient 
were analysed by the same operator. NT-pro-BNP was 
measured with the Elecsys immunoassay (Roche; Basel, 
Switzerland) throughout the study.
In May, 2017, the sponsor contacted the independent 
data safety monitor as the primary endpoint rate was 
higher than expected. It was deemed appropriate to 
complete the trial as planned given the absence of serious 
adverse events at this stage and the response to treatment 
re-initiation of those who met the primary endpoint.
Statistical analysis
This was a pilot trial designed to assess the advisability 
and feasibility of doing a larger outcome trial, assuming 
that the pilot trial showed that the majority of patients 
could have treatment safely withdrawn without 
deterioration in cardiac function. The pilot trial was not 
prospectively powered to detect a difference in outcome. 
However, a retrospective power calculation showed that 
the sample size had 80% power to detect a difference in 
outcome, at a significance level of 5%, if the incidence 
of the primary endpoint in the intervention group 
was 26%, assuming there were no events in the 
control group.
Analysis was by intention to treat. Occurrence of the 
primary endpoint in the randomised phase of the study 
is graphically displayed per group with Kaplan-Meier 
survival plots and formally compared with the log-rank 
test. Baseline characteristics are presented according to 
assignment at randomisation and compared with the 
Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables or Fisher’s 
exact test for categorical variables. Data are presented as 
median and IQR or as n (%).
Secondary outcome variables were compared between 
groups in the randomised phase by use of a regression 
model in which the outcome variable at 6 months was the 
response variable and the treatment indicator and outcome 
variable at baseline were explanatory variables (ie, analysis 
of covariance). Skewed variables (eg, NT-pro-BNP) were 
log-transformed to achieve a more normal distribution.
Since the number of patients in each group was small, 
we did a non-randomised analysis comparing secondary

65
outcome variables immediately before treatment with- 
drawal versus 6 months later. This approach compared 
baseline versus 6-month values in patients randomly 
assigned to treatment withdrawal and 6-month versus 
1-year variables for those randomly assigned to the control 
group who underwent treatment withdrawal during the 
crossover phase. Comparisons were made via paired 
t tests. In a prespecified exploratory analysis, we used Cox 
proportional hazards models to investigate whether any 
characteristics predicted occurrence of the primary 
outcome among patients who underwent treatment 
withdrawal, including those in the crossover phase.
A p value less than 0·05 was taken as significant 
throughout. Statistical analyses were done with Stata, 
version 15.1.

Results
Between April 21, 2016, and Aug 22, 2017, 51 of 
63 screened patients met all inclusion criteria and none 
of the exclusion criteria and were randomly assigned and 
included in the intention-to-treat analysis (figure 2).
25 patients were randomly assigned to the treatment 
withdrawal group and 26 to the continued treatment 
group. Baseline characteristics were generally similar 
between the two groups (table 1). Among those randomly 
assigned to withdrawal versus those assigned to 
continued treatment, idiopathic dilated cardio 
myopathy 
(80% vs 58%), previous atrial fibrillation (32% vs 15%), 
and previous unplanned heart failure admissions (72% vs 
54%) were nominally more common. Overall, 34 (67%) 
patients were men and the median age was 55 years 
(IQR 45–64). The median LVEF at initial diagnosis was 
25% (IQR 20–33) and the median time since diagnosis

was 57 months (25–98) or 4·9 years (2·1–8·3) and time 
since recovery to LVEF greater than 50% was 24 months 
(6–43) or 2·0 years (0·7–3·5). At enrolment, all patients 
were in sinus rhythm, the median LVEF was 
60% (IQR 55–64) and median plasma NT-pro-BNP 
concentration was 72 ng/L (39–135). At enrolment, all 
patients were taking an ACE inhibitor or ARB, 45 (88%) 
were taking a beta-blocker, and 24 (47%) an MRA, but 
only six (12%) were taking a loop diuretic. The six patients 
not taking a beta-blocker had been prescribed one at 
initial diagnosis but this treatment had been stopped 
before enrolment. Eight patients also previously on an 
MRA had this drug discontinued before enrolment. One 
patient in the control group had previous implantation of 
a cardiac resynchronisation device with a defibrillator for 
primary prevention purposes while one patient in the 
withdrawal group had an implantable cardioverter 
defibrillator in situ for secondary prevention purposes.
35 (69%) patients had idiopathic dilated cardio-
myopathy, seven (14%) had familial dilated cardio-
myopathy, and nine (18%) had dilated cardiomyopathy 
secondary to a trigger including previous excess alcohol 
consumption, pregnancy, remote anthracycline admini-
stration, hyperthyroidism, and a previous episode of 
myocarditis. 39 (76%) patients (20 randomly assigned to 
treatment withdrawal and 19 to continue treatment) had 
coronary angiography with no evidence of obstructive 
disease (defined as a stenosis >50% in a major coronary 
artery) and a further four (8%; three randomly assigned 
to treatment withdrawal and one to continue treatment) 
had no evidence of ischaemia on nuclear or magnetic 
resonance stress imaging. Of the remaining eight (16%) 
patients (two randomly assigned to treatment withdrawal 
and six to continue treatment), seven (one randomly 
asssigned to treatment withdrawal and six to continue 
treatment) were younger than 50 years, none had 
evidence of myocardial infarction on imaging, and all 
were considered to have a low probability of coronary 
disease.
11 (22%) of 51 patients had a rare, constitutively 
expressed, truncating variant in TTN that was classified as 
being likely pathogenic (appendix). No other pathogenic 
or likely pathogenic variants were identified in genes 
associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (appendix).
Of the 25 patients initially randomly assigned to phased 
withdrawal of treatment, 11 (44%) met the primary 
endpoint criteria for relapse within 6 months compared 
with none of those assigned to continued treatment 
(figure 3). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the event rate at 
6 months in the withdrawal group was 45·7% (95% CI 
28·5–67·2; p=0·0001). One patient randomly assigned to 
withdrawal dropped out of the study after enrolment 
following further discussion with their cardiologist. After 
6 months, in the single-arm crossover phase of the study, 
25 (96%) of 26 patients initially assigned to continued 
treatment underwent phased withdrawal of treatment, 
nine of whom met the criteria for relapse during the 
following 6 months (Kaplan-Meier estimate of event rate 
36·0% [95% CI 20·6–57·8]; appendix). One patient did 
not undergo treatment withdrawal because of symptoms 
indicative of atrial fibrillation while on treatment during 
the first 6 months. Therefore, of the 50 patients who 
began withdrawal, 20 (40%) relapsed during the study 
period. 13 (26%) patients relapsed within 16 weeks of 
beginning withdrawal (eight in the treatment withdrawal 
group and five in the crossover phase), all of whom 
relapsed within 8 weeks of taking their last medication. 
Add 
itionally, four patients restarted heart failure 
treatment without meeting the primary endpoint, 
including two for hypertension refractory to treatment 
with other drugs (in the crossover phase), one following 
an episode of atrial fibrillation (in the crossover phase),

and one following an episode of non-sustained 
ventricular tachycardia (in the treatment withdrawal 
group; figure 2). Therefore, only 25 (50%) of 50 patients 
successfully completed 6 months of follow-up without re-
initiation of treatment.
Of the 20 patients who met the primary endpoint, 
ten fulfilled more than one criterion for relapse. 12 (60%) 
met the LVEF criterion for relapse, 11 (55%) met the 
LVEDVi criterion, nine (45%) met the NT-pro-BNP 
criterion, and one (5%) developed peripheral oedema 
(figure 4; appendix). Two patients developed shortness of 
breath upon moderate exertion (New York Heart 
Association Class [NYHA] II). Nine of ten patients who 
only met one endpoint criterion also had deterioration in 
at least one other variable that did not reach the prespecified 
threshold. The remaining patient had a reduction in LVEF 
from 52% at baseline to 41% at 16 weeks.
No deaths, unplanned hospital admissions for heart 
failure, or major adverse cardiovascular events were 
reported in either group. Three serious adverse events 
were reported in the treatment withdrawal group: hospital 
admissions for urinary sepsis, non-cardiac chest pain, 
and an elective procedure for a pre-existing condition. 
Neither patient with an implantable cardioverter-
defibrillator received treatment from the device. Three 
patients developed atrial fibrillation during treatment 
withdrawal, two of whom met the primary endpoint.
All patients who met the primary endpoint sub-
sequently restarted treatment. At the next follow-up, 
none of the patients had symptoms of heart failure 
(NYHA class I) and 17 (85%) of 20 had LVEF greater than 
50%. Two patients had improvements in LVEF to 
between 45–50% and one had a reduction in LVEF from 
48% to 43%, prompting intensification of medical 
therapy. In prespecified exploratory analyses to identify 
predictors of the primary endpoint, the following 
baseline characteristics were associated with increased 
risk of relapse in univariable analyses: advancing age 
(p=0·0309), prescription of an MRA before withdrawal 
(p=0·0042), prescription of more than two heart failure 
medications (p=0·0040), increased NT-pro-BNP concen 
tration (p=0·0161), and decreased peak global radial 
strain (p=0·0177; table 2). Patients with lower LVEF at 
original diagnosis and lower peak oxygen consumption 
on exercise tests seemed to have higher rates of relapse 
than those who did not, but these results were not 
significant. Familial dilated cardiomyopathy, presence of 
a truncating variant in TTN, LVEF at enrolment, time 
since original dilated cardiomyopathy diagnosis, and 
presence of late gadolinium enhancement were not 
significantly associated with the primary endpoint. How-
ever, the study was not adequately powered to detect such 
associations. Characteristics of patients who relapsed 
and those who did not are presented in the appendix.
With regard to secondary endpoints between groups in 
the randomised phase, treatment withdrawal was 
associated with a significant decline in LVEF, a significant 
increase in heart rate and diastolic blood pressure, and a 
significant decline in KCCQ score (table 3, figure 5). The 
effect of treatment withdrawal on other secondary 
variables was not significant; however, we observed non-
significant increases in LVEDVi, systolic blood pressure, 
and log NT-pro-BNP (table 3).

withdrawal attempted and completed follow-up (n=49), 
we observed a significant reduction in LVEF and a 
significant increase in LVEDVi, log NT-pro-BNP, heart 
rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure 
(table 4). In the analysis of patients who did not meet the 
primary endpoint, we observed a significant decline in 
LVEF and a significant increase in heart rate, systolic 
blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure (table 4).
Of the 50 patients who began treatment withdrawal, 
eight (16%) had a potentially reversible insult, including 
four with previous excess alcohol consumption, two with 
peripartum presentation, one with previous myocarditis, 
and one with hyperthyroidism. Of these patients, three 
(38%) met the primary endpoint, including two with 
previous excess alcohol consumption and one with 
peripartum presentation. Among these eight patients, 
mean LVEF at enrolment was 59% (SD 6·1) and the 
mean LVEF at follow-up was 55% (7·7; mean difference 
–4·6% [95% CI –13·1 to 3·8]; p=0·2333).
16 (32%) patients (nine in the treatment withdrawal 
group, seven in the crossover phase) completed treatment 
withdrawal, remained asymptomatic, and either finished 
the study with LVEF in the normal range or had a 3% or 
lower absolute reduction in LVEF (the expected interstudy 
variability16) or an increase in LVEF. The characteristics 
of these patients are included in the appendix.
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first 
prospective randomised trial to investigate withdrawal of 
heart failure treatment in patients deemed to have 
recovered dilated cardiomyopathy. In this pilot study, 
treatment was withdrawn successfully in only 50% of 
patients, while 40% had a relapse of their dilated 
cardiomyopathy within 6 months. Potentially, more 
patients might have relapsed with a longer duration of 
treatment withdrawal. This finding suggests that, for 
many patients, improvement in cardiac function 
following treatment does not reflect full and sustained 
recovery but rather reflects remission, which requires at 
least some treatment to be maintained. Withdrawal of 
treatment should therefore not be attempted routinely in 
these patients. Further research should aim to identify 
variables that discriminate remission from permanent 
recovery. This research could enable safe withdrawal of 
treatment in some subgroups. Given the speed of 
deterioration, with most patients relapsing within 
8 weeks of their last medication, these findings also 
provide guidance about how to monitor patients if 
treatment withdrawal is attempted, either at the patient’s 
request, because of side-effects, or because the patient is 
considering pregnancy.
Secondary analyses of the randomised groups showed 
worsening KCCQ scores, a substantial reduction in 
LVEF, and non-significant increases in NT-pro-BNP and 
LV volumes. These findings were supported by 
the non-randomised comparison of baseline and follow-
up variables among patients who had treatment 
withdrawal. Therefore, deterioration in LVEF after 
treatment withdrawal is not simply an imaging artifact 
but reflects disease recurrence. Analyses of patients who 
had withdrawal but did not meet the primary endpoint 
showed that these patients also had an overall reduction 
in LVEF. Our data also show that deterioration in LVEF 
often predated a rise in natriuretic peptides. Reproducible 
imaging, such as MRI, therefore appears to be important 
if withdrawal is considered under certain circumstances.
Patient safety was a priority. To identify those with 
the greatest degree of recovery, we only included 
asymptomatic patients with normal LV volumes and 
LVEF greater than 50% and excluded patients with clearly 
elevated plasma concentrations of NT-pro-BNP. Partici-
pants were monitored closely and treatment was restarted 
as soon as any criteria for the endpoint were met or if

there was another reason to resume treat 
ment, such as 
atrial fibrillation. The absence of major adverse 
cardiovascular events and unplanned hospital admissions 
for heart failure reflects the early detection of deterior-
ation and restarting of medications before decom-
pensation. It would have been unethical to wait until 
decompensation was clinically overt after detecting 
deteriorating cardiac function before reinstating treat-
ment. We focused on patients with dilated cardio-
myopathy as these patients are most likely to recover. 
Our data should be extrapolated with caution to patients 
with recovered left ventricular function secondary to 
ischaemic heart disease or hypertension. In ischaemic 
heart disease, ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers can be 
given to reduce further coronary events as well as 
morbidity and mortality related to heart failure. The same 
treatment is also given to control blood pressure in 
patients with hypertensive disease. Patients with recovered 
dilated cardiomyopathy also have a low prevalence of 
other comorbidities that might require pharmacological 
therapy, as indicated by our cohort and previous studies.3
Previous studies examining treatment withdrawal have 
been done in heterogeneous populations. Early studies 
were done in patients with reduced LVEF and symptoms 
of heart failure, most of whom had ischaemic heart 
disease.17–20 More contemporary studies in patients with 
dilated cardiomyopathy have been retrospective and done 
in poorly characterised populations, providing conflicting 
results.21,22 Our trial therefore provides the first prospective 
information about the risks of withdrawing treatment in 
patients with recovered dilated cardiomyopathy.
Moon and colleagues21 retrospectively investigated 
42 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy whose LVEF had 
improved to greater than 40%. Seven patients dis-
continued treatment, five of whom subsequently had a 
reduction in LVEF at a median follow-up of 32 months. 
However, most patients who deteriorated had LVEF 
less than 50% and LV dilatation. Conversely, Amos 
and colleagues22 studied 22 patients with peripartum 
cardiomyopathy whose LVEF had improved to greater 
than 50%. Ten subsequently stopped either an ACE 
inhibitor or beta-blocker and five stopped both medi-
cations. None of the patients had a deterioration in LVEF 
over a median follow-up of 29 months. Differences in 
outcome might be related to the cause of dilated 
cardiomyopathy, but it is becoming increasingly clear 
that overlap exists between what have traditionally been 
viewed as separate acquired and genetic conditions.23,24 
For example, a common genetic predisposition appears 
to exist for many patients with idiopathic and peripartum 
dilated cardiomyopathy.23 Although identification of a 
trigger might improve the prediction of outcome, triggers 
can occur many years before presentation and their 
significance at the time of diagnosis is often unclear. 
Because of the overlap between causes, the absence of 
data about any subgroup and to produce a sample that 
was representative of the real-world population, we chose 
to include all causes of dilated cardiomyopathy. Similar 
to registries, most patients in this trial were labelled as 
having idiopathic disease.25 Considering the complexity 
of defining the cause, it is not surprising that we found 
no association between the perceived cause and relapse 
in this trial, although the sample size was not large 
enough to detect more subtle associations.
Being able to distinguish between patients who 
have complete recovery as opposed to remission is an

important goal. Traditional practice has focused on the 
use of LVEF and LV volumes to grade recovery. However, 
within this small trial these variables were poor at 
predicting relapse. Whether the rate of relapse differs 
according to sex and age is unclear and deserves further 
work. It would be reasonable to believe that patients with 
genetic disease would be at increased risk of relapse. 
However, the relapse rate was not clearly greater in those 
with familial disease or a truncating variant in TTN. 
Previous reports have shown the potential for reverse 
remodelling in patients with a truncating variant in 
TTN,15,26 which is consistent with the high prevalence of a 
truncating variant in TTN in our cohort. Imaging and 
circulating biomarkers offer hope for improving disease 
characterisation. Global radial strain and NT-pro-BNP 
concentration were associated with the risk of relapse in 
exploratory analyses in this small sample. Whether these 
analyses are reproducible and able to reliably distinguish 
between recovery and remission requires further work. 
Identification of multiple characteristics that reflect 
different aspects of myocyte function might be needed.
Although this study is, to our knowledge, the only and 
therefore largest randomised trial investigating treatment 
withdrawal for recovered dilated cardio 
myopathy, the 
power to examine the association between baseline 
characteristics and relapse was restricted by the number 
of participants. The study might also have been too small 
to identify differences in variables such as NT-pro-BNP, 
which appeared to lag behind the reduction in LVEF. 
Although there were differences in some baseline 
characteristics between groups, these were small in 
absolute numbers and none of these variables was 
associated with the primary outcome. The single-arm 
crossover phase adds support for a consistent effect size 
across the entire population. The study was done in a 
single centre. Although some single-centre studies might 
be susceptible to selection bias, patients in this study 
were recruited from referral sites covering a large, diverse 
population. The baseline characteristics suggest that the 
cohort encompassed the heterogeneity of patients with 
dilated cardiomyopathy. A minimum time with LV 
dysfunction before recovery was not specified. However, 
diagnosis of dilated cardio 
myopathy was confirmed by 
experienced clinicians and fulfilled diagnostic criteria.
Although imaging and laboratory investigations were 
masked to the assigned group to minimise bias in 
objective measures, patients and clinicians knew to 
which group patients were assigned. Patients might have 
been biased in favour of treatment withdrawal and 
attributed side-effects to medications they did not wish to 
take or denied the presence of mild symptoms. It is also 
possible that treatment withdrawal provoked anxiety. 
These possibilities should be considered when inter- 
preting the patient-reported deterioration in symptoms. 
Patients in the treatment withdrawal group also 
underwent more frequent follow-up than did those in the 
continued treatment group. Although this aspect of the 
study design could be a source of bias, only two of 
20 events were detected, without development of 
symptoms, at visits before 16 weeks. We attempted to 
withdraw all treatment for heart failure. Many patients 
had already stopped diuretics. No patients were taking 
angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors as almost all 
were diagnosed before introduction of these drugs and 
showed favourable response to previous conventional 
treatment.27
The rise in heart rate associated with treatment with-
drawal, which was most marked in those who relapsed, 
suggests that the withdrawal of beta-blockers might be 
an important factor. However, one patient not on a beta-
blocker at baseline relapsed following treatment 
withdrawal. Heart rate is closely linked to prognosis in 
patients with heart failure and sinus rhythm.28,29 Whether 
the ongoing benefit of beta-blockers in this population is 
solely related to heart rate suppression deserves further 
consideration. Future work should explore which 
component of treatment is most important in preventing 
relapse. The impact of a change in cardiac function 
following treatment withdrawal on future compliance 
with medication is another worthwhile topic.
In conclusion, in this pilot study, withdrawal of 
pharmacological heart failure treatment in patients with 
recovered dilated cardiomyopathy was associated with 
relapse in 40% of cases. This finding suggests that 
complete withdrawal of treatment should not usually be 
attempted in such patients. Future work could identify 
patient subgroups who have permanent recovery of 
myocardial function for whom withdrawal is safe or for 
whom only some medications need to be continued in 
the long term.
