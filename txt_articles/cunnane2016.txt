Brain glucose uptake is impaired in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). A key question is whether cognitive decline can be
delayed if this brain energy defect is at least partly corrected or bypassed early in the disease. The principal ketones
(also called ketone bodies), �-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, are the brain’s main physiological alternative fuel
to glucose. Three studies in mild-to-moderate AD have shown that, unlike with glucose, brain ketone uptake is not
different from that in healthy age-matched controls. Published clinical trials demonstrate that increasing ketone
availability to the brain via moderate nutritional ketosis has a modest beneficial effect on cognitive outcomes in mild-
to-moderate AD and in mild cognitive impairment. Nutritional ketosis can be safely achieved by a high-fat ketogenic
diet, by supplements providing 20–70 g/day of medium-chain triglycerides containing the eight- and ten-carbon fatty
acids octanoate and decanoate, or by ketone esters. Given the acute dependence of the brain on its energy supply,
it seems reasonable that the development of therapeutic strategies aimed at AD mandates consideration of how the
underlying problem of deteriorating brain fuel supply can be corrected or delayed.

Introduction
The adult brain requires a disproportionately large
energy supply; while it represents about 2% of body
weight, it consumes about 20–23% of whole-body
energy requirements, mostly in the form of glu-
cose. It is now well established that both uptake
and metabolism of glucose by the brain deteriorate
in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). There is a particular
pattern of regional brain glucose hypometabolism
in AD affecting the parietal and temporal cortices,
where the glucose deficit is on the order of 20–
25% compared to age-matched, cognitively normal
controls.1 Because of a loss of synapses and neuronal
dysfunction and death in AD,2 the deficit in brain
glucose utilization has generally been interpreted
to be a consequence of AD (e.g., fewer functioning
neurons decreases the need for glucose). This per-
spective is indeed logical but does not account
for multiple examples of conditions in which
regional brain glucose hypometabolism is present
in presymptomatic individuals at risk of AD (i.e.,
before the clinical (cognitive) onset of the disease).
There are several clear examples in which enhanced
genetic or lifestyle-based risk of AD causes lower
brain glucose uptake long before the onset of cog-
nitive symptoms.
Glucose is the brain’s predominant fuel but,
like other organs, the brain has a back-up fuel
for occasions when glucose supply is insufficient,
for example, during fasting, starvation, strenuous
exercise, or malnutrition. Unlike other organs
for which free fatty acids replace insufficient
availability of glucose, the brain uses ketones

(also known as ketone bodies) as the only
significant back-up fuel for glucose. The two
ketones that replace glucose for the brain are
�-hydroxybutyrate
(�-HB)
and
acetoacetate
(AcAc). They are normally present in plasma in
a ratio of 2:1–3:1 in favor of �-HB, but it is only
AcAc that is �-oxidized in mitochondria; therefore,
�-HB must be converted to AcAc before being
metabolized. The third ketone, acetone, is a volatile
decarboxylation product of AcAc, the excretion of
which on the breath correlates well with plasma
ketone levels.3
We discuss here how brain glucose hypo-
metabolism could not only be a consequence of AD
but could also be contributing to the risk of AD
presymptomatically. We also compare findings on
the problem of deteriorating brain glucose uptake to
recentfindingsonbrainketoneuptakeincognitively
healthy older people and in AD, and make reference
to the emerging literature on the therapeutic poten-
tial of ketogenic supplements or diets in AD. This
review complements recently published reviews on
changing brain energy metabolism.4,5 Moreover, it
extends the discussions in these reviews by provid-
ing more information about the differences between
brain glucose and ketone uptake in AD, as well as
proposing a therapeutic objective for the dose of
ketogenic treatments that could be expected to have
therapeutic benefit in AD.
Presymptomatic brain glucose
hypometabolism contributing
to the onset of AD
Carriers of the presenilin 1 mutation are at the high-
est risk of AD.6–8 Carriers of the apolipoprotein E4
allele and persons with a family history of AD, espe-
cially on the maternal side, are also at increased risk
of AD,9–12 although their risk is still relatively low
compared to presenilin 1 carriers. Type 2 diabetes
and its associated insulin resistance rank among the
most important of the nongenetic or predominantly
lifestyle-based risk factors for AD. In these three
situations, presymptomatic regional brain glucose
hypometabolism on the order of 15% is clearly
present despite results on cognitive batteries being
normal (Table 1). Glucose hypometabolism in those
at risk of diabetes is most frequently, but not exclu-
sively, observed in the frontal cortex and, in certain
cases, can be observed at ages as young as 24 years.13
We interpret these data (Table 1) to indicate that
presymptomatic brain glucose hypometabolism can
be present long before the threshold of cognitive
symptoms of AD and could therefore potentially

be contributing to the development and/or pro-
gression of the cognitive decline associated with
AD. A neuropathological link has not yet been
convincingly demonstrated in humans, but it is
clearly the case in amyloid precursor protein (APP)
transgenic mouse models of AD, in which various
experimental approaches to diminishing brain glu-
cose supply all drive amyloid beta overproduction.14
Nevertheless, the pattern of regional brain glucose
hypometabolism varies across these different condi-
tions;therefore,itremainsspeculativeastohowthey
could contribute to AD. We also note that although
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is now widely
recognized as a prodromal state to AD and displays
regional brain glucose hypometabolism, objective
evidence for cognitive deficits is already present in
MCI; we have therefore excluded it from Table 1 as
an example of a presymptomatic condition to AD.
Aging is also a significant risk factor for AD.
We and other researchers have used positron emis-
sion tomography (PET) with the glucose analogue
and radiotracer 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) to
study brain energy metabolism in cognitively nor-
mal older persons. Using quantitative PET-FDG,
we have shown that in cognitively normal peo-
ple averaging 72 years, the cerebral metabolic
rate of glucose (CMRg) in the superior frontal
cortex is approximately 35 ± 5 instead of the
40 ± 7 mmol/100 g/min as seen in young adults
(i.e., the glucose uptake deficit in this brain region
is on the order of 12–15%).15–17 CMRg did not dif-
fer significantly between young and older adults in
either white or gray matter as a whole, nor did it dif-
fer in the temporal or parietal cortices where CMRg
noticeably decreases in AD. Lower CMRg present
mostly, if not exclusively, in the frontal cortex of
cognitively normal older people has been previously
reported.1,18 Thus, lower CMRg in the temporal and
parietal cortices in AD is a fundamentally different
situationthanlowerCMRginthefrontalcortexdur-
ing cognitively normal aging (but the former may
arise from or be related to the latter). Widespread
cortical thinning and regional brain atrophy are also
present in older people with normal cognition;17
therefore, although lower frontal CMRg can clearly
be presymptomatic in relation to aging-associated
cognitive decline, it is by no means the only or even
the quantitatively most significant change occurring
in the brain during aging.
These observations suggest that the widespread
perception that brain glucose hypometabolism is

deterioration and neuronal dysfunction, thereby increasing the
risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Controlled clinical trials with

uniquely a consequence of synaptic dysfunction
and neuronal failure or death associated with aging
needs to be reevaluated. Indeed, this regional brain
glucose hypometabolism can be present in young
adults in their 20s.13 We suggest that a vicious cycle
can gradually develop in which latent presymp-
tomatic brain glucose hypometabolism can lead
to chronic brain energy deprivation, deteriorating
neuronal function, further decline in demand for
glucose, and further cognitive decline (Fig. 1).1
The presence of presymptomatic brain glucose
hypometabolism does not necessarily make it the
primary cause of AD or indicate that neuronal func-
tion is necessarily still normal, nor even that glucose
hypometabolism is the first abnormality detectable
in those at risk of AD. Nevertheless, cognitive out-
comes suggest that the brains of some older peo-
ple can resist inadequate brain glucose supply for
a considerable time.15,17 Knowing that brain glu-
cose hypometabolism can be present in people at
risk of AD but before the onset of measurable clini-
cal (cognitive) deficits has implications for potential
therapeutic strategies.1,19–21
Ketones: the brain’s physiological
alternative fuel to glucose
The now classic studies by Owen et al.22 and Drenick
et al.23 demonstrated that ketones are the main

 Cunnane et al.
Brain glucose and ketone uptake in Alzheimer’s disease
reserve fuel for the brain when glucose supply is
severely compromised by medically supervised star-
vation lasting 40 or even 60 days, respectively. The
liver can produce ketones at a rate of 100–150
g/day,24,25 which is sufficient to meet the brain’s
ketone utilization during starvation. The energy
cost to the liver of producing ketones is supplied
by gluconeogenesis (mostly in the kidney), the rate
of which parallels and may eventually limit maxi-
mum achievable ketone production.24,26
In adults, ketogenesis is principally from long-
chain fatty acids (mostly 16 and 18 carbons) stored
in adipose tissue, the release of which is con-
trolled by insulin. The branched-chain amino acids,
valine, isoleucine, and leucine, are also ketogenic,
with much of the amino acid catabolism occurring
in skeletal muscle. During fasting, blood glucose
and insulin decrease, which releases the inhibition
on lipolysis in adipose tissue, permitting increased
release of free fatty acids. The increase in plasma free
fatty acids helps meet the need for an alternative fuel
to glucose for most organs with the notable excep-
tion of the brain. The increased supply of free fatty
acids entering the liver leads to fatty acid beta oxi-
dation and ketogenesis due to condensation of pairs
of acetyl CoA units as their availability exceeds their
utilization by the tricarboxylic acid cycle.27 Ketones
produced by the liver cannot be catabolized by the
liver and are released into the circulation. As far as
is known, all organs can potentially use ketones as
fuel but, in practice, as fasting or starvation becomes
prolonged, skeletal muscle consumes progressively
less ketones, and they are used principally by the
brain.18
Insulin sensitivity is an important parameter in
ketogenesis because it controls the rise and fall of
plasma glucose and free fatty acids. Indeed, con-
ditions involving decreased insulin sensitivity (e.g.,
insulin resistance) impair tissue glucose uptake and
become associated with a vicious cycle of hyper-
glycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and an eventual trend
toward type 2 diabetes, which is a major risk fac-
tor for AD.28,29 Postprandial hyperinsulinemia nor-
mally inhibits fatty acid release from adipose tissue
and, hence, ketogenesis, but only as long as insulin
sensitivityandtissueglucoseuptakearenormal(i.e.,
if insulin returns to baseline 2–3 h postprandially).
Sedentary lifestyles and excessive intake of simple
sugars commonly lead to slower insulin clearance
and chronic hyperinsulinemia, which compromise
not only tissue glucose metabolism but also keto-
genesis and ketone catabolism.30 Hyperinsulinemia
therefore puts the aging brain in double jeopardy, in
partbecausethebrainisthenacquiring/utilizingless
glucose but also because less of the main alternative
fuel, ketones, is being produced.1,31,32
Regional brain ketone uptake in early AD
We have compared brain glucose (FDG) and ketone
(11C–AcAc) uptake using PET in early AD.33 Our
aim was threefold—to verify earlier reports that
AD patients had normal ketone but low brain glu-
cose uptake,34 to assess brain fuel metabolism in
early AD rather than in the more advanced stages
previously reported,35 and to quantify the regional
pattern of brain uptake of both fuels in AD under
postprandial conditions. As expected, global brain
FDG uptake was 14% lower in early AD patients
compared to cognitively normal age-matched con-
trols. This global glucose deficit was primarily con-
fined to the parietal cortex, posterior cingulate, and
thalamus.33 However, neither net 11C–AcAc uptake
nor the rate constant for AcAc uptake were signif-
icantly different in the brain as a whole or in any
brain region in AD versus controls.33 The kinet-
ics of ketone PET tracer metabolism in the brain
(whether 11C–AcAc or 11C–�-HB36) suggest a one-
compartment model in which there is essentially
no tissue ketone accumulation because utilization
matches uptake. Hence, plasma AcAc or �-HB are
highly positively correlated to their respective uti-
lization by the brain. Furthermore, the slope of this
relationship does not appear to differ between con-
trols and early AD,33 at least when plasma ketones

energy requirements (Fig. 2). These results confirm
the earlier studies of both Lying-Tunell et al.35 and
Ogawa et al.34 11C–AcAc is chemically identical to
AcAc produced by the body; therefore, unlike with
FDG, which is taken up by the plasma membrane
but not metabolized beyond hexokinase, it is pos-
sible to interpret our results as showing that both
brain uptake and metabolism of ketones were nor-
mal in early AD. Ketone uptake into the brain occurs
through monocarboxylate transporters, which are
distinct from glucose transporters. Hence, brain
cells in AD still have functional ketone uptake
and metabolism and so the problem with glucose
uptake/metabolism appears to be specific to glu-
cose. Like glucose, ketones function as more than

at plasma �-HB values around 0.1 mM, ketones supply over 5%
of brain energy; at 1 mM �-HB, they supply about 10–15%; at
5–7 mM �-HB, 50–65%; and at over 7–8 mM �-HB, over 75%
of brain energy consumption. For a given plasma AcAc concen-
tration, AcAc is taken up by the brain more rapidly than �-HB,

just cellular fuels, so the latter may be beneficial for
the AD brain because of effects other than replacing
glucose as a fuel, including supporting glutamater-
gic function.4,37
Like glucose, ketones generate ATP by oxida-
tive phosphorylation in mitochondria. However,
unlike glucose—which can also be metabolized
by aerobic glycolysis producing lactate, which, in
turn, also generates some ATP in the cytosol—
ketones generate ATP uniquely via oxidative phos-
phorylation. Normal brain ketone metabolism in
early AD indirectly supports the speculation that
oxidative phosphorylation must still be normal
in early AD,38 because otherwise normal ketone
catabolism could not be maintained. These obser-
vations provide a rationale for the concept that the
fuel hypometabolism in the AD brain is specific to
glucose.Hence,providingtheagingbrainwithmore
ketones may help it overcome the creeping deficit
in glucose uptake and metabolism, thereby delay-
ing brain energy exhaustion and decreasing the risk
of AD (Fig. 1).
Ketogenesis from medium-chain
triglycerides: dose–response relationship
Fasting or very low carbohydrate intake induces
ketosis because long-chain fatty acids are beta oxi-
dized by the liver. In adults, most dietary and
hence most adipose tissue long-chain fatty acids
are of 16 or 18 carbons in length. However, breast
milk contains medium-chain fatty acids (i.e., fatty
acids of 6–12 carbons). Without resorting to fast-
ing or starvation, breastfed infants achieve rela-
tively sustained but mild ketosis by metabolizing
medium-chain fatty acids as they are provided from
breastmilk.39 Medium-chain fatty acids are mostly
absorbed through the portal vein, hence gaining
direct access to the liver without first going through
the peripheral circulation. They are also beta oxi-
dized without needing to be activated by carnitine,
the net result of which is more rapid ketogene-
sis from medium-chain than from long-chain fatty
acids.
With a couple of exceptions, there is normally no
opportunity to consume medium-chain fatty acids
from the diet once breastfeeding has been termi-
nated. The exceptions are coconut oil and palm
kernel oil, in which the most ketogenic medium-
chain fatty acids, octanoic (caprylic) and decanoic
(capric), make up approximately 9% and 10% of
the fatty acids, respectively. The fraction of these oils
that contain medium-chain fatty acids can be con-
centrated, resulting in the generic ketogenic product
medium-chain triglyceride (MCT).39,40 The ratio of
these two ketogenic fatty acids and their propor-
tion of the total can vary widely from one MCT
product to another. Notwithstanding the generic
nature of MCTs and different study designs to
assess their metabolism, there is a remarkably strong
positive correlation between the maximal plasma
ketone (�-HB) level achieved and the oral dose
of MCTs over a range of 10–70 g (R2 = 0.97;
P < 0.0001). Hence, a 30-g oral dose of MCTs
results in a maximal plasma �-HB of approximately

0.5 mM, and a 70-g dose raises plasma �-HB
to approximately 1.0 mM (Fig. 3). These dose–
response studies show similar results whether sin-
gle or multiple doses of MCTs are given, probably
because of rapid plasma ketone clearance.
Healthy older people metabolize ketones to CO2
at the same rate as younger adults.40 Indeed, hyper-
ketonemiaafter18hoffastingmayactuallybesome-
what higher in the seventh to eighth decade of life
compared to younger adults.41 Hence, the capacity
to produce and use ketones may actually be increas-
ing somewhat during healthy aging. These studies
didnotdistinguishbetweenketoneutilizationbythe
brain versus other organs, but our brain ketone PET
studies confirm that the brain has similar ketone
uptake and utilization in healthy older compared to
younger persons15 (Fig. 2).
Experimental hyperketonemia in
conditions of acute or chronic
cognitive deficit
Oral MCTs have been shown to improve cognitive
outcomes during controlled experimental hypo-
glycemia caused by insulin infusion.42 The very
high-fat ketogenic diet has been reported to have
a similar beneficial effect on cognitive and cardio-
vascular outcomes in MCI, the prodromal state to
AD.43 These reports complement the studies show-
ing that autonomic and neurological symptoms of
severe experimental hypoglycemia as low as 0.5 mM
inducedbyinsulininfusioncanbeavoidedbyketone
infusion44,45 or prolonged medically supervised
starvation.18 They demonstrate that ketones can
sustain normal brain function even when plasma
glucose is severely reduced. Several products based
on MCTs are now available on the market or by
prescription in the United States and Europe. The
arrival of these products was greatly facilitated by
reports that MCTs had beneficial effects on cogni-
tive outcomes in mild-to-moderate AD after a sin-
gle dose46 or with regular consumption over several
months.47
AcAc and �-HB can also be administered orally
or by infusion as salts or esters,48–50 with the esters
being more practical for long-term use because they
avoid the issues of cation overload. The safety of a
�-HB monoester50 and its utility in improving some
aspects of cognitive function in a single case history
of early-onset AD have recently been reported.51
The results of these clinical studies are still prelim-
inary but they support the hypothesis that a brain
glucose deficit could be contributing to impaired
cognition associated with aging and that this brain
fuel deficit can at least in part be bypassed by a
source of ketones, whether it be a ketogenic sup-
plement containing MCTs, a ketone ester, or a very
high-fat ketogenic diet.
Safety of medium-chain triglycerides
MCTs in doses up to 1 g/kg/day have a robust safety
record in all species studied, including humans.52,53
Nevertheless, MCTs can have secondary side effects
involving gastrointestinal distress, an issue that can
be partially mitigated by gradual dose titration.
MCTs are saturated fats and, as such, have long been
assumed to increase cardiovascular risk factors and
body weight. However, treatment for 30 days with
30 g/day of MCTs does not adversely affect body
weight, body fat content, or body mass index, nor
does it affect serum glucose, insulin, triglycerides,
cholesterol, or free fatty acids.54
Perspectives and challenges requiring
further work
We propose that AD is, in part, a product of
chronic gradual brain energy starvation or exhaus-
tion due specifically to an increasing deficit in
brain glucose uptake and metabolism. In addi-
tion to the fuel deficit in the brain, neuroin-
flammation mediated by free radical damage may
be exacerbated by impaired brain glucose uptake
because glucose normally contributes to the syn-
thesis of antioxidants via the pentose phosphate

pathway.55,56 Owing to mild insulin resistance
associated with aging,57,58 replacement of declining
glucose transport into the brain by ketones pro-
duced endogenously from fatty acids in adipose tis-
sue is also inefficient.
Several clinical studies suggest that the early
stages of AD may be amenable to nutritional treat-
ments that raise plasma ketones.46,47 Our PET
results showing normal brain ketone uptake early
in AD but low brain glucose uptake also support
the plausibility of using a “keto-neurotherapeutic”
strategy in early AD. The broadly similar neurologi-
cal/cognitive benefit of a very high-fat ketogenic diet
containing no MCTs,43 or a typical diet containing
over 50% carbohydrate to which MCTs or ketone
esters are added,51 suggests that the improvement
in cognition is related to a common denomina-
tor of raised plasma ketones, which bypass chron-
ically impaired glucose uptake and utilization by
the AD brain. However, this is still speculative; to
date, no study has provided a direct mechanism
by which MCTs or ketones could improve cog-
nitive outcomes. Moderate ketosis may stimulate
mitochondrial biogenesis,59 which may also help
improve oxidative phosphorylation and ATP gener-
ation in the brain. It has not yet been established
whether certain MCTs (e.g., octanoate, decanoate,
or others) are more effective for ketogenesis than
others. Octanoic acid can be taken up and con-
sumed as a fuel by the brain;60,61 therefore, it may
have direct effects on brain function, including but
not limited to conversion to ketones by astrocytes.62
Ketones do not contribute to anaplerosis (replace-
ment of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates), so
whether the benefit of prolonged ketosis could be
self-limiting remains to be seen.63,64 Specific pro-
cesses in the brain may need glycolysis-derived ATP
but this remains quite controversial,65–67 and if con-
firmed, would be a function that glucose, but not
ketones, could support.
Several clinical trials registered on ClinicalTri-
als.gov are underway that combine either a keto-
genic supplement or diet with cognitive evaluation
and should produce results over the next 2–3 years.
These studies should be able to shed further light
on the potential utility of keto-therapeutics in neu-
rodegenerative diseases such as AD.
