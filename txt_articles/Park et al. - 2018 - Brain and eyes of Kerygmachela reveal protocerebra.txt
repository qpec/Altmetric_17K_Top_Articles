Recent discoveries of fossil nervous tissue in Cambrian fossils have allowed researchers to
trace the origin and evolution of the complex arthropod head and brain based on stem groups
close to the origin of the clade, rather than on extant, highly derived members. Here we show
that Kerygmachela from Sirius Passet, North Greenland, a primitive stem-group euarthropod,
exhibits a diminutive (protocerebral) brain that innervates both the eyes and frontal
appendages. It has been surmised, based on developmental evidence, that the ancestor of
vertebrates and arthropods had a tripartite brain, which is refuted by the fossil evidence
presented here. Furthermore, based on the discovery of eyes in Kerygmachela, we suggest
that the complex compound eyes in arthropods evolved from simple ocelli, present in ony-
chophorans and tardigrades, rather than through the incorporation of a set of modified limbs.

esolving the evolutionary origin of the frontal appendages
and eyes of stem-group euarthropods is crucial for eluci-
dating the segmental affinity of the head of arthropods1,2.
The arthropod brain is composed of three distinct segments (tri-
tocerebral) that innervate corresponding appendages. The affinity
and homology of arthropod appendages is essential to the iden-
tification of which appendage is innervated by which brain seg-
ment. Among these, the origin of the labrum has been much
debated3–5. The recent discovery of an anomalocaridid with the
brain preserved suggests a protocerebral innervation of the frontal
appendages in stem-group euarthropods, and a homology between
the frontal appendage and the labrum1; however, this interpreta-
tion remains contested6,7. Furthermore, it has recently been pro-
posed that a subdivision of the protocerebrum into prosocerebrum
and
archicerebrum
occurred
through
the
fusion
of
two
appendage-bearing segments, in which the eyes are modified
appendages of the archicerebral segment2,3,8.
Kerygmachela kierkegaardi9 is known only from the Buen For-
mation (Cambrian Stage 3) of Sirius Passet, North Greenland10.
This relatively rare, gilled lobopod exhibits some anomalocaridid-
like features, such as the trunk “gills”9,10, diverticulae11, and its
frontal appendages9,10. Nevertheless, its overall anatomy is more
plesiomorphic, lacking clear arthrodization/arthropodization and
instead exhibiting a softer, annulated external cuticula compar-
able to onychophorans and tardigrades along with the diverse
host of Cambrian lobopodians. Therefore, this taxon may provide
crucial evidence for understanding early character evolution in
the panarthropod head. To date, knowledge of its morphology
has been based on specimens collected from weathered screes.
However, for this study, unweathered fossils of Kerygmachela
were collected from the rock exposure of the Buen Formation in
Sirius Passet, and these specimens include structures preserved as
carbonaceous reflective films in the head. These structures con-
form to eyes and nervous tissue in their anatomy and preserva-
tion mode. The findings shed light on the ancestral condition of
the panarthropod brain and the origin of complex arthropod
compound eyes. The new material, furthermore, provides novel
information on the overall anatomy of Kerygmachela.

 (Fig. 1a–e; Supplementary Fig. 1a–c). Accordingly, the position of
the anteriorly facing mouth is not terminal10, but is situated
ventrally below the anterior lobe, between a pair of structures
termed as rostral spines10 (Figs. 1e, 2h; Supplementary Fig. 1c).
At the base of the frontal appendages are structures interpreted as
eyes, based on both their position and preservation, with dis-
tinctive relief and high reflectivity similar to the preservation of
eyes in arthropods from the Burgess Shale (see Fig. 2 in ref.12).
Their outline is reminiscent of the kidney- or sickle-shaped eye
lobes of trilobites (Figs. 1c–e, 3a, Supplementary Figs 2b–d, 8a–e).
We interpret the eyes as situated ventrolaterally, because they are
best delineated in ventral specimens where mouth structures and
rostral spines are most visible (Fig. 1d,e; Supplementary Figs 1a–c,
2, 8a–e). In dorsal specimens, the epidermal annulations continue
over the eye lobes (Supplementary Fig. 1f, i). The anterior half of
the eye is located under the posterior part of the frontal appen-
dages (Fig. 1d,e; Supplementary Figs 2c–d, 8a–e). The presence of
relatively marked relief in the eyes (Fig. 1d; Supplementary
Figs 2b, 8b,d) contrasts with Cambrian lobopodians that show a
single or a few clustered visual units lacking such elevation13,14.
This indicates that there was a visual surface formed by the
contiguous arrangement of visual units, suggesting that the visual
structures seen in K. kierkegaardi represent primitive compound
eyes, further corroborated by their large size. Their morphology
does not match camera eyes, which are globular. The irregular

 Supplementary Fig. 1c, f, i) suggests that they have been subject to
some post-mortem decay. The ventro-lateral position of the eyes
in Kerygmachela is remarkable, but not unique; the ocellus-like
eye of the Cambrian lobopodian Onychodictyon ferox was also
situated ventral to the antennae15. A pair of rostral spines flank
the mouth, attached just behind the mouth opening in MGUH
32048b (Fig. 1e). Sub-circular structures are present at the base,
which are likely to be apodemes (Supplementary Fig. 1c).
We interpret the anterior reflective patches, lacking any relief
and located between the frontal appendages as a centralized
nervous system (Figs. 1a,c, 2a,e; Supplementary Figs 1a, d, g).
These structures are similar to the nervous tissue described in the
anomalocaridid Lyrarapax unguispinus1 (Fig. 3a) and conform to
nervous tissue in their topology when compared with living
relatives. The nervous system is usually best observed when
mapping carbon distribution by wavelenth dispersive X-ray
spectrometry (WDS) (Figs. 1f, 2c,g; Supplementary Figs 2, 4–6).
MGUH 32049 (Fig. 2c) appears to be the best preserved,
reconciling evidence from the range of fossils available in which
some appear to be more decayed before taphonomic stabilization
(Fig. 2g; Supplementary Fig. 5d). The brain shape in this
specimen appears to be reminiscent of the anteriorly rounded
central brain neuropil in a eutardigrade embryo16 (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 10a, b). If the prominent carbon-rich area in the WDS
carbon map represents the central brain neuropil, the surround-
ing reflective area of the brain may be the trace of brain cells as
seen in tardigrades16. The taphonomic pathways leading to
nervous tissue preservation are still not fully understood. It has
been noted that nervous tissue decays rapidly17, but the relative
pace at which tissues decay is a poor proxy for their preservation
potential18. Certain lipids are common organic biomarkers due to
their stable molecular structure, and nervous tissues are lined by
lipid-rich
tissues,
which
may
explain
their
preservation
potential19,20.
The mouth opening, at the anterior end of a pharynx that is
usually mineralized in the fossils, could lie just posterior to the
brain (Supplementary Fig. 1a–c), but in the largest specimen, the
anterior margin of the mineralized pharynx is situated anterior to
the brain area (Fig. 1c–e), which might be due to decay
deformation. Unlike L. unguispinus, simple nervous tracts
without an associated ganglion are supplied from the lateral
margin of the brain to innervate the two frontal appendages
(Fig. 3a). The apparent bifurcation of the nervous tract for the
frontal appendages observed in MGUH 32053 probably supplied
a nerve to an anterior spine (Supplementary Fig. 1g, i). The
nervous tract extends almost to the tip of the frontal appendage,
and likely innervates the outermost and longest frontal process
(Supplementary Fig. 1a, c; Supplementary Fig. 3). There are
anterior neural projections from the brain into the anterior lobe
(Figs. 1a–e, 2, 3a; Supplementary Fig. 1). The relative size of the
anterior neural projection tends to be more developed in larger
specimens (Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. 1). Less conspicuous optic
nerves root at the lateral margin of the brain, indicating that the
brain is protocerebral (Figs. 1c,e, 2a,e,d,h, 3a; Supplementary
Fig. 1a, c, d, f, g, i). A pair of nerve cords (or connecting cords21)
is tentatively present in MGUH 32053 and MGUH 32050
(Fig. 2d,h; Supplementary Fig. 1g, i). In more derived arthropods,
the deutocerebrum innervates the second anteriormost appen-
dages. Due to its morphology and since
the first post-
protocerebral appendage is situated far behind the protocereb-
rum, it can be concluded that the brain of Kerygmachela is
unipartite.
Trunk region. The trunk had 11 pairs of flaps giving it an oval
outline with a single, unsegmented tail spine. Eleven rows of
tubercles are present in the axial region, corresponding to each set
of lateral flaps, with four tubercles present in each row. The
tubercles become more prominent posteriorly. The central two
tubercles are larger than the outer ones and become more widely
spaced posteriorly, eventually becoming almost superimposed on
the lateral ones in the distal region (Fig. 3b; Supplementary
Figs 5a–c, 6a–c, 8a–c, f–h, 9a–e). The lateral flaps appear suc-
cessively smaller rearward in the holotype10, but this is due to
their backwards-facing aspect in this specimen. In the new
material, the fourth and fifth pair of lateral flaps appear to be
largest, rendering an oval outline in dorsal view (Figs. 1a,b, 3b;
Supplementary Fig. 6a–c). Although the holotype of Ker-
ygmachela has a single long tail spine, the animal was interpreted
to have a pair of tail spines9,10. However, all new specimens in
this study show a single, long, medially attached, and unseg-
mented tail spine, when preserved (Fig. 1a,b; Supplementary
Figs 6a–c, 7, 8a–c, 9). The tail spine is almost as long as the body,
excluding the frontal appendages. There are derived stem-group
euarthropods with a single tail spine-like structure which might
be homologous; Schinderhannes bartelsi from the Devonian
Hunsrück Slate has a long terminal spine with a median keel22,
and Anomalocaris canadensis from the Burgess Shale has an
elongated “blade”23.
Discussion
The segmental origin of frontal appendages in stem-group
euarthropods is one of the key issues for solving the “arthropod
head problem”4, and identifying their innervation has been
regarded as a possible solution to this problem5. The frontal
appendages of stem-group euarthropods have been interpreted as
innervated from the protocerebrum, being homologous to the
labrum1,3,4, or the deutocerebrum, being homologous to anten-
nule or chelicera5,24,25. The frontal appendage nerves of the
anomalocaridid L. unguispinus have been interpreted as being
supplied from the protocerebrum, based on the pre-ocular posi-
tion of the innervation1. It has been argued, however, that the
relative position of the eyes and frontal appendages does not
necessarily reveal their segmental identity in dorso-ventrally
compressed fossils6, since in euarthropod development, deuto-
cerebral appendages may become displaced anteriorly3. The
presence of a unipartite, and hence protocerebral, brain in the
stem-euarthropod Kerygmachela, substantiates the suggested
homology between the stem-euarthropod frontal appendages and
the labrum of euarthropods1,3,4.
In contrast to L. unguispinus1, the more basal K. kierkegaardi
does not show any trace of ganglia within the frontal appendages
(Figs. 1, 2, 3a; Supplementary Fig. 1). This indicates that the pre-
protocerebral ganglion of L. unguispinus may have been an
autapomorphic feature, and that the frontal appendages are not
pre-protocerebral in origin.
Developmental studies have found a genetic subdivision of the
arthropod protocerebrum—six3/optix is expressed in the ante-
romedian area of the protocerebrum, while otx/otd is expressed in
the lateral regions26,27. This has led to the suggestion that the
ancestral arthropod brain was bipartite with a prosocerebrum
innervating the euarthropod labrum or the onychophoran
antennae, while the posterior archicerebrum originated from the
incorporation of a limb pair, modified into stalked eyes seen
primitively in euarthropods and their proximal stem groups, the
radiodontans2,3,8.
The plesiomorphic condition of visual structures in panar-
thropods has remained elusive due to the currently ambiguous
phylogenetic relationships of the Tardigrada, Onychophora, and
Cambrian lobopodians. Nevertheless, it can now be suggested
that the single or spaced-apart multiple sessile visual units of the

 “Cambrian lobopodian” grades13 evolved into the compound eyes
of Kerygmachela, from which the stalked compound eyes of
anomalocaridids28 and euarthropods2 arose (Fig. 4b).
Recognition of rather large-sickle-shaped eyes in Kerygmachela
contradicts the suggestion that the small, circular structures at the
root of the rostral spines represent eyes10. Rather, we draw
attention to the architectural resemblance between the buccal
apparatus of tardigrades and the rostral spines–pharynx complex
of Kerygmachela, which will require further scrutiny (Supple-
mentary Fig. 10c, d). If the tardigrade stylets are truly homo-
logous to the rostral spines of Kerygmachela, it would cast doubt
on the suggested protocerebral appendage origin of the tardigrade
stylets29.
The position of the anterior lobe in Kerygmachela is reminis-
cent of the anterior sclerite in more derived arthropods, which is a
non-appendicular exoskeletal structure containing protocerebral
frontal organs12, which may have arisen from a less sclerotized
structure as observed in Kerygmachela.
The frontal organs have been regarded as possible median
eyes12,30. The anterior neural projections in the anterior lobe of
Kerygmachela may have supplied neurons to possible dorsal
median visual units, and thus the dorsal median visual units could
have been used for anterodorsal vision supplementing the ven-
trolaterally positioned compound eyes.
The unipartite brain of Kerygmachela may thus prove essential
for inferring the brain condition of the last common ancestor
(LCA) of panarthropods. Although brain anatomy is hard to
distinguish even in extant animals, recent studies suggest that
tardigrades have a unipartite (protocerebral) brain16,29,31. The
onychophoran brain has been considered to be bipartite32, but
derived20. The presence of a unipartite brain, consisting of a
protocerebrum in the stem-group euarthropod Kerygmachela,
therefore, suggests that it represents the primitive panarthropod
condition along with tardigrades. In addition, recent paleonto-
logical evidence indicates that there are close architectural simi-
larities in circumoral structures between other ecdysozoans
(cycloneuralians)
and
basal
panarthropods33,34.
Since
all
cycloneuralians have a collar-shaped circumoral nerve ring with
anterior and posterior rings of neuronal somata, it is likely that
the LCA of panarthropods had a circumoral nerve ring, along
with a protocerebum (Fig. 4a). In this regard, the presence of a
nerve ring in a eutardigrade with an anteriorly facing terminal
mouth is particularly significant31 (Supplementary Fig. 10f),
which are absent in heterotardigrades (Supplementary Fig. 10g).
Indeed,
peribuccal
lamellae,
and
buccopharyngeal
teeth
(mucrones) in the eutardigrade mouth (Supplementary Fig. 10e)
are morphologically and topologically comparable to the conical
spines surrounding the mouth, and pharyngeal teeth of priapulid-
like cycloneuralians, respectively.
Inference of an ancestral condition based on living animals is
often hampered by convergent evolution among distant lineages,
representing parallel adaptations to changes in the biosphere and
evolutionary escalation. The discovery of the simple unipartite
brain in stem-group euarthropods corroborates the ancestral
simplicity of the panarthropod brain, and also suggests that the
complex neural concentrations, such as tripartite brains35,36 in
euarthropods and chordates, are the result of convergent
adaptations.
Methods
Material studied. Fifteen specimens of K. kierkegaardi were collected in situ from
the Buen Formation at the main locality in Sirius Passet, Nansen Land, North
Greenland during the expeditions in 2011, 2016, and 2017. The specimens are
preserved as thin reflective films, as in documented fossils of the other animals38–
40. The specimens are deposited in the Geological Museum, Natural History
Museum of Denmark, University of Copenhagen, prefixed with MGUH (MGUH
32048–32062). Fossils were mechanically prepared using an AUTOMEL Electric
Engraver of Dong Yang Electric Co.
Image acquisition. The fossils were photographed in the laboratory and sub-
merged in ethanol, with a Canon EOS 6D using a Canon EF 100 mm f/2.8 L IS
USM macro lens equipped with a polarizing filter (ELVA XS-Pro1 Digital CIR-PL
67 mm). High-angle polarized lighting was used to obtain the maximal reflective
image of the specimens. Low-angle (close to horizontal) lighting was also used from
various orientations to enhance recognition of low relief in the fossils. Images were
cropped, adjusted, and enhanced by means of brightness and contrast in Adobe

 Photoshop CS6. The raw images for polynomial texture mapping were acquired by
a self-crafted system permitting lighting from 50 different directions and a Canon
EOS 60D equipped with a Canon EF 100 mm f/2.8 USM macro lens. The 50 images
were taken for each white-coated specimen, which were together converted into a
PTM format file. The PTM file was then run in RTI Viewer software which is freely
downloadable at http://culturalheritageimaging.org/What_We_Offer/Downloads/,
in order to enhance surface details of the fossils.
X-ray elemental mapping. Fossils were gold coated using a Cressington 108 Auto
sputter coater with 40 mA for 60 s. X-ray elemental maps for C, Na, Mg, Al, P, S,
Cl, K, Ca, and Fe were obtained using the JEOL JXA-8530F field emission electron
microprobe at the Korea Polar Research Institute, equipped with five wavelength
dispersive X-ray spectrometers (WDS). We employed stage mapping with an
acceleration voltage of 20 kV, beam current of 100 nA, beam size of 5 μm, dwell
time of 10–20 ms, and step size of 10–25 μm. Secondary electron (SE) and back-
scattered electron (BSE) images were simultaneously obtained during the mapping.
Raw data of X-ray elemental maps, SE, and BSE were imported and processed for
brightness and contrast by ImageJ41. A red–green–blue color scheme in ImageJ was
applied to make a false color map.
Tardigrade treatment. Dactylobiotus sp., a member of the Eutardigrada was
collected near the King Sejong Station, at the King George Island, Antarctica
during the 2014–2015 field season by a KOPRI ecology team (led by Dr. Sanghee
Kim). Specimens were killed by hot water42, and fixed in glycerol43 with mounting
medium on microscope slides with 18 × 18 mm square coverslips44. DIC images
were taken with an AxioCam HRc camera mounted on a Zeiss Imager A2
microscope. For SEM images, samples were fixed in 5% formaldehyde overnight,
heated in a double boiler at ~70–80 ℃, and washed with distilled water three times.
Subsequently, dehydration was performed twice in series with ethanol of 50%, 60%,
70%, 80%, 90%, and 100%. Then, the samples were critical point dried and sputter
coated with gold. The SEM images were acquired using a JEOL JSM-6610 SEM.
The samples are deposited in the Korea Polar Research Institute, prefixed with
KOPRIF (KOPRIF50001, 50002).
