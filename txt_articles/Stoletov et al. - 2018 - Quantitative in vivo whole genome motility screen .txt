Metastasis is the most lethal aspect of cancer, yet current therapeutic strategies do not
target its key rate-limiting steps. We have previously shown that the entry of cancer cells into
the blood stream, or intravasation, is highly dependent upon in vivo cancer cell motility,
making it an attractive therapeutic target. To systemically identify genes required for tumor
cell motility in an in vivo tumor microenvironment, we established a novel quantitative in vivo
screening platform based on intravital imaging of human cancer metastasis in ex ovo avian
embryos. Utilizing this platform to screen a genome-wide shRNA library, we identified a panel
of novel genes whose function is required for productive cancer cell motility in vivo, and
whose expression is closely associated with metastatic risk in human cancers. The
RNAi-mediated inhibition of these gene targets resulted in a nearly total (>99.5%) block of
spontaneous cancer metastasis in vivo.

etastatic dissemination is the primary cause of cancer-
related deaths1–4. While surgical resection of primary
tumors in concert with systemic chemotherapy has
provided success in the treatment of localized cancers, metastatic
disease has proven remarkably resistant to modern targeted
therapies, rendering these cancers incurable. Indeed, to mitigate
the risk of future metastasis, many patients are subjected to highly
morbid treatment regimens that negatively impact quality of life5.
Therapies that specifically target the rate-limiting steps of meta-
static dissemination of tumor cells could significantly improve
cancer treatment by removing the threat of systemic disease and
decreasing our dependency on systemic therapies with detri-
mental side-effects1–4.
The process of metastasis is dependent on a tumor cell’s ability
to intravasate into the blood stream, disseminate to a distant site,
evade immune detection, survive, proliferate and subsequently
colonize a new microenvironment6. Previously, we have shown
that intravasation rates are highly dependent on in vivo tumor
cell motility. Furthermore, when motility is inhibited using a
migration-blocking antibody that targets tetraspanin CD151, both
cancer cell intravasation and distant metastasis are blocked3,7.
Given that the genes and signaling networks that drive in vivo
motility and intravasation are different from those required for
efficient primary tumor formation, we sought to develop an
in vivo approach to feasibly screen for genes required for motility,
and thus intravasation and metastasis8.
Previously, the identification of genes required for in vivo cell
motility has been impeded by the inherent difficulty in visualizing
the formation of metastatic lesions in vivo9,10. To address this, we
utilized a novel intravital imaging approach in shell-less, ex ovo
avian embryos to perform an shRNA screen for gene products
that regulate tumor cell motility in vivo11,12. Here, we describe
the discovery of novel genes that drive cancer cell motility and
metastasis in vivo. We show that targeting of these genes blocks
productive cancer cell invasion and inhibits spontaneous metas-
tasis in a mouse model of human cancer progression. The
expression of these genes positively correlates with progression of
several human cancers, highlighting their promise as therapeutic
targets.
Results
Visualizing cancer cell motility phenotypes in the avian
embryo. Upon intravenous injection into the avian embryo,
cancer cells disseminate throughout the vasculature. A substantial
fraction of these cancer cells arrest as single cells in the chor-
ioallantoic membrane (CAM), where they undergo extravasation
into the extravascular stroma and proliferate into invasive
metastatic colonies13. These colonies, each derived from a single
cancer cell, reach the size of ~1 mm2 (50−100 cells per colony)
over 4 days and can be easily visualized using intravital micro-
scopy (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). Because thousands
of individual metastatic colonies can be simultaneously visualized
in the CAM of a single embryo, it is feasible to screen large
libraries of genes using this approach. When highly motile cancer
cells such as the human head and neck HEp3 cell line are injected,
the resulting colonies adopt a diffuse “spread out” morphology
where the proliferating cells have migrated a significant distance
from the point of extravasation (Supplementary Fig. 1b). When
the in vivo motility of tumor cells is reduced, such as that
observed when using a CD151-specific migration-blocking anti-
body, metastatic colonies exhibit a highly compact morphology
that is easily distinguished from the highly motile phenotype3.
These compact metastatic lesions, comprised of tightly packed
cancer cells, can be readily excised from the surrounding tissue
and subjected to further analysis. We hypothesized that, as we
had seen with the targeting of CD151, the inhibition of genes
required for in vivo cell motility would lead to compact colony
phenotypes, thereby allowing us to utilize this approach to screen
for therapeutic targets of cell motility that would in turn impact
intravasation and metastasis.
Intravital imaging screen for genes required for productive
motility. To perform the screen, we transduced HEp3 cells with a
human shRNAGIPZ microRNA-adapted shRNA lentiviral library
(Open Biosystems) built using a native miR-30 primary transcript
to enable processing by the endogenous RNAi pathway. This
library contains 79,805 sequence-verified shRNAs targeting
30,728 human genes contained in 7 pools, along with TurboGFP
to monitor successful transduction. Each pool was used to
transduce HEp3 cells in culture at an MOI (0.2), favoring a single
shRNA integration per cancer cell according to Poisson dis-
tribution. When 25,000 tumor cells are injected intravenously
into the avian embryo, roughly 10% of the cells arrest and
extravasate in the visible and accessible CAM to form isolated
metastatic colonies (Fig. 1a)3. To ensure 3× coverage of the
79805 shRNA clones with 99% confidence, the screen was per-
formed in 100 embryos. Transduced GFP-expressing cells were
injected intravenously into embryos in ex ovo culture at devel-
opmental day 10. On developmental day 15, more than 200,000
colonies in the CAMs of the 100 embryos were surveyed using
intravital microscopy. Of these, 67 morphologically compact
metastatic lesions were identified and excised. These colonies
were dissociated and cultured under selection, and 50 clones were
successfully expanded in culture.
To identify the integrated shRNA, inserts from each clone were
amplified by PCR using common flanking primers and the
resulting cDNA sequences were determined by deep sequencing
on an Illumina platform. Raw sequence reads were subjected to a
stringent filtering algorithm to identify the flanking miRNA
sequences and exclude reads with inconsistent loop sequences
and stem base-pair mismatches. Filtered sequences were then
subjected to BLAST analysis against both the library and the
human nucleotide (nt) database and ranked according to
abundance (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Data 1). We found that
17 of the 50 isolated clones contained a single shRNA, while the
remaining 33 clones each contained more than one shRNA
(Supplementary Data 1).
Identified genes are required for productive cancer cell inva-
sion in vivo. The gene targets were then prioritized based on their
impact on productive cell migration in vivo according to the
degree of their compact colony phenotype. The phenotype of
each clone was validated using an experimental metastasis
approach. Clones were injected intravenously into ex ovo chicken
embryos and images of the resulting metastatic colonies were
captured using intravital imaging. We developed a custom
MATLAB-based program to analyze the images of each meta-
static colony using three complementary algorithms (Fig. 1 and
Supplementary Fig. 1). While we did not detect significant dif-
ferences in the rate of proliferation of the clones in vitro, we
observed that several clones grew at different rates in vivo
(Supplementary Fig 2a). Therefore, to mitigate the effect of dif-
ferences in proliferation between individual colonies and to get an
accurate assessment of in vivo cancer cell motility, we designed
algorithms to analyze three distinct parameters: (A) cancer cell
remoteness from the colony centroid (Linear index); (B) the
density of cancer cells within the metastatic colony area (Density
index) and; (C) the total area occupied by each metastatic colony
(Area index, Supplementary Figs. 1, 2). Briefly, the first algorithm
creates a mask using fluorescence to delineate the cancer cells and

 uses a 360° line-scan through the centroid to build an average line
plot fitted to a Gaussian distribution (Supplementary Fig. 1c). The
deviation in Gaussian radial line-scan intensity distribution
between colonies formed by individual clones relative to control
shRNA colonies is used to generate the Linear index. The second
and third algorithms use the fluorescence mask to measure
individual metastatic colony areas (Area Index) and calculate the
fluorescence density within each area (Density index) (Supple-
mentary Fig. 1d). A minimum of ten individual colonies for each
clone were analyzed. While each index produced a similar
ranking of the colonies identified in the screen, each method
poorly identified a number of visually compact clones when used
alone (Supplementary Fig. 2b−d). For this reason, the three
algorithms were combined to create a composite colony Com-
pactness Index (C.I.) that was used to stratify the phenotypes of
the hit clones compared to the anti-CD151 antibody-treated
positive control and the scrambled shRNA negative control
(Supplementary Data 1, Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 2). The
C.I. was calculated from the Z-scores (experimental − control /
SD control) for each Index where C.I. = Z(Density Index) –
Z(Linear Index) – Z(Area Index).
The morphology of positive control colonies, generated after
treatment with the CD151-targeted migration-blocking antibody
(positive control), exhibited the most dramatic increase in C.I. (17.1
± 1.68) compared to highly invasive metastatic colonies generated
by negative control cells expressing scramble shRNA (negative
control, 0 ± 0.6) (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 2a). Statistical analysis
of the C.I. index revealed 27 clones with metastatic colony
phenotypes whose C.I. differed significantly (p ≤ 0.05) from those
of the negative control (Fig. 1b). Eleven (11) out of these 27 clones
contained single shRNAs (KIF3B, ACTB, SRPK1, TMEM229B,
C14orf142, KB-1460A1.5, ACTC1, NR2F1, KIAA0922, KDELR3,
and APBA2). Clones containing a single shRNA and C.I. ≥ 5.0 were
selected for downstream analysis (Fig. 1c).

Fig. 1 Overview of the in vivo screen for genes required for productive motility. a HEp3 cells were transduced with a pooled whole human genome lentiviral
shRNA library and injected intravenously into 100 ex ovo avian embryos. Compact metastatic colonies derived from single cancer cells were excised 6 days
post injection, expanded and analyzed by Illumina deep sequencing. Colonies were re-injected individually to validate their phenotype and prioritized based
on a composite compactness (C.I.) index. Selected screen hits that produced metastatic colonies that were significantly more compact than those
produced by cancer cells transduced with scramble shRNA transduced cells were selected for further analysis. b Composite compactness index (C.I.)

gene and protein expression in the original and newly derived
clones confirmed the efficient knockdown of the targets in each
cell
line
(Supplementary
Fig.
3a−e).
The
clones
bearing
independent shRNAs (designated sh2) were then validated using
the in vivo metastatic colony formation assay. All clones
reproduced the compact colony phenotype with C.I. values
similar to those of their primary screen hit clone (Supplementary
Fig. 3f).
To gain additional insight into the migratory phenotypes
induced by knockdown of these genes, we performed high-
resolution in vivo time-lapse imaging of individual metastatic
colonies and the invasive front of primary tumors derived from
each clone and the control (scramble) shRNA transduced HEp3
cancer cells. For these studies, we concentrated our efforts on two
clones with high C.I. (KIF3B and SRPK1) and one with lower C.I.
(NR2F1). We observed that shRNA-mediated inhibition of each
of these targets significantly reduced the velocity and productivity
(the net straight-line displacement of a cell from its original
position per unit time) of cancer cell migration in vivo (Fig. 2a−f,
and Supplementary Movies 1, 2). Cancer cells from each of the
KIF3Bsh1/sh2, SRPK1sh1/sh2, and NR2F1sh1/sh2 clones dis-

 metastatic colonies (Supplementary Movie 1 and Fig. 2a, c, d).
While there was no significant reduction in the average velocity of
cancer cells at the invasive front of the primary tumor, productive
motility at the invasive front was reduced by more than 75% in all
clones (Supplementary Movie 2 and Fig. 2b, e, f). This
corresponded well with the significant reduction in the number
of invasive cancer cells observed in the invasive zone around
primary tumors derived from KIF3Bsh1/sh2, SRPK1sh1/sh2, and
NR2F1sh1/sh2
clones
compared
to
the control
(Fig.
2g).
Phenotypically, scramble shRNA control HEp3 cells at the
invasive front tended to form single dominant protrusions in
the direction of motility while KIF3Bsh1/sh2, SRPK1sh1/sh2, and
NR2F1sh1/sh2 clones formed multiple protrusions extending in
all directions in an uncoordinated fashion (Fig. 2b, h and
Supplementary Movies 1, 2).
Kif3b regulates the interaction of cancer cells with the extra-
cellular matrix. Cancer cells invade tissues using the guidance of
tissue structural elements such as vasculature and the collagen-
rich extracellular matrix14–17. Highly metastatic tumor cells dis-
play increased affinity to the vasculature (vasculotropism) and
ability to invade into and rearrange collagen tissue matrix14–17.
Structurally, the chicken embryo CAM is a transparent organ
roughly 200 µm thick consisting of a vascular network sur-
rounded by a dense collagen-rich matrix that can be visualized in
total using in vivo multiphoton imaging (Fig. 3a). Structurally, it
bears a high degree of similarity with mouse lung (Fig. 3b), and
human cancer cells appear to robustly interact with the collagen
fiber network in both tissues (Fig. 3b). We investigated the role of
top target Kif3b in this microenvironment using multiphoton
imaging with second harmonic generation (SHG) to visualize
collagen. We found that control HEp3 cells robustly spread
within the CAM vasculature/collagen fiber network with many
cells directly attaching to the vascular walls and forming long-
lived dominant protrusions that frequently extend along the
individual collagen fibers (Fig. 3c, e–g and Supplementary
Movies 3, 4). In contrast, we found that mutant cells that were
engineered using Kif3B targeting shRNAs showed decreased
vasculotropism and were often surrounded by areas of low col-
lagen density (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Movies 3, 4). Cell pro-
trusions formed by KIF3B mutant cells rarely engaged collagen
fibers and displayed significantly shorter lifetime (Fig. 3c–g, and
Supplementary Movies 3, 4). Both shRNAs targeting Kif3b pro-
tein expression showed very similar effect on HEp3 cancer cell
interaction with the vasculature and collagen fiber network
(Figs. 3 and 4 and Supplementary Figure 4). This phenotype was
also observed in KIF3B mutant human HT1080 fibrosarcoma and
MDA231 breast cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. 3a and Sup-
plementary Fig. 5a–g).
We then examined the cancer cell−collagen matrix interaction
at the invasive primary tumor front. Invading tumor cells actively
reorganize the collagen-rich matrix at primary tumor front
creating areas of densely bundled, aligned collagen fibers that are
used as pathways for invasion out of the primary tumor16,17.
Indeed, HEp3 control tumor fronts had numerous areas of
collagen fiber bundling and alignment with thick (1−3 µm)
bundles of collagen fibers aligned perpendicularly to the primary
tumor front (Fig. 4a−e). Time-lapse, SHG imaging of the primary
tumor fronts showed that control HEp3 cells actively invade
along the aligned collagen bundles forming dominant cell
protrusions that generally orient along the collagen fibers
perpendicular to the primary tumor front (Fig. 4a−c, f and
Supplementary Movie 5). In contrast, tumors comprised of HEp3
cells that express Kif3b targeting shRNAs failed to reorganize the
collagen fiber network at the primary tumor periphery. Collagen
fibers at the Kif3b mutant tumor fronts appeared to be
disorganized with an almost complete absence of collagen
bundles. Rare invasive mutant KIF3B HEp3 cells formed short
non-directional protrusions (Fig. 4a−f and Supplementary Fig. 4b,
d; Supplementary Movie 5). Accordingly, when KIF3B mutant
HEp3, HT1080, and MDA231 cancer cells were tested in a 3D
collagen invasion assay, invasion of the KIF3B mutant cell lines
was significantly reduced (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b). This
suggests that our screening approach preferentially identified
genes required for the coordination of directional in vivo cell
migration and invasion.
Inhibition of identified genes blocks spontaneous metastasis
in vivo. To test the hypothesis that genes required for in vivo cell
motility and directional cell migration are also required for
intravasation and metastasis, we evaluated each of the hit clones
in a xenograft murine model of spontaneous metastasis to the
lungs. To this end, we established subcutaneous HEp3 tumors in
the flank of nude mice using scrambled shRNA control or
KIF3Bsh/sh2, SRPK1sh/sh2, and NR2F1sh/sh2 expressing tumor
cells. When the primary tumors reached 1.5 cm3, the lungs were
examined for the presence of metastasis using whole-mount
fluorescence stereomicroscopy and then quantified using human
alu-specific q-PCR (Fig. 5a, b)14. In animals bearing shRNA
scramble control HEp3 tumors (n = 23), significant metastasis to
the lungs was detected by fluorescence imaging (Fig. 5a). In
contrast, metastatic lesions were rarely observed in the lungs of
animals bearing KIF3Bsh1/sh2, SRPK1sh1/sh2, and NR2F1sh1/
sh2 tumors, and these were very small in size (Fig. 5b, d). To
accurately quantify the burden of metastatic HEp3 cancer cells in
the murine lungs, we extracted genomic DNA and performed
human-specific alu q-PCR. The precise enumeration of metastatic
cells in the lung was then determined by comparing these data to
a standard curve generated from HEp3 cells18. The scramble
shRNA control had an average of 2.4 million disseminated cancer
cells per lung. In contrast, animals bearing KIF3Bsh1/sh2,
SRPK1sh1/sh2, and NR2F1sh1/sh2 tumors had a dramatic inhi-
bition of metastatic dissemination, with reductions in metastasis
to the lungs of 99.55 and 99.67% respectively for KIF3Bsh1 and
sh2, 99.98 and 99.66% respectively for SRPK1sh1 and sh2, and
99.71 and 99.81% respectively for NR2F1sh1 and sh2 (Fig. 5e). To
confirm that this inhibitory effect is not cell type and shRNA gene
knockdown technology limited we used CRISPR technology to
knockout our top target, Kif3b, in the HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell
line (Supplementary Fig. 7a). Subcutaneous injection of control
HT1080 cells resulted in a robust spontaneous lung metastasis as
confirmed by quantitative alu q-PCR, stereomicroscopic and IHC
analysis (Supplementary Fig. 7a–c, e, g). In contrast, in Kif3b
mutant cells metastasis was severely (~80%) inhibited forming
smaller and less frequent lung metastatic lesions (Supplementary
Fig. 7a-c,f,h). There was no significant difference in primary
tumor growth rates between the control and hit shRNA clone
tumors (Supplementary Fig. 7d and Supplementary Fig. 8a).
These results confirm our hypothesis that genes required for
in vivo cell motility and directional cell migration are also
required for spontaneous metastasis, and that KIF3B, SRPK1, and
NR2F1 represent promising therapeutic targets for metastasis.
Considering the possibility that the observed motility pheno-
types could be specific to the highly metastatic human HEp3
epidermoid-carcinoma cell line, we evaluated the silencing of our
top targets KIF3B, SRPK1, and NR2F1 using MAts in vitro cell
migration model using HEp3, HT1080, MDA231, and PC3 human
cancer cell lines. Silencing of Kif3b efficiently blocked in vitro cell

 migration in all of the cancer cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 8b).
Interestingly, silencing SRPK1 significantly inhibited the in vitro
motility of HEp3 and PC3 cells but had no effect on the motility of
MDA-MB-231 (Supplementary Fig. 8c). Silencing of NR2F1
inhibited HEp3 migration in vitro but also had no effect on
MDA-MB-231. No NR2F1 expression was detected in PC3 cells
(Supplementary Fig. 8d). This supports the idea that screening in a
functional in vivo microenvironment is important as these
phenotypes are not necessarily recapitulated in 2D culture.
KIF3B and SRPK1 are overexpressed in invasive prostate
cancer. Next we explored the potential relevance of these genes
for human cancer progression and metastasis. To do this, we
utilized human cancer gene expression databases (Oncomine) to
evaluate associations between hit gene expression and cancer
progression, metastasis or poor clinical outcomes19. Indeed, our
analysis indicated that the top hit genes identified in our screen
are significantly upregulated in the metastatic lesions of several
solid cancer types including: melanoma (KIF3B, C14orf142, and
NR2F1), prostate cancer (SRPK1 and KIF3B), head and neck
cancer (KIF3B), lung cancer (SRPK1 and TMEM229B), ovarian
cancer (NR2F1) and colon cancer (NR2F1) (Supplementary
Fig. 9a). Moreover, a detailed survey of immunohistochemical
staining of human cancers indicated that SRPK1, KIF3B,
C14orf142, NR2F1, and TMEM229B have significantly increased
expression in the invasive zone of the primary tumors of these
cancers as delineated by a pathologist (Supplementary Fig. 9b–g).
Quantitative analysis of an independent prostate cancer pro-
gression TMA cohort (University of Calgary) of 98 patients
showed that both Kif3b and SRPK1 display significantly higher
expression levels in prostate cancer epithelium compared to
benign hyperplasia epithelium (Fig. 6a, b). Both Kif3b (Fig. 6c)
and SRPK1 (Fig. 6d) were expressed at significantly higher levels
in areas where the prostate epithelium is invading into the sur-
rounding stroma, further correlating their overexpression in the
process of prostate cancer invasion and metastasis.
Discussion
We developed a powerful quantitative in vivo screening approach
to discover therapeutic targets for metastasis based on productive
cancer cell motility in a complex tumor microenvironment. Using
a combination of the highly accessible ex ovo avian embryo
model, fluorescence time-lapse intravital imaging and high
throughput sequencing, the platform offers a rapid and quanti-
tative means to detect and efficiently stratify clinically relevant
phenotypes and identify potential therapeutic targets for metas-
tasis. Indeed, all of the hits from this screen that have been
selected for downstream analysis have shown to be effective tar-
gets for metastasis, as their inhibition results in a nearly total
block of metastatic dissemination.
Several of the genes identified in the screen validate the
approach as they have been previously linked with cancer cell
invasion and/or migration. The identification of actin isoforms
ACTB and ACTC1, for instance, is not surprising as they are
central to the cell migration machinery and have been previously
identified using in vitro RNAi screening approaches20. SRPK1 has
been previously implicated in cancer progression and metastasis
through its regulation of VEGF splicing21–23, yet we did not
observe an inhibition of primary tumor growth when SRPK1
expression was reduced. SRPK1 was also recently identified as a
mediator of cell migration using an in vitro RNAi screening
approach21, which when taken together with our results, supports

 the idea that SRPK1 plays a more direct mechanistic role in cell
migration and metastasis. It will be important, going forward, to
identify the distinct but overlapping mechanisms responsible for
productive cell migration in vivo compared to in vitro.
The screen identified several genes of known function that had
not been directly implicated in cancer cell motility and metastasis.
The availability of research tools and in some cases, small molecule
inhibitors, for these targets highlights them as attractive candidates
for further preclinical testing22–25. Identification of KIF3B as our
top target is intriguing since this gene is part of the kinesin motor
machinery responsible for transporting multiple therapeutically
relevant molecules such as β-catenin and MT1-MMP26–28. Along
with Rho kinase signaling, the precise kinesin-driven delivery of
MT1-MMP to the cancer cell front is essential for collagen fiber
matrix realignment and degradation27,28. This is consistent with our
finding that targeting Kif3b expression efficiently inhibits these
processes, blocking cancer cell metastasis. The screen also identified
several genes and non-coding RNAs of unknown function,
including C14orf142, TMEM229b, KB-1460A1.5, and KIAA0922,
whose expression in human cancers would suggest a yet-to-be-
described role in cancer progression and metastasis. The identifi-
cation of putative regulatory pro-metastatic RNAs in particular
warrants further investigation29.
Overall, we found an extraordinarily tight concordance between
a gene’s in vivo cancer cell motility phenotype and its requirement
for successful metastatic spread. This study demonstrates that our
quantitative in vivo imaging-based screening approach is a pow-
erful tool to identify potential therapeutic targets for metastasis,
paving the way for the development of new therapies to block this
deadliest aspect of human cancer.
Methods
Cells, antibodies, and reagents. The human epidermoid-carcinoma cell line
(HEp3), human breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231), and human prostate cancer
cell line (PC3) were obtained from ATCC and maintained as described
previously13. Human shRNAGIPZ microRNA-adapted shRNA lentiviral library
was purchased from Open Biosystems. Control cells were labeled with non-
silencing control viral stock (GFP expressing). For functional MOI calculation
HEp3 cells (105 cells per single well in a 12-well plate) were infected with
shRNAGIPZ library stocks in triplicates and the percentage of GFP-positive cells
was quantified 48 h post infection using EVOS FL Cell Imaging System with six
fields of view per MOI. An MOI = 0.2 was used for all the experiments. Individual,
independent hairpin lentiviral vectors encoding shRNAs targeting SRPK1, NR2F1,
KIF3B, TMEM229B, C14orf142, and ACTB (ready to use lentiviral particles) were
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and used according to the manufacturer
protocols. For Kif3b CRISPR gene knockout guide RNAs with high predicted on-
target effects and low predicted off-target effects were chosen using the Benchling
“Design CRISPR guides” tool (https://benchling.com/). Guide RNAs were cloned
into CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid PX459 (pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro V2.0), a gift from Feng

 Zhang (Addgene plasmid # 62988). Plasmids were expanded in competent
Escherichia coli (Stbl3) and then sequenced. KIF3B CRISPR-Cas9 plasmids were
transfected into HT1080 cells using Lipofectamine 2000. Forty-eight hours post-
transfection, cells were selected using 1 μg/ml puromycin for 72 h. Surviving clones
were expanded and pooled for downstream assays. CRISPR-Cas9 editing of KIF3B
at the genomic level was confirmed using q-PCR.
Antibodies were from Sigma (SRPK1), Santa Cruz Biotechnology (KIF3B) and
Cell Signaling (NR2F1) and Invitrogen (Tubulin). Human TMEM229B and
C14orf142-specific qRT-PCR primer sets were purchased from Bio-Rad.
Quantitative RT-PCR and western immunoblot analysis. Total RNA was
extracted from trypsinized cells with Trizol (Invitrogen). RNA (1 μg) was reverse
transcribed into cDNA by random priming using the One-Step RT-PCR Kit
(QIAGEN). Quantification of cDNA was done using SYBR Green Supermix for
real-time q-PCR (Bio-Rad) with oligonucleotide sequences that specifically
recognize GAPDH, TMEM229B or C14orf142. GAPDH was used as a control for
total cDNA. Samples for western immunoblot analysis were prepared by lysing
1.2×107 cells of interest with 400 μl of lysis buffer (1% IGEPAL CA-630 in PBS with
1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma)) on ice for 30 min and collection of
supernatants from centrifugation of samples at 4 °C at 16,000 × g for 15 min.
Twenty micrograms of protein was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE gels and trans-
ferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) using a Trans-blot Turbo Transfer
system. Membranes were blocked in 50% blocking buffer (LI-COR) in PBS at room
temperature for 1 h and incubated with primary antibody in 50% blocking buffer at
4 °C overnight. At room temperature, membranes were then washed three times
with TBS-Tween (TBST; 0.1%), incubated with a loading control antibody for 1 h,
washed three more times with TBST, incubated with secondary antibodies
(ThermoFisher Scientific, Alexa Fluor®−680 or −750) for 1 h, and washed again
three times with TBST. Proteins were then detected using the Odyssey® Classic
Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR).
Ex ovo chick embryo cancer xenograft model. Fertilized White Leghorn chicken
eggs were purchased from University of Alberta Poultry Research Centre and
incubated in a humidified chamber at 38 °C. At day 4, embryos were removed from
their shells using a Dremel tool with a cutting wheel and maintained under shell-
less conditions, in a covered dish in a humidified air incubator at 38 °C and 60%
humidity as previously described3,12. On day 10 of development, chicken embryos
were injected intravenously with 2.5×104 HEp3 cells that were transduced with
shRNAGIPZ library or control lentiviral particles. Metastatic colonies were allowed
to grow for 6 days and individual compact metastatic colonies were excised using
micro-dissection scissors. Excised colonies were expanded under selective (pur-
omycin) conditions, cryopreserved at earliest possible passage (p1−3) and used for
further analysis as necessary. For time-lapse imaging of metastatic colonies, ster-
ilized coverslips were applied on top of the CAM that contains metastatic colonies
24 h post tumor cell application. For imaging studies involving modeling of pri-
mary tumor fronts tumors, day 10 chicken embryos had 2×105 HEp3 cells in
serum-free media injected directly in between CAM ectoderm and endoderm
layers. Sterilized coverslips were applied on top of the tumor 24 h post
tumor cell application and invasive fronts were imaged 5 days post tumor cell
inoculation.
3D collagen invasion assay. HEp3, HT1080, or MDA231 human cancer cells (105
cells/well) stably labeled with GFP were cultured on the top of 3D collagen gel
matrixes (2.5 mg/ml, ~200 μm thickness, eight-well Lab-Tek chambered slides) for
36 (HT1080, HEp3) or 48 h (MDA231) as described elsewhere28. 36–48 h later
random 3D image fields were obtained using Nikon A1r MP two-photon micro-
scope. Number of cells that invaded ≥100 μm from the gel surface was quantified
manually. At least ten independent fields from two independent wells were ana-
lyzed for each condition.
Image acquisition and analysis. Real-time imaging of cancer cell invasion was
performed by acquiring four-dimensional image series of single cancer cells within
the CAM. A 50−60 µm image stack was acquired every 15 min in 1–3 µm step size
increments for 2–8 h. A Zeiss upright microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc.) fitted with a
temperature-regulated enclosure (Plastics Inc.), an XY stage controller (Ludl Inc.),
a 405/491/561/646/750 nm diode laser switcher (Quorum Technologies Inc.), a
Hamamatsu 512 × 512 EMCCD camera (Hamamatsu Inc.) and full range of Zeiss
microscope objectives were used for image acquisition. Volocity Acquisition soft-
ware (Improvision Inc.) was used to control the microscope and acquire all images.
Image analysis and processing was performed using Volocity and ImageJ (NIH).
Nikon A1r MP two-photon microscope equipped with ×25 WI objective was used
for multicolor imaging of cancer cells and chicken embryo CAM vasculature. 860
nm (Spectra Physics Insight DS + laser, NDD acquisition mode) wavelength was
used for SHG chicken CAM collagen imaging. Image drift was corrected using the
ImageJ Stack_Reg plugin (Biomedical Imaging Group, http://bigwww.epfl.ch/)
prior to tracking analysis. Time 0 was defined as the time of the first image capture.
At least 20 individual cells were tracked for control cells and each knockdown clone
(Fig. 2c–f) using the built-in Volocity Object tracking module. Track velocity was
calculated as average speed of the track. Track displacement rate (productivity) was
calculated using the built-in Volocity module as total track displacement (straight
line distance from the first track position to the last) divided by track time. For
quantification of invasive cells per field, snapshots of invasive fronts for least ten
independent tumors (×10 magnification) were analyzed for each condition
(Fig. 2g). For cell protrusion quantification, invasive tumor fronts were imaged at
×20 magnification and at least 25 individual cells were analyzed for each condition
(Fig. 2h). Invasive cells per field and cell protrusion numbers were quantified
manually using ImageJ software. Collagen fiber and cell protrusion angle was
quantified using the ImageJ built-in angle measurement module (“acute”, sharper
angle was used for each measurement). At least 150 collagen fibers or 100 cell
protrusions (3–10 independent tumors for each condition) were analyzed. Results
were plotted as angle frequency distribution, bin = 10, built-in Prism analysis
module.
Colony compactness quantification. We used MATLAB to derive a composite
colony compactness index (C.I.) based on three different colony attributes: cell
distribution within a colony, colony area, and colony density. Images of individual
colonies were converted to grayscale (rgb2gray function) and had background
signal subtracted. Uneven illumination was corrected using top-hat filtering
(imtophat function) using a 10-pixel radius disk-shaped structural element. The
colony centroids were determined (regionprops function) and images were trans-
lated so that colony centroids were in the center of images. Pixel-intensity line plots
along each image row were determined (improfile function) and line plots for all
rows were averaged. For each colony image, row average line plots were calculated
for 18 different images that were rotated 20° from each other (360° total rotation)
and row average line plots over all 18 rotated images were averaged, creating a
single line plot. This line plot was fitted to a Gaussian distribution and the standard
deviation of the distribution was the measure of cell distribution within colonies.
Colony area was determined using the “bwconvhull” function on binary images of
colonies with only cancer cells visible. Colony density was determined as the
fraction of pixels within the colony convex hull area that contained cancer cells.

Colony compactness index (C.I.) values were determined which represents the
relative level of compactness for each hit / clone. To ensure higher C.I. values for
more compact colonies, the Z(cell distribution – Linear Index) and Z(colony
area – Area Index) were subtracted from Z(colony density – Density Index) since
Z(colony density) was positive in compact colonies while Z(cell distribution) and
Z(colony area) were negative in compact colonies.

Five to ten embryos were re-injected for each clone and CAM/metastatic
colonies images were randomly acquired 5 days post injection using Zeiss Lumar
V12 stereoscope equipped with ×1.5 objective (see Supplementary Fig. 4 for
example). Single metastatic colony images were randomly cut out digitally and used
for C.I. quantification. Ten randomly chosen metastatic colony images were
analyzed for each of the screen hits. Z-scores were determined for all three colony
attributes. For quantification of HT1080 and MDA231 colony compactness ×25
images (Nikon A1r microscope) were used. Similar to HEp3 cells at least ten
randomly selected metastatic colony images were used. The C.I. quantification
module exists as a stand-alone package and is available upon request along with
sample metastatic colony images.
In vitro MAts migration assay. In vitro MAts migration assay was performed as
previously described30. Briefly, control and mutant cancer cells (HEp3, MDA-MB-
231, and PC3) were seeded in a 12-well culture plates with pre-attached MAts 12 h
before the assay to achieve sub-confluency (70–80%) at the day of experiment. No
significant effect on cancer cell proliferation was detected in shSRPK1, shKIF3B,
shNR2F1 or scramble shRNA expressing cells (data not shown). At the day of the
assay MAts were removed and cells were allowed to migrate for 6-12 h depending
on the cell line tested. All assays were done in triplicate and images were acquired
using an EVOS FL Cell Imaging System, ten fields of view per condition. Data
analysis to determine percentage of total pixels that were not covered (percentage
open area) was done using TScratch software version 1.0 for Windows with
MATLAB Compiler Runtime (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich,
Zürich, Switzerland).
Mouse spontaneous metastasis model. The ability of tumors derived from
KIF3Bsh/sh2, SRPK1sh/sh2, and NR2F1sh/sh2 HEp3 cancer cells to spontaneously
metastasize from primary tumors to the lung was compared to control using a
xenograft athymic (nu/nu) mouse model. 1×106 HEp3-GFP or HT1080-RFP cells
were implanted subcutaneously in the rear flank of week 21 female athymic (nu/nu,
HEp3 cells) or SCID (HT1080 cells) mice and the resulting tumors were monitored
until they reached a volume of 1500 mm3. At this point, the lungs were harvested

 and visualized with a Zeiss Lumar V12 fluorescence stereomicroscope with bright
field and GFP filters. To precisely quantify the burden of human HEp3 cancer cells
in the mouse lungs, q-PCR was performed with primers specific for human Alu
repeats and mouse GAPDH. Quantitative PCR using Alu-specific primers was
performed using the SYBR green amplification from the Extract-N-Amp kit as
previously described14. Quantitative PCR using mouse GAPDH primers was used
to normalize for tissue input. A standard curve was generated using a serial dilution
of HEp3 cells at known concentrations and compared to the in vivo results to
estimate absolute cancer cell numbers. All animals were housed, maintained and
treated by procedures approved by University of Alberta Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committees (IACUC).

obtained from the Human Protein Atlas (www.proteinatlas.org) was conducted by
a certified pathologist (B.A.). Only the samples with medium to high IHC scoring
intensity in either normal prostate or cancer tissue were included in invasive tumor
front identification. Detailed information regarding the Protein Atlas sample
quality assurance can be found at http://www.proteinatlas.org/qc.php.
A meta-analysis of individual genes across publicly accessible prostate cancer
expression databases was performed using the meta-analysis tool within Oncomine
(https://www.oncomine.com), the steps of which have been previously described in
detail19. Briefly, microarray data from individual studies were normalized, and
differential expression between pre-specified classes was determined by Student’s t
test. Genes were ranked within each dataset by the p value, and enrichment
(positive or negative) across studies was determined by comparing observed
rankings against a random distribution. Studies selected had a patient cohort >20
and allowed differential expression analysis within Oncomine. Patient annotated
gene expression heat maps were generated using Oncomine.
Prostate cancer progression TMA analysis. IHC was performed on a progres-
sion TMA (University of Calgary) from 98 patients, for a total of 320 cores. Tissue
samples targeted included benign (n = 80) and localized PCa (n = 162). Diagnosis
of TMA cores was confirmed by the study pathologists (T.A.B.). IHC stain was
performed using auto-stainer of Dako Omnis (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) for
KIF3B or Leica BondMax (Leica Biosystems Inc. Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) for
SRPK1. Anti KIF3B and SRPK1 antibodies were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis,
MO, USA).
Four micron FFPE sections were pretreated with heat-induced epitope retrieval
procedure that was carried out on the auto-stainer as routine IHC procedure.
Citrate pH 6.0 epitope retrieval buffer was for KIF3B and SRPK1. Antibody was
diluted to 1/100 to 1/400-fold using Dako antibody diluent. Primary antibody
incubation was carried out for 30 min on Omnis or 15 min on Bond, while
secondary incubation was carried out for 30 min on Omnis or 8 min on Bond.
FLEX DAB + Substrate Chromogen system for Omnis or Bond Polymer Refine
Detection kit for BondMax was used as post incubation detection reagent.
To quantify the protein expression, images were converted into 8-bit grayscale,
inverted and average intensity within region of interest was quantified using ImageJ
software. Antibodies were from Abcam (SRPK1) and Sigma (Kif3b).
Statistics. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Data are presented as
the mean ± s.e.m. Unless otherwise indicated, data were tested for significance
using one-way ANOVA with Fisher’s LSD test. The level of significance was set at
p < 0.05.
Data availability. Authors can confirm that all relevant data are included in the
paper and/or its Supplementary Information files.
