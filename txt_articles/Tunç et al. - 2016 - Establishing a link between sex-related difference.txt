Recent years have witnessed an increased attention to studies of sex
differences, partly because such differences offer important considerations
for personalized medicine. While the presence of sex differences in human be-
haviour is well documented, our knowledge of their anatomical foundations in
the brain is still relatively limited. As a natural gateway to fathom the human
mind and behaviour, studies concentrating on the human brain network
constitute an important segment of the research effort to investigate sex differ-
ences. Using a large sample of healthy young individuals, each assessed with
diffusion MRI and a computerized neurocognitive battery, we conducted a
comprehensive set of experiments examining sex-related differences in the
meso-scale structures of the human connectome and elucidated how these
differences may relate to sex differences at the level of behaviour. Our results
suggest that behavioural sex differences, which indicate complementarity of
males and females, are accompanied by related differences in brain structure
across development. When using subnetworksthat are defined over functional
and behavioural domains, we observed increased structural connectivity
related to the motor, sensory and executive function subnetworks in males.
In females, subnetworks associated with social motivation, attention and
memory tasks had higher connectivity. Males showed higher modularity com-
pared to females, with females having higher inter-modular connectivity.
Applying multivariate analysis, we showed an increasing separation between
males and females in the course of development, not only in behavioural
patterns but also in brain structure. We also showed that these behavioural
and structural patterns correlate with each other, establishing a reliable link
between brain and behaviour.
1. Background
While the presence of sex differences in human behaviour and cognition is well
documented [1,2], our knowledge of anatomical foundations for such sex differ-
ences, specifically in the brain, is still relatively limited. The enigmatic interplay
between brain and behaviour, and its modulation by sex, has intrigued scien-
tists, philosophers and the general public for decades. Behavioural differences
include, but are not limited to, enhanced motor [3,4] and spatial skills [5,6] in
males and improved memory [7,8] and social cognition [9,10] skills in females
[11]. These differences may be attributed to the complementary roles that the
sexes play in procreation and social structure; however, increasing evidence
suggests the presence of corresponding sex differences in brain structure and
function [12–17], as well as the presence of a strong connection between behav-
iour and brain structure [12,18]. Thus, relying merely on social and cultural
effects to explain sex-induced variance in behaviour seems insufficient. Notably,
although sex differences in the brain are present even in childhood [16,17], the

 developmental trajectory of sex differences as related to the
brain–behaviour relationship remains relatively unexamined.
With the advent of neuroimaging, both the structure and
function of the human brain can be studied in vivo. This
capacity facilitates enquiries on large samples and investi-
gation of possible differences between males and females.
Several research groups [19–23] including ours [17] have
used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) [24] to study sex-related
structural differences in the brain, as characterized by altera-
tions in white matter (WM) microstructure and fibre tracts
that connect different grey matter (GM) regions, as well as in
overall communication architecture of the brain network.
Studying the structural brain network, also known as the
structural connectome [25], enables the inference of current and
future states of brain connectivity at local, global and inter-
mediate (meso) scales. In a connectome, the identification of
network properties pertaining to meso-scale structures such
as communities [26] or the communication backbone [27]
can reveal how the complex human behavioural repertoire
emerges fromthesimultaneous processesofsegregatedneuronal
clusters and their integration during complicated cognitive tasks
[28,29]. In this work, we have investigated sex differences in
the meso-scale architecture, specifically in subnetworks, of the
structural connectome. A subnetwork is a collection of brain
regions (nodes) and their connections (edges) that forms a part
of the whole-brain network [30,31].
Previous work on sex differences in brain structure
suggested diverse outcomes including microstructural dif-
ferences demonstrated via changes in DTI-based measures,
like fractional anisotropy (FA); namely, increased FA values
in major WM regions and tracts in males [19,20,23], and in
the corpus callosum in females [22]. Consistent with these
findings, we have performed a comprehensive analysis on
the structural connectome to elucidate sex differences in
terms of individual connections [17], revealing stronger intra-
hemispheric connectivity (within both hemispheres) in males
and stronger inter-hemispheric connectivity in females. The
developmental course of sex differences is a less explored
domain [11], mostly due to lack of large datasets spanning
age ranges that include the developmental period, with a few
exceptions in the case of structural, functional and behavioural
modalities [11,16,17,21,32].
Although it is generally tempting to derive (possibly
stereotypical)
conclusions
based
on
the
structural
and
functional sex differences in the brain, pertaining to the be-
havioural
manifestations,
scientifically
sound
inferences
require a multimodal investigation that includes behavioural
measurements as a modality. The Philadelphia Neurodevel-
opmental Cohort (PNC) dataset [33], which is a collection
of structural, functional and behavioural modalities, provides
a unique opportunity to achieve this investigational purpose.
Using a large sample of healthy young individuals from
the PNC dataset, each assessed using diffusion MRI and a
computerized neurocognitive battery (CNB), we identified
structural changes in the subnetworks of the structural
connectome and elucidated how these changes may relate to
sex differences at the level of behaviour. In our previous
work [17], the analyses were mostly limited to individual con-
nections between regions, while in this work, we have mainly
studied subnetworks of the brain network in order to establish
a reliable link between brain structure and behaviour. Hence,
our findings on the structural connectome augment but do
not repeat our previously reported findings. The analyses
were repeated in different age ranges to render a developmen-
tal portrait of sex differences. Our results suggest that sex-
related differences in functional and behavioural dimensions
are accompanied by related changes in the network properties
of the structural connectome, establishing a reliable link
between brain structure and behaviour.
2. Results
Presented here are our findings on the network-level sex differ-
ences in the human structural connectome, as well as their
relation to sex differences in behaviour. First, we identified
overall sex-related changes in the network topology of the
structural connectome and explored possible differences
between male and female groups in terms of alliance of the
brain regions, i.e. the way the subnetworks are formed. Then,
we identified group differences on these subnetworks by
comparing intra- and inter-subnetwork connectivities between
males and females. Finally, we established possible links
between
features
of
subnetworks
and
the
behavioural
measures, with an aim of demonstrating the interplay between
brain structure and behaviour. For the developmental analysis,
we divided the entire dataset into three age ranges, namely
children (aged 8–13.3 years), adolescents (aged 13.4–17
years) and young adults (aged 17.1–22 years). The age
ranges were chosen to reflect conventional classification and
also to ensure that the samples are balanced in terms of the
number of participants.
(a) Network topology of the structural connectome
We first investigated differences in network topology of the
structural connectome between males and females. We
measured the modularity of the network, a measure of struc-
tural/functional segregation that quantifies the degree to
which the network can be subdivided into densely intercon-
nected groups of regions [34]. A higher modularity means
increased segregation of such groups of regions, as well as
increased integration inside the groups, possibly pertaining
to the functional specialization of neuronal clusters. In our
experiments, males showed significantly higher modularity
compared with females, evident in all age ranges (children,
p , 0.05; adolescents, p , 0.01; young adults, p , 0.01).
We also compared intra- and inter-modular communi-
cations between groups, by first extracting modules of the
brain network for each participant using the Louvain commun-
ity detection algorithm [35]. Then, we calculated the average
connectivity within the modules (intra-modular) and between
the modules (inter-modular). Consistent with the decreased
modularity, females had higher inter-modular connectivity,
with significant differences emerging only with the entire
dataset ( p , 0.05) and in the oldest age range (p , 0.01).
(b) Alliance of brain regions into subnetworks
Before performing furtheranalysis on structurally cohesive sub-
networks, using the methodology that is described in §4, we
first investigated whether there was a statistically significant
difference between males and females in the alliance of the
brain regions into subnetworks. The absence of such a differ-
ence demonstrated that a common subnetwork portrait could
be defined for the entire sample to facilitate a comparison
between groups. With a significance level of 0.05, we could

 not find any statistically significant sex difference between the
regional compositions of the subnetworks. We repeated this
experiment for different age ranges and with different subnet-
work scales (i.e. the number and size of subnetworks), with
the same result.
(c) Connectivity within and between subnetworks
We defined three types of subnetworks (see §4(e) for details).
First, we extracted structurally cohesive subnetworks by detect-
ing
densely
connected
brain
regions
(also
known
as
communities [26]). An illustration of such 10 subnetworks is
given in figure 1. We repeated this analysis with different num-
bers of subnetworks, with similar results. Second, we defined
subnetworks based on the functional definitions of regional
combinations, adapted from the fMRI literature. Third, we
defined subnetworks that are putatively associated with specific
behavioural domains, based on neuropsychological literature.
Consistent with our previously published edge-wise ana-
lysis [17], the connectivity within and between structurally
cohesive subnetworks, when the connections were predomin-
antly inter-hemispheric, was higher in females, and was
higher in males when connections were predominantly intra-
hemispheric. Illustrative results are shown in figure 1, and a
complete list of group differences is provided in table 1.

 associated with executive control tasks (fronto-parietal and
cingulo-opercular) was higher in males. In females, connect-
ivity among subcortical, sensory and attention subnetworks
was higher. The results are listed in table 2.
Using the subnetworks that are associated with specific
behavioural domains (see table 3 for assignment of nodes to
the subnetworks), we observed higher connectivity in males
related to the motor, sensory and executive function subnet-
works. In reward and memory subnetworks, we observed
higher connectivity in females. Table 4 lists all significant
group differences.
(d) Cognition and motor abilities
We then investigated sex differences in performance on the
CNB. Sex differences in cognition and motor abilities in
different subsets of the PNC dataset have been repeatedly
reported [11,16]. We confirmed these group differences in
our subsample of PNC participants. Specifically, in the com-
plex reasoning category of the CNB [11], males were more
accurate on spatial and language tasks, while females were
faster on non-verbal reasoning ( p , 0.05, FDR). In motor
and sensorimotor tasks, males performed faster ( p , 0.05,
FDR). Although females were faster in emotion identification,
unlike previously reported results, the difference was not
statistically significant ( p ¼ 0.26, FDR) in our sample.
(e) Multivariate pattern analysis for classification of sex
The univariate analyses that we have performed thus far help
investigate simple structural and behavioural differences
between males and females, based on single features such as
the mean connectivity in a specific subnetwork or the accuracy
of a single cognitive task. Next, we undertook a multivariate
analysis to facilitate the investigation of complex interactive
patterns of behaviour or connectivity. By training a pattern
classifier to distinguish between males and females, we can
learn how multiple features (e.g. connectivity of multiple
subnetworks) interact and contribute towards the separation
of the groups.

 We trained two separate classifiers using structural
subnetwork features and behavioural features (see §4(f)). The
classification using subnetwork features yielded an overall
accuracy of 0.79, while the accuracy of the behavioural classifier
was 0.64. Thus, the separation between males and females at
the level of brain structure was significantly larger (p , 0.01)
compared with the separation at the level of behaviour.
For both classifiers, there was a trend of increasing classifi-
cation
accuracies
with
age,
with
the
highest
accuracy
achieved when the oldest groups were used; this is illustrated
in figure 2.
We then assigned each participant a dimensional classifi-
cation score (for each classifier separately), quantifying the
certainty of assignment of the participant to its sex group.
This was used to examine how patterns of connectivity and be-
haviour relate to each other, while being modulated by sex. The
correlation between classification scores of structural and be-
havioural classifiers was statistically significant (p , 0.01),
albeit small (0.31). This remained significant even when correl-
ating the classification scores of male and female groups
separately (female: 0.12, male: 0.16, p , 0.01), indicating that
sex-typical patterns of behaviour and connectivity could be
related within a given sex.
3. Discussion
Recent years have witnessed an increased attention to studies
of sex differences due to their implications in personalized
medicine, and gender-specific medicine has evolved as
diseases follow a different aetiology based on gender [36].
As a natural gateway to fathom the human mind and
behaviour, studies concentrating on human brain networks
constitute an important segment of this sophisticated research
effort to understand sex differences. In this work, we studied
sex-related differences in brain connectivity by conducting
a
comprehensive
set
of
experiments
on
the
structural
connectome, with an emphasis on its meso-scale structures.
Starting from the global properties of the brain network,
we discerned important group differences. We observed
higher modularity in males compared with females. This
might be due to either increased intra-modular or decreased
inter-modular connectivity in males. Simultaneously, females
showed increased inter-modular connectivity, possibly conse-
quent to increased inter-hemispheric connectivity [17] (see
also table 1 and figure 1) since the modular structure of the
human brain is predominantly shaped by the hemispheres.
The distribution of connections between intra- and inter-
modular communications may provide an insight into how
the network manages to orchestrate segregated neuronal clus-
ters, each of which is putatively associated with a different set
of functions.
Notably,
the
reverse
(i.e. decreased modularity and
increased inter-modular connectivity in males) has been
shown previously [16], using resting state fMRI connectivity
in another subsample of the PNC dataset. These findings jointly
render a complex picture of the simultaneous processes in
the brain. The structural basis of the brain network points to a
more integrated modular architecture for females beginning
in early childhood, and perhaps the increased inter-modular

 functional connectivity in males may reflect compensation
to attain integration at the functional level. Increased inter-
modular functional connectivity is possibly achieved by using
highly connected functional systems such as the default mode
network (the regions of which are part of the structural core
of the brain network [37]) that integrates cognitive processes
[38]. Our results support such a hypothesis by demonstrating
higher structural connectivity in the default mode network in
males (table 2).
The alliance of brain regions when forming structurally
cohesive subnetworks does not differ significantly between
males and females, indicating a fixed reference frame within
which we can compare subnetworks between groups without
concern for bias by the sex of the sample being used. In other
words, we can define a common set of subnetworks for
males and females, and then compare them based on their
subject-specific manifestation on inter- and intra-subnetwork
connectivities. The resting state fMRI study [16] mentioned in
§2(c) reported the same conclusion that the regional compo-
sitions of subnetworks do not differ between male and
female brains. This finding is crucial as it indicates that the
network organization of male and female brains does not
differ despite the significant difference in volume between
the sexes (in our sample, there was a significant difference in
volume between the sexes, p , 0.01). As the alliance of individ-
ual brain regions is similar in males and females, one may
stipulate similar functional associations for the neuronal
clusters (subnetworks).
Links between brain structure and behaviour possibly
rely on a complex interplay between multiple features of
the neurobiological mechanisms in the brain network. Net-
work theoretic studies pertaining to the properties of the
structural connectome may provide pioneering insights into
these links. Here, we have established sex-related differences
in the connectivity of the subnetworks that were defined
based on structural characteristics, functional systems and
finally behavioural domains. From a structural perspective,
when subnetworks were identified as structurally cohesive
communities, we observed higher inter-hemispheric connec-
tions in females and increased intra-hemispheric connections
in males (figure 1 and table 1). Elaborate behavioural inferences
based on these differences, however, require direct and rigor-
ous
investigations,
performed
over
specific
functional
systems of the brain.
In order to provide a better association between the struc-
ture and function of the brain, we delineated subnetworks
based on the definitions of functional systems in the fMRI lit-
erature [39]. Analysis of these subnetworks revealed several
functionally related differences between male and female
groups. Consistent with the behavioural findings on sex differ-
ences [3,11], males had increased connectivity between motor
and sensory (auditory) systems, along with increased connect-
ivity in the fronto-parietal and cingulo-opercular systems that
are traditionally associated with complex reasoning and con-
trol (table 2). Furthermore, males had higher connectivity in
the integration of the default mode network with subcortical
and sensory (visual) systems. Default mode network has
been associated with self-related and internal processes such
as stimulus-independent thoughts and introspection [40]. It is
also believed to play an important role in the integration of cog-
nitive processes [38]. On the other hand, females had increased
connectivity with subcortical regions, attention (both dorsal
and ventral) systems and sensory (both visual and auditory)
systems (table 2). The subcortical regions including amygdala,
hypothalamus, hippocampus, dorsal striatum (caudate and
putamen), ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens), thalamus
and pallidum have been mainly associated with emotion
processing, social cognition and motivation [41–43]. In agree-
ment with our findings, improved socially relevant skills
have been reported in females [9,10]. We showed that the
integration between attention systems and sensory systems
was stronger in females, also consistent with behavioural
literature [11].
Similar results were observed when we defined subnet-
works based on their putative behavioural domains (table 4).
Males had higher connectivity between motor, executive func-
tions and sensory (auditory) systems. Females, on the other
hand, had higher connectivity between reward, memory and
sensory (auditory) systems. Higher memory performance in
females has been extensively reported [7,8]. The neuropsycho-
logical processes that are managed by the reward circuitry
have been traditionally linked to social motivation because
anticipation of the rewarding value of a stimulus and then
determination of its relevance in other cognitive tasks are crit-
ical for engaging and maintaining social interactions [42,44].
Both sets of results regarding functionally defined and
behaviourally relevant subnetworks point to an intriguing
sex difference in the processing of sensory inputs (auditory
and visual). Males had higher connectivity between sensory,
motor and default mode systems, while for females higher
connectivity was observed between sensory, subcortical,
reward and attention systems (tables 2 and 4). This might
suggest a better perception–action coordination in males,
and better anticipation and subsequent processing of socially
and emotionally relevant cues in females.
In our final set of experiments, we identified complex and
subtle relationships between behaviour and brain structure,
using multivariate analysis techniques. We were able to dis-
tinguish males from females using a pattern classifier, with
features extracted from both structural connectivity patterns
as
well
as
behavioural
assessments.
The
classification
accuracy showed an improving trend across development,
suggesting an increasing sex difference both in the brain struc-
ture and behaviour (figure 2). This indicates an augmented
separation between males and females in the course of develop-
ment, not only in terms of behavioural patterns but also those
related to the brain structure. Hence, it is clear that the behav-
ioural differences between males and females are accompanied
by related structural differences across their development. The
separation at the level of brain structure was higher than that
at the level of behaviour, suggesting that not all structural
differences manifest themselves in the behavioural measures
used in the current battery. We also showed a statistically sig-
nificant,
but
relatively
small,
correlation
between
the
classification scores of individuals, which quantify the certainty
of their assignment to one of the groups (males or females),
when this score is calculated using structural and behavioural
patterns. Overall, these findings may indicate that the causal
relationship between brain structure and behaviour, should
any exist, may not be linear. It could be affected by numerous
nonlinearities contributed by other factors such as environ-
ment, culture, even economics or politics.
Importantly, except for the multivariate classification
analysis, all our findings are observations on sample averages,
i.e. they are not individual level but group differences. In order

 individual compared to the general population, one will need
to perform more direct analyses on individual differences.
The methodology used in this work paves the way for such
future studies, as the features that we used here (e.g. the
mean within subnetwork connectivity) are calculated for
each individual participant. Thus, one may assign a standard-
ized score to each individual based on the distribution of a
feature, quantifying the status of the individual compared to
their group. This may also facilitate a function specific analysis,
as we were able to define subnetworks based on their func-
tional definitions, with individuals being assigned scores
pertaining to each functional subnetwork. More sophisticated
analyses can be performed by using multivariate pattern
analysis methods trying to predict specific behavioural
measurements using structural network features.
Despite their scientific relevance and significance, sex differ-
ences in the brain structure are a sensitive topic and a source of
much ethical and related controversy. The almost hard-wired
nature of structural differences is unfortunately sometimes
interpreted by the media and the general public as defining con-
stant, discrete and immutable boundaries between the sexes.
Therefore, we need to emphasize that structural differences
do not imply aetiology or prognosis, and the current work has
several limitations.
First, several practical limitations prevented us from using
a functional modality (e.g. fMRI) as an investigative inter-
mediary between structure and behaviour. Instead, we made
comparisons to a previously published work that used a sub-
sample of the PNC data and resting state fMRI [16]. Second,
in our developmental experiments, we defined three age
groups and compared cross-sectional findings of
these
groups, without using a true longitudinal experimental
design. We divided our sample to have an almost equal
number of individuals in each group, as in Ingalhalikar et al.
[17], without any considerations of puberty or other factors
that may be developmentally relevant, such as race or ethnicity.
It is expected that one of the primary drivers of sex differences
in the brain, especially during puberty, may be the hormonal
regulation of the brain. Similarly, ethnicity may also affect
sex-related differences both in brain and in behaviour. Thus,
future studies that concentrate on developmental aspects of
sex differences should consider such factors in order to
render a more detailed picture. Such a broader scope was not
aimed for in the current study since our sample did not include
any data on the hormonal state of participants. It should be
noted that when the sample is divided into subsamples follow-
ing any rationale, there is always a possibility that some other
factor affects the results. Our main goal is to demonstrate the
synchrony between sex-related differences in the brain net-
work and behaviour, regardless of their underlying causal
mechanisms. Hence, the effect of a factor such as puberty
that possibly modulates interrelation between brain network
and behaviour, thereby having an important role in the
underlying causal mechanisms, is beyond the scope of the cur-
rent work. Third, we did not take into account developmental
differences in GM such as differential growth of regions.
Detailed investigation of the effect of volumetric changes
in GM regions on the creation of the connectome is an
active area of ongoing research. We believe that as the field of
connectomics evolves, the study of connectivity-based sex
differences will gain from new and better ways of creating
the connectomes, leading to further insights.
4. Material and methods
(a) Participants
Institutional Review Board approval was obtained from the
University of Pennsylvania and the Children’s Hospital of
Philadelphia. Participants were excluded due to missing cognitive
data, poor imaging data quality or a history that suggested poten-
tial abnormalities of brain development such as a history of medical
problems that might affect brain function, a history of inpatient psy-
chiatric hospitalization, or current use of psychotropic medication.
The final study sample included 900 participants. Details on the
demographics of the data are given in table 5.
(b) Image acquisition and connectome construction
Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) scans
were acquired for each individual. Details of the image acquisition,
tensor construction and generation of connectome are provided by
Ingalhalikar et al. [17]. The connectome construction is illustrated
in figure 3.
(c) Computerized neurocognitive battery
The CNB [11,45] was administered to all participants, and con-
sisted of 14 tests that evaluated a broad range of cognitive
functions. Each test provided measures of accuracy and speed,
with an exception of the motor tests that only measured speed,
giving a total of 26 cognitive measures. For the multivariate ana-
lysis described in §4(f), we also included five psychiatric
evaluation measures related to symptoms of mood disorders, psy-
chosis, externalizing, phobias and overall psychopathology [46].
(d) Alliance of brain regions into subnetworks
We tested whether there is a significant difference in the regional
compositions of subnetworks between male and female groups.
To this end, we calculated a mean connectome for both male and
female groups and detected subnetworks in both, using the
Louvain community detection algorithm [35] as implemented
in Brain Connectivity Toolbox [34]. We measured the similarity
between two sets of subnetworks using the normalized mutual
information (NMI) [47]. We then repeated the same measure-
ment 1000 times while permuting gender labels, recalculating
mean connectivity matrices and re-detecting subnetworks. This
produced a null distribution of NMI values, corresponding to
the null hypothesis that the similarity of subnetwork structures

 between two randomly generated groups would be equal to or
lower than the similarity between actual male and female
groups. Finally, we compared the actual NMI value calculated
using the true male and female groups to the null distribution,
to calculate the probability of observing this NMI, or more
extreme values, when the null hypothesis is true.
(e) Comparison of subnetwork connectivity
We generated subnetworks of the structural connectome with
three different procedures, and compared male and female
groups in terms of the mean connectivity within and between
subnetworks. First, we formed structurally cohesive subnetworks
based on their distinct structural connectivity patterns. We used
multi-view spectral clustering [31,48] to decompose the connect-
ome into a common set of subnetworks that are defined by
densely connected brain regions. This facilitates comparisons
between male and female groups in terms of mean connectivity
within and between subnetworks since the subnetworks are
common for males and females.
Second, with the aim of linking sex differences in the
brain structure and function, we defined functionally defined
subnetworks based on the functional associations of the brain
regions based on the fMRI literature [39]. We assigned brain regions
to 10 functional systems, namely auditory, cingulo-opercular,
default mode, dorsal attention, fronto-parietal, motor, subcortical,
ventral attention, visual and others, using the definitions from
Gu et al. [49].
Third, we defined subnetworks by considering several specific
behavioural domains with which they are putatively associated.
For this purpose, we compiled seven subnetworks, namely audi-
tory,
executive
functions,
memory,
motor,
reward,
social
cognition and visual, based on a literature review on the
neuropsychological associations of brain regions. For the motor
and sensory (auditory and visual) subnetworks, we used the
same
definitions
as the
functionally
defined
subnetworks.
Table 3 gives the region assignments for each of these seven
subnetworks.
(f) Multivariate pattern analysis for sex classification
We performed a multivariate analysis using a support vector
machine (SVM) classifier [50] to distinguish between males and
females using connectivity and behavioural measures. We treated
subnetwork and behavioural features (CNB scores) separately to
construct two different classifiers, each using only a single set of
features. The final unbiased estimate on the classification accuracy
of each classifier was calculated using a 10-fold cross-validation
procedure where the classifier was trained using 90% of the data
and tested on the rest, with the training and testing data being
changed for each fold. For the connectivity-based classifier, we
compiled the mean connectivity within and between 10 function-
ally defined subnetworks (auditory, cingulo-opercular, default
mode, dorsal attention, fronto-parietal, motor, subcortical, ventral
attention, visual and others), resulting in a 55 dimensional feature
set. For the behavioural classifier, we used 26 CNB scores and five
psychiatric evaluations. We repeated the experiments with differ-
ent age groups to identify the developmental differences in
separation between males and females. Finally, for each classifier,
we assigned each participant a classification score, quantifying the
certainty of assignment of a participant’s pattern of behaviour
or connectivity to their sex group, by measuring the distance of
the participant’s feature vector from the separating hyperplane
in SVM. We used these classification scores to calculate the
correlation between decisions of two classifiers.
(g) Statistical analysis
When comparing males and females on a single feature (e.g.
mean within subnetwork connectivity), we used a two-tailed
t-test. Ages of participants were compared between males and
females with no significant difference being found. Statistical
comparisons were considered significant if corrected p-values
were less than 0.05. The false discovery rate (FDR) correction
[51] was used for multiple comparisons correction. With com-
parison on structural connectivity, we used the total brain
volume as a covariate because it differed significantly between
males and females ( p , 0.01). Accuracy of a single multivariate
