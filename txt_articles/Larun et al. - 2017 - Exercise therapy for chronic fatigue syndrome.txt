Background
Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is characterised by persistent, medically unexplained fatigue, as well as symptoms such as musculoskele-
tal pain, sleep disturbance, headaches and impaired concentration and short-term memory. CFS presents as a common, debilitating
and serious health problem. Treatment may include physical interventions, such as exercise therapy, which was last reviewed in 2004.
Objectives
The objective of this review was to determine the effects of exercise therapy (ET) for patients with CFS as compared with any other
intervention or control.
• Exercise therapy versus ’passive control’ (e.g. treatment as usual, waiting-list control, relaxation, flexibility).
• Exercise therapy versus other active treatment (e.g. cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), cognitive treatment, supportive therapy,
pacing, pharmacological therapy such as antidepressants).
• Exercise therapy in combination with other specified treatment strategies versus other specified treatment strategies (e.g. exercise
combined with pharmacological treatment vs pharmacological treatment alone).
Search methods
We searched The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR), the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and SPORTDiscus up to May 2014 using a comprehensive list of free-text terms for
CFS and exercise. We located unpublished or ongoing trials through the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical
Trials Registry Platform (to May 2014). We screened reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field for additional
studies
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials involving adults with a primary diagnosis of CFS who were able to participate in exercise therapy. Studies
had to compare exercise therapy with passive control, psychological therapies, adaptive pacing therapy or pharmacological therapy.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessments and data extraction. We combined continuous
measures of outcomes using mean differences (MDs) and standardised mean differences (SMDs). We combined serious adverse reactions
and drop-outs using risk ratios (RRs). We calculated an overall effect size with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each outcome.

 Main results
We have included eight randomised controlled studies and have reported data from 1518 participants in this review. Three studies
diagnosed individuals with CFS using the 1994 criteria of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); five used the
Oxford criteria. Exercise therapy lasted from 12 to 26 weeks. Seven studies used variations of aerobic exercise therapy such as walking,
swimming, cycling or dancing provided at mixed levels in terms of intensity of the aerobic exercise from very low to quite rigorous,
whilst one study used anaerobic exercise. Control groups consisted of passive control (eight studies; e.g. treatment as usual, relaxation,
flexibility) or CBT (two studies), cognitive therapy (one study), supportive listening (one study), pacing (one study), pharmacological
treatment (one study) and combination treatment (one study). Risk of bias varied across studies, but within each study, little variation
was found in the risk of bias across our primary and secondary outcome measures.
Investigators compared exercise therapy with ’passive’ control in eight trials, which enrolled 971 participants. Seven studies consistently
showed a reduction in fatigue following exercise therapy at end of treatment, even though the fatigue scales used different scoring
systems: an 11-item scale with a scoring system of 0 to 11 points (MD -6.06, 95% CI -6.95 to -5.17; one study, 148 participants; low-
quality evidence); the same 11-item scale with a scoring system of 0 to 33 points (MD -2.82, 95% CI -4.07 to -1.57; three studies, 540
participants; moderate-quality evidence); and a 14-item scale with a scoring system of 0 to 42 points (MD -6.80, 95% CI -10.31 to -
3.28; three studies, 152 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Serious adverse reactions were rare in both groups (RR 0.99, 95% CI
0.14 to 6.97; one study, 319 participants; moderate-quality evidence), but sparse data made it impossible for review authors to draw
conclusions. Study authors reported a positive effect of exercise therapy at end of treatment with respect to sleep (MD -1.49, 95% CI
-2.95 to -0.02; two studies, 323 participants), physical functioning (MD 13.10, 95% CI 1.98 to 24.22; five studies, 725 participants)
and self-perceived changes in overall health (RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.40; four studies, 489 participants). It was not possible for
review authors to draw conclusions regarding the remaining outcomes.
Investigators compared exercise therapy with CBT in two trials (351 participants). One trial (298 participants) reported little or no
difference in fatigue at end of treatment between the two groups using an 11-item scale with a scoring system of 0 to 33 points (MD
0.20, 95% CI -1.49 to 1.89). Both studies measured differences in fatigue at follow-up, but neither found differences between the
two groups using an 11-item fatigue scale with a scoring system of 0 to 33 points (MD 0.30, 95% CI -1.45 to 2.05) and a nine-item
Fatigue Severity Scale with a scoring system of 1 to 7 points (MD 0.40, 95% CI -0.34 to 1.14). Serious adverse reactions were rare
in both groups (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.11 to 3.96). We observed little or no difference in physical functioning, depression, anxiety and
sleep, and we were not able to draw any conclusions with regard to pain, self-perceived changes in overall health, use of health service
resources and drop-out rate.
With regard to other comparisons, one study (320 participants) suggested a general benefit of exercise over adaptive pacing, and another
study (183 participants) a benefit of exercise over supportive listening. The available evidence was too sparse to draw conclusions about
the effect of pharmaceutical interventions.
Authors’ conclusions
Patients with CFS may generally benefit and feel less fatigued following exercise therapy, and no evidence suggests that exercise therapy
may worsen outcomes. A positive effect with respect to sleep, physical function and self-perceived general health has been observed, but
no conclusions for the outcomes of pain, quality of life, anxiety, depression, drop-out rate and health service resources were possible.
The effectiveness of exercise therapy seems greater than that of pacing but similar to that of CBT. Randomised trials with low risk of
bias are needed to investigate the type, duration and intensity of the most beneficial exercise intervention.

 Why is this review important?
Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is sometimes called myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME). Research estimates that between 2 in 1000
and 2 in 100 adults in the USA are affected by CFS. People with CFS often have long-lasting fatigue, joint pain, headaches, sleep
problems, and poor concentration and short-term memory. These symptoms cause significant disability and distress for people affected
by CFS. There is no clear medical cause for CFS, so people who are affected often deal with misunderstanding of their condition from
family, friends and healthcare professionals. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend exercise
therapy for individuals with CFS, and a previous review of the evidence suggested that exercise therapy was a promising approach to
the treatment. It is thought that exercise therapy can help management of CFS symptoms by helping people gradually reintroduce
physical activity into their daily lives.
This review is an update of a previous Cochrane review from 2004, which showed that exercise therapy was a promising treatment for
adults with CFS. Since the review, additional studies investigating the effectiveness and safety of exercise therapy for patients with CFS
have been published.
What questions does this review aim to answer?
• Is exercise therapy more effective than ‘passive’ treatments (e.g. waiting list, treatment as usual, relaxation, flexibility)?
• Is exercise therapy more effective than other ‘active’ therapies (e.g. cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), pacing, medication)?
• Is exercise therapy more effective when combined with another treatment than when given alone?
• Is exercise therapy safer than other treatments?
Which studies were included in the review?
We searched databases to find all high-quality studies of exercise therapy for CFS published up to May 2014. To be included in the
review, studies had to be randomised controlled trials and include adults over 18 years of age, more than 90% of whom had a clear
diagnosis of CFS. We included eight studies with a total of 1518 participants in the review. Seven studies used aerobic exercise therapy
such as walking, swimming, cycling or dancing; the remaining study used non-aerobic exercise. Most studies asked participants to
exercise at home, between three and five times per week, with a target duration of 5 to 15 minutes per session using different means of
incrementation.
What does evidence from the review tell us?
Moderate-quality evidence showed exercise therapy was more effective at reducing fatigue compared to ‘passive’ treatment or no
treatment. Exercise therapy had a positive effect on people’s daily physical functioning, sleep and self-ratings of overall health.
One study suggests that exercise therapy was more effective than pacing strategies for reducing fatigue. However exercise therapy was
no more effective than CBT.
Exercise therapy did not worsen symptoms for people with CFS. Serious side effects were rare in all groups, but limited information
makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the safety of exercise therapy.
Evidence was not sufficient to show effects of exercise therapy on pain, use of other healthcare services, or to allow assessment of rates
of drop-out from exercise therapy programmes.
What should happen next?
Researchers suggest that further studies should be carried out to discover what type of exercise is most beneficial for people affected by
CFS, which intensity is best, the optimal length, as well as the most beneficial delivery method.

of control.
dRisk of bias (0): This outcome is unlikely to have been affected by detection or performance bias.
eImprecision (-1): low numbers of events and wide confidence intervals.
f Imprecision (-2): very low numbers of participants and wide confidence intervals, which encompass benefit and harm.
gInconsistency (-1): variation in effect size and direction of effect across available studies.
hImprecision (-1): Confidence interval fails to exclude negligible differences in favour of the intervention.

Description of the condition
Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is an illness characterised by
persistent, medically unexplained fatigue. Symptoms include se-
vere, disabling fatigue, as well as musculoskeletal pain, sleep dis-
turbance, headaches, and impaired concentration and short-term
memory (Prins 2006). Individuals experience significant disability
and distress, which may be exacerbated by lack of understanding
from others, including healthcare professionals. The term ’myal-
gic encephalomyelitis (ME)’ is often used, but ’CFS’ is the term
that has been adopted and clearly defined for research purposes,
and it will be used in this review. The diagnosis can be made only
after all alternative diagnoses have been excluded (Reeves 2003;
Reeves 2007); several sets of criteria are currently used to diagnose
CFS (Carruthers 2011; Fukuda 1994; NICE 2007; Reeves 2003;
Sharpe 1991). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) 1994 diagnostic criteria for CFS (Fukuda 1994) are the
most widely cited for research purposes (Fonhus 2011), resulting
in prevalence of CFS of between 0.24% (Reyes 2003) and 2.55%
(Reeves 2007) among US adults. Practical application of diagnos-
tic criteria may help to explain some of the observed variation in
prevalence estimates (Johnston 2013). In practice, most patients
visit their local general practitioner (GP) for assessment. A minor-
ity of patients may be referred to specialist clinics (e.g. neurology,
infectious diseases, psychiatry, endocrinology or general medicine)
for exclusion of alternative underlying disorders.
Description of the intervention
Exercise therapy is often included as part of a treatment pro-
gramme for individuals with CFS. ’Exercise’ is defined as “planned
structured and repetitive bodily movement done to improve or
maintain one or more components of physical fitness” (ACSM
2001); ’therapy’ is defined as “treatment intended to relieve or heal
a disorder” (Oxford English Dictionary). We define ’exercise ther-
apy’ as a “regimen or plan of physical activity designed and pre-
scribed [and] intended to relieve or heal a disorder,” and ’therapeu-
tic exercise’ or ’exercise therapy’ can be described as “planned exer-
cise performed to attain a specific physical benefit, such as mainte-
nance of the range of motion, strengthening of weakened muscles,
increased joint flexibility, or improved cardiovascular and respira-
tory function” (Mosby 2009). Aerobic exercise such as walking,
jogging, swimming or cycling is included, along with anaerobic
exercise such as strength or stabilising exercises. Graded exercise
therapyischaracterisedbyestablishmentof abaseline of achievable
exercise or physical activity, followed by a negotiated, incremental
increase in the duration of time spent physically active followed
by an increase in intensity (White 2011).
How the intervention might work
Physical activity can improve health and quality of life for pa-
tients with chronic disease (Blair 2009). The causal pathway for
CFS is unknown; however several hypotheses have been proposed
as to why exercise therapy might be a viable treatment. The ’de-
conditioning model’ assumes that the syndrome is perpetuated
by reversible physiological changes of deconditioning and avoid-
ance of activity; therefore exercise should improve deconditioning
and thus the condition of patients with CFS (Clark 2005; White
2011). However, mediation studies suggest that improved con-
ditioning is not associated with better outcomes (Fulcher 1997;
Moss-Morris 2005). Some graded exercise therapy (GET) pro-
grammes are designed to gradually reintroduce the patient to the
avoidedstimulusof physical activityorexercise, which mayinvolve
a conditioned response leading to fatigue (Clark 2005; Fulcher
2000; White 2011). Mediation studies suggest that reduced symp-
tom focus may mediate outcomes with GET, consistent with this
model (Clark 2005; Moss-Morris 2005). Evidence has also been
found for central sensitisation contributing to hyperresponsive-
ness of the central nervous system to a variety of visceral inputs
(Nijs 2011). The most replicated finding in patients with CFS is an
increased sense of effort during exercise, which is consistent with
this model (Fulcher 2000; Paul 2001). Graded exercise therapy
may reduce this extra sense of effort, perhaps by reducing central
sensitisation (Fulcher 1997).
Further research is needed to verify these hypotheses, but effective
treatments may be discovered without knowledge of the effective
pathway or underlying cause.
Why it is important to do this review
The previous Cochrane review (Edmonds 2004) suggested that
exercise therapy was a promising treatment but that larger stud-
ies were needed to address the safety of this therapy (Edmonds
2004). Such studies have been completed and their findings pub-
lished, so that the present time is propitious for an updated re-
view. Exercise therapy is often used as treatment for individuals
with CFS and is recommended by treatment guidelines (NICE
2007). People with CFS should have the opportunity to make in-
formed decisions about their care and treatment based on robust
research evidence. This review will examine the effectiveness of
exercise therapy, provided as a stand-alone intervention or as part
of a treatment plan. The Cochrane Collaboration has reviewed
multiple aspects of treatment for patients with CFS. A review on
CBT was published in 2008 (Price 2008), and one on traditional
Chinese herbal medicine in 2009 (Adams 2009); also, a protocol
on pharmacological treatments was submitted (Hard 2009).
This review, which is an update of a Cochrane review first pub-
lished in 2004, will update the evidence base that serves as a re-
source for informed decision making by healthcare personnel and
patients. A protocol for an accompanying individual patient data

 review on chronic fatigue syndrome and exercise therapy has been
published (Larun 2014).
O B J E C T I V E S
The objective of this review was to determine the effects of exercise
therapy (ET) for patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) as
compared with any other intervention or control.
• Exercise therapy versus ’passive control’ (e.g. treatment as
usual, waiting-list control, relaxation, flexibility).
• Exercise therapy versus other active treatment (e.g.
cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), cognitive treatment,
supportive therapy, pacing, pharmacological therapy such as
antidepressants).
• Exercise therapy in combination with other specified
treatment strategies versus other specified treatment strategies
(e.g. exercise combined with pharmacological treatment vs
pharmacological treatment alone).

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We included randomised controlled trials, as well as cluster-ran-
domised trials and cross-over trials.
Types of participants
We included trials of male and female participants over the age
of 18, irrespective of cultures and settings. Investigators currrently
have used several sets of criteria to diagnose CFS (Carruthers 2011;
Fukuda 1994; NICE 2007; Reeves 2003; Sharpe 1991); therefore
we decided to include trials in which participants fulfilled the
following diagnostic criteria for CFS or ME.
• Fatigue, or a symptom synonymous with fatigue, was a
prominent symptom.
• Fatigue was medically unexplained (i.e. other diagnoses
known to cause fatigue such as anorexia nervosa or sleep apnoea
could be excluded).
• Fatigue was sufficiently severe to significantly disable or
distress the participant.
• Fatigue persisted for at least six months.
We included trials that included participants with disorders other
than CFS provided that > 90% of participants had been given a
primary diagnosis of CFS based on the criteria discussed above.
We included in the analysis of this review trials in which less than
90% of participants had a primary diagnosis of CFS only if data
on CFS were reported separately.
Co-morbidity
Studies involving participants with co-morbid physical or com-
mon mental disorders were eligible for inclusion only if the co-
morbidity did not provide an alternative explanation for fatigue.
Types of interventions
Experimental intervention
Both aerobic and anaerobic interventions aimed at exercising big
muscle groups, for example, walking, swimming, jogging and
strength or stabilising exercises, could be included. Both individ-
ual and group treatment modalities were eligible, but interven-
tions had to be clearly described and supported by appropriate
references.
’Exercise therapy’ is an umbrella term for the different types of
exercise provided; it is based on the American College of Sports
Medicine definition (ACSM 2001). We categorised exercise ther-
apies in this review in accordance with descriptions of the inter-
ventions provided by individual studies. We prepared a table of
Interventions with detailed information on exercise therapy re-
ported by the included studies, as definitions vary across time and
context. As a point of reference, we used the following empirical
definitions, as derived from descriptions of the interventions.
• Graded exercise therapy (GET): exercise in which the
incremental increase in exercise was mutually set.
• Exercise with pacing: exercise in which the incremental
increase in exercise was personally set.
• Anaerobic exercise: exercise that requires a high level of
exertion, in a brief spurt or short-term in duration by the
participant that can be gradually increased over time with
practice
We did not impose restrictions with regard to the duration of each
treatment session, the number of sessions or the time between ses-
sions. Trials presenting data from one of the following compar-
isons were eligible for inclusion.
Comparator interventions
• ‘Passive control’: treatment as usual/waiting-list control/
relaxation/flexibility.
◦ ’Treatment as usual’ comprises medical assessments
and advice given on a naturalistic basis. ’Relaxation’ consists of
techniques that aim to increase muscle relaxation (e.g. autogenic
8

 training, listening to a relaxation tape). ’Flexibility’ includes
stretches performed according to selected exercises given.
• Psychological therapies: cognitive-behavioural therapy
(CBT)/cognitive treatment/supportive therapy/behavioural
therapies/psychodynamic therapies.
• Adaptive pacing therapy.
• Pharmacological therapy (e.g. antidepressants).
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
1. Fatigue: measured using any validated scale (e.g. Fatigue Scale
(FS) (Chalder 1993), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) (Krupp 1989)).
2. Adverse outcomes: measured using any reporting system (e.g.
serious adverse reactions (SARs) (European Union Clinical Trials
Directive 2001)).
Secondary outcomes
3. Pain: measured using any validated scale (e.g. Brief Pain Inven-
tory (Cleeland 1994)).
4. Physical functioning: measured using any validated scale (e.g.
Short Form (SF)-36, physical functioning subscale (Ware 1992)).
5. Quality of life (QOL): measured using any validated scale (e.g.
Quality of Life Scale (Burckhardt 2003)).
6. Mood disorders: measured using validated instruments (e.g.
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (Zigmond 1983)).
7. Sleep duration and quality: measured by self-report on a val-
idated scale, or objectively by polysomnography (e.g. Pittsburgh
Sleep Quality Index (Buysse 1989)).
8. Self-perceivedchanges in overall health: measured by self-report
on a validated scale (e.g. Global Impression Scale (Guy 1976)).
9. Health service resource use (e.g. primary care consultation rate,
secondary care referral rate, use of alternative practitioners).
10. Drop-outs (any reason).
Timing of outcome assessment
We extracted from all studies data on each outcome for end of
treatment and end of follow-up.
Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
The Cochrane Collaboration’s Depression, Anxiety and Neuro-
sis (CCDAN) Review Group’s Trials Search Coordinator (TSC)
searched their Group’s Specialized Register (CCDANCTR-Stud-
ies and CCDANCTR-References) (all years to 9 May 2014). This
register is created from routine generic searches of MEDLINE
(1950- ), EMBASE (1974- ) and PsycINFO (1967- ). Details
of CCDAN’s generic search strategies, used to inform he CC-
DANCTR can be found on the Group‘s web site.
The CCDANCTR-Studies Register was searched using the fol-
lowing terms:
Diagnosis = (“Chronic Fatigue Syndrome” or fatigue) and Free
Text = (exercise or sport* or relaxation or “multi convergent” or
“tai chi”)
The CCDANCTR-References Register was searched using a more
sensitive list of free-text search terms to identify additional un-
tagged/uncoded references, e.g. fatigue*, myalgic encephalomyeli-
tis*, exercise, physical active* and taiji. Full search strategy listed
in Appendix 1.
A complementary search of the following bibliographic databases
and international trial registers were also conducted to 9 May 2014
(see Appendix 2):
• SPORTSDiscus (1985 - );
• The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL, all years -); and
• WHO International Clinical Trials Portal.
Searching other resources
We contacted the authors of included studies and screened ref-
erence lists to identify additional published or unpublished data.
We conducted citation searches using the Institute for Scientific
Information (ISI) Science Citation Index on the Web of Science.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two of three review authors (LL, JO-J, KGB) inspected identified
studies, using eligibility criteria to select relevant studies. In cases
of disagreement, they consulted a third review author (JRP).
Data extraction and management
Melissa Edmonds and Jonatahan R Price independently extracted
data from included studies for the 2004 version of this review,
and LL and JO-J did so for this review update, using a standard-
ised extraction sheet. They extracted mean scores at endpoint,
the standard deviation (SD) or standard error (SE) of these val-
ues and the number of participants included in these analyses.
When only the SE was reported, review authors converted it to the
SD. For dichotomous outcomes, such as drop-outs, we extracted
the number of events. We sought clarification from trial authors
when necessary from investigators involved in the following tri-
als: Fulcher 1997, Moss-Morris 2005, Wallman 2004, Wearden
2009, Wearden 2010 and White 2011. We resolved disagreement
between review authors by discussion.

 Main comparisons
• Exercise therapy versus ’passive control’.
• Exercise therapy versus psychological treatment.
• Exercise therapy versus adaptive pacing therapy.
• Exercise therapy versus pharmacological therapy (e.g.
antidepressants).
• Exercise therapy as an adjunct to other treatment versus
other treatment alone.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Working independently, LL and JO-J, KGB or Jane Dennis (JD)
assessed risk of bias using The Cochrane Collaboration risk of
bias tool which was published in the most recent version of the
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins
2011). This tool encourages consideration of how the sequence
was generated, how allocation was concealed, the integrity of
blinding at outcome, the completeness of outcome data, selective
reporting and other potential sources of bias. We classified all items
in the risk of bias assessment as low risk, high risk or unclear risk
by the extent to which bias was prevented.
Measures of treatment effect
Continuous data
For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference
(MD) when the same scale was used in a similar manner across
studies. When results for continuous outcomes were presented us-
ing different scales or different versions of the same scale, we used
the standardised mean difference (SMD).
Dichotomous data
For dichotomous outcomes, we expressed effect size in terms of
risk ratio (RR).
Unit of analysis issues
Studies with multiple treatment groups
We extracted data from relevant arms of the included studies, and
we compared the experimental condition (exercise therapy) versus
each individual comparator intervention: ‘Passive control’ (treat-
ment as usual/waiting-list control/relaxation/flexibility); ’Psycho-
logical treatment’ (cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT)/cogni-
tive treatment/supportive therapy/behavioural therapies/psycho-
dynamic therapies); ’Adaptive pacing therapy; and Pharmacolog-
ical therapy (e.g. antidepressants). This meant that data from the
exercise arm could be included in a separate univariate analysis
for more than one comparison. We described under Differences
between protocol and review planned methods that were found
redundant, as we did not include studies requiring their use.
Dealing with missing data
When possible, we calculated missing standard deviations from
reported standard errors, P values or confidence limits using the
methods described in Chapter 7 (Sections 7.7.3.2 and 7.7.3.3)
of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions
(Higgins 2011). We approached trial investigators to obtain other
types of missing data.
Assessment of heterogeneity
For this update, we assessed heterogeneity in keeping with the rec-
ommendations of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of
Interventions (I2 values of 0 to 40%: might not be important; 30%
to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity; 50% to 90%: may
represent substantial heterogeneity; 75% to 100%: show consid-
erable heterogeneity; Higgins 2011). In addition to the I2 value
(Higgins 2003), we present the P value of the Chi2 test, and we
considered the direction and magnitude of treatment effects when
making judgements about statistical heterogeneity. We deemed
that no analyses were inappropriate as a result of the presence of
statistical heterogeneity, as the measures and statistics used have
low power and are unstable when based on few and small studies.
A P value < 0.1 from the Chi2 test was used as an indicator of
statistically significant heterogeneity because of the low power of
provided measures.
Assessment of reporting biases
We planned at the protocol stage to construct funnel plots when
sufficient numbers of trials allowed a meaningful presentation, to
establish whether other potential biases could be present. Asym-
metry of these plots may indicate publication bias, although it
also may represent a true relationship between trial size and effect
size. We identified an insufficient number of studies to use this
approach in the present version of the review (Egger 1997). We
considered clinical diversity of the studies as a possible explanation
for some of the heterogeneity apparent between studies.
Data synthesis
As the result of expected clinical heterogeneity (slightly different
interventions, populations and comparators) among studies, we
chose the random-effects model as the default method of analysis
because the alternative fixed-effect model assumes that the true
treatment effect in each trial is the same, and that observed differ-
ences are due to chance.
We performed analyses using Review Manager 5.0.

 Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We planned no subgroup analyses a priori. To explore possible dif-
ferences between studies that used different strategies (e.g. exercise
therapy), control conditions and diagnostic criteria, we performed
post hoc subgroup analyses. We describe results of these subgroup
analyses in the text of the review.
Sensitivity analysis
We planned no sensitivity analyses a priori. To explore the possible
impact of our pooling strategy (e.g. the impact of using SMD vs
MD), we performed post hoc sensitivity analyses. In addition, we
performed sensitivity analyses when studies with outlying results
where excluded. We describe results of these sensitivity analyses in
the text of the review.

 Included studies
A total of eight studies (Fulcher 1997; Jason 2007; Moss-Morris
2005; Powell 2001; Wallman 2004; Wearden 1998; Wearden
2010; White 2011) met our inclusion criteria for this review (23
reports in all). All included studies were written in English and
were published in peer-reviewed journals.
Design
All includedstudieswere describedasrandomisedcontrolledtrials.
Three studies included two arms (Fulcher 1997; Moss-Morris
2005; Wallman 2004) comparing exercise versus relaxation/flexi-
bility, waiting list or standard care, respectively.
Four studies had four arms. For Powell 2001, we combined the
three intervention arms and used these as comparators versus treat-
ment as usual. We considered two arms (exercise + drug placebo vs
exercise placebo + drug placebo) in Wearden 1998 as relevant for
this review. For Jason 2007 and White 2011, all four arms were
used, as were three arms in Wearden 2010.
The eight studies randomly assigned a total of 1518 participants.
Samples included in this review ranged from 49 (Moss-Morris
2005) to 641 participants (White 2011).
Setting
Two studies took place in primary care settings: one in the United
Kingdom (Wearden 2010) and one in Australia (Wallman 2004).
Two studies were performed in secondary care facilities: one in
the United Kingdom (Fulcher 1997) and one in New Zealand
(Moss-Morris 2005). One study recruited from a variety of sources
but took place at a hospital in the USA (Jason 2007). Three studies
were conducted at secondary/tertiary care settings in the United
Kingdom (Powell 2001; Wearden 1998; White 2011).
Participants
Three studies used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) 1994 criteria (Fukuda 1994) as inclusion criteria (Jason
2007; Moss-Morris 2005; Wallman 2004), andfive (Fulcher 1997;
Powell 2001; Wearden 1998; Wearden 2010; White 2011) used
the Oxford criteria (Sharpe 1991). Wearden 2010 and White 2011
showed an overlap between Oxford criteria (Sharpe 1991) and
London ME criteria (The National Task Force on CFS) of 31%
and 51%, respectively. More female than male participants were
included (range 71% to 84% when all arms were included), and
mean ages across studies were between 33 and 44.6 years (confir-
mation of age data was requested from a trial investigator in one
case (Wallman 2009)). The studies reported median illness dura-
tion of between 2.3 and 7 years. All but one study (Wallman 2004)
reported depression, which ranged from 18% (Wearden 2010) of
those with a depression diagnosis to 39% among participants with
a current Axis I disorder (Jason 2007). Three studies did not report
work and employment information (Wallman 2004; Wearden
2010; White 2011). Fulcher 1997 and Jason 2007 reported that
39% and 46% of participants were working or studying on at
least a part-time basis, 22% of participants in Moss-Morris 2005
were unemployed and were unable to work because of disability
and 42% of participants in Powell 2001 were receiving disability
pensions (Table 1).
Intervention characteristics
The exercise therapy regimen lasted between 12 and 26 weeks.
Seven studies used variations of aerobic exercise therapy such as
walking, swimming, cycling or dancing at mixed levels in terms of
intensity of the aerobic activity ranging from very low to quite rig-
orous; the remaining study used anaerobic exercise (Jason 2007).
Scheduled therapist meetings could be conducted face-to-face or
by telephone and varied from every second week to weekly; some
sessions involved talking, and some exercise. Most of the included
studies asked participants to exercise at home, most often between
three and five times per week, with a target duration of 5 to 15 min-
utes per session using different means of incrementation (Fulcher
1997; Moss-Morris 2005; Powell 2001; Wallman 2004; Wearden
1998; Wearden 2010; White 2011). Participants were asked to
perform self-monitoring by using such tools as heart monitors, the
Borg Scale or a diary including an exercise log to measure adher-
ence to treatment (Table 2). Control interventions included treat-
ment as usual, relaxation plus flexibility and a waiting-list control
group.
Outcomes
The mainoutcomeswere symptomlevelsmeasuredbyrating scales
at end of treatment (12 to 26 weeks) and at follow-up (52 to 70
weeks). Fatigue was measured by the Fatigue Scale (FS) (Chalder
1993) in seven studies (Fulcher 1997; Moss-Morris 2005; Powell
2001; Wallman 2004; Wearden 1998; Wearden 2010; White
2011) and by the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) (Krupp 1989) in
one study (Jason 2007). Another study (White 2011) reported
adverse outcomes according to SAR categories (European Union
Clinical Trials Directive 2001).
The Jason 2007 study measured pain using the Brief Pain Inven-
tory (Cleeland 1994). Physical functioning was measured by the
SF-36 physical functioning subscale (Ware 1992) in seven stud-
ies (Fulcher 1997; Jason 2007; Moss-Morris 2005; Powell 2001;
Wearden 1998; Wearden 2010; White 2011). Quality of life was
measured by the Quality of Life Scale (QOLS) (Burckhardt 2003)
in another study (Jason 2007).

 Seven studies (Fulcher 1997; Jason 2007; Moss-Morris 2005;
Powell 2001; Wallman 2004; Wearden 2010; White 2011) re-
ported self-perceived changes in overall health using the Global
Impression Scale (Guy 1976).
Of the seven studies that reported mood disorder, six (Fulcher
1997; Powell 2001; Wallman 2004; Wearden 1998; Wearden
2010; White 2011) used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression
Scale (HADS) (Zigmond 1983), and one (Jason 2007) used the
Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) (Beck 1996) and the Beck
Anxiety Inventory (BAI) (Hewitt 1993). Three studies (Powell
2001; Wearden 2010; White 2011) measured sleep problems by
using a questionnaire (Jenkins 1988), two (Fulcher 1997; Powell
2001) by using the Pittburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (Buysse
1989).
One study reported health service resource use (White 2011).
Drop-out was calculated by the review authors.
Included studies reported several outcomes in addition to those
reported in this review, such as work capacity by oxygen consump-
tion (VO2), the six-minute walking test and illness beliefs. See
Characteristics of included studies for more detailed information.
Ethics approval
Ethics approval was obtained for all listed studies and sponsoring
or funding listed.
Excluded studies
Two studies were excluded in 2004, as the diagnoses used were
Gulf War veterans’ illness (Guarino 2001) and subclinical chronic
fatigue (Ridsdale 2004). The study awaiting assessment from 2004
was also excluded (Stevens 1999), as exercise therapy was a minor
part of a combination treatment.
The current version excluded 14 studies (Evering 2008; Gordon
2010; Guarino 2001; Nunez 2011; Ridsdale 2004; Ridsdale 2012;
Russel 2001; Stevens 1999; Taylor 2004; Taylor 2006; Thomas
2008; Tummers 2012; Viner 2004; Wright 2005). In addition to
the two studies excluded from the 2004 version because of the
populationincluded(Guarino 2001; Ridsdale 2004), anotherwith
the diagnosis of chronic fatigue was excluded (Ridsdale 2012),
as were two in which participants were younger than 18 years
(Viner 2004; Wright 2005). Along with the one study excluded in
2004 (Stevens 1999), another five studies (Evering 2008; Nunez
2011; Russel 2001; Taylor 2004; Tummers 2012) were excluded
in this review update because exercise therapy was a minor part
of the intervention. One study was excluded because investigators
compared two exercise interventions (Gordon 2010). Two studies
were excluded because they were not RCTs (Taylor 2006; Thomas
2008).
Ongoing studies
We identified five ongoing studies in trial registers (Broadbent
2012; Kos 2012; Marques 2012; Vos-Vromans 2008; White
2012).
Studies awaiting classification
Studies identified from searches run to 9 May 2014 were assessed
for eligibility and were classified accordingly. Three studies iden-
tified in the search are waiting assessment for possible inclusion,
as the available information is too sparse for conclusions about
eligibility. One abstract seems to refer to an unpublished study
(Hatcher 1998), but we have not been able to contact the study
authors for clarification. Additionally, two citations refer to studies
that are available only in Chinese (Liu 2010; Zhuo 2007). Again,
we have not been able to contact the study authors to clarify their
relevance, and we have not had the resources to perform transla-
tion.
New studies found at this update
Three new studies have been added in this updated review (Jason
2007; Wearden 2010; White 2011).
Risk of bias in included studies
Summaries of the risk of bias assessments are presented in Figure

percentages across all included studies.
Allocation
All but one of the studies had adequate sequence generation
(Wallman 2004). We judged five reported methods of alloca-
tion concealment as ’adequate’ and found that methods described
by the remaining three were unclear (Jason 2007; Powell 2001;
Wallman 2004).
Blinding
As the intervention did not allow for blinding of participants or
personnel delivering the exercise-based interventions, and as all
measures were performed by self-report, blinding was impossible.
This inevitably puts the review at some risk of bias, and all of the
included studies were rated as having high risk of bias.
Incomplete outcome data
Risk of bias due to incomplete outcomes was low in five of the eight
included studies, reflecting the fact that loss to follow-up was low,
and that participants who were lost to follow-up were evenly dis-
tributed between intervention and control groups (Fulcher 1997;
Moss-Morris 2005; Powell 2001; Wallman 2004; White 2011).
One trial wasassociatedwith unclearriskof attritionbias(Wearden
2010). The drop-out rate in the intervention groups in this trial
was relatively high, but most of the participants who dropped out
from treatment were still available for follow-up assessments and
were analysed within the groups to which they were randomly as-
signed (Wearden 2010). Two trials were associated with high risk
of attrition bias (Jason 2007; Wearden 1998). Wearden 1998 re-
ported large drop-out rates in all intervention groups as compared
with control groups, and many participants were lost to follow-up.
In Jason 2007, the conservatively defined drop-out rate (i.e. “at-
tending four or fewer sessions or stopping therapy prior to satisfac-
tory completion of therapy”) on average was 25%. Study authors
used the best linear unbiased predictor to avoid taking missing
data into account, but as loss to follow-up for various intervention
groups was not reported, we assessed the risk of attrition bias as
high for this trial.
Selective reporting
Two studies (Wearden 2010; White 2011) referenced published
protocols, and when we checked these against the published
results, we found that reporting was adequate. In one study
(Wearden 1998), trial investigators reported numerical data for
only one subscale (health perception) of the Medical Outcomes
Survey (MOS) scale (Ware 1992), for which data favour the in-
tervention group; no numerical data were given for the five other
subscales, nor for another scale (anxiety), as data were “similar in
trial completers.” It was not possible to check the other studies for
selective reporting bias; therefore their risk of bias is considered
unclear.
Other potential sources of bias
Seven of the eight studies seem to be free of other sources of bias,
and one showed a baseline difference across groups for several
16

 variables (Jason 2007). These were not discussed when results were
presented in the paper. In addition this study had 25 outcome
measures; because of this large number, one significant measure
would be expected to occur by chance (Jason 2007). Wallman
2004 showed differences between groups for anxiety and mental
fatigue at baseline, and this might have influenced the results.

Exercise therapy versus control
Comparison 1. Exercise therapy versus treatment as usual,
relaxation or flexibility
All included studies (Fulcher 1997; Jason 2007; Moss-Morris
2005; Powell 2001; Wallman 2004; Wearden 1998; Wearden
2010; White 2011) contributed data for this comparison.
1.1 Fatigue
Powell 2001 (148 participants) assessed fatigue by dichotomised
scoring of an 11-item Fatigue Scale (FS, 0 to 11 points) (Chalder
1993) and reported results clearly in favour of exercise therapy
(mean difference (MD) -6.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) -6.95
to -5.17; Analysis 1.1). Three studies (Wallman 2004; Wearden
2010; White 2011) measured fatigue among a total of 540 partic-
ipants using the same 11-item FS with a different scoring system
(0 to 33 points) (Chalder 1993) (Analysis 1.1). The pooled esti-
mate suggests that exercise therapy was significantly more effective
than treatment as usual (MD -2.82, 95% CI -4.07 to -1.57) - a
result that was not associated with heterogeneity (I² = 0%, P value
0.54). Three studies (Fulcher 1997; Moss-Morris 2005; Wearden
1998) with a total of 152 participants measured fatigue using a
14-item FS (0 to 42 points) (Chalder 1993). Pooling shows a sig-
nificant decrease in fatigue in the exercise group when compared
with treatment as usual (MD -6.80 points, 95% CI -10.31 to -
3.28), and the analysis was associated with low heterogeneity (I²
= 20%, P value 0.29).
At follow-up, small strengthening of the effect was observed on the
11-point FS (Chalder 1993) as reported by Powell 2001 (MD -
7.13, 95% CI -7.97 to -6.29; 148 participants; Analysis 1.2). Pool-
ing of the two studies (Wearden 2010; White 2011) that measured
fatigue on the 33-point scale resulted in almost the same effect
estimate at follow-up as at end of treatment (MD -2.87, 95% CI
-4.18 to -1.55; 472 participants; Analysis 1.2). The latter analysis
was not associated with any unexplained heterogeneity (I² = 0%,
P value 0.46). Jason 2007 (50 participants) did not report results
at end of treatment but showed little or no difference in fatigue
between anaerobic exercise and treatment as usual at follow-up, as
measured on the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) (Krupp 1989) (MD
0.15, 95% CI -0.55 to 0.85; Analysis 1.2).
Sensitivity analysis
Investigating heterogeneity
At end of treatment, fatigue was measured and reported on dif-
ferent scales, and we performed a sensitivity analysis in which all
available studies were pooled using an SMD method. This strategy
led to a pooled random-effects estimate of -0.68 (95% CI -1.02 to
-0.35), but the analysis suffered from considerable heterogeneity
(I² = 78%, P value < 0.0001; Analysis 1.19). The observed het-
erogeneity was caused mainly by the deviating results presented
in Powell 2001. Exclusion of Powell 2001 gave rise to a pooled
SMD of -0.46 (95% CI -0.63 to -0.29) - an estimate that was not
associated with heterogeneity (I² = 13%, P value 0.33).
At follow-up, the four available studies (Jason 2007; Powell 2001;
Wearden 2010; White 2011) measured and reported fatigue on
different scales, and we performed a sensitivity analysis in which all
available studies were pooled using an SMD method. The pooled
SMD estimate is -0.63 (95% CI -1.32 to 0.06), but heterogeneity
was extensive (I² = 93%, P value < 0.00001). Exclusion of Powell
2001 gave rise to a new pooled SMD of -0.29 (95% CI -0.55 to
-0.03) and reduced heterogeneity (I² = 46%, P value 0.16).
Subgroup analysis
To explore the possible impact of our pooling strategy (e.g. the
impact of pooling studies adhering to different exercise strategies
and control conditions), we performed post hoc subgroup analyses
within Analysis 1.1 and Analysis 1.2.
Type of exercise
Post hoc subgroup analysis based on treatment strategy could not
establish differences (I² = 0%, P value 0.60) between studies of
graded exercise therapy (Fulcher 1997; Moss-Morris 2005; Powell
2001; Wearden 1998; Wearden 2010; White 2011) and studies
testing exercise with self-pacing (Wallman 2004) (SMD -0.71,
95% CI -1.09 to -0.32; I² = 82% vs SMD -0.54, 95% CI -1.05
to -0.02, respectively) (Analysis 1.19).
At follow-up, post hoc subgroup analysis resulted in statistically
significant subgroup differences (I² = 73.7%, P value 0.05) be-
tween the three studies (Powell2001; Wearden 2010; White 2011)
comparing graded exercise versus treatment as usual (SMD -0.86,
95% CI -1.67 to -0.05; I² = 95%) and Jason 2007, in which anaer-
obic activity was compared with relaxation (SMD 0.12, 95% CI
-0.44 to 0.67).
Type of control
We cannot establish a subgroup difference (I² = 0%, P value 0.88)
between the five studies with treatment as usual as control (Moss-
Morris 2005; Powell 2001; Wearden 1998; Wearden 2010; White
2011) and the two studies prescribing relaxation or flexibility to
17

 participants in the control arm (Fulcher 1997; Wallman 2004)
(SMD -0.70, 95% CI -1.14 to -0.25 vs SMD -0.65, 95% CI -
1.02 to -0.28).
Diagnostic criteria
As the use of various diagnostic criteria is often emphasised as
particularly important with regard to treatment response, we also
performed subgroup analyses based on diagnostic criteria. Com-
parison of the two studies using 1994 CDC criteria (Moss-Morris
2005; Wallman 2004) and the five studies using the Oxford crite-
ria (Fulcher 1997; Powell 2001; Wearden 1998; Wearden 2010;
White 2011) revealed no differences between subgroups (I² = 0%,
P value 0.84) (SMD -0.73, 95% CI -1.17 to -0.28 vs SMD -0.66,
95% CI -1.09 to -0.24).
1.2 Adverse effects
White 2011 reported two serious adverse reactions (SARs) (
European Union Clinical Trials Directive 2001) possibly related
to treatment among the 160 participants (i.e. deterioration in mo-
bility and self-care and worse CFS symptoms and function) in
the exercise group and two SARs among the 159 participants in
the control group (i.e. worse CFS symptoms and function and
increased depression and incapacity) (odds ratio (OR) 0.99, 95%
CI 0.14 to 7.1; Analysis 1.3). Participants in the Wearden 2010
trial reported no SARs to therapy.
1.3 Pain
Wearden 1998 reported that all treated groups scored similarly on
the pain subscale of SF-36 (Ware 1992), but measured values were
not reported.
One trial, Jason 2007 (43 participants), assessed pain using the
Brief Pain Inventory (Cleeland 1994) at follow-up (Analysis 1.4)
and observed an MD of -0.97 (95% CI -2.44 to 0.50) on pain
severity and -0.69 on the pain interference subscale (95% CI -
2.48 to 1.10). The wide confidence interval implies that the results
were inconclusive.
1.4 Physical functioning
Five trials (Fulcher 1997; Moss-Morris 2005; Powell 2001;
Wearden 2010; White 2011) with a total of 725 participants as-
sessed physical functioning according to the physical functioning
subscale of SF-36 (Ware 1992) at end of treatment. The pooled
estimate for these studies (Analysis 1.5) suggests that mean im-
provement for participants randomly assigned to exercise therapy
was 13.10 points higher (95% CI 1.98 to 24.22) than for the
treatment as usual group, but heterogeneity was considerable (I²
= 89%, P value < 0.00001).
Four trials (669 participants) contributed data for evaluation
of physical functioning at follow-up (Jason 2007; Powell 2001;
Wearden 2010; White 2011). Jason 2007 observed better results
among participants in the relaxation group (MD 21.48, 95% CI
5.81 to 37.15). However, results were distorted by large baseline
differences in physical functioning between the exercise and re-
laxation groups (39/100 vs 54/100); therefore we decided not to
include these results in the meta-analysis. Pooling of the three
remaining trials (621 participants) showed a mean improvement
on the SF-36 physical functioning subscale that was 16.33 points
higher for exercise than for treatment as usual (95% CI -4.08 to
36.74; Analysis 1.6), but heterogeneity was excessive (I² = 96%, P
value < 0.00001); therefore little or no difference cannot be ruled
out.
Sensitivity analysis
Investigating heterogeneity
Extensive heterogeneity in Analysis 1.5 was largely driven by the
remarkably positive effect of exercise therapy reported by Powell
2001. Heterogeneity (I²) dropped to 52% (P value 0.10) following
exclusion of Powell 2001, and the pooled mean difference still
showed better improvement for participants in the exercise group
(MD 7.37, 95% CI 1.23 to 13.51). The remaining heterogeneity
may reflect the large variation in baseline physical functioning
observed across studies, ranging from 29.8 (Wearden 2010) to
53.1 (Moss-Morris 2005), but the number of available studies was
low; it is therefore difficult to explore this association further.
Also at follow-up, observed heterogeneity was driven by remark-
ably positive results in favour of exercise as reported by Powell
2001. If Powell 2001 was excluded, heterogeneity dropped to 0%
(Pvalue 0.50), andthe tworemainingtrials(Wearden 2010;White
2011) reported a smaller but statistically significant difference in
favour of exercise therapy (MD -5.79, 95% CI -10.53 to -1.06).
Subgroup analysis
To explore the possible impact of varying exercise strategies and
control conditions, we performed post hoc subgroup analyses
within Analysis 1.5 and Analysis 1.6.
Type of exercise
All studies included in Analysis 1.5 and Analysis 1.6 offered graded
exercise therapy. Jason 2007 observed better results among partic-
ipants in the relaxation group than among those in the anaerobic
exercise group (MD 21.48, 95% CI 5.81 to 37.15) at follow-up.
As stated above, these results were distorted by large baseline dif-
ferences in physical functioning between exercise and relaxation
groups (39 of 100 vs 54 of 100) and were not included in Analysis
1.6.
Type of control
At end of treatment, post hoc subgroup analysis did not establish
a subgroup difference (I² = 0%, P value 0.92) between the four
studies (Moss-Morris 2005; Powell 2001; Wearden 2010; White
2011) using treatment as usual as control (MD -12.96, 95% CI -
26.63 to 0.72; I² = 92%) and Fulcher 1997, in which relaxation
18

 or flexibility was used as a control (MD -13.87, 95% CI -24.31
to -3.43). All studies available for analysis at follow-up adhered
to the treatment as usual control condition, hence no sensitivity
analyses were performed within Analysis 1.6.
Diagnostic criteria
We found no evidence of subgroup differences (I² = 0%, P value
0.91) between one study diagnosing participants according to the
1994 CDC criteria (MD -14.05, 95% CI -27.48 to -0.62; Moss-
Morris 2005) and four studies diagnosing participants according
to the Oxford criteria (MD -12.92, 95% CI -25.99 to 0.14). All
studies available for analysis at follow-up recruited participants in
keeping with the Oxford criteria, thus no sensitivity analyses were
performed within Analysis 1.6.
1.5 Quality of life
None of the included studies reported quality of life at end of
treatment. At follow-up, an estimate of effect suggested improve-
ment towards better quality of life (Burckhardt 2003) among par-
ticipants in the control group (MD 9.00, 95% CI -1.00 to 19.00;
P value 0.08) compared with those given exercise therapy (Jason
2007; Analysis 1.7; 44 participants), but little or no effect cannot
be ruled out. This estimate is biased in favour of the control arm
because of baseline differences between groups.
1.6.1 Depression
Five studies (Fulcher 1997; Powell 2001; Wallman 2004; Wearden
1998; Wearden 2010) with a total of 504 participants contributed
information on depression at end of treatment (12 to 26 weeks),
all utilising the depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and
Depression Scale (HADS) (Zigmond 1983). Pooling study results
yielded an estimate of effect that suggested improvement in de-
pression scores among participants allocated to exercise therapy
compared with controls (MD 1.6 points, 95% CI -0.23 to 3.5;
Analysis 1.8), but the results were highly heterogeneous (I² = 84%,
P value < 0.0001), and little or no difference cannot be ruled out.
At follow-up (Analysis 1.9), Jason 2007 (45 participants) assessed
depression using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) (Beck
1996) and observed no difference in depression scores (MD 3.44,
95% CI -3.00 to 9.88)-an estimate that favours controls because of
baseline differences between groups. Three trials reported HADS
depression subscale values (Zigmond 1983) at follow-up (Powell
2001; Wearden 2010; White 2011; 609 participants). The pooled
estimate of effect suggests that exercise therapy improved depres-
sion more than treatment as usual (MD -2.26, 95% CI -5.09 to
0.56), but heterogeneity was considerable (I² = 92%, P value <
0.00001), and little or no difference cannot be ruled out.
Sensitivity analysis
Investigating heterogeneity
At end of treatment, Powell 2001 again reported very positive
resultsandcontributedgreatlytothe total heterogeneity.Exclusion
of Powell 2001 led to a reduction in observed effect size (MD 0.80,
95% CI -0.21 to 1.82), but heterogeneity was also greatly reduced
(I² = 36%, P value 0.20).
Also at follow-up, Powell 2001 reported a substantial benefit of
exercise therapycomparedwith resultsdescribedbythe othertrials.
Exclusion of Powell 2001 from the meta-analysis was associated
with a great reduction in heterogeneity, as I² dropped from 92%
to 9% (P value 0.30). Exclusion of Powell 2001 was also associated
with a change in the observed effect estimate (MD -0.77, 95% CI
-1.64 to 0.09). Hence, we still see an effect estimate suggesting
modest benefit associated with exercise therapy, but little or no
difference cannot be ruled out.
Standardised mean difference (SMD)
At longer-term follow-up, depression was measured and reported
on different measurement scales; therefore we performed a sen-
sitivity analysis in which all available studies were pooled using
an SMD method. The four available studies (Jason 2007; Powell
2001; Wearden 2010; White 2011) yielded a pooled standardised
estimate of SMD -0.35 (95% CI -0.93 to 0.23) in an analysis that
was associated with considerable heterogeneity (I² = 91%, P value
< 0.00001).
Subgroup analysis
To explore the possible impact of varying exercise strategies and
control conditions, we performed post hoc subgroup analyses
within Analysis 1.8 and Analysis 1.9.
Type of exercise
No statistical subgroup differences (I² = 0%, P value 0.75) were
observed between the four studies offering graded exercise therapy
(Fulcher 1997; Powell 2001; Wearden 1998; Wearden 2010) and
Wallman 2004, which offered exercise with personal pacing.
At longer-term follow-up, four available studies (Jason 2007;
Powell 2001; Wearden 2010; White 2011) provided a pooled stan-
dardised estimate of SMD -0.35 (95% CI -0.93 to 0.23) in an
analysis that was associated with considerable heterogeneity (I² =
91%, P value < 0.00001). Post hoc subgroup analysis resulted in
a statistically significant subgroup difference (I² = 71.2%, P value
0.06) between the three studies (Powell 2001; Wearden 2010;
White 2011) comparing graded exercise therapy versus treatment
as usual (SMD -0.53, 95% CI -1.20 to 0.13) and Jason 2007,
which compared anaerobic activity versus relaxation (SMD 0.31,
95% CI -0.28 to 0.90).
Type of control
At end of treatment, the post hoc subgroup analysis did not es-
tablish a subgroup difference (I² = 0%, P value 0.61) between the
three studies (Powell 2001; Wearden 1998; Wearden 2010) us-
ing treatment as usual as the control (MD -2.01, 95% CI -5.12
to 1.10; I² = 91%) and the two studies (Fulcher 1997; Wallman
2004) using relaxation or flexibility as the control (MD -1.05,
95% CI -2.95 to 0.84; I² = 59%).
1.6.2 Anxiety
19
Exercise therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome (Review)
Copyright © 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Five trials (Fulcher 1997; Powell 2001; Wallman 2004; Wearden
1998; Wearden 2010) assessed anxiety at end of treatment using
the anxiety subscale of the HADS (Zigmond 1983). Three studies
(387 participants) reported data in a way that facilitated compar-
ison in a meta-analysis (Powell 2001; Wallman 2004; Wearden
2010), resulting in a pooled MD of -1.48 points (95% CI -3.58 to
0.61; Analysis 1.10). The meta-analysis was associated with het-
erogeneity (I² = 79%, P value 0.008), but some of this hetero-
geneity can be explained by uncorrected baseline differences in
HADS anxiety score in included trials. Wearden 1998 (68 par-
ticipants) stated that no significant changes were observed on the
HADS anxiety score at end of treatment. Fulcher 1997 (58 partic-
ipants) did not observe changes in median HADS anxiety score in
the exercise group, whereas an increase in median HADS anxiety
score from 4 to 7 was observed in the control group. However,
the difference between exercise and control groups did not reach
statistical significance in non-parametric statistical analysis.
Four trials assessed anxiety at longer-term follow-up (52 to 70
weeks; Analysis 1.11). Jason 2007 (45 participants) reported a
mean difference on the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) (Beck 1996)
of 0.70 points (95% CI -4.52 to 5.92), and the wide confidence in-
terval implies inconclusive results. Three trials (607 participants)
assessed follow-up changes in anxiety using the HADS anxiety
subscale (Powell 2001; Wearden 2010; White 2011). The pooled
MD suggests greater improvement in HADS anxiety score in the
exercise group compared with the group given treatment as usual
(MD 1.01, 95% CI -0.74 to 2.75), but heterogeneity was consid-
erable (I² = 78%, P value 0.01), and little or no difference cannot
be ruled out.
Sensitivity analysis
Investigating heterogeneity
At follow-up, Powell 2001 reported very positive results and con-
tributed to increased heterogeneity. Exclusion of Powell 2001 re-
duced heterogeneity to 63% (P value 0.10), and the pooled MD
for White 2011 and Wearden 2010 was reduced to 0.24 (95% CI
-1.27 to 1.74).
Standardised mean difference (SMD)
At longer-term follow-up, anxiety was measured and reported on
different measurement scales; therefore we performed a sensitivity
analysis in which all available studies were pooled using an SMD
method. Fouravailable studies(Jason 2007; Powell 2001; Wearden
2010; White2011)yieldedapooledstandardisedestimate of SMD
-0.17 (95% CI -0.50 to 0.15), but the analysis was associated with
heterogeneity (I² = 71%, P value 0.02).
Subgroup analysis
To explore the possible impact of varying exercise strategies and
control conditions, we performed post hoc subgroup analyses
within Analysis 1.10 and Analysis 1.11.
Type of exercise and control
At end of treatment, post hoc subgroup analysis did not establish
a subgroup difference (I² = 0%, P value 0.64) between the two
studies (Powell 2001; Wearden 2010) comparing graded exercise
therapy versus treatment as usual (MD -1.22, 95% CI 0.-4.51
to 2.07; I² = 88%) and Wallman 2004, which compared exercise
with personal pacing versus flexibility and relaxation (MD -2.10,
95% CI -3.86 to -0.34).
At follow-up, four available studies (Jason 2007; Powell 2001;
Wearden 2010; White 2011) yielded a pooled standardised es-
timate of SMD -0.17 (95% CI -0.50 to 0.15), but the analysis
was associated with heterogeneity (I² = 71%, P value 0.02). We
could not establish a statistically significant subgroup difference
(I² = 0%, P value 0.40) between the three studies (Powell 2001;
Wearden 2010; White 2011) comparing graded exercise therapy
versus treatment as usual (SMD -0.23, 95% CI -0.61 to 0.16) and
Jason 2007, which compared anaerobic activity versus relaxation
(SMD 0.08, 95% CI -0.51 to 0.66).
1.7 Sleep
Two trials (Powell 2001; Wearden 2010), with a total of 323 par-
ticipants, suggested that sleep assessed by the Jenkins Sleep Scale
(Jenkins 1988) had improved more among participants in the ex-
ercise group at end of treatment (MD -1.49 points, 95% CI -2.95
to -0.02; P value 0.05; Analysis 1.12). Fulcher 1997, with 59 par-
ticipants at end of treatment, observed a reduction in median sleep
score, as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, from 7
to 5 in the exercise group, whereas median sleep score remained 6
in the control group; this group difference did not reach statistical
significance in non-parametric statistical analysis.
At follow-up, three included trials (Powell 2001; Wearden 2010;
White 2011)(610participants)showedeffectsinfavour of exercise
therapy when they were pooled (MD -2.04 points, 95% CI -3.48
to -0.23; P value 0.03; Analysis 1.13), but the three studies showed
heterogeneous results: a large positive effect in Powell 2001 (MD
-4.05, 95% CI -6.08 to -2.02) and a moderate effect in White
2011 (MD -2.00, 95% CI -3.84 to -0.23), with Wearden 2010
reporting no observed statistically significant differences between
the two groups (MD -0.31, 95% CI -1.97 to 1.35).
Subgroup analysis
All available studies compared graded exercise therapy versus treat-
ment as usual. All studies recruited participants according to the
Oxford criteria, thus no subgroup analyses were performed within
Analysis 1.12 and Analysis 1.13.

 1.8 Self-perceived changes in overall health
Seven trials assessed changes in overall health at end of treatment
or at follow-up by using a self-rated Global Impression Change
Scale with scores ranging from 1 (very much better) to 7 (very
much worse). We performed analysis of the numbers of partic-
ipants reporting improvement. Four trials (523 participants) re-
ported changes in overall health after end of treatment (Fulcher
1997; Moss-Morris 2005; Wallman 2004; Wearden 2010) and
consistently showed a larger number of participants with some
degree of improvement in the exercise group (RR 1.83, 95% CI
1.39 to 2.40; Analysis 1.14).
Three trials (518 participants) reporting self-perceived changes in
overall health at follow-up were more inconsistent (Jason 2007;
Powell 2001; White 2011). The point estimate for the risk ratio
favoured exercise therapy (RR 1.88, 95% CI 0.76 to 4.64; Analysis
1.15), but the confidence interval implies inconclusive results, and
heterogeneity was substantial (I² = 85%). Jason 2007 showed no
significant differences between exercise and relaxation (RR 0.83,
95% CI 0.44 to 1.56) and White 2011 suggested a positive effect
of exercise therapy compared with treatment as usual (RR 1.63,
95% CI 1.16 to 2.29), whereas Powell 2001 indicated a large
positive effect for exercise (RR 5.96, 95% CI 2.36 to 15.09).
Subgroup analysis
To explore the potential impact of varying exercise strategies and
control conditions, we performed a post hoc subgroup analysis
within Analysis 1.14 and Analysis 1.15.
Type of control
At end of treatment, the pooled RR for all available studies was
1.83 (95% CI 1.39 to 2.40; I² = 0%) compared with 1.99 (95%
CI 1.38 to 2.86; I² = 0%) in the treatment as usual subgroup
(Moss-Morris 2005; White 2011) and 1.64 (95% CI 1.09 to 2.48;
I² = 0%) in the relaxation/flexibility subgroup (Fulcher 1997;
Wallman 2004). Tests for subgroup differences did not establish
differences between the two groups (I² = 0%, P value 0.50).
Type of exercise
Three studies offering graded exercise therapy (Fulcher 1997;
Moss-Morris 2005; White 2011) tended towards a greater chance
of improvement (RR 2.01, 95% CI 1.46 to 2.77) than the study
offering exercise with personal pacing (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.85
to 2.41; Wallman 2004), but statistical tests did not establish a
subgroup difference (I² = 13.6%, P value 0.28).
At follow-up, the pooled RR for the three available studies was
1.88 (95% CI 0.76 to 4.64) in an analysis associated with extensive
heterogeneity (I² = 85%, P value 0.001). The post hoc subgroup
analysis did not firmly establish a subgroup difference (I² = 63%,
P value 0.10) between the two studies (Powell 2001; White 2011)
comparing graded exercise therapy versus treatment as usual (RR
2.92, 95% CI 0.75 to 11.35; I² = 87%) and Jason 2007, which
compared anaerobic activity versus relaxation (RR 0.83, 95% CI
0.44 to 1.56).
1.9 Health service resources
Data on health service resources are available for one of the in-
cluded studies with a total of 320 participants (White 2011). Dur-
ing the 12-month post-randomisation period, participants in the
treatment as usual group had a higher mean number of special-
ist medical care contacts than those allocated to exercise therapy
(MD -1.40, 95% CI -1.87 to -0.93; Analysis 1.16). Use of pri-
mary care resources (i.e. general practitioner or practice nurse),
other doctor contacts (i.e. neurologist, psychiatrist or other spe-
cialists), accident and emergency contacts, medication (i.e. hyp-
notics, anxiolytics, antidepressants or analgesics), contacts with
other healthcare professionals (i.e. dentist, optician, pharmacist,
psychologist, physiotherapist, community mental health nurse or
occupational therapist), inpatient contacts and other contacts with
healthcare/social services (e.g. social worker, support worker, nu-
tritionist, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomog-
raphy (CT), electroencephalography (EEG)) did not differ signif-
icantly between the two groups (Analysis 1.16; Analysis 1.17)
1.10 Drop-out
Six studies (Fulcher 1997; Moss-Morris 2005; Powell 2001;
Wearden 1998; Wearden 2010; White 2011), with a total of 843
participants, reported drop-out rates (Analysis 1.18). The pooled
RR for drop-out was 1.63 (95% CI 0.77 to 3.43). The confidence
interval implies that these results were inconclusive, and hetero-
geneity was moderate (I² = 50%).
Subgroup analysis
The main analysis pooled studies using treatment as usual (Moss-
Morris 2005; Powell 2001; Wearden 1998; Wearden 2010) and
studies using flexibility (Fulcher 1997) into the same comparison.
The pooled RR for all available studies was 1.63 (95% CI 0.77
to 3.43; I² = 50%) compared with 1.77 (95% CI 0.71 to 4.38;
I² = 61%) in the treatment as usual subgroup and 1.33 (95% CI
0.32 to 5.50) in the flexibility subgroup (Fulcher 1997). Tests for
subgroup differences did not establish differences between the two
groups (I² = 0%, P value 0.74).
Exercise therapy versus other treatments
Comparison 2. Exercise therapy versus psychological
treatment
Three trials (Jason 2007; White 2011; Wearden 2010) contributed
data to this comparison, which included cognitive-behavioural
21

 therapy (CBT) (Jason 2007; White 2011), cognitive therapy treat-
ment (COG) (Jason 2007) and supportive listening (Wearden
2010). We decided not to pool the results in meta-analyses because
of clinical and contextual heterogeneity.
2.1 Fatigue
End of treatment
White 2011 (298 participants) showed little or no difference in
fatigue between exercise therapy and CBT (MD 0.20, 95% CI -
1.49 to 1.89; Analysis 2.1).
Compared with 97 participants randomly assigned to supportive
listening (Wearden 2010), 85 participants in the graded exercise
therapy group experienced greater improvement in fatigue (MD -
4.03, 95% CI -6.24 to -1.82; P value < 0.001; Analysis 2.1).
Follow-up
Jason 2007 assessed fatigue using a 7-point Fatigue Severity Scale
(Krupp 1989) and showed an MD of -0.10 (95% CI -0.79 to 0.59)
for anaerobic exercise versus COG (49 participants; Analysis 2.2).
The wide confidence interval implies imprecise and inconclusive
results.
Wide confidence intervals and imprecise results also apply to the
comparison of anaerobic exercise versus CBT as reported by Jason
2007 (49 participants) with an MD of 0.40 (95% CI -0.34 to
1.14; Analysis 2.2). White 2011 compared graded exercise therapy
versus CBT (302 participants) by assessing fatigue on a 33-point
Fatigue Scale (Chalder 1993) and observed little or no difference
betweenthe twogroups(MD0.30, 95% CI -1.45to 2.05;Analysis
2.3).
Wearden 2010 (182 participants) assessed fatigue on a 33-point
Fatigue Scale (Chalder 1993) and reported differences between re-
habilitation and supportive listening that favoured graded exercise
therapy (MD -2.72, 95% CI -5.14 to -0.30; P value 0.03; Analysis
2.3).
Sensitivity analysis
At follow-up, the available studies (Jason 2007; White 2011) mea-
sured and reported fatigue on different scales, and we performed a
sensitivity analysis in which the two studies were pooled using an
SMD method. The resulting pooled SMD estimate is 0.07 (95%
CI -0.13 to 0.28) with no unexplained heterogeneity (I² = 0%, P
value 0.40).
Subgroup analysis
Post hoc subgroup analysis did not establish a subgroup difference
(I² = 0%, P value 0.40) between White 2011, which compared
graded exercise therapy versus CBT (SMD 0.04, 95% CI -0.19 to
0.26), and Jason 2007, which compared anaerobic activity versus
CBT (SMD 0.30, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.86).
2.2 Adverse effects
White 2011 reported the number of serious adverse reactions
(SARs) (European Union Clinical Trials Directive 2001) observed
in each treatment group (Analysis 2.4). Two adverse reactions pos-
sibly related to treatment were observed among the 160 partici-
pants in the exercise group (one participant with deterioration in
mobility and self-care, and one with worse CFS symptoms and
function), and three participants reporting a total of four SARs
were described among 161 participants in the CBT group (one
incident of self-harm, one incident of low mood with an episode
of self-harm, one episode of worsened mood and CFS symptoms
and one incident of threatened self-harm). Thus, the observed RR
was 0.67 (95% CI 0.11 to 3.96), implying that these results were
inconclusive.
Wearden 2010 stated that no participants in the rehabilitation or
supportive listening group demonstrated SARs with a probable
relation to therapy (Analysis 2.4).
2.3 Pain
Jason 2007 (43 participants) reported differences in pain at follow-
up (52 weeks), as assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory (Cleeland
1994). When anaerobic exercise was compared with CBT, results
were imprecise for pain severity (MD 0.07, 95% CI -1.52 to 1.66;
Analysis 2.5) and for pain interference (MD -0.35, 95% CI -2.29
to 1.59; Analysis 2.6). As the result of baseline differences between
groups, these estimates, to some extent, are biased in favour of
exercise.
Jason 2007 also compared anaerobic exercise versus COG (44 par-
ticipants). Here, inconclusive results were observed in pain sever-
ity (MD 0.51, 95% CI -0.92 to 1.94; Analysis 2.5) and pain in-
terference (MD 0.39, 95% CI -1.37 to 2.15; Analysis 2.6).
2.4 Physical functioning
End of treatment
White 2011 (298 participants) reported changes in physical func-
tioning between participants randomly assigned to exercise and
CBT at end of treatment by using the SF-36 physical functioning
subscale (Ware 1992). Scores on this scale range from 0 to 100,
and study authors observed little or no difference in physical func-
tion between the two groups (MD -1.20, 95% CI -6.30 to 3.90;
Analysis 2.7).
Wearden 2010 (181 participants) suggested greater improvement
in physical function among participants in the graded exercise
22

 therapy group than in the supportive listening group (MD -6.66
point, 95% CI -13.7 to 0.40; P value 0.06; Analysis 2.7), but little
or no difference cannot be ruled out.
Follow-up
Both Jason 2007 andWhite 2011 reportedphysical functionat52-
week follow-up. Whereas White 2011 (302 participants) observed
little or no difference between graded exercise therapy and CBT
(MD 0.50, 95% CI -4.89 to 5.89; Analysis 2.8), Jason 2007 (46
participants) reported a significant difference favouring CBT (MD
18.92, 95% CI 2.12 to 35.72; Analysis 2.8) when compared with
anaerobic exercise. However, results of the latter study are skewed
because of uncorrected baseline differences in physical function
between the two groups (39 vs 46 points), and this explains some
of the observed heterogeneity.
Jason 2007 (47 participants) also compared anaerobic exercise ver-
sus COG, suggesting a large difference in favour of COG (MD
21.37, 95% CI 6.61 to 36.13; Analysis 2.8). It should be noted,
however, that the latter estimate is probably biased in favour of
COG because of uncorrected baseline differences in physical func-
tion between the two groups (39 vs 46 points).
Wearden 2010 (171 participants) suggested greater improvement
in physical function among participants in the graded exercise
therapy than in the supportive listening group (MD -7.55 point,
95% CI -15.57 to 0.47; Analysis 2.8), but little or no difference
cannot be ruled out.
2.5 Quality of life
Study authors provided no data.
2.6.1 Depression
End of treatment
In Wearden 2010 (182 participants), graded exercise therapy was
associated with greater improvement on the HADS depression
subscale (Zigmond 1983) than was seen with supportive listening
(MD -1.57, 95% CI -2.74 to -0.40; P value 0.008; Analysis 2.9).
We did not identify trials reporting depression for exercise versus
CBT or for exercise versus COG at end of treatment.
Follow-up
Jason 2007 assessed depression using the Beck Depression Inven-
tory (BDI-II) (Beck 1996). When comparing anaerobic exercise
versus COG (45 participants), study authors saw a trend towards
greater improvement among participants in the COG group (MD
5.08, 95% CI -0.77 to 10.93; Analysis 2.10), but little or no dif-
ference cannot be ruled out.
Two trials compared exercise therapy versus CBT (Jason 2007;
White 2011), with neither showing statistically significant differ-
ences between the two groups. Jason 2007 (44 participants) as-
sessed depression using the BDI-II (Beck 1996) and reported im-
precise results (MD 2.99, 95% CI -4.37 to 10.35; Analysis 2.10);
interpretation of these results is further complicated by baseline
differences between groups. On the other hand, White 2011 (287
participants) assessed depression using the HADS depression sub-
scale (Zigmond 1983) and found little or no difference between
graded exercise therapy and CBT (MD -0.10, 95% CI -1.00 to
0.80; Analysis 2.11).
Wearden 2010 compared graded exercise therapy and supportive
listening. At end of treatment, results favoured exercise, but this
effect was not sustained at 70 weeks’ follow-up (171 participants;
MD -0.79, 95%CI -2.31 to 0.55; Analysis 2.11).
Sensitivity analysis
As depression was measured and reported on two different scales
in Jason 2007 and White 2011, we performed a sensitivity analysis
in which the two studies were pooled using an SMD method. The
resulting pooled SMD estimate is 0.01 (95% CI -0.21 to 0.22)
with no unexplained heterogeneity (I² = 0%, P value 0.42).
Subgroup analysis
Post hoc subgroup analysis did not establish a subgroup difference
(I² = 0%, P value 0.42) between White 2011, which compared
graded exercise therapy versus CBT (SMD -0.03, 95% CI -0.26 to
0.21) and Jason 2007, which compared anaerobic exercise versus
CBT (SMD 0.23, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.83).
2.6.2 Anxiety
End of treatment
Wearden 2010 (182 participants) found little or no difference
on the HADS anxiety subscale (Zigmond 1983) between graded
exercise therapy and supportive listening (MD -0.48, 95% CI -
1.85 to 0.89; Analysis 2.12). We did not identify trials reporting
anxiety for exercise therapy versus CBT or for exercise therapy
versus COG at end of treatment.
Follow-up
Jason 2007 (45 participants) assessed anxiety using the Beck Anx-
iety Inventory (BAI) (Beck 1996). When comparing anaerobic
exercise versus COG, study authors did not observe statistically
significant differences between groups, but results were imprecise
(MD 3.15, 95% CI -1.17 to 7.47; Analysis 2.13).
Two trials compared exercise therapy versus CBT (Jason 2007;
White 2011), with neither showing statistically significant differ-
ences between the two groups. Jason 2007 (44 participants) as-
sessed anxiety using the BAI (Beck 1996), with imprecise and sta-
tistically insignificant results (MD 0.66, 95% CI -4.68 to 6.00;
23

 Analysis 2.13). White 2011 (287 participants) found little or no
difference between graded exercise therapy and CBT using the
HADS anxiety subscale (MD 0.30, 95% CI -0.71 to 1.31; Analysis
2.14).
Wearden 2010 (171 participants) did not observe statistically sig-
nificant differences on the HADS anxiety subscale between graded
exercise therapy and supportive listening at 70 weeks (MD -0.08,
95%CI -1.52 to 1.36; Analysis 2.14).
Sensitivity analysis
As depression was measured and reported on two different scales
in Jason 2007 and White 2011, we performed a sensitivity analysis
in which the two studies were pooled using an SMD method. The
resulting pooled SMD estimate is 0.07 (95% CI -0.15 to 0.28)
with no unexplained heterogeneity (I² = 0%, P value 0.99).
Subgroup analysis
Post hoc subgroup analysis did not establish a subgroup difference
(I² = 0%, P value 0.99) between White 2011, which compared
graded exercise therapy versus CBT (SMD 0.07, 95% CI -0.16 to
0.30) and Jason 2007, which compared anaerobic activity versus
CBT (SMD 0.07, 95% CI -0.52 to 0.66).
2.7 Sleep
End of treatment
Wearden 2010 observed that the 83 participants in the graded
exercise therapy group experienced greater improvement on the
20-point Jenkins Sleep Scale (Jenkins 1988) as compared with
the 97 participants in the supportive listening group (MD -2.46
points, 95% CI -4.01 to -0.91; P value 0.002; Analysis 2.15). We
did not identify trials reporting sleep for exercise therapy versus
CBT or for exercise therapy versus COG at end of treatment.
Follow-up
White 2011 (287 participants) assessed sleep using the Jenkins
Sleep Scale (Jenkins 1988) and found little or no difference be-
tween graded exercise therapy and CBT (MD -0.90, 95%CI -2.07
to 0.27; Analysis 2.16). Wearden 2010 (171 participant) also used
the Jenkins Sleep Scale and found little or no difference between
graded exercise therapy and supportive listening (MD -0.86, 95%
CI -2.56 to 0.84; Analysis 2.16).
2.8 Self-perceived changes in overall health
Two trials (Jason 2007; White 2011) assessed changes in overall
health by using a self-rated Global Impression Change Scale with
scores ranging from 1 (very much better) to 7 (very much worse)
(Guy 1976). We performed analysis of the numbers of participants
reporting improvement.
End of treatment
White 2011 (320 participants) reported changes in overall health
following graded exercise therapy versus CBT, but results were
inconclusive (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.31; Analysis 2.17).
Follow-up
Atfollow-up, self-perceivedchangesinoverall health were reported
by Jason 2007 and White 2011.
For the comparison of COG versus anaerobic exercise, Jason 2007
(50 participants) showed that more participants in the CBT group
than in the exercise group tended to report improvement, but
little or no difference between CBT and exercise therapy cannot
be ruled out (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.10; Analysis 2.18).
Both Jason 2007 (47 participants) and White 2011 (321 partici-
pants) compared exercise therapy versus CBT. Pooling resulted in
an RR of 0.71 (95% CI 0.33 to 1.54; Analysis 2.18), implying
imprecise and inconclusive results. The meta-analysis was associ-
ated with considerable heterogeneity (I2 = 86%) as the result of
inconsistency between effect estimates reported by Jason 2007,
which compared anaerobic exercise versus CBT (RR 0.46, 95%
CI 0.28 to 0.77), and White 2011, which compared graded exer-
cise therapy versus CBT (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.35).
2.9 Health service resources
Data on health service resources were provided by one of the in-
cluded studies with a total of 321 participants (White 2011). Dur-
ing the 12-month post-randomisation period, participants in the
CBT group showed lower mean numbers of contacts with neurol-
ogist, psychiatrist or other specialists (MD 0.60, 95% CI 0.05 to
1.15; Analysis 2.19) and lower mean numbers of inpatient days
(MD 0.80, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.19; Analysis 2.19) when compared
with participants in the exercise group. However, these group dif-
ferences were not seen when data were analysed at a dichotomous
level (Analysis 2.20).
2.10 Drop-out
White 2011 (321 participant) reported drop-out from treatment.
Drop-out rates were not significantly different between graded
exercise therapyandCBT(RR0.59, 95%CI0.28 to1.25;Analysis
2.21), but these results were imprecise and inconclusive because
few events were reported.
Wearden 2010 reported that more participants discontinued
graded exercise therapy (12 of 92 participants) than supportive
listening (7 of 91 participants) (RR 1.70, 95% CI 0.70 to 4.11;
Analysis 2.21), but the confidence interval implies that these re-
sults were imprecise and inconclusive.

 Comparison 3. Exercise therapy versus adaptive pacing
therapy
One trial contributed data on 319 participants for this comparison
(White 2011).
3.1 Fatigue
Fatigue assessed by a 33-point Fatigue Scale (Chalder 1993) im-
proved more among participants allocated to graded exercise ther-
apy than adaptive pacing (MD -2.00, 95% CI -3.57 to -0.43; P
value 0.01) when measured at end of treatment (24 weeks; 305
participants). This positive effect was sustained at 52 weeks’ fol-
low-up (307 participants; MD -2.50, 95% CI -4.16 to -0.84; P
value 0.003; Analysis 3.1).
3.2 Adverse effects
White 2011 reported the number of SARs (European Union
Clinical Trials Directive 2001) observed in each treatment group
(Analysis 3.2). Two SARs possibly related to treatment were ob-
served among the 160 participants in the graded exercise therapy
group (one incident of deterioration in mobility and self-care, and
one episode of worse CFS symptoms and function) compared with
two in the adaptive pacing group (159 participants) (one incident
of suicidal thoughts, and one episode of worsened depression).
Thus, results were inconclusive, with an RR of 0.99 (95% CI 0.14
to 6.97).
3.3 Pain
No data were provided.
3.4 Physical functioning
The graded exercise therapy group (150 participants) experienced
significant improvement in physical functioning compared with
the adaptive pacing group (155 participants) (Analysis 3.3). At
end of treatment, participants in the graded exercise therapy group
scored a mean of 12.2 points better (95% CI -17.23 to -7.17) on
the SF-36 physical functioning subscale (Ware 1992) than those
in the adaptive pacing group-a difference that was sustained at 52
weeks’ follow-up (307 participants; MD -11.8, 95% CI -17.5 to
-6.05).
3.5 Quality of life
No data were provided.
3.6.1 Depression
The change on the HADS depression subscale (Zigmond 1983)
at end of treatment was not reported (White 2011). At follow-
up, participants in the graded exercise therapy group (144 partici-
pants) had improved by a mean of 1.10 points (95% CI -2.09 to -
0.11) on the HADS depression subscale when compared with the
149 participants in the pacing group (Analysis 3.4).
3.6.2 Anxiety
White 2011 did not report the change on the HADS anxiety
subscale (Zigmond 1983) at end of treatment, and they observed
little or no difference between the two groups (293 participants)
at 52 weeks (MD -0.40, 95% CI -1.40 to 0.60; Analysis 3.5).
3.7 Sleep
White 2011 did not report change in sleep at end of treatment
as assessed by the 20-point Jenkins Sleep Scale (Jenkins 1988). At
follow-up, participants in the graded exercise therapy group (144
participants) had improved by a mean of 1.60 points (95% CI -
2.70 to -0.50) when compared with the 150 participants in the
adaptive pacing group (Analysis 3.6).
3.8 Self-perceived changes in overall health
White 2011 assessed changes in overall health by using a self-rated
Global Impression Change Scale with scores ranging from 1 (very
much better) to 7 (very much worse) (Guy 1976). Comparisons of
the numbers of participants reporting improvement showed that a
larger fraction of participants in the graded exercise therapy group
experienced improvement at end of treatment (319 participants;
RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.07; Analysis 3.7). At follow-up, an
estimate of effect that suggested improvement favouring graded
exercise therapy was still observed, but little or no effect cannot be
ruled out (319 participants; RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.79).
3.9 Health service resources
One of the included studies with a total of 319 participants pro-
vided data on health service resources (White 2011). During the
12-month post-randomisation period, participants in the pacing
group showed lower mean numbers of contacts with complemen-
tary healthcare resources (MD 3.80, 95% CI 1.42 to 6.18; Analysis
3.8), lower mean numbers of contacts with other doctors (neurol-
ogist, psychiatrist and other specialists) (MD 0.70, 95% CI 0.14
to 1.26; Analysis 3.8), lower mean numbers of accidents and emer-
gencies (MD 0.50, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.69; Analysis 3.8) and higher
mean numbers of inpatient days (MD 1.00, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.54;
Analysis 3.8) than were seen among participants in the exercise
group. However, these group differences were not seen when data
were analysed at a dichotomous level (Analysis 3.9).

 3.10 Drop-out
In the PACE trial (White 2011), 10 of the 160 participants in the
graded exercise therapy group and 11 of the 160 participants in the
adaptive pacing group withdrew, thus the results were inconclusive
(RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.08; Analysis 3.10).
Comparison 4. Exercise therapy versus antidepressants
One trial contributed data on a total of 69 participants to this
comparison (Wearden 1998). In this trial, investigators combined
graded exercise therapy with antidepressant placebo, and the an-
tidepressant used was fluoxetine.
4.1 Fatigue
Investigators assessed fatigue on a 42-point Fatigue Scale (Chalder
1993; 48 participants) at end of treatment, but the results were
inconclusive (MD -1.99, 95% CI -8.28 to 4.30; Analysis 4.1).

4.6.1 Depression
Researchers assessed depression among 48 participants at end of
treatment using the HADS depression subscale (Zigmond 1983),
but they found little or no difference between the exercise and
fluoxetine groups (MD 0.15, 95% CI -2.11 to 2.41; Analysis 4.2).

Wearden 1998 observed similar drop-out rates in both groups,
with 11 drop-outs reported among the 34 participants in the ex-
ercise group and 10 drop-outs among the 35 participants in the
antidepressant group (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.31; Analysis
4.3), implying that the results were inconclusive.
Exercise therapy adjunctive to other treatment
versus the other treatment alone
Comparison 5. Exercise therapy versus antidepressants plus
exercise therapy
One trial contributed data for a total of 68 participants to this
comparison (Wearden 1998). In this trial, investigators combined
graded exercise therapy with use of the antidepressant fluoxetine.
5.1 Fatigue
Researchers assessed fatigue on a 42-point Fatigue Scale (Chalder
1993; 43 participants) at end of treatment, but the results were
inconclusive (MD -3.66, 95% CI -10.41 to 3.09; Analysis 5.1).

ercise plus antidepressant group, and 10 drop-outs among the 35
participants in the antidepressant group (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.77
to 2.87; Analysis 5.3). The confidence interval implies that the
results were inconclusive.

Summary of main results
We have included eight studies including 1518 participants in this
review.
When exercise therapy was compared with ’passive control,’ fa-
tigue was significantly reduced at end of treatment (Analysis 1.1).
Data on serious adverse reactions (SARs) were available from only
one trial, and SARs were rare, but too few events were reported
to allow any conclusions to be drawn (Analysis 1.3). A positive
effect of exercise therapy was observed both at end of treatment
and at follow-up with respect to sleep (Analysis 1.12; Analysis
1.13), physical functioning (Analysis 1.5; Analysis 1.6) and self-
perceived changes in overall health (Analysis 1.14; Analysis 1.15).
For the remaining outcomes, we were not able to draw any con-
clusions.
When exercise therapy was compared with cognitive-behavioural
therapy (CBT), little or no difference in fatigue was noted be-
tween the two groups (Analysis 2.1; Analysis 2.2). Serious adverse
reactions were rare and were reported at similar rates in the two
groups. Events were few; therefore results were too imprecise to al-
low any conclusions to be drawn (Analysis 2.4). Little or no differ-
ence was observed between exercise therapy and CBT for physical
functioning(Analysis 2.7; Analysis 2.8), depression(Analysis 2.10;
Analysis 2.11), anxiety (Analysis 2.13; Analysis 2.14) and sleep
(Analysis 2.16). It was not possible to draw any conclusions re-
garding pain (Analysis 2.5; Analysis 2.6), self-perceived changes in
overall health (Analysis 2.17; Analysis 2.18) or drop-out (Analysis
2.21).
When exercise therapy was compared with pacing, fatigue (
Analysis 3.1), physical functioning (Analysis 3.3), depression
(Analysis 3.4), sleep (Analysis 3.6) and self-perceived changes in
overall health at end of treatment (Analysis 3.7) were significantly
better. Data on SARs were available from only one trial, and SARs
were rare, but events were too few to allow any conclusions to be
drawn (Analysis 3.2). For anxiety, little or no difference between
groups was reported (Analysis 3.5).
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
The evidence base was limited to patients able to participate in ex-
ercise therapy, and all studies were conducted in developed coun-
tries (Australia, New Zealand, North America and the United
Kingdom). Settings varied from primary to tertiary care, which
suggests easy generalisation. Most of the outcomes investigated
were reported in the included studies, apart from health service re-
sources. Most studies used aerobic exercise, but it would be prefer-
able if we had found studies that used different types of exercise
therapy, as this would reflect clinical practice.
Quality of the evidence
Risk of bias across studies was relatively low. We were able to iden-
tify pre-published protocols for only two studies (Wearden 2010;
White 2011) and have identified a risk of unpublished outcomes.
One limitation is that formal blinding of participants and clini-
cians to treatment arm is not inherently possible in trials of ex-
ercise therapy. This increases risk of bias, as instructors’ and par-
ticipants’ knowledge of group assignation might have influenced
the true effect. In addition, outcomes were measured subjectively
(e.g. questionnaires, visual analogue scales), leading to risk that
this might increase the outcome estimate. Against this, many pa-
tient charities are opposed to exercise therapy for chronic fatigue
syndrome (CFS), and this may in contrast reduce the effect. Six
of the seven studies reported that investigators used intention-to-
treat analysis, but this was done in different ways, which might
27

 have influenced the effect estimate. One study (Jason 2007) re-
ported baseline differences, used a best linear unbiased predictor
to avoid taking missing data into account and described 25 out-
comes, with none stated as primary.
Several methodological challenges have become evident during
the review process. An obvious topic of discussion is the between-
study variation observed with regard to type of exercise, inten-
sity of exercise and incremental procedures used (Table 2). We ac-
knowledge that an effect of exercise therapy is likely to depend on
how training is conducted, thus inclusion of trials using different
exercise regimens is likely to introduce some heterogeneity into
the analysis. Possibly equally important, the treatment provided to
participants in the control group was not uniform across included
trials. Whereas the difference between waiting list, relaxation and
treatment as usual is rather obvious, it is important to recognise
that the actual ingredients of ‘treatment as usual’ differ widely
among the included trials, and this may contribute to variation
in observed effect estimates. With regard to participants and their
health status, it is important to realise that substantial differences
in baseline illness severity were noted, as illustrated by the wide
range in baseline physical functioning, depression co-morbidity
and illness duration shown in Table 1. Some trials applied nar-
row selection criteria, whereas others seem to have included more
heterogeneous sample populations; these differences might cause
variation in the observed effect estimate. Our finding of similar
outcomes with different definitions of CFS mitigates this risk.
All potential sources of heterogeneity mentioned above could have
contributed to variation in results derived from the aggregate
analysis presented in the present review and might have reduced
our ability to draw firm conclusions. It is easy to imagine a po-
tential correlation between observed treatment effect and factors
such as exercise characteristics, control conditions, participant re-
cruitment strategies, participant characteristics and baseline dif-
ferences. We aimed to explore these associations in subgroup anal-
yses. However, the number of potential heterogeneity factors is
high and the number of available trials is low; therefore we were
limited in our ability to explore heterogeneity in a sensible way at
the aggregate level.
Potential biases in the review process
The strength of this review lies in its rigorous methods, which
include thorough searching for evidence, systematic appraisal of
study quality and systematic and well-defined data synthesis. Even
though we tried to search as extensively as possible, we may have
missed out on eligible trials, such as trials reported only in disser-
tations or in non-indexed journals.
The table of interventions (Table 2) includes published and un-
published information regarding types of interventions, but not
effect estimates. For this updated review, we have not collected
unpublished data for our outcomes but have used data from the
2004 review (Edmonds 2004) and from published versions of in-
cluded articles.
The authors of this review had to make a cutoff regarding what
kind of exercise should be included. We decided to exclude tradi-
tional Chinese exercise such as Tai Chi and Qigong, but to include
pragmatic rehabilitation for which the type of exercise is described
as walking, walking stairs, bicycling, dancing or jogging. The cut-
off might be contentious, and discussion regarding what type of
exercise should be included should be ongoing.
One of the included studies (Powell 2001) is an outlier, reporting
very positive results in favour of exercise therapy; we decided post
hoc to perform a sensitivity analysis from which Powell 2001 was
excluded to learn what the results would be if this study was not
included.
Review authors noted potential bias regarding how the compara-
tors in this review were categorised and pooled. We decided to
report diverse comparators such as cognitive-behavioural ther-
apy (CBT), cognitive therapy treatment (COG) and support-
ive therapy together as a single comparator called ’psychologi-
cal treatments’ (however, because of clinical and contextual het-
erogeneity, we decided not to pool the results in meta-analyses).
These different psychological treatments do have similar elements,
for example, both CBT and COG use cognitive approaches and
goal setting; however they differ in certain respects (e.g. CBT
tries to change unhelpful thoughts, while COG aims to accept
them (Jason 2007)). Our approach of combining these compara-
tors might be considered contentious, and discussion about what
should be lumped together and what should be split into different
comparators should be ongoing.
Meta-analysis of individual patient data (IPD) constitutes an alter-
native approach to meta-analysis of aggregate data. Analysis based
on individual patient data in general will enable us to use a wider
range of statistical and analytical approaches (Higgins 2011). In
particular, by utilising IPD, it is possible to explore the relative
importance of the various heterogeneity factors mentioned above
more thoroughly, and to ensure that missing data and baseline dif-
ferences are dealt with in standardised ways. With access to IPD,
it is also possible to perform subgroup analyses that have not been
previously reported. A project aimed at undertaking IPD analyses
of the trials included in the present review has been initiated, and
when the IPD analyses are presented, they are likely to shed some
new light on the aggregate level analyses presented in the current
systematic review.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
This review is an updated version of a review that was originally
published in 2004 (Edmonds 2004); the revised version offers ma-
jor additions and changes. According to recent updates provided
in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions,
we have implemented several methodological improvements, in-
28
Exercise therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome (Review)
Copyright © 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 cluding a thorough risk of bias assessment for all included studies
(Higgins 2011). Also, the updated search for literature led to the
inclusion of three new trials with a total of 1051 participants (Jason
2007; Wearden 2010; White 2011), thus the number of included
participants has more than tripled since the 2004 version. The
inclusion of new trials has important implications. First, statistical
power has been increased by the addition of new data. Second, the
most recent trials offered longer follow-up times; therefore we can
provide more clear conclusions about follow-up treatment effects
in this update than were provided in the original review. Third,
the most recent trials involve comparisons beyond exercise therapy
versus treatment as usual, for example, comparisons of exercise
therapy versus other active treatment strategies such as CBT and
adaptive pacing therapy.
This update provides valuable additional information when com-
pared with the original review, and results reported in the orig-
inal review are largely confirmed in this update. Moreover, the
results reported here correspond well with those of other system-
atic reviews (Bagnall 2002; Larun 2011; Prins 2006) and with
existing guidelines (NICE 2007). One meta-analysis of CBT and
GET suggests that the two treatments are equally efficacious, espe-
cially for patients with co-morbid anxiety or depressive symptoms
(Castell 2011).
A recent randomised trial comparing quality of life among par-
ticipants randomly assigned to group CBT plus graded exercise
therapy plus conventional pharmacological treatment or exercise
counselling plus conventional pharmacological treatment found
no differences between the two groups at 12 months’ follow-up
(Nunez 2011). This trial did not meet our a priori inclusion crite-
ria and was excluded from our review. As the comparison used in
Nunez 2011 differs from the comparisons reported in our review,
it is difficult to compare the results directly; this comparison was
complicated further by the fact that Nunez 2011 did not mea-
sure outcomes viewed as primary outcomes in our review. Conse-
quently, our view is that the conclusions presented in our review
correspond well with those of other relevant studies and reviews,
but further research is needed to explore the considerable hetero-
geneity observed across available trials.

Implications for practice
Encouragingevidence suggeststhatexercise therapycancontribute
to alleviation of some symptoms of CFS, especially fatigue. Exer-
cise therapy seems to perform better than no intervention or pac-
ing and seems to lead to results similar to those seen with cognitive
behavioural therapy. Reported results were obtained from patients
who were able to participate (not from those too disabled to at-
tend clinics); these results were inconclusive as to type of exercise
therapy and showed heterogeneity. Few serious adverse reactions
were reported. We think the evidence suggests that exercise ther-
apy might be an effective and safe intervention for patients able
to attend clinics as outpatients.
Implications for research
Further randomised controlled studies are needed to clarify the
most effective type, intensity and duration of exercise therapy.
These studies should report contextual characteristics of the exer-
cise therapy provided, such as deliverer of the intervention, sched-
ule, explanation and materials, supervision and monitoring. It is
important that these trials measure health service use alongside the
primary outcomes of fatigue and adverse effects, as well as along-
side relevant secondary outcomes. Researchers should take care to
describe which set of diagnostic criteria they have used and how
they operationalised the diagnostic process.

Setting: secondary/tertiary care
Country: UK
Interventions
Group 1: treatment as usual (n = 34)
Group 2: exercise therapy + 2 sessions (total 3 hours, n = 37)
Group 3: exercise therapy + 7 telephone sessions (total 3.5 hours, n = 39)
Group 4: exercise therapy + 7 sessions (total 7 hours, n = 38)

• Fatigue (Fatigue Scale, FS; 11 items; scores > 3 indicate excessive fatigue)
• Anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS; score
range from 0 to 21 worst)
• Sleep (Jenkins Sleep Scale, 4 items; lower scores indicate better outcomes; score
range 0 to 20 worst)
• Changes in overall health (Global Impression Scale; score between 1 and 7, where
1 = very much better, 4 = no change)
• Illness beliefs and experience of treatment (simple questionnaire)
Outcomes assessed at 3 (end treatment), 6 and 12 months
Notes
Treatment as usual comprised a medical assessment, advice and an information booklet
that encouraged graded activity and positive thinking but gave no explanations for
symptoms
SF-36 physical functioning subscale is reported on a 10 to 30 scale. We transformed
scores from the 10 to 30 scale to the more common 0 to 100 scale by using the following
formula: meannew = (meanold - 10) * 5 and SDnew = 5 * SDold

scale, 27.4
Setting: secondary/tertiary care
Country: UK
Interventions
Group 1, specialist medical care (SMC): provided by doctors with specialist experience
in CFS. All participants were given a leaflet explaining the illness and the nature of
this treatment. Treatment consisted of an explanation of chronic fatigue syndrome,
generic advice such as to avoid extremes of activity and rest, specific advice on self-help
according to the particular approach chosen by the participant (if receiving SMC alone)
and symptomatic pharmacotherapy (especially for insomnia, pain and mood, n = 160)
Group 2, adaptive pacing therapy (APT): based on the envelope theory aimed at opti-
mum adaptation to the illness by helping the participant to plan and pace activity to
reduce or avoid fatigue, achieve prioritised activities and provide the best conditions for
natural recovery. Therapeutic strategies consisted of identifying links between activity
and fatigue by using a daily diary, with corresponding encouragement to plan activity
to avoid exacerbations, developing awareness of early warnings of exacerbation, limiting
demands and stress, regularly planning rest and relaxation and alternating different types
of activities, with advice not to undertake activities that demanded more than 70% of
participants’ perceived energy envelopes. Increased activities were encouraged if partici-
pants felt able, and as long as they did not exacerbate symptoms (n = 160)
Group 3, cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT): done on the basis of the fear avoidance
theory of CFS. The aim of treatment was to change the behavioural and cognitive factors
assumed to be responsible for perpetuation of participants’ symptoms and disability.
Therapeutic strategies guided participants to address unhelpful cognitions, including
fears about symptoms or activities, by testing them through behavioural experiments.
These experiments consisted of establishing a baseline of activity and rest and a regular
sleep pattern, then making collaboratively planned gradual increases in both physical
and mental activity. Participants were helped to address social and emotional obstacles
to improvement through problem solving (n = 161)
Group 4, graded exercise therapy (GET): done on the basis of deconditioning and exer-
cise intolerance theories of chronic fatigue syndrome. The aim of treatment was to help
participants gradually return to appropriate physical activities and reverse decondition-
ing, thereby reducing fatigue and disability. Therapeutic strategies consisted of establish-
ment of a baseline of achievable exercise or physical activity, followed by a negotiated,
incremental increase in the duration of time spent being physically active. Target heart
rate ranges were set when necessary to avoid overexertion, which eventually aimed at 30
minutes of light exercise 5 times a week. When this rate was achieved, the intensity and
aerobic nature of the exercise (usually walking) were gradually increased in response to
participant feedback and with mutual planning (n = 160)

Pilot study on the effects of intermittent and graded exercise compared with no exercise for optimising health
and reducing symptoms in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) patients
Methods
Randomised controlled trial, parallel
Participants
Inclusion criteria: medical diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome: persistent and disabling, and/or recurring,
fatigue lasting longer than 6 months, which does not result from physical exertion and is not alleviated by
rest. Other symptoms include muscle weakness and pain, ongoing medical symptoms such as swollen lymph
nodes and fever, poor sleep, poor concentration and reduced quality of life
Exclusion criteria: diagnosed cardiac and/or respiratory disease; joint or muscle condition/disease other than
CFS that is contraindicated for exercise; any mental health condition that may affect exercise participation or
safety of participants and researchers
Age minimum: 18 years
Age maximum: 60 years
Gender: both male and female
Interventions
Randomised controlled trial of intermittent exercise training compared with graded exercise and standard
care. Graded exercise is the current recommended exercise approach to CFS; it consists of self-paced (e.g.
low-intensity) steady state exercise at a constant workload for a short time; as the patient’s fitness gradually
improves, the length of time and eventually the intensity are increased in a gradual graded manner, provided
no adverse symptoms occur. Intermittent or interval exercise consists of short blocks of exercise at low to
moderate intensity with a rest interval in between bouts of exercise (e.g. 1 minute of low-intensity cycling,
followed by 1 minute of rest, followed by 1 minute of cycling); total time spent exercising can be gradually
increased whilst rest or unloaded exercise intervals are maintained. Participants will be randomly allocated to
1 of 3 groups. Each group will consist of 20 participants to provide a power of 80% for the study (based on
data from Gordon 2010), with an a prior test used to compute required sample size, given alpha (P value 0.
05), power and effect size for an F test, and looking at ANOVA fixed effects, main effects and interactions
(GPower). Volunteers will participate in 3 aerobic exercise sessions (cycling on a cycle ergometer) per week,
consisting of the following
• Warm-up of 5 minutes of unloaded cycling for both ITE and GE groups
• Either a steady state (constant effort) low- to moderate-intensity cycling period (50% VO2peak, RPE 3
Modified Borg Scale) initially for 10 minutes (GE group) OR an intermittent exercise block of 1 minute of
moderate-intensity cycling (60% VO2peak, RPE 4 to 5) alternated with 1 minute of unloaded or very low-
intensity/unloaded cycling (20% to 30% VO2peak, RPE 1 to 2), totaling 20 minutes
• Cool-down of 5 minutes unloaded cycling plus stretching of main muscle groups for both groups
Over the 12 weeks of the project, we aim to progress the duration of SS exercise towards 20 minutes, as
tolerated by the participant, and to progress ITE participants towards intervals of 2 to 3 minutes of moderate-
intensity cycling, alternated with 1-minute intervals of low-intensity cycling, totaling 25 to 30 minutes in
duration. All group sessions will be supervised by a member of the research team (consisting of accredited
exercise physiologists) with assistance from postgraduate Masters of Clinical Exercise Physiology students,
who are studying to become accredited exercise physiologists

Total intervention duration will be 12 weeks for graded, intermittent and control groups
Outcomes
Improved physiological adaptations to exercise (reduced RPE, heart rate and blood pressure). Rate of perceived
exertion (RPE) is assessed using a standard 10-point Borg Scale on which participants are asked how hard
they feel they are exercising; heart rate will be measured using a 12-lead ECG during prestudy and poststudy
exercise tests, and during exercise sessions, by using a Polar heart rate monitor; blood pressure will be monitored
constantly during prestudy and poststudy exercise testing, and during exercise sessions, using a standard
sphygmomanometer and an adult-sized cuff and stethoscope
Increased lymphocyte function and reduced inflammatory cytokines measured prestudy and poststudy by
comparison of immune cell counts, lymphocyte (CD4, CD8, CD19, NK) function and inflammatory cy-
tokines (IFN-λ, IL-1) in both exercise groups and control groups. Cell counts will be measured by full blood
count (standard pathology); lymphocyte subsets will be measured by cell count using a FACSCanto flow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson); lymphocyte function will be analysed using proliferative assays with flow
cytometric fluorescent analysis; and inflammatory cytokines will be assessed using standard ELISA assays
Increased VO2peak, as measured prestudy and poststudy by open circuit spirometry (Sensormedics) metabolic
cart and by breath-by-breath analysis. The test protocol is a cycle test starting with a 3-minute warm-up of
unloaded cycling, followed by 1-minute increments of 10 watts (W) until a VO2 plateau is achieved (i.e. VO2
does not increase, although workload continues to increase and/or RER > 1.15 and/or peak heart rate within
10 beats per minute of age-predicted maximum and/or volitional exhaustion). The test may also be stopped
at the request of participants if they feel too fatigued. If a submaximal value is achieved at this stage, a peak
VO2 value can be extrapolated by using a linear regression

Protocol for the “four steps to control your fatigue (4-STEPS)” randomised controlled trial: a self-regulation
based physical activity intervention for patients with unexplained chronic fatigue
Methods
Multi-centre, randomised controlled trial (RCT)
Participants
Fulfilling operationalised criteria for idiopathic chronic fatigue (ICF) and for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)
Patients visiting their physician with a main complaint of unexplained fatigue of at least 6 months’ duration
are recruited for the study
Inclusion criteria: meeting the operationalised criteria for ICF or CFS (CDC criteria); between 18 and 65
years of age; fluent in spoken Portuguese; capacity to provide informed consent Exclusion criteria: presence
of a concurrent somatic condition that can explain the fatigue symptoms; severe psychiatric disorders
Interventions
Standard care (SC) or standard care plus a self-regulation based physical activity programme (4-STEPS)
In addition to standard care, participants in the intervention group received the 4-STEPS programme con-
sisting of the following
• 2 face-to-face individual motivational interviewing (MI) sessions aimed at exploring important health
and life goals, increasing participants’ motivation and confidence to be physically active and setting a
specific personal physical activity goal. The first MI session takes place 1 week after the baseline assessment,
and the second MI session takes place 2 weeks after the first. The MI session is delivered by a psychologist
with MI training (member of the research team). The duration of the sessions is approximately 1 hour.
Details on topics addressed during the MI sessions are presented in Table 1
• 2 brief telephone counselling sessions: Sessions take about 20 minutes and are provided 2 weeks and 6
weeks after the last MI session. Details on topics addressed during the telephone sessions are presented in
Table 1
• Self-regulation (SR) booklets: 2 booklets were designed to help patients change their level of physical
activity (informational booklet and workbook). The informational booklet was provided at the end of the
baseline assessment; the “Step 1” part of the workbook is provided at the first MI session, and parts “Step 2,
” “Step 3” and “Step 4” are given during the second MI session. Details on topics addressed in the SR
booklets are presented in Table 2
• A pedometer to register physical activity on a daily basis (steps taken) during the 3-month intervention
period. Instructions on how to use the pedometer are given during the baseline assessment session (Table 2)
• Daily activities record (Table 2): Participants received several daily activity records (physical activities,
mental activities and rest). The first daily activity record was given to the participant at the end of the first

MI session; participants were asked to fill out the activity record during the time between the first and
second MI sessions. This homework assignment aimed to evaluate participants’ daily activities management
while possibly recognising an erratic pattern of rest and activity (boom and bust cycle). At the end of the
second MI session, participants received daily activities records that could be used to monitor changes in
daily activity patterns during the subsequent 9 weeks
• Leaflet for family: At the end of the first MI session, participants received a leaflet for their partner or
significant other to increase social support

The primary outcome was the reduction in perceived fatigue severity, which was assessed by using the Checklist
of Individual Strength (CIS-20R). A difference of 7 points between intervention and control groups for the
main dimension (the subjective feeling of fatigue subscale) of the CIS-20R was considered to be clinically
significant
Starting date
The 4-STEPS RCT started in January 2011

Trial name or title
Is a multi-disciplinary rehabilitation treatment more effective than mono-disciplinary cognitive behavioural
therapy for patients with chronic fatigue syndrome? A multi-centre randomised controlled trial
Methods
RCT
Participants
Patients were included if they fulfilled the CDC-94 criteria for CFS and had a score ≥ 40 on the Checklist
of Individual Strength (CIS)-fatigue questionnaire. CDC-94 criteria for CFS are as follows
• At least 6 months of persistent or recurring fatigue for which no physical explanation was found and
that
◦ was of new onset, that is to say, it had not been lifelong
◦ was not the result of ongoing exertion
◦ was not substantially alleviated by rest and
◦ severely limited functioning
In combination with 4 or more of the following symptoms, persistent or regularly recurring over a period of
6 months and that must not have predated the fatigue
• Self-reported impairment in memory or concentration
• Sore throat
• Tender cervical lymph nodes
• Muscle pain
• Multi-joint pain
• Headache
• Unrefreshing sleep
• Postexertional malaise lasting 24 hours or longer
Additional inclusion criteria for this study follow here
• Participants are willing to participate in a treatment that is set up to change behaviour
• Participants are between 18 and 60 years of age, of either sex

(Continued)
• Participants can speak, understand and write the Dutch language
Interventions
After intake, participants will be randomly divided into 2 groups: cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and
multi-disciplinary rehabilitation therapy (MRT)
• Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT)
CBT is based on process variables of a CFS model. This model shows that high physical attributions will
decrease physical activity and increase fatigue and functional impairment. A low level of sense of control over
symptoms and focusing on physical sensations have a direct causal effect on fatigue. In CFS precipitating and
perpetuating factors are important. The perpetuating factors become the focus of the intervention in CBT.
An important subject in the therapy is the balance between activity and rest and the patients’ responsibility
to see to it. Negative beliefs regarding the symptoms of fatigue, self-expectations or self-esteem are identified
and patients are encouraged to challenge them the conventional way. Specific lifestyle changes are encouraged
if deemed appropriate. At the end of the therapy relapse prevention is addressed. Patients who are assigned
to this group will attend 16 individual therapy sessions of one hour duration, spread out over 6 months with
a psychologist or behavioural therapist
• Multi-disciplinary rehabilitation therapy (MRT): MRT includes CBT, GET, pacing and body
awareness therapy (investigational treatment)
◦ CBT: as above
◦ Graded exercise therapy (GET): structured and supervised activity management that aims at a
gradual but progressive increase in aerobic activities. It is completed by graded activity and graded exercise
in which a gradual and progressive increase in physical and mental activities is trained. Activities include
activities of daily living and occupational and social or leisure activities
◦ Pacing: helps the patient divide energy over the day/week. Eventually patients are encouraged to
carry out a gradual increase in physical and mental activity
◦ Body awareness therapy: teaches the patient to be aware of healthy physical sensations and to link
them in the mind (body mentalisation). Patients are taught to react adequately to disturbances in the
balance between daily workload and the capacity to deal with it. The balance between activity and rest is
linked to the patient’s inner control and to healthy physical sensations
MRT includes the following
• 2 weeks: observation (2 sessions of 1 hour with psychology, 2 sessions of 1 hour with a social worker, 2
sessions of 1/2 hour with occupational therapy, 2 sessions of 1/2 hour with physiotherapy)
• 2 weeks: no therapy
• 10 weeks therapy (5 sessions of 1 hour with psychology, 4 sessions of 1 hour with a social worker, 26
sessions of 1/2 hour with physiotherapy and 20 sessions of 1/2 hour with occupational therapy)
• 6 weeks: no therapy
• 1 session of 1 hour with a social worker (after 6 weeks of no therapy)
• 2 sessions of both 1/2 and 1 hour of therapy with the therapist chosen by participants
During MRT, a participant sees the physician during rehabilitation 3 times (20 minutes per visit)
Total duration of both treatments is 6 months. Duration of follow-up for both treatments is also 6 months
Outcomes
Primary outcomes
• Fatigue severity as measured using the Checklist of Individual Strength at baseline, 6 months and 12
months after start of therapy
Secondary outcomes
• Quality of life as measured using the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36)
• Psychological well-being as measured using Symptom Check List-90
• Sense of control in relation to CFS complaints as measured using a self-efficacy scale
• Somatic attributions as measured using the Causal Attribution List
• Mindfulness as measured using the Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale

(Continued)
• Functional activities (the most important) that a patient wants to improve during treatment as
measured using the Patient-Specific Complaints and Goals Questionnaire
• Impact of disease on both physical and emotional functioning as measured using the Sickness Impact
Profile
• Physical activity as measured using the Body Media Sensewear Activity Monitor
• Self-rated improvement as measured using 5 questions on the 5- and 10-point Likert scale
• Life satisfaction as measured using the Life Satisfaction Questionnaire
• Utility as measured using EuroQol 6-D
• Treatment expectancy and credibility as measured using the Devilly and Borkovec Questionnaire
All outcomes are measured at baseline and at 6 and 12 months after start of therapy. Treatment costs and
additional expenses (work-related costs, healthcare and non-healthcare costs) are measured using the Trimbos/
iMTA Questionnaire for Costs Associated With Psychiatric Illness; will be measured every month (from
baseline until 12 months after start of therapy)

Summary
The two reviews about chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) (on exercise and CBT) are important documents in a controversial field.
However, they seem to be listed on the website as mental health topics, alongside depression, etc. CFS is not a form of mental illness,
although of course individual cases may have a psychological component that can be addressed during treatment. May I suggest that
you place them elsewhere, as it is misleading and confusing to include them under the mental health umbrella?

Many thanks for your comment on the two Cochrane CFS reviews. Apologies for the delay in responding, I have been on annual
leave. We appreciate your observations about the placement of these reviews in The Cochrane Library. Feedback on reviews is normally
dealt with by the relevant review author, but in this case I am responding, as your query relates more to an organisational issue. These
reviews are listed as topics under a mental health heading because, as a result of the psychological component to which you refer,
both reviews are supported by a mental health Cochrane group. Similar arrangements are in place for reviews of treatments for other
disorders involving a variety of component problems and that as a result do not easily fit within the scope of one Cochrane group. These
reviews however can be accessed in a number of different ways, for example, by searching for the specific topic (CFS and associated
terminology, exercise and associated terminology, CBT and associated terminology); by searching for the study authors; by looking
under subject headings, etc. The subject headings are not really intended as a comment on/guide to the aetiology of an illness, but they
sometimes reflect the services involved in management of the condition. I have copied this response to the review authors in case they
wish to comment further. Many thanks for your feedback.

Summary
Unfortunately, this review ignores the large body of patient testimony suggesting that many persons with severe myalgic encephalomyeli-
tis have been harmed by graded exercise therapy.
Since it was prepared, the International Consensus Primer and Guidelines for Medical Practitioners have been published.
Current thinking is to stay within your energy envelope. People with ME tend to overdo not underdo what they are capable of....
Care must be taken to NOT encourage them to do too much.
Further many definitions are used for CFS, and this muddies the waters.

Thank you for your comments on this Cochrane Review.
In conducting this review, our aim was to gather and synthesise a specific type of evidence-that reported by randomised controlled trials.
We fully accept that patient testimony, particularly that gathered and synthesised by high-quality qualitative research, is invaluable in
any clinical area, particularly in an area as challenging for patients and healthcare professionals as CFS-ME. However, this project was
not designed to incorporate such evidence.
We do consider the possibility of harm arising from graded exercise therapy by considering reported adverse events. Clearly this is
an important issue to consider with any therapeutic intervention. Moreover, in the usual course of any illness, the condition of some
patients improves (with or without treatment) and the condition of others worsens (with or without treatment). It is only through the
use of randomised controlled trials that the effects (whether beneficial or adverse) of putative treatments can be disentangled reliably
from the natural history of illness.
You raise the important point that (some) ’people with ME tend to overdo not underdo what they are capable of.’ The critical point is
the extent to which patients should be ’encouraged to do more’ and the way in which they should be encouraged to do so. These are
important research questions. As you know, new randomised evidence is available from the PACE trial, published in 2011 in Lancet.
Whilst this is a controversial trial, it is an important randomised comparison of graded exercise therapy and ’adaptive pacing.’ We look
forward to further randomised evidence in due course.

 We also look forward to continuing to work in this clinical area, in the hope that we can advance our understanding of the impact of
this treatment approach.

Comment 1 of 2, 9 September 2015
Summary
I would first like to thank those involved for their work in preparing this document. Even for those of us who have read the individual
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) papers it is useful to have the results collated, as well as details regarding the interventions. Also it is
interesting to see the results of sensitivity analyses, subgroup analyses, standardised mean differences, etc.
I would like to make a few comments. I’m splitting them into two submissions as the piece had become very long. I’ve added some
loose headings to hopefully make it more readable.
Objective measures
The review assessed the studies as having a high risk of bias regarding blinding, since neither participants nor assessors were blinded.
Evidence suggests that subjective outcomes are more prone to bias than objective outcomes when there is no blinding (1). It is thus
unfortunate that the review concentrated almost exclusively on subjective measures, failing to include results from nearly all the objective
outcome measures that have been published with trials. (The exception was health resource use for which you presented follow-up data
from one trial).
I hope objective outcome data can be included in a future revision or edition of this review.
Examples of objective outcomes include: exercise testing (work capacity by oxygen consumption); fitness test/step test; the six minute
walking test; employment status; and disability payments.
Adding in these results would allow a more rigorous assessment of the effectiveness and relevance of the therapies, their causal
mechanisms, therapeutic compliance, and safety.
On exercise testing, for example, in the PACE Trial (the largest trial in the review) there was no improvement in fitness levels as measured
by a step test (2). The fitness data contrasts sharply with the many positive results from subjective self-report measures in the trial, so
one is left wondering how much the subjective measures reflect reality.
On another exercise test used in the PACE Trial, the 6 minute walk test, there was a small (mean) increase from 312 metres at baseline
to 379 metres at 12 months: this was 35.3 metres more than the ”passive“ control group when adjustments were made. However, the
final result of 379 metres remains very poor compared to the more than 600 metres one would expect from healthy people of a similar
age and gender make-up (3,4). By comparison, a group with Class III heart failure walked an average of 402 metres (5). A score of less
than 400 metres has been suggested as the level at which somebody should be put on a lung transplant list (6). Such information from
objective measures helps to add important context to the subjective measures and restraint to the conclusions that can be drawn from
them.
Objective data is also needed to check compliance with a therapy. If patients diligently exercised for 12 months one would expect much
better results on fitness and exercise testing than the aforementioned results in the PACE Trial. This is important when considering
adverse events and safety: such trials may not give us good information on the safety of complying with such interventions if patients
haven’t actually complied.
Employment and receipt of disability payments are practical objective measures of general functional capacity so data on them would
help establish whether patients can actually do more overall or whether they may just be doing, for example, a little more exercise
but have substituted that for doing less in other areas (7,8). Also, CFS patients are sometimes pressured by insurance companies into
doing graded exercise therapy (GET) programs so it would be useful to have data collated on employment outcomes to see whether
pressure can in any way be justified (9,10). In the PACE Trial, there was no significant improvement in employment measures and
receipt of disability payments in the GET group (11). Outside the realm of clinical trials, the quantitative and qualitative data in a
major (UK) ME Association survey also found that GET didn’t lead to higher levels of employment and lower levels of receipt of
disability payments on average (9). Also, extensive external audits were performed of Belgian CFS rehabilitation clinics that treated
using cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and GET. The main reports are in French and Dutch (12,13), with an English summary
113

 available (14) that says, ”Employment status decreased at the end of the therapy, from an average of 18.3% of a 38h working week,
to 14.9% [...] The percentage of patients living from a sickness allowance increased slightly from 54 to 57%.“ This contrasts with the
average improvements reported in the audit for some symptoms like fatigue.
While data on (self-reported) symptoms like fatigue (one of your two primary outcomes) is interesting, arguably more important to
patients is improving their overall level of functioning (and again, objective measures are needed here). Being able to work, for example,
despite experiencing a certain level of fatigue would likely be more important for many than being unable to work but having slightly
lower levels of fatigue.
An example of how reductions in the reported levels of fatigue may not lead to improvements in functioning can be seen in an analysis
of three graded activity-oriented CBT therapy interventions for CFS (15). The analysis showed, compared to controls, there were
no improvements in overall activity levels as measured by actometers despite improvements in self-reported fatigue (15). Activity in
these trials was assessed using actometers. Another study that exemplifies the problem of focusing too much on fatigue scores after
behavioural interventions is a study of CBT in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with “MS fatigue”(16). The study found that following
the intervention, patients with MS reported significantly lower (i.e. better) scores on the Chalder Fatigue Scale (0-33 scoring) than those
in a healthy, nonfatigued comparison group! This significant difference was maintained at 3 and 6 months’ follow-up. It is difficult to
believe that patients with MS fatigue (at baseline) truly subsequently had less fatigue than healthy nonfatigued controls: a much more
likely scenario is that undertaking the intervention had led to response biases.
You mention that ”many patient charities are opposed to exercise therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)“. One reason for concern
about the way in which exercise programmes are promoted to patients is that they are often based upon models which assume that
there is no abnormal physiological response to exercise in the condition, and make unsupported claims to patients. For example, in
the FINE trial (Wearden et al., 2010) patient booklet (17), it is boldly asserted that: ”Activity or exercise cannot harm you“ (p. 49).
However, a large number of studies have found abnormal responses to exercise, and the possibility of harm being done simply cannot
be excluded on the basis of current evidence (discussed in 4, 18-20).”
Compliance
The review doesn’t include any information on compliance. I’m not sure that there is much published information on this but I know
there was a measure based on attendance at therapy sessions (which could be conducted over the phone) given for the PACE Trial (3).
Ideally, it would be interesting if you could obtain some unpublished data from activity logs, records from heart-rate monitors, and
other records to help build up a picture of what exercise was actually performed and the level of compliance. Information on adherence
and what exercise was actually done is important in terms of helping clinicians, and indeed patients, to interpret and use the data. I
mention patients because patients’ own decisions about their behaviour is likely to be affected by the medical information available
to them, both within and outside of a supervised programme of graded exercise; unlike with an intervention like a drug, patients can
undertake exercise without professional supervision.
“Selective reporting (outcome bias)” and White et al. (2011)
I don’t believe that White et al. (2011) (the PACE Trial) (3) should be classed as having a low risk of bias under “Selective reporting
(outcome bias)” (Figure 2, page 15). According to the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias (21), the category of low
risk of bias is for: “The study protocol is available and all of the study’s pre-specified (primary and secondary) outcomes that are of
interest in the review have been reported in the pre-specified way”. This is not the case in the PACE Trial. The three primary efficacy
outcomes can be seen in the published protocol (22). None have been reported in the pre-specified way. The Cochrane Collaboration’s
tool for assessing risk of bias states that a “high risk” of bias applies if any one of several criteria are met, including that “not all of
the study’s pre-specified primary outcomes have been reported” or “one or more primary outcomes is reported using measurements,
analysis methods or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not pre-specified”. In the PACE Trial, the third primary outcome
measure (the number of “overall improvers”) was never published. Also, the other two primary outcome measures were reported using
analysis methods that were not pre-specified (including switching from the bimodal to the Likert scoring method for The Chalder
Fatigue Scale, one of the primary outcomes in your review). These facts mean that the “high risk of bias” category should apply.
Thank you for taking the time to read my comments.

Thank you for reading the review so carefully and for your comments. I have split the answers according to the headings you have used.
Objective measures and compliance
The protocol for this review did not include objective measurements or compliance as outcomes, hence are not included. You make a
strong case and including objective measures and compliance should be carefully considered in an update.
Selective reporting (outcome bias)
The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool enables the review authors to be transparent about their judgments, but due to the subjective nature
of the process it does not guarantee an indisputable consensus. You particularly mention the risk of bias in the PACE trial regarding
not providing pre-specified outcomes however the trial did pre-specify the analysis of outcomes. The primary outcomes were the same
as in the original protocol, although the scoring method of one was changed and the analysis of assessing efficacy also changed from
the original protocol. These changes were made as part of the detailed statistical analysis plan (itself published in full), which had been
promised in the original protocol. These changes were drawn up before the analysis commenced and before examining any outcome
data. In other words they were pre-specified, so it is hard to understand how the changes contributed to any potential bias. The relevant
paper also alerted readers to all these changes and gave the reasons for them. Overall, we don’t think that the issues you raise with regard
to the risk of selective outcome bias are such as to suspect high risk of bias, but recognize that you may reach different conclusions than
us.

Comment 2 of 2, 9 September 2015
Summary
Variation in interventions
It would have been useful to have some more information on the “exercise with pacing” intervention tested in the Wallman et al. (2004)
trial and how it was distinct from some other exercise interventions tested. The authors say (1): “On days when symptoms are worse,
patients should either shorten the session to a time they consider manageable or, if feeling particularly unwell, abandon the session
altogether” (p. 143). I don’t believe the description given in the review conveys this. In the review, this approach is described as “Exercise
with pacing: exercise in which the incremental increase in exercise was personally set.” But Wallman et al.’s approach allows patients
to decrease as well as increase how much exercise they do on the day. This approach also contrasts with how White (an investigator
in two of the trials) has described graded exercise therapy: “if [after increasing the intensity or duration of exercise] there has been an
increase in symptoms, or any other adverse effects, they should stay at their current level of exercise for a further week or two, until the
symptoms are back to their previous levels” (2). In the PACE Trial manual White co-wrote (3), the GET intervention was guided by
the principle that “planned physical activity and not symptoms are used to determine what the participant does” (p. 21); similarly, “it
is their planned physical activity, and not their symptoms, that determine what they are asked to do” (p. 20). Compliance data would
help us examine which approach patients are actually using: I suspect many patients are in fact doing exercise with pacing even in trials
such as the PACE Trial (i.e. when they have increased symptoms, often reducing levels of exercise and sometimes doing no exercise
activities at all on that day).
Bimodal versus Likert scoring in Wearden et al. (2010)
I find it odd that the fatigue scores for the Wearden et al. (2010) trial (4) are given in the 0-33 format rather than the 0-11 scoring
method. The 0-11 scoring system is what is mentioned as a primary outcome measure in the protocol and is what is reported in the
main paper reporting the results (4, 5). It is even what your own report says on p. 44 is the scoring method (“Fatigue Scale, FS; 11
items; each item was scored dichotomously on a 4-point scale [0, 0, 1 or 1]”). This is important because using the scoring method for
which you don’t report data (0-11), there is no statistically significant difference at the primary outcome point of 70 weeks (5).
Diagnostic criteria
One problem with using these trials as an evidence base, which I don’t believe was mentioned, is that all the trials used the Oxford and
Fukuda diagnostic criteria (6, 7). Neither of these criteria require patients to have post-exertional malaise (or something similar). Many
116

 consider this to be a core symptom of ME/CFS and it is mandatory in most of the other major criteria (8-11). [Aside: The London
criteria were assessed in the PACE Trial (12) but they seem to have been operationalised in an unusual way. Ninety seven per cent of
the participants who satisfied the (broad) Oxford criteria who didn’t have a psychiatric disorder satisfied the definition of M.E. used
(13). Ellen Goudsmit, one of the authors of the London criteria, has rejected the way they were used in the PACE Trial (14)]. So this
lack of requirement for patients to have post-exertional malaise (or a similar description) means we cannot be sure that the evidence
can be generalised to such patients. An independent National Institutes of Health committee this year concluded “continuing to use
the Oxford definition may impair progress and cause harm. Therefore, for progress to occur, we recommend that this definition be
retired” (15). An Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality review of diagnostic methods this year reached a similar conclusion:
“Consensus groups and researchers should consider retiring the Oxford case definition because it differs from the other case definitions
and is the least restrictive, probably including individuals with other overlapping conditions” (16). An Agency for Healthcare Research
and Quality review of ME/CFS treatments said: ”The Oxford CFS case definition is the least restrictive, and its use as entry criteria
could have resulted in selection of participants with other fatiguing illnesses or illnesses that resolve spontaneously with time“ (17).
Exclusion of some data from analyses due to baseline differences
It seems unfortunate that some data cannot be used due to baseline differences e.g. ”Four trials (669 participants) contributed data for
evaluation of physical functioning at follow-up (Jason 2007; Powell 2001; Wearden 2010; White 2011). Jason 2007 observed better
results among participants in the relaxation group (MD 21.48, 95% CI 5.81 to 37.15). However, results were distorted by large baseline
differences in physical functioning between the exercise and relaxation groups (39/100 vs 54/100); therefore we decided not to include
these results in the meta-analysis“. It would be good if other methods could be investigated (e.g. using baseline levels as covariates) to
analyse such data.
Thank you for taking the time to read my comments.

Variation in interventions
There is ongoing work to improve descriptions of interventions both in primary studies and in systematic reviews (Scroter 2012,
Glasziou 2008). We tried to describe the exercise programs, and differences between them in great detail. We did this both in the tables
of study characteristics, and in the Characteristics of exercise intervention table (table 2). We also contacted trial authors to check that
the information was correct. We recognize the need for more research to explore which parts of an exercise treatment program that are
most essential or most closely correlated to an successful outcome, i.e. the active ingredient.
Bimodal versus Likert scoring in Wearden et al. 2010
To enable pooling of as many studies as possible in a mean difference meta-analyses, we used the 33-scale results reported by Wearden.
You suggest that the decision to use the 33-point fatigue scores in our analysis may bias the results because there is no statistically
significant difference at the 11-point data at 70 weeks. This statement suggests that there is a statistically significant difference when
using the 33-point data, but if you look into analysis 1.2 that is not the case. At 70 week we report MD -2.12 (95% CI -4.49 to 0.25)
for the FINE trial, i.e. not statistically significant.
Review authors response: Diagnostic criteria
As the use of various diagnostic criteria is often emphasised as particularly important with regard to treatment response, we performed
subgroup analyses based on diagnostic criteria. The availability of relevant trials limits which subgroup analyses are possible to carry
out in a systematic review, and hence, we were only able to contrast CDC versus Oxford criteria and found no evidence for a difference.
We realize that the role of diagnostic criteria as a possible moderator for the efficacy of exercise receives a lot of attention, and would
welcome trials to investigate these matters more thoroughly.
Exclusion of some data from analyses due to baseline differences
In meta-analysis based on aggregated data the authors have to act based on the information that is available from original publications
or additional information obtained from the original investigators. As you state, these restrictions may be suboptimal. It is possible to
adjust for baseline differences in meta-regression type analyses, but this requires adjustment for dependency between the intervention
and control group results from the same trial. As a consequence, three variables (intervention vs control, baseline level, and trial) would
have to be accounted for in the analyses. This implies that at least 30 data points will be needed to gain somewhat stable and trustworthy
estimates adjusted for baseline levels. Systematic reviews based on individual patient data (IPD) allows for more appropriate processing
and standardization of data. We are happy to inform you that we have now received individual patient data from most of the studies
included in this review, and that the preparation of an IPD review is in progress.

Summary
Query regarding use of post-hoc unpublished outcome data: Scoring system for the Chalder fatigue scale, Wearden, 2010
I would like to highlight what appears to be a discrepancy within the Cochrane review [1] with respect to the analysis of data from
Wearden 2010 [2,3].
Throughout the Cochrane review (please see details below), the impression is given that only protocol defined and published data or
outcomes were used for the Cochrane analysis of the Wearden 2010 study.
However, this does not appear to be the case and, to the best of my knowledge, instead of using protocol defined or published data,
the Cochrane analyses of fatigue for the Wearden 2010 study, appears to have used an alternative unpublished set of data.
The relevant analyses of fatigue in the Cochrane review are: Analyses: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1 and 2.3. Each of these analyses states that the
“0,1,2,3” scoring system was used for the Chalder fatigue questionnaire. This scoring system is known as the Likert scoring system and
uses a fatigue scale of 033
points.
However, to the best of my knowledge, data or analyses using this scoring system were not proposed in the Wearden 2010 trial protocol
[3], and were not included in Wearden 2010 [2], and have not previously been formally (i.e. via peer review) published by Wearden et
al. A posthoc informal analysis using this data has been informally released by Wearden et al. as a BMJ Rapid Response comment [4].
In the Cochrane review, the analyses using the 0, 1, 2, 3 scoring system contradict text within the section “Characteristics Of Studies”,
in relation to Wearden 2010: Under “Outcomes”, it is stated that Chalder fatigue was measured using the 0,0,1,1 scoring system using
a scale from 011 points: “Fatigue (Fatigue Scale, FS
11 items
each item was scored dichotomously on a 4 point scale (0, 0, 1 or 1)”.
Wearden 2010 prespecified Chalder fatigue questionnaire scores as a primary outcome at 70 weeks, and as a secondary outcome
immediately after treatment at 20 weeks. The scoring, in both cases, used the 0,0,1,1 system, with a scale of 011. This scoring system
was described both in the trial protocol [3] and the main results paper published in 2010 [2].
The Likert (0, 1, 2, 3) scoring system was neither proposed in the trial protocol, nor formally published, and so the Likert scores should
be considered posthoc. Even if it is argued that the Chalder fatigue questionnaire (irrespective of the scoring system) was predefined as
a primary outcome measure, data using the Likert scoring system was neither proposed nor published and so the data itself must surely
be considered to be posthoc. The outcome analyses using the Likert data must be considered posthoc.
Simply changing a scoring system may, at first glance, appear not to be a significant or major adjustment, however, we do not know
what difference it made because a sensitivity analysis has not been published.
I cannot find any explanation within the Cochrane review that explains why the Cochrane review has replaced predefined published
data with an unpublished and posthoc set of data.
Is it normal practice for a Cochrane metaanalysis to selectively ignore the predefined primary outcome data for a trial, and to selectively
include and analyse posthoc data? I wonder if some clarity could be shed on this situation?
I suggest that the posthoc data are replaced with the original published data. Otherwise, the posthoc data should be clearly labelled
as such and the risk of bias analysis amended accordingly
and an explanation should be included in the review explaining why an
apparently adequate predefined set of data has been replaced with an apparent novel set of posthoc data.
Also, I suggest that any discrepancies that I will outline below, should be corrected where necessary
Either the analyses (1.1, 1.2, 2.1
and 2.3) should be amended or the description of the data should be amended so it is not incorrectly labelled as protocol defined and
published data with a “low risk” of bias.
Discrepancies within the text of the Cochrane Analysis
Please note that all page numbers used below are pertinent to the current version (version 4) of the Cochrane review in PDF format.
1. On page 28 of the Cochrane review [1], in section “Potential biases in the review process”, under the heading “Potential bias in the
review process”, in relation to the review in general, it is stated that: ”For this updated review, we have not collected unpublished data
for our outcomes ...“ However, as explained above, this is not the case for the Wearden 2010 fatigue data for which unpublished data
has been used in the Cochrane analysis.
2. On page 45 of the review, in section “Characteristics Of Studies”, specifically in relation to Wearden 2010 [2,3], it is stated that only
protocol defined
outcomes were used: ”all relevant outcomes are reported in accordance with the protocol“. ”Selective reporting (reporting bias)“ is rated
as ”low risk“. However, as explained above, this is not the case, because the Wearden 2010 fatigue data (used in the Cochrane analysis)
was not proposed in the
119

 protocol. If the data is posthoc, then the “low risk” category will need to be revised.
3. On page 44 of the review, in section “Characteristics Of Studies”, in relation to Wearden 2010 [2,3], under “Outcomes”, it is stated
that Chalder fatigue was measured using the 0,0,1,1 scoring system using a scale from 011 points: “Fatigue (Fatigue Scale, FS
11
items
each item was scored dichotomously on a 4 point scale (0, 0, 1 or 1)”. Wearden 2010 did indeed use the 0,0,1,1 scoring system
for the Chalder fatigue scale: This scoring system was proposed in the trial protocol and published with the main outcome data in
Wearden 2010. However, as explained above, this scoring system has not been used in the Cochrane analysis.
4. If figures 2 and 3 also contain discrepancies, after any amendments to the review, then they should be amended accordingly.
There may be other related discrepancies and inaccuracies in the text that I haven’t noticed. I thank the Cochrane team in advance
for giving this submission careful consideration, and for making amendments to the analysis, and providing explanations, where
appropriate. I hope you will agree that clarity, transparency and accuracy in relation to the analysis is paramount.

Dear Robert Courtney
Thank you for your detailed comments on the Cochrane review ’Exercise Therapy for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome’. We have the greatest
respect for your right to comment on and disagree with our work. We take our work as researchers extremely seriously and publish
reports that have been subject to rigorous internal and external peer review. In the spirit of openness, transparency and mutual respect
we must politely agree to disagree.
The Chalder Fatigue Scale was used to measure fatigue. The results from the Wearden 2010 trial show a statistically significant difference
in favour of pragmatic rehabilitation at 20 weeks, regardless whether the results were scored bi-modally or on a scale from 0-3. The
effect estimate for the 70 week comparison with the scale scored bi-modally was -1.00 (CI-2.10 to +0.11; p =.076) and -2.55 (-4.99
to -0.11; p=.040) for 0123 scoring. The FINE data measured on the 33-point scale was published in an online rapid response after
a reader requested it. We therefore knew that the data existed, and requested clarifying details from the authors to be able to use the
estimates in our meta-analysis. In our unadjusted analysis the results were similar for the scale scored bi-modally and the scale scored
from 0 to 3, i.e. a statistically significant difference in favour of rehabilitation at 20 weeks and a trend that does not reach statistical
significance in favour of pragmatic rehabilitation at 70 weeks. The decision to use the 0123 scoring did does not affect the conclusion
of the review.

Summary
Comment: Assessment of Selective Reporting Bias in White 2011
With reference to the current Cochrane review of exercise therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome [1], I would like to follow-up the
discussion between Tom Kindlon and Lillebeth Larun that has been published in the latest version of the full review published in 2016.
Kindlon submitted two comments, dated 9 September 2016, and Larun issued a response to each.
Kindlon raised the issue of the study referred to as ”White 2011“ in the Cochrane review, commonly known as the PACE trial [2];
specifically whether or not the risk of bias for selective reporting of outcomes for the trial has been assessed and categorised appropriately,
in terms of Cochrane’s guidelines and policies.
In this submission I will make reference to the current ”Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions“ [3], including
Table 8.5.d (”Criteria for judging risk of bias in the ‘Risk of bias’ assessment tool“), which I will refer to as the ”Cochrane guidelines“.
In his submission, Kindlon said: ”I don’t believe that White et al. (2011) (the PACE Trial) [...] should be classed as having a low risk
of bias under “Selective reporting (outcome bias)”.“
In a considered response, Larun concluded: ”Overall, we don’t think that the issues you raise with regard to the risk of selective outcome
bias are such as to suspect high risk of bias, but recognize that you may reach different conclusions than us.“
Larun’s response to the concerns raised by Kindlon has left me unsure about whether Cochrane’s guidelines have been applied appro-
priately in this case, so I would like to discuss some of the finer details.
Pre-Planned Analysis
I note that the PACE trial’s protocol was submitted for publication in 2006 and published in 2007 [4], which was after the trial had
commenced in 2005 [2]. This raises the question of whether the protocol itself can be defined as a pre-trial report. Cochrane’s glossary
of terms defines a ”pre-specified“ analysis as a ”Statistical analyses specified in the trial protocol; that is, planned in advance of data
collection.“ [5] So the Cochrane glossary states that a pre-specified analysis plan, or protocol, must be completed before data collection
has commenced.
Other sources, such as the Wiley Encyclopedia of Clinical Trials, also define a pre-planned analysis as that which has been defined
before data collection has commenced: ”A primary efficacy endpoint needs to be specified before the start of the clinical trial.“ [6]
To be certain that the PACE trial’s analyses were defined before data collection had commenced then we would need an earlier publication
such as a trial register [7] or trial identifier, both of which were created and which included definitions of primary endpoints which
were different to the trial protocol (see appendix, below, for detailed descriptions). To my knowledge, the Cochrane review, does not
discuss these issues.
Nevertheless, the Cochrane guidelines (section 8.14.2) advise using a trial protocol as a guide to determine which trial outcomes were
pre-determined: ”If the protocol is available, then outcomes in the protocol and published report can be compared“.
As the protocol was published after the trial had commenced, it seems certain that any subsequent (i.e. after the protocol had been
published) changes to methodology were made after data collection had commenced and were therefore not pre-specified.
Statistical Analysis Plan
Larun states that various changes from the protocol were ”made as part of the detailed statistical analysis plan (itself published in
full), which had been promised in the original protocol.“ The protocol did indeed refer to a statistical analysis plan, but the protocol
wording suggests to me that no changes from the protocol were planned, but that the statistical analysis plan would simply flesh out
the protocol: ”A full Analysis Strategy will be developed, independently of looking at the trial database, and before undertaking any
analysis. This paper [i.e. the protocol] summarises the analysis plan.“ There was no suggestion that there would be wholesale changes
to primary, secondary or recovery outcomes. But, in any case, even if the investigators’ initial intentions had been to make changes after
data collection had started, the result would still not be a pre-specified analysis according to the Cochrane glossary of terms [5].
The statistical analysis plan was submitted for publication in 2012 and published in 2013 [8] after the main trial results had been
published in 2011 [2], and long after the trial had commenced in 2005, so the statistical analysis plan cannot reasonably be considered
to be a priori. Indeed the statistical analysis report itself confirms that the analysis was finalised or approved towards the end of data
collection in 2010: ”These planned analyses were written with a view to publication and are reproduced almost as they were approved
by the Trial Steering Committee (Version 1.2 dated 2 May 2010) prior to database lock.“
Larun states that the ”changes [to the trial] were drawn up before the analysis commenced and before examining any outcome data.
In other words they were pre-specified [...]“ However, the latter assertion is not consistent with Cochrane’s glossary, which states that
pre-specified changes are those defined before data collection has commenced [5].

 Investigators of an open-label trial can potentially gain insights into a trial before formal analysis has been carried out. If changes to
a planned methodology are made after a trial has started and/or after data collection has commenced (whether or not the data has
been formally analysed) then it is generally accepted that this fails the definition of a ”pre-specified“ study, which is confirmed by the
Cochrane glossary and other sources. Otherwise trial registries and protocols could be drawn up after all data had been collected but
before the formal analysis has commenced, and still be described as pre-planned. This would be particularly problematic in open-label
trials such as the PACE trial.
Pre-Planned and Unplanned Primary Endpoints
The PACE trial’s protocol had proposed three primary efficacy analyses which all had binary outcomes (i.e. a positive or negative
outcome for each patient), whereas the final primary analyses were entirely different; they were continuous measures focused on the
differences in mean improvements between intervention groups at 52 weeks. So the changes to the protocol were substantial. (See
appendix, below, for detailed descriptions.) The PACE trial’s three a priori primary efficacy analyses were not included in the final
published results, and have never been published and, to my knowledge, no sensitivity analysis has been published for the final published
primary analyses.
The PACE trial’s published results paper [2] confirmed the unplanned outcome switching, as follows: ”We used continuous scores
for primary outcomes to allow a more straightforward interpretation of the individual outcomes, instead of the originally planned
composite measures (50% change or meeting a threshold score).“
This entirely contradicts Larun’s claims that: ”the trial did pre-specify the analysis of outcomes“ and: ”The primary outcomes were the
same as in the original protocol“.
The Cochrane guidelines give guidance that is specific to the issue of changing a pre-planned analysis for the same set of data and they
describe such an action as ”selective reporting of analyses using the same data“. The guidelines couldn’t be more specific that changing
a method for analysing the same set of data should be considered selective reporting.
The Cochrane guidelines (8.14.1) state: ”Selective reporting of analyses using the same data: There are often several different ways
in which an outcome can be analysed. For example, continuous outcomes such as blood pressure reduction might be analysed as a
continuous or dichotomous variable, with the further possibility of selecting from multiple cut-points.“
Scoring System for Chalder Fatigue
A change from the protocol, that will have had a direct impact on the Cochrane analysis, was the scoring system used for the Chalder
fatigue scale. The PACE trial protocol proposed two self-report questionnaires as tools to use for the primary endpoint analyses: one
was the Chalder fatigue questionnaire, and the other was the Short Form 36 (SF-36) physical function subscale. The scoring system
for the Chalder fatigue questionnaire was pre-defined as a bimodal scoring system (i.e. a score of 0 or 1 for each response to the 11
questions, giving a fatigue scale of 0-11). However, after data collection had commenced, the decision was to made to change to a
continuous scoring system, known as the Likert system (i.e. a score of 0 ,1, 2, or 3 for each response to the 11 questions, giving a fatigue
scale of 0-33). This change was made after the PACE trial’s nominal ’sister trial’, known as the FINE trial, had completed its analysis
of very similar type of data using both the bimodal and Likert scoring systems. The FINE trial investigators had found no significant
effect for their primary endpoint when using the bimodal scoring system for Chalder fatigue [9] but determined a significant effect
using the Likert system in an informal post-hoc analysis [10]. The FINE trial has published its raw data, as part of the PLoS One data
sharing commitment, and an informal analysis has shown that there may potentially be other significant differences in some outcomes,
when changing from bimodal to Likert scoring [11].
With regards to risk of selective reporting bias specifically in relation to the PACE trial, the Cochrane review states: “Our primary
interest is the primary outcome reported in accordance with the protocol, so we do not believe that selective reporting is a problem.”
However, the Likert scoring system for the Chalder fatigue questionnaire is clearly labelled as a secondary outcome in the PACE trial
protocol, and not a primary outcome. The protocol specifically lists “Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire Likert scoring (0,1,2,3)” as a
“secondary outcome” only. This contradicts the above statement in the review (i.e. “our primary interest is the primary outcome reported
in accordance with the protocol”), and it contradicts Larun’s implied assertion that the Likert scoring system was “pre-specified” for
use as a primary outcome measure.
So, to reiterate, the Likert scoring system, that the Cochrane review has described as a primary outcome measure, is specifically described
as only a secondary measure in the PACE trial’s protocol. It could not be more specific.
The change in questionnaire scoring methods is more than just a technicality, and may have made a significant difference to the trial’s
outcomes [11]. The rationale for the change (i.e. “to more sensitively test our hypotheses of effectiveness”) may or may not be justified,
and the change may or may not be beneficial in terms of better understanding treatment effects, but the fact remains that it was not
part of a pre-specified trial plan.
Considering the issues discussed above, the analysis of the Chalder fatigue scores in the Cochrane review should undoubtedly, in my
opinion, be considered an unplanned analysis and labelled as such.
Sensitivity Analysis
122
Exercise therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome (Review)
Copyright © 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 The Cochrane review focused on the mean differences between intervention groups, and whether there was a statistically significant
effect, which is the same analysis as the PACE trial’s final published outcomes.
Analyses of the PACE trial data using the pre-planned methods have not been published and, to my knowledge, a sensitivity analysis
for the (unplanned) final outcomes has neither been published in the PACE trial literature nor the Cochrane review, so it is impossible
for the reader to have insight into the impact of the changes.
In terms of what should be done when only post-hoc data is available the Cochrane guidelines (section 8.14.2) advise that a sensitivity
analysis should be published: “It is not generally recommended to try to ‘adjust for’ reporting bias in the main meta-analysis. Sensitivity
analysis is a better approach to investigate the possible impact of selective outcome reporting (Hutton 2000, Williamson 2005a).”
It would be helpful if this guideline was adhered to.
Assessment of Risk of Reporting Bias
As well as those outlined above, various other important outcomes in the trial were changed dramatically, such as the recovery analysis,
which was reported in a separate publication [12]. Also, the pre-defined ’clinically important difference’ was dropped, and was replaced
with a ’clinically useful difference’ which had an entirely different definition. There were too many deviations from the protocol in the
final analyses to list them all in detail here.
The Cochrane guidelines (8.14.2) state: “The assessment of risk of bias due to selective reporting of outcomes should be made for the
study as a whole, rather than for each outcome. Although it may be clear for a particular study that some specific outcomes are subject
to selective reporting while others are not, we recommend the study-level approach because it is not practical to list all fully reported
outcomes in the ‘Risk of bias’ table.”
The Cochrane review currently designates the risk of reporting bias for the PACE trial as “low risk”: Under the subheading “Character-
istics of included studies” and under: “Selective reporting (reporting bias)”, White 2011 is designated as “Low risk”. This designation
is repeated elsewhere in the review, such as the “Risk of bias summary” in Figure 2.
Kindlon pointed out that the Cochrane guidelines (Table 8.5.d) set out the criteria for the judgement of high risk of reporting bias as
follows:
“Any one of the following:
• Not all of the study’s pre-specified primary outcomes have been reported;
• One or more primary outcomes is reported using measurements, analysis methods or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that
were not pre-specified;
• One or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified (unless clear justification for their reporting is provided, such as
an unexpected adverse effect);
• One or more outcomes of interest in the review are reported incompletely so that they cannot be entered in a meta-analysis;
• The study report fails to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study.”
I consider the trial to meet at least the first three of these requirements for a high risk of bias. However, in the response to Kindlon,
Larun says: “Overall, we don’t think that the issues you raise with regard to the risk of selective outcome bias are such as to suspect high
risk of bias, but recognize that you may reach different conclusions than us.”
I find this claim impossible to square with the Cochrane risk of bias tool, for which, in my opinion, the PACE trial unambiguously
meets at least three high risk criteria when only one is required to label the study as high risk.
The Cochrane guidelines advise that the bias risk of a study should be assessed by taking into account the study as a whole; and as all of
the PACE trial’s main published analyses, including the primary analyses and the recovery analysis, were not pre-planned, this suggests
that the Cochrane report should have labelled the trial as having a high risk of reporting bias, according to my interpretation of the
Cochrane guidelines.
I request that a revaluation is carried out, with reference to the Cochrane guidelines.
Definition of a Primary Endpoint
In his submission to Cochrane, Kindlon explained that the three pre-planned primary endpoint analyses were abandoned in favour of
novel analyses in the final trial analysis: “The three primary efficacy outcomes can be seen in the published protocol” and “None have
been reported in the pre-specified way.
I find Larun’s response to Kindlon to be confusing and unsatisfactory. As far as my understanding goes, the response does not seem
to take account of the Cochrane guidelines. Larun acknowledges that the scoring system for one of the primary outcome assessment
tools, was changed: ”the scoring method of one was changed“, and she acknowledges that the trial’s primary endpoint analyses were
changed: ”the analysis of assessing efficacy also changed from the original protocol.“
However, Larun seems to contradict this by saying: ”The [final] primary outcomes were the same as in the original protocol [...]“
123
Exercise therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome (Review)
Copyright © 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Larun’s latter statement contradicts the published results which state that the ”originally planned“ ”primary outcomes“ were switched:
”We used continuous scores for primary outcomes [...] instead of the originally planned composite measures (50% change or meeting
a threshold score).“ [2]
The primary endpoints (i.e. criteria to judge a successful outcome) were defined in precise detail rather than simply being described as
’fatigue’ and ’physical function’. Instead, a specific primary endpoint efficacy analysis was defined which included a required threshold
for a positive outcome in fatigue and function at 52 weeks. Also, the questionnaire and scoring method was defined for each primary
endpoint.
As the primary endpoint analyses were changed then I would argue that the primary outcomes were substantially changed.
A ”primary efficacy endpoint“ has been described as ”a clinical or laboratory outcome measured in an individual after randomization
that allows one to test the primary hypothesis and provides the means of assessing whether a therapy is effective compared with its
control.“ [6]
An example of ”Completely defined pre-specified primary and secondary outcome measures, including how and when they were
assessed“ is given in the Consort guidelines: ”Example-“The primary endpoint with respect to efficacy in psoriasis was the proportion
of patients achieving a 75% improvement in psoriasis activity from baseline to 12 weeks as measured by the PASI [psoriasis area and
severity index] Additional analyses were done on the percentage change in PASI scores and improvement in target psoriasis lesions“
[13]
In the PACE trial the primary objectives were to compare CBT and GET against SMC. To effectively achieve this comparison, a specific
primary analysis was provided, as the primary endpoint, to determine a successful outcome. The results for the pre-planned primary
endpoints have not been released.
Conclusion
Larun says: ”The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool enables the review authors to be transparent about their judgments, but due to the
subjective nature of the process it does not guarantee an indisputable consensus.“
I accept that assessment of bias can be subjective but, as I have outlined above, the issues relating to the PACE trial seem clear-cut,
according to the Cochrane guidelines, which give very specific advice in relation to the type of the changes that we see here. I do not
accept Larun’s suggestion that this is a nuanced or subjective evaluation. PACE seems to fail at least the first three criteria in the ’high
risk’ category of the Cochrane risk tool for reporting bias.
The changes to the PACE trial’s primary outcomes had the effect of lowering the threshold for a positive outcome and therefore
portraying the interventions in a more positive light. A major purpose of a trial protocol is to avoid bias that can potentially arise
through selective reporting. Avoidable bias does a disservice for the medical and patient communities and I would expect Cochrane to
be rigorous in pointing out potential bias, and discussing the implications of bias, labelling bias correctly and including unbiased data
where possible or including a sensitively analysis where possible. Indeed, this is what the Cochrane guidelines advise, and it is what the
public expect of Cochrane. I feel that these issues have been neglected in this specific instance, and a reader of the Cochrane review in
isolation would be unaware of any of the issues discussed above, relating to the PACE trial.
I ask for a reassessment and revaluation of this review in relation to the PACE trial and risk of bias.
Many thanks, in advance, for your careful consideration of these issues.

Dear Robert Courtney
Thank you for your detailed comments on the Cochrane review ’Exercise Therapy for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome’. We have the greatest
respect for your right to comment on and disagree with our work. We take our work as researchers extremely seriously and publish
reports that have been subject to rigorous internal and external peer review. In the spirit of openness, transparency and mutual respect
we must politely agree to disagree.
Cochrane reviews aim to report the review process in a transparent way, for example, are reasons for the risk of bias stated. We do not
agree that Risk of Bias for the Pace trial (White 2011) should be changed, but have presented it in a way so it is possible to see our
reasoning. We find that we have been quite careful in stating the effect estimates and the certainty of the documentation. We note that
you read this differently.

Summary
Comment: concerns regarding the use of unplanned primary outcomes in the Cochrane review
Summary
In this submission, I will discuss the details and implications of unplanned revisions to the Cochrane review’s protocol, specifically
changes to the primary outcomes. I will raise concerns about the clarity with which the changes to the protocol have been explained
in the review and I will question the justification given for switching the primary outcomes. I will compare the details of the pre-
specified primary outcomes with the unplanned (revised) primary outcomes. I will explore how the protocol revisions have impacted the
overall conclusions of the review, and how some review outcomes have been misrepresented in the main discussions. I will also briefly
discuss potential biases involved in reviewing open-label studies that use self-report outcomes, and how such biases may potentially have
affected the review’s outcomes. Finally, I will discuss what I believe is: a lack of clarity in how the review has discussed and portrayed
outcomes, and; a lack of depth in how potential biases have been considered and explored.
I will conclude by asking the reviewers to reassess the review, including the decision to switch the primary outcomes, with a view to
improving clarity, rigour and accuracy. I specifically ask the reviewers to:
1. Amend the review as per the Cochrane guidelines (i.e. “every effort should be made to adhere to a predetermined protocol”), and
revert to the pre-planned primary analyses; and
2. Clearly and unambiguously explain that all but one health indicator (i.e. fatigue, physical function, overall health, pain, quality
of life, depression, and anxiety, but not sleep) demonstrated a non-significant outcome for pooled treatment effects at follow-up for
exercise therapy versus passive control; and
3. Include a rigorous assessment of how the potential for bias may have affected outcomes.
Introduction
After detailed scrutiny of the current version of the Cochrane review of exercise therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome (version 4, dated
7 February 2016) [1], I have noticed that the primary outcomes of the review have not been reported as per the pre-specified review
plan, but that unplanned (revised) primary analyses have been published in the place of the pre-specified analyses. (By ’unplanned’, I
refer to revisions to the methodology that were not pre-specified in the review’s protocol.) The switching of primary outcomes (from
pre-specified to unplanned analyses) is not mentioned in the main discussions, conclusion, or abstract, and is not explicitly explained
anywhere in the review. I had to carry out a detailed inspection of the review to understand exactly what had been changed.
At the very end of the full version of the review, a section titled “[d]ifferences between protocol and review” explains the deviations
from the protocol:
“[...] in the protocol it is stated, ”where results for continuous outcomes were presented using different scales or different versions of
the same scale, we used standardised mean differences (SMDs).“ We realise that the standardised mean difference (SMD) is much more
difficult to conceptualise and interpret than the normal mean difference (MD); therefore we decided to report both MDs and SMDs
in the Results section. In general, MDs are reported in the main Results section, whereas SMDs are supplied under the ”Sensitivity and
subgroup analysis“ subheading.”
Although the above quote isn’t explicit in referring to the primary outcomes, it explains the nature of, and rationale for, the unplanned
changes to the review’s primary outcomes. The only reason given for changing the pre-specified outcomes was that “the standardised
mean difference (SMD) is much more difficult to conceptualise and interpret than the normal mean difference”. No evidence is provided
to support this assertion, and it appears to be an assumption about the readers’ ability to interpret outcomes.
The outcomes of the review’s pre-specified primary analyses are outlined in the analysis section, but are only mentioned briefly (i.e.
only one or two sentences are used to explain each outcome), and the pre-specified outcomes are not discussed in the review’s main
discussions, abstract or conclusions. The pre-specified analyses have been relegated to the status of “sensitivity analyses”, and it is not
explicitly explained that these sensitivity analyses are the pre-specified primary analyses. It is easy for a reader to overlook these important
outcomes and to misunderstand their significance. I am concerned that most readers will be unaware of these changes to the primary
outcomes and of the significance of the changes to the protocol.
I consider the changes to have significantly altered the fundamental design, the main outcomes, and overall interpretation of the review.
Primary Outcomes
I would like to take this opportunity to explain the details of the changes to the primary outcomes to the reader, to the best of
my understanding. The review compares exercise therapy with a passive control (e.g. treatment as usual), which is the focus of this
submission. Outcomes for exercise therapy compared with other interventions (e.g. cognitive-behavioural therapy, supportive therapy,
and pacing) are also included in the review, but are not central to the concerns of this submission and will not be discussed further. The
126
Exercise therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome (Review)
Copyright © 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 review uses two primary outcome measures (fatigue and adverse outcomes) but adverse outcomes are not relevant to this submission.
A primary analysis at both end of treatment (12 to 26 weeks) and at follow-up (52 to 70 weeks) is carried out. This submission focuses
on primary analyses in relation to fatigue only, for exercise therapy versus passive control only.
The protocol defined two pre-specified primary analyses (one at end of treatment and one at follow-up) that were to determine the
pooled treatment effects of all eligible studies on fatigue. The two analyses were to determine a standardised mean difference (SMD)
for the pooled studies.
An unplanned decision was later made to relegate these pre-specified primary analyses to the status of sensitivity analyses and to replace
them with two unplanned analyses which assessed the same studies but by a different statistical method. The unplanned analyses (1.1
and 1.2) do not provide an overall (pooled) treatment effect but provide mean differences in a number of sub-analyses of studies grouped
together based on the specific tool or scoring method used to measure fatigue.
The two pre-specified primary analyses are published as sensitivity analysis 1.19 (fatigue at end of treatment) and another analysis (fatigue
at follow-up) which has not been designated a numerical identifier. To reiterate; these two analyses provide the pooled standardised
mean difference for fatigue for all eligible studies. Analysis 1.19 was included within the comprehensive set of tables published in the
review, however, the follow-up analysis (which demonstrated a non-significant outcome) was (uniquely for primary outcomes) omitted
from the set of tables (i.e. it was not published as a table) but was only briefly outlined under the subheadings: “Sensitivity analysis” >
“Investigating heterogeneity” (see appendix, below, for quote). As this analysis is not mentioned elsewhere in the review, and is only
mentioned in one sentence, it is easy to miss.
To clarify; the unplanned analyses assess the same studies as the pre-specified analyses, but only the pre-specified analyses indicate the
overall treatment effect for all eligible studies pooled together.
The outcomes of the two pre-specified analyses, using a pooled standardised mean difference (SMD) for all eligible studies, were that
exercise therapy (versus passive control) at end of treatment (i.e. analysis 1.19) had a significant positive treatment effect (SMD: -0.68;
95% CI -1.02 to -0.35), whereas at follow-up the treatment effect was not significant (SMD: -0.63; 95% CI -1.32 to 0.06).
The unplanned primary analysis 1.1 (fatigue at end of treatment) includes three separate sub-analyses which all demonstrate a positive
treatment effect, whereas unplanned analysis 1.2 (fatigue at follow-up) had mixed outcomes with two out of three sub-analyses
demonstrating a significant treatment effect.
So, to reiterate, the pre-specified primary analyses demonstrate that exercise therapy (versus passive control) had a significant pooled
treatment effect on fatigue at end of treatment, but no significant effect at follow-up. Whereas the unplanned (revised) analyses
demonstrate significant treatment effects at end of treatment but mixed outcomes at follow-up.
The fact that unplanned analysis 1.2 (fatigue at follow-up) did not consistently demonstrate significant treatment effects is not explained
with clarity in the main discussions of the review. For example, the outcomes are described as follows: “Moderate-quality evidence
showed exercise therapy was more effective at reducing fatigue compared to ‘passive’ treatment or no treatment.” (See the appendix,
below, for more quoted examples.)
The main discussions in the review also fail to inform the reader that the pooled treatment effect on fatigue (compared to a passive
control), for all eligible studies at follow-up, demonstrated a lack of significance, as per the pre-specified primary analysis.
All Outcomes at Follow-Up
Despite the limitations associated with self-report measures [2], physical function (a secondary outcome in the review) is widely
considered a useful measure for demonstrating severity of illness and functional changes in outcomes for chronic fatigue syndrome
[3,4,5]. It may be an especially helpful measure when assessing exercise therapy because exercise therapy is designed specifically to
address physical function or tolerance to exercise, or both [6]. It seems reasonable to expect physical function to improve after a course
of exercise therapy in chronic fatigue syndrome patients, if the therapy is clinically beneficial. The review reports that exercise therapy
(when compared to passive control) has a positive effect on self-report physical function at end of treatment (analysis 1.5), but this
effect is not sustained and there was no significant treatment effect at follow-up (see analysis 1.6).
There was also no significant effect on self-perceived overall health at follow-up (see analysis 1.15). Indeed, if we consider all of the
health-related pre-specified (primary and secondary) outcomes for the review, for exercise therapy versus passive control, then with the
exception only of sleep, all the indicators of health (i.e. fatigue, physical function, overall health, pain, quality of life, depression, and
anxiety), showed no significant treatment effects at follow-up. (The remaining measures were: serious adverse reactions to treatment;
drop-outs; and ’health resource use’ for which a pooled effect size was not provided but which demonstrated non-significant differences
between intervention arms in all but one of the sub-analyses.) This means that only sleep had a significant positive treatment outcome,
at follow-up, as per the pre-specified health indicators, for exercise therapy versus passive control.
Put simply, apart from sleep, all the pooled analyses demonstrate that there were no significant health benefits from exercise therapy at
follow-up.
These outcomes present a significantly different picture to the impression given by the review authors in their main discussions, abstract,
conclusions and summaries wherein, for example, outcomes in general, including fatigue, physical function and overall health, are

 described as being broadly positive (e.g. it is stated that “patients with CFS may generally benefit and feel less fatigued following exercise
therapy” and: “Exercise therapy had a positive effect on people’s daily physical functioning, sleep and self-ratings of overall health.”)
Furthermore, some specific erroneous information has been included in the main text to support the review authors’ interpretation;
i.e. the main discussion erroneously describes both physical function and self-rated overall health as indicating a positive treatment
effect at follow-up, when in fact the outcomes (i.e. analyses 1.6 and 1.15) were not significant. The reviewers erroneously assert that:
“A positive effect of exercise therapy was observed both at end of treatment and at follow-up with respect to [...] physical functioning
(Analysis 1.5; Analysis 1.6) and self-perceived changes in overall health (Analysis 1.14; Analysis 1.15).” (See appendix, below, for full
quote.)
The non-significant outcomes seen in all but one of the pre-specified health indicators at follow-up (exercise vs passive control) were
not discussed or explored in the discussions of the Cochrane review. I find this omission disappointing because the information would
help to inform patients and clinicians of the ongoing treatment effects that they might realistically expect from behavioural therapies
such as exercise therapy. I believe that the review would be more robust and helpful if it accurately highlighted and adequately explored
these issues in the main discussions.
The health outcomes at follow-up would currently be completely lost on a reader who did not scrutinise the individual analyses of the
review but relied upon the abstract or main discussions.
Bias Inherent in Open-Label Studies
Another issue that I believe is not explored with careful consideration is the possible implications relating to a review of purely open-
label studies; i.e. the possibility that any initial positive treatment effects broadly seen in this review at end of treatment, may entirely,
or to some degree, reflect biases inherent in trial methodologies that are unable to blind patients, therapists or trial investigators to
the treatment arm. The review itself explains that formal blinding “is not inherently possible in trials of exercise therapy” and that
this “increases risk of bias, as instructors’ and participants’ knowledge of group assignation might have influenced the true effect.” The
trend in this review towards non-significant effects, after treatment has ended, may lend strength to a concern that the initial self-
report treatment effects are transient and may be the result of various inherent methodological biases in open-label trials that use self-
report outcome measures [2,7,8]. Potential methodological biases in open-label trials using self-report outcomes may be, for example:
inadequate control conditions; self-reporting bias; therapist allegiance; and/or unplanned changes to trial methodology [7,9].
Readers might be interested to note that, for White 2011, which was the largest trial included in the review, the follow-up data used
in the review was at 52 weeks [10] but further follow-up data has also been published, at a median of 2.5 years after randomisation,
which demonstrated no significant differences between intervention arms for the primary outcomes [11].
Summary of Outcomes
In summary, the pre-specified primary analyses for fatigue were to assess the pooled standardised mean differences. However, the
reviewers then made a post-hoc decision to replace these analyses for which the only rationale provided was an assumption that a
standardised mean difference is supposedly “more difficult to conceptualise and interpret”. When all of the eligible studies are pooled,
as per the pre-specified plan, the pooled treatment effect at follow-up is not significant. However, the promotion of the unplanned
analyses has allowed the lack of a significant pooled treatment effect at follow-up to be overlooked and dismissed in the main analyses
and discussions, to the point where the main discussions could be interpreted to indicate that the treatment effects for fatigue were
entirely positive (see appendix, below, for quotes).
I question whether this is an appropriate level of clarity compared to what is expected from a Cochrane review. Cochrane reviews
have a reputation of providing transparent, uncomplicated, straightforward and reliable explanations of complex and rigorous analyses,
whereas this review has: used unplanned primary outcomes without a robust or evidence-based reason for switching outcomes; provided
just one sentence to explain the changes to the pre-specified primary outcomes; omitted a crucial sensitivity analysis from the tables
section; has not reflected the entire range of outcomes in the abstract, conclusions or main discussions; and has inaccurately described
outcomes at follow-up for physical function and overall health.
Justification for Switching Primary Outcomes
The reason given for switching the primary outcomes in the review is: “We realise that the standardised mean difference (SMD) is
much more difficult to conceptualise and interpret than the normal mean difference (MD) [...]”.
However, it is questionable whether the reason given for switching the primary outcomes justifies such an unplanned fundamental
change in the methodology of the review; no justification is given as to why the reviewers believe that readers would find it easier to
interpret the mean scores of a range of disparate fatigue questionnaires, in a series of sub-analyses, rather than a single standardised
mean difference for a pooled analysis of eligible studies. It is not clear to me why it is assumed that a variety of separate fatigue scales
should be easier to understand and interpret than a single standardised mean difference. As the changes to the protocol have had the
effect of changing the primary outcomes at follow-up, this means it would be desirable to provide a well-reasoned case to deviate from
the protocol and switch the primary outcomes.

 The claim with regards to interpretability raises the question of why standardised mean differences are adequate for other Cochrane
studies, but not this particular study. Cochrane has not adopted a policy of avoiding using standardised mean differences; instead the
Cochrane guidelines (section 12.6) encourage their use [12]. So this decision appears to be a novel post-hoc decision specific for this
study.
The Cochrane guidelines (section 12.6.1) actually suggest that ordinary mean differences can be difficult to interpret: “The units of
such outcomes [i.e. mean differences] may be difficult to interpret, particularly when they relate to rating scales.” [12] The guidelines
(section 12.6.1) acknowledge that there may be difficulties in interpreting standardised mean differences: “Without guidance, clinicians
and patients may have little idea how to interpret results presented as SMDs.” The guidelines do not favour one method over another
in general, but describe how each may be used for specific purposes; if one wishes to provide an overall treatment effect for studies that
use different measures to measure the same construct, then the standardised mean difference is a standard tool which is used widely in
Cochrane reviews and other research. The guidelines suggest that “[t]here are several possibilities for re-expressing [standardised means
differences] in more helpful ways”.
Implications Related to Changing Trial Protocols and Outcome Switching
The unplanned changes to the review make it vulnerable to potential bias or accusations of bias; conscious or unconscious personal or
professional preferences have the potential to affect post-hoc decisions with respect to methodology. Even if investigators are scrupulous
in the rigour of their decision making, unexpected biases have the potential to creep into unplanned decisions, which is an issue that
factors into the reasons why pre-trial plans (e.g. trial registers and protocols) have become widespread [7], and are used for Cochrane
reviews [12].
The Cochrane Guidebook for reviewers (Section: 2.1; “Rationale for protocols”) [12] explains: “Post hoc decisions made when the
impact on the results of the research is known, such as excluding selected studies from a systematic review, are highly susceptible to bias
and should be avoided.”
In the same paragraph, the guidelines also state: “While every effort should be made to adhere to a predetermined protocol, this is not
always possible or appropriate.”
However, it seems that, in this case, every effort was not made to adhere to the protocol because the unplanned changes seem to be
based on preference rather then necessity, and the pre-planned analyses have not been shown to be inferior, inadequate or inappropriate.
Conclusion
I find the changes to the protocol to be of particular concern for the following reasons:
1. The final primary analyses are unplanned and have replaced adequate, and arguably more helpful, pre-specified analyses;
2. The rationale provided for the changes was neither robust nor evidence-based but was based upon an assumption;
3. The changes have significantly altered the main outcomes and affected the interpretation of the review (i.e. changed one of the two
main outcomes from an insignificant treatment effect to an inconsistent but broadly positive effect); and
4. The pre-planned analysis for fatigue at follow-up, has been omitted from the tables section of the review which, as far as I understand,
is a unique omission for the primary outcomes.
For the sake of simplicity, rigour, and transparency, I ask the review team to reassess the review, including the decision to switch the
primary outcomes, and to:
1. Amend the review as per the guidelines in the Cochrane Guidebook quoted above (i.e. “every effort should be made to adhere to a
predetermined protocol”), and to revert to the pre-planned primary analyses; and
2. Clearly and unambiguously explain that all but one health indicator (i.e. fatigue, physical function, overall health, pain, quality
of life, depression, and anxiety, but not sleep) demonstrated a non-significant outcome for pooled treatment effects at follow-up for
exercise therapy versus passive control; and
3. Include a rigorous assessment of how the potential for bias may have affected outcomes of the open-label studies in this review, with
consideration of the use of self-report measures in open-label studies.

Relevant Quotes from the Review
Differences between protocol and review
“[...] in the protocol it is stated, ”where results for continuous outcomes were presented using different scales or different versions of
the same scale, we used standardised mean differences (SMDs).“ We realise that the standardised mean difference (SMD) is much more
difficult to conceptualise and interpret than the normal mean difference (MD); therefore we decided to report both MDs and SMDs
in the Results section. In general, MDs are reported in the main Results section, whereas SMDs are supplied under the ”Sensitivity and
subgroup analysis“ subheading.”

 Fatigue, End of Treatment
“At end of treatment, fatigue was measured and reported on different scales, and we performed a sensitivity analysis in which all available
studies were pooled using an SMD method. This strategy led to a pooled random-effects estimate of -0.68 (95% CI -1.02 to -0.35),
but the analysis suffered from considerable heterogeneity (I² = 78%, P value < 0.0001; Analysis 1.19). The observed heterogeneity was
caused mainly by the deviating results presented in Powell 2001. Exclusion of Powell 2001 gave rise to a pooled SMD of -0.46 (95%
CI -0.63 to -0.29) - an estimate that was not associated with heterogeneity (I² = 13%, P value 0.33).”
Fatigue, Follow-up
“At follow-up, the four available studies (Jason 2007; Powell 2001; Wearden 2010; White 2011) measured and reported fatigue on
different scales, and we performed a sensitivity analysis in which all available studies were pooled using an SMD method. The pooled
SMD estimate is -0.63 (95% CI -1.32 to 0.06), but heterogeneity was extensive (I² = 93%, P value < 0.00001).”
Quotes from main discussion sections of review re effectiveness of graded exercise (compared with passive control) on fatigue
Abstract > Authors’ conclusions
“Patients with CFS may generally benefit and feel less fatigued following exercise therapy, and no evidence suggests that exercise therapy
may worsen outcomes.”
Plain language summary > What does evidence from the review tell us?
“Moderate-quality evidence showed exercise therapy was more effective at reducing fatigue compared to ‘passive’ treatment or no
treatment.”
Discussion > Summary of main results
“When exercise therapy was compared with ’passive control,’ fatigue was significantly reduced at end of treatment (Analysis 1.1).”
Quotes selectively reporting secondary outcomes
Abstract > Authors’ conclusions
“A positive effect with respect to sleep, physical function and self-perceived general health has been observed, but no conclusions for
the outcomes of pain, quality of life, anxiety, depression, drop-out rate and health service resources were possible.”
Plain language summary > What does evidence from the review tell us?
“Exercise therapy had a positive effect on people’s daily physical functioning, sleep and self-ratings of overall health.”

“A positive effect of exercise therapy was observed both at end of treatment and at follow-up with respect to sleep (Analysis 1.12;
Analysis 1.13), physical functioning (Analysis 1.5; Analysis 1.6) and self-perceived changes in overall health (Analysis 1.14; Analysis
1.15).”

Dear Robert Courtney
Thank you for your ongoing and detailed scrutiny of our review. We have the greatest respect for your right to comment on and disagree
with our work, but in the spirit of openness, transparency and mutual respect we must politely agree to disagree.
Presenting health statistics in a way that makes sense to the reader is a challenge. Statistical illiteracy is - according to Girgerenzer and
co-workers - common in patients, journalists, and physicians (1). With this in mind we have presented the results as mean difference
(MD) related to the relevant measurement scales, for example Chalder Fatigue Scale, as well as standardised mean difference (SMD).
The use of MD enables the reader to transfer the results to the relevant measurement scale directly and judge the effect in relation to
the scale. We disagree that presenting MD and SMD rather than SMD and MD is an important change, and we disagree with the
claim that the analysis based on MD and SMD are inconsistent. This has been discussed as part of the peer-review process. Confidence
intervals are probably a better way to interpret data that P values when borderline results are found (2). Interpreting the confidence
intervals, we find it likely that exercise with its SMD on -0.63 (95% CI -1.32 to 0.06) is associated with a positive effect. Moreover,
one should also keep in mind that the confidence interval of the SMD analysis are inflated by the inclusion of two studies that we
recognize as outliers throughout our review. Absence of statistical significance does not directly imply that no difference exists.
All the included studies reported results after the intervention period and this is the main results. The results at different follow-up times
are presented in the text, but we have only included data available at the last search date, 9 may 2014. When the review is updated,
a new search will be conducted to find new, relevant follow up data and new studies. As a general comment, it is often challenging
to analyse follow-up data gathered after the formal end of a trial period. There is always a chance that participants may receive other
treatments following the end of the trial period, a behaviour that will lead to contamination of the original treatment arms and challenge
the analysis.
Cochrane reviews aim to report the review process in a transparent way, which enables the reader to agree or disagree with the choices
made. We do not agree that the presentation of the results should be changed. We note that you read this differently.

Summary
Comment: A query regarding the way outcomes for physical function and overall health have been described in the abstract,
conclusion and discussions of the review.
I would like to query the way that the outcomes for both physical function and overall health have been reported in the abstract,
conclusion and in the main discussion section of the current version (version 4) of the Cochrane review by Larun et al., dated 7 February
2016 [1].
The abstract, conclusion and main discussion section unambiguously indicate that there was a positive treatment effect on both physical
function and overall health, in relation to exercise therapy compared to a passive control.
For example, with respect to exercise therapy versus passive control, the “authors’ conclusions” in the abstract state without qualification
that: “A positive effect with respect to sleep, physical function and self-perceived general health has been observed[...]”. Another section
of the review (“What does evidence from the review tell us?”) asserts that: “Exercise therapy had a positive effect on people’s daily
physical functioning, sleep and self-ratings of overall health.” The “summary of main results” unequivocally states that: “A positive
effect of exercise therapy was observed both at end of treatment and at follow-up with respect to sleep (Analysis 1.12; Analysis 1.13),
physical functioning (Analysis 1.5; Analysis 1.6) and self-perceived changes in overall health (Analysis 1.14; Analysis 1.15).” (Please see
the appendix, below, to read these quotes in full.)
However, upon careful consideration of the relevant analyses, it seems that there were not consistent positive treatment effects for either
physical function or overall health in relation to exercise therapy versus passive control. Instead, for both of these variables, there was a
significant treatment effect only at end of treatment, but not at follow-up.
The relevant analyses are 1.5 (end of treatment) and 1.6 (follow-up) for self-report physical function, and 1.14 (end of treatment) and
1.15 (follow-up) for self-report overall health.
Analysis 1.5 assessed the pooled treatment effect on physical function at end of treatment for all eligible studies, and demonstrates
a significant effect. Analysis 1.6 used the same criteria but at follow-up, and demonstrates that there was not a significant effect for
physical function at follow-up.
Analysis 1.14 assessed the pooled treatment effect on overall health at end of treatment for all eligible studies, and demonstrates a
significant effect. Analysis 1.15 used the same criteria but at follow-up, and demonstrates that there was not a significant effect for
overall health at follow-up.
The lack of a significant treatment effect at follow-up is clearly illustrated by analyses 1.6 and 1.15.
These outcomes are also confirmed in the analysis section of the review where, in relation to the difference between exercise therapy
versus passive control, for physical function at follow-up, it is confirmed that: “[...] little or no difference cannot be ruled out.” And
for overall health at follow-up, it is confirmed that “the confidence interval implies inconclusive results”.
I believe that these outcome are not reflected accurately in the abstract, the main discussions or the conclusions of the review; specifically
the extracts that are quoted above and in the appendix below. For example, the “summary of main results” specifically claims that
positive treatment effects are demonstrated by analyses 1.6 and 1.15, but these analyses actually demonstrate an absence of significant
treatment effects. The discussion claims: “A positive effect of exercise therapy was observed [...] at follow-up with respect to [...] physical
functioning ([...]Analysis 1.6) and self-perceived changes in overall health ([...]Analysis 1.15).”
It is generally understood that a “positive” treatment effect equates to a significant effect, and I believe that the Cochrane text should
reflect this, or at least clarify that the term “positive effect” is being used to indicate a lack of significance.
It is likely that many readers will not read the full report or scrutinise each individual analysis but will read only the abstract, main
discussions or conclusions, so I believe it is important for the discussions to carefully and accurately reflect the outcomes of the analyses.
Cochrane has a reputation for upholding the highest standards including with respect to explaining outcomes in accurate and straight-
forward language. With this in mind, I request that the Cochrane review team kindly review the apparent disparities described above
and amend the text of the discussions and conclusions where appropriate, in order to reflect the lack of a significant treatment effect
for physical function and overall health at follow-up with respect to exercise therapy versus passive control.

All the included studies reported results after the intervention period and this is the main result. The results at different follow-up times

trials are included, and hence, we do not agree that it is wrong to give higher weight to these results in the abstract. Additionally, it is
often challenging to analyse follow-up data gathered after the formal end of a trial period. There is always a chance that participants

Summary
Comment: I’m concerned regarding your conclusion that no evidence suggests that exercise therapy may worsen outcome, as you have
stated that no conclusions were possible for the drop-out rate.
Whilst I appreciate that you are unable to draw conclusions about drop-out rates due to insufficient data, is it perhaps potentially
misleading or ambiguous to summarise that in general patients may benefit from GET with there being no evidence for symptoms
worsening, when there are a researchers that support the claim that CBT/GET is detrimental to the long term prognosis of patients
with ME/CFS. Without assessment of data concerning those whom have dropped out (those most likely to experience worsening
symptoms) the conclusions you have stated could prove harmful if taken as encouragement for GPs to place their patients on GET
regimes.
I do not question your analysis of the data, but rather I am concerned with the way in which you have expressed your findings.

Thank you for your interest in the review and your comment.
In our systematic review, we aim to summarise the effect estimates associated with the use of exercise therapy for patients diagnosed
with chronic fatigue syndrome CFS/ME. We decided to rely on data from randomised controlled trials (RCT), as RCTs provide much
more robust data than for example anecdotal evidence. We held serious adverse reactions (SAR) and serious adverse events (SAE) as
our primary outcome, whereas the drop-out rate was added as a secondary outcome.
Systematic reviews based on aggregated data dependent on the data reported in the included trials. One trial reported that SARs and
SAEs were rare in both groups, suggesting that the difference between the groups is small when measured in absolute terms. Analysis of
drop-out rates did not reveal statistical differences between the groups, and we cannot conclude that exercise is associated with higher
drop-out rates. Even if we had seen differences between the groups, however, drop-out rates must be interpreted with caution. It is
important to be aware that drop-out is not a direct measure of harm. There might be several reasons patients drop out, and some of
these reasons are not expected to distribute equally between the groups. Harm is one possible reason for drop-out, but patients may also
withdraw because they are unhappy with the randomisation (preconceptions), because they feel better or because they don’t experience
the expected level of improvement etc.
Systematic reviews aim to bring the best evidence to the clinical encounter, but shared decision making includes patient preferences
and clinical expertise when a treatment plan is decided upon.

Summary
It has been raised by others that the Cochrane review erroneously places ME/CFS in its mental health category. The response provided
by Cochrane when this issue was raised does not inspire confidence in their knowledge/advice on the disease. ME/CFS was the subject
of a comprehensive literature review carried out by the USA National Academy, published in 2015 this report categorically determined
that the disease ME/CFS is not a mental health disorder. The large volume of biomedical research findings of a wide range of organic
abnormalities is also at odds with a mental health disorder. Further more the World Health Organisation has categorised ME/CFS as
a neurological disease. The National Centre for Neuroimmune and Emerging Diseases has patented a blood test for the disease and is
in the early stages of validating it. It would be much appreciated if Cochrane would categorise ME/CFS in the appropriate group i.e.
along with other neurological diseases such as Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, multiple sclerosis etc. Delighted to see that the latest review
has been suspended and look forward to its replacement with a review that bases its findings on OBJECTIVE outcome data.

Many thanks for your comment and for noting recent categorisations of Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)/myalgic encephalomyelitis
(or encephalopathy) (ME). Feedback on reviews is normally dealt with by the relevant review author, but in this case as your query
relates more to an organisational management issue, we are responding on behalf of the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders (CMD)
Review Group and the Cochrane Editor in Chief.
We value your observations about the placement of CFS/ME reviews in The Cochrane Library. We want our evidence to properly
support those with lived experience of CFS/ME and to ensure that the CFS/ME community have confidence in our portfolio of reviews.
We are also aware that the hosting of this topic by the Cochrane CMD Review Group has been antagonistic to some in the CFS/ME
community.
Cochrane has recently created eight new Networks of Cochrane Review Groups (CRGs). The formation of these networks provides
a timely opportunity to review the scope of all CRGs and to consider changes where appropriate. In response to concerns raised by
members of the CFS/ME community, Cochrane has been considering repositioning the editorial oversight of CFS/ME reviews. The
Cochrane CMD Review Group currently sits within the Brain, Nerves and Mind (BNM) Network. In the future, reviews on this topic
might sit with another Cochrane Review Group within the BNM Network, or they might transfer to another Network altogether, such
134

 as the Long Term Conditions and Ageing 2 Network. Please be reassured that this is currently under consideration and a decision is
anticipated before the end of 2018.
We would also like to refer you to the recent published note for the latest information about the status of this particular review ‘This
review is subject to an ongoing process of review and revision following the submission of a formal complaint to the Editor in Chief.
Cochrane considers all feedback and complaints carefully, and revises or updates reviews when it is appropriate. The review author
team have advised us that a resubmission of this review is imminent. A decision on the status of this review will be made once this
resubmission has been through editorial process, which we anticipate will be towards the end of November 2018’.

Summary
A fewquestionsaboutwhere the disease ME/CFS will be placedbyCochrane inthe future. If Cochrane movesmyalgicencephalomyelitis/
chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) into the Long term conditions and Aging Network, will it be moved into the Metabolic and
Endocrine Disorders review group within this network? I’m making this assumption, based on the metabolic abnormalities, found in
people with ME/CFS, when objective metabolic exercise tests, are carried out, as per “Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test Methodology for
Assessing Exertion Intolerance in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome” - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/
30234078? If, in the alternative, Cochrane decides that ME/CFS is to remain in the Brain, Nerves and Mind (BNM) Network, will
it be moved into a separate group of its own? As whilst the disease fits within the BNM Network, it doesn’t fit into any of the listed
Cochrane Review Groups. The closest fit is probably the Multiple Sclerosis and rare diseases of the CNS? However, given that ME/
CFS is thought to be more prevalent that multiple sclerosis and is not rare, it doesn’t really fit into this group. Will a new Cochrane
Review Group, be made for ME/CFS, that is in line with the published biomedical and physiological findings?

Summary
Recently I have published a reanalysis of this Cochrane review. Unfortunately there are many problems with the review and the trials
in it. For example, P-Hacking, extensive endpoint changes, overlap in entry/recovery criteria, selecting patients who don’t have the
disease, ignoring null effects, relying on subjective outcomes in unblinded trials and ignoring the absence of objective improvement.
The reanalyses which looked at the objective outcomes showed that graded exercise therapy is not an effective treatment for ME/CFS.
The studies in the review do not provide any evidence that graded exercise therapy is safe, on the other hand, patient evidence and the
literature show that it is not safe.
The open access reanalysis can be read here: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2055102918805187

Changes made to the original review are stated below.
Objectives have been changed from ’(1) To systematically review all randomised controlled trials of exercise therapy for adults with
CFS, and (2) To investigate the relative effectiveness of exercise therapy alone or as part of a treatment plan’ in the 2004 version to
’The objective of this review was to determine the effects of exercise therapy (ET) for patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) as
compared with any other intervention or control’ in this update.
Comparisons have been changed from: ’(1) Exercise therapy versus treatment as usual or relaxation plus flexibility, (2) Exercise therapy
versus pharmacotherapy (fluoxetine), (3) Exercise therapy alone versus exercise therapy plus pharmacotherapy (fluoxetine) and (4)
Exercise therapy alone versus exercise therapy plus patient education’ in the 2004 version to the following in this update.
• ’“Passive control”: treatment as usual/waiting-list control/relaxation/flexibility.
◦ “Treatment as usual” comprises medical assessments and advice given on a naturalistic basis. “Relaxation” consists of
techniques that aim to increase muscle relaxation (e.g. autogenic training, listening to a relaxation tape). “Flexibility” includes
stretches performed according to selected exercises given.
• Psychological therapies: cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT)/cognitive treatment/supportive therapy/behavioural therapies/
psychodynamic therapies.
• Adaptive pacing therapy.
• Pharmacological therapy (e.g. antidepressants).’
We have revised and reordered the list of secondary outcomes for clarity and have added self-reported changes in overall health as a
new outcome, while moving adverse effects from a secondary outcome to a primary outcome.
We have updated the methods according to recommendations provided in the 2011 version of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Reviews of Interventions. For the first version of this review (2004), assessment of methodological quality was conducted according to
contemporary criteria of the handbook of The Cochrane Collaboration (Alderson 2004).The adequacy of allocation concealment was
rated as adequate (A), unclear (B) or inadequate (C) or as not used (D), and the CCDAN Quality Rating System (Moncrieff 2001)
was applied. For this update, we reextracted data on risk of bias to comply with current recommendations, and we used concealment
of allocation as the main quality criterion for included studies.
To explore possible differences between studies using different treatment strategies, control conditions and diagnostic criteria, we
decided to perform post hoc subgroup analyses when applicable. We also performed post hoc subgroup analyses excluding Powell 2001,
as the results reported in this trial seem to have introduced considerable heterogeneity into the analysis. Moreover, in the protocol it
is stated, “where results for continuous outcomes were presented using different scales or different versions of the same scale, we used
standardised mean differences (SMDs).” We realise that the standardised mean difference (SMD) is much more difficult to conceptualise
and interpret than the normal mean difference (MD); therefore we decided to report both MDs and SMDs in the Results section.
In general, MDs are reported in the main Results section, whereas SMDs are supplied under the “Sensitivity and subgroup analysis”
subheading.

 Planned methods not used in this review
Cluster trials
Studies often employ ’cluster randomisation’ (such as randomisation by clinician or practice), but analysis and pooling of clustered
data pose problems. First, study authors often fail to account for intraclass correlation in clustered studies, leading to a ’unit of analysis’
error (Bland 1997) whereby P values are spuriously low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance overestimated.
This causes type I errors (Bland 1997; Gulliford 1999).
No cluster RCTs were identified in this version of the review. Should such studies be identified in future updates, we will use the
following methodological approach. When clustering has not been accounted for in primary studies, we will present data in a table,
with a (*) symbol to indicate the presence of a probable unit of analysis error. We will seek to contact first authors of studies to obtain
intraclass correlation co-efficients for their clustered data and to adjust for this by using accepted methods (Gulliford 1999). When
clustering is incorporated, we will present the data as if from a parallel-group randomised study, but adjusted for the clustering effect.
We will additionally exclude such studies in a sensitivity analysis.
If cluster studies are appropriately analysed by taking into account intraclass correlation co-efficients and relevant data documented in
the report, synthesis with other studies will be possible using the generic inverse variance technique.
Cross-over trials
A major concern of cross-over trials is the potential for carry-over effect. This occurs when an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological,
psychological) of treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase. As a consequence of entry to the second phase,
participants can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out phase. For the same reason, cross-over trials are not
appropriate when the condition of interest is unstable (Elbourne 2002). As both effects are very likely in CFS/ME, randomised cross-
over studies were eligible but only when data up to the point of first cross-over were used. Data from the subsequent (second) period
of the cross-over trial were not considered for analysis.
Studies with multiple treatment groups
Multiple dose groups
Some studies may address the effects of different levels of supervision and follow-up with regards to the exercise intervention and the
comparator (e.g. sessions for designing exercise therapy, sessions for designing exercise therapy and planned telephone contacts, sessions
for designing exercise therapy and seven face-to-face treatment sessions, usual care). Should we identify trials that take this approach in
future updates, we will adopt the following approach. For dichotomous outcomes, we will sum up the sample sizes and the numbers
of people with events across all intervention groups. For continuous outcomes, means and standard deviations will be combined using
the methods described in Chapter 7 (Section 7.7.3.8) of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011).
Multiple medications
Some studies may combine several interventions with one comparison group. Should we identify trials of this nature in future updates,
we will analyse the effects of each intervention group versus placebo separately, but we will divide up the total number of participants
in the placebo group. In the case of continuous outcomes, the total number of participants in the placebo group again will be divided
up, but means and standard deviations will be left unchanged (see Chapter 16, Section 16.5.4, in Higgins 2011).
Methods intended for future reviews
If future updates identify a number of studies that enable reporting at different time points, this should be done for example at end of
treatment, at short-term follow-up (zero to six months), at medium-term follow-up (seven to 12 months) and at long-term follow-up
(over 12 months).
