Abstract
It is hypothesized that retrotransposons have played a fundamental role in primate evolution and
that enhanced neurologic retrotransposon activity in humans may underlie the origin of higher cogni-
tive function. As a potential consequence of this enhanced activity, it is likely that neurons are sus-
ceptible to deleterious retrotransposon pathways that can disrupt mitochondrial function. An example
is observed in the TOMM40 gene, encoding a b-barrel protein critical for mitochondrial preprotein
transport. Primate-specific Alu retrotransposons have repeatedly inserted into TOMM40 introns,
and at least one variant associated with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease originated from an Alu inser-
tion event. We provide evidence of enriched Alu content in mitochondrial genes and postulate that
Alus can disrupt mitochondrial populations in neurons, thereby setting the stage for progressive
neurologic dysfunction. This Alu neurodegeneration hypothesis is compatible with decades of
research and offers a plausible mechanism for the disruption of neuronal mitochondrial homeostasis,
ultimately cascading into neurodegenerative disease.

1. Introduction
The molecular mechanisms underlying sporadic neurode-
generative disorders such as late-onset Alzheimer’s disease
(LOAD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) remain unclear.
Although
traditional
genome-wide
association
studies
(GWASs) have identified numerous candidate genes associated
with both LOAD and PD, the explanatory power of these genes
is low (approximately 3%–4% per locus in LOAD cases), and
effective therapies that disrupt the progression of idiopathic
neurodegenerative diseases have yet to be developed [1–4].
Considering this disparity, a growing number of researchers
are hypothesizing a link between non-Mendelian mechanisms
and sporadic neurodegenerative disease.Functional hypotheses
for such mechanisms include epigenetic effects, novel struc-
tural variants influencing alternative gene splicing and gene
expression, maternal inheritance of mitochondrial DNA muta-
tions, and microbial infection [5–10]. A common thread across
decades of sporadic neurodegenerative disease research is the
hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to
neuron stress and neuron degeneration, ultimately leading to
the diseased state [11–19].

 Pathologies associated with age-related neurodegenerative
diseases (e.g., senile Ab plaques, tau aggregates, cerebral atro-
phy, and age-related cognitive impairment) are not restricted to
humans, having been identified in a number of nonhuman pri-
mates (e.g., chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, rhesus macaque,
tamarin, and gray mouse lemur) that collectively span at least
65 million years of primate evolution [20–24]. Of these
species, the one that is most distantly related to human, the
gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), routinely develops
age-related pathologies (within captive individuals in estab-
lished colonies) that are similar to both Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) and PD [25]. The evolutionary perspective that can be
gleaned from the spectrum of w65 million years of primate
evolution is critically important for understanding the origin
of neurodegenerative disease in humans.
Despite the fact that primates share similar age-related dis-
ease pathologies, the manifestation of devastating human-
specific symptoms associated with sporadic neurodegenerative
diseases across the global distribution of our species is sugges-
tive of a common neurologic mechanism that evolved in hu-
mans [23,24,26,27]. Following this logic, identification of the
genetic factors that contribute to sporadic neurodegenerative
disease in humans requires an understanding of the origin of
primates
and
the
genetic
mechanisms
underlying
the
evolution of enhanced neurologic function that separates
humans from our closest primate relatives. Therefore, central
to this perspective are the following observations: (1)
although primates share common age-related neurodegenera-
tive pathologies, humans display a spectrum of neurologic dis-
ordersthat areuniquely human; (2) a growingbody of evidence
supports the hypothesis that non-Mendelian mechanisms
contribute to the manifestation of neurodegenerative disease;
and (3) mitochondrialdysfunctionis consistently hypothesized
to be associated with sporadic neurodegenerative diseases such
as LOAD, PD, Huntington’s disease (HD), and amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (ALS).
Here we propose a hypothesis, informed by primate evo-
lution, for an age-related genetic mechanism that can
contribute to tissue-specific mitochondrial dysfunction
eventually resulting in neuronal death. It is important to
note that our hypothesis centers on molecular mechanisms
underlying cellular stress at the very initial stages of neuro-
logic disease, therefore preceding macroscopic pathologies
(e.g., pervasive plaque formation) that are frequently diag-
nostic of the disease state. We begin with the observation
that structural variants of primate-specific retrotransposons
(Alu elements) within the translocase of outer mitochon-
drial membrane 40 (TOMM40) gene are statistically associ-
ated with LOAD and that these transposable elements can
influence gene function through non-Mendelian pathways.
Retrotransposons are mobile elements that can replicate by
reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate and then
insert themselves into new locations across the genome
[28]. Broadly defined, retrotransposons include long termi-
nal repeats, long interspersed elements (LINEs), and short
interspersed elements (SINEs). Of these, Alu elements are a
highly successful primate-specific SINE and Alus are the
most abundant mobile elements in the human genome
having more than a million copies that comprise w11%
of genomic DNA.
Although traditionally viewed as “junk DNA,” a number
of discoveries have shown that retrotransposons have
played a fundamental role in primate evolution, including
the evolution of our own species, having contributed to
the formation of novel genes and gene transcription net-
works as well as having a role in human disease [29–35].
Moreover, retrotransposons (including Alu) remain active
in the human central nervous system throughout life, and
it is hypothesized that this activity underlies the origin of
higher brain function [32,33,36,37]. We postulate that
enhanced
somatic
retrotransposon
activity
in
human
neurologic networks is accompanied by tissue-specific
mitochondrial vulnerability that increases with time and/
or fluctuating epigenetic landscapes, and can thus be a
contributing mechanism to sporadic neurodegeneration.
This in turn leads to the specific hypothesis that retrotrans-
posons, operating through primate or human-specific path-
ways, are a plausible source for environment or age-induced
mitochondrial dysfunction that can ultimately contribute to
neuron atrophy and death.
2. Mitochondrial integrity and neurodegenerative
disease
The human brain has exceptionally high energetic demands,
and metabolically active neurons depend on healthy mitochon-
drial populations for their survival and function. Disrupting
mitochondrial homeostasis in neurons can have devastating
neurologic
consequences,
and
therefore
mitochondrial
dysfunction has long been hypothesized to be associated
with neurologic diseases (reviewed in [38] and [39]). First pro-
posed in 2004 by Swerdlow and Khan, the “mitochondrial
cascade hypothesis” provides the framework by which mito-
chondrial dysfunction can contribute to the development of
sporadic neurodegenerative disease [13]. Although not without
controversy, the hypothesis that dysfunctional mitochondria
play a role in LOAD, PD, and other neurodegenerative condi-
tions is a consistent theme across decades of research. The
mitochondrial genome encodes only 13 proteins, yet mito-
chondria depend on an estimated 1500 nuclear-encoded pro-
teins for their functionality. Thus, genetic mechanisms that
contribute to genomic instability of the nuclear genome,
including deleterious retrotransposon-mediated pathways,
can directly impact mitochondrial function and contribute to
neurologic disease. A clear example involves the relationship
between genetic variation of the TOMM40 gene and neurode-
generative diseases including LOAD, PD, HD, and ALS [40].
2.1. Insights from TOMM40
The translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex is
responsible for importing more than 90% of all preproteins
P.A. Larsen et al. / Alzheimer’
s & Dementia 13 (2017) 828-838
829
 into the mitochondrion, and the TOM complex comprises
seven subunits (Tom5, Tom6, Tom7, Tom20, Tom22,
Tom40, and Tom70). Of these, Tom40 forms a b-barrel protein
that is the primary channel through which mitochondrial pre-
proteins pass, and the fully assembled TOM complex contains
three Tom40 b-barrel channels arranged in a triangular pattern
[41]. The TOMM40 gene is located on human chromosome 19
and encodes 10 exons and nine introns (Fig. 1). A poorly un-
derstood yet functional and potentially important paralog of
TOMM40, TOMM40L, is located on chromosome 1. Both
single-nucleotide polymorphisms and short structural variants
within TOMM40 have been implicated in a number of neuro-
logic disorders, ranging from mild cognitive impairment to
major neurodegenerative diseases including LOAD and PD
(reviewed in [40]) [42–44]. Amyloid precursor protein
accumulates at Tom40 in AD brains, clogging the TOM
complex and contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction [16].
Moreover, with respect to PD, decreasing Tom40 expression
results in increasing a-synuclein accumulation and is directly
correlated with an increase in reactive oxygen species, inflam-
mation, oxidative damage, reduced adenosine triphosphate
production, and an overall decrease in mitochondrial integrity
[45]. Disrupting the TOM complex effectively triggers mito-
chondrial stress response and can ultimately lead to mitoph-
agy, a process that has especially devastating consequences
across neurologic networks [38,46,47].
Despite numerous lines of evidence that show that the
TOM complex plays an essential role in mitochondrial sta-
bility, there remains an ongoing debate regarding the signif-
icance of TOMM40 sequence variation with respect to
mitochondrial dysfunction and potential consequences for
neurologic disease. Much of this debate centers on the obser-
vation that TOMM40 is in tight linkage disequilibrium with
the APOE gene, and thus, questions have been posed as to
whether there is an APOE-independent effect of variation
within TOMM40 and AD risk (reviewed in [40,48]). In
particular, the statistical association between variable
deoxythymidine homopolymer repeats within TOMM40
intron 6 (the rs10524523 poly-T; i.e., rs523) and LOAD
risk and time of onset has gained much attention. Three cat-
egorical length classes of rs523 are identified, short
(S; �18 bp), long (L; 19–29 bp), and very long (VL;
�30 bp) based on distributions of rs523 lengths in individ-
uals of Caucasian ancestry [49]. The distribution of categor-
ical length classes observed in Caucasians was also observed
in individuals of African, African American, and Asian
ancestry. Cis-haplotypes of APOE and rs523 are clearly
delineated and are specific to ethnicity. For example, in Cau-
casians, the APOE ε4 allele is usually linked to an rs523L
allele, whereas in West Africans, the APOE ε4 allele can
be linked to either an rs523L allele or an rs523 S allele. Af-
rican American APOE-rs523 haplotype frequencies differ
from both West Africans and Caucasians and represent
admixture of distinct West African and Caucasian haplo-
types [50]. Several studies have reported on statistically sig-
nificant associations of rs523 genotype and APOE-rs523
haplotypes with the risk and age of onset of AD and with
cognitive decline [40,48,49,51–55]. Other meta-analyses
of GWAS data have not identified a statistically significant
association of rs523 with the risk or age of onset of AD in-
dependent of APOE genotype [56,57].
A key observation regarding the origin of rs523 that has
been largely overlooked, is that rs523 is part of an Alu mobile
element monomer that has inserted into TOMM40 intron 6 in
the antisense orientation (Fig. 1). To date, only a single study
has noted the relationship between rs523 and Alu elements
that are enriched in TOMM40 intron 6 [58]. Indeed, Payton
et al. [58] provide critical insight with respect to TOMM40
gene expression and the presence of Alus within TOMM40 in-
trons. We expand on this observation and highlight how Alu
retrotransposons in TOMM40 introns 6 and 9 could contribute
to transcriptional noise through enhanced nonsense-mediated
Fig. 1. Diagram of human TOMM40 showing location of rs523 structural variant (A) and Alu elements (B). The primary region of genomic instability is iden-
tified as the approximate region spanning bases 44,898,490 to 44,903,725 on chromosome 19 (human genome build GRCh38/hg38). This region is hypothesized
to be vulnerable to Alu-related mechanisms that contribute to genomic instability including alternative splicing and modification of pre-mRNA transcripts.

 decay and/or the production of alternative TOMM40 iso-
forms.
2.2. Alu elements and TOMM40 stability
Retrotransposons, including Alu elements, can have a pro-
found influence on messenger RNA (mRNA) stability and
gene transcription networks [31]. Sixteen Alu elements have
inserted themselves across TOMM40 introns 6 and 9, and
the rs523 poly-T is part of an Alu element in antisense orien-
tation. The 30 end of TOMM40 is particularly rich with Alu el-
ements and, over evolutionary time, these have inserted
themselves into the germline in both sense and antisense ori-
entations (Fig. 1B). The relative age of each Alu element and
the orientation of Alu insertion events play an essential role
with respect to potential Alu exonization and deleterious
recombination events that can disrupt TOMM40 mRNA tran-
scripts (Fig. 2) [29,31,58]. With respect to rs523, both poly-T
and poly-A rich regions associated with intronic Alu elements
can interrupt efficient processing of pre-mRNA transcripts by
spliceosome machinery through the activation of premature
polyadenylation
sites
and/or
antagonistic
binding
of
AU-rich binding proteins such as hnRNP C, PABP, PTB,
and U2AF65 [6,31,59]. Alu-associated poly-T regions result-
ing from antisense insertion events are known to destabilize
gene transcription and contribute to increasing levels of
mRNA degradation [60].
Collectively, these observations identify a region of
enhanced genomic instability in TOMM40 that is vulnerable
to several Alu-associated pathways proven to alter gene
Fig. 2. Select mechanisms by which retrotransposon can influence gene splicing in somatic tissues (also see [31]). (A) de novo Alu retrotransposition events; (B)
formation of inverted-repeat Alu duplexes within pre-mRNA transcripts. Such Alu duplexes are the primary target for tissue-specific A-to-I RNA editing path-
ways that can destabilize pre-mRNA transcripts [31]. (C) Hypomethylation of Alu contributing to exonization (blue dots represent both DNA and histone
methylation landscapes).

831
 expression and implicated in a growing list of human dis-
eases (Fig. 2) [31]. Inverted repeat Alus, such as those
distributed across TOMM40 introns 6 and 9, can disrupt
mRNA stability by facilitating premature transcription
termination
and
altering
adenosine-to-inosine
(A-to-I)
RNA editing. These pathways can also contribute to the pro-
duction of altered protein conformations [31], and alterna-
tive
TOMM40
isoforms
with
premature
termination
coinciding with Alus (i.e., Tom40ʹ) are identified in National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and Human
Protein Atlas databases. If Alu elements enriched across
the 30 end of TOMM40 are contributing to the production
of
modified
yet
functional
transcripts
that
escape
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, then it is likely that pep-
tides encoded by these transcripts would still be localized
to the TOM complex [61]. Predictive modeling [62] of one
potential alternative splicing event that coincides with Alus
in TOMM40 intron 9 (Tom40ʹ; NCBI XP_005258468) sug-
gests that a b-barrel protein conformation may still form.
If so, Tom40ʹ would likely display functional differences
from normal Tom40, perhaps serving to restrict the passage
of preproteins and/or destabilize the TOM complex (Fig. 3)
[61]. Moreover, an intriguing possibility with respect to the
paralog TOMM40L is that Alu-associated disruption of
normal mRNA processing of Tom40 could result in
increased localization of Tom40L to the mitochondrial outer
membrane. This conformation could alter the efficient pro-
cessing of mitochondrial preproteins or otherwise destabi-
lize the TOM complex. If accurate, such a mechanism
could result in the propagation of inefficient TOM channels
through mitochondrial biogenesis, fusion, and fission within
individual neurons over variable time-scales (Fig. 4).
2.3. Retrotransposons, mitochondrial gene vulnerability,
and neurodegenerative disease
From a broader perspective, Alu exonization and somatic
retrotransposition events of both LINEs and Alu have been
identified in multiple TOM genes including TOMM5,
TOMM7, TOMM22, TOMM40, and TOMM40L [36,63,64].
These patterns indicate TOM genes are actively influenced
by and are vulnerable to retrotransposons, perhaps owing to
their high transcription rates and open chromatin status as
hypothesized by de Andrade et al. [63]. If true, it can be pre-
dicted that nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes would
display an enrichment of mobile elements with respect to
other nuclear genes. To test this prediction, we examined
the mobile element content of 1145 genes that encode mito-
chondrial proteins [65] and an additional 8973 randomly
selected protein-coding genes throughout the human genome
(Supplementary Material). Our results provide statistical sup-
port for an enrichment of Alu mobile elements within and
adjacent to mitochondrial genes (Fig. 5; Supplementary
Material), consistent with previous analyses identifying en-
riched Alu content at transcriptionally active regions of the
genome [66]. Thus, transcriptionally active genes essential
for mitochondrial function are potentially more vulnerable

were generated using normal (A) TOMM40 (NCBI NP_006105; 361 amino acid sequences in length) and truncated (B) TOMM40 (NCBI XP_005258468;
335 aa) alternative gene transcripts. The 30 end of the truncated 335 aa transcript coincides with the AluY mobile element within intron 9 of TOMM40 (a potential
region of enhanced A-to-I editing; Figs. 1 and 2). Regions shaded in blue identify major conformational changes to the b-barrel protein.

 to deleterious retrotransposon-related mechanisms known to
disrupt gene expression pathways (reviewed in [31,35,67]).
If operating within energetically demanding neurons,
retrotransposon-related destabilization of efficient transcrip-
tion and translation of mitochondrial genes would likely
contribute to the activation of inflammatory response path-
ways that can cascade to neuronal tissue damage and neurode-
generative disease [47]. It would therefore be anticipated that
deleterious retrotransposon activity in nuclear-encoded mito-
chondrial genes that encode peptides occupying key functional
roles would contribute to a variety of neurologic diseases. In
addition to the connections observed between TOMM40 Alu-
rs523
and
LOAD
[40,58],
there
are
several
striking
examples that support this observation. A notable example
is found with adrenoleukodystrophy, where multiple Alu
insertion events within the ABCD1 gene (a nuclear-encoded
mitochondrial gene) contribute to deleterious nonhomologous
recombination events, disrupting functional ABCD1 peptides
[68]. ABCD1 encodes a protein of the adenosine triphos-
phate–binding cassette transporter family, the disruption of
which contributes to functional and structural destabilization
of mitochondria and is hypothesized to result in the accumula-
tion of very long chain fatty acids throughout the nervous sys-
tem [68,69]. Adrenoleukodystrophy patients suffer from
progressive axonal degeneration contributing to a range of
neurologic impairments, including progressive memory loss.
Another example involves the OPA1 gene where an
antisense Alu insertion event is hypothesized to contribute to
alternative OPA1 splicing events [70]. OPA1 peptides play a
key role in mitochondrial fusion and mitochondrial cristae
morphology, and the Alu-disruption of OPA1 expression is
linked to autosomal dominant optic atrophy, a disease
stemming from progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion
cells ultimately resulting in optic nerve atrophy [70,71].
Alu exonization, Alu-mediated copy number variants, and
Alu-mediated nonhomologous end joining have also been
detected in mitochondrial genes (including mitochondria
quality control genes) associated with Leigh syndrome,
pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, presenile dementia,
and PD (e.g., NDUFS2, SLC30A6, PDHA1, and PARK2)
[34,64,72,73]. Collectively, these examples demonstrate

mations of Tom40, ultimately resulting in increasing levels of inflamma-
tion, neuron toxicity, and neuron death resulting in neurodegenerative
disease. The model is applicable to any number of nuclear-encoded mito-
chondrial proteins critical to mitochondrial stability within neurons and is
consistent with the broader “mitochondrial cascade hypothesis” [13].
Transcriptional noise and alternative splicing events associated with
increased retrotransposon activity in neurons can contribute to mitochon-
drial stress over time, ultimately resulting in increasing mitochondrial
stress (Y-axis) and progressive neurodegenerative disease resulting in
neuron atrophy and death (X-axis).

 that primate-specific Alu mobile elements can disrupt the
translation and peptide formation of nuclear-encoded mito-
chondrial genes, potentially contributing to the manifesta-
tion of multiple neurodegenerative disorders.
3. Mechanisms for altered gene expression and
neurologic disease: an epigenetic connection
Alu elements are believed to have played a critical role in
primate evolution, especially in our own species wherein
increased Alu insertion events, human-specific SINE-Variable
Number of Tandem repeat-Alus, human-specific Alu-derived
exons, and enhanced neurologic Alu activity separate us
from
nonhuman
primates
[36,64,72,74].
Indeed,
an
accumulating amount of evidence indicates retrotransposons
(including both LINEs and SINEs) are actively influencing
human neural stem cells and somatic tissues of the brain,
resulting in human-specific neurologic transcription networks
[31–33,36,37,75,76]. Advanced genomic approaches, such as
single-cell genome sequencing, further support this fasci-
nating possibility and reveal that somatic retrotransposition
activity in the brain contributes to the establishment of mosaic
genomes
of
individual
neurons
[37,75–78].
Although
potentially advantageous for higher-order cognition, this
enhanced retrotransposon activity in the human central ner-
vous system is likely accompanied by vulnerability in somatic
tissue that increases with age [76].
Host genomes have evolved a number of mechanisms to
defend against deleterious retrotransposon activity, including
DNA and histone methylation and RNA degradation using
microRNA-processing enzymes (reviewed in [31]). The epige-
netic silencing of Alu elements is mediated by both DNA and
histone H3K9 methylation to suppress transcription and retro-
transposition [79,80]. Hypomethylation of Alu elements
contributes to enhanced retrotransposon activity, which in
turn can increase transcriptional noise by disrupting gene
expression pathways, inducing alternative splicing events,
and reducing mRNA stability [79]. Genome-wide Alu hypo-
methylation is part of the aging process and global hypomethy-
lation of Alu is statistically associated with AD [81,82]. More
broadly, emerging neuroepigenetic research is establishing a
link between age and environment-associated epigenetic mod-
ifications and a range of neurologic disorders, from autism and
schizophrenia to LOAD and PD [83]. A growing body of ev-
idence suggests that increased retrotransposon activity in the
human central nervous system, mediated by epigenetic regula-
tion for beneficial neurologic function and the reduction of
deleterious events, is accompanied by enhanced vulnerability
in neurons resulting in neurologic disease [31,35,37,76].
With respect to heightened neuronal retrotransposon activ-
ity, the potential impact on neuron mitochondrial function re-
mains unexplored. Hypomethylation of Alu elements and/or
de novo Alu insertions within, or near, genes that are essential
to mitochondrial function could contribute to mRNA insta-
bility, ultimately leading to mitochondrial dysfunction.
Furthermore, an intriguing observation with respect to histone
H3K9 methylation of Alu elements is that H3K9 also regu-
lates APOE transcription [80]. Additional research is required
to determine how the epigenetic interplay between the Alu-
rich regions within and flanking TOMM40 (Fig. 1; immedi-
ately upstream of APOE on human chromosome 19) and
APOE can influence either TOMM40 or APOE gene expres-
sion, or both. Operating within an epigenetic framework,
Alu-related transcriptional noise of nuclear-encoded mito-
chondrial genes would potentially correlate with senescence
and environmental exposures [84]. Tissue-specific methyl-
ation patterns of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes are
observed in mammals and indicate specialized epigenetic
modulation for the maintenance of tissue-dependent mito-
chondrial functional pathways, including specialized path-
ways in the brain [85]. Collectively, these data provide a
putative epigenetic link between time-dependent mitochon-
drial dysfunction (both slowly accumulating or accelerated)
and tissue-specific idiopathic neurodegenerative disease.
Regarding the coevolution of mitochondrial organelles
and eukaryotes, the origin of primate-specific retrotranspo-
sons is a notably recent event. This is especially interesting
when considering the enhanced neurologic retrotransposon
activity
that
separates
humans
from
other
primates
[33,36,76]. In concert with the increased longevity of
modern humans, human-specific age-related neurologic dis-
eases are perhaps indicative of increasing neurologic tran-
scriptional noise because of a relaxation of retrotransposon
control mechanisms. It is within this framework that we pro-
pose the Alu neurodegeneration hypothesis.
4. The Alu neurodegeneration hypothesis
Of all tissues in the human body, the brain has one of the
highest rates of transposable element activity [32,36,75].
This phenomenon is one of the most striking characteristics
that separates human neurologic gene networks from our
closest primate relatives, leading Friedli and Trono (2015)
to conclude that “.the endovirome [the collection of all
transposable elements within the genome] and its controllers
played a fundamental role in the expansion of higher brain
functions that was key to the emergence of modern
humans.” Managing this enhanced retrotransposon activity
requires exquisite control of the molecular pathways that
work together to reap the evolutionary benefits of novel
gene function while simultaneously preventing catastrophic
events [31,32,76]. When considering the Friedli and Trono
(2015) hypothesis, it is conceivable that gain-of-function asso-
ciated with enhanced transposable element activity and the
evolution of higher cognitive ability of modern Homo sapiens
may be accompanied by neurologic vulnerability. In light of
recent discoveries regarding the epigenetic regulation of trans-
posable elements, such neurologic vulnerability may well
correlate with age. Thus, humans, with our steadily increasing
life expectancy rates, would be especially vulnerable [86].
We hypothesize that retrotransposons, operating through
human-specific
neurologic
pathways
[32,33,74,87–89],
P.A. Larsen et al. / Alzheimer’
s & Dementia 13 (2017) 828-838
834
 contribute to environment and/or age-related neurodegenera-
tion by disrupting functional mitochondrial populations within
neurons. This mitochondrial disruption can occur through
several retrotransposon-inducedmechanismsthatcaninfluence
the efficient and accurate transcription and/or translation of
mitochondrial genes encoded in the nucleargenome, ultimately
resulting in depauperate neuron mitochondrial populations.
Considering TOMM40, it is plausible that Alu-related confor-
mational changes (both subtle and major) of the outer and inner
mitochondrial membrane pores could restrict or prevent the
normal translocation of proteins, ultimately contributing to
mitochondrial stress, inflammation, and mitophagy (Figs. 1–4).
Importantly, the disruption of mitochondrial protein trafficking
across both TOMM and translocase of inner mitochondrial
membrane
complexes
has
been
implicated
in
several
neurodegenerative diseases (AD, PD, HD, and ALS) [47]. An
age-related and/or environmental-related pathway for such
disruption is found in the epigenetic regulation of retrotranspo-
sons
in
the
central
nervous
system.
Both
tissue
and
cell-specific hypomethylation of Alu elements, resulting from
fluctuating
epigenetic
landscapes,
can
facilitate
retrotransposon-induced mitochondrial stress.
The mechanisms by which symbiotic mitochondrial organ-
elles coevolved with eukaryotic genomes provide a potential
vulnerability with respect to recently evolved primate and or
human-specific genetic mechanisms that disrupt genestability.
This vulnerability can be amplified through mitochondrial
biogenesis and downstream mitochondrial fission and fusion
events, thus contributing to the initial establishment of ineffi-
cient mitochondria that increase mitochondrial stress over
time and limit neuron functionality, ultimately leading to a
diseased state (Fig. 4) [13,15,18,19]. Under this framework,
it would be expected that retrotransposon-mediated dysfunc-
tional mitochondrial events would manifest in different neuro-
logic tissues and in a seemingly temporally sporadic nature
that is difficult to predict using traditional approaches such
as
GWAS.
In
light
of
emerging
data
regarding
retrotransposon-induced mosaic genomes of individual neu-
rons, it is likely that only advanced single-cell genomic tech-
niques will provide the appropriate resolution for detecting
retrotransposon-related mitochondrial dysfunction, as such
events may be restricted to specific neuron populations arising
from individual progenitor cells influenced by somatic retro-
transposition during brain development [36,37,76,78].
The initiation of tissue-specific retrotransposon-induced
dysfunctional
mitochondrial
cascade
events,
operating
through variable intercellular and intracellular processes and
occurring at different life stages, would ultimately result in
diseased states that share similar underlying pathologies,
such as inflammatory response activation, protein aggregation,
and neurodegeneration [47,90,91], although with a spectrum
of
phenotypic
neurologic
impairments.
Future
studies
focused on the epigenetic regulation of retrotransposons in
individual neurons and across neurologic networks may
elucidate the origin of a range of neurologic disorders and
serve as the foundation for novel therapeutic approaches. We
recommend that the “Alu-neurodegeneration hypothesis” be
considered for sporadic tissue-specific neurodegenerative dis-
eases wherein mitochondrial dysfunction has been identified,
including AD, PD, HD, and ALS.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT
1. Systematic review: Despite enormous research effort
the molecular mechanisms underlying sporadic
neurodegenerative disease remain elusive. Moreover,
although mitochondrial dysfunction is hypothesized
to be an early indicator of multiple neurodegenera-
tive diseases, the source of this dysfunction also re-
mains
unclear. We postulate that
neurological
mitochondrial populations are vulnerable to delete-
rious retrotransposon activity operating on nuclear-
encoded mitochondrial genes.
2. Interpretation: Primate-specific Alu elements are en-
riched within nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes,
and these genes are subject to Alu-mediated mecha-
nisms that contribute to transcriptional noise. It is
likely that Alu-induced transcriptional noise of mito-
chondrial genes correlates with fluctuating epige-
netic
landscapes
associated
with
aging
and/or
environmental stress.
3. Future directions: Our hypothesis can account for
incipient mitochondrial dysfunction observed in spo-
radic neurodegenerative disease. We recommend
future studies focused on the interplay between retro-
transposons
and
nuclear-encoded
mitochondrial
gene
expression
and
protein
formation.
Such
research may provide new therapeutic approaches
that could alleviate the earliest stages of mitochon-
drial
and
cellular
stress
within
neurological
networks,
thereby
preventing
neurodegenerative
cascades.
