AIMS
Proprietary Chinese medicines (pCMs) and health products, generally believed to be natural and safe, are gaining popularity
worldwide. However, the safety of pCMs and health products has been severely compromised by the practice of adulteration. The
current study aimed to examine the problem of adulteration of pCMs and health products in Hong Kong.
METHODS
The present study was conducted in a tertiary referral clinical toxicology laboratory in Hong Kong. All cases involving the use of
pCMs or health products, which were subsequently confirmed to contain undeclared adulterants, from 2005 to 2015 were
reviewed retrospectively.
RESULTS
A total of 404 cases involving the use of 487 adulterated pCMs or health products with a total of 1234 adulterants were identified.
The adulterants consisted of approved drugs, banned drugs, drug analogues and animal thyroid tissue. The six most common
categories of adulterants detected were nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (17.7%), anorectics (15.3%), corticosteroids
(13.8%), diuretics and laxatives (11.4%), oral antidiabetic agents (10.0%) and erectile dysfunction drugs (6.0%). Sibutramine
was the most common adulterant (n = 155). The reported sources of these illicit products included over-the-counter drug stores,
the internet and Chinese medicine practitioners. A significant proportion of patients (65.1%) had adverse effects attributable to
these illicit products, including 14 severe and two fatal cases. Psychosis, iatrogenic Cushing syndrome and hypoglycaemia were
the three most frequently encountered adverse effects.
CONCLUSIONS
Adulteration of pCMs and health products with undeclared drugs poses severe health hazards. Public education and effective
regulatory measures are essential to address the problem.

 WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT
• Proprietary Chinese medicines (pCMs) and health products, generally believed to be natural and safe, are gaining
popularity worldwide.
• Adulteration of pCMs and health products with undeclared drugs has been reported previously but this was limited
mainly to routine surveillance data or case reports/series with a small number of affected patients.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
• A wide variety of adulterants, including approved drugs, banned drugs, drug analogues and animal thyroid tissue, were
identified.
• Adverse effects were seen in a significant proportion of patients, including severe and even fatal cases.
Introduction
Traditional Chinese medicine is widely used all over the
world as a form of complementary medicine for various
indications and for improving general health, especially in
Chinese communities. A survey in Hong Kong in 2014
showed
that
18%
of residents
who had had
medical
consultations in the previous 30 days had consulted a
Chinese medicine practitioner [1]. Another survey in 1994
revealed that 45% of Singaporeans had consulted a Chinese
medicine practitioner at some time, and that 19% had
consulted one in the previous year [2]. The use of proprietary
Chinese medicines (pCMs), which are composed solely of
Chinese medicines and formulated in a finished dose form,
is particularly popular because of their convenience and
ready accessibility. There is also an ever-growing market
worldwide for a variety of health products, which contain
herbal or other natural ingredients with claimed nutritional,
physiological or health-promoting effects.
The increasing popularity of these pCMs and health
products may be attributed to the general belief that these
products are ‘natural and safe’. However, this assumption
may not always hold true. Adulteration of pCMs and health
products with undeclared agents, including prescription
drugs, drug analogues and banned drugs, has been reported
[3–5]. Potentially fatal adverse effects could result from the
use of these illicit products. As the only tertiary referral
clinical toxicology laboratory in Hong Kong, our centre has
encountered numerous poisoning cases related to the use of
adulterated pCMs or health products throughout the years.
To examine the problem, we retrospectively reviewed cases
involving use of pCMs or health products adulterated with
undeclared drugs referred to the centre from 2005 to 2015.
Methods
From January 2005 to December 2015, all cases referred to
the Hospital Authority Toxicology Reference Laboratory
involving use of pCMs or health products, which were
subsequently confirmed to contain undeclared adulterants,
were reviewed retrospectively. Clinical data were collected
by reviewing the laboratory database as well as the patients’
medical records. Demographic data, clinical presentation,
medical history, drug history, laboratory findings and the
analytical findings of the pCMs and health products were
studied.
The
causal
relationship
between
the
clinical
features, if any, and the adulterants detected was evaluated
based on the known adverse effects of the adulterants, the
temporal sequence, as well as the presence of any other
underlying diseases. If poisoning was ascertained, the sever-
ity was graded according to an established poisoning severity
score [6].
Qualitative
general
toxicology
screen
using
high-
performance liquid chromatography with a diode array
detector was performed on the pCM and health product
specimens. Confirmatory analysis employing gas chromatog-
raphy mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography tandem
mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) was performed as indicated.
Detection of animal thyroid tissue was carried out by
LC–MS/MS after protein digestion.
The study was approved by the Hong Kong Hospital
Authority Kowloon West Cluster Research Ethics Committee
[approval number KW/EX-16-116(101–06)]. The Committee
exempted the study group from obtaining patient consent
because the presented data were anonymous and the risk of
identification was low.

Results
A total of 404 cases, involving the use of 487 adulterated
pCMs or health products, were identified in the authors’
laboratory during the study period. The patients were referred
from 22 different local hospitals. There were 236 (58%)
females and 168 (42%) males. The age of the patients
ranged from 1 month to 90 years, and the median age
was
51
years.

involving subgroup analysis of weight-reducing agents,
herbal
antidiabetic
products,
corticosteroid-adulterated
pCMs and sexual enhancement products, have been previ-
ously published [8–12].
Among the 487 adulterated products, pCMs and health
products constituted 61% (n = 299) and 39% (n = 188),
respectively. Brand names and/or packages were available in
60% (n = 291) of the adulterated products. In total, 1234

 adulterants were detected in the illicit products, with an
average of 2.5 adulterants per product. In the most extreme
case,
up
to
17
adulterants
[comprising
corticosteroid,
multiple nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and
other drugs] were detected in a single product indicated for pain.
The adulterants consisted of approved drugs, banned drugs,
drug analogues and animal thyroid tissue. The six most
common categories of adulterants detected were NSAIDs
(17.7%), anorectics (15.3%), corticosteroids (13.8%), diuretics
and laxatives (11.4%), oral antidiabetic agents (10.0%) and
erectile dysfunction drugs (6.0%). Details of the various
categories of adulterants are shown in Figure 2. The top 21

 frequently encountered adulterants are listed in Table 1.
Sibutramine, an anorectic, was the most common adulterant
and was present in 31.8% (n = 155) of the illicit products. It was
followed by phenolphthalein, a banned laxative commonly
adulterated together with sibutramine, which was detected in
18.1% (n = 88) of the adulterated products. Glibenclamide
(12.5%), diclofenac (12.3%), prednisone acetate (11.5%),
sildenafil
(11.1%),
chlorpheniramine
(10.1%)
and
piroxicam (10.1%) were also found in more than one-tenth
of the samples. Compatible with the pattern of adulteration,
common reported indications for the use of these adulterated
products consisted of weight reduction (n = 179; 36.8%),
various pain conditions such as joint pain, gout and rheumatism
(n = 111; 22.8%), erectile dysfunction (n = 44; 9.0%), diabetes
(n = 43; 8.8%) and skin disorders such as eczema and psoriasis
(n = 29; 6.0%). Details of the various indications are shown in
Table 2. Sources of the adulterated pCMs or health products
as reported by the patients were available in 220 out of the
487 samples (45%). These sources included over-the-counter
drug stores (n = 74; 33.6%), the internet (n = 57; 25.9%),
Chinese medicine practitioners (n = 54; 24.5%), relatives
and friends (n = 26; 11.8%), beauty salons (n = 8; 3.6%)
and street vendor (n = 1; 0.5%). The samples were obtained
mainly in Hong Kong or mainland China, and occasionally
from other countries.
Overall, 263 (65.1%) patients had one or more adverse
effects that were attributable to the adulterated pCMs
or health products. Of these ascertained poisoning cases,
the severity was as follows: fatal (n = 2), severe (n = 14),
moderate (n = 204) and minor (n = 43). The major clinical
presentation of the patients was usually the known adverse
effects
of
anorectics,
corticosteroids,
oral
antidiabetic
agents, NSAIDs and animal thyroid tissue, which included
psychosis (n = 52), iatrogenic Cushing syndrome (n = 43),
hypoglycaemia (n = 41), palpitations (n = 30), renal impair-
ment (n = 30), abnormal thyroid function (n = 24), deranged
liver function (n = 23) and adrenal insufficiency (n = 18).
Details of the adulterated pCMs and health products, and
the associated clinical features of the 16 cases with fatal or
severe poisoning are summarized in Table 3.

 1992–1993 showed that 23.7% of 2609 pCM samples were
adulterated with synthetic drugs [3], while regular checks of
pCMs for undeclared drugs in Singapore between 1990 and
1997 revealed 32 (1.5%) adulterated pCMs out of 2080
samples [4]. A systematic review of the world literature
regarding adulteration of pCMs with synthetic drugs up to
2001 [13] identified 15 case reports and two case series,
involving a total of 19 patients and 21 patients, respectively,
together with six analytical investigations, the largest of
which was the previously mentioned study in Taiwan [3].
From the first entry in 2007 up to March 2017, the United
States Food and Drug Administration reported 795 tainted
products marketed as dietary supplements, with the main
product categories being sexual enhancement (362 entries),
weight loss (322 entries) and muscle building (90 entries)
[14]. Compared with these reports, which were mainly
routine surveillance data or case reports/series with a small
number of affected patients, the present study, to the authors’
knowledge, is the largest case series that reports an overview
of the use of various adulterated pCMs and health products
and the resulting adverse effects.
Sibutramine, an anorectic, was the single most common
adulterant in our study, while weight reduction was also the
most frequently reported indication for the use of these
adulterated products. Sibutramine was withdrawn from the
market in the United States and many other regions, including
Hong Kong, in 2010, owing to its association with increased
cardiovascular events and strokes. However, as illustrated in
our case series, the ban on this drug did not result in its eradica-
tion from illicit slimming products. The danger of this drug was
demonstrated in the fatal case in the present series: a 21-year-old
woman with good previous health developed ventricular fibril-
lation and cardiac arrest after the use of a slimming product
adulterated with sibutramine and N-desmethyl-sibutramine
for 1 month. The use of slimming products adulterated with
sibutramine has also been associated with acute psychosis [8],
which was the most common adverse effect encountered in
the present study.
Other banned drugs, such as phenolphthalein, fenflur-
amine, phenformin, phenylbutazone and phenacetin,
were also not uncommonly detected in these adulterated
pCMs and health products. These drugs were usually with-
drawn from the market owing to their higher toxicities – for
example, the potential carcinogenicity of phenolphthalein,
valvular heart disease and pulmonary hypertension associ-
ated
with
fenfluramine,
lactic
acidosis
associated
with
phenformin, agranulocytosis associated with phenylbuta-
zone, and the carcinogenicity and nephrotoxicity of phenac-
etin.
Adulteration
with
banned
drugs
is
therefore
a
particularly dangerous practice and could lead to potentially
fatal adverse effects. As shown in our cases, eight out of 16
cases of fatal or severe outcomes were attributed to various
banned drugs.
Drug analogues, for which the chemical structures are
substantially similar to those of the original compounds,
were
also
occasionally
identified
in
the
present
case
series.
Examples
included
analogues
of
anorectics
(N-nitrosofenfluramine,
N-desmethyl-sibutramine
and
N-bisdesmethyl-sibutramine) and analogues of erectile dys-
function drugs (acetildenafil, aminotadalafil, homosildenafil
and chloropretadalafil). These drug analogues, which are
not always able to be identified by conventional analytical
methods, were probably added to the illicit products in an
attempt to evade detection by regulatory authorities. The
presumption that these analogues have similar pharmaceu-
tical effects as the original drugs is unproven and, worse
still, they may lead to adverse effects that are different or
even more severe than those associated with the original
compounds.
The
association
of
liver
failure
with
N-nitrosofenfluramine, which has not been seen in fenflur-
amine, is one typical example [15].
It is not uncommon to find multiple adulterants in a sin-
gle pCM or health product. One of the severe poisoning cases
found in the present study was a 46-year-old man who devel-
oped secondary adrenal insufficiency, renal impairment and a
peptic ulcer after consuming a pCM with 17 adulterants, in-
cluding prednisone acetate and six NSAIDs, for 10 years. We
note that adulteration of products indicated for pain control
with corticosteroid and multiple NSAIDs is particularly com-
mon. This dangerous practice may lead to significant over-
dose, and the hazard will be compounded if the patient is
taking other adulterated products and prescribed Western
medications as well. In the present study, most of the adulter-
ants were added for obvious reasons – mainly to increase the
efficacy of the products and occasionally to prevent the
adverse effects of other adulterants (e.g. H2-antihistamines
with NSAIDs). Nevertheless, the motive for adding some of
the co-adulterants that were irrelevant to the claimed
therapeutic indications remained obscure. Contamination
or errors in the manufacturing process is one possible
explanation. The outbreak of hypoglycaemia caused by the

 sildenafil and glibenclamide in 2008 in Hong Kong and
Singapore illustrated the danger of these therapeutically
irrelevant co-adulterants [12, 16]. This outbreak also contributed
to the surge in the total number of cases identified in 2008.
All of the data in the current study originated from cases
referred to our laboratory as a result of suspected poisoning
or suspicion of adulteration, and hence cannot be extrapo-
lated to represent the exact prevalence of such illicit products
in the market. Nevertheless, our data, in a way, reflect a more
complete picture of the danger and toxicity of adulterated
pCMs or health products that can be obtained from various
easily accessible sources, with internet trade being one
example that is gaining popularity. To safeguard public
health, it is of paramount importance to enhance public
awareness of the risk of pCM/health product adulteration
and the associated potentially fatal adverse effects. The public
should be educated not to consume pCMs and health
products from dubious sources. In Hong Kong, citizens who
wish to use Chinese medicine are advised to consult a
Chinese medicine practitioner or use registered pCMs.
Frontline clinicians should have a high index of suspicion.
For suspected poisoning cases, a detailed drug history
including Chinese medicine and health products, together
with
a
toxicological
analysis
of
biological
and
drug
specimens, can help to confirm the diagnosis.
Conclusions
In the present study, we report 404 cases involving the use of
487 adulterated pCMs or health products, with a total of 1234
adulterants detected. A significant proportion of patients
(65.1%) had adverse effects that were attributable to these
illicit products, including 14 severe and two fatal cases.
Disguised as natural and safe products, these illicit pCMs
and health products are clearly hazardous to the public.
Intensive health education, as well as effective regulatory
control, are important measures to combat this problem.
