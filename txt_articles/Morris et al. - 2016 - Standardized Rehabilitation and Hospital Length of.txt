IMPORTANCE Physical rehabilitation in the intensive care unit (ICU) may improve the
outcomes of patients with acute respiratory failure.
OBJECTIVE To compare standardized rehabilitation therapy (SRT) to usual ICU care in acute
respiratory failure.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Single-center, randomized clinical trial at Wake Forest
Baptist Medical Center, North Carolina. Adult patients (mean age, 58 years; women, 55%)
admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation were
randomized to SRT (n=150) or usual care (n=150) from October 2009 through May 2014 with
6-month follow-up.
INTERVENTIONS Patients in the SRT group received daily therapy until hospital discharge,
consisting of passive range of motion, physical therapy, and progressive resistance exercise.
The usual care group received weekday physical therapy when ordered by the clinical team.
For the SRT group, the median (interquartile range [IQR]) days of delivery of therapy were 8.0
(5.0-14.0) for passive range of motion, 5.0 (3.0-8.0) for physical therapy, and 3.0 (1.0-5.0) for
progressive resistance exercise. The median days of delivery of physical therapy for the usual
care group was 1.0 (IQR, 0.0-8.0).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Both groups underwent assessor-blinded testing at ICU and
hospital discharge and at 2, 4, and 6 months. The primary outcome was hospital length of stay
(LOS). Secondary outcomes were ventilator days, ICU days, Short Physical Performance Battery
(SPPB) score, 36-item Short-Form Health Surveys (SF-36) for physical and mental health and
physical function scale score, Functional Performance Inventory (FPI) score, Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE) score, and handgrip and handheld dynamometer strength.
RESULTS Among 300 randomized patients, the median hospital LOS was 10 days (IQR, 6 to
17) for the SRT group and 10 days (IQR, 7 to 16) for the usual care group (median difference,
0 [95% CI, −1.5 to 3], P= .41). There was no difference in duration of ventilation or ICU care.
There was no effect at 6 months for handgrip (difference, 2.0 kg [95% CI, −1.3 to 5.4], P= .23)
and handheld dynamometer strength (difference, 0.4 lb [95% CI, −2.9 to 3.7], P = .82), SF-36
physical health score (difference, 3.4 [95% CI, −0.02 to 7.0], P= .05), SF-36 mental health
score (difference, 2.4 [95% CI, −1.2 to 6.0], P = .19), or MMSE score (difference, 0.6 [95% CI,
−0.2 to 1.4], P = .17). There were higher scores at 6 months in the SRT group for the SPPB
score (difference, 1.1 [95% CI, 0.04 to 2.1, P = .04), SF-36 physical function scale score
(difference, 12.2 [95% CI, 3.8 to 20.7], P = .001), and the FPI score (difference, 0.2 [95% CI,
0.04 to 0.4], P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients hospitalized with acute respiratory failure,
SRT compared with usual care did not decrease hospital LOS.

A
cute respiratory failure is associated with high mortal-
ity and prolonged morbidity, with impaired physical
function for many survivors. Interventions directed at
attenuatingtheprofoundmusclewastinginpatientswithacute
respiratory failure are patient-centered.1 Such therapies de-
signed to improve patient-reported weakness and impaired
physical function could reduce recovery time in patients with
acute respiratory failure. As well, such interventions could po-
tentiallyimprovelong-termhealth-relatedqualityoflife,which
for this population is commonly below normal following hos-
pital discharge.2-4 Reports have suggested that a rehabilita-
tion program, delivered by an intensive care unit (ICU) reha-
bilitation team, may be associated with reduced length of stay
(LOS)andimprovedphysicalfunction,althoughfindingstothe
contrary exist as well.5-11 This randomized clinical trial was de-
signed to test the hypothesis that early delivery of a standard-
ized, multifaceted ICU and hospital rehabilitation program
would decrease hospital LOS and improve physical function
for patients with acute respiratory failure.
Methods
Study Design and Oversight
The institutional review board at the enrolling hospital ap-
proved the clinical trial. Written consent was obtained from
participantsortheirlegallyauthorizedrepresentative.Raceand
ethnicity data were collected per the National Institutes of
Health reporting policy and determined by patient or surro-
gate self-reporting based on fixed categories. The study was a
single-center,assessor-blinded,randomizedinvestigationwith
2 groups: standardized rehabilitation therapy (SRT) and usual
care conducted at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Win-
ston Salem, North Carolina. The SRT group received rehabili-
tation therapy 7 days a week, from enrollment through hos-
pital discharge, including days spent in a regular floor bed. The
usual care group received routine care as dictated by the pa-
tient's attending physician from Monday through Friday. SRT
ended at hospital discharge. Both groups underwent testing
at ICU and hospital discharge, and at 2, 4, and 6 months after
enrollment by research personnel blinded to the randomiza-
tion assignment.
Study Patients
Inclusion criteria were admission to a medical ICU, being 18
years or older, mechanical ventilation via endotracheal tube
or noninvasive ventilation by mask, and an arterial oxygen par-
tial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2/FIO2) ratio less
than 300. Exclusion criteria were inability to walk without as-
sistance prior to the acute ICU illness (use of cane or walkers
were not exclusions), cognitive impairment prior to acute ICU
illnessdescribedbysurrogate,asnonverbal,acutestroke,body
mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by
height in meters squared) greater than 50, neuromuscular dis-
easeimpairingweaningfrommechanicalventilation,acutehip
fracture, unstable cervical spine or pathologic fracture, me-
chanically ventilated more than 80 hours or current hospital-
ization (including transferring hospital) more than 7 days, or-
ders for do not intubate on admission, considered to be
moribund by the primary attending, or enrolled in another re-
search study.
Randomization
Patients were randomly assigned, using a computer-
generated variably sized approach (in block sizes of 2, 4, 6,
or 8), to SRT or usual care.
Study Measurements and Procedures
The SRT protocol contained 3 exercise types: passive range of
motion, physical therapy, and progressive resistance exer-
cises, and was administered by a rehabilitation team for a total
of 3 separate sessions every day of hospitalization for 7 days
per week.6 The team comprised a physical therapist, an ICU
nurse, and a nursing assistant. Passive range of motion in-
cluded 5 repetitions for each upper and lower extremity joint.
Physical therapy included bed mobility, transfer training, and
balance training. These exercises included transfer to the edge
of the bed; safe transfers to and from bed, chair, or commode;
seated balance activities; pregait standing activities (forward
and lateral weight shifting, marching in place); and ambula-
tion.Progressiveresistanceexerciseincludeddorsiflexion,knee
flexion and extension, hip flexion, elbow flexion and exten-
sion, and shoulder flexion. Resistance was added through the
use of elastic resistance bands (TheraBand, Hygienic Corpo-
ration). Both the physical therapy and resistance training tar-
geted lower extremity functional tasks and activities of daily
living (for further details of the implementation of SRT mo-
dalities, see trial protocol in Supplement 1).
The patient’s level of consciousness determined suitabil-
ity for receipt of physical therapy or progressive resistance ex-
ercise, and ability to complete the exercises.12 When patients
were unconscious, the 3 sessions consisted of passive range
of motion. Once the patient gained consciousness, physical
therapy and progressive resistance exercise were introduced.
Being free from mechanical ventilation was not a prerequi-
site for any of the exercise sessions. The usual care group re-
ceived no rehabilitation per treatment protocol. Physical
therapy could be ordered as part of routine care, but only Mon-
day through Friday.

SPPB scores were derived from performance of 3 components:
a 4-meter walk, chair sit-to-stand, and a balance test.13 Muscu-
lar strength of the shoulder flexors, elbow flexors and exten-
sors, hip flexors, knee flexors and extensors, and ankle dorsi-
flexors was measured thrice bilaterally. The maximum values
from each test were averaged to produce a single composite
value of muscular strength. Self-report tests consisted of the
short form Functional Performance Inventory (FPI),14 and the
physical functioning scale of the medical outcomes study 36-
Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36 PFS).15 Health-related
qualityoflifewasmeasuredusingtheSF-36physicalhealthsur-
vey (SF-36 PHS) and mental health survey (SF-36 MHS) com-
ponent summary scores and Mini-Mental State Examination

ICU discharge, hospital discharge and 2, 4, and 6 months after
enrollment. Health-related quality-of-life measures were ob-
tained at hospital discharge and 2, 4, and 6 months after en-
rollment. The SF-36 and the FPI were not administered at ICU
discharge as they were not considered relevant to the patient
at this time. The FPI was not administered at hospital dis-

to day 28.16 Adverse events were quantified by deaths, device
removals, reintubations, and patient falls during physical
therapy (for classification of adverse events, see trial protocol
in Supplement 1).
Statistical Analysis
The initial plan was to accrue 326 participants to provide 80%
power for detecting a 30% decrease in the median hospital LOS
at the 5% 2-sided level of significance assuming an exponen-
tial LOS distribution, a 20% in-hospital mortality, and that 5%
of the remaining patients would withdraw prior to discharge,
resulting in 247 discharges.
The projected 30% decrease in the primary outcome
(hospital LOS) is slightly larger than the decrease observed in
a previous quality improvement report,6 but, as described be-
low, there was a greater expected effect with the current in-
tervention due to a greater potential for exposure to the SRT
after ICU discharge in this study. An important feature of the
previous quality improvement report was that the interven-
tion was delivered only in the ICU. Hence, the effect reported
was for intervention delivered only in the ICU, not after ICU
discharge. Despite the intervention being limited to the ICU,
there was a 24% adjusted reduction in hospital LOS (hazard
ratio [HR], 1.31). The current study design delivered the SRT
from ICU admission through hospital discharge and due to the
addition of progressive resistance exercise, there was a much
greater clinical effect expected.
The in-hospital mortality and dropout were both less than
expected and enrollment was stopped after 300 patients were
accrued, 257 of whom were discharged.
Kaplan-MeiermethodswereusedtoestimatehospitalLOS,
and a log-rank test was used to assess the difference between
groups.Patientswhodiedordroppedoutbeforedischargewere
censored in the analyses. A Cox proportional hazards regres-
sionmodelwasusedtoestimatethehazardratio.Becausethere
were concerns that censoring (particularly from deaths) might
be informative, 2 extremes were considered—assuming all the
patients who died would have been discharged on the day of
their death and that all the patients who died would have had
the longest hospital stays. The same assumptions were made
regardingthepatientswhosimplywithdreweventhoughthere
islessreasontobelievethatthosewouldbeinformative.Analy-
ses were repeated under the possible combinations of assump-
tions regarding the deaths and dropouts. For each of these sce-
narios, unadjusted analyses and analyses adjusted for those
variables related to in-hospital death (sex, mean arterial pres-
sure, partial pressure of carbon dioxide [PaCO2], PaO2, FIO2, and
Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE]
score) were conducted. χ2 Tests were used to assess group dif-
ferences in-hospital and after discharge deaths and Wilcoxon
rank-sum tests were used to assess group differences in ven-
tilator-free and ICU-free days. Median differences of medi-
ans and 95% confidence intervals were generated using boot-
strapmethodswith10 000bootstrapsamples.Thesignificance
thresholdwasP < .05foreachoutcomeandtestingwas2-sided.
Due to the lack of adjustment for multiple testing, the second-
ary analyses should be considered exploratory. The statisti-
cal software was SAS (SAS Institute), version 9.4.
For secondary outcomes assessed longitudinally, a mixed-
effects repeated measures analysis of variance model was used
to assess differences in these measures between the SRT and
usual care groups at discharge, 2, 4, and 6 months. An un-
structured covariance matrix was used to account for the
within-patient correlation over time.
χ2 and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to assess dif-
ferences in patient characteristics between those patients with
and without missing data. Those characteristics predictive of
missingness (due either to death or withdrawal) were in-
cluded in the longitudinal mixed models. These covariates in-
cluded age, race, BMI, ICU diagnosis, mean arterial pressure,
PaCO2, PaO2/FIO2 ratio, APACHE score, and number of comor-
bid conditions. Multiple imputation was also used to assess the
sensitivity of the results to the missing at random assump-
tion. To be conservative, it was assumed that all dropouts
would follow a pattern similar to that seen among the control
patients (usual care group).17 One hundred data sets were gen-
erated using the SAS MI procedure (SAS Institute), a repeated
measures mixed model was run on each data set, and results
were combined using the SAS MIANALYZE procedure (SAS
Institute).18 Covariates related to missing data were included
in the imputations and in the adjusted mixed models. The im-
putation analyses included all patients.
Results
Study Patients
From October 2009 through November 2014, 4804 patients
with acute respiratory failure were screened, 618 were eli-
gible, and 300 were randomized (Figure 1) and followed up
for up to 6 months after the enrollment date (last follow-up
visit, November 2014). There were 84 patients in the SRT
group (56%) vs 81 in the usual care group (54%) who com-

pleted the 6-month follow-up. There were no clinically
important differences in baseline characteristics between
the 2 groups (Table 1).
Study Interventions
For the SRT group, the median days to first therapy exercise
were 1 (interquartile range [IQR], 0-2) for passive range of
motion, 3 (IQR, 1-6) for physical therapy, and 4 (IQR, 2-7) for
progressive resistance exercise, whereas the days to first
therapy exercise for the usual care group were 7 (IQR, 4-10).
The mean percentage of study days SRT patients received
therapy was 87.1% (SD, 18.4%) for passive range of motion,
54.6% (SD, 27.2%) for physical therapy, and 35.7% (SD,
23.0%) for progressive resistance exercise. The mean per-
centage of study days usual care patients received physical
therapy was 11.7% (SD, 14.5%). For the SRT group, the median
days of delivery of therapy per participant was 8.0 (IQR, 5.0-
14.0) for passive range of motion, 5.0 (IQR, 3.0-8.0) for physi-
cal therapy, and 3.0 (IQR, 1.0-5.0) for progressive resistance
exercise. The median days of delivery of physical therapy for
the usual care group was 1.0 (IQR, 0.0-8.0).
Primary Outcomes and Hospital Data
The median hospital LOS was 10 days (IQR, 6 to 17) for the
SRT group and 10 days (IQR, 7 to 16) for the usual care group
(median difference, 0 [95% CI, −1.5 to 3], P = .41) (Table 2
and Figure 2). The estimated hazard ratio (SRT to usual
care) was 1.11 (95% CI, 0.86 to 1.45). There were no differ-
ences between groups in the number of days taking a vaso-
pressor, Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU–positive
days, days receiving intravenous sedative drugs, days
with restraint, or net ICU-related fluid balance (Table 2).
Sensitivity analyses were performed for the primary out-
come as described in the methods. The assumptions regard-
ing the censored observations made little difference to
the outcome, with a median 9 to 10 days in the SRT group
and 10 days in the usual care group across the various sce-
narios. Hazard ratios ranged from 1.03 to 1.11 (with SRT
patients more likely to get discharged) unadjusted for covar-
iates and from 1.06 to 1.18 after adjusting for those covari-
ates predictive of in-hospital death. The difference between
groups was nonsignificant in each sensitivity analysis
(P >.22).

Secondary Outcomes
Performance-based and self-reported measures of physical
function are shown in Table 3. None of the scores were sig-
nificantly different between groups at either ICU or hospital
discharge. Strength values from handgrip and from handheld
dynamometer did not differ between treatment groups at any
of the measurement time points. The SPPB, SF-36 PFS, and FPI
scores were not significantly different between groups at 2 or
4 months. However, each of these outcomes was signifi-
cantly greater in the SRT group at the 6-month follow-up visit.
At hospital discharge there was no difference in the propor-
tion of SRT patients who could perform the 4-meter walk vs
usual care (71% vs 61%, P = .15). By 6 months, those percent-
ages had increased to 96% for the SRT group vs 88% for the
usual care group (P = .037).
Health-related quality-of-life measures are shown in
Table 3. SF-36 PHS, SF-36 MHS, and MMSE scores were not sig-
nificantly different between groups at any time points.
The estimated intervention effects when analyses were
repeated using multiple imputation assuming conserva-
tively that all dropouts followed the pattern seen in the con-
trol group were decreased by approximately 40%. For
example, the intervention effects at 6 months decreased
from 1.06 to 0.60 for SPPB, 12.2 to 7.3 for SF-36 PFS, 0.21 to
0.12 for FPI, and 3.39 to 2.12 for SF-36 PHS. Only the SF-36
PFS effect remained significant (P = .04); the other P values
were .11 for FPI, .16 for SPPB, and .19 for SF-36 PHS.
Outpatient physical therapy was not an intervention per
treatment protocol; there was no difference in the number of
patients (self-reported at each follow-up visit) who received
outpatient or home physical therapy between hospital dis-
charge and the 6-month follow-up visit (41 SRT patients vs 39
usual care patients, P = .69).
There were no differences in discharge destination be-
tween the SRT group and the usual care group (ie, home, long-
term acute care, skilled nursing, or rehabilitation hospital)
(eTable 1 in Supplement 2). Similarly, there were no differ-
ences between groups in post-index hospitalization readmis-
sions or discharge emergency department visits without a hos-
pital readmission. The percentage of each study group
discharged from the hospital who were alive and hospital re-
admission–free at 6 months was 48.7% for the SRT group and
44.7% for the usual care group (P = .63). Post-hoc analyses in-
dicated that the median number of ventilator-free days was
24 for both groups (median difference, 0 [95% CI, −2 to 1],
P = .59), and the median number of ICU-free days was 19 for
both groups (median difference, 0 [95% CI, −1.5 to 3], P = .83).
Missing Data
Death during the hospital stay was less than expected (12% ob-
served vs 20% expected) as was death during the follow-up
period (12% observed vs 15% expected). Dropout during the
hospital stay was also less than expected (2% observed vs 5%
expected).However,dropoutduringfollow-upwasgreaterthan
expected (24% observed from discharge to 6-month fol-
low-up vs 10% expected). Neither dropout nor mortality dif-
fered between the study groups. Characteristics of those with
and without missing data and those who did and did not drop
out are shown in eTable 2 and eTable 3 in Supplement 2. Char-
acteristics were fairly well balanced for those patients who re-

analyses, APACHE III scores were lower (better) in the usual
care group.
Adverse Events
There were no differences in adverse event reporting be-
tween study groups (eTable 4 in Supplement 2). The majority
of adverse events captured were not specifically related to SRT
delivery. Specific to SRT, there were no untoward events such
as endotracheal tube removal, vascular access device re-
moval,patientnear-fallorfall,orcardiacarrest.However,there
was an episode of asymptomatic bradycardia during a pro-
gressive resistance exercise session lasting less than 1 min-
ute, with the patient completing the session afterwards.

12% of the study days and never received resistance training.
In contrast, in the SRT group, passive range of motion oc-
curred in 87% of study days, physical therapy in 55%, and pro-
gressiveresistanceexercisein36%,withnosignificanthospital-
based outcome differences observed. The volume of exercise
delivered to SRT patients was delivered with 7 days per week
availability. This structure may differ from the current prac-
tice in many US ICUs.23 Others have also reported on the real-
life delivery of ICU-related exercise being less than expected
by ICU practitioners.24-26 In view of these data, it is unclear
what ICU exercise dose is required to affect outcomes by hos-
pital discharge for patients with acute respiratory failure.
Following discharge, handgrip strength or strength mea-
sured by handheld dynamometer and health-related quality
of life remained similar for the 2 groups. But from these ex-
ploratory analyses, the physical function measures (SPPB,
SF-36 PFS, and FPI) were different at 6 months. The separa-
tion of the 2 groups’ self-reported and objectively measured
functional data over 6 months of follow-up contrasts with the
lack of difference for hospital-centered outcomes.
These findings from the exploratory analyses may high-
light the emerging role of placing long-term outcomes within
critical care clinical trial design not only as a secondary out-
come, but possibly as the primary outcome.27-30 In view of the
SPPB, SF-36 PFS, and FPI data at 6 months, the SRT group dem-
onstrated a potential signal of improvement compared with
the usual care group that was not evident at hospital dis-
charge. It is not obvious what aspect of the SRT may have ac-
counted for the differences at 6 months; however, both the
physical therapy and the progressive resistance training em-
phasized lower extremity function. The exposure in the hos-
pital may have inclined the SRT group to have greater move-
ment while in the outpatient setting.
The findings from this study contrast with the outcomes
of the study by Schweickert and colleagues,7 which found
greater improvements in activities of daily living at hospital
discharge in an early ICU rehabilitation group than the con-
trol group, but no difference in hospital LOS either. The study
by Walsh and colleagues31 reported post-ICU hospital-based
rehabilitation, including increased physical and nutritional
therapy, did not improve physical recovery or quality-of-life
scores at 3 months after enrollment. Outpatient-focused pa-
tient-level functional outcome differences were not detected
in the study by Denehy and colleagues,9 which linked an in-
patient rehabilitation exercise repertoire with outpatient ex-
ercise instructions for a cohort of patients who were critically
ill. Moss and colleagues32 found that an intensive physical
therapy program compared with a standard physical therapy
program in which the intensive program continued for up to
28 days from randomization, including the outpatient set-
ting, did not improve long-term physical functional perfor-
mance at 6 months.
Study limitations include a higher than expected drop-
out (lost to follow-up and withdrawals, 24%) following hos-
pital discharge. Also, there was no intervention following dis-
charge; future study of ICU-initiated rehabilitation programs
may need to include a bridge program of some outpatient ex-
ercise content to further optimize outcomes.31,33
Another potential limitation was that there was no explicit
sedation protocol; the lack of a sedation protocol may have al-
lowedpatientsinbothgroupstospendunnecessarydayseither
unconscious or with a positive Confusion Assessment Method
score.34,35 Given that the intervention group had approxi-
mately30%ofventilatordaysassociatedwithintravenouscon-
tinuousdripmedications,andpatientswereunarousableon15%
of ventilator days, sedation may have been a barrier to receipt
of early exercise. These data indicate the challenge of deliver-
ing a treatment modality requiring a conscious, engaged pa-
tient. Other modalities have been proposed such as functional
electrical stimulation for the unconscious patient.36 Addition-
ally, multiple tests may have led to a spurious significant find-
ing for the functional tests.
Conclusions
Amongpatientshospitalizedwithacuterespiratoryfailure,SRT
compared with usual care did not decrease hospital LOS.
