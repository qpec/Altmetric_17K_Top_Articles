�orange dots labeled with focal distances� used in this study, overlaid on MRI image of a mouse that

mm. BBBO is indicated by bright T1 contrast �MRI parameters: FLASH 2D, TE 3ms, TR 100 ms, slice

characterization based on manufacturer’s data, n�1. Scale bars are 1 mm in �a�‐�b�, and the panels 
are rendered at the same scale to enable comparison between them. The presence of skull, or other 
aberrating or reflecting tissues in vivo, can modify the appearance of the ultrasound beam, 
potentially resulting in a more complex pattern.

signal enhancement. �a� Percentage of time spent freezing in the fear recall context for ATAC mice 
treated with CNO or saline as a function of hM3Dq‐mCherry expression in dorsal CA3. A negative 
correlation exists for CNO‐treated mice, but not for saline‐treated mice.  Dorsal CA3 was chosen as a 
site of interest because it had the strongest and most consistent expression throughout the 
experimental cohort, thus making it directly comparable. N�24 mice analyzed. �b� Correlation 
between MRI signal in the FUS‐targeted area and hM4Di‐mCherry expression intensity. Lack of 
correlation suggests that variability in gene expression could be due to problematic tail‐vein 
injections of the virus, or imperfect correspondence between FUS‐BBBO delivery of viruses and 
small molecules such as Prohance �r2 � 0.01, N�8�.
