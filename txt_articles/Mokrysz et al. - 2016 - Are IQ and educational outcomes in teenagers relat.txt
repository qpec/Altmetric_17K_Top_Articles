Introduction
Cannabis use typically starts in adolescence, with heaviest use 
generally reported during the teenage years (Chen and Kandel, 
1995). An estimated 17% of 15–16 year olds in Europe and 34% 
in the United States have taken cannabis at least once (Hibell 
et al., 2012; Miech et al., 2015). In the previous month, cannabis 
was used by 7% (Europe) and 17% (US) of this age group, which 
compares to 57% (Europe) and 24% (US) using alcohol and 28% 
(Europe) and 7% (US) using cigarettes (Hibell et al., 2012; Miech 
et al., 2015). With current global debates around legalisation and 
medical uses of cannabis, research on whether the drug has detri-
mental cognitive effects, particularly for adolescents, is critically 
important for policy decisions.
Acutely, cannabis induces robust and dose-dependent epi-
sodic memory impairments (Curran et al., 2002; Ranganathan 
and D’Souza, 2006), with more mixed reports of impaired work-
ing memory, attention, psychomotor control, inhibition and 
abstract reasoning (Crane et al., 2013; Crean et al., 2011; 
Gonzalez, 2007). More debated is whether there are persistent 
cognitive effects of using cannabis. Although long-lasting neu-
ropsychological impairments have been reported (Crane et al., 
2013; Crean et al., 2011; Gonzalez, 2007; Grant et al., 2003; 
Pope et al., 2003; Ranganathan and D’Souza, 2006), many stud-
ies have been cross-sectional and cannot exclude the possibility 
of pre-existing group differences in cognitive ability.
To date, two longitudinal investigations have specifically 
assessed the link between cannabis use and IQ. One small-scale 
study of young adults (N=113, including 59 never-users of can-
nabis; Fried et al., 2005) found evidence of lower IQ in current 
but not former cannabis users. Recently, a prospective analysis 
of the Dunedin Longitudinal Study cohort (born 1972–1973; 
N=874, including 242 never-users of cannabis) found evidence 
of IQ decline in 38 year olds who became cannabis dependent 
after starting weekly cannabis use in adolescence, but not in 
those who became regular users later in adulthood (Meier et al., 
2012). The decline in IQ remained apparent even for those who 
were no longer regular cannabis users at the time of adult IQ 
assessment. These findings highlight the growing concern that 
adolescent cannabis use may be particularly detrimental to cog-
nitive development. However, determining causality is chal-
lenging, since we cannot assume that cannabis users and 
non-users would have developed along similar trajectories if 
cannabis use had not occurred (Rogeberg, 2013). Adolescents 
Are IQ and educational outcomes in  
teenagers related to their cannabis use?

Abstract
There is much debate about the impact of adolescent cannabis use on intellectual and educational outcomes. We investigated associations between 
adolescent cannabis use and IQ and educational attainment in a sample of 2235 teenagers from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. 
By the age of 15, 24% reported having tried cannabis at least once. A series of nested linear regressions was employed, adjusted hierarchically by 
pre-exposure ability and potential confounds (e.g. cigarette and alcohol use, childhood mental-health symptoms and behavioural problems), to test 
the relationships between cumulative cannabis use and IQ at the age of 15 and educational performance at the age of 16. After full adjustment, 
those who had used cannabis ⩾50 times did not differ from never-users on either IQ or educational performance. Adjusting for group differences 
in cigarette smoking dramatically attenuated the associations between cannabis use and both outcomes, and further analyses demonstrated robust 
associations between cigarette use and educational outcomes, even with cannabis users excluded. These findings suggest that adolescent cannabis use 
is not associated with IQ or educational performance once adjustment is made for potential confounds, in particular adolescent cigarette use. Modest 
cannabis use in teenagers may have less cognitive impact than epidemiological surveys of older cohorts have previously suggested.

who use cannabis regularly also tend to have higher rates of 
social adversity (von Sydow et al., 2002), early-onset behav-
ioural problems (Heron et al., 2013) and other adolescent sub-
stance use (Hibell et al., 2012), all of which may confound the 
relationships between cannabis use and poorer intellectual and 
educational outcomes.
Relatedly, there is a wide evidence base linking adolescent 
cannabis use to early school leaving and poorer educational per-
formance (Fergusson et al., 2003; Lynskey and Hall, 2000; 
Lynskey et al., 2003; McCaffrey et al., 2010; Silins et al., 2014; 
Stiby et al., 2014). Typically, these associations are robust to 
adjustment for potential confounds, and one explanation for 
these findings is that cannabis use negatively impacts on cogni-
tive ability and therefore academic performance. However, the 
possibility of group differences in pre-exposure school perfor-
mance is often not addressed, and adjustment for other related 
adolescent behaviours, such as use of other substances, has been 
limited. As such, the existence of unmeasured confounds is often 
posited as an explanation of negative associations with cannabis 
(Fergusson et al., 2003; Lynskey and Hall, 2000; McCaffrey 
et al., 2010). Indeed, this is supported by recent genetic studies 
that found no difference in early school leaving between both 
monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs who were discordant for 
cannabis use (Grant et al., 2012; Verweij et al., 2013).
Here, we examined the associations between adolescent can-
nabis use and both IQ and educational attainment within a large 
adolescent cohort sample. Assessing intellectual and educational 
outcomes in the same longitudinal cohort, with similar con-
founder adjustment, enables better integration of findings across 
both domains. We considered several factors commonly associ-
ated with teenage cannabis use that may account for previously 
reported associations with IQ and educational performance. In 
particular, we addressed the role of other drug use, using detailed 
measures of cigarette, alcohol and other recreational drug use. 
We hypothesised that cannabis use would be associated with both 
IQ and educational performance. However, these associations 
may be attenuated by adjusting for confounders.
Methods
Sample
Participants were members of the Avon Longitudinal Study of 
Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort, a prospective study in 
Bristol (UK) following women and their children since preg-
nancy. ALSPAC recruited pregnant mothers from the former 
Avon Health Authority, England, with an expected delivery date 
from April 1991 to December 1992. The core cohort comprised 
14,541 pregnancies, with 13,988 babies alive at one year (Boyd 
et al., 2013). Following later recruitment of eligible cases that 
were not initially recruited, the cohort now comprises 15,458 
foetuses, with 14,701 babies alive at one year. IQ scores at both 8 
and 15 years of age were available for 4621 participants. Of 
these, and after exclusions (n=41: mother reported child head 
injury resulting in unconsciousness, n=38; child indicated use of 
imaginary drug ‘spanglers’ (a fictional drug included in the ques-
tionnaire to test veracity of participants’ responses) since 15th 
birthday, n=3), 2235 individuals had complete data for all key 
variables and confounders, and so were included in the main 
analyses (complete-case sample; see Figure S1 for participant 
flow diagram). The study website contains details of all available 
data through a fully searchable data dictionary (http://www.bris.
ac.uk/alspac/researchers/data-access/data-dictionary). 
Ethical 
approval was obtained from ALSPAC Law and Ethics Committee.
Measures
Cannabis use. Participants provided cumulative lifetime canna-
bis use data at the age of 15, via a self-report questionnaire 
administered during attendance at clinic sessions. Initial 
responses were categorical, with six levels: ‘never’, ‘less than 
 
5 times’, ‘5–19 times’, ‘20–49 times’, ‘50–99 times’ and ‘100 
times or more’. For the present study, sample size considerations 
resulted in the two highest levels being combined into one 
response level of ‘50 times or more’, creating a five-level cate-
gorical variable of cumulative cannabis use.
IQ. Participants were administered the Wechsler Intelligence 
Scale for Children 3rd Edition (WISC-III; Wechsler, 1991) at an 
individual clinic session at the age of 8. Alternate items of the 
WISC-III were administered for all sections, apart from the coding 
subtest for which all items were included. IQ measurements were 
calculated for each individual, adjusting for age. At the age of 15, 
participants were administered the Vocabulary and Matrix Reason-
ing subsections of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence 
(WASI; Wechsler, 1999). IQ was again calculated for each indi-
vidual, adjusting for age. To ease interpretation, IQ scores were 
rescaled around the complete-case sample included in the present 
analysis, to a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15.
Educational performance. In England, children attending 
state-maintained schools are educated in line with the National 
Curriculum, which defines what subjects must be taught and the 
standards children should reach at each stage. The Curriculum is 
split into a series of ‘Key Stages’, which are assessed by compul-
sory teacher assessments or national tests at the end of each stage 
(for further information, see www.gov.uk/national-curriculum/
overview). Data linkage between ALSPAC and the National Pupil 
Database (a central repository for pupil-level educational data in 
England) provided educational assessment data for participants 
who attended state-funded schools at Key Stages 2 (age 11) and 4 
(age 16). Data linkage was performed by a third-party company 
and checked by the ALSPAC team (for further information, see 
www.adls.ac.uk/department-for-education/dcsf-npd/?detail). 
Raw scores at the age of 11, when children sit Key Stage 2 tests 
for Maths, English and Science, were converted to percentages 
and averaged across the three subjects. Educational performance 
at the age of 16, when pupils complete Key Stage 4 national testing, 
was quantified using a standard capped scoring method (see http://
nationalpupildatabase.wikispaces.com/KS4) in which grades 
achieved at General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) 
or equivalent for their best eight subjects are converted to a 
numerical score (e.g. A*=58 points … G=16 points) and summed. 
Capped scores, out of a maximum possible score of 464, were 
then converted to a percentage.
Potential confounds
Potential confounds were chosen in accordance with theoretical 
considerations and previous literature to reflect variables associ-
ated with adolescent cannabis use and intellectual and educational

outcomes: 1. maternal and early-life factors (Fergusson et al., 
1990; Fergusson and Horwood, 1997; Heron et al., 2013; von 
Sydow et al., 2002): maternal education [none/Certificate of 
Secondary Education, O-levels, A-levels, degree]; child sex; 
maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy and up to eight 
months postnatal [mother completed depression items of the 
Crown–Crisp experiential index (CCEI); Crisp et al., 1978]; 
maternal substance use during the first three months of 
 
pregnancy [alcohol use: none, less than weekly, at least weekly; 
cigarette use: no, yes; cannabis use: no, yes]; 2. childhood 
behavioural factors (Heron et al., 2013; Lynskey and Fergusson, 
1995; Shedler and Block, 1990): hyperactivity and conduct 
problems at age 11 [mother completed Strengths and Difficulties 
Questionnaire; Goodman, 1997]; mother suspected truancy at 
age 14 [no, yes]; 3. childhood mental health (Degenhardt et al., 
2003; Patton et al., 2002): depressive symptoms at age 12 [child 
completed depression items of the Short Mood and Feelings 
Questionnaire; Angold et al., 1995]; psychotic-like symptoms at 
age 12 [child completed PLIKSi semi-structured interview; 
Zammit et al., 2013]; 4. other adolescent drug use (Chamberlain 
et al., 2012; Fergusson and Horwood, 2000; Fergusson et al., 
2006; Patton et al., 2005; Rob et al., 1990; Stiby et al., 2014): 
cumulative cigarette use self-reported at age 15 [never, 1–4, 5–20, 
21–60, 61–100, >100 times]; cumulative alcohol use self-reported 
at age 15 [never, 1–5, 6–19, 20–39, 40–99, ⩾100 times]; and 
other recreational drug use since 15th birthday, including 
 
ketamine, LSD, cocaine, ecstasy, amphetamine and inhalants, 
self-reported at age 15 [none, used one other drug, used more than 
one other drug].
Statistical analyses
Analyses were conducted using Stata/SE v13.1 (StataCorp LP, 
College Station, TX). A series of nested linear least-squares 
regression analyses was employed and adjusted by potential con-
founders to test the relationships between cumulative cannabis 
use and (a) IQ at the age of 15 and (b) educational performance 
at the age of 16.
Unadjusted estimates of the relationship between cumulative 
cannabis use (dummy-coded from 1 to 5, representing the catego-
ries explained above) and IQ age 15 (Model IQ1) were compared 
to adjusted estimates derived from a series of nested models that 
additionally included: first, pre-exposure IQ at the age of 8 
(Model IQ2); then, in addition to IQ2, maternal, early-life and 
childhood behavioural factors (Model IQ3); then, in addition to 
IQ3, adolescent mental-health factors (Model IQ4); then, in addi-
tion to IQ4, cigarette use (Model IQ5a), alcohol use (Model 
IQ5b), or other drug use (Model IQ5c); finally, a fully adjusted 
model (Model IQ6) which included all potential confounds.
Unadjusted estimates of the relationship between cumulative 
cannabis use (again dummy-coded from 1 to 5, representing the 
categories explained above) and educational performance at the 
age of 16 (Model Ed1) were compared to adjusted estimates 
derived from a series of nested models that initially included edu-
cational performance at age 11 (Model Ed2). Models Ed3–6 were 
then adjusted as for Models IQ3–6.
Multiple imputation analyses
For clarity, we have focused primarily on the results of the com-
plete-case analyses. However, to supplement these findings, we 
repeated planned analyses after implementing multiple imputa-
tion with chained equations to account for missing data (20 impu-
tations, using the ice command in Stata). Multiple imputation 
was carried out for all participants alive at one year, resulting in 
a sample size of 14,552 after multiple imputation and exclusions. 
This method assumes data are missing at random (i.e. that the 
probability of a data point being missing depends only on 
observed data). Previously described guidelines were followed 
when selecting variables for the imputation model from the many 
variables collected by ALSPAC (Van Buuren et al., 1999). Due to 
the large number of variables that met these criteria, different sets 
of variables were selected for the imputation of groups of varia-
bles. Data were imputed for all outcome, key predictor and con-
founder variables. Full details of variables included in the 
imputation model are available from the authors on request.
Post hoc analyses
Post hoc linear least-squares regression analyses were then 
employed and adjusted by potential confounders to test the relation-
ships between cumulative cigarette use and (a) IQ at the age of 15 
and (b) educational performance at the age of 16, after exclusion of 
cannabis users. Unadjusted estimates of the relationship between 
cumulative cigarette use (binary outcome due to smaller sample: 
never used/ever used cigarettes) and (a) IQ age 15 (Model CigIQ1) 
were compared to fully adjusted estimates (Model CigIQ2), and 
 
(b) educational performance at the age of 16 (Model CigEd1) 
were compared to fully adjusted estimates (Model CigEd2).
Results
Of the complete-case data set (n=2235), 23.5% (n=526) reported 
having tried cannabis at least once, and 3.3% (n=74) reported 
cumulative usage of at least 50 times. Table 1 shows the demo-
graphics of the sample according to reported cumulative canna-
bis use at an average age of 15.4 years. Unadjusted analyses 
demonstrate that cannabis use was associated with maternal ciga-
rette and cannabis use during pregnancy, truancy from school, 
childhood hyperactivity, conduct problems and depressive symp-
toms, and adolescent cigarette, alcohol and other drug use.
Table 2 shows patterns of cannabis use according to cumula-
tive use groups. Within those who had tried cannabis at least 
once, greater exposure was associated with a younger age of first 
cannabis use (p<0.001) and a longer time since first usage 
(p<0.001). Those who had ⩾50 cannabis exposures had first used 
at a mean age of 13.1 years, and for a mean duration of 2.3 years. 
Of those with ⩾50 exposures, 98.7% had used in the past year, 
60.8% were currently using at least weekly and 47.3% had used 
in the three days prior to the IQ test. The majority (91.0%) usu-
ally mixed tobacco with their cannabis.
IQ
Unadjusted IQ data for the cannabis use groups can be found in 
Table 3. Model estimates are displayed in Figure 1 and Table S1. 
In the unadjusted analyses, no difference in IQ between the can-
nabis use groups was apparent (p=0.237). However, after adjust-
ing for IQ measured at the age of 8, cumulative cannabis use was 
negatively associated with IQ measured at the age of 15 (Model 
IQ2; p<0.001). Those who had used cannabis ⩾50 times were

estimated to have an IQ at the age of 15 that was 2.9 points 
lower than never-users in this model. Adjustment by maternal, 
early-life and childhood behavioural factors (Model IQ3) and 
by mental-health factors (Model IQ4) had little effect on point 
estimates. Adjustment for cigarette (Model IQ5a), alcohol 
(Model IQ5b) or other substance use (Model IQ5c) attenuated 
the association between cannabis use and IQ at the age of 15, 
with cigarette use having the most marked influence. Model 
IQ6 fully attenuated the association between cannabis use and 
IQ at the age of 15 (p=0.959), with cumulative use of ⩾50 times 
now predicting an adjusted IQ score of 0.1 (p=0.941) lower 
relative to never-users.
Educational performance
Unadjusted educational performance data for the cannabis use 
groups are shown in Table 3. Model estimates are displayed in 
Figure 2 and Table S2. Increasing cumulative cannabis use cor-
related with poorer educational performance at the age of 16 
(p<0.001). Cannabis use of ⩾50 times predicted an average score 
of 11.6 percentage points lower than never-users (p<0.001). After 
adjusting for educational performance at the age of 11, cannabis 
use remained associated with educational performance at the age 
of 16 (Model Ed2; p < 0.001); those who had used cannabis ⩾50 
times were estimated to have scored 11.0 percentage points lower

than never-users (p < 0.001). Adjustment by maternal, early-life 
and childhood behavioural factors (Model Ed3) and mental-
health factors (Model Ed4) had little effect on point estimates. 
Adjustment by alcohol (Model Ed5a), cigarette (Model Ed5b) or 
other substance use (Model Ed5c) attenuated the association 
between cannabis use and educational performance at the age of 
16, with cigarette use again having the most marked influence. 
Model Ed6 fully attenuated the association between cannabis use 
and educational performance at the age of 16 (p=0.184), with 
cumulative use ⩾50 times now predicting an adjusted score of 
2.2 (p=0.083) percentage points lower than never-users.
Cigarettes
In the above analyses, cumulative cigarette use was the key atten-
uator of the association between cumulative cannabis use and 
both IQ (see Models IQ5a and IQ6) and educational performance 
(see Models Ed5a and Ed6). Further, cumulative cigarette use 
remained negatively associated with both outcomes in the fully 
adjusted models. Those who had used cigarettes >100 times were 
estimated to have an age 15 adjusted IQ 3.2 points lower 
(p=0.018) and an adjusted educational score 7.4 percentage 
points lower (p<0.001) than never-users of cigarettes (see Tables 
S3 and S4).
To explore these relationships further, we investigated asso-
ciations with cigarette use in those who had never used cannabis 
(Table 4a). Of the complete-case sample, 76.4% (n=1709) had 
never tried cannabis, of which 13.9% (n=237) reported having 
tried cigarettes at least once. Analyses were repeated on this 
restricted sample with ever-use of cigarettes as the primary pre-
dictor (Table 4b). With adjustment for only pre-exposure IQ or 
educational performance, respectively, ever-use of cigarettes was

associated with an age 15 IQ 6.2 points lower (p<0.001; Model 
CigIQ1), and educational performance 7.8 percentage points 
lower (p<0.001; Model CigEd1), relative to never-users of ciga-
rettes. After full adjustment, these relationships were somewhat 
attenuated, with ever-use of cigarettes now predicting an age 15 
adjusted IQ 1.5 points lower (p=0.083; Model CigIQ2), and edu-
cational performance 2.9 percentage points lower (p<0.001; 
Model CigEd2), relative to never-users of cigarettes.
Multiple imputation analyses
Key variables were compared for participants who were included 
in the complete-case analysis and the available data for the par-
ticipants who had missing data but were alive at one year (Table 
S5). Drop-out was related to a range of variables, including pre-
cannabis exposure IQ score at the age of 8. To investigate whether 
drop-out may have influenced the results, we conducted multiple 
imputation to supplement the main analyses, resulting in a large 
imputed data set (n=14,552).
Point estimates and the patterns of attenuation observed after 
adjusting hierarchically for potential confounds were similar for 
the complete and imputed case analyses. However, while for the 
unadjusted complete-case IQ analysis (Model IQ1) there was no 
difference in IQ between cannabis use groups, for the unadjusted 
imputed analysis lower scores were associated with greater can-
nabis use (Table S6, Model IQ1i). Additionally, for the complete-
case education analyses, adjustment for cigarette use (Models 
Ed5a) did not fully attenuate the association between cannabis use 
and educational performance. However, in the imputed analyses, 
this association was fully attenuated (Table S7, Models Ed5ai).
Discussion
In line with previous work, we found that cannabis users had 
lower teenage IQ scores and poorer educational performance 
than teenagers who had never used cannabis. At the same time, 
cannabis users also had higher rates of childhood behavioural 
problems, childhood depressive symptoms, other substance use 
(including use of cigarettes and alcohol) and maternal use of can-
nabis during pregnancy. After adjustment to account for these 
group differences, cannabis use by the age of 15 did not predict 
either lower teenage IQ scores or poorer educational perfor-
mance. These findings therefore suggest that cannabis use at the 
modest levels used by this sample of teenagers is not by itself 
causally related to cognitive impairment. Instead, our findings 
imply that previously reported associations between adolescent 
cannabis use and poorer intellectual and educational outcomes 
may be confounded to a significant degree by related factors.
While we found no evidence of a robust link between adoles-
cent cannabis use and IQ, previous work has indeed shown that 
persistent cannabis dependence starting with regular cannabis 
use in adolescence is associated with IQ decline by middle age 
(Meier et al., 2012). Together, these findings suggest that while 
persistent cannabis dependence may be linked to declining IQ 
across a person’s lifetime, teenage cannabis use alone does not 
appear to predict worse IQ outcomes in adolescents. The present 
findings also highlight the importance of considering other ado-
lescent substance use alongside cannabis, in particular cigarette 
use, when assessing links between cannabis and intellectual out-
comes, and this confound may contribute to previously reported 
associations between cannabis dependence and IQ decline. 
However, the young age at which our outcomes were measured, 
and the relatively modest levels of cannabis use in the present 
sample, do not allow us to rule out the possibility of future diffi-
culties, perhaps following further cannabis exposure. Assessing 
outcomes at this young age, before the end of compulsory educa-
tion, does however have the benefit of reducing the potentially 
confounding influence of selection into or out of cognitively 
demanding environments throughout a person’s life on IQ perfor-
mance (Rogeberg, 2013).
Attenuation of the association between cannabis use and edu-
cational performance contrasts with previous work demonstrat-
ing a robust relationship even after adjustment for confounders

(Lynskey and Hall, 2000; Lynskey et al., 2003; Silins et al., 2014; 
Stiby et al., 2014). Notably, however, previous work reporting 
associations between cannabis use and poorer educational out-
comes has not consistently addressed the possibility of group dif-
ferences in pre-exposure educational performance or in rates of 
other substance use, which may explain differences between our 
findings and previous work. Indeed, our findings are in accord-
ance with recent genetic studies that found no difference in early 
school leaving between both monozygotic and dizygotic twin 
pairs who were discordant for cannabis use (Grant et al., 2012; 
Verweij et al., 2013).
Compared with those in our sample who had never tried can-
nabis, teenagers who had used cannabis at least 50 times were 
17 times more likely (84% vs. 5%) to have smoked cigarettes 
more than 20 times in their lifetime. Accounting for group dif-
ferences in cigarette smoking dramatically attenuated the asso-
ciations between cannabis use and both IQ and educational 
performance. Further, even after excluding those who had never 
tried cannabis, cigarette users were found to have lower educa-
tional performance (adjusted performance 2.9 percentage points 
lower, approximately equivalent to dropping two grades on one 
subject taken at GCSE) relative to those who had never tried 
cigarettes. A relationship between cigarette use and poorer cog-
nitive (Chamberlain et al., 2012; Hooper et al., 2014; Weiser 
et al., 2010; Whalley et al., 2005) and educational (McCaffrey 
et al., 2010; Silins et al., 2014; Stiby et al., 2014) outcomes has 
been noted previously, and may have a number of explanations. 
Cigarette use may have a negative impact on cognitive ability. 
However, this is not supported by the experimental psychophar-
macology literature, which robustly shows that acute nicotine 
administration results in transient cognitive enhancement 
(Heishman et al., 2010). Alternatively, reverse causality may 
contribute to this relationship, for example performing poorly 
at school may lead to increased engagement in risky behaviours 
such as cigarette smoking. Further, residual confounding may 
contribute to this link: cigarette smoking may be a marker of 
unmeasured factors, for example social adversity during ado-
lescence, that influence both IQ and educational attainment.
Overwhelmingly, the most common method of cannabis 
administration was smoking it combined with tobacco (as is typi-
cal in the UK), potentially making it difficult to separate the 
 
independent contributions of cannabis and tobacco use on the out-
comes. However, as noted above, lower educational performance 
remained apparent for cigarette smokers who had never used can-
nabis, even following adjustment for potential confounders. This 
suggests that it may be cigarette use, rather than tobacco con-
sumption per se, that predicts poorer educational outcomes, 
potentially lending support to a non-pharmacological mechanism 
to explain links between cigarette use and poorer outcomes. 
Cigarette use has recently been highlighted as an important factor 
when exploring links between cannabis use and various outcomes, 
including psychotic-like experiences (Gage et al., 2014), educa-
tional outcomes (Stiby et al., 2014) and cannabis dependence 
(Hindocha et al., 2015). The relationship between cannabis and 
tobacco and/or cigarette use is complex, and there is a need to 
delineate the contribution of these substances when used alone 
and in combination (Schuster et al., 2015). This would be helped 
by improved measures of tobacco and cannabis consumption, and 
by comparing findings from cohorts with differing degrees of 
combined cannabis/tobacco administration.
A number of measurement limitations of the present study 
should be noted. Firstly, classification of cannabis users into 
groups based on self-reported cumulative uses does not provide 
information on actual dose (of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol; 
THC), which varies according to cannabis weight and particular 
strain, as well as how the user titrates the dose (Freeman et al., 
2014; Temple et al., 2011; van der Pol et al., 2014). This is a limi-
tation of all cohort-based research to date, since objective bio-
logical markers (e.g. of cannabinoids in hair) are not typically 
collected. It is noteworthy that the ALSPAC cohort, born in the 
early nineties, may have been exposed to higher THC potency 
varieties than earlier cohorts, which may be expected to have 
made cognitive impairment more rather than less likely. Secondly, 
an abbreviated WASI was used for IQ assessment at the age of 
15, which provides a less reliable estimate of IQ than full-scale 
tests (Axelrod, 2002). However, as all the participants completed 
the same assessments, our comparisons remain valid.
Further, nearly half of those who had used cannabis at least 50 
times reported having used it in the three days prior to their age 
15 IQ assessments. Experimental research with humans has sug-
gested that cognitive impairments seen up to six hours after acute 
oral doses of THC do not persist 24 or 48 hours later (Curran 
et al., 2002). However, a recent meta-analysis demonstrates that 
residual cognitive effects of chronic cannabis exposure may last 
approximately one month following abstinence from the drug 
(Schreiner and Dunn, 2012). Sample-size considerations meant 
that we could not assess the impact of excluding recent cannabis 
smokers from analyses, but future work, perhaps with the 
ALSPAC sample at an older age, should address the possibility of 
residual effects directly. Nevertheless, despite high levels of 
recent cannabis usage, we found no robust association between 
cannabis use and poorer IQ performance.
In summary, the notion that cannabis use itself is causally 
related to lower IQ and poorer educational performance was not 
supported in this large teenage sample. However, this study 
indeed has limitations, in particular the young age of outcome 
assessment. While we have demonstrated that confounding may 
be an explanation for links between cannabis use and poorer out-
comes, large prospective cohorts tracking young people prior to, 
during and after stopping cannabis use, using more objective 
measures of drug use (e.g. the new NIH-funded ‘ABCD study’ in 
the United States; National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2015) are 
required before we can make strong conclusions. Cigarette smok-
ing in particular has once again (Hooper et al., 2014; McCaffrey 
et al., 2010; Silins et al., 2014; Stiby et al., 2014) been high-
lighted as an important factor in adolescent outcomes, as well as 
a robust independent predictor of educational performance, and 
the reasons for this need to be elucidated. With ongoing debates 
about cannabis and tobacco legislation around the world, and the 
impact this could have on drug availability to teenagers, it is 
important that we can provide accurate information about drug 
harms regardless of whether the drug in question is legal or not.
