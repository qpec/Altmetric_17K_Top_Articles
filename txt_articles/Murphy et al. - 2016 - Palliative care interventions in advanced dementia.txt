Background
Dementia is a chronic, progressive and ultimately fatal neurodegenerative disease. Advanced dementia is characterised by profound
cognitive impairment, inability to communicate verbally and complete functional dependence. Usual care of people with advanced
dementia is not underpinned universally by a palliative approach. Palliative care has focused traditionally on care of people with cancer
but for more than a decade, there have been increased calls worldwide to extend palliative care services to include all people with life-
limiting illnesses in need of specialist care, including people with dementia.
Objectives
To assess the effect of palliative care interventions in advanced dementia and to report on the range of outcome measures used.
Search methods
We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group’s Specialized Register on 4 February 2016. ALOIS
contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of several major healthcare databases, trial registries and grey literature
sources. We ran additional searches across MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost),
LILACS (BIREME), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Science), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization
ICTRP trial portal to ensure that the searches were as comprehensive and as up-to-date as possible.
Selection criteria
We searched for randomised (RCT) and non-randomised controlled trials (nRCT), controlled before-and-after studies (CBA) and
interrupted time series studies evaluating the impact of palliative care interventions for adults with dementia of any type, staged as
advanced dementia by a recognised and validated tool. Participants could be people with advanced dementia, their family members,
clinicians or paid care staff. We included clinical interventions and non-clinical interventions. Comparators were usual care or another
palliative care intervention. We did not exclude studies on the basis of outcomes measured and recorded all outcomes measured in
included studies.

 Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed for inclusion all the potential studies we identified as a result of the search strategy. We
resolved any disagreement through discussion or, when required, consulted with the rest of the review team. We independently extracted
data and conducted assessment of methodological quality, using standard Cochrane methods.
Main results
We identified two studies of palliative care interventions for people with advanced dementia. We did not pool data due to the
heterogeneity between the two trials in terms of the interventions and the settings. The two studies measured 31 different outcomes,
yet they did not measure the same outcome. There are six ongoing studies that we expect to include in future versions of this review.
Both studies were at high risk of bias, in part because blinding was not possible. This and small sample sizes meant that the overall
certainty of all the evidence was very low.
One individually randomised RCT (99 participants) evaluated the effect of a palliative care team for people with advanced dementia
hospitalised for an acute illness. While this trial reported that a palliative care plan was more likely to be developed for participants
in the intervention group (risk ratio (RR) 5.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37 to 25.02), the plan was only adopted for two
participants, both in the intervention group, while in hospital. The palliative care plan was more likely to be available on discharge in
the intervention group (RR 4.50, 95% CI 1.03 to 19.75). We found no evidence that the intervention affected mortality in hospital
(RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.13), decisions to forgo cardiopulmonary resuscitation in hospital or the clinical care provided during
hospital admission, but for the latter, event rates were low and the results were associated with a lot of uncertainty.
One cluster RCT (256 participants, each enrolled with a family carer) evaluated the effect of a decision aid on end-of-life feeding
options on surrogate decision-makers of nursing home residents with advanced dementia. Data for 90 participants (35% of the original
study) met the definition of advanced dementia for this review and were re-analysed for the purposes of the review. In this subset,
intervention surrogates had lower scores for decisional conflict measured on the Decisional Conflict Scale (mean difference -0.30, 95%
CI -0.61 to 0.01, reduction of 0.3 to 0.4 units considered meaningful) and were more likely than participants in the control group to
discuss feeding options with a clinician (RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.64), but imprecision meant that there was significant uncertainty
about both results.
Authors’ conclusions
Very little high quality work has been completed exploring palliative care interventions in advanced dementia. There were only two
included studies in this review, with variation in the interventions and in the settings that made it impossible to conduct a meta-analysis
of data for any outcome. Thus, we conclude that there is insufficient evidence to assess the effect of palliative care interventions in
advanced dementia. The fact that there are six ongoing studies at the time of this review indicates an increased interest in this area by
researchers, which is welcome and needed.

Palliative care for people with advanced dementia
Review question
In this research, we wanted to see if palliative care helps people with advanced dementia or helps their family or carers. We also wanted
to describe how researchers tried to measure the effect of palliative care.
Background
People with advanced dementia have serious memory problems and have problems making simple decisions. They are usually no longer
able to communicate by talking. They need a lot of help from their carers. People with advanced dementia can live for a long time. It
is very hard to say exactly how long a person with advanced dementia will live.
Palliative care (or end-of-life care) is a particular way of caring for people who have diseases that cannot be cured. The main aims of
palliative care are to reduce pain and to maintain the best possible quality of life as death approaches. Palliative care is used a lot with
people with cancer but is not used much for people with advanced dementia.
Study characteristics

 We examined the research published up to January 2016. We found only two suitable studies (189 people), both from the US. We also
found six studies that were underway but the results were not yet published.
Key results
One study found that having a small team of doctors and nurses trained in palliative care made little difference to how people with
advanced dementia were treated while in hospital. But, having this special team meant that more people had a palliative care plan
when they were discharged from hospital. The other study measured if giving written information to relatives explaining the different
methods that can be used to feed people with advanced dementia helped either the relatives or the person. This study found that giving
relatives this information made it a little easier for relatives to make decisions about what methods would be used to feed the person
with dementia.
Certainty of evidence
We only found two studies and the two palliative care methods in these studies were very different. We cannot be very certain about
how accurate either of these results reported here are, partly because only a small number of people took part in the studies. So from
these studies, it is hard to be sure whether palliative care makes a difference to people with advanced dementia.
Final thoughts
Little research has been done about people with advanced dementia, often because of ethical concerns. However, although it is hard
to do research with people with dementia, more well-designed studies are required to work out how palliative care can be used best in
this special population.

GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High certainty: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect
Moderate certainty: We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is
substantially different
Low certainty: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect
Very low certainty: We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect

Description of the condition
Dementia is a chronic, progressive and ultimately fatal neurode-
generative disease with several different causes. It is estimated that
there were 44.35 million people worldwide living with demen-
tia in 2013 (Prince 2013). This prevalence is projected to double
every 20 years to approximately 135.46 million by 2050 (WHO
2012). The incidence of dementia is estimated at 7.7 million new
cases per year, or one new case every four seconds and the preva-
lence doubles with every five-year increment in age after 65 years.
In a 10-year longitudinal study of 18,248 people aged 65 years
and over in the UK, the overall prevalence of dementia at death
was 30% and there was a marked increase in such deaths with age:
from 6% of people aged 65 to 69 years up to 58% of people aged
95 years and older at time of death (Brayne 2006). Therefore, the
provision of appropriate care to the growing number of older peo-
ple living and dying with dementia is an issue of immense clinical
and public health importance.
Although not a normal part of ageing, dementia affects mainly
older people, eroding their cognitive and functional abilities and
their social skills, often leading to an increase in challenging be-
haviours and low mood. People with dementia experience a grad-
ual decline in abilities over an extended period, but without abrupt
functional or physical health changes that can be used to clearly
identify the final, terminal phase of the disease. Advanced or end-
stage dementia is characterised by profound cognitive impairment,
inability to communicate verbally, complete functional depen-
dence, and often, dysphagia and double incontinence. People with
advanced dementia are at increased risk of infections, for example,
urinary tract infections and pneumonia, typically become bed-
or chair- bound, increasing the risk of developing pressure ulcers
(Capon 2007).
Advanced dementia is typically defined as having a formal diag-
nosis of dementia by a clinician, with dementia staged by a vali-
dated tool, for example, the Functional Assessment Staging Test
(FAST) (Reisberg 1982). Reported six-month mortality rates for
people with advanced dementia of 25% (Mitchell 2009), consis-
tent with high mortality rates among people with advanced de-
mentia from other studies (Morrison 2000a; Mitchell 2004), indi-
cate a life expectancy similar to that in conditions generally recog-
nised as terminal, for example, metastatic breast cancer (Mitchell
2009). Therefore, advanced dementia can be regarded as a termi-
nal condition, where the focus of much, though not necessarily all,
of the care provided is palliative, maximising comfort and qual-
ity of life, rather than curative. However, studies have shown that
people with advanced dementia are often subject to unnecessary
investigations during the terminal phase of their illness (Morrison
2000a; Mitchell 2009), and have less analgesia prescribed in the
last six months of life compared to people without a cognitive im-
pairment (Morrison 2000b). Failure to recognise and treat pain
in dementia is widespread and the risk increases with increased
severity of the disease (Scherder 2005). There is also evidence of a
high prevalence of antimicrobial treatment in nursing home res-
idents with advanced dementia (Di Giulio 2008; Givens 2010),
including evidence that antimicrobial treatment intensifies signifi-
cantly as people approach death (D’Agata 2008). Thus, usual care
of people with advanced dementia is not universally underpinned
by a palliative approach.
There are important differences between dementia and other ter-
minal diseases. In dementia, prognosis is less predictable and the
trajectory of the disease varies: without a comorbidity, the mean
time from diagnosis to death depends strongly on age at diagno-
sis, varying from 8.3 years for people diagnosed aged 65 to 70
years to 3.4 years for people diagnosed in their 90s (Brookmeyer
2002). Shuster reported that advanced dementia can last two to
three years (Shuster 2000), but even for people with advanced de-
mentia, estimating prognosis is still difficult. Medical and nursing
home staff overestimate prognosis in advanced dementia (Mitchell
2004), and proposed mortality risk models provide, at best, only
modest accuracy in predicting six-month survival (Mitchell 2009;
Mitchell 2012).
One systematic review concluded that there was a need to iden-
tify reliable, sensitive and specific prognosticators of mortality in
advanced dementia (Brown 2012). Unlike other leading causes of
death, advanced dementia is characterised by persistently severe
disability during the last year of life (Gill 2010). In addition, the
diagnosis and evaluation of pain is more difficult due to challenges
communicating with the person with advanced dementia. Peo-
ple with advanced dementia are not always able to express their
wishes about their own current and future care, due both to their
very limited speech and to their lack of capacity to make decisions
(Allen 2003). Thus, this adds to the complexity involved in meet-
ing current care needs and in developing an advance care plan, if
a plan is not already in place. Further, clinicians or nurses are not
always sensitive to non-verbal means of communicating pain and
distress by people with dementia (Hubbard 2002; Allan 2014).
Palliative care has focused traditionally on care for people with
cancer but for more than a decade, there have been increased calls
worldwide to extend palliative care services to include all peo-
ple with life-limiting illnesses in need of specialist care, includ-
ing people with dementia (Davies 2004; Australian Government
2006; National Council for Palliative Care 2006; Cahill 2012). In
the US, there have been some specialist hospices for people with
advanced dementia for some time (Volicer 1994), and there has
been a significant increase in the provision of hospice care for peo-
ple with dementia since the mid-2000s (Torke 2010; Alzheimer’s
Association 2014). But appropriate care is still not consistently
available across the US for people with advanced dementia (Kim
2005; Mitchell 2007).
Globally, some examples of good practice in palliative care services
for people with dementia have emerged but, overall, people with
dementia tend to die in residential care, in acute hospitals or at

2011; Ryan 2012). There is some evidence of good palliative care
practice for people with dementia in low and middle income coun-
tries (Shaji 2009), but palliative care in general is underdeveloped
in these regions (Lamas 2012).
The European Association of Palliative Care (EAPC) published a
white paper providing a definition, for the first time, of optimal
palliative care for people with dementia, based on a Delphi ex-
ercise involving experts from 23 countries (van der Steen 2014).
Palliative care is defined by the EAPC as “the active, total care of
the patients whose disease is not responsive to curative treatment.
Control of pain, of other symptoms, and of social, psychological
and spiritual problems is paramount. Palliative care is interdisci-
plinary in its approach and encompasses the patient, the family
and the community in its scope. In a sense, palliative care encap-
sulates the most basic concept of care - that of providing for the
needs of the patient wherever he or she is cared for, either at home
or in the hospital. Palliative care affirms life and regards dying as
a normal process; it neither hastens nor postpones death. It sets
out to preserve the best possible quality of life until death” (EAPC
1998).
Description of the intervention
In this review, we included and appraised interventions aimed
at improving palliative care delivered to people with advanced
dementia. Aninterventioncanimpactone ormore of the following
domains:
• the person with dementia, focusing on managing pain or on
psychological, social or spiritual dimensions of the person with
dementia;
• the family/carer, with an emphasis on carer well-being, carer
burden and bereavement support;
• the quality of care, which may include interventions such as
advance care planning, staff education programmes or the
organisation and delivery of care;
• the interventions may focus on individual components of
care, for example, pain management, or they may be multi-
component interventions aimed at changing the way care is
delivered and at improving communication between clinicians,
professional carers, the person with dementia and the family.
How the intervention might work
There is some evidence of the benefits of palliative care teams,
mainly for people with cancer (Higginson 2003; Gomes 2013),
but evidence on the effects of other palliative care interventions is
inconclusive (Candy 2012; Chan 2016). Given the complexity of
managing people with advanced dementia in the terminal stages
of their disease, we anticipated that several different types of in-
terventions could work to improve care in advanced dementia. It
is likely that the mechanism by which the interventions may work
will also vary significantly, for example:
• for the person with advanced dementia: by providing relief
from pain, avoiding unnecessary investigations, medications and
transitions, and by increasing comfort;
• for the family: by increasing their understanding of what to
expect during the dying process, by maximising communication
with healthcare professionals, by helping families cope with the
illness and bereavement, and by reducing the care burden on
family carers;
• on the organisation of care: by placing the person with
advanced dementia at the centre of the care process, by raising
the level of awareness of the needs of the person with advanced
dementia and by enhancing the communication skills of
professional carers.
Why it is important to do this review
There is an increased focus worldwide on extending palliative care
to all those in need of it, as evidenced by the 2014 white paper
from the EAPC defining optimal palliative care for people with de-
mentia (van der Steen 2014). There is a need to synthesise the evi-
dence available on interventions that improve care for people with
advanced dementia for policy makers and clinicians. The chronic
disease course of dementia gives families, carers, clinicians and,
during the early stages of the disease, the person with dementia,
the opportunity to look ahead and plan for the final stages of care.
Such decisions should be underpinned by good-quality evidence.
There is potential for some overlap between this review and the
Cochrane Review completed by Hall 2011 entitled Interventions
for improving palliative care for older people living in nursing care
homes. However, our review differs from Hall 2011 in that it fo-
cuses on people with advanced dementia in need of palliative care,
living in any setting and includes both interventions that focus on
individual components of palliative care, for example, pain man-
agement, and multi-component service interventions.

Palliative care interventions in advanced dementia (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Because of the complexity of conducting randomised controlled
trials (RCTs) with people with advanced dementia, we antici-
pated few RCTs. Therefore, we considered it necessary to include
a broader range of controlled comparison studies, to help us to
determine the effect of interventions to improve care in advanced
dementia. Therefore, we considered RCTs, trials where allocation
was truly random (e.g. random number table); non-randomised
controlled trials (nRCTs), where allocation was not truly random
(e.g. alternation), controlled before-and-after studies (CBA) and
interrupted time series (ITS) studies for inclusion in this review.
We used the criteria defined in the Cochrane Effective Practice and
Organisation of Care (EPOC) Review Group guidelines (EPOC
2013) for inclusion of CBA and ITS studies, as follows:
• CBA studies must have had at least two intervention sites
and two control sites;
• ITS studies must have had a clearly defined point in time
when the intervention occurred and at least three data points
before and three after the intervention.
Types of participants
Adults of either gender, with dementia of any type staged as ad-
vanced by a recognised and validated tool, such as stage 6d or
above on the FAST (Reisberg 1988), CDR-3 (Severe) on the Clin-
ical Dementia Rating (CDR) Scale (Hughes 1982), stage 7 on the
Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) (Reisberg 1982), or any other
validated measure. We also included studies where the participants
were informal or paid carers of people with advanced dementia.
We anticipated that there would be few studies where all partici-
pants had advanced dementia. Therefore, we decided a priori to
include studies where separate results for people with advanced
dementia were available or where more than 80% of the study
population had advanced dementia, as defined above. Participants
could be living in their own homes or with a family member, in
supported housing, in any type of long-term care facility, in a hos-
pice or in hospital.
Types of interventions
We included clinical and non-clinical interventions including one
or more of the following:
• assessment and management of physical, psychological and
spiritual symptoms of the person;
• advance care planning, including decision-aid interventions
for family carers/surrogates;
• management of transition(s) of the person with advanced
dementia from one care setting to another;
• education and training on living and dying with advanced
dementia for family members;
• education and training on advanced dementia for clinicians
and professional care staff;
• changes in the organisation of care to incorporate a
palliative approach to care for the person with advanced
dementia.
Comparison
We prespecified the following comparisons:
• palliative care interventions versus usual care or optimised
usual care;
• palliative care intervention versus another palliative care
intervention.
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
• Improvement of care. We anticipated that many different
outcomes would have been measured in studies included in this
review, using many different measurement scales. Therefore, we
reported on all outcomes used in the included studies and aimed
to categorise them using the “domains and dimensions of
outcome measures in palliative care” (Bausewein 2011). We
planned to analyse separately outcomes for the person with
advanced dementia, outcomes related to the family or carer, and
outcomes related to the quality of care. We looked for outcomes
covering both beneficial effects and adverse events. We did not
exclude studies on the basis of the outcomes measured.

Data collection and analysis
We developed the methods used in this Cochrane Review in ac-
cordance with recommendations described in the Cochrane Hand-
book for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011).
Selection of studies
After merging search results and discarding duplicates, two review
authors (EM, SC) independently screened the titles and abstracts
of all identified citations to identify potential studies. We classified
the citations into three groups: ’exclude’, ’potentially relevant’ or
’unsure’. We excluded papers classified by both review authors as
’exclude’.
We retrieved the full-text versions of all ’potentially relevant’ and
’unsure’ citations for definitive assessment of eligibility. We ob-
tained sufficient translations of non-English citations to allow us
to judge whether to include or exclude the studies. For conference
abstracts, we searched for related publications, and, when unable
to find any, we contacted the study authors to see whether any
further unpublished data were available. Two review authors (EM,
SC) independently screened the full texts for a comprehensive as-
sessment against the inclusion criteria. We resolved any disagree-
ments through discussion, and when required, we consulted with
all the review team. We used EndNote software to manage cita-
tions.
Data extraction and management
We designed and tested a data extraction form. Where possible,
we obtained the following information for each included study:
• data on the inclusion criteria for the original intervention
(study design; setting, including the country; details on the place
of residence of participants; types of participants; type of
intervention; type of comparator, outcomes measured);
• number of participants eligible, number randomised and
reasons for not including eligible participants in the study,
including both the person with dementia and carers;
• length of follow-up, number of follow-up points;
• participant characteristics, including details on diagnosis,
how severity was staged and, where appropriate, details of
comorbidity/comorbidities;
• carer/family member characteristics, including involvement
in delivering care to the person with advanced dementia;
• details about the intervention (components, length, mode
of delivery, materials given to participants, providers, level of
contact with family, etc.), comparison (including definition of
usual care);
• data to assess the risk of bias of the original trial
(randomisation; blinding of participants and personnel;
description of dropouts, withdrawals and missing data; details on
possible contamination between control and intervention
groups; and selective outcome reporting);
• baseline and end of intervention data on outcomes of
interest for the review, scales used to measure outcomes.
Two review authors (EM, SC) extracted data using the agreed form
and resolved discrepancies through discussion. We had planned to
consult with another review author if required to reach agreement
but this was not necessary. When information regarding any data
were missing, unclear or incomplete, we attempted to contact
authorsof the original reportstorequestfurtherdetails. We entered
data in duplicate into Review Manager 5 (RevMan 2014), and
checked for accuracy. When information regarding any data was
missing, unclear or incomplete, we attempted to contact authors
of the original reports to request further details.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors (EM and DD) independently assessed risk
of bias for each included study. We used the Cochrane tool for
assessing risk of bias (Table 8.4.a, Higgins 2011). We had planned
to use additional guidance from the Cochrane EPOC group for
CBAs and ITS studies (EPOC 2013), but this was not necessary as
both included studies were RCTs. We resolved any disagreements
by discussion and did not need to consult a third review author.
The risk of bias assessors knew the identity of the publication and
the author information for each study. We attempted to contact
study authors for clarification where the methodology was not
clearly described in the study report.
We considered selection bias and reporting bias across each study.
We planned to report performance bias, detection bias and attri-
tion bias for each outcome (e.g. mortality) or class of outcomes
(e.g. subjective outcomes). However, because all outcomes re-
ported in this review required a degree of subjective assessment,
we reported risk of bias only by group (class of outcome).
Selection bias: random sequence generation
We assessed the risk that the random sequence generation method
used did not produce comparable groups, scoring selection bias
thus:
• for RCTs, if the sequence generation process was clearly
random (e.g. use of random number table): low risk;
• for RCTs, if the sequence generation process was not
specified in the paper and not available from the authors: unclear
risk;
• for nRCTs, CBA studies and ITS studies: high risk (but
both included studies were RCTs).

 Selection bias: allocation concealment
We assessed the risk that the intervention allocation could have
been foreseen (was not concealed adequately) in advance of or
during recruitment or could have been changed after assignment
of participants to intervention groups. We scored selection bias
thus:
• if sealed opaque envelopes were used, if randomisation and
allocation was performed on all participants or units at the same
time after recruitment was completed, if a person outside the
study team was responsible for revealing the allocation or if some
central allocation process was used (e.g. central telephone
contact): low risk;
• any inadequate concealment of allocation (e.g. allocation
list available to researchers before recruitment of some
participants): high risk;
• if the allocation concealment process was not specified in
the paper and not available from the authors: unclear risk;
• for nRCTs, CBA studies and ITS studies: high risk (but
both included studies were RCTs).
Performance bias: blinding participants and personnel
Given the nature of many palliative interventions, it is not pos-
sible to blind participants and study personnel to the interven-
tions. However, we described the methods used, if any, to blind
participants, including family members, and study personnel to
the intervention and scored selection bias thus:
• for all outcomes, if participants and study personnel were
blinded or if we judged that the lack of blinding was unlikely to
impact results: low risk;
• when we considered lack of blinding of participants and
study personnel was likely to impact a given outcome: high risk;
• when it was not clear whether lack of blinding of
participants and study personnel impacted a particular outcome:
unclear risk.
Detection bias: blinding of outcome assessors
We attemptedtoascertainwhetheroutcome assessorswere blinded
to the intervention and scored detection bias thus:
• for all outcomes assessed blindly: low risk;
• for objective outcomes (e.g. mortality), where outcome
assessors were not blinded: low risk;
• for subjective outcomes (e.g. pain), where outcome
assessors were not blinded: high risk;
• if it was not clear whether outcome assessors were blinded
for an outcome that we considered would be impacted by lack of
blinding: unclear risk.
Attrition bias: incomplete outcome data
We explored whether dropouts and withdrawals, and reasons why
they occurred, were reported, with a particular focus on estab-
lishing if missing data were balanced across groups and we scored
attrition bias thus:
• if less than 20% of data were missing, and missing data
were balanced across groups: low risk;
• if either more than 20% of data were missing or missing
data were not balanced across groups: high risk;
• if the percentage of missing data were not clear or it was
unclear whether the missing data were equally divided across
groups: unclear risk.
Reporting bias
We compared the outcomes reported in the Results section of the
studypublicationswith the outcomeslisted in the Methods section
of the paper reporting the findings and the study protocol (where
available) to identify any selective outcome reporting and scored
the risk of reporting bias thus:
• if it was clear that all prespecified outcomes and all key
expected outcomes were reported: low risk;
• if all the study’s prespecified outcomes were not reported or
if one or more of the reported primary outcomes were not
prespecified: high risk;
• if outcomes of interest were not reported completely or if a
key outcome that one would expect to have been reported was
not reported: high risk;
• if there was doubt whether the outcomes reported included
all outcomes measured: unclear risk.
Other potential sources of bias
We examined the study reports for other potential sources of bias
(e.g. the risk of contamination of controls), and scored the risk of
bias from other sources thus:
• study appeared to be free of other sources of bias: low risk;
• there was at least one other important risk of bias (e.g.
extreme baseline imbalance not adjusted for in analysis or
contamination of controls): high risk;
• if there was insufficient information to assess whether
another important source of bias existed or if there was not
sufficient evidence that an identified problem would introduce
bias: unclear risk.
For cluster RCTs, we assessed these additional sources of bias (Sec-
tion 16.3.2, Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interven-
tions, Higgins 2011):
• recruitment bias (e.g. were people recruited after clusters
were randomised or were inclusion/exclusion criteria applied
differently in different arms?);
• baseline imbalance between the clusters;
• incorrect analysis - was there evidence of adjustment in
analysis for cluster effect?
For each of these sources, we rated the risk of bias as follows:
10
Palliative care interventions in advanced dementia (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 • if there was clear evidence that no risk of bias was
introduced: low risk;
• if there was evidence of a problem and no adjustment had
been made in the analysis to counteract it: high risk;
• if insufficient information was available to make a decision
on the risk of bias from a specific source: unclear risk.
Summary of risk of bias
All outcomes reported in the ’Summary of findings’ table required
a degree of subjective assessment. Therefore, we considered that
all outcomes were subjective and assessed the overall risk of bias
for all outcomes as a group, as follows (guided by Table 8.7.a in
Higgins 2011):
• if most information was from studies at low risk of bias: low
risk;
• if the proportion of information from studies at high risk of
bias was sufficient to affect the interpretation of the results: high
risk;
• if most information was from studies at low or unclear risk
of bias: unclear risk.
At an individual study level, we rated studies as high quality when
they were at low risk of bias for allocation concealment and in-
complete outcome data. Finally, we incorporated the results of the
risk of bias assessment into the review through systematic narrative
description and commentary. We did not conduct a meta-analy-
sis, therefore, were unable to explore the effect of the risk of bias
through a sensitivity analysis based on trial quality, as planned.
Additional detail on methods of analysis for ’Risk of bias’ assess-
ment that could be used in future updates of this review, should a
meta-analysis of data be possible, are available in the protocol for
this review (Murphy 2015).
Measures of treatment effect
For dichotomous data, we planned to present results as summary
risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continu-
ous data, we planned to use the mean difference (MD) with 95%
CIs where outcomes were measured using the same scale or in the
same way in the included studies. We planned to use change-from-
baseline data, or, if these were not available, final value scores.
We planned to use the standardised mean difference (SMD) with
95% CIs if studies measured the same outcomes but use different
measurement scales (Higgins 2011).
Additional details on methods to address unit of analysis issues,
assessment of heterogeneity, assessment of reporting bias, data syn-
thesis, and subgroup and sensitivity analysis that could be used in
updates of this review, should a meta-analysis of data be possible,
are available in the protocol for this review (Murphy 2015).
Dealing with missing data
Where data were missing from published reports, we contacted
study authors to request data for included studies. For included
studies, we noted the level of attrition, per group, and per outcome
or group of outcomes.
Data synthesis
We planned to use Review Manager (RevMan) to conduct statis-
tical analysis; however, the included studies were too disparate in
terms of interventions, settings and outcomes to allow pooling of
results in a meta-analysis, so we described the results of the trials
using a narrative summary.
Summarising and interpreting results
We used the GRADE system to assess the certainty of evidence
behind each outcome, taking account of risk of bias in the con-
tributing studies, imprecision of the effect estimate, inconsistency
between studies, indirectness of the evidence and possible publi-
cation bias (Guyatt 2008). For each comparison, we constructed
a ’Summary of findings’ table that was an adaptation of that pro-
ducedfromthe GRADEDevelopmentTool software (GRADEpro
2014). To identify the seven most important outcomes for inclu-
sion in the ’Summary of findings’ table, we conducted a priority-
setting exercise. An online survey listed all the outcomes measured
in the included studies and each author on the review team in-
dependently ranked the five outcomes (out of the 31 outcomes
measured in the included studies) they considered the most im-
portant. From this process, we identified the top seven outcomes
for inclusion in the ’Summary of findings’ table as:
• palliative care plan adopted during an acute hospital
admission;
• palliative care plan available on discharge from an acute
hospital;
• decisional conflict in family/informal carers;
• discussions on feeding with a physician/nurse/physician
assistant;
• palliative care plan developed during hospitalisation;
• decision to forgo cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in
hospital;
• death in an acute hospital.

 Results of the search
We identified 1648 citations with potential for inclusion from
our initial electronic search in January 2015 and five citations
from other sources. A second search in February 2016 identified
a further 157 citations (see Figure 1). After removing duplicates,
we screened the titles and abstracts of 1535 citations and excluded
1457 citations. We reviewed the full text of the remaining 78
citations for a more detailed evaluation. We contacted authors of
13studiestoclarifymethodological queries, 11authorsresponded,
one of whom re-analysed data for the purposes of this review
(Hanson 2011). Of the full-text studies reviewed, two studies,
each reported in two citations, met our inclusion criteria and were
included in the review: one individually randomised controlled
trial (Ahronheim 2000) and one cluster RCT (Hanson 2011). We
identified no completed quasi-randomised studies, CBAs or ITS.

 Included studies
The individually randomised controlled trial involved 99 partici-
pants with advanced dementia (Ahronheim 2000) and the cluster
RCT included 256 dyads, where each person with advanced de-
mentia was recruited with a surrogate decision-maker; 90 dyads in
the study population met the advanced dementia criteria of this
review (Hanson 2011).
Participants and settings
The Ahronheim study included people with advanced dementia,
staged as FAST 6d-7f, hospitalised for an acute illness (Ahronheim
2000). It was conducted at one acute hospital in the US. The Han-
son study included nursing home residents with advanced demen-
tia, staged as GDS 6 or 7, and feeding problems; each resident was
enrolled with a surrogate decision maker, defined as the resident’s
guardian, Health Care Power of Attorney, or the primary family
contact and most likely to be involved in clinical decision making
(Hanson 2011). Of the 256 dyads in the study, 90 residents were
staged as GDS 7, thus meeting the criteria for inclusion in this
systematic review, and the authors re-analysed the data for this
subset of participants for the purposes of this review. The study
was conducted in 24 nursing homes in the US.
Characteristics of the interventions
The Ahronheim study measured the effectiveness of a palliative
care team established at the acute hospital, consisting of a clinical
nurse specialist and one or more attending geriatrician(s), who
also held academic appointments (Ahronheim 2000). The pallia-
tive care team visited each person and discussed their management
with the primary healthcare team in the hospital on a daily basis
during admission, making recommendations with the goal of en-
hancing each person’s comfort. The palliative care team also dis-
cussed participant care with surrogates when possible, in person
or by telephone. The control group were treated by the primary
care team without the input of the palliative care team.
The Hanson study tested whether a decision aid for surrogates
of nursing home residents with advanced dementia improved the
quality of decision-making about feeding options (Hanson 2011).
Surrogates received a structured decision aid providing informa-
tion about dementia; feeding options, including feeding for com-
fort near the end of life; and the outcomes, advantages and disad-
vantages of feeding tubes and assisted oral feeding. The decision
aid also discussed the surrogate’s role in decision making and the
surrogates were encouraged to discuss the decision aid with health-
care providers. Control surrogates received usual care, including
any information typically provided by healthcare providers.
Outcome measures
In the Ahronheim study, outcomes reported included the total
and the mean number of admissions, the number of deaths in
hospital, the existence of a palliative care plan, with a breakdown
on the number of decisions recorded to forgo each of seven life-
sustaining treatments, details on the use of nine life-sustaining
interventions during admissions and details on the use of four
procedures (feeding tubes, mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy
and CPR) (Ahronheim 2000). The outcomes measured in this
study focused on the process of care, rather than on the outcomes
for the participant or the family/carer.
The primary outcome in the Hanson study was decisional conflict
of the surrogate at three months (Hanson 2011), measured using
the validated Decisional Conflict Scale (O’Connor 1995). Sec-
ondary outcomes included knowledge about dementia and feed-
ing options, frequency of feeding discussions between surrogate
and care providers and the use of assisted feeding treatments. The
primary outcome in this study focused on the family/carer, the
secondary outcomes focused mainly on the process of care.
In total, the two studies measured 31 different outcomes and no
outcome was measured in both studies.
Excluded studies
We excluded 74 citations at full-text stage: 29 did not describe a
palliative intervention, 18 did not meet study design criteria, 19
either did not include participants with advanced dementia or less
than 80% of the participants had advanced dementia and results
were not available separately for those with advanced dementia,
and one study included participants with dementia but the sever-
ity of dementia was not staged by a validated functional scale. The
Characteristics of excluded studies table lists details of studies ex-
cluded at full-text stage.
In addition, there were seven citations reporting on six ongo-
ing studies meeting the inclusion criteria for this review; data
collection was complete in four studies with analysis underway
but results not yet available when this review was drafted (Agar
2015; Boogaard 2013; Einterz 2014; Arcand 2015), and data col-
lection was ongoing in the other two studies (NCT01774799;
NCT02211287).
Risk of bias in included studies
For risk of bias assessment (see Characteristics of included studies
table), we grouped all outcomes reported in each included study
into one group, subjective outcomes, as the measurement of all
outcomes was open to some subjectivity. In the Ahronheim study,
we judged risk of performance bias as high, and we judged the risk
of selection bias as unclear. We also considered there was a high
14

 risk of contamination bias as intervention and control participants
were managed by the same medical team. We judged the risk of
detection, attrition and reporting bias as low (Ahronheim 2000).
In the Hanson study, we judged the risk of recruitment bias, per-
formance bias and detection bias as high. We judged the risk of
selection bias, reporting bias, attrition bias and other biases as low
(Hanson 2011). Figure 2 summarises the risk of bias assessment
for both studies.

 Effects of interventions
See: Summary of findings for the main comparison Palliative
care team in acute hospital; Summary of findings 2 Structured
decision aid on feeding options
We did not pool data due to the heterogeneity between the two
trials in terms of the interventions, the outcomes and the times at
which the outcomes were measured. For the same reasons, we did
not perform subgroup or sensitivity analyses. Instead, the results
of the two trials are presented separately.
Ahronheim 2000 provided data on the impact of a palliative care
team in an acute hospital. Because the data were from a single study
with a small sample size, event rates were low for some outcomes,
and there was a high risk of performance bias and contamination
bias, we judged the certainty of evidence behind all effectestimates
as very low (downgraded due to very serious risk of bias for all
outcomes, and downgraded for either or both of inconsistency and
imprecision, depending on the outcome).
Drawing on data from one study only (Ahronheim 2000), there
was evidence that participants allocated to a palliative care team
were more likely to have a palliative care plan developed during
hospitalisation than participants in the control group (RR 5.84,
95% CI 1.37 to 25.02; 1 trial, 99 participants; Analysis 1.1). Only
two participants, both in the intervention group, had a palliative
care plan used during hospitalisation, hence we could not draw
conclusions about the effect of the intervention on this outcome.
The palliative care plan was usually not available until discharge
and availability on discharge was more likely in the intervention
group (RR 4.50, 95% CI 1.03 to 19.75; 1 trial, 99 participants;
Analysis 1.1).
There was no difference in mortality in hospital between partici-
pants allocated to the palliative care team and participants receiv-
ing usual care (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.13; 1 trial, 99 partici-
pants; Analysis 1.2). There was no difference in the mean number
of hospital admissions per participant between the groups (MD
0.04, 95% CI -0.74 to 0.82; Analysis 1.3).
Data reported suggest that the intervention had no impact on de-
cisions to forgo CPR in hospital or on discharge. Only a small
number of decisions were made to forgo treatments other than
CPR. There was little use of mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy
or CPR in either group. The study reported that participants in
the intervention group were less likely to have intravenous therapy
during admission, but there was no impact on the use of other life-
sustaining treatments, including systemic antibiotics, daily phle-
botomy or the number of new feeding tubes inserted. However,
data on decisions to forgo CPR and the use of life-sustaining treat-
ments are reported based on the number of admissions rather than
the number of participants, thus the effect sizes are more precise
than they should be and therefore are not reported here.
One study reported the effect of a decision aid for surrogate de-
cision-makers of nursing home residents with advanced demen-
tia (Hanson 2011). For the purposes of this review, the authors
re-analysed the data for 90 study dyads with advanced dementia
staged as GDS 7 (35% of total study population), the participant
inclusion criterion for the review. Because the data were drawn
from a reanalysis of a small subgroup from a single study and the
risk of recruitment, performance and detection biases were high,
we judged the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes as very
low (downgraded due to very serious risk of bias and serious in-
consistency).
In this subset, the intervention surrogate decision-makers had
lower total scores on the Decisional Conflict Scale (MD -0.30,
95% CI -0.61 to 0.01; 1 trial, 90 participants; Analysis 2.1)
and were more likely than controls to discuss feeding options
with a physician, nurse practitioner or physician assistant (RR
1.57, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.64; Analysis 2.2), although in both out-
comes the CIs included no difference. A change of 0.3 to 0.4 on
the Decisional Conflict Scale is considered a meaningful change
(O’Connor 1993).
Participantswhose surrogate decision-makersreceivedthe decision
aid intervention were more likely to receive a modified diet (RR
1.19, 95% CI 0.31 to 4.54; 1 trial, 90 participants; Analysis 2.3)
and were more likely to be on a specialised dysphagia diet (RR
1.30, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.56; Analysis 2.3). The intervention had
no impact on the use of other assisted oral feeding techniques.
No surrogates in either group had made an explicit choice for or
against a feeding tube at three months.

Summary of main results
The primary aim of this review was to assess the effect of palliative
care interventions in advanced dementia. We included two trials.
Although the populations in the two included studies were similar,
differences between the interventions and the outcomes measured
meant that it was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis, that is, to
pool data meaningfully across the two studies. One study assessed
the effect of a palliative care team in an acute hospital (Ahronheim
2000), the other study assessed the impact of a decision aid on the
quality of decision-making about feeding options by surrogate de-
cision-makers of nursing home residents with advanced dementia
(Hanson 2011). The Hanson 2011 study required a reanalysis of
the study data to include only data pertaining to a subset of the
study population that met the inclusion criteria of this systematic
review.
While one study reported that with a palliative care team interven-
tion in acute hospitals, participants in the intervention group were
more likely to have a palliative care plan, the numbers were small
and the palliative care plan was typically not in place until dis-
charge (Ahronheim 2000). It was also less likely that intravenous
therapy was used in participants in the intervention group during
hospitalisation but the intervention did not impact the use of any
other life-sustaining treatments or procedures.
In the second study, data for the subset of participants meeting the
review definition of advanced dementia was reanalysed (Hanson
2011). From the reanalysis of this subset, we found some evidence
that a decision aid helps to reduce decisional conflict in surrogates
and leads to increased discussions between surrogates and health-
care providers on feeding options, but there was significant un-
certainty about both of these results. However, the original study,
drawing on data from the full study population, provided stronger
evidence that the intervention has a positive impact for both of
these outcomes, which gives us more confidence that there is a
true effect. The decision aid also resulted in more residents with
advanced dementia being on a specialised dysphagia diet.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
The number of included studies, the variation in the interventions
and settings of the two included studies and the fact that it was
not possible to conduct a meta-analysis of data for any outcome
provided insufficient evidence to assess the effect of palliative care
interventions in advanced dementia. The two included trials give
an indication of the range of outcomes that have been measured
to date but it is not possible to have a meaningful discussion on
outcomes based on only two trials.
The definition of advanced dementia for this review led to the
exclusion of some quality studies conducted on a more general
population of people with dementia, but our definition does re-
tain a focus on the most vulnerable people with dementia. The
latter are a particularly important group given their proximity to
death and their need for palliative interventions across a range of
activities. They are also a vulnerable group given the difficulty of
communication that occurs with advanced dementia and of being
understood by care providers even when non-verbal communica-
tion is attempted. The existing lack of data on optimal palliative
care interventions to meet the needs of this special population
highlights the importance of research focused on this population,
despite the challenges.
The fact that there are six ongoing studies at the time of this
review indicates an increased interest in this area by researchers
and possibly a recognition by ethics committees of the importance
of conducting research in vulnerable populations. There are also
signs of a growing convergence in the outcomes that are being
measured, which means that the results will be more comparable,
with potential to conduct a meta-analysis on some outcomes.
We had planned to use the Bausewein model domains and dimen-
sions of outcome measures in palliative care to report on the out-
comes measured in the included studies and to analyse separately
outcomes for the person with advanced dementia, outcomes re-
lated to family or carers and outcomes related to quality of care
(Bausewein 2011). However, due to the low number of studies
included and the diversity in outcomes measured, this was not
possible. It is worth noting that one study focused entirely on
process of care outcomes (Ahronheim 2000), while the primary
outcome in the Hanson 2011 study related to the family and the
secondary outcomes in this study focused mainly on process of
care outcomes. However, the six ongoing studies suggest that there
is a growing focus on outcomes of relevance to the person with
advanced dementia, for example, comfort in dying and comfort at
end of life, and of relevance to the family/carer, for example, sat-
isfaction with care, measured using the End-of-Life-in Dementia
(EOLD) suite of measurement tools (Volicer 2001).
Quality of the evidence
Very little high quality work has been completed exploring pal-
liative care interventions in advanced dementia. This review in-
cluded only two trials, with 189 people with advanced dementia.
A meta-analysis of the data was not possible, due to variations in
the interventions, the settings and the outcomes measured. One
study had a small sample size and the number of events was very
small. The second study required a reanalysis of a subset of the
participants in the original study to include only those participants
who met the inclusion criteria for this review, resulting in a small
sample size that was no longer powered to measure the primary
outcome. We downgraded the evidence from both studies by two
due to risk of bias and downgraded the evidence because of other
factors. Therefore, the certainty of evidence reported in this review
is very low.

 Potential biases in the review process
This review was conducted as outlined in the Cochrane Handbook
for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011); therefore,
the introduction of bias during the review process was minimised.
We are confident that the search strategy identified all relevant
studies. Some bias may have been introduced by limiting the re-
analysis of data in the Hanson 2011 study to a subset of the orig-
inal study outcomes but the reanalysis was conducted long after
study end specifically for this review.
Limitations of this review
The limitations of this work are related to the small number of
studies that met the criteria for inclusion in the review. Quite sim-
ply, there has been a dearth of work on palliative care interventions
for people with advanced dementia. There are many reasons for
so few studies, but an important consideration is the relatively low
priority given to palliative care for people with advanced demen-
tia, making it difficult to even imagine different forms of inter-
ventions, let alone implement and evaluate them. Methodologi-
cal issues in respect of randomisation and outcome measures may
have also inhibited work in this important area. This may now
be changing, given the potential publication of six new studies in
this area in the near future, making it possible to conduct more
complete reviews, including meta-analyses.

Implications for practice
Ahronheim 2000 advised targeting people with advanced demen-
tia before transfer to acute hospital to allow for discussion on goals
of care in a less urgent environment. However, there is a growing
consensus internationally that palliative care should be provided
across the full continuum of care and across a range of conditions
(Davies 2004; UK End of Life Care Strategy 2008; Cahill 2012;
WHO 2012), and people with advanced dementia are still dying
in acute hospitals in many countries (Houttekier 2010). There-
fore, we should not abandon efforts to introduce a palliative care
approach with these people when they are admitted to acute hos-
pitals, if an advance care plan is not already in place.
However, very little high quality work has been completed explor-
ing palliative care interventions in advanced dementia. We found
only two included studies for this review, with variation in the
interventions and in the settings that made it impossible to con-
duct a meta-analysis of data for any outcome. Thus, we conclude
that there is insufficient evidence to assess the effect of palliative
care interventions in advanced dementia. The fact that there are
six ongoing studies at time of this review indicates an increased
interest in this area by researchers, which is welcome and needed.
Implications for research
The results of the Hanson study suggest that it is worthwhile to
further investigate the use of the decision aids among surrogates of
people with advanced dementia (Hanson 2011). It is also evident
that high-quality studies of many different palliative care interven-
tions in all settings are required to improve palliative care delivered
to people with advanced dementia. The Ahronheim study reminds
us of the need to include the acute hospital setting (Ahronheim
2000). Because insufficient evidence is currently available, research
isrequiredtoidentifywhatthe nature of these interventionsshould
be.
Palliative care researchers face many challenges, including the vul-
nerability of the population from which study participants are re-
cruited; the difficulty in assessing the risks and benefits of par-
ticipating in the research; and issues around consent, emotional
distress and randomisation (Krouse 2004). These challenges are
exacerbated when the focus is on people with advanced dementia,
particularly related to communication, capacity and appropriate
outcome measures. Therefore, there is a need to conduct method-
ological research to develop best practice guidelines for research in
this area.
There is also a clear need for the development of a core outcome set
for palliative care for people with advanced dementia. Developing
a core outcome set will need to take account of the personhood of
people with dementia, including holistic measures that incorpo-
rate standard measures such as pain and quality of life alongside
functioning and capabilities assessment. This will, in turn, require
increased collaboration and interdisciplinary work, bringing to-
gether not just clinicians from psychiatry, geriatrics and palliative
care, but also expertise in pain management, communication (ver-
bal and non-verbal), psychology, social gerontology, health eco-
nomics and even philosophy.

Ahronheim 2000
Methods
Randomised controlled trial, randomisation at the level of the individual, conducted
over a 3-year period in 1 acute hospital in New York, US
Participants
99 participants with advanced dementia, staged as FAST 6d or greater, hospitalised for
an acute illness. 48 in intervention group, 51 in control group
Interventions
Intervention: a palliative care team was established in the hospital, consisting of an
experienced clinical nurse specialist and ≥ 1 attending geriatrician(s), who also held
academic appointments. The palliative care team conducted a palliative consultation for
each participant, visited the participant and discussed participant management with the
primary healthcare team in the hospital on a daily basis. The palliative care team also
met with family carers or other surrogates when they were available and attempted to
arrange meetings after hours or by telephone
The goal of the intervention was to enhance participant comfort. During consultation,
options discussed included:
• avoidance of non-palliative procedures
• avoidance of mechanical constraints
• administration of pain medication for painful manoeuvres, e.g. ulcer debridement
• rehabilitation methods e.g. repositioning, massage
• counselling of surrogates and care providers about participant’s rights and
surrogates responsibilities as decision makers
• alternate planning, e.g. forgoing life-sustaining treatments, discharge to hospice,
discharge with palliative care plans and avoidance of re-hospitalisation.
Control: treatment by primary care team without the input of the palliative care team
Outcomes
Number of admissions, length of stay and number of deaths in hospital
Number of non-palliative procedures and interventions
Decisions to forgo life-sustaining treatments
Decision to adopt a palliative care plan, during hospitalisation and on discharge
Notes
1 additional participant was randomised but lost to the study (discharged from the
hospital within 24 hours of randomisation) and not included in the analysis
This study was supported by grants from The Greenwall Foundation and The Kornfeld
Foundation

Allocation concealment (selection bias)
Unclear risk
“After this baseline evaluation, patients
were randomly assigned to either the inter-
vention or to the control group.”
No details given on method of allocation
concealment.
Blinding of participants and personnel
(performance bias)
All outcomes
High risk
Given the nature of the intervention, there
was no blinding of participants or person-
nel. We judged the risk of bias due to this
lack of blinding to be high for all subjec-
tive outcomes, as the primary care team
may have made different decisions know-
ing whether a participant was in the inter-
vention or control group
Blinding of outcome assessment (detection
bias)
All outcomes
Low risk
“A research assistant blinded to randomiza-
tion status gathered information from the
charts of patients in both arms of the study.
”
Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)
All outcomes
Low risk
“One patient was discharged in the first
24 hrs [hours] after randomization and was
not readmitted, and was excluded from
analysis.”
Selective reporting (reporting bias)
Low risk
All outcomes listed in the Methods section,
with the exception of one (do not resusci-
tate), were reported in the Results
Recruitment bias (cluster trials only)
Low risk
Other bias
High risk
Potential contamination of control partici-
pants, who were being treated by the same
primary care team that were receiving in-
put from the palliative care team for the in-
tervention participants
Hanson 2011
Methods
Cluster randomised controlled trial, in 24 nursing homes in the US, randomisation at
the nursing home level, with enrolment over a 2-year period
Participants
In total, 256 dyads of a resident with advanced dementia and feeding problems and their
surrogate were enrolled in the study, 127 in intervention group, 129 in control group.
Of these, 90 dyads included a resident with advanced dementia staged as GDS 7 and
their surrogate, 46 in intervention group, 44 in control group

Interventions
Intervention: surrogates received a structured decision aid (printed or audio version) pro-
viding information about dementia and feeding options, including feeding for comfort
near the end of life, and the outcomes, advantages and disadvantages of feeding tubes or
assisted oral feeding. The decision aid also discussed the surrogate’s role in decision mak-
ing. Surrogates reviewed the decision aid during their enrolment interview and received
the printed decision aid to take home. Research assistants prompted the surrogates to
discuss the decision aid with healthcare providers
Control: surrogates received usual care, including any information typically provided by
healthcare providers
Outcomes
For all study participants:
Primary outcome: decisional conflict at 3 months, measured by the Decisional Conflict
Scale (O’Connor 1995)
Secondary outcomes (at 3 months): surrogate knowledge about dementia and feeding
options, surrogate-reported frequency of feeding discussions between surrogate and care
provider, and feeding treatment use
Secondary outcomes (at 9 months): use of new feeding tubes, number of ’do not tube
feed’ orders, weight loss and mortality
Outcomes included in re-analysis of subset of participants meeting the inclusion
criteria of this review (as requested by review team):
Primary outcome: decisional conflict at 3 months, measured by the Decisional Conflict
Scale (O’Connor 1995)
Secondary outcomes: frequency of feeding discussions between surrogate and care
providers and the use of assisted feeding treatments
Notes
90/256 (35%) participants had advanced dementia as defined for this systematic review
(staged at GDS 7). The study team reran the analysis to produce data for this subset of
the study population for this review

Risk of bias
Bias
Authors’ judgement
Support for judgement
Random sequence generation (selection
bias)
Low risk
“Nursing homes were randomized in pairs
matched on variable associated with tube
feeding rates… Paired nursing homes were
assigned to intervention or control con-
ditions by computerized random number
generation conducted by a single investiga-
tor (JG).”
Allocation concealment (selection bias)
Low risk
“Randomization was completed and allo-
cation concealed prior to enrolment.”
Blinding of participants and personnel
(performance bias)
All outcomes

rect health care providers were told the
general purpose of the study but did not
know specifically what the outcome mea-
sures were.”
It was not possible to blind surrogates to
the intervention.
Blinding of outcome assessment (detection
bias)
All outcomes
High risk
“Due to cluster randomization, data collec-
tors were not blinded to group assignment.
”
We judged this lack of blinding to be a high
risk of bias for all outcomes
Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)
All outcomes
Low risk
Numbers lost to 3-month follow-up in
both groups was low (5% and 13%)
Selective reporting (reporting bias)
Low risk
All outcomes listed in the Methods section
were reported and there was no evidence of
selective outcome reporting
Recruitment bias (cluster trials only)
High risk
Because of the nature of the intervention,
nursing homes were randomised before re-
cruitment of all participants and surrogate
dyads
Other bias
Low risk
Baseline imbalance between clusters and
cluster effects both accounted for in analy-

We did not conduct a meta-analysis, therefore were unable to explore the effect of the risk of bias through a sensitivity analysis based
on trial quality, as planned. Additional detail on methods of analysis for risk of bias assessment that could be used in future updates
of this review, should a meta-analysis of data be possible, are available in the protocol for this review. Additional detail on methods to
address unit of analysis issues, assessment of heterogeneity, assessment of reporting bias, data synthesis, and subgroup and sensitivity
analysis that could be used in future updates of this review, should a meta-analysis of data be possible, are also available in the protocol
for this review.
