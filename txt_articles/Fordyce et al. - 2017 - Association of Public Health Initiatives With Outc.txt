IMPORTANCE Little is known about the influence of comprehensive public health initiatives
according to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) location, particularly at home, where
resuscitation efforts and outcomes have historically been poor.
OBJECTIVE To describe temporal trends in bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)
and first-responder defibrillation for OHCAs stratified by home vs public location and their
association with survival and neurological outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This observational study reviewed 8269 patients with
OHCAs (5602 [67.7%] at home and 2667 [32.3%] in public) for whom resuscitation was
attempted using data from the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES) from
January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2014. The setting was 16 counties in North Carolina.
EXPOSURES Patients were stratified by home vs public OHCA. Public health initiatives to
improve bystander and first-responder interventions included training members of the
general population in CPR and in the use of automated external defibrillators, teaching first
responders about team-based CPR (eg, automated external defibrillator use and
high-performance CPR), and instructing dispatch centers on recognition of cardiac arrest.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Association of resuscitation efforts with survival and
neurological outcomes from 2010 through 2014.
RESULTS Among home OHCA patients (n = 5602), the median age was 64 years, and 62.2%
were male; among public OHCA patients (n = 2667), the median age was 68 years, and 61.5%
were male. After comprehensive public health initiatives, the proportion of patients receiving
bystander CPR increased at home (from 28.3% [275 of 973] to 41.3% [498 of 1206], P < .001)
and in public (from 61.0% [275 of 451] to 70.5% [424 of 601], P = .01), while first-responder
defibrillation increased at home (from 42.2% [132 of 313] to 50.8% [212 of 417], P = .02) but
not significantly in public (from 33.1% [58 of 175] to 37.8% [93 of 246], P = .17). Survival to
discharge improved for arrests at home (from 5.7% [60 of 1057] to 8.1% [100 of 1238],
P = .047) and in public (from 10.8% [50 of 464] to 16.2% [98 of 604], P = .04). Compared
with emergency medical services–initiated CPR and resuscitation, patients with home OHCA
were significantly more likely to survive to hospital discharge if they received
bystander-initiated CPR and first-responder defibrillation (odds ratio, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.01-2.38).
Patients with arrests in public were most likely to survive if they received both
bystander-initiated CPR and defibrillation (odds ratio, 4.33; 95% CI, 2.11-8.87).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE After coordinated and comprehensive public health
initiatives, more patients received bystander CPR and first-responder defibrillation at home
and in public, which was associated with improved survival.

lmost 400 000 Americans experience out-of-hospital
cardiac arrest (OHCA) annually,1 but less than 10% of
themsurvivetohospitaldischarge.Althoughupto80%
of all OHCAs occur at home, those who experience an at-
home OHCA have a 4 to 5 times lower chance of survival vs
those who experience an OHCA in public locations.2-6 Poorer
outcomes may be related to differences in patient character-
istics (eg, greater comorbidities), longer delay of cardiopul-
monary resuscitation (CPR) initiation and emergency medi-
calservices(EMS)arrival,higherprobabilityofanunwitnessed
arrest, and lower frequency of shockable initial rhythms.2-4,7
In 2015, the Institute of Medicine,8 supported by the Ameri-
can Heart Association,9 called for more research focusing on
the location of cardiac arrest in recognition of the knowledge
gaps and poor outcomes for at-home OHCA.
Little is known about the influence of public health initia-
tives, including widespread training of laypersons in CPR and
first responders in high-performance CPR and automated ex-
ternal defibrillator (AED) use, to improve bystander and first-
responder resuscitation efforts in patients who experience at-
home cardiac arrest. In fact, there are concerns that expanded
CPR training may not correct the large fraction of cardiac ar-
rests that occur at home.10 Studies11-15 have demonstrated that
community education and quality improvement programs to
increase bystander and first-responder intervention, includ-
ing CPR and defibrillation, and access to AEDs are associated
with improved outcomes, including survival. However, a re-
cent Danish study16 found that public health initiatives in-
creasedbystanderAEDuseinpublicbutnotinresidentialareas.
The North Carolina Regional Approach to Cardiovascular
Emergencies Cardiac Arrest Resuscitation System (RACE
CARS) program initiated multicomponent interventions to
improve OHCA care in 2010; it improved care processes and
led to a greater likelihood of survival.12 Interventions
included community training in chest compression–only
CPR, providing emergency medical dispatcher training on
early recognition of cardiac arrest and instructing bystanders
to provide CPR, first-responder training in team-based CPR,
and several in-hospital interventions, among others.
We aimed to describe temporal trends in bystander CPR
and first-responder defibrillation stratified by OHCA location
at home (private home or residence) or in public. Their asso-
ciations with survival and neurological outcomes in North
CarolinabetweenJanuary1,2010,andDecember31,2014,were
investigated.
Methods
Data Source
The Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES)17 is
a voluntary, prospective clinical registry of patients with OHCA
in the United States. All patients with a confirmed nontrau-
matic OHCA (defined as apneic and unresponsive) for whom
resuscitation by bystanders, first responders, or EMS person-
nel is attempted are included in the registry. Furthermore,
those with termination of resuscitation before hospital ar-
rival are included. Standardized international Utstein18 defi-
nitions for clinical variables and outcomes are used to encour-
age reporting uniformity. In North Carolina, a team of data
consultants (including C.T.) assisted with training, quality con-
trol, and data feedback to county EMS agencies to ensure that
the collected CARES data were of high quality. The Duke Uni-
versity Medical Center Institutional Review Board approved
this study research as minimal risk.
Study Population and Setting
To reduce the chance that our results were driven by changes
in reporting, we included only North Carolina counties with
complete registry enrollment from 2010 through 2014. There-
fore, the study population included all nontraumatic OHCAs
from 16 counties in North Carolina (Alexander, Alleghany,
Brunswick, Camden, Catawba, Durham, Forsyth, Mecklen-
burg, Pasquotank, Stanly, Stokes, Surry, Transylvania, Wake,
Warren, and Yadkin), comprising a total population of approxi-
mately 3.3 million inhabitants in 2014 (one-third of the state’
s
total population),19 with demographics varying from urban to
rural areas, served by 16 EMS agencies.12,20 The remaining 54
counties reporting data to CARES did not have complete
countywide registry enrollment for the study years and were
excluded from this analysis because temporal trends could not
be accurately calculated. We included arrests of presumed car-
diac cause and excluded cases witnessed by EMS or with do-
not-resuscitate orders, following Utstein18 guidelines. Our
study population of 8269 patients (see the Study Population
subsection of the Results section for the cohort derivation) in-
cluded 4291 individuals from a prior analysis12 describing
trends in prehospital interventions and outcomes from 2010
through 2013 with the addition of 5 counties and a subse-
quent calendar year (2014). An arrest was presumed to be of
cardiac etiology unless it was known or likely to have been
caused by trauma, drowning, respiratory causes, electrocu-
tion, drug overdose, presumed poisoning or intoxication, as-
phyxia,exsanguinations,oranyothernoncardiaccauseasbest
determinedbyrescuers.AllincludedEMSagencieshad2-tiered

Per CARES, first responders were defined as personnel who

part of an organized medical response team but who were
Key Points
Question Do comprehensive public health initiatives improve
prehospital resuscitation efforts and outcomes for patients with
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest at home, where outcomes are
especially poor, and in public locations?
Findings Among 8269 patients, this study demonstrates that
resuscitation efforts and outcomes in those with out-of-hospital
cardiac arrest at home and in public may be improved through
coordinated, multifaceted public health initiatives targeting
multiple personnel across the cardiac arrest “chain of survival,”
including first-responder programs.
Meaning Adopting some of these public health initiatives may be
helpful for communities aiming to improve outcomes of
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, including at home.

 not the designated transporter of the patient to the hospital.
First responders included AED-equipped police officers, fire-
fighters, rescue squads, or life-saving crew members trained
to perform basic life support until the EMS team arrived and
who were called to the scene by emergency medical dispatch
centers. Bystanders were defined as persons who were pres-
ent and had intervened but had not been dispatched, follow-
ing Utstein18 guidelines. Of 16 EMS agencies, 13 had imple-
mented protocols for dispatch-assisted CPR instruction
before the study period, while 3 agencies never implemented
these protocols during the study period. Protocols for team-
based CPR22 had been implemented by 4 EMS agencies
before January 2010 and by 9 EMS agencies during the study
period.
Interventions
In 2010, the HeartRescue Project23 in North Carolina initiated
a multifaceted, statewide quality improvement program. The
project included intervention for community members, EMS
personnel, first responders, and hospital administrators and
staff. For community members, chest compression–only
training was offered at major civic events and to patients
with cardiovascular disease and their family members before
hospital discharge. School staff were trained to use AEDs,
and community grants were provided to groups to imple-
ment CPR training programs. Emergency medical dispatchers
were trained to recognize when bystanders described a car-
diac arrest and give instructions to provide CPR. First
responders were instructed in team-based CPR, including
AED use and high-performance CPR. Hospital administrators
were encouraged to establish protocols for primary percuta-
neous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST-segment elevation
myocardial infarction, targeted temperature and hypother-
mia management, and goal-directed intensive unit care,
including designated physician leadership to operationalize
post–cardiac arrest protocols, with a focus on frequent neu-
rological assessment for prognosis. The full RACE CARS pro-
tocol is available online (http://racecars.dcri.org/wp-content
/uploads/2014/08/RACE-ops-3.0.pdf).
Analysis Plan and Outcome Measures
At-home OHCAs were defined a priori as those occurring in
private homes or residences. All other OHCAs were consid-
ered public, including those occurring in nursing homes or
health care facilities (which we considered to be public due to
the greater likelihood of OHCAs being witnessed, including
by health care professionals, and because AEDs are more
likely to be found in such institutions). Main outcome vari-
ables, also defined a priori, were resuscitative efforts through
CPR, defibrillation, or both from bystanders and first
responders (including the combination of efforts between
bystanders and first responders) and patient survival to dis-
charge and favorable neurological survival (measured by
cerebral performance category [CPC] 1 or 2).24 A CPC of 1 rep-
resents full recovery or mild disability, while a CPC of 2 repre-
sents moderate disability but independence in activities of
daily living.
Statistical Analysis
Proportions were calculated for categorical data, and the me-
dians (interquartile ranges) were calculated for continuous
data. Statistical significance for differences in categorical data
was assessed using the Fisher exact test or the χ2 test. Tem-
poral trends for categorical data were assessed using the Coch-
ran-Armitage test for trend across ordered groups (by year) if
the Fisher exact test or χ2 test result was statistically signifi-
cant. Analyses regarding the combination of efforts from by-
standers, first responders, and EMS (CPR and defibrillation) in-
cluded only patients who were defibrillated before hospital
arrival. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were calculated by lo-
gistic regression analyses to examine the association be-
tween bystander and first-responder intervention and sur-
vival to discharge and favorable neurological survival for the
entirestudyperiod.Estimatesarepresentedasunadjustedand
adjusted (for age and sex). We tested for interaction of loca-
tion and time for temporal outcomes as well as for location
(home vs public) for each combination of effort. A 2-sided
P < .05 was considered statistically significant. Age and sex–
adjusted results should be interpreted in the context of a lack
of adjustment for multiple comparisons and thus are explor-
atory rather than confirmatory. All analyses were performed
using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc), Stata (ver-
sion 13.0; StataCorp LLC), and GraphPad Prism (version 7;
GraphPad Software Inc).

 Results
Study Population
Our study population included 8269 patients with OHCA from
counties with complete countywide registry enrollment after
excluding patients with noncardiac causes of arrest (n = 1431),
predetermined do-not-resuscitate orders (n = 79), or cardiac
arrestafterEMSarrival(n = 1260)(Figure1).Patientswerethen
grouped based on OHCA location at home (5602 [67.7%]) vs
in public (2667 [32.3%]). Clinical characteristics for OHCAs by
location are listed in Table 1. Among home OHCA patients
(n = 5602),themedianagewas64years,and62.2%weremale;
among public OHCA patients (n = 2667), the median age was
68 years, and 61.5% were male. In general, few temporal
changes in the population were observed over the study pe-
riod at home and in public.
Trends in CPR and Defibrillation
From 2010 through 2014, rates of bystander-initiated CPR sig-
nificantlyincreasedathome(from28.3%to41.3%, P < .01)and
in public (from 61.0% to 70.5%, P = .01) (Table 2), which was
associatedwithaconcomitantdecreaseinCPRinitiatedbyfirst
responders and EMS at home and in public locations. During
the same period, rates of defibrillation by first responders sig-
nificantly increased at home (from 42.2% to 50.8%, P = .02)
but not in public (from 33.1% to 37.8%, P = .17). There were no
significantdifferencesinbystanderandEMSdefibrillationover
the same period. The combined effort of bystander CPR and
first-responder defibrillation significantly increased at home
(from 14.2% to 23.4%, P = .02), with no significant difference
among patients with public OHCA (from 13.8% to 22.9%,
P = .08). No significant difference was observed for in-
creased bystander CPR and EMS defibrillation at home (from
17.8% to 21.7%, P = .06), which was significant in public (from
23.0%to27.3%,P = .049).TherateofcombinedbystanderCPR
and bystander defibrillation declined significantly over time
at home (from 1.0% to 0.2%, P = .02), although the absolute
number of patients was small (n = 6). There was no signifi-
cant difference in the rate of combined bystander CPR and by-
stander defibrillation in public (from 20.7% to 19.6%, P = .10).
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation initiated by either first re-
sponders or EMS generally declined over time as bystander
CPR increased.
Postresuscitation Management
Over the study period, significantly fewer patients were not
declared dead in the field (from 61.3% to 50.2%, P < .01 at
home and from 69.4% to 63.0%, P = .03 in public), while
more patients were admitted to a hospital ward (from 18.5%
to 26.1%, P < .01 at home and from 22.8% to 32.2%, P < .01 in
public) (eTable in the Supplement). The proportion of
patients with at-home OHCA who were transported to a PCI
center significantly increased (from 68.6% to 78.2%, P < .01),

not seen with public OHCA for either PCI center transport
(from 79.5% to 85.4%, P = .21) or targeted temperature man-
agement (from 46.6% to 53.1%, P = .05).
Overall Trends in Survival and Favorable Neurological Survival
From 2010 through 2014, survival to hospital discharge sig-
nificantly increased both at home (from 5.7% [60 of 1057] to
8.1%[100of1238],P = .047)andinpubliclocations(from10.8%
[50 of 464] to 16.2% [98 of 604], P = .04) (Figure 2). Favor-
able neurological survival (CPC 1 or 2) significantly increased
in public (from 9.5% [44 of 464] to 14.7% [89 of 604], P = .02)
but not among patients with at-home OHCA (from 4.9% [52
of 1057] to 6.1% [76 of 1238], P = .06). We found a significant
interaction for both survival and favorable neurological sur-
vival by location (P < .05 for interaction) but not between lo-
cation and time.
Adjusted Survival and Favorable Neurological Survival
According to Who Initiated CPR and Defibrillation
After adjustment for age and sex, patients with at-home OHCA
who received bystander-initiated CPR and first-responder de-
fibrillation were the most likely to survive to hospital dis-
chargevspatientsreceivingothercombinationsofCPRandde-
fibrillation (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.01-2.38 [reference EMS CPR and
defibrillation]) (Figure 3A). Patients with public OHCA were
most likely to survive to discharge if they received both by-
stander-initiated CPR and bystander defibrillation (OR, 4.33;
95% CI, 2.11-8.87) (Figure 3B). A similar directionality favor-
ing survival was observed for patients with at-home OHCA,
who were more likely to survive to discharge with good neu-
rological function (CPC 1 or 2) if they received bystander CPR
andfirst-responderdefibrillation,althoughthisresultwasnon-
significant(OR,1.54;95%CI,0.98-2.43)(Figure3C).Thosewith
publicOHCAweresignificantlymorelikelytosurvivewithgood
neurological outcome if they received both bystander-
initiated CPR and defibrillation (OR, 4.46; 95% CI, 2.11-9.40)
(Figure 3D). We found significant interactions (P < .05) be-
tween locations for some combinations of resuscitation ef-
forts for both survival (combined bystander CPR and first-
responderdefibrillationandcombinedbystanderCPRandEMS
defibrillation) and favorable neurological survival (combined
bystander CPR and first-responder defibrillation).
Discussion
After coordinated and comprehensive public health initia-
tives, more patients received bystander CPR and first-
responder defibrillation at home and in public. This uptake of
key care processes was associated with improved survival at
home and in public, as well favorable neurological survival
among patients with public OHCA.
Although most OHCAs occur at home, historical out-
comes have been significantly worse compared with public
OHCAs.2-6 This finding has increased urgency to identify strat-
egies for improving survival among these particularly vulner-
able patients.9,12 Our data indicate that coordinated, multifac-
eted public health initiatives targeting multiple personnel
across the cardiac arrest “chain of survival,” including first-
responder programs, are associated with improved out-
comes among individuals with at-home OHCA.25 This result
occurs despite concerns that such initiatives were not previ-
ously associated with improved survival for at-home OHCA.10
A 2013 Danish study26 showed that coordinated efforts over
many years led to improved outcomes for OHCA. A national
CPR training program in Sweden11 improved CPR nationwide
and was associated with a significant overall increase in by-
stander CPR and OHCA survival. However, only 29% of pa-
tients experiencing a witnessed cardiac arrest at home re-
ceived bystander CPR compared with 50% in public. A more
recent Swedish study,27 with approximately 70% of patients
experiencing at-home OHCA, found that a mobile phone

CARS program involved more comprehensive bystander and
first-responder interventions, including AED training.
We also extend prior findings to a mixed rural and urban
population in the United States with multiple EMS agencies
and demonstrate that the combination of bystander CPR and
first-responder defibrillation at home is significantly associ-
ated with improved favorable neurological survival. Our re-
sultsarecongruentwitharecentSwedishstudy,28whichfound
thatCPRperformedbeforeEMSarrivalwasassociatedwithim-
proved 30-day survival rates after OHCA. Finally, the role of
early first-responder defibrillation for at-home OHCA may be
particularly important because AEDs are not typically avail-
able in private residences.20

 Thereareseveralpossibleexplanationswhyat-homeOHCA
carries a poorer prognosis than public OHCA. First, bystander-
initiated CPR before EMS arrival is less frequent in this
setting,8,29aswasthecaseinourstudy.At-homeOHCAismore
frequently unwitnessed or witnessed by elderly persons who
may not be trained in CPR or are incapable of performing it
effectively.30,31 While we found that bystander CPR rates were
lower at home (and associated with lower survival comapred
to public OHCA), this finding cannot be explained by age alone
because those with at-home OHCA were younger than their
public counterparts (median age, 64 vs 68 years). This result
may occur in part because we only considered private homes
(and not nursing homes) in our definition of home. Bystand-
ers at home are frequently family members or close associ-
ates, potentially with emotional barriers that could hinder re-
suscitation efforts, including concern about causing harm,32
panic,33 or fear of failure.34 Second, the incidence of shock-
able rhythms (pulseless ventricular tachycardia or ventricu-
larfibrillation)hasbeenhistoricallylowerinthehomesetting.29
We found that a shockable rhythm occurred in 21.0% (1174 of
5599) and 26.5% (706 of 2665) of at-home and public OHCAs,
respectively, which is consistent with this fact. This finding is
plausibly related to delayed EMS contact or arrival, thereby in-
creasing the likelihood that a shockable rhythm will degener-
ate to asystole,35 or may be associated with other factors, such
as concomitant comorbidities.2 Third, it is also possible that
beinginpublic(vsathome)isamarkerforbetteroverallhealth.
Therefore,improvementsinsurvivalafterpublichealthini-
tiatives for at-home OHCA are multifactorial and may be ex-
plainedbyimprovementsineachlinkinthechainofsurvival,25
including first-responder programs that decrease time to de-
fibrillation while the bystander has initiated CPR.20 Recent ini-
tiatives in Denmark resulted in a marked uptake of public but
not residential defibrillation.16 This result reinforces the im-
portance of AEDs being transported by dispatched profes-
sional first responders, which is associated with improved sur-
vival in residential areas, where AEDs are often unavailable.
Communities seeking to improve survival in residential areas
should consider implementing and measuring the influence of
dispatched first responders who can provide defibrillation be-
fore EMS arrival.
Limitations
Our study has some limitations. First, this investigation was
an observational study for which unmeasured or unmeasur-
able confounders (or secular trends) could explain improved
temporal outcomes independent of public health initiatives.
Second, our results only apply to the counties studied. How-
ever, these counties were selected based on complete
countywide registry enrollment and high accuracy of data,
including low rates of missingness, which are critical statisti-
cal considerations when describing trends. Third, these
results are mostly applicable to mixed rural and urban popu-
lations who employ first responders as part of prehospital
response to OHCA. However, the finding that first-responder
defibrillation (before EMS arrival) is associated with
improved outcomes in the home setting emphasizes the need
for early defibrillation and thus is generalizable for regions
without first responders. Fourth, our data set did not include
long-term outcomes after hospital discharge. However,
recent evidence suggests that patients who are discharged
alive after OHCA have good prognoses, which supports these
prehospital efforts.36,37 Fifth, our definition of at-home
OHCA included only private homes or residences. As such,
patient characteristics and outcomes may differ compared
with studies that used a broader definition, including resi-
dential institutions (nursing homes) or other nonpublic
locations.29 However, we were strict with our definition
because we aimed to determine whether public health inter-
ventions were associated with improvements in home loca-
tions without routine access to professionals trained in CPR,
AEDs, or other forms of defibrillation. Sixth, despite the fact
that public health initiatives improved outcomes over a
5-year period, many patients still did not receive early CPR or
defibrillation, and survival was low. This finding highlights
future opportunities to improve overall survival rates, includ-
ing for at-home OHCA.
Conclusions
In summary, we found that after public health initiatives, more
patients received bystander CPR and first-responder defibril-
lation, which was associated with increased rates of survival
at home and in public. Specifically, initiatives to improve by-
stander CPR and early defibrillation are associated with bet-
ter outcomes for OHCAs at home, where the prognosis has tra-
ditionally been poor. Adopting some of these public health
initiatives may likely be helpful for communities aiming to im-
prove outcomes of OHCA.
