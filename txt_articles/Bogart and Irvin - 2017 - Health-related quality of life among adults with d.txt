Health-related quality of life among adults
with diverse rare disorders
Kathleen R. Bogart1* and Veronica L. Irvin2
Abstract
Background: Twenty-five to 30 million Americans live with a rare disease (RD) and share challenges unique to RD.
The majority of research on RDs has focused on etiology, treatment and care, while the limited health-related
quality of life (HRQL) research has been restricted to single RDs, small samples, or non-validated measures. This
study reports HRQL among adults with diverse RDs, and compares their scores to those of the U.S. population
and people with common chronic health conditions.
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of adults living in the U.S. diagnosed with any RD. Participants
were recruited through RD organizations and completed the online survey between December 2016 and May
2017 (n = 1218). HRQL was assessed using the standardized Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information
System (PROMIS). RDs were classified into categories defined by Orphanet. Means and 95% confidence intervals were
calculated for the main sample and for RD categories and were compared to published U.S. population norms and
common chronic disease norms. Intercorrelations were conducted between HRQL, demographics, and RD experiences.
Results: When compared to the norms for the U.S. population and for those with common chronic diseases, mean
HRQL scores were significantly poorer across all six PROMIS domains for the main sample, and were usually poorer when
analyzed by sub-sets of specific RD classifications. People with rare systemic and rheumatologic, neurological, and
immune diseases had the poorest HRQL. Participants had poorer HRQL if they had multiple RDs, lower income, were
female, or older. Having symptoms longer was associated with worse HRQL, however, having a formal diagnosis longer
was associated with better HRQL.
Conclusions: This study is the first to examine HRQL in a large, heterogeneous sample of RDs using validated measures.
There is a significant disparity in HRQL among people with RD compared to the general population and people with
common chronic diseases. Poor HRQL could be attributed to challenges accessing diagnoses, medical information,
treatment, psychosocial support, and coping with stigma and uncertainty. As most individuals with RDs will not be
cured in their lifetimes, identifying ways to improve HRQL is crucial to patient-centered care and should be a funding
priority.

Background
Rare diseases and disorders (RD) are defined in the U.S.
as affecting fewer than 200,000 people per year; thus
approximately 25–30 million Americans have a RD [1].
Although there are about 7000 different RD [1], people
with diverse RDs share similar challenges [2–4]. Despite
differences in disease etiology and symptoms, many RDs
are chronic, involve multi-system dysfunction, have no
effective treatment, and require complex care [4, 5]. It is
well established that chronic diseases present challenges
to
health-related
quality
of
life
(HRQL)
[6],
an
individual’s perceived physical and mental well-being [7].
However, RDs may create additional threats to HRQL
due to poor access to information, treatment, and support
[2, 3, 8], combined with high levels of stigma [9, 10].
The experience of living with a RD often begins with a
struggle to find a diagnosis. Persons in the U.S. experi-
ence an average diagnostic delay of 7 years [11]. Once
diagnosed, people quest for doctors with expertise and

 information they can trust [3, 4, 8, 11]. For this reason,
they turn to RD organizations as their primary source of
information and support [4]. The chronic pain, fatigue,
and physical impairments associated with many RDs are
exacerbated by challenges in finding support and treat-
ment, and the fact that most RDs have no effective treat-
ment or cure [5]. The rarity of the condition may mean
that informal and formal members of one’s support sys-
tem do not know how to provide appropriate support,
or they may even question the legitimacy or severity of
the condition because it is not well understood [12]. In-
deed, two thirds of adults with RD do not receive suffi-
cient medical, informational and psychosocial support
[3, 11]. Similarly, a lack of information about one’s dis-
ease, its management, and uncertainty about prognosis
and course may result in anxiety and depression [11].
RDs are stigmatizing because they are isolating (i.e.
many people with RD never have the normalizing oppor-
tunity to meet others like themselves) [3] and other
people lack awareness, meaning people with RD are fre-
quently misunderstood, avoided, and blamed [9, 13]. So-
cial and environmental barriers like stigma limit ability
to participate in social roles and activities [13].
A few previous studies of RD HRQL have focused on
specific RDs, including systemic sclerosis/scleroderma (a
rare skin disease) [14], neurofibromatosis (a rare devel-
opmental anomaly) [15], osteogenesis imperfecta (a rare
bone disease) [16], and Huntington’s disease (a rare
neurological disease) [17], and found consistently poor
HRQL according to the Patient-Reported Outcomes
Measurement Information System (PROMIS), a meas-
urement tool developed with the U.S. National Institutes
of Health (NIH) to measure HRQL [18]. For example,
people with pulmonary fibrosis, a rare respiratory dis-
ease, were found to have high levels of depression (com-
mensurate
with
individuals
diagnosed
with
major
depression), and anxiety scores higher than individuals
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a common
respiratory disease [19].
The few RD HRQL studies have been restricted by fo-
cusing on a single, specific disease, resulting in small
samples. Given the similarities in experience across RDs
described above, examining heterogeneous RDs would
add crucial new information about commonalities and
differences in HRQL across RD types and will allow for
sufficient statistical power. Indeed, the major RD organi-
zations, which exist as umbrella organizations to support
people with all RDs, including National Organization for
Rare Disorders (NORD), Orphanet, and EURORDIS,
already consider RDs collectively when providing advo-
cacy, support, education, and funding for RDs. It is also
useful to examine HRQL across broad categories of RDs
(e.g. neurologic, neoplastic, etc.), because research fund-
ing and policy is often distributed according to these
categories (i.e. at NIH). Understanding HRQL in RDs
and RD categories can inform the support and funding
priorities provided by these organizations. As such, re-
searchers have examined RDs collectively to understand
experiences in healthcare and HRQL [8, 11]. There only
previous examination of collective RD HRQL, a report
published by Shire, which found that 86% of Americans
with a variety of RDs stated that they thought their RD
caused anxiety symptoms and 75% stated it caused de-
pression symptoms [11]. Their findings suggest that
people with diverse RDs face significant risk of HRQL
problems. However, this report surveyed only 144 adults
in the U.S. with RD and did not use validated measures
[11]. The purpose of the present study was to quantita-
tively describe HRQL among adults living in the U.S.
with a variety of RDs and RD categories using PROMIS,
and to compare their scores to those of the general
population and people with common chronic health
conditions. We predicted that participants with RD
would show worse HRQL compared to population
norms and chronic health condition norms.
Method
Study design and participants
The current project is a cross-sectional survey focused
on adults (18 or older) in the U.S. with any RD. No
complete sample frame of adults with RD in the U.S. ex-
ists. For this reason, RD organizations, the primary
source of information and support for individuals with
RD [4], were enlisted to recruit participants for this
study. NORD, the major U.S. umbrella organization for
individuals with RD and the organizations that serve
them, shared recruitment information with all 242 of its
member organizations, which in turn, distributed infor-
mation to their networks via newsletters, email, and so-
cial media. Coordination of Rare Diseases at Sanford
shared recruitment information with all adult members
of its registry (2006 individuals). Recruitment informa-
tion was also shared by other individuals and organiza-
tions through snowball sampling.
Procedure
The survey was conducted primarily online to maximize
accessibility to this geographically dispersed population.
Participants followed a link to the survey administration
website Qualtrics, an encrypted, password-protected
platform,
between December 2016 and May 2017.
Mailed paper surveys were available by request (n = 14
participants submitted a paper survey). If it was difficult
for a participant to enter responses, they were permitted
to dictate their responses to another person to enter for
them (n = 24 did so). Approximate time to complete the
survey was 40 min.

 Measures
The PROMIS Profile is comprised of independent do-
mains measuring quality of life in physical, mental, and
social health [20]. We selected six domains (i.e. anxiety,
depression, fatigue, pain interference, physical function,
and ability to participate in social roles and activities).
As discussed in the introduction, these domains are fre-
quently described in the RD HRQL literature, and we
anticipated that they would be common challenges in a
broad sample of RDs. Four-item short forms were used
for all domains. Following PROMIS scoring guidelines,
domains were scored using the published T-scores cali-
brated such that a M of 50 and an SD of 10 is represen-
tative of the U.S. general population
[18]. Higher
numbers indicate greater amounts of the domain. As
part of the PROMIS calibration sample, norms were also
published for participants with 24 common chronic dis-
eases [6]. This allows for score comparisons to the gen-
eral population as well as people with common chronic
diseases. Norms for common chronic diseases on the
ability to participate in social roles and activities scale
are not available because this scale was created after the
development of those norms.
We also examined the following demographic infor-
mation and information about experiences with RD: age,
gender, race, income, country of residence, diagnosed
RD name, number of RDs, RD name, duration of symp-
toms, and years since diagnosis.
This data was collected as part of our larger Adults
with Rare Disorder Support (AWaRDS) Study, and add-
itional measures were collected for the purposes of other
research not described here. Survey items are available
upon request.
Analysis plan
We conducted analyses using IBM SPSS Statistics 24
first on the main sample of RDs and then replicated the
analyses with a subset of participants based on their RD
categories. Variables were examined for normality using
Q-Q plots.
Main sample of RDs
In order to understand the interrelationships between
demographic factors and PROMIS scores, Pearson cor-
relation coefficients were calculated. 95% confidence in-
tervals for each PROMIS scale mean for the main
sample of RDs were calculated in order to determine
whether they differed from population norms and com-
mon chronic disease sample means. The criterion for
statistical significance was CI’s that did not include the
population or common chronic disease means (equiva-
lent to a one-sample t test). Although there has been lit-
tle research on what constitutes minimal clinically
important differences for most PROMIS subscales, 1 SD
has been suggested as a rule of thumb [15]. More spe-
cific minimal clinically important difference estimations
are available for anxiety, depression, and fatigue (0.3–0.5
SD), pain (0.4–0.6 SD), and physical function (0.2 SD)
[21, 22].
RD categories
We also compared scores for RD categories to the popu-
lation mean and common chronic disease samples. The
International Classification of Disease system is not rec-
ommended
for
RDs
[23];
instead,
Orphanet’s
linearization rules [24] and their database of categories
[25] were used to assign each RD to a single category. A
power analysis indicated that a sample of 34 was needed
to achieve 80% power with a medium effect size (d = .5),
so any category that contained more than 34 participants
was compared to the population and common chronic
disease norms by inspecting the 95% CIs.
Results
A total of 1473 participants completed the survey.
Twelve were excluded because of duplicate entries
(ascertained by duplicate email addresses). Researchers
then confirmed self-reported RDs were rare according to
the NIH definition using their Genetic and Rare Dis-
order Information Center database [26]. Eighty-one par-
ticipants were excluded because they indicated they
were undiagnosed, did not specify the name of a RD, or
their disease was not classified as rare. Although the
project was based in the U.S., 162 participants from out-
side of the U.S. responded. These were not included in
the following analyses in order to allow comparisons to
U.S. population norms. Thus, a total of 1218 participants
were included in the main sample for this study. Partici-
pant characteristics are shown in Table 1. Information
can also be gleaned from the combination of demo-
graphic information collected. The difference between
the average length of time from symptom onset to diag-
nosis (as shown in Table 1) indicates that participants in
this sample experienced a diagnostic delay of 9 years.
Calculating the difference between participant age and
length of time since diagnosis revealed that 106 partici-
pants (9%) were diagnosed with a RD before age 18.
A total of 232 RDs were represented. The 10 most
commonly endorsed RDs were: ataxia (neurologic) n =
150, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (neoplastic) n =
86, mastocytosis (neoplastic) n = 84, Ehlers-danlos syn-
drome (systemic and rheumatological) n = 75, mast cell
activation disorder (immune) n = 70, idiopathic hyper-
somnia (neurologic) n = 67, narcolepsy (neurologic) n =
63, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (neoplastic) n = 44, Bell’s
palsy (neurologic) n = 29, and erythromelalgia (neuro-
logic) n = 29. Table 2 shows the number of RDs falling
into each Orphanet classification.

 Main RD sample analyses
Table 3 shows the intercorrelations between participant
characteristics and outcome variables. For the purpose
of these correlations, due to the small number of per-
sons of color, they were grouped together to analyze race
as coded as person of color = 0, white = 1. Gender was
coded as female = 0 and male = 1. Older individuals had
less fatigue, less pain, less anxiety, less depression, and
less physical function. Females had greater fatigue, pain,
anxiety, and depression, and less ability to participate in
social roles and activities. Having symptoms of one’s RD
longer was associated with greater fatigue, pain, less abil-
ity to participate, and less physical function. However,
having one’s diagnosis longer was associated with lower
fatigue, anxiety, and depression, and better ability to par-
ticipate in social roles and activities. Having multiple
RDs was associated with greater fatigue and pain, less
ability to participate, and less physical function. Higher
income was associated with lower fatigue, pain, anxiety
and depression, and better ability to participate and
physical function.
Figure 1 shows the PROMIS M, SDs, and 95% CIs for
the main sample. Participants in the main RD sample
had
poorer
average HRQL on all PROMIS
scales
compared to population norms and common chronic
disease norms.
RD category analyses
Next, in order to analyze RD categories, it was necessary
to exclude 160 participants who selected more than one
RD from this analysis because they may fall into multiple
categories. The following five classifications met the
power requirements to be analyzed as separate RD cat-
egories:
neurologic
(n = 480),
neoplastic
(n = 221),

 systemic and rheumatological (n = 66), developmental
anomalies (n = 58), and immune (n = 56).
Figure 1 also shows that most RD categories scored
significantly worse than the population norm. The only
exception was that persons with developmental anomal-
ies did not differ from the U.S. norm on ability to par-
ticipate in social roles and activities. When comparing
RD categories to common chronic disease norms, most
RD classifications scored significantly worse. A few RD
categories did not differ from common chronic disease
norms on the following scales: 1) pain scores among per-
sons with neoplastic and developmental anomalies; 2) fa-
tigue
scores
among
persons
with
developmental
anomalies; 3) depression scores for persons with devel-
opmental anomalies and neoplastic diseases; and 4) and
physical function among persons with developmental
anomalies and neoplastic diseases.
Discussion
In the largest study of diverse RDs, we examined the
HRQL of individuals with RD in the U.S. compared
to the general population and individuals with com-
mon chronic illnesses. Findings were remarkably con-
sistent: compared to both sets of norms, our main
sample of persons with RD as a whole scored consist-
ently poorer on every subscale, and those scores were
clinically important differences for all but one scale
(ability to participate in social roles and activities). Al-
though it is well documented that individuals with
common chronic diseases experience challenges to
HRQL [6], our findings show that, as predicted, the
experience of living with RD leads to even greater
HRQL threat. RDs come with a number of unique
challenges including accessing diagnoses, medical in-
formation, treatment, psychosocial support, and cop-
ing with stigma and uncertainty [3, 9, 11].
Intercorrelations
revealed
interesting
patterns.
Women experienced poorer HRQL than men. Older
participants showed a somewhat paradoxical pattern of
poorer physical function yet lower anxiety, depression,
fatigue, and pain, which has been found in other
chronic disorders [27, 28]. This may be attributed to
the notion that physical function limitations are more
expected in older age and may result in less distress
than when the occur in younger individuals [28]. Inter-
estingly, having symptoms of one’s disease longer was
associated with poorer HRQL, but having had one’s
diagnosis for longer was associated with better HRQL.
Participants in our sample experienced long diagnostic
delays, averaging 9 years. This pattern of findings sug-
gests that, although experiencing symptoms for an ex-
tended period of time is a risk factor for poor HRQL,
receiving a diagnosis is a gateway to treatment and sup-
port that can, over time, alleviate some of the HRQL
challenges of having a RD. People navigating more than
one RD experienced poorer HRQL, suggesting that RDs
have an additive effect. People with higher income ex-
perienced better HRQL in all domains. People with
higher HRQL are more likely to be employed, generate
income, have private insurance, and access quality

 healthcare. Higher income also affords the ability to
travel greater distances to seek expert care and support.
Examining specific RD categories, participants with
systemic and rheumatic diseases had the poorest HRQL
profile, with the worst scores on every domain and
scores at least one SD worse than the norm on every
scale. Neurological diseases were also characterized by
very poor HQRL, with poor physical function, fatigue,
and ability to participate in social roles and activities (all
greater than 1 SD from the norm). Poor HRQL was also
found in immune diseases, including fatigue and pain
scores (1 SD from the norm). Participants with neoplas-
tic diseases did not show an extreme pattern of HRQL
deficits, with no scores 1 SD or greater from the norm.
Participants with developmental anomalies experi-
enced fewer HRQL deficits than the other categories. In

population mean, and gray lines indicate means for common chronic diseases. [6, 18] Higher numbers mean higher amounts of the measured
construct, so high scores on anxiety, depression, fatigue, and pain interference indicate poor HRQL, while low scores on physical function and
ability to participate in social roles and activities means poor HRQL. Main sample n = 1218; neurologic n = 480; neoplastic n = 221; systemic
and rheumatological n = 66; developmental anomalies n = 58; and immune n = 56

 fact, they did not differ from the general U.S. population
in ability to participate in social roles and activities, and
they did not differ from common chronic diseases in
most domains. These findings may be in line with previ-
ous research which has found that people with congeni-
tal or early onset disabilities and RDs are better adapted
and have better disability self-efficacy than those with
acquired conditions [29]. Persons with congenital or
early onset RDs have had a long time to adapt, and went
through their cognitive, physical, and social development
with their RD conditions [29]. Thus, they may not ex-
perience a functional loss and are less likely to have ex-
perienced a change in identity [29].
Our study is noteworthy for its large, diverse sam-
ple of people with RDs and use of PROMIS to make
comparisons
to
representative
population
norms.
However, our findings should be considered in light
of certain methodological limitations. As with most
RD research, it is not possible to determine the repre-
sentativeness of our sample because there is little re-
search on the demographics of people living with RD
[8]. Further, the U.S. does not track diagnoses of most
RDs [1], so it is not possible to assess whether certain
RDs were over- or under- represented in our sample.
For this reason, RD prevalence estimates may change
and categorization of diseases as rare or not may
change over time. Additionally, our sample had higher
income than the general U.S. population. As higher
income is associated with higher quality of life in our
sample and others [30], and the population of people
with RD may be less connected to RD networks and
have lower income than our sample, it stands to rea-
son that the population of people with RD as a whole
may have even poorer HRQL than our results indi-
cate. It should be noted that the second largest study
of individuals with diverse RDs (n = 810), which was
conducted in Australia using similar sampling and
data collection methods, had a number of similar
demographics: a high number of people living with
multiple RDs (16%), a high number of neurological
RDs, about three quarters of their sample was female,
and the majority were middle-aged.
Another consideration is the heterogeneity in RD
experiences that may result from our efforts to sam-
ple diverse RDs. For example, a participant with cuta-
neous T cell lymphoma who is relapsing would likely
have poorer HRQL than someone who is in remis-
sion. That participants scored, on average, signifi-
cantly poorer in HRQL compared to non-RD samples
despite this heterogeneity, strengthens our conclusion
that people with RDs as a whole are at greater risk of
HRQL problems. This suggests that even people with
mild or remitting symptoms need more support than
those with common diseases. The final limitation is
that Orphanet acknowledges that their linearization
rules for categorizing diseases are sometimes some-
what arbitrary [24]. For example, according to their
rules, endocrine tumors are classified as rare neo-
plasms rather than endocrine disease, even though
the RD has features of both categories [24]. For this
reason, nuances between RDs and categories may
have been missed.
Conclusions
There is a paucity of research on and interventions
for HRQL
in
people
with
RD.
People
with
RDs
strongly desire to meet others with their condition
[31]. but most have never done so [3]. Research on
the RD Moebius syndrome suggests that offering ways
for people with RDs to gather for social support may
buttress quality of life by reducing stigma, increasing
knowledgeability about the RD, and reducing isolation
[32, 33]. Our group is currently examining the sup-
port needs of people with RD to better understand
unique challenges and identify sources of resilience to
be built upon.
RD HRQL disparities are driven by insufficient funding
and infrastructure for research, treatment, and psycho-
social support; there is nothing inherent in the pathology
of RDs that creates a greater challenge to HRQL than a
common chronic disease. A number of RD organizations
target important challenges such as identification of new
treatments and cures, understanding causal pathways,
providing information to patients, caregivers, and pro-
viders, and lobbying for policy conducive to orphan drug
discovery. However, few organizations prioritize HRQL
issues like psychosocial support. For example, none of
the Request for Applications (RFAs) funded by the NIH’s
Rare Disease Clinical Research Network included any
objectives or priorities to assess psycho-social support or
outcomes [34, 35]. All RFAs were focused on genetic
and epidemiological studies or clinical trials for diagnos-
tic or treatment services. As most individuals with RDs
will not be cured in their lifetimes [5], identifying ways
to improve HRQL is of utmost importance to patient-
centered care. For these reasons, we recommend that
RD HRQL should be included in mission statements
and funding priorities of health agencies and RD organi-
zations. This may be of particular importance for rare
systemic and rheumatologic, neurological, and immune
diseases, which involved the most significant HRQL
challenges. These efforts should especially target women
and individuals with low income, who experienced the
most HRQL deficits.
