BACKGROUND: Patient, physician, and environmental factors were identified, and the authors examined the contribution of these fac-
tors to demographic and health variation in colonoscopy follow-up after a positive fecal occult blood test/fecal immunochemical test
(FOBT/FIT) screening. METHODS: In total, 76,243 FOBT/FIT-positive patients were identified from 120 Veterans Health Administration
(VHA) facilities between August 16, 2009 and March 20, 2011 and were followed for 6 months. Patient demographic (race/ethnicity,
sex, age, marital status) and health characteristics (comorbidities), physician characteristics (training level, whether primary care pro-
vider) and behaviors (inappropriate FOBT/FIT screening), and environmental factors (geographic access, facility type) were identified
from VHA administrative records. Patient behaviors (refusal, private sector colonoscopy use) were estimated with statistical text min-
ing conducted on clinic notes, and follow-up predictors and adjusted rates were estimated using hierarchical logistic regression.
RESULTS: Roughly 50% of individuals completed a colonoscopy at a VHA facility within 6 months. Age and comorbidity score were
negatively associated with follow-up. Blacks were more likely to receive follow-up than whites. Environmental factors attenuated but
did not fully account for these differences. Patient behaviors (refusal, private sector colonoscopy use) and physician behaviors (inap-
propriate screening) fully accounted for the small reverse race disparity and attenuated variation by age and comorbidity score.
Patient behaviors (refusal and private sector colonoscopy use) contributed more to variation in follow-up rates than physician behav-
iors (inappropriate screening). CONCLUSIONS: In the VHA, blacks are more likely to receive colonoscopy follow-up for positive
FOBT/FIT results than whites, and follow-up rates markedly decline with advancing age and comorbidity burden. Patient and physi-
cian behaviors explain race variation in follow-up rates and contribute to variation by age and comorbidity burden. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer was diagnosed in an estimated 134,490 individuals and resulted in an estimated 49,190 deaths in
2016.1 Routine screening can reduce the burden of this disease, and the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends
several screening modalities.2 The fecal occult blood test (FOBT) and the fecal immunochemical test (FIT) are common
screening modalities in many settings, including the 2 largest health care systems in the United States (Kaiser Permanente
and the Veterans Health Administration [VHA]).3,4 However, the benefits of FOBT/FIT screening cannot be achieved
unless positive results are followed by colonoscopy. Prior studies have documented gaps in colonoscopy follow-up rates
among individuals who had positive FOBT/FIT results; and, in many settings, <60% of screenees receive follow-up
before they are due for repeat screening.5-10 Understanding the reasons for these gaps is essential for guiding the develop-
ment of effective strategies for closing them.

Original Article
 Prior studies have reported lower rates of colonos-
copy follow-up for positive FOBT/FIT results associated
with various demographic and health characteristics,
including non-African American race,11 Hispanic ethnic-
ity,12 female sex,12-14 increasing age,10,13,15,16 and comor-
bidities,10 but it is not clear whether these patterns are
because of variation in patient behaviors (eg, refusal), phy-
sician behaviors (eg, potentially inappropriate screening
among those with limited life expectancy or recent prior
colonoscopy), or environmental factors, such as geo-
graphic access to colonoscopy. Two studies indicated that
from 14% to 38% of patients lacking follow-up for posi-
tive FOBT/FIT results had documentation of refusal,
comorbidity, or a contraindication that would preclude
follow-up testing8,17; however, 1 of those studies was lim-
ited to patients ages �70 years,17 and neither study exam-
ined demographic or health-related variation in reasons
for lack of follow-up. It has been observed that variation
in patient refusal of treatment contributes to age and race
differences in the receipt of cancer therapy18; however, to
our knowledge, no studies to date have examined whether
refusal and potentially inappropriate screening contribute
to demographic and health-related differences in colonos-
copy follow-up for positive FOBT/FIT results.
In the current study, we addressed this gap by exam-
ining the contribution of patient behavior (refusal), physi-
cian behavior (potentially inappropriate FOBT/FIT
screening), and environmental factors (access) to demo-
graphic and health variation in colonoscopy after a posi-
tive FOBT/FIT result in a sample of adults ages 50 to 85
years receiving care at a VHA facility. We hypothesized
that any observed differences in follow-up rates by patient
age, race, and comorbidities would be explained by varia-
tion in refusal, inappropriate screening, and access.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Setting and Participants
We identified patients who received positive FOBT/FIT
results from 1 of 120 eligible VHA facilities between
August 16, 2009, and March 20, 2011, and followed
them until September 30, 2011 for colonoscopy comple-
tion or documentation of potentially valid reasons for not
completing colonoscopy. We identified positive FOBT/
FIT results from VHA laboratory records, as described
previously,19 using the codes provided in Supporting
Materials 1 (see online supporting information). We
defined FOBT/FIT-positive cases as any individual or
multiple card series with 1 or more positive result cards.
We restricted the sample to patients who received positive
FOBT/FIT results from facilities that conducted at least
1400 FOBTs in 2009 to permit rigorous examination of
facility-level variation in follow-up colonoscopy.19 We
excluded individuals if they were aged <50 or >85 years
at the time of the positive FOBT/FIT result, had a diag-
nosis of colorectal cancer, or died during the follow-up
interval. To minimize the number of patients with miss-
ing data, we also excluded those who received their posi-
tive FOBT/FIT result from a VHA Community-Based
Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) that referred <70% of colo-
noscopies to 1 of the sampled facilities or from a facility in
which >90% of patients were missing data from clinical
notes that were necessary to assess refusal and private sec-
tor colonoscopy use. With these criteria, we identified
76,243 individuals who received positive FOBT/FIT
results from 120 VHA facilities for the current analysis
(Fig. 1).
Data Sources and Measures
The dependent measure for our analysis was a completed
follow-up colonoscopy at a VHA facility within 6 months
of the date of a positive FOBT/FIT result. We used this
follow-up window because, consistent with previous stud-
ies,10 most individuals in the VHA who complete colo-
noscopy after a positive FOBT/FIT result do so within 6
months. We identified completed colonoscopies from
VHA administrative data using the codes provided in Sup-
porting Materials 2 (see online supporting information).
Predictors
Guided by the Diagnostic Evaluation Model,20,21 we dis-
tinguished between patient, physician, and environmental
predictors of follow-up. The patient factors examined con-
sisted of: demographic and health characteristics, includ-
ing race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, Hispanic, black,
American Indian, Asian or Pacific Islander), sex, age (ages
50-59, 60-64, 65-75, and 76-85 years), and marital status
(married, widowed, other), Charlson comorbidity score
for the year before the positive FOBT/FIT result (0, 1-2,
or �3); mental health diagnoses (psychiatric only, sub-
stance abuse only, dual diagnosis, or none), personal his-
tory
of
colorectal
polyps
or
benign
neoplasms
(International Classification of Diseases for Oncology,
9th revision, codes 211.3-211.4, 569.0, and v12.72), and
behaviors (colonoscopy refusal, use of private sector colo-
noscopy for follow-up). We used statistical text mining to
identify documentation of refusal and private colonos-
copy
using
a
validated
algorithm,
as
previously
described.19 This algorithm searched consult, progress,
primary care, and clinical reminder notes entered during

 the follow-up interval for key phrases associated with
refusal or private sector colonoscopy use and assigned
each positive FOBT or FIT patient with 2 continuous
scores: 1 corresponding to the probability that their notes
contained documentation of refusal, and 1 corresponding
to the probability that their notes contained documenta-
tion of private sector colonoscopy use. We used the proba-
bilities from statistical text mining to assign refusal and
private sector colonoscopy status to each individual with-
out VHA follow-up. The distributions for these probabili-
ties were disparate and tended toward extreme values.
Our intent was to gauge the sensitivity of the initial
findings to these unobserved outcomes; so, rather than
performing a complex Monte Carlo simulation study, we
classified notes with a refusal probability � .60 as indicat-
ing that the patient refused follow-up, and notes with a
private sector colonoscopy probability � .93 were classi-
fied as indicating that the patient pursued private sector
colonoscopy. We selected these thresholds based on the
probability distributions (Supporting Figs. 1 and 2; see
online supporting information).
The physician factors examined included: physician
characteristics, such as FOBT/FIT ordering provider
training (physician, nurse practitioner or physician
Figure 1. This is a flowchart of patients from the current study. FOBT/FIT1 indicates positive fecal occult blood test/fecal immu-

 assistant, resident, nurse, or other staff) and whether the
ordering physician was the patient’s primary care pro-
vider; and the physician behavior of potentially inappro-
priate screening (ie, patient has limited life expectancy,
VHA colonoscopy in prior 10 years).
The environmental factors examined consisted of
geographic access indicators, including residence (urban,
rural) and drive time to the nearest VHA specialty care
facility (<30, 30-60, or >60 minutes), and FOBT/FIT
ordering facility type (specialty care or CBOC). We used
administrative data to identify all predictors.
Analysis
Hierarchical regression was used to model the odds of
completing follow-up colonoscopy within 6 months to
identify individual-level predictors of follow-up. These
models incorporated random effects for facility and fixed
effects for the measures listed in Table 1. To select varia-
bles for the final model, we used a bootstrap resampling
model-selection algorithm.22 This involved constructing
500 bootstrap samples using a forward-selection algo-
rithm with each individual sample to develop a boot-
strapped model and retaining predictors that were
selected in 90% of these models for inclusion in the final
model. From the final model, we constructed model-
based odds ratios and least-square mean follow-up esti-
mates for each measure (using the observed marginal dis-
tributions of other covariates). We did not hypothesize
interactions between predictors and thus did not include
interaction terms in the model.
To assess the sensitivity of estimates to patient and
physician behaviors that might explain lack of VHA
follow-up, we reran our models excluding individuals who
potentially had been screened inappropriately (n 5 343
with limited life expectancy, n 5 11,987 with a prior colo-
noscopy); and we treated those who refused colonoscopy
(n 5 7708), pursued private sector colonoscopy (n 5
8666), or both (n 5 2510) as having received follow-up.

Colorectal Cancer Screening Follow-Up/Partin et al
Cancer
September 15, 2017

 This study was reviewed and approved by the institutional
review boards at the Minneapolis and Boston Veterans
Affairs Healthcare Systems.
RESULTS
Patients were primarily non-Hispanic white (65%) men
(96%) ages 50 to 75 years (89%) (Table 1). Roughly one-
half (54%) were married, 27% had �3 comorbidities,
68% had a mental health or substance-abuse diagnosis,
and 20% had a personal history of polyps. The majority
had their FOBT/FIT ordered by a physician (72%) who
was their primary care provider (72%). Less than 1% had
limited life expectancy, and 16% had a VHA colonoscopy
in the prior 10 years. Roughly one-half (51%) lived in
rural areas, 42% lived more than 60 minutes away from
the nearest VHA specialty care facility, and 57% had their
FOBT/FIT ordered at a CBOC.
Among the 76,243 patients who had positive FOBT/
FIT results, 38,005 (50%) completed a colonoscopy at a
VHA facility within 6 months; 7294 (10%) did not com-
plete a colonoscopy but were potentially inappropriately
screened, either because of limited life expectancy (0.27%)
or because they had a recent prior colonoscopy at a VHA
facility (9.29%); up to 13,863 (18%) did not complete a
colonoscopy but either refused a VHA colonoscopy (7%),
pursued a private sector colonoscopy (8%), or both (3%);
and at least 17,010 (22%) had no reason documented for
not completing a colonoscopy.
Patient Factors
With the exception of sex, residence, and provider type,
all factors examined were significantly associated with
follow-up rates in univariate models (Table 2). Patient
factors that were retained in the multivariate model
included race/ethnicity, age, a personal history of polyps,
and comorbidity score. Age (odds ratio, 2.01-3.10 for the
younger vs oldest age category) was a strong independent
predictor, corresponding to follow-up rate differences as
large as 29 percentage points. A personal history of polyps
(odds ratio, 2.57) was positively associated, and the Charl-
son score was negatively associated, with follow-up.
Patients with Charlson scores �3 had follow-up rates 5
percentage points lower than those with a score of zero
(46% vs 51%). We observed a small reverse race disparity,
with blacks demonstrating follow-up rates 4 percentage
points higher than whites.
Physician Factors
Patients whose FOBT/FIT was ordered by their primary
care provider had follow-up rates that were 7 percentage
points higher than those whose FOBT/FIT was not
ordered by their primary care provider. Colonoscopy in
the prior 10 years (odds ratio, 1.66) was the only indicator
of potentially inappropriate screening included in the
multivariate model. Those with no prior colonoscopy in
the past 10 years had a follow-up rate 12 percentage points
higher than those with a prior colonoscopy (51% vs 39%,
respectively).
Environmental Factors
No geographic access measures were retained in the multi-
variate model, but those who had an FOBT/FIT ordered
at a specialty care facility had follow-up rates that were 7
percentage points higher than those who had a test
ordered at a CBOC.
After excluding potentially inappropriately screened
individuals and treating patients who refused colonoscopy
or pursued colonoscopy in the private sector as having
received follow-up, the small differences by race/ethnicity
were further attenuated (Fig. 2, Supporting Table 1; see
online supporting information), and the differences by age
(Fig. 3, Supporting Table 1; see online supporting infor-
mation) and Charlson score (Fig. 4, Supporting Table 1;
see online supporting information) were markedly attenu-
ated. Patient behavior (refusals and private sector colonos-
copy use) contributed more to the variation in follow-up
rates by age, race, and Charlson score than physician
behavior (inappropriate screening), although all 3 increased
with age and Charlson score and were more common
among whites than blacks (Figs. (2 and 3), and 4).
DISCUSSION
The current study demonstrated that 50% of FOBT/FIT-
positive patients completed a follow-up colonoscopy in
the VHA within 6 months; that age and comorbidities
were negatively associated with follow-up; and that blacks
were more likely to receive follow-up in the VHA than
whites. Multivariate models controlling for environmen-
tal factors, including geographic access, attenuated but
did not fully account for these differences. Adjusting for
patient behaviors (refusal and private sector colonoscopy
use) and physician behaviors (potentially inappropriate
screening) fully accounted for the small reverse race dis-
parity and markedly attenuated variation by age and
comorbidities.
Our observation of the contribution of potentially
inappropriate screening because of a recent prior colonos-
copy to the follow-up rate is consistent with findings from
prior studies, including 1 that identified recent colonoscopy
as a prevalent reason for failure to complete follow-up12

 and 2 that reported a strong association between colonos-
copy history and follow-up of a positive FOBT/FIT
result.15,16 Potentially inappropriate screening because of
limited life expectancy was relatively rare in our sample
(<1%),17 as also documented in prior studies conducted
in samples ages 50 to 75 years.23 The frequency of refusal
among those who failed to complete a colonoscopy we
observed (14%-21%, depending on whether those who
refused are combined with those who both refused and had
private sector colonoscopy access) was similar to colonos-
copy follow-up refusal rates reported in prior studies
(range, 7%-26%).12,16,17,24,25
Although prior studies have documented lower rates
of colorectal cancer screening26 and surveillance27 among
racial and ethnic minority groups, findings regarding
race/ethnic variation in colonoscopy follow-up for posi-
tive FOBT/FIT results are mixed. One prior study con-
ducted in a community practice12 reported lower follow-
up rates among Hispanics, but most prior studies have
reported either no evidence of race/ethnic variation in fol-
low-up5,10,28 or higher follow-up rates among minori-
ties.16,29,30 In addition, compared with previous studies
documenting higher refusal among blacks for invasive
procedures and treatments, including coronary angiogra-
phy31-34 and revascularization,32,35 we observed lower
refusal rates among blacks than among whites. This may
in part reflect the finding that blacks are more likely to
rely solely on VHA care36-42 and thus may be less likely to
refuse because of access to private sector colonoscopy. The
race variation in use of VHA care may be explained in part
by well documented race variations in income, education,
and insurance coverage, all of which are positively associ-
ated
with
greater
use

non-VHA
care
among
Veterans.37,39,40
Our finding that age and comorbidities were nega-
tively associated with follow-up is consistent with previous
reports.5,10,13,16,24,43 Studies that demonstrated no signif-
icant association between follow-up and these factors
either restricted the sample to the oldest age groups17 or
excluded those aged >75 years.6,12,15,44 It is not clear why
the effects of age and comorbidity on follow-up were not
fully explained by other patient characteristics, patient
behaviors (refusal, private sector colonoscopy use), physi-
cian behaviors (inappropriate screening), or environmen-
tal factors. Possible explanations include: lower patient
and provider motivation to aggressively pursue follow-up

 under circumstances of advanced age or severe comorbid-
ity because of lower perceived benefits and greater per-
ceived risks of colonoscopy; greater likelihood that those
with advanced age and severe comorbidity experience
acute health challenges and logistical barriers that com-
pete with follow-up; or a failure to capture all refusal, pri-
vate sector colonoscopy, and inappropriate screening with
the measures employed.
This study has several strengths, including a large,
nationally representative sample of patients and facilities;
rigorous methodology for assessing the impact of inappro-
priate screening, refusal, and private sector colonoscopy
use on variation in follow-up rates by patient demo-
graphic and health characteristics; and the ability to exam-
ine the association between environmental factors and
follow-up rate estimates. However, we were not able to
assess patient psychosocial reasons for lack of follow-up.
Understanding the contribution of patient perspectives
and experiences will likely be critical to developing effec-
tive interventions to improve follow-up rates. We also
might have overestimated inappropriate screening, given
that some consider FOBT/FIT screening conducted more
than 5 years after a prior colonoscopy as clinically
appropriate. In addition, because we did not link our sam-
ple with private sector medical records, our assumption
that patients who pursued colonoscopy in the private sec-
tor actually completed a colonoscopy might lead to over-
estimates of follow-up rates. However, the finding from
another study that only 2% of patients who did not com-
plete a VHA colonoscopy and said they were pursuing
colonoscopy in the private sector lacked a Medicare claim
for a colonoscopy17 suggests this overestimate is likely
small. Finally, the VHA population is unique and may
not generalize to other settings. However, as the largest
integrated health care system in the United States, the
VHA population does generalize to a substantial number
of individuals, including non-VHA Medicare beneficiary
populations.45
CONCLUSIONS
In the VHA setting, blacks are more likely to receive colo-
noscopy follow-up for positive FOBT/FIT results than
whites, and follow-up rates significantly decline with
advancing age and comorbidity burden. Patient behaviors
(refusal, private sector colonoscopy use) and physician
behaviors (inappropriate screening) explain race/ethnicity

 variation in follow-up rates and contribute to variation by
age and comorbidity burden.
Implications for Practice
Our finding that geographic access metrics were not sig-
nificant predictors of follow-up suggest that policies like
the Veteran Choice and Accountability Act, which expand
geographic access for Veterans by purchasing care from
private sector providers, may not fully address existing
gaps in follow-up. Inappropriate screening is an impor-
tant, modifiable physician behavioral barrier to improving
follow-up rates, and future efforts to optimize follow-up
would benefit from implementing methods to reliably
exclude those with recent colonoscopy from clinical
reminders and other tools designed to prompt physicians
to initiate colorectal cancer screening. The VHA has a sys-
tem in place for tracking patients who have positive
FOBT/FIT screens at the facility-level, but the extent to
which this tool is used and whether and how well non-
VHA colonoscopies are tracked at the facility level are
unknown. Future improvement efforts might seek to
enhance the functionality of this tool by assessing whether
and how accurately non-VHA colonoscopy information
is included and to encourage its use through leadership
and resource support. Additional improvement efforts
might evaluate approaches to reduce inappropriate screen-
ing. Implementing a centralized eligibility assessment and
tracking system that incorporates information on prior
colonoscopy history, age, comorbidities, and/or life
expectancy is 1 promising strategy to explore.
