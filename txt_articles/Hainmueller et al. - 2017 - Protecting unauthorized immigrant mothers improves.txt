The United States is embroiled in a debate about whether to protect or deport its
estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants, but the fact that these immigrants are
also parents to more than 4 million U.S.-born children is often overlooked. We provide
causal evidence of the impact of parents’ unauthorized immigration status on the health
of their U.S. citizen children. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program
granted temporary protection from deportation to more than 780,000 unauthorized
immigrants. We used Medicaid claims data from Oregon and exploited the quasi-random
assignment of DACA eligibility among mothers with birthdates close to the DACA age
qualification cutoff. Mothers’ DACA eligibility significantly decreased adjustment and
anxiety disorder diagnoses among their children. Parents’ unauthorized status is thus a
substantial barrier to normal child development and perpetuates health inequalities
through the intergenerational transmission of disadvantage.
T
here is an ongoing, heated debate about
the fate of the estimated 11 million un-
authorized immigrants living in the United
States. One important and often overlooked
issue in these policy debates is that un-
authorized immigrants are also parents to more
than 4 million children who are U.S. citizens by
birth (1, 2). How are these children affected by
the unauthorized status of their parents? Re-
search has largely focused on the impacts of un-
authorized status on the immigrants themselves
(3), but we know much less about the potential
intergenerational effects of this status on the
well-being of their offspring (4).
A growing body of research has demonstrated
links between parental immigration status and
child development (5–10) and generated insights
into how it might affect children’s health. Chil-
dren of unauthorized immigrant parents face
challenges beyond low socioeconomic status, in-
cluding parental anxiety, fear of separation, and
acculturative stress. Parent-child separations can
be harmful to children’s health, economic secu-
rity, and long-term development. Virtually all of
these studies have been qualitative or correla-
tional because of the difficulties in isolating the
causal effects of parents’ immigration status and
collecting systematic data on large samples of
unauthorized immigrants.
Families with unauthorized immigrant parents
differ from families with authorized immigrant
parents in many confounding characteristics
(e.g., education, health care, and poverty) that
might generate differences in child outcomes
(11–13). This nonrandom selection implies that
typical observational studies cannot isolate the
causal effect of immigration status. Indeed, a
recent consensus statement of the Society for
Research on Adolescence (14) concludes that
“Nonexperimental or quasiexperimental research
with strong causal inference...has been lacking to
date in studies of policies and practices related to
unauthorized status.”
The study of unauthorized status is further con-
strained by the difficulty of collecting systematic
samples, because unauthorized immigrants are
underrepresented in general population surveys
(15). Moreover, questions about the unauthorized
status of immigrants are typically avoided given
concerns about confidentiality and reporting
biases (16). Researchers therefore often have to
resort to noisy proxies for unauthorized status,
such as the identification of individuals as foreign-
born, Hispanic, or Spanish-speaking (17, 18).
We provide causal evidence of the intergen-
erational impact of parental immigration status
on children’s health. We focus on the Deferred
Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program,
which is one of the most extensive policies di-
rected toward unauthorized immigrants in recent
decades. The DACA program, announced in 2012
by President Obama, protects recipients from
deportation by granting them a 2-year (renew-
able) deferred action status, while also allow-
ing them to obtain temporary work authorization.
More than 780,000 unauthorized immigrants so
far have received deferred action through this
program (19) (fig. S1). Although DACA recipients
arrived in the United States as children, many
are now adults and have become parents them-
selves. An estimated 200,000 children had parents
who were eligible for DACA at the time the policy
was announced (2). Although some studies have
found that DACA recipients have higher rates of
employment (20–22) and improved health out-
comes (23, 24), the intergenerational effects of
DACA are largely unknown.
To address the sampling problem, we used
data from Emergency Medicaid, a government
program that provides coverage for emergencies
and labor and delivery services for low-income
individuals who are not eligible for Medicaid.
The program mainly serves unauthorized immi-
grants, but lawful permanent residents with less
than 5 years of residency can also obtain cover-
age. Estimates from states such as California and
North Carolina indicate that 90 to 99% of Emer-
gency Medicaid recipients are unauthorized
immigrants (25, 26). In addition, because U.S.-
born children of unauthorized immigrants are
U.S. citizens, they are eligible for full-scope Med-
icaid benefits and can be tracked with Medicaid
claims data.
To overcome the causal identification prob-
lem, we applied a regression discontinuity (RD)
design (27) that leverages the DACA eligibility
criterion (28) stipulating that recipients must
have been under age 31 as of 15 June 2012. Hence,
a person born on 16 June 1981 meets the DACA
age eligibility requirement, whereas a person
born on 14 June 1981 does not. The age eligibility
criterion was announced when DACA was adopted
on 15 June 2012. The Emergency Medicaid en-
rollment data include the mother’s exact date
of birth, and this permits us to leverage a quasi-
experiment in which DACA eligibility is as good
as randomly assigned for those born around the
arbitrary birthdate cutoff. We do not observe
whether mothers apply for DACA, but given that
mothers who were born just before or after the
DACA birthdate cutoff are similar in confound-
ing characteristics, we can isolate the intention-
to-treat effect of DACA eligibility on the health of
their children. Prior studies provide evidence that
RD designs that exploit arbitrary cutoff points
in eligibility criteria are effective in replicating
results from randomized experiments (29–31).
We drew on Medicaid claims data from Oregon
to identify 5653 mothers born between 1980 and
1982 who were covered by Emergency Medicaid
and gave birth to 8610 children during 2003 to
2015. We then tracked the children’s mental
health outcomes by using their Medicaid claims.
The children in our sample were born in Oregon
and are therefore U.S. citizens by birth; 49%
are female, 73% are Hispanic, and they were be-
tween 0 and 12 years old in 2015 (table S1 pro-
vides descriptive statistics).
Although parental DACA eligibility could af-
fect a broad range of child health outcomes, we
focused on the impacts on children’s mental

 health. Because DACA offered the mothers im-
mediate relief from the risk of deportation, ma-
ternal stress might have declined, and their
children would no longer have had to fear being
separated from them. Therefore, the children’s
mental well-being could have improved (4, 6).
Moreover, examining mental health disorders
that originate in childhood is important because
they are associated with long-term health issues,
low education, and welfare dependence, which
generate considerable private and social costs
(32–34).
We focused on disorders that result from ex-
ternal events, rather than genetic or physiologi-
cal factors. We prespecified all outcomes and
analyses, except when otherwise noted, in a pre-
registered analysis plan made available at the
Evidence in Governance and Politics website
under study ID 20170227AC. Our main child out-
come is a broad measure of any diagnoses of
adjustment disorder, acute stress disorder, or
anxiety disorder, measured using all diagnoses
in the International Classification of Diseases 9
(ICD-9) categories 309, 308, and 300 (35).
Adjustment disorder is a reaction to an iden-
tified stressor, leading to an inability to function
normally. It is diagnosed on the basis of symp-
toms of anxiety, depressed mood, and conduct
disturbances and often results in considerable
impairment in important areas of functioning,
such as social activities, school performance, and
sleep (36, 37). Acute stress disorder can be a
precursor to a diagnosis of a more lasting post-
traumatic stress disorder (included in the ICD-9
category 309, adjustment disorder). It is charac-
terized by symptoms or behaviors similar to
those that arise from exposure to a traumatic or
stressful event, but acute stress disorders cannot
(by definition) last longer than 1 month (36). Be-
cause stress disorder and adjustment disorder
are related, we prespecified both as a combined
outcome measure of adjustment disorder. Anx-
iety disorders are characterized by excessive
fear, anxiety, and related behavioral disturban-
ces that can lead to substantial distress or im-
pairment. An external stressor might not be
clearly identified, and anxiety disorders can be
caused by environmental, genetic, or physiolog-
ical factors (36).
These mental health disorders in childhood
are associated with considerable developmen-
tal, psychosocial, and psychopathological com-
plications for children and their families (32).
For the children in our sample who were diag-
nosed with adjustment disorder, acute stress
disorder, or anxiety disorder, the first diagno-
ses occurred on average at 6.7 years of age with
a standard deviation of 2.6 years (tables S1 and
S2 provide descriptive statistics). Details about
the measures, sample, design, and statistical anal-
ysis can be found in the materials and methods
section of the supplementary materials.
Figure 1 illustrates the main finding and quasi-
experimental nature of the RD design. The per-
cent of children diagnosed with adjustment or
anxiety disorders during the post-DACA period
(2013 to 2015) dropped by about 4.5 percentage
points (P = 0.037; local linear regression) at the
birthdate cutoff where mothers become eligi-
ble for DACA. This reduction, from 7.8 to 3.3%,
provides evidence that mothers’ DACA eligi-
bility sharply improved their children’s men-
tal health.
The causal logic of the RD design is based
on the idea that the DACA birthdate cutoff is
an arbitrary date, and, therefore, children of in-
eligible mothers born just before the birthdate
cutoff should be similar in all respects, includ-
ing in possible confounding characteristics, to
children of DACA-eligible mothers born just
after the cutoff. This continuity assumption was
corroborated by a series of checks where we
testedfordiscontinuities inpre-DACAbackground
characteristics at the DACA birthdate cutoff.
The results (Fig. 1, bottom left) demonstrate
that there was no discernible difference in the
prevalence of disorder diagnoses at the same
cutoff date for the pre-DACA period (2003 to
quarter 2, 2012). The difference in diagnosis rates
at the cutoff was an insignificant 0.4 percentage
points (P = 0.817; local linear regression). Figure 1,
bottom right, shows the distribution of P values
from similar checks where we tested for dis-
continuities in other background covariates at
the birthdate cutoff, such as the children’s eth-
nicity, race, year of birth, and pre-DACA health
care utilization (tables S3 and S4). The distri-
bution of P values is consistent with the uniform
distribution that we would expect for balance
checks in a randomized experiment, indicating
that there were no systematic discontinuities in
the covariates at the birthdate cutoff. Further-
more, density tests for manipulation of mothers’
birthdates revealed no evidence of sorting around
the threshold (fig. S2). All tests suggested that our
RD design can isolate the causal effects of mothers’
DACA eligibility at the birthdate cutoff.

Pre−DACA Characteristics
Fig. 1. Results from applying the regression discontinuity design. (Top) In the post-DACA period
(2013 to 2015), children of DACA-eligible mothers (born after 15 June 1981) experienced markedly
lower rates of diagnosed adjustment and/or anxiety disorders than children of ineligible mothers
(born before 15 June 1981). Lines are average diagnosis rates (with 95% confidence bands) from
local linear regressions fitted to the sample of children whose mothers’ birthdates were within
±150 days of the DACA eligibility cutoff (n = 2260), and circles are average diagnosis rates within
each 15-day birthdate interval. (Bottom left) There was no such difference in children’s diagnosis
rates in the pre-DACA period (2003 to 2012). (Bottom right) There was no statistical evidence
for discontinuities in other background characteristics that might confound the comparison at the
DACA birthdate eligibility cutoff.

 Figure 2 shows the point estimates and con-
fidence intervals for the RD estimates of the
intention-to-treat effects of mothers’ DACA eli-
gibility on the children’s mental health outcomes,
for the combined measure and its separate com-
ponents (tables S5 and S6 and fig. S3). The es-
timates are based on prespecified standard local
linear regression models fitted to trimmed sam-
ples including only children whose mothers’ birth-
dates were within the adaptive mean squared
error optimal bandwidths around the birthdate
cutoff (38).
We found that mothers’ eligibility for DACA
protection led to a significant improvement in
their children’s mental health. Specifically, mothers’
DACA eligibility reduced adjustment and anxiety
disorder diagnoses in their children by 4.3 per-
centage points (P = 0.023) from a baseline rate of
7.9% among children of ineligible mothers at
the threshold. This represents more than a 50%
drop in the rate of these disorders, albeit with a
wide 95% confidence interval (CI) for the mag-
nitude of the estimated effect, ranging from 0.6
to 7.9 percentage points. When we looked only
at adjustment disorders, which are disorders
attributable to an identifiable external stressor,
the estimated reduction was 4.4 percentage
points (P = 0.013; 95% CI, 0.9 to 7.8). There was
also a reduction in anxiety disorders, which is a
more heterogeneous category of mental illness,
but it was insignificant at conventional levels
(P = 0.153; 95% CI, –0.6 to 4.1). Lastly, we found
that for the same sample of children, before the
DACA program, there were no discernible dif-
ferences in these mental health diagnoses at
the cutoff (Fig. 2, right).
We conducted several checks that supported
the robustness of the results, such as varying the
bandwidths (fig. S4), using alternative estima-
tion procedures (fig. S5 and table S7), removing
children born in the post-DACA period (fig. S6
and table S8), redefining the post-DACA period
to include quarters 3 and 4 of 2012 (fig. S7 and
table S9), and using alternative codings of the
mental health outcomes based on the Diagnos-
tic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(fig. S8 and table S10; not prespecified). A non-
prespecified subgroup analysis (fig. S9) suggested
that the effect of mothers’ DACA eligibility was
concentrated among the older children in our
sample (ages 6 to 12; table S12), with no dis-
cernible effect among younger children (ages 0
to 5; table S11); younger children are generally
much less likely to receive mental health diagno-
ses. We also conducted a non-prespecified sub-
group analysis by gender (fig. S10 and tables S13
and S14) and found that the effect of mothers’
DACA eligibility on adjustment disorders was
slightly more pronounced among male children,
but the effect for males was not statistically
significantly different from that for females (P =
0.209; local linear regression).
We also confirmed that there were no dis-
cernible differences in diagnoses at the same
birthdate cutoff among children of mothers who
were covered by standard Medicaid at the time
that they gave birth (fig. S11 and table S15). These
mothers should not be affected by DACA eligi-
bility, given that standard Medicaid in Oregon is
open only to low-income U.S. citizens and long-
term lawful permanent residents. This check
again underscores that in the absence of changes
in DACA eligibility, there is no evidence of con-
founders associated with having a mother who
is born just before or after the cutoff date that
could explain the observed post-DACA difference
in child mental health outcomes.
Because health care utilization could be af-
fected by immigration status (9), we also checked
for the possibility that the drop in diagnoses
reflects a DACA-induced change in health care
visits, which could affect the probability of de-
tection of mental health disorders. We found
no support for this. Mothers’ DACA eligibility
had no discernible impact on their children’s
health care utilization during the post-DACA
period, as measured either by the total number
of visits, the number of emergency room (ER) and
urgent care visits, or the number of outpatient
visits (fig. S12 and table S16). Consistent with
this, in a non-prespecified analysis, we also found
that the effects of mothers’ DACA eligibility on
child mental health were similar when we re-
stricted the sample to children who had at least
one health care visit in the post-DACA period
(fig. S13 and table S17).
Our results provide causal evidence support-
ing the theory that parental unauthorized im-
migration status has important intergenerational
effects on the well-being and development of
children in immigrant families (4, 6). Protecting
unauthorized immigrants from deportation led
to immediate and sizable improvements in the
mental health of their U.S. citizen children. This
suggests that parents’ unauthorized status is a
substantial stressor that stymies normal child
development and perpetuates health inequal-
ities by transferring parental disadvantages to
children.
Our findings have important implications for
immigration and health care policy. As decision-
makers evaluate whether to maintain, cancel, or
expand the DACA program, our results suggest
that a broader consideration is needed, one that
goes beyond the impacts for recipients alone and
takes into account the intergenerational conse-
quences of deferred action for the health of un-
authorized immigrants’ children, most of whom
are U.S. citizens (2). Early childhood exposure to
stress and adversity does not only cause poor
health and impaired development in the short
term; the issues can also persist into adulthood.
Anxiety and psychosocial stress are identified
as risk factors for depression, substance abuse,
cardiovascular diseases, andobesity (32, 34, 39, 40).
Treatment of mental disorders also carries con-
siderable economic costs to society. They account
for the highest total health care expenditures of
all children’s medical conditions (41) and are as-
sociated with poor long-term outcomes for school
performance and welfare reliance (33, 42). By
reducing mental health problems, deferred ac-
tion has important multiplier effects through
improving the future prospects of the children
of unauthorized immigrants.
Our results imply that expanding deferred
action to the millions of unauthorized immi-
grant parents who do not meet the current DACA
eligibility criteria could further promote the

Fig. 2. Effect of mothers’ DACA eligibility on their children’s mental health. (Left) Mothers’ DACA
eligibility reduced child mental health disorders in the post-DACA period. (Right) There were no
systematic, preexisting differences in the pre-DACA period. Circles with lines represent effect
estimates with 95% confidence intervals from the regression discontinuity design, based on local
linear regressions fitted to samples of children whose mothers’ birthdates were within a symmetric
bandwidth of days around the DACA eligibility cutoff. The size of the bandwidth was determined
by an adaptive bandwidth selection algorithm for each outcome. The bandwidths and sample sizes
for the three outcomes in the post-DACA period (top to bottom) are ±199 days around the cutoff
(n = 3039 children), ±180 days (n = 2741), and ±132 days (n = 2002); for the pre-DACA period
(top to bottom), the bandwidths and sample sizes are ±108 days (n = 1325), ±109 days (n = 1338),
and ±211 days (n = 2745).

 health and well-being of this next generation of
American citizens. Moreover, it is reasonable to
expect that permanent legal status or a path-
way to citizenship would have an equal, if not
greater, effect on improving children’s health.
Our study also has implications for health
policy research. Unauthorized immigration is
an important policy issue, but researchers have
struggled to generate a reliable evidence base.
Although we recognize the limitations of evalu-
ating health outcome data from one state, our
sampling strategy of using Emergency Medicaid
mothers and Medicaid children provides an ef-
fective way to overcome some of the challenges
in collecting systematic data from the unautho-
rized population. This approach opens the door
for future studies to examine the impacts of an
array of local, state, and federal policies that af-
fect unauthorized immigrant parents and that
may have health consequences for their children.

35. When we use the terms adjustment disorder, acute
stress disorder, or anxiety disorder, we refer to
all the diagnoses included under the ICD-9 categories
300, 308, and 309, respectively. These categories include
several subcategories of diagnoses. For example, we
observed 13 subcategories under category 309 (adjustment
reaction), such as 309.0 (adjustment disorder, depressed
mood), 309.21 (separation anxiety disorder), 309.24
(adjustment disorder, anxiety), 309.3 (adjustment
disorder, disturbance of conduct), and 309.81 (post-
traumatic stress disorder). Table S2 in the supplementary
materials provides a list of all subcategories, as well as
descriptive statistics.
