Currently available influenza virus vaccines have inadequate effectiveness and are refor-
mulated annually due to viral antigenic drift. Thus, development of a vaccine that confers
long-term protective immunity against antigenically distant influenza virus strains is urgently
needed. The highly conserved influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) stalk represents one of the
potential targets of broadly protective/universal influenza virus vaccines. Here, we evaluate a
potent broadly protective influenza virus vaccine candidate that uses nucleoside-modified
and purified mRNA encoding full-length influenza virus HA formulated in lipid nanoparticles
(LNPs). We demonstrate that immunization with HA mRNA-LNPs induces antibody
responses against the HA stalk domain of influenza virus in mice, rabbits, and ferrets. The HA
stalk-specific antibody response is associated with protection from homologous, hetero-
logous, and heterosubtypic influenza virus infection in mice.

easonal influenza virus epidemics pose a significant global
health threat. Inactivated and live attenuated vaccines have
limited effectiveness and need to be reformulated every
year. These vaccines induce antibody responses primarily against
the immunodominant globular head domain of influenza virus
hemagglutinin (HA), but the virus can easily escape from pro-
tective immune responses due to the plasticity of the HA head
(reviewed in ref. 1). It may be possible to induce broader pro-
tection with vaccines that target more conserved viral regions,
such as the stalk domain of HA that is less tolerant of escape
mutations (reviewed in ref. 2). In recent years, several HA
immunogens have been developed that elicit HA stalk-specific
immune responses. For example, headless HAs and chimeric HAs
(cHAs) induce potent stalk-reactive antibodies3–7. Heterologous
prime-boost immunizations were also shown to elicit HA stalk-
specific antibodies in preclinical studies6–11. Notably, most HA
stalk-based vaccines require multiple immunizations.
In vitro-transcribed messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines
have shown promise against cancer and infectious diseases
(reviewed in ref. 12). For example, a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)
encapsulated13 1-methylpseudouridine-modified mRNA vaccine
protected mice and non-human primates against Zika virus
infection after a single low dose immunization14. Although,
several recent studies indicate that mRNA-based vaccines can
provide protection against influenza virus infection, none of
these reports determined if mRNA-based influenza virus vaccines
elicited broadly reactive antibodies capable of neutralizing anti-
genically distinct influenza virus strains after a single immuni-
zation15–19.
Here, we demonstrate that vaccination with influenza virus
HA-encoding, nucleoside-modified20, and fast protein liquid
chromatography (FPLC)-purified21 mRNA-LNPs induces potent
antibody responses that target the conserved HA stalk domain in
mice, rabbits, and ferrets. These broadly reactive antibody
responses were associated with protection from homologous,
heterologous, and heterosubtypic influenza viruses in mice. We
propose that nucleoside-modified, FPLC-purified mRNA-LNP
vaccines represent a promising broadly protective influenza virus
vaccine candidate.
Results
HA head and stalk-specific antibody responses in mice. To
evaluate the immunogenicity of the nucleoside-modified HA
mRNA-LNP vaccine, mice were immunized twice with 3, 10, or
30 µg of A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) (A/Cal09) HA-encoding
mRNA-LNPs intradermally (i.d.) or 10, 30, or 90 µg of A/Cali-

(i.m.)
and antibody responses were assessed. The two immunizations
were delivered 4 weeks apart. Control animals were vaccinated
with
30 µg
(i.d.)
or
90 µg
(i.m.)
of
poly(C)
RNA-LNPs.
A single immunization induced potent antibody responses tar-
geting the HA globular head domain as determined by hemag-
glutination inhibition (HAI) assays using the homologous
A/California/07/2009 virus (Fig. 1a, b). Higher vaccine doses
elicited higher HAI titers with subtle differences between the i.d.
and i.m.-immunized animals. A second immunization sub-
stantially increased HAI titers that reached 1:1280–1:20,480
at week 8 (Fig. 1a, b). As expected, antibodies elicited by the
A/California/07/2009 HA mRNA-LNPs had no HAI activity
against the A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 virus (Fig. 1c, d), which
possesses a genetically divergent HA globular head domain
(Supplementary Fig. 1).
We next performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays

 antibodies elicited by nucleoside-modified HA mRNA-LNP
vaccination. For these experiments, we measured antibody
binding to full-length A/California/07/2009 HA and an H6/1
cHA (cH6/1 HA) that possesses an H1 stalk domain and an H6
“exotic” globular head domain. Previous studies have shown that
H1 stalk-reactive antibodies bind to both the full-length H1
construct and the cH6/1 construct, whereas H1 globular head-
reactive antibodies bind only to the full-length H1 construct and
not the cH6/1 construct22. Antibodies from all A/California/07/
2009 HA-vaccinated mice showed very strong binding to full-
length A/California/07/2009 HA after a single immunization
(Fig. 2a, c). Importantly, HA stalk-reactive antibodies capable of
binding to cH6/1 HA were also elicited by a single immunization.
A booster immunization significantly increased HA stalk-reactive
antibodies capable of binding to cH6/1 HA (Fig. 2b, d).
To determine if HA stalk-specific antibodies could be elicited
with a different influenza HA immunogen, mice were i.d.
immunized with a single dose of 30 µg of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934
(PR8) influenza HA mRNA-LNPs or poly(C) RNA-LNPs and
HAI activity and HA stalk-specific antibody responses were
followed over time. A single immunization elicited high HAI
titers against the homologous A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 virus
(Fig. 3a). Consistent with our results using mRNA-LNPs
expressing A/California/07/2009 HA, A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 HA
mRNA-LNPs elicited high levels of antibodies to full-length A/
Puerto Rico/8/1934 HA and a significant portion of these
antibodies recognized the HA stalk domain of a cH5/1 HA
construct (Fig. 3b, c). We also tested the durability of antibody
responses in this experiment, and found that anti-HA antibody
levels remained unchanged over 30 weeks post-vaccination, and,
in fact, the stalk responses were stronger compared to 4 weeks
post-immunization (Fig. 3).
Durable, protective responses toward the HA require CD4+ T
cell functions23, thus we examined CD4+ T cell responses after

 nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP vaccination. Mice were immu-
nized with a single 30 µg dose of A/California/07/2009 HA-
encoding mRNA-LNPs i.d. and CD4+ T cell responses were
determined 12 days later. As a comparator, a group of mice were
immunized with 3 µg of monovalent A/California/07/2009 virus
vaccine. Unlike inactivated virus immunization, HA mRNA-LNP
vaccination induced HA-specific CD4+ T cell responses as
measured by intracellular cytokine production (Supplementary
Fig. 2).
HA stalk-reactive antibody responses in rabbits and ferrets. To
further evaluate the potency of the nucleoside-modified mRNA-
LNP influenza virus vaccine, immunogenicity was also evaluated
in rabbits and ferrets. Rabbits were i.d. immunized twice with
50 µg of A/California/07/2009 HA mRNA-LNPs and antibody
responses were evaluated. A single immunization elicited HAI
titers ranging from 1:120 to 1:320, as well as, HA stalk-specific
antibody responses (Supplementary Fig. 3). A second immuni-
zation significantly boosted antibody responses and resulted in
increased HAI titers and stalk-specific antibodies (Supplementary
Fig. 3).
Next, we evaluated the nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP
influenza virus vaccine in a ferret model. Animals were
immunized i.m. twice with 60 µg of A/California/07/2009 HA
mRNA-LNPs. Antibodies against the HA globular head domain
were elicited in 8 out of 12 ferrets (≥1:40 HAI in all responders)
4 weeks after the first immunization as measured by HAI assays
(Fig. 4a). Substantially increased HAI titers (≥1:160 in 10 out of
12 animals) were obtained after the boost. No HAI activity
against
the heterologous
asH1N1
(A/swine/Jiangsu/40/2011,
Supplementary Fig. 4) virus was detected (Fig. 4b). Importantly,
animals generated HA stalk-reactive antibodies that bound to the
cH6/1 HA protein (Fig. 4c). Moreover, as measured by in vitro
microneutralization (MN) experiments, sera obtained from
ferrets 4 weeks after the first and 9 weeks after the second
immunization neutralized the closely related pH1N1 (A/Nether-
lands/602/2009) and the more antigenically distant asH1N1 virus
(Supplementary Fig. 5).
Collectively, these studies indicate that nucleoside-modified
HA mRNA-LNP vaccines elicit high levels of antibodies against
both the HA head and stalk domains of influenza virus in mice,
rabbits, and ferrets.
Protection from homologous and heterologous viruses in mice.
To investigate the protective efficacy of mRNA immunization,
mice that were immunized with two i.d. or i.m. doses of A/
California/07/2009 HA mRNA-LNPs were challenged with the
homologous A/California/07/2009 H1N1 virus or the hetero-
logous A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 virus 5 weeks after the last
immunization. Both challenge viruses possessed A/Puerto Rico/8/
1934 internal genes and the A/California/7/2009 HA possessed a
D225G mutation to facilitate viral replication in mice. All HA
mRNA-LNP-vaccinated animals were protected from both the
homologous (Fig. 5a, b) and heterologous H1N1 virus infection
(Fig. 5c, d), although some initial weight loss in the low dose
groups was observed after challenge with the A/Puerto Rico/8/
1934 virus (Fig. 5c). Mice injected with control poly(C) RNA-
LNP lost weight and died or needed to be euthanized after viral
challenge (Fig. 5).
Based on the high HAI titers and measurable HA stalk-reactive
antibody responses elicited by the mRNA-LNP constructs, we
hypothesized that a single HA mRNA-LNP immunization could
elicit protective immunity. Mice were i.m. immunized with a
single dose of 30 µg of A/California/07/2009 HA mRNA-LNPs or
30 µg of poly(C) RNA-LNPs. As a comparator, a group of mice
were immunized with 3 µg of monovalent A/California/07/2009
virus vaccine. Four weeks after vaccination, mRNA-LNP vaccines
induced HAI titers ranging between 320–960 against the
autologous strain, whereas the monovalent virus vaccine elicited
very low HAI titers of ~1:15 (Fig. 6a). No HAI activity against the
PR8 virus was detected (Fig. 6a). High antibody titers elicited
by the mRNA-LNP vaccine were associated with protection

viral

 California/07/2009 virus infection; however, animals in both
groups lost a substantial amount of weight following infection
(Fig. 6b). mRNA-LNP-immunized animals displayed weight loss
following
A/Puerto
Rico/8/1934
virus
challenge,
but
they
rapidly recovered and survived virus infection (Fig. 6c). In
contrast, mice that were immunized with the monovalent
A/California/07/2009 virus vaccine or the poly(C) RNA-LNP
vaccine rapidly developed symptoms and 100% of the animals
died following A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 virus challenge (Fig. 6c).
These data demonstrate that a single mRNA-LNP immunization
induced protection from an antigenically distant H1 virus
(Supplementary Fig. 1) in the absence of HAI activity to this
viral HA.
Protection from a heterosubtypic virus in mice. We next per-
formed a series of studies with an H5N1 influenza virus to
determine
whether

mRNA-LNP
immunization elicits protective immune responses against more
antigenically distant influenza virus subtypes. Mice were immu-
nized twice with 30 µg of A/California/07/2009 HA mRNA-LNPs
i.d. or 1 µg (total protein) of inactivated H5N1 influenza virus i.
m.24. Mice were then challenged with a lethal dose of H5N1 virus
(6:2 reassortant between A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 and A/Vietnam/
1203/04, which donated HA and neuraminidase) 4 weeks after
the second immunization and weight and morbidity were mon-
itored for 14 days. Strikingly, all HA mRNA-LNP-immunized
animals survived viral challenge, while those injected with poly
(C) RNA-LNP needed to be euthanized (Fig. 7a). As expected, no
measurable HAI activity against the H5N1 virus was observed in
mice immunized with the A/California/07/2009 HA mRNA-LNP
vaccine (Fig. 7b). Interestingly, sera from these animals also did
not display neutralization activity against the H5N1 virus in
in vitro MN experiments (Fig. 7c).
Discussion
Currently approved influenza virus vaccines offer protection
against well-matched circulating strains. These regimens mostly
elicit antibody responses against the continuously changing
immunodominant globular HA head domain. There is a need to
develop “universal” influenza virus vaccines that induce potent
immune responses against conserved viral epitopes and offer
protection from heterologous and heterosubtypic strains. There
are several viral protein regions that are conserved among dif-
ferent influenza virus strains, including epitopes in the HA stalk
domain, neuraminidase, the ectodomain of the ion channel M2,
matrix protein, and nucleoprotein (reviewed in refs. 25,26). Vac-
cines against these targets might be able to elicit broad and
protective influenza virus-specific immune responses (reviewed in
ref. 1). One of the most extensively studied targets is the immu-
nosubdominant HA stalk (reviewed in ref. 27). Seasonal influenza
vaccines elicit poor antibody responses against HA stalk28,29 in
most individuals; thus, the development of new vaccine platforms

 and optimized immunogens that specifically elicit antibodies
against this region is critically important.
Previous studies, using stable, headless HA proteins3,4 or cHA-
encoding DNA and proteins (prime-boost)6 demonstrated that
HA stalk-specific antibodies can be elicited in mice and ferrets.
Yassine and colleagues developed headless H1 HA immunogens
and demonstrated that three immunizations elicited protective
antibodies against H5N1 influenza virus in mice and ferrets3.
Impagliazzo
and
coworkers
generated
various
monomeric,
dimeric, and trimeric headless H1 mini HAs and showed that
three immunizations with the best working trimeric construct
resulted in protection against an H5N1 virus in mice4, and potent
antibody responses in cynomolgus monkeys. Ermler and collea-
gues designed cHAs with HA heads from various influenza A
viruses and HA stalks from influenza B viruses6. Sequential
vaccination (one DNA prime and two protein boosts) with these
constructs resulted in protection from influenza B viruses in mice.
A recent study from the same laboratory used sequential
immunization in ferrets and demonstrated protection from
pandemic H1N1 virus challenge7.
Here, we evaluated the efficacy of a newly developed influenza
virus vaccine using nucleoside-modified, FPLC-purified full-
length HA-encoding mRNA encapsulated in LNPs30. A single

 LNPs resulted in ≥1:120 A/California/07/2009 HAI titers at
4 weeks post-immunization in mice. A second dose induced HAI
values ranging between 1280–20,480 depending on the dose and
the route of delivery (Fig. 1a, b). Of note, vaccination with A/
California/07/2009 mRNA-LNPs did not generate HAI activity
against the A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 influenza virus (Fig. 1c,
d); however, the vaccine protected animals from A/Puerto Rico/8/
1934 influenza virus challenge (Fig. 5c, d). This protection was
likely mediated by HA stalk-reactive antibody responses that were
measurable after a single immunization, and which were boosted
by a subsequent immunization (Fig. 2).
A critical finding of this report is that a single immunization
with A/California/07/2009 HA mRNA-LNPs resulted in protec-
tion against the homologous A/California/07/2009 and the
heterologous A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 virus challenge in mice
(Fig. 6b, c). Furthermore, we found that two immunizations with
the A/California/07/2009 HA mRNA-LNP vaccine induced pro-
tection against H5N1 influenza virus infection (Fig. 7a). Of note,
sera from these animals did not neutralize the challenge virus in
in vitro MN experiments (Fig. 7c), which suggests a contribution
of other effector immune mechanisms to heterosubtypic vaccine
protection. These findings are in accordance with the literature as
several recent studies demonstrated that the potency of HA stalk-
specific antibodies were often enhanced by Fc receptor-mediated
mechanisms
such
as
antibody-dependent
cell-mediated
cytotoxicity or complement-dependent cytotoxicity31–34. Future
studies will determine the correlates of protection after mRNA-
LNP influenza vaccine administration. Several mRNA-based
influenza
vaccines
have
been
described
in
recent
years
(reviewed in ref. 35). For example, Bahl and colleagues demon-
strated that a similar mRNA-LNP vaccine platform (using
nucleoside-modified but not FPLC-purified H7 and H10 HA
mRNAs) induced protection against the homologous influenza
virus after a single dose immunization in mice and ferrets;
however, no heterologous challenge data or evidence for the
presence of stalk-specific antibodies was evaluated in these stu-
dies18. Another recent report using unmodified HA mRNA-LNPs
demonstrated durable induction of HA-specific antibodies in
non-human primates, but again, the generation of cross-
protective HA stalk antibodies was not reported36.
Ferrets are one of the best animal models for influenza virus
research; however, a potential limitation of the use of ferrets for
antiserum generation is that they usually generate more focused
antibody responses to the variable head regions of HA than
humans after natural infection37,38. We demonstrated that a
single i.m. immunization with the A/California/07/2009 mRNA-
LNP vaccine elicited ≥1:40 HAI activity against the A/California/
07/2009 virus in 8 out of 12 animals 4 weeks after vaccination
(Fig. 4a). A subsequent immunization resulted in ≥1:160 HAI
titers in 10 out of 12 A/California/07/2009 HA mRNA-LNP-

 immunized ferrets. The high variability in HAI activity may be
due to the genetic heterogeneity of the out-bred animals, and thus
it is possible that in some ferrets mRNA-LNP immunization
skewed immune responses toward epitopes that neutralize viruses
but do not induce HAI titers (Fig. 4a). The presence of stalk-
reactive antibodies (Fig. 4c) and MN titers against the homo-
logous and heterologous H1N1 strains in A/California/07/2009
HA mRNA-LNP-immunized animals (Supplementary Fig. 5)
support this hypothesis. Additionally, rabbits were immunized
with the A/California/07/2009 HA mRNA-LNP vaccine and
found that a single immunization elicited HA stalk-reactive
antibodies (Supplementary Fig. 3), demonstrating that our find-
ings in mice were translated to two species of large animals.
Here, we demonstrate that the nucleoside-modified, FPLC-
purified influenza virus HA-encoding mRNA-LNP vaccine eli-
cited HA stalk-specific antibody responses in mice, rabbits, and
ferrets with durable HA stalk titers in mice. Future studies will
address if mRNA-LNP immunization preferentially induce HA
stalk-specific responses or they are elicited as a consequence of
the very potent immune response without refocusing the
immunodominance. Additional studies using adoptive serum
transfer and T cell depletions will further evaluate the contribu-
tion of stalk-specific antibodies to vaccine protection in the het-
erosubtypic influenza virus infection model. The mRNA-LNP
vaccine platform has additional beneficial features over other
vaccines, including a favorable safety profile and highly scalable
and potentially inexpensive manufacture. In addition to potency,
from an influenza virus vaccine perspective, the most critical
advantages of the present platform are the rapid development
and the ease of production. It is notable that these vaccines
are not subject to cell culture and egg-adaptive mutations
that commonly arise as conventional influenza virus vaccines
are manufactured39,40. The use of the nucleoside-modified
mRNA-LNP
platform
with
optimized
HA
stalk-inducing
immunogens3,4,7 may offer a superior platform with easy clin-
ical use. Currently available seasonal influenza virus vaccines do
not protect well against antigenically drifted viral strains and they
likely provide very little protection against emerging pandemic
strains. Production of conventional, FDA-approved vaccines
against new pandemic viruses could take at least 6 months,
leaving the population unprotected during this period1. On the
contrary, once the genetic sequence of the target HA antigen is
known, mRNA-LNP vaccines can potentially be produced
within weeks (reviewed in ref. 12). mRNA-LNP vaccine produc-
tion is sequence-independent and can be applied to virtually
any pathogen. We believe that the data presented in this
report combined with the additional beneficial features of
nucleoside-modified and purified mRNA-LNPs makes the pre-
sent platform a viable broadly protective influenza virus vaccine
candidate.
Methods
Ethics statement. The investigators faithfully adhered to the “Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals” by the Committee on Care of Laboratory Animal
Resources Commission on Life Sciences, National Research Council. The animal
facilities at the University of Pennsylvania, The Wistar Institute, the Icahn School
of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Noble Life Sciences vivarium are fully accredited
by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. All
studies were conducted under protocols approved by the University of Pennsyl-
vania, Noble Life Sciences, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and The
Wistar Institute IACUCs. The Wistar IACUC does not use weight loss as a criteria
for euthanasia in murine influenza virus experiments.
mRNA production. mRNAs were produced as previously described41 using T7 RNA
polymerase (Megascript, Ambion) on linearized plasmids (synthesized by GenScript)
encoding codon-optimized42 Puerto Rico/8/1934 influenza virus HA (pTEV-PR8
HA-A101), A/California/7/2009 influenza virus hemmaglutinin (pTEV-A/Cal09 HA-
A101), and firefly luciferase (pTEV-Luc-A101). mRNAs were transcribed to contain
101 nucleotide-long poly(A) tails. One-methylpseudouridine (m1Ψ)-5′-triphosphate
(TriLink) instead of UTP was used to generate modified nucleoside-containing
mRNA. RNAs were capped using the m7G capping kit with 2′-O-methyltransferase
(ScriptCap, CellScript) to obtain cap1. mRNA was purified by FPLC (Akta Purifier,
GE Healthcare), as described43. All mRNAs were analyzed by denaturing or native
agarose gel electrophoresis and were stored frozen at −20 °C.
LNP formulation of the mRNA. FPLC-purified m1Ψ-containing firefly luciferase
and influenza virus HA-encoding mRNAs and poly(C) RNA (Sigma) were
encapsulated in LNPs using a self-assembly process in which an aqueous solution
of mRNA at pH = 4.0 is rapidly mixed with a solution of lipids dissolved in
ethanol44. LNPs used in this study were similar in composition to those described
previously44,45, which contain an ionizable cationic lipid (proprietary to Acuitas)/
phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol/PEG-lipid (50:10:38.5:1.5 mol/mol) and were
encapsulated at an RNA to total lipid ratio of ~0.05 (wt/wt). They had a diameter of
~80 nm as measured by dynamic light scattering using a Zetasizer Nano ZS
(Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern, UK) instrument. mRNA-LNP formulations
were stored at −80 °C at a concentration of mRNA of ~1 μg/μl.
Immunization of mice, rabbits, and ferrets. Mice: Female BALB/c mice aged
8 weeks were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. mRNA-LNPs were
diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and injected into animals intradermally
with a 3/10cc 29½G insulin syringe (BD Biosciences). Four sites of injection (30 µl
each) over the lower back were used. For intramuscular injections, mRNA-LNPs
were diluted in PBS and injected into animals using a 3/10cc 29½G insulin syringe.
Monovalent A/California/7/2009 virus vaccine (3 µg in 50 µl) (BEI Resources, NR-
20347) and inactivated A/Vietnam/1203/04 virus vaccine (1 µg in 50 µl) (the virus
was grown in eggs and inactivated with 0.3% formalin) were intramuscularly
injected into the quadriceps muscle of animals using a 3/10cc 29½G insulin syr-
inge. Inactivated H5N1 whole-virus vaccine preparation was generated by con-
centration of A/Vietnam/1203/04 virus (vaccine strain, 6:2 re-assortant with PR8,
polybasic cleavage site of HA was removed) via ultracentrifugation followed by
inactivation with 0.03% formalin. Protein content was measured using the Brad-
ford method and reflects total protein rather than HA concentration.
Rabbits: Female New Zealand White rabbits aged 6 weeks were purchased from
Charles River Laboratories. mRNA-LNPs were diluted in PBS and injected into
animals intradermally with a 3/10cc 29G syringe (BD Biosciences). Six sites of
injection (45 µl each) over the lower back were used.
Ferrets: 7–10-week-old male and female ferrets were purchased from Triple F
Farms Inc. mRNA-LNPs were diluted in PBS and injected intramuscularly into the
upper thigh (100 µl).
Blood collection. Mice: Blood was collected prior to each immunization by sub-
mandibular bleeding. Blood was centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 × g in an Eppendorf
microcentrifuge and the serum was stored at −80 °C and used for ELISA, MN, and
HAI assays.
Rabbits: Blood was obtained from the lateral saphenous vein under anesthesia.
Blood was centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 × g and the serum was stored at −80 °C
and used for ELISA and HAI assays.
Ferrets: Blood was obtained from the vena cava under anesthesia. Blood was
centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 × g and the serum was stored at −80 °C and used for
ELISA, MN, and HAI assays.
Antibody reagents for flow cytometry. The following antibodies were used for
flow cytometry: anti-CD4 PerCP/Cy5.5 (Clone GK1.5, BioLegend), anti-CD3 APC-
Cy7 (Clone 145-2C11, BD Biosciences), anti-TNF-α PE-Cy7 (Clone MP6-XT22,
BD Biosciences), anti-IFN-γ AF700 (Clone XMG1.2, BD Biosciences), anti-IL-2
APC (Clone JES6-5H4, BD Biosciences).
Mouse splenocyte stimulation/staining and flow cytometry. Single cell sus-
pensions from mouse spleens were made in complete medium. Splenocytes were
washed once in PBS and resuspended in complete medium at 2 × 107 cells/ml. 2 ×
106 cells (100 µl) per sample were stimulated for 6 h at 37 °C using two overlapping
influenza virus HA (A/California/07/2009) peptide pools (peptides are 14-mers or
15-mers, with 11 amino acid overlaps, provided by BEI resources, NR-19244) at
2 µg/ml per peptide. Golgi Plug (brefeldin A, BD Biosciences) and Golgi Stop
(monensin, BD Biosciences) were diluted 1:100 and 1:143 in complete medium,
respectively, and 20 µl from both were added to each sample to inhibit the secretion
of intracellular cytokines after 1 h of stimulation. A PMA (10 ng/ml)-ionomycin
(250 ng/ml) (Sigma) stimulated sample and unstimulated samples for each animal
were included.
After stimulation, cells were washed in PBS and stained using the LIVE/DEAD
Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain Kit and then surface stained for CD4 (2 µg/ml).
Antibodies were incubated with cells for 30 min at RT. Following surface staining,
cells were washed in FACS buffer and fixed using the Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD
Biosciences), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Following fixation, the
cells were washed in the permeabilization buffer and incubated with antibodies
against CD3 (1.6 µg/ml), TNF-α (1.6 µg/ml), IFN-γ (4 µg/ml), and IL-2 (4 µg/ml)
for 1 h at RT. Following staining, the cells were washed with the permeabilization

 buffer, fixed (PBS containing 1% paraformaldehyde) and stored at 4 °C until
analysis. Splenocytes were analyzed on a modified LSR II flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences).
Recombinant influenza virus cHAs. Recombinant HAs including H1 HAs of A/
California/04/09 and A/Puerto Rico/8/34 and chimeric cH6/1Calss (an H6 head
domain from A/mallard/Sweden/81/02 on top of an H1 stalk domain from A/
California/04/09 with a stabilizing mutation in the stalk domain) and cH5/1PR8 (an
H5 head domain from A/Vietnam/1203/04 on top of an H1 stalk domain from A/
Puerto Rico/8/34) constructs were expressed in the baculovirus expression system,
as previously described46–48. They were then purified via a hexahistidine tag and
Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) resin.
Influenza virus challenge studies. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and
intranasally challenged with 200,000 TCID50 of A/California/07/2009 influenza
virus (6:2 virus with 6 A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 internal genes and A/California/07/
2009 HA and NA) or 5000 TCID50 of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 influenza virus in 50 µl
PBS. The A/California/7/2009 HA possessed a D225G mutation to facilitate viral
replication in mice.
H5N1 challenges were performed with a 6:2 A/Vietnam/1203/04 reassortant
virus (6 A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 internal genes and A/Vietnam/1203/04 HA and NA
with the polybasic cleavage site removed from the HA). Animals were anesthetized
using ketamine/xylazine (0.15 mg ketamine and 0.03 mg xylazine) delivered
intraperitoneally in a volume of 100 µl. The mice were then inoculated with 50 µl of
a virus dilution (in PBS) containing 5 murine 50% lethal doses (mLD50) of virus.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. ELISA plates were coated overnight at
4 °C with 3 µg/ml of recombinant protein. ELISA plates were blocked with a 3%
(w/vol) bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution in PBS for 2 h. Plates were then
washed three times with PBS-Tween20 (0.1%) and serial dilutions of sera (diluted
in 1% BSA in PBS) were added to the plates. After 2 h of incubation, plates were
washed and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated or horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-
conjugated secondary antibodies were added. After a 1 h incubation, plates were
washed and a p-nitrophenyl phosphate or a 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)
substrate (Seracare, product number 50-00-03) was added. For HRP-based ELISAs,
HCl was then added to stop the TMB reaction, and absorbance at 405 nm was
measured using a plate reader. Results were obtained from technical duplicates.
HAI assays. A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 and A/California/07/2009 HAI assays: Mouse
sera were heat-treated for 30 min at 55 °C. Ferret sera were treated with receptor
destroying enzyme (RDE) from Vibrio cholerae (Denka Seiken, Chuo-ku, Tokyo,
Japan) for 2 h at 37 °C and then heat-treated for 30 min at 55 °C. Rabbit sera were
RDE-treated for 2 h at 37 °C, heat-treated for 30 min at 55 °C, and then absorbed
with turkey erythrocytes. Titrations were performed in 96-well round bottom plates
(BD Biosciences). First, 5 µl of sera were added to 95 µl of PBS (1:20 dilution), then
two-fold serial dilutions were performed up to 1:2560 in a volume of 50 µl. Next,
four agglutinating doses of virus were added to a total volume of 100 µl. Finally,
12.5 µl of turkey erythrocytes (Lampire) (2% (vol/vol) solution) was added to each
well, and mixed thoroughly. Agglutination was read after incubating for 1 h at RT.
HAI titers were expressed as the inverse of the highest dilution that inhibited four
agglutinating doses of influenza virus.
A/swine/Jiangsu/40/2011 and A/Vietnam/1203/04 HAI assays: Mouse and
ferret sera were treated with three volumes (based on original sera volume) of RDE
for 18 h at 37 °C. Three volumes (based on original serum volume) of 2.5% sodium
citrate solution was then added to the RDE-treated serum samples and were then
incubated at 56 °C for 1 h. Three volumes of PBS (based on original serum volume)
were added to each sample for a final dilution of 1:10. Titrations were performed in
96-well round bottom plates (BD Biosciences). First, 50 µl of RDE-treated serum
was added to the first well, then two-fold serial dilutions were performed up to
1:2048. Next, eight agglutinating doses of virus were added to a total volume of
50 µl. Virus and sera were then incubated at RT for 30 min with shaking. Following
this incubation, 50 µl of chicken erythrocytes (Charles River Laboratories) (0.5%
(vol/vol) solution) was added to each well, and mixed thoroughly. Agglutination
was read after incubating for 1 h at 4 °C. HAI titers were expressed as the inverse of
the highest dilution that inhibited four agglutinating doses of influenza virus.
All samples were run in at least technical duplicates. The challenge virus strains
(detailed in “Influenza virus challenge studies”) were used for HAI assays.
MN assays. Mouse and ferret sera were treated with three volumes (based on
original sera volume) of RDE for 18 h at 37 °C. Three volumes (based on original
serum volume) of 2.5% sodium citrate solution was then added to the RDE-treated
serum samples and were then incubated at 56 °C for 1 h. Three volumes of PBS (based
on original serum volume) were added to each sample for a final dilution of 1:10.
Madin–Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC number PTA-6500)
maintained in complete Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium with the addition of
10% fetal bovine serum, 1% Pen/Strep, 1% of a 1 M HEPES stock solution were
plated at a concentration of 1.5 × 104 cells per well in a 96-well plate and left to
grow overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2 until they reached 80–90% confluency.
RDE-treated sera was serially diluted two-fold in 1× minimal essential medium
(MEM; 10% 10× MEM, 1% 200 mM L-glutamine, 1.6% of a 7.5% sodium
bicarbonate stock solution (pH 7.5), 1% of a 1 M 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-
piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) stock solution, 1% of penicillin/
streptomycin antibiotic cocktail (Pen/Strep, Gibco), 0.6% of a 35% BSA stock
solution) containing 1 µg/ml L-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone
(TPCK)-treated trypsin. For ferret sera, half of the volume of the serial dilutions
was incubated with 100×TCID50 of each virus (at a 1:1 volume ratio) for 1 h at RT
with shaking. The virus-sera mixture was then applied to 80–90% confluent MDCK
cells after they had been washed one time with sterile, 1×PBS. The cells were then
incubated with the virus-sera mixture for 1 h at 33 °C. After the incubation, the
virus-ferret sera mixture was removed, cells were washed with 1×PBS, and then
covered with the remaining half of the serial sera dilutions (supplemented with a
1:1 addition of 1×MEM with 1 µg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin).
For mouse sera, the entire amount of sera was incubated with 50×TCID50 of
H5N1 (at a 1:1 ratio) for 1 h at RT with shaking. The virus-sera mixture was then
applied to 80–90% confluent MDCK cells after they had been washed one time
with sterile 1×PBS. The cells were then incubated with the virus-sera mixture for
3 days at 33 °C. The difference in incubation time for the ferret sera vs. mouse sera
on MDCK cells in these assays was due to the limited volumes of sera from mouse
studies.
All samples were run in at least technical duplicates.
Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree. Sequences of the full-
length HA protein of A/California/04/2009 (pH1N1), A/Michigan/45/2015, A/New
Caledonia/20/1999, A/South Carolina/1/1918, A/swine/Jiangsu/40/2011 (asH1N1),
A/Brisbane/59/2007, A/swine/4/Mexico/2009, A/swine/Aichi/10/2015, A/swine/
Guangxi/QZ5/2014, and A/swine/Ohio/A02216472/2017 were downloaded from
the Global Initiative for Sharing of all Influenza Data (GISAID) and aligned using
the online server, Clustal Omega (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/). The
phylogenetic tree produced from this alignment was downloaded, rooted to A/
South Carolina/1/1918, and visualized using FigTree.
Mapping conservation of pH1N1 and asH1N1. The structure used for visualizing
the conserved residues between pH1N1 and asH1N1 is PDB ID 3LZG49. An
alignment of pH1N1 and asH1N1 whole-HA protein sequences (downloaded from
GISAID) was used to determine 100% conserved residues in Chimeria v1.12. These
residues were then mapped onto a monomer of 3LZG in red. The alignment of
pH1N1 and asH1N1 was also uploaded to the LALIGN server (https://embnet.
vital-it.ch/software/LALIGN_form.html) to determine percent identity and simi-
larity between the two HA proteins.
Statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were performed with Excel and Prism 5.0f
software. Data were compared using one-way and two-way ANOVA corrected for
multiple comparisons (Bonferroni method) and unpaired t-test. Survival analyses
were perfomed using the log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test. The A/California/07/2009
crystal structure (PDB ID 3UBN) was visualized using PyMOL software.
Data availability. All data are available within the article and its Supplementary
Information file or from the authors upon request.
