Abstract
Lymphoid tissue is a key reservoir established by HIV-1 during acute infection. It is a site of viral 
production, storage of viral particles in immune complexes, and viral persistence. Whilst 
combinations of antiretroviral drugs usually suppress viral replication and reduce viral RNA to 
undetectable levels in blood, it is unclear whether treatment fully suppresses viral replication in 
lymphoid tissue reservoirs. Here we show that virus evolution and trafficking between tissue 
compartments continues in patients with undetectable levels of virus in their bloodstream. A 
spatial dynamic model of persistent viral replication and spread explains why the development of 
drug resistance is not a foregone conclusion under conditions where drug concentrations are 
insufficient to completely block virus replication. These data provide fresh insights into the 
evolutionary and infection dynamics of the virus population within the host, revealing that HIV-1 
can continue to replicate and refill the viral reservoir despite potent antiretroviral therapy.
Combinations of antiretroviral drugs routinely cripple HIV-1 production and replication to 
levels undetectable in the blood within weeks of starting treatment1. None of the current 
treatments, however, are capable of eradicating the virus from a long-lived reservoir in 
resting memory CD4+ T cells and other potential cell types that insulate the virus from 
antiretroviral drugs or immune surveillance2-5. Intermittent virus production from 
reactivation of a small proportion of latently infected CD4+ T cells (rather than low levels of 
ongoing replication) is thought to drive viral rebound detected in blood of well-suppressed 
patients on treatment6-8. Ongoing replication is considered unlikely because neither viral

 genetic divergence over time, nor the emergence of drug resistance mutations have been 
convincingly documented9,10. As earlier studies only examined viral sequences derived from 
the blood of patients who continued to suppress viral replication in that anatomic 
compartment11, the conclusions are not necessarily generalizable to other compartments in 
the body, particularly to lymphoid tissue where the frequency of infection per cell is mostly 
higher12 and the intracellular drug concentrations are much lower than in blood13. Under 
low drug concentrations, the virus may continue to replicate and evolve in sanctuary sites 
within the reservoir of cells in lymphoid tissue, and remain undetectable in the bloodstream 
for a time depending on viral population migration dynamics between the two 
compartments. Here we use a multi-pronged strategy of deep-sequencing, time-calibrated 
phylogenetic analysis, and mathematical modeling to characterize the distinct temporal 
structure and divergence of compartmentally sampled viral sequences. We discover ongoing 
replication in lymphoid tissue sanctuaries of patients despite undetectable blood levels of 
virus. Our sampling approach differs fundamentally from those of previous studies14-16, 
which do not address evolutionary dynamics within lymphoid tissue, and better suits 
investigation of the dynamic nature of the viral reservoir during treatment with potent 
antiretroviral drugs.
HIV-1 sequence determination
To investigate the evolution and spatial dispersion of virus with high accuracy, we deep 
sequenced (using the Roche 454 Sciences’ GS-FLX sequencing platform) HIV-1 DNA in 
cells from blood and inguinal lymph nodes collected from three subjects at three separate 
times (at day 0, and after 3 and 6 months of treatment) described elsewhere13. Previous work 
established that viral sequences contemporaneously sampled from lymphoid tissue in 
different locations are genetically homogeneous17, consistent with CD4+ T cell homing and 
trafficking18. Consequently, detailed assessment of a portion of a solitary lymph node is no 
more susceptible to bias than wider anatomical sampling. We also sequenced viral RNA in 
the plasma (day 0) from these three study subjects. Two subjects (1727 and 1679) had well-
suppressed infections (< 48 copies/mL of plasma); and the third subject (1774) continued to 
have measureable amounts of viral RNA in plasma after 3, but not 6, months of treatment 
(Extended Data Fig. 1). Subjects 1727 and 1679 were each infected with HIV-1 for 
approximately 3 to 4 months and were antiretroviral drug naïve before the study. Subject 
1774 was infected with HIV-1 for approximately 17 years and was antiretroviral-therapy 
experienced, but had not received any treatment for at least 1 year prior to the study.
We aligned individual reads with an average length of 548bp to a consensus sequence using 
reference-guided assembly, and corrected sequencing errors for potentially inflated estimates 
of genetic diversity19. We then used a previously described approach20 to reconstruct the 
minimum number of viral haplotypes needed to adequately explain the observed reads. We 
calculated the sequencing error rate and set the cut-off for the subsequent analyses using a 
known internal control sequence. We found no significant evidence for recombinant 
sequences that could bias the analysis. High coverage enabled us to correct PCR and 
sequencing errors (leaving an average 25,000 final long-reads per sample) to detect variants 
present in at least 0.04% of the virus population (see Methods). The sequences from the Pol 
region of HIV-1 that spanned the genomic region encoding the viral enzymes protease or

 reverse transcriptase showed no evidence of new mutations that confer resistance to the 
particular antiretroviral drug used (data not shown).
To avoid uncertainties in the haplotype detection due to sparse sampling and prevent 
systematically biased evolutionary analyses, we established a higher number of template 
molecules than the depth of the sequence data by a median 9.6 fold (range 3.2 to 362 fold). 
The high coverage of ultra deep sequencing ensured reliable detection of low-frequency viral 
variants (see Methods). In support of this conclusion, we found limited variability across 
inferred haplotypes in two completely independent technical replicates made from the same 
RNA or DNA sample at each time point from each subject using the same procedures 
(average Spearman rank correlations coefficient between single nucleotide polymorphism 
frequencies across replicates of ρ = 0.832, interquartile range across samples, ρ = 0.820 to 
0.851; 93.7% of haplotypes above 1% frequency appeared above 1% frequency in the 
replicate; 97.7% of haplotypes below 1% frequency appeared below 1% frequency in the 
replicate), indicating that the haplotype representation is not notably biased from random 
amplification of some sequences and not others. The high degree of concordance between 
technical replicates validated our approach for the computational characterization of the 
viral populations, which is robust with respect to experimental error and stochastic effect20.
Phylogenies show temporal structure
The inferred haplotypes corresponding to the Gag or Pol regions of HIV-1 were subjected to 
maximum-likelihood methods of phylogeny estimation (Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3). We 
masked out the guanosines in the APOBEC3 trinucleotide contexts of the edited sites from 
the alignments to avoid distortion and retain the phylogenetic information20 (Extended Data 
Figs. 2 and 3). Phylogenetic relationships between the distinct haplotypes showed a temporal 
structure consistent with the molecular clock (continuing nucleotide substitutions occurring 
at a constant rate), as evidenced by strong correlation between root-to-tip distance and 
sampling date in the regression analyses (despite the short branches). Branch support 
computed using an approximate likelihood ratio test and the proportion of sites that are 
different (p-distance) verify the divergence of haplotypes between day 0 and after 6 months 
of treatment in most of the Gag and Pol regions of HIV-1 analyzed (Extended Data Table 1). 
Consistent with ongoing replication rather than sampling of different virus populations in 
lymph nodes, viral sequences contemporaneously sampled from lymphoid tissue and blood 
showed a similar degree of divergence. With removal of the haplotypes found to harbor 
repetitive inactivating base substitutions of guanosine-to-adenosine (G-to-A) the 
evolutionary lineage emerged that lead up to the APOBEC3-mediated hypermutation event, 
and the evolutionary rate estimates (range, 6.24 × 10−4 to 1.02 × 10−3 substitutions per site 
per month; Extended Data Table 2) are consistent with those of intra-host virus estimations 
(range, 5.22 × 10−4 to 8.42 × 10−4 substitutions per site per month)21. We therefore conclude 
that continued virus replication contributes to the viral reservoir.
Genetic differentiation due to migration
The pairwise fixation index (FST), a standard measure of genetic differentiation between 
populations, confirmed significant genetic variation between lymph node and blood at each

 time point (Extended Data Table 3)22,23. Because FST measures of population structure 
among sampled haplotypes in spatially distinct compartments can be affected by selection 
and migration, we used an unrestricted branch-site random effects model to test whether the 
proportion of sites along the branches of the phylogeny significantly differ among lineages, 
indicating episodic diversifying selection24 (see Methods and Extended Data Table 4). We 
restricted the test to internal branches, which capture at least one and likely multiple rounds 
of virus replication, to mitigate the biasing effects of neutral or deleterious mutations on the 
ratio of nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitution rates (ω) estimates where selection has 
not yet fully filtered such population level variation25,26. Except for one study subject 
(1679), where a small proportion of sites (0.3%) were under strong diversifying positive 
selection along internal tree branches (likelihood ratio test, P~10−6), we found scarce 
evidence to suggest the virus is evolving in response to strong selective forces. We 
concluded that the FST values are more likely due to migration of haplotypes from one 
compartment to another.
The phyloanatomic history of HIV-1
To infer evolutionary patterns and population dynamic processes from the time-structured 
sequence data, we used a Bayesian statistical framework that estimates the substitution rate, 
divergence time, and demographic history of the sampled viral lineages to structure-rooted, 
time-resolved phylogenies27,28 (see Methods). This approach resolves evolutionary patterns 
to infer the timing and direction of the key migrations of the virus within hosts. Figure 1 
shows the phyloanatomic history of HIV-1 within the study subjects inferred from the 
ancestral and descendent haplotypes on a Bayesian maximum clade credibility (MCC) 
phylogenetic tree. The branching patterns in the trees, which reconstruct the origins and 
trace the flow of HIV-1 within hosts, and the tissue of origin of the internal nodes, show 
strong statistical support (highlighted by their posterior probabilities). Branch lengths in 
these time-structured trees (left panels with all haplotypes; right panels with the putative G-
to-A hypermutant sequences removed to avoid distortion) represent posterior median 
estimates of calendar time. The temporal structure in the trees shows a strong clock-like 
signal and rates consistent with HIV-1 within-host evolution. The best-fit model included a 
strict molecular clock and assumed a constant population size, though a model with a 
relaxed molecular clock gave qualitatively similar results (data not shown).
Based on inferred MCC tree topologies and the compartment assignments to unobserved 
internal nodes, an underlying conformity and strong correlation exist between genetic and 
anatomic locations and the direction of the virus's spread in the body. A particular pattern 
recurs: the haplotypes in lymph nodes are the source of viral lineages that migrate from 
lymph node to blood (Fig. 1). We deduce that viral lineages in blood are derived from 
replicating virus in lymph nodes with little or no evidence of an additional source in blood. 
The time-scaled trees show a strong and significant result and are robust to different 
substitution models (see Methods). These data, only revealed through temporarily and 
spatially resolved sampling, further support the conclusion that the pattern does not result 
from distinct populations of haplotypes being sampled from different compartments, but 
rather migration and colonization of haplotypes between lymphoid tissue and blood. A 
structured coalescent model29, less prone to potential bias in spatial inference estimates,

 shows higher migration rates from lymph node to blood (Extended Data Table 5), 
confirming that the direction of flow is not due to oversampling of a particular anatomic 
location that would have increased estimates of traffic into that location30.
Our results, which reconstruct the dynamics of HIV-1 spread within the body, imply that in 
patients with no detectable viral RNA in plasma, the virus reservoir is constantly replenished 
by low-level virus replication in lymphoid tissue. Distinguishing between low amounts of 
viral replication and pools of latently infected cells that may persist and rekindle HIV-1 
infection is methodologically difficult. A small number of HIV-1 sequences isolated at 
consecutive time points that persisted without evidence of genetic change might be due to 
long-lived central memory cells, a fraction of which may have reverted to a resting state, or 
latently infected transitional memory cells that persist by clonal expansions (driven by 
homeostatic proliferation) or survivorship for long-lived infected CD4+ T cells that contain 
replication-competent virus8,15,22,31-34. Two of the subjects (1774 and 1679) showed that 
some haplotypes persist as a single tree branch through time (Fig. 1d and f), consistent with 
proliferation of HIV-1 infected cells or long-term cell survival33,34. Regardless of the 
different mechanisms for self-renewal and/or persistence by which some of these quite 
similar latent or defective viral lineages may have persisted, these quiescent viruses differ 
from others that have evolved and trafficked between compartments. The temporally and 
compartmentally sampled data show that viral lineages continue to diverge in well-
suppressed patients and help explain the persistence of infectious viral reservoirs with scant 
decay of the virus pool35. The dynamic nature of the viral population in lymphoid tissue 
sanctuaries, where infected cells can still produce new viruses, infect new target cells and 
replenish the pool, undermines previous estimates of the time necessary to purge the 
reservoir of latently infected cells and achieve virus eradication3.
A spatial dynamic model
Even though viral genetic diversity accumulated over time, the infected cells did not produce 
new virus with drug-resistance mutations, conferring a putative fitness advantage that might 
have led to a systemic viral rebound. To provide a mechanistic explanation of this scenario, 
we developed a drug concentration-dependent mathematical model of virus replication and 
spread between spatially distinct compartments to explore the deterministic components of 
viral dynamics36. In this model (see Fig. 2 and Supplementary Information), the virus can 
occupy two spatially distinct compartments that have limited traffic of virus particles or 
cells. The main compartment has a larger volume and high effective drug concentration. The 
other, smaller volume compartment (<0.01% of the size of the main compartment) has a 
lower drug concentration and represents a sanctuary site within the lymphoid tissue 
reservoir 37. The model includes competition between two viral strains, one that is sensitive 
to a potent multidrug regimen and one that is partially resistant to the full complement of 
antiretroviral drugs, but less fit than the drug-sensitive strain in the absence of treatment. 
Within each compartment the balance between the strains is determined by the difference in 
their replicative fitness without treatment, the effectiveness of drug therapy to curb new 
rounds of infection in that region (determined by drug concentration) and the susceptibility 
of each strain to antiretroviral therapy.

 Figure 3 illustrates a hypothetical fitness landscape, which portrays the relationship between 
the fitness of each strain and the evolutionary adaptation across a range of drug 
concentrations. The fitness landscape illuminates the persistence of the pool of virus that is 
unaffected by antiretroviral drugs. The effective reproductive number R (the average number 
of secondary de novo infections of cells produced by one infected cell) is a function of the 
basic reproductive number R0 and the effectiveness of treatment (R = R0 in the absence of 
treatment). The fitness cost for drug resistance determines the difference between the 
effective reproductive numbers for drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains (RS and RR, 
respectively) at zero effective drug concentration. In a competitive system where both strains 
are present, the maximum of the two effective reproductive numbers RS and RR equals the 
effective reproductive number R for the system as a whole at that effective drug 
concentration.
With two spatial compartments, heterogeneity in the distribution of the drug can lead to 
heterogeneity in R. In the sanctuary site, where drug-penetrance is low, the drug-selective 
pressure on the replicating virus population is too low to compensate for the fitness costs 
associated with resistance; thus, the effective reproductive number for a drug-sensitive strain 
is greater than that of the partially drug-resistant strain (RS > RR), enabling de novo 
infection dominated by the drug-sensitive strain38. As drug effectiveness increases, the 
partially drug-resistant strain gradually becomes more fit relative to the drug-sensitive strain 
such that at some intermediate drug concentrations, characterized by threshold levels, the 
effective reproductive number for the resistant strain can be greater than that for the drug-
sensitive strain (RR > RS). This would allow for de novo infection dominated by the partially 
drug-resistant strain. In our model, however, we assume that drug concentration in the main 
compartment exceeds this threshold. At this high drug concentration, infection is no longer 
sustainable because the effective reproductive numbers are less than unity for both strains 
(RR and RS).
By assuming a relatively simple two-compartment model with drug concentration 
differences between them, the model predicts that virus, dominated by the drug-sensitive 
strain, can proliferate in a small sanctuary site where the drug concentration is low (Fig. 4a). 
Although all single point mutations will be generated sufficiently often to prompt partially 
drug-resistant strains within individuals, their numbers will remain low through competition. 
The likelihood is exceedingly low (see Supplementary Information and Supplementary Table 
2) of stepwise accumulation of mutations from a partially drug-resistant strain to one that 
confers resistance to all drugs, each of which would have to come to fixation in the absence 
of drug selection (Extended Data Fig. 4), or the presence or absence of recombination. The 
model calculations show that increasing drug effectiveness or penetration across spatial 
regions can affect evolutionary dynamics, and lead either to the emergence of drug-resistant 
strains (Fig. 4b) or the elimination of ongoing replication (Fig. 4c). Our model predictions fit 
the data well (Extended Data Fig. 5) and confirm that both competition between strains and 
regional spatial heterogeneity in antiretroviral concentrations help capture the observed 
dynamics of the viral reservoir in these well-suppressed patients.
Though probabilistic models suggest (and this model allows) production of partially drug-
resistant strains, any which arise cannot populate the sanctuary site because of low drug

 penetration and competition from drug-sensitive strains. Equally, they cannot repopulate the 
larger, main compartment where drug concentrations preclude any ongoing replication. In 
agreement with our phylogenetic inferences, these results suggest that the low-level viral 
replication in lymphoid tissues where antiretroviral drugs concentration are low could allow 
drug-sensitive strains to grow and spillover to the blood39.
Conclusion
This study reveals how dynamic and spatial processes work together to permit HIV-1 to 
persist within the infected host and avoid development of resistance despite antiretroviral 
therapy. From these temporally and compartmentally structured sequence data, we conclude 
that continued virus production from infected cells in lymphoid tissue sanctuary sites, where 
drug concentrations are not fully suppressive, can continue to refill the viral reservoir and 
traffic to blood or lymphoid tissue18. We further show that the virus does not inexorably 
develop resistance to antiretroviral drugs because the lower concentrations of drug in the 
sanctuaries are not sufficient to confer a competitive advantage upon drug-resistant strains. 
Our findings explain the failure of treatment intensification to fully suppress de novo 
infection and highlight issues surrounding the barriers to delivering antiretroviral drugs at 
clinically effective concentrations in the infectious viral reservoir. The state-of-the-art 
sequencing approach, innovative time-calibrated phyloanatomic tree construction, and a 
novel model of compartmentalized intra-host population dynamics provide a new 
perspective on HIV-1's seemingly untouchable strongholds in the body. Achieving optimal 
cellular pharmacokinetics and spatial distribution of antiretroviral drugs in lymphoid tissue 
to fully suppress viral replication and preserve immune function is, therefore, a prerequisite 
to the elimination of the viral reservoir and ultimately a cure for HIV-1 infection.
Methods
Study subjects
The three study subjects were enrolled into a clinical protocol where treatment was started 
after we obtained peripheral blood by venipucture, inguinal lymph nodes by excisional 
biopsy, and ileum and rectal biopsies through colonoscopy13. Two subjects were 
antiretroviral drug naïve (1727 and 1679) and one subject (1774) had not received any drugs 
for at least 1 year before enrollment. Subjects 1679 and 1774 received emtricitabine (FTC), 
tenofovir (TFV; as the disoproxil fumarate [TDF]), and atazanavir with ritonavir (ATV/R). 
Subject 1727 received FTC, TDF and efavirenz (EFV). In all three subjects, conventional 
typing methods confirmed that the plasma virus was sensitive to the potent antiretroviral 
regimen that they received. Subjects 1727 and 1679 were well-suppressed patients. Subject 
1774 continued to have measureable amounts of HIV-1 RNA in plasma after 3, but not 6 
months of treatment. We obtained peripheral blood, inguinal lymph node, and terminal 
ileum and rectum biopsies once again at 3 and 6 months after starting treatment. Laboratory 
procedures for tissue management, in situ hybridization, and analytical pharmacology are 
described elsewhere13.

 Extraction and quantification of viral nucleic acids
Nucleic acids were extracted from frozen cells obtained from blood or lymphoid tissue using 
the MasterPure Complete DNA and RNA Purification Kit (Epicentre, Madison, WI). Viral 
RNA was isolated from plasma using the PureLink Viral RNA/DNA Mini Kit (Life 
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). HIV-1 was quantified using a quantitative reverse transcription 
PCR assay. The relative amount of HIV-1 target DNA was normalized to the quantification 
cycle for a concentration calibrator by using an external standard curve of serial 10-fold 
dilutions of reference DNA for the Gag region of HIV-1 derived from the plasmid pNL-43. 
All reactions were performed in triplicate on the ABI 7900HT sequence detector (Applied 
Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
Library preparation for deep sequencing
As the number of viral templates in the sampled material is low, we used an amplicon-based 
deep sequencing strategy. To minimize biased amplification of the target sequence, primer 
locations in the Gag and Pol regions of HIV-1 were selected on the basis of the alignment 
positional entropy in the multiple sequences aligned from the Los Alamos National 
Laboratory HIV-1 sequence database (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/). The primers were 
computationally screened for cross-dimer interactions and the concentration of each primer 
was optimized for amplification. For each sample, blanks were included to screen for 
contamination. We used designated, physically separated areas within the laboratory to set-
up PCR, which avoids contact with potentially contaminating amplicons.
To generate the long read-length PCR amplicons sequenced in this study (range, 509bp to 
587bp read-lengths per run depending on the gene region being analyzed), we amplified the 
Gag and Pol regions of HIV-1. For the Gag region of HIV-1, we used forward primer 
gag_632F_EK (5′-GCAGTGGCGCCCGAAC-3′ (corresponding to HXB2 nucleic acid 
sequence numbering positions 632 → 647) and reverse primer gag_1788R_EK (5’-
AATAGTCTTACAATCTGGGTTCGC -3′ (1788 → 1765). For the Pol region of HIV-1 that 
spanned the genomic region encoding the viral enzyme protease and reverse transcriptase, 
we used forward primer HIV-Pro1_2137F(5’-CAGAGCAGACCAGAGCCAAC-3′, 
corresponding to positions 2137 → 2156) and reverse primer HIV-RT1_3531R (5’-
CTGCTATTAAGTCTTTTGATGGGTC-3′ (3531 → 3507). PCR amplification was 
performed using the High Fidelity Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, 
CA) with thermal cycling conditions of 94°C for 2 mins, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 
15s, 54°C for 15s, 68°C for 1 mins, with a final extension step at 68°C for 5 mins.
We used an integrated sequencing pipeline for library construction, template amplification, 
and DNA sequencing as in20. Multiplex Identifiers were included during library preparation 
for sample barcoding. For the Gag region of HIV-1, we used the forward primer A-
Gag_977F_degEK 5′-primer A-GCTACAACCAKCCCTYCAGACAG-3′ (977 → 1000) and 
the reverse primer B-Gag_1564R_degEK 5′-primer B-
CTACTGGGATAGGTGGATTAYKTG-3′ (1564 → 1541) to generate a 587bp amplicon 
(977 → 1564). For the Pol region of HIV-1 that spanned the genomic region encoding the 
viral enzyme protease, we used forward primer A-Pol1_2235F 5′-primer A-
ACTGTATCCTTTAGCTTCCCTCA-3′ (2235 → 2262) and the reverse primer B-

 Pol1_2744R 5′-primer B-TTTCTTTATGGCAAATACTGGAG-3′ (2744 → 2721) to 
generate a 509bp amplicon (2235 → 2744). For the Pol region of HIV-1 that spanned the 
genomic region encoding the viral enzyme reverse transcriptase, we used forward primer A-
Pol2_2700F 5′-primer A- GGGCCTGAAAATCCATACAAT-3′ (2700 → 2721) and the 
reverse primer B-Pol2_3265R 5′-primer B-CATTTATCAGGATGGAGTTCATA-3′ (3265 →

conditions of 94°C for 2 mins, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 15s, 54°C for 15s, 68°C 
for 1 mins, with a final extension step at 68°C for 5 mins. DNA amplicon libraries were 
resolved on a pre-cast 2% agarose gel and purified with QIAquick Gel Extraction kit 
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and AMPure XP SPRI beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, 
IN).
Libraries were quantified with KAPA Library Quant Kit (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, 
MA) on Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA chip (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) 
for concentration and size distribution. The concentration of the product DNA was 
normalized before pooling to achieve sequence uniformity across amplicons. Controls were 
spiked into the reaction to monitor the library construction process and potential index cross-
contamination. The known internal control sequence (clonal sequence of 456 bp) introduced 
into the reaction was used to calculate the single nucleotide error rate and set the cut-off for 
the sequence analysis where no control errors could be detected. PCR errors are more 
common in later cycles of amplification, and being limited to small copy numbers they have 
little impact on the haplotype distribution. Bidirectional sequencing using the 454 Life 
Sciences’ GS-FLX sequencing platform (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) provided independent 
confirmation of sequence information. The long read-length sequences were sorted based on 
index sequences, trimmed to remove residual adapter bases from the ends of the reads, and 
filtered for length and duplicates prior to alignment. Read depth and coverage estimation 
that met predetermined coverage thresholds were performed as in20. Sequencing quality 
metrics were calculated for all samples using FastQC and only high-quality sequencing 
libraries were used in the ensuing analyses.
Sequence clean up and assembly
Experimental precision along with deep coverage allows for accurate estimation of the 
underpinning diversity of the virus population. We binned the sequence reads by multiplex 
identifier barcodes, and identified and excluded sequencing errors and misaligned regions 
from the analysis by computational methods. A small number of reads had a 
disproportionate number of errors that accounted for most of the inaccuracy in the full 
dataset. After quality filtering and trimming to a uniform length, we proceeded to build the 
different haplotypes present in each of the samples. We began by collapsing the identical 
sequences into haplotypes using reference-guided assembly to avoid the use of 
uninformative sequence repeats. Haplotypes at prevalence above the error threshold (defined 
by the internal control spiked in the sequencing runs), which corresponded to variants 
present above 0.04% of the total existing variants in the collapsed alignments, were used in 
the analysis.

 For the processing of the temporally and spatially linked deep-sequencing data for studying 
viral diversity, the viral sequences were first aligned against the HXB2 reference sequence 
(GenBank accession number K03455) using Segminator II (version 0.1.1). We then 
generated a consensus viral sequence for each patient as a reference for assembly to improve 
the alignment quality. A statistical model that utilizes platform error rates in conjunction 
with patterns within nucleotide frequencies derived from data obtained from related samples, 
that is, different compartments within the host or temporally linked samples, was used to 
separate low frequency platform error from true variation. This model is termed 
“probabilistic read error detection across temporally obtained reads” (PREDATOR) and is 
implemented within Segminator II. This statistical framework maintains the reading frame 
and corrects for deep sequencing errors19. We corroborated the number of haplotypes and 
the frequency of haplotypes that explain the data using a second reconstruction algorithm 
based on combinations of multinomial distributions to analyze the k-mer frequency 
spectrum of the sequencing data implemented with QuRe40. We screened the sequence 
alignments for recombinant sequences using the GARD algorithm implemented in 
HyPhy41,42.
Sampling variance
The high coverage of massively parallel sequencing is necessary to ensure reliable detection 
of low-frequency viral variants. A simple calculation based on the geometric distribution 
shows that in order to guarantee that a viral template occurring at frequency f is detected 
with probability p or better, it is necessary to sequence at least log (1-p) / log (1-f) – 1 
templates. A variant of frequency 0.01 (that is, 1%), for example, would require 450 
sequences to ensure its detection at probability 0.99 (that is, 99%) or better. Conversely, a 
study using 100 single-genome sequences would detect a variant of frequency 0.01 with 
probability 0.64. A low number of input DNA templates derived from one compartment that 
catches the spillover from another does not account for the complexities of partial 
observation and spatial heterogeneity that could lead to measurement error elsewhere16. This 
complication emphasizes the challenge in trying to extrapolate from single template 
sequencing the magnitude and character of the virus population that comprises the viral 
reservoir.
Maximum-likelihood tree construction
Maximum-likelihood phylogenies were created with PhyML using the general time-
reversible model with the proportion of invariant sites and gamma distribution of among-site 
rate variation (GTR+I+Γ4) nucleotide substitution model43 applying an approximate 
likelihood ratio test for branch support44. We estimated trees on viral sequence sets from 
which gaps in the alignment were removed and considered as missing data for the reason 
that maximum-likelihood tree error may increase with inclusion of unreliable sites. We 
assessed the temporal structure of the trees by performing linear regression on the root-to-tip 
distances of samples versus the time of sampling and tested the validity of the time-
dependency of the evolution rate estimates with the assumption of a strict molecular clock 
using the program Path-O-Gen v1.4 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/pathogen/). We used 
the Highlighter sequence visualization tool (www.HIV.lanl.gov) to trace commonality 
between sequences in an alignment based on individual nucleotide changes.

 Compartmentalization
We tested for subdivision of viral sequences into sub-populations in the different 
compartments at each time point. We calculated genetic distances using the Wright's FST and 
Snn test statistics45,46. We used a bootstrap test to determine the confidence of the estimates 
and performed a permutation test (1000 iterations) to assess the significance levels of the 
obtained scores.
Identifying selection
We used a modification of a random effects branch-site model to detect positive selection 
and test whether the phylogeny diverged over time47. A likelihood ratio hypothesis test 
compared the fit of the model using a 3-bin ω distribution (ω1 and ω2 in [0,1], ω3 
unrestricted) to describe the evolution of all branches in the tree, to the fit of the model 
where all ω3 is restricted to be in [0,1]. We tested whether or not a proportion of sites along 
internal branches of the intra-host viral phylogeny have been subject to episodic selection (ω 
> 1)24, restricting the test to internal branches to lessen the biasing effects of neutral or 
deleterious mutations on ω estimates48,49 and serve as a proxy for population level 
selection25,26.
Time-calibrated phylogenetic tree construction
To resolve the phyloanatomy, we reconstructed the temporal and spatial dynamics of the 
viral haplotype lineages with a Bayesian statistical framework using Markov chain Monte 
Carlo (MCMC) sampling for evolutionary hypothesis testing, as implemented in BEAST 
version 2.1.227. This approach was used to sample phylogenies from their joint posterior 
distribution, in which the viral haplotypes are restricted by their known date of sampling, 
using a simple substitution model described by Hasegawa–Kishino–Yano (HKY) to avoid 
over-parameterization50. Models differing in assumptions on mutation rate and effective 
population size were run for 100 million generations each and compared using the Bayes 
factor as implemented in Tracer version 1.6. We determined that the best-fit model included 
a strict molecular clock and assumed a constant population size. We used a symmetric 
transition model with constant rates over time that considered a discretized diffusion process 
among the different compartments. This was formalized as a continuous time Markov chain 
model to reconstruct the spatial dynamics between compartments. All chains were run for 
sufficient length and convergence of the relevant parameters was assessed using Tracer 
version 1.6, ignoring 10% of the chain as burn-in.
We summarized the connections between virus evolution and anatomical compartment 
history using an annotated MCC phylogenetic tree estimated with BEAST. The model and 
its parameters were chosen after computing the posterior probability of several models to 
obtain the discriminatory Bayes factors. Because population structure, whether due to spatial 
segregation or limitations to gene flow, may affect evolutionary dynamics, we confirmed that 
the direction of flow was not due to oversampling of a particular environment, by running a 
two-deme Bayesian inference under a structured coalescent model with a HKY substitution 
model assuming a strict molecular clock29, which is less susceptible to sampling issues than 
our trait-based analysis. For completeness, we conducted a search for topologies and 
divergence times assuming a relaxed molecular clock as well. In the analyses performed,

 HIV-1 showed a high degree of clock-like evolution and a mean nucleotide substitution rate 
expected to be within the bounds necessary to obtain meaningful phyloanatomic information 
from sequence data. Using the location of each of the haplotypes, a discrete trait was 
included in the inference. We used BEAST to estimate the probabilities of each of the 
possible states.

outcompetes the drug-sensitive strain and can continuously replicate. We argue that, 
typically, fully drug resistant mutants of this sort neither exist in the viral population of 
patients before treatment, nor arise through random mutation during the course of 
antiretroviral therapy (see Supplementary Information and Supplementary Table 2). Drug-
resistant strains, which are capable of ongoing replication at high effective drug 
concentrations are not typically generated in individuals because: they are generated in a 
single step very rarely; and stepwise generation from partially resistant strains is also rare 
because partially resistant strains are outcompeted in the sanctuary site which constantly 
refills the pool. The strain specific effective reproductive numbers for the drug-sensitive RS 
(orange) and drug-resistant RR (blue) strains are shown. For simplicity, only the impact of 
changes to the effectiveness of a single drug in a single compartment is shown.

We used sequence data from the Gag or Pol regions (protease [pol1] and retrotranscriptase 
[pol2]) regions of HIV-1 (range, 315bp to 487bp) to perform a genetic distance analysis. We 
masked the guanosines in APOBEC3 trinucleotide contexts of the edited sites from the 
alignments. We compared the proportion of substitutions per site (p-distance) for haplotypes 
within lymph node or blood from each subject at 6 months to the most common haplotype 
present at day 0. Most comparisons were statistically significant (Mann-Whitney U test, P-
values < 0.1), indicating ongoing diversification of the viral populations.

HIV-1 evolutionary rate calculated after removing 
hypermutated haplotypes
We used a linear regression model to estimate the evolutionary rate for the Gag or Pol 
regions (protease [pol1] and retrotranscriptase [pol2]) of HIV-1. We calculated the slope (μ) 
of the linear regression between time and the direct pairwise genetic distances (number of 
substitutions per site per month) from the most common haplotype at day 0 for each subject. 
Haplotypes found to harbor G-to-A hypermutant sequences were removed from the analysis 
to limit the effect of inactivating mutations on the estimates. There is very strong evidence, 
now presented in numerous studies17, that acute HIV-1 infections are by and large founded 
by a single (or at best a few) viral strains; this initial bottleneck is followed by rapid 
population diversification in the absence of treatment. The structures of our intra-host 
phylogenies at day 0 support this pattern. Even if multiple populations are transmitted and 
are able to establish infection and co-circulate, Bayesian phylodynamics models can 
properly account for it, and estimate evolutionary rates accurately.

 Figure 1. Time-structured phyloanatomic history of haplotypes in lymph nodes and blood
MCC phylogenetic trees constructed from the complete alignments of the haplotypes from 
the Gag region of HIV-1 for subjects 1774, 1727 and 1679 with all haplotypes (a, b and c, 
respectively) and with the haplotypes containing G-to-A hypermutations removed (d, e and 
f, respectively). Branch colors represent the most probable (modal) anatomic location of 
their descendent node inferred through Bayesian reconstruction of the ancestral state, along 
with the posterior probabilities for the location of their parental nodes.

 Figure 2. Cartoon illustration of the drug concentration-dependent spatial model
In the main compartment (i=0; the majority of lymphoid tissue and the blood) drug 
concentration is high (grey and red). In the sanctuary site (i=1; a small fraction of the 
lymphoid tissue and localized extracellular fluid) drug concentration is low (pink). There are 
uninfected cells (Xi), long-lived infected cells (Yi), and short-lived infected cells (Qi), as 
well as virus particles (Vi) that can be bound by few (Fi) or many (Gi) receptors on the 
follicular dendritic cell network. The dashed lines represent the effect of treatment in 
blocking infection and production of infectious virus particles. For graphical simplicity, we 
do not show the emergence of drug resistance, the production of noninfectious virus 
particles, virus clearance, nor cell death.

 Figure 3. Drug-dependent fitness landscape
Effective reproductive numbers for drug-sensitive (RS, orange line) and partially drug-
resistant (RR, blue line) strains are driven by the effective drug concentration of a single drug 
in the relevant compartment. Grey lines mark thresholds separating three possible outcomes. 
When effective drug concentrations are low, the benefit of drug resistance does not 
overcome the fitness cost of mutations and drug-sensitive strains dominate. This ceases to be 
true at intermediate effective drug concentrations and drug-resistant strains dominate. At 
high concentrations, both RS and RR fall below one (red line), neither strain can grow and 
virus replication is halted.

 Figure 4. Modelling replication dynamics and treatment effectiveness in the viral reservoir
In the main compartment, antiretroviral therapy is wholly effective against drug-sensitive 
virus (z0 = z̃0 = 1). In the sanctuary site, a, low treatment effectiveness (z1 = z̃1 = 0.3) favors 
drug-sensitive strains. Partially drug-resistant strains will exist, but at levels below those 
favoring stepwise evolution towards a fully drug-resistant strain. b, Intermediate treatment 
effectiveness (z1 = z̃1 = 0.6), favors partially drug-resistant virus at levels that may suffice 
for evolution towards a fully drug-resistant strain. c, high treatment effectiveness (z1 = z̃1 = 
1) favors the decline of all strains and the cessation of virus replication.
