Trends in Premarital Sex in the 
United States, 1954­–2003
SYNOPSIS
Objectives. Policy and programmatic efforts promoting sexual abstinence until 
marriage have increased, but it is unclear whether establishing such behavior 
as normative is a realistic public health goal. This study examined the propor-
tion of individuals in various cohorts who had had premarital sex (defined as 
either having had vaginal intercourse before first marrying or ever having had 
intercourse and never having married) by various ages.
Methods. Data from four cycles of the National Survey of Family Growth, 
1982–2002, and event history analysis techniques, including Kaplan-Meier life-
table procedures and Cox proportional-hazards regression models, were used 
to examine the incidence of premarital sex by gender and historical cohort. 
Results. Data from the 2002 survey indicate that by age 20, 77% of respon-
dents had had sex, 75% had had premarital sex, and 12% had married; by age 
44, 95% of respondents (94% of women, 96% of men, and 97% of those who 
had ever had sex) had had premarital sex. Even among those who abstained 
until at least age 20, 81% had had premarital sex by age 44. Among cohorts 
of women turning 15 between 1964 and 1993, at least 91% had had premarital 
sex by age 30. Among those turning 15 between 1954 and 1963, 82% had had 
premarital sex by age 30, and 88% had done so by age 44.
Conclusions. Almost all Americans have sex before marrying. These findings 
argue for education and interventions that provide the skills and information 
people need to protect themselves from unintended pregnancy and sexually 
transmitted diseases once they become sexually active, regardless of marital 
status.

Over the past decade, increasing amounts of advocacy, 
funding, and programmatic effort have focused on 
encouraging Americans to abstain from sexual inter-
course until they marry. The Personal Responsibility 
and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (i.e., wel-
fare reform) enacted in 1996 contained a provision 
authorizing $50 million annually in federal funding 
for abstinence-until-marriage education; programs 
funded under the act must teach that “abstinence 
from sexual activity outside marriage [is] the expected 
standard” of behavior and that “sexual activity outside 
of the context of marriage is likely to have harmful 
psychological and physical effects.”1 State programs 
funded under this authorization must have as their 
“exclusive purpose” the promotion of abstinence out-
side of marriage for people of any age.2 The current 
administration recently requested $204 million for 
fiscal year 2007 to fund abstinence-only education, 
and now requires such programs to emphasize “that 
the best life outcomes are more likely obtained if an 
individual abstains until marriage” and prohibits them 
from “promoting or encouraging the use of any type 
of contraceptives outside of marriage.”3 Due in part 
to government support, private advocacy efforts to 
promote abstinence until marriage are also gaining 
prominence and political clout.4
The primary stated goal of these efforts is to encour-
age all Americans to abstain from sex until they marry.5 
It follows that such programs consider it an achievable 
goal to make abstinence until marriage a normative 
behavior.6 However, the median age at first marriage 
increased from 22.1 to 25.8 for women and from 
24.4 to 27.4 for men over the past 25 years,7 and the 
proportion of the population 18 and older that had 
never married increased from 16% to 25% between 
1970 and 2004,8,9 suggesting that many individuals 
have a long interval after puberty and before marrying 
during which they may become sexually active. The 
median age at menarche is 12.6 and at spermarche is 
14.0,10 so this interval is now typically about 13 years 
for both men and women. That 70% of adolescent 
females and 65% of adolescent males have had sex 
by age 1911 and few have married suggests that a large 
percentage do so before marrying. The first goal of 
this analysis was to quantify current normative behavior 
by calculating the proportion of Americans who have 
had premarital sex.
In addition, public opinion polls over the last 20 
years have consistently shown that about 35% of adults 
say premarital sex is always or almost always wrong. 
(Unpublished tabulations of data from the General 
Social Survey, 1982–2004.) In the same vein, there is a 
common popular perception that most or all of those 
who came of age before the “sexual revolution” of the 
1960s and 1970s waited until they married to have sex, 
and that it is necessary to revert to the behaviors of 
that earlier time in order to eliminate the problems 
of unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted 
diseases. However, research has questioned whether 
such a chaste period ever existed.12 The second goal 
of the analysis was to assess whether the percentage 
of Americans having premarital sex has changed over 
time. 
Many or most abstinence-until-marriage program-
matic efforts are aimed at teens.13 The U.S. Department 
of Health and Human Services’ (DHHS’s) Healthy 
People 2010 goals include the objective of increasing 
the proportion of adolescents who abstain from sexual 
intercourse or use condoms if sexually active,14 and 
DHHS’s parenting skills web site states that “abstain-
ing from sex until . . . a mutually faithful marriage to 
an uninfected partner is the healthiest choice.”15 The 
third goal of this analysis was to assess whether those 
who abstain from sex at least until the end of their teen 
years are likely to abstain all the way until marriage.
MeThodS
The primary data sources for this analysis were the 
four most recent cycles of the National Survey of Fam-
ily Growth (NSFG), conducted in 1982, 1988, 1995, 
and 2002. The NSFG is a nationally representative, 
in-person survey that collects detailed information on 
individuals’ sexual, marital, contraceptive, and child-
bearing behaviors. The 1982, 1988, and 1995 NSFGs 
all surveyed women aged 15–44; the sample sizes were 
7,969 in 1982, 8,450 in 1988, and 10,847 in 1995. The 
2002 survey interviewed 7,643 women in this age range, 
and for the first time a sample of 4,928 men were also 
surveyed.16
I constructed a measure of premarital sex by combin-
ing measures of the age (in years and months) at which 
the respondent first had vaginal sexual intercourse (if 
the individual had ever had sex) and the age he or she 
first married (if the individual had ever married). A 
previously published cross-sectional analysis indicated 
that in the 2002 NSFG, 85% of ever-married women had 
had sex before they married,17 but this measure fails to 
take into account women who had never married but 
had already had sex. A better methodological approach 
(used in the current study) is event history analysis, 
which allows one to take into account the experience 
of people at all ages and of all marital statuses.18 
In the current analysis, an event was defined as 
having sex for the first time before ever having mar-
ried. Individuals whose month of first sex was earlier

than their month of first marriage, or who had had 
sex but had not married by the time of interview, were 
considered to have experienced the event. Those who 
had had sex for the first time in the same month as 
(or after) their first marriage and those who had nei-
ther had sex nor married contributed their months 
of nonexperience of the event to the analysis and 
were “censored” at the time of marriage (for those 
who had married) or at the time of interview (for 
those who had not married), since they ceased to be 
at risk of the event at that point. I then calculated the 
proportion of individuals who had had premarital sex 
by each age, or event curves, using Kaplan-Meier life-
table procedures.19 For comparison, I also calculated 
proportions for the occurrence of sex (premarital or 
otherwise) and marriage. 
Event curves were first calculated for all male and 
female respondents (together and separately) in the 
2002 NSFG. To better examine change over time, I 
used all four rounds of the NSFG to calculate separate 
curves for women only by 10-year age cohort, based on 
the year each person turned 15 and beginning with 
the 1954–63 cohort. Earlier cohorts have curves that 
extend to older ages than later cohorts, since only 
individuals in the earlier cohorts have reached those 
later ages. Finally, in order to examine the behavior 
of those who abstained until at least a certain age, I 
calculated premarital sex proportions for the subsets 
of men and women in the 2002 NSFG who had not 
yet had sex by exact ages 15, 18, and 20.
ReSUlTS
Figure 1 shows the proportion of individuals in the 
2002 survey who had had sex, had premarital sex, and 
married by each age; the Table contains the propor-
tion who had had premarital sex by specific ages for 
all respondents and by gender, as well as the median 
age at first premarital sex for various subgroups. By 
the exact age of 20 years, 77% of individuals had had 
sex, and 75% had had sex before marriage; 12% had 
married. By exact age 44, 99% of Americans had had 
sex, 95% had had sex before marriage, and 85% had 
married. At that age, 3.3% had abstained until mar-
riage, and 1.3% had neither married nor had sex. 
Thus, 97% of those who had ever had sex had done

so premaritally at some point. Cox tests of equality20 
indicated that the likelihood of having sex at all did 
not differ significantly by gender. However, males 
were slightly more likely to have had premarital sex at 
virtually every age; by exact age 44, 96% of males and 
94% of females had had premarital sex. Females were 
more likely to have married by each age, reflecting the 
fact that women typically marry at a younger age than 
men. It is important to note that although the overall 
marriage curve is included for comparison to the sex 
curves, the percent who had had premarital sex by a 
certain age cannot be calculated by taking the differ-
ence between the sex curve and the marriage curve at 
that age, because most of those who had both had sex 
and been married by that age had had sex first.
Figure 2 and the Table show premarital sex propor-
tions using data from all four surveys (for women only) 
by 10-year cohort. The figure and table show a trend 
from the 1950s through the 1990s toward a higher 
proportion experiencing premarital sex: 48% of the 
cohort who turned 15 from 1954 to 1963 had done so 
by exact age 20, while 65% of the 1964–73 cohort, 72% 
of the 1974–83 cohort, and 76% of the 1984–93 cohort 
had done so. For the 1994–2003 cohort, 74% had had 
premarital sex by exact age 20, a figure between that 
of the 1974–83 and 1984–93 cohorts. The difference 
between the first cohort and subsequent ones was larger 
than later differences.
Among those born in the 1940s and turning 15 from 
1954 to 1963, 82% had had premarital sex by exact 
age 30, and 88% had done so by exact age 44; for 
more recent cohorts turning 15 from 1964 to 1993, at 
least 91% had done so by exact age 30. The youngest 
cohort had not yet reached age 30 by the time of the 
most recent survey. A Cox proportional-hazards regres-
sion model20 including cohort as the only predictor 
indicated that the first four cohorts were significantly 
different from each other, but that the 1984–93 and the 
1994–2003 cohorts were not significantly different (not 
shown). Figure 2 suggests that the vast majority of those 
who have premarital sex have done so by age 30.
Figure 3 and the Table show premarital sex propor-
tions for those individuals (both male and female) 
in the 2002 NSFG who had not yet had sex by exact 
ages 15, 18, and 20. Ninety-four percent of those who 
abstained until at least age 15 and 89% of those who 
abstained until at least age 18 had had premarital sex 
by age 44. Even among the 28% of the population who 
had not had sex by age 20, 81% had had premarital 
sex by age 44.
diScUSSion
The results of the analysis indicate that premarital sex 
is highly normative behavior. Almost all individuals of 
both sexes have intercourse before marrying, and the 
proportion has been roughly similar for the past 40 
years. The slight decrease between the 1984–93 and 
1994–2003 cohorts was not statistically significant.

may be partly due to increased availability of effective 
contraception (in particular, the pill), which made it 
less likely that sex would lead to pregnancy;21 but even 
among women who were born in the 1940s, nearly nine 
in ten had had premarital sex by age 44. Among those 
who did not have sex at all during their teen years, 
eight in ten eventually had premarital sex.
Premarital sex as normative behavior is not surpris-
ing in an era when men and women typically marry 
in their mid-to-late twenties. Indeed, not only is pre-
marital sex nearly universal by age 30, but it is also 
very common at much younger ages. Evidence from 
the past 50 years suggests that establishing abstinence 
until marriage as normative behavior is a challenging 
policy goal. Instead, these findings argue for education 
and interventions that provide young people with the 
skills and information they need to protect themselves 
from unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted 
diseases once they become sexually active.
