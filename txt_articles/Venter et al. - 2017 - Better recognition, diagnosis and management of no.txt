Abstract 
 Cow’s milk allergy (CMA) is one of the most common presentations of food allergy seen in early childhood. It is also 
one of the most complex food allergies, being implicated in IgE‑mediated food allergy as well as diverse manifesta‑
tions of non‑IgE‑mediated food allergy. For example, gastrointestinal CMA may present as food protein induced 
enteropathy, enterocolitis or proctocolitis. Concerns regarding the early and timely diagnosis of CMA have been high‑
lighted over the years. In response to these, guideline papers from the United Kingdom (UK), Australia, Europe, the 
Americas and the World Allergy Organisation have been published. The UK guideline, ‘Diagnosis and management 
of non‑IgE‑mediated cow’s milk allergy in infancy—a UK primary care practical guide’ was published in this journal in 
2013. This Milk Allergy in Primary Care (MAP) guideline outlines in simple algorithmic form, both the varying presenta‑
tions of cow’s milk allergy and also focuses on the practical management of the most common presentation, namely 
mild‑to‑moderate non‑IgE‑mediated allergy. Based on the international uptake of the MAP guideline, it became 
clear that there was a need for practical guidance beyond the UK. Consequently, this paper presents an international 
interpretation of the MAP guideline to help practitioners in primary care settings around the world. It incorporates 
further published UK guidance, feedback from UK healthcare professionals and affected families and, importantly, also 
international guidance and expertise.

Background
Over the last 2 decades, many countries have seen a sig-
nificant rise in the number of children suffering from 
food allergy, defined as an adverse health effect arising 
from a specific immune response that occurs reproduc-
ibly on exposure to a given food [1]. The impact on qual-
ity of life for families with food allergy has been shown 
to be significantly worse than for those with chronic 
pain disorders [2] or diabetes [3]. For most infants with 
suspected cow’s milk allergy (CMA) this can be clinically 
subdivided into either immediate-onset IgE-mediated, 
where the adverse effects appear usually within minutes 
following ingestion or delayed onset non-IgE-mediated 
where the effects develop usually after ≥2 h [4]. It is dif-
ficult to define IgE-mediated food allergy into milder and 
more severe forms as external factors often determine 
the severity of reaction, with anaphylaxis being the most 
severe presentation [5]. The spectrum of non-IgE-medi-
ated CMA is broad; encompassing symptoms that range 
in severity from mild rectal bleeding in milk protein 
induced proctocolitis to the severe vomiting and collapse 
that can be seen in food protein induced enterocolitis 
syndrome (FPIES). Evidence from the United Kingdom

Venter et al. Clin Transl Allergy  (2017) 7:26 
(UK) [6] shows that the majority of infants presenting 
with suspected CMA fall into a ‘mild-to-moderate’ [7] 
clinical expression of non-IgE-mediated allergy. Although 
the severities of the non-IgE-mediated reactions were not 
clearly defined, data from the EuroPrevall study indicates 
the presence of milder forms of non-IgE-mediated food 
allergy in Europe, particularly in the Netherlands, Italy 
and Poland [8].
Whilst attempting to monitor this overall rise in sus-
pected food allergy in children, some controversy has 
arisen over the true incidence of this ‘mild-to-moderate’ 
non-IgE-mediated sub-group presenting characteris-
tically in infancy with mostly gastrointestinal-related 
symptoms such as abdominal discomfort, gastro-oesoph-
ageal reflux and abnormal bowel frequency and consist-
ency. In 2015 Schoemaker et al. [8] reported, as part of 
the EuroPrevall project that the national incidences of 
CMA in Europe vary across countries with the majority 
of children with CMA in the UK and the Netherlands 
suffering from the non-IgE-mediated form. However, 
the very low incidences reported in some countries have 
become the subject of debate. Nowak-Wegrzyn et al. [9] 
and Koletzko et al. [10] argued that the children with 
non-IgE-mediated CMA in 4 out of the 9 EuroPrevall 
countries were selectively missed due to clinical una-
wareness of gastro-intestinal symptoms and their rela-
tion to possible CMA. Non-IgE-mediated food allergy 
is also often reported in Latin America [11]. In line with 
the previously published MAP (Milk Allergy in Primary 
Care) guideline [7], the diagnosis of mild-to-moderate 
non-IgE-mediated CMA requires the strict avoidance of 
all cow’s milk containing foods for an agreed trial period, 
i.e. an elimination diet, followed by clinical improvement 
and then subsequent relapse coincident with reintroduc-
tion. This elimination-reintroduction sequence is the 
only way of reliably diagnosing gastrointestinal mani-
festations of non-IgE-mediated CMA in infants such as 
infantile allergic proctocolitis, mild-to-moderate allergic 
enteropathy and cow’s milk-induced gastro-oesophageal 
reflux or constipation because there is no allergy skin or 
blood test for non-IgE-mediated food allergy.
This paper, whilst acknowledging all the possible clini-
cal presentations of CMA in infancy (IgE and non-IgE 
with their differing diagnostic approaches), will focus 
primarily on the better recognition, confirmation and 
management of these infants presenting with suspected 
mild-to-moderate non-IgE-mediated CMA. The actual 
management of IgE-mediated CMA and the more severe 
presentations of non-IgE-mediated CMA, such as FPIES, 
Eosinophilic Esophagitis and food protein induced enter-
opathy with faltering growth will not be addressed. This 
iMAP guideline builds on the strengths of the previ-
ous UK MAP guideline, designed with a UK primary 
care focus, which has been demonstrated to effectively 
improve the recognition and earlier diagnosis of mild-to-
moderate non-IgE-mediated CMA [12] but has now been 
reviewed with an international focus. The guideline does 
not represent the views of, nor is it endorsed by, any pro-
fessional organisation, nor was it supported by any com-
mercial entity at any point in the development process.
Considerations behind the publication of the 2013 
UK MAP guideline [7]
A UK birth cohort study published in 2008 showed that 
2–3% of 1–3 year olds suffer from confirmed CMA [13]. 
Worldwide this prevalence ranges between 1.9 and 4.9% 
[14], making it one of the most common food allergies in 
the first years of life. In 2010 a review of 1000 infants with 
CMA randomly chosen from a UK primary care database 
[6] showed that 86% were first diagnosed in primary care 
and that the majority remained there for their care. 42% 
of the infants were referred on, usually to the care of a 
general paediatrician. Only a few were seen at a special-
ist level multidisciplinary paediatric allergy service. The 
majority presented clinically with mild-to-moderate 
symptoms of suspected non-IgE-mediated CMA. Sig-
nificantly smaller numbers could have been categorised 
as either severe non-IgE-mediated CMA or immediate-
onset IgE-mediated CMA. The review highlighted evi-
dence of under-recognition, misdiagnosis, significant 
delay in diagnosis and sub-optimal management of the 
infants especially in choosing the most appropriate ini-
tial alternative formula suitable for the management of 
CMA, when breast milk is not available. Fewer than 1 
in 5 families had received support from a dietitian [6]. 
The problem of over and under diagnosis of CMA with 
its inherent undesirable nutritional management is not 
unique to the UK. Van den Hooge et al. [15] and Vieira 
et al. [11] report similar problems in the Netherlands 
and Latin America respectively. To address the need for 
better diagnosis of food allergy, six international guide-
line papers were published from the: United States (US) 
[1], World Allergy Organization (WAO) [14], European 
Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Clinical Immunology 
(EAACI) [16], UK, National Institute of Health and Care 
Excellence (NICE) [17], British Society for Allergy and 
Clinical Immunology (BSACI) [18] and European Society 
for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutri-
tion (ESPGHAN) [19].
The UK NICE 2011 clinical guideline on the ‘Diagno-
sis and assessment of food allergy in children and young 
people in primary care and community settings’
, Clinical 
Guideline 116 (CG116) [17], addressed within its given 
scope only the presentation and initial assessment of 
any suspected food allergy. As part of the initial assess-
ment, it particularly emphasised the need to clinically 
 Page 3 of 9
Venter et al. Clin Transl Allergy  (2017) 7:26 
differentiate between non-IgE-mediated and IgE-medi-
ated expressions of food allergy.
Subsequently, a subgroup of the clinicians on the NICE 
guideline development group published the MAP guide-
line in 2013 [7]. It addressed in a simple algorithm-based 
pathway the initial presentation of the differing clinical 
expressions of CMA in infancy (both non-IgE and IgE) 
and the on-going management in primary care of those 
children with confirmed mild-to-moderate non-IgE-
mediated CMA.
Considerations behind the publication of this 2017 
updated version of MAP
Evidence showing the effectiveness of the MAP guide-
line [7] in positively changing UK prescribing patterns 
has been published [12]. Since 2013, frequent citations 
and use of MAP across the world have indicated that 
it is of practical clinical relevance not only for the UK 
but also for healthcare professionals working in other 
national healthcare systems. The important early health-
care contacts where the possibility of CMA needs to be 
explored between parents and a ‘first contact’ clinician 
do not essentially change from one healthcare system to 
another.
Significantly, UK NICE has now produced two further 
publications; in 2015 a NICE Clinical Knowledge Sum-
mary (CKS) on the diagnosis and management in primary 
care of ‘cow’s milk protein allergy in children’ [20], and 
in 2016 the NICE Quality Standard for food allergy [21]. 
Since the publication of the MAP guideline in 2013, the 
BSACI also published their specialist guidelines on cow’s 
milk allergy [18]. Since then, to our knowledge no other 
CMA guidelines have been published internationally.
This growing number of guidelines with clinical rel-
evance to CMA gives rise to the very real potential for 
‘guideline overload’
. A recent UK paper surveyed over 
400 general practitioners (GPs) and 300 parents looking 
at the current ‘journey from diagnosis to management of 
milk allergy’ for parents and the doctors in primary care 
[22]. The authors suggested an ideal pathway for the bet-
ter identification and management of CMA by healthcare 
professionals should include improved education focus-
ing on the current guidelines and the development of 
simple tools from the guidelines, such as algorithms, to 
aid diagnosis and management. A required action high-
lighted by the parents was the development of a simple 
tool centred on their recording of possible symptoms that 
they could take to the appointment with their healthcare 
professional. Meeting such requests will be of practical 
clinical relevance for healthcare professionals and fami-
lies in all healthcare systems.
These NICE primary care guidelines are UK focused 
and were not intended to be accessed and interpreted by 
clinicians based outside of the UK. However, the guid-
ance was widely adopted outside of the UK, suggesting 
the need for an updated non-UK focused interpretation. 
The aim of this paper is therefore to both incorporate 
these recent UK publications and to adapt MAP into a 
more internationally suited version. Management of Milk 
Allergy in Primary Care (iMAP), to act as both a UK and 
international guideline with amended algorithms (Figs. 2, 
3), supported by other practical tools for both families 
and healthcare professionals in primary care (Additional 
files 1, 2, 3, 4).
Clinicians recognise the important role families and 
carers have in supporting children with food allergy and 
that ‘family members and carers should be involved in 
the decision-making process about investigations, treat-
ment and care’ [20]. This iMAP version aims to facilitate 
that important role.
Presentation and recognition of CMA
Revisiting CMA nomenclature
The UK NICE guidelines along with other national and 
international guidelines clearly indicate that CMA is 
broadly divided into IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated 
disease. Although they acknowledge that the non-IgE-
mediated presentation can be divided into mild-to-mod-
erate and more severe presentations, there is currently no 
international consensus with clearly agreed definitions of 
these presentations. Indeed even in terms of Eosinophilic 
Oesophagitis (EoE), experts and international bodies 
disagree about whether this is a disease that is primarily 
non-IgE-mediated [23] or in fact a mixed IgE and non-
IgE-mediated disease [1].
The allergy‑focused clinical history
The allergy-focused clinical history continues to form 
the ‘cornerstone of diagnosis’ in food allergy and ‘chil-
dren and young people with suspected food allergy 
should have an allergy-focused clinical history taken’ 
[21]. EAACI also recently published a task force report 
on how to take an allergy-focused diet history to aid with 
the diagnosis of a food allergy [24].
This process will support the clinician to distinguish 
between IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated reactions, 
based primarily on the information provided by the fam-
ily. This will then inform the healthcare professional with 
the appropriate competencies/clinical expertise to decide 
which other tests, if any, are needed to confirm the diag-
nosis and then how the food allergy should be managed.

 Figure 1 provides a list of questions to ask during the 
allergy-focused history, but in short such a history will 
focus on the following questions [7].
The symptoms of the infant at first presentation are a 
key feature in the diagnostic process. It is important to 
consider that possible symptoms (Fig. 2) can be variable 
and overlap with common infant health issues such as 
irritability (colic), gastro-oesophageal reflux and atopic 
dermatitis that may not necessarily be CMA-related. 
There is also often confusion between immediate-onset 
IgE-mediated allergy and delayed-onset non-IgE-medi-
ated allergy symptoms.
The iMAP Allergy focused Clinical History
for Suspected Cow’s Milk Allergy in Infancy
‘The Cornerstone of the Diagnosis’
Ask about:
• A family history of atopic disease (atopic derma��s, asthma, allergic rhini�s or food allergy)
in parents or siblings
– a reported history along with symptoms of suspected cow’s milk allergy makes
the diagnosis more likely; this applies to both IgE mediated and non IgE mediated
• Sources of cow’s milk protein and how much is being or was ingested:
Exclusive breast feeding
when cow’s milk protein from maternal diet comes through
in the breast milk (low risk of clinical allergy)
Mixed feeding
when cow’s milk protein is given to the breast feeding infant
e.g. top up formulas, on weaning with solids
Formula feeding infant
the commonest presenta�on, par�cularly in countries where
there is poor adherence with the WHO guidance (14) of exclusive breas�eeding for 6 months
• Presen�ng symptoms, to include:
if more than one symptom, the sequence of clinical presenta�on of each one
age of first onset
�ming of onset following inges�on (atopic derma��s such ‘�ming’ can be very variable)
IgE mediated
usually within minutes, but can be up to 2 hours
Non IgE mediated
usually a�er
2 hours or even days
dura�on, severity and frequency
reproducibility on repeated exposure
amount and form of milk protein that may be causing symptoms
• Details of any concern with feeding difficul�es and/or poor growth
• Details of any changes in diet and any apparent response to such changes
• Details of any other previous management, including medica�on, for the
presen�ng symptoms and any apparent response to this

An attempt should therefore be made to elicit a his-
tory of all symptoms, assess which are significantly out of 
the range of normal, and classify them as indicating sus-
pected IgE-mediated or non-IgE-mediated disease. The 
4 possible symptom complexes of: IgE-mediated disease 
(mild-to-moderate or severe) and non-IgE-mediated dis-
ease (mild-to-moderate or severe) serve as an entry point 
for an initial dietary management strategy (Fig. 2).
Recognising the importance of the first contact con-
sultation between the family and the healthcare profes-
sional, the iMAP guideline team are in the process of 
developing a symptom tool. There is currently just one 
published Cow’s milk related symptom score (CoMiSS) 
and this needs further validation [25]. Initial data how-
ever, indicates that a change in CoMiSS from baseline 
to month 1 after milk exclusion, can be used to predict 
CMA [26] (Fig. 2).
As part of the allergy-focused healthcare consulta-
tion, it is important to carry out a physical examination 
[20], particularly looking for signs indicating any allergy-
related comorbidities such as atopic dermatitis and, in 
addition, performing weight, length and head circumfer-
ence measurements.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of non‑IgE‑mediated CMA
If the clinical history suggests non-IgE-mediated CMA 
and the child ‘has not had a severe delayed reaction’
, it 
is recommended to offer a trial elimination of the sus-
pected allergen and subsequent reintroduction [21] 
(Fig. 3).
We have previously described indications for the differ-
ent formulas for the diagnosis and management of the 
varying expressions of CMA based on a consensus of 
national and international guidelines [7]. As the iMAP 
guideline focuses on the diagnosis and management of 
mild-to-moderate CMA, we wish to highlight here the 
following points:

Extensively hydrolysed formulas (eHFs) continue 
to be recommended as the initial prescribed for-
mulas for most infants presenting with suspected 
mild-to-moderate CMA. However, worldwide, there 
is at least one example of national practice where 
an amino acid-based formula (AAF) is commonly 
chosen as the initial diagnostic trial formula in all 
suspected cases of CMA, e.g. China. Therefore, the 
authors acknowledge that practice varies and in 
some countries an AAF is used as the initial diag-
nostic trial formula for CMA. It is however impor-
tant to note that such practice is based on local ser-
vices, reimbursements of formulas and not born out 
of clinical evidence based indications for AAF [27]. 
When an infant reacts to the amount of milk pro-
tein passed on from maternal consumption during 
breastfeeding, it is recommended to avoid cow’s milk 
from the maternal diet as the first priority. If a sup-
plemental formula is required, an eHF or AAF may 
be utilised [28]. This decision needs to be taken on 
an individualised basis, as this depends on whether 
full symptom resolution has occurred on a maternal 
elimination diet, the nutritional status of the infant 
and the underlying CMA diagnosis. 
In view of the international focus of the iMAP guide-
lines, we want to acknowledge that soy formula may 
be used as the first line alternative to cow’s milk for-
mula in some countries, e.g. South Africa. It is how-
ever not recommended under 6 months of age in the 
USA, Europe, UK, Brazil and Australia and not as 
the first line of treatment except for Australia where 
soy may be recommended as first line treatment in 
infants over 6 months of age in certain CMA condi-
tions [14, 29].

Therefore, local interpretation of the iMAP guide-
lines may be required in some clinical scenarios.
The reintroduction step, following clear improvement 
of symptoms during the elimination trial, is of ultimate 
importance to confirm the diagnosis. In the absence 
of such a planned reintroduction step to confirm the 
return of symptoms and their subsequent resolution on 
recommencing the elimination diet, the risk of a signifi-
cant number of infants continuing unnecessarily on an 
expensive and nutritionally demanding diet will remain. 
The optimum time to explain and agree on the need for 
the planned early reintroduction is when the trial elimi-
nation diet is first started. At that consultation it can 
be helpful to allow the family to take away with them 
a factsheet explaining why such a trial elimination diet 
is needed, followed by a planned reintroduction (Addi-
tional file 1).
The iMAP Management Algorithm for mild-to-moder-
ate non-IgE-mediated CMA (Fig. 3) provides guidance on 
the length and type of the initial elimination diet; for up 
to 4 weeks (with a minimum of 2 weeks) in conjunction 
with optimal dietary advice. It is important to emphasise 
that we are looking for a clear improvement and not nec-
essarily a complete resolution of symptoms [22].
There is an accompanying iMAP written protocol for 
both the parent and healthcare professional, setting out 
how cow’s milk protein can then be gradually, simply and 
safely reintroduced into either the mother’s or infant’s 
diet at home to confirm or exclude the diagnosis (Addi-

If the clinical history suggests IgE-mediated CMA, then 
‘further testing is recommended’ [21]. This can be done 
as ‘either a skin prick test or blood test for specific IgE 
antibodies to the suspected food allergens…
’ [21] (Fig. 2).
It is important to recognise that a positive skin prick 
test or a positive serum specific IgE blood test sim-
ply shows sensitisation (i.e. presence of IgE antibodies) 
to a food allergen, but, on its own, does not confirm an 
allergy. The final diagnosis of clinical allergy depends 
on the interpretation of the results in the context of the 
clinical history and made by a clinician with the appro-
priate training and skills [21]. The ability of primary care-
based clinicians to perform and interpret these tests will 
differ from country to country. In many cases these tests 
should ideally be performed in secondary care or allergy 
referral centers [20]. Additionally, in some cases the his-
tory and the allergy test results will not be sufficient to 
confirm the diagnosis. A supervised food challenge will 
then be required, and must only be performed under the 
care of medical providers with the relevant training and 
skills [17].
It should be emphasised that the iMAP early Home 
Reintroduction to confirm diagnosis and then the iMAP 
Home Milk Ladder to test for later acquired tolerance 
should only be used in children with mild-to-moderate 
non-IgE-mediated CMA and not in other presentations 
such as IgE-mediated CMA or severe non-IgE-mediated 
CMA (e.g. FPIES).
Whilst waiting for a specialist assessment, the iMAP 
Presentation Algorithm (Fig. 2) guides as to the necessary 
change to either the maternal diet or infant formula. It 
may also be helpful to direct parents to national patient 
support websites.
Management of mild‑to‑moderate confirmed 
non‑IgE‑mediated CMA within primary care or 
by the ‘first contact’ clinician (Fig. 3)
When the diagnosis of mild-to-moderate non-IgE-medi-
ated CMA is confirmed, iMAP provides guidance on the 
on-going management in primary care and recommends 
dietetic support. The management will include continu-
ation of treatment with a suitable alternative formula or, 
if indicated, maternal allergen avoidance. Most impor-
tantly, milk free weaning advice should be provided by 
the dietitian not only to ensure that cow’s milk is avoided 
in the infant’s complementary diet, but also to address 
growth [11], nutritional [30] and feeding problems in the 
short [31] and long term [32].
The on-going management includes a second planned 
reintroduction of milk protein when the time comes to test 
for acquired tolerance. The iMAP Management Algorithm 
guides on the timing of this as well. It is usually carried out 
in the form of a graduated ‘Milk Ladder’ (Additional file 3). 
Ideally at this stage a dietitian will be taking the lead.
In the development of this new iMAP Milk Ladder, a 
number of factors were taken into account such as the 
dose of cow’s milk protein provided, the timing and tem-
perature of heating, as well as the matrix effect of wheat 
and fat [5]. Healthy eating, general feeding practices 
across the world and other food allergies have also been 
taken into account. The dietitians involved in develop-
ing the Ladder have therefore reduced the number of 
Steps in the Ladder. Many of the high sugar foods have 
been removed as a necessary step, but are still offered as 
an option, once a certain Step has been passed, e.g. milk 
chocolate/candy can be given once Step 5 (yoghurt) is 
passed. Foods eaten by only certain cultural groups have 
been removed, such as Shepherd’s pie.
Suspected severe non‑IgE mediated CMA
In the uncommon situation of the infant presenting with 
more severe symptoms leading to a suspected severe 
expression of non-IgE-mediated CMA, the iMAP Pres-
entation Algorithm (Fig. 2) identifies these infants, 
 Page 8 of 9
Venter et al. Clin Transl Allergy  (2017) 7:26 
advises on the need for early onward referral to a special-
ist allergy service. For most of these infants the severity 
of the symptoms and their significant improvement on 
commencing the elimination diet will be enough to con-
firm the diagnosis. However, should they still need an 
early food challenge to confirm or exclude the diagnosis 
that will need to be done under the careful supervision of 
a specialist allergy team [21].
Referral
Any specialist allergy service for children should be led 
by a paediatrician or other appropriately trained physi-
cian, supported by a multidisciplinary team made up of 
specialist dietitians, nurses and ideally a clinical psychol-
ogist all with the necessary expertise in childhood food 
allergy. Due to the multisystem involvement of CMA, 
other medical specialities may also need to be readily 
accessible, including gastroenterology and dermatology.
Conclusion
CMA is one of the most common food allergies affect-
ing children worldwide and, with few exceptions, pre-
sents in the first months of life. Clinically it is complex 
due to its differing possible presentations making it chal-
lenging to diagnose. These factors have underscored the 
need for UK NICE guidance as well as the MAP primary 
care CMA guideline written by a group of the clinicians 
who were part of the NICE food allergy guideline devel-
opment group. Most infants who present with suspected 
CMA have non-IgE-mediated manifestations with mild-
to-moderate and delayed-onset symptoms. However, 
those infants who present with either immediate-onset 
IgE-mediated symptoms or those who progress to more 
severe non-IgE-mediated symptoms need to be promptly 
and reliably identified in order to allow early referral.
There is evidence that there are significant care issues for 
these young infants with any expression of CMA and also 
for their families. Evidence showing the effectiveness of the 
earlier MAP guideline in positively changing UK prescrib-
ing patterns has been published. This newer MAP guideline 
version, iMAP (based now on a wider range of relevant UK 
NICE publications and the input of international clinical 
experts) with its amended algorithms and growing portfolio 
of accompanying practical tools should help both primary 
care or ‘first contact’ clinicians work better with the fami-
lies to further improve the quality of care. Hopefully this will 
lead to better health outcomes including: the earlier identifi-
cation of CMA, early referral of children requiring specialist 
allergy review and identification of those remaining children 
who can be effectively and safely managed in primary care. 
This approach will be of practical clinical relevance not only 
for the UK but also for healthcare professionals working in 
other national healthcare systems.
