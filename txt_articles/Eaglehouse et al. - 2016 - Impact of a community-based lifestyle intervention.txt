Abstract
Background—The presence of risk factors for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, or the 
conditions themselves, contributes to lower health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among adults. 
Although community-based lifestyle intervention programs have been shown to be effective for 
improving risk factors for these diseases, the impact of these interventions on HRQoL has rarely 
been described.
Purpose—To examine changes in HRQoL following participation in the Group Lifestyle 
Balance program, a community translation of the Diabetes Prevention Program lifestyle 
intervention for adults with pre-diabetes and/or the metabolic syndrome.
Methods—Participants enrolled in the 12-month, 22-session intervention program (N=223) 
completed the EuroQol Health Questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L) at baseline, 6, and 12 months. Linear 
mixed effects regression models determined change in EQ-5D-Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and 
Index scores post-intervention.
Results—Mean EQ-5D-VAS improved by +7.38 (SE=1.03) at 6 months and by +6.73 (SE=1.06) 
at 12 months post-intervention (both; p<0.0001). Mean changes in EQ-5D Index values were 
+0.00 (SE=0.01; NS) and +0.01 (SE=0.01; p<0.05), respectively. Adjusted for age, baseline score, 
and achieving intervention goals, mean change in EQ-5D-VAS was +11.83 (SE=1.61) at 6 months 
and +11.23 (SE=1.54) at 12 months (both; p<0.0001). Adjusted mean change in EQ-5D Index 
value was +0.04 (SE=0.01) at 6 months and +0.05 (SE=0.01) at 12 months (both; p<0.01).
Conclusions—Participation in a community lifestyle intervention program resulted in improved 
HRQoL among adults with pre-diabetes and/or the metabolic syndrome. These benefits to

 HRQoL, together with improved clinical and behavioral outcomes, should increase the appeal of 
such programs for improving health.

Introduction
Adults with increased risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) report lower 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) than healthy adults [1–6]. As an example, individuals 
with elevated blood glucose report reduced HRQoL relative to individuals with normal 
glucose whether diabetes is present [2,3] or not [4,7]. Low physical activity (PA) levels and 
obesity, which contribute to risk for type 2 diabetes and CVD [8,9], have also been shown to 
be related to poorer HRQoL [10,7].Thus, improving PA levels, weight, and type 2 diabetes 
and CVD risk factors as part of a behavioral lifestyle intervention should result in an 
improved HRQoL among adults at risk for cardio-metabolic diseases.
By increasing participants’ PA levels and achieving successful weight loss [11], the Diabetes 
Prevention Program (DPP) lifestyle intervention was able to reduce the incidence of type 2 
diabetes and the metabolic syndrome among adults with impaired glucose tolerance [12,13]. 
In addition to decreasing the development of type 2 diabetes, the DPP lifestyle intervention 
resulted in improved HRQoL among participants in areas of general health, physical 
function, body pain, and vitality [14]. Participants in the lifestyle intervention continued to 
experience HRQoL benefits up to 3 years following enrollment [15].
The DPP lifestyle intervention has since been modified and translated in a variety of 
community settings, including health-care facilities, senior centers, churches, and 
workplaces. Although these community intervention programs have been shown to be 
successful for weight loss [16–18] and increasing PA levels [19–22], little is known as to 
whether participants in these programs also experience improvements in HRQoL. This 
investigation evaluated HRQoL among participants in the Healthy Lifestyle Project, a 
randomized trial of a behavioral lifestyle program adapted from the DPP lifestyle 
intervention for translation in the community setting. Specifically, it tested the secondary 
hypothesis that participants in the lifestyle intervention experience beneficial changes in 
HRQoL after 6 months compared to wait-control counterparts. Further analysis examined 
whether beneficial changes in HRQoL occurred after 12 months of intervention, 
complementary to observed changes in the primary outcome of weight and other secondary 
outcomes of physical activity and risk factors for type 2 diabetes and CVD that have been 
previously reported [23,24].
Methods
This investigation extends previous work of an NIH funded intervention trial, the Healthy 
Lifestyle Project (PI: Dr. A. Kriska), evaluating the effectiveness of a DPP-based lifestyle 
intervention translated for use in diverse community settings. The study intervention 
program, Group Lifestyle Balance ™ (GLB) [25,21], is a 12-month, 22-session adaptation

 of the DPP lifestyle intervention that was developed by members of the original DPP 
Lifestyle Resource Core who are now faculty of the University of Pittsburgh Diabetes 
Prevention Support Center (DPSC). The DPP-GLB curriculum is approved for application to 
the CDC National Diabetes Prevention Recognition Program [26,27], which establishes 
standards and operating procedures for lifestyle interventions to assure program quality. The 
study investigators partnered with a local worksite and three senior community centers to 
implement the DPP-GLB Program. The study protocol was approved by the University of 
Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board.
Study Design
The Healthy Lifestyle Project employed a randomized six-month delayed wait-control 
design. Participants were randomized to begin the DPP-GLB Program immediately 
(immediate) or after a 6 month delay (delayed) in a 2:1 ratio by intervention site. This design 
mimics the real-life circumstances faced by community-based programs where resources 
may limit the frequency and capacity of programming and participants may experience a 
delay before a program is available for them to enter. A randomization sequence using block 
lengths of six was generated with a SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) program by a 
single study researcher. Allocation assignments were placed in a sealed envelope by a 
second study researcher who was blinded to the randomization sequence and distributed the 
sealed envelopes to each participant at the end of their baseline assessment visit.
Study Population
Recruitment and screening were conducted at a large corporate worksite and three senior 
community centers in socio-economically diverse neighborhoods in the Pittsburgh 
metropolitan area between September 2010 and December 2011 [28,29]. Interested adults 
(age ≥18 years) completed a fasting fingerstick for glucose and lipids and anthropometric 
measurements to determine eligibility. Eligible adults had a BMI ≥ 24 kg/m2 (≥ 22 kg/m2 for 
Asians) and pre-diabetes (American Diabetes Association criteria; [30]) and/or the 
metabolic syndrome (National Cholesterol Education Program ATP-III criteria; [31]), or 
treatment for hyperlipidemia (i.e. taking a cholesterol-altering medication) and at least one 
additional component of the metabolic syndrome. Individuals with a previous diagnosis of 
type 1 or type 2 diabetes or with screening values in the diabetes range [30] were excluded 
and directed to their primary care physician for follow-up care. Women who were pregnant, 
planning to become pregnant, or breast feeding at the time of screening were not eligible. 
Eligible and interested individuals provided written informed consent before enrolling in the 
study.
Intervention
The 12-month, 22-session DPP-GLB program has been described previously [25,32] and 
materials and implementation support are available online 
(www.diabetesprevention.pitt.edu). In brief, the DPP-GLB program promotes goals of 
increasing PA to at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity per week and achieving a 7% 
weight loss. Individuals were given calorie goals (1,200–2,000 kcal/day) and fat gram goals

 (33–55 grams/day) based on starting weight to facilitate the loss of 1–2 pounds per week, 
but goals could be modified to support progress. Participants were encouraged to self-
monitor diet, PA, and weight information daily for which they received regular feedback and 
coaching throughout the 12 month program.
At time of randomization, participants were given the option of completing the first 12 
weekly DPP-GLB sessions in face-to-face groups or to participate via individually-viewed 
DVD with follow-up contact with a lifestyle coach. The remaining 10 bi-weekly and 
monthly sessions were delivered as face-to-face groups. All sessions/contacts were 
facilitated by a DPSC trained lifestyle coach employed by the study, two of which were 
registered dietitians and one was an exercise specialist. Each face-to-face session lasted 
approximately 60 minutes and each telephone contact was approximately 15 minutes long. 
General health information was mailed to delayed participants intermittently during the six 
month wait-control period. After the 6 month wait, delayed participants received the DPP-
GLB program in its entirety.
Assessment
All measures were collected by trained research staff following a standard protocol at 
randomization (baseline), and at 6 and 12 months from start of intervention. Assessors were 
not blinded to participant randomization assignments. Participants in the delayed arm 
attended one additional assessment visit at 6 months following randomization, repeating 
baseline measures, to capture changes in outcomes at the end of the 6 month wait-control 
period. For the purposes of this evaluation, pre-intervention assessment visit refers to 
randomization (baseline) and post-intervention assessment visits refer to the time since an 
individual’s start of the intervention (6 and 12 month), regardless of randomization 
assignment. Participants received a $25 gift card for each clinical assessment visit 
completed, but did not receive compensation for attending intervention sessions.
Health-Related Quality of Life
Participants completed the self-administered EuroQol (EQ-5D-3L) Health Questionnaire 
[33] to capture current health states at time of assessment. The instrument has been used in a 
variety of patient populations [34–36] and is comparable to other widely used HRQoL 
assessment instruments [36,34,37]. On the EQ-5D-3L, participants indicated whether they 
had “no”, “some”, or “extreme” problems in five different health dimensions: mobility, self-
care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The descriptive measure was 
scored as one Index value, calculated using the Crosswalk Index Value Calculator for the 
United States available from EuroQol (www.euroqol.org). The index values are anchored at 
a health state of “no” problems in the 5 dimensions=1 and dead=0. The EQ-5D-3L has been 
previously evaluated by Dolan et al. for logical consistency (extent to which better health 
states receive a higher index score; 83–92%), construct validity, and test-retest reliability 
(Pearson’s r= 0.55–0.83) [38]. The mean U.S. EQ-5D Index value has been estimated from a 
national sample of approximately 53,600 non-institutionalized adults to be 0.87 [35]. 
Participants were also asked to rate their current health state on a visual analog scale 
(EQ-5D-VAS) of 0 “worst imaginable health state” to 100 “best imaginable health state”.

 The U.S. average for the EQ-5D-VAS is estimated to be 79.2 based on a national sample of 
13,600 non-institutionalized adults [10].
Perceived Health
In a sub-sample of community center participants, a second self-administered survey that 
was developed by the current study researchers asked participants to indicate if they felt their 
health state had worsened, remained the same, or improved during the prior 6 months. This 
question was used to determine if indicators of current health state on the EQ-5D reflected 
usual health during the intervention time frame.
Weight
Participants were weighed in light clothing and without shoes on a digital physician scale 
(DETECTO® PD100).
Physical Activity
Research staff administered the Modifiable Activity Questionnaire (MAQ) to capture 
detailed estimates of past-month leisure PA, calculated from frequency and duration of 40 
common recreational activities. Each activity was weighted in metabolic (MET)-equivalents 
using a compendium of physical activities [39], and leisure PA was expressed in MET-hours 
per week. The MAQ is a reliable and valid instrument for use in adult populations [40–45].
Statistical Analysis
Univariate linear regression models and Mantel-Haenszel Chi-square test for trend compared 
change in variables of interest during the 6 month wait-control period between the two 
intervention arms. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used as an indicator of the test-retest 
reliability of the EQ-5D-VAS (r=0.54) and Index (r=0.52) scores for the wait-control arm 
(n=71). Pre-post intervention changes in HRQoL were calculated as the difference in 
EQ-5D-VAS and Index values between the post-intervention assessment visit (6 and 12 
months) and study randomization (baseline) for each individual. Repeated measures 
analyses with participant defined clusters were conducted using mixed-effects linear 
regression models. Intention-to-treat analysis using all available participant data points from 
completed assessments (baseline, 6 and 12 months) was used to generate restricted 
maximum likelihood-based estimates for change in the outcome measures. Residuals were 
examined to verify that model assumptions were fulfilled. The intraclass correlation 
coefficient (ICC) for within-subject clusters ranged from 0.32–0.83 for the outcomes 
modeled. A within-subject covariance structure was selected with compound symmetry 
having the best fit to account for the within-subject clustering of data and provide robust 
estimates of standard errors for fixed effects [46].
In unadjusted and multivariate adjusted regression modeling, socio-demographic factors 
including age, sex, and educational attainment; program features including intervention site 
and delivery mode (face-to-face group or DVD), and indicators of meeting the programs 
goals for 7% weight loss and 150 minutes of PA were tested for effects on estimated change 
in EQ-5D-VAS and Index values. A binary indicator for calendar season at time of

 assessment visit (summer or winter) was included in the models to adjust for observed 
seasonal impact on both PA level and estimates of PA change during intervention in this 
sample (unpublished data). Covariates were selected for testing in adjusted models based on 
univariate effects (p<0.25) and goodness of fit evaluated by AIC and BIC criteria. 
Intervention site was included as a random effect in the unadjusted and adjusted models due 
to within-site clustering of the data for the outcomes reported (ICC=0.03–0.18). In a 
stratified analysis, separate unadjusted linear mixed models were used to estimate the mean 
change in EQ-5D-VAS score and Index score for individuals who reported a baseline value 
above/below the reported U.S. averages [10,35].
Distributions of perceived change in health over the previous 6 months were evaluated with 
Bowker’s Test of Symmetry under the null hypothesis of symmetric cell proportions in a 
3×3 contingency table. An alpha of 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. All 
analyses were performed in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).
Results
The Healthy Lifestyle Project enrolled a total of 223 participants from the worksite and three 
community centers. Successful changes in weight and PA levels have been documented 
across all intervention sites [24,47,23], allowing the combination of participants from the 
four intervention sites for these analyses. In total, 93.7% of participants were non-Hispanic 
Whites, 62.3% of participants were female, 65.9% reported working full- or part-time, and 
63.2% of participants reported obtaining at least a college degree. The mean baseline age 
was 58.4 [standard deviation (SD) 11.5] years and the mean baseline weight was 208.8 
(SD=41.8) pounds. The median baseline self-reported PA was 7.88 [Interquartile range 
(IQR) 2.19–16.69] MET-hours per week. Overall, participants reported a mean baseline 
EQ-5D-VAS value of 71.5 (SD=16.6), which is slightly lower than the estimated U.S. 
average of 79.2 [10]. The overall mean baseline EQ-5D index value was 0.91 (SD=0.09) at 
baseline, indicating a generally healthy sample based on the estimated U.S average of 0.87 
[35]. Furthermore, 39% of the sample reported “no” problems in the 5 questionnaire 
dimensions (EQ-5D index value of 1.00). Demographic and clinical characteristics of the 
immediate and delayed arms were similar at baseline.
6-Month Wait-Control Comparisons
The delayed wait-control design allowed for comparisons between the immediate and 
delayed arms at the end of the first 6 months, during which time the immediate participants 
received 6 months of lifestyle intervention and the delayed participants served as wait-
controls. After 6 months of intervention for the immediate participants, they achieved 
significantly greater improvements in weight, PA levels, EQ-5D-VAS, and EQ-5D Index 
scores than delayed participants (Table 1). The model-estimated least squares mean 
(standard error) intervention effects were −9.23 (1.37) lbs. for weight, +6.72 (2.44) MET-
hours/week for PA, +6.55 (2.10) points for EQ-5D-VAS, and +0.03 (0.01) points for EQ-5D 
Index score (all; p<0.05). Similarly, 61.3% of participants in the immediate arm compared to 
14.3% of participants in the delayed arm reported an improvement in usual health over the 
past 6 months on the self-reported perceived health survey (between group p<0.0001).

 Pre-Post Intervention Behavioral and Health-Related Quality of Life Changes
Immediate and delayed randomized arms were combined to evaluate pre-post intervention 
changes in weight, PA level, and HRQoL since the behavioral and clinical outcomes 
improved similarly in both randomized arms at 6 and 12 months from start of intervention 
relative to baseline (data not shown). Retention at post-intervention assessment visits was 
91.5% (n=204) at 6 months and 84.8% (n=189) at 12 months. Baseline HRQoL, PA level, 
and weight did not differ between those who did or did not attend follow-up assessments.
The DPP-GLB lifestyle intervention resulted in significant improvements in participant 
health behaviors at 6 and 12 months post-intervention. Participants achieved a significant 
reduction in mean weight of −11.9 (SD=11.3) pounds (−5.7%) and −11.1 (SD=13.9) pounds 
(−5.4%) at 6 and 12 months, respectively (both; p<0.0001). Overall, 35.5% of participants 
achieved the 7% weight loss goal at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Participants increased 
mean leisure PA by +7.01 [standard error (SE)=1.74] MET-hours/wk at 6 months and by 
+6.16 (SE=1.74) MET-hours/wk at 12 months (both; p<0.0001) after adjusting for season. 
Self-reported PA levels indicated that 75.4% and 67.2% met the PA goal at 6 and 12 months, 
respectively. During the intervention, participants also experienced improvements in type 2 
diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk factors including waist circumference, hemoglobin 
A1c, total and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 
which have been previously reported [48,24].
Examining changes in HRQoL reported on the EQ-5D-VAS, participants experienced a 
significant unadjusted model-estimated mean increase of +7.38 (SE=1.03) points at 6 
months and +6.73 (SE=1.06) points at 12 months (Fig. 1). As the baseline EQ-5D-VAS 
values represented adults with varying levels of HRQoL, further analysis was conducted to 
examine the changes in HRQoL for those who started with low EQ-5D-VAS scores (defined 
here as having an EQ-5D-VAS score below the estimated U.S average of 79.2). When 
limited to participants with low baseline EQ-5D-VAS scores, the improvement in the score 
was not only significant but nearly doubled in magnitude with increases of +13.69 
(SE=1.26) points at 6 months and +12.27 (SE=1.32) points at 12 months (Fig. 1).
The observed changes in EQ-5D Index values during intervention were minimal. The 
unadjusted model-estimated mean change in EQ-5D-index value was +0.00 (SE=0.01) 
points at 6 months (p=0.65) and +0.01 (SE=0.01) points at 12 months (p=0.05). When 
limited to participants who reported lower baseline EQ-5D index values (defined here as 
below the estimated U.S. average of 0.87), significant improvements of +0.04 (SE=0.01) 
points at 6 months (p<0.0001) and +0.05 (SE= 0.01) points at 12 months (p<0.0001) were 
observed.
During the intervention, the sub-sample of community center participants who completed 
the self-report survey also indicated significant improvements in perceived change in health 
over the prior 6 months (Fig. 2). At 6 and 12 months, 67.5% and 59.8% of participants 
reported ‘improved’ health, respectively (p<0.0001).

 Adjusted Estimates of Pre-Post Intervention Health-Related Quality of Life Changes
In order to examine how HRQoL was impacted by behavioral modifications, mean estimates 
of change in EQ-5D-VAS and Index values were adjusted for meeting program goals of 7% 
weight loss and 150 minutes moderate intensity PA, as well as potentially modifying 
demographic factors, program features, and respective baseline EQ-5D scores. In 
multivariate linear mixed model analysis (Table 2), the adjusted mean change estimate for 
the EQ-5D-VAS score was +11.83 (SE=1.61) points at 6 months and +11.23 (SE=1.54) 
points at 12 months (both; p<0.0001). There were significant and independent effects of 
meeting the 7% weight loss [+5.21 (SE=1.36)] and 150 minute per week PA [+3.74 
(SE=1.37)] goals on improvement in EQ-5D-VAS (both; p<0.01). Program features, 
including intervention site and delivery mode (face-to-face group or DVD), did not 
significantly affect the estimated changes in EQ-5D-VAS scores observed.
In stratified analysis of the estimated mean change in EQ-5D-VAS, age and baseline EQ-5D-
VAS score (as demonstrated in Figure 1) were significant covariates (p<0.01), and there was 
a significant interaction between age and baseline score (p=0.03). Specifically, the group of 
individuals with a lower baseline EQ-5D-VAS score (<79.2) were significantly younger 
[56.1 (SD= 10.8) years] than those with higher (≥ 79.2) baseline scores [62.2 (SD= 11.5) 
years; between group p<0.0001]. Among participants reporting lower baseline EQ-5D-VAS 
scores, those less than age 60 experienced greater improvement compared to those over age 
60 [mean age effect= +7.65 (SD=2.20); p<0.01]. Among individuals with higher baseline 
EQ-5D-VAS scores, both age groups reported similar change during intervention [mean age 
effect=+1.22 (SD=1.86); NS]. The effects of sex and educational attainment on change in 
EQ-5D-VAS were not significant (p>0.05)
In multivariate linear mixed model analysis (Table 2), the adjusted mean change estimate for 
EQ-5D Index values was +0.04 (SE=0.01) at 6 months and +0.05 (SE=0.01) at 12 months 
(both; p<0.001). There were significant independent effects of reported baseline Index score 
above the estimated U.S. average [−0.08 (SE=0.01); p<0.0001] and of age greater than or 
equal to 60 years [−0.03 (SE=0.01); p=0.01]. In this adjusted model, the effects of achieving 
program goals for 7% weight loss or 150 minutes per week of moderate PA on change in 
EQ-5D Index values were not statistically significant.
Discussion
This investigation is one of the first to describe changes in HRQoL among participants in a 
community DPP-lifestyle intervention program using a randomized-control design. 
Participants who took part in the intervention reported significantly greater improvements in 
HRQoL compared to their delayed wait-control counterparts at 6 months. In addition, 
combining both randomized groups, participants in the DPP-GLB lifestyle intervention 
program experienced improved HRQoL as well as significant weight loss and increased 
physical activity at 6 and 12 months post-intervention. These results indicate that there are 
additional benefits to community lifestyle intervention programs beyond the improvement of 
risk factors for type 2 diabetes and CVD, and demonstrate a considerable potential to 
improve public health when such programs are delivered in community settings.

 Measured by the EQ-5D-VAS, participants in this effort showed significant improvement in 
HRQoL at 6 and 12 months when compared to baseline. Limiting the analyses to 
participants whose baseline EQ-5D-VAS scores were below the reported U.S. average of 
79.2 at baseline [10], the magnitude of improvement almost doubled compared to that which 
occurred in the participants as a whole. An interesting finding of this study was that older 
adults who reported lower EQ-5D-VAS at baseline had less improvement as a result of 
intervention than younger adults did, suggesting that they may have been in poorer health 
than their younger counterparts who also reported lower baseline scores. There is no 
reported standard Minimally Important Difference (MID) for EQ-5D-VAS for those with 
pre-diabetes, however values for other conditions range from 7–12 [49,50]. It is thus likely 
that the estimated mean EQ-5D-VAS increases at 12 months of 6.73 among all participants, 
and 12.27 among those with lower scores at baseline, signify overall meaningful 
improvements in HRQoL at the group level, with variation at the individual level.
In contrast to the EQ-5D-VAS, there was minimal improvement in EQ-5D-index values after 
12 months of intervention. The incremental change observed may be due to the relatively 
high baseline value of 0.91 in this sample compared to the estimated U.S. average of 0.87 
[35]. Additionally, the EQ-5D has been shown to be less responsive when many individuals 
report no health problems in the 5 dimensions (i.e. EQ-5D index value of 1.00) [51,34], 
which was seen in this sample. However, significantly greater improvement in the EQ-5D 
index value of 0.05 was observed during the intervention when analyses were limited to the 
subset of participants with lower index values at baseline. Although an MID has not been 
reported for pre-diabetes, the EQ-5D index value MID reported for other conditions ranges 
from 0.00–0.15 [50,36,51,37], with an average of 0.07 across conditions [37]. Further use of 
the EQ-5D-3L as an instrument to assess HRQoL in persons with pre-diabetes and/or the 
metabolic syndrome is needed to better understand what changes in EQ-5D index values 
translate to clinically meaningful improvements in HRQoL in this population.
The results of this study are similar to two previous reports in which HRQoL was measured 
by different instruments. In a 6-month therapeutic lifestyle intervention for middle aged 
women with the metabolic syndrome, Oh et al. reported improved HRQoL, assessed by the 
Medical Outcome Study Short Form-36 (SF-36) in lifestyle intervention participants relative 
to the control group [52]. Cezaretto et al. demonstrated success of a lifestyle intervention for 
improving HRQoL in a 9-month program for individuals with pre-diabetes or the metabolic 
syndrome. Investigators reported significant improvements in several of the SF-36 domains 
for the intensive lifestyle intervention group, compared to baseline, with greater 
improvement in the intervention group than the control [53]. Additionally, Cezaretto et al. 
reported that changes in SF-36 scores correlated with improvements in diabetes risk factors. 
Coupled with the findings from the current investigation, it can be suggested that lifestyle 
intervention shows promise for improving HRQoL among individuals with pre-diabetes and 
the metabolic syndrome.
Though the findings of this study are supportive of the role of behavioral lifestyle changes in 
improving HRQoL, some limitations must be addressed. First, the EQ-5D-3L captures 
current health states in 5 specific dimensions, and may not represent overall health. In an 
attempt to examine the relationship to usual health, a second perceived health survey was

 administered in the community center setting that captured more global health, with similar 
improvements noted. Second, an expected within-subject cluster effect and a smaller within-
site cluster effect on the outcomes reported was observed over time. Although accounted for 
in the regression models, some residual cluster effects in the data may have impacted the 
model estimates and standard errors presented. Additionally, the interpretation of the 
findings may be affected by healthy volunteer bias [54]. Participants who volunteered to 
attend the community-based lifestyle program may have had generally better health and 
therefore better HRQoL than those who did not volunteer. However, the sub-analysis which 
demonstrated that those with lower baseline HRQoL had greater improvements on the 
EQ-5D-VAS and Index measures provides evidence that the lifestyle intervention may be 
equally as effective, if not more effective, for those who did not volunteer due to poorer 
health.
Conclusion
Identifying programs that reduce the risk for chronic disease and positively impact HRQoL 
may be beneficial in improving health in an aging U.S. population. With the physiologic 
benefits of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk reduction through lifestyle change 
well-established in clinical [12,55] and translational settings [19,56,21,57,58], these findings 
help strengthen the case for increasing the use of HRQoL assessment tools in community 
lifestyle interventions. Building on these results, future studies should include measurement 
of HRQoL and explore relationships between HRQoL and specific clinical and behavioral 
outcomes in translational diabetes prevention programs.
