IMPORTANCE Emergency department visits for skin infections in the United States have
increased with the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). For
cellulitis without purulent drainage, β-hemolytic streptococci are presumed to be the
predominant pathogens. It is unknown if antimicrobial regimens possessing in vitro MRSA
activity provide improved outcomes compared with treatments lacking MRSA activity.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole yields a
higher clinical cure rate of uncomplicated cellulitis than cephalexin alone.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter, double-blind, randomized superiority trial
in 5 US emergency departments among outpatients older than 12 years with cellulitis and no
wound, purulent drainage, or abscess enrolled from April 2009 through June 2012. All
participants had soft tissue ultrasound performed at the time of enrollment to exclude
abscess. Final follow-up was August 2012.
INTERVENTIONS Cephalexin, 500 mg 4 times daily, plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 320
mg/1600 mg twice daily, for 7 days (n = 248 participants) or cephalexin plus placebo for 7
days (n = 248 participants).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome determined a priori in the per-protocol
group was clinical cure, defined as absence of these clinical failure criteria at follow-up visits:
fever; increase in erythema (>25%), swelling, or tenderness (days 3-4); no decrease in
erythema, swelling, or tenderness (days 8-10); and more than minimal erythema, swelling, or
tenderness (days 14-21). A clinically significant difference was defined as greater than 10%.
RESULTS Among 500 randomized participants, 496 (99%) were included in the modified
intention-to-treat analysis and 411 (82.2%) in the per-protocol analysis (median age, 40 years
[range, 15-78 years]; 58.4% male; 10.9% had diabetes). Median length and width of erythema
were 13.0 cm and 10.0 cm. In the per-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 182 (83.5%)
of 218 participants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 165 (85.5%)
of 193 in the cephalexin group (difference, −2.0%; 95% CI, −9.7% to 5.7%; P = .50). In the
modified intention-to-treat population, clinical cure occurred in 189 (76.2%) of 248 participants
in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole group vs 171 (69.0%) of 248 in the
cephalexin group (difference, 7.3%; 95% CI, −1.0% to 15.5%; P = .07). Between-group adverse
event rates and secondary outcomes through 7 to 9 weeks, including overnight hospitalization,
recurrent skin infections, and similar infection in household contacts, did not differ significantly.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with uncomplicated cellulitis, the use of
cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared to cephalexin alone did not result
in higher rates of clinical resolution of cellulitis in the per-protocol analysis. However, because
imprecision around the findings in the modified intention-to-treat analysis included a
clinically important difference favoring cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,
further research may be needed.

 E
mergency department visits for skin and soft tissue
infections in the United States have increased with the
emergence of community-associated methicillin-
resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).1,2 Cellulitis repre-
sents a unique type of skin and soft tissue infection for which
it is usually not possible to determine the bacterial etiology
because of a lack of a diagnostic specimen. Despite use of
blood cultures and serology,3,4 tissue specimens with con-
ventional culture,5 and molecular diagnostic testing,6 the eti-
ology of presumed infectious cellulitis has been difficult to
determine definitively; however, β-hemolytic streptococci
are presumed to be the predominant pathogens for cellulitis
without purulent drainage. In a 2006 report, MRSA was the
most common cause of purulent skin infections in the United
States,7 although the etiologic role and current prevalence of
MRSA cellulitis are unclear.
The Infectious Diseases Society of America practice
guidelines recommend that patients with cellulitis and with-
out systemic signs of infection, penetrating trauma, evidence
of MRSA elsewhere, or injection drug use should receive an
antimicrobial agent active only against streptococci.8 How-
ever, despite these guidelines, clinicians in the United States
frequently prescribe regimens that include MRSA activity
for cellulitis.9
To determine whether addition of a MRSA-active antimi-
crobial improves outcomes in patients with cellulitis, this ran-
domized, double-blind trial compared cephalexin plus
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazolewithcephalexinaloneamong
emergencydepartmentpatientspresentingwithcellulitiswith-
out a wound or abscess.
Methods
Design
This study was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial
to determine whether a 7-day course of oral cephalexin plus
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazoleissuperiortocephalexinalone
for outpatient treatment of patients with acute cellulitis. The
full protocol and statistical analysis plan are available in
Supplement 1. Written informed consent was obtained from
all participants. For minors, consent was obtained from a par-
ent or guardian, with a written assent obtained from minors
believed capable of understanding the assent form. Each in-
stitutional review board approved the study. Study sites are
listed in the eAppendix in Supplement 2.
Study Population
From April 2009 through June 2012, patients older than 12
yearswithuncomplicatedcellulitis,definedaspresenceofery-
thema without an abscess, purulent drainage, or wound and
believed to be of infectious etiology, were enrolled. Enroll-
ment was limited to participants with a lesion present for less
than 1 week and measuring at least 2.0 cm in diameter who
agreed to reevaluation and provided written informed con-
sent. All participants had soft tissue ultrasound performed at
the time of enrollment to exclude abscess. Patients with un-
derlying skin conditions in the affected area, history of intra-
venous drug use with fever, concurrent infection at another
site, or immunosuppression were excluded. Other exclusions
are listed in the eAppendix in Supplement 2. Follow-up data
were obtained through August 2012.
Interventions and Baseline Evaluation
Using double-blind web-based block randomization, partici-
pants were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a 7-day
course of cephalexin (one 500-mg pill 4 times daily) plus
placebo (4 pills twice daily) or cephalexin plus trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole (4 single-strength pills, 80 mg/400 mg,
twice daily). An independent contract research organization
(Emmes Corporation) performed randomization; assign-
ments were stratified by clinical site with a stratum size of 12
or 24. The randomized complete block design used randomly
permuted block sizes within each stratum. Each block had a
1:1 allocation of cephalexin:cephalexin plus trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole.
Medications were dispensed in blister packs indicating
treatment day and time. Placebo and active medications were
encapsulated in gel capsules with filler to give identical weight
and appearance. Blinding could only be broken if a partici-
pant experienced treatment failure or an adverse event for
which an acceptable alternative treatment could not be given
and knowledge of the treatment assignment was needed for
clinical care.
At the baseline evaluation, the study team recorded
medical history and results of a physical examination and
obtained detailed wound characteristics including location,
presence of tenderness, and the dimensions of erythema and
swelling/induration (eAppendix in Supplement 2). Informa-
tion on race was collected at the time of enrollment based on
participant self-report of racial identity using a form with
fixed categories. Information on race was collected in this
trial because assessment of skin erythema as an outcome
measure could potentially be more difficult in participants
with darker skin.
Key Points
Question Does cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
yield higher clinical cure rates than cephalexin alone for treatment
of patients with uncomplicated cellulitis?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 500 patients
with cellulitis, the clinical cure rate was not significantly
different between those treated with cephalexin plus
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole vs cephalexin plus placebo
(83.5% vs 85.5% in the per-protocol analysis and 76.2% vs 69.0%
in the modified intention-to-treat analysis). However, the 95%
confidence interval for the difference in the intention-to-treat
analysis was −1.0% to +15.5%, which included the minimal clinically
important difference of 10%.
Meaning Addition of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to
cephalexin did not result in a statistically significant improvement
in clinical cure for uncomplicated cellulitis. However, because the
imprecision around the findings in the modified intention-to-treat
analysis included a clinically important difference favoring the
combination, further research may be needed.

 Outcome Measures
Follow-up evaluations occurred in person (or if unable, by tele-
phone) on days 3 to 4 (during therapy), days 8 to 10 (end of
therapy), days 14 to 21 (test of clinical cure), and days 49 to 63
(extended follow-up) after enrollment. Treatment adherence
was assessed by inspecting blister packs or, if not available, a
memory aid record and participant interview.
Descriptions of study populations, including per proto-
col, modified intention to treat (mITT-1 and mITT-2), and US
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance10 early end
point, as well as definitions of clinical cure or failure are
shown in Table 1. The primary outcome was clinical cure of
cellulitis at the test-of-clinical-cure visit, 14 to 21 days after
enrollment. A participant was classified as having a clinical
cure if he/she did not meet failure criteria at or before the
test-of-clinical-cure visit. The following criteria for failure
were developed by investigator consensus prior to study ini-
tiation: fever (attributable to the infection), an increase in the
maximal dimension of erythema by more than 25% from
baseline, or worsening of swelling and tenderness by the visit
during the treatment period (day 3 or 4); fever, no decrease in
the maximal dimension of erythema from baseline or no
decrease in swelling or tenderness by the visit at the end of
the treatment period (days 8-10); and fever or more than
minimal erythema, swelling, or tenderness by the test-of-
clinical-cure visit (days 14-21). Participants meeting failure
criteria had their assigned treatment stopped and another
nonstudy antibiotic regimen started in addition to any surgi-
cal drainage deemed necessary. The mITT-1 group consisted
of participants who took at least 1 dose of study medication
and had an in-person or telephone assessment through the
test-of-clinical-cure visit, as well as those who withdrew
from the trial, were lost to follow-up before final classifica-
tion, or had missing or unassigned outcomes. For the mITT-1
analysis, participants lost to follow-up were considered to
have clinical failure; those who did not present for the test-
of-clinical-cure visit but were reached by telephone were
classified as having failure if they reported a change in anti-
biotic treatment for their cellulitis. Outcome assessment
methods are described in the eAppendix and interrater agree-
ment is described in eTable 1 in Supplement 2. Baseline
cultures were not obtained but were obtained at follow-up
visits if indicated clinically and material that could be cul-
tured was present.
Secondary outcomes planned before study initiation
included composite clinical cure (ie, resolution of all symp-
toms and signs of infection or improvement such that no
additional antibiotics and/or surgical procedures were
necessary), surgical drainage procedures, changes in ery-
thema size, presence of swelling/induration and tenderness,
invasive infections (ie, sepsis, bacteremia, endocarditis,
osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, necrotizing fasciitis, or pneu-
monia), skin infections at the same or different site, hospital-
izations, similar infections in household contacts, days
missed from normal activities and work/school, and days of
analgesic use.
Statistical Analysis
The study was designed as a superiority trial. The primary
hypothesis was that the clinical cure rate with cephalexin
plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole would be greater than
that with cephalexin alone. Assuming a 10-percentage-point
effect size, type I error rate of 5%, power of 90%, using
a 2-sided significance threshold, expected clinical cure rate

Description
Outcome Definition
Per protocol
Participants who either took ≥75% of the total
doses of study medication during the first 5 d
and had an in-person test-of-clinical-cure visit
or were determined to have had clinical failure
before the test-of-cure visit and received ≥75%
of the doses provided during the first 48 h of the
treatment period
Participants were considered to have had a clinical cure if they
did not meet the criteria for clinical failure at or before the
test-of-clinical-cure visit. The criteria for clinical failure were as
follows: fever (attributable to the infection), increase in maximal
dimension of erythema by >25% from baseline, or worsening of
swelling and tenderness by on-treatment visit (day 3 or 4); fever,
no decrease in maximal dimension of erythema from baseline,
or no decrease in swelling or tenderness by end-of-treatment visit
(days 8-10); and fever or more than minimal erythema, swelling,
or tenderness by the test-of-clinical-cure visit (days 14-21).
Modified intention to treat 1
Participants who took ≥1 dose of study medication
and had an in-person or telephone assessment at
the test-of-cure visit, as well as those who
withdrew from the trial, were lost to follow-up
before final classification, or had missing
or unassigned outcomes
Participants were considered to have had a clinical cure if they did not
meet the criteria for clinical failure (see examination criteria above)
at or before the test-of-cure visit or based on no change in antibiotic
therapy due to persistence or worsening of infection based on study
clinician assessment, the participant’
s assessment, or assessment by
an outside clinician. Participants who withdrew from the trial,
were lost to follow-up before final classification, or had missing or
unassigned outcomes were classified as having had clinical failure.
Modified intention to treat 2
Participants who took ≥1 dose of study medication
and had an in-person follow-up evaluation at any
time during the study
Participants were considered to have had a clinical cure if they did not
meet the criteria for clinical failure (see examination criteria above)
at or before the last recorded follow-up visit.

 with cephalexin of 85%,11 and 85% of enrolled patients with
evaluable outcomes, we estimated that 500 participants
would be adequate.
The primary outcome is reported as the difference in the
proportion of clinical cures between patients treated
with cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and
those treated with cephalexin alone in the per-protocol
population. The per-protocol group was chosen as the pri-
mary outcome population to optimize the accuracy of evalu-
ation of clinical response and best determine the effect of
adding trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole on clinical cure. A
greater degree of nonadherence and lack of follow-up was
anticipated in a population recruited from the emergency
department. Analyses were also performed in the mITT-1,
mITT-2, and FDA guidance early end-point populations.10
Statistical superiority for the primary end point required the
lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the differ-
ence in clinical cure rates to be greater than 0, whereas the
clinical superiority required the lower bound to be greater
than 10%. The 10% threshold was based on consensus among
investigators, who decided that in the interest of antibiotic
stewardship, increasing antibiotic use for this common infec-
tion should require strong justification.
Levels of statistical significance were computed using
a general linear mixed model with site as a random effect.
To examine potential bias due to attrition or nonadherence,
sensitivity analyses were performed by examining “best-” and
“worst-case” clinical cure rates while varying the assump-
tions regarding outcomes among participants lost to attri-
tion. In the “best-case” analysis, participants who were not
included in the per-protocol population were assigned a
clinicalcureoutcomeiftheywererandomizedtoreceivecepha-
lexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and clinical fail-
ure if they were randomized to receive only cephalexin. In the
“worst-case” analysis, participants who were not included in
theper-protocolpopulationwereassignedaclinicalfailureout-
come if they were randomized to receive cephalexin plus
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and clinical cure if they were
randomized to receive only cephalexin.
Secondary outcomes were analyzed in the per-protocol
population on an exploratory basis and between-group
differences in outcome rates are reported with associated
95% confidence intervals. Post hoc subgroup analyses were
conducted to examine clinical cure rates for participants
with history of fever, diabetes, and involved skin area of
75 cm2 or greater.
Testing was 2-sided with a significance threshold of .05.
SAS version 9.3 was used for analyses. Interim analyses
for safety and efficacy occurred at 50% and 75% of antici-
pated enrollment.
Results
Among 500 randomized participants, 248 (49.6%) received
cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 248 re-
ceived cephalexin alone, and 4 patients were excluded prior
to treatment initiation; 218 (87.9%) participants who re-
ceived cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and
193 (77.8%) who received cephalexin plus placebo qualified for
the per-protocol population, totaling 411 participants (82.2%)
(Figure 1). Of 496 participants who took at least 1 dose, 257
(51.8%) were 100% adherent (137 taking cephalexin plus
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and 120 taking cephalexin
alone) and 122 (24.6%) took 76% to 99% of doses (61 taking
cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and 61 tak-
ing cephalexin alone).
Participant characteristics in the per-protocol population
are summarized in Table 2. Median age was 40 years (range,
15-78 years), 58.4% were male. Diabetes was present in 45
participants (10.9%). Sixteen participants (3.9%) had a his-
tory of MRSA infection and 81 (19.7%) had a history of fever.
Median length and width of erythema at study entry were
13.0 cm (interquartile range [IQR], 8.0-21.0 cm; range, 2.0-
63.0 cm) and 10.0 cm (IQR, 6.0-15.0 cm; range, 1.0-65.0 cm),
respectively. Area of erythema was at least 75 cm2 in 243 par-
ticipants (59.1%).
Clinical cure rates are summarized in Figure 2. Clinical
cure occurred at 14 to 21 days after enrollment in 182 (83.5%)
of 218 participants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole group and 165 (85.5%) of 193 partici-
pants in the cephalexin group in the per-protocol population
(difference, −2.0%; 95% CI, −9.7% to 5.7%; P = .50). In the
mITT-1 population, clinical cure occurred in 189 (76.2%) of
248 participants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole group and 171 (69.0%) of 248 participants
in the cephalexin group (difference, 7.3%; 95% CI, −1.0% to
15.5%; P = .07). Clinical cure rates were not significantly dif-
ferent between the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group
and the cephalexin group in the mITT-2 population (83.8%
and 82.8%, respectively) and the FDA guidance early end-
point population (26.6% for both groups).
In the “best case” sensitivity analysis, treatment with
cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole produced
highercurerates(85.5%)thantreatmentwithcephalexinalone
(65.7%; difference, 19.8%; 95% CI, 11.9%-27.7%). In the “worst

sulfamethoxazoleproducedlowercurerates(73.1%)thantreat-
ment with cephalexin alone (88.8%; difference, −15.8%; 95%
CI, −23.1% to −8.4%).
Of 36 participants who had treatment failure with cepha-
lexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 10 (27.8%) were
found to have an abscess at the time of clinical failure and 9
(25.0%) developed opening of the skin and purulent drain-

 cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group.
One treatment-associated serious adverse event occurred in
the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group,
an acute-on-chronic kidney injury that resolved. Between-
group rates of treatment discontinuation due to treatment-
related adverse events were not significantly different
(0.4% and 1.2%, respectively).
Discussion
In this randomized trial involving 500 mostly adult partici-
pants, a regimen with activity against MRSA, cephalexin
plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, was not superior to
a regimen lacking MRSA activity, cephalexin (plus placebo).

 However, the results from the mITT-1 analysis did not ex-
clude the possibility of clinical superiority of cephalexin plus
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole;therefore,moreresearchmay
be necessary to more definitively answer this question.
Although the upper bound of the 95% confidence inter-
val of the between-group difference in clinical cure rates fa-
voring cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was
greater than the 10-percentage-point threshold deemed clini-
cally significant in the mITT-1 population, the bounds of this
confidence interval were within this threshold in the per-
protocol and mITT-2 populations. Per-protocol criteria re-
quired a physical follow-up at 14 to 21 days after enrollment
and adherence to at least 75% of the doses provided. Per-
protocol analysis optimizes the accuracy of evaluating clini-
cal response and best determines the effect of adding antimi-
crobial activity against MRSA on clinical cure for participants
who adhere to treatment. However, per-protocol analysis may
not reflect the effectiveness of a course of therapy in the clini-
cal setting, where effects such as adherence and drug intoler-
ance play a greater role.12
Because the tolerability of these antibiotics is well known
from decades of experience, and adherence was lower in the
cephalexin plus placebo group, it is less likely that drug intol-
erance led to significant postrandomization bias. Intention-
to-treat analysis avoids postrandomization bias but must as-
sign outcomes when these are unknown because of lack of
follow-up. In this study, the default approach was to assign the
outcome as failure if a participant could not be evaluated for
their 14- to 21-day postenrollment status. Another ITT ap-
proach is to assign outcomes based on participant status at last
reevaluationvisit,excludingtheremainderwithoutanyfollow-
up,whichwasthemITT-2populationinthisstudy.ThemITT-2
population accounted for more than 96% of the mITT-1 popu-
lation, and between-group differences in this population were
within the 10-percentage-point threshold. The best-case and
worst-case analyses gave disparate results showing benefit for
each treatment group.
Fewstudieshaveevaluatedoralantibioticregimenstotreat

In a randomized trial of 153 adults with cellulitis without ab-
scess, Pallin et al11 reported a clinical cure rate of 85% with
cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and 82%
withcephalexin(difference,2.7%).Therelativelysmallsample
size in this study allowed for a between-group difference of
15%, there was no minimum lesion size, lesions could have up
to 1 mL of purulent drainage, and patients with common co-
morbidities were excluded. In a retrospective study in chil-
dren with skin infections that were not cultured or drained,
Elliott et al13 reported that clindamycin and β-lactams were
equally effective and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was as-
sociated with a slightly higher failure rate. In a prospective
study by Jeng et al4 of nonculturable cellulitis among hospi-
talizedadults,overallclinicalresponseratetoβ-lactamtherapy
was 96%. The outcomes in that study were not specifically de-
fined,investigatorsgradingoutcomeswerenotblindedtotreat-
ment, and there was no comparison group.
In contrast, the current trial focused on patients with cel-
lulitis without abscess or wound and no diagnostic specimen
available for culture. This trial was powered to detect a differ-
enceinclinicalcureratesof10%.Tobetterreflecttypicalemer-
gency department outpatient cellulitis management, pa-

Specificfailurecriteriaweredefinedbasedonfeverandchanges

beenvalidated,buttherearenovalidatedmethodsforskinand
soft tissue infection evaluation, and the criteria in this trial are
easy for clinicians to follow, with demonstrated good interob-
server agreement on clinical cure or failure.
Methicillin-resistant S aureus was cultured in 41 patients
who had treatment failure (10% of the per-protocol popula-
tion), suggesting that MRSA plays a role in some cases of cel-
lulitis. These cases likely represent small abscesses missed
on ultrasound screening or were abscesses in evolution. Clini-
cally, cases diagnosed as cellulitis are occasionally observed
in which there is notable induration and sometimes a sugges-
tion of fluctuance with a central pustule, which subsequently
progresses to an abscess. Drainage is key to abscess resolu-
tion, and MRSA is the predominant cause of these infections.
Therefore, because of this phenomenon, a small proportion
of cellulitis cases are expected to have antibiotic treat-
ment failure, including with MRSA-active drugs. In this trial,

 the proportion was probably minimized because participants
were screened with ultrasound to identify occult fluid collec-
tions consistent with an abscess and excluded. Empirical treat-
ment with MRSA activity did not achieve superior outcomes
overall, and an equal proportion of MRSA was found among
clinical failures in each treatment group.
This investigation has limitations. First, the Infectious
Diseases Society of America skin infection guidelines recom-
mendantibioticregimenswithactivityagainstMRSAwhencel-
lulitis is accompanied by systemic signs of infection, penetrat-
ingtrauma,evidenceofMRSAelsewhere,orhistoryofinjection
drug use.8 Although enrollment of individuals with some of
these conditions was allowed in the current study, clinicians
may have been biased against their participation, thus leav-
ing a selected population that was at relatively lower risk of
treatment failure.
Second, even with 500 participants, the power of this
trial is limited such that the possibility that regimens with
activity against MRSA could improve outcomes in some sub-
groups cannot be excluded. Third, the most recent data were
collected 5 years ago, and it is unknown whether the findings
reflect the bacteriology or antimicrobial susceptibility of cel-
lulitis among patients currently treated in emergency depart-
ments. However, in a prior study, MRSA prevalence and sus-
ceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole did not change
over a 4-year interval (2004-2008) at these sites.14 Fourth, to
try to ensure accurate diagnosis of cellulitis without abscess,
bedside ultrasound was used to exclude an occult fluid col-
lection. Although most US emergency departments have bed-
side ultrasound available, this may not be available in some
settings; these findings should be cautiously applied to
patients in whom abscess is not identified based on physical
examination alone.
Fifth,intheper-protocolpopulation,nearly3timesasmany
participants randomized to cephalexin plus placebo vs cepha-
lexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were nonadher-
ent, which may suggest insufficient blinding. The imbalance of
the proportion evaluable per-protocol between the treatment
groups was largely attributable to this difference in adherence.
Even with this imbalance, significant outcome differences fa-
voringthelattergroupwerenotobserved.Anothermuchlarger
trial comparing trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and placebo
that used the same masking did not find this difference in
adherence.15 There is no reason to believe that treatment with
2 antibiotics would be better tolerated by patients than treat-
mentwith1antibiotic.Sixth,althoughbasedonreportsofpoorly
described populations in the preantibiotic era, the rate of spon-
taneous resolution of cellulitis has been reported to be as high
as 66%,16 which could bias these results toward the null hy-
pothesis. It has been suggested that many cases of cellulitis are
misdiagnosed and are instead noninfectious conditions, such
as stasis dermatitis.17 It is possible that some participants did
not truly have an infection, but these participants likely reflect
those treated for cellulitis in typical practice.
Conclusions
Amongpatientswithuncomplicatedcellulitis,theuseofcepha-
lexin plus trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole compared with
cephalexin alone did not result in higher rates of clinical reso-
lution of cellulitis in the per-protocol analysis. However, be-
cause the imprecision around the findings in the mITT analy-
sis included a clinically important difference favoring
cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, further
research may be needed.
