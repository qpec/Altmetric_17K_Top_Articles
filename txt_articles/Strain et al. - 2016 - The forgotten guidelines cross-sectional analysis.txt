Abstract
Background: In 2011, the UK physical activity guidelines were updated to include recommendations for muscle
strengthening and balance & coordination (at least two sessions of relevant activities per week). However, monitoring
and policy efforts remain focussed on aerobic activity. This study aimed to assess differences by gender and age
in the a) prevalence of muscle strengthening and balance & co-ordination guidelines, and b) participation in
guideline-specific activities.
Methods: The sample for the muscle strengthening analyses was 10,488 adult (16–64 years) and 3857 older adult
(≥65 years) 2012–2014 Scottish Health Survey respondents. The balance & co-ordination analyses used only the
older adult responses. Differences by gender and (where possible) age in guideline prevalence and activity
participation were assessed using logistic regression and t-tests.
Results: Thirty-one percent of men and 24 % of women met the muscle strengthening guideline, approximately
half that of published figures for aerobic physical activity. Nineteen percent of older men and 12 % of older
women met the balance & co-ordination guidelines. The oldest age groups were less likely to meet both guidelines
compared to the youngest age groups. Differences by gender were only evident for muscle strengthening: more men
met the guidelines than women in all age groups, with the largest difference amongst 16–24 year olds (55 % men
compared with 40 % women). Participation in relevant activities differed by gender for both guidelines. ‘Workout at
gym’ was the most popular activity to improve muscle strength for men (18 % participated), while swimming was for
women (15 % participated). Golf was the most popular activity to improve balance & co-ordination for older men
(11 % participated) and aerobics was for older women (6 % participated). Participation decreased in most muscle
strengthening activities for both men and women. One exception was golf, where participation levels were as
high amongst older men as in younger age groups, although overall levels were low (3 % of all men).
Conclusions: Physical activity policy should aim to increase prevalence of these ‘forgotten’ guidelines, particularly
amongst young women (for muscle strengthening) and older age groups (both guidelines). Gender and age
participation differences should be considered when designing population-level interventions.

 Background
Increasing physical activity (PA) levels is a health priority
in Scotland [1]. Progress is monitored by the proportion
of the population undertaking the recommended amount
of moderate and vigorous aerobic PA [2]. Until recently,
the Scottish PA guidelines for adults focused only on
aerobic activity. In 2011, the guidelines were updated
to include recommendations on muscle strengthening
(MS), balance & co-ordination (BC; for older adults
(≥65 years) at risk of falls), and sedentary behaviour [3].
This paper focuses on MS and BC. The relevant add-
itional recommendations are:
� Those over the age of 19 should undertake two
sessions of MS activities per week, and
�
Those over the age of 65 who are at risk of falls
should undertake two sessions of BC activities per
week [3].
(see Table 1 for a list of the activities that were
considered to improve MS and/or BC).
The inclusion of the MS guidelines for adults was in
response to the growing evidence base showing that
higher levels of muscle strength are associated with a re-
duced risk of premature mortality and cardiovascular
disease across all ages, independent of aerobic PA levels
[4–6]. There are also metabolic benefits to undertaking
regular MS activities, such as improved insulin action,
blood glucose control, and fat oxidation, all of which are
critical in the prevention and treatment of type 2 dia-
betes and metabolic syndrome [7, 8]. There is tentative
evidence to suggest MS activities improve self-esteem
[9], and ameliorate symptoms of depression and anxiety
[10, 11].
In older adults, MS activities limit the age-related de-
cline in lean muscle mass (sarcopenia), help prevent
osteoporosis, maintain functional capacity and reduce
risk of falls [12–15]. Older adults may further reduce
their risk of falls by undertaking BC activities [16, 17].
Studies in New Zealand and USA have found that
around one-third of community-dwelling older adults
fall each year [18, 19]. Considering the health and eco-
nomic burden related to falls is high [14], this issue
needs to be addressed.
In response to the additional guidelines, the Scottish
national surveillance questionnaire (the Scottish Health
Survey (SHeS)) was expanded so the MS activities of
adults and older adults, and the BC activities of older
adults could be monitored annually [20]. Whilst the
SHeS records aerobic PA under the domains of walking,
housework, heavy manual/Do-it-yourself home mainten-
ance/gardening, occupational, and sport and exercise, des-
ignated MS and BC activities only appear within the sport
and exercise domain [20] (full list in Table 1). Therefore,
we use the terms MS and BC sport and exercise activities
in this paper.
So far, the SHeS annual reports have only published
descriptive statistics on the proportion of adults and
older adults meeting the MS guidelines (27 % in 2012
[20]). There has been no statistical examination of the
differences by age and gender, nor any analysis as to
what MS sport and exercise activities adults and older
adults undertake. There has been no analysis relating to
the BC guidelines. This paper addresses these omissions
by assessing whether there are any important and sta-
tistically significant differences by gender and (where
possible given available bases) age group in:
i) the MS and BC guideline prevalence (and the
proportions that undertaking no or insufficient
activities)
ii) the participation levels in specific MS and BC sport
and exercise activities.
This will provide a baseline from which progress can
be monitored, suggest which activities are important in
different sub-groups, and highlight sub-groups most in
need of policy focus and intervention.
Methods
Data source
We obtained the 2012-2013-2014 SHeS combined dataset
from the UK data archive on 17th December 2015 [21].
The SHeS uses a two-stage stratified clustered sampling
design to select households for participation in an
interviewer-led
computer
assisted
interview.
After
weighting, the data are nationally representative of the
population living in private households in Scotland in
2012, 2013, and 2014. Further details on the sampling
design and survey methods are in the SHeS Technical
Report [22].
Measurement of muscle strengthening and balance &
co-ordination activities in the Scottish Health Survey
Adult respondents to the SHeS were asked to report the
frequency (in the 28 days prior to interview) and average
duration of any sport and exercise activities that they
undertook. Over 40 sport and exercise activities were
prompted and they were given the opportunity to report
any others (for further details see Corbett et al. (2013)
[23]). A panel of experts was convened to determine
whether the prompted sport and exercise activities could
count towards the MS and/or the BC guidelines [20].
Table 1 displays the three categories that they were al-
located to: a) definitely a MS/BC sport and exercise
activity, b) only a MS/BC sport and exercise activity if
the respondent confirms in a follow up question, c) not a
MS/BC sport and exercise activity. The follow up question
Strain et al. BMC Public Health  (2016) 16:1108 
Page 2 of 12
 for MS activities was “During the past four weeks, was the
effort of (name of activity) usually enough to make your
muscles feel some tension, shake or feel warm?” There
was only one BC activity to require a follow-up question
(exercises). The follow-up question to this activity was
“Did these exercises involve you standing up and moving
about?” The construct validity of this method has not been
tested but we are unaware of any other validated method
of assessing prevalence meeting national MS or the BC
guidelines.
A respondent was deemed to have met the MS or the
BC guidelines if they reported undertaking an average of
≥2 sessions of MS or BC sport and exercise activities re-
spectively per week in the preceding 28 days. This is
based on the assumption that the sessions took place on
separate days. The UK PA guidelines do not specify a
recommended bout length for MS or BC activities [3]
and so the reported duration of activity was not taken
into account. We calculated the proportions (1) achiev-
ing or exceeding these guidelines, (2) participating in
some MS or BC sport and exercise activities but not suf-
ficiently to meet the guidelines, or (3) not participating
in any MS or BC sport and exercise activities.
Finally, we calculated the proportions that reported
participating in each individual MS and BC sport and
exercise activity in 28 days prior to interview. For category
(b) activities where a follow up question was required to
confirm that the activity was relevant, respondents only
counted as participants if the answer was affirmative.
Sample characteristics
There were 10,509 adult (16–64 years) and 3857 older
adult (≥65 years) respondents to the 2012, 2013 and
2014 SHeSs. These were analysed together for the MS
analyses. Those aged 16–18 were included in the ana-
lysis in line with UK health survey reporting although
the PA guidelines defines adults as 19–64 years [3]. Only

 older adults were included in the BC analyses as the
guideline only applies to this age group. It was not pos-
sible to identify those at risk of falls (the exact target
group for the recommendation) and so we have analysed
the data for all those over the age of 65.
Ten respondents were excluded from the MS analyses
and one from the BC analyses as they did not answer
the PA questions relating to sport and exercise. If there
were missing data for a specific MS or BC sport and ex-
ercise activity, the respondent was kept in the overall
analysis but that activity did not count towards the
weekly total. Twelve further respondents were excluded
from the MS analysis and one from the BC analysis as
they averaged over 3 sessions per day for the previous
28 days. We considered these individuals as extreme
outliers and not representative of normal populations.
The MS analyses by age group used 10-year groups in
line with standard health survey reporting; 5-year age
groups were used for the BC analyses to provide further
insight in the already restricted age range. Table 2 shows
the unweighted and weighted sample sizes for the age
and gender sub-groups (Table 2).
Statistical analyses
Analyses were carried out using STATA/SE v14.1 using
the ‘svyset’ commands to account for the design effects
of the complex sampling strategy, following the recom-
mendations of Heeringa et al. (2010) [24].
Multiple logistic regressions were performed on the
proportions undertaking no, some, or sufficient MS or
BC sport and exercise activities with the predictors age
group, gender, and an interaction term. Significant dif-
ferences compared to the reference category (youngest
age group and males for the predictors respectively)
were identified through Wald tests for the regression
coefficients.
T-tests were performed to assess gender differences in
the proportions taking part in the MS and BC sport and
exercise activities (if the overall proportion participating
was ≥1 %) using the ‘lincom’ command. Simple logistic
regressions were used to test the differences in the pro-
portions taking part in MS sport and exercise activities
by age group, stratified by gender. Regressions were only
undertaken if the activity featured in the top five for any
age category for that gender. This was not possible for the
BC sport and exercise activities as the sample sizes were
too small.
A conservative Bonferroni adjusted α-level of 0.0003
was used to account for the large number of compari-
sons being made (184 test statistics). However, our con-
clusions have taken into account overall trends in the
interpretation of the data and we comment only where
differences appear to be of practical importance. One
should be cautious interpreting these data based solely
on this cut-off for statistical significance and therefore
have provided the exact p-values and 95 % confidence

Results
Muscle strength
The proportions of men and women in Scotland in
2012–14 meeting the MS guidelines were 31 and 24 %
respectively (Fig. 1, Additional file 1: Table S1). The pro-
portions were highest amongst the youngest age group
16–24 year olds (57 % of males and 38 % of females); all
other age groups were significantly less likely to meet
the guidelines. The proportions decreased with age with
the lowest amongst the over 75 s (9 % of men and 4 %
of women in this age group). Men were more likely to
meet the guidelines than women across all age groups,
with the exception 35–44 year olds where the statistically
significant interaction effect implied the 2 percentage
point difference between the genders is with the range of
variance.
The proportion doing some MS sport and exercise
activities but at an insufficient frequency (>0 but <2
sessions per week over previous 28 days) to meet the
guidelines ranged between 17 and 28 % for both genders
between the ages of 16 and 54 years, before declining
to 7 % for men and 5 % for women over 75 years. The
difference between the youngest and oldest age groups
was significant. Men were more likely to undertake
some MS sport and exercise activities than women in
the youngest age group (17 % for men and 28 % for
women aged 16–24 years). Although the only interaction
effect to meet our conservative α-level was for 55–64 year
olds (implying no effect of gender in this age group), the
difference between the genders was a maximum of two
percentage points in all other (non-reference category) age
groups.
The proportion undertaking no MS sport and exercise
activities per week increased with age from 26 % of men
and 34 % of women aged 16–24 to 84 % of men and 91 %
of women over 75 years. This was significantly higher for
those over the age of 35 compared with the youngest age
group. There were no significant effects of gender, or
interaction between gender and age group.
Figure 2 shows the participation levels (at least 1 ses-
sion in the previous 28 days) by gender for individual
MS sport and exercise activities that had an overall
prevalence ≥1 %. Men were more likely to participate in

 ‘workout at gym’ (including weight training and exercise
bike), exercises, running/jogging, cycling, football/rugby,
tennis/badminton, golf, climbing, squash, and martial arts
(including tai chi); women were more likely to participate
in aerobics/gymnastics, yoga/pilates, dancing, and horse-
riding. The difference between the genders in participation
levels was not significant for swimming, hill walking/ram-
bling, skiing/snowboarding, and basketball.
Table 3 shows the proportion participating in the top
five MS sport and exercise activities in each age group,
stratified by gender (see also Additional file 1: Table S2).
The proportions of both genders taking part in ‘workout
at gym’ (including weight training and exercise bike), ex-
ercises, and running/jogging were significantly lower
after the age of 35 compared to those aged 16–24. The
decline was later in swimming for both genders; participa-
tion levels were significantly lower for men over 65 years
and women over 55 years. Hill walking/rambling partici-
pation was maintained for both men and women up until
the 65–74 age group. It decreased for both sexes amongst
those over 75 years, although technically not significant for
men at the conservative Bonferroni-adjusted α-level. Golf
participation levels increased in the middle age groups for
men, and there were similar participation levels amongst
the youngest and oldest age groups. However, note that
overall participation levels were low (3 % of all men, Fig. 2).
Football and cycling participation levels were lower for men
after the age of 25 and 55 respectively, compared to 16–24
year olds. Dancing participation declined for women after
35 years, whilst aerobics participation was significantly
lower for women after the age of 55.
Balance & co-ordination
The proportion of older adults meeting the BC guide-
lines in Scotland in 2012–14 was 19 % and 12 % for
men and women respectively (Fig. 3, Additional file 1:
Table S3). The proportion decreased steadily with age,
from 25 % of men and 18 % of women aged 65–69 to 8 %
of men and 2 % of women aged over 85 years, although
the only significant difference was between the youngest
and oldest age groups. There was no overall effect of
gender nor any interaction effects.
The proportion undertaking some BC sport and exer-
cise activities but at an insufficient frequency did not
vary by age group or gender, ranging between 3 and
16 %. The proportion doing no BC sport and exercise
activities increased with age from 60 % of men and 65 %
of women aged 65–69 to 89 % of men and 94 % of
women aged over 85 years. The proportions were signifi-
cantly higher for those over the age of 80 compared to

 the youngest age group. There was no effect of gender
or any interaction between gender and age group.
Figure 4 shows that the participation levels for older
adults were low across all BC sport and exercise activ-
ities. Golf was the most popular BC sport and exercise
activity for men but it had the greatest difference be-
tween the genders (11 % of older men versus 2 % of
older women). Aerobics/Gymnastics (including ‘keep fit’
and ‘dance for fitness’) was the most popular activity for
older women with only 6 % taking part.
Discussion
Summary of findings
This is the first paper to provide detailed nationally rep-
resentative information on the proportions meeting MS
and BC guidelines amongst adults and older adults, by
age and gender. We found that the oldest age groups
were less likely to meet either guidelines compared to
the youngest age groups. However, significant differences
by gender were only evident for MS (more men met the
guidelines than women across all age groups). Participa-
tion in individual MC or BC sport and exercise activities
varied by gender and age group.
Muscle strengthening
Approximately half as many adults and older adults in
Scotland meet the MS guidelines (31 % of men and 24 %
of women) compared to the aerobic PA guidelines (71 %
men and 58 % of women [25]) in 2013. This calls into
question whether the current focus on aerobic PA is ap-
propriate particularly given the strong evidence demon-
strating the health benefits of MS activities [4–6].
Few countries report nationally representative estimates
for the proportion meeting the MS guidelines. Even
amongst those that do measure relevant activities at a
population level, there are large variations in the definitions
and surveillance methods used, which may be obscuring or
amplifying real differences. This is important to highlight
given the number of inter-country PA comparisons that
take place (e.g. GoPA! Country Cards [26], Active Healthy
Kids Country Cards [27], the Global Burden of Disease
studies [28]).
Within the UK there is a degree of consensus with
both England and Northern Ireland using comparable
methods to the SHeS [29, 30]. The proportions meeting
the MS guidelines reported in this study are similar to
those reported for England in 2012 (34 % of men and
24 % of women) [29] but are higher than Northern
Ireland in 2013/14 (25 % of men and 14 % of women)
[30]. In the USA, participants of the National Health
Interview Survey are asked how often they do leisure-time
physical activities specifically designed to strengthen their
muscles such as lifting weights or doing calisthenics [31].
The 2014 survey estimated that 28 % of men and 20 % of

 women in the USA undertook a sufficient quantity of MS
activities to meet the guidelines [32]. In Australia, different
surveys use different methods and the estimates for the
proportion of adults meeting the MS guidelines range be-
tween 9 and 19 % [33, 34].
Our findings highlight three key groups for policy
focus and intervention. Firstly, promotion efforts should
be focussed on women, particularly in the youngest age
groups. We found the largest percentage point difference
between the sexes was amongst 16–24 year olds (57 %
compared with 38 %). This is concerning as bone and
muscle mass peak in early adulthood and MS activities
at this stage in life could help to maximise this and play
a role in the prevention of osteoporosis. Both bone and
muscle mass have been shown to decrease with age from
the mid-20s, with an accelerated decline from age 50 on-
wards [13, 35]. This is apparent in both men and women,
although hormonal changes associated with the meno-
pause can further exacerbate the decline for women
[13, 35]. Coupled with the fact that women, on average,
have a smaller muscle mass than men, this means they
tend to cross ‘thresholds for independence’ (the point
at which a task cannot be completed independently)
earlier [36].
Secondly, the proportions undertaking no MS sport
and exercise activities over the age of 75 (84 % of men
and 91 % of women) are concerning as muscle strength
is of particular importance to older adults. One reason
for this is because of the natural age-related decline of
lean muscle mass (termed sarcopenia) [12]. Studies have
estimated the decline to be around 2–4 % per year
amongst those over 75 years, but the loss of strength
can be 2–5 times faster than that because of other dele-
terious changes to muscle quality and neural factors
[37]. This loss means that it can be muscle strength that
is the primary limiting factor for functional independ-
ence [35], rather than aerobic PA. Low levels of muscle
strength increase the risk of falling and sustaining a re-
lated injury, can lead to disability, and frailty [14, 38], all
of which have implications for the individual, their
carers, and the health services that support them.
Strength training has been shown to be equally effective
at increasing muscle strength in older adults as in youn-
ger adults, sometimes more so [39].

 Thirdly, the 18 % of men and 19 % of women that
undertook some but not a sufficient number of sessions
of MS sport and exercise activities per week are targets
where successful intervention may be more likely. If re-
lated to the trans-theoretical model, then these individuals
could be considered to be in the ‘maintenance’ phase (i.e.
already undertaking a relevant behaviour) [40]. It is po-
tentially easier for them to increase the frequency of
this behaviour to the recommended levels than for
those not currently undertaking any to start.
The differences by gender and age of participation in
MS sport and exercise activities are similar to the overall
participation levels for sport and exercise activities in
Scotland [41]. From this we can infer that, for those ac-
tivities that require a follow up question to confirm they
are a relevant activity, the responses do not vary greatly
by age or gender. This suggests that efforts to narrow
overall participation gaps go some way to reducing the
inequalities in the prevalence of the MS guideline. Our
results also highlight hill-walking (for both genders) and
golf (for men) as two activities where participation levels
are maintained in the older age groups. These are poten-
tially important intervention activities as it has been
shown that sustained participation in MS exercise, starting
at a young age, provides the greatest protection against
sarcopenia [42].
Although the UK PA guidelines for adults apply from
aged 19 [3], we included 16–18 year olds in our analyses
as this aligns with UK health survey reporting and
provides more useful information to policymakers. We
have undertaken a comprehensive sensitivity analysis:
their inclusion makes a ≤1 percentage point difference
to the proportions doing no, some and sufficient MS
exercise amongst 16–24 year olds and does not change
any overall conclusions. The UK guideline relating to
MS for 5–18 year olds is combined with that for vigorous
intensity aerobic activity: ‘Vigorous intensity activities,
including those that strengthen muscle and bone, should
be incorporated at least 3 days a week’ [3]. Given that,
if anything, these MS guidelines are greater than for
those ≥19 years, we do not feel that this is an unfair
misrepresentation.
Balance & co-ordination
We found that less than a fifth of older adults in
Scotland (19 % of older men and 12 % of older women)
met the BC guidelines in 2012–14. We found no differ-
ences in participation by gender, but a decline in the old-
est two age groups. However, with such low levels of
participation, we recommend that promotion efforts are
aimed at all older adults rather than any specific groups.
Loss of the ability to balance is associated with a higher
risk of falling and subsequent injury, which in turn can
lead to loss of independence, illness, and premature mor-
tality [43]. BC activities have been shown to be a critical
part of an effective falls prevention programme [38]. One
meta-analysis concluded that up to 42 % of falls could be

and ‘dance for fitness’

Page 9 of 12
 prevented by a well-designed exercise programme that in-
cluded BC activities [44].
Although the BC guideline applies to older adults at
risk of falls [3], we included all older adults in our ana-
lyses as we were not able identify this ‘at risk’ group from
the SHeS. This may have over- or under-estimated the
proportions meeting the guideline. If those who are not
at risk do not participate in any relevant activities then
our estimates maybe lower than the true proportion.
However, those who are not at risk may be more active,
leading to an overestimation. We recommend that the
target population of this guidelines is clarified, as this
may hamper any co-ordinated effort to tackle the very
low prevalence.
Strengths and limitations
This study is the first to provide detailed analysis of the
two forgotten guidelines: MS and BC. We have used
routinely collected data to describe the current preva-
lence levels and identify key groups most in need of
intervention. This is important information to take to
policymakers to support the case for addressing these is-
sues at a population level. Policy makers in Scotland use
the results from national surveillance instruments to
make decisions on funding and strategy [45]. Therefore
it is appropriate to use these same data in this analysis,
as it has most relevance for future policy decisions. The
face validity of the SHeS method of measuring prevalence
of population meeting the MS and BC guidelines is
questionable as it is limited to sport and exercise activities.
Although this is more inclusive than other national ap-
proaches to measuring MS that are often restricted to
weight training or activities that would be categorised in
the domain of sport and exercise [34, 46, 47]. Activities
such as heavy gardening and carrying heavy loads are not
included despite being listed as example activities in the
guideline document itself [3]. Another limitation of the
SHeS questionnaire is that certain activities are grouped
together or cover a wide range of activities (e.g. workout
at gym/weight training/exercise bike, or exercises) and it is
not possible to establish which of the activities was under-
taken and what exactly they involved.
As with all surveys, errors may arise at any stage: design,
data collection, processing, and analysis [48]. One that is
difficult to account for is the self-report nature of the data.
It is possible that the reported levels of MS and BC activ-
ities differ from the true levels [49]. We add our support to
calls to reach an international consensus over which activ-
ities should count towards the guidelines, how best to
measure them at a population level [34], how to ensure
they are of sufficient intensity, and then to investigate valid-
ation methods so that the degree of error can be better
understood. Other factors such as sampling error or non-
response bias are mitigated by the weighting procedures
that result in a nationally representative sample on key
demographic variables (see Bromley et al. (2015) for further
details [22]). However, there remains a degree of uncer-
tainty around the estimates and this should be considered
in their interpretation.
Conclusion
Our findings suggest that proportions meeting MS and BC
guidelines are much lower than their aerobic counterpart.
The promotion of PA should include efforts to increase the
proportions meeting these forgotten guidelines. Particular
efforts should be made amongst young women (for MS)
and the older age groups (for MS and BC). Failure to do so
could have important consequences as by 2031, the num-
ber of people over the age of 75 in Scotland is projected to
rise by 75 % [50]. This will have implications for us as indi-
viduals and as a society if we do not change population
levels of the many risk factors of ill health, of which
strength and balance are two [4, 5, 16]. The most popular
activities varied by gender and age and this should be con-
sidered when designing interventions. We also recommend
further work on how best to monitor MS and BC activities
at a population level.
