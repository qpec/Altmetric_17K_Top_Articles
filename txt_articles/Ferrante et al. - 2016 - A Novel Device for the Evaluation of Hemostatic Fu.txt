Abstract
Major surgical procedures often result in significant intra and postoperative bleeding. The ability 
to identify the cause of the bleeding has the potential to reduce the transfusion of blood products 
and improve patient care. We present a novel device, the Quantra™ Hemostasis Analyzer, which 
has been designed for automated, rapid, near patient monitoring of hemostasis. The Quantra is

 based on SEER Sonorheometry, a proprietary technology that uses ultrasound to measure clot time 
and clot stiffness from changes in viscoelastic properties of whole blood during coagulation. We 
present results of internal validation and analytical performance testing of the technology and 
demonstrate the ability to characterize the key functional components of hemostasis.
Technical Communication
A number of in vitro diagnostic devices, such as the TEG® 5000 (TEG) (Haemonetics 
Corporation, Braintree, MA) and the ROTEM® Delta (ROTEM) (Tem Innovation GmbH, 
Munich, Germany), have been shown to be useful in aiding the management of bleeding and 
guiding transfusion decisions in surgery and trauma, with multiple studies demonstrating 
significant reductions in blood product utilization and hospital costs1-9. Both the TEG and 
the ROTEM are viscoelastic devices that measure the time dependent evolution of clot 
stiffness. A series of parameters can be calculated from the time-stiffness curves to describe 
some aspects of clot formation, dynamics of clot stiffening, final clot stiffness, and clot 
dissolution. These devices, however, have a number of limitations including the complexity 
of operation and interpretation of results10-12. Furthermore, studies have found that the large 
shear stress applied by these instruments during measurements might disrupt clot 
formation13,14.
In this work we introduce a novel device, the Quantra™ Hemostasis Analyzer (Quantra) 
(HemoSonics LLC, Charlottesville, VA), which has been designed for automated, rapid, near 
patient monitoring of hemostasis. The Quantra is based on SEER (Sonic Estimation of 
Elasticity via Resonance) Sonorheometry, a proprietary technology that uses ultrasound to 
measure the changes in viscoelastic properties of whole blood during coagulation ex vivo. 
Corey and Walker15 describe SEER Sonorheometry in details, whereas other 
Sonorheometric technologies are described elsewhere16,17. We provide a summary of the 
Quantra analyzer and SEER Sonorheometry, presents initial results showing the system 
analytical performance, and demonstrate its ability to characterize the functional role of the 
treatable components of coagulation.
Methods
The studies presented here were approved by MaGil Institutional Review Board (Rockville, 
MD), under protocol #0001 Version 1.0. All participating subjects provided written 
informed consent.
Device Description
The Quantra is an automated instrument that controls all aspects of test sequence, including 
temperature control, fluidic handling, ultrasound transmission and acquisition, data 
processing, and data output. The Quantra incorporates an embedded processor, a mechanical 
assembly that provides connection to a peristaltic pump and solenoid valves, heating 
elements to heat and maintain the samples at 37°C, and ultrasound transducers operating in 
the megahertz range. Research Use Only (RUO) development versions of the Quantra, 
shown in Figure 1, were used for the reported experiments.

 A multi-well plastic cartridge with embedded reagents is used for each test (Figure 1). The 
RUO cartridge has four test channels that perform four parallel and independent 
measurements using different reagent combinations in each channel. The cartridge includes 
a connection mechanism for attachment of a sample container (a 3ml syringe for research 
purposes). After the cartridge is inserted into the analyzer and a syringe is attached to the 
cartridge, all the pre-analytical steps of sample heating, metering, and mixing are automated 
by the analyzer.
The Quantra Surgical Cartridge uses the reagents listed in Table 1. The first channel is 
optimized for the measurements of Clot Time, whereas the second channel measures 
Heparinase Clot Time using heparinase I to neutralize any potential heparin in the sample. 
Clot Time provides an indication of the functional status of the coagulation factors that lead 
to fibrin formation. Furthermore, Clot Time and Heparinase Clot Time can be combined to 
form a Clot Time Ratio, which is used to determine the presence of residual heparin in the 
sample. Channel 3 is optimized for the measurement of Clot Stiffness, which combines 
information about platelets and fibrinogen function. Finally, channel 4 is optimized to 
measure the Fibrinogen Contribution to clot stiffness. Both channels 3 and 4 use 
hexadimethrine bromide to neutralize residual heparin. The difference between Clot 
Stiffness and Fibrinogen Contribution represents the Platelet Contribution to clot 
stiffness18,19. The Quantra test results are summarized in Table 2. Figure 2 shows 
representative shear modulus vs time curves obtained with the Surgical Cartridge. The upper 
panel shows curves obtained from a normal subject but in the presence of 6 IU of 
unfractionat heparin in the sample. The bottom panel shows curves obtained from a sample 
with reduced fibrinogen levels. The device is designed to generate complete test results 
within 15 minutes of test initiation.
SEER Sonorheometry
SEER Sonorheometry is a patented technology that uses high frequency ultrasound pulses to 
quantify the shear modulus (i.e., stiffness) of a blood sample during the process of 
coagulation15. The shear modulus is a parameter that describes the elastic properties of a 
solid material20. For example, the shear modulus of bone tissue is around 3.3 GPa, whereas 
natural rubber is typically around 600 Pa. The technology is shown schematically in Figure 
3.
A focused ultrasound pulse is transmitted into the blood sample to generate a shear wave, 
causing the sample to resonate once the clot begins to form (left panel). As the clot vibrates 
during resonance, a series of “tracking” ultrasound pulses are transmitted and the returning 
echoes are analyzed to estimate the sample's motion (middle panel). The shape of the 
estimated displacement curve is directly related to the shear modulus of the sample. The 
time-displacement curve can be compared to theoretical models to determine the actual 
shear modulus for that specific point in time. Repeated acquisitions over time form a 
signature curve that shows the dynamic changes in shear modulus of the sample during 
coagulation (right panel). From this curve, the start of clot formation, or clot time, and the 
stiffness of the clot can be directly estimated. The combination of these two parameters

 provides information about the functional role of the coagulation factors, fibrinogen, and 
platelets in the sample.
In these experiments, the shear modulus values were estimated by interrogating the blood 
sample every 4 seconds. Clot time, expressed in minutes, is estimated by determining the 
time at which the rate of change in stiffness exceeds a pre-defined threshold value. Clot 
stiffness is estimated by identifying the shear modulus value at a specific time point after 
clot time. This parameter is expressed in units of hecto-Pascals or hPa (i.e., 1hPa = 100Pa).
Validation and Comparative Studies
Experiments described here were performed using a plasma-based control material and 
whole blood samples (obtained in 3.2% sodium citrate) from healthy volunteers. 
Comparative studies were performed against the TEG 5000 and the Clauss fibrinogen assay 
implemented in the Stago STart4 Hemostasis analyzer. Detailed descriptions of blood 
collection, blood processing procedures, and comparative studies are described in the 
Supplemental Digital Material.
Results
Technology Reproducibility
Assay reproducibility was assessed with both whole blood samples and the plasma-based 
control materials over a period of 5 days. In the case of whole blood samples, a different 
volunteer was used for each day. A modified set of reagents was used in the cartridge as 
heparinase I and abciximab were not included, thus yielding two estimates of Clot Time and 
two estimates of Clot Stiffness for each run.
Reproducibility results are summarized in Table 3. When pooled over the 5 testing days, the 
plasma-based control material showed a Clot Time CV of 4.3% (n = 20, 99% CI [2.5% - 
6.1%]) and a Clot Stiffness CV of 8.5% (n = 20, 99% CI [4.9% - 12.1%]). Additional 
experiments with control material on 3 different Quantra analyzers over 5 days yielded an 
average Clot Time CV of 4.1% (n = 60, 99% CI [3.2% - 5.1%]) and an average Clot 
Stiffness CV of 8.3% (n = 60, 99% CI [6.4% - 10.4%]).
Assessment of Coagulation Function
The effects of the coagulation factors on Clot Time were investigated by titrating varying 
amounts of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) with samples from healthy volunteers to 
achieve final concentrations of 0, 1, 2, and 4 IU/ml. All the cartridge channels were loaded 
with channel 1 reagents (see Table 1), hence activating the sample with kaolin. The results 
presented in the dose response curve in Figure 4 demonstrate that increasing amounts of 
LMWH delayed the formation of the fibrin as indicated by a prolonged Clot Time21.
Additional experiments were performed using samples that were untreated, spiked with a 
low dose of unfractionated heparin, or where the endogenous plasma was replaced with 
Factor VIII, X, or XII deficient plasmas. The same experimental conditions (same sample 
and reagents) were assessed in parallel using the TEG, resulting in multiple paired 
measurements. The results are summarized in Figure 5, which demonstrates that Quantra

 Clot Time and TEG's R values are well correlated over the range of conditions analyzed (r-
value of 0.95, n = 34, 99% CI [0.88 – 0.98]).
Assessment of Platelet Contribution to Clot Stiffness
The effects of platelet function on SEER Sonorheometry measurements are shown in Figure 
6 (top panel), where samples from healthy volunteers were treated with increasing amounts 
of abciximab, a potent GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist22,23. All the cartridge channels were 
loaded with channel 3 reagents (see Table 1), hence activating the sample with 
thromboplastin. In this figure, Clot Stiffness decreases monotonically as a function of 
abciximab concentration converging towards a plateau at around 6 μg/ml. Above this 
concentration, the measured stiffness is indicative of the fibrin network alone with little to 
no contribution from platelets. This figure also shows that Clot Stiffness decreased by 
roughly 7 fold over the range reported in this figure, emphasizing the role of platelets in 
determining the final mechanical stiffness of the mature clot.
Experiments were performed in parallel with the TEG using the same blood samples dosed 
with abciximab. The results are summarized in Figure 6 (bottom panel), which depicts 
average Clot Stiffness values estimated by SEER Sonorheometry versus the average TEG's 
G parameter. As shown in this figure, the two measurements exhibit a linear relationship 
over the broad range of clot stiffness values analyzed.
Assessment of Fibrinogen Contribution to Clot Stiffness
Figure 7 shows the effects of fibrinogen content on SEER Sonorheometry measurements of 
Fibrinogen Contribution. All the cartridge channels were loaded with channel 4 reagents 
(see Table 1), hence activating the sample with the combination of thromboplastin and a 
saturating dose of abciximab to remove the platelet's ability to modulate clot stiffness. For 
each of the five subjects enrolled, the target fibrinogen concentration was in the range of 75 
mg/dl to 286 mg/dl, spanning the pathologically low to normal range.
The data shown in the upper panel of Figure 7 indicates that, for each subject, Fibrinogen 
Contribution varied linearly over the range of 75-286 mg/dl. The lower panel of Figure 7 
shows the pooled Quantra data compared with plasma fibrinogen measured with the STart4. 
The correlation of 0.94 (n = 29, 99% CI [0.87 – 0.98]) observed between the two 
technologies is high, demonstrating the ability of SEER Sonorheometry to measure low 
fibrinogen concentrations.
Discussion
In this work, we introduced and characterized the Quantra Hemostasis Analyzer, a novel 
platform for the viscoelastic assessment of whole blood coagulation, and evaluated its 
reproducibility and ability to assess the function of key hemostatic components. The Quantra 
has been designed and optimized for ease of use, complete system automation, and rapid 
turnaround time in order to enable utilization at the point of care or near patient. The SEER 
Sonorheometry technology utilized in the Quantra is a patented method that does not require 
moving mechanical components to be in direct contact with the blood sample being 
measured. SEER Sonorheometry measures changes in shear modulus of the sample during

 coagulation to estimate the onset of clot formation and the clot stiffness generated by the 
combination of fibrin network and activated platelets.
The data presented suggests that SEER Sonorheometry can perform precise measurements 
for both the determination of clot time and clot stiffness in whole blood with CVs in the 
range of 2.4% – 8.8%. Figures 4 and 5 show Clot Time measurements over varying 
anticoagulant concentrations and coagulation factor deficiencies. The data presented in 
Figures 6 and 7 show the effects of varying levels of functional platelets and fibrinogen 
content to clot stiffness. These experiments revealed that the shear modulus measured in 
whole blood is roughly 7 times greater than the contribution provided by fibrinogen alone. 
We hypothesize that this wide dynamic range stems from the fact that SEER Sonorheometry 
is non-contact and applies low shear strains, allowing for the measurement of very soft clots 
that are often associated with clinical bleeding. The data also demonstrate that, under the 
conditions tested here, the Quantra exhibited good correlation with other well-established 
devices such as the TEG and the Clauss assay performed on the STart4 (Figures 5-7).
In conclusion, these studies indicate that SEER Sonorheometry combined with the Quantra 
Surgical Cartridge can provide a rapid and precise measures of Clot Time, Clot Stiffness, 
Platelet and Fibrinogen Contributions to clot stiffness, and the presence of heparin 
anticoagulation. Each of these test results could be used, together with other clinical 
information, to provide comprehensive information and guide treatments intended to restore 
balanced hemostasis. Additional studies are warranted to demonstrate the clinical utility of 
the Quantra and the Surgical Cartridge. We hypothesize that the comprehensive information 
that the device is capable of providing could have numerous potential clinical applications 
besides the surgical settings, such as in the case of advanced liver disease, cancer, and 
trauma.

Schematic representation of SEER Sonorheometry. The technology is composed of three 
fundamental steps, as represented by the three panels in this figure. First, an ultrasound pulse 
is transmitted in the blood sample to generate a shear wave, causing the sample to resonate 
(left panel). A series of ultrasound “tracking” pulses is then sent within the sample and the 
returning echoes are used to estimate the sample motion (middle panel). The shape of the 
estimated displacement curve is directly related to the shear modulus of the sample. The 
time-displacement curve can be compared to theoretical models to determine the actual 
shear modulus for that specific point in time. This process is repeated every 4 seconds to 
form a signature curve that shows shear modulus vs time (right panel).
