Abstract Antibiotic use is a primary driver of antibiotic resistance. However, antibiotic use can
be distributed in different ways in a population, and the association between the distribution of use
and antibiotic resistance has not been explored. Here, we tested the hypothesis that repeated use
of antibiotics has a stronger association with population-wide antibiotic resistance than broadly-
distributed, low-intensity use. First, we characterized the distribution of outpatient antibiotic use
across US states, finding that antibiotic use is uneven and that repeated use of antibiotics makes
up a minority of antibiotic use. Second, we compared antibiotic use with resistance for 72
pathogen-antibiotic combinations across states. Finally, having partitioned total use into extensive
and intensive margins, we found that intense use had a weaker association with resistance than
extensive use. If the use-resistance relationship is causal, these results suggest that reducing total
use and selection intensity will require reducing broadly distributed, low-intensity use.

Introduction
Antibiotic use is a primary driver of antibiotic resistance, and reducing antibiotic use is a central
strategy for combatting resistance (Gould, 1999; Harbarth and Samore, 2005). Understanding the
relationship between antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance is therefore critical for the design of
rational antibiotic stewardship strategies. Multiple studies have identified cross-sectional relation-
ships between antibiotic use and resistance, especially across European countries and US states
(Goossens et al., 2005; Garcı
´a-Rey et al., 2002; Bronzwaer et al., 2002; Bell et al., 2014;
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control et al., 2017; van de Sande-Bruinsma et al.,
2008; MacFadden et al., 2018a). In general, these studies compare total outpatient antibiotic use
with population-level resistance. However, antibiotic use is generally not evenly distributed. A study
of outpatient prescribing in the UK found that 30% of patients were prescribed at least one antibi-
otic per year, with the top 9% of patients receiving 53% of all antibiotics (Shallcross et al., 2017). A

 study of beneficiaries of Medicare, a national health insurance program that covers that vast majority
of Americans 65 and older, found that the proportion of beneficiaries who take antibiotics varies by
US state and drug class (Zhang et al., 2012). In some cases, antibiotic courses can last for months or
even years (Enzler et al., 2011; Lau et al., 2017). Because antibiotic use is uneven, total use does
not distinguish between broad use—many people receiving a few prescriptions—and intense use—a
few people receiving many prescriptions (Berrington, 2010).
It stands to reason that the distribution of antibiotic use, not just total use, could have an effect
on resistance (Turnidge and Christiansen, 2005). There are few studies of the relationship between
repeated antibiotic exposure on antibiotic resistance (Costelloe et al., 2010; Hillier et al., 2007;
Carothers et al., 2007; Arason et al., 1996; Nasrin et al., 2002; McMahon et al., 2003;
Catry et al., 2018), and it remains unclear whether broad use or intense use is associated with popu-
lation-level resistance. For example, if a first course of antibiotics given to an antibiotic-naive patient
clears most of the susceptible bacteria they carry, then a second course in the same patient will have
only a small effect, since most susceptible bacteria were already eliminated. Giving that second
course to a different, antibiotic-naive patient instead would have a greater effect on population-level
resistance. On the other hand, multiple courses given to a single patient might have a synergistic
effect on resistance.
The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that intense antibiotic use has a stronger associa-
tion with population-level resistance than broad, low-level antibiotic use. We used an ecological
design to compare the distribution of antibiotic use with antibiotic resistance. Although an ecologi-
cal design is potentially subject to confounders and cannot definitively test for the causal effect of
the distribution of use on resistance at the individual level, ecological studies of use and resistance
are the most feasible design for studying the relationship between antibiotic use and population-
level resistance, and the results of ecological designs play an important role in developing antibiotic
stewardship policies (Huttner and Samore, 2011; Schechner et al., 2013).
To test this hypothesis, we first characterized the distribution of outpatient antibiotic use in two
US nationwide pharmacy prescription claims databases, Truven Health MarketScan Research Data-
base (Truven Health Analytics, 2015) and Medicare, both covering 2011–2014. We considered only
outpatient antibiotic prescribing, which accounts for 80–90% of total medical antibiotic use in the
UK and Sweden (Public Health Agency of Sweden and National Veterinary Institute, 2015;
ESPAUR Writing Committee, 2014) and is presumed to account for a similar fraction in the US
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017). Unlike antibiotic sales data and nationwide
healthcare surveys (Hicks et al., 2015), MarketScan and Medicare claims data, which have previously
been used to characterize variations in antibiotic use (Zhang et al., 2012; Suskind et al., 2016;
Owusu-Edusei et al., 2015; Arizpe et al., 2016), provide longitudinal prescribing information about
individual people, and can therefore distinguish between many people getting a few prescriptions
and a few people getting many prescriptions. We characterized the distribution of antibiotic use
across US states by partitioning annual total use as the sum of annual first use—individuals’ first
pharmacy fill for an antibiotic in a calendar year—and annual repeat use—pharmacy fills beyond indi-
viduals’ first ones in a calendar year. Second, we compared annual total antibiotic use with antibiotic
resistance as measured in ResistanceOpen, a US nationwide sample of antibiotic susceptibility
reports,
for
2012–2015
(i.e.

et

Bruyndonckx et al., 2015)), evaluating the relationship between use and resistance across US states
for 72 pathogen-antibiotic combinations. Finally, we evaluated whether annual first use and annual
repeat use are differently associated with population-level resistance.
Results
Antibiotic use is not evenly distributed
Our analysis included 99.8 million outpatient pharmacy antibiotic prescription fills among 62.4 mil-
lion unique people, approximately 20% of the US population, during 2011–2014 using the Market-
Scan database (Truven Health Analytics, 2015). In 2011, 34% of people received an antibiotic, and
10% of people received 57% of all antibiotic prescriptions. This distribution varied by population but
was similar across data years (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). To characterize the distribution of
specific antibiotics, we grouped individual antibiotic generic formulations into drug groups based on

 their chemical structures and mechanisms of action (Supplementary file 1 - Table 1). For all drug
groups, most people had zero prescriptions for that antibiotic in a given year, but antibiotics differed
in their distributions (Figure 1).
We next examined the distribution of antibiotic use for each drug group and US state. To quan-
tify the distribution of antibiotic use, we labeled each antibiotic pharmacy claim as ‘first’ if it was the
first pharmacy fill for that drug group made by that individual in that calendar year, and ‘repeat’ if it
was a second, third, etc. fill for an antibiotic in the same drug group made by the same individual in
the same calendar year. An individual’s first and repeat claims in a calendar year add up to their total
number of claims for that year. We then partitioned population-level annual total use, measured as
pharmacy fills per 1000 members per year, into the sum of annual first use, measured as first fills per
1000 members per year, and repeat use, measured as repeat fill per 1000 members per year, for
each drug group and US state. Annual first use of a drug group is equivalent to the proportion of
the population taking an antibiotic in that group in that year.
Total use varied between drug groups and across states (Figure 2). Annual repeat use made up a
steady one-quarter to one-third of annual total use across drugs and states, with the exception of
tetracyclines, for which high repeat use was associated with young adults (Figure 2—figure supple-
ments 1 and 2), probably for acne treatment. This distribution of first and repeat use is distinct from
the pattern predicted by the single-parameter Poisson and geometric distributions (Figure 2), but
the ratio of first use to repeat use for each drug was nearly constant across US Census regions (Fig-
ure 2—figure supplement 3). Thus, the higher antibiotic use in the Southern states (Zhang et al.,
2012; Hicks et al., 2013) is primarily attributable to a greater proportion of people taking antibiot-
ics, not because those who receive antibiotics receive more of them.

 Landscape of correlations between total use and resistance across
pathogens and antibiotics
To verify that our antibiotic use and resistance data sources could be used to distinguish the associa-
tions of first use and repeat use with antibiotic resistance, we first measured the landscape of Spear-
man correlations between total use and antibiotic resistance for multiple pathogens and antibiotics
(Goossens et al., 2005; Garcı
´a-Rey et al., 2002; Bronzwaer et al., 2002; Bell et al., 2014;
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control et al., 2017; van de Sande-Bruinsma et al.,
2008). To measure antibiotic resistance, we used ResistanceOpen, a US nationwide sample of hospi-
tal antibiotic susceptibility reports (MacFadden et al., 2016), which included resistance of 38 patho-
gens to 37 antibiotics in 641 antibiotic susceptibility reports from 230 organizations (hospitals,
laboratories, and surveillance units) spread over 44 US states. Although most organizations contrib-
uting antibiotic susceptibility reports were hospitals, hospital antibiotic susceptibility reports are
biased toward community-acquired organisms (Wang et al., 2017; Hindler and Stelling, 2007),
community antibiotic use can drive antibiotic resistance measured in hospitals (Knight et al., 2018;
MacFadden et al., 2018b), and studies often compare hospital antibiotic susceptibility reports with
community antibiotic use (Goossens et al., 2005; MacDougall et al., 2005; Hicks et al., 2011).
Because the epidemiology and pharmacology of each pathogen-antibiotic combination is unique,
each combination could have a unique use-resistance relationship (Turnidge and Christiansen,
2005). We therefore aggregated antibiotic resistance into the same drug groups with which we
aggregated antibiotic use (Supplementary file 1 – Table 1) and evaluated the 72 pathogen-

 antibiotic combinations that were adequately represented in the antibiotic resistance data (see
Materials and methods). Across those 72 combinations, correlation coefficients ranged from –32% to
64% (Figure 3, Supplementary file 1 - Table 2). The strongest correlation (Spearman’s � = 64%,
95% CI 41% to 80%) was between macrolide use and the proportion of Streptococcus pneumoniae
isolates that were macrolide nonsusceptible (Figure 4). Correlation coefficients were mostly positive
(median correlation coefficient 21%, IQR 8% to 34%). Use-resistance correlations involving macro-
lides, quinolones, and cephalosporins were more positive than those for nitrofurantoin, and correla-
tions involving quinolones were more positive than those for trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole
(pairwise Mann-Whitney tests, two-tailed, FDR = 0.05). Coefficients were not significantly more posi-
tive for any particular pathogen.
Because isolates from older adults are disproportionately represented in antibiotic susceptibility
reports (Kanjilal et al., 2018), we suspected that population-wide resistance might, in some cases,
correlate better with antibiotic use among older adults. We therefore queried outpatient pharmacy
antibiotic claims records from individuals 65 and older on Medicare (see Materials and methods).
When antibiotic use among Medicare beneficiaries was substituted for antibiotic use as measured in
the MarketScan data (Figure 2—figure supplement 2), correlation coefficients were similar
(Supplementary file 1 – Tables 2 and 3). Conversely, children are the primary carriers for some
pathogens (e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae (Garcı
´a-Rodrı
´guez and Fresnadillo Martı
´nez, 2002)),
so we suspected that resistance might, in other cases, better correlate with children’s antibiotic use.
Restricting the antibiotic use data to members at most 15 years old (Figure 2—figure supplement
2) again yielded similar coefficients (Supplementary file 1 - Tables 2 and 3). Thus, the landscape of
correlations we observed was mostly robust to the exact population in which antibiotic use was
measured.
We also evaluated the sensitivity of the results to the measurement of antibiotic use, substituting
days supply of antibiotic for number of pharmacy fills, and the geographic level of the analysis, by
aggregating the Medicare use data and resistance data at the level of the 306 hospital referral
regions that approximate regional health care markets (The Center for the Evaluative Clinical Sci-
ences, Dartmouth Medical School, 1996) (Supplementary file 1 – Tables 2 and 3). The absolute
values of the correlation coefficients were slightly closer to zero when using days supply rather than
fills (Wilcoxon test, two-tailed; pseudomedian difference in absolute correlation coefficient 1.9 per-
centage points, 95% CI 0.72 to 3.1) and substantially closer to zero when using hospital referral
regions rather than states as the units of analysis (6.1 percentage points, 95% CI 3.0 to 9.1).
We finally evaluated the sensitivity of the results to the exact antibiotic resistance data (Figure 3—
figure supplement 1, Supplementary file 1 – Tables 2 and 3). First, we excluded all antibiotic sus-
ceptibility reports whose annotations indicated they include isolates exclusively from inpatient set-
tings. Most reports include isolates from a mix of settings, so this analysis excluded only 7% of the
total number of isolates from the data. Second, we included only reports whose annotations indi-
cated their isolates were exclusively from outpatient or emergency room settings, which retained
only 14% of the isolates. Correlations using the resistance data excluding inpatient-only isolates
were slightly stronger than the baseline data (Wilcoxon test, two-tailed; pseudomedian difference in
absolute correlation coefficient 1.1 percentage points, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.2), but correlations com-
puted using the outpatient-only data were not systematically stronger or weaker.
Lack of evidence for more positive association with repeat use
Having examined the landscape of the relationships between total use and resistance across patho-
gen-antibiotic combinations, we set out to test the hypothesis that repeat use has a stronger associ-
ation with resistance than first use. For each pathogen-antibiotic combination, we performed a
multiple regression predicting proportion nonsusceptible from first use and repeat use (Figure 5).
First use and repeat use are highly correlated in some cases (Supplementary file 1 - Table 4) which
will widen the confidence intervals on the regression coefficients but should not introduce bias
(Schisterman et al., 2017). Regression coefficients for first use were more often positive than nega-
tive (54 of 72 [75%]; binomial test, 95% CI 63% to 84%). That is, first use was positively associated
with resistance when controlling for repeat use. In contrast, regression coefficients for repeat use
were more often negative than positive (44 of 72 [61%]; binomial test, 95% CI 49% to 72%). That is,
repeat use was negatively associated with resistance when controlling for first use.

 We evaluated the sensitivity of this result to age group, data source, metric of antibiotic use, geo-
graphic unit of analysis, and subset of the resistance data as described above. In all cases, regression
coefficients for first use in the multiple regression were more likely to be positive than negative, and
regression coefficients for repeat use were more likely to be negative than positive in all but one
case (Supplementary file 1 - Table 5). For certain pathogens and antibiotics, resistance could pre-
sumably accumulate in an individual over many years (Carothers et al., 2007; McMahon et al.,
2003), so we also computed alternate measures of first and repeat use by considering only individu-
als who were included in the MarketScan data for each year of 2011–2014, and we labeled an

 antibiotic fill as first use only if it was the first fill for that drug group made by that individual in the
entire 4-year period. In that analysis, a similar proportion of regression coefficients for first use were
positive (69%, 95% CI 57% to 80%) and regression coefficients for repeat use were equally likely to
be positive or negative (53%, 95% CI 41% to 65%).
Discussion
Landscape of use-resistance relationships
We used US nationwide datasets measuring antibiotic use in 60 million individuals and antibiotic
resistance in 3 million bacterial isolates to analyze relationships between antibiotic use and resis-
tance, examining 72 pathogen-antibiotic combinations simultaneously, using identical data sources
and analytical methods across combinations. Although previous studies have examined multiple
pathogen-antibiotic combinations, usually no more than five pathogens or antibiotics are considered
at once (Goossens et al., 2005; Garcı
´a-Rey et al., 2002; van de Sande-Bruinsma et al., 2008). We
found that correlations between total use and resistance were mostly positive and that certain drugs
tended to have more positive correlations, but that there was no clear pattern by organism
(Bell et al., 2014). The overall landscape of correlations was mostly robust to the age groups stud-
ied, the subset of resistance data used, and the geographic scale of the analysis, although correla-
tions were somewhat weaker when conducting analysis at smaller geographic scales (van de Sande-
Bruinsma et al., 2008; Priest et al., 2001; Magee et al., 1999; Livermore et al., 2000). We used
outpatient antibiotic use as the predictor of resistance because 80–90% of antibiotic use occurs in
the outpatient setting (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017) and because most anti-
biotic pressure on pathogens is due to ‘bystander selection’, in which the patient is treated for some
reason other than an infection caused by that pathogen (Tedijanto et al., 2018).
The correlations we observed between total antibiotic use and population-wide antibiotic resis-
tance were noticeably weaker than those in highly cited European studies but comparable to those
from other analyses of European data. For example, for S. pneumoniae and macrolides,
Goossens et al. (2005) reported a Spearman’s � of 83% and Garcı
´a-Rey et al. (2002) reported
85%, while we found 62% and van de Sande-Bruinsma et al. (2008) reported a median of 56%.
These studies all used similar statistical methods, so the differences in the results must be due to
some other factors (e.g. data quality, range of antibiotic use, distribution of antibiotic use, or patho-
gen biology). Correlations between E. coli resistance and use of b-lactams, cephalosporins, trimetho-
prim/sulfamethoxazole, and quinolones were similar to those reported in studies of use and
resistance in UK primary care groups (Priest et al., 2001; Magee et al., 1999).
The most notable difference, however, between our study and previous results from Europe is for
S. pneumoniae and b-lactams: Goossens et al. (2005) report a Spearman’s � of 84%, but we found
no relation (–11%, 95% CI –41% to 22%). We propose that the narrow variation in b-lactam use
across US states, approximately two-fold between the highest- and lowest-using states, obscures a
correlation that is more apparent in Europe, where there is a four-fold variation between the highest-
and lowest-using countries (Goossens et al., 2005). Thus, our results and those from Goossens et al.
may be consistent with respect to the underlying biology. We also note that, when reproducing the
methodology from a US study (Hicks et al., 2011) of the use-resistance relationship for b-lactams
and S. pneumoniae (dichotomizing states as high- or low-prescribing and computing the odds ratio
of resistance), we find a consistent point estimate but with wider confidence intervals (1.15, 95% CI
0.75 to 1.76).
Our study design may limit the interpretability of the landscape of use-resistance relationships.
First, like the leading European studies using EARS-Net and US studies using the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention Active Bacterial Core surveillance, we compare population-wide outpatient
antibiotic use with antibiotic susceptibility reports from hospitals. The degree to which hospital anti-
biotic susceptibility reports represent community infections is debated (Wang et al., 2017;
MacDougall et al., 2005). For example, if outpatient antibiotic use selects for resistance among
community-acquired infections, and hospital antibiograms reflect data from community-acquired
infections as well as unrelated inpatient resistance patterns, then the correlations we measure would
be biased toward weaker associations. Furthermore, antibiotic use and resistance in the community

 setting is not completely independent of use and resistance in the hospital setting (Knight et al.,
2018), and our approach does not account for any relationship between the two.
Second, antibiotic resistance is temporally dynamic, and our cross-sectional approach assumes
that antibiotic use is autocorrelated across years (Lipsitch, 2001) or that resistance changes slowly
(Hennessy et al., 2002). If use does cause resistance, and use and resistance changed meaningfully
over the course of the study, then the correlations we measured by aggregating over all years would
be biased toward weaker associations.
Third, because of the limitations in statistical power, we did not address the possibility that use of
one antibiotic can select for resistance to another antibiotic (Pouwels et al., 2018; Weber et al.,
2003). Notably, use of one antibiotic can select for resistance to another antibiotic if the dominant
clones of that species are resistant to both (Pouwels et al., 2018). In that case, if the use rates of
the two drugs are correlated across states, then the apparent relationship between one drug and
resistance to that drug would be biased upward. Furthermore, because the palette of antibiotic use
varies by country (Van Boeckel et al., 2014), and different pathogen strains circulate in different
populations, the univariate associations we observed between use of an antibiotic and resistance to
that antibiotic in the US may not be applicable in other geographies.
Finally, like in other studies of antibiotic use, we did not address patient adherence, and typical
approaches to address adherence using claims data (Steiner and Prochazka, 1997) are problematic
when the intended duration of treatment is not clear. The measured correlation would then be
biased if, for example, poor patient adherence increased resistance and patient adherence were
also correlated with antibiotic use.
Distribution of antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance
We described the distribution of antibiotic use across drug groups and US states, finding that 34%
of the study population took an antibiotic in a year, and 10% of the population had 57% of the anti-
biotic fills in that year, similar to results from the UK (Shallcross et al., 2017), although this distribu-
tion varied by population (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). By partitioning annual total use into
annual first use and annual repeat use, we were able to show that, for each drug, annual first use
makes up the majority of annual total use and that variations in annual first use explain more variance
in annual total use than do variations in annual repeat use. We also found that first use tends to have
a positive association with resistance when controlling for repeat use, while repeat use tends to have
negative associations with resistance when controlling for first use. This result held across sensitivity
analyses.
If these associations are causal, that is, if outpatient first and repeat antibiotic use select for resis-
tance among community-acquired pathogens, then our results would imply that antibiotic resistance
in the outpatient setting is due more to first use, which tended to have positive associations with
resistance, than to repeat use. In contrast to proposals to focus on intense antibiotic users for com-
batting resistance (Shallcross et al., 2017), this situation would imply that preventing marginal pre-
scriptions among patients whose indications are borderline-appropriate or inappropriate for
antibiotics may be the more effective tactic for reducing the prevalence of resistance mechanisms
already established in the US.
There are limitations to the interpretability of these results. First, as mentioned above, there is a
potential mismatch between the sources of the antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance data.
Second, although antibiotic use is a major driver of antibiotic resistance, the observed results may
not be causal. Factors beyond antibiotic use, like population density, play a role in antibiotic resis-
tance (Harbarth and Samore, 2005; MacFadden et al., 2018a). Even if antibiotic use and resistance
are causally related, it may be that resistance affects antibiotic use. For example, if resistance to a
drug is high, treatment using that drug is more likely to fail, discouraging repeated use, so that high
resistance lead to decreased repeat use (Wang et al., 2017; Priest et al., 2001; Pouwels et al.,
2018). Ecological studies like this one do not directly address causality, and further work is needed
to distinguish between different causal pathways.
Third, the observed population-level relationships between antibiotic use and resistance need not
also hold for the relationship between an individual’s first and repeat antibiotic use and the risk of a
resistant infection in that individual. Any comparisons between our population-level results and indi-
vidual-level studies would need to account for the difference between our population-level measures

 of first and repeat antibiotic use and the individual-level timing of antibiotic use and measurements
of resistance.
Fourth, controlling for factors beyond antibiotic use could alter the apparent relationship
between antibiotic use and resistance. In particular, we speculate that controlling for patient morbid-
ity, which we did not address in this population-level analysis, would amplify the observed result,
that first use tends to have a more positive association with antibiotic resistance than repeat use. We
expect that morbid individuals have more repeat antibiotic use. We also expect that morbid individ-
uals visit the hospital more often, putting them at higher risk of antibiotic resistant infections regard-
less of their antibiotic use. Thus, we speculate that repeat use causes resistance and also is a
predictor of morbidity, which is associated with resistance. Failing to control for morbidity thus
biases the association between repeat use and resistance toward more positive values. Conversely,
controlling for morbidity would decrease the measured relationships between repeat use and resis-
tance, amplifying our central result.
Fifth, we defined first and repeat use with respect to the calendar year, while it may be that some
other timescale is the appropriate one for this analysis. Although our central result held when re-
defining first and repeat use with respect to a 4-year period (Supplementary file 1 - Table 5), it may
be that, say, repeat use within an individual on a time-scale shorter than a year is an important deter-
minant for risk of resistance in that individual. Our study does not distinguish between repeat use
that occurs across calendar year boundaries, which is presumably important for relating individuals’
antibiotic use with their risk of resistance.
Finally, we note that first use and repeat use are only one set of many ways of measuring the dis-
tribution of antibiotic use. For example, 10 repeat uses could mean 1 person with 10 repeat uses or
10 people with 1 repeat use each. The first and repeat use metrics cannot distinguish between these
two cases, and it may be that some other measure of the distribution of antibiotic use would yield
different results.
In conclusion, we find that population-wide antibiotic use and population-wide resistance appears
to be more closely linked with broadly distributed, low-intensity use rather than with intensity of use.
Ultimately, accurate models predicting the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance will
require more careful characterizations of who gets what antibiotic (Harbarth et al., 2001), what
selection pressure that places on pathogens, how those pathogens are transmitted, and in whom
they manifest as infections (Lipsitch and Samore, 2002). An ideal study would compare the com-
plete history of an individual’s outpatient and inpatient antibiotic exposure with clinical microbiology
data from that same individual, cross-referenced against population-level factors, among a represen-
tative, nationwide sample of individuals. Individual-level results could then also be compared with
mechanistic models of resistance to draw inferences about within-host effects of antibiotic use
(Levin et al., 1997; Colijn et al., 2010), and the role of co-occurring resistance and correlated antibi-
otic use could be addressed. In the absence of such a dataset, these ecological, associative results
provide a guide to the development of antibiotic stewardship policy.
Materials and methods
Study population and antibiotic use
MarketScan (Truven Health Analytics, 2015) data covering 2011–2014 were used to identify insur-
ance plan members and characterize their outpatient antibiotic use. To ensure quality of the antibi-
otic use distribution data, only members who were on their insurance plan for 12 months during a
given calendar year were included. Prescription fills for oral and injected antibiotics were identified
by generic formulation (Supplementary file 1 - Table 6) and drug forms (Supplementary file 1 -
Table 7). We treated multiple claims on the same day for the same generic formulation with the
same refill code as a single prescription fill. In the main analysis, antibiotic use was measured using
fills, rather than days supply of drug, because some previous research has suggested that prescrip-
tions better correlate with resistance (Bruyndonckx et al., 2015) and that this choice is probably not
detrimental (van de Sande-Bruinsma et al., 2008; Lipsitch, 2001). Generic drugs were grouped
into antibiotic drug groups designed to correspond to the antibiotic resistance drug groups
described below (Supplementary file 1 - Table 1). All measures of antibiotic use were computed for

analyses of the use-resistance relationship.

ries for each year 2011 to 2014. The Medicare data, which provides the ZIP Code for each benefi-
ciary, were also aggregated at the level of hospital referral region (The Center for the Evaluative
Clinical Sciences, Dartmouth Medical School, 1996), using the 2011 ZIP Code to region crosswalk.
MarketScan data do not include ZIP Code-level resolution.
This study was deemed exempt from review by the institutional review board at the Harvard T. H.
Chan School of Public Health.
Antibiotic resistance
Antibiotic resistance prevalences for common bacterial pathogens were identified from Resistan-
ceOpen, a previously developed database of spatially localized patterns of antibiotic resistance
(MacFadden et al., 2016). This continuously updated database contains antibiotic resistance data
from online sources during 2012 to 2015. At the time of analysis, the resistance data consisted of
approximately 86,000 records, each indicating the fraction of isolates of an organism that were non-
susceptible to a particular drug in a particular antibiotic susceptibility report (‘antibiogram’). The
median number of isolates corresponding to each record was 93, but records had up to 75,000 asso-
ciated isolates. Seven records (<0.01%) with missing numbers of isolates were excluded. In antibio-
grams that separated S. aureus into MRSA and MSSA, resistance of aggregate S. aureus to
individual drugs was taken as the average of the MRSA and MSSA records, weighted by number of
isolates. MRSA and MSSA were not considered as separate species in any analysis.
Antibiotics used in antibiotic resistance assays were grouped into antibiotic drug groups
(Supplementary file 1 - Table 1) designed to correspond to the antibiotic use groups. If resistance
to more than one antibiotic in a drug group was reported for a particular pathogen in a particular
antibiogram, resistance to that drug group for that pathogen in that antibiogram was computed as
the mean of the resistances measured for the antibiotics in that group, weighted by the number of
isolates. The proportion of nonsusceptible isolates in a state for a particular pathogen-antibiotic
combination was computed as the average of the proportions from each contributing antibiogram in
that state, weighted by number of isolates.
Statistical methods
Antibiotic use and resistance were compared using Spearman correlations and multiple linear regres-
sions. Of the 887 pathogen-antibiotic combinations present in the data, we analyzed the 72 combi-
nations that were present in at least 34 states. This excluded 21% of the pathogen-antibiotic-
antibiogram combinations. We established the cut-off for number of states because 80% power to
detect a Pearson correlation coefficient of magnitude 0.55 at a = 0.01 under a two-sided hypothesis
requires at least 34 samples. There is no straightforward power calculation methodology for Spear-
man correlations, so we used the Pearson power calculation as an approximation. We aggregated
data across all years, rather than comparing use and resistance in each year, because of the sparsity
of the resistance data: of 2767 pathogen-antibiotic-state combinations in the data, only 182 have
data for all 4 years. No pathogen-antibiotic combination had more than 4 states with data for all 4
years. Confidence intervals on correlation coefficients were computed using the Fisher transforma-
tion and normal approximation method. Multiple comparisons were accounted for using the Benja-
mini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). Multiple regressions
predicted proportion of isolates nonsusceptible from first use and repeat use.
