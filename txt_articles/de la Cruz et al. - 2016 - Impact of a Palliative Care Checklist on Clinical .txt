Abstract
Purpose
Checklistsareusedinmanydifferentsettingsforthepurposeofstandardizationandreduction
of preventable errors in practice. Our group sought to determine whether a palliative care
checklist (PCC) would improve the clinical documentation of key patient information.
Methods
An initial review of 110 randomly selected medical records dictated by 10 physicians was
performed. The authors identified portions of the dictated medical records that were
included regularly, as well as those that were frequently missed. A PCC was drafted after
final approval was obtained from the 13 faculty members. Dictations from 13 clinical
faculties in the supportive care center were reviewed. A x2 test or Fisher’s exact test was
applied to assess the difference in overall checked rates before and after checklist use. A
paired t test was used to examine the difference in the average complete rate and checked
rates before and after checklist use.
Results
There were improvements in the documentation before and after the checklist for scores
on the Cut-down, Annoyed, Guilty, Eye-opener questionnaire for alcoholism (79% v 94%;
P # .0001), psychosocial history (69% v 95%; P # .0001), Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status (38% v 81%; P # .0001), advance care planning (28% v 41%; P =
.0008), and overall (78% v 95%; P # .0001). There was no significant improvement in the
documentation for opioid-induced neurotoxicity (37% v 37%; P = .9492) or the Edmonton
Symptom Assessment Scale (98% v 99%; P = .4511).
Conclusion
Our study showed that the use of a PCC improved the quality of the documentation of a
patient visit in an outpatient clinical setting.
INTRODUCTION
Checklists are used in many different set-
tings for the purposes of standardization
and reduction of preventable errors in
practice.1-5 The general intent of such
checklists is to improve memory recall,
standardization, and adherence to ascribed
best practices, and to reduce errors. A
checklist
allows
easy
communication
among people involved in systems where it
is in use. In medical systems that have
implemented the checklist, improvements
in patient outcomes, patient safety, and
efficacyofresourceusewereobserved.1,3,5,6
Palliative care (PC) in our cancer center
is growing, both in the inpatient and out-
patient setting. The outpatient clinic has an
average of 600 patient encounters per
month. The practice of PC encompasses
multiple domains that include medical and

Quality in Action
 physical symptoms and functional, psychosocial, and spiritual
aspects. Discussions about end-of-life and advanced care
planning (ACP) are incorporated into routine care. Such dis-
cussions,whichinfluencepertinentmedicaldecisions,canoccur
at differenttime pointsin the patient–PC team interaction. The
patients seen in the PC clinic are often frail and have higher
levels of distress than do those seen in other clinics; access to
clinicalcareisthereforeprioritizedand,asaresult,patientsmay
see another PC physician. Internal audits detected variations in
the documentation that required standardization. Such varia-
tions can pose a problem with optimal delivery of care. Several
aspects of the patient’s care need to be addressed in a limited
number of visits to the outpatient center. An efficient system of
clinical documentationis thereforeimperative. A palliativecare
checklist (PCC) was designed in an effort to improve patient
care by standardizing the way physicians document a patient’s
medical encounters. The PCC incorporates dictation of critical
information that is essential for a high-quality PC encounter.
Our group sought to determine the impact of a PCC on the
clinical documentation of key patient information.
METHODS
This study was reviewed and approved by the institutional
reviewboardoftheMDAndersonCancerCenter.Followingthe
frameworkofdefine,measure,analyze,improve,andcontrol,we
identified the problem, measured and analyzed the steps in the
dictation process, identified potential areas of breakdown,
developedandimplementedaPCCtoimprovedocumentation,
andthenmeasuredsuccessandtheareasinwhichimprovement
was needed. After the lack of a standardized clinical doc-
umentation system was determined, 110 randomly selected
medical records dictated by 10 physicians were reviewed. The
authorsidentifiedthoseportionsofthedictatedmedicalrecords
that were included regularly and those that were frequently
missed and presented their findings to the entire faculty. A
consensus was reached on items to be included in the PCC and
implementation was supported by all faculty.
The key components of the PCC were ACP, the Cut-down,
Annoyed, Guilty, Eye-opener (CAGE) questionnaire for
alcoholism,7 the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale,8
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance status
(ECOG PS), the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale
(ESAS),9 assessment of constipation, screening for opioid-
induced neurotoxicity (OIN), psychosocial history and
counseling, physical examination, and integrative measures
for symptom management. The PCC was disseminated and
posted in clinical areas in the PC outpatient clinic. To
encourage PCC adoption, e-mail reminders were sent to all
physicians,PCandrotatingfellowswereeducatedonPCCuse,
and random checks were performed by the authors.
Six months after implementation, dictations from 13
clinical faculties in the PC outpatient clinic were reviewed.
Randomdictations3monthsbeforetheimplementationofthe
checklist and 3 months after implementation were compared.
Improvement in documentation is not considered to be a
changein the practiceof deliveryof care because all physicians
followed the same practice patterns.
Successful overall documentation was recorded when
physicians dictated six of 10 items correctly. For OIN and
constipation, the documentation was considered to be correct
if it contained at least one of the following: hallucinations,
myoclonus, or confusion for OIN, and stool frequency,
character, or last bowel movement for constipation. For
narrative items such as ACP and integrative and psychosocial
history, the consensus was to consider the item to be docu-
mented appropriately whether the physician stated any
findings of any nature or purposely deferred. Physical
examination was reported to be complete if the physician
dictated at least six out of 10 systems.

Palliative Care Checklist
 improvement in the quality of medical care has been
observed.1,3,5,10 Our group developed a process analysis for
clinical documentation. Appendix Fig A1 (online only) shows
that various areas in which information may be missed and
therefore not placed in the medical record can occur at dif-
ferent points in the clinic encounter. Problems may occur in
theacquisitionofinformationbythenursesandthephysician.
However, the use of assessment tools and a clinical packet
minimizes this problem. The incidence of delirium and
cognitive impairment in patients is minimal and with both the
nurses and physician taking the patient’s clinical history,
patient reporting as a source of missed information is small.
Face-to-facecommunicationisconductedforeverypatientby
the nurse and physician, allowing information to be passed on
adequately. On the basis of these findings, the problem seems
to be in the process of dictation. The use of a PCC promotes
completeness of the medical record, which in theory can
improve medical care, efficiency, and communication among
membersoftheinterdisciplinaryteamandcanreducethetime
spent in review of patient information.
Structured documentations that physicians follow gen-
erally increased timeliness and completeness.3,10,11 The key
areas of improvement were in the documentation of ECOG
PS, CAGE questionnaire, and psychosocial history and in the
overall documentation. There was no significant improve-
ment in ESAS documentation, which is attributed to suc-
cessful documentation before the implementation of the
checklistleavinglittleroomforimprovement.Documentation
of performance status is integral in PC because it is a useful
prognostication tool. The use of the CAGE questionnaire
assists in screening for potential negative coping in our
patients and is critical in our practice. Discussion of psy-
chosocial issues is a component of PC that is not typically
covered in a single patient visit. Complete documentation is
useful for the next physician on subsequent visits, allowing for
better flow and effective use of limited clinical time.
Documentation in the area of ACP did not show any
significant improvement. Failure to document resulted in lost
time and opportunity to focus on other vital aspects of care.
Repetitionofinformationcancausedistressandfrustrationon
the part of patients and their families. Documentation on the
discussion of integrative approaches and OIN showed no
improvement after checklist implementation. The breakdown
in translation of this information into the actual dictation that
getsrecordedinthemedicalrecordmaybecausedbyanumber
of factors, such as time constraints, physician habits, difficulty
adjustingtoanewstandardizedformat,andperhapsforgetting
to use the PCC altogether.
