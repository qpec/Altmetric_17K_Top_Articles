 Effect of Oral Insulin on Prevention of Diabetes
in Relatives of Patients With Type 1 Diabetes
A Randomized Clinical Trial
Writing Committee for the Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet Oral Insulin Study Group
IMPORTANCE Type 1 diabetes requires major lifestyle changes and carries increased morbidity
and mortality. Prevention or delay of diabetes would have major clinical effect.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether oral insulin delays onset of type 1 diabetes in
autoantibody-positive relatives of patients with type 1 diabetes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Between March 2, 2007, and December 21, 2015,
relatives with at least 2 autoantibodies, including insulin autoantibodies and normal glucose
tolerance, were enrolled in Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, the United
Kingdom, Italy, Sweden, Finland, and Germany. The main study group (n = 389) had first-phase
insulin release on an intravenous glucose tolerance test that was higher than the threshold.
The 55 patients in the secondary stratum 1 had an identical antibody profile as the main study
group except they had first-phase insulin release that was lower than the threshold. Secondary
strata 2 (n = 114) and strata 3 (n = 3) had different autoantibody profiles and first-phase insulin
release threshold combinations. Follow-up continued through December 31, 2016.
INTERVENTIONS Randomization to receive 7.5 mg/d of oral insulin (n = 283) or placebo
(n = 277), including participants in the main study group who received oral insulin (n = 203)
or placebo (n = 186).
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES The primary outcome was time to diabetes in the main study
group. Significance was based on a 1-sided threshold of .05, and 1-sided 95% CIs are reported.
RESULTS Of a total of 560 randomized participants (median enrollment age, 8.2 years;
interquartile range [IQR], 5.7-12.1 years; 170 boys [60%]; 90.7% white non-Hispanic; 57.6%
with a sibling with type 1 diabetes), 550 completed the trial including 389 participants (median
age, 8.4 years; 245 boys [63%]), 382 (96%) in the main study group. During a median
follow-up of 2.7 years (IQR, 1.5-4.6 years) in the main study group, diabetes was diagnosed in
58 participants (28.5%) in the oral insulin group and 62 (33%) in the placebo group. Time to
diabetes was not significantly different between the 2 groups (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87; 95% CI,
0-1.2; P = .21). In secondary stratum 1 (n = 55), diabetes was diagnosed in 13 participants
(48.1%) in the oral insulin group and in 19 participants (70.3%) in the placebo group. The time
to diabetes was significantly longer with oral insulin (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0-0.82; P = .006).
The HR for time to diabetes for the between-group comparisons for the 116 participants in the
other secondary stratum was 1.03 (95% CI, 0-2.11; P = .53) and for the entire cohort of 560
participants was 0.83 (95% CI, 0-1.07; P = .11), which were not significantly different. The most
common adverse event was infection (n = 254), with 134 events in the oral insulin group and
120 events in the placebo group, but no significant study-related adverse events occurred.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among autoantibody-positive relatives of patients with type 1
diabetes, oral insulin at a dose of 7.5 mg/d, compared with placebo, did not delay or prevent
the development of type 1 diabetes over 2.7 years. These findings do not support oral insulin
as used in this study for diabetes prevention.

 I
n the Diabetes Prevention Trial–Type 1 (DPT-1),1,2 oral
insulin compared with placebo did not show a reduction
in the development of diabetes, but a post hoc analysis
identified an at-risk subgroup with higher insulin autoanti-
body titers that suggested benefit.2 Consequently, the Type 1
Diabetes TrialNet clinical trials network, which succeeded
the DPT-1 trial group, sought to further explore the role of
oral insulin in delaying diabetes among relatives who were
not significantly different from those in the subgroup who
had experienced apparent benefit from oral insulin in DPT-1.
The DPT-1 oral insulin trial enrolled relatives who were
positive for islet cell antibodies by immunofluorescence and
positive for insulin autoantibodies by radioimmunoassay,
had first-phase insulin release on intravenous glucose toler-
ance test higher than threshold (defined below), and had a
normal oral glucose tolerance test result. Since the DPT-1 oral
study was conducted, the microinsulin autoantibody assay,
which requires much less blood volume, was developed.3
Thus, TrialNet screened participants for eligibility for this
protocol using a strategy of initially testing samples for the
presence of microinsulin autoantibodies and antibodies to
glutamic acid decarboxylase and insulinoma-associated
antigen-2, with subsequent testing for islet cell autoantibod-
ies among patients who had tested positive for the antibody.4
This trial, therefore, differed from the DPT-1 oral study by
using the microinsulin autoantibody assay instead of the
radioimmunoassay to detect insulin autoantibodies and by
initially testing for microinsulin autoantibodies, glutamic
acid decarboxylase autoantibodies, and insulinoma-
associated antigen-2 autoantibodies compared with initial
testing for islet cell autoantibodies and subsequent testing
for insulin autoantibodies using the radioimmunoassay in
islet cell autoantibody-positive participants. Additionally, to
test whether the outcome would extend to microinsulin
autoantibody–positive individuals not eligible for enrollment
in the previous DPT-1 trial, this study included 4 separate
strata according to additional antibodies and first-phase insu-
lin release status.
Methods
Protocols for this trial were approved by institutional review
boards or ethics committees at all 87 participating locations
in the United States, Canada, Sweden, Finland, Italy, United
Kingdom, Australia, Germany, and New Zealand. Study
coordination, laboratory tests, and data management were
conducted centrally. Participants, their parents, or both pro-
vided written informed consent.
Screening and Eligibility
Potential participants were identified through participation in
the TrialNet Natural History Study (subsequently renamed the
TrialNet Pathway to Prevention Study).5 Nondiabetic rela-
tives of probands with type 1 diabetes were screened at insti-
tutional review board–approved sites after informed consent
was obtained. These included first-degree relatives (sibling,
parent, or child) who were aged 3 through 45 years, as well as
second- or third-degree relatives (niece, nephew, aunt, uncle,
cousin) who were aged 3 through 20 years. Initial screening
was for diabetes autoantibodies—antibodies to microinsulin,
glutamic acid decarboxylase, and insulinoma-associated an-
tigen-2. Islet cell autoantibodies were measured if at least 1
other antibody tested positive. Race/ethnicity was included as
part of federal reporting requirements, based on participant
self-report of fixed categories determined by the National
Institutes of Health.
Eligible participants were nondiabetic relatives of
patients with type 1 diabetes, who had normal glucose toler-
ance on an oral glucose tolerance test, who were confirmed
to have tested positive for the microinsulin autoantibody
on 2 sample collections, who did not have the diabetes-
protective human leukocyte antigen haplotypes DQA1*0102
and DQB1*0602, and who met criteria for the following pri-
mary and secondary study strata based on other autoanti-
bodies and metabolic characteristics.
Primary Analysis Stratum
The primary objective of the study was to assess the effects
of treatment within this stratum.
Eligible participants had to have either islet cell autoan-
tibodies (≥10 juvenile diabetes foundation units) confirmed
positive on 2 sample collections, or if not confirmed for islet
cell autoantibodies, both glutamic acid decarboxylase and in-
sulinoma-associatedantigen-2autoantibodytestedpositiveon
the same sample with confirmation of at least 1 of these auto-
antibodies required on a separate sample. Participants had to
have first-phase insulin release higher than the threshold de-
termined from the sum of the 1- and 3-minute insulin values
from an intravenous glucose tolerance test. For participants
aged 3 through 7 years or parents of probands with type 1 dia-
betes, the threshold was 60 μU/mL or higher. For siblings or
offspring aged 8 through 45 years or other relatives aged 8
through 20 years, the threshold was 100 μU/mL or higher.
These were the same thresholds used in the DPT-1 study.1,2
Thesecondaryobjectivesweretoassesstheeffectsoftreat-
ment in each stratum and in the entire group enrolled (the 4
strata combined).
Secondary Stratum 1: Identical to the primary stratum ex-
cept participants had first-phase insulin release lower than
the thresholds defined above.
Key Points
Question Can oral insulin delay or prevent clinically diagnosed
type 1 diabetes?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 389
participants in the primary analysis who were first- and
second-degree relatives of patients with type 1 diabetes, oral
insulin compared with placebo did not significantly reduce the risk
of diabetes onset over a median of 2.7 years (insulin group, 28.5%
and placebo group, 33%; hazard ratio, 0.87).
Meaning Oral insulin as used in this study was not effective in
prevention of type 1 diabetes.

 Secondary Stratum 2: Islet cell autoantibodies not con-
firmed, or glutamic acid decarboxylase or insulinoma-
associated antigen-2 autoantibody positive and confirmed on
a separate sample (those confirmed for islet cell autoantibod-
ies are in the primary stratum). In this stratum, participants
also had first-phase insulin release higher than the thresholds
defined in the primary stratum.
Secondary Stratum 3: Identical to secondary stratum 2
except participants had first-phase insulin release lower than
the thresholds defined in the primary stratum above. Other
entry criteria included normal glucose tolerance by oral
glucose tolerance test, or if they had a previous abnormal
glucose tolerance, 2 consecutive oral glucose tolerance tests
with normal glucose tolerance. Abnormal glucose tolerance
was defined as it was in DPT-11,2 using the standard criteria in
effect at the initiation of DPT-1: fasting plasma glucose of
more than 110 mg/dL; and/or 2-hour plasma glucose of more
than 140 mg/dL; and/or 30-, 60-, or 90-minute plasma glu-
cose of more than 200 mg/dL (to convert glucose from mg/dL
to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0555).
Full exclusion criteria are available in the protocol
(Supplement 1).
Randomization and Masking
After participants signed the consent form, completed screen-
ing visits, met all of the inclusion criteria and none of the ex-
clusion criteria, and completed the baseline procedures, they
were randomized in equal allocations to each treatment group
via a computerized random-number generator. Randomiza-
tion was stratified by study site, and block size was a varia-
tion of size 2 and 4. Randomization was not stratified by stra-
tum. Treatment assignment was double masked. Outcome
assessments were conducted without knowledge of treat-
ment assignment.
Intervention
Participants were assigned to receive capsules of either oral
insulin, 7.5 mg of recombinant human insulin crystals
(Eli Lilly), or matched placebo. This was the same dose used
in the DPT-1 study.2 Capsules were prepared with methylcel-
lulose filler at a compounding pharmacy (Eminent Services
Corp) and masked bottles were shipped to the clinical sites.
All participants were requested to take 1 capsule of study
medication daily for the duration of the study. Study medica-
tion was dispensed at each 6-month visit. Participants con-
sumed the capsule as a single daily dose, either by taking the
capsule or, if the participant could not swallow capsules,
sprinkling its contents in juice or on food.
Assessments
Participants were seen every 6 months. At those visits,
an oral glucose tolerance test was performed to assess
whether diabetes had developed. Criteria for diabetes onset
were, as defined by the American Diabetes Association
(ADA), based on glucose testing or the presence of unequivo-
cal hyperglycemia with acute metabolic decompensation.6
Specific criteria for diabetes onset is defined as the presence
of symptoms of diabetes plus casual (random) plasma glu-
cose of 200 mg/dL or higher or fasting plasma glucose of
126 mg/dL or higher, or 2-hour plasma glucose of 200 mg/dL
or higher. The criteria must have been met on 2 occasions as
soon as possible but no less than 1 day apart for diabetes to be
diagnosed. It was preferred that at least 1 of the 2 testing
occasions involved an oral glucose tolerance test. Tolerance
tests were performed after an overnight fast. Blood samples
were drawn through a temporary indwelling intravenous
catheter. For the oral glucose tolerance test, the oral glucose
dose was 1.75 g/kg (maximum, 75 g).
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the elapsed time from random
treatment assignment to the development of diabetes among
those enrolled in the primary analysis stratum, consisting of
participants with insulin autoimmunity and first-phase insu-
lin release that was higher than the threshold. Secondary
outcomes included the effects of oral insulin treatment vs
placebo in each stratum and in all strata combined, the con-
sistency of oral insulin vs placebo treatment effect among
strata, various subgroup analyses, and longitudinal analyses
to assess the effects of oral insulin vs placebo over time.
Other secondary outcomes such as the association of demo-
graphic, genetic, immunologic, metabolic, and lifestyle fac-
tors are not reported herein.
Additional exploratory analyses were planned and devel-
oped by the TrialNet protocol committee and finalized before
the study results were unblinded and included analyses that
incorporates factors such as duration of oral insulin use, age
of enrollment, specific autoantibody pairs, year of enroll-
ment, site of enrollment, sex, time to dysglycemia as a time-
dependent covariate, baseline insulin autoantibody titer, time
to dysglycemia, changes in autoantibody levels or positivity,
hemoglobin A1c as an outcome, C-peptide levels at diagnosis,
the presence of symptoms at the time of diagnosis, consis-
tency of hazard rates, and association between adherence to
oral insulin and results. Of these additional analyses, the re-
lationship between adherence to oral insulin and results is
reported herein and in eFigure 2 in Supplement 2. Addition-
ally, a post hoc hazard rate comparison with the DPT-1 study
was also completed and is reported herein.
Statistical Methods
Diabetes Risk
The cumulative incidence of diabetes onset over time since
randomization within each group was estimated from a
modified Kaplan-Meier estimate of the “diabetes-free” sur-
vival function. The difference between groups in the cumula-
tive incidence functions and the associated hazard functions
was tested using the Mantel log-rank test on discrete time
to type 1 diabetes (6-month intervals). The relative risk
of diabetes onset between groups was estimated from the
discrete Cox proportional hazards model.7 The critical value
for the test statistic, P = .047, and CIs in the primary analy-
sis were adjusted for a single interim analysis based on the
Lan-DeMets spending function.8

tested using the intention-to-treat principle in the primary and

 secondary analysis strata, each consisting of participants de-
finedusingdifferentcombinationsofautoantibodiesandmeta-
bolic status using the same analyses as above for the primary
analysis. An additional analysis assessed the effect of treat-
ment within all strata combined using a Cox proportional haz-
ards model stratified by stratum. Significance was based on
a 1-sided threshold of .05, and 1-sided 95% CIs are reported.
The study was designed as a maximum information trial,
which did not include a fixed sample size. Instead, partici-
pants were recruited and followed up until the required
amount of statistical information was achieved.9 At any point
during the study, the information in the data for a log-rank
test is provided by I = (DOI×DC)/(DOI+DC), for which DOI and
DC refer to the number of participants who developed diabe-
tes in the oral insulin and control groups, respectively.
The information required to provide 85% power to detect
a 40% risk reduction (identical to the DPT-1 Oral Insulin
Trial)2 with a 1-sided log-rank test at the .05 significance level
is I = 27.551. All but 7 participants contributed to the analysis
in the primary stratum. No attempt was made to impute
missing data and no adjustment has been made for multiple
comparisons, except the interim monitoring and multivariate
analyses. Consequently, all but the primary analysis should
be considered exploratory. Except for the post hoc hazard
rate comparison with the DPT-1 study, the primary and sec-
ondary analyses were prespecified, and the exploratory
analyses were preplanned.
Statistical analyses were performed using TIBCO Spotfire
S+ 8.2 (PerkinElmer). Data on adverse events and efficacy were
evaluated twice yearly by an independent data and safety
monitoring board with predefined stopping rules.
Results
Participants in this study were relatives of patients with
type 1 diabetes who tested positive for multiple autoanti-
bodies and had normal glucose tolerance at the time of ran-
domization. Screening of 138 385 individuals for potential
enrollment began in March 2004. The first participant was
randomized March 2, 2007, and the last participant, Decem-
ber 21, 2015. For the entire cohort, the randomization rate
was a mean of 5 participants per month, and for the primary
stratum, 3.5 participants per month. The database for this
report was locked January 20, 2017.
Of those screened, 3583 (2.56%) tested positive for
microinsulin autoantibodies so were potentially eligible for
this study. Of these, 2068 tested positive for microinsulin
autoantibodies (Figure 1). A total of 560 participants were
randomized, including 389 in the primary stratum. In the
secondary strata, 55 participants were randomized in sec-
ondary stratum 1, 114 participants in secondary stratum 2,
and 2 participants in secondary stratum 3. In the entire
cohort, the median age at enrollment was 8.2 years (IQR,
5.7-12.1 years), 60% were boys, more than 90.7% were non-
Hispanic white, and 57.6% had a sibling diagnosed with
type 1 diabetes. The Table shows the baseline participant
characteristics by treatment group for the entire cohort, for
the primary stratum, and for the secondary strata. There
were no substantial imbalances between treatment groups.
Follow-up
Participants were followed up for a median of 2.7 years
(IQR, 1.5-4.7 years) for the entire cohort; a median of 2.7
years (IQR, 1.5-4.6 years) for the primary stratum. A total of
173 participants (31%) were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes
in the entire cohort and 120 (31%) in the primary stratum,
were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Based on the number
of participants diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, study design
parameters were met (I = 30.0).
Lost or Withdrawn From Study
The lost-to-follow-up rate was 4.0% per year. Ten randomized
participantswereneverevaluatedfortype1diabetesandnever
underwent an oral glucose tolerance test after randomization
(7 in the oral insulin; 3 in the placebo group; 5 and 2, respec-
tively, for just the primary stratum). If these participants are re-
moved, the rate of lost to follow-up was 3.3% per year.
Outcome Data
In the primary analysis stratum, diabetes was diagnosed in 120
participants—58 in the oral insulin group and 62 in the pla-
cebo group (Figure 2A). The annualized rate of diabetes was
not significantly different between the 2 groups: 8.8% (95%
CI, 6.7%-11.2%) with oral insulin and 10.2% (95% CI, 7.8%-
12.9%) with placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87; 95% CI, 0-1.2;
P = .21).Treatmentsitewasnotasignificantfactorwhentested
either as a fixed effect in a mixed-effects model or in the Cox
proportional hazards model.
Of the 55 patients in secondary stratum 1 (ie, with first-
phase insulin release lower than threshold), diabetes was
diagnosed in 32 participants—13 in the oral insulin group
and 19 in the placebo group (Figure 2B). The annualized rate
of diabetes was 18.1% (95% CI, 9.6%-29.1%) for the oral
insulin group and 34.1% (95% CI, 20.6%-51.1%) for the pla-
cebo group (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0-0.82; P = .006). Thus, the
median time to diabetes for the oral insulin group was 55.3
months (IQR, 19.2-67.5 months) and was 24.3 months
(IQR, 13.3-47.3 months) for the placebo group, a difference
of 31.0 months.
In secondary strata 2 and 3 (combined), diabetes was di-
agnosed in 21 participants—11 in the oral insulin group and 10
in the placebo group. The annualized rate of diabetes for this
combined stratum was 5.1% (95% CI, 2.6%-8.6%) in the oral
insulin group and 4.7% (95% CI, 2.2%-8.0%) for the placebo
group (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0-2.11; P = .53; Figure 2C).
In the entire cohort, diabetes was diagnosed in 173
participants—82 in the oral insulin group and 91 in the pla-
cebo group. The annualized rate of diabetes was 8.7% (95% CI,
6.9%-10.7%) and 10.4% (95% CI, 8.3%-12.6%) in the oral and
placebo treatment groups, respectively (HR, 0.83; 95% CI,
0-1.07; P = .11; Figure 2D).
Because the primary stratum in this study was designed
to be consistent with the DPT-1 Study subgroup with baseline
radioimmunoassay insulin autoantibodies of more than 80,

 0-1.04; P = .06). In examining Kaplan-Meier curves for the
primary stratum that included participants with varying
degrees of adherence among more adherent participants,
there was separation between the oral insulin and placebo
groups during the first 24 months after randomization.
Therefore, in an analysis of the first 24 months’follow-up of
adherent participants in the primary stratum, a protective
association was observed among those taking oral insulin
with fewer participants progressing to diabetes than among
those taking placebo—the annualized rate of diabetes was
2.4% with oral insulin and 6.9% with placebo (HR, 0.348;
95% CI, 0-0.855; P = .02). This exploratory analysis is
included in the eAppendix in Supplement 2.
Adverse Events
There were no serious adverse events and no reported epi-
sodes of severe hypoglycemia. The most common adverse
event was categorized as infection, with 134 and 120 events

 diabetes in antibody-positive relatives of patients with type
1 diabetes in the primary stratum or in the entire random-
ized group.
Oral antigen administration has had small and inconsis-
tent benefits in clinical trials involving patients with multiple
sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, despite success in animal
models of those autoimmune diseases. Among patients who
have been newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, oral insulin,
at the same or lower doses than the dose levels studied in
this trial, failed to preserve pancreatic islet β-cell function.10
In the DPT-1 study, 7.5 mg/d of oral insulin failed to delay
or prevent type 1 diabetes in the study as a whole.2 How-
ever, a post hoc analysis of data from DPT-1 revealed that
autoantibody-positive relatives with higher confirmed radio-
immunoassay insulin autoantibody titers progress to diabe-
tes at a faster rate than participants with lower or uncon-
firmed insulin autoantibodies, and this subgroup may have
benefitted from oral insulin.2 Participants with insulin auto-
antibodies that were 80 nU/mL or higher and who were
treated with 7.5/d of oral insulin had an apparent 4- to 5-year
delay in the onset of disease.
Because this study was undertaken to replicate the DPT-1
subgroup finding, the same 7.5-mg/d of oral insulin was used.
However, immunomodulatory effects were reported with
higher doses of oral insulin in preclinical studies and in a
small-dose escalation study of children early in the disease
process. The Pre-Point study11 found potentially protective
immunomodulatory effects only in the 6 children who
received the highest dose of oral insulin studied (67.5 mg/d).
Therefore, as a companion study to the clinical trial reported
herein, TrialNet has recently completed enrollment of more
than 90 antibody-positive relatives in a study aimed at deter-
mining whether higher doses of oral insulin administered
daily or every other week have measurable immunomodula-
tory effects (NCT02580877).
In a prespecified, secondary analysis in the current trial,
a significant protective effect was found in the stratum con-
sisting of 55 individuals in whom the first-phase insulin
response was lower than the threshold needed for entry
into the primary stratum. The placebo group in this stratum
had a higher rate of progression to type 1 diabetes than par-
ticipants taking placebo in the primary stratum (34.1%-
10.2%), attesting to the added diabetes risk among those
with diminished first-phase insulin release. However,
because there was no adjustment for multiple comparisons,
this analysis must be considered exploratory and hypoth-
esis generating.
Although requiring a large, multicenter network, this trial
emphasizes the feasibility of identifying and treating indi-
viduals early in the type 1 diabetes disease process. Individu-
als with 2 or more antibodies are destined (>80% risk at 10
years) to develop clinical type 1 diabetes, albeit at various
rates of progression.24 Individuals with 2 or more antibodies
and normal glucose tolerance are now considered to have
stage 1 type 1 diabetes.12 Without intervention, most of these
individuals will develop stage 2 type 1 diabetes, manifested
by abnormal glucose tolerance and eventually clinically
apparent, or stage 3 type 1 diabetes. As noted in this study,
the overall rate of progression from stage 1 to stage 3 was
approximately 9.5% per year; not significantly different from
the rate of progression in genetically at-risk infants who were
followed up from birth.12
Thus, trials of disease-modifying therapies among indi-
viduals with multiple antibodies could be considered treat-
ment trials, in which the therapy aims to treat early type 1
diabetes or islet autoimmunity as distinct from prevention
trials, which implies testing of therapies in healthy indi-
viduals to prevent disease. Most randomized clinical trials
investigating type 1 diabetes–modifying therapy have been
conducted among individuals with clinically overt dis-
ease. Disease-modifying therapies including the anti-CD3
monoclonal antibody, 13-19 rituximab,18-21 abatacept,22 and
alefacept23 significantly preserved insulin production (as
measured by C-peptide levels) as well having immunologi-
cal effects in the first 1 to 2 years after diagnosis of clinical
disease. As demonstrated in the Diabetes Control and Com-
plications Trial (DCCT),24,25 improved short-term diabetes
control associated with sustained C-peptide production
decreased the risk of complications. However, an effect at
earlier stages of the disease in delaying onset of clinical
diagnosis of diabetes would have a much more profound
effect in relieving the burden of disease. Despite marked
advances in insulin delivery and glucose monitoring, there
are still significant unmet needs for disease modifying
therapy in type 1 diabetes.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, there was a change
in insulin autoantibody assay methods from the DPT-1 Oral
Insulin study. The change in assay may have contributed to
an inability to replicate previous results from the study
using a 7.5-mg fixed dose of oral insulin because the
selected study population for this trial may differ slightly
from the population in the previous study that showed
apparent benefit. Second, as in other type 1 diabetes preven-
tion trials, there is the limited knowledge about and the
ability to incorporate heterogeneity in the pathogenesis of
disease. This trial enrolled participants based on evidence
of autoimmunity but did not take into account genetic back-
ground, age at onset, and type of first-appearing diabetes-
related autoantibody. The emerging literature now suggests
that future trials need to consider these factors, and this
trial adds to that, suggesting that first-phase insulin release
status and treatment adherence should also be incorporated
into study designs. Third, due to lack of adjustment for mul-
tiple comparisons, all secondary analyses need to be inter-
preted as exploratory.
Conclusions
Among autoantibody-positive relatives of patients with type
1 diabetes, oral insulin at a dose of 7.5 mg/d, compared with
placebo, did not delay or prevent the development of type 1
diabetes over 2.7 years. These findings do not support oral
insulin as used in this study for diabetes prevention.
