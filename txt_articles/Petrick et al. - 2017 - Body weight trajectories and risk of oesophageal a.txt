Background: Elevated body mass index (BMI, kg m � 2) has been consistently associated with oesophageal adenocarcinoma (EA)
and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) incidence. However, effects of adiposity over the life course in relation to EA/GCA have
not been thoroughly explored.
Methods: We pooled two prospective cohort studies: NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study and Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and
Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, with data on 409 796 individuals (633 EA, 415 GCA). At baseline, participants reported their
height and weight at ages 20 and 50 years, and current. Body mass index trajectories were determined using latent class analysis.
Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using proportional hazards regression.
Results: Compared with individuals with a BMIo25 kg m � 2 at all time points, exceeding a BMI of 25 kg m � 2 at age 20 was
associated with increased risks of EA (HR ¼ 1.76, 95% CI: 1.35–2.29) and GCA (HR ¼ 1.62, 95% CI: 1.16–2.25). Similarly, a BMI
trajectory of overweight (X25–o30 kg m � 2) at age 20 progressing to obesity (X30 kg m � 2) by age 50 was associated with
increased risks of EA (HR ¼ 2.90, 95% CI: 1.67–5.04) and GCA (HR ¼ 4.07, 95% CI: 2.32–7.15), compared with individuals with a
normal weight (X18.5–o25 kg m � 2) trajectory. Weight gain of X20 kg between age 20 and baseline was also associated with a
two times increased risk of EA (HR ¼ 1.97, 95% CI: 1.43–2.73) and more modestly with GCA (HR ¼ 1.40, 95% CI: 0.96–2.05).
Conclusions: Being overweight in early adulthood and weight gain later in life were each associated with increased risks of
EA and GCA. This underscores the potential of weight control programs for reducing EA and GCA risk.
Over the last two decades, oesophageal and gastric cardia
adenocarcinomas (EA/GCA) have been among the most rapidly
increasing cancer types in the USA and in other Western countries
(Devesa et al, 1998; Simard et al, 2012). Oesophageal adenocarci-
noma and GCA have overlapping pathogeneses, they are both
glandular epithelial cancers originating in or near the gastro-
esophageal junction, and they have similar risk factor profiles and
5-year survival rates of B26% (Wijnhoven et al, 1999). Increasing
rates of obesity in the general population have generally paralleled
the increasing rates of EA/GCA. Elevated body mass index (BMI,
kg m � 2) has consistently been shown to be associated with
incidence of EA and GCA (Hoyo et al, 2012). Although the
underlying causal mechanisms that result in altered cancer risks
are unclear, leading hypotheses include the ideas that high levels
of
adiposity
may
promote
gastroesophageal
reflux
disease
(Wild and Hardie, 2003) and/or metabolic sequelae (Reid et al,
2003; Ryan et al, 2011).
Meta-analyses have reported associations between BMI, waist
circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio and increased EA/GCA risk
(Hoyo et al, 2012; Singh et al, 2013). However, few studies to date

 have examined early adulthood body weight (Chow et al, 1998;
Lagergren et al, 1999; Cheng et al, 2000; Wu et al, 2001; Merry
et al, 2007) and body weight change (Chow et al, 1998; Merry et al,
2007); all reported increased risks of EA/GCA with early adulthood
obesity and weight gain. One study examined the association
between trajectories of body shape, but not BMI, and EA risk.
There was a suggestive association between the trajectories where
individuals reported being lean in early life and heavy in later life
or remaining heavy throughout their life and increased EA risk.
However, this study had a small EA sample size (n ¼ 98) and did
not examine GCA (Song et al, 2015). As the prevalence of obesity
(BMIX30 kg m � 2) is expected to continue to increase (Finkelstein
et al, 2012), it is vital to understand the timing of obesity and
weight gains in relation to EA and GCA outcomes. This may
provide mechanistic insight and inform the time window of when
interventions may be successfully implemented to reduce the
incidence of these highly lethal cancers.
In the current study, we pooled data from the National
Institutes of Health (NIH)-AARP Diet and Health Study with
the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer
Screening
Trial
to examine
the
relationship
between
early
adulthood BMI, weight change, average BMI, and BMI trajectories
and risk of EA/GCA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population. We utilised data from two study populations –
the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, and the PLCO Cancer
Screening Trial. These studies were combined because the
inclusion criteria and available data were very similar. Thus, data
variables could be harmonised, allowing for a larger sample size to
examine the rare outcomes of EA and GCA. Both study protocols
were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National
Cancer Institute.
The NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study is a prospective cohort
study conducted in six states (California, Florida, Louisiana, New
Jersey, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania) and two metropolitan
areas (Atlanta, Georgia and Detroit, Michigan; Schatzkin et al,
2001). Eligible participants were male and female AARP members,
aged 50–71 years at the time of study recruitment. In 1995–1996,
eligible members were mailed a baseline questionnaire, which
assessed current anthropometric measurements, demographics,
diet, and medical history. Six months later, participants who
completed the baseline questionnaire and did not self-report colon,
breast, or prostate cancer were mailed a risk factor questionnaire
(RFQ), which asked about additional exposures including recalled
anthropometric measurements. Participants who completed the
RFQ were more likely to be female, white, and have a college
degree, compared to individuals whom completed only the baseline
questionnaire (Supplementary Table S1). Of the 337 071 partici-
pants who completed the RFQ, individuals who died (n ¼ 1619) or
moved (n ¼ 547) before the RFQ was scanned were excluded. In
addition, individuals with a proxy report on baseline or RFQ
(n ¼ 10 383), cancer diagnosis prior to RFQ (n ¼ 18 721), zero
follow-up time (n ¼ 30), or death report only of cancer (n ¼ 2451)
were excluded from our analysis. Finally, we excluded individuals
with a missing value for BMI at age 18, 50, or baseline (n ¼ 28 686)
or with implausible BMI values (o15 or 460 kg m � 2, n ¼ 3363).
Our final analytic cohort from the NIH-AARP Study consisted of
271 271 individuals.
The PLCO Cancer Screening Trial is a randomised controlled
trial conducted at 10 study sites (Washington, DC; Detroit,
Michigan; Marshfield, Wisconsin; Honolulu, Hawaii; Birmingham,
Alabama; Aurora, Colorado; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania; Boise, Idaho; and St Louis, Missouri; Kramer et al,
1993). Eligible participants were men and women, aged 50–79
years at the time of study recruitment. In 1993–2001, eligible
participants completed a self-administered baseline questionnaire,
which assessed anthropometric measurements, demographics, and
medical history. Of the 149 943 participants who completed the
baseline questionnaire, individuals with a prior cancer diagnosis
(n ¼ 6907), self or death report of cancer only (n ¼ 192), zero
follow-up time (n ¼ 795), or age o50 years (n ¼ 1) were excluded
from our analysis. In addition, we excluded individuals with a
missing value for BMI at age 20, 50, or baseline (n ¼ 3462) or with
implausible BMI values (o15 or 460 kg m � 2, n ¼ 61). Our final
analytic cohort from the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial consisted of
138 525 individuals.
Outcomes. Study participants were followed for incident primary
diagnoses of histologically verified EA or GCA through 31
December 2011, for NIH-AARP (Schatzkin et al, 2001) and 31
December 2009, for PLCO (Kramer et al, 1993). Oesophageal
cancer (defined as International Classification of Disease for
Oncology, 3rd edition [ICD-O-3] diagnostic code C15.0–C15.9)
and gastric cardia cancer (ICD-O-3 diagnostic code C16.0) for
NIH-AARP participants was ascertained by linkage to state cancer
registries (including states of participant recruitment and Arizona,
Nevada, and Texas), which is estimated to capture B90% of all
cancer cases (Michaud et al, 2005), and for PLCO participants was
ascertained through self-report and subsequent medical records
verification. Cases were then classified as adenocarcinoma (ICD-O-
3 histology codes of 8140-8575). The current analysis included 633
EA cases, 415 GCA cases, and 408 748 non-cases.
Exposures. Both studies asked participants to report their current
height and weight at baseline. Participants also reported recalled
weight at ages 18 (NIH-AARP) or 20 (PLCO) years – for simplicity
we will refer to this as age 20 for both studies – and 50 years. The
NIH-AARP questionnaire additionally asked participants to report
maximal weight. Body mass index, calculated as weight in
kilograms (kg) divided by height in metres (m) squared (kg m � 2),
was examined as a continuous metric and as a categorical metric,
the latter according to World Health Organisation definitions:
underweight (o18.5), normal weight (18.5–24.9), overweight
(25.0–29.9), and obese (X30.0; WHO, 2000).
Body mass index was assessed at discrete age points – age 20
years, age 50 years, and age at baseline. We also examined
age when BMI first exceeded 25 kg m � 2 (Adams et al, 2014). In
addition, we examined both average BMI, between these age
points, and maximal BMI as predictors. Weight change between
these ages was defined as p � 2, 4 � 2 to o5 (stable weight,
referent), 5 to o15, and X15 kg (de Mutsert et al, 2014). To
further explore excess weight gain, we examined an additional
model where the highest category of weight change was defined as
X20 kg. Thus, the categories were defined as p2, 42–o5,
5–o15, 15–o20, and X20 kg.
Body mass index trajectories were determined utilising latent
class group-based mixture model analysis (PROC TRAJ, SAS 9.3,
SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) (Jones and Nagin, 2007). This
allowed us to group individuals with similar BMI patterns between
the ages of 20, 50, and baseline. We allowed 3–5 trajectory
categories as well as linear or quadratic patterns of BMI change.
The optimal number of categories and model pattern was selected
using the change in Bayesian Information Criterion and the mean
posterior probability of each trajectory, where each trajectory
grouping was required to include at least 1% of participants. Thus,
we selected four trajectory categories (stable normal BMI, normal
BMI to overweight, normal BMI to obese, and overweight to
obese), with quadratic patterns of BMI change.
Statistical analysis. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis
was used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95%

 confidence intervals (CIs) for the association of adiposity with EA
and GCA, with age as the underlying time metric. Follow-up of the
analytic cohort occurred from time at completion of RFQ
questionnaire (NIH-AARP) or baseline questionnaire (PLCO)
until an event (i.e., incident EA or GCA) or right censoring (i.e.,
other cancer diagnosis, death, loss to follow-up, or last date of
follow-up), whichever occurred first. In models examining GCA as
the primary outcome, EA was a censored event, and vice versa. The
proportional
hazards
assumption
was
tested
by
examining
interactions between BMI (defined as continuous and categorical)
and log (time) in models that included confounders; no violation of
this assumption was observed (PX0.05).
Effect modification by sex, cigarette smoking, diabetes, physical
activity, and study was assessed using likelihood ratio tests that
compared regression models with and without a multiplicative
term (Kleinbaum, 2002). Potential confounders (Rothman et al,
2008) included alcohol consumption, aspirin and NSAID use,
diabetes, education, fruit/vegetable intake, marital status, physical
activity, race/ethnicity, red/white meat intake, smoking, and total
energy intake. Variables remained in the adjusted model if they
were associated with the exposure and outcome, and variable
elimination changed the log HR by X10% (Rothman et al, 2008);
sex, race (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, other),
smoking (never/current/former, and categorised cigarettes per
day (0, 1–10, 11–20, 21–30, 31–40, 41–60, 61 þ )), and education
(high school or less, technical school or some college, college
graduate, postgraduate) met this criterion and were included in all
final models. We adjusted for study in all models. Models for
weight were additionally adjusted for height. Analyses were
conducted using SAS version 9.3. Tests of linear trend were
conducted using continuous variables. All P-values are two-sided.
Sensitivity analyses. As a sensitivity analysis, we adjusted weight
change models for average weight (Oldham, 1962; Tu and
Gilthorpe, 2007), to determine if weight gain increased the risk
of EA/GCA beyond what is conferred by average lifetime weight
alone.
RESULTS
Demographic characteristics of EA and GCA cases, and non-cases
are shown in Table 1. Compared with non-cases, individuals who
developed EA or GCA were more likely to be older, male, non-
Hispanic white, and have ever-smoked cigarettes.
Table 2 presents associations between BMI metrics – that is BMI
at ages 20 and 50 years, age at baseline, maximal, and time at which
BMI first exceeded the threshold of 25 kg m � 2 – in relation to risks
of EA and GCA. Overweight at age 20 was associated with
increased risks of EA (HRoverweight ¼ 1.31, 95% CI: 1.06–1.63) and
GCA (HRoverweight ¼ 1.39, 95% CI: 1.05–1.83), but obesity was not
associated with a significantly increased risk of EA (HRobese ¼ 1.44,
95% CI: 0.85–2.46) or GCA (HRobese ¼ 1.02, 95% CI: 0.45–2.29).
However, this could be due to small sample size in the obese
category at age 20, as the trend is still significant. The associations
between overweight and obesity at age 50 years and EA
(HRoverweight ¼ 1.34, 95% CI: 1.11–1.61; HRobese ¼ 2.09, 95% CI:
1.66–2.65) and GCA (HRoverweight ¼ 1.39, 95% CI: 1.11–1.75;

 HRobese ¼ 1.63, 95% CI: 1.19–2.23) were similar to risk estimates
for BMI at study baseline. The group of participants whom first
exceed the threshold of 25 kg m � 2 at age 20 had a 60–70%
increased risk of EA and GCA (HR ¼ 1.76, 95% CI: 1.35–2.29;
HR ¼ 1.62, 95% CI: 1.16–2.25, respectively), compared with
individuals who had a BMI of o25 kg m � 2 throughout their
lifetime; associations were weaker among those first exceeding a
BMI of 25 kg m � 2 at age 50 or baseline age.
Early adulthood weight change (i.e., age 20–50 years) of 15 kg or
more was associated with modest increased risks of EA (HR ¼ 1.26,
95% CI: 0.98–1.62). Risk estimates for EA were higher when a change
of 15 kg occurred after age 50 (i.e., age 50 years to baseline;
HR ¼ 1.57, 95% CI: 1.19–2.08). However, total lifetime weight change
(i.e., age 20 years to baseline) was strongly associated with EA risk in
a dose-response pattern culminating in a HR of 1.97 (95% CI: 1.43–
2.73) for individuals who had gained 20 kg or more. Associations
with GCA were generally similar to EA. When we further adjusted
these models for average weight, the results were slightly attenuated,
but estimates for the relationship between lifetime increases in weight
and EA/GCA risk remained similar (Table 3).
Overweight or obese average BMI across all time points was
associated with an increased risk of both cancer types (Table 4).
Average lifetime BMI between age 20 and baseline of 30 kg m � 2 or
more was most strongly associated with EA risk (HR ¼ 2.51, 95%
CI: 1.91–3.31), whereas a two times increased risk was seen at each
time point for GCA risk.

study. However, analyses stratified by sex and study are provided
in Supplementary Tables S2–S17, respectively.

 DISCUSSION
In this pooled analysis of two large prospective studies, the results
indicate that continued increases in excess weight across the life
course, particularly when exposure begins by early adulthood, is
associated with increased risks of EA and GCA. The strongest
associations between adiposity and EA/GCA were observed for
individuals who had a trajectory of overweight at the onset of
adulthood and progressed to obesity in later life. Among this
group of individuals, we found a three times or more increased
risk of both EA and GCA. Similarly, individuals who first reported

 being overweight at age 20 had 60–70% increased risks of EA
and GCA.
Our findings extend previous analyses, which have indicated
that early adult weight or adult weight change are important in
conferring increased risks for EA and GCA (Chow et al, 1998;
Lagergren et al, 1999; Cheng et al, 2000; Wu et al, 2001; Merry
et al, 2007; Cook et al, 2015) by using correct weight change model
specification (Oldham, 1962; Tu and Gilthorpe, 2007) and
trajectory modelling (Jones and Nagin, 2007). These approaches
have enabled us to identify critical periods for obesity and
weight gain, specifically early adult obesity and adult weight gain.
One previous study, utilising data from the Nurses’ Health
Study and Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, reported a two
times increased risk of EA associated with a body shape trajectory
of heavy-stable/increasing. However, this study had a small
sample size to examine EA (n ¼ 98), and did not consider GCA
(Song et al, 2015).
We report that a weight gain of X20 kg between age 20 and
baseline is associated with a 97% increased risk of EA, compared to
stable weight. In contrast, a study utilising data from the Health
Professionals Follow-up Study examined obesity-related cancers
collectively (i.e., colorectal, renal, pancreatic, and oesophageal) and
reported an 11% increase in risk of obesity-related cancer
associated with X15 kg gained between age 21 and baseline
assessment (de Mutsert et al, 2014). Although the sample size in
this prior study was limited and EA could not be examined as a
distinct outcome, our findings of a stronger association between
weight change from age 20 to baseline and EA could indicate that
gaining weight during adulthood is more important for EA than
other obesity-related cancer types. Our results are in line with two
previous studies that have examined EA and GCA as distinct
outcomes conducted in The Netherlands (Merry et al, 2007) and
the USA (Chow et al, 1998). The Netherlands cohort study
reported a 3.4 and 2.1 times increased risk of EA and GCA,
respectively, associated with an 8 kg m � 2 change in BMI between
age 20 and cohort baseline (Merry et al, 2007). The US case–
control study reported a 2.1 and 1.3 times higher risk of EA and
GCA, respectively, for a X21 kg weight gain between the 20s and
typical adult weight (Chow et al, 1998).
For the sensitivity analysis, we present models of weight change
adjusted for average weight, as these are orthogonal variables
(Oldham, 1962). Simply adjusting a model of weight change for
baseline weight can produce spurious results, as they are not
independent variables (Oldham, 1962; Tu and Gilthorpe, 2007).

 For example, adjusting a model of weight change (e.g., between
ages 20 and 50 years) for weight at age 50 is essentially equivalent
to estimating the relationship of weight at age 20 with the outcome.
The same problem would occur if the weight change model was
adjusted for weight at age 20 – this model would essentially be
estimating the relationship of weight at age 50 with the outcome.
When we adjusted weight gain for average weight, we still observe
an association between large weight gains and EA/GCA risk. These
results indicate that lifetime weight gain increases the risk of EA
and GCA beyond that conferred by average lifetime weight alone.
Although the exact mechanisms underlying the association
between adiposity and EA/GCA are unclear, it is hypothesised that
central adiposity may increase intra-abdominal pressure. This
promotes gastroesophageal reflux disease, which is a risk factor for
Barrett’s esophagus (Wild and Hardie, 2003), the precursor lesion
of EA (Sharma et al, 2004). Alternatively, dysfunctional adipose
tissue may lead to metabolic sequelae, such as glucose intolerance,
hypertension, or metabolic syndrome, which may have carcino-
genic effects resulting in increased risks of EA or GCA (Reid et al,
2010; Ryan et al, 2011).
In this study, overweight and obesity at all time points was
associated with an increased risk of EA and GCA. However, the
increased risks of these cancers associated with overweight or
obesity at age 20 years suggests that childhood and adolescent
adiposity may be an important factor for these cancer types.
Although we don’t have data on childhood and adolescence
adiposity, a recent study reported that childhood obesity is
associated with an increased risk of EA (Cook et al, 2015), which
may be mediated through the moderate correlations with adult
obesity (Singh et al, 2008; Macfarlane et al, 2011). Thus, it is
possible that some of the associations reported herein are due to
‘tracking’ (correlation) of adiposity from childhood through early
and
mid-adulthood.
Alternatively,
associations
of
childhood
obesity with gastroesophageal reflux disease (Malaty et al, 2009;
Pashankar et al, 2009; Ruigomez et al, 2010; Koebnick et al, 2011)
and metabolic disorders may directly affect future risks of EA and
GCA (Adegboye et al, 2010; Abrams and Levitt Katz, 2011).
This is the first study to examine BMI trajectories in relation to
EA and GCA risks, but these trajectories are based on self-reported
and recalled age-specific weights. However, recalled weight has
been shown to be highly correlated with measured weight that was
assessed 20 years prior (r ¼ 0.88; Dahl and Reynolds, 2013), and
self-reported weight has been shown to be highly correlated with
measured weight over repeated measurements (r ¼ 0.97; Dahl et al,
2010). Although these correlations are high, misclassification can
occur across BMI categories (Spencer et al, 2002). Therefore,
caution is needed when interpreting studies with self-reported
body weight and height. In addition, we utilised BMI as a proxy for
body fatness, which may be an inaccurate measurement of body
fatness for an individual. However, percentage body fatness and
BMI are strongly correlated within sex-age groups (r ¼ 0.72–0.84)
(Flegal et al, 2009). Thus, BMI can be useful at the population level
for distinguishing body fatness categories (Flegal et al, 2009). We
also only had data at three time points – ages 20 and 50 years, and
age at baseline. Future studies should prospectively collect height
and weight at regular intervals for a thorough examination of the
association between adiposity over the life course and cancer
outcomes. In addition, these studies did not include information
on some important risk factors for EA and GCA. Specifically,
gastroesophageal reflux disease was not assessed, which may be an
important stratification – some individuals’ risks of EA/GCA may
be predominately mediated through gastroesophageal reflux as
opposed to putative carcinogenic effects of metabolic disorders.
Also, our study population predominately included participants of
European ancestry. However, this is the group at highest risk of
developing EA/GCA (Falk, 2009). Finally, the number of GCA
cases may be underestimated, as a large proportion of gastric
cancers with an overlapping or unknown location (i.e., C16.8-9)
may be tumours of the cardia (Corley and Kubo, 2004).
This study utilised a pooled analysis to evaluate the association
between adiposity and EA/GCA, which allowed for a larger sample
size than an individual study alone. This allowed for examination
of EA and GCA as distinct outcomes. However, even with a large
sample size, we were limited in the number of BMI trajectories we
could examine. If we had a larger sample size, we may be able to
observe enough individuals who did not gain weight or even had
weight loss over their lifetime. We were also limited in examination
of subgroups, particularly stratifications by sex given the small
number of female cases available for analysis. However, we present
the stratifications by sex and study in Supplementary Material, as
these stratifications are of interest due to the sex disparity in EA/
GCA
incidence
and
possible
between-study
heterogeneity.
Although we did not run competing risk analyses, our primary
aim was to estimate cause-specific relative risk, which does not
require independence of the outcome and competing events to
obtain valid relative risk estimates (Prentice et al, 1978). In
addition, the current study includes older USA participants only,
which reduces the generalisability of results.
In summary, this analysis of two large, mature US cohorts
provide evidence that early adulthood overweight and obesity are
strong risk factors for EA and GCA, and that large weight gains
over the life course confer high risks for these malignancies. These
results indicate that weight gain during adulthood should be
avoided to reduce the risk of EA/GCA, and underscores the
potential of weight control programs for reducing the incidence of
these highly lethal cancers.
