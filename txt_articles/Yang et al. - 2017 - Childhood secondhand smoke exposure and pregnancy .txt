ABSTRACT
Objective Studies of secondhand smoke (SHS)
exposure especially childhood SHS exposure and
pregnancy loss are limited. We used baseline data of the
Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (GBCS) to examine
the association of childhood SHS exposure with a history
of pregnancy loss.
Methods Never smoking women aged 50 years or
above in GBCS from 2003 to 2008 were included.
Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to control for
confounding. Negative binomial regression and logistic
regression were used to examine the association of
childhood SHS, assessed by number of smokers in
childhood household and frequency of exposure, with
past pregnancy loss.
Results Of 19 562 women, 56.7% (11 096) had SHS
exposure during childhood. In negative binomial
regression, after adjusting for age, education, past
occupational dust exposure, past home fuel exposure,
oral contraceptive, adulthood SHS exposure, age at first
pregnancy and age at first menarche, compared to non-
exposure, the incidence rate ratio of one more pregnancy
loss was 1.20 (95% CI1.05 to 1.37) in those who lived
with ≥2 smokers in the same household, and 1.14
(95% CI 1.04 to 1.25) in those exposed ≥5 times/week.
After similar adjustment, logistic regression showed that
the OR of pregnancy loss ≥2 times (versus 0 to 1 time)
was 1.25 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.57) and 1.20 (95% CI
1.03 to 1.40) for high density (≥2 smokers in the same
household) and frequency (≥5 times/week) of childhood
exposure, respectively.
Conclusions Childhood SHS exposure was associated
with higher risks of pregnancy loss in middle-aged and
older Chinese women.
INTRODUCTION
The prevalence of pregnancy loss, defined as the
death of an embryo or fetus before it is able to
survive independently, was 17.3% in American
women of childbearing age aged 24–44 years1 in
1992–2009 and 4.36–12.2% in Chinese women of
childbearing
age
(20–49 years)
in
1988–1997.2
There were several possible explanations for preg-
nancy loss, such as occupational and environmental
exposure and unhealthy lifestyle factors.3 Active
smoking in pregnant women or their husbands was
associated with a higher risk of pregnancy loss, and
the risk was greater for smoking during pregnancy.4
Compared with directly inhaled tobacco smoke
or mainstream smoke, the evidence indicates that
undiluted sidestream smoke, the major contributor
to secondhand smoke (SHS), contains higher levels
of chemical compounds considered to be carcino-
genic or toxic—including benzene, formaldehyde,
catechol and N-nitrosamines.5 Concerns about the
harmful effects of SHS have been increasing. Some
previous studies showed that maternal6–8 or pre-
natal9 SHS exposure in adulthood was associated
with a higher risk of pregnancy loss, but only a few
examined the association between childhood SHS
exposure and pregnancy loss.10–12 Since childhood
is a sensitive stage, such exposure to exogenous
harmful substances, during this period may lead to
adverse health outcomes in adulthood.13 14 Animal
and human studies found that exposure to tobacco
smoke adversely affected embryo development,15
suggesting that SHS exposure during childhood
may increase the risk of pregnancy loss at repro-
ductive age. However, evidence from population-
based studies on childhood SHS exposure and
pregnancy loss in adulthood is limited. W
e found
only one community-based study from the USA
showing a positive association of SHS exposure in
childhood and adulthood with the risk of preg-
nancy loss.10 To the best of our knowledge, there
are no reports from Asian populations. In China,
98% women were never smokers15 but 70.5% of
them16 were exposed to SHS in 2010. Thus, we
examined the association of childhood SHS expos-
ure with pregnancy loss in the Guangzhou Biobank
Cohort Study (GBCS), the largest population-based
cohort study of middle-aged and older Chinese
people in southern China.
METHODS
Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study
W
e used GBCS baseline data for the present ana-
lysis. Details of the methods have been reported
elsewhere.17 Briefly, GBCS is a collaborative project
among the Guangzhou 12th Hospital and the
Universities of Hong Kong and Birmingham. It is
an ongoing prospective cohort study on permanent
Guangzhou residents aged 50 years or above, and
aims to examine environmental and genetic deter-
minants
of
chronic
diseases.
Participants
were
recruited from a community social and welfare
association, the Guangzhou Health and Happiness
Association for the Respectable Elders, which is a
large
unofficial
organisation
aligned
with
the
Guangzhou municipal government and has more
than 150 branches and ∼100 000 members. Those
receiving treatment for life-threatening diseases
such as cancer, or who did not provide informed
consent, were excluded. Information on smoking,

 disease history and other factors were collected by face-to-face
computer-assisted interview.
GBCS was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the
Guangzhou
Medical
Association.
All
participants
provided
written informed consent before joining the study.
Measurement
Information on socioeconomic position and lifestyle including
age, sex, education, oral contraceptive use, smoking and alcohol
use was collected by a computer-assisted standardised question-
naire administered by trained interviewers. Education was
assessed and classified into three groups: ≤Primary school (0–
6 years), Middle school (7–12 years), ≥College (≥13 years).
Oral contraceptive use was self-reported, and the question was
as follows: Have you ever used oral contraceptives before?
Childhood was defined as the period between infancy and adult-
hood (28 days to 18 years). This is the usual definition of child-
hood in the Chinese population.
Exposure
A never smoker was defined as one who had smoked <100
cigarettes in her lifetime.18 Childhood SHS exposure was
defined as living with one or more smokers and being exposed
to the smoker’s tobacco smoke for at least 15 min/day on more
than 1 day/week in the same household during childhood.4 T
wo
self-reported SHS measures were used. The first was density,
defined by the presence of none, one or two or more smokers
living in the same household when the participant was a child.
The other was frequency, categorised into no exposure, low (<5
times/week) and high (≥5 times/week) levels of exposure (one
time of exposure was defined as exposure ≥5 consecutive
minutes). The density and frequency of childhood SHS expos-
ure based on the questions were shown to be associated with
young age at menarche in GBCS.19
Study outcome
Pregnancy loss was defined as the death of an embryo or fetus
before it is able to survive independently.20 Information on
times of pregnancy loss was obtained by self-report. Frequent
pregnancy loss was defined as pregnancy loss of ≥2 times
(versus 0 to 1). Sensitivity analysis was conducted using a
cut-off of 3 times (<3 vs ≥3 times).
Statistical analysis
W
e compared the demographic characteristics between partici-
pants with and without childhood SHS exposure using t-test
and χ2 test. Logistic regression was used to examine associations
of childhood SHS exposure with pregnancy loss.
Propensity score matching (PSM)21
22 was performed to
control for differences in baseline characteristics between those
with and without childhood SHS exposure. Multivariable logis-
tic regression including age, education, past occupational dust
exposure, past home fuel exposure, oral contraceptive, adult-
hood SHS exposure, age at first pregnancy and age at first
menarche was used to obtain propensity scores for each individ-
ual. These potential confounders were selected according to
their association with pregnancy loss on the basis of clinical
knowledge and previous studies.23
24 W
e then performed
nearest neighbour matching of the two groups at a 1:1 fixed
ratio, using a caliper width of 0.2 of the SD of the logit of the
propensity score. Balance achieved by matching was assessed by
examining differences in baseline variables between the child-
hood exposure group and no childhood exposure group before
and after PSM. Negative binomial regression analysis was used
to examine the association between childhood SHS exposure
and the times of pregnancy loss (counts). Univariate analysis,
logistic regression and propensity score matching were con-
ducted by SPSS V
.19.0 and negative binomial regression analysis
was conducted by Stata V
.12.0. A two tailed p<0.05 was consid-
ered statistically significant.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research question or
the outcome measures, and nor were they involved in the
design and implementation of the study. There are no plans to
involve patients in dissemination.
RESULTS
Of 30 518 participants of GBCS recruited from September
2003 to January 2008, 20 903 (68.5%) were female never
smokers. After excluding 842 women with missing information
on pregnancy loss and 499 women with infertility, 19 562 were
included in the present analysis (figure 1). A total of 866 (4.4%)
had pregnancy loss ≥2 times and 267 (1.4%) ≥3 times. The
mean age at first pregnancy was 24.7 (SD 3.6) years, and at first
menarche was 15.1 (SD2.1) years (Table not shown).
T
able 1 shows that 56.7% (11 096/19 562) women were
exposed to SHS during childhood. Those with childhood SHS
exposure were younger, had a lower level of education and
prevalence of past home fuel exposure and adulthood SHS
exposure, but had a higher prevalence of past occupational
dust exposure and use of oral contraceptive than those without
exposure (table 1). They also had a younger age at first menar-
che (14.9 vs 15.3 years, p<0.001) and an older age at first preg-
nancy (25.0 vs 24.5 years, p<0.001). After matching on the
propensity score (n=7782 for each group, total included:
15 564), the SD of the logit of the propensity score width was
<0.2, suggesting a successful matching.25
T
able 2 model 2 shows that, after adjusting for age, education,
past occupational dust exposure, past home fuel exposure, oral
contraceptive, adulthood SHS exposure, age at first pregnancy
and age at first menarche, compared to non-exposure, the inci-
dence rate ratio (IRR) for one more pregnancy loss in those
with childhood SHS exposure was 1.20 (95% CI1.05 to 1.37)
for those who lived with ≥2 smokers in the same household
and 1.14 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.25) for those with an exposure fre-
quency of ≥5 times/week.

 Table 3 model 2 shows that, after similar adjustment, com-
pared to non-exposure, both high density (childhood SHS
exposure ≥2 smokers in the same household) and high fre-
quency of exposure (≥5 times/week) were associated with a
higher risk of frequent pregnancy loss (≥2 times vs 0–1 time)
(OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.57, and 1.20, 95% CI 1.03 to
1.40, respectively).
Sensitivity analysis using pregnancy loss ≥3times as the defin-
ition of frequent pregnancy loss showed similar results for fre-
quency ≥5 times/week (adjusted OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.00 to
1.71; table 3).
DISCUSSION
Based on GBCS baseline data, we have shown that never
smoking women exposed to SHS during childhood, particularly
with higher density (greater number of smokers) and frequency,
were associated with higher risks of pregnancy loss in adult-
hood. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
showing the association in Asians. The major strength of our
study was the comprehensive control and adjustment of a wide
range of potential confounders using different statistical models.
The similar results demonstrated the robustness of the results.
Moreover, since childhood SHS exposure undoubtedly occurred
before pregnancy loss, the problem of reverse causality, one of
the major limitations in cross-sectional studies, should not be a
major concern in our study.
Several previous studies showed that maternal SHS exposure
in adulthood was associated with pregnancy loss,6–8 but only a
few examined the association between childhood SHS exposure
and pregnancy loss.10–12 Meeker et al12 recruited 2162 non-
smoking women from couples undergoing in vitro fertilisation
or
intra
cytoplasmic
sperm
injection
in
three
Boston,
Massachusetts area clinics from August 1994 to June 2003 and
found that women who reported having two parents who
smoked
during
their
childhood
were
associated
with
an
increased risk of spontaneous abortion compared to those
without such exposure (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.0 to 3.0).However,
information of SHS exposure frequency was not reported.
Peppone et al showed that in women who visited a cancer hos-
pital, SHS exposure both at home during childhood and at the
time of the survey was associated with fetal loss (OR 1.39, 95%
CI 1.17 to 1.66). However, the association of childhood SHS
exposure with fetal loss was not statistically significant, probably
because of the relatively small sample size (n=4794).11 Hyland
et al10 analysed historical reproductive data of 80 762 women
from the W
omen’s Health Initiative Observational Study in the
USA and showed that in never-smoking women, compared to
those without SHS exposure, those with the highest levels of
lifetime
SHS
exposure,
defined
as
childhood
exposure
>10 years, adulthood home exposure >20 years and/or adult-
hood work exposure >10 years, had a higher risk of spontan-
eous abortion (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.30). However, the

 authors did not distinguish childhood SHS exposure from adult-
hood SHS exposure. Thus, our results are consistent with the
studies above and have provided new evidence supporting a
positive association between childhood SHS exposure and the
risk of pregnancy loss.
The mechanistic pathway of how childhood SHS exposure
may lead to pregnancy loss is still unclear. However, earlier
evidence has shown the toxic effects of active smoking on preg-
nancy and fertility.26 27 In vitro studies have reviewed the mech-
anistic pathways including the effects of active smoke exposure
on uterine micro vasculature, cytotrophoblast invasion, mitotic
activity, differentiation and attachment during placental develop-
ment and on embryonic development.28 In vivo studies also sug-
gested that tobacco compounds exert a deleterious effect on the

 process of ovarian follicle maturation.29 Furthermore, some pre-
vious studies showed that SHS might alter endocrine and men-
strual function in women.30 31 Maternal smoking exposure was
associated with retarded embryo growth in the uterus.32 Since
childhood is the critical development stage of all tissues, organs
and systems, and children’s lungs and immune system are imma-
ture, they are vulnerable to the adverse effects of SHS exposure
and may subsequently suffer from adverse health outcomes in
adulthood including pregnancy loss.
This study had several limitations. Since the information on
exposure and pregnancy loss was based on recall, random error
could not be fully ruled out, which may lead to a bias towards
null. Although differential reporting of exposure was possible,
the reliability of the questionnaire was tested in 200 participants
with κ values of 0.88 and 0.96 for the two questions about
smoking status, respectively.17 33 Second, our sample may not
be completely representative of the general older populations in
southern China. However, within sex and age group, the partici-
pants had a fairly similar prevalence of chronic diseases such as
diabetes and hypertension to nationally representative samples
of urban Chinese.17 The representativeness of our sample
should not affect the internal validity substantially in the present
study. The third limitation is the lack of information on the
sources of childhood SHS exposure. However, since very few
women smoke (<2%) in China,16 most of the childhood SHS
exposure was from paternal smoking. Fourth, we did not have
information to assess the association of genetic abnormality
with pregnancy loss. However, since chromosomal abnormality
was unlikely to influence childhood SHS exposure, it could not
be a confounder of the association between childhood SHS
exposure and times of pregnancy loss. Fifth, we did not collect
any information on ventilation system of the respondents’
houses. However, since all participants in our study were aged
50 years or above and were born before 1953, the ventilation
systems of the houses where they lived in childhood (ie, before
1971) were almost the same at that time in China. Thus, it is
unlikely to confound the results. Sixth, since information on age
of (first) pregnancy loss was not available in this study, the asso-
ciation of childhood SHS exposure in childhood with age of
(first) pregnancy loss could not be examined. W
e can add ques-
tions about the age of pregnancy loss in further follow-up inter-
views. Finally, we cannot examine the association of SHS
exposure at different periods of the life course and stages of
pregnancy with pregnancy loss of our participants because of
the lack of detailed information on participants’ SHS exposure
during each of their pregnancies.
In conclusion, our study showed that childhood SHS expos-
ure was associated with higher risks of pregnancy loss. Given
that the participants’ SHS exposure reflects the societal smoking
prevalence from ∼50 years ago, when cigarette smoking was
much less popular than today (note that annual sales of cigar-
ettes in China increased from 80 billion in 1952 to 2375.2
billion in 2010),34 a high level of exposure in China in recent
years is expected, which would lead to a substantially higher
healthcare burden related to pregnancy loss, if a causal relation-
ship can be established. Our findings support the enactment of
stringent national smoke-free laws and strict enforcement in
China, and promotion of smoke-free homes to protect children,
as well as the need for campaigns to change social norms of
smoking and passive smoking.
What this paper adds
Evidence from population-based studies on childhood
secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure and pregnancy loss in
adulthood is limited. We examined and found the association of
childhood SHS exposure with pregnancy loss in the Guangzhou
Biobank Cohort Study (GBCS), the largest population-based
cohort study of middle-aged and older Chinese people in
southern China.
