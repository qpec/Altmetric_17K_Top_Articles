The ability to perceive geomagnetic fields (GMFs) represents a fasci-
nating biological phenomenon. Studies on transgenic flies have pro-
vided evidence that photosensitive Cryptochromes (Cry) are involved
in the response to magnetic fields (MFs). However, none of the studies
tackled the problem of whether the Cry-dependent magnetosensitiv-
ity is coupled to the sole MF presence or to the direction of MF vector.
In this study, we used gene silencing and a directional MF to show that
mammalian-like Cry2 is necessary for a genuine directional response to
periodic rotations of the GMF vector in two insect species. Longer
wavelengths of light required higher photon fluxes for a detectable
behavioral response, and a sharp detection border was present in
the cyan/green spectral region. Both observations are consistent with
involvement of the FADox, FAD•− and FADH– redox forms of flavin.
The response was lost upon covering the eyes, demonstrating that the
signal is perceived in the eye region. Immunohistochemical staining
detected Cry2 in the hemispherical layer of laminal glia cells under-
neath the retina. Together, these findings identified the eye-localized
Cry2 as an indispensable component and a likely photoreceptor of the
directional GMF response. Our study is thus a clear step forward in
deciphering the in vivo effects of GMF and supports the interaction of
underlying mechanism with the visual system.

ehavioral evidence for sensitivity to geomagnetic fields
(GMFs) has been found in numerous vertebrate and in-
vertebrate taxa (1); however, the underlying mechanisms remain a
biological and biophysical enigma. In the late 1970s, the effect of
light on the orientation of birds inspired Schulten and colleagues (2)
to suggest that reactions of radical pairs (RPs) formed by photo-
sensitive biological processes may be susceptive to external mag-
netic fields (MFs), and thus provide the basis for in vivo chemical
magnetoreception. Since then, ample studies have supported this
hypothesis (reviewed, e.g., in refs. 3 and 4).
In the past decade, proteins from the Cryptochrome/Photolyase
family (CPF) have been widely discussed as being relevant to the
light-dependent biological compass relying on the RP mechanism (5–
7). Plant Crys mediate sensitivity to blue ∕ UVA light (8), and this
sensitivity was reported to be influenced by a MF (9), although later
verification failed (10). Crys are essential for circadian clock function
in mammals, but are likely not directly involved in light reception
(11). In the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, Cry mediates the light
entrainment of the circadian clock (12). Both fly circadian rhythmicity
and geotaxis turned out to be Cry-dependent and were also affected
by a MF (13–15). Curiously, some insect species have only a Dro-
sophila-type of Cry (Cry1 or animal type I Cry), whereas others have a
mammalian-type of Cry (Cry2 or animal type II Cry) or both (16).
The validity of the RP mechanism was proven in the carotenoid–
porphyrin–fullerene triad (17). In CPF proteins, the change in redox
state of their flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor can result
in magnetosensitive RPs (18). Although the RPs studied in two CPF
proteins were magnetosensitive (19, 20), RP-based GMF effects and
anisotropic MF effects have not been shown in CPF proteins. In
contrast, ultrafast GMF effects on transient FAD fluorescence in an
apparently purified Cry from birds was reported in a recent study
(21), suggesting the existence of a GMF-sensitive reaction that dif-
fers from spin-selective RP recombination.
The biological output of the RP–GMF interaction might hypo-
thetically be generated when a particular redox status of a FAD
cofactor is reached, changing the configuration of the Cry protein
(22) or its C terminus, which switches the Cry to a signaling state (23).
Concerning possible downstream effects, Cry activation was shown to
control permeability of potassium channels in Drosophila (24).
In terms of Cry-mediated in vivo chemical magnetoreception
in general, an organism’s sensitivity to the presence of GMF
should be considered separate from its sensitivity to the GMF’s
orientation (25). Although the sole detection of the presence or
intensity of a GMF can be accomplished in vitro via a disordered
RP system (17), a number of additional critical requirements
should be met to function as a sensor of magnetic direction, from
the anisotropy of electron–nucleus interactions to the anatomy
of a sensory organ (see Discussion).
Significance
The photosensitive protein Cryptochrome (Cry) is involved in the
detection of magnetic fields (MFs) in Drosophila. However, Cry-
dependent responses to natural MF intensities and to the di-
rection of the MF vector have not been demonstrated previously
in any insect. Birds, monarch butterflies, and many other species
perceive the direction of geomagnetic field (GMF) lines, but the
involvement of Cry has not been rigorously proven using genetic
tools. In this study, by combining behavioral and genetic ap-
proaches, we provide the first unambiguous evidence to our
knowledge of a Cry-dependent sensitivity to the direction of
GMF in two cockroach species. Furthermore, by eye-covering
experiments and by immunolocalization of a crucial mammalian-
type Cry2 under the retina, we clearly show that the eye is an
indispensable organ for the directional GMF response.

 The most convincing evidence of Cry-dependent magneto-
sensitivity was provided on Drosophila (26, 27). The ability to
recognize the presence of a MF relies on functional Cry1, and
this magnetoreception in Cry-deficient fruit fly mutants could be
rescued using mammalian-like Cry2 (28). The flies were trained
to recognize the local magnetic anomaly up to 10 times stronger
than the natural GMF in T-shape maze experiments. Although
the choice of one of two arms involved orientation, the actual
physiological effect was consistent with nondirectional magnetic
sensitivity (29), as was discussed for plants (9, 10), fruit fly geo-
taxis (14), and the fruit fly circadian clock (13, 15). Therefore,
rather than demonstrating a genuine directional sensor serving
as a GMF compass, these studies proved that Cry mediated
detection of a rather intense, artificial magnetic anomaly.
Here, we have taken advantage of an assay enabling us to test
directional magnetic sensitivity in insects at naturally occurring
GMF intensities (30) and functionally confirmed that mammalian-
like Cry2 is necessary for sensing the directional component of
MFs of natural intensities by two different species of cockroaches.
Results
Previously we developed an assay enabling us to test directional
magnetic sensitivity in insects at natural GMF intensity (30) (Fig.
1 A and B) in a nonconditioned, spontaneous behavioral reaction
to slow shifts of the magnetic North position. We first used the
American cockroach, Periplaneta americana, but soon realized
that this species most likely contains only Cry2. Thus, we added
another cockroach species, Blattella germanica, which has both
Cry types (see SI Appendix, Fig. S1 for phylogenetic analysis and
SI Appendix, Fig. S2 for details on Cry1 search in P. americana).

producing any external MF. The red lines indicate the mean values of all animals

PHYSIOLOGY
 During their resting time around noon, cockroaches display
minimal locomotor activity (Fig. 2B). However, when the di-
rection of the horizontal magnetic vector of the natural GMF is
rotated periodically (Fig. 1 A and B), the animals change their
resting positions more frequently. We term this phenomenon
magnetically induced restlessness (MIR) (Fig. 1C). As a control,
a double-wrapped coil that does not generate any MF had no
effect on MIR in any of these two species (Fig. 1C).
Cry2 Is Necessary for Directional Sensitivity. The fact that no MIR
was observed in complete darkness (DD; Fig. 2A, Right) supports the
involvement of photosensitive processes in P. americana magneto-
reception. To test the causal involvement of Cry2 in cockroach di-
rectional magnetoreception, we used our behavioral assay under 365
nm UV light in combination with a reverse genetic approach. In-
jections of double-stranded (ds) cry2 RNA (RNAi) significantly re-
duced the cry2 mRNA and protein levels (SI Appendix, Figs. S5 and
S8) and completely abolished MIR behavior (Fig. 2D). Control in-
jections of the nonspecific dsRNA or buffer alone (Fig. 2 B and C)
had no effect on the response to changes of the MF vector. Im-
portantly, the assays were conducted during the middle of the
photophase, when a drop of activity was observed in all treatment
groups. This indicated that the MIR was not an artifact caused by
endogenous activity patterns of the cockroaches (Fig. 2 B–E, Mid-
dle). The silencing of Cry2 was also accompanied by severe disrup-
tion of circadian rhythmicity in constant dark conditions (Fig. 2D,
Right and SI Appendix, Table S1) compared with control animals
(Fig. 2 B and C). The overlap of the circadian clock mechanism and
magnetic sensing was further tested under constant light conditions
known to interfere with proper clock function. As expected, the
constant light regime resulted in arrhythmic circadian behavior, but
the sensitivity of the animals to the changes in the MF direction was
unaffected (Fig. 2A, Left). In addition, injection of dsRNA targeting
the clock gene timeless had no effect on MIR, but did abolish
cockroach circadian rhythmicity (Fig. 2E and SI Appendix, Table
S1). These results clearly support the separation of GMF sensing
from the circadian clock.
The following experiments confirmed that the locomotor activity
in photophase is lower after any treatment in the second cockroach
species, B. germanica (Fig. 3 A–E, Middle). Although control dsRNA
or buffer injection had no effect on MIR and circadian phenotypes
in DD (Fig. 3 A and B), cry2 knockdown abolished MIR and re-
duced circadian rhythmicity (Fig. 3C). Remarkably, cry1 reduction
did not affect MIR, whereas circadian rhythmicity was reduced even
more than in cry2 RNAi animals, indicating that cry1 RNAi was
efficient (Fig. 3D and SI Appendix, Fig. S5). Notably, cry1 knock-
down resulted in significant up-regulation of cry2 levels (SI Appendix,
Fig. S5); nevertheless, the detailed mechanism, how cry1 depletion
affects behavioral rhythmicity, is beyond the scope of this study.
Consistently, cry1+cry2 double RNAi abolished MIR and reduced
circadian rhythmicity (Fig. 3E). Cry2 therefore represents a pre-
requisite for magnetic susceptibility in both cockroach species.
Magnetoreception Is Dependent on Light from UV to Cyan/Green 505 nm.
To further characterize magnetoreception, we tested seven wave-
lengths of light under different intensities (SI Appendix, Table S7).
The minimal light intensity needed for MIR was at UVA 365 nm.
The sensitivity of the MIR gradually dropped to 4 × 1016
photons m−2·s−1 under two blue light wavelengths, followed by a
local boost of sensitivity at 505 nm. Under 505 nm, the MIR was
still significant under dim light (7 × 1015 photons mm−2·s−1), but
the MIR response dropped precipitously at higher wavelengths;
no MIR was observed at 528 nm, even with 1,000× stronger light
(6 × 1018 photons m−2·s−1; Fig. 4A). Enlarged samples were
tested to exclude possible errors (SI Appendix, Table S7), but
the steep threshold of MIR sensitivity was upheld. There was
also a negative result at 407 nm light and its maximal intensity
2 × 1017 photons m−2·s−1, likely showing the upper border of a func-
tional window shown previously [e.g., from experiments on birds (31)].
Magnetoreceptor Is Most Likely Located in the Compound Eyes. Be-
cause light is necessary for magnetoreception (Fig. 2A), we
attempted to localize the magnetoreceptive organ anatomically by
shielding/painting the compound eyes. The animals with compound

 eyes covered by transparent enamel retained MIR, whereas black
enamel prevented any magnetoreceptive response, suggesting eyes
as the necessary organ for magnetoreception (Fig. 5A).
Laser-scanning confocal microscopy localized Cry2 to a hemi-
spherical multicellular structure immediately beneath the cockroach
retina (Fig. 5 B and C). Colocalization of Cry2 with antisera raised
against the alpha subunit of Na/K-ATPase (32) (SI Appendix, Fig.
S10 A–C) resulted in a pattern similar in structure to Drosophila
epithelial glial cells (33, 34), suggesting these cells are glia localized
underneath the retina between the two basement membranes (35).
Higher magnification revealed an orderly columnar alignment of
the Cry2-positive cells (Fig. 5 and SI Appendix, Fig. S9), with the
strongest signal localized in the close vicinity of the plasma mem-
brane (SI Appendix, Fig. S10).
Discussion
Cry Phylogeny in Blattodea. In this study, we explored the role of
Crys in magnetoreception, using two cockroach species. Cry1 was
not found in P. americana by examination of its assembled tran-
scriptome, or in raw RNA reads even when Cry2 coding sequences
or Cry unrelated genes were identified (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Be-
cause the Cry protein structure is remarkably well conserved, we
suggest that Cry1 is absent in P. americana. This hypothesis is fur-
ther supported by phylogenetic analysis of insect Crys, where Cry1
was not identified either in cockroach Cryptocercus or in two termite
species, suggesting the loss of Cry1 in multiple species of the
Blattodea lineage. Therefore, the most plausible explanation is the
existence of different Cry genes in B. germanica and P. americana.
Detection of Directional Changes of MF in Cockroaches. Even though
the MIR assay does not monitor directional locomotion from point
A to point B, which might be expected if compass abilities are in-
vestigated (e.g., in migratory birds), it gives unequivocal evidence of
sensitivity to the direction of the magnetic vector. The simplicity of
the behavioral output is a particular strength of this assay compared
with orientation tests made on birds, where unimodal versus axial
orientation under different light conditions are results that should
be considered separately (36). Another merit of our unconditioned
assay is its relative insensitivity to changes in motivation under
different light regimens, which may alter more complex behavioral
programs such as migration behavior.
Spectral Effects and Magnetic Signaling. The dependence of mag-
netoreception on specific wavelengths and intensities of light has
been documented extensively in birds (summarized in refs. 31, 36,
37). The FAD cofactor of CPF proteins is capable of both ground-
state (dark) and light-driven redox reactions. One-electron re-
duction of neutral fully oxidized state (FADox) and one-electron
oxidation of anionic fully reduced state (FADH−) produce anionic
semiquinone (FAD•−) and neutral semiquinone (FADH•) radicals,
respectively, that are capable of magnetosensitive spin-correlated
RPs (18) (SI Appendix, Fig. S11). The most frequently discussed
model supposes spin-correlated RPs consisting of FAD•− and a
cationic radical of Trp or Tyr initiated by the UVA/blue light ex-
citation of FADox (SI Appendix, Fig. S11, Scheme 1). MF modulates
interconversion of the singlet and triplet states of RP, hence
changing the proportions of two competing pathways yielding dif-
ferent reaction products (5).
FAD changes its spectral absorption properties as it goes through
several redox states, during its redox cycle (38) (SI Appendix, Fig.
S12). Examination of spectral limits during in vivo magnetoreception
may help clarify which redox forms of FAD and which radical part-
ners participate in the signaling conformation of Cry proteins (39).
Our MIR spectrum for Blattella (Fig. 4) shows a steep decline of
sensitivity in the cyan region 505–528 nm, remarkably matching the
decline of light absorption of three redox forms of flavin: FADOX,
FADH− and FAD•− (40) (SI Appendix, Fig. S11). Such a coincidence
points to possible involvement of flavin in cockroach magneto-
reception. The role of the FADH• redox form, which absorbs in wide
spectrum including wavelengths above cyan (SI Appendix, Fig. S10), is
not clear. The MIR spectrum (Fig. 4), however, does not fully con-
form to a direct light absorption by FADox (SI Appendix, Fig. S11).
Although two peaks of magnetosensitivity of Blattella at UV 365 and
green/cyan 505 nm are apparent, the absorbance of FADox peaks at
about 450 nm. As a possible explanation, an indirect FADox excita-
tion via energy transfer from a UVA-absorbing antenna cofactor may
occur. Such a cofactor (e.g., methenyltetrahydrofolate) is well-known
for many CPF proteins, and was discussed also for Drosophila Cry
(41). Because both wavelength peaks of MIR response exactly match
the peaks of visual sensitivity of Periplaneta (42) and Blattella (43),
they might reflect a generally close association between magneto-
reception and vision.
The drop in MIR sensitivity is surprisingly sharp in the wave-
length range between 505 and 528 nm, where magnetoreception is
lost even under exposure to three orders magnitude of light in-
tensity (Fig. 4 and SI Appendix, Table S7). Such a sharp cutoff
cannot easily be attributed to the spectral sensitivity limit of a single
crucial photopigment. As Wiltschko et al. (44) state from a com-
parable phenomenon in birds: “It rather seems to reflect some

 antagonistic interactions with receptor activated by longer wave-
length light.” As short and long wavelengths may have opposite ef-
fects on the relative concentration of FADOX versus semiquinone
FADH• redox states, changes in illumination color can also result in
antagonistic changes of cryptochrome activation (36). If wavelengths
from UV to blue stimulate MIR while green light 528 nm suppresses
it, then the semiquinone FADH• (or other still-unknown pigment)
could be considered an antagonistic candidate in our MIR assay.
Reports of light-dependent magnetoreception beyond 528 nm
are not unique within behavioral reports on birds (green/yellow)
(45). However, the finding that preexposure of European robins
to white light not earlier than 30 min before testing is necessary
for proper orientation suggests a dependence on the short-
wavelength part of spectra as well (39), meaning that orientation
under green/yellow light is only a transient phenomenon (45).
A contrasting situation was reported in the fruit fly
(D. melanogaster) and monarch butterfly (Dannaus plexippus),
which lost magnetic compass orientation if the illumination
wavelength was already above 420 nm, which is still well within
the absorption range of FADOX (26, 27, 46). Because the studies
did not seek thresholds for separate colors, the question remains
whether the diurnal species such as Dannaus or Drosophila had
already reached the absolute threshold of their sensitivity to light-
driven magnetoreception. Blattella lost its magnetoreception under
only 10-fold dimmer light than Dannaus or Drosophila. Provided
they have denser cuticle or eye pigment shielding than night-active
Blattella, brighter illumination might induce magnetoreception even
for green and longer wavelengths. The inconsistencies among
Blattella, Drosophila, Dannaus, and birds show that taxa-specific
Crys may use different redox cycles and that the analysis of the
long-wavelength tail of the light spectrum may be of particular in-
terest to identify other yet-uncharacterized signaling partners. In
summary, our behavioral data on the spectral dependence of Cry2-
dependent insect magnetoreception are consistent with the in-
volvement of electron transfer reactions of FADox, FADH−,
and FAD•−.
Directional Sensitivity. Local magnetic conditions that possibly
control RP reactivity are a result of interplay between external
MFs, nuclear spins of RP partners (47, 48), and electron spins of
nearby radicals (49). To function as a directional sensor that
changes the product yield solely after a shift in the magnetic
vector, the RPs must respond anisotropically (2, 50). So far, there
has been no demonstration that any Cry radical reaction responds
to an Earth-strength MF, or that this response is anisotropic, as
would be required for a magnetic compass (18).
Another important condition is that sensory molecules should
optimally be aligned in the same direction within the receptor
cells, in order that the stochastic effects of freely rotating molecules
would be eliminated (51). Such a condition could be met by cyto-
skeletal anchoring to the membrane, or by at least partial immobi-
lization within the cells (52).
Moreover, for sufficiently fast compass orientation, the magnetic
direction-sensitive structure should ideally consist of spatially or-
ganized receptor cells, so that the signal from differentially activated
cells can be compared, and the GMF vector can be directly iden-
tified. As suggested (48), the retina forms an ideal hemispherical
organ for photoreception, with a potential for directional magne-
toreception. If the Cry reaction products are involved in the visual
signaling pathway, they could modulate the rate of light trans-
duction to a neural signal (5).
Our behavioral–genetic evidence provides a link between truly
directional magnetic sensitivity and mammalian Cry protein,
supporting the so-far-hypothetical predictions of directional
magnetic sensitivity discussed earlier.
Anatomical Localization of the Magnetoreceptor. The experiment
with painted eyes suggested that the magnetoreceptive tissue is
localized either within the compound eye or underneath it (Fig. 5A).
Cry2-immunoreactive cells were localized immediately beneath the
pigmented layer of the cockroach retina in a hemispherical multi-
cellular structure (Fig. 5B). The cells were spread between the two
basement membranes (Fig. 5C) separating the retina from the
fenestrated layer of lamina neuropil (35). High-magnification
analysis identified Cry staining strongest in the close vicinity of the
plasma membrane (SI Appendix, Fig. S10). Indeed, association of
Cry with the scaffolding protein close to the membrane was
reported recently for Drosophila (53). Such immobilization would
further support Cry as a directional magnetoreceptor, as discussed
earlier. Furthermore, microinjection of a fluorescent neuronal
tracer into the cockroach ocular photoreceptor cells revealed an
intimate contact between the neuronal output from the retina
and the Cry2-positive cells (SI Appendix, Fig. S9), suggesting
their possible interplay.
Taken together, the results of our study establish the role of a
mammalian-type Cry in light-dependent magnetoreception in two
insect species phylogenetically distant to Drosophila. More impor-
tant, our study delivers original evidence that the Cry2 protein is
involved in the detection of GMF vector direction at natural in-
tensities, which is a crucial feature of a biological receptor providing
genuine compass bearings; by means of immunolocalization, we
identified the eye and subretinal region as a likely site of magne-
toreception in insects; and we show that spectral dependency of
mammalian Cry-linked magnetoreception is in line with in-
volvement of flavins. Altogether, the work provides original genetic
proof of the previously hypothesized chemical reactions that may
underlie a functional compass in animals.
Materials and Methods
Behavioral Tests: MIR. Cold-immobilized cockroaches, regardless of sex, were
transferred individually into glass Petri dishes with white opaque walls and
placed into a white arena with a translucent lid. On the next day, a camera–PC
system underneath a glass pane holding the dishes sampled the silhouettes
of the animals illuminated from above every 1 min. Frames taken between
10:00 and 14:30 were downloaded and divided into six 45-min intervals: the
first two (1, 2; 10:00–11:30) before magnetic North rotation, the middle
three intervals (3–5; 11:30–13:45) when the field was periodically rotated,
and the last interval (6; 13:45–14:30) after this magnetic treatment. The
temperature varied between 21 °C and 24 °C in the testing room.
Photic Conditions. A set of three UV LEDs 365 nm (Nichia NCSU033A) illuminated
the arena through a translucent lid that diffused light so that its intensity
was 4.04 × 1016 quanta m−2·s−1 in the center of the arena and 3.12 × 1016
quanta m−2·s−1 along the wall line (radiometer International Light IL700,
SHD 033 probe). Types and spectral characteristics of all LEDs used are given in
SI Appendix, Fig. S6 and Table S7.
Magnetic Conditions. The natural geomagnetic background within the testing
space was as follows: horizontal component 18 μT, total vector 45 μT, and
inclination 66°. The spatial variation in the arena region was <2% (measured
by HMR 2300 magnetometer; Honeywell). During periods of magnetic North
rotations (periods 3–5), only the horizontal component of local GMF was
rotated by 60° by means of a horizontal four-element double-wrapped
Merritt coil, making an angle with the N–S axis of 120° (SI Appendix, Fig. S3).
Evaluation and Statistics. For both MIR and circadian activity, the number of body
axis changes >15° was determined visually using Screen Protractor software
(Iconico.com Software) for Periplaneta. In the case of Blattella, MIR recordings
were done automatically with image analysis software RoachLab. In both cases,
the personnel scoring the activity and doing the statistical analysis were not aware
of which set of images they were evaluating. For MIR analysis, the activity of every
animal was given as a pair of numbers: activity in steady field − sf (control periods
1 + 2 + 6) versus activity in rotated field − rf (treated periods 3 + 4 + 5). The
experiment was principally designed as “paired,” where individual animals rep-
resented objects producing mutually consecutive outcomes from measurement
periods. In such a design, the outcomes must be compared on the basis of paired
statistical tests, which can then adjust the internal correlation (individuality) of
primary data. Because of the pair design of the test, we did not compare statis-
tically groups among each other.

 Antibodies and Immunodetection. The synthetic peptide CHSPSYRENIKSGIHFHR
corresponding to the C-terminal region of the Periplaneta Cry2 was used to
generate a custom-made specific antibody (Moravian Biotech). Cry2 pri-
mary antibody was used at a dilution of 1:1,000 or 1:1,500, with similar
results. Immunofluorescent detection and microinjection of Alexa Fluor-
conjugated dextran neuronal tracer were carried out as described earlier
(54). The alpha5 mouse monoclonal antibody (DSHB Hybridoma Product
a5; SI Appendix, Fig. S10) was used at a dilution of 1:50, as described in
refs. 32 and 34.
Verification of RNAi Efficiency. cry2, cry1, timeless, or lacZ dsRNA was injected,
and the cockroaches were euthanized 14 d later. Their brains were dissected
and used for RNA isolation and subsequent quantitative RT-PCR analysis (SI
Appendix, Fig. S5). Alternatively, dissected brains were surgically divided into
two hemispheres, including the optic lobes and eyes. One hemisphere was used
for RNA isolation and subsequent qRT-PCR analysis (SI Appendix, Fig. S8B). The
second hemisphere was fixed and used for immunocytochemistry (SI Appendix,
Fig. S8 A and C–F). In this case, both control (lacZ RNAi) and cry2 RNAi brain
sections were processed on the same microscope slide. The analysis was per-
formed double blind, and the reduction of protein was evaluated by Image J
analysis software (SI Appendix, Fig. S1E).
