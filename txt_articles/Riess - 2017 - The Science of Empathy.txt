The Science of Empathy
Helen Riess, MD1
Abstract
Empathy plays a critical interpersonal and societal role, enabling sharing of experiences, needs, and desires between individuals
and providing an emotional bridge that promotes pro-social behavior. This capacity requires an exquisite interplay of neural
networks and enables us to perceive the emotions of others, resonate with them emotionally and cognitively, to take in the
perspective of others, and to distinguish between our own and others’ emotions. Studies show empathy declines during
medical training. Without targeted interventions, uncompassionate care and treatment devoid of empathy, results in patients
who are dissatisfied. They are then much less likely to follow through with treatment recommendations, resulting in poorer
health outcomes and damaged trust in health providers. Cognitive empathy must play a role when a lack of emotional empathy
exists because of racial, ethnic, religious, or physical differences. Healthcare settings are no exception to conscious and
unconscious biases, and there is no place for discrimination or unequal care afforded to patients who differ from the majority
culture or the majority culture of healthcare providers. Much work lies ahead to make healthcare equitable for givers
and receivers of healthcare from all cultures. Self- and other-empathy leads to replenishment and renewal of a vital human
capacity. If we are to move in the direction of a more empathic society and a more compassionate world, it is clear that
working to enhance our native capacities to empathize is critical to strengthening individual, community, national, and
international bonds.

Introduction
Empathy plays a critical interpersonal and societal role,
enabling sharing of experiences, needs, and desires between
individuals and providing an emotional bridge that promotes
prosocial behavior. This capacity requires an exquisite inter-
play of neural networks and enables us to perceive the emo-
tions of others, resonate with them emotionally and
cognitively, to take in the perspective of others, and to dis-
tinguish between our own and others’ emotions.
Studies have shown that empathy declines during med-
ical training (1,2) and without targeted interventions,
uncompassionate care and treatment devoid of empathy
results in dissatisfied patients who are unlikely to follow
through with treatment recommendations, resulting in
poorer health outcomes and damaged trust in health provi-
der relationships.
In the past, empathy was considered an inborn trait that
could not be taught, but research has shown that this vital
human competency is mutable and can be taught to health-
care providers. The evidence for patient-rated empathy
improvement in physicians has been demonstrated in pilot
and retention studies (3,4) and a randomized controlled trial
(5). Further evidence that communication skills training for
physicians improves patient satisfaction scores was reported
in a large-scale observational study (6). Empathic medical
care is associated with many benefits including improved
patient experiences, adherence to treatment recommenda-
tions, better clinical outcomes, fewer medical errors and
malpractice claims, and higher physician retention (5).
Why is the human brain designed for this complex, intri-
cate task? If human existence was simply the result of
“survival of the fittest,” we would be wired solely to

 dominate others, not to respond to their suffering. Our capac-
ity to perceive and resonate with others’ suffering allows us
to feel and understand their pain. The personal distress
experienced by observing others’ pain often motivates us
to respond with compassion. The survival of our species
depends on mutual aid, and providing it reduces our own
distress. Mutual aid exists in the earliest reports of tribal
behavior and remains a powerful force in today’s world,
where thousands of organizations and millions of people
work to relieve global suffering (7).
The concept of empathy was first introduced by aesthe-
ticians in the mid-19th century. They used the German word
“Einfu
¨hlung” to describe the emotional “knowing” of a work
of art from within, by feeling an emotional resonance with
the work of art. At the end of the 19th century, the psychol-
ogist Theodore Lipps expanded this concept to mean
“feeling one’s way into the experience of another” by theo-
rizing that inner imitation of the actions of others played a
critical role in eliciting empathy. The philosopher Martin
Buber added deeper texture to the concept of empathy by
describing the empathic relationship as “I and Thou,” versus
unempathic disrespect, as “I and It” (8). In this powerful
description, humane respect and concern for the other is
contrasted with objectification and dehumanization of
another person, which is in evidence too often in today’s
societies.
Empathy is a Hardwired Capacity
Research in the neurobiolgy of empathy has changed the
perception of empathy from a soft skill to a neurobiologi-
cally based competency (9). The theory of inner imitation
of the actions of others in the observer has been supported
by brain research. Functional magnetic resonance imaging
now demonstrates the existence of a neural relay mechan-
ism that allows empathic individuals to exhibit unconscious
mimicry of the postures, mannerisms, and facial expres-
sions of others to a greater degree than individuals who are
unempathic (10). Patients unconsciously mimic the actions
and facial expressions of others through brain mechanisms
that mirror the actions of others by stimulating the same
motor and sensory areas in the observers’ brains as the
person they are observing. This mirroring capacity has been
demonstrated at the level of single muscle fibers. If a per-
son’s hand muscle is pricked by a fine needle, for example,
the same motor and sensory areas are activated in the brain
of an observer (11).
Studies also demonstrate that while patients are either
imitating or simply observing emotional facial expressions,
activation of a similar network of brain areas occurs in the
observer. Within this network, there is activity during simple
observation of emotional faces, and greater activity during
imitation of emotions (12). In addition to inner representa-
tions of others’ facial displays, shared neural circuits have
also been demonstrated for tone of voice, touch, disgust, and
pain. Researchers conclude from these studies that observers
feel what others feel to an attenuated degree. This is
achieved through a mechanism of neural action representa-
tion that often modulates observers’ own emotional content
and motivates empathic responses. Differences in these
neural processes may account for different individual capa-
cities for empathy (13).
A novel study showed that the expression, “I feel your
pain,” is much more than just a figure of speech. Sixteen
female volunteers had brain scans performed while they
received painful electric shocks to their hands. While they
received the shock, a well-defined “pain matrix” was
activated in their brains. Afterward, they received a signal
that their spouses were receiving similar shocks. This
activated a similar (but not entire) pain matrix in the
females’ brains.
This is the first neuroimaging study to demonstrate that
we actually do feel the pain of others, but only in an attenu-
ated form (10). Attenuation makes it possible to empathize
but not become overwhelmed with another’s personal
distress. Our own distress would likely render us less helpful.
Indeed, there is a balance between empathy leading to help-
ing or distancing behaviors due to personal distress. An
important balance must be struck by ensuring that health-
care providers receive enough care, support, and empathy
from their institutions in order to provide high-quality
empathic care and to benefit from the positive side effects
of empathy (14).
Empathy, Medicine, and Society
A cardinal feature of empathy is that it usually helps connect
people to others. Because of the evolutionary development
of this brain-based capacity, affective empathy, or emotional
sharing, most easily occurs among members of the same
“tribe”. Individuals tend to have the most empathy for others
who look or act like them, for others who have suffered in a
similar way, or for those who share a common goal. We see
these biases play out repeatedly in communities, schools,
sports teams, and religious communities. The truth of the
matter is that empathy is not always an equal opportunity
benefactor (15). People are evolutionarily wired to recognize
and respond to differences and socially or culturally based
perceptions can trigger subconscious fears that threaten emo-
tional homeostasis.
All perceptions in our environment are routed through the
thalamus. From there, the amygdala, the threat sensor in the
brain, reacts to threats, unfamiliar stimuli, conditioned fears,
and perceived threats in as few as 50 milliseconds long
before conscious thoughts come into play. When these threat
signals reach the midbrain, (specifically in the area of the
pons) automatic reactions such as the fight, flight or freeze
response take place unless there is cognitive input from
executive functions in the prefrontal cortex.
Because of this evolutionary bias, cognitive empathy must
play a role when a lack of emotional empathy exists because
of racial, ethnic, religious, or physical differences. Health-

 care settings are no exception to conscious and unconscious
biases, and there is no place for discrimination or unequal
care afforded to patients who differ from the majority culture
or the majority culture of health-care providers. Much work
lies ahead to make health care equitable for givers and recei-
vers of health care from all cultures. A health-care system
that does not value its workforce and offer equal rights and
protections for all, risks attrition, systemic distress, burnout,
loss of trust in the health-care system and tarnished institu-
tional reputations. Such attitudes and consequences affect
employees, professional staff and ultimately patients, and
the extended community.
Important research on empathy and altruism has demon-
strated that enhancing perspective taking, the capacity to see
a person’s situation from his or her point of view, coupled
with enhanced value being placed on the welfare of those
who are unfamiliar can override bias. For example, Batson
and colleagues found that empathic concern is not necessa-
rily elicited by perceived similarity to others or by affective
sharing but can also be elicited by valuing the welfare of
people who appear dissimilar (16).
In an interesting study, Batson explored the relationship
of perspective-taking to valuing a person who is in need.
Perspective taking is a well-known precursor to empathic
concern. In the first experiment, both perspective taking and
valuing were variables and each increased empathic concern
independently. In second experiment, valuing the person
in need was the only independent variable. Interestingly,
increases in valuing the other person increased perspective
taking and also increased empathic concern which, in turn,
increased helping. We can conclude from these experiments
that valuing a person in need is an important, and largely
overlooked, variable and precursor of feeling empathy for
that person (16).
Empathy is a factor that draws individuals to helping pro-
fessions and plays a critical role in understanding the nuances
of others’ experiences. Empathy is a complex capability
enabling individuals to understand and feel the emotional
states of others, resulting in compassionate behavior. Empathy
requires cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and moral capaci-
ties to understand and respond to the suffering of others.
Compassion is a tender response to the perception of another’s
suffering. Compassion cannot exist without empathy, as they
are part of the same perception and response continuum that
moves human beings from observation to action.
Self-empathy is a much neglected area and is necessary to
ensure that health-care workers have the necessary resources
to remain empathic toward others. Human beings have intri-
cate, shared neural circuits in motor, sensory, and emotional
(limbic) areas of the brain to help them understand the expe-
rience of others, leading to helping behaviors. However,
when emotionally overloaded, overwhelmed, exploited, or
burned out, the capacity for empathy declines as a result of
the degree of emotional labor expended. It is critical that as
medical professionals and caregivers that we exercise self-
care to maintain healthy levels of empathy.
Plato’s ancient question, “Can virtue be taught?” is one to
consider at our present day juncture in health care. When
newly minted doctors take the Hippocratic Oath on gradua-
tion day, they swear to provide ethical and compassionate
care for their patients. What can be done to ensure they will
keep their promise? Understanding that self-empathy is nec-
essary in order to provide empathic care to others is at the
core of wellness programs that are growing in popularity in
medical education. Enterprise wide faculty development
programs that include empathy training need to become an
institutional priority to preserve and refresh the vitality of
our health-care system.
Self-empathy and other empathy lead to replenishment
and renewal of a vital human capacity. If we are to move
in the direction of a more empathic society and a more
compassionate world, it is clear that working to enhance our
native capacities to empathize is critical to strengthening
individual, community, national, and international bonds.
As the Dali Lama so succinctly stated, “Love and compas-
sion are necessities not luxuries. Without them humanity
cannot survive” (17). Let us be the examples in health care
that the world may follow.
