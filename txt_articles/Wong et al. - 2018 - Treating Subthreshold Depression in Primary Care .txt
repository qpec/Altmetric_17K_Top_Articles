Treating Subthreshold Depression in Primary Care:  
A Randomized Controlled Trial of Behavioral Activation 
With Mindfulness
ABSTRACT
PURPOSE We undertook a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy 
of group-based behavioral activation with mindfulness (BAM) for treating sub-
threshold depression in primary care in Hong Kong.
METHODS We recruited adult patients aged 18 years or older with subthreshold 
depression from public primary care clinics and randomly assigned them to a 
BAM intervention group or a usual care group. The BAM group was provided 
with eight 2-hour weekly BAM sessions by trained allied health care workers. 
Patients in the usual care group received usual medical care with no additional 
psychological interventions. The primary outcome was depressive symptoms 
measured by the Beck Depression Inventory-II at 12 months. Secondary out-
comes included incidence of major depressive disorder at 12 months. We 
assessed quality of life, activity and circumstances change, functional impair-
ment, and anxiety at baseline, end of intervention, 5 months, and 12 months.
RESULTS We randomly allocated 115 patients to the BAM intervention and 116 
patients to usual care. At 12 months, compared with usual care peers, BAM 
patients had a slightly more favorable change in levels of depressive symp-
toms on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (between-group mean difference in 
score 
= 
–3.85; 95% CI, –6.36 to –1.34; Cohen d 
= 
–0.46, 95% CI, –0.76 to 
–0.16). Incidence of major depressive disorder was lower with BAM (10.8% vs 
26.8%, P 
= 
.01), whereas groups did not differ significantly on other secondary 
outcomes at 12 months.
CONCLUSIONS Group BAM appears to be efficacious for decreasing depressive 
symptoms and reducing the incidence of major depression among patients with 
subthreshold depression in primary care, although generalizability of our findings 
may be limited.

INTRODUCTION
T
he lifetime prevalence of subthreshold depression is estimated to be 
10% to 24%,1,2 and this condition is common in primary care set-
tings.3 Subthreshold depression can cause functional impairment4 
and considerable economic costs,5 and it is a strong risk factor for develop-
ing major depressive disorder.6
According to the quality standard for depression care in adults from 
the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, people with per-
sistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depres-
sion should receive appropriate low-intensity psychosocial interventions.7 
Behavioral activation is a brief and simple structured treatment for depres-
sion that aims to activate individuals in specific ways that will increase 
rewarding experiences in their lives.8 A series of meta-analyses concluded 
that behavioral activation was effective for treating moderate to severe 
depression,9-12 and it may be preferable in primary care settings because 
it can be delivered by health professionals with less training.13 Recently, a

large study showed that behavioral activation can be 
delivered by junior mental health workers.14 Although 
several studies have examined the effectiveness of 
behavioral activation, few have assessed its effects 
among people with subthreshold depression. Moreover, 
although the developers of behavioral activation have 
suggested and encouraged therapist use of mindful-
ness as a therapeutic method to reduce rumination in 
depressed patients,15 no large study has explicitly com-
bined behavioral activation techniques with mindful-
ness skills and evaluated their combined effectiveness 
in reducing depressive symptoms.16 Only a small pilot 
study, having 16 patients, has combined behavioral 
activation and mindfulness to improve well-being of 
adults outside health care settings.17
In Hong Kong primary care settings, 40% to 60% 
of patients are older adults who have multiple chronic 
conditions18 and are at risk of having subthreshold 
depression and developing major depression.19 Cur-
rently, there is no study in a Chinese population 
evaluating the effectiveness of group behavioral activa-
tion in the treatment of subthreshold depression. The 
aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of 
group behavioral activation with a distinct mindfulness 
component in treating subthreshold depression among 
adults in public primary care in Hong Kong.
METHODS
Patients
Patients were recruited from 16 general outpatient 
clinics in the New Territories East Cluster (8 clin-
ics), Kowloon East Cluster (6 clinics), and Kowloon 
Central Cluster (2 clinics) between September 2014 
and December 2015. The inclusion criteria were an 
age of 18 years or older, ability to speak Cantonese, 
and presence of subthreshold depression, defined as a 
score of 5 to 9 on the 9-item Patient Health Question-
naire (PHQ-9) depression scale.20-22 Exclusion criteria 
were dysthymia with subthreshold depressive symp-
toms that had lasted for 2 years or more; major depres-
sion within the past 6 months; lifetime history of other 
psychiatric disorders (generalized anxiety disorder, 
psychosis, schizophrenia, or bipolar affective disor-
der); alcohol or substance abuse; presence of serious 
suicidal risk; medical illness with a prognosis of less 
than 6 months to live; current receipt of treatments 
(antidepressants or other psychotropic medications, or 
enrollment in any form of psychological interventions) 
for any depressive disorders or symptoms; and inabil-
ity to read or write.
Patients provided written consent. This study was 
approved by the Joint Chinese University of Hong 
Kong-New Territories East Cluster Clinical Research 
Ethics Committee (CREC Ref No.: CRE-2012.583). The 
clinical registry number was ChiCTR-TCS-14004601.
Procedure
Randomization was conducted after patients returned 
a baseline questionnaire. A statistician who was not 
involved in any part of the study independently ran-
domized patients by using a predetermined random 
table generated by Microsoft Excel 2003 (Microsoft 
Corporation). Patients were randomly assigned to 2 
treatment arms: behavioral activation with mindful-
ness (BAM) and usual care. The sealed randomization 
number was not decoded until the patient was assigned 
to its corresponding randomization number. The allo-
cation was concealed from the researchers, research 
assistants, and coordinators who carried out the base-
line assessment or recorded the data.
Group BAM Intervention
We used the BAM interventions for depression and 
well-being17 because of their established effectiveness. 
A treatment outline was retrieved from the workbook 
and adapted for the Chinese culture (Supplemental 
Appendix, available at http://www.annfammed.org/
content/16/2/111/suppl/DC1/). The final interven-
tion protocol was established after conduct of a pilot 
study. The intervention consisted of weekly 2-hour 
sessions for 8 consecutive weeks. The first 4 sessions 
entailed psychoeducation with respect to well-being; 
setting short- and long-term goals; self-monitoring of 
activity and mood using activity logs to recognize 
the association between specific activities and mood; 
scheduling daily activities; and identifying avoidance 
and its impact to allow patients to be more aware of 
their decision making. Sessions 5 through 7 included 
a 0.5-hour behavioral activation review and a 1.5-hour 
mindfulness practice that consisted of training on basic 
mindfulness skills including body scan and both sit-
ting and walking meditation. Mindfulness practice was 
consolidated to make the patients cultivate attention 
on their behavioral patterns. All patients were provided 
with a compact disc including 6 audio recordings of 
guided meditations for home practice (body scan, 
sitting meditation, lake meditation, and mountain 
meditation). The home practice was expected to be 
10 minutes/day on at least 6 days/week after session 
5, increasing to 20 minutes/day after session 6, and 
increasing further to 45 minutes/day after session 7 so 
that there was an incremental increase of practice time, 
which may facilitate adaptation to these activities. The 
last session, session 8, aimed to review the previous 
skills learned and to reinforce these skills in daily life.
The BAM patients were divided into 9 training 
cohorts for the intervention. Four allied health profes-

sionals (1 nurse, 3 social workers) served as instructors. 
None had prior training in behavioral activation or 
mindfulness. All received 32 hours of training and 8 
hours of supervision by 2 experienced clinical psychol-
ogists with more than 4 years of experience in behav-
ioral activation plus 1 clinical psychologist who was 
an experienced mindfulness instructor and had taught 
mindfulness-based programs for more than 10 years.
Usual Care
Generally, patients with subthreshold depression 
in primary care were not referred for mental health 
intervention but received active monitoring or regular 
minimal counseling from primary care physicians. 
Patients assigned to the usual care group continued 
to receive their usual medical care from physicians 
in the general outpatient clinics and were allowed 
unrestricted access to medical care for their concerns 
about depression or anxiety. Our research team did 
not provide any additional mental health intervention 
to patients in this group.
BAM Intervention Fidelity Assessment
Two clinical psychologists independently assessed 2 
aspects of fidelity of the BAM intervention: adherence 
and competence. We assessed 12.5% of the treat-
ment courses. The number of adherence items ranged 
from 7 to 11, depending on the outline of the sessions. 
Response options ranged from 0 (not covered at all) to 
2 (adequately covered) or 3 (covered thoroughly). As 
there was no consensus about the definition of good 
adherence to BAM, we defined high treatment fidelity as 
the rating of at least 80% of items as adequately covered 
or thoroughly covered. We developed the competence 
measure from a fidelity guide of group cognitive behav-
ioral therapy23 and covered the assessment of the BAM 
intervention and group engagement. Fourteen items 
were rated on a 7-point scale (0 to 6), with an average 
score of 4.0 indicating competent BAM delivery.
Outcomes
The trial’s primary outcome was reduction of depres-
sive symptoms at 12 months. It was measured by a 
validated Chinese version of the Beck Depression 
Inventory-II (BDI-II) that included 21 items, with pos-
sible total scores ranging from 0 to 63.24-26
A secondary outcome was the incidence of major 
depressive disorder defined by Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) criteria. 
Presence of major depressive disorder was ascertained 
by research assistants with a master’s degree in coun-
seling using the Structured Clinical Interview for 
DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID).27 The research assis-
tants were blinded to the patient’s group allocation.
We assessed 5 other secondary outcomes. (1) The 
validated Chinese version of the 12-item Medical 
Outcomes Study Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) 
assessed health-related quality of life, including both 
physical and mental functioning, and well-being.28 
(2) The 8-item Activity and Circumstances Change 
Questionnaire (ACCQ)16 assessed the extent to which 
patients experienced both activity change and circum-
stantial change. For each item, patients responded on 
a 5-point Likert scale with 1 indicating no positive 
change and 5 indicating great positive change. (3) The 
Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)29 was used to allow 
patients to rate their impairment in 3 life domains 
(work, social, and family/home management) using a 
scale from 0 to 10, where 0 indicates no impairment 
and 10 indicates extreme impairment. (4) The State 
Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)30 was used to measure 
anxiety symptoms. Based on a 4-point Likert scale, the 
inventory has 2 separate components: state anxiety 
(STAI-S) and trait anxiety (STAI-T). (5) A self-reported 
treatment evaluation was conducted immediately after 
the intervention to assess patient satisfaction. Six 
aspects (content, format, atmosphere, relationship with 
other group members, location and environment, and 
overall satisfaction) were captured on a scale from 1, 
indicating “dissatisfied,” to 5, indicating “very satisfied.”
With the exception of major depressive disorder 
(assessed only at baseline and 12-month follow-up), all 
outcomes were assessed at baseline, end of interven-
tion, the 5-month follow-up (ie, 3 months after inter-
vention), and the 12-month follow-up (ie, 10 months 
after intervention).
Statistical Methods
We performed descriptive analyses of patients’ baseline 
characteristics, including age, sex, marital status, educa-
tional background, medical history, and PHQ-9 score. 
For primary analyses, treatment outcomes were assessed 
by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with the baseline 
BDI-II scale score and other significantly different base-
line characteristics as the covariates, and group as the 
factor. Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat 
basis. We used a modified intention-to-treat sample by 
including all patients in the original group assignment 
of the random allocation with complete data (observed 
data).14 The effect size was calculated by Cohen d.31,32 
Effect sizes of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 were respectively 
defined as small, medium, and large.33 
We also completed a sensitivity analysis to assess 
the effect of missing data using multiple imputation 
models. Multiple imputation was conducted by creat-
ing 20 complete data sets by chained equations under 
the assumption that data were missing at random (R 
package: MICE; version 2.2.5; R Project for Statistical

Computing).34 We adopted the Rubin rule to calculate 
the effect estimates from the imputed data sets.35 We 
also did a per-protocol analysis by including those 
patients who completed their treatment as originally 
assigned: those in the BAM group who attended at 
least 6 sessions and those in the usual care group who 
returned questionnaires and stayed in the group.36 
We compared the incidence of major depressive dis-
order between groups. P values were computed by logis-
tic regression analysis with group and other significantly 
different baseline characteristics as 
covariates. In our sensitivity analy-
sis, we also assessed the effect of 
BAM training cohort and location 
(as the fixed covariate). An effect 
of the BAM instructor was tested 
by ANOVA (only with data from 
the intervention group), with pri-
mary time point (12 months) as 
the outcome and instructor as the 
group effect.
RESULTS
About 11% of the patients in pri-
mary care clinics (1,619 of 15,199) 
were identified as eligible for the 
study, and 14% of these eligible 
patients (231 of 1,619) agreed to 
participate (Figure 1). A total of 
115 patients were assigned to the 
BAM group and 116 patients were 
assigned to the usual care group. 
In the modified intention-to-treat 
population, 90.4% of the patients 
in the BAM group (104 of 115) 
and 98.3% in the usual care 
group (114 of 116), were assessed 
at the end of the intervention 
period, and 71.3% (82 of 115) and 
87.1% (101 of 116), respectively, 
were assessed at 12 months. 
The large majority of patients 
were female (93.1%), housewives 
or retired (61.9%), and married 
(72.8%) (Table 1). The mean age 
was 54.0 years. Except for marital 
status and cancer history, demo-
graphic characteristics were bal-
anced between the 2 groups.
Attrition and Attendance
Overall, 85.2% of patients in the 
BAM group (98 of 115) attended 
at least 1 intervention session. Six patients did not 
attend any sessions, although they returned question-
naires at the end of the intervention. On average, 
patients attended 6.1 sessions out of the 8 sessions 
offered. In the per-protocol analysis, 66 patients 
(67.3%) in the BAM group and 98 patients (84.5%) 
in usual care group were evaluated. There were no 
significant differences in the patient characteristics 
among those patients who were included in the per-
protocol analysis and those patients who were not.

Depressive Symptoms and Secondary Outcomes
Table 2 shows the results of our analysis of the primary 
outcome and secondary outcomes. At the end of the 
intervention, compared with the usual care group, the 
BAM group had a significantly more favorable change in 
level of depressive symptoms as assessed with the BDI-II 
scale (between-group mean difference = –3.57; 95% 
CI, –5.38 to –1.78; Cohen d = –0.54; 95% CI, –0.82 to 
–0.27). The BAM group also had greater improvements 
in quality of life for the mental component summary 
score (between-group mean difference = 3.22; 95% CI, 
1.09 to 5.35; Cohen d = 0.41; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.69) and 
ACCQ score (between-group mean difference = 2.62; 
95% CI, 1.13 to 4.11; Cohen d = 0.48; 95% CI, 0.21 to 
0.75). There was a trend toward a reduction in anxiety 
assessed with the STAI-S scale favoring the BAM group 
as well (between-group mean difference = –2.18; 95% 
CI, –4.44 to –0.08; Cohen d = –0.26; 95% CI, –0.54 to 
–0.01). The estimated marginal means for the primary 
and secondary outcomes at the end of the interven-
tion and follow-up are given in Supplementary Figures 
1 through 7 (available at http://www.annfammed.org/
content/16/2/111/suppl/DC1/). 
At the 5-month follow-up, there was still a sig-
nificantly lower level of depressive symptoms in the 
BAM group as compared with the control group 
(P = .015). At the 12-month follow-up, BAM had a per-
sistent albeit small benefit over usual care in reducing 
depressive symptoms (between-group mean differ-
ence = –3.85; 95% CI, –6.36 to –1.34; Cohen d = –0.46; 
95% CI, –0.76 to –0.16) and was associated with a 
lower incidence of major depressive disorder (10.8% 
vs 26.8%; P = .01). There was no significant difference 
between groups for the other secondary outcomes. 
The treatment effects after adjusting for BAM train-
ing cohort or location were comparable to those seen 
in the primary analysis (Supplemental Table 1, avail-
able at http://www.annfammed.org/content/16/2/111/
suppl/DC1/), and there was no 
indication of an instructor effect 
(F = 1.010, P = .39).
The analysis using imputed 
data showed a significant improve-
ment in depressive symptoms 
at the end of the intervention 
(P <.001) and at the 12-month 
follow-up (P = .01) in the BAM 
group, but there was only a 
trend in symptom change at the 
5-month follow-up (P = .051). 
In the per-protocol analysis, 
the BAM group had signifi-
cantly lower levels of depressive 
symptoms compared with the 
usual care group at the end of 
the intervention (P = .001), 5 
months (P = .012), and 12 months 
(P = .003), findings consistent with 
those of the primary analysis.
BAM Intervention Fidelity 
and Evaluation
The BAM intervention was deliv-
ered according to the protocol. 
Fully 90% of items (43 out of 48) 
followed the protocol. Percent-
age of content delivered accord-
ing to protocol was higher for 
the mindfulness-only sessions 
than for the behavioral activa-
tion sessions (91.7% and 88.9%, 
respectively). Clinical psycholo-
gists rated the 4 therapists as

competent in delivering the treatment for both the 
behavioral activation sessions (mean = 4.47, SD = 0.46) 
and the mindfulness sessions (mean = 4.12, SD = 0.43).
Our evaluation of 5 aspects of the BAM course 
showed that the mean overall satisfaction level was 4.16 
(SD = 0.85). The satisfaction with course content and 
philosophy, class format, class atmosphere, relation-
ship between class members, and class location and 
environment were, respectively, 3.98 (SD = 0.92), 3.97 
(SD = 0.86), 4.19 (SD = 0.82), 4.09 (SD = 0.91), and 4.21 
(SD = 0.83). More than 80% of the patients (79 of 98) 
thought the instructor affected them positively. The 
majority (60.0%) reported that they kept in touch with 
other group members after the intervention ended. 
Approximately 80% (77 of 98) thought the practice 
and homework helped reduce their depressive symp-
toms. The majority of patients indicated that they 
would keep practicing the learned skills in the future 
(74.5%; 73 of 98) and would recommend this interven-
tion to others (85.9%; 85 of 98).

 BAM FOR DEPRESSION

DISCUSSION
We found that the BAM intervention had both short-
term and long-term effects in reducing depressive 
symptoms among patients with subthreshold depres-
sion in primary care. The between-group mean dif-
ference in score was 3.85 points on the BDI-II scale at 
the time of intervention completion, which was about 
22% of the follow-up score in the usual care control 
arm and exceeds the 17.5% mean clinically important 
difference identified by Button et al.37 BAM still had a 
small benefit in reducing 
subthreshold depression 
at 12 months. Similar 
effect sizes for improve-
ments have been reported 
for individual cogni-
tive behavioral therapy, 
problem-solving therapy, 
interpersonal psychother-
apy, and other individual 
psychological interven-
tions.38 Generalizability 
of the BAM intervention 
to a broader population, 
such as patients with more 
severe symptoms or those 
with dysthymia, is pos-
sible but needs further 
research as our study 
included only patients 
who fulfilled the eligibility 
criteria and had greater 
representation of patients 
with certain characteris-
tics (eg, female sex and 
occupation of housewife).
The incidence of major 
depressive disorder among 
people with subthreshold 
depression ranges from 
8% to 47%.39-43 Strategies 
to prevent the onset of a 
major depressive episode 
can be highly effective. 
The combination of 
behavioral activation and 
mindfulness performed 
well in the prevention of 
major depressive disorder 
in our study: incidence in 
the BAM group was less 
than half that in the usual 
care group. BAM can 
be viewed as a preven-
tive intervention for major depressive disorder among 
patients with subthreshold depressive symptoms who 
have not had a major depression episode within the 
past 6 months. Given the recurrent nature of major 
depressive disorder, it would be informative to fur-
ther evaluate the response to BAM among those with 
chronic depression or dysthymia, as we excluded such 
patients from our study.
The objective of behavioral activation is to increase 
positive reinforcement and rewarding experiences in 
life. Although behavioral activation is action oriented 
while mindfulness emphasizes the acceptance and 
awareness of present moment emotions, thoughts, and 
bodily sensations, the two can be complementary. 
Previous research suggests that mindfulness practice 
could also generate positive emotions by cultivating 
self-compassion and self-confidence through an upward 
spiral process.44 We postulate that the maintenance of 
positive effects at 12 months could be related to the 
ongoing practice of mindfulness skills, as patients were 
given audio clips to promote ongoing practice.
The BAM intervention demonstrated short-term effi-
cacy in improving quality of life, but only in the mental 
domain. It is possible that patients’ physical condition 
and functional impairments are more difficult to change. 
Although some studies using either behavioral activation 
or mindfulness-based intervention have found significant 
improvement in quality of life,45,46 others have not.47,48
We found a marginally significant reduction of anxi-
ety symptoms with BAM at the end of the intervention 
in our primary analysis. As the objective of this study 
was to evaluate the efficacy of BAM among patients 
with depressive symptoms, we do not know whether 
the same improvement could be observed among peo-
ple with a principal diagnosis of anxiety disorders.
Fidelity assessments showed that the BAM inter-
vention was delivered according to and adhered to 
the protocol, and allied mental health workers were 
competent in delivering behavioral activation as well 
as basic mindfulness training. These health workers 
received a total of 40 hours of training and clinical 
supervision. We suggest that allied health care work-
ers have the capacity to deliver the BAM intervention 
effectively after structured training.
Our study has several limitations. First, it was 
impossible to conceal the group assignment after the 
first BAM session; thus, patients in the intervention 
group might have reported improvement because of a 
Hawthorne effect. Second, it was difficult to differenti-
ate the efficacy of the behavioral activation and mind-
fulness components as we combined them. We did 
not distinguish the 2 components because we hoped 
to make the intervention a cohesive whole for future 
application in clinical practice, as it appears that the 2

components may complement each other. But further 
recognition of the useful components is also important 
to understand the mechanism that is responsible for 
the effects observed. Third, generalizability of the 
intervention to a broader population might be limited 
given that a large share of patients declined to enroll 
in the study because of time conflicts and were unable 
to attend the 8 weekly sessions. This may be an issue 
especially among people with the hectic lifestyle often 
seen in developed cities, such as Hong Kong, poten-
tially making it difficult for the working population 
to spare 2 hours a week for 8 consecutive weeks. The 
mildness of patients’ depressive symptoms might have 
also played a role, as perhaps they felt that their symp-
toms were not severe enough for intervention. Fourth, 
the relatively low uptake rate and lower follow-up rate 
in the BAM group vs the usual care group may also 
raise issues regarding the implementation and feasibil-
ity of using BAM in real-life clinical practice. As the 
reasons for dropout were mainly related to schedule 
conflicts, however, and we did not find any significant 
difference in patient characteristics between those who 
did and did not drop out, modifications of the mode of 
BAM delivery may be needed to make it more accept-
able to potential participants.
In conclusion, we have shown that BAM is a poten-
tially feasible and efficacious intervention for reducing 
depressive symptoms and preventing major depression 
among people with subthreshold depression in primary 
care. As this intervention can be delivered by allied 
health care professionals with only about 1 week of 
training and can be implemented in primary care set-
tings, we are conducting a cost-effectiveness and quali-
tative study to better understand the health service 
use implications, as well the potential mechanisms and 
relevant components acceptable to patients, to further 
improve this intervention and increase its reach among 
primary care patients.
