Polypharmacy and Gait Performance in Community–dwelling
Older Adults
Claudene George, MD, RPh* and Joe Verghese, MBBS, MS†
OBJECTIVES: To
examine
the
relationship
between
polypharmacy and gait performance during simple (normal
walk (NW)) and complex (walking while talking (WWT))
locomotion.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
SETTING: Community.
PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling
older
adults
(N = 482).
MEASUREMENTS: Polypharmacy, defined as use of five
or more medications and a cohort-specific alternate defini-
tion of eight or more medications, was examined. Velocity
(cm/s) measured quantitatively during NW and WWT con-
ditions.
RESULTS: The 164 participants (34%) with polyphar-
macy of five or more medications were older (77.0 � 6.6
vs 76.0 � 6.4) and more likely to have hypertension, con-
gestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarc-
tion, and higher body mass index (BMI) and to have fallen
within the last year than the remaining 318 without
polypharmacy and walked 6 cm/s slower (P = .004) during
NW and 4 cm/s slower during WWT (P = .07), adjusting
for age, sex, and education. Group differences were not
statistically significant after adjusting for comorbidities.
Prevalence of polypharmacy of eight or more medications
was 10%. This group walked 11 cm/s slower during NW
(P < .001) and 8.6 cm/s slower during WWT (P = .01)
than those without polypharmacy, adjusted for age, sex,
and education. Participants taking eight or more medica-
tions had slower NW (8.5 cm/s; P = .01), and WWT
(6.9 cm/s; P = .07), compared to those without polyphar-
macy, adjusting for comorbidities. Adjustments for BMI,
high-risk drugs, falls, and comorbidities yielded slower
NW (9.4 cm/s, P = .005) and WWT (7.9 cm/s, P = .04
among those with polypharmacy compared to those with-
out polypharmacy).
CONCLUSION: These
results
suggest
an
association
between polypharmacy and locomotion that medical comor-
bidities only partly explained. J Am Geriatr Soc 65:2082–

P
olypharmacy can be defined as the use of more medica-
tions than is clinically indicated.1 Current data suggest
that the use of five or more medications is an acceptable
definition of polypharmacy and this cut point is associated
with risk of adverse outcomes such as falls, frailty, disabil-
ity, and mortality in older adults.2 The mechanism for the
influence of polypharmacy on adverse outcomes is multi-
factorial. Polypharmacy predisposes people to adverse drug
events (ADEs), drug interactions, medication nonadher-
ence, and poor functional capacity.3 The effect is amplified
in older adults, who are more prone to medication side
effects and outcomes such as falls, which can lead to hos-
pitalization and further functional decline.
The ability to ambulate is a marker of independence and
an indicator of good health status in older adults. Although
specific classes of medications have been linked to impaired
mobility and its consequences, such as falls,4 the effect of
polypharmacy on locomotion is not well established. Human
locomotion can be studied under simple or complex condi-
tions. Simple locomotion or normal walk (NW) speed in com-
munity-dwelling older adults ranges from 0.8 to 1.2 cm/s.5
Complex locomotion such as walking while performing a
secondary cognitive activity such as reciting alternate letters
of the alphabet (walking while talking (WWT)), have been
helpful in revealing early age-related declines in gait and
cognition,6,7 and decline in performance on WWT has been
linked to falls in community-dwelling older adults.7,8 Norms
for WWT were considered to be within 1 standard deviation
below group means. WWT provides the opportunity for
early detection and intervention in people who are at risk
and whose lack of function might not be evidenced by exam-
ining normal walk velocity alone. Given the link between
polypharmacy and negative outcomes such as falls, explor-
ing the relationship between and WWT performance in
community-dwelling older adults who are free of major

 cognitive or functional impairments is of importance. There
is a paucity of data regarding this relationship.
To address the knowledge gap regarding polyphar-
macy effects on simple (NW) and complex (WWT) loco-
motion, this cross-sectional study was conducted in 482
community-dwelling older adults. Polypharmacy is modifi-
able, and if the results show a relationship between
polypharmacy and locomotion, it might be possible to
improve mobility and decrease the risk of adverse out-
comes such as falls in older adults.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
A cross-sectional study was performed in 482 community-
dwelling adults aged 65 and older enrolled in the Central
Control of Mobility in Aging (CCMA) study, a longitudinal
study at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx,
New York. The main aim of the CCMA study is to determine
the cognitive processes and underlying brain substrates or
neuronal structures responsible for mobility in aging. The
study design has been previously reported.9 In brief, partici-
pants are initially screened by telephone using cognitive
screeners (AD8 Dementia Screening interview,10 Memory
Impairment Screen11) to exclude individuals with dementia.
Participants who pass the screen and express interest in the
study are invited for further in-person testing. Inclusion crite-
ria were age 65 and older, English speaking, ambulatory,
residing in the community, and planning to be in the area for
the next 3 years. Exclusion criteria for the parent study
included dementia (self-reported, detected on the CCMA
telephone cognitive screen, or diagnosed by study clinicians
at in-house visits), inability to walk independently, history of
severe neurological or psychiatric disorder, significant loss of
vision or hearing, recent or planned surgical procedure that
could affect mobility, and serious chronic or acute illnesses.
All eligible participants provided informed consent. The
Albert Einstein College of Medicine institutional review
board approved the study protocol.
Medication History
The study clinician ascertained Medication use of partici-
pants using a structured questionnaire and an informal
interview at the in-person visit. Medication history was
further confirmed by reviewing medication bottles and any
available medical records and interviewing family members
when available. Over-the-counter (OTC) supplement, her-
bal agent, and prescription medication use was docu-
mented.
Moderate
to
high
medication
adherence
has
previously been reported in this cohort.12 Polypharmacy
was defined as the use of five or more medications (regard-
less of class of medication) based upon widely used opera-
tional definition in the literature.2 High-risk drugs were
defined based upon the American Geriatrics Society Beers
Criteria for potentially inappropriate medication use.13
Quantitative Gait Assessments
Gait parameters were quantitatively assessed using an elec-
tronic walkway (GAITRite, CIR Systems, Havertown, PA).
Participants walked on a 20-foot instrumented walkway
that included 4 feet of nonrecording surface at either end
to account for initial acceleration and terminal decelera-
tion. None of the participants included in this analysis
used an assistive device during their walking trial or had
any attached monitors. This system has been used in previ-
ous studies and has excellent reliability.14
The dependent variable was velocity (cm/s) measured
during steady state NW and WWT. Participants were
instructed to walk at their normal pace during NW for
one trial. During WWT, participants were instructed to
walk while reciting alternate letters of the alphabet (e.g.,
A, C, E). Previous studies have shown that WWT speed
predicts falls, frailty, and mortality in community-dwelling
older adults.8,15
Clinical Evaluations
Participants underwent detailed clinical, cognitive, and
mobility assessments at their baseline in-house visit and
yearly follow-up visits. They were also interviewed about
medical conditions and cognitive status and underwent
neurological examinations with the study clinician. As pre-
viously
reported,9
participants
reported
presence
or
absence of physician-diagnosed chronic illnesses (depres-
sion, Parkinson’s disease, chronic obstructive lung disease,
severe arthritis) and vascular diseases (diabetes mellitus,
heart failure, hypertension, angina pectoris, myocardial
infarction, stroke) upon entry to the study to calculate a
Global Health Score (range 0–10, 1 point for each medical
condition). Medical history was further confirmed by inter-
viewing family members when available and reviewing
available medical records.
Global
cognitive
status
was
evaluated
using
the
Repeatable Battery for Assessment of Neuropsychological
Status, which measures immediate and delayed memory,
attention,
language,
and
visuospatial
abilities
and
is
reported in the form of a total index score.16 Body mass
index (BMI) was calculated using the participant’s weight
and height.
Statistical Analysis
Baseline characteristics of participants with (≥5) and with-
out (<5) polypharmacy were compared using descriptive
statistics. Polypharmacy definitions vary in previous studies
in terms of medication count used2 and whether prescription
and OTC medications were included in the definition.17
Hence, a study-specific alternate definition of polypharmacy
as use of eight or more medications (including OTC supple-
ments, herbal agents, and prescription medications), which
10% of the cohort reported, was also examined. This alter-
nate definition also was to account for this more-stringent
definition of polypharmacy, which included nonprescription
medications, unlike many previous studies. On average, par-
ticipants were taking 1.1 � 1.3 OTC, herbal, or nonpre-
scription agents. Two standard deviations above the mean
for the overall cohort equated to three additional medica-
tions, which further justified the use of eight more medica-
tions. Independent-sample t-tests were used for continuous
variables and chi-square tests for no change categorical vari-
ables. Linear regression analysis was used to determine the

 relationship between polypharmacy (independent variable)
and gait velocity during NW and WWT cross sectional ana-
lysis (dependent variable), adjusting for age, sex, education
(years of schooling), BMI, falls, presence of high-risk drugs,
and medical comorbidities in the reported models. Covari-
ates were chosen to be included in the models if they were
significant at P ≤ .05 in the univariate analyses (Table 1) or
based upon biological plausibility. Adjustments were made
for falls, although falls could be interpreted as an outcome.
Adjustments were also not made for use of specific classes of
medications but were made for medical comorbidities signif-
icant at P ≤ .05 in bivariate analysis comparing the groups
with and without polypharmacy. Five models were created.
Model 1 adjusted for age, sex, and educational level. Medi-
cal comorbidities were added to the adjustments for Model
2 to explore whether polypharmacy was associated with gait
speed irrespective of medical comorbidities. In Model 3,
falls were added to the adjustments for Model 1. Model 4
adjusted for BMI, presence of high-risk drugs, and falls, in
addition to age, sex, and education. Model 5 adjusted for
age, sex, educational level, and all variables significant at
P < .05 with bivariate analysis comparing the polyphar-
macy and no polypharmacy groups. Model assumptions
were examined analytically and graphically and were ade-
quately met. All analyses were performed using SPSS version
21 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).
RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics
The prevalence of polypharmacy was 34% (n = 164) of
the 482 participants examined in the CCMA sample
between June 2011 and February 2016 defined as the use
of five or more medications and 10% (n = 48) using a def-
inition of eight or more medications. Table 1 shows the
baseline
characteristics
of
the
164
participants
with
polypharmacy and the 318 without polypharmacy. Mean
age was 77.0 � 6.6 in the polypharmacy group and
76.0 � 6.4 in the no polypharmacy group. Participants
with polypharmacy were more likely to have hypertension,
congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and a history of
myocardial infarction. The Global Health Score of those
with polypharmacy (2.2) was significantly higher than that
of those without (1.4) (P < .001). The polypharmacy
group was also more likely to have had a fall within the
last year (26.8% vs 16.1%, P = .004) and to have a higher
BMI (30.3 vs 28.7 kg/m2; P = .02) than those without.
The mean gait speed of the cohort was 98.0 � 22.8 cm/s
for NW and 68.7 � 24.2 cm/s for WWT. Normal gait
speed in community-dwelling older adults ranges from 80
to 120 cm/s. Norms for WWT were considered to be
within 1 standard deviation below group means.

 used with the greatest frequency. Those with polyphar-
macy were taking more medications in all listed classes
than those without polyphamacy; nonsteroidal antiinflam-
matory drugs and antihypertensive combinations were
more frequently used in the polypharmacy group, but the
difference was not statistically significant. Only one partic-
ipant in this ambulatory, community-dwelling sample was
taking an antipsychotic. Fifty-three percent of the partici-
pants were taking nonprescription medications; 24% were
using one agent, 27% were using two or more, and 3%
were taking five or more.
Gait Performance
Gait performance is presented in Table 3. Participants
with polypharmacy walked 6 cm/s slower (P = .004) dur-
ing NW and 4 cm/s slower during WWT (P = .07) than
participants without polypharmacy after adjusting for age,
sex, and educational level (Model 1). When additionally
adjusting for medical comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes
mellitus, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction
(Model 2), the group differences were not statistically sig-
nificant for polypharmacy defined as the use of five or

 more medications; suggesting that polypharmacy may be
reflecting disease effect on the walking tasks. Adjusting for
history of falls did not moderate the effects of polyphar-
macy on gait for NW or WWT. After adjusting for age,
sex, educational level, BMI, high-risk drugs, and falls in
Model 4, NW speed (estimate: �5.7 cm/s, P = .007) and
WWT speed (estimate: �5.0 cm/s, P = .03) were slower in
the polypharmacy group than the no polypharmacy group.
In Model 5, adjusted for all covariates including medical
comorbidities, only NW speed was statistically significantly
lower among those with polypharmacy when polyphar-
macy was defined as the use of five or more medications.
WWT speed was when polypharmacy was defined as the
use of five or more medications.
In a separate analysis, using the CCMA-specific defini-
tion of polypharmacy as eight or more medications, NW
(�11 cm/s, P = .001) and WWT (�8.6 cm/s, P = .01)
speed were significantly slower in those with polypharmacy
than in those without when adjustments were made for age,
sex, and educational level (Table 3, Model 1). When adjust-
ing for age, sex, educational level, and medical comorbidi-
ties in Model 2, NW speed was slower in participants with
polypharmacy (�8.5 cm/s, P = .01), but the association
between polypharmacy and WWT speed was not significant
(estimate: �6.9 cm/s, P = .07). NW slower normal walk
velocity in those with polypharmacy compared to those
without polypharmacy (�9.4 cm/s, P = .005) and WWT
(�7.9 cm/s, P = .04) speed were slower when adjustments
were made for age, sex, educational level, BMI, falls, high-
risk drugs, and medical comorbidities (Model 5).
DISCUSSION
These results show a strong association between gait speed
during simple locomotion and polypharmacy (≥5 medica-
tions) in community-dwelling older adults. The strongest
explanation for the association between polypharmacy and
gait speed appears to be that polypharmacy is a surrogate
for having multiple chronic medical illnesses, although the
stronger association between the study-specific polyphar-
macy definition (≥8) and NW and WWT suggests that
multimorbidity partly but not completely explains this
relationship. The association between locomotion and
polypharmacy persisted after adjustment for the use high-
risk drugs, which suggests that the association between
polypharmacy and slower gait speed cannot be attributed
to the use of high-risk drugs alone.
A major difference between the current study defini-
tion of polypharmacy and those used in many previous
studies is that the current included nonprescription (OTC
and herbal agents) and prescription drugs in the medica-
tion count. Although this could have led to an overestima-
tion of the prevalence of polypharmacy in this sample and
a bias toward the null when polypharmacy was defined as
five or more medications, the authors felt strongly that
OTC and herbal agents may have risks similar to those of
prescription
drugs
and
that
disentangling
this
would
require a subjective decision on the part of the study
authors to determine which medications were important
enough to be documented.
This study is one of the first to explore the effect
polypharmacy on gait performance as measured according
to quantitative assessments of simple and complex locomo-
tion in community-dwelling older adults free of major cog-
nitive and functional limitations. Previous studies support
the findings but with notable differences. In hospitalized
older adults, a previous study18 noted that poor physical
performance measured according to grip strength and
walking speed was associated with polypharmacy defined
as eight or more medications. In community-dwelling older
adults, several prospective studies19,20 have revealed that
polypharmacy
predicted
a
decline
in
lower
extremity
strength19 and functional decline measured as performance
of
activities
of
daily
living
(ADLs)20
independent
of
comorbidities.
With a polypharmacy definition of five or more medi-
cations, WWT gait speed (complex locomotion) did not
decline to a statistically significant degree in all models
examined. Although participants taking more medications
may walk more slowly than those taking fewer, number of
medications alone does not appear to affect their ability to
prioritize during cognitive motor tasks. One explanation is
that the sample represents a subset of high-functioning
community-dwelling older adults who are more robust and
less likely to have significant cognitive effects because of
polypharmacy. When the definition of polypharmacy was
adjusted to include participants taking eight or more medi-
cations, gait speeds with simple and complex tasks were sig-
nificantly slower, adjusting for age, sex, educational level,
BMI, medical comorbidities, falls, and high-risk drugs. The
results suggest an association between more-extreme defini-
tions of polypharmacy (≥8) and decline in complex locomo-
tion. Given the link between WWT speed and falls7,8 in
high-functioning older adults, polypharmacy (≥8 medica-
tions) is a useful marker for those who may be at risk.
Strengths and Limitations
The strengths of this study include the use of a cohort of
community-dwelling older adults without functional or
cognitive impairments and the use of systematic gait
assessment. The cross-sectional design limits establishment
of causation, but follow-up is continuing, and there are
plans to report longitudinal associations. It is likely that
the results would be more exaggerated in a hospitalized or
institutionalized population, but additional confounders
would have to be considered. Although drug interactions
may play a role in gait impairment, it was not possible to
account for all possible drug–drug, drug–food, or drug–
disease interactions given the sample size. Although several
potential confounders were controlled for in the analyses,
residual or unmeasured confounding may still be present.
The influence of dose and duration of use of medications
in gait performance was not examined, although disease
duration and severity may confound these variables; those
taking higher doses for longer might have more-severe
comorbidities or could be more stable than those who
have been newly started on a regimen or newly diagnosed.
The effects of ethnicity and socioeconomic status on the
relationship between polypharmacy and gait were not
explored, but the study population was rather homoge-
neous, being from one area of the Bronx, New York. The
cohort was 79% white and 16% African American, and
5% self-identified as Hispanic white (1.7%), Hispanic

 black (0.2%), Asian (1.2%), or other (0.2%). Hence, there
are insufficient numbers to compare polypharmacy effects
according to race. Further study is needed to determine the
effect of specific classes of medication on complex locomo-
tion and explore the interplay between polypharmacy,
specific classes of medication, and medical comorbidities.
CONCLUSION
These results suggest an association between polypharmacy
and locomotion in aging that multimorbidity only partly
explained. Longitudinal studies are needed to follow up on
these findings. Polypharmacy including nonprescription
medication use should be ascertained in all older adults
regardless of their level of function. In clinical practice,
physicians should consider measuring walking speed during
NW and WWT in individuals taking multiple medications
to assess and identify a potentially modifiable mobility risk.
