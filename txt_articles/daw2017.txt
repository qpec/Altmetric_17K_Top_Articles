Women In The United States
Experience High Rates Of
Coverage ‘Churn’ In Months Before
And After Childbirth
ABSTRACT Insurance transitions—sometimes referred to as
“churn”—before and after childbirth can adversely affect the continuity
and quality of care. Yet little is known about coverage patterns and
changes for women giving birth in the United States. Using nationally
representative survey data for the period 2005–13, we found high rates of
insurance transitions before and after delivery. Half of women who were
uninsured nine months before delivery had acquired Medicaid or CHIP
coverage by the month of delivery, but 55 percent of women with that
coverage at delivery experienced a coverage gap in the ensuing six
months. Risk factors associated with insurance loss after delivery include
not speaking English at home, being unmarried, having Medicaid or
CHIP coverage at delivery, living in the South, and having a family
income of 100–185 percent of the poverty level. To minimize the adverse
effects of coverage disruptions, states should consider policies that
promote the continuity of coverage for childbearing women, particularly
those with pregnancy-related Medicaid eligibility.
H
aving health insurance facili-
tates women’s access to timely
prenatal and postpartum care,
which improves birth outcomes
and
supports
the
long-term
health of women and newborns.1 However, wom-
en are vulnerable to insurance disruptions be-
fore and after childbirth because of the changes
in employment, income, and program eligibility
that commonly accompany childbirth.
Under federal law, states must provide Medic-
aid coverage for pregnancy-related medical ser-
vices for women with family incomes under
138 percent of the federal poverty level. States
can extend coverage to higher-income pregnant
women via Medicaid or the Children’s Health
Insurance Program (CHIP). As of January 2017,
state income eligibility ceilings for pregnancy-
related Medicaid or CHIP varied from 138 per-
cent to 380 percent of poverty.2
Coverage options are limited for women who
become pregnant while uninsured or who lose
private insurance during pregnancy but do not
qualify for Medicaid. Under the Affordable Care
Act (ACA), all nongroup and group insurance
plans must include maternity benefits. However,
pregnancy is not a qualifying event for special
enrollment in a qualified health plan on the
ACA’s insurance Marketplaces—though deliver-
ing a child is.
Even when women gain eligibility for Medic-
aid as a result of pregnancy, their eligibility is
time-limited: Pregnant women are eligible only
from conception to sixty days postpartum, after
which they must either requalify for Medicaid as
parents or adults, obtain private insurance, or
become uninsured. In all states, there is a gap
between Medicaid eligibility thresholds for preg-
nant women and those for parents or adults (as
of January 2017, state income eligibility ceilings
for parents varied from 18 percent to 221 percent
of poverty).3 In the District of Columbia and the

 thirty-one states that had expanded eligibility for
Medicaid under the ACA as of January 2017,
women with family incomes below 138 percent
of poverty retain eligibility after childbirth. In
the nineteen nonexpansion states, many women
have family incomes that fall in the gap between
Medicaid eligibility for adults or parents and
eligibility for Marketplace subsidies (more than
100 percent of poverty). The median Medicaid
eligibility cutoff for parents in these states is just
44 percent of poverty, and only three of the states
(Maine, Tennessee, and Wisconsin) grant eligi-
bility for parents with incomes at or above pov-
erty.3 Even women who continue to be eligible
for Medicaid after delivery may face administra-
tive or knowledge-based barriers to postpartum
Medicaid enrollment.4
While no study to our knowledge has exam-
ined the effect of insurance transitions before
and after childbirth on health outcomes, re-
search on other populations has shown that cov-
erage disruptions—sometimes called health in-
surance “churn”—increase the odds of delaying
needed care, reduce the use of preventive ser-
vices such as mammography and Pap tests,
and worsen the perceived quality of care.5–7 Fur-
thermore, changing health plans, even without a
gap in coverage, has been associated with a
65 percent increase in the likelihood of delaying
care because of cost and a 37 percent decrease in
the odds of having a usual source of care.8
Published reports about insurance coverage of
childbearing women in the United States are
limited to specific states and use cross-sectional
data, measuring payment for delivery or cover-
age at one point in a pregnancy instead of track-
ing coverage longitudinally across the period
before and after childbirth.9–12 To address this
gap, we used nationally representative longitu-
dinal survey data for the period 2005–13 to esti-
mate monthly rates of insurance coverage and
insurance transitions for women before and af-
ter childbirth. We also identified risk factors for
coverage lapses.
Our results serve as a valuable baseline from
which to evaluate the potential effects of the
ACA, as well as any proposed reforms to Medic-
aid or the ACA under the administration of Pres-
ident Donald Trump, on childbearing women.
Understanding typical patterns of insurance re-
lated to pregnancy is critical for designing poli-
cies that promote continuity of coverage across
Medicaid eligibility categories and between
Medicaid and private insurance.
Study Data And Methods
Data We used pooled panels of the Medical Ex-
penditure Panel Survey–Household Component
(MEPS-HC) that covered the period 2005–13.
Each MEPS-HC panel is a nationally represen-
tative sample of civilian, noninstitutionalized
households. The survey collects detailed infor-
mation on respondents’ demographic character-
istics, health care utilization, health expendi-
tures, and monthly insurance status over a
two-year period.
Sample We identified 2,948 births for 2,843
unique women from inpatient hospital files us-
ing International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), and
MEPS Clinical Classification Codes for labor/
delivery (for births in the period 2005–07) and
the delivery indicator variable reported in MEPS
(available for births in the period 2008–13).13 For
the 105 women with two deliveries, we randomly
selected one delivery to maintain independence
of the observations.We excluded deliveries after
which an infant could not be found in the house-
hold or if the infant’s month of birth and the
delivery record month differed by more than
one month. The final sample included 2,726
women (95.9 percent). This approach excluded
out-of-hospital births, which represented just
2 percent of US births in 2013.14
Insurance Variables We classified monthly
insurance status for each month, starting from
three months before conception (calculated by
the month of delivery) through six months post-
partum.
Insurance status was coded as one of three
mutually exclusive categories: Medicaid/CHIP,
private/other insurance, or no insurance. The
Medicaid/CHIP category included women who
reported any coverage by Medicaid, CHIP, or
“any other public insurance or state program.”
Of note, 0.4 percent of our sample reported
Medicare coverage, but that was always in com-
bination with Medicaid. Thus, the women in
this group were included in the Medicaid or
CHIP category. The category of private/other
insurance included women who reported only
employer-sponsored
coverage,
TRICARE/
CHAMPVA coverage, or “other private insur-
ance—source unknown.” In other words, we ap-
plied a hierarchy in which women with any Med-
icaid or CHIP coverage were classified as having
Medicaid or CHIP regardless of other coverage
sources. We defined a lapse in coverage as any
month in the category of no insurance.
Analysis We used logistic regression to esti-
mate the likelihood of an insurance lapse during
two periods: nine months up to and including
the delivery month and six months after the de-
livery month. Covariates were age, education,
race, Hispanic ethnicity, English language spo-
ken at home, marital status, family income, cen-
sus region, and insurance type in the delivery

 month.We adjusted for the wave of the survey to
control for changes over time. Demographic
characteristics were those reported in the calen-
dar year of the delivery. All estimates used MEPS-
HC longitudinal sampling weights.
Limitations This study had several limita-
tions. First, we identified deliveries using inpa-
tient records provided by hospitals as part of
MEPS. Procedure codes from hospital discharge
data are commonly used to identify obstetric
events.15 We suspect that a high proportion of
the events we identified were true deliveries,
particularly since we included only those events
in which a newborn was subsequently identified
in the relevant household. Though MEPS asks
extensively about household composition, there
is a small possibility that we did not identify all
deliveries to women in the sample because of
underreporting by women or inaccurate report-
ing by hospitals.
Second, without information on gestational
age, we could not assign a pregnancy status to
each calendar month. In our model of prenatal
insurance lapses, we analyzed coverage during
the nine months up to and including the delivery
month. Of course, not all pregnancies last nine
months, but the bias from this assumption is
likely minimal: Among all singleton births in
the United States in 2013, 89 percent had a ges-
tational age of thirty-seven weeks or longer, and
only 3 percent had an age of less than thirty-four
weeks.14 We conducted a sensitivity analysis by
excluding women with a procedure code indicat-
ing preterm delivery, which did not significantly
change our results.
Finally, similar to other national surveys,
MEPS tends to overreport uninsurance.16 A vali-
dation study found that 10 percent of MEPS
respondents who report being uninsured hold
private insurance.17 A synthesis of validation
studies of insurance reporting in large surveys
found that 74–88 percent of Medicaid beneficia-
ries correctly report Medicaid coverage and ap-
proximately 90 percent report being insured.18
Study Results
The majority of the women in our sample had
private or other insurance, and the overall pro-
portion of women in that category was relatively
stable before, during, and after pregnancy (Ex-
hibit 1). Leading up to delivery, the proportion of
women who were uninsured decreased, and the
proportion with Medicaid or CHIP increased.
The lowest rate of uninsurance (13 percent)
was in the month of delivery. However, the un-
insurance rate rose rapidly after delivery, nearly
returning to the prepregnancy rate (23 percent
six months after delivery, compared to 25 per-
cent in the tenth month before delivery). These
overall patterns did not change substantively af-
ter the implementation of the dependent cover-
age provision of the ACA in 2010 (see Appendix
Exhibit A1).19
Insurance Changes Before Childbirth In
the nine months leading up to and including
the delivery month, 58 percent of women expe-
rienced at least one change in insurance status,
and 62 percent were uninsured in at least one
month (Exhibit 2). Rates of coverage changes
(49 percent) and uninsurance (49 percent) be-
fore delivery were lowest among women with
private insurance in the month of delivery. In
contrast, 73 percent of women with Medicaid
or CHIP in the month of delivery experienced
an insurance coverage change during the nine
months before delivery, and 65 percent were
uninsured in at least one month. Switching from
no insurance to Medicaid was the most common
change: 51 percent of women who were un
insured before pregnancy had acquired Medic-
aid coverage by their delivery month (for more
detailed statistics on month-to-month changes,
see Appendix Exhibits A2 and A3).19
Family income was the only measured risk
factor that was significantly associated with an
insurance lapse in the nine months up to and
including the delivery month. Higher-income
women were much less likely than low-income
women to be uninsured in the nine months pre-
ceding delivery (see Appendix Exhibit A4).19

 Insurance Changes After Childbirth Sixty-
four percent of women with private insurance in
the month of delivery held that type of insurance
continuously for six months after delivery (Ex-
hibit 2). In contrast, only 41 percent of those
covered by Medicaid or CHIP in the month of
delivery had the same type of insurance contin-
uously for the following six months, and they
were more likely than women with private insur-
ance to experience month-to-month changes in
insurance status. The number of uninsured
months following delivery was also much higher
among women covered by Medicaid or CHIP at
delivery, with 55 percent experiencing at least
one uninsured month (Exhibit 2) and 25 percent
experiencing two or more uninsured months
over the next half year (Exhibit 3). For women
who were uninsured in the delivery month,
57 percent remained uninsured for the entire
six months postpartum.
Risk factors significantly associated with an
insurance lapse included having an income of
100–185 percent of poverty (compared to having
an income of less than 50 percent of poverty),
not speaking English at home, being unmarried,
having Medicaid or CHIP coverage at delivery
(compared to having private or other coverage),
and living in the South (compared to living in the
Northeast) (Exhibit 4). Adjusted odds ratios are
shown in Appendix Exhibit A4.19 Holding other
maternal characteristics constant, the predicted
probability of an insurance lapse in the six
months after delivery was 18 percent lower if
women had private insurance instead of Medic-
aid or CHIP in the month of delivery (Exhibit 4).

 Discussion
Ensuring that pregnant women have insurance
coverage has been a goal of policy efforts for
decades,includingthefederal expansionof Med-
icaid to cover pregnant women in the 1980s, the
CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2009, and the ACA.
Using nationally representative longitudinal
data, this study makes two important contribu-
tions to the scarce literature on insurance dy-
namics for childbearing women. First, it pro-
vides a granular view of both insurance churn
and disruptions that occur on a month-to-month
basis. We found that high rates of coverage at
delivery mask considerable churning in insur-
ance coverage, with high transition rates in
the prenatal and postpartum months—especially
for women with Medicaid or CHIP coverage in
the month of delivery.
Second, to our knowledge, ours is the first
study to track insurance rates in the six months
following childbirth.We found that maintaining
postpartum coverage is a particular challenge:
Nearly half of all births were followed by a period
of uninsurance for the mother in the six months
after delivery, which would have affected an es-
timated 1.8 million families in 2013.14,20 Among
women covered by Medicaid or CHIP in the
month of delivery, 55 percent became uninsured
at some point during the six months after giving
birth. This suggests that many women have no
other accessible source of coverage when preg-
nancy-related Medicaid coverage ends sixty days
after delivery.
Comparison To Previous Research There
are few data sources that can be used to measure
insurance coverage in the months before and
after childbirth. We have demonstrated that
MEPS data can be used for this purpose. How-
ever, this approach requires pooling data for
several years. Besides our estimates using MEPS,
the only other estimates of insurance transitions
before childbirth used data from the Preg-
nancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System
(PRAMS).9,10 An analysis of 2009 PRAMS data,
which sampled women in twenty-nine states,
found that 30 percent of women had a source
of payment for their delivery that was different
from their coverage source in the month before
pregnancy.10 Women with a change in coverage
source were more likely to have incomes of less
than 200 percent of poverty, be Hispanic, have
relatively less education, be unmarried, and have
had an unintended pregnancy.10
Other cross-sectional analyses have estimated
only rates of uninsurance among pregnant wom-
en and payment sources for delivery. A study
using data for 2000–09 from the National Health
Interview Survey found that 10 percent of preg-
nant women reported being uninsured.12 The
2009 analysis of PRAMS data found that only
1.5 percent of women reported self-paying for
delivery, but this is likely an underestimate.
The sample used in that analysis excluded many
states in the South as well as the 8.9 percent
of women who did not respond or responded
“other” to insurance questions.10 Widely cited
analyses based on birth certificate data for
thirty-three states in 2010 from the National
Vital Statistics System showed that 44.9 percent
of deliveries were paid for by Medicaid and
50.8 percent by private or other insurance, while

 in 4.4 percent of deliveries the mother was un-
insured or paid out of pocket.11
There are several possible reasons why, com-
pared to other studies, we found a larger share
(12.5 percent) of women who reported having no
insurance in the month of delivery. First, some
women who receive Medicaid payment for deliv-
ery expenses may reasonably consider them-
selves to be uninsured in the month of delivery.
Uninsured women who are eligible for Medicaid
may enroll in pregnancy-related Medicaid cover-
age during the delivery episode. In addition,
some women may receive emergency Medicaid
that covers only their delivery expenses. For ex-
ample, in North Carolina, 16 percent of Med-
icaid-paid births are funded through emergency
Medicaid.21 Many of these births are to undocu-
mented women, who account for 7 percent of all
births in the United States—this is consistent
with the low-income and disproportionately
Hispanic population described in the analysis
of PRAMS data mentioned above.10,22
Second, unlike the PRAMS and the National
Vital Statistics System birth certificate data,
MEPS samples all states—including many in
the South that, compared to other states, have
both higher rates of uninsurance and lower Med-
icaid eligibility thresholds for pregnant women.
The set of included states matters: The estimated
share of self-paid deliveries ranges widely across
states. For example, it is 0.8 percent in the Dis-
trict of Columbia, 8.2 percent in Texas, 9.0 per-
cent in Florida, and 16.4 percent in Nevada,
based on data from the National Vital Statistics
System.11
Finally, an advantage of MEPS is that it en-
abled us to measure insurance changes over
time. However, as stated in the “Limitations”
section, uninsurance rates tend to be over-
reported in national surveys, including MEPS.16
To calculate an upper-bound estimate, if we as-
sume that 20 percent of those who reported be-
ing uninsured actually had private insurance and
another 20 percent actually had Medicaid or
CHIP coverage, we would have overestimated
the level of uninsurance by five percentage
points (that is, with those assumptions we would
estimate a 7.5 percent rate of uninsurance, in-
stead of a 12.5 percent rate, in the month of
delivery).17 We expect reporting errors to be rel-
atively constant over time and thus to minimally
affect our estimates of insurance transitions.
Effects Of Coverage Changes And Lapses
Lack of insurance and coverage discontinuity
have important implications for both women
and infants, from preconception to postpartum.
Before delivery, women receiving regular health
care can take advantage of interventions to mod-
ify health behaviors and conditions that contrib-
ute to adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as
smoking or the use of prescription drugs, but
being uninsured is a barrier to receiving such
timely care.23 Lacking insurance before concep-
tion may also decrease the effectiveness of cov-
erage gained during pregnancy: Women without
a regular provider before pregnancy are less like-
ly to receive timely prenatal care.24
Insurance gaps during pregnancy place wom-
en at elevated risk of delaying the initiation of
prenatal care and receiving fewer than the rec-
ommended seven to ten prenatal care visits.25
Inadequate prenatal care is associated with ad-
verse birth outcomes, including prematurity,
stillbirth, and neonatal death.1 Having low-
income women go without insurance during
pregnancy may also be detrimental from a cost
perspective: Studies have found that spending
on prenatal care results in savings in future Med-
icaid costs.26,27
After delivery, coverage disruptions may pre-
sent a barrier to accessing postpartum care, es-
pecially the recommended six-week postpartum
visit—which only 40 percent of US women re-
ceive after giving birth.28 Uninsured women
may struggle to manage existing chronic health
issues and common pregnancy-related condi-
tions such as pain and urinary incontinence,
many of which persist through the year after
giving birth.29 Postpartum depression, which af-
fects an estimated 13–19 percent of US women
after giving birth, could go unidentified or un-
treated without proper follow-up care, which
would negatively affect a woman’s health and
her relationships with family members.30 Our
finding that a quarter of women with Medicaid
or CHIP coverage at delivery experienced two or
more uninsured months in the six months after
delivery is particularly concerning, given the ev-
idence that having a low income and Medicaid
coverage during pregnancy is associated with
higher rates of postpartum depressive symp-
toms.31 Coverage gaps after delivery may also

pregnant women have

 limit access to family planning services—includ-
ing counseling on adequate spacing between
pregnancies, which is associated with improved
birth outcomes.32 Indeed, postpartum loss of
Medicaid coverage may partly explain why the
odds of a short interval between pregnancies are
41 percent higher among women who have a
Medicaid-paid
delivery,
compared
to
those
who do not.33
The well-being of infants can also be negatively
affected by mothers’ lack of insurance after de-
livery. Poor management of maternal mental
health adversely affects a child’s cognitive, be-
havioral, and socioemotional development.34,35
Moreover, having an uninsured parent is associ-
ated with a child’s lower likelihood of having
insurance and receiving recommended pediatric
care.36,37
Policy Implications
We analyzed data collected for the period before
the implementation of the ACA Medicaid expan-
sions and insurance Marketplaces in 2014, and
we found that one-quarter of women were un-
insured nine months before childbirth. Coverage
gains under the ACA have likely resulted in a
significant decrease in this share. From 2013
to 2015, the uninsurance rate among women
of reproductive age decreased from 19.9 percent
to12.8percentnationwideandfrom33.9percent
to 23.2 percent for women with incomes below
the poverty level.38 Early evidence also suggests
that theACA’s dependent coverage provision was
associated with a small increase in the number of
deliveries paid for by private insurance among
women ages 19–25, though this was mostly driv-
en by a decrease in Medicaid-funded instead of
self-paid deliveries.39
Women who are uninsured when they become
pregnant and who are not eligible for Medicaid
will continue to face challenges under the ACA.
Pregnancy is not a qualifying event that allows
special enrollment in a qualified health plan,
raising concerns that these women will be left
without a coverage option.40 Paying out of pocket
for pregnancy-related services represents a sub-
stantial financial burden: The average payment
for prenatal care and delivery among women
with
commercial
insurance
in
2010
was
$18,329 for a vaginal delivery and $27,866 for
a cesarean section.41 New York and Vermont,
which included pregnancy as a qualifying event
for enrollment in a qualified health plan as of
2016, will serve as examples of the implications
of
expanding
special
enrollment
to
preg-
nant women.
By covering more women regardless of their
pregnancy or parental status, state Medicaid ex-
pansions under the ACA are poised to improve
continuity of coverage for low-income women.
From 2013 to 2015, the percentage of reproduc-
tive-age women with Medicaid coverage in-
creased by 34 percent in expansion states (from
17.7 percent to 23.7 percent), compared to an
increase of 7 percent in nonexpansion states
(from 14.0 percent to 15.0 percent).38 In the nine-
teen states that have not expanded Medicaid,
continuity of coverage for low-income women
will remain a critical concern, and if the Medic-
aid expansion is rolled back by the Trump ad-
ministration, these concerns will likely increase
again in states that have expanded.We found that
women in the South were more likely than other
women to be uninsured after delivery, probably
in part because of the low income thresholds to
qualify for Medicaid as a parent in the South.
Differential Medicaid expansion is likely to fur-
ther increase between-state disparities in access
to coverage for women of childbearing age, es-
pecially before conception and after delivery.
States should consider revising Medicaid or
CHIP eligibility criteria to explicitly recognize
the transition from pregnancy to parenthood.
States could also consider expanding outreach
efforts, streamlining enrollment processes, or
introducing special navigators to smooth the
transition for low-income women from preg-
nancy-related Medicaid to adult or parental Med-
icaid or a qualified health plan. Such efforts
could be particularly effective for women whose
primary language is not English, whom we found
to be at greater risk of being uninsured after
delivery.
While the future of the ACA in the Trump ad-
ministration remains unclear, it is likely that
Medicaid will continue to be a major source of
coverage for pregnant women. Thus, the cover-
age discontinuities identified in this study will
remain a concern, particularly for women who
become eligible for Medicaid because of their
pregnancy and reside in states with limited Med-
icaid options for parents and low-income adults.

Downloaded from 
 signing their Medicaid programs, they should
consider how policy proposals that affect repro-
ductive-age women will affect coverage continu-
ity, and thus access to care, in the months sur-
rounding childbirth. Indeed, although data are
not yet available to evaluate how the ACAaffected
coverage transitions before and after childbirth,
such evidence is needed to inform federal and
state policies. It is likely that overall, the ACA’s
Medicaid and qualified health plan expansions—
while in some cases increasing the potential for
complicated insurance transitions—have signif-
icantly improved coverage rates for women both
before and after childbirth. Further evidence in
this area could help inform the debate over re-
pealing the law and any future changes to it.
Conclusion
The months surrounding childbirth are charac-
terized by frequent gaps and changes in coverage
that may compromise women’s timely access to
recommended care and the continuity and qual-
ity of such care. While the ACA coverage expan-
sions improved coverage levels among women of
reproductive age, challenges remain for main-
taining continuity of coverage in the period sur-
rounding childbirth, especially for women who
qualify for pregnancy-related Medicaid cover-
age. State and federal policy makers should
consider implementing policies to help smooth
coverage transitions from preconception to the
postpartum period by aligning coverage options
for women of reproductive age, pregnant wom-
en, and parents. ▪
