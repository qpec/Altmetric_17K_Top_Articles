Abstract
Objective
To investigate the kinetics and metabolism of caffeine in serum from patients with Parkinson
disease (PD) and controls using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry.
Methods
Levels of caffeine and its 11 metabolites in serum from 108 patients with PD and 31 age-
matched healthy controls were examined by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry.
Mutations in caffeine-associated genes were screened by direct sequencing.
Results
Serum levels of caffeine and 9 of its downstream metabolites were significantly decreased even
in patients with early PD, unrelated to total caffeine intake or disease severity. No significant
genetic variations in CYP1A2 or CYP2E1, encoding cytochrome P450 enzymes primarily
involved in metabolizing caffeine in humans, were detected compared with controls. Likewise,
caffeine concentrations in patients with PD with motor complications were significantly de-
creased compared with those without motor complications. No associations between disease
severity and single nucleotide variants of the ADORA2A gene encoding adenosine 2A receptor
were detected, implying a dissociation of receptor sensitivity changes and phenotype. The
profile of serum caffeine and metabolite levels was identified as a potential diagnostic biomarker
by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.
Conclusion
Absolute lower levels of caffeine and caffeine metabolite profiles are promising diagnostic
biomarkers for early PD. This is consistent with the neuroprotective effect of caffeine previously
revealed by epidemiologic and experimental studies.
Classification of evidence
This study provides Class III evidence that decreased serum levels of caffeine and its metab-
olites identify patients with PD.

 Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease char-
acterized by motor and nonmotor symptoms.1 There have
been several reports suggesting an inverse association be-
tween daily caffeine consumption and a reduced risk of de-
veloping PD in men, and in women not taking hormone
replacement therapy.2,3 Caffeine can protect against nigral
neurodegeneration
in
the
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-
tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)–induced PD mouse model.4,5
Likewise, the caffeine metabolites paraxanthine and theoph-
ylline similarly attenuate MPTP neurotoxicity.6 However,
changes in the entire caffeine metabolic pathway in patients
with PD remain unclear.
Clinically, caffeine appears to improve motor symptoms by
antagonizing adenosine 2A receptors (A2A-Rs).7–9 One of the
biological effects of caffeine is the nonselective antagonism of
A2A-Rs, which is encoded by the A2A-R gene (ADORA2A).
Caffeine is primarily metabolized by 2 cytochrome P450
enzymes, cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily A member 2
(CYP1A2) and cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily E
member
1
(CYP2E1).10–12
No
associations
between
ADORA2A and CYP1A2 gene variants and polymorphisms
and PD onset frequencies have been detected,13–15 but the
association of caffeine with motor fluctuations has not been
addressed.
The development of blood-based biomarkers for PD is of
high priority because of the easy sample collection pro-
cedure.16 Four caffeine metabolites have been identified as
biomarkers for de novo PD progression using gas
chromatography–mass
spectrometry
and
liquid
chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS).17 We have
also reported decreased serum levels of caffeine and 4
downstream metabolites in patients with PD receiving
antiparkinsonian treatment.18 Here we analyzed serum
caffeine and metabolite concentrations and variations in
caffeine-associated genes.
Methods
Participants
We recruited 31 healthy controls (13 men) and 108
patients with PD without dementia (58 men) (table 1). All
participants with PD had been treated at Juntendo Uni-
versity Hospital. Control participants were the patients’
spouses and patients with asymptomatic brain ischemia at
Juntendo University Hospital. Patients were eligible for
inclusion if they were diagnosed with idiopathic PD based
on Movement Disorders Society criteria, with no dementia
(with a Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] score
≥24).1 Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) stages and Unified Parkin-
son’s Disease Rating Scale motor section (UPDRS-III)
scores were defined during the “on” phase for practical and
ethical reasons. Levodopa equivalent doses (LEDs) were
calculated based on a previous report.19 We assessed caf-
feine concentrations as 60 mg per cup of coffee, 30 mg per
cup of tea, and 20 mg per cup of green tea, using the Food
Society Commission of Japan guidelines.20 No participant
had a history of cancer, aspiration pneumonia, or collagen
vascular diseases.
In addition to the cohort for serum caffeine metabolism
analysis, we recruited an additional 51 healthy controls (25
men) (total controls = 82) and 67 patients with PD (33 men)
(total patients with PD = 176) for gene analysis.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations,
and patient consents
This study protocol complied with the Declaration of Hel-
sinki and was approved by the ethics committee of Juntendo
University (2012157). Written informed consent was given
by all participants.
Sample collection
Blood samples were collected at the outpatient department
of Juntendo University Hospital between December 2013
and February 2014. Following overnight fasting (12–14
hours), a serum sample was obtained using 7 mL EDTA-
2Na blood spits (PN7; SRL, Tokyo, Japan) followed by 2–3
inversions. The samples then rested for 30–60 minutes at
4°C followed by centrifugation for 15 minutes at ×3,000g.
The serum was separated into collection tubes and stored
in liquid nitrogen until analysis.
Sample preparation
Analyzers were blinded to all serum samples and partic-
ipants’ information. We used the same methodology for the
sample preparation as the one employed in a previous
study.21 Briefly, 100 μL of serum was immediately plunged
into 400 μL acetonitrile with 200 pmol of caffeine-(tri-
methyl-13C3); 3-methylxanthine-2,4,5,6-13C4, 1,3,9-15N3;
7-methylxanthine-2,4,5,6-13C4, 1,3-15N2; paraxanthine-d3;
and theophylline-2-13C-1, 3-15N2 were purchased from

 Sigma (St. Louis, MO) as internal standards. The solution
was centrifuged at ×17,000g for 20 minutes at 4°C, and the
upper aqueous layer collected and passed through a 0.2 μm
nylon filter. The sample was dissolved in 50 μL of Milli-Q
water after nitrogen drying and 5 μL was applied to LC-MS
analysis.
Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry
Caffeine and 11 downstream metabolites were separated by
high-performance liquid chromatography (Gilson, Mid-
dleton, WI) using a Synergi Fusion RP column (100 ×
3.0 mm, 2.5 μm particle, 100 ˚
A; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA).
Column temperature was set at 50°C. The high-performance
liquid chromatography system was connected to TSQ
Quantum Ultra AM mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher
Scientific; Waltham, MA). The target compounds were ana-
lyzed in selected reaction monitoring positive ionization
mode.
Genomic DNA analysis
DNA was extracted from peripheral blood according to
standard protocol using a Qiagen (Venlo, the Nether-
lands) kit. To exclude the possibility that caffeine metab-
olism is accelerated by cytochrome P450 upregulation,11,12
we performed genetic screening of CYP1A2 and CYP2E1.
Also, as PD motor fluctuations might derive from altered
sensitivity of A2A-R, a main target of caffeine and its
metabolites, we investigated ADORA2A gene variations by
direct sequencing. Pathogenicity of the identified missense
variants was assessed using the sorting intolerant from
tolerant (SIFT) method.22 The frequencies of each variant
were evaluated using the Exome Aggregation Consortium
(ExAC) database (http://exac.broadinstitute.org/).
Cardiac 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine
scintigraphy
All
patients
with
PD
underwent
cardiac
123I-
metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy to assess
any cardiac sympathetic denervation in the heart. We used the
same methodology as the one employed in a previous study.23
Statistical analysis
When a value was under the limit of detection, we assigned it
half the minimum value of its compound. Wilcoxon tests were
used to compare all individual analyses between controls and
patients with PD. The Steel test, a nonparametric, multiple
comparison test, was used to compare patients stratified by
H&Y stage (I, II, III, and IV) and controls. Receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) analysis was carried out using JMP12
(SAS Institute Japan, Chuo-Ku), and the optimal cutoff values
and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated using You-
den index maximums (sensitivity + specificity − 1).24 Pearson
correlation coefficients were used to assess the relationships
between serum caffeine levels and LED or UPDRS in PD
using JMP12. We used conditional logistic regression analyses
to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence interval for allelic
and genotypic correlations with PD risk. p < 0.05 Was con-
sidered statistically significant.
Classification of level of evidence
This study is rated Class III because of the diagnostic case–
control study design and the risk of spectrum bias.
Results
Participants
Patients with PD and controls had similar mean ages at
blood sampling (table 1). There were no significant dif-
ferences in the sex ratio between patients with PD and
controls. Importantly, no significant differences in total
caffeine intake between controls and patients with PD were
revealed (table 1). Table e-1 (links.lww.com/WNL/A90)
shows the H&Y stages, UPDRS-III scores, MMSE scores,
LED, coffee and caffeine consumption, and wearing-off and
dyskinesia (expressed as motor fluctuations) in these
patients. On average, PD disease severity was mild to
moderate according to H&Y stage and UPDRS-III scores.
When stratified by disease severity, there were no signifi-
cant differences in the sex ratios of each group. Conversely,
age, disease duration, UPDRS-III score, LED, and occur-
rences of wearing-off and dyskinesia (defined as motor
fluctuations) significantly increased with disease severity.
There was no difference in age between patients with PD
and controls in the larger gene analysis cohort (table e-2).
No significant differences between controls and patients
with PD in sex or age were detected.

 Caffeine metabolite serum levels
Serum levels of caffeine and almost all of its 11 downstream
metabolites were lower in patients with PD than in controls (p
< 0.0001) (table 2 and figure e-1, links.lww.com/WNL/A89).
The
3
main
metabolites
generated
from
caffeine—
theophylline, theobromine, and paraxanthine—were signifi-
cantly lower in patients with PD. Although 4 controls had
extremely high serum caffeine levels, and were excluded as
outliers, patients with PD still had lower caffeine levels (p =
0.0004). Serum levels of caffeine in patients with PD corre-
lated with caffeine consumption mildly (p = 0.0476) com-
pared with those in controls (p = 0.0119) (figure e-2). Serum
levels of 1-methyluric acid did not differ between the 2 groups,
but serum 1,3,7-trimethyluric acid levels were higher in
patients with PD than in controls. However, 1-methyluric acid
and 1,3,7-trimethyluric acid levels were under the limit of
detection in 32% and 63% of participants, respectively.
Associations of caffeine metabolites with H&Y
stage, UPDRS-III scores, and LED
Comparing controls and patients with PD in each H&Y stage,
most metabolites were lower in every H&Y stage of PD (table
e-3, links.lww.com/WNL/A90). However, there were no
significant differences in the serum levels of any metabolites in
each H&Y stage by the Steel test. We could not evaluate H&Y
stage V patients because only one was recruited. We analyzed
the coefficients of correlation between the serum levels of
each metabolite and UPDRS-III scores (table e-4). As
expected, UPDRS-III scores did not relate to the serum
concentrations of any metabolite. On the contrary, these
metabolites decreased even in the very early stage of PD.
Although most patients were receiving some antiparkinsonian
drug (98%), LED did not relate to the serum levels of any
metabolite (table e-4).
Diagnostic values of caffeine and metabolites
using ROC curve analyses
To identify whether these metabolites could be potential di-
agnostic biomarkers for PD, we performed ROC curve anal-
ysis for multiple marker combinations using Youden index
maximums (sensitivity + specificity − 1) (figure 1).24 The
AUC of caffeine at 33.04 pmol/10 μL cutoff was 0.78 and the
sensitivity and specificity were 76.9% and 74.2%, respectively.
The AUC improved (0.87) when the main metabolites of
caffeine (i.e., theophylline, theobromine, and paraxanthine)
were included. Moreover, we could distinguish patients with
PD from controls more accurately using the data from all
measurable metabolites (AUC 0.98).
Associations of caffeine metabolites with
constipation, motor fluctuations, and
MIBG scintigraphy
In this study, motor complications, including wearing-off and
dyskinesia, were observed in 47% of patients with PD. Disease
severity was worse in those with motor complications than
those without: UPDRS-III score (mean ± SD), with, 15.96 ±
10.78; without, 11.00 ± 8.40 (p = 0.0084); H&Y stage, with,
2.53 ± 0.92; without, 1.75 ± 0.71 (p < 0.0001). As expected,
serum caffeine levels were significantly lower in PD with
motor fluctuations than without (table 3). 1,7-Dimethyluric
acid showed similar tendency to caffeine (p < 0.0001). No
significant changes of the other metabolites, including the-
ophylline, theobromine, and paraxanthine, were detected in
PD with or without motor fluctuations (data not shown). The

 occurrence (or predominance) of constipation, a common
clinical feature of PD, was 75.9% and χ2 tests revealed no
statistical significance of caffeine levels in PD with or without
it (table 3). Myocardial scintigraphy was performed in most
patients with PD (71%), and a reduced early (or delayed)
heart/mediastinum ratio of MIBG uptake, a well-established
diagnostic characteristic as well as a disease severity bio-
marker, was evident in 71% of patients with PD.25,26 However,
the tests did not reveal any correlation between reduced
MIBG uptake and serum caffeine concentrations (table 3).
Analysis of genes associated with
caffeine metabolism
Two single nucleotide variations (SNVs) in ADORA2A oc-
curred at similar frequencies in patients with PD with motor
complications to those without (data not shown). We
detected 7 SNVs previously reported in the public ExAC
database (table 4). Four CYP1A2 and CYP2E1 SNVs
(rs35796837, rs45486893, rs72559710, and rs28371746)
were identified with similar frequencies in both patients with
PD and controls. The other 3 (rs13306115, rs138652540, and
rs72547517) were found only in patients with PD, at a higher
frequency than in ExAC, but were not statistically significant.
Another
3
SNVs,
ADORA2A
rs57851876,
CYP1A2
rs2470890, and CYP2E1 rs2515641, were detected (table 4),
with no significant differences in frequency between patients
with PD and controls. Overall our genomic analyses of
caffeine-related genes revealed no differences in SNV fre-
quencies between patients with PD and controls.
Discussion
In this study, the absolute serum concentrations of caffeine and
9 of its downstream metabolites were significantly lower in
patients with PD than in controls. Both CYP1A2 and CYP2E1,
the main metabolizers of caffeine in humans, had no significant
SNV differences between controls and patients with PD. No
significant associations between disease severity and the levels
of each of metabolite were detected in patients with PD.
Caffeine metabolite profiles may be reliable diagnostic bio-
markers for early PD. As patients with PD have severe H&Y
stages, occurrence ratio of motor fluctuations increased more;
however, levels of caffeine and theophylline mildly decreased,
consistent with their protective effect against progressive de-
cline. Although theophylline and paraxanthine share phar-
macologic properties with caffeine, as all 3 are adenosine
receptor antagonists, the frequencies of ADORA2A SNVs
were similar in patients with PD and controls.
The levels of caffeine and 9 related metabolites were signifi-
cantly decreased in patients with PD, with the levels of 1,3,7-

 trimethyluric acid highly variable and below the limit of de-
tection in more than 50% of patients with PD. 1,3,7-
Trimethyluric acid is a methyl derivative of uric acid, as well as
a metabolite of methylxanthines including caffeine and the-
ophylline, so it is difficult to interpret the clinical significance
of this.
Serum caffeine and estrogen share a common cytochrome
P450 for their metabolism or detoxification.27 According to
epidemiologic and in vivo studies, higher estrogen levels at-
tenuate the effects of administered caffeine on nigral
degeneration.5,28 In this study, no significant differences in
caffeine and its metabolites were detected between male and
female patients (data not shown). We speculate that higher
ratios of postmenopausal women or ethnic differences might
influence
the
relationship
between
PD
and
caffeine
metabolism.
Autophagy,
a
protein
degradation
system
removing
neurodegeneration-associated proteins,29 is associated with
PD pathogenesis. However, a relatively high concentration of
caffeine (>5 mM) is required to exert any effect on the in-
duction of autophagy and apoptosis in tumor cell lines.30 In
vivo studies have demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of
caffeine, paraxanthine, and theophylline in MPTP PD mice
models,6 suggesting that caffeine and its metabolites may
contribute to neuroprotection in PD.
Caffeine is actively absorbed from the small intestine and
more than 95% is metabolized by CYP1A2.31 Moreover,
interindividual variations in CYP1A2 enzymatic activity cor-
relate with differences in caffeine metabolism.32 The CYP1A2
rs762551 AA genotype is related to increased caffeine me-
tabolism,33 but this was not detected in patients with PD or
controls in our cohort. Although the CYP1A2 rs2470890 CC
genotype is associated with a decreased risk of PD in coffee
drinkers,34 this was present at a similar frequency in patients
with PD and controls. However, no significant differences in
these allele frequencies between patients with PD and con-
trols
were
detected.
The

of
the
CYP1A2
rs35796837 and rs45486893, CYP2E1 rs72559710 and
rs28371746, and CYP2E1 rs2515641 SNVs were similar in
both groups. While ADORA2A rs13306115 is a synonymous
amino acid variant, it is possible that the CYP1A2
rs138652540 and rs72547517 variants had different amino
acids in ExAC. In particular, rs72547517 is predicted to be
deleterious according to SIFT analyses22; thus, further in-
vestigation in more cases is needed to clarify this relationship.
Taken together, genetic changes in CYP1A2, CYP2E1, and
ADORA2A, affecting their caffeine metabolism gene products,
may regulate receptor affinity, but were not significantly
detected in PD. This suggests that neither caffeine metabo-
lism nor A2A-R sensitivity has any effects on decreased serum
levels of caffeine metabolites in PD or the incidence of motor
fluctuations, respectively.
Serum levels of caffeine and 9 related metabolites were uni-
formly and significantly decreased in patients with PD, despite
an equivalent caffeine intake to controls. More importantly,
serum levels of caffeine in patients with PD related to caffeine

 intake significantly, but those in controls did more signifi-
cantly, indicative of less caffeine absorption in patients with
PD. Gastrointestinal dysfunction, especially constipation,
affects up to 80% of patients with PD and sometimes precedes
the onset of symptoms by years.35 A recent analysis revealed
that fecal microbial flora is altered in PD, suggesting an en-
vironmental change in the large intestine.36,37 Although con-
stipation and fecal bacterial change are predominantly
attributed to large intestine function, caffeine absorption
mainly occurs in the small intestine, where bacterial over-
growth in PD is associated with levodopa malabsorption
leading to motor fluctuations.31,38 Therefore, further studies
should ascertain whether caffeine absorption in PD is altered
by this.
We observed lower caffeine levels in patients with PD with
motor fluctuations. Caffeine inhibits A2A-R activation,39 and
PD motor symptoms improve with caffeine treatment.8
Istradefylline is a therapeutic agent for PD, acting via A2A-R
inhibition40 and maintaining high caffeine serum concen-
trations, which may serve as a prophylaxis for motor fluctua-
tions. In this study, patients with PD with motor fluctuations
had lower levels of caffeine than those without, consistent
with the beneficial effects of A2A antagonism. Also, consid-
ering disease severity differences between patients with PD
with and without motor fluctuations, lower levels of caffeine in
patients with PD may result in greater disease progression.
A limitation of this study is that it was conducted at a single
university hospital and severe PD cases (H&Y IV and V) were
not fully represented due to the history of aspiration pneu-
monia or cancer exclusion criteria. Thus, it is possible that we
could not detect an association between disease severity and
levels of caffeine and its metabolites due to the reduced power
of the cohort. Also, antiparkinsonian medications may com-
petitively influence the metabolism of caffeine. However, at
least in our cohort, no correlations between LED and the
absolute concentrations of caffeine and its metabolites were
detected. Similar to a recent study showing progressive
decreases in caffeine metabolites with disease exacerbation,17
de novo PD studies including larger study populations and
studies on differential diagnostic values among patients with
PD and other parkinsonian patients should be performed.
We identified significantly decreased serum levels of caffeine
and its downstream metabolites in patients with PD, sug-
gesting early diagnostic biomarkers for the disease. However,
we found no association between caffeine and its metabolites
and disease severity, sex, and gene variants. Furthermore,
significant decreases in caffeine and metabolites were detected
in patients with PD with motor complications and more se-
vere disease symptoms. This further indicates the neuro-
protective effects of caffeine.

Study question
Can serum levels of caffeine and its metabolites serve as
biomarkers for Parkinson disease (PD)?
Summary answer
Low serum levels of caffeine and its metabolites are promising
diagnostic biomarkers for early PD.
What is known and what this article adds
Human and animal studies have suggested that caffeine and its
metabolites protect against PD-related neurodegeneration.
This study provides Class III evidence that low serum levels of
caffeine can indicate the presence of PD.
Participants and setting
This study examined 108 patients with PD and 31 age-
matched healthy controls. The patients had mild to moderate
PD, as indicated by Hoehn & Yahr stages and Unified Par-
kinson’s Disease Rating Scale motor section scores. All par-
ticipants were recruited through the Juntendo University
Hospital in Tokyo and gave serum samples between De-
cember 2013 and February 2014.
Design, size, and duration
The study confirmed that the patients had idiopathic PD
based on Movement Disorders Society criteria. Blood samples
were taken from participants following a 12- to 14-hour fast.
Caffeine and 11 metabolites were separated with high-
performance liquid chromatography and quantified with liq-
uid chromatography–mass spectrometry. Analyzers were
blinded to all serum samples and participants’ information.
Main results and the role of chance
The patients and healthy controls did not significantly differ in
daily caffeine consumption (p = 0.556). Compared to the
healthy controls, the patients had lower serum levels of
caffeine (p < 0.0001) and 10 of the 11 metabolites examined
(p ≤ 0.0023), including the major metabolites theophylline
(p < 0.0001), theobromine (p = 0.0004), and paraxanthine
(p < 0.0001). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
analysis for diagnostic utility found that the area under the
curve (AUC) for caffeine at a cutoff of 33.04 pmol/10 μL was
0.78 and that the corresponding sensitivity and specificity
were 76.9% and 74.2%, respectively. Inclusion of all metab-
olites in the ROC analysis increased the AUC to 0.98.
Bias, confounding, and other reasons
for caution
This study was conducted at a single university hospital, which
might have biased the participant recruitment. Furthermore,
antiparkinsonian medications may affect caffeine metabolism.
Generalizability to other populations
This study did not include patients with severe PD. Fur-
thermore, ethnicity may influence the relationship between
caffeine metabolism and PD.
