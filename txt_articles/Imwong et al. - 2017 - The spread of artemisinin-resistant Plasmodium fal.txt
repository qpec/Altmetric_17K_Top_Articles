Summary
Background Evidence suggests that the PfKelch13 mutations that confer artemisinin resistance in falciparum malaria 
have multiple independent origins across the Greater Mekong subregion, which has motivated a regional malaria 
elimination agenda. We aimed to use molecular genotyping to assess antimalarial drug resistance selection and 
spread in the Greater Mekong subregion.
Methods In this observational study, we tested Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Myanmar, northeastern Thailand, 
southern Laos, and western Cambodia for PfKelch13 mutations and for Pfplasmepsin2 gene amplification (indicating 
piperaquine resistance). We collected blood spots from patients with microscopy or rapid test confirmed uncomplicated 
falciparum malaria. We used microsatellite genotyping to assess genetic relatedness.
Findings As part of studies on the epidemiology of artemisinin-resistant malaria between Jan 1, 2008, and Dec 31, 2015, 
we collected 434 isolates. In 2014–15, a single long PfKelch13 C580Y haplotype (–50 to +31·5 kb) lineage, which 
emerged in western Cambodia in 2008, was detected in 65 of 88 isolates from northeastern Thailand, 86 of 111 isolates 
from southern Laos, and 14 of 14 isolates from western Cambodia, signifying a hard transnational selective sweep. 
Pfplasmepsin2 amplification occurred only within this lineage, and by 2015 these closely related parasites were found 
in ten of the 14 isolates from Cambodia and 15 of 15 isolates from northeastern Thailand. C580Y mutated parasites 
from Myanmar had a different genetic origin.
Interpretation Our results suggest that the dominant artemisinin-resistant P falciparum C580Y lineage probably arose 
in western Cambodia and then spread to Thailand and Laos, outcompeting other parasites and acquiring piperaquine 
resistance. The emergence and spread of fit artemisinin-resistant P falciparum parasite lineages, which then acquire 
partner drug resistance across the Greater Mekong subregion, threatens regional malaria control and elimination 
goals. Elimination of falciparum malaria from this region should be accelerated while available antimalarial drugs 
still remain effective.

Introduction
Artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) have 
become the cornerstone of the treatment of falciparum 
malaria throughout the malaria endemic world.1 New 
antimalarial compounds will not become widely 
available for several more years.2 The emergence and 
geographic spread of artemisinin resistant P falciparum 
in the Greater Mekong subregion (GMS) represents a 
serious threat to global malaria control and to 
aspirations to eliminate malaria. Artemisinin resistance 
results in reduced ring stage susceptibility and 
manifests as slow parasite clearance.3,4 As a result, 
fewer malaria parasites are killed during the 3 days of 
ACT treatment, leaving more for the partner drug to 
remove. This action increases the risk of treatment 
failure and facilitates selection of partner drug 
resistance.2 Resistance to both components of the ACT 
results in substantial reductions in cure rates. ACTs 
containing mefloquine and piperaquine are now failing 
across increasing areas of the GMS.5–8
Retrospective genotyping of archived samples showed 
presence of the artemisinin resistance marker at the 
beginning of the millennium. The PfKelch13 mutations 
that mediate artemisinin resistance appear to have 
arisen independently on multiple occasions.9,10 Some 
have taken this to suggest that a radical firewall 
approach to prevent the spread of these mutations 
might not work, and so prompted abandonment of 
containment and the launch of a regional malaria 
elimination effort in the GMS.11,12 On the other hand, 
the spread of artemisinin resistance has been 
geographically contiguous, and there is no evidence yet 
for independent emergence of resistance in India or 
Africa.4,13 Resistance in P falciparum to the antimalarials

chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimeth 
amine also arose 
on multiple occasions in the GMS and in the case of 
pyrimethamine, resistance eventually a single parasite 
lineage dominated (a so-called hard selective sweep) 
and it was this dominant resistant lineage that spread 
across India and Africa.14,15 Using microsatellite 
genotyping around the PfKelch13 gene in P falciparum 
isolates collected over 7 years from four countries in the 
GMS, we test the hypothesis that history is being 
repeated—ie, that dominant lineages of artemisinin-
resistant falciparum malaria parasites are now 
spreading through the GMS. Using molecular geno-
typing we also investigate the relation between 
artemisinin resistance (PfKelch13 mutation)4,9,10,13 and 
piperaquine resistance (Pfplasmepsin2 amplification)16,17 
and we discuss the implications of the findings for the 
regional and global containment of multidrug-resistant 
falciparum malaria.
Methods
Sample collection
As part of studies on the epidemiology of artemisinin-
resistant malaria (reported previously3,4,18,19 and ongoing; 
trial registration numbers NCT01350856, NCT02453308), 
we collected 434 blood spots from patients with 
microscopy or rapid test confirmed uncomplicated 
falciparum malaria from Pailin, Cambodia (113, 2008, 
2011, and 2015); Champasak, Laos (111, 2013–14), Ubon 
Ratchathani (88, 2014–15) and Phusing (15, 2015) in 
Thailand; and Kyainseikgyi, Kayin, Myanmar (107, 
Jan 1, 2014, to Dec 31, 2015). Approvals for these studies 
were obtained from the ethical review boards of 
the Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University 
(TMEC 12-046); Department of Medical Research, 
Ministry of Health and Sports (Myanmar); The Defence 
Services Medical Ethics Committee (Myanmar); the 
Ministry of Health in Cambodia; and the Oxford Tropical 
Medicine Ethics Committee. We obtained blood spot 
blood samples on filter paper (Whatman 3MM, GE 
Healthcare, UK) and kept samples dry at room 
temperature until DNA extraction. We did DNA 
purification using a QIAgen Kit (QIAgen, Hilden, 
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Assessment of mutations in PfKelch13
We sequenced nested PCR products of the full length of 
the PfKelch13 gene (2181 bp including one exon),4 with 
an ABI Sequencer (Macrogen Inc, Seoul, Korea). Cross 
con 
tamination was monitored by adding negative 
control samples in every run. We aligned sequencing 
results against PfKelch13 of reference strain 3D7 
(putative 9PF13_0238 NCBI Reference Sequence [3D7]: 
XM_001350122.1), using Bioedit software (Abbott, 
Carlsbad, CA, USA). Polymorphic patterns were 
assessed by two people blinded to the origin of the 
sample.
Pfplasmepsin2 gene amplification
We quantified Pfplasmepsin2 copy number using 
relative-quantitative RT-PCR based on SYBR-Green 
fluorescence on an Applied Biosystems ViiA 7Real-
Time-PCR-System16 (Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA, 
USA). We did amplification in triplicate on a total 
volume of 20 μL as singleplex PCR using SsoFast 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed on Nov 9, 2016, using the terms 
“artemisinin resistance”, and “genotype” and “Cambodia”, 
”Thailand”, “Myanmar” and “Laos” without any date or language 
restrictions. This search identified 47 articles, of which 
23 contained information on the epidemiology of 
artemisinin-resistant genotypes. Phyo and colleagues described 
the evolution of artemisinin resistance on the Thailand-Myanmar 
border, and how the E252Q PfKelch mutation predominated 
initially but was overtaken in recent years by C580Y as 
artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) began to fail. 
Takala-Harrison and colleagues conducted a genome-wide 
association study which showed multiple independent 
emergences of PfKelch13 mutations in Plasmodium falciparum 
populations in southeast Asia, but haplotype analysis also 
suggested spread of the Y493H and C580Y mutations from 
Cambodia across the border to Vietnam. Menard and colleagues 
assessed the genetic relatedness of PfKelch13 mutant parasites in 
the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) and also identified 
“numerous emergence events alongside spreading of a small 
group of mutations for artemisinin resistance”.
Added value of this study
This longitudinal study conducted over 8 years in four countries 
has two important findings; that over time single lineages of 
artemisinin-resistant parasites dominate, outcompeting the 
other parasites, and then under continued ACT therapies drug 
pressure, spreads—in one case across three countries—and that 
artemisinin resistance selects for piperaquine resistance.
Implications of all the available evidence
This study shows that artemisinin resistance has continued to 
evolve such that with time, and continued selection pressure, 
what started as multiple independent emergences of 
PfKelch13 mutations was overtaken by a few dominant 
lineages that spread and acquired partner drug resistance. This 
same sequence of events occurred previously when 
antimalarial drug resistance emerged in the GMS and later 
spread to Africa. Malaria elimination efforts need to be 
accelerated in the GMS while antimalarial drugs remain 
effective, particularly in areas where these successful dominant 
P falciparum lineages are found.

Evagreen Supermix (BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA, USA). 
Every amplification run contained three replicates of 
3D7 calibrators and triplicates without template as 
negative controls. β-tubulin served as an internal 
standard for the amount of sample DNA added to the 
reactions. We calculated copy numbers using the 
formula: copy number=2−ΔΔCt with ΔΔCt denoting the 
difference between ΔCt of the unknown sample and ΔCt 
of the reference sample.
Microsatellite genotyping of the regions flanking 
PfKelch13
Microsatellite genotyping of the –56 kb to +72 kb 
regions flanking the PfKelch13 gene was done as 
described previously.20,21 For isolates carrying the 
PfKelch13 C580Y allele, we designed seven additional 
microsatellite markers covering –247 kb to +269 kb and 
for the PfKelch13 R539T allele 17 additional micro-
satellites covering –579 kb to +631 kb (appendix). We 
did single PCR for 35 cycles of 1 minute at 95°C, 
1 minute annealing at 55°C, and 1 minute extension 
at 72°C. The lengths of the PCR-generated products 
were measured by comparison with internal size 
standards (Genescan 500 LIZ) on an ABI 3100 Genetic 
analyser, using Genescan and Genotyper software (PE 
Applied Biosystems) to measure allele lengths and to 
quantify peak heights. Negative control samples were 
included to monitor cross-contamination. We analysed 
a subset of ten samples in triplicate to assess intra-
assay consistency. 79 samples with multiple genotypes 
were included in all analyses except for the assessments 
of genetic relatedness.
Additional assessments of genetic diversity
To assess genetic relatedness in parasites with the long 
PfKelch13 
haplotypes 
and 
between 
Pfplasmepsin2 
amplified and non-amplified parasites, we genotyped 
parasite isolates for variable blocks within the msp1, 
msp2, and glurp genes,22 and for nine microsatellites 
across the genome23 using semi-nested PCR. Genetic 
similarity between isolates was analysed by unweighted 
pair-group method with arithmetic average (Unweighted 
Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean [UPGMA]) 
using BioNumerics software version 7
.5 (Applied Maths, 
Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium).
Analysis
We examined genetic variation at each microsatellite 
locus or heterozygosity (He) using the formula 
He=[n/(n − 1)][1 − ∑pi²], and calculated the sampling 
variance of He as 2(n − 1/n³[2(n − 2)]∑pi³ − ∑pi²)² where n is 
the sample size and pi is the frequency of the i-th allele. 
We constructed a median-joining network diagram 
tree assessing genetic relatedness between parasite 
isolates with different PfKelch13 alleles, based on 
nine micro 
satellite markers spaced at –56 and +72 kb 
intervals in parasite isolates from Pailin from 2008, 2012, 
and 2015, using Network software version 5. Hetero-
zygosity at each location was compared with wild type by 
Mann-Whitney U test.

Results
From Jan 1 to Dec 31, 2008, in Pailin, western 
Cambodia, where artemisinin resistance was first 
described, we identified PfKelch13 gene propeller 
region point mutations in 50 of 59 isolates: C580Y in 
26 of 59 isolates, Y493H in 13 of 59 isolates, R539T in 
eight of 59 isolates, other PfKelch13 mutations in three 
of 59 isolates, and wild-type PfKelch13 was found in 
nine of 59 isolates. The C580Y allele was detected in 37 
of 40 isolates in 2011, and 14 of 14 isolates in 2015, 
whereas R539T was detected in one of 40 isolates 
in 2011, and none of 14 in 2015.
In 2015, in Phusing, northeastern Thailand, approxi-
mately 200 km northeast of Pailin, all 15 isolates

collected contained the C580Y mutation. Over the same 
time period in 2015, the C580Y allele was present in 64 
of 88 isolates from Ubon Ratchathani district (about 
100 km northeast of Phusing), and 17 of 88 isolates 
contained the R539T allele. In 2014, in Champasak, 
southern Laos, approximately 350 km northeast of 
Pailin, 86 of 111 parasite isolates contained the C580Y 
allele and 13 of 111 isolates contained the R539Y allele. 
By contrast, in 2015, in Kyainseikgyi, Kayin, Myanmar, 
about 600 km northwest of Pailin, the C580Y mutation 
was present in only six of 107 samples (table).
In Pailin, Pfplasmepsin2 amplification was observed in 
12 of 59 isolates in 2008, 15 of 40 isolates in 2011, and ten 
of 14 isolates in 2015. In Phusing, all 15 isolates from 2015 
displayed amplification. The median copy number was 
0·98 (range 0·75–3·27) in 2008 and 1·65 (0·66–3·41) in 
2015 in Pailin, and 1·93 (0·55–3·99) in 2015 in Phusing. 
By contrast, amplified Pfplasmepsin2 was found in only 
one of 88 isolates from Ubon Ratchathani, none of 
111 isolates from Champasak, and none of 107 from 
Myanmar.
Comparison of microsatellite haplotypes in 269 isolates 
carrying C580Y with 84 with PfKelch13 wild types from 
the same countries showed a sharp reduction in micro-
satellite variation spanning a –50 to +72 kb region around 
the PfKelch13 gene. Mean He was 0·688 (standard error 
[SE] 0·059) in wild type. Excluding the isolates from 
Myanmar, over 800 km to the west, mean He was 0·687 
(SE 0·058) in wild-type, compared with 0·17 (0·11) in 
C580Y isolates from Pailin 2011–15, p=0·0002; 0 (0) in 
Phusing, Thailand, p=0·0002; 0·046 (0·031) in Ubon 
Ratchathani, Thailand, p=0·0002; and 0·059 (0·053) in 
Champasak, Laos, p=0·0003. The valley of reduced 
diversity was asymmetric in size between the 5ʹ and 
3ʹ sides of the gene and was similar between isolates 
from Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand (appendix). 
Pfplasmepsin2 amplification was observed only in 
parasites with this dominant PfKelch13 C580Y long 
haplotype (53 of 53 isolates). Comparison of the 
nine microsatellite defined PfKelch13 C580Y haplotypes 
of isolates from the four countries showed that the 
C580Y allele found in southeastern Thailand (Phusing 
and Ubon Ratchathani) and southern Laos (Champasak) 
shared a common origin with the C580Y alleles observed 
in Pailin, but was genetically remote from the Myanmar 
haplotype (figure 1). Between 2008 and 2014, in Pailin 
(western Cambodia), the overall mean He of the 
microsatellite defined PfKelch13 haplotypes reduced from 
0·496 (SE 0·005) to 0·158 (0·020; p=0·0002), suggesting 
a selective sweep through the parasite population. 
Parasites with the same C580Y haplotype were not clonal 
since there was significant diversity in microsatellites 
elsewhere in the genome and in the polymorphic loci in 
the msp1, msp2, and glurp genes that showed an overall 
mean He of 0·529 (SE 0·030) for three loci combined 
(individual values: 0·680 [0·040] for glurp, 0·453 [0·316] 
for msp1, and 0·457 [0·019] for msp2).
Microsatellite defined PfKelch13 R539T haplotypes from 
39 parasite isolates from Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand 
were compared with the 87 PfKelch13 wild-type isolates. 
Mean He in wild-type isolates was 0·691 (SE 0·190) 
compared with 0·077 (0·005) in R539T parasites 
(p<0·0001), signifying much reduced micro 
satellite 
diversity –50 to +242 kb around the R539T allele. The 
conserved region around the R539T allele was asymmetric, 
and was larger than in the C580Y haplotype. The R539T 
haplotype was the same in isolates from Ubon Ratchathani 
and Champasak, and was only a single locus different 
from those in Pailin, suggesting a common origin 
(appendix). Nine microsatellite markers flanking the 
PfKelch13 F446I allele were genotyped in six samples from 
Homalin, Sagaing and 20 samples from Kyainseikgyi, 
Kayin, Myanmar. A unique identical PfKelch13 haplotype 
was observed in Kayin with a mean He 0 (SD 0), which was 
not observed elsewhere. By comparison, the mean He 
assessed from 45 local PfKelch13 wild-type isolates 
was 0·599 (SE 0·010), signifying high diversity.
A median-joining network tree was generated using 
microsatellite defined haplotypes around PfKelch13 from 
346 P falciparum isolates obtained from the four countries 
(appendix). There was strong genetic clustering of the 
C580Y allele in parasites from Cambodia, Thailand, and 
Laos, far from the dispersed haplotypes observed in

northern and southern Myanmar and from local parasites 
containing wild type or the F446I allele. Clustering was 
also observed among isolates containing the R539T allele 
in samples from Cambodia, Thailand, and Laos.
Using microsatellite typing across the genome, 
relatedness between the 49 isolates with concurrent 
Pfplasmepsin2 amplification was compared with the 
40 Pfplasmepsin2 single copy isolates but the same 
PfKelch13 C580Y long haplotype. Overall mean He of the 
Pfplasmepsin2 amplified isolates was significantly lower 
than that of single copy isolates (p=0.021) and cluster 
analysis by UPGMA showed that isolates containing 
Pfplasmepsin2 amplification diverged genetically from 
single copy isolates (appendix). Isolates with Pfplasmepsin2 
amplification obtained from Pailin in 2008 and 2011 
clustered separately from Pfplasmepsin2 amplified isolates 
obtained from Pailin and Phusing in 2015.
Discussion
Artemisinin resistance in P falciparum is evolving in the 
GMS. This study suggests that the previously described 
soft selective sweeps,9,10 which resulted from the multiple 
independent emergences of mutant PfKelch13 alleles, 
have now been superseded by hard selective sweeps by 
presumably fitter parasites. A single long haplotype 
PfKelch13 C580Y mutant parasite lineage has now spread 
across three countries. The dominant haplotype prevalent 
in 2014 and 2015 in both northeastern Thailand (Ubon 
and Srisaket provinces) and southern Laos (Champasak 
province) is the same as that observed from 2008 onwards 
in western Cambodia, indicating a common origin. 
Given the time course of artemisinin resistance in the 
region,4 and the low prevalence of falciparum malaria 
in northeastern Thailand 8 years ago, this suggests 
resistance spread from western Cambodia to Laos and 
Thailand, 
probably 
along 
with 
the 
cross-border 
movement of people (figure 2). Pfplasmepsin2 ampli-
fication, which is one of the genes associated with 
piperaquine resistance,16,17 has emerged on the back of 
the PfKelch13 C580Y mutation, and this multidrug-
resistant P falciparum lineage is spreading widely, 
causing high ACT failure rates. From 2008 to 2015 in 
Pailin, western Cambodia, where artemisinin resistance 
was first described, parasites containing the C580Y 
mutation have now replaced parasites containing other 
PfKelch13 
mutations, 
including 
the 
temporarily 
successful R539T haplotype. Malaria incidence has 
fallen, so this represents a relative rather than an absolute 
increase.
Earlier genetic epidemiological analysis from study sites 
in the GMS east of Bangkok showed clustering of long 
haplotypes around the PfKelch13 C580Y allele, consistent 
with a common origin in different sub 
populations across 
Cambodia and some samples from Vietnam and eastern 
Thailand.10 Our study uses micro 
satellite genotyping and 
shows further selection and reduction in variability over 
time, with a common origin of PfKelch13 C580Y parasite 
isolates sharing a similar long haplotype in all isolates 
surveyed from Cambodia and adjacent countries, by 
contrast with the high diversity in the flanking regions of 
parasites carrying wild-type PfKelch13. A similar trend, in 
which C580Y mutant parasites overtook other PfKelch13 
propeller region mutations, has been observed on the 
Thailand–Myanmar border.7 The C580Y mutation does 
not confer a higher level of artemisinin resistance than 
many other PfKelch13 mutations (including R539T), but 
this lineage appears to be fitter or more transmissible. 
PfKelch13 mutations are found throughout the malaria 
endemic world, but artemisinin resistance has emerged 
and spread only in the GMS. Genome-wide association 
studies have shown that in addition to the PfKelch13 
mutations, a combination of backbone mutations are 
closely linked to the artemisinin-resistant phenotype and 
are present in association with different PfKelch13 
variants.24 These other genetic changes presumably confer 
an additional fitness advantage, facilitating selection 
and spread.
The emergence and spread of piperaquine resistance in 
Cambodia is a sinister development. More than half of the 
parasite isolates obtained from Pailin in Cambodia and 
Phusing in nearby Thailand in 2015 also carried a marker 
for piperaquine resistance; gene amplification of the 
Pfplasmepsin2 genes on chromosome 14.16,17 Until 2016, 
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine was the first-line ACT in 
Cambodia, but its efficacy has decreased markedly 
since 2008.5,6,8,25 High treatment failure rates facilitate 
the spread of resistance. P falciparum isolates from 
northeastern Thailand also carried the piperaquine

A single artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum PfKelch13 C580Y lineage (K13) has spread over an arc involving 
Cambodia, Thailand, and Laos. Pfplasmepsin2 amplification (PM2), has emerged subsequently within this lineage.

resistance marker, yet first-line treatment there has been 
artesunate-mefloquine, which suggests recent impor-
tation rather than local selection. The Pfplasmepsin2 
amplified parasites all carried the same PfKelch13 C580Y 
long haplotype, but were less diverse than the 
Pfplasmepsin2 single copy isolates with this haplotype, 
which suggests that Pfplasmepsin2 amplification occurred 
after the selection of the successful PfKelch13 C580Y 
lineage.
A limitation of the study is that geographic spread to 
other areas of the GMS was not investigated. Assessment 
of parasite diversity was also compromised by the low 
prevalence now of wild-type PfKelch13 in some study 
sites. However, this does not challenge the main 
conclusion of the study: parasites originating from 
artemisinin resistance soft selective sweeps26 have been 
replaced by a single dominant genotype (a hard sweep) 
that is spreading widely. This change occurred previously 
with antifolate resistance in P falciparum.15 Pfdhfr mutant 
genotypes (including the triple 108, 51, and 59 genotype) 
emerged de novo on multiple occasions but over time a 
single triple genotype parasite lineage dominated in the 
GMS and this spread across continents.15 It is also 
possible that the dominant Pfcrt K76T genotype, 
conferring chloroquine resistance, was preceded by 
multiple soft sweeps.
The findings in this study have important implications 
for public health and containment strategies. Artemisinin 
resistance in this region was clearly a prelude to partner 
drug resistance. The combination of artemisinin and 
piperaquine resistance is now spreading quickly through-
out Cambodia. Fitter multidrug-resistant parasites are 
spreading throughout western Cambodia, southern Laos, 
and northeastern Thailand. This evidence reinforces the 
urgency for P falciparum elimination in areas of 
artemisinin 
and 
partner 
drug 
resistance 
since 
containment will become increasingly difficult as drug 
efficacy declines. Further spread of these successful 
multidrug resistant parasites through India to sub-
Saharan Africa would be a public health disaster. Border 
crossings between countries in the region are frequent, 
and mobile populations who carry parasites asympto-
matically are a likely source of transnational spread.27,28
In conclusion, this study shows that over a large area 
of the GMS multiple independently originating 
PfKelch13 mutant P falciparum parasites have been 
replaced by a single dominant long haplotype 
PfKelch13 C580Y mutant lineage. This mutant had its 
likely origin in western Cambodia, and then spread to 
northeastern Thailand and southern Laos. These 
dominant artemisinin-resistant parasites are developing 
resistance to the ACT partner drugs, and are causing 
high rates of malaria treatment failure. What appeared 
initially to be an unusual pattern of multiple events 
has transformed into a more familiar scenario in 
which successful closely genetically related malaria 
parasites, which are highly drug resistant, spread and 
threaten malaria control and elimination throughout 
the region and beyond.
