AbstrAct
background Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is prevalent 
in adolescence and adulthood and often persists. In 
contrast to other persistent musculoskeletal conditions, 
for which non-physical, psychological features are impli-
cated, PFP remains largely conceptualised in mechanical 
terms.
Aims To (1) identify whether the psychological 
characteristics of individuals with PFP differs from 
asymptomatic controls and (2) evaluate the correlations 
between psychological characteristics and PFP severity.
study design Systematic review
Methods A systematic review of the literature was 
conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. The 
Epidemiological Appraisal Instrument was used to 
evaluate quality. Studies measuring psychological 
constructs with patient-reported measures were 
included. Standardised mean differences were calculated 
and supported by narrative synthesis.
results Twenty-five studies were eligible. Quality results 
ranged from 28.3% to 61.7%. Psychological constructs 
were reported under four groupings: mental health, 
cognitive factors, behavioural factors and other factors. 
There is limited evidence of mental health and cognitive 
differences in some individuals with PFP. Features 
demonstrating linear correlations with pain and physical 
function included anxiety/depression, catastrophising, 
praying and hoping and pain-related fear.
conclusions Anxiety, depression, catastrophising 
and fear of movement may be elevated in individuals 
with PFP and correlate with pain and reduced physical 
function. These results derive from a limited number of 
studies. Future research should aim to evaluate if and 
how psychological factors contribute to PFP.
clinical relevance Patients are likely to benefit from 
clinician vigilance to the presence of psychological 
factors.
IntroductIon
Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is a prevalent muscu-
loskeletal condition1 2 that presents as an anterior 
knee pain provoked by physical activities that 
load/stress the patellofemoral joint.3 4 It is hetero-
geneous, presents throughout the lifespan5 and 
is often persistent.6 Research shows that 40% to 
57% of those receiving evidence-based treatments7 
experience unfavourable long-term outcomes.8 9 
Persistent PFP and poor long-term outcomes may 
impact negatively on social engagement and partic-
ipation in physical activities such as sports and 
occupational tasks.10
Growing evidence suggests that non-physical, 
 
psychological features play a role in persistent 
 
musculoskeletal pain. Factors such as pain-related 
fear, anxiety, depression, catastrophising and 
self-efficacy have been associated with pain11 and 
disability.12 13 They have also been identified as 
barriers to recovery14 and as factors that limit the 
potential for improvement with rehabilitation.15 As 
a result, presence of these features is often factored 
into treatment decision-making for other musculo-
skeletal conditions.16–19
As a persistent musculoskeletal condition that is 
no longer considered self-limiting,6 9 20 PFP may also 
be characterised by the coexistence of physical and 
non-physical features. If non-physical features can 
influence the outcomes of physical interventions, 
then further investigation into the non-physical 
features of PFP is essential. Ultimately, a better 
understanding of the non-physical features of PFP 
stands to enhance the outcomes of currently used 
physical interventions and expose other features at 
which management may be targeted or which may 
influence how a treatment is applied.
The aims of this systematic review were to (1) 
identify whether the psychological characteristics 
of individuals with PFP differ from that of asymp-
tomatic controls and (2) evaluate the correlation 
between psychological characteristics and measures 
of pain and physical function in individuals with 
PFP
.
Methods
The systematic review protocol was developed in 
accordance with the 2009 Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Anal-
yses (PRISMA) statement21 and prospectively 
registered 
with 
PROSPERO 
(Registration: 
CRD42016036379).
search strategy and data sources
A search using ‘patellofemoral pain’ OR ‘patellofem-
oral pain syndrome’ OR ‘anterior knee pain’ OR 
‘chondromalacia patellae’ was conducted. It was 
expected that this unrefined approach would yield 
high returns and would reduce the chance of lesser 
known psychological measurements being missed.
Eight electronic databases were searched (Cinahl, 
Cochrane library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PubMed, 
PEDro, 
PsycINFO, 
Scopus). 
Databases 
were 
searched by the first author (LM), with the final 
search conducted on the 13th of January 2016. Elec-
tronic results were followed by reference list checks 
and author searches. Published reports, conference 
abstracts and reference lists were also perused.
eligibility criteria
As an epidemiologically based review, the scope 
of included studies was purposefully broad. To be

 review
included, studies had to measure at least one psychological vari-
able using a patient-reported format in a cohort of individuals 
with PFP
. Studies were included that clearly defined diagnostic 
criteria for PFP
, the diagnostician or described the condition as 
‘PFP’. For studies that recruited mixed (symptomatic) popu-
lations, we included those for which data pertaining solely to 
individuals with PFP could be extracted.
Studies were excluded if they were case studies, published 
abstracts, non-published studies (eg, graduate theses) or non-pri-
mary literature (eg, systematic and narrative reviews).
study selection
Studies identified in database searches were exported to EndNote 
(X7.2.1). T
wo reviewers (LM, MM) independently evaluated 
titles and abstracts, and then full texts. Consensus meetings were 
held at each stage to determine progression to the next stage, 
and discrepancies were resolved by a third author (BV).
data extraction
Data extraction was completed independently by two reviewers 
(LM and MM) using a standardised spreadsheet. Data of interest 
included: (1) participant characteristics—source, sex, age, body 
mass index (BMI), education level, employment status, smoking 
status and activity levels; (2) PFP characteristics—diagnostic 
criteria, pain measure used, pain duration, pain severity, location 
of pain; and (3) psychological factors: measures used and results.
Methodological quality assessment
The methodological quality of each study was assessed inde-
pendently by two reviewers (LM, NC), one of who (NC) was 
blinded to journal, study title, authors and affiliations, using 
the Epidemiological Appraisal Instrument (EAI).22 As a general 
purpose appraisal instrument, the EAI can be used to evaluate 
intervention, cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies. 
With a total of 43 questions grouped into five sections, the EAI 
considers: (1) reporting; (2) participant/record selection; (3) 
measurement quality; (4) data analysis; and (5) generalisation 
of results. Items are answered ‘yes’ (2), ‘partial’ (1), ‘no’ (0), 
‘unable to determine’ (0) or, depending on study design, ‘not 
applicable’. To answer questions pertaining to covariates and 
cofounders, the review team selected, a priori, specific factors 
that the World Health Organisation has recognised as risks to 
mental health.23 These factors were age, sex, BMI, pain severity 
and duration, smoking, employment status, education level and 
activity level. Summary scores were expressed as a proportion 
of all items that were applicable. Methodological quality criteria 
were graded specific to the research question for this systematic 
review rather than for the general quality of each study and its 
original purpose. Thus, methodological quality scores presented 
are specific to this review and should not be interpreted in 
different contexts. In the absence of an absolute external refer-
ence, quartiles were used to express final quality rank. The first 
quartile (Q1) represents the lowest scoring papers and the fourth 
quartile (Q4) the highest.
data synthesis
Inter-rater reliability between methodological quality assessors 
was calculated in STATA V
.14.0 and presented as a κ Statistic. 
Inter-rater reliability was considered as poor (<0.00), slight 
(0.00–0.2), fair (0.21–0.4), moderate (0.41–0.6), substantial 
(0.61–0.8) or almost perfect (0.81–1.0)24 Psychological findings 
are presented under two headings that directly fulfil the review’s 
aims: (1) psychological characteristics of people with PFP and 
(2) correlations between psychological factors, PFP and phys-
ical function. Standardised mean differences (SMD) and 95% 
CI were calculated using Review Manager (RevMan) V
.5.3. The 
SMD results from negatively orientated measures (ones where 
a lower score represents poorer psychological health) were 
inverted so that all positive SMD meant the same thing; that is, 
higher positive SMD indicated poorer psychological health in 
the PFP group. An SMD greater or equal to 0.2 was considered 
small, greater or equal to 0.50, medium and greater or equal to 
0.80, large.25 Corresponding correlation coefficient indexes were 
0.10, 0.30 and 0.50, respectively.25 When only frequency data 
were available, risk ratios were calculated using RevMan V
.5.3. 
The above descriptives were used where meta-analyses were not 
possible. Where effect sizes could not be calculated (eg, lack of 
control group), raw data were tabulated and presented graph-
ically. Electronic searches were conducted to obtain normative 
data for comparisons.
results
study selection and design
The search yielded 10 617 studies. After removal of dupli-
cates, there were 6772 studies for title and abstract perusal. 
Fifty studies were eligible for full-text review, of which 25 
met the eligibility criteria and were included (figure 1). These, 
by design, comprised 16 case series and nine cohort studies. 
Comparative data were available in five instances, correla-
tive in nine, while the remaining 11 provided descriptive data 
(table 1).
Methodological quality assessment
Online supplementary file 1 contains full-quality appraisal results 
for all studies (itemised marking, the total percentage each study 
scored and an overall percentage of studies that addressed each 
criteria) along with a quartile table. With 879 agreed responses 
from 1075 items, the overall agreement between the two assessors 
was substantial (κ=0.75).24 The median methodological quality 
percentage score was 45.2% (IQR 37.1 to 51.5) the minimum 
was 28.3% and the maximum was 61.7%. Seven studies, scoring 
between 28.3% and 37.1% fell in the 1st quartile (Q1); six studies 
(score 40% to 45.2%) fell in the 2nd quartile (Q2); seven studies 
(score 46.7% to 51.5%) fell in the 3rd quartile (Q3); and five 
studies (score 51.6% to 61.7%) fell in the 4th quartile (Q4]. The 
reliability and validity of the psychological measures used were 
described and referenced in 12% (3/25) 
and 28% (7/25) of studies, 
respectively. When performing data analyses, 76% (19/25) of 
studies did not adjust for intrinsic factors (age, gender, BMI) and 
88% (22/25) did not adjust for extrinsic factors (smoking status, 
employment status, educational level, activity level). Five per cent 
(1/20) of studies reported psychological findings by PFP levels 
(severity and/or duration) and 4% (1/25) of studies reported 
psychological findings by age, sex, BMI, smoking, employment 
status, education level, activity level) subgroups.
Participant characteristics
Table 1 presents participant characteristics for all included 
studies. Across all studies, there were 1357 participants with 
PFP (891 women: 66%), with the mean (SD) age ranging from 
14.1 (1.38) 
to 46.6 (10.8) years old. Participants were sourced 
from clinical sites,26–42 athletics clubs and exercise programmes43 
44 and population-based cohorts.45 46 Five studies did not report 
participant sources.
The 349 healthy controls (168 women: 48%) came from 
student cohorts44–47 or from the local community.48 One study

PFP characteristics
Details relating to PFP characteristics, including duration, severity 
and measurement tools are presented in table 1. Criteria used

Psychological factors
Eighteen different instruments were used to measure psycho-
logical constructs, the results of which are presented under 
four construct groupings; mental health, cognitive factors, 
behavioural factors and other psychological factors (table 2). 
Mental health included measures of depression, anxiety and 
general mental health.51 In line with previously used cognitive 
and behavioural groupings,52
cognitive factors were coping strategies and catastrophising, 
whereas behavioural factors were dependency, fear of movement 
(kinesiophobia) and fear avoidance. Other psychological factors 
include measures of emotional well-being and social aspects that 
did not fit within the other factor groupings.
The most commonly used psychological measure was the 
Short Form-36 health survey Mental Health Component 
(SF-36 MHC).26–28 31–35 40 43 49 50 Other instruments measuring 
constructs of mental health that were used more than once

Psychological characteristics of people with PFP (aim 1)
Meta-analysis was not possible because of heterogeneity of 
the included studies. T
wenty studies reported data from PFP 
cohorts without asymptomatic comparator groups. These data 
are presented in online supplementary file 3 and are supported 
by online supplementary files 4 and 5. The following narrative 
synthesis focuses on data obtained from the five case-control 
studies, which enables comparison between PFP and controls 
(aim 1). It also highlights results from single-group studies inves-
tigating correlations between PFP and psychological factors.
Mental health
General mental health, measured with the SF-36 MHC (vitality, 
social function, role emotional and mental health sub-scales) was 
significantly lower in a group of adults with PFP (SMD 1.21; 
95% 
CI 0.81 to 1.62) (Q3).27
Anxiety and/or depression was compared with pain-free 
controls in three studies. Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 scores 
revealed significantly higher levels for one adult group with 
PFP (SMD 1.03; 95% 
CI 0.43 to 1.64) (Q3)48 but no significant 
differences between-group scores across the different Karolinska 
scales of personality in a separate study (Q1).47 In the case where 
only frequency data were available, a group of adolescents with 
PFP had 3.00 (95% 
CI 0.34 to 26.45) times the risk of anxiety/
depression than controls (Q4).46
Cognitive factors
Several coping strategies demonstrated significant between-
group differences. One student cohort with PFP group found 
it harder to divert their attention (SMD 0.40; 95% CI 0.02 
to 0.82) than those who were PFP free (Q3).44 In a different 
student cohort, levels of catastrophising were significantly 
higher in those with PFP (SMD 1.07; 95% CI 0.41 to 1.74) 
(Q4).46
Behavioural factors
Levels of dependency, measured with Carlsson’s Dependency 
Scale were not significantly different between those with and 
without PFP (SMD 0.10; 95% 
CI −0.57 to 0.78) (Q1).47
Personality and other psychosocial factors
All studies in this section had pain-free comparators. No signif-
icant differences were found between PFP and pain-free group 
scores of the Schalling-Sifneos Alexithymia Scale-Revised (SMD 
0.24; 95% 
CI −0.44 to 0.91) (Q1).47 Stress, measured with 
Carlsson’s Stress Scale, was significantly higher in a group of 
adults with PFP (SMD 0.72; 95% 
CI 0.03 to 1.42) (Q1).47 From 
the Coop Wonca Chart subscale, adults with PFP reported expe-
riencing significantly more emotional problems (SMD 0.89; 
95% 
CI 0.30 to 1.49) than PFP-free controls (Q3).48
correlation between psychological factors, PFP and physical 
function (aim 2)
Mental health
Small to medium correlations (ranging from r=0.13 to r=0.47) 
were found between all sub-scales of the SF-36 MHC and the 
Thai (Q1),26 Chinese (Q1)28 and Persian (Q2)35 versions of the 
Kujala Patellofemoral Scale. The SF-36 sub-scales of ‘social 
function’ and ‘mental health’ both demonstrated small correla-
tions with the Functional Index questionnaire, r=0.23 and 
r=0.15, respectively (Q3).34 All SF-36 subscales apart from role 
emotional (r=0.08) demonstrated small correlations with the 
Modified Functional Index Questionnaire (Q3).34
When measured with the Beck Anxiety Inventory (Q4)36 
and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (Q2),30 anxiety 
was correlated with pain (r=0.34 and r=0.46, respectively) 
and with physical function (r=0.45 and r=0.57, respectively). 
Depression was also correlated with pain (r=0.44) and physical 
function (r=−0.61) (Q2).30 When measured over a 6-month 
period, improvement change scores in pain and physical func-
tion were associated with changes in anxiety (r=0.41 and 
r=0.43, respectively) and depression (r=0.54 and r=0.59, 
respectively) (Q2).29
Cognitive factors
Catastrophising and the coping strategy of ‘praying and hoping’ 
both correlated to pain (r=0.43 and r=0.35, respectively) and 
physical function (r=−0.53 and r=−0.38, respectively) (Q2).30 
When measured over a 6-month period, improvement change 
scores in pain and physical function were correlated with reduced 
catastrophising (r=0.59 and r=0.57, respectively) (Q2).29
Behavioural factors
Fear of movement (Q2)30 and the fear-avoidance beliefs relating 
to physical activity (FABQ-PA) and work (FABQ-W) (Q4)36 were 
all associated with pain (r=0.26, r=0.31 and r=0.37, respec-
tively) and physical function (r=0.26, r=0.31 and r=0.37, 
respectively). When measured over a 2-month follow-up period, 
pain reductions and physical functional improvements were 
associated with reduced FABQ-PA scores (r=0.51 and r=0.57, 
respectively). But only pain reductions were associated with 
reduced FABQ-W scores (r=0.30) (Q4).37
dIscussIon
This systematic review identified psychological characteristics 
that differed between individuals with PFP and asymptomatic 
controls in several cohorts. Further, according to our second 
aim, we found linear correlations between some psychological 
characteristics and measures of pain and physical function in 
individuals with PFP
.
Psychological characteristics in individuals with PFP
Four case-control studies report evidence of abnormal psycho-
logical features in those with PFP
. Specifically, general mental 
health was worse;27 48 adolescents catastrophised more that 
PFP-free counterparts;46 and an active group employed different 
coping strategies.44 Other results suggestive of elevated scores on 
tests of psychological features were: high levels of fear avoidance 
in 26% of an adolescent cohort;39 levels of anxiety/depression 
in Danish adolescents (12%–15%)46 above that reported in 
normative data for Danish school-aged children (8.8%);53 and 
a study from the UK38 reporting a greater prevalence of anxiety/
depressive symptoms (26%) than that recorded for the general 
population by the Office of National Statistics (19%).54
Several studies reported no evidence of elevated non-physical 
characteristics in PFP
. One case-control study found no differ-
ence in levels of anxiety/depression between groups with and 
without PFP
.47 Single-group studies also reported mean anxiety 
and depression levels that were not abnormal;42 mean anxiety 
and depression levels41 below that of a national normative 
dataset;55 and SF-36 MHC results that, when compared with 
normative equivalents, demonstrate normal mental health in 
individuals with PFP

 review
In summary, there were four case-control studies that found 
psychological differences between PFP and control partici-
pants, compared with one that did not. The four studies that 
found differences were in the higher quality rating (Q3;27 44 48 
Q446) while the one that found no change rated poorly (Q147). 
Supporting comparative data were three high-rating single-group 
studies (Q3;37 38 Q445),demonstrating elevated psychological 
factors compared with six single-group studies that found no 
difference in measures. Of the latter, four rated poorly (Q1;26 28 42 
Q235) and two rated highly Q3;34 Q441). Thus, many of these 
findings suggest that coping strategies including catastroph-
ising may differ in those with PFP
, though the clinical relevance 
of the size of this difference is yet to be determined. Findings 
also suggest that anxiety/depression and fear avoidance may be 
elevated, especially in adolescents. These results derive from a 
disparate group of studies that use a wide variety of psycho-
logical measures. Sample sizes were, for the most part, small, 
which may explain why some studies failed to find evidence of 
abnormal non-physical features. The small samples also prevent 
accurate estimation of the prevalence of non-physical features 
in PFP
.
correlation between psychological factors, PFP and physical 
function
This review revealed several non-physical features that are 
correlated with PFP in a linear manner. As single mental health 
constructs, anxiety and depression demonstrated moderate-to-
large correlation with pain and physical function.29 30 36 37 All 
studies that used the SF-36 MHC only evaluated relationships 
with physical function and all found small-to-moderate correla-
tions at best.26 28 34 35
Beyond mental health, catastrophising29 30 and pain-related 
fear29 30 36 37 were the cognitive and behavioural factors, respec-
tively, that demonstrated the strongest and most consistent 
correlation with both pain and physical function. Catastroph-
ising and fear avoidance beliefs have previously been described 
as the cognitive and behavioural determinants of the pain experi-
ence.56 It remains unknown whether the experience of pain and 
the inability to perform physical tasks lead to the development 
of psychological problems, or whether psychological features 
influence pain and function through mechanisms such as effects 
on endogenous pain modulation, individual resilience and the 
motivation needed to cope with the symptoms of PFP
. Longi-
tudinal research is required to study these potential temporal 
relationships.
comparison with non-physical characteristics in other knee 
conditions
A number of systematic reviews have explored the relation-
ship between psychological factors and short-, medium- and 
long-term postoperative pain following total knee arthro-
plasty. The psychological factors identified therein included 
catastrophising,57–61 depression58–60 and anxiety.60 In other knee 
conditions, psychological factors also seem to share a rela-
tionship with function. Higher levels of exercise adherence, 
higher perceived rehabilitation effort and greater rates of home 
exercise completion have been found in patients with greater 
general self-efficacy following ACL reconstruction.62 Recog-
nising the similarities in psychological factors between these 
knee conditions and PFP provide support for consideration of 
non-physical factors in addition to mechanically focused PFP 
management strategies.
Implications for clinicians who are managing PFP
PFP and low back pain (LBP) are similar from several perspec-
tives. Both conditions can stem from insidious roots, limit physical 
function and persist. In both instances, the cause of pain can be 
hard to define and the pathway from acute pain to chronicity 
poorly understood. They differ in terms of structure, anatomical 
region and depth of investigation of involvement of psychological 
features of the conditions. Drawing from LBP research, subgroups 
that demonstrate the highest levels of psychological impairment 
are those with the highest pain intensities, the greatest disability 
and the longest pain duration.63–65 Psychological factors also act 
as significant barriers to home exercise programme adherence,66 
influence the transition from persistent to chronic widespread 
pain67 and increase healthcare usage.68 69
Facing a growing literature base implicating non-physical 
features in the development and maintenance of persistent 
musculoskeletal pain, clinicians who assess and treat PFP should 
screen for their presence. Generic instruments, such as the short-
form Orebro Musculoskeletal Pain Questionnaire,70 are simple 
to implement and can be completed early in the consultation 
process. If further investigation is merited, concise assessment 
of individual psychological constructs can be conducted using 
the instruments highlighted in this review (eg, fear of movement 
with the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia).71
Future research
The identification of differences in psychological factors between 
individuals with PFP and controls, as well as relationships 
with pain and physical function, suggests that there might be 
subgroups of PFP that require different treatment approaches. 
Three studies in this review attempted to subgroup partici-
pants. One took a cross-sectional approach to identify physical 
phenotypes38 and one identified a range of physical measures 
that may be potential risk factors for PFP development.44 The 
third applied a treatment algorithm that first identified and 
directed treatment according to the results of a fear-avoidance 
beliefs assessment.39 In the latter, a comparator group receiving 
usual care was lacking, but tailored treatment produced clinically 
significant physical functional improvements (Anterior Knee 
Pain Scale scores) for 100% of participants and clinically signifi-
cant reductions in pain severity for 33%. Although the potential 
benefits of subgrouping people with PFP to guide treatment 
remain relatively unknown, these results provide a stimulus for 
further studies. This includes further comparison of psycholog-
ical factors between those with and without PFP
, psychometric 
evaluation of psychological measures used in PFP groups and 
consistent use of recommended measures.
strengths and limitations
This review has attempted to address the complex topic of 
non-physical features of PFP
. The overall results are derived, in 
many cases, from a disparate group of studies without PFP-free 
comparators that were too diverse for data pooling. The wide 
range of psychological measures used also made the compiling 
and comparing of the results challenging. For most studies, 
investigation of psychological factors was not a primary aim, 
and this reflects in the generally low EAI quality ratings. The 
wide range of study designs made selection of an appropriate 
quality appraisal tool difficult. While comprehensive enough 
to evaluate the range of studies in this review (cohort and 
case series), the EAI did not evaluate the quality of specific 
study design analyses. The potential to define, classify and select

psychological measures for analysis also proved challenging and 
needs consideration when drawing inferences from the findings.
conclusIon
This systematic review has demonstrated that anxiety, depres-
sion, catastrophising and pain-related fear may be elevated in 
individuals with PFP
. It has also identified linear correlation 
between PFP-related symptoms and psychological factors such as 
catastrophising and pain-related fear. These findings are derived 
from studies with relatively small sample sizes, few of which 
included healthy control groups for comparison. Large case-con-
trol studies are needed to confirm the presence and prevalence 
of non-physical features.

Key messages
What is already known on this subject?
 
► Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is a highly prevalent musculoskel-
etal condition that can be challenging to manage.
 
► PFP is usually considered in a biomechanical paradigm.
 
►
Non-physical, psychological factors are increasingly recognised 
for their role in other persistent musculoskeletal pain conditions.
What are the new findings?
 
► Some mental health and cognitive profiles were different in 
those with PFP compared with asymptomatic controls.
 
► A range of mental health, cognitive and behavioural factors 
were correlated with pain and physical function.
 
►
Few studies have compared psychological profiles between 
those with and without PFP, and none have used the same 
measure.
