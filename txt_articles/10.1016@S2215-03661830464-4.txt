Summary
Background Insomnia disorder is the second most prevalent mental disorder, and it is a primary risk factor for 
depression. Inconsistent clinical and biomarker findings in patients with insomnia disorder suggest that heterogeneity 
exists and that subtypes of this disease remain unrecognised. Previous top-down proposed subtypes in nosologies 
have had insufficient validity. In this large-scale study, we aimed to reveal robust subtypes of insomnia disorder by use 
of data-driven analyses on a multidimensional set of biologically based traits.
Methods In this series of studies, we recruited participants from the Netherlands Sleep Registry, a database of 
volunteers aged 18 years or older, who we followed up online to survey traits, sleep, life events, and health history with 
34 selected questionnaires of which participants completed at least one. We identified insomnia disorder subtypes by 
use of latent class analyses. We evaluated the value of our identified subtypes of insomnia disorder by use of a second, 
non-overlapping cohort who were recruited through a newsletter that was emailed to a new sample of Netherlands 
Sleep Registry participants, and by assessment of within-subject stability over several years of follow-up. We 
extensively tested the clinical validity of these subtypes for the development of sleep complaints, comorbidities 
(including depression), and response to benzodiazepines; in two subtypes of insomnia disorder, we also assessed the 
clinical relevance of these subtypes by use of an electroencephalogram biomarker and the effectiveness of cognitive 
behavioural therapy. To facilitate implementation, we subsequently constructed a concise subtype questionnaire and 
we validated this questionnaire in the second, non-overlapping cohort.
Findings 4322 Netherlands Sleep Registry participants completed at least one of the selected questionnaires, a 
demographic questionnaire, and an assessment of their Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) between March 2, 2010, and 
Oct 28, 2016. 2224 (51%) participants had probable insomnia disorder, defined as an ISI score of at least 10, and 
2098 (49%) participants with a lower ISI score served as a control group. With a latent class analysis of the 
questionnaire responses of 2224 participants, we identified five novel insomnia disorder subtypes: highly distressed, 
moderately distressed but reward sensitive (ie, with intact responses to pleasurable emotions), moderately distressed 
and reward insensitive, slightly distressed with high reactivity (to their environment and life events), and slightly 
distressed with low reactivity. In a second, non-overlapping replication sample of 251 new participants who were 
assessed between June 12, 2017, and Nov 26, 2017, five subtypes were also identified to be optimal. In both the 
development sample and replication sample, each participant was classified as having only one subtype with high 
posterior probability (0·91–1·00). In 215 of the original sample of 2224 participants with insomnia who were 
reassessed 4·8 (SD 1·6) years later (between April 13, 2017, and June 21, 2017), the probability of maintaining their 
original subtype was 0·87, indicating a high stability of the classification. We found differences between the identified 
subtypes in developmental trajectories, response to treatment, the presence of an electroencephalogram biomarker, 
and the risk of depression that was up to five times different between groups, which indicated a clinical relevance of 
these subtypes.
Interpretation High-dimensional data-driven subtyping of people with insomnia has addressed an unmet need to 
reduce the heterogeneity of insomnia disorder. Subtyping facilitates identification of the underlying causes of 
insomnia, development of personalised treatments, and selection of patients with the highest risk of depression for 
inclusion in trials regarding prevention of depression.

Introduction
Insomnia is a common health problem; a third of the 
population report sleep complaints and about 10% of the 
population meet the diagnostic criteria for insomnia 
disorder,1,2 making it the second most prevalent mental 
disorder.3 Despite the high prevalence and considerable 
heritability of insomnia4 and the identification of genes 
that confer an associated risk of insomnia,5,6 it has been 
difficult to characterise insomnia consistently with respect 
to cognition,7 mood,8 family history,9 history of life events,10

personality,11 polysomnography,12 sleep microstructure,13 
and brain imaging.14 Such inconsistencies suggest unrec­
ognised subtypes of insomnia disorder and stall progress 
in our understanding of its underlying mech 
anisms, 
with which we could improve interventions. Subtypes of 
insomnia disorder that were previously proposed top­
down15–18 predominantly focused on sleep­related character­
istics (such as sleep­onset insomnia), had low reliability,15,16 
and were discarded from major nosologies.17,18
However, we suspected that clearer subtypes of 
insomnia disorder might emerge if they were developed 
bottom­up and data­driven, with a multidimensional set 
of stable, biologically based non­sleep characteristics 
that are relevant to insomnia.19 Such a wider perspective 
on discriminating characteristics has been shown to be 
important in other disorders. For example, subtyping 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder according to 
temperament trait dimensions explained more of its 
heterogeneity than previous nosological criteria.20 It is 
conceivable that insomnia disorder could similarly 
represent a heterogeneous group of patients in whom 
different underlying mechanisms are reflected in 
biologically based traits that lead to indistinguishable 
sleep complaints. Finding insomnia disorder subtypes 
would then require inclusion of traits that might only 
indirectly relate to sleep but can be highly relevant to 
insomnia, such as hyperarousal, personality, and mood 
traits.5,6,19
The biological basis of traits related to insomnia 
(appendix pp 20–28)19 makes it conceivable that several 
specific combinations of traits can be unfavourable for 
sleep regulation. Our previous genome­wide association 
studies5,6 indicated that insomnia disorder is genetically 
more closely related to attributes associated with mood, 
personality, 
and 
wellbeing 
than 
to 
sleep­related 
phenotypes. We therefore aimed to investigate whether 
insomnia disorder presents as different subtypes that are 
reflected in a multivariate pattern of stable characteristics, 
such as life history, trait positive and negative affect, and 
personality. 
Methods
Study design and participants
We used data provided by participants from the 
Netherlands Sleep Registry (NSR), an online platform and 
linked database that extensively surveys sleep, personality 
and affect traits, life events, and health conditions.19 NSR 
volunteers are recruited via media, advertisements, and 
flyers that are distributed at health­care institutions and 
conventions. Recruitment communications for the NSR 
stress the need for volunteers who cover the spectrum 
of those who sleep well to those who sleep poorly. As a 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Clinical and biomarker findings on insomnia disorder show 
inconsistencies across patients and studies, and this 
heterogeneity is suggested to be caused by unrecognised 
subtypes. Subtypes of insomnia disorder have previously been 
proposed top-down. It was presumed that these subtypes 
would differ with respect to stable sleep-related characteristics. 
Unfortunately, such subtypes had insufficient reliability and 
validity, so heterogeneity still prevails. No previous study 
investigated whether subtypes can be revealed using a 
high-dimensional data-driven approach, including biologically 
based traits that could more indirectly be related to insomnia. 
We searched PubMed for work published before Feb 19, 2018, 
with the search terms “insomnia AND data-driven AND 
subtype”, which revealed only two papers. One of these papers 
was a study report that included insomnia as a dimension to 
subtype 203 patients with major depressive disorder. The other 
paper was our theoretical systematic review on variables of 
relevance in a high-dimensional data-driven approach to find 
subtypes of insomnia.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, our study represents the first identification 
of five novel and robust subtypes of insomnia disorder and the 
first demonstration of the usefulness of these subtypes in 
reducing clinical and biomarker heterogeneity. We used a 
high-dimensional data-driven analysis of 34 biologically based 
traits that were assessed by questionnaires in a large sample 
(4322 participants) among which 2224 participants had 
probable insomnia disorder. We also developed and validated a 
more concise Insomnia Type Questionnaire with the most 
discriminating 200 of the original 523 questions, representing 
17 of the original 26 characteristics, to reliably assess subtypes 
in an independent sample. After a follow up of 4·8 
(range 0·5–7·0) years, there was a probability of 0·87 that 
participants would maintain their original subtype, which was 
in sharp contrast to the low stability of previous subtypes that 
were suggested in top-down studies (eg, a third of participants 
maintained their subtype for 4 months). In derived and 
independent samples, we validated the clinical relevance of our 
identified subtypes by identification of subtype differences in 
developmental trajectories of sleep complaints, health risks, 
response to pharmacological and non-pharmacological 
treatments, and a neurophysiological biomarker.
Implications of all the available evidence
Marked subtype differences in the risk of depression in people 
with insomnia could enable selection of high-risk individuals 
for preventive interventions by use of the Insomnia Type 
Questionnaire that we developed, which includes automated 
scoring. By reducing previously unrecognised heterogeneity, 
subtyping will facilitate identification of biomarkers, 
elucidation of the mechanisms of insomnia, and development 
of personalised treatments for insomnia disorder. Subtyping is 
reliable and can be accomplished in large populations by use of 
the internet.

result, participants in the NSR database represent a 
uniform distribution with respect to the severity of 
insomnia: 
38% 
of 
participants 
have 
insomnia, 
29% of participants have subclinical insomnia, and 33% 
of participants have clinical insomnia.21 The only inclusion 
criterion was an age of 18 years or older. Participants 
completed a variable number of randomly selected 
questionnaires (of 34 questionnaires) at their convenience, 
resulting in a varying number and set of completed 
questionnaires between participants. Those with an 
insomnia severity index (ISI) score of at least 10 were 
included as cases with probable insomnia disorder; 
participants with an ISI score of less than 10 were included 
as controls. Among the participants with probable 
insomnia disorder, we invited a randomly drawn subset by 
email to participate in a longitudinal follow up. 
Additionally, new NSR participants were recruited by 
newsletter for validation in a second, non­overlapping 
cohort. The Medical Ethical Committee of the Academic 
Medical Centre of Amsterdam and the Central Committee 
on Research Involving Human Subjects approved of 
implicit informed consent.
Model development
Characteristics that were relevant to insomnia were 
first identified by a systematic review19 and an assessment 
of genetic correlations.5,6 Sufficient data were available for 
34 characteristics, each representing a questionnaire sum 
score, that covered features of life history, fatigue and 
arousal, personality, mood, and happiness, among others 
(appendix p 29). To prevent multicollinearity, we selected 
only the characteristics that had the lowest median 
correlation with each of the other characteristics, 
preserving 26 characteristics for analyses. The preserved 
characteristics and observed score ranges are shown in 
the appendix (p 32).
To identify subtypes among the patients with insomnia 
disorder, we chose a model­based unsupervised clustering 
technique—latent class analysis—because this approach 
can handle missing data, include variables that are 
measured on different scales, and classify new patients 
(appendix p 2). To determine the most probable number of 
subtypes, we increased the number of classes stepwise, and 
we selected the model that minimised the Bayesian 
information criterion. Any participant who completed even 
only one characteristic questionnaire is of value to estimate 
the latent class model, because even one observation carries 
information on the observed range of that characteristic. 
However, a profile of several characteristics is required to 
subtype an individual, and the availability of only a few 
characteristics is insufficient to identify the subtype profile 
to which an individual belongs. Therefore, we evaluated the 
quality of the model on a subsample of 1046 individuals 
who completed at least ten and up to 26 questionnaires, 
each  representing independent characteristics (appendix 
p 16). Details on model estimation, evaluation, and 
assumptions are shown in the appendix (p 2).
For 
multivariate 
visualisation 
of 
subtypes, 
we 
standardised each individual characteristic score to the 
corresponding distribution of scores in the control group. 
The values of positive characteristics (such as wellbeing) 
were reverse coded and renamed (eg, reduced wellbeing), 
such that higher values would uniformly indicate higher 
general distress. To quantify the effect sizes of group 
differences, we computed Cohen’s d, often labelled 
small (0·2), medium (0·5), and large (0·8).22
To facilitate implementation, we used a regression 
with least absolute shrinkage and selection (lasso) 
regularisation to select a subset of characteristics that 
still accurately predicted class membership, from which 
we developed the Insomnia Type Questionnaire (ITQ; 
appendix pp 4, 37).
Model validation
We recruited a new, non­overlapping validation sample 
of people with probable insomnia disorder (with an ISI 
score21 of at least 10) through the NSR. With this sample, 
we validated the robustness of the number of classes by 
use of a latent class analysis and again selected the model 
that minimised the Bayesian information criterion. 
Moreover, we verified the use of the ITQ in subdividing 
these patients into subtypes. Details on regularisation 
and ITQ construction are shown in the appendix (p 4).
Finally, to validate the trait­like stability of subtype 
classification, we assessed the consistency of subtype 
membership over a maximum of 7 years by use of a 
latent transition analysis (appendix p 5) in a proportion 
of the original participants. 
Clinical validation
After the subtypes of insomnia disorder were found and 
validated, we extensively investigated clinical relevance of 
these subtypes for the developmental trajectories of sleep 
complaints, current comorbidities, risk of depression, 
and response to benzodiazepine intake. We also 
investigated the clinical relevance of two subtypes for an 
electroencephalogram biomarker and the effectiveness 
of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for insomnia 
(appendix p 16).
To assess clinical relevance in NSR participants, we first 
used χ² tests to evaluate differences in the develop 
mental 
trajectories of sleep complaints across the lifespan 
between the subtypes, and we used Fisher’s exact tests for 
differences in comorbid sleep­disorders, lifetime and 
current risk of depression, and other comorbidities.
Second, a subsample of NSR participants with insomnia 
disorder used five­point bipolar Likert­type scales to rate 
whether difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining 
sleep, early morning awakening, and fatigue were 
worsened or improved after incidental benzodiazepine 
use the preceding night, relative to their usual severity. 
Ratings by subtype were compared with F tests and t tests.
Third, in a separate sample, we investigated the subtype­
dependent effects of 4 weeks of online CBT for insomnia

on the ISI score of people diagnosed with insomnia 
disorder.17,18 ITQ­based subtyping identified sufficient 
participants of subtype 2 and subtype 4. We used mixed 
effect models to compare treatment effects in this sample.
Finally, as a preliminary illustration of the potential of 
subtyping in finding clinically relevant biomarkers and 
clues to differential underlying brain mechanisms, 
we subtyped volunteers of an independent study on 
electroencephalogram event­related potentials (ERPs). 
Among participating patients diagnosed with insomnia 
disorder,17,18 only those with insomnia disorder subtypes 2 
and 4 were sufficiently represented (defined as more than 
ten participants per group) for reliable ERP averages. The 
ERP results of these participants were compared with 
those of controls without sleep complaints. In a so­called 
auditory oddball task, volunteers listen to repeated 
standard tones and occasional tones of a deviating pitch. 
Electroencephalograms are simultaneously recorded, 
which allows for an evaluation of trait­like brain responses 
that reflect information­processing aspects such as 
adaptation and attention. Artifact­free ERPs at the 
Pz location of the 10­20 system of electrodes that were 
referenced to both mastoids were averaged over 
170 standard tones and 30 deviating tones. We used 
cluster­based random permutation tests to evaluate the 
significance of group differences across the ERP curve, 
covering early sensory responses, a mid­latency indicator 
of adaptation, attention, and salience (determined by the 
P300 potential amplitude), and a late indicator of 
emotional relevance (determined by the late positive 
potential amplitude).23
Statistical analysis
Latent class analysis and latent transition analysis were 
done with Latent GOLD version 5.0. Other analyses used 
the R (version 3.2.4) packages effsize, leaps, glmnet, and 
stabs, SPSS (version 23.0), and MLwiN version 2.02. The 
analysis scheme and corresponding subsamples are 
shown in the appendix (p 16). 
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the report. The corresponding author had full access to 
all the data in the study and had final responsibility for 
the decision to submit for publication.
Results
All questionnaires (appendix p 29) were completed 
online between March 2, 2010, and Nov 26, 2017
. Face­to­
face interviews in a subsample of 244 participants were 
conducted between Jan 9, 2012, and Sept 30, 2016, at the 
Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience (Amsterdam, 
The Netherlands). Data collected between March 2, 2010, 
and Oct 28, 2016, in participants of the Netherlands 
Sleep Registry (NSR) were used (figure 1). Of the 
13 565 
people 
who 
signed 
up 
for 
the 
NSR, 
4322 participants completed at least one of the 
34 included questionnaires, in addition to a demo­
graphics questionnaire and an assessment of their ISI. 
2224 (51%) participants fulfilled the criterion of an 
ISI score21 of at least 10 for probable insomnia disorder 
in community samples and were included in the latent 
class analysis. 2098 (49%) participants had an ISI score 
of less than 10 and served as controls. The validity of the 
ISI cut­off was confirmed in a subsample of 244 (11%) of 
the participants, who were also diagnosed in a face­to­
face interview with DSM­5 criteria.17 195 (80%) of these 
participants were diagnosed with insomnia disorder 
with these criteria, of whom 185 (76%) had an ISI of at 
least 10 (sensitivity 94·9%); of the 49 (20%) participants 
without this diagnosis, 41 (17%) had an ISI of less than 
10 (specificity 83·7%). In absence of face­to­face

diagnosis of the other participants, our definition 
of insomnia disorder, for brevity, should be read as 
probable insomnia disorder, as suggested by the severity 
of insomnia symptoms. On April 13, 2017, a newsletter 
was sent among registered NSR users who opted­in for 
communications, to collect follow­up data, which were 
collected between April 13, 2017, and June 21, 2017
. Of the 
1046 participants who were originally assessed for 
at least ten characteristics (ie, with at least ten 
questionnaires), 831 (79%) participants were lost to 
follow­up and 215 (21%) participants were assessed in 
the follow­up latent transition analysis.

The 2224 participants with probable insomnia disorder 
had a mean age of 51·1 (SD 13·7) years and 1726 (78%) 
participants with probable insomnia disorder were 
female (table 1). 2098 control participants (with an 
ISI<10) had a mean age of 47·2 (15·8) years, and 
1558 (74%) control participants were female.
With a minimal Bayesian information criterion, we 
found that a five­class model was optimal among the 
2224 participants whose responses were used to estimate 
the model. To interpret the estimated model, we used 
this model to subtype the 1046 (47%) participants who 
completed at least ten and up to 26 questionnaires 
(figure 2; appendix p 34). Most participants were uniquely 
assigned to only one of the five subtypes, as indicated by 
high posterior probabilities (0·91–0·99) and a low 
misclassification estimate (13%; appendix p 35). The 
demographics, insomnia characteristics, and comorbid­
ities of the 1046 people with insomnia who completed at 
least ten questionnaires are shown in table 1.
Their multivariate profiles of the group means of 
characteristics (life history and affect and personality 
traits) for each subtype, ranked clockwise according to 
subtype­explained variance (from 41% variance in 
negative affect to 15% variance in behavioural activation), 
are shown in figure 3, and all 26 characteristics are 
shown in the appendix (p 19). The diameter of the 
profiles represents the overall level of burdensome 
characteristics—ie, high for one subtype, moderate for 
two subtypes, and slight for two subtypes. The profiles 
also discriminate between subtypes by their multivariate 
fingerprint shape.
Among the 1046 people with insomnia who completed 
at least ten questionnaires, 200 (19%) participants were 
classified in subtype 1, which indicated high general 
distress (figure 3). The three characteristics that deviated 
most markedly from control group participants 
concerned high pre­sleep arousal (Cohen’s d=2·55) and 
negative affect (d=2·31) and reduced subjective happiness 
(d=2·15; p<0·0001 for all three). Most other characteristics 
differed by more than 1 standard deviation, except for 
reduced positive rumination (d=0·41; p<0·0001) and 
reduced experience of pleasure (d=0·31; p=0·0016), 
which were within 0·5 standard deviations of the control 
group results. Subtype 1 can be termed highly distressed 
insomnia disorder.
323 (31%) participants were classified in subtype 2 and 
153 (15%) participants were classified in subtype 3; both 
showed moderate general distress but could be 
distinguished by their profile (figure 3). For subtype 2, pre­
sleep arousal (d=1·57), insomnia response to stress 
(d=1·38), and negative affect (d=1·12) deviated most 
markedly from control participants (p<0·0001 for all 
three). Relative to the overall moderate general distress, 
the high arousal and response to stress of subtype 2 
appears like the disorder that is conventionally referred to 
as psychophysiological insomnia. Subtype 2 participants 
did not show particularly low positive affect (d=0·06; p=0·3), 
positive rumination (d=–0·13; p=0·06), or experience of 
pleasure (d=–0·36; p<0·0001); all of these findings were 
within 0·5 standard deviations of the results of control 
participants, and even appeared more favourable regarding 
positive rumination and experience of pleasure.  Subtype 2 
can be termed moderately distressed, reward­sensitive 
insomnia disorder.
By contrast, subtype 3 is primarily characterised by 
reduced 
positivity. 
Specifically, 
reduced 
subjective 
happiness (d=1·89), positive affect (d=1·34), positive 
rumination (d=1·18), and experience of pleasure (d=1·00)

all deviated from the findings in control participants 
by more than 1 standard deviation (p<0·0001 for all four). 
Positive rumination and experience of pleasure were more 
reduced in subtype 3 than in any other subtype. Subtype 3 
also differed markedly from controls (d=1·42; p<0·0001), 
but not from subtype 2 (d=0·17; p=0·12), regarding pre­
sleep arousal. Subtype 3 can be termed moderately 
distressed, reward­insensitive insomnia disorder. The 
characteristics that distinguish between the similarly 
distressed subtypes 2 and 3 most are more strongly 
reduced positive affect (d=1·55) and more strongly 
reduced positive rumination (d=1·55) in subtype 3 relative 
to subtype 2 (both p<0·0001).
209 (20%) participants were classified in subtype 4, and 
161 (15%) participants were classified in subtype 5; 
participants in both subtypes showed low general distress 
but can be distinguished by their profiles (figure 3). 
Participants in subtype 4 showed a longer duration of 
insomnia response to life events (d=0·94) and more 
frequent childhood trauma (d=0·82) and fatigue (d=0·60) 
relative to controls (from which they differed by >0·5 of a 
standard deviation; p<0·0001 for all three). Subtype 4 can 
be termed slightly distressed, high reactive insomnia 
disorder because of the long­lasting insomnia response 
after a life event.
By contrast, participants classified in subtype 5 scored 
about 0·5 of a standard deviation lower than control 
participants on both the duration (d=–0·64) and severity 
(d=–0·51) of insomnia response to life events, on 
childhood trauma (d=–0·41), and on rumination (d=–0·55; 
p<0·0001 for all three). However, relative to the overall low 
level of distress in participants classified in subtype 5,  they 
scored higher than control participants on reduced 
behavioural activation (d=0·59), reduced experience of 
pleasure (d=0·46), and fatigue (d=0·43; p<0·0001 for all 
three). Subtype 5 can be termed slightly distressed, low 
reactive insomnia disorder. The characteristics that 
discriminate the similarly distressed subtypes 4 and 5 
most are duration (d=1·68) and severity (d=1·04) of 
insomnia response to life events, and childhood trauma 
(d=1·11; p<0·0001 for all three), which are less frequent in 
participants with subtype 5. Further details of these 
classifications are shown in the appendix (p 36).
Figure 3: Multivariate profile plots of the subtypes of insomnia
Data are scaled subtype group means (95% CIs), in which Z scores have been 
standardised to the mean and standard deviation of controls for each 
characteristic, with the subtype-explained variance, ranked clockwise from the 
top. (A) Highly distressed subtype (subtype 1). (B) Moderately distressed 
subtypes (subtype 2, which was reward sensitive, and subtype 3, which was 
reward insensitive). (C) Low distress subtypes (subtype 4, which was high 
reactive, and subtype 5, which was low reactive). Positive characteristics 
(eg, positive rumination) were reverse-coded and renamed (eg, reduced positive 
rumination), such that higher values uniformly indicate higher general distress 
for all characteristics throughout the plot. Coloured boxes indicate the three 
characteristics that differentiate each subtype most from control participants.

Lasso regularisation selected the 19 most discriminating 
characteristics for the ITQ (appendix pp 4, 14). The 
selection correctly classified 904 (86%) of 1046 original 
participants, with high posterior probabilities (0·90–0·97). 
Use of the ITQ to classify 251 new participants also 
resulted in high posterior probabilities (0·92–1·00) and 
low misclassification (10%). The robustness of a specific 
five­class solution was verified in this non­overlapping 
cohort. Again, as compared with latent class analysis 
models with more or fewer subtypes, a five­class 
solution was optimal, as indicated by the lowest 
Bayesian information criterion (figure 2) and excellent 
posterior probabilities (0·99–1·00) and misclassification 
(4·5%).
215 (21%) of 1046 participants who were reassessed 4·8 
(SD 1·6) years later maintained their subtype at a 
probability of 0·87, indicating a high stability of these 
subtypes (table 2). Participants who were originally 
classified as highly or moderately distressed subtypes 
had high probabilities (0·86–0·89) of maintaining their 
subtype after an average of 4·8 years. The consistency 
of subtypes between baseline and follow­up was 
more modest for those who were first classified in 
subtypes 4 (0·67) or 5 (0·44). However, participants who 
were originally classified in subtype 4 or 5 and switched 
subtype almost exclusively switched to the other slightly 
distressed subtype: those classified as subtype 4 had a 
probability of 0·94 that they would maintain a slightly 
distressed subtype (4 or 5) and those classified as 
subtype 5 had a probability of 0·81 that they would 
maintain a slightly distressed subtype (4 or 5). 
Although the current severity of the three key insomnia 
complaints of difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty 
maintaining sleep, and early morning awakening did not 
differ between subtypes (table 1), their developmental 
onset differed markedly. Most notably, half of the 
participants classified in subtypes 1 and 2 reported 
difficulty initiating sleep by their teenage years but, in 
participants classified in subtypes 4 and 5, half of the 
participants reported difficulty initiating sleep only by age 
40 years (figure 4; appendix p 8). Subtypes 1 and 2 thus 
both represent more participants with insomnia disorder 
that might conventionally be labelled idiopathic insomnia.
The proportion of participants with comorbid sleep 
disorders (table 1) did not differ across subtypes, except 
for recurrent nightmares and confusional arousals, 
which were both highest in subtype 1 and lowest in 
subtype 5. The proportions of participants classified 
within each subtype who reported diseases in the main 
ICD­10 categories, including mental and behavioural 
disorders. are also shown in table 1. Two main categories 
were differentially represented between subtypes: 
diseases of the nervous system were most frequent in 
participants classified in subtype 5 and least frequent in 
participants classified in subtype 2, and symptoms not 
elsewhere classified were most frequent in participants 
classified in subtype 1 and least frequent in participants 
classified in subtype 5. Four mental and behavioural 
disorder subcategories (mood, anxiety, personality, and 
childhood onset) were differentially represented across 
subtypes, mostly driven by a high prevalence of these 
disorders in participants classified in subtype 1.
The prevalence of current and lifetime depression 
differed markedly across subtypes (both χ²(4)>110; both 
p<0·0001;  table 1) and were most frequent in participants 
classified in subtype 1, who also reported the greatest 
frequency of recurrent nightmares, in accordance with 
previously reported associations of insomnia, nightmares 
and depression.24 Notably, current depression was three 
times less prevalent in participants classified in subtype 2 
(16 [6%] of 267 participants) than in participants classified 
in subtype 3 (25 [19%] of 134 participants), despite their 
similar indications of general distress (figure 3). There 
was up to a five times difference between subtypes in the 
lifetime risk of depression (table 1).
Incidental benzodiazepine intake affected difficulty 
initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early 
morning awakening, and fatigue differently across the 
five subtypes (F(16,406)=1·75; p=0·04). The most notable 
differences with benzodiazepine intake were reported 
in difficulty maintaining sleep, which improved most in 
participants classified in subtypes 2 and 4 but not in 
subtype 3 (figure 4; appendix p 9).
CBT for insomnia affected the ISI scores of patients 
differently between subtypes 2 and 4 (appendix pp 9, 10). 
Compared with control group patients who were awaiting 
CBT, this treatment ameliorated difficulty initiating sleep 
significantly more in subtype 2 (mean change in score 
–0·8 [SD 1·9]; p=0·0003) than in subtype 4, where it was 
ineffective (0·1, [SD 1·5]; p=0·69). This disparity in 
response to CBT was also reflected in the total ISI score 
(–5·5, SD 7·8; p<0·0001; vs –3·1, SD 7·3; p=0·003 in 
type 4). Notably, the under 
representation of subtypes 1, 3, 
and 5 in this sample illustrates how commonly differing 
selection criteria can strongly affect the subtype 
distribution of the study. We found that strict criteria on 
mood symptoms impeded inclusion of participants in 
subtypes 1 and 3 from participation in this study, whereas 
a low prevalence and age exclusion criteria impeded 
inclusion of participants of subtype 5.
Compared with control group participants without 
sleep complaints, the ERP to standard tones exclusively 
showed a stronger positive deflection during a wide late

period  of information processing up to at least 1000 ms 
after the tone was played in participants classified in 
subtype 4, and this finding was significantly different 
from controls at 273–348 ms (p=0·038), 361–493 ms 
(p=0·014), and 724–1000 ms (p=0·004; figure 4). ERPs 
of subtype 2, by contrast, were indistinguishable from 
those of control group participants. These findings 
indicate hyperreactive late processing specifically in 
subtype 4, who appeared to experience even standard 
tones as more salient (as indicated by the P300 potential 
amplitude) and emotionally relevant (as indicated by 
the late positive potential amplitude), in agreement 
with their questionnaire­based label of being highly 
reactive.23
Discussion
In our study, we identified five insomnia disorder 
subtypes that were differentiated by biologically based 
traits and life history. The subtypes that we identified 
were a highly distressed type that was characterised by 
distress across all domains; two moderately distressed 
types, one of which was reward sensitive and the other of 
which was reward insensitive; and two slightly distressed 
subtypes, one of which showed high reactivity to life 
events and the other of which showed low reactivity. 
Subtyping was stable over time, clinically relevant,  and 
biologically meaningful, as indicated by enhanced 
salience and emotion signalling in the brain of 
participants classified as type 4. Subtyping is feasible

with a concise set of questions that we have made 
available (appendix p 37), including automated scoring.
The subtypes were not primarily distinguished by 
existing clinical demarcations such as difficulty initiating 
sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, or early morning 
awakening, nor by comorbid sleep disorders. Rather, 
subtypes emerged as specific, multivariate profiles of 
stable characteristics that were not directly related to 
sleep but were relevant to insomnia.19 High or low scores 
on single variables were not unique to our insomnia 
subtypes, but the fingerprints of specific combinations 
of score levels on these characteristics are unique to the 
subtypes. Ancillary analyses (appendix p 10) showed that 
none of the five subtypes resembled subtypes that can be 
found with bottom­up subtyping of people without 
insomnia.
The stability of subtypes over several years that we 
found was notable. Most participants were identically 
classified 4·8 (SD 1·6) years after their initial subtyping 
(at a probability of 0·87), which compares favourably to 
previous clinical subtyping that showed poor reliability15 
and instability over even a brief period (33% over 
4 months).14 To our knowledge, our insomnia disorder 
subtypes are the first to fulfil the primary requirement of 
stability that is necessary to find differential trajectories 
for, biomarkers of, and treatment responses in insomnia 
disorder.
Clinically, our identified subtypes provide precision 
targets to improve cognitive, emotional, and behavioural 
interventions. For example, because a meditation 
intervention lowers pre­sleep arousal,25 this treatment 
could particularly be recommended for people with 
insomnia disorder of subtypes 1, 2, and 3, which are 
characterised by high pre­sleep arousal. Interventions that 
aim to improve positive affect and happiness26 could be 
evaluated for people with insomnia subtypes 3 and 5, who 
showed a disproportional reduced positive affect or 
experience of pleasure. Finally, sleep problems related to 
childhood adversity, which was most prevalent among 
participants with subtypes 1 and 4, could require trauma 
therapy rather than CBT for insomnia only.27
The clinical relevance of subtyping reaches beyond 
insomnia. Possibly related to a strong genetic overlap,5 
insomnia is a primary risk factor for depression.8 The 
Global Consortium for Depression Prevention stated 
that the best chance to combat the global burden of 
depression is to identify people who run the highest risk 
and to provide them with preventive interventions.28 
Supported by the strong differences in current comorbid 
and lifetime depression, our subtyping approach could 
enable us to identify people with insomnia disorder who 
are most at risk for developing depression, and to 
prioritise their inclusion in preventive trials. Participants 
with subtype 1 insomnia scored highly on several 
symptoms of depression and showed the highest risk of 
lifetime depression. However, near half of participants 
classified in subtype 1 had never experienced depression. 
This finding is of considerable clinical interest for at least 
two reasons. First, people with subtype 1 insomnia 
disorder might have subclinical depression, and people 
with this subtype are most suitable to select for 
intervention programmes that aim to prevent depression. 
Use of our ITQ could facilitate such selection. Second, 
there could be an unknown factor that makes the 
unaffected half of our participants with subtype 1 resilient 
to depression despite a high risk.
We illustrated how differentiation between subtypes 2 
and 4 could propel the identification of biomarkers that 
would otherwise remain hidden by heterogeneity. ERPs 
deviated from the values in controls in participants with 
subtype 4 insomnia but not subtype 2 insomnia. The high 
amplitude late positive potential of the ERP in subtype 4 
could relate to polymorphisms in the β1­receptor gene 
and response to beta­blockers, thus providing an example 
of a drug­targetable biomarker.23 More specifically C/C 
homozygotes for the G1165C polymorphism in the 
β1­adrenergic receptor showed a larger late positive 
potential amplitude than G/C heterozygotes and G/G 
homozygotes. Moreover, our ERP finding supports 
consistency of labelling subtype 4 as reactive across 
psychometric traits and neurophysiology, thus meeting 
an important goal of the Research Domain Criteria.29
Finally, we constructed and validated our ITQ, 
including automated analysis, to facilitate subtyping in 
future studies on insomnia. This subtyping can be done 
online and will accelerate insight into underlying causes 
and biomarkers of insomnia disorder and the develop­
ment of better, more personalised treatments.
Some limitations should be mentioned. First, 
although five subtypes were found to be optimal in both 
the original sample and the second, non­overlapping 
validation cohort, we cannot exclude the existence of 
other subtypes—for example, among people who do not 
volunteer for online assessment—because the NSR did 
not sample randomly from the general population. We 
deliberately did not exclusively sample from sleep 
clinics because, unfortunately, insomnia often goes un­
noticed in general practice.16 Sleep centre­based studies 
overrepresent complex insomnia in people who are 
more affected, but the NSR reaches a more diverse 
population of people with insomnia disorder. A possible 
disadvantage of case­control comparisons from the NSR 
could be that the control group might have been biased 
to include more people with a special interest in sleep or 
helping science. Therefore, replication of our study in a 
strict population­based sample will be useful.
Second, we defined probable insomnia disorder by an 
ISI cutoff score of 10. Although this cutoff has been 
validated several times5,21 and the ISI has been validated 
for web­based assessment,30 it could be asked whether the 
cutoff can indicate insomnia of sufficient severity to 
warrant independent clinical attention and thus a separate 
DSM­5 diagnosis. A randomised trial31 in patients with 
major depressive disorder used the same ISI cutoff of 10

to define comorbid insomnia; this study found that 
clinical attention to insomnia of this severity was highly 
valuable because treatment reduced insomnia and 
depression. This finding adds to the clinical validity of the 
ISI cutoff. The traditional approach to treat only the other 
morbidity, with the expectation that insomnia will resolve, 
is not regarded as the most appropriate approach;17 
treatment of both conditions simultaneously might 
improve the outcomes for both conditions.32 In support of 
this hypothesis, a meta­analysis33 that included 17 studies 
that used ISI scores supported treatment of insomnia in 
conjunction with comorbid psychiatric and medical 
conditions.
Finally, traits that we have not assessed could 
discriminate yet other subtypes. Although we cannot ex­
clude this possibility, it should be noted that we included 
an unprecedentedly large number of stable characteristics. 
Moreover, subtypes were defined by several characteristics, 
suggesting at least some robustness for unobserved 
characteristics. Within these limitations, the identification 
of subtypes enables important possibilities for pursuing 
subtype­specific 
risks, 
biomarkers, 
or 
treatment 
responses.
In summary, we found that insomnia disorder can be 
classified into robust subtypes that can be discriminated by 
multivariate profiles of traits of affect and personality and 
life history. Subtyping was highly consistent after 4·8 years 
of follow up, results could be replicated in a  second, non­
overlapping cohort, and the subtypes could reliably be 
assessed with the ITQ. Insomnia subtyping paves the way 
for studies that aim to prevent depression, resolve in­
consistencies in and reduce heterogeneity of insomnia, 
and reveal differential causes of and develop better tailored 
personalised treatment for insomnia disorder.
