Abstract
Background: Patients who require positive pressure ventilation through a tracheostomy are unable to phonate
due to the inflated tracheostomy cuff. Whilst a speaking valve (SV) can be used on a tracheostomy tube, its
use in ventilated ICU patients has been inhibited by concerns regarding potential deleterious effects to
recovering lungs. The objective of this study was to assess end expiratory lung impedance (EELI) and standard
bedside respiratory parameters before, during and after SV use in tracheostomised patients weaning from
mechanical ventilation.
Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted in a cardio-thoracic adult ICU. 20 consecutive
tracheostomised patients weaning from mechanical ventilation and using a SV were recruited. Electrical
Impedance Tomography (EIT) was used to monitor patients’ EELI. Changes in lung impedance and standard
bedside respiratory data were analysed pre, during and post SV use.
Results: Use of in-line SVs resulted in significant increase of EELI. This effect grew and was maintained for at
least 15 minutes after removal of the SV (p < 0.001). EtCO2 showed a significant drop during SV use (p = 0.01)
whilst SpO2 remained unchanged. Respiratory rate (RR (breaths per minute)) decreased whilst the SV was
in situ (p <0.001), and heart rate (HR (beats per minute)) was unchanged. All results were similar regardless of
the patients’ respiratory requirements at time of recruitment.
Conclusions: In this cohort of critically ill ventilated patients, SVs did not cause derecruitment of the lungs
when used in the ventilator weaning period. Deflating the tracheostomy cuff and restoring the airflow via the
upper airway with a one-way valve may facilitate lung recruitment during and after SV use, as indicated by
increased EELI.

 Background
Invasively ventilated patients are unable to phonate due
to either the endotracheal tube positioning through the
vocal folds, or when ventilating through the tracheos-
tomy, the air bypassing the vocal folds. Speaking valves
(SVs) can be used in-line with mechanical ventilation,
but use of these requires deflation of the tracheostomy
cuff [1]. Cuff deflation causes a leak in the ventilator cir-
cuit, which has been considered detrimental to patients’
ventilation, and potentially deleterious to weaning.
The key concern raised by physicians is that by deflat-
ing the cuff, and thus, losing positive end-expiratory
pressure (PEEP) this could lead to loss of lung volume
through alveolar collapse. It has been demonstrated that
loss of PEEP in other events such as suctioning [2, 3]
and ventilator disconnection [4] causes loss of lung vol-
ume. Current data indicate that “open lung ventilatory
strategies” minimise ventilator-induced lung injury [5].
Hence, practices that may cause loss of lung volume
must be used with some degree of caution.
One small case series has described the apparently safe
use of SVs during weaning from mechanical ventilation
[6]. Another study found no significant difference in
ventilator weaning and decannulation times post the
introduction of in-line SVs into an adult intensive care
unit (ICU) [7, 8]. Whilst these studies provide prelimin-
ary clinical support for use of in-line SVs with tracheos-
tomised mechanically ventilated patients, there are no
physiological data to prove or allay fears.
Currently there are no data on the effect of SVs on
end-expiratory lung volume (EELV), a critical point
when the lungs are at most risk of collapsing. An SV is a
one-way valve that allows for inspiration via the trache-
ostomy tube whilst expiration is redirected to the upper
airway via the vocal folds, enabling phonation [1] and re-
stored upper airway resistance. Hence, it can be consid-
ered functionally as a PEEP valve on the tracheostomy.
As there is no airflow back into the ventilator tubing
with the one-way valve, current in situ monitoring of
ventilation with standard bedside equipment provides
the clinician with limited information on ventilation.
While computerised tomography or magnetic resonance
imaging may be able to provide this information, the re-
peated use these imaging procedures could be seen as
ethically unjustifiable, expensive, possibly requiring a
level of sedation, and putting patients at risk with the
transfer outside of the ICU environment [9, 10].
Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a radiation-
free real-time bedside imaging tool capable of measuring
the air movement in and out of the thorax [11–14]. It
has been observed as being a safe, reliable and reprodu-
cible technique to assess regional ventilation in the lung,
specifically during recruitment manoeuvres [3]. In the
future it may be possible for absolute EIT to directly
measure EELV but current time-differencing systems rely
on measuring the difference between end-inspiratory lung
impedance and EELI to measure tidal variation of imped-
ance and changes in EELI [12]. There is linear correlation
between changes in the EELI and changes in EELV [15–17],
although this relationship tends to overestimate changes
in EELV [16]. A limitation of time-differencing EIT is that
it is unable to detect the pre-existing EELI [18, 19], which
means it can only detect changes in EELI if the device re-
mains in situ and running between readings [15, 18–20].
Researchers, however, have successfully used EIT to de-
tect changes in EELI due to various clinical interven-
tions such as suctioning, position change, and changes
in PEEP [13, 16, 20–23].
The aim of this study was to assess the effect of SVs
on EELI. Based on the findings of prior case studies it
was hypothesised that there is an increase in global EELI
with the SV in situ when patients are performing trials
off the ventilator (i.e., on 50 L of 40 % oxygen via the
tracheostomy). This may potentially be similar when pa-
tients are constantly supported by mechanical ventila-
tion, given restored physiological PEEP. Secondary aims
included determining the effects of SV on the patient’s
respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation
(SpO2) and end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2). The po-
tential effect on respiratory mechanics of talking versus
quietly breathing with the SV in situ, and the effects of
the SV and its dependence on the patients’ ventilatory
requirements at the time, were also investigated.
Methods
Following human ethics approval by the Institutional
Review Board (HREC/13/QPCH/95) a prospective obser-
vational study (ACTRN12615000589583) using a repeated
measures design was conducted. The study took place in a
primarily cardiothoracic ICU at a metropolitan tertiary
teaching hospital. Consecutive patients who were tra-
cheostomised and being weaned from mechanical ventila-
tion, from November 2013 to December 2014, were
considered for inclusion in the study if they were tolerat-
ing a SV for a minimum of 30 minutes, as jointly assessed
by a speech pathologist and a physician. Patients were ex-
cluded if they had significant language or cognitive defi-
cits, or were not suitable to wear an EIT belt (i.e., patients
with ventricular assist devices, open chest, extensive
sternal dressings/drains or those dependant on cardiac
pacing). In total 20 patients were recruited into two
groups: 1) 10 patients on pressure support ventilation
(PSV) and 2) 10 patients having trial periods off mechan-
ical ventilation (and transferred onto high-flow or low-
flow oxygen via the tracheostomy). All patients provided
written informed consent, or for those unable to sign for
written consent, the consent was provided by a legally
authorised person (e.g., family member) or by the patient’s

 nurse witnessing verbal consent. The study was conducted
in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the
1964 Declaration of Helsinki.
Measures
Following informed consent, patients were enrolled in
the study. EIT (Pulmovista, Draeger Medical, Lubeck,
Germany) measurements were taken continuously for
60 minutes with the frame rate set to 10 Hz to give the
EELI per breath. Transitions to and from SV were followed
by 15-minute periods, to allow for stabilisation [24].
Set ventilator-delivered PEEP and fraction of inspired
oxygen (FiO2) data were collected from the ventilator
(Puritan Bennett 840, Covidien, Dublin, Ireland). HR
and SpO2 were measured with pulse oximeter (504, Cri-
ticare systems, Waukesha, WI, USA). Airway pressure
(Paw) was measured directly via a neonatal feeding cath-
eter (6 F) introduced through the Luer port of an
adaptor (Ikaria, Hampton, NJ, USA) advanced to lie just
distal to the tracheostomy cannula in the trachea, and
measured with a pressure transducer (PPT, Honeywell,
Morris Plains, NJ, USA). Oximeter and pressure data
were collected at 200 Hz (PowerLab, AD Instruments,
Sydney, NSW, Australia). EtCO2 was sampled from the
feeding tube and measured (Marquette Solar 8000, GE
Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). EtCO2 was measured
continuously throughout the 60 minutes apart from 2
minutes before, during and after SV use when continu-
ous Paw measurements were taken through the same
catheter. There was no flow through the catheter during
pressure measurements, to ensure highest possible fidel-
ity. All data were collected on a breath-to-breath basis
using custom-written software.
Procedure
The patients were positioned either in bed at 45 degrees
or in a straight-backed chair with the EIT electrode belt
around their chest at the level of the fifth to sixth anter-
ior intercostal space. As patient position has been shown
to have an impact on ventilation distribution [13], we
ensured that there were no significant changes in patient
positioning throughout the data collection. A neonatal
feeding catheter was inserted as described above and the
pulse oximeter was positioned on the finger.
Fifteen minutes of data were recorded continuously
during four discrete periods: (1) baseline – prior to
placement of the SV in-line with mechanical ventilation;
(2) quiet breathing with SV in-line; (3) talking with SV
in-line; and (4) post removal of the in-line SV. After the
baseline period the tracheostomy cuff was deflated with
simultaneous tracheal suctioning to clear secretions
pooling above the cuff and minimise aspiration. The SV
(PMV007, Passy Muir Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) was then
inserted in-line with the ventilation circuit following the
adapter that accommodated the EtCO2/Paw catheter. Ven-
tilator settings were changed while the SV was in situ in
the patients supported by pressure support ventilation
(PSV). This included switching the system to non-invasive
(NIV) mode for PSV (to more easily control expiratory
alarms) and reducing the set ventilator-delivered PEEP by
5 cmH2O [25]. This change in settings was based, in the
absence of any scientific data to define optimal settings,
on recommendations by the SV manufacturer. During the
second data collection period patients were instructed to
continue to breathe normally and avoid talking. Once the
third data collection period commenced the patients were
instructed to converse as they wished with the researcher,
family member, or healthcare team. When verbal commu-
nication was limited, the researcher used picture cards
and open-ended questions to facilitate verbal output. As
there is a suggested difference in breathing patterns be-
tween different speech tasks (planned vs non-planned)
[26], no set tasks were given to participants, and spontan-
eous speech was encouraged. At the completion of period
3, the ventilator settings were returned to baseline, the SV
was removed, and the tracheostomy cuff re-inflated. Data
collection continued in the fourth period as per baseline
conditions. Routine tracheal suctioning was performed
during data collection as per individual patient needs.
Data analysis
Data were analysed offline post data collection using
commercially available Draeger software (Draeger EIT
Data Analysis Tool 6.1). EELI was averaged across the
readings and displayed as mean EELI for each of the
four data collection periods. A mixed effects regression
model was used to investigate the changes in EELI com-
pared to baseline. Planned comparisons between base-
line and each subsequent data collection period were
conducted using the paired t test, for RR, EtCO2, HR
and SpO2. The level of significance was set at p <0.05
throughout, with 95 % confidence intervals quoted where
appropriate. All statistical analyses were conducted using
STATATM (version 12.0).
Results
During the study period 55 tracheostomised patients
used an SV, and all were assessed for inclusion in the
study. Of these patients 20 met the inclusion criteria and
were enrolled in the study. Figure 1 details the reasons
for exclusion or non-participation in the study.
The mean age of the patients in the study was 60.4 ±
14.9 years (50 % male). The mean age for all tracheosto-
mised patients in the ICU throughout the recruitment
period was 57.1 ± 17.4 years (64.6 % male). On average,
patients used an SV for 2.5 days prior to recruitment to
the study. There were 10 patients assessed whilst being
ventilated with PSV, and 10 assessed during periods off

 the ventilator (9 on high-flow, one on low-flow oxygen)
for the duration of data collection. All but one of the pa-
tients who were assessed off ventilator were still requir-
ing >12 h/day of mechanical ventilation. See Table 1 for
the specifics of respiratory requirements. The majority
of patients (17) had their tracheostomy tubes inserted
percutaneously in the ICU. Primary reasons for ICU ad-
mission included cardiac surgery (n = 13, 65 %) or re-
spiratory disease (n = 5). Nineteen of the patients (95 %)
had received a tracheostomy due to prolonged need for
mechanical ventilation. Patient number 3 had the trache-
ostomy initially inserted for surgery in the upper airway,
but required prolonged respiratory support following
cardiac surgery. See Table 2 for a more detailed descrip-
tion of all patients in the study.
A statistically significant increase in EELI was ob-
served between baseline and all subsequent data collec-
tion periods. A mean increase by 19.7 % (213 units)
occurred from baseline to period 2 (SV + quiet breath-
ing, p = 0.034). Further increase from baseline by 83.6 %
(905 units) (p <0.001) and 120 % (1,299 units) (p <0.001)
were seen in data collection period 3 and 4, respectively
(see Fig. 2 and Table 3).
Of note, patients’ ventilatory requirements at the time
of recruitment did not have a significant impact on
change in EELI, any of the respiratory parameters or
HR. The patients who were supported on PSV during
data collection had an initial non-significant drop in
EELI. However, a similar increase in EELI with patients
off the ventilator was noted for the third and fourth
period of data collection (see Fig. 2).
EtCO2 decreased significantly during SV use (p = 0.02
for period 2 and p = 0.01 for period 3) and returned to
baseline for period 4. RR decreased significantly from
baseline while SV was used in-line with the ventilation
circuit (p = 0.001, p <0.001 for periods 2 and 3, respect-
ively), and returned to baseline once the SV was removed.
HR and SpO2 did not change significantly throughout
data collection.
Only limited data on Paw were captured (three partici-
pants with full data, seven with partial data). These data
all indicated similar drops in Paw coinciding with the

 reduction of ventilator-delivered PEEP for the duration
of the SV use. Ventilator data showed that there was
minimal expired tidal volume when the SV was in-line
(see Table 4).
Discussion
The findings indicated that use of SVs in this cohort did
not result in any significant de-recruitment of the lungs,
which was contrary to concerns initially voiced by physi-
cians. Standard bedside respiratory data demonstrated
reduced work of breathing with adequate gas exchange.
The increase in EELI may indicate increased EELV. Fur-
ther analysis is necessary to more fully determine venti-
lation distribution, as an increase in EELV could be due
to further recruitment or over-inflation of already aer-
ated parts of the lung.
The increase in EELI with the SV in the ventilator cir-
cuit is likely to occur through the restoration of the pa-
tient’s ability to breathe through the larynx and upper
airway, as opposed to the continuously patent tracheos-
tomy tube. Upper airway resistance is increased due to
the resistance created by exhalation against and around
the effectively closed tracheostomy tube (through the
actions of the SV) and its deflated cuff, ensuring more
residual air in the lungs at the end of expiration. Further
analysis is required to confirm that lung hyperinflation
did not occur as it could be argued that an increase in
EELI may correlate to tidal hyperinflation. We used
SpO2 and EtCO2 as simple measures to exclude patho-
logical degrees of hyperinflation, but this cannot exclude
it fully. Of note, all patients had been using an SV before
the study with no gross signs of hyperinflation on rou-
tine chest radiographs.
The subsequent increase in EELI when patients talked
is explicable through the additional, but variable, upper
airway resistance caused by the glottis [27] with vocal
folds closing and opening during attempts at phonation.
The SV appeared to act as a recruitment manoeuvre. An
increase in EELI was observed during SV use and its ef-
fect remained after removal of the SV from the patient’s
ventilation circuit. EELI remained stable for 8–9 minutes
once the SV was removed from the ventilator circuit
and the tracheostomy cuff re-inflated before a further in-
crease occurred.
There are several potential explanations for the drop
in EtCO2 during the SV use. One reason may be a drop
in EtCO2 due to using one’s voice, as observed in a study
of healthy subjects [28]. Another potential reason is
dead-space washout in the upper airway that has been
found in other studies [29, 30] to coincide with an in-
crease in tidal volumes. With our current data, we can-
not categorically state, however, that tidal volumes
increased for patients in this study. A third potential
aetiological cause may be that the exhaled air just past the
tracheostomy cannula from where EtCO2 was measured
was being diluted with fresh inspiratory flow in all patients
on high-flow oxygen, and some on PSV while the cuff was
deflated. Transcutaneous carbon dioxide (TcCO2) and
arterial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) may need to
be measured in similar studies in the future.
Only limited data on Paw were captured, due to rapid
and repeated obstruction of the fine-bore catheter with
secretions due to presence of no flow through the cath-
eter during the numerous 2-minute measurements. A
similar reduction in Paw coinciding with the turning
down of the set ventilator-delivered PEEP for the dur-
ation of the SV use was noted. However, due to lack of
data, it is difficult to draw any conclusions. Further stud-
ies are needed to further look at Paw and ventilator-
delivered PEEP with and without an SV in circuit.
It was surprising to observe that the ventilator demon-
strated substantial exhaled tidal volume whilst the SV
was in situ. This may indicate the presence of a leak in
the SV or some form of back-pressure. This means that
the ventilator may actually still be delivering PEEP when
a one-way valve is in place, and will be the subject of
further studies.

 Communication is a key issue for ventilated patients,
who find the inability to speak distressing [31–33]. Diffi-
culties with communication in the tracheostomised
patient population have been associated with social with-
drawal, leading to depression, lack of motivation to
participate in care [31, 34–36], poor sleep, and increased
anxiety and stress levels [37], which has both short-term
and long-term impacts on patient outcomes in ICU and
post ICU stay. By demonstrating the potential physio-
logical benefits on top of the already known and more
obvious psychological benefits, SVs present an excellent
way to improve patient care in the ICU.
Increased use of SV brings with it multiple questions,
such as, for how long should the SVs be used at any one
time? Does this lead to fatigue? Should the SVs be used
with patients during mobilisation? Future studies are
needed to look at the efficacy of SVs in the weaning and

Limitations of the study
This study was conducted on a specific cohort of ICU
patients, mostly cardiothoracic, and extrapolation of
these data to patients with different pathological condi-
tions may not be wise. This is even more relevant in pa-
tients with spinal and brain injuries in whom central
control of breathing might be affected.
No
patients
in
this
study
were
ventilated
using
volume-controlled modes, hence there is a need to de-
termine whether restored physiological PEEP through
the SV helps compensate for the leak in the ventilatory
circuit similarly in volume-controlled ventilation.
Airway pressures were only measured for the second
half of the study with limited data obtained as described
above. Hence the reported Paw data may be a poor rep-
resentation of the actual Paw across the time points in
the study, and was therefore not reported in detail. Dif-
ferent methods to obtain these important data are rec-
ommended for future similar studies. Minor difficulties
also occurred with EtCO2 measurements (measured in
all patients in the study) through the same catheter.
However, due to the presence of airflow in the catheter
during EtCO2 measurement, this reduced the likelihood
of the catheter becoming blocked with secretions, and
resulted in almost full data collection across 60 minutes
obtained from all patients.
Routine suctioning was performed as per patient needs
throughout data collection. It is known that tracheal
suctioning causes a degree of de-recruitment [22]. The
quantitative effect of suctioning was not specifically ana-
lysed as part of this study, nor were these periods ex-
cised from data analysis. De-recruitment caused by
tracheal suctioning could therefore be a confounding
factor and negatively skew our data on the effect of SVs.
The duration of the study was only a total of one hour
with the SV in situ for 30 minutes. Clinically the same
patients would be using the SV for several hours at a
time. Due to the inability to compare the change in EELI
between sessions and the patients needing to remain in
the same position, the EIT belt stayed in situ for the
duration of the study with the patients sitting up. There-
fore it was not feasible to monitor the patients for
longer.
Conclusions
When SVs were used in this cohort of cardio-respiratory
patients, we observed no evidence of lung de-recruitment
whilst weaning from mechanical ventilation. Deflation of
the tracheostomy cuff with restoration of the airflow via
the upper airway with a one-way valve facilitated an in-
crease in EELI both during and after a period of SV use in
our cohort of patients, which may indicate recruitment of
the lungs. Use of the SV resulted in reduced RR and a re-
duced end-tidal CO2.
Key messages
� Speaking valve use facilitated an increase in end-
expiratory lung impedance in tracheostomised
cardiothoracic ICU patients weaning off mechanical
ventilation
� Increased end-expiratory lung impedance was
maintained and further increased for at least
15 minutes post removal of the speaking valve from
the ventilation circuit
� Speaking valve use resulted in a reduced respiratory
rate and reduced end-tidal CO2 when used in
tracheostomised cardiothoracic ICU patients
weaning off mechanical ventilation

 Authors’ information
AS is a senior Speech Pathologist in the ICU where the study took place.
Commencing employment in yet another ICU where tracheostomised
ventilated patients did not have a voice, the issue of no available scientific
evidence to support or negate the use of speaking valves was raised. JFF is
an intensivist in the same ICU, and also runs the Critical Care Research Group
that assisted in the trialing of the Electrical Impedance Tomography
prototype in the facility. AS and JFF decided to see what was actually
happening to lung recruitment when the cuff was deflated and speaking
valve put in-line with the patient’s ventilation circuit. Case studies
demonstrated supportive data, which then lead to designing of this study
and AS commencing a PhD project.
