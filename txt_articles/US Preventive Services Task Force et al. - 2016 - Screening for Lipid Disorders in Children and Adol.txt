Summary of Recommendation and Evidence
The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to
assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for
lipid disorders in children and adolescents 20 years or younger
(I statement) (Figure 1).
Rationale
Importance
Dyslipidemia,ageneticormultifactorialdisorderoflipoproteinme-
tabolism, is defined by elevations in levels of total cholesterol (TC),
low-densitylipoproteincholesterol(LDL-C),non–high-densitylipo-
protein cholesterol (non–HDL-C), triglycerides, or some combina-
tion thereof, as well as lower levels of HDL cholesterol (HDL-C).
ElevationsinlevelsofTC,LDL-C,andnon–HDL-Careassociatedwith
risk of cardiovascular disease in adults, as are lower levels of HDL-C

IMPORTANCE Elevations in levels of total, low-density lipoprotein, and non–high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol; lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; and, to a lesser
extent, elevated triglyceride levels are associated with risk of cardiovascular disease in adults.
OBJECTIVE To update the 2007 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)
recommendation on screening for lipid disorders in children, adolescents, and young adults.
EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for lipid disorders in
children and adolescents 20 years or younger—1 review focused on screening for
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, and 1 review focused on screening for
multifactorial dyslipidemia.
FINDINGS Evidence on the quantitative difference in diagnostic yield between universal and
selective screening approaches, the effectiveness and harms of long-term treatment and the
harms of screening, and the association between changes in intermediate outcomes and
improvements in adult cardiovascular health outcomes are limited. Therefore, the USPSTF
concludes that the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is
insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for lipid disorders in
children and adolescents 20 years or younger. (I statement)

Suggestions for Practice
B
The USPSTF recommends the service. There is high certainty that the net benefit is moderate, or
there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial.
Offer or provide this service.
C
The USPSTF recommends selectively offering or providing this service to individual patients
based on professional judgment and patient preferences. There is at least moderate certainty
that the net benefit is small.
Offer or provide this service for selected
patients depending on individual
circumstances.
D
The USPSTF recommends against the service. There is moderate or high certainty that the service
has no net benefit or that the harms outweigh the benefits.
Discourage the use of this service.
I statement
The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits
and harms of the service. Evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, and the balance of
benefits and harms cannot be determined.
Read the Clinical Considerations section
of the USPSTF Recommendation
Statement. If the service is offered,
patients should understand the
uncertainty about the balance of benefits
and harms.
USPSTF Levels of Certainty Regarding Net Benefit
Level of Certainty
Description
High
The available evidence usually includes consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative primary care
populations. These studies assess the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes. This conclusion is therefore unlikely to be
strongly affected by the results of future studies.
Moderate
The available evidence is sufficient to determine the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes, but confidence in the estimate
is constrained by such factors as 
the number, size, or quality of individual studies.
inconsistency of findings across individual studies.
limited generalizability of findings to routine primary care practice.
lack of coherence in the chain of evidence.
As more information becomes available, the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change, and this change may be large
enough to alter the conclusion.
The USPSTF defines certainty as “likelihood that the USPSTF assessment of the net benefit of a preventive service is correct.” The net benefit is defined as
benefit minus harm of the preventive service as implemented in a general, primary care population. The USPSTF assigns a certainty level based on the nature
of the overall evidence available to assess the net benefit of a preventive service.
Low
The available evidence is insufficient to assess effects on health outcomes. Evidence is insufficient because of
the limited number or size of studies.
important flaws in study design or methods.
inconsistency of findings across individual studies.
gaps in the chain of evidence.
findings not generalizable to routine primary care practice.
lack of information on important health outcomes.
More information may allow estimation of effects on health outcomes.

ported a reduction in carotid intima-media thickness. The USPSTF
found inadequate evidence to address whether treatment with
short-term pharmacotherapy leads directly to a reduced incidence
of premature cardiovascular disease (eg, myocardial infarction or

Harms of Early Detection and Treatment
The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to assess the harms of
screening for familial hypercholesterolemia or multifactorial dyslip-
idemia. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to assess the long-
term harms of treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia in chil-
dren or adolescents. Long-term evidence on the treatment of
familial hypercholesterolemia was limited to 1 study of statins.
Short-term statin use was generally well tolerated in children and
adolescents with familial hypercholesterolemia, with transient
adverse effects (such as elevated liver enzyme levels). Treatment
with bile acid–sequestering agents was commonly associated with
gastrointestinal symptoms and poor palatability. The USPSTF also
found inadequate evidence to assess the harms of treatment of
multifactorial dyslipidemia in children or adolescents. One trial of a
low-fat, low-cholesterol dietary intervention in children with multi-
factorial dyslipidemia showed no harms.

For a summary of the evidence systematically reviewed in making this recommendation, the full recommendation statement, and supporting documents, please
go to (http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org).
Multifactorial dyslipidemia is associated with risk factors such as environmental factors (eg, obesity) and currently unidentified
genetic factors. Familial hypercholesterolemia is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a genetic mutation.
Total cholesterol may be measured with fasting or nonfasting serum testing. Serum LDL-C levels may be calculated using
the Friedewald formula. Direct LDL-C measurement does not require fasting. Other recent guidelines on screening for
dyslipidemia in children have recommended measuring either LDL-C or non–HDL-C levels.
Interventions for dyslipidemia include lifestyle modification (eg, changes in diet and physical activity) and pharmacotherapy
(eg, statins, bile acid–sequestering agents, or cholesterol absorption inhibitors). The appropriate age at which to start statin use is
subject to debate. The long-term benefits and harms of statin use in children and adolescents are unknown.
The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient and that the balance of benefits and harms of screening for lipid
disorders in asymptomatic children and adolescents 20 years or younger cannot be determined.
The USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen for obesity in children 6 years or older and offer them or refer them to a comprehensive,
intensive behavioral intervention (B recommendation). The USPSTF found insufficient evidence on screening for primary hypertension
in asymptomatic children and adolescents to prevent subsequent cardiovascular disease in childhood or adulthood (I statement).
These recommendations are available on the USPSTF website (http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org).

ChildrenwithfamilialhypercholesterolemiacanhaveTCandLDL-C
levels 2 to 3 times higher than those of unaffected children. Famil-
ialhypercholesterolemiaisgenerallyasymptomaticinchildhoodand
adolescence and is rarely associated with cardiovascular events in
the first 2 decades of life.1 The burden of familial hypercholesterol-
emia is attributable to premature cardiovascular events in adult-
hood resulting from long-term exposure to elevated serum choles-
terol levels and atherosclerosis.
Studies conducted before statin use became common suggest
that familial hypercholesterolemia is associated with a cumulative
incidenceofischemicheartdiseasein1of6menand1of10women
by age 40 years. By age 50 years, 25% of women and 50% of men
with untreated familial hypercholesterolemia will experience clini-
cal cardiovascular disease.5 Coronary artery disease occurs in 50%
ofmenbyage50yearsand30%ofwomenbyage60years.7,8Mor-
talityfromcoronaryarterydiseaseisgreaterinadultsyoungerthan
60 years with familial hypercholesterolemia. Among adults surviv-
ing to age 60 years, the risk of coronary heart disease approaches
that of the general population.1,9
MultifactorialdyslipidemiaisdefinedbyelevatedlevelsofLDL-C
(�130 mg/dL) or TC (�200 mg/dL) that are not attributable to fa-
milialhypercholesterolemia.2Severallongitudinalstudieshavedocu-
mented an association between childhood lipid levels in this range
and measures of atherosclerosis in adulthood.1 Studies show that
tracking lipid levels from childhood and adolescence to adulthood
cannot predict which individuals will have elevated LDL-C or TC as
adults.2 In addition, the association between multifactorial dyslip-
idemiainchildhoodandadolescenceandclinicalcardiovasculardis-
ease in adulthood is unknown.

and treatment. The adverse effects of long-term use of lipid-
loweringpharmacotherapyandlifestylemodification(includingdiet
and physical activity) have not been adequately studied.
Current Practice
Generally, screening rates for dyslipidemia in children and adoles-
cents seen in primary care have been low. According to the Na-
tional Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 2.5% of well-child visits in-
cluded lipid testing in 1995, and 3.2% included it in 2010.10 Claims
data from health insurance plans report rare use of lipid-lowering
pharmacotherapy in 8- to 20-year-olds. Among more than 13 mil-
lion children, 665 children initiated lipid-lowering pharmaco-
therapy between 2005 and 2010, for an overall incidence rate of
2.6 prescriptions per 100 000 person-years (95% CI, 0.1 to 2.7).11
Screening Tests
Normal lipid level values for children and adolescents are currently
defined by population distributions of lipid levels from the Lipid
Research Clinics Prevalence Study, which was conducted in the
1970s.2,12 In 1992, the National Cholesterol Education Program
(NCEP) proposed fixed threshold values to define dyslipidemia
in children (TC �200 mg/dL, LDL-C �130 mg/dL, or both). These
values are slightly lower than the 95th percentile observed in the
Lipid Research Clinics Prevalence Study for both boys and girls at
nearly all ages, although there are some age-related variations in
adolescence.2,13
Cholesterol levels vary by sex and age throughout childhood.
Total cholesterol levels increase from birth, stabilize at approxi-
mately age 2 years, peak before puberty, and then decline slightly
duringadolescence.2,14TheacceptedcutoffvaluesforelevatedLDL-C
and TC may overidentify or underidentify children and adoles-
cents,dependingonageandsex.2Abnormallipidlevelsinyouthare
basedonpopulationdistributions,notassociationswithhealthout-
comes. It is unclear to what degree elevated lipid levels in children
andadolescents20yearsoryoungerareassociatedwithfuturedis-
ease risk.
Elevated lipid levels track modestly into adulthood, making it
difficult to predict which children and adolescents will continue to
have elevated cholesterol levels as adults.2,15,16 Longitudinal stud-
ies suggest that elevated LDL-C levels in adolescence predict el-
evated LDL-C 15 to 20 years later, with a positive predictive value
of 32.9% to 37.3% and lower predictive values among younger
children.17
Levels of TC may be measured with fasting or nonfasting
serum testing. Serum (or plasma) TC and HDL-C levels do not
change appreciably according to a fasting or nonfasting state. Se-
rum LDL-C levels may be calculated using the Friedewald formula
(LDL-C = TC − [triglycerides/5] − HDL-C). Because accurate calcu-
lation depends on triglyceride levels, serum testing requires a fast-
ingstate.DirectmeasurementofLDL-Cdoesnotrequirefastingand
is preferred when triglyceride levels are greater than 400 mg/dL.2
Recent guidelines on screening for dyslipidemia in children recom-
mend measuring either LDL-C or non–HDL-C levels.18
Screening strategies for dyslipidemia in clinical practice
include selective or universal screening. Selective screening is
based on family history of dyslipidemia or premature cardiovas-
cular disease. Universal screening is based only on age. Cascade
screening is a common screening strategy for familial hypercho-
lesterolemia in other countries. Cascade screening involves case-
finding among relatives of patients with confirmed familial hyper-
cholesterolemia and testing for genetic variants identified in the
first affected relative (ie, the proband). However, the US health
system does not currently have the infrastructure to implement
cascade screening.2
There are no universally accepted criteria for the diagnosis of
familial hypercholesterolemia. Studies of children and adolescents
with familial hypercholesterolemia use several different diagnostic
criteria. All of the criteria use a combination of elevated lipid levels,
physical findings, family history, or genetic tests to establish the
diagnosis.1
Treatment of Dyslipidemia
Interventions for dyslipidemia include lifestyle modification
(eg, changes in diet and physical activity) and pharmacotherapy
(eg, statins, bile acid–sequestering agents, or cholesterol absorp-
tion inhibitors).
Statins, or 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase
inhibitors, have been widely adopted for use in adults with hyper-
cholesterolemia, because these drugs are effective at reducing car-
diovascular events in high-risk adults. As a result of their efficacy in

adults, statins are one of the first-line medications considered for
use in children and adolescents with hypercholesterolemia.2,19
The appropriate age at which to start statin use in children
with familial hypercholesterolemia is subject to debate. Some
experts recommend starting statin use at age 8 or 10 years; oth-
ers, concerned with adverse effects, recommend initiating use at
age 20 years.2 The long-term effects of statin use in children and
adolescents are unknown.
Useful Resources
The USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen for obesity in chil-
dren 6 years or older and offer them or refer them to a comprehen-
sive, intensive behavioral intervention (B recommendation).20
The USPSTF found insufficient evidence on screening for primary
hypertension in asymptomatic children and adolescents to pre-
vent subsequent cardiovascular disease in childhood or adulthood
(I statement).21 These recommendations are available on the
USPSTF website (http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org).
Other Considerations
Research Needs and Gaps
Randomized trials of screening programs are needed to assess the
benefits and harms of combined screening and treatment pro-
grams for familial hypercholesterolemia in children and adoles-
cents. For both familial hypercholesterolemia and multifactorial
dyslipidemia, long-term, controlled treatment trials of lipid-
lowering medications, supplements, dietary interventions, or com-
binations thereof are needed to assess harms, as well as effective-
ness to improve intermediate and health outcomes in adulthood.1,2
These trials should be conducted in racially and ethnically diverse
US populations. In the absence of randomized clinical trials (RCTs)
of screening programs, treatment studies in patients with screen-
detected multifactorial dyslipidemia would be informative. In addi-
tion, longitudinal studies would help to understand the association
between intermediate outcomes in childhood and adolescence and
premature myocardial infarction and stroke in adulthood.1,2 With
these studies, it may be possible to consider age- and sex-specific
(rather than fixed) cutoff values to define thresholds for abnormal
levels of TC and LDL-C.2

Discussion
Burden of Disease
Data from the 2011-2012 NHANES estimate the prevalence of el-
evatedTClevelsinchildrenaged8to17yearsas7.8%,anddatafrom
the2007-2010NHANESestimatetheprevalenceofelevatedLDL-C

true prevalence of dyslipidemia because of within-person variabil-
ity.Repeattestinginanindividualisnecessarytoreliablyidentifychil-
dren and adolescents with elevated lipid levels.2,4,5,12
Much attention has been directed at screening for dyslipid-
emia in childhood and adolescence because atherosclerosis starts
in youth; lipid levels in youth are associated with the extent of
atherosclerosis in adulthood; familial hypercholesterolemia is
associated with premature ischemic cardiovascular disease;
short-term treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia with stat-
ins substantially lowers LDL-C levels and, based on 1 study,
improves measures of atherosclerosis; abnormal lipid levels in
adulthood have been strongly associated with the risk of coro-
nary heart disease events; and early identification and interven-
tion with cholesterol-lowering therapy in certain populations of
adults can prevent such events.
Screening in children and adolescents may identify those with
undiagnosedfamilialhypercholesterolemiaormultifactorialdyslip-
idemia. However, the clinical health benefits and risks among chil-
dren and adolescents identified with and treated for dyslipidemia
have not been sufficiently studied, making the role of screening in
children and adolescents uncertain.
Scope of Review
To update its 2007 recommendation,23 the USPSTF commissioned
2systematicevidencereviewsonscreeningforlipiddisordersinchil-
dren and adolescents 20 years or younger. The USPSTF decided to
conduct2separatereviewsbasedonpubliccommentonthedraftre-
search plan—1 on screening for familial hypercholesterolemia and
1 on screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia. The review on familial
hypercholesterolemia focused on heterozygous familial hypercho-
lesterolemia. Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and sec-
ondary causes of dyslipidemia (such as diabetes, nephrotic syn-
drome, or hypothyroidism) were outside the scope of the review.
Accuracy of Screening Tests
Familial Hypercholesterolemia
The review identified 2 fair-quality studies of universal screening
for familial hypercholesterolemia. Both studies took place in school
settings. The first study, the Coronary Artery Risk Detection in
Appalachian Communities (CARDIAC) project, was a universal
screening program (n = 81 156) in West Virginia schools intended to
identify the prevalence of cardiac risk factors, such as obesity, dys-
lipidemia, hypertension, and glucose intolerance.24 The second
study was a Danish screening study (n = 2085) that measured apo-
lipoprotein levels as a screening test for familial hypercholesterol-
emia. No studies on selective screening for familial hypercholester-
olemia were identified.1,25
The CARDIAC project reported a diagnostic yield of about 1.3
cases per 1000 persons screened when familial hypercholesterol-
emia was diagnosed based on an LDL-C level greater than
155 mg/dL, a TC level greater than 260 mg/dL, or both, plus DNA
evidence of a genetic mutation in a first- or second-degree
relative.24 The Danish study identified 10 children based on labo-
ratory testing and a family history consistent with familial hyper-
cholesterolemia, for a diagnostic yield of 4.8 cases per 1000 per-
sons screened.1,25
Multifactorial Dyslipidemia
Nostudiesonselectivescreeningformultifactorialdyslipidemiawere
identified. No studies screened for multifactorial dyslipidemia by
measuring levels of non–HDL-C.

Effectiveness of Early Detection and Treatment
Familial Hypercholesterolemia
No direct evidence was found that reported on selective or univer-
sal screening and intermediate or health outcomes in children and
adolescents with familial hypercholesterolemia.
Thirteenrandomized,blindedtrials(n = 1789)examinedtheef-
fectiveness of lipid-lowering pharmacotherapy in children and ado-
lescents.Noevidenceontheeffectivenessofdietarysupplementsor
lifestyle interventions on intermediate outcomes in children with fa-
milial hypercholesterolemia was found. The 13 fair- to good-quality
trialsincluded8trialsofstatins,3trialsofbileacid–sequesteringagents,
and 2 trials of a cholesterol absorption inhibitor.1
Trials included 54 to 248 participants whose ages ranged from
6 to 18 years (mean age range, 12-15 years). Both sexes were well
represented. In trials reporting race/ethnicity, the majority of trial
participants were white. The trials were conducted in countries
with a high Human Development Index (>0.9). Participants were
patients at tertiary care lipid clinics. Trial duration ranged from 6
weeks to 2 years, with most lasting less than 1 year. All trials
excluded participants with homozygous familial hypercholesterol-
emia, secondary dyslipidemia, or use of medications that could
affect lipid levels. Familial hypercholesterolemia was defined on the
basis of elevated fasting lipid levels and family history, using various
standard criteria.1
Statin trials included pravastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin, ator-
vastatin,androsuvastatin.Thestudiesreportedstatisticallysignifi-
cantreductionsinLDL-Clevelsfrombaseline,withmosteffectsizes
ranging from 20% to 40% compared with placebo. Because of the
variability in medication, dosage, and duration of treatment, data
were not pooled across trials.1
Dose response was seen in 2 trials of pravastatin and
rosuvastatin.1 The greatest effect on levels of LDL-C was in a trial of
rosuvastatin. In that trial—the only statin trial that reported treat-
menttargetlevels—only12%to41%ofparticipantsreachedthetar-
getLDL-Cleveloflessthan110mg/dL,withgreatereffectsathigher

line, compared with 1% in the control group (P < .001). The effects

groups (P = .02).1 No trials assessed the effect of statins on patho-
logic findings or coronary calcium scores.
Threetrialsofbileacid–sequesteringagents(colesevelam,cho-
lestyramine, and colestipol) reported more modest effects on lev-
els of LDL-C and TC, with similar effect sizes across trials. The trial
of colesevelam showed a dose response. Only 3.2% to 7.9% of par-
ticipants reached the target LDL-C level of 110 mg/dL or less, with
greater effects at higher doses.1
One drug, an intestinal cholesterol absorption inhibitor (ezeti-
mibe, studied in 2 RCTs), also showed smaller effects on levels of
LDL-C in a trial of combination therapy with simvastatin. Ezetimibe
reduced LDL-C by 54% compared with a 38% reduction using sim-
vastatin alone. In a trial assessing ezetimibe monotherapy com-
pared with placebo, ezetimibe reduced LDL-C by 28% (95% CI, −31
to −25) from baseline compared with a negligible change in the pla-
cebo group.1

Multifactorial Dyslipidemia
No direct evidence was found that evaluated selective or universal

There is also a lack of evidence on the effectiveness of treat-
ment in childhood on adult health outcomes. However, 2 trials ad-
dressed the effectiveness of treatment on intermediate outcomes
in children with multifactorial dyslipidemia.2
A good-quality trial, the Dietary Intervention Study in Children
(n = 663), evaluated a modified NCEP Step II diet (low fat and low
cholesterol) delivered using an intensive multiyear, family-based
counseling intervention in children aged 8 to 10 years.27 Trial par-
ticipantshadameanbaselineLDL-Clevelof131mg/dL,whichisnear

(about8yearsafterrandomization),and9yearsaftertheendofthe
trial (about 17 years after randomization). The intervention re-

Onefair-qualitylongitudinalstudy(n = 9245)ofadolescentsand
young adults (aged 12 to 39 years) from the NHANES evaluated the
association between mortality before age 55 years and several car-
diovascular risk factors, including lipid levels. In multivariate mod-
els, neither highly elevated TC (�240 mg/dL) nor moderately in-
creased TC (200-239 mg/dL) was independently associated with
death (all causes and endogenous causes) when both sexes were
combined. Extremely elevated TC (�240 mg/dL) was associated
withagreaterriskofdeath(endogenouscauses)beforeage55years
(relative hazard ratio, 2.58 [95% CI, 1.31 to 5.08]) in females only.
However, this estimate was based on a small number of deaths.29

Potential Harms of Screening and Treatment
Familial Hypercholesterolemia
No studies reported on the harms of screening for familial hyper-
cholesterolemia in children and adolescents. Evidence was avail-
able from short-term trials of pharmacotherapy in children and
adolescents with familial hypercholesterolemia. The USPSTF evalu-
ated 18 fair- to good-quality trials (n = 2210) for the harms of
treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia in children and adoles-
cents, including 13 trials of statins, 3 trials of bile acid–sequestering
agents, and 2 trials of a cholesterol absorption inhibitor (ezeti-
mibe). Most were applicable to the US primary health care
setting. Trial duration ranged from 8 weeks to 2 years.1 Bile acid–
sequestering agents were commonly associated with gastrointesti-
nal symptoms and poor palatability. Statins were well tolerated;
elevated liver enzyme levels, creatine kinase levels, or both were
observed in some studies but were transient. Ten trials evaluated
the effects of statin use on growth or sexual maturation and found
no reported abnormalities. Ezetimibe was well tolerated in short-
term trials.1
Overall,evidenceoftreatmentharmswaslimitedtoonly1long-
termstudy.Thestudywasa10-yearcohortfollow-upofa2-yeartrial
of pravastatin followed by continued statin use over the interven-
ing years. Sex hormone levels were measured in young adult sib-
lings (mean age, 24 years). Young men with familial hypercholes-
terolemiahadlowerdehydroepiandrosteronesulfatelevels(within
normal ranges) compared with their unaffected siblings. However,
this difference is of unknown clinical significance.30
Multifactorial Dyslipidemia
No studies were found that reported on the harms of screening for
multifactorial dyslipidemia in children and adolescents.
The only trial that evaluated harms of treatment in children
with multifactorial dyslipidemia was the Dietary Intervention Study
in Children, which evaluated a dietary intervention combined with
behavioral counseling in children with multifactorial dyslipidemia.
This good-quality trial demonstrated no harms in anthropometric,
laboratory, psychosocial, or sexual maturation measures during the
trial or long-term follow-up (18 years), suggesting that low-fat, low-
cholesterol dietary interventions may not be harmful in children.2
Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the quantitative differ-
ence in diagnostic yield between universal and selective screening
approaches.Thereisinadequateevidenceontheeffectivenessand
harms of long-term treatment and the harms of screening. The
USPSTF also found inadequate evidence on the association be-
tween changes in intermediate outcomes (eg, lipid levels or nonin-
vasivemeasuresofatherosclerosis)andimprovementsinadultcar-
diovascularhealthoutcomes.Therefore,theUSPSTFconcludesthat
the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for lipid disor-
ders in children and adolescents 20 years or younger is insufficient
and that the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.
How Does the Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?
Left untreated, familial hypercholesterolemia leads to premature
clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in adulthood result-
ing from long-term exposure to elevated levels of serum choles-
terol.Cardiovasculareventsrarelyoccurinthefirst2decadesoflife,
typically taking place during the fourth decade. Because of the lack
of evidence on the long-term benefits and harms of pharmaco-
therapy, it is not known whether there is benefit to initiating treat-
mentinchildhoodvslaterinadolescenceoradulthood.Itisalsonot
knownifimprovementinintermediateoutcomesresultsinimprove-
ment in adult health outcomes.
Multifactorialdyslipidemiainchildhoodandadolescenceisarisk
factor for future atherosclerosis. Although elevated lipid levels can
continue into adulthood, they do so inconsistently, making it diffi-
culttopredictwhichchildrenandadolescentswillhaveelevatedcho-
lesterol as adults. The relationship between dyslipidemia and coro-
naryheartdiseaseinadultshasbeenwellestablished;however,the
associationbetweenmultifactorialdyslipidemiainchildrenandado-
lescents and future disease risk in adults is unknown.
