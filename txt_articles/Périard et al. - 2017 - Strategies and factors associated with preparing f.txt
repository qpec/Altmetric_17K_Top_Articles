ABSTRACT
Purpose Assess exertional heat illness (EHI) history and
preparedness in athletes competing in a World Athletics
Championships under hot/humid conditions and identify
the factors associated with preparedness strategies.
Methods Of the 207 registered national teams invited
to participate in the study, 50 (24%) accepted. The 957
athletes (49% of all 1965 registered) in these teams
were invited to complete a precompetition questionnaire
evaluating EHI history, heat stress prevention (heat
acclimatisation, precooling and hydration) and recovery.
Responses from 307 (32%) athletes were separated in
field events, sprints, middle-distance and long-distance
running, and decathlon/heptathlon for analysis.
Results 48% of athletes had previously experienced
EHI symptoms and 8.5% had been diagnosed with EHI.
15% heat acclimatised (∼20 days) before the
championships. 52% had a precooling strategy, ice slurry
ingestion (24%) being the most prevalent and women
using it more frequently than men (p=0.005). 96% of
athletes had a fluid consumption strategy, which differed
between event categories (p<0.001). The most common
volumes planned on being consumed were 0.5–1 L
(27.2%) and ≥2 L (21.8%), water being the most
frequent. 89% of athletes planned on using at least one
recovery strategy. Female sex (p=0.024) and a previous
EHI diagnosis increased the likelihood of using all 3
prevention strategies (p<0.001).
Conclusions At a World Championships with expected
hot/humid conditions, less than one-fifth of athletes heat
acclimatised, half had a precooling strategy and almost
all a hydration plan. Women, and especially athletes
with an EHI history, were more predisposed to use a
complete heat stress prevention strategy. More
information regarding heat acclimatisation should be
provided to protect athlete health and optimise
performance at major athletics competitions in the heat.
INTRODUCTION
The 15th International Association of Athletics
Federations (IAAF) W
orld Championships were
held in Beijing (China) from 22 to 30 of August
2015. Based on weather patterns from the previous
10 years, it was anticipated that the event would be
held in warm/hot and humid conditions, with
mean and maximum daily temperatures of ∼26°C
and ∼33°C, respectively, and a relative humidity of
∼73%.1
Under
such
environmental
conditions,
there is potential for both the performance and
health of athletes to be compromised, leading to
impairments in exercise capacity and possibly to
exertional heat illness (EHI).
From a performance perspective, the influence of
hot environmental conditions is largely related to
exercise duration. For example, an increase in core
and particularly muscle temperature is beneficial to
performance (ie, the production of maximal force
and power) during brief explosive efforts such as
jumping and sprinting.2 In contrast, large incre-
ments in core and skin temperature (ie, thermal
strain) are associated with impaired endurance per-
formance due to an increase in thermoregulatory
function exacerbating the cardiovascular response.3 4
Severe dehydration via excessive sweating further
exacerbates the influence of heat stress on perform-
ance through a loss of plasma volume, causing
hypovolaemia.5
The development of EHI may be viewed as
occurring along a continuum, from relatively mild
symptoms such as muscle cramps to heat exhaus-
tion and to the more serious and life-threatening
condition of exertional heatstroke.6
7 Although
hyperthermia
and
dehydration
can
influence
aerobic performance and lead to EHI, specific
interventions such as heat acclimatisation and pre-
cooling can allow athletes to minimise the loss in
performance associated with competing in hot
ambient conditions.8 The IOC recently highlighted
the need to characterise the sport and event-specific
profiles of international athletes competing in the
heat in a consensus statement.9 Indeed, while core
temperature and heart rate have been monitored in
amateur runners during a half-marathon10 and the
impact of weather on marathon performance has
been
described
for
different
populations,11
it
remains unknown whether elite track and field ath-
letes follow so-called ‘best practice’ approaches
when
preparing
to
compete
in
the
heat.
Understanding how elite athletes from various dis-
ciplines and global regions prepare for a major
competition in the heat may help guide future prac-
tice and research.
Therefore, this study aimed to assess the EHI
history, preparedness and recovery of athletes com-
peting in the championships under potentially hot/
humid conditions, as well as to identify the factors
associated with different preparedness strategies.
Preparation was assessed based on the athletes
training in the heat prior to the championships,
along with using precooling and fluid consumption
strategies during competition. It was hypothesised

 that individuals having experienced EHI and athletes competing
in endurance-type events would more commonly adopt heat
stress prevention strategies.
METHODS
Participants
A cohort study design was used to collect data during the IAAF
W
orld Athletics Championships in Beijing 2015. Of the 207
registered national teams invited to participate in the study, 50
(24%) accepted. The 957 athletes in these teams (49% of the
1965 registered athletes) were invited to complete a precompeti-
tion heat strategy questionnaire. Information about the purpose
of the study was provided to the athletes during the accredit-
ation procedure. A total of 307 (32%) athletes accepted to par-
ticipate. The athletes were separated in five event categories:
field (ie, jumps and throws), sprints (ie, 100, 200, 400 m,
including hurdles and relays), middle distance (ie, 800, 1500
and
3000 m
steeplechase),
long
distance
(ie,
5000
and
10 000 m, marathon and race walking) and decathlon/heptath-
lon. The characteristics of the athletes in each event category are
presented in table 1. The protocol for the study was approved
by the Anti-Doping Lab Qatar Institutional Review Board
(F2015000074). All procedures conformed to the standards of
the Declaration of Helsinki.
Data collection
Participants completed a precompetition heat strategy question-
naire in the days prior to competing in their event after arriving
in Beijing. The questionnaire was translated into the six IAAF
official languages (English, French, Russian, Japanese, Spanish
and Arabic). The questionnaire consisted of seven multiple-
choice questions addressing the themes of heat illness, heat
acclimatisation (≤35 days), cooling, hydration and recovery (see
online supplementary appendix). Five of the questions had a
section with the possibility for additional information to be pro-
vided. The questionnaire was intended to gain an understanding
of the approach used by elite athletes and their coaches ahead
of a major competition likely to be held in hot and humid con-
ditions. The questionnaire focused on strategies used in the
preparation, competition and recovery phases of the champion-
ships. Participating athletes completed the questionnaire on
print paper, after receiving instructions from on-field research-
ers. In-championship heat illness was defined according to the
consensus on injury and illness reporting in athletics.12 Newly
incurred
injuries
and
illnesses
were
recorded
by
national
medical teams and/or by physicians on the local organising com-
mittee using procedures established at previous champion-
ships.13
14 Ambient air temperature and W
et Bulb Globe
T
emperature
(WBGT:
Kestrel
4400,
Nielsen-Kellerman,
Boothwyn, USA) were measured in the warm-up area and
stadium throughout each day for the duration of the champion-
ships, as well as during the marathon and race walking events.
Definition of heat stress prevention
Four different measures of heat stress prevention were defined:
(1) ‘Having trained in the heat before the championships’, (2)
‘Planning to use a precooling method before the competition’,
(3) ‘Planning to consume fluids during the competition’, and (4)
‘All of (1), (2) and (3)’.
Statistical analysis
Differences of proportions of heat stress prevention strategies
over different home continent, sex and event category were
examined using χ2 tests with ϕ as effect size (ϕ=0.1 was consid-
ered a small effect, ϕ=0.3 a medium effect and ϕ=0.5 a large
effect). An analysis of non-participating athletes was performed
by comparing their distribution of home continent, the Human
Development Index (HDI),15 sex and age with the final study
group. Examination of potential factors explaining the use of
heat stress prevention strategies at the championship was per-
formed using logistic regression analysis. First, analyses were
performed with simple models (ie, logistic regression analyses
with 1 explanatory variable). Thereafter, analyses were per-
formed with multiple models (ie, logistic regression analyses
with several explanatory variables) for each of the four defini-
tions of heat stress prevention. The multiple models were fitted
using stepwise elimination of non-significant variables. The
explanatory variables were sex, age, home continent, the HDI,
event category, availability of medical support before the cham-
pionships, experience of previous heat-related symptoms, and
previously having been diagnosed with EHI. Events for these
models were coded into two categories: speed/power (field,
sprints and decathlon/heptathlon) and endurance (middle and
long distance) events. All statistical calculations were performed
using SPSS Statistics for Windows, V
.21.0 (IBM Corporation,
Armonk, New York, USA). All statistical tests were two-sided
and outcomes with p<0.05 were regarded as statistically signifi-
cant. Data are presented as mean±SD.
RESULTS
The distribution of athletes completing the questionnaire per
continent was 11.1% from Africa, 18.2% from Asia, 2.6% from
Australia, 32.9% from Europe, 14.3% from North America and
20.8% from South America. A comparison of the participating
and non-participating athletes revealed that while sex showed
no significant difference between groups, non-participation was
slightly higher in athletes over 25 years (p=0.040), in African
athletes (p<0.001) and among athletes from developing coun-
tries according to the HDI (p=0.037).
Environmental conditions and EHI
Mean daily temperature and WBGT during the championships
were 27±3°C and 24±2°C at 8:00, 31±3°C and 27±2°C at
12:00, and 30±4°C and 25±2°C at 16:00. Five (1.6%) of the
athletes participating in the study were diagnosed with symp-
toms (eg, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, palpitations and syncope)
associated with EHI (eg, exhaustion, dehydration) during the
championships.
Heat illness symptoms and diagnosis
Approximately half (47.6%) of the athletes responding to the
questionnaire reported having previously experienced at least

 one heat illness symptom, whereas 17% reported two or more
symptoms (table 2). Event category influenced the prevalence of
experiencing severe headaches during training and/or competing
in the heat (p=0.049, ϕ=0.18), with a greater fraction of
middle-distance
runners
and
decathlon/heptathlon
athletes
reporting this symptom. Nausea (p=0.065, ϕ=0.11) and severe
headaches (p=0.079, ϕ=0.10) tended to be symptoms more
often reported in women than men during training and/or com-
peting in the heat. Of the 26 athletes (8.5%) reporting a previ-
ous
diagnosis
of
EHI,
3
(11.5%)
reported
having
been
diagnosed with both dehydration and heat exhaustion.
Heat training
In preparation for the championships, 15.3% of the athletes sur-
veyed reported having prepared specifically by training in the
heat. No significant differences in heat acclimatisation were
observed for home continent, sex and event category. In the field
events, 15.8% of athletes trained in a natural hot environment,
17.0% of sprint athletes, 13.5% of middle-distance athletes,
12.8% of long-distance athletes and 16.7% of decathlon/
heptathlon athletes also reported following a heat acclimatisation
regimen. The length of the regimen varied between 17±10 days
(field events), 18±10 days (sprints), 18±11 days (middle dis-
tance), 23±10 days (long distance) and 30±0 days (decathletes/
heptathletes). In addition, two long-distance athletes reported
training indoors in an artificially hot environment (ie, heat
acclimation) for 11 and 12 days, respectively.
Precooling
Approximately half (52.4%) of the athletes reported having at
least one prearranged cooling strategy, 10.4% having two strat-
egies and 4.9% having three strategies (table 3). Event category
influenced the use (or not) of a strategy (p=0.012, ϕ=0.19), as
well
as
use
of
an
ice
vest
(p<0.001,
ϕ=0.32),
with
a
small-to-medium effect on the use of a neck collar (p=0.055,
ϕ=0.17) and whole-body cold-water immersion (p=0.074,
ϕ=0.17). W
omen reported using ice slurry or cold drink inges-
tion (p=0.005, ϕ=01.6) and neck collars (p=0.050, ϕ=0.11)
more frequently than did men.
Hydration
The analysis revealed differences among event categories for the
volume of fluids planned on being consumed (p<0.001,
ϕ=0.56). The most commonly reported volumes were 0.5–1 L
(27.2%) and 2 L or more (21.8%; table 3). The preferred fluid
composition for hydration was water, with medium-to-large dif-
ferences for drinking water (p<0.001, ϕ=0.26), electrolytes
(p=0.004, ϕ=0.22) and carbohydrates (p<0.001, ϕ=0.34)
between event categories. W
omen preferred to consume water
more than men (p=0.016, ϕ=0.14).
Recovery
Most athletes planned on only using one recovery strategy
(26.1%), with 23.5%, 17.9% and 13.7% planning on using
two, three and four strategies, respectively, while 7.5% planned
on using five or more recovery strategies (table 3). There were
differences between event categories in the use (or not) of
recovery strategies (p=0.001, ϕ=0.24), including active reco-
very (p=0.021, ϕ=0.19), cold-water immersion (p=0.002,
ϕ=0.24), electrostimulation (p=0.049, ϕ=0.18) and compres-
sion garments (p=0.078, ϕ=0.17). W
omen reported planning
the use of recovery strategies more frequently than men
(p=0.017, ϕ=0.14), with a greater use of massage therapy
(p=0.025, ϕ=0.13).

 Explanatory models
The simple model analyses showed that sex (females: 20.0%,
males: 11.6%) (odds ratio (OR) 1.90; p=0.045), a history of
experiencing heat illness symptoms (OR 1.88; p=0.048) and a
previous diagnosis of EHI (OR 7.27; p<0.001) increased the
likelihood of training in the heat prior to the championships
(table 4). In the multiple model, only the associations between
the sex of the athlete and previous EHI diagnosis remained.
The simple model analyses showed that precooling was influ-
enced by sex (females: 57.8% and males: 48.3%) (OR 1.64;
p=0.034), event category (OR 1.72; p=0.020), continent
(p<0.001), HDI (OR 2.44; p<0.001) and having previously
been diagnosed with EHI (OR 2.73; p=0.023) (table 5).
Athletes originating from Asia demonstrated an increased likeli-
hood of employing a precooling strategy (OR 2.33; p=0.015),
while those from South America showed a reduced likelihood
(OR 0.11; p<0.001). The multiple analyses showed that the
likelihood of using precooling was higher in women (OR 1.92;
p=0.014) and in athletes from Africa (OR 2.44; p=0.035) and
Asia (OR 2.66; p=0.006), but lower in South American athletes
(OR 0.12; p<0.001).
Athletes competing in endurance events demonstrated a
lower likelihood of using a planned fluid consumption strategy
in the simple and multiple analysis models (OR 0.30; p<0.001)
(table 6).
The simple heat stress prevention model analyses revealed
that
sex
(females:
14.8%
and
males:
5.2%)
(OR
2.61;
p=0.026), home continent (p=0.024) and a previous diagnosis
of EHI (OR 8.22; p<0.001) were associated with adopting a
strategy which included: heat acclimatisation, precooling and a
fluid consumption strategy (table 7). Athletes from South
America (OR 0.12; p=0.042) were less likely to adopt such a
strategy. In the multiple model, only athlete sex (OR 2.77;
p=0.024) and a previous diagnosis of EHI (OR 8.64; p<0.001)
remained.
DISCUSSION
The aim of this study was to evaluate the history of EHI and
preparedness of athletes competing in the 2015 IAAF W
orld
Athletics Championships in Beijing under potentially hot/humid
ambient conditions, and to identify the factors associated with
adopting different heat stress prevention strategies using a pre-
competition questionnaire. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first report describing the preparation of elite-level athletes
competing in such a high-profile event. Our results indicate that
approximately half of the athletes participating in the study had
previously experienced heat illness symptoms (eg, cramping,
severe headaches) and 8.5% had been diagnosed with EHI,
most commonly dehydration. Only 15% of athletes reported
having prepared specifically for the championships by undertak-
ing heat training regimens (mean duration: ∼20 days). It was
also observed that precooling in a variety of forms was adopted
by half of the athletes. The volume of fluids planned on being
consumed during competition varied considerably, with field
and sprint athletes mostly planning on consuming 0.5–1 L,
middle-distance
and
long-distance
athletes
a
mixture
of
volumes, and decathletes/heptathletes more than 2 L. The com-
position of the fluids consumed was mainly water with some
electrolytes. A quarter of the athletes planned on using one
recovery strategy and another quarter a combination of strat-
egies (eg, massage, stretching, cold-water immersion). These
data indicate that fluid consumption was an integral part of the
approach for almost all athletes (96%) competing at the W
orld
Championships, followed by precooling (52%) and training in
the heat (15%). The most common explanatory variables asso-
ciated with adopting multiple heat stress prevention strategies
were a previous diagnosis of EHI and the sex of the athlete,
with women displaying a higher likelihood.
Our data demonstrate a personal history of cramping as being
the most prevalent heat illness symptom reported, with a rela-
tively low incidence of having previously been diagnosed with
severe
EHI
(ie,
heat
stroke;
table
2).
During
the
2015
Championships, five of the athletes participating in the study
were reported as having experienced issues related to EHI. Of
these
athletes,
two
had
previously
experienced
symptoms
related to EHI during training and/or competing in the heat;
however, none had been diagnosed with EHI. Three of the ath-
letes participated in endurance events, one in a middle-distance
race and the other in a field event. T
wo athletes had prepared by
heat acclimatising, three had a precooling strategy, all had a
hydration plan, and four a recovery strategy. Interestingly, the
two athletes who had previously experienced EHI symptoms are
the ones who heat acclimatised. Given that several risk factors
are
linked
with
the
development
of
EHI—environmental
factors, medications, drug use, compromised health status and

 experience EHI symptoms, despite preparing for the champion-
ships by training in the heat. Although there may be an
increased likelihood of experiencing EHI when participating in
high-intensity endurance events, our data suggest that athletes in
shorter races and field events are also likely to be susceptible to
EHI. Additional research is thus warranted to determine the
potential markers indicative of EHI predisposition.
Nevertheless, <2% of the athletes participating in the study
were reported as having experienced EHI symptoms. This may
relate to the WBGT remaining between 23°C and 28°C during
the championships, a range associated with a high but not
extreme (≥28°C) risk for EHI.16 17 The WBGT is an environ-
mental heat stress index and not a representation of human heat
strain. As such, it may not represent the environmental condi-
tions in which the limit of compensation is exceeded in different
events, which depends on several factors (eg, metabolic heat
production,
athlete
morphology,
acclimatisation
state
and
clothing).8 Nevertheless, these data are in line with a previous
surveillance study examining the risk of heat illness in profes-
sional beach volleyball over a 3-year period.18 The authors
observed that the risk of significant heat illness was very low,
even though hot and humid conditions were encountered fre-
quently, with only three cases of a medical forfeiture related to
heat stress. This most likely reflects the high level of fitness of
elite athletes and some degree of adaptation to heat.
It has been suggested that heat acclimatisation is the most
important intervention one can adopt to reduce physiological
strain and optimise performance is to heat.8 Heat acclimatisation
reduces the risk of EHI, as well as induces physiological adapta-
tions that improve thermoregulation, attenuate physiological
strain and improve aerobic performance in warm/hot environ-
ments.19 20 It is interesting to note that a similar or even slightly
lower per cent of middle-distance and long-distance athletes
reported having specifically prepared for the championships by

 training in the heat, relative to other event categories. Given
that longer duration events are the ones for which heat acclima-
tisation is most highly recommended,8 it was anticipated that a
greater fraction of these athletes would have acclimatised.
However, given that our data were separated by continent
rather than country, it was not possible to determine precisely
where the athletes originated from. It is thus conceivable that
many athletes live and train in warm/hot summer conditions
and
did
not
report
having
specifically
heat
acclimatised.
Although less than one-fifth of all athletes surveyed reported
undertaking a heat acclimatisation regimen, few experienced
EHI during the championships while competing in the ∼28°C
and ∼55% relative humidity conditions. While these conditions
can be considered warm to hot, they may not be overly oppres-
sive for well-trained individuals by virtue of regularly increasing
thermoregulatory strain when training at high intensities, and
consequently developing some heat adaptation.19
Indeed, well-trained individuals exercising at the same relative
intensity, but at a higher metabolic rate than untrained indivi-
duals, experience a greater rate of heat storage,21 22 but fatigue
at similar23 24 or higher core temperatures.25 26 Accordingly,
adaptations related to regular high-intensity training may allow
for higher rates of whole-body heat accumulation before a
reduction in work rate occurs.27 Moreover, aerobically fit indivi-
duals heat acclimatise more rapidly than those who are less fit
and may have a reduced susceptibility to heat injury/illness
(Gardner et al, 1996). Given that short-term heat acclimatisation
(<7 days) provides some performance-enhancing benefits,28 ath-
letes competing in the W
orld Championships may have adapted
to the heat during outdoor training sessions in the lead-up to
their event while in Beijing, thus reducing the susceptibility to
EHI and optimising performance. In the current study, the vari-
able associated with a greater likelihood of training in the heat
in preparation for the championships was a previous diagnosis
of EHI, whereas originating from South America was associated
with a lower likelihood (table 4). These observations highlight
the complexity and numerous factors that influence the prepar-
ation strategy of elite athletes. Therefore, it seems important
that all athletes receive appropriate information ahead of a
major event expected to take place in hot and/or humid condi-
tions regarding various preparation strategies, regardless of their
country of origin, sex and EHI history.
Precooling is an intervention that is becoming increasingly
popular with athletes looking to reduce thermal strain, minimise
fatigue and accelerate postexercise recovery. By cooling the skin
prior to competition (eg, ice vest), athletes can reduce cardiovas-
cular strain for a short period after the onset of exercise in the
heat.29 When whole-body cooling (eg, cold-water immersion) is
implemented, a decrease in organ and skeletal muscle tempera-
ture occurs. Although precooling in its various forms (ie,
internal and external) is interesting and appears to have been
adopted by several athletes at the 2015 W
orld Championships,
the effectiveness and practicality of various cooling techniques,
along with the physiological mechanisms underpinning the
improvements in performance, require further investigation.29 30
During the championships, the factors associated with a higher
likelihood of precooling were a previous diagnosis of EHI,
home continent (Africa and Asia), a lower level on the HDI, sex
(females 58% vs males 48%) and participating in endurance
events (table 5). In addition to showing a lower likelihood of
heat acclimatisation, athletes from South America also showed a
very low likelihood of using precooling techniques. This most
likely reflects a combination of factors, from the number of ath-
letes participating in endurance events, to the sex of these ath-
letes, and a previous diagnosis of EHI. Accordingly, further
research is required to better understand how these factors,
along with socioeconomic considerations, interact to influence
the preparation and use of various heat stress countermeasures
in athletes from different continents, as well as specific countries
in the lead-up to a major championships.
Athletes performing exercise in warm/hot and humid environ-
ments have elevated sweat rates which can result in large body
water and electrolyte deficits, exacerbating the performance
impairments associated with heat stress.5 Athletes competing in
the championships may have been aware of the impact that
hydration status may have on performance and recovery, as more

 than 80% had a fluid consumption strategy (table 3). This was
especially noticeable in the decathletes and heptathletes spending
the better part of an entire day on the track and field, consuming
water, as well as electrolytes and carbohydrates. However, it is
not possible to determine from the current data if the planned
hydration strategy of the athletes was different from their usual
strategy in cooler environments. Interestingly, endurance athletes
had a lower likelihood of adopting a fluid consumption strategy
than speed/power athletes (table 6). However, this most likely
relates to the decathletes and heptathletes having been included
in the speed/power athlete category of the explanatory models
and the nature of the question, which for some could have
included the warm-up and cool down (eg, sprints).
When combined into a heat stress prevention strategy using
training in the heat, precooling and having a fluid consumption
strategy, South American athletes appeared to be at a very low
likelihood of adopting such a strategy (table 7). However, the
previous diagnosis of EHI increased the likelihood of using a
combined heat stress prevention strategy eightfold.
Recovery between events/heats during an athletics competition
is essential for optimising physical and mental performance. With
a host of recovery options such as water immersion, compression
clothing, cryotherapy, sports massage and electrostimulation,31–34
it is not surprising to have observed that ∼25% of the athletes use
one recovery strategy and ∼63% at least two recovery strategies
(table 3). Although there exist many potential strategies to use
during competition, the ones most frequently employed were
massage, active recovery, stretching and cold-water immersion.
In summary, only 15% of the athletes surveyed prepared by
training
in
the
heat
ahead
of
the
2015
IAAF
W
orld
Championships in which hot/humid conditions were expected.
Approximately half had a precooling strategy, 96% a fluid con-
sumption strategy and over 89% a recovery strategy. Although
most athletes did not heat acclimatise prior to the champion-
ships, <2% experienced EHI symptoms. This may be attributed
to their high level of fitness, partly conferring adaptations
similar to heat acclimatisation, and to the other strategies and
interventions employed during competition. Having previously
experienced EHI and being female were strongly associated with
using
one
or
multiple
heat
stress
prevention
strategies.
Nevertheless, it is recommended that information regarding
heat acclimatisation as the primary countermeasure to protect
athlete health and optimise performance be disseminated ahead
of competitions to be held in hot/humid conditions to allow for
adequate preparation.
Study strengths and limitations
The major strength of this study is that, to the best of our
knowledge, it is the first to examine the history of EHI and pre-
paredness
of
elite-level
athletes
competing
in
a
W
orld
Championships in the heat, as well as to evaluate the predictors
associated with using heat stress preventing strategies. It should
be noted that there exist differences between a clinical diagnosis
of EHI and ‘feeling sick/uncomfortable in the heat’. Since these
concepts are not synonymous, the diagnostic criteria for EHI at
major athletics competitions should be agreed on and uniformly
applied. Although the overall response rate was relatively low
(32.1%), the survey was designed to minimally disrupt the ath-
letes. Moreover, the study was conducted during a period of an
intense doping debate in athletics, which may have led to some
athletes being reluctant to answer health/medical questionnaires.
Accordingly, the response rate can be regarded as acceptable.
Additional insights regarding the completion of this study are
addressed in a companion paper.35
What is already known on this topic?
▸ Specific interventions such as heat acclimatisation, pre-
cooling and adopting a hydration strategy allow for
optimising performance when competing in hot/humid
environmental conditions.
▸ Athletic events undertaken in the heat increase the risk of
exertional heat illness through the development of
hyperthermia and severe dehydration.
What are the new findings?
▸ Only 15% of athletes heat acclimatised ahead of the 2015
IAAF World Championships in which hot/humid conditions
were expected, ∼50% had a pre-cooling strategy, 96% a
fluid consumption strategy and over 89% a recovery
strategy.
▸ A previous diagnosis of exertional heat illness and the
female sex were associated with an increased likelihood of
using one or multiple heat stress prevention strategies.
How might it impact clinical practice in the near future?
▸ Information regarding heat acclimatisation as the primary
countermeasure to protect athlete health and optimise
performance should be provided to the athletes and their
support staff ahead of competitions to be held in hot/humid
conditions to allow for adequate preparation.
▸ Athletes previously experiencing heat illness symptoms and
those having been diagnosed with exertional heat illness are
more likely to consider heat acclimatisation prior to
competing under heat stress.
