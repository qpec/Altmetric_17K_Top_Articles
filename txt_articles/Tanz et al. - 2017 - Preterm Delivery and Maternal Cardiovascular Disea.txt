BACKGROUND: Preterm delivery has been shown to be associated with 
increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), but it is unknown whether this 
risk remains after adjustment for prepregnancy lifestyle and CVD risk factors.
METHODS: We examined the association between history of having 
delivered an infant preterm (<37 weeks) and CVD in 70 
182 parous women 
in the Nurses’ Health Study II. Multivariable Cox proportional-hazards 
models were used to estimate hazards ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) for CVD events (myocardial infarction and stroke, n=949); 
we also adjusted for intermediates to determine the proportion of the 
association between preterm and CVD accounted for by postpartum 
development of CVD risk factors.
RESULTS: After adjusting for age, race, parental education, and 
prepregnancy lifestyle and CVD risk factors, preterm delivery in the first 
pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of CVD (HR, 1.42; 95% 
CI, 1.16–1.72) in comparison with women with a term delivery (≥37 weeks) 
in the first pregnancy. When preterm delivery was split into moderate 
preterm (≥32 to <37 weeks) and very preterm (<32 weeks), the HRs were 
1.22 (95% CI, 0.96–1.54) and 2.01 (95% CI, 1.47–2.75), respectively. 
The increased rate of CVD in the very preterm group persisted even 
among women whose first pregnancy was not complicated by hypertensive 
disorders of pregnancy (HR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.38–2.93). In comparison with 
women with at least 2 pregnancies, all of which were delivered at term, 
women with a preterm first birth and at least 1 later preterm birth had a HR 
of CVD of 1.65 (95% CI, 1.20–2.28). The association between moderate 
preterm first birth and CVD was accounted for in part by the development 
of postpartum chronic hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, type 2 diabetes 
mellitus, and changes in body mass index (proportion accounted for, 
14.5%; 95% CI, 4.0–41.1), as was the very-preterm-CVD relationship 
(13.1%; 95% CI, 9.0–18.7).
CONCLUSIONS: Preterm delivery is independently predictive of CVD 
and may be useful for CVD prevention efforts. Because only a modest 
proportion of the preterm-CVD association was accounted for by 
development of conventional CVD risk factors, further research may 
identify additional pathways.

P
reterm delivery affects ≈10% of pregnancies in the 
United States each year.1 The 2011 effectiveness-
based guidelines released by the American Heart 
Association for the prevention of cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) in women included hypertensive disorders of preg-
nancy (HDP; preeclampsia and gestational hypertension) 
and gestational diabetes as risk factors for CVD.2 It has 
been hypothesized that pregnancy acts as a stress test 
that exposes subclinical CVD risk under the physiological 
stress of pregnancy; specifically, that pregnancy compli-
cations, including preterm delivery, as well as HDP and 
gestational diabetes, provide a warning sign of future 
CVD risk that could be useful in identifying high-risk wom-
en early in adult life before the appearance of clinical risk 
factors.3–5
CVD remains the leading cause of morbidity and mor-
tality in women.6 A growing body of literature indicates 
that women who deliver preterm are at 2-fold increased 
risk of future CVD events.7–14 However, it is unknown 
whether this risk persists after accounting for prepreg-
nancy lifestyle and CVD risk factors, because no studies 
examining this association have collected data on mul-
tiple lifestyle risk factors, including prepregnancy smok-
ing, physical activity, diet, body mass index (BMI), and 
family history of CVD, which could explain both a higher 
risk of preterm delivery and CVD. Furthermore, no study 
has examined the extent to which the increased risk is 
accounted for by the development of CVD risk factors 
after a preterm delivery.
We evaluated the association between preterm deliv-
ery and CVD (myocardial infarction [MI] or stroke) and 
whether this association is accounted for by postpartum 
development of traditional CVD risk factors (chronic hy-
pertension, hypercholesterolemia, type 2 diabetes mel-
litus [T2DM], and BMI).
METHODS
Population
The NHSII (Nurses’ Health Study II) is a longitudinal cohort of 
116 
429 US registered nurses aged 25 to 42 at baseline in 
1989. Participants were followed by using biennial question-
naires that collected data on diet, physical activity, smoking, 
medications, and reproductive history, and incident disease 
since the last questionnaire, as well. In 2001, a supplemental 
questionnaire containing a pregnancy history assessment that 
recorded gestation length, infant sex, and birthweight of each 
pregnancy lasting at least 12 weeks was mailed to 91 
297 
nurses. In 2009, a complete reproductive history questionnaire 
was mailed to all participants to capture information on preg-
nancies of all lengths, including gestation length, birthweight, 
and whether the pregnancy was complicated by preeclamp-
sia/toxemia, high blood pressure, or gestational diabetes. 
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of 
Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Return of the questionnaire 
was considered informed consent.
Gestation Length
Gestation length was assessed in categories on both the 2001 
and the 2009 questionnaires. In 2009, the primary source of 
our exposure data, participants were asked the length of each 
pregnancy in completed weeks within the following 9 catego-
ries: <8, 8 to 11, 12 to 19, 20 to 27, 28 to 31, 32 to 36, 37 
to 39, 40 to 42, and 43+ weeks. For women who did not com-
plete the 2009 reproductive wrap-up (n=10 
644), data from 
the 2001 supplemental questionnaire was used. The 2001 
questionnaire queried the length of each pregnancy lasting at 
least 12 weeks and collected information in the following 7 
categories: 12 to <20, 20 to <24, 24 to <28, 28 to <32, 32 
to <37, 37 to 42, and 43+ weeks. For our primary analyses, 
which used only the first pregnancy, gestation length catego-
ries were collapsed to create a dichotomous exposure variable 
(term, ≥37 weeks; preterm, <37 weeks) and a categorical 
exposure variable (term, ≥37 weeks; moderate preterm, ≥32 
to <37 weeks; very preterm, <32 weeks). In secondary analy-
ses, the entire pregnancy history was taken into account by 
using ever preterm as an exposure, and by classifying women 
on the basis of their first birth (term or preterm) and all later 
births (all term, at least 1 preterm, no future birth), as well, 
yielding 6 exposure categories. All analyses include only preg-
nancies that lasted at least 20 weeks.
We conducted a small validation study on a subset of 
NHSII participants who reported pregnancy-related high blood 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Prior studies show an association between preterm 
delivery and risk of maternal cardiovascular disease 
(CVD), but these lack control for pre- and postpreg-
nancy factors that may explain both a higher risk of 
preterm delivery and CVD.
• We report that women who deliver their first child 
preterm (<37 weeks) experience a 40% increased 
risk of CVD, whereas women with a very preterm 
first birth (<32 weeks) have double the risk, after 
adjustment for prepregnancy cardiometabolic risk 
factors.
• Less than 25% of this increased risk is explained by 
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, type 2 diabe-
tes mellitus, and changes in body mass index devel-
oping after the first birth.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Preterm delivery predicts CVD independent of tra-
ditional CVD risk factors in young and middle-aged 
women.
• This remains evident in pregnancies uncomplicated 
by preeclampsia and gestational hypertension.
• The American Heart Association has included pre-
eclampsia and gestational diabetes as CVD risk 
factors.
• Our results suggest preterm delivery should be 
added to this list.

pressure or toxemia/preeclampsia on the 1993 or 1995 bien-
nial questionnaires. We compared self-reported gestation 
length with gestation length from medical records for 403 par-
ticipants. For dichotomous preterm delivery (<37 weeks, ≥37 
weeks), with a prevalence of 31% in this sample, we found a 
sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 92%. When categorizing 
preterm delivery into very preterm, moderate preterm, and 
term, the Spearman correlation coefficient was 0.75, indicat-
ing good validity.
Cardiovascular End Point Assessment
On the 1989 baseline questionnaire, participants reported 
whether they ever had physician-diagnosed MI, angina, stroke 
(cerebrovascular accident), or transient ischemic attack. Any 
self-report of these conditions led to exclusion from the analy-
ses, because these prebaseline events were not confirmed. On 
each subsequent biennial questionnaire through 2013, partici-
pants were asked if they had experienced physician-diagnosed 
“myocardial infarction (heart attack)” or “stroke (CVA) or TIA” in 
the past 2 years. Permission was requested from participants 
or next of kin to obtain and review medical records following 
self-reported MI or stroke on any follow-up questionnaire. MI 
was confirmed by World Health Organization criteria of acute 
symptoms and diagnostic electrocardiographic changes or 
elevated cardiac enzyme levels.15 Stroke was classified by 
the National Survey of Stroke criteria, requiring atypical neu-
rological deficit of rapid or sudden onset lasting ≥24 hours or 
until death attributable to a vascular cause.16 Cerebrovascular 
pathology attributable to infection, trauma, or malignancy was 
excluded, as were silent strokes discovered only by radiologi-
cal imaging. Cases confirmed by medical record review were 
considered definite cases, whereas those acknowledged by 
the participant or relative as correct, but for which permission 
for medical record release was not provided or records could 
not be obtained, were considered probable. The end point for 
our primary analyses was definite or probable MI or stroke. 
Transient ischemic attack was not included in the outcome. 
Secondary analyses further included coronary revasculariza-
tion, which was self-reported on biennial questionnaires from 
1995 through 2013.
Covariates
Covariates were identified as potential confounders on the 
basis of a priori assumptions of their relationships with both 
preterm delivery and CVD. Family history and prepregnancy 
factors included as confounders were age at first birth and 
in 1989 (continuous), race/ethnicity (white, black, Latina, 
Asian, other), parental education (<9, 9–11, 12, 13–15, 16+ 
years), BMI (<18.5, 18.5 to <25, 25 to <30, ≥30 kg/m2), 
smoking (never, past, current), diet (quintiles that are based 
on the Alternative Healthy Eating Index-201017), alcohol use 
(none, ≤1 drink per week, 2–6 drinks per week, ≥1 drink per 
day), physical activity (never, 1–3, 4–6, 7–9, 10–12 months 
per year of strenuous physical activity), duration of oral contra-
ceptive use (none, <2, 2 to <4, ≥4 years), chronic hyperten-
sion, T2DM, hypercholesterolemia, and family history of MI or 
stroke. Prepregnancy factors were extracted from the biennial 
questionnaire immediately before the first pregnancy. Because 
the majority of first pregnancies (82%) occurred before the 
NHSII baseline in 1989, questions on the baseline (1989) and 
supplemental questionnaires that queried about behavior in 
high school and at varying ages from 13 through 42 were used 
to assign prepregnancy values for women whose first birth 
occurred before 1989. Prepregnancy covariate values were 
assigned using the information closest to, but preceding, a 
woman’s first delivery. For the small amount of missing data 
in our covariates, we used missing indicators. Prepregnancy 
lifestyle and cardiovascular risk factors were also evaluated as 
potential effect modifiers of the relationship between preterm 
delivery and CVD, whereas cardiovascular risk factors that 
developed after the first birth, including chronic hypertension, 
T2DM, hypercholesterolemia, changes in BMI, and breastfeed-
ing were assessed as intermediates. In sensitivity analyses, 
parity (1, 2, 3, or 4+ pregnancies), self-reported clinician-
diagnosed depression (yes/no), and pregnancy-related trauma 
(“ever experienced complications of a pregnancy or a labor 
and birth that you found traumatic”) were also investigated as 
possible intermediates.
Exclusions
For the primary analysis, we excluded women who did not 
complete either the 2001 or 2009 questionnaires document-
ing reproductive history (n=28 
945), were nulliparous in 2009 
(n=15 
556), were <18 (n=896) or >45 years of age (n=58) 
at first birth, or reported MI (n=288) or stroke (n=176) on the 
1989 baseline questionnaire, because these events were not 
confirmed. Women who had a confirmed MI or stroke before 
their first pregnancy were excluded (n=4), as were women with 
missing information on the gestation length (n=292) or year 
(n=32) of the first pregnancy, yielding 70 
182 women in our 
final analytic sample.
When we evaluated chronic hypertension, hypercholester-
olemia, T2DM, and BMI as intermediates, we also excluded 
women who had prepregnancy chronic hypertension (n=754), 
T2DM (n=185), or hypercholesterolemia (n=2147), because 
they were not able to develop these postpartum. Women who 
reported any of these risk factors on the baseline question-
naire in 1989, but did not provide a date of diagnosis were 
also excluded (n=1188), as were women who were missing 
BMI prepregnancy (n=3) or throughout all of follow-up (n=558). 
This yielded a sample of 65 
347 women.
Statistical Analysis
The characteristics of the study population were standardized 
to the age distribution of our population and summarized by 
preterm delivery status in the first pregnancy (Table 1).18 We 
used multivariable Cox proportional-hazards models to esti-
mate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 
the association between preterm delivery and CVD events (MI 
and stroke). Women entered the study at first birth and were 
followed until they experienced one of the censoring events: 
confirmed MI/stroke, death, their last returned questionnaire, 
or June 2013 (the end of our follow-up). Categorical preterm 
delivery in the first birth (term, moderate preterm, very pre-
term) was modeled using indicator variables, as was preterm 
delivery over multiple pregnancies.
To evaluate whether a woman’s entire pregnancy history 
with respect to preterm delivery was associated with CVD, we

created 6 categories on the basis of the first birth and all later 
births (eg, term-term, term-preterm, term-no later pregnancies, 
preterm-term, preterm-preterm, preterm-no later pregnancies). 
For this recurrence analysis and the analysis of ever preterm, 
follow-up began at 40 years of age when 97% of women had 
completed their reproductive careers. We excluded women 
who had births at ≥40 years of age (n=2491) and women with 
CVD events before 40 years of age (n=46).

Prepregnancy lifestyle risk factors were evaluated as effect 
modifiers by modeling multiplicative interaction terms between 
the factor of interest and preterm delivery. Likelihood ratio 
tests comparing the models with the interactions to models 
without the interactions provided a global test of effect modi-
fication by each prepregnancy factor. All potential effect modi-
fiers were modeled as indicator variables, with the exception 
of BMI, which was modeled continuously to increase power.
CVD risk factors that arose after pregnancy, including 
chronic hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, T2DM, breast-
feeding, and updated BMI, were evaluated as potential inter-
mediate outcomes by fitting Cox proportional-hazards models 
both with and without the intermediates.19 Chronic hyperten-
sion, hypercholesterolemia, and T2DM were treated individu-
ally as time-dependent intermediates. Once an intermediate 
outcome was developed, women were considered to have 
this risk factor for the remainder of follow-up. BMI and breast-
feeding were allowed to change multiple times over follow-up 
as women reported changes in their weight and cumulative 
breastfeeding on follow-up questionnaires. BMI was allowed 
to increase, decrease, or remain the same, whereas duration 
of breastfeeding could only increase over time. Before using 
the publicly available SAS %mediate macro,20,21 we tested 
the presence of interactions between each intermediate and 
preterm delivery by using likelihood ratio tests of nested 
models with and without the interactions,19 and observed no 
exposure-intermediate interactions (all P>0.25). To further 
ensure that the lack of interactions was not attributable to 
insufficient power, we assessed the magnitude of the HRs for 
preterm delivery and CVD within levels of each intermediate 
and confirmed that these exposure-intermediate interactions 
were not present (eg, HR of 1.51 and 1.39 in those with and 
without T2DM, respectively). When we split the preterm cate-
gory into moderate and very preterm, we found an interaction 
with T2DM (P=0.01). This observed interaction was based 
on a small number of cases in women with both moderate 
preterm and T2DM (5 cases) and very preterm and T2DM (13 
cases). We then calculated the proportion of the association 
between preterm delivery and CVD that was accounted for by 
chronic hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, T2DM, and BMI 
together and its 95% CI by using the publicly available SAS 
%mediate macro.20,21 All analyses were conducted using SAS 
9.4 (SAS Institute).
RESULTS
Table 1 summarizes characteristics of the participants 
by preterm delivery status in the first pregnancy: term 
(≥37 weeks), moderate preterm (≥32 to <37 weeks), or 
very preterm (<32 weeks). Nearly 9% of participants de-
livered preterm in their first pregnancy; 2.1% delivered 
very preterm, 6.7% delivered moderately preterm, and 
91.2% delivered at term. Baseline characteristics were 
largely similar across first pregnancy preterm delivery 
status, but women who delivered either moderately or 
very preterm were slightly more likely to have a BMI 
≥30 kg/m2, prepregnancy hypertension and hypercho-
lesterolemia, and a family history of CVD. Women who 
delivered very preterm in the first pregnancy were more 
likely to be current smokers, experience a stillbirth in 
first pregnancy, and have higher final parity.
We followed women for up to 50 years (median, 32; 
range, 2–50) for incident CVD. During 2 212 774 per-
son-years, we observed 949 CVD events (n=497 MIs, 
n=455 strokes, total n=952; 3 women experienced an 
MI and stroke at the same age), of which 584 were con-
sidered definite and 365 were probable. In comparison 
with those reporting a term first birth, women who had 
a preterm first birth had an increased rate of CVD (HR, 
1.54; 95% CI, 1.27–1.87; Table 2, model 1). This HR was 
slightly attenuated, but remained significant, after adjust-
ment for both prepregnancy lifestyle and CVD risk fac-
tors (1.42; 95% CI, 1.16–1.72, Table 2, model 3). When 
preterm delivery was split into 2 categories, the HRs for 
moderate preterm and very preterm were 1.22 (95% CI, 
0.96–1.54) and 2.01 (95% CI, 1.47–2.75), respectively, 
with a significant trend (P<0.0001) in the fully adjusted 
model (Table 2, model 3), indicating that preterm deliv-
ery remains predictive of CVD even after adjustment for 
multiple lifestyle and CVD risk factors present at the time 
of the delivery. Results did not change substantially when 
we also adjusted for prepregnancy miscarriage, when 
the outcome was expanded to include coronary revascu-
larization, or when multiple gestation pregnancies were 
excluded. When we evaluated the association between 
preterm delivery in first pregnancy and MI and stroke 
separately, the results were slightly stronger for MI than 
they were for stroke (online-only Data Supplement Table 
I). In addition, we investigated the association between 
ever having a preterm delivery and CVD and found re-
sults similar to those that considered only the first birth 
(online-only Data Supplement Table II).
We evaluated the association between very preterm 
in first pregnancy and CVD classified by live birth and 
stillbirth, because 47.8% of very preterm first pregnan-
cies resulted in stillbirth (Table 1). The increased rate of 
CVD persisted in both the very preterm live birth (HR, 
1.98; 95% CI, 1.27–3.08) and very preterm stillbirth 
(HR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.35–3.18) groups (online-only Data 
Supplement Table III).
Because HDP (preeclampsia and gestational hyper-
tension) have been shown to be associated with CVD,22–27 
and because HDP is an indication for preterm delivery,28 
we further investigated whether the association between 
preterm delivery and CVD was evident for pregnancies 
not complicated by HDP (Table 3). In comparison with a 
normotensive term first pregnancy, women with a nor-
motensive preterm first pregnancy had a 35% (HR, 1.35; 
95% CI, 1.06–1.72) increased rate of CVD, whereas 
those with both preterm delivery and HDP in the first 
pregnancy had a 66% increased rate (HR, 1.66; 95% CI, 
1.02–2.70). When the non-HDP preterm category was 
split into non-HDP moderate preterm and non-HDP very 
preterm, we observed no significantly higher rate in the 
normotensive moderate preterm group (HR, 1.12; 95%

2.93) increased rate in the normotensive very preterm 
group (Table 3, model 3). We did not separate the HDP

cause of insufficient power. Results were similar when 
we classified preterm by preeclampsia only, as opposed 
to HDP.
When comparing the 6 categories reflecting a wom-
an’s entire pregnancy history, all groups experienced a 
higher rate of CVD relative to women with >1 birth, all of

which were at term (Table 4). Women with a preterm first 
birth and at least 1 later preterm birth had the largest 
fully adjusted HR at 1.65 (95% CI, 1.20–2.28). Women 
who had only 1 child (either preterm or term) had an 
increased rate of CVD in comparison with women who 
had at least 2 children all of whom were term; moth-
ers with 1 preterm child (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 0.97–2.17) 
were at slightly higher risk than mothers with 1 term 
child (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.99–1.46). The results also 
suggest that, regardless of whether the preterm delivery 
occurred in the first pregnancy or a later one, the mother 
was at increased risk of CVD (Table 4).
We assessed whether the association between pre-
term delivery (term, moderate preterm, very preterm) in 
the first pregnancy and CVD was modified by prepreg-
nancy lifestyle and CVD risk factors. We found no effect 
modification by prepregnancy BMI, smoking, physical 
activity, alcohol, diet, duration of oral contraceptive use, 
T2DM, hypercholesterolemia, or miscarriage history (all 
P values of >0.10). Only chronic hypertension before 
first pregnancy appeared to be a modifier (P=0.02). The 
HRs comparing moderate preterm with term were 0.21 
(95% CI, 0.03–1.52) and 1.30 (95% CI, 1.02–1.64) in the 
women with and without prepregnancy chronic hyperten-
sion, respectively. The HR comparing very preterm with 
term among women with prepregnancy chronic hyper-
tension was 0.57 (95% CI, 0.08–4.14), whereas the HR 
was 2.12 (95% CI, 1.54–2.92) among women without 
prepregnancy chronic hypertension.
On the basis of comparisons of models evaluating as-
sociations between preterm delivery and CVD with and 
without postpartum risk factors, 12.8% (95% CI, 7.1–
21.9) of the association between preterm delivery and 
CVD was accounted for by the postpartum development 
of chronic hypertension, T2DM, hypercholesterolemia, 
or changes in BMI (Table 5, model 2a). The proportion 
accounted for increased to 15.9% (95% CI, 8.7–27.3) 
when breastfeeding was also included as an interme-
diate (Table 5, model 2b). When we split preterm into 
moderate and very preterm, 14.5% (95% CI, 4.0–41.1) 
of the association between moderate preterm delivery 
and CVD was accounted for by the development of 
chronic hypertension, T2DM, hypercholesterolemia, or 
changes in BMI, whereas 13.1% (95% CI, 9.0–18.7) of 
the very preterm-CVD association was accounted for by 
these risk factors (Table 5, model 2a). The inclusion of 
breastfeeding as an intermediate increased the propor-
tion to 20.7% (95% CI, 5.5–53.8) and 14.0% (95% CI, 
9.5–20.1) in the moderate and very preterm groups, 
respectively. Results were similar when parity, depres-
sion, and pregnancy-related trauma were included as 
intermediates.
A number of sensitivity analyses were performed. 
When we excluded probable cases of MI or stroke and 
considered only cases definitely confirmed using medical 
records by study physicians, we found a slightly stron-
ger association between preterm delivery and CVD (HR, 
1.50; 95% CI, 1.17–1.91) in our fully adjusted model.
As a sensitivity analysis, we also excluded all person-
time accrued between the first birth and the baseline 
questionnaire in 1989, because this time is, by defini-
tion, immortal.18 Participants had to survive without hav-
ing an MI or stroke until 1989 to be eligible for inclusion 
in our study, because the self-reported events before 
1989 were not validated and these women were exclud-
ed from our analytic sample. After excluding 558

DISCUSSION
Women who deliver a preterm infant are at a 40% in-
creased risk of future CVD events, whereas those who 
deliver before 32 weeks experience a doubling of CVD 
risk, even after accounting for prepregnancy sociodemo-
graphic, lifestyle, and CVD risk factors. This increased 
risk is only partially explained by the subsequent devel-
opment of traditional CVD risk factors such as chronic 
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, weight gain, and 
T2DM in the years after the delivery. The increased rate 
of CVD in women with very preterm deliveries was slight-
ly attenuated, but persisted when we considered preg-
nancies not complicated by preeclampsia or gestational 
hypertension. CVD risk factors, including chronic hyper-
tension, T2DM, hypercholesterolemia, and changes in 
BMI, that developed after the first birth accounted for 
<25% of the association between moderate or very pre-
term first birth and CVD. Because part of the association 
is through the development of traditional CVD risk fac-
tors postpartum, this suggests that the reduction of CVD 
risk factors in women who deliver a preterm infant might 
mitigate some of their elevated risk. A large portion of 
the increased rate, however, was not accounted for by 
the postpartum development of CVD risk factors and 
indicates the need to explore other pathways through 
which preterm delivery and CVD are linked. Because 
established risk factors will not fully capture this early 
indicator of CVD risk, preterm delivery may be a valuable 
additional risk marker in screening.
Other studies, largely without adjustment for prepreg-
nancy confounding factors, suggest a 1.2- to 2.5-fold 
increased risk of CVD in women with a history of pre-
term delivery, depending on the specific exposure and 
outcome definition.7–14 Our estimates of 1.42 in women 
who delivered preterm, and 1.22 and 2.01 in women 
in delivered moderately and very preterm, respectively,

are consistent with this range. We were able to improve 
on the current literature in 2 significant ways: by adjust-
ing for prepregnancy confounders and by estimating the 
proportion of the preterm-CVD association that is ac-
counted for by the emergence of CVD risk factors after 
the first birth. The current literature hails largely from 
administrative databases and registries, which preclude 
adjustment for prepregnancy lifestyle factors, such as 
diet, smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity, oral con-
traceptive use, and family history of CVD, because these 
are not available, leaving the possibility of unmeasured 
confounding. Only 1 study was able to adjust for pre-
pregnancy smoking,10 whereas 1 other study adjusted 
for prepregnancy BMI.12
Because of the nature of our longitudinal observa-
tional study, we collected information on a variety of 
lifestyle factors over each woman’s lifetime, allowing us 
to simultaneously account for these in our analyses. The 
inclusion of these variables as confounders in our mod-
els led to slight attenuations, the largest of which was in 
the association between very preterm delivery in the first 
pregnancy and CVD from a HR of 2.27 to 2.05. Prepreg-
nancy oral contraceptive use was primarily responsible 
for this attenuation. Because recent oral contraceptive 
use has been shown to be protective against preeclamp-
sia,29 an indication for preterm delivery (particularly very 
preterm),28,30 this attenuation is plausible. We were also 
able to evaluate whether the association between pre-
term delivery and CVD was modified by prepregnancy 
risk factors, which has not been explored in prior litera-
ture. Although we observed effect modification by pre-
pregnancy chronic hypertension, among women with 
prepregnancy chronic hypertension, the case numbers 
were small (n=1 case each in moderate and very pre-
term) and these findings should be replicated.
We also had the capacity to evaluate whether the 
preterm-CVD association persisted even in pregnancies 
not complicated by hypertensive disorders of pregnan-
cy. Two studies have previously investigated the risk of 
CVD associated with preterm delivery in a pregnancy 
not complicated by preeclampsia and found HRs rang-
ing from 1.18 to 2.95 depending on the degree of the 
preterm and the outcome definition.9,31 Our results simi-
larly show that preterm delivery remains associated with 
CVD even in pregnancies not complicated by HDP, sug-
gesting that women with preterm pregnancies alone may 
benefit from additional prevention and screening along 
with women who experience both preterm delivery and 
HDP. This is important because the majority (83%) of 
preterm pregnancies in our study were not complicated 
by HDP.
The longitudinal nature of our data allowed us to per-
form an analysis accounting for intermediate outcomes, 
which, to our knowledge, has not been previously done 
for the preterm-CVD association. We found that the asso-
ciation was partially accounted for by the development of 
chronic hypertension, T2DM, and hypercholesterolemia, 
and changes in BMI after pregnancy, but there remains a 
substantial portion that was not accounted for by these 
factors. These CVD risk factors may act as potential tar-
gets for primordial prevention in women with a history 
of preterm delivery. In addition, breastfeeding appeared 
to account for part of this association on top of tradi-
tional CVD risk factors; whether breastfeeding itself can 
mitigate the risk associated with preterm delivery or is 
a marker for other risk factors cannot be established by 
these observational data. Prior observational research 
has shown that longer duration of lactation is associ-
ated with a reduced risk of MI,32 T2DM,33 and chronic 
hypertension.34 Further research is needed to identify 
other factors or pathways that may be responsible for 
the increased risk of CVD in these women.
In addition to the development of CVD risk factors 
emerging after a preterm delivery, we also hypothesize 
that preterm delivery and CVD are linked through sub-
clinical shared risk factors that predate both preterm 
delivery and CVD. The causes of preterm delivery gener-
ally depend on whether the premature delivery was spon-
taneous or medically indicated.30 Spontaneous preterm 
deliveries typically result from intrauterine infection or 
inflammation, uteroplacental ischemia or hemorrhage, 
uterine overdistension, stress, or vascular disease,30,35,36 
whereas medically indicated preterm deliveries are often 
caused by preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, 
or other maternal factors including obesity and chronic 
hypertension.30 Intrauterine infection, which triggers the 
release of inflammatory chemokines and cytokines,30,35 
has been shown to cause ≈30% of all preterm deliver-
ies.30 Inflammatory processes also contribute to the 
development of atherosclerosis, plaque rupture, and, ul-
timately, CVD.37 Inflammation, along with prepregnancy 
subclinical vascular disease and obesity, may underlie 
both preterm delivery and CVD. In support of this hy-
pothesis, high C-reactive protein levels in pregnancy, a 
marker of inflammation, are associated with spontane-
ous preterm delivery,38–40 and C-reactive protein is also a 
strong predictor of CVD risk.41
The primary limitation of our study is the potential for 
exposure misclassification because participants self-
reported gestation length between 0 and 47 years after 
their first pregnancy (median=27). Prior studies of ma-
ternal recall of preterm delivery suggest high specificity 
(86%–100%), but lower sensitivity (33%–72%).42–49 Our 
validation study showed higher sensitivity (81%) and 
specificity (92%), indicating good validity. Because our 
validation study included only women who reported pre-
eclampsia, it is unclear whether we would see similar 
results in the entire analytic sample. Because the ex-
posure is nondifferentially misclassified with respect to 
the outcome, our results may be biased toward the null. 
There is also the possibility of unmeasured and residual 
confounding. However, we were able to adjust for mul-

tiple prepregnancy cardiometabolic risk factors, which 
has not previously been done. The adjustment for these 
additional and well-documented shared risk factors, in-
cluding diet, physical activity, BMI, smoking, alcohol, 
oral contraceptive use, and family history did not largely 
attenuate the results; thus it is unlikely that unmeasured 
or residual confounding would be large enough to alter 
the conclusions from our study. We were also unable to 
perform formal mediation analysis because there is cur-
rently no analytic method established to handle multiple, 
correlated, time-dependent mediators in the context of 
censored survival outcomes. However, our ability to ac-
count for intermediate outcomes that arise after the first 
birth has not previously been done for CVD-related out-
comes and provides some insight as to how preterm 
delivery and CVD are linked. In addition, we may have un-
derestimated the proportion of the association explained 
by the intermediates because blood pressure and lipid 
levels are continuous, and we were only able to include 
binary indicators for clinical conditions related to these 
measures. We were unable to explore the associations 
between spontaneous and induced preterm delivery, 
preterm labor, or premature rupture of membranes and 
CVD. Our study also potentially suffers from immortal 
time bias, because women could not have a CVD event 
before the 1989 baseline questionnaire to be included 
in our analytic sample. However, excluding the immortal 
person-time had no impact on our results, likely because 
of the limited number of CVD events that would occur 
before baseline in a young, healthy population that was 
between 25 and 42 years old in 1989. Last, our cohort 
is primarily white (93%), limiting generalizability. Non-His-
panic black women have a higher prevalence of preterm 
delivery in comparison with both non-Hispanic white and 
Hispanic women, and the proportion of preterm deliver-
ies that are moderate and very preterm differ by race.1 
The mix of causes of preterm delivery may vary between 
race/ethnicity groups and may be changing over time, in 
particular, as prepregnancy BMI rises,50 suggesting that 
there may be differences in how predictive preterm de-
livery is of future CVD in other racial and ethnic groups.
Our study has several strengths. We were able to 
adjust for multiple prepregnancy lifestyle risk factors 
for CVD, yielding better confounding control than prior 
studies on preterm delivery and CVD. Similarly, unlike 
registry-based studies, we had longitudinal data on the 
development of traditional CVD risk factors, including 
chronic hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, T2DM, 
and changes in BMI over time, allowing us to evaluate 
whether the association between preterm delivery and 
CVD was accounted for by these factors. On top of the 
rich data on confounders and mediators, we also had 
information on the complete reproductive history of our 
women, enabling us to investigate, not only the associa-
tion between first pregnancy and CVD, but also recurrent 
preterm deliveries. Last, to our knowledge, this is the 
longest study on preterm delivery and CVD with follow-up 
ranging from 2 to 50 years (median=32).
In conclusion, preterm delivery is independently pre-
dictive of CVD, even after adjustment for multiple cardio-
metabolic risk factors, and the association is mediated 
only in part by the postpartum development of traditional 
CVD risk factors. We need further research to determine 
the incidence and timing of the development of these risk 
factors and establish the most effective screening and 
prevention protocols for women with a history of preterm 
delivery. We also need additional research on alternative, 
novel pathways through which preterm and CVD may be 
associated and which could also inform prevention meth-
ods. Ultimately, preterm delivery may be a useful prognos-
tic tool to identify high-risk women early in life who would 
benefit from early screening, prevention, and treatment.
