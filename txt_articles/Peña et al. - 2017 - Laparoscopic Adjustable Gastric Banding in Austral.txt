Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Banding in Australian adolescents: 
Should it be done? 
Abstract 
Objective: There are very few studies on laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) in 
obese adolescents with follow up for more than 36 months, let alone good prospective data 
beyond 24 months in Australian adolescents. We aimed to evaluate medium term (>36 months) 
safety and efficacy of LAGB in adolescents with severe obesity. 
Methods: Prospective cohort study (March 2009–December 2015) in one tertiary referral 
hospital including obese adolescents (14-18 years) with a body mass index (BMI) >40 (or ≥35 
with comorbidities) who consented to have LAGB. Exclusion criteria were syndromal causes 
of obesity, depression and oesophageal motility disorders.  Main outcome measures include 
change in weight and BMI at 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months post LAGB. Postoperative 
complications and admissions. 
Results: 21 adolescents (median [Interquartile range (IQR)] 17.4 [16.5-17.7] years, 9 males, 
mean ± SD BMI 47.3 ± 8.4 kg/m2) had a median follow up of 45.5 [32-50] months post LAGB. 
Follow up data were available for 16 adolescents. Weight and BMI improved significantly at 
all follow up times (all p <0.01). The median maximum BMI loss was 10 [7.1-14.7] kg/m2. 
There were 4 minor early complications. Seven bands were removed due to weight loss 
failure/regain (2 had also obstructive symptoms).  
Conclusions: We have shown in the longest prospective LAGB postoperative follow up study 
of Australian adolescents, that LAGB improves BMI in the majority of adolescents without 
significant comorbidities. LAGB is still a reasonable option to be considered as a temporary 
procedure to manage severe obesity during adolescence.

Introduction 
The obesity epidemic is a global phenomenon [1].  In Australia 25% of children aged 6 to18 
years have been identified as either overweight or obese and around 5% as obese [2]. Childhood 
obesity is linked to serious physical, psychologic and social comorbidities, and may result in 
reduced life expectancy due to early onset of disorders such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, 
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, obstructive sleep apnoea, depression accompanied by anxiety 
and low self-esteem. These comorbidities are becoming more prevalent in adolescents and 
young adults [3,4].  
A multidisciplinary approach underpins obesity treatment and can result in improvement in 
weight and comorbidities. This approach includes lifestyle interventions such as dietary 
modification, increased physical activity, reduced sedentary activity, behaviour modification, 
family therapy and targeted medications [5,6]. Meta-analyses have shown that non-
pharmacological and pharmacological management strategies evaluated in adolescents over a 
period of 6 to 12 months are only mildly effective in reducing body mass index (BMI) [5]. For 
example behavioural interventions reduce BMI by 3 kg/m2 [5] and metformin reduces BMI by 
1 kg/m2 [7]. As opposed to these therapies it has become apparent that bariatric surgery is the 
most effective treatment for obese adults [8] and recent studies including a meta-analysis 
indicate similar benefits can be expected in adolescents in the short term [9–14]. According to 
Australian and New Zealand recommendations and revised National Health and Medical 
Research Council guidelines for obesity management laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding 
(LAGB) should be considered in post-pubertal adolescents with a BMI > 40 kg/m2 or BMI ≥ 
35 kg/m2 with obesity-related comorbidities [6,15].  
A recent meta-analysis of bariatric surgical procedures including mostly short term follow up 
studies in 538 adolescents undergoing LAGB reported a BMI loss of 11 kg/m2, improvement 
 3 
of comorbidities, no deaths and minor complications [12]. Medium to long-term studies (more 
than 36 months post-surgery) regarding the efficacy of LAGB in adolescents are scarce [16] 
and there is no prospective data beyond 24 months in Australian adolescents [13,17,18]. 
Therefore, we aimed to evaluate longitudinally safety and medium term effects of LAGB in 
severely obese adolescents in the South Australian Health Service.  
Materials and Methods 
Design and Subjects  
This prospective single centre observational study (March 2009–December 2015) was 
designed to determine the efficacy and safety of LAGB in adolescents. The study was approved 
by the Hospital Research Ethics Committee (HREC 2168/5/15). Written informed consent was 
obtained from all parents of participants and written assent from all participants. 
Adolescents who were referred by paediatricians for LAGB assessment to a single Paediatric 
Surgeon from March 2009 until May 2013 were recruited consecutively after they were 
considered eligible for LAGB. Inclusion criteria for LAGB were age 14 to 18 years with a BMI 
40 or 35 with co-morbidities, Tanner pubertal development stage 4, and documented failure of 
medical management over 6 months. Inclusion criteria for the study were consent for the LAGB 
procedure as well as physiological oesophageal and gastric studies prior to LAGB and 6 months 
post LAGB (Data on these studies were not included in this manuscript). Exclusion criteria for 
the study were syndromal causes of obesity, depression and oesophageal motility disorders.   
All adolescents received preoperative multidisciplinary evaluation from a paediatrician, 
paediatric surgeon, dietitian and psychologist, and were advised to consider LAGB as an 
interim measure. Preoperative psychological evaluation included two reviews to screen for 
 4 
 
depression, underlying motivation and to ensure there was adequate comprehension of LAGB 
procedure.  
Surgical Technique 
All procedures were performed laparoscopically by a single paediatric surgeon mentored by 2 
experienced bariatric surgeons. All adolescents were operated on after 4 weeks of exclusive 
preoperative very low calorie diet (Optifast® VLCD™, Nestlé, Switzerland).  The pars flaccida 
technique with the insertion of the Swedish Adjustable Gastric Band (SAGB-VC, Ethicon INC, 
Somerville, USA) was used in all adolescents. Two to three anterior gastro-gastric serosa-to-
serosa sutures using non-absorbable Ethibond Excel® 2-0 (Ethicon INC, Somerville, USA) 
secured the band. The band was left empty without volume adjustment for at least 6 weeks 
postoperatively.  
Postoperative Management 
The postoperative follow up protocol included monthly follow up for the first 6 months and 
then follow up was based on clinical progress with a review at least once a year. Missed visits 
did not necessary indicate withdrawal from the study as adolescents returned for later visits 
even after missing a previous visit. Subjects were not followed up after the gastric band was 
removed. Postoperative reviews by paediatric surgeon and dietitian included evaluation of food 
selection, weight, subjective assessment of band restriction, band fluid adjustments and 
postoperative complications. Band adjustments were driven primarily by clinical assessments 
of food intake restriction as reported by adolescents and the presence or absence of obstructive 
and/or reflux symptoms. Amount of weight loss was not taken into consideration for band 
adjustments. There was a relatively low threshold for consideration of band removal in keeping 
with the preoperative advice. Transition to adult care was organised after a minimum of 3 years 
of follow up by a single paediatric surgeon. 
 
 5 
Outcome measures 
Outcome measures included changes in weight and BMI, development of early (< 30 days) and 
late (> 30 days) postoperative complications which were classified according to the Clavien - 
Dindo classification, [19] and presence of comorbidities. All admissions to hospital were 
documented over the follow up period.  
Weight was measured in light clothing using Wedderburn digital scales (Wedderburn, Sydney, 
Australia) at baseline, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months post LAGB. Baseline measurements were 
defined as measurements obtained prior to Optifast. Height was measured on a wall stadiometer 
to the nearest 0.1 cm. BMI Z score was calculated using EpiInfo database version 3.5.1 
(www.ncdc.gov/epiinfo). Maximum BMI loss was defined as the maximum BMI loss at any 
time point during the follow up. Health-related quality of life was assessed at baseline and 6 
month post LAGB using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL TM 4.0 MAPI, 
Research Institute, Lyon, France). Adolescents completed the Child Self-Report for ages 13 to 
18 years and their parents completed Parent Proxy-Report for ages 13 to 18 years. The PedsQL 
consists of 23 items describing physical, emotional, social and school performance aspects 
from which a total score is derived. Comorbidities evaluated pre and postoperative included 
presence of Type 2 diabetes using HbA1c and/or oral glucose tolerance test as diagnostic 
criteria, abnormal liver function defined as alanine transaminase (ALT) above the reference 
range; and at least one abnormality in fasting lipid profile including triglycerides, total 
cholesterol and/or LDL cholesterol above the reference range and HDL cholesterol below the 
reference range. 
Statistics 
Categorical data were summarized with the use of frequency of distributions. Continuous data 
were summarized as mean ± SD or median (interquartile range [IQR)]) according to normality. 
Comparison of weight and BMI changes was performed using the paired-samples Student’s t-
 6 
 
test. Statistical analyses were performed using MedCalc for Windows, version 12.5 (MedCalc 
Software, Ostend, Belgium).  
 
Results 
 
Twenty nine adolescents were referred for assessment of LAGB in the South Australian Health 
Service. Eight adolescents did not participate in the study (7 did not have LAGB after surgical 
evaluation and 1 did not consent to be part of the study). 21 adolescents (9 males, 20 Caucasians 
and 1 Asian) with a median age of 17.3 (minimum 14.2 and maximum 18.2) years, a median 
[IQR] BMI of 47.1 [39.9-52.5] and a median [IQR] BMI z score of 2.7 [2.4-3.0] underwent 
LAGB between March 2009 and May 2013. 16/21 adolescents had a BMI over 40 kg/m2. 
Preoperative comorbidities included: Pre-diabetes (n=2), high ALT (n=10), abnormal lipid 
profile (n=10), use of atorvastatin (n=1), use of continuous positive airway pressure for 
obstructive sleep apnoea (n=1) and hypertension on antihypertensive medication (n=1). None 
were taking antidepressants. The mean length of stay in hospital after LAGB was 2.8±0.6 days. 
Nine out of 21 adolescents improved in at least one comorbidity after LAGB. Two adolescents 
had resolution of their pre diabetes with normal glucose tolerance test and HbA1c below 5.7% 
post LAGB. ALT improved significantly after LAGB (Pre LAGB Median [IQR] of 39 [33.1-
68.9] U/L vs post LAGB Median [IQR] 21.5 [20.4-38.7] U/L, p=0.02). Mean ± SD overall 
quality of life scores improved significantly after 6 months as reported by both adolescents 
(60±20.5 vs 74.9±16.3, p=0.03) and parents (52.8±22.9 vs 74±16.3, p=0.02).  
Complete follow up data for weight over the study period was available for 16/21 adolescents 
(76%). Three adolescents did not come back post LAGB (2 after 12 months, 1 after 18 months), 
but phone contact with families and new treating private adult bariatric surgeon confirmed their 
 7 
bands were still in situ. Two adolescents who missed the 48 months follow up visit came at 60 
months. 
Weight and BMI loss changes  
Pre and postoperative BMI for each individual during the study period is included in Table 1. 
Median [IQR] BMI at last follow up was 39.2 [31.7-50.3] kg/m2 after a median follow up 45.5 
[32-50] months. Median [IQR] post LAGB maximum BMI loss was 10 [7.0-14.6] kg/m2 after 
a median follow up of 13 [6- 41.2] months. Weight and BMI changes over time including 
number of available/eligible adolescents at every time point are included in Table 2. BMI post 
LAGB at all time follow up visits (3, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months) improved significantly 
compared to BMI pre LAGB (all p<0.01). 
Early and late postoperative complications  
There were 4 early minor and 11 late band or weight loss related complications (Table 3). 
Seven adolescents had their band removed after 3.5±1.0 years. Two bands were removed due 
to weight loss failure and 5 due to weight regain. Two adolescents had also obstructive 
symptoms combined with weight regain. Our reoperation rate including band removals was 
42%. Two adolescents developed symptomatic gall stone disease (one of which had a 
laparoscopic cholecystectomy 14 months after LAGB and the other endoscopic retrograde 
cholangiopancreatography and sphincterotomy 60 months after LAGB, [cholescystectomy was 
not required]). There were no skin removal procedures during follow up. There were no life 
threatening postoperative complications during the early and late postoperative follow up and 
there were no slippages, band erosions or pouch dilatations (Table 3). None of the adolescents 
had another bariatric surgical procedure and none of the females had an unplanned pregnancy. 
There were 12 admissions to hospital related to band removals (n=7), gallstones (n=2), early 
postoperative fever and vomiting (1), early wound infection (n=1), and early postoperative 
epigastric pain (n=1).

Conclusion  
 
This is the first prospective Australian study reporting on safety and medium term outcomes 
of obese adolescents who have undergone LAGB in a public health service. We have shown 
that the use of LAGB in severely obese adolescents reduced BMI by 10 kg/m2 over 45 months. 
This degree of BMI loss is comparable to previous studies and meta-analyses [9,12,16] even 
though short term BMI loss in our cohort was lower than previously reported in Australian 
adolescents participating in a randomized controlled trial over 24 months [13]. In spite of a 
lower reduction of BMI in comparison to other bariatric surgery procedures used in adolescents 
such as laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 
[LRYGB] (12), adolescents had improvement of quality of life and comorbidities without 
significant morbidity with LAGB. 
There were no major operative complications in our cohort. Life threatening surgical 
complications after LAGB in adolescents are uncommon with no reported deaths [12]. The rate 
of major complications after LAGB such as bleeding and conversion to laparotomy is 0.8% 
compared to 0.7% after LSG and 5.1% after LRYGB [12]. Even though the incidence of major  
complications such as staple leaks after LSG is low, it is of much greater significance and can 
cause severe morbidity [11,12]. There were few minor perioperative complications in our study 
consistent with studies of bariatric surgery in adults and adolescents that showed lower minor 
perioperative complications after LAGB in comparison to LSG and LRYGB [1% compared to 
2.4% and 2.5%, respectively] [12,20]. 
There was a higher band removal rate in our cohort compared with the few studies that have 
reported on the morbidity of LAGB beyond 3 years in adolescents (16). In contrast, an earlier 
study from Austria including 50 adolescents reported lower band removal rate over a similar 
period of follow up [16]. The higher band removal rate in our study was most likely related to 
 9 
 
an aggressive practice to remove bands in case of weight loss failure/ regain with or without 
band intolerance symptoms. Our band removal rate is consistent with adult studies. Reasons 
for band removal after LAGB in adults are weight loss failure, intolerable obstructive 
symptoms or band related complications such as erosion, slippage or pouch dilatation [21]. 
There were no band related complications such as erosion, slippage or pouch dilatation in our 
cohort.  
In addition to band removal, one late morbidity leading to reoperation in our cohort was related 
to symptomatic gall stone formation which is known to be related to weight loss and has been 
previously described in adults and adolescents [13,22,23].  
Our reoperation rate of 42% in the medium term follow up was not related to any severe and 
life threatening complications. In contrast, there are more serious complications that can occur 
with LSG and LRYGB. Furthermore there have been no reported deaths in adolescents post 
LAGB and there is less need for multivitamin supplementation post LAGB compared to other 
procedures such as LSG or LRYGB at a developmental stage when adherence to medications 
is suboptimal.  
The strengths of the current study include the prospective single centre enrolment with a single 
paediatric bariatric surgeon and a standardized reporting method on all events post LAGB over 
a median period of 45 months. In addition, cohort maintenance was reasonable. Limitations of 
the study included limited data on other comorbidities such as obstructive sleep apnoea, 
however availability of sleep studies is limited as routine investigations for these children 
especially if they did not have symptoms. Another limitation of this study was the small sample 
size. However, long-term (beyond 36 months) results of LAGB in adolescents remain scarce 
[16]. In addition one of the largest prospective bariatric surgery studies in the U.S. (Teens LAB 
consortium) has provided 36 month follow up of only 11 adolescents post LAGB [22]. 
 10 
Even though LAGB is currently the least used bariatric surgical procedure in adults and in 
adolescents in the USA (8,10, 22), it is less invasive, it is reversible and has a lower rate of life 
threatening complications. The results of this study support the role of LAGB as a temporary 
management option to manage severe obesity during adolescence. After removal, conversion 
to more invasive bariatric procedures such as LSG or LRYGB is possible. 
In conclusion, we have shown in the longest prospective post LAGB study in Australian 
adolescents with severe obesity, that LAGB improves BMI in the majority of adolescents with 
minimal complications.  LAGB may be the preferred ‘initial’ operation for adolescents with 
severe obesity as part of a ‘stepped up’ surgical management plan.
