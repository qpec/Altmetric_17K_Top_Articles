Adoptive transfer of tumor-specific T cells has been shown to elicit 
tumor regression in patients with leukemia or melanoma, with some 
patients experiencing durable complete responses1–3. Adjuvant treat-
ments that are aimed at increasing the fraction of responders and 
extending ACT to other solid tumors are thus under intensive study4. 
The administration of supporting cytokines (such as interleukins) 
or tumor-microenvironment-modulating factors are two central 
approaches that have been explored in preclinical and clinical stud-
ies to enhance T cell therapy5,6. However, supplying adjuvant drugs at 
the right time and site appears crucial, as systemically administered 
immunomodulators can have toxic effects7,8. Genetic engineering of 
T cells to express adjuvant cytokines in response to T cell receptor 
(TCR)-regulated transcription factors has been pursued in an attempt 
to focus cytokine delivery in the tumor microenvironment, but these 
approaches to date have still shown substantial toxicity in patients, 
which is thought to be due, in part, to wide variation in T cell gene 
expression among individuals9.
In previous work, we described a complementary chemistry-based 
approach to delivering adjuvant drugs during adoptive therapy via 
conjugation of drug-loaded lipid nanoparticles (which we referred 
to as ‘backpacks’) to the plasma membrane of ACT T cells10–12. 
Nanoparticles that were covalently coupled to cell surface proteins were 
not internalized, and they allowed for potent autocrine stimulation of 
transferred T cells, leading to enhanced T cell persistence and function 
in vivo11. However, two important limitations of this approach were (i) 
the low drug-loading capacity achievable with traditional encapsula-
tion strategies for protein drugs in nanoparticles and (ii) the lack of 
regulation of drug release, which was mediated by spontaneous slow 
leakage of drug cargos from the nanoparticle backpacks.
Here we demonstrate an approach to address these challenges and 
describe a strategy that chemically links adjuvant drug delivery to 
T cell activation by using TCR-signaling-responsive nanoparticle 
backpacks. Using a human interleukin (IL)-15 super-agonist (IL-
15Sa) as a testbed drug cargo, we found that T cells backpacked with 
TCR-responsive NGs expanded 16-fold more in tumors than T cells 
supported by systemic cytokine injections, while remaining largely 
quiescent in the peripheral blood. This regulated drug release allowed 
eightfold more IL-15Sa to be administered safely in mice as compared 
to that with the free cytokine, enabling substantially improved thera-
peutic efficacy.

Design of protein nanogels responsive to changes in cell 
surface redox activity
Mammalian cells actively perform oxidation and reduction reac-
tions in the face of the extracellular oxidizing environment through 
a family of transmembrane oxidoreductase enzymes13. Motivated 
by the fact that activated T cells have elevated levels of cell-surface 
enhancing t cell therapy through tcr-signaling-

Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with antigen-specific T cells has shown remarkable clinical success; however, approaches to safely 
and effectively augment T cell function, especially in solid tumors, remain of great interest. Here we describe a strategy to 
‘backpack’ large quantities of supporting protein drugs on T cells by using protein nanogels (NGs) that selectively release these 
cargos in response to T cell receptor activation. We designed cell surface–conjugated NGs that responded to an increase in T cell 
surface reduction potential after antigen recognition and limited drug release to sites of antigen encounter, such as the tumor 
microenvironment. By using NGs that carried an interleukin-15 super-agonist complex, we demonstrated that, relative to systemic 
administration of free cytokines, NG delivery selectively expanded T cells 16-fold in tumors and allowed at least eightfold higher 
doses of cytokine to be administered without toxicity. The improved therapeutic window enabled substantially increased tumor 
clearance by mouse T cell and human chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy in vivo.

free thiols relative to those in naive cells (Supplementary Fig. 1a)14, 
we measured the cell surface reduction activity of naive or activated 
T cells by using WST-1, a membrane-impermeable compound that 
forms a colored product following reduction15,16. Primed CD8+  
T cells showed higher cell surface reduction rates than naive T cells 
 
(Fig. 1a). However, T cell surface redox activity further increased 
following stimulation with antigen-presenting cells or with anti-
CD3– and anti-CD28–coated beads (hereafter referred to as ‘anti-
CD3/CD28 beads’) (Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Fig. 1b).
We reasoned that increased redox activity at the T cell surface could 
be exploited to obtain antigen-triggered adjuvant protein release by 
using reduction-responsive nanoparticles that were bound to the 
plasma membrane of T cells (Fig. 1c). To this end we generated a 
‘carrier-free’ protein backpack (Fig. 1d): We synthesized a disulphide-
containing bis-N-hydroxy succinimide (NHS) cross-linker (NHS-SS-
NHS) and identified conditions in which the solution-phase reaction 
of cross-linker and cargo proteins led to the formation of NGs com-
prised of many copies of the protein that were cross-linked to itself. 
NG formation typically required a large molar excess of cross-linker 
to protein (for example, 15:1 cross-linker:protein; Supplementary 
 
Fig. 2a). NGs formed from several proteins, including cytokines 
and antibodies, contained a high mass fraction of protein cargo 
(~92% of dry weight) with a high incorporation efficiency (>90%, 
Supplementary Table 1), were relatively homogeneous (~80–130 nm 
mean hydrodynamic diameters) (Fig. 1e,f) and had slightly negative 
zeta potentials (Supplementary Table 2). The disulphide cross-linker 
was designed to be cleaved in response to reducing conditions at the T 
cell surface, followed by release of un-adducted protein cargo through 
a self-immolative reaction (Fig. 1d)17–19. For promising therapeutic 
cargos, we focused our efforts on IL-2Fc (a fusion protein between IL-
2 and an antibody Fc fragment) and ALT-803, a human IL-15 super-
agonist complex (IL-15Sa) that is presently in clinical trials against 
hematological malignancies and solid tumors5,20,21. Consistent with 
expectations, reducing agents, such as glutathione (GSH), accelerated 
the release of IL-15Sa from NGs in a manner dependent on the NG 
cleavable disulphide (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Fig. 2b). Cytokine 
released from the NGs exhibited the expected molecular weight and 
had bioactivity indistinguishable from that of unmodified IL-15Sa 
(Fig. 1h and Supplementary Fig. 2c), suggesting that there was release 
of intact cytokine without extensive residual chemical groups.
CD45 maintains nanogels at the cell surface
To sustain stimulation, NG backpacks must not be internalized by the 
carrier cell. We initially attempted to link NGs to T cells through the 
incorporation of maleimide- or NHS-activated cross-linkers into the 
NG structure, for covalent coupling to free thiols or amines on cell 
surface proteins (Supplementary Fig. 3). This approach, which was 
previously successful for the attachment of lipid nanocarriers with 
encapsulated drug cargos, led to rapid internalization of the IL-2Fc 
or IL-15Sa NGs (Fig. 2a). Endocytosis was not observed with control 
NGs that were formed with albumin (Fig. 2a), suggesting that inter-
nalization was a result of cell surface cytokine receptor binding to the 
cytokine-NG even before protein was released and the triggering of 
natural internalization pathways for these cytokines22.
To increase the cell surface half-life of the NGs, we used mono-
clonal-antibody-functionalized liposomes to screen for slowly inter-
nalizing T cell surface proteins that could be used as specific anchors 
for the NGs. We tested targeting to CD2, CD8, CD11α, CD90 and 
CD45, candidate receptors we had previously identified in a mass 
spectrometry analysis of proteins that stably anchored lipid nanocap-
sules to T cells using maleimide chemistry12. We incubated T cells 
with antibody- and biotin-functionalized liposomes and measured the 
fraction of surface-accessible vesicles over time. Liposomes that were 
targeted to most of these receptors showed substantial internalization 
within a few days, with the exception of those that targeted CD45, 
which exhibited prolonged cell surface retention (Fig. 2b). Free anti-
CD45 also exhibited a long cell surface half-life when bound in excess 
to T cells (Supplementary Fig. 4a). IL-2Fc-conjugated liposomes, 
which exhibited rapid internalization, could be stably retained on 
the cell surface if they were additionally functionalized with a small 
quantity of anti-CD45 (Fig. 2c,d). Cross-linking of CD45 via anti-
CD45-bearing particles did not inhibit T cell proliferation in response 
to anti-CD3/CD28 beads (Supplementary Fig. 4b), suggesting that 
CD45 binding did not inhibit TCR signaling.
Guided by these findings, we incorporated a small quantity of 
anti-CD45 into the NGs (10 mol % relative to the IL-15Sa payload) 
to provide noncovalent attachment of the NGs to cells (Fig. 2e). 
 
We also adsorbed a small quantity of poly(ethylene glycol)-b-
poly(L-lysine) (PEG-PLL) to the NGs immediately following the 
synthesis reaction. Covalent coupling of a portion of PEG-PLL to 
residual cross-linker NHS groups at the particle surfaces provided 
a uniform positive zeta potential to the particles and promoted 
initial electrostatic association between the particle and plasma 
membrane (Fig. 2e), maximizing the efficiency and total amount 
of NG loading per cell (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). With this 
approach, T cells could be homogeneously loaded with a desired 
dose of cytokine-NGs, up to ~8 µg IL-15Sa per 106 T cells (Fig. 2f  
and Supplementary Table 3). Cytokine-NGs containing anti-CD45 
were retained on the surfaces of unstimulated T cells for at least 
 
7 d (Fig. 2g,h). An analogous approach using anti-human-CD45- 
specific antibodies (anti-hCD45) led to similar cell surface retention 
of NGs on human CD8+ T cells (Supplementary Fig. 5). Anti-CD45/
protein-NGs coupled to primed T cells released protein much faster 
when the cells were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 beads or pep-
tide-pulsed dendritic cells (Fig. 2i,j and Supplementary Fig. 6a,b). 
 
Finally, because a portion of activated effector T cells might be 
expected to undergo apoptosis in vivo as part of their normal fate, we 
tested whether cell death would cause acute release of NG payloads 
that might lead to toxicity. As shown in Supplementary Figure 6c,d, 
induction of apoptotic cell death in backpacked T cells using anti-
CD95 led to no loss of NGs over several hours, suggesting there were 
no dramatic changes in cell-bound NGs on dying cells.
Cytokine NGs promote enhanced T cell expansion in vitro
T cells that were backpacked with anti-CD45- and IL-15Sa-containing 
NGs (hereafter referred to as ‘aCD45/IL-15Sa-NGs’) and stimulated 
with anti-CD3/CD28 beads expanded ~100-fold in 5 d, a substantial 
increase relative to T cells that had been pulsed with the same total 
amount of free IL-15Sa for 1 h and then washed out. There were also 
more backpacked T cells than cells that had been cultured continu-
ously with IL-15Sa, suggesting that cell surface localization of the NGs 
enhanced receptor engagement (Fig. 3a,b). NGs that were linked to 
T cells covalently rather than via anti-CD45 (which we refer to as ‘IL-
15Sa-NGs’) and NGs that were formed with a non-degradable cross-
linker (hereafter referred to as ‘aCD45/IL-15Sa-NGs (non-deg.)’) 
stimulated weaker T cell expansion than redox-responsive aCD45/IL-
15Sa-NGs (Fig. 3a), suggesting that both stable cell surface retention 
and release of cytokine from NGs were important for maximal stim-
ulation. Attachment of aCD45/IL-15Sa-NGs to purified polyclonal 
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells showed similar responsiveness of both T cell 
subsets to nanogel-promoted expansion (Supplementary Fig. 7a). To 
assess the impact of a delay between T cell preparation–backpacking

and engagement with antigen in tumors, we tested the effect of incu-
bating backpacked T cells with IL-7 (to maintain T cell viability dur-
ing the incubation) for 3 d before TCR stimulation. With delayed 
stimulation, NGs still expanded the T cells in vitro, though to a lesser 
degree than that with cells stimulated immediately (Supplementary 
 
Fig. 7b). NGs enhanced T cell proliferative responses to anti-CD3/
CD28 beads at doses as low as ~30 ng IL-15Sa per 106 cells (Fig. 3c). 
IL-15Sa-backpacked T cells maintained approximately constant levels 
of IL-15Rβ (CD122) and maintained stimulation of T cells for at least 
a week in culture, as evidenced by elevated levels of pSTAT5 and Ki67 
over a 9-d period (Fig. 3d). Addition of a CD45 inhibitor did not 
alter the proliferative response to the NGs (Supplementary Fig. 8), 
 
indicating that NG anchoring did not trigger suppressive CD45 phos-
phatase activity.
T cell expansion in tumors
We next investigated the effect of NG-mediated cytokine delivery on 
ACT T cell expansion in vivo, via adoptive transfer of pmel-1 TCR-
transgenic gp100-specific T cells23 carrying aCD45/IL-15Sa-NGs in 
the syngeneic mouse model of B16F10 melanoma5. C56Bl/6 mice with 
established subcutaneous (s.c.) B16F10 flank tumors were lymphode-
pleted, then received intravenous (i.v.) adoptive transfer of primed 
pmel-1 Thy1.1+CD8+ T cells, followed by i.v. injection of 40 µg free 
IL-15Sa or of aCD45/IL-15Sa-backpacked T cells at the same cytokine 
dose (Fig. 4a). Seven days later, tissues were analyzed by flow cytometry, 
using Thy1.1 expression to distinguish ACT versus endogenous CD8+ T 
cells (Fig. 4b). ACT adjuvanted by free systemic IL-15Sa led to substan-
tial expansion of both transferred pmel-1 T cells and endogenous T cells 
in the blood (Fig. 4c), and it also expanded NK cells and CD4+ T cells

in the systemic circulation (Supplementary Fig. 9). Systemic IL-15Sa 
treatment also expanded endogenous T cells in tumor-draining lymph 
nodes (TDLNs) and tumors (Fig. 4d–f). By contrast, IL-15Sa deliv-
ered as backpacks expanded the transferred CD8+ T cells but did not 
expand endogenous T cells in any compartment (Fig. 4c–f). This lack of 
bystander stimulation was consistent with control experiments in which 
we assessed the transfer of labeled NGs to endogenous innate or adap-
tive cells in the blood 2 d after injecting backpacked pmel-1 cells; only a 
very minor population of endogenous CD8+ T cells (≤1.3%) was found 
to acquire NG fluorescence (Supplementary Fig. 10). In tumors, where 
we expected antigen recognition to accelerate IL-15Sa release from the 
NGs, there was a 16-fold greater expansion of IL-15Sa-backpacked T 
cells than pmel-1 T cells in the soluble IL-15Sa-adjuvanted group and 
1,000-fold greater expansion than the T cells without cytokine support 
 
(Fig. 4b,f). After ranking tissues in the order of expected increas-
ing antigen concentration (blood < distal LN < TDLN < tumor), we 
observed a corresponding increasing ratio of ACT T cell counts in the 
NG group versus the ACT cells in the free IL-15Sa-adjuvanted group 
(Fig. 4g). Backpacked T cells in the tumor were also still proliferating 
and producing granzyme and effector cytokines (Fig. 4h–j). Further 
evidence for the antigen-driven stimulation by the NG backpacks came 
from a comparison of T cell expansion in tumor-bearing versus con-
trol non-tumor-bearing mice. As shown in Supplementary Figure 11, 
at day 3 post transfer, T cells were already expanded by NGs in tumors, 
but not in distal LNs or LNs of non-tumor-bearing mice; by contrast, 
systemic IL-15Sa treatment resulted in a modest expansion of T cells 
in the LNs of both groups. Unlike TCR-triggered T cells, B16F10 
cells showed no extracellular reducing activity (Supplementary 
 
Fig. 12), suggesting that cytokine release in the tumors was mediated 
by T cell surface redox rather than by a reducing microenvironment 
in the tumors. NG IL-15Sa delivery thus focused cytokine action on 
the transferred T cells, and preferentially in antigen-bearing microen-
vironments in vivo.
Increased therapeutic window for adjuvant cytokine therapy
We noted that mice that received free high-dose IL-15Sa lost weight 
following therapy, which prompted us to explicitly evaluate the toxic-
ity of IL-15Sa as a function of dose and delivery modality. We treated

Figure 3 IL-15Sa-NG backpacks promote T cell expansion in vitro. (a) Fold expansion of naive CD8+ T cells that were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 
beads in the presence of surface-bound aCD45/IL-15Sa-NGs (7.5 µg IL-15Sa per 106 cells), IL-15Sa-NGs or nondegradable NGs (aCD45/IL-15Sa-
NGs(non-deg.)) or that were incubated with free IL-15Sa at equivalent doses with either a pulse for 1 h or continuous cultured with the same cytokine 
for 12 d. Data represent the mean ± 95% confidence interval (CI) (n = 3 independent samples), and P values were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and 
Tukey’s tests (data at day 9). ***P < 0.0001. (b) Representative flow cytometric analysis of carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled  
naive pmel-1 CD8+ T cells that were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 beads in the presence of surface-bound aCD45/IL-15Sa-NGs (7.5 µg IL-15Sa  
per 106 T cells) or that were incubated with an equivalent amount of free IL-15Sa for the indicated amounts of time (n = 3 independent experiments).  
(c) Representative profiles showing CFSE dilution of naive pmel-1 CD8+ T cells that were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 beads in the presence of 
various densities of surface-bound aCD45/IL-15Sa-NGs (n = 3 independent experiments). (d) Representative flow cytometric analysis of levels of the  
IL-15 surface receptors, the phosphorylated form of the transcription factor STAT5 (pSTAT5) and the proliferation marker Ki67 in naive pmel-1 CD8+  
T cells that were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 beads in the presence of surface-bound aCD45/IL-15Sa-NGs (7.5 µg IL-15Sa per 106 cells) or that

Figure 4 IL-15Sa-NGs promote specific expansion of adoptively transferred T cells in tumors. B16F10 tumor cells (0.5 × 106) were subcutaneously 
administered to Thy1.2+ C57Bl/6 mice and allowed to establish for 6 d. Mice were then sublethally lymphodepleted by irradiation on day 6, and 
were intravenously administered 10 × 106 primed pmel-1 Thy1.1+CD8+ T cells on day 7. Treatment groups included T cells alone, T cells followed 
by a systemic injection of free IL-15Sa (40 µg) and T cells coupled with aCD45/IL-15Sa-NGs (40 µg). On day 14, mice were euthanized, and tissues 
were processed and analyzed by flow cytometry (n = 4 mice/group). (a) Experimental timeline. (b) Representative flow cytometry plots showing the

stimulated cytokine production from both pmel-1 and endogenous 
T cells in the blood, in contrast to IL-15Sa that was delivered by NGs, 
for which the majority of both backpacked and endogenous T cells 
remained quiescent in the systemic circulation (Fig. 5c,d). This lack

injected subcutaneously in Thy1.2+ C57Bl/6 mice and allowed to establish tumor for 6 d. Mice were then sublethally lymphodepleted by irradiation on 
day 6, and they intravenously received an adoptive transfer of 10 × 106 activated pmel-1 Thy1.1+CD8+ T cells on day 7. Mice received injections of 
PBS (sham), T cells only, T cells followed by different doses of intravenously injected free IL-15Sa either as a single dose (immediately after adoptive 
transfer) or split into multiple doses (days 7, 10, 13 and 16), or T cells backpacked with aCD45/IL-15Sa-NG at different doses. Body weights and 
systemic cytokine, chemokine and liver enzyme levels were analyzed over time. (a) Experimental timeline and groups. (b) Body weight, normalized to

total doses of cytokine were administered as compared to that with the 
soluble bolus injections (Supplementary Fig. 13a). In healthy mice, 
treatment with >10 µg free IL-15Sa did not elicit high levels of serum 
cytokine induction21. However, in this lymphodepletion setting, ACT 
with >10 µg free IL-15Sa induced systemic cytokine release and ele-
vated levels of liver enzymes (Fig. 5e,f and Supplementary Fig. 13b), 
whereas backpacked T cells elicited basal levels of these biomarkers 
after treatment with up to the maximum administrable dosage.
To determine the effect of the increased therapeutic window 
afforded by IL-15Sa-NGs, we compared the antitumor efficacy of ACT 
with T cells only, with T cells and free IL-15Sa (at the MTD of 10 µg) 
or with NG-backpacked T cells following the same treatment scheme 
as that in Figure 5a. Tumor growth was substantially delayed in the 
 
10 µg IL-15Sa-NG group as compared to that in the T cell group with 
free IL-15Sa support at the same dose (Fig. 6a). However, tumor sup-
pression was further enhanced by increasing the cytokine-NG dose, 
with animals treated at the maximal 80 µg dose showing a 1.7-fold 
increase in median survival time relative to animals that were treated 
with the MTD of free IL-15Sa (Fig. 6a,b). Notably, despite the use of a 
xenogeneic (human) IL-15Sa cytokine, no hIL-15Sa-specific antibod-
ies (relative to background) were detected in serum following treat-
ment in any of the NG-backpack-treated groups (Supplementary 
 
Fig. 14). We also compared NG-mediated IL-15 delivery to the 
cytokine-loaded multilamellar lipid capsules that were used in our 
first report of the backpacking approach11 and found that even when 
administered at the same total cytokine dose, IL-15-NGs elicited much

greater T cell expansion in tumors and greater tumor regression than 
that with lipid nanocapsule backpacks (Supplementary Fig. 15). 
The lack of toxicity associated with NG–T cell transfer allowed us to 
achieve further antitumor efficacy by administering multiple injec-
tions of backpacked T cells. Administration of a second dose of NG–T 
cells 1 week after the first injection led to greatly improved survival and 
cures in 60% of treated mice, whereas systemic IL-15Sa treatment and 
T cells dosed twice resulted in toxicity (Supplementary Fig. 16).
Finally, we evaluated whether NG-delivered cytokine could also 
positively impact the function of CAR-T cells, which are an impor-
tant modality of T cell therapy in the clinic4. For this purpose, we 
used human CAR-T cells that targeted epidermal growth factor recep-
tor (EGFR) in a luciferase-expressing human glioblastoma model in 
immunodeficient NSG mice (Fig. 6c). CAR-T cells that were maximally 
backpacked with IL-15Sa-NGs were compared to CAR-T cells alone or 
CAR-T cells supplemented with an equivalent systemic dose of free IL-
15Sa. Transfer of 106 CAR-T cells had a small effect on tumor growth 
and survival, which did not reach statistical significance; responses 
were marginally improved by the addition of free IL-15Sa (Fig. 6d–f). 
By contrast, NG-backpacked CAR-T cells eradicated tumors in four 
of five mice (Fig. 6d–f). We also found that frozen NG-loaded CAR-T 
cells retained the ability for cytokine-driven expansion after thawing 
(Supplementary Fig. 17), a property that may be helpful for clinical 
protocols that use cryopreserved T cell products. Thus, NG delivery of 
cytokines also has the potential to enhance CAR-T cell therapy.
DISCUSSION
ACT has recently achieved notable clinical responses in certain hema-
tological cancers24. However, ACT for solid tumors has remained 
challenging, at least in part due to the immunosuppressive tumor 
microenvironment1,25. The administration of immunomodulators 
might overcome this microenvironment, but these drugs are often lim-
ited by systemic toxicities7,26. Here we demonstrated a chemical strategy 
to increase the efficacy and safety of adjuvant drug therapy for ACT, by 
linking drug delivery to TCR triggering in the tumor and TDLNs.
Two biological discoveries enabled this approach. First, we found 
that T cells modulate their cell surface redox state as a function of acti-
vation status (naive versus primed cells) and immediately following 
TCR–cognate-peptide–MHC engagement. The mechanisms underly-
ing this redox regulation remain to be defined, but they may involve 
altered expression of transmembrane reducing enzymes. The second 
key finding was the identification of CD45 as a stable, non-internaliz-
ing anchor for NGs, even when the particles exposed protein ligands 
that normally trigger endocytosis. Prior studies reported that CD45- 
targeted nano-emulsions are endocytosed after binding to CD45 expressed 
by murine macrophages27, suggesting that binding to CD45 may have 
different outcomes in different immune cell populations. Biochemical 
studies in Jurkat T cells also reported a half-life for cell-surface CD45 of 
6–15 h28, which may reflect the distinct behavior of free versus particle-
cross-linked CD45 and/or differences in the biology of primary T cells 
and cell lines. Although CD45 plays important roles in regulating T cell 
signaling at the immunological synapse29,30, anchoring of NGs to CD45 
did not affect proliferative responses to TCR–cytokine stimuli.
The identification of reaction conditions that yielded discrete nano-
particles through solution cross-linking of proteins was consistent 
with prior literature on protein micro- and nano-gels31–33. The NG 
strategy enabled high per-cell doses of protein to be delivered; by 
comparison, measurements of maximal T cell loading with a CD45-
specific monoclonal antibody suggested that use of an anti-CD45–
cytokine fusion as an alternative could achieve at best a 70-fold lower 
maximal cytokine payload.
By using TCR-responsive NGs, we reduced to practice an approach 
of spatiotemporally controlled drug delivery, linking tissue-specific 
cell signaling (here, antigen recognition) to drug release. The cross-
linker system we used responded to local changes in the redox envi-
ronment, and although some tumors are thought to intrinsically 
present a reducing state, melanomas, by contrast, have been shown 
to generate an oxidative microenvironment34. We detected no extra-
cellular reducing activity in B16F10 tumor cells that were assayed 
immediately after removal from established tumors, which suggested 
that cytokine release from the backpacks was primarily driven by 
T cell–mediated cell surface reduction. However, we can also envi-
sion NGs that are responsive to the dysregulated physiology of the 
tumor microenvironment itself. Tumors are often hypoxic, acidic and 
overexpress various proteases35. Numerous environment-responsive 
chemistries have been developed in the drug delivery field to achieve 
tissue-selective drug release—for example, particles responsive to 
tumor-enriched matrix metalloproteinases36, to acidic pH37,38 or 
to other signals35,39. Implementation of these approaches in the NG 
cross-linker to impart responsiveness to cell surface enzymes, tumor-
specific proteases or pH are a possibility.
This chemical strategy complements genetic engineering 
approaches to control the location and timing of ACT T cell activation 
and expansion. Safe delivery of cytokine support is also being pursued 
by linking cytokine expression to TCR-signaling-regulated transcrip-
tion factors40–42 and by expressing membrane-bound cytokines43. 
These and other44–47 elegant genetic approaches promote spatiotem-
poral control over CAR-T cell activity. However, chemical backpack-
ing may be more effective with cytokines that are very toxic or whose 
expression during in vitro preparation of T cells inhibits T cell expan-
sion (for example, IL-12). A constraint of the backpacking approach 
is that it is an inherently self-limiting therapy, as stimulation of cell 
division leads to dilution of the backpacked drug cargo. This does 
not preclude some durability in stimulation, as evidenced by the NG 
backpacks that continued to stimulate T cells for at least 9 d in vitro. 
Self-limiting dosing can also be viewed as an attractive built-in safe-
guard against runaway stimulation of T cells or on-target–off-tumor 
T cell activation, which can lead to serious toxicities9,48.

ONLINE METHODS
Materials. ALT-803, a human IL-15 super-agonist (Sa), obtained from Altor 
BioScience Corporation (Miramar, FL, USA) was generated as described 
previously49. IL-2-Fc, a bivalent fusion protein of the C terminus of mouse 
 
wild-type IL-2 linked to a mouse IgG2a backbone, was a generous gift from 
Dane Wittrup’s lab at MIT and was prepared as described previously50. Bovine 
serum albumin (BSA) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, 
USA). Human IgG was purchased from Jackson Immuno Research Labs (West 
Grove, PA, USA). NH2-PEG10k-NH2 was purchased from Laysan Bio (Arab, 
AL, USA). Polyethylene glycol-b-polylysine (PEG5k-PLL33k) was purchased 
from Alamanda Polymers (Huntsville, AL, USA). Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) 
suberate was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). 
Anti-mouse-CD45RB (clone: MB23G2) was purchased from BioXCell (West 
Lebanon, NH, USA). Anti-human-CD45 (clone: MEM-28) was purchased 
from Abcam (Cambridge, United Kingdom). Anti-CD3/CD28 beads were 
purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. All other chemicals and solvents 
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise noted. All reagents were 
used as received unless otherwise noted.
Mice and cell lines. Experiments and handling of mice were conducted under 
federal, state and local guidelines and with approval from the MIT IACUC. 
Six- to eight-week-old female Thy1.2+ C57Bl/6 mice, TCR-transgenic Thy1.1+ 
pmel-1 mice and Nod/SCID/IL2RG−/− (NSG) mice were from the Jackson 
Laboratory. B16F10 melanoma cells and U-87 MG human glioblastoma cells 
were acquired from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, 
USA) and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM). The 
construct expressing Click beetle red luciferase (CBR-luc) was introduced into 
U-87 MG cells by lentiviral transduction, for bioluminescence imaging.
Isolation of naive and primed mouse T cells. Spleens from C57Bl/6 or pmel-1 
Thy1.1+ mice were ground through a 70-µm cell strainer, and red blood cells 
were removed by incubation with ACK lysis buffer (2 ml per spleen) for 5 min 
at 25 °C. Naive CD4+ or CD8+ T cells were isolated from splenocytes directly 
via magnetic negative selection using an EasySep Mouse CD4+ or CD8+  
T cell Enrichment Kit (Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada), respec-
tively. For activated CD8+ T cells, the splenocytes were washed with PBS and 
then cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS, concanavalin A 
(con-A) (2 µg/ml) and IL-7 (1 ng/ml) at 37 °C for activation. After a 2-d incu-
bation period, dead cells were removed by Ficoll-Pague Plus gradient separa-
tion, and CD8+ T cells were isolated by using an EasySep Mouse CD8+ T cell 
Enrichment Kit. Purified CD8+ T cells were resuspended at 1.5 × 106 cells per 
ml in RPMI medium containing 10 ng/ml recombinant mouse IL-2. After 24 h, 
 
cells were washed three times in PBS and resuspended in buffer or medium for in 
vitro and in vivo studies. Con-A-primed mouse CD8+ T cells were used as acti-
vated T cells for all of the in vitro and in vivo studies unless otherwise stated. In 
a tumor therapy study (Supplementary Fig. 16), splenocytes from pmel-1 mice 
were isolated as described above and cultured in the presence of 1 µM human 
gp10025–33 and culture medium containing mouse IL-2 (10 ng/ml) and IL-7 
 
(1 ng/ml) for 3 d followed by Ficoll-Pague Plus gradient separation. After 
culture in the medium containing mouse IL-7 (10 ng/ml) for one more day, 
the pmel-1 CD8+ T cells (>95%) were used for ACT.
Isolation of naive and primed human CD8+ T cells. Total peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were anonymous samples obtained from healthy 
donors (New York Blood Center, Long Island City, NY, USA). Naive CD8+ T 
cells were isolated directly by using RosetteSep Human CD8+ T cell Enrichment 
Cocktail (Stemcell). The human CD8+ T cells were activated in non-tissue- 
culture plates coated with anti-human-CD3 (2.5 µg/ml) and anti-human-CD28 
(1.0 µg/ml) in the presence of human IL-2 (50 UI/ml) for 2 d. Cells were washed 
three times in PBS and resuspended in buffer or medium for in vitro studies.
Measurement of T cell surface reduction activity using the WST-1 assay.  
T cell surface reduction activity was determined by using a commercial 
WST-1 assay kit containing WST-1 and an electron coupling reagent (Roche, 
Basel, Switzerland). Naive or con-A-primed CD8+ T cells from C57Bl/6 mice 
were suspended in Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS) at 1 × 106 cells per 
ml. The commercial WST-1 reagent mixture (10 µl) was added to the T cell 
 
suspension (200 µl). The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. WST-1 formazan 
production rate was measured with a plate reader (Tecan Infinite M1000 PRO, 
Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland) for increased absorbance at 450 nm during the 
incubation. For the measurement of cell surface reduction in response to TCR 
triggering, naive or con-A-activated CD8+ T cells were incubated with anti-
CD3/CD28 beads (1:1 cell:bead ratio) or gp100 peptide (10 µg/ml) in the pres-
ence in IL-7 (1 ng/ml) at 37 °C for 24 h. Cells were washed and resuspended 
in HBSS (1 × 106 cells/ml) and measured for surface reduction with the same 
commercial WST-1 reagent mixture after a 1-h incubation at 37 °C.
Synthesis of the NHS-SS-NHS cross-linker. As shown in Supplementary 
Scheme 1, in a 125-ml round-bottom flask, 2-hydroxyethyl disulphide (1.54 g, 
 
10 mmol) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF, 30 ml, anhydrous) and 
added dropwise to the solution of phosgene (15 ml, 15 wt. % in toluene, 
 
22 mmol). The mixture was stirred at 25 °C for 10 h followed by the removal of 
the solvent under vacuum. N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) (2.3 g, 22 mmol) was 
dissolved in THF (30 ml, anhydrous) and added as one portion, and then dry 
triethylamine (1.57 ml, 11 mmol) was injected. The reaction was performed at 
40 °C for 16 h. The solvent was removed under vacuum, and the mixture was 
filtered to remove precipitates. The crude product was purified by silica gel 
column chromatography (dichloromethane:methanol, 10:1) and recrystallized 
with icy hexane (80 ml). The resulting white solid was dried under vacuum (3.1 g, 
 
yield 71%). 1H-NMR (CDCl3, 500 MHz): δ (ppm)4.58 (t, 4H), 3.05 (t, 4H), 2.84 
(s, 8H). 13C-NMR (CDCl3, 500 MHz): δ 168.77, 151.66, 68.84, 36.68, 25.69. ESI 
(m/z): calcd for C14H16N2O10S2, 436.4 [M]; found, 459.0 [M+Na]+.
Synthesis of nanogels. NHS-SS-NHS (93.5 µg, 0.214 µmol) dissolved in 
9.35 µl DMSO was added to a IL-15-Sa (1,320 µg, 0.0143 µmol) solution in 
 
132 µl PBS pH 7.4. The mixture was rotated at 25 °C for 30 min followed by 
the addition of 1,188 µl PBS buffer. For NGs that incorporated the CD45- 
targeting antibody, anti-CD45 (215 µg, 0.0014 µmol) in 31.7 µl PBS buffer was 
then added to the diluted solution. The reaction mixture was rotated at 25 °C 
for another 30 min. The preparation of IL-15Sa-NGs without anti-CD45 was 
similar except that anti-CD45 was replaced with NH2-PEG10k-NH2 (715 µg, 
0.0715 µmol) in 35.8 µl PBS buffer. Other protein NGs (IL-2Fc-NG, BSA-NG, 
IgG-NG) were prepared with similar protein concentrations and the same 
cross-linker/protein mole ratio. The resultant NGs were then washed with 
PBS (1.5 ml × 3) in an Amicon centrifugal filter (molecular weight cut-off = 
100 kDa; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Non-degradable NGs (for example, 
aCD45/IL-15Sa-NG (non-deg.)) were prepared by using a permanent linker, 
bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate in lieu of NHS-SS-NHS. To enhance conjuga-
tion of aCD45/IL-15Sa-NGs to T cells, before T cell coupling freshly prepared 
aCD45/IL-15Sa-NG solution was diluted to 1 µg/µl followed by the addition 
of polyethylene glycol-b-polylysine (PEG5k-PLL33k) (43.6 µg, 0.0011 µmol) 
in 43.6-µl PBS. The mixture was rotated at 25 °C for 30 min and used without 
further purification.
Fluorescence and biotin labeling of NGs. To prepare fluorescently labeled 
NGs, cytokine cargos were fluorescently labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 NHS 
ester (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and purified with Amicon ultracentrifugal 
filters (molecular weight cut-off 50 kDa). Fluorescent cytokine was mixed 
with nonlabeled cytokine (10 mol% labeled cytokine) for the preparation of 
fluorescent NGs following the same procedure as described above. For the 
preparation of biotinylated NGs, NHS-SS-NHS (93.5 µg, 0.214 µmol) dis-
solved in 9.35 µl DMSO was added to IL-15Sa (1,320 µg, 0.0143 µmol) solution 
in 132 µl PBS buffer. The mixture was rotated at 25 °C for 20 min followed by 
the addition of EZ-Link NHS-LC-LC-biotin (40.6 µg, 0.072 µmol, Thermo 
Fisher Scientific) in 7.5 µl DMSO. The mixture was rotated at 25 °C for another 
20 min and then diluted with 1,188 µl PBS buffer followed by the addition of 
anti-CD45 (215 µg, 0.0014 µmol) in 31.7 µl PBS buffer. The rest of the proce-
dure was the same as described above.
Characterizations of nanogels. NG formation and complete reaction of 
protein cargos was verified by HPLC with a size-exclusion column (BioSep-
SEC-s4000, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA). NG sizes were determined 
by transmission electron microscopy (FEI Tecnai, Hillsboro, OR, USA) 
and dynamic light scattering. NGs were dispersed in deionized water to 
 nature biotechnology
doi:10.1038/nbt.4181
a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. The hydrodynamic size and zeta potential 
were measured with a Malvern Zetasizer (Malvern, United Kingdom). 
The final concentrations of NGs were determined with a NanoDrop 1000 
Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Release kinetics of cytokines from nanogels. The NGs were dispersed in 
PBS (0.1 mg/ml) with or without glutathione (GSH, 1 mM) and incubated 
at 4 °C. At selected time intervals, replicates of solution were analyzed with 
HPLC equipped with a size-exclusion column to determine the percentage of 
released cytokine. Released cytokine was also subjected to a MicroFlex matrix-
absorption laser desorption instrument time-of-flight instrument (MALDI-
TOF, Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA) to determine the molecular weight.
Coupling of nanogels to T cells. In a typical experiment, aCD45/IL-15Sa-
NG (950 µg, 0.010 µmol) labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 in 950 µl PBS was 
added to mouse CD8+ T cells (95 × 106) in 475 µl HBSS followed by incu-
bation at 37 °C for 1 h. The T cells with surface-coupled NGs were collected 
by centrifugation at 800g for 5 min, washed with PBS (1.0 ml × 2) and resus-
pended in buffer or medium at the desired concentrations for in vitro or 
 
in vivo studies. For measurements of total NG coupling, fluorescently labeled 
NGs were coupled to T cells, and supernatants were collected and measured 
for fluorescence intensity at excitation and emission wavelengths of 640 nm 
 
and 680 nm, respectively, using a plate reader (Tecan Infinite M1000 PRO). 
Fluorescence readings were converted to NG concentrations using stand-
ard curves prepared from serial dilutions of NG stock solutions. The amount 
of coupled NG was calculated by subtracting the unbound NG from the 
total added amount. NG loading per cell was controlled by varying the 
mass of NGs added to cells for coupling. For the conjugation of NGs lack-
ing anti-CD45 to T cells, IL-15Sa-NG (950 µg, 0.010 µmol) in PBS (950 µl) 
was first activated with sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohe
xane-1-carboxylate (218 µg, 0.50 µmol) or bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate 
 
(286 µg, 0.50 µmol), collected with Amicon ultra-centrifugal filters (molecular 
weight cut-off 50 kDa) and washed with PBS (1.5 ml × 3), and then added to CD8+ 
T cells (95 × 106) in 475 µl HBSS followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were 
washed and collected similarly. The amount of conjugated NG was determined 
similarly as described above. Coupling of NGs with or without anti-human-CD45 
to human CD8+ T cells followed the procedures described above.
Release kinetics of proteins from NG coupled on T cell surface. Human-IgG-
Human IgG-NG labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 fluorescence dye was prepared 
and coupled to primed polyclonal C57Bl/6 CD8+ T cells as described above. 
T cells were incubated in medium at 37 °C with or without anti-CD3/CD28 
beads at a 1:1 bead:T cell ratio. Cell were collected at selected time points and 
analyzed by flow cytometry for measurement of mean fluorescence intensity 
(MFI) over time.
Preparation of liposomes with surface-conjugated antibodies and/or 
cytokines. Vacuum-dried lipid films composed of 1,2-distearoyl-sn- 
glycero-3-phospho ethanolamine-N-[maleimide(polyethylene glycol)-2000 
(maleimide-PEG2000-DSPE), cholesterol, hydrogenated soy l-α-phosphati-
dylcholine (HSPC) and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-
N-[biotinyl(polyethylene glycol)-2000 (biotin-PEG2000-DSPE) (Avanti Polar 
Lipids, Alabaster, AL, USA) in a molar ratio of 2.5:27:68:1.5 together with 1% 
of a fluorescent lipophilic tracer dye DiD were rehydrated in 250 µl of 50 mM 
4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) in a 150 mM 
NaCl buffer (pH 6.5). Lipids were mixed by vortexing every 10 min for 1 h at 
 
62 °C to form vesicles and size-extruded through a polycarbonate membrane 
(0.2 µm). After washing in excess PBS and spinning down by ultracentrifugation 
at 110,000g for 4 h, liposomes were resuspended in 100 µl PBS per 1.4 mg of lip-
ids. For coupling to the maleimide groups of the liposomes, antibody, cytokine, 
and antibody and cytokine mixtures at different molar ratios (2–5 mg/ml) 
 
were treated with 1.8 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) in the presence of 
 
10 mM EDTA at 25 °C for 20 min to expose free thiols in the hinge region. 
 
DTT was subsequently removed by using Zeba desalting columns before mix-
ing with maleimide-bearing liposomes (1:1 wt./wt. for protein:lipid) in PBS. 
After incubation for 18 h at 25 °C on a rotator, the excess protein was removed 
by ultracentrifugation using an excess of PBS.
Internalization kinetics of liposomes and nanogels by T cells. Antibody- 
conjugated liposomes (0.7 mg lipids) in 100 µl PBS were incubated with 20 × 106 
 
primed pmel-1 Thy1.1+ CD8+ T cells in 0.5 ml complete RPMI medium 
supplemented with 10% FCS for 30 min at 37 °C with gentle agitation every 
 
15 min. Conjugated T cells were washed with PBS (20 ml × 2) to remove 
unbound liposomes and incubated in RPMI medium with recombinant IL-7 
(1.5 ng/ml) and 10% FCS at 0.5 × 106 cells/ml at 37 °C. T cells with surface-
coupled biotin-labeled NGs were prepared as described above and suspended 
in RPMI medium with 10% FCS at 5.0 × 105 cells/ml at 37 °C. At staggered 
time points, replicates of cells were collected, washed with PBS buffer and 
then stained with a streptavidin-PE-Cy7 (eBioscience) conjugate to detect 
surface-localized liposomes or NGs followed by flow cytometry analysis (FACS 
Canto, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Similar assays were performed 
with anti-CD3- and anti-CD28-activated human CD8+ T cells isolated from 
human PBMCs. For confocal imaging studies, T cells with surface-coupled 
Alexa Fluor 647–labeled NGs were collected at different time points, washed 
with PBS and imaged in chamber slides using an LSM500 laser scanning con-
focal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).
In vitro proliferation assay of T cells. Naive pmel-1 CD8+ T cells were labeled 
with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) and then conjugated 
with aCD45/IL-15Sa-NG, IL-15Sa-NG, or aCD45/IL-15Sa-NG (non-deg.), 
respectively, as described above. After removing unbound NGs, T cells were 
resuspended in RPMI medium with 10% FCS (5.0 × 105 cells/ml) and added 
to anti-CD3/CD28 beads at a 1:2 bead:T cell ratio. Free IL-15Sa was added 
to the cells in control groups at an equivalent dose (pulsed or continuous). 
For the T cells pulsed with free IL-15Sa, cell medium was replaced after a 1-h 
incubation to wash out the free IL-15Sa. For all of the groups, cell medium 
was replaced every 3 d, and free IL-15Sa was replenished in the continuous 
treatment group. At selected time points, replicates of T cells were added with 
counting beads and washed with flow cytometry buffer (PBS with 2% FCS) 
followed by aqua live/dead staining. Cells were stained for surface markers 
(CD8, CD122) with antibodies followed by fixation and permeabilization with 
Intracellular Fixation & Permeabilization Buffer Set (eBioscience). Cells were 
then stained intracellularly for phosphorylated STAT5 and Ki67 and analyzed 
with a flow cytometer (BD Canto, BD Biosciences).
In vivo therapy study and T cell expansion. B16F10 melanoma cells (5.0 × 105) 
 
were administered by s.c. injection in the flanks of C57Bl/6 mice on day 0. 
Mice were sublethally lymphodepleted by total body irradiation (5 Gy) 6 d 
after tumor cell inoculation. Primed pmel-1 CD8+ T cells (1.0 × 107) alone or 
with surface-coupled NGs in 200 µl PBS were administered by i.v. injection at 
day 7. In other groups, free IL-15Sa was administered by i.v. injection imme-
diately after ACT at equivalent total doses (single or multiple doses as indi-
cated). Tumor area (product of two measured orthogonal diameters) and body 
weight were measured every 2 d. Mice were euthanized when the body weight 
loss was >20% of the pre-dosing weight, the tumor area reached 150 mm2  
(as a pre-determined end point) or the animal had become moribund.
To monitor in vivo T cell expansion and function, mice were euthanized 
on day 14 for necropsy and flow cytometry analyses. Inguinal lymph nodes 
(distal or TDLN) and spleen were ground through a 70-µm cell strainer. 
Splenocytes were then lysed with ACK lysis buffer (2 ml per spleen) for 
 
5 min at 25 °C to remove red blood cells. Blood samples (200 µl) were lysed 
with ACK lysis buffer (1 ml × 2) for 5 min at 25 °C. Tumors were weighed 
and ground through a 70-µm cell strainer. All cells were added with counting 
beads and washed with flow cytometry buffer (PBS with 2% FCS) followed by 
aqua live/dead staining. Cells were stained for surface markers (CD8, Thy1.1, 
CD4, NK1.1) with antibodies followed by fixation and permeabilization with 
Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences). Cells were then stained intracellularly for 
Ki67. After washing with FACS buffer, cells were resuspended in FACS buffer 
and analyzed by flow cytometry. For intracellular cytokine staining, samples 
in single-cell suspensions were incubated with gp100 peptide (10 µg/ml) at 
 
37 °C for 2 h followed by the addition of brefeldin A (eBioscience, San Diego, 
CA, USA) and incubation for another 4 h. Following surface staining as 
described above, samples were fixed and permeabilized in the same manner 
and stained with antibodies against interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF)-α and IL-2. Flow cytometric analysis was performed with a BD Fortessa 
 nature biotechnology
doi:10.1038/nbt.4181
instrument (BD Biosciences), and data analysis was performed using FlowJo 
software (Tree Star, Oregon, USA).
Measurement of serum cytokine levels and liver enzymes for toxicity study. 
Serum samples from treated mice as described above were collected at day 
17 or when the mice were euthanized due to toxicity, and these were then 
analyzed for cytokine levels using the Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) Mouse 
Inflammation Kit (BD Biosciences). Serum samples were also sent to IDEXX 
Reference Laboratories for analysis of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspar-
tate transaminase (AST).
Measurement of serum antibody. Serum samples were collected from treated 
mice in different groups at 30 d after ACT. Serum concentration of anti-IL-
15Sa was measured by a standard ELISA procedure with calibration of a 
human-IL-15-specific monoclonal antibody (eBioscience).
Preparation of CAR-T cells for ACT. The huEGFRscFv-BBz chimeric antigen 
receptor was designed based on the heavy and light chains of cetuximab to 
form a single-chain variable fragment, which was fused to a portion of the 
extracellular and transmembrane domains of human CD8α, followed by the 
intracellular domains of 4-1BB and CD3ζ. The bicistronic vector also encoded 
truncated human CD19 as a selectable marker, which was placed following a 
T2A ribosomal skip sequence. The plasmid coding hu EGFRscFv-BBz-CAR 
was synthesized, and lentivirus packaging was produced by VectorBuilder. 
Isolated T cells were derived from purchased leukapheresis products obtained 
from de-identified healthy donors under an IRB-approved protocol. T cells 
were stimulated with Dynabeads Human T Activator CD3/CD28 (Life 
Technologies) at a bead:cell ratio of 3:1. T cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 
medium supplemented with 10% FBS, HEPES buffer (20 mM), penicillin and 
streptomycin (1%) and IL-2 (20 IU/ml). T cells were transduced (TDN) with 
CAR lentivirus and or left untransduced (UTD) 1 d following bead stimula-
tion, and then T cells were expanded for 10 d and cryopreserved until used. 
Surface expression of the CAR was confirmed and quantified with biotinylated 
human EGFR protein (ACRO Biosystems).
Cytotoxicity assays of human CAR-T cells. The ability of EGFR-specific 
CAR-T cells to kill targets was tested in a 20-h luciferase-based killing assay. 
Transduced T cells and UTD T cells were thawed and rested for 24 h at 
 
37 °C in a 6-well plate in T cell medium. The effectors and targets were mixed 
together at the indicated effector:target (E:T) ratios and cultured in black-
walled 96-well flat-bottom plates with 3 × 104 target cells in a total volume of 
200 µl per well in T cell medium. Target cells alone were seeded at the same 
cell density to determine the maximal luciferase expression (relative light 
units; RLUmax). After 20 h, 100 µl of supernatant per well was removed, and 
 
100 µl of luciferase substrate (Bright-Glo, Promega) was added to the remain-
ing supernatant and cells. Emitted light was measured after 10 min of incuba-
tion using the BioTek (SYNERGY NEO2) plate reader. Lysis was determined as 
(1 − (RLUsample)/(RLUmax)) × 100. Two replicate experiments were performed; 
each was done in duplicate.
In vivo therapy study using human CAR-T cells. Luciferase-expressing 
 
U-87 MG human glioblastoma cells (1.0 × 106) were injected s.c. into NSG 
mice on day 0 (Jackson Laboratory). Animals received, by i.v. injection, adop-
tive transfer of activated CAR-T cells (1.0 × 106) alone or with surface-coupled 
NGs on day 7. In other groups, free IL-15Sa was administered by i.v. injection 
immediately after ACT at equivalent doses. Tumor area (product of two meas-
ured orthogonal diameters) and body weight were measured every 2 d. Mice 
were also imaged for bioluminescence every week to monitor tumor growth. 
Mice were euthanized when the body weight loss was >20% of the pre-dosing 
weight, the tumor area reached 150 mm2 (as predetermined endpoint) or the 
animal had become moribund.
In vivo bioluminescence imaging. d-luciferin (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, 
USA) suspended in PBS (15 mg/ml) was injected (150 mg/kg) i.p. 5 min 
before acquisitions. Bioluminescence images were collected on a Xenogen 
IVIS Spectrum Imaging System (Xenogen, Alameda, CA, USA). Living Image 
software Version 3.0 (Xenogen) was used to acquire and quantify the biolu-
minescence imaging data sets.
Statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad 
Prism software. All values and error bars are mean ± s.e.m., except where 
indicated differently. Comparisons of tumor growth over time were performed 
by using two-way ANOVA tests, and comparisons of multiple groups at a sin-
gle time point were performed by using one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s tests. 
Survival data were analyzed using the log-rank test. Further information on 
experimental design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary 
linked to this article.
Ethics statement. Experiments and handling of mice were conducted under 
federal, state and local guidelines and with approval from the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology IACUC.
