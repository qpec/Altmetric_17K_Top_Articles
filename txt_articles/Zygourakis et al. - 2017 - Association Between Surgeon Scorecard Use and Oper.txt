IMPORTANCE Despite the significant contribution of surgical spending to health care costs,
most surgeons are unaware of their operating room costs.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association between providing surgeons with individualized cost
feedback and surgical supply costs in the operating room.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The OR Surgical Cost Reduction (OR SCORE) project
was a single–health system, multihospital, multidepartmental prospective controlled study in
an urban academic setting. Intervention participants were attending surgeons in orthopedic
surgery, otolaryngology–head and neck surgery, and neurological surgery (n = 63). Control
participants were attending surgeons in cardiothoracic surgery, general surgery, vascular
surgery, pediatric surgery, obstetrics/gynecology, ophthalmology, and urology (n = 186).
INTERVENTIONS From January 1 to December 31, 2015, each surgeon in the intervention
group received standardized monthly scorecards showing the median surgical supply direct
cost for each procedure type performed in the prior month compared with the surgeon’
s
baseline (July 1, 2012, to November 30, 2014) and compared with all surgeons at the
institution performing the same procedure at baseline. All surgical departments were eligible
for a financial incentive if they met a 5% cost reduction goal.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was each group’
s median surgical
supply cost per case. Secondary outcome measures included total departmental surgical
supply costs, case mix index–adjusted median surgical supply costs, patient outcomes
(30-day readmission, 30-day mortality, and discharge status), and surgeon responses to a
postintervention study-specific health care value survey.
RESULTS The median surgical supply direct costs per case decreased 6.54% in the
intervention group, from $1398 (interquartile range [IQR], $316-$5181) (10 637 cases) in 2014
to $1307 (IQR, $319-$5037) (11 820 cases) in 2015. In contrast, the median surgical supply
direct cost increased 7.42% in the control group, from $712 (IQR, $202-$1602) (16 441 cases)
in 2014 to $765 (IQR, $233-$1719) (17 227 cases) in 2015. This decrease represents a total
savings of $836 147 in the intervention group during the 1-year study. After controlling for
surgeon, department, patient demographics, and clinical indicators in a mixed-effects model,
there was a 9.95% (95% CI, 3.55%-15.93%; P = .003) surgical supply cost decrease in the
intervention group over 1 year. Patient outcomes were equivalent or improved after the
intervention, and surgeons who received scorecards reported higher levels of cost awareness
on the health care value survey compared with controls.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Cost feedback to surgeons, combined with a small
departmental financial incentive, was associated with significantly reduced surgical supply
costs, without negatively affecting patient outcomes.

M
orethan50millioninpatientsurgicalprocedureswere
performed in the United States in 2010, costing ap-
proximately $175 billion.1 Operating room (OR) costs
can account for more than 40% of hospitalization costs for sur-
gical patients,2 with disposable supplies (implantable and
nonimplantable items, such as spinal hardware, hemostatic
agents, and sutures) representing a large portion of overall OR
costs. Whereas clinicians cannot easily address some drivers of
highsurgicalcosts(eg,labororhospitalindirectcosts),individual
surgeonscandirectlycontrolthesuppliestheyuseforaparticu-
lar operation either through their preference card (a list of sup-
pliesandequipmentneededforaspecificcase)orrequestsmade
in the OR. This system results in significant variability in surgi-
cal supply use by different surgeons, leading to large cost dif-
ferencesforsimilarproceduresatasingleinstitution,oftenwith-
out proven effect on patient outcomes.3 Despite their major
influenceonORsurgicalsupplychoice,mostsurgeonshavelittle
knowledge of their OR costs. A recent national survey of ortho-
pedic surgeons found that they correctly estimated the cost of
acommonlyusedimplantonly21%ofthetime,andtheirguesses
ranged from 0.02 to 24.6 times the actual cost of the item.4
This finding is not surprising given that health care pro-
fessionals, who drive more than 80% of use,5 often do not re-
ceive the information they need to include cost as a factor in
their decision making. However, growing evidence shows that
physicians are increasingly concerned about the rising cost of
health care, and consumer-facing health care cost transpar-
ency is gaining momentum nationwide.6-10 Although early
studies11-13 found limited or no success in changing physician
behavior through cost transparency efforts, more recent work
suggeststhatsurgeonsmaychoosealower-costdisposablesur-
gical supply in the OR when presented with cost feedback14
or forgo an expensive postoperative computed tomographic
scan in a neurologically intact patient.15
These prior investigations were retrospective and small,
limited to a single specialty or procedure type.14,16,17 There-
fore, we sought to perform a prospective controlled study
across multiple surgical departments to examine the associa-
tionbetweenprovidingsurgeonswithindividualizedcostfeed-
back and surgical supply costs in the operating room.
Methods
Study Design
Asingle–healthsystem,multihospital,multidepartmentalpro-
spective controlled study, OR Surgical Cost Reduction (OR
SCORE) project, was conducted from January 1 to December
31, 2015, and was sponsored by the University of California,
SanFrancisco(UCSF)CenterforHealthcareValueCaringWisely
program and UCSF Health. The study was conducted as part
of UCSF Health hospital’
s quality improvement initiatives and
was exempt from human participants review. Publication was
approved by the UCSF Committee on Human Research.
Intervention
Data from electronic medical records (Epic; Epic Systems Cor-
poration) were aggregated and summarized in a software pro-
gram(R,version3.1.3;RDevelopmentCoreTeam).Wethenused
macros (Visual Basic; Microsoft Excel) to create individualized
surgeon scorecards (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). These score-
cards show the median surgical supply direct cost for each pro-
cedure type (eg, total knee replacement) that the surgeon per-
formedinthepriormonthcomparedwiththesurgeon’
sbaseline
(July1,2012,toNovember30,2014)andcomparedwithallUCSF
surgeons performing the same procedure at baseline.
Surgical supplies included all disposable and implant-
able items (eg, spinal hardware, hemostatic agents, and su-
tures) and excluded instrument sets or multiuse equipment,
such as microscopes. For each procedure type, scorecards
showed the top 10 most expensive items (by unit cost), the top
10 most frequently used items, and the top 10 “bang for your
buck” items, which were the most frequently used items mul-
tiplied by the unit cost and represented the most significant
source of potential cost savings.
All attending surgeons in the orthopedic surgery, otolar-
yngology–headandnecksurgery(OHNS),andneurologicalsur-
gery departments operating at the main UCSF Health hospi-
tal (n = 63) received monthly scorecards (eFigure 1 in the
Supplement) via email from January 1 to December 31, 2015,
and were categorized as the intervention group. Attending sur-
geons in cardiothoracic surgery, general surgery, vascular sur-
gery, pediatric surgery, obstetrics/gynecology, ophthalmol-
ogy,andurology(n = 186)didnotreceivescorecardsandserved
as the control group.
Physician champions in the intervention departments de-
livered educational presentations to prepare surgeons for re-
ceiving scorecards and to encourage cost reduction at their de-
partmental meetings. All surgical departments (intervention
andcontrol)wereeligiblefora$50 000financialincentivefrom
the UCSF Health hospital’
s administration to be used for aca-
demicorresearchpurposesiftheymeta5%costreductiongoal.
The financial incentive was approved by the chief medical offi-
cer and publicized at the surgical chair’
s meeting. Depart-
ments received the incentive if their median surgical supply
costs per case in 2015 decreased 5% compared with 2014 af-
ter adjusting for the case mix index (CMI), a measure of case
complexity that represents the weighted mean of all diagnosis-
related groups associated with a given patient.
Primary Outcome
The primary outcome was the median surgical supply direct

Key Points
Question What is the association between providing surgeons
with individualized cost feedback and surgical supply costs?
Findings In this case-control study, surgeons in the intervention
group received cost feedback scorecards during the study period,
while those in the control group did not. The median surgical
supply direct costs per case decreased 6.54% in the intervention
group compared with a 7.42% increase in the control group.
Meaning Cost feedback to surgeons was associated with
significantly reduced surgical supply costs.

control) from January 1 to December 31, 2015, compared with
January 1 to December 31, 2014. Interquartile ranges (IQRs) are
given where appropriate.
Secondary Outcomes
There were 4 secondary outcomes. These outcome measures
included (1) total spending on surgical supply costs by inter-
vention group and by department, (2) CMI-adjusted median
surgical supply costs per case for each department, (3) pa-
tientoutcomes(30-dayreadmission,30-daymortality,anddis-
charge status), and (4) surgeon responses to a postinterven-
tion study-specific health care value survey.
We determined the observed total spending (in US dol-
lars) for each group (intervention vs control) by obtaining the
mean observed cost of surgical supplies per case for each de-
partmentineachyearfrom2012to2015multipliedbythenum-
ber of cases performed. We calculated the difference be-
tween the total observed cost and the total expected cost for
each case by subtracting the previous year’
s departmental
mean cost from the total case cost multiplied by the appro-
priate rate of inflation from the US Consumer Price Index,18
which was 1.5% from 2012 to 2013, 1.6% from 2013 to 2014,
and 0.1% from 2014 to 2015. We then calculated the mean dif-
ference in observed vs expected spending per case (by depart-
ment and group) and reported 95% CIs.

To confirm that quality of care was not compromised dur-

Health hospital’
s surgical patients from January 1, 2014, to De-
cember 31, 2015. These measures included readmission within
30 days of discharge, mortality within 30 days of discharge,
and discharge to a location other than home (eg, skilled nurs-
ing facility or rehabilitation center).
Finally, we distributed an anonymous, study-specific sur-
vey (online via Qualtrics [https://www.qualtrics.com/]) to sur-
gical attendings after the intervention to assess the efficacy of
the OR SCORE study and individual attitudes toward OR costs
and health care value (eTable 1 in the Supplement). The survey
wascompletedby91of249attendingsurgeons,representingan
overall response rate of 36.5% and a response rate of 47.6% (30
of 63) for intervention surgeons who received scorecards.
Statistical Analysis
To determine if the changes in the primary outcome (surgical
supply cost) were statistically significant, we built a model to
accountforvariousproceduretypesperformedbydifferentsur-
geons, patient demographics, and clinical indicators. This time
seriesmixed-effectsmodeltestedthehypothesisthatthetrend
in surgical supply cost per case decreased significantly in the
intervention group in 2015 compared with 2014 after control-
ling for these factors. We first performed a log transformation
of the surgical supply cost per case because of the skewed na-
ture of the data. The main effect of the intervention was cap-
tured by the interaction term between the intervention
group × days after intervention to allow for the change in cost
associated with the intervention period in 2015 in this time se-
ries analysis. Logarithmic estimates were converted back into
percentage changes in cost. To account for the differential ef-
fect of departments and the fact that surgeons tend to perform
differenttypesofprocedures,weincludeddepartmentandsur-
geoninthemodelasrandomeffects.Additionalcovariates(pa-
tient sex, patient age, payer [commercial, Medicaid, Medicare,
or other], and American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA]
classification20)wereaddedtothemodelasfixedeffectstocon-
trol for other potential sources of cost variation between pre-
intervention and postintervention and intervention vs control
groups. The CMI could not be included in this model because
it is available for only inpatient cases. Therefore, we included
the ASA classification as an indicator of patient severity of ill-
ness owing to its known correlation with postoperative re-
source use and surgical morbidity and mortality.21,22
For our secondary patient outcomes, we built a time se-
ries mixed-effects model similar to the one described above
that included only inpatient cases and added the CMI as a fixed
variable. We also constructed mixed-effects models to deter-
mine if there was a significant difference in any of the 3 pa-
tientoutcomes(30-dayreadmission,30-daymortality,anddis-
charge to a location other than home) after implementing the
OR SCORE study in our intervention group in 2015. In these
models, we included department and surgeon as random ef-
fects and included patient sex, patient age, payer, ASA classi-
fication, intervention vs control group, 2015 vs 2014, and the
interaction term of intervention × control with 2015 vs 2014
as fixed effects. Finally, for the secondary outcome of survey
responses, we used 2-sample t tests to compare results be-
tween the intervention vs control surgeons.
All statistical analyses were performed using computer
software. These programs included R version 3.1.3 (R Devel-
opment Core Team) and JMP Pro 12.01 (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
Primary Outcome
The median surgical supply direct costs per case decreased
6.54% in the intervention group, from $1398 (IQR, $316-
$5181) (10 637 cases) in 2014 to $1307 (IQR, $319-$5037) (11 820
cases) in 2015. In contrast, the median surgical supply direct
costincreased7.42%inthecontrolgroup,from$712(IQR,$202-
$1602) (16 441 cases) in 2014 to $765 (IQR, $233-$1719) (17 227
cases) in 2015 (Figure). The time series mixed-effects model
showed that this difference was statistically significant after
adjusting for surgeon, department, patient demographics, and
clinical indicators. The intervention group had a mean sav-
ings of 0.03% (95% CI, 0.01%-0.05%) per day, or 9.95% (95%
CI, 3.55%-15.93%; P = .003) over 1 year after the initiation of

s
spending increased by $3 073 647 in 2015 ($178; 95% CI, $126-

ment’
s total spending, the OHNS and orthopedic surgery in-
terventiondepartmentshadmuchgreatersavings($215 173and
$2 140 923, respectively, in 2015) than the only 2 control de-
partments with savings (obstetrics/gynecology saved $21 367,
and ophthalmology saved $137 909 in 2015).
eFigure 1 in the Supplement shows that the intervention
grouphadhigherthanexpectedspendingin2013and2014and
that the decreased spending occurred specifically in the 2015
intervention year. In contrast, the control group increased its
spending significantly in 2015.
CMI-Adjusted Median Surgical Supply Costs
The CMI-adjusted median surgical supply cost per case de-
creasedintheinterventiongroup(−3.95%)andincreasedinthe
controlgroup(5.07%)in2015vs2014(Table3).Anothermixed-
effects model showed that this difference was statistically sig-
nificantafteradjustingforsurgeon,department,patientdemo-
graphics, and clinical indicators, including the ASA classifica-
tion and CMI in this subset of inpatient cases (eTable 2 in the
Supplement).
Two intervention departments (OHNS and orthopedic sur-
gery)and1controldepartment(ophthalmology)hadmorethan
5% decreases in the CMI-adjusted median surgical supply cost
per case (−8.22%, −5.63%, and −34.0%, respectively) (Table 3).
As a result, these 3 departments received the financial incen-
tive for achieving their cost reduction targets. Ophthalmol-
ogy had a particularly large percentage change in the CMI-
adjusted cost but a small number of inpatient cases (40 of 2846
total ophthalmology cases in 2015).
Patient Outcomes
After controlling for surgeon, department, patient demograph-
ics, and clinical indicators in mixed-effects models, there was
no significant difference in 30-day readmission in the inter-
vention vs control groups in 2015 vs 2014 (odds ratio, 1.10; 95%
CI, 0.94-1.30; P = .25) (Table 4). Thirty-day mortality (odds ra-
tio, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.11-0.67; P = .005) and discharge to a loca-
tion other than home (odds ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.70-0.88;

22 of 29 (75.9%) reported that they always, often, or some-
times used the scorecard data to influence OR surgical supply
use (eFigure 2 in the Supplement).

was associated with a significant reduction in surgical supply
costs compared with surgeons who did not receive score-
cards but were still eligible for the same financial incentive.
There was a 6.54% decrease in the median surgical supply di-
rect costs per case in the intervention group compared with a
7.42% increase in the control group, a trend that persisted af-
ter adjusting for the CMI in inpatient cases. Although the per-
centage decrease was small, it led to substantial savings of
$836 147 in 2015 in our intervention group. Savings were sig-
nificant even after controlling for surgeon, department, pa-
tient demographics, and clinical indicators in a time series
mixed-effects model. Three basic patient outcomes were
equivalent or improved after the intervention, suggesting that
our intervention did not negatively influence the quality of
patient care.
Our intervention effect magnitude is similar to that re-
ported in several smaller studies. One group found that cost
feedback to a single urologist led to a 17% cost decrease for ro-
bot-assisted partial nephrectomies and laparoscopic donor
nephrectomies,14 and another group reported that giving cost
report cards to 4 general surgeons resulted in a 10% cost de-
crease in gastric bypass procedures.17 A third study16 de-
scribed a 10% cost decrease for laparoscopic cholecystecto-
mies after educating 15 surgeons about the cost of disposable
supplies.
To our knowledge, this study represents the largest and
only controlled study of cost feedback that targets surgeons
across several specialties and a broad range of procedures. Like
other studied approaches,17 our scorecards feed into physi-
cians’competitive nature by comparing them with their peers.
Our approach empowers individual health care professionals
to make their own decisions regarding resource use rather than
relying on mandates from administrators or payers. This
method also aligns with the growing movement for self-
regulation of physicians’cost of care through national pro-
grams like Choosing Wisely.23 In our study-specific survey,
87.7% (50 of 57) of surgeons stated that they are partially
responsible to help control OR costs. This percentage is sig-
nificantly greater than the 36% of practicing physicians who
reported in a 2013 survey that they have a “major responsibil-
ity” in reducing health care costs.24 This difference may
reflect increasing cost consciousness and sense of personal
responsibility during the past few years or a difference in sur-
vey wording and physician specialty.
Limitations
One study limitation is that we cannot definitively say that the
OR SCORE study feedback directly led to cost reduction but
rather that there is a significant association between score-
card use and cost reduction in the intervention group that is
not seen in the control group. This difference persisted even
after we adjusted for surgeon, department, patient demo-
graphics, and clinical indicators in our statistical model. We
do not know if the scorecards would be effective at reducing
costs without a financial incentive because all surgical depart-
ments were eligible for the financial incentive. Moreover, we
only provided scorecards to attending surgeons, but surgical
residents, nurses, and scrub technicians are important mem-
bers of the OR team who contribute to surgical supply use and
might benefit from cost information. It is challenging to give
scorecards to these individuals because they are often in-
volved in multiple cases with different attendings and ser-
vices. However, more direct involvement of trainees and nurs-
ing staff might improve the effect of our intervention.

Our results demonstrate that certain departments were
more successful than others at reducing costs, an important
considerationforotherstryingtoreplicatethisintervention.Two
control departments (obstetrics/gynecology and ophthalmol-
ogy)decreasedtheircostswithoutreceivingtheORSCOREstudy
feedback, while a single intervention department (neurologi-
cal surgery) did not reduce its costs. This finding highlights the
fact that many factors affect year-to-year surgical costs, as well
as that variables like departmental culture and leadership in-
fluence the success of cost feedback interventions in nonuni-
form ways. This consideration is the main reason we included
surgical department as a random effect in our statistical mod-
els. In addition, small changes in low-cost straightforward pro-
cedures, such as the adoption of generic eyedrops in ophthal-
mological cases, or the discontinuation of an expensive
morcellator in gynecological procedures because of US Food
and Drug Administration25 safety warnings can have a sig-
nificant influence on overall cost, as seen in 2 of our control
groups. In contrast, cost containment may be increasingly
challenging for departments like neurological surgery that
perform more diverse and complex procedures in which a
greater number of changes are needed to see a significant
cost reduction.
Conclusions
The prospective controlled OR SCORE study showed that cost
feedback to surgeons, combined with a small departmental fi-
nancial incentive, was associated with significantly reduced
surgical supply costs. Basic patient outcomes were equiva-
lent or improved after the intervention, and surgeons who re-
ceivedscorecardsreportedhigherlevelsofcostawarenesscom-
pared with controls on our study-specific survey.

Invited Commentary
Use of an Operating Room Scorecard—Keeping Score
and Cutting Costs
Andrew M. Ibrahim, MD; Justin B. Dimick, MD, MPH
There are a lot of uncertainties with how shifts to alternative
payment models (eg, value-based purchasing and bundle
payments) will affect the delivery and cost of care. One cer-
tainty, however, is that hospital margins will get tighter. In
a cost-conscious environ-
ment, surgeons will need to
come to the table to help
tackle costs at their hospital.
While we are key players of the hospitals’most expensive re-
sources (ie, the operating room), we are rarely informed how
ourdecisionschangethefinancialbottomline.Only21%ofsur-
geons accurately estimate the cost of the supplies they use,1
and even know less about the costs of clinically appropriate
alternatives. In the goal of trying to reduce health care costs,
surgeons have been put on the field without knowing the
score—until now.
In this issue of JAMA Surgery, Zygourakis and colleagues2
present evidence that gives surgeons an opportunity to re-
duce costs in the operating room. In a prospective, multihos-
pital, multi-institutional case-control study, the authors pro-
vided surgeons with monthly scorecards detailing their
procedure-specific itemized expenses. Each scorecard also in-
cluded comparisons of the surgeons’historical spending and
that of their peers. During 1 year, the authors found that sur-
geonswhoreceivedscorecardswereabletoreducesupplycosts
by 9.95%. Most important, the authors also found that rates
of complications during the same period did not worsen and
in some cases even improved. In doing so, this study sig-
nificantly builds on previous smaller reports demonstrating
that, when given the right information, surgeons can be key
players in reducing health care costs.
There are, however, certain nuances that need to be con-
sidered when implementing this type of scorecard. Specifi-
cally, it is important to understand that there are 2 key types of
costvariationthatsurgeonscaninfluence.Ontheonehand,cost
reduction may be achieved by simply changing supplies (eg,
using a less expensive mesh for hernia repair). Doing so may re-
quire little or no new training for a surgeon and not influence
patient outcomes. In contrast, cost reduction may be achieved
by changing the surgical approach (eg, the use of laparoscopy
for abdominal procedures). While this alternative may result in
lower costs by shortening hospital stays and decreasing com-
plications,suchachangewouldrequireinvestmenttoteachsur-
geonsnewskillsandrevisetheirtechnique.Inotherwords,some
cost variation may be easier to remediate than others.
Nonetheless, the approach outlined by Zygourakis and
colleagues2 reveals that an operating room scorecard can read-
ily facilitate finding safe opportunities to reduce expenses. If
we want to engage surgeons in cutting costs, we have to start
by letting them know the score.
