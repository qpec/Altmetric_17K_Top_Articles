physiol.00613.2016.—Exercise results in the rapid remodeling of skeletal muscle.
This process is underpinned by acute and chronic changes in both gene and protein
synthesis. In this short review we provide a brief summary of our current
understanding regarding how exercise influences these processes as well as the
subsequent impact on muscle protein turnover and resultant shift in muscle
phenotype. We explore concepts of ribosomal biogenesis and the potential role of
increased translational capacity vs. translational efficiency in contributing to mus-
cular hypertrophy. We also examine whether high-intensity sprinting-type exercise
promotes changes in protein turnover that lead to hypertrophy or merely a change
in mitochondrial content. Finally, we propose novel areas for future study that will
fill existing knowledge gaps in the fields of translational research and exercise
science.

THE STUDY OF HOW exercise impacts human skeletal muscle
protein turnover is a rapidly evolving area of scientific re-
search, which is testament to the critical role that skeletal
muscle plays in the development and maintenance of human
health (72, 94). Here, we provide a brief overview of our
current understanding of exercise-induced skeletal muscle ad-
aptation. Specifically, we focus on the time-course change in
the transcriptional response of skeletal muscle to exercise and
how changes in gene expression relate to the synthesis of new
muscle proteins and subsequent phenotypic adaptation. We
refer primarily to human studies, but when appropriate, other
experimental models are cited to substantiate our points.
Skeletal muscle is a highly plastic tissue, capable of adapting
to fine changes in nutritional intake and contractile activity. For
instance, resistance exercise results in a mild stimulation in
rates of muscle protein breakdown (MPB) but a greater stim-
ulation of the rates of muscle protein synthesis (MPS) (4, 62,
71). When resistance exercise is performed before protein
ingestion, there is a synergistic combination of the two stimuli
such that rates of MPS are stimulated over and above those of
MPB (11, 12, 39). Thus repeated bouts of resistance exercise
when coupled with protein ingestion result in the accretion of
skeletal muscle protein referred to as hypertrophy (17). Impor-
tantly, by changing the nature of the exercise stimulus, it is
possible to redirect the focus of the type of skeletal muscle
proteins that are being synthesized during the recovery period.
For example, we know that prolonged and repeated lower-load
dynamic stimulation of skeletal muscle (i.e., endurance exer-
cise training) results in an increase in the expression of mito-
chondrial genes (65), proteins (30, 44, 65), and ultimately
enhanced mitochondrial content (35), leading to a shift toward
an oxidative phenotype and improved fatigue resistance (31).
Resistance exercise training also stimulates the transcription of
genes and accrual of new muscle proteins (60, 63), but these
genes and proteins are largely associated with the myofibrillar
protein fraction (16, 92). However, during the early stages of
exercise training, particularly in training naïve participants,
there is a significant increase in the expression of genes
common to both modalities of exercise (34, 88). It is only with
sustained exercise training that there is a �fine tuning� of the
transcriptome, the protein synthetic response, and then the
proteome that gives rise to divergent hypertrophic and oxida-
tive phenotypes (34, 56).
Transcriptional Responses to Exercise Training
The biological basis of exercise-induced phenotypic changes
in skeletal muscle is that exercise stimulates repeated increases
in mRNA expression resulting in enhanced translation of the
protein and ultimately adaptive changes in muscle protein
content (31, 56). The temporal pattern of these changes with
respect to endurance and resistance exercise training is now
becoming clearer. Exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesis,

 for example, is a characteristic feature of endurance exercise
training (30, 31, 85) and is underpinned by the coordinated
upregulation of both mitochondrial and nuclear transcripts that
encode for proteins involved in the electron transport chain
(76–78) and lipid metabolism (36). These transcripts include
peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor-�
coactivator
(PGC)-1�, nuclear respiratory factors (NRFs), and the mito-
chondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) (46, 47, 69). An acute
bout of endurance exercise activates sensors of cellular stress
(65, 95), decreases methylation of promoter regions (6), stim-
ulates phosphorylation of mediators of translation initiation
(92), and increases the expression of the aforementioned tran-
scripts (PGC-1�, NRFs, and TFAM) (31, 65). The transient
increase in the expression of genes in the hours following an
acute endurance exercise bout provides the gene template that
precedes the respective increase in protein content observed
during exercise training (30, 65). Taking exercise-induced
changes in PGC-1� as an example: a seminal study showed
that an acute bout of endurance exercise in humans stimulated
an increase in PGC-1� mRNA peaking ~10-fold above base-
line at 4 h postexercise but returned to baseline levels the
following day (65). Further endurance exercise sessions con-
tinued to result in increases in PGC-1� mRNA expression, but
the magnitude of the increase progressively declined. Corre-
sponding changes in PGC-1� protein content were not detect-
able until 24 h after the initial exercise bout. There was also a
rapid upregulation in both citrate synthase and �-hydroxyacyl
CoA dehydrogenase mRNA following the first exercise ses-
sion; however, there was no significant change in their protein
expression until 1 wk of training (65). Others have also
demonstrated changes in PGC-1� mRNA coupled with de-
layed increases in mitochondrial content with short-term (2
wk) endurance exercise training (30). One caveat of these
studies is that no direct measurements of mitochondrial protein
synthesis were made; nevertheless, it is quite clear that, at least
with endurance exercise training, mitochondrial adaptations
occur in a tightly coordinated (mRNA to protein) and time
(hours to days)-dependent manner (30, 65, 69).
Changes in Translational Efficiency and Capacity with
Resistance Exercise
Compared with our understanding of transcriptional re-
sponses to endurance training, the corresponding picture with
respect to resistance exercise is relatively less complete. What
is known is that resistance exercise results in a phosphoryla-
tion/activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex
1 (mTORC1) (5, 29, 41, 59). mTORC1 activation serves to
enhance MPS by activating downstream protein kinases such
as the ribosomal protein of 70-kDa S6 kinase 1 (p70S6K1) and
4E-binding protein-1 (4EBP1) that subsequently promote ribo-
somal binding to mRNA to initiate protein synthesis (38, 45,
55, 70), as well as upregulating the transcription of the trans-
lational machinery itself (mRNA, ribosomes) (19). Thus resis-
tance exercise stimulates mTORC1 activity, promoting in-
creases in the rates of myofibrillar MPS through both increased
translational efficiency (protein synthesized per unit of mRNA)
and translational capacity (the abundance of the translational
machinery; ribosomes) (5, 29).
The relative contribution of resistance exercise-induced
changes in translational capacity and translational efficiency to
the ensuing hypertrophic phenotype has yet to be fully defined.
To date, many studies informing the time-course change in
translational responses to resistance exercise are in fact con-
ducted in rodents (18, 43, 91). One of the most recent, but also
comprehensive, studies using this model has demonstrated that
resistance exercise results in a transient increase in mTORC1
activity (up to 18 h postexercise) but a more prolonged stim-
ulation of protein synthesis (0–36 h) (91). Interestingly, read-
outs of ribosomal biogenesis were also increased at 12–36 h of
recovery, which preceded a trend for an increase in total RNA
at 18–36 h. Given that ~85% of RNA is ribosomal RNA
(rRNA), it is possible that while the initial increase in MPS was
predominantly attributed to mTORC1-mediated translational
efficiency, the sustained elevations in MPS during the latter
stages of recovery might have been supported by increased
translational capacity. It is, however, important to note that
treatment with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin significantly
reduced RNA content as well as the expression of the internal
transcribed spacer 1 (estimate of ribosomal DNA transcription
rate) at 18 h but only marginally reduced rates of MPS. This
finding suggests that other factors, in addition to mTORC1
activity and improved translational capacity, contributed to
sustaining rates of MPS during recovery in this study (91).
As a result of important proof-of-concept data generated in
rodent models of resistance exercise, the response of the
ribosomal pool to resistance exercise in humans is beginning to
be understood (32, 33, 83, 84). Studies have shown that acute
resistance exercise increases readouts of ribosomal biogenesis
as well total RNA in the hours following a single resistance
exercise bout (33, 63, 83). Episodic increases in the expression
and content of ribosomal proteins with each successive bout of
resistance exercise have been proposed to support long-term
gains in skeletal muscle mass with resistance exercise training
(14, 91). Indeed, it is known that even two bouts of resistance
exercise are sufficient to increase total RNA content (10).
Increases in total RNA and 45S pre-rRNA have also been
reported following 3 wk (14) and 6 wk (63) of resistance
exercise training respectively, but these increases may be
short-lived since ribosomal gene expression (45S pre-rRNA)
and ribosomal transcription (c-Myc) expression have been
shown to return to baseline levels after 12 wk of training (63).
Similarly, others have demonstrated that in response to 20 wk
of resistance exercise training there is a downregulation in the
expression of rRNA in individuals who displayed the greatest
magnitude of muscle hypertrophy (67). Reconciling the incon-
gruent findings between studies is difficult due to obvious
differences in experimental designs and participant cohorts.
However, we speculate that at the onset of resistance training
there is an initial increase in ribosomal capacity to support an
overall �nonspecific� protein remodeling response followed by
attenuation of ribosomal content over time that accompanies a
more �specific� response (Fig. 1). This concept differs slightly
from those primarily based on rodent studies of hypertrophy
(90) that have employed a synergist ablation model of overload
where a constant load is applied and magnitudes of up to 40%
hypertrophy are achieved within a matter of days (40). Such
magnitudes of muscle growth are hardly indicative of those
observed in human models of resistance exercise training and
it is therefore unlikely that they would share the same biolog-
ical signature of hypertrophy. More work is now needed that
brings together a detailed time course of gene transcription,

 ribosomal protein content, and muscle hypertrophy during a
period of resistance exercise training in humans.
Changes in Muscle Protein Synthesis with Resistance
Exercise Training
An acute bout of resistance exercise is known to stimulate
rates of MPS (68). It is only following the ingestion of protein
that rates of MPS exceed those of muscle protein breakdown,
resulting in a positive muscle protein balance and net protein
accretion (11, 12). Initial work from our laboratory (61) and
later by others (93), demonstrated that the ingestion of 20 g of
high-quality protein is sufficient to maximize postexercise rates
of MPS during 4 h of recovery, with the consumption of 40 g
eliciting no further increase in MPS but instead, stimulating
whole body leucine oxidation (61). Extending these findings,
Areta et al. (2) showed that the consumption of 20 g of
high-quality protein every 3 h was superior for the stimulation
of MPS over a 12-h recovery period as compared with ingest-
ing 10 g every 1.5 h or 40 g every 6 h. However, an important
caveat of these reports is that the exercise protocols were
limited to lower body exercise regimens. The argument could
therefore be made that in exercise protocols that utilize whole
body protocols, the increase in contractile skeletal muscle mass
may create a greater demand for ingested protein to remodel
skeletal muscle proteins. A recent study, in which healthy
young resistance-trained men performed whole body resistance
exercise, showed that the ingestion of 40 g of protein
resulted in a 16% greater stimulation of MPS during 5 h of
recovery as compared with 20 g (54). Taken together with
the results of previous work showing that the ingestion of
20 g of protein was sufficient saturate postexercise rates of
MPS with lower body resistance exercise (2, 61, 93), these
data (54) would suggest that the ingested protein dose to
maximize rates of MPS following whole body resistance ex-
ercise could be greater than 20 g. However, it is important to
note that this thesis was not specifically tested in the afore-
mentioned study (54).
Although rates of MPS are elevated in the hours after a bout
of resistance exercise, it is important to note that skeletal
muscle can retain sensitivity to the anabolic influence of
protein ingestion for up to 24 h (15) and likely up to at least
48 h (21). Moreover, it is unlikely that this increase is solely
directed toward accretion of proteins to result in hypertrophy.
Rather, the elevated rates of MPS during the early stages of
recovery from resistance exercise are likely to be indicative of
a greater remodeling of contractile and structural proteins. In
humans, both MPS and MPB are known to be higher in the
hours and days following resistance exercise with rates of MPS
exceeding those of breakdown (68). Due to technical limita-
tions associated with the measurement of MPB outside of a
laboratory setting, our understanding of how rates of MPB
change in the days during recovery from resistance exercise is
limited. However, it has been shown that absolute and frac-
tional integrated rates of MPS are increased early (i.e., �3 wk)
during resistance training but are adaptively reduced over time
(14, 24). We reported that in participants who performed
resistance exercise training for 10 wk that integrated rates of
MPS measured 48 h following a single bout of resistance
exercise were significantly higher following the first bout of
exercise but were then lower at the 3rd and 10th week of
training (24). Moreover, there was a corresponding increase in
Z-line streaming (indicative of muscle damage) after the first
bout of resistance exercise training that was also diminished
over the duration of the resistance exercise training protocol.
When MPS was normalized to the area of Z-band streaming in
an attempt to account for the relative contribution of MPS to
repair of damaged proteins, the relative increase in MPS was
no different across the resistance exercise training program.
Based on these data (24), it would therefore appear that the
initial increase in the rates of MPS during resistance exercise
training is predominantly directed toward the remodeling/
repair of damaged skeletal muscle protein, after which, MPS is
subsequently refined, and targeted toward muscle hypertrophy
(52). This thesis may also support our aforementioned asser-
tion that there is an initial upregulation of translational capacity
immediately following the onset of resistance exercise training
to support elevated protein turnover that is then attenuated with
more prolonged training (67).
Time Course of Muscle Hypertrophy with Resistance
Exercise Training
Skeletal muscle is in a positive state of protein balance
immediately following exercise when combined with protein
feeding (11, 12, 68). Therefore, technically speaking, muscle
hypertrophy, which we define as increases in the abundance of
contractile units, commences during this time. However, de-
spite the positive state of muscle protein balance after exercise
and feeding, changes in skeletal muscle fiber cross-sectional
area (CSA) assessed using histochemical staining are generally
not detectable until at least 6–7 wk of training (42) (Fig. 2).
One explanation for this disconnect between measurements of
protein balance and CSA could be that resistance exercise leads

translational capacity, whole muscle, and muscle fiber cross-sectional area
(CSA) in response to resistance exercise training. The overarching concept is
that initial increases in MPS are a biological response to support remodeling of
damaged muscle protein and eventually muscle hypertrophy. 1: The early stage
increases in MPS are sustained partly by concomitant elevated translational
capacity to support the remodeling of damaged structural and contractile
elements of the muscle proteome. 2: Then, after the attenuation of exercise-
induced muscle damage, there is a reduction in contribution of MPS to the
remodeling of proteins related to the structural and architectural apparatus
toward contractile muscle proteins. 3: After a period of time, the rates of MPS
are subsequently regulated by the adaptive increase in translational efficiency.
4: This results in a detectable increase in skeletal muscle size and mass. All of
these responses are deigned to support an expansion of the muscle protein pool,
i.e., single fiber CSA. A.U., arbitrary units.

 to increased myofibrillar density (0–6 wk) followed by a
delayed expansion of CSA. Indeed, the changes in the penna-
tion angle of various muscles that occur rapidly with resistance
exercise (14) training would allow a greater amount of con-
tractile units to be placed in series into a myofiber without
influencing muscle fiber CSA. However, as the myofibrils
account for ~80% of fiber CSA, it is unlikely that sufficient
changes in either the pennation angle or myofibrillar density
would occur unless they were to negatively influence metabolic
processes or myofilament interaction. It is more likely that the
inability to measure changes in fiber CSA until the latter stages
of resistance exercise training are attributed to a lack of
measurement accuracy and statistical power due to low partic-
ipant numbers. The latter point is particularly relevant when
considering the heterogeneity in the hypertrophic response to
training between subjects (22, 48), a factor highly dependent
on training status (1), dietary intake (62), and potentially
genetic predisposition (13). We acknowledge studies using
advanced ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging of
whole muscle CSA have reported significant increases in
muscle CSA in response to resistance exercise training within
2–3 wk of training onset (14, 28, 80). However, recent data
show that early increases in whole muscle CSA may largely be
accounted for by damage-induced muscle swelling (24–26). It is
also known that connective tissue mass may increase during
resistance exercise training confounding interpretation of these
data (14, 28, 80). Studies employing larger subject numbers may
improve detection limits, but we would posit that true skeletal
muscle fiber hypertrophy with resistance training is still unlikely
to be detectable until at least 5–6 wk of resistance training.
High-Intensity Interval Exercise and Muscle Protein
Turnover
Exercise is not only employed as a means to enhance athletic
performance but also to lower risk of chronic disease. While
resistance- and endurance-type exercise training confer inde-
pendent health benefits, other forms of exercise also have a
significant impact of muscle protein turnover. High-intensity
interval exercise (HIIE), used here to encompass both HIIE and
sprint interval exercise (SIE), is known to increase cardiore-
spiratory fitness (37, 86) and stimulate muscle mitochondrial
biogenesis (53, 74). The impact that HIIE has on muscle
ultrastructural protein remodeling and/or hypertrophy is, how-
ever, yet to be fully characterized. It has been shown that
myofibrillar MPS is elevated, although not to the same degree
as that observed following resistance exercise, at 24 and 48 h
following a bout of HIIE in untrained older men (8). Intrigu-
ingly, HIIE (and not resistance or aerobic exercise) was the
only exercise modality to stimulate an increase in sarcoplasmic
MPS, which the authors speculated was the result of increased
mitochondrial protein synthesis (8). Furthermore, while the
effect of SIE training on MPS was not specifically examined,
integrative mixed-muscle and cytosolic muscle protein synthe-
sis, with a trend for muscle mitochondrial protein synthesis,
was greater in men than women during 3 wk of SIE (74). While
these data do not necessarily indicate that MPS was increased
in response to SIE, increases in citrate synthase and PGC-1�
protein content in response to SIE training in both men and
women were suggestive of increased mitochondrial protein
synthesis during the period of SIE training (74). Taken together
the results of these two trials (8, 74) are indicative that HIIE
can stimulate MPS, particularly mitochondrial protein synthe-
sis and allude, at least in older men, to a role for HIIE training
to induce myofibrillar protein remodeling.
Despite an increase in myofibrillar MPS in response to acute
HIIE in older men, short-term (�6 wk) trials examining the
effect of HIIE on muscle fiber CSA have not found that HIIE
induces muscle hypertrophy (50, 51, 79). Joanisse et al. (51)
reported no increase in type I nor II muscle fiber CSA and no
expansion of the satellite cell pool in response to 6 wk of HIIE
training, which can result in muscle hypertrophy (66, 87).
Interestingly, despite no increase in satellite cell number, the
authors did report an increase in the number of differentiating
and terminally differentiating satellite cells following HIIE
training (51), which they proposed was indicative of a role of
satellite cells in muscle fiber remodeling. Furthermore, in
response to HIIE training there is an increase in the number of
satellite cells associated with hybrid muscle fibers (those ex-
pressing both myosin heavy chain I and II) as well as a greater
number of differentiating satellite cells and centrally located
nuclei associated with hybrid, compared with type I or II
muscle fibers. Such findings provide further experimental ev-
idence to support a role for HIIE to induce muscle fiber
remodeling (50). Given the absence of HIIE-induced muscle
hypertrophy following short-term training regimes, the in-
crease in myofibrillar MPS seen in exercise-naïve older men is
likely contributing to muscle fiber protein remodeling rather
than protein accretion. While we presume, as detailed above,
that increases in myofibrillar MPS early during HIIE training
are contributing to muscle fiber remodeling, to date no study
has examined the time course of the MPS response with HIIE
training. Nonetheless, before examining time-course changes
in MPS induced by HIIE, the effect of HIIE to increase
myofibrillar MPS needs to be confirmed in young individuals.
Furthermore, an examination of the longer-term (� 6 wk)
effects of HIIE on muscle fiber CSA would be informative.
The Role of Easily Releasable Myofilaments in Skeletal
Muscle Protein Turnover
As we have discussed, although acute gene and translational
responses to exercise are a fundamental part of the remodeling
process, there is often a poor correlation between the magni-
tude of these responses and actual rates of MPS (2, 58).

 Therefore, to gain a more accurate understanding of how
exercise influences skeletal muscle remodeling, researchers
often rely on direct measurements of MPS in conjunction with
readouts of translational and transcriptional control (20, 56).
However, the biological processes by which newly synthesized
myofibrillar proteins are incorporated into the functional myo-
fibrillar protein lattice still remain largely unknown. Studies in
animal models have alluded to the existence of a group of
myofilaments termed �easily releasable myofilaments� (23, 64).
This group of myofilaments appear to act as intermediates and
are readily released and degraded in response to disuse or
starvation to release amino acids for gluconeogenesis (7, 23,
64). If these fibers are readily released in times of atrophy, it is
conceivable that they also are rapidly constructed in times of
growth in humans. To our knowledge, there are no data relating
to exercise-induced changes in the turnover of these filaments
in human models of exercise training. It has been suggested
that following translation, easily releasable myofilaments are
constructed in the sarcoplasm then move (via an undefined
mechanism) to the lattice where they exchange with other
myofibrillar proteins (64). It is important to consider that the
spacing between the various elements of the myofibrillar lattice
can vary from 20 to 50 nm (9). Therefore, while small molec-
ular mass proteins such as troponin C (~7.5-nm long, ~2.5-nm
wide) (73) would have little problem navigating through the
lattice, the likelihood that larger proteins such as myosin
(~160- to 165-nm long), and titin (2,500–3,000 kDa, �1-�m
long) (49) would be capable of simply diffusing into the
preexisting protein lattice requires experimental corroboration.
More work in humans is now needed to identify the role(s) of
easily releasable myofilaments and how they respond to
changes in contractile activity. Such data may provide impor-
tant information for not only the examination of resistance
exercised-induced muscle growth but also the etiology of
muscle loss during periods of disease and muscle disuse.
Conclusion
By combining proof-of-principle studies in animals with
clinically relevant human work, in recent years our understand-
ing of the molecular and cellular processes by which exercise
alters skeletal muscle phenotype has been significantly ad-
vanced. Nevertheless, there are still a number of important
questions that remain unanswered. For instance, how acute
changes in gene expression and ribosomal proteins relate to
skeletal muscle growth is still unknown. Novel technological
developments such as the ability to assess the fractional syn-
thetic rate of individual muscle proteins (81, 82) in conjunction
with nonbiased microarray analysis of gene expression (56)
will no doubt provide critical information in this area. Another
important question that remains unanswered is exactly what are
the processes that regulate the deposition of newly synthesized
muscle proteins into the myofibrillar lattice following transla-
tion/termination and are these processes altered by age, sex,
and/or disease? Certainly existing studies in animal models of
research suggest a potential role for easily releasable myofila-
ments (23, 64), but more work is now needed in humans to
corroborate these interesting and potentially clinically relevant
data. Finally, there are a number of other factors such as
changes in miRNA activity (27, 96) that impact posttranscrip-
tional responses to exercise, leading to a fundamental discon-
nect between changes in gene expression and protein abun-
dance (89). Future studies that elucidate these processes also
promise to enhance our understanding regarding the role of
exercise in skeletal muscle biology.
