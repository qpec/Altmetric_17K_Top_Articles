If humans ever start to live permanently in space, assisted repro-
ductive technology using preserved spermatozoa will be impor-
tant for producing offspring; however, radiation on the International
Space Station (ISS) is more than 100 times stronger than that on
Earth, and irradiation causes DNA damage in cells and gametes.
Here we examined the effect of space radiation on freeze-dried
mouse spermatozoa held on the ISS for 9 mo at –95 °C, with launch
and recovery at room temperature. DNA damage to the sperma-
tozoa and male pronuclei was slightly increased, but the fertiliza-
tion and birth rates were similar to those of controls. Next-
generation sequencing showed only minor genomic differences
between offspring derived from space-preserved spermatozoa
and controls, and all offspring grew to adulthood and had normal
fertility. Thus, we demonstrate that although space radiation can
damage sperm DNA, it does not affect the production of viable
offspring after at least 9 mo of storage on the ISS.

S
ince the “space dog” Laika (Лайка) was first placed into
orbit in 1957 (1), many humans and animals have been to
space or stayed on the International Space Station (ISS) for
more than 6 mo. In the future, humans likely will live on large-
scale space stations or in other space habitats for several years or
even over many generations. At that time, assisted reproductive
technology (ART) likely will be used to produce humans in space
habitats, given that the use of ART by infertile couples has in-
creased year by year and that ART can be performed with cry-
opreserved spermatozoa or embryos (2, 3). In a similar way,
domestic animals likely will be generated by artificial insemina-
tion (AI) in space, because many domestic animals are already
produced by AI using long-term cryopreserved spermatozoa (4).
In addition, genetic diversity is very important for maintaining a
species, especially in small colonies, and this could be achieved
by cryopreserving a diverse range of gamete cells. The environ-
ment in space is very different from that on Earth, however,
including high levels of space radiation and microgravity, and the
effects of these factors on mammalian reproduction are largely
unknown. Although with current technology, producing offspring
in such an environment can be difficult or dangerous (5), the
study of reproduction in space is a very important subject for
our future.
So far, the effects of microgravity on early development have
been studied using sea urchins, fish, amphibians, and birds (6–
12). These studies have concluded that microgravity does not
prevent animal reproduction. However, because of the difficulty
in maintaining mammals and performing experiments in space,
studies of mammal reproduction in space have not progressed as
well as in other animals, and only a few papers have been pub-
lished (13–18). Those studies and our previous study (19) have
suggested that mammalian reproduction in space under condi-
tions of microgravity cannot be easily compared with reproduc-
tion in other species.
Another difference between space and Earth is the high level
of radiation in space. The doses received inside the ISS depend
on sunspot cycles and cosmic rays. The average dose rate mea-
sured at the ISS is ∼0.5 mSv/day, roughly 100-fold higher than
that measured on Earth (20). Ground-based studies have dem-
onstrated the deleterious effects of radiation on living organisms,
including the induction of mutations and tumor formation
(21, 22). Humans living for several generations in space habitats or
traveling to Mars will encounter much higher cosmic radiation,
possibly putting them at high risk for cancer (23). If space radia-
tion also causes DNA damage to cryopreserved spermatozoa, it
might lead to serious problems, such as embryo death or abortion,
or cause mutations in offspring and subsequent generations.
Salamander and medaka fish eggs could be fertilized and de-
veloped normally during orbital space flight (6, 24), suggesting
that space radiation from brief space flights does not affect fer-
tilization or later embryogenesis in these vertebrates. However,
mammalian oocytes are known to have a strong potential for
Significance
Radiation on the International Space Station (ISS) is more than
100 times stronger than at the Earth’s surface, and at levels
that can cause DNA damage in somatic cell nuclei. The damage
to offspring caused by this irradiation in germ cells has not
been examined, however. Here we preserved mouse sperma-
tozoa on the ISS for 9 mo. Although sperm DNA was slightly
damaged during space preservation, it could be repaired by the
oocyte cytoplasm and did not impair the birth rate or normality
of the offspring. Our results demonstrate that generating hu-
man or domestic animal offspring from space-preserved sper-
matozoa is a possibility, which should be useful when the
“space age” arrives.

 repairing damaged DNA (25–27), so when live animals are in
space for only short periods, the effect of space radiation might
be masked by subsequent repair of the damaged DNA after
fertilization. In contrast, although cryopreserved cells are still
alive, they have stopped metabolizing, which means that they
cannot repair DNA damage while still frozen (28, 29). There-
fore, DNA damage might accumulate with increased duration in
space. If this is so, then the production of offspring from long-
term cryopreserved spermatozoa in space will be compromised
because of increased embryo mortality or mutation rates in the
offspring. Therefore, it is very important to examine the effect of
space radiation on spermatozoa preserved in space. In addition,
the resistance of spermatozoa likely differs among species, be-
cause the sperm structure differs (30). Therefore, to examine the
influences of radiation in mammalian species, we must use
mammalian species, and the mouse is a very convenient model
animal for space study.
For the present study, we decided to freeze-dry the mouse
spermatozoa (31) rather than use traditional cryopreservation
methods. When spermatozoa are freeze-dried or evaporatively
dried, none of the sperm survive; however, mouse spermatozoa
can maintain the ability to generate offspring when added to
water and microinjected into fresh oocytes (31, 32), and this may
possible with human spermatozoa in the future (33, 34). More
importantly, such dried spermatozoa can be preserved at room
temperature for up to 2 y (35, 36) and in a freezer almost in-
definitely (37). In addition, the samples are very light and occupy
a small volume. Therefore, our samples could be launched to the
ISS without the need for a freezer, which greatly reduced the cost
of launching. The merits of this procedure, in terms of the ease of
launching freeze-dried samples into space, are significant for en-
abling the study of mammalian reproduction in space, even though
the production rate of offspring from freeze-dried spermatozoa is
lower than that from traditional cryopreservation methods.
After exposure to space radiation for 9 mo at –95 °C, the
samples were returned to Earth. We evaluated these samples for
sperm morphology and DNA damage, capacity for fertilization
by microinjection, in vitro developmental potential, and nor-
mality of offspring derived from the spermatozoa.
Results
Collection of Space Sperm Samples. The samples (Fig. 1 A and B)
were launched to the ISS on August 4, 2013, and returned to
ground on May 19, 2014. Therefore, these space sperm samples
were exposed to cosmic radiation for 288 d. The majority of the
glass ampules sustained no damage during the launch or return.
The ground control sperm samples from the same mice were
exposed to the same temperature changes at the same times and
for the same durations as the space sperm samples.
Total Doses of Space Radiation. The CR-39 plastic nuclear track
detectors (PNTDs) in the Bio PADLES packages collected from
the space-preserved cases (Fig. 1C) can detect nuclear tracks.

 of atomic nuclei produced during space flight. Background doses
measured in the ground control sperm sample case were sub-
tracted from the net doses measured during space flight. From
the results, the absorbed radiation dose rate was calculated as
0.41 ± 0.01 mGy/day, or a dose-equivalent rate of 0.62 ± 0.03
mSv/day, and the total absorbed dose was 117.24 ± 3.98 mGy in
water, or a total dose equivalent of 178.35 ± 7.27 mSv.
Morphology and DNA Damage in Spermatozoa. The morphology of
space sperm samples could not be distinguished from that of the
ground control samples, at least at the light microscopy level
(Figs. 1 E and F). Some spermatozoa showed breakage between
the head and tail or fragmented tails, but this is typical for freeze-
dried spermatozoa. However, measurement of the comet DNA
tails revealed significantly longer tails in the space sperm samples
compared with the ground control sperm samples in all mouse
strains except the C57BL/6 strain (Fig. 1 G–I and Table S1).
In Vitro Fertilization and DNA Damage in Male Pronuclei. When
samples were rehydrated, the spermatozoa were used for intra-
cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) of fresh oocytes within
1 h. Most of the oocytes were fertilized and formed normal-
appearing pronuclei irrespective of mouse strain, similar to the
results for the ground control sperm samples (Table 1). The two-
cell rates in this study were slightly lower than those obtained
using fresh spermatozoa (∼100% in our laboratory).
We next examined the DNA damage in male pronuclei. When
zygotes fertilized with space sperm samples were immunostained
with the anti–gamma-H2AX antibody, numerous foci were de-
tected in male pronuclei (Fig. 1 J–L). Given the difficulty in
counting the number of foci inside pronuclei, we measured the
brightness of the whole male pronucleus, which was then sub-
tracted from the brightness of the zygote cytoplasm. As shown in
Fig. 1L and Table S2, the brightness of the male pronuclei varied
among zygotes. Although on average, male pronuclei derived
from space sperm samples were slightly brighter than those from
ground control sperm samples, there were no statistically sig-
nificant differences between them in any mouse strain except
the BCF1 strain.
Developmental Potential in Vitro. To observe the developmental
potential of zygotes fertilized with space spermatozoa, some
zygotes were cultured in vitro until they developed to the blas-
tocyst stage at 4.5 d after ICSI. Most of the injected oocytes
fertilized normally, and some developed into blastocysts (Fig. 2
A–D). Some of these blastocysts were immunostained to evaluate
the quality based on the cell number and allocation of inner cell
mass (ICM) cells. The allocation of ICM cells did not show any
clear differences between ground control and space sperm
samples (Fig. 2 E and F). On the other hand, although the mean
number of ICM cells was similar in the space and ground control
samples (11 and 13, respectively), the mean number of tro-
phectoderm (TE) cells was lower in the space samples (35 vs. 55).
However, most of the embryos were used for embryo transfer, and
thus only six blastocysts from the space samples and three blas-
tocysts from the ground control samples were examined.
Full-Term Development and Normality of Offspring. The potential
for development to full term is the strongest evidence of the
normality of the DNA of the space sperm samples. Therefore,
when embryos reached the two-cell stage, some were transferred
into recipient females, and the birth rates were compared be-
tween the space and ground control sperm samples, as well as
between the freeze-dried spermatozoa and the original sperma-
tozoa (before preservation). As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2G,
the mean birth rates of offspring derived from space sperm
samples (“space pups”; Fig. 2H) and ground control sperm
samples were almost the same (8–17% and 7–15%, respectively)
but significantly lower than that with the original spermatozoa
(28–39%). The sex ratio of space pups (53% male, 47% female)
was within the normal range. After the pups grew to adulthood,
two or three pairs from all strains were selected at random and
mated with each other. All of these couples had offspring, clearly
demonstrating normal fertility.
Next-Generation Sequencing Analysis. Finally, we analyzed the
global gene expression profiles of pups derived from space and
ground control sperm samples to assess for any nonphenotypic
differences. Seven pups (four females, IDs S2, S4, S5, and S7, and
three males, IDs S1, S3, and S6) from space sperm samples and
six pups (one female, ID G1, and five males, IDs G2–G6) from
ground control sperm samples derived from the same male mouse
(C57BL/6N strain) were used, and freshly collected brains were
examined. From the results of heat mapping (Fig. 2I), although
the two sets appeared slightly dissimilar, the differences were not
statistically significant. There was also no significant difference in
gene expression profiles between male and female offspring.
Discussion
In this study, freeze-dried mouse spermatozoa were held on the
ISS for 9 mo at –95 °C and then examined after exposure to space
radiation.
During the study period, irradiation from space to the sample
case was 0.4 mGy/day, or 0.6 mSv/day, which is typical for the ISS
and ∼100 times higher than that on Earth (29). No special events
occurred in the local space during the study period. In these

the same times and for the same durations as when launching and storing the sample case, a control sample case was exposed to room temperature, then
frozen at –95 °C and stored in a freezer at the Tsukuba Space Center in Japan. These are referred to as ground control sperm samples. Space: Samples were

 conditions, our samples were preserved for 288 d and received a
total irradiation dose of 117 mGy, or 178 mSv. Previous ground-
based studies have suggested that sperm DNA damage occurs
when live mice are irradiated with >400 mGy (38, 39), or more
than twice the irradiation dose of our samples. Therefore, in
theory, sperm DNA damage after only 9 mo in space will not be
that obvious. However, in this study, although the space sperm
samples did not show changes in morphology or decreased fer-
tilization rates after ICSI, the DNA damage in the space sperm
samples, as determined by the comet assay and gamma-H2AX
immunostaining, was slightly increased compared with the ground
control samples, irrespective of mouse strain. Previous space
studies have shown that frozen human lymphoblastoid cells
launched and preserved for 134 d in a freezer on the ISS sus-
tained more damage to nuclei than the theoretical damage from
the predicted dosage of radiation (28, 29); therefore, it is likely
that the DNA damage caused by space radiation accumulated
in the sperm nuclei until they were returned to Earth. Another
possible explanation lies in the difference between artificial ra-
diation in ground-based studies and actual space radiation. When
fruit flies were launched into space on the Space Shuttle, al-
though the flight duration was only 8 d, the frequencies of sex-
linked recessive lethal mutations were 2- to 3-fold greater in these
flies compared with the ground-based controls (40). That report
suggested that the frequency of DNA damage will increase when
biological samples are exposed to real space radiation. Taken
together, the foregoing findings suggest that when frozen or
freeze-dried spermatozoa are preserved in space, DNA damage
from space radiation will be greater than that in samples held on
Earth, even over short periods.
Importantly, the birth rate of offspring from the space sperm
samples did not decrease compared with that from ground
control sperm samples, even with the apparent increase in DNA
damage to the nuclei during space flight. The comet assay on
single spermatozoa revealed DNA damage in many spermatozoa.
In contrast, with gamma-H2AX immunostaining of individual
male pronuclei derived from space sperm samples, although the
mean level of DNA damage was slightly higher than that in con-
trols, the difference was smaller than that seen with the comet
assay, and there were no significant differences in any strain except
the BCF1 strain. Why only the BCF1 strain was significantly dif-
ferent is not clear, but the difference was not great, and some of
the male pronuclei in this study did not show any DNA damage.
Thus, it appears that sperm DNA damage was decreased or
repaired after fertilization.
Our whole genome analysis also showed that the offspring
derived from space sperm samples were similar to the offspring
derived from the ground control sperm samples. It is well known
that oocytes and zygotes have a strong DNA repair capacity (25–
27); therefore, it is likely that any DNA damage in the space-
preserved sperm nuclei was repaired after fertilization and thus
had no ultimate effect on the birth rate of offspring. If this is so,
then the DNA repair capacity in the oocyte cytoplasm needs to
be quantified to evaluate the possibility of applying ART or AI
to human or domestic animals in space habitats using long-term
cryopreserved spermatozoa. In current ground-based AI proce-
dures, sperm samples are often cryopreserved for more than

 10 y; however, we found increased DNA damage in spermatozoa
after only 9 mo in space. If sperm samples are to be preserved for
longer periods in space, then it is likely that DNA damage will
increase and exceed the limit of the oocyte’s capacity for repair.
Testing this will require more extensive sperm preservation ex-
periments in space. If the DNA damage occurring during long-
term preservation is found to have a significant effect on offspring,
we will need to develop methods to protect sperm samples against
space radiation, such as with an ice shield, to enable future animal
breeding in this environment.
In addition, sperm preservation in the event of disasters on
Earth will be an important tool for maintaining the genetic di-
versity of mammalian species, much like plant seed preservation
in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. Although current sperm
drying methods can maintain nuclear integrity for only a limited
number of years at ambient temperature, this time eventually will
be extended. Reliability likely will be obtained before the be-
ginning of the “Space Age,” given that preservation periods have
already been extended from a few months (31) to 2 y (36) by
improving the drying method. In addition, drying conditions
might be better than traditional cryopreservation for long-term
preservation, because tardigrades can survive in extreme envi-
ronments, such as space, only in a dehydrated state of dormancy
(41). Once the reliability and integrity of space-preserved sper-
matozoa can be demonstrated, underground storage on the Moon,
such as in lava tubes (42), could be among the best places for
prolonged or permanent sperm preservation because of their very
low temperatures, protection from space radiation by thick bedrock
layers, and complete isolation from any disasters on Earth.
Methods
Animals. C56BL/6N, BDF1 (C57BL/6 × DBA/2), BCF1 (C57BL/6 × C3H/He), and
129B6F1 male mice carrying the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene (GFP-
tg-129/Sv × GFP-tg-C57BL/6), aged 3 mo, were used to collect spermatozoa.
The C57BL/6N, BDF1, and BCF1 mice were purchased from Shizuoka Labo-
ratory Animal Center, and the 129B6F1 mice were bred in our mouse facility.
The C57BL/6N and BDF1 mice, age 8–10 wk, were used to produce oocytes.
The surrogate pseudopregnant females used as embryo transfer recipients
were ICR strain mice mated with vasectomized males of the same strain. On
the day of the experiments, or after completion of all experiments, the mice
were euthanized by CO2 inhalation or by cervical dislocation. All animal
experiments were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of
Health’s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved
by the Institutional Committee of Laboratory Animal Experimentation of the
RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology and by the Institutional Committee
of Laboratory Animal Experimentation of the University of Yamanashi.
Preparation of Freeze-Dried Spermatozoa. Both epididymides were collected
from male mice, and the ducts were cut with sharp scissors. A few drops of the
dense sperm mass were placed into a centrifuge tube with 2 mL of CZB
medium (43), followed by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After
sperm concentration measurements, 50-μL aliquots of the sperm suspension
were divided into 30 glass ampules. These ampules were frozen using liquid
nitrogen and then freeze-dried (EYELA FDU-2200; Tokyo Rikakikai and
FreeZone; Labconco). The cock of the freeze-drying machine was opened for
at least 3 h until the samples were completely dry. After drying, the ampules
were sealed by melting the necks using a gas burner under vacuum condi-
tions, then kept in a –30 °C freezer until use.
Sperm samples were prepared from 70 male mice of four different strains.
The quality of each lot was checked by examining its fertility (see below) using
one or two ampules from each mouse. From these results, we selected samples
from 12 mice: three from the C57BL/6 strain, four from the BDF1 strain, three
from the BCF1 strain, and two from the 129B6F1 strain expressing GFP. These
ampules and their data are referred to as the “original sperm” samples. Each
ampule was wrapped in polyimide film and then the ampules were further
wrapped in groups of four (Fig. 1 A and B). All ampules from 12 male mice
(total of 48 ampules) were placed into small cases for space preservation (Fig.
1C) or as a ground control.
Launch to the ISS and Return to Earth. The sample cases, including the Bio
PADLES radiation monitors (Fig. 1C), were launched aboard the H-II Transfer
Vehicle KOUNOTORI 4 on August 4, 2013, at room temperature. After arrival
at the ISS, astronauts stored them in a –95 °C freezer on August 10, 2013.
Nine months later (on May 19, 2014), the sample case was retrieved from the
freezer and then returned to Earth on the SpaceX-3 vehicle at ambient
temperature. Therefore, these space sperm samples were exposed to cosmic
radiation for 288 d. On May 21, 2014, the sample case was delivered to NASA
and placed into a –80 °C freezer. This was then transported to our labora-
tory. These samples are designated the space sperm samples.
At the same times and for the same durations as the launching and storing
of the sample case, a control sample case was exposed to room temperature,
then frozen at –95 °C and stored in a freezer at the Tsukuba Space Center in
Japan. These are designated the ground control sperm samples.
Space Radiation Dosimetry. Bio PADLES (TLD/CR39) monitoring devices
(Fukuvi Chemical Industry) were used to measure radiation dosages. These
include CR-39 PNTDs. The devices were placed inside the cases (Fig. 1C) of
space and ground control sperm samples. After the sample cases were re-
covered, the analysis was initiated on June 2, 2014. Pictures of radiation-
etched pits reflecting the tracks of atomic nuclei accumulated during space
flight (Fig. 1D) were used to calculate the total radiation dose (44).
Analysis and Scoring of Comet Slides. The single-cell gel electrophoresis
technique (i.e., the comet assay) measures DNA damage, including double-
and single-strand breaks (45). Here comet assays to detect sperm DNA damage
were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Trevigen). In brief,
sperm specimens were collected from ampules immediately after opening and
then rehydrated in water. Space and ground control sperm samples derived
from the same male mouse were mounted on six slides, and 100–300 sperm
heads were analyzed following electrophoresis. In some cases, spermatozoa
had aggregated and were difficult to measure. To standardize the results
among the different mouse strains, the length of each DNA comet “tail” was
divided by the mean length of the ground control results in each strain.
Immunostaining of Zygotes. In histone H2AX, an H2A variants, the serine at
position 139 is rapidly phosphorylated within minutes after DNA damage.
The phosphorylated form of H2AX, designated gamma-H2AX, forms foci at
the sites of DNA damage, which then serve as platforms to recruit various
repair and cell cycle checkpoint proteins (46). Therefore, gamma-H2AX foci
formation was used as a marker of DNA double-strand breaks in male and
female pronuclei, and histone H3K9me2 signals were used to distinguish
female pronuclei. The primary antibodies used were an anti–phospho-H2AX
(Ser139) rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:500; Millipore Merck) and an anti-histone
H3 (dimethyl K9) mouse monoclonal antibody (1:500; Abcam). The secondary
antibodies used were Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500;
Molecular Probes) and Alexa Fluor 568-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500 di-
lution; Molecular Probes). DNA was stained with DAPI (2 μg/mL; Molecular
Probes). The brightness of whole male pronuclei was measured using ImageJ
and then subtracted from the brightness of the zygote cytoplasm.
ICSI and Embryo Transfer. To generate offspring from preserved spermatozoa,
oocytes were collected from C57BL/6N or BDF1 female mice. Most experi-
ments used BDF1 oocytes irrespective of the male mouse strain. Only when
next-generation sequencing was performed for genomic analysis were
C57BL/6 oocytes were used for C57BL/6 male mouse ICSI to generate pure
inbred offspring. When ampules were opened, 50 μL of water was imme-
diately added to rehydrate the sperm samples, and ICSI was initiated using
four or five micromanipulators as described previously (47).
At 0.5 d postcoitum (dpc), embryos were transferred into the oviducts of
pseudopregnant ICR strain female mice that had been mated with a vasec-
tomized male the night before transfer. At 18.5–19.5 dpc, the offspring were
delivered by caesarean section. Some embryos were cultured in 5% CO2 in
air for 5 d in CZB medium at 37 °C to examine their in vitro developmental
potential and the quality of blastocysts.
Immunostaining of Blastocysts. To evaluate the quality of blastocysts derived
from space sperm samples, immunofluorescence staining of blastocysts was
performed as described previously (48). The primary antibodies used were an
anti-CDX2 mouse monoclonal antibody (1:200; BioGenex) to detect TE cells
and an anti-Oct3/4 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:500; MBL) to detect ICM
cells. The secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-
mouse IgG (1:500; Molecular Probes) and Alexa Fluor 564-labeled goat anti-
rabbit IgG (1:500; Molecular Probes). DNA was stained with DAPI (2 μg/mL;
Molecular Probes).
RNA Isolation and RNA Sequencing. In this study, both space and ground
control sperm samples were obtained from the same male C57BL/6N mouse

 strain, and fresh oocytes were collected from C57BL/6N female mice. Therefore,
the offspring were of a pure C57BL/6N strain. At 18.5 dpc, fetuses were collected
by cesarean section. Several organs from seven pups (four females, neonate IDs
S2, S3, S4, S7, and three males, neonate IDs S1, S3, S6) from space sperm samples
and six pups (one female, neonate ID G1; and five males, neonate IDs G2–G5)
from ground control sperm samples were collected, immediately frozen in
liquid nitrogen, and kept at –30 °C until use. Brain tissues were used for further
analysis. Total RNA was purified using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The library for RNA sequencing
(RNA-seq) studies was prepared using the Kapa Stranded RNA/mRNA-Seq Kit
(Illumina). The RNA-seq library was sequenced for 36-base single-end RNAs
using an Illumina GAIIx machine with a TruSeq SBS kit v5–GA kit (Illumina). The
resulting sequence data were mapped against the mouse reference genome
sequence (GRCm38/mm10) using bowtie2 (49), followed by calculation of the
reads per kilobase of exon per million mapped reads (RPKM) value for each
gene using the Bioconductor package DEGseq (50). Clustering analysis and
principal component analysis were performed with Cluster 3.0 (51).
Statistical Analysis. The comet DNA breakage assay results were evaluated
using the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney nonparametric test, the gamma-H2AX
assay results were evaluated using the Student t test, and the birth rate was
evaluated using the χ2 test. RNA-seq analyses were evaluated using the
Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney nonparametric test adjusted for a false discovery
rate, and differentially expressed genes between space and control pups
were statistically analyzed using the DESeq2 package (52) with the raw se-
quence reads count. P < 0.05 (birth rate and gamma-H2AX staining) or P <
0.01 (others) was considered statistically significant.
