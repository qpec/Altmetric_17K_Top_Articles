ABSTRACT
Rationale Exposure to ambient air pollutants has been
associated with increased lung cancer incidence and
mortality, but due to the high case fatality rate, little is
known about the impacts of air pollution exposures on
survival after diagnosis. This study aimed to determine
whether ambient air pollutant exposures are associated
with the survival of patients with lung cancer.
Methods Participants were 352 053 patients with
newly diagnosed lung cancer during 1988–2009 in
California, ascertained by the California Cancer Registry.
Average residential ambient air pollutant concentrations
were estimated for each participant’s follow-up period.
Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate
HRs relating air pollutant exposures to all-cause mortality
overall and stratified by stage (localised only, regional
and distant site) and histology (squamous cell
carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, small cell carcinoma, large
cell carcinoma and others) at diagnosis, adjusting for
potential individual and area-level confounders.
Results Adjusting for histology and other potential
confounders, the HRs associated with 1 SD increases in
NO2, O3, PM10, PM2.5 for patients with localised stage
at diagnosis were 1.30 (95% CI 1.28 to 1.32), 1.04
(95% CI 1.02 to 1.05), 1.26 (95% CI 1.25 to 1.28) and
1.38 (95% CI 1.35 to 1.41), respectively. Adjusted HRs
were smaller in later stages and varied by histological
type within stage (p<0.01, except O3). The largest
associations were for patients with early-stage non-small
cell cancers, particularly adenocarcinomas.
Conclusions These epidemiological findings support
the hypothesis that air pollution exposures after lung
cancer diagnosis shorten survival. Future studies should
evaluate the impacts of exposure reduction.
INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer has been the most common cancer for
decades. W
orldwide, lung cancer causes nearly one
in five cancer deaths, about 1.59 million deaths
annually
(http://globocan.iarc.fr).
This
heavy
burden is largely a result of a high prevalence of
cigarette smoking, the leading cause of lung cancer;
advanced stage at diagnosis; and poor survival,
especially
among
those
with
advanced
stage
disease.1 2 Accordingly, interventions have focused
on the reduction of tobacco use, early-stage diagno-
sis and improved treatment. Although progress has
been made in each area, lung cancer survival
remains stubbornly poor, suggesting that novel
approaches are needed.3–6 A promising approach is
identifying and intervening on modifiable determi-
nants of survival; however, little research attention
has been directed to determinants beyond smoking.
One modifiable determinant of emerging interest is
ambient air pollution,7 which was recently classi-
fied as carcinogenic by the International Agency for
Research on Cancer (IARC).8
A
growing
body
of
evidence
indicates
that
ambient air pollutants are associated with lung
cancer incidence and mortality.9–12 However, rela-
tively little is known about air pollution effects on
survival after any cancer diagnosis.13 14 W
e rea-
soned that if ambient air pollution is a carcinogen
affecting lung cancer development, then inhaled
pollutants
may
also
drive
tumour
progression
through the same mechanistic pathways to shorten
survival after diagnosis. If ambient air pollution
increases both the incidence of lung cancer and
shortens survival after diagnosis, then it could have
a larger contribution to lung cancer mortality than
previously understood.
To determine whether ambient air pollutants are
associated with survival in patients with lung
cancer, we conducted a population-based cohort
study of 352 053 California residents with lung
cancer newly diagnosed in 1988–2009. W
e esti-
mated average residential exposures to nitrogen
dioxide, ozone and particulate matter air pollutants
from diagnosis to end of follow-up and related
these exposures to all-cause mortality and lung
cancer-specific mortality by stage and tumour hist-
ology at diagnosis.
Key messages
What is the key question?
▸ Does exposure to ambient air pollution after
diagnosis of lung cancer affect survival?
What is the bottom line?
▸ Patients with lung cancer, with higher average
ambient NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 exposures since
diagnosis, had shorter survival, with the largest
differences in survival for patients with
early-stage non-small cell cancers (particularly
adenocarcinomas).
Why read on?
▸ This is the first study to link individual-level
estimates of air pollution exposures after lung
cancer diagnosis to survival, and the study
population was the population-based sample of
352 053 patients with newly diagnosed lung
cancer during 1988–2009 in California, as
ascertained by the California Cancer Registry.

 METHODS
Lung cancer cases and individual-level data
Our study population included lung cancer cases (ICD-O-3 site
code C34) diagnosed in 1988–2009 and registered by the
California Cancer Registry (CCR), the statewide population-
based cancer surveillance system (http://www.ccrcal.org). The
CCR has collected information on all newly diagnosed cancers
(except non-melanoma skin cancer) in California since 1988
and has received the highest level of data quality certification
from the North American Association of Central Cancer
Registries.15 The CCR gathers individual-level data on demo-
graphics (age, sex, marital status, race/ethnicity), date of diagno-
sis, tumour characteristics at diagnosis (stage, anatomical site,
histology), treatment occurring <6 months after diagnosis and
patients’ vital status (date of death or date last known alive).
The CCR routinely updates patients’ vital status by linking to
the electronic death certificate master file from the California
Department of Public Health, recording the underlying cause of
death for deceased patients, as defined by the Department of
Health Services. After excluding patients with diagnoses of in
situ cancer (N=305) and non-carcinoma histology (N=20 964),
there were 352 053 cases remaining for analysis with complete
information on follow-up, date of birth, date of diagnosis and
race/ethnicity. W
e created standard histology groupings16 using
ICD-O-3 morphology codes for carcinoma (8010–8576): squa-
mous cell carcinoma (8050–8078, 8083–8084), adenocarcin-
oma (8140, 8211, 8230–8231, 8250–8260, 8323, 8480–8490,
8550–8551, 8570–8574, 8576), small cell carcinoma (8041–
8045, 8246), large cell—includes giant cell, clear cell and large
cell
undifferentiated—carcinoma
(8010–8012,
8014–8031,
8035, 8310) and other carcinomas (remaining codes).
No patient contact was conducted for this analysis; so, indi-
vidual patient-informed consent was not required. The CCR
operates under the annual review of the State of California
Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects (ie, Institutional
Review Board), which provided approval for this analysis.
Geocoding
W
e geocoded residential addresses at the date of diagnosis using
the
T
exas
A&M
geocoding
service
(geoservices.tamu.edu).
Details of the process, used by cancer registries throughout the
USA, are provided elsewhere.17 Briefly, address records were
geocoded to the centroid of the smallest resolvable area based
on the address completeness, ranging from tax assessor parcels
to state centroid when no address information was available (in
<0.1% of cases). In previous work, this method substantially
improved spatial resolution.18
Area-level covariates
Area-level covariates were assigned to each patient using the geo-
codes. Rural–urban commuting area (RUCA) codes, based on data
from the 2000 decennial census, classify census tracts into ordinal
ranks (1–10, from metropolitan to rural) based on the size and dir-
ection of primary commuting flows, using measures of population
density, urbanisation and daily commuting (http://www.ers.usda.
gov/data-products/rural-urban-commuting-area-codes.aspx).
Education index was defined as the average years of schooling in
the patient’s census tract based on a weighted sum of the distribu-
tion of years of schooling.19 Socioeconomic status, at the patient’s
census block group, was calculated using validated area-level mea-
sures from multiple census years.20
Air pollution exposure assignments
California air pollutant data were obtained from the US
Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Air Quality System
(AQS) database.21 Data were available for nitrogen dioxide
(NO2, ppb), ozone (O3, ppb), particulate matter with diameter
<10 μm (PM10, mg/m3) and 2.5 μm (PM2.5, mg/m3). Hourly
measurements were summarised as 24-hour averages for NO2,
PM10 and PM2.5 and average 8 hour daily maximum for O3.
Monthly average concentrations were spatially interpolated to
residence locations from up to four closest air quality monitor-
ing stations within a 50 km radius using the well-established
method of inverse distance weighting,22 23 with the decay par-
ameter equal to the inverse of the square of the distance of the
residence from each monitoring site. Interpolation performance
is summarised in online supplementary eTable 1. W
e excluded
exposure assignments when the nearest monitor was located
>25 km away or a geocode match was unavailable. Residential
ambient air pollution exposure assignments were calculated as
the average of the patient-level interpolated monthly concentra-
tions from the date of diagnosis to the date of last follow-up or
death. PM2.5 exposure assignments were only available for
patients diagnosed in 1998 and later, because routine monitor-
ing did not start until 1998. Our primary goal was to evaluate
associations with large-scale regional variation in ambient pollu-
tants; so, to account for potential confounding by local traffic,
we calculated and adjusted for the distance from residential
address to primary interstate highways and primary US and state
highways.
Outcome
Survival time was calculated from the date of newly diagnosed
lung cancer to the date of death from any cause (all-cause mor-
tality). For sensitivity analysis, we assessed time to death from
an underlying cause of lung cancer (ICD-9 code 1629 for
1988–1998 deaths and ICD-10 code C349 deaths after 1998).
The last day of follow-up was 31 December 2011.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated for survival, air pollution
exposures and other covariates. Median survival and 5-year sur-
vival rates were calculated after stratifying patients by the stage
at diagnosis and categorised air pollution exposures (cut-offs:
25th and 75th percentiles, and average of the two). Cox propor-
tional hazards models were used to model time to all-cause mor-
tality, allowing for right censoring due to loss to follow-up (or
study end) or, in the case of time to lung cancer mortality, cen-
soring due to death from another underlying cause. Preliminary
analyses determined that the following potential confounding
variables were predictors of mortality; so, all models adjusted
for age, sex, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, Hispanic,
non-Hispanic black, other/unknown), marital status (single,
married, formerly married, unknown), education index (quar-
tiles), socioeconomic status (quintiles), dichotomised rural–
urban community area (metropolitan core (1), non-metropolitan
core (>1)), categorised distance to primary interstate highway
(<300 m, 300–1500 m, >1500 m, missing), categorised dis-
tance to primary US and state highways (<300 m, 300–1500 m,
>1500 m, missing), categorised year of diagnosis (1988–1992,
1993–1997, 1998–2002, 2003–2009), calendar month of diag-
nosis and initial treatment (surgery, radiation and/or chemother-
apy vs none).
Single pollutant models were used to estimate HRs associated
with a 1 SD increase in continuous air pollution exposure, after

adjusted for stage and histology at diagnosis. W
e then evaluated
evidence for modification of air pollution associations by stage
and then by histology. Final single pollutant models were fit sep-
arately for each stage and histology. Sensitivity analyses were
performed by further stratifying stage-specific models (adjusted
for histology) by sex, race/ethnicity, year of diagnosis, metropol-
itan core group and large urban areas (Los Angeles County, Bay
Area Counties and San Diego County).

with a 0.05 type I error rate.
RESULTS
Characteristics of the study participants are presented in table 1.
Patients were on average 69.3 years old at diagnosis, predomin-
antly non-Hispanic white (77.2%), and most of them lived in a
metropolitan core (85.7%). More than half of lung cancers
were diagnosed at an advanced stage (53.0% distant site).
During the study period, there were 324 266 deaths (92.1% of
352 053 patients). Of these deaths, 78.3% were assigned an
underlying cause of lung cancer. Median survival times for loca-
lised, regional and distant site diagnoses were 3.6, 1.3 and
0.4 years, respectively. For patients with localised stage at diag-
nosis, median survival was shortest for patients with small and
large cell carcinomas (1.5 and 1.6 years, respectively) and
longest for patients with adenocarcinoma (5.1 years). The
number of patients with ‘unknown’ stage at diagnosis decreased
from 12 573 in 1988–1992 (5-year period) to 4399 in 2003–
2009 (7-year period), likely due to changes in technology,
medical practice and/or coding practices. The highest quality
geocode match (street address) was obtained for 91.1% of
patients.
Average air pollution exposure assignments (average from
diagnosis to end of follow-up for each patient ≤25 km from a
monitor) across patients were 21.9 ppb for NO2, 40.2 ppb for
O3, 31.8 mg/m3 for PM10 and 13.7 mg/m3 for PM2.5 (table 2).
As expected, PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 were more highly corre-
lated (Pearson’s R=0.70–0.76) than O3 and PM10 (R=0.36),
O3 and NO2 (R=−0.01) or O3 and PM2.5 (R=−0.02). Over the
study period, there were long-term downward trends in NO2,
PM10 and PM2.5 in California (see online supplementary
eFigure 1 and eTable 2). Only 8.7% of patients lived <300 m
from a primary interstate highway, while 45.4% lived >1500 m
(see online supplementary eTable 3).
W
e observed a pattern of shorter median survival and lower
5-year survival for patients with local or regional stage at diag-
nosis who had higher categorised NO2, PM10 or PM2.5 expo-
sures (table 3). For example, median survival for patients with
local stage at diagnosis was 2.4 years for those with high PM2.5
exposure (≥16 μg/m3) and 5.7 years for those with low PM2.5
exposure (<10 μg/m3). Survival for patients with distant stage at
diagnosis was poor and showed little variation with air pollution
exposure.
After adjusting for important determinants of survival and
potential confounders (including stage and histology), the HRs
for all-cause mortality associated with a 1 SD increase in each
pollutant were 1.13 (95% CI 1.12 to 1.13) for NO2, 1.02 (95%
CI 1.02 to 1.03) for O3, 1.11 (95% CI 1.11 to 1.12) for PM10
and 1.16 (95% CI 1.16 to 1.17) for PM2.5 (see online supple-
mentary eTable 4). As shown in table 4, these associations
varied by stage at diagnosis (all interaction p<0.01) and were of
similar magnitude whether considering all-cause mortality or

 lung cancer-specific mortality. For each pollutant, adjusted HRs
were larger for patients diagnosed at early stages. After stratify-
ing by stage, we found additional variation in the associations
by histology (all interaction p<0.01, except O3). After stratify-
ing by stage and histology, exposure to NO2, PM10 and PM2.5
remained strongly associated with all-cause mortality, with the
largest magnitude-adjusted HR for local stage (figure 1). The
adjusted HRs for NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 were generally smaller
for patients with small cell carcinoma and larger for patients
with adenocarcinoma (eg, local stage HR for PM10: 1.16 (95%
CI 1.11 to 1.21) vs 1.30 (95% CI 1.28 to 1.33), respectively).
O3 was not statistically significantly associated with all-cause
mortality for patients with small and large cell cancer, but was
modestly associated for patients with squamous cell carcinoma
and adenocarcinoma (local stage adjusted HR of 1.04 (95% CI
1.02 to 1.07) and 1.03 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.05), respectively).
Dose–response associations were evaluated in adjusted Cox
models with categorised air pollution exposures, stratified by
stage (data not shown). Results were qualitatively similar to the
unadjusted associations in table 3.
In sensitivity analyses, no substantial heterogeneity in stage-
specific adjusted HR was found by sex, race/ethnicity or distance
to air quality monitors (see online supplementary eTables 5a, b).
There was modest heterogeneity by year of diagnosis, particu-
larly for NO2 and PM10, but the patterns of larger HR for
patients diagnosed at earlier stages remained consistent. Patients
with local stage at diagnosis living in a metropolitan core had
slightly higher HR for PM10 and PM2.5 than those living in
non-metropolitan core areas (eg, PM2.5 HR of 1.40 vs 1.25), a
pattern that was also observed in the subsets of patients
diagnosed in Los Angeles County, the San Francisco Bay area or
San Diego County. These findings merit further study.
DISCUSSION
While ambient air pollutants have been associated with lung
cancer incidence and mortality,7 9–11 their impacts on survival
after diagnosis have yet to be fully assessed.14 In a population-
based study of 352 053 patients with newly diagnosed lung
cancer in California, we observed reduced survival associated
with higher average NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 exposure over the
follow-up period after diagnosis. HRs associated with these pol-
lutants were largest for early-stage cancers and varied by hist-
ology, with the largest HR in early-stage non-small cell cancers,
particularly adenocarcinoma.
A growing number of large cohort studies have found evidence
for associations between air pollution exposures and lung cancer
mortality using either incident lung cancer or death from lung
cancer.9–12 Meta-analysis estimates of the relative risk of lung
cancer incidence/death (not stratified by stage) were slightly
smaller than those observed in our study (1.04 (95% CI 1.01 to
1.08) for a 10 ppb increase in NO2,11 1.08 (95% CI 1.00 to
1.17) for a 10 mg/m3 increase in PM10
10 and 1.04 (95% CI 1.02
to 1.07) for a 5 mg/m3 increase in PM2.5) and showed some
evidence for heterogeneity by histology.10 For the two most
common histologies, relative risks associated with a 5 mg/m3
increase in PM2.5 were 1.18 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.35) for adenocar-
cinoma and 1.05 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.31) for squamous cell
carcinoma.10
Few studies have attempted to disentangle determinants of
lung cancer incidence from determinants of lung cancer survival
due to the high case fatality rate.10 24 To our knowledge, only
one study has related air pollution exposures to survival in
patients diagnosed with lung cancer.14 Xu et al14 studied white
patients with respiratory cancer in Honolulu and Los Angeles
between 1992–2008 and found adjusted HR slightly larger than
that we observed for all-cause mortality (1.48 (95% CI 1.44 to
1.52) for a 10 mg/m3 increase in PM10; 1.57 (95% CI 1.53
to 1.61) for a 5 mg/m3 increase in PM2.5; 1.04 (95% CI 1.03 to
1.06) for a 10 ppb change in O3) and slightly larger PM associa-
tions when restricting the analysis to Los Angeles cases only. Key
differences include that we interpolated ambient exposures to
residence locations (rather than using county-level exposures)
and that we considered only lung cancer cases stratified by stage
and histology. Xu et al considered all respiratory cancer cases and
adjusted for primary cancer site and stage. By fully conditioning
on disease type and severity at diagnosis, we more effectively
target inference about air pollution exposure associations with
survival after diagnosis by limiting carryover effects from differ-
ences at diagnosis potentially caused by earlier air pollution
exposures.
Our observed associations were clinically significant (≤38%
increased risk of death depending on stage and pollutant), sug-
gesting that reductions in exposure have the potential to improve
lung cancer survival. As expected, we observed a substantially
larger association with survival in local compared with distant
stage at diagnosis. As lung cancer screening becomes widely
implemented, a shift to diagnosis at earlier stages is likely to
occur. This is the stage at which air pollutants appear to have the
most impact on survival. To maximise the effectiveness of lung
cancer screening, interventions targeting modifiable determinants
of survival for early-stage diagnoses are needed. Our findings
suggest that future work should investigate the impact of inter-
ventions to reduce air pollution exposures (eg, avoidance, reloca-
tion, home filtration systems) on lung cancer survival.

 The pathophysiological mechanism underlying the relation-
ship between NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 and lung cancer survival is
uncertain. Ambient air pollution has been classified as a carcino-
gen and therefore may affect cancer progression after diagnosis
via the same well-described pathways including oxidative stress,
DNA damage, cell proliferation or epigenetic modifications. W
e
observed some of the largest air pollution HRs for adenocarcin-
oma, the only common histological subtype of lung cancer that
develops in a significant number of non-smokers.25 26 More
generally, air pollution may reduce survival in the susceptible
subpopulation of patients with cancer, for example, by impair-
ing respiratory function.
Strengths of our study include the population-based, large
sample size drawn from all cases diagnosed in California, mini-
mising selection bias and avoiding the survivorship bias in stand-
ard cohort studies. Using standardised methods, the CCR
collects detailed clinical data and individual-level information
on important determinants of survival (histology, stage, age and
year of diagnosis; first course of treatment, sex, race/ethnicity
and marital status). Our study focused on California, which has
one of the most extensive and longest running air quality moni-
toring networks in the USA.
Several limitations of our study should be considered. The
CCR collects information only on first course treatments, but
residual confounding by subsequent treatments is unlikely since
treatment is determined primarily by stage at diagnosis, and we
stratify by stage. Follow-up in the CCR is passive, but nearly
complete (>95%) for cancers with short survival. Individualised
residential ambient air pollution exposure assignments offer a
refinement over area-level exposure assignments (eg, reducing
spatial exposure misclassification, which can attenuate associa-
tions),10 27 28 but are subject to standard limitations, including
inability to account for individual behaviour (eg, patients with
cancer may spend even more time indoors than the general
population), changes of residence or potentially long periods of
time at medical facilities located in an area with different air
pollution levels. W
e focused on air pollution exposures with
large-scale regional variability using spatial interpolation of air
quality monitoring data, which does not capture the effects of
traffic-related pollution (TRP) that varies over a finer spatial
scale. W
e accounted for potential confounding by a crude
measure of local traffic (distance to highways). Future investiga-
tion of the effects of TRP on lung cancer survival requires the
development of high spatially resolved TRP exposure metrics
(eg, using land-use regression or line-source dispersion models)
to directly evaluate TRP associations. The air pollution monitor-
ing network is less dense in rural areas; so, exclusion of patients
living >25 km from a monitor differentially excludes patients in
rural areas. Long-term downward trends in NO2, PM10 and
PM2.5 in California during the study period have been recog-
nised previously.29 The lack of consistent long-term temporal
trend for O3 likely reduced the variability in O3 exposure across
participants. Note that because survival is relatively short in
patients with lung cancer, we expected short-term (seasonal)
variability
to
dominate
long-term
variability
during
each
patient’s follow-up period. W
e adjusted for month of diagnosis
in our models to account for potential confounding by short-
term temporal factors. Results were robust to sensitivity analyses
stratifying by categorised year of diagnosis, suggesting that long-
term trends did not induce spurious associations (particularly of
concern for early-stage diagnosis adenocarcinoma cases with
longer median survival). Finally, we lacked individual-level data
on important potential confounders/effect modifiers and risk
factors (eg, smoking, diet, alcohol use, education, access to care,
obesity, previous lung disease and occupational exposures).
These omitted factors could have spuriously induced the
observed associations only if they were strongly associated with
the spatiotemporal distribution of ambient air pollution expo-
sures, which seems unlikely. Previous studies have suggested that
non-smokers may be at greater risk for air pollution-related lung
cancer
incidence/mortality
than
current
smokers.10
While
smoking is an important risk factor, previous data suggest that,
at diagnosis, only 39% of patients with lung cancer are current
smokers (drops to 14% at 5 months after diagnosis).30

 In summary, we found evidence for associations between all-
cause and lung cancer-specific mortalities and NO2, PM2.5 and
PM10, robust to a number of sensitivity analyses. Future studies
should evaluate the impacts of ambient air pollution exposure
reduction, since controlling patients’ exposures could offer a
novel approach to improve lung cancer outcomes, especially
among patients diagnosed at early stages.
