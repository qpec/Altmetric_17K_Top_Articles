During 2011–2015, increased electronic cigarette (e-cig-
arette) and hookah use offset declines in cigarette and other 
tobacco product use among youths (persons aged <18 years) 
(1). Limited information exists about which tobacco product 
introduced youths to tobacco product use. Patterns of first 
use of e-cigarettes among Oregon youths who were tobacco 
users were assessed in the Oregon Healthy Teens 2015 survey, 
a cross-sectional survey of eighth and 11th grade students in 
Oregon. Respondents were asked, “The very first time you used 
any tobacco or vaping product, which type of product did you 
use?” Among students who had ever used any tobacco product 
(ever users), e-cigarettes were the most common introductory 
tobacco product reported by both eighth (43.5%) and 11th 
(34.4%) grade students. Among students who used a tobacco 
product for ≥1 day during the past 30 days (current users), 
e-cigarettes were the most common introductory tobacco prod-
uct reported by eighth grade students (44.4%) and the second 
most common introductory tobacco product reported by 
11th grade students (31.0%). Introductory use of e-cigarettes 
was commonly reported among youths in Oregon who were 
ever or current tobacco users, underscoring the importance 
of proven interventions to prevent all forms of tobacco use 
among youths (2,3).
Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable disease and 
death in the United States, and the majority of adult cigarette 
smokers first try smoking before age 18 years (2). During 
the past 3 decades, cigarette smoking among youths has 
declined substantially, in both Oregon and nationally (3–5). 
However, during 2011–2015, increased electronic cigarette 
and hookah use offset declines in cigarette and other tobacco 
product use among youths nationally; in 2014, e-cigarettes 
surpassed cigarettes as the most commonly used tobacco 
product among youths (1).
Among youths, use of e-cigarettes is strongly associated with 
use of other tobacco products, including combustible tobacco 
products (3,6). In 2015, the majority of students in U.S. mid-
dle and high school who used combustible tobacco (including 
conventional cigarettes) concurrently used e-cigarettes; how-
ever, which type of tobacco product these students are likely 
to use first remains unknown (3). Limited information exists 
about which product was used as an introduction to tobacco 
products after e-cigarettes became commonly used among U.S. 
youths (7). Using data from the Oregon Health Teens surveys, 
patterns of first use of e-cigarettes were assessed among youths 
in Oregon who were tobacco users.
Oregon Healthy Teens is a cross-sectional, school-based, 
biennial survey of health behaviors administered to Oregon 
eighth and 11th grade students. A statewide representative 
sample is obtained from a random sample of public high 
schools and their feeder middle schools, stratified by county. 
Students’ parents are notified before survey administration 
and can decline participation for their child. Students can 
opt out of participating at the time of survey administration. 
Responses are anonymous, and data are weighted based on 
statewide school enrollment numbers to represent students 
across Oregon proportionally. During February–May 2015, a 
total of 16,104 eighth grade and 13,570 11th grade students 
participated in the surveys; response rate was 83% among 308 
schools that were contacted for survey recruitment.
In 2015, respondents were asked, “The very first time you 
used any tobacco or vaping product, which type of product 
did you use?” Response options included the following: I have 
never used any tobacco or vaping product; cigarette; chewing 
tobacco; small cigar; large cigar; hookah; e-cigarette or other 
vaping product; and another type of product. The introductory 
tobacco product used was assessed among ever and current 
tobacco product users. Respondents were considered ever users 
if they indicated tobacco product use for the following survey 
questions: “How old were you when you smoked a whole ciga-
rette for the first time?” or “How old were you when you first 
used any form of tobacco other than cigarettes?” Respondents 
were considered current users if they indicated use of a tobacco 
product ≥1 day during the past 30 days. Tobacco products 
were categorized as cigarettes, e-cigarettes, hookahs, and other 
tobacco products (small cigars, large cigars, chewing tobacco, 
and unspecified tobacco products).
In 2015, among Oregon eighth grade students, 21.9% 
reported having ever used any tobacco product and 12.3% 
reported current use; among Oregon 11th grade students, 
41.7% reported having ever used any tobacco product, and 
23.7% reported current use. E-cigarettes were the most com-
mon introductory tobacco product among ever (43.5%) and 
current (44.4%) eighth grade users (Table). Among 11th grade 
users of any tobacco product, e-cigarettes were the most 
commonly reported introductory tobacco product among 
ever users (34.4%) and the second most commonly reported

introductory product among current users (31.0% of current 
users reported first using e-cigarettes and 31.1% reported first 
using conventional cigarettes).
Among eighth and 11th grade students who were conven-
tional cigarette users, e-cigarettes were the second most com-
mon introductory tobacco product among ever (25.1% and 
17.7%, respectively) and current (22.2% and 14.7%) users 
(Table). Among current conventional cigarette users who 
currently also used e-cigarettes, e-cigarettes were the second 
most common introductory tobacco product for both eighth 
(30.5%) and 11th grade students (15.4%).
Discussion
In 2015, e-cigarettes were the most common introductory 
tobacco product used among Oregon eighth and 11th grade 
students who had ever tried tobacco products. E-cigarettes 
were also a common introductory tobacco product for current 
conventional cigarette users among eighth and 11th grade 
students in Oregon. Although e-cigarettes were a commonly 
reported introductory product in both grades, the lower preva-
lence of introductory use of e-cigarettes among 11th grade 
students might reflect tobacco use initiation that occurred 
before the widespread availability of e-cigarettes. This study 
extends reports on the increases in e-cigarette use by examining 
introductory tobacco products among youths who were users 
of tobacco products. However, further studies are needed to 
establish temporality of e-cigarette and conventional tobacco 
product use among youths.
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita-
tions. First, the data were self-reported, and therefore, subject 
to recall and reporting bias. Second, observational data do not 
allow for evaluation of a causal link between e-cigarette use 
and initiation of cigarette smoking. Third, because the survey 
question of interest was first asked in 2015, it is not possible at 
this time to report a trend in introductory tobacco products. 
Finally, data are only collected from eighth and 11th grade 
students who attend public schools and are therefore not 
representative of all Oregon youths.
Introductory use of e-cigarettes was commonly reported 
among youths in Oregon who were ever or current tobacco 
users. A 2016 Surgeon General’s report concerning e-cigarettes 
concludes that use of nicotine-containing products in any form, 
including e-cigarettes, among youths is unsafe (3). The report 
notes that action can be taken at the national, state, local, tribal, 
and territorial levels to address e-cigarette use among youths 
and young adults. Public health interventions could include 
smoke-free policies that include e-cigarettes, restrictions on 
youths’ access to e-cigarettes, pricing strategies, retail licensure, 
regulation of e-cigarette marketing likely to attract youths, and 
educational initiatives focused toward youths and young adults 
(3). CDC has issued evidence-based guidelines to establish 
comprehensive tobacco control programs, and in 2016, the

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use among youths is strongly 
associated with use of other tobacco products, including 
combustible tobacco products. Limited information exists 
about which tobacco product introduced youths to the use of 
tobacco products after e-cigarettes became widely available in 
the late 2000s.
What is added by this report?
In 2015, e-cigarettes were commonly reported as the introduc-
tory tobacco product among youths who had ever used or 
currently use any tobacco product and cigarette smokers in 
eighth and 11th grades in Oregon.
What are the implications for public health practice?
The findings of this study underscore the importance of proven 
interventions to prevent all forms of tobacco use, including 
e-cigarettes, among youths.

Food and Drug Administration finalized rules extending its 
regulatory authority of tobacco products to include e-cigarettes 
(8,9). The findings of this study underscore the importance 
of proven interventions to prevent all forms of tobacco use, 
including e-cigarette use, among youths.
