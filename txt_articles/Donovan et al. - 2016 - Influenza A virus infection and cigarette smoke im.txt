Abstract
β2-adrenoceptor agonists are the mainstay therapy for patients with asthma but their effectiveness in cigarette
smoke (CS)-induced lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is limited. In addition,
bronchodilator efficacy of β2-adrenoceptor agonists is decreased during acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD),
caused by respiratory viruses including influenza A. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess the
effects of the β2-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol (SALB) on small airway reactivity using mouse precision cut lung
slices (PCLS) prepared from CS-exposed mice and from CS-exposed mice treated with influenza A virus (Mem71,
H3N1). CS exposure alone reduced SALB potency and efficacy associated with decreased β2-adrenoceptor mRNA
expression, and increased tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) expression. This impaired
relaxation was restored by day 12 in the absence of further CS exposure. In PCLS prepared after Mem71 infection
alone, responses to SALB were transient and were not well maintained. CS exposure prior to Mem71 infection
almost completely abolished relaxation, although β2-adrenoceptor and TNFα and IL-1β expression were unaltered.
The present study has shown decreased sensitivity to SALB after CS or a combination of CS and Mem71 occurs by
different mechanisms. In addition, the PCLS technique and our models of CS and influenza infection provide a novel
setting for assessment of alternative bronchodilators.

INTRODUCTION
Small airway dysfunction plays a crucial role in many obstruct-
ive lung diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease (COPD) [1,2]. Cigarette smoking is a major contributor to
COPD and also alters immune function to increase susceptibil-
ity to subsequent influenza A virus infection [3]. These infec-
tions are a major cause of acute exacerbations of COPD (termed
AECOPD) [4].
AECOPD are defined by a sudden worsening of symptoms
such as dyspnoea, wheezing, sputum production and cough initi-
ated by bacterial, viral or environmental agents, usually leading
to hospitalization [5,6]. Of note, infection with influenza virus is
associated with greater inflammatory responses [7] and loss of
lung function compared with exacerbations due to other causes
[8]. The greater severity of disease following infection in smokers

compared with non-smokers [9,10] is associated with inflamma-
tion and injury extending to the smaller airways in the distal lung
[11] and increased influenza-related mortality [12,13].
A further contributor to disease severity is the marked de-
crease in bronchodilator efficacy of β-adrenoceptor agonists in
AECOPD [14]. The mechanisms and pathways involved in this
loss of responsiveness to therapy following cigarette smoke (CS)
exposure and viral-induced exacerbations remain poorly under-
stood [15]. Therefore, preclinical models of COPD have been
developed to explore the mechanisms underlying CS-induced
lung inflammation and viral-induced exacerbations (as reviewed
in [16,17]).
To date, the use of precision cut lung slices (PCLS) to charac-
terize in vitro changes in small airway reactivity in these contexts
has been limited. We have recently shown that in vivo exposure
to CS for 4 days altered contractile responses of airways in PCLS

to serotonin (5HT), but not methacholine (MCh), but dilator re-
sponses were not assessed [18]. Previous studies using PCLS to
assess the effects of viral infection alone have been limited
to assessment of inflammation or infectivity after in vitro ex-
posure [19,20]. In one study, PCLS from C57BL/6 mice were
treated with poly I:C, a toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist struc-
turally similar to viral dsRNA [19]. Increased release and tissue
levels of tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin-6 (IL-6)
and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) confirmed a
marked inflammatory response of structural cells and/or resident
immunocytes. In another study, PCLS from pigs were exposed
in vitro to five different types of swine influenza virus [20]. The
swine influenza viruses infected both the ciliary cells and the mu-
cous producing cells in the epithelium, with the highest titration
of virus at 24 h post-infection. However, these studies of viral
exposure in vitro did not assess airway contraction or relaxation.
Therefore, it is clear from the literature that the effects of in vivo
viral infection in any animal species with or without exposure to
CS, on in vitro airway reactivity have not been explored.
Mem71 is a reassortment of influenza virus strain carrying
haemagglutinin of strain A/Memphis/1/71 (H3) and neuramini-
dase of strain A/Bellamy/42 (N1). We have recently shown that
mice exposed to CS for 4 days and then infected with Mem71 on
day 5, had an exacerbated airway inflammatory response com-
pared with either stimulus alone [21]. Moreover, prior CS ex-
posure disrupts the resolution of influenza infection in mice.
However, the influence of CS alone or the combination of CS and
Mem71 exposure in vivo on bronchodilator responses remains to
be addressed.
Given this background, the aim of the present study was
to assess the effects of the β2-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol
(SALB) on changes in small airway reactivity using mouse PCLS
prepared from CS-exposed mice and from CS-exposed mice
treated with influenza A virus (Mem71, H3N1).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
All materials are from Sigma–Aldrich unless otherwise stated.
Animals and ethics
All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Eth-
ics Committee at the University of Melbourne (approval number
1212485). Male mice were obtained from the Animal Resources
Centre, Western Australia aged 6–12 weeks. All mice were accli-
matized for a minimum of 3 days prior to beginning experimental
protocols and randomly assigned treatment groups. Each group
of mice (sham alone, CS alone for 4 days or sham PBS, sham
Mem71, CS PBS, CS Mem71 over 12 days) were housed in sep-
arate cages with a maximum of ten mice per cage, and allowed
standard animal chow and water ad libitum.
CS exposure
Mice were placed in an 18 L Perspex chamber and exposed to CS
generated from nine Winfield Red cigarettes (comprises <16 mg
tar, <1.2 mg nicotine and <15 mg of carbon monoxide) per day
for 4 days as described above [18,22]. Sham mice were exposed
to room air for the same time periods. Mice were culled on day
5, and lungs were collected and used for either preparation of
PCLS or for quantitative real-time PCR after freezing in liquid
nitrogen.
CS exposure followed by Mem71 infection
Mice were exposed to CS or room air (for sham) for 4 days (as
described above). On day 5, mice were anaesthetized by inhal-
ation of methoxyflurane (Medical Developments International)
and infected intranasally with 104.5 plaque forming units (PFU)
of the mildly virulent influenza A virus Mem71 (H3N1) in a 30 μl
volume, diluted in PBS as described [21]. Control mice were an-
aesthetized as described above and given 30 μl of PBS. All mice
(sham PBS, sham Mem71, CS PBS, CS Mem71) were weighed
daily throughout the protocol between 8:30 and 8:45 hours, and
culled on day 12 (7 days post-infection or PBS). Lungs were col-
lected and used for either PCLS or quantitative real-time PCR.
Precision cut lung slices preparation and protocols
PCLS were prepared as recently described [18,23]. Briefly,
mice were killed by overdose of 0.4 mg/ml of 60 mg/ml so-
dium pentobarbitone, injected i.p. Lungs were inflated with
∼1.4 ml of 2% agarose gel dissolved in 1X HBSS (hanks bal-
anced salt solution) containing 20 mM Hepes (Gibco/Invitrogen)
followed by a bolus of air through the trachea via a two
port 20G cannula (Intima). Lungs were solidified in ice-
cold 1X HBSS/Hepes before slices (150 μm) were serially
sectioned from the left lobe using a vibratome (VT 1000S,
Leicamicrosystems) and transferred into a 24-well plate contain-
ing Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) supplemen-
ted with 1% penicillin–streptomycin solution (Gibco/Invitrogen).
Slices were incubated at 37 ◦C and 5% CO2 for subsequent ex-
perimental use.
Experiments were performed within 48 h of PCLS prepara-
tion. For contractile agonists MCh, 5HT, each concentration of
drug was perfused for 5 min. For bronchodilator experiments,
airways were submaximally pre-contracted with 5HT prior to
cumulative additions of SALB or isoprenaline (ISO) at 5 min
intervals.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Lungs were prepared as described above [18]. Gene expres-
sion was quantitatively analysed using an ABI Prism 7900HT
sequence detection system (Life Technologies) using a pre-
validated TaqMan® Gene Expression Assays. The primer ID
number for the β-adrenoceptor (gene: adrb2): Mm02524224_s1,

were expressed as change in grams from the starting weight, with
statistical analysis by one-way ANOVA with post-hoc tests on
raw weight values over time within group and at day 12 between
groups. For quantitative real-time PCR analysis, threshold cycle

and compared using Mann–Whitney non-parametric test com-
pared with PBS or one-way ANOVA compared with sham PBS

ficance. Statistical analysis was carried out on Graph Pad PrismTM
(version 5.0b).
RESULTS
CS exposure impairs bronchodilator responses to
salbutamol
The potential influence of CS on dilator responsiveness in PCLS
was assessed. We have recently identified altered contractile re-
sponses to 5HT after 4 days CS exposure [18]. As reported above,
4 days CS exposure led to a decrease in body weight (final weight
– day 5: sham 24.9 +
− 0.7; CS 22.6 +
− 0.2, P < 0.05, unpaired t
test). To extend these findings, airways were pre-contracted with
300 nM 5HT, prior to addition of SALB (0.1–10 μM) (Figures 1
and 2).
Representative traces in PCLS from sham- and CS-exposed
mice show that SALB induced concentration-dependent partial
relaxation (Figure 1). Pre-contraction with 300 nM 5HT was
lower in the CS group, with 5HT eliciting a biphasic contraction
(% initial airway lumen area: sham 53.1 +
− 4.8; CS 71.8 +
− 3.9,
P < 0.05, unpaired t test) (Figures 1 and 2A). Relaxation to
SALB was maximal at 3 μM in both groups (% relaxation: sham
40.9 +
− 7.9; CS 35.9 +
− 6.2) with ∼ 5-fold lower potency follow-
ing CS (Figures 1 and 2B). In PCLS from CS-exposed mice,
relaxation responses were transient and not well maintained over
the concentration range tested (Figure 1B).
Relaxation responses to individual concentrations of SALB
(0.1 μM, 1 μM and 10 μM) were tested in separate PCLS from
both groups, to determine whether cumulative addition had con-
tributed to the loss of β2-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation fol-
lowing CS exposure. The level of submaximal pre-contraction
to 5HT was consistent across all slices (results not shown). Re-
laxation responses to SALB in individual slices were similar to
those seen at the same concentration in cumulative concentration–
response curves (% relaxation to 10−6 M SALB: sham in
individual PCLS 36.7 +
− 10.0; sham from cumulative curves
39.2 +
− 8.3, P > 0.05, unpaired t test). Relaxation responses in
individual PCLS from CS-exposed mice were even lower than
when added cumulatively (% relaxation to 10−6 M SALB: CS
individual 1.8 +
− 9.0; CS cumulative 31.2 +
− 9.0) (Figure 2C).
Figure 1 SALB-mediated relaxation is decreased following CS
exposure
Mice were exposed to room air (sham) or CS for 4 days before prepara-
tion of PCLS. Representative traces from (A) sham- and (B) CS-exposed
mice show a frame-by-frame analysis (0.5 Hz) of changes in airway lu-
men area with time in the presence of 300 nM 5HT and increasing
concentrations of SALB.
This loss of dilator responsiveness was associated with ∼40%
reduction in β2-adrenoceptor expression in the lungs of mice
following 4 days CS exposure (Figure 2D). Both TNFα and IL-
1β expression were increased ∼4-fold and ∼2-fold respectively
(Figures 2E and 2F).
CS exposure and Mem71 infection in vivo alters
body weight
To assess the effect of this prior CS exposure on responses to
influenza A virus infection, mice were treated with CS (or air for
sham) for 4 days followed by 104.5 PFU of Mem71 (H3N1) (or
PBS) on day 5, then culled 7 days post-infection (i.e. on day 12 of
the experimental protocol). In a similar model, mice treated with
CS followed by Mem71 had sustained cellular inflammation in
the lung over this period despite resolution of viral infection by
day 10 [21,24]. In the present study, body weights were recorded
daily, and PCLS were prepared on day 12 to assess constrictor
responses to MCh and 5HT, and dilator responses to SALB and
ISO.
Sham mice gained weight over the first 4 days period, whereas
CS mice lost ∼1.5 g (weight: day 1 – CS PBS 22.0 +
− 0.32 g;
day 4 – CS PBS 20.8 +
− 0.4 g, P = 0.0001) (Figure 3). Follow-
ing intranasal administration of PBS on day 5, sham PBS mice
maintained their weight over the subsequent 7 days period. After
cessation of CS exposure on day 5, CS PBS mice initially gained
weight, but subsequently lost weight on day 7 prior to regaining
their initial weight by day 12. Following intranasal administra-
tion of Mem71 on day 5, both sham Mem71 and CS Mem71

(sham PBS, CS PBS, sham Mem71 and CS Mem71) were weighed daily
at 8:45 hours until day 12 (7 days post-infection). Data are expressed
as mean +
− S.E.M. as a change in weight from day 1 (n=10 per group).
CS exposure and Mem71 infection in vivo impairs
dilator responses in mouse small airways ex vivo
Prior to assessment of bronchodilator responsiveness, constrictor
responses to MCh and 5HT were compared in PCLS from sham
PBS, CS PBS, sham Mem71 and CS Mem71 treated mice. The
potency of both agonists was similar in all groups (Supplementary
Figure S1). The maximum responses to both constrictor agents
tested were similar between sham PBS and CS PBS groups.
Increased maximal contraction to MCh was seen in sham Mem71
compared with sham PBS (P < 0.05) and 5HT contraction tended
to increase in CS Mem71 groups respectively (Supplementary
Figure S1). These changes were not associated with differences
in mRNA expression of M2, M3 or 5HT2A (results not shown).
Bronchodilator responses to SALB and ISO were then tested
following submaximal pre-contraction with 5HT (Figures 4 and
5). In PCLS from sham PBS mice, 5HT induced a monophasic
response (∼40% reduction in airway lumen area) (Figure 4A).
The pattern of the pre-contraction to 5HT was altered in all other
treatment groups. Small airways in PCLS from CS PBS (Fig-
ure 4B) and sham Mem71 (Figure 4C) mice had biphasic 5HT
contractions, whereas the contraction to 5HT in the CS Mem71
group was rapid and not sustained, followed by a more slowly
developing contraction (Figure 4D). However, similar reductions
in airway area were achieved prior to exposure to SALB (not
significant, P > 0.05, one-way ANOVA).

Although SALB induced concentration-dependent relaxation
in all groups, the pattern of relaxation differed (Figure 4). Relax-
ation to SALB in PCLS from CS PBS mice was greatest within
the first minute of exposure (Figure 4B), however this waned over
time to reach a maximum of ∼50% at 10 μM levels of relaxa-
tion, similar to sham PBS mice (Figures 4A and 5A). In PCLS
from sham Mem71 mice, relaxation was very transient and not
well maintained, with a maximum relaxation response to 3 μM
SALB and re-contraction evident at 10 μM SALB (Figures 4C
and 5B). The transient and not well maintained relaxation re-
sponses to SALB in PCLS from CS Mem71 mice were more
pronounced than in sham Mem71 or CS PBS mice. Relaxation
was not sustained at any of the concentrations tested (Figures 4D
and 5C) and was the lowest in response to 10 μM SALB of all
groups (sham PBS 51.6 +
− 16.5; sham Mem71 41.1 +
− 17.2; CS
PBS 53.5 +
− 9.4; CS Mem71 15.3 +
− 20.2) (Figures 5A–5C).
There were no differences in β2-adrenoceptor measured in
whole lung lysates from all four groups (Figure 5D). However,
TNFα mRNA expression was decreased by 80% in lungs from
sham Mem71 mice, with CS PBS and CS Mem71 groups sim-
ilar to sham PBS (Figure 5E). IL-1β mRNA expression was
unchanged (Figure 5F).
In separate PCLS prepared from all groups, airways were pre-
contracted with 5HT prior to ISO (Supplementary Figure S2).
Relaxation was also the lowest in the CS Mem71 group with the
maximum relaxation at 0.3 μM ISO (% relaxation: sham PBS:
74.3 +
− 19.8, CS Mem71 56.9 +
− 14.8).
DISCUSSION
The present study has examined airway reactivity in PCLS pre-
pared from mice exposed to CS (4 days) alone or mice exposed to
CS and then infected with influenza A virus (Mem71). The ma-
jor findings were that dilator responses to SALB were impaired
by CS exposure alone, and almost completely abolished when
CS exposure was followed by Mem71 infection. The reduction
in relaxation in CS-exposed mice was associated with reduced
β2-adrenoceptor expression and increased TNFα and IL-1β ex-
pression after acute CS exposure. However, the impaired bron-
chodilator responses in CS and influenza-infected mice were not
associated with changes in β2-adrenoceptor, TNFα and IL-1β
expression, suggesting additional mechanisms at play following
viral infection. This reduction in β2-adrenoceptor-mediated re-
laxation is consistent with the loss of clinical responsiveness to
dilator therapy in cigarette smokers and in AECOPD.
Respiratory viruses represent a large burden on our health-
care system, particular in patients with underlying lung diseases
such as asthma and COPD, when their symptoms are exacer-
bated. Although research in the field has been focused around the
immunological changes caused by viruses, the functional effects
of viral infection on the airways, particularly in the distal lung,
are not well characterized. However, clinical data have shown
the viral infection induces airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR)
to MCh in both healthy subjects and people with asthma and
COPD [25,26] and AHR to histamine in asthmatic subjects fol-
lowing influenza A virus infection [27]. It has been established
that viruses can alter airway reactivity through the production of
immunoglobulin E (IgE), damage to the epithelium, increased
inflammatory cytokine release and enhanced mediator release
[28].
Bronchodilator therapy may be ineffective in patients with
lung diseases who are exposed to viral infections. The most com-
mon reliever drug, SALB, a partial agonist at β2-adrenoceptors,
dilates airways through increasing levels of cAMP
. Diminished
responsiveness to the β-adrenoceptor agonist ISO has been
demonstrated following a viral upper respiratory tract infection,
with the cAMP response greatest in healthy controls, slightly
decreased in asthmatics and dramatically reduced in asthmatics
with viral infection [29,30].
The aim of the present study was to establish whether a similar
loss of β-adrenoceptor responsiveness seen clinically occurs in
mouse models of CS exposure and combined CS and influenza
A virus exposure. More importantly, we were able to evaluate
the contribution of the small airways to this process by using
PCLS. There is evidence in the literature that the magnitude and
type of inflammatory response to CS and influenza A virus in-
fection in mice is dependent on the strain of mouse and influenza
A virus used. For the purpose of our study, we used our well
characterized models in BALB/C mice which have a robust in-
flammatory response to CS compared with C57BL/6 mice [22].
Although C57BL/6 mice are more susceptible to virus infection
due to a Th-1 driven immune response [31–33] and the produc-
tion of type-1 interferons [34], inflammation following CS in this
strain is limited [22]. In addition, an exacerbated viral response
following virus and CS-exposure is seen in BALB/C but not in
C57BL/6 mice [21,34,35].
The impact of CS and CS+ influenza A virus infection on
body weight was assessed prior to airway reactivity experiments.
We confirmed the pattern recently observed in CS- and influ-
enza A virus-treated mice over the 12 days treatment period [21].
However, by measuring weight daily, the present study has also
identified that in addition to CS alone causing weight loss, there
was a biphasic weight gain when CS exposure was followed by
a single PBS administration (CS PBS group). One explanation
for the transient weight gain on day 6 is that smoking cessation
and PBS treatment reduces CS-associated loss of appetite and/or
dehydration. The subsequent loss of weight on day 7 may reflect a
response to CS withdrawal, whereas the increased weight on day
8 may be due to appetite recovery and fluid intake as the effects
of the CS are wearing off by this time, resulting in restored body
weights by days 9–12 [36].
To assess CS- and influenza A virus-induced changes on air-
way reactivity, we have utilized the PCLS technique. One of the
major advantages of this approach is that interactions between
the airways and surrounding parenchyma remain intact when
measuring contraction and relaxation [37,38]. Previous studies
using mice treated with allergen to induce AHR in vivo have
shown variable effects on in vitro responses to MCh in PCLS,
which may reflect differential effects of these models on air-
way wall remodelling [39–41]. We do not anticipate gross struc-
tural changes following in vivo exposure to CS and/or influenza
A virus in the present study, as similar models have shown no
structural changes to CS and/or influenza A virus model culled

 Impaired relaxation following cigarette smoke and virus infection
at peak viral infection [21,22], and the acute exposure and resol-
ution of inflammation by day 7 post-infection [24]. However, CS
or its components have been shown to induce cellular toxicity to
a range of cell types including bronchial epithelial cells and air-
way smooth muscle cells [42–44]. Assessment of reactivity day 7
post-infection (during resolution of inflammation) was chosen to
assess whether CS-induced changes following 4 days of exposure
[18] would be maintained, and whether changes in reactivity are
evident even when viral load has been reduced.
Both 5HT and MCh increase both calcium oscillations and
calcium sensitivity pathways to cause airway smooth muscle con-
traction. However, we have recently shown that 4 days CS expos-
ure selectively altered airway contraction in PCLS to 5HT but
not MCh, associated with down-regulation of ryanodine receptor
expression [18]. In the present study, it was not surprising that
contraction to MCh in CS PBS mice was unchanged when meas-
ured after 7 days in the absence of CS exposure. However, the
normalized response to 5HT suggests restoration of normal con-
traction within 8 days. Interestingly, 7 days after sham Mem71
treatment, in vitro contraction to MCh was increased despite
the absence of significant viral load [24]. In vivo AHR to MCh
was not observed following respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
infection in mice [45], but the present finding is consistent with
AHR following infection in the clinical setting [46] and also
following parainfluenza type-3 virus infection in guinea pigs, as-
sociated with decreased production of nitric oxide post-infection
[47]. This mechanism is unlikely to be underlying the increased
response to MCh following Mem71 infection, as the in vitro
perfusion of drugs across the PCLS would limit any influence of
decreased production of epithelial-derived relaxing factors. How-
ever, although the mRNA expression of M2 and M3 receptors was
unchanged, protein levels or receptor signalling may be altered,
as shown in guinea pigs treated with parainfluenza where M2
dysfunction was seen [48]. In addition, the increased contraction
to MCh in sham Mem71 mice, but not CS Mem71 mice, remains
to be explained.
Following 4 days CS exposure, SALB-mediated relaxation
was impaired both in potency and the ability to maintain a
sustained relaxation. This was associated with β2-adrenoceptor
down-regulation, and increased inflammatory cytokines, TNFα
and IL-1β, shown to decrease β-adrenoceptor responsiveness
in airway smooth muscle in vitro [49,50]. It is possible that
the decreased potency of SALB in cumulative concentration–
response curves in PCLS from CS-treated mice underestimated
the effects of CS exposure. These airways were pre-contracted
to a lesser extent than sham controls and it is well established
that this would increase SALB potency [23]. Consistent with
this, greater inhibition of SALB-mediated relaxation was seen
in individual PCLS with matched pre-contraction after CS ex-
posure. Under these conditions, the influence of previous ex-
posure to lower concentrations of SALB within the same slice
was removed, suggesting that there is not greater desensitiz-
ation of the β-adrenoceptor following CS exposure. Of note,
relaxation to SALB measured in PCLS prepared 7 days after
cessation of CS exposure was restored, and was associated
with normalized expression of the β2-adrenoceptor, TNFα and
IL-1β.
One of the crucial findings of the present study was the loss of
β-adrenoceptor responsiveness measured at day 7 post-infection.
At this time point, these mice have almost no virus in the lung and
the inflammatory response to the virus has subsided [36]. SALB-
mediated relaxation in PCLS from both sham Mem71 and CS
Mem71 mice was not well sustained across the full concentra-
tion range tested, and markedly impaired in the combined model
where transient and not well maintained responses to SALB were
evident, even at low concentrations. These combined findings
indicate that impaired airway smooth muscle relaxation follow-
ing CS exposure alone can be restored; viral infection alone can
also reduce responsiveness to SALB, and that viral infection after
CS exposure can exacerbate the loss of dilator sensitivity even
when exposure to CS is ceased.
In both sham Mem71 and CS Mem71 groups, β2-
adrenoceptor expression was unchanged, and TNFα and IL-1β
were not increased, so the reduced responsiveness to SALB
may be due to alternative viral-driven mechanisms that could
include decreased production or loss of sensitivity to cAMP
, in-
creases in phosphodiesterase activity to reduce availability of
cAMP
, or increased activation of mechanisms driving contrac-
tion to oppose SALB-mediated relaxation. Since relaxation to
the β1/β2-adrenoceptor agonist ISO was only slightly decreased
in CS Mem71 treated mice relative to sham PBS, changes in the
β2-adrenoceptor itself are also possible, with CS and Mem71-
induced changes in the conformational state of the receptor to
cause decreased signalling downstream.
In summary, this is the first study to demonstrate impaired
β-adrenoceptor sensitivity of small airways in PCLS from mouse
models of CS and/or influenza A virus infection. Although re-
duced SALB-mediated relaxation could be restored following
cessation of CS exposure, subsequent viral infection abolished
any sustained relaxation to the β2-adrenoceptor agonist. Future
studies at day 3 post-infection, when inflammation and viral load
are at their peak, are warranted to define the onset of mechan-
isms contributing to this loss of dilator sensitivity. The present
study provides a validated model to assess novel bronchodilator
agonists, which in combination with new antiviral medication
may provide relief for lung disease patients with viral infections
where their current therapy is ineffective.
CLINICAL PERSPECTIVES
• CS and respiratory virus infections are a major cause of COPD
and exacerbations of COPD, respectively. The aim of the
present study was to assess the effects of β-adrenoceptor agon-
ists on changes in small airway reactivity using mouse PCLS
prepared from CS-exposed mice and from CS-exposed mice
infected with influenza A virus.
• This is the first study to demonstrate impaired β-adrenoceptor
sensitivity of small airways in PCLS from mice exposed to CS
and mice exposed to CS infected with influenza A virus.
• We provide a validated model to assess novel bronchodilator
agonists that may be of use in CS-induced lung disease such as
COPD and influenza A virus-induced exacerbations of COPD.
