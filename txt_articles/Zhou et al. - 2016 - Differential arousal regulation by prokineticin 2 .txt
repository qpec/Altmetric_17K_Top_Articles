Abstract
The temporal organization of activity/rest or sleep/wake rhythms for mammals is regulated by the interaction of
light/dark cycle and circadian clocks. The neural and molecular mechanisms that confine the active phase to either
day or night period for the diurnal and the nocturnal mammals are unclear. Here we report that prokineticin 2,
previously shown as a circadian clock output molecule, is expressed in the intrinsically photosensitive retinal
ganglion cells, and the expression of prokineticin 2 in the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells is
oscillatory in a clock-dependent manner. We further show that the prokineticin 2 signaling is required for the
activity and arousal suppression by light in the mouse. Between the nocturnal mouse and the diurnal monkey, a
signaling receptor for prokineticin 2 is differentially expressed in the retinorecipient suprachiasmatic nucleus and
the superior colliculus, brain projection targets of the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells. Blockade
with a selective antagonist reveals the respectively inhibitory and stimulatory effect of prokineticin 2 signaling on
the arousal levels for the nocturnal mouse and the diurnal monkey. Thus, the mammalian diurnality or nocturnality
is likely determined by the differential signaling of prokineticin 2 from the intrinsically photosensitive retinal
ganglion cells onto their retinorecipient brain targets.

Introduction
The temporal organization of activity/rest or sleep/wake
rhythms for mammals is regulated by the interaction of
light/dark cycle and circadian clocks. Several lines of
evidence indicate that the known master circadian clock,
suprachiasmatic (SCN), operates quite similarly in noc-
turnal and diurnal mammals. The oscillations of clock-
work genes, such as Bmal1, Per1, and Per2, are in the
same phase in the SCN, regardless whether the mam-
mals are diurnal or nocturnal [1, 2]. The firing rate and
the glucose utilization of SCN neurons are also in the
same phase for both the nocturnal and the diurnal mam-
mals [3, 4]. The same phase oscillation has also been
shown for the two SCN output molecules, vasopressin
and prokineticin 2 (PK2) [5–7]. Therefore, the divergent
mechanisms that confine the active phase to either day
or night period for the diurnal and the nocturnal mam-
mals have been postulated to lie downstream of the SCN
clock [4, 8, 9]. However, no such divergent mechanism
has been identified.
Besides modulating the activity/rest or the sleep/wake
rhythms indirectly via its ability to phase shift and
entrain the SCN circadian clock to the ambient light–
dark cycle, light also exerts a direct effect on the activity
or arousal levels. In the nocturnal animals, light strongly
suppresses activity and induces sleep (photosomnolence)
[10, 11]. In the diurnal mammals, such as monkeys and
humans, light produces opposite effects of inducing the
arousal or increasing the activity levels [12–14]. For the
nocturnal animals, the direct light effect of activity sup-
pression is commonly referred to as masking [10, 11, 15].
Light-induced activity suppression and circadian clock
entrainment appears to utilize the identical photic input

 pathways from the retina. Both classical (rod/cone)
photoreceptors and intrinsically photosensitive retinal
ganglion cells (ipRGC), the retinal ganglion cells that
express melanopsin (OPN4), participate in the masking
and the circadian clock entrainment, as well as other
non-image-forming
visual
responses
such
as
the
pupillary reflex [11, 16–19]. Masking is attenuated in
Opn4-deficient mice [18], and is essentially abolished in
the mice deficient in both Opn4 and rod photorecep-
tors [20]. Masking and circadian clock entrainment to
light/dark cycle is completely abolished in the mice
lacking the ipRGC generated by genetic or chemical
ablation [21–25]. Thus, the ipRGC are the only channels
that relay the photic information to brains for the masking
and the circadian clock entrainment. The neural pathway
of mediating the light masking downstream of the ipRGC
is thought to act through the retinohypothalamic tract
(RHT) projection to the SCN [9, 11], the same neural
pathway that mediates the phase shifting and the
entrainment of the SCN clock. The light masking was
abolished with complete transection of RHT [26]. SCN
lesion together with the loss of RHT eliminates the
circadian rhythmicity as well as the light masking [27].
Transplantation
of
embryonic
SCN
to
arrhythmic
adults restores some locomotor rhythmicity without
restoring the masking effect [28]. Thus, the ipRGC-
SCN neural pathway appears to be critical for the light
masking in the nocturnal animals.
In the current study, we show the oscillatory expres-
sion of PK2, previously demonstrated as a critical SCN
output signal, in the ipRGC in a clock-dependent man-
ner. We further show that PK2 signaling is required for
the sustained light-induced activity suppression and
sleep induction in mice. Blockade with PK2 antagonist
demonstrated the opposite effects of the PK2 signaling
on the arousal levels in the nocturnal mouse and the
diurnal monkey. Together with the observed differential
expression of a PK2 signaling receptor in the retinoreci-
pient brain targets of the ipRGC between the nocturnal
mouse and the diurnal monkey, the mammalian diurnal/
nocturnal determination lies among the ipRGC-brain
pathways, upstream of the SCN clock.
Results
PK2 signaling is required for the sustained light-induced
suppression of the locomotor activity and the arousal in
mice
Mice deficient in genes of either PK2 (PK2−/−) or its
receptor (PKR2) had reduced circadian rhythms of
locomotor activity under constant darkness condition
[29, 30]. We observed that the PK2−/− mice also
displayed increased daytime locomotor activity under
light/dark (LD) cycle (data not shown), which is con-
sistent with prior observation of increased wakefulness
in the PK2−/− mice during light period [31]. These ob-
servations suggested that the light suppression effect is
abnormal in the absence of PK2 signaling. We thus
examined the suppression effect of light pulses on the
locomotor activities and the arousal levels in the PK2
−/− mice. When a light pulse (150 lux) was adminis-
trated to the wild type mice during the middle of dark
period (ZT16-ZT18.5), the locomotor activities were
significantly suppressed (Fig. 1a). In contrast, only mar-
ginal suppression of the locomotor activities by light
pulses was observed for the PK2−/− mice (Fig. 1a and
Insert). As expected, EEG/EMG recording revealed that
light pulses suppressed wakefulness in the wild type
mice (Fig. 1b and Insert). For the PK2−/− mice, the
light suppression on the wakefulness was only signifi-
cant for the first 30 min (Fig. 1b). Thus, light could still
suppress the wakefulness in the PK2−/− mice, but the
suppression effect was not maintained.
We further investigated the light suppression effect on
the locomotor activities and the arousal levels with dim
light. Just before the ending of the regular ~150 lux illu-
mination condition at ZT12, the light intensity was
dimmed to ~30 lux during the four hour period corre-
sponding to ZT12-ZT16. This reduced illumination con-
tinuously suppressed the locomotor activities of the wild
type mice (Fig. 2a). In contrast, the PK2−/− mice dis-
played quite robust locomotor activities in response to
the light intensity reduction, achieving the activity levels
quite comparable to that were under darkness (Fig. 2a).
This observation indicated that, at the high homeostatic
drive for the activities during late day, dim light was no
longer able to markedly suppress the locomotor activ-
ities in the PK2−/− mice. EEG/EMG recording con-
firmed the corresponding arousal levels affected by this
dim light treatment. For the wild type mice, the time
staying awake during these four hours of dim light was
much more reduced than under darkness, revealing a
strong sleep induction effect of the dim light (Fig. 2b).
For the PK2−/− mice, the wakefulness time under dim
light and under darkness were quite similar, indicating
only marginal arousal inhibition by the dim light in the
absence of PK2 signaling (Fig. 2b). Together, these
results indicate that PK2 signaling is required for the
sustained light-induced suppression of the locomotor ac-
tivity and the arousal in mice.
Clock-dependent oscillatory expression of PK2 in the
intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGC)
The diminished suppression effect of light on the
arousal levels and the locomotor activities in the PK2
−/− mice implicates that PK2 signaling is likely in-
volved in ipRGC-brain neural pathways, as the ipRGC
have been shown as the only photic channels for the
central transmission of the non-visional functions of

 light, including the locomotor activity suppression and
sleep induction [22–25, 32, 33]. We thus examined the
likely expression of PK2 in the ipRGC. As shown in
Figs. 3a and 4, PK2 is quite roburstly expressed in some
retinal ganglion cells. Further co-immunostaining stud-
ies indicated that all OPN4-positive retinal ganglion
cells express PK2 (28/28 cells, Fig. 3). The ~100 % co-
expression of PK2 and OPN4 in the ipRGC indicated
that PK2 of the ipRGC projects to the SCN and other
non-visional light functional areas of brain, such as the
superior colliculus (SC) [34–36].
The PK2 expression in the ipRGC was shown to oscil-
late in a Bmal1-dependent manner under light and dark
conditions (Fig. 5). In wild type mice, the peak and
trough PK2 levels in the ipRGC were around ZT4 and
ZT20, respectively. In contrast, PK2 levels in the ipRGC
of Bmal1-deficient mice were constantly low, and no ap-
parent PK2 oscillation was observed. Further, the oscilla-
tory phase of PK2 levels in the ipRGC, including the
peak and trough timing at ~ ZT4 and ~ ZT20, respect-
ively, is quite similar to the PK2 oscillation observed in
the SCN clock [6], indicating the regulation by same

 molecular oscillators. Consistent with the essential role
of PK2 for the activity suppression by light, the PK2
expression levels in the ipRGC correlated with the
extent of light suppression effect (Fig. 6). About 75 % of
locomotor activity was suppressed by light pulses (300
lux) delivered at ZT14-16.5, with the suppression effect
of light pulses decreasing to about 33 % when delivered
at ZT19-ZT21.5, during the trough PK2 expression
period in the ipRGC. Taken together, these results
indicate that the oscillatory expression of PK2 in the
ipRGC is a clock-dependent process.

 covering both the ventral and dorsal compartments of the
SCN (Fig. 7b) [6, 37]. It has been shown that ventral SCN
is retinorecipient, i.e., receiving the retinal inputs for the
light masking and circadian clock entrainment [9, 38].
The expression of PKR2 in the retinorecipient SCN in the
mouse indicates that the mouse ventral SCN likely
responds to PK2 signal from the ipRGC. Our previous
electrophysiological studies have shown that PK2 in-
creases the electric activities of neurons that express PKR2
[39, 40]. In the monkey brain, PKR2 is only expressed in
the dorsal SCN, but is not detected in the ventral SCN
(Fig. 8a). As with the nocturnal animals, the ventral SCN
has been shown as the retinorecipient compartment of
the SCN clock [38, 41]. The absence of the PKR2 expres-
sion in the ventral SCN indicates an inability of this
branch of monkey SCN to respond to the PK2 signal from
the ipRGC. Importantly, distinct expression of PKR2
between the mouse and monkey brains was also observed
in the superior colliculus (SC), another critical non-vision
brain target of the ipRGC [34–36]. As shown in Fig. 8c,
PKR2 was robustly expressed in the superficial layer of the
SC in the monkey brain. The superficial layer of the SC is
known to receive inputs from the retinal ganglion cells, in-
cluding the ipRGC [34–36]. In contrast, PKR2 expression
was not detected in the SC of the mouse brain (Fig. 8d),
indicating the absence of PK2 signaling via the ipRGC-SC
in the mouse.
Opposite effects of PK2 blockade on the arousal levels in
the nocturnal mouse and the diurnal monkey
We next examined the effect of a synthetic PK2 antag-
onist, PKR#7, on the arousal levels in the mice and the
monkeys. As shown in Fig. 9a and b, administration of
PKR#7 significantly increased the locomotor activity and

PK2−/− mice (N = 6) at ZT14, ZT16 and ZT19. The percentage of activity suppression was calculated by comparing to the locomotor activities of
the corresponding periods without light pulses. Light pulses significantly inhibited the locomotor activities of WT mice delivered at all three time
points (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P < 0.01 for ZT14, ZT16, and ZT19, respectively, paired t-tests), but with decreasing degree of suppression (ZT14 vs
ZT16, P < 0.001, ZT16 vs ZT19, P < 0.05, paired t-tests). Light pulses only significantly inhibited the locomotor activities of the PK2−/− mice when
delivered at ZT14 (P < 0.05, paired t-test)

 the wakefulness in the mice. These results are consistent
with prior observation of increased wakefulness in the
PK2−/− mice [31]. Thus, PK2 signal is overall inhibitory
for the arousal levels for the nocturnal mice. In contrast,
administration of the PK2 antagonist in the monkeys re-
sulted in a significant increase (>70 min) of the sleep time
(Fig. 9c), indicating that the PK2 signal is stimulatory for
the arousal level in the diurnal monkeys.
Discussions
In the current study, we have shown that PK2 is expressed
in the centrally projecting ipRGC. As the ipRGC are the

 only photic channels for the central transmission of the
non-visional functions of light, the absence of the sus-
tained light-induced activity suppression and sleep induc-
tion in the PK2−/− mice indicates that the PK2 signaling
of the ipRGC is critical for mediating the direct effect of
light on the arousal regulation in the nocturnal mouse.
The Bmal1-dependent oscillation of PK2 in the ipRGC in-
dicates that PK2 expression in the ipRGC is controlled by
the known circadian oscillator. Blocking the PK2 signaling
via administration of a PK2 antagonist demonstrated the
opposite effects of the PK2 signal on the arousal levels:
being inhibitory for the nocturnal mouse and stimulatory
for the diurnal monkey. Between the nocturnal mouse
and the diurnal monkey, PK2 receptor is differentially
expressed in the retinorecipient SCN and SC, brain pro-
jection targets of the ipRGC. Taken together, these results
indicate a likely mechanism of the nocturnal and diurnal
divergence lies in the differential PK2 signaling of the
ipRGC onto their brain targets (Fig. 10).
The PK2 signaling of the ipRGC likely regulates the
arousal levels via impinging on the brain targets of the
ipRGC, particularly the SCN and the SC. The differential
expression of the PK2 receptor (PKR2) in the retinoreci-
pient compartment of the SCN and the retinorecipient
superficial layer of the SC may then underlie the oppos-
ite effects of light on the arousal levels between the noc-
turnal mouse and the diurnal monkey. In the mouse
brain, PKR2 is robustly expressed in the retinorecipient
SCN, but absent in the SC, and the PK2 signaling of the
ipRGC thus funnels through arousal-inhibitory ipRGC-
SCN pathway in the nocturnal mouse. In contrast, PKR2
is not expressed in the retinorecipient ventral SCN of
the monkey brain, but strongly expressed in the retinor-
ecipient superficial layer of the SC, and thus the ipRGC-
SC pathway dominates in the diurnal monkey.
The PK2 signaling of the ipRGC-SC pathway is likely to
be stimulatory for the arousal levels. SC has previously
been indicated as a critical nucleus for the light-induced
arousal or other higher brain functions, such as attention,
that are closely tied with increased arousal [42–45]. In the
monkeys, bilateral lesions of the SC have been found to
drastically affect the arousal levels, including response to
light [42]. Lesion studies in rats have revealed that the SC
is required for EEG desynchronization (arousal) in re-
sponse to light flashes [43]. This rat lesion study suggests
that the ipRGC-SC pathway may be stimulatory for the
arousal levels for the nocturnal animals, at least briefly in
response to light flashes. Over a longer duration, light is
inhibitory for the arousal levels of the nocturnal animals
as the inhibitory ipRGC-SCN pathway dominates. In diur-
nal mammals such as monkeys, SC may mediate the light-
driven arousal via the ascending projections to cortices
that are routed through the lateral posterior/Pulvinar
complex of the thalamus [46, 47]. The lateral posterior/
Pulvinar complex of the thalamus is known to play a crit-
ical role for higher function such as attention [48]. In this
regard, wakefulness may be viewed as low level attention.
It is well known that, compared to the nocturnal animals,
the overall size of the SC, the lateral posterior/Pulvinar
complex of the thalamus, and the associated cortices are
all significantly enlarged and expanded in the diurnal
mammalian species, such as the primates [49, 50]. As the
mammalian species are believed to start being nocturnal
[51], diurnality of the mammals may evolve via the expan-
sion of the arousal-stimulatory ipRGC-SC pathway and
the simultaneous diminishment of the arousal-inhibitory
ipRGC-SCN pathway. Our model (Fig. 10) indicates that
the nocturnal/diurnal determination of arousal levels lies
in the upstream of the SCN circadian clock, and divergent
signaling downstream of the SCN clock may not be neces-
sary. The melatonin rhythms, known to lie downstream of
the SCN clock, will operate in the same phase of the SCN
clocks and thus no difference will be exhibited in the noc-
turnal and diurnal mammals. Our model also argues
against the previously presumed central role of SCN as
Fig. 10 Diagram showing the differential arousal regulation by the
PK2 signaling of ipRGC onto brain targets. Clock-controlled PK2 is
expressed in the ipRGC, the only photic channels that transmit central
non-vision functions of light. Overall, the PK2 signaling is stimulatory for
the diurnal monkey and inhibitory for the nocturnal mouse, as shown by
the antagonist blockade and PK2-deficiency. The differential expression
of PKR2 in the retinorecipient ventral SCN and the superficial layer of SC
indicates that the PK2 signaling of the ipRGC dominantly funnels
through ipRGC-SCN and ipRGC-SC for the mouse and the monkey,
respectively. For the nocturnal animals, the arousal stimulation via the
ipRGC-SC pathway by light is minor (transient, not sustained), consistent
with the absence of PKR2 in the SC of the mouse brain. The PK2 signal-
ing of the ipRGC-SCN pathway is clearly inhibitory for the nocturnal
mouse, although it is unclear whether it is inhibitory or stimulatory for
the diurnal animals. SC may mediate the light-driven arousal via the
ascending projections to cortices that are routed through the lateral
posterior/Pulvinar complex of the thalamus. Alternatively, SC may
promote arousal via the descending projections to the mesencephalic
reticular formation, an important component of the ascending activation
system (ref 42–45). Our model indicates that the mammalian diurnal/
nocturnal determination is mediated by the differential signaling of the
ipRGC onto their brain targets, and thus divergent signaling mechanisms
downstream of the SCN may not be necessary. In diurnal animals,
upstream clocks such as the ones in the ipRGC likely play more
dominant roles than the SCN, at least for arousal regulation under light
and dark condition

 the master clock for diurnal mammals, such as monkeys,
at least for the regulation of arousal levels under light and
dark conditions. Although the supporting evidence for the
SCN as the master circadian clock is overwhelmingly
strong for the nocturnal mammals, such claim has actually
limited supporting evidence in the case of the diurnal ani-
mals [8]. The well cited work of increased sleep by the
SCN lesion in squirrel monkeys [52], interpreted as the
arousal-promoting of the SCN for the diurnal animals,
could be due to the concurrent lesions to the retinohy-
pothalamic tract, which would damage projections to both
SCN and SC. Under light and dark condition, it is likely
that the ipRGC play central roles for the regulation of
arousal levels regardless whether the mammals are diurnal
or nocturnal. In nocturnal mammals, ipRGC and SCN act
in sequential neural projections (and with the similar os-
cillatory phase) to regulate arousal levels, thus nocturnal
activity patterns are displayed. In diurnal mammals, the
arousal-stimulatory ipRGC-SC projections overcome the
diminished arousal-inhibitory ipRGC-SCN projections,
and thus diurnal activity patterns are exhibited
Methods
Animals
PK2−/− mice and their littermate wild type controls in
mixed genetic background were generated as described
[29, 31]. Bmal1−/− mice were produced by crossing
from heterozygous mice that were procured from Jack-
son laboratory. Mice were fed at libo and housed at
regular light/dark cycle, with lights (~150 lux white light)
on at 7:00 a.m. (Zeitgeber Time ZT0, light period ZT0-
ZT12) and lights off at 7:00 p.m. (ZT12, dark period
ZT12-ZT0). All animal procedures were approved by ap-
propriate institutional animal use committee.
Measurement and analysis of the locomotor activity in
mice
Monitoring of the locomotor activity was carried out as
described [29]. Briefly, mice were individually housed
with cages equipped with infrared beams for the moni-
toring of the locomotor activity (AccuScan Instrument
Inc. Columbus, OH). Mice were housed at regular 12 h
Light (~150 lux white light): 12 h Dark cycle. The loco-
motor activities were recorded as counts per 10-min
interval and were analyzed in 30 or 60 min pins. Light
pulses or dim light at the indicated intensities were
administered.
Measurement and analysis of the arousal level in mice
Electrodes
for
recording
the
electroencephalographic
(EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) signals were implanted
as described [29, 31]. The mice were connected to a swivel
system
of
tether/commutator
system
(Plastics
One,
Roanoke, VA) for the collection of the EEG/EMG signals.
The EEG/EMG signals were amplified using a Grass
Model 78 (Grass Instruments, West Warwick, RI) and
filtered (EEG: 0.3–100 Hz, EMG: 30–300 Hz) before being
digitized at a sampling rate of 128 Hz, stored on a com-
puter. After sleep data were collected, EEG/EMG records
were scored with SleepSign software sleep scoring system
(Kissei Comtec America, Irvine, CA) as described [31].
Mice were housed at a regular 12 h light/12 h dark cycle.
Light pulses or dim light at the indicated intensities were
administered.
In situ hybridization
Procedures for In situ hybridization were carried out simi-
larly as described [6, 7]. Tissue sections were cut at −20 °C,
and then fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde, followed by
three washes of 0.1 M phosphate buffer, air-dried, and
stored at −20 °C until use. For In situ hybridization, sec-
tions were dried at room temperature, followed by pre-
treatment of proteinase K (1 μg/ml). Sections were then
air-dried and hybridized with S [35]-labelled riboprobes by
incubation at 60 °C for 18 h. After hybridization, tissue sec-
tions were treated with RNAase (20 μg/ml) (Sigma-Al-
drich, St. Louis, MO), decreasing salinity washes and high
stringency (68 °C) wash. After dehydration and air-drying,
tissue sections were exposed to Kodak Biomax film. Images
were captured with image analysis system (MCID, Imaging
Research, Ontario, Canada).
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed according to pre-
vious
publications
[53,
54].
Retinal
sections
were
mounted onto coated glass slides. Sections were rehy-
drated in PBS for 20 min then immersed in a blocking
buffer containing 2 % BSA, 0.5 % Tween-20 and 0.05 %
Triton-X 100 for 1 h. Primary antibody for PK2 (Ham-
ster monoclonal, 1:200, Roche Inc.) or OPN4 (Affinity
purified rabbit polyclonal, 1:200, Millipore Inc.) was
added to the sections overnight at 4 °C. Slides were
washed with PBS containing 0.5 % Tween-20 five times
for 5 min each. Anti-rabbit or anti-hamster secondary
antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 or 555 1:2000; Invitrogen
Inc.) were then applied, followed by incubation with
10 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen Inc) for 5 min at
room temperature to stain the nucleus. Sections were
viewed under a Nikon inverted fluorescence microscope
(Model TE-2000U; Nikon Inc, Tokyo, Japan). Images
were captured with a SPOT digital camera (Diagnostic
Instruments, Inc, Sterling Heights, MI). Immunofluores-
cence intensity was quantified with Image J. For DAB
(3,3′-diaminobenzidine) immunostaining, sections were
incubated with anti-PK2 antibody (Hamster monoclonal,
1:500 dilution) antibody, followed by incubation with
biotinylated
anti-hamster
secondary
antibody.

 development of DAB immunostaining was carried out
with the standard ABC method [52].
Pharmacological experiments of examining the effect of a
PK2 antagonist on the activity or arousal levels in the
mice and the monkeys
A PK2 antagonist (PKR#7) was prepared similarly as
described [55]. PKR#7 (40 mg/kg) was administered to
the mice intraperitoneally at ZT6. PKR#7 (10 mg/kg)
was administered to the monkeys intramuscularly at
ZT10. For the pharmacological experiments, animals
were treated with either the vehicle or antagonist and
then crossed over with the opposite treatments 1 week
later to form paired controls.
Sleep and activity data of the PK2 antagonist or
control-treated mice were acquired and analyzed as de-
scribed for the PK2−/− mice. For the sleep studies of the
monkeys, young adult monkeys (Macaca fascicularis)
were housed under standard light (white light ~250 lux)
and dark cycle. The measurement and analysis of the
arousal levels in the monkey were carried out as follows.
A wearable wireless sleep tracker, similar to described
previously for human subjects [56–59] and for non-
human primates [60], was used. This wireless system
enabled remote monitoring of the sleep/wake status of
the monkeys for an ambulatory setting for a long time
with minimal disturbing of the monkeys. The sleep data
obtained from the wireless sleep tracker were verified
with with concurrent recording of infrared video camera.
The sleep data of the sleep trackers were retrieved daily
with mobile phones that were seated about ten meters
away from the animal cages, without physical contact
with the monkeys. Previous studies have shown excellent
agreement of sleep data obtained by the sleep tracker,
video camera and classical sleep/wake data obtained by
the EEG/EMG method [56, 59, 61].
Statistics
To reduce the impact of data variations due to ultra-
dian rhythms, the measurements of mouse locomotor
activity and EEG/EMG were performed two times that
were separated by 3 or 4 days, and the average values of
these two measurements were used in statistical analyses.
Statistical analyses were performed with 1 or 2 ways
ANOVA by using GraphPad Prism Software Version 5.0
(San Diego, CA), followed by appropriate post tests.
