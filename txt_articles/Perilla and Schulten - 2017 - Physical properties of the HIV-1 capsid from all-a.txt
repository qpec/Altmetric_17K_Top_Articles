Physical properties of the HIV-1 capsid
from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations
Juan R. Perilla1,2 & Klaus Schulten1
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is highly dependent on its capsid. The
capsid is a large container, made of B1,300 proteins with altogether 4 million atoms.
Although the capsid proteins are all identical, they nevertheless arrange themselves into
a largely asymmetric structure made of hexamers and pentamers. The large number of
degrees of freedom and lack of symmetry pose a challenge to studying the chemical details of
the HIV capsid. Simulations of over 64 million atoms for over 1 ms allow us to conduct a
comprehensive study of the chemical–physical properties of an empty HIV-1 capsid, including
its electrostatics, vibrational and acoustic properties, and the effects of solvent (ions and
water) on the capsid. The simulations reveal critical details about the capsid with implications
to biological function.

 T
he family of retroviruses is characterized by their ability
to incorporate viral DNA into a host cell’s genome1,2.
Most retroviruses infect cells during mitosis when the
chromatin is exposed to the cytoplasm1,3. Conversely, the genus
of lentiviruses, like the human immunodeficiency virus type 1
(HIV-1), have evolved to infect nondividing cells. Since the host
cell’s chromatin is protected by the nucleus, the HIV-1 replication
process requires coordination between reverse transcription
of viral RNA and nuclear import3. Viral RNA is encased in
a shell made of the capsid protein CA4–7. Originally thought to
play a trivial role in the infection process, it is now well
established that the viral capsid fulfills several essential functions1.
In particular, capsid involvement in the prevention of innate
sensor triggering8–11, regulation of reverse transcription3,12
and regulation of the nuclear import pathway1,13–15 is of
central importance to the successful infection of a host cell3.
Structurally, CA consists of a single monomer composed of
two independent domains, the C-terminal domain (CTD) and the
N-terminal domain (Fig. 1a)16,17. In solution, CA readily forms
dimers connected by their CTDs16. At higher concentrations of
CA and at high salt concentrations (41 M NaCl), the protein
assembles into elongated tubes5. Such tubes are made of the
hexameric form of CA, arranged in a honeycomb lattice5,17–21.
Assembled HIV-1 capsids are highly asymmetric cone-shaped
structures5,22, with sizes ranging from 100 to 200 nm long and
45 to 50 nm wide (Fig. 1b)1,5,22, that are made of pentamers
and hexamers following Eberhard’s theorem21. The location
of the pentamers induces high curvature and permits the closure
of the capsid4,5,21. Indeed, in the HIV-1 capsid seven pentamers
are located at the base and five pentamers at the tip (Fig. 1b).
The function of a CA monomer is to assemble into a complete
capsid, while the function of the assembled capsid is to infect a
living cell; the chemical–physical properties of the assembled
capsid are essential to elucidating its biological function23–25.
In the present study, the investigation of the chemical–physical
properties of the HIV-1 capsid without genome require the
simulation of an entire virus-like particle (VLP), namely a 1.2 ms,

million
atom

dynamics
(MD)
simulation
(Fig. 1b)5,17,26. Analyses of the trajectory reveal atomic details
as well as global emergent properties of an entire HIV-1 VLP.
In particular, the simulations reveal spontaneous translocation
of water and ions through the capsid core, a molecular process
related to reverse transcription27. Furthermore, analysis of the
electrostatic potential produced by the empty capsid reveals
electrostatic equivalence between the interior and exterior of the
capsid. In addition, analysis of the distribution of ions around
the capsid reveals a binding pattern and specific binding sites
on the capsid for chloride and sodium. Finally, the mechanical
vibrations and normal modes of the empty capsid reveal possible
pathways related to capsid uncoating. Altogether, our findings set
the stage for a better understanding—from an atomic-resolution
perspective—of the emergent properties of the HIV-1 capsid and
their relationships to the infective cycle.
Results
Stability of the HIV-1 capsid. We began our analysis by
assessing the stability of the HIV-1 capsid model, formed by 1,300
copies of the CA, shown in Fig. 1. Stability of the individual
constituents of the capsid, namely CA pentamers and hexamers,
was evaluated by means of root mean squared deviation (r.m.s.d.)
from the starting structure over the course of the simulation
(Fig. 2a). The r.m.s.d. values were calculated excluding parts
of the protein known to be disordered or mobile28, such as
the cyclophilin-A (cypA) binding loop and residues 210 to 220
directly after a-helix 11. The average r.m.s.d. for CA hexamers
and pentamers of 3.5±1.1 Å shows the local stability of the
capsid. Furthermore, the measured r.m.s.d. over the trajectory
for CA pentamers and hexamers of 2.7±0.6 and 3.8±1.0 Å,
respectively, shows that the pentamers are on average more rigid
than the hexamers. Similarly, the variability within the ensemble
of hexamers in the capsid was 3.7±0.9 Å as compared with
2.6±0.5 Å for the 12 pentamers. In addition, the stability of
the capsid as a whole was evaluated by calculating the r.m.s.d.
matrix between pairwise structures over the course of the
trajectory (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Movie 1);
the distance matrix shows that after 400 ns all capsid structures
are within 3.5±1.0 Å of each other.
Changes in the cross-sectional area and height of the capsid are
related to its global stability (Fig. 2b–d). Therefore, both the
height and cross-sectional area were calculated along the three
principal axes of inertia of the capsid (Fig. 2b). Interestingly,
during the first 400 ns of simulation, a shrinking of the capsid was
observed, evidenced by a reduction in both the height and cross-
sectional area at a rate of 0.025 nm ns � 1 and 0.113 nm2 ns � 1,
respectively (Fig. 2b,c). After 400 ns, the capsid height and cross-
section reach a plateau for the remaining 800 ns of the simulation
that is used in the subsequent analyses.
Examination of the water density in the interior and exterior of
the capsid reveals the origin of capsid shrinkage (Supplementary
Fig. 2a). During the first 100 ns of simulation, a decay in water
density was observed inside the capsid, followed by stabilization
around 1.000±0.002 gm cm � 3. Importantly, the rates of water
moving in and out of the capsid are 20.1 � 103±1.6 � 103 and
19.7 � 103±1.5 � 103

(Supplementary Fig. 2b). The transfer rates of water indicate
thermal equilibrium between the interior and exterior of the

all of its contained water in B1 ms. Remarkably, the transfer
rates observed for HIV-1 are in stark contrast with order of

 solvated capsid, that is, explicitly including water and ions,
was calculated at 20 ps intervals over the course of the simulation,
over a grid containing 350 � 353 � 600 bins along the ^
x, ^
y and ^
z
direction, respectively. The resulting electrostatics maps were
averaged over the last 400 ns of simulation. Snapshots of
the electrostatic maps at regular intervals over the trajectory,
averaged over 10 ns of simulation, are presented in Suppleme-
ntary Fig. 3. The time-averaged electrostatic potential is shown
in Fig. 3a,d. Notably, a gradient of up to 7 V is observed between
the CypA binding loop and the inner core of CA (Fig. 3c);
in addition, the innermost layer of the VLP constitutes an
isopotential volume spanning the entire capsid (Fig. 3b).
Intriguingly, the effective electrostatic potential of hexamers and
pentamers is remarkably similar. Furthermore, the regions of
the solvent inside and outside of the capsid are at the same
electrostatic potential as shown in Fig. 3b.
The presence of water and ions in the simulation box offers a
unique view into the interactions between the capsid and its native
environment. Taking advantage of the small variations within each
of the ensembles of hexamers and pentamers, 186 hexamers/12
pentamers were r.m.s. fitted to a common reference; then,
occupancy of chloride and sodium ions was measured over the
last 400 ns of simulation, resulting in a total sampling per hexamer
or pentamer of 186 � 0.4ms ¼ 74.4 ms and 12� 0.4 ms ¼ 4.8 ms,
respectively. The analysis reveals regions of high occupancy for
chloride (cyan) and sodium (yellow) (Fig. 4). Comparison of our
results with published crystal structures show that our observation
of chloride at the centre of the hexameric rings is accurate20.
However, in our simulations, the binding of chloride to other
regions is also detected, in particular assisted by highly conserved
residues K70 and K180 (ref. 30). In addition, we also observe the
presence of sodium near the surface of the capsid at multiple sites,
especially near genetically important residues30 E71, E75, E76, E79,
E212 and E213.
Binding of ions to the whole capsid reveals an interesting
overall pattern (Fig. 4): Chloride ions form an inner layer
adjacent to the surface of the capsid, while sodium binds to the
exterior of the capsid. Examination of the transfer rates for both
ionic species present in the simulation reveal that ions are in
thermal equilibrium between the interior and exterior of the
capsid (Supplementary Fig. 2c,d). Interestingly, over the course of
the simulation, we were able to observe numerous translocation
events of chloride through the central pores in hexamers and
pentamers (Supplementary Movie 2), and sodium through the
pores located between adjacent CTD dimers (Supplementary
Movie 3). Notably, the inwards and outwards transfer rates for
sodium are 9.4±2.4 and 8.5±1.1 molecules per ns, respectively.
In contrast, we observed inwards and outwards transfer rates
twofold that of sodium for chloride, 22.2±2.9 and 20.8±3.3
molecules per ns, respectively.

 At each binding site, ion occupancies are directly related to
the binding free energies of both ionic species31; therefore, from the
occupancy maps, we derived a three-dimensional (3D) potential of
mean force (PMF) for both pentamers and hexamers, as explained
in Methods and shown in Fig. 4. The resulting PMFs illustrate that
irrespective of the oligomeric (hexamer or pentamer) state of CA,
the ion binding pattern is remarkably similar. Nevertheless, the
PMFs show that binding of chloride in the central pore, near R18,
is weaker for hexamers than it is for pentamers, as demonstrated
by their Gibbs free energy DGhex
CLA ¼ � 1.5±0.9 kcal mol � 1 and
DGpent
CLA ¼ � 2.7±1.1 kcal mol� 1, respectively. The difference in
binding energies between pentamers and hexamers suggests that
chloride ions translocate more easily through hexameric channels
than they do through pentameric channels. Similarly, sodium
binding at the hinge region (residues 144 to 148)16 and the
threefold interface between hexamers exhibits a lower affinity,
DGhex
SOD ¼ � 1.8±0.5 kcal mol � 1 compared with chloride in any
other binding site. Remarkably, the free energies of binding for
chloride and sodium ions are similar to the experimentally
measured value for binding of sodium to wild-type thrombin
( � 2.3 kcal mol � 1)32; nonetheless, we find lower values comparing
the free energy of binding of sodium to glutamate receptors
( � 10.0±5.0kcal mol � 1)33,
and
the
sodium
symporter
( � 10.0±2.0kcal mol � 1)34. Overall, the distribution of ions
and exchange rates reveal that the HIV-1 capsid is able to
translocate ions with remarkable specificity; such specificity
may play an important role during infection, as it would assist
and filter translocation of molecules that are key for successful
infection (for example, DNA nucleotides27).

 Acoustic properties of the HIV-1 capsid. Structural fluctuations
of the capsid during the simulation revealed complex dynamics.
Deviations from the equilibrium position of individual Cas were
projected over the capsid for different time points, as described
in Methods (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Movie 4). The projection
of the variations reveals an oscillatory behaviour of the surface
of
the
capsid
with
magnitude
3.0±1.0 Å.
Interestingly,
similar oscillations have been observed for lipid vesicles35. These
‘surface waves’ are spread over the capsid and dynamically
correlate large regions of the capsid (Fig. 5a and Supplementary
Figs 4 and 5).
The capsid is a closed container that can be characterized
based on its acoustic properties. For this purpose, periodograms
were calculated for each Ca time series (Fig. 5b). A periodogram is
the
squared
magnitude
of
the
discrete
Fourier
transform
and identifies the most dominant frequencies in a time series36.
Therefore, the periodograms permit one to identify the most
dominant frequencies in the measured time series for every Ca in
the HIV-1 capsid. Because of the large number of Cas (4150,000,)
analysing the periodograms by visual inspection is impractical.
Instead, by using each periodogram as a descriptor for every
fifth Ca and the Manhattan distance between descriptors as a
similarity score between Cas, every fifth Cas were classified into
clusters using a partition around medoids (PAM) algorithm37.
The silhouette criteria (Supplementary Fig. 6)37 was used to
establish the optimal number of clusters, indicating four of
them (Fig. 5b). The same clustering analysis was performed
for halved and quartered fragments of the simulation that also
resulted in four major clusters (Supplementary Fig. 4).
Remarkably, each of the four clusters identified by the PAM
analysis are dominated by a different fundamental frequency
(Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 4). Indeed, the two largest
clusters (N ¼ 10,743 and N ¼ 11,898) are dominated by the two
lower fundamental frequencies (2.38 and 4.76 MHz); conversely,
the
two
smallest
clusters
(N ¼ 4,679
and
N ¼ 2,786)
are
dominated by two higher fundamental frequencies (7.14 and
11.9 MHz). The clusters were mapped to their locations on the
structure of the capsid (Fig. 5c,d). Interestingly, the highest
frequency cluster (four) is located at the tip of the capsid
and around the circumference of the base. On the other hand,

 lower frequency clusters are located on the large regions spanning
between the base and tip of the capsid.
As previously mentioned, analysis of halved and quartered
fragments of the trajectory reveals that oscillations of the capsid
can still be clustered for shorter lengths of the simulation.
Nonetheless, the mapping of the frequencies on to the capsid
structure identify different
frequency
regions for different
fragments of the simulation (Supplementary Fig. 5). These
differences between frequency-to-structure mappings suggests
that the waves we observe are not stationary. We therefore
conclude that the waves observed behave like capillary waves
common in several types of membranes and fluids35. A remaining
question, beyond the scope of the present study, is the
relationship between capillary waves and permeation of water
and ions through the capsid.
Mechanical modes of the HIV-1 capsid. Normal modes are
informative to elucidate the collective motions of flexible
molecules
that
underlie
changes
in
their
conformation38.
The displacement patterns obtained from normal-mode analysis
(NMA) provide insights into the mechanical nature of biological
nanomachines and can be used to derive conformational
transitions related to biological function39. A common practice
is to extract slow motions from MD trajectories using principal
component analysis (PCA) that reveal principal components
(PCs) akin to normal modes40,41. In the context of viral capsids,
several studies have been performed to extract such collective
motions by using a plethora of methods42–46. Nonetheless, since
all NMA studies of entire viral capsids were performed in
vacuo45, a long-standing question in physical virology is the
influence of hydrodynamic effects resulting from the presence of
solvent in the vibrational modes of viral capsids45.
The vibrational modes of a fully solvated HIV-1 capsid
were obtained in the present study based on all-atom MD
simulations. In particular, PCA was employed by performing
singular value decomposition of the last 400 ns of the trajectory
(described in detail in Methods). The PCs were calculated
using the Ca atoms (N ¼ 150,528), thus resulting in a total
of d ¼ 3 � N � 6 ¼ 451,578 degrees of freedom. Convergence
of the subspace spanned by the PCs was evaluated for different
numbers of modes and lengths of the trajectory using the
mutual similarity measurement40, as explained in Methods
and illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 7. A total of n ¼ 20,000
frames were employed for the PCA calculations. The number of
PCs that can be extracted from the simulation is given by
min(d,n) ¼ 20,000 (ref. 47). Interestingly, 300 modes are required
to account for over 80% of the variance observed in the
simulations (Fig. 6a); similarly, only 100 modes are neessary to
account for over 60% of the variance (Fig. 6a). Projection of the
last 400 ns of the simulation onto the first two PCs further
demonstrates the stability of the capsid (Supplementary Fig. 8).
In addition, for the lowest 800 modes the percentage of the
capsid involved in each mode was quantified using the so-called
participation
number44.
The
participation
number
reveals
that the modes are not localized, and that the PCs involve
large portions of the capsid ranging from 70 to 84% of the
entire capsid (Fig. 6b).
Projection of the displacement patterns of the first and second
PCs (which together contribute 25% of the overall variance)
onto the structure of the capsid reveal complex motions of the
capsid subunits (Fig. 6c,d and Supplementary Fig. 9, respectively).
The motions are represented as vectors in the figures, indicating
the displacement of a given atom. The pattern of the motions
is intriguing, as a belt can be observed that effectively divides
the capsid into two hemispheres, corresponding to the tip and the
base of the cone (Fig. 6d). Additionally, related to the capillary
waves observed in the previous section, vortices are observed in
the motions throughout the structure of the capsid (Fig. 6c,d).
Remarkably, the first 100 PCs reveal the absence of a distinct
radial breathing mode, and show that all modes exhibit a
combination of displacements that imply motion both radially
and within the surface of the capsid. The first 100 PCs are
included in Supplementary Dataset 1 that can be visualized
using the NormalModeWizard available in visual molecular
dynamics (VMD).
Discussion
The HIV-1 capsid is a finely tuned nanodevice that modulates
several molecular events during HIV-1 infective cycle by
interacting with multiple cellular host factors1. The structural
stability of the capsid during different stages of the infective
cycle remains poorly understood. In the present study, despite
observing a global shrinking of the capsid compared with
our original model5, the overall shape of the capsid and the
structure of CA hexamers and pentamers remained largely
unaltered over 1.2 ms of simulation time. Such global and local
stability further supports the fullerenic model of the HIV-1
capsid, as well as the stability of the capsid interfaces, formed
by dimers and hexameric/pentameric rings. Our observation
that a shrinkage of the capsid is followed by a stable structure is
consistent with coarse-grained simulations of HIV-1-like particle
assembly, where a global arrangement of the VLP occurs followed
by local re-arrangement of the VLP structure48,49. In addition,
our results suggest that a closed capsid, irrespective of its
cargo, once assembled, remains stable and closed while still
permitting the passage of water and ions.
So far, acoustic and normal mode analysis for large macro-
molecular systems have been limited to symmetric particles
or coarse-grained representations. In the present study we
determined acoustic properties and PCs from all-atom simula-
tions of a solvated capsid. We found that the capsid exhibits
an oscillatory behaviour manifested as surface waves. Our
analysis indicates that the fundamental frequencies associated
with such waves occur in the ultrasound regime (2.38 to
11.9 MHz). To our surprise, the fundamental frequencies were
associated with different regions of the capsid. Interestingly,
the tip of the capsid, where pentamers are closer to each other,
presents the highest fundamental frequency. In addition, our
NMA results suggest that the capsid exhibits long-range collective
dynamics. Such correlations over long distances may play
important roles during infection, as they permit the capsid
to transfer information to/from distant regions of its structure.
This allosteric communication across the capsid could serve a
function during nuclear import, during which interactions
between the nuclear pore complex and the capsid modulate
infection1 (Supplementary Fig. 10).
A significant result from the present study is the discovery
of binding of cations and anions in genetically important
regions of the assembled capsid. We are not the first group to
observe ions bound to CA in high-order assemblies; in addition
to water molecules, chloride ions were detected by X-ray
crystallography at multiple interfaces of a planar hexameric
lattice (including the central pore, the CTD dimer and the
threefold symmetry axis)20. However, whether chloride or
sodium ions play a biological role is unclear, as they may be

ions

Furthermore, not all of the binding sites we observe have also

 the assembled capsid together with the ion binding sites
could indicate the existence of protein–protein interfaces for
as yet undiscovered cellular factors. Interestingly, the distribution
of charge on the surface of the capsid of another retrovirus,
the Rous sarcoma virus, is essential for successful infection50.
Finally, our observation of ion-specific binding sites could
also explain the requirement for high-salt concentrations for
in vitro assembly of CA tubes and VLPs.
Remarkably, we also observe that ions translocate through
chloride- and sodium-specific channels within the surface of
the capsid. While homeostasis could be a simple explanation for
ion translocation, there are other biological functions of the
capsid that could require the existence of such channels3,29,51,52.
For instance, reverse transcription (which is coupled to capsid
uncoating) requires that DNA nucleotides be able to move
from the exterior to the interior of the capsid3,16,27. Therefore,
it is possible that the channels found within the capsid serve to
translocate small molecules, including nucleotides, necessary
during different stages of the infective cycle.
Importantly,
in
authentic
virions,
deviations
should
be
expected from the distribution of ions and electrostatics presented
here due to the presence of HIV-1 single-stranded RNA and other
proteins in the interior of the capsid. In particular, the native
HIV-1 capsid contains two copies of its negatively charged
B9.7 kb-long genomic RNA53 that likely induces osmotic
and mechanical pressures between the interior and exterior
of the capsid; a similar shift in pressure has also been proposed
for poliovirus capsids29. Remarkably, changes in pressure of the
capsid have been observed during reverse transcription in
time-lapse atomic force microscopy experiments that result in
rupture of the capsid at the narrow end54. In the context
of in vivo cargo, the ions channels identified in the present
study could help regulate the osmotic shock produced during
reverse transcription of the genomic RNA.
The present work is a comprehensive study of the chemical–
physical
properties
of
the
HIV-1
capsid—an
important
therapeutic target. Through the combination of state-of-the-art
MD simulations with scalable, robust and model-free statistical
analysis, we characterized—at atomic resolution—the stability,
electrostatics, water/ions permeability and the dynamic and
acoustic properties of the HIV-1 capsid. Our results may
provide a new avenue for the development of therapeutic
interventions that seek to alter the biophysical properties of
the HIV-1 capsid towards the treatment of disease.
Methods
Molecular dynamics simulations of the HIV-1 capsid. In the present study,
computer simulations were employed to investigate the stability, electrostatics, ion
permeability, acoustics and mechanical properties of the HIV-1 capsid at atomic
resolution. In particular, a 1.2 ms MD trajectory of 64,423,983 atoms probed high
spatial and temporal resolution characteristics of an empty HIV-1 capsid embed-
ded in its native environment. This level of detail is currently inaccessible to
experimental methods alone26,55.
The HIV-1 capsid composed of 186 CA hexamers and 12 CA pentamers was
embedded in a water box with 150 mM sodium chloride, resulting in a simulation
box of dimensions 70 nm � 76 nm � 121 nm and a total of 64,423,983 atoms
(Fig. 1b), as described in a previous publication5 and in Supplementary Note 1. In
particular, the sequence of HIV-1 subtype B, NL4-3 with the A92E mutation5, was
used for all CA monomers. For the present study, MD simulations of the
unrestrained, fully solvated HIV-1 empty capsid were performed using NAMD

 2.10 (refs 56,57) for a total of 1.2 ms. MD simulations were performed on the Oak
Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF) TITAN supercomputer (INCITE
allocation BIO024) using 3880 GPU accelerated Cray-XK nodes; details regarding
the computational challenges of the present simulation are described in
Supplementary Note 2. The CHARMM36 (ref. 58) force field was employed with
the TIP3P59 water model at 310 K and 1 atm. Simulations carried out in the present
study used the r-RESPA integrator available in NAMD. Long-range electrostatic
force calculations employed the particle mesh Ewald method, utilizing a grid
spacing of 2.1 Å and eighth-order interpolation with a 1.2 nm cutoff. The
simulations employed an integration time step of 2 fs, with nonbonded interactions
evaluated every 2 fs and electrostatics updated every 4 fs; all hydrogen bonds were
constrained with the SHAKE algorithm.
Electrostatics and permeability of ions calculations. Analysis of the capsid
electrostatics and ion permeability from the MD trajectories took advantage of
OLCF and National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) Blue Waters
high-performance Lustre filesystem, with a stripe count of 16; details regarding the
performance of the Lustre filesystem for analysis of biomolecular simulations have
been studied by Stone et al.60. Using OLCF Rhea cluster, electrostatic maps were
calculated for the entire system, including protein, water and ions, at intervals of
20 ps over the trajectories, resulting in 20,000 maps. Long-range electrostatic
calculations were performed using the particle-mesh-Ewald method in VMD61,62.
A 3D grid with voxel size of 2 Å was employed for the electrostatics calculations,
resulting in 350 � 343 � 600 bins along the ^
x, ^
y and ^
z direction, respectively. The
20,000 maps were then averaged using volutil in VMD. Ion occupancies were
calculated at 1 Å resolution (700 � 646 � 1,200 bins) using the volmap plugin in
VMD. The occupancy maps were then processed with volutil in VMD to calculate
the Gibbs free energy of binding using W ~

(explained in detail by Cohen et al.31).
Density and exchange rates of water and ions. To distinguish between the
interior versus exterior of the capsid, a 3D ray-tracing method based on the digital
differential analysis algorithm63 was written in C þ þ and implemented in VMD.
A grid with the same dimensions as the simulation box was created for each frame
of the trajectory. To identify the regions of the grid occupied by the protein, the
molecular surface of the capsid was calculated using the QuickSurf algorithm in
VMD, yielding a continuous surface without holes. Subsequentely, for each voxel in
the grid, six rays were cast in the � ^
x, �^
y and �^
z direction, respetively. If any of
the rays hit the external wall of the grid, the voxel was considered to be outside of
the capsid; conversely, if none of the rays hit an external wall, the voxel was
considered to be inside of the capsid. Voxels assigned to the protein were not
evaluated using the digital differential analysis algorithm and were classified as
protein voxels. Using the classification of each voxel, atoms within a voxel were
labelled as belonging to the inside, outside or protein bound. A grid length
of 2.0 Å was employed for all calculations. Water density was calculated
using the relationship64, r¼

ð Þ, where Mw is the molecular weight
of TIP3P water (18.016 g mol � 1)64, V is the volume of the region of interest in (Å3)
and N is the number of particles in contained the given region.
Exchange rates for water and ions were calculated from the number of
molecules that were located on one side of the capsid surface at a reference
frame t0 and found on the opposite side of the surface at a later frame t4t0
(ref. 29). The reference frame was selected at different intervals to minimize the
effects of molecule recrossing through the boundary of the capsid (Supplementary
Fig. 2). Analysis of the densities and exchange rates from the MD trajectories took
advantage of NCSA Blue Waters high-performance Lustre filesystem, with a stripe
count of 120. Trajectories were analysed in parallel with a load of 12 frames per
compute node.
Determination of acoustic properties. First, a reference structure for the capsid
was determined using the statistical package R65 as follows. The similarity matrix
containing pairwise r.m.s.d. between every time frame of the capsid simulation for
the last 400 ns of simulation was generated (using Cas); r.m.s.d. was calculated
using the Kabsh algorithm66. The parallel implementation of the partition around
medoids PAM algorithm available in the SPRINT package37,67 was utilized to
determine the structural medoid of the capsid. Medoids are representative
structures observed during the simulation, whose average similarity to all other
frames in a trajectory is minimal. Medoids are similar in concept to the mean
structure, yet have the advantage of being physical structures, as they are always
members of the trajectory. With the medoid as the reference structure, the
normalized radial fluctuations for every Ca atom was calculated as
dxiðtÞ¼ ~

k

, where i ¼ 1yNCa. Subsequentely, periodograms were
calculated using R for every fifth Ca (Fig. 5b). A periodogram is the squared
magnitude of the discrete Fourier transform and identifies the most dominant
frequencies in a time series36. Periodograms were then clustered using the
Manhattan distance as a similarity score and employing the parallel PAM
algorithm in SPRINT37,67. The silhouette criteria37 were evaluated for 2 to
200 clusters, indicating an optimal partioning of the data into four clusters
(Supplementary Fig. 6).
Analysis of collective motions. The MD trajectory can be written as a
matrix X¼ X1 X2 � � � Xn

the number of cartesian coordinates for all Cas, and n ¼ 20,000 is the total

by the vector X¼ 1

Sdiag is the diagonal matrix with entries s2
j obtained from the covariance
matrix S. Subsequentely, PCA was performed by calculating the singular value
decomposition47 of the scaled-centred trajectory XS by means of the thick-restart
Lanczos algorithm68 in R. In particular, singular value decomposition calculates
the r ¼ min(d, n) eigenvalues l1yr and eigenvectors/PCs Zi(l) of the
covariance matrix S.
The resulting Zi(l) PCs and their associated eigenvalues l were analysed as
follows. The cummulative contribution to variance from the first k PCs was
calculated using47 WðkÞ¼

Þ is the entropy
(information) of the PC. The probabilites pi(l) are the squared component
of the normalized relative displacements for each atom/direction i, pi(l) ¼ |Zi(l)|2
(ref. 44). A PC equally distributed over every atom results in a participation
number equal to the number of atoms in the system. Conversely, small values of
the participation number indicate that the PC is not global44.
Convergence of the subspace spanned by PCs was evaluated using the
mutual similarity measurement40. Mutual similarity was evaluated using the

PCA subspaces is a number between 0 and 1. To evaluate the convergence of the
PCA subspaces, PCs were calculated for trajectory fragments of different size,
ranging from 50 to 200 ns. Subsequently, mutual similarities, using 10 to 1,000 PCs,
were calculated between fragments using R and plotted as a function of fragment
size (Supplementary Fig. 7).
