 Hepatitis B Cure: From Discovery
to Regulatory Approval
Anna S. Lok,1 Fabien Zoulim,2 Geoffrey Dusheiko,3 and Marc G. Ghany4
The majority of persons currently treated for chronic hepatitis B require long-term or lifelong therapy. New inhibitors of hep-
atitis B virus entry, replication, assembly, or secretion and immune modulatory therapies are in development. The introduc-
tion of these novel compounds for chronic hepatitis B necessitates a standardized appraisal of the efficacy and safety of these
treatments and definitions of new or additional endpoints to inform clinical trials. To move the field forward and to expedite
the pathway from discovery to regulatory approval, a workshop with key stakeholders was held in September 2016 to develop a
consensus on treatment endpoints to guide the design of clinical trials aimed at hepatitis B cure. The consensus reached was
that a complete sterilizing cure, i.e., viral eradication from the host, is unlikely to be feasible. Instead, a functional cure charac-
terized by sustained loss of hepatitis B surface antigen with or without hepatitis B surface antibody seroconversion, which is
associated with improved clinical outcomes, in a higher proportion of patients than is currently achieved with existing treat-
ments is a feasible goal. Development of standardized assays for novel biomarkers toward better defining hepatitis B virus cure
should occur in parallel with development of novel antiviral and immune modulatory therapies such that approval of new
treatments can be linked to the approval of new diagnostic assays used to measure efficacy or to predict response. Combination
of antiviral and immune modulatory therapies will likely be needed to achieve functional hepatitis B virus cure. Limited proof-
of-concept monotherapy studies to evaluate safety and antiviral activity should be conducted prior to proceeding to combina-
tion therapies. The safety of any new curative therapies will be paramount given the excellent safety of currently approved
nucleos(t)ide analogues. (HEPATOLOGY 2017;66:1296-1313).
T
he advent of several novel antiviral and
immune modulatory therapies for chronic
hepatitis B now necessitates a standardized
appraisal of the efficacy and safety of these therapies,
and definitions of new or additional endpoints to
inform clinical trials. To move the field forward, and
to expedite the pathway from discovery to regulatory
approval, the American Association for the Study of
Liver Diseases and the European Association for the
Study of the Liver jointly organized the Hepatitis B
Treatment Endpoints Workshop on September 8-9,
2016, in Alexandria, Virginia. The primary goal of this
workshop was to assemble key stakeholders from regu-
latory agencies (US Food and Drug Administration
and European Medicines Agency), biopharmaceutical
and biotechnology companies engaged in development
of diagnostic tests and therapeutic agents for hepatitis
B, and academia in order to develop a consensus on
treatment endpoints to guide the design of clinical tri-
als aimed at hepatitis B cure.

MERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR
 Sixty-six (33%) of 202 participants completed a pre-
meeting survey, including 4 from regulatory agencies,
31 from industry, 28 from academia, and 3 from other
health care sectors. During the workshop, experts
reviewed the natural history of chronic hepatitis B virus
(HBV) infection, efficacy of currently approved treat-
ments, potential antiviral targets and approaches to
restore immune responsiveness to HBV, and preclini-
cal and early-phase clinical trial data on novel antiviral
and immune modulatory therapies for chronic HBV.
The workshop concluded with a session on the defini-
tion of HBV cure; efficacy endpoints, safety assess-
ments, target populations, and design of clinical trials;
and diagnostic assays needed to support development
of curative therapies. These topics were further dis-
cussed during a closed session involving 23 experts
(including the 4 authors) representing all constituent
groups. This report summarizes the discussions and
consensus opinions of the 2-day meeting.
Definition of HBV Cure
The goal of developing new therapies is to achieve
HBV cure, i.e., elimination of HBV, thereby allowing
treatment to be stopped with no risk of virological
relapse and no risk of liver disease progression. How-
ever, a true cure may not be feasible because HBV
DNA is integrated into the host genome; even among
persons who have recovered from acute HBV, viral
covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) can be
detected in the liver, explaining the reactivation of
HBV replication when these “recovered” persons are
profoundly immunosuppressed. However, the observa-
tion that hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) may
become undetectable in serum after clinical recovery
from acute hepatitis B, spontaneously during the
course of chronic HBV infection, and during or after
nucleosid(t)e analogue (NA) or interferon (IFN) ther-
apy, despite the likelihood of persistent integrated
HBV genomes, argues for the feasibility of achieving
undetectable levels of HBsAg.
A key objective of the meeting was to establish a
definition of cure. Three definitions of HBV cure were
proposed at this meeting: (1) complete sterilizing cure
with undetectable HBsAg in serum and eradication of
HBV DNA including intrahepatic cccDNA and inte-
grated HBV DNA; (2) functional cure with sustained,
undetectable HBsAg and HBV DNA in serum with
or without seroconversion to hepatitis B surface anti-
body (anti-HBs) after completion of a finite course of
treatment, resolution of residual liver injury, and a
decrease in risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
over time (several levels of functional cure including
complete shutdown of cccDNA transcription, elimina-
tion of cccDNA, complete resolution of liver damage,
and elimination of risk of HCC were discussed); (3)
partial cure with detectable HBsAg but persistently
undetectable HBV DNA in serum after completion of
a finite course of treatment.
The vast majority (87.9%) of survey respondents
selected functional cure (sustained HBsAg loss) as the
goal for new HBV therapies. This selection was
endorsed by other participants and the expert panel as
a feasible goal. In addition, functional cure offers sev-
eral other advantages: it is easy to assess and tests are
widely available, it is associated with improved clinical
outcomes and lower rates of disease reactivation, and
once achieved, there is no further requirement for
therapy.
There was less consensus regarding the necessity of
achieving anti-HBs seroconversion because it is un-
clear whether durability of HBsAg loss and clinical
benefits of HBsAg loss are dependent on the develop-
ment of anti-HBs. Importantly, few of the participants
believed elimination of cccDNA was a mandatory

 criterion for functional cure, and less than half required
that cccDNA be rendered transcriptionally inactive,
reflecting uncertainties over whether new therapies in
development can silence or clear cccDNA, as well as
pragmatic difficulties in measuring cccDNA.
Some members of the expert panel considered par-
tial cure (sustained suppression of HBV replication off
treatment but persistent presence of HBsAg) an
acceptable intermediary step toward functional cure
because partial cure is more achievable in the short
term, has been shown to lead to a reduction in clinical
outcomes,(1) and could expedite drug development.
Natural History of Chronic
HBV Infection
The natural history of chronic HBV infection is var-
iable and dependent on a complex interplay between
the host immune response and the virus. Chronic
HBV infection comprises four phases defined by three
clinical parameters: serum alanine aminotransferase
(ALT) concentrations, serum HBV DNA levels, and
hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) status (Fig. 1). The first
phase is characterized by the presence of HBeAg and
high serum HBV DNA but normal ALT levels. It has
been called the “immune-tolerant” phase, though
recent studies have challenged the concept of immune
tolerance. HBV-specific T-cell responses have been
observed in patients in the immune-tolerant phase
with similar frequency as in patients in the immune-
active phase. This finding has led some to propose that
the immune response is better characterized as low
inflammatory during the immune-tolerant phase (as
opposed to inflammatory during the immune-active
phase).(2-4) The immune-tolerant phase is followed by
the “HBeAg-positive immune-active” phase, when
ALT levels become elevated. After varying intervals,
seroconversion from HBeAg to hepatitis B e antibody
occurs, and a majority of patients transition to the
“inactive carrier” phase, during which ALT levels
return to normal and serum HBV DNA levels are low
or undetectable. In some patients, serum HBV DNA
and ALT levels become elevated again, after years or
decades. These patients are considered to be in the
“HBeAg-negative immune-active” phase, which is
characterized by fluctuating HBV DNA and ALT
levels. The annual incidence of HBeAg-negative
immune-active hepatitis among inactive carriers is esti-
mated to be 0.37%.(5) Some patients do not fit into
any of these conventional phases. Serum HBsAg levels
are highest during the immune-tolerant phase and
lowest during the inactive carrier phase. Consequently,
quantification of serum HBsAg levels may help in
determining the phase of infection, particularly for
HBeAg-negative persons,(6) and to predict the risk of
disease progression and HCC in HBeAg-negative
patients with low viremia (HBV DNA <2,000 IU/
mL).(7) Because phases of chronic HBV infection are
defined based on clinical and not immunologic mea-
sures, the recent European Association for the Study
of Liver Diseases proposed to describe these four
phases as phases 1, 2, 3, and 4.(8) Patients in phases 1
and 2 would be HBeAg-positive, those in phases 3
and 4 would be HBeAg-negative, those with inactive
disease (phases 1 and 3) would be considered to have
chronic infection, while those with active disease
(phases 2 and 4) would be considered to have chronic
hepatitis.
Some patients spontaneously clear HBsAg, but this
event is rare, occurring at a rate of 0.5%-1% per year.
These patients remain positive for hepatitis B core
antibody, and some may develop anti-HBs. The

HBeAg-positive, high serum HBV DNA but normal ALT lev-
els; immune clearance/HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis: HBeAg-
positive, high serum HBV DNA and elevated ALT levels,
HBeAg seroconversion to hepatitis B e antibody occurs after
varying duration; inactive carrier: HBeAg-negative, serum HBV
DNA low (generally <2000 IU/mL) or undetectable; reactiva-
tion/HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis: HBeAg-negative, elevated
levels of HBV DNA and ALT in serum, HBV precore and/or
basal core promoter variant often present. Traditionally phases of
chronic HBV infection are defined by HBeAg status, serum
HBV DNA, and ALT levels. Quantitative HBsAg levels are dif-
ferent in each phase and are generally highest in the immune-
tolerant phase and lowest in the inactive carrier phase. While
most patients progress from one phase to the next, not all
patients go through each phase, and reversion to an earlier phase
can occur.

 majority of patients who clear HBsAg have undetect-
able HBV DNA in serum, but HBV DNA persists in
the serum in some and in the liver in all patients. These
patients are considered to have occult HBV infection.
While the risk of cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease
is greatly diminished, the risk of HCC after HBsAg
loss remains substantial, particularly if HBsAg loss
occurred after the age of 50 or after development of cir-
rhosis.(9-11) Importantly, HBV can be reactivated upon
immunosuppression, suggesting that eradication of
HBV from the host is rarely achieved.(12)
Identifying individuals at greatest risk for develop-
ment of cirrhosis and HCC is an important goal in the
management of chronic HBV infection. Recent studies
have highlighted the importance of viral load in pre-
dicting risk of cirrhosis and HCC.(13,14) However,
many other host (sex, age, family history of HCC, obe-
sity, diabetes), viral (HBV genotype and variants, coin-
fection with other viruses: hepatitis C, hepatitis D,
human immunodeficiency virus), and environmental
(alcohol, smoking, carcinogens) factors contribute to
liver disease progression.
Several risk models have been developed to predict
risk of HCC.(15-19) Most of these models were derived
from data on Asians. The applicability of these models
to all racial/ethnic groups and HBV genotypes,
patients with or without cirrhosis, and untreated
patients as well as those receiving antiviral therapy has
not been confirmed. Cirrhosis is the major risk factor
for HCC. In the past decade, noninvasive assess-
ment—serum marker panels and liver stiffness meas-
urements—have largely replaced liver biopsies in
staging of liver fibrosis. These noninvasive tests have
also been shown to predict survival and HCC in
patients with chronic HBV infection because they have
high accuracy in diagnosing cirrhosis.(20-24)
Current Status of HBV
Treatment
GOALS OF TREATMENT
AND EFFICACY ASSESSMENT
The goals of HBV therapy are to prevent the devel-
opment of cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, HCC,
and death from HBV-related liver disease. The even-
tual clinical outcomes of chronic hepatitis B require
years, if not decades, of surveillance; therefore, bio-
chemical (normalization of ALT), virological (suppres-
sion of serum HBV DNA), serological (HBeAg and/
or HBsAg loss with or without seroconversion to hep-
atitis B e antibody and anti-HBs), and histological
(decrease in hepatic necroinflammation with or with-
out improvement in fibrosis) markers have been used
as surrogates for clinical outcomes—cirrhosis, hepatic
decompensation, HCC, and HBV-related mortality—
and to assess indications for treatment, response, and
prognosis. The durability of responses after treatment
discontinuation is variable.
INDICATIONS FOR TREATMENT
The decision to treat is based upon clinical assess-
ment of the risk of disease progression, which is related
to phase of disease. This risk assessment is based pri-
marily on HBV DNA and ALT levels and the stage of
disease, as assessed by liver biopsy or noninvasive staging
of hepatic fibrosis. Current guidelines recommend treat-
ment for patients with cirrhosis or decompensated liver
disease and, for patients without cirrhosis, evidence of
modest to high viremia and biochemical or histological
evidence of hepatic necroinflammation.(25-27) Contin-
ued high levels of HBV replication together with
hepatic inflammation increases the risk of cirrhosis and
HCC; however, currently available therapies have lower
efficacy in patients in the immune-tolerant phase, and
treatment is not recommended for these patients.(28,29)
APPROVED THERAPIES
Two classes of antiviral therapies have been app-
roved for treatment of hepatitis B: IFNs and NAs. An
advantage of IFN is that it results in higher rates of
HBeAg and HBsAg loss (particularly in patients with
genotype A infection) compared to NAs. Pegylated
IFN administered for 48-52 weeks results in HBeAg
seroconversion in 24%-27% and HBsAg loss in 3%-
7% of patients compared to 12%-22% HBeAg loss and
0%-3% HBsAg loss after the same duration of NA
therapy.(30) Response to IFN is also more durable, and
HBeAg and HBsAg loss may occur after cessation of
treatment, while virological relapse, even after HBV
DNA has become undetectable, is frequent after cessa-
tion of NA.(31) However, IFN is less effective at sup-
pressing viral replication compared to NAs, requires
parenteral administration, is associated with numerous
adverse effects, and is contraindicated in patients with
decompensated cirrhosis or severe exacerbations of
hepatitis and those with autoimmune or psychiatric ill-
nesses. NAs are administered orally and have negligi-
ble adverse effects. The recommended first-line NAs,

 entecavir and tenofovir, have low risk of drug resis-
tance; but the requirement for indefinite therapy in the
majority increases the cost and the risk of nonadher-
ence and adverse effects.
Various combinations of IFN and NA have been
evaluated, but most studies have not shown an added
benefit compared to monotherapy. A recent study
showed that combination of pegylated IFN and teno-
fovir increased the rate of HBsAg loss to 9% at week
72, but the benefit was mainly observed in patients
with genotype A.(32) Therefore, there is an urgent need
to develop new therapies for HBV that can result in
durable suppression of HBV replication and an ensu-
ing decrease in hepatic inflammation and fibrosis after
a finite course of therapy. In addition, more research is
needed to identify which patients can safely stop ther-
apy. Importantly HBsAg loss at an older age and after
the development of cirrhosis does not eliminate the
risk of HCC; however, the benefit of further treatment
for preventing HCC has not been proven.(33) Treat-
ment that can result in a functional cure at an earlier
stage of disease might have a greater impact in prevent-
ing HCC.
LACK OF IMPACT OF NAs
ON cccDNA
A major hurdle to HBV “cure” is the presence of
cccDNA in the hepatocyte nucleus in a nonintegrated
form or episome. cccDNA serves as the template for
transcription of all viral RNAs including pregenomic
RNA (pgRNA) and thus plays a key role in the viral
life cycle. There are two sources of cccDNA: incoming
virions and recycling of encapsidated DNA from the
hepatocyte cytoplasm. The half-life of cccDNA is
long, thus explaining why it is difficult to cure HBV
infection and why HBV can reactivate either spontane-
ously or following immune suppression, many years
after clearance of HBsAg. Chain terminating NAs
block the reverse transcription of pgRNA to HBV
DNA, but they have a marginal effect on cccDNA
production, stability, or transcription. Continued tran-
scription from cccDNA and integrated viral genomes
may explain the relatively minor decrease in serum
HBsAg levels during NA therapy despite undetectable
serum HBV DNA levels.(34) Unfortunately, current
assays for circulating HBsAg cannot distinguish the
transcription of HBsAg from cccDNA versus inte-
grated HBV DNA.
IMPACT OF ANTIVIRAL
TREATMENT ON CLINICAL
OUTCOMES
Most, but not all, long-term follow-up studies and
meta-analyses indicate that IFN and NA treatment
decrease the risk of HCC and liver-related mortal-
ity.(35) A landmark randomized controlled trial showed
that the first-generation NA lamivudine decreased the
risk of disease progression and HCC in patients with
advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis and high viremia.(1) Sev-
eral studies have shown that maintained viral suppres-
sion during NA therapy is associated with regression
of fibrosis, reversal of cirrhosis, and reduction in rates
of hepatic decompensation.(36,37) The risk of HCC is
also diminished, although not eliminated, making it
the only major complication during NA treatment.
The observed reduction in the incidence of HCC
appears to be more evident in persons with cirrhosis
and after several years of continued treatment.(35)
Novel Antiviral Therapies
Recent major scientific discoveries have allowed a
better understanding of the HBV life cycle, including
identification of the cellular receptor for HBV entry,
information on the key nuclear enzymes involved in
cccDNA formation and on its epigenetic control, the
observation of partial cccDNA degradation induced by
IFN or nuclear factor-jB signaling pathways, and
identification of the role of the hepatitis B x protein
(HBx) in HBV transcription. Improved cellular and
animal models have also enhanced the in vitro and in
vivo assessment of the antiviral activity of novel com-
pounds and their potential toxicity. These major
advances in hepatitis B basic research have paved the
way for the identification of multiple new therapeutic
targets (Fig. 2), essential progress toward a “cure” for
hepatitis B. A list of novel antiviral therapies tested in
clinical trials is provided in Supporting Table S1.
HBV ENTRY INHIBITORS
The pathway by which HBV enters hepatocytes
involves virus attachment to heparan sulfate proteogly-
cans, allowing the binding of HBV pre-S1 to human
sodium
taurocholate
cotransporting
polypeptide
(NTCP), followed by membrane fusion and nucleo-
capsid release in the cytoplasm of infected cells.
Entry inhibitors can be classified according to their
modes of action. (1) Neutralizing antibodies target the

 antigenic loop of HBV S-domain or N-terminal epito-
pes in the pre-S1 domain. These antibodies are highly
specific but require parenteral administration, and large
quantities of antibodies are necessary to neutralize circu-
lating subviral envelope particles. (2) Attachment inhib-
itors are negatively or positively charged drugs that bind
the virus (e.g., heparin) or cellular heparan sulfate pro-
teoglycans (e.g., poly-L-lysine). They are efficient but
not specific. (3) Substrates of NTCP include conjugated
bile salts (e.g., taurocholate, ezetimibe) and other small
molecules that are transported by NTCP; the require-
ment for high concentrations and short half-time at the
receptor limit their clinical application. (4) Irreversible
NTCP inhibitors: myrcludex B (myristoylated pre-S1
peptide), cyclosporin A, and derivatives are allosteric
inhibitors of NTCP. They irreversibly block receptor
function at nonsaturating concentrations and have long
half-time at the receptor, but they can block transport
of bile salts and other NTCP substrates at higher
concentrations.

 Entry inhibitors may prevent de novo cccDNA for-
mation in noninfected hepatocytes and might be more
effective at preventing mother-to-child transmission or
reinfection after liver transplantation than at eliminat-
ing HBV in chronically infected persons.
Clinical trials of myrcludex B with or without pegy-
lated IFN in chronic HBV and chronic hepatitis D
virus infection are under way.(38,39)
TARGETING cccDNA
Damage and Destruction
A number of studies demonstrate that it might be pos-
sible to target cccDNA despite its location in the pro-
tected sanctuary of the hepatocyte nucleus. Studies in
cultured hepatocytes showed that several cytokines (IFN-
a, lymphotoxin-b receptor agonists, IFN-c, and tumor
necrosis factor-a) can modulate pathways leading to the
up-regulation of APOBEC3A/B deaminases, which in
turn induced nonhepatotoxic degradation of cccDNA.
However, only partial degradation was achieved in these
tissue culture studies.(40) DNA cleavage enzymes, includ-
ing homing endonucleases or meganucleases, zinc-finger
nucleases,
TAL
effector
nucleases,
and
CRISPR-
associated (cas) nucleases, specifically targeting cccDNA
are being explored in experimental models.(41) Some
studies suggest that editing of HBV DNA by CRISPR-
associated (cas) nuclease cleavage is more efficient than
APOBEC-mediated
cytosine
deamination
following
treatment of infected cells with IFN.(42) Efficient delivery
of these gene editing approaches to HBV-infected hepa-
tocytes without unintended off-target effects will need to
be addressed before they can be tested in clinical trials.
Functional Silencing
Viral cccDNA is organized into a chromatin-like
structure and is subject to epigenetic regulation.(43)
Epigenome modifiers can potentially block cccDNA
transcriptional activity and shut down viral protein
expression; however, if not specific, they may induce
harmful effects on host cells. Some cytokines, includ-
ing IFN-a, have been shown to decrease cccDNA
transcription through epigenetic modifications in pre-
clinical models.(44) HBx has been shown to be required
for cccDNA transcription and viral replication through
degradation of the Smc5/6 restriction factor; thus,
HBx may be an attractive viral target to silence not
only cccDNA transcription(45) but also several other
HBx-dependent,
virus-related
cellular
interactions.
Current assays to detect cccDNA lack specificity, and
a
standardized
method
to
measure
cccDNA
or
cccDNA transcription is needed.
TARGETING VIRAL
TRANSCRIPTS
The use of RNA interference to inhibit replication
of HBV has been extensively evaluated in vitro and
validated in animal models. Small interfering RNA
(siRNA) can be designed to target any viral transcript
and induce its degradation by the RISC/Ago2 com-
plex, resulting in gene silencing. The potential limita-
tions are the need for intravenous administration, the
risk of off-target binding, the potential toxicity of the
vehicle, and the risk of immune activation by pattern
recognition receptors. Three siRNA formulations with
different modes of delivery are under preclinical evalu-
ation and/or early-phase clinical trial. Preliminary
results of a phase 2 trial showed that a single dose of
ARC-520 in combination with entecavir resulted in a
profound and durable decrease in serum HBV DNA
in both HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients
and a decrease in HBsAg level in HBeAg-positive, but
not in HBeAg-negative, patients.(46,47) The siRNAs
were designed to target the cotermini of all transcripts
from cccDNA, and the lack of effect on HBsAg level
in HBeAg-negative patients was postulated to be due
to altered viral transcript sequences derived from inte-
grated HBV DNA. Further studies are needed to
determine whether the decline in HBsAg production
alone might be sufficient to restore HBV-specific T-
cell response or if addition of other antiviral or immune
modulatory therapies is needed.
Antisense oligonucleotides targeting viral transcripts
can block viral protein expression through steric block-
ade of protein translation and/or RNA degradation by
ribonuclease H cleavage. In vitro and in vivo preclini-
cal evaluations have shown their potential to inhibit
viral replication and decrease viral antigen load, but
optimal delivery remains a challenge.
NUCLEOCAPSID ASSEMBLY
AND pgRNA PACKAGING
Nucleocapsid
formation
and
packaging
of
the
pgRNA (the template for viral replication) are critical
steps of the viral life cycle. Therefore, developing
inhibitors or modulators of this process is an attractive
therapeutic approach. The HBV core protein is in-
volved in many aspects of the viral life cycle including
transport of viral genome to the nucleus, uncoating to

 release relaxed circular DNA in the nucleus, packaging
of polymerase protein and pgRNA, capsid assembly,
modulation of reverse transcription, and interaction
with envelope proteins for virus assembly. It may have
additional functions including modulation of cccDNA
chromatin and stability, nuclear export of viral RNAs,
and modulation of innate immunity.
The HBV precore/core protein has recently emerged
as a promising direct antiviral target. With the knowl-
edge of the three-dimensional structure of the core
protein, several classes of non-nucleoside small mole-
cules called core protein assembly modulators have been
developed, including phenylpropenamide and hetero-
aryldihydropyrimidine derivatives. These molecules
can strengthen protein–protein interaction, inhibit
pgRNA encapsidation, and block plus strand DNA
synthesis.(48,49) Results of the first dose-ranging phase
1b study of NVR3-778 showed a decline in serum
HBV DNA, HBV RNA, and HBsAg, with more
pronounced effect when combined with pegylated
IFN.(50)
TARGETING HBsAg
Strategies inhibiting viral gene expression either
through cccDNA transcription or viral mRNA transla-
tion can decrease serum HBsAg levels. Owing to the
large amount of circulating HBsAg in persons with
chronic HBV infection, monoclonal antibodies aimed
at neutralizing and/or depleting HBsAg from the
bloodstream are unlikely to be effective unless used in
combination with other approaches.
Nucleic acid polymers have been shown to decrease
secreted HBsAg, through as yet unknown mecha-
nisms. Clinical trials of REP 2055 and REP 2139
used in monotherapy followed by combination with
pegylated IFN or thymosin alpha-1 induced a marked
decline in circulating HBsAg levels and viremia and
anti-HBs seroconversion in some patients.(51) Similar
results were observed in pilot studies of tenofovir and
pegylated IFN in combination with REP 2139 or
REP 2165.(52) These results need to be replicated in
larger studies, and the potential for cytotoxicity

Immune Response to HBV
and Implications for
Immune Modulatory
Therapies
An
orchestrated
innate
and
adaptive
immune
response is necessary to sense and control HBV infec-
tion.
The
induction
of
innate
proinflammatory
responses and cytokine activation are weak in chronic
HBV infection.(53) IFN-c production from natural
killer cells is detectable in acute hepatitis but deficient
in chronic hepatitis. HBV-specific T cells necessary for
HBV control (which may also play a role in hepatic
inflammation) are dysfunctional and may be depleted
or deleted in chronic HBV.(54,55) Their exhausted phe-
notype has been attributed to persistent antigen expo-
sure and increased expression of T-cell inhibitory
responses,(3,53,56) providing the basis for the focus on
reducing HBsAg production. B-cell dysfunction in
chronic hepatitis B is less well characterized, though
the high rate of HBV reactivation in patients receiving
anti–cluster of differentiation 20 suggests that B cells
play a role in immune control of chronic HBV.
Accordingly, several potential target mechanisms for
immune modulation to engender or restore HBV-
specific immune responses in conjunction with pro-
found inhibition of HBV replication and HBsAg pro-
duction to attain immunological control have been
suggested (Fig. 3). The main concerns of immune
modulatory therapy are the induction of uncontrolled
hepatitis flares and autoimmunity.
INTERFERONS
IFN-a has been used to treat chronic HBV and
chronic hepatitis D virus. IFN-a induces expression of
IFN-sensitive genes encoding intracellular or secreted
effector proteins with antiviral properties. Recent stud-
ies have shown that IFN-a also inhibits pgRNA
encapsidation, enhances cccDNA degradation, and
exerts epigenetic modification of cccDNA trans-
cription.(40,57) Response to IFN-a (HBeAg sero-
conversion) is durable in >70% of patients.(58,59)
Understanding the mechanisms for IFN nonrespon-
siveness and the higher rates of response in genotype A
infection could lead to new targets for antiviral and/or
immune modulatory therapies.
PATHOGEN RECOGNITION
RECEPTORS
Pathogen recognition receptors are an important
gateway to sensing by the innate immune system.
Pharmacological activation of the intrahepatic innate
immune response with toll-like receptor 7, 8, or 9 has
been studied. GS-9620, an oral agonist of toll-like
receptor 7, induced a decline in serum HBV DNA and
HBsAg levels as well as hepatic HBV DNA in HBV-
infected chimpanzees.(60) Similar effects were also
observed in woodchucks(61) but not in humans.(62,63)
The discrepancies between results in animal models
and humans highlight the importance of testing new
therapies in humans at an early stage in drug
development.
STIMULATOR OF IFN GENE
AGONISTS
Stimulator of IFN gene is the adapter protein of
multiple cytoplasmic DNA receptors and a pathogen
recognition receptor recognizing bacterial second mes-
senger and may be a potential target of pharmacologic
activation of the innate immune response.(64) Stimula-
tor of interferon gene agonists can also be used as adju-
vants
to
therapeutic
vaccination.
Retinoic
acid–
inducible protein 1 has been shown not only to induce
IFN and cytokine production but also to inhibit HBV
replication through sensing of the epsilon structure of
pgRNA.(65) SB 9200, an oral prodrug of the dinucleo-
tide SB 9000, is thought to activate retinoic acid–
inducible protein 1 and nucleotide-binding oligomeri-
zation domain–containing protein 2, resulting in IFN-
mediated antiviral immune responses in virus-infected
cells and decreased serum woodchuck hepatitis virus
DNA and surface antigen levels.(66) Clinical trials are
ongoing.
CHECKPOINT MODULATION
The lack of a T cell–mediated response in chronic
HBV is partly due to overexpression of coinhibitory
receptors including programmed cell death, cytotoxic
T lymphocyte–associated antigen-4 lymphocyte activa-
tion gene, and mucin domain to impair T-cell effector
function. T-cell function may also be impaired by
immunosuppressive cytokines including interleukin 10.
LOK ET AL.
HEPATOLOGY, October 2017
1304
 Recent cancer therapies have indicated the potential of
blockade of these coinhibitory receptors with anti-
bodies. Such inhibition may reverse immune dysfunc-
tion in hepatitis B as demonstrated in studies in
woodchucks and ex vivo studies in humans.(4,67-69)
The main concerns of this approach are induction of
uncontrolled hepatitis flares and autoimmunity, which
can lead to fatal organ damage.(70)
THERAPEUTIC VACCINE
The goal of therapeutic vaccination is to stimulate or
boost the host immune response to restore immune
control, resulting in sustained suppression of HBV
replication and ultimately HBsAg loss. Therapeutic
vaccination strategies including conventional HBsAg
vaccine with or without potent adjuvants, T-cell vac-
cine, immune complexes of HBsAg and human anti-
HBs, apoptotic cells that express HBV antigens, DNA
vaccines, and viral vectors expressing HBV proteins
have been evaluated with limited success. Patients with
high viral loads may be less responsive, and patients
with cirrhosis may be at higher risk for immune-
mediated hepatitis flares. Pretreatment with NAs to
suppress HBV replication may enhance HBV-specific
T-cell response and prevent flares. GS-4774, a heat-
inactivated yeast-based vaccine expressing HBV S/C/
X
fusion
protein,
induced
HBV-specific
T-cell
responses in healthy volunteers; but HBsAg decline
and HBsAg loss were not observed in chronic hepatitis
B patients virally suppressed on NAs as well as those
who were NA-naive.(71-73) A list of therapeutic vac-
cines tested in clinical trials is provided in Supporting
Table S1.
Combination of Antiviral
and Immune Modulatory
Therapies
Combinations of antiviral therapy targeting multiple
steps in the HBV life cycle to suppress viral replication
and viral antigen production and immune modulatory
therapy to restore immune response to HBV will likely
be needed to achieve the goal of HBV “cure,” but
which specific combination of agents will be needed is
not certain because most antiviral or immune modula-
tory drugs in clinical evaluation are entering either
phase 1b or phase 2 trials at this time. The possibility
that HBV-specific T-cell function can be partially
restored has been demonstrated in patients with
chronic HBV who had spontaneous or antivirus (IFN
or NA)–mediated HBeAg or HBsAg loss.(74,75) With
the availability of novel approaches such as siRNA or
combination of antiviral agents targeting different
steps in the HBV life cycle, marked reduction and
even shutdown of HBsAg production may be achieved
in a higher proportion of patients. The reduction in
antigen load might facilitate the restoration of HBV-
specific T-cell responses. Historically, immune modu-
latory therapies have focused on patients in the
immune-active phase, but recent studies suggest that
patients in the “immune-tolerant or high-replication
noninflammatory” phase should also be considered as
HBV-specific T cells are present in this phase of dis-
ease.(3,76) The ability to “cure” hepatitis B at earlier
stages of liver disease would theoretically have a greater
impact on reducing risk of HCC.
Clinical Trials Aimed
at HBV Cure
EFFICACY ENDPOINTS FOR
CLINICAL TRIALS
Initial trials of IFN and NA used biochemical, viro-
logical, serological, and histological endpoints to assess
efficacy, while more recent trials have focused on viro-
logical and serological endpoints because these end-
points have been shown to correlate with improved
clinical outcomes.(36,77-79) The use of a biochemical
endpoint is problematic because of the lack of a stan-
dardized definition of normal ALT. Furthermore, with
increasing prevalence of obesity and nonalcoholic fatty
liver disease, failure to normalize ALT may not neces-
sarily indicate ongoing liver inflammation induced by
HBV. Indeed, phase 3 clinical trials of NAs have con-
sistently found a lower percent of patients achieving a
biochemical versus a virological response. Noninvasive
assessments of liver fibrosis have replaced liver biopsies
in assessing liver disease in clinical practice, and a his-
tological endpoint would no longer be practical or nec-
essary for assessing functional cure. However, liver
biopsies may be required in proof-of-concept studies to
confirm a novel mode of action and/or to validate non-
invasive surrogate markers of antiviral activity.
For both antiviral and immune modulatory therapy
trials, survey respondents ranked suppression of serum
HBV DNA to undetectable and loss of HBsAg as the
most important primary efficacy endpoint for phase 2
HEPATOLOGY, Vol. 66, No. 4, 2017
LOK ET AL.
1305
 and phase 3 trials, respectively; and the expert panel
agreed. The difference in ranking of primary efficacy
endpoint for phase 2 versus phase 3 trials reflects a
desire to have an earlier readout in phase 2 trials and the
potential difficulty in achieving HBsAg loss after shorter
treatment. HBV DNA suppression will not be an
appropriate endpoint for trials enrolling patients who
are virally suppressed on NAs. Decline in serum HBsAg
level has been used as an endpoint in some trials, but
there is no consensus on whether the kinetics of decline
in HBsAg level can predict ultimate HBsAg loss.
There was general consensus (�65%) that the most
appropriate time to assess the primary efficacy end-
point for phase 3 trials of novel antiviral or immune
modulatory therapies should be month 6 posttreat-
ment. The choice reflected the intent to achieve a
durable response (“cure”) after a finite course of treat-
ment. There was less consensus on the optimal time
for assessing efficacy in phase 2 trials, with the
responses divided between month 6 on treatment ver-
sus month 6 posttreatment. The expert panel indicated
that the most appropriate time to assess efficacy end-
points may depend on the mechanism of action and
half-life of the drug. For example, drugs that inhibit
reverse transcription of HBV pgRNA to HBV DNA
are expected to result in rapid decline in serum HBV
DNA levels, while drugs aimed at restoring immune
response may take longer to have any measurable
effects on viral load. The expert panel also emphasized
the need for long-term follow-up to confirm durability
of responses and impact on clinical outcomes.
DIAGNOSTIC ASSAYS FOR NEW
MARKERS TO DETERMINE
THERAPEUTIC EFFICACY
There was consensus on the need for standardized
assays to provide mechanistic insights into the effects of
novel antiviral or immune modulatory agents and to have
new surrogate markers to assess HBV “cure” (Table 1).
Serum HBsAg Assays
HBsAg loss was ranked as the most important effi-
cacy endpoint for phase 3 trials of both novel antiviral
and immune modulatory therapies. Some experts sug-
gested the need for more sensitive HBsAg assays.
Others indicated that the persistence of low levels of
HBsAg in serum may stem not from persistent
cccDNA transcription but from integrated HBV
DNA genomes. Assays that can differentiate HBsAg
originating from integrated HBV DNA versus ccc
DNA are required. Failure to detect HBsAg in serum
may not represent shutdown of HBsAg production as
circulating HBsAg may be complexed to anti-HBs.
HBV produces a surplus of empty envelope particles,
which can outnumber virions by >1,000-fold. Assays
that can differentiate surface proteins in virions versus
subviral particles (large, middle versus small HBsAg
proteins) would be informative.
Serum HBsAg decline may be used as a surrogate to
explore efficacy in early-phase trials, although its accu-
racy in predicting HBsAg loss has not been estab-
lished. Quantitative HBsAg assays can also be used to
categorize disease stage and to prognosticate. Several
standardized quantitative HBsAg assays have been
available in Europe and in Asia in the last decade, and
the consensus is that they will be essential tools for
new drug development.
cccDNA Quantification
and Transcriptional Activity
Many new antiviral agents in development aim to
enhance elimination or degradation of cccDNA or to
epigenetically modify cccDNA transcription. Assays
that reliably measure concentrations of cccDNA and/
or its transcriptional activity would directly assess effi-
cacy of these agents and would be invaluable in proof-
of-concept studies. Currently, there are no standard-
ized assays for intrahepatic cccDNA. However, there
was consensus that an adequate sample of liver tissue
would be necessary and that appropriate measures to
ensure specificity are needed, particularly in the pres-
ence of abundant relaxed circular DNA.
Assays for serum markers that are reliable surrogates
of intrahepatic cccDNA would be desirable for clinical
trials. Several studies have shown that serum HBsAg
level correlates better with hepatic cccDNA than serum
HBV DNA level, suggesting that it is an indirect
marker of cccDNA.(80,81) However, while the correla-
tion is satisfactory in HBeAg-positive patients, it is sub-
optimal in HBeAg-negative patients.(80,82) HBsAg can
be translated from subviral RNAs transcribed from
cccDNA or from integrated HBV DNA. It has been
suggested that HBsAg is predominantly derived from
cccDNA in HBeAg-positive patients, while an increas-
ing proportion is derived from integrated HBV DNA
in HBeAg-negative persons. Recent studies suggest that
serum HBV RNA and hepatitis B core-related antigen
(HBcrAg) levels may be more reliable surrogates of
hepatic cccDNA than HBsAg levels.

TABLE 1. Potential Diagnostic Tools/Surrogate Markers for HBV Cure
HBV Marker
Purpose
Rationale/Comments
HBsAg, ultrasensitive qualitative or quantita-
tive assay
To detect minimal residual HBsAg, lower
limit of detection of Lumipulse assay
0.004 IU/mL compared to current assays
0.05 IU/mL
HBsAg loss is considered the most reliable
indicator for functional cure.
HBsAg fragments, epitope mapping
To determine whether residual HBsAg is
translated from cccDNA transcripts or
integrated HBV DNA transcripts
To detect antivirus-resistant/immune escape
HBsAg variants
Persistent detection of HBsAg may be from
integrated HBV DNA and not cccDNA.
Integrated HBV DNA is often fragmented
with deletions and rearrangements, while
cccDNA translates into full-length HBsAg.
HBsAg variants may give rise to
false-negative results or inaccuracy in
quantification in current assays.
Large (L) versus middle (M) versus small
(S) surface protein
To differentiate complete virions from empty
envelope particles
Complete virions are coated with L, M, & S
surface proteins; but empty envelope
particles comprise mostly S surface
proteins.
HBsAg–anti-HBs immune complex
To detect residual HBsAg masked by
anti-HBs in immune complex
HBsAg loss is considered the most reliable
indicator for functional cure.
Quantitative HBsAg level
To facilitate differentiation of inactive carriers
from HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis
To predict outcome in HBeAg-negative
patients with low serum HBV DNA
Serves as an intermediary measure of HBsAg
loss. HBsAg level declines before it
becomes undetectable. but accuracy in
predicting HBsAg loss is low.
HBV RNA level
To predict viral relapse when treatment is
stopped
Serves as a surrogate for transcriptionally
active cccDNA, particularly if assay is
specific for pgRNA. Encapsidated pgRNA
can be enveloped and secreted, levels
higher in patients on NA because reverse
transcription of pgRNA to HBV DNA is
blocked. Shown in some studies to predict
viral relapse after discontinuation of NA.
Specificity of current assays for pgRNA
versus subgenomic RNAs is unknown.
HBcrAg
To correlate levels with intrahepatic HBV
DNA
To predict viral relapse when treatment is
stopped
Translated from HBV precore/core gene, can
assemble into defective particles that are
secreted. Shown in some studies to correlate
with intrahepatic HBV DNA and cccDNA
transcriptional activity and to predict viral
relapse after discontinuation of NA.
Limitation: lack of sensitivity, composite
biomarker
cccDNA quantification and transcriptional
activity
To quantify cccDNA from treated and
untreated patients
To assess transcriptional activity: pgRNA/
cccDNA ratio
cccDNA serves as a template for
transcription of HBV RNA and translation
of HBV antigens. Most direct measure of
HBV cure. Adequate sample of liver tissue
and stringent protocol to ensure specificity
are required.
Immune response to HBV antigens
To assess role as a biomarker for treatment
response
Restoration of immune response is
considered a necessary prerequisite for
HBV cure. Unclear what types of immune
response are critical, what methods to
use, and criteria for improvement or
restoration of response that will translate
to cure.

1307
 therapy, probably because inhibition of reverse tran-
scription of pgRNA by NA leads to accumulation of
encapsidated pgRNA, some of which may be envel-
oped and secreted. Thus, the detection of HBV RNA
in serum in the absence of detectable serum HBV
DNA in patients receiving NA therapy could infer
ongoing cccDNA transcription and has been shown to
be a predictor of viral relapse after discontinuation of
NA therapy.(84) Assays for serum HBV RNA levels,
particularly if they are specific for pgRNA, may pro-
vide a useful surrogate for transcriptionally active
cccDNA.
Serum HBcrAg Assays
The HBV precore/core gene is translated into the
core protein, precore/core precursor, and HBeAg;
these proteins can be collectively measured. HBcrAg
can assemble into defective, enveloped particles that
that do not contain HBV RNA or HBV DNA. A
core-related antigen immunoassay measuring all these
forms of precore/core gene expression has been devel-
oped. Serum HBcrAg levels have been shown to corre-
late with hepatic HBV DNA and to predict viral
relapse after discontinuation of NA therapy.(85) Assays
for serum HBcrAg levels may provide indirect evi-
dence for transcriptionally active cccDNA.(86)
Immune Response to HBV
Restoration of immune response to HBV is a key
step toward HBV “cure.” Most immune modulatory
therapies have focused on restoring T-cell response.
While markers of response to antiviral therapies can be
used to evaluate immune modulatory therapies, stan-
dardized assays to measure improvement in specific
immune responses to predict viral clearance would be
informative in early-phase drug development. The
development of standardized assays to assess res-
toration of immune responses to HBV will require
consensus on the requisite assays; their methodology,
sensitivity, and specificity; their correct interpretation
and reproducibility in different laboratories; and cross-
validation of the assays.
Approval of HBV Diagnostic
Assays
Development of standardized assays for surrogate
endpoints for HBV cure should occur in parallel
with development of novel antiviral and immune
modulatory therapies to expedite research. During
the closed session, the US Food and Drug Adminis-
tration and European Medicines Agency representa-
tives proposed consideration of simultaneous testing
of multiple intermediate secondary endpoints in all
phase 2 and 3 trials. The research assays must be
standardized and data and assay platforms shared to
facilitate identification of the appropriate surrogate
markers of efficacy. It is important that the approval
of new treatments is linked to the development and
approval of new diagnostic assays used to measure
efficacy or to predict response.
ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY
AND STOP RULES
The remarkable safety profile of current NAs
imposes a stringent requirement for the safety of new
HBV therapies at all stages of the disease. A unique
concern in the development of hepatitis B therapies is
the risk of severe hepatitis flares, which can result in
hepatic decompensation and death. The US Food and
Drug Administration has explicit recommendations on
managing drug-induced liver injury; however, these
recommendations do not apply to patients with under-
lying liver disease. Furthermore, transient hepatitis
flares are not always harmful and may portend immune
clearance of infected hepatocytes. Hepatitis flares may
be due to direct drug-induced liver injury, drug-
induced immune-mediated hepatitis (e.g., checkpoint
inhibitors), the underlying disease (incomplete viral
suppression), or immune clearance of infected hepato-
cytes (successful viral suppression and accompanying
restitution of the host immune response). The timing
and course of the flare, as well as the associated chro-
nological changes in serum HBV DNA levels, can
help in differentiating the cause of most, but not all,
hepatitis flares; for example, flares related to drug-
induced liver injury may be idiosyncratic and occur at
any time. There was no consensus on definition of
hepatitis flares (magnitude of ALT increase, absolute
value, or fold-change compared to baseline); however,
a majority of survey respondents and the expert panel
agreed that flares accompanied by increase in bilirubin
or prothrombin time and flares in patients with cirrho-
sis should be considered severe. Other adverse events
can also occur, e.g., off-target effects of siRNA or epi-
genetic modification, autoimmunity associated with
checkpoint inhibitors, and hepatotoxicity from reten-
tion of dysfunctional viral particles. There was no con-
sensus on when a trial or development of a new agent
should be stopped due to safety concerns; however,
LOK ET AL.
HEPATOLOGY, October 2017
1308
 survey respondents and the expert panel indicated
that any death or liver transplantation, hepatic decom-
pensation, irreversible autoimmunity, or incidence of
severe hepatitis flare in >5% of patients could prompt
a halt. Two-thirds of respondents to the survey and
most of the expert panel recommended that safety and
efficacy should be assessed for at least 6 months after
stopping therapy.
DESIGN OF CLINICAL TRIALS
FOR HBV CURE
A combination of antiviral and immune modulatory
therapies will most likely be needed to increase the
likelihood of HBV cures. There was consensus that
the antiviral activity and safety of individual new agents
used as monotherapy and infrequent or insignificant
drug interactions should be first established before pro-
gressing to clinical trials of combination therapy. How-
ever, demonstration of efficacy as a monotherapy need
not be required.
New therapies are most needed for patients at high
risk of HBV-associated mortality (cirrhosis) and those
in whom current therapies are less effective (immune-
tolerant, hepatitis D virus infection). However, in
designing early-phase clinical trials, the target patient
populations will necessarily be those who are most
likely to respond and able to tolerate possible exa-
cerbations of hepatitis. The consensus was to initially
conduct trials in treatment-na€
ıve, HBeAg-positive
patients with active disease or in HBeAg-positive or
HBeAg-negative patients virally suppressed on NAs.
Proof-of-principle and safety data would first be estab-
lished in patients without cirrhosis.
A particular challenge with designing phase 2 stud-
ies is to identify a target population with sufficient het-
erogeneity to be representative of the population with
chronic hepatitis B but not so diverse that it hinders
analysis because of multiple subgroups. Among the
survey respondents, 59% felt that patient subpopula-
tions should be studied separately. If multiple patient
populations were included in the same trial, patients
could be potentially stratified for cirrhosis, HBeAg sta-
tus, HBsAg level, HBV DNA level, treatment history,
and HBV genotype. Standardized criteria for ascer-
taining cirrhosis by noninvasive serum markers and/or
liver elastography are required.
Given the heterogeneity of the natural course of
chronic hepatitis B, there was consensus that random-
ized controlled trials are needed to establish efficacy
and that comparison with placebo is feasible and
ethical in trials for patients in the immune-tolerant or
inactive phases because current guidelines do not rec-
ommend treatment for these patients. For patients
with active disease or cirrhosis, investigational new
agents can be compared to NA or IFN. Alternatively,
the new drug can be tested against placebo as an addi-
tional therapy to NA. There was consensus that the
trials should aim to demonstrate superiority of the
investigational therapy.

 Summary and
Recommendations
A summary of the recommendations on endpoints
and design of clinical trials for HBV cure is presented in
Table 2. Improved understanding of the HBV life cycle
and host immune response to HBV has facilitated dis-
covery and design of antiviral therapies directed against
multiple steps of the HBV replication cycle, as well as
potential
immunomodulatory
therapies
to
restore
immune response to HBV infection. Development of
novel HBV therapies will be further aided by the avail-
ability of improved cellular and animal infection models.
While this progress has raised the possibility of a cure
for hepatitis B, a complete sterilizing cure, i.e., viral
eradication from the host, may be unrealistic due to the
presence of integrated HBV DNA. Although HBsAg
clearance is infrequent, it does occur with NA and IFN
therapy and is associated with improved clinical out-
comes. Therefore, a functional cure (characterized by
sustained loss of HBsAg with or without anti-HBs
seroconversion) after a finite course of novel antiviral
and immune modulatory therapies in a higher propor-
tion of patients than is currently achieved with existing
treatments is an attainable goal.
Cooperation between academia, industry, and regu-
latory agencies to standardize and validate surrogate
markers for cure, in order to facilitate the development
of curative therapies and to facilitate the path from dis-
covery to regulatory approval, is required. Limited
proof-of-concept monotherapy studies to evaluate
safety and antiviral activity should be conducted prior
to proceeding to combination therapy. The safety of
any new curative therapies will be paramount given the
excellent safety of currently approved NAs. Continued
collaboration among the stakeholders will make HBV
“cure” a reality for patients with chronic HBV.
