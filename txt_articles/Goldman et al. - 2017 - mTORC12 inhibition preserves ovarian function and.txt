The ovary contains oocytes within immature (primordial) follicles
that are fixed in number at birth. Activation of follicles within this
fixed pool causes an irreversible decline in reproductive capacity,
known as the ovarian reserve, until menopause. Premenopausal
women undergoing commonly used genotoxic (DNA-damaging)
chemotherapy experience an accelerated loss of the ovarian
reserve, leading to subfertility and infertility. Therefore, there is
considerable interest but little effective progress in preserving
ovarian function during chemotherapy. Here we show that block-
ing the kinase mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin
(mTOR) with clinically available small-molecule inhibitors pre-
serves ovarian function and fertility during chemotherapy. Using
a clinically relevant mouse model of chemotherapy-induced gona-
dotoxicity by cyclophosphamide, and inhibition of mTOR complex
1 (mTORC1) with the clinically approved drug everolimus (RAD001)
or inhibition of mTORC1/2 with the experimental drug INK128,
we show that mTOR inhibition preserves the ovarian reserve,
primordial follicle counts, serum anti-Mullerian hormone levels (a
rigorous measure of the ovarian reserve), and fertility. Chemo-
therapy-treated animals had significantly fewer offspring com-
pared with all other treatment groups, whereas cotreatment
with mTOR inhibitors preserved normal fertility. Inhibition of
mTORC1 or mTORC1/2 within ovaries was achieved during
chemotherapy cotreatment, concomitant with preservation of
primordial follicle counts. Importantly, our findings indicate that
as little as a two- to fourfold reduction in mTOR activity
preserves ovarian function and normal birth numbers. As ever-
olimus is approved for tamoxifen-resistant or relapsing estrogen
receptor-positive breast cancer, these findings represent a poten-
tially effective and readily accessible pharmacologic approach to
fertility preservation during conventional chemotherapy.
mTOR | fertility | chemotherapy | ovary | ovarian function
T
he ovaries have a fixed pool of primordial follicles at birth
constituting the ovarian reserve, activation or loss of which is
responsible for the irreversible decline in reproductive function
culminating in menopause (1). In women undergoing conven-
tional genotoxic chemotherapy as treatment for cancer, the pri-
mordial follicle pool is depleted at a rapid pace, resulting in
subfertility, infertility, and primary ovarian insufficiency (2).
Consequently, for female cancer survivors, the probability of a
first child after conventional gonadotoxic chemotherapy is sig-
nificantly diminished (3). Primary ovarian insufficiency also re-
sults in increased morbidity from bone loss, cognitive dysfunction,
sexual dysfunction, and cardiovascular disease (2). Apoptosis and
vascular effects of chemotherapy are well-described pathways of
chemotherapy-mediated ovarian damage, with growing follicles
and ovarian stroma particularly susceptible (4, 5). Widely used
alkylating chemotherapy agents such as cyclophosphamide (CY),
a mainstay of breast cancer chemotherapy, are highly gonadotoxic
and induce ovarian damage in part by activation of the PI3K/
phosphatase and tensin homolog/protein kinase B (PTEN/AKT)
pathway, leading to primordial follicle activation and follicular
“burnout” (6, 7).
Ovarian folliculogenesis initiates from the primordial follicle
stage, where an oocyte arrested in prophase of meiosis I and
surrounded by a single layer of squamous granulosa cells is ac-
tivated to grow and transition to a primary follicle, secondary
follicle, and then ultimately a preovulatory antral follicle (Fig.
S1). Most oocytes within the ovary exist in a quiescent state
within primordial follicles, relatively resistant to antimitotic and
genotoxic agents (8, 9). Follicular burnout refers to the repeated
ovarian exposure to chemotherapy and damage to growing fol-
licles, mobilizing dormant primordial follicles to activate and
grow to replace damaged antral follicles (6, 8). Premature fol-
licular activation exposes the entire follicular pool to chemo-
therapy’s genotoxic effects. Interventions designed to promote
ovarian quiescence would therefore be expected to reduce the
ovarian toxicity of cancer regimens. This is supported by pre-
treatment suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian
axis with gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs that
maintain the ovary in a quiescent state, although this approach is
controversial presumably because only a fraction of the follicular
pool is sensitive to gonadotropins (10, 11). In contrast, we rea-
soned that pharmacologic suppression of the earliest stages of
follicular development should protect the entire follicle pool,
thereby greatly expanding pharmacologic fertility preservation.
This strategy could complement oocyte and embryo cryopreser-
vation, which provides only a limited supply of gametes or em-
bryos without the benefit of long-term ovarian protection,
and which can currently only be used in peri- or postpubertal
females (12).
Significance
A major unresolved issue for premenopausal women un-
dergoing chemotherapy is infertility due to the loss of non-
renewable ovarian primordial follicles. We show that
pharmacologic down-regulation of the mammalian/mechanis-
tic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway during chemotherapy
in a mouse model prevents activation of primordial follicles,
preserves ovarian function, and maintains normal fertility us-
ing clinically available inhibitors of mTOR complex (C)1 and
mTORC1/2. These findings represent a feasible pharmacologic
approach for preservation of ovarian function and fertility
during treatment with conventional chemotherapy.

 Activation of the mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin
(mTOR) pathway is critical to primordial follicle activation (13–
15). mTOR is a serine/threonine kinase and a metabolic sensor
that regulates mRNA translation, cell growth, proliferation,
autophagy, nutrient signaling, and survival (16). Accelerated
mTOR activity in the oocyte by deletion of PTEN- or TSC1-
negative regulators simultaneously activates the entire pool of
primordial follicles in mice, resulting in primary ovarian in-
sufficiency (13, 14, 17). Thus, mTOR stimulators increase the
activation of primordial follicles in animal models and mTOR
inhibitors block the primordial-to-primary follicle transition (18),
highlighting the critical importance of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway (19).
Results
CY Chemotherapy Reduces Primordial Follicle Counts in a Dose-
Dependent
Manner
and
Activates
the
Transition
to
Growing
Follicles. To establish the effects of chemotherapy regimens on
primordial follicles, we conducted a dose-finding pilot study of
CY exposure. Mice received weekly i.p. injections of vehicle
(normal saline), 75 mg/kg CY, or 150 mg/kg CY over 3 wk fol-
lowed by sacrifice 1 wk following the final dose. No gross ab-
normalities in the animals were identified at necropsy and by
pathohistologic examination. No significant differences in weight
at sacrifice were found between treatment groups (Fig. S2A).
Because growing follicles may be overrepresented when serial
ovarian sections are analyzed and estimations of follicle counts
have been shown to be equivalent when whole ovaries are serially
sectioned compared with interval sectioning (20), ovaries were
sectioned in five 100-μm intervals (interval sectioning). The mean
number of primordial follicles per ovarian surface area (mm2), a
standard measure of gonadotoxicity, was inversely related to
treatment dose, with the untreated control group having the
highest average number of primordial follicles per mm2 (3.5 ± 0.5)
compared with a conventional dose of 75 mg/kg CY (1.4 ± 0.2)
and a sterilizing dose of 150 mg/kg CY (0.2 ± 0.1) (Fig. S2B).
To determine the acute impact of CY exposure on acute
ovarian follicle dynamics, we treated mice with one high dose of
CY (150 mg/kg) followed by characterization at 24 h post-
exposure. There were no differences in untreated and treated
mean weight, mean ovarian weight, or ovarian surface area.
However, CY-treated mice had significantly fewer (60% re-
duction) primordial follicles than control mice (Fig. 1A). CY
treatment also induced rapid follicle activation, demonstrating
2.5 times more growing follicles per mm2 than untreated controls
(Fig. 1 B and C).
mTOR Inhibitors Down-Regulate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR Pathway in
Ovaries and Preserve Primordial Follicles When Administered CY.
Mice were treated with CY, with or without mTOR inhibitors,
as shown in the schema for treatment, and tissues were harvested
(Fig. S3). CY treatment moderately increased AKT/mTOR
pathway activation, shown by phosphorylation of S473 AKT and
S65 4E-BP1 to P-AKT and P-4E-BP1, respectively, compared
with untreated controls, measured within 2 h of the last daily
mTOR inhibitor treatment (Fig. 2A). Inhibition of mTOR
complex 1 (mTORC1) with everolimus (RAD001) or mTORC1/2
with INK reduced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and S6 kinase
(S6K), with and without CY. Inhibition of AKT phosphorylation
was greater in ovaries exposed to INK than RAD. mTORC1/2
inhibition by INK was also more effective in blocking phos-
phorylation of all downstream targets, consistent with the weaker
activity of allosteric RAD (21). Phosphorylation of AKT and
S6K was effectively blocked in ovaries exposed to CY with RAD
or INK, more so than with mTOR inhibitors alone, suggesting
possible synergism (Fig. S4).
Following immunoblotting of whole-ovary lysates, immuno-
histochemistry (IHC) was used to assess the activity of mTORC1
and mTORC1/2 within primordial follicles using 4E-BP1 and
S6K phosphorylation within 2 h of the last inhibitor dose. Following
treatment with CY and mTORC1/2 (INK) inhibition, primordial
follicles averaged fourfold reduced mTOR activity compared
with approximately twofold reduction for mTORC1-only inhibition
(RAD) (Fig. 2 B–E). Overall, INK was a more effective
mTORC1 inhibitor than RAD, even in non–CY-treated con-
trols. RAD efficacy was tested by examining S6K phosphoryla-
tion and, in contrast to 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, inhibition of
mTORC1-only (RAD) reduced S6K phosphorylation by twofold
in follicles of CY-treated animals compared with fourfold for
mTORC1/2 inhibition (Fig. 2 D and E).
Using conditions established above, mTOR inhibitors were
treated with and without CY to assess the effects of cotreatment
on follicle counts (schema, Fig. S3). Female mice were
randomized into six groups (n = 5 per group) and treated with
75 mg/kg CY in three weekly doses with or without RAD or INK
administered by daily oral gavage, followed by sacrifice 1 wk
after the final dose of chemotherapy. Markers of toxicity were
compared, including mouse weights (g) pre- and posttreatment,
ovarian surface area (mm2), and ovarian weight (μg) (Fig. S5).
There were no differences between groups when comparing
ovarian surface area at sacrifice or ovarian weight at sacrifice
(Fig. S5 A and B). Mouse weight was similar at baseline between
all groups with the exception of the RAD+CY group, which had
an average weight of 7.9% less than control at baseline (16.4 ±
0.1 vs. 17.7 ± 0.5, P = 0.03) (Fig. S5C). All mice treated with
mTOR inhibitors weighed significantly more at sacrifice than
they did at baseline, a phenomenon not seen in mice treated with
CY or in untreated controls (Fig. S5C). Mice treated with 75 mg/kg
CY alone had a 64% reduction in primordial follicles per mm2

 compared with untreated controls (Fig. 3 A and B). Mice treated
with 75 mg/kg CY together with RAD had twice as many primordial
follicles compared with CY alone, and almost three times as many
with INK. In animals treated with RAD or INK alone, there was a
trend toward greater primordial follicle counts compared with un-
treated controls, which did not reach statistical significance. There
were fewer primary follicles per mm2 with mTORC1 or mTORC1/2
inhibition when cotreated with CY, compared with mTORC1 or
mTORC1/2 inhibition alone, supporting a synergistic effect of
cotreatment on prevention of follicle activation (Fig. 3C). Second-
ary follicle counts and antral follicle counts were not statistically
different among all treatment groups, despite a trend toward fewer
antral follicles in the 75 mg/kg CY group (Fig. 3 D and E). Of note,
total follicle counts were lower in all CY-treated mice compared
with control, RAD alone, and INK alone, suggesting that mTOR
inhibitors incompletely prevented primordial follicle activation and
loss. This is likely secondary to the timing of administration (2 d
before CY) and time needed to achieve steady-state concentrations,
which is ∼7 d (22, 23) (Fig. S6). Strikingly, ovaries of CY-treated
mice demonstrated a ratio of growing to primordial follicles more
than twice that of ovaries from mice cotreated with CY+RAD or
CY+INK (Fig. 3F), supporting our finding that mTOR inhibitors
maintain ovarian quiescence and preserve the primordial follicle
pool. The histological follicle counts also substantiate the molecular
data, indicating that more than twofold, but no more than fourfold,
down-regulation of mTORC1 and/or coinhibition of mTORC2 is all
that is required to maintain ovarian follicle quiescence.
mTOR Inhibition Prevents Chemotherapy-Mediated Reduction in
Serum Anti-Mullerian Hormone in a Dose-Dependent Manner. Anti-
Mullerian hormone (AMH) is produced by the granulosa cells of
preantral and small antral follicles, correlates with histological
primordial follicle numbers, and is one of the most important
measures of ovarian reserve used clinically (24, 25). To in-
vestigate the impact of CY treatment on serum AMH, 8-wk-old
mice were administered 75 mg/kg CY, 150 mg/kg CY, or vehicle
(control) weekly for 3 wk and killed 1 wk following the final
treatment. Untreated mice had significantly higher levels of se-
rum AMH compared with 75 mg/kg CY-treated animals, which
declined further at 150 mg/kg CY (Fig. 4A), indicative of che-
motherapy-driven loss of follicles. Using conditions established
above, mTOR inhibitors were treated with and without CY, and
effects of cotreatment on serum AMH were assessed. There was
no statistically significant difference in circulating AMH levels
between untreated controls and RAD- or INK-treated groups in
the absence of CY treatment (Fig. 4B). However, mice cotreated
for 3 wk with weekly 75 mg/kg CY and daily RAD, and killed at
11 wk of age, showed significantly higher AMH levels compared
with mice treated with CY alone (Fig. 4C). Importantly, even a
small decrease in AMH levels reflects a clinical reduction in
ovarian reserve (26). The same positive trend in AMH levels
existed with INK+CY treatment but did not reach statistical
significance.
mTOR Inhibitors Preserve Fertility in Chemotherapy-Treated Mice.
We next investigated whether mTOR inhibition also preserves
fertility during chemotherapy. Eight-week-old female mice were
treated with a nonsterilizing dose of 75 mg/kg CY in four weekly
doses, with or without RAD or INK cotreatment. One additional
week of treatment was used to further impact on subfertility,
providing even more stringent criteria for the assessment of
fertility than used earlier. To ensure two full cycles of primordial
follicle activation following treatment, breeding commenced
8 wk following the final treatment. Mice were harem-bred with
proven male breeders and given 8 wk to breed (Fig. S3). Studies
have shown that rodents are capable of normal mating behavior
as early as 14 d following CY exposure (27).
There was no difference in mouse weight following 4 wk of
treatment (P > 0.05) (Fig. S7). After an 8-wk delay, all mice had
incrementally gained weight and there were no differences in
mouse weights between groups, supporting no differences in
systemic toxicity between groups (P > 0.05) (Fig. S7). Two out of
five female CY-only treated mice were infertile, compared with
no infertile females in the RAD+CY and INK+CY groups. The
CY-treated animals also had significantly fewer pups per litter
compared with controls (3.4 ± 1.7 vs. 8.8 ± 0.5, P < 0.005) (Fig.

mTORC1 and mTORC1/2 inhibitors down-regulate downstream tar-
gets of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in the ovary. Whole ovaries from five
mice per group of 8-wk-old mice treated with CY with or without RAD or
INK, RAD or INK alone, or untreated control were lysed for immunoblot or
paraffin-embedded, sectioned, and stained for IHC. (A) CY slightly increased
phosphorylation of targets of the mTOR pathway P-AKT and P-4E-BP1
compared with control. Inhibition of mTORC1 with RAD and mTORC1/2 with
INK decreased phosphorylation of AKT, 4E-BP1, and S6K, with and without
CY. Quantification is shown in Fig. S4. (B) mTORC1/2 (INK) inhibition signif-
icantly decreased P-4E-BP1 expression compared with control (4.8% vs.
63.2%, ***P < 0.0001). Following CY treatment, primordial follicles were
reduced in P-4E-BP1 expression by fourfold by mTORC1/2 (INK) inhibition
compared with CY alone (18.2% vs. 71.4%, *P < 0.05). Mean ± SEM.

 5A). Importantly, RAD+CY (7.4 ± 1.2) and INK+CY (7.4 ±0.9)
treatment groups produced significantly more pups per litter
compared with CY alone (3.4 ± 1.7, P < 0.05). There were no
differences in litter size between RAD alone, INK alone, and
untreated controls. There were no differences in the percentage
of pups born live, pup weight, or pup anomalies among treatment
groups (Fig. 5 B and C). The time from the start of breeding (days)
to birth was similar between groups, arguing against altered en-
docrine effects (Fig. 5D). There was a trend toward increased time
from male introduction to birth in the CY group compared with
untreated controls, which did not reach significance.
Discussion
Inhibitors of mTORC1 and mTORC1/2 have a growing role in
cancer treatment as part of multiagent chemotherapeutic regi-
mens and are being explored for the treatment of a growing list
of malignant as well as nonmalignant conditions. Here we further
elucidated the critical role of the mTOR pathway in primordial
follicle activation and demonstrated that mTOR inhibitors can
have a second significant function in promoting follicular quies-
cence when administered as pretreatment and cotreatment with
conventional gonadotoxic chemotherapy. We show that daily ad-
ministration of mTOR inhibitors that achieve only a two- to
fourfold attenuation of mTOR activity can maintain ovarian fol-
licles in their primordial state during chemotherapy treatment,
maintain normal serum AMH levels, and preserve normal fertility.
Although estrus cyclicity was not assessed, our data do not support
an interpretation involving an effect of treatments on estrus cy-
clicity. The impact of CY on fertility was therefore related to
ovarian reserve rather than ovulation. In the mouse, the cycle of
follicle maturation requires ∼10 to 12 d from primordial follicle to
secondary follicle, and an additional 6 to 12 d for development to
the antral follicle (28) (see Fig. S8 for follicle classifications). We
obtained tissue and serum 1 wk after the third and final treatment
dose, so the difference observed in AMH level likely reflects the
impact of the first 1 to 2 wk of treatment on the primordial follicle
pool. Primordial follicle counts were significantly greater in the
RAD+CY group and INK+CY group compared with CY alone,
and AMH levels were significantly greater in RAD+CY compared
with CY. The actual AMH values were identical between RAD+
CY and INK+CY groups, but AMH did not reach significance
between the INK+CY and CY groups. This may be attributed to
variance but invites further investigation. Whereas primordial
follicle counts were significantly greater in mice cotreated with
mTOR inhibitors and CY compared with CY alone, total follicle
counts were lower among all CY-treated mice compared with
mice not exposed to CY. Follicular burnout is likely one of many
processes occurring in the ovary during chemotherapy exposure,
and growing follicles, vasculature, and ovarian stroma are also
susceptible to chemotherapy effects. Importantly, although oral
RAD001 is rapidly absorbed, steady-state concentrations are not
reached for ∼7 d (22). In our study, mTOR inhibitors were ad-
ministered for 2 d before the first exposure to chemotherapy, likely
insufficient to prevent early recruitment and subsequent loss of
primordial follicles during the first CY administration. Future
studies will be needed to determine the optimal timing of mTOR
inhibitor administration before chemotherapy.
Our data suggest that mTOR inhibitors may represent a fer-
tility-sparing pharmacologic therapy that can be administered
alongside gonadotoxic chemotherapy. Oocyte or embryo cryo-
preservation are proven methods of fertility preservation for
peri- and postmenarchal females but are time-consuming, costly,
may be medically contraindicated, and preserve only a limited
number of gametes or embryos with no maintenance of ovarian
function. Ovarian tissue cryopreservation is still an experimental
technique and requires an initial surgery to remove ovarian tis-
sue followed by subsequent surgery for autotransplantation, and
may risk reintroducing malignant cells (29).

Cotreatment with mTORC1 and mTORC1/2 inhibitors protects the
primordial follicle pool in CY-exposed ovaries. (A and B) Eight-week-old
C57BL/6 mice were treated with 75 mg/kg CY i.p. in three weekly doses,
±RAD or INK daily, and killed 1 wk after the final dose of CY. CY-treated
mice were 64% reduced in primordial follicles compared with untreated
controls. Mice treated with 75 mg/kg CY and RAD had 43% more primordial
follicles compared with CY alone (*P < 0.05). Mice treated with CY and INK
were 54% increased in primordial follicles compared with CY alone (**P <
0.005). Representative images are shown. (C) Mice cotreated with RAD+CY
or INK+CY trended toward fewer primary follicles compared with CY alone
(n.s., not significant; P > 0.05). (D and E) Secondary follicle and antral follicle
counts were not statistically different among treatment groups despite
trending toward fewer antral follicles in the 75 mg/kg CY group (n.s., P >
0.05). (F) Ovaries of CY-treated mice had twice the ratio of growing to pri-
mordial follicles compared with all other treatment groups (***P < 0.0001).
Ovaries of mice cotreated with CY+RAD or CY+INK had ratios of growing to
primordial follicles matching untreated controls. Results are derived from

Serum AMH decreases after CY treatment whereas mTOR inhibitor
cotreatment maintains AMH concentration. (A) AMH serum concentrations
were measured in untreated 8-wk-old C57BL/6 mice, mice exposed to three
weekly doses of 75 mg/kg CY, and mice exposed to three weekly doses of
150 mg/kg CY. Mice treated with 75 mg/kg CY had significantly lower serum
AMH levels compared with control (**P < 0.005), as did mice treated with
150 mg/kg CY (*P < 0.05). (B and C) AMH serum concentrations were mea-

polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) alone daily, 75 mg/kg CY weekly for 3 wk, RAD
daily, RAD daily plus 75 mg/kg CY weekly, INK daily, or INK plus 75 mg/kg CY
weekly. There were no differences in AMH concentrations in mice treated
with RAD or INK alone compared with untreated controls. Mean ± SEM.

 Intriguingly, in endometriosis, which contributes to diminished
ovarian reserve and an accelerated decline in fertility (1), en-
hanced follicular recruitment and burnout are observed in the
ovarian cortex of ovaries with endometriomas (30). The insulin
growth factor system, which regulates signaling through pathways
including AKT/mTOR, is altered in endometriotic tissues, sug-
gesting a similar relationship between mTOR activation and
follicular burnout in endometriosis (31). Data implicate mTOR
up-regulation in the poor reproductive outcomes of over-
weight and obese patients, who are more likely to be infertile,
have higher miscarriage rates, and poorer obstetric outcomes
compared with normal-weight peers (32–34). Obese rats demon-
strate accelerated ovarian follicle development and follicle loss
and activation of the mTOR pathway (35), whereas SIRT1 acti-
vators, which suppress mTOR, improve the ovarian reserve (36).
Caloric restriction in rats also down-regulates mTOR activity and
preserves the ovarian reserve (37). mTOR inhibitors may be at-
tractive for prevention of iatrogenic and noniatrogenic depletion
of ovarian reserve (31).
Beyond the important scope of fertility, primary ovarian in-
sufficiency has devastating emotional, psychosocial, and physical
consequences, contributing to depression, cognitive dysfunction,
bone loss, sexual dysfunction, and even cardiovascular mortality,
prevention of which all require maintenance of normal ovarian
function (2, 38–40). Moreover, with the continuing rise in aver-
age age at first birth in the United States and the reciprocally
reduced fertility rate (41, 42), the possibility of extending re-
productive potential is attractive. Investigating the relationship
between mTOR and the ovarian reserve may provide opportu-
nities for therapeutic intervention. Because the PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathway plays a critical role in primordial follicle acti-
vation (13, 43), this relationship has been investigated as a means
to promote follicle growth in patients with POI. In murine
models, inhibitors of PTEN (a negative regulator of PI3K) and
TSC1 and TSC2 (negative regulators of mTOR) have been
shown to activate the mTOR pathway and primordial follicles
(13, 14, 17). Similarly, AKT stimulators (both PI3K activators
and PTEN inhibitors) have been used in both preclinical and
experimental clinical models to activate in vitro cultured ovarian
cortical strips, retransplant the activated cortical strips, and
stimulate follicle growth in vivo (44). In a prospective study of 37
women with primary ovarian insufficiency who underwent
in vitro activation of ovarian cortical tissue with an AKT stim-
ulator followed by in vitro fertilization, 24 oocytes were retrieved
from six patients, ultimately leading to two successful deliveries
(44, 45). Moreover, Rictor/mTORC2 was recently implicated as
a key regulator of folliculogenesis, with inactivation of this
pathway ubiquitously leading to premature ovarian failure (15).
Studies are needed to assess the long-term reproductive im-
pact of mTOR inhibitors, and specifically the impact on future
pregnancies and offspring. Although few large studies exist re-
garding the impact of mTOR inhibitors on long-term fertility and
pregnancy outcomes, case series and observational studies de-
scribe fertility outcomes in patients who have been treated with
rapalogs following solid-organ transplant. Following kid-
ney transplant, women treated with long-term sirolimus (13 mo
or longer) developed amenorrhea, which resolved with its dis-
continuation, and men who were azoospermic developed normal
semen parameters and fathered children following discontinuation
(46). Case reports describe temporary azoospermia in men treated
with sirolimus, which resolved after its discontinuation or switch to
a different agent, and a rodent study further demonstrated the
reversible impact of sirolimus on male fertility (47, 48).
Although our study is limited by the use of a murine model,
the mouse and human ovary maintain many functional similari-
ties in that the ovarian reserve in both is maintained in primor-
dial follicles that localize to the ovarian cortex, and follicular
development occurs through the same stages (49, 50). It is im-
portant to note that the mTOR inhibitor regimens used in
clinical oncology practice are based on maximum tolerated doses
and are associated with stomatitis, fatigue, gastrointestinal dis-
tress, headache, and rash (51). Dosages used in our study were
extrapolated from these regimens to mice, and may thus be
greater than necessary for fertility preservation. Future studies
will assess the effects of mTOR inhibitors and alkylating chemo-
therapy on tumor dynamics, and determine optimal and minimal
dose levels and regimens.
Materials and Methods
In Vivo Murine Model. Studies were approved by the New York University
School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and con-
ducted in accordance with their guidelines. Female C57BL/6 mice aged 8 wk
(Taconic Biosciences) were housed under pathogen-free conditions in
autoclaved individually ventilated cages (IVCs) that included autowatering
and HEPA-filtered air. Room temperature was maintained at 68 to 69 °F and
cages on IVC racks were maintained at 70 to 71 °F. The vivarium light cycle
was 12 h on and 12 h off, animals were fed irradiated chow (Purina Lab diet
5053), and water was produced on-site using the reverse-osmosis method
with a reserve maintained on-site and delivered to the cage rack via an
automatic watering system.
Murine Model Treatment Protocols. Dose-finding pilot studies were per-
formed to identify the optimal chemotherapy regimen in our murine model.
The doses used were CY (Sigma-Aldrich; 6055-19-2) 75 mg/kg, CY 150 mg/kg,
RAD001 (Selleckchem.com; S1120; an mTORC1 inhibitor) 2.5 mg/kg, and
INK128 (Selleckchem.com; S2811; an mTORC1/2 inhibitor) 0.3 mg/kg. The
same dosages of CY, RAD001, and INK128 were maintained for the
treatment combinations.
Statistical Analysis. One-way analysis of variance, Student’s t test, chi-square
test, and Fisher’s exact test were used where appropriate. Data are pre-
sented as mean ± SEM with significance set at P < 0.05. The ratio of growing
to primordial follicles was calculated by dividing the total number of
growing follicles (primary, secondary) in each treatment group by the total
number of primordial follicles in each treatment group.

Cotreatment with RAD or INK at the time of CY administration in-
creases murine litter size. The average of five mice per treatment is shown
with SEM. (A) Quantification of the number of pups born in first litters. Two
mice from the CY treatment group were infertile (0). CY treatment signifi-
cantly reduces litter size compared with untreated controls (**P < 0.005),
and CY+RAD and CY+INK had significantly greater litter sizes than CY alone
(*P < 0.05). (B) Quantification of the percentage of live births. Two mice
from the CY treatment group are not shown due to infertility (n.s., P > 0.05).
(C) Quantification of pup weight. Two mice from the CY treatment group
are not shown due to infertility (n.s., P > 0.05). (D) Time (days) from male
introduction to birth. CY-treated mice trended toward a longer time to
birth, but this did not reach significance (n.s., P > 0.05). Results are derived
from five mice per treatment group with SEM shown.
