Abstract—In 2011, the United Nations set key targets to reach by 2025 to reduce the risk of premature noncommunicable 
disease death by 25% by 2025. With cardiovascular disease being the largest contributor to global mortality, accounting for 
nearly half of the 36 million annual noncommunicable disease deaths, achieving the 2025 goal requires that cardiovascular 
disease and its risk factors be aggressively addressed. The Global Cardiovascular Disease Taskforce, comprising the World 
Heart Federation, American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology Foundation, European Heart Network, and 
European Society of Cardiology, with expanded representation from Asia, Africa, and Latin America, along with global 
cardiovascular disease experts, disseminates information and approaches to reach the United Nations 2025 targets. The writing 
committee, which reflects Global Cardiovascular Disease Taskforce membership, engaged the Institute for Health Metrics and 
Evaluation, University of Washington, to develop region-specific estimates of premature cardiovascular mortality in 2025 
based on various scenarios. Results show that >5 million premature CVD deaths among men and 2.8 million among women 
are projected worldwide by 2025, which can be reduced to 3.5 million and 2.2 million, respectively, if risk factor targets for 
blood pressure, tobacco use, diabetes mellitus, and obesity are achieved. However, global risk factor targets have various 
effects, depending on region. For most regions, United Nations targets for reducing systolic blood pressure and tobacco use 
have more substantial effects on future scenarios compared with maintaining current levels of body mass index and fasting 
plasma glucose. However, preventing increases in body mass index has the largest effect in some high-income countries. An 
approach achieving reductions in multiple risk factors has the largest impact for almost all regions. Achieving these goals can 
be accomplished only if countries set priorities, implement cost-effective population wide strategies, and collaborate in public-
private partnerships across multiple sectors. (Circulation. 2016;133:e674–e690. DOI: 10.1161/CIR.0000000000000395.)

 Sacco et al  Reducing Global and Regional Deaths From CVDs and Stroke  e675
T
he World Health Organization (WHO), empowered by 
unanimous proclamation at the United Nations high-level 
meeting on noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in September 
2011, set a number of key targets for all nations to reach by 
2025.1 The overarching goal is to reduce the risk of prema-
ture deaths (defined as the probability of dying between the 
ages of 30 and 70 years) from NCDs (cardiovascular dis-
ease [CVD], including stroke, diabetes mellitus [DM], can-
cer, and chronic respiratory disease) by 25% by the year 
2025 (referred to as 25 by 25). The Global Cardiovascular 
Disease Taskforce, comprising the World Heart Federation, 
American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology 
Foundation, European Heart Network, and European Society 
of Cardiology, with expanded representation from Asia, 
Africa, and Latin America, along with global CVD experts, 
disseminates information and approaches to reach the WHO 
2025 targets.2–4
To achieve the overarching 25 by 25 target, the WHO 
identified 8 targets in the prevention, control, and treatment 
of 6 key risk factors, as well as 2 health systems targets 
related to the use of essential medicines, technologies, and 
drug therapies, to prevent NCDs, particularly CVDs.5 Of the 
8 targets, 6 directly align with traditional CVD and stroke 
risk factors: 3 risk factors (tobacco use, sodium intake, phys-
ical inactivity), 2 biological risk factors (raised blood pres-
sure [BP], DM/obesity), and 1 management target directed at 
the treatment of individuals at high risk of CVD. With CVD 
as the largest single contributor to global mortality, account-
ing for nearly half of the 36 million annual NCD deaths, 
and with a global cost of nearly US $863 billion, achiev-
ing the global target to reduce premature NCD deaths by 
25% requires that CVD and its risk factors be aggressively 
addressed by WHO member states, policy makers, profes-
sional organizations, public health experts, healthcare pro-
viders, and key stakeholders.4
Although the prevalence of many of these risk factors has 
improved globally over the past 30 years, with the exception 
of DM and obesity, trends are not homogeneous (Table 1).11 
Between 1990 and 2013, the age-standardized CVD death 
rate decreased by >22% for both ischemic heart disease and 
stroke.12 With these trends taken into account, continued prog-
ress toward improving cardiovascular health and reducing 
CVD and stroke deaths is vital to reaching the overall pre-
mature NCD mortality goal by 2025, just 1 decade away. The 
aims of this document are to investigate the potential impact 
of reaching selected targets in the WHO Global Monitoring 
Framework on the reduction of premature CVD mortal-
ity by 2025 and to examine the policy implications of these 
predictions.
Data and Methods
The writing committee reflects the members of the Global 
Cardiovascular Disease Taskforce. The committee engaged 
researchers at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, 
University of Washington, Seattle, to develop region-specific 
estimates of premature cardiovascular mortality in 2025 based 
on various scenarios. The Institute for Health Metrics and 
Evaluation is the coordinating center for the Global Burden of 
Disease (GBD) Study, a multinational effort to produce con-
sistent estimates of death and disability by age, sex, and over 
time for all countries.12
The methods and results of this exercise have been 
reported in detail.13 Data were drawn from the GBD 2013 
study.12 All estimates were produced separately for each age/
sex/country/disease-specific strata and then collapsed to cre-
ate regional estimates. A list of GBD 2015 geographies detail-
ing the countries that make up regions and superregions is 
available elsewhere.14 
To create a scenario in which risk factors continue the trend 
observed since 1990 (“business as usual”), the analysis first 
estimated the proportion of CVD and stroke deaths in 1990 
and 2013 resulting from raised systolic BP, tobacco smoking, 
high body mass index (BMI), and high fasting plasma glucose 
using a population-attributable fraction. The effect of serum 
cholesterol was not included because it was not listed among 
the 8 primary WHO 25 by 25 targets.
The theoretical minimum risk exposure distribution used 
for the GDB 2010 study was applied except for systolic BP, 
for which a theoretical minimum limit of 115 mm Hg was 
adopted.15 With the use of the annualized rate of change 
between 1990 and 2013, it was assumed that the remain-
ing deaths unattributed to these risk factors would continue 
their observed trend. Beginning in 2014, deaths attributable 
to the selected risk factors were estimated from the same 
population-attributable fraction and risk factor exposures 
estimated for GBD 2013 for each age/sex/country/year pro-
jected to 2025 and the annualized rate of change between 
1990 and 2013. Future scenarios were developed to match

4 key risk factor targets for 2025: no further increase in 
fasting plasma glucose, no further increase in BMI, a 25% 
reduction in the prevalence of systolic BP >140 mm Hg via a 
shift in the entire population distribution of systolic BP, and 
a 30% reduction in tobacco smoking prevalence, including 
associated effects from secondhand smoke. For BP, model-
ing a population-wide shift in systolic BP assumes that there 
will be both prevention and treatment of hypertension, but 
no BP target is specified. The analysis also estimated a sce-
nario in which all 4 of these targets are achieved, adjusting 
for their joint effects on mortality. The impact of access to 
medications was not modeled because comprehensive esti-
mates do not yet exist.
Results
2025 Estimates of the Absolute Number of 
Premature Deaths From CVD
From the GBD data set, 3 736 540 deaths (95% uncer-
tainty interval, 3 483 303–4 009 003) from CVD occurred 
in 2013 among men and 2 128 134 (95% uncertainty inter-
val, 1 814 857–2 366 726) among women across the globe 
for individuals 30 to 70 years of age. Table 2 shows that, 
globally, more men die prematurely of CVD than women, 
although no significant difference can be observed in sub-
Saharan Africa. For 2025, given population growth and 
assuming that trends in the selected risk factors continue, 
we estimate that 5 009 492 premature deaths from CVD 
among men (95% uncertainty interval, 4 632 942–5 389 257) 
and 2 769 945 among women (95% uncertainty interval, 
2 321 954–3 044 866) will occur, a relative increase of 
34% and 30% from 2013, respectively. Only among high-
income countries, which include the United States, Canada, 
Australia, Western Europe, Japan, and South Korea, are 
there projected reductions in the absolute number of prema-
ture deaths of −19% among men and −16% among women 
in 2025. For the rest of world, the number of premature 
deaths from CVD is projected to increase from 22% in Latin 
America and the Caribbean to 48% in sub-Saharan Africa 
among women and from 16% in Central Europe, Eastern 
Europe, and Central Asia to 56% in South Asia among men, 
largely because of aging and growth of populations.
Compared with the business as usual estimates, the mod-
eling showed major reductions in the number of premature

deaths resulting from CVD among men and women across all 
regions if the 25 by 25 targets for raised BP, smoking, obesity, 
and DM were achieved by 2025. Overall, the model projected 
a relative decrease of 5% among men and only a 1% increase 
among women in the number of premature deaths resulting 
from CVD compared with the increases of 34% and 30% 
in the business as usual estimates. A significant difference 
between scenarios in number of premature deaths caused by 
CVD in 2025, with no overlap of 95% uncertainty intervals, 
was seen globally for men and within the region made up of 
Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Oceania. Although there are 
projected increases from 2013 to 2025 in the absolute number 
of premature deaths in some regions, the 2025 estimates for 
the number of deaths in all regions were much improved if the 
risk factor targets were achieved.
2025 Estimates of Probability of Premature 
Mortality From CVD
The figures illustrate the global and regional projections for 
achieving a reduction in the probability of premature mortal-
ity from CVDs, including stroke by 2025. Figure 1 shows 
the global probability of premature death in women 30 to 
70 years of age resulting from CVD using data from 1990 
to 2013 and projects these estimates from 2014 to 2025. 
Notably, recent declines in premature CVD mortality lev-
eled off if risk factors continued the current trend. There was 
a small estimated reduction in premature mortality if the 
increase in fasting plasma glucose was halted. A similar mag-
nitude of decline was estimated if the prevalence of smoking 
was reduced by 30%. Next, a more modest reduction in pre-
mature mortality would be realized by halting the increase 
in elevated BMI. The most robust effect from a single risk 
factor target being met resulted from the achievement of the 
BP goal of reducing the prevalence of elevated systolic BP 
by 25%. An important assumption of this model is that the 
entire population distribution of 25% was shifted leftward 
to achieve the target, which includes reduction of systolic 
BP both >140 and <140 mm Hg. Shifts of this magnitude 
reflect an assumption that hypertension is both prevented, 
via dietary and lifestyle modification, and treated medically, 
via antihypertensive therapies. However, 2 key observations 
of the modeling exercise are that the single dominant risk 
factor strategy varied by region and that the combined strat-
egy dominated in almost all regions. The combined scenario 
if all 4 risk factor targets were achieved by 2025 would result 
in achieving the 25 by 25 mortality goal for women in 2025 
or shortly thereafter.
For men, the projections for the global probability of pre-
mature death caused by CVD differed (Figure 2). First, the 
risk of premature death from CVD was greater for men than 
women, and the scenario in which current trends continue 
to 2025 was estimated to lead to an increased premature 
probability of death in 2025 compared with 2013. If either 
the increase in fasting plasma glucose or elevated BMI was 
halted, then the effects on the premature CVD mortality 
among men was less than that for women, and no reduction 
in the risk of premature CVD mortality by 2025 could be 
detected because uncertainty estimates for 2013 and 2025 
overlapped. Achieving the target for smoking would have a 
similar impact on men and women, reducing the risk of pre-
mature mortality by ≈4%. As among women, the BP goal 
also had the most profound impact on reducing premature 
mortality from CVD. The scenario if all 4 risk factor targets 
were achieved in 2025 resulted in achieving the overall goal 
by about 2025 for both men and women.
The regional variation in the probability rates for pre-
mature CVD mortality was striking, and the effects of 
achieving the targets are demonstrated in the figures. For 
high-income countries, among men and women (Figures 3 
and 4), the 2025 premature CVD mortality target was 
achieved if current trends continued but would be achieved 
≈5 years sooner if all 4 risk factors targets were achieved. 
Higher premature CVD mortality rates were estimated 
in Eastern Europe/Central Asia (Figures 5 and 6), sub-
Saharan Africa (Figures 7 and 8), North Africa/Middle 
East (Figures 9 and 10), South Asia (Figures 11 and 12), 
East Asia/Pacific (Figures 13 and 14), and Latin America/
Caribbean (Figures 15 and 16) if current trends continued. 
Achieving the 4 risk factor goals by 2025, however, resulted 
in the overall 25 by 25 target being achieved on average in 
high-income regions, North Africa/Middle East, East Asia/
Pacific, and Latin America/Caribbean for men and women. 
There is substantial measurement uncertainty for these esti-
mates, particularly in South Asia.
Discussion
The data illustrate the substantial variability in the global 
burden of premature mortality from CVD with much greater 
probability of cardiovascular death in low- and middle-
income countries than in high-income countries. Given that 
increased systolic BP, smoking, overweight and obesity, and 
DM are highly prevalent in many populations and increase 
the risk of CVD death,16 achieving all 4 of these risk factor 
targets will contribute to a reduction in the risk of prema-
ture mortality from CVD in about the year 2025 globally. A 
key finding of our exercise is that, globally and for almost 
regions, targeting all 4 of these risk factors leads to greater 
reductions in CVD death than targeting any single risk factor. 
However, the absolute impacts of the WHO 25 by 25 priority 
targets both in combination and independently differ signifi-
cantly by world region.
Globally, the targets for systolic BP (reduce by 25%) and 
tobacco use (reduce by 30%) have more substantial effects 
on the future scenarios compared with maintaining current 
levels of BMI and fasting plasma glucose. However, this 
general observation is not true for all regions, notably high-
income North America and Australasia, where a reduction 
in BMI among women dominates as a strategy.13 Tobacco 
reduction is the largest contributor to mortality reductions 
for women in Western Europe and high-income Asia Pacific 
and men in North Africa/Middle East, central sub-Saharan 
Africa, and Central Asia.13 Because there is substantial 
regional variability in these projections, regions and coun-
tries will need to develop, prioritize, implement, and evalu-
ate context-specific approaches to addressing these targets. 
Projections of future trends can be helpful for setting pri-
orities in certain regions. Although the order of importance 
of reaching the individual risk factors varies somewhat by 
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 1, 2019
 e678  Circulation  June 7, 2016
region, the uncertainty intervals largely overlap, and the best 
scenario for reaching the 25 by 25 goal is to accomplish all 
4 key risk factor targets.
Although the analyses focused on the 4 main risk fac-
tor targets, attention needs to be focused on the other targets 
that involve improving the capacities of healthcare systems 
to accomplish CVD risk reduction. Two of the WHO targets 
could not be modeled: 50% of eligible people receiving drug 
therapy and counseling, including glycemic control, to pre-
vent heart attacks and strokes and 80% availability of the 
affordable basic technologies and essential medicines, includ-
ing generics, required to treat major NCDs in both public and 
private facilities. It is also important to recognize in the inter-
pretation of the projections that many of the 8 WHO global 
targets are interdependent. For example, to achieve the 2025 
WHO targets for BP and DM, major efforts to strengthen 
healthcare systems will be required.
Policy Implications
There are several policy implications of these findings. First, 
these results demonstrate that the greatest reduction in prema-
ture mortality can be achieved for most regions of the world 
by targeting a combination of risk factors. Second, more 
ambitious risk factor targets will be needed for fasting plasma 
glucose and BMI if they are to make a substantial contribution 
to risk reduction. A more ambitious tobacco target would also 
influence non–cardiovascular-related deaths such as those 
secondary to cancer and chronic lung disease, which were not 
included here.
To reduce BP, all 3 pillars of the global strategy for the 
prevention and control of NCDs will be important to address: 
surveillance, prevention, and health care delivered through 
strengthened health systems. These recommendations are 
described in detail in prevention guidelines produced by 
multiple organizations6.7.16–19 and by the WHO in its pack-
age of essential NCD interventions for primary health care.17 
Prevention strategies and goals for reducing population 
mean levels of BP, including the WHO target of a 30% rela-
tive reduction in mean population intake of salt/sodium, are 
important components that can be provided largely by popu-
lation-wide interventions and policies aimed at improving the 
healthfulness, availability, and affordability of the local and 
regional food supply.
Third, projections of future mortality based on the best 
available data on risk factor exposure and relative risk can 
serve as a useful summary measure when WHO mem-
ber states and other stakeholders are setting priorities. To 
achieve the 25 by 25 mortality goal (Table 3), policy deci-
sions will need to reflect not only the cost-effectiveness of 
an intervention targeting a particular risk factor but also 
local trends in the absolute level of exposure to that risk 
factor. Additional investments in health surveillance will 
therefore be an essential component of evidence-based deci-
sion making.18,19

the modifiable risk factor targets. BP indicates blood pressure blood pressure;

prevention, improving access to evidence-based approaches 
to the management of risk to prevent and treat CVDs will 
be critical to achieving the 2025 goal. Risk-based manage-
ment for the identification and treatment of individuals 
at high risk for CVD and stroke events has been outlined 
by the WHO in its package of essential interventions for 
NCDs in low-resource settings. Strategies include non–
laboratory-based CVD risk assessment, simplified treat-
ment protocols based on drugs listed in the WHO Model 
List of Essential Medicines, regular audits of the adequacy 
of human resources, availability of equipment and labora-
tory reagents, adherence to clinical protocols, and main-
tenance of stock registers. Performance assessments show 
that implementation of the total-risk approach in primary 
health care can lead to significant improvements in BP and 
DM control and to reductions in cardiovascular risk. In col-
laboration with ministries of health, the WHO has initiated 
similar projects in primary care in ≈30 resource-constrained 
settings.19
Strengths and Limitations
The data and results from the GDB 2013 study that were 
used provide the most robust estimates to date of the global 
and regional burden of cause-specific mortality and risk 
factor prevalence. Mortality data from 1990 through 2013, 
as well as modeled estimates of risk factor exposure, were 
used to create these projections. However, this analysis has 
limitations.
First, the regional figures appear to have an inflection 
point present at 2014. The prediction of future mortality 
begins in the year 2014 because mortality data were avail-
able only through 2013 at the time of the analysis. In our 
time-series figures, we have elected to show both estimates 
of mortality from 1990 to 2013 and the results of our model. 
This inflection point reflects the fact that, for the purpose of 
comparison, we are showing results of the GBD 2013 study 
(in black) and results of our projection model (in colors) 
within the same figure.
Second, the projections reflect counterfactual scenarios 
based on the theoretical minimum risk assumed for each risk 
factor rather than the effect of specific interventions. Therefore, 
these estimates reflect the combined impact of prevention and 
treatment, rather than being limited to treatment of individuals 
already at elevated risk. This assumption reflects the fact that 
both prevention and medical care will play an essential part in 
reducing the burden of CVD.
Third, we created models for risk factor targets that were 
limited to those agreed on by United Nations member states 
in 2013 and those for which there were sufficient global data 
on exposure levels. 
Fourth, we restricted these analyses to reductions in pre-
mature CVD and stroke deaths. Other NCD goals, including 
reductions in cancer, DM, and respiratory diseases, were not 
estimated but are also essential to achieving the overall NCD 
goal. 
Fifth, although joint effects were accounted for in the 
scenario in which all targets are met, for the BMI scenario 
only, the direct effect of BMI was estimated on mortality, 
separate from its effects through BP and fasting plasma glu-
cose. The inclusion of all the downstream effects of high BMI 
would have shown this strategy to have an even larger impact. 
Because of this decision, however, the combined risk factor 
scenario was able to correctly account for the joint effects of 
the selected risk factors without overestimating the benefit of 
intervening on multiple metabolic risk factors.
Conclusions
By 2025, >5 million premature deaths from CVD among 
men and 2.8 million among women are projected world-
wide. Estimates of the number of people with premature 
death from CVD and the probability of dying in 2025 vary 
across the globe. These data demonstrate wide variation in 
estimated future trends in risk factor prevalence and pre-
mature CVD mortality that will require region- and coun-
try-specific priority setting to achieve the 25 by 25 goal. 
Cost-effective population-wide intervention strategies exist 
to reduce BP, tobacco use, obesity, and DM but have not 
been widely implemented. Aggressive strategies to achieve 
multiple WHO targets, especially for raised BP and tobacco 
control, will be required to meet the 25 by 25 overall goal. 
Success is possible if the individual WHO targets are met 
and healthcare systems are strengthened. Achieving these 
goals can be accomplished only if countries and regions set 
priorities, implement cost-effective population-wide strate-
gies, and collaborate in public-private partnerships across 
multiple sectors.
