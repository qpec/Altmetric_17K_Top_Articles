Abstract
Background: Against the background of the recruitment crisis in general practice, we aimed to determine what
United Kingdom (UK) medical students value in their future careers, how they perceive careers in general practice
(GP) and what influences them.
Methods: Cross-sectional survey of 280 final and penultimate year medical students at the University of Oxford,
with questions relating to career choices, factors of importance when choosing a career and attitudes towards
general practice as a career. Quantitative methods included cluster analysis, chi squared tests of independence and
logistic regression analysis. Qualitative data were analysed thematically using the Framework method.
Results: Response rate was 89% (280/315). 40% of participants said that general practice was an attractive or very
attractive career option. Respondents valued job satisfaction, work-life balance and close relationships with patients.
However, fewer than 20% of respondents agreed that community-based working was important to them and many
(often citing particular GPs they had observed) felt that general practice as currently structured may not be
satisfying or fulfilling because of high workload, financial pressures and externally imposed directives. 63%
perceived GPs to have lower status than hospital specialties and 49% thought the overall culture of their medical
school had negatively influenced their views towards general practice. Some respondents considered that general
practice would not be intellectually challenging or compatible with a research career; some appeared to have had
limited exposure to academic primary care.
Conclusions: With the caveat that this was a sample from a single medical school, medical students may be put
off careers in general practice by three main things: low perceived value of community-based working and low
status of general practice (linked to a prevailing medical school culture); observing the pressures under which GPs
currently work; and lack of exposure to academic role models and primary care-based research opportunities. To
improve recruitment of the next generation of GPs, medical schools must provide high quality placements in
general practice, expose students to academic role models and highlight to policymakers the links between the
current pressures in UK general practice and the recruitment crisis.

 Background
UK general practice is experiencing a crisis in recruit-
ment and retention at a time of unprecedented demand.
Health Education England has mandated that 50% of
medical graduates should enter general practice [1] but
no medical school is close to achieving this. This reflects
a worldwide trend in which generalism is becoming less
popular than specialism, with reports of shortages of
GPs or family doctors in the United States (US) [2],
Canada [3], Australia [4] and elsewhere.
Many reasons have been suggested for the recruitment
crisis in general practice. Medical school factors can be
thought of in relation to the three curricula defined by
Hafferty: the formal, the informal and the hidden [5].
The formal curriculum may favour specialities through
the disproportionate amount of time spent in hospital
placements. This in turn limits exposure to the informal
curriculum (ad-hoc, unscripted, interpersonal teaching)
within primary care. Particular attention has been paid
to the hidden curriculum: the “set of influences that
function at the level of organisational structure and cul-
ture” [5]. The idea of “ending up” in primary care or be-
ing “just a GP” may stem from and be perpetuated by
the subtle denigration (so-called “badmouthing”) of gen-
eral practice that students and junior doctors encounter
on hospital rotations [6–8]. A US study compared 20
medical schools and found that students attending
schools with higher levels of “badmouthing” were less
likely subsequently to practice primary care [9]. In the
UK, certain medical schools have traditionally had low
rates of progression to general practice [10] leading to
accusations of “rank discrimination” against this career
option [11].
External factors contributing to the recruitment crisis
include the current pressures on primary care, linked to
falling investment in real terms. Fewer than half of UK
GPs report being satisfied with their job - the lowest
proportion since 2001 [12]. Moreover, the appeal of hos-
pital practice may have increased with the introduction
of restrictions in working hours, at a cost to general
practice recruitment [13, 14].
The UK Medical Schools Council has collaborated on
two reports aiming to shed light on the complex medical
school environment and frame solutions to the recruit-
ment crisis. In 2016, “By Choice, Not by Chance” identi-
fied
three
key
issues:
“tribalism”,
“negativism”
and
financing of undergraduate education [6]. In 2017, a grey
literature report “Destination GP”, based on an online
survey across several UK medical schools, highlighted
the role of peers and role models, badmouthing and mis-
information about primary care and the medico-political
climate [15].
This study aimed to determine the views of medical
students at Oxford University towards their future
careers in general, and general practice in particular, in
order to inform curriculum planning at Oxford and also
contribute to the wider knowledge base.
Methods
A cross-sectional study into the attitudes of Oxford
medical students towards their future careers and
general practice was conducted. Ethical approval for
the study was obtained from University of Oxford
Central University Research Ethics Committee (5/5/
2016, R45420/RE001).
Based on findings in previous literature (see Background)
, a 19-item questionnaire (Additional file 1) was designed
which combined dichotomous, multiple choice, demo-
graphic and Likert response scale questions with free text
questions. Minor refinements were made after piloting the
questionnaire with 4 individuals. In May 2016, an invitation
to participate in the survey was sent to all the final and pen-
ultimate year students by email, alongside an introductory
letter. At the time of receiving the questionnaire, all stu-
dents would either be doing or have done an 8-week com-
munity block, which included 3 days a week in general
practice for 6 weeks (year 5 GP placement), under the
supervision of a single GP (year 5 GP tutor).
The survey was open for six weeks. Reminders were
sent to non-responders and completion of the question-
naire was considered consent to participate in the study.
Research questions addressed in the survey centred
around: career choices and influencing factors, socio-
demographic factors, research ambitions and the attract-
iveness and status of general practice.
Quantitative data were analysed using R, SPSS and
Excel. A cluster analysis in R was conducted to deter-
mine whether career interests showed some form of
grouping. A chi-square test of independence was per-
formed using Excel to examine the relationship between
attractiveness of general practice as a potential career
and gender, course type (standard 6-year course vs.
graduate-entry 4-year course) and school type (non-se-
lective state school in UK vs. selective state school in UK
vs. private school in the UK vs. other). Further chi-
squared tests were performed in Excel to determine the
independence of the attractiveness of general practice
and a) the perception of the professional status of GPs
compared to hospital specialists, and b) the perceived
overall culture of the medical school. A logistic regres-
sion analysis was completed in SPSS. We modelled the
association between the attractiveness of a career in gen-
eral practice (attractive or very attractive = 1) and a list
of importance factors (Q4) and influencing factors
(Q10). We performed separate models for each, one for
influencing and one for importance factors and then
combined those variables regarded as positively associ-
ated in a final model using a stepwise approach. In this

 way, we show that both the importance and influencing
factors work independently, rather than competing as
explanatory factors.
A thematic analysis of the qualitative data was under-
taken using the Framework method [16], guided by a
qualitative expert (TG). The free text data (which con-
sisted of brief one- or two-sentence responses to open-
ended questions) were transferred to a Word document
and then pasted into Excel spreadsheets under a series
of thematic headings. As the analysis developed, some
headings were combined and others split into further
sub-themes. In this way, the coding developed iteratively
and became more refined as successive responses were
added. We applied the theoretical notion of the hidden
curriculum to inform the analysis.
Results
Overview of sample
Two hundred eighty students participated in the study,
giving an overall response rate of 89%. 49% of partici-
pants were female; 85% were on the standard 6-year
course (rather than the 4-year graduate-entry course).
Responders did not differ significantly from the overall
student population in these proportions (47% and 84%
respectively). Over 30% of responders had attended non-
selective state schools, 20% selective state schools and
43% private schools in the UK; 6% had attended second-
ary school outside of the UK, and 1% did not fit into
these categories. 80% of responders provided some free-
text responses (1066 comments in total), thus providing
a very rich set of qualitative data.
Quantitative data
Figure 1 shows the proportion of responders considering
each career option. The median number of career
choices selected was 3, from a list of 15 (unlimited
choice), with 45% of respondents indicating that they
were considering a career in general practice. No
clusters were found in these data. 70% of participants in-
dicated that they started to consider their career options
during clinical school (years 4–6). 51% of students had
applied or were considering applying for a training post
that included protected research time.
Ten percent of respondents rated general practice as very
attractive as a potential career choice; 30% rated it as attract-
ive, 28% as neutral, 24% as unattractive and 9% as very un-
attractive. These responses showed no significant relationship
with gender (p = 0.10), type of course (p = 0.16) or school
type (p = 0.12) in a chi squared test of independence.
When asked to compare the status of general practice
to that of hospital specialists, 63% felt it was lower, 31%
about the same, and 5% did not know. 0% said higher.
There was no significant relationship between perceived
attractiveness of general practice as a potential career
and the perception of the professional status of GPs
compared to hospital specialists (p = 0.25).
Participants were asked what factors they valued in a
career. For some factors, this could be directly compared
to the likelihood of a factor being offered by a career in
general practice. This is shown in Fig. 2. Factors, ordered
in importance from most to least, were as follows: job
satisfaction (99% agree or strongly agree), teamwork
(79%), flexibility in location (78%), reasonable working
hours and close relationship with patients (74%), career
development (72%), income potential (62%), research
opportunities (55%), professional status (48%), length of
training (44%) and community-based working (19%).
Factors thought likely to be associated with a career in
general practice were ordered in likelihood from most to
least as follows: close relationship with patients (95%
agree or strongly agree), reasonable working hours (69%)
, job satisfaction (49%), teamwork (46%), higher income
(29%), career development (25%), professional status
(23%) and research opportunities (19%). Notably, almost
50% of students were uncertain about income as a GP
compared to hospital specialties.

 Figure 3 shows the Likert scale responses to different
influencing factors. The most positive influencing factor
was the year 5 GP placement (average rating score 2.09
where strongly positive =1 and strongly negative = 5).
The most negative influencing factor was the current
medico-political climate (average rating score 3.53). No
significant relationship between the attractiveness of
general practice as a potential career and the perception
of the overall culture of the medical school (p = 0.24)
was found.
The logistic regression analysis found that the best
fitting explanatory variables for the attractiveness of
a career in general practice included in the final
single model were the following factors: the year 5
GP placement, community-based working, reason-
able working hours and the current medico-political
climate. This final model predicted 73% of the re-
sponses correctly (Additional file 2).
Qualitative data
A striking feature of the free text responses was that
very few responders made exclusively negative state-
ments. Most made a combination of positive and nega-
tive statements, often in the same sentence (e.g. “If it
was just the clinical aspects, GP would be perfect. How-
ever, the social / government nonsense is enough to put
me off” [S11]), suggesting that at this stage in their ca-
reers, students were still weighing up the pros and cons
of general practice as a career option. It was also striking
that whilst some perceptions expressed in the free text
data could be attributed clearly to the formal medical
school curriculum (e.g. “facts” that the students had

 learnt on their general practice placements), most of the
free text statements were more closely aligned with the
“hidden curriculum” of unconscious and incidental influ-
ences beyond what was formally or intentionally taught.
Three positive perceptions of general practice, which
were widely but not universally held, were an expect-
ation of good work-life balance, salary and/or job secur-
ity, and a high degree of professional fulfilment and
autonomy (“Typically I imagine a better working environ-
ment and better hours and more control” [S30]). Some
respondents who expressed a strong preference for a
career in hospital medicine or surgery described general
practice as a good back-up plan (“…I certainly would be
open to converting to GP job at a later stage…” [S186]).
Most negative statements about general practice could
be divided into four over-arching categories that reso-
nated strongly with the statistically significant findings
from the quantitative data: a strong preference for a dif-
ferent career; perceptions about the current reality of
general practice in the UK; perceptions about the gener-
alist and professionally isolated nature of general prac-
tice; and perceived low status of general practice. We
consider these in turn.
Some students had already developed a strong preference
for a different career. They gave good personal reasons for
this (e.g. the technical challenges of surgery or strong in-
spiration from a role model in a particular clinical spe-
cialty); these students rejected general practice primarily
because their interests lay elsewhere. However, firm com-
mitment to a specific career was uncommon in this cohort.
Many students felt that a potentially fulfilling and
family-friendly career option, general practice, was cur-
rently in serious jeopardy because of long hours, high
stress and numerous external directives that would
reduce their sense of autonomy. These perceptions ap-
peared to be the result of the student’s direct experience
on their general practice attachment or (in some cases)
observing a GP parent (“The hours are brutal (14 hour
days!) despite the idea of it being more ‘family friendly’…”
[S54]). Many students said changes in working condi-
tions would make them more likely to consider general
practice (“…[if] there wasn’t a mountain of paperwork
and we would get more than a few minutes with each
patient…” [S11]).
Respondents expressed a range of divergent views on
general practice as a “generalism”. Some believed that
generalism would provide professional fulfilment by ex-
posing them to a wide variety of conditions and intellec-
tual challenges (“…I felt that the variety in work [types of
patients/health needs] was attractive as well, especially
the diagnostic challenge and juggling uncertainty and
risk…” [S136]). Others viewed generalism negatively, de-
fining it in terms of minor and uninteresting ailments
(“Lots of necessary but tedious consultations...” [S18]),
with referral of [more interesting] complex cases to spe-
cialists (“Don’t get to the bottom of problems – refer up
the chain” [S85]). This depiction of general practice as
dealing with “easy” and mundane cases and passing the
“difficult” and intellectually challenging ones to special-
ists contrasted with comments from other students who
saw general practice as one of the most challenging
careers
both
intellectually
(“…breadth
of
knowledge
requires is very daunting” [S81]) and logistically (“Very
difficult job, the idea of seeing a patient in 10 minutes
seems overwhelming, and I would be worried I’d miss
things and patients would feel rushed” [S96]).
Some students appeared to associate general practice
with professional isolation (“I’d be worried it would be a

negative (right)

 bit lonely and unsupported” [S20]) and with an absence
of intellectual stimulation and research opportunities
(“Would like to do a PhD later in my career and GP
would limit this” [S69]). Interestingly, these statements
were often couched in speculative terms and made from
what appeared to be a position of ignorance (“…there is
less opportunity to be ‘academic’ as far as I know” [S90]).
The culture of the medical school and attitudes of hos-
pital doctors were often cited as negative influences on
students’ perceptions of general practice (“… ‘We’re not
training you to become GPs’ was one quote in a lecture”
[S130] and “Most medical students and Oxford Medical
School/JR [John Radcliffe] consultants are rather dismis-
sive about ‘GP land’” [S136]). Some students criticised
the badmouthing of GPs (“Negative attitudes from sec-
ondary care professionals towards GPs are not uncom-
mon. I dislike these attitudes which are often unfounded”
[S147]), but acknowledged its effect (“I don’t consider
them [GPs] inferior, but I feel inevitably its influence [sic]
me” [S249]). Most students reported that they had had a
positive experience during their year 5 GP placement,
and many named a particular GP (most commonly, their
GP tutor) as a person who had particularly encouraged
them to consider general practice as a career option (“I
have known a handful of GPs which I consider to be of
the most inspiring people I’ve met in my medical training
so far…” [S32]). A few students named GP trainees as
positive role models (“…they show that young people do
go into GP and are good advocates for the job” [S20]). In
sum, negative comments from specialists about general
practice in general were offset (to some degree at least)
by inspirational role models from particular GPs. Less
commonly, students depicted a specific GP as uninspir-
ing (“My personal GP has been quite dismissive and un-
helpful” [S78]).
This overall picture was sometimes complicated, how-
ever, by comments from students who reported GPs (in-
cluding their own GP tutor) directly discouraging them
from considering primary care (“Unfortunately every GP
placement I have been on, my tutors have advised
against it and said they do not enjoy their job” [S200])
and by observing stress and burnout in particular GPs
(“…I cannot help but see how my father, who is a GP
nearing the end of his career, has been jaded by signifi-
cant changes to the job in the past ten years. He is an ex-
tremely positive person, but it seems clear that doctors
like him have been abused lately…” [S225]).
In sum, analysis of free text responses reveals that the
students in our sample appeared to have been strongly
influenced by both the formal curriculum (the clinical
case load of general practice and exposure to a general-
ism) and a troubling hidden curriculum in which general
practice was “badmouthed” by specialists and experi-
enced as stressful, lacking autonomy and unfulfilling.
Discussion
Summary of principal findings
Forty percent of surveyed students considered general
practice a potentially attractive career option. However, a
subsequent survey of career destination of this cohort sug-
gests that only 14% of them entered general practice [17].
This falls significantly short of the Health Education Eng-
land goal of 50% of new graduates entering general
practice.
Through logistic regression analysis we found four key
explanatory variables to explain attractiveness of general
practice, which are overlapping and link to wider
themes. First, the value of community-based working.
Clearly this is fundamental to general practice, so it is
particularly concerning that less than one-fifth of stu-
dents rate it as important in choosing a career and few
students explicitly refer to community working in their
free text responses. Second, the importance of reason-
able working hours. A factor valued highly by respon-
dents, and still associated with general practice by many.
However, this is under threat from the third variable
identified: the influence of the current medico-political
climate. This was rated as the most negative influencing
factor in the quantitative analysis. The free text re-
sponses further support our interpretation that students
are fearful of the uncertain future for primary care
within the National Health Service, and already have
begun to see the erosion of its positive elements as they
observe the pressures under which GPs currently work.
The fourth variable was the year 5 GP placement. The
quantitative results demonstrate the positive influence
this was on the majority of students, with some GP tu-
tors proving to be inspirational role models. However,
the free text responses also reveal the extreme negative
impact of some GPs who have directly warned students
to seek careers in other specialties, or were visibly
stressed and disillusioned at work.
Much of the motivation for this study was to explore
the role of status and medical school culture. Neither
emerged as key explanatory variables for the attractive-
ness of general practice. Nevertheless, there is indisput-
able evidence that students view GPs to have lower
status than hospital consultants, and direct quotes in
free texts confirm examples of this being reinforced
within the teaching institution. Hospital consultants are
seen as a more negative influence than either neutral or
positive, with examples of badmouthing provided by the
qualitative data. The role of medical students is less
clear. As an influencing factor the majority of students
described their peers as neutral. A handful of free text
responses allude to a negative peer effect.
The low status of GPs may relate to the negative view of
generalism held by some students; that is the belief that
general practice work would be easy, dull and devoid of

development
or
research
(allegedly reinforced by negative stereotypes from hospital
doctors). It appears that GPs are unable to quash this
view, either because of limited interactions with students
(academic GPs are a largely unknown entity to students)
or due to low morale, desperation and burn out.
Strengths and weaknesses in relation to other studies
and comparison of results
This study contributes to the growing literature on med-
ical student attitudes towards primary care, both in the
UK [6, 13, 15, 18–20] and internationally [21–25]. It has
one of the highest response rates (89%) and through the
inclusion of open questions has generated a rich qualita-
tive data set of over 1000 free text responses.
However, the cluster analysis failed to identify sub-
groups of individuals with similar career aspirations.
This may be because students maintain broad career
plans during medical school, however it is plausible that
the data set is too small to identify any such groupings,
should they exist. Indeed, a sample size of 280 is small
compared to the larger UK and international studies.
The reports supported by the Medical School Council
– “By Choice, Not by Chance” [6] and “Destination
GP” [15], included students from up to 30 medical
schools, improving the generalisability of their find-
ings within the country. However, these were not
peer-reviewed studies.
Similarities between our study and others both in the
UK and abroad suggest our results do not reflect just
local issues. Tribalism and badmouthing of general prac-
tice is not unique to Oxford [6, 8, 15], and the low pres-
tige of primary care compared to hospital specialities is
not unique to the UK [19, 25]. In addition, the important
role of GPs themselves as role models (both positive and
negative) has been highlighted in numerous other stud-
ies [18, 20, 23]. The effect of peer-to-peer influence was
highlighted by the recent “Destination GP” report: “91%
of students believe that their peers hold negative views
about general practice” and “35% of students indicated
their peers at medical school as one of the most in-
fluential groups…” [15]. Our study did not appear to
show such a strong effect of peer-to-peer influence.
This may represent a real difference, but direct com-
parison is limited between questions with different
constructs. Moreover, the above report also found
that 51% of students believed that their peers held
positive views about general practice, so peer influ-
ence may not necessarily be negative.
Our study considered the influence of three demo-
graphic
variables:
sex,
course
type
(standard
vs.
graduate-entry) and school type. No effect of gender was
found, in contrast to previous studies showing female
medical students are more likely to favour general
practice [13]. However, our study did not assess age, eth-
nicity, place of birth or seniority at medical school as
factors influencing career choice. There is evidence from
other studies that these variables may be influential, in
particular that attitudes towards general practice change
during medical school [13]. Our decision to combine re-
sults from final and penultimate year students (to pro-
duce a larger sample) meant that this study was unable
to tease out any age effect.
Meaning of the study: implications for clinicians and
policymakers
Factors external to medical schools – such as the pres-
sures on GPs and the low morale of the workforce –
must be meaningfully addressed alongside any other ini-
tiative aiming to improve recruitment. For the factors in-
ternal to medical schools, this study reinforces the
findings from other recently published reports, and sup-
ports many of the recommendations made.
Our study shows that community-based working is
poorly valued by respondents. There is evidence from
the UK of a positive correlation between the number of
“authentic” (i.e. in a practice, with patient contact) ses-
sions in general practice at medical school and progres-
sion to general practice [26]. Oxford falls into the lowest
quarter for number of authentic sessions in general prac-
tice amongst UK medical schools [26]. Similarly, data
from the US suggest that longer, more immersive com-
munity placements make students more likely to choose
general practice [27]. We support the urgent call to re-
evaluate funding systems in medical schools in order to
provide longer, high quality community placements with
motivated GPs who have the attitudes and personal
qualities to be inspirational role models [6, 7].
The issue of tribalism splits opinion. Given the evi-
dence that it impacts career choice [8], some have called
for zero tolerance towards the badmouthing of general
practice [28]. Others worry that “playing the denigration
card risks GPs being perceived as victims”, which may
be detrimental to the cause [29]. We support measures
to increase awareness of, and resilience to, negative de-
pictions of general practice by other specialties.
However, we also advocate positive action by GPs
themselves. Our study has confirmed the central role
GPs play in shaping medical student attitudes. As such,
we suggest three approaches: greater involvement of
GPs in clinical and non-clinical teaching throughout
medical school, utilising GP trainees as “near peer”
teachers and positive role models, and enhancing the
profile of academic primary care within the teaching in-
stitution. At a university with a world leading depart-
ment of academic primary care, it is alarming that some
Oxford students believe that working in general practice
limits research opportunities. Finally, like the recent
Barber et al. BMC Medical Education  (2018) 18:160 
Page 7 of 9
 Medical School Council reports [6, 15], we believe that
supporting student-led GP societies will create a positive
peer-to-peer effect and promote general practice as a
dynamic, varied and stimulating career.
Unanswered questions and future research
There is evidence from the UK and US that longer
placements in general practice increase progression to
this career choice [26, 27]. Future research should evalu-
ate the effect of exposure to near-peer (GP trainees) and
academic role models, as well as focusing on what
makes a quality clinical placement in general practice.
Conclusions
This study, from a single UK medical school, confirms
and updates previous research from the UK and else-
where that far fewer soon-to-graduate medical students
are seriously considering general practice as a career
than are needed for the future workforce. The majority
of students neither value community-based working, nor
view general practice as a prestigious career. Medical
schools have a responsibility to address their formal cur-
riculum (notably the short time which students spend in
general practice compared with hospital specialties, and
limited
exposure
to
academic
primary
care
and
community-based research), but also the powerful “hidden
curriculum”, including negative stereotyping by hospital
specialists. Wider factors must also be addressed: exposure
to GPs who are burnt out and disillusioned by the current
pressures facing primary care has a profound and lasting
negative effect. Clearly, improvements in GP recruitment
require improvements in the working lives of GPs.
