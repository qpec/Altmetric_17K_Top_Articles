BACKGROUND: Among patients with clinically manifest vascular disease, 
the risk of recurrent vascular events is likely to vary. We assessed the 
distribution of estimated 10-year risk of recurrent vascular events in a 
secondary prevention population. We also estimated the potential risk 
reduction and residual risk that can be achieved if patients reach guideline-
recommended risk factor targets.
METHODS: The SMART score (Second Manifestations of Arterial 
Disease) for 10-year risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or vascular 
death was applied to 6904 patients with vascular disease. The risk score 
was externally validated in 18 
436 patients with various manifestations 
of vascular disease from the TNT (Treating to New Targets), IDEAL 
(Incremental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering), 
SPARCL (Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol 
Levels), and CAPRIE (Clopidogrel Versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of 
Ischemic Events) trials. The residual risk at guideline-recommended 
targets was estimated by applying relative risk reductions from meta-
analyses to the estimated risk for targets for systolic blood pressure, 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, physical activity, and use of 
antithrombotic agents.
RESULTS: The external performance of the SMART risk score was 
reasonable, apart from overestimation of risk in patients with 10-year risk 
>40%. In patients with various manifestations of vascular disease, median 
10-year risk of a recurrent major vascular event was 17% (interquartile 
range, 11%–28%), varying from <10% in 18% to >30% in 22% of the 
patients. If risk factors were at guideline-recommended targets, the 
residual 10-year risk would be <10% in 47% and >30% in 9% of the 
patients (median, 11%; interquartile range, 7%–17%).
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with vascular disease, there is very 
substantial variation in estimated 10-year risk of recurrent vascular events. 
If all modifiable risk factors were at guideline-recommended targets, half 
of the patients would have a 10-year risk <10%. These data suggest that 
even with optimal treatment, many patients with vascular disease will 
remain at >20% and even >30% 10-year risk, clearly delineating an area of 
substantial unmet medical need.

P
atients with a clinical manifestation of vascular dis-
ease are generally considered to be at equally high 
risk of recurrent major vascular events and mortal-
ity.1,2 To reduce this risk, guidelines recommend strict 
targets for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and 
blood pressure, as well as for lifestyle risk factors.1,2 
Whereas previous reports have demonstrated consider-
able variation in the risk of future vascular events in the 
primary prevention setting,3,4 little is known about the 
distribution of risk in patients with known vascular dis-
ease. Vascular event rates have declined over the last 
few decades.5 With the emergence of novel therapeutic 
options for the prevention of (recurrent) vascular events 
such as anti-inflammatory agents and proprotein con-
vertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors,6,7 the question 
arises of whether patients with vascular disease can all 
be considered at high vascular risk, particularly if they 
are treated according to current guidelines. Insight into 
risk distributions, residual risk, and the additional risk 
reduction achieved with guideline-recommended targets 
may provide essential information to guide clinicians to 
the best therapeutic approach.
In the present study, we estimated the variation in 10-
year risk of recurrent vascular events among patients 
with clinically manifest vascular disease (coronary artery 
disease [CAD], cerebrovascular disease [CVD], periph-
eral artery disease [PAD], or an abdominal aortic aneu-
rysm [AAA]) using the SMART risk score (Second Mani-
festations of Arterial Disease).8 The SMART risk score 
was recently developed, and external validity is essential 
before widespread use is justified. Therefore, we tested 
the performance of the SMART risk score in 3 external 
populations of patients with vascular disease originating 
from the TNT (Treating to New Targets), IDEAL (Incre-
mental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid 
Lowering), SPARCL (Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Re-
duction in Cholesterol Levels), and CAPRIE (Clopidogrel 
Versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events) tri-
als.9–12 Furthermore, we estimated the risk reduction that 
might be achieved by reaching guideline-recommended 
risk factor targets and provide estimates of the residual 
risk in the secondary prevention setting.
MethODs
study Population
Study participants originated from the SMART study, an ongo-
ing prospective cohort study at the University Medical Center 
Utrecht in the Netherlands. A detailed description was pub-
lished previously.13 For the present study, we used data from 
6904 patients enrolled between 1996 and 2013. At enroll-
ment, patients were 18 to 80 years of age and were in a sta-
ble phase after a clinical manifestation of vascular disease, 
including CAD (n=3282), CVD (n=1491), PAD (n=805), an 
AAA (n=255), or polyvascular disease (vascular disease in ≥2 
locations; n=1071).8,13 We excluded patients with a terminal 
malignancy and those who were not independent in activities 
of daily living or not sufficiently fluent in the Dutch language for 
purposes of informed consent. Risk factors were measured at 
enrollment with questionnaires, blood samples, and physical 
examination. More details on definitions of vascular disease, 
outcomes, and inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented 
in Tables I through III in the online-only Data Supplement. The 
SMART study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki; the 
University Medical Center Utrecht Ethics Committee approved 
the study; and all participants gave written informed consent.
risk of recurrent Vascular events
The estimated 10-year risk of the composite outcome of myo-
cardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death was calcu-
lated with the SMART risk score (Methods in the online-only 
Data Supplement) based on the following predictors: age; sex; 
current smoking; diabetes mellitus; systolic blood pressure 
(mm 
Hg); total cholesterol (mmol/L); high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (mmol/L); presence of CAD, CVD, PAD, or AAA; 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (mL·min−1·1.73 m−2); high-
sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP; mg/L); and years since 
clinical Perspective
What is new?
• Among patients with clinically manifest vascular 
disease, there is substantial variation in esti-
mated 10-year risk of a recurrent major vascular 
event (myocardial infarction, stroke, or vascular 
death), with 18% of the patients at <10% 10-year 
risk and 22% at >30% 10-year risk.
• If all vascular risk factors were at recommended 
targets according to secondary prevention 
guidelines, the 10-year residual risk would be 
estimated to be <10% for half of the patients 
with vascular disease.
• However, even with optimal treatment, many 
patients with vascular disease will remain at 
>20% and even >30% 10-year risk.
What are the clinical implications?
• The general assumption that all patients with vas-
cular disease are at high risk of recurrent vascu-
lar events needs to be refined.
• In particular, with the emergence of novel options 
for further risk reduction such as anti-inflamma-
tory agents and proprotein convertase subtilisin/
kexin type 9 inhibitors, a single secondary pre-
vention strategy for all patients with vascular dis-
ease may no longer be appropriate.
• Novel risk stratification approaches may be used 
to individualize secondary prevention by iden-
tifying high-risk patients to target those most 
likely to derive the greatest benefit from novel 
interventions.

the first manifestation of vascular disease.8 The estimated 
risks were plotted in histograms to show the variation in risk 
graphically. Because the risk of recurrent events is known to 
vary between patients with vascular disease in different loca-
tions, analyses were also performed with stratification for the 
location of vascular disease.
external Validity of the sMart risk score
We tested the external validity of the SMART risk score in 3 pop-
ulations: in 9447 patients with CAD from the usual-dose statin 
arm of the TNT and IDEAL trials (http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov, 
unique identifiers NCT00327691 and NCT00159835),11,12 
in 2366 patients with CVD from the placebo arm of the 
SPARCL trial (http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov, unique identifier 
NCT00147602),9 and in 6623 patients with PAD from both arms 
of the CAPRIE trial.10 It is notable that no suitable cohorts of 
patients with AAA or polyvascular disease were available for the 
present analyses (Methods in the online-only Data Supplement). 
Although patients with AAA (n=429) or polyvascular disease 
(n=4388) were represented in the 3 validation populations, fur-
ther validation studies in these patient populations are required. 
Performance was assessed in terms of calibration (the agree-
ment between predicted and observed risks) and discrimination 
(the extent to which patients who developed an event also had 
higher estimated risk than patients that did not experience the 
event of interest). Details are provided in the Methods section 
and Tables I through IV in the online-only Data Supplement.
risk Factor targets From secondary Prevention 
guidelines
Targets were based on the European Society of Cardiology 
guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical 
practice (version 2012) and the 2011 updated American Heart 
Association/American College of Cardiology Foundation sec-
ondary prevention guidelines.1,2 The 6 targets recommended 
for all patients with vascular disease are smoking cessation, 
LDL cholesterol (<2.6 mmol/L for high-risk patients and <1.8 
mmol/L for very-high-risk patients), systolic blood pressure 
(<140 mm 
Hg) and diastolic blood pressure (<90 mm 
Hg), use 
of at least 1 antiplatelet or anticoagulant agent, moderate-inten-
sity physical activity (30 minutes at least 5 times a week, equiv-
alent to 11.25 metabolic equivalents of task [METs]), and body 
mass index (between 18.5 and 25 kg/m2; Table V in the online-
only Data Supplement). The hemoglobin A1c target for patients 
with diabetes mellitus was not taken into account because the 
literature on the effect of hemoglobin A1c lowering on major 
vascular events in patients with vascular disease is limited. 
One therapeutic meta-analysis and 1 observational study that 
evaluated this relation showed no clear association.14,15
residual risk if Patients are at guideline-
recommended risk Factor targets
Estimates of the reducible and residual risks obtained by 
achieving guideline-recommended risk factor targets were 
derived from previous studies, as presented in Table V in the 
online-only Data Supplement. For the blood pressure, lipid, 
and antithrombotic/anticoagulant targets, effects from meta-
analyses of randomized trials were used.16–19 For smoking 
cessation, a relative risk reduction of 0.74 was derived from 
a study in patients with CAD.20 This is a relatively conservative 
estimate compared with a meta-analysis that showed hazard 
ratios of 0.68 for myocardial infarction and 0.64 for mortality 
separately.21 This hazard ratio was chosen to prevent overop-
timistic estimations of the reducible risk in these patients. For 
physical activity improvement, we used the effect on major vas-
cular events in patients with diabetes mellitus with and without 
a history of vascular disease.22 For the weight target, no effect 
on major vascular events was assumed because in secondary 
prevention settings the effect of intentional weight loss is not 
proven.23 Moreover, the beneficial effects of weight reduction 
are also captured in the targets for physical activity, lipids, and 
systolic blood pressure. In addition, we considered potential 
associations between risk factors, that is, whether modifying 1 
risk factor also influenced the levels of other risk factors (Table 
VI in the online-only Data Supplement). On the basis of the avail-
able literature, we concluded that an increase in physical activ-
ity is likely to influence a patient’s blood pressure.24 Therefore, 
we performed a sensitivity analysis excluding the physical 
activity target from the analyses. It is important to note that we 
assumed that there were no interactions between the effects 
of risk factor modification on the reduction of vascular risk 
because data on potential interactions are limited and, across 
those subgroups examined, the relative risk reductions applied 
in the present study showed no clear heterogeneity.16–18
statistical analysis
Analyses were performed with R statistical software version 
3.1.1.13 Missing data were imputed with 10-fold multiple impu-
tation by predictive mean matching (R-package MICE), including 
other predictors and the outcome, assuming that these values 
were missing at random, and were pooled with the use of Rubin 
rules.25,26 In this method, the imputed value is taken from the 
observed values in the data set that are nearest to the predicted 
value of the missing variable based on covariate and outcome 
data. Missing data in SMART were ≤1% for smoking status, sys-
tolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol, estimated glomerular filtration rate, METs, history 
of CAD, CVD, or PAD, and years since first diagnosis of vascu-
lar disease; 2% for hsCRP; and 4% for LDL cholesterol. Missing 
data were <1% of each variable in the CAD external validation 
population; <1% for systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and estimated glomerular 
filtration rate and 47% for CRP in the CVD external validation 
population; and <1% for years since first manifestation of vas-
cular disease and estimated glomerular filtration rate, 7% for 
total cholesterol, 64% for systolic blood pressure and 71% for 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the PAD external valida-
tion population. In the PAD validation population, the variable 
years since first manifestation of vascular disease applied to 
years since first manifestation of PAD even if patients also had 
CAD or CVD. For the unavailable variable hsCRP in the CAD 
and PAD validation cohorts, we imputed age-, sex-, and vas-
cular disease–specific median values of hsCRP based on data 
from the SMART study (details are provided in Methods in the 
online-only Data Supplement). External validity of the SMART 
risk score was evaluated in terms of discrimination and calibra-
tion as described in detail in Methods in the online-only Data 
Supplement. Reducible and residual risks were calculated from

the estimated 10-year risks and expected relative risk reduc-
tions for each target on the basis of previous literature (Table V 
in the online-only Data Supplement). A detailed patient example 
of the calculations is provided in Table VII in the online-only Data 
Supplement. For the lipid goal, we first estimated the off-treat-
ment LDL cholesterol level for patients who were already on 
lipid-lowering therapy on the basis of the average percentage 
LDL cholesterol reduction that is associated with the therapy 
that a patient already received.27 Guideline-recommended con-
trol was defined as reaching a 50% reduction LDL cholesterol1 
or reaching the target of 2.6 mmol/L (high-risk patients) or 1.8 
mmol/L (very-high-risk patients)1,2 if this was a <50% reduc-
tion. On the basis of the estimated individual reduction of LDL 
cholesterol, a patient-specific relative risk reduction was used 
to estimate 10-year reducible and residual risks (Table VII in the 
online-only Data Supplement).17 For the blood pressure target, 
a similar approach was applied: Guideline-recommended con-
trol was defined as a maximum of 3 different classes of blood 
pressure–lowering agents for which an average reduction in 
systolic blood pressure was assumed27 or reaching the target 
of <140 mm 
Hg if this was achieved with <3 agents. On the 
basis of the estimated systolic blood pressure reduction, the 
average effect of blood pressure–lowering agents on major 
vascular events per 5–mm 
Hg reduction in systolic blood pres-
sure (hazard ratio of 0.83) was used to estimate the reducible 
risk.
Because guideline recommendations for treatment targets 
have changed over time, we performed a sensitivity analy-
sis in the subset of patients enrolled in the period of 2008 
to 2013, which is after the publication of the second most 
recent European Society of Cardiology and American Heart 
Association/American College of Cardiology Foundation guide-
lines for secondary prevention.28,29
results
Patient characteristics
Patient characteristics are shown stratified for their esti-
mated risk in Table 1 and for location of vascular disease 
in Table 2. On average, patients in the SMART cohort 
were 60 years old (SD, 10 years); 74% were male; 32% 
were current smokers; and 18% had a history of diabe-
tes mellitus. Sixty percent of the patients had a history 
of CAD, 29% had CVD, 19% had PAD, and 9% had an 
AAA. Of these patients, 16% had vascular disease in ≥2 
locations.
Variation in estimated 10-Year risk of recurrent 
Vascular events in Patients With Vascular 
Disease
There was wide variation in estimated 10-year risk of 
recurrent vascular events and mortality in patients with 
vascular disease, varying from <5% to >50% (median es-
timated risk, 17%; interquartile range [IQR], 11%–28%; 
Figure 1). Of the patients, 18% had a 10-year risk <10%, 
whereas 22% were at >30% 10-year risk. The estimated 
risk of recurrent vascular events varied substantially be-
tween patients with different clinical manifestations of 
vascular disease (Table 2), with patients with CAD having 
the lowest risks (median 14%; IQR, 10%–20%) and pa-
tients with polyvascular disease having the highest risks 
(median, 35%; IQR, 23%–54%).
external Validation of the sMart risk score in 
tnt, iDeal, sParcl, and caPrie
After recalibration in the CVD and PAD validation popu-
lations (SPARCL and CAPRIE) separately, calibration ap-
peared reasonable in all 3 external populations (Table 
VIII in the online-only Data Supplement and Figure IA in 
the online-only Data Supplement). Systematic overesti-
mation of risk was seen among patients with an esti-
mated 5-year risk >25% (Figure IB in the online-only Data 
Supplement), corresponding to an estimated 10-year 
risk >40%, and underestimation of risk was seen among 
patients with CAD with a 5-year risk <20% (10-year risk 
<35%). Gronnesby and Borgan P values were <0.01, 
0.18, and 0.44 in the CAD, CVD, and PAD populations, 
respectively. Discrimination was modest with C statis-
tics of 0.63 (95% confidence interval, 0.61–0.65) in 
patients with CAD (TNT/IDEAL), 0.62 (95% confidence 
interval, 0.59–0.65) in patients with CVD (SPARCL), 
0.66 (95% confidence interval, 0.63–0.68) in patients 
with PAD (CAPRIE), and 0.64 (95% confidence interval, 
0.63–0.65) in the pooled populations.
estimated reducible and residual 10-Year risks 
of recurrent Vascular events and Mortality
The overall median reducible risk was 5% (IQR, 2%–11%). 
This additional reducible risk was highest in patients with 
AAA (16%; IQR, 9%–22%) and lowest in patients with CAD 
(3%; IQR, 1%–6%). Figure 2 is an illustration of the reduc-
ible risk per risk factor stratified by location of vascular 
disease. After optimal control of risk factors as advocat-
ed in guidelines, the estimated residual 10-year risk of 
recurrent vascular events varied substantially (Figure 3), 
with about half of the patients (47%) at <10% risk and 
9% at >30% risk despite guideline-recommended control 
of risk factors. This residual risk also varied between 
patients with different types of vascular disease, with 
patients with polyvascular disease having the highest es-
timated residual risk (median, 22%; IQR, 14%–36%) and 
patients with PAD having the lowest estimated residual 
risk (median, 8%; IQR, 5%–12%), although marked varia-
tion in risk was still observed (Figure 3).
Sensitivity analyses leaving out the physical activity 
target showed similar results for the estimates of reduc-
ible and residual risks. Sensitivity analyses of patients 
enrolled in the period of 2008 to 2013 showed simi-
lar results for the distribution in estimated 10-year risk

and the estimated residual risk. On average, risk factor 
control was better in patients more recently enrolled be-
tween 2008 and 2013 compared with the total popula-
tion, and as a consequence, the amount of reducible 
risk was lower in these patients, with a median of 3% 
(IQR, 1%–7%) compared with 5% (IQR, 2%–11%) in the 
total study population. This lower reducible risk in more 
recently treated patients was seen across all subgroups 
of patients with vascular disease and was still highest 
in patients with AAA (median, 8%; IQR, 4%–16%) and 
lowest in patients with CAD (2%; IQR, 1%–5%). Repeat-
ing the analyses using only patients with complete data 
(n=6219 [90% of the SMART population]) showed very 
similar results.
DiscussiOn
We found that patients with prevalent vascular disease 
display a substantial variation in estimated 10-year risk 
of recurrent vascular events. In fact, 18% of the patients 
are at relatively low 10-year risk (<10%), whereas 22% 
had an estimated risk of >30%. If all guideline-recom-
mended targets were reached, the 10-year risk of re-
current vascular events could be reduced to <10% for

about half of the patients with vascular disease. Howev-
er, very large variation in the residual 10-year risk would 
still remain, with 20% of patients at >20% risk and 9% at 
even >30% risk of a recurrent vascular event.
Vascular event rates have declined over the last de-
cades.5 The present study demonstrates that simply 
considering all patients with vascular disease to be at 
(very) high risk for further vascular events does not re-
flect actual risk in these patients. Very few studies have 
reported the distribution of risk in patients with a his-
tory of vascular disease,30 although from the primary 
prevention setting, we know that vascular prognosis var-
ies greatly between patients.3,4 The observed variation 
in risk is a consequence of differences in the prevalence 
and levels of both modifiable and nonmodifiable risk fac-
tors (Table 1).31 This 10-year risk could be reduced with 
a median reducible risk of 5% if guideline-recommended 
targets were attained. The notion that “we can do better” 
is supported by our observation that better risk factor 
control between 2008 and 2013 resulted in fewer pos-
sibilities for improvement, with a 10-year reducible risk 
of 3% in patients enrolled in this period. If all risk factors 
were at target, the risk of recurrent vascular events could 
be relatively low (10-year risk <10%) for about half of the 
patients with vascular disease. However there would still 
be substantial variation, with many patients at >20% and 
even >30% residual 10-year risk (Figure 3). Residual risk 
in patients with vascular disease is explained by modifi-
able risk factors such as on-treatment cholesterol lev-
els,32,33 potentially modifiable risk factors such as inflam-
mation,6,33 and nonmodifiable factors, including age and 
genetic predisposition.
Our findings may have several implications for clinical 
practice and future cardiovascular research. The large 
heterogeneity in estimated 10-year risk demonstrates 
that a single secondary prevention strategy for all pa-
tients with vascular disease may no longer be appropri-
ate. Risk stratification may help to identify patients for 
intensive follow-up and to emphasize the importance of 
therapy adherence for reaching risk factor targets. Al-

are difficult to attain and how clinicians and patients can 
be best assisted to follow guideline recommendations. 
Nevertheless, even with the currently available options 
for risk reduction as advocated in secondary prevention 
guidelines, a clear unmet need in patients with vascular 
disease remains, with many patients at >20% and even 
>30% 10-year risk for recurrent events.36 Several novel 
therapeutic options for cardiovascular prevention have 
the potential to address this unmet medical need and 
are currently under investigation in large outcome trials. 
For example, further lowering targets for traditional risk 
factors such as LDL cholesterol or using novel thera-
peutic targets such as inflammation may be considered. 
It is clear that more research is needed to assess the 
actual benefit of novel therapies for individual patients 
with vascular disease.37,38 The observed variation in risk

supports risk stratification as a tool to select patients 
for cardiovascular trials. Because high-risk patients may 
yield the largest benefit in terms of lower numbers need-
ed to treat with novel treatments, a risk-based selection 
of patients for cardiovascular trials may improve trial fo-
cus and efficiency.36
The SMART risk score is a tool that may be used for 
these purposes. Its external validation in 3 separate pop-
ulations shows reasonable performance. Although sys-
tematic overestimation of risk was seen among those 
with 10-year risk >40%, calibration was fairly good with-
in the range of 0% to 40% estimated 10-year risk, which 
is more relevant for daily clinical practice and represents 
the majority of patients seen. The limited discriminatory 
ability is partly inherent to the population of interest. Se-
lecting patients with a certain disease (in this case, vas-
cular disease) results in a relatively homogeneous popu-
lation in which it is more difficult to discriminate risk, 
especially in the specific subgroups of CAD, CVD, and 
PAD. In addition, we evaluated the performance in trial 
populations that are, because of strict inclusion and ex-
clusion criteria, generally more homogeneous compared 
with observational studies (Table I in the online-only Data 
Supplement). Therefore, discrimination is likely to be bet-
ter in a more heterogeneous population, which is likely 
to be the case in clinical practice. Further optimization 
of the SMART risk score might improve risk estimation 
in these patients, for example, by adding less traditional 
but well-known predictors such as atrial fibrillation.30 
However, for the present population, the risk predictions 
are known to be accurate because the SMART risk score 
was developed in these patients.
Strengths of this study include the dynamic cohort de-
sign, representing clinical practice by including patients 
with different manifestations of vascular disease with 
long follow-up. A limitation is that, for the estimation of 
residual risk, the relative effects for the lifestyle targets 
smoking and physical activity were obtained from obser-
vational studies20,39 and thus are vulnerable to bias, espe-
cially confounding bias. Because the applied effects were 
adjusted for confounders and because limited heteroge-
neity in the relative effects was observed across several 
subgroups, we consider these estimates valid for our 
study population. Another limitation is that we performed 
external validation in trial populations with putative in-
clusion and exclusion criteria, relatively short follow-up, 
and limited availability of some of the predictors of the 
SMART risk score. Finally, the study population is from 
1 academic center in the Netherlands, which may limit 
the generalizability of our findings. Because the partici-
pants originated from daily clinical practice with limited 
inclusion or exclusion criteria, we consider our findings 
generalizable to other populations with vascular disease. 
As a result of geographic variation in underlying event 
rates and risk factor prevalence, the median risks may 
vary between countries.40 However, this does not affect 
the generalizability of our findings that there is substantial 
variation in both estimated and residual 10-year risk in 
patients with clinically manifest vascular disease.
cOnclusiOns
There is substantial variation in the estimated 10-year 
risk of recurrent vascular events in patients with vascular 
disease. About 18% of the patients were at relatively low 
risk (<10%) and 22% were at >30% risk. Improvements 
in reaching risk factors targets could reduce the 10-year 
risk to <10% in half of the patients with vascular disease; 
however, the residual risk still shows marked variation up 
to >30% 10-year risk. These findings demonstrate that 
considering all patients with vascular disease to be at 
equally high risk of a new vascular event is no longer 
valid. Instead, risk stratification can be used to further 
optimize cardiovascular disease prevention for patients 
with vascular disease.
