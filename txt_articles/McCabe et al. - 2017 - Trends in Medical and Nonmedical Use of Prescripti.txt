abstract
OBJECTIVES: Most US studies of national trends in medical and nonmedical use of prescription 
opioids have focused on adults. Given the limited understanding in these trends among 
adolescents, we examine national trends in the medical and nonmedical use of prescription 
opioids among high school seniors between 1976 and 2015.
METHODS: The data used for the study come from the Monitoring the Future study of 
adolescents. Forty cohorts of nationally representative samples of high school seniors 
(modal age 18) were used to examine self-reported medical and nonmedical use of 
prescription opioids.
RESULTS: Lifetime prevalence of medical use of prescription opioids peaked in both 1989 
and 2002 and remained stable until a recent decline from 2013 through 2015. Lifetime 
nonmedical use of prescription opioids was less prevalent and highly correlated with 
medical use of prescription opioids over this 40-year period. Adolescents who reported 
both medical and nonmedical use of prescription opioids were more likely to indicate 
medical use of prescription opioids before initiating nonmedical use.
CONCLUSIONS: Prescription opioid exposure is common among US adolescents. Long-
term trends indicate that one-fourth of high school seniors self-reported medical or 
nonmedical use of prescription opioids. Medical and nonmedical use of prescription 
opioids has declined recently and remained highly correlated over the past 4 decades. 
Sociodemographic differences and risky patterns involving medical and nonmedical use 
of prescription opioids should be taken into consideration in clinical practice to improve 
opioid analgesic prescribing and reduce adverse consequences associated with prescription 
opioid use among adolescents.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Opioid analgesic 
prescribing has increased in the United States 
over the past 4 decades. To date, studies examining 
national trends in medical and nonmedical use of 
prescription opioids have focused primarily on adults 
and relied on separate data sources.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Medical use of prescription 
opioids was highly correlated with nonmedical use 
over the past 4 decades, especially among male 
adolescents. Adolescents reporting both medical and 
nonmedical use of prescription opioids were more 
likely to initiate medical before nonmedical use.

The United States consumes the 
majority of the world’s prescription 
opioid supply, and multiple studies 
have reported substantial increases 
in the prescribing of opioid 
analgesics. 
1 
 
 
 
– 
7 One consequence of 
an increase in the prescribing of 
opioids is a concomitant increase in 
opioid-related consequences such 
as nonmedical use, prescription 
opioid use disorders, emergency 
department admissions, and 
overdose deaths due to greater 
availability of these medications. 
1, 
 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
–

These associations suggest that 
the trends in nonmedical use of 
prescription opioids (NUPO) should 
be considered in the larger context of 
medical availability of prescription 
opioids.
To date, studies examining national 
trends in medical use of prescription 
opioids and NUPO have focused 
primarily on adults and relied on 
separate data sources. 
1, 
 
3 
 
– 
7 
Four studies have examined the 
association between medical use 
of prescription opioids and NUPO 
among adolescents and found 
that the majority of medical users 
reported no history of NUPO. 
10, 
 
13 
–15 
In contrast, most adolescents who 
report NUPO have a history of 
medical use of prescription 
opioids. 
10, 
 
13 
– 
15 Despite the 
aforementioned studies aimed 
at determining the associations 
between medical use of prescription 
opioids and NUPO, there is a paucity 
of research using repeated national 
samples that assesses the long-term 
trends, correlations, and patterns of 
medical use of prescription opioids 
and NUPO among adolescents.16 
 
– 
19 
Furthermore, previous studies have 
examined race and sex differences in 
medical use of prescription opioids 
and generally found that female and 
white adolescents were more likely 
to be prescribed opioid analgesics 
than male and black adolescents, 
respectively. 
13, 
14, 
 
20, 
 
21 Unfortunately, 
these studies have often been limited 
by their regional focus at single 
points in time.
Given these gaps in knowledge, 
more national studies are needed to 
determine whether there are long-
term associations between changes 
in medical use of prescription opioids 
and NUPO among adolescents. 
Empirically demonstrating a long-
term relationship between medical 
use and NUPO will be particularly 
helpful in refining recommendations 
for safely prescribing opioid 
medications among adolescents 
while reducing NUPO. Because of the 
lack of available data on the long-
term trends among adolescents, the 
primary aim of this study was to 
assess the trends and correlations 
in the prevalence of medical use 
of prescription opioids and NUPO 
among US high school seniors from 
1976 to 2015.
METHODS
The Monitoring the Future (MTF) 
study annually surveys a cross-
sectional, nationally representative 
sample of US high school seniors 
attending ~135 public and private 
schools, via self-administered 
paper-and-pencil questionnaires in 
classrooms. This study considered 
samples of high school seniors from 
40 independent cohorts (senior years 
1976–2015), each recruited through 
a multistage random-sampling 
design. The response rates ranged 
from 77% to 86% between 1976 and 
2015. Because so many questions are 
included in the MTF study, much of 
the questionnaire content is divided 
into 6 different forms, which are 
randomly distributed. This approach 
results in 6 identical subsamples. 
The measures most relevant for this 
study were asked on form 1, so this 
study focuses on the cross-sectional 
subsamples receiving form 1 in each 
of the 40 cohorts. Details about the 
MTF study design and methods 
are available elsewhere. 
22, 
 
23 The 
University of Michigan Institutional 
Review Board provided approval for 
this study.
Each of the 40 cohorts was an 
independent, cross-sectional, 
nationally representative sample 
of US high school seniors. The 
demographic characteristics of the 
population represented by these 
cohorts varied over time. MTF 
sampling weights were applied in all 
analyses to ensure that each sample 
was representative of all high school 
seniors in each cohort in terms of sex 
and race and ethnicity. The modal age 
in each cohort was 18 years old. The 
sample size per cohort ranged from 
2181 to 3791.
Measures
The MTF study assesses a wide 
range of behaviors, attitudes, and 
values. 
22, 
 
23 We selected specific 
measures for analysis in the current 
study, including demographic 
characteristics (ie, sex and race) and 
standard measures of substance use 
behaviors.
We assessed medical use of 
prescription opioids by asking 
whether respondents had ever taken 
prescription opioids because a doctor 
told them to use the medication. 
Respondents were informed that 
prescription opioids are prescribed 
by doctors and sold in drugstores and 
are not supposed to be sold without a 
prescription. These included Vicodin, 
OxyContin, Percodan, Percocet, 
Demerol, Ultram, methadone, 
morphine, opium, and codeine. The 
response options included 1, “No;" 2, 
"Yes, but I had already tried them on 
my own;" and 3, "Yes, and it was the 
first time I took any.” The range of 
missing data was 6.0% to 12.0% for 
medical use of prescription opioids.
We assessed NUPO by asking on 
how many occasions (if any) in 
their lifetime the adolescent used 
prescription opioids on their own, 
that is, “without a doctor telling you 
to take them.” The response options 
ranged from 1, “no occasions, 
” to

7, “≥40 occasions.” The range of 
missing data was 6.0% to 12.4% 
for NUPO. Although the wording 
of the medical and nonmedical use 
questions remained identical across 
all 40 cohorts, the list of examples 
of prescription opioids was updated 
over time. In 2002, Talwin, laudanum, 
and paregoric had negligible rates of 
use by 2001 and were replaced with 
Vicodin, OxyContin, and Percocet, 
which probably contributed to an 
increase in medical and nonmedical 
use in 2002. Changes in wording 
in long-term studies represent a 
challenge to tracking cross-sectional 
behavioral trends related to 
prescription opioids over time. It is 
noteworthy that identical wording 
changes were made to both medical 
and nonmedical use questions in 
the MTF study at the same time; in 
addition, similar updates were made 
to prescription opioid questions in 
other national studies.
Statistical Analysis
For each of the 40 cohorts, we first 
used the cohort-specific sampling 
weights to estimate the prevalence of 
lifetime medical use of prescription 
opioids and the prevalence of lifetime 
NUPO, both overall and for male 
and female adolescents separately. 
We also estimated the prevalence 
of medical use and NUPO for white 
and black adolescents. We used 
a method outlined previously to 
compute linearized estimates of 
standard errors for the weighted 
estimates reflecting the complex MTF 
sampling features. 
24 Next, for each 
cohort, we estimated the prevalence 
of the following 4 mutually exclusive 
subgroups: lifetime medical use of 
prescription opioids only, medical 
use of prescription opioids before 
NUPO, NUPO before medical use 
of prescription opioids, and NUPO 
only. We estimated the prevalence of 
these subgroups overall as well as for 
male and female adolescents in each 
cohort. Estimated prevalence for 
male and female adolescents within 
a given year was compared via the 
methods for comparing descriptive 
parameters in 2 subgroups defined in 
previous work. 
25
Finally, given the weighted 
prevalence estimates and linearized 
standard errors for each of the 40 
cohorts, we assessed the correlation 
of the estimated prevalence for 
medical use of prescription opioids 
and NUPO across the 40 cohorts by 
using 3 different methods. First, we 
estimated a simple unweighted linear 
regression coefficient predicting 
estimated NUPO prevalence as a 
function of estimated medical use 
prevalence. Next, we fit the same 
model by using variance-weighted 
least squares and using the estimated 
SE of the nonmedical use prevalence 
to determine the weights. Finally, 
we computed a Pearson correlation 
coefficient describing the strength 
of the linear association between 
the 2 sets of prevalence estimates 
across the 40 cohorts. These 3 tests 
of association, designed to gauge 
the robustness of the associations, 
were repeated for subpopulations 
based on sex and race. All analyses 
were performed in Stata version 14.1 
(Stata Corp, College Station, TX).
RESULTS
Lifetime medical use of prescription 
opioids was more prevalent than 
lifetime NUPO among high school 
seniors over the 1976 to 2015 
time period ( 
Fig 1). The estimated 
lifetime prevalence of medical use of 
prescription opioids increased from 
16.0% (SE = 0.9) in 1976 to a peak of 
20.4% (SE = 1.1) in 1989, gradually 
declined to a low of 13.2% (SE = 1.0) 
in 1997, held stable until a rapid 
increase to 20.0% (SE = 1.3) in 2002 
(partially influenced by a change in 
question wording; see the Measures 
section), and then remained stable 
until a decline after 2013. The 
lifetime NUPO was correlated with 
medical use of prescription opioids 
over time, regardless of the test 
of association used; we report 
the Pearson correlation here (r = 
0.50, P < .01). The estimated linear 
regression coefficients for medical 
use prevalence as a predictor of 
NUPO prevalence were 0.552 
(ordinary least squares, P < .01) 
and 0.450 (variance-weighted least 
squares, P < .001).
The lifetime medical use of 
prescription opioids tended to 
be more prevalent among female 
adolescents relative to male 
adolescents ( 
Fig 2). In contrast, the 
prevalence of NUPO differed less by 
sex. The Pearson correlation between 
medical use of prescription opioids 
and NUPO was much stronger for 
male (r = 0.67, P < .001) than female 
adolescents (r = 0.34, P < .05).
The prevalence of medical use of 
prescription opioids was consistently 
higher among white adolescents 
relative to black adolescents ( 
Fig 3). 
Similarly, NUPO was more prevalent 
among white adolescents as 
compared with black adolescents. 
The Pearson correlation between 
medical use of prescription opioids 
and NUPO was robust for African 
American (r = 0.79, P < .001) and 
white adolescents (r = 0.65, P < .001).
Next, we examined the long-term 
trends in patterns of lifetime medical 
and nonmedical use history for 
prescription opioids among high 
school seniors ( 
Fig 4). We found 
that the most prevalent pattern of 
exposure to prescription opioids was 
medical use only (without a history 
of NUPO) over the course of the study 
period, ranging from a low of 8.5% 
(SE = 0.9) in 2000 to a high of 14.4% 
(SE = 0.8) in 1989. Among those who 
report a history of both medical use 
of prescription opioids and NUPO, the 
most prevalent pattern was generally 
medical use before initiating NUPO, 
ranging from a low of 2.6% (SE = 0.2) 
in 1979 to a high of 5.4% (SE = 0.6) in 
1990, and the least prevalent pattern 
tended to be NUPO before initiating 
medical use of prescription opioids. 
Finally, the prevalence of NUPO 
3

MCCABE et al 
only has remained similar to that of 
medical use before initiating NUPO 
over the past decade.
Additional analyses indicated that 
medical use only was more prevalent 
among female than male adolescents 
in 19 out of 40 years (P < .05); see 
Supplemental Fig 5. In contrast, 
NUPO only was more prevalent 
(P < .05) among male than female 
adolescents in 6 of the 40 years (see 
Supplemental Fig 6). There were 
fewer sex differences in NUPO before 
initiating medical use of prescription 
opioids, with male adolescents 
reporting higher prevalence rates 
than female adolescents in 4 of the 
40 years (P < .05); see Supplemental 
Fig 5. Finally, there were the fewest 
sex differences in medical use of 
prescription opioids before engaging 
in NUPO, with female adolescents 
reporting higher prevalence rates 
than male adolescents in 2 of the 
40 years (P < .05), see Supplemental 
Fig 6.
DISCUSSION
We found that the medical use of 
prescription opioids was highly 
correlated with NUPO among high 
school seniors between 1976 and 
2015. The prevalence of lifetime 
medical use or NUPO ranged from 
16.5% to 24.1% over the past 4 
decades. The recent declines in 
medical use of prescription opioids 
and NUPO from 2013 through 2015 
found in the current study coincide 
with similar recent declines in US 
opioid analgesic prescribing. 
7, 
 
26 
Although medical use of prescription 
opioids without any history of NUPO 
was the most prevalent exposure 
to prescription opioids between 
1976 and 2015, we found that the 
majority of adolescents indicating 
NUPO also had a history of medical 
use of prescription opioids. Among 
adolescents who report both medical 
use of prescription opioids and 
NUPO, medical use before initiating 
NUPO tended to be most prevalent,

and this pattern may be driven by the 
one-third of adolescents who report 
NUPO involving leftover opioid 
medications from their own previous 
prescriptions. 
22, 
 
27, 
28
The medical use of prescription 
opioids was generally more prevalent 
among female adolescents, whereas 
NUPO differed little by sex. Although 
sex differences in medical use of 
prescription opioids have been 
documented, 
 
13, 
 
14, 
 
21, 
 
29 the current 
study extended previous research 
by examining long-term trends. The 
medical use of prescription opioids 
was found to be highly correlated 
with NUPO across the 40 cross-
sectional samples among high school 
seniors, consistent with previous 
findings among adults.1, 
 
3 
 
 
–7 Notably, 
we found that the correlation was 
much stronger for male than female 
adolescents.
Based on past research, there 
are several possible reasons why 
medical use of prescription opioids 
is more highly correlated with 
NUPO among male adolescents than 
female adolescents. First, NUPO is 
directly related to the availability 
of prescription opioids, and several 
previous studies have shown 
sex differences in the diversion 
associated with NUPO among 
adolescents. 
30 
 
– 
33 For instance, male 
nonmedical users are more likely 
to obtain prescription opioids 
from their peers, whereas female 
nonmedical users are more likely 
to obtain prescription opioids from 
family members.31, 
 
32 The higher rate 
of peer-to-peer diversion among 
male adolescents may increase 
the risk of NUPO when medical 
availability increases.
Second, male nonmedical users 
are more likely to use prescription 
opioids nonmedically to get high, 
whereas female nonmedical users 
are more likely to use for physical 
pain relief. 
20, 
 
32, 
 
34 The higher rate 
of non–pain relief motives among 
male adolescents could partially 
account for the stronger correlation 
between medical use of prescription 
opioids and NUPO. The findings of 
the current study reinforce the need

for prevention and intervention 
efforts to reduce NUPO to take into 
account the reasons and diversion 
sources associated with NUPO among 
adolescents, especially among male 
adolescents.
Medical use of prescription opioids 
and NUPO were more prevalent 
among white adolescents than 
among black adolescents. There are 
probably several reasons for these 
findings. First, previous work has 
documented health disparities for 
receiving prescription opioids among 
racial minority patients. 
35 
– 
37 For 
example, in a study that considered 
a sample of pharmacies in Michigan 
located in low-income zip codes, 
pharmacies in predominantly white 
zip codes (defined as ≥70% white 
residents) had odds of carrying 
sufficient opioid analgesics that were 
54 times higher than the odds for 
pharmacies in predominantly racial 
minority zip codes (defined as ≥70% 
racial minority residents). 
35
Second, past studies have shown 
racial differences in the motives and 
diversion sources associated with 
NUPO. 
31, 
 
33, 
 
38 For instance, black 
adolescents were more likely than 
white adolescents to be motivated 
solely by pain relief. 
36 Thus, the 
lower prevalence of medical use 
of prescription opioids and NUPO 
among black relative to white 
adolescents could result from a lack 
of adequate treatment, insufficient 
availability, overprescribing 
among white populations, or 
underprescribing among nonwhite 
populations.
The current study indicates 
previous peaks in the medical 
use of prescription opioids and 
NUPO that preceded the current 
opioid crisis. There are several 
possible explanations for these 
different trends. Although NUPO for 
recreational reasons (eg, to get high) 
was most prevalent in the late 1970s 
and early 2000s, NUPO to relieve 
pain was least prevalent during these 
2 time periods, whereas NUPO to 
reduce negative affect (eg, relieve 
tension) rose to its highest level in the 
early 2000s. 
34 The abuse potential 
of prescription opioids has changed 
over time, and this potential may play 
a role in the current opioid epidemic 
that deserves more attention.
The implications for clinical 
practice given these data and 
the current opioid epidemic are 
multiple: (1) use of prescription 
drug monitoring programs to assist 
in identifying misuse as routine 
practice; (2) clinical decision-
making with adolescents and 
parents or guardians about risks 
and benefits of pain management 
with and without prescription 
opioids, including the importance 
of proper storage, monitoring, and 
disposal of prescription opioids; 
(3) screening for NUPO, substance 
use disorders, and other mental 
health disorders; (4) prescribing

response options to the race question between early cohort years (1976–1982) and more recent cohort years (1983–2015), we examined race trends 
starting in 1983 to have consistent race categories over time. The dotted line refl
 ects the fact that the list of examples of prescription opioids was updated 
in 2002, which probably contributed to an increase in medical and nonmedical use of prescription opioids in 2002 (see the Measures section for details 
of the updates).

the lowest effective dosage and the 
minimum quantity with concomitant 
use of acetaminophen or ibuprofen 
to decrease opioid requirement 
when not contraindicated; and (5) 
avoiding concurrent prescription of 
sedatives per the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention best practice 
recommendations. 
39
The current study has some 
limitations that must be taken 
into account for considering the 
implications of the findings. First, 
the MTF study is a long self-report 
survey and is subject to recall bias 
and respondent burden. Second, 
the MTF study did not assess age of 
onset, dose, duration, pain condition, 
or efficacy related to medical use of 
prescription opioids. Third, the MTF 
study does not assess some potential 
confounding variables in 12th grade, 
such as opioid use disorders and 
family mental health history. Fourth, 
students who dropped out of school 
or were absent on the day of data 
collection did not participate in the 
study, and these students are more 
likely to report substance use. 
22 
Thus, students who experienced 
the most serious consequences 
associated with NUPO are probably 
underrepresented in the sample, 
resulting in underestimates and a 
need for comparable research among 
adolescents not enrolled in school. 
Finally, the results were based on 40 
independent cross-sectional surveys, 
which limited the ability to draw 
conclusions about causation. More 
prospective research is needed to 
examine the longitudinal associations 
between medical use of prescription 
opioids, NUPO, and opioid use 
disorders over the life span.
CONCLUSIONS
This study examined long-term 
trends in the relationships between 
the medical use of prescription 
opioids and NUPO in a large 
multicohort national study over the

past 4 decades. The findings provide 
compelling evidence that medical use 
of prescription opioids and NUPO are 
highly correlated, especially among 
male adolescents. The recent declines 
in medical use of prescription 
opioids and NUPO from 2013 
through 2015 found in the current 
study provide additional evidence 
for the continuation of previous 
declines reported in opioid analgesic
