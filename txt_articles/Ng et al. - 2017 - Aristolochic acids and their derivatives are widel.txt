Many traditional pharmacopeias include Aristolochia and related plants, which contain nephrotoxins and mutagens
in the form of aristolochic acids and similar compounds (collectively, AA). AA is implicated in multiple cancer types,
sometimes with very high mutational burdens, especially in upper tract urothelial cancers (UTUCs). AA-associated
kidney failure and UTUCs are prevalent in Taiwan, but AA’s role in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) there remains
unexplored. Therefore, we sequenced the whole exomes of 98 HCCs from two hospitals in Taiwan and found that
78% showed the distinctive mutational signature of AA exposure, accounting for most of the nonsilent mutations in
known cancer driver genes. We then searched for the AA signature in 1400 HCCs from diverse geographic regions.
Consistent with exposure through known herbal medicines, 47% of Chinese HCCs showed the signature, albeit with
lower mutation loads than in Taiwan. In addition, 29% of HCCs from Southeast Asia showed the signature. The AA
signature was also detected in 13 and 2.7% of HCCs from Korea and Japan as well as in 4.8 and 1.7% of HCCs from
North America and Europe, respectively, excluding one U.S. hospital where 22% of 87 “Asian” HCCs had the signa-
ture. Thus, AA exposure is geographically widespread. Asia, especially Taiwan, appears to be much more extensively
affected, which is consistent with other evidence of patterns of AA exposure. We propose that additional measures
aimed at primary prevention through avoidance of AA exposure and investigation of possible approaches to
secondary prevention are warranted.
INTRODUCTION
Mutational signature analysis provides a molecular epidemiological tool
for detecting environmental exposures that cause cancers (1–5). This
has important implications for public health by providing evidence to
substantiate causal links between exposures and tumors, providing
opportunities for primary and secondary prevention. Mutational sig-
nature analysis may also affect clinical oncology in situations where
identifiable mutagenic exposures suggest specific cancer risks or pre-
ferred treatments.
Mutational signature analysis has been particularly helpful in
illuminating the epidemiology of tumors associated with aristolochic
acids and their derivatives (collectively, AA). Among these com-
pounds, the in vitro toxicity and mutagenicity of aristolochic acids
and aristolactams have been most intensively studied (6–8). AAs in-
clude potent mutagens and nephrotoxins present in plants in the genera
Aristolochia and Asarum, as well as related plants (6, 7). Many of these
plants are used as herbal medicines (9–18). AA mutagenesis is thought
to stem from the formation of bulky adducts on purines (19–21). For
reasons that are imperfectly understood, but possibly related to better
repair of AA-guanine adducts, more accurate translesion synthesis
across AA-guanine adducts, or both, AA induces adenine-to-thymine
(A>T) mutations almost exclusively (9, 20, 22–24).
In the early 1990s, inadvertent treatment with AA-containing herbs
at a Belgian weight loss clinic caused kidney failure in ~100 women (25),
many of whom later developed bladder and upper tract urothelial
carcinomas (UTUCs) (9). Subsequently, additional reports of kidney
failure and urothelial cancers due to AA poisoning appeared, and it
emerged that AA was also responsible for Balkan endemic nephropathy
(9). Taiwan also emerged as a hot spot for AA exposure based on pre-
scription records and high rates of kidney failure and UTUCs, which are
likely to be partly due to AA exposure (26–30). More recently, muta-
tional signature analysis and other lines of evidence have suggested that
AA mutagenesis may be widespread in terms of both geography and
types of cancer affected (10). In particular, after we and others described
a distinctive mutational signature of AA exposure in the genomes of
UTUCs from Taiwan (29, 30), this signature was also found in bladder
carcinomas (BCs) from Taiwan and other regions (31), renal cell car-
cinomas(RCCs)fromTaiwanandtheBalkans (32–34),intrahepatic bile
duct carcinomas from China (35), bile duct carcinomas from Singapore
(36), and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) from China, Vietnam, and
other Southeast Asian countries (29, 37–39).
Inference of high rates of AA exposure in Taiwan is based on the
following evidence: (i) prescription records indicating about one-third
of the population exposed to AA (28), (ii) high rates of UTUCs and
co-association of kidney failure and UTUCs (40, 41), (iii) presence of
AA-DNA adducts associated with UTUCs and RCCs (26, 34), and
(iv) presence of the AA mutational signature in UTUCs, BCs, and

 RCCs from Taiwan (29–31, 34). However, despite the high amount of
AA exposure in Taiwan and reports of the AA mutational signature in
HCCs from China and other areas, AA exposure in Taiwan HCCs re-
mains unexplored.
RESULTS
Overview of somatic changes in 98 HCCs from Taiwan
To investigate the possible presence of the AA mutational signature in
HCCs from Taiwan, we sequenced the exomes of 98 HCCs and
matched nonmalignant tissues from two hospitals (table S1). Tumor
tissue was obtained from nonconsecutive patients, and inclusion in this
study was solely based on the availability of adequate DNA. Tumors
were not selected based on suspicion of AA exposure.
We sequenced whole exomes, with a mean of 95% targeted tumor
bases with ≥30× coverage (table S2). We detected a total of 26,805
somatic single-base substitution (SBS) mutations across the HCCs
(median, 167 SBS per tumor; interquartile range, 103 to 316), with an
estimated false discovery rate (FDR) of 1.9% (tables S3 and S4). We
detected a total of 648 short insertions or deletions (indels; median,
6 indels per tumor; interquartile range, 3 to 9), with an estimated FDR
of 3.2% (tables S3 and S5).
In total, 10,174 genes harbored nonsilent SBS mutations (table S4).
Driver analysis with MutSigCV (42) and 20/20+ (43) identified 16
significantly mutated genes (tables S6 to S8). The most commonly
mutated genes—TP53, CTNNB1, ALB, and AXIN1—were also the
most commonly mutated in the recent TCGA (The Cancer Genome
Atlas) report (37), but the proportions of tumors with mutations in
these genes were higher in the Taiwan HCCs (table S6). Among these
genes, it has been proposed that ALB inactivation may promote cancer
development by “diverting energy into cancer-relevant metabolic
pathways” (37, 44). An additional gene identified by this analysis
was IRF2, which was previously reported to act as a tumor suppressor
in HCC (45). Of the other genes, two have not been identified as likely
drivers in previous genome- or exome-wide resequencing of HCCs,
and other evidence of their roles in cancer is absent or very limited,
suggesting a lack of functional roles in HCC (table S6). Previously ob-
served genomically amplified oncogenes and deleted tumor suppres-
sors were also amplified or deleted in the Taiwan HCCs(fig. S1).These
genes included the amplified oncogene CCND1 and the deleted tumor
suppressor RB1 (37, 39, 46–49).
High rates of the AA mutational signature in Taiwan HCCs
The mutational spectra of most of the HCCs from Taiwan showed
marked evidence of AA exposure, in the form of high proportions of
A:T>T:A mutations in the trinucleotide contexts characteristic of AA-
exposed tumors and cell lines (Fig. 1, A to D, and fig. S2) (29–31), al-
though some HCCs did not show this evidence (Fig. 1E and fig. S2). The
trinucleotide contexts characteristic of AA exposure included a prom-
inent peak at 5′-CTG-3′ (5′-CAG-3′ on the complementary strand).
There was also a notable excess of A>T mutations on the nontran-
scribed strands of genes, which is characteristic of AA-induced muta-
tionsinothertumortypesandincelllines(29–35).Principalcomponents
analysis clustered the majority of the Taiwan HCCs away from other
HCCs and with previously reported AA-associated UTUCs (29, 30)
and BCs (31) and with AA-exposed cell lines (Fig. 1F) (29).
To systematically assess the extent of AA exposure across the
98 HCCs, we developed the mSigAct (mutational signature activity)
software. mSigAct provides a signature presence test to infer whether
observedmutationspectraarebetterexplainedwithacontributionfrom
the AA mutational signature [Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in
Cancer (COSMIC) signature 22] than without. We developed mSigAct
because, to our knowledge, current approaches, most of which are based
on nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), do not support statistical
inference of the presence or absence of a signature (3, 4, 50, 51). Briefly,
the mSigAct test starts by generating optimal coefficients for recon-
struction of the observed spectrum using the mutational signatures
previously detected in HCCs. The test first does this without the AA
signature (null hypothesis) and then with the AA signature (al-
ternative hypothesis). The test then carries out a standard likelihood
ratio test on these two hypotheses. Supplementary Materials and
Methods and codes S1 and S2 provide details on the test, its evaluation
on synthetic data, and the code. mSigAct revealed strong evidence of
AAexposure in 76of the 98HCCs(78%withFDR<0.05;Fig. 2, Table 1,
and table S9). Among tumors with the AA signature, there was a
median of 2.26 AA signature mutations/Mb (mean, 4.94 AA signature
mutations/Mb).
As a further check on the mSigAct signature presence test, we also
analyzed the 98 Taiwan HCCs with the NMF procedure in (3, 4) (code
S1). The signature extracted by NMF had a Pearson correlation co-
efficient of 0.997 and a cosine similarity of 0.997 with the AA signature
(COSMIC signature 22; fig. S3 and table S10). We also used NMF to
detect the presence or absence of the AA signature and compared the
results for this to those from the mSigAct signature presence test. The
two procedures were concordant for 90 tumors (code S1). NMF iden-
tified eight putatively AA-exposed HCCs that mSigAct did not iden-
tify (T18, T41, T50, T53, T57, T61, T68, and T92; fig. S2). Thus, the
mSigAct signature presence test was more conservative; the tumors
identified by NMF but not mSigAct had very low numbers of A>T
mutations (all but one ≤15) in backgrounds of relatively high num-
bers of other mutations, making it difficult to be confident of AA ex-
posure(codeS1).Wewouldproposethatthisisthedesiredcharacteristic,
that is, it is preferable to err on the side of undercalling rather than over-
calling the presence of the AA signature. Furthermore, testing on syn-
thetic data also indicated that the mSigAct signature presence test had
better sensitivity and specificity (Supplementary Materials and Methods
and code S2).
We examined associations between the extent of exposure to the
AA signature and multiple clinical and epidemiological variables,
namely, hospital, cirrhosis status, hepatitis B carrier status, hepatitis
C carrier status, status as carrier of either hepatitis virus, diagnosis
before or after the medicinal use of some AA-containing plants was
banned in Taiwan in 2003, gender, date of diagnosis, and age at diag-
nosis (fig. S4). Of these, without correction for multiple hypothesis
testing, AA exposure differed significantly by gender and age at diag-
nosis. There was a weak association of increased AA exposure with age
(Spearman’s rho = 0.28, P = 0.008). In addition, AA mutation num-
bers were higher in females than in males (median, 176 versus 55 AA
signature mutations per HCC; P = 0.015 by two-sided Wilcoxon rank
sum test). After considering multiple hypothesis testing, the Benjamini-
Hochberg FDRs for both gender and age were 0.065. Although AA
mutation numbers were not statistically higher in women than in
men, we note other evidence of more exposure to AA-containing herbs
among women: In Taiwan before the ban, exposures were 31.6 person-
years per 1000 for women compared to 25.9 for men (28). We also note
that, because only 10 HCCs were hepatitis-negative, these data did not
offer an opportunity to investigate interactions between hepatitis and
AA exposure.

convention, mutations are shown as T>A (for example) rather than A>T, although AA mutations are physical consequences of adducts on adenines that cause A>T
mutations (9, 20, 22–24). In tumors strongly mutagenized by AA, the most prominent peak is at CTG>CAG (CAG>CTG on the complementary strand), indicated in (A),
often with additional prominent peaks at CTA>CAA and ATG>AAG. Small plots at right in (A) to (E) show transcription strand bias. Mut count, mutation count. (F) Mutation

 The AA mutational signature in HCCs from other regions
Given the high prevalence of the AA signature in Taiwan HCCs, we
examined publicly available data comprising 1400 HCCs (Table 1).
These included data from China, Japan, Korea, and several countries
in Southeast Asia (37–39, 46–48, 52, 53), as well as data from North
America and Europe (37, 49) as negative controls with likely rare AA
exposure.
We detected the AA signature in 42 of 89 HCCs (47%) from China
(Figs. 2 to 4; Table 1; fig. S5, A and B; and table S11). Among the HCCs
from earlier studies (47, 52), the mSigAct signature presence test de-
tected many more affected HCCs than we were able to identify previ-
ously (29). Overall, however, AA signature mutation burdens were
lowerinChina(median,0.29AAsignaturemutations/Mb)thaninTaiwan
(median, 2.26 AA signature mutations/Mb).
We detected the AA signature in five of nine HCCs from various
countries in Southeast Asia other than Vietnam (56%; fig. S5, C and
D) (39). Among the HCCs with the AA signature, the median mutation
burden was high(2.9AAsignature mutations/Mb). We also detectedthe
signature in 5 of 26 HCCs from Vietnam (19%) (37), with a high median
mutation burden of 3.4 AA signature mutations/Mb (fig. S5E). We also
detected the AA signature in lower proportions of the HCCs from Korea
and Japan (Table 1; Figs. 2, B and C, and 3; and fig. S5, F to H).
We analyzed TCGA data (37) from areas other than Vietnam in sev-
eral subgroups (fig. S5I). In the largest subgroup, North America, we

*We ascribe the AA signature to a proportion of each SBS as described in Materials and Methods. Because the AA signature is dominated by A:T>T:A SBS, when the activities of other signatures with these SBS
mutations are low or absent, this approximates the number of A:T>T:A SBS mutations. The weighted counts are the sums of the proportions of SBS mutations ascribed to the AA signature.
†P = 7.1 × 10−7,
for all Southeast Asia, including Vietnam.
‡Includes 10 additional TCGA HCCs: 1 Russia, 5 Brazil, 4 South Korea; 1 Brazil HCC has the AA signature.

 detected AA signature mutations in 10 of 209 HCCs (5%; Table 1 and
fig. S5J). Among HCCs from North America, the proportion with
the AA signature from “Asian” patients (2/20) was not significantly
different from non-Asian patients (8/189).
We also detected AA signature mutations in 4 of 230 HCCs from
Europe (1.7%; fig. S5K). This low proportion isconsistent withthe rarity
ofreportsofAAexposureinEuropeoutsideoftheBalkansandtheBelgian
poisoning incident in the 1990s (9, 25, 32, 33). Furthermore, the median
AA mutation burden was low (0.35 AA signature mutations/Mb), al-
though one HCC with likely DNA mismatch repair deficiency had many
more mutations.
Within the TCGA data (37), there were 89 HCCs from the Mayo
Clinic for which the “Country” field had no data, and almost all of these
(87) had “Ethnicity” listed as Asian. Among these, 19 (21%) had the AA
signature (fig. S5L). Given the high prevalence of the signature and rel-
atively high numbers of AA signature mutations in these HCCs
(median, 1.3 AA signature mutations/Mb), we speculate that some of
these patients may have traveled from Asia for treatment. In addition,
there were 30 HCCs from biobanks for which no Country information
was available. Of these, 20 were listed as Asian, and 5 (25%) of these had
the AA signature, whereas none of the non-Asian HCCs had the AA
signature (fig. S5M). Finally, one of five HCCs from Brazil with non-
Asian ethnicity (20%) showed the AA signature (fig. S5N).
The effects of the AA signature were especially prominent in Taiwan:
A higher proportion of HCCs from Taiwan showed the AA signature
than in any group other than the nine HCCs from Southeast Asia (not
including the HCCs from Vietnam; Table 1). Nevertheless, this analysis
of publicly available data showed widespread AA exposure in East and
Southeast Asia and in self-identified Asians elsewhere.
AA signature mutations in known cancer drivers
Our initial analyses with MutSigCV and 20/20+ did not reveal any
strong possibilities for previously unknown driver genes in the Taiwan
HCCs, but many genes listed in the Cancer Gene Census as known
cancer drivers (table S12) were affected by nonsilent mutations ascribed
to the AA signature (54). Across all Taiwan HCCs, the AA signature
accounted for 59% (299 of 505) of nonsilent mutations in known driver
genes (table S9). Among the Taiwan HCCs, 57 had a nonsilent AA mu-
tation in ≥1 known driver (Fig. 2C, Table 1, and table S9). Among
HCCs with the AA signature, two genes, TP53 and LRP1B, were mu-
tated frequently by both A>T and by non-A>T mutations (39 and 27
total nonsilent mutations, respectively, of which 48 and 63% were AA
signature mutations; table S13). Recurrent mutations in LRP1B could be
due to its large size (4599 amino acids; UniProt accession code Q9NZR2).
It was not identified as a driver in our MutSigCV and 20/20+ analysis,
and experimental evidence that it can function as a tumor suppressor
is limited (55, 56). Several known tumor suppressors harbored pre-
dominantly AA signature mutations (table S13). Three of these are
WNT-related tumor suppressors: AXIN1, AXIN2, and APC. Three
others—ARID1A, ARIDB, and SETD2—are involved in chromatin re-
modeling, as is the oncogene KMT2A.
Tumors with the AA signature from regions other than Taiwan also
had driver genes harboring nonsilent AA signature mutations (Table 1,
Fig. 2C, and table S13). For example, 19 of the 29 AA-affected HCCs
from Korea and all 5 of the AA-affected HCCs from Vietnam had AA
signature mutations in known driver genes.
Clonality analysis of the Taiwan HCCs that had the AA signature
suggested that AA mutations are predominantly early events, which
is consistent with exposure before carcinogenesis (fig. S6). However,
some AA signature mutations were subclonal, indicating that AA-
associated mutagenesis, and presumably AA exposure, continued during
tumor development and growth. Phylogenic analysis based on multi-
sector sequencing of HCCs from China in (38) showed that most AA
mutations were truncal (found in all regions of the tumors), but some
were subclonal, suggesting additional exposure to AA after initiation of
carcinogenesis. A reanalysis of HCCs treated in Singapore showed a
similar pattern of predominantly truncal AA signature mutations in
four of the five AA-affected tumors (table S14) (39).
Potential for immunotherapy in high-AA–burden HCCs
A large proportion of HCCs in Taiwan bore heavy burdens of AA sig-
nature mutations (Fig. 2C and Table 1) and thus may be good candidates
for immune checkpoint inhibitors (57). To investigate this possibility, we
predicted neopeptides arising from nonsynonymous mutations and then
predicted neopeptides binding to patient-specific human leukocyte

DISCUSSION
Some AA-containing herbal remedies have been officially prohibited in
Taiwan since 2003, and we looked for evidence of whether this ban re-
duced exposure. We detected no significant difference in the prevalence
of the AA signature or in the numbers of AA signature mutations in
HCCs diagnosed before and after 2003. There are a number of possible,
nonexclusive explanations. One possibility is that the decline in inci-
dence of AA-associated HCCs may simply be lagging behind reduced
AA exposure. There is precedent for this in tobacco-associated lung
cancer. In the United States, male death rates roughly doubled in the
25 years after the 1964 Surgeon General’s Report before beginning to
decline in the 1990s, presumably as a result of tobacco suppression ef-
forts that begun decades earlier (58). In this context, we also note that
AA-DNA adducts are extremely persistent (59).
Another possible explanation for unchanged prevalence of AA
signature or numbers of AA signature mutations after the 2003 ban
would be ongoing exposure to AA-containing herbal remedies. This
could arise in various ways. (i) AA-containing plants may have still been
prescribed by traditional Chinese medicine practitioners after the ban;
this was documented to be the case in the first year after the ban (28). (ii)
The nomenclature and labeling of products is confusing and error-
prone; the herbs are often bought in formulations rather than individ-
ually, and in some traditional formulations, innocuous herbs can be
replaced by herbs containing AA (12, 16, 28). (iii) Plants known to con-
tain high concentrations of aristolochic acids are easily available on
the internet, sometimes labeled correctly and sometimes incorrectly
(table S15) (12, 16). (iv) Some plants containing AA were not banned in
Taiwan. In particular, plants in the genus Asarum, collectively termed xi
xininMandarinChinese,werenotbannedandwerethemostcommonly
included plants in prescriptions surveyed in reference (28). As an exam-
ple, powdered xi xin products manufactured in Taiwan and China were
recently recalled in Singapore because they contained aristolochic acid I
(fig. S7) (60, 61). Although reports of the presence and concentrations of
aristolochic acids, aristolactams, and related compounds in xi xin are
limited, available literature suggests that the concentrations are extremely
variable andsometimeshigh(6, 12, 14, 62). An additionalarea of concern
are aristolactams, which are not as intensively studied as the aristolochic
acids but are thought to be the immediately mutagenic metabolites of
aristolochic acids that interact directly with DNA (21).
There is strong evidence that the mutational signature that we and
others have consistently observed is caused by aristolochic acids, possi-
bly in conjunction with related compounds. Nevertheless, we cannot
exclude the formal possibility that chemicals unrelated to aristolochic
acids, aristolactams, and derivatives might also induce a mutational sig-
nature resembling the AA signature. However, at present, no such
chemical is known, and many groups have independently and reprodu-
cibly detected a consistent AA mutational signature in UTUCs, BCs,
RCCs, and bile duct cancers (table S10) (3, 29–37, 49, 63). Evidence that
this signature is caused by AA and related compounds includes the mu-
tational spectra of AA-treated cell lines (29) and the signature’s associ-
ation with AA-DNA adducts (30, 34) and with AA-related nephropathy
in Taiwan and the Balkans. Furthermore, animal studies have shown
that AA adducts, and presumably AA mutagenesis, occur in the liver
(64–66).
To summarize the findings of this study, mutational signature anal-
ysis implicated AA exposure in 78% of HCCs from Taiwan. The AA
signature was much more prevalent, and the number and proportion
of mutations were notably higher in Taiwan than in most other regions.
At the same time, AA exposure was found in cohorts from all Asian
countries examined and in 22% of Asian patients treated at the Mayo
Clinic. Across Taiwan HCCs, 299 of 505 nonsilent mutations in known
driver genes were ascribed to the AA signature. Among the 76 AA-
affected Taiwan HCCs, 57 had ≥1 nonsilent AA mutation in a known
driver, and among the 133 AA-affected HCCs from elsewhere, 56 had
≥1 nonsilent AA mutation in a known driver gene, suggesting an active
role for AA in the origins of these HCCs.
The findings here indicate that exposure to aristolochic acids and
their derivatives is geographically widespread, implying substantial op-
portunities for primary and secondary prevention (Fig. 4). Medicinal
use of AA-containing plants is only lightly regulated in many jurisdic-
tions. The plants are not banned outright in China (67), and even in
Taiwan, to the best of our understanding, only specific plants, rather
than any plant and product containing AA or its derivatives, are regu-
lated. Strikingly, xi xin, the most commonly prescribed herb before
2003, is not banned (28). In the United States, sale of AA-containing
herbs is unregulated provided that they are correctly labeled and there
are no claims of health benefits (68). Furthermore, plants containing
aristolochic acid and its derivatives are readily available for sale on
the internet (table S15).
In light of the wide availability of AA-containing plants, education
and public awareness are paramount for primary prevention. In addi-
tion, the traditional nomenclature is confusing, making it difficult for
consumers and suppliers to be sure of plant identification or of the con-
stituents of multiherb preparations; there is ample evidence that misla-
beling is common (12, 16, 25, 28). This latter point suggests that more
thorough methods for testing herbalproducts, such aschromatographic
fingerprinting, combined with regulatory oversight of the supply chain
could also help reduce exposure (69). Secondary prevention might take
the form of enhanced screening for AA-associated cancers or for kidney
disease in patients suspected or known to be exposed to AA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
This was designed as an exploratory retrospective study, because it was
not known in advance whether HCCs from Taiwan would show evi-
dence of the AA mutational signature or what the signature’s prevalence
might be. As noted above, tumor tissue was obtained from nonconse-
cutive patients, and inclusion of HCCs from Taiwan in this study was
solely based on availability of adequate DNA and was not selected based
on suspicion of AA exposure. After we discovered prevalent AA signa-
ture mutationsin HCCsfromTaiwan, we extended the study to publicly
available somatic mutation data from 1400 tumors.
Patients and preparation of clinical samples
HCCs were diagnosed and classified by histopathological examination
of surgically excised tumors, according to the World Health Organiza-
tion classification system. Snap-frozen liver tumor tissues and matched
normal samples (whole blood) from patients with HCC were obtained
from Chang Gung Memorial Hospital Taiwan (21 patients) and National
Taiwan University (77 patients). The human samples were sourced eth-
ically with informed consent, and their research use was in accordance
with the protocols approved by the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital

icopathological data and information on sequencing.
Whole-exome sequencing and mutation identification
Samples were captured with the Agilent SureSelect V5 exome panels.
Paired 101–base pair reads were generated on HiSeq 2500 sequencers.
BWA-MEM aligned reads to the human reference genome (hg19) (70),
SAMtools removed polymerase chain reaction duplicates (71), and
Qualimap 2 computed quality control metrics (72). Candidate somatic
mutations were initially identified by three callers: GATK (73), Strelka
(74), and MuTect (75). SBS called by ≥2 callers and small indels called
by both GATK and Strelka were curated for downstream analysis. Ex-
amination of ≥1% of SBS calls and ≥1% indel calls from each tumor-
normal pair (with ≥1 mutation from each tumor-normal pair) in IGV
indicated an FDR of 6/312 (1.9%) of SBS calls and 3/93 (3.2%) of indel
calls (table S3). Indels were rare, and their length distribution was un-
remarkable (fig. S8).
Sources of publicly available HCC somatic mutation data
These were as follows: (i) whole-genome sequence (WGS) from 78
HCCs from China (47, 52), in which we had previously noted the AA
signature in 11 tumors (29), downloaded read data from ftp.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov:/sra/sra-instant/reads/ByStudy/sra/ERP/ERP001/ERP001196/
and realigned and called as described (76); (ii) whole-exome sequence
(WES) from 11 HCCs from China (38), variant calls downloaded from
the supplementary information for that paper (http://cancerres.
aacrjournals.org/highwire/filestream/334829/field_highwire_adjunct_files/
1/173141_1_supp_3805627_mj6gp5.xls); (iii) WES and WGS from nine
HCCs in patients from various Southeast Asian countries, treated in
Singapore (39), variant calls downloaded from the supplementary infor-
mation for that paper; (iv) WES from 231 HCCs from Korea (48),
downloaded from cBioPortal (www.cbioportal.org/; 8 February 2017)
(77); (v) WGS from 264 HCCs from Japan (53), downloaded from
the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) data portal
(https://dcc.icgc.org/; March 2015, release 18, before publication of
the paper); (vi) 213 WES from Japan, in which a mutational signature
that,inretrospect,appearstobeamergeoftheAAsignaturewithanother
signature hadbeen reported (46), downloaded from the ICGC dataportal
(https://dcc.icgc.org/; March 2015, release 18); (vii) WES from 230 HCCs
from France, Spain, and Italy, which likely are not regions of widespread
AA exposure (49), downloaded from the ICGC data portal (https://dcc.
icgc.org/, March, 2015, release 18); (viii) WES from 364 HCCs from
North America, Vietnam, and a few other regions (fig. S5I) (37), down-
loaded from the supplementary information from that publication.
Analysis of mutational signatures
We used the R (www.r-project.org/) function prcomp to compute
the first two principal components over 96-channel mutation spectra
(Fig. 1F). The sources of the data were as follows: UTUCs and AA-
exposed cell lines (29), AA BCs (31), and HCCs from Japan (53) and
China (47, 52). Supplementary Materials and Methods and code S1
describe in detail the mSigAct signature presence test and its compar-
ison to the NMF approach in (3, 4).
Allocating mutational signature contributions to mutations
(“weighted mutation counts”)
For a given tumor, we allocated the partial contribution of each signa-
ture to each type of mutation as follows. Let t1 … t96 be the 96 strand
invariant mutation types in trinucleotide context, namely, ACA>AAA,
ACA>AGA, ACA>ATA, CCA>CAA, …, TTT>TAT, TTT>TCT, and
TTT>TGT (see also the labels at the bottom of Fig. 1E). Let nS be the
number of mutational signatures, and lete1…enS be the exposures of the
tumor to each of the signatures. Let p(tj, Si) be the proportion of muta-
tion type tj in signature Si, with 1 ¼ ∑96
j¼1pðtj;SiÞ. Then, in a given
tumor, we define the partial contribution of Si to each instance of tj as
pðtj;SiÞ⋅ei=∑nS
k¼1pðtj;SkÞ⋅ek
in which the denominator ensures that the partial credits sum to 1.
AA signature mutations in driver genes
We used MutSigCV (42) and 20/20+ (43) to identify candidate drivers
in the Taiwan AA HCCs (tables S6 to S8). The MutSigCV preprocessor
was used to generate the MAF file, and MutSigCV was run with default
parameters. 20/20+ was run with default parameters except using the
“pretrained 2020plus_100k.Rdata” classifier.
To analyze nonsilent mutations in known cancer driver genes, we
used the Cancer Gene Census (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/census;
downloaded 3 January 2017) and selected the 159 genes listed as “on-
cogene”or“TSG”(tumorsuppressorgene)inthe“Roleincancer”column
(table S12) (54).
Neoantigen prediction
Nonsynonymous somatic variants were annotated by wANNOVAR
(http://wannovar.wglab.org/) (78), and a custom script generated all
possible 9–amino acid sequences containing the mutated residue. In
silico HLA typing of individual tumors was carried out using OptiType
for major histocompatibility complex class I genes and used for HLA
allele–specific peptide binding predictions (79). NetMHC4.0 and
NetMHCPan2.8 were used to predict peptide binding (80, 81). Rank
parameters >2 were considered nonbinding, and those ≤2 were
considered binding, as suggested in (80).
