IMPORTANCE It is unclear if helping patients meet resource needs, such as difficulty affording
food, housing, or medications, improves clinical outcomes.
OBJECTIVE To determine the effectiveness of the Health Leads program on improvement in
systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP, respectively), low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (LDL-C) level, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A difference-in-difference evaluation of the Health
Leads program was conducted from October 1, 2012, through September 30, 2015, at 3
academic primary care practices. Health Leads consists of screening for unmet needs at clinic
visits, and offering those who screen positive to meet with an advocate to help obtain
resources, or receive brief information provision.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Changes in SBP, DBP, LDL-C level, and HbA1c level. We
compared those who screened positive for unmet basic needs (Health Leads group) with
those who screened negative, using intention-to-treat, and, secondarily, between those who
did and did not enroll in Health Leads, using linear mixed modeling, examining the period
before and after screening.
RESULTS A total of 5125 people were screened, using a standardized form, for unmet basic
resource needs; 3351 screened negative and 1774 screened positive. For those who screened
positive, the mean age was 57.6 years and 1811 (56%) were women. For those who screened
negative, the mean age was 56.7 years and 909 (57%) were women. Of 5125 people
screened, 1774 (35%) reported at least 1 unmet need, and 1021 (58%) of those enrolled in
Health Leads. Median follow-up for those who screened positive and negative was 34 and 32
months, respectively. In unadjusted intention-to-treat analyses of 1998 participants with
hypertension, the Health Leads group experienced greater reduction in SBP (differential
change, −1.2; 95% CI, −2.1 to −0.4) and DBP (differential change, −1.0; 95% CI, −1.5 to −0.5).
For 2281 individuals with an indication for LDL-C level lowering, results also favored the
Health Leads group (differential change, −3.7; 95% CI −6.7 to −0.6). For 774 individuals with
diabetes, the Health Leads group did not show HbA1c level improvement (differential change,
−0.04%; 95% CI, −0.17% to 0.10%). Results adjusted for baseline demographic and clinical
differences were not qualitatively different. Among those who enrolled in Health Leads
program, there were greater BP and LDL-C level improvements than for those who declined
(SBP differential change −2.6; 95% CI,−3.5 to −1.7; SBP differential change, −1.4; 95% CI, −1.9
to −0.9; LDL-C level differential change, −6.3; 95% CI, −9.7 to −2.8).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Screening for and attempting to address unmet basic
resource needs in primary care was associated with modest improvements in blood pressure
and lipid, but not blood glucose, levels.

C
hronic cardiometabolic diseases, such as hyperten-
sion, diabetes, and lipid disorders, are leading causes
of morbidity and mortality in the United States.1,2 The
connection between poor outcomes in these conditions and
unmet resource needs, such as difficulty affording food, hous-
ing, and medications, has become increasingly clear.3-17 This
has led to interest in programs that seek to “link” patients
identified in clinical care sites as having unmet basic resource
needs to community-based resources.18 This interest is
exemplified by the recent Accountable Health Communities
(AHC) model proposed by the Centers for Medicare & Medic-
aid Services (CMS).3 Specifically, interventions to screen for
unmet needs and link patients to community resources in
order to address them are at the heart of track 2 and track 3 of
the AHC model.3
Despite growing interest and intuitive appeal, there is as
yet scant evidence to support the effectiveness of linkage in-
terventions for improving cardiometabolic disease control. To
help understand the potential of linkage interventions in
chronic cardiometabolic disease management, we con-
ducted a pragmatic evaluation of the Health Leads program in
3 primary care practices.19 The Health Leads program in-
cludes screening for unmet resource needs, an assessment of
those who report these needs, and assignment to an advo-
cate, who then works with a patient to receive resources and
benefits to meet those needs.19 For example, a patient who re-
ports difficulty affording food could be assisted with enroll-
ment in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
(SNAP).Conceptually,suchassistancecouldenhanceandmake
more effective the routine care being delivered to patients. For
example, addressing transportation issues could enable pa-
tients to attend a greater proportion of clinic appointments,
and assisting with medication affordability could enable pa-
tients to adhere to their treatment plan more closely. There-
fore, we hypothesized that participation in the Health Leads
program would be associated with improvements in key indi-
cators of cardiometabolic disease management: blood pres-
sure, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and hemo-
globin A1c (HbA1c) control.
Methods
Setting and Study Participants
We conducted a pragmatic evaluation of the Health Leads pro-
gramin3academicadult(age>18years)internalmedicineprac-
tices within a primary care network in the Boston metropoli-
tan area. Patients who presented for routine care completed
screening for unmet basic resource needs at visit check-in. All
who completed screening between October 1, 2013 (when the
program began in the clinics), and April 30, 2015, were in-
cluded in the study. Electronic health record data for partici-
pants were obtained from October 1, 2012 (ie, ≥1 year prior to
screening), through September 30, 2015 (ie, ≥5 months after
screening).
The Health Leads program was implemented as the stan-
dard of care during the study period; therefore, the human
research committee at Partners Health Care approved this
analysis of usual care data with a waiver of the informed con-
sent requirement. Patients were not compensated for their
participation.
Screening and Intervention
The Health Leads program has been described in detail
elsewhere.19 In brief, patients complete a standardized screen-
ing form that allowed the patient to self-identify unmet re-
sourceneedsrelatedtofood,medications,transportation,utili-
ties, employment, elder care services, and housing. Patients
who report unmet needs are referred to program staff to com-
plete an assessment and determine if the patient should be en-
rolled in the program or receive a rapid resource referral, which
consisted of 1-time provision of information. Patients who
choose to enroll in the program are assigned to an advocate,
usually an undergraduate student volunteer, operating un-
der the supervision of professional program staff, who works
with the patient to prioritize unmet basic resource needs, iden-
tify community resources and/or public benefits to meet them,
and facilitate receipt of those resources and/or benefits. Each
situation had standardized guidelines to indicate when a case
could be closed with 1 of 3 resolution types: (1) benefits had
been received (successful), (2) the need was met elsewhere,
could not be met or the advocate lost contact with the patient
(unsuccessful), or (3) the patient indicated they were able to
move forward without continued assistance (equipped).19 As
an example, if a patient reported a food need and was eligible
for but not enrolled in SNAP, the advocate would work with
theparticipantuntiltheywereenrolledandbenefitswereavail-
able on an electronic benefit transfer card.19
Outcomes
Our primary outcome was systolic blood pressure (SBP) trend
because it is the most common cardiometabolic risk factor and
is strongly associated with morbidity and mortality.20 Our sec-
ondary outcomes were diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and
LDL-C and HbA1c levels. These outcomes are targeted for clini-
calmanagementinadultswithpreexistingcardiometabolicdis-
eases. Therefore, for blood pressure outcomes we included
those individuals with a history of hypertension. Similarly, for
analyses of LDL-C levels, participants had a diagnosis of hy-
pertension, coronary heart disease, chronic kidney disease, or
Key Points
Question Does screening for and addressing unmet basic
resource needs in primary care help improve blood pressure and
cholesterol and blood glucose levels?
Findings The Health Leads program screens primary care patients
for unmet basic needs, such as food, medication, housing, and
transportation, and helps link those who report needs to
community resources to address them. In a pragmatic evaluation,
for 5125 patients screened, those who screened positive, and were
encouraged to enter the program, saw statistically significant
improvements in blood pressure and cholesterol levels, but not
blood glucose level, compared with those who screened negative.
Meaning Screening for and attempting to address unmet basic
needs may help primary care be more effective.

diabetesmellitus.ForanalysesofHbA1clevels,weincludedpar-
ticipants with diabetes mellitus. These diagnoses were as-
sessed at time of screening and were determined using previ-
ouslyvalidatedelectronichealthrecordalgorithms,whichhave
been used in prior studies (validation documents are avail-
able on request).19,21,22 Outcome data were collected as part
of routine clinical care. Just as patients often qualify for more
than 1 clinical performance metric, participants could be in-
cluded in the analysis of more than 1 outcome (eg, a partici-
pant with diabetes and hypertension would be included in the
analyses of SBP, DBP, and LDL-C and HbA1c levels).
We also considered several covariates that may influence
the trend in study outcomes. Age, self-reported gender (male
or female), race/ethnicity, educational attainment, health in-
surance, primary language, clinical conditions, and comor-
bidity as indicated by the Charlson comorbidity score were ab-
stracted from the electronic health record and adjusted for in
our analyses.19
Statistical Analysis
We first performed descriptive statistics. Given that the Health
Leadsprogramhadadequatecapacitytoserveallpatientsiden-
tified through screening in the 3 practices, there was no group
of participants who completed screening but were not of-
fered interventional services. Therefore, to test whether pro-
gram referral was associated with improved health out-
comes, we used a difference-in-difference approach. In this
design, participants serve as their own controls by comparing
trends in outcome before and after the intervention. Simulta-
neously, those who received care in the same practices dur-
ing the same time but screened negative for unmet resource
needs were used to account for secular trends: other occur-
rences, aside from the Health Leads program, that may have
influenced the outcomes, such as on-going chronic disease
management programs in the clinics. Our primary analyses
compared those with 1 of the defined conditions who screened
positive (regardless of whether they enrolled in the Health
Leads program) to those with one of the defined conditions
who screened negative for unmet resource needs. Analogous
to an intention-to-treat analysis of a randomized clinical trial
(RCT), this approach provides the best estimate of the real-
world effectiveness of the program. As secondary analyses,
we also examined change in outcome trend by Health Leads
participation category—comparing those who screened nega-
tive to those who screened positive but declined a referral to
Health Leads, those who declined services after an initial
interview with Health Leads, those who received only a rapid
resource referral, and those who fully enrolled in the Health
Leads program. The date of screening demarcated the prein-
tervention and postintervention periods for both groups. Par-
ticipants needed to have at least 1 outcome measurement in
the preperiod and postperiod to be included in the main
analyses, but we conducted sensitivity analyses that did not
include this requirement. We analyzed the outcomes as con-
tinuous variables because blood pressure, LDL-C level, and
HbA1c level have a linear association with poor health out-
comes over most of their clinically relevant range.23-25
Because outcomes could be measured multiple times per
participant and were not measured on a fixed schedule (un-
balanced design), we used longitudinal mixed-effects linear
regression models for hypothesis testing, with patient-level
random effects to account for repeated measurements
within patients. All observations of a particular parameter
(eg, blood pressure) were used for analysis. P < .05 indicated
statistical significance.
Analyses were conducted using SAS statistical software
(version 9.4; SAS Institute).
Results
Overall, 5125 people were screened for unmet basic resource
needs at the participating practices from October 1, 2013, to
April 30, 2015 (Figure 1). Of these, 1774 (34.6%) screened posi-
tive for at least 1 unmet resource need. Of those who screened
positive, they reported a median of 2 (25th percentile: 1; 75th
percentile: 3) unmet needs. Overall, those reporting unmet re-
source needs were more likely to self-identify as a racial/
ethnic minority, have less than a high school diploma–level
education, speak a primary language other than English, and
have Medicaid insurance (Table 1).
Of those who screened positive, 1021 (57.6%) enrolled in
the Health Leads program, 259 (14.6%) declined referral, and
329 (18.6%) declined services after an initial interview. The
most commonly reported needs were in the areas of health
care,includingmedicationaffordability,utilities,andfood.For
those enrolled in Health Leads, cases were open for a median
of 42 days (25th percentile: 24; 75th percentile: 71), and par-
ticipants received a median 5 contacts (25th percentile: 3 con-
tacts; 75th percentile: 9 contacts) from their advocate. Of those
who discussed their needs with Health Leads, 29.7% of re-
ported needs were closed as successful, 27.9% as equipped,
34.9% as unsuccessful, and 7.1% handled with a rapid re-
source referral. Almost all (93.2%) of the unsuccessful cat-
egory involved participants who stopped responding to at-
tempts to contact them from Health Leads advocates.

Forbloodpressureanalyses,832participantswhoscreened
positive and 1166 participants who screened negative met in-
clusion criteria (eTable 1 in the Supplement). For LDL-C analy-
ses, 967 participants who screened positive and 1314 partici-
pants who screened negative were included. For HbA1c
analyses, 452 participants who screened positive and 322 who
screened negative were included. Those who screened posi-
tive represent the Health Leads group for the following analy-
ses. Median time studied was 34 months (25th percentile: 25
months; 75th percentile: 36 months) for those who screened
positive and 32 months (25th percentile: 26 months; 75th per-
centile: 36 months) for those who screened negative. Those
who screened positive had a median time studied prior to
screening of 17 months (25th percentile: 11 months; 75th per-
centile: 26 months), and median time followed after screen-
ing of 12 months (25th percentile: 7 months; 75th percentile:
19 months). Those who screened negative had a median time
studied prior to screening of 25 months (25th percentile: 18
months; 75th percentile: 28 months), and median time fol-
lowed after screening of 6 months (25th percentile: 6 months;
75th percentile: 8 months) (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Of those with hypertension, baseline SBP was slightly
higher (133.1 mm Hg vs 131.8 mm Hg; P = .04) in the Health
Leads group, but DBP was similar (76.6 mm Hg vs 76.3 mm Hg;
P = .35)(Table2andFigure2AandB).Inunadjusteddifference-
in-difference analyses, the differential change after screening
favored the Health Leads group, with greater reduction in SBP
(differential change, −1.2 mm Hg; 95% CI, −2.1 to −0.4 mm Hg)
and DBP (differential change, −1.0 mm Hg; 95% CI, −1.5 to −0.5
mm Hg) (Figure 2). In models adjusted for age, self-reported
gender, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, primary lan-
guage, health insurance, clinical conditions (diabetes, chronic
kidney disease, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular dis-
ease, and depression), and comorbidity score, the differential
change again favored the Health Leads group (differential
change in SBP, −1.6 mm Hg; 95% CI, −2.5 to −0.6 mm Hg; dif-
ferentialchangeinDBP−1.1mmHg;95%CI−1.6to−0.6mmHg).
ForthosewithanindicationforLDL-Clevellowering,base-
line LDL-C level was similar comparing the Health Leads group
(103.0 mg/dL) to those who screened negative (100.2 mg/dL)
(P = .14). Unadjusted difference-in-difference results again fa-
vored the Health Leads group (differential change, −3.7 mg/
dL; 95% CI, −6.7 to −0.6 mg/dL) (Figure 2C). Adjusted results
were similar (differential change, −3.9 mg/dL; 95% CI, −7.2 to
−0.6 mg/dL). (To convert LDL-C to millimoles per liter, mul-
tiply by 0.0259).
For those with diabetes, baseline HbA1c level was greater
in the Health Leads group compared with those who screened
negative(7.53%vs7.19%;P = .002).However,theHealthLeads
group did not see improvement in HbA1c level (differential
change, −0.04%; 95% CI, −0.17% to 0.10%) (Figure 2D). Ad-
justed results also revealed no differential improvement
(0.03%; 95% CI, −0.12 to 0.17). (To convert HbA1c to a propor-
tion of total hemoglobin, multiply by 0.01.)
Insecondaryanalysesbasedonprogramenrollment,rather
than just screening positive for unmet needs, enrollment in
Health Leads was associated with statistically significant ben-
efit in SBP, DBP, and LDL-C level reduction (Table 3). There re-
mained no benefit for HbA1c level reduction. The magnitude
of these benefits was greater than the magnitude seen in the
intention-to-treat analyses. Declining services, being lost to
contact, or receiving a 1-time referral to a resource were gen-
erally not associated with benefit.
Sensitivity analyses that did not require participants to
have an outcome measurement in both the prescreening and
postscreening period were not substantially different from the
main analyses (eTable 3 in the Supplement). Information on
health-related quality of life in a subset of randomly selected
participants (eTable 4 in the Supplement), a responder analy-
sis of those with out-of-control parameters that came under
control in the postintervention period (eTable 5 in the Supple-
ment), and a more detailed breakdown of presenting needs
(eTable 6 in the Supplement) is available in the supplemental
material.
Discussion
In this study, we found that screening for unmet basic needs
coupled with referral to a program that helped link patients
to community resources and public benefits to meet those

This study is consistent with, and extends our knowl-
edge of, health care interventions to address basic resource
needs. While few other programs have focused specifically on
unmet needs, several other strategies to address social deter-
minants of health in clinic care have been tried, with varia-
tions in workforce (lay vs professional), setting (clinic vs com-
munity-based), and on-going interaction (longitudinal
empanelmentvsepisodicengagement).26-36Forexample,com-
munity health worker programs often use a lay workforce,
basedoutsideoftheclinic,whoworkwithspecificpatientsover
a long period of time.29 Alternatively, care coordination and
case management programs are often based in clinics or health
care systems and use professional staff, such as registered
nurses or licensed clinical social workers.32,35 Case manage-
ment programs often feature longitudinal panels, while some
social work referrals are more episodic in nature. Several of
these approaches have achieved success for chronic disease
management, although none focus specifically on unmet ba-
sic needs. This study presents an alternative model—lay clinic–
based undergraduate volunteers, trained and equipped with
tools to address episodic issues with basic resource needs—
and finds that this approach can be successful.
ThemagnitudeofthebenefitsinbloodpressureandLDL-C
level improvement seen in this study may not be important
clinically to an individual but are likely important at the popu-
lation level, particularly considering (1) that the results oc-
curred in patient populations that typically benefit less from
usual medical care, and (2) that there is unlikely to be sub-
stantial harm from participation in the program. The reduc-
tions in blood pressure and LDL-C level seen in patients who
enrolled in Health Leads are similar to those seen in a recent
successful RCT of a multifaceted quality improvement inter-
vention that did not focus on unmet basic resource needs.26
Furthermore, a 2-mm Hg reduction in SBP or a 1-mm Hg re-
duction in DBP is associated with an approximately 5% reduc-
tion in relative risk for coronary heart disease events.24 Simi-

larly, a 4 mg/dL reduction in LDL-C level is associated with a
4%reductioninrelativeriskforcoronaryheartdiseaseevents.23
An unanswered question resulting from this study is why
BP and LDL-C level improved while HbA1c level did not. At this
time, we are not sure why we observed this. Prior studies have
established the importance of improving dietary quality, in ad-
dition to medication, in controlling hyperglycemia.37 The data
inthisstudysuggestthatconnectionstoresourcestomeetvari-
ous needs (eg, medication affordability and food) occur with
equalsuccess.However,theresultofthatconnectionmayvary
depending on the adequacy and efficacy of the resource land-
scape available. For example, reducing financial barriers to
medications (such as may occur if patients enroll in a phar-
macy assistance program) is closely linked to improved ad-
herence and improved health.12 However, connection to food
resources, such as enrollment in SNAP or receipt of food from
a food pantry, while effective for improving food insecurity,
may not support the changes in dietary quality necessary to
improve HbA1c level. The CMS’
s AHC model, which seeks to
testlinkageinterventionstoimprovehealth,acknowledgesthe
important role of the resource landscape.3 In the AHC’
s track
3—Engagement—the CMS calls on health care delivery orga-
nizations to partner with social service providers in the same
community to help tailor the resources available both to meet
basic resource needs and to improve health.3
An important strength of this study is its pragmatic de-
sign. Compared with a highly selected population in an RCT,
this study evaluated program operation in real-world condi-
tions,andwiththeintention-to-treatanalyticapproach,thees-
timates of effects are likely generalizable to other primary care
settingsservingpopulationsthatareunderrepresentedinRCTs.
We should note, however, that clinic-based interventions such
as this one do not reach those who are out of care. Although
participantschosewhethertoenrollintheprogramafterscreen-
ing,wedonotbelievethatdifferencesinengagementwithcare
or self-efficacy among those who enrolled are likely to have in-
fluenced improvement in the study outcomes. The difference-
in-difference design helps account for these unmeasured dif-
ferencesinparticipantcharacteristicsbycomparingparticipants
with their own preintervention results. Furthermore, the lack
of benefit observed with regard to HbA1c level suggests enroll-
ment is not synonymous with improvement. However, with-
out randomization it is impossible to exclude these differ-
encesaspossiblecontributorstothefindingsobserved.Finally,
because program entry was predicated not on having el-
evatedvaluesofthestudyoutcomesbutratheronunmetneeds,
regression to the mean is unlikely to explain the observed dif-
ferences between the groups.
Limitations
Despite these strengths, the results of this study should be in-
terpreted in the light of several limitations. First, the 3 prac-
tices in this study already had advanced population health
management programs that focused on blood pressure and on
cholesterol and HbA1c levels. How these results would gener-
alize to practices without such programs is unclear; it is pos-
sible that other settings could see larger reductions. Never-
theless, the results help understand what can be gained by
adding programs that address unmet basic needs to current
chronic disease management efforts. Second, the study was
set in Massachusetts, where health insurance coverage is
high.38 However, because national health insurance rates are,
after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, rising to
the level of Massachusetts, the results are likely relevant in
many settings.38 Other limitations include lack of informa-
tion on those who did not complete screening, lack of infor-
mation on duration of diabetes and tobacco use, and that the
study analyst was not blinded to the exposure groups.
Thisstudyhasseveralimplicationsforthefuturestudyand
use of linkage interventions. First, the rapid resource referral
used in this study is similar to what is proposed in Track 1 of
the AHC model and did not show benefit.3 Second, because
40% of our participants reporting unmet needs had commer-
cial insurance, linkage programs may be worthwhile in a broad
array of clinical settings. It will be important to determine
whether linkage programs can be combined with ongoing
population management efforts, such as identifying patients
overdue for visits or not meeting clinical goals. In addition, fu-
ture work should focus on improvements to the program that
may increase the benefits seen, and increase the conversion
rate between those reporting needs and ultimate linkage to re-
sources. Also, studies of linkage interventions incorporating
randomized designs, particularly with cluster randomization
above the level of the participant (to include a more real-
world selection of participants compared with participant-
level randomization), would provide important complemen-
taryinformation.Finally,whilethisstudyfocusedonindicators
of cardiometabolic control, there are several other poten-
tiallyimportantoutcomesforalinkageinterventionthatshould
beconsideredwhenevaluatingitsimpact.Health-relatedqual-
ity of life, reduction in stress and depressive symptoms, along
with other indicators of mental well-being, engagement with
care, and the cost-effectiveness of the intervention are all im-
portant areas for future studies to investigate.
Conclusions
An intervention program that screens for unmet basic needs
and attempts to link patients with these needs to community
resources improved blood pressure and LDL-C level but not
HbA1c level. Further refinement of these types of interven-
tions, and their dissemination, holds promise for improving
the health of vulnerable populations.

Targeting Unmet Social Needs—Next Steps Toward Improving
Chronic Disease Management
Ashley M. McMullen, MD; Mitchell H. Katz, MD
Addressing unmet social needs has become increasingly rec-
ognized as a critical component of effective health care deliv-
ery. We know that the everyday conditions in which our pa-
tients live and work affects
their health.1 A lack of basic
resources, such as food and
stablehousing,increasesboth
the risk of developing chronic medical conditions and pre-
sents a substantial barrier to adequate treatment. Thus, in this
era of value-based care and shared-savings initiatives, physi-
cians are further incentivized to routinely identify these “up-
stream” determinants of health as targets for therapeutic in-
tervention. The new Accountable Health Communities (AHC)
model proposed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Ser-
vices (CMS) illustrates this concept by promoting collabora-
tionbetweenclinicalpracticesandcommunity-basedservices.2
Interventions designed to link patients having unmet social
needs with necessary resources in the community represent
1 potential strategy for improving health outcomes and reduc-
ing downstream health expenditures among vulnerable popu-
lations. However, there are minimal data to support the effi-
cacy of such interventions in real-world practice.3
In this issue of JAMA Internal Medicine, Berkowitz et al4
evaluate an established community linkage program, Health
Leads, and its impact on cardiometabolic outcomes among pa-
tients at 3 Boston primary care practices. Patients self-
identified as having unmet needs were optionally enrolled in
the program, which provides an undergraduate advocate to
help determine and facilitate the receipt of appropriate com-
munity resources and/or benefits to meet those needs. The au-
thors then applied intention-to-treat, difference-in-
differences analyses to compare trends in cardiometabolic
parameters before and after intervention. Among those who
screened positive for having unmet needs, 58% were en-
rolled in Health Leads. Individuals in this intent-to-treat group
were found to have modest but significant improvements in
blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lev-
els following intervention compared with those who screened
negative. Effects were sustained even after adjusting for sev-
eral key confounders and baseline trends in disease control at
each practice site. Effects were stronger when limited to those
persons who actually enrolled in the program. The findings in
their study4 demonstrate that we can achieve measurable im-
provements in cardiometabolic outcomes by addressing un-
met needs in the clinical setting. Unfortunately, the authors
were unable to address how meeting these social needs may
have also improved quality of life or other useful nonclinical
outcomes.
In considering how to translate the findings into clinical
practice, there are several critical questions, namely, who
should we be screening for unmet needs and how? Screening
represents a unique challenge for providers given the sensi-
tive nature of socioeconomic hardship and its potential im-
pact on the patient-clinician relationship. As Garg et al5 re-
centlypointedout,thereisaveryrealpossibilityforunintended
harm, especially if such inquiries are perceived as being inva-
sive or judgmental, or if screening generates patient expecta-
tions that are subsequently left unfulfilled. They offer sev-
eral key strategies for minimizing inadvertent damage. To
begin, screening should never occur without the appropriate
