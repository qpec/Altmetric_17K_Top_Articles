Abstract
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common psychiatric disorders, but pharmacological treatments
are ineffective in a substantial fraction of patients and are accompanied by unwanted side effects. Here we evaluated
the feasibility and efficacy of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) at 10 Hz, which we hypothesized would
improve clinical symptoms by renormalizing alpha oscillations in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). To this
end, 32 participants with MDD were randomized to 1 of 3 arms and received daily 40 min sessions of either 10 Hz-
tACS, 40 Hz-tACS, or active sham stimulation for 5 consecutive days. Symptom improvement was assessed using the
Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) as the primary outcome. High-density electroencephalograms
(hdEEGs) were recorded to measure changes in alpha oscillations as the secondary outcome. For the primary outcome,
we did not observe a significant interaction between treatment condition (10 Hz-tACS, 40 Hz-tACS, sham) and session
(baseline to 4 weeks after completion of treatment); however, exploratory analyses show that 2 weeks after
completion of the intervention, the 10 Hz-tACS group had more responders (MADRS and HDRS) compared with 40 Hz-
tACS and sham groups (n = 30, p = 0.026). Concurrently, we found a significant reduction in alpha power over the left
frontal regions in EEG after completion of the intervention for the group that received per-protocol 10 Hz-tACS (n =
26, p < 0.05). Our data suggest that targeting oscillations with tACS has potential as a therapeutic intervention for
treatment of MDD.
Introduction
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common, severe
psychiatric illness that has a lifetime prevalence of about
16.6% in adults1 and results in the highest burden of
disability among all mental and behavioral disorders2.
Current recommended drug therapies are associated with
suboptimal remission rates and, oftentimes, undesirable
side effects3. Furthermore, the effects of pharmacological
agents are widespread; in contrast, interventions that can
target specific abnormalities in brain activity may permit

 greater therapeutic precision. Patients with MDD exhibit
elevated oscillatory activity, specifically in the alpha fre-
quency band (8–12 Hz)4, which is often localized to left
frontal regions, resulting in what has been called “frontal
alpha asymmetry”5. Although alpha oscillations serve
important functions in the healthy brain6,7, increased
alpha oscillation strength in depressed patients represents
a state of neuronal hypoactivity leading to disrupted
affective processing8. Thus, renormalizing this elevated
alpha activity could potentially mitigate symptoms of
MDD. Brain activity can be altered with noninvasive brain
stimulation methods such as transcranial magnetic sti-
mulation (TMS) and transcranial electric stimulation.
Rhythmic TMS bursts at the alpha frequency can entrain
brain activity in healthy humans9, and synchronized TMS
at individualized alpha frequencies has been evaluated for
the treatment of MDD10, although TMS has not yet been
demonstrated to alter alpha oscillations in these patients.
Another stimulation paradigm used to modulate endo-
genous brain activity is transcranial alternating current
stimulation (tACS), which applies a weak electric current
with a sine-wave pattern to the scalp. Such sine-wave
stimulation may better lend itself to targeting oscillatory
brain activity than methods such as TMS. TACS can
modulate cortical oscillations that mediate cognitive
function11 and can selectively modulate oscillations at the
applied frequency12,13. In addition, the side effects of
tACS are mild and transient, and no serious adverse
events have yet been reported14. Despite these promising
results, tACS has not yet been tested as a possible ther-
apeutic intervention for MDD. To address this gap in
knowledge, we hypothesized that tACS at 10 Hz targeting
both left and right frontal areas with synchronous sti-
mulation would improve the symptoms of MDD and
restore a more physiological balance of alpha oscillations
by reducing the pathologically elevated power of the alpha
oscillation in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC).
To test this hypothesis, we conducted a pilot double-blind
study to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of tACS
as a treatment for the symptoms of depression. Patients
diagnosed with MDD were randomized to one of three
arms to compare 10 Hz-tACS, 40 Hz-tACS, and active
sham stimulation. The investigation of a second, different
stimulation frequency (i.e., 40 Hz) served to assess whether
symptom and electrophysiological changes were frequency-
dependent or merely stimulation-dependent. The tACS
intervention comprised 40 min of daily stimulation for 5
consecutive days. The primary outcome was the change in
Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)
score from baseline to the final follow-up study visit 4 weeks
after completion of the intervention. To understand how
tACS affects brain activity, we measured alpha power
changes using high-density electroencephalography as our
secondary outcome.
Materials and methods
This study was a double-blind, randomized, sham-
controlled pilot clinical trial conducted at The University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from May 2015 to June
2017 and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02339285).
The study was approved by the Biomedical Institutional
Review Board at UNC Chapel Hill (IRB # 14-1622) and
used a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) through the
North Carolina Translational & Clinical Studies Institute,
to ensure participant safety. Bi-annual reviews of blinded
data and adverse events were submitted to the DSMB. All
participants provided written informed consent before all
study-related activities.
Participants
A total of 32 patients (27 female; aged 36.69 ± 13.08
years) diagnosed with unipolar, non-psychotic MDD
(confirmed
with
the
M.I.N.I.
International
Neu-
ropsychiatric Interview 7.0 for the Diagnostic Statistical
Manual
of Mental
Disorders,

with a
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) of >8 and low
suicide risk, defined as scoring <3 on the Suicide Item on
the HDRS, were randomized in this trial. Previous treat-
ments include medication (94% reported) and therapy
(69% reported), indicating the enrolled participants in this
sample have attempted to treat their depression before
enrollment. Of the 32 enrolled participants (defined as
intent-to-treat, or ITT, sample), 26 completed all study
visits as designed (defined as per-protocol, or PP, sample;
see CONSORT). Screened participants were excluded
from participation for the following reasons: concurrent
anticonvulsant medications or daily treatments with
benzodiazepines (limited as-needed use that was dis-
continued more than 48 h before a study session was
allowed); diagnosis of alcohol or substance dependence
(other than nicotine) within the last 12 months; current
Axis I mood or psychotic disorder other than MDD;
lifetime comorbid psychiatric bipolar or psychotic dis-
order;
eating
disorder
(current
or
within
the
past
6 months); obsessive-compulsive disorder (lifetime); post-
traumatic stress disorder (current or within the last
6 months); attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (cur-
rently under treatment); history of significant head injury
or traumatic brain injury, prior brain surgery, or any brain
devices/implants; history of seizures, unstable medical
illness, or pregnancy. Although not an exclusion criterion,
none of the participants were left-handed (Edinburgh
Handedness Inventory, 82.8 ± 24.9). Screened participants
were not excluded for use of antidepressants and 38% of
participants were on at least one antidepressant at the
time of enrollment. To control for changes in medication,
participants were required to be at least 6 weeks stable on
their antidepressants. See Table S1 for further baseline
demographics on all randomized participants.

 Study schedule
Participants who completed the study attended a total
of eight sessions (Fig. S1). Inclusion and exclusion criteria
were assessed with a preliminary phone screening and
then more extensively at the initial session with the study
coordinator. At the initial session, participants signed
consent and completed several questionnaires (demo-
graphics,
Edinburgh
handedness
Inventory,
“Hunter
Beliefs About Treatment Questionnaire,” used with per-
mission of the UCLA Laboratory of Brain, Behavior, and
Pharmacology, ©2005, 2017 UC Regents). In addition, the
study coordinator administered the M.I.N.I. and the
HDRS to confirm eligibility. Before randomization, eligi-
ble participants also met with an experienced mood dis-
orders clinician (D.R.R.) to further assess their clinical
symptoms and to verify the participants met the inclusion
criteria. Once eligibility was confirmed, participants
returned for 5 consecutive days of treatment (Day 1 to
Day 5). Baseline scores for all assessments were completed
on Day 1. Participants also attended a 2-week follow-up
and a 4-week follow-up after they completed the week of
stimulation.
Randomization
Participants were randomized into three study arms
(10 Hz-tACS, n = 10; 40 Hz-tACS, n = 11; and active
sham at 10 Hz, n = 11). Intervention type was based on
study codes prepared by a member of the research lab,
who was not otherwise associated with the study, and
codes were randomized such that no more than three
participants in a row received the same intervention. All
authors and members of the research team were unaware
of the group assignments until completion of the entire
study. To administer stimulation in a double-blind man-
ner, we developed a custom Matlab-controlled computer
interface (Mathworks, Natick, MA; NIDaq USB 6001,
National Instruments, TX, USA) to control two Neuro-
conn DC plus stimulators (Neuroconn Ltd., Ilmenau,
Germany) that delivered the stimulation based on the
study code entered. To ensure that the correct waveform
was applied for each session, this interface recorded the
applied waveform for subsequent verification by a group
member not associated with the study.
Stimulation
All three study arms used the same electrode montage
(Fig. 1). Three electrodes with Ten20 paste (Bio-Medical
Instruments, Clinton Township, Michigan) were applied
to the scalp. Two 5 × 5 cm electrodes were placed over the
left and right frontal areas (F3 and F4, respectively, in the
10–20 placement system) with a third 5 × 7 cm “return/
reference” electrode placed over the vertex (Cz in the
10–20 system). The electrode montage described here
delivers in-phase synchronized stimulation to both the left
and right frontal regions to target the imbalance between
frontal alpha activity.
Each participant completed 5 consecutive days of the
intervention (40 min of stimulation) at approximately the
same time of day (±90 min). The choice of intervention
duration (5 consecutive days, 40 min each day) was
informed by a previous study of transcranial direct cur-
rent stimulation, which found efficacy 4 weeks after
completion of treatment15. The tACS stimulation wave-
form was a sine-wave with an amplitude of 2 mA at Cz
and an amplitude of 1 mA at F3 and F4 (amplitudes are
reported as zero-to-peak). There were two tACS condi-
tions: the proposed therapeutic frequency of 10 Hz and
the control frequency of 40 Hz. Previous research indi-
cates that gamma oscillations have a stronger relationship
to cognition16, and would theoretically not target alpha
oscillations and not result in mood symptom changes;
therefore, 40 Hz-tACS would be an appropriate control
frequency for this trial. Active sham stimulation included
20 s of ramp-in to 40 s of 10 Hz-tACS, with a ramp-out of
20 s, for a total of 80 s of stimulation. Both 10 Hz and
40 Hz-tACS included 20 s of ramp-in to 40 min of sti-
mulation, with a ramp-out of 20 s for a total of 2440 s of
stimulation (Fig. 1b). During each stimulation session,
participants were seated comfortably upright with their
eyes open and were asked to focus on a ReefScapes video
(Undersea Productions, Queensland, Australia) presented
on a large projector screen directly in front of them. This
video served the purpose of masking the phosphenes
induced by tACS and keeping all participants in the same
state during stimulation sessions. On the final day of sti-
mulation (Day 5), participants were asked whether they
believed they received stimulation over the past week
(Yes, No, I don’t know) to assess blinding.
High-density electroencephalography
Resting-state EEG (RSEEG) was collected at Day 1
(baseline), Day 5, and the 4-week follow-up, using a 128
channel EEG system (Geodesic EEG system 410, Electrical
Geodesics, Inc., OR, USA). RSEEG was administered
before the final stimulation on Day 5 to avoid recording
the immediate aftereffects of tACS. Participants followed
pre-programmed computer-generated instructions (Pre-
sentation, Neurobehavioral Systems, CA, USA) and had
their eyes closed for 2 min, following which they had their
eyes open for 2 min17. This sequence was repeated twice
resulting in a total of 8 min of RSEEG. The sequence was
counterbalanced across participants, i.e., half of the par-
ticipants started with 2 min of eyes-open condition and
the other half started with 2 min of eyes-closed condition.
During
the
eyes-open
condition,
participants
were
instructed to fixate on a cross-hair. Participants also
completed a working memory task, the results of which
are not presented here.

 EEG analysis was performed using EEGLab18 and
custom-written Matlab scripts. Preprocessing consisted of
band-pass filtering to 1–50 Hz, downsampling to 250 Hz,
removal of bad channels based on low correlations to
surrounding channels, and artifact subspace reconstruc-
tion19 followed by independent component analysis20 to
remove artifacts caused by eye blinks, eye movements,
muscle activity, and heartbeats. EEG data were separated
according to the eyes-open and eyes-closed condition, and
epoched into 10 s segments, following which power
spectral density was estimated using multi-taper wind-
owed fast Fourier transform method21. To determine
changes in RSEEG at Day 5 and the 4-week follow-up,
spectral power in the alpha frequency band (8–12 Hz) was
calculated and decibel-normalized to spectral power
estimated from baseline at each individual electrode as
well as averages within a topographical region. The
former was used to assess significant changes in oscilla-
tion power within each group, whereas the latter was used
to compare changes across the three groups. In addition,
alpha power in baseline session was log-transformed and
compared between the groups.
Side effects and safety
Side effects were assessed after every stimulation session.
Suicidal thoughts/actions were monitored daily with a self-
report questionnaire, starting from baseline until the 4-
week follow-up as well as during clinical assessments
(MADRS and HDRS). Possible development of mania was
monitored with the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)
administered at every study visit from baseline until the 4-
week follow-up. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment
(MoCA) was administered at two time points (baseline, 4-
week follow-up) to assess any possible cognitive changes.

 Outcome measures
The primary outcome measure was defined as the
change in depressive symptoms measured by the MADRS
from baseline to the 4-week follow-up for the ITT sample.
The MADRS was administered before stimulation at
baseline, after the fifth stimulation on Day 5, at the 2-week
follow-up, and the 4-week follow-up. The secondary
outcome was the change in raw alpha power measured at
the 4-week follow-up relative to baseline for the PP
sample. The choice of the 4-week follow-up as the pri-
mary outcome was based on a previous trial using elec-
trical stimulation15. Exploratory outcome measures were
defined as the change in the HDRS and Beck Depression
Inventory (BDI). Response to treatment was defined as at
least a 50% reduction in symptoms from baseline for each
clinical assessment22. Remission for the MADRS was
defined as scoring ≤9, remission for the HDRS was
defined as scoring ≤7, and remission for the BDI was
defined as scoring ≤1223.
Statistical analysis
Custom-written scripts in R (R Foundation for Statis-
tical Computing, Vienna, Austria) were used for analysis
and are available by request. Libraries used in R included
lme424 and pbkrtest25. Differences in demographics and
baseline characteristics of the three study arms and the
severity of adverse effects were assessed with one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA), χ2-tests of independence,
and pairwise t-test with false discovery rate (FDR) cor-
rection. Spearman’s rank-order correlation was used to
assess the possible role of placebo response in the effects
observed using a belief of treatments questionnaire, as the
data was non-parametric. To assess equality of variance,
we used Bartlett’s K-squared. We used a linear mixed
model analysis with fixed factors of “session” (baseline, the
4-week follow-up) and “condition” (10 Hz-tACS, 40 Hz-
tACS, active sham 10 Hz-tACS), with random factor
“participant” to account for repeated measures within
participants. The choice of a linear mixed model for the
main outcome takes into consideration any missing data
in our ITT sample. The interaction between “session” and
“condition” is defined as the effects of “session” on
“condition”. Kenward–Roger approximations were used
to calculate p-values and perform F-tests for each factor
and their interaction in the mixed model. Effect sizes
between groups were calculated using eta-squared (η2),
and effect sizes within groups (baseline to Day 5, 2-week
follow-up,
4-week
follow-up)
were
calculated

Statistical analysis of EEG data was performed using
custom R scripts and the “lmertest” package26, which
allows fitting linear mixed-effects model and uses Sat-
terthwaite’s approximation to degrees of freedom, to
determine the F statistics of the fixed effects. Alpha power
changes were averaged across electrodes over different
topographical regions (frontal, central, occipital, tem-
poral/parietal; Fig. S2A). Alpha asymmetry was measured
as ln
right alpha power

of the pooled average of the left and
right frontal electrodes. Linear mixed-effects models were
fit with power change as the dependent variable, topo-
graphical region and condition as fixed factors and par-
ticipant as random factor. The residuals of the models
were tested for normality using the Shapiro–Wilk test.
Two different models were fit for Day 5 and the 4-week
follow-up. Post-hoc analysis was performed to get con-
trasts adjusted using Tukey’s honest significant difference
(HSD) in the “emmeans” package. Baseline alpha power
differences were determined by fitting a linear model with
log-transformed baseline alpha power as a dependent
variable, and condition and region as factors. To deter-
mine which electrodes exhibited significant power change,
we performed a one-sample t-test with FDR correction.
Spearman’s correlation coefficient was computed between
log-transformed baseline alpha scores and changes.
Sample size determination
The target sample size was 30 participants, with n = 10
for each arm of the study. This sample was chosen based
on funding duration and a focus on feasibility, as this was
the first study to use tACS in this population; however,
several studies of tACS in healthy populations used a
similar sample size to show changes in alpha27,28. A total
of 32 participants were randomized (ITT sample), with 26
completing all study sessions (PP sample). Enrollment
ended because funding had ended.

All codes used to analyze the presented results are
available upon request.
Results
Primary outcome (MADRS)
In the ITT analysis, MADRS scores for all three groups
decreased significantly from baseline to the 4-week fol-
low-up, but there was no significant difference in these
changes based upon condition (10 Hz-tACS, 40 Hz-tACS,
active sham 10 Hz-tACS) (i.e., there was a significant
effect of session (F1,28.618 = 38.87, p < 0.001), but not

(F2,26.559 = 0.65, p = 0.53)).
Secondary outcome (EEG)
To verify whether tACS was effective in engaging alpha
oscillations, we assessed changes in resting-state alpha

 power at Day 5 (Fig. 2a) and the 4-week follow-up
(Fig. 2b) in the PP sample. We performed statistical
analysis of alpha power change at individual electrode
level and at region level. Baseline alpha power was not
different between the three groups (Fig. S2C; linear model
factor condition F2,92 = 0.126, p = 0.881; factor region
F3,92 = 3.727, p = 0.014, interaction F6,92 = 0.042, p =
0.99) nor did we find significant alpha asymmetry in our
participant sample (0.0199 ± 0.0336 (mean ± SEM), p =
0.5584 one-sample t-test) or within any treatment groups
(10 Hz-tACS: −0.0040 ± 0.0592, p = 0.9474; 40 Hz-tACS:
0.0585 ± 0.0548, p = 0.3211; sham: 0.0096 ± 0.0639, p =
0.8847). Post-hoc analysis of contrasts in factor region
revealed that the difference between frontal and occipital
regions (p = 0.020) and the difference between occipital
and parietal regions were significant (p = 0.039), whereas
the difference between central and occipital regions were
trend-level (p = 0.087). At individual electrode level, the
10 Hz-tACS group showed significant decrease over the
left frontal regions (black circles in Fig. 2a, p < 0.05, one-
sample t-test with FDR correction), whereas no effect of
stimulation was observed in the other groups at Day 5 or
in any of the groups at the 4-week follow-up. We did not
find any significant differences between the three stimu-
lation conditions on frontal alpha asymmetry on Day 5
relative
to
Day
1
(F2,23 = 0.24,
p = 0.7852
one-way
ANOVA) nor did we find any significant effect of sti-
mulation on Day 5 relative to Day 1 within any treatment
groups (10 Hz-tACS: 0.0144 ± 0.0330, p = 0.6738; 40 Hz-
tACS:
0.0145 ± 0.0246,
p = 0.5739;
sham:
−0.0171 ±
0.0477, p = 0.7289). We observed significant negative
correlations between the log-transformed baseline alpha
power and alpha power changes at Day 5 in all the regions
(Fig. S2B; Spearman’s rank correlations, Frontal ρ =
−0.45, p = 0.02; Central ρ = −0.54, p < 0.01; Parietal ρ =
−0.65, p < 0.01; Occipital ρ = −0.55, p < 0.01). Thus, we
included the log-transformed baseline alpha power as a
covariate in our analysis of the effects of the intervention.
To assess the effect of stimulation on alpha power on Day
5, we fitted a linear mixed model with power change in
alpha band as dependent variable and condition (3 levels
—10 Hz-tACS, 40 Hz-tACS, and Sham) and regions (4
levels—frontal, central, parietal, and occipital) as fixed
factors and participants as random factors. ANOVA of the
model revealed significant effect of condition (F2,21.595 =
3.931, p = 0.035) and region (F3,79.358 = 7.762, p < 0.001).

 There was no significant effect of interaction (F6,68.284 =
1.073, p = 0.388). Post-hoc analysis of contrasts in factor
condition using Tukey’s HSD revealed significant differ-
ence between 10 Hz-tACS group and 40 Hz-tACS group
(p = 0.039). For factor region, significant differences were
found between frontal and occipital (p < 0.001), central
and occipital (p < 0.01), and frontal and parietal (p < 0.05),
whereas the difference between occipital and parietal was
trend-level (p < 0.1). ANOVA of the linear mixed model
for alpha power changes at the 4-week follow-up revealed
significant effect of only region (F3,80.094 = 2.921, p =
0.039). There was no significant effect of condition
(F2,22.722 = 0.629, p = 0.542), whereas interaction was
trend-level (F6,69.170 = 2.019, p = 0.075). Post-hoc analysis
revealed that the differences between frontal and occipital,
and central and occipital were trend-level (p < 0.1). At
individual electrode level, the 10 Hz-tACS group showed
significant decrease from baseline to Day 5 over the left
frontal regions (black circles in Fig. 2a, p < 0.05, one-
sample t-test with FDR correction), whereas no effect of
stimulation was observed in the other groups at Day 5 or
in any of the groups at the 4-week follow-up. There was
no statistically significant correlation between change in
alpha asymmetry and change in MADRS (ρ = 0.0316, p =
0.8784) nor between change in frontal alpha oscillations
and change in MADRS (ρ = 0.1865; p = 0.6397). Taken
together, our results indicate that 10 Hz-tACS was effec-
tive in targeting alpha oscillations predominantly in the
frontal and central regions, but this change did not have a
relationship with change in clinical symptoms. Similar
analysis of eyes-closed data did not reveal any significant
effect of stimulation in alpha power change.
Response and remission (MADRS, HDRS, BDI)
Within the ITT sample, we found a significant rela-
tionship between condition and response rates for the
MADRS (χ2 = 7.334, df = 2, p = 0.026) and HDRS (χ2 =
7.334, df = 2, p = 0.026) at the 2-week follow-up. This
indicates that the 10 Hz-tACS group had a higher rate of
response at the 2-week follow-up (77.8%) than the 40 Hz-
tACS (30.0%) and sham stimulation groups (20.0%)
(Fig. 3). No other significant relationships were found for
response rates (Table 1). We also looked into remission
rates over the course of the intervention; however, around
half of participants did not qualify for remission at any
time point as measured by the MADRS (59% did not
remit), the HDRS (50% did not remit), and the BDI (41%
did not remit). No significant relationships were found for
remission rates (Table 1).
Effect sizes (MADRS, HDRS, BDI)
In exploratory analyses, we calculated effect sizes
between and within the treatment groups in the ITT
sample. We looked at the mean (SD) change in MADRS
from baseline to Day 5, the 2-week follow-up, and the 4-
week follow-up (Table S2). The change in scores from
baseline to the 4-week follow-up demonstrated a mod-
erate effect size between conditions (η2 = 0.060) and the
largest effect size was seen in the change from baseline to
the 2-week follow-up (η2 = 0.116). We also calculated
Cohen’s d in each treatment group from baseline to Day 5,
the 2-week follow-up, and the 4-week follow-up. For
the MADRS, the largest within-group effect size was seen
in the 10 Hz-tACS group from baseline to the 2-week
follow-up (d = 1.70), with the next largest seen in the
10 Hz-tACS group from baseline to the 4-week follow-up
(d = 1.60).
We next sought to validate the effect of tACS on
improving MDD symptoms by including analogous
rating scales. The HDRS was used as a complementary
outcome measure to the MADRS and the scores were
strongly correlated (R2 = 0.85, p < 0.001). The mean
(SD) change in HDRS from baseline to the 4-week fol-
low-up was −8.67 (5.32) for 10 Hz-tACS, −5.20 (5.67)
for 40 Hz-tACS, and −5.11 (7.61) for sham stimulation.
Similar to the MADRS, this change demonstrated a
moderate between-group effect size (η2 = 0.071). For the
HDRS, the largest within-group effect size was seen in
the 10 Hz-tACS group from baseline to the 4-week
follow-up (d = 1.61), with the next largest seen in the
10 Hz-tACS group from baseline to the 2-week follow-
up (d = 1.58).
In addition, the BDI was collected as a self-report
measure of symptom changes and was strongly correlated
with the MADRS (R2 = 0.72, p < 0.001). The mean (SD)
change in BDI from baseline to the 4-week follow-up was
−14.78 (13.14) for 10 Hz-tACS, −12.20 (11.68) for 40 Hz-
tACS, and −12.33 (10.71) for sham stimulation. This
change demonstrated a small between-group effect size
(η2 = 0.011). For the BDI, the largest within-group effect
size was seen in the 10 Hz-tACS group at the 4-week
follow-up (d = 1.54), with the next largest seen in
the sham group from baseline to the 2-week follow-up
(d = 1.44).
Safety
We used one-way ANOVAs to determine group dif-
ferences in the experience and expectations of side effects
(Table S3). Participants from all three groups reported
minimal side effects and there was no difference between
the three groups with the exception of “flickering lights”
(or phosphenes, p = 0.014). We ran post-hoc paired t-
tests with FDR correction and found that there was not a
significant difference in this side effect between 10 Hz-
tACS and 40 Hz-tACS (p = 0.99); however, there was a
trend-level difference between 10 Hz-tACS and sham
(p = 0.09), and a significant difference between 40 Hz-
tACS and sham (p < 0.01).

 After enrollment, four participants in the sham stimu-
lation group experienced an increase in suicidal ideation
and one of these four participants reported suicidal plans
(i.e., scoring >3 on the suicide item on the HDRS). No
participants in the 10 Hz-tACS and 40 Hz-tACS groups
experienced an increase in suicidal ideation from baseline
during the course of the study.
No participants developed mania or hypomania at any
point during study participation based on the YMRS. Two
adverse events were reported during the course of the
study; however, after a thorough investigation, neither
were determined to be related to the study or interven-
tion. Finally, participants from all three groups experi-
enced a small improvement in cognition from baseline to
the
4-week
follow-up
as
measured
by
the
MoCA
(Table S2). There was no significant difference in this
improvement in relation to condition across sessions
(F2,25.717 = 1.354, p = 0.276).
Blinding
Self-report responses from participants on whether they
thought they received verum stimulation (Yes, No, I don’t
know) and the treatment group (10 Hz-tACS, 40 Hz-
tACS, sham) were significantly related (χ2 = 8.304, df = 2,
p = 0.016). Those who received 40 Hz-tACS were more
likely to think they had been stimulated, with 90% cor-
rectly reporting that they received stimulation. For those
who
received
10 Hz-tACS,
40%
reported
that

Expectations of treatment
We ran one-way ANOVAs on expectations of treatment
(Item 1: expected likelihood of symptom improvement;
Item 2: expected improvement in symptoms) to assess
whether there were group differences in these expecta-
tions of treatment, and there were not (p = 0.409, p =
0.990, respectively). There was no significant relationship
between either of these items and the percent change in
MADRS score from baseline to the 2-week follow-up
(Item 1: ρ = 0.343, p = 0.054; Item 2: ρ = 0.317, p = 0.078)
and from baseline to the 4-week follow-up (Item 1: ρ =
0.273, p = 0.131; Item 2: ρ = 0.243, p = 0.181). Post-hoc
analysis shows that the trend-level relationship between
expectations
and
percent
change
in
MADRS
from
baseline to the 2-week follow-up was driven by the sham
group (Item 1: ρ = 0.778, p = 0.005; Item 2: ρ = 0.693,
p = 0.018), but not the 10 Hz-tACS (Item 1: ρ = −0.072,
p = 0.843; Item 2: ρ = 0.114, p = 0.753) or 40 Hz-tACS
groups (Item 1: ρ = 0.363, p = 0.272; Item 2: ρ = 0.080,
p = 0.816).
Discussion
This pilot clinical trial was designed to evaluate the
feasibility, safety, and preliminary efficacy of tACS as a
treatment for the symptoms of MDD. Although our pri-
mary outcome measure, change in MADRS at the 4-week
follow-up in the ITT sample, was not significantly dif-
ferent between the groups, 10 Hz-tACS significantly out-
performed 40 Hz-tACS and sham stimulation in terms of
response rates at the 2-week follow-up. These results were
consistent
in
both
clinician-administered
measures
(MADRS, HDRS). In addition, 10 Hz-tACS was also

 effective in engaging alpha oscillations compared with
sham or 40 Hz-tACS. Taken together, our results suggest
that targeting alpha oscillations with tACS is a potentially
viable therapeutic approach and a fully powered sub-
sequent study is justified to further establish tACS as a
treatment for depression.
Stimulation was tolerated well by the participants, with
no serious adverse events related to the stimulation
reported and no development of mania, hypomania, or
increase in suicidal ideation as a result of stimulation.
Retention rates were high for all three groups. These data
indicate that future trials using tACS are feasible in this
population.
Our physiological target in this study was frontal alpha
oscillations. Altered alpha oscillations are thought to be a
key physiological marker in patients with MDD. Resting
state recordings in patients with MDD are characterized
by increased synchrony in the theta and alpha frequency
bands4,29, the latter of which likely emerges from abnor-
mal thalamocortical connectivity30. In addition, alpha
activity in the left frontal regions has been shown to be
higher than that of the right frontal regions5,31,32. This
increased, asymmetric alpha activity is thought to reflect
reduced neuronal activity in the left dlPFC, one of several
key regions identified as abnormal in brain imaging stu-
dies of depression8,33. Although repetitive TMS (rTMS)
studies for treating depression often use stimulation fre-
quencies around the alpha band34, the effect of rTMS on
oscillations in patients with MDD has seldom been
demonstrated, except in a few case studies35,36. The
10 Hz-tACS led to significantly reduced alpha oscillations
over the left frontal regions along with the highest
response rates, suggesting that successful reshaping of
disrupted oscillations may have led to the decreased
symptoms observed, despite the fact that alpha asymmetry
was not observed in our sample. This indicates that
10 Hz-tACS may have a therapeutic effect regardless of
asymmetry. However, our interpretation of the results is
limited by the fact that we did not collect RSEEG data at
the 2-week follow-up. In studies with healthy volunteers,
tACS has often been suggested to increase alpha power
immediately after stimulation with effects lasting up to
70 min27,28,37. In contrast, our results indicate a decrease
in alpha power. The differences could be attributed to
dosage (five sessions of 40 min stimulation vs. one session
of 20 min stimulation). Alternatively, the differences could
be due to the altered network oscillations in patients with
MDD (i.e., the impact of tACS may differ in the presence
of abnormal alpha activity). The exact mechanism of
tACS has not yet been determined. Studies suggest tACS
could induce entrainment of cortical oscillations or plas-
ticity (or likely a combination of both)12,28,38. The effects
of periodic perturbation have been shown to be state-
dependent,
further
confounding
the
possible
mechanism27,39,40. Although the immediate after-effect of
tACS may be enhancement in alpha power, repeated
application of tACS may lead to a resetting of oscillators
potentially through homeostatic mechanisms resulting in
a decrease in alpha power, as is proposed for rTMS41.
Further studies are required to determine the mechanisms
underlying the effect of tACS in patients with aberrant
network oscillations.
Despite
the
promising
results
as
measured
by
clinician-administered assessments (MADRS, HDRS),
we did not see the same results in the self-report
measure of the BDI. This may be due to the different
time frame (past week vs. past 2 weeks) or that patients
may have a delay in recognizing symptom changes
compared to clinicians.
This study has several limitations. First, this was an
exploratory pilot study with a small sample size, powered
to detect only large effect sizes. Although we determined
our sample sizes based on previous tACS results, our
study investigated effects at a longer time frame compared
with the previous studies. Second, blinding was not suc-
cessful in the 40 Hz-tACS group; however, the blinding
was successful in the 10 Hz-tACS group, indicating that,
at least in this group, the change in symptoms may be
more related to the stimulation and less likely a placebo
effect. Third, further studies with EEG data collection
before and after each stimulation session will be required
to strengthen the evidence for alpha oscillations as the
target for the 10 Hz-tACS intervention. Finally, as this was
a small pilot study, the heterogeneity introduced by
medication, therapy, duration of illness, etc., may have
affected our results.
To our knowledge, this is the first time tACS has been
studied for the treatment of MDD, demonstrating that it
may be a feasible and efficacious treatment in this
population. With these results, the next steps would be to
validate these results in a larger sample that can establish
the use of tACS to treat MDD. Future directions may also
include investigating dosage, maintenance treatment, and
following participants for longer than 4 weeks after
treatment.
