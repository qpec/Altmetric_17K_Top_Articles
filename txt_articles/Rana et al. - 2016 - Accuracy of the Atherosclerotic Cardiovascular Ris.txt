Abstract
Background—The accuracy of the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart 
Association (ACC/AHA) risk equation for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events 
in contemporary and ethnically diverse populations is not well understood.
Objectives—We sought to evaluate the accuracy of the 2013 ACC/AHA risk equation within a 
large, multiethnic population in clinical care.
Methods—The target population for consideration of cholesterol-lowering therapy in a large, 
integrated health care delivery system population was identified in 2008 and followed through 
2013. The main analyses excluded those with known ASCVD, diabetes mellitus, low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol levels <70 or ≥190 mg/dl, prior statin use, or incomplete 5-year follow-up.

 Patient characteristics were obtained from electronic medical records and ASCVD events were 
ascertained using validated algorithms for hospitalization databases and death certificates. We 
compared predicted versus observed 5-year ASCVD risk, overall and by sex and race/ethnicity. 
We additionally examined predicted versus observed risk in patients with diabetes mellitus.
Results—Among 307,591 eligible adults without diabetes between 40 and 75 years of age, 
22,283 were black, 52,917 Asian/Pacific Islander, and 18,745 Hispanic. We observed 2,061 
ASCVD events during 1,515,142 person-years. In each 5-year predicted ASCVD risk category, 
observed 5-year ASCVD risk was substantially lower: 0.20% for predicted risk <2.50%; 0.65% for 
predicted risk 2.50 to 3.74%; 0.90% for predicted risk 3.75 to 4.99%; and 1.85% for predicted risk 
≥5.00%, with C: 0.74. Similar ASCVD risk overestimation and poor calibration with moderate 
discrimination (C: 0.68 to 0.74) was observed in sex, racial/ethnic, and socioeconomic status 
subgroups, and in sensitivity analyses among patients receiving statins for primary prevention. 
Calibration among 4,242 eligible adults with diabetes was improved, but discrimination was worse 
(C: 0.64).
Conclusions—In a large, contemporary “real-world” population, the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort 
risk equation substantially overestimated actual 5-year risk in adults without diabetes, overall and 
across sociodemographic subgroups.

Introduction
Publication of the 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart 
Association (AHA) Pooled Cohort risk equation for estimating atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease ASCVD risk is considered an important step forward, as it estimates 
risk for both heart disease and stroke, and provides estimates applicable to black/African 
Americans (1,2).
This equation was developed from several prospective U.S.-based cohorts of enrolled 
volunteers, primarily conducted in the 1990s, with limited ethnic diversity and age range. 
Predicted ASCVD risk using the equation was reported to be systematically higher than 
observed risk in some highly selected cohorts (3,4), but not in others (5). Importantly, 
however, these studies included persons screened for participation or enrolled in clinical 
trials, or in much earlier time periods, with limited generalizability to contemporary and 
diverse populations that are more representative of eligible patients treated in typical clinical 
practice (6,7). Validation efforts in more contemporary cohorts have further been limited due 
to inclusion of analyzed participants treated with statin therapy or having a high likelihood 
of initiating statins during follow-up (4,6,8). Lack of comprehensive surveillance in some 
studies is another possible reason for overestimation by the Pooled Cohort risk equation due 
to underascertainment of ASCVD events (3,9).
Another major knowledge gap is the lack of accurate ASCVD risk estimation specific to 
persons of Asian/Pacific Islander and Hispanic ethnicities, who are currently combined with

 the white population in the Pooled Cohort risk equation (10). Furthermore, patterns of risk in 
more contemporary, community-based populations may be significantly different from the 
older cohorts used to derive the Pooled Cohort risk equation, which does not reflect the 
recent treatment era and risk factor levels (11,12). Estimates suggest that nearly half of U.S. 
adults and up to 65% of European adults would be eligible for statins on the basis of new 
ACC/AHA cholesterol guidelines using the Pooled Cohort risk equation (13,14). Thus, 
evaluating the accuracy of ASCVD risk prediction is essential if it is being used as a 
decision-making tool to determine which persons should receive statin therapy for primary 
prevention (13,15), and it could have far-reaching impact if applied at a population level.
To address these knowledge gaps, we examined a very large, contemporary, multiethnic, 
community-based “real-world” population whose clinical characteristics would typically 
trigger a discussion of initiation of cholesterol-lowering therapy per risk assessment by the 
Pooled Cohort risk equation (i.e., patients 40 to 75 years of age, without known ASCVD or 
diabetes, who have low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] levels between 70 and 189 
mg/dl) and compared predicted versus observed 5-year risks of ASCVD events, overall and 
within sex and multiple ethnic subgroups, along with measures of calibration and 
discrimination. We also repeated the analyses among a cohort of eligible adults with diabetes 
mellitus.
Methods
Source population
Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) is a large integrated healthcare delivery 
system providing comprehensive inpatient and outpatient care to ∼4 million ethnically 
diverse persons who are highly representative of the local and statewide population (16).
Study sample
Using outpatient laboratory databases, we initially identified all members of KPNC between 
January 1 and December 31, 2008 who were ≥21 years of age and had LDL-C levels from 
70 to 189 mg/dl within 5 years before study entry. We used the earliest LDL-C measurement 
in the year 2008 as the index date or, if their last available LDL-C was prior to 2008, January 
1, 2008 was used as the index date. We excluded those who met any of the following 
criteria: unknown sex or race/ethnicity; prescribed statins or other lipid-lowering therapies 
within 5 years before the index date; prior hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction, 
ischemic stroke, or receipt of coronary artery bypass surgery or percutaneous coronary 
intervention, identified from health plan hospital discharge or billing claims databases using 
previously validated methods (17,18); <12 months of continuous membership and pharmacy 
benefit before the index date (to ensure more complete information on clinical 
characteristics); and <5 years of complete follow-up, except if due to death. On the basis of 
the requirements of the ASCVD risk calculator, we also excluded patients with missing 
systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) 
information. We further excluded patients who received statins during follow-up if used for 
primary prevention of ASCVD (i.e., statin initiated before a documented ASCVD event) on 
the basis of filled dispensings found in pharmacy databases. The cohort was then stratified

 by diabetes mellitus status at index date on the basis of data from a validated regional 
diabetes registry (20,21).
Prediction of ASCVD risk
We calculated the 10-year ASCVD predicted risk score for cohort members between 40 and 
75 years of age, as per the guideline-recommended ASCVD prevention age group (1,13). To 
directly compare observed versus predicted ASCVD risk at 5-year follow-up, we annualized 
the 10-year predicted ASCVD risk and categorized the population into 4 groups of estimated 
5-year risk: <2.50%; from 2.50% to <3.75%; from 3.75% to <5.00%; and 5.00% or higher, 
as was previously done (8).
Ascertainment of ASCVD events
Follow-up occurred through December 31, 2013. ASCVD events were defined as acute 
myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease (CHD) death, or fatal or nonfatal ischemic 
stroke. Myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke were identified from comprehensive 
health plan hospital discharge or billing claims databases on the basis of previously validated 
algorithms (17-19) using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition (ICD-9) 
primary discharge codes. Coronary death was on the basis of International Classification of 
Diseases, Tenth Edition (ICD-10) codes (I11, I20–I25) (22) obtained from state death 
certificate files through 2013, which was the latest available information at the time of 
analysis.
Covariates
We characterized comorbidity during a 5-year period before the index date on the basis of 
relevant ICD-9 diagnosis and procedure codes (19,23) from health plan electronic medical 
records and a regional diabetes registry (20,21). We collected baseline data on age, sex, self-
reported race/ethnicity, cigarette smoking status, and body mass index (BMI) from 
electronic medical records. We ascertained ambulatory measures of baseline total 
cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, systolic blood pressure, and use of antihypertensive medication 
within 5 years before the index date from comprehensive health plan laboratory, outpatient 
visit and pharmacy databases.
Analytic approach
Analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.3 (Cary, North Carolina). We compared 
baseline characteristics across predicted ASCVD risk categories using ANOVA for 
continuous variables and chi-squared tests for categorical variables. We calculated the 5-year 
incidence of ASCVD events with 95% confidence limits using the first hospitalized acute 
myocardial infarction, first hospitalized ischemic stroke, or coronary death observed during 
follow-up. The 5-year expected incidence of ASCVD risk was on the basis of the mean 
ASCVD predicted risk and associated 95% confidence interval (CI) among patients whose 
predicted risk fell within each risk category. We then examined the observed and expected 5-
year incidence of ASCVD events among nondiabetic patients between 40 and 75 years of 
age, overall and stratified by sex, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, 
Asian/Pacific Islander, and Hispanic) and measures of socioeconomic status using U.S.

 Census-based residential block-level data (18). We also separately examined the observed 
and expected 5-year ASCVD incidence among eligible diabetic patients between 40 and 75 
years of age.
Accuracy was assessed by evaluating calibration and discrimination. Following the approach 
used by Cook and Ridker (11), calibration plots were generated comparing observed versus 
expected risk of ASCVD events within each estimated risk categories. Discrimination was 
assessed using the C statistic from a logistic regression model evaluating predicted risk 
categories with observed 5-year ASCVD event risks. Finally, as a sensitivity analysis, we 
examined the accuracy of the risk equation among eligible adults with and without diabetes 
who received statin therapy for primary prevention during the follow-up period.
Results
Study cohort and baseline characteristics
We identified 307,591 eligible adults aged 40 to 75 years who did not have diabetes, prior 
ASCVD, prior receipt of lipid-lowering therapy, and who had complete 5-year follow-up 
(Figure 1). In addition, we separately identified 4,242 diabetic patients who did not have 
known ASCVD, prior lipid-lowering therapy, or any other exclusion criteria (Figure 1).
Among eligible adults without diabetes, mean age was 54.8 years and 61.6% were women, 
with 22,283 being black/African American, 52,917 being Asian/Pacific Islander, and 18,745 
being Hispanic. Nearly one-third were former or current smokers, 28% were obese and 33% 
were on medication for hypertension (Table 1).
Fifty-seven percent of patients were in the lowest (<5%) category of 10-year predicted 
ASCVD risk, with 12% having predicted risk 5.0% to <7.5%, 8% having predicted risk 
7.5% to <10%, and the remaining 23% having predicted risk ≥10% (Table 1). Patients with 
higher predicted ASCVD risk were more likely to be older and male, be former or current 
smokers, have higher systolic blood pressure and BMI, lower HDL-C, and higher LDL-C 
(Table 1).
Accuracy of ASCVD risk equation by diabetes status
Among eligible patients 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes, 2,061 ASCVD events were 
observed during 1,515,142 person-years, with 1,464 (0.5%) acute myocardial infarctions, 
525 (0.2%) CHD deaths, and 71 (0.02%) ischemic strokes. The cumulative risk of ASCVD 
events was linear during the entire 5-year follow-up period (Figure 2). Observed 5-year 
ASCVD incidence was substantially lower than the predicted risk in each category: 0.20% 
(95% CI: 0.20% to 0.25%) for predicted risk <2.50%; 0.65% (0.55% to 0.70%) for predicted 
risk 2.50% to <3.75%; 0.90% (0.75% to 1.00%) for predicted risk 3.75% to <5.00%: and 
1.85% (1.75% to 1.95%) for predicted risk ≥5.00% (Central Illustration). Calibration 
between the predicted versus observed 5-year ASCVD incidence was poor (Figure 4) and 
the discrimination was moderate (C: 0.74).
Among eligible 40- to 75-year-olds with diabetes, 148 events were observed during 19,196 
person-years, with 84 (2%) acute myocardial infarctions, 54 (1.3%) CHD deaths, and 10

 (0.2%) ischemic strokes. Observed 5-year ASCVD incidence in each predicted risk category 
was: 0.10% (0.00% to 0.85%) for predicted risk <2.50%; 2.55% (1.35% to 4.95%) for 
predicted risk 2.50% to <3.75%; 2.65% (1.30% to 5.30%) for predicted risk 3.75% to 
<5.00%; and 5.50% (4.60% to 6.50%) for predicted risk ≥5.00% (Central Illustration). 
Calibration was fair between predicted versus observed 5-year risk of ASCVD events, and 
discrimination was only modest (C: 0.64) (Figure 4).
Accuracy of ASCVD risk equation by sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status
Among both nondiabetic men and women, there was systematic overestimation of observed 
5-year ASCVD incidence in each predicted risk category, with similarly poor calibration in 
both sexes (Figures 3 and 4). Discrimination in nondiabetic women (C: 0.72) was better than 
in men (C: 0.68).
Given that Asian/Pacific islanders and Hispanics are considered under “white or other” in 
the ASCVD risk equation, we compared the observed versus predicted 5-year ASCVD 
incidence separately among non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, Asian/Pacific 
Islanders, and Hispanics. We found systematic overestimation of actual ASCVD risk in each 
of these ethnic groups (Figure 3) and similarly poor calibration, but with discrimination 
varying in each group (C: 0.70 to 0.74) (Figure 4). Results were also similar across measures 
of socioeconomic status (Figure 4).
Assessment of ASCVD risk equation in persons treated with statins for primary prevention
In sensitivity analyses, we separately examined eligible adults who did or did not have 
diabetes, but received statin therapy for primary prevention during follow-up. We found that 
in eligible adults without diabetes, there was overestimation of actual 5-year ASCVD 
incidence in each predicted risk category (Online Figure 1). Observed rates for this 
population were approximately 6× lower than predicted. In contrast to findings in untreated 
eligible patients with diabetes, we found that there was systematic overestimation of 
observed 5-year ASCVD incidence in each predicted risk category among eligible adults 
with diabetes who received statin therapy for primary prevention (Online Figure 1). 
Calibration was poor and discrimination was modest in both those with (C: 0.61) and 
without (C: 0.68) diabetes who received statin therapy for primary prevention (Online Figure 
2).
Discussion
In a large, contemporary, “real world” cohort with broad racial/ethnic diversity, we showed 
that the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort risk equation substantially overestimated actual 5-year 
ASCVD risk in each predicted risk category within eligible adults without diabetes (40 to 75 
years of age without known ASCVD and with LDL-C 70 to 189 mg/dl) who are a 
recommended target population for consideration of cholesterol-lowering therapy. 
Importantly, this overestimation was similar in both men and women, as well as in 4 major 
ethnic groups, with poor calibration in each subgroup. Discrimination, as measured by the C 
statistic, was fair to moderate, depending on the patient group. Of interest, we found better

 calibration among eligible adults aged 40 to 75 years with diabetes, but worse 
discrimination.
Since release of the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol treatment guidelines, there has been an 
ongoing debate, especially regarding application of the new Pooled Cohort risk equation for 
assessing ASCVD risk within and outside the United States. In selected U.S.-based 
prospective cohorts not used to derive the Pooled Cohort risk equation, such as the MESA 
(Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) and the REGARDS (REasons for Geographic and 
Racial Differences in Stroke) studies, the estimated ASCVD risk was higher than observed 
risk (3,4). Similarly, in a European population 55 years of age or older, the risk equation had 
poor calibration (15). It has been proposed that results of these and related evaluation efforts 
are limited due to ∼25% of participants taking statins or having a high likelihood of 
initiating statin during follow-up (6,8). Underascertainment of ASCVD events in these 
studies has also been suggested as a possible reason for observed overestimation of risk 
(3,9). There is also concern as to how well the risk equation works in more contemporary 
patients compared with the older cohorts used to derive the equation (3,11,12). Analyses 
from the Women's Health Study estimated hypothetical rates if no women were prescribed 
statins or underwent revascularization and suggested that after accounting for intervention 
effects of statins and revascularization, as well as hypothetical confounding by indication or 
underascertainment of events, there would still be a discrepancy in the observed versus 
predicted ASCVD risk (11). However, because that study enrolled primarily white female 
nurses between 1992 and 1995, the results are not necessarily generalizable to more diverse, 
contemporary populations. Similarly, recent analyses from the MESA study share the 
important limitation of lack of generalizability, as research participants are not likely to 
accurately represent the general population in clinical practice and during a recent treatment 
era (4).
Our study addresses many of these challenges. First, we evaluated the accuracy of the 
Pooled Cohort risk equation in the most contemporary cohort studied to date, with study 
entry in 2008 and complete follow-up through 2013. Secondly, we excluded patients who 
had received any statin therapy during the 5 years before or anytime during follow-up, thus 
minimizing any confounding from statin use when evaluating performance of the risk 
calculator. Thirdly, as we studied patients receiving care within an integrated healthcare 
delivery system, we had complete ascertainment of ASCVD events. Fourthly, even after 
restricting to the target population of nondiabetic adults, 40 to 75 years of age, who had 
LDL-C between 70 and 189 mg/dl and no known ASCVD, we studied a very large 
population of 311,827 men and women, which is notably larger and more representative than 
any prior studies (e.g., 3,433 adults ≥55 years of age, including diabetics, in the Rotterdam 
Study (15) and 10,997 from the REGARDS study with a selected subset of 3,333 
participants ≥65 years of age linked to Medicare claims data (8)). Fifthly, we examined 4 
major racial/ethnic groups, including Asian/Pacific Islanders and Hispanics, which 
constitute a major proportion of the U.S. population (24). Present guidelines (1) caution 
against applying this algorithm to groups that are neither white nor black/African American, 
and we further demonstrated that the Pooled Cohort risk equation overestimated actual 
ASCVD risk across all 4 ethnic groups in our study population with variable discrimination. 
Finally, in contrast to previous cholesterol treatment guidelines (25), the Pooled Cohort risk

 equation includes diabetes as part of the scoring criteria, rather than considering it a CHD 
equivalent, and a recent study showed important differences in predicted risk among those 
with diabetes (26). We found that calibration was improved, but discrimination was poorer 
for untreated eligible adults with diabetes; importantly, we showed a wide range of ASCVD 
risk in these patients, which could inform future studies evaluating different thresholds for 
initiating statin therapy in patients with diabetes.
Our study also had several limitations. First, we used 5-year versus 10-year follow-up, and it 
is possible that incidence rates in the first 5 years of follow-up could be less than in the 
subsequent 5 years. However, we observed a cumulative risk of ASCVD that was linear 
during the 5-year follow-up (Figure 2), which directly supports extrapolation of our results 
to 10-year risk. Studying 5-year risk also allowed for a very contemporary estimate of 
ASCVD risk. Risk score overestimation may have been due to exclusion of those who were 
started on statins; however, in a sensitivity analysis, there was poor calibration and 
suboptimal discrimination of the Pooled Cohort risk equation in eligible patients, with or 
without diabetes, treated with statins for primary prevention during follow-up (Online 
Figures 1 and 2). Inclusion of death certificate data to help define fatal CHD may have led to 
some misclassification. Our study population may not be fully generalizable to all parts of 
the United States or to patients treated in different health care delivery systems; however, 
approximately one-third of the sample was obese, had known hypertension, and was a 
current or former smoker. In addition, unlike previous studies, we had a very ethnically 
diverse sample of patients with uniform access to care, as well as comprehensive 
ascertainment of clinically recognized ASCVD events, which argues for greater 
generalizability and validity. Given that most adults with diabetes within our health system 
were receiving statins for primary prevention, and were therefore not eligible for analysis, 
the sample we examined is not necessarily fully representative of all patients with diabetes. 
However, our study sample allowed comprehensive assessment of the observed 5-year 
ASCVD risk among adults with clinically recognized diabetes across the range of predicted 
risk, and we required all patients to have the full 5-year follow-up, which is critical to allow 
enough time to identify all fatal and nonfatal ASCVD events. We are unaware of any 
evidence that patients with symptoms or signs of possible ASCVD are more or less likely to 
remain insured and stay or leave our health system. There is a possibility that including 
those who died, but not those censored from disenrollment, could artificially raise the 
observed event rates, but given that the absolute risk of death was very low in this 
population, it is highly unlikely to have had a substantive impact on the results.
Insured patients may have better health habits than patients who are not able to afford 
insurance or choose not to obtain it. However, if one considers the rationale for risk 
assessment in the ACC/AHA guideline, this “real-world” population is more likely to 
represent typical patients in U.S. communities who are seeing a health care provider and 
who may be considered for preventive therapies, as compared with volunteers enrolled into 
prospective cohort studies or interventional clinical trials. Furthermore, if significant 
variation exists in regional population characteristics or outcomes, and if there are 
systematic differences in cardiovascular risk reduction efforts across health care settings, 
then it is critical that health care providers use a risk assessment tool that is calibrated to the 
patient population being seen by those providers.

 In sum, as recently recommended (27), we conducted a critical evaluation of the ASCVD 
Pooled Cohort risk equation from a relevant large, diverse, “real-world” target population, 
overall and in key understudied subgroups. We found that this risk equation substantially 
overestimated actual ASCVD risk in adults not treated with statin therapy for primary 
prevention without diabetes (overall and across all sociodemographic subgroups), and 
demonstrated suboptimal accuracy in those with or without diabetes. Our study provides 
evidence to support recalibration of the ASCVD Pooled Cohort risk equation in adults 
without diabetes, especially given the individual and public health implications of 
widespread application of this risk calculator. Ongoing research and dialogue in this area 
remains crucial, and should be encouraged in order to provide more rigorous, valid evidence 
in contemporary, diverse populations (26-28).

 Clinical Perspectives
Competency in Systems-Based Practice
The 2013 ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort risk equation estimates risk for both coronary events 
and stroke. However, the risk equation substantially overestimates ASCVD risk in adults 
without diabetes mellitus and has suboptimal accuracy across sociodemographic 
subgroups and also in adults with diabetes who do not receive statin therapy for primary 
prevention.
Translational Outlook
More research is needed to develop risk assessment tools that are calibrated to diverse, 
contemporary populations, especially given the implications of recommending lifelong 
statin therapy.
