Abstract
Oxytocin administration has been reported to decrease consumption, withdrawal, and drug-
seeking associated with several drugs of abuse and thus represents a promising pharmaco-
logical approach to treat drug addiction. We used an established rat model of alcohol depen-
dence to investigate oxytocin’s effects on dependence-induced alcohol drinking, enhanced
motivation for alcohol, and altered GABAergic transmission in the central nucleus of the
amygdala (CeA). Intraperitoneal oxytocin administration blocked escalated alcohol drinking
and the enhanced motivation for alcohol in alcohol-dependent but not nondependent rats.
Intranasal oxytocin delivery fully replicated these effects. Intraperitoneal administration had
minor but significant effects of reducing locomotion and intake of non-alcoholic palatable
solutions, whereas intranasal oxytocin administration did not. In dependent rats, intracereb-
roventricular administration of oxytocin or the oxytocin receptor agonist PF-06655075,
which does not cross the blood-brain barrier (i.e., it would not diffuse to the periphery), but
not systemic administration of PF-06655075 (i.e., it would not reach the brain), decreased
alcohol drinking. Administration of a peripherally restricted oxytocin receptor antagonist
did not reverse the effect of intranasal oxytocin on alcohol drinking. Ex vivo electrophysiolog-
ical recordings from CeA neurons indicated that oxytocin decreases evoked GABA trans-
mission in nondependent but not in dependent rats, whereas oxytocin decreased the
amplitude of spontaneous GABAergic responses in both groups. Oxytocin blocked the

 facilitatory effects of acute alcohol on GABA release in the CeA of dependent but not
nondependent rats. Together, these results provide converging evidence that oxytocin spe-
cifically and selectively blocks the enhanced motivation for alcohol drinking that develops in
alcohol dependence likely via a central mechanism that may result from altered oxytocin
effects on CeA GABA transmission in alcohol dependence. Neuroadaptations in endoge-
nous oxytocin signaling may provide a mechanism to further our understanding of alcohol
use disorder.
Author summary
Alcohol use disorder is characterized by a reduction in reward function and gain in stress
function. The neuropeptide oxytocin is involved in the regulation of both reward and
stress systems. We tested the hypothesis that oxytocin administration could normalize the
dysregulations that occur in alcohol dependence and thereby reduce alcohol drinking in
dependent rats. We demonstrated that oxytocin administered systemically, intranasally,
or into the brain blocked the enhanced drinking exhibited by alcohol-dependent rats.
These effects were demonstrated to be centrally rather than peripherally mediated. Oxyto-
cin blocked this enhanced alcohol drinking at doses that did not alter non–alcohol-related
behaviors or alcohol drinking in nondependent rats, suggesting the effect was specific to
alcohol drinking in alcohol dependence. Ex vivo electrophysiological recordings in the
central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA; a key brain region in the network of dysregulations
induced by alcohol dependence) indicated that oxytocin blocked the facilitatory effects of
alcohol on inhibitory signaling in dependent but not nondependent rats. These results
provide compelling evidence that dysregulation in the endogenous oxytocin system is of
functional relevance to a mechanistic understanding of alcohol use disorder.
Introduction
Alcohol use disorder is a global public health issue; 6% of the world’s population is subject to
morbidity and mortality from alcohol [1]. Alcohol dependence (reflecting dysfunction equiva-
lent to moderate to severe alcohol use disorder) is a chronic, relapsing disorder that develops
as a result of neuroadaptations in brain reward, stress, and executive function systems con-
trolled by neurocircuits that involve the basal ganglia, extended amygdala, and prefrontal cor-
tex, respectively [2]. In alcohol dependence, the motivation to seek and consume alcohol is
driven by reward hypofunction and stress sensitization. Both of these processes contribute to a
negative emotional state that drives enhanced motivation for alcohol drinking via negative
reinforcement [3,4].
Oxytocin has been hypothesized to have an important role in social behavior, fear and anxi-
ety, and learning and memory [5]. Recent optogenetic and neuroanatomical mapping studies
have advanced our understanding of the complexity of oxytocin’s neurocircuitry and the role
of signaling by the endogenous oxytocin system in various behaviors [6]. Oxytocin modulates
stress and reward function and has long been suggested as a putative treatment for addiction
[7]. Reports that oxytocin administration can reduce drug consumption, withdrawal, and
relapse associated with various drugs of abuse in preclinical models has greatly enhanced the
interest in this area [8,9]. Indeed, oxytocin decreased economic demand for stimulants [10],
reinstatement of stimulant seeking [11,12], opioid tolerance and withdrawal [13], and

 development of alcohol tolerance [7]. Particularly relevant for treating alcohol dependence,
oxytocin has an anti-stress and anti-anxiety profile [14]. Preliminary clinical studies have dem-
onstrated that intranasal oxytocin administration reduced alcohol-withdrawal–related anxiety
and alcohol craving in alcohol-dependent patients in early abstinence [15], reduced alcohol
craving in anxious alcohol-dependent individuals [16], and reduced neural response to alcohol
cues in heavy social drinkers [17]. Oxytocin decreased drinking in nondependent rats [18,19],
binge drinking in mice [20,21], and cue-induced reinstatement in postdependent rats [17].
However, oxytocin’s effects on alcohol drinking and motivation for alcohol in currently alco-
hol-dependent rats remains to be determined. Therefore, in the present study, we used a
model of chronic-intermittent exposure to alcohol vapor to induce alcohol dependence and
enhanced motivation for alcohol. This model has excellent predictive validity, has allowed dis-
sociation of the neurobiology underlying alcohol dependent versus nondependent behavior,
and has been used to determine the likely contribution of a range of neurobiological systems
to alcohol use disorder [3,39].
Oxytocin has been detected in the brain following both intraperitoneal and intranasal
administration in mice and rats [22–24]. Oxytocin receptors are found in the brain and in vari-
ous peripheral tissues, where binding mediates oxytocin’s classic role in lactation, parturition,
and sexual reflexes in males and females [25]. There are several other oxytocin binding sites in
the periphery, including the gut, heart, vascular system, and vagus nerve, which all may con-
tribute to behavioral effects of oxytocin, including inhibition of appetite and fear [25,26]. The
central versus peripheral contributions to oxytocin’s putative effects on alcohol drinking also
remain to be determined.
Oxytocin receptors are found in many brain regions relevant for alcohol dependence,
such as the extended amygdala in rats and humans, including the central nucleus of the
amygdala (CeA) [27,28]. The CeA is well described as a key structure involved in the transi-
tion to drug and alcohol dependence [2,29]. Silencing of an alcohol-withdrawal–activated
CeA neuronal ensemble blocked the enhanced drinking associated with alcohol dependence
[30]. The majority of CeA neurons are GABAergic, and increased GABA signaling in the
CeA is linked to alcohol dependence. Intra-CeA infusion of a GABAA receptor agonist
decreased alcohol drinking in alcohol-dependent rats [31]. We previously demonstrated that
spontaneous and evoked GABA transmission is increased in CeA of alcohol-dependent rats
[32]. Both pro- and anti-stress neuropeptides interact with CeA GABA signaling and bidirec-
tionally modulate alcohol drinking. Oxytocin has been reported to interact with GABAergic
signaling and may block the acute effects of alcohol via a direct action on GABAA receptors
[33]. However, the physiological effects of CeA oxytocin in alcohol dependence are currently
unknown.
Therefore, in the present study, we tested the hypothesis that oxytocin decreases alcohol
drinking and motivation for alcohol specifically in alcohol-dependent rats via central and not
peripheral actions. Furthermore, we hypothesized that alcohol dependence would alter how
oxytocin modulates GABA signaling in the CeA.

 Abuse Intramural Research Program. All electrophysiological procedures were approved by
the IACUC of The Scripps Research Institute. All procedures were conducted according to
the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (8th
edition).
Animals
Rats used in behavioral (male Wistar, n = 86; Charles River, Kingston, NY) and electrophysi-
ology (male Sprague-Dawley, n = 87; Charles River, Raleigh, NC) experiments weighed
225 to 275 g upon arrival, were group-housed (2 to 3 per cage) in standard plastic cages in
a temperature- and humidity-controlled room, and were maintained under a reverse 12 h/
12 h light/dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum except during behavioral
testing.
Drugs
For behavioral experiments, alcohol (ethanol; Warner Graham, Cockeysville, MD) was dis-
solved in tap water. Oxytocin (ChemPep Inc., Wellington, FL) was dissolved in 0.9% saline.
For peripheral administration, the non–blood-brain barrier-penetrant oxytocin receptor ago-
nist PF-06655075 was initially dissolved in 10% (v/v) Self Emulsifying Drug Delivery System
that consisted of 3:4:3 Miglyol 812:Cremophor RH40:Capmul MCM (v/v/v). The emulsion
was completed with 90% (v/v) 50 mM aqueous phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). For intracerebro-
ventricular administration, PF-06655075 was initially dissolved in 5% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide,
then combined with 5% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 300, and completed with 90% (v/v) saline.
PF-06655075 and the vehicle used for its peripheral administration were kindly provided by
Pfizer. The non–blood-brain barrier penetrant antagonist L-371,257 (Tocris Bioscience, Ellis-
ville, MO) was prepared in a vehicle of 5% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, 5% (v/v) Cremophor, and
90% (v/v) sterile water.
For electrophysiology experiments, oxytocin and the selective vasopressin receptor 1A
antagonist (d(CH2)5,Tyr(Me)2,Arg8)-Vasopressin (TMA) [34] were obtained from Tocris
(Ellisville, MO). The selective oxytocin receptor antagonist desGly-NH2-d(CH2)5[D-Tyr2,
Thr4]OVT (OTA) was provided by Dr. Maurice Manning (University of Toledo, OH) [34].
CGP 55845A, DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (DL-AP5), and 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-
2,3-dione (DNQX) were obtained from Tocris (Ellisville, MO). Tetrodotoxin (TTX) was pur-
chased from Biotium (Hayward, CA). Alcohol was purchased from Remet (La Mirada, CA,
USA). All drugs were dissolved in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF).
Operant alcohol self-administration and alcohol vapor exposure
Oral alcohol self-administration experiments were conducted in standard operant chambers
(Med Associates, St. Albans, VT) fitted with 2 retractable levers and a dual-cup liquid recep-
tacle. After initial training, as previously described [29,35], the animals were allowed to lever
press for alcohol (10%, w/v; 0.1 ml) and water (0.1 ml) on separate levers according to a
concurrent fixed-ratio 1 (FR1) schedule of reinforcement (each lever press resulted in fluid
delivery) in 30-min operant sessions. After each training session, the liquid receptacle and
surrounding area were inspected to confirm the consumption of earned reinforcers. After
response acquisition, rats were split into 2 groups matched by their alcohol consumption.
For the remainder of these experiments, rats in the nondependent group were exposed to air
without alcohol, whereas rats in the dependent group were exposed to alcohol vapor in daily
cycles designed to cause intoxication (14 h vapor “on”; 200 mg/dl target blood alcohol levels)

 and withdrawal (10 h vapor “off”) to induce alcohol dependence, as previously described
[29,35]. Dependence is characterized by somatic and motivational signs of withdrawal that
include increased anxiety-like behavior, reward deficits, and enhanced motivation to self-
administration of alcohol [36–39]. In all operant alcohol self-administration experiments,
steady baseline consumption of alcohol was established in dependent and nondependent rats
before pharmacological testing began. Operant alcohol self-administration sessions includ-
ing pharmacological tests were conducted 2 to 3 sessions per week (never on consecutive
days to minimize potential carry-over effects) during the 10 h “off” period, 6 to 8 h into
withdrawal.
Effect of intraperitoneal oxytocin on alcohol intake (FR1) and motivation
(progressive ratio)
Intraperitoneal oxytocin (0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/kg; 0.5 or 1 ml/kg) was administered 30
min prior to FR1 alcohol self-administration sessions in dependent (n = 10) and nondepen-
dent (n = 10) rats. The pretreatment time was selected based on previous work that determined
peak brain oxytocin concentrations following intraperitoneal oxytocin administration [22].
The test order of intraperitoneal doses was counterbalanced using a within-subjects Latin-
square design. Self-administration of alcohol and water was recorded during tests. Based on
results of the FR1 test, the 0, 0.125, and 0.25 mg/kg intraperitoneal doses were then tested on
a progressive ratio (PR) schedule of reinforcement, in which the number of lever presses
required to obtain the next alcohol reinforcer increased progressively, as follows: 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3,
4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 7, 9, 9, 11, 11, 13, 13, etc. The last completed ratio (breakpoint) was used as an indi-
cation of motivation for alcohol. During the PR test, only the alcohol lever was made available.
Sessions lasted 90 min or until 15 min had elapsed without a response. The pretreatment time
during the PR test was the same as for the FR1 test. Again, these doses were administered in a
Latin-square design, with intervening nontesting days.
Effect of intranasal oxytocin on alcohol intake (FR1) and motivation (PR)
To reestablish a stable baseline of intake, the same rats described above were moved to differ-
ent operant chambers with matching operant manipulanda and reinforcer receptacles. They
were allowed eight 30-min FR1 sessions to obtain alcohol and water (S1 Fig). Next, intranasal
oxytocin was administered 1 h prior to testing responding for alcohol on FR1 and PR sched-
ules of reinforcement (described above). The pretreatment time was selected based on previ-
ous work that determined peak brain oxytocin concentrations following intranasal oxytocin
administration [22]. Again, tests were conducted in Latin-square designs with intervening
nontesting days. For intranasal drug delivery, general anesthesia was rapidly induced by iso-
flurane (5% for 2 to 5 min), and then rats were immediately administered intranasal oxytocin
(0, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/kg/20 μl; based on the FR1 data, the intranasal doses of 0.5 and 1 mg/
kg/20 μl were selected for testing on the PR schedule) using the rat Precision Olfactory Device
(rPOD; Impel NeuroPharma, Seattle, WA) and allowed to recover before being returned to
their home cage.
Effect of systemic and intranasal oxytocin on locomotion, grooming, motor
coordination, and consumption of nonalcoholic palatable solutions
Based on the effects of oxytocin on alcohol drinking and the motivation for alcohol, we
selected the doses of intraperitoneal (0.25 mg/kg) and intranasal (1 mg/kg) oxytocin for fur-
ther behavioral testing. These doses by each route were the lowest dose by each route that

 significantly reduced alcohol drinking and the motivation for alcohol specifically in depen-
dent rats. The pretreatment times were the same as used for testing on alcohol self-
administration.
Behavioral tests were conducted in separate cohorts of rats to assess potential non–alcohol-
specific effects of oxytocin on locomotion and grooming in an open field (dependent, n = 6;
nondependent, n = 6) and motor coordination on a rotarod (dependent, n = 5; nondependent,
n = 7). Two blind observers scored any instances of grooming behavior according to previ-
ously published work. A single point was given for each instance of vibration of forepaws, face
washing, body grooming, body scratching, paw licking, head shaking, body shaking, and geni-
tal grooming, according to previously reported studies [40,41]. Points were totaled for each
animal to yield a grooming score.
In addition to alcohol’s pharmacological effect, alcohol contains calories and has a sweet-
taste component that contribute to the reinforcer efficacy of alcohol. To assess the potential
role of calories and sweet taste in the ability of intraperitoneal and intranasal oxytocin to
reduce alcohol consumption, we tested oxytocin on the consumption of a nonalcoholic caloric
reinforcer without a sweet taste (5% maltodextrin; n = 7) and on a nonalcoholic sweet solution
without caloric content (0.1% saccharin; n = 8; additional details provided in S1 Text).
Central versus peripheral mediation of oxytocin’s effect on alcohol intake
Three separate cohorts of alcohol-dependent rats were used (central oxytocin administration:
n = 6; peripheral oxytocin receptor agonist: n = 9; peripheral oxytocin receptor antagonist
combined with intranasal oxytocin administration: n = 12). A subset of the group used for test-
ing the peripheral oxytocin receptor antagonist combined with intranasal oxytocin administra-
tion was given 2 sessions in the absence of any treatment to reestablish a baseline and then
used to test the effect of central administration of the oxytocin receptor agonist PF-06655075
(central oxytocin receptor agonist: n = 7). The central oxytocin and PF-06655075 administra-
tion cohorts were surgically implanted with a guide cannula to allow intracerebroventricular
administration of these compounds.
The oxytocin receptor antagonist L-371,257, which does not cross the blood-brain barrier,
was tested in combination with intranasal oxytocin administration to test the ability of periph-
eral antagonism to reverse the ability of intranasal oxytocin to reduce alcohol drinking in
dependent rats. L-371,257 is a potent and competitive antagonist of the oxytocin receptor
(pA2 = 8.4) with high affinity at both the oxytocin receptor (Ki = 19 nM) and vasopressin V1a
receptor (Ki = 3.7 nM) [42]. The pretreatment time and dose (45 min; 5 mg/kg) were selected
to be in excess of doses that provided blockade of oxytocin-induced uterine contractions for at
least several hours following peripheral (intravenous or intraduodenal) administration in rats
[42]. Doses much lower than this in rats (0.5 mg/kg intraperitoneal) [43] and mice (300 μg/kg
intranasal) [44,45] have been demonstrated to provide behaviorally effective antagonism.
Additionally, in previous studies, comparable doses of L-371,257 versus oxytocin (0.5 mg/kg
versus 0.5 mg/kg intraperitoneal in rats [43]; 300 μg/kg versus 200 μg/kg intranasal in mice
[45]) were administered. Here, we administered 5 times the dose of the antagonist compared
to oxytocin (5 mg/kg versus 1 mg/kg) via a preferred route of peripheral absorption (intraperi-
toneal injection versus intranasal application [23]) to conservatively test for the ability of the
peripherally acting antagonist to alter the actions of intranasal oxytocin. Rats were tested in a
within-subjects Latin-square design with the following combinations of intraperitoneal and
intranasal treatments: intraperitoneal vehicle with intranasal vehicle, intraperitoneal vehicle
with intranasal oxytocin (1 mg/kg/20 μl), intraperitoneal L-371,257 (5 mg/kg/ml) with

 intranasal vehicle, and intraperitoneal L-371,257 (5 mg/kg/ml) with intranasal oxytocin (1 mg/
kg/20 μl). Operant training and induction of dependence were conducted, as described above.
To test the effect of central versus peripheral oxytocin receptor agonism on dependence-
induced alcohol drinking, we administered centrally or peripherally a long-acting, large mole-
cule that does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier (PF-06655075). For central administra-
tion, 7 rats were surgically implanted with a guide cannula to allow intracerebroventricular
administration of PF-06655075. These rats were previously used to test the peripheral oxytocin
receptor antagonist combined with intranasal oxytocin administration (data shown in Fig 3B).
The PF-06655075 dose of 30 μg was selected for intracerebroventricular administration to
match the highest dose of oxytocin administered by the same route, a dose that blocked drink-
ing in alcohol-dependent rats. For peripheral administration, the rats were administered 1 mg/
kg of PF-06655075 subcutaneously. This dose was selected taking into account the high plasma
protein binding of PF-06655075 (i.e., resulting in lower unbound concentrations than oxyto-
cin) as well as its oxytocin receptor binding Ki. Subcutaneous administration of 1 mg/kg of
PF-06655075 versus 1 mg/kg of oxytocin would be expected to produce comparable receptor
occupancy (94.2% versus 99.7% at Cmax; see S1 Text for calculations based on data of Modi
and colleagues [26]). Therefore, 1 mg/kg of subcutaneous PF-06655075 was expected to reca-
pitulate the putative peripheral binding of oxytocin. This hypothesis was based on the observa-
tion that lower doses of intraperitoneal oxytocin were sufficient to block drinking in alcohol-
dependent rats in the present study. Specifically, 0.25 mg/kg of intraperitoneal oxytocin
reduced alcohol drinking in dependent rats to a similar extent as 30 μg of intracerebroventri-
cular oxytocin. Finally, this systemic dose of 1 mg/kg PF-06655075 has been reported to reduce
fear behavior potentially via anti-sympathetic action in the periphery [26].
Electrophysiology
Dependent and nondependent rats were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane followed by rapid
decapitation and immediate removal of the brain into an ice-cold high-sucrose brain slice cut-
ting solution (sucrose 206 mM; KCl 2.5 mM; CaCl2 0.5 mM; MgCl2 7 mM; NaH2PO4 1.2
mM; NaHCO3 26 mM; glucose 5 mM; HEPES 5 mM [pH 7.4]). Coronal slices (300 to
400 μm) containing the CeA were continuously superfused (flow rate of 2 to 4 ml/min) with
95% O2/5% CO2 equilibrated aCSF of the following composition: NaCl 130 mM, KCl 3.5 mM,
NaH2PO4 1.25 mM, MgSO4�7H2O 1.5 mM, CaCl2 2.0 mM, NaHCO3 24 mM, and glucose 10
mM. Recordings were performed in neurons from the medial subdivision of the CeA. Each
experimental group contained neurons from a minimum of 3 rats. GABAergic activity was
pharmacologically isolated with DNQX, DL-AP5, and CGP. All drugs were applied by bath
superfusion.
We recorded with sharp micropipettes filled with 3M KCl and evoked GABAergic inhibi-
tory postsynaptic potentials (eIPSPs) by stimulating locally within the medial subdivision of
CeA through a bipolar electrode. Neurons were held near their resting membrane potential
(−82.4 ± 0.8 mV). We performed an input–output (I/O) protocol consisting of a range of 5
current stimulations, starting at the threshold current required to elicit an eIPSP, up to the
strength required to elicit the maximum subthreshold amplitude. The middle stimulus inten-
sity was used to monitor drug-induced changes throughout the duration of the experiment.
Paired-pulse ratio (PPR) was performed at the stimulus intensity giving approximately 50% of
the maximal amplitude determined in the I/O protocol.
Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings of GABAergic spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic
currents (sIPSCs) and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) were from visual-
ized CeA neurons clamped at −60 mV for the duration of the recordings. Patch pipettes (3 to 6

EGTA, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 2 Na-ATP, and 0.2 Na-GTP. In all experiments, cells with a series
resistance greater than 25 MΩ were excluded from analysis, and series resistance was continu-
ously monitored during gap-free recording with a 10-mV pulse. Cells in which series resistance
changed more than 25% during the course of the experiment were excluded from analysis. All
measures were performed prior to (baseline) and during drug application (details in S1 Text).
Statistical analysis
Results are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean. The level of significance was
established as p < 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed in Prism 6 (Graphpad Software,
Inc., La Jolla, CA). Behavioral data were analyzed with one-way (Dose, Session, or Treatment)
repeated-measures analysis of variance (R.M. ANOVA), two-way (Group × Dose) R.M.
ANOVA, or by paired-samples t test. The Holms-Sidak test was used for post hoc compari-

independent-samples t test, as appropriate.
Results
Effect of intraperitoneal oxytocin on alcohol intake (FR1) and motivation
(PR)
Passive exposure to alcohol vapor has been demonstrated to cause somatic signs of depen-
dence in alcohol withdrawal as well as a dysregulation of reward and stress systems. The cardi-
nal feature of the model is the increased consumption and motivation for alcohol exhibited by
alcohol-dependent rats when allowed to perform an operant response for access to alcohol [3].
Prior to pharmacological testing, alcohol-dependent rats exposed to chronic-intermittent alco-
hol vapor exhibited significantly enhanced consumption of alcohol in comparison to nonde-
pendent rats that were exposed to air in their home cage throughout the study (S1 Fig).
Oxytocin abolished the difference in alcohol drinking between dependent and nondepen-
dent rats at doses of � 0.25 mg/kg (Fig 1). A 2 × 5 (Group × Dose) R.M. ANOVA yielded a sig-
nificant Group × Dose interaction (F4, 72 = 7.98, p < 0.0001). Post hoc analyses indicated that
dependent rats self-administered significantly more alcohol than the nondependent rats fol-
lowing 0 (p < 0.0001) and 0.125 mg/kg (p < 0.001) oxytocin doses, but this difference disap-
peared at higher doses. Responding was significantly lowered at the 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/kg
doses (all p < 0.0001) in dependent rats compared with the vehicle condition, whereas only
the highest dose of 1 mg/kg significantly lowered lever pressing for alcohol in nondependent
rats (p < 0.05). Water intake data during all tests are presented in S2 Fig.
Oxytocin (0.125 or 0.25 mg/kg) selectively eliminated the increased motivation for alcohol
in dependent rats (Fig 1B). A 2 × 3 (Group × Dose) R.M. ANOVA yielded a significant
Group × Dose interaction (F2, 36 = 3.59, p < 0.05). The difference in PR breakpoint between
groups following vehicle treatment was significant (p < 0.05). When treated with either 0.125
or 0.25 mg/kg doses of oxytocin, dependent rats no longer differed from nondependent rats.
Oxytocin (0.125 and 0.25 mg/kg) significantly reduced PR breakpoint for alcohol in dependent
rats (all p < 0.01), whereas responding in the nondependent group was not altered by oxytocin.
Effect of intranasal oxytocin on alcohol intake (FR1) and motivation (PR)
Intranasal oxytocin dose-dependently decreased alcohol drinking in dependent rats without
affecting drinking in nondependent rats (Fig 1C). The 2 × 4 (Group × Dose) R.M. ANOVA

 yielded a significant Group × Dose interaction (F3, 54 = 14.18, p < 0.0001). Dependent rats
drank more alcohol than nondependent rats treated with saline, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/kg oxytocin
(all p < 0.001). This difference was no longer observed following treatment with 1 mg/kg oxy-
tocin. Alcohol drinking in dependent rats significantly decreased across the doses of oxytocin
compared to the saline condition (all p < 0.0001), whereas drinking in the nondependent
group was not significantly altered by oxytocin.
On the PR test (Fig 1D), two-way R.M. ANOVA yielded a significant Group × Dose interac-
tion (F2, 36 = 4.27, p < 0.05). Following saline treatment, dependent rats had a significantly
higher breakpoint for alcohol than nondependent rats (t54 = 4.50, p < 0.001). This difference
was no longer observed following 0.5 or 1 mg/kg oxytocin administration. Oxytocin (1 mg/kg)

 reduced PR breakpoint in the dependent group (p < 0.001) without altering the behavior of
nondependent rats.
Effect of intraperitoneal and intranasal oxytocin on locomotion, grooming,
rotarod motor coordination, and consumption of nonalcoholic palatable
solutions
Dependent and nondependent rats were not significantly different in their spontaneous loco-
motion or grooming behavior. Intraperitoneal oxytocin (0.25 mg/kg) significantly decreased
locomotion in both dependent and nondependent rats (Fig 2A; Dose: F1, 10 = 14.63, p < 0.01;
post hoc tests all p < 0.05), whereas intranasal oxytocin (1 mg/kg) had no effect in either
group. Intraperitoneal and intranasal oxytocin treatments did not affect grooming behavior
(which remained minimal throughout testing; Fig 2A inset). Dependent and nondependent
rats did not significantly differ in their rotarod performance, and this performance was not sig-
nificantly altered by intraperitoneal or intranasal oxytocin treatments (Fig 2B). Intraperitoneal
oxytocin reduced saccharin (t6 = 2.80, p < 0.05) and maltodextrin (t6 = 3.20, p < 0.05) con-
sumption, whereas intranasal oxytocin had no effect (Fig 2C).
Central versus peripheral effect of oxytocin on alcohol intake
Baseline sessions conducted between intracerebroventricular oxytocin test sessions did not
significantly differ, so they were combined for analysis (Fig 3A). All doses of intracerebroven-
tricular oxytocin reduced alcohol consumption in dependent rats (Dose: F3, 15 = 10.25,
p < 0.001; post hoc tests: all p < 0.05).
Intranasal oxytocin treatment significantly reduced drinking in dependent rats whether the
rats were pretreated with either vehicle (VEH + VEH versus VEH + OXT) or with the periph-
erally restricted oxytocin receptor antagonist L-371,257 (L-371,257 + VEH versus L-371,257
+ OXT; Treatment: F3, 33 = 10.73, p < 0.0001; post hoc tests: all p < 0.05). L-371,257 did not
significantly alter drinking by itself (VEH + VEH versus L-371,257 + VEH) nor did it reverse
the ability of intranasal oxytocin to reduce alcohol drinking in dependent rats (VEH + OXT
versus L-371,257 + OXT; Fig 3B).
Baseline sessions conducted between test sessions with intracerebroventricular administra-
tion of PF-06655075 did not significantly differ and thus were combined for analysis (Fig 3C).
Intracerebroventricular administration of PF-06655075, which does not cross the blood-brain
barrier and thus was expected to not diffuse to the periphery, significantly reduced responding
for alcohol relative to baseline responding and relative to vehicle (Treatment: F2, 12 = 42.25,
p < 0.0001; post hoc tests: all p < 0.0001). Vehicle administration did not significantly alter
responding relative to baseline (Fig 3C). Systemic administration of PF-06655075 (expected
to not reach the brain) did not significantly alter responding for alcohol relative to baseline
responding or the vehicle condition nor did the vehicle itself significantly alter responding rel-
ative to baseline (Fig 3D).
Oxytocin decreases evoked CeA GABAergic signaling in nondependent but
not dependent rats
We recorded from neurons in the medial subdivision of the CeA, using sharp intracellular
whole cell configuration for locally evoked inhibitory GABAergic eIPSP and whole-cell patch-
clamp configuration for GABAergic postsynaptic currents. We found no difference in input
resistance of neurons from nondependent (154.4 ± 11.4 MΩ) and dependent (159.7 ± 7.6 MΩ)
rats and no difference in spike frequency (S3 Fig) between groups. Baseline GABAergic

 eIPSP amplitudes stimulated locally within the medial subdivision of CeA were not different
between nondependent (9.7 ± 0.7 mV) and dependent (9.9 ± 0.7 mV) animals (S4 Fig). No dif-
ferences were observed in PPR of eIPSPs at 100 ms interstimulus interval in nondependent
(1.06 ± 0.08) and dependent (1.01 ± 0.09) neurons.

 In CeA neurons of nondependent rats, 100 nM oxytocin (10 to 15 min) did not alter eIPSP
amplitudes, whereas 500 nM and 1,000 nM significantly decreased amplitudes to 83.4% ±
4.9% (t10 = 3.40, p < 0.01) and 74.1% ± 7.7% (t4 = 3.37, p < 0.05) of baseline, respectively
(Fig 4B). Notably, in dependent rats, oxytocin at all 3 concentrations did not affect eIPSPs. A
two-way ANOVA (Group × Concentration) yielded a significant Group effect (F1,44 = 4.55,
p < 0.05). Oxytocin did not alter input resistance of nondependent (baseline: 144.3 ± 13.8
MΩ, oxytocin: 148.3 ± 13.7 MΩ) or dependent (baseline: 148.2 ± 10.6 MΩ, oxytocin:
141.8 ± 12.9 MΩ) CeA neurons, suggesting that oxytocin effects on eIPSP amplitudes were
not due to excitability changes but due to decreased GABAergic transmission. Oxytocin
(500 nM) significantly increased the PPR of eIPSPs (baseline PPR: 0.98 ± 0.11; oxytocin PPR:
1.35 ± 0.14; t10 = 2.56, p < 0.05) in nondependent rats, suggesting a possible decrease in the
presynaptic release of GABA (as changes in PPR are inversely related to changes in release)
[46]. Oxytocin did not alter PPR in dependent rats (baseline PPR: 1.17 ± 0.22, oxytocin PPR:
1.03 ± 0.07).

 Alcohol increases evoked CeA GABAergic transmission
Acute alcohol (44 mM; maximal dose [47]) application significantly increased eIPSP ampli-
tudes in CeA of both nondependent (to 140.8% ± 8.5% of baseline; t7 = 4.79, p < 0.01) and
dependent rats (to 133.9% ± 13.4% of baseline; t6 = 2.53, p < 0.05; Fig 4C), indicating a lack of
tolerance for the acute effects of alcohol on stimulated GABAergic signaling, as previously
reported [47]. Additionally, alcohol did not alter input resistance of nondependent (baseline:
169.0 ± 19.2 MΩ, alcohol: 167.6 ± 15.8 MΩ) or dependent (baseline: 167.6 ± 10.4 MΩ, alcohol:
161.4 ± 11.4 MΩ) neurons. Because oxytocin also binds to vasopressin receptors and there is a
CeA subpopulation of neurons sensitive to vasopressin binding (specifically, via the V1a but
not V1b vasopressin receptor), we always preapplied the selective vasopressin receptor 1A
antagonist TMA (500 nM) to isolate specific oxytocin receptor-mediated actions [34,48]. TMA
had no effect on eIPSP amplitudes (nondependent: 8.51 ± 1.08 mV and dependent: 9.68 ± 1.31
mV without TMA) and did not affect the magnitude of the alcohol-induced increase of eIPSPs
in both nondependent (to 148.6% ± 10.5% of baseline; t5 = 4.64, p < 0.01) and dependent rats
(129.8% ± 10.6% of baseline; t6 = 2.80, p < 0.05; S5 Fig).
To determine potential interactions between oxytocin and acute alcohol, in most of the
neurons that received 500 nM oxytocin, we applied alcohol in the presence of oxytocin. In this
subset of neurons (7 of 9) from nondependent slices, coapplication of alcohol only induced a
moderate, nonsignificant increase of eIPSP amplitudes (oxytocin: 83.4% ± 4.9%; oxytocin
+ alcohol: 101.7% ± 8.3% of baseline; Fig 4C). In the subset of neurons (12 of 15) from depen-
dent slices, alcohol did not further increase eIPSPs (oxytocin: 107.6% ± 9.3%; oxytocin + alco-
hol: 123.0% ± 16.8% of baseline; Fig 4C), suggesting a blockade of oxytocin-induced decreased
GABA transmission in dependent rats. A two-way ANOVA (Group × Treatment) yielded a
significant main effect of Treatment (F2,53 = 6.33, p < 0.01), and a Bonferroni post hoc test
indicated a significant difference between the effects of alcohol and oxytocin (t53 = 3.35,
p < 0.01). Similarly, oxytocin at 100 and 1,000 nM blunted the alcohol-induced facilitation of
eIPSPs in both nondependent (84.2% ± 11.0% and 82.1% ± 13.2% of baseline, respectively)
and dependent slices (124.0% ± 18.6% and 125.5% ± 15.3% of baseline, respectively). Overall,
oxytocin blunted the alcohol-induced increase of GABA transmission (see Fig 4C).
Oxytocin decreases CeA GABAA receptor function
To further investigate the pre- versus postsynaptic action of oxytocin on GABA signaling, we
performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of sIPSCs and mIPSCs in CeA neurons. Gener-
ally, changes in IPSC frequency reflect altered transmitter release, and changes in amplitude or
kinetics reflect alterations in postsynaptic GABAA receptor sensitivity. However, altered
amplitude may also reflect a mix of pre- and postsynaptic effects [49,50].
We first investigated sIPSCs, finding no significant differences between nondependent and
dependent rats in sIPSC frequency (1.1 ± 0.2 and 0.8 ± 0.1 Hz, respectively), amplitude
(82.0 ± 8.4 and 66.6 ± 5.8 pA, respectively), rise time (2.6 ± 0.1 and 2.8 ± 0.1 ms, respectively),
or decay time (8.0 ± 0.8 and 9.4 ± 1.0 ms, respectively). We next used the vasopressin receptor
1A antagonist TMA and found no effects of TMA alone in either nondependent or dependent
rats (S6 Fig), as observed for evoked GABAergic responses. In CeA neurons of nondependent
rats, application of 500 nM oxytocin significantly decreased the amplitude of sIPSCs to 85.2%
± 6.7% of baseline (t11 = 2.22, p < 0.05) and increased rise times to 110.5% ± 4.7% of baseline
(t11 = 2.24, p < 0.05) with no changes in frequency or decay times (Fig 5A), indicating mainly
postsynaptic actions of oxytocin to decrease GABAA receptor function. In dependent rats (Fig
5A), oxytocin also significantly decreased sIPSC amplitude to 83.1% ± 5.0% of baseline (t8 =
3.37, p < 0.01), with no changes in sIPSC frequency or kinetics.

 We next investigated mIPSCs in the presence of the sodium channel blocker TTX to isolate
action potential independent currents. Generally, mIPSC analysis reveals specific effects of
drugs on vesicular release of GABA, which results from exocytosis of neurotransmitter con-
taining vesicles in a manner independent of action-potential–induced release mechanisms. In
addition, sIPSCs and mIPSCs likely result from distinct presynaptic neurotransmitter release
mechanisms, e.g., vesicle fusion machinery, spatial segregation of the vesicles and/or vesicle
populations, and synaptic vesicle pool dynamics [51]. Similar to sIPSCs, we did not find any
baseline differences between nondependent and dependent rats in mIPSC frequency (0.8 ± 0.1
and 0.9 ± 0.3 Hz, respectively), amplitude (53.2 ± 4.0 and 60.7 ± 12.3 pA, respectively), rise
time (2.5 ± 0.1 and 2.5 ± 0.1 ms, respectively), or decay time (5.5 ± 0.6 and 6.2 ± 0.8 ms, respec-
tively). Oxytocin did not alter mIPSC frequency, amplitude, or kinetics for neurons from non-
dependent or dependent rats (Fig 5B), suggesting no effect of oxytocin on this form of GABA
release in the medial subdivision of CeA.
Oxytocin blocks alcohol’s effects on GABA release in dependent rats
We next examined the interaction of oxytocin and acute alcohol on CeA sIPSCs in nondepen-
dent and dependent rats. In 8 of the 12 CeA neurons from nondependent rats that received
500 nM oxytocin, and 7 of the 9 neurons from dependent rats, we coapplied alcohol (44 mM)
and compared effects between groups on sIPSC measures (Fig 5D–5G). A two-way ANOVA
(Group × Treatment) yielded a significant effect of Treatment (F1,13 = 4.87, p < 0.05) and a
Group × Treatment interaction (F1,13 = 9.84, p < 0.01) for sIPSC frequency (Fig 5D). The Bon-
ferroni post hoc comparisons indicated that alcohol with oxytocin significantly increased
sIPSC frequency compared with oxytocin alone in nondependent rats (t13 = 3.91, p < 0.01).
Therefore, oxytocin blocked the alcohol-induced increase in GABA release only in CeA neu-
rons of alcohol-dependent rats. Additionally, a two-way ANOVA (Group × Treatment)
yielded a significant Group × Treatment interaction (F1,13 = 20.88, p < 0.001) for sIPSC decay
time (Fig 5G). The Bonferroni post hoc comparisons indicated that alcohol with oxytocin sig-
nificantly increased decay times compared with oxytocin alone in nondependent rats (t13 =
4.86, p < 0.001).

 As previously shown [52], we found that in nondependent and dependent rats, acute alco-
hol alone significantly increased sIPSC frequency to 145.5% ± 13.4% of baseline (t5 = 3.40,
p < 0.05) and 131.4% ± 8.6% of baseline (t9 = 3.65, p < 0.01), respectively (Fig 5H), with no
changes in sIPSC amplitude or kinetics, suggesting increased action-potential–dependent
GABA release. We compared the effects of alcohol alone with the effects of alcohol and oxyto-
cin using two-way ANOVAs (Group × Treatment) for each sIPSC measure (Fig 5H–5K).
We found a significant main effect of Treatment (F1,27 = 9.00, p < 0.01) and a significant
Group × Treatment interaction (F1,27 = 5.61, p < 0.05) for sIPSC rise times (Fig 5J). The Bon-
ferroni post hoc comparisons indicated a significant difference in the effects of alcohol with
oxytocin versus alcohol alone for nondependent neurons.
Finally, we found that the selective oxytocin receptor antagonist desGly-NH2-d(CH2)5
[D-Tyr2,Thr4]OVT alone did not alter sIPSCs (S7 Fig), suggesting no basal activity of these
receptors on spontaneous GABAergic transmission in dependent rats. Notably, in neurons
from dependent rats, oxytocin in the presence of OTA had no effect on sIPSCs when com-
pared to baseline (Fig 5L and 5M). In a subset of these neurons (8 out of 11), we applied alco-
hol in the presence of both OTA and oxytocin, resulting in a significant increase in sIPSC
frequency (t7 = 3.01, p < 0.05; Fig 5M). We found a similar effect of OTA to rescue the alcohol
effect on eIPSPs from nondependent neurons (t7 = 2.70, p < 0.05; S8 Fig). These results con-
firm that oxytocin receptor antagonism blocked postsynaptic effects of oxytocin and restored
the acute alcohol-induced facilitation of GABA release in the CeA of alcohol-dependent rats.
Discussion
Oxytocin delivered via intraperitoneal, intranasal, and intracerebroventricular routes blocked
the enhanced motivation for alcohol drinking that developed in alcohol-dependent rats. Intra-
peritoneal and intranasal oxytocin at certain doses blocked the increased alcohol consumption
and motivation for alcohol in dependent rats, without impacting these behaviors in nondepen-
dent rats. Intranasal oxytocin did not disrupt spontaneous locomotion, grooming behavior,
motor coordination, or consumption of sweet or caloric palatable solutions. Central adminis-
tration of oxytocin produced a dose-dependent reduction in alcohol drinking in dependent
rats, and this effect was replicated by central administration of an oxytocin receptor agonist
(PF-06655075) that does not cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore was expected to not
diffuse to the periphery. However, peripheral administration of PF-06655075 (expected to not
reach the brain) had no effect. Additionally, peripheral administration of an oxytocin receptor
antagonist that does not cross the blood-brain barrier did not reverse the ability of intranasal
oxytocin to reduce alcohol drinking in dependent rats. Together, the data suggest a central
mechanism for oxytocin’s actions on alcohol drinking. Ex vivo electrophysiology recordings
indicated that oxytocin inhibits spontaneous action-potential–dependent GABAergic trans-
mission in CeA slices from both dependent and nondependent rats. However, oxytocin’s abil-
ity to dose-dependently reduce evoked network GABAergic activity was absent in slices from
dependent rats. Furthermore, oxytocin blunted acute alcohol-induced facilitation of evoked
GABAergic responses in both nondependent and dependent rats but blocked alcohol-induced
facilitation of spontaneous action-potential–dependent GABA release only in CeA slices from
alcohol-dependent rats, suggesting differential GABA network effects in nondependent and
dependent rats produced by oxytocin.
Systemic oxytocin blocked the enhanced motivation for alcohol observed in dependent
rats, indexed by escalated alcohol drinking and increased breakpoint in a PR test, at doses that
did not change the behavior of nondependent rats. These findings are consistent with previous
reports that oxytocin can decrease alcohol drinking in nondependent mice and rats [20,21]

 and that oxytocin is particularly effective in decreasing cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol
seeking in postdependent rats compared with nondependent rats [17]. The present findings
are unique in several ways from previous work in rats [17]. They demonstrate the following:
(1) Oxytocin can reduce alcohol drinking and the enhanced motivation to “work” for alcohol
in currently alcohol-dependent rats. This difference is critical, because it provides a novel indi-
cation for oxytocin’s potential therapeutic value. Alcohol drinking during acute (i.e., currently
alcohol-dependent rats) and protracted abstinence (i.e., alcohol seeking in rats with a history
of alcohol dependence) are proposed to model distinct phases and aspects of alcohol use disor-
der, with distinct underlying neurocircuitry [2]. The results of the present study indicate that
oxytocin may have the potential to reduce heavy drinking in moderate to severe alcohol use
disorder. (2) Oxytocin’s anti-drinking effects in rats can be achieved by intranasal administra-
tion, using a device designed to allow noninvasive drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier
[53]. (3) Intranasal administration reduced alcohol consumption and motivation for alcohol
in dependent rats without causing nonspecific locomotor, grooming, motor coordination, and
consumption of nonalcoholic sweet or caloric palatable solutions, suggesting that oxytocin’s
effects on alcohol drinking are specific to the pharmacological effects of alcohol. (4) The pres-
ent study provides evidence that peripheral receptors did not make a major contribution to the
effect of intranasal oxytocin. More specifically, intracerebroventricular administration of a
large molecule (PF-06655075) that does not cross the blood-brain barrier or intracerebroven-
tricular administration of oxytocin significantly reduced alcohol drinking in dependent rats.
However, PF-06655075 administered systemically at a dose matching the highest tested dose
of systemic oxytocin (4 times the dose sufficient to block drinking in alcohol-dependent rats)
did not have an effect. Therefore, oxytocin’s effect of reducing alcohol drinking in the present
model of alcohol dependence is likely centrally mediated. Further supporting this hypothesis,
application of the nonbrain penetrant antagonist L-371,257 did not reverse the ability of intra-
nasal oxytocin to reduce alcohol drinking in alcohol-dependent rats, suggesting that intranasal
administration of oxytocin reduces alcohol drinking in dependent rats independent of oxyto-
cin receptor binding in the periphery.
Despite the precise mechanism remaining unknown, there is accumulating evidence that
peripherally applied oxytocin can cross the blood-brain barrier in adult rodents. As suggested
by others [22,23], there is likely a mechanism for direct transport of intranasally applied oxyto-
cin across the blood-brain barrier in adult rodents. Tanaka and colleagues applied oxytocin by
intravenous, intraperitoneal, and intranasal routes in rats to determine the peripheral and cen-
tral levels of oxytocin resulting from each route of administration [23]. The authors used the
intraperitoneal administration data to determine the amount of centrally detected oxytocin
that can be expected to result from peripherally circulating levels. They used this information
to account for centrally detected oxytocin following intranasal administration that may be the
result of oxytocin transferring first from the nasal epithelium into the peripheral circulation,
then into the brain. It was concluded that, under the conditions of intranasal administration,
>95% of the oxytocin detected in the brain is expected to result from direct transport across
the blood-brain barrier [22,23]. Indeed, oxytocin detected in the brain was higher following
intranasal administration compared with intravenous or intraperitoneal administration,
despite intranasal administration resulting in far lower oxytocin plasma concentrations. Fur-
thermore, oxytocin concentrations were especially high in the olfactory bulb after intranasal
administration, suggesting a direct route of entry [23]. Bustion and colleagues demonstrated
that radio-labeled oxytocin administered in mice intranasally was detected throughout the
brain, i.e., dissociating exogenously applied deuterated oxytocin from endogenous oxytocin,
thus confirming direct entry [24]. Again, particularly elevated levels were detected in the olfac-
tory bulb, suggesting a point of entry at the nasal epithelium.

 Although intraperitoneal oxytocin administration decreased locomotion in the open field
and the consumption of a nonalcoholic, noncaloric sweet solution and a nonalcoholic,
unsweetened caloric solution, intranasal administration did not. Neither intraperitoneal nor
intranasal oxytocin administration altered grooming behavior in the open field or perfor-
mance in the rotarod task, indicating that the intraperitoneal effect on locomotion is likely not
a result of altered motor coordination. A possible explanation for nonspecific effects of intra-
peritoneal oxytocin administration is that that oxytocin may have “side effects” that result
from binding at peripheral sites (e.g., gut, heart, vascular system, and/or vagus nerve) that dis-
rupt behavior in general and that were induced following intraperitoneal oxytocin administra-
tion in the present study. Congruent with this account is the observation that intraperitoneal
oxytocin suppressed water consumption during tests for oxytocin’s effect on alcohol consump-
tion. In contrast, oxytocin treatment did not alter water consumption when administered
intranasally, intracerebroventricularly, or intranasally in combination with L-371,257, suggest-
ing that peripheral “side effects” were avoided during these tests (S2 Fig). Intraperitoneal
administration of oxytocin, unlike the peripherally restricted agonist PF-06655075, was able
to block alcohol drinking in dependent rats, similarly to intranasal oxytocin administration.
Although the transfer of peripherally circulating oxytocin to the central compartment is
expected to be very limited, a rapid, dramatic spike in plasma-oxytocin concentrations has
been noted following intraperitoneal administration that may allow pharmacologically rele-
vant central concentrations of oxytocin to be achieved, especially following application of
supraphysiological oxytocin doses, as used in the present study [18,20,22,23,54]. A recent
study found deuterated oxytocin administered intravenously was detected centrally in rhesus
macaques (i.e., dissociating exogenous labeled oxytocin from endogenous oxytocin, confirm-
ing direct transfer [55]). Although intraperitoneal administration of oxytocin induced some
side effects in the present study, the action of intraperitoneal oxytocin that causes reduction of
alcohol drinking in dependent rats is likely the same central mechanism as engaged following
intranasal administration. Nevertheless, the present data suggest that administration by intra-
nasal compared with intraperitoneal route may result in more favorable pharmacokinetics for
achieving central over peripheral oxytocin exposure [22,23].
To further test the hypothesis of central oxytocin action, we demonstrated that intracereb-
roventricular infusion of oxytocin and PF-06655075 (expected to not diffuse to the periphery)
reduced alcohol drinking in dependent rats. Systemic administration of PF-06655075
(expected to not to cross the blood-brain barrier) did not affect alcohol intake in dependent
rats. Finally, the peripherally restricted oxytocin receptor antagonist L-371,257 did not alter
the effects of intranasal oxytocin in reducing alcohol drinking in dependent rats. Together,
these data suggest that peripheral receptors make a minimal contribution to intranasal oxyto-
cin’s effects on alcohol drinking.
Next, we examined the effects of oxytocin on GABAergic transmission in the CeA, a key
brain region of dysregulation in alcohol dependence [3,56–59]. To gain mechanistic insight
into the contribution of the oxytocin system on CeA GABAergic transmission in the context
of acute and chronic alcohol, here, we examined both spontaneous action-potential–depen-
dent and evoked GABAergic transmission wherein the network activity is intact, as well as
action-potential–independent transmission. We found that oxytocin decreases GABA sig-
naling in the CeA of both dependent and nondependent rats, but its effects varied between
different modes of GABAergic transmission. In alcohol-nondependent rats, oxytocin
decreased evoked GABA responses by decreasing evoked GABA release, an effect that is no
longer observed in dependent rats, suggesting neuroadaptations of the CeA oxytocin system
in dependence. In contrast, oxytocin decreased GABAA receptor function in both nondepen-
dent and dependent rats. Similar to previous studies in the medial subdivision of CeA [48],

 oxytocin did not affect action-potential–independent GABAergic transmission in either
group. Evoked GABA responses are generated by delivering a controlled electrical stimula-
tion locally within the CeA, whereas spontaneous events reflect inhibitory signaling across
the broader CeA synaptic network. Miniature currents result from spontaneous presynaptic
vesicle fusion independent of sodium entry and more precisely determine pre- and postsyn-
aptic drug effects occurring at the terminals. In addition, spontaneous and evoked forms of
GABA transmission may represent distinct forms of GABA transmission, resulting from dis-
tinct presynaptic neurotransmitter release mechanisms (e.g., vesicle fusion machinery, spa-
tial segregation of the vesicles and/or vesicle populations, synaptic vesicle pool dynamics)
[51]. Of note, oxytocin had no effect on mIPSCs or cellular excitability, therefore its effects
on sIPSC amplitude and rise time, as well as in eIPSP amplitude and PPR, suggest synaptic
effects rather than cell excitability. These synaptic effects likely occur upstream within the
local intact GABAergic network that is shared by spontaneous and evoked forms of synaptic
transmission, whereas miniature effects are more localized to the specific terminals in the
medial subdivision of the CeA where oxytocin receptors may not be present [48]. These con-
siderations are critical and need to be taken into account when comparing with oxytocin
electrophysiological effects reported on by others in the lateral subdivision of the CeA
[48,60,61]. In contrast, these lateral CeA studies reported effects of oxytocin in increasing
excitability of lateral CeA GABAergic neurons that project to the medial CeA, resulting in
an increase in sIPSC frequency and decreased excitability in the medial CeA [48]. Although
the lack of oxytocin effect on mIPSCs in the medial CeA is consistent with our results, we
observed that oxytocin decreased GABAergic transmission in the medial CeA without
changing cellular excitability. There are two likely reasons for these discrepancies. The first is
the use of the native peptide oxytocin in our studies as opposed to the selective peptide oxy-
tocin-receptor agonist (Thr⁴,Gly⁷)-Oxytocin (TGOT) [34]. Although we pharmacologically
block the predominant vasopressin receptor in the CeA, native versus selective peptide ago-
nists for the oxytocin receptor may exhibit functional selectivity at the oxytocin receptor
or off-target effects. The second possibility is the heterogeneity and interconnectivity of
GABAergic neurons in the CeA. The medial CeA contains GABAergic neurons that project
out of the CeA as well as synapse locally. In one previous study [48] of the TGOT responsive
cells, only about half of the TGOT inhibited neurons were excited by vasopressin. Addition-
ally, Viviani and colleagues reported that projection-specific populations of medial CeA
GABAergic neurons were unresponsive to TGOT [60]. Therefore, it is possible that the
majority of the neurons from which we recorded were from a subpopulation of GABA neu-
rons that did not receive direct innervation of oxytocin-excited lateral CeA GABAergic neu-
rons. Additionally, from our evoked experiments, the electrical stimulation likely excited
neurons in the lateral and medial CeA, and our responses were a composite of these effects.
Therefore, future experiments will determine specific cell types to understand the distinct
oxytocin effects on the different components of the synaptic network.
Understanding the physiological actions of oxytocin in the CeA may benefit by compari-
son to the pro-stress, pro-drinking effects of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and the
anti-stress, anti-drinking effects of neuropeptide Y (NPY). The pro-stress neuropeptide CRF
is elevated in the CeA, likely mediated by glucocorticoid receptors [62,63] in alcohol depen-
dence, and infusion of CRF1 or glucocorticoid receptor antagonists in the CeA suppress
drinking specifically in alcohol-dependent rats [38,62,64–66]. In contrast, the anti-stress
neuropeptide NPY is decreased in the CeA in alcohol dependence, and intra-CeA infusion of
NPY suppresses alcohol drinking specifically in dependent rats [67,68]. We have reported
that CRF, similar to alcohol, robustly enhances GABAergic transmission in CeA of rats
[38,66,68]. However, NPY and nociceptin decreased presynaptic GABA release in CeA,

 normalizing the enhanced GABAergic transmission observed in alcohol dependence [68].
Both NPY and nociceptin also block the presynaptic acute alcohol-induced facilitation of
CeA GABA release, whereas oxytocin blocked GABA release in dependent rats only. We pre-
viously reported that alcohol may act presynaptically through voltage-gated calcium chan-
nels to increase action-potential–dependent GABA release in the CeA and that alcohol
dependence disrupts this mechanism, shifting alcohol actions to CRF1 receptors [52]. This
may explain why oxytocin has no effect on eIPSPs in dependent animals if alcohol depen-
dence dysregulates calcium channels and oxytocin effects work through action-potential–
induced calcium-dependent mechanisms. Additionally, oxytocin, via action at oxytocin
receptors, may interfere with the CRF1 receptor-mediated mechanism in dependent rats to
blunt the effects of alcohol. Therefore, oxytocin’s actions in the CeA are similar but not iden-
tical to anti-stress neuropeptides like NPY [67]. Oxytocin’s actions are particularly complex
given the pre- and postsynaptic interactions with alcohol. Future studies will be needed to
investigate the functional role of oxytocin in its interactions with other pro-stress and anti-
stress systems in the CeA.
One important limitation of the present work is that the studies were conducted exclusively
in male rats, especially considering sex-specific oxytocin distribution and behavioral media-
tion [69,70] and sex differences in alcohol drinking [35,71]. It will be critical to test the effect
of oxytocin in female subjects to determine the extent to which the present conclusions can be
generalized to females. Second, the behavior and electrophysiology experiments were per-
formed in Wistar and Sprague Dawley rats, respectively. Note that, in general, we find the dif-
ferent rat strains to be better suited to one set of experiments or the other (Wistar for behavior
and Sprague-Dawley for electrophysiology). There may be strain differences in the sensitivity
of rats to oxytocin treatment (e.g., MacFadyen and colleagues reported that 0.1 mg/kg oxytocin
reduced drinking in nondependent Sprague-Dawley rats [18]). However, we included internal
controls in behavioral and electrophysiological experiments and have previously shown that
baseline CeA synaptic activity and effects of drugs are similar between these strains [72]. As
such, we do not find problems conceptually linking the data sets. Lastly, although we tested
the oxytocin effects on CeA GABAergic signaling in the presence of a V1a antagonist to rule
out the contribution of CeA vasopressin receptors in oxytocin’s effects on CeA GABAergic sig-
naling, the contribution of vasopressin receptors to the observed behavioral effects were not
evaluated in the present study. There is evidence suggesting a role of central vasopressin recep-
tors in social and aggressive behaviors, and affective states, including anxiety-like behavior
[54]. We would expect that agonism of these receptors by oxytocin would have pro-stress,
pro-drinking effects rather than contributing to a reduction in alcohol drinking in dependent
rats in this model. Consistent with this hypothesis, Edwards and colleagues reported that
V1b antagonism in dependent rats decreased their alcohol drinking [73]. Similar effects have
also been reported in Sardinian alcohol-preferring rats [74] and alcohol-dependent humans
[75].
In summary, the present study reports that oxytocin via central rather than peripheral
action reduced alcohol consumption and motivation for alcohol in an animal model of alcohol
dependence. These effects may result from dependence-induced alterations in oxytocin and
GABA systems in reward- and stress-related extrahypothalamic brain regions such as the
extended amygdala. Intranasal oxytocin administration appears to be advantageous in terms
of specificity in reducing alcohol-motivated behavior compared with intraperitoneal adminis-
tration. Therefore, the present work highlights the oxytocin system as a target for understand-
ing the plasticity of brain stress and anti-stress systems in the etiology of alcohol use disorders.
Targeting this system, possibly by intranasal administration, may provide novel pharmaceuti-
cal interventions for the treatment of alcohol use disorder.
