Summary
Background Psychological treatments for adolescents with unipolar major depressive disorder are associated with 
diagnostic remission within 28 weeks in 65–70% of patients. We aimed to assess the medium-term effects and 
costs of psychological therapies on maintenance of reduced depression symptoms 12 months after treatment.
Methods We did this multicentre, pragmatic, observer-blind, randomised controlled superiority trial (IMPACT) at 
15 National Health Service child and adolescent mental health service (CAMHS) clinics in three regions in England. 
Adolescent patients (aged 11–17 years) with a diagnosis of DSM IV major depressive disorder were randomly 
assigned (1:1:1), via a web-based randomisation service, to receive cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or short-
term psychoanalytical therapy versus a reference brief psychological intervention. Randomisation was stochastically 
minimised by age, sex, self-reported depression sum score, and region. Patients and clinicians were aware of group 
allocation, but allocation was concealed from outcome assessors. Patients were followed up and reassessed at 
weeks 6, 12, 36, 52, and 86 post-randomisation. The primary outcome was self-reported depression symptoms at 
weeks 36, 52, and 86, as measured with the self-reported Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ). Because our 
aim was to compare the two psychological therapies with the brief psychosocial intervention, we first established 
whether CBT was inferior to short-term psychoanalytical psychotherapy for the same outcome. Primary analysis 
was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN83033550.
Findings Between June 29, 2010, and Jan 17, 2013, we randomly assigned 470 patients to receive the brief psychosocial 
intervention (n=158), CBT (n=155), or short-term psychoanalytical therapy (n=157); 465 patients comprised the 
intention-to-treat population. 392 (84%) patients had available data for primary analysis by the end of follow-up. 
Treatment fidelity and differentiation were established between the three interventions. The median number of 
treatment sessions differed significantly between patients in the brief psychosocial intervention group (n=6 
[IQR 4–11]), CBT group (n=9 [5–14]), and short-term psychoanalytical therapy group (n=11 [5–23]; p<0·0001), but 
there was no difference between groups in the average duration of treatment (27·5 [SD 21·5], 24·9 [17·7], 27·9 [16·8] 
weeks, respectively; Kruskal–Wallis p=0·238). Self-reported depression symptoms did not differ significantly between 
patients given CBT and those given short-term psychoanalytical therapy at weeks 36 (treatment effect 0·179, 95% CI 
–3·731 to 4·088; p=0·929), 52 (0·307, –3·161 to 3·774; p=0·862), or 86 (0·578, –2·948 to 4·104; p=0·748). These 
two psychological treatments had no superiority effect compared with brief psychosocial intervention at weeks 36 
(treatment effect –3·234, 95% CI –6·611 to 0·143; p=0·061), 52 (–2·806, –5·790 to 0·177; p=0·065), or 86 (–1·898, 
–4·922 to 1·126; p=0·219). Physical adverse events (self-reported breathing problems, sleep disturbances, drowsiness 
or tiredness, nausea, sweating, and being restless or overactive) did not differ between the groups. Total costs of the 
trial interventions did not differ significantly between treatment groups.
Interpretation We found no evidence for the superiority of CBT or short-term psychoanalytical therapy compared with 
a brief psychosocial intervention in maintenance of reduced depression symptoms 12 months after treatment. 
Short-term psychoanalytical therapy was as effective as CBT and, together with brief psychosocial intervention, offers 
additional patient choice for psychological therapy, alongside CBT, for adolescents with moderate to severe depression 
who are attending routine specialist CAMHS clinics.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
Unipolar major depression emerges with the highest incidence 
risk rate in the second decade of life, affecting a substantial 
proportion of the adolescent population worldwide. Good 
evidence exists for psychological treatments being associated 
with clinical remission in about 70% of cases. By contrast, data are 
scarce for whether one or more of the available therapies is 
associated with maintenance of reduced depressive symptoms 
1 year after the end of treatment. This issue is not trivial, because 
maintenance of depressive symptoms below a clinical threshold 
12 months after the end of treatment is associated with reduced 
risk for diagnostic relapse into the adult years. We searched 
PubMed between Aug 1, 1990, and Aug 31, 2016, with the search 
terms “adolescence”, “depression”, “psychological treatments”, 
“randomised controlled trials”, “remission”, “relapse”, “relapse 
prevention”, and “adverse effects”. This search identified 
three trials of school population-based interventions, a small 
(n=43) feasibility study of a social media intervention for relapse 
prevention in patients recovered from depression, and a Cochrane 
database review of relapse prevention in children and adolescents 
with depression. No identified psychological treatments are 
currently recommended as effective in maintaining reduced 
depressive symptoms in the year after successful treatment.
Added value of this study
Our findings show that short-term psychoanalytical 
psychotherapy and CBT, delivered by highly trained therapists 
over 28 weeks and 20 weeks, respectively, were not superior to 
a reference brief psychosocial intervention delivered over 
12 weeks by child and adolescent psychiatrists and mental 
health nurses. All three psychological treatments were 
associated with an average 49–52% reduction in depression 
symptoms 1 year after treatment. Prescribing of an SSRI 
during therapy or follow-up, as per National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence guidelines, did not differ between 
the treatment groups and so did not mediate the outcome. 
Suicide and self-harm attempts over the follow-up period 
were lower than at baseline, as were physical side-effects. 
Furthermore, total costs and quality-of-life scores did not 
differ between treatment groups by the end of the study.
Implications of all the available evidence
To our knowledge, this is the only high-quality, fully powered, 
superiority and cost-effectiveness study assessing the 
medium-term effects and costs of psychological treatments 
on maintenance of reduced depression symptoms 12 months 
after treatment. Short-term psychoanalytical psychotherapy is 
as effective as CBT and, together with brief psychosocial 
intervention, offers an additional patient choice for 
psychological therapy, alongside CBT, for adolescents with 
moderate to severe depression who are attending routine 
specialist child and adolescent mental health service clinics.
Introduction
Unipolar major depression is a clinically significant 
mental illness affecting a substantial proportion of 
adolescents worldwide.1 Although evidence exists for the 
effectiveness of treatments in the short term, data are 
scarce for whether one or more of the available 
psychological treatments is also able to maintain reduced 
depressive symptoms a year after the end of therapy.2,3 
This issue is not trivial, because maintenance of 
depressive symptoms below a clinical threshold level 
reduces the risk for diagnostic relapse into the adult 
years.4 Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) offers 
plausible long-term benefits for adolescents with 
depression, and is recommended as such by the National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).5 
Short-term psychoanalytical psychotherapy also shows 
preliminary promise as a treatment for adolescents with 
depression. CBT has established clinical effectiveness 
and relapse prevention, and short-term psychoanalytical 
psychotherapy has shown similar clinical effectiveness 
in adults with depression and some clinical effectiveness 
in adolescents.6–9
We did the IMPACT trial to assess the medium-term 
effects and costs of psychological therapies on main-
tenance of reduced depression symptoms 12 months 
after treatment. We tested a primary superiority 
hypothesis that CBT and short-term psychoanalytical 
psychotherapy would be more likely to maintain 
significantly lower depressive symptoms 1 year after 
treatment than would a reference brief psychosocial 
intervention. Because our aim was to compare 
two psychological therapies with a brief psychosocial 
intervention, we first established whether CBT was 
inferior to short-term psychoanalytical psychotherapy 
for the same outcomes.
Findings from previous studies10 of psychological 
treatment in adolescents with depression have shown 
reductions in anxiety symptoms even despite no 
reductions in depressive symptoms. Therefore, we 
tested a secondary hypothesis that, compared with 
participants assigned to receive brief psychosocial 
intervention, those assigned to receive CBT or short-
term psychoanalytical psychotherapy would be more 
likely to maintain significantly lower self-reported 
anxiety symptoms, but significantly higher research 
interviewer-evaluated psychosocial function, 1 year after 
treatment. Finally, a cost-effectiveness hypothesis tested 
whether the additional costs of CBT and short-term 
psychoanalytical psychotherapy could be justified by 
improvements in clinical effectiveness or decreased use 
of health and social care services compared with brief 
psychosocial intervention.

Method
Study design and participants 
We did this multicentre, pragmatic, single-blind, 
randomised controlled superiority trial in three regions of 
England: East Anglia, a largely rural area of 3 million 
people with four urban areas each containing about 
100 000 people; North London, a densely populated urban 
area with around 4 million people; and the North West of 
England, covering roughly 4 million people of whom 
about 1 million live in rural surroundings and 3 million 
live in the city of Manchester. Adolescents (aged 
11–17 years) with a diagnosis of DSM IV unipolar major 
depressive disorder were recruited from 15 routine 
National Health Service (NHS) child and adolescent 
mental health service (CAMHS) clinics (n=5 in each 
region).11,12 In the UK NHS, adolescents who do not 
respond to community-based treatments might be sent to 
specialist outpatient CAMHS. Therefore, the adolescents 
entered into this trial had high numbers of symptoms 
and concurrent personal impairments.
Exclusion criteria were generalised learning difficulties, 
pervasive developmental disorder, pregnancy, current 
use of another medication that could interact with an 
SSRI, current substance or alcohol abuse disorders, 
previous completion of one of the study treatments, and 
a primary diagnosis of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, 
or eating disorders. The study was approved by the 
Cambridgeshire 2 Research Ethics Committee (reference 
09/H0308/137) and local NHS provider trusts. The 
protocol has been previously published.13 All patients and 
their parents gave written informed consent.
Randomisation and masking
Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1), via a web-based 
randomisation service, to receive either CBT or short-
term psychoanalytical therapy versus the brief psycho-
logical intervention. Randomisation was done by the 
trial coordinator, with stochastic minimisation by age 
(11–13 years vs 14–15 years vs 16–17 years), sex, self-
reported depression sum score (≤29 vs 30–39 vs 40–49 vs 
≥50),8 and region (East Anglia vs North London vs 
North West England). In view of the nature of the 
interventions, patients and clinicians were aware of 
group allocation, but allocation was concealed from 
outcome assessors.
Procedures
All 
treatments 
were 
manualised; 
the 
appendix 
provides a full description of the treatment manuals, 
including theoretical and operational differences, 
and the manuals are available online. Short-term 
psychoanalytical psychotherapy comprised a planned 
programme of 28 sessions over 30 weeks, with parents 
or carers offered up to seven additional sessions by a 
separate parent worker. The techniques of this 
intervention are based on close and detailed observation 
of the relationship the child or young person makes 
with their therapist. The therapist introduces the 
therapeutic task to the young person as one of 
understanding feelings and difficulties in their life. The 
therapist is non-judgmental and enquiring, and conveys 
the value of self-understanding. Therapists were 
CAMHS 
clinicians 
with 
child 
and 
adolescent 
psychoanalytical psychotherapy training. Short-term 
psychoanalytical psychotherapy has been shown to be 
reliably and effectively delivered.9
CBT was based on the classic form originally 
developed for adults with depression.14 We adapted the 
intervention to include parental involvement, focused 
on engagement in therapy, and emphasised the use of 
behavioural techniques. The focus of CBT is to identify 
the behaviours and information processing biases that 
maintain depression and low mood, and to amend 
these through a process of collaborative empiricism 
between the therapist and patient. CBT comprised a 
planned programme of up to 20 sessions over 30 weeks. 
CBT therapists were routine CAMHS clinicians and 
were either clinical psychologists or other clinicians 
who had received post-qualification training in CBT.
The brief psychosocial intervention was derived from 
the routine specialist clinical care delivered in the ADAPT 
trial, and reformulated on the basis of findings suggesting 
this intervention might be clinically effective.9 Emphasis 
in the brief psychosocial intervention programme is on 
the importance of psychoeducation about depression, 
in addition to action-oriented, goal-focused, and inter-
personal activities as therapeutic strategies. Neither self-
understanding nor cognition change are components of 
the programme. The programme consists of 12 individual 
sessions, including up to four family or marital sessions 
delivered over 20 weeks. Therapists were drawn from 
routine CAMHS clinics.
For all three groups, liaison with external agencies and 
personnel (eg, teachers, social care) and peer group was 
commonly done. All therapy sessions were audiotaped. A 
computerised randomisation procedure was used to 
select tapes stratified by age, treatment, and whether 
obtained early (two to four sessions) or later (after four 
sessions) in the therapy. Randomisation was done with 
the Comparative Psychotherapy Process Scale and the 
Brief Psychosocial Intervention scale.15 Independent 
raters 
rated 
each 
treatment 
session 
from 
the 
three treatment modalities to assess treatment fidelity 
and differentiation (appendix). In accordance with NICE 
guidelines, fluoxetine could be added if clinicians 
deemed that combination therapy might accelerate the 
time to remission.5 A test dose of 10 mg was given for 
48 h, followed by 20 mg as a single dose. If no 
improvement was shown within 2–4 weeks, the dose 
could be adjusted upwards to a maximum of 60 mg.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was self-reported depression 
symptoms at weeks 36, 52, and 86 post-randomisation

(ie, end of treatment), as measured with the Mood and 
Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ).16 Secondary outcomes 
were self-reported sum scores on the Revised Children’s 
Manifest Anxiety Scale (RMAS), the revised Leyton 
Obsessional Inventory (LOI) for adolescents, and the 
Health of the Nation Outcome Scales for Children and 
Adolescents—a measure of overall current psychosocial 
impairment.17–19 A brief self-reported antisocial behaviour 
checklist based on DSM IV criteria for conduct disorder 
was used as a binary (none, one or more) measure of 
antisocial behavioural symptoms. Presence of major 
depressive disorder was also measured over time by use 
of the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorder and 
Schizophrenia.20 The study was not however powered to 
test a specific diagnosis hypothesis. Two additional 
clinical measures were assessed: the Columbia Suicide 
Inventory21 and the self-report Risk and Self Harm 
Inventory.22 Economic measures included the Child and 
Adolescent Service Use Schedule, for collection of 
service and other resource use data, and the EuroQol 5D 
questionnaire 3-level measure of health-related quality 
of life, for calculation of quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs).23,24
Statistical analysis
The appendix details the statistical analysis plan. 
A 2·5% two-sided significance level was used for 
calculation of sample size and interpretation of 
analyses. Clustering of patients by therapist was 
assumed. Five points on the MFQ was taken to 
represent 
a 
clinically 
important 
difference 
for 
assessment of superiority, which corresponded to an 
improvement of one point on five of the 33 items of the 
MFQ—ie, a standardised effect size of 0·34 (small to 
medium), corresponding to non-overlap between 
treatments of about 25%. Data from the ADAPT trial 
gave an estimate of the SD of the primary outcome 
measure (14·6) and correlation between baseline and 
follow-up (0·41).11 We planned for a recruited sample 
size of 540 individuals. With an assumption of 
90% follow-up (n=486) and a 2·5% significance level to 
account for multiplicity, the power for the comparison 
of CBT with short-term psychoanalytical therapy was 
84% if the intraclass correlation coefficient was zero, 
76% if the coefficient was 0·025, and 69% if the 
coefficient was 0·05.25 For the comparison of CBT and 
short-term 
psychoanalytical 
therapy 
with 
brief 
psychological intervention, the power was 93%, 88%, 
and 82% for an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0·0, 
0·025, or 0·05, respectively.25
The marginal treatment effect was estimated with a 
linear mixed model, with a random effect for therapist, 
patient, and slope. To prevent bias due to assessments 
being delayed, time since randomisation was used as a 
continuous variable in a longitudinal mixed model 
(appendix). Diagnosis of major depressive disorder 
(present vs absent) was analysed with a logistic 
generalised estimating equation model over the same 
time period. To investigate non-response, a logistic 
generalised estimating equation model was fitted to an 
indicator variable for missing primary outcome data. 
All analyses included fixed covariates prespecified at 
baseline: MFQ, RMAS, LOI, Antisocial Behaviour 
Questionnaire (ABQ) scores, treatment allocation, 
region, sex, age at randomisation, comorbid behaviour 
disorder, and prescription of SSRI before trial entry 
(appendix).
There are no standardised methods for measuring 
the adverse effects of psychological treatments given to 
adolescents with depression. We derived a physical 
adversities score from self-reported items of breathing 
problems, sleep disturbances, drowsiness or tiredness, 
nausea, sweating, and being restless or overactive rated 
present or absent.
Methods of the economic evaluation have been 
applied previously26 and are shown in the appendix 
and available online. In brief, cost-effectiveness was 
explored at the 86 week follow-up point, with outcomes 
expressed as QALYs and costs assessed from a service 
perspective (health, social care, and education). Unit 
costs were for the financial year 2011–12, and costs 
and QALYs were discounted at a rate of 3·5% as 
recommended by NICE.27 Differences in mean costs 
were tested with linear regression models, with validity 
of the results confirmed with bias-corrected, non-
parametric bootstrapping (5000 resamples).25 For the 
cost-effectiveness analysis, we calculated incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratios (the difference in mean cost 
divided by the difference in mean effect) and explored 
uncertainty with cost-effectiveness acceptability curves, 
which show the probability that each of the treatments 
is the optimum choice, for a range of possible values of 
willingness to pay for additional QALYs.28 All economic 
analyses were adjusted for the prespecified covariates 
and for baseline utility and cost, as appropriate. 
Complete case analysis was used, with the effect of 
missing data and sessions offered but not attended 
explored in sensitivity analyses.
We did analysis by intention to treat, subject to the 
availability of data. Analyses were done with Stata 
(version 12.0). This trial is registered with Current 
Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN83033550.

psychoanalytical therapy (n=157; figure). Five patients 
withdrew before starting treatment and requested 
data be deleted; the remaining 465 participants 
comprised the intention-to-treat population (figure). 
The patient recruitment rate was 40% in East Anglia, 
33% in the North West, and 27% in North London 
(table 1). 63 therapists delivered the brief psychosocial 
intervention, 
44 
therapists 
delivered 
CBT, 
and 
38 therapists delivered short-term psychoanalytical 
therapy. Most (n=53) brief psychosocial intervention 
therapists were either psych 
iatrists who had passed 
postgraduate general training (ie, obtained membership 
of the Royal College of Psychiatrists) and subsequently 
entered specialist CAMHS psychiatry training or 
consultants. The primary analysis population com 
prised 
392 (84%) patients who provided one or more self-
reported depression symptom scores at weeks 36, 52, 
and 86 (figure). 39 (10%) patients had one MFQ score, 
90 (23%) had two MFQ scores, and 263 (67%) had 
three MFQ scores. The number of patients with follow-
up data for secondary outcomes was similar between 
treatment groups. The data available were within the 
margins suggested by the power calculation. Baseline 
characteristics were similar between groups (table 1).
The appendix shows the full profile of depression 
symptoms at baseline (appendix). The mean number of 
symptoms was 8·4 (SD 2·5) in patients undergoing 
brief psychosocial intervention, 8·7 (2·3) in patients 
undergoing CBT, and 8·3 (2·5) in patients undergoing 
short-term psychoanalytical therapy (appendix). The 
most prevalent symptom was sleep disturbance (n=427 
[92%]) followed by depressed mood (n=390 [84%]; 
appendix). Psychotic symptoms were uncommon (n=48 
[10%]), but a notable number of patients had current 
suicidal ideas (n=284 [61%]) and lifetime suicide attempts 
(n=177 [38%]; appendix). Symptom prevalence rates were 
similar between treatment groups (appendix). 225 (48%) 
patients had concurrent comorbid psychiatric disorders: 
71 (46%) in the brief psychosocial intervention group, 
80 (52%) in the CBT group, and 74 (47%) in the short-
term psychoanalytical therapy group (appendix). Overall, 
134 (29%) patients had one comorbidity, 60 (13%) patients

had two comorbidities, and 31 (7%) patients had three or 
more comorbidities, with no marked differences between 
groups. Non-suicidal self-injury in the previous 2 weeks 
was reported in 85 (18%) patients: 26 (17%) assigned 
to the brief psychosocial intervention, 25 (16%) assigned 
to CBT, and 34 (22%) assigned to short-term psycho-
analytical therapy; lifetime non-suicidal self-injury was 
reported in 246 (53%) participants: 87 (56%), 75 (49%), 
and 84 (54%), respectively.
The number of patients starting therapy was 147 (93%) 
in the brief psychosocial intervention group, 142 (92%) in 
the CBT group, and 136 (87%) in the short-term 
psychoanalytical therapy group, with no differences in 
proportions between groups (χ² p=0·203). The number of 
individual treatment sessions given per group was less 
than planned (median six [IQR four to 11] in the brief 
psychosocial intervention group, nine [five to 14] in the 
CBT group, and 11 [five to 23] in the short-term 
psychoanalytical therapy group), but differed significantly 
between groups (Kruskal–Wallis p<0·0001; appendix). Of 
patients assigned to receive the brief psychosocial 
intervention, 24 (17%) had more sessions than the manual 
specified, compared with five (3%) assigned to receive 
CBT and three (2%) assigned to receive short-term 
psychoanalytical therapy. Mean duration of therapy did 
not differ significantly between treatment groups 
(27·5 weeks [SD 21·5] in the brief psychosocial 
intervention group, 24·9 weeks (SD 17·7) in the CBT 
group, 27·9 weeks [16·8] in the short-term psychoanalytical 
therapy group; Kruskal–Wallis p=0·238).
Raters assessed treatment fidelity by use of 232 audio 
tapes: 75 tapes for brief psychosocial intervention 
sessions, 76 tapes for CBT sessions, and 81 tapes for 
short-term psychoanalytical therapy sessions. Overall, 
60 (81%) brief psychosocial intervention sessions, 
61 (80%) short-term psychoanalytical therapy sessions, 
and 60 (74%) CBT sessions met treatment fidelity criteria 
(appendix). Treatment differentiation was good: the mean 
cognitive behavioural subscale score on the Comparative 
Psychotherapy Process Scale was 1·91 (95% CI 1·73–2·09) 
higher for CBT sessions than for short-term psycho-
analytical therapy sessions (p<0·0001), whereas the 
mean psychodynamic interpersonal subscale score was 
1·18 (1·01–1·30) higher for short-term psychoanalytical 
therapy sessions than for CBT sessions (p<0·0001). 
Patients 
attending 
brief 
psychosocial 
intervention 
sessions had a signifi 
cantly lower mean score on 
the cognitive behavioural subscale than did those 
attending CBT sessions (mean difference –0·93, 95% CI 
–1·12 to –0·75; p<0·0001) and a significantly lower mean 
score on the psychodynamic interpersonal subscale than 
did those attending short-term psychoanalytical therapy 
sessions (–1·30, –1·48 to –1·11; p<0·0001).
The number of patients receiving an SSRI before 
randomisation was 29 (19%) in the brief psychosocial 
intervention group, 32 (21%) in the CBT group, and 
28 (18%) in the short-term psychoanalytical therapy 
group; by the end of study, the number of patients who 
reported having received an SSRI at any time over the 
course of the trial (randomisation up to 86 weeks) was 
56 (41%), 55 (40%), and 50 (36%), respectively (p=0·729; 
appendix).
Behavioural disorder at baseline was found to predict 
non-response. Because this was not a prespecified 
baseline covariate, it was added to all models of outcome 
to support the missing-at-random assumption. The 
appendix provides data for time from randomisation to 
assessment and estimates of the main effect and time 
with treatment interaction.
 The primary outcome of self-reported depression 
symptoms (MFQ) at weeks 36, 52, and 86 did not differ 
significantly between patients in the CBT group and 
those in the short-term psychoanalytical therapy group, 
nor between those in the CBT or short-term psycho-
analytical therapy groups combined versus the brief 
psychological intervention group (table 2). With a lower 
score representing improved outcome, we recorded a 
larger difference in favour of combined established 
treatments at weeks 36 and 52 (table 2), but these 
reductions were not statistically significant, less than 
the five unit difference prespecified as clinically

meaningful, and not accompanied by differences in 
psychosocial impairment. The secondary outcomes of 
anxiety and obsessional symptoms were significantly 
reduced after the psychological treatments combined 
versus brief psychosocial therapy at week 36 only 
(table 2). The therapist intracluster correlation 
coefficient for therapy outcomes was calculated as the 
proportion of the random intercept variance, and was 
negligible (<10–⁷) for all the models (data not shown). 
Study power was therefore at the upper end of the 
range, because the sample size calculation included a 
range of values of the intracluster correlation coefficient, 
from 0 to 0·05.
Table 3 shows findings for the secondary binary 
outcomes of patients who self-reported no or one or 
more antisocial behaviour symptoms and patients 
who met clinical diagnostic criteria for major depres 
sive disorder. Compared with brief psychosocial 
intervention, CBT and short-term psychoanalytical 
therapy led to significantly lower self-reported ABQ 
scores at week 36, but this difference was not 
maintained at week 52.

in the short-term psychoanalytical therapy group), and 
no patients at 86 weeks, compared with 12 (3%) of 
465 patients at baseline (table 1). Similarly, non-suicidal 
self-injury attempts were reported in 19 (7%) of 
268 patients at 36 weeks (n=10 in the brief psychosocial 
intervention group, n=6 in the CBT group, n=3 in the 
short-term psychoanalytical therapy group), 14 (4%) of 
234 patients at 52 weeks (n=6, n= 2, n=6, respectively), 
and 16 (5%) of 257 at 86 weeks (n=7, n=5, n=4, 
respectively), which compares favourably with self-
harm attempts reported at baseline (n=85 [18%]; 
table 1). On the basis of our physical adversities score, 
we recorded a decline in the self-reporting of adverse 
physical events over the course of the study, with no 
observable differences between treatment groups 
(table 4).
The proportion of patients in diagnostic remission by 
36, 52, or 86 weeks did not differ significantly between 
groups (data not shown). Because the present study is 
pragmatic, with no control group, we did a comparison 
of the 12 week remission rate with the rate in the TADS 
study,3 which included a pill placebo control group 
(n=111): 145 (48%) of 305 patients were in remission at 
12 weeks in our study compared with 37 (34%) placebo 
patients in the TADS study. Additionally, in the treatment 
trial of resistant depression in adolescents,29 203 (61%) of 
334 patients were in diagnostic remission by week 72 
compared with 221 (77%) of 286 by week 86 in this study. 
Finally, 15 (11%) of the 140 patients in remission at 
week 36 had relapsed by week 86 (n=5/48 [10%] in the 
brief psychosocial intervention group, n=8/49 [8%] in 
the CBT group, n=2/48 [4%] in the short-term 
psychoanalytical therapy group; p=0·149).
The cost of the trial interventions was lowest for 
CBT (mean £904·57 [SD 607·25]) and highest for short-
term psychoanalytical therapy (£1396·72 [1133·41]), with 
the brief psychosocial intervention costing a mean of 
£1292·91 (851·29; appendix). The costs of use of all other 
services (health, social care, and education) differed little 
between patients in the brief psychosocial intervention 
group (mean £1385·4 [SD 2807·7]), the CBT group 
(£1459·26 [3481·02]), and the short-term psychoanalytical 
therapy group (£1668·51 [3425·68]) over 86 weeks 
(appendix). The total combined cost of trial interventions 
and use of other services was £2678·39 (SD 2678·39) for 
the brief psychosocial intervention, £2379·01 (3643·85) 
for CBT, and £3081·70 (3573·17) for short-term psycho-
analytical therapy; neither these costs, nor QALYs 
(mean 1·241 [SD 0·270], 1·228 [0·304], and 1·246 [0·293] 
QALYs, respectively), differed significantly between 
groups over 86 weeks (appendix). No evidence supported 
the superior cost-effectiveness of short-term psycho-
analytical therapy compared with brief psychosocial 
intervention or CBT, or CBT compared with brief 
psychosocial intervention (appendix).
Discussion
We found no evidence for the superiority of CBT 
or short-term psychoanalytical therapy compared with 
a brief psychosocial intervention for maintenance 
of reduced depression symptoms 12 months after 
treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first trial to

show that short-term psychoanalytical therapy and brief 
psychosocial intervention are as clinically effective as 
CBT for the treatment of adolescents with depression. 
We note the continuing decline of symptoms and further 
increase in remission, which are not explained by any 
marked differences in post-treatment service use, costs 
between therapies, or reported SSRI use. However, 
caution is required with the findings for remission 
because the study was not powered for treatment group 
comparisons, interview data were missing at each 
timepoint, and the control comparison could only be 
achieved at 12 weeks. We also note the small reduction 
in symptoms in favour of established treatments at the 
end (36 weeks) of treatment, but not by end of study, 
which is consistent with previous reports of psychological 
treatment effects on reducing anxiety in patients with 
depression.10 No participants reported increases in 
suicidal ideation, non-suicidal self-injury, or adverse 
physical side-effects during the study.
Three previous randomised controlled trials similar in 
design to the present study have reported follow-up data 
beyond end of treatment. Birmaher and colleagues30 
reassessed 107 adolescents with major depressive 
disorder 2 years after treatment with CBT, systematic 
behavioural family therapy, or non-directive supportive 
therapy. There were no differences in outcome by 
original treatment group. A naturalistic follow-up study31 
of 196 adolescents with depression (45% of the original 
sample) recruited to a treatment trial reported that 5 year 
post-trial recurrence was more likely in participants with 
higher depressive symptom scores at the end of 
treatment, but was not associated with treatment type. 
Most recently, a 6 year follow-up study32 of a cognitive 
behaviour programme aimed at prevention of depressive 
episodes showed that the strongest effect was early and 
better maintained with additional booster sessions and 
treatment of parental depression. Overall these findings 
are consistent in their suggestion that early response to 
treatment can be followed by continued improvement 
across different treatment modalities. The absence of 
difference between the three treatments assessed in the 
present study might be due to a putative shared common 
effect, but could also be a result of alternative 
explanations, including three unique effects leading to 
the same outcome or even to no effect, with the decline 
in symptoms being due to change over time.
Reports of non-response to treatment in 21–25% of 
trial patients are also consistent with these results.3,11,28–30 
Such non-response might be due to issues of selection 
of the right treatment for the right patient, noting the 
likelihood of resistance to a given treatment early in 
therapy, or to prediction of the likelihood of non-
compliance. One challenge for further research is to 
improve the precision of the ability to select the best 
treatment for a given patient with depression. Despite 
the planned differences in treatment intensity, in 
practice, young people attended a median of six to 11 
sessions over 25–28 weeks across all three treatment 
groups. A first course of therapy for adolescents with 
depression could be brief (six to 11 sessions) and at no 
difference in cost between the available treatment 
options assessed in this trial. The reasons for non-
attendance deserve further investigation.
Our study had various strengths, including that 
participants were representative of the population with 
moderate 
to 
severe 
depression, 
with 
self-harm, 
suicidality, and non-depressive comorbid disorders at the 
point of referral; CAMHS referral across diverse regions 
of the UK; meeting of research diagnostic criteria for 
DSM IV major depressive disorder; and randomisation 
done remotely from the research team. There was a loss 
to follow-up, but data for the primary outcome measure 
(MFQ) were available in 84% of participants. The overall 
sample size was greater than in previous studies, and 
this is the first time a trial of adolescents with depression 
has been designed to follow up participants for 52 weeks 
after the end of treatment. Each of the three treatments 
was manualised, interventions were delivered as 
expected, and clear differences in approach were 
maintained between therapies. Some patients in all 
three groups received antidepressant medication. This 
characteristic strengthens generalisability, but restricts 
the interpretation of the findings. Methods of prescribing 
did not differ between groups over the course of the 
study, and fluoxetine was prescribed both during and 
after the end of treatment. Neither the reasons for 
prescribing nor medication compliance were controlled 
for over the study course; therefore, we cannot exclude 
the possibility that SSRIs might have contributed to the 
improvements over time. Furthermore, the declines in 
symptoms and improvements in wellbeing could be a 
function of time. The absence of a no-treatment control 
group restricts the assertion that any therapy was causally 
effective. The economic results were limited by missing 
data, which was higher than for the primary clinical 
outcome measure (40%). Multiple imputation of missing 
data did not, however, change the economic results of the

We derived a physical adversities scores based on six self-reported adverse items: breathing problems, sleep disturbances, 
drowsiness or tiredness, nausea, sweating, and being restless or overactive rated present or absent. BPI=brief 
psychological intervention. CBT=cognitive behavioural therapy. STPP=short-term psychoanalytical psychotherapy.

analysis. Future research should focus on psychological 
mechanisms associated with treatment response, the 
maintenance of positive effects, non-response, and 
whether or not brief psychotherapies are of use in 
community and primary care settings.
In summary, brief psychosocial intervention, CBT, 
and short-term psychoanalytical therapy are all 
associated with maintenance of reduced depression 
symptoms 1 year after the end of treatment. Short-term 
psychoanalytical therapy and brief psychosocial inter-
ventions offer additional patient choice, alongside CBT, 
for depressed adolescents attending routine specialist 
CAMHS clinics.
Contributors
IMG, SR, SB, BD, JH, RK, CR, MT, and PF were responsible for the 
original proposal, securing funding, for the trial, and for drafting the 
original protocol. IMG as chief investigator had overall responsibility 
for the management of the study. SR, RK, and IMG had responsibility 
for the East Anglia site; JH and BD for the North West site; and RS, 
NM, MT, and PF for the North London site. RK, BD, PW, and IMG 
were responsible for the development of the brief psychosocial 
intervention manual and provided training and supervision for the 
therapists in East Anglia. Medical leadership and supervision for the 
brief psychosocial intervention was provided by RK in East Anglia, RS 
in North London, and BD and JH in the North West. NM, MT, and PF 
developed the short-term psychoanalytical therapy manual and 
ensured and coordinated short-term psychoanalytical therapists for the 
study, together with JH in the North West. SR developed the CBT 
manual and coordinated the therapists’ election, training, and 
supervision for the study; BD and JH coordinated CBT therapy in the 
North West. BW was project manager throughout the trial, developed 
and coordinated the randomisation and minimisation protocol with 
IMG and CR. BW set up and coordinated the database, with all data 
held in a single repository on the Cambridge site. NM, SR, RK, and BD 
coordinated and supervised the treatment fidelity project and analysed 
the data with CR. FH, CR, BB, and SB wrote the statistical analysis 
plan and did the analyses. BW and FH were responsible for data 
cleaning. IMG wrote the initial draft of the manuscript. All authors 
contributed to and approved the final manuscript.
