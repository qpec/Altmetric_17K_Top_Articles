Background: Health concerns unique to women are growing with the large number of women venturing into
different trades that expose them to hot working environments and inadequate sanitation facilities, common
in many Indian workplaces.
Objective: The study was carried out to investigate the health implications of exposures to hot work
environments and inadequate sanitation facilities at their workplaces for women workers.
Design: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 312 women workers in three occupational sectors in
2014�2015. Quantitative data on heat exposures and physiological heat strain indicators such as core body
temperature (CBT), sweat rate (SwR), and urine specific gravity (USG) were collected. A structured
questionnaire captured workers perceptions about health impacts of heat stress and inadequate sanitary
facilities at the workplace.
Results: Workplace heat exposures exceeded the threshold limit value for safe manual work for 71% women
(Avg. wet bulb globe temperature �308C92.38C) during the study period. Eighty-seven percent of the 200
women who had inadequate/no toilets at their workplaces reported experiencing genitourinary problems
periodically. Above normal CBT, SwR, and USG in about 10% women workers indicated heat strain and
moderate dehydration that corroborated well with their perceptions. Observed significant associations between
high-heat exposures and SwR (t��2.3879, p�0.0192), inadequate toilet facilities and self-reported adverse
heat-related health symptoms (x2�4.03, p�0.0444), and prevalence of genitourinary issues (x2�42.92,
p�0.0005�10�7) reemphasize that heat is a risk and lack of sanitation facilities is a major health concern for
women workers.
Conclusions: The preliminary evidence suggests that health of women workers is at risk due to occupational
heat exposures and inadequate sanitation facilities at many Indian workplaces. Intervention through strong
labor policies with gender sensitivity is the need of the hour to empower women, avert further health risks,
and also enhance productivity for the few million women workers who contribute largely to the country’s
economy.

Introduction
India is a tropical country with a very hot summer season
in many parts that threatens the health of millions of
people (1, 2), and workers are exposed to excessive work-
place heat (3, 4). In 2013, more than 600 deaths were
reported due to heat waves in the southern Indian states
Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, where the temperatures
have soared as high as 47.28C, while many other states
experienced severe drought (2), and excess mortality due
to heat was reported in Ahmedabad (1). During the hottest
season in parts of India, daily climate conditions are
untenable with respect to physical labor (5, 6). Hot work

 environments increase the health risks for poor workers
engaged in manual work and reduce their hourly produc-
tivity and daily incomes (4). One of the most direct health
effects occurring from global change in temperatures is
the increase in mortality and morbidity associated with
exposure to high ambient temperatures in certain parts of
the globe, including parts of India (7).
Heavy workload in hot working environments creates
substantial surplus heat inside the body, and when the air
temperature exceeds 378C, evaporation of sweat becomes
the only mechanism to cool the body, but sweat evapora-
tion is strongly impaired by high air humidity and clothing
(8). Many jobs involving high-heat exposure, especially
in informal sectors, have a large proportion of women
workers who are engaged in physical work (9). Women,
because of their size, physical capacity, and other physio-
logical factors, are more vulnerable to health risks (10�12).
Women in developing nations have to handle the burden
of housework and heavy manual work in jobs which
is sometimes beyond their physical capacity (13), and
when combined with hot working environments further
increases the health risks (14, 15). Also, Indian women
could be more vulnerable to elevated environmental
temperatures as evidenced by a higher number of reported
excessdeathsof womenduringtheheat wavein Ahmedabad,
2010 (1).
Individuals exposed to high temperature at their work-
place suffer from several heat-related illnesses, including
heat stroke, heat exhaustion, heat cramps, heat syncope
(fainting), and heat rash (16�22). In such conditions, sweat
output often exceeds water intake, resulting in a body
water deficit (hypohydration) and electrolyte losses (23).
Dehydration and lack of adequate fluid replacement can
undermine the health and performance of an individual
and leave them particularly vulnerable to the ill effects
of high-heat loads (24, 25) that can further be aggravated
by lack of proper sanitation facilities at workplaces.
No issue touches the lives of women, particularly
working women, as intimately as that of access to proper
sanitation. Although men also suffer from the burden
of poor sanitation, they are more likely to resort to other
means to relieve themselves. But women’s anatomy,
modesty, and susceptibility to attack do not allow them
to discreetly relieve themselves in public places (26�28).
Lack of adequate sanitation facilities at the workplaces
subjects women to suffer periodically from urogenital
problems such as urinary tract infection (UTI), burning
sensation, and edema/swollen legs (29).
Lack of access to toilets in some workplaces, in turn,
causes some women to eat and drink less, in order to
avoid having to defecate or urinate for several hours, thus
putting them at a higher risk for malnutrition (3). The
most commonly provided heat protection advice to avert
adverse health impacts of heat exposures, among others,
is to wear lightweight loose-fitting clothing, seek out an
air-conditioned or cool environment, avoid physical activ-
ities, and drink fluids regularly (7). Drinking frequently
to maintain the body’s water balance is possible but might
create another issue of need to urinate frequently, which
becomes an inconvenience to women workers in jobs with
lack of access to proper toilet facilities at their workplaces
(30). The health burden of inadequate sanitation may
cause women to purposely restrict their fluid intake,
despite thirst or heat signals, in order to avoid the need
for a toilet (31, 32). Delaying urination and refraining
from drinking water to avoid using the toilet often lead to
dehydration in heat and cause internal injuries such as
acute kidney injuries (AKI) or UTIs (28). For women who
are menstruating, the need for adequate sanitation be-
comes even more acute (30), and the lackof access to it puts
them at a higher risk of urogenital infections (4).
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has pre-
dicted increase in temperatures by the year 2100 to the
extent of 2�38C around the globe according to RCP
scenario 6.0 (33) and is expected to affect the living and
working environments that could create health threats
for millions of people (34). Although the rates of heat-
related morbidities and mortalities are declining, and
future trends look better in many countries (35, 36)
and in many developing countries with high ambient
temperatures, the burden of health risks due to heat is still
looming (7, 14, 37, 38). The heat situation might be further
aggravated in many workplaces with minimal/no cooling
intervention that is very common in developing nations
and for outdoor women workers performing manual work,
especially with the predicted rise in temperatures due to
climate change (33).
Importantly, many jobs involving high-heat exposures
and heavy manual workload in informal sectors, like in
construction, brick kilns, and agriculture, have a large
proportion of women workers in India, (9) and these
workplaces lack basic facilities like toilets, or most often
have none. As per the 2012 census, the total population of
India (2012) was 1.22 billion out of which 591.4 million
are females. The number certainly indicates that these
people are invaluable assets to the country, thus making
it necessary to empower them to contribute to the nation’s
economy. Hence, poor health of working women is a
concern at both an individual and national level.
In such context, it becomes important that studies
addressing the issue in question are conducted to bring in
the research understanding, knowledge, and evidence
to help build upon existing labor policies that can be
implemented as effective prevention policies to help avert
current and future health risks for millions of poor
women workers. No study has been conducted in Indian
workplaces to understand the combined influence of
heat exposures and inadequate sanitation facilities and
associated health risks to women workers. The investiga-
tors thought it was imperative to address the issue and

 conducted the study in three occupational sectors in
southern India.
Methodology
We conducted this cross-sectional study in three occupa-
tional sectors: brick manufacturing (two brick kilns in two
districts of Tamil Nadu), one steel manufacturing industry,
and agriculture fields (five agricultural fields in two
different states in southern India) in 2014�2015. These
sectors employed predominantly women for certain types
of jobs which involved manual hard work. The women
workers had direct heat exposures throughout the day and
had long working hours, depending on the season, in brick
and agriculture. We obtained prior ethical clearance from
the Institutional Ethics Committee and permission from
the concerned management for the study. Our qualified
and experienced nurse explained the risks and benefits of
participating in the study to the workers.
Data collection using questionnaire
We recruited and interviewed 312 women workers engaged
in medium-to-heavy work whovolunteered for the study to
collect the necessary information after getting informed
consent from the workers. We administered a modified
version of an internationally validated High Occupational
Temperature Health and Productivity Suppression ques-
tionnaire (Supplementary file) (4) to collect the informa-
tion on age and sex, sociodemographics, personal habits,
workload, clothing worn, worker’s time-activity pattern,
toilet availability and use, menstrual cycle phase, health
history, information on intake history of any medication,
and occupational history at the workplace. An elaborate
section on self-reported heat-related health illnesses; in-
formation pertaining to existing sanitation facilities, in
particular toilet facilities at workplace available to women
employees; behavioral patterns; water intake, heat stress,
and workload; and their perceptions on the health impacts
of heat stress and lack of toilet facilities that reflected their
personal experiences of the heat and the symptoms of each
illness were explained to the study participant by the
interviewer. Most of the workers could speak and under-
stand the local language that was spoken by the interviewer.
Heat exposure assessment and physiological
measurements
Occupational heat exposure at each participant’s work-
place was assessed as per the protocols recommended by
NIOSH, USA (1986) (39). Quantitative data on environ-
mental heat stress within the industry were assessed
via measurements of the wet bulb globe temperature
(WBGT) using a calibrated portable heat stress monitor
(QuesTemp834; QUEST Technologies, USA) during the
hottest part of the day (10 a.m.�4 p.m.). We allowed
the equipment to stabilize for 15 min before taking
measurements (40) in each location and kept away from
objects that might block radiant heat or air flow. The
work category of the workers was based on the judgment
by a trained industrial hygienist based on ACGIH
guidelines and by observations that were compared with
the ACGIH screening limits (40).
Data on physiological parameters, such as core body
temperature (CBT), sweat rate (SwR), and urine specific
gravity (USG), were assessed for women employees
who volunteered and consented for such investigations
(n�177) during the work shift. Care was taken not to
hamper their workflow, as the participants did not receive
any compensation for participating in the study. CBT was
assessed using 3M, Quest Temp Personal II monitors,
which give minute-by-minute CBT variations experienced
by the worker. It was measured before the onset of
work (pre-exposure CBT) and after the work shift (post-
exposure CBT). The reference range for the workers was
increased greater than 18C in post-exposure CBT (41).
The SwRwas calculated using the formula of Canadian
Sports Association (42). The body weight was measured,
using a weighing scale (accurate to 0.1 kg) before the start
and end of the work. A recommended limit value for SwR
is 1.0 L/h (41). Data on the quantity of liquid consump-
tion during the study time in a work shift and the time
gap between urinations were collected from the study
participants to check the SwR. USG was measured via a
standard urinometer, and the safe limit of USG was
considered as 1.010�1.020 (43).
Data analysis was done using basic statistical tools such
as Excel and R software. For the descriptive data, single
proportions like prevalence of heat stress and heat-related
health problems/productivity loss were tested for signifi-
cance using the t-test, chi-square test, and odds ratio
(OR). A standard cutoff of 0.05 was used to interpret the
significance of the p-values for all analysis.
Results
The mean age of the study population (312 female
workers) from three occupational sectors, brick manufac-
turing, steel manufacturing, and agriculture fields, was
42911.5 years, with only 30% having some basic level of
education and all other were illiterates. Twelve percent
had some pre-existing medical conditions, such as dia-
betes and hypertension. Most of the participants from
agriculture fields and brick manufacturing were engaged
in a similar profession or similar type of work for more
than 10 years. The participants from the steel manufac-
turing industry were engaged in the same profession of
housekeeping and cleaning, which was physically intense
for an average of 8 years and had chronic exposures to
high heat at their workplace.

 apparent that about 71% (n�222) of the workers had
WBGT exposures higher than the recommended thresh-
old limit value (TLV) as per ACGIH guidelines (40).
Forty-two percent of the workers’ self-reported percep-
tions were that high-heat exposures throughout the year
was not an uncommon phenomena in their workplace,
with significantly higher heat exposures during summer
season. Heat exposures in various work categories show
the percentage of workers working above and below the
safe TLV limits in the study population (Fig. 2).
Heat stress and health impacts
Of the 312 workers recruited for the study, 95% of the women
workers perceived that heat stress exposures had adverse
impacts on their health and well-being (Table 1), and
widespread concerns about heat-related health issues were
prevalent among the women workers. Nearly 73% of these
workers reported that because of heat exposures they have
experienced chronic fatigue, 44% suffered from headache,
and �87% reported excessive sweating and thirst during
work shifts. Their perceptions are supported by the measured
physiological indicators of heat strain that are presented in
Table 2. A significant positive association was observed for
theincreasein SwRoftheworkers(7%),thefirst indicationof
dehydration, for those women (n�123) whose heat expo-
sures were above the TLV limits (t��2.38, p�0.0192).
Sanitation facility and health impacts
Women employed in the steel industry and a few agriculture
workers in one out of the five agricultural fields surveyed (in
the outskirts of Chennai city) had access to public toilets
facilities nearby (B0.5 km). However, the women workers
in both the brick kilns and other agricultural fields (that
were remotely located) did not have toilet facilities and had
to resort to open fields for reliving themselves. Sixty-four
percent (n�200) of the study participants did not have
access to toilet facilities at their workplaces, and the
association between women reporting heat-related health
symptoms and lack of access to toilets at workplaces was
significant (x2�4.0397, p�0.0444). Among the women
who had no access to toilets, 174 women (87%) reported
having had to experience specific genitourinary problems
periodically,

(x2�42.92, p�0.0005*10�7) (Table 3). The women with-
out access to toilets had six times higher odds of prevalence
of genitourinary issues compared with the women with
access to toilets, such as in the steel industry (OR �6.01,
95% CI: 3.45�10.47 pB0.0001) (Table 3). Women who had
no access to toilets at workplaces also reported drinking less
water (5%, n�17) to avoid having the need to frequently use
the toilet (x2�4.76, p�0.0290), and a significant associa-
tion was observed between ‘not drinking water’ (B1
L/shift) and prevalence of reported ‘genitourinary issues’
(n�17) (x2�20.03, p�0.0076*10�04). It was also ob-
served that women ‘not drinking sufficient water’ had four
times higher risk of developing genitourinary issues com-
paredwith women ‘drinking sufficient water’ (OR 4.01, 95%
CI: 2.16�7.45, pB0.0001) (Table 3).
Women without access to toilets (n�200) also re-
ported changes in urine volume (44%), color (39%),
experiencing
frequent
recurring
burning
sensations,
and UTIs (11%). Behavioral modification of ‘withhold
from urinating’ than it is convenient (about 2�4 h) was
adopted by the women (n�24), which was significantly
associated with lack of access to toilets (x2�12.2,
p�0.0003). A small percentage (2.0%) of women workers
also reported being diagnosed and treated for kidney
stones (Fig. 3). Ten percent reported staying home from
work during their menstrual period for hygiene purposes,
with consequent loss of wages for the day and psycho-
logical stress of displeasure of the supervisors.
Discussion
This study demonstrates that women workers are and
can be exposed to high levels of heat at work, which

 can potentially make them vulnerable to heat-related
illnesses, especially during hot seasons.
Heat exposures and associated health risks
Studies point to increased rate of mortality and potential
morbidity among the workers exposed to high ambient
temperature (43�50). In this study, about 71% of the
women were exposed to high occupational heat stress and
were working above the safe threshold limit of exposure
(40). The maximum WBGT of 41.78C was found in the
steel industry (Table 1) where the women were exposed to
high radiant heat from processes like smelting, casting,
and furnaces. Because the women in the steel industry
were engaged in housekeeping and cleaning in the
manufacturing area and outdoors, they had exposures
to radiation from both the sun and the various manu-
facturing processes throughout their shifts. Such extreme
heat exposures can make the women workers more
vulnerable to the risks of developing heat-related illnesses
(51, 52). Heat-related health issues were reported the
highest in brick and agriculture sectors with more than
95% of the workers experiencing adverse health issues
due to heat stress. The women in the open fields, like
in brick and agriculture, felt ‘very exposed’ to many
adversities and had to fend for themselves in case of
medical emergencies related to heat. The distance of the
work locations from the nearest hospital or doctor’s
clinic, which was usually quite far from the farms/brick
kilns, was a big concern for the workers. In the steel
industry, although 89% of women workers reported
adverse impacts of heat on their health (Table 1), only
40% reported productivity loss, as there were very few
options for the women workers to self-pace their work
due to tight production targets. Clearly, the women were
pushing beyond their physiological limits to complete
the set target for the day. Working at high temperatures
and beyond work capacity, without appropriate work rest
ratios, subjects the workers to the risks of developing
heat-related illnesses (26, 41). Although the women in the
steel industry were working beyond their work capacity
and were exposed to much higher WBGTs than in the
brick and agricultural fields, they are partially protected
by insurance and have an occupational health center in
case of occurrence of any heat-related health issues that
creates a ‘psychologically safe’ feeling to the workers.
Physiological response to heat stress
The manifestations of heat exposures are usually expressed
by the physiological responses, viz., rise in CBT, SwR, and
USG, and the relationship between physiological indica-
tors of heat stress and the associated adverse health risks
are well established (41). The behavioral modifications by
the women in fluid intake and urinating pattern due to
lack of access to toilets also influence the physiological
indicators resulting in consequent health concerns (38).
The significant association observed among the women
who were exposed to heat stress (above TLVs) and
increased SwR �1 L/h (n�9) (t��2.38, p�0.0192)
clearly indicates the progression toward cellular dehydra-
tion (41). The percentage of women in the brick sector
having SwR �1 L/h (14%) and CBT rise above �18C
(17%), compared with steel industry and agriculture
(Table 2), could be attributed to the exposures to intense
heat from the open furnaces in the brick kilns and heavy
workload in addition to the inadequate fluid intake due to

 lack of toilets at work. Although the women in the
steel sector were exposed to higher WBGTs compared
with women in agriculture and brick kilns, the metabolic
workload was partially compensated by automation that
reduced their work intensity. In spite of the sanitation
facilities available in the steel industry, the women with
USGs �1.020 were higher (18%) in the steel sector
compared with the brick and agriculture sectors, which
could be a result of chronic high-heat exposures (radiant
heat) from the furnaces. Research has shown that excessive
sweating and consequent dehydration raises heat strain
(53) and increases the risk of developing heat illness
(47, 54). The increase in SwR can be affected by a number
of factors that include temperature, heat acclimatization,
and type of clothing worn, (55) especially for some of the
women participants who wore multiple layers of clothing
driven by culture and tradition which had an adverse
influence on the heat load imposed on them while working
as it impedes evaporative cooling (56).
Inadequate sanitation facilities and associated risks
In a scenario with lack of access to toilets, the behavioral
modifications in fluid intake and urination pattern of the
women may further increase the risks (32). In this study,
the results of the USG measurement indicate that about
12% of the study population with USG �1.020 may be
dehydrated, a theory that is also strongly supported by
self-reported symptoms suggestive of dehydration (56%).
Reasons that could be attributed for this finding are that
the women did not drink enough fluids to compensate for
the sweat loss due to continuous high-heat exposures,
heavy physical work, and behavioral modification in fluid
intake to avoid using toilets. USG rises with the decrease in
body mass caused by sweat loss and dehydration induced by
heavy physical activity (57�59), and such chronic and
prolonged dehydration will potentially subject the workers
to genitourinary issues including decreased kidney function-
ing/kidney anomalies (60). Dehydration and volume deple-
tion have been cited among major causes of UTIs, AKI, (61)
and increased cardiovascular strain during heat stress (62).
The women workers, who had no access to proper toilet
facilities at their workplaces (agriculture and brick sec-
tors), had reported more heat-related symptoms (n�194)
(x2�4.03, p�0.0444), including dehydration. Water in-
take was minimized, and signals of thirst were ignored

 by the women consciously to avoid frequenting the need
for using a toilet. The significant association seen between
lack of access to toilets and self-reported genitourinary
symptoms (n�174) (x2�42.92, p�0.0005*10�7) stands
as evidence that lack of sanitation facilities is a big concern
for the women and important for their good health (63).
Importance of sanitation facilities at the workplace
Irrespective of the profession, women � whose anatomy
and modesty do not allow them to relieve themselves in
public � have no choice but to wait to relieve themselves
discreetly or until dark, when there is less risk of being
seen or accosted (64) (which is common practice in rural
settings). For protecting women’s safety, dignity, and self-
respect, privacy for sanitation is essential (15, 65) in any
setting, home, or work. Studies show that women eat less
and even drink less to make it easier to ‘hold it’ for a long
time (63), but are unaware that by doing so they may be
subjected to more health risks in future, which is clearly
evidenced in this study (Table 3). The lost wages due to
being away from work that was reported by �10% of the
women during their menstrual period to avoid experien-
cing anxiety of personal hygiene due to lack of access to
toilets will potentially affect their economic status (21)
and increase the psychological stress of discontentment of
their employers. Interventions such as improving the basic
sanitation facilities and reducing heat exposures by simple
techniques will improve health equity because low-income
people generally end up working in jobs in the unpro-
tected informal sector with the greatest health risks (66).
It is essential to urgently address issues, such as lack of
access to toilet facilities at workplaces, which add to the
risk already posed by hot climates for working people.
Good access to toilet facilities for women at the workplace
reduces anxiety and improves the ability to do the work
properly, safely, and with concentration, even during their
menstrual cycle (67).
Although heat and lack of toilets can affect every
worker, the special occupational health and safety needs
of women workers have to be met because they are
‘vulnerable workers’ as classified by the International
Labor Organization (68). Moreover, the expectation for
women to have basic sanitation facilities such as a ‘toilet’ at
the workplace to maintain one’s dignity is not unreason-
able. Meeting this expectation is a ‘win�win’ situation for
the employee and the employer, with public health benefits.
Providing comfortable basic facilities at workplaces will
help attract women for employment, reduce absenteeism,
improve the health andwelfare of the working women, and
protect the public from nuisance and hazards of open
defecation. Dialogs and cooperation between the public
health authorities, non-governmental organizations, wo-
men’s groups, employers, and the labor ministry will set the
stage for the needed change for improved occupational
health of the women in the country.
Strengths and limitations of the study
1. This is the first study to explore the influence of
occupational heat exposures and access to toilet
facilities on women’s health at workplaces in Indian
occupational settings.
2. The findings of the study have important preventive
policy implications for developing countries with
hot climates such as India, where millions of work-
ing women are exposed to the risks of heat stress
and lack of access to toilets at work.
3. The main weakness of this study is that there is no
control group (both with respect to heat exposures
and toilets) to determine if the prevalence is
different in the non-exposed group.
4. No other supportive quantitative data or clinical
records as evidence of health impacts could be
collected from the workers due to unavailability of
those records.
5. This sample is only a very small proportion of the
entire population of working women in the country.
The findings from the study, therefore, cannot be
generalized.
Conclusions
The study demonstrates that women workers who are
exposed to high-heat environments and inadequate sani-
tation facilities at Indian workplaces have significant
risks of heat-related health illnesses and urogenital issues.
This study draws attention to the public health concern
that many workplaces in developing nations still lack
basic sanitation facilities such as toilets. This, combined
with the predicted trends in temperature rise associated
with climate change, could further exacerbate the health
risks for the women, which merit attention. Intervention
studies and further research to strengthen the evidence
are urgently needed to translate the research into effective
prevention policies by joint efforts of the public health
authorities, industries, and labor ministry. Designing
comprehensive gender-sensitive labor policies and work-
place interventions are the need of the hour in order to
avert health risks for millions of women workers, especially
in the developing nations with hot climates.

Paper context
Heat stress and inadequate sanitation facilities are common
risk factors in workplaces in developing countries with
hot climates. Although the impact of heat on health is well
established, the effects of these risk factors on women
workers remain unexplored. Results of this investigation
stand as preliminary evidence of the significant adverse
health implications of these risk factors on the women
workers. Urgent gender-sensitive policy interventions could
avert future health risks and empower women.
