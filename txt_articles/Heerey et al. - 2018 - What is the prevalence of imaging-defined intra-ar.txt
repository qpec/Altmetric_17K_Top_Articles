background Intra-articular hip pathologies are thought 
to be associated with the development of hip and 
groin pain. A better understanding of the relationship 
between symptoms and imaging findings may improve 
the management of individuals with intra-articular hip 
pathologies.
Objective To undertake a systematic review and meta-
analysis to determine the prevalence of intra-articular hip 
pathologies in individuals with and without pain.
Methods Seven electronic databases were searched in 
February 2017 for studies investigating the prevalence 
of intra-articular hip pathologies using MRI, MRA or CT. 
Two independent reviewers conducted the search, study 
selection, quality appraisal and data extraction. Meta-
analysis was performed when studies were deemed 
homogenous, with a strength of evidence assigned to 
pooled results.
Results In general, studies were moderate to high risk 
of bias, with only five studies adjudged to be low risk of 
bias. The 29 studies reporting on the prevalence of intra-
articular hip pathologies identified limited evidence of 
a labral tear prevalence of 62% (95% CI 47% to 75%) 
in symptomatic individuals, with moderate evidence 
identifying a labral tear prevalence of 54% (95% CI 
41% to 66%) in asymptomatic individuals. Limited 
evidence demonstrated a cartilage defect prevalence of 
64% (95% CI 25% to 91%) in symptomatic individuals, 
compared with moderate evidence of a cartilage 
defect prevalence of 12% (95% CI 7% to 21%) in 
asymptomatic individuals.
Conclusion The prevalence of intra-articular hip 
pathologies is highly variable in both symptomatic 
and asymptomatic populations. The prevalence of 
intra-articular hip pathologies appears to be higher in 
symptomatic individuals. However, imaging-defined 
intra-articular hip pathologies are also frequently seen 
in asymptomatic individuals, highlighting a potential 
discordant relationship between imaging pathology and 
pain.

InTROduCTIOn 
Hip and groin pain is a common cause of loss of 
function in young and middle-aged adults.1 2 The 
prevalence of hip and groin pain is known to be 
as high as 49% in athletes and 21% in population 
cohorts.1 3 The occurrence of hip and/or groin 
pain increases with age,3–5 and its impact often 
extends beyond activity reduction, to reduction 
in participation in work and family activities.1 6–9 
Many different structures, sometimes referred to 
as clinical entities, may contribute to the develop-
ment of hip and groin pain.10–14 Imaging is often 
used to assist in the diagnosis of intra-articular and 
extra-articular hip pathology.15–17 With the advent 
of higher-quality imaging, the understanding and 
implications of commonly seen hip morphology 
and pathology requires attention.18 
Surgical management for morphological and 
articular 
pathologies 
has 
increased 
dramati-
cally,19 20 with Montgomery et al20 highlighting a 
365% increase between 2004 and 2009. However, 
some of the articular pathologies targeted by 
surgical management may exist within the ‘normal 
spectrum’ related to age, gender and activity expo-
sure. This concept is evident in a number of other 
anatomical regions, including the knee, shoulder 
and spine.21–25 With imaging findings of intra-ar-
ticular hip pathology in the presence of prolonged 
symptoms being the catalyst for surgical interven-
tions,26 27 it seems prudent to explore the relation-
ship of imaging findings and symptoms. Recent 
reviews have highlighted normal variants of the 
acetabular labrum,28 as well as a high prevalence 
of labral tears in symptomatic and asymptom-
atic subjects.29 30 However, none of these reviews 
aimed to report the prevalence of all intra-articular 
hip pathologies. In addition, a number of relevant 
studies have been published subsequent to these 
reviews. Therefore, the aim of this review was to 
determine the prevalence of intra-articular hip 
pathologies in symptomatic and asymptomatic indi-
viduals irrespective of their sex, age, level of activity 
and presence or absence of radiographic hip osteo-
arthritis (OA).
METhOds
This systematic review was undertaken using the 
preferred reporting guidelines for systematic reviews

Review
(MRI), magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) or computed 
tomography (CT) with or without contrast to investigate the 
presence of intra-articular pathology; and (4) studies that had 
a primary outcome to determine the prevalence of intra-artic-
ular pathologies (including labral tears, cartilage defects, bone 
marrow lesions (BML), ligamentum teres tears and herniation 
pits) or a primary aim to report femoroacetabular impingement 
(FAI) prevalence and intra-articular pathology prevalence. No 
restrictions were placed on the age of study participants. Studies 
were excluded if they (1) reported prevalence of intra-artic-
ular pathology, but it was not the primary aim of the study; (2) 
investigated intra-articular pathology in the following hip condi-
tions: slipped capital femoral epiphysis or Legg-Calve-Perthes 
disease; (3) used other forms of imaging to determine prevalence 
including X-ray, isotopic bone scans and ultrasound; (4) deter-
mined prevalence by arthroscopy or open surgery; (5) included 
less than five participants; (6) were systematic reviews, abstracts 
or unpublished data; and (7) were not published in the English 
language.
search strategy
A systematic search was undertaken using MEDLINE, PubMed, 
CINAHL, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, Scopus and Cochrane data-
bases from inception to 19 May 2016; the search was then 
repeated in its entirety on 27 February 2017. In addition, refer-
ence lists of included articles were screened, and citation tracking 
using Google Scholar was undertaken. The search strategy was 
independently undertaken by two authors (JJH and DMJ) using 
database-specific controlled vocabulary and keyword terms. 
The search strategy for each respective database can be found in 
online supplementary appendix 1.
At completion of database searching, all potentially eligible 
articles were exported into Endnote X7 (Thomson Reuters, 
Carlsbad, California, USA) and duplicates removed. The spec-
ified inclusion/exclusion criteria were independently applied to 
the yield achieved from database and secondary searching by 
two authors (JJH, DMJ). Full-text articles were subsequently 
retrieved and screened independently by each author for eligi-
bility. Final inclusion was determined by each author (JJH, DMJ) 
independently and then a consensus meeting was held to deter-
mine the final list of included articles. If disagreements arose 
in relation to the study’s eligibility, a third reviewer (JLK) was 
consulted to determine eligibility.
Risk of bias
T
wo authors (JJH, DMJ), independently evaluated each eligible 
study for risk of bias using a tool designed for prevalence papers.31 
This tool consists of 10 ‘yes’ or ‘no’ questions that evaluate both 
external (four questions) and internal validity (six questions) 
(table 4), a ‘yes’ is associated with low risk of bias (LR) and a ‘no’ 
with high risk of bias (HR). An article that fails to report suffi-
cient detail to enable scoring for an item is given a ‘no’ which 
equates to HR.31 Modification was made to question seven 
which evaluated the reliability of the imaging modality, with 
an intraclass correlation coefficient >0.40 and Cohen’s kappa 
(ĸ) >40% considered to be LR. At the completion of scoring, 
each article receives an overall risk of bias score based on the 
number of items that demonstrate HR. The articles were then 
grouped into LR (0–3 items), moderate risk (MR) (4–5 items) 
and HR (≥6 items) derived from literature using the same tool 
for risk of bias appraisal.32 If disagreements arose in relation to a 
study's risk of bias, a third independent reviewer (JLK) resolved 
the discrepancy. Inter-rater reliability was evaluated with ĸ, with 
values >80% considered excellent agreement, between 60% and 
80% substantial agreement, 40% and 60% moderate agreement 
and <40% poor to fair agreement.33
data extraction
Data from all 29 articles were independently extracted by two 
authors (JJH, ABM). Consensus meetings were held following 
data extraction of the first 10 articles, and after the completion 
of the 29 articles, to discuss discrepancies in extraction and 
to reach consensus. A third author (KMC) was used to reach 
consensus if discrepancies in data extraction occurred between 
the two authors. If additional data were required, the corre-
sponding authors were contacted. Where two articles reported 
the same data set, the studies were examined for discrepancies 
and the author was contacted if required to seek clarity. The 
extracted data included author, study design, number of study 
participants (and hips), demographics, imaging modality and 
study findings (intra-articular pathology) (tables 1–3).
data synthesis and analysis
In relation to this systematic review, as none of the included 
studies investigated community-based populations, the term 
prevalence was used to define the frequency of intra-articular 
pathologies in each study’s included population. The prevalence 
of intra-articular hip pathology was determined by dividing 
the number of cases by the total number of participants in the 
specified population. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software 
(V
.3.0, Biostat, USA) was used to determine prevalence and 95% 
CIs. Prevalence was presented at a per person level, and if the 
study did not present sufficient information to enable per person 
analysis, prevalence was reported per hip (if the request for per 
person data was not successful). In the event that a study used 
two or more radiologists to evaluate the presence of intra-artic-
ular pathologies, an average prevalence score was determined 
for each of the pathologies reported. Additional intra-articular 
hip pathologies that were only reported in one symptomatic and 
asymptomatic study were displayed in supplementary content. 
Pooled data were presented in per person format, with per hip 
analysis summarised in text, and details presented in the supple-
mentary content.
Primary subgroup analysis occurred on the presence or 
absence of pain. Secondary group analysis was completed on the 
basis of the method used to report prevalence (per person or per 
hip) and imaging modality (MRI, MRA or CT).
Pathology was recorded as present or absent, due to the vari-
ation in assessment, and grading of pathology in the included 
studies. In relation to cartilage defects, only studies that reported 
femoral and acetabular defects together were considered for 
primary analysis. Where studies reported femoral and acetabular 
defects independently, qualitative analysis was undertaken.
Meta-analyses were undertaken only with studies adjudged to 
be LR and MR using a random effects model. High risk of bias 
studies were not included in meta-analyses in line with recent 
recommendations.34 35 Qualitative analyses were undertaken 
when pooling of data was precluded because of clinical hetero-
geneity or if adjudged to be HR. The level of statistical heteroge-
neity for the pooled data was evaluated with Q and I2 statistics.34 
An I2 ≤25% represented low levels of statistical heterogeneity, 
25%–≤50% 
moderate and ≥75% 
high heterogeneity.36 Sensi-
tivity analysis was undertaken first with removal of studies using 
a MRI field strength <1.5 tesla (T) and second in only studies 
using 3 
T MRI.

Review
The strength of evidence for the pooled results of this review 
is based on the original methods advocated by van Tulder et al37 
and later adapted by Rathleff et al.38
Strong evidence: pooled results derived from three or more 
studies, including a minimum of two LR studies, which are statis-
tically homogenous (P>0.05).
Moderate evidence: pooled results derived from multiple 
studies, including at least one LR study, which are statistically 
heterogeneous (P<0.05); or from multiple MR and HR studies 
which are statistically homogenous (P>0.05).
Limited evidence: pooled results from multiple HR or MR 
studies which are statistically heterogeneous (P<0.05).
REsulTs
search results
The review used the PRISMA flow diagram (figure 1).39 In total, 
343 citations were identified through the search strategy. At the 
completion of duplicate removal, 124 citations were screened 
based on title and abstract. The full-text versions of 56 articles 
were retrieved and subsequently assessed for eligibility using the 
inclusion criteria. Four40–43 additional articles were added after 
the screening of reference lists and citation tracking. Thirty-one 
articles were subsequently excluded (online supplementary 
appendix 2), and the remaining 29 articles40–68 were included 
for data analysis (tables 1–3).
Risk of bias within studies
The two reviewers agreed on risk of bias items on 96% of 
occasions (278/290 items), with a ĸ value of 0.84 (95% CI 
0.78 to 0.90) representing excellent agreement.33 Five of the 
29 (17%) included articles were adjudged to be of HR, with 
19 of MR and 5 of LR. All 29 studies had HR for items 1 
and 2, which highlights the disparity of the included study 
populations compared with a general population and the inad-
equacies of the sampling frames used within the studies. In 
addition, inability to demonstrate the reliability of the assess-
ment method used to determine the prevalence of intra-artic-
ular pathology, the use of different imaging methods within 
the one study population and the reporting of prevalence per 
hip instead of per person were other notable sources of bias 
(table 4).
study characteristics
The 29 included studies reported prevalence characteris-
tics on 2573 participants and 4410 hips. Fourteen studies 
(1069 participants, 2662 hips) included only asymptomatic 
participants, with 10 of the studies reporting a mean age 
of <40 years of age (table 1).40 42 46 48–50 52–54 57 59 60 62 64 
Eight studies investigating symptomatic participants used 
MRA to evaluate the prevalence of intra-articular pathology, 
with seven studies reporting a mean age of <40 years of age 
(tables 2 and 3).41 44 45 47 55 61 63 66 Fifteen studies investigated

used in the included studies varied between 0.5 to 3.0 T, 
with one study61 using MRA not reporting the field strength 
 
used.
heterogeneity of included studies
Heterogeneity ranged between 46%–83% and 87%–93% in 
pooled studies investigating the prevalence of labral tears in 
symptomatic and asymptomatic participants, respectively. In 
the studies investigating symptomatic participants with carti-
lage defects, high levels of heterogeneity were observed (98%). 
In studies investigating asymptomatic participants, moderate 
(62%) to high levels (76%) were observed.

remaining two studies (one HR and one MR) reported 
a labral tear prevalence of 89%55 and 48%51 per hip,

alence of 46% (95% CI 24% to 70%) per hip (online supple-
mentary appendix 3 figure 1). The remaining two studies (two

Sensitivity analysis
In symptomatic participants, sensitivity analysis demonstrated 
a pooled labral tear prevalence of 64% (95% CI 59% to 69%; 
Q=0.3; P=0.861; I2=0%) per person in studies using an MRI 
field strength of ≥1.5 
T. Sensitivity analysis was unable to be 
performed for studies using 3 
T MRI due to an insufficient number 
of studies. The labral tear prevalence in asymptomatic participants 
was 56% (95% CI 45% to 67%; Q=55.0; P<0.001; I2=84%) 
per person and 34% (95% CI 17% to 57%; Q=69.8; P<0.001;

Risk of bias items.
1. Was the study’s target population a close representation of the national population in relation to relevant variables, for example, age, sex, occupation?
2. Was the sample frame a true or close representation of the target population?
3. Was some form of random selection used to select the sample, or, was a census taken?
4. Was the likelihood of non-response bias minimal?
5. Were data collected directly from the subjects (as opposed to a proxy)?
6. Was an acceptable case definition used in the study?
7. Was the study instrument that measured the parameter of interest (eg, prevalence of low back pain) shown to have reliability and validity (if necessary)?
8. Was the same mode of data collection used for all subjects?
9. Was the length of the shortest prevalence period for the parameter of interest appropriate?
10. Were the numerator(s) and denominator(s) for the parameter of interest appropriate?
HR, high risk of bias; LR, low risk of bias; MR, moderate risk of bias.

The remaining study66 reported acetabular (23% and 24%) and 
femoral cartilage (10% and 21%) defect prevalence.
Five studies reported prevalence per hip.41 54 55 58 67 One study 
(MR)41 reported a cartilage defect prevalence of 95% in partic-
ipants with FAI. Three (one HR, one MR and one LR) of the 
remaining four studies used a combination of MRI and MRA 
(98%)55 and MRI in isolation (45% and 49%)51 58 to identify 
cartilage defects. The final study (MR)67 reported on acetabular 
(27%) and femoral cartilage defects (7%) in golfers with hip 
pain.
Asymptomatic participants
There was moderate evidence of a pooled cartilage defect preva-
lence of 12% (95% CI 7% to 21%) per person, from five studies 
(one LR and four MR)42 49 53 59 64 using MRI (figure 3). T
wo 
studies (two HR)48 54 reported cartilage defect prevalence per 
person in ice hockey players (18%)48 and high school athletes 
(8%).54 Moderate evidence of a pooled cartilage defect preva-
lence of 33% (95% CI 16% to 56%) per hip was demonstrated 
from two studies (one MR and one LR)51 65 using MRI (online 
supplementary appendix 3 figure 2). One study (HR)54 reported 
a cartilage defect prevalence per hip of 4%. Five studies (one 
HR 
and four MR)40 57 66–68 reported the prevalence of acetabular 
and femoral cartilage defects independently. Acetabular cartilage 
defect prevalence was reported per person (2%–35%)40 66 68 and 
per hip (1% and 6%),57 67 with femoral cartilage defects identi-
fied at per person (2%–48%)40 66 68 and per hip level (1% and 
3%).57 67
Sensitivity analysis
In symptomatic participants, sensitivity analysis demonstrated 
a pooled cartilage defect prevalence of 52% (95% CI 12% to 
90%; Q=57.6; P<0.001; I2=98%) per person. No sensitivity 
analysis was performed for studies using 3 
T MRI due to an 
insufficient number of studies. In asymptomatic participants, 
a cartilage defect prevalence of 13% (95% CI 8% to 20%; 
Q=11.7; P=0.070; I2=49%) per person and 22% (95% CI 7% 
to 50%; Q=11.5 P=0.003; I2=83%) per hip was identified in 
studies using an MRI field strength of ≥1.5 
T. In studies only 
using 3 
T MRI, a cartilage defect prevalence of 15% (95% CI 9% 
to 23%; Q=9.2; P=0.055; I2=57%) was demonstrated, with 
no analysis undertaken at per hip level due to an insufficient 
number of studies.

dIsCussIOn
Imaging-defined intra-articular hip pathologies are frequently 
observed in individuals with and without pain. Diagnostic 
imaging is now readily used to assist in the evaluation of individ-
uals with hip and groin conditions.10 17 However, there is often 
a poor association between hip symptoms and structural changes 
seen on imaging.69 In total, 29 studies were analysed in this 
review, with 24 studies adjudged to have moderate to high risk 
of bias. The external validity of the included studies is generally 
limited, with no studies investigating large population cohorts. 
High levels of statistical heterogeneity (I2 ≥75%) were consis-
tently observed within MRI and MRA studies highlighting that

Review
considerable variability exists in the prevalence of intra-articular 
pathologies in the studies included in this review. The results of 
this review provide a greater understanding of the prevalence of 
commonly seen hip pathologies in relation to the presence or 
absence of pain. In summary, labral tears are prevalent in both 
symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, although the preva-
lence is slightly higher in symptomatic groups. Importantly, the 
prevalence of cartilage defects, BML and ligamentum teres tears 
was higher in symptomatic than asymptomatic groups.
Labral tears were observed in 62% of individuals with pain 
and 54% of asymptomatic individuals. The high prevalence of 
labral tears in asymptomatic individuals is a particularly inter-
esting finding, given the reported nociceptive ability of labral 
tissue70 71 and its proposed role in hip joint health.72 73 The 
questionable relationship between labral pathology and symp-
toms identified in this review has been mirrored recently in 
two papers74 75 reporting a limited association between labral 
pathology and self-reported function in a chronic hip pain popu-
lation and individuals with and without radiographic hip OA. 
The role that labral tissue plays in the development of symptoms 
appears more complex than previously thought.
Cartilage defects were evident in 64% of symptomatic indi-
viduals, considerably more than the 12% of asymptomatic indi-
viduals. Thus, it could be considered that cartilage defects might 
contribute to hip-related symptoms. However, recent work has 
highlighted a variable relationship between cartilage defects and 
pain.74–76 Moreover, articular cartilage is considered to be aneural 
under normal physiological conditions.77 78 Interestingly, of the 
included studies that reported acetabular and femoral cartilage 
defects independently, a trend highlighting a greater prevalence 
of acetabular cartilage defects was observed in symptomatic indi-
viduals. Our finding is consistent with studies reporting asso-
ciations between acetabular cartilage damage and pain, clinical 
symptoms and reduction in function.74 The presence of cartilage 
defects could indicate early stages of the arthritic cascade, and 
the involvement of other tissues such as periarticular tissues, 
subchondral bone or synovial tissue.71 74 78 79
This review also highlighted variability in prevalence of herni-
ation pits between those with and without pain. Studies using 
MRI demonstrated a greater prevalence in symptomatic individ-
uals, conversely studies using CT identified a greater prevalence 
in asymptomatic individuals. Paralabral cysts were identified 
similarly in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in studies 
using MRA and MRI, respectively. However, akin to carti-
lage defects, ligamentum teres tears and BML were seen more 
often in those with pain. Variability has been observed within 
literature regarding the nociceptive ability of the ligamentum 
teres.71 80 This lack of consensus is reflected in our results, with 
a quarter of asymptomatic individuals having imaging defined 
pathology. A greater understanding of the role of ligamentum 
teres in nociception is required to inform management decisions. 
The greater prevalence of BML observed in symptomatic popu-
lations is congruent with recent findings showing the association 
of such lesions with clinical symptoms and impaired patient-re-
ported outcomes.74 75 81 In addition, individuals with acetabular 
and femoral cartilage defects have a greater prevalence of BML, 
which may demonstrate an association between such defects and 
early arthritic change.74
T
wo recent reviews29 30 have reported on the prevalence of 
intra-articular hip pathologies. The review undertaken by Frank 
et al30 reported a higher prevalence of labral tears in asymptom-
atic individuals (68% 
vs 54%), which likely reflects the 11 new 
studies published since the completion of their literature search, 
and our decision to distinguish the prevalence of pathologies by 
either person or hip. The review by Mascarenhas et al29 reported 
on labral tears and cartilage defects in symptomatic, asymptom-
atic and athletic individuals. The prevalence of labral tears in 
symptomatic individuals was lower than our results (28% vs 
62%). The variation in results can be explained through the 
differences seen in review aims, methods used to combine prev-
alence figures and the large variation in studies included in each 
review.
The findings of our review should be interpreted in conjunc-
tion with the known limitations of diagnostic imaging. In partic-
ular, we highlighted that labral tears were observed on MRI in a 
high number of asymptomatic individuals (54%). Magnetic reso-
nance imaging across various field strengths with and without 
the use of contrast agents has variable diagnostic utility to iden-
tify labral pathology,18 82 which may result in overestimation 
or underestimation of prevalence in asymptomatic individuals. 
However, 4 of the 8 studies included in meta-analysis used 3 
T 
MRI, which may provide greater accuracy compared with lower 
field strength systems83 and increases confidence in our find-
ings. Contrast-enhanced MRA provides the highest diagnostic 
accuracy in the identification of labral tears. Unfortunately, no 
studies including MRA on asymptomatic individuals were iden-
tified in this review. Further studies are necessary to determine 
whether MRA findings of labral tears in asymptomatic individ-
uals agree with the current analysis. The disparity in cartilage 
defects is a notable result, with this trend observed in studies 
using MRA and MRI. The use of low-field strength MRA proto-
cols across the studies included in meta-analysis increases the 
possibility of misinterpretation of cartilage defects in symptom-
atic individuals. Conversely, a number of studies used 3 
T MRI 
for analysis of cartilage defects in symptomatics and consistently 
demonstrated a higher prevalence. As 3 
T MRI provides greater 
visualisation of acetabular and femoral articular cartilage,83 84 it 
may be that the prevalence of cartilage defects is indeed higher 
in symptomatic individuals.
The decision to dichotomise the imaging findings may have 
resulted in an overestimation of prevalence. However, this 
method was deemed necessary due to the variability in methods 
used to grade intra-articular pathology.75 76 The recent devel-
opment of semiquantitative methods for the assessment of hip 
structural pathologies has shown promise with high levels of 
reliability and agreement.75 76 Furthermore, these methods have 
shown moderate correlation with patient-reported outcome 
measures.76 Future research should focus on developing 
consensus for the grading of intra-articular pathologies as this 
will provide a better understanding of the true spectrum of 
pathology.
In total, 5 of the 29 included studies were adjudged to 
have HR, highlighting poor study methodology in the current 
literature evaluating the prevalence of intra-articular hip 
pathologies. Study populations were often attained by conve-
nience and not deemed representative of a wider population, 
reducing the generalisability of the reviews findings. The reli-
ability and level of agreement for the diagnostic criteria used 
to evaluate intra-articular pathologies were often not docu-
mented in studies, reducing confidence in the reported find-
ings. The method used to determine prevalence was variable 
across studies. Prevalence by definition should be determined 
by dividing ‘the number of cases of a disease in a popula-
tion, by the population number’.85 Our decision to adjudge 
studies reporting prevalence per hip as high risk of bias was 
in line with recent literature.86 Exclusion of HR studies in 
the meta-analyses may increase confidence in the findings of 
this review. However, limited to moderate-level evidence was

Review
assigned with our findings, outlining that studies of greater 
methodological quality are still required.
The high levels of heterogeneity observed in the pooled symp-
tomatic and asymptomatic populations are akin to other prev-
alence reviews.24 87 In relation to this review, it likely reflects 
variability in imaging modalities and parameters used across the 
included studies. Other sources of heterogeneity may include 
variations in age, sex and levels of physical activity across the 
included studies. Interestingly, high levels of heterogeneity were 
present despite the exclusion of HR studies, which may indicate 
that study quality and heterogeneity are not directly related in 
this review.
limitations
There are a number of limitations relating to the results of this 
review. First, the decision to exclude studies investigating the 
prevalence of intra-articular hip pathologies in individuals with 
slipped capital femoral epiphysis and Legg-Calve-Perthes disease 
reduces the generalisability of our findings specifically to these 
conditions. Second, a number of studies were excluded on the 
basis of not identifying a primary aim of reporting the preva-
lence of intra-articular hip pathologies.88–91 While excluded, the 
results from the aforementioned studies are very similar to those 
achieved in our review, providing validation of the results of 
this review. Third, unpublished studies and those not published 
in the English language were not included in this review which 
may have excluded some relevant studies. A notable limitation 
of the studies in this review is the inclusion of participants based 
on the presence of hip and/or groin pain. Hip and groin-related 
pain can be caused by a number of different intra-articular and 
extra-articular conditions,10 13 14 hence the relevance of imag-
ing-defined intra-articular pathologies may be questionable in 
some symptomatic individuals.
Importantly, the studies in this review evaluate highly selective 
populations, meaning the results of this review are not inter-
pretable beyond the inclusion criteria of the included studies. 
Furthermore, there is limited comparability between the included 
studies which further reduces the generalisability of the reviews 
findings. Consideration is needed regarding the use of the term 
‘prevalence’ to describe the findings of this review as none of 
the included studies evaluated community-based populations. 
Finally, the intra-articular pathologies identified with imaging 
in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals were not 
confirmed by hip arthroscopy, which is currently considered the 
gold standard for diagnosis of intra-articular hip pathologies. 
Although this is a notable limitation, arthroscopic confirmation 
of intra-articular pathologies will never be a consideration in 
asymptomatic populations.
COnClusIOn
This systematic review identified 29 studies. The included studies 
used MRI, MRA and CT to investigate the prevalence of intra-ar-
ticular hip pathologies. Most studies had a moderate to high risk 
of bias with only five low-risk studies. The prevalence of carti-
lage pathology is higher in people with pain than those without. 
In contrast, the prevalence of labral pathology is similar in those 
with and without pain. Bone marrow lesions and ligamentum 
teres tears appear to be more prevalent in individuals with pain. 
Paralabral cysts and herniation pits are prevalent in both symp-
tomatic and asymptomatic individuals. This review highlights 
the uncertainty of the relationship between intra-articular hip 
joint pathology on imaging and pain. A greater understanding 
of this relationship may improve the selection and effectiveness 
of conservative and surgical interventions for intra-articular hip 
pathologies.

What is already known?
 
► Diagnostic imaging is used to evaluate the cause of 
symptoms in individuals with hip, groin or buttock pain.
 
► Intra-articular hip pathologies found on imaging are often a 
catalyst for surgical interventions in those with hip, groin or 
buttock pain.
 
► The prevalence of pathological findings has been shown to 
be high in those with and without pain in other anatomical 
regions.
What are the new findings?
 
► Labral tear prevalence is high in those with and without hip, 
groin or buttock pain.
 
► Cartilage defects are seen more often in individuals with 
pain.
 
► Bone marrow lesions and ligamentum teres tears are more 
prevalent in individuals with pain.
 
► Herniation pits and paralabral cysts are seen at similar rates 
in individuals with and without pain.
 
► Uncertainty surrounds the relationship between imaging-
defined intra-articular pathology and pain.
 
► Studies evaluating true community-based populations are 
needed to better understand the true prevalence of intra-
articular hip pathologies in asymptomatic and symptomatic 
individuals.
