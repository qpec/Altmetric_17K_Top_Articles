IMPORTANCE The public health implications of e-cigarettes depend, in part, on whether
e-cigarette use affects the risk of cigarette smoking.
OBJECTIVE To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies that
assessed initial use of e-cigarettes and subsequent cigarette smoking.
DATA SOURCES PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, the 2016 Society for
Research on Nicotine and Tobacco 22nd Annual Meeting abstracts, the 2016 Society of
Behavioral Medicine 37th Annual Meeting & Scientific Sessions abstracts, and the 2016
National Institutes of Health Tobacco Regulatory Science Program Conference were searched
between February 7 and February 17, 2017. The search included indexed terms and text words
to capture concepts associated with e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes in articles
published from database inception to the date of the search.
STUDY SELECTION Longitudinal studies reporting odds ratios for cigarette smoking initiation
associated with ever use of e-cigarettes or past 30-day cigarette smoking associated with
past 30-day e-cigarette use. Searches yielded 6959 unique studies, of which 9 met inclusion
criteria (comprising 17 389 adolescents and young adults).
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Study quality and risk of bias were assessed using the
Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions
tool, respectively. Data and estimates were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Among baseline never cigarette smokers, cigarette smoking
initiation between baseline and follow-up. Among baseline non–past 30-day cigarette
smokers who were past 30-day e-cigarette users, past 30-day cigarette smoking at follow-up.
RESULTS Among17 389adolescentsandyoungadults,theagesrangedbetween14and30years

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE e-Cigarette use was associated with greater risk for
subsequent cigarette smoking initiation and past 30-day cigarette smoking. Strong
e-cigarette regulation could potentially curb use among youth and possibly limit the future
population-level burden of cigarette smoking.

 T
he prevalence of e-cigarette use has risen rapidly since
introductionofthisproducttotheUnitedStatesin2007.
Among US high school students, the prevalence of past
30-day use of e-cigarettes increased 10-fold from 1.5% in 2011
to 16.0% in 2015, when the prevalence of past 30-day e-
cigarette use in this population exceeded its prevalence of past
30-day cigarette smoking (9.3%).1 e-Cigarette use occurs at an
appreciable prevalence among both cigarette-smoking and
never cigarette-smoking youth.2-4 Furthermore, longitudinal
studies5-10 have reported that e-cigarette use is associated with
an increased risk of cigarette smoking initiation among never
cigarette-smoking adolescents and young adults even after ad-
justing for known demographic, psychosocial, and behav-
ioral risk factors. Recently, the US Surgeon General noted this
increased risk as an important public health concern.11
Although some studies suggest that the use of e-cigarettes
may help adults quit smoking,12 e-cigarettes may confer a pub-
lichealthharmiftheiruseleadstoasubstantially(1)greaternum-
ber of youth who initiate cigarette smoking compared with the

portant to obtain generalizable estimates of these 2 risks to es-
tablish the potential public health influence of e-cigarette use
among adolescents and young adults.11 Therefore, we con-
ducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis to date of
longitudinalstudiestoobtaingeneralizableestimatesofriskfor
cigarette smoking associated with e-cigarette use across a wide
range of populations, study settings, and confounding demo-
graphic, psychosocial, and behavioral influences. We followed
the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology
(MOOSE) guidelines for our systematic review.

Study Selection
We included studies that evaluated the association between
e-cigarette use among never cigarette smokers at baseline and
cigarette smoking initiation between baseline and follow-up
(Figure 1). We also included studies that evaluated the associa-
tionbetweenpast30-daye-cigaretteuseatbaselineandpast30-
day cigarette smoking at follow-up. We included longitudinal
studies and excluded cross-sectional studies given the tempo-
ral ordering of the research question. Three investigators (S.S.,
J.Y.,andR.D.)independentlyreviewedthetitle,abstract,andtext

Key Points
Question Is there an association between e-cigarette use and
cigarette smoking among adolescents and young adults?
Finding A systematic review and meta-analysis showed strong
and consistent evidence of an association between initial
e-cigarette use and subsequent cigarette smoking initiation, as
well as between past 30-day e-cigarette use and subsequent past
30-day cigarette smoking.
Meaning To minimize the potential public health harm from
e-cigarette use, the US Food and Drug Administration, as well as
state and local agencies, will need to engage in effective regulatory
actions to discourage youths’use of e-cigarettes and prevent the
transition from e-cigarettes to other combustible tobacco products.

main of either the NOS or the ROBINS-I tool, they discussed to
reach consensus based on the rubrics.
Statistical Analysis
Wecalculatedtheobservedprobabilityofcigarettesmokingini-
tiation among baseline never cigarette smokers by their base-
line e-cigarette use. We then calculated the corresponding un-
adjustedoddsratiousingdataacrossallincludedstudies.Next,
we estimated the pooled odds ratio for cigarette smoking ini-
tiation among baseline ever e-cigarette users compared with
never e-cigarette users by fitting a random-effects meta-
analysis model. The meta-analysis model included as data the
multivariable regression results of each study that adjusted for
known demographic, psychosocial, and behavioral risk fac-
tors for cigarette smoking.
Similarly,wecalculatedtheobservedprobabilityofpast30-
day (“current”) cigarette smoking at follow-up among baseline
noncurrent cigarette smokers by their baseline use of e-
cigarettesinthepast30days.Wethenfitarandom-effectsmeta-
analysismodeltoestimatethepooledoddsratioforcurrentciga-
rettesmokingatfollow-upamongbaselinenoncurrentcigarette

baseline noncurrent cigarette smokers who did not use
e-cigarettes in the past 30 days. The meta-analysis model also
includedasdatathemultivariableregressionresultsofeachstudy
that adjusted for known risk factors for cigarette smoking.
For both analyses, we assessed statistical heterogeneity
using the I2 statistic, which measures the percentage of total
variation due to heterogeneity among studies rather than by
chance.17 For the cigarette smoking initiation analysis, we then
assessed the source of heterogeneity between studies by con-
ducting subgroup analysis. We consider the following sub-
groups: adolescent vs young adult studies (based on the mean
age of respondents at baseline), baseline year of study (before
2014 vs 2014 or later), and regional vs national sample. We se-
lected 2014 as the cut point for the subgroup because youths’
past 30-day e-cigarette use after 2013 grew substantially.1
We conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess the influence
ofselectionbias(eg,publicationbias)onthepooledadjustedodds

 adults) and were included in the systematic review and meta-
analysis (Figure 1). Seven studies5-10,22 examined cigarette
smoking initiation between baseline and follow-up and in-
cluded a total of 8168 participants who were never cigarette
smokers at baseline (of whom 1174 were ever e-cigarette us-
ers at baseline). Two studies23,24 examined past 30-day ciga-
rette smoking and included a total of 2084 participants who
were not past 30-day cigarette smokers at baseline (of whom
119werepast30-daye-cigaretteusersatbaseline).Baselineand
follow-up data were collected between 2012 and 2016 for these
studies (Table 1). The age of participants across studies ranged
between 14 and 30 years old at baseline, and 56.0% were fe-
male. The setting of 5 studies5,7-9,23 was regional (3 in the Los
Angeles, California, area; 1 in Oahu, Hawaii; and 1 in Rich-
mond, Virginia), while the remaining 4 studies6,10,22,24 were
USnational-basedsamplesrecruitedthroughrandom-digitdial
(2 studies), nationally representative online panels (1 study),
andnationalrepresentativeschool-basedsamples(1study).All
studies adjusted for demographic, psychosocial, and behav-
ioral risk factors that could be correlated with e-cigarette use
and cigarette smoking. Three studies5,9,23 received a score of
6 of 9 on the NOS, and the remaining 6 studies6-8,10,22,24 re-
ceived a score of 5 of 9 on the NOS (score range, 0-9; eTable 6
in the Supplement). In addition, the overall risk of bias was
moderate for all studies based on the ROBINS-I tool (eTable 7
in the Supplement).
Among baseline never cigarette smokers, the unadjusted
odds ratio for cigarette smoking initiation ranged between 2.65
and6.23acrossstudiesforthosewhohadevertriede-cigarettes
comparedwiththosewhohadnevertriede-cigarettes(Figure2).
Pooling across the 7 studies5-10,22 that examined initiation, the
probabilitiesofcigarettesmokinginitiationwere23.2%forbase-
lineevere-cigaretteusersand7.2%forbaselinenevere-cigarette
users, for an unadjusted odds ratio of 3.83 (95% CI, 3.74-3.91).
Combiningthedataandmultivariableregressionresultsfromthe
7studiesinarandom-effectsmeta-analysis,thepooledadjusted
odds ratio for subsequent cigarette smoking initiation was 3.50
(95%CI,2.38-5.16)forbaselineevere-cigaretteuserscompared
with baseline never e-cigarette users.
Among baseline noncurrent cigarette smokers, the unad-
justed odds ratio for current cigarette smoking at follow-up
ranged between 4.71 and 11.18 across studies for those who had
used e-cigarettes in the past 30 days at baseline compared with
thosewhohadnotusede-cigarettesinthepast30daysatbase-
line(Figure3).Poolingacrossbothstudies23,24thatexaminedcur-
rent cigarette smoking, the probabilities of current cigarette
smoking at follow-up were 21.5% for baseline past 30-day
e-cigarette users and 4.6% for baseline non–past 30-day
e-cigarette users, for an unadjusted odds ratio of 5.68 (95% CI,
3.49-9.24).Combiningthedataandmultivariableregressionre-
sults from the 2 studies in a random-effects meta-analysis, the
pooled adjusted odds ratio for past 30-day cigarette smoking at
follow-up was 4.28 (95% CI, 2.52-7.27) for baseline past 30-day
e-cigarette users compared with baseline non–past 30-day
e-cigarette users.
We observed evidence of moderate heterogeneity (Coch-
ran Q) in the 7 studies5-10,22 of cigarette smoking initiation
(Q6 = 13.79,P = .03,I2 = 56%).Adolescent-basedstudies5,7,8 (ie,
the mean age of respondents at baseline <18 years) exhibited
greaterheterogeneitythanyoungadult–basedstudies6,9,10,22(ie,
themeanageofrespondentsatbaseline≥18years)(Table2).Af-
ter excluding the 3 adolescent-based studies, the pooled ad-
justed odds ratio for cigarette smoking initiation was 4.11 (95%
CI, 2.63-6.41), and this exclusion diminished the heterogeneity
among the studies, which was no longer statistically signifi-
cant (P = .67). Similarly, after excluding the 4 studies5-7,22 con-
ducted before 2014, the pooled adjusted odds ratio of cigarette
smokinginitiationwas4.48(95%CI,3.06-6.57),andthisexclu-
siondiminishedtheheterogeneityamongthestudies,whichwas
no longer statistically significant (P = .37). Finally, after exclud-
ing the 4 regional-based studies,5,7-9 the pooled adjusted odds
ratio of cigarette smoking initiation was 5.64 (95% CI, 2.76-
11.54), and this exclusion diminished the heterogeneity among
thestudies,whichwasnolongerstatisticallysignificant(P = .84).
We conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess the influ-
enceofselectionbiasonthepooledadjustedoddsratioforciga-
rettesmokinginitiationbyfittingaCopasselectionmodel(eAp-
pendix, eFigure 3, eTable 8, and eTable 9 in the Supplement).
Adjusting for selection bias, the Copas selection model esti-
mated that the pooled adjusted odds ratio for cigarette smok-
ing initiation was 3.16 (95% CI, 2.14-4.66) compared with the
random-effects model estimate of 3.50 (95% CI, 2.38-5.16).
Discussion
Inthissystematicreviewandmeta-analysis,resultsfrom9lon-
gitudinalstudieswereconsistentinfindingthate-cigaretteuse
is associated with an increased risk of future cigarette smok-
ing initiation and current cigarette smoking even after adjust-
ing for potentially confounding demographic, psychosocial,
and behavioral risk factors. The source of data from each study
appears in eTable 10 in the Supplement. Our results suggest
that e-cigarette use is a strong risk factor for cigarette smok-
ing among adolescents and young adults because the magni-
tude of the pooled odds ratios approximately equaled or ex-
ceeded that of other known risk factors, including parental,
sibling, and peer cigarette smoking and high levels of sensa-
tion seeking and risk taking.25,26 Our results indicate that e-
cigarette use is an independent risk factor for cigarette smok-
ing because we included studies that adjusted for numerous
known risk factors for cigarette smoking in our analysis.
e-Cigarette use may represent a risk factor for cigarette
smoking initiation and current cigarette smoking for several
behavioral and physiological reasons. First, e-cigarette use
mimics the behavioral scripts of cigarette smoking. The use
of e-cigarettes involves hand-to-mouth movements, puffing
(which brings the e-cigarette aerosol into the mouth), inhala-
tion of the mixture into the lungs, and exhalation.6 For ex-
ample,thesameexhalationtechniquesusedtoproducesmoke
rings with traditional cigarettes can be used to make rings of
aerosol with e-cigarettes.27 Therefore, adolescents and young
adults,eventhosewhoprimarilyusee-cigaretteswithoutnico-
tine, may acquire and learn cigarette smoking–related behav-
ioralscriptsthroughtheuseofe-cigarettesthatultimatelymake
the transition to cigarette smoking more natural.

 gas chromatography and mass spectrometry revealed sub-
stantial discrepancies between reported and actual nicotine
content. In addition, inhaling pleasurable flavors may pro-
vide a positive sensory experience similar to smokers’re-
ports about inhaling cigarette smoke.
Third, e-cigarette use may activate cognitive or behav-
ioral processes that increase the risk of smoking. For ex-
ample, e-cigarette users show increases in positive expectan-
cies about cigarette smoking and increases in affiliation with
peers who smoke cigarettes.32 These cognitive and behav-
ioral effects may operate independent of other processes to in-
crease the risk of smoking among adolescents who try e-
cigarettes.
Whethere-cigarettesrepresentapublichealthharmorben-
efit depends, in part, on the number of adolescents and young
adults who initiate cigarette smoking after the use of e-
cigarettesandiftheseindividualswouldlikelyhavebegunciga-
rette smoking in the absence of e-cigarettes. Although some
modelssuggestthate-cigaretteuseismerelyamarkerforhigh-
risk adolescents who would have smoked cigarettes anyway,14
empirical evidence indicates that e-cigarette use differen-
tially occurs among youth who are not at high risk for ciga-
rette smoking based on established risk factors.4,5,33 For ex-
ample, Wills et al34 found that the effect of e-cigarette use on
cigarette smoking initiation was stronger among study par-
ticipants who were at lower risk at baseline on 3 indexes for
smoking compared with those who were at higher risk. Bar-
rington-Trimis et al8 similarly found that the effect of e-
cigarette use on cigarette smoking initiation was stronger for
youth who were not susceptible to cigarette smoking com-
pared with youth who were susceptible to cigarette smoking.
Therefore, e-cigarette use does not appear to be just a marker
for high-risk youth; rather, e-cigarette use is a true risk factor
for cigarette smoking initiation.34 If, indeed, e-cigarette use in-
creases the likelihood of subsequent cigarette smoking initia-
tion among otherwise low-risk adolescents, then the use of e-
cigarettes could slow or reverse the decline in adolescent
cigarette smoking that has occurred since 1996.35
Strengths and Limitations
We note several strengths of this research for addressing the
possibilitythate-cigaretteuseisariskfactorforcigarettesmok-
ing. First, all of the included studies were longitudinal; hence,
e-cigarette use temporally preceded cigarette smoking initia-
tionandpast30-daycigarettesmoking.Second,poolingacross
studies, all of which adjusted for numerous covariates, we
found substantial effect sizes of e-cigarette use on cigarette
smoking initiation and current cigarette smoking. Third, the
studiesoccurredoverashortperiod(2012-2016);therefore,the
level of external risk factors (eg, price of cigarettes) remained
constant. Fourth, we found consistent evidence across mul-
tiple studies that e-cigarette use increased the risk of ciga-
rette smoking initiation. Perhaps more concerning from a pub-
lic health perspective, we also found evidence that e-cigarette
use increased the risk of subsequent past 30-day cigarette
smoking, which includes regular daily cigarette smoking.
Therefore, several aspects of the association between e-
cigarette use and cigarette smoking suggest a causal correla-
tion, namely, its association, consistency, specificity, tempo-
rality, and biological and behavioral plausibility.
We also note several limitations. First, the overall risk of
bias was moderate for all studies because, in part, the risk of
bias due to confounding was moderate. All studies accounted
forvaryingdemographic,psychosocial,andbehavioralriskfac-
tors,althoughthepotentialexistsforomittedvariablebias.The
overall quality of 6 studies6-8,10,22,24 was reduced because of
loss to follow-up that each exceeded 20%. The association be-
tween e-cigarette use and cigarette smoking may be biased if
respondents lost to follow-up were more or less likely to smoke
cigarettes at follow-up than respondents not lost to follow-
up. Of the 6 studies, 4 studies6-8,10 with high loss to follow-up
compared complete case and full information analysis, as-
sessed whether the association between e-cigarette use and
cigarette smoking differed by characteristics associated with
attrition (eg, highest parental educational level), and either
stratified analysis based on characteristics associated with at-
trition or reweighted the sample based on attrition. The sub-
stantive conclusions remained the same. Second, we do not
know the type of e-cigarette used by respondents or the pro-
portion of respondents who used nicotine-containing e-
cigarettes. Later-generation e-cigarettes (eg, “mods”) deliver
higher blood nicotine levels than first-generation e-
cigarettes (eg, “cig-a-likes”).36-38 Third, although we con-
ducted an international literature search, all included studies
were US based; therefore, our results may not apply to youth
in other countries. Fourth, 2 studies5,8 sampled students from
Los Angeles–area high schools, although there was no over-
lap in the cohorts.
Finally, the studies ascertained mainly early phases of the
adolescent smoking process. No study followed up youth long
enough to determine the proportion of onset cases who be-
came regular or nicotine-dependent cigarette smokers dur-
ing the follow-up period.5-8,22 However, it should be noted that
studies39-44ofsmokingtransitionshaveconsistentlyfoundthat
early symptoms of nicotine dependence (eg, craving a ciga-
rette) can emerge only a short time after onset, sometimes af-
ter an adolescent has smoked only a few cigarettes, and that
theseearlysymptomsarestrongpredictorsofsubsequenttran-
sition to full nicotine dependence. Therefore, from a public
health standpoint, there does not seem to be a clear lower
threshold for concern with respect to frequency or quantity
smoked. For example, DiFranza et al noted that based on their
data “First inhalation [of a cigarette] is the most important to-
bacco use milestone.”41(p208)
Conclusions
Our systematic review and meta-analysis of 9 longitudinal
studies found consistent and strong evidence that e-cigarette
use is associated with increased odds of subsequent cigarette
smoking initiation and current cigarette smoking among ado-
lescents and young adults after adjusting for known demo-
graphic, psychosocial, and behavioral risk factors. To mini-
mize the potential public health harm from e-cigarette use, the

 agencies, will need to engage in regulatory actions to discour-
age youth use of e-cigarettes and prevent the transition from
e-cigarettes to other combustible tobacco products. In addi-
tion to the currently enacted age limitations on in-store sales,
regulatory actions could include restrictions on advertising
campaigns that may be viewed by adolescents, limits to char-
acterizing flavors (eg, fruit- and candy-flavored e-cigarettes),
strict standards for reporting actual nicotine content in e-
liquid, and requirements for age verification for online and re-
tail sales of these products. Such strong regulation of e-
cigarettes could curb use among youth and limit the future
population-level burden of tobacco.
