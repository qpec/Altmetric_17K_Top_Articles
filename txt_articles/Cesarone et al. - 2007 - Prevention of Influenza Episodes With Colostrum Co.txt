 of influenza are well defined,1,2 a significant num-
ber of influenza-associated hospitalization occur
among the elderly3 and in children.3,4
The occurrence of new “drift”5 or a new
emerging virus6 may reduce the cost-effective per-
formance of vaccines and antiviral drugs, however,
and the impact of vaccination benefit sometimes is
considered to be overestimated.7,8 New prevention
tools should be available that may improve the
defense against the virus that causes flu. One of
these could be colostrum.
Colostrum is produced by the mammary gland
within 48 to 73 hours after the birth of offspring. This
period is so significant to ensure a correct immuno-
logic status that without colostrum, many newborn
mammals do not survive. Human colostrum is an
important source of proteins, fats, carbohydrates,
and vitamins and minerals, and includes several bio-
logically active molecules essential for immunity
,
Influenza (flu) causes many deaths and a large
amount of costs worldwide. Vaccines standardized
to contain hemoagglutinin protein of different
viruses and antiviral drugs are available for its pro-
phylaxis or treatment. These products are aimed
mainly at the prevention of serious consequences,
including hospitalization and death, that affect par-
ticularly the weaker members of the population
such as children, individuals aged 65 years and
older, and patients debilitated with chronic disease.

The efficacy of a 2-month treatment with oral colostrum in
the prevention of flu episodes compared with anti-
influenza vaccination was evaluated. Groups included
healthy subjects without prophylaxis and those receiving
both vaccination and colostrum. After 3 months of follow-
up, the number of days with flu was 3 times higher in the
non-colostrum subjects. The colostrum group had 13
episodes versus 14 in the colostrum + vaccination group, 41
in the group without prophylaxis, and 57 in nontreated
subjects. Part 2 of the study had a similar protocol with 65
very high-risk cardiovascular subjects, all of whom had
prophylaxis. The incidence of complications and hospital
admission was higher in the group that received only a vac-
cination compared with the colostrum groups. Colostrum,
both in healthy subjects and high-risk cardiovascular
patients, is at least 3 times more effective than vaccination
to prevent flu and is very cost-effective.

 PREVENTION OF INFLUENZA WITH COLOSTRUM
131
such as immunoglobulins (Ig) and growth factors.
For several reasons, however, human colostrum is
not easily available, storable, or usable as a supple-
ment. Bovine colostrum is the most common source
as food supplement. Despite the lack of a defined
composition profile and fluctuation of Ig titer, all
types of bovine colostrum contain neutralizing Ig
against pathogens.9
Factors present both in bovine and human
colostrum, even though not identical are compara-
ble, and most elements are present in higher quan-
tities and concentrations in bovine colostrum. In
general, the specific antibodies found in colostrum
include those for Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp,
Streptococcus spp, Helicobacter pylori, Candida spp,
rotavirus, and other common pathogens.10 Some
clinical studies have already shown that colostrum
includes factors that are able to reduce chronic
diarrhea in immunodeficient subjects,11,12 diarrhea
caused by rotavirus in children,13 and improve
symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections in
adults.14
The aim of this study was the evaluation of
the use of oral colostrum in preventing flu
episodes linked to winter compared with anti-flu
vaccination, and also the consideration of a com-
parable group subjects using no prophylaxis. The
colostrum used was derived from nonimmunized
animals and characterized by a standardized
composition, and results obtained in this study
cannot necessarily be produced by all types of
colostrum. Also, a high-risk group with cardio-
vascular problems was included because an
episode of flu in these subjects can easily become
severe and severely increase morbidity and even
mortality.
METHODS AND MATERIALS
Study Design
Subjects analyzed in this study were evaluated
within the framework of the epidemiologic screen-
ing project (PAP/PEA) in San Valentino, Vasto, and
Spoltore (Abruzzo, Italy), which repeats⎯with differ-
ent characteristics, being based on high-resolution
ultrasound imaging of the arterial wall⎯the frame-
work of the Framingham Study. The PAP/PEA study,
in its 12th year of activity, includes constant contact
with the subjects in the local populations that are
being evaluated, which is ideal for this type of mon-
itoring study. The study was performed as a clinical
registry trial.
Patients
Inclusion Criteria
In Part 1 of the study, 144 healthy individuals
of both sexes (age range, 30 to 80 years) were
included and divided in 4 groups. Two similar
groups were formed by subjects who underwent flu
vaccination within 2 weeks before the inclusion:
one group of 44 subjects took colostrum, and the
other group of 39 did not take any type of
immunostimulant or antiviral drug. A third compa-
rable group of 38 subjects received only colostrum,
without a flu vaccination. The prophylaxis groups
were compared with a fourth group of 23 subjects
who did not use any prophylaxis.
Exclusion Criteria
Excluded were subjects with severe clinical dis-
ease, chronic diseases, an infection not controlled by
treatment, and those with diabetes. Patients who
had hospital admissions or surgery within 4 months
before inclusion, for any reason, were also excluded.
Treatment
Subjects in the colostrum groups used oral
tablets (one daily
, at 8:00 AM, for 8 weeks). The com-
position of the colostrum, in chewable tablets (ARD
Colostrum, Corcon srl, Milan, Italy) containing 400
mg of defatted bovine freeze-dried colostrum with
its characteristics, is reported in Table 1. The use of
other drugs, and particularly antiinfective drugs and
antibiotics, were avoided.
Vaccination had been performed within 2
weeks before inclusion into the follow-up period.
The type of vaccine administered was the standard
anti-flu vaccine supplied by the Italian National
Health Service.
Evaluation of the outcome was made consider-
ing as targets:
a. the presence and frequency of flu episodes
within the 2 months of prophylaxis;
b. the presence and frequency of flu episodes
in the third month (without prophylaxis);
c. the total number of days of malaise and/or
lost working days;
d. the relative costs due to the loss of work-
ing days;
e. the need for treatments and hospital
admissions; and
f.
the number of event-free subjects.

CESARONE ET AL
After the admission visit, all subjects were reeval-
uated by phone or personal contact every 2 weeks
with a questionnaire.
Part 2 of the study included very high-risk sub-
jects, including end-stage coronary patients and
patients with pulmonary hypertension or severe
cardiovascular problems. The protocol was com-
parable to the one described in healthy individuals
(part 1). However, because of the higher risk, all
groups had prophylaxis (there was no control
group without prophylaxis).
Statistical Analysis
Results were evaluated according to the
analysis of variance (flu episodes and days of
malaise), and a comparison (Mann-Whitney) non-
parametric test was performed at the end of the
study. An intention-to-treat analysis (ITTA) was
performed considering the difference between the
numbers of negative events (flu episodes plus the
number of dropouts) in the different groups.
RESULTS
Part 1
All groups were comparable (Table 2) for age
and sex distribution. Dropouts were determined by
nonmedical causes, including failure to come to
the control evaluation, failure to follow prescrip-
tions or minor errors, and breaking of the prophy-
laxis protocol.
Episodes and Days of Flu or Malaise
In the colostrum group (Table 3), the average
number of flu episodes in 2 months was 0.335
(range, 0 to 3) and was significantly lower than the
average in the vaccination group and in controls.
In the colostrum group there was 25% of days of
disease considering the total in the nonprophylaxis
group (P < .05). The days of disease in the
colostrum group were 30% of those recorded in
the vaccination group (P < .05). The difference is
clinically relevant and significant, even considering

the total of 3 months of observation (P < .05)
including 1 month without colostrum.
The total number of days of disease was 3 times
larger in untreated controls and in subjects who had
been treated with vaccination. The group treated
with vaccination and colostrum had results strictly
comparable with the results observed in the group
receiving only colostrum.
The relative costs were significantly lower in the
2 colostrum groups (P < .05) than in the others
groups and were comparable in the 2 colostrum
groups.
The total number of episodes (days of malaise)
in the colostrum group was 13 versus 14 in the
colostrum + vaccination group: 41 in the group
without prophylaxis and 57 in the vaccination
group, which is significantly higher (P < .05) than
in the 2 colostrum groups. The higher number of
episodes may suggest that vaccination itself may
induce a number of days with malaise in some
individuals.
The difference in the incidence of events asso-
ciated with flu, plus the dropouts in each group,
between colostrum subjects and controls was 4.2
(178/41.4); the incidence of events in nontreated
controls was therefore 4.2 times higher (P < .05).
The difference in incidence in events between
colostrum subjects and vaccination subjects was
3.9 (163.8/41.4); therefore, the incidence in
events in vaccination subjects was 3.9 times higher
than the incidence in the colostrum subjects
(P < .05).
Intention-to-Treat Analysis
The total number of event subjects (patients
having at least 1 flu episode) is added to dropouts
(total). This number is divided by the included sub-
jects. The dropouts are therefore considered as
events. Events in the vaccination and control groups
were 1.44 times higher than in the colostrum group.
The difference is statistically significant (P < .05).

CESARONE ET AL
Part 2
The second part of the study (Table 4) included
very-high-risk subjects (end-stage coronary patients,
patients with pulmonary hypertension or severe car-
diovascular problems). Of a group of 65, 60 completed
the study: 21 were treated with colostrum, 20 with
vaccination in association with colostrum, and 19 with
vaccination only
. The prophylaxis groups were clini-
cally comparable for age and sex distribution.
Events
As summarized in Table 4, only 3 of 20 patients
completing the study in the colostrum group had flu
associated with an important bronchopulmonary
complication. In the vaccination + colostrum group,
3 of the 20 patients completing the study also had
cardiopulmonary problems. Finally, in the vaccina-
tion group, 6 of 19 patients completing the study
had severe flu with cardiopulmonary complications
that resulted in 1 death. Hospital admissions in
these groups are also summarized in Table 4. The
incidence of complications and hospital admission
(ITTA) was significantly higher (P < .05) in the
group using only vaccination.
Costs
Costs evaluated during the study, mainly
owing to the lost working days, were parallel to
the occurrence of events. In the colostrum group,
costs were very close to 30% of those observed in
the noncolostrum groups.
If we consider hospital admissions (not observed
in the colostrum group, in part 1 of the study), partic-
ularly bronchopulmonary complications that followed
the flu episodes in elderly patients, the difference in
costs becomes even higher considering that some of
these episodes lasted well beyond the 3 months of
observation. No hospital admission was recorded in
the colostrum group and this observation, which
should be verified by larger studies, is of particular
interest.
Tolerability
No significant problems with tolerability or side
effects were observed during the study. Compliance
was very good (>88%), as only 12% of the tablets
were not used or not correctly used. This finding is
very useful considering that it is a prophylaxis and
not a disease, which usually attains a higher level of
compliance.
DISCUSSION
Vaccinations have generally produced a strik-
ing improvement in public health, reducing mor-
tality and morbidity through an improvement in
specific immunity, by increasing awareness, and
very often, just by a generic stimulation of immu-
nity. However, variation in virulence, antigenic
characteristics, and in protein content of several
viruses, reflecting their adaptation to changing sit-
uations, make the results of flu vaccination quite
unpredictable.
Several objections to the routine use of vacci-
nation have been raised. Many subjects seem to
have a limited benefit from vaccination, which is
active in developing immunity, particularly in
young subjects because their immune response is
very effective. In elderly subjects, the immune
response seems to be very limited, and therefore,
vaccination in these subjects seems to have a minor
effect and benefit.15 There is also the problem of

the type of virus used for prevention, which may be
different from the one that actually causes disease
in specific areas, populations, and times.6,16,17 The
use of vaccination in subjects with severe immuno-
logic and inflammatory disorders18 can be also
questioned because most vaccines may not be safe,
including those individuals with rheumatoid arthri-
tis; concerns have also been raised about flu vacci-
nation in pregnancy.19
The efficacy of flu vaccination and its cost-
effectiveness is probably questionable because of
the possible presence of unknown and known side
effects.20,21 A relation between the incidence of
intussusception associated with the first dose of
vaccine in infants was recently shown.22 It is theo-
retically possible that long-term effects may result
from elements present in the vaccination material
that are presently unknown, such as unknown
viral fractions. Even though flu vaccination has the
lowest incidence of side effects compared with
other types of vaccination,20 complications may
occur at a variable distance in time from the vac-
cination; therefore, it is difficult to define and
evaluate them carefully.
The use of colostrum, on the contrary, is prac-
tically free of side effects. Furthermore, the dosage
used in this study is very low, corresponding to
400 mg of colostrum.
Chronic diarrhea in HIV infection,11,12 diar-
rhea caused by rotavirus infection in children,13
and upper respiratory infection in adults,14
have been treated successfully with a high con-
centration of purified immunoglobulins from
colostrum, which is necessary once an infection
has already taken place. For prophylaxis, how-
ever, a lower concentration of a multicomponent
large-spectrum product such as colostrum can be
sufficient.
A very low concentration of insulin-like growth
factor I,23 lactoferrin, and lactoperoxidase24 can be
sufficient to determine protection as a nonspecific
defense, and similarly, complement factors25 and
oligosaccharides 26,27 can increase the body’s capa-
bility to produce passive immunity. A low concen-
tration of colostrum has been found to increase
the oxidative burst of leukocytes,28 and also low
concentrations of transforming growth factor-β1,
such as that present in colostrum, were able to reduce
the gastric damage induced by indomethacin.29,30
Colostrums containing different quantities of
immunoglobulins were found similarly active in the
reduction of endotoxin burden in rats and the infil-
tration of bacteria in mesenteric lymph nodes.31
Cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, tumor
necrosis factor-α, and interferon-γ, which are pres-
ent in colostrum,32 may stimulate production of
neutralizing antibodies against hemagglutinin and
neuramidase of the virus surface. All these observa-
tions indicate that colostrum activity belongs to a
combination of protective factors that may allow an
antiviral prophylaxis.
In many instances, flu starts from the intes-
tinal tract, and protection in situ may be one of the
advantages given by colostrum. Local activity in the
gut may be the most important factor. However,
rotavirus antibody were shown to survive during
the passage through the gut, which may also
determine systemic immunity.33
Very-high-risk subjects, including end-stage
coronary patients, patients with pulmonary
hypertension, and those and severe cardiovascular
problems, usually have a very severe prognosis
in case of flu, which almost always is associated
with severe bronchopulmonary complications that
often lead to hospital admission. The prevention
in these patients is very important, but the effects
of vaccination in these individuals seem to be of
very low efficacy owing to the very reduced
immune response.7 We conclude from our obser-
vations that colostrum appears to offer a more
effective protection.
A larger study is now in progress. It could
indicate that in severely ill subjects with poten-
tially fatal risks from cardiovascular complications,
colostrum may offer an important increase in resist-
ance, whereas vaccination, considering both age and
the relative decrease in immunologic resistance and
activity of these subjects, may be really ineffective or
only marginally useful. The efficacy of colostrum in
these subjects may be even more important because
they may have more complex and severe cardiores-
piratory complications. A larger study could provide
new data on the efficacy of colostrum as a preven-
tive measure to limit the diffusion and effects of flu
in high-risk cardiovascular patients.
CONCLUSION
The present study suggests a safe and cost-
effective method⎯which still needs more evalua-
tion in specific groups, particularly high-risk
cardiovascular patients⎯that may be considered
at least an important clinical alternative to vacci-
nation. There is evidence that in some situations in
which vaccination is contraindicated, the use of
colostrum may be not only more effective but the
only practical solution.
