Abstract
The wide range of factors associated with the induction of autism is invariably linked with either
inflammation or oxidative stress, and sometimes both. The use of acetaminophen in babies and
young children may be much more strongly associated with autism than its use during pregnancy,
perhaps because of well-known deficiencies in the metabolic breakdown of pharmaceuticals during
early development. Thus, one explanation for the increased prevalence of autism is that increased
exposure to acetaminophen, exacerbated by inflammation and oxidative stress, is neurotoxic in
babies and small children. This view mandates extreme urgency in probing the long-term effects of
acetaminophen use in babies and the possibility that many cases of infantile autism may actually be
induced by acetaminophen exposure shortly after birth.

 Introduction
Autism is a complex disorder associated
with a wide range of disparate and seemingly
unrelated factors such as (a) maternal expos-
ure to various chemical substances, (b)
maternal exposure to child abuse, (c) mater-
nal evidence of diabetes or other auto-
immune diseases, (d) age of either parent
at conception, (e) exposure of the infant to
various chemical substances, (f) vitamin D
levels of the infant at birth, (g) gender of the
infant, and (h) a large number of genetic
factors. With this in mind, we believe it is
helpful to categorize the factors associated
with autism in an effort to identify patterns
which may be informative. As described
below, these risk factors for autism fall into
two primary categories: those associated
with inflammation and those associated
with oxidative stress.
A number of risk factors for autism can
be categorized as risk factors for inflamma-
tion or indicators of inflammation (Table 1).
Risk factors for inflammation associated
with autism include maternal (odds ratio
[OR] ¼ 1.6,
confidence
interval
[CI]
95% ¼ 1.1–2.2)
and
perhaps
paternal
(OR ¼ 1.4, CI 95% ¼ 1.0–2.0) autoimmune
diseases such as diabetes, myasthenia gravis,
idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, or
rheumatic
fever,1
maternal
obesity
(OR ¼ 1.67, CI 95% ¼ 1.1–2.56),2 and feb-
rile episodes during the first two trimesters
(OR ¼ 1.6, CI 95% ¼ 1.0–2.5).3 An increase
in inflammation among individuals living in
Western societies is evidenced by the alarm-
ing rise of allergy and autoimmune disease
in the United States and other Westernized
countries over the past century and can be
attributed to five major causes that result
directly from social and cultural changes: (a)
an ‘‘inflammatory diet’’ high in fat and
simple sugars and low in fiber and nutrients,
(b) lack of physical exercise, (c) chronic and
unrequited psychological stress, (d) vitamin
D deficiency, and (e) biome depletion.4–7
The recent rise in autism8,9 could be attrib-
utable, at least in part, to this rise in
inflammation.10,11
Aside
from
inflammation,
oxidative
stress is the second category in the landscape
of autism-associated factors. As pointed out
by Chauhan and Chauhan, a wide range of
studies
‘‘. . . suggest
increased
oxidative
stress in autism that may contribute to the
development of this disease.’’12 However, it
is unknown whether factors causing oxida-
tive stress have increased in Western socie-
ties
concomitantly
with
inflammation.
Perhaps the weight of factors causing oxi-
dative stress peaked during the height of the
industrial revolution and has since declined
from that peak,9 but this is unknown.
Indeed, it may be difficult or even impossible
to determine whether, in terms of oxidative
stress, modern factors such as pharmaceut-
icals, pollutants from the combustion of
fossil fuels, and other factors from industrial
processes outweigh more historical factors
such as smoke from cooking fires and nat-
urally occurring toxins from food obtained
by hunting and gathering. Nevertheless,
oxidative stress is now associated with
modern
diseases.
Oxidative
stress,
like
inflammation, is associated with cancer,13
coronary artery disease,14 and a number of
psychiatric disorders.15 It is widely thought
that inflammation and oxidative stress go
hand in hand; as stated by Ghezzi and
colleagues, ‘‘The mechanism by which oxi-
dative stress induces inflammation and vice
versa is unclear but is of great import-
ance.’’16 Therefore, either oxidative stress
has increased or other changes in modern
society (e.g. increased inflammation) have
made oxidative stress more dangerous than
it was in past generations.
Thus, the list of diverse factors associated
with the induction of autism can be viewed
as interrelated when examined in the context
of two major categories, inflammation and
oxidative stress (Figure 1). For the purpose
of this discussion, factors involved in the

 induction of autism will be described as ‘‘low
risk’’ (1%–20% increased risk of autism),
‘‘moderate risk’’ (21%–100% increased risk
of autism), or ‘‘high risk’’ (any risk of autism
above 100% or 2-fold).
Autism and inflammation
Several
risk
factors
found
for
autism
have very straightforward connections to
inflammation (Table 1). Episodes of fever
greater than 7 days in the first and second
trimester carry a moderate risk factor for
autism
(hazard
ratio
[HR] ¼ 1.6,
CI
95% ¼ 1.0–2.5).3 In addition, autoimmune
diseases in the mother such as lupus, mul-
tiple sclerosis, diabetes, and rheumatic fever
are associated with moderate-to-high risk
for autism induction,17 as is maternal infec-
tion during pregnancy.18 Further, atopic
dermatitis and respiratory diseases in chil-
dren under the age of 2 years are also
associated with a moderate risk for the
development of autism.19
Another moderate risk factor for autism
that has a well-known association with

 inflammation
is obesity
(OR ¼ 1.67; CI
95% ¼ 1.1–2.56).2
Over
one-third
of
women in the United States of childbearing
age are obese and this number is steadily
rising.20 Multiple studies link obesity to
chronic, low-grade inflammation and the
subsequent secretion of pro-inflammatory
cytokines and infiltration of immune cells.21
Although it may be tempting to blame the
rise in autism on the rise in obesity and
autoimmune
disease,
these
risk
factors
alone, which are generally associated with
low-to-moderate increases in autism preva-
lence, likely do not account for the 30-fold
or greater increased prevalence of autism
since the 1970s.9,22
The prevalence of autism in children with
cerebral palsy is approximately 7-fold greater
than in the general population.23 Substantial
evidence points toward the view that cerebral
palsy, the most common cause of severe
motor disability in childhood, is associated
with inflammation. For example, many stu-
dies have linked fetal exposure to infection to
the development of cerebral palsy,24–26 and
blood samples from neonates with cerebral
palsy contain higher concentrations of many
pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines
compared with controls.27 Further, cerebral
palsy
is
associated
with
chorioamnioni-
tis,26,28–30 which can stimulate fetal produc-
tion of inflammatory cytokines including IL-
6.31 Thus, cerebral palsy, a high risk factor for
the development of autism, is linked to
inflammation.
Some risk factors for autism have less
obvious associations with inflammation. For
example, increasing age of the mother or the
father at the time of birth is associated with a
low or moderate risk of autism, respectively
(OR ¼ 1.15, >40 years for the mother and
OR ¼ 1.66, >50 years for the father).32,33
While age itself might not normally be con-
sidered inflammatory, there have been direct
associations found between increased age of
the parents and inflammatory diseases in their
offspring. For instance, maternal age �30
years at the time of birth is associated with an
increased incidence of one or more food
allergies in the child compared with controls
(75% vs. 55%, p ¼ 0.005).34 Further, the risk
of having children diagnosed with multiple
sclerosis steadily increases with paternal age
at birth from 21 to 55 years (adjusted OR for
21–25-year-old fathers ¼ 1.08 and
51–55-
year-old fathers ¼ 2.00).35 Thus, although
parental age, a moderate risk factor for
autism, is not intuitively associated with
inflammation, the
association
is
evident
based on published studies.
Maternal exposure to severe emotional
stress during her childhood and/or adoles-
cence is another risk factor (OR ¼ 3.7, CI
95% ¼ 2.3–5.8) for autism36 that may not be
intuitively associated with inflammation.
However, the link between childhood and
adolescent adversity and immune dysregula-
tion and inflammation is widely appreciated
by the scientific community. Multiple stu-
dies demonstrate that a wide range of
stressful events taking place in one’s child-
hood can adversely affect health and inflam-
matory responses even into the eighth
decade of life.37–40 Exposure of women to
two or more early childhood stressful events,
including physical, emotional, or sexual
abuse,
is
positively
correlated
with
an
increased risk of Th1, Th2, and rheumatic
autoimmune development later in life com-
pared with women reporting no events in
childhood (p < 0.05).41 Markers of inflam-
mation (IL-6 and C-reactive protein) have
been found to be elevated in a systemic
manner in women who experienced sexual
abuse in adolescence compared with women
without a history of abuse (p ¼ 0.04 for IL-6
and 0.03 for C-reactive protein).42 Further, a
recent study of 28,456 African American
women found a positive association between
adult-onset asthma and physical or sexual
abuse experienced during childhood or ado-
lescence after adjusting for multiple con-
founders such as parental history of asthma,
body mass index, exercise, current smoking
Parker et al.
411
 habits,
and
exposure
to
secondhand
smoke.43 Childhood stress also affects a
woman’s response to current, daily stressors.
For example, elevated levels (2.35-fold) of
IL-6 have been found within 24 hours in
response to current daily stressful events in
sera from women who experienced child-
hood abuse compared with women who
experienced the same number of daily stres-
sors without a history of child abuse.44
Other examples of the impact of early life
stress
on
inflammation
abound.37,45–48
Thus, maternal exposure to stress during
early life, a high risk factor for autism, is
clearly associated with inflammation.
Autism and oxidative stress:
Environmental toxins
Exposure to environmental toxins, a source
of oxidative stress, has been associated with
autism in a number of studies.49 Maternal
exposure during gestation to agricultural
pesticides
such
as
organophosphates,
organochlorines, and pyrethroids has been
identified as a moderate-to-high risk factor
for autism.50–52 The risk seems to be depend-
ent at least in part on the proximity to the
applied chemical and the trimester during
which the exposure took place. However,
the data are somewhat noisy and, as pointed
out by the authors, possibly confounded by
unavoidable misclassifications in the estima-
tions of maternal exposure. In contrast to
evidence of the effects of exposure in utero,
evidence for exposure to pesticides after
birth as a risk factor for autism is slim to
non-existent. Maternal exposure to traffic-
related air pollutants also carries risk factors
for autism. For example, exposure to par-
ticulate matter during the third trimester is a
low-to-moderate risk factor for autism,53–55
while maternal exposure to other traffic-
related toxins (e.g. mercury, lead, arsenic,
cadmium, manganese, styrene, trichloro-
ethylene, and vinyl chloride) is a moderate-
to-high risk factor for autism.56–58 However,
these findings were not replicated in a study
of four European countries.59 Furthermore,
the range of variability in U.S. air pollution
(e.g. interquartile ranges of only 4–5 mcg/m3
in fine particulate matter [PM2.5]) over
which associations with autism spectrum
disorder have been reported53–55 is quite
small compared with the more severe air
pollution
encountered
routinely
in
the
developing world (for example, >900 mcg/
m3 when indoor cooking stoves are used).60
Additionally, exposure to many environmen-
tal toxins such as vehicular and air pollution,
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), lead, poly-
cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and
organochlorines and organophosphates has
decreased over at least part, if not most, of the
time frame in which autism prevalence has
continued to climb.9 Further, factors such as
exposures to phthalates, atmospheric mer-
cury levels, and total blood mercury have
remained relatively stable since the 1990s,
although exposure to polybrominated diphe-
nyl ethers (PBDEs) and glyphosates has
increased.9 However, to date, few studies
have
associated
exposure
to
phthalates,
PCBs, PBDEs, PAHs, or glyphosates to the
development of autism. With this in mind, it
seems likely that the relative contribution of
any single environmental oxidative stressor to
the prevalence of autism is most likely
dependent on the location or population in
question.
Autism and oxidative stress:
Jaundice
Hyperbilirubinemia (the symptoms of which
are known as jaundice) is associated with
elevated oxidative stress61 and impedes the
clearance of acetaminophen,62 a drug sus-
pected of inducing autism (see discussion
below). Jaundice is associated with autism,63
although the connection between jaundice
and autism had some early critics.64 The idea
was that early studies pointing toward a
connection between jaundice and autism
412
Journal of International Medical Research 45(2)
 may have been confounded by some condi-
tion or conditions associated with autism but
unrelated to jaundice. These conditions may
have been responsible for keeping the chil-
dren in the hospital for longer periods of time,
which could have resulted in an increased
chance of receiving a diagnosis of jaundice.
However, a prospective study design using a
large sample size in Taiwan seems to have
addressed major concerns with the previous
studies, and the connection between jaundice
and autism is apparently real.65
Autism and oxidative stress:
Sex, Down syndrome, and
preterm birth
Perhaps the most widely known risk factor
for autism is being male. The increased risk of
autism for males was established very early
during work with patients having autism, and
is approximately 4-fold that of females.
Although being male is not widely known to
be associated with oxidative stress, male
infants are more susceptible to oxidative
stress than female infants,66–68 and have
been found to have more oxidative stress.69
Further, male children seem to be more
susceptible to toxin-induced oxidative stress
than females.70 The occurrence of Down
syndrome is also a risk factor for autism,
with more than 5% of individuals with Down
syndrome having autism.71 Down syndrome
is also associated with a profound increase in
oxidative stress and inflammation,72,73 point-
ing again toward a connection between oxi-
dative stress and the induction of autism.
Preterm birth, a complex and often idio-
pathic complication of pregnancy, is a high
risk factor for the development of autism.
Limperopoulos and colleagues found that
26% of preterm, low birth weight infants
had a positive result on the Modified
Checklist
for
Autism
in
Toddlers
(M-
CHAT) autism screening tool74 compared
with
5.7%
of
non-preterm
infants
(OR¼4.56).75 This risk is corroborated by
several additional studies with odds ratios of
6.3 (CI 95% ¼ 2.2–18.3) for children born
preterm
in
the
United
Kingdom
and
Ireland75 and 3.2 (CI 95% ¼ 2.6–4.0) for
children who were born preterm in Sweden
using
a
sibling-comparison
approach.76
Preterm birth has long been associated with
inflammation, with approximately 50% of
preterm births being associated with chor-
ioamnionitis.77,78
In
addition,
oxidative
stress has recently been hypothesized as a
co-mechanism for the initiation of preterm
birth.77,79,80 Further, oxidative stress is asso-
ciated with preterm birth.81–83 Thus, preterm
birth, a risk factor for autism, is associated
with both inflammation and oxidative stress.
Autism and oxidative stress:
Vitamin B
Excessively high levels of maternal vitamin
B12 and vitamin B9 (folate) are additional
risk factors linked to autism.84 In a study of
the association between vitamin B levels and
risk of autism, excessively high prenatal
vitamin B12 levels in mothers (HR ¼ 3.01,
CI 95% ¼ 1.64–5.52; P value: 0.001) and
excessively
high
prenatal
folate
levels
(HR¼2.27, CI 95% ¼ 1.26–4.09; P value:
0.007) were each found to be associated with
a
significantly
increased
risk
of
infant
autism. Together, excessively high vitamin
B12 and folate levels in maternal blood sera
show the highest increased risk of infantile
autism (HR: 17.59; P value: <0.001).84
Vitamin B9 and B12 are antioxidants, and
thus, intuitively, high levels of these vitamins
should be associated with a decreased risk
for oxidative stress. However, excessively
high levels of vitamin B12 in the blood are
common and are often paradoxically indi-
cative of a clinical deficiency of vitamin
B12.85 In one case, for example, excessively
high levels of vitamin B12 were caused by the
presence of anti-vitamin B12 antibodies that
led to the formation of functionally inactive
IgG-IgM-B12
immune
complexes.86
In
Parker et al.
413
 general, excessively high levels of vitamin
B12 and the associated functional deficiency
of that antioxidant could lead to difficulties
in the ability to cope with oxidative stress,
and indeed have been consistently linked to
inflammatory diseases such as neoplasms,
hematological malignancies, and liver and
kidney diseases.85
Not only are exceedingly high levels of
folate associated with autism,84 the presence
of anti-folate receptor autoantibodies has
been shown to be highly prevalent (75.3%)
in children with autism.87 Such autoantibodies
would create a functional deficiency of folate
in the brain regardless of the concentration of
folate in the serum. Folate deficiency is highly
deleterious and is associated with reduced
activity of antioxidant enzymes, as well as
overall increased oxidative stress.88,89
Hypothetically, excessive levels of folate
in the serum could be an indication of a
clinical insufficiency of folate, just as exces-
sively high levels of vitamin B12 are linked
to a clinical insufficiency of that vitamin.
Regardless of the reasons for excessively
high levels of folate, they have been asso-
ciated with inflammatory bowel disease,90
indicating that the high levels are related in
some way to inflammation.
Autism and oxidative stress:
Genetic variation
Polymorphic variants related to the metab-
olism of methionine transmethylation and
transsulfuration, which increase susceptibil-
ity to endogenous and environmental oxi-
dative stress, are significantly different in
children with autism.91–93 Studies show a
decreased ability in children with these gen-
etic variants to handle oxidative stress as
measured by several metabolic biomarkers
including S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), S-
adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), adenosine,
homocysteine, cystathionine, cysteine, oxi-
dized and reduced glutathione, endogenous
secretory receptor for advanced glycation
end-products (RAGE), and the pro-inflam-
matory ligand S100A9. In addition, poly-
morphisms in glutathione pathways, which
modulate the response to oxidative stress,
strongly affect risk for autism. For example,
the homozygous GSTM1 deletion genotype
imposes a near 2-fold increased risk for
autism.94,95 Further, polymorphisms of the
glutathione S-transferase P1 gene (GSTP1)
in the mother, which could affect the fetus
during pregnancy, are high risk factors for
the induction of autism (OR ¼ 2.67, CI
95% ¼ 1.39–5.13).96 Thus, several genetic
variants that affect pathways involved in
oxidative stress are risk factors for autism.
Synergism between oxidative
stress and inflammation:
Evidence from animal models
Inflammation can be caused by a diverse set
of factors associated with Western culture,
including chronic psychological stress and
biome depletion (Figure 1), which at first
glance might seem unrelated to inflamma-
tion. However, it is now recognized that
these non-chemical inflammatory mediators
(e.g. limited resources or social support for
the mother, leading to chronic psychological
stress) can increase vulnerability of the fetus
to chemical stressor exposures (e.g. oxida-
tive stressors such as pollution or toxins).97
This view potentially explains why a single
exposure or risk factor in isolation is a
modest predictor of autism risk. Given the
complex nature of environmental and social
exposures,
attempts
at
deciphering
the
mechanisms
that
contribute
to
autism
suffer from fatal oversimplification if those
models involve only single agents. In con-
trast, useful and relevant models must
include multiple factors. For example, an
experimental animal model has been devel-
oped that employs the combined effects of
an ethologically relevant maternal stressor
and an environmentally relevant pollutant,
diesel exhaust, both of which have been
414
Journal of International Medical Research 45(2)
 implicated in autism.55,57,98–102 Using this
model, it was demonstrated that maternal
exposure to diesel exhaust particles com-
bined with maternal stress, but neither in
isolation, produced long-term cognitive def-
icits and strikingly increased anxiety in male
but not female offspring.97
Evidence for a mediator other
than inflammation and
oxidative stress
The likely role of oxidative stressors and
inflammation in the pathogenesis of autism
is apparent based on the nature of risk
factors associated with autism. This conclu-
sion is corroborated by numerous studies,
described
above
and
reviewed
else-
where,10,103–109 that have identified immune
activation and inflammation in patients with
autism. Further, treatment with antioxi-
dants or anti-inflammatory agents such as
sulforaphane110 and helminth therapy,111
respectively, can help some patients with
autism. However, it seems unlikely that
oxidative stress and inflammation alone
account for the dramatic rise in the inci-
dence of autism since 1980. Inflammation in
general has increased steadily since the turn
of the twentieth century, as indicated by a
slow and steady rise in a wide range of
allergic disorders, autoimmune conditions,
and
other
inflammation-associated
dis-
eases.112 The very rapid rise in autism since
the early 1980s might suggest that one or
more specific environmental factors are at
play.
As
we
and
others
have
pointed
out,9,10,113 it is possible that the rapid
‘‘increase’’ in autism is due simply to
increased awareness and changing diagnos-
tic criteria, but substantial evidence which
contradicts this conclusion is available and a
working hypothesis that autism has pro-
foundly increased over the last 40 years
holds the most promise for a rapid reso-
lution of the problem.10 That is to say, if
autism is indeed an ancient and natural
consequence of ‘‘being human,’’ then autism
may be much more difficult to prevent than
if it is induced by factors present in modern
society.10
We have suggested10 that arguments for
and against autism as an epidemic (or
pandemic) can only be resolved (a) if a
specific trigger for autism is found, facilitat-
ing the elimination of autism; or (b) if
complete
normalization
of
the
immune
system (leading to a pre-industrial condition
of essentially no allergies) succeeds in elim-
inating autism. Given that complete nor-
malization of the immune system may take
years or even generations to accomplish, and
given the recent apparent rise in autism
described above, the search for very specific
and potent triggers for the induction of
autism seems worthwhile.
Proposed triggers of the autism
epidemic: Aspartame
Aspartame is an artificial sweetener that has
been in use since 1981, about the time that
the autism epidemic started (Figure 2).
Aspartame breaks down in the body and
releases methanol, an oxidative stressor and
toxin. Its use has been attributed to the rise in
autism.114 However, the use of other sweet-
eners has replaced aspartame in the past 10
years, except in diet soft drinks, and the
consumption of diet soft drinks has been in
decline. Thus, there is no association over
time between autism and aspartame. Further,
the presence of methanol in canned vege-
tables and in cigarette smoke is not new, and
thus the relatively low incidence of autism
prior to the mid-1900s cannot be accounted
for if methanol, by itself, is a major trigger.
Further, Pepsi Cola� has at least temporarily
removed aspartame from its drinks, which
eliminates at least for a time one of the major
remaining sources of aspartame consumption
in the United States. If indeed aspartame is
the major trigger for autism, then the ‘‘experi-
ment’’ has been accomplished already and
Parker et al.
415
 the rate of autism should be in the process of
decreasing. This does not appear to be the
case, apparently disproving the hypothesis.
Proposed triggers of the autism
epidemic: Ethyl mercury and
vaccines
The view that vaccines and ethyl mercury in
particular, a component of the preservative
thimerosal
used in some vaccines,
can
induce the development of autism is wide-
spread among non-scientists115,116 and has
been discussed widely in the literature.117,118
Proposed mechanisms of induction depend
on the difference between methyl and ethyl
mercury119 to account for the relatively
recent rise of autism compared with the
centuries-old
use
of
methyl
mercury.
However, a study addressing this issue
found no association between levels of
mercury exposure during vaccination and

 the incidence of autism 120. Further, a
substantial reduction in exposure to ethyl
mercury as a result of elimination of thimer-
osal from vaccines has not reduced the rate
of autism. It has been counter-argued that
‘‘no level is safe,’’ suggesting that any
amount of ethyl mercury may be dangerous.
However, since the induction of autism (by
whatever agent) is apparently not near the
saturation point (presumably yielding a rate
of 100% autism in the population, at which
point the rate of autism would be independ-
ent of increasing or decreasing levels of
inducing agent), then it is expected that a
substantial reduction in the amount of
inducing agent would lead to at least some
reduction in the level of autism. It has been
argued that perhaps aluminum adjuvants
now replace mercury preservative as the
vaccine-associated agent, but then ethyl
mercury and aluminum must be different
from methyl mercury in some regard, strain-
ing the original hypothesis regarding the
uniqueness of ethyl mercury. It could be
counter-argued that the route of exposure
(injection vs. dietary intake) of the metal is
important, but in the one widely accepted
instance in which a vaccine caused the
induction of a neuropsychiatric disorder
(narcolepsy with cataplexy), no metal pre-
servatives
or
metal
adjuvants
were
involved.120 Thus it could be argued that it
is the vaccination in general that is critically
important, not the metal per se. Yet vaccines
are much older in their origins than autism,
and it is not intuitive that a vaccine would be
worse than an actual life-threatening infec-
tion, the origins of which are ancient and
pre-date the human race. This view is
corroborated by a cohort of parents who
did not vaccinate younger siblings of chil-
dren with autism; failure to vaccinate with
one or even all vaccines did not prevent
autism.122,123 Most importantly, acetamino-
phen, the analgesic most commonly admin-
istered in conjunction with vaccination and
the only analgesic administered to children
under the age of 6 months following vaccin-
ation, has been identified as a likely inducer
of autism.124 Initial studies described below
suggest that it is the co-administration of
this analgesic with vaccines that may have
given many parents the false impression that
their child’s autism was induced by a
vaccine.
Proposed mediators of the autism
epidemic: Acetaminophen
Acetaminophen has been widely used in
adults for more than half a century as a
pain reliever and anti-pyretic, and is by far
the most commonly used medication for
pain and fever during pregnancy125 and in
the pediatric population.126,127 By the early
1980s,
acetaminophen
had
effectively
replaced the analgesic phenacetin, which is
metabolized
to
acetaminophen
by
the
body128,129 and which had been widely
used since the late 1800s despite its carcino-
genic and toxic nature. The therapeutic
action of acetaminophen involves inhibition
of prostaglandin synthesis, a surprisingly
important biochemical process involved in
development and neurological function, as
shown in Figure 3. Acetaminophen elimin-
ation from the body typically involves bio-
chemical modification in the liver by phase
II metabolism, which entails the addition of
sulfate
(or
glucuronide
more
often
in
adults130) to the molecule, facilitating its
elimination (Figure 3). However, the drug
can also be modified via phase I metabolism,
producing NAPQI, a highly toxic metabolite
which is then processed via phase II metab-
olism to a non-toxic product by the addition
of cysteine in a manner dependent on gluta-
thione (Figure 3). Acetaminophen is known
to be safer in children than in adults,
presumably because the drug cannot be
rapidly converted by the child’s relatively
undeveloped liver into toxic metabolites.131
However, this view of acetaminophen’s
safety is based strictly on the low rate of
Parker et al.
417
 acute adverse events such as liver and kidney
failure
and
intestinal
bleeding.131,132
Unfortunately, the long-term effects of acet-
aminophen exposure on neural development
have never been evaluated in humans.
However, Margaret McCarthy’s lab has
shown that drug-mediated inhibition of
prostaglandin synthesis (as is accomplished
by acetaminophen) in laboratory rats during
‘‘a time sensitive window in early postnatal
life’’ not only results in significant long-term
modifications to brain development and
morphology but also leads to decreased
social interactions and reduced sensory
function in male but not female animals.133
Further, in vitro studies using human cell
lines have shown that acetaminophen can
cause
‘‘an
immediate,
reversible,
dose-
dependent loss of oxygen uptake followed
by a slow, irreversible, dose-independent
death’’ and have suggested mechanisms by
which acetaminophen may cause toxicity in
tissues other than the liver.134
Given
its
suppression
of
the
febrile
response, one might expect that the general
effects
of
exposure
to
acetaminophen
would
be
anti-inflammatory
in
nature.
Unfortunately, this expectation is false.
Studies in adult humans demonstrate that
even
low-dose
acetaminophen
triggers
immune system activation and oxidative
stress responses.135 Further, medical profes-
sionals evaluating immune responses from a
biologists’ perspective have warned that the

glucorinadation, like sulfation, leads to detoxification of acetaminophen, but sulfation is the primary
mechanism active in infants and children.
418

 febrile response is both adaptive (beneficial
to survival) and ancient in its origins,136 with
behaviors which induce fever-like tempera-
tures evident in cold-blooded animals.137
Thus, biologists argue that inhibition of
the febrile response is likely not without
costs.137 It has even been postulated that the
elimination of fevers may be responsible in
part
for
the
induction
of
autism.138
However, the health costs of eliminating
low-grade fevers in general are not known.
On the other hand, some data regarding the
health costs of using acetaminophen are
described in the literature. A multinational
study with more than 200,000 children
found a dose-dependent association between
use of acetaminophen in the first year of life
and the occurrence of inflammatory diseases
such as asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis, and
eczema later in life.139 The causal relation-
ship between use of acetaminophen and the
occurrence
of
asthma
has
been
ques-
tioned,140 but the consensus is that a rela-
tionship exists141,142 and a population-wide
increase in asthma of more than 40% may
be caused by the use of acetaminophen.143
Perhaps even more concerning than stu-
dies demonstrating acetaminophen-induced
social impairment in animal models, acet-
aminophen-induced injury to cultured cells,
and acetaminophen-induced inflammation
in adults, are studies pointing toward a
connection
between
acetaminophen
and
neurological problems in children. A sum-
mary of such studies is shown in Table 2. A
sibling-controlled study with over 48,000
children in Norway showed that the use of
acetaminophen
but
not
ibuprofen
by
mothers during pregnancy was associated
with problems in the psychomotor, behav-
ioral, and temperamental development of
children at 3 years of age.144 Further, a study
in Bristol, United Kingdom, of more than
7000 children showed that maternal use of
acetaminophen during pregnancy was asso-
ciated with hyperactivity and ‘‘emotional
symptoms’’ at age 7.145 In addition, a study
at UCLA in collaboration with scientists in
Denmark and Taiwan found that children
whose mothers used acetaminophen during
pregnancy were at higher risk of being
diagnosed
with
hyperkinetic
disorder
(HR ¼ 1.37,
CI
95% ¼ 1.19–1.59).
To
quote the authors, ‘‘Results did not appear
to be confounded by maternal inflamma-
tion,
infection
during
pregnancy,
the
mother’s mental health problems, or other
[variables they examined].’’146 A more recent
Danish study came to the same conclu-
sions.147
Further,
a
study
from
New
Zealand found associations between acet-
aminophen use during pregnancy and atten-
tion-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
at 7 and 11 years of age,148 with the authors
concluding that their work supports ‘‘earlier
claims that findings [of increased ADHD
with acetaminophen use] are specific to
acetaminophen.’’ The authors further state
that ‘‘The finding that even low doses of
acetaminophen (indicated by the number of
weeks of drug exposure) can affect behavior
7 years later is alarming because acetamino-
phen (paracetamol) is the most commonly
used antenatal drug.’’ Indeed, new studies
supporting the view that prenatal acet-
aminophen use is associated with long-
term negative effects on brain function are
currently being published on a monthly
basis.145,149
Acetaminophen rapidly enters the cere-
brospinal fluid to exert its effects.150 In
addition to reducing fever and physical
pain, acetaminophen has a profound effect
on
adult
brain
function,
blunting
the
response to both negative and positive
stimuli, including threatening stimuli,151,152
and reducing behavioral responses to social
rejection.153 Further, the drug impairs the
ability of adults to identify errors made
during the performance of simple tasks.154
In animal models, the use of acetaminophen
during development has been shown to
cause permanent alterations in cognitive
function.155

 neurological function in adults, the widely
appreciated
connections
between
acet-
aminophen use during pregnancy and neu-
rodevelopmental problems, and studies in
animal models pointing toward potential
problems with acetaminophen for brain
development,133,155 acetaminophen is now
the most widely used medicine in the pedi-
atric
population,
readily
available
for
infants in an over-the-counter form labeled
as ‘‘safe, gentle, and effective,’’ with no
warnings of side effects other than allergic
reactions.
A connection between acetaminophen
and autism was first identified in 2008 by
Schultz et al.,156 who found that acetamino-
phen
use
by
children
was
significantly
associated with autism in children aged 5
years or less (OR¼6.11, CI 95% ¼ 1.42–
26.3). Subsequently, several investigators
noted that the marked increase in autism,
asthma, and ADHD in the early 1980s
corresponded
with
the
replacement
of
aspirin with acetaminophen.157,158 In add-
ition, Schultz noted that the long-term,
steady increase in the prevalence of autism
was punctuated by short-term decreases
coinciding with widely publicized cases of
acetaminophen poisoning that temporarily
deterred the public from using the drug.159
Further, evidence has surfaced indicating
that neural pathways affected by acetamino-
phen may be ‘‘different’’ in some regards in
people with autism.159,160 This observation
is potentially a ‘‘smoking gun,’’ suggestive of
the role of acetaminophen in the pathogen-
esis of autism. Interestingly, Bauer and
colleagues noted that acetaminophen use
with circumcision may be associated with an
increased prevalence of autism in some
locations.157 A second and more recent
study looking at the connection between
circumcision and autism, this one by Frisch
and Simonsen, found a 2-fold increased risk
of autism identified before age 5 in circum-
cised boys compared with uncircumcised
boys.161 But of course, the degree to which
acetaminophen use during circumcision is
associated with autism will depend not only
on the ability of acetaminophen to induce
autism but also on other factors such as the
relative amount of acetaminophen used fol-
lowing circumcision compared with other
uses in the pediatric population.
A Danish National Birth Cohort study
recently found that prenatal use of acet-
aminophen is associated with an increased
risk of autism accompanied by hyperkinetic
symptoms
(HR ¼ 1.51;
CI
95% ¼ 1.19–
1.92).124 More recently, a Spanish study
supported the connection between acet-
aminophen exposure during pregnancy and
autism in the offspring.162 Although the
increase from prenatal exposure is statistic-
ally significant and indeed concerning, the
risk was more than 10-fold less than that
originally identified by Schultz when evalu-
ating the use of acetaminophen in children.
As discussed below, post-partum (infancy
and early childhood) exposure to acet-
aminophen may result in a much higher
risk of developing autism than prenatal
exposure.
Schultz, whose 2008 study was the first to
identify acetaminophen use in small children
as a potential cause of autism, very recently
found that older children with autism actu-
ally use less (not more) acetaminophen than
neurotypical controls.163 Thus, small chil-
dren who eventually develop autism have
more often been exposed to acetaminophen
than controls, but older children with autism
are less likely to use the drug. Schultz
suggested that this observation may be
hypothetically explained if parents noticed
that their child with autism did not respond
to acetaminophen. Studies in animal models
have shown that early life exposure to
acetaminophen causes a lack of response to
the same drug later in life,155 and Schultz
postulated that the same may occur in
humans.163 Another explanation, not mutu-
ally exclusive, is that parents may have
learned that acetaminophen is associated
Parker et al.
421
 with autism, and thus discontinued admin-
istration of the drug to their child. The
connection
between
acetaminophen
and
autism is common knowledge among par-
ents who have children with autism, as it has
been promoted by grass-roots organizations
such as Reset.Me and SafeMinds.
Plausible mechanisms for the induction of
autism by acetaminophen have been formu-
lated,113,158,159 adding further support to the
potential role of acetaminophen in the patho-
genesis of autism. McCarthy, for example,
has provided a plausible explanation for the
idea that inhibition of prostaglandin synthe-
sis (by acetaminophen, for example) would
have a much different effect on the male brain
than on the female brain.164 However, the
existence of a plausible mechanism alone may
be considered inadequate by itself to support
studies regarding the acetaminophen–autism
connection, since detailed mechanisms have
been proposed for the induction of autism by
several factors, including ethyl mercury from
vaccine preservatives165 and methanol from
diet soft drinks.114 The removal of ethyl
mercury from vaccines and the reduction of
aspartame consumption have removed these
environmental factors from prime suspicion
for inducers of autism (see discussion above),
despite
the
publication
of
hypothetical
mechanistic
underpinnings.
Thus,
the
availability of a hypothetical mechanism for
the induction of autism by a particular agent
is not a good indicator for its actual role in
the pathogenesis of disease. However, given
the weight of the burden of autism on society,
it seems reasonable to test all plausible
environmental triggers for the induction of
autism.
Albeit indirectly, yet another factor points
toward a role of acetaminophen in the devel-
opment of autism: the lack of any published
association between cystic fibrosis (CF) and
autism stands out as the exception to the rule
of association between inflammatory condi-
tionsandautism.CFisclearlyassociatedwith
mucosal inflammation166 but no connection
between autism and CF has been published,
suggestingthatifanyassociationdoesexist,it
is not as conspicuous as that seen with other
inflammation-associated
conditions
(e.g.
cerebral palsy, preterm birth, or Down syn-
drome). Indeed, physicians at two independ-
ent clinics, each having treated hundreds of
CF patients, recalled no patients with autism
whatsoever in discussions with one of the
authors (WP). An explanation for this poten-
tial exception to the rule of association
between inflammation and autism lies in the
fact that adults and children with CF tend to
metabolize acetaminophen through phase II
pathways much more so than do healthy
controls.167,168 This feature of metabolism in
CF patients may be a ‘‘consequence of
disease-specificchangesinbothenzymeactiv-
ity and/or drug transport within the liver.’’168
In this regard, CF patients are very different
from patients with autism, who tend to have
impaired phase II metabolism (Figure 3).
Although speculative at present, the idea
that CF may be protective from autism
merits further study and may provide insight
into the pathogenesis of the latter.
Why evaluate the connection
between post-partum
acetaminophen exposure
and autism?
The possible role of acetaminophen exposure
in neonates and young children in the patho-
genesis of autism demands further study for a
number of reasons. First, as pointed out
above, the odds ratio for autism associated
with acetaminophen exposure in children is
one of the highest ever reported, exceeding
the odds ratios consistently reported for
exposure in utero. The initial study based
on surveys156 was conducted almost 10 years
ago and has yet to be confirmed or refuted by
more rigorous studies.
Perhaps even more compelling than the
reason above, a second line of evidence
422
Journal of International Medical Research 45(2)
 points toward the need to evaluate the
connection between post-partum use of
acetaminophen and autism. This evidence
is based in part on two important epidemio-
logical
observations
made
by
Bernard
Rimland, founder of the Autism Research
Institute in 1967 and the individual respon-
sible
for
undermining
the
horrendous
‘‘refrigerator mother’’ hypothesis that pre-
vailed during the first 20 years of research on
autism. As shown in Figure 2, Rimland
noted a rapid rise in the rate of autism
beginning in the early 1980s.169 Although he
did not connect this rise with the use of
acetaminophen in neonates and children, the
widespread use of acetaminophen in infants,
neonates, toddlers, and small children began
in the early 1980s as a result of the discovery
that aspirin may be associated with Reye
syndrome.170 This apparent rise in the
prevalence of autism starting in the early
1980s has been corroborated by data col-
lected in the state of California (Figure 2,
lower diagram). In addition to an increase in
prevalence, Rimland also noted a simultan-
eous increase in the relative ratio of regres-
sive to infantile autism (Figure 2), as might
be expected if a new and extremely potent
trigger for the disease was introduced into
the population which affected newborns and
small children but not necessarily fetuses.
Rimland’s study was not the last to
suggest the emergence of a preponderance
of regressive autism. In 2010, Ozonoff and
colleagues published a prospective evalu-
ation of behavior in children who would
eventually be diagnosed with autism.171
Ozonoff collected data starting at 6 months
of age and focused on at-risk children,
mostly those with siblings that had autism.
Surprisingly, more than 85% of the children
eventually
diagnosed
with
autism
were
indistinguishable
from
neurotypically
developing children at 6 months of age,
but showed declines in social communica-
tion between 6 and 18 months. Thus, shortly
prior to 2010, when Ozonoff’s data were
collected, most children with autism appar-
ently presented with a regressive phenotype.
Intuitively,
a
preponderance
of
the
regressive phenotype weakens any assump-
tion that prenatal exposure is centrally or
exclusively important. Indeed, there is no
‘‘proof’’ that autism is based on architec-
tural
changes
laid
down
before
birth.
Associations between imaging and neuro-
pathic findings and phenotype have been
found,172,173 but no one has systematically
assessed the extent to which documented
brain architectural differences in individuals
diagnosed with autism (a diagnosis that
cannot presently be made prenatally or in
the first year and a half of life) derive from
altered prenatal neurodevelopmental pro-
cesses as compared with tissue changes
acquired over time from disturbances in
key phenomena such as excitation/inhib-
ition balance, bioenergetics, immune func-
tion, or other metabolic processes. Indeed, it
is widely appreciated that pathophysio-
logical changes can be set off not just by
early genetic or environmental influences
but also in many ways at many times of life.
Another compelling reason to probe the
post-partum
acetaminophen–autism
con-
nection is that, if indeed acetaminophen
exposure during early childhood is found
to be an important player in the pathogen-
esis of autism, then reduction of the inci-
dence of autism is readily achievable, with
the primary concern being establishing best
practices for the treatment of fevers and pain
in children under 6 months of age. Given
that acetaminophen exposure in pregnant
women is associated with an increase in the
risk of autism,124 it would be quite surpris-
ing and perhaps very informative from a
mechanistic perspective if indeed a dramatic
reduction
in
acetaminophen
exposure
during early childhood did not cause a
dramatic reduction in the incidence of
autism.
Yet another reason to investigate the role
of
early
childhood
exposure
to
Parker et al.
423
 acetaminophen
in
the
pathogenesis
of
autism is that eliminating acetaminophen
exposure early in life is unlikely to cause net
harm, regardless of the effect on autism.
Acetaminophen has never been shown to
save lives in any controlled study and, as
described above, is known to be associated
with the induction of asthma and the pres-
ence of a variety of developmental delays.
Going even further, Ohlsson and Shah state
in their recent Cochrane report of acet-
aminophen use during a major thoracic
surgery frequently performed on infants
(surgical
closure
of
the
patent
ductus
arteriosus):
In view of a recent report in mice of adverse
effects on the developing brain from para-
cetamol
[acetaminophen],
and
another
report of an association between prenatal
paracetamol and the development of autism
or autism spectrum disorder in childhood,
long-term follow-up to at least 18 to 24
months postnatal age must be incorporated
in any studies of paracetamol in the newborn
population. Such trials are required before
any recommendations for the use of para-
cetamol in the newborn population can be
made.174
In
other
words,
Ohlsson
and
Shah
argue that acetaminophen should not be
recommended, even for major and neces-
sary surgical procedures, until it is known
whether
or
not
it
does
in
fact
cause
autism.
Another reason to conduct a study of the
early childhood acetaminophen–autism con-
nection is the observations of parents.
During the 70-year history of investigating
the pathogenesis of autism, scientists and
pediatricians have made two well-documen-
ted and costly errors, both associated with
dismissing the observations of parents. The
first error was the acceptance for 20 years of
the
‘‘refrigerator
mother’’
hypothesis.175
The second error was a firm belief, held
until
2005,
that
autism
could
not
be
regressive and associated with a decline in
previously existing neuropsychiatric func-
tion. At present, half of all parents of
children with autism suspect vaccines as an
underlying cause of their child’s condi-
tion.176 One study found that 29% of all
mothers, with or without a child with
autism, believe that autism can be induced
by vaccines.177 Other studies,178 as well as
surveys by various polling organizations
such as Harris, Thompson Reuters, and
the National League of Consumers, have
reached similar conclusions. For reasons
discussed above, it seems apparent that
vaccines are not the underlying cause of
the epidemic of autism, but at the same time,
if history is any indication, ignoring the
perspectives of parents is a grave error. The
idea that vaccines induce autism has been
widely blamed179 on a single article pub-
lished by Wakefield,180 but articles pub-
lished in scientific journals are unlikely to
sway public opinion. Even repeated publi-
cations regarding the dangers of acetamino-
phen for neural development, for example,
have had little impact on the use of acet-
aminophen in the pediatric population.
Rather, it is social networks that are more
likely to be persuasive. Acceptance of social
networks is deeply ingrained in the human
psyche,181 most likely because of their
ancient and critical importance for human
survival.182,183 Thus, parents of autistic chil-
dren are likely to believe that vaccines are
responsible for the induction of autism not
because of a peer-reviewed article but rather
because of their observations and the obser-
vations of individuals within their trusted
social networks. With this in mind, the story
of Steve Schultz is informative. He was
convinced that his son’s autism was induced
by a vaccine because of what was obvious to
him as an observer. Thus, Schultz’s work
both accounts for parents’ observations and
for the science surrounding the pathogenesis
of autism. Whatever the factor inducing the
development of autism, it is critical that the
424
Journal of International Medical Research 45(2)
 scientific community learns from its past
errors
in
ignoring
the
observations
of
parents.
It is estimated that the lifetime cost of
supporting an individual with autism is
currently US$2.4 million for an individual
that also has an intellectual disability, or
US$1.4 million for an individual with autism
but without an intellectual disability.184 It is
also estimated that 38% of individuals with
autism in the United States also have an
intellectual disability.185 This leads to an
overall average cost estimation of approxi-
mately US$1.8 million to support one child
with autism for his or her lifetime. We
estimate that the total cost of running a
definitive clinical study to test the connec-
tion
between
postnatal
acetaminophen
exposure and the induction of autism is
less than the cost of caring for three to five
individuals who have already developed
autism.
Conducting an ‘‘acetaminophen
withdrawal study’’: Practical
considerations
Given the already established adverse effects
of acetaminophen on the developing brain,
described above, and the known risk of
asthma following acetaminophen exposure,
it
seems
inappropriate
to
intentionally
expose anyone under the age of 5 years to
acetaminophen for the purpose of a medical
study. Rather, other approaches must be
considered. One approach involves large-
scale experiments in which acetaminophen
exposure is essentially eliminated until the
age at which a patient can be considered to
be at zero risk for regression into autism.
Such an ‘‘acetaminophen withdrawal study’’
would not be trivial. The feasibility of an
acetaminophen
withdrawal
study
was
previously examined for the purpose of
evaluating the connection between acet-
aminophen and asthma.186 However, that
feasibility study involved only 120 infants
admitted to hospital after birth, at a time
when some acetaminophen exposure may
have already happened (e.g. during circum-
cision). Further, the study allowed some use
of acetaminophen in all patients, and only
involved 3 months of restricted use in the
experimental population versus liberal use in
a control population. Complete withdrawal
up until the age of 5 years, on the other
hand, would require all forms (injectable,
oral, and suppository) of acetaminophen to
be prospectively identified and reduced to an
‘‘essential minimum,’’ if not eliminated. A
few thousand patients may need to be
enrolled, depending of course on the mag-
nitude of the anticipated effect. However,
fewer patients may be needed if at-risk
populations (e.g. preterm delivery, Down
syndrome) are selected for the study. The
practices associated with circumcision will
need to be reconsidered, and the use of acet-
aminophen during vaccinations, a common
but already highly questioned practice,187,188
would need to be eliminated. The possibility
of passing acetaminophen to nursing infants
and children through breast milk would also
need to be eliminated. Extensive education
of parents and a wide range of health-care
workers (pharmacists and all physicians and
nurses associated with obstetrics and pedi-
atrics) regarding the avoidance of acet-
aminophen would be necessary. Further,
comparable control groups with liberal use
(current standard) of acetaminophen would
need to be monitored simultaneously in
order
to
obtain
unequivocal
results.
Unfortunately,
follow-up
would
require
some time, and it would take years before
a result is obtained. However, it is hoped
that the weight of the current evidence will
be considered sufficient for a dramatic
reduction in acetaminophen use until inci-
sive studies are completed.
A primary concern with an acetamino-
phen-elimination experiment would be the
treatment of fever and pain. Alternative
pharmacological methods of treating pain
Parker et al.
425
 are available. Although all pharmacological
methods have drawbacks, acetaminophen is
not considered to be highly effective for pain
relief.189 Indeed, as stated by McCullough,
‘‘The few clinical studies of (acetaminophen)
and ibuprofen in children have struggled to
find objective measures of pain capable of
reliably distinguishing between active treat-
ment
and
placebo.’’189
Thus
it
seems
unwise to risk potentially permanent neuro-
logical injury for apparently ineffective pain
relief. Alternative pharmacological means
are also available for fever reduction, but
these have drawbacks. On the other hand,
traditional
methods
of
fever
reduction
(physical, non-pharmacological) look pro-
mising and have few side effects. However,
these may be less convenient for clinicians
and parents alike, and may prove ineffective
in some cases. At the same time, the specter
of inducing autism while treating pain or
fever
with
acetaminophen
should
be
weighed when considering the benefits of
using
acetaminophen,
even
in
dire
circumstances.
Given the current value attributed to the
therapeutic effects of acetaminophen, it is
worthwhile to consider possible ways to
utilize the drug in the pediatric population,
even if it is shown to be responsible for the
epidemic of autism. One possibility is that
individuals who are susceptible to acetami-
nophen-induced autism (e.g. perhaps those
whose mothers have excessively high levels
of vitamin B) might be identified, and use
of the drug in these individuals could be
avoided while others could benefit from
use of the drug. Another possibility is that
co-administration
of
N-acetyl
cysteine
(NAC) with acetaminophen could be used
to attenuate the toxic effects of acetamino-
phen in cases where the use of acetamino-
phen is
considered
highly desirable.
It
might be hypothesized that any insufficien-
cies in phase I or phase II metabolism
(Figure 3), which may lead to acetamino-
phen-induced autism, would be prevented
by co-administration of NAC. NAC works
both orally and parenterally, which may be
important since acetaminophen is available
for oral, intravenous, or rectal administra-
tion (Table 3). In patients with normal
liver and renal function, the half-life of
NAC is slightly longer than the half-life of
acetaminophen, so a single dose of NAC
may be sufficient to cover one dose of
acetaminophen. However, the respective
half-lives of the two compounds would
need to be evaluated in the treatment
population, and the idea that NAC may
be
protective
against
acetaminophen-
induced autism is speculative.
Education of medical professionals is
imperative for any acetaminophen with-
drawal study, given the current medical
environment. Acetaminophen use is cur-
rently ubiquitous and thought to be the
only humane approach to pain and fever
reduction for children from the time of birth
to 6 months. The drug is available in a very
wide range of formats for both prescription
and over-the-counter use (Table 3). Almost
one-quarter of all infants are given acet-
aminophen in any given week when in the
hospital, making it the number one medica-
tion used in infants.190 Given that most
medical professionals currently practicing
began their careers after 1982, it is not
surprising
that
acetaminophen
use
is
deeply engrained in practice and that alter-
natives may seem foreign and even primi-
tive. Further, the idea that acetaminophen
exposure in early childhood could be dan-
gerous is extremely novel and even disturb-
ing to most medical practitioners (personal
observation by co-author WP). Even the
best-trained pediatricians are generally una-
ware that the long-term effects of acetamino-
phen were never tested in children in
controlled trials.191 Further, with the excep-
tion of toxic metabolite production (Figure
3) that primarily affects liver function in
adults but not babies, most physicians are
largely unaware of the varied and complex

 effects of acetaminophen on the nervous
system and on metabolism. Few practi-
tioners are aware of the well-established
connection between asthma and acetamino-
phen use, and fewer still are aware of the
increased
possibility
of
cryptorchidism
(undescended testis) known to be associated
with acetaminophen use.192
The exceedingly common and widespread
use of acetaminophen both in the hospital
and at home may have led to some degree of
complacency in proper dose administration.
For example, in a study of outpatient care
prescription errors, 15% of children who
were prescribed acetaminophen were given a
dosage by medical professionals that was
higher
than
recommended.193
Similarly,
another study found that 12% of children
who were prescribed acetaminophen at a
pediatric emergency department were given
a prescription for acetaminophen higher
than the recommended dosage.194
Interestingly, Li et al.195 found that par-
ents
administered
acetaminophen
in
a
manner comparable to physicians; dosages
administered by parents exceeded recom-
mended amounts about 15% of the time. Li
et al.195 also noted that infants were more
likely than older children to be given an
inaccurate
dosage
of
acetaminophen
(RR ¼ 1.40, P < 0.04, CI 95% ¼ 1.06–1.86)
by their parents. This latter observation is
particularly concerning since it is during
infancy that the brain may be most sensitive
to damage by acetaminophen from oxida-
tive stress. However, it is unknown to what
extent acetaminophen-induced neuropath-
ology can be induced by the recommended
dose of the drug, and to what extent exces-
sive doses are responsible for the induction
of neurological disorders in the pediatric
population.
The bottom line is that hundreds of studies
describing the epidemiology of autism and
the numerous and varied risk factors for
autism have a straightforward explanation:
autism could be an acetaminophen-induced
brain injury facilitated by oxidative stress and
inflammation in newborns and young chil-
dren. This is certainly an attractive view from
an intellectual perspective, as it satisfies
Occam’s
razor.
Most
importantly,
this
model merits urgent testing because (a) it is
intuitive and accounts for the observations,
(b) the experiment to test the hypothesis is
very feasible, and (c) if proven correct, the
prevalence of autism in future generations
will be dramatically reduced. The urgency of
the issue cannot be underestimated, as pre-
cious time and resources that could be
allocated much more constructively and use-
fully in this time of serious need are being
poured into approaches that offer little to no
hope of prevention.
