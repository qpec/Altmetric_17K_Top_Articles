n 3 prior studies, a higher risk of death was observed among 
patients who had elective surgery on a Friday than earlier in the 
week.1–3 This “weekday effect” was most pronounced in a UK 
study, which reported a 44% increase in the risk of death among 
patients whose surgery took place on a Friday compared with Mon­
day.1 Yet the weekday effect is still a matter of debate, as are the pos­
sible mechanisms to explain it.3,4 It may be that senior surgeons pre­
fer to operate earlier in the week and tend to have better outcomes 
over a wide range of surgical procedures than less experienced sur­
geons.5 Friday surgeries also result in a greater proportion of post­
operative care occurring on the weekend, a time when there are 
fewer health care personnel in the hospital and less access to diag­
nostic services.6–12 
We investigated whether elective surgery performed later in 
the week was associated with a higher mortality than elective sur­
gery performed earlier in the week in a Canadian population and 
whether the association was influenced by surgeon experience 
and volume.
Methods
Study setting and design
Residents of the province of Ontario (2012 population 13.4 mil­
lion13) have universal access to hospital care and physician ser­
vices, and all eligible health care encounters are recorded in 
administrative databases. Relevant data sets were linked using 
unique, encoded identifiers and analyzed at the Institute for Clini­
cal Evaluative Sciences (ICES) Western site. The reporting of this 
study followed the REporting of studies Conducted using Observa­
tional Routinely­collected health Data (RECORD) statement (Table 
S1 in Appendix 1, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.160511/­/DC1).14
In this retrospective cohort study, we included all adult resi­
dents of Ontario who underwent 1 of 12 elective procedures from 
Apr. 1, 2002, to Dec. 31, 2012: esophagectomy or gastrectomy; 
pancreaticoduodenectomy; nephrectomy; cystectomy; partial 
liver resection; lobectomy or pneumonectomy; colorectal resec­

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: In prior studies, higher 
mortality was observed among pa­
tients who had elective surgery on a 
Friday rather than earlier in the week. 
We investigated whether mortality af­
ter elective surgery was associated 
with day of the week of surgery in a 
Can 
adian population and whether the 
association was influenced by surgeon 
experience and volume.
METHODS: We conducted a population­
based retrospective cohort study in the 
province of Ontario, Canada. We included 
adults who underwent 1 of 12 elective 
daytime surgical procedures from Apr. 1, 
2002, to Dec. 31, 2012. The primary out­
come was 30­day mortality. We used gen­
eralized estimating equations to compare 
outcomes for surgeries performed on dif­
ferent days of the week, adjusting for 
patient and surgeon factors.
RESULTS: A total of 402 899 procedures 
performed by 1691 surgeons met our 
inclusion criteria. The median length of 
hospital stay was 6 (interquartile range 
5–8) days. Surgeon experience varied 
significantly by day of week (p < 0.001), 
with surgeons operating on Fridays hav­
ing the least experience. Nearly all of the 
patients who had their procedure on a 
Friday had postoperative care on the 
weekend, as compared with 49.1% of 
those whose surgery was on a Monday 
(p < 0.001). We found no difference in 
the 30­day mortality between proce­
dures performed on Fridays and those 
performed on Mondays (adjusted odds 
ratio 1.08, 95% confidence interval 
0.97–1.21).
INTERPRETATION: Although surgeon 
experience differed across days of the 
week, the risk of 30­day mortality after 
elective surgery was similar regardless of 
which day of the week the procedure 
took place.

tion; total hip or knee replacement; coronary artery bypass graft 
surgery or aortic valve replacement; aortic aneurysm repair; lower 
limb revascularization; and carotid endarterectomy. (Procedure 
codes are available in Table S2 of Appendix 1.) We chose proce­
dures that are commonly done only electively and typically result 
in at least a 2­day hospital stay. We did not include outpatient 
procedures because they have limited in­hospital postoperative 
care and generally have lower mortality. 
We excluded patients if their procedure was performed outside 
of regular office hours (evening, weekend or holiday) or if they 
underwent more than 1 of the 12 index procedures on the same 
date (Table S3 in Appendix 1). For patients who underwent multi­
ple procedures during the study period, we included only the first 
procedure to retain a per­patient analysis.
Data sources
We obtained data on surgeon and patient characteristics from 5 
linked health care administrative databases. Diagnostic, proce­
dural and clinical patient data are recorded in the Canadian Insti­
tute for Health Information Discharge Abstract Database and Same 
Day Surgery databases, whereas health claims are recorded in the 
Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) database. The Registered 
Persons Database, which contains vital statistics for all residents of 
Ontario, was used to obtain patient demographic data, including 
age, sex and date of death. Physician demographic data, including 
age, years of practice and location of medical training, were 
retrieved from the ICES Physician Database. We determined hospi­
tal teaching status from a list of academic hospitals issued by 
Health Force Ontario.15
Outcome measures
The primary outcome was all­cause mortality within 30 days after 
the procedure date. Secondary outcomes included 2­day, 90­day 
and in­hospital all­cause mortality; length of hospital stay; admis­
sion to an intensive care unit (ICU) after the procedure; hospital 
readmission within 30 days after the procedure; and reoperation 
within 30 days after the procedure. Mortality data were obtained 
from the Registered Persons Database, OHIP billing records were 
used to identify reoperations, and the Discharge Abstract Data­
base was used to capture all other outcomes.
Covariates
Patient­related variables included age, sex, expected resource uti­
lization and socioeconomic status (approximated using the pa­
tients’ neighbourhood income quintile). We determined patients’ 
expected resource utilization using Resource Utilization Bands 
(RUBs), a component of the Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical 
Groups case­mix system.16 We categorized the expected resource 
utilization as low (RUB groups 0–3), moderate (RUB 4) or high 
(RUB 5). The Adjusted Clinical Groups system has been shown to 
predict mortality accurately using administrative data.17 Each pa­
tient­related variable was included because of its potential im­
pact on delay of intervention and surgical outcomes. 
To account for potential differences in the effect of day of the 
week among various surgical procedures and among different 
practice settings, we included type of procedure, year of proce­
dure and institution teaching status into our model. Given the 
impact of surgeon expertise on outcomes, we also recorded sur­
geons’ years of experience (estimated as years since medical 
school graduation, less 5 years to allow for residency) and annual 
procedure­specific volume (for that specific procedure, the total 
number performed during the fiscal year in question).
Statistical analyses
We assessed differences in patient­, surgeon­ and procedure­
related characteristics by day of the week in a univariable analysis 
using analysis of variance for continuous variables, the χ2 test for 
categorical variables and the nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test 
for non­normal continuous variables. 
We conducted multivariable analysis using multiple logistic 
regression to model the association between day of week and 
each of the primary and secondary outcomes (other than length 
of hospital stay). To account for the clustering effect of patients 
within surgeons and hospitals, we used generalized estimating 
equations with an exchangeable working correlation matrix.18 
For missing data, we used case­wise deletion. Data were missing 
only for the income quintile variable (n = 1293 [0.003%]); this 
variable was missing owing to incomplete administrative records 
and was likely missing completely at random.
We used restricted cubic splines with 5 knots to test the as­
sumption of linearity for each of the continuous covariates.19,20 Al­
though evidence of nonlinearity was observed, model estimates 
of odds ratios (ORs) where linearity was assumed were within 0.01 
of those produced when restricted cubic splines were used. Given 
the similarity of results between the 2 approaches, restricted cu­
bic splines were abandoned in favour of model simplicity and 
ease of interpretation.
In the primary analysis, day of week was modelled as a categor­
ical variable, with Monday as the reference group, an approach 
similar to that described by Aylin and colleagues.1 In sensitivity 
analyses, we investigated the impact of varying the day of week as 
the reference category. In the first sensitivity analysis, we col­
lapsed Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday into a single reference 
group and compared it with each of Thursday and Friday. In a sec­
ond post hoc sensitivity analysis, Monday and Friday were col­
lapsed and compared with the combined reference category of 
Tuesday through Thursday. All of the primary and sensitivity anal­
yses were performed with data for the entire study population.
We performed subgroup analyses (planned a priori) to deter­
mine whether the association between the day of week and the 
outcomes was modified by the specific procedure performed or 
the procedure risk. We defined high­risk procedures as those 
with a greater than 2% risk of death within 30 days, as observed 
in the current study. We performed an additional subgroup anal­
ysis (planned post hoc) that was restricted to patients with a low 
level of complexity (RUB groups 0–3). The purpose of this analy­
sis was to assess the potential impact of differing levels of com­
plexity across days of the week as well as the potential impact of 
referring more challenging patients to more senior surgeons. We 
also conducted an unadjusted analysis examining the associa­
tion between surgeons’ years of experience and 30­day mortal­
ity. We examined differences in the proportion of patients for

end by day of surgery using a Cochran–Armitage test for trend. 
Odds ratios can be interpreted as relative risks (appropriate 
given the incidences observed).
All analyses were conducted with the use of SAS version 9.3 
(PROC GENMOD; SAS Institute).

Results
Patient and surgeon characteristics
A total of 402 899 procedures (50.6% in men) performed by 1691 
different surgeons met our inclusion criteria. The median length of 
hospital stay after surgery was 6 (interquartile range 5–8) days. 
The greatest number of surgeries was performed on Tuesdays (n = 
95 654) and the least on Fridays (n = 65 139). Patient age, sex and 
expected resource utilization category varied little by day of the 
week (Table 1). Hip and knee replacements accounted for more 
than half (57.7%) of the procedures, colorectal resection for 11.6% 
and coronary artery bypass graft surgery or aortic valve replace­
ment for 11.2%.
Surgeon experience differed significantly by the day of week 
(p < 0.001). Experience was highest on Tuesdays and Wednesdays 
(on average 19 yr in practice) and lowest on Mondays and Fridays 
(on average 16 yr in practice). The proportion of surgeons who 
were operating in their first 5 years of practice was nearly twice as 
high on Fridays as on Tuesdays (11.1% v. 5.7%; Figure 1). The 
median annual procedure volume also differed significantly by the 
day of week (p < 0.001) and was highest for surgeons who oper­
ated on Tuesdays (80 cases) and lowest on Fridays (72 cases) 
(Table 1). Unadjusted analysis of the effect of surgeon experience 
on 30­day mortality did not show a significant association 
(OR 1.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00–1.01).

Effect on mortality and other outcomes
The overall 30­day mortality was 0.84%. There was no consistent 
association between the day of week of the surgery and 30­day 
mortality in the unadjusted and adjusted analyses for the overall 
cohort when Friday was compared with Monday (adjusted OR 1.08, 
95% CI 0.97–1.21) (Table 2). Similarly, the risk of any of the second­
ary outcomes was not consistently higher on Friday than on other 
days of the week (Table 3). There was no difference in the adjusted 
odds of 30­day readmission (adjusted OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.98–1.06) or 
30­day reoperation (adjusted OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.90–1.02) when Fri­
day was compared with Monday. The risk of ICU admission was 
slightly higher on Friday than on Monday (adjusted OR 1.07, 95% CI 
1.02–1.12). The median length of hospital stay was shorter for 
patients whose surgery was performed on a Monday than for those 
whose surgery was on another day of the week (5 v. 6 d).
In subgroup analyses in which we examined each type of proce­
dure separately, we found no consistent association between the day 
of the week of surgery and 30­day mortality across multiple types of 
procedures (Table S4 in Appendix 1). Similarly, there was no associa­
tion between the day of week and 30­day mortality when the pro­
cedures were classified as low risk or high risk 
(Table S5 in Appendix 1). The results for the cohort 
restricted to patients with a low level of complexity 
(RUB groups 0–3) were consistent with results from 
the primary analysis (data not shown).
Changing the categorization of day of week to 
(a) Monday through Wednesday versus either 
Thursday or Friday or (b) combining Monday and 
Friday and comparing them with to the remain­
ing 3 days of the week combined showed no dif­
ference in the association with 30­day mortality 
(Table S6 in Appendix 1).
Interpretation
More than 300 million elective surgeries are per­
formed worldwide each year.1,21 If it is true that a 
person’s risk of death is higher if their elective

surgery is on a Friday compared with earlier in the week, this 
would have important implications for informed consent and pub­
lic health. We hypothesized that less experienced surgeons would 
operate on a Friday compared with other days of the week. Our 
study showed this to be true, perhaps because senior surgeons 
prefer to operate mid­week in an effort to limit their clinical obliga­
tions related to postoperative care on the weekend. Reassuringly, 
we found no association between day of the week of surgery and 
the outcomes of elective surgery. This lack of association was 
observed in the unadjusted and adjusted analyses in the entire 
study cohort, and in subgroups defined by the type of surgery and 
the risk of surgery.
Our findings are in contrast to those of Aylin and colleagues1 
in their analysis of UK data showing a 44% increase in 30­day 
mortality following elective surgery occurring on Friday when 
compared with Monday. This discrepancy is even more striking 
when you consider that their study also included lower risk 
groups, and it had a crude rate of death similar to the rate in our 
study (6.7 per 1000 and 8.4 per 1000, respectively). In a follow­up 
paper, their group also showed that less experienced consultants 
operate on Fridays compared with earlier in the week; however, 
the difference was less marked (7.9 v. 8.5 median years of experi­
ence) than in our study, and differences in consultant seniority 
did not have an impact on either mortality or the association 
between the day of the week and mortality.22 Our results in com­
bination with those of Aylin’s group point to other causes for the 
weekday effect than variations in surgeon experience.
A global comparative study examining variation in mortality 
following elective surgery showed that the presence of a weekday 
effect was not consistent across the countries studied (England, 
Australia, United States and the Netherlands).3 The Netherlands 
showed a strong weekday effect, whereas Australia showed little 
effect. In combination with our results, these findings suggest 
that variation in mortality following elective surgery over the 
course of the week likely represents differences in process of care 
and other organizational factors that differ between health care 
systems, such as hand­off procedures for patient care, staffing 
levels, availability of consulting services or diagnostic studies, 
access to specialized treatments and clinical acuity (worsening 
symptoms, impending complications).1,3,23
Although many studies have identified a weekday or weekend 
effect, few have attempted to discern the mechanisms behind it. 
Patients who have elective surgery on a Friday have a larger pro­
portion of their postoperative care occurring on weekends, com­
pared with patients who have their procedure earlier in the week. 
Previous studies investigating the effect of hospital staffing levels 
have shown that hospitals with lower levels of staffing on the 
weekend have higher rates of death following emergent weekend 
admissions.12,24,25 Reduced weekend availability of interventional 
therapies, such as endoscopies for urgent bleeding, cardiac cath­
eterizations for myocardial infarctions and thrombolysis for 
stroke, has also been found to be associated with increased mor­
tality.6,7,26–29 Variability in the availability of diagnostic and thera­
peutic services during weekends and variations in hospital staff­

ing levels across different health care systems likely explain the 
inconsistency of the weekday effect.
We chose not to include patients undergoing surgery on week­
ends in our analysis. In Canada, surgical procedures that occur on 
the weekend likely represent an emergent or semi­urgent clinical 
situation (e.g., colon cancer with bowel obstruction or symptom­
atic aortic aneurysm), which would carry an increased risk of ad­
verse events when compared with truly elective cases. This notion 
is supported by McIsaac and colleagues,23 who found that patients 
within a Can 
adian population who had “elective” surgery on the 
weekend differed systematically from those whose elective sur­
gery was on a weekday.
Limitations
Our study has several limitations associated with the use of admin­
istrative data. We linked the surgeons to procedures via billing 
records but did not account for the potential influence of trainees. 
However, we did adjust for institution teaching status. 
Missing data are a concern for all research based on adminis­
trative data. For our study, it seems unlikely that data would be 
missing differentially by day of the week of surgery; therefore, we 
did not expect a meaningful bias due to missing data. 
Although we adjusted for several patient and surgeon factors, 
the databases did not contain variables such as laboratory values, 
symptomatic status or specific indications for surgery. Conse­
quently, our ability to capture patients’ baseline level of risk accu­
rately was limited and may have resulted in residual confounding. 
However, concern regarding this issue should be mitigated by re­
sults from the subgroup analysis restricted to patients with a low 
level of complexity, which were similar to those obtained for the 
full cohort. 
Despite these limitations, the accuracy of administrative data 
to predict mortality has been shown to approach that of clinical 
databases.30 Although we did not observe a weekday effect in our 
study, inclusion of different procedures or a larger sample might 
have yielded a significant difference in surgical outcomes by the 
day of the week of surgery. Nevertheless, given the size of our 
study and the relatively low observed point estimates, it seems 
unlikely that we failed to detect any clinically meaningful 
associations.
Conclusion
Our study showed that the risk of 30­day mortality after elective 
surgery was similar regardless of which day of the week the pro­
cedure took place. The results should be reassuring to adminis­
trators, policy­makers and the public in Ontario. We did find that 
less experienced surgeons and those with slightly lower annual 
procedure volumes tended to operate more frequently on Mon­
days and Fridays, whereas more senior surgeons tended to oper­
ate mid­week. Regardless, these variations in surgeon experience 
and volume did not appear to contribute to any potential week­
day effect on mortality. That our findings differ from those of pre­
vious studies suggests that the weekday effect is not a universal 
phenomenon across all health care systems and that the factors 
responsible for this effect are likely correctable in jurisdictions 
where it occurs. Future studies aimed at discerning the mecha­
nisms behind the weekday effect should examine differences in 
processes of care and other organizational factors across health 
care systems.
