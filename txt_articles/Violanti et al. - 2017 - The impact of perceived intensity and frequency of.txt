Abstract
Police officers encounter unpredictable, evolving, and escalating stressful demands in their work. 
Utilizing the Spielberger Police Stress Survey (60-item instrument for assessing specific 
conditions or events considered to be stressors in police work), the present study examined the 
association of the top five highly rated and bottom five least rated work stressors among police 
officers with their awakening cortisol pattern. Participants were police officers enrolled in the 
Buffalo Cardio-Metabolic Occupational Police Stress (BCOPS) study (n = 338). For each group, 
the total stress index (product of rating and frequency of the stressor) was calculated. Participants 
collected saliva by means of Salivettes at four time points: on awakening, 15, 30 and 45 min after 
waking to examine the cortisol awakening response (CAR). Saliva samples were analyzed for free 
cortisol concentrations. A slope reflecting the awakening pattern of cortisol over time was 
estimated by fitting a linear regression model relating cortisol in log-scale to time of collection. 
The slope served as the outcome variable. Analysis of covariance, regression, and repeated

 measures models were used to determine if there was an association of the stress index with the 
waking cortisol pattern. There was a significant negative linear association between total stress 
index of the five highest stressful events and slope of the awakening cortisol regression line (trend 
p-value = 0.0024). As the stress index increased, the pattern of the awakening cortisol regression 
line tended to flatten. Officers with a zero stress index showed a steep and steady increase in 
cortisol from baseline (which is often observed) while officers with a moderate or high stress 
index showed a dampened or flatter response over time. Conversely, the total stress index of the 
five least rated events was not significantly associated with the awakening cortisol pattern. The 
study suggests that police events or conditions considered highly stressful by the officers may be 
associated with disturbances of the typical awakening cortisol pattern. The results are consistent 
with previous research where chronic exposure to stressors is associated with a diminished 
awakening cortisol response pattern.

1. Introduction
Over the course of what may ultimately be a decades long career police officers are 
repeatedly exposed to conditions and incidents unique to their job that they may perceive 
and respond to as stressful (North et al., 2002; Paton, 2005; Paton et al., 2009). With little or 
no warning, officers may find themselves responding to events ranging from domestic 
disturbances to involvement in complex, evolving natural disasters or acts of terrorism. 
Events at the more challenging end of the critical incident spectrum (e.g., terrorist acts, 
shootings, assaults) result in officers encountering, over periods of several days or weeks, 
unpredictable, evolving, and escalating demands (Paton and Violanti, 2007). Further, the 
burden of societal responsibility and strict legal norms are placed on officers as they deal 
with these demands. One may surmise that police officers are often in a state of 
psychological inflexibility faced with a multitude of difficult and challenging work demands.
1.1. Perceived stress and biological change
In general, the perception of an event or condition as a stressor triggers the response of 
several biological systems to aid the body in dealing with the stressor. Primary among them 
is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis which responds to a stressor by releasing 
cortisol, the species-specific hormone in man from the adrenal gland. The cortisol response 
is frequently used as a biomarker of HPA axis status or function. The axis acts in a classic 
negative feedback fashion where the circulating cortisol acts to “shut-off” the signals that 
trigger the response allowing a return to homeostasis. The return to homeostasis confers 
stability to the system through change or allostasis (McEwen, 1998, 2007, 2008; McEwen 
and Wingfield, 2003). It seems intuitive that, repeated or sustained activation of the HPA 
axis may cause an increase in the allostatic load, the unwanted “wear-and-tear” on the 
system that occurs with the need to constantly respond to various stressors. The constant 
adaptation of the HPA axis to various demands may ultimately result in pathological 
function of the HPA axis where the response is exaggerated or minimal. This alteration in

 the response of HPA axis may be reflected in the pattern of the cortisol secretion or the 
amount of the hormone. For example, in a non-compromised functioning of HPA axis the 
CAR is characterized by a pronounced peak in cortisol shortly after awakening which 
gradually diminishes over the next 30 to 40 min. Here, we hypothesized that the constant 
need for police officers to respond to a variety of stressors may compromise the functioning 
of HPA axis and be reflected in a disturbed CAR pattern.
To our knowledge, no recent study has examined the effect of the perceived intensity of 
stressors and the frequency of occurrence in police work on the CAR pattern. We 
hypothesize in the present study that the perceived intensity of specific police work stressors 
as most stressful (high) or least stressful (low) will have a differential effect on the 
awakening cortisol patterns among police officers.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study population
Study participants for the current analyses were officers enrolled in the Buffalo Cardio-
Metabolic Occupational Police Stress (BCOPS) study. The BCOPS study was a cross-
sectional study aimed at investigating the associations of occupational stressors experienced 
in police work with the psychological and physiological health of police officers. A total of 
710 police officers who worked at the Buffalo Police Department in New York were invited 
to participate in the BCOPS study; 464 (65.4%) officers agreed to participate and were 
examined during the period of June 4, 2004 to October 2, 2009. No specific inclusion 
criteria were indicated for the study, only that participants be sworn police officers and 
willing to participate. Comparisons of available demographic variables (sex, age, and police 
rank) showed no significant differences between participants and non-participants. A written 
informed consent was collected from each participant. Data collection was performed at The 
Center for Preventive Medicine, State University of New York at Buffalo. The study was 
approved by the Internal Review Board of the State University of New York at Buffalo, and 
the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Human Subjects Review 
Board (IRB).
2.2. Police stressor measure
Evaluation of various incidents and conditions as possible stressors experienced in police 
work were assessed by the study participants using the Spielberger Police Stress Survey. The 
Spielberger Police Stress Survey is a 60-item instrument for assessing the possible stressors 
in police work (Spielberger et al., 1981). For each item, the officer rates the perceived 
stressfulness of experiencing the event on a scale from 0 to 100 (0 = no stress, 100 = 
maximum stress). The officer also provides the frequency of occurrence of each event over 
the past month (total occurrences in past month) and past year (total occurrences in past 
year). The instrument has three subscales: administrative and organizational pressure (23 
items), which includes satisfaction with departmental policies and procedures, performance, 
fairness of rewards, and the judicial system; physical and psychological threat (24 items), 
which includes dangerous situations and experiences such as killing someone in the line of 
duty; and lack of support (13 items), which includes political pressures and relationships

 with supervisor and coworkers. The subscales have acceptable internal consistency 
(Cronbach’s alpha > 0.90).
Of the 60 items, the five highest and five lowest rated stressful events were selected by 
ranking each item using the mean rating of stressfulness from all officers. For each of the 10 
selected items (the 5 most stressful and the 5 least stressful), a stress index was derived by 
multiplying the rating of stressfulness by the corresponding frequency of occurrence in the 
past month (stress index = rating × occurrence). The stress index is therefore a weighted 
average of frequency of occurrence where the ratings of stressfulness were used as weights. 
For each group (top five and bottom five), the total stress index was calculated by summing 
the stress indices of the five events that belong within each group. The total stress index for 
the top five most stressful events (herein called the “major stress index”) and the total stress 
index for the bottom five least stressful events (herein called “minor stress index”) served as 
the primary exposure variables of interest (measure of police stress) for the current analyses.
2.3. Salivary cortisol measures
To assess the salivary CAR pattern, subjects were instructed to collect saliva samples 
immediately after awakening, and 15, 30, and 45 min thereafter. The saliva samples were 
collected during a single day and occurred the day after the clinic examination. Officers 
were provided with Salivettes (Sarstedt, USA), a commercially available collection device 
consisting of a dental roll and a centrifuge tube, for the collection of saliva samples. 
Participants were asked to refrain from taking stimulant medication, smoking, eating and 
drinking, and brushing their teeth before completing salivary sampling to avoid 
contamination of saliva with food or blood caused my microinjuries of the oral cavity. At the 
designated collection time, the officers removed the dental roll from the centrifuge tube and 
placed it in their mouth for approximately two minutes allowing for saturation of the roll. 
The roll was then returned to the tube and samples were returned to the clinic and 
subsequently sent to the laboratory of DBM. Upon delivery the tubes were centrifuged to 
provide a non-viscous saliva sample for assay of cortisol. Samples were maintained at 
−20 °C until sent to the Technical University of Dresden for analysis of cortisol by a 
commercially available chemiluminescence immunoassay (IBL, Hamburg, Germany). The 
four cortisol values from the saliva samples and the corresponding times of collection were 
used to estimate a slope reflecting the awakening pattern over time and served as the 
outcome measure of interest in the current analyses.
2.4. Assessment of covariates
Questionnaires were administered to collect demographic and lifestyle characteristics 
including age, gender, race/ethnicity, years of police service, police rank, years of education, 
marital status, smoking status, and alcohol consumption. Height and weight were measured 
with shoes removed and recorded to the nearest half centimeter and rounded up to the 
nearest quarter of a pound, respectively. Height and weight were converted to meters and 
kilograms, respectively. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms 
divided by height in meters squared.

 2.5. Statistical analysis
Of the 464 BCOPS study participants, only officers with complete data on the exposure 
variables of interest (major and minor stress indices), and cortisol values from the four 
waking saliva samples and their corresponding times of collection were used for statistical 
analyses (n = 338). The possible association between the stress indices (exposure variable) 
and the awakening cortisol pattern (outcome variable) was examined using two methods 
(analysis of covariance and repeated measures analysis). Due to the skewed nature of the 
cortisol concentration in the awakening saliva samples, values were log-transformed prior to 
analyses in both statistical approaches. Analysis of covariance was used to compare mean 
slopes of regression lines fitted to the waking cortisol pattern across tertiles of the stress 
indices. A slope reflecting the awakening pattern of cortisol over time was first estimated by 
fitting a simple linear regression model for each participant, where the cortisol values (in 
log-scale) were regressed on time of collection.
The slope served as the outcome variable of interest in the analysis of covariance. In 
addition, a regression model relating the slope of the CAR pattern to the continuous forms of 
the stress indices was fitted to assess a linear trend in slope across increasing values of stress 
indices. In the second approach, repeated measures analyses were used to examine 
differences in awakening cortisol pattern over time across the three categories (tertiles) of 
stress indices. A model relating the cortisol values (in log-scale) to time of collection 
(defined as time since awakening in minutes), tertiles of stress indices, and the interaction 
between time and tertiles of stress indices was fit. The statistical significance of the 
interaction term was used to determine whether the CAR pattern depended on stress 
categories (tertiles). The MIXED procedure in SAS was used to model the repeated 
measures by applying the autoregressive covariance structure as a model for correlations 
among repeated measurements made on the same subject. In all analyses, adjustment for 
potential confounding factors including age, gender, marital status, alcohol consumption, 
and police rank were made. Prior to statistical adjustment, all covariates were tested for 
potential effect modification by including an interaction term between the exposure and the 
covariate. The statistical analyses were performed using the SAS software version 9.3 (SAS 
Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) and significance level was set at 5%.
3. Results
3.1. Participant demographic and lifestyle characteristics
The demographic and lifestyle characteristics of the study participants (n = 338) are 
presented in Table 1. The study population consists of 78% males and the majority was 
white (79%), married (77%), and had a rank of patrol officer (65%). The mean age was 42.9 
years (range: 27–74 years). The distribution of demographic and lifestyle characteristics of 
the participants did not vary significantly across tertiles of the major stress index except for 
police rank, age, and years of service (Table 2). Officers in the lowest stress index category 
had a greater proportion of higher ranking officers (53%) and a smaller proportion of patrol 
officers (47%) compared to those in the middle and highest tertiles of major stress index. In 
addition, those in the lowest stress index category were significantly older (46.2 ± 9.0 years) 
and had longer years of service (20.2 ± 8.4) compared to officers in the middle or highest

 stress index tertiles. Comparisons across tertiles of the minor stress index yielded similar 
findings (data not shown).
3.2. Police work events rated as most and least stressful
Based on rating of stressfulness on a scale of 0 to 100, the top five most stressful events 
(major stressors) were: exposure to battered or dead children (mean rating = 64.6), killing 
someone in the line of duty (62.9), fellow officer killed in the line of duty (62.4), situations 
requiring the use of force (56.8), and physical attack on one’s person (56.1) (Table 3). All 
five belong to the Physical/Psychological danger sub-scale of the instrument. The mean 
frequency of occurrence in the past month for the major stressors ranged from 0.01 (killing 
someone in the line of duty; range: 0–2) to 1.5 (situations requiring the use of force; range: 
0–10). The combined mean frequency of occurrence for the major stressors was 2.4 times 
per month (range: 0–19), indicating an officer on average experienced the major stressors 
2.4 times during the past month. The stress indices (a measure that combines the frequency 
of occurrence of the event with its rating of stressfulness) varied from 0.06 (killing someone 
in the line of duty) to 89.7 (situations requiring the use of force).
The bottom five least stressful events (minor stressors) were: strained relations with non-
police friends (mean rating = 25.5), lack of participation on policy-making decisions (24.9), 
periods of inactivity and boredom (19.3), promotion or commendation (16.8), and 
performing non-police tasks (16.4). Periods of inactivity and boredom was the most 
frequently occurring event (mean occurrence = 2.7) and had the highest stress index while 
promotion or commendation was the least prevalent (0.1 times in the past month) and also 
had the lowest stress index.
3.3. Most stressful events and the awakening cortisol pattern
Comparisons of the mean slope of the regression line fitted to the log-transformed CAR 
pattern across tertiles of the major stress index are shown in Table 4 (top panel). The results 
from the unadjusted model indicate that the mean slopes of the awakening pattern differed 
significantly across the stress index categories (low stress: 0.0174 ± 0.034, moderate stress: 
0.0067 ± 0.031, high stress: 0.0060 ± 0.025, p-value for difference = 0.0070). Further 
pairwise multiple comparison tests showed that the mean slopes for the moderate and high 
stress index categories were significantly smaller compared to the mean slope of officers in 
the lowest stress index tertile. Note that the first tertile contains officers with zero stress 
index (meaning the stress score or the frequency of occurrence or both were reported as 
zero). Trend analysis where the mean slope was regressed against the continuous form of the 
stress index also indicates a significant linear association between major stress index and 
slope of the wakening cortisol regression line (trend p-value = 0.0244). These results show 
that as the major stress index increases, the slope of the wakening cortisol line tends to 
decrease approaching zero (indicative of dampened or flatter CAR profile). Further 
adjustment for age, gender, marital status, alcohol consumption and rank only slightly 
attenuated the association. Results were consistent when we also controlled for medication 
use, smoking status, and phase of menstrual cycle (low stress: 0.00173 ± 0.003, moderate 
stress: 0.0070 ± 0.003, high stress: 0.0069 ± 0.003, p-value = 0.0210). Further adjustment 
for time of awakening and sleep quality only slightly attenuated the association of interest.

 A repeated measures analysis was conducted to test if the pattern of awakening cortisol over 
time differed by levels (tertiles) of major stress index (Fig. 1). The figure shows that 
although the total hormonal output did not differ among the three groups (p = 0.7985), there 
was a significant difference in the pattern of cortisol over time (interaction p-value for time 
by stress category: 0.0078 for the unadjusted model and 0.0039 for the multivariate adjusted 
model). Those with zero major stress index showed a steep and steady increase in cortisol 
from baseline while officers with moderate and high major stress index showed a dampened 
response over time (relative to those with zero stress index). The result from repeated 
measures analysis is consistent with the mean slope comparison approach presented in Table 
4 where the four repeated measurements were reduced to a single estimate.
3.4. Least stressful events and the awakening cortisol pattern
The mean slope of the awakening cortisol pattern did not differ significantly across tertiles 
of the minor stress index (Table 4 bottom panel). The results from the unadjusted model 
indicate that the mean slopes were similar across the three minor stress index categories (low 
stress: 0.0081 ± 0.031, moderate stress: 0.0120 ± 0.031, high stress: 0.0103 ± 0.030, p-value 
for difference = 0.6403). The result from the trend analysis (trend p-value = 0.8610) also 
indicates absence of a significant linear association between minor stress index and slope of 
the wakening cortisol pattern. In addition, the results from the repeated measures analysis 
indicate that the pattern of awakening cortisol over time did not differ significantly across 
tertiles of minor stress index (Fig. 2). The Figure shows that the awakening cortisol pattern 
is similar regardless of the level of minor stress index (interaction p-value for time by stress 
category: 0.7892 for the unadjusted model and 0.8972 for the multivariate adjusted model). 
The pattern for each of the three groups is consistent where awakening cortisol levels rise 
peaking around 30 min after awakening and followed by a gradual decline.
Finally, in order to assess the relative impact of the major vs. the minor stressors on the slope 
of the awakening cortisol pattern, we fit a multiple regression model relating the slope to 
both types of stressors in the same model adjusting for covariates. The result showed a 
significant negative association between the slope and major stress index (standardized 
regression coefficient = −0.118, p-value = 0.0427) while the association with the minor 
stress index was not statistically significant (standardized regression coefficient = 0.020, p-
value = 0.7317).
4. Discussion
The present study examined the possible association of the major and minor stressors from 
the Spielberger Police Stress Survey with the CAR pattern. Results indicated a significant 
negative association between the stress index of the top five most stressful events and slope 
of the CAR pattern. As the highly rated stress index increased, the pattern tended to flatten 
over time. Officers with zero stress index showed a steep and steady increase in cortisol 
from baseline while officers with moderate and high stress index showed a dampened or 
flatter response over time (relative to those with zero stress index). Conversely, the stress 
index of the five least stressful events was not significantly associated with changes in the 
awakening cortisol pattern. Direct comparison of the two groups of stressors indicated that

 the most stressful events had significantly larger impact on the waking cortisol pattern 
relative to the least stressful events.
The results suggest that officers who perceive certain events associated with police work as 
highly stressful may have a blunting of the awakening cortisol pattern and this blunting may 
represent an alteration in the functioning of the HPA axis relative to officers who do not 
perceive these events as stressful. To some degree, the blunted CAR pattern observed here 
may be related to the traumatic or violent nature of the highly rated stressors perceived by 
officers. Four of the five top rated stressors involved acts of violence which represented a 
direct threat to the officer’s safety. A fifth stressor, witnessing battered or dead children, 
represented feelings of the lack of control over such violent events. Dickerson and Kemeny 
(2004) comment that cortisol secretion is highly affected under conditions of physical self-
preservation and safety. Previous work has demonstrated that such highly stressful incidents 
may initiate a lower or blunted cortisol response. Wessa et al. (2006) found a blunting of 
awakening cortisol in PTSD compared to controls. Yehuda (2002) found that the biologic 
alterations observed in trauma stress do not uniformly resemble those associated with other 
types of stress. Cortisol levels were found to be lower than normal in studies of patients with 
traumatic stress, even decades after a traumatic event.
Several studies have looked at the association between stress and cortisol in police officers. 
Groer et al. (2010) examined simulated critical incident police scenarios and the association 
with cortisol secretion. They observed a higher cortisol elevation in officers during a higher 
stress scenario. Walvekar et al. (2015) found an association between perceived stress and 
increased secretion of cortisol among police officers. Violanti et al. (2009) found increased 
cortisol secretion after awakening was independently associated with impaired brachial 
artery flow mediated dilation in female but not male police officers indicating a possible link 
between HPA axis cortisol response and subclinical cardiovascular disease in female 
officers. Wirth et al. (2014) examined the effect of shift work on cortisol levels among police 
officers and found that awakening cortisol AUC (Area Under the Curve) values were lower 
among officers working short-term night or afternoon shifts than day shifts, with maximal 
differences occurring after five days of shiftwork. Cortisol values were attenuated among 
officers with more shift changes. Austin-Ketch et al. (2012) found noticeable differences in 
levels of measurable cortisol present across the varying levels of traumatic stress symptoms 
in police officers.
Debate exists about the relationship between the various types of circumstances and events 
that result in HPA axis activation and cortisol release (Dickerson and Kemeny, 2004). 
According to these authors, different types of stressful situations may not affect cortisol 
secretions in a similar manner. Several authors comment that unpredictable, uncontrollable, 
threatening or novel situations may likely elicit a stronger activation of the HPA axis and the 
subsequent cortisol response. Police officers quite often experience these types of stressors. 
(Sapolsky et al., 2000; Blascovich and Mendes, 2000). It is therefore likely that the response 
to police stressors and their effect on cortisol can, to some degree, be attributed to the type 
and perceived intensity of the stressor by the individual officer (Skoluda et al., 2015; Bosch 
et al., 2009). This is what Skoluda et al. (2015) termed “stimulus response specificity”.

 The five high stressors in this study have been observed in police work. In 2015, 123 officers 
were killed in the line of duty (Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2014a,b http://
www.nleomf.org/facts/officer-fatalities-data/year.html). Another highly rated but not 
prevalent (0.27%) stressor was killing someone in the line of duty (Violanti et al., 2007). 
Similar to experiencing the death of a fellow officer, being involved in a shooting and killing 
someone can be a very stressful for officers (Bond et al., 2014). The aftermath of a shooting 
can lead to scrutiny by both the department and the judicial system concerning the legality 
of the shooting and the proper use of justifiable deadly physical force by the officer. 
Additionally, PTSD may result from involvement in shooting incidents (Paton et al., 2006).
Situations requiring use of force (58.5%) was a prevalent and highly rated stressor (Violanti 
et al., 2007). On average, over the last decade (2004–2013), there have been 57,346 assaults 
against law enforcement each year, resulting in 15,375 injuries (http://www.nleomf.org/
facts/officer-fatalities-data/daifacts.html). In 2014, there were 48,315 officers assaulted at a 
rate of 9.0 per 100 officers (FBI Uniform Crime Reports, 2014, https://www.fbi.gov/
aboutus/cjis/ucr/leoka/2014/tables/
table_71_leos_asltd_region_and_geographic_division_2014.xls). Of these assaults, 1950 
were by firearm, 951 by knife, 6803 by other dangerous weapons, and 38,611 by personal 
weapons (e.g. hands, fists or feet). Over one-quarter (28.3%) of these assaults resulted in 
injury to the officer (FBI Uniform Crime Reports, https://www.fbi.gov/aboutus/cjis/ucr/
leoka/2014/tables/
table_76_leos_asltd_type_of_weapon_and_percent_injured_2005-2014.xls).
Exposure to battered or dead children was a highly ranked stressor (Table 3). Involvement 
with child crimes is a difficult task for police officers and it requires a special ability and 
social support in order to avoid traumatization. Prior research regarding police investigations 
of children related crimes such as neglect, homicide, or sexual abuse suggest that officers are 
often at greater risk for developing secondary traumatic stress (Krause, 2013; Chouliara et 
al., 2009; Powell and Tomyn, 2011). Officers working these cases may also be at risk for 
depression and anxiety (Powell and Guadagno, 2013; Russ et al., 2009).
Strengths of the present study include the collection of data using standardized protocols and 
equipment and performed at the same time at a clinic site by trained staff. The Spielberger 
Police Stress Survey is a well validated frequently used instrument to study specific police 
stressors. All samples were subject to quality control. In addition, we were able to adjust the 
association of interest for a wide variety of potential confounder including age, gender, 
marital status, alcohol consumption, rank, medication use, smoking status, contraceptive use, 
phase of menstrual cycle, time of awakening, and sleep quality.
Limitations of this study include a cross-sectional study design, which precludes causal 
inferences and concern for generalizability to other police departments. Future longitudinal 
designs would be beneficial to better understand changes in perceptions of stressors over 
time and the factors associated with such changes. While our sample size is adequate, the 
procurement of larger samples, especially women officers, would be beneficial in helping to 
disentangle gender differences. The waking saliva samples were collected for only one-day 
which limits reliability. We were not able to adjust for sexual activity, menstrual cycle phase,

 and menstrual cycle regularity. As with any self-report survey instrument, recall bias may be 
a factor.
The present study examines only how HPA axis responds to the awakening condition and the 
association between the CAR and how an officer perceives events experienced in police 
work. Although we see an association between a high stress index and a blunting of the 
CAR, it is not certain that this is due to the experiences of the officers in policing. Officers 
may have responded differently in the field to these events and we do not know the status of 
their HPA axis when they entered the police force. More information would obtained if 
police officers were followed from the time they were recruits across their careers. It is 
really the only way to determine if police work alters the status and operation of the HPA 
axis assessed by the CAR or other conditions/challenges across the length of their careers.
There is more work to be done in this occupation that is replete with exposure to a variety of 
events and conditions that can be considered stressors. However, the effects of stressors on 
cortisol are highly variable (Gaab et al., 2005) and it is commonly accepted that stressors 
can be perceived differently by different people (Lazarus, 1999). Additionally there may be 
forces in police work specific to the occupation which determines the perception of what is 
stressful. Police officers share a cohesive cultural bond which may influence perceptions of 
stress on the job (Paton et al., 2009). Semmer et al. (2005) comment that shared meaning is 
one element by which cultures are defined and this influences the appraisal of stress, and 
that the probability that a given situation is appraised as stressful will be different in 
different cultures. Under influence of the cohesive police culture, the probability of 
collective stress reactions is increased and may develop into specific occupational stress 
factors (Levi, 2005). Webster (2014) proposed that it is necessary to assess the importance of 
cognitive appraisal, coping, and person-environment fit as well as stressors in police work. 
Automatically labelling work demands as stressful in policing is to assume that an officer 
appraises it as such. Gaab et al. (2005) comment that HPA activation is more strongly 
associated with what will happen due to a stressor as opposed to what did happen. We hope 
to address this question in our future work with prospective analysis of cortisol secretion 
based on changes over an extended period of time.
In conclusion, the present study provides some clues as to which stressors in police work are 
associated with the CAR. Further work utilizing additional cortisol challenges may yield 
important additional information. These may be useful in determining which particular 
stressors should be the focus of intervention. Psychological support and timely interventions 
are important to help officers deal with stress and possible biological consequences in the 
occupation of policing.
