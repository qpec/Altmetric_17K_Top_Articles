Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Professionally delivered integrated pest management (IPM) interventions can 
reduce home mouse allergen concentrations, but whether they reduce asthma morbidity among 
mouse-sensitized and exposed children and adolescents is unknown.
OBJECTIVE—To determine the effect of an IPM intervention on asthma morbidity among 
mouse-sensitized and exposed children and adolescents with asthma.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—Randomized clinical trial conducted in 
Baltimore, Maryland, and Boston, Massachusetts. Participants were mouse-sensitized and exposed 
children and adolescents (aged 5–17 years) with asthma randomized to receive professionally 
delivered IPM plus pest management education or pest management education alone. Enrollment 
occurred between May 2010 and August 2014; the final follow-up visit occurred on September 25, 
2015.
INTERVENTIONS—Integrated pest management consisted of application of rodenticide, sealing 
of holes that could serve as entry points for mice, trap placement, targeted cleaning, allergen-proof 
mattress and pillow encasements, and portable air purifiers. Infestation was assessed every 3 
months, and if infestation persisted or recurred, additional treatments were delivered. All 
participants received pest management education, which consisted of written material and 
demonstration of the materials needed to set traps and seal holes.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—The primary outcome was maximal symptom days 
defined as the highest number of days of symptoms in the previous 2 weeks among 3 types of 
symptoms (days of slowed activity due to asthma; number of nights of waking with asthma 
symptoms; and days of coughing, wheezing, or chest tightness) across 6, 9, and 12 months.
RESULTS—Of 361 children and adolescents who were randomized (mean [SD] age, 9.8 [3.2] 
years; 38% female; 181 in IPM plus pest management education group and 180 in pest 
management education alone group), 334 were included in the primary analysis. For the primary 
outcome, there was no statistically significant between-group difference for maximal symptom 
days across 6, 9, and 12 months with a median of 2.0 (interquartile range, 0.7–4.7) maximal 
symptom days in the IPM plus pest management education group and 2.7 (interquartile range, 1.3–
5.0) maximal symptom days in the pest management education alone group (P = .16) and a ratio of 
symptom frequencies of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.69–1.06).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Among mouse-sensitized and exposed children and 
adolescents with asthma, an intensive year-long integrated pest management intervention plus pest 
management education vs pest management education alone resulted in no significant difference 
in maximal symptom days from 6 to 12 months.

 TRIAL REGISTRATION—clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01251224
Mouse infestation is endemic in many low-income, urban neighborhoods in the United 
States.1–3 Previous studies found that mouse-sensitized children and adolescents with 
asthma who are exposed to mouse allergen have greater asthma morbidity than similar 
children and adolescents who either are not sensitized or not exposed to mouse allergen,4–6 
but it is unclear if reducing mouse allergen exposure results in a reduction in asthma 
morbidity among mouse-sensitized children and adolescents.4, 7
The Mouse Allergen and Asthma Intervention Trial (MAAIT) was designed to test the 
hypothesis that an intensive, professionally delivered, integrated pest management (IPM) 
home intervention that included education about pest management would result in 
improvements in asthma symptoms compared with pest management educational one among 
mouse-sensitized and exposed children and adolescents with persistent asthma.
Methods
Study Participants
Individuals were recruited from emergency departments, primary care and subspecialty 
clinics, and databases of previous study participants who had given permission to be 
contacted. Children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 years living in the Boston, Massachusetts, 
or Baltimore, Maryland, metropolitan areas with persistent asthma and an exacerbation in 
the previous year were eligible for the clinic screening visit. Children and adolescents with 
mouse sensitization, which was defined as either a positive skin test to mouse epithelial 
extract (defined as an orthogonal wheal diameter ≥3 mm larger than the negative control) or 
a mouse urine-specific IgE of 0.10 kU/L or greater, were eligible for a home visit to assess 
mouse allergen levels.
Allergy skin testing was performed using a multitester device (Multitest II, Lincoln 
Diagnostics) on a panel of 14 common aeroallergens, including mouse epithelium 
(Stallergenes Greer). Participants who were wheezing at the screening visit did not undergo 
skin testing; and for these participants, mouse sensitization was determined by mouse-
specific IgE testing.
Children and adolescents who had a bed dust mouse allergen concentration of 0.4 µg/g or 
greater or a bedroom floor dust mouse allergen concentration of 0.5 µg/g or greater were 
eligible for randomization. Children and adolescents also had to spend at least 4 nights per 
week in the primary home to be eligible.
The trial protocol (appears in Supplement 1) was approved by the institutional review boards 
of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Boston Children’s Hospital, and Columbia 
University School of Public Health and by the data and safety monitoring committee of the 
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Written informed consent was 
obtained from the parent and the head of household if the parent was not also the head of 
household, and assent was obtained from children and adolescents.

 Study Design and Treatment
MAAIT was a 1 year, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial of an intensive, professionally 
delivered IPM intervention. Participants were randomized by the site coordinator in a ratio 
of 1 to 1 (using random block sizes of 4–6) to either IPM plus pest management education or 
pest management education alone (using a web-based application developed by the data 
management and analysis core staff). Randomization was stratified by study site.
Participants were enrolled and randomized between May 2010 and August 2014 (date when 
the prespecified sample size was met), and the last data point was collected on September 
25, 2015. Participants continued to receive their usual care from their regular asthma 
clinician during the study. Pest management education was delivered at a home visit 
approximately 1 month after randomization and included written material about and 
demonstration of setting mouse traps, sealing of holes and cracks that may serve as entry 
points for mice, and housekeeping practices.
The IPM intervention was adapted from previous work8 in collaboration with licensed pest 
management experts and was delivered in treatments, with each treatment consisting of a 2- 
to 2.5-hour primary visit followed by a 1-hour booster visit 1 to 2 weeks later to reset traps 
and complete any work remaining from the primary visit. The first treatment included 
targeted cleaning to remove allergen reservoirs, placement of traps, application of 
rodenticide, sealing of holes and cracks, installation of allergen-proof mattress and pillow 
encasements (CleanBrands LLC), and 2 portable air purifiers (Filtrete Room Air Purifier, 
3M). Further details about the intervention can be found in the eMethods in Supplement 2.
Infestation was assessed every 3 months; however, if infestation was persistent or recurred, 
an additional treatment was delivered. Participants in the IPM plus pest management 
education group could receive as few as 1 or as many as 4 treatments. Participants 
randomized to the pest management education alone group were offered an IPM intervention 
home visit after completing the study. Self-reported socioeconomic and demographic 
information, including race/ethnicity, was collected because low-income, minority children 
are disproportionately affected by asthma.
Outcome Measures
Asthma-related outcomes were assessed at clinic visits at 6 and 12 months and by telephone 
calls at 3 and 9 months. Asthma symptoms, asthma-related health care use, and medication 
use were captured during clinic visits and telephone calls. The primary outcome of maximal 
symptom days was the maximal number of days with symptoms in the 2 weeks prior to the 
visit or telephone call, and was defined as the largest value among the following 3 symptom 
variables: days of slowed activity due to asthma; number of nights of waking with asthma 
symptoms; and days of coughing, wheezing, or chest tightness.9 This outcome variable has 
been used in a previous multicenter randomized clinical trial of an environmental 
intervention among inner-city children with asthma as well as other similar studies.9 
Maximal symptom days across the 6-, 9-, and 12-month time points was chosen a priori as 
the primary outcome because previous studies suggested that mouse allergen levels would 
not substantially decrease for several months after starting the IPM intervention.8

 Secondary outcomes included individual symptoms (cough without a cold, slowed activity 
due to asthma, nocturnal awakening due to asthma, and inability to speak in full sentences 
due to asthma); rescue medication use (days of short-acting β-agonist use over 2 weeks); 
health care use (urgent physician visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations in 
the previous 3 months); assessment of mouse allergen exposure (bedroom floor, bed, and 
airborne mouse allergen levels); biomarkers of mouse allergen exposure (serum mouse-
specific IgE levels collected at baseline and 12 months); and pulmonary function (forced 
expiratory volume in the first second of expiration [FEV1] predicted percentage, ratio of 
FEV1 to percentage of forced vital capacity and bronchodilator reversibility collected at 
baseline, 6 months, and 12 months).
Three other prespecified secondary outcomes of pulmonary inflammation, serum mouse-
specific IgG levels, and kitchen mouse allergen levels are not reported in this article. A total 
of 21 secondary outcomes were measured and 18 are reported herein. Use of a short course 
of oral corticosteroids over 3 months was a post hoc exploratory outcome. A prespecified 
exploratory analysis was performed to understand whether reductions in mouse allergen 
were associated with improvements in asthma symptoms and morbidity. Further details can 
be found in the eMethods in Supplement 2.
Adverse Events
Adverse events were assessed during clinic visits and telephone calls by asking participants 
if they had any problems since the last clinic visit or telephone call. Severity and relatedness 
to study procedures were determined and recorded.
Statistical Analysis
Sample size estimates indicated that 150 participants in each group (total sample size of 
300) would provide approximately 90% power to detect a difference of at least 0.7 days in 
maximal symptom days per 2-week periods across the 6-, 9-, and 12-month time points with 
an α level of .05. This effect size was chosen because a similar effect size was associated 
with an individually tailored, multifaceted environmental intervention in a similar population 
and because it is similar to the effect associated with inhaled corticosteroids.9
To account for a projected 15% dropout rate, a total of 361 participants were enrolled. Five 
participants in the IPM plus pest management education group and 6 participants in the pest 
management education alone group never received the first intervention or education visit, 
respectively, and were replaced according to the protocol.
For the primary outcome, maximal symptom days in the past 2 weeks assessed across 6, 9, 
and 12 months were related to group assignment with generalized estimating equation 
models assuming a log-link function, an exchangeable correlation, and a robust variance 
estimator. Using this model, the exponentiated coefficient associated with the group 
assignment is interpreted as the ratio of frequencies of symptoms. The analysis was 
performed on the prespecified population of all randomized participants who received at 
least 1 intervention or education visit.

 Missing data were evaluated to determine if there were differences between participants who 
were lost to follow-up and the overall study population. Because there was no evidence that 
the missing data significantly modified the study result, missing data were not imputed 
(eMethods in Supplement 2). Secondary symptom-day outcomes and health care use 
outcomes were analyzed similarly, and for dichotomous outcomes (short course of oral 
corticosteroids and bronchodilator reversibility), a binomial link function was used. For 
mouse-specific IgE, a generalized linear model was used. No adjustments for analysis of 
multiple outcomes were made; therefore, the secondary outcomes should be considered 
exploratory.
For the prespecified exploratory analysis of the association of reductions in mouse allergen 
with improvements in asthma symptoms and morbidity, random-effects models were used to 
relate longitudinal changes in mouse allergen levels to health outcomes. Log2 (mouse 
allergen) was used as the predictor so that the models would provide an estimate of the 
within-person effect of each log2-unit decrease or each 50% decrease in mouse allergen. 
Similar to the analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes, a Poisson link was used to 
estimate rate changes for the outcomes except for the dichotomous outcomes for which a 
binomial link function was used. For these random-effects models, data were used from all 
available visits.
Estimates of the expected change in maximal symptom days and other outcomes for 
prespecified reductions of 50%, 75%, and 90% in bedroom floor mouse allergen were 
calculated using the coefficients from the random-effects models (eMethods in Supplement 
2). Descriptive analyses were performed using R version 3.2.1 (R Foundation for Statistical 
Computing) and all other analyses were performed using Stata version 14.0 (StataCorp). A 
2-tailed P value of less than .05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Enrollment and Study Completion
Nine hundred twenty-eight participants were assessed for eligibility and 361 were 
randomized (181 to the IPM plus pest management education group and 180 to the pest 
management education alone group). One hundred sixty-six participants in the IPM plus pest 
management education group (94%) and 168 participants in the pest management education 
alone group (97%) were included in the primary analysis because they completed at least 1 
study visit at 6, 9, or 12 months and therefore contributed outcome data to the primary 
analysis (Figure). A comparison of baseline characteristics of participants excluded from the 
primary analysis with the overall study population appears in eTable 1 in Supplement 2.
Study Population Characteristics
The mean (SD) age of the population was 9.8 (3.2) years and 132 (38%) were female. The 
population was predominantly low-income and minority (79% black and 21% Hispanic), 
had a median maximal symptom days of 3.0 days in the previous 2 weeks, and a median of 2 
acute visits for asthma in the previous year (Table 1). Twenty-three percent of participants in

 the IPM plus pest management education group and 27% in the pest management education 
alone group reported being hospitalized for asthma in the previous year.
The median mouse-specific IgE level was 13 kU/L in the IPM plus pest management 
education group and 10 kU/L in the pest management education alone group. Mouse 
allergen concentrations in home environmental samples were high, with geometric mean 
concentrations for bedroom floor dust of 6.1 µg/g in the IPM plus pest management 
education group and 6.6 µg/g in the pest management education alone group and 1.1 µg/g 
and 1.1 µg/g, respectively, for bed dust (Table 1).
Primary and Secondary Clinical Outcomes
The IPM plus pest management education group had a median of 2.0 (interquartile range 
[IQR], 0.7–4.7) maximal symptom days across 6, 9, and 12 months vs 2.7 (IQR, 1.3–5.0) 
maximal symptom days in the pest management education alone group (P = .16). The ratio 
of symptom frequencies between the 2 groups was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.69–1.06) (Table 2 and 
eFigure in Supplement 2).
There were no statistically significant differences in secondary outcomes, including mouse-
specific IgE, with a median of 6.0 kU/L (IQR, 1.0 to 22.0 kU/L) in the IPM plus pest 
management education group and 9.0 kU/L (IQR, 1.0 to 26.0 kU/L) in the pest management 
education alone group (β coefficient, −0.29; 95% CI, −1.04 to 0.46). There were a total of 4 
probable or definitely related adverse events in the IPM plus pest management education 
group and 2 in the pest management education alone group, all of which were associated 
with data collection procedures (eTable 2 in Supplement 2).
Intervention and Mouse Allergen
Thirty-two participants (18%) in the IPM plus pest management education group received 1 
IPM treatment, 50 (28%) received 2 treatments, 42 (24%) received 3 treatments, and 52 
(30%) received 4 treatments. At 6 months, 11%of the pest management education alone 
group reported engaging the services of an exterminator and 8% at 12 months. A total of 311 
treatments were indicated due to persistent or recurring mouse infestation, and 290 (93%) 
were delivered.
The geometric mean was 2.0 µg/g for bedroom floor mouse allergen level across all follow-
up visits in the IPM plus pest management education group and 2.5 µg/g in the pest 
management education alone group, which was not statistically different between groups (β 
coefficient, −0.42; 95% CI, −0.91 to 0.07). In prespecified analyses, 63% of participants in 
the IPM plus pest management education group and 58% of participants in the pest 
management education alone group had a reduction of bedroom floor mouse allergen of at 
least 75% at some point during the study (P = .45) and 46% and 41%, respectively, had a 
reduction of at least 90% during some point of the study (P = .44; Table 3).
In a post hoc analysis, 47% in the IPM plus pest management education group and 40% in 
the pest management education alone group had a reduction below a threshold previously 
associated with morbidity (0.5 µg/g in bedroom floor dust).5 The geometric mean airborne 
mouse allergen levels across all follow-up visits were 2.19 pg/m3 in the IPM plus pest

 management education group and 4.68pg/m3 in the pest management education alone group, 
which was statistically significantly different between groups (β coefficient, −1.08; 95% CI, 
−1.51 to −0.65). Similar results were found for bed dust mouse allergen.
However, there were no statistically significant differences for either airborne or bed dust 
mouse allergen in the percentage of participants with reductions of at least 75% or 90% in 
allergen levels. The geometric mean bed cockroach allergen level was 0.004 µg/g at baseline 
and 0.002 µg/g at 12 months in the IPM plus pest management education group (P = .13) 
and 0.003 µg/g and 0.002 µg/g, respectively, in the pest management education alone group 
(P = .24). There was no evidence of change in the performance of the mouse allergen assay 
over time.
Effects of Mouse Allergen Reduction on Asthma
Prespecified exploratory analyses examining the effect of reducing mouse allergen levels on 
asthma-related outcomes were performed across the entire study population (eTable 3 in 
Supplement 2). Each log2 decrease, or 50% decrease, in bedroom floor mouse allergen 
levels was associated with statistically significant reductions in the frequencies of asthma 
symptoms and short-acting β-agonist use, acute visits, and ED visits for asthma. For 
example, every 50% reduction in mouse allergen was associated with a 4% decrease in days 
of short-acting β-agonist use in the previous 2 weeks (ratio of frequencies, 0.96 [95% CI, 
0.95–0.98]; P < .001).
There was no statistically significant association between reduction in bedroom floor mouse 
allergen and hospitalizations, short course of oral corticosteroids, or lung function. 
Reductions in bedroom floor mouse allergen were associated with reductions in mouse-
specific IgE levels. The effects of reducing bed dust and airborne mouse allergen levels on 
asthma-related outcomes and mouse-specific IgE levels were similar (eTables 4 and 5 in 
Supplement 2).
The with in-person effects of a 50%, 75%, and 90% reduction in bedroom floor mouse 
allergen on asthma outcomes were estimated, and the magnitude of the clinical benefit 
increased with greater reduction in mouse allergen (eTable 6 in Supplement 2).For example, 
an individual experiencing a 90% reduction in bedroom floor mouse allergen levels was 
estimated to have 14.1 fewer maximal symptom days (P < .001), 16.4 fewer days of short-
acting β-agonist use (P < .001), 16.7 fewer days of exercise-related symptoms (P < .001), 
and 0.8 less acute visits (P < .001) per year compared with baseline.
Discussion
A year-long, professionally delivered IPM plus education intervention targeting mouse 
allergen was no more effective than pest management education alone in reducing asthma 
symptoms among mouse-sensitized and exposed children and adolescents with persistent 
asthma. Similarly, there were no statistically significant differences between the IPM plus 
pest management education group and the pest management education alone group in any of 
the secondary asthma outcomes, including short-acting β-agonist use, health care use, and 
lung function. In addition, there were no statistically significant between-group differences

 in bedroom floor mouse allergen levels or serum mouse-specific IgE levels, which is a 
biomarker of exposure. Although there were some statistically significant between-group 
differences in bed and airborne mouse allergen, the differences were small and there was no 
statistically significant between-group difference in the proportion of participants with large 
decreases in any measure of mouse allergen.
It is possible that the IPM intervention was not superior to pest management education alone 
in reducing asthma symptoms and other markers of asthma morbidity because it was not 
associated with substantially larger decreases in home mouse allergen levels. The pest 
management education alone group had decreases in home mouse allergen levels of 
approximately 65%, which is larger than that observed in previous home intervention studies 
among the active intervention group,4, 7 and approximately 40% hadatleasta90% decrease in 
mouse allergen levels. This degree of reduction does not appear to be explained by changes 
in allergen assay performance over time. In the mouse allergen intervention subgroup in the 
Inner-city Asthma Study,4 education and research staff were provided to facilitate the 
family’s IPM activities, which resulted in a 27% reduction in bedroom floor mouse allergen 
concentrations, and no reduction in bed mouse allergen concentrations.
DiMango et al7 conducted a home environmental intervention that was delivered by 
intervention counselors, but not pest management professionals, and included IPM targeting 
mouse infestation and observed 30% and 50% reductions in home mouse allergen 
concentrations in the control and active treatment groups, respectively, which are modest 
reductions that may not be sufficient to achieve a clinical benefit.11 The interventions in both 
of these previous studies aimed to reduce home environmental exposures generally, whereas 
in MAAIT, the interventions aimed to reduce mouse allergen specifically.
Therefore, the MAAIT population may have been primed for behavior change related to 
reducing mouse infestation, and thus more responsive to education about pest management 
than participants in these other studies. It is also possible that certain aspects of the pest 
management education, such as delivery of the education at a home visit, contributed to the 
better than expected effects on mouse allergen levels in the pest management education 
alone group.
Mouse allergen concentrations were unlikely to have decreased because of regression to the 
mean because a prior study that also enrolled participants based on home mouse exposure 
did not observe reductions in mouse allergen in the control group, suggesting that mouse 
allergen exposure is generally stable over time, even when used as a study inclusion 
criterion.8 A crossover effect might explain the large reduction in mouse allergen in the pest 
management education alone group; however, only a few participants in this group reported 
engaging professional pest management services.
Although the large reduction in allergen in the pest management education alone group 
provides some evidence that education alone may be effective in reducing mouse allergen 
levels, a randomized clinical trial comparing pest management education with no 
intervention would be the optimal study design to determine the efficacy of education alone. 
However, it may be difficult to design a clinical trial that adequately addresses the ethical

 concerns related to randomizing children who are exposed to a potentially harmful allergen 
to a group that receives no education about reducing exposure to the allergen.12
There are several limitations to consider in addition to the unexpectedly large reductions in 
mouse allergen and the lack of a comparison group that received no pest management 
education. The study was not blinded so it is possible that outcome data were biased by 
knowledge of group assignment by the participant, family, or the study team. However, 
environmental interventions are difficult to blind, and the findings with respect to outcomes 
that are less subject to bias, such as lung function, mouse allergen levels, and mouse-specific 
IgE levels, were consistent with self-reported outcomes.
As with all clinical trials, the MAAIT population is not likely representative of the overall 
population of US children and adolescents with similar asthma, allergic sensitization, and 
exposure characteristics.13–15 Even in the setting of an intensive yearlong IPM intervention, 
mouse allergen concentrations in the majority of homes never fell below a level previously 
associated with increased risk of morbidity,5 so many of the children and adolescents who 
experienced some reduction in mouse allergen and clinical benefit continued to have 
exposure to potentially harmful concentrations of mouse allergen. Another potential 
limitation is that medical management for asthma was not a component of the study 
protocol; therefore, the results of the study are applicable to a population receiving only 
typical care in a community setting.
Prespecified exploratory analyses showed that both groups experienced substantial 
reductions in home mouse allergen of a magnitude not observed in other studies,4, 7 which 
were associated with marked improvement in asthma symptoms and morbidity. Individuals 
who experienced a 90% reduction in home mouse allergen levels had improvements in 
asthma that were larger in magnitude than those observed with inhaled corticosteroids. 
Although inhaled corticosteroid effects have not been estimated for a population similar to 
the one enrolled in MAAIT, in the Childhood Asthma Management Program, which enrolled 
children with mild to moderate asthma, budesonide was associated with 0.1 fewer urgent 
care visits and 0.02 fewer hospitalizations per person-year.16
In the MAAIT population, a 90% reduction in mouse allergen was estimated to result in 0.8 
fewer acute care visits and 0.07 fewer hospitalizations per person-year. Although the 
differences in clinical benefit between the 2 studies may be entirely explained by the 
differences between the study populations, this observation supports the conduct of studies 
to understand how the effect of mouse allergen reduction compares with that of asthma 
controller medication.
Conclusions
Among mouse-sensitized and exposed children and adolescents with asthma, an intensive 
year-long integrated pest management intervention plus pest management education vs pest 
management education alone resulted in no significant difference in maximal symptom days 
from 6 to 12 months.

 Key Points
Question
Does a professionally delivered intervention plus education aimed at mouse infestation 
reduce asthma symptoms among mouse-sensitized children and adolescents with 
persistent asthma compared with education alone?
Findings
In this randomized clinical trial, the median number of maximal symptom days, defined 
as the highest number of days of symptoms among 3 types of symptoms (days of slowed 
activity due to asthma; number of nights of waking with asthma symptoms; and days of 
coughing, wheezing, or chest tightness), within a 2-week period across 6, 9, and 12 
months was 2.0 days with an intensive integrated pest management intervention and 2.7 
days with education alone, with no statistically significant difference between groups.
Meaning
A year-long intensive integrated pest management intervention was no more effective 
than education in improving symptoms among mouse-sensitized children and adolescents 
with asthma.
