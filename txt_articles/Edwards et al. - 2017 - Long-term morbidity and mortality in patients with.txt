uch of the risk of recurrent stroke accrues early after the 
index event,1–3 with population-based estimates rang-
ing from 3.2% to 18.5% at 90 days after stroke4 and 0.6% 
to 16.8% at 90 days after transient ischemic attack (TIA).5 The 
short-term risk of myocardial infarction is lower, ranging from 
0.5% to 4.7% at 1 year, with a cumulative absolute risk of about 
2% per year.6 Because of these high rates of early recurrence, the 
90-day period after stroke or TIA has been a major focus of sec-
ondary prevention in both research and clinical practice.7–9
In addition to high short-term risks, population-based 
studies have shown that the risk of recurrent vascular events 
and death after stroke and TIA can remain elevated over the 
long term, with 5- and 10-year estimates approximating 18% 
and 44%, respectively.10–14 However, in most of these studies, 
risk estimates have included those with adverse outcomes in 
the early high-risk period, and few data have been available to 
characterize long-term risk in survivors who had no early com-
plications after stroke or TIA. The purpose of this study was to 
determine the long-term risks of morbidity and mortality 
among survivors of ischemic stroke or TIA who did not experi-
ence any adverse complications in the first 90 days after dis-
charge, relative to matched controls.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Secondary prevention 
after stroke and transient ischemic 
attack (TIA) has focused on high early risk 
of recurrence, but survivors of stroke can 
have substantial long-term morbidity 
and mortality. We quantified long-term 
morbidity and mortality for patients who 
had no early complications after stroke 
or TIA and community-based controls. 
METHODS: This longitudinal case–
control study included all ambulatory or 
hospitalized patients with stroke or TIA 
(discharged from regional stroke cen-
tres in Ontario from 2003 to 2013) who 
survived for 90 days without recurrent 
stroke, myocardial infarction, all-cause 
admission to hospital, admission to an 
institution or death. Cases and controls 
were matched on age, sex and geo-
graphic location. The primary compos-
ite outcome was death, stroke, myocar-
dial infarction, or admission to 
long-term or continuing care. We calcu-
lated 1-, 3- and 5-year rates of compos-
ite and individual outcomes and used 
cause-specific Cox regression to esti-
mate long-term hazards for cases versus 
controls and for patients with stroke 
versus those with TIA.
RESULTS: Among patients who were 
in 
itially stable after stroke or TIA (n = 
26 366), the hazard of the primary out-
come was more than double at 1 year 
(hazard ratio [HR] 2.4, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 2.3–2.5), 3 years (HR 2.2, 
95% CI 2.1–2.3) and 5 years (HR 2.1, 
95% CI 2.1–2.2). Hazard was highest for 
recurrent stroke at 1 year (HR 6.8, 95% CI 
6.1–7.5), continuing to 5 years (HR 5.1, 
95% CI 4.8–5.5), and for admission to an 
institution (HR 2.1, 95% CI 1.9–2.2). Sur-
vivors of stroke had higher mortality and 
morbidity, but 31.5% (1789/5677) of 
patients with TIA experienced an 
adverse event within 5 years. 
INTERPRETATION: Patients who survive 
stroke or TIA without early complications 
are typically discharged from secondary 
stroke prevention services. However, 
these patients remain at substantial 
long-term risk, particularly for recurrent 
stroke and admission to an institution. 
Novel approaches to prevention, poten-
tially embedded in community or pri-
mary care, are required for long-term 
management of these initially stable but 
high-risk patients.

Methods
We used administrative health data from the province of Ontario, 
Canada, to perform a longitudinal, retrospective matched case–
control registry study. 
Data sources
We obtained Ontario Stroke Registry data from the Institute 
for Clinical Evaluative Sciences. The Ontario Stroke Registry, 
authorized under provincial privacy legislation to perform 
data collection without individual patient consent, used 
active ascertainment methods to capture all consecutive 
patients with acute stroke or TIA presenting to the emer-
gency department or admitted to hospital in 12 regional 
stroke centres in Ontario. Data entry was completed by 
trained abstractors, and reliability testing showed excellent 
agreement (100%) for key variables.15 We linked the Ontario 
Stroke Registry with provincial databases using unique 
encoded patient identifiers to obtain longitudinal data for 
the identification of matched controls and assessment of 
study outcomes.
We used the Canadian Institute for Health Information Dis-
charge Abstract Database, which maintains a high level of 
consistency for the selection and coding of the most respon-
sible diagnosis,16 to document emergency department visits 
and hospital admissions for all study outcomes, according to 
the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and 
Related Health Problems, 10th revision (Appendix 1, available at 
www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.161142/-/DC1). 
We obtained matched controls and data on out-of-hospital 
deaths from the Ontario Registered Persons Database. We 
used the Continuing Care Reporting System, which uses an 
internationally validated assessment instrument as its clini-
cal data standard,17 to capture admissions to long-term and 
continuing care as a proxy of functional status or disability 
after stroke or TIA.
Cases
All consecutive patients with ischemic stroke or TIA seen in 
the emergency department or discharged from hospital at 
regional stroke centres in the province of Ontario from July 1, 
2003, to Mar. 31, 2013, were identified from the Ontario Stroke 
Registry. To identify a cohort of initially stable patients, we 
then restricted the cases to patients who did not experience 
any of the following within 90 days after discharge: death; 
admission to hospital for stroke, TIA, myocardial infarction or 
any other cause; or admission to a long-term or complex con-
tinuing care facility.
Matched controls
Controls were identified from the general Ontario population 
for the period 2003 to 2013 and were matched to cases, at a 
10:1 ratio, on key confounding demographic health indicators, 
including age (± 1 yr), sex, income quintile and area of resi-
dence. To ensure a similar length and period of follow-up, we 
also matched the cases and controls on the date of the case 
entry event (± 50 d), and we followed selected controls for 1, 3 
and 5 years from 90 days after the case discharge date to the 
occurrence of an outcome event or censoring at the end of 
each follow-up period. To ensure a representative primary 
prevention control population, we included those with at 
least one medical contact during the study period: any emer-
gency department visit or hospital admission; an Ontario 
Health Insurance Plan claim for a physician visit or diagnostic 
test; or an Ontario Drug Benefit prescription claim, including 
those with a history of vascular comorbidities. However, as 
part of the causal pathway, these comorbidities were not 
included as matching variables.18 Those with a death date 
before the case index event date (n = 317 362) or any adverse 
complication within the first 90 days of the case’s index event 
date (n = 235 036) were excluded and not considered eligible 
for matching.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was a composite measure of mortality 
and morbidity, encompassing death, hospital admission for 
recurrent stroke or myocardial infarction, or admission to a 
long-term or continuing care facility. Cases were compared 
with controls on the primary outcome at 1, 3 and 5 years from 
the end of the 90 days after the discharge date for the entry 
event. Secondary outcomes were individual measures from the 
composite outcome.
Statistical analyses
We used descriptive statistics to characterize cases with 
respect to demographic and clinical variables, as well as medi-
cations and interventions (endarterectomy and stenting for 
stroke prevention), for stroke and TIA combined and sep-
arately. Standardized differences in means or proportions 
were used to compare case–control pairs on matching vari-
ables, with significance defined as an absolute value greater 
than 0.20 (small effect size).
We determined the proportions of cases and controls that 
experienced the composite and secondary outcomes within 1, 3 
or 5 years of discharge after stroke or TIA. We used χ2 testing to 
compare proportions between cases and matched controls and 
to compare within the stroke versus TIA patient subgroups.
We generated cause-specific Cox proportional hazards 
models to estimate 1-, 3- and 5-year hazards for both compos-
ite and secondary outcomes. Outcome ascertainment was con-
ducted independently within each follow-up period, such that 
events occurring in the first year after 90 days postdischarge 
were not included in 3- or 5-year estimates, and those occur-
ring from the 1-year censoring date to 3 years after 90 days 
postdischarge were not included in the 5-year estimates. All 
models were adjusted for death as a competing risk and used 
robust standard error methods to account for clustering in 
matched pairs.
Ethics approval
This study was approved by the Research Ethics Board of Sunny-
brook Health Sciences Centre.

Results
A total of 38 241 patients were discharged after ischemic stroke 
or TIA from hospital or emergency departments at regional 
stroke centres from July 1, 2003, to Mar. 31, 2013. Of these, 
11 681 (30.5%) experienced an adverse complication within 
90 days of discharge and were excluded from the study cohort, 
which left 26 560 patients eligible for matching. A total of 
16 607 857 controls considered eligible for matching were identi-
fied from the Ontario Registered Persons Database. Applying a 
10:1 matching ratio, we successfully matched 99.3% of the cases, 
to yield a total of 26 366 cases and 263 660 matched controls

(Table 1 and Table 2). For the majority of cases, stroke was the 
entry event (n = 15 950 [60.5%]), with admission to the registry 
hospital. There was a high burden of cardiovascular comorbidity 
among the cases, with high prevalence of hypertension (n = 
19 521 [74.0%]), prior stroke (n = 3715 [14.1%]) and diabetes mel-
litus (n = 7741 [29.4%]). 
The proportion of patients with 90-day event-free survival 
after stroke or TIA who subsequently experienced an adverse 
event in the primary composite outcome (death, hospital 
admission for recurrent stroke or myocardial infarction, or 
admission to long-term or continuing care) was 9.5% (95% con-
fidence interval [CI] 9.4%–9.6%) at 1 year, 23.6% (95% CI 
23.5%–23.7%) at 3 years and 35.7% (95% CI 35.6%–35.8%) at 
5 years. For all outcomes, the rate of adverse events at 1, 3 and 
5 years was significantly higher among patients with stroke or 
TIA than among matched controls (Table 3). 
There was a doubling of the hazard of the primary outcome 
(death, hospital admission for stroke or myocardial infarction, or 
admission to a long-term or continuing care facility) for cases 
rela 
tive to matched controls at 1 year, both for all patients (haz-
ard ratio [HR] 2.4, 95% CI 2.3–2.5) and for stroke and TIA sub-
groups separately (Table 4). This risk remained consistent at 
3 years (HR 2.2, 95% CI 2.1–2.3) and 5 years (HR 2.1, 95% CI 2.1–
2.2) after the index stroke or TIA. Across all time points, the high-
est long-term risks were for recurrent stroke at 1 year (HR 6.8, 
95% CI 6.1–7.5), 3 years (HR 5.6, 95% CI 5.2–6.0) and 5 years 
(HR 5.1, 95% CI 4.8–5.5), with an 8-fold increase in recurrent 
stroke hazard at 1 year when only patients with an index stroke 
were considered (HR 8.2, 95% CI 7.3–9.3) (Table 4). The risk of 
admission to an institution was also increased more than 2-fold 
for 5 years. The risks of myocardial infarction and death were 
lower but also remained constant for 5 years (Table 4).
Interpretation
Using a whole-population approach, we quantified the hazard 
of death, recurrent stroke or myocardial infarction, or admis-
sion to a care facility among stroke survivors who experienced 
no complications in the early high-risk period after stroke or 
TIA. Even for those who were clinically stable after 90 days, the 
hazard of experiencing an adverse outcome after stroke or TIA 
was more than double at 1, 3 and 5 years of follow-up, com-
pared with matched controls. Notably, long-term risks were 
highest for recurrent stroke and admission to an institution, 
whereas myocardial infarction did not present a substantial 
long-term risk. Furthermore, even among those who presented 
with TIA and who were clinically stable after the early high-risk 
period, a high proportion experienced long-term adverse 
events within 1, 3 and 5 years after discharge. These analyses 
indicate that survival after both stroke and TIA is a marker of 
major long-term risk, which merits aggressive attention to risk 
reduction strategies.
Only one small study (n = 290) previously examined long-
term outcomes in clinically stable patients.14 That study was 
conducted over the period 1981–1986, before the modern 
era of organized stroke care and secondary prevention, and 
was restricted to patients with TIA as an entry event, who 
were stroke-free after a median of 3.8 years.14 Consistent 
with that earlier study, we found high long-term hazards of 
adverse outcomes among patients with stroke or TIA at 
entry; however, the present study also showed that this haz-
ard was not driven purely by early events, but remained sig-
nificantly elevated for up to 5 years, even among those free 
of early complications after stroke or TIA. These findings 
indicate that both stroke and TIA are sentinel events that 
confer persistent long-term risks of major adverse outcomes 
and suggest the need for secondary prevention approaches 
that not only focus on the management of high short-term 
risks, but also include strategies for long-term outpatient 
risk reduction, even when no early adverse complications 
have occurred.
Consistent with the fact that most individuals who experi-
ence a stroke are older, the most common secondary out-
come observed in the present study was death, with 26% of 
patients dying over the 5-year follow-up period. However, the 
highest cause-specific hazard for these initially stable patients 
was for recurrent stroke, at almost 7 times that of matched 
controls within the first year after stroke or TIA, and remaining 
5 times greater for up to 5 years. Recurrent stroke was thus 
the most important potentially modifiable outcome after 
stroke or TIA, even if recurrence occurred after the early high-
risk period.
These findings highlight the need for long-term manage-
ment of key modifiable risks for clinically stable survivors of 
stroke or TIA, including control of hypertension,20 detection 
and treatment of atrial fibrillation,21 smoking cessation and 
physical activity.22 Although recent evidence has shown a trend 
toward improvement in these outcomes since 2003, suggesting 
improved control of cardiovascular risks over this period,23 our

findings indicate that in the overall stroke population, the 
prevalence of modifiable risks remains high.9,24,25 Long-term 
aggressive risk factor reduction might be accomplished by 
leveraging existing resources and community-based programs 
for exercise and risk factor control, such as cardiac rehabilita-
tion, but tailoring them to stroke populations and following 
this model for the longer term (i.e., years rather than months 
after the index event). In addition, recent efforts have focused 
on identifying alternative risk markers (e.g., depression, 
obstructive sleep apnea, cognitive impairment) that may go 
undetected after a stroke or TIA and that may confer additional 
risk for recurrence, beyond the traditional modifiable vascular 
risk factors.26
The hazard of admission to an institution was also 
increased almost 3-fold at 1 year, but declined to rates similar 
to myocardial infarction and death by 5 years after stroke or 
TIA. Although admission to an institution is a multifactorial 
and potentially less easily modifiable outcome, stroke and TIA 
have been recognized as major causes of institutionalization 
after acute care.27 Recurrent strokes are typically more severe 
than index events28 and have been shown to independently 
predict both disability and admission to an institution, and 
also to increase the risk of cognitive decline and dementia.29 It 
is thus not surprising that, given the high observed hazard of 
recurrent stroke, the hazard of institutionalization was also 
high. These findings have important implications for the provi-
sion of rehabilitative and supportive services after stroke or 
TIA, even for those who initially appear clinically stable, and 
suggest that outpatient programs resourced to support sus-
tained, long-term functional improvements are required to

*For all comparisons (using  χ2 tests to compare cases and matched controls and to compare stroke and TIA subgroups), p < 0.001, except for 
the comparison of stroke versus TIA subgroups for MI outcomes, where p > 0.05 at all follow-up time points.
†The percentages for longitudinal analyses are based on the denominator of subcohorts with complete 1-, 3- or 5-year follow-up. The 
denominator at 1 year was the same as the full cohort: 26 366 total (15 950 with stroke and 10 416 with TIA). At 3 years, the subcohort 
denominator was 21 548 total (13 287 with stroke and 8261 with TIA), and at 5 years the subcohort denominator was 15 571 total (9894 with 
stroke and 5677 with TIA). All matched control cohorts were matched 10:1 with cases, so the denominator for the matched control cohort was 
10 times the total denominator for each year: 263 660 at 1 year, 215 480 at 3 years and 155 710 at 5 years.

reduce morbidity and admission to an institution after stroke 
or TIA.30
Although rates of adverse outcomes were significantly 
higher among patients with stroke than among those with TIA, 
subgroup analyses indicated that hazard ratios for the pri-
mary outcome and the majority of secondary outcomes in 
patients with TIA were also quite high. Specifically, almost 
one-third of patients with TIA experienced a primary outcome 
event within 5 years, with a 4-fold increase in the hazard of 
recurrent stroke relative to controls for up to 5 years, which 
shows that even patients with transient presentations who 
have no early complications remain at increased risk of 
adverse outcomes over the long term. This finding is consis-
tent with prior studies showing that 2-year stroke recurrence 
was similar among patients with minor compared with moder-
ate or severe stroke or TIA31 and that patients with TIA and 
minor stroke had high cumulative long-term risks of both non-
fatal and fatal myocardial infarction,32 confirming that long-
term vascular risk can remain elevated, even for those with 
minor presenting events.
These high long-term risks were observed in the context 
of a universally funded and accessible health care system, 
with organized stroke services spanning the continuum of 
care. Canadian best practice recommendations for stroke 
have a strong focus on risk factor management for second-
ary stroke prevention,33 and the deployment of organized 
stroke services has resulted in significant improvements in 
both hospital and short-term outcomes,34,35 yet one gap that 
remains in organized outpatient care relates to long-term 
follow-up. Many secondary prevention clinics follow patients 
primarily during the highest-risk early phase (90 d after 
stroke or TIA), with the closest follow-up occurring for those 
with early adverse complications. Given the high total hospi-
talization costs associated with recurrent events,36 new 
models of secondary prevention may be required to bridge 
this gap in long-term care. Multifaceted programs for the use 
of evidence-based stroke prevention guidelines in the pri-
mary care setting are cost-effective and result in improved 
early treatment and preventive advice for individuals with 
TIA.37,38 There is also emerging evidence that primary care 
and community-based pharmacy interventions are effective 
in reducing the risk of cardiovascular outcomes.39,40 Thus, 
novel approaches to stroke prevention, potentially embed-
ded in community or primary care, may be an effective alter-
native to specialty follow-up for long-term management in 
this high-risk population.
Strengths and limitations
An important strength of the present study was the use of a 
global population approach to identify a cohort of clinically 
stable patients with stroke and TIA most representative of 
patients who would be seen and discharged from specialist 
outpatient clinics. However, this study also had limitations. 
Information on stroke etiology was not available from the 
regi 
stry data. We were thus unable to identify potential dif-
ferences in long-term risk associated with different mech-
anisms of the entry event. Given previously reported esti-
mates for the sensitivity (80%) and specificity (85%–90%) of 
stroke diagnoses,41 the present study was subject to poten-
tial biases due to misclassification or missing cases in the 
determination of stroke, as the entry event or the outcome 
event (or both).

Conclusion
Clinically stable patients, without any adverse complications 
in the first 90 days after stroke or TIA, had significantly ele-
vated long-term hazards of death, stroke, myocardial infarc-
tion and admission to an institution, relative to matched con-
trols, for at least 5 years. For survivors of stroke or TIA, the 
long-term risk of recurrent stroke was particularly high, indi-
cating that stroke recurrence is the most important modifi-
able outcome and that aggressive long-term secondary pre-
vention is warranted for risk reduction, even among survivors 
with no early complications. However, because most second-
ary stroke prevention clinics focus on the highest-risk early 
phase, novel system approaches to long-term management, 
embedded in community or primary care, may be required to 
address long-term risk for initially stable survivors of stroke 
and TIA.
