IMPORTANCE An increased understanding of the relationship between subconcussive head
impacts and near point of convergence (NPC) ocular-motor function may be useful in
delineating traumatic brain injury.
OBJECTIVE To investigate whether repetitive subconcussive head impacts during preseason
football practice cause changes in NPC.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective, observational study of 29 National
Collegiate Athletic Association Division I football players included baseline and preseason
practices (1 noncontact and 4 contact), and postseason follow-up and outcome measures
were obtained for each time. An accelerometer-embedded mouthguard measured head
impact kinematics. Based on the sum of head impacts from all 5 practices, players were
categorized into lower (n = 7) or higher (n = 22) impact groups.
EXPOSURES Players participated in regular practices, and all head impacts greater than
10g from the 5 practices were recorded using the i1Biometerics Vector mouthguard
(i1 Biometrics Inc).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Near point of convergence measures and symptom scores.
RESULTS A total of 1193 head impacts were recorded from 5 training camp practices in the 29
collegiate football players; 22 were categorized into the higher-impact group and 7 into the
lower-impact group. There were significant differences in head impact kinematics between
lower- and higher-impact groups (number of impacts, 6 vs 41 [lower impact minus higher
impact = 35; 95% CI, 21-51; P < .001]; linear acceleration, 99g vs 1112g [lower impact minus
higher impact= 1013; 95% CI, 621 –1578; P < .001]; angular acceleration, 7589 radian/s2 vs
65 016 radian/s2 [lower impact minus higher impact= 57 427; 95% CI , 31 123-80 498;
P < .001], respectively). The trajectory and cumulative burden of subconcussive impacts on
NPC differed by group (F for group × linear trend1, 238 = 12.14, P < .001 and F for group ×
quadratic trend1, 238 = 12.97, P < .001). In the higher-impact group, there was a linear increase
in NPC over time (B for linear trend, unstandardized coefficient [SE]: 0.76 [0.12], P < .001)
that plateaued and resolved by postseason follow-up (B for quadratic trend [SE]: −0.06
[0.008], P < .001). In the lower-impact group, there was no change in NPC over time. Group
differences were first observed after the first contact practice and remained until the final
full-gear practice. No group differences were observed postseason follow-up. There were no
differences in symptom scores between groups over time.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although asymptomatic, these data suggest that repetitive
subconcussive head impacts were associated with changes in NPC. The increase in NPC
highlights the vulnerability and slow recovery of the ocular-motor system following
subconcussive head impacts. Changes in NPC may become a useful clinical tool in deciphering
brain injury severity.

S
ubconcussion can be defined as a low-magnitude head
impact that does not elicit clinical signs of concussion
but potentially causes significant long-term neurologi-
cal defects.1-3 Given the concern regarding concussion, under-
standingtheeffectsofrepetitivesubconcussiveimpactsiscriti-
calbecausesubconcussiveimpactsoccurmorefrequentlythan
concussions.4-6 American football, especially at the college
level, is the sport associated with the highest incidence of con-
cussion (0.61 per 1000 athlete exposures)7,8; moreover, col-
lege football players are reported to endure from 950 to 1353
subconcussive head impacts per season.4,9-11
While sports-related concussion is often attributed to a
single impact, prior to the concussive blow, athletes in con-
tact sports are frequently exposed to subconcussive head
impacts.12 Establishing a threshold for concussion based on a
single impact may be inconclusive given the variation in con-
cussion-associated head acceleration (29g-205g).5,12 Head im-
pact kinematics in contact sports are investigated using the
Head Impact Telemetry system13,14 and accelerometer-
embedded mouthguards.15,16 However, there are substantial
knowledge gaps in the relationships between subconcussive
impact kinematics and outcome measures.
Theocular-motorsystemorchestratesaccommodationand

als to visualize an object at various distances and directions.17

compared with baseline, with NPC impairment persisting for
24 hours after heading.19 The near point of convergence im-
mediately after and 24 hours after heading were higher than
in control individuals.19 Thus, we hypothesized that repeti-
tive football subconcussive impacts would worsen NPC, par-
ticularly among players with higher magnitude and greater
frequency of impacts compared with lower-impact players.
Methods
Participants
Thirty-three National Collegiate Athletic Association Divi-
sionIfootballplayersatTempleUniversityvolunteeredforthis
study. The study was conducted during a preseason physical
examination on June 9, 2015, a series of full contact and no
contact training camp practices (August 6-21, 2015), and post-
season follow-up. Inclusion criterion was being an active foot-
ball team member. Exclusion criteria included a history of
head, neck, or face injury in the previous 6 months or neuro-
logical or ocular disorders. Four players exhibited abnor-
mally high NPC scores (9.75 cm, 10.5 cm, 11 cm, and 12.5 cm)
atpreseasonbaselinethatwerehigherthantheteammean[SD]
baseline (5.5 [2.0] cm). Because NPC scores higher than
9.5 cm to 10 cm are considered defective or convergence
insufficiency,20,21 these players were excluded from the analy-
sis. Data from participants diagnosed as having an orthope-
dic injury (n = 2) and concussion (n = 1) were excluded from
further analysis. Participants refrained from substances that
could affect their nervous system (eg, stimulants), and alco-
hol use was prohibited. All participants gave written
informed consent, and the Temple University institutional
review board approved the study.
Study Procedures
During preseason physical examination, participants were fit-
ted with the Vector mouthguard (i1 Biometrics Inc) that
measured the number of hits and magnitude of head accelera-
tion.Afterbeingbrieflysubmergedinboilingwater,themouth-
guard was fitted for each player’
s bite for a secure custom
fit. Demographic information (eg, age and years of American
football experience), Sports Concussion Assessment Tool 3
symptomchecklist,andocular-motorfunction(NPC)werecol-
lected. During training camp practices, head impact data were
collected from 5 practices with intervals of 3 to 4 days between
measures,startingfromfirstnoncontact(padsoff),firstfullcon-
tact(padson),and3otherfull-contactpractices(Figure1).Post-
season follow-up measurements were taken 3 weeks after the
final game of season in a subset of participants (n = 18), and no
practices occurred during this 3-week period.
Based on the sum from 5-practice impact kinematic data
collections, players were categorized into lower- and higher-
impact groups for analysis. There were at least 6 impacts, 186g,
9614 radian/s2, and 15 head injury criterion differences be-
tween the highest value of the lower-impact group and the
lowest value of the higher-impact group in the number of hits,
peak linear acceleration, peak angular acceleration, and head
injury criterion, respectively (Table). Symptom checklist and
NPC data were collected 1 to 2 hours before and 1 to 2 hours
after practices.

Key Points
Question Do repetitive subconcussive head impacts from football
alter ocular near point of convergence?
Findings This study of 29 college football players showed that
participants who sustained higher frequencies and magnitudes of
impacts had greater convergence insufficiency compared with
those with fewer and less severe impacts. The impairment in
convergence remained constant throughout the brief study
period; however, after 3 weeks of rest, convergence normalized to
baseline levels.
Meaning The slow nature of the ocular-motor systems recovery
suggests its vulnerability to repetitive subconcussive head
impacts.

posttrigger samples [1024 Hz sampling frequency] with a stan-
dard hit duration of 93.75 milliseconds) data were transmitted
wirelessly and stored on a secure Internet database (Figure 2).
Near Point of Convergence
Near point of convergence was assessed based on our estab-
lished protocol.19,22 Participants were seated with their head
in neutral anatomical position. No spectacles were permit-
ted; participants wore contact lenses if needed. The accom-
modative ruler (Bernell Inc) rested on the participant’
s upper
lip, and an accommodative target (reduced-size Snellen chart)
was adjusted horizontally to participant’
s eye level. The tar-
get was moved down the length of the ruler toward the eyes
at a rate of approximately 1 to 2 cm/s. Near point of conver-
gence was taken when the tester observed eye misalignment
or when participants verbally signaled experiencing diplo-
pia. On verbal signal, the tester stopped moving the target and
recorded the distance between the participant and object. The
assessment was repeated twice, and mean NPC was used for
analyses. One trained tester assessed all players at all time
points, with intrarater reliability resulting in high association
between trials of all time points (r= 0.93, P < .001).
Symptom Checklist
Participants were instructed to rate the presence of any symp-
tom at each time point using the symptom checklist, a subset
of the Sports Concussion Assessment Tool 3.23
Statistical Analysis
Group differences (lower and higher impact) in baseline char-
acteristics were compared using independent-sample t tests
for continuous variables and χ2 tests for categorical variables.
To examine group differences in the effects of subconcussive
impacts, we conducted a series of mixed-effects regression
models (MRMs) on the primary outcomes (NPC and symp-
toms). The MRMs were used to accommodate repeated mea-
surements across 12 times that were correlated with different
degrees. Relative to other analytic approaches (eg, repeated
measuresanalysisofvariance),MRMaccountsformissingdata,
which increases statistical power and preserves the represen-
tativeness of the results to the larger population.24
TwoseparateMRMswereconductedoneachoutcome.The
first MRM focused on group differences in the cumulative bur-
den of subconcussive impacts across the study duration to
determine whether the trajectory/burden differed between
lower- and higher-impact groups. To this end, we conducted
random linear and polynomial trend (quadratic) modeling, a
subclass of MRM that accounts for both individual differ-
ences at baseline and over time (which may not be linear). Vari-
ablesincludedinthemodelweregroup(lowerandhigher),time
(lineartrend),time×time(quadratictrend),andgroupbytrend
interactions. Significant group by trend interactions indicate
that the pattern of change in an outcome measure over time
differs between individuals in the lower- and higher-impact
groups. The second MRM identified the initial time where
groupdifferencesemerged(relativetobaseline),remained,and
declined across the study duration. The focus was on the rate
of change in each outcome from baseline to each time point
(eg, pads-off 1). Variables included in the analysis were group
(low and high) and dummy variables for each time (eg, pads-
off 1 prepractice, pads-off 1 postpractice, pads-on 1 preprac-
tice, pads-on 1 postpractice, etc) and all 2-way interactions
(eg, group × pads-off 1 prepractice, etc). The group × time in-
teractions are the primary interest, and significance indi-
cates that the change in an outcome from baseline to each time
point differs for individuals in the lower- and higher-impact
group. All MRMs were analyzed with SAS, version 9.4 for Win-
dows (SAS Institute Inc) and significance was set at P < .05.

the trajectory and cumulative burden of subconcussive im-
pacts on NPC differed for the lower- and higher-impact groups
(F for group × linear trend1, 238 = 12.14, P < .001 and F for
group × quadratic trend1, 238 = 12.97, P < .001). In the higher-
impact group, there was a significant increase (worsening) in
NPC over time (B, unstandardized coefficient for linear
trend [SE], 0.76 [0.12]; P < .001) that resolved by the post-
season time point (B for quadratic trend [SE], −0.06
[0.008]; P < .001). Conversely, in the lower-impact group,
there was no change in trajectory/cumulative burden of sub-
concussive impacts across the study duration (B for linear
trend [SE], −0.10 [0.22]; P = .64 and B for quadratic trend
[SE], −0.002 [0.01], P = .89).
In the second MRM analysis, we aimed to identify the spe-
cific point where change occurred relative to baseline and to
determine whether changes differed for those in the lower- vs
higher-impactgroups.Overall,changesinNPCrelativetobase-
line were different for those in the lower- vs higher-impact
groups (F11, 274 = 3.66, P < .001) (Figure 3). While the change
in NPC from baseline to pads-off 1 preprepractice through the
pads-on 1 prepractice did not differ by group (P >.06), the
change in NPC from baseline to pads-on 1 postpractice through
the pads-on 4 postpractice did differ by group (P <.01). Spe-
cifically, the higher-impact group demonstrated an increase
(worsening) in NPC from baseline to the pads-on 1 postprac-
tice (B [SE], 2.70 [0.72]; P < .001) and this increase persisted
over the remaining times (P <.01) until the pads-on 4 post-
practice time (B [SE], 2.12 [0.73]; P < .01). The change in NPC
from baseline to postseason follow-up did not statistically dif-
ferbetweenthelower-andhigher-impactgroups(F1, 274 = 1.46,
P = .23) (Figure 3).
Giventhereducednumberofdatapointsatpostseasonfol-
low-up among the higher-impact group, a series of secondary
MRM analyses were conducted on the kinematics variables to
ensure that the return of NPC to baseline levels at postseason
follow-up was not driven by the loss of follow-up data among
players possibly receiving the highest number of impacts
(higher kinematics over time). Importantly, players returning
postseason vs players not returning postseason sustained a
similar frequency and magnitude of subconcussive head im-
pacts across the study duration (P >.38), suggesting that the
normalizedNPCtobaselinelevelsatpostseasonwasnotdriven
by players receiving the highest number and magnitude of
impacts.
Symptoms
In contrast to NPC, the trajectory of symptom scores did
not differ as a function of group F for group × linear
trend1, 267 = 0.87, P = .35 (eFigure in the Supplement). Addi-
tionally, changes in symptom scores from baseline to each
time were similar for all players in the lower- and higher-
impact groups (F11, 274 = 0.34, P = .97).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first prospective, longitudinal co-
hort study of collegiate football players examining the effects
of repetitive subconcussive head impacts on NPC and self-
reported symptoms. The first notable finding was that sub-
concussive head impacts were not associated with notice-
able changes in players’ symptom reports, regardless of
frequency and magnitude of impacts. Second, consistent with
previousstudies,25,26wefoundthatexposuretorepetitivesub-
concussive impacts compromised NPC function, but only
among players in the higher-impact group. Lastly, after a
3-week rest period, postseason NPC was normalized to the pre-
season baseline in the higher-impact group, suggesting that
ocular-motor function has the potential to reflect subclinical
brain damage and its recovery.

While the team mean (SD) baseline NPC (5.5 [2.0] cm) was
consistent with our previous study with healthy young adults
(5.9 [1.6] cm),22 among players in the higher-impact group, ex-
posure to repetitive subconcussive impacts during contact
practices increased NPC scores by approximately 29% to 38%
relative to baseline levels. This is notable, given that a 3-fold
increase in NPC has been demonstrated in both soldiers with
blast-induced mild traumatic brain injury compared with non–
mild traumatic brain injury control individuals25 and among
64 athletes with concussions compared with control
individuals.26,27
When interpreting these findings, it is vital to consider the
data collection days in relation to the summer camp schedule.

Afterpads-off1,wecollectedthedataonthefirstfull-gearprac-
tice of the camp (pads-on 1). While prepractice NPC score from

Therewere3-to4-dayintervalsbetweeneachpads-ondatacol-
lection. We observed consistently increased NPC scores in the

ing incomplete recovery of the ocular-motor system.
When considering the validity of head injury assessment
tools, it is imperative to rule out the potential contribution of
exercise and/or fatigue in relation to outcomes. The linear in-
crease in NPC scores over time in the high impact group ar-
gues against the alternative hypothesis that fatigue and/or ex-
ercise influenced NPC. If NPC scores were impacted by fatigue
and/or exercise, we would expect to see nonlinear fluctua-
tions in prepractice vs postpractice scores.
Our kinematic data are consistent with several studies
using the Head Impact Telemetry system. Mean numbers of
hits per player per practice were 7.0, 7.6, and 9.4 hits in our
study, Duma et al,14 and Crisco et al,13 respectively. Similarly,
mean peak linear acceleration per hit was 30.3g, 32.0g, and
28.8g in our study, Duma et al,14 and Reynolds et al,28 respec-
tively. Our motivation for using the mouthguard sensor was
to avoid factors that may produce considerable measure-
ment errors in a helmet-based approach such as helmet fit and
padding type.29-31 Kinematic accuracy of the instrumented
mouthguard resulted in an excellent correlation with the
matched data from an anthropomorphic testing device (crash
test dummy).15,32 Moreover, Wu et al33 used a human soccer
headingmodeltotestthekinematicaccuracyamongheadgear-
mounted,mouthguard,andskinpatchsensors,comparedthem
withhigh-speedvideo,andshowedthatmouthguarddisplace-
ments were less than 1 mm, whereas headgear and skin patch
displaced as much as 13 mm and 4 mm from the ear canal ref-
erence points, respectively.
Whilelargerprospectivestudiesareneededtoreplicateour
findings,thisstudydetectedchangesinNPCovertimeasafunc-
tion of group (higher vs lower impact). The 29 players studied
contributed 325 observations for each of the primary analyses.
Moreover, our validated NPC measurement19,22 does not re-
quire administration by an experienced physician but exhibits
an excellent test-retest reliability (r = 0.93, P < .001), suggest-
ing its potential to be used in clinical practice. Future studies
should consider additional time points for assessments, par-
ticularly during mid and late season. Additional time points
might help to determine whether NPC would continue to in-
crease throughout the duration of the season or stabilize be-
fore returning back to baseline levels postseason. Although the
NPC measurement that we used provides a robust implication
toclinical/sidelineusage,theeffectofsubconcussiveimpacton
dynamic convergence parameters, including slower peak ve-
locity, longer latency period, and shorter duration of contrac-
tility, remain speculative.34,35 Traumatcic brain injuary pro-
duces heterogeneous signs and symptoms, and although eye
movement metrics show vulnerability in response to various
formsoftraumaticbraininjury,19,25,26,36asinglemeasureofeye
movement/alignment does not have the sensitivity and speci-
ficitytoaccuratelyassessbraindamage.Therefore,multipleap-
proaches,includingbloodbiomarkers,37neuroimaging,38,39and
vestibular function,40 may be key in delineating concussion/
subconcussion pathophysiology.
Conclusions
There is growing concern that even low-level head impacts
(subconcussive) can cause significant injury if sustained re-
petitively. While behavioral changes in response to subcon-
cussiveheadimpactsaredifficulttomeasure,evidencecoupled
with neuroimaging data suggest that the ocular-motor sys-
tem is particularly vulnerable and sensitive to head
impacts.19,38,39,41 Our data provide evidence of cumulative de-
fect in the ocular NPC, and these changes may be head im-
pactfrequency–andmagnitude-dependent.Aftera3-weekrest
period,NPCnormalizedtothebaseline.Futureprospectiveco-
hort studies to investigate the clinical relevance of these NPC
changes induced by subconcussive impacts compared with
concussion are warranted.
