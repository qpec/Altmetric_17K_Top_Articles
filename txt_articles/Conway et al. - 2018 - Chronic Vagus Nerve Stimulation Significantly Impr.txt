ABSTRACT
Objective: To compare quality-of-life (QOL) change associated 
with treatment as usual (TAU, any antidepressant treatment) versus 
adjunctive vagus nerve stimulation treatment (VNS + TAU) in a 
population of patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) for 
5 years.
Methods: Self-reported QOL assessments, using the Quality of Life 
Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF), 
were gathered in a multicenter, longitudinal registry (January 2006–
May 2015) comparing the antidepressant efficacy of VNS + TAU versus 
TAU in TRD. All depressed patients (N = 599), with either unipolar or 
bipolar depression, met DSM-IV-TR major depressive episode criteria 
and failed at least 4 adequate antidepressant trials. The Montgomery-
Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was administered by blinded 
raters. Q-LES-Q-SF scores in the treatment arms were compared via 
linear regression; linear regression was employed to compare QOL 
differences with percent decrease in MADRS. A subanalysis comparing 
Q-LES-Q-SF functional domain change was performed.
Results: 328 VNS + TAU and 271 TAU patients with TRD were 
compared. On average, VNS + TAU demonstrated a significant, 
comparative QOL advantage over TAU (as demonstrated via non-
overlapping 95% confidence bands) that began at 3 months and was 
sustained through 5 years and was reinforced using a clinical global 
improvement measure. Patients receiving VNS + TAU, but not TAU 
alone, demonstrated a clinically meaningful QOL improvement (34% 
MADRS decrease) well below the classically defined antidepressant 
response (50% MADRS decrease). Exploratory post hoc subanalysis 
demonstrated that VNS + TAU had a significant advantage in multiple 
Q-LES-Q domains.
Conclusion: Compared to TAU, adjunctive VNS significantly improved 
QOL in TRD, and this QOL advantage was sustained. Further, TRD 
patients treated with VNS experienced clinically meaningful QOL 
improvements even with depression symptom reduction less than the 
conventional 50% reduction used to ascribe “response.”

n 2005, the United States Food and Drug Administration 
approved the use of adjunctive vagus nerve stimulation 
(VNS) treatment for treatment-resistant major depression 
(TRD) not responsive to 4 antidepressant treatment trials. 
VNS involves intermittent electrical stimulation of the 
left cervical vagus nerve using an implanted electrical 
stimulator. Since approval, additional studies have further 
demonstrated the efficacy of VNS for TRD.1,2
Recently, Aaronson et al3 published the report of the 
longest and largest treatment trial of VNS use in TRD to 
date. The investigators demonstrated that VNS, combined 
with treatment as usual (ie, any treatment available to 
psychiatrists, including electroconvulsive therapy [ECT]), 
was superior to treatment as usual without VNS, achieving 
greater response (50% reduction in depressive symptoms) 
and remission rates and lowering overall suicide rates. 
During the course of studying VNS in TRD and epilepsy, 
the treatment has also been hypothesized to positively 
affect factors beyond depression, including anxiety and 
alertness,4–7 pain perception,8 and cognition.9,10 The 
effects of VNS on long-term quality of life (QOL) have 
yet to be examined.
Over the past 20 years, there has been emerging 
recognition that measuring antidepressant response based 
solely on standardized depressive symptom scales (eg, 
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale) does not adequately 
assess improvements in QOL or daily functioning seen 
with resolution of clinical depressive syndromes.11 That is, 
effective depression treatment should improve the patient’s 
depressive symptomatology as well as overall QOL and 
functioning across multiple life domains. Research on 
the “minimal clinically important difference” [MCID] 
has attempted to address this very issue by examining 
the smallest degree of change in a clinical outcome 
measure that is clinically meaningful. While there is no 
established MCID for QOL improvement in unipolar 
depression, Endicott et al12 previously determined the 
MCID for a standardized measure of QOL, the Quality 
of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire Short 
Form (Q-LES-Q-SF).13
This report examines the effects of VNS on QOL 
in patients with unipolar and bipolar TRD using 
longitudinally collected data concomitantly with 
depression scale data as part of a 5-year VNS clinical 
registry. On the basis of previous evidence of beneficial 
effects of VNS on anxiety, alertness, cognition, and 
other symptoms often comorbid with depression, we

VNS Improves Quality of Life in Depression
hypothesized that VNS would improve QOL beyond 
standard antidepressant treatments. We also proposed that 
this QOL advantage may be sustained over time during the 5 
years of study observation. We conducted an additional post 
hoc subanalysis to elucidate potentially specific QOL factors 
enhanced with sustained VNS in TRD. Finally, we compared 
the change in QOL via the Q-LES-Q-SF occurring with 
adjunctive VNS using the MCID Endicott et al12 reported 
for a bipolar depression population in our combined bipolar 
and unipolar TRD population.
METHODS
Overview
As part of a large 5-year clinical registry (the overall time 
span for the study was January 2006–May 2015; see Aaronson 
et al3 for details), quality of life data were collected on all 
patients at established intervals using the Q-LES-Q-SF,13 a 
14-item scale that measures improvements across a wide 
range of life areas including physical health, mood, work, 
economic situation, and social relationships. Detailed data 
on baseline demographics and clinical features, including 
duration of illness, number of failed antidepressant trials, 
and number of lifetime depressive episodes, were obtained 
in the registry. The 61 sites were selected based on significant 
experience with TRD and VNS for TRD; the vast majority of 
sites (60 [98%] of 61) contributed both treatment-as-usual 
(TAU) subjects and subjects with TAU plus adjunctive VNS 
(VNS + TAU). Subjects were recruited into the registry 
based on a history of highly refractory TRD (ie, minimal 
failure of 4 more adequate antidepressant trials, diagnosis 
of major depressive episode using DSM-IV-TR,14 and the 
commitment that their symptom and treatment course 
would be followed by experienced staff for 5 years). Because 
this registry followed the natural treatment course of TRD, 
no restrictions were placed on the treatments for the TAU 
group; patients could receive any psychopharmacologic, 
neurostimulation (including ECT), or psychotherapeutic 
intervention for the 5-year duration.
At all participating sites, the registry was approved by an 
institutional review board, and written informed consent 
was obtained from all study patients after the procedures 
had been fully explained. Depression assessments were 
obtained by offsite blinded raters using the Montgomery-
Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).15
Statistical Analyses
A slightly different sample from that reported in the 
Aaronson et al study3 was used for the analysis presented 
in this article (see Supplementary Figure 1 for a CONSORT 
diagram detailing patient selection for the analysis). 
Specifically, patients who rolled over from a previous VNS 
dose-finding study2 were excluded so that both TAU and 
VNS + TAU patients had the same follow-up period; patients 
in the dose-finding study did not have post-baseline Q-LES-
Q-SF assessments until the 18-month visit. Further, patients 
who were not depressed at baseline (MADRS score of < 10) 
were also removed from the analysis. Thus, analyses in this 
report used data from 328 patients treated with VNS + TAU 
and 271 patients treated with TAU. Data from all visits were 
incorporated. For paired data analyses, such as the change 
in Q-LES-Q-SF score against percentage change in MADRS 
score, data were paired by the assigned visit number: paired 
MADRS and Q-LES-Q-SF ratings were obtained quarterly 
(ie, every 3 months) for the first year and biannually (every 
6 months) for the remaining 4 years. Of note, the Q-LES-
Q-SF and MADRS assessments for a particular month may 
have taken place on separate visits (visit window was ± 45 
days until 1 year of follow-up and ± 90 days afterward) and, 
hence, different dates. Any missing data were excluded from 
analyses if one of the observations in a pair was missing.
All post-baseline data collected in the 5-year follow-up 
were used except the missing-pair data previously 
referenced. Separate models were developed for VNS + TAU 
and TAU. For the longitudinal comparative QOL assessment 
of VNS + TAU versus TAU, a linear regression model was 
fit with the change in Q-LES-Q-SF percentage maximum 
possible score (percent max score) from baseline as the 
dependent variable and months after baseline visit as 
the predictor. Q-LES-Q-SF percent max score was used 
instead of raw score so that results could be compared 
with the MCID value obtained by Endicott et al.12 The 
analysis was subsequently repeated in unipolar and bipolar 
groups separately. Stochastic error terms for the linear 
models are assumed to follow normal distribution. Within-
patient variability was accounted for using a first-order 
autoregressive covariance structure. The best covariance 
structure was picked using the Akaike Information 
Criterion.16 To compare the change in QOL for TRD 
patients receiving VNS + TAU versus TAU for similar drops 
in MADRS score, a linear regression model was fit with the 
change in Q-LES-Q-SF percent max score from baseline 
as the dependent variable and the percentage change in 
MADRS score from baseline as the predictor.
Since both patient-reported QOL measured using 
Q-LES-Q-SF score and clinician-reported improvement 
 
■ When assessing therapeutic treatment outcomes 
for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), changes in 
depression rating scale scores may not be an adequate 
measure (ie, depression scales may not capture the 
totality of the patient-perceived clinical benefit). 
 
■ Results from this study suggest that the cumulative 
therapeutic effects of some treatments—in this case, 
vagus nerve stimulation—may be more accurately 
assessed using quality of life measures.
 
■ For TRD patients receiving adjunctive vagus nerve 
stimulation, it is important to assess for improvements 
not only in clinical depression symptoms (sleep, appetite, 
energy, etc) but also in other aspects of overall quality 
of life functioning (ability to fulfill roles, family and social 
relationships, overall well-being, etc).

in QOL measured using Clinical Global Impressions–
Improvement scale (CGI-I)17 score were available, a similar 
analysis on CGI-I data was conducted to determine if the 
results from the two QOL measures concurred. Although 
the CGI-I and Q-LES-Q-SF are not identical measures, the 
CGI-I has previously been used as a means of validating 
QOL. Similar analyses of Q-LES-Q-SF and CGI have been 
done in other work.12 A response on the CGI-I post-baseline 
was defined as a rating of 1 or 2.17 Dichotomized outcomes 
(ie, response or no response) on the CGI-I was then used to 
fit a logistic regression model with the CGI-I response as the 
dependent variable and the percentage change in MADRS 
score from baseline as the predictor for all 5-year follow-up 
data. Again, separate models were developed for VNS + TAU 
and TAU, and within-patient variability was accounted for 
using a first-order autoregressive covariance structure.
Finally, an exploratory post hoc subanalysis of the 14 
functional domains of the Q-LES-Q-SF was performed to 
analyze which domains differentiated VNS + TAU from TAU. 
A statistical model similar to the one previously described 
was employed, except the change in Q-LES-Q-SF percent 
max score from baseline was replaced with the change in 
Q-LES-Q-SF domain score from baseline as the response. A 
range of percent changes in MADRS were selected a priori 
for these domain subanalyses: 50% was chosen as this is the 
historical definition of antidepressant response, 10% was 
chosen as a point at which we would expect to observe only 
minimal change in quality of life (Q-LES-Q-SF score), 
and 30% as an intermediate value approximating the 34% 
MADRS decrease determined to be consistent with an 
improvement in QOL.
Throughout this article, estimated response curves with 
95% confidence bands are provided for both VNS + TAU 
and TAU. Non-overlapping 95% confidence bands imply 
statistically significantly different responses in the two 
arms.18 Further, overlapping confidence bands may or may 
not imply significant difference and hence are assumed to 
give inconclusive results throughout the article.
Comparison to Previously Established MCID
In a large clinical trial (N = 542) of individuals with 
non–treatment-resistant bipolar depression receiving two 
different doses of quetiapine, Endicott et al12 determined 
the MCID for the Q-LES-Q-SF to be an 11.89% max 
increase from baseline. This value represents the change 
in Q-LES-Q-SF percent max score (ie, a raw score of 14–70 
rescaled to 0–100) associated with a CGI-I assessment 
of at least “minimally improved” (ie, score of 1–3). We 
decided a priori to use this predetermined MCID value to 
compare effect sizes observed with adjunctive VNS versus 
TAU, despite the differences in the two study populations. 
Notably, the TRD patients receiving VNS in this study were 
slightly more ill: patients had mean baseline scores of 33.2 
on the MADRS and 5.2 on the CGI–Severity of Illness 
scale (CGI-S) versus 30 and 4.5, respectively, in the study 
by Endicott et al,.12
RESULTS
Sample Demographics and Disease Characteristics
For a full description of patient demographics, please see 
the article by Aaronson et al.3 Table 1 summarizes the key 
demographics of the subset of patients used for this report. 
MADRS and Q-LES-Q-SF assessments were not necessarily 
performed on the same day for many patients; however, 
the time difference between these measures (median of 4 
weeks) was similar between the two cohorts.
Longitudinal QOL Changes: VNS + TAU versus TAU
The estimated longitudinal curve for the change in 
Q-LES-Q-SF percent max score from baseline is shown 
in Figure 1. On average, there was a comparative QOL 
advantage observed for the VNS + TAU group as early as 3 
months, which was sustained throughout the entire 5-year 
duration of the study.
Change in QOL From Baseline for TRD Patients 
Receiving Adjunctive VNS + TAU Versus TAU for  
Similar Drop in MADRS Score From Baseline
Figure 2 shows a significantly larger improvement 
in Q-LES-Q-SF percent max score from baseline in the 
VNS group (VNS + TAU) compared to the TAU group 
for the same drop in MADRS score. Since estimated lines 
are approximately parallel, a combined linear regression

model with the change in Q-LES-Q-SF percent max score 
as the response, percentage change in MADRS score as the 
predictor, and a dummy treatment variable (VNS + TAU = 1 
and TAU = 0) as the covariate can be used to estimate the 
additional improvement in VNS + TAU (via estimating 
the treatment coefficient). Results from this new model 
demonstrated that a VNS + TAU patient is expected to 
have an additional mean improvement in Q-LES-Q-SF 
percent max score of 3.96 (95% CI, 2.32 to 5.61) compared 
to a TAU patient for the same drop in MADRS score. 
The trend observed is maintained in both unipolar and 
bipolar depression patients when the analysis was repeated 
separately for each subgroup. However, the result for bipolar 
depression patients was inconclusive due to greater variance 
stemming from a smaller sample size.
Furthermore, the individual model for VNS + TAU 
also estimated that, on average, VNS + TAU patients could 
achieve a clinically meaningful increase in Q-LES-Q-SF 
percent max score of 11.89 (horizontal line in Figure 2) 
when the MADRS drop from baseline is at least 34%—a 
level that is well below the “standard” 50% drop typically 
used to define antidepressant treatment response. Note that, 
on average, the TAU patients achieved the same clinically 
meaningful increase in Q-LES-Q-SF percent max score 
when the MADRS drop from baseline is much higher (at 
least 56%).
Association of QOL With CGI-I Scores
Similar to the patterns observed with Q-LES-Q-SF, using 
a logistics model, VNS + TAU patients were estimated to 
have a significantly higher probability of having a response, 
as defined by a CGI-I score of 1 or 2,17 compared to TAU 
patients (Figure 3). On average, a MADRS drop of at least 
48% is sufficient for a VNS + TAU patient to have a 50% 
chance of reaching CGI-I category 1 or 2, whereas a MADRS 
drop of at least 95% is needed for a TAU patient to have a 
50% chance of reaching a CGI-I score of 1 or 2. Because 
the estimated curves are approximately parallel, a combined 
model can estimate the odds ratio for VNS + TAU patients’ 
achieving a response compared to TAU patients for the same 
drop in MADRS score. The estimated odds ratio is 2.78 (95% 
CI, 2.17 to 3.57), providing further empirical evidence that 
the greater self-perceived improvement in QOL observed for 
VNS + TAU over TAU patients (using the Q-LES-Q-SF) is 
simultaneously being identified by clinician assessment of 
overall improvement. These improvements, as measured by 
Q-LES-Q or CGI-I, are greater for the VNS + TAU patients 
than for the TAU patients for the same drop in MADRS score.
Subanalysis of QOL Domains  
Influenced by VNS + TAU Versus TAU
An analysis was done to determine which Q-LES-Q-SF 
domains differentiated VNS + TAU from TAU. Table 2

VNS Improves Quality of Life in Depression
provides the estimated change in the domain scores 
from baseline with the 95% CIs for both VNS + TAU 
and TAU for a selected percentage change in MADRS 
score. A graph similar to Figure 2 for the individual 
domains is provided in Supplementary Figures 
2 and 3. Results show that VNS + TAU patients 
achieve greater improvements on mood, household 
activities, leisure activity, ability to function, overall 
well-being domains, social relationships, family 
relationships, and sex drive domains. TAU patients, 
on the other hand, do better on the economic status 
domain. Both groups were similar for the remaining 
domains. Because this subanalysis was post hoc and 
exploratory, the values in Table 2 were not adjusted 
for multiple comparisons.
DISCUSSION
In a very large sample of patients with highly 
treatment-resistant major depression, adjunctive 
VNS demonstrated a statistically significant 
greater improvement in quality of life than TAU. 
On average, this significant comparative QOL 
advantage of adjunctive VNS over TAU occurred 
as early as 3 months. An equally crucial finding is 
that this comparative QOL advantage was sustained 
throughout 5 years of observation. Hence, in 
comparison to the TAU cohort, as a group the QOL 
improvements with adjunctive VNS appear to persist 
in patients with TRD—a significant achievement, as 
the TRD population is notorious for exceedingly high 
symptomatic relapse.19,20 This comparative advantage 
of VNS + TAU over TAU was both observed in self-
reported QOL via the Q-LES-Q-SF and confirmed 
with clinician-reported global improvement as 
measured by the CGI-I.
Notably, this improvement in QOL observed in 
the VNS group occurred even when the total change 
in MADRS score from baseline was less than 50% 
(ie, the classical definition of depression response). In 
fact, on average, the QOL improvement for the VNS 
group was observed as long as there was a reduction 
in MADRS score of at least 34% from baseline. That 
is, using a previously published minimally clinically 
important difference for Q-LES-Q-SF of 11.89 
max percent increase from baseline,12 adjunctive 
VNS patients were making clinically significant 
improvements in QOL with MADRS score drops of 
as low as 34% from baseline.
These findings are potentially important for 
several reasons. First, as we begin to better understand 
TRD, it is becoming increasingly clear that depressed 
patients who do not respond adequately to a series of 
medications are at very low likelihood of responding 
to additional medications or to augmentation and 
combination pharmacologic strategies.19,21 This 
observation suggests that “novel” treatments, acting

aAdditional improvement in the domain score for the VNS + TAU group compared 
to the TAU group is statistically significant (without any multiplicity adjustment). 
Significance was determined by absence of overlap of confidence intervals 
between groups (TAU + VNS vs TAU) when comparing the regression of a 
given Q-LES-Q-SF domain at each MADRS percent decrease (without multiple 
comparisons).
Abbreviations: MADRS = Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, Q-LES-Q-
SF = Q-LES-Q-SF = Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire Short 
Form, TAU = treatment as usual (any antidepressant treatment[s]), VNS = vagus 
nerve stimulation, VNS + TAU = adjunctive VNS + any antidepressant treatment(s).

Conway et al
via mechanisms qualitatively different from those of standard 
antidepressant medications, may provide benefits beyond 
medications. Second, the data in this report suggest that 
adjunctive VNS may be associated with changes that provide 
enhancement of QOL in addition to benefits obtained with 
depressive symptom reduction alone. That is, patients with 
TRD receiving adjunctive VNS experience markedly higher 
improvements in QOL with considerably smaller reductions 
in depressive symptoms (34% reduction from baseline 
MADRS). This finding suggests that perhaps each individual 
antidepressant treatment modality may differentially affect 
QOL, and perhaps studies of this more virulent form of 
depression (TRD) should emphasize outcome measures 
other than simply depressive symptom scales. Lastly, the 
findings suggest that our “standard” measure of a treatment’s 
success—a 50% reduction in depressive symptoms—may 
not be an adequate measure in patients with TRD. This 
suggestion is particularly compelling, as the population of 
depressed patients studied in this trial was more ill than the 
reference group.12
Perhaps not surprisingly, patients with TRD receiving 
adjunctive VNS self-reported the greatest improvements 
in the mood domain of the Q-LES-Q-SF when compared 
to TAU patients. This could potentially be explained by the 
unique electrochemical effects of VNS, which are provided 
around the clock, as the VNS stimulator device fires at set 
intervals throughout the day, which is notably not the case 
with other neurostimulatory treatments, such as ECT and 
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), which 
are characterized by relatively brief treatment sessions and 
transient antidepressant effects in TRD, particularly when 
treatment is stopped.22,23 Brain imaging studies suggest 
that VNS may bring about its effects via changes in the 
prefrontal, cingulate, and insular cortex as well as the brain 
stem.24–26 Furthermore, cerebrospinal fluid and brain 
imaging studies suggest that dopamine may play a key role 
in the antidepressant effects of VNS.26,27 This involvement 
of the dopaminergic system may be critical, as most of the 
current antidepressants do not powerfully influence the 
dopaminergic brain pathways. In summary, our current 
understanding of the QOL improvement advantage observed 
with VNS + TAU vis-à-vis TAU is hypothetical; future studies 
that target the biological underpinnings of these advantages 
are warranted.
The post hoc subanalysis also revealed that VNS 
demonstrated a statistically significant advantage in multiple 
other functional domains measured on the Q-LES-Q-SF, 
including overall well-being, improvement in perceived 
ability to function, household activities, and leisure activities. 
This statistical significance may not be maintained with 
advantages seen in other Q-LES-Q-SF domains (eg, perceived 
physical health, ability to do work or get around). The 
advantage noted for adjunctive VNS in the sexual domain 
of the Q-LES-Q-SF is consistent with other (unpublished) 
data from the VNS registry (available from the authors), 
which demonstrated that patients receiving VNS, vis-à-vis 
TAU, showed greater improvements in sexual function using 
the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale.28 Notably, two of the 
Q-LES-Q-SF domains that showed no differential advantage 
with adjunctive VNS were “work” and “ability to work.”
It is important to keep in mind the constraints of the 
investigation when interpreting these results. First, the 
depression symptoms (MADRS) were assessed single-
blinded via offsite central raters; patients receiving either 
TAU or adjunctive VNS knew which treatment they were 
receiving when they completed the Q-LES-Q-SF. Second, 
as shown in Supplementary Table 1, there were dropouts 
with further time progression in the study, particularly in 
years 4 and 5. However, the primary finding of the study—a 
differential improvement in QOL with adjunctive VNS in 
patients whose MADRS score reductions were well below 
50%—would not be affected by this observed dropout; the 
sample size of interest is of patients with a particular MADRS 
drop, regardless of when that drop happened. Finally, the 
current sample consisted of patients with unipolar and 
bipolar TRD with severe treatment-resistant depression, 
whereas the population providing the Q-LES-Q-SF MCID 
benchmark12 consisted only of patients with bipolar 
depression. Although the sex distribution of the patient 
treatment groups was consistent with the predicted 2:1 
female-to-male ratio typically observed in major depressive 
disorder, the racial demographic of the group was highly 
skewed toward white individuals, with 97% and 91% of 
the VNS + TAU and TAU groups, respectively, being white. 
Another potential limitation of the study was that it was 
open label (ie, the treating clinicians knew which patients 
had VNS devices), which could potentially influence the 
aggressiveness of adjunctive pharmacotherapy. However, 
data collected during the registry (unpublished) indicate 
that over the course of the registry duration, there were 
more medication changes in the TAU group, supporting the 
opposite conclusion—more aggressive pharmacotherapy 
was applied in the TAU group.
In conclusion, adjunctive VNS resulted in greater 
improvements in quality of life that are well beyond what 
treatment as usual provides, and these improvements were 
sustained. Adjunctive VNS also demonstrated significant 
advantages in not only the mood domain, but also multiple 
other functional domains measured on the Q-LES-Q-SF. 
Using a pre-established MCID, quality-of-life improvements 
occurred with MADRS reductions far below the classical 
50% improvement definition of depression response.
