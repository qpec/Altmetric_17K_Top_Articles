Objective: Advanced paternal age (APA) at conception
has been linked with autism and schizophrenia in offspring,
neurodevelopmental disorders that affect social func-
tioning. The current study explored the effects of paternal
age on social development in the general population.
Method: We used multilevel growth modeling to inves-
tigate APA effects on socioemotional development from
early childhood until adolescence, as measured by the
Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) in the
Twins Early Development Study (TEDS) sample. We also
investigated genetic and environmental underpinnings of
the paternal age effects on development, using the Addi-
tive genetics, Common environment, unique Environment
(ACE) and gene–environment (GxE) models.
Results: In the general population, both very young and
advanced paternal ages were associated with altered
trajectory of social development (intercept: p ¼ .01; slope:
p ¼ .03). No other behavioral domain was affected by
either young or advanced age at fatherhood, suggesting
specificity of paternal age effects. Increased importance of
genetic factors in social development was recorded in the
offspring of older but not very young fathers, suggesting
distinct underpinnings of the paternal age effects at these
two extremes.
Conclusion: Our findings highlight that the APA-related
deficits that lead to autism and schizophrenia are likely
continuously distributed in the population.
Key words: advanced paternal age, social development,
autism, schizophrenia, neurodevelopment

A
dvanced paternal age (APA) at conception has been
linked to a number of negative neuropsychiatric
outcomes in offspring, including low academic
achievement,1 hyperactivity,1 and suicide.2 A relation with
autism and schizophrenia has been most robustly replicated
in epidemiological studies.3-6 Odds ratios for these disorders
were shown to increase in men more than 35 years old
at conception, with even higher risk observed in older
groups of fathers. Men in their 40s at conception have been
shown to have two to three times higher chances of
conceiving a child with either autism or schizophrenia,3,6-10
raisings concerns about recent increases in age at parent-
hood. Although several studies further indicated that such
effects likely persist through generations,11,12 the evidence
remains conflicting.13
Currently, there is little consensus regarding whether
the effects of APA arise due to de novo genetic mutations
that accumulate in paternal spermatogonia with age,14,15
or familial factors.16-18 Proponents of the latter hypothe-
sis postulate that men who conceive at an advanced age
are likely to do so because of their social difficulties, and
therefore themselves display mild autism/schizophrenia
traits.
Under
this
scenario,
higher
rates
of
autism/
schizophrenia among offspring of older fathers are mainly
due to stable (age-independent) characteristics of men
who delay fatherhood.
Given that both autism and schizophrenia affect normal
development19,20 and are characterized by severe social im-
pairments, as well as arise due to partly overlapping genetic
influences,21,22 robust association between these disorders
and APA
may help guide research
into
mechanisms
vulnerable to the APA effects. It has been hypothesized23
that the increased risk for autism and schizophrenia in
offspring of older fathers is mediated, at least in part, by the
influence that APA exerts on social development.
Previous animal24 and human23 studies have docu-
mented an association between APA and social functioning;
however, negative results have also been reported.25 Our
group has recently extended this line of research by using
murine models to show that the effects of APA on offspring
social behavior are developmentally dynamic,26 meaning,
compared to mice born to fathers at a standard breeding age,
those with older fathers were characterized by hyper-
sociability early in life, and hyposociability upon reaching
adulthood. Nevertheless, in contrast to a high number of
publications linking APA with outcomes measured at a
single time point (e.g., Sandin et al. and Brown et al.8,9),
studies of developmental trajectories in relation to paternal
age at conception have been lacking to date. This is despite
their methodological adequacy: if the offspring of older fa-
thers show a developmental delay but can compensate for it

 later in life, such patterns could be missed in studies that
considered their outcomes at only one time point. Moreover,
differences in the social functioning observed between peo-
ple with autism and the general population are likely dy-
namic,
resulting
from
disruptions
in
the
process
of
acquisition/refinement of some social skills, for example,
theory of mind,27 and such developmental nature should be
reflected in the design of studies exploring origins of this
disorder.
Here we hypothesized that the same mechanisms that
link APA with the risk of developmental disorders could
also interfere with normal maturation processes across the
behavioral traits underlying these conditions. In other
words, offspring of older fathers could display develop-
mental differences akin to, but less severe than, those
observed in clinical cases (Figure 1). This would be in line
with the model postulating that psychiatric disorders
represent quantitative extremes of normally distributed
traits.28-31 For example, various degrees of autistic-like
social impairment are present across the entire popula-
tion, and the trait is thought to be only quantitatively,
rather than qualitatively, different when displayed by cases
and controls.32 Both quantitative33 and molecular genetics
studies34 suggest overlapping genetic effects on diagnosed
autism and individual differences in subclinical autism
traits.
The present study uses a population-based, nationally
representative cohort of twins (Twins Early Development
Study [TEDS]35) to examine the effects of paternal age on the
developmental trajectories in children. Lundstr€
om et al.36
previously showed that, in the same sample, the APA ef-
fects were observed in a nonclinical population at the
offspring age of 9. Our design allows us to trace the devel-
opment of these effects, examining how early such effects
emerge, as well as their subsequent life course. Although
paternal influences were of primary interest in this study,
the TEDS sample includes detailed background information
that also enabled us to assess how behavioral changes over
childhood are affected by maternal age at conception, con-
trolling for other important confounders. This allowed us to
tease out independent contributions of parental ages to
offspring development, while controlling for other de-
mographic factors.
In line with our hypothesis, the focus remained on the
effects of APA on social development. However, to explore
possible specificity of these influences, we also analysed
other
behavioral
dimensions,
including
hyperactivity,
conduct, peer problems, and emotionality. Although these
domains strongly affect social functioning, and have been
shown to be altered in subpopulations of individuals with
autism and schizophrenia,37-39 they do not class as core
symptoms of either of these disorders. Finally, the twin
structure of our sample allowed us to indirectly test the
competing hypotheses regarding de novo versus familial
genetic influences driving the effects of APA.
METHOD
Sample
The study used the TEDS sample, a large nationally representative
cohort of British twins.35 The total sample consists of more than
15,000 twin pairs with detailed phenotypic data, collected longi-
tudinally. Measures relevant for social functioning were assessed in
these individuals around the ages of 4, 7, 9, 14, and 16 years.
Exclusion criteria for our analyses were as follows: (1) confirmed
autism diagnosis, assessed at age 12 years through the Develop-
ment and Well-Being Assessment40 (DAWBA), which was shown
to have high sensitivity (0.88) and specificity (0.85) for ASD41 in the
TEDS sample; (2) other medical exclusions/being a perinatal
outlier (any of: birth weight <471 g, >97 days of special care after
birth, >74 days of hospital stay after birth, born before 27th week
of gestation, maternal alcohol drinking of >14 units per week
during pregnancy); and (3) uncertain zygosity—all standard ex-
clusions for this cohort and for community samples. We decided to
exclude the individuals with autism to limit the possibility that the
association between paternal age and social development in our
study is driven by higher rates of the diagnosis in the older
paternal age categories (previously shown in the TEDS sample36).
As we recognized that by doing so we might have truncated part of
the social development continuum, all analyses were also run in
the full sample.
Measures
Social development was investigated using parents’ (predominantly
mothers’) ratings of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire
(SDQ).42 The SDQ was designed to provide a succinct tool for
assessing both good and problematic aspects of behavior in children
aged 4 to 16 years. The five subdomains include conduct problems,
emotional symptoms, hyperactivity, peer problems, and prosocial
behavior. In line with the goals of the current study, the prosocial
subdomain was of main interest in our analyses; however, we tested
the effects of paternal age on all SDQ dimensions to investigate the
specificity of possible effects on social development. Each sub-
domain is assessed through five questions scored from 0 to 2, so that
the maximum score in each subdomain is 10; unlike the other sub-
domains, high scores in prosocial domain indicate less problematic
behavior. The data in the current study came from years 4, 7, 9, 12,
and 16 data collection waves, with only prosocial items available for
the last time point.

fathers do not meet the criteria for clinical diagnosis of autism/
schizophrenia (red line), their developmental profile is shifted

 Statistical Analysis
All analyses were performed using R version 3.1.043, OpenMX,44
and STATA 14.
To create paternal age categories (PAC) used for obtaining
paternal age�specific behavioral trajectories, we used the age range
cut-offs specified by Lundstr€
om et al. (2010)36: <25, 25 to 34, 35 to 44,
45 to 50, and >51 years (PAC 1�5 levels). Age, sample size, maternal
age, socioeconomic status (SES) and sex composition were recorded
for each paternal age group. Given that there were few much older
mothers in our sample, the categorization for the maternal age
differed: <20, 21 to 30, 31 to 40, and >40 years (maternal age cate-
gory [MAC] 1–4 levels). Correlations between maternal and paternal
ages were estimated using Pearson’s product�moment correlation
coefficient.
Multilevel (Mixed) Models for Longitudinal Data
The developmental change in the SDQ scores can be described in
terms of their intercept and slope (growth curve coefficients).
Whereas the intercept reflects the mean group value at the starting
point, the slope reflects the developmental growth. For example,
higher initial sociability was indicated by high values of the proso-
cial intercept, and increase in sociability over time by its positive
slope. Significant effects of paternal age on the slope coefficients
would suggest that social development is influenced by father’s age
at conception. Using longitudinal data from a twin registry, we
adjusted for the within-family and within-individual correlation of
the data by using multilevel (/mixed) modeling (R package lme4).
Details of the model specification are provided in the supplementary
material, available online.
In all adjusted analyses, we controlled for the effects of age of
the
other
parent,
SES
(index
of
parent
qualifications
and
employment, and mother’s age at birth of first child), sex, and
zygosity. We investigated the effects of parental age as both a
categorical and continuous variable. Given that the former
necessitated multiple pairwise comparisons, we controlled for
multiple testing using the false discovery rate (FDR) method (all
p values present postadjustment scores). To obtain smooth curves
based on the results of these models, we used locally weighted
scatterplot smoothing.
Twin Model�Fitting Analysis
In the second stage, we investigated the extent to which individual
differences in growth curve coefficients (intercept and slope) could
be explained by latent genetic and environmental effects, as well as
how these effects change with paternal age.
Our prediction was that the degree to which the between-
individual variance in social development could be attributed to
environmental and genetic factors would change across paternal
age range. We hypothesized that developmental patterns would be
affected primarily by environmental factors in the offspring of
younger fathers, with these factors having little impact on children
born to middle-aged and older men. Conversely, our prediction
was that genetic sources of variance would become more promi-
nent in the offspring of older fathers. To investigate these as-
sumptions, we tested nonlinear (quadratic) effects of paternal age
on genetic and environmental variance components. To retain focus
on the paternal age effects and to avoid multiple testing, twin
modeling on the slope and intercept scores was performed in
relation to paternal but not maternal age, and only on the SDQ
domains where we observed significant effects of paternal age in
multilevel models.
As for the growth curve modeling, paternal age was treated as
either a categorical (Additive genetics, Common environment and
unique Environment [ACE] analysis) or continuous (gene–environ-
ment [GxE] analysis) moderator in the twin analyses. Both methods
are described below, and further detail regarding these models can
be found in the supplementary material, method, and Tables S1 to
S20, available online.
ACE Analysis. ACE analysis allows us to disentangle contribu-
tion of genetic and environmental factors to the trait variance. All
analyses were run in both the full sample and stratified by paternal
age (PAC 1�4 categories; PAC4 and PAC5 groups were collapsed
for these analyses because of insufficient number of individuals
with very old fathers to perform twin analyses). While the full-
sample analysis informs about the degree to which development
parameters are heritable in the population, stratification by father’s
age at conception allowed us to observe whether the heritability
estimates are stable across different paternal age groups. For all
analyses, we used the slope and intercept scores, computed indi-
vidually for all twins. To obtain standardized genetic and envi-
ronmental variance components, we ran ACE and AE models for
the SDQ coefficients. The standardized A, C, and E components are
referred to as h2, c2, and e2. (For more details on these models, see
Rijsdijk and Sham45 or Neale and Maes.46)
GxE Analysis. To gain further insights into the potential
moderating effects of paternal age on the genetic and environ-
mental variance components, we also ran a GxE model. This
allowed us to investigate whether the degree to which genetic or
environmental factors affect social development changes continu-
ously with paternal age. To limit the possibility that the moderating
effects of paternal age on these factors are due to genetic correlation
between age at fatherhood and social development, paternal age
effects were regressed out of the growth curve coefficients before
fitting the GxE model. For all individuals with missing data on
paternal age, the variable was imputed at the sample mean (33.37
years).

PATERNAL AGE ALTERS SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT
 RESULTS
Cohort Characteristics
There
was
a
significant,
positive
correlation
between
paternal and maternal ages (R ¼ 0.61, p < .001). Table 1
presents demographics of the sample stratified by paternal
age group.
Developmental Trajectories: SDQ—Prosocial Domain
Paternal Age as a Continuous Variable. In the developmental
analysis, the quadratic model produced a better fit than the
linear one, for both the intercept and the slope (intercept:
c2 ¼ 9.60, df ¼ 1, p < .001; slope: c2 ¼ 4.97, df ¼ 1, p ¼ .03).
Effects of paternal age on both of the coefficients were sig-
nificant in the crude (Table S1, available online) and adjusted
models
(interceptadj: b
¼
1.37E�3,
p
¼
.01;
slopeadj:
b ¼ �1.39E�4, p ¼ .03). The shape of the association was an
inverted U for the slope, and was U-shaped for the intercept
coefficient (respectively, negative and positive quadratic
estimates). This indicated that offspring of fathers at the
extreme ends of paternal age distribution tended to have the
highest initial sociability scores, but showed less develop-
mental change than other groups. The same patterns were
recorded in the full sample with no exclusions (Table S3,
available online).
Pairwise
Comparisons. Results
were
validated
in
the
models using paternal age as a categorical variable (PAC1-
5). Initial prosocial scores were highest in the offspring of the
oldest fathers (PAC5), followed by the youngest paternal age
group (PAC1). Over time, scores increased in all groups, but
least so for the offspring of the youngest and oldest fathers,
who, in the final assessment, were lagging behind offspring
of fathers in their mid-20s to mid-40s at conception (Figure 2,
Table 2). These results were exemplified by statistically sig-
nificant differences in the intercepts and slopes presented in
Table S4 (crude model) and Table S9 (fully adjusted model),
available online. Analysis of the full sample (no exclusions)
revealed the same patterns (Tables S17 and S18, available
online).
Trend analyses and pairwise comparisons indicated no
significant differences in either the intercept or the slope of
the prosocial scores in relation to maternal age at conception.
SDQ—Other Domains
Pairwise
comparisons
indicated
that
paternal
age
at
conception was associated with differences in conduct
problems, emotionality, and hyperactivity (Tables S4�S8,
available online). These effects nonetheless disappeared in
the adjusted model. Results from the full models indicated
that young maternal age is associated with developmental
differences in all of these domains. Offspring of younger
mothers had higher hyperactivity and conduct, but lower
emotionality scores in early development in comparison to
mothers who were middle-aged at conception (Tables S12,
S14, and S16, available online). Neither paternal nor
maternal effects were significant in developmental anal-
ysis in which parental ages were treated as continuous
variables.
Paternal Age Effects on Heritability of Social
Development
Given that the twin correlations did not suggest dominance
effects (Table S19, available online), we fitted the ACE
model for the prosocial scores coefficients. Shared envi-
ronmental effects (C) were present in the analyses stratified
by paternal age, but not in the full sample (Table S20,
available online); therefore, we report ACE and AE models,
respectively.
Analyses in the full sample suggested the variance in the
prosocial scores intercept and the slope was influenced
predominantly by genetic factors (Table 3). The stratified
analyses revealed higher genetic and lower environmental
influences on both the intercept and the slope variable in the
offspring of the oldest fathers (PAC4); however, the differ-
ence between this and other groups was not significant
(overlapping CIs).
GxE analyses indicated no significant moderating effects
of paternal age on either genetic or environmental variance
in social development.
DISCUSSION
The results of this study demonstrate that paternal age
contributes to individual differences in social development
in the general population, with no similar effects on other
behavioral domains. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first time that a longitudinal approach was used to show
such effects outside the clinical extremes. Our findings
highlight that the effects of paternal age on social develop-
ment may range from mild alterations in the typical matu-
ration patterns to severe clinical phenotypes. This indicates
that some children born to older fathers may experience

 difficulties in social settings, and the challenges that they
face may increase as they get older, even if they do not meet
any diagnostic criteria. Our suggestion that the mechanisms
involved in social development are particularly vulnerable
to the APA effects can help to explain the robust association
between the APA and autism and schizophrenia, and creates
new testable hypotheses regarding molecular underpinnings
of the effects observed in our sample.
Our results also suggested that the genetic influences on
social development parameters become more pronounced in
the offspring of the oldest group of fathers, in line with our
predictions that these effects likely follow a nonlinear tra-
jectory. We could not, however, verify the de novo versus
inherited nature of these effects in the GxE model, likely
because of insufficient power to estimate such nonlinear ef-
fects in our sample.
Trajectories of Social Behavior
Social development was the main focus of this study, as
this domain is notably affected in the disorders with most
established associations with APA.23,24 To assess the social
maturation curve, we analyzed the changes in the SDQ
prosocial scores between the ages of approximately 4 and
16 years. To investigate whether paternal age effects are
specific to prosocial domain or manifest themselves also in
other behavioral dimensions, we also explored their in-
fluence on hyperactivity, emotionality, conduct, and peer
problems.
Although all behavioral domains measured in the SDQ
likely affect social functioning, psychometric data support a
five-factorial structure of the SDQ, indicating the separate-
ness of the behavioral constructs reflected in each of the
subscales.47 It is therefore plausible to hypothesize that the
SDQ domains will be underlain by different genetic and
environmental factors, and therefore that APA could selec-
tively affect only some of them. Although it was recom-
mended that, in certain settings, using three- rather than
five-factor structure (internalizing: emotionality and peer
problems; externalizing: conduct and hyperactivity; and
prosocial) may be preferential,48 prosocial behavior is

PATERNAL AGE ALTERS SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT
 considered
a
construct
distinct
from
the
other
SDQ
measures, even under this protocol.
Our analyses indicated that SDQ prosocial trajectories
were significantly altered in relation to paternal age at
conception. Individuals with the youngest and oldest fathers
received the highest parental ratings for prosocial behavior
early in life (indicated by high SDQ intercept scores).
However, these groups showed the least developmental
change, and by the end of the assessment period displayed
less prosocial behavior than the individuals born to fathers
in the middle of the paternal age distribution. There were no
differences in development in other domains related to
paternal age at conception.
Importantly, these results fit the epidemiological data
linking APA with disorders associated with social deficits,
and expand previous findings from animal models. In a
study in mice, we previously showed that offspring of aged
fathers shifted from increased to decreased sociability be-
tween early development and adulthood,26 patterns resem-
bling those identified here. Such convergence of findings
from animal and human studies is particularly encouraging,
given the complementary strengths of these methodologies.
Conclusions drawn from our animal study had to be taken
with caution due to limitations in the experimental design
(measuring sociability at two time points only, using
different sets of inbred animals on both occasions). These
problems could be addressed in the current study, where
measures from up to five time points were considered
within the same individuals. On the other hand, the murine
study provided evidence that the differences in offspring
most likely arose de novo (no differences in paternal
behavior), as they occurred even when both familial genetic
and environmental factors were strictly controlled. Obtain-
ing similar results from these two studies reduces the like-
lihood
that
either
murine
or
human
results
are
just
artifactual and can be explained solely by the limitations
inherent in the methods.
The patterns seen in both species may suggest a degree
of disinhibition or lack of selectivity in the early social
approach of offspring born to aged fathers. Further studies
exploring whether early increase in sociability occurs to a
level that could be considered inappropriate, and ideally
augmenting
these
results
with
molecular
and
neuro-
imaging data, will be necessary to fully understand the
results of this study. However, it is interesting to note a
parallel with findings from a study of infants at genetic risk
of autism. Jones and Klin (2013)49 reported decreasing rates
of looking at the eye region of faces from 2 to 6 months in
those infants later diagnosed with autism. This abnormal
trajectory reflected, in part, higher rates of looking at eyes
at 2 months compared to those of typically developing

Our study sample offered a scope to investigate the ge-
netic and environmental underpinnings of the observed
developmental trajectories of social behavior, and to es-
timate how they change in relation to paternal age at
conception.
We hypothesized that genetic variance in developmental
measures would be moderated by paternal age only in
offspring of very old fathers, and environmental variance
only in offspring of very young fathers. Under this model,
our results from the social trajectory analysis, although
similar in these two groups, have distinct genetic and envi-
ronmental underpinnings. These predictions are in line with
previous
research
suggesting
qualitative
differences
in
paternal age effects between the two extremes of the paternal
age distribution50 and exponential increase in de novo mu-
tations in paternal spermatogonia.15 The results from the
twin analysis stratified by paternal age supported this
notion,
indicating
stable
heritability
estimates
in
the
offspring of men <45 years old at conception, with a sharp
increase in the offspring of older fathers. These trends,
however, were not validated in the GxE analysis, likely
because of insufficient statistical power in our sample to
estimate such nonlinear effects.
An alternative explanation for the lack of significant
results in the GxE analysis is that paternal age effects on
social function arise mostly because of familial influences,
that is, that there is a correlation between genetic factors
influencing age at conception and social development. If
paternal age at conception affects prosocial scores pre-
dominantly via such familial (non�de novo) genetic factors,
regressing out the genetic effects on age at fatherhood
would result in nonsignificant effects of paternal age on the
genetic variance, as we recorded in the GxE model. Lack of
significant effects of the GxE analysis, therefore, does not
allow us to disentangle whether the increase in heritability
in the offspring of the oldest fathers observed in the ACE
model is more likely due to familial or to de novo factors.
Although our earlier study in mice suggested that these
former effects were unlikely (mice were inbred, and group
differences recorded in offspring were not detected in their
fathers), our current results did not provide support for this
notion.
Maternal Age Effects
Although maternal age effects were not of primary interest
in our study, our results indicated that very young
maternal age at conception is associated with a number of
developmental differences. Offspring of young mothers
showed increased levels of hyperactivity and conduct
problems, as well as lower emotionality. This partly cor-
roborates previous results showing association between
young
maternal
age
and
externalizing
problems.51,52
Although the effects of young motherhood on offspring
adversity can be explained partly by lower SES53 and
obstetric complications,54 there is evidence suggesting
possible
association
between
contribution
of
familial
genetic55 factors.
Although evidence suggests that the APA effects could be
particularly strong in female offspring (higher disorder
risk,3,6 earlier onset and worse prognosis56), due to the small
number of offspring with parents in the oldest categories, we
could not investigate sex-specific trajectories. In our model,
offspring sex was included as a covariate. Future studies

 should investigate whether females born to older men
depart from their expected (typical) developmental patterns
more than males.
Furthermore, although parental age categories used in
this study were based on previous research (e.g., Lundstr€
om
et al., 2010),36 their determination was somewhat arbitrary.
Given the complex and nondeterministic nature of the APA
effects—with most offspring of aged parents experiencing no
behavioral difficulties—the use of mixed-effects growth
models in the future could help to identify more homoge-
neous (latent) subgroups. Subsequent analyses could deter-
mine whether these subgroups are enriched in offspring
with fathers from any particular age range. Additional
integration of biological data will help attribute these effects
to factors such as total de novo burden, DNA methylation
alterations in candidate regions, or neuroimaging results,
allowing one to test new hypotheses about the biological
underpinnings of the APA effects.
In conclusion, in this study paternal age specifically
affected developmental trajectories of offspring social be-
haviors, as indexed by the prosocial subscale of the SDQ.
Results of APA effects in the study sample were comparable
to observations in recent animal models, with both sug-
gesting developmental reversal from hyper- to hyposoci-
ability in the offspring of men in either the lower or upper
extreme of paternal age. &
