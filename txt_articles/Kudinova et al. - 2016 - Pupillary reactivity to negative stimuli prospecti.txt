Abstract
There is a large body of research supporting the association between disrupted physiological 
reactivity to negative stimuli and depression. The present study aimed to examine whether 
physiological reactivity to emotional stimuli, assessed via pupil dilation, served as a biological 
marker of risk for depression recurrence among individuals who are known to be at a higher risk 
due to having previous history of depression. Participants were 57 women with a history of Major 
Depressive Disorder (MDD). Pupil dilation to angry, happy, sad, and neutral faces was recorded. 
Participant’s diagnoses and symptoms were assessed 24 months after the initial assessment. We 
found that women’s pupillary reactivity to negative (sad or angry faces) but not positive stimuli 
prospectively predicted MDD recurrence. Additionally, we found that both hyper and hypo 
pupillary reactivity to angry faces predicted risk for MDD recurrence. These findings suggest that 
disrupted physiological response to negative stimuli indexed via pupillary dilation, could serve as 
a physiological marker of MDD risk, thus presenting clinicians with a convenient and inexpensive 
method to predict which of the at-risk women are more likely to experience depression recurrence.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of disability worldwide with an 
estimated 350 million of people affected (“WHO | Depression,” 2012). Women are nearly 
twice as likely to experience MDD than men, thus representing a population that is 
particularly vulnerable to developing MDD (Kessler et al., 1993). Depression is a highly 
recurrent disorder and up to 60% of individuals who experience an initial MDD episode are 
expected to relapse within 5 years following recovery (Bulloch et al., 2014; Burcusa and 
Lacono, 2007; Solomon et al., 2000). Recurrent MDD is characterized by distinct genetic, 
neurobiological and hormonal profiles (Admon et al., 2014; Holsen et al., 2013; Levinson et 
al., 2003), transmits a greater risk for more severe and chronic consequences (Burcusa and

 Lacono, 2007; Lewinsohn et al., 1999), and is less responsive to antidepressant medication 
(Kaymaz et al., 2008). Thus, the identification of reliable and easily measurable markers of 
risk is critical for aiding clinicians in predicting which women who have recovered from an 
initial MDD episode are at greatest risk for relapse. This will allow clinicians and policy 
makers to channel limited resources to those most in need.
A rapidly growing body of research highlights the role of dysregulated neurophysiological 
reactivity to negative stimuli as a potential biological marker of depression risk (e.g., Price et 
al., 2015; Siegle et al., 2001). Both hyper- and hypo-reactivity in brain regions involved in 
visual emotive processing, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) ventromedial 
prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in response to 
emotional stimuli in patients with MDD have been reported by neuroimaging studies 
(Bermpohl et al., 2009; Davidson et al., 2003; Fales et al., 2009; Gotlib et al., 2005; Grimm 
et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2015; Keedwell et al., 2005; Kumari et al., 2003; Tao et al., 2012). 
These patterns of hyper- and hypo-reactivity have also been linked to differential 
antidepressant treatment response (Williams et al., 2015). Specifically, Williams et al. found 
that nonresponders showed pre-treatment hyper-reactivity in the amygdala, followed by 
post-treatment hypo-reactivity to sad stimuli, compared to controls. In contrast, responders 
showed hypo-reactivity compared to controls at baseline, which normalized to levels similar 
to those observed in controls by the end of treatment, suggesting that both hypo and hyper 
amygdala reactivity could be associated with MDD (Williams et al., 2015). Additionally, 
findings from studies that used measures of emotional reactivity other than fMRI, provide 
support for both decreased and increased reactivity among participants with current MDD 
diagnosis and those who are at a greater risk for developing MDD (Bylsma et al., 2008; 
Cohen et al., 2005; Kovacs et al., 2009; Kujawa et al., 2012; Lethbridge and Allen, 2008; 
Pine et al., 2001).
Providing a peripheral measure of cognitive and emotion processing, there is evidence that 
the pupil dilates in response to stimuli associated with cognitive load and emotional intensity 
(Hess and Polt, 1960; Siegle et al., 2003a). Pupil dilation has also been linked to activity in 
brain regions associated with the processing and regulation of emotion, including DLPFC, 
VMPFC, amygdala, inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), superior frontal gyrus (SFG), and ACC, 
such that greater blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activity in those areas was 
associated with greater pupil dilation (Siegle, Steinhauer, Stenger, Konecky, & Carter, 2003; 
Urry et al., 2006). Specifically, modulation of negative affect corresponded to changes in 
pupil diameter, such that participants who displayed higher activation in the left IFG and 
SFG clusters when they were instructed to decrease negative emotions evidenced higher 
pupil dilation (Urry et al., 2006). Additionally, activity in ACC, which is thought to be 
related to tasks that require heightened control due to emotional and cognitive interference, 
was reported to be positively associated with pupil dilation during the Stroop task, and 
higher magnitude of ACC activation predicted increased pupil dilation during error-related 
trials (Critchley et al., 2005). There is also evidence that pupil dilation can serve as a reliable 
index of activity in the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic (LC-NA) neuromodulatory system, 
which is essential for a broad range of cognitive and emotional processes (Gilzenrat et al., 
2012; Hermans et al., 2013; Murphy et al., 2014, 2011). Both hypo- and hyper-activity of the 
LC-NA system are thought to be associated with emotion dysregulation and affective

 disorders, including depression (Aston-Jones et al., 1999). Moreover, disrupted LC-NA 
transmission is associated with depression-like behaviors, including learned helplessness and 
insomnia, in animals (Pavcovich and Ramirez, 1993).
Notably, pupillometry is a relatively inexpensive and accessible measure of cognitive-
affective processing that could be easily used in clinicians’ offices for assessing risk. 
Importantly, there is a small but growing body of research suggesting that pupil dilation to 
emotional stimuli may be associated with depression risk. Importantly, there is evidence for 
the association of both increased and decreased pupillary reactivity to negative emotional 
stimuli and depression diagnosis, treatment success, and risk. For example, there is evidence 
that individuals with current MDD evidence increased pupil dilation to negative stimuli 
compared to never depressed participants (Siegle, Steinhauer, Carter, et al., 2003). Pre-
treatment sustained pupil dilation in response to negative stimuli, in combination with initial 
symptom severity, has also been shown to predict remission rates following cognitive-
behavioral therapy among patients with MDD (Siegle, Steinhauer, Friedman, Thompson, & 
Thase, 2011). Specifically, the findings suggested that remission was associated with low 
sustained pupil dilation to negative stimuli and high initial severity of depression. Decreased 
pupil dilation to emotional stimuli has been reported among never depressed individuals 
who are at a higher risk for MDD due to having a parent with MDD (Bistricky et al., 2014). 
Lastly, increased pupil dilation to sad faces has been found to prospectively predict 
depression onset among children of mothers with a history of MDD (Burkhouse et al., 
2015). Despite the strengths of these studies, it is still unclear whether pupil dilation in 
response to negative information predicts MDD recurrence risk in adults.
In this study, we sought to examine whether pupil dilation to emotional stimuli prospectively 
predicts depression risk in a group of individuals known to be at heightened risk: those with 
previous history of MDD. Given that women are at a higher risk for MDD than men, 
(Kessler et al., 1993), we focused exclusively on women. Based on previous research 
suggesting that the association between depression and changes in pupil dilation was 
stronger for negative stimuli, compared to positive information (Burkhouse et al., 2015; 
Siegle et al., 2011) we hypothesized that pupillary reactivity to negative (sad or angry faces) 
but not positive stimuli would prospectively predict MDD recurrence. We also sought to 
examine the potential role of hyper- versus hypo-reactivity to emotional stimuli. In addition 
to examining whether high versus low pupillary reactivity predicted risk for MDD 
recurrence, we also examined whether both high and low pupillary reactivity may be a 
marker of risk. Given evidence that emotion dysregulation and depression are characterized 
by both increased and decreased activity in DLPFC, VMPFC, and ACC, as well as hypo and 
hyper LC-NA activation, all of which are indexed by pupil dilation, we hypothesized that 
both hyper- and hypo-pupillary reactivity would predict risk for MDD recurrence.
Method
Procedure
Potential participants were recruited from the community through a variety of means (e.g. 
newspaper and TV advertisements), as part of a larger study of intergenerational 
transmission of depression. Women responding to the advertisements were screened over the

 phone and eligible participants were invited to participate with their children. Upon arrival to 
the laboratory, participants provided informed consent, were administered the SCID-I, and 
completed computer-based tasks. Follow-up assessment occurred every 6 months for 24 
months (5 assessments total), during which participants were administered the SCID-I to 
assess for new episodes of MDD. Of the 57 participants who completed the Time 1 
assessment, 51 (89.5%) completed Time 2, 48 (84.2%) completed Time 3, 41 (71.9%) 
completed Time 4, and 38 (66.6%) completed Time 5. If a participant missed an 
appointment, the following appointment covered any diagnoses that occurred since their last 
completed assessment. Importantly, our use of survival analysis accommodates differing 
duration of follow-up by focusing both on whether and when the event (diagnosis) occurred 
during follow-up. Participants who did not experience an MDD recurrence during the 
follow-up, regardless of the duration of the follow-up for that individual were treated as right 
censored in the analysis (cf. Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007). For example, for participants who 
dropped out after Time 4 assessment, we coded the time variable as 18 months, signifying 
that those participants did not relapse during the participation in our study1.
Participants who completed all of the assessments did not differ significantly from those 
who missed one or more assessments on any of the baseline demographic, clinical, or pupil 
variables (lowest p = .07), except annual family income. Participants with missing data had 
significantly lower annual family income (35,001–40,000), compared to participants with no 
missing data (55,001–60,000). Participants were compensated $275 for their participation in 
all 5 assessments. All study procedures were approved by the Binghamton University’s 
Institutional Review Board.
Participants
Participants were 57 women with a past history of MDD recruited from the community. The 
average age of women in the study was 39.21 (SD = 6.99, Range = 24–55). The majority of 
participants were Caucasians (85.5%) and the rest were African America (3.6%), American 
Indian (1.8%), Multiracial (3.6%) or from other racial/ethnic groups (5.5%). The median 
annual family income was $40,001–45,000.
Measures
Lifetime histories of psychiatric disorders were assessed using the Structured Clinical 
Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I; First, Spitzer, Gibbon, & Williams, 2002). 
A subset of 20 SCID-I interviews was coded by a second interviewer and inter-rater 
reliability for diagnoses of MDD was excellent (κ = 1.00). Exclusion criteria included the 
presence of schizophrenia, a history of alcohol or substance dependence within the last six 
months, or lifetime history of bipolar disorder. All of the participants had a past history of 
one or more episodes of MDD. None of the participants had current MDD, psychotic, 
obsessive-compulsive, or eating disorders. Twenty one percent of the participants (n = 12) 
met criteria for current anxiety disorder. During the follow up, 19 women met criteria for a 
new MDD episode.
1There were no significant differences in pupil findings across the two eye trackers.

 Participants’ current symptoms of depression and anxiety were assessed via the Beck 
Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II; Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996) and the Beck Anxiety 
Inventory (BAI; Beck & Steer, 1993), respectively. In this sample, both measures showed 
excellent internal consistency (BDI-II: α = .91; BAI: α = .92).
Pupil dilation was assessed in a moderately lit room using Tobii T60 & T60XL eye-trackers2 
(Falls Church, VA), while participants viewed full-color images of actors displaying various 
emotions (angry, happy, sad, and neutral) taken from a standardized stimulus set 
(Matsumoto and Ekman, 1988). The stimuli consisted of emotional and neutral photographs 
from each actor, morphed to form a continuum of 10% increments between the two 
photographs. Each emotion is represented by four continua (two male and two female 
actors), for a total of 12 continua. Eleven morphed images were used from each continuum, 
representing 10% increments of the two emotions ranging from 100% neutral (0% target 
emotion) to 100% target emotion (e.g., 90% neutral, 10% sad; 80% neutral, 20% sad; and so 
on). Each trial started with a fixation cross, presented for 500ms. The pictures were then 
presented, one at a time in random order, in the middle of the screen for 3 s and the 
participant was asked to indicate which emotion was being displayed (angry, happy, sad, and 
neutral) by pressing a corresponding button on a keypad. The intertrial interval randomly 
varied between 750 ms and 1000 ms. The stimuli were 16.51 cm high and 20.32 cm wide 
and 16.51 cm high and participants sat 65 cm for the screen, yielding a visual angle of 
14.48° × 17.77°. Participants completed 264 trials (88 trials per emotion) with a break after 
132 trials. To provide an adequate number of trials for pupillary analyses within each morph 
level, images were binned into three separate morph conditions for analyses: low (0%, 10%, 
20%, and 30%), medium (40%, 50%, and 60%), and high (70%, 80%, 90%, and 100%). 
Because our previous findings from children in this study suggested that the strongest 
pupillary effects are observed at the highest morph level (Burkhouse et al., 2015, 2014), the 
present study focused solely on images at the highest morph level (29.33 trials)3. Descriptive 
statistics for participants’ responses to each facial emotion type at the highest morph level 
are shown in Table 1. Change in pupil dilation in response to angry, sad, and happy faces is 
depicted in Figure 1. During this task, pupil size was recorded using the eye trackers, which 
took measurements every 16.7 ms (60 Hz) for 3 s following the onset of each facial stimulus. 
Data were cleaned using Siegle et al.’s (2008) recommended procedures. Trials comprised 
of over 50% blinks were omitted, which resulted in the exclusion of an average of 10% of 
trials per participant (Range 0–41%; SD = 11%). Following standard procedures, linear 
interpolation was used to replace blinks throughout the data set and the data were smoothed 
using a 10-point weighted average filter. The total number of rejected trials and the 
percentage of pupil data that was replaced with linear interpolations were not significantly 
correlated with women’s depressive symptoms at baseline or with their likelihood of 
developing a depressive episode during the follow-up (lowest p = .20). The relative 
luminance of the images of angry faces (120.33 arbitrary units [AU]) was significantly 
higher than the relative luminance of the images of happy (110.15 AU) and sad (114.84 AU) 
faces. The relative luminance of the images in the latter two groups also differed 
2The findings of the study were maintained when we only focused on participants who completed Time 5 assessment.
3There were no significant linear or quadratic effects of peak pupil dilation to angry, happy, or sad faces at low and medium morph 
levels (lowest p >.12).

 significantly. Effects associated with a light-reflex that were independent of stimulus type 
were removed by subtracting the mean waveform across all three valences from the average 
waveform for each valence (Franzen et al., 2009). The average pupil diameter over the 333 
ms preceding the onset of the stimulus was subtracted from pupil diameter after stimulus 
onset to produce stimulus-related pupil dilation. Peak stimulus-related pupil dilation was 
calculated by taking the maximum pupil response on average across all trials for each 
valence (angry, happy, and sad). No outliers were identified using boxplots for peak pupil 
dilation to angry, happy, or sad faces. Peak pupil dilation to angry faces was correlated with 
peak pupil dilation to sad, r = .26, p = .05 and happy faces, r = .31, p = .02, with no 
correlation between peak pupil dilation to happy and sad faces, r = .04, p = .76.
Results
We conducted a survival analyses to assess whether peak pupil dilation to emotional stimuli 
assessed at baseline predicted MDD recurrence during the 2-year follow-up period. As noted 
earlier, we examined both linear and nonlinear effects of peak pupil dilation to emotional 
faces at high levels of Morph.2 Specifically, in the first step of the model, we entered the 
linear effect of peak pupil dilation. To examine nonlinear effects, we added a quadratic peak 
pupil dilation variable in the second step of the Cox regression model for survival analysis, 
which allowed us to determine whether this quadratic effect explained significant unique 
variance in MDD risk beyond that accounted for by the linear effect. Focusing first on the 
predictive validity of peak pupil dilation to sad faces, we found that the linear effect of peak 
significantly predicted women’s time to MDD recurrence, β = −1.66, Wald = 3.78, p = .05. 
This suggests that women who evidenced decreased peak pupil dilation to sad faces 
experienced MDD recurrence sooner during a two-year follow-up, compared to women who 
exhibited moderate or increased peak pupil dilation. Specifically, the odds of participants 
with low peak pupil dilation to sad faces experiencing MDD recurrence were approximately 
five times higher than participants with higher peak pupil dilation to sad faces. When the 
quadratic effect was added in the second step, it was not significant, β = −5.43, Wald = 1.88, 
p = .17. To visually depict the significant linear effect, we plotted the results for women in 
the upper and lower quartiles of pupillary reactivity to sad faces. As shown in Figure 2, 
women who evidenced lower, compared to higher, peak dilation to sad faces experienced a 
shorter time to MDD recurrence over the follow-up. To examine the robustness of these 
findings and the predictive validity of peak pupil dilation beyond baseline symptoms, we 
tested whether the effect would be maintained when we statistically controlled for the 
influence of baseline levels of depression and anxiety. Although these results were 
maintained when we statistically controlled for the impact of anxiety symptoms (BAI), β = 
−1.82, Wald = 4.16, p = .04, they were reduced to a nonsignificant trend when we 
statistically controlled for the baseline depressive symptoms (BDI-II), β = −1.50, Wald = 
2.78, p = .10.
Focusing next on the predictive validity of peak pupil dilation to angry faces, we found that 
the linear effect of participants’ pupil peak dilation to angry faces was not significant in the 
first step of the survival analysis, β = −.90, Wald = .37, p = .54. However, when the 
quadratic effects of peak pupil dilation was added in the second step, it was significant, β = 
16.32, Wald = 8.60, p = .003. To visually depict these findings, we plotted the results for

 women in the upper and lower tertiles of peak pupil dilation to angry faces, as well as those 
at the median. As can be seen in Figure 3, women exhibiting either high or low peak pupil 
dilation to angry faces, compared to those exhibiting more moderate peak pupil dilation, 
were at greatest risk for MDD recurrence during the follow-up. This result was maintained 
when we statistically controlled for the impact of current depressive, β = 12.34, Wald = 9.81, 
p = .002, or anxiety, β = 9.22, Wald = 5.55, p = .02, symptoms suggesting that it was at least 
partially independent of participants’ current mood at the baseline assessment. Given the 
significant results observed for both the linear effect of peak pupil dilation to sad faces and 
the quadratic effect of peak pupil dilation to angry faces, we included both in the same 
survival analysis (as well as the linear effect of peak pupil dilation to angry faces) to 
determine if both were uniquely predictive of MDD risk. In this analysis, the quadratic effect 
of peak pupil dilation to angry faces remained significant, β = 15.65, Wald = 8.49, p = .004, 
but the linear effect of peak pupil dilation to sad faces was reduced to nonsignificant, β = 
−1.61, Wald = 3.30, p = .07, suggesting that peak pupil dilation to angry faces was a stronger 
predictor of MDD risk in this sample. In regards to participants’ peak pupil dilation to happy 
faces, the results showed no significant linear, β = .69, Wald = .44, p = .51, or quadratic, β = 
−5.74, Wald = 1.27, p = .26, effects on MDD recurrence.
To examine the unique contribution of peak pupil dilation to each of the three emotions, we 
conducted two additional survival analyses, one that included linear effects for each emotion 
type (to examine the robustness of our finding for pupil dilation to sad faces) and one that 
included both linear and quadratic effects of peak pupil dilation to all three emotions (to 
examine the robustness of findings for pupil dilation to angry faces). We found that, when 
only linear effects of peak pupil dilation were included in the survival analysis, decreased 
peak pupil dilation to sad faces was the only significant predictor of shorter time to MDD 
recurrence (β = −1.74, Wald = 3.71, p = .05), but not peak pupil dilation to angry (β = −.72, 
Wald = .21, p = .65) or happy (β = 1.24, Wald = 1.33, p = .25) faces. However, when 
quadratic effects of peak pupil dilation to all three emotions were included in the second 
analysis, the quadratic effect of peak pupil dilation to angry faces was the only significant 
predictor of time to depression recurrence (β = 15.31, Wald = 7.14, p = .008), but not the 
quadratic effects of peak pupil dilation to happy (β = −8.85, Wald = 2.26, p = .13) or sad (β 
= −5.13, Wald = 1.58, p = .21) faces. We should also note that, once the quadratic effects 
were added to the model, the significant linear effect of peak pupil dilation to sad faces was 
reduced to nonsignificant (β = −1.30, Wald = 1.12, p = .29). To provide a more practical 
example of the predictive validity of women’s peak pupil dilation to angry faces, a total of 
47.4% of women who evidenced low peak pupil dilation to angry faces (lowest tertile) and 
36.8% of women who evidenced high peak pupil dilation to angry faces (highest tertile) 
experienced MDD recurrence during the 2-year follow-up, compared to 15.8% of women 
who evidenced moderate peak pupil dilation to angry faces (middle tertile).
Discussion
In this study, we examined whether pupillary reactivity to negative stimuli could be used to 
determine which women with a prior history of MDD are at greatest risk for recurrence. 
Building from evidence that MDD and MDD risk may be associated with both hyper and 
hypo reactivity to negative stimuli, we examined both linear and nonlinear effects of peak

 pupil dilation. We found that, among women with a history of prior MDD, risk of MDD 
recurrence was greatest among those who exhibited either hyper or hypo peak pupillary 
reactivity angry facial stimuli, compared to those who exhibited a more moderate peak 
pupillary response during a two-year follow up. These findings were maintained when we 
statistically controlled for the influence of depressive and anxiety symptom levels at 
baseline, suggesting that peak pupil dilation to angry faces contributes unique risk for MDD 
recurrence beyond current symptom elevations. It was also maintained when we statistically 
controlled for the influence of peak pupil dilation to sad faces, suggesting that it is uniquely 
predictive of MDD risk. Although we also found that decreased peak pupil dilation to sad 
stimuli prospectively predicted MDD recurrence, this finding appeared to be less robust. 
Specifically, although the findings were maintained when we statistically controlled for 
baseline anxiety symptoms, it was reduced to a nonsignificant trend when we statistically 
controlled for baseline depressive symptoms and when we controlled for peak pupil dilation 
to angry faces. Future research is needed, therefore, to determine the role of pupillary 
reactivity to sad faces in (women’s) risk for MDD recurrence. Finally, consistent with 
previous research (Burkhouse et al., 2015) and our prediction, peak pupil dilation in 
response to viewing happy faces was not a significant predictor of depression onset.
The current findings extend previous research in several important ways. First, the findings 
are consistent with research showing that depression is associated with dysregulated 
physiological reactivity to negative stimuli (e.g., Mayberg, 2003). Although the precise 
neural mechanisms underlying these effects cannot be determined because the pupil is 
enervated by the connections from multiple brain regions (Critchley et al., 2005; Siegle et 
al., 2011; Urry et al., 2006), they are consistent with the a priori hypothesis that both hypo 
and hyper reactivity in DLPFC, VMPFC, ACC, and the LC-NA system would be associated 
with depression. Specifically, findings from neuroimaging studies reported that both hypo 
(Fales et al., 2009; Ritchey et al., 2011; Siegle et al., 2007) and hyper (Bermpohl et al., 
2009; Elliott et al., 2002; Grimm et al., 2009) activity in the DLPFC was linked to MDD. 
Findings from the studies that examined activity in VMPFC were also similar and suggest 
that MDD association with both hyper (Keedwell et al., 2005) and hypo (Guo et al., 2015) 
activity during emotive processing. Similarly, both hypo (Davidson et al., 2003; Kumari et 
al., 2003) and hyper (Gotlib et al., 2005; Tao et al., 2012) activity in the ACC was associated 
with MDD. Additionally, previous studies have suggested that both hypo and hyper LC-NA 
activity was associated with depression (Ressler and Nemeroff, 2000). Relying on previous 
research that employed pupil dilation as a peripheral marker of LC-NA system functioning 
(Gilzenrat et al., 2012; Murphy et al., 2014), the current report provides initial support that, 
to the extend that pupil dilation reflects LC-NA functioning and activation of DLPFC, 
VMPFC, and ACC, both hypo- and hyper-activity in response to angry facial stimuli 
prospectively predict risk for MDD relapse among at-risk individuals.
The current findings also suggest that pupillary reactivity to negative stimuli (perhaps 
specifically angry faces) may be a promising biomarker of risk for MDD recurrence among 
women with a history of MDD. Specifically, in the current study, peak pupil dilation in 
response to angry faces was a more robust predictor of depression onset than peak pupil 
dilation to sad faces. Most studies that found differences in pupillary reactivity in individuals 
with and without depression employed negative words without assigning them to sad or

 angry categories (e.g. Steidtmann, Ingram, & Siegle, 2010). Studies that used images of 
faces found that pupillary reactivity specifically to sad faces predicted depressive symptoms 
and onset among at risk children (Burkhouse et al., 2015). However, resent research on 
attention biases among individuals with remitted depression found evidence for selective 
attention specific to angry faces (Sears et al., 2011; Woody et al., 2015). Thus, together with 
previous research, our findings suggest that, among individual with a history of MDD, 
physiological reactivity to stimuli that evoke feelings of guilt or indicate interpersonal 
rejection (e.g. angry faces) may be a better prediction of recurrence than physiological 
reactivity to self-referential stimuli (e.g. sad faces). If replicated, these findings could aid 
clinicians in identifying which individuals with a prior MDD history are at a greater risk of 
recurrence using an inexpensive and convenient methodology. This could help focus the 
limited clinical resources and direct aid to the population who are at the highest risk of 
MDD recurrence.
The present study had several strengths, including the longitudinal design and focus on a 
readily accessible and easily measurable physiological marker (Siegle et al., 2003b). 
Although firm conclusions must await replication, the current findings provide promising 
initial evidence that peak to negative stimuli could serve as a biological marker of depression 
risk in adult women with a history of MDD and may help identify which of those individuals 
are at greatest risk for MDD recurrence. Despite these strengths, the current study has a 
number of limitations, which could provide direction for future research. First, the current 
study focused only on risk for MDD relapse and did not examine whether pupillary 
reactivity may also predict first onsets. Thus, future studies are needed to determine whether 
peak pupil dilation to negative stimuli may be a biomarker of risk for both recurrence and 
first onsets of MDD. Second, only 19 women experienced MDD recurrence during follow-
up in our sample and the findings need to be replicated by future studies using larger 
samples. Third, the current sample was primarily Caucasian, middle-class women, and 
future research is needed to determine whether the results will generalize to other 
populations. Additionally, the images were not equated on luminance and there were 
significant differences in relative luminance based on emotion category. However, the effects 
associated with light-reflex were removed prior to analyses. Moreover, the main research 
question of this study was focused on individual differences in peak pupil dilation to images 
within each emotion category. Lastly, given that pupil is enervated by connections from 
multiple brain areas, we are unable to clarify a specific brain mechanism underlying the 
findings. Additionally, it remains unclear whether the same brain areas are involved in the 
association between both hypo and hyper peak pupil reactivity and MDD recurrence or 
whether different brain areas underlie the link between hypo versus hypo peak pupil 
reactivity to angry faces and MDD recurrence.
In summary, the current findings extend previous research and suggest that pupillary hypo- 
or hyper-reactivity to angry faces stimuli may be a promising biomarker of risk for MDD 
recurrence in at-risk populations. This is the first study that has examined whether disrupted 
physiological reactivity to negative stimuli prospectively predicted depression recurrence 
among women with a prior history of MDD. If replicated, these findings suggest that 
pupillary reactivity could be used as a biomarker to determine which at risk individuals are

those most at need.
