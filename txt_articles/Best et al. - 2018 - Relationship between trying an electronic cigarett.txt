background This study examines whether young never 
smokers in Scotland, UK, who have tried an e-cigarette 
are more likely than those who have not, to try a 
cigarette during the following year.
Methods Prospective cohort survey conducted in four 
high schools in Scotland, UK during February/March 
2015 (n=3807) with follow-up 1 year later. All pupils 
(age 11–18) were surveyed. Response rates were high 
in both years (87% in 2015) and 2680/3807 (70.4%) 
of the original cohort completed the follow-up survey. 
Analysis was restricted to baseline ’never smokers’ 
(n=3001/3807), 2125 of whom were available to follow-
up (70.8%).
Results At baseline, 183 of 2125 (8.6%) never smokers 
had tried an e-cigarette and 1942 had not. Of the young 
people who had not tried an e-cigarette at baseline, 249 
(12.8%) went on to try smoking a cigarette by follow-
up. This compares with 74 (40.4%) of those who had 
tried an e-cigarette at baseline. This effect remained 
significant in a logistic regression model adjusted for 
smoking susceptibility, having friends who smoke, family 
members’ smoking status, age, sex, family affluence 
score, ethnic group and school (adjusted OR 2.42 (95% 
CI 1.63 to 3.60)). There was a significant interaction 
between e-cigarette use and smoking susceptibility 
and between e-cigarette use and smoking within the 
friendship group.
Conclusions Young never smokers are more likely 
to experiment with cigarettes if they have tried an 
e-cigarette. Causality cannot be inferred, but continued 
close monitoring of e-cigarette use in young people is 
warranted.
InTRoduCTIon
In the UK and many other countries, e-cigarette use 
among young people is largely confined to those 
who have already tried tobacco and is mostly exper-
imental in nature.1 2 That is, most young people who 
have never tried tobacco smoking, hereon referred 
to as never-smokers, do not engage in regular e-cig-
arette use that is sustained over time. Nevertheless, 
there remains concern that trying an e-cigarette 
could ease the pathway to experimentation with 
tobacco smoking for young never-smokers.
Eight longitudinal studies, all conducted in the 
USA with follow-up after 63 4 and/or 12 months,5–10 
have explored the relationship between e-cigarette 
use and smoking initiation in young never-smokers. 
They found that young people who had ever used 
an e-cigarette at baseline were more likely to have 
tried a cigarette by follow-up.
Most of the evidence from prospective cohort 
studies of young never smokers, e-cigarette use 
and smoking initiation has come from the USA. It 
is important this evidence can be compared with 
studies from different countries because varied 
national contexts, such as different tobacco control 
regulations, historical and cultural factors around 
tobacco use, availability and supply of products, 
ethnic composition of the population and invest-
ment in advertising of products, make it difficult 
to generalise findings across national boundaries. 
For example, in Poland 27.4% of adolescents 
report using an e-cigarette in the past month.11 
Poland is a major European tobacco and e-cigarette 
producer. Recently smoking rates have increased 
among Polish female adolescents although they 
are stable in men12–14 and by late adolescence most 
Polish e-cigarette users are dual users (tobacco 
and e-cigarette use). A recent study found 21.8% 
of students (16–18 
years) were dual users and this 
was not associated with reduced cigarette consump-
tion compared with tobacco-only users.15 The case 
of Poland highlights the potential role of national 
factors such as tobacco production and industry 
involvement in affecting levels of use in young 
people.
In Scotland, the prevalence of cigarette smoking 
among young people has steadily fallen over the 
last two decades. In 2015, only 2% of 13 
year olds 
and 7% of 15 
year olds were regular smokers.16 
However, current smoking among young people 
aged 16–24 
years in Scotland is significantly higher 
at 21%.17 This disparity suggests that smoking initi-
ation may now be delayed until early adulthood. 
Therefore early risk factors for later smoking initia-
tion require further investigation.
Previous cross-sectional research has shown a 
positive association between e-cigarette use and 
weakened intentions not to smoke in children 
aged 10–11 years in Wales.1 Recently the ever 
use of e-cigarettes among young non-smokers has 
increased in Scotland with 10% of non-smoking 
15 
year olds having tried them in 2013 and 24% 
in 2015.16 Levels of regular e-cigarette use among 
young people in Wales have also increased with 
2.7% of young people aged 11–18 
years reporting 
using them at least once a week in 2015.18 These 
increases were preceded by a marked growth in the

retail availability of e-cigarettes with the proportion of retailers 
with displays of e-cigarettes doubling between 2013 and 2014.19 
When this study was conducted, within store advertising and 
promotion of e-cigarettes was not regulated and there was no 
age restriction on the legal purchase of e-cigarettes in the UK. 
This study is one of the first to examine e-cigarette use and ciga-
rette experimentation in a UK longitudinal sample.
MeThods
The data presented here are drawn from the Determining 
the Impact of Smoking Point-of-Sale Legislation Among 
Youth (DISPLAY) study.20 The DISPLAY study is a 5-year multi-
modal study designed to measure the impact of UK legislation to 
ban point-of-sale displays of tobacco products on the smoking 
attitudes and behaviours of young people. One element of the 
DISPLAY study is an annual school survey conducted in four 
Scottish secondary schools located in communities that differ 
in terms of their socioeconomic and urban–rural profiles. The 
data presented here are from the 2015 and 2016 surveys which 
included all pupils (aged 11–18) in the four schools. All four 
schools had pupils across the age range 11–18 years and a break-
down of participant numbers by school and by year group is 
given in table 1. The survey was administered by class teachers 
under exam conditions and took on average 40 
min to complete. 
Pupils who were absent on the day of the survey were given 
opportunity during the following 2 
weeks to complete the survey.
Ethical approval was obtained from the University of St 
Andrews, University Teaching and Research Ethics Committee 
(UTREC). Parental opt-out consent was obtained prior to pupils 
completing the survey. Pupils also provided active consent by 
completing the survey.
derivation of variables
Smoking status
Respondents were asked “Have you ever smoked cigarettes or 
hand-rolled cigarettes (roll-ups), even if it is just one or two 
puffs?” to which they could respond ‘yes’ or ‘no’. Young people 
who responded ‘no’ were deemed to be never-smokers at that 
point.
E-cigarette use
Respondents were asked whether or not they had heard of e-cig-
arettes. Pupils who answered that they had not heard of e-ciga-
rettes were routed past further questions on e-cigarettes. Pupils 
that had heard of e-cigarettes were then asked “Which ONE of 
the following is closest to describing your experience of e-ciga-
rettes/vapourisers/shisha pens?” with response options of ‘I have 
never used them’, ‘I have tried them once or twice’, ‘I use them 
sometimes (more than once a month)’ or ‘I use them often (more 
than once a week)’. Young people who responded that they had 
never heard of e-cigarettes were coded as having ‘never used 
them’.
For the logistic regression analysis, due to low frequencies in 
the categories reflecting regular use, participants were divided 
into those who had never tried e-cigarettes versus those who had 
tried e-cigarettes.
Susceptibility to smoking
Susceptibility to smoking was assessed through two questions 
“If one of your friends offered you a cigarette or hand-rolled 
cigarettes (roll-ups), would you smoke it?” and “Do you think 
you will smoke a cigarette or hand-rolled cigarettes (roll-ups) at 
any time during the next year?”. The response option for these 
questions was ‘definitely yes’, ‘probably yes’, ‘probably not’ and 
‘definitely not’. If respondents answered anything other than 
‘definitely not’ to either of these questions then they were coded 
as being susceptible to smoking. These measures of smoking 
susceptibility have been used in related studies6 and are based on 
validated measures.21
Number of friends and family who smoke
Respondents were asked “How many of your friends smoke ciga-
rettes or hand-rolled cigarettes (roll-ups)?” and could respond 
‘most of them’, ‘about half of them’, ‘some of them’, ‘none of 
them’ or ‘don’t know’. ‘Don’t know’ responses were coded as 
missing and then a binary variable was generated distinguishing 
those who responded ‘none of them’ versus any other response.
Respondents were asked “which if any of the following people 
smoke cigarettes or hand rolled cigarettes (roll-ups)?”. Options 
included their mother or female carer, father or male carer, 
brother (eldest if more than one) and sister (eldest if more than 
one). A binary variable was created splitting participants who 
had responded that any of these family members smoked versus 
those that reported no smokers in their immediate family.
Demographic variables
Respondents were asked their gender, ethnic group and date 
of birth. Individual family material well-being was assessed 
through the Family Affluence Scale (FAS).22 The FAS consists of 
four questions (own bedroom, number of family cars, number 
of computers and number of family holidays abroad per year). 
The FAS raw scores were transformed though categorical prin-
cipal component analysis into single-dimensional scores that 
were then divided into tertiles of high, medium and low FAS.

Analysis
Analysis was conducted in Stata V
.14 (StataCorp).
Never smokers were divided into those who had tried an 
e-cigarette at baseline and those who had not and these groups 
were compared in terms of the proportion of participants that 
reported having experimented with cigarettes by follow-up. 
Tobacco experimentation in this study was defined as any ciga-
rette use, even just one or two puffs.
Multivariate logistic regression was used to control for poten-
tial confounding factors—sex, age, ethnicity, family affluence, 
smoking within the family, smoking by friends and susceptibility 
to smoking. The model was built in three blocks, first with only 
e-cigarette use and smoking-related variables as independent 
variables and in the second block demographic variables were 
added and an indicator for school was included in the model. 
Including school as a covariate makes explicit the effect of 
school as school-level smoking norms are an important influ-
ence on smoking behaviour.23 In the third block interactions 
between e-cigarette use, smoking susceptibility and smoking 
within friendship group were included. The risk ratio (RR) for 
the unadjusted model was obtained from a binomial log-linear 
regression and for the adjusted models a Poisson regression 
model with a robust variance estimator.24
To test the effect of missing data on the parameter estimates, 
we used multiple imputation by chained equations (Stata V
.14: 
mi impute chained). Further information on the imputation 
procedure is given in the online supplementary materials.
ResulTs
sample characteristics
In 2015, there were 3001 never smokers in our sample, of 
these 9.4% had tried an e-cigarette. T
wenty-six per cent were 
coded as susceptible to smoking, 32.8% had a family member 
who smoked and 23.8% reported having at least one friend who 
smoked.
Our final sample included 2125 young people for whom we 
had data on e-cigarette use and smoking status at baseline and 
follow-up. Of these, 183 (8.6%) had tried an e-cigarette at base-
line and 1942 (91.4%) had not. Table 1 shows the year group 
distribution of the sample by school.
Relationship between baseline e-cigarette use and smoking 
status at follow-up in baseline never smokers
Of the young people who had tried an e-cigarette at baseline 
(n=183), 74 (40.4%) went on to initiate smoking cigarettes 
by follow-up. This compares with 249 (12.8%) of those who 
reported never having used an e-cigarette at baseline (n=1942) 
and went on to initiate smoking cigarettes by follow-up. Table 2 
shows the bivariate relationship between e-cigarette use in 2015 
and smoking status in 2016.
logistic regression on ‘experimented with cigarettes by 
follow-up’
Baseline e-cigarette use is a significant predictor of experi-
mentation with cigarettes. In an unadjusted model, the OR for 
ever-smoking at follow-up in ever e-cigarette users versus never 
e-cigarette users was 4.62 (95% CI 3.34 to 6.38), giving a RR 
of 3.15 (95% CI 2.55 to 3.89). Table 3 below shows the ORs, p 
values and 95% CIs for the OR for each of the models. All the 
models below were adjusted for sex, age centred on the mean 
(ie, individual age minus the mean age of the sample) FAS, ethnic 
group and school.
Model 1 RR for e-cigarette use is 1.72 (95% CI 1.31 to 2.26), 
model 2 RR for e-cigarette use is 4.09 (95% CI 2.57 to 6.52), 
RR for e-cigarette*susceptibility interaction is 0.43 (95% CI 
0.25 to 0.72), RR for e-cigarette*friend smokes interaction 0.62 
(95% CI 0.39 to 0.99), model 3 RR for e-cigarette use is 4.22 
(95% CI 2.83 to 6.36), RR for e-cigarette*susceptibility interac-
tion is 0.41 (95% CI 0.26 to 0.64) and RR for e-cigarette*friend 
smokes interaction 0.65 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.97).
Figure 1 shows that the impact of having tried an e-cigarette at 
baseline on probability of tobacco experimentation at follow-up 
is much greater for young people who were non-susceptible to 
smoking at baseline. The contrast of predicted probabilities is 
significant (χ2=53.93, 
p<0.001).
Figure 2 shows that the impact of having tried an e-ciga-
rette at baseline on probability of tobacco experimentation at 
follow-up is much greater for young people who have no friends 
who smoke. The contrast of predicted probabilities is significant 
(χ2=4.91, p=0.042).
Further information on characteristics of missing cases is given 
in online supplementary materials. To test the effect of missing 
data on our parameter estimates we used multiple imputation 
by chained equations. Model 3 shows the estimates from an 
imputed model (m=100). The model estimates are stable under 
complete case analysis and imputation.

Research paper
published longitudinal studies of the relationship between e-cig-
arettes and tobacco experimentation in young people from the 
USA,3–9 providing further confirmation in a non-US context.
It is possible that the relationship between e-cigarettes and 
tobacco experimentation may not be causal if young never-
smokers who try an e-cigarette would have gone on to initiate 
smoking anyway due to being already favourably disposed 
towards tobacco use. In other words, it is possible that e-ciga-
rette use and tobacco experimentation have common liability25 
and the former is incidental to tobacco experimentation. To 
address this possibility, we controlled for factors associated 
with transition to smoking such as smoking susceptibility26 and 
smoking among friends and family27 in the analysis. However, 
even when these items were included in the model e-cigarette 
use remained a significant predictor of cigarette experimenta-
tion. Importantly, there was also an interaction between smoking 
susceptibility and e-cigarette use and between e-cigarette use and 
having friends who smoked. These data indicate that e-cigarette 
use had a greater effect on the odds of cigarette experimentation 
in young people not traditionally thought to be high risk, that is, 
those with a firm intention not to smoke and/or those with no 
smokers in their friendship group.
There is some evidence from other studies that young people 
who try e-cigarettes before tobacco have different characteristics 
to those who go straight to smoking. Wills and colleagues28 found

Research paper
that those who used an e-cigarette first were less rebellious and 
more likely to receive social support from their parents. Miech 
and colleagues10 found that young never-smokers who had tried 
e-cigarettes were more likely to move away from the percep-
tion that cigarettes were a ‘great risk’ over the following year. 
Wills and colleagues29 also found that young never smokers who 
used e-cigarettes were also more likely to increase their positive 
smoking expectancies (such as beliefs that smoking would make 
them more confident, help them relax and reduce boredom) and 
were more likely to become friends with smokers and subse-
quently try smoking. However, with only 1-year follow-up these 
studies were not able to determine whether changes in expectan-
cies or affiliations preceded smoking. Further research on this 
topic is required over longer follow-up periods.
Schneider and Diehl have outlined a ‘catalyst model’ of e-cig-
arette influence on smoking uptake in adolescence.30 This is 
intended as an alternative to 'gateway theory'31 32 as an expla-
nation of the relationship between e-cigarette and tobacco use. 
They break the process down into two stages: factors influencing 
transition from ‘no use’ to ‘e-cigarette use’ and then the factors 
influencing the second stage of transition from ‘e-cigarette use’ 
to ‘tobacco use’. The first-stage mechanisms include easing the 
process of initial trial, for example, with sweet flavours. The 
second-stage mechanisms include increased accessibility and 
learning of smoking rituals. Thus, there are a number of paths 
within the catalyst model whereby e-cigarette use, even single 
trial, might facilitate smoking uptake. There are also pathways 
by which e-cigarettes could mitigate against a transition to 
regular smoking. For those young people who are curious to try 
the performative aspects of smoking (the hand to mouth action 
and inhalation process), the act of trying e-cigarettes may result 
in lower motivation to try tobacco smoking.
Levy and colleagues have modelled the public health impacts 
of e-cigarettes and estimate that under a range of conditions, 
e-cigarettes may have a positive net impact on public health 
at a population level because of the greater benefits conferred 
on smokers relative to the potential harm to young people.33 
Further studies could usefully examine e-cigarette use, smoking 
and smoking-related attitudes over longer time periods to deter-
mine the conditions under which e-cigarettes enhance adult quit 
rates without facilitating uptake in young people.
The importance of research findings about the relationship 
between e-cigarette use and smoking initiation has been debated 
on the basis that most e-cigarette use among young people is 
occasional and therefore unlikely to be directly harmful or be 
sufficient to influence other behaviours. However, some argue 
that the influence of e-cigarette experimentation may be psycho-
social rather than chemical; it has been suggested that e-ciga-
rettes ‘(convey) to young apprehensive would-be smokers that 
nicotine is a benign drug and potentially weaken the established 
message that smoking kills’.34 E-cigarette advertising has empha-
sised the commonalities between the products with the message 
that e-cigarettes can give the psychological and social benefits 
of smoking without the health or social costs.35 There are some 
signs that these messages confuse young people about the harms 
of smoking. For example, a recent study found that after viewing 
an e-cigarette advert young people were more likely to rate occa-
sional cigarette smoking as less harmful.36
At the time this research was conducted there were no legal 
restrictions on sales or advertisement of e-cigarettes. However, 
in the UK e-cigarettes are now banned from sale to people under 
1837 38 and advertising on television, print media and radio is 
prohibited under the Tobacco Products Directive and associated 
UK regulations,39 40 although at present point-of-sale marketing 
is still permitted. It will be important to ascertain if this legis-
lation is sufficient to prevent or reduce the numbers of young 
people trying e-cigarettes.
strengths and limitations
The strengths of this study are its prospective design, large 
sample and high response and follow-up rates. Importantly, the 
multiple imputation models indicate that model estimates are not 
biased by missing data. However, there are a number of limita-
tions. First, most of the young people whom we categorised 
as having initiated smoking may have only taken one or two 
puffs of a cigarette during the follow-up period. Therefore, we 
do not know whether any of these young people will transition 
to regular smoking. Transition from never-smoker to smoker is 
often conceptualised as a multistep pathway.41–43 Recent research 
suggests that any experimentation with cigarettes is a strong 
predictor of transition to regular smoking, with experimentation 
at baseline identifying two-thirds of regular smokers at 2-year 
follow-up with a false positive rate of only 8%.44
Second, participants were drawn from only four schools in 
Scotland and therefore may not be representative of the Scottish 
school population. However, comparison of the demographic 
characteristics of our sample with a nationally representative one 
does not indicate any significant deviation.45 Third, the study is 
based on self-reports and we do not yet know the reliability of 
young people’s self-reported use of e-cigarettes.
The age range of the sample (11–18 years) is broader than in 
some other research in this area. Therefore, we split our sample 
in half by age and repeated the analysis on the split samples. 
The results we obtained were the same and are presented in the 
online supplementary materials.
Finally, although we have used validated measures of smoking 
susceptibility, they were developed more than 20 years ago and 
there may be other aspects of common liability to tobacco and 
e-cigarette use that are not assessed by existing measures of 
susceptibility.
ConClusIons
This UK longitudinal study found that young never-smokers 
who try e-cigarettes are at elevated risk of initiating smoking 
compared with young never-smokers who do not try e-cig-
arettes. Further research with longer follow-up is required to 
discover how many of the full sample of young people, if any, 
transition to regular smoking and to explore the longitudinal 
relationship between use of e-cigarettes and changes in attitudes 
to smoking. Careful and regular monitoring of smoking rates 
and e-cigarette use among young people is necessary over the 
What this paper adds
 
► Eight prospective studies in the USA have reported a 
temporal relationship between trying an e-cigarette and 
subsequent experimentation with cigarettes.
 
► Consistent with the US studies, this study indicates a positive 
relationship between e-cigarette use in never smokers and 
their subsequent first experimentation with cigarettes by 
follow-up 1 year later.
 
► This UK study found that e-cigarette use had a greater impact 
on the odds of cigarette experimentation in young never 
smokers not traditionally thought to be high risk, that is, 
those with a firm intention not to smoke and/or no smokers 
in their friendship group.
