Abstract
Hypocalcemia is a metabolic disorder that affects dairy cows during the transition from 
pregnancy to lactation. Twelve multiparous Holstein cows and twelve multiparous 
Jersey cows were intravenously infused daily for approximately 7 days prepartum 
with either saline or 1.0 mg/kg bodyweight of the immediate precursor to serotonin 
synthesis, 5 hydroxy-l-tryptophan (5-HTP). On infusion days, blood was collected before, 
after, and at 2, 4, and 8 h postinfusion. Blood and urine were collected daily before the 
infusion period, for 14 days postpartum and on day 30 postpartum. Milk was collected 
daily during the postpartum period. Feed intake and milk yield were unaffected by 
5-HTP infusion postpartum. Cows infused with 5-HTP had elevated circulating serotonin 
concentrations prepartum. Infusion with 5-HTP induced a transient hypocalcemia in 
Jersey cows prepartum, but not in any other treatment. Holstein cows infused with 
saline had the highest milk calcium on the day of and day after parturition. Postpartum, 
circulating total calcium tended to be elevated, and urine deoxypyridinoline (DPD) 
concentrations were elevated in Holstein cows infused with 5-HTP. Overall, Jerseys had 
higher urine DPD concentrations postpartum when compared with Holsteins. Taken 
together, these data warrant further investigation of the potential therapeutic benefit 
of 5-HTP administration prepartum for prevention of hypocalcemia. Further research 
should focus on delineation of mechanisms associated with 5-HTP infusion that control 
calcium homeostasis during the peripartum period in Holstein and Jersey cows.

Introduction
Hypocalcemia is a costly and potentially fatal disease that 
 
affects dairy cows most prominently during the transition 
from pregnancy to lactation. During these 3 weeks pre- 
and postpartum, the dairy cow is predisposed to major 
metabolic changes that put significant demands on 
both energy and calcium reserves. Calcium, the major 
mineral in milk, is needed for bone formation in the 
growing neonate. Dairy cows will produce anywhere

from 1 to 20 
kg of colostrum. Depending on parity, 
milk production will increase by approximately 10 
kg 
in the first 5 days postpartum (Kessler et al. 2014). With 
such a dramatic increase in milk production, enormous 
demands are exerted on body calcium reserves for transfer 
into milk. The early lactation dairy cow is often incapable 
of replacing circulating calcium stores, resulting in 
hypocalcemia.
Clinical hypocalcemia (less than 1.4 
mmol/L total 
circulating calcium) has a prevalence of between 5 and 
10% in the United States dairy cow population, while the 
subclinical form of the disease (1.4–2.0 
mmol/L) occurs at 
a greater (25–50%) incidence (Goff 2008, Reinhardt et al. 
2011). Hypocalcemia is considered a ‘gateway disease’. 
Following parturition, the demand for calcium is typically 
the first major metabolic challenge, making the cow 
vulnerable to a host of further negative health outcomes. 
For example, calcium is required for both smooth muscle 
contraction and proper immune function, in addition to 
many intracellular functions (Martinez et al. 2014). In 
the dairy cow, smooth muscle contraction is responsible 
for rumen and gut motility as well as uterine and teat 
sphincter contraction (Kimura et al. 2006, Goff 2008). 
Dysregulation of these physiological functions as a result 
of low calcium leads to many other common transition 
period diseases, including ketosis and fatty liver, 
displaced abomasum, dystocia, metritis, and mastitis 
(Kimura et al. 2006, Goff 2008, Martín-Tereso &  
Verstegen 
2011, Chapinal et al. 2011). In addition, subclinical 
hypocalcemia specifically has been linked to greater risk 
of fever, as well as decreased pregnancy rates and longer 
intervals to pregnancy (Martinez et al. 2012). Overall, 
hypocalcemia is considered a major health event in the 
life of the cow, as it predisposes her to diseases in current 
and future lactation cycles. This is of particular concern in 
older cows of all breeds and all Jersey cows, both of which 
have an increased predisposition to hypocalcemia (Oetzel 
et al. 1988, Lean et al. 2006). Limited research is available 
to establish why Jersey cows have an increased incidence 
of hypocalcemia. Two main explanations have focused 
on either the increased milk production per unit of body 
weight or the potential reduced concentration of vitamin 
D receptors in Jersey cows versus Holstein cows (Oetzel 
et al. 1988, Goff et al. 1995). A gap in understanding of the 
breed-dependent mechanisms regulating hypocalcemia 
still exists. Additionally, despite the economic and 
animal health ramifications of hypocalcemia, limited 
preventative options are available for application by 
the dairy industry. The limitation in preventative 
applications is further compromised by the lack of a 
cost- 
effective, on-farm method available to measure 
blood  
calcium  
concentrations in individual cows (McArt 
& Oetzel 2015). Broader preventative strategies against 
hypocalcemia are needed. We propose that administering 
a serotonin precursor, 5-hydroxy-l- 
tryptophan (5-HTP), 
and subsequently increasing circulating serotonin levels 
during the immediate prepartum phase, may offer a 
powerful 
preventative 
strategy 
against 
postpartum 
 
hypocalcemia.
Serotonin 
is 
an 
evolutionarily 
conserved 
monoamine, signaling via approximately 15 receptor 
isoforms throughout the mammalian body to exert a 
wide range of physiological effects (Matsuda et al. 2004, 
Hannon & Hoyer 2008). Serotonin is synthesized in a 
two-step pathway, with the formation of 5-HTP being the 
rate-limiting step (Wang et al. 2002). During lactation, 
non-neuronal serotonin acts as a homeostatic regulator of 
the mammary gland in rodents, dairy cows, humans, and 
likely many other species (Stull et al. 2007, Hernandez et al. 
2012a, Horseman & Hernandez 2014, Laporta et al. 2015). 
Importantly, serotonin modulates calcium homeostasis 
in rodent models (Hernandez et al. 2012b, Laporta 
et al. 2013a, 2014a) through a pathway involving the 
mammary-derived molecule parathyroid hormone-related 
protein (PTHrP). The PTHrP hormone has a definite role in 
calcium modulation during lactation (Wysolmerski et al. 
1995, Wysolmerski 2010, Hernandez et al. 2012b). Despite 
the well-established relationship between serotonin and 
calcium homeostasis in various rodent models, limited 
research has been reported in dairy cows, even with 
their susceptibility to calcium insults at parturition. To 
date, our lab has demonstrated that manipulation of the 
serotonergic system impacts calcium regulation in late-
lactation, nonpregnant, homeostatically stable dairy cows 
(Laporta et al. 2015). Additionally, calcium and serotonin 
are positively correlated on the day of parturition in both 
Holstein and Jersey breeds (Laporta et al. 2013b, Moore 
et al. 2015). We have begun to establish a model in which 
a transient hypocalcemia provokes release of mammary-
derived PTHrP, which can then act on bone to release 
calcium for transfer into milk: a process that is regulated 
by serotonin (Laporta et al. 2014b). However, the impacts 
of serotonin on calcium homeostasis in Holstein and 
Jersey cows during the transition period, when dairy 
cows are most susceptible to hypocalcemia, has not been 
established.
The objective of this study was to determine the effects 
of treatment with 5-HTP prepartum on the regulation of 
calcium homeostasis in transition dairy cows. We also 
aimed to establish any differential responses between

Holstein cows and Jersey cows to 5-HTP administration. 
We hypothesized that treatment with 5-HTP prepartum 
would positively impact calcium homeostasis postpartum, 
and thus reduce the incidence of hypocalcemia in 
Holstein and Jersey cows transitioning from pregnancy 
to lactation. Given the predisposition of Jersey cows to 
hypocalcemia, we hypothesized that treatment with 
5-HTP would induce more dramatic responses in terms 
of calcium homeostasis in Jersey cows compared with 
Holstein cows.
Materials and methods
Animals and experimental design
All of the experiments were performed under protocols 
approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at 
the University of Wisconsin-Madison (Protocol number 
A01521). The trial was conducted from May of 2014 
through March of 2015. Approximately, 3 weeks before 
their date of expected parturition, 12 multiparous Holstein 
(average lactation number 3.67 ± 0.43) and 12 multiparous 
Jersey (average lactation number 2.83 ± 0.37) dairy 
cows were transported to the Dairy Cattle Center at the 
University of Wisconsin-Madison. Holstein cows and 
Jersey cows were enrolled simultaneously. Approximately 
1 week was allowed for cows to acclimatize to the barn, 
which uses tie-stall housing. Prepartum, cows were fed a 
low-energy, high-fiber diet which relies on the fact that 
straw and corn silage are generally lower in potassium 
content, and thus help to control the dietary cation–
anion difference (DCAD) without supplemental anionic 
salt addition (Drackley & Guretzky 2007). At parturition, 
cows were switched to a diet that was formulated for 
lactating cows. Feed samples were collected weekly, and 
monthly composites were subsequently dried, ground, 
and analyzed for nutrient composition (Dairyland 
Laboratories, Arcadia, WI, USA). Ingredient and nutrient 
composition of the dry, pregnant, and lactating cow diets 
are shown in Table 1.
Approximately, 7 days before the predicted date of 
parturition, cows were weighed and subsequently infused 
daily at approximately 0800 
h with either 1 
L of saline or 
1 
L of saline containing 1 
mg/kg bodyweight of 5-HTP 
(Sigma-Aldrich). The dose of 1 
mg 5-HTP/kg bodyweight 
was based on results of a previous experiment designed 
to determine the optimum dose of 5-HTP to administer 
to dairy cows (Laporta et al. 2015). The final treatment 
groups were Holstein cows infused with saline (H CON; 
n 
= 
6), 
Holstein 
cows 
infused 
with 
saline 
+ 
5-HTP 
(H 5-HTP; n

6), Jersey cows infused with saline (J CON; 
n 
= 
6), and Jersey cows infused with saline 
+ 
5-HTP 
(J 5-HTP; n 
= 
6). The final doses of 5-HTP administered in 
grams ranged from a total of 0.75 to 0.85 
g in H 5-HTP 
and from 0.47 to 0.55 
g in J 5-HTP. Holstein cows were 
infused for 5.67 ± 0.78 days and Jersey cows were infused 
for 8.67 ± 1.53 days prepartum leading up to the day of 
parturition (P 
> 
0.05 for number of days infused between 
Holstein cows and Jersey cows). All cows were infused 
for at least 3 days with the exception of one H CON that 
was infused for 1 day and one J 5-HTP that was infused 
for 2 days. Each infusion was completed over the course 
of approximately 45 
min. Heart rate (HR), respiration 
rate (RR), and rectal temperature (RT) were recorded for 
each cow before the infusion began, every 15 
min of 
the infusion, and at the end of the infusion to monitor 
the cow health response to the infusion. Frequency of 
defecation and stool consistency (with 1 
= 
solid stool 
through 4 
= 
diarrhea) was also recorded throughout the 
infusion (Laporta et al. 2015). Cows were also weighed on 
day 7 of lactation. Blood, urine, and milk samples were 
collected daily, and daily feed intake was recorded from 
the date of enrollment approximately 2 weeks before 
parturition through 14 days into lactation and on day 
30 of lactation, while milk yield was recorded from the 
 
date of parturition through 14 days of lactation and on 
day 30 of lactation using DairyComp 305 records from 
morning and evening milkings.

Sample collection
Approximately, 7 days before the predicted parturition 
date, a jugular catheter was inserted in each cow 
(Abbocath-T Subclavian I.V. 14 
g × 5 1/2” Catheter, 
Hospira, Lake Forest, IL, USA). Catheters were placed 
under an i.v. sedative and analgesic cocktail (0.02 
mg/kg 
butorphanol, Fort Dodge Laboratories (Fort Dodge, IA, 
USA) and 0.02 
mg/kg xylazine, AnaSed (Shenandoah, IA, 
USA)). Before insertion, the surgical site was shaved and 
scrubbed with betadine surgical scrub (Veterinary Purdue 
Products, Stamford, CT, USA) and 70% ethanol. Following 
insertion, catheters were sutured to the skin, and the 
cow’s neck was wrapped with 7.6 
cm Elastikon Elastic 
Tape (Johnson & Johnson) to secure the catheters in 
place. Every 8 
h, catheters were flushed with 10 
mL sterile 
saline solution containing 10 
IU/mL heparin (Sagent 
Pharmaceuticals, Schaumburg, IL, USA).
Blood samples were collected daily before the days 
of infusion from the coccygeal vein. On infusion days, 
whole blood samples were taken from the jugular catheter 
before the infusion, immediately following infusion, and 
at 2, 4, and 8 
h postinfusion. On the day of parturition, 
the jugular catheter was removed and subsequent blood 
samples were taken from the coccygeal vein. Blood 
samples collected on the day of parturition were taken 
as close to parturition as possible, but within at least 
2 
h after parturition. To isolate the serum fraction from 
blood, 10 
mL BD Vaccutainer Serum Plus Tubes (367820, 
BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) were used. For the plasma 
fraction, blood was collected into Lithium Heparin 158 
USP Units Plus Blood Collection Tubes (367880, BD, 
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Following centrifugation at 
3000 
g for 20 
min at 4°C, the serum or plasma fractions 
were collected and stored at −80°C until analysis.
Urine samples were taken daily. Urine was obtained by 
gently massaging the area between the udder and the vulva 
and collecting mid-stream samples in 5 
mL Eppendorf 
tubes. All urine samples were stored at −20°C until analysis. 
Milk samples were collected each morning for 14 
d after 
parturition into sterile Eppendorf tubes and stored at −20°C.
Sample laboratory analyses
For all assays performed, a quality control (QC) was 
analyzed on each plate to assure the integrity of the 
assay. Serotonin concentrations were analyzed in serum 
via a Serotonin Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) Kit following 
the manufacturer’s instructions (IM1749, Immunotech, 
Beckman Coulter, Marseille Cedex, 9, France). All serum 
 
samples were diluted 1:100 in order to fit within the range 
of the assay’s standard curve. The intra- and interassay 
coefficient of variation (CV) were 7.9 and 15.3%, 
respectively. Total calcium in serum was determined using 
a colorimetric calcium assay kit (no. 700550,  
Cayman 
Chemical). The intra-assay CV for the serum calcium was 
3.9% and the interassay CV was 7.8%. Total milk calcium 
was measured using atomic absorption spectrophotometry 
(Perkin-Elmer Model 2280, Perkin-Elmer), after digestion 
with nitric and perchloric acid (4:2 
vol/vol) as described 
previously (Laporta et al. 2015). To assure accuracy, one 
milk sample in each digest was spiked with a known 
quantity of calcium and the percentage of calcium 
recovery was calculated. The average calcium recovery 
across all digests was 96.6%.
Prolactin 
was 
measured 
in 
plasma 
by 
radioimmunoassay 
as described previously by Bruckmaier and coworkers 
(1992). The intra-assay CV was 2.3% and the interassay 
was 8.4%. Deoxypyridinoline (DPD) was measured in urine 
using an enzyme immunoassay (DPD MicroVue Bone 
Health, ALPCO, Salem, NH, USA). All samples were diluted 
1:10 to fit within the standard curve. The intra-assay CV 
was 3.4% and the interassay CV was 8.8%. To account 
for urine volume, DPD concentrations were corrected for 
creatinine concentrations in the urine. Urine creatinine 
concentration was determined using a colorimetric assay per 
the manufacturer’s instructions (DICT-500, QuantiChrom 
Creatinine Assay Kit, BioAssay Systems, Hayward, CA, 
USA). For urine creatinine measurements, the intra-assay 
CV was 3.6% and the interassay CV was 8.8%.
Statistical analysis
Analysis of the data in this study was completed 
using a linear mixed model with repeated measures 
using SAS software (version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc, 
Cary, NC, USA). Prepartum and postpartum time 
periods as well as within-treatment or within-breed 
effects were analyzed separately. The model used was

with parturition as day (0). The random effect of Cow within 
treatment was considered the error term for all effects that 
did not include the day (D) effect. In order to account for 
autocorrelated errors due to repeated measurements on the 
same experimental unit, Cow(T), an ar(1) error structure 
was used within the SAS MIXED procedure. The residuals 
from the model were analyzed with a normality test,

and when the normality assumption failed, the ranks of 
the data were analyzed in a nonparametric matter. Each 
metabolite was evaluated for extreme influential data points 
and outliers, which were removed when identified. In the 
analyses of calcium and serotonin, a covariate correction 
was necessary. The covariate used was a baseline average 
of three daily blood samples taken before any treatment 
applied to the cow. When relevant, particular preplanned 
days relative to parturition were isolated and compared 
using the same model stated above. Manure severity index 
was calculated by summing the manure scores across days 
(with 1 
= 
solid stool through 4 
= 
very loose stool) and then 
analyzing the fixed effects of treatment, breed, and the 
interaction. In the reporting of HR, RR, RT, and manure 
severity and frequency, an average of 7 days of infusion 
were included in the analysis. For all analyses, differences 
between means were considered significant at P 
< 
0.05 and 
were considered a tendency when 0.05 
< 
P 
< 
0.10. All values 
are reported as LS mean ±

Results
Cow health and bodyweight were not affected by  
5-HTP infusion
In a previous study of late-lactation Holsteins, 5-HTP was 
determined to be safe for i.v. administration at 1.0 
mg/kg 
(Laporta et al. 2015). Using the same cow health parameters 
of HR, RR, and RT in the current study, 5-HTP was 
determined safe to administer to both Holstein and Jersey 
cows during the transition period. Neither treatment nor 
breed altered any cow health trait throughout the course 
of i.v. infusion of 5-HTP (P 
> 
0.05). Both Holstein and Jersey 
cows given 5-HTP produced a looser stool throughout the 
infusion period when compared with saline-infused cows 
(P 
< 
0.0001). All cows administered 5-HTP defecated more 
frequently than saline-infused cows (P 
< 
0.0001). Breed 
did not affect defecation frequency or manure severity 
index (P 
> 
0.05).
Treatment did not affect bodyweights pre- or 
postpartum in either Holstein or Jersey cows (P 
> 
0.05), 
but cows weighed less postpartum relative to prepartum 
(P 
< 
0.006) and Jerseys weighed less than Holsteins 
(P 
< 
0.0001). The average bodyweights prepartum were 
822 ± 20, 824 ± 24, 552 ± 23, and 511 ± 15 
kg for H CON, 
H 5-HTP, J CON, and J 5-HTP, respectively. The average 
bodyweights 7 days postpartum were 775 ± 22, 749 ± 37, 
508 ± 15, and 493 ± 15 
kg for H CON, H 5-HTP, J CON, and 
J 5-HTP, respectively.
Overall disease incidence was recorded throughout 
the experiment. Of the 24 cows enrolled in our study, two 
H CON, two H 5-HTP, three J CON, and two J 5-HTP cows 
were treated for ketosis. With respect to mastitis, one 
 
H CON, three H 5-HTP, four J CON, and one J 5-HTP cow 
had mastitis. One H 5-HTP cow had a retained placenta. 
Finally, two H CON, two J CON, and one J 5-HTP cow 
required i.v. calcium administration after parturition due 
to clinical symptoms of hypocalcemia.
Feed intake and milk yield are not affected by 5-HTP 
infusion postpartum
Overall, feed intake was dynamic in response to 5-HTP 
infusion in both breeds (Fig. 1A). Prepartum, H CON 
tended to eat more than H 5-HTP (P 
= 
0.06), significantly so 
on the 2 days before parturition (P 
≤ 
0.05). There was also 
a significant effect of DRP on feed intake in the Holstein 
cows before parturition (P 
< 
0.0001), but no treatment 
and time interaction (P 
> 
0.05; Fig. 1B). Postpartum, DRP 
had an effect (P 
< 
0.0001) on feed intake in Holstein cows, 
but there was no treatment effect or treatment and DRP 
interaction (P 
> 
0.05; Fig. 1C). Prepartum in Jersey cows, 
there was a treatment and time interaction (P 
= 
0.009) and 
an effect of DRP (P 
= 
0.002), with all cows eating less as 
they approached parturition and J 5-HTP cows eating less 
than J CON cows on 4 days before parturition (P 
= 
0.02). 
There was no effect of treatment alone on Jersey cows’ 
feed intake prepartum (P 
> 
0.05; Fig. 1D). Postpartum, 
Jersey cows ate more throughout the lactation (P 
< 
0.0001), 
but there was no effect of treatment and no treatment 
and DRP interaction (P 
> 
0.05; Fig. 1E). As anticipated, 
J CON cows ate less than H CON cows both prepartum 
(P 
= 
0.004) and postpartum (P 
= 
0.02), and there was an 
effect of DRP both pre- and postpartum (P 
< 
0.0001; 
Fig. 1F and G). Similarly, J 5-HTP ate less than H 5-HTP 
prepartum (P 
= 
0.009; Fig. 1H), but ate a similar amount 
postpartum (P 
> 
0.05), eating less only on days 11, 12, and 
13 of lactation (P 
≤

Infusion of 5-HTP increases circulating serotonin
Circulating serotonin concentrations were dynamic 
in response to infusion prepartum and postpartum, 
dependent on the breed and treatment (Fig. 3A). The 
baseline values for each treatment group used as a 
covariate 
were 
1076 ± 260, 
1251 ± 485, 
1224 ± 453, 
and 978 ± 489 
ng/mL for H CON, H 5-HTP, J CON, and 
 
J 5-HTP, respectively. Serotonin was elevated in H 5-HTP 
cows relative to H CON cows prepartum (P 
= 
0.01) 
and more specifically for the 5 days before parturition 
(P 
≤ 
0.04; Fig. 3B). H 5-HTP cows also had elevated 
circulating serotonin compared with H CON cows on the 
day of parturition (P 
= 
0.002) and on day 1 of lactation 
(P 
= 
0.04; Fig. 3C). Prepartum, DRP tended to have an 
effect on serotonin (P 
= 
0.08), while this effect was more

crucial for the onset of lactogenesis and does not change 
dramatically following the first few days of lactation. There 
was a marked increase in prolactin during lactogenesis and 
the characteristic decrease in prolactin concentrations 
following parturition, as described previously (Horseman 
1999). There was no treatment effect, treatment by DRP 
interaction, breed by DRP interaction, or treatment by 
breed by DRP interaction with respect to circulating 
prolactin concentrations (P

three H 5-HTP, six J CON, and four J 5-HTP had at least one 
calcium concentration below normocalcemic levels (below 
2.0 
mM) within 1 day prepartum through the critical 
48-h window postpartum. As mentioned previously, two 
H CON, two J CON, and one J 5-HTP cow required i.v. 
calcium administration after parturition due to clinical 
symptoms of hypocalcemia. Within treated cows, the nadir 
following parturition but pretreatment with i.v. calcium 
was 1.62 ± 0.21 
mM, which is approaching the diagnostic 
cutoff for clinical hypocalcemia of less than 1.4 
mM. 
The nadir for total circulating calcium concentrations in 
 
H CON, H 5-HTP, and J CON cows was on day 1 of lactation 
(1.99, 2.12, and 1.99 
mM, respectively). Interestingly, 
J 5-HTP cows reached their nadir for total circulating 
calcium concentrations 1 day before all other treatment 
groups, on the day of parturition (2.05 
mM). Prepartum, 
there was an effect of DRP on calcium concentrations in 
Holstein cows (P 
= 
0.002), with a characteristic decline 
that is typically seen at parturition (Moore et al. 2015; 
Fig. 5B). Postpartum, H 5-HTP cows tended to have 
overall higher calcium concentrations (P 
= 
0.07), with 
DRP having an effect (P 
< 
0.0001), and significantly higher 
calcium concentrations than H CON cows on the day of 
parturition (P 
= 
0.04), and on days 6, 8, 11, and 12 of 
lactation (P 
≤ 
0.03; Fig. 5C). Within Jersey cows, there was 
a treatment by DRP interaction prepartum (P 
= 
0.02), and 
an effect of DRP alone (P 
= 
0.01). In the 3 days prepartum, 
J 5-HTP cows had significantly lower circulating calcium 
concentrations than J CON cows (P 
≤ 
0.03), and this effect 
continued until the day of parturition, when J 5-HTP 
tended to have lower total calcium concentrations 
than J CON (P 
= 
0.09; Fig. 5D). Postpartum, J CON cows 
had higher calcium concentrations than J 5-HTP cows 
(P 
= 
0.04) and circulating calcium concentrations elevated 
as the lactation progressed (P 
= 
0.001; Fig. 5E).
Among saline-infused cows prepartum, DRP had an 
effect (P 
= 
0.001), and there was an interaction of breed 
with DRP, with J CON cows having higher total calcium 
than H CON cows (P 
= 
0.04; Fig. 5F). J CON cows continued 
to have higher calcium concentrations than H CON cows 
on the day of parturition (P 
= 
0.01) and on days 3 and 
13 of lactation (P 
≤ 
0.05). Additionally, although there 
was no overall breed effect or breed by DRP interaction, 
circulating total calcium levels elevated as the lactation 
progressed 
among 
saline-infused 
cows 
(P 
< 
0.0001; 
Fig. 5G). With respect to 5-HTP-infused cows, both DRP 
(P 
= 
0.05) and the interaction of DRP with breed had an 
effect on calcium concentrations prepartum (P 
= 
0.05), 
and on the 3 days immediately before parturition, 
 
H 5-HTP had higher calcium concentrations than J 5-HTP 
(P 
≤ 
0.03; Fig. 5H). Postpartum, there was an effect of 
DRP (P 
= 
0.003) and an interaction of breed with DRP 
(P 
= 
0.01) within 5-HTP cows, with H 5-HTP having higher 
calcium concentrations than J 5-HTP on day 6 through 15 
postpartum, excluding day 7 (P 
≤ 
0.05; Fig. 5I).
Infusion of 5-HTP increases milk calcium concentrations 
in Jersey cows, but not in Holstein cows
Infusion of 5-HTP elevated milk calcium concentrations 
in each breed differently over the course of lactation 
(Fig. 6A). Within Holstein cows, H CON had higher overall

Urine DPD is affected by 5-HTP treatment, and

Holsteins infused with 5-HTP had higher urine DPD

of treatment with DRP (P 
= 
0.01), but no effect of DRP 
alone (P

(P 
= 
0.05), and urine DPD concentrations elevated in 
both treatments throughout the lactation (P 
< 
0.0001; 
Fig. 7B). Similarly, in Jersey cows, J 5-HTP cows tended 
to have higher urine DPD concentrations than J CON 
cows prepartum in interaction with DRP (P 
= 
0.08), and 
DPD concentrations were dynamic over time (P

Postpartum, there was an effect of DRP on urine DPD 
concentrations (P

Discussion
During lactation, the mammary gland is predominately 
regulated in an autocrine–paracrine fashion by local 
rather than by systemic factors (Weaver & Hernandez 
2016). One major regulator of mammary gland function 
is the monoamine serotonin, which has particular 
importance for maintenance of calcium homeostasis 
in both rodents and dairy cows (Matsuda et al. 2004, 
Hernandez et al. 2012b, Laporta et al. 2014a, 2015). 
During the transition from pregnancy to lactation, 
dairy cows are susceptible to calcium-related disorders, 
specifically periparturient hypocalcemia (Goff 2008, 
DeGaris & Lean 2009). Previous work from our lab has 
demonstrated that serotonin positively regulates calcium 
homeostasis in late-lactation dairy cows (Laporta et al. 
2015). To date, however, no research has been reported on 
the role of serotonin in modulating calcium homeostasis 
in dairy cows transitioning from pregnancy to lactation. 
In addition, although Jersey cows are known to have as 
much as a 2.25× increased incidence of hypocalcemia 
(Lean et al. 2006), only limited research efforts have 
focused on the etiology of hypocalcemia in different

breeds of dairy cows. Our hypothesis in this study was 
that treatment of dairy cows with 5-HTP, the immediate 
precursor to serotonin, during the prepartum phase would 
lead to an improvement in calcium status during the 
postpartum period. Confirmation of this improvement 
in calcium status would support the use of 5-HTP as a 
therapeutic prevention strategy against the development 
of hypocalcemia. We also hypothesized that Jersey cows 
would be more responsive to 5-HTP treatment. The data 
herein demonstrate that i.v. infusion of 5-HTP in the week 
before parturition had positive effects on calcium status in 
both Jersey and Holstein cows postpartum. The benefits 
were unique to and dependent on the breed of cattle.
Although we had previously established a safe dose at 
which to administer 5-HTP to late-lactation dairy cows, 
it was unclear whether transition cows would respond 
differently, given that the weeks surrounding parturition 
are associated with reduced immune function, feed 
intake, and negative energy balance, leading to increased 
risk of metabolic disease (LeBlanc 2010). To evaluate the 
acute effects of 5-HTP administration on the health of 
peripartum cows, we monitored heart rate, respiratory 
rate, and rectal temperature throughout the course of all 
infusion periods. None of these parameters were affected 
by the 5-HTP infusion. It is well established that as much 
as 90% of serotonin is synthesized in the gut (Kim & Khan 
2014) and that exogenous administration of serotonin 
potently stimulates gastrointestinal motility (Spencer 
2015). This was evident in the frequency of defecation 
and severity of stool looseness in our cows, both of which 
were increased throughout the course of 5-HTP infusion. 
This phenomenon was not dependent on the breed of 
dairy cow. None of the cows in the current experiment 
exhibited visible signs of dehydration as a result of the 
increased bowel motility. We concluded, therefore, that 
5-HTP administration did not have an acute impact on 
transition cow health.
We next assured that 5-HTP infusion was not affecting 
crucial factors such as feed intake and milk yield, as these 
would be significant deterrents to the use of 5-HTP for 
commercial production. The characteristic decrease in 
feed intake was detected in both breeds at the time of 
parturition. Jersey cows consumed less than Holstein 
cows overall, as is typical when comparing these two 
breeds (Rastani et al. 2001). Treatment with 5-HTP tended 
to affect feed intake prepartum, which could be related 
to the increased gut motility produced as a result of the 
prepartum 5-HTP infusion. Jersey cows infused with 
5-HTP had more depressed feed intake compared with 
J CON cows than H 5-HTP cows relative to H CON cows. 
This may be attributed to the number of infusion days, 
as Jersey cows were infused for more days overall than 
Holstein cows, thereby having an accumulating effect on 
gut motility over time. However, the length of infusion 
between breeds was not significant. Additionally, it is 
unlikely that energy status was affected given that there 
was no difference in postpartum feed intake as a result of 
treatment in either breed. Holstein cows produced more 
milk than Jersey cows, again characteristic of these breeds 
(Rastani et al. 2001, Prendiville et al. 2009). Only on the day 
of parturition in Jersey cows did 5-HTP treatment result in 
decreased milk yield, with milk yield equalizing by day 
1 of lactation. Colostrum formation (colostrogenesis) 
is assumed to begin approximately 15–20 days before 
parturition (Collier et al. 2012). Colostrum quantity and 
quality are absolutely essential to calf health; therefore, 
the lack of any detrimental effects on colostrum yield 
following infusion of 5-HTP is significant. Further studies 
should be conducted to examine the impact of 5-HTP on 
the quality of colostrum.
In peripartum cows, serotonin concentrations can 
be quite variable. In a previous study performed in our 
laboratory, serotonin concentrations varied approximately 
1000 
ng/mL from the 3 days prepartum to the 3 days 
postpartum (Moore et al. 2015). In the 6 days prepartum 
in this study, serotonin concentrations were significantly 
elevated in both H 5-HTP cows relative to H CON cows, 
and J 5-HTP cows had elevated serotonin 2 days before 
parturition and on the day of parturition compared with 
J CON cows. This implies that, despite natural variability 
between individuals, 5-HTP treatment prepartum elevates 
circulating serotonin concentrations in both Holstein and 
Jersey cows. Additionally, based on prepartum circulating 
serotonin concentrations, Jersey cows apparently respond 
more gradually to treatment with 5-HTP than Holstein 
cows. This gradual increase in circulating serotonin 
corresponds to the gradual decline in circulating total 
calcium concentrations in J 5-HTP cows that occurs 
prepartum, which suggests that serotonin is stimulating 
the transient hypocalcemia necessary to liberate calcium 
from bone before parturition (Wysolmerski 2010). 
Interestingly, serotonin concentrations remained elevated 
in both breeds relative to their respective CON groups on 
the day of parturition and day 1 of lactation, and were only 
again elevated later in the lactation, beginning at around 
day 10. Finally, it is of note that Moore and coworkers 
(2015) reported a decrease in circulating serotonin levels 
on the days leading up to and immediately following 
parturition. However, our data show a different pattern in 
the 5-HTP treatment groups, as both groups had elevated

serotonin concentrations on the day of parturition. This 
is not surprising, given that in Moore and coworkers 
(2015), no treatments were applied. Furthermore, this 
suggests that 5-HTP treatment was able to maintain 
higher circulating serotonin concentrations around the 
time of parturition.
Notably, there was no difference in prolactin 
concentrations during the pre- or postpartum periods in 
either breed or in response to 5-HTP treatment. Prolactin 
is a potent lactogenic hormone in most species, but, until 
recently, there was still debate as to its importance in 
ruminants. Studies by Lacasse and coworkers (2012) have 
demonstrated that prolactin is galactopoietic in dairy 
cows, and that it is largely regulated in the local, mammary 
gland environment. At a neuronal level, administration of 
serotonin (Kamberi et al. 1971) or 5-HTP (Lu & Meites 1973) 
into the brain of rats provoked an increase in circulating 
prolactin concentrations. In the rodent mammary gland, 
prolactin activates the Janus kinase 5/signal transducer 
and activator of transcription 5 (Jak/STAT5) pathway, 
which regulates milk protein synthesis (Horseman 1999). 
When administered to a human mammary epithelial cell 
line, exogenous serotonin downregulates this pathway, 
resulting in decreased β-casein expression (Chiba et al. 
2014). Our results indicate that exogenous administration 
of 5-HTP likely does not affect circulating prolactin 
concentrations in peripartum dairy cows. Instead, it 
appears that serotonin and prolactin are functioning 
through largely independent pathways during this time 
period in the overall circulation. However, given that 
both serotonin and prolactin have known autocrine 
and paracrine actions on the mammary gland (Weaver 
& Hernandez 2016), further studies should consider 
the relationship of these hormones peripartum at the 
glandular and cellular levels.
Administration of serotonin prepartum affected 
calcium homeostasis during both pre- and postpartum 
periods, depending on the breed. Given the 54% 
incidence of subclinical hypocalcemia in multiparous 
herds (Reinhardt et al. 2011), there is still a gap in terms 
of strategies to prevent hypocalcemia. One current tactic 
is to feed anionic salts prepartum. This practice reduced 
the incidence of clinical hypocalcemia (Charbonneau 
et al. 2006), but responses were less conclusive in the 
alleviation of subclinical hypocalcemia (Moore et al. 2000, 
Ramos-Nieves et al. 2009). Cows used in this research 
experiment were fed a low-energy, high-fiber diet that 
included straw and corn silage, which are generally lower 
in potassium content than alternate feed ingredients. 
The reduced  
potassium content helps to control DCAD 
without anionic salt addition (Drackley & Guretzky 
2007). For this reason, the DCAD mineral content of 
approximately +9.9 
mEq/100 
g was not unexpected for 
the current diets. Further studies are required to evaluate 
the impact of serotonin in combination with different 
feeding strategies, particularly diets which provide a 
negative DCAD (Goff 2008, DeGaris & Lean 2009). Given 
that 5-HTP administration in this trial affected circulating 
calcium concentrations without a negative DCAD diet, 
it would be useful and interesting to see how calcium 
changes postpartum are affected by a combination of 
these two preventative strategies.
While the experiment was not designed to evaluate 
disease incidence postpartum, all health events were 
recorded. Of the 24 cows enrolled in our study, two 
 
H CON, two H 5-HTP, three J CON, and two J 5-HTP were 
treated for ketosis. With respect to mastitis, one H CON, 
three H 5-HTP, four J CON, and one J 5-HTP had mastitis. 
Only one H 5-HTP had a retained placenta. Finally, two 
 
H CON, two J CON, and one J 5-HTP required i.v. calcium 
administration after parturition due to clinical symptoms 
of hypocalcemia. Therefore, with respect to hypocalcemia, 
only 1 out of 12 5-HTP-infused cows required therapeutic 
intervention relative to 4 out of 12 of saline-infused 
cows. Clinical hypocalcemia is a debilitating disease that 
negatively impacts the cow’s welfare, as it often results 
in the cow’s inability to stand due to severe muscle 
tremors (Goff 2008). The current observation that only 
one cow treated with 5-HTP required intervention for 
clinical symptoms of hypocalcemia is consistent with the 
potential for 5-HTP as a therapeutic tool during prepartum 
periods. However, there was no marked difference in 
ketosis incidence and mastitis occurrence seemed to be 
dependent on breed, with less J 5-HTP developing mastitis 
than J CON, but more H 5-HTP developing mastitis than 
H CON. Clearly, more experiments with a greater number 
of animals need to be conducted in this area to confirm 
our findings.
Although the intent of this study was to examine the 
effect of 5-HTP administration prepartum on postpartum 
calcium homeostasis, several insights were revealed from 
the 
examination 
of 
prepartum 
total 
calcium 
concentrations 
in serum. In Jersey cows, the most striking result of 5-HTP 
administration was the more gradual decline in calcium 
concentrations prepartum. In a previous study, we had 
noted that circulating calcium concentrations decreased 
in response to acute 5-HTP infusion in late lactation 
Holstein cows (Laporta et al. 2015). On our infusion days 
immediately prepartum, circulating calcium levels did not 
appear to decline in H 5-HTP cows relative to H CON cows,

but there was a gradual decline in circulating calcium 
over the 3 days prepartum in J 5-HTP cows compared 
with all other cows. In all other treatment groups, there 
was a drop in circulating calcium concentrations, either 
on the day before or the day of parturition. Although 
they reached a similar nadir (2.05 
mM), J 5-HTP cows 
began to display a gradual decline in circulating calcium 
concentrations prepartum. This is interesting because 
it is possible that the Jersey cows treated with 5-HTP 
are initiating a transient decrease in circulating calcium 
concentrations prepartum, in order to initiate an earlier 
recovery of circulating calcium concentrations at the time 
of parturition.
In addition, as all the other treatment groups showed 
a decrease in circulating calcium concentrations over the 
first day of lactation, the J 5-HTP cows began to recover 
from their nadir within the first day postpartum. This 
recovery is significant for two reasons: (1) increasing 
circulating calcium is important to overall health, and 
(2) a transient hypocalcemia must be established to 
activate bone resorption mechanisms which release 
calcium during lactation (VanHouten et al. 2004, 
Ardeshirpour et al. 2006). Calcium is mobilized from bone 
during lactation as a result of mammary-derived PTHrP 
actions on the bone to increase osteoclastic resorption 
(Wysolmerski 2010). Serotonin is crucial to this system, 
as a stimulator of PTHrP release from the mammary 
gland. Additionally, PTHrP increases activity of mammary 
calcium pumps and transporters to transfer the resorbed 
bone calcium into milk and prevent a negative feedback 
of elevated circulating calcium from a downregulation 
of PTHrP release (Hernandez et al. 2012b, Laporta et al. 
2013a, Horseman & Hernandez 2014). The release of 
mammary PTHrP, therefore, depends on initiation 
of a transient hypocalcemia (VanHouten et al. 2004, 
Ardeshirpour et al. 2006). Our results infer that, in Jersey 
cows, 5-HTP administration potentially stimulates this 
transient hypocalcemia during the prepartum period. 
The prepartum decline stimulated by exogenous 5-HTP 
in Jersey cows induces a cascade of signaling pathways to 
increase bone resorption and calcium release for secretion 
into milk and allows an earlier recovery in postpartum 
circulating calcium concentrations relative to saline-
infused Jersey cows. Indeed, in J 5-HTP cows, there was 
numerically more calcium in milk than in J CON cows 
on the day of and day after parturition, inferring that 
5-HTP may aid in the initiation of bone resorption as a 
source of calcium for milk. In Jersey cows, we propose 
that exogenous 5-HTP  
administration provokes both 
an earlier and more gradual decline in circulating total 
calcium concentrations, as opposed to a sudden, severe 
drop in calcium concentrations of saline-treated animals 
relying solely on endogenous signals. This gradual 
adaptation and transient hypocalcemia may facilitate 
an earlier recovery in circulating calcium concentrations 
around parturition, potentially before the significant 
demand for milk production depletes circulating calcium 
stores leading to the negative cascade of events triggered 
by hypocalcemia. However, this hypothesis needs to be 
explored more thoroughly.
Given the gradual prepartum decline in total serum 
calcium, J 5-HTP cows may avoid hypocalcemia at 
parturition and more steadily regulate their calcium 
homeostasis postpartum. Compared with saline-infused 
Holstein cows, H 5-HTP cows tended to have elevated 
calcium concentrations postpartum, significantly so on 
the day of parturition. Postpartum, J 5-HTP cows had 
lower circulating calcium concentrations than J CON 
cows, but none of the 5-HTP cows had serum calcium 
concentrations below the threshold for designation of 
subclinical hypocalcemia (1.4–2.0 mM/L, Reinhardt et al. 
2011). The lower circulating calcium concentrations 
in J 5-HTP cows appear to be consistent with an 
increased movement of calcium into milk on the day 
of and the day after parturition, although the milk 
calcium concentrations become quite variable in Jersey 
cows throughout the lactation. In Holstein cows, the 
mechanism appears to be different than Jersey cows, as 
H CON cows had higher milk calcium concentrations 
than H 5-HTP cows on the day of parturition and day 1 
of lactation. Importantly, our results do not include the 
flux of calcium which also occurs in renal and intestinal 
regulation of calcium homeostasis in dairy cows (Goff 
2008). It is possible that the decreased circulating calcium 
concentrations in J 5-HTP cows compared with all other 
treatment groups may be explained by increased excretion 
of calcium or by more calcium being utilized in organs 
such as the mammary gland, intestine, and muscle.
Although renal and intestinal calcium flux was 
not evaluated in the current study, assessments were 
made on the impact of 5-HTP administration on bone 
resorption. Deoxypyridinoline is a pyridinium cross-link 
that provides structure and strength to type 1 collagen 
in bone. The cross-link peptide is released by osteoclast 
resorption of bone (Rubinacci et al. 1999). Interestingly, 
DPD concentrations have been shown to be elevated in 
primiparous cows when compared with multiparous 
cows (Kamiya et al. 2005), implying that decreased bone 
turnover activity may contribute to the higher incidence 
of hypocalcemia as cows age. The higher risk of developing

hypocalcemia in Jersey cows compared with other breeds 
is well established, but limited research efforts have 
attempted to elucidate the physiological reason for their 
predisposition (Oetzel et al. 1988, Goff et al. 1995). We 
proposed that bone resorption may play an important 
role in establishing the differences between Holstein and 
Jersey cows for calcium regulation postpartum. We further 
proposed that 5-HTP may affect bone resorption in dairy 
cows. Urine concentrations of DPD were measured as a 
marker of bone calcium resorption. A reduction in DPD 
concentrations would reflect a decrease in bone calcium 
resorption. Jersey cows had overall higher concentrations 
of DPD in their urine postpartum than Holstein cows, 
although J 5-HTP cows had similar DPD concentrations 
relative to J CON cows. One important exception to the 
elevation of DPD concentrations in Jersey cows compared 
with Holstein cows is on the day of parturition, when 
H 5-HTP cows and J 5-HTP cows have very similar DPD 
concentrations in their urine (P 
= 
0.89; 6.93 ± 0.79 vs 
6.78 ± 0.79 
nmol DPD/mmol creatinine in H 5-HTP and 
J 5-HTP, respectively), with H 5-HTP cows peaking over 
H CON cows on this day. Given the role of DPD as a 
marker of osteoclastic bone resorption (Kamiya et al. 
2005), our data imply that Jersey cows are mobilizing more 
bone than Holsteins starting on about day 3 postpartum, 
although it is important to note that we do not know the 
initial concentrations of DPD in Holstein cow versus Jersey 
cow bone. Additionally, given the spike in urine DPD 
concentrations on the day of parturition in H 5-HTP cows, 
it appears that 5-HTP infusion may provoke significant 
bone turnover at the start of lactation in Holstein cows, 
subsequently stimulating the overall elevated levels of 
circulating calcium in H 5-HTP cows relative to H CON 
cows postpartum. The missing piece of this mechanistic 
puzzle is the circulating plasma PTHrP concentration, as 
previous correlations between milk and plasma PTHrP 
and calcium in cows have been made (Onda et al. 2006, 
Moore et al. 2015). Although we attempted to evaluate our 
samples for PTHrP, we were unable to measure PTHrP in 
all the cows in our experiments, due to some cows being 
below detection limits. This prohibited us from making 
any statistical comparisons regarding this hormone in this 
particular experiment. Comparing Holstein cows to Jersey 
cows in other respects, however, provides further insights 
into the potential mechanisms behind serotonin’s role in 
the prevention of hypocalcemia.
Our data demonstrate the stark contrast in the 
regulation of calcium between Jersey cows and Holstein 
cows. Postpartum, J 5-HTP cows had numerically lower 
 
circulating calcium concentrations than J CON cows, 
but no differences were detected in urine DPD levels, 
and milk calcium concentrations were quite variable. 
Furthermore, calcium concentrations were above the 
threshold for subclinical hypocalcemia, regardless of 
treatment. Importantly, by day 30 of lactation, blood 
calcium concentrations were similar between J CON 
cows and J 5-HTP cows, and milk calcium was elevated 
in J 5-HTP cows relative to J CON cows, suggesting that 
the prepartum transient hypocalcemia and subsequent 
postpartum low blood calcium levels in response to 
serotonin may support a more stable calcium axis further 
along in lactation. By contrast, on the day of parturition, 
H 5-HTP cows had higher DPD concentrations in their 
urine and higher circulating calcium than H CON cows 
throughout lactation, inferring increased bone turnover. 
The lower circulating calcium in H CON cows compared 
with H 5-HTP cows may be explained by the high 
concentrations of calcium in milk in the H CON cows on 
the day of parturition and day 1 of lactation, suggesting 
that 5-HTP may not be stimulating movement of 
calcium into milk in the Holsteins, but the calcium may 
be used for a variety of other intracellular or homeostatic 
processes. Also noteworthy was the observation that 
H CON cows had higher milk calcium concentrations 
than J CON cows for the first few days of lactation, but 
this breed difference disappeared with addition of the 
5-HTP, as the H 5-HTP cows had lower milk calcium than 
J 5-HTP cows. Although it has previously been reported 
that Jersey cows had approximately 36% higher milk 
calcium than Holstein cows (Czerniewicz et al. 2006), 
this was not evident in our experiment until later in the 
lactation, when it appears that J CON and J 5-HTP begin 
to secrete more calcium in milk than their Holstein 
counterparts. Importantly, Czerniewicz and coworkers 
(2006) evaluated milk samples over a 6-month period, 
whereas our data were collected over a much more 
limited time of only 2 weeks postpartum. Our data 
implies that, although 5-HTP stimulated increased 
bone turnover on the day of parturition, H 5-HTP 
cows did not secrete as much calcium into their milk 
as J 5-HTP cows. Apparently, the H 5-HTP cows instead 
conserved calcium in their circulation as evidenced by 
their elevated serum calcium levels. By contrast, H CON 
cows had significantly higher amounts of calcium in 
their milk relative to J CON cows, and had lower blood 
calcium levels postpartum.
Taken together, this evidence demonstrates that 
Jersey and Holstein cows reflect different postpartum 
calcium axes, but both respond dynamically to 5-HTP 
administration prepartum. Overall, elevation of

serotonin levels prepartum by 5-HTP administration 
induced a transient hypocalcemia prepartum in the J 5-HTP 
cows that resulted in more bone turnover than in the 
 
H 5-HTP cows, with the exception of the day of parturition, 
emphasizing the breed-dependent effects of 5-HTP on 
bone mobilization. More milk calcium was detected in 
milk from J 5-HTP cows than J CON cows on the days 
immediately after parturition, although only numerically 
so. By contrast, 5-HTP treatment in Holstein cows 
appeared to increase circulating calcium concentrations 
postpartum and increase urine DPD concentrations 
at parturition, although saline-infused Holstein cows 
have increased milk calcium concentrations. We predict 
that J 5-HTP cows would have higher circulating PTHrP 
concentrations than H 5-HTP cows as well, as PTHrP is 
responsible for stimulating bone turnover in response to a 
transient hypocalcemia during lactation. In summary, we 
propose that treatment of dairy cows with 5-HTP during 
the prepartum period may provide benefits for postpartum 
calcium homeostasis in both Jersey and Holstein cows, 
although through different mechanisms. Further studies 
focused on hypocalcemia should pay particular attention 
to the breed, as our data demonstrate that even untreated 
Jerseys and Holstein cows have dramatically different 
mechanisms of calcium homeostasis around the time 
of parturition. We can state confidently, however, that 
5-HTP warrants further investigation as a preventative 
strategy for the prevention of subclinical and clinical 
hypocalcemia in dairy cows.
