Abstract
Due to improved health care, diet and
infrastructure in developed countries, since 1840 life
expectancy has increased by approximately 2 years
per decade. Accordingly, by 2050, a quarter of
Europe’s population will be over 65 years, represent-
ing a 10 % rise in half a century. With this rapid rise
comes an increased prevalence of diseases of ageing
and associated healthcare expenditure. To address the
health consequences of global ageing, research in
model systems (worms, flies and mice) has indicated
that reducing the rate of organ growth, via reductions
in protein synthetic rates, has multi-organ health
benefits that collectively lead to improvements in
lifespan. In contrast, human pre-clinical, clinical and
large cohort prospective studies demonstrate that
ageing leads to anabolic (i.e. growth) impairments in
skeletal muscle, which in turn leads to reductions in
muscle mass and strength, factors directly associated
with mortality rates in the elderly. As such, increasing
muscle protein synthesis via exercise or protein-based
nutrition maintains a strong, healthy muscle mass,
which in turn leads to improved health, independence
and functionality. The aim of this review is to critique
current literature relating to the maintenance of muscle
mass across lifespan and discuss whether maintaining
or reducing protein synthesis is the most logical
approach to support musculoskeletal function and by
extension healthy human ageing.

Introduction
The percentage of the global population above 65, 85
and 100 years is predicted to increase by 188, 551 and
1004 % respectively by 2050 (The United Nations;
World Population Prospects: http://esa.un.org/unpd/
wpp/). As a consequence, globally, there is a
notable increase in the prevalence of ‘diseases of
ageing’, such as sarcopenia, recently been defined by
the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older
People (EWGSOP) as a ‘syndrome characterised by
progressive and generalised loss of skeletal muscle
mass and strength with the risk of adverse outcomes
such as physical disability, poor quality of life and
death’ (Baumgartner et al. 1998; Cruz-Jentoft et al.
2010; Rosenberg 1989). This onset of sarcopenia is

 fundamentally important for health as skeletal muscle
in a healthy adult accounts for approximately 40 % of
total body mass (Janssen et al. 2000). In addition to its
primary tasks of maintaining posture, breathing and
locomotion,
skeletal
muscle
also
represents
an
important nutrient store and metabolic regulator
(Wolfe 2006). During ageing, approximately 30 % of
an individual’s peak muscle mass is lost by the age of
80, and this loss is exacerbated by physical inactivity
and poor nutrition (Janssen et al. 2000; Topinkova
2008). This decline in skeletal muscle metabolism and
function should not be underestimated, as in the UK
alone, complications arising from falls in the elderly
(with an association to frailty) are estimated to cost the
National Health Service £1.7 billion annually (www.
ageuk.org.uk).
The effect of ageing on human health
Ageing is characterized by widespread reduction in
the reserve capacity of the body’s major organs
(Topinkova 2008). Of critical importance for lifespan
is the reduction in cardiac output (Lambert and Evans
2005), which together with reduced lung function
(Taylor and Johnson 2010), decreased skeletal muscle
oxidative capacity (Betik and Hepple 2008), and
changes in body composition (Kuk et al. 2009)
ultimately lead to a reduction in maximum oxygen
consumption (VO2max) (approximately 1 % decline
per year post 25 years) (Lambert and Evans 2005).
VO2max (or surrogate measures of VO2max) correlate
highly with mortality risk (Lee et al. 1999; Lee et al.
2010; Lee et al. 2011). These metabolic changes lead
to a redistribution of nutrients, causing inappropriate
fat deposition, which has been linked with systemic
age related insulin resistance (Wolfe 2006).
Musculoskeletal deterioration in old age has severe
health consequences. Skeletal muscle and the extra-
cellular matrix of skeletal tendon-bone are essential
for maintaining tissue structure and vital for muscular
contraction and force transmission. Given the close
link between muscle loss (sarcopenia) and bone loss
(osteopenia), factors that affect muscle anabolism are
also likely to effect bone mass. With advancing age,
sarcopenia and osteopenia present major clinical
problems, such as impaired locomotory function,
compromised balance, increased risk of osteoarthritis
and fall/fractures; all of which diminish quality of life
in seniors (Cruz-Jentoft et al. 2010; Janssen et al.
2002; Landi et al. 2012a, b; Panel on Prevention of
Falls in Older Persons and British Geriatrics 2011).
Even in conditions of ‘healthy’ ageing, there is a
progressive decline in skeletal muscle quality as
described by various changes in structure, mechanics
and function. Lexell (1995) observed that males aged
15–83 years displayed an age-related reduction in
muscle cross sectional area progressing after 25 years
(Fig. 1a). This was primarily caused by a loss in the
number of fibres but also a reduction in relative cross-
sectional area, particularly of type II fibres (Fig. 1b).
The loss in fibre number and preferential loss in type II
fibres may be related to changes in innervation, as with
increasing age comes a loss of innervation of muscle
fibres and a progressive loss of alpha-motorneurons
(Brown 1972; Tomlinson and Irving 1977; Einsiedel
and Luff 1992). Following the loss of alpha motorneu-
rons, muscle fibres may become reinnervated by
surrounding neurones in a cycle of denervation and
reinnervation via collateral reinnervation (Holloszy
and Larsson 1995) which likely contributes to the loss
of strength and muscle mass with age (Luff 1998).
With less motor neurones, the number of muscle fibres
per motor unit increases, resulting in larger, less
differentiated motor units (Andersen 2003). The
preferential loss in type II fibre cross-sectional area
may partly explain why age-associated losses in
muscle strength and power occur at a greater and
disproportionate rate to losses in muscle mass (Ma-
caluso and De Vito 2004) and why aged muscle tends
to show exacerbated fatigue resistance (Avin and Law
2011). As well as the above, numerous other factors
including a reduction in number of satellite cells (Kadi
et al. 2004), a potential shift towards slow myosin
isoforms (Gelfi et al. 2006) and shortening of
sarcomere length (Narici et al. 2003) have all be
suggested to contribute to a reduction in force
generating capacity of muscle tissue with ageing. It
is extremely concerning that due to a loss of muscle
strength with age, 16–18 % of women and 8–10 % of
men over aged 65 cannot lift a 10 lb weight or kneel
down (FIFoA-R 2008). This loss of muscle strength
with ageing is known as dynapenia (Clark and Manini
2008), occurring 2–5 times faster rate than losses of
muscle mass (Clark et al. 2006; Delmonico et al.
2009). The Health, Ageing and Body Composition
study found that even gaining muscle mass with
ageing
does not entirely prevent ageing-related

 decreases in muscle strength (Delmonico et al. 2009).
Infiltration of fat, and neural alterations are likely
contributing factors, as well as changes in contractile
properties (Kent-Braun et al. 2000), and many other
mechanisms discussed elsewhere (Clark and Manini
2012; Mitchell et al. 2012). Dynapenia is a major risk
factor for loss of dependence and mobility issues
(Manini et al. 2007; Visser et al. 2005) as well as
mortality (Newman et al. 2006; Takata et al. 2012).
Coupled to the loss of force generating capacity,
there is a clear reduction of total muscle mass, at a rate
of *4.7 % peak mass/decade in men and *3.7 %
peak mass/decade in women (Mitchell et al. 2012).
Graphical representation of this change in muscle size
and composition with age is illustrated in Fig. 1c–e
(Breen et al. unpublished data). Image 1c shows an
MRI scan from a young lean male, in contrast to an
age-inactive (1D) and age-matched active individual
(1E), with similar levels of dietary protein intake
[*0.9 g/(kg/body mass)]. Evident is the reduction in
muscle mass with age (1C vs. 1D), the greater
abundance and infiltration of fat around the muscle
tissue (1C vs. 1D) and also the protective effect that
maintained physical activity appears to have on
skeletal muscle with ageing (1D vs. 1E). The
accumulation of intramuscular fat may also be a key
factor in the progressive mismatch between losses in
mass
and
strength.

 accumulates with age, producing numerous pro-
inflammatory cytokines (adipokines) into the circula-
tion which may accelerate muscle catabolism and
contribute to a vicious cycle of muscle loss and fat
accumulation (Schrager et al. 2007; Wellen and
Hotamisligil 2003). Macrophage infiltration into the
muscle as a result of increased lipid accumulation/
adipokine has been termed ‘sarcopenic obesity’
(Baumgartner 2000; Stenholm et al. 2008). The
combination of lipotoxocity and inactivity/ageing
has been proposed to reduce skeletal muscle anabolic
responses to resistance exercise and nutrition (Murton
et al. 2015; Nilsson et al. 2013; Sitnick et al. 2009;
Stephens et al. 2015). Figure 1e illustrates the preser-
vation of muscle mass and reduced fat infiltration from
a 66-year-old male age matched to Fig. 1d. The only
major difference found between individuals from 1D
and 1E is the habitual physical activity levels, with 1E
*4 times more active than 1D. Therefore, physical
activity levels (coupled with good dietary practice)
can maintain muscle mass and also strength in old age.
The importance of skeletal muscle strength
for healthy ageing
Ruiz et al. (2008) and coworkers carried out the most
comprehensive study of its kind with over 8000
participants followed for approximately 18 years to
assess the influence of muscle strength and cardiores-
piratory fitness on healthy ageing (Ruiz et al. 2008).
Subjects underwent a rigorous set of strength tests and
were stratified by strength (Fig. 2a–b). Remarkably,
individuals over the age of 60 years, classified in the
lowest third for strength, were 50 % more likely to die
of all cause mortality (Fig. 2a) than individuals in the
upper third for strength (Ruiz et al. 2008). The same
trend also applied when considering deaths associated
with cancer (Fig. 2b), indicating that muscle strength,
albeit correlative, has a protective effect from the
incidence of cancer. A final key observation of this
dataset was that regardless of strength, individuals
with higher cardio-respiratory fitness had a greater life
expectancy than low cardio-respiratory fitness coun-
terparts (Fig. 2c). Collectively, this landmark study
provided the first direct evidence that physical strength
or the processes of developing strength is intrinsically
linked to healthy ageing.
Muscle strength and VO2max are likely great
predictors for life span because they integrate both
the neuromuscular and cardiovascular systems and as
such indicate the health and functional integration of
these tissues. As we have discussed, one of the key
determinants of health span is muscle strength (and
likely muscle mass), and one of the major key
determinants of muscle mass retention is the ability
to modify muscle protein synthesis in response to
anabolic stimuli. Given the clear benefits of muscle
strength and cardiovascular fitness on healthy ageing,
the obvious question is what approaches can be taken
to preserve muscle mass, strength and function across
lifespan?
Fig. 2 Skeletal muscle strength and cardiorespiratory fitness is
associated with healthy ageing. Over the age of 60 years, all
cause (a) and cancer-associated (b) mortality is twice as likely in
individuals with low compared to high skeletal muscle strength.
In addition, irrespective of strength, low cardio-respiratory
fitness is associated with * twice the incidence of all cause
mortality (c). Adapted from (Ruiz et al. 2008)

 How is muscle mass, strength and function
regulated at the molecular level?
The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a
highly conserved serine/threonine kinase protein
complex, identified as a central regulator of cellular
growth (Fingar and Blenis 2004). Importantly, mTOR
exists as 1 of 2 complexes and hyper-activity of the
mTOR complexes 1 and 2 (mTORC1/2) has been
implicated in tumor progression, pathological hyper-
trophy, diabetes and obesity (Lee et al. 2007; Sharp
and Richardson 2011; Zoncu et al. 2011). mTORC1
and mTORC2 are very similar protein complexes
differing in a few key subunits which alters kinase
substrate preference. mTORC1 is the kinase compo-
nent of both complexes and is a member of the
phosphatidylinositol kinase (PIK) related kinases
(Abraham 1996), although it does not possess lipid
kinase activity (Brunn et al. 1997). The activity and
substrate preference of mTOR is dependent upon
several adapter proteins GbL (Kim et al. 2003), raptor
(Hara et al. 2002), rictor (Sarbassov et al. 2004), Sin1
(Yang et al. 2006) and Protor/PRR5 (Pearce et al.
2007; Woo et al. 2007), which form two separate
mTOR complexes capable of regulating distinctive
pathways. The mTOR complex 1 contains GbL, raptor
and mTOR and is rapamycin sensitive. GbL functions
to stabilize the association between mTORC1 and
raptor and enhances the kinase activity of mTORC1
towards its targets (Guertin et al. 2006), however is not
essential for mTORC1 activity (Guertin et al. 2006).
Raptor is an adapter protein that identifies and binds
substrates that contain TOS (TOR signalling) motifs
(Schalm et al. 2003) such as 4EBP and S6K1 (Schalm
and Blenis 2002). mTORC2 on the other hand consists
of mTOR, rictor, GbL, Sin1 and Protor/PRR5 and is
rapamycin insensitive (Sarbassov et al. 2004).
mTORC1 regulates protein synthesis initiation by
controlling the formation of the eIF4F complex
(Gingras et al. 2004) and governs the pioneer round
of mRNA translation by acting on SKAR via its
putative target S6K1 (Ma et al. 2008). In addition,
mTORC1 controls ribosomal biogenesis by regulating
rDNA transcription in a manner dependant upon UBF
(Hannan et al. 2003), and nuclear RNA export by
regulating eIF4E in a manner dependant upon 4EBP1
phosphorylation (Culjkovic et al. 2005; Topisirovic
et al. 2003; Topisirovic et al. 2004). In these roles
mTORC1 is a critical regulator of protein synthesis
and cell size (Fingar et al. 2002). It is well established
that resistance exercise and provision of dietary
protein activate mTORC1 synergistically, with the
post exercise/post prandial activation of mTORC1
associated with increases in net protein synthesis in
skeletal muscle (Brook et al. 2015).
The importance of exercise in the maintenance
of muscle mass and function
There is increasing evidence that the trajectory of
sarcopenia and muscle loss is highly dependent on
physical activity levels (Kortebein et al. 2008).
Chronic sedentary behaviour and physical inactivity
are key mechanistic drivers of sarcopenia, and can
accelerate loss of muscle mass and strength leading to
impaired mobility, higher risk of falls and increased
mortality
(Montero-Fernandez
and
Serra-Rexach
2013). Even acute bouts of inactivity such as 10 days
of bed rest in older adults can substantially reduce
lower leg strength, reduce aerobic capacity by 12 %
and lead to a 7 % reduction of physical activity after
the bed rest programme (Kortebein et al. 2008).
Pharmacological interventions aimed to slow the
progression of, or reverse sarcopenia, have been
generally unsuccessful (Borst 2004; Onder et al.
2009). Clear and effective lifestyle-based counter-
measures are therefore needed.
Repeated resistance exercise results in muscle
protein accretion (i.e. hypertrophy) through chroni-
cally elevated rates of synthesis that exceed that rate of
breakdown (Brook et al. 2015; Wilkinson et al. 2014).
However, the sarcopenic elderly demonstrate an age-
related anabolic resistance to exercise and protein
ingestion (Cuthbertson et al. 2005; Kumar et al. 2009).
Despite this anabolic resistance, the cumulative effects
of chronic training with appropriate protein intake can
promote muscle repair, muscle preservation and
muscle growth in the elderly if a sufficient stimulus
is maintained (Walker et al. 2011). In support of this,
numerous studies have shown the beneficial effects of
exercise in elderly individuals (Hakkinen et al. 1998)
and even those aged[
90 years (Fiatarone et al. 1994).
Benefits include increased satellite cell content (Leen-
ders et al. 2013) increased muscle cross-sectional area
and myofiber differentiation (Kosek et al. 2006),
increased muscle fibre size particularly in type II
muscle fibers (Leenders et al. 2013) and greater
muscle size and strength (Candow et al. 2006;
Biogerontology (2016) 17:497–510
501
123
 Geirsdottir et al. 2012a). These are accompanied by
metabolic adaptations such as increased metabolic rate
(Hakkinen et al. 1998) mitochondrial biogenesis and
efficiency of substrate metabolism (Holloszy and
Coyle 1984???), and exercise capacity (McCartney
et al. 1995). Long-term resistance training increases
fibre dimension (Narici et al. 1996) strength and
muscle function (Macaluso and De Vito 2004).
Importantly, resistance exercise is also safe for use
within the healthy elderly and possibly even in those
with adverse cardiovascular signs or complications
(Williams et al. 2007). In addition, resistance training
has been observed to effectively improve balance (Orr
et al. 2008) and in turn reduced fear of and occurrence
of falling (Rubenstein et al. 2000), improve cognitive
function (Cassilhas et al. 2007), decrease sit to stand
time (Leenders et al. 2013), reduce risk of repeat and
single hospitalisations (Lang et al. 2010) increase gait
speed (Studenski et al. 2011) and most importantly
improve overall quality of life (Geirsdottir et al.
2012b; Levinger et al. 2009). In addition, there is also
growing evidence that the use of regular aerobic
exercise can preserve muscle mass and function with
age (Harber et al. 2009) a point we discuss in more
detail in our recent review (Brook et al. 2015).
The importance of dietary protein
in the maintenance of muscle mass and function
Dietary protein is an essential macronutrient for the
maintenance of muscle mass and function and, by
close association, bone strength and density. The
current recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for
protein intake to meet whole-body metabolic demands
is 0.8 g/(kg/day) (0.32/kg/LBM/day if assuming LBM
accounts for 40 % of total body mass Janssen et al.
2000). However, the RDA does not distinguish
between potential differences in the amount of protein
required to maintain musculoskeletal health between
young and older individuals. Given strong evidence
that protein intakes greater than the current RDA are
associated with multiple improved musculoskeletal
health outcomes (Morley et al. 2010), it has been
postulated that protein intakes should be defined in
amounts that are ‘optimal’ to promote muscle/bone
protein accretion, or at the very least, maintenance in
old age.
Maintenance of musculoskeletal mass is dependent
on nutrient-induced stimulation of muscle protein
synthesis and the concomitant suppression of muscle
protein breakdown to promote net protein accretion,
which counters protein loss in the postabsorptive state.
Protein-based
nutrition
robustly
stimulates
MPS
through constituent essential amino acids (Chesley
et al. 1992; Tipton et al. 1999). In particular, the
branched-chain amino acid, leucine, displays potent
muscle anabolic properties, and is capable of stimu-
lating MPS and associated mTOR-mediated signaling
in the absence of, and to a greater extent than, the other
essential amino acids (Atherton et al. 2010; Wilkinson
et al. 2013). The anabolic response of muscle to amino
acid provision is relatively short lived, peaking
at *2 h after protein ingestion, returning to post-
absorptive values by *3 h after protein ingestion
(Burd et al. 2010; Mitchell et al. 2015), even
in situations where circulating amino acids remain
elevated (Bohe
´ et al. 2001).
A number of studies demonstrate that the muscle
protein synthetic response to oral protein ingestion or
essential amino acid infusion (to bypass potential age-
related differences in splanchnic extraction) is mark-
edly lower in the old compared with the young
(Cuthbertson et al. 2005; Guillet et al. 2004; Katsanos
et al. 2005; Volpi et al. 2000). However, it is important
to note that not all studies have been able to detect the
presence of age-related muscle anabolic resistance to
protein-based nutrition (Paddon-Jones et al. 2004;
Pennings et al. 2011), perhaps due to differences in the
methods used for assessment of MPS between studies
(Burd et al. 2012). Mechanisms beyond the intramus-
cular level may also underpin the compromised
muscle anabolic response to protein nutrition in older
individuals. In this regard, it has been demonstrated
that ageing is associated with greater splanchnic
extraction of amino acids, thereby reducing the
appearance of dietary protein (Volpi et al. 1999).
Beyond this, others report that microvascular perfu-
sion following nutrient provision is impaired in older
individuals (Mitchell et al. 2013), which in theory may
limit the capacity for EAA delivery and uptake into
muscle.
A recently published study shed important light on
the debate of whether ‘anabolic resistance’ resides in
old age, Moore et al. (2015) and colleagues performed
a retrospective analysis of studies from a large cohort
of young and old individuals in which MPS was
measured following ingestion of varying amounts of
high quality protein. The authors demonstrated that the
502
Biogerontology (2016) 17:497–510
123
 minimal amount of protein required to reach a
maximal MPS response was 0.25 g/kg/lean body mass
(LBM) in young individuals and 0.61 g/kg/LBM in
the old, thus highlighting the older individuals are less
sensitive to low protein intakes, and therefore have a
greater relative protein requirement than the young
(Fig. 3). These data are all the more concerning when
one considers that many older individuals do not meet
the current RDA for protein due to factors including
anorexia, appetite loss, blunted olfactory perception,
gastrointestinal issues and, in some cases, socio-
economic factors. On top of these concerning issues,
many older individuals consume dietary protein in a
skewed pattern (Tieland et al. 2012). For example,
protein intake at breakfast and lunch is often sub-
optimal to maximally stimulate MPS (
\
0.61 g/kg/
LBM), a response that may only be achieved when
large-dose protein is consumed with dinner (Tieland
et al. 2012). Collectively, these data have led to
suggestions that protein intake should perhaps be
distributed evenly across each meal.
The presence of muscle anabolic resistance in old
age has led to calls for the protein RDA to be increased
in this population in order to maximally stimulate
MPS and, perhaps, alleviate the progression of
sarcopenia. Considering the data presented by Moore
et al. (2015), a 70 year old individual weighing 80 kg
(assuming LBM accounts for 30 % of total body mass
(i.e. 24 kg) and three square meals per day (Short and
Nair 2000)) would need to consume *147 g of
protein per day or *1.8 g/kg, more than twice the
current RDA. In support of this hypothetical scenario,
Kim et al. (2015) recently demonstrated that consum-
ing 1.5 g/(kg/body mass) of protein [almost double the
current RDA—0.8 g/(kg/body mass)] resulted in
markedly greater stimulation of MPS over 24 h
compared with 0.8 g/(kg/body mass) of protein. In
this study, no added muscle anabolic benefit was
reported when protein was ingested evenly as com-
pared with skewed distribution (Kim et al. 2015).
Beyond acute studies of MPS, long-term investiga-
tions also lend weight to the suggestion that the current
RDA for protein is inadequate to meet the metabolic
needs of older individuals. For example, Campbell
et al. (2001) demonstrated that older individuals
consuming
the
recommended
protein
RDA
for
14 weeks experienced a significant loss in mid-thigh
muscle area. In addition, data from the Health ABC
study highlighted that older individuals in the highest
quintile for protein intake (*19 % of total energy
intake) lost *40 % less lean mass than did those in
the lowest quintile for protein intake (*11 % of total
energy intake) (Anderson et al. 2011).
It is clear that many older individuals do not
consume sufficient protein to maintain whole-body
and tissue-specific metabolic health, a situation that
is worsened during periods of ill health and disabil-
ity (Covinsky et al. 1999). Malnourishment during
acute and chronic disease slows the rate of recovery,
increases the risk of complications and re-admittance
to hospital (Covinsky et al. 1999). Musculoskeletal
unloading during illness and hospitalization occurs
with greater frequency in older individuals and has
dire consequences for musculoskeletal health. For
example, it has been demonstrated that 7 days of bed
rest induces muscle atrophy and anabolic resistance
in
older
individuals
(Drummond
et
al.
2012).
Furthermore, we observed a similar loss in muscle
Fig. 3 Ageing is associated with a blunted anabolic response to
protein ingestion in humans. Comparative analysis indicates that
the protein dose required to maximally stimulate myofibrillar
fractional protein synthesis rates in young individuals (a) is
40 % lower than in old individuals (b). Data adapted from

 mass and anabolic sensitivity in older individuals
following 14 days of reduced ambulation (Breen
et al. 2013). In addition to skeletal muscle defects,
disuse
events
are
also
accompanied
by
severe
osteopenia. Thus, deterioration in muscle anabolic
responsiveness and bone properties during consecu-
tive disuse events in old age may accumulate and
drive the progression of sarcopenia and osteopenia.
A general consensus gathering momentum is that
high protein intakes (greater than the current RDA)
are required during illness and hospitalization to
maintain musculoskeletal health and quicken the rate
of recovery (Cawood et al. 2012). This point is
reinforced by evidence that
muscle
wasting
is
evident during disuse even with protein intakes of
1.0–1.2 g/(kg/body mass) (Trappe et al. 2007). From
a clinical perspective, one study also reported that
the sickest older hospital patients are the most
protein malnourished (Pichard et al. 2004). Beyond
skeletal muscle health, in osteoporosis there is
evidence that higher bone mineral density is evident
when protein intake exceeds the current
RDA
(Devine et al. 2005; Meng et al. 2009). Further, in
hip fracture patients, supplemental or higher protein
intakes (greater than the current RDA) are associated
with increased bone density and a reduction in
recovery time (Schurch et al. 1998). The notion that
higher dietary protein intakes (particularly those
high in sulphur-containing amino acids) may lead to
blood acidification, calcium resorption from bones
and osteoporosis (the so called ‘acid-ash hypothesis)
has been roundly disregarded in several meta-
analyses (Fenton et al. 2008; Fenton et al. 2010;
Fenton et al. 2009a; Fenton et al. 2009b). Specifi-
cally, it is clear that the available evidence does not
support a causal association between dietary acid
load and osteoporotic bone disease. To summarize,
there is a clear need for dietary protein intake above
the current RDA in older individuals to maintain
musculoskeletal health and quality of life, with
experts
recommending
between
1.0
and
1.2 g/
(kg body mass) for healthy older individuals (Bauer
et al. 2013). Moreover, this need is likely to be
increased
further
during
periods
where
muscu-
loskeletal mass is compromised, such as illness and
hospitalization, with experts recommending between
1.2 and 2.0 g/(kg/body mass) in such situations
(dependent on the severity of illness and extent of
malnutrition) (Bauer et al. 2013).
Should research focus be on improving lifespan
or healthspan?
Based on the data discussed above, it seems clear that
skeletal muscle mass and strength is vital for healthy
ageing, and that exercise and dietary protein are key
mediators of mTORC1-accociated increases in skele-
tal muscle protein synthesis. However, there is a large
body of evidence in model organisms suggesting that
strategies that blunt protein synthesis (mTORC1
inhibition, calorie restriction) increase lifespan and
as such show promise as longevity promoting thera-
pies (Kapahi et al. 2010).
For example, the mTORC1 inhibitor Rapamycin
increases lifespan in a variety of models including
yeast (Kaeberlein et al. 2005), c. elegans (Jia et al.
2004) and Drosophila Melanogaster (Kapahi et al.
2004). In mice, Rapamycin increases lifespan at 90 %
mortality by 14 % for males and 9 % for females
respectively, with survival increasing regardless of
late-life (600 days of age) or mid-life (270 days of
age) administration (Harrison et al. 2009). Consistent
with the notion that reducing protein synthesis can
increase lifespan, individually knocking out eIF4G
and S6K1 (Selman et al. 2009) improves longevity in
model organisms whilst individuals with mutations
leading to low insulin like growth factor1 (IGF1) and
insulin levels, key drivers of mTORC1 activity and
protein synthesis during development, have reduced
rates of cancer and diabetes (Guevara-Aguirre et al.
2011; Shevah and Laron 2007). Additionally, the
offspring of centenarians (who have a delayed risk of
developing certain diseases and an increased longevity
against age matched controls) have low circulating
IGF1 bioactivity (Vitale et al. 2012).
Some of the nuances in these various models/
studies have recently been expertly reviewed else-
where (Sharples et al. 2015), and what is clearly
apparent is that few studies have taken into account
muscle strength, size and functional capacity when
considering improvements in lifespan. As such, the
physiological context (i.e. healthspan vs lifespan) of
living longer in these models is often overlooked. Two
key studies from Blake Rasmussen’s lab; Dickinson
et al. (2011) and Drummond et al. (2009) have
experimentally tested the direct effect of rapamycin in
human skeletal muscle (Fig. 4). First, Drummond
et al. (2009), demonstrated that pretreatment of human
subjects with rapamycin completely blocked the
504
Biogerontology (2016) 17:497–510
123
 ability of resistance exercise to increase muscle
protein synthesis (Fig. 4a) confirming previous reports
in rat skeletal muscle (Kubica et al. 2005). Second,
Dickinson et al. (2011), demonstrates that rapamycin
could completely block the muscle protein synthetic
response to essential amino acids (Fig. 4b). Whilst no
studies have examined the long-term effects of
rapamycin treatment on skeletal muscle in humans,
mice on chronic rapamycin supplementation display
reduced myofibrillar protein synthesis (Drake et al.
2013) and loose the ability to accrue muscle mass
following synergist ablation (Bodine et al. 2001). So
effectively, rapamycin is inducing anabolic resistance
in young, healthy individuals. Therefore rapamycin
treatment in old individuals, already displaying
anabolic resistance and frailty appears to be a ques-
tionable therapeutic approach to improve healthspan.
With regard to calorie restriction, it also seems clear
that the severity of calorie restriction employed and
the macronutrient content administered has a dramatic
effect on the preservation or loss of muscle mass
(Cerqueira and Kowaltowski 2010). For example,
there is some evidence that supplementing protein
during periods of negative energy balance can pre-
serve muscle mass in healthy human volunteers,
compared to energy restriction alone (Josse et al.
2011; Mettler et al. 2010; Phillips 2014). Therefore, it
would appear that future research into the macronu-
trient content of calorie restricted diets, in combina-
tion with greater understanding of skeletal muscle
function is an important future direction for calorie
restriction research.
A final point of consideration is that longevity
studies in rodents are conducted in thermo-neutral,
pathogen free environments, in conditions where food
and water are abundant. Rodents are not required to
forage for food and compete with littermates for
survival (both processes that require functional skele-
tal muscle). In fact a recent report suggests that mice
housed in such conditions have poor health and
functional capacity (Martin et al. 2010). In such
situations, loss of muscle mass and physiological
function is not a detrimental factor. Collectively, this
therefore raises the important question as to what we
are striving for in this area of biogerontology? Are we
looking to increase lifespan at a compromise of health-
span, or would we rather live a healthy active life that
encompasses maintenance of muscle mass, strength
and function?
Live strong and prosper
If we return to the data from Ruiz et al. (2008), this
would suggest that maintaining physical strength is a
key strategy that leads to healthy ageing. Couple this
with the numerous pre-clinical and clinical human
studies we have discussed, and it seems clear that an
active lifestyle supported by appropriate dietary
protein is the key to maintaining strong, healthy
skeletal muscle. In this context, the importance of
muscle size and strength for longevity and health in
humans puts a new spin on the Darwinian statement
‘‘Survival of the Fittest’’ as it is clear that the strongest,
fittest individuals are more likely to live longer and
healthier lives (Artero et al. 2011; Artero et al.;
Haskell et al. 2007; Ruiz et al. 2009; Ruiz et al. 2008).
Given the highlighted importance of muscle function
for healthspan, it is hoped that all future age-related

 research will consider skeletal muscle during exper-
imental interventions and strive to use readouts of
function as the principal outputs as opposed to isolated
gene or protein analysis. Finally, and perhaps most
importantly, when it comes to fully understanding the
complexities of human ageing, it is clear that the only
way to really achieve clarity is through integrative
studies, from basic model systems through to compli-
mentary detailed clinical studies in humans.
