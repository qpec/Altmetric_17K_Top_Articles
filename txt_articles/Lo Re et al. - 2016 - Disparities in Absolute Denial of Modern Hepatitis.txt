Abstract
Background & Aims—The high costs of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents to treat chronic 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have resulted in denials of treatment, but it is not clear whether 
patients’ access to these therapies differs with their type of insurance.
Methods—We conducted a prospective cohort study among all patients who had a DAA 
prescription submitted between November 1, 2014 and April 30, 2015 to Burman’s Specialty 
Pharmacy, which provides HCV pharmacy services to patients in Delaware, Maryland, New 
Jersey, and Pennsylvania. We determined the incidence of absolute denial of DAA prescription, 
defined as lack of approval of prescription fill by the insurer, according to type of insurance (US 
Medicaid, US Medicare, commercial insurance). Multivariable Poisson regression was used to 
estimate adjusted relative risks (RRs) of absolute denial associated with patient characteristics.
Results—Among 2321 patients prescribed a DAA regimen (503 covered by Medicaid; 795 by 
Medicare; 1023 by commercial insurance), 377 (16.2%) received an absolute denial. The most 
common reasons for absolute denial were insufficient information to assess medical need (134 
[35.5%]) and lack of medical necessity (132 [35.0%]). A higher proportion of patients covered by 
Medicaid received an absolute denial (233 [46.3%]) than those covered by Medicare (40 [5.0%]; 
P<.001) or commercial insurance (104 [10.2%]; P<.001). Medicaid insurance (adjusted RR, 4.14; 
95% confidence interval, 3.38–5.08) and absence of cirrhosis (adjusted RR, 1.96; 95% confidence 
interval, 1.53–2.50) were associated with absolute denial.
Conclusions—There are significant disparities in access to DAA-based treatments for HCV 
infection among patients with different types of insurance. Nearly half of Medicaid beneficiaries 
in Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania were denied access to these drugs for 
chronic HCV infection.
Keywords
hepatitis C; direct-acting antiviral; insurance
Over 3.2 million people in the US are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
infection.1 If left untreated, chronic HCV can cause progressive liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, 
leading to hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma.2 Viral eradication after 
antiviral therapy reduces the risk of liver complications and death, even with advanced 
hepatic fibrosis.3 Consequently, HCV treatment guidelines have recommended antiviral 
therapy for all chronic HCV-infected patients.4,5
Highly efficacious direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents were approved by the US Food and 
Drug Administration in 2014 to treat chronic HCV.6–8 However, their high costs have led 
insurers to restrict access to these medications,9–12 requiring that patients meet insurer-
specific criteria for approval, such as evidence of advanced liver fibrosis, consultation with a 
specialist, or abstinence from alcohol or illicit drug use.13,14 Two recent reports highlighted 
the restrictions on reimbursement of DAAs across the US state Medicaid programs and

 revealed considerable heterogeneity by state in the criteria for approval.15,16 Little is known 
about restrictions to HCV treatment among US Medicare and commercial insurance 
beneficiaries.
As a consequence of these varying restrictions, insurers have required that DAA 
prescriptions undergo prior authorization, a pre-approval process to determine if the patient 
meets insurer-specific criteria for HCV treatment. Prescriptions may be denied after this 
review, but the decision can be appealed by the provider. The insurer may overturn the 
denial, if given sufficient supporting information, or uphold the decision. DAA prescriptions 
that ultimately are not filled because of a lack of insurer approval are considered absolutely 
denied. Data are lacking on the incidence of absolute denial of DAA prescription and factors 
associated with this outcome in clinical practice settings. These data are important because 
absolute denial of HCV treatment by insurers might have adverse outcomes on patients and 
could harm patient-provider relationships.
We evaluated the incidence of absolute denial of DAA therapy among a sample of US 
chronic HCV-infected patients by type of insurance. Since the criteria for reimbursement of 
DAA medications may be more restrictive within the Medicaid program than within other 
types of insurance,15,16 we hypothesized that absolute denial of DAA treatment would be 
more common among Medicaid beneficiaries. We also evaluated the reasons for absolute 
denial given by the insurers, factors associated with absolute denial, and time to fill among 
those whose prescription was approved.
METHODS
Study Design and Data Source
We conducted a prospective cohort study using data from Burman’s Specialty Pharmacy, 
which provides HCV pharmacy services to community and academic medical practices 
across Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. DAAs are often dispensed by 
specialty pharmacies because of their high costs and requirements for special handling and 
delivery.17 Burman’s obtains medical information from clinicians to complete the prior 
authorization request and submits the prescription and request to the insurer. Burman’s uses 
an electronic record system to collect data on demographics, health insurance, and 
prescribed medications. Clinical information submitted to the pharmacy by the clinician for 
the prior authorization request, including documentation of hepatic fibrosis stage, human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection, and previous HCV treatment and response, is 
also electronically recorded. Burman’s collects information from prescribing clinicians on 
alcohol or drug use when requested for the prior authorization. The study was approved by 
the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board.
Study Patients
Patients were included if they were infected with HCV genotype 1, 2, or 3 (the most 
common HCV genotypes in the US18) and had a DAA prescription submitted to the 
pharmacy between November 1, 2014 and April 30, 2015 (the first six months that 
interferon-containing regimens were no longer recommended as first-line therapy4). Patients

 were excluded if their prior authorization was completed by an outside pharmacy (since 
medical information might not be available to Burman’s), their insurer mandated use of a 
different pharmacy, or they had no health insurance. If a patient had multiple DAA treatment 
courses prescribed during the period of interest, only the first regimen was included.
Main Study Outcomes
The primary outcome was absolute denial of DAA prescription, defined as lack of approval 
of DAA fill by the insurer, even after appeal. Burman’s ascertained the status of all 
prescriptions with the insurers through September 30, 2015.
As secondary outcomes, we evaluated: 1) the reason given by the insurer for absolute denial, 
2) denial preceding prescription approval, 3) any denial (composite of either absolute denial 
or denial preceding insurer approval), 4) time to DAA fill (days from receipt of the DAA 
prescription by the pharmacy to the date of fill), and 5) time to absolute denial (days from 
receipt of the DAA prescription by the pharmacy to the date of absolute denial).
Data Collection
Demographic and clinical data collected from Burman’s electronic records at the time the 
DAA prescription was received by the pharmacy included: age; sex; race; insurance; HCV 
RNA; HCV genotype; presence of cirrhosis (based on clinician report from liver biopsy or 
non-invasive test); history of HCV treatment and response (based on prior prescription fills 
for antiviral therapy and/or clinician report); HIV status (reported by clinician); DAA 
regimen prescribed; and date of DAA prescription receipt by the pharmacy. Insurance was 
classified as US Medicaid (joint federal- and state-funded programs for medical care and 
drug benefits for low-income and special-needs individuals19), US Medicare (federal health 
insurance program available to Americans aged ≥65 years and to those under 65 years with 
certain disabilities or chronic health conditions20), or commercial insurance (health benefits 
that are employer-sponsored, privately purchased, or obtained via health exchange through 
the Affordable Care Act21). Patients were classified according to the insurance plan to which 
the DAA prescription was submitted. Patients covered by Medicaid fee-for-service or 
Medicaid managed care were classified as having Medicaid insurance.
Data collected after receipt of the DAA prescription included dates of: completion of prior 
authorization, insurer denial preceding approval, absolute denial by insurer, appeal of the 
insurer’s decision by the clinician, and DAA fill.
Statistical Analysis
Follow-up began on the date that the DAA prescription was received by the specialty 
pharmacy and continued until the pharmacy ascertained the final outcome for the 
prescription (i.e., absolute denial, DAA prescription fill) or determined that the prior 
authorization request was incomplete (i.e., after 60 days of inactivity). Patients who had an 
incomplete prior authorization were excluded from analyses since a completed prior 
authorization is required for insurer review and a decision to either approve or deny the 
DAA prescription.

 The incidence of absolute denial of DAA prescription was determined, overall and by type 
of insurance, cirrhosis status, and HCV genotype. The reason given by the insurer for the 
absolute denial was evaluated. We also calculated the incidence of denial preceding 
prescription approval and of any DAA denial, by insurance type.
Next, we used multivariable Poisson regression with a robust error variance to estimate the 
relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of absolute denial associated with 
patient factors.22 We used Poisson, rather than logistic, regression because odds ratios may 
overestimate RRs when the outcome of interest is common, as in this study.23 We 
hypothesized that Medicaid coverage and absence of cirrhosis would be the strongest 
determinants of absolute denial. Other variables evaluated within the multivariable model 
included age, sex, race, genotype, prior HCV treatment, HIV, and time period of DAA 
prescription (DAA prescribed within the first three months of the observation period versus 
latter three months). To avoid bias from missing data, we implemented multiple imputation 
using chained equations.24 Twenty imputed datasets were created using all of the variables 
from the Poisson model, including absolute denial status. Results across the 20 datasets were 
combined to arrive at CIs that accounted for within- and across-dataset variances.25
Finally, we determined the median time to DAA fill, by insurance. Results were stratified 
according to receipt of insurer denial prior to approval. The median time to absolute denial 
was also calculated. Data were analyzed using Stata 12.1 (Stata Corporation, College 
Station, TX).
RESULTS
Study Patients
Between November 1, 2014 and April 30, 2015, Burman’s received DAA prescriptions for 
3,791 patients. After exclusions (Figure 1), 2,342 patients remained. Among these, 21 
(0.9%) had an incomplete prior authorization after 60 days and were excluded, leaving 2,321 
patients (503 with Medicaid [492 (97.8%) Medicaid managed care; 11 (2.2%) Medicaid fee-
for-service]; 795 with Medicare; 1,023 with commercial insurance). Medicaid patients were 
younger, more commonly black, and more frequently HCV treatment-naïve than those with 
Medicare or commercial insurance (Table 1). Cirrhosis and HIV coinfection were more 
frequent among patients with Medicaid and Medicare than commercial insurance (p<0.01 
for all comparisons). HCV genotype 1 was the most common genotype across the insurance 
types.
Incidence of Absolute Denial
Among these 2,321 patients, 377 (16.2%; 95% CI, 14.8–17.8%) were absolutely denied their 
DAA prescription. Absolute denial was more common for patients with Medicaid (233 
[46.3%]) than Medicare (40 [5.0%]; p<0.001) or commercial insurance (104 [10.2%]; 
p<0.001; Figure 2). When the analysis was restricted to the 715 patients with cirrhosis, the 
incidence of absolute denial remained higher for patients with Medicaid (42/165 [25.4%]) 
than Medicare (4/281 [1.4%]; p<0.001) or commercial insurance (8/269 [3.0%]; p<0.001). 
Among Medicaid beneficiaries, no statistically significant difference in absolute denial rate

 was observed by state (Delaware: 8/14 [57.1%]; Maryland: 8/17 [47.1%]; New Jersey: 35/94 
[37.2%]; Pennsylvania: 182/378 [48.2%]; p=0.06). Absolute denial of DAA prescription was 
more frequent among patients with HCV genotype 3 (24/76 [31.6%]) than genotype 1 
(327/2,114 [15.5%]; p<0.001) but not significantly different compared to genotype 2 
(26/131 [19.9%]; p=0.06). There was no difference in the incidence of absolute denial 
between patients with genotype 1 and 2 (p=0.18).
Table 2 reports the incidence of DAA denial preceding insurer approval. When the 
composite of either absolute denial or denial preceding approval (i.e., any denial) was 
evaluated, 690 patients (29.7%; 95% CI, 27.9–31.6%) received a denial of DAA treatment. 
Receipt of any denial was nearly 4-fold more common for Medicaid (356 [70.8%]) than 
Medicare (143 [18.0%]; p<0.001) or commercially insured patients (191 [18.7%]; p<0.001; 
Figure 2). Among patients issued any denial, an appeal of the insurer’s decision by the 
clinician was less commonly filed for patients with Medicaid (38/356 [10.7%]) than 
Medicare (39/143 [27.3%]; p<0.001) or commercial insurance (41/191 [21.5%]; p<0.001).
Table 2 reports the frequency of DAA prescription approval and absolute denial categorized 
by reason reported by the insurer, according to type of insurance. Overall, the most common 
reasons for absolute denial were insufficient information to assess medical need (134 
[35.5%]) and lack of medical necessity (132 [35.0%]), and these were the most frequently 
reported reasons among Medicaid beneficiaries as well.
Factors Associated with Absolute Denial
In the multivariable analysis, Medicaid insurance, absence of cirrhosis, and DAA 
prescription in the initial three months of the 6-month observation period were associated 
with a higher risk of absolute denial (Table 3). Higher age and Medicare coverage were 
associated with a lower risk of absolute denial. Sex, race, HCV genotype, prior HCV 
treatment, and HIV coinfection were not associated with absolute denial. HCV genotype 3 
was not associated with an increased risk of absolute denial in multivariable analysis.
Median Time to Prescription Fill
The median time to DAA fill was longer for Medicaid than Medicare or commercially 
insured patients (Table 4). Among patients who had a denial preceding insurer approval, the 
median time to fill was substantially longer for all insurance types, but remained greater for 
Medicaid patients. The median time to absolute denial was shorter for patients with 
Medicaid and Medicare than commercial insurance.
DISCUSSION
In this study of chronic HCV-infected patients prescribed DAA-based HCV therapy across 
Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania between November 2014 and April 
2015, 16% were absolutely denied treatment by their insurance carrier. Notably, 46% of 
Medicaid beneficiaries from these states did not have their prescription approved for fill, and 
this was substantially higher than those with Medicare or commercial insurance. The 
disparity was even more evident among those with cirrhosis, with 25% of Medicaid 
beneficiaries absolutely denied treatment compared to almost none of those with other types

 of insurance. Lack of medical necessity and incomplete data to determine medical need were 
the most frequently reported reasons for absolute denial among Medicaid beneficiaries. 
Finally, Medicaid patients experienced a longer time to prescription fill than those with 
Medicare or commercial insurance. These data confirm the effects of restrictive pre-approval 
policies for new HCV treatments and provide concerning evidence of a disparity in access to 
HCV treatment.
The high incidence of DAA prescription denials among Medicaid beneficiaries in this study, 
along with the longer time to fill, is likely a direct consequence of the restrictive criteria for 
approval of these drugs that have been implemented across state Medicaid programs, which 
has been highlighted in recent reports.15,16 Faced with the high cost of DAAs, limited 
budgets, and the potential that future regimens currently being studied in clinical trials may 
decrease drug prices through competition, state-run Medicaid programs have elected to 
prioritize certain groups over others when deciding whether to allocate DAA treatments. 
One review found that 74% of Medicaid programs required evidence of advanced hepatic 
fibrosis or cirrhosis, 69% requested prescription by or consultation with a specialist, and 
50% required a period of abstinence from drugs and/or alcohol.15 Our study’s findings that 
Medicaid coverage and lack of cirrhosis were important factors associated with absolute 
denial are consistent with these reports.
Lack of medical necessity was a frequent reason reported by insurers for absolute denial of 
DAA therapy. During the 6-month observation period covered by this study, guidelines 
issued by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and Infectious Diseases 
Society of America recommended antiviral treatment for all patients with chronic HCV, but 
prioritized DAA-based HCV therapy for certain subgroups, particularly those with advanced 
hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis.4 As of October 2015, these HCV treatment guidelines no longer 
provide prioritizations for DAA therapy.5 DAA treatments have also been shown to be cost-
effective in recent analyses.26–28 Our finding that prescription of DAA treatment in the latter 
three months of our observation period was less likely to be associated with denial may 
suggest that insurers are relaxing criteria for reimbursement over time.
Medicaid patients were also commonly denied treatment due to insufficient information to 
assess medical need. It is unclear why so many patients were denied for this reason since 
these patients had complete prior authorization requests that should have contained the 
materials needed to justify approval. In most instances, the specific information that was 
missing was not reported in the denial letter to the clinician, making it difficult to appeal the 
decision. This lack of specificity might have been the reason that fewer appeals were filed by 
providers caring for Medicaid patients. Future studies should also investigate whether 
providers for Medicaid patients are less able to navigate through the prior authorization 
process and if information required from Medicaid patients is different from those with other 
types of insurance.
The implications of absolute denial of DAA treatment remain unknown. However, patients 
denied access to new DAA therapies may have continued progression of hepatic fibrosis and 
remain at risk for the development of cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and hepatocellular 
carcinoma. Indeed, a recent analysis using data from the Veterans Health Administration 
Re et al.

 suggests that deferring anti-HCV therapy until the development of advanced hepatic fibrosis/
cirrhosis reduces treatment effectiveness and increases risk of liver-related complications 
and death.29 A separate analysis among HIV/HCV-coinfected patients in the Swiss HIV 
Cohort Study found that deferring treatment from METAVIR stage F2 until stage F3 or F4 
increased the risk of liver-related death 2-fold and 5-fold, respectively.30 Denial of DAA 
treatment can also lead to ongoing HCV-associated inflammation, which might increase the 
risk of extra-hepatic complications, including bone,31,32 kidney,33,34 cardiovascular,35 and 
neuropsychiatric disease.36 Further, failure to treat and cure chronic HCV can lead to 
continued risk of HCV transmission. Denial of DAA therapy might also promote anxiety 
and stress about HCV disease progression and provoke distrust among patients of the 
healthcare system and their providers. Clinicians are then challenged to explain the denial, 
and important opportunities for patient engagement, education, and cure could be 
irrevocably lost.
This study had several potential limitations. Since Medicaid programs have different criteria 
for DAA prescription, our findings among the Medicaid patients within Delaware, 
Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania might not be generalizable to beneficiaries in other 
states.37 Our results might also not be generalizable to patients covered by integrated health 
plans. Further, our analysis included a sample of chronic HCV-infected patients from one 
specialty pharmacy in the US Mid-Atlantic region and may not be representative of chronic 
HCV patients nationally or reflect prescription outcomes at other pharmacies dispensing 
DAA therapy. However, the characteristics of the patients in this study are similar to those 
within recent DAA treatment trials6–8 and observational studies of chronic HCV-infected 
patients.1,38
Moreover, this study evaluated access to DAA therapy during the period when the first all-
oral DAA regimens were available and the market was dominated by one supplier. The 
recent release of several new DAAs (e.g., daclatasvir, elbasvir/grazoprevir) appears to be 
resulting in greater price competition, which could allow greater access to these agents in the 
future. In addition, on November 5, 2015, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
notified states that restricting access to DAA drugs is contrary to the statutory requirements 
within section 1927 of the Social Security Act.39 They also sent letters to DAA drug 
manufacturers inquiring about opportunities for discount or value-based purchasing 
arrangements to make these medications more affordable. The long-term effects of an 
expanding supply of agents and pressure from government sources on treatment access 
remain to be seen.
In conclusion, most Medicare and commercial insurance beneficiaries have access to DAA-
based treatment for chronic HCV infection, but nearly half of the Medicaid beneficiaries 
within Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania were denied access. Notably, 
nearly one quarter of Medicaid recipients with cirrhosis experienced treatment denial. 
Medicaid patients from these states also experienced a longer time to prescription fill than 
those with Medicare or commercial insurance. These data show that the restrictive pre-
approval policies for DAA therapies among Medicaid beneficiaries have led to an important 
disparity in access to HCV therapy that must be addressed.
