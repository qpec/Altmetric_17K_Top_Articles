Abstract
Most drugs of abuse lead to a general blunting of dopamine release in the chronic phase of 
dependence, which contributes to poor outcome. To test whether cannabis dependence is 
associated with a similar dopaminergic deficit, we examined striatal and extrastriatal dopamine 
release in severely cannabis dependent participants (CD), free of any comorbid conditions, 
including nicotine use. Eleven CD and twelve healthy controls (HC) completed two positron 
emission tomography scans with [11C]-(+)-PHNO, before and after oral administration of d-
amphetamine. CD stayed inpatient for 5–7 days prior to the scans to standardize abstinence. 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRS) measures of glutamate in the striatum and hippocampus 
were obtained in the same subjects. Percent change in [11C]-(+)-PHNO binding potential (ΔBPND) 
was compared between groups and correlations with MRS glutamate, subclinical 
psychopathological and neurocognitive parameters were examined. CD had significantly lower 
ΔBPND in the striatum (p=0.002, effect size (ES)=1.48), including the associative striatum 
(p=0.003, ES=1.39), sensorimotor striatum (p=0.003, ES=1.41), and the pallidus (p=0.012, 
ES=1.16). Lower dopamine release in the associative striatum correlated with inattention and 
negative symptoms in CD, and with poorer working memory and probabilistic category learning 
performance in both CD and HC. No relationships to MRS glutamate and amphetamine-induced

 subclinical positive symptoms were detected. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that 
severe cannabis dependence -without the confounds of any comorbidity- is associated with a 
deficit in striatal dopamine release. This deficit extends to other extrastriatal areas and predicts 
subclinical psychopathology.
Introduction
Cannabis dependence, now referred to as a cannabis use disorder1, is a relatively common 
disorder with an estimated prevalence as high as 8.3% in young adults in the United States 2. 
It is a public health concern as cannabis use has been associated with psychosis and 
depression3, 4. The exact effects of cannabis on the brain are not well understood, however, 
brain imaging studies show that it is associated with altered brain structure and function 5.
Cannabis exerts its effect on the brain primarily through the psychoactive component 
Δ9tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC is a partial agonist at the endocannabinoid receptor 
(CB1), which is widely expressed throughout the brain, with particularly high densities in 
the basal ganglia and substantia nigra pars reticulata 6. THC stimulates neuronal firing of 
mesolimbic dopamine neurons and elevates striatal dopamine levels in animals 7. In humans, 
acute THC induced striatal dopamine release in some 8–10, but not all studies 11, 12.
Dependence on dopamine-enhancing substances of abuse is associated with blunted striatal 
dopamine transmission 13, 14. Previously, we studied amphetamine-induced dopamine 
release in chronic cannabis users (CD) who were able to stay abstinent until THC was 
undetectable in their urine 15. Using positron emission tomography (PET) and 
[11C]raclopride, we found no differences in striatal amphetamine-induced dopamine release 
between CD and healthy controls (HC). Similarly, Mizrahi et al. found no difference 
between CD and HC in stress-induced dopamine release using [11C]-(+)-PHNO 16. 
However, Volkow et al. found deficits in methylphenidate-induced striatal dopamine release 
in CD with [11C]raclopride, when comparing across groups changes in distribution volumes 
(VT) but not in binding potential (BPND) 17. Studies in CD with comorbid psychotic 
symptoms also showed reduced dopamine synthesis capacity 18 and reduced stress-induced 
dopamine release 19. In summary, studies that included CD with psychotic symptoms 
suggest that chronic cannabis use is associated with reduced dopamine release; for users 
without psychotic symptoms, results are inconsistent. These inconsistencies could be related 
to recency of cannabis use, effects of concomitant use of other drugs either in the cannabis 
users or in the control groups, severity of cannabis use, which may vary across cohorts 
and/or methodological limitations of the quantification of dopamine changes with PET 
[11C]raclopride. The aim of our study was to measure striatal dopamine release capacity in 
CD who did not use other substances of abuse (including nicotine), whose abstinence period 
could be standardized, and who had no other major psychiatric illnesses or comorbid drug 
use, using a more sensitive PET radiotracer for quantification of dopamine changes. We 
examined amphetamine-induced dopamine release with PET and the dopamine D2/3 receptor 
(D2/3) agonist tracer [11C]-(+)-PHNO, which is more sensitive to the dopamine-releasing 
effects of amphetamine than the D2/3 antagonist tracer [11C]raclopride 20, 21 and allowed us 
to examine extrastriatal regions including midbrain, globus pallidus and thalamus. We

 hypothesized that the magnitude of striatal dopamine release would be reduced in CD 
compared to HC. Since deficits in neurocognitive function, including working memory, 
impulsivity and attention have previously been associated with cannabis use 22 and with 
decreased striatal dopamine function 23, 24, we also predicted that low DA release in CD 
would negatively correlate with neurocognitive function and positively correlate with 
psychosis-related symptoms.
In addition, since schizophrenia is associated with elevated glutamate levels in the 
hippocampus and striatum25, 26, and given that cannabis use is associated with psychosis27, 
we explored striatal and hippocampal glutamate levels and their relationship to striatal 
dopamine release in this cohort, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). This was 
also motivated by reports showing that glutamate in the hippocampus modulates striatal 
dopamine release28 and that cannabis use may directly affect striatal glutamate 29, 30. Thus, 
we hypothesized that cannabis users would show altered glutamate levels in the 
hippocampus and striatum, as in patients with schizophrenia, and these alterations may 
correlate with dopamine release.
Methods
Study population
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the New York State 
Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI) and Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC). All 
participants provided written informed consent. The inclusion criteria for the CD 
participants were: age 21–55 years; DSM-IV criteria for cannabis dependence or current 
marijuana use of average twice per day at least five days per week for the past 4 weeks; not 
currently seeking treatment; and currently using as evidenced by positive urine toxicology 
for cannabis at the time of recruitment and on admission to the inpatient unit. CD 
participants were excluded if they had any other Axis I diagnosis, including current and/or 
previous substance dependence or nicotine abuse. Only occasional cigarette smoking (<2 
times per month) and past depressive episodes were allowed. HC participants had no current 
or past DSM-IV Axis I diagnosis, as determined by the DIGS 31. Participants were free of 
significant medical and neurological illnesses, did not use psychotropic medications or 
substances of abuse (confirmed with urine drug toxicology), had no clinically significant 
brain abnormalities on a T1-weighted MRI scan, and were not pregnant or nursing. Groups 
were matched for age, gender, ethnicity and parental socioeconomic status. Participants were 
recruited through advertisements, word of mouth, and referrals from other researchers.
Assessments
Cannabis dependence was confirmed using the Psychiatric Research Interview for Substance 
and Mental Disorders for DSM-IV (PRISM-IV) 32. CD participants estimated the number of 
joints, blunts, or bowls used each day for the prior 30 days using the Time Line Follow 
Back 33 and estimated the quantity of marijuana used in a joint, blunt or bowl as the 
equivalent amount of dried basil, which was then weighed by a member of the research 
team. The product of these two quantities provided an estimate of the amount of marijuana

 used by each CD participant each day. The day prior to the PET scan, CD participants 
completed the Marijuana Craving Questionnaire 34.
All participants completed additional assessments on the day prior to their PET scans, i.e. 
for CD after 5–7 days of abstinence from cannabis. These included the Barratt 
Impulsiveness Scale (BIS) 35, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) 36, the 
Hollingshead interview for socio-economic status (for participants and their parents) 37, and 
two computerized neurocognitive tests: the n-back task 38 and the weather prediction task 39. 
The n-back task assesses working memory. Outcome measure was the adjusted hit rate, i.e. 
the percent of properly identified targets corrected for false positives, in the 2-back and 3-
back conditions. The weather prediction task assesses probabilistic category learning. 
Outcome measure was the percent optimal responses, i.e. the proportion of trials in which 
the high probability outcome (rain or sun) was selected.
The PANSS was repeated on the PET scan day two hours after amphetamine administration.
All clinical and neurocognitive assessments were administered by trained raters.
PET data acquisition
CD participants were admitted to the inpatient unit of NYSPI for 5–7 days directly prior to 
the PET scan procedures to ensure abstinence from cannabis during this period. Participants 
underwent two PET scans in one day with [11C]-(+)-PHNO (for detailed methods see 
Supplement). In short, a 120-min baseline scan was acquired, followed immediately by oral 
administration of amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg). A second 120-min scan was acquired 3-hours 
after amphetamine administration (5 hours between radiotracer injections). Data were 
acquired in list mode on a Biograph mCT PET-CT scanner (Siemens, Knoxville TN), binned 
into a sequence of frames of increasing duration and reconstructed by filtered back 
projection using manufacturer-provided software.
PET data analysis
PET data were motion corrected and registered to the individual’s T1-weighted MRI scan 
using SPM2 software. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn on each subject’s MRI and 
transferred to the coregistered PET data. Included ROIs were midbrain, thalamus, globus 
pallidus, associative striatum (AST), including pre-commissural dorsal caudate, post-
commissural caudate and pre-commissural dorsal putamen, the limbic striatum (LST), which 
comprises the ventral striatum (VST), and the sensorimotor striatum (SMST), which 
comprises the post-commissural putamen as in 40. The cerebellum was included as a 
reference region.
Time activity curves were formed as the mean activity in each ROI in each frame. Data were 
analyzed using the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM)41 to determine the binding 
potential relative to the non-displaceable compartment (BPND).
The primary outcome measure was the relative reduction in BPND for [11C]-(+)-PHNO 
(ΔBPND), reflecting amphetamine-induced dopamine release, calculated according to:
van de Giessen et al.

 Additionally, voxelwise analysis was performed (for details see Supplement). BPND was 
computed at each voxel to form BPND maps and these were nonlinearly transformed into 
MNI space. Statistical analysis was done by 2-group t-test for BPND and ΔBPND maps.
MRI/MRS data acquisition
MRI and MRS studies were performed using a 3.0T MRI system (Achieva, Philips, Best, 
The Netherlands) and a SENSE 8 channel head coil. Participants were instructed to lie still 
and close their eyes but stay awake. High-resolution T1-weighted images were acquired and 
used for PET coregistration and ROI delineation and to determine placement of MRS voxels 
in hippocampus and striatum (see supplemental methods for details of MRI and MRS 
acquisition and analysis). Outcome measures for MRS were concentration ratios of Glx (the 
combined concentration of glutamate and glutamine, which is more stable than glutamate 
alone) and Glutamate (Glu) to total Creatine (tCr, i.e. Creatine + Phospho-Creatine).
Statistical analyses
We used t-tests and Fisher’s exact tests for between-group comparisons of clinical, 
demographic and dopamine release measures. Voxelwise statistical analyses were performed 
using SPM12 software.
Relationships between dopamine release in the AST and clinical and cognitive measures 
were investigated on an exploratory basis in all participants by performing linear regressions 
with a clinical/cognitive measure as the dependent variable and 3 independent variables: 
group, AST ΔBPND and the interaction term. When the interaction term was not significant 
the model was rerun with only group and AST ΔBPND . The relationship between positive 
symptoms and AST ΔBPND was tested using Pearson correlation (only in CD due to lack of 
variability in HC).
For exploratory analyses, Pearson correlations were performed between ΔBPND in the 
functional striatal subregions and all cannabis-use-severity measures. For correlations 
between ΔBPND and age of onset and use/duration measures we used partial correlations 
including current age.
Results
Participants
Sixty-two cannabis-smoking participants were recruited for in-person screening. Of those, 
21 were disqualified for Axis I diagnosis other than cannabis dependence, 9 for negative 
urine screen for cannabis, 8 for comorbid substance use, and one each for a neurological 
condition, a history of aggression, or risk factors for coronary artery disease. Eight CD 
qualified but decided not to participate. Thirteen CD and 15 HC participated in PET, 
however 2 participants (1 CD, 1 HC) did not complete the PET protocol due to

 radiochemistry failure and subsequent loss to follow-up, 2 participants’ (1 CD, 1 HC) PET 
data were not usable due to scan interruption for emesis, and 1 HC was excluded due to 
psychiatric comorbidity revealed during the study, but undetected at screening. Eleven CD 
and 12 HC participants completed all study procedures and were included in the analysis. 
Demographics and use history are displayed in Table 1. For each subject, both PET scans 
were acquired on the same day with 2 exceptions: two HC participants received their 
baseline and post-amphetamine scans on separate days due to [11C]-(+)-PHNO chemistry 
failure for the post-amphetamine scan on the initial day.
PET Parameters, Regional Volumes and Plasma Amphetamine Levels
Neither the average injected [11C]-(+)-PHNO radioactivity, nor the injected PHNO mass per 
kilogram of body weight differed between groups or scans (Table 1). Regional volumes did 
not differ between groups (Supplemental Table S1), nor did plasma amphetamine levels 
(Table 1).
PET results
Baseline BPND did not differ between groups in any ROI. Amphetamine produced a robust 
decrease of BPND in all ROIs in all participants (Table 2 and Supplemental Figure S3). 
Comparison of ΔBPND between groups revealed less release in the CD group in the striatum 
as a whole (p=0.002, effect size (ES)=1.48) and in the AST (p=0.003, ES=1.39) and SMST 
(p=0.003, ES=1.41). Among extra-striatal ROIs, between-group differences reached 
statistical significance only in the pallidus (p=0.010, ES=1.16). Voxelwise results were 
similar to the ROI results, with no significant group differences in baseline BPND and large 
significant clusters of group differences in ΔBPND bilaterally in dorsal striatum (Figure 1 
and Supplemental Figure S4).
Clinical and cognitive measures and their correlation with dopamine release
Characterization of cannabis use severity in the CD group is shown in Table 1. Exploratory 
analyses showed no significant correlations between dopamine release and severity of 
cannabis use in any striatal subdivision.
CD had higher self-reported inattention symptoms on the BIS than HC (p=0.018; although 
this was not significant after correction for multiple comparisons), higher levels of baseline 
positive symptoms (p=0.002) and general symptoms (p=0.009) on the PANSS but the groups 
did not differ in negative symptoms or amphetamine-induced positive symptoms (Table 1). 
There was no significant relationship between positive symptoms and dopamine release in 
the AST in CD (p=0.31). Lower dopamine release in the AST was associated with greater 
negative symptoms in CD (standardized β=-1.09, p=0.012), but not in HC (standardized 
β=0.11, p=0.70, group-by-ΔBPND interaction standardized β =2.4, p=0.024); and with 
higher inattention scores in CD (standardized β=-0.83, p=0.029; although this was not 
significant after correction for multiple comparisons) but not in HC (standardized β=0.30 
p=0.27); interaction standardized β=2.3, p=0.019; Figure 2).
The groups did not differ on working memory or probabilistic category learning 
performance (Table 1). Lower dopamine release in the AST was associated with lower

 performance on both tasks in the groups combined (working memory: standardized β=0.77 
p=0.002; probabilistic category learning: standardized β=0.74 p=0.003, Figure 2). There was 
no significant group-by-performance interaction for either task (p-values>0.35).
MRS results
There were no significant differences between groups in Glx/tCr or Glu/tCr, nor were there 
significant correlations between dopamine release in any ROI with Glx/tCr or Glu/tCr in 
either MRS voxel. There were no group differences in tCr, grey and white matter fractions in 
the MRS voxels and no interaction of group by CSF portion on metabolite ratios 
(Supplemental Table S2).
Discussion
Our study provides evidence for a deficit in the capacity for striatal dopamine release in CD 
without the confounds of recent cannabis use or other comorbidities such as other substance 
use, tobacco smoking or psychiatric disorders. Lower striatal dopamine release also 
correlated with measures of psychopathology in CD. Baseline dopamine D2/3 BPND did not 
differ between CD and HC, in line with previous findings 15, 17, 42, 43, in contrast with other 
addictive substances of abuse 13, 14. MRS measures of glutamate in hippocampus and 
striatum did not differ between CD and HC and did not relate to dopamine release. 
Therefore this study does not provide evidence to support a role for glutamate in the 
dysregulation of dopamine in cannabis dependence.
The finding of dopamine deficit observed here contrasts with our previously published 
report 15, which showed no deficits in striatal dopamine release. There are several important 
differences between these two studies that may account for the divergent results. Our prior 
study required abstinence for 3 weeks on an outpatient basis, which by design excluded the 
more severely addicted subjects who were unable to abstain and thus dropped out of the 
abstinence phase, leaving us with a sample of users with less problematic use. Here by 
requiring a shorter inpatient abstinence period we were able to retain the more problematic 
severe users. To further explore this potential interpretation of the differences between the 
two studies, as illustrated in Figure 3, we combined data from both cohorts to show the 
severity of use versus dopamine release for each subject, normalized to the mean of their 
own healthy control comparison group. The plot suggests an inverse relationship between 
frequency of use and magnitude of amphetamine-induced dopamine release, supporting the 
interpretation that severity of dependence, indexed by frequency of use, is associated with 
dopamine deficits, and contributed to the different results across the two cohorts. 
Additionally, the longer abstinence (3 weeks vs 5 days) in our first cohort may have 
contributed to a normalization of any dopamine deficit that may have been present prior to 
or during the abstinence period. Reduced CB1 receptor availability in chronic heavy users 
begins to reverse after 4 weeks of abstinence 44, and cerebral blood volume partially 
normalizes after 4 weeks of abstinence 45. It is also possible that a state of relative 
withdrawal, after 5 days of abstinence, may have contributed to the reduced dopaminergic 
response we measured. One risk of shorter abstinence is the potential direct effect of 
cannabis on our outcome measure due to incomplete washout. We do not believe this is the

 case here because plasma levels of THC and its metabolites are very low after few days 46. 
Finally, other differences from our previous study 15 include the use of oral instead of 
intravenous amphetamine administration, although this is unlikely to have affected the 
outcome, and [11C]-(+)-PHNO, a radioligand that is more sensitive to the dopamine-
releasing effects of amphetamine than [11C]raclopride, which may have allowed more power 
to detect differences among groups.
A strength of this study, as opposed to previous reports 16–18, is the strict selection of CD 
with no psychiatric comorbidities to reduce confounding factors and isolate the effect of 
cannabis dependence. In particular, exclusion of nicotine dependence is important because 
tobacco smoking has substantial impact on the likelihood of cannabis relapse as measured in 
the human laboratory 47, and nicotine dependence is associated with decreased availability 
of striatal D2/3 48. These potentially confounding relationships highlight the importance of 
excluding chronic tobacco smokers when assessing effects of chronic cannabis use on 
striatal dopamine release.
Although we observed reduced dopamine release in the striatum as a whole in CD 
participants, the subregions of the striatum most affected were the AST and SMST, in 
contrast to other drug addictions, where deficits in LST dopamine release are greatest and 
predict craving 13, 14. A possible explanation could be the differential anatomical distribution 
of the CB1 receptor, the target of THC. CB1 levels are lower in the ventral striatum 
compared to the putamen (data in in human brain) 49 or dorsal striatum (data in rat 
brain) 50, 51. In addition, CB1 levels are higher in the pallidus compared to thalamus in 
humans 6, mirroring our findings of greater impact in pallidus compared to thalamus. This 
suggests a direct pharmacological effect of chronic, heavy cannabis use on dopamine 
release. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that striatal dopamine release is also 
reduced in the LST, but difficult to detect due to greater variability in this ROI. The same 
reasoning could apply to the midbrain and thalamus.
Another factor to consider regarding the regional pattern of dopaminergic deficits is the 
differential distribution of dopamine D3 receptors (D3) across the ROIs we report on here, 
since [11C]-(+)-PHNO has higher affinity for D3 than D252, as does dopamine53. While this 
study was not designed to rule out possible differences in D3 availability between CD and 
HC, this appears to be a less parsimonious explanation than differences in dopamine release. 
We observed deficits in the SMST, which has been shown to have negligible D3, and in the 
AST, which has low D3, in HC 54, and therefore differences between groups in [11C]-(+)-
PHNO binding are unlikely to be explained by higher D3 expression in the dorsal striatum of 
HC than CD. Conversely, we saw no group differences in several regions known to have 
high expression of D3 (LST, midbrain, thalamus) but a detectable difference in pallidus 
(although not significant in the voxelwise analysis), where D3 accounts for 60% or more of 
baseline [11C]-(+)-PHNO BPND, and where we did not detect any differences in baseline 
BPND. Therefore, while we cannot strictly rule out the possibility that group differences in 
D3 expression contributed to our results, a more plausible explanation is that the deficit is 
related to presynaptic dopamine storage and release capacity. The observed group 
differences are also unlikely to have been caused by mass carryover effects at D3 receptors 
where the affinity of [11C]-(+)-PHNO is high55–58, both because there is low to negligible 
van de Giessen et al.

 D3 expression in the SMST and AST, where the strongest group differences were observed, 
and because there were five hours between the two PET injections, which has been shown to 
lead to negligible mass carryover in dorsal striatum59. To address the extent to which the 
small mass difference between groups in the post-amphetamine scans may have influenced 
our results, we performed simulations that show this mass difference would have negligible 
effect on ΔBPND (see supplement). A related phenomenon is the likelihood that tracer dose 
(peak radiotracer receptor occupancy ≤ 5%) is difficult to achieve with [11C]-(+)-PHNO at 
D3 receptors56, 59. This would have little effect on our results in SMST and AST, but may 
have affected ΔBPND in D3-rich regions (however, see simulation results in the supplement). 
This would not, however, explain the different between-group pattern observed across these 
regions, such as large group differences in globus pallidus and negligible differences in the 
thalamus.
It is notable that lower dopamine release in the AST predicted subclinical psychopathology 
in CD, specifically inattention and negative symptoms. CD also scored higher on these 
measures than HC. Although we cannot show a causal relation, these results indicate that 
lower dopamine release may contribute to the negative functional impact of chronic cannabis 
dependence, consistent with a previous finding linking deficits in dopamine release with 
apathy in chronic cannabis users 60. Similarly our findings of an association between 
inattention and lower dopamine release are consistent with previous findings in participant 
with attention deficit disorder in whom inattention was associated with blunted dopamine 
release in striatum61.
We also found that lower dopamine release in the AST correlated with poorer working 
memory performance and probabilistic category learning for both CD and HC. The groups 
did not differ in performance, although poorer working memory performance has been 
described in cannabis abuse 22. Similarly, previous studies found that higher striatal 
dopamine release predicts better working memory performance 23 and probabilistic category 
learning 24. Therefore, our results are consistent with these reports, in suggesting a positive 
relationship between striatal dopamine function and working memory and probabilistic 
category learning, shared across diagnoses, including cannabis use disorder.
Although there is an association between cannabis use and psychosis, we did not observe a 
significant correlation between dopamine release and amphetamine-induced positive 
symptoms. This may be related to the a priori exclusion of subjects with psychiatric 
comorbidities, thereby excluding subjects at high-risk for psychosis.
A limitation of our study is the relatively small sample size, which may have limited our 
ability to report conclusive evidence for smaller and noisier ROIs such as LST or midbrain, 
and may have limited our power for the correlational analyses and to detect alterations in 
MRS measures of glutamate. Unlike the ROI analysis, the voxelwise analysis did not detect 
a significant group difference in pallidus. Small sample size may have contributed to this 
result as ΔBPND values from individual voxels are considerably more variable than averages 
over many voxels in ROIs. Furthermore, it is possible that we did not find associations 
between cannabis use parameters and dopamine release in our sample due to homogeneity of 
van de Giessen et al.

 use severity; pooling our CD samples provides a larger range of frequency of use and 
suggests that such a relationship is likely.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that severe cannabis dependence, with no other 
psychiatric or drug comorbidities, is associated with deficits in amphetamine-induced 
dopamine release in the AST, SMST and globus pallidus. The lower dopamine release in the 
AST might contribute to the association between heavy cannabis use and psychopathology. 
These results are important in light of the steady increase in daily cannabis use in the U.S.62, 
along with continually increasing THC potency and the movement to legalize its use, which 
would expose a wider proportion of the population to the negative impact of cannabis use 
disorder. In particular, as most of our subjects here initiated cannabis use during their 
adolescent years, our study suggests that adolescent use of cannabis leading to dependence 
is associated with a compromised dopaminergic system that may have a negative impact on 
brain function.

 Figure 1. Voxelwise Analysis Comparing ΔBPND between Groups
There were two clusters with significantly different ΔBPND between the CD and HC 
samples (i.e. larger displacement in HC than CD): one in the left putamen, FWE-corrected 
p=0.002, cluster size = 1403 voxels, peak voxel at MNI (−36,−18,2), and one mainly in right 
putamen with some overlap of right precommissural caudate, FWE-corrected p=0.02, cluster 
size = 711 voxels, peak voxel at MNI(40,−2,2). The peak voxel in the left cluster survived 
voxelwise FWE correction (p=0.022) but the right cluster had no single voxels that were 
significant after FWE correction. The color bar shows t21 values.

 Figure 2. Relationships between ΔBPND in the Associative Striatum and Psychopathology and 
Neurocognitive Parameters
Blunted dopamine release in the associative striatum was associated with higher negative 
symptoms (A) and inattention symptoms (B) in CD and with poor probabilistic category 
learning (C) and working memory (D) performance in all participants. Clinical and cognitive 
measures were the dependent variable in regression analyses. β values relating dopamine 
release to clinical (A, B) and cognitive (C, D) measures had p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively. 
AHR = adjusted hit rate, PC learning = probabilistic category learning.

 Figure 3. Cannabis Use and ΔBPND in the Associative Striatum (Normalized to HC Means)
To compare between the current study and the earlier Urban et al. (2012) study 15, taking 
into account the globally different magnitude of ΔBPND between [11C]raclopride and [11C]-
(+)-PHNO, the distance of AST ΔBPND in CD relative to the mean ΔBPND of the HC in 
each study is expressed in standard deviation units. Here, cannabis use frequency in days per 
month is plotted against this normalized ΔBPND to demonstrate the relationship between 
severity of use and amphetamine-induced dopamine release. ΔBPND = 0 represents the HC 
mean from each study.
