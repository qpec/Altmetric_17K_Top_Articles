A
ntibiotic use is common in the inpatient setting.
Approximately 50% of hospitalized patients receive at
least 1 antibiotic during their hospital stay,1 with an es-
timated20%to30%ofinpatientdaysofantibiotictherapycon-
sidered unnecessary.2-6 The reasons for antibiotic overuse are
myriad, including administration of antibiotics for nonbacte-
rial or noninfectious syndromes, treatment of conditions
caused by colonizing or contaminating organisms, and dura-
tions of therapy that are longer than indicated. Unnecessary
use of antibiotics is particularly concerning because antibiot-
ics may be associated with a number of adverse drug events
(ADEs), including allergic reactions, end-organ toxic effects,
subsequent infection with antibiotic-resistant organisms, and
Clostridium difficile infections (CDIs).7-12
Estimates of the incidence of antibiotic-associated ADEs
in hospitalized patients are generally unavailable. Previ-
ously,Shehabandcolleagues13conductedaretrospectiveanaly-
sis of ADEs among patients presenting to emergency depart-
ments and found that antibiotics were implicated in 19% of all
emergency department visits for ADEs. It is unclear whether
these data are generalizable to hospitalized patients for a num-
ber of reasons: (1) acutely ill hospitalized patients may be pre-
disposed to certain ADEs, such as antibiotic-associated neph-
rotoxic effects, particularly those admitted with acute renal
IMPORTANCE Estimates of the incidence of overall antibiotic-associated adverse drug events
(ADEs) in hospitalized patients are generally unavailable.
OBJECTIVE To describe the incidence of antibiotic-associated ADEs for adult inpatients
receiving systemic antibiotic therapy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort of adult inpatients admitted to
general medicine wards at an academic medical center.
EXPOSURES At least 24 hours of any parenteral or oral antibiotic therapy.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Medical records of 1488 patients were examined for 30
days after antibiotic initiation for the development of the following antibiotic-associated
ADEs: gastrointestinal, dermatologic, musculoskeletal, hematologic, hepatobiliary, renal,
cardiac, and neurologic; and 90 days for the development of Clostridium difficile infection or
incident multidrug-resistant organism infection, based on adjudication by 2 infectious
diseases trained clinicians.
RESULTS In 1488 patients, the median age was 59 years (interquartile range, 49-69 years),
and 758 (51%) participants were female. A total of 298 (20%) patients experienced at least
1 antibiotic-associated ADE. Furthermore, 56 (20%) non–clinically indicated antibiotic
regimens were associated with an ADE, including 7 cases of C difficile infection. Every
additional 10 days of antibiotic therapy conferred a 3% increased risk of an ADE. The most
common ADEs were gastrointestinal, renal, and hematologic abnormalities, accounting for 78
(42%), 45 (24%), and 28 (15%) 30-day ADEs, respectively. Notable differences were
identified between the incidence of ADEs associated with specific antibiotics.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although antibiotics may play a critical role when used
appropriately, our findings underscore the importance of judicious antibiotic prescribing to
reduce the harm that can result from antibiotic-associated ADEs.

 failure for non–antibiotic-related reasons; (2) hospitalized pa-
tients are frequently administered intravenous antibiotic
therapy, often at high doses, which may have different ad-
verse event profiles than the oral regimens more commonly
prescribed in the outpatient setting14; (3) hospitalized pa-
tients are commonly administered multiple medications con-
currently, causing a potentially synergistic increase in the risk
of ADE development15; and (4) hospitalized patients are more
likely to be elderly or have multiple medical conditions, re-
sulting in impaired drug elimination and an increased risk of
ADE development.16,17 Previous studies evaluating antibiotic-
associated ADEs in the inpatient setting have used adminis-
trative databases and have not accounted for antibiotic-
associated ADEs that occurred after hospital discharge.18,19
Additionally, they have limited their evaluation of ADEs to
single antibiotic classes or single infectious syndromes.18-21 A
comparativeanalysisoftheincidenceofADEsacrossallclasses
of antibiotics has yet to be performed. Therefore, in the pre-
sent study, we sought to describe the incidence of antibiotic-
associated ADEs for adult inpatients receiving systemic anti-
biotic therapy while hospitalized in general medicine wards.
Methods
Setting and Patients
ThisstudywasconductedattheJohnsHopkinsHospital,a1194-
bedtertiarycarefacilityinBaltimore,Maryland.Thisstudywas
approved by the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine
Institutional Review Board, with a waiver of informed consent
due to the retrospective nature of the study. The data were ret-
rospectively collected on patients 18 years and older admitted
to 4 general medicine services between September 2013 and
June 2014.6 All patients who received antibiotics for at least 24
hours were included. Exclusion criteria included prophylactic
antibioticusewithnoclearstopdates,antibioticsusedfornon-
infectious indications (eg, rifaximin for hepatic encephalopa-
thy, erythromycin for intestinal motility), topical or inhaled
antibiotics, and antituberculosis regimens.
Data Collection and Definitions
Demographic data, preexisting medical conditions, antibi-
oticregimens,andADEswerecollectedviapatientmedicalrec-
ordreview.Bothinpatientandoutpatientmedicalrecordswere
reviewed to obtain follow-up data for patients in the Johns
Hopkins Health System. In addition, the Epic Care Everywhere
Network, a secure health information exchange, was ac-
cessed to view patient data from a large number of health care
facilitiesthroughouttheUnitedStates.22Thisenabledtheiden-
tification of patients presenting to outside emergency depart-
ments, hospitals, or primary care clinics with antibiotic-
associated ADEs, if these facilities were in the Epic system.
All antibiotic regimens were adjudicated for appropriate-
ness and associated ADEs by at least 2 infectious diseases phy-
sicians or pharmacists (P.D.T., E.A., K.D., and S.E.C.). Days of
therapy (DOTs) were defined as the number of days from
antibiotic initiation until the completion of antibiotic courses.
A single DOT was recorded for each individual antibiotic
administered to a patient on a given calendar day. Unneces-
sary antibiotic days were defined as DOTs that were not clini-
cally indicated based on recommendations in the Johns
Hopkins Hospital Antibiotic Guidelines.23 For calculations of
overall rates of ADEs, the denominator included all patients
receiving antibiotics (n = 1488). For calculations involving a
single antibiotic, the denominator included only patients
receiving that particular antibiotic.
Avoidable ADEs were defined as the proportion of overall
ADEsthatoccurredinpatientsforwhomantibiotictherapywas
considerednotindicated.Nonindicatedantibioticregimensdid
not include patients with prolonged durations of therapy be-
cause our goal was to determine the incidence of adverse re-
actions for patients for whom no antibiotic therapy was nec-
essary. For example, if a patient received ciprofloxacin for 15
days for pyelonephritis when 7 days would have been suffi-
cientandthepatientdevelopedtendinitisonday16,onewould
be unable to attribute the adverse event to the 7 indicated days
of ciprofloxacin use or the additional 8 days of unnecessary
ciprofloxacin use. We also did not consider overly broad spec-
trum antibiotic therapy prescribed for valid indications as not
indicated because of the impossibility of knowing whether the
patient would or would not have developed an ADE with a nar-
rower choice, particularly in the same class of antibiotics.
Criteria used to define antibiotic-associated ADEs are sum-
marized in Table 1. These definitions were derived from avail-
ableliterature,packageinserts,and/orconsensusopinionsprior
toanydatacollectionrelatedtothepresentwork.Patientswere
observed for 30 days from the date of antibiotic initiation for
most ADEs (gastrointestinal, dermatologic, musculoskeletal,
hematologic, hepatobiliary, renal, cardiac, and neurologic
events) and for 90 days from the date of antibiotic initiation
for CDI and the development of multidrug-resistant organ-
ism(MDRO)infectionsnotpreviouslyidentified.AllADEsother
thanCDIorincidentMDROinfectionswerecensoredat30days
due to concerns for underestimating the incidence if a longer
evaluation period was used because these ADEs generally
occurduringexposuretoparticularantibioticsorshortlythere-
after. In contrast, data suggest that CDI and the emergence of
MDROinfectionscanbecomeclinicallyapparentseveralweeks
to months after discontinuing antibiotic therapy.26,27
Key Points
Question What is the likelihood of developing antibiotic-
associated adverse drug events (ADEs) for hospitalized patients
receiving antibiotic therapy?
Findings In this cohort study, medical records of 1488 adult
inpatients were examined for 30 days after antibiotic initiation for
the development of the following antibiotic-associated ADEs:
gastrointestinal, dermatologic, musculoskeletal, hematologic,
hepatobiliary, renal, cardiac, and neurologic; and 90 days for the
development of Clostridium difficile infection or incident
multidrug-resistant organism infection. Twenty percent of patients
experienced at least 1 antibiotic-associated ADE.
Meaning These findings underscore the importance of judicious
antibiotic prescribing to reduce the harm that can result from
antibiotic-associated ADEs.

ceivedmultipleantibioticsduringtheirhospitalstays.However,
becausevirtuallyallantibioticscancauseCDIortheemergence
of MDRO infections, the development of either of these 90-day
ADEs was attributed to all preceding antibiotic used.
Statistical Analysis
Rates per 10 000 person-days and 95% confidence intervals
were calculated for each ADE and antibiotic class. For 30-day
ADEs, the numerator was the number of ADEs attributed to
each antibiotic or class of antibiotics. The denominator was the
person-time at risk for all patients who received that particu-
lar antibiotic or class of antibiotics, computed as the time, in
days, from antibiotic initiation to the ADE for patients who ex-
perienced the ADE, with censoring at 30 days for patients who
did not experience the ADE. The proportion of 30-day anti-
biotic-associated ADEs per antibiotic or antibiotic class and the
proportion of patients receiving a particular antibiotic or
antibiotic class who developed a 30-day ADE were also calcu-
lated. For 90-day ADEs, the numerator accounted for all pre-
ceding antibiotics rather than only a single antibiotic. The de-
nominator was the person-time at risk for all patients who
received antibiotics, computed as the time, in days, from
antibiotic initiation to ADE onset, with censoring at 90 days.
Hazard ratios were calculated to identify the incremental risk
of an ADE conferred by each additional day of antibiotic use.
All analyses were performed using Stata 13 (StataCorp).
Results
Antibiotic Regimens
Ofthe5579patientsadmittedtothe4includedmedicinewards
during the study period, 1488 (27%) patients received anti-
biotics for at least 24 hours and were included in the analysis.
Previous work describes the demographic data, preexisting
medical conditions, sources of infection, and “appropriate-
ness” of antibiotic use of the included population in more
detail.6 In brief, the median age was 59 years (interquartile
range [IQR], 49-69 years) and 758 (51%) participants were
female.Themostcommonunderlyingmedicalconditionswere
diabetes (491 [33%]), structural lung disease (327 [22%]), and
congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of less than
40% (178 [12%]). The median length of hospital stay was 4 days
(IQR, 2-9 days). The most common indications for antibiotic
therapy were urinary tract infections (179 [12%]), skin and
soft-tissue infections (119 [8%]), and community-acquired
pneumonia (104 [7%]).

 The most frequently prescribed antibiotics were third-
generation cephalosporins (607 [41%] regimens), parenteral
vancomycin (544 [37%] regimens), and cefepime (414 [28%]
regimens) (Table 2). The majority of patients (1176 [79%]) re-
ceived more than 1 antibiotic during the hospitalization. The
median DOTs per patient was 7 days (IQR, 4-14 days). A total
of 324 unique ADEs occurred; 298 (20%) patients experi-
enced at least 1 antibiotic-associated ADE. The overall rate of
antibiotic-associated ADEs was 22.9 per 10 000 person-days.
Every additional 10 antibiotic DOTs conferred a 3%
increased risk of an ADE. A total of 236 (73%) antibiotic-
associated ADEs occurred during hospitalization and the re-
maining 88 (27%) occurred after hospital discharge including
33 (18%) 30-day ADEs, 11 (20%) CDIs, and 44 (52%) MDRO in-
fections. The study investigators determined that 287 (19%)
of antibiotic regimens were not clinically indicated, most com-
monly because of treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria or
treatment of noninfectious lower respiratory tract conditions
(eg, aspiration pneumonitis, congestive heart failure).6 Of the
287 nonindicated antibiotic regimens, 56 (20%) were associ-
ated with an ADE.
30-Day ADEs
Of the 324 overall ADEs, 186 (57%) were 30-day ADEs. The me-
dian time to development of a 30-day ADE was 5 days (IQR,
3-8 days). The median times to 30-day ADEs for the various
organsystemswereasfollows:cardiac,11days(IQR,4-18days);
gastrointestinal, 5 days (IQR, 2-9 days); hematologic, 12 days
(IQR, 6-24 days); hepatobiliary, 8 days (IQR, 4-12 days); renal,
5 days (IQR, 2-10 days); and neurologic, 3 days (IQR, 2-4 days).
The most common ADEs were gastrointestinal, renal, and he-
matologic abnormalities, accounting for 78 (42%), 45 (24%),
and 28 (15%) 30-day ADEs, respectively (Table 2). Table 3 and
Table 4 outline the proportions of 30-day ADEs attributable
to specific antibiotics or antibiotic classes and the proportion
of patients receiving a specific antibiotic or antibiotic class who
developed 30-day ADEs, respectively.
Aminoglycosides, parenteral vancomycin, and trimetho-
prim-sulfamethoxazole were associated with the highest rates
of nephrotoxic effects at 21.2 (95% CI, 12.5-66.0), 12.1 (95% CI,
7.7-19.0), and 13.2 (95% CI, 5.9-29.3) episodes per 10 000 per-
son-days,respectively(Table2).TwopatientsexperiencedQTc
prolongation—1 receiving azithromycin and 1 receiving cipro-
floxacin after 4 and 18 days of therapy, respectively. Seven pa-
tients (6.7 [95% CI, 2.7-12.0] episodes per 10 000 person-
days) receiving cefepime developed neurotoxic effects,
including encephalopathy or seizures. Less frequent 30-day
ADEs, all occurring in single patients, included cefepime-
associated anaphylaxis, piperacillin-tazobactam–associated
drug fever, daptomycin-associated myositis, ciprofloxacin-
associated tendinitis, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole–
associated pancreatitis, linezolid-associated peripheral
neuropathy,vancomycin-associatedhives,andatrimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole–associated nonhives rash.
90-Day ADEs
There were 138 ADEs occurring within 90 days, accounting for
43% of all ADEs. Of these 138 ADEs, 54 (39%) were CDI and 84
(61%) were MDRO infections. The median time to develop-
ment of a 90-day ADE was 15 days (IQR, 4-34 days). The rate
of CDI was 3.9 (95% CI, 3.0-5.2) per 10 000 person-days for pa-
tients receiving antibiotics, corresponding to 54 (4%) study pa-
tients developing CDI within 90 days of antibiotic initiation.
TheantibioticsmostfrequentlyassociatedwithCDIwerethird-
generation cephalosporins (present in 28 [52%] regimens pre-
ceding CDI), cefepime (26 [48%] regimens), and fluoroquino-
lones (19 [35%] regimens).
The rate of emergence of incident MDRO infections was
6.1 (95% CI, 4.9-7.6) per 10 000 person-days, corresponding
to 84 [6%] study patients developing an infection with a new
MDROwithin90daysofantibioticinitiation.Subsequentgram-
positive resistance was observed in 60 (4%) patients, at a rate
of 4.8 (95% CI, 3.7-6.1) cases per 10 000 person-days. Forty
(67%) of the MDRO cases were related to vancomycin-
resistant enterococci infections. Gram-negative resistance
occurred less frequently at a rate of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.2-2.6) cases
per 10 000 person-days, or in 30 (2%) patients, with extended-
spectrum β-lactamase production being the most common
resistance mechanism identified.
Clinically Significant ADEs
Antibiotic-associated ADEs were then categorized into clini-
cally significant and non–clinically significant categories. Only
1 category was selected per patient, with the more severe cat-
egory selected when multiple categories were met. A total of
314 (97%) of the 324 antibiotic-associated ADEs were consid-
eredclinicallysignificantbecauseofthefollowingreasons:new
hospitalization(s) (n = 10 [3%]), prolonged hospitalization
(n = 77 [24%]), additional clinic or emergency department vis-
its (n = 29 [9%]), and additional laboratory tests, electrocar-
diograms, or imaging (n = 198 [61%]). There were no deaths
attributable to any antibiotic-associated ADE.
Discussion
We found that 20% of hospitalized patients receiving at least
24 hours of antibiotic therapy developed an antibiotic-
associated ADE. Moreover, 20% of ADEs were attributable to
antibiotics prescribed for conditions for which antibiotics were
not indicated. Every 10 DOTs conferred an additional 3% risk
of an ADE. Our findings underscore the importance of avoid-
ing unnecessary antibiotic prescribing to reduce the harm that
can result from antibiotic-associated ADEs.
Previous studies on antibiotic-associated ADEs in the in-
patient setting have largely been limited to single infectious
syndromes or single antibiotic classes.18-21,28 For example, Lin
and colleagues18 evaluated the incidence of antibiotic-
associated ADEs using an administrative database of hospi-
talizedpatientswithpneumonia.Theyfoundthateventhough
less than 1% of patients developed ADEs, the presence of an
antibiotic-associated ADE was an independent predictor of
prolonged hospital lengths of stay and total hospital charges.
Werner et al20 evaluated the frequency of adverse events re-
lated to unnecessary fluoroquinolone use in hospitalized
patients based on medical record review. They found that

 approximately 40% of days of fluoroquinolone therapy were
unnecessary and 27% of regimens were associated with ad-
verse events including gastrointestinal events (14%), MDRO
colonization (8%), and CDI (4%). Finally, Macy and Contreras19
evaluated the incidence of cephalosporin-associated ADEs
using an administrative database and found that the most
frequently reported serious ADEs were CDI, occurring in ap-
proximately 1% of patients.
We believe that our study enhances these investigations
in a number of ways. First, unlike previous studies, we evalu-
ated antibiotic-associated ADEs that occurred in both the in-
patient setting as well as the outpatient setting after hospital
discharge, enabling us to produce a more global picture of the
overall incidence of antibiotic-associated ADEs.13,18,19,29 Our
previous work suggests that approximately 40% of antibiot-
ics prescribed for hospitalized patients represent antibiotics
prescribed at the time of hospital discharge that are to be con-
tinued after leaving the hospital.6 We believe that it is impor-
tant to include these antibiotic days in estimates of antibiotic-
associated adverse events for hospitalized patients. Second,
in our cohort, infectious diseases physicians and pharma-
cists reviewed all patient medical records to identify ADEs and
to determine whether they were most likely attributable to re-
cent or current antibiotic use using strict, predefined criteria.
In contrast, previous studies have generally used administra-
tive databases, in which relevant events are commonly mis-
coded and through which attributable risk cannot always be
assigned.13,18 Furthermore, we did not limit our evaluation to
specific antibiotic classes but, rather, included all antibiotic
classes.
Limitations
Our study has a number of limitations. This was a single-
center study at an academic hospital with a medically com-
plex patient population. Replication of our results at other in-
stitutions and in other patient populations is necessary to

 enhance the generalizability of our findings. This would also
allow for ADE estimates for antibiotic agents not included on
our hospital formulary. Furthermore, because prescriptions of
some antibiotics were so infrequent (eg, penicillin, ceftaro-
line fosamil, tigecycline), accurate estimates of some drug-
specific ADEs could not be calculated. Our approximations of
antibiotic-associated ADEs are likely underestimations for a
number of reasons. First, our hospital has had a robust anti-
biotic stewardship program since 2002 that remained active
during the study period, likely reducing overall antibiotic pre-
scriptions, durations of antibiotic therapy, and consequently
antibiotic-associated ADEs. Second, we were unable to evalu-
ate data from patients who had follow-up medical care out-
sidetheEpicCareEverywherenetwork,forexamplethosewho
presented to primary care clinicians, emergency depart-
ments, or urgent care centers not using the Epic electronic
medical record system.22 Of note, only 119 (8%) patients were
considered lost to follow-up with no subsequent inpatient or
outpatientvisitsdocumentedintheEpicCareEverywherenet-
work. Additionally, it is plausible that a portion of patients in
thiscohortmayhavepreviouslyexperiencedseriousantibiotic-
associated ADEs, leading to future avoidance of these agents
(eg, hives from penicillin use as a child), also potentially
underestimating the incidence of antibiotic-associated ADEs.
Finally, we did not include excessively prolonged durations of
antibiotic therapy or inappropriately broad antibiotic use
towardourcalculationofavoidableantibiotic-associatedADEs,
likely underestimating this value.
Conclusions
In summary, antibiotic-associated ADEs are common among
inpatients receiving antibiotics, some of which may be avoid-
able with more judicious use of antibiotics. The frequency of
antibiotic-associated ADEs may not be recognized by clini-
