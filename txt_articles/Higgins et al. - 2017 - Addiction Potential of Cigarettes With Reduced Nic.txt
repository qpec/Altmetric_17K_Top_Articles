IMPORTANCE A national policy is under consideration to reduce the nicotine content of
cigarettes to lower nicotine addiction potential in the United States.
OBJECTIVE To examine how smokers with psychiatric disorders and other vulnerabilities to
tobacco addiction respond to cigarettes with reduced nicotine content.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A multisite, double-blind, within-participant assessment
of acute response to research cigarettes with nicotine content ranging from levels below a
hypothesized addiction threshold to those representative of commercial cigarettes (0.4, 2.3,
5.2, and 15.8 mg/g of tobacco) at 3 academic sites included 169 daily smokers from the
following 3 vulnerable populations: individuals with affective disorders (n = 56) or opioid
dependence (n = 60) and socioeconomically disadvantaged women (n = 53). Data were
collected from March 23, 2015, through April 25, 2016.
INTERVENTIONS After a brief smoking abstinence, participants were exposed to the
cigarettes with varying nicotine doses across fourteen 2- to 4-hour outpatient sessions.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Addiction potential of the cigarettes was assessed using
concurrent choice testing, the Cigarette Purchase Task (CPT), and validated measures of
subjective effects, such as the Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale.
RESULTS Among the 169 daily smokers included in the analysis (120 women [71.0%] and 49
men [29.0%]; mean [SD] age, 35.6 [11.4] years), reducing the nicotine content of cigarettes
decreased the relative reinforcing effects of smoking in all 3 populations. Across populations,
the 0.4-mg/g dose was chosen significantly less than the 15.8-mg/g dose in concurrent choice
testing (mean [SEM] 30% [0.04%] vs 70% [0.04%]; Cohen d = 0.40; P < .001) and
generated lower demand in the CPT (α = .027 [95% CI, 0.023-0.031] vs α = .019 [95% CI,
0.016-0.022]; Cohen d = 1.17; P < .001). Preference for higher over lower nicotine content
cigarettes could be reversed by increasing the response cost necessary to obtain the higher
dose (mean [SEM], 61% [0.02%] vs 39% [0.02%]; Cohen d = 0.40; P < .001). All doses
reduced Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale total scores (range of mean decreases,
0.10-0.50; Cohen d range, 0.21-1.05; P < .001 for all), although duration of withdrawal
symptoms was greater at higher doses (η2 = 0.008; dose-by-time interaction, P = .002).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Reducing the nicotine content of cigarettes may decrease
their addiction potential in populations that are highly vulnerable to tobacco addiction.
Smokers with psychiatric conditions and socioeconomic disadvantage are more addicted and
less likely to quit and experience greater adverse health impacts. Policies to reduce these
disparities are needed; reducing the nicotine content in cigarettes should be a policy focus.

igarette smoking is a public health burden that espe-
ciallyharmsindividualswithpsychiatricconditionsand
socioeconomic disadvantage and is a major contribu-
tor to health disparities.1-5 Reducing this burden will require
tobacco control and regulatory policies that are more effec-
tive at changing behavior in these vulnerable populations.6
The present study investigates how vulnerable popula-
tionsofsmokersmayrespondtoanationalUSregulatorypolicy
to reduce the maximal nicotine content of cigarettes and
thereby lower their potential to cause addiction. The 2009
FamilySmokingPreventionandTobaccoControlAct(FSPTCA)
granted the US Food and Drug Administration regulatory au-
thority over cigarettes and other tobacco products.7 That leg-
islationincludesauthoritytoreducethemaximalnicotinecon-
tentofcigarettesifdoingsobenefitspublichealth.Aregulatory
question fundamental to protecting public health is whether
the nicotine content of cigarettes can be set below a thresh-
old dose necessary to produce or sustain addiction. This would
allow current smokers to make more rational choices about
continuingtosmokewhileloweringaddictionriskamongthose
newly introduced to smoking.
Benowitz and Henningfield8 introduced the idea of de-
creasing nicotine content more than 20 years ago, hypothesiz-
ing that the threshold nicotine dose for reinforcing effects, a
primary indicator of addiction potential, was approximately
0.7 mg/g of tobacco. A series of studies9-12 in relatively healthy
smokers conducted since the passage of the FSPTCA support
thepositionthatreducingnicotinecontentincigarettestovery
low levels reduces addiction potential. Moreover, cigarettes
withreducednicotinecontentappeartoproduceminimalcom-
pensatory smoking (ie, adjustments in smoking amount or to-
pography to sustain desired nicotine blood levels).9-12 Com-
pensatory smoking was the major limitation in prior efforts to
use light cigarettes to reduce addiction potential13 that at-
tempted to reduce nicotine yield through filter ventilation but
left the nicotine content unchanged.
Initial studies of cigarettes with reduced nicotine content
wereappropriatelyconductedwithpsychiatricallyandsocioeco-
nomically stable, healthy smokers. However, smoking is over-
representedamongthosewithpsychiatricconditionsandsocio-
economicdisadvantage,amongothervulnerabilities.1-6,14,15Thus,
we studied 3 adult populations that are particularly vulnerable
to tobacco addiction and its adverse health impacts: individu-
alswithaffectivedisorderstorepresentsmokerswithmentalill-
ness,individualswithopioiddependencetorepresentsmokers

adult population (21.0%; 95% CI, 20.4%-21.6%), with rates of
32.2%(95%CI,30.3%-34.1%)amongthosewithaffectivedisor-
ders, 92.2% (95% CI, 86.5%-97.9%) among those with opioid
(heroin)dependence,and29.5%(95%CI,28.0%-31.0%)among
disadvantaged women of reproductive age.17
How smokers with comorbid psychiatric conditions or
lower socioeconomic status respond to cigarettes with re-
ducednicotinecontenthasnotbeenwellstudied.Severalsmall
studies involving these vulnerable populations suggest that
cigarettes with very low nicotine content reduce abstinence-
induced withdrawal without engendering compensatory
smoking.18-21 Results from a single pilot study21 suggest that
reducing the nicotine content decreases the addiction poten-
tial of smoking among individuals with psychiatric condi-
tions or socioeconomic disadvantage, but a small sample size
precluded thoroughly examining the nicotine dose or popu-
lation differences. Another study22 demonstrated that el-
evated depressive symptoms did not moderate response to re-
duced nicotine content cigarettes, although this was not in a
clinicallydiagnosedsample.Thecurrentstudyis,toourknowl-
edge, the first large, controlled study to examine the dose-
dependent effects of cigarettes with reduced nicotine con-
tent on the reinforcing effects, subjective effects, and smoking
topography in vulnerable populations.
Methods
Study Sample
Participating adult daily smokers included 56 with affective
disorders, 60 with opioid dependence, and 53 socioeconomi-
cally disadvantaged women (Table 1). Inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria are described in eMethods in the Supplement. The
institutional review boards at the University of Vermont, Bur-
lington;BrownUniversity,Providence,RhodeIsland;andJohns
Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Mary-
land, approved the study. All participants provided written in-
formed consent.
Procedure
Data were collected from March 23, 2015, through April 25,
2016. Participants completed fourteen 2- to 4-hour experi-
mental sessions in a within-participant design (eMethods in
the Supplement provides additional details). Participants ab-
stained from smoking for 6 to 8 hours before the sessions. Ses-
sions were organized into 3 phases.
In phase 1 (sessions 1-5), participants sampled the re-
search cigarettes under double-blind conditions. Partici-
pants were oriented to the research protocol in session 1 using
Key Points
Question Would a national policy of reducing the nicotine content
of cigarettes alter the addiction potential of smoking among adults
with psychiatric disorders or other vulnerabilities to tobacco
addiction?
Findings In this multisite, double-blind, within-participant
assessment of 169 adult smokers, the addiction potential of
smoking was reduced by lowering the nicotine content of
cigarettes to very low levels.
Meaning A national tobacco regulatory policy that reduces the
maximal nicotine content of cigarettes to low levels may help
reduce smoking in populations that are highly vulnerable to
tobacco addiction.

 their usual-brand cigarette. In sessions 2 to 5, participants
smoked 1 research cigarette per session. The research ciga-
rettes were identical in appearance but varied in nicotine con-
tent (15.8, 5.2, 2.4, and 0.4 mg/g; Spectrum cigarettes, 22nd
Century Group, Inc). The highest dose served as a control for
nicotine levels typical of commercial cigarettes, whereas the
lowest dose represents a dose below the hypothesized
0.7-mg/g threshold dose for addiction. Participants were in-
structed to smoke the research cigarettes as usual but used a
plastic cigarette holder connected to a device that recorded
smoking topography.23 After smoking the assigned cigarette
each session, participants completed the Cigarette Purchase
Task(CPT),whichisabehavioraleconomicsimulationtaskthat
models (1) cigarette smoking rate when unconstrained by cost,
(2) maximal amount of money that an individual is willing to
spend on daily smoking, (3) the price at which the smoking rate
begins decreasing proportionate to increasing price, (4) the
price at which an individual would quit smoking rather than
incur the cost, and (5) overall sensitivity of smoking rate to
price.24-26Inaddition,themodifiedCigaretteEvaluationQues-
tionnaire (mCEQ),27 Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Ques-

Phase 2 (sessions 6-11) directly tested the relative reinforc-
ing effects of the different doses in the cigarettes by allowing
participants to choose which cigarette they preferred to
smoke.31,32 Each of the 6 possible cigarette dose-pair combi-
nations was tested once in separate sessions. In these 3-hour
sessions, a participant sat alone in a comfortable, ventilated
room with reading materials (eFigure 1 in the Supplement).
When they wished to smoke, they used a computer mouse to
click on 1 of 2 icons on a screen representing the 2 cigarettes
available that session. After 10 clicks on the icon, they could
take 2 puffs of the associated cigarette.31 Participants were free
to choose either option as often as they wished or to abstain.

Participants were informed of the different response require-
ments in advance. Participants completed the CPT for the 0.4-
and15.8-mg/gdosesaftertheconcurrentchoicesessionsinphase
3 to assess relative demand for the 2 cigarettes outside the con-
current choice test arrangement.
Statistical Methods
Analyses of phase 1 results examined differences between the
research cigarettes on the CPT and mCEQ and smoking topog-
raphy by using repeated-measures analysis of variance, with
nicotinedoseasthewithin-participantfactor.TheMNWS,QSU-
Brief, and breath levels of carbon monoxide (CO) boost were
examinedsimilarlywithtimeasanotherwithin-participantfac-
tor. To measure CO boost, presmoking CO values were sub-
tracted from postsmoking CO values. Analyses also included
a fixed effect for session. Time-by-dose interactions were in-
cluded to test whether the CO boost or subjective effects be-
fore and after smoking differed by dose; when not signifi-
cant, interaction effects were dropped from the models.
Because the research cigarettes were presented in random

Differences in preference among all possible dose pairs (phase

variance, with each pairwise combination as the within-
participantfactor.Significantdose-paireffectswerefollowedwith
post hoc testing. Differences among participants in preference
for the highest- vs lowest-dose cigarettes (phase 3) were exam-
ined using a repeated-measures analysis of variance, with ses-
sion as the repeating factor and population as the between-
subjects factor. Effect sizes were computed using the Cohen d
forpairwisecomparisonsandη2valueforinteractioneffects.Ex-
ploratoryanalysesexaminingpossiblemoderatingeffectsofsex
andcigarettementholationstatuswereconductedwith2primary
outcome measures (concurrent choice and mCEQ). To describe
aggregate-level cigarette demand on the CPT, we fit a demand
curve34tomeanreportedconsumptionateachpriceacrosspar-
ticipants and doses. An extra sum-of-squares F test evaluated
whetherdemandinelasticitydifferedsignificantlyacrossdoses;
thistestwasalsousedtocompareaggregatedosecurvesacross
populations and sessions.
To quantify participant-level CPT demand elasticity, a de-
mand curve was fit to individual consumption at each price
for each dose. When fitting demand curves, we constrained
demand intensity to the participants’reported consumption
at $0.00 to leave elasticity as the only fitted parameter. Elas-
ticity values greater than 1.00 were winsorized to 1.00 before
statistical analysis (22 of 845 cases). All other demand indi-
ces were empirically quantified from observed values. Maxi-
malexpenditure,maximalprice,breakpoint,andαvalueswere
log10 transformed to correct for skewness. We reviewed CPT
results and found systematic patterns35 in 92.7% of demand
curves; no data were excluded from analyses. In cases in which
participantsreportedzeroconsumptionacrossallprices,curve
fitting was not possible; thus, elasticity was not analyzed and
other demand indices were quantified as 0.
Data were complete for all but the MNWS, QSU-Brief, and
smoking topography measures. Missing data for topography
measures amounted to 3% or less, whereas missing data for
the other measures was limited to at most 2 missing observa-
tions per session. All analyses were completed using maxi-
mumlikelihoodestimationprocedures.Significanceforalltests
was P < .05. Post hoc testing was based on unpaired t tests (be-
tween participants) or paired t tests (within participant). All
were 2-tailed, with P values for post hoc tests subject to
Bonferroni correction.
Results
Direct Testing
Onehundredsixty-ninedailysmokers(120women[71.0%]and
49 men [29.0%]; mean [SD] age, 35.6 [11.4] years) were in-
cluded in the analyses. In concurrent choice testing with the
cigarettes available at an equal response effort, participants
chose those with higher compared with lower nicotine con-
tent across each of the 6 dose pairs, a finding consistent with
cigarettes with reduced nicotine content having lower addic-
tion potential (t159>2.96; P < .008) (Figure 1A). The only dif-
ference between populations (F2,154 = 3.27; P = .04) in that re-
gard was at the 0.4- vs 2.4-mg/g dose pair, at which smokers
with affective disorders chose the higher dose more fre-
quently (t154 = 3.46; P < .001), whereas disadvantaged women
(t154 = 1.92; P = .06) and participants with opioid depen-
dence (t154 = 0.11; P = .91) did not exhibit a significant prefer-
ence between those 2 doses (eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
When concurrent choice testing in phase 3 involved a
greater effort to obtain the cigarette with the highest vs low-
estnicotinecontentcigarette(15.8vs0.4mg/g),preferencewas
reversed from that when those same doses were available at
equal response effort (Figure 1B). Participants more fre-
quently chose to smoke the cigarette with the 0.4-mg/g dose
thanthecigarettewiththe15.8-mg/gdose(t160 = 4.73;P < .001),
with no differences across sessions (F2,293 = 0.03; P = .78) or
populations (F2,160 = 0.41; P = .67). We found no significant in-
teractionsofdoseandsexorcigarettementholationstatuswith
choice between dose pairs (F5,831≤1.86; P ≥ .05).

 Significant effects of nicotine dose were also observed
across 4 of the 5 CPT indices, including the number of ciga-
rettes that participants estimated smoking per day if ciga-
rettes were free of cost (demand intensity) (Figure 2B), how
much they were willing to spend daily on smoking (maxi-
mum expenditure) (Figure 2C), price at which the smoking rate
began to decrease proportionate to increasing price (maxi-
mum price) (Figure 2D), and of particular relevance to addic-
tion potential, the price at which participants indicated they
would quit smoking rather than incur the cost (breakpoint)
(Figure 2E) (F3,484≥5.38; P ≤ .001). Overall sensitivity to price
did not increase significantly as nicotine dose decreased
(F3,437 = 2.62; P = .05) (Figure 2F). The only effect of popula-
tion(F2,97 = 5.02;P = .008)acrossthese5indiceswaswithciga-
rettes smoked per day if free of cost (demand intensity) (eFig-
ure 3B in the Supplement), with greater smoking among those
withopioiddependencecomparedwithdisadvantagedwomen
(t163 = 3.02; P = .009). We found no significant interactions be-
tween nicotine dose and population (F6,484≤0.98; P > .05). A
small proportion of participants reported zero demand across
all prices that varied by dose for 0.04 mg/g (19 of 166 [11.4%]),
2.3 mg/g (10 of 164 [6.1%]), 5.2 mg/g (5 of 165 [3.1%]), and
15.8 mg/g (4 of 166 [2.4%]) (F3,492 = 8.12; P < .001).
The CPT assessments were also completed at the end of
phase 3 sessions. Demand remained higher for the 15.8- vs 0.4-
mg/g dose (F1,38 = 7.45; P = .01) (eFigure 4 in the Supple-
ment), suggesting that the preference reversal observed in the
concurrent choice tests resulted from the greater effort re-
quired to obtain the high dose and not a generalized change
in the relative reinforcing value of the 2 doses. We found no
significant differences across sessions or populations.
Participant Ratings and Compensatory Smoking Measures
In tests of subjective effects, positive ratings of smoking on the
mCEQ decreased as a function of reducing nicotine content, a
finding consistent with reduced addiction potential
(F3,501≥7.08; P < .001) (Table 2); there were no significant in-
teractions between dose and sex or cigarette mentholation sta-
tus (F3,495≤2.33; Ps ≥.05). Each of the doses significantly re-
duced nicotine withdrawal symptoms and craving on the
MNWS (t2016>2.67; P < .001), although duration of effects was
greater at higher doses (Table 3) (dose-by-time interaction;
F12,2014 = 2.64; P = .002). Results of the QSU-Brief are found
in eTable 1 in the Supplement. Only 1 significant difference be-
tween populations was found for the MNWS total score (main
effect; F2,166 = 7.54; P = .001), with symptoms among disad-
vantaged women significantly lower than among individuals
with opioid dependence (t166 = −2.42; P = .02) or affective dis-
orders (t95 = −3.81; P < .001).
No significant changes were noted across doses in smok-
ing topography (eFigure 5 in the Supplement) or breath CO ex-
posure levels (eTable 2 in the Supplement) indicative of com-
pensatory smoking. The results suggest that participants may
smoke the reduced nicotine content cigarettes less intensely.
These effects were consistent across populations.
Discussion
Overall, our results indicate that reducing the nicotine con-
tent of cigarettes reduces the relative reinforcing effects of
smoking and thus addiction potential in populations with
psychiatric conditions and other vulnerabilities to tobacco

 addiction. Although this association was graded with no
clear threshold effect, the 0.4-mg/g dose most consistently
and robustly differed from the 15.8-mg/g control dose, a
finding supporting a prior hypothesis about reducing nico-
tine content below 0.7 mg/g.8 A thresholdlike effect was
reported previously in a trial examining chronic exposure
among more medically and socially stable smokers who
maintained lower rates of smoking at doses of 2.4 mg/g or
less compared with higher doses.12 Whether a similar pat-
tern emerges during extended exposure in more vulnerable
populations should be examined in future studies.
Reductions in reinforcing effects were achieved in the
present study without causing untoward withdrawal, crav-
ing,orcompensatorysmoking.Theconsistencyofeffectsnoted
across the 3 vulnerable populations underscores the general-
ity of these results, especially regarding the control that nico-
tine content exerts over smoker preferences, despite consid-
erable individual differences. Overall, the present findings are
consistent with the lower smoking rates, decreased nicotine
dependence severity, increased quit attempts, and lower in-
tensity of demand observed in clinical trials of cigarettes with
reduced nicotine content among more stable smokers.9-12,36

areas, 95% CI in the best lines. B-F, Data points represent means across
participants; error bars, SEM. Demand intensity indicates estimated
consumption at $0 price (range, 0-100, with higher scores indicating greater

maximal expenditure participants were willing to incur for smoking in 1 day
(range, 0-1600, with higher scores indicating greater expenditure); maximal
price, estimated price at which demand begins to decrease proportional to price
increases (range, 0-40, with higher scores indicating a greater cigarette unit
price associated with unit elasticity for cigarettes); breakpoint, estimated price
at which participants would quit smoking rather than incur its costs (range,
0-60, with higher scores indicating a greater cigarette unit price associated with
discontinuation of smoking); and α, estimated overall sensitivity of demand to
price increases (range, 1.096−20 to 1, with higher scores indicating greater
sensitivity to cigarette unit price increases). Data points not sharing a symbol

 The ability of increased response cost to shift preference to
the0.4-vs15.8-mg/gdose(Figure1B)suggeststhatcigaretteswith
verylownicotinecontentcanserveaseconomicsubstitutesfor
cigaretteswithcommercial-levelnicotinecontentwhenthecost
to obtain the higher-dose products is greater. This observation
is consistent with unit-price models of drug abuse wherein re-
inforcingvaluecorrespondstotheratioofdrugdoseandcost.37,38
This observation has considerable tobacco regulatory implica-
tions. For example, allowing cigarettes with very low nicotine
contenttobesoldincommonretailoutletswhilerestrictingthe
sale of cigarettes with higher nicotine content to less plentiful
or more regulated stores would be predicted to shift preference
toward the former. This same concept may also extend to regu-
latory efforts to shift preference from combusted to less harm-
ful noncombusted tobacco products.
Over time, smokers with comorbid psychiatric condi-
tions and socioeconomic disadvantage have become a larger
proportion of smokers in developed countries, in part be-
cause they are more addicted and thus less likely to try to quit
or to succeed if they try.1-6,14,15 Smoking in these populations
is an important contributor to health disparities.2,3 Thus, it is
important that tobacco control and regulatory policies are de-
veloped that are effective among populations with comorbid
psychiatric conditions and socioeconomic disadvantage.
Limitations
The present study assessed acute response in a laboratory
setting, leaving unanswered whether results can be general-
ized to vulnerable populations with chronic use of cigarettes
with reduced nicotine content in naturalistic settings. That
question can only be answered by field trials in vulnerable
populations, which are under way. The acute laboratory
model was an appropriately safe setting to begin examining
cigarettes with reduced nicotine content in medically and
socially unstable populations. The laboratory models used in
the present study are well-validated methods for assessing
the addiction potential of drugs in naturalistic settings.39,40
Results from prior studies of acute response to cigarettes
with reduced nicotine content in laboratory settings in the
general population of smokers used similar methods,32,41
and results align closely with those seen during chronic
exposure in naturalistic settings.12
Conclusions
Our results suggest that a national regulatory policy reduc-
ing the nicotine content of cigarettes may reduce the addic-
tion potential of cigarettes and that those effects would
extend to populations that are highly vulnerable to tobacco
addiction. In addition, the results suggest how regulatory
policies could potentially shift preferences from more-
to less-harmful tobacco products. Studies of extended
exposure to reduced nicotine content cigarettes and studies
in populations with other psychiatric conditions are
warranted.
