ABSTRACT
Background Evidence on the indirect health impacts of 
disasters is limited. We assessed the excess mortality risk 
associated with the indirect health impacts of the 2011 
triple disaster (earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster) 
in Fukushima, Japan.
Methods The mortality rates in Soma and Minamisoma 
cities in Fukushima from 2006 to 2015 were calculated 
using vital statistics and resident registrations. We 
investigated the excess mortality risk, defined as the 
increased mortality risk between postdisaster and 
predisaster after excluding direct deaths attributed to 
the physical force of the disaster. Multivariate Poisson 
regression models were used to estimate the relative risk 
(RR) of mortality after adjusting for city, age and year.
Results There were 6163 and 6125 predisaster and 
postdisaster deaths, respectively. The postdisaster 
mortality risk was significantly higher in the first 
month following the disaster (March 2011) than in 
the same month during the predisaster period (March 
2006–2010). RRs among men and women were 2.64 
(95% CI 2.16 to 3.24) and 2.46 (95% CI 1.99 to 
3.03), respectively, demonstrating excess mortality 
risk due to the indirect health effects of the disaster. 
Age-specific subgroup analyses revealed a significantly 
higher mortality risk in women aged ≥85 years in the 
third month of the disaster compared with predisaster 
baseline, with an RR (95% CI) of 1.73 (1.23 to 2.44).
Conclusions Indirect health impacts are most severe 
in the first month of the disaster. Early public health 
support, especially for the elderly, can be an important 
factor for reducing the indirect health effects of a 
disaster.
InTRoduCTIon
Unprecedented ageing societies, coupled with 
increasing disaster risks due to climate change 
and political and economic instability,1 2 make the 
management of disaster risk a public health issue 
in terms of prevention, preparation, response, 
recovery and reconstruction.3 This is because the 
elderly are particularly susceptible to health risks 
in disaster settings.4 For example, the elderly often 
face a higher mortality risk than younger popula-
tions in disaster settings, as seen in the Hanshin-
Awaji earthquake and the Chicago heat wave, both 
in 1995.5 In order to develop effective design and 
delivery of public health countermeasures against 
the health impact of disasters in ageing populations, 
it is essential to understand actual health impacts 
and their potential risk factors.6
The Great East Japan Earthquake, ensuing 
tsunami and nuclear disaster (hereinafter referred 
to as the triple disaster), which occurred on 
11 March 2011, is a powerful example of a disaster 
that occurred in a rapidly ageing society. Residents 
of Soma and Minamisoma cities, located around 
10–45 
km north of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear 
Power Plant (see online supplementary figure S1), 
experienced substantial health consequences from 
the triple disaster. More than 1000 residents died 
from direct injuries from the earthquake and 
tsunami. The disaster also inflicted serious damage 
to community healthcare systems, resulting in 
various health consequences. For example, mass 
evacuation following the disaster strained essential 
health services and infrastructure and disrupted 
social capital and networks.7
After the nuclear disaster, mandatory evacuation 
zones were issued on 12 March 2011 for the 20 
km 
radius surrounding the plant, and voluntary evac-
uation zones were additionally put into place for 
the 20–30 
km radius. As a result, the population of 
the study area dropped from its predisaster level 
of nearly 100 
000 to 40 
000 within a month of the 
triple disaster.8 Five of the eight emergency hospi-
tals in the district closed after the disaster because 
of forced evacuation or workforce shortage.7
The health effects of natural and man-made 
disasters can be both direct and indirect.9 The direct 
health effects of a disaster are defined as external 
causes such as traumas and burns that can be 
attributed directly to the disaster.10 Elderly people 
are at greater risk of increased direct mortality 
after a disaster.11 In the case of Hurricane Katrina 
in 2005 in the USA, approximately 75% of all 
direct mortality in New Orleans occurred among 
the elderly, who represented only 15% of the city’s 
total population before the disaster.12 The high 
vulnerability of the elderly to direct disaster impacts 
could be due to their impaired physical mobility, 
diminished sensory awareness and pre-existing 
health conditions.13 It is equally important to recog-
nise indirect health effects. Major disasters damage 
primary healthcare systems and food and water 
supplies, and cause displacement by evacuation and 
relocation.14 15 Previous studies have reported indi-
rect health effects such as increases in the mortality

risk of cardiovascular diseases16 or infectious diseases17 after 
disasters. A report on Hurricane Katrina suggested that indirect 
psychological health effects of disaster might be implicated in the 
persistent increase in mortality observed for at least 6 months 
after Hurricane Katrina in 2006.18 Elderly people can also be at 
greater risk of indirect health effects of disasters due to disrup-
tion to ongoing medical care or aggravation of medical condi-
tions; for example, older age was reported to be a risk factor of 
the disruption of access to medical care after T
yphoon Haiyan 
in 2013.19 Disasters can, therefore, exert powerful influences on 
individual vulnerability to physical and psychological stress, and 
may also impact health.20
However, evidence on the indirect impacts of disasters is 
limited,21 partly because they are, by definition, not directly 
measurable and partly because it is difficult to prove an indirect 
causal relationship between postdisaster mortality and morbidity 
as time passes. The major objectives of the present study were 
twofold: (1) to assess the excess mortality risk due to the indirect 
health impacts of the triple disaster in Soma and Minamisoma 
cities in Fukushima; and (2) to identify the postdisaster risk 
periods over a multiyear follow-up period and populations at 
risk of the indirect health effects.

data sources
We used vital registration records from a national survey between 
January 2006 and December 2015 (predisaster: 2006–2010; 
postdisaster: 2011–2015). Secondary use of the vital registra-
tion records was approved by the Ministry of Health, Labour 
and Welfare in compliance with the Statistics Act. Mortality data 
were classified by age, sex and cause of death in the International 
Classification of Diseases and Health-Related Problems, 10th 
Revision (ICD-10), for each month during the study period. 
Population data were obtained from the Basic Resident Regis-
ters—the nationwide resident-registry network administrated by 
municipality unit (city/town/village).
Sample selection
We defined a ‘direct death’ as a death attributed to external 
causes, primarily the physical forces of the triple disaster.22 23 
We considered the following causes of death that occurred in 
March 2011 to be direct deaths due to the disaster: S00–S09 
(injuries to the head), S12 (fractures of neck), S20–S29 (inju-
ries to the thorax), T00–T07 (injuries involving multiple body 
regions), T14 (injuries of unspecified body region), T29 (burns 
and corrosions of multiple body regions), T71 (asphyxiation) 
and T79 (certain early complications of trauma). We additionally 
considered T75.1 (drowning) that occurred on the disaster date 
as direct deaths. Our data included no mortality due to exposure 
to forces of nature (X30–X39).
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
All mortality data from Soma City and Minamisoma City, 
Fukushima Prefecture, Japan, in 2006–2015 were eligible for 
inclusion in the study. In order to investigate the indirect health 
effects of the triple disaster, we compared the excess mortality 
risk postdisaster with predisaster mortality levels after excluding 
direct deaths.
data analysis
Age-adjusted mortality rates from 2006 to 2015 were calculated 
separately for men and women using the 1985 Japanese model 
population (see online supplementary table S1).24 We then 
compared postdisaster age-adjusted mortality rates (2011–2015) 
and the average predisaster age-adjusted mortality rates between 
2006 and 2010 using Χ2 tests.
In order to assess the temporal trends in excess mortality 
risk, we compared mortality rates in each month postdisaster 
(2011–2015) with the average predisaster mortality rate (2006–
2010) using a Poisson regression model with age (0–64, 65–74, 
75–84 and 85+ years), city (Soma City or Minamisoma City) 
and year (baseline (2006–2010), 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 
2015) as covariates. In order to reduce any seasonal/monthly 
effect on the data, we constructed regression models for each 
month (January–December) separately. Our major interests were 
comparisons between postdisaster years (2011–2015) versus the 
predisaster baseline with respect to the variable ‘year’. Baseline 
risk was defined as the monthly mortality rate per year from 
2006 to 2010, which was also calculated for each month per year 
(eg, every January across the 5 years). In this regression, to avoid 
0 or small numbers of death counts for each age group in each 
month, the original age groups at 5-year intervals were reclassi-
fied into four age groups (0–64, 65–74, 75–84 and 85+ years). 
For a detailed explanation of this approach, see online supple-
mentary text S1.
We performed the cause of death-specific analysis using the 
same models to evaluate the potential difference in the post-
disaster mortality trends by cause of death. We considered the 
four leading causes of death identified in the first month of the 
disaster (March 2011). We also separately constructed a regres-
sion model for each age group using similar methods to assess 
how monthly trends in potential postdisaster excess mortality 
risk differed by age.
We used Stata/MP V
.14.1 for all analyses. P Values less than 
0.05 were considered statistically significant. R V
.3.30 was used 
to generate graphics. This study was approved by the Ethics 
Board of Soma Central Hospital (ID: 2016-A1).

Sample characteristics
Of the total number of deaths in the predisaster period 
(n=6163) and in the postdisaster period (n=7215), we excluded 
1090 deaths in 2011 as direct deaths. As a result, 6163 (women: 
2938, 48%) deaths in the predisaster period and 6125 (women: 
2953, 48%) deaths in the postdisaster period were included for 
further analysis. The numbers of indirect and direct deaths by 
age (0–39, 40–64, 65–74, 75–84, 85+), sex (male or female) 
and year (2006–2015) are shown in table 1.
Trends in age-adjusted mortality rates
Figure 1 illustrates the yearly trends in age-adjusted total 
mortality rate per 100 
000 from 2006 to 2015 for men and 
women. Comparisons of postdisaster mortality rates with that 
in the predisaster baseline period (2006–2010) demonstrated a 
statistically significant decline in 2014 (598 vs 493, p<0.01) and 
2015 (598 vs 528, p=0.04) in men and in 2015 in women (300 
vs 247, p=0.03).
Predisaster and postdisaster comparison of monthly mortality 
risks
Figure 2 shows the estimated relative risks (RRs) of mortality 
postdisaster in comparison with the predisaster baseline, which 
were based on month-specific regression models. After adjusting 
for city and age, the postdisaster mortality risk for both men 
and women was significantly higher in the first month of the 
disaster (March 2011) than that in the same month during 
 on 2 June 2019 by guest. Protected by copyright.

CI 2.16 to 3.24; RR: 2.46, 95% 
CI 1.99 to 3.03, respectively. 
This finding indicates the excess mortality risk due to the indi-
rect effects of the disaster in the first month. The mortality risk 
dramatically declined from the second month postdisaster (April 
2011), and statistical significance was observed in the 10th and 
11th month of the disaster in both men and women. The esti-
mated RRs for the first 12 months of the disaster are shown in 
online supplementary table S1.
Cause-specific mortality trends
In the first month of the disaster (March 2011), when excess 
mortality risk was identified, the four leading causes of deaths 
were pneumonia (ICD-10: J12–18, 28% of the overall mortality; 
n=47), stroke (ICD-10: I60–I69, 15%; n=25), coronary heart 
disease (ICD-10: I21–I25, 10%; n=16) and cancer (ICD-10: 
C00–97, 9%; n=15). In the same month of the predisaster base-
line period (March 2006–2010), mortality due to pneumonia, 
stroke, coronary heart diseases and cancer accounted for 16% 
(n=1049), 14% (n=877), 9% (n=580) and 26% (n=1659) of 
the overall mortality, respectively. As for pneumonia, we inves-
tigated medical records in the study area and obtained informa-
tion on 23 of the 47 patients who died from pneumonia. Among 
them, 15 (65%) were hospitalised or living in nursing care facil-
ities as of 11 March 2011.
Figure 3 shows the cause-specific trends in the RR of mortality 
during the postdisaster period. Mortality due to pneumonia, 
stroke, coronary heart disease and cancer were all significantly 
higher in the first month of the disaster (March 2011) than in 
the same month of the predisaster period (March 2006–2010). 
Estimated cause-specific RRs for the first 12 months from the 
disaster are presented in online supplementary table S3.

Age-specific predisaster and postdisaster comparison of 
monthly mortality risks
The age-specific RRs of mortality during the postdisaster period 
compared with the predisaster baseline are plotted in figure 4. 
For both sexes, in the first month of the disaster (March 2011), 
the mortality risks in all age groups were significantly higher 
than those in the same month of the predisaster baseline period 
(March 2006–2010). Among women aged 85 years and over, 
significantly higher mortality risk was also identified in the third 
month of the disaster (May 2011). The estimated RRs in each 
age group for the first 12 months of the disaster are shown in 
online supplementary table S4.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively 
estimate the short-term and long-term indirect health impacts 
of the triple disaster (earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster) 
in Fukushima through the measurement of excess mortality 
risk. The results of this study showed that postdisaster excess 
mortality risk was greatest in the first month of the 5-year 
postdisaster period. This mortality increase may be due to the 
indirect health effects of the disaster. Previous studies reported 
increased burdens of chronic diseases and psychological disor-
ders after the disaster in Fukushima, which are consistent with 
our findings.25 26 In order to mitigate such indirect health

effects of disasters, initial public health support, such as facili-
tating community development, restoring livelihoods, providing 
psychosocial support to inform people and mobilising commu-
nity partnership, is important.27–29 This study also suggested the 
importance of initial public health support, particularly within 
the first month postdisaster, in reducing indirect health effects 
of a disaster.
The increase in mortality risks persisted for 3 
months after 
the disaster among women 85 years or older (figure 4). This 
persistent increase in mortality risk is consistent with that 
observed after Hurricane Katrina.18 Our findings suggest that 
mortality risk due to the indirect health effects of the disaster 
may be more severe and persistent among the elderly than among 
younger groups. This larger effect among the elderly may be 
explained by their increased risks of impaired physical mobility, 
diminished sensory awareness, poor chronic health conditions, 
and social and economic limitations,30 which may hinder their 
adaptability after disasters.13 Several studies reported increased 
health burdens among the elderly associated with the indirect 
health effects of a disaster.31 32 Our findings suggest that the 
public health support to mitigate the indirect health effects of 
disasters may be more important among the elderly than in the 
general population.
The four leading causes of death included pneumonia, coro-
nary heart disease, stroke and cancer. These increases in mortality 
risk after disasters are consistent with past studies.33 34 Patients 
with chronic conditions such as cancer and those with acute 
health conditions such as pneumonia, coronary heart disease and 
stroke are dependent on medical care, which may explain their 
vulnerability to the impacts of a disaster, including the loss of 
access to medical care, environmental change, and physical and 
psychological stress.
In particular, pneumonia accounted for 28% (47/165) of the 
deaths during the first month after the earthquake. A previous 
study hypothesised that postdisaster increases in pneumonia 
were caused by the swallowing of dust and water carried by 
the tsunami.33 However, in our findings, more than half of the 
patients who died from pneumonia were in inpatient medical 
facilities at the time of the earthquake, making them unlikely 
to be directly affected by the tsunami. A previous study on 
patients with pneumonia after the disaster suggested that most 
cases of pneumonia were aspiration pneumonia acquired in a 
nursing home, which was associated with low patient activities 
of daily living status.34 Deterioration of primary care after disas-
ters makes it difficult to provide adequate oral care in order 
to reduce the mortality rate of aspiration pneumonia in such 
cases.35
In contrast to the first month after the disaster, there were no 
significant increases in the mortality risks in the second month 
and thereafter, although previous disaster studies reported exac-
erbation of chronic diseases in affected areas.25 26 There are a few 
possible explanations. First, temporary housing was provided 
to reduce the mortality risk due to psychological stress20 and 
social isolation36 after the triple disaster: housing assignments 
in temporary housing were based on pre-earthquake addresses 
to maintain a sense of community. Second, health facilities were 
at least partially restored in the affected areas by the second 
postdisaster month and onwards. These elements could have 
mitigated the expected increase in mortality by exacerbation of 
chronic diseases.37 For effective long-term support after disas-
ters, further monitoring the effectiveness of individual measures 
will be essential.
It is also of note that the increased mortality risks did not 
persist over the 5 
years since the triple disaster. The series of 
disasters, particularly the nuclear disaster at Fukushima Daiichi 
Nuclear Power Plant, has led to serious concerns about health 
problems among residents in the affected area. Although past 
studies showed that radiation exposure among residents of the 
study area was not high enough to cause health problems,38 39 
fear for health damage due to radiation exposure remains.40 
There was no increase in cancer mortality rates observed in 
this study; however, the 5-year study period is likely not long 
enough to assess the potential carcinogenic effects of radiation.41 
Therefore, we are not able to conclude that cancer incidence 
due to radiation exposure has not increased in this area. A long-
term analysis of the exposed population cohort will be required 
 
in order to evaluate the effects of radiation exposure on 
carcinogenesis.

limitations
This study has several limitations. First, the estimated indi-
rect mortality risk in the latter period should be interpreted 
with caution. As shown in figure 1, the age-adjusted mortality 
rate has been decreasing throughout the study period. This 
decreasing trend, in line with age-adjusted mortality rates in 
Japan as a whole,42 might be explained by the reduction of 
cancer mortality, new technologies or improved management 
of chronic diseases.43 44 The long-term indirect health effects 
of the disaster on mortality risk might be counterbalanced by 
the decreasing mortality trends. Second, in the present study, 
mortality data were based on the Basic Resident Registers, and 
residents who moved their registrations to outside the study area 
were excluded. Therefore, the estimation of mortality risk in 
this study may be biased due to sampling limitations. Finally, the 
causes of death listed in the vital registration are occasionally 
inaccurate and incomplete, particularly in the ageing popula-
tion.45 In the present study, we attempted to minimise such bias 
by checking medical records and other sources.
ConCluSIon
In the 5 
years since the 2011 triple disaster in Japan, mortality 
risk, excluding direct health damage from the disaster, was highest 
in the first month after the disaster. This excess risk of death is 
attributed to the indirect health impacts of the triple disaster. 
The increased mortality was more severe and long-lasting among 
the elderly. Early public health support for the elderly, including 
facilitating community development, restoring livelihoods and 
providing psychosocial support, preferably within a month of 
a disaster, is one of the most important factors in reducing the 
indirect health effects of a disaster.
What this study adds
 
► We clarified that the postdisaster mortality risk was 
significantly higher in the first month of the disaster 
compared with that during the predisaster period (2006–
2010), which suggests excess mortality risk due to the 
indirect health effects of the disaster.
 
► The indirect health effects of a disaster may be more severe 
and persistent among the elderly than among younger 
groups. Early public health support, especially for the elderly, 
such as facilitating community development, restoring 
livelihoods, providing psychosocial support to inform people 
and mobilising community partnerships, is an important 
factor for reducing the indirect health effects of a disaster.
What is already known on this subject
 
► Although the health effects of natural and man-made 
disasters can be both direct and indirect, there is little 
evidence on the indirect health effects of a disaster.
 
► The 2011 triple disaster (earthquake, tsunami and nuclear 
disaster) in Fukushima resulted in the opportunity to assess 
excess mortality risk due to the indirect health effects of the 
disaster.
