 Space-based bias of covert visual attention in
complex regional pain syndrome

Some patients with complex regional pain syndrome report that movements of the affected limb are slow, more effortful, and lack
automaticity. These symptoms have been likened to the syndrome that sometimes follows brain injury called hemispatial neglect, in
which patients exhibit attentional impairments and problems with movements affecting the contralesional side of the body and space.
Psychophysical testing of patients with complex regional pain syndrome has found evidence for spatial biases when judging visual targets
distanced at 2m, but not in directions that indicate reduced attention to the affected side. In contrast, when judging visual or tactile stimuli
presented on their own body surface, or pictures of hands and feet within arm’s reach, patients with complex regional pain syndrome
exhibited a bias away from the affected side. What is not yet known is whether patients with complex regional pain syndrome only have
biased attention for bodily-specific information in the space within arm’s reach, or whether they also show a bias for information that is not
associated with the body, suggesting a more generalized attention deficit. Using a temporal order judgement task, we found that patients
with complex regional pain syndrome processed visual stimuli more slowly on the affected side (relative to the unaffected side) when the
lights were projected onto a blank surface (i.e. when no bodily information was visible), and when the lights were projected onto the dorsal
surfaces of their uncrossed hands. However, with the arms crossed (such that the left and right lights projected onto the right and left hands,
respectively), patients’ responses were no different than controls. These results provide the first demonstration of a generalized attention bias
away from the affected side of space in complex regional pain syndrome patients that is not specifically related to bodily information. They
also suggest a separate and additional bias of visual attention away from the affected hand. The strength of attention bias was predicted by
scores on a self-report measure of body perception distortion; but not by pain intensity, time since diagnosis, or affected body side (left or
right). At an individual level, those patients whose upper limbs were most affected had a higher incidence of inattention than those whose
lower limbs were most affected. However, at a group level, affected limb (upper or lower) did not predict bias magnitude; nor did three
measures designed to assess possible asymmetries in the distribution of movements across space. It is concluded that inattention in near
space in complex regional pain syndrome may arise in parallel with a distorted perception of the body.

Introduction
In some chronic pain conditions—including phantom limb
pain, repetitive strain injury, whiplash, and musician’s dys-
tonia—symptoms arise that cannot be explained by pathology
of the affected body part. Patients with complex regional pain
syndrome (CRPS) demonstrate severe pain, swelling and
motor dysfunction in a limb, and also perceptual changes
that suggest altered cortical signalling for sensation and move-
ment (Schwoebel et al., 2001; Fo
¨rderreuther et al., 2004;
Robinson et al., 2011). They also report that movements of
the affected limb are slow, effortful, and lack automaticity
(Galer et al., 1995; Galer and Jensen, 1999). Slowed move-
ments and feelings of estrangement from the affected limb(s)
in patients with CRPS were first referred to as ‘neglect-like’
symptoms by Galer et al. (1995) because of their resemblance
to the syndrome of hemispatial neglect (‘neglect’), which may
follow brain injury. Brain-lesioned patients with neglect show
inattention and motor impairments affecting the contrale-
sional side of the body and space (Bisiach and Vallar, 2000;
Parton et al., 2004). The term ‘neglect-like’ has since been
used widely by both researchers and clinicians. However, as
the authors later emphasized, there are also many differences
between the unusual experiences and lateralized motor and
sensory deficits of patients with CRPS, and the symptoms
of patients with hemispatial neglect following brain injury.
Thus, we reserve the term ‘neglect’ for the syndrome that
follows brain injury, and we refer to ‘inattention’ or ‘biased
attention’ when referring to the hypothesized sensory imbal-
ance of patients with CRPS. Notably, pain and other symp-
toms might be alleviated in patients with CRPS treated with
prism adaptation (Sumitani et al., 2007a; Bultitude and Rafal,
2010; Christophe et al., 2016), a promising behavioural treat-
ment for neglect following brain injury (Rossetti et al., 1998;
Luaute
´ et al., 2006; Serino et al., 2006, 2009; Shiraishi et al.,
2008, 2010; Mizuno et al., 2011; Saevarsson et al., 2012;
Rode et al., 2014; La
`davas et al., 2015). Finding that a treat-
ment for neglect also helps patients with CRPS suggests that a
bias in spatial attention might contribute to the manifestation
and maintenance of the condition.
Despite the beneficial effects of prism adaptation on
CRPS, there is little direct evidence of biased spatial atten-
tion in those with the condition (for a review see Torta
et al., 2016). Indeed, Punt et al. (2013) argued that the
motor impairments that first prompted the use of the
term ‘neglect-like’ with regards to CRPS could be better
categorized as learned non-use. Testing sensory processing,
rather than motor function, in CRPS could provide more
certain information about whether altered spatial percep-
tion plays a role in physical CRPS symptoms.
Several studies have examined the performance of pa-
tients with CRPS on tests of visual attention, with mixed
results. When tested with classic pen-and-paper tests of
neglect, such as figure copying and line bisection, patients
with CRPS show none of the omissions or displacements
that would indicate problems with directing attention to the
affected side of space (Fo
¨rderreuther et al., 2004; Robinson
et al., 2011; Kolb et al., 2012; Reinersmann et al., 2012;
but see Cohen et al., 2013, for an example of one patient
whose drawing of a house appears to lack detail on one
side). Patients with CRPS also exhibited no bias on a task
that is highly sensitive to the allocation of visual attention
and involves making saccades to cued and uncued targets
(Filippopulos et al., 2015). These studies suggest that any
spatial bias in patients with CRPS is likely subtle at best,
and might not affect overt visual attention.
Directly counter to the hypothesis that attention is biased
away from the affected side, Sumitani et al. (2007b, 2014)
and Uematsu et al. (2009) reported that when judging
when a point of light was positioned straight ahead of
their body midline in a darkened room, patients with
CRPS were biased towards the ‘affected’ side of space.
The researchers interpreted this as evidence for over-
representation of the affected side of space due to exagger-
ated somatosensory input from the affected limb. Other
groups, however, have reported that straight-ahead judge-
ments made by patients with CRPS were biased toward the
left visual field regardless of the side of the body that was
affected (Reinersmann et al., 2012), or else were unbiased
(Kolb et al., 2012; Christophe et al., 2016). No study has
so far provided evidence of a visual straight-ahead bias
away from the affected side in CRPS. Therefore, although
there may be measurable changes in spatial perception in
patients with CRPS, these might not always manifest them-
selves as a bias away from the affected limb. Significantly
deviated
visual
straight

judgements
were
only
observed when patients with CRPS were tested in darkened
rooms and not when the rooms were well illuminated, sug-
gesting that patients have problems with coding the loca-
tion
of
visual
information
in
relation
to
the
body
(‘egocentric’ reference frame) that are overcome when spa-
tial information can be coded with reference to the sur-
rounding
environment
(‘allocentric’
reference
frame).
The evidence from visual straight-ahead judgements of
patients with CRPS indicates a potential role of bodily in-
formation in driving spatial bias in CRPS, since perception
of visual straight-ahead is directly influenced by felt infor-
mation about body orientation (Biguer et al., 1988; Roll
et al., 1991; Taylor and McCloskey, 1991; Karnath et al.,
1994).
Biased covert visual attention in CRPS

 A failure to detect a spatial attention bias in earlier work
may relate to the nature of the task used. Using a sensitive
test of tactile attention, Moseley et al. (2009) provided the
first objective evidence that patients with CRPS have an
attentional bias away from the affected side. Patients with
CRPS processed touch applied to the affected hand more
slowly as compared to the unaffected hand, resembling
tactile processing biases that have been reported in patients
with neglect following brain injury (Smania and Aglioti,
1995). This pattern reversed when the hands were crossed,
suggesting that patients with CRPS exhibit deficits in at-
tending to the side of space within which their affected
limb normally resides rather than to the affected limb itself.
In a recent set of studies, patients with CRPS again showed
attentional biases for tactile stimuli, when bisecting horizontal
lines that were overlaid onto the affected body part, and
when bisecting horizontal lines that were overlaid on the
unaffected forearm when it was positioned in the affected
side of space (Reid et al., 2016). Patients exhibited no atten-
tional biases, however, for auditory stimuli, for standard line
bisection in which lines were presented on pieces of paper
that were otherwise blank, or when bisecting horizontal lines
on the unaffected forearm when it was positioned in the un-
affected side of space. Furthermore, the researchers presented
evidence that when mentally rotating pictures of hands, pa-
tients with upper limb CRPS were slower to identify the lat-
erality of pictures of hands that corresponded to their
affected hand relative to pictures of hands that corresponded
to their unaffected hand, but this difference only arose when
the pictures were presented in the affected side of space. The
same pattern was displayed by patients with lower limb
CRPS when mentally rotating pictures of feet. The authors
interpreted this pattern of deficits, which they termed ‘soma-
tospatial inattention’, as an impaired capacity to integrate
bodily information with spatial processing. One way to ex-
plore whether spatial processing deficits in CRPS are indeed
limited to bodily information would be to compare responses
to visual information presented on the body surface versus
responses to visual information presented in the same region
in space without vision of the body.
Taken together, the evidence discussed thus far suggests
that CRPS may be accompanied by complex and contrast-
ing changes in perception across different sensory modal-
ities (i.e. vision and touch), and for information presented
in different regions of space (i.e. on the body, within arm’s
reach of the head and torso, or in the region of space that
is outside of arm’s reach, Legrain et al., 2012). The pattern
of responses to evoked stimuli in near space is consistent
with reduced attention to the affected as compared to the
unaffected side of space, and this reduction is so far limited
to tasks that involve some form of bodily information (i.e.
touch, or implied or real vision of a limb). Near space is
here defined as the region of space surrounding the torso
and head that is within the furthest possible extent of arms
reach of the participant, including but not limited to the
space that is occupied by the arms and hands at any given
moment. There is, as yet, no evidence for a bias in general
sensory processing in near space (i.e. a bias that is not
limited to information about a limb), but a sufficiently sen-
sitive test might reveal such a bias. The primary aim of the
present study was therefore to measure the distribution of
covert attention of patients with CRPS to visual informa-
tion presented in near space without vision of the hands,
and on the surface of the hands.
To achieve this goal, we measured visual attention using a
temporal order judgement (TOJ) task. Two visual stimuli were
briefly presented, one on either side of space, separated by
different amounts of time. Two measures can thus be derived.
First, the ‘point of subjective simultaneity’ (PSS) can be derived
to assess the spatial (left versus right) bias in attention. The
prediction was that patients with CRPS would require the
stimuli to appear earlier on the affected as compared to the
unaffected side of space for them to be perceived as simultan-
eous, consistent with a bias of attention away from the affected
side. Second, the ‘just noticeable difference’ (JND) provides a
measure of the smallest interval needed to reliably indicate the
temporal order in which the two stimuli were presented, giving
a measure of temporal acuity. There is evidence to suggest that
patients with neglect following brain injury have decreased
temporal acuity on both TOJ tasks (Barrett et al., 2010) and
attentional blink paradigms (Husain et al., 1997). Chronic pain
also reduces cognitive resources (Eccleston, 1995), and healthy
volunteers who completed a TOJ task under high cognitive
load had larger JNDs (Pe
´rez et al., 2008). We therefore pre-
dicted that the JND values of patients with CRPS would be
larger than for control participants.
Participants completed the TOJ task under three separate
conditions. In the first condition, the participants sat with
their hands and arms positioned out of sight next to their
torso and the stimuli appeared on a white board placed on
the table in front of them. Through this condition we aimed to
examine whether CRPS is associated with a bias in attention
to visual information. In the second condition, the participants
placed their hands on the board such that the stimuli appeared
on their uncrossed hands, thus enabling us to examine whether
any bias in visual attention is limited to, or stronger for, in-
formation that appears on the surface of the hands (consistent
with a body-based bias in attention as opposed to a bias that
was independent of bodily information). In the third condition,
the stimuli appeared on the participants’ crossed hands, thus
enabling us to examine whether any body-based bias in visual
attention was specific to the hand on the affected side of the
body or whichever hand that was positioned within the af-
fected side of space. Finally, to evaluate whether any body-
based bias in visual attention was specific to the affected limb,
we recruited both patients with upper-limb CRPS and patients
with lower-limb CRPS.
The second aim of the present study was to test which clin-
ical or cognitive factors predict PSS values in patients with
CRPS. Knowing the markers that most strongly relate to
any attentional bias could provide insights into how it might
arise. We examined four possible explanations for how an
attentional bias might arise in CRPS (they need not be con-
sidered as mutually exclusive). First, attention may be diverted

 away from the affected side as an implicit mechanism to lessen
the impact of stimuli that may provoke pain. Such a tendency
could be proportional to the severity of pain. We therefore
included pain intensity as a possible predictor of attentional
bias. Second, patients with CRPS report changes in the per-
ceived size and shape of the affected limb, as well as the im-
pression that their limb is alien to them and not part of their
body. These reports are consistent with altered perceptual and
cognitive representations of the affected limb (i.e. changes in
what the affected limb is felt to be like and what the body is
believed to be like; Longo et al., 2010). Altered body repre-
sentation may interfere with the ability to process information
coming from the limb and the space that surrounds it (Farne
`
et al., 2000; van der Hoort et al., 2011; Tame
` et al., 2013;
D’Amour et al., 2015). To explore this possibility, we included
one subjective (Lewis and McCabe, 2010) and one objective
(Reinersmann et al., 2012) measure of limb representation as
possible predictors of any attentional bias.
A third possible attention-biasing mechanism in CRPS re-
lates to the proposal that perception and action in reaching
space share a common hand-centred frame of reference
(Graziano
et
al.,
1994;
Graziano,
1999;
Fogassi
and
Luppino, 2005; Makin et al., 2007, 2009). If this is the
case, then a tendency to favour the unaffected limb by pa-
tients with CRPS (e.g. through learned non-use; Punt et al.,
2013) might well lead to an asymmetrical representation of
near space. This proposal is supported by evidence that at-
tention in upper-limb amputees is biased away from the re-
sidual limb in near space, but not in far space (Makin et al.,
2010). An asymmetry in the representation of space that is
driven by uneven use of the limbs on the two sides of the
body would only be expected to manifest in upper-limb pa-
tients, as lower-limb CRPS should not significantly alter the
distribution of movements within arm-reaching space. We
also administered self-report measures of the extent of pos-
sible motor asymmetries, specifically handedness and pain-
related fear of movement. Action-driven changes in spatial
representations are likely to be greatest when there has
been a marked change in the hand that is used for daily
tasks, therefore we also measured any change in the partici-
pants’ handedness at the time of testing relative to before the
development of CRPS. Change in handedness is most likely
to occur when CRPS of the dominant hand leads to a reduc-
tion in its use, but could also occur when CRPS of the non-
dominant hand leads to a greater favouring of the dominant
hand. This measure is similar to recording whether or not the
person’s affected limb was their dominant or non-dominant
hand, but had the added advantage of allowing us to quan-
tify the extent of any increase or decrease in handedness
rather than being limited to categorical coding. If the atten-
tion bias of patients with CRPS is driven by action asymme-
tries in near space, it should only be manifested in patients
with upper-limb CRPS, and should be predicted by affected
limb and other measures of motor asymmetries.
Finally, the fourth possibility that we wished to explore
here was whether any attentional bias would be more pro-
nounced in patients with CRPS in whom the left side of the
body was affected as compared to those with CRPS affect-
ing the right side. The greater role of the right cerebral
hemisphere in some aspects of spatial attention is evidenced
by neuroimaging studies (Chen and Spence, 1997; Nobre
et al., 1997; Corbetta and Shulman, 2002; Shulman et al.,
2010), the higher frequency of hemispatial neglect following
right- than left-hemisphere lesions (Stone et al., 1993; Beis
et al., 2004; Ringman et al., 2004; Becker and Karnath,
2007), and asymmetries in the performance of healthy par-
ticipants in some spatial tasks (Jewell and McCourt, 2000).
Thus, inattention in CRPS could be more pronounced in
those patients in whom the left side of the body is most
affected, because this would presumably lead to greater
right-hemisphere reorganization. We therefore examined
whether the magnitude of any attentional bias could be pre-
dicted by which side of the body was affected.
For all four possible drivers of attention bias—pain, distor-
tions in limb representation, asymmetries in movement distri-
bution in near space, and side of the body—it could be
expected that the magnitude of the bias would increase over
time. We therefore included time since diagnosis as a final
possible predictor of attention bias. Finally, we also tested
which of the same factors predicted JNDs. Although temporal
acuity was not the primary focus of the present study, exam-
ining which factors predict JNDs could provide insights into
whether any differences between patients and controls for this
measure can be attributed to changes to cognitive function
that resemble those that are seen in neglect following brain
injury, or are instead related to the generalized decrement in
cognitive function that is associated with chronic pain.
In summary, we hypothesized that patients with CRPS
would show a bias in covert visual attention away from
their affected side in the TOJ task. The extent to which this
bias is related to bodily information could be informed by any
differences in the performance of upper- and lower-limb pa-
tients with CRPS, and by any differences when stimuli are
presented on a blank board, on the patient’s uncrossed
hands, or on their crossed hands. We also tested which of
several factors could predict spatial attention and temporal
acuity in CRPS to identify possible mechanisms through
which any abnormalities in these measures might arise.
Materials and methods
Participants
Twenty-four patients with CRPS exclusively or predominantly
affecting one limb on one side of the body were recruited from
the Oxford University and Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS
Trusts (Table 1). Patients were excluded if they were diagnosed
53 months prior to the study date, if they were diagnosed
with any neurological injury/disorder or any severe psychiatric
illness, or if their English language comprehension was not
sufficient for them to understand the information sheet and
task instructions. The current ‘Budapest’ diagnostic criteria
are more conservative for diagnosing patients with CRPS for
research purposes than when making a clinical diagnosis

 (Harden et al., 2007). However, we decided to retain all patients
to enable measurement of visual attention across a broad spec-
trum of severity of CRPS. Twenty-one patients met the research
diagnostic criteria, one met the clinical diagnostic criteria, and
two were diagnosed with CRPS not otherwise specified. Twelve
patients had predominantly upper-limb CRPS [mean age = 53
years, standard error of the mean (SEM) = 3.8; one male] and
12 had predominantly lower-limb CRPS (mean age = 36 years,
SEM = 3.6; four males). Two patients were diagnosed with
CRPS II as they reported that nerve injuries were associated
with the onset of their symptoms. The remaining patients were
diagnosed with CRPS I.
Twenty-four age- and sex-matched pain-free control partici-
pants
were
recruited
through
community
advertisements
(mean age = 46 years, SEM = 3.0; five males). All of the par-
ticipants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and gave
written informed consent to participate in a research protocol
approved by hospital and university ethics committees accord-

Self-report measures
All
participants
completed
the
Edinburgh
Handedness
Inventory (Oldfield, 1971), which is typically scored from
�100 (indicating extreme left-handedness) to 100 (indicating
extreme right-handedness). According to this scoring, two con-
trol participants and five patients with CRPS were left-handed.
The remaining participants were right-handed. To express
handedness scores in terms of the degree to which the hand
on the affected side of the body was used for everyday tasks,
handedness scores for the patients with CRPS were re-ex-
pressed such that negative and positive numbers indicated
preferences for using the hand on the affected and unaffected
side of their body, respectively.
Patients with CRPS completed four additional self-report
measures that were not completed by the controls. The first
was a second version of the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory
to indicate their memory of hand preference prior to the onset
of CRPS. From this, a Handedness Change score was calcu-
lated as the difference between the handedness quotients before
CRPS onset and at the time of testing. Second, patients rated
current pain intensity on a numerical rating scale ranging from
0 (‘no pain’) to 10 (‘worst possible pain’). Third, to measure
the extent of their disturbance in body representation, patients
with CRPS completed the 7-item Bath CRPS Body Perception
Disturbance Scale (CRPS BPDS; Lewis and McCabe, 2010),
which is scored on a scale of 0 (no body perception disturb-
ance) to 57 (highest possible body perception disturbance).
Fourth, to measure pain-related fear of movement and re-
injury,
patients
completed
the
17-item
Tampa
Scale
of
Kinesiophobia (TSK; Miller et al., 1991), scored from 17 (no
kinesiophobia) to 68 (highest possible kinesiophobia).
Hand laterality judgement
A hand laterality judgement task was used as an objective
measure of body representation (Viswanathan et al., 2012).
The stimuli and procedure were similar to those described
elsewhere (Reinersmann et al., 2010). The stimuli consisted
of 100 14.5 cm wide � 9.5 cm high pictures of hands photo-
graphed in different postures and orientations. The pictures

the distal half of the forearm to a maximum of the entire arm
and shoulder, and part of the torso. The hand was positioned
in the centre of every picture. Each posture was photographed
for both the left and right hand such that the stimuli consisted
of 50 left-hand and 50 right-hand images that depicted iden-
tical postures. For each hand, 30 pictures depicted ‘medial’
hand postures, 10 pictures depicted ‘anterior’ hand postures,
and 10 depicted ‘uncommon’ hand postures. The total surface
area of the picture that contained the hand varied depending
on which posture was being depicted, and ranged from 2.0 cm
wide � 3.1 cm high for the least expansive posture to 6.0 cm
wide � 6.0 cm high for the most expansive posture. The same
Caucasian adult was depicted in all the photographs. They
wore a loose-fitting black t-shirt and stood in front of a neutral
background. There was insufficient information to judge the
sex of the person depicted in the photographs. The pictures
were presented at a viewing distance of �50 cm for 500 ms

Windows 7. Participants indicated the laterality (left or right)
of the hand by pressing the left or right button on a custom-
built button box. Patients with CRPS responded using the
index and middle fingers of the hand on the unaffected side
of their body. Half of the control participants responded using
their left hand and half responded using their right hand. The
participants were informed that both speed and accuracy were
important. The trial timed-out after 10 s.
Visual temporal order judgement
For the visual TOJ task, a white board (45.6cm wide � 35.5cm
deep) with a 3mm-diameter fixation point drawn at its centre
was placed on a table. Two identical red laser pointers were
mounted above the board using a burette stand, projecting
light stimuli (3mm diameter) 9cm to the left and right of the
fixation point. The left–right arrangement of the laser pointers
was swapped for half the participants to compensate for any
possible difference in their brightness. The laser pointers were
controlled via the parallel port by Eprime 2.0 software running
on a Windows 7 operating system.
Participants sat at the table with their head resting on a chin-
rest and their legs uncrossed. Both laser pointers were turned
on before the beginning of each block while the participant
positioned their hands. During the ‘no hands’ condition, the
participants held their hands folded together immediately in
front of the base of the chin-rest such that they were occluded
from view. During the ‘uncrossed’ condition, the participants
positioned their hands palms-down on the white board such
that the left and right light appeared on the centre of the
dorsal surface of their left and right hand, respectively. In
the ‘crossed’ condition, the participants crossed their hands
such that the left and right light appeared on the centre of
the dorsal surface of the right and left hand, respectively. To
accommodate these hand arrangements, the distance of the
board (and therefore the locations of the fixation cross and
targets) from the body varied between participants such that
they could comfortably hold their hands in the uncrossed and
crossed positions while they also rested their head on the chin-
rest. The horizontal distance between the fixation point and
each participant’s torso was �28 cm.
The TOJ task was identical for each condition and the ex-
perimenter initiated each trial. After a pause that varied ran-
domly between 500 and 1000 ms, the lights flashed for 10 ms
each. There were 15 repetitions for each of 10 temporal off-
sets: �120, �60, �30, �15, �5, 5, 15, 30, 60 and 120 ms.
Negative values represent those conditions in which the first
light appeared on the affected side of space for the patients
with CRPS, and on the side of the non-dominant hand for the
control participants. Positive numbers represent those trials in
which the light first appeared on the unaffected side of space
for the patients with CRPS, and on the side of the dominant
hand for the control participants. The trials were presented in
a pseudorandomized order whereby each temporal offset
occurred once within each set of 10 trials. The participants
indicated the light that appeared first (left or right, two-alter-
nate forced-choice) with a vocal response. The experimenter
keyed the response into the computer, which initiated the next
trial.
Data preparation
For the hand laterality judgement task, mean reaction times
and percentage accuracy were calculated separately for the af-
fected and unaffected (patients with CRPS) or non-dominant
and dominant (controls) Hand Picture conditions. Two pa-
tients with CRPS did not complete the hand laterality judge-
ment task due to computer failure on the day of testing.
The TOJ data were expressed in terms of the proportion of
trials in which the participant reported that the light had ap-
peared first on the unaffected (patients with CRPS) or domin-
ant (controls) side. For each participant, and each condition,
these data were fitted with a cumulative Gaussian using a
maximum-likelihood criterion. The PSS was calculated as the
temporal offset at which participants responded that the two
responses (‘unaffected first’ / ‘affected first’ or ‘dominant first’ /
‘non-dominant first’) were equiprobable. Negative values indi-
cated that the light needed to appear earlier on the affected
(patients with CRPS) or non-dominant (controls) side of space
for the two stimuli to be perceived as simultaneous. As per
convention, the JND was defined as the difference between the
75% and 25% points of the cumulative Gaussian. There were
three instances in which data were not available for particular
conditions for individual patients. Details of how these were
managed are provided in the Supplementary material.
Statistical analyses
Analyses were performed with R software (R Core Team,
2015) using linear mixed models regression with bootstrapping
procedures wherein 1000 bootstrap samples were generated
for each analysis. The combination of linear mixed models
and bootstrapping addressed potential problems that could
arise due to missing data and differences in the variances for
the patients and the control groups. A variable made a signifi-
cant contribution to predicting the outcome variable when the
95% confidence interval (CI) around the regression coefficient
(B) did not include zero.
The analyses for the hand laterality judgement task was as
follows: Group (controls, patients) and Hand Picture (affected/

 Group � Hand picture. Analyses were repeated with percent-
age scores subjected to an arcsine transformation; no qualita-
tive change appeared and so we report the untransformed
analyses for clarity.
For the visual TOJ task, Group (controls, patients) and
Hand arrangement (no hands, uncrossed, and crossed) were
entered using dummy variable coding into the analyses of
the PSS and JND data, along with the interaction term
Group � Hand arrangement. Presuming that these analyses re-
vealed that the patients with CRPS differed significantly from
controls, further analyses were planned to determine the con-
tribution of possible explanatory variables to PSSs and JNDs
within the CRPS group. The possible explanatory variables
identified prior to the study were: current pain intensity;
CRPS BPDS score; a measure of performance on the hand
laterality judgement task (to be chosen based on the outcome
of the analysis of reaction times and percentage accuracy for
this task); affected limb; Z-scores of handedness, Z-scores of
handedness change; TSK score; affected body-side; and weeks
since diagnosis.
Results
Hand laterality judgement task
Tables 2 and 3 show the coefficient estimates and their 95%
CIs for the analyses of reaction times and accuracy, respect-
ively. Group significantly predicted reaction times on the hand
laterality judgement task, with the patients with CRPS
(mean = 1414ms, SEM = 119) an average of 163ms slower
than the controls (mean = 1251ms, SEM = 70). Neither the
laterality
of
the
Hand
Picture,
nor
the
interaction
of
Group � Hand
Picture,
significantly
contributed
to
the
model. None of the entered variables contributed to the pre-
diction of Accuracy on the hand laterality judgement task
(mean = 76.7%, SEM = 2.4, pooled across patients and con-
trols). Reinersmann et al. (2010) reported a similar general-
ized delay in the reaction times of patients with CRPS to
pictures of hands (i.e. slower reaction times to pictures of
any hands, regardless of laterality), but the same patients
showed normal performance on tests of alertness and working
memory. This suggests that the significant prediction of reac-
tion times by Group in the present study could reflect a deficit
in body representation that generalizes to representations of
both hands (as was concluded by Reinersmann et al., 2010).
We therefore decided to enter the mean reaction time of each
CRPS patient on the hand laterality judgement task (con-
verted to Z-scores) as the objective measure of body represen-
tation for the prediction of PSSs and JNDs.
Visual temporal order judgement
task
Figure 1 shows psychometric functions fitted to the cumu-
lative data for the CRPS and control groups for each con-
dition of Hand arrangement. Visual inspection of Fig. 1
reveals that the PSS values of patients with CRPS were,
numerically, more negative than those for the controls in
the no hands and uncrossed conditions. In the crossed
hands condition, the PSS value for the cumulative CRPS
and control group data were numerically similar and
close to zero. Compared to controls, the slopes of the psy-
chometric functions for the patients with CRPS in all three
Hand arrangement conditions are qualitatively less steep,
giving
rise
to
numerically
larger
JNDs.

[t(23) = 3.4, P = 0.003; 95% CI = �43.5 to �12.6]. The

condition
[t(23) = 1.8,
P = 0.081,
95%
CI = �32.2
to
1.77] and crossed condition [t(21) = 0.17, P = 0.87, 95%
CI = �16.3 to 15.7] were not significantly different from
0. The PSS values for the control participants were not
significantly different to 0 in the no hands condition
[t(23) = 0.62, P = 0.54, 95% CI = �17.0 to 7.4], the un-
crossed condition [t(23) = 1.5, P = 0.15, 95% CI = �14.3
to 2.1], or the crossed condition [t(23) = 1.06, P = 0.30,
95% CI = �19.0 to 4.4].
Point of subjective simultaneity analysis
Comparison of patients with complex regional pain syndrome
and control
Group (control versus patient) was a significant predictor
of
the
PSS
(Table
4).
The
PSSs
for
the
patients
(mean = �15.0 ms, SEM = 8.2) were an average of 9 ms fur-
ther towards the affected/non-dominant side of space rela-
tive to the control group (mean = �5.9 ms, SEM = 6.0). In
the no hands condition, the patients had a 22 ms bias rela-
tive to the controls. The coefficient estimate for the first
Group � Hand
arrangement
interaction
term
indicates
that the performance difference between the patients and
the controls in the uncrossed condition was an average of
13 ms smaller than the performance difference between the
two groups in the no hands condition; however, the confi-
dence interval for the coefficient estimate indicates that this
difference was not significant (P 4 0.05). This means, stat-
istically, that the patients’ PSS values were similarly biased
in the no hands and uncrossed conditions. By contrast, the
coefficient estimate and confidence interval for the second
Group � Hand arrangement interaction term indicate that
the performance difference between the patients and the
controls in the crossed condition was significantly smaller
than the performance difference in the no hands condition
by an average of 27 ms. As is apparent in Fig. 1, this
change left the two groups showing similar PSS values in
the crossed condition. A post hoc t-test with bootstrapping
(n = 1000 samples) to compare the PSS values for the pa-
tient and control groups in the crossed condition was not
significant
[t(44) = 0.58,
P = 0.58,
95%
CI = �13.9
to
27.5]. This confirms that the patients’ performance in this
condition was not significantly biased compared to con-
trols.

 difference to be most important for ascertaining whether
the patients with CRPS showed a bias in any given condi-
tion. However, it should be noted that a second post hoc
t-tests with bootstrapping (n = 1000 samples), which com-
pared the PSS values of the patient group in the no hands
and
crossed
conditions,
was
also
not
significant
[t(21) = 2.17, P = 0.08, 95% CI = �53.0 to �1.7].
Neither of the Hand arrangement terms (uncrossed versus
no hands and crossed versus no hands) were significant,
indicating that this variable did not contribute significantly
to the prediction of PSS when considered independently of
Group.
Analysis of possible predictors of patients’ point of subjective
simultaneity values
The only term that significantly predicted PSS was CRPS
BPDS score, with PSS shifting towards the affected side by
1.7 ms for every one point increase in body perception dis-
turbance score (Table 5).
Inspection of individual patterns in point of subjective
simultaneity values
Inspection of individual data revealed patterns of potential
interest concerning differences in the incidence of spatial
attention biases between upper- and lower-limb patients.
For each Hand arrangement, the PSS of each CRPS pa-
tient was compared to the bootstrapped (n = 1000) 95% CI
around the mean for the controls. Each PSS was classified as
reflecting a bias of attention away from the affected side if it
was less than the lower bound of the control group’s 95%
CI. If the PSS was greater than the upper bound of the
control group’s 95% CI it was classified as reflecting a
bias of attention towards the affected side. If it was within
the bounds of the controls group’s 95% CI the PSS was
classified as reflecting no bias of attention. The individual
PSS values of patients with upper- and lower-limb CRPS are
represented in Supplementary Figs 1 and 2.
Individual patients with upper-limb CRPS were more
likely than lower-limb patients to show an attentional
bias away from the affected side. Summed across Hand
arrangement, a higher proportion of upper-limb patients
(n = 20/35) showed PSS values consistent with a significant
bias of attention away from the affected side when com-
pared
to
lower-limb
patients
[n = 8/35;
�2(1) = 8.6,
P = 0.009; Bonferroni corrected]. Patients with upper-limb
CRPS were less likely (n = 6/35) to have PSS values indicat-
ing no significant bias in attention compared to patients
with lower-limb CRPS [n = 17/35; �2(1) = 7.8, P = 0.015].
The incidence of PSS values that reflected a bias of atten-
tion towards the affected side was similar for patients with

limb CRPS [n = 10/35; �2(1) = 0.07, P = 0.788]. Individual
differences are further discussed in the Supplementary
material.
Just noticeable difference analysis
Comparison of patients with complex regional pain syndrome
and controls
Group (control versus patients) was a significant predictor
of JNDs (Table 6). The JNDs were an average of 20 ms
larger for patients (mean = 94.2 ms, SEM = 11.1) than for
controls (mean = 74.9 ms, SEM = 9.9). The second of the
two Hand arrangement terms (crossed versus no hands)
was also a significant predictor of JNDs, with JNDs an
average
of
16 ms
larger
for
the
crossed
condition
(mean = 94.2 ms, SEM = 10.0) than for the no hands con-
dition (mean = 77.8 ms, SEM = 6.5) when considered across
both Groups. Neither term for the Group � Hand arrange-
ment interaction contributed significantly to the model,
indicating that the difference in JNDs for patients with
CRPS compared to controls did not significantly vary as
a function of the Hand arrangement.
Analysis of possible predictors of patients’ just noticeable dif-
ference values
Pain intensity and weeks since diagnosis were significant
predictors (Table 7), with JNDs increasing by 14.9 ms for
every one point increase in pain and decreasing by 0.05 ms
for every week since diagnosis (2.6 ms reduction per year).
Inspection of individual patterns in just noticeable difference
values
The individual JND values of patients with upper- and
lower-limb CRPS are presented in Supplementary Figs 3
and 4. The JND for each CRPS patient for each Hand
arrangement condition was compared to the bootstrapped
(n = 1000) 95% CI around the mean for controls. There
were no differences between the patterns of deviations of
JNDs from normal between the patients with upper- and
lower-limb CRPS (Supplementary material).

 vision of the hands, and to visual information that ap-
peared in the same spatial locations but on the surface of
the hands. The main finding was that, as a group and
compared to control participants, patients with CRPS
showed a bias in covert visual attention away from the
affected side. Importantly, this bias was observed when
participants made TOJs concerning lights appearing on a
blank board. Such delayed processing of visual information
on one side of space is similar to that seen in patients with
neglect following brain injury on visual TOJ tasks (Rorden
et al., 1997; Berberovic et al., 2004; Sinnett et al., 2007).
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence that
patients with CRPS have diminished attention to the af-
fected compared to the unaffected side of space in terms
of their general sensory processing (i.e. independent of
visual or tactile bodily information).
This bias was not significantly altered when the same
TOJ task was performed with the visual information ap-
pearing on the surface of the uncrossed hands. However,
crossing the hands over to the opposite side of space sig-
nificantly reduced the patients’ bias such that it was no
longer significantly different to that of the controls. This
bias reduction (what some might term a reversal) cannot
be explained solely by a bias away from the hand on the
affected side of the body, since that would also have re-
sulted in a significant group difference, but this time with
PSS values for the patients that would be more positive
than those for the controls. Rather, the similarity of per-
formance between patients and controls when the arms
were crossed suggests that patients’ attention is biased
both away from the affected side of space and away from
the hand of the affected side of the body. When the hands
are crossed, the tendency for attention to be biased away
from the affected side of space and the tendency for atten-
tion to be biased away from the hand of the affected side of
the body cancel out (i.e. they sum to zero). Although we
believe this is the best interpretation of our results, it
should be acknowledged that a post hoc t-test that directly
compared
the
PSS
values
of
the
patients
in
the
no
hands and crossed conditions failed to reach statistical sig-
nificance. We therefore conclude that an avenue for further
research is to investigate the reliability of the change that
we have observed in patients bias relative to controls when
the hands are crossed.
In further analyses we examined which factors predicted
attention bias in patients with CRPS. We found that the
extent to which attention was directed away from the af-
fected side was predicted by scores on the CRPS BPDS
(Lewis and McCabe, 2010), a subjective measure of distor-
tions in the representation of the affected limb. One possi-
bility is that altered body representation may interfere with
the ability to process information coming from the limb and
the space that surrounds it (Farne
` et al., 2000; van der
Hoort et al., 2011; Tame
` et al., 2013; D’Amour et al.,
2015). However, such an explanation for the relationship
between body representation distortion and attention bias
is negated by the fact that the patients with CRPS showed
biased attention during the no hands condition, when the
targets did not appear on or near the hands. Some of the
unusual perceptions reported by patients with CRPS, such as
feelings of disownership of, or aversion towards, their af-
fected limb, resemble neurological delusions of body repre-
sentation
that
can
follow
brain
injury.
For
example,
asomatagnosia is the denial of ownership of a limb and
misoplegia is characterized by feelings of dislike towards a
limb (Vallar and Ronchi, 2009). Such delusions often co-
occur with neglect following brain injury (Bisiach and
Berti, 1987; Heilman et al., 2000; Loetscher et al., 2006),
which suggests that there may be overlapping cognitive and
neural bases for deficits in body representation and spatial
attention. The significant relationship between covert visual
attention and body representation in our study is consistent
with the possibility that these cognitive symptoms could also
be driven by related cortical changes in patients with CRPS.
The attentional bias of the patients was not predicted by
pain intensity or time since diagnosis, consistent with pre-
vious studies that measured spatial attention using tactile
TOJ tasks (Moseley et al., 2009; Reid et al., 2016).
Interestingly, studies that have tested attention to explicit
visual information about the affected limb found that pain
intensity and duration of symptoms significantly related to
the degree of attention bias (Reid et al., 2016). We specu-
late that tasks that use explicit visual information about the
limb could be more closely related to pain due to the
greater emphasis that they place on the affected body part.
Our group-level analysis also found the magnitude of
attentional bias was not predicted by affected limb, hand-
edness, change in handedness, or TSK scores. Nonetheless,
we do not yet eliminate the possibility that a generalized
bias in attention might be driven by an asymmetrical rep-
resentation of near space due to a tendency to favour the
unaffected limb when performing actions (e.g. due to
learned non-use; Punt et al., 2013). Our sample may have
been too small and heterogeneous to elucidate statistical
relationships between the extent of limb use and magnitude
of attention bias in the group analysis, since some patients
had both upper- and lower-limb involvement. Indeed, when
the performance of the patients was examined on an indi-
vidual basis relative to the control group, significant in-
attention to the affected side was more frequent in those
patients with predominantly upper-limb CRPS than those
with predominantly lower-limb CRPS. Furthermore, self-
report measures of current hand preference, remembered
hand preference, and fear of movement may be poor indi-
cators of asymmetries of actual hand movements in daily
life. It may yet be beneficial to further investigate whether
the covert attention bias in patients with CRPS is driven by
an asymmetrical distribution of movements. This could be
achieved through research on patients with CRPS that ex-
clusively affects one upper or one lower limb, using accel-
erometers to gain a more precise and objective measure of
the spatial distribution of actions.
Patients with CRPS had significantly larger JNDs than
control participants, indicating reduced temporal acuity.

 Since these were positively predicted by pain intensity, but
not by body perception distortion or any of our other
markers of cognitive change, these could reflect general
cognitive impairments (e.g. to sustained attention and pro-
cessing speed) that are known to accompany chronic pain
(Hart et al., 2000; Attridge et al., 2015). It could be noted
that the mean JNDs for the patients of 94 ms could be
considered large, and some of the participants had JNDs
for some conditions that were larger than the largest tem-
poral offset (i.e. 120 ms; see Supplementary Figs 3 and 4).
This indicates that in order for the participant to be able to
reliably judge the temporal order of the stimuli in these
instances, the stimuli would need to have been presented
at temporal offsets larger than the maximum offset that
was actually used in the study. In our experience it is not
unusual to observe large JNDs, particularly for crossed
hands conditions in tactile TOJ tasks, and when studying
non-expert community participants and clinical populations
who have not had a lot of training in such experimental
tasks. Previous studies using TOJ tasks have reported mean
JNDs that were similarly large relative to the maximum
temporal offset (Shore et al., 2002; Van Damme et al.,
2009). Nonetheless, we reperformed our main group ana-
lyses on a reduced dataset that excluded those conditions
for which the JNDs had exceeded 120 ms (excluding 20%
of the total data). The analysis of the reduced dataset repli-
cated our main finding, of significantly leftward PSS values
for patients with CRPS compared to controls, but this bias
did not vary between the three Hand arrangement condi-
tions. Future researchers who test patients with CRPS on
TOJ tasks and who are concerned about high JNDs might
consider using a broader range of temporal offsets, forming
a priori exclusion rules based on the JND magnitudes (De
Paepe et al., 2014), or using a procedure that adjusts tem-
poral offsets adaptively based on the participants’ responses
(Sternberg et al., 1971; Stelmach and Herdman, 1991;
Berberovic et al., 2004; Filbrich et al., 2017).
Considering that attention bias was predicted by scores
on the questionnaire measure of body perception distor-
tion, it is perhaps curious that it was not also predicted
by reaction times on the hand laterality judgement task,
an
objective
measure
of
body
representation.
Like
Reinersmann et al. (2010) we found that patients with
CRPS were significantly slower than controls in recognizing
pictures of upper limbs and that there were no differences
in their reaction times for pictures that corresponded to the
affected versus unaffected side of the body. Like the larger
JNDs compared to controls, the slower reaction times of
patients with CRPS on this hand laterality judgement task
might reflect non-specific factors such as impaired sustained
attention rather than a deficit in body representation. In
contradiction of this possibility, the patients with CRPS
in the study by Reinersmann et al. (2010) showed no def-
icits in alertness or working memory. However, we con-
ducted a follow-up analysis comparing reaction times for
patients with upper- and lower-limb CRPS in the present
study and found no difference between these groups,
whereas if the task measured limb representation we
would expect slower reaction times for the upper-limb pa-
tients. The differences in reaction times between patients
with CRPS and controls on the hand laterality judgement
task in the present study could therefore reflect non-specific
cognitive deficits rather than body representation, which
would explain why this measure did not predict attention
bias even though the scores on the CRPS BPDS did.
Overall, the present study provides the first evidence
demonstrating a bias in attention away from the affected
side in patients with CRPS that is seen in the absence of
explicit or implied information about the limbs. Although
the attention bias was not predicted by pain in the present
study, the alleviation of pain by addressing spatial attention
bias
using
prism
adaptation (Sumitani
et al.,
2007a;
Bultitude and Rafal, 2010; Christophe et al., 2016) suggests
an indirect relationship between the two. Harris (1999)
proposed that conditions such as CRPS in which symptoms
cannot be completely explained by damage to the affected
limb might arise as a result of discrepancies between sen-
sory input, movement output and movement intention.
Biased spatial attention could contribute to such discrepan-
cies by distorting or degrading the spatial and temporal
alignment of information that occurs in the affected side
of space.
In light of our and others’ findings for reduced attention
to the affected side of the body and near space, it is curious
that several studies using judgements of visual straight-
ahead based on far (2 m) visual targets have not found
evidence for a bias in attention away from the affected
side,
but
towards
the
affected
side
(Sumitani
et
al.,
2007b, 2014; Uematsu et al., 2009), or else towards the
right side of space regardless of which side of the body was
affected
by
CRPS
(Reinersmann
et
al.,
2012).
Understanding
the
contrasting
ways
in
which
spatial
biases present in different spatial reference frames in
CRPS could be critical to understanding how pain arises
in this condition, or indeed in the normal experience of
pain (Legrain et al., 2012). The contrasting findings in
near and far space also lead to the critical question of
which attention bias should be targeted for treatment. It
seems highly relevant that the spatial realignment that
occurs during prism adaptation can be observed as oppos-
ing but additive shifts in two reference frames (Redding and
Wallace, 2006). After adapting by pointing at visual targets
that are viewed through lenses that shift the visual image to
one side, the felt position of the pointing arm relative to the
body shifts in the opposite direction to the prismatic shift,
whereas judgements of visual straight ahead shift in the
same direction as the prismatic shift. This means that
prism adaptation that is designed to reorient arm move-
ments towards the affected side of near space will also
shift visual straight-ahead judgements away from the af-
fected side. Thus, it is possible that prism adaptation alle-
viates
symptoms
of
CRPS
by
reducing
both
of
the
conflicting visual biases that have been reported for these
patients.

 Since the attention bias exhibited by our patients was not
predicted by which side of the body (left or right) was most
affected, our result could indicate that biased spatial atten-
tion in CRPS arises due to changes in the dorsal attention
network. This network is present in both hemispheres and
directs attention to features on the contralateral side of
space (Corbetta and Shulman, 2002). Subtle visuospatial
impairments, such as those demonstrated by patients with
CRPS in the current study, can occur when the dorsal at-
tention network in either hemisphere is disrupted by a
lesion (List et al., 2008; Schendel et al., 2016) or using
transcranial magnetic stimulation (Walsh et al., 1999;
Dambeck et al., 2006). In contrast, the marked deficits
that constitute neglect, and that are seen with greater fre-
quency following right-hemisphere lesions, are thought to
arise due to disruption of both the dorsal attention network
and the ventral network for detecting behaviourally-rele-
vant stimuli, which is mainly lateralized to the right hemi-
sphere (Corbetta and Shulman, 2002). Within the dorsal
attention network, the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) has
been associated with allodynia and motor impairments in
CRPS (Maiho
¨fner et al., 2006, 2007; Lebel et al., 2008),
and is also part of the network of brain regions implicated
in the multisensory representation of the space near to the
body (the ‘body matrix’; Longo et al., 2010; Moseley et al.,
2011). Our study adds to previous evidence of neuropsy-
chological symptoms that suggest altered PPC function in
CRPS (Fo
¨rderreuther et al., 2004; Lewis et al., 2010;
Robinson et al., 2011; Cohen et al., 2013), and supports
the existence of a relationship between spatial attention
bias and distortion of body perception in patients with
this condition.
