Abstract
Aims/hypothesis The aim of this study was to assess the risk
of adverse perinatal outcomes in gestational diabetes mellitus
(GDM) in a large national cohort.
Methods All deliveries taking place after 22 weeks in France
in 2012 were included by extracting data from the hospital
discharge database and the national health insurance system.
The diabetic status of mothers was determined by the use of
glucose-lowering agents and by hospital diagnosis. Outcomes
were analysed according to the type of diabetes and, in the
GDM group, whether or not diabetes was insulin-treated.
Results The cohort of 796,346 deliveries involved 57,629
(7.24%) mothers with GDM. Mother–infant linkage was
obtained for 705,198 deliveries. The risks of adverse
outcomes were much lower with GDM than with
pregestational diabetes. After limiting the analysis to
deliveries after 28 weeks to reduce immortal time bias, the
risks of preterm birth (OR 1.3 [95% CI 1.3, 1.4]), Caesarean
section (OR 1.4 [95% CI 1.4, 1.4]), pre-eclampsia/eclampsia
(OR 1.7 [95% CI 1.6, 1.7]), macrosomia (OR 1.8 [95% CI 1.7,
1.8]), respiratory distress (OR 1.1 [95% CI 1.0, 1.3]), birth
trauma (OR 1.3 [95% CI 1.1, 1.5]) and cardiac malformations
(OR 1.3 [95% CI 1.1, 1.4]) were increased in women with
GDM compared with the non-diabetic population. Higher
risks were observed in women with insulin-treated GDM than
those with diet-treated GDM. After limiting the analysis to
term deliveries, an increased risk of perinatal mortality was
observed. After excluding women suspected to have
undiagnosed pregestational diabetes, the risk remained
moderately increased only for those with diet-treated GDM
(OR 1.3 [95% CI 1.0, 1.6]).
Conclusions/interpretation GDM is associated with a
moderately increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes,
which is higher in insulin-treated GDM than in non-insulin-
treated GDM for most outcomes.

Introduction
The proportions of overweight and obese women are rising in
the general population worldwide [1]. Similar trends are
observed in France, especially in women of childbearing age
[2], thus increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes before
pregnancy and the risk of developing gestational diabetes
mellitus (GDM) [3]. Moreover, the incidence of diabetes in
pregnancy is expected to increase considerably in the future
for demographic reasons.
While centre-based studies are likely to reflect the
excellence of the reporting centre, the public health
perspective requires population-based data to provide solid
estimates of complication rates and for making comparisons
among countries and populations. Although the consequences
of pregestational diabetes have been recognised for a long
time, the association between less severe glucose intolerance
and morbidity was not definitively proven prior to the
publication of findings from the Hyperglycemia and
Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes (HAPO) study [4]. However,
data on GDM derived from exhaustive national or regional
databases that link maternal and neonatal outcomes are
relatively rare [5–8], and the overall risk of morbidity of
neonates born to GDM mothers remains unclear, particularly
for neonates with congenital malformations and respiratory
distress [9]. In fact, two problems usually make data
interpretation more difficult in GDM studies: (1) the
so-called immortal time bias; and (2) the possible
contamination of GDM data by inclusion of women with
undiagnosed pregestational diabetes, who may be reclassified
after pregnancy.
We conducted a large-scale observational national study in
France using data for 2012 from the French hospital discharge
database and the French National Health Insurance system,
which include all deliveries and terminations of pregnancy
after 22 weeks for medical reasons. We used a specific
algorithm based on the use of glucose-lowering agents before,
during and after pregnancy and hospital diagnosis at delivery
to determine maternal diabetes status.
The aims of this study were to: (1) estimate the prevalence
of GDM in pregnant women in 2012 in France; (2) assess
perinatal outcomes after 22 weeks of pregnancy in the
presence of GDM compared with pregestational diabetes or
no diabetes; (3) determine whether perinatal outcomes
differed according to whether GDM was treated by insulin
or diet alone; and (4) increase the validity of conclusions by
controlling for immortal time bias and contamination by data
from women with undiagnosed pregestational diabetes.
Methods
Data sources This cross-sectional study was conducted using
combined data from the French hospital discharge database
(PMSI [Programme de Médicalisation des Systèmes
d’Information]) and the French National Health Insurance data-
base (SNIIRAM [Système National d’Information Inter-Régime
de l’Assurance Maladie]). The PMSI database provides detailed
medical information on all admissions to French public and
private hospitals, including discharge diagnoses using ICD-10
codes (www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/) and medical
procedures performed during the hospital stay. The SNIIRAM
database contains individualised and anonymous data on health-
care claims reimbursed by French National Health Insurance
covering the entire French population [10]. Information on se-
vere and costly long-term diseases is also available and coded
according to ICD-10. Use of the PMSI and SNIIRAM databases
was approved by the French Data Protection Agency
(Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés).
Study population The study included data on all deliveries
taking place after 22 weeks of pregnancy in 2012 and recorded
in the PMSI database, including terminations of pregnancy for
medical reasons. The delivery date was defined as the date of
hospital admission for the infant’s birth, when available
(88.5%); the date of the delivery procedure, when available
(11.4%); or the date of the mother’s hospital admission
(0.1%). The date of conception was calculated by using
gestational age at delivery as recorded in the database.
A new tool implemented in 2011 links maternal and
neonatal data in the PMSI database. In 2012, this tool was
available for 88.5% of delivery stays.
Algorithm for identifying maternal diabetes status An
algorithm for defining the maternal diabetes status was
developed for this study based on the use of glucose-
lowering agents before, during and after pregnancy, hospital
diagnosis at delivery, and information on long-term diseases.
The inclusion and exclusion criteria used to identify mothers
with type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes and GDM are presented
in Table 1.
GDM was classified as insulin-treated when insulin was
dispensed at least once during pregnancy.
As these criteria could not formally exclude mothers with
undiagnosed pregestational diabetes from the GDM group,
more restrictive criteria were added to exclude those classified
as having GDM if insulin or oral glucose-lowering agents had
been dispensed at least once during the year after pregnancy.
Outcomes for mothers Obstetric outcomes included preterm
delivery (<37 weeks of pregnancy), Caesarean section, and
discharge diagnosis of eclampsia or pre-eclampsia (ICD-10
codes O140, O141, O149, O15).
Diabetologia (2017) 60:636–644

 Outcomes for neonates Neonatal outcomes recorded in this
study before the infant’s discharge included macrosomia
(birthweight >90th percentile for a given gestational age);
Erb’s palsy or clavicle fracture (diagnosis with ICD-10 codes
P140, P141, P142, P143 or P134); congenital malformations
of the circulatory system (ICD-10 Q20–Q28); congenital
malformations of the nervous system (ICD-10 Q00–Q07);
perinatal death (including stillbirth and death during the birth
stay); birth asphyxia (ICD-10 code P210) and respiratory dis-
tress (ICD-10 codes P210, P283, P22 except for P221, P240,
P293).
French recommendations for the screening and treatment
of GDM Since 2010, GDM screening has been recommended
when at least one of the following criteria is present: maternal
age ≥35 years; BMI ≥25 kg/m2; history of diabetes in a
first-degree relative; personal history of GDM; and a child
with macrosomia [11, 12]. A fasting blood glucose assay
(normal <5.1 mmol/l) is recommended during the first
trimester. If findings are normal, a 75 g OGTT is indicated at
between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. GDM is diagnosed
when the fasting blood glucose level is ≥5.1 mmol/l and/or the
1 h blood glucose level is ≥10 mmol/l and/or the 2 h blood
glucose level is ≥8.5 mmol/l.
Treatment is based on diet, self-monitoring of blood
glucose levels and insulin, when indicated. Other
glucose-lowering agents are not used to treat GDM in France.
Data analysis Logistic regression models were used to
estimate the ORs and 95% CIs for associations between
maternal/neonatal outcomes and maternal diabetes status (type
1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, GDM or no diabetes), adjusted for
maternal age (≤29, 30–39, ≥40 years) and birthweight and/or
gestational age, depending on the outcomes investigated.
Absence of diabetes was used as the reference group to
calculate ORs.
A complementary analysis was carried out to study mater-
nal and neonatal outcomes associated with GDM in order to
reduce a possible immortal time bias. Immortal time refers to
the follow-up time during which, because of the exposure
definition, the outcome under study could not occur,
corresponding to the time prior to the diagnosis of GDM
[13]. As highlighted by Hutcheon et al, differences at the start
of follow-up between women with and without GDM can lead
to overestimation of the perinatal mortality rate in the
population without diabetes [14]. This bias can also affect risk
estimation for other outcomes that may occur before the start
of the GDM screening period. Consequently, two subgroup
analyses were performed to study the risk of all outcomes: one
was limited to deliveries after 28 weeks of pregnancy (the
recommended screening period for GDM) and the other was
limited to deliveries after 37 weeks of pregnancy (at term).
Three models were used for each outcome and each subgroup
analysis: (1) total GDM compared with no diabetes; (2)
insulin-treated and non-insulin-treated GDM compared with
no diabetes; and (3) insulin-treated GDM compared with
non-insulin-treated GDM. These three models were replicated
after excluding undiagnosed type 2 diabetes from GDM.
A p value <0.05 was considered to indicate statistical
significance. All statistical analyses were performed with
SAS software (version 9.2, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Data were available for 796,346 deliveries that occurred in
France in 2012. The prevalence of each subtype of diabetes
is presented in Table 2. The prevalence of GDM (as defined in

 Table 1) was 7.24%, ranging from 2.3% in women under the
age of 20 years to 16.1% for women over the age of 40 years
(electronic supplementary material [ESM] Table 1). Type 2
diabetes accounted for 60% of cases of pre-existing diabetes.
Insulin was used to treat 28.1% of women with GDM and
77% of women with type 2 diabetes.
Linked maternal and neonatal data were available for
705,198 deliveries (88.5%), corresponding to 716,152
neonates. The prevalence of GDM was 6.7% in the group of
mothers for whom neonatal data were not available.
Maternal and neonatal outcomes among all deliveries are
presented in Table 3. The risks of Caesarean section,
eclampsia/pre-eclampsia and preterm birth were higher in
the GDM group than in the no diabetes group. The risks of
all adverse neonatal outcomes studied were also significantly
increased in the presence of GDM, except for the risk of
nervous system malformations (which was unchanged) and
the risk of death (which was significantly decreased).
Compared with the pregestational diabetes groups, the risks
of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes were lower in the
GDM group.
In order to avoid immortal time bias, the analysis was
limited to deliveries after 28 weeks. We also conducted an
analysis of deliveries after 37 weeks to determine the risk of
adverse outcomes in term deliveries. In each subgroup,
maternal and neonatal outcomes were compared with the
population without diabetes, and according to whether or not
diabetes was insulin-treated (Tables 4 and 5).
For deliveries after 28 weeks, risks for maternal and
neonatal outcomes in the presence of GDM were similar to
those reported in Table 3, except that the risk of respiratory
distress was lower (OR 1.1 [95% CI 1.0, 1.3] vs OR 1.3 [95%
CI 1.2, 1.3]) and the risk of perinatal death, which was no
longer decreased compared with the no diabetes group.
The risks of Caesarean section, delivery before 37 weeks
and macrosomia were higher in the insulin-treated GDM
group than in the non-insulin-treated GDM group. The excess
risk of cardiac malformations and respiratory distress
observed in the GDM group was also due to the insulin-
treated GDM group.
In deliveries after 37 weeks of pregnancy, we found a 30%
increase in the OR for perinatal death in the GDM group
compared with the no diabetes group. This risk was similar
whether or not the diabetes was insulin-treated. No significant
differences were observed for the other outcomes in deliveries
after 28 weeks.
As the unexpected increased risk of mortality at term
observed in the GDM group might be due to undiagnosed
pregestational diabetes in this group, we repeated the analyses
using more restrictive criteria to exclude women classified as
having GDM but to whom insulin or oral glucose-lowering
agents were dispensed at least once during the year after preg-
nancy. This analysis excluded 1376 women in the group of
deliveries after 28 weeks (6.8% in the insulin-treated group
and 0.7% in the non-insulin-treated group), and 1171 women
in the group of deliveries after 37 weeks (7.3% in the insulin-
treated group and 0.64% in the non-insulin-treated group).
The characteristics of these women are presented in ESM
Table 2.
In this restricted GDM group, the risk of respiratory
distress among deliveries after 28 weeks (ESM Table 3) and
the risk of perinatal death among deliveries after 37 weeks
(ESM Table 4) in the insulin-treated group were no longer
significantly increased (OR 1.0 [95% CI 0.9, 1.1] and OR
0.9 [95% CI 0.6, 1.5], respectively). However, the risk of
perinatal death among deliveries after 37 weeks remained
moderately increased in the non-insulin-treated group (OR
1.3 [95% CI 1.0, 1.6]). Table 6 summarises the outcomes that
were significantly increased in the insulin-treated group
compared with the non-insulin-treated group.
Finally, we hypothesised that the risk of death in the
non-insulin-treated group may be related to a later term of
delivery compared with the insulin-treated group. We
therefore compared the distribution of gestational age at
delivery in the group of deliveries after 37 weeks according
to maternal treatment. Women with GDM who did not receive
insulin treatment delivered later than those who did (Fig. 1).
Similar values were observed after excluding women to whom
insulin or glucose-lowering agents were dispensed during the
year following delivery.
Discussion
On the basis of the analysis of data for 2012 obtained from a
large-scale, nationwide, exhaustive database in France, we
confirm that GDM is associated with lower risks for maternal
and neonatal complications compared with pregestational
diabetes. However, we show that: (1) the risk of cardiac
malformations is increased for women with insulin-treated
GDM, whereas the risk of nervous system malformations is
not; (2) the risk of respiratory distress is also increased for this
subgroup of insulin-treated women with GDM; and (3) the

This is the first nationwide study to evaluate the effect of
diabetes on pregnancy in France based on a combination of
maternal and neonatal data. The strengths of our study are that
we had access to data concerning 796,346 deliveries and
combined maternal and neonatal data for 88.5% of these
deliveries, and that women were accurately classified with
various types of diabetes during pregnancy. This classification
allowed us to analyse outcomes in a large GDM cohort
according to whether or not diabetes was insulin-treated and
in a second analysis to avoid ‘contamination’ of GDM data by
the presence of women with undiagnosed pregestational dia-
betes. Furthermore, by taking the immortality bias into
account (which is not usually done), we considerably
increased the robustness of our results. We also analysed the

 outcomes in term pregnancies (≥37 weeks) in order to alert
clinic and primary hospital physicians to risks potentially
related to GDM at term.
A weakness of our study is that we did not have access to
data for 11.5% of neonates. Another limitation is the absence
of data on glycaemic control in patients and other
comorbidities such as maternal BMI.
The validity of the PMSI database has been regularly
audited, especially in terms of perinatal data [15, 16]:
prematurity and Caesarean section, for example, are well
documented. However, data on maternal morbidity appear to
be less comprehensive, as indicated by a sensitivity of 73% for
GDM. Coding errors concerning the diagnosis of diabetes in
the PMSI database were therefore corrected by the algorithm
based on medication use.
The prevalence of GDM in France in 2012 was 7.24%,
which was lower than that reported in other countries: recently
reported GDM prevalence rates of 15% in the USA [17] and

 13% in Australia [18] were similar to those observed in the
HAPO study population [19]. However, in France, experts
recommend restricting GDM screening to women presenting
with certain risk factors, which could explain the lower
prevalence in this study [11].
In a recent large-scale, nationwide Danish cohort, the risk
of cardiac malformations was moderately increased in GDM
pregnancies [20]. We found similar results, but showed that
this increase was significant only in women with insulin-
treated GDM. The excess risk of cardiac malformations
observed in this group persisted after the exclusion of women
with undiagnosed pregestational diabetes, indicating that
mechanisms other than periconceptional maternal blood
glucose levels may increase the risk of cardiac malformations
[21]. In addition to the severity of diabetes, pre-pregnancy
BMI in mothers with GDM was previously shown to be a
predictor of congenital malformations in infants [22]. Other
teams have shown that high maternal BMI is associated with
an increased risk of malformations that is independent of
maternal blood glucose levels [23, 24]. We can hypothesise

 that the increased risk of cardiac malformations in women with
insulin-treated GDM may be partly associated with maternal
obesity, although maternal BMI was not recorded in the national
database used for this study. We found that GDM did not alter
the risk of nervous system malformations. The incidence of
these malformations was much lower than the incidence of car-
diac malformations, as previously reported by other authors [22,
25]. One hypothesis is that early hyperglycaemic exposure of
the embryo has different teratogenic effects on cardiac and
nervous system tissues. Nervous system malformations may
also be associated with an increased risk of miscarriage or a
higher rate of termination of pregnancy before 22 weeks, which
was not taken into account in this study.
The relationship between maternal GDM and the risk of
neonatal respiratory distress has not been clearly established
[26]. Data from our study clearly suggest an increased risk of
neonatal respiratory distress in the insulin-treated GDM
group, and this risk was also increased for deliveries after
37 weeks. It is likely that, in the setting of very preterm
delivery, lung immaturity remains the leading risk factor for
respiratory distress irrespective of the presence or absence of
diabetes in pregnancy. On the other hand, poorly managed
maternal diabetes has been shown to be associated with
delayed appearance of phosphatidylglycerol (a main
compound of pulmonary surfactant) in amniotic fluid after
34 weeks of pregnancy [27]. Target glycaemic levels are often
more difficult to attain in insulin-treated women with GDM
than in diet-treated women. A recent study reported that
insulin-treated diabetes was an independent risk factor for
respiratory distress in neonates born after 33 weeks in a group
of women with pregestational diabetes or GDM [28].
Whether or not GDM is associated with an increased risk of
perinatal mortality remains a controversial subject. Most
recent studies have indicated the absence of increased risk
[5, 8], but these studies did not take immortality bias into
account. In the study by Hutcheon et al [14], the RR for
stillbirth among women with GDM was 1.25 in analyses
limited to births after 28 weeks. In our study, the risk of
perinatal mortality was not increased among deliveries after
28 weeks: surprisingly, it was increased only among deliveries
after 37 weeks, whether or not women were insulin-treated.
However, the 30% increase in RR remains proportionally low:
0.21% in GDM deliveries vs 0.15% in no diabetes deliveries.
After excluding women with undiagnosed pregestational
diabetes, the risk of perinatal death in deliveries after 37 weeks
in the insulin-treated group was no longer increased, although
excess risk persisted in the non-insulin-treated group. Cundy
et al reported that, after excluding newly diagnosed type 2
diabetes from the GDM group, the perinatal mortality rate
was no longer increased [29]. The increased risk of perinatal
mortality observed in the group of women with GDM treated
exclusively by diet is more difficult to explain. Perinatal
deaths could be secondary to longer exposure to
hyperglycaemia, as we found that non-insulin-treated women
with GDM had a later term of delivery compared with insulin-
treated women. Other authors have shown that women with
GDM are more likely than women without diabetes to
experience stillbirth after 35 weeks, suggesting the existence
of a mortality benefit in delivering women with GDM at
39 weeks instead of continuing with expectant management [30].
Conclusion We have clearly demonstrated that GDM is a
disease related to adverse pregnancy outcomes and that most
of the risks are higher in women with insulin-treated GDM.
By restricting analysis to deliveries after 37 weeks and
excluding cases of undiagnosed pregestational diabetes, we
identified a moderate increase in perinatal mortality in
non-insulin-treated women with GDM. Although more
investigation is needed, this study helps illuminate the
controversy about timing of delivery in GDM pregnancy.
