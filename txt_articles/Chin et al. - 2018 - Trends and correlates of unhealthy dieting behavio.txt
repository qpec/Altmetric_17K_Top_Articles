Abstract
Background: The increase in adiposity problems among United States adolescents has been accompanied by
persistently high prevalence of unhealthy dieting behaviours (UDBs) such as fasting, taking diet pills/powders/
liquids, and vomiting/taking laxatives. This study aimed to examine the associations of self-perceptions of weight
status, weight change intentions (WCIs) and UDBs with sex, age and race, as well as trends of UDBs in American
adolescents across the weight spectrum.
Methods: Data come from the biennial cross-sectional, school-based surveys, the Youth Risk Behaviour Surveillance
System (1999–2013, n = 113,542). The outcome measures were the self-reported UDBs: fasting for 24 h or more;
taking diet pills/powders/liquids; and vomiting/taking laxatives. Sex-stratified logistic regressions assessed relationships
between weight status misperceptions across all weight statuses, race and WCIs with UDBs. Differential trends between
races were assessed using race*year interaction terms.
Results: In males, all non-White races had higher odds of fasting and vomiting/taking laxatives than Whites
(except fasting in Hispanic/Latinos), with Adjusted Odds Ratios (AORs) between 1.44 and 2.07. In females, Black/
African Americans and Hispanic/Latinos had lower odds of taking diet pills/powders/liquids compared to Whites
(AORs 0.50 and 0.78 respectively). Racial disparities persisted throughout the study period. Prevalence of fasting
and vomiting/taking laxatives did not change between 1999 and 2013 for all races, while taking diet pills/powders/
liquids decreased. Compared to individuals of normal weight who were accurate weight status perceivers, individuals
of almost all other combinations of weight status and weight status perception had significantly higher odds of
displaying any UDB outcome. Overestimation of weight status was found to be the strongest determinant of UDBs.
Compared to individuals endorsing "not wanting to do anything" about their weight, individuals endorsing all other
WCIs (including wanting to gain weight) also showed significantly higher odds for every UDB outcome, with wanting
to lose weight having AORs of the greatest magnitudes.
Conclusions: Prevalence of UDBs is persistently high, and highest among females across all racial groups. UDBs may
elevate undesired weight gain and weight loss in individuals who are obese/overweight and underweight respectively.
Further research into weight status perceptions among adolescents may inform efforts to reduce UDBs.

 Background
Obesity has been steadily rising among adolescents in
the United States (US) in the previous three decades
with almost a fifth of all US youth aged 12–19 years
now being obese [1]. Deviations from a healthy weight
additionally include being underweight, which is also
detrimental to health [2]. In the US prevalence of ado-
lescent obesity, overweight, and underweight is an esti-
mated 17.2%, 16.2%, and 3.8% respectively. Obesity is
associated with metabolic syndrome and several cancers
[3], while underweight is associated with higher rates of
respiratory, intestinal, and reproductive problems [4].
Obesity has been found to be more prevalent among males
and ethnic minorities, especially Black/African Americans
and Hispanics/Latinos [1]. Meta-analyses suggest that
current weight change programmes based on diet and ex-
ercise education vary in effectiveness and show high het-
erogeneity in results [5], with comprehensive behavioral
family lifestyle interventions showing promising results
[6]. Weight status perceptions are strong motivators of
intention to lose weight among adults [7, 8] and weight
status misperception is a stronger predictor of weight
change intentions (WCIs) than actual body weight [9]
among adolescents. It has been documented that ado-
lescents who perceive themselves as overweight are
more likely to report trying to lose weight and those
who perceive themselves as underweight more likely to
report trying to gain weight, regardless of their actual
weight status [10].
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
estimate that close to one in two high school students in
the US are trying to lose weight [11]. Intentions to lose
weight are closely associated with unhealthy dieting
behaviours (UDBs), including fasting or purging after
meals via vomiting and taking laxatives [12]. UDBs have
been suggested to be risk factors of several eating disor-
ders (EDs), namely anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa,
which result in undesirable weight loss [13, 14]. At the
same time, individuals with obesity with the intention to
lose weight are also more likely to attempt it through
UDBs [15]. These UDBs are linked to potentially dan-
gerous outcomes for individuals who are underweight,
and are ineffective for long-term weight loss for per-
sons with overweight [16, 17].
Hence monitoring trends and associations of UDBs
over time is important to inform public health policies.
The most recent data from the Youth Risk Behaviour
Surveillance System (YRBSS) have not been used for this
purpose [18, 19]. Additionally, the majority of studies
have focused on people with overweight and obesity and
so there is a paucity of literature analysing effects on
underweight people [20, 21]. This study attempts to fill
these gaps by using the latest YRBSS data to examine
the associations of self-perceptions of weight, weight
change intentions (WCIs) and UDBs with sex, age and
race, as well as trends of UDBs in American adolescents
across the weight spectrum.
Methods
Study design and population
We used data from the YRBSS, which is a biennial
cross-sectional, school-based survey developed by the
CDC in 1990. All survey cycles took place over a one-
year period and results were published in June of the
following
year.
It
provides
comparable
health
and
health-risk behaviour data for a representative sample of
American high schoolers [22]. The sample population
includes all public and private schools with enrolled stu-
dents in at least one of grades 9 to 12 in all 50 states of
the US, and the District of Columbia. A more detailed
account of the sampling methods is published on the
CDC website [23]. All eight waves of the survey that in-
cluded questions on UDBs (1999; 2001; 2003; 2005;
2007; 2009; 2011; and 2013) were analysed. The total
sample size was n = 117,540 participants, with the
smallest sample (n = 13,583) in 2013 and the largest
(n = 16,410) in 2009.
Levels of missing data ranged from 0.35% for age to 2.
71% for fasting and a final sample size of n = 113,542
was used in this analysis after excluding missing re-
sponses. All data were anonymized and publicly avail-
able; hence no ethical approval was required.
Measures
Body mass index (BMI) and weight status
BMI was calculated using self-reported height and
weight, then compared against the age- and sex-
specific distribution of BMI in adolescence. Under-
weight was defined as a BMI < 5th percentile, normal
weight as 5th ≤ BMI < 85th percentile, overweight as
85th ≤ BMI < 95th percentile, and obese as BMI ≥ 95th
percentile [24].
Weight change intentions
WCIs were recorded using the item “Which of the
following are you trying to do about your weight?”, and
participants answered either “Lose weight”, “Gain weight”,
“Stay the same weight”, or “I am not trying to do anything
about my weight”. Binary variables of each option (Yes/
No) were created and used as outcomes. Responses were
also coded into a categorical explanatory variable for all
UDB outcomes, with “I am not trying to do anything
about my weight” as the reference category [25].
Unhealthy dieting behaviours
UDBs were assessed using 3 separate items “During the
past 30 days, did you (i) go without eating for 24 hours
or more (also called fasting) (ii) take any diet pills,
Chin et al. BMC Public Health  (2018) 18:439 
Page 2 of 8
 powders, or liquids (PPLs) without a doctor's advice (iii)
vomit or take laxatives, to lose weight or to keep from
gaining weight?” [25]. Participants were required to
respond Yes/No to each question.
Weight status misperceptions
Weight status perception was assessed by the question
“How do you describe your weight?” and participants
responded on a 5-point scale: very underweight, slightly
underweight, about the right weight, slightly overweight,
and very overweight [25]. Very and slightly underweight
were grouped together as “Underweight”. We assessed if
they had accurate perceptions (perceptions matching
calculated weight status), or had weight misperceptions
(discordance between perception and calculated weight
status). Direction of misperceptions was operationalised
as “overestimated” and “underestimated” if perceptions
were higher or lower than calculated weight status re-
spectively. A variable containing all 10 possible combina-
tions of participant weight status (normal, underweight,
overweight, obese) and weight status perception (accur-
ate, underestimate, overestimate) was created to assess
relationships across the spectrum of weight status per-
ceptions. Healthy weight status with accurate perception
was used as the reference category for this variable.
Socio-demographic variables
Participants also reported their age (14 years old or
younger, 15, 16, 17, and 18 years old or older), sex (Male,
Female) and race. Race was recorded as seven distinct
categories in the survey, namely (i) White, (ii) Black/
African American, (iii) Hispanic/Latino, (iv) American
Indian/Alaska Native, (v) Asian, (vi) Native Hawaiian/
Other Pacific Islander, and (vii) Multiple- Non-Hispanic
[25]. The last four groups were collapsed into one group
due to their small sample sizes, hence race was analysed
in four categories (White, Black/African American,
Hispanic/Latino, All other races).
Statistical analyses
Logistic regression models were fitted to assess time
trends of (i) overall UDBs, (ii) fasting, (iii) taking diet
pills/powders/liquids and (iv) vomiting/taking laxatives
(adjusted for age, race, WCIs, weight status perceptions
and weight status). Effect modification by sex was identi-
fied and therefore, results are presented stratified by sex.
Trends over time were analysed using the survey years
as a linear time variable by using orthogonal coefficients
which reflected the biennial spacing of the surveys;
quadratic time variables were included in preliminary
models but did not yield statistically significant results
and were dropped from the final models. To examine
potentially differential time trends between races, all lo-
gistic regression models contained an interaction term
between race and calendar year. Adjusted Odds Ratios
(AORs) for ‘year’ are interpreted as changes in the
adjusted odds of reporting a UDB for each additional
calendar year. Sampling weights provided by the CDC
were used in order to account for an ethnic minority
oversampling to compensate for nonresponse bias, and
all reported proportions are weighted accordingly. All
analyses were conducted with STATA 14.0.
Results
The characteristics of the sample population are found
in Table 1. The proportion of females overestimating
their weight status was 21.9% in 1999 and 15.9% in
2013, while that of males was 6.9% in 1999 and 6.1% in
2013. Underestimation of weight status among females
was 21.2% in 1999 and 25.0% in 2013, while in males
was 30.6% in 1999 and 40.2% in 2013. Throughout the
period assessed, 59%–63% of females and 26%–33% of
males wanted to lose weight, while 6%–10% of females
and 26%–30% of males wanted to gain weight.
Unhealthy dieting Behaviours
The proportion of males performing at least one UDB to
lose or maintain weight in the last 30 days was 10.4% in
1999 and 10.1% in 2013, while in females it was 26.2% in
1999 and 22.7% in 2013. In males, Black/African Ameri-
cans were more likely to perform all UDBs except taking
diet PPL compared to Whites (Table 2). Every other ra-
cial group also showed higher odds of vomiting/taking
laxatives, and ‘All other races’ had higher odds of fasting
compared to Whites (AOR 1.44, 95% CI 1.02–2.03). In
females, however, the only racial disparities were in
Black/African Americans and Hispanic/Latinos having
lower odds of taking diet PPL compared to Whites
(AOR 0.50, 95% CI 0.38–0.67 and AOR 0.78, 95% CI
0.63–0.96 respectively) (Table 3).
After stratifying by sex and adjusting for age, race, and
weight status misperceptions by weight status, associa-
tions of WCIs with UDBs were explored. Compared with
not trying to do anything about weight, every other WCI
showed significantly higher odds for almost all UDB out-
comes, with wanting to lose weight having the highest
AORs. This ranged from AOR 2.27 (95% CI 1.66–3.09)
for vomiting/taking laxatives in males (Table 2) to AOR
9.28 (95% CI 7.09–12.14) for vomiting/taking laxatives
in females (Table 3). The only exception was for fasting
in males who wanted to gain weight, which showed no
statistically significant difference in odds to the WCI
reference category (Table 2).
Compared with normal weight status participants who
had an accurate perception of their weight status, most
other categories were more likely to have performed an
UDB the past 30 days among both males and females.
Individuals with overweight and obesity and those who

 overestimated their weight status were in general the
most likely to have fasted, vomited/taken laxatives or
taken any diet PPL (Tables 2 and 3).
Time trends
Racial differential time trends were varied for the dif-
ferent UDB outcomes. For both sexes, fasting and
vomiting/taking laxatives showed no statistically sig-
nificant time trends across all races. Taking diet PPL in
both sexes exhibited statistically significantly decreas-
ing trends (Males: AOR 0.96, 95% CI 0.94–0.98; Fe-
males: AOR 0.93, 95% CI 0.91–0.95 per calendar year)
(Tables 2 and 3) and there were no statistically signifi-
cant racial differences in the slope of this decline. Al-
though the overall decline for vomiting/taking laxatives in
females was not statistically significant, Hispanic/Latino
females had a statistically significantly gentler decline
(AOR 1.04, p-value for difference 0.006).
Discussion
This nationally representative study has found that
prevalence of Unhealthy Dieting Behaviours is persist-
ently high among US adolescents and was highest
among females across all racial groups. Types of UDBs
differed by racial groups, although the prevalence of
overall UDBs were comparable across the races, and
there was a lack of significant differential time trends
among races. These findings are largely consistent with
other large scale adolescent studies and support current
literature in highlighting the sex and racial differences in
UDBs [16]. These differences are of concern as UDBs
are associated with undesired weight gain and weight
loss in individuals with obesity/overweight and under-
weight respectively, thus exacerbating weight misman-
agement. This study also showed that weight status
underestimation and desire to gain weight were not pro-
tective against UDBs when compared to normal weight
accurate weight status perceivers who did not want to
do anything about their weight.
UDBs paradoxically lead to further weight gain as
short-term UDBs may divert adolescents away from
more effective long-term weight management practices
[16, 17]. It has been hypothesised that the weight gain is
due to the association of UDBs with ineffective weight-
loss behaviours [16]. These include skipping breakfast,
decreasing fruit and vegetable consumption, and redu-
cing physical activity, all of which have been shown to
be linked to weight gain [26–28]. This might be particu-
larly detrimental to adolescents who are overweight
since further weight gain may trigger even more UDB
practices if desire to lose weight intensifies. As UDBs are
predictors of both EDs and weight loss/gain, they are

 potentially detrimental to adolescents who are both
underweight or obese/overweight.
This analysis also found significant racial disparities in
UDBs. The generally higher socioeconomic status (SES)
of Whites [29] may provide them with greater access to
diet PPL than other races due to the cost of those prod-
ucts, compared to fasting and vomiting which involve no
monetary cost. These UDB disparities are troubling since
fasting and purging behaviours have been reported to be
important precursors of anorexia nervosa and bulimia
nervosa respectively [30]. Cultural beliefs and body im-
ages in different cultures may also be a factor, although
we found no racial disparities in the overall prevalence
of UDBs. We found that there were no racially differen-
tial time trends in UDBs from 1999 to 2013, with the ex-
ception of Hispanic/Latino females who had worsening
trends in vomiting/taking laxatives compared to Whites.
The lack of significant differential time trends among
races indicates a persistence in racial disparities, which
predominantly disadvantage minority groups.
The association between wanting to lose weight and
UDBs was much stronger in females than in males,
which may indicate a difference in the magnitude of the
impact that weight loss intentions have between sexes.
Interestingly, we found that with the exception of fasting
in males, all those who wanted to gain weight also dis-
played higher odds of UDBs compared to the WCI refer-
ent. This could be due to adolescent males wanting to
gain muscle mass but lose fat mass, resulting in them
participating in UDBs to lose fat despite wanting to gain
weight overall. However, this result requires further in-
vestigation. Overall though, it is consistent with the mes-
sage that those not intending to do anything about
weight are the least likely to exhibit UDBs.
Prior research has shown that in adolescents with
overweight/obesity weight loss attempts are less likely
among those who underestimate their weight status,
compared to those with accurate perceptions [31, 32].
Underestimating the weight status has also been found
to be protective against a number of disordered eating

 behaviours among adolescents with overweight/obesity
[33]. Our study included individuals across the weight
spectrum and we have further adjusted for WCIs; hence,
similar direct comparisons within the group of adoles-
cents with overweight/obesity are not straightforward.
However, we found that the desire to lose weight was as-
sociated with all UDBs in both males and females, which
may highlight a pathway that could explain both our
findings and those from the studies mentioned above.
Implications for research and practice
Taking the implications of this study’s findings on the
whole, targeting UDBs by tackling the high weight sta-
tus misperception and inappropriate WCI levels could
mitigate weight mismanagement among US adoles-
cents. Thus, public health recommendations could in-
clude providing quality health education in schools
regarding what accurate definitions of normal weight
are. This would be essential in abating weight misper-
ception [34]. However, systemic factors may affect an
individual’s weight status perception and WCI. Social en-
vironmental factors such as media depiction of normal
weight can lead to negative body image and weight obses-
sion. Such issues could potentially be addressed though
fostering school environments that discourage compari-
sons and teasing of body shapes and sizes [35]. The aim of
public health interventions to alleviate weight mismanage-
ment can be assisted by reducing UDBs.
Additionally, the persistently high prevalence of UDBs
among adolescents may warrant more focus on strategies
explicitly aiming to reduce UDBs on top of the current
practice of promoting healthy dieting or exercise regimes.
To ensure proper weight control techniques, weight
management programmes could also warn adolescents
about the ineffective and harmful consequences of UDB
practices.
Strengths and limitations
This is the first national study to examine weight status
misperceptions, WCIs and UDBs among US adolescents

 across the weight spectrum. We used a large representa-
tive sample of the US student population across 14 years;
however, the cross-sectional nature of the study pre-
cludes us from making causal inferences. Longitudinal
research would be needed to elucidate reasons behind
observed correlates and trends. Additionally, YRBSS uses
self-reported height and weight which has been shown
to lead to an underestimation of obesity prevalence in
Europe [36, 37] and the US [38] by up to 12 percentage
points. This might thereby bring in misclassification bias
by underestimating weight status misperceptions as well.
UDB data were also collected via self-reporting which
might result in an over or under-reporting of UDBs.
However, the YRBSS has undergone multiple test-
retest reliability assessments and shown acceptable
levels of validity [39]. Finally, the YRBSS lacks some
socio-demographic variables that might influence the
strength of the association and trends found in this
study. Such variables include the students’ SES and
parental income, both of which have been found to in-
fluence obesity rates and weight status perception [40].
Conclusion
This study found weight status misperceptions in adoles-
cents across all weight statuses and WCIs to be associ-
ated with higher UDBs. Apart from a slight decline in
diet PPL use, these behaviours have been persistent be-
tween 1999 and 2013. Racial disparities in the prevalence
of different UDB types were also observed, with no im-
provements over time. As UDBs have been previously
established to increase undesired weight gain and weight
loss in individuals who are obese/overweight and under-
weight respectively, its reduction is likely to address
weight mismanagement at both ends. Hence, current
trends are concerning, and concerted action will be
needed on a number of levels. Public health policies
might aim for adolescents to improve weight status per-
ception accuracy to potentially reduce inappropriate
weight preoccupation and subsequently UDBs.
