Reoperation and Medicare Expenditures
After Laparoscopic Gastric Band Surgery
Andrew M. Ibrahim, MD, MSc; Jyothi R. Thumma, MPH; Justin B. Dimick, MD, MPH
IMPORTANCE Following the US Food and Drug Administration approval for laparoscopic
gastric band surgery in 2001, as many as 96 000 devices have been placed annually. The
reported rates of reoperation range from 4% to 60% in short-term studies; however, to our
knowledge, few long-term population-level data on outcomes or expenditures are known.
OBJECTIVE To describe the rate of device-related reoperations occurring after laparoscopic
gastric band surgery as well as the associated payments in a longitudinal national cohort.
DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective review of 25 042 Medicare
beneficiaries who underwent gastric band placement between 2006 and 2013 identifies
gastric band–related reoperations, including device removal, device replacement, or revision
to a different bariatric procedure (eg, a gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy). The rates of
reoperation were risk adjusted using a multivariable logistic regression model that included
patient age, sex, race/ethnicity, Elixhauser comorbidities, and the year that the operation
was performed.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Rate of device-related reoperation nationally and across
individual hospital referral regions. Thirty-day total episode Medicare payments to hospitals
for the index operation and any subsequent reoperations.
RESULTS Of the 25 042 patients who underwent gastric band placement, 20 687 (82.61%)
were white, 18 143 (72.45%) were women, and the mean age was 57.56 years. Patients
(mean age, 57.5; 76.2% women) requiring reoperation had lower rates of hypertension
(64.9% vs 73.4%; P < .001) and diabetes (40.4% vs 44.6%; P < .001) and were more likely
to have their index operation at a for-profit hospital (34.6% vs 22.0%; P < .001). With an
average of 4.5-year follow-up, 4636 patients (18.5%) underwent 17 539 reoperations (an
average of 3.8 procedures/patient). Hospital referral regions demonstrated a 2.9-fold
variation in risk- and reliability-adjusted rates of reoperation (lower quartile average, 13.3%;
upper quartile average, 39.1%). During the study period, Medicare paid $470 million for
laparoscopic gastric band associated procedures, of which $224 million (47.6%) of the
payments were for reoperations. From 2006 to 2013, the proportion of payments from
Medicare for reoperations increased from 16.4% to 77.3% of their annual spending on the
gastric band device.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among Medicare beneficiaries undergoing gastric band
surgery, device-related reoperation was common, costly, and varied widely across hospital
referral regions. These findings suggest that payers should reconsider their coverage of the
gastric band device.

F
ollowing the approval of the laparoscopic gastric band
to treat morbid obesity by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) in 2001,1 as many as 96 000
devices have been placed annually.2 When the gastric band
malfunctions (eg, the band erodes into the stomach or slips
down and causes obstruction) or the patient has not achieved
the expected weight loss, a reoperation is indicated to re-
place or remove the band. Although these safety and effec-
tiveness concerns have contributed to decreasing the de-
vice’
s popularity, the American Society for Metabolic and
Bariatric Surgery estimates that more than 11 000 devices were
placed in 2015.3 In fact, the FDA expanded their indications
for the device to patients with a body mass index (calculated
as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared)
of more than 30, making an estimated 19 million Americans
able to have the gastric band placed who would not be
eligible for other bariatric procedures.4,5
To our knowledge, despite the continued use of the
gastric band to treat morbid obesity, limited population-level
data exist about the safety and costs of the device. Short-
term trials to approve and expand indications for the device
reported reoperation rates as low as 4%.4 Meanwhile, single-
institution cohort studies and small trials vary widely in their
results but have raised concerns by detecting reoperation
rates as high as 60%.6-12 Each of these studies lack either an
adequate sample size, long-term follow-up, or geographic rep-
resentations to provide a population estimate. Moreover, none
have assessed the downstream financial burden on payers for
subsequent device-related procedures. Thus, whether these
high rates of reoperation are representative throughout the
country and what the costs are for payers remain unknown.
The purpose of this analysis was to describe reopera-
tions that occur after a gastric band placement among a geo-
graphically representative cohort with long-term follow-up.
By using longitudinal data from a national payer (ie, Medi-
care claims), this study also assessed the associated payer
expenditures.
Methods
Data Sources
The Medicare Provider Analysis and Review file from the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services was used to ob-
tain data on patients between 2006 and 2013. This repre-
sented 8 years of the most recent data while also providing ad-
equate long-term follow-up. Moreover, this was a period after
gastric band devices had already been modified to their sec-
ond and third generation, representing the gastric bands that
are currently used.13 The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services is the largest insurer in the United States and covers
payments for approximately 15% of bariatric procedures.14
Hospital-level data were obtained from the Annual
Survey administered by the American Hospital Association.15
The 2 data sets were linked by their hospital provider num-
ber. This study was approved by the University of Michigan
institutional review board and was deemed exempt from
additional review because of the use of secondary data.
Identification of Procedures and Cohort
Procedure codes from the International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Edition, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) were
used to identify patients who underwent laparoscopic gastric
band surgery (ICD-9-CM code 44.95) who had also received a
concurrent diagnosis code for obesity (ICD-9-CM codes 278.0,
278.01, 278.02, and V77.8). Patients who had gastric or small-
intestine malignancies were excluded as they may undergo
reoperation for reasons that are not device related.
Outcome Variables
Reoperation
The primary outcome variable in this study was gastric band
device-related reoperation. The reoperation procedures were
selected based on previous reports examining the same
outcome.8-12Forthisstudy,reoperationwasdefinedasanysur-
gery occurring after the index operation with Current Proce-
duralTerminologycodesforgastricbandremoval,gastricband
replacement, or revision to a different bariatric procedure (eg,
sleevegastrectomyorRoux-en-Ygastricbypass).Notably,band
size adjustment by accessing the port was not included in the
reoperationdefinition,asthisisoftendoneinanoutpatientclinic
setting and is an expected aspect of managing the device. A full
table of the Current Procedural Terminology codes used for this
study can be found in the eTable in the Supplement.
Geographic Variation
This study also describes the geographic variation in gastric
band device-related reoperation rates across the United
States. Variations were assessed at the level of hospital refer-
ral regions as defined by the Dartmouth Atlas.16 Each hospi-
tal referral region represents a collection of zip codes where
patients are most likely to be referred for hospital care.
Patients were assigned to a hospital referral region based
on where they underwent their index operation.
Medicare Payments
Medicare payments from the Medicare Provider Analysis and
Review file were used to understand the financial implica-
tions of gastric band–related reoperations. Because wide varia-
tion exists in hospital charges, this analysis used actual
Key Points
Question How often does device-related reoperation occur after
laparoscopic gastric band surgery and what are the associated
expenditures for payers?
Findings In this study of 25 042 Medicare beneficiaries who had
the gastric band placed between 2006 and 2013, 4636 patients
(18.5%) underwent 17 539 reoperations (an average of 3.8
procedures/patient). During the study period, Medicare paid
$470 million for laparoscopic gastric band–associated procedures,
of which $224 million (47.6%) of the payments were

payments to most accurately reflect the expense to Medicare.
The total episode payments included payments for inpatient
care, outpatient care, carrier costs (ie, physician), home health
care, care in a skilled nursing facility, a long stay in a hospital,
and durable medical equipment files. Following methods pre-
viouslydescribedtouseclaimsdataforsurgicalprocedures,17,18
payments were grouped into the following discrete catego-
ries: index hospitalization, readmissions, physician services,
and postdischarge ancillary care. Each total episode of care for
the index operation and any subsequent reoperations in-
cluded payments for the initial admission and care up to 30
days after discharge.
Statistical Analysis
The first step of this analysis was to compare the patient and
hospital characteristics for patients who did and did not un-
dergo a gastric band–related reoperation. Patient characteris-
tics included age, sex, race/ethnicity, and comorbidities. Hos-
pitalcharacteristicsincludedownershipstatus,size,geographic
region, teaching status, and staffing ratios. They were com-
pared using χ2and Wilcoxon rank sum tests as appropriate.
The next aim of this analysis was to evaluate the geo-
graphic variation in the rates of reoperation. Because pa-
tients may differ across hospital referral regions in ways that
may influence their likelihood of having a reoperation, the rate
of reoperation was risk-adjusted using a multivariable regres-
sion model that included age, sex, race/ethnicity, and comor-
bidities as described by Elixhauser19 and Southern et al.20 The
year that the operation was performed was also included in the
regression model to account for possible secular trends.
Therateofreoperationforeachhospitalreferralregionwas
also reliability-adjusted. Because hospital referral regions have
different case volumes, the observed rate of reoperation in
lower-volumeregionsismorelikelytoreflect“statisticalnoise”
(ie, chance) compared with higher-volume regions. To ac-
countforthesedifferencesinvolumeperregion(ie,thestrength
of the statistical signal), empirical Bayes estimates were ap-
pliedto“shrink”lower-volumeregionstowardtheoverallpopu-
lationmeanusingthemethodspreviouslydescribed.21-24Thus,
thefinalrateofreoperationforeachhospitalreferralregionused
in this study was both risk- and reliability-adjusted, resulting
in a conservative estimate of variation. Reliability adjustments
were not used in the rest of our analysis beyond this specific
national estimate of variation across referral regions.
The final aim of this analysis was to assess Medicare pay-
ments, which was done in 2 forms. First, the unadjusted pay-
ments were used to determine the bottom line to Medicare (ie,
what was actually paid to providers for episodes of care). Next,
the payments were assessed after a price standardization. This
additional comparison was performed because payments from
Medicare are partially based on geography (to account for the
local cost of living and wage index) as well as the settings in
whichthecareisprovided(eg,ifprovidersparticipateingradu-
ate medical education or care for a disproportionate share of
low-income patients.) By accounting for these intended pay-
ment adjustments, the price-standardized amounts provide
more insight into the differences in resources associated with
gastric band procedures. The methods described initially by
the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and subse-
quently by the Dartmouth Institute25-27 were used to perform
price standardization. This same approach has also been ap-
plied in previous reports using Medicare Provider Analysis and
Reviewdatatoexaminepaymentsforsurgicalprocedures.28-30
All reported P values were 2-sided and a value of less than
.05 was used as threshold for significance. All statistical analy-
ses were completed with Stata, version 14 (Stata Corp).
Results
A total of 25 042 patients undergoing a laparoscopic gastric
band placement were included in this study (Table 1). Pa-
tients who did not undergo a reoperation, on average, were
more likely to be men (28.4% vs 23.8%; P < .001) and white
(82.9% vs 81.2%; P = .007). Patients requiring reoperation had
lower rates of hypertension (64.9% vs 73.4%; P < .001) and
diabetes (40.4% vs 44.6%; P < .001).
Patients in this study underwent their index gastric band
operations at 732 different hospitals. Compared with patients
who underwent a reoperation, patients who did not undergo a
reoperation were more likely to have their index operation at a
nonprofit center (68.6% vs 56.7%; P < .01) or at a teaching hos-
pital (61.7% vs 54.4%; P < .01). Most reoperations were per-
formed during an elective admission (reoperation admission
type: elective, 79.9%; urgent, 10.0%; and emergency, 10.1%).
Alargeproportionofpatientswhohadagastricbandplaced
underwent a reoperation. With an average of a 4.5-year follow
up, 4636 patients (18.5%) underwent 17 539 reoperations (an
average of 3.8 procedures per patient in addition to their in-
dex operation). The frequency distribution of reoperations
was right-skewed with a median of 2.5 reoperations. The most
common reoperation was band removal, followed by band re-
placement (Table 2). Of the patients who had a reoperation,
19.1% underwent a subsequent different bariatric operation,
including gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy.
Geographic variation was observed in the rates of gastric
band–related reoperation. The rates of reoperation across hos-
pitalreferralregionsrangedfrom5.1%to95.5%.Thebottomquar-
tileofhospitalreferralregionshadamean(SD)reoperationrate
of 13.3% (0.03) while the top quartile had a mean (SD) reopera-
tion rate of 39.1% (0.21), reflecting a 2.9-fold variation. Hospital
referral regions divided into quartiles by rates of risk- and
reliability-adjusted rates of reoperation are shown in Figure 1.
During the study period, Medicare paid $470 million for
laparoscopicgastricband–associatedprocedures,ofwhich$224
million(47.6%)ofthepaymentswereforreoperations.In2006,
reoperation procedures accounted for 16.4% of the total
Medicare spending related to the gastric band device, which
increased to 77.3% by 2013 (Figure 2).
Price-standardized Medicare payments were assessed for
the index operation to place the gastric band and then for any
subsequent reoperations. The mean payment was $12 345 for
the index operation and $19 657 for each reoperation. Com-
pared with the episode payment to place the gastric band, pay-
ments for reoperations were more expensive across each mea-

Discussion
This study has 3 important findings that improve our under-
standing of the laparoscopic gastric band used to treat patients
withmorbidobesity.First,areoperationaftergastricbandplace-
ment is common, with nearly 1 in 5 patients requiring at least 1
additionalgastricband–relatedsurgicalprocedurewithiname-
dian follow-up of 4.5 years. Second, there is wide geographic
variation (2.9-fold) in the rates of reoperation across hospital
referral regions after accounting for patient characteristics and
secular trends. Third, although a substantial number of gastric
bands are still being placed, as of 2013, more than 77% of pay-
ments related to the device were for reoperations, reflecting
either complications related to the gastric band placement or
weight loss failure. Taken together, these findings indicate that
the gastric band is associated with high reoperation rates and
considerable costs to payers, which raises concerns about its
safety, effectiveness, and value.

informed the FDA approval of the device reported reoperation
rates as low as 4% with a 1- to 2-year follow-up.1,4 Subsequent
similarly sized trials with longer follow-ups began reporting
reoperationratesashighas60%.7 Thelargest,long-termpopu-
lation-level estimates of the gastric band come from France,
where a 7-year follow-up in a closed health care system de-
tectedareoperationrateof20%.31Toourknowledge,thisstudy
provides the first longitudinal, national population-based
estimate in the United States and confirms the high reopera-
tion rates seen elsewhere. Moreover, the finding of a 2.9-fold
geographic variation may partially help explain the wide range
of rates individually reported in previous smaller studies.
Whether the gastric band has been effective in facilitating
weightlosshasalsobeendebated.Ameta-analysisof48studies

2003and2012comparedthegastricbandwitheitheraRoux-en-Y
gastric bypass or a sleeve gastrectomy.32 At 1-, 3-, and 5-year
follow-up, the gastric band was the least effective in facilitating
weightlosscomparedwiththeotherbariatricprocedures.While
this study did not specifically study weight loss as an outcome,
the findings here do support concerns about the gastric band
effectiveness,asnearly1in5patientswhounderwentareopera-
tion subsequently underwent a different bariatric procedure.
Although the present study cannot identify a mechanism
to explain the wide variation in the rates of reoperation that
were observed, the data suggest at least 2 possibilities. First,
the cohort who underwent a reoperation had a higher rate of
having received a psychiatric diagnosis at the time of their in-
dex operation. This finding is consistent with other previous
reports that identified preoperative psychiatric illness as a risk
factor for worse postoperative outcomes.33-36 Second, most of
the reoperations were done in the elective setting. This sug-
gests that the variable patient and clinician preferences about
the gastric band may be important underlying drivers leading
to a reoperation, rather than simply emergency scenarios in
which a reoperation was required.
Strengths and Limitations

tations.First,usingadministrativeclaimsdatamaynothavecap-

threatenthegeneralizabilityofthestudytopopulationsthatare
youngerandnotreceivingMedicarebenefitswhofrequentlyun-
dergobariatricprocedures.Manypatientsincludedinthisanaly-
sisqualifiedforMedicarethroughdisabilitiesbeforeage65years,
which made our overall average age of the cohort closer to the
general population. Furthermore, the reoperation rates in this
study are within the range reported in smaller studies that
included younger patients.
This study has several important practice and policy im-
plications related to bariatric surgery. First, for patients con-
sidering bariatric surgery, these data help inform them about
the long-term risks associated with placing the gastric band.
These include the facts that not only is reoperation common,
but also that those who underwent reoperation often under-
wentseveraladditionalprocedures.Thissharplycontrastswith
the lower reoperation rates of 3% to 9% that have been re-
portedforotherbariatricprocedures.32Second,forpayersseek-
ing out cost-containment strategies, this identifies an impor-
tant opportunity to reduce the costs of bariatric procedures.
Because approximately half of payments related to the gastric
band went toward reoperations, payers may now have
financial incentive to guide patients toward other bariatric op-
erations as their first-line surgical treatment. Third, the find-
ings of wide variation after controlling patient factors sug-
gests that clinicians may have variable abilities to effectively
place and manage the device. Those who continue to use the
device may benefit from peer training to improve their opera-
tive technique or to develop a more judicious patient selec-
tion. Finally, policymakers and regulatory agencies approv-
ing future devices for bariatric patients may need a more
longitudinal role beyond initial trials and the voluntary report-
ing of complications. Given our current ability to manage large
data sets, the FDA may now have a feasible approach to pro-
spectively track devices in claims data to ensure outcomes af-
ter broadly adopting a new technology mirror to those re-
portedinearlyrandomizedclinicaltrialstoapprovethedevice.
Conclusions
Among Medicare beneficiaries undergoing laparoscopic
adjustable gastric band surgery, reoperation was common,
costly,andvariedwidelyacrosshospitalreferralregions.These
findings suggest that payers should reconsider their coverage
of the gastric band device.
