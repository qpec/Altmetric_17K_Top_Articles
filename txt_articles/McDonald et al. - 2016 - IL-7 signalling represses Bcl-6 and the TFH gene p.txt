The transcriptional repressor Bcl-6 is linked to the development of both CD4 þ T follicular
helper (TFH) and central memory T (TCM) cells. Here, we demonstrate that in response to
decreased IL-2 signalling, T helper 1 (TH1) cells upregulate Bcl-6 and co-initiate TFH- and
TCM-like gene programs, including expression of the cytokine receptors IL-6Ra and IL-7R.
Exposure of this potentially bi-potent cell population to IL-6 favours the TFH gene program,
whereas IL-7 signalling represses TFH-associated genes including Bcl6 and Cxcr5, but not
the TCM-related genes Klf2 and Sell. Mechanistically, IL-7-dependent activation of STAT5
contributes to Bcl-6 repression. Importantly, antigen-specific IL-6Ra þIL-7R þ CD4 þ T cells
emerge from the effector population at late time points post influenza infection. These data
support a novel role for IL-7 in the repression of the TFH gene program and evoke a
divergent regulatory mechanism by which post-effector TH1 cells may contribute to long-term
cell-mediated and humoral immunity.

uring the course of an immune response, CD4 þ T helper
cells identify invading pathogens, proliferate and secrete
cytokines to aid in immune-mediated clearance of
infection. This results in an initial expansion of effector CD4 þ
T cells. As pathogen is eliminated, the number of CD4 þ T cells is
reduced to avoid potential autoimmunity that may result from a
prolonged effector T-cell response. During this contraction phase,
long-lived CD4 þ T cells—termed memory T cells—survive to
respond
more
quickly
and
robustly
should
the
immune
system re-encounter the same pathogen. The development of
comprehensive immunological memory requires the generation
of cells that are capable of contributing to both long-term
cell-mediated and humoral immune responses, and includes
populations of both CD4 þ
central memory T (TCM) and
T-follicular helper (TFH) cells.
TCM cells are one of many CD4 þ memory T-cell populations
that also include effector memory (TEM), resident memory (TRM)
and recirculating memory (TRCM) cell types1–3. These diverse sets
of memory cells have been primarily identified by their immune
function, tissue location and cell surface receptor expression.
Specifically, TCM cells are uniquely identified by the expression of
the homing receptors L-selectin (CD62L, encoded by the gene
Sell) and Ccr7 (ref. 1). The expression of these two receptors
allows for trafficking to the T-cell zones of secondary lymphoid
areas where TCM cells can participate in cell-mediated immunity
by engaging in antigen surveillance.
TFH cells facilitate humoral immune responses by assisting
B-lymphocytes with the production of pathogen-neutralizing
antibodies4–6. TFH cells are defined in part by the expression
of the cell surface receptor Cxcr5, which allows for homing to the
B cell zones of secondary lymphoid organs4,5. Differentiation of
the TFH cell subset is a complex and multi-step process. These
steps include the initiation of the TFH gene program, denoted by
an initial upregulation of a partial TFH-profile (that is, Bcl-6 and
Cxcr5 expression), followed by a second stage, whereby full
commitment to the germinal center TFH cell state occurs upon
B-cell interaction and enhanced ICOS signalling7. Given the
inherent complexity of this process, many questions remain
regarding the genesis of TFH cell populations. For example, while
TFH cells can and do develop during the initial response to
antigen, it has also been demonstrated that other effector
T-helper cell subsets are capable of adopting a TFH-like
profile,
making
a
‘post-effector’
developmental
pathway
plausible as well8–13. These previous studies are important
as they support the possibility that, in addition to effector TFH
cells, other T-helper populations may assist in long-term
antibody-mediated immunity by co-opting certain aspects of
the TFH-cell gene program.
It has been previously demonstrated that the transcriptional
repressor Bcl-6 is required for TFH development14–16. Bcl-6
directs TFH differentiation, at least in part, by antagonizing the
expression of a second transcriptional repressor, Blimp-1, a
known negative regulator of TFH cell differentiation12,14–16.
Interestingly, upregulation of Bcl-6 has also been implicated
in the differentiation of CD4 þ effector T cells into memory cells,
including the TCM subset17–20. However, it is currently unclear
how this increase in Bcl-6 expression initiates this effector-to-
memory transition. As with TFH differentiation, it has been
postulated that a key function of Bcl-6 in promoting memory cell
formation is to repress the expression of Blimp-1, a factor
positively linked to the terminal differentiation of the effector cell
state2,21–23. However, whether there are additional roles or
long-term requirements for Bcl-6 expression in establishing
TCM-cell fate apart from Blimp-1 repression remains unclear.
Although transcription factors such as Bcl-6 are responsible for
regulating the gene expression profiles of developing cells,
upstream
environmental
signals,
often
in
the
form
of
a
cytokine-dependent response, regulate the expression and/or the
functional activity of individual transcription factors24. For
example, it has been demonstrated that strong interleukin-2
(IL-2) signalling inhibits TFH formation by controlling the
expression of Bcl-6 and Blimp-1 (refs 12,25–27). Similarly, it
has been shown that inflammatory cytokine environments,
including those that are IL-2 rich, can inhibit memory cell
formation28,29.
Collectively, evidence in the literature suggests that, despite
their distinct functions and localization during the adaptive
immune response, TFH and TCM cells share specific regulatory
requirements and developmental programs. In addition, several
recent studies have reported a high degree of similarity between
TFH and TCM cells at the transcriptional and protein expression
levels9,17,19,30. Furthermore, populations of memory TFH and
TCM cells similarly express a number of cell surface receptors
including Cxcr5, CD62L and Ccr7 (refs 8,9,30–32). Thus, there
are precedents supporting the possibility that these two immune
cell populations may be developmentally linked. However, as the
contribution of each of these cells to long-term immunity is
functionally distinct, it is likely that at some point there is a
divergence to unique cytokine and transcriptional networks to
allow
for
specialized
TFH-
and
TCM-dependent
immune
responses.
Here, we demonstrate that T-helper 1 (TH1) cells are capable of
co-initiating the expression of both TFH and TCM gene programs
in response to decreased IL-2 signalling. Mechanistically, the
initial co-expression of the TFH and TCM programs is due to
the Bcl-6-dependent repression of Blimp-1. In addition, during
this
post-effector
stage,
TH1
cells
downregulate
IL-2Ra
expression, while upregulating the dual expression of IL-6Ra
and IL-7R. This apparent cytokine receptor reprogramming
results in a population of bi-potent ‘TFH/TCM-like’ cells with the
ability to respond to either IL-6 or IL-7. Strikingly, while
treatment with IL-6 results in the upregulation of Bcl-6 and
Cxcr5 expression, exposure of these cells to IL-7 results in a
dose-dependent decrease in TFH-associated genes including Bcl-6,
while allowing the continued expression of TCM-specific genes.
Importantly, at late time points post influenza infection, a
population of antigen-specific IL-6Ra þIL-7R þ CD4 þ T cells
emerges coincident with a decline in the effector population.
Thus, this study describes a novel role for IL-7 in the repression
of the TFH gene program and defines a potential mechanism by
which post-effector TH1 cells may be able to support aspects of
both long-term cell-mediated and humoral immunity.
Results
IL-2 signalling modulates TH1, TFH and TCM gene expression.
Our previous studies demonstrated that reduced IL-2 signalling
has the potential to regulate T-helper cell fate decisions by
augmenting the expression of the TFH lineage-defining factor
Bcl-6 (ref. 12). In addition to its required role in TFH cell
development, Bcl-6 expression has also been implicated in the
formation of memory CD4 þ
T cells1,17,19,20. As such, we
examined
whether
the
IL-2-sensitive
increase
in
Bcl-6
expression would similarly result in the upregulation of a
memory cell gene program by exposing in vitro generated TH1
cells to both high and low IL-2 concentrations. As with our prior
study, the expression of a number of TH1 genes was decreased in
low environmental IL-2 conditions, while the expression of key
TFH genes was induced, including the expression of Bcl6 and
Cxcr5 (Fig. 1a,b). Consistent with the increase in transcript, Bcl-6
protein and cell surface expression of Cxcr5 were significantly
increased (Fig. 1c,d). Interestingly, in addition to the induction of

 the TFH-like profile, TH1 cells exposed to a low IL-2 concentration
also upregulated genes associated with the TCM cell type—most
notably the lymph node homing receptors Sell and Ccr7
(Fig. 1e)1,2,33. We also observed increased expression of other
memory T-cell-related markers (Il7r, S1pr1, Cd27 and Cxcr3) and
transcription factors known to promote the memory T-cell fate
(Klf2, Klf3 and Foxo1; Fig. 1e,f). Interestingly, the expression of
Tcf7, the gene that encodes the transcriptional regulator TCF-1,
was significantly increased (Fig. 1f). Similar to Bcl-6, the
expression of TCF-1 has been implicated in the development
of both TFH and memory cells34–38. Importantly, the induction of
the TCM-like profile was not limited to changes in transcript
alone, as the cell surface expression of both CD62L and Ccr7 was
significantly increased compared with that observed in effector
TH1 cells (Fig. 1g,h). Collectively, these data demonstrate that
increased Bcl-6 expression in TH1 cells, in response to decreased

 IL-2 signalling, results in the induction of not only a TFH-like
profile, but a TCM-like profile as well. Furthermore, these data
suggest that a common Bcl-6-dependent regulatory mechanism
may be responsible for the initiation of both the TFH and TCM
gene programs.
Blimp-1 inhibits the TCM-associated genes Sell and Ccr7. We
previously identified Blimp-1 as a factor responsible for directly
repressing members of the TFH gene program including Cxcr5
and Il6ra12. A key finding from our prior studies was that in
response to reduced IL-2 signalling, Bcl-6 expression increased in
TH1 cells, resulting in the Bcl-6-dependent repression of Blimp-1
and the subsequent induction of the TFH gene program
(Fig. 1c)12,39. Given our finding that increased Bcl-6 expression
also leads to the induction of a TCM-like profile, we hypothesized
that the same mechanistic interplay between Bcl-6 and Blimp-1
that results in the promotion of the TFH program may also initiate
the transition from an effector TH1 to a TCM-like cell state.
Therefore, we examined whether TCM genes, similar to TFH genes,
were direct Blimp-1 targets in effector TH1 cells. Using predictive
transcription factor binding site software (Genomatix), we
identified potentially functional Blimp-1 DNA-binding elements
in the promoters of both Sell and Ccr7. To determine whether
the
predicted
elements
were
functional,
we
prepared
promoter–reporter constructs encompassing the predicted sites
and performed luciferase reporter experiments in the presence
and
absence
of
overexpressed
Blimp-1.
Importantly,
the
expression of Blimp-1 resulted in a decrease in the promoter
activity of both Sell and Ccr7 (Fig. 2a,b). As a control, there was
no Blimp-1-mediated repression of a Tbx21-reporter, which lacks
predicted Blimp-1 DNA-binding elements. To determine whether
Blimp-1-mediated repression may be the result of direct DNA
binding, we performed promoter–reporter experiments with a
mutant Blimp-1 construct lacking the zinc finger DNA-binding
domain (DZF). Although wild-type Blimp-1 readily repressed
promoter activity, there was no repression with the Blimp-1DZF
protein (Fig. 2c,d). As a further test of the functional nature of the
predicted sites, a Sell-reporter construct lacking the Blimp-1
DNA-binding element (pGL3-SellDBL1) was not repressed by
Blimp-1 (Fig. 2e,f).
To examine the extent of Blimp-1-specific repression in an
endogenous setting, we utilized a knockdown approach to assess
the effect of decreasing Blimp-1 levels on the expression of these
genes in effector TH1 cells (Fig. 2g). Upon small interfering RNA
(siRNA) knockdown of Blimp-1 expression, we observed a
modest but significant increase in both Sell and Ccr7 expression
(Fig. 2h). Collectively, these data suggest that the TCM-associated
genes Sell and Ccr7 are repressed by Blimp-1 in effector TH1 cells.
Furthermore, these findings suggest that the repression of
Blimp-1 by Bcl-6 is a critical event for the initiation of both
TFH and TCM gene programs in TH1 cells.
TH1 cells undergo cytokine receptor reprogramming. TCM and
TFH
cell
differentiation
represent
complex-
and
multistep
processes that are directed by a litany of factors. A key
determinant that influences immune cell differentiation is the
cytokine environment to which the cell is exposed, as well as the
ability of that cell to sense and respond to its environment
through cytokine receptor expression. Our data indicate that
effector TH1 cells upregulate both TCM- and TFH-like gene
expression patterns in response to a low IL-2 environment.
Importantly, IL-2-signalling is known to influence the expression
of cytokine receptors40. Initially, Il2ra is expressed at high levels
in the effector TH1 cells. However, as these cells transition to a
low IL-2 environment, our data demonstrate that Il2ra expression
decreases, whereas the expression of Il6ra and Il7r increases
(Fig.
1a,b,e).
Hence,
the
predominant
cytokine
receptor
expression pattern changes from one supportive of effector TH1
cells, which are responsive to elevated IL-2, to one enriched
with IL-6Ra and IL-7R—receptors that respond to cytokines
favouring
TFH
and
TCM
development,
respectively41–46.
Furthermore,
these
data
are
suggestive
of
the
intriguing
possibility that three divergent cell types may emerge from
the
effector
TH1
population:
a
pre-TFH-like
population
(IL-6Ra þIL-7R �),
a
pre-TCM-like
population
(IL-6Ra �
IL-7R þ) and/or a bi-potent pre-TFH/TCM (IL-6Ra þIL-7R þ)
population that may be capable of transitioning into either
cell type.
To address the above possibilities, we assessed the composition
of both the high IL-2 and low IL-2- treated TH1 populations by
examining the cell surface expression of IL-6Ra and IL-7R.
Consistent with our transcript analysis, the expression of both
IL-6Ra and IL-7R was significantly upregulated, whereas IL-2Ra
was downregulated, on the surface of the low IL-2-treated cells
(Fig. 3a–c). Importantly, the majority of the low IL-2-treated cells
displayed dual expression of these receptors (double positive ‘DP’,
IL-6Ra þIL-7R þ), whereas comparably few of the DP cells were
observed in the high IL-2-treated (TH1) population (Fig. 3d,e).
To confirm that the IL-6Ra þIL-7R þ cells expressed both
TFH-like and TCM-like programs, we sorted the DP population
and compared the expression of key TH1, TFH and TCM genes to
that observed in effector high IL-2-treated (TH1) and bulk low
IL-2-treated (TFH-like) cells. Indeed, while significant differences
were observed between the IL-6Ra þIL-7R þ DP and effector TH1
cells, the gene expression programs between sorted DP and bulk
TFH-like cells were relatively indistinguishable (Fig. 4). Consistent
with the transcript analysis, IL-6Ra þIL-7R þ cells also displayed
elevated cell surface expression of CD62L, Ccr7 and Cxcr5
(Supplementary Fig. 1a–c). Collectively, these data support a
model whereby, in response to reduced IL-2 signalling, TH1 cells
co-initiate the expression of both TFH and TCM-like gene
programs, including the dual expression of IL-6Ra and IL-7R
(hereafter referred to as ‘TFH/TCM-like’ cells).
IL-6 and IL-7 differentially regulate TFH and TCM genes. The
cytokines IL-6 and IL-7 have demonstrated roles in establishing
and sustaining the TFH and TCM cell fates, respectively41–46.
Therefore, to test the functional nature of IL-6Ra and IL-7R
co-expression, we treated the TFH/TCM-like cells with either IL-6
or
IL-7
and
examined
the
expression
of
key
TFH-
and
TCM-associated genes as compared with untreated controls. IL-6
treatment resulted in increased expression of the hallmark TFH
genes Bcl6 and Cxcr5, but did not significantly impact the
expression of the TCM gene Sell (Supplementary Fig. 2a,b).
Conversely, exposure to IL-7 resulted in a significant reduction in
Bcl-6 expression and the repression of several other TFH genes
(Cxcr5, Il6ra, Sh2d1a and Cd40lg) (Fig. 5a,b). In many cases, the
repression of the TFH-associated genes resulted in expression
levels near to those observed in effector TH1 cells.
As IL-7 is present at low levels in secondary lymphoid tissues,
we
next
exposed
the
TFH/TCM-like
cells
to
a
range
of
physiologically relevant IL-7 concentrations and analysed the
expression of key TCM and TFH genes (Supplementary Fig. 3)46.
Strikingly,
even
at
an
extremely
low
concentration
of
environmental IL-7, hallmark TFH genes (Bcl6, Cxcr5 and Il6ra)
were preferentially repressed. In stark contrast, the expression of
the TCM-associated genes Sell, Klf2 and Ccr7 was relatively
unaffected by IL-7 treatment. Importantly, the expression of the
anti-apoptotic gene, Bcl2, and the gene encoding the glycerol
channel aquaporin 9, Aqp9, both of which are known to promote

 the long-term survival of memory cells, was induced in response
to IL-7 (Supplementary Fig. 3)47,48.
To further examine IL-7-induced changes to TFH and TCM cell
surface marker expression, we compared Cxcr5 and CD62L
protein expression in untreated TFH/TCM-like cells to those
exposed to IL-7. Consistent with our transcript data, IL-7
treatment resulted in a significant reduction in Cxcr5 cell surface
expression (Fig. 5c). In contrast, exposure to IL-7 resulted in a
modest increase in CD62L, again suggesting that the repressive
effect of IL-7 is limited to the TFH profile (Fig. 5d). It is important
to note that in spite of the observed decrease in Cxcr5 expression, a
majority of the Cxcr5 expressed on the cell surface remained
refractory to the IL-7 repressive effect. This was in contrast to the
almost complete loss of Bcl-6 protein expression in response to
IL-7 treatment. These data corroborate other studies demonstrat-
ing that Cxcr5 expression can occur independent of Bcl-6
expression13,49. Furthermore, these data are consistent with the
moderate expression of Cxcr5 observed on TCM cells1,19,50.

 IL-7-induced repression of Bcl-6 is independent of Blimp-1.
The finding that IL-7 represses Bcl-6 expression has potentially
far-reaching implications given the demonstrated roles for Bcl-6
in TFH development, TCM differentiation and in the regulation of
cellular
functions
including
metabolism
and

progression14–16,20,39,51,52. As such, we sought to determine the
identity of the transcription factor(s) responsible for directing
IL-7-mediated repression of Bcl-6. There is a well-established
inverse relationship between the transcriptional repressors Bcl-6
and Blimp-1 (refs 12,14,17,53). As our data demonstrate that
IL-7-signalling inhibits Bcl-6 expression, we considered the
possibility that IL-7 treatment may lead to increased Blimp-1
expression. To test this possibility, we examined the level of
Prdm1 (Blimp-1) expression in TH1 cells compared with that of
TFH/TCM-like cells, and TFH/TCM-like cells exposed to IL-7
(Fig. 6a). Consistent with our previous results, TH1 cells displayed
significantly elevated expression of Prdm1 transcript as compared
with
TFH/TCM-like
cells12.
Interestingly,
despite
increased
activation of STAT5 (which has been positively linked to
Blimp-1
expression
in
response
to
IL-2
signalling),
no
appreciable increase in Blimp-1 protein was observed in the
TFH/TCM-like cells stimulated with IL-7 (Fig. 6b). These data
indicate that Blimp-1 is unlikely to be the IL-7-responsive factor
that represses Bcl-6 expression. Furthermore, these data suggest
that the IL-7-treated TFH/TCM-like cells are not simply reverting
to a short-lived effector TH1 phenotype (that is, possessing high
Blimp-1 expression). Rather, it appears they are transitioning into
cells with a gene program that more closely resembles that of
long-lived TCM cells.
IL-7 regulates STAT5 association with the Bcl6 promoter. It is
well established that the transcription factor STAT5 is activated
downstream
of
IL-7
signalling46,54,55.
Although
STAT5
is
known to function as a transcriptional activator, recent studies
have described novel roles for STAT5 in the direct repression of
gene expression12,56. To determine whether IL-7-signalling
represses Bcl-6 expression through the activation of STAT5,
we compared the activation state of STAT5 (p-STAT5) in
effector TH1, TFH/TCM-like cells and TFH/TCM-like cells exposed
to IL-7 (Fig. 6c). Cells treated with IL-7 displayed elevated levels
of STAT5 phosphorylation similar to that observed in effector
TH1 cells. In contrast, TFH/TCM-like cells had relatively low
STAT5 activation. Importantly, the increased level of STAT5
activation in IL-7-treated cells correlated with decreased Bcl-6
expression.

 Given the inverse relationship between activated STAT5 and
Bcl-6 expression, we hypothesized that STAT5 could play a role
in the IL-7-mediated repression of Bcl-6 by directly binding to
and repressing the Bcl6 promoter. In support of this hypothesis, a
recent report demonstrated that a DNA sequence-specific
tetrameric
STAT5
complex
functions
downstream
of
IL-7R-signalling
to
repress
gene
expression
during
B-cell
differentiation56. We analysed the Bcl6 locus and identified
a
potential
tetrameric
STAT5
DNA-binding
site
in
the
promoter region (Fig. 6d). We then performed chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses to determine whether
STAT5 associates with the Bcl6 promoter in response to IL-7.
Indeed, we detected increased STAT5 binding at the Bcl6 locus in
TFH/TCM-like cells exposed to IL-7 as compared with untreated
TFH/TCM-like cells (Fig. 6e). Importantly, the highest levels of
STAT5 association corresponded to the location of the predicted
tetrameric STAT5 binding site (Fig. 6d,e). Collectively, these data
support a role for IL-7-activated STAT5 in the direct repression
of Bcl-6 expression.
IL-6Ra þIL-7R þ CD4 þ T cells emerge post influenza infection.
A key discovery from our in vitro experiments was that effector
TH1 cells upregulate both TFH and TCM gene programs in response
to withdrawal of IL-2. These conditions are consistent with the late
stages of an immune response, as the pro-inflammatory cytokine
environment wanes and the effector population transitions to a
memory population capable of supporting both cell-mediated and
humoral immunity. Intriguingly, we observed that effector TH1
cells undergo a period of cytokine receptor reprogramming in
which they downregulate IL-2Ra, upregulate IL-6Ra and IL-7R,
and initiate the expression of hallmark TFH and TCM genes.
Therefore, to assess the kinetics of IL-6Ra and IL-7R expression
in vivo, we infected mice with influenza (A/PR8/34; ‘PR8’) and
monitored antigen-specific (nucleoprotein, ‘NP’-specific) CD4 þ
T cells at multiple time points post infection (days post infection,
d.p.i.). Shortly after infection (9 d.p.i.), cells could be divided into
roughly two populations: effector TFH (Bcl-6HICxcr5HI) and
effector non-TFH (Bcl-6MIDCxcr5MID). At this time point, the
majority of the non-TFH effector population expressed low levels of
IL-7R. However, at later time points (30 and 60 d.p.i.), a substantial
percentage of this population displayed increased expression of
IL-7R (Fig. 7a). In comparison, TFH cells expressed relatively low
levels of IL-7R, especially at late time points post infection
(Supplementary Fig. 4). Strikingly, the same cells that displayed
increased expression of IL-7R also expressed the highest levels of
IL-6Ra (Fig. 7b). Importantly, the IL-6Ra þIL-7R þ DP popula-
tion increased with time post infection, whereas effector TFH and
non-TFH (IL-7RLO) populations decreased (Fig. 7c). Collectively,
these data indicate that a population of long-lived (60 d.p.i.),
antigen-specific
IL6Ra þIL7Rþ
DP
cells
arises
during
the
post-influenza-infection period. Furthermore, the dual expression
of
IL-6Ra
and
IL-7R,
in
addition
to
our
in
vitro
data
demonstrating the differential regulation of TFH and TCM gene
programs by IL-6 and IL-7, suggest that the activation of these
cytokine-signalling pathways will likely influence the functional
capabilities of the IL-6Ra þIL-7R þ cells in vivo.
Discussion
Following infection, the contraction of the effector response and
the subsequent emergence of the memory cell population are vital
to long-lasting immunity. However, the potential for memory
populations to arise from the numerous CD4 þ T-cell subsets, as
well as the degree of plasticity that exists between these subsets,
has complicated the identification of specific environmental
signals and precise transcriptional networks that direct the
effector-to-memory transition. For example, TFH and TCM cells

 appear to share developmental pathways, including requirements
for the transcriptional repressor Bcl-6 and low levels of IL-2
signalling14–16,19,20. Interestingly, our data suggest that the
TFH and TCM gene programs can co-initiate from a population
of effector TH1 cells upon increased Bcl-6 expression in
response to IL-2 withdrawal, resulting in a ‘TFH/TCM-like’
population. In agreement with these data, there is emerging
evidence for a set of genes which are linked to both TFH and
memory cell development, including Bcl6, Cxcr5, Il7r and Tcf7
(refs 9,19,34–38). In addition, these data are physiologically
intuitive as IL-2 signalling decreases during the late stages of an
immune response, coincident with the formation of memory cell
populations. Indeed, both TFH and TCM cells are required post
contraction to mediate long-lasting humoral- and cell-mediated
immunity, respectively. Therefore, it is likely that, following
the initial co-expression of the TFH and TCM gene programs,
there are distinct environmental and transcriptional regulatory
mechanisms
that
promote
TFH
versus
TCM-cell-dependent
immune responses.
In support of this divergence, we observed that TH1 cells
downregulate IL-2Ra while upregulating both IL-6Ra and IL-7R
in response to a reduction in IL-2 signalling. Thus, these cells
appear to reprogramme their ability to respond to both a
TCM-essential (IL-7) and a TFH-associated (IL-6) cytokine. Our
data further demonstrate that IL-6 treatment of TFH/TCM-like
cells results in the further augmentation of the TFH profile.
However,
IL-7
exposure
results
in
an
inhibition
of
TFH
genes, including Bcl-6. These findings highlight a previously
unappreciated role for IL-7 in the repression of the TFH gene
program in post-effector TH1 cells. Importantly, they also suggest
that Bcl-6 may only be required for the initiation of the TCM gene
program, and that further developmental steps require a unique
and undefined set of transcriptional regulators. Indeed, there
are many reports in the literature describing a reduction in
Bcl-6
expression
in
TCM
cells
at
late
time
points
post
infection7,13,19,30,57. Furthermore, these findings are consistent
with defined roles for Bcl-6 in the regulation of metabolism,

 IL-7-dependent repression of Bcl-6 may ultimately be necessary
to promote the unique sets of regulatory activities required for
long-term memory cell survival.
Interestingly, while IL-6 treatment augmented TFH gene
expression, it did not affect the expression of TCM genes in the
TFH/TCM-like post-effector population. Thus, these cells express
hallmark genes of both TFH and TCM-cell types and resemble
TFH-memory cells50. Whether there is a factor akin to IL-7
responsible for repressing the TCM-profile and promoting the TFH
cell fate is a question that remains to be answered. In support of
the model proposed here and perhaps shedding light on this
question, recent reports have highlighted the antagonistic nature
of TFH-associated ICOS signalling and the TCM transcription
factor,
Klf2.
In
these
studies,
ICOS
signalling-dependent
repression of Klf2 was required for commitment to the TFH-cell
fate60,61. Thus, in addition to IL-6 signalling, interactions between
TFH/TCM-like cells and B cells, along with the corresponding
ICOS stimulation, are likely required to antagonize the TCM gene
program
and
specifically
promote
TFH-dependent
immune
responses.
Our data demonstrate that the IL-7-dependent repression of
Bcl-6 is not a result of increased Blimp-1 expression. This is
surprising, as these transcriptional repressors often appear in
opposition during developmental steps in the immune system.
Rather, our current data support a mechanism of transcriptional
repression whereby activated STAT5 functions downstream of
IL-7 signalling to repress Bcl-6 expression. This finding is similar
to the inverse correlation between IL-2-dependent STAT5
activation and Bcl-6 expression that we reported in a prior
study12. Interestingly, STAT5 has been shown to interact with the
histone methyltransferase, Ezh2, downstream of IL-7 signalling56.
As such, future experiments that determine whether there are
cytokine-dependent differences to the composition of the STAT5
complex that binds to the Bcl6 locus could provide insight into
how IL-7 and IL-2 harbour non-redundant roles in the regulation
of immune cell development and function, despite signalling
through a common downstream transcriptional regulator, STAT5
(refs 54,55).
Collectively, this study supports a model in which effector TH1
cells co-initiate TFH and TCM gene programs when IL-2 signals
begin to wane. Our finding that antigen-specific effector CD4 þ
T cells upregulate the dual expression of IL-6Ra and IL-7R at
late time points post influenza infection suggests that exposure
to either cytokine could be a key determinant in further
differentiation events and long-term cellular function. Although
these findings may be indicative of divergence to either a TFH- or

 TCM-specific gene program, they do not preclude the possibility
that plasticity exists between these cell states to influence
trafficking between the T-cell and B-cell zones of secondary
lymphoid tissues to provide a more comprehensive immune
response. It is also possible that the simultaneous expression
of
IL-6Ra
and
IL-7R
allow
for
precise
modulation
of
Bcl-6 expression. A rheostatic model such as this may allow for
modest Bcl-6 expression, sufficient to repress Blimp-1 expression
and
initiate
the
TCM
transcriptional
program,
while
also
repressing the enhanced levels of Bcl-6 required for TFH
development via IL-7 signalling. Future studies that address
these possibilities by examining the functional properties of the
IL-6Ra þIL-7R þ CD4 þ cells described here will be critical to
enhance our understanding of the relationship between the TFH
and TCM cell types.
Methods
Primary cells and cell culture. Primary naive CD4 þ T cells were isolated from
the spleen and lymph nodes of sex- and age-matched (5–8-week old) wild-type
C57BL/6 mice using the MagCellect kit (R&D, MAGM205), consistently providing
a 90–95% pure population. Following isolation, cells were cultured on plate-bound
aCD3/aCD28 in TH1 polarizing conditions (a-IL-4 (5 mg ml � 1) and IL-12
(5 ng ml � 1)). After 3 days, cells were removed from aCD3/aCD28 stimulation,
split and cultured for an additional 2 days in either high (250 U ml � 1) or low IL-2
(10 U ml � 1) conditions to generate effector TH1 or TFH-like cells, respectively12.
Low IL-2-treated cells were then treated with IL-6 (10 ng ml � 1) or IL-7
(10 ng ml � 1) unless otherwise indicated. Following a 24-h incubation, cells were
collected for analysis. Primary T-cell transfections were performed with the 4D
Lonza nucleofection system (program DN-100, solution P3). The Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committees of Virginia Tech and the University of Alabama
at Birmingham approved all the experimentation involving the use of mice. All the
methods were performed in accordance with the approved guidelines.
Murine EL4 T cells (TIB-39, ATCC) were cultured in RPMI supplemented with
10% FBS and 1% Pen-strep. EL4 transfections were performed using the Lonza 4D
nucleofection system (program CM-120, solution SF). Immunoblot analysis was
used to assess the expression levels of all transfected proteins.
RNA purification and quantitative PCR with reverse transcription. Cells were
collected on day 5, 6 or 7 (dependent on experimental design) and RNA was
purified using the Machery Nagel RNA purification kit. Complementary DNA was
prepared using the First Strand Superscript II Synthesis System (Invitrogen).
Quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (qRT–PCR) reactions were performed
with the cDNA and gene-specific primers (Supplementary Table 1) and SYBR
green master mix (Bio-Rad). For the experiments in Figs 1 and 5a, PrimePCR
custom plates (Bio-Rad) were used. All the samples were normalized to the Rps18
control with graphs representing data normalized to the indicated comparison
condition.
siRNA experiments. For the siRNA experiments, both control and Prdm1-specific
siRNAs were obtained from Dharmacon (D-001210-01-20, D-043069; sequences in
Supplementary Table 2). Primary TH1 cells were transfected with the indicated
siRNAs on day 5. Following nucleofection with siRNA, primary cells were allowed
to recover in high IL-2 conditions for 24 h before gene expression analysis.
Efficiency of knockdown was determined by qRT–PCR and immunoblot analysis
for Prdm1 transcript and Blimp-1 protein expression, respectively.
Immunoblot analysis. An equal number of cells were collected and subjected
to immunoblot analysis to determine protein expression levels of Bcl-6 (BD
Biosciences, 561520, dilution 1:500), Blimp-1 (Genscript, A01647, dilution 1:500),
STAT5 (Santa Cruz, sc-835, dilution 1:5,000), phospho-STAT5 (pY694, BD
Biosciences, 611964, dilution 1:5,000) and V5-tagged proteins (Invitrogen,
R960-25, dilution 1:5,000). In brief, separation of lysates by SDS–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis was followed by immunoblot analysis. GAPDH (Santa Cruz,
sc-25778, dilution 1:2,500) or b-actin (Genscript, A00730, dilution 1:10,000)
expression was monitored to ensure equal protein loading. Additional information
for antibodies can be found in Supplementary Table 3 and uncropped versions of
all immunoblots are provided in Supplementary Fig. 5.
ChIP assay. The ChIP assay was performed as published12. In brief, chromatin
was harvested from TFH/TCM-like cells treated with and without IL-7 as indicated.

isolated and sorted into effector TFH (Eff TFH) and non-TFH (Eff TH) populations. Non-TFH effector cells were then assessed for IL-7R expression and further
classified as IL-7R low (IL-7RLO) or IL-7R high (IL-7RHI). (b) IL-6Ra expression of the indicated cell population was measured by flow cytometric analysis
(geometric mean fluorescence intensity (geoMFI); mean of n ¼ 5±s.d.). (c) Percent NP-specific distribution of Eff TFH, TH IL-7RLO and TH IL-7RHI cells at
the indicated time points (Day 7, d9, d15, d30, d60) post influenza infection (mean of n ¼ 5±s.d.). **Po0.01 (unpaired Student’s t-test).

 5 mg per IP) or IgG (Abcam, ab6709, 5 mg per IP) control and the precipitated DNA
was analysed by qPCR with gene-specific primers (Supplementary Table 1).
Samples were normalized to a standardized total input DNA control followed by
subtraction of the IgG antibody as a control for the nonspecific background. The
final value represents the percent enrichment of STAT5-specific signal.
Promoter–reporter analysis. Sell ( � 1,755 to þ 79 bp), Ccr7 ( � 1,470 to
þ 113 bp) and Tbx21 ( � 1,893 to þ 194 bp) promoter–reporter vectors were
prepared by cloning regulatory regions of each gene into the pGL3-basic
luciferase reporter construct (Promega). EL4 cells were co-transfected with the
promoter–reporter constructs in combination with the indicated expression vectors
as well as a TK-renilla control plasmid (Promega) to normalize for transfection
efficiency. Transfections were harvested after 16–24 h and samples were analysed
with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter system (Promega).
Flow cytometry. Fluorochrome-labelled a-IL-6Ra (P22272, dilution 1:10), a-IL-7R
(A7R34, dilution 1:10), a-CD62L (95218, dilution 1:20), a-Cxcr5 (614641, dilution
1:10) and respective isotype control antibodies were purchased from R&D. a-Ccr7
(4B12, dilution 1:50), a-IL-2Ra (PC61.5, dilution 1:50), a-IL-7R (SB/199, dilution
1:10) and a-CD62L (MEL-14, dilution 1:100) were purchased from eBioscience.
Non-viable cells were excluded using e520 or e450 viability dye (eBioscience), Sytox
Green or Blue (Life Technologies) or propidium iodide (BD Biosciences). For the
staining procedure, cells were collected on day 6 (3 days post transition to low IL-2
conditions) and subjected to labelling and sorting as indicated. Briefly, cells were
pelleted, washed in 500 ml of 1 � FACS buffer (2% FBS, 1% BSA, 0.1% NaNH3),
and then stained with indicated fluorochrome-conjugated antibody. Following
staining with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies and viability dye, cells were
washed three times in 1 � FACS buffer and then resuspended for analysis on either
an Accuri C6 flow cytometer or Sony SH800. All the obtained data were analysed
using FlowJo Software.
Cell sorting and droplet digital PCR. Day 6 IL-6Ra þ/IL-7R þ DP cells were
sorted (B500,000 cells) using a Sony SH800 using a 100 mm chip under purity-sort
mode and cDNA was prepared as described above (see qRT–PCR). Droplet Digital
PCR reactions were performed using gene-specific primers diluted in 2 � master
mix (Qx200 ddPCR EvaGreen Supermix, Bio-Rad). Droplets were generated using
a Bio-Rad Automated Droplet Generator and end-point PCR was performed.
Droplets were then read using a Qx200 Digital PCR Reader using QuantaSoft
Software (Bio-Rad). All the primers were diluted to optimize signal-to-noise
and thresholds were set using non-template control wells. Absolute counts were
normalized to Rps18 and then fold change was determined.
Influenza virus infections and in vivo analysis. Influenza virus infections were
performed intranasally with 6,500 VFU of A/PR8/34 (PR8) in 100 ml of PBS. Cell
suspensions from mLNs were prepared by passing tissues through nylon mesh.
Cells from mLNs were resuspended in 150 mM NH4Cl, 10 mM KHCO3 and
0.1 mM EDTA for 5 min to lyse red cells. Cell suspensions were then filtered
through a 70 mm nylon cell strainer (BD Biosciences), washed and resuspended in
PBS with 5% donor calf serum and 10 mg ml � 1 FcBlock (2.4G2 -BioXCell) for
10 min on ice before staining with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies or tetramer
reagents. Fluorochrome-labelled a-PD-1 (J43, dilution 1:100), a-IL-7R (A7R34,
dilution 1:100) and a-IL-6Ra (D7725A7, dilution 1:100) were from eBioscience.
Fluorochrome-labelled a-Bcl-6 (K112.91, dilution 1:50), a-Cxcr5 (2G-8, dilution
1:50) and a-CD4 (RM4-5, dilution 1:200) were from BD Biosciences. The
IAbNP311-325 MHC class II tetramer was obtained from the NIH Tetramer Core
Facility and used at a 1:100 dilution. Intracellular staining for Bcl-6 was performed
using the mouse regulatory T-cell staining kit (eBioscience) following the manu-
facturer’s instructions. Flow cytometry was performed using a FACSCanto II (BD
Biosciences) and analysed in FlowJo.
Statistics. All the data represent at least three independent experiments with the
number of biological replicates indicated in the figure legend. Error bars represent
the s.e.m. or s.d. as indicated. For statistical analysis, an unpaired t test was
performed using GraphPad Prism online software. P values o0.05 were considered
statistically significant.
