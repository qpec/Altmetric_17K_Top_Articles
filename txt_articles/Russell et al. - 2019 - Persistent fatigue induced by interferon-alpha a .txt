The role of immune or infective triggers in the pathogenesis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is not yet fully
understood. Barriers to obtaining immune measures at baseline (i.e., before the trigger) in CFS and post-infective
fatigue model cohorts have prevented the study of pre-existing immune dysfunction and subsequent immune
changes in response to the trigger.
This study presents interferon-alpha (IFN-α)-induced persistent fatigue as a model of CFS. IFN-α, which is
used in the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection, induces a persistent fatigue in some in-
dividuals, which does not abate post-treatment, that is, once there is no longer immune activation. This model
allows for the assessment of patients before and during exposure to the immune trigger, and afterwards when the
original trigger is no longer present.
Fifty-five patients undergoing IFN-α treatment for chronic HCV were assessed at baseline, during the 6–12
months of IFN-α treatment, and at six-months post-treatment. Measures of fatigue, cytokines and kynurenine
pathway metabolites were obtained. Fifty-four CFS patients and 57 healthy volunteers completed the same
measures at a one-off assessment, which were compared with post-treatment follow-up measures from the HCV
patients.
Eighteen patients undergoing IFN-α treatment (33%) were subsequently defined as having ‘persistent fatigue’
(the proposed model for CFS), if their levels of fatigue were higher six-months post-treatment than at baseline;
the other 67% were considered ‘resolved fatigue’. Patients who went on to develop persistent fatigue experi-
enced a greater increase in fatigue symptoms over the first four weeks of IFN-α, compared with patients who did
not (Δ Treatment Week (TW)-0 vs. TW4; PF: 7.1 ± 1.5 vs. RF: 4.0 ± 0.8, p = 0.046). Moreover, there was a
trend towards increased baseline interleukin (IL)-6, and significantly higher baseline IL-10 levels, as well as
higher levels of these cytokines in response to IFN-α treatment, alongside concurrent increases in fatigue. Levels
increased to more than double those of the other patients by Treatment Week (TW)4 (p = 0.011 for IL-6 and

T
 p = 0.001 for IL-10). There was no evidence of an association between persistent fatigue and peripheral in-
flammation six-months post-treatment, nor did we observe peripheral inflammation in the CFS cohort. While
there were changes in kynurenine metabolites in response to IFN-α, there was no association with persistent
fatigue. CFS patients had lower levels of the ratio of kynurenine to tryptophan and 3-hydroxykynurenine than
controls.
Future studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms behind the initial exaggerated response of the immune
system in those who go on to experience persistent fatigue even if the immune trigger is no longer present, and
the change from acute to chronic fatigue in the absence of continued peripheral immune activation.
1. Introduction
There is some evidence implicating the immune system in the pa-
thogenesis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), but the exact role of
immune mechanisms in this condition, especially at its onset, have yet
to be established. Genetic polymorphisms in immune genes are asso-
ciated with (CFS) as well as other disease-related fatigue (Wang et al.,
2017). Some recent studies have observed raised inflammatory markers
in CFS patients, both in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (Maes et al.,
2012; Silverman et al., 2010). Increased levels of the inflammatory
biomarker, C-reactive protein, have been described in one of the largest
CFS studies to date (Raison et al., 2009). Moreover, a recent study has
found that 17 cytokines in the serum, mainly pro-inflammatory, cor-
relate with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME)/CFS severity (Montoya
et al., 2017). However, a meta-analysis of findings published up to 2003
found no consistent evidence for immune dysfunction (Lyall et al.,
2003); and a more recent meta-analysis found that, of the 77 markers
measured, only transforming growth-factor beta (TGF-β) was con-
sistently raised (Blundell et al., 2015), a finding also confirmed by the
aforementioned study by Montoya et al. (2017).
To investigate the role of the immune system further, post-infective
fatigue syndrome has been used as a model for CFS. Such studies have
prospectively monitored new cases of infection and found clinical and
socio-demographic factors, as well as genetic and blood immune mar-
kers that were associated with post-infective CFS (Candy et al., 2002;
Hickie et al., 2006; Piraino et al., 2012; Vollmer-Conna et al., 2004).
While this model has the advantage of assessing individuals at the onset
of CFS, no study has been able to assess individuals before and after the
infective trigger, due to the random occurrence of infections; thus we
cannot establish whether pre-existing immune dysfunction char-
acterises individuals at risk of post-infective CFS. The study of persis-
tent fatigue induced by interferon-alpha (IFN-α), a novel model pre-
sented here, allows us to do just that.
IFN-α is administered for the treatment of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)
infection for courses of six months or more. The treatment induces
acute sickness behaviours in the first few weeks, including myalgia,
malaise, anorexia, fatigue, and mild cognitive impairment. Between one
third and half of patients then continue to experience fatigue and
cognitive symptoms, with additional mood disturbance usually occur-
ring after eight to twelve weeks of treatment. These clinical and bio-
logical phenomena have been extensively characterised (Capuron et al.,
2002; Capuron and Miller, 2004; Maddock et al., 2005). Though less
well studied, patients have also reported persistent fatigue six-months
after cessation of IFN-α therapy, with evidence from patients’ surveys
that up to 60% of patients experience fatigue and other persistent CFS-
like symptoms, including cognitive impairment and joint and muscle
aches (Hepatitis and Trust, 2010; Hopwood, 2013). Interestingly, the
original immune trigger (in this case, IFN-α) is no longer present at this
stage, another similarity often noted in CFS. These considerations make
IFN-α a suitable model to mimic the immune trajectory of people who
develop CFS, at baseline (i.e., before the immune trigger), during the
immune trigger, and after the immune trigger has ceased. This is the
first study to investigate IFN-α-induced persistent fatigue in such detail,
and we have examined immunological and psychosocial factors that
predict this condition, in a prospective manner. We have also cross-
sectionally compared these subjects with clinically defined CFS patients
and healthy controls.
This study has explored possible predictors shown previously to be
associated with CFS, CFS-like illnesses and/or IFN-α induced fatigue. In
relation to psychosocial factors, childhood trauma has been identified
as being a risk factor for CFS, as well as ‘CFS-like’ illnesses (Borsini
et al., 2013; Clark et al., 2011; Heim et al., 2009, 2006), and, in-
dependently, for inflammation in adulthood (Danese et al., 2007). Ex-
perience of stressful life events generally may also contribute to the risk
of CFS (Hatcher and House, 2003; Salit, 1997), though another study
found no link with recent stressors in the last 12 months (White et al.,
2001). A personal history of a psychiatric disorder has also been found
to be a risk factor for CFS, with increased levels of psychopathological
symptoms preceding the symptoms of fatigue (Clark et al., 2011;
Harvey et al., 2008). Lastly, the limited studies that have assessed fa-
tigue post-IFN-α treatment have found an association with treatment
outcome, with those with treatment success (sustained viral response,
i.e., treatment success shown as viral RNA undetected six-months post-
treatment) experiencing greater fatigue (Huckans et al., 2015; Sarkar
et al., 2012). All of these clinical variables have been assessed in the
present study.
With regards to biological measures, in addition to the cytokine
measurements referenced above, this study is, to the best of our
knowledge, one of the first studies to examine a wide range of kynur-
enine pathway metabolites both in CFS patients, and in the context of
persistent fatigue following an immune trigger. An imbalance in tryp-
tophan metabolism as prompted by increases in inflammation has been
implicated in the somewhat overlapping groups of symptoms that are
relevant to CFS, spanning pain, fatigue and depression. For example,
quinolinic acid (QUIN) has an excitotoxic effect on the glutamate N-
methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, the stimulation of which may
cause hyperalgesia and central sensitisation, or an increased sensitivity
to pain (Anderson et al., 2014; Romano et al., 2015). Of relevance,
drugs that block the NMDA receptor have shown beneficial effects for
the treatment of pain associated with central sensitisation, as has been
seen in CFS and the associated condition, fibromyalgia (Nijs et al.,
2011). In a study of chronic-activated Epstein-barr virus (CAEBV),
higher fever was significantly associated with a higher kynurenine/
tryptophan (Kyn/TRP) ratio and lower TRP, while there were trends
towards associations between a higher KYN/TRP ratio and severe
tiredness and night sweats (Bellmann-Weiler et al., 2008). This suggests
that inflammation-induced activation of IDO may be relevant for the
persistence of symptoms, including fatigue, following an immune
trigger. The pathway has been extensively studied in depression and
other neuropsychiatric diseases, as well as other medical conditions
where immune activation and inflammation are key features, where
increased ratios of kynurenine to tryptophan have also been found
(Leonard and Maes, 2012; Morris et al., 2015). That said, the literature
relating to CFS specifically is limited, and so this aspect of the approach
can be considered exploratory.

 2.1. Prospective study
We recruited 55 patients (mean age 44.6 ± 1.6 years; 80% male)
from liver outpatient services at King’s College Hospital and five other
hospitals in London. Eligible patients were adults with chronic HCV
infection who were due to commence antiviral therapy with IFN-α and
ribavirin. In addition to IFN-α/rib, eight subjects (14%) were also
prescribed a direct-acting antiviral (‘triple therapy’, adding boceprevir,
telaprevir or simeprevir), after treatment protocols changed across the
UK. The sample is partially overlapping with that in the publication by
Hepgul et al. (2016a, 2016b) (of n = 55, overlap of n = 35), though
post-treatment data was not presented in Hepgul et al.’s paper. Exclu-
sion criteria included any autoimmune disorders or causes of liver
disease other than HCV, and co-infection with HIV or Hepatitis B. All
but 3 patients were free from depression and antidepressants at base-
line. Clinical assessments were conducted at baseline (treatment week
0; TW0), TW4, TW8 and TW12, and at the end of treatment (67% at
TW24, the remaining by TW36 or TW48). This was followed by a fur-
ther assessment six-months after the end of treatment, where the per-
sistent fatigue phenotype was identified. Eighteen patients (33%) were
defined as having ‘persistent fatigue’ (PF; the proposed model for CFS)
if their levels of fatigue were higher at follow-up than at TW0 (mea-
sured using the Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire; see below); the other
67% were defined as having ‘resolved fatigue’ (RF).
2.2. Cross-sectional study
The cross-sectional study compared data at the six-month follow-up
visit (that is, when the CFS-like phenotype of PF was identified) from
the PF and the RF groups as well as patients with clinically-defined CFS
and healthy volunteers (controls). We recruited n = 54 CFS patients
from the CFS specialist clinics at the South London and Maudsley
(SLaM) and the Royal Free NHS Foundation Trusts, diagnosed ac-
cording to the Oxford criteria (Sharpe et al., 1991), and n = 57 healthy
volunteers, free from recent or recurrent mental disorders, including
past or present substance abuse or dependency. Healthy controls were
recruited from a number of sources: advertisements placed on a clas-
sified adverts website (‘Gumtree’); a circular email sent out to all staff
and students of King’s College London; leaflets placed in local com-
munity settings and through word of mouth. Participants in both groups
were excluded if they had significant health conditions known to in-
fluence the immune system.
Consistent with the literature (Alter, 2007; Clark et al., 2011; Jason
et al., 2003), CFS patients were younger than the HCV group and pre-
dominantly female (mean age 37.2 ± 1.5 years and 31% male in CFS
vs. 44.6 ± 1.6 years and 80% male in HCV). Therefore, the controls
were selected to be comparable to the larger group of HCV and CFS
patients combined (mean age 40.8 ± 1.6 years and 49% male in
controls vs. 41.0 ± 1.1 years and 56% male in the combined HCV/CFS
group) (Age: t (165) = -0.88, p = 0.93; Gender: χ2 (1) = 0.79, p =
0.37). A full table of sample characteristics for the HCV cohort, and RF,
PF, CFS and healthy control groups can be found in Supplementary
Table 1.
2.3. Clinical questionnaires
The Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire (CFQ; Chalder et al., 1993) was
used to measure the severity of fatigue in all groups, longitudinally (in
the HCV group) and in the cross-sectional assessment. Scores of ≤18
are considered to be within the normal range for fatigue (Cella and
Chalder, 2010). The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview
(MINI) Major Depression section was administered to diagnose a pre-
vious history of depression or the occurrence of IFN-α-induced de-
pression (Sheehan et al., 1998). The Brief Life Events (BLE) scale was
administered to assess recent stressful events before starting IFN-α
(Brugha and Cragg, 1990). The Childhood Experiences of Care and
Abuse Questionnaire (CECA-Q) was used to collect information about
childhood trauma, in all groups (Bifulco et al., 2005). The Inventory of
Depressive Symptomatology (IDS) was used to measure depressive
symptoms at treatment week 12 of IFN-α treatment in the HCV group
(Rush et al., 1996). For sample characteristics (see Supplementary
Table 1), the Socio-Demographic Schedule (SDS) was used to record
age, gender, ethnicity and employment and relationships status (Mallett
et al., 2002). Family history of mental illness was assessed using the
Family Interview for Genetic Studies (Maxwell, 1992), and smoking and
history of opioid use using a modified version of the Cannabis Experi-
ence Questionnaire (CEQ) (Barkus et al., 2006).
2.4. HCV measures
The HCV RNA viral load test obtained from medical records was
used to assess illness severity at baseline, and treatment response. The
viral load is the number of viral particles per ml of blood, presented in
millions (AmpiliPrep, Roche), where a result of < 15IU/ml equates to
undetected. The test is used at treatment week 4 to assess Rapid
Virological Response (undetected at week 4, indicative of likely later
treatment success), and Sustained Virological Response (undetected six-
months post-treatment, determines treatment outcome). We also ex-
amined the baseline Fibroscan result, an assessment of liver stiffness
indicating the degree of liver damage.
2.5. Biological markers
In the HCV cohort, serum cytokine levels were measured at treat-
ment week (TW)-0, TW4, TW24 and follow-up, and plasma kynurenine
pathway metabolites at TW0, TW8, TW24 and at follow-up. In CFS
patients and controls, all biological markers were measured once, at the
cross-sectional assessment.
2.5.1. Cytokines
Blood samples were collected using 6 ml BD vacutainer plastic tubes
(silica clot activator) and left to clot for at least 30 min at room tem-
perature. The blood was then centrifuged at 1850 g for 10 min at room
temperature, and sera aliquots were stored at −80 °C for later analysis.
Cytokines were measured using Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) V-PLEX
sandwich immunoassays, and plates read on an MSD QuickPlex SQ 120.
Samples were diluted two-fold, and measured in duplicate. MSD Pro-
inflammatory Panel 1 (human) kits were used for the measurement of
IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, and TNF-α,
and a custom Cytokine Panel 1 (human) kit was used for the mea-
surement of IL-7, IL-17 A and VEGF. For the longitudinal study, all
samples from the same patient were analysed together, though due to
the volume of samples, samples were analysed in different batches, on
different days; however, plates were always balanced for the presence
of subjects from each group. The inter-assay coefficient of variations
were < 10%. Levels of IL-4 and IL-1β were not detected or below the
lower limit of detection for most samples, and data are thus not re-
ported here.
2.5.2. Kynurenine pathway metabolites
Blood samples were collected using 9 ml VACUETTE® plasma se-
paration, sodium heparin tubes. Samples were centrifuged at 500 g for
10 min at room temperature, and then plasma aliquots were stored at
-80 for later analysis. The chromatographic system was composed of a
Waters Acquity UPLC separations module connected to a Xevo TQ MS
triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer, equipped with a Z-spray ESI ion
source (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, U.S.). Separation was carried out
using a Kinetex XB-C18, 2.6 μm 2.1 x 150 mm column (Phenomenex,
Torrance, California, U.S.). Analysis of metabolites was conducted using
liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS).
The analytes and internal standards were detected using the multi re-
action monitoring (MRM) technique.

 System operation, data acquisition and data processing were con-
trolled using MassLynx V4.1 software (Waters, Milford, USA). Baseline
and treatment measures were completed in the same individuals in the
same batch. For some individuals in the HCV group, baseline and
treatment assessments were analysed at different times; however, var-
iation across batches was low for the included measures, and mea-
surements conducted later were considered separately in the cross-
sectional analysis. Levels of tryptophan, kynurenic acid, quinaldic acid,
3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), xanthurenic acid, picolinic acid and
quinolinic acid were successfully measured; levels of 5-hydroxy-L-
tryptophan, 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid, anthranilic acid and 3-hy-
droxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA) were all below or around the limit of
quantification, and data are thus not reported here. Raw values for
kynurenine levels in some patients were above the upper limit of
quantification (> 549); outliers greater than three times the inter-
quartile range were excluded, resulting in the exclusion of two patients,
but otherwise these values were included.
2.6. Data analysis
All data were analysed with IBM SPSS statistical software version 22.
Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). For the
longitudinal study, differences between the PF and the RF groups were
examined with a repeated measures analysis of variance, followed by
comparisons using independent t-tests or paired t-tests, as appropriate,
where an effect of IFN-α was shown. For the cross-sectional study, one-
way ANOVAs were performed, followed by post-hoc Tukey’s Honest
Significant Difference (HSD) tests, or Games-Howell tests where Welch’s
ANOVA results are reported. When attempts to address the positive skew
of some datasets through transformation were not successful, a Kruskal-
Wallis or Mann-Whitney U test was performed, as appropriate. For all
categorical variables, chi-squared (χ2) tests were used. Mixed-model
analysis was used for confirmatory analyses when needed.
3. Results
3.1. Subjects who later develop PF have higher fatigue in response to IFN-α
We first analysed the levels of fatigue, before and during IFN-α, in
subjects who later developed persistent fatigue (PF), and those who did
not (resolved fatigue; RF) (see Fig. 1). At baseline (before IFN-α), levels
of fatigue in the two groups were indistinguishable (p = 0.69). More-
over, there was the expected effect of time (F (2.58, 113.43) = 26.53,
p < 0.001), confirming that IFN-α increased fatigue in both groups.
However, the PF group did show an accelerated increase in fatigue
levels by TW4. Specifically, there was a significant time X group in-
teraction (F (2.58, 113.43) = 3.02, p = 0.040) driven by PF subjects
experiencing a greater increase in symptoms over the first four weeks
compared with RF patients (Δ TW0 vs. 4; PF: 7.1 ± 1.5 vs. RF:
4.0 ± 0.8, p = 0.046), with a statistical trend towards higher fatigue in
the PF subjects at TW4 (19.5 ± 1.2 vs. 16.7 ± 0.8, p = 0.057). They
also had a greater increase in fatigue by the end of treatment, relative to
baseline (Δ TW0 vs. End = PF: 10.1 ± 1.8 vs. RF: 5.1 ± 1.1,
p = 0.016), and fatigue scores were significantly higher in PF versus RF
patients
at
the
end
of
treatment
(22.5 ± 1.5
vs.
17.9 ± 1.3,
p = 0.035). Of note, PF was not due to worse recovery from the effects
of IFN-α treatment per se, since the change in fatigue over the six-
months post-treatment showed a similar rate of recovery in both groups
(Δ END vs FU -7.3 ± 1.3 vs. -5.3 ± 1.4, t (49) = -0.96, p = 0.34).
Finally, we examined levels of depressive symptoms at week 4, at
the same time as the increases in fatigue, and week 12, determined by
previous research to be the time at which depressive symptoms induced
by IFN-α reach peak levels. Levels at week 4 were no different between
groups (RF vs. PF, mean ± SEM; 18.9 ± 2.0 vs. 19.9 ± 3.1, t (51) =
-0.31, p = 0.76), and levels at week 12 were numerically higher in the
PF group but with trend-statistical significance (20.09 ± 2.53 vs.
28.00 ± 17.51, t (49) = -1.73, p = 0.09). Taken together, this suggests
that fatigue and depression are at least partially distinct
3.2. Subjects who later develop PF have higher IL-10 levels before treatment,
and IL-6 and IL-10 levels in response to IFN-α
At baseline, there was a statistical trend towards higher IL-6 levels
in the PF group, as well as statistically higher IL-10 levels, compared
with RF patients (see Fig. 2a and b; IL-6, p = 0.073; IL-10, p = 0.034).

 There were no other baseline differences in the other cytokines mea-
sured (see Table 1).
For IL-6, there was a significant effect of time (F (2, 60) = 12.53,
p < 0.001), indicating an increase in response to IFN-α in all subjects.
There was no significant interaction between time and group on levels
of IL-6 (F (2, 60) = 2.17, p = 0.12). However, there was a significant
effect of group (F (1, 30) = 9.73, p = 0.004), indicating that levels were
different between PF and RF. Post-hoc tests revealed that IL-6 values in
PF subjects increased to double those of RF patients by TW4
(p = 0.011) and remained higher at TW24 (p = 0.094) (see Fig. 2a). To
confirm these observations, we supplemented this ANOVA analysis (on
the sample for which IL-6 measures were available at all time-points)
with the assessment of a fixed effect interaction in a mixed model, in
the wider group for which IL-6 measurements were available for at least
one time-point (RF = 34; PF = 15). Employing an autoregressive
covariance structure to account for the repeated measures within pa-
tients, we did find a significant interaction between time and group (F
(5,77) = 5.57, p < 0.001), thus confirming the notion of a differential
effect of IFN-α on IL-6 levels based on ‘persistent fatigue’ status.
For IL-10, there was no effect of time (F (1.58, 44.20) = 1.65, p =
0.21), and there was a trend towards an interaction between time and
group (F (1.58, 44.20) = 3.23, p = 0.057). However, there was a sig-
nificant effect of group (F (1, 28) = 8.86, p = 0.006), indicating again
that levels were different between PF and RF patients. As for IL-6, levels
in PF patients increased to more than double those of RF patients by
TW4, (p = 0.001), though in contrast were reduced to similar levels
across groups by TW24 (p = 0.138) (see Fig. 2b). Using the same ap-
proach described above to confirm these observations model in the
wider group for which IL-10 measurements were available for at least
one time-point, the mixed model demonstrated a slightly more sig-
nificant interaction effect, although still at a statistical trend level (F (5,
82) = 2.29, p = 0.053).
Of note, these early, greater increases in both cytokines in those
who later developed PF occur concurrently to the greater increases in
fatigue over the same period. Spearman’s rho correlation analyses in-
cluding the delta scores (Δ 0 vs. 4) representing change in fatigue and
(i) IL-6 and (ii) IL-10 were performed to explore this link further. In the
whole group, there was no association between changes in fatigue and
IL-6 (rs= -0.13, p = 0.41), nor with changes in IL-10 (rs = 0.13,
p = 0.39). With regards to the effect of IFN-α on other cytokines, only
levels of IL-2, IL-8, IL-17 A and TNF − α increased in response to IFN-α,
as shown by significant effects of time (p < 0.005 for all comparisons,
see Supplementary Table 3). However, there were no interactions be-
tween time and group, nor was there an effect of group, indicating si-
milar changes in both PF and RF groups during IFN-α. There was no
effect of IFN-α on other cytokines (see Supplementary Table 3).
3.3. In the cross-sectional study, patients with the established PF phenotype
and patients with CFS do not show any increase in cytokine levels compared
with control conditions
Having shown that patients who later go on to develop PF have
higher IL-10 before treatment, and higher levels of IL-6 and IL-10
during IFN-α treatment, compared with RF patients, we wanted to test
whether these cytokines continue to be higher in the PF group at follow-
up (six-months post-cessation of IFN-α), when the PF phenotype is es-
tablished; moreover, we wanted to compare levels of cytokines also
with those in patients with CFS and in controls.
In terms of fatigue severity (measured with the CFQ), there were
significant differences between groups (ANOVA, F (3, 58.4) = 154.4,
p < 0.001), with CFS patients having the most severe symptoms
(26.0 ± 0.6; p < 0.001 vs. all other groups) and the PF patients with
an intermediate CFS-like phenotype (17.0 ± 0.8; p < 0.001 vs. RF and
controls), while RF and controls were, expectedly, the lowest and in-
distinguishable (10.6 ± 0.5 and 11.6 ± 0.3, respectively). The more
severe fatigue in CFS patients than in the PF patients is understandable,
considering that they had been referred to a specialist service for
treatment, and the longer length of illness in this group (84 ± 12
months in CFS vs. 6 months in the PF group).
Table 2 presents cytokine levels in the four groups. To limit the
number of statistical comparisons, only the cytokines that were sig-
nificantly regulated by IFN-α were analysed in the cross-sectional as-
sessment.
With regards to IL-10 and IL-6 (the cytokines that distinguished PF
from RF), there were significant differences in the levels of IL-6 and IL-
10 between the four groups (ANOVA, p < 0.001 and p = 0.002, re-
spectively), but PF patients were not different from RF patients, even if
the CFS-like phenotype was established at this time. Moreover, CFS
patients had levels that were lower (IL-6) or indistinguishable (IL-10)
from healthy volunteers (see Table 2). The significant differences be-
tween the groups were driven by levels of IL-6 and IL-10 being higher in
both PF and RF compared with both CFS and controls (see Table 2).
With regards to levels of IL-2, IL-8, IL-17 A and TNF-α (the cytokines
that were regulated by IFN-α but did not distinguish between PF and
RF), for IL-2 there were no significant differences between groups (p =
0.14), while for the others there were significant differences between
the groups (p values ranging < 0.001 - 0.003, see Table 2), and dif-
ferences were all similar to those described for IL-6 and IL-10, i.e.,
higher in both PF and RF groups compared with CFS and controls, but
not different between PF and RF or between CFS and controls.
Taken together, these findings support the notion that the presence
of the CFS phenotype per se does not lead to increased inflammation at
the time in which the CFS phenotype is present, for both IFN-α-induced

 persistent fatigue and clinically-defined CFS. Interestingly, the higher
levels of five out of six cytokines in both PF and RF subjects indicate a
persistent immune activation six months post-cessation of IFN-α, which
is unrelated to fatigue. Of note, this persistent immune activation is
likely due to IFN-α, considering the absence of HCV at this time-point in
the majority of cases (see point 5).
3.4. Kynurenine pathway metabolites change with IFN-α treatment but do
not distinguish PF from RF or CFS from controls
Of the kynurenine pathway markers examined during IFN-α treat-
ment, there were no baseline differences between the RF and PF groups
(data not shown; levels reported in Supplementary Table 4).
During treatment, there was an effect of time (indicating regulation
by IFN-α) on several markers. There was an increase over time in the
levels of kynurenine and of 3-Hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), and of the
ratio of kynurenine to tryptophan (KYN/TRP ratio), and a decrease over
time in kynurenic acid and quinaldic acid (p values ranging < 0.001 –
0.03). There were no significant interactions or group effects, indicating
that, where levels did change, there was a similar effect of IFN-α
treatment in both PF and RF subjects (see Supplementary Table 4).
In the cross-sectional analysis, again to limit the number of statis-
tical comparisons we only analysed the metabolites that were sig-
nificantly
regulated
by
IFN-α
(see
Supplementary
Table
4).
Notwithstanding this conservative approach, this is, to the best of our
knowledge, the largest characterisation of plasma kynurenine metabo-
lites in CFS patients. There were significant differences between the
groups for kynurenine, tryptophan, KYN/TRP ratio, 3-HK, and ky-
nurenic acid (p values ranging < 0.001 – 0.004), but not for quinaldic
acid (p = 0.99). As for the cytokines described above, levels tended to
be higher in PF and RF compared with the other groups, but indis-
tinguishable between PF and RF. Interestingly this was true even of
kynurenic acid and quinaldic acid, which had lowered during IFN-α
treatment, but were either higher or at a similar level to baseline (re-
spectively) when measured again six-months post-treatment.
CFS patients tended to have values that were lower (KYN/TRP ratio
and 3-HK) or indistinguishable (tryptophan, kynurenic acid) than controls.
Taken together, these analyses confirm the activation of the ky-
nurenine pathway in response to an immune trigger, but do not support
a role in CFS and CFS-like syndromes.
3.5. Psychosocial and clinical risk factors do not distinguish PF from RF
subjects
Having provided evidence that PF patients have higher levels of IL-
10 at baseline, and go on to develop more severe fatigue (and stronger
increases in IL-6 and IL-10) already by TW4, we proceeded to in-
vestigate which psychosocial or clinical factors, if any, could explain
the increased sensitivity of PF patients to IFN-α. The psychosocial and
clinical characteristics of the PF and RF groups were similar across all
variables examined (data not all shown; see also Supplementary Table 1
for descriptive data).
Of note, there was no difference in the rate of personal history of
depression (PF 44% vs. RF 32%, p = 0.39) or in the proportion of
patients who reported having experienced at least one stressful life
event in the six-months before the initiation of treatment (PF 39% vs.
RF 49%, p = 0.50). Nor was there a difference in the proportion of
patients who reported at least one form of early life trauma (loss of
parent, separation from parent, physical and/or sexual abuse) (PF 50%
vs. RF 49%, p = 0.93).
In terms of HCV-related clinical factors, there were no significant
differences between groups in any virus or treatment characteristics,
HCV illness severity, or the measures of HCV treatment response to IFN-α
(data not shown; see Supplementary Table 2 for summary information).
Most notably, there was no relationship between IFN-α induced PF and
treatment outcome (virus undetectable in the blood six-months post-
treatment; PF 94% vs. RF 84%, p = 0.27). Incidentally, there was also no
difference in the rate of IFN-α induced depression (PF 50% vs. RF 33.3%,
p = 0.24), suggesting a distinction between this and the PF phenotype.

 4. Discussion
This is the first study to investigate IFN-α induced persistent fatigue
as a proxy model of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. We find that around
30% of patients reported persistent fatigue (PF) at the follow-up six-
months after the end of IFN-α treatment, despite the original immune
stimulus no longer being present. We also find that those who devel-
oped PF have a more rapid increase in fatigue early during IFN-α
treatment, as well as higher IL-10 levels before treatment, and IL-10 and
IL-6 levels early on during IFN-α treatment – that is, more than one year
before the PF phenotype is established. However, this initial immune
activation is no longer associated with PF at the six-month follow-up,
when the PF phenotype is established, nor is it present in a group of CFS
patients used as a clinical reference group.
Of note, PF is not due to worse recovery from the effects of IFN-α
treatment per se, since the changes in clinical symptoms over the six-
months post-treatment reveal a similar rate of recovery in both the PF
and the RF groups. Our study confirms and extends findings from
previous longitudinal studies of post-infective fatigue syndrome, which
have observed greater fatigue at initial presentation to clinics, around
four weeks post-infection, in those who would go on to experience
persistent fatigue (Candy et al., 2003; Hickie et al., 2006; Vollmer-
Conna et al., 2007). Interestingly, by adding a ‘baseline’ assessment
before IFN-α (i.e., equivalent to a hitherto unavailable fatigue mea-
surement before the infection), our study shows that pre-treatment le-
vels of fatigue are not a good predictor of the development of CFS in
response to an immune challenge.
We also find increased (serum) IL-10 in PF patients prior to IFN-α
treatment, and an exaggerated response in IL-10 and IL-6 to IFN-α
during treatment, with higher levels driven by a greater increase in the
first four weeks. The higher TW4 levels of IL-6 in PF persist at TW24,
and represent a greater response in the general IFN-α-induced increase
in IL-6 that is present in all patients. In contrast, the higher TW4 levels
of IL-10 in PF subside by TW24 and are only present in the PF group,
suggesting that the IFN-α-induced increase in this cytokine indicates a
specific sensitivity to an immune stimulus in those who are also at risk
of fatigue-like syndromes. It is also of note that we have recently
published, in a different but overlapping sample of patients taking IFN-
α, that the IFN-α-induced increase in IL-6 levels is not related to the
development of IFN-α-induced depression (Hepgul et al., 2016a,
2016b). Thus, this indicates a specific role of IL-6 in the development of
fatigue. Indeed, also in light of our finding that PF was not associated
with IFN-α-induced depression in the present study, these cytokine data
provide further evidence for a clear distinction between these two
phenotypes. As previously extensively discussed (Dantzer et al., 2014),
IL-6 has been noted as being particularly relevant to fatigue, in relation
to IFN-α induced symptoms as well as other clinical contexts including
cancer. We have also recently shown that IL-6 activates a number of
downstream molecular targets, such as signal transducer and activator
of transcription-1 (STAT1) and aquaporin 4 (Borsini et al., 2018), and
these should be investigated in the context of CFS.
Interestingly, previous studies of post-infective fatigue syndrome
from the Dubbo Infectious Outcomes Study (DIOS) cohort found no
association between acute fatigue and peripheral cytokines in serum,
nor did they find differential levels of cytokines in patients with es-
tablished post-infective fatigue versus those in whom fatigue resolved
(Vollmer-Conna et al., 2007, 2004). The increased cytokine levels at the
time of acute fatigue in our sample, but not in the DIOS study, may be
attributable to the greater increases in cytokines in response to ther-
apeutic doses of IFN-α versus the natural immune response to infection
(Pollmacher et al., 2002). However, the lack of differences in cytokine
levels between patients with established post-infective fatigue and
those in whom fatigue resolved in the DIOS study is consistent with our
study, as we also find that cytokines levels do not distinguish PF from
RF patients at the 6-month follow-up (nor CFS patients from controls).
Taken together, these lines of evidence confirm the notion that, in CFS,
increased immune activation at the time of onset is more relevant than
at the time of the established phenotype. This could explain the in-
consistent findings in the search for an immune abnormality once CFS is
established. To date, and after a multitude of studies, only TGF-β has
been consistently found raised in CFS (Blundell et al., 2015; Montoya
et al., 2017).
Our finding that levels of IL-10 were already higher at baseline in
the PF group, and that baseline levels of IL-6 may also be raised, in the
absence of higher baseline fatigue, may be explained in part by a ge-
netic predisposition. While it does not cause fatigue in itself, greater
fatigue is induced in response to a strong immune challenge, which
then persists. Indeed, this has been explored by studies examining the
variability in response to the same immune challenge. Genetic poly-
morphisms in IL-6 (IL-6 −174 G allele, rs1800795) and IL-10 genes
(-592C allele, rs1800872) have been associated with higher levels of
these markers (Barnes et al., 2017). A study found a protective effect of
the ‘low IL-6’ synthesizing genotype (CC) of a polymorphism in the
promoter region of the IL-6 gene (rs1800795), on IFN-α induced de-
pressive symptoms, although in this case, there was no association with
IFN-α induced acute fatigue (Bull et al., 2009). Another study found no
association between rs1800795 and CFS (Carlo-Stella et al., 2006) or
acute fatigue in a PIFS cohort (Piraino et al., 2012), though it was
linked with greater mood disturbance during the sickness phase
(Piraino et al., 2012). A study of the Dubbo Infectious Outcomes Study
(DIOS) post-infective fatigue syndrome (PIFS) cohort found that the
interleukin-10 -592C/A polymorphisms were significantly associated
with illness severity, cytokine protein levels and the duration of illness
in those with an infectious disease. However, somewhat converse to our
findings, the authors observed that those with the genotype associated
with higher production of IL-10 (-592CC) were at lower risk of ex-
periencing severe symptoms during the acute illness phase, versus those
with the CA or AA genotypes (Vollmer-Conna et al., 2008). A study of a
cohort from the same group found that individuals with the -592C allele
were also less likely to experience neurocognitive effects or mood dis-
turbances during the acute sickness phase (Piraino et al., 2012). Of
note, however, is that in our PF group, while IL-10 did only appear to
increase in PF patients, this effect was only in the initial response, and
did decline over time, perhaps indicative of the effects of different cy-
tokines and different points in response to IFN-α.
This study also presents, to our knowledge, one of the largest
characterisations of plasma kynurenine metabolites in patients with
CFS or a CFS-like syndrome. With reference to longitudinal changes in
response to IFN-α, while levels of some of the kynurenine pathway
metabolites changed (KYN/TRP ratio, kynurenic acid, quinaldic acid
and 3-HK), confirming the well-established activation of the kynurenine
pathway, these changes were not associated with the later development
of PF. Interestingly, previous studies have shown that activation of the
kynurenine pathway is associated with depression and somatic symp-
toms, including fatigue, during IFN-α (Anderson et al., 2014; Leonard
and Maes, 2012) or viral infection with Chronic Active Epstein Barr
virus (Bellmann-Weiler et al., 2008). Indeed, the latter study found that
lower tryptophan and higher indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)-ac-
tivity were associated with more severe symptoms (tiredness, fever and
night sweats) during the Chronic Epstein Barr infection. However, likely
due to low numbers experiencing post-infective fatigue (4–8 months
later), they did not assess any longitudinal relationship between early
IDO activation and later post-infective fatigue (Bellmann-Weiler et al.,
2008).
In our cross-sectional comparison, again we find a similar pattern as
seen for cytokines, that is there is no increased activation of the ky-
nurenine pathway in PF (compared with RF) or CFS patients (compared
with controls), although both PF and RF showed evidence of activation
(compared with the other two groups). Interestingly, however, levels of
the KYN/TRP ratio and 3-HK were lower in CFS patients than controls,
while the tryptophan levels were similar to controls. This lower KYN/
TRP ratio in CFS (and the lack of association with PF) is somewhat in

282
 opposition to a study of somatization which observed higher levels of
the KYN/TRP ratio (Maes et al., 2011). This evidence points again to a
different biological underpinning of primarily psychiatric syndromes,
such as depression and somatization, as opposed to CFS. This notion is
further supported by the lack of an association, in our study, between
PF and any of the classic, stress-related risk factors for psychiatric
disorders. Targeting the kynurenine pathway, through antidepressants
or nutritional interventions, may thus not be a relevant therapeutic
strategy in CFS (Borsini et al., 2017).
The prospective design gives this study a unique ability to measure
fatigue changes in individuals while also taking into consideration
baseline (pre-morbid) symptoms, and it is further strengthened by the
exclusion of patients with other conditions that can impact fatigue or
inflammation, and the presence of the clinical reference group of pa-
tients with CFS. Nevertheless, a few limitations should also be men-
tioned. First, we acknowledge that we can only speculate at this stage
on whether or not the mechanisms underlying the persistence of fatigue
in CFS and IFN-α induced PF are related. However, in order to progress
in the field of CFS/ME it is vital to take advantage of opportunities to
learn more from other overlapping conditions, and it is especially im-
portant to collect evidence that could be relevant for earlier stages of
CFS. The benefit of our proxy model is this opportunity to capture
measures before and during the response to an early immune trigger,
which would be impossible to achieve in a CFS population within the
remit of available resources. Nevertheless, this remains a ‘proxy model’
and its validity and relevance for patients with CFS must be confirmed
by converging evidence from other, similar proxy-model studies. In
addition, the differences between the HCV and CFS populations were
such that it was not possible to recruit a matched CFS group (e.g. 80 vs.
31% males between groups). The healthy control group were therefore
matched to the combined HCV and CFS group. Also of relevance, the
CFS sample was recruited from a specialist service, and thus had an
established diagnosis and long (average of 7 years) duration of illness,
and as such were different from the PF groups that only had 6 months of
post- IFN-α fatigue. However, in using CFS patients recruited in this
way, we could ensure that all patients were diagnosed in a standardised
manner, by trained doctors who were experienced in conducting such
assessments. Of note, our approach to categorise fatigue as ‘resolved’
(returned to the same level or lower than baseline), and ‘persistent’
(higher than baseline) may also attract some criticism given that this
could mean that even a 1-point change on the CFQ can determine the
classification. However, we believe this to be justified in order for us to
focus on change in the individual in response to the trigger, where
baseline fatigue is acknowledged, and in the context of additional
changes in fatigue during IFN-α. It makes the best of the availability of
baseline measurements in this smaller sample. The fact that we were
able to identify group differences in cytokine changes during IFN-α
treatment further strengthens the validity of our approach. Regarding
the changes in IL-6 and IL-10, although the univariate analyses in-
dicated a greater change in patients who would go on to experience
persistent fatigue, these were not of significant magnitude to reach
statistical significance in a ANOVA group x time interaction in the
sample for which all cytokine measurements were available for all time-
points. While a mixed model analysis in the larger samples for which
cytokines measurements were available for at least one time-point
showed a significant interaction for IL-6 and a stronger trend-level
(p = 0.053) for IL-10, the lack of significant interactions in the primary
analyses is a limitation that should be taken into consideration, and the
finding should be replicated in a larger study. Finally, due to the sample
size there was no correction for multiple comparisons; however, we
aimed to limit the number of statistical comparisons by pre-selecting
the cytokines to measure at the different stages of the study. One im-
portant point, though not necessarily a limitation as such, is that since
the study was conducted there have been significant advances in the
field of HCV treatment such that IFN-α free regimens now dominate, at
least in developing countries. The direct acting antivirals (DAAs) re-
ferenced in our patient sample (Boceprevir, Telaprevir and Simeprevir)
have since been overtaken by other more efficient, better tolerated
DAAs. However, there are still cost considerations related to the pre-
scription of the newer drugs. IFN-α and ribavirin remains an effective,
cost effective option, and is still recommended for the treatment of mild
chronic HCV, meaning that while more difficult, it may still be possible
to replicate our findings in a similar cohort (National Institute for
Health and Clinical Excellence, 2018). In addition, immune challenges
such as typhoid vaccine and lipopolysaccharides can also be used in
experimental medicine studies in order to replicate our findings.
In conclusion, findings from this study support the hypothesis that
abnormal immune mechanisms are important in CFS, but only early in
the course of the illness, around the time of the trigger, rather than
when the syndrome is established. Moreover, our study confirms the
importance of the acute fatigue response to the trigger, rather than of
the recovery period preceding the illness. Future research will need to
examine the molecular mechanisms that underlie an exaggerated im-
mune response and that are involved in the conversion from acute to
persistent fatigue symptoms.
