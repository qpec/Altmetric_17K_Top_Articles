Abstract
Background
While current research is largely consistent as to the harms of heavy drinking in terms of
both cancer incidence and mortality, there are disparate messages regarding the safety of
light-moderate alcohol consumption, which may confuse public health messages. We
aimed to evaluate the association between average lifetime alcohol intakes and risk of both
cancer incidence and mortality.
Methods and findings
We report a population-based cohort study using data from 99,654 adults (68.7% female),
aged 55–74 years, participating in the U.S. Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO)
Cancer Screening Trial. Cox proportional hazards models assessed the risk of overall and
cause-specific mortality, cancer incidence (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer), and com-
bined risk of cancer and death across categories of self-reported average lifetime alcohol
intakes, with adjustment for potential confounders. During 836,740 person-years of follow-
up (median 8.9 years), 9,599 deaths and 12,763 primary cancers occurred. Positive linear
associations were observed between lifetime alcohol consumption and cancer-related mor-
tality and total cancer incidence. J-shaped associations were observed between average
lifetime alcohol consumption and overall mortality, cardiovascular-related mortality, and
combined risk of death or cancer. In comparison to lifetime light alcohol drinkers (1–3 drinks
per week), lifetime never or infrequent drinkers (<1 drink/week), as well as heavy (2–<3
drinks/day) and very heavy drinkers (3+ drinks/day) had increased overall mortality and
combined risk of cancer or death. Corresponding hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) for combined risk of cancer or death, respectively, were 1.09 (1.01–1.13) for
never drinkers, 1.08 (1.03–1.13) for infrequent drinkers, 1.10 (1.02–1.18) for heavy drinkers,
and 1.21 (1.13–1.30) for very heavy drinkers. This analysis is limited to older adults, and
residual confounding by socioeconomic factors is possible.

Author summary
Why was this study done?
• The detrimental health impacts of heavy alcohol intakes are well known, and even light-
moderate alcohol intakes have been linked to increased risks of cancer.
• However, light-moderate drinking has also been suggested to be protective for cardio-
vascular disease, which has led to contradictory public health messages. We conducted
this study to further understand the complex relationship between light-moderate alco-
hol consumption, cancer, and mortality.
What did the researchers do and find?
• We analysed whether risk of cancer or death differed in individuals with different life-
time alcohol intakes, using data from approximately 100,000 individuals in the United
States.
• The results suggested that risk of some cancers increased with each additional alcoholic
drink per week consumed.
• However, combined risk of cancer or death was lowest in light drinkers consuming less
than 1 drink per day, rather than drinkers with higher intakes.
What do these findings mean?
• These results could help inform future US guidelines, which currently recommend less
than 2 drinks per day for men and less than 1 drink per day for women.
• This evidence should not be taken to support a protective effect of light drinking.
Introduction
Alcohol consumption appears to have a complex and somewhat controversial relationship to
health [1–4]. The “J-shaped” relationship between alcohol intake and mortality, particularly
from cardiovascular disease, observed in various cohort studies has been well cited within both
scientific and mainstream publications [5–8]. However, concerns over the quality of the

 evidence supporting the J-shaped association [1,2], combined with alcohol’s role as a risk fac-
tor for a range of cancers [9,10], has led to conflicting messages surrounding the health impli-
cations of light to moderate alcohol consumption.
Criticisms over the quality of evidence supporting a J-shaped association with mortality
often surround the methods used to assess and categorise alcohol intakes [2,11]. Many of the
previous cohort studies assessing the role of alcohol in mortality and cancer have focussed on
alcohol intakes measured at baseline, with former drinkers excluded from current drinker cat-
egories [11]. However, this approach may lead to an underestimation of the negative health
effects of drinking alcohol, as former drinkers may have stopped drinking due to adverse
health effects or health scares related to their drinking habits [1,2]. Measurement of alcohol
intakes over an individual’s lifetime and classification according to average lifetime alcohol
intakes helps to avoid the bias that occurs when separating former drinkers from current
drinkers and gives a more comprehensive assessment of an individual’s drinking habits.
To date, few studies [5,6,12] have evaluated average lifetime alcohol consumption and mor-
tality [13], which could help clarify the association. No studies of lifetime alcohol intake, to our
knowledge, have examined the impact on mortality and cancer risk simultaneously, to allow a
direct comparison of alcohol’s association with both important health outcomes.
A more comprehensive overview of alcohol and risk of cancer and death outcomes would
also help to provide clearer guidelines on alcohol consumption. The 2015–2020 U.S. Dietary
Guidelines for Americans currently recommend less than 1 drink per day in women and less
than 2 drinks per day in men [14].
In this study, we aimed to simultaneously examine the association between average lifetime
alcohol intake and mortality as well as cancer risk in a large cohort with prospective follow-up
data. We also conducted a novel analysis of combined risk of cancer incidence or death, to
account for differences in timing and absolute risk of these outcomes.
Methods
Study population
The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial is a randomised trial
designed to evaluate the impact of screening modalities on cancer mortality, as described previously
[15]. Briefly, 154,952 individuals, aged 55–74 years, were recruited via 10 centres in the US (Bir-
mingham, Alabama; Boulder, Colorado; Detroit, Michigan; Honolulu, Hawaii; Los Angeles, Cali-
fornia; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Salt Lake City, Utah; St. Louis, Missouri;
Marshfield, Wisconsin; Washington, DC) between 1993 and 2001. All participants provided written
informed consent and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the National
Cancer Institute and the 10 recruitment centres. This study is reported as per the Strengthening the
Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines (S1 Checklist).
Assessment of demographic and lifestyle variables
At study entry, participants self-completed a baseline questionnaire, which enquired informa-
tion on demographic variables, including age, gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, educa-
tional attainment, personal and family medical history, tobacco smoking habits (including
duration and frequency), medication use, and anthropometry.
Alcohol use assessment
Alcohol consumption was assessed using the validated PLCO Diet History Questionnaire
(DHQ) [16], which was introduced into the trial in December 1998 and was completed by
Lifetime alcohol use, mortality, and cancer risk

 approximately 77% of all participants in both arms of the trial. Participants recruited after
1998 completed the DHQ at baseline for the nonscreening arm and approximately 3 years
after baseline for the screening arm, whereas previously recruited participants were invited to
complete the DHQ in 1999 or 2000.
The DHQ assessed historical drinking by inquiring about the amount of beer (12 ounce
bottles or cans: 1 U.S. Department of Agriculture My Pyramid cup equivalent [17]), wine (5
ounce glasses: 1 cup equivalent), and liquor (1.5 ounce shots, including mixed drinks: 1 cup
equivalent) the participant consumed per week between the ages of 18 and 24, 25 and 39, 40
and 54 years old, and at 55+ years, respectively. The DHQ also inquired about the amount and
frequency the participant drank beer, wine (or wine coolers), and liquor (including liquor in
mixed drinks) over the previous summer, as well as the rest of the previous year, to account for
seasonal differences. The frequency was converted into days and an average daily alcohol
intake of each type of alcohol was calculated as follows (using midpoints where necessary):
ðamount�frequency in summer þ ðamount�frequency for the rest of the year�3ÞÞ=4
Categories of average lifetime alcohol intake
Average lifetime alcohol intake was calculated as a weighted average by multiplying the daily
alcohol intake by the number of years in each age category and adding the categories together
(e.g., intakes at 18–24 accounted for 7 years and intakes in the year prior to DHQ accounted
for 1 year). Never drinkers were defined as having reported no alcohol consumption at any
age. For some analyses, categories of drinking (infrequent drinkers [>0–<1 drinks/week],
light drinkers [1–<3 drinks/week], somewhat light drinkers [3–<5 drinks/week], light-moder-
ate drinkers [5–<7 drinks/week], moderate drinkers [1–<2 drinks/day], heavy drinkers [2–<
3 drinks/day], very heavy drinkers [3+ drinks/day]) were chosen to be narrow enough to iden-
tify differences between groups and to allow relative comparability to previous studies [5],
whilst being easily interpreted without limiting statistical power. The light drinker (1–<3
drinks/week) category was chosen as the reference category for mortality and combined out-
comes, as these individuals were hypothesised to have the lowest mortality. The never drinker
category was chosen as the reference category for risk of cancer, as it was hypothesised that
these individuals would have the lowest cancer risk.
Outcome assessment
Vital status during follow-up was ascertained by annual mailed questionnaires and periodic
linkage to the National Death Index. We used International Classification of Diseases, 9th
Revision (ICD-9), codes to classify the underlying cause of death specified on the death certifi-
cate. Causes of death, in order, were defined as follows: cardiovascular disease, including heart
disease (ICD-9 codes 390–398, 402, 404, and 410–429) and stroke (ICD-9 codes 430–434 and
436–438); cancer (ICD-9 codes 140–239).
Cancer diagnoses were ascertained through assessment of medical records from follow-up
investigations following screening by trained personnel, through annual questionnaires, and
linkage to the National Death Index. All cancers were pathologically confirmed through medi-
cal record abstraction by trained personnel. Total cancer includes incident cancers diagnosed
after completion of DHQ but prior to death, excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer. Alcohol-
related cancers include breast cancer, colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer, liver cancer,
and esophageal cancer [10,18].
The primary outcomes of interest were overall mortality (death from any cause), mortality
from cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as total cancer risk (incidence of any cancer,
excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and a novel analysis, which classed either incidence of

 any cancer (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) or death from any cause as the event of
interest. Deaths from homicides, suicide or accidents, and other causes of death were reported
as secondary outcomes. Follow-up time was calculated from the date of DHQ completion to
the first of either death, 13 years after randomisation or 31 December 2009, or date of first inci-
dence of any cancer (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) in analyses including cancer as an
outcome.
Cohort selection
A total of 154,952 individuals agreed to participate in the trial. Individuals who died or were
diagnosed with cancer prior to or on the date of DHQ were excluded (n = 10,096). Individuals
who did not complete the baseline questionnaire (n = 4,920) or the DHQ (n = 33,245), did not
have valid DHQ (n = 5,221), or had missing information for alcohol or key confounders
(n = 1,761) were excluded. After exclusions, 99,654 individuals were eligible for analysis, of
whom 9,599 died from any cause and 12,763 were diagnosed with any cancer (excluding non-
melanoma skin cancer). A STROBE flowchart of participant selection is included in Fig 1.
Statistical analysis
Chi-squared tests (categorical variables) and ANOVA tests (continuous variables) were used
to assess the association between baseline characteristics and average lifetime alcohol intakes.
Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and corre-
sponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between average lifetime alcohol
intake and each outcome (all-cause mortality, cardiovascular-related mortality, cancer-related
mortality, and cancer incidence, including total and alcohol-related cancers), in men and
women separately. Age was used as the underlying timescale in all analyses [19]. Random
effects meta-analyses using the inverse variance as the weight were used to provide a combined
estimate across men and women for each level of intake.

 Adjusted models included race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Asian,
Hispanic/Other), study centre, randomisation group (control group or screening group), body
mass index (BMI), year of DHQ completion, smoking status by pack-years (never smokers,
former smoker reporting �25 pack-years, former smoker reporting �25 pack-years, current
reporting �25 pack-years, current reporting �25 pack years, cigar/pipe only smokers), marital
status, education, family history of cancer (cancer outcomes only), intakes of total energy
(kcal/day), calcium, red meat, processed meat, fiber, coffee, fruit and vegetables, and meno-
pausal hormone replacement therapy use (HRT, in women only). No model selection for con-
founders was done, as recommended by the reviewer; all variables were included. At the
reviewer’s suggestion, BMI, intakes of total energy, calcium, red meat, processed meat, fiber,
coffee, fruit and vegetables were included as continuous variables instead of categorical
variables.
Restricted cubic spline models [20] were fitted with varying number of knots to assess the
dose-response trend in the association between average lifetime alcohol intake (as a continu-
ous variable) and each outcome after full adjustment. Never drinkers were classified as the ref-
erence category for all restricted cubic spline analyses due to methodological constraints.
Akaike’s information criterion [21] and likelihood ratio tests were used to investigate if there
was a significant improvement to the model fit when fitting restricted cubic spline models,
with varying number of knots, compared to a linear model with average lifetime alcohol intake
as a continuous variable. If the linear model provided the best fit for an outcome, Cox propor-
tional hazards models were conducted, including average lifetime alcohol intakes as a continu-
ous variable.
A priori stratified analyses were conducted by age (<65 versus 65+), randomisation group
(control versus screening arm), BMI (>18.5–<25 versus >25 kg/m2), and smoking status
(ever versus never) among the entire cohort (without gender stratification to ensure adequate
statistical power) using restricted cubic splines for total mortality and total cancer risk. Sec-
ondary analyses reported results for primary outcomes and secondary outcomes from Cox
proportional hazards models using alternative reference categories to those used in main anal-
yses: never drinkers for mortality outcomes and light drinkers for cancer incidence outcomes.
Further outcomes evaluated included mortality from accidents/injuries/homicide/suicide and
mortality from any other cause, as well as risk of alcohol-related cancers, other cancers, and
individual types of cancer (including all alcohol-related cancers and PLCO cancers). Post hoc
sensitivity analyses based on suggestions from reviewers also assessed overall mortality in cur-
rent and former drinkers relative to never drinkers and the association between lifetime alco-
hol consumption with and death from any cause within cancer patients.
Restricted cubic splines were also used to assess the association between different types of
alcohol (beer, wine, and liquor) and overall mortality and cancer incidence (accounting for
intakes of other types of alcohol). A 2-tailed p-value < 0.05 was considered significant and
analyses were conducted using Stata/SE statistical software (version 14.0, College Station, TX,
USA). A copy of the research proposal is included in the supplementary material (S1 Text).
Results
Participant characteristics
Our analysis included 99,654 individuals, including 51,306 women (68.7%) and 48,348 men
(31.3%). The median follow-up time was 8.9 years, with 9,599 deaths and 12,763 primary can-
cers recorded over a total 836,740 person-years of follow-up. Drinking patterns differed
between men and women, with the proportion of women compared to men higher amongst
never and infrequent drinkers and lower amongst moderate, heavy, and very heavy drinkers

 (Table 1). The average median lifetime alcohol intake was 1.78 drinks per week (0.25 per day),
with men reporting higher intakes (4.02 drinks/week) than women (0.80 drinks per week).
In men, heavier drinkers were less likely to be married or have completed a university
degree; more likely to be smokers or obese; and tended to have lower intakes of fruits and vege-
tables, dietary fibre, and total calcium. Similar patterns were apparent in women, although
never and infrequent drinkers tended to be more similar to very heavy drinkers (3+ drinks per
day) than light-moderate drinkers in terms of university education and obesity. HRT use was
least common amongst never drinkers (Table 1).
Average lifetime alcohol consumption and mortality
Total mortality.
Restricted cubic splines analyses indicated J-shaped relationships
between average lifetime alcohol intakes and risk of overall mortality, with risk of death lowest
amongst those whose intakes were below 0.5 drinks per day, with increasing risk at higher
intakes (Fig 2A, S1 Fig).
In men and women, in comparison to light drinkers (1–3 drinks per week), lifetime never
drinkers, infrequent drinkers (<1 drink/week) as well as heavy drinkers (2–<3 drinks/day),
and very heavy drinkers (3+ drinks/day) had an increased risk of mortality (Fig 3). The corre-
sponding HRs (and 95% CI) among men and women, respectively, were 1.25 (1.11–1.40) and
1.29 (1.14–1.46) for never drinkers, 1.14 (1.04–1.24) and 1.23 (1.12–1.35) for infrequent drink-
ers, 1.19 (1.07–1.32) and 1.38 (1.07–1.78) for heavy drinkers, and 1.36 (1.23–1.50) and 1.99
(1.51–2.64) for very heavy drinkers (Fig 3). No major differences were observed by age, smok-
ing status, BMI, or randomisation group (S2 Fig).
When assessing intakes in the year prior to DHQ, former drinkers (HR 1.12, 95% CI 1.04–
1.22) and heavy current drinkers (>2 drinks per day, HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.03–1.42) were at an
increased risk of death compared to never drinkers. Light-moderate drinkers were at a reduced
risk of death (>0–<2 drinks per day, HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.74–0.86).
Cause-specific mortality.
Analyses of specific causes of mortality also revealed J-shaped
associations for cardiovascular-related mortality (Fig 2B) but a linear association for cancer-
related mortality (Fig 2C). Cardiovascular-related mortality was increased in lifetime never
drinkers (HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.26–1.98) and infrequent drinkers (HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.15–1.65) in
women, and very heavy drinkers (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.05–1.47) in men compared to lifetime
light drinkers (S1 Table and S2 Table). Cancer-related mortality was increased in heavy drink-
ers in both men (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.04–1.48) and women (HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.06–2.18) and
very heavy drinkers in men (HR 1.23, 95% CI 1.03–1.47) compared to lifetime light drinkers;
especially for mortality from alcohol-related cancers (S1 Table and S2 Table). Similar results
were apparent when assessing deaths from any cause within cancer patients. Among men diag-
nosed with cancer, higher risks of death were observed for never drinkers (HR 1.20, 95% CI
1.00–1.46) and very heavy drinkers (HR 1.27, 95% CI 1.08–1.50) relative to light drinkers. A J-
shaped association was apparent for mortality from other nonviolent causes but not for mor-
tality due to homicide, suicide, or accidents (S1 Table and S2 Table).
Average lifetime alcohol and cancer incidence
Analyses indicated that average lifetime alcohol intakes were linearly associated with total risk
of cancer (Fig 2D) and risk of ‘alcohol-related’ cancers (Fig 2E). Light-moderate drinkers (HR
1.09, 95% CI 1.00–1.20) and heavy drinkers (HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.00–1.24) were at an increased
risk of cancer overall (when combining men and women) when compared to never drinkers
(Fig 4). When average lifetime alcohol was assessed as a continuous variable, each additional
drink per day was associated with a small increase in total risk of cancer in men (HR 1.01, 95%

 CI 1.00–1.02). No major differences were observed by age, smoking status, BMI, or randomisa-
tion group (S3 Fig), but differences by type of alcohol were observed (S4 Fig). Risk of ‘alcohol-
related’ cancer was 66% higher in very heavy drinkers than in never drinkers in men (HR 1.66,
95% CI 1.16–2.38). Each additional drink per day was associated with an increased risk of
‘alcohol-related’ cancers in men (HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.04–1.08). Analyses by type of cancer
revealed very heavy drinking was associated with increased risk of head and neck cancers (HR
3.12, 95% CI 1.54–6.34), liver cancer (HR 3.53, 95% CI 1.26–9.87), and esophageal cancer (HR
3.99, 95% CI 1.47–10.82) (S3 Table).
Average lifetime alcohol intake and combined risk of cancer or death
A J-shaped relationship was apparent between average lifetime alcohol intakes and combined
risk of cancer or death, with the lowest risk observed at intakes between 1 and 5 drinks per
week (Fig 2F, S1 Fig). Never, infrequent, moderate, and very heavy drinkers had a higher com-
bined risk of cancer or death than light drinkers (1–<3 drinks/week) overall (men and women
combined) with HRs of 1.07 (95% CI 1.01–1.13) for never drinkers, 1.08 (95% CI 1.03–1.13)
for infrequent drinkers, 1.10 (95% CI 1.02–1.18) for heavy drinkers, and 1.21 (95% CI 1.13–
1.30) for very heavy drinkers. Results were similar for women alone, whereas in men the differ-
ences were only statistically significant for heavy (HR 1.09, 95% CI 1.01–1.18) and very heavy
drinkers (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.10–1.28) (Fig 5).
Discussion
In this analysis, we observed nonlinear, “J-shaped” associations between average lifetime alco-
hol consumption and overall and cardiovascular-related mortality. Light lifetime alcohol con-
sumption was associated with reduced overall and cardiovascular-related mortality compared
to never drinking. Higher average lifetime alcohol consumption was also linearly associated
with increased cancer-related mortality and cancer incidence. Combining the risk of cancer
and death into a single analysis attenuated the modest reduction in risk observed for light
drinkers, suggesting only a small benefit in risk for light drinkers compared to never drinkers.
Whilst existing research is largely consistent as to the harms of heavy drinking in terms of
both cancer incidence and overall mortality, there are disparate messages regarding the safety
of light to moderate alcohol consumption. Some argue that there is ‘no safe limit of alcohol’,
largely on the basis of increased cancer incidence [22,23], and others emphasise the potential

 benefits for reducing cardiovascular mortality [3,24]. The results for lifetime alcohol consump-
tion when mortality and cancer incidence were assessed separately in the current study were
similarly disparate. The analysis of combined risk of death and cancer incidence aimed to
account for these disparate associations. The results indicate that the J-shaped association and
risk reductions observed for light alcohol intakes remained, albeit slightly attenuated, with
small reductions in combined risk at light intakes (between 1 and <5 drinks per week). This
study adds to the limited evidence base for women [13] and indicates the lowest combined risk
of death and cancer incidence is at lighter intakes in both men and women. These results
could help inform future US guidelines, which currently recommend less than 2 drinks per
day for men and less than 1 drink per day for women [14]. The United Kingdom recently low-
ered their guidelines for men to recommend less than 14 units (about 1 drink) per week, sev-
eral alcohol-free days per week, and limiting the total amount of alcohol in one session [23].
Mendelian randomisation studies indicating beneficial effects of alleles associated with
reduced alcohol intakes on cardiovascular outcomes are consistent with our findings and
could also inform these debates [25]. Further studies incorporating other major sources of
morbidity, such as dementia [4,26], may better inform public health guidelines on the health
impact of light drinking.
This large cohort study had a number of strengths and limitations. Previous studies report-
ing a J-shaped association between lifetime alcohol consumption and mortality have been crit-
icised for measuring alcohol consumption at a single time point and separating ‘unhealthy’
former drinkers from current drinkers [11,27]. By examining the use of lifetime alcohol con-
sumption, we were able to limit this potential bias. The present study is also, to our knowledge,
the first study with prospective follow-up to assess the association between lifetime alcohol
consumption and overall cancer risk.
Other studies have been criticised for having broader categories of consumption and advo-
cating a reduction in mortality at implausibly low intakes [11]. In our study, we included a sep-
arate category for infrequent lifetime drinkers (>0–<1) to examine infrequent drinking more
closely. The increased mortality in infrequent drinkers compared to light drinkers in our study
suggests that these groups are indeed different and could explain why a systematic review
found no reduction in mortality amongst ‘low volume drinkers’, which includes both infre-
quent and moderate drinkers (up to 2 drinks per day) [11]. The narrower classification of alco-
hol intakes used in the current study may have limited the statistical power to assess
associations by cancer type.
The current study also had a larger proportion of never drinkers than a previous analysis of
lifetime alcohol consumption from Europe [5]. This allowed for a more powerful assessment
of the relative mortality between never drinkers and light drinkers. However, as an indirect
consequence, the assessment of heavy drinking in women was limited by a smaller number of
women reporting average lifetime alcohol consumption over 2 drinks per day in the current
study.
Unlike many previous analyses, which focused on baseline or current consumption [24],
this study assessed the risk associated with average lifetime alcohol consumption from the age

 of 18. However, persons were not enrolled in the study until after the age of 55 years and after
DHQ completion. Thus, the study reflects mortality in older adults and the impact of alcohol
consumption on mortality at younger ages could not be assessed, which could have been
impacted by deaths from accidents, violence, or suicide [11,27], in particular. However, similar

 associations between alcohol and overall mortality have been seen previously in younger adults
[24], which may alleviate concerns of an impact due to selection bias.

 It is also possible that a certain degree of misclassification of alcohol consumption occurred
due to social desirability bias or recall issues, particularly amongst individuals with infrequent
alcohol consumption [28]. In addition, an assessment of episodic, binge drinking was not pos-
sible with the data collected in this study, although binge drinking is unlikely to exaggerate

 reductions in risk within light drinkers. We also did not have information on individuals who
did not complete the DHQ, which also raises the potential for selection bias.
The role of socioeconomic status in health is also a potential source of confounding, as high
socioeconomic status is associated with light-moderate alcohol intakes and better mortality
outcomes [29,30]. Whilst we adjusted for educational attainment, smoking status, and various
dietary factors that may be reflective of socioeconomic status, residual confounding is possible.
Similarly, we were unable to adjust for physical activity, which could also be a source of resid-
ual confounding. Consistent with other screening trials, participants in the PLCO trial are
more highly educated and less likely to smoke than the general population [31], suggesting
that they are more homogenous than the US population at large. Thus, whilst the generalizabil-
ity of findings may be weaker, the impact of such residual confounding is likely to be small.
Finally, we were unable to evaluate cardiovascular disease incidence in this study, which would
complement our analysis.
Conclusions
The study supports a J-shaped association between alcohol and mortality in older adults,
which remains after adjustment for cancer risk. The results indicate that intakes between 1 and
<5 drinks per week were associated with the lowest combined risk of cancer or death. This
study provides further insight into the complex relationship between alcohol consumption,
cancer incidence, and disease mortality and may help inform public health guidelines.
