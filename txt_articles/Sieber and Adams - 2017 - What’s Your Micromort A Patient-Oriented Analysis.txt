What’s Your Micromort? A Patient-Oriented 
Analysis of Breast Implant-Associated 
Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (BIA-ALCL)
David A. Sieber, MD; and William P. Adams Jr, MD
Abstract
Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) continues to be a rare and elusive malignancy. Because BIA-ALCL does not behave 
like traditional lymphomas, additional research needs to be conducted to further delineate the lymphoproliferative nature of BIA-ALCL. An estimated 35 
million women worldwide have breast implants and the total reported deaths from BIA-ALCL is 12 to date. The term micromort was introduced in 1979 
by Ronald Howard as a person’s risk of dying as 1 in a million. Drinking 0.5 L of wine or walking 17 miles all increase your risk of death by 1 micromort. 
Risk of death from BIA-ALCL is 0.4 micromorts for a woman having bilateral breast implants. This information is important for counseling new patients 
and those presenting with delayed onset seromas.

Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) was first described 
in 1985 when atypical tumor cells consistently demon-
strated the CD30 antigen. ALCL was added as a distinct 
entity in 1998 to the revised Kiel classification, and in 
1994 was included in the Revised European American 
Lymphoma (REAL) classification. The REAL classifica-
tion for ALCL then became the World Health Organization 
(WHO) classification in 2001.1 The first published report 
of breast implant-associated ALCL (BIA-ALCL) was by 
Keech in 1997.2 As more case reports were published, an 
increased awareness of BIA-ALCL was generated, leading 
to a proliferation of literature in an attempt to better under-
stand and classify BIA-ALCL. In 2011, the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) identified a possible association 
between breast implants and the development of ALCL but 
it wasn’t until 2016 that the WHO recognized BIA-ALCL as 
a unique type of T-cell lymphoma.3,4
The true number of global cases of BIA-ALCL continues 
to be difficult to determine. Many countries have created 
national registries to better track the diagnosis and progno-
sis of BIA-ALCL. Srinivasa et al conducted a recent review 
of 40 national and international government authority 
databases to better understand the number of BIA-ALCL 
cases reported globally. Using the US Manufacturer and 
User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database they 
identified 258 unique cases of BIA-ALCL, 130 of which 
were confirmed with appropriate pathological markers 
(CD30+ and ALK-). Of these, 110 were reported within the 
United States and 20 internationally. A total of 5 deaths 
were reportedly associated with BIA-ALCL.5 The current 
total number of known deaths related to BIA-ALCL is 12.6 
Despite ongoing research to understand the cause of BIA-
ALCL, it continues to be a rare and elusive process.

As more is learned about T-cells, more specific cellular 
characteristics have been identified including: abundant 
cytoplasm, vesicular irregular nuclei, frequent mito-
sis with the occasional “hallmark” cell being present.7 
Studies have identified changes in cellular morphology 
which are believed to be due to persistent low grade 
inflammation caused by chronic biofilm infection most 
closely linked to the bacteria Ralstonia spp.8–10 More 
recent data also suggests that BIA-ALCL actually behaves 
as a lymphoproliferative disorder in which normal cells 
experiencing chronic inflammation undergo a progressive 
and predictable transformation into “premalignant” pre-
cursors before rarely transforming into end stage malig-
nant lymphocytes.11 Evaluation of isolated cells from the 
seroma fluid of 2 patients demonstrated the presence of 
CD30+/ALK- lymphocytes which despite the expression 
of abnormal cellular markers, did not have the cellular 
features diagnostic for BIA-ALCL.12,13 This progression 
from normal to premalignant to malignant very closely 
resembles the cellular transformation seen in cutaneous 
nonmelanoma skin cancers. The clinical behavior of BIA-
ALCL is largely benign; however, surgeons have had a 
paucity of data to use for good patient education on this 
disease.
The purpose of this study is to perform a micromort risk 
analysis of BIA-ALCL and make recommendations for its 
use in breast implant patient education.
Study Data and Mathematical Analysis
It is difficult to determine the true incidence of BIA-
ALCL because there are no good estimates of the actual 
number of patients with breast implants worldwide. 
The International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery 
(ISAPS) estimated approximately 1.5 million women 
underwent breast augmentation surgery and 153,500 
women had breast implants removed in 2015 world-
wide.14 ISAPS estimates that approximately 20% of 
these women underwent breast augmentation surgery 
in the United States, or about 300,000 women. Similar 
data provided by American Society of Plastic Surgeons 
(ASPS) estimates that 290,000 women underwent 
breast augmentation surgery in 2016, with approx-
imately 30,000 removed in the same year for a net 
total of 260,000 women undergoing breast augmen-
tation in 2016.15 The American Society for Aesthetic 
Plastic Surgery (ASAPS) statistics correlate with the 
ASPS numbers in that 310,000 women underwent 
breast augmentation surgery and 43,000 women had 
implants removed in the same year.16 According to 
the ASPS trend data there was a 37% increase in the 
number of breast augmentations from 2000 to 2016, 
or about 2.3%/year. For the purposes of this analysis, 
it will be assumed that the number of patients hav-
ing implants removed follows the same trend of 2.3%/
year. Analyzing the numbers provided by both ASAPS 
and ASPS, an estimation can be made regarding the 
total number of patients undergoing breast augmen-
tation surgery going back to 1980. The data estimates 
that only 2% of women aged 55 or older have implants 
placed for breast augmentation.15
Using the more conservative data from ASPS which 
estimates 290,000 women had implants placed and 30,000 
had implants removed in 2016, for a net total of 260,000 
in the United States. Since the United States is responsi-
ble for placing 20% of implants worldwide, in 2016 there 
were 1,300,000 women who underwent breast augmenta-
tion surgery worldwide, or 2.6 million implants. With 2% 
less implants placed each year prior to 2016, there were 
1,270,000 women with implants (2,470,000 implants) 
placed in 2015, which is consistent with ISAPS data (a net 
of 1,350,000 augmentation patients for 2015, 2.7 million 
implants).14 Using this confirmed number we performed 
an annual regression back to 1980.
When summation of all years from 1980 until 2016 is 
calculated, there are currently 33,000,000 women with 
implants in place worldwide. This is still a very conserva-
tive estimate as it does not account for implants placed for 
reconstructive purposes or pre-1980 implants.
The percentage of textured implants was esti-
mated from available data. The European, Asian, and 
Australian markets use nearly 100% textured devices 
as reported from the Austrian Breast Implant Register 
which states that 97% of breast implants placed are tex-
tured devices.17 Percentages from the United States are 
more difficult to come by and can be estimated based 
off of Allergan’s and Sientra’s core studies.18,19 Based 
off of their 10-year and 9-year data respectively for all 
comers (cosmetic and reconstructive) 53.2% of patients 
had smooth implants placed while 46.8% had textured 
implants. More recent data from Sientra show that 26% 
of total implants sold in 2015 were textured, an increase 
from 8.1% in 2011.20 Prior to 2011, the US market likely 
used approximately 8% textured implants based on 
available data.
The final calculation of the total worldwide number of 
patients with implants in our analysis estimates 35 million 
patients with breast implants (roughly 70 million implants). 
To calculate the total number of textured implants world-
wide it is assumed that 97% of non-US implants are tex-
tured while 8% of those used in the United States are also 
textured. Of these 35 million patients, there are 650,000 
patients with textured implants in the United States and 
25 million patients outside of the United States, for a total 
of 26 million patients. This number does not account for 
the 2.5 million patients who have undergone breast recon-
struction in the United States with a textured device.15

A conservative global estimate is that approximately 30 
million patients have textured breast implants in place.
Micromort Concept and BIA-ALCL 
Analysis
A micromort is a unit of risk defined as a one-in-a-mil-
lion chance of death, introduced by Ronald A. Howard 
in 1979 who established the concept of decision analy-
sis.21,22 Many common daily activities have already been 
studied for micromorts per unit of exposure. Simply get-
ting out of bed when you are 20 years old increases risk 
of death by 1 micromort, driving a car 1 hour per day 
increases risk of death by 2 micromorts, and running a 
marathon increases risk of death by 8 micromorts per 
run.23 These units of risk assessment are commonly used 
for evaluation of high-risk activities such as skydiving 
and mountaineering, or even more common activities 
such as riding a bicycle for 10 miles or smoking one pack 
of cigarettes a day.
Using the estimated 30 million patients with textured 
breast implants (from above) and 12 reported deaths from 
BIA-ALCL, the risk of death from BIA-ALCL is 0.4 micro-
morts per patient (with bilateral textured implants) or 0.2 
micromorts per textured implant.
DISCUSSION
The micromort risk assessment for BIA-ALCL requires 
an accurate estimation of the number of breast implants 
currently in place worldwide. Many lecturers estimate the 
number of patients with breast implants at 5 to 10 million, 
or 10 to 20 million implants.24 Per our conservative esti-
mates, there are at least 33 million women with implants 
in place worldwide, and this only accounts for those 
patients undergoing cosmetic, not reconstructive surgery. 
If a woman was 18 when she underwent breast augmen-
tation in 1980, she would be 55 today. And because only 
2% of women older than 55 undergo breast augmenta-
tion, we only included the number of breast implants 
placed over the last 37 years. Using the same calculations 
above, there were 110,000 breast reconstructions per-
formed in the United States in 2016.15 Of these, 110,000 
breast reconstructions, 54% to 92% were prosthetic based 
reconstructions.25–27 If the number of breast reconstruc-
tions each year follows the same depreciations and global 
percentages, then there have been approximately 15 mil-
lion breast reconstructions performed worldwide over the 
last 37 years The actual number of implants worldwide 
could feasibly be 15 to 20 million higher than our esti-
mates, totaling close to 50 million, especially when taking 
into consideration those women undergoing reconstruc-
tive breast surgery.
Our calculated micromort risk for BIA-ALCL is 0.4. 
Compared to other daily activities (Table 1) which 
increased risk of death by 1 micromort (2 × BIA-ALCL 
micromort) include: drinking 0.5 liters of wine, smoking 
1.4 cigarettes, living 2 days in Boston or New York in 1979, 
drinking water in Miami for 1 year, eating 40 tablespoons of 
peanut butter, walking 17 miles, riding a bicycle 17 miles, 
traveling by car for 230 miles or by jet for 1000 miles.22,28 
Skiing 1 day in the US carries a 2× higher micromort risk 
(0.77) than the micromort risk of death from BIA-ALCL 
in a patient who had bilateral breast implants over their 
lifetime. Compared to many common daily activities, the 
micromort risk from BIA-ALCL is minimal in comparison. 
This analysis is not surprising given the observed clini-
cal course of most BIA-ALCL patients; however, this begs 
the question of why BIA-ALCL is being called what it is. 
The cumulative micromort risk from basal cell carcinoma 
(BCC) is 6.17 micromorts/year or 228 micromorts. The 
cumulative micromort risk from colon cancer is 152 micro-
morts/year or 5624 micromorts, 14,060 × the micromort 
risk BIA-ALCL.
Furthermore, current research is underway to bet-
ter understand the progression and nature of BIA-ALCL. 
Recent findings by Kadin are helping to make a strong case 
for reclassification of BIA-ALCL as a lymphoproliferative 
disorder.11 Even though specific cell markers (specifically 
CD30) are present on cells aspirated from implant associ-
ated seromas, many of these cells do not yet display the 
cellular features diagnostic for BIA-ALCL.13
The findings of this study are especially important for 
patient education. The clear lymphoproliferative nature of 
BIA-ALCL, along with the calculated risks associated with 
its diagnosis, should be used for discussion during new

consultations or at the time of presentation for evaluation 
of delayed onset seromas. Given that there has yet to be a 
documented case of BIA-ALCL with a smooth surface only 
implant, a preoperative patient who has chosen a smooth 
implant can be counselled accordingly. The risk of death 
in a woman with a smooth breast implant is essentially 
zero with our current knowledge regarding BIA-ALCL. The 
data from this analysis is relevant to patients with textured 
devices and as we learn more there will be more clarity in 
the breakdown for the varying degrees of texture, which 
may carry different risk.
Following the 2017 FDA update that did not qualify 
much of the information presented, news reports were 
published that largely provided patients with misinforma-
tion and a picture of the BIA-ALCL entity that is not real-
ity.3,29 Although there is a risk of death from BIA-ALCL, 
this risk is minimal compared to many other activities we 
perform daily. Patients can better frame the actual risk, 
which is currently skewed significantly due to the current 
classification and the lack of understanding of this rare dis-
ease. This discussion should be an integral patient of the 
patient education and informed consent process.
There are some limitations of this study due to the 
paucity of data both regarding the etiology and disease 
progression of BIA-ALCL as well as the true number of 
patients worldwide with breast implants. The estimates 
made within this paper are based on data collected from 
ASAPS, ISAPS, and ASPS annual data, and we believe 
these data are conservative and sound. Despite being 
from 3 sources with variations in the number of patients 
who underwent bilateral breast augmentation, as well as 
the number of patients who had implants removed, the 
net number of patients with breast implants each year is 
relatively consistent across all three groups. Nonetheless, 
the accuracy of these estimates cannot be completely ver-
ified. Ongoing research to help better understand the pro-
gression of BIA-ALCL will afford new insight for patient 
education.
Lastly, surgeons should also be wary in attempts to 
classify this disease as something that it obviously is not. 
The WHO should immediately amend the classification of 
BIA-ALCL as a lymphoproliferative disease solely based on 
current research and risk data, including this study which 
demonstrates an incongruity between the current classifi-
cation and the behavior of the disease.
CONCLUSION
It is important that we as educators do not react, but 
instead research and respond. When talking with patients 
about BIA-ALCL we need to use the data on hand to edu-
cate breast implant patients that BIA-ALCL is generally a 
reactive, generally benign behaving disease which is easily 
treatable with surgery.30 The cases of death which have 
occurred to date were typically in patients where they were 
not diagnosed and treated appropriately or in a timely 
fashion. When talking with patients about their risks, it is 
helpful to explain that their micromort risk from skiing for 
1 day is a 2× higher micromort risk than having a textured 
breast implant for their lifetime or that traveling 8 hours by 
car carries a 40× higher micromort risk than having two 
breast implants for their lifetime. This information should 
be yet another tool we can provide to our patients to make 
sure they are aware and informed of the true risks associ-
ated with the procedures we perform.
