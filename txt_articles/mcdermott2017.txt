OBJECTIVES To determine whether GM-CSF combined with supervised treadmill exercise
improves 6-minute walk distance, compared with exercise alone and compared with GM-CSF
alone; to determine whether GM-CSF alone improves 6-minute walk more than placebo and
whether exercise improves 6-minute walk more than an attention control intervention.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized clinical trial with 2 × 2 factorial design.
Participants were identified from the Chicago metropolitan area and randomized between
January 6, 2012, and December 22, 2016, to 1 of 4 groups: supervised exercise + GM-CSF
(exercise + GM-CSF) (n = 53), supervised exercise + placebo (exercise alone) (n = 53),
attention control + GM-CSF (GM-CSF alone) (n = 53), attention control + placebo (n = 51).
The final follow-up visit was on August 15, 2017.
INTERVENTIONS Supervised exercise consisted of treadmill exercise 3 times weekly for 6
months. The attention control consisted of weekly educational lectures by clinicians for 6
months. GM-CSF (250 μg/m2/d) or placebo were administered subcutaneously
(double-blinded) 3 times/wk for the first 2 weeks of the intervention.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was change in 6-minute walk distance
at 12-week follow-up (minimum clinically important difference, 20 m). P values were adjusted
based on the Hochberg step-up method.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with PAD, supervised treadmill exercise
significantly improved 6-minute walk distance compared with attention control + placebo,
whereas GM-CSF did not significantly improve walking performance, either when used alone
or when combined with supervised treadmill exercise. These results confirm the benefits of
exercise but do not support using GM-CSF to treat walking impairment in patients with PAD.

 P
reliminary evidence supports the hypothesis that
interventions that increase circulating endothelial
progenitor cells may improve walking performance in
patients with lower extremity peripheral artery disease
(PAD).1-6 Colony-stimulating factors mobilize progenitor cells
from bone marrow and spleen into the peripheral circulation
and may improve walking performance in people with PAD
by promoting angiogenesis and improving endothelial func-
tion and cardiovascular health. However, evidence is mixed
regarding colony-stimulating factors and improved walking
performance for people with PAD.1,7-9
In people with PAD, walking exercise induces lower
extremity ischemia and has been shown to increase circulat-
ing progenitor cells.2,10 Exercise-induced ischemia may pro-
mote homing of progenitor cells to ischemic muscle.3,5
Therefore, treadmill exercise combined with granulocyte-
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) may
enhance the effect of GM-CSF on walking performance in
people with PAD. The Progenitor Cell Release Plus Exercise
to Improve Functional Performance in PAD (PROPEL) ran-
domized trial used a 2 × 2 factorial design to determine
whether combining GM-CSF with supervised treadmill exer-
cise improved walking ability more than GM-CSF alone and
more than supervised exercise alone, respectively. This trial
also assessed whether GM-CSF was better than placebo and
whether supervised treadmill exercise was better than an
attention control intervention for improving walking perfor-
mance in PAD.
Methods
The institutional review board at Northwestern University
and all recruitment sites approved the protocol. Participants
provided written informed consent. Participants were ran-
domized between January 6, 2012, and December 22, 2016.
The final follow-up visit was on August 15, 2017. Detailed
methods are provided in the protocol in Supplement 1.
Participant Identification
Participants were identified from Chicago-area medical cen-
ters, through newspaper or radio advertisements, and from
mailings to people 55 years and older in the Chicago area.
People with PAD who previously participated in research
with the principal investigator (M.M.M.) and expressed inter-
est in future research were contacted. All data collection was
carried out by Northwestern staff, and all study interventions
were delivered at Northwestern.
Inclusion Criteria
Inclusion criteria included an ankle-brachial index (ABI) of
0.90 or less at the baseline visit.11,12 Potential participants
with an ABI greater than 0.90 at the baseline visit were
eligible, if a hospital-affiliated vascular laboratory report or
lower extremity angiogram demonstrated PAD. Participants
with an ABI of 0.90 to 1.00 at baseline and those with a nor-
mal ABI and prior lower extremity revascularization were eli-
gible if their ABI decreased by 20% after a heel-rise test.13
Heel-rise testing consisted of 50 heel rises at a rate of 1 per
second, followed by repeat ABI.13
Exclusion Criteria
Potential participants were excluded if they had a below- or
above-knee amputation; wheelchair confinement; use of a
walking aid other than a cane; inability or unwillingness to
attend exercise sessions; walking impairment for a reason
other than PAD; foot ulcer or critical limb ischemia; or sig-
nificant visual or hearing impairment. Potential partici-
pants were also excluded if they did not complete the run-in.
The run-in consisted of attending 1 weekly health education
session and 1 treadmill exercise session over a 3-week period.
Potential participants with major surgery or revasculariza-
tion during the previous 3 months or planned during the
next 6 months; current participation or participation in the
past 3 months in a clinical trial or cardiac rehabilitation;
Parkinson disease; and those requiring oxygen with activity
were excluded. Potential participants for whom exercise may
be unsafe, including those with greater than class II New York
Heart Association heart failure or angina, increase in angina
pectoris during the prior 6 months, or abnormal base-
line stress test findings, were excluded. Participants were
excluded if they were already exercising at a level similar to
the intervention. Participants treated for cancer in the past 2
years were excluded unless the cancer was early stage and
their prognosis was excellent. Those with a Mini-Mental Sta-
tus Examination score less than 23 were excluded.14
Randomization
Participants were randomized using R (R Project for Statisti-
cal Computing) to 1 of 4 groups: supervised exercise + GM-CSF
(exercise + GM-CSF), attention control + GM-CSF (GM-CSF
alone), supervised exercise + placebo (exercise alone),
or attention control + placebo. Randomization was stratified
by diabetes mellitus, since patients with diabetes have fewer
progenitor cells than those without diabetes.15 Block ran-
domization was used, with block sizes randomly selected
from 8 and 12.
Key Points
Question In people with lower extremity peripheral artery disease
(PAD), do granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(GM-CSF) and supervised treadmill exercise improve 6-minute
walk performance when the 2 interventions are combined and
when each is used alone?
Findings In a randomized clinical trial of 210 participants with
PAD, supervised treadmill exercise significantly improved the
6-minute walk by 34 m at 12-week follow-up, compared with
control. The combination of treadmill exercise with GM-CSF did
not significantly improve the 6-minute walk distance more than
exercise alone or more than GM-CSF alone, and GM-CSF alone did
not improve the 6-minute walk distance more than placebo at
12-week follow-up.
Meaning These results confirm the benefits of exercise but do not
support using GM-CSF either alone or with exercise to treat
walking impairment in PAD.

 Interventions
GM-CSF and Placebo
GM-CSF(250μg/m2/d)orplacebowasadministeredsubcutane-
ously 3 times weekly for 2 weeks, in a double-blinded fashion.
Supervised Treadmill Exercise and Attention Control
Treadmill exercise was provided 3 times weekly with an ex-
ercise physiologist. Walking exercise duration was increased
gradually until 50 minutes of exercise per session was
achieved. Participants were asked to exercise to maximal
ischemic leg symptoms.16 Participants randomized to atten-
tion control attended weekly 1-hour educational sessions by
Northwestern faculty on health topics including cancer
screening, immunizations, and hypertension.
Outcomes
Outcomes were measured before randomization and at 6
weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months after randomization by an in-
dividual blinded to group assignment.
The primary outcome was change in 6-minute walk dis-
tance between baseline and 12-week follow-up. Twelve-
week follow-up was selected for the primary outcome time
point because potential beneficial changes such as angio-
genesis may require time after GM-CSF therapy. Further-
more, prior studies of participants with PAD suggested that
benefits of GM-CSF were greater at 12-week follow-up than
at 6-month follow-up.1,9
Secondary outcomes were 12-week change in maximal
treadmill walking time and brachial artery flow–mediated di-
lation (FMD). Exploratory outcomes were change in 6-minute
walk distance, maximal treadmill walking time, and brachial
artery FMD at 6-week and 6-month follow-up and were in-
cluded to determine the temporal pattern of response to study
interventions.
Six-Minute Walk Test
Following a standardized protocol,16-19 participants walked
up and down a 100-ft (30-m) hallway for 6 minutes after
receiving instructions to cover as much distance as possible.
The distance completed after 6 minutes was recorded. A
small clinically meaningful change has been defined as 20
m and a large meaningful change as 50 m.19
Treadmill Walking Performance
Maximal treadmill walking distance was measured using the
Gardner-Skinner protocol.16,18,20
Brachial Artery FMD
FMD of the proximal brachial artery was assessed using
B-mode and Doppler ultrasound with a linear array vascular
ultrasound transducer.16 Doppler blood flow in the brachial
artery was recorded at rest and immediately after hyperemia
induction. Brachial artery diameters were recorded at rest
and then 60 and 90 seconds after cuff deflation. FMD was
defined as the ratio of the maximum brachial artery diameter
after reactive hyperemia to the resting diameter, expressed as
percent. Images were interpreted by a single reader unaware
of group assignment.16
Progenitor Cell Measures
Progenitor cells were measured in peripheral blood using stan-
dard methods.10 Detailed methods are reported as eMethods
in Supplement 2.
Ankle-Brachial Index
A handheld Doppler probe (Vascular Pocket Dop II, Nicolet
Vascular Inc) was used to measure systolic blood pressures
in the right brachial, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial
arteries and left dorsalis pedis, posterior tibial, and brachial
arteries. Measurements were repeated. The ABI was calcu-
lated by dividing mean pressures in each leg by the mean of
the 4 brachial pressures.12,21,22
Other Measures
Medical history, race, and demographics were obtained using
patient report.16,19 Collecting information on race was re-
quired by the funding agency and also allowed for assessing
thegeneralizabilityoftheresults.Anopen-endedquestionwas
used to obtain race. Height and weight were measured, and
body mass index was calculated as weight in kilograms di-
vided by height in meters squared.
Leg Symptoms
Leg symptoms were characterized using the San Diego clau-
dication questionnaire.23 Intermittent claudication was
defined as exertional calf pain that did not begin at rest,
caused the participant to stop walking, and resolved within
10 minutes of rest. Participants without intermittent claudi-
cation were either asymptomatic (ie, reported no exertional
leg symptoms) or had exertional leg symptoms that did not
meet criteria for intermittent claudication.23
Power Calculations
The trial was designed to test 4 primary hypotheses:
(1) combining GM-CSF with supervised treadmill exercise
would improve 6-minute walk distance more than GM-CSF
alone; (2) combining GM-CSF with supervised treadmill exer-
cise would improve 6-minute walk distance more than super-
vised treadmill exercise alone; (3) GM-CSF would improve
6-minute walk distance more than placebo; (4) supervised
treadmill exercise would improve 6-minute walk distance
more than an attention control intervention.
A previous randomized trial of supervised tread-
mill exercise in PAD showed that changes in 6-minute
walk distance at 6-month follow-up were +21.28 m (SD,
46.82) in the exercise group and −15.02 (SD, 55.54) in the
control group,16 representing an observed effect size of
0.69 SD. Assuming that the differences in each comparison
were all at least 0.61 SD (SD, 51 m), then 50 participants per
group provided more than 57.6% power to reject all 4
hypotheses, 75.9% power to reject 3 or more hypotheses,
96.4% power to reject 2 or more hypotheses, and 98.9%
power to reject at least 1 hypothesis. The 0.61 SD corre-
sponded to a difference of 31 m for the 6-minute walk
test, which is between the previously established values
for small (20 m) and large (50 m) minimum clinically impor-
tant differences.16,19

 Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed according to intention to
treat. Changes in 6-minute walk distance and maximal tread-
mill walking time between baseline and 12-week follow-up
were compared between groups using a 2-sample t test.
Changes in brachial artery FMD were compared using the
Wilcoxon rank sum test, since data were skewed. Statistical
testing was 2-sided.
The planned sample size was 240 participants. Investiga-
tors were recruited for as long as funding allowed, resulting
in a sample size of 210 participants. Because of the reduced
sample size, prior to any data analyses, investigators pro-
posed a new statistical analysis plan using the Hochberg
step-up method to adjust for multiple comparisons.24
This method provided more statistical power than the origi-
nally proposed Bonferroni method. Investigators and the data
and safety monitoring board were blinded to all efficacy re-
sults until after this decision was made.
In the Hochberg method, P values are sorted from
smallest to largest (P1 ≤ P2 ≤ P3 ≤ P4). In this analysis plan,
the “hypothesis” refers to the null hypothesis. Rejecting
all 4 hypotheses requires that P4 < .05. If P4 ≥ .05, the re-
maining 3 hypotheses are rejected if P3 < .05/2. If P3 ≥ .05/2,
the remaining 2 hypotheses are rejected if P2 < .05/3. If
P2 ≥ .05/3, the single remaining hypothesis is rejected
if P1 < .05/4. Hochberg-adjusted P values were also calcu-
lated as follows: adjusted P4 = P4; adjusted P3 = minimum of
(adjusted P4, 2 × P3); adjusted P2 = minimum of (adjusted P3,
3 × P2); and adjusted P1 = minimum of (adjusted P2, 4 × P1).
An adjusted Hochberg P value is statistically significant if
Hochberg-adjustedP < .05.Similarmethodswereusedforsec-
ondary and exploratory outcomes.
Analyses were performed using multiple imputation for
missing data using SAS Proc MI to obtain 20 imputed data
sets.25,26 Results were combined to account for both be-
tween- and within-imputation variability. Variables used for
imputation were age, ABI, body mass index, sex, race, smok-
ing status, baseline outcome values, leg symptoms, and co-
morbidities. People who missed follow-up testing because of
death were excluded from analyses at the time points that oc-
curred after their death.
Interaction testing was performed for the effects
of GM-CSF and exercise on study outcomes, using regres-
sion analyses. In the absence of a significant interaction,
the additive effects of GM-CSF and exercise were analyzed.
Mixed-effects regression analyses were used to compare
study outcomes longitudinally at 6-week, 12-week, and
6-month follow-up.

Results
Of 827 people evaluated, 617 were excluded and 210 were
randomized (Figure 1). One-hundred ninety-five (93%)
completed 12-week follow-up. Sixty-seven percent were
black; 39% were women. Table 1 reports characteristics
of participants.
Study drug injections were completed for 278 of 318 pos-
sible injections (87.4%) in the exercise + GM-CSF group, 294
of 318 (92.5%) in the exercise-alone group, 272 of 318 (85.5%)
in the GM-CSF–alone group, and 285 of 306 (93.1%) in the at-
tention control + placebo group. Exercise session attendance
was 2441 of 3504 sessions (69.7%) in the exercise + GM-CSF
group and 2623 of 3619 (72.5%) in the exercise-alone group.
Attendanceatattentioncontrolsessionswas863of1159(74.5%)
in the GM-CSF-alone group and 810 of 1079 (75.1%) in the at-
tention control + placebo group.
Progenitor cells increased significantly in the exercise +
GM-CSF group and in the GM-CSF–alone groups at 2-week
follow-up, but subsequently there were no statistically signifi-
cant increases in progenitor cells in any group compared with
baseline (eFigures 1 and 2 in Supplement 2).
Primary Outcomes
P values for the 4 primary comparisons, ranked from small-
est to largest, were P1 = .006, P2 = .017, P3 = .61, P4 = .91.
Using the Hochberg method to adjust for multiple compari-
sons, exercise + GM-CSF did not significantly improve
6-minute walk distance more than exercise alone (from 334.1
to 356.4 m in the exercise + GM-CSF group vs 338.7 to 367.3 m
in the exercise-alone group; mean difference, −6.3 m [95% CI,
−30.2to+17.6];P = .61;Hochberg-adjustedP = .91)ormorethan
GM-CSF alone (from 339.8 to 333.4 m in the GM-CSF–alone
group; mean difference, +28.7 [95% CI, +5.1 to +52.3]; P = .02
[unrounded value P = .0173, which was greater than the value
required for statistical significance, P < .0167]; Hochberg-
adjusted P = .052). GM-CSF alone did not improve 6-minute
walk distance more than attention control + placebo (339.1
to 334.1 m in the attention control + placebo group; mean dif-
ference, −1.4 m [95% CI, −25.2 to +22.]; P = .91; Hochberg-
adjusted P = .91) at 12-week follow-up. Exercise alone im-
proved 6-minute walk distance more than attention
control + placebo (mean difference, +33.6 m [95% CI, +9.4 to
+57.7]; P = .006; Hochberg-adjusted P = .02) at 12-week
follow-up (Table 2). Figure 2 shows changes in 6-minute walk
distances for the 4 study interventions.
Secondary Outcomes
Using the Hochberg method, at 12-week follow-up, exer-
cise + GM-CSF significantly improved maximal treadmill
walking time more than GM-CSF alone (+3.6 minutes [95%
CI, +2.1 to +5.0]; P < .001; Hochberg-adjusted P < .001)
(Table 2). Exercise + GM-CSF did not significantly im-
prove maximal treadmill walking time more than exercise
alone (Table 2). GM-CSF alone did not significantly im-
prove maximal treadmill walking time more than attention
control + placebo (Table 2). The exercise-alone intervention
significantly improved maximal treadmill walking time more
than attention control + placebo (+3.7 minutes [95% CI, +2.2
to +5.2]; P < .001; Hochberg-adjusted P < .001) (Table 2;
eFigure 3 in Supplement 2). There were no significant differ-
ences in brachial artery FMD for any prespecified comparison
(Table 2; eFigure 4 in Supplement 2). There were no changes
over time in resting brachial artery diameter or hyperemic
stimulus (see Supplement 2).

 Exploratory Outcomes
Adjusting for multiple comparisons, at 6-week follow-up the
exercise + GM-CSF intervention significantly improved maxi-
mal treadmill walking distance compared with GM-CSF alone.
Exercise + placebo significantly improved maximal tread-
mill walking distance more than attention control + placebo
(eTable 1 in Supplement 2). At 6-week follow-up, there were
no significant differences in 6-minute walk distance or bra-
chial artery FMD for any prespecified comparison (eTable 1 in
Supplement 2).
Adjusting for multiple comparisons, at 6-month follow-
up, exercise + GM-CSF significantly improved 6-minute
walk distance and maximal treadmill walking time more than
GM-CSF alone (eTable 2 in Supplement 2). Exercise alone
improved 6-minute walk and maximal treadmill walking dis-
tance, respectively, more than attention control + placebo
(eTable 2 in Supplement 2). At 6-month follow-up, there
were no other significant differences in the prespecified
comparisons.
Two participants randomized to exercise + GM-CSF died.
One died between the third and fourth study drug injections;
the death certificate listed “crack cocaine overdose” as cause
of death. The second participant collapsed while entering the
exercise facility for an exercise session during week 11 and
died within 24 hours. One participant randomized to
GM-CSF alone died of heart failure at week 14 after random-
ization. The 3 deaths were determined unlikely related to
study participation.
There was no statistically significant interaction of super-
vised exercise on the association of GM-CSF with change in
6-minute walk distance (P = .78). Therefore, data from the 2
GM-CSF groups, 2 exercise groups, and 2 placebo groups
were combined. There was no statistically significant effect
of GM-CSF on change in 6-minute walk distance at 12-week
follow-up compared with placebo (−3.8 m [95% CI, −20.6 to

 Discussion
In this trial, combining GM-CSF with supervised treadmill ex-
ercise did not significantly improve 6-minute walk distance
more than supervised exercise alone or more than GM-CSF
alone. GM-CSF alone did not significantly improve 6-minute
walk distance more than placebo. Supervised treadmill exer-
cisealonesignificantlyimproved6-minutewalkdistancemore
than attention control + placebo.
By promoting lower extremity ischemia, a stimulus for
endothelial progenitor cell release, treadmill exercise could
potentially stimulate circulating endothelial cell increases
and migration to ischemic lower extremity muscles in
patients with PAD.2,3,10 Combining ischemia-inducing tread-
mill exercise with GM-CSF had potential to enhance thera-
peutic benefits of GM-CSF. However, combining exercise
with GM-CSF was not better than exercise alone, and
GM-CSF alone did not significantly improve any outcome
more than placebo.
In contrast to results reported here, a pilot randomized
trial of 45 participants with PAD demonstrated that GM-CSF
improved treadmill walking performance and brachial artery
FMD at 12-week follow-up compared with placebo, and these
benefits were observed as early as 2 weeks after GM-CSF
injections.1 However, a subsequent randomized trial of 159
participants with PAD reported no significant improvement
in maximal treadmill walking time at 12-week follow-up

 among participants randomized to GM-CSF compared with
placebo (mean difference, 53 seconds; P = .08).9 Two of 9
secondary outcomes, the Walking Impairment Questionnaire
distance score and the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey
physical functioning score, significantly improved in the
GM-CSF group compared with placebo. There were no sig-
nificant differences in any outcomes between GM-CSF and
placebo at 6-month follow-up.9
This study had unique features. First, it combined super-
vised exercise with GM-CSF, to determine whether exercise-
induced leg ischemia enhanced the benefits of GM-CSF. Sec-
ond, the study assessed changes in walking performance at 3
time points, ranging from 6 weeks to 6 months after injec-
tion. This characteristic is important because colony-
stimulating factors increase circulating progenitor cells
immediately, but angiogenesis and other favorable systemic
changes may require more time. Third, the study included
participants with and without classic symptoms of intermit-
tent claudication. Since most people with PAD do not have
classic claudication symptoms,27 this trial is more generaliz-
able to patients with PAD encountered by practicing clini-
cians. Fourth, the study assessed changes in 6-minute walk
performance, which is more relevant to walking in daily life
than treadmill walking.17
Additional characteristics of the results should be noted.
First, supervised treadmill exercise improved treadmill walk-
ing performance as early as 6-week follow-up but had a more
gradual effect on 6-minute walk distance. This may be
because the treadmill exercise intervention specifically
trained the participant to the treadmill outcome measure.
Second, a previous study reported that supervised treadmill
exercise improved brachial artery FMD in PAD,16 but results
reported here showed no effect of exercise on FMD. The rea-
son for this discrepancy is unclear. Third, results reported
here are not consistent with those from a prior report that
treadmill exercise significantly increased circulating endo-
thelial progenitor cells in patients with PAD.2
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, the trial randomized
88% of the targeted sample size of 240 participants. Second,
a longer duration of GM-CSF therapy may have achieved
greater benefit. The 2-week therapy duration was based on a
smaller randomized trial1 in which 6 injections of GM-CSF
over 2 weeks achieved significant improvement in treadmill
walking performance at 12-week follow-up. Third, it is pos-
sible that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rather than
GM-CSF) would have been more effective.
Conclusions
Among patients with PAD, supervised treadmill exercise sig-
nificantly improved 6-minute walk distance compared with
attention control + placebo, whereas GM-CSF did not sig-
nificantly improve walking performance, either when used
alone or when combined with supervised treadmill exer-
cise. These results confirm the benefits of exercise but do
not support using GM-CSF to treat walking impairment in
patients with PAD.
