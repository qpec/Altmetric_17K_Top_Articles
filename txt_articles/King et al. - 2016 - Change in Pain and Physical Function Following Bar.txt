 DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—The Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric 
Surgery-2 is an observational cohort study at 10 US hospitals. Adults with severe obesity 
undergoing bariatric surgery were recruited between February 2005 and February 2009. Research 
assessments were conducted prior to surgery and annually thereafter. Three-year follow-up 
through October 2012 is reported.
EXPOSURES—Bariatric surgery as clinical care.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Primary outcomes were clinically meaningful 
presurgery to postsurgery improvements in pain and function using scores from the Medical 
Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) (ie, improvement of ≥5 points on the 
norm-based score [range, 0–100]) and 400-meter walk time (ie, improvement of ≥24 seconds) 
using established thresholds. The secondary outcome was clinically meaningful improvement 
using the Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (ie, improvement of ≥9.7 pain points 
and ≥9.3 function points on the transformed score [range, 0–100]).
RESULTS—Of 2458 participants, 2221 completed baseline and follow-up assessments (1743 
[78.5%] were women; median age was 47 years; median body mass index [BMI] was 45.9; 70.4% 
underwent RYGB; 25.0% underwent LAGB). At year 1, clinically meaningful improvements were 
shown in 57.6% (95% CI, 55.3%-59.9%) of participants for bodily pain, 76.5% (95% CI, 
74.6%-78.5%) for physical function, and 59.5% (95% CI, 56.4%-62.7%) for walk time. 
Additionally, among participants with severe knee or disability (633), or hip pain or disability 
(500) at baseline, approximately three-fourths experienced joint-specific improvements in knee 
pain (77.1% [95% CI, 73.5%-80.7%]) and in hip function (79.2% [95% CI, 75.3%-83.1%]). 
Between year 1 and year 3, rates of improvement significantly decreased to 48.6% (95% CI, 
46.0%-51.1%) for bodily pain and to 70.2% (95% CI, 678%-72.5%) for physical function, but 
improvement rates for walk time, knee and hip pain, and knee and hip function did not (P for all ≥.
05). Younger age, male sex, higher income, lower BMI, and fewer depressive symptoms 
presurgery; no diabetes and no venous edema with ulcerations postsurgery (either no history or 
remission); and presurgery-to-postsurgery reductions in weight and depressive symptoms were 
associated with presurgery-to-postsurgery improvements in multiple outcomes at years 1,2, and 3.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Among a cohort of participants with severe obesity 
undergoing bariatric surgery, a large percentage experienced improvement, compared with 
baseline, in pain, physical function, and walk time over 3 years, but the percentage with 
improvement in pain and physical function decreased between year 1 and year 3.
TRIAL REGISTRATION—clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00465829
Severe obesity is associated with significant joint pain and impaired physical function 
(ability to bend, lift, carry, push, and walk).1,2 Excess weight bearing can lead to joint 
damage and pain, resulting in activity restriction and walking limitations.3 Obesity can also 
contribute to pain and physical limitations through factors such as impaired 
cardiorespiratory function,4 systematic inflammation,5 reduced flexibility of movement,6 
low strength per body mass,5 and depression.7
Bariatric surgery is effective at achieving and maintaining weight loss, and inducing 
remission or reducing severity of many comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes mellitus,

 hypertension, dyslipidemia, and depression.8,9 Although evidence of improvements in pain 
and physical function following bariatric surgery is increasing, the variability and durability 
of improvement have not been well described—with most studies limited by small sample 
size and follow-up of 1 year or less or by the study of obsolete surgical procedures.10–12
This report examines pain and physical function outcomes in a large multisite cohort study 
with annual follow-up. The aim of the study was to evaluate changes in bodily and joint-
specific pain and physical function, including perceived and objectively measured walking 
capacity in the first 3 years following bariatric surgery, and to identify factors associated 
with presurgery-to-postsurgery improvements.
Methods
Participants
The Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2 (LABS-2) study is an observational 
study of 2458 adults who underwent an initial bariatric surgical procedure between March 
14, 2006, and April 24, 2009, at 1 of 10 hospitals at 6 US clinical centers.13,14 The 
institutional review boards at each center and the data coordinating center approved the 
protocol and all participants provided written informed consent.
LABS-2 had a target sample size of 2400 participants, based on anticipated loss to follow-up 
of 17% to 25% and the desire to detect small effect sizes for continuous outcomes (requires 
≤1800 participants) and odds ratios (ORs) of at least 2.0 for categorical outcomes with 90% 
power (requires ≤2000 participants) for discrete outcomes in most circumstances.
Assessments were conducted by trained personnel within 30 days prior to scheduled surgery 
and annually following surgery. To be included, participants had to complete the baseline 
and at least 1 follow-up assessment within the first 3 post-surgery years (2221 participants; 
91% with baseline data), with data collection ending October 2012 (Figure 1).
Measures
The Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) is a generic 
measure of functional health and wellbeing with proven validity, reliability, and sensitivity to 
change.15 Two domain scores were examined: bodily pain, composed of 2 items that assess 
the magnitude of bodily pain and how much it interferes with activities; and physical 
function, composed of 10 items that assess whether health limits various activities. Norm-
based methods were used to transform the scores to a mean (SD) of 50 (10) in the general 
US population.16 Higher SF-36 scores indicate less pain or better function. An increase of at 
least 5 points represents a clinically important improvement.17 The 3 items specific to 
walking limitations were also examined.
The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) measures 
symptoms of hip and knee osteoarthritis. It has demonstrated reliability and validity and is 
sensitive to preintervention-to-postintervention changes.18 This analysis used 2 scores per 
joint: pain, composed of 5 items that assess pain level during various activities; and function, 
composed of 17 items that assess difficulty performing various activities. Scores were

 transformed to a scale (0–100; lower scores indicate less pain and better function).19 A 
decrease of at least 9.7 pain points and at least 9.3 function points represents a clinically 
important improvement.20
Participants reported history of back, hip, knee, and ankle surgery; use of pain medication 
(prescription or over-the-counter) for back, hip(s), knee(s), or ankle(s), in the past week; the 
effects and level of dissatisfaction or satisfaction with back or leg pain; use of a mobility aid; 
and severe walking limitation (inability to walk 61 m unaided).13
The 400-m Long-Distance Corridor Walk (LDCW) was used to objectively measure walking 
capacity.21,22 To minimize risk, participants were instructed to walk the 400-m course at 
their usual pace and to wear a heart rate monitor. After completion, participants were asked 
if they experienced back, hip, knee, or foot pain during the LDCW. Testing could be 
terminated prior to completion for safety reasons. Participants were ineligible to attempt the 
LDCW if they had a contraindication to exertion, had any of several cardiovascular risk 
factors (eg, hospitalized for myocardial infarction, underwent angioplasty, or saw a clinician 
for new or worsening chest pain in the past 3 months), needed a mobility aid other than a 
straight cane, or reported feeling unsafe. Participants were categorized as having a mobility 
deficit if they met the LDCW exclusion criteria or stopping criteria or exceeded 7 minutes to 
walk 400 m (which equates to a cardiorespiratory fitness level of <12 mL oxygen/kg/min, 
the minimal level deemed necessary to safely cross a traffic intersection).23 A decrease of at 
least 24 seconds indicates a substantial improvement.24
Heart rate, measured after a minimum of 5 minutes of seated rest, was used as a proxy for 
cardiovascular fitness.
Primary end points were clinically meaningful presurgery-to-postsurgery improvements in 
pain and function scores from the SF-36 Health Survey and 400-m walk time. Secondary 
end points were clinically meaningful improvements in the WOMAC and remission of 
mobility deficit.
Anthropometrics, Socio demographics, and Health Indicators—Anthropometric 
measurements followed standardized protocols.8 Sociodemographics and smoking status 
were self-reported. Race was set to missing for participants who did not self-report as one or 
more of the following: white/Caucasian, black/African American, Asian, American Indian/
Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander. β-Blocker use was determined from 
the therapeutic class of self-reported prescribed medications. Diabetes and history of stroke, 
cardiovascular disease (CVD), asthma, sleep apnea, and venous edema with ulcerations were 
determined using laboratory values (eg, hemoglobin A1c), physical examination measures 
(eg, blood pressure), patient-reported medication use, comorbidity diagnoses from 
clinicians, and medical records review using standard definitions.14 Due to lack of sleep 
studies following surgery, only baseline sleep apnea status was used in this analysis. 
Depressive symptoms in the past week were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory 
(BDI) version 1.25 Higher BDI scores (range, 0–63) indicate greater depressive 
symptomatology.

 Statistical Analysis
Analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.3. Potential selection bias was examined by 
comparing preoperative characteristics and presurgery-to-postsurgery percent weight loss of 
LABS-2 participants in the analysis sample (n = 2221) to those excluded (n = 237) using the 
Pearson χ2 test for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous 
variables. Baseline characteristics were summarized with frequencies and percentages for 
categorical data and median plus interquartile (IQR) ranges for continuous data.
Longitudinal analyses was performed with mixed models (eAppendix 1 [Supplement]) using 
all available data, with control for age and site, which were associated with missing follow-
up data (eTable 1 [Supplement]). Sensitivity analyses, performed to examine the robustness 
of results with respect to the missing at random assumption, indicated that missing follow-up 
data was not related to outcomes (eAppendices 1–2, eTable 1 [Supplement]).
Evaluating Change Over Time—Mixed models were used to estimate and test changes 
in pain and physical function over time. Poisson mixed models with robust error variance 
were used for binary measures (eg, mobility deficit); mixed-effects multinomial logistic 
regression models for nominal categorical measures (eg, LDCW status); mixed-effects 
ordinal logistic regression models for ordinal measures (eg, degree to which pain interfered 
with work); and linear mixed models for continuous measures (eg, SF-36 score). Analysis of 
WOMAC scores was limited to participants with symptoms indicative of osteoarthritis 
(severe or extreme rating on ≥1 item in the relevant joint 26) at baseline. Analysis of pain 
during the LDCW excluded participants who did not start, and LDCW completion time 
excluded those who did not complete the LDCW. Analysis of heart rate excluded those who 
reported taking β-blockers. Pairwise comparisons were made between baseline and each 
follow-up and between years 1 and 3. The 4 comparisons were tested using the t statistic 
with P values adjusted to control for overall type I error (eAppendix 3 [Supplement]).27
The proportions of participants with clinically meaningful presurgery-to-postsurgery 
improvements based on SF-36 scores (among the total sample),WOMAC scores, and the 
LDCW time (among subgroups previously described) were calculated using established 
thresholds 17,20,24 with Poisson mixed models with robust error variance. An additional 12 
to 23 patients whose baseline WOMAC scores did not meet the thresholds for clinically 
important improvement were excluded. Post-surgery remission of mobility deficit (among 
patients with a presurgery mobility deficit) was also calculated. Year-1 and year-3 
proportions were compared using t statistic (eAppendix 4 [Supplement]).
Modeled percentages or means and 95% CIs, are reported. Summary statistics of observed 
data are reported online (eTables 2–3 [Supplement]).
Identifying Factors Related to Improvement—Poisson mixed models with robust 
error variance were used to identify factors related to clinically important presurgery-to-
postsurgery improvements in SF-36 and WOMAC scores, LDCW time, and remission of 
mobility deficit in years 1, 2, and 3. Sex, race, baseline age, household income, body mass 
index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), 
depressive symptoms, surgical procedure, presurgery-to-postsurgery smoking status, change

 in depressive symptoms, and percent weight change were included in all models as 
independent variables, with control for site. Baseline and presurgery-to-postsurgery change 
in bodily pain were also included as independent variables in models of physical function 
and LDCW outcomes. Baseline sleep apnea status, history of stroke, and postsurgery status 
of diabetes, asthma, venous edema with ulcerations, and CVD symptoms with consideration 
for baseline status (ie, current vs remitted/no symptoms in past 12 months, and no history) 
were also considered as independent variables and retained if statistically significant (P < .
05). Adjusted relative risks (RRs), 95% CIs, and P values are reported. All reported P values 
are 2-sided; P <.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
Results
Participant Characteristics
This report includes 2221 of 2428 study participants (91%) with baseline data (Figure 1; 
Table 1). Pain and function data were obtained in 2042 (84%) participants at year 1, 1794 
(74%) at year 2, and 1724 (72%) at year 3. Participants who were excluded (n = 237) vs 
included (n = 2221) from the analysis sample were younger (median age, 41 vs 47 years) 
and had a lower household income, a higher proportion of current smokers (22% vs 12%), 
and a lower proportion of sleep apnea (43% vs 54%) (P value for all <.05). There was also a 
significant difference in site representation between participants who were excluded vs 
included. There were no other statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics, 
or in percent of weight loss from baseline at year 1, year 2, or year 3, controlling for baseline 
characteristics that differed by group (P value for all ≥.05).
RYGB was the most common surgical procedure (70.4%); one-fourth (25.0%) of patients 
underwent LAGB; and less than 5% underwent another procedure (sleeve gastrectomy, 
banded gastric bypass, or biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch). Median (IQR) 
percentage weight loss of baseline weight at year 1 was 30.5% (21.3%-37.5%), at year 2 it 
was 30.5% (21.3%-38.5%), and at year 3 it was 28.2% (19.8%-36.4%) overall. Following 
RYGB, percentage weight loss at year 1 was 34.1% (28.7%-39.2%), at year 2 it was 34.1% 
(27.7%-40.3%), and at year 3 it was 31.5% (24.8%-8.4%). Following LAGB, percentage 
weight loss at 1 year was 14.0% (9.7%-19.7%), at year 2 it was 16.1% (9.4%-23.0%), and at 
year 3 it was 16.2% (8.1%-23.1%).
Presurgery-to-Postsurgery Change in Pain and Physical Function
Following surgery, SF-36 scores were significantly higher for bodily pain (baseline, 39.9 
[95% CI, 39.5–40.3] to 44.8 [95% CI, 44.3–45.3] at year 3) and for physical function 
(baseline, 36.5 [95% CI, 36.1–37.0] to 47.8 [95% CI, 47.4–48.3] at year 3). WOMAC scores 
were significantly lower for knee pain (baseline, 46.5 [95% CI, 44.9–48.1] to 26.2 (95% CI, 
24.1–28.2] at year 3), hip pain (baseline, 47.4 [95% CI, 45.6–49.2] to 25.7 [95% CI, 23.4–
28.0] at year 3), knee function (baseline, 48.6 [95% CI, 47.2–50.0] to 24.6 [95% CI, 22.7–
26.6] at year 3), and hip function (baseline, 46.7 [95% CI, 45.0–48.3] to 22.2 [95% CI, 
20.0–24.4] at year 3), indicating improvements in the entire sample and specifically among 
participants with severe knee or hip pain or disability at baseline (Table 2). The degree to 
which back or leg pain interfered with work and level of dissatisfaction with current back or

 leg pain symptoms also improved postsurgery (Figure 2; eTable 4 [Supplement]). Likewise, 
at follow-up, a smaller percentage of participants reported medication use for leg or back 
pain, leg or back pain during the LDCW, back or leg pain that prevented going to work or 
school, health limitations that impeded walking and mobility aid use, and were measured to 
have a mobility deficit, reflecting a higher percentage of participants able to complete the 
LDCW and faster LDCW completion time. Resting heart rate also improved (Table 2). In 
contrast, the prevalence of severe walking limitations at year 3 was not significantly different 
from baseline.
At year 1, the majority of participants had clinically meaningful presurgery-to-postsurgery 
improvements for bodily pain (57.6% [95% CI, 55.3%-59.9%]), physical function (76.5% 
[95% CI, 74.6%-78.5%]), and walk time (59.5% [95% CI, 56.4%-62.7%]). Additionally, the 
majority of participants with severe knee or hip pain or disability at baseline experienced 
joint-specific improvements (for knee pain, 77.1% [95% CI, 73.5%-80.7%]; hip pain, 74.1% 
[95% CI, 69.7%-78.4%]; hip physical function, 79.2% [95% CI, 75.3%-83.1%]), and the 
majority of participants with a mobility deficit at baseline experienced remission by year 1 
(55.6% [95% CI, 52.0%-59.3%]) (Table 3).
Durability of Improvement
Rates of improvement in LDCW time, knee and hip pain, knee and hip function, and 
mobility deficit remission did not significantly differ between year 1 and year 3 (Table 3). 
However, by year 3, rates were significantly lower vs year 1 for bodily pain (48.6% [95% 
CI, 46.0%-51.1%]) and physical function (70.2% [95% CI, 67.8%-72.5%]) (Table 3). 
Likewise, the prevalence of medication use for pain, back pain during the LDCW, health 
limitations to walking, and mobility aid use postsurgery increased during follow-up (Table 
2). Despite these postsurgery deteriorations in improvement, year-3 status was significantly 
better than baseline status.
Factors Related to Improvement in Pain, Walking Capacity, and Physical Function
Associations between sociodemographics and clinical characteristics with clinically 
meaningful improvements in bodily pain (SF-36 score), physical function (SF-36 score), 
walking capacity(LDCW completion time),and knee pain (WOMAC score) are shown in 
Table 4. Associations with additional clinically meaningful improvements in hip pain, knee 
function and hip function (WOMAC scores), and no longer having a mobility deficit are 
provided in eTable 5 (in the Supplement). Younger age, higher household income, and fewer 
depressive symptoms presurgery, greater presurgery-to-postsurgery percent weight loss, 
decline in depressive symptoms, and remission or no history of diabetes were associated 
with greater likelihood of clinically meaningful improvements in most measures of pain and 
physical function. Additionally, men, as compared with women, had greater likelihood of 
improvement in joint-specific and bodily pain, while lower BMI and less bodily pain 
presurgery, greater presurgery-to-postsurgery decline in bodily pain, and remission or no 
history of venous edema with ulcerations were associated with greater likelihood of 
improvement in multiple measures of physical function. More pain presurgery was 
associated with higher likelihood of improvement in pain, and worse function presurgery 
was associated with higher likelihood of improvement in function. Type of surgical

 procedure (RYGB, LAGB, and other) was not related to any outcomes. The numbers of 
participants with clinically meaningful improvements by year, outcome, and categorical 
variables in Table 4 and eTable 5 (Supplement) are reported in eTable 6 and eTable7 
(Supplement) .
Postsurgery Hip, Knee, Ankle, and Back Procedures
The incidence of past-year hip, knee, or ankle surgery in year 1 was 3.7% (95% CI, 
2.9%-4.6%), for year 2 it was 4.9% (95% CI, 2.9%-4.6%), and for year 3 it was 4.6% (95% 
CI, 3.6%-5.6%); the majority of which were knee surgeries (eTable 8 [Supplement]). Past-
year back surgery incidence ranged from a year-1 level of 1.5% (95% CI, 0.9%-2.0%) to a 
year-3 level of 2.3% (95% CI, 1.5%-3.1%).
Discussion
The primary findings of this study are that through 3 years of follow-up: (1) approximately 
50% to 70% of adults with severe obesity who underwent bariatric surgery experienced 
clinically significant improvements in perceived bodily pain and physical function and in 
objectively measured walking capacity; and (2) approximately three-fourths of participants 
with severe knee and hip pain or disability at baseline experienced clinically significant 
improvements in symptoms indicative of osteoarthritis. Additionally, results of this study 
suggest that, while response to surgery was variable, there were several presurgery factors 
and postsurgery changes that were consistently associated with improvements in pain and 
physical function following bariatric surgery.
Changes in SF-36 and WOMAC pain scores observed in this study indicate that following 
bariatric surgery, the majority of patients initially experience clinically meaningful 
improvements in bodily and joint-specific pain, although the percentage with improvement 
in pain and function, as measured by the SF-36, decreased from year 1 to year 3. 
Additionally, the findings that following surgery, a smaller percentage of patients had back 
or leg pain that prevented them from going to work or school and that the degree to which 
back or leg pain interfered with work improved suggest that bariatric surgery may lead to 
improvements in work productivity and related costs. However, when considering the 
clinical implications of bariatric surgery on pain, it is important to note that bariatric surgery 
patients, as a group, continue to have more pain following surgery than the general US 
population, as indicated by the mean standardized SF-36 bodily pain score.16 Additionally, 
at year 3, approximately 1 in 3 participants took pain medication within the prior week for 
back pain or leg pain and were dissatisfied with their level of back or leg pain.
This study revealed substantial improvements in joint-specific and general measures of 
function. The mean standardized SF-36 physical function score improved approximately 1 
standard deviation following surgery, such that it was close to that of the general US 
population at year 3 (48 vs 50).16 Improvements in resting heart rate and LDCW walking 
time and the related improvement (decrease) in the proportion of patients with an objectively 
defined mobility deficit are also noteworthy—as walking capacity is a strong predictor of 
incident mobility limitations and all-cause mortality. Still, at year 3, approximately one-
fourth of patients self-reported limitations with walking several blocks and exhibited

 evidence of an objectively measured mobility deficit, indicating that a sizable portion of 
postsurgery patients may have walking limitations that hinder ability to follow physical 
activity recommendations for weight loss maintenance.28
The findings from this study reinforce shorter-term results from studies that have reported 
significant improvements in SF-36 bodily pain and physical function scores,29–32 WOMAC 
scores,29,33,34 walking capacity (as measured by the LDCW or the 6-minute walk 
test),30,31,35,36 resting heart rate,35,36 or other measures of pain and function 10–12 in the first 
3 to 12 months following RYGB or LAGB. Few studies have reported on pain and function 
from longer-term follow-up of these procedures. In a cross-sectional analysis, Sanchez-
Santos et al 37 reported that a smaller percentage of adults at least 5 years after RYGB (22% 
[50]) had difficulty with mobility when compared with controls matched on presurgery 
characteristics (55%; P < .01). Likewise, Raoof et al 38 reported that mean (SD) scores for 
bodily pain and physical function on the SF-36 were better 12 (3) years post-RYGB when 
compared with those of morbidly obese controls who were awaiting surgery (matched on 
age and sex). Another study,39 which provided follow-up for 145 LAGB patients for 3 to 8 
years, reported that fewer patients had significant knee pain at follow-up vs baseline (38% vs 
47%; P < .01). The authors speculated that the majority of patients may not have 
experienced a clinical improvement because of irreversible degenerative joint damage.
In the Swedish Obesity Study, which primarily studied vertical banded gastroplasty, a 
smaller percentage of male and female surgical patients reported pain in most body parts 
(neck, back, hip, knee, and ankle) 2 years following surgery vs non-surgical controls. 
However, most comparisons were not statistically significant at 6-year follow-up, despite 
substantial (albeit smaller) differences in 6-year weight change (mean difference >20 kg in 
both men and women).40 Given that we detected deteriorations in some measures of pain 
and function between year 1 and year 3, evaluating longer-term follow-up will be important 
for elucidating the durability of surgery-induced improvements and examining how weight 
regain, which becomes common 2 or more years following RYGB and LAGB,8 and other 
factors (such as physical activity participation) may explain deteriorations.
This study identifies several baseline characteristics such as younger age, higher household 
income, fewer depressive symptoms, and no history of diabetes related to improvements in 
pain and physical function following surgery, as well as presurgery-to-postsurgery changes 
associated with improvements in pain and function. Similar to 2 previous studies, degree of 
weight loss was consistently related to improvement,29,40 while surgical procedure, 
independent of weight loss, was not. However, contrary to a previous study,29 which did not 
find an association between resolution of comorbid medical conditions and improvements in 
SF-36 or WOMAC scores 6 to 12 months following RYGB (N = 48), our data suggest that 
change in several comorbidities was associated with changes in pain and function. 
Specifically, patients who had remission of diabetes, remission of venous edema with 
ulcerations, and no symptoms of cardiovascular disease in the past 12 months had greater 
improvements in either pain, function, or both than patients who continued to have each 
condition and/or symptoms, respectively. Also, improvement in depressive symptoms was 
related to 7 of 8 outcomes. Although this association may be bidirectional, the finding that 
having fewer presurgery depressive symptoms was associated with improvements in pain

 suggests amelioration of depressive symptoms may contribute to postsurgery pain 
perception. Less bodily pain presurgery and presurgery-to-postsurgery decline in bodily pain 
were associated with improvements in physical function and walking capacity, after 
controlling for factors related to both pain and function. Thus, effective pain management 
may help postsurgical patients improve their physical function and walking capacity.
Limitations of this study include the lack of a nonsurgical control group, precluding us from 
establishing that surgery caused observed changes in pain and physical function. 
Additionally, we do not know whether knee or hip pain reflected osteoarthritis pain or 
widespread chronic pain, and we did not assess abdominal pain, which may affect perceived 
joint or bodily pain, or the number of years of obesity and severe obesity, which might affect 
likelihood of improvement. Missing follow-up data are also a concern because they can 
affect statistical power or bias the findings. However, the initial sample size and retention 
rate were adequate to ensure sufficient power for the analyses; all longitudinal analyses 
controlled for baseline factors (age and site) related to missing follow-up data; and the 
sensitivity analysis showed that those missing pain or function outcomes at 1, 2, or 3 years 
vs those not missing these data had similar improvement rates at the other follow-up time 
points, indicating the missing data have a minimal affect on the results. The current study’s 
large geographically diverse sample, inclusion of multiple validated measures of pain and 
physical function, longitudinal design, and follow-up through 3 years make it one of the 
most informative studies of pain and function following RYGB and LAGB to date.
Conclusions
Among a cohort of patients with severe obesity undergoing bariatric surgery, a large 
percentage experienced improvement compared with baseline in pain, physical function, and 
walk time over 3 years. However, the percentage with improvement in pain and physical 
function decreased between year 1 and year 3 following surgery.

aAll models were adjusted for site and age. Observed data are reported in eTable 3 (Supplement).
bImprovement in bodily pain and physical function was evaluated among the entire cohort; LDCW time improvement was evaluated among participants who were not ineligible, refused participation, or 
noncompleters at any time point; improvement in knee or hip pain and function was evaluated among those with severe pain or disability at baseline; remission of mobility deficit was evaluated among those 
with a mobility deficit at baseline.
cScores indicate improvement (increase) ≥5 points on the norm-based scores.
dScores indicate improvement (decrease) of at least 24 seconds.

aAll 4 models controlled for site. Models also controlled for surgical procedure and presurgery and postsurgery smoking status, which were forced in the models but were not significantly associated with 
any of the outcomes. Observed data are reported in eTable 6 (Supplement).
bValues indicate minimal clinically important improvement (increase of ≥5 points) on norm-based SF-36 scores.
cValues indicate substantial improvement (decrease of ≥24 seconds).
dValues indicate minimal perceptible clinical improvement (reduction of ≥9.7 pain points) on the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC).
eFor the household income category comparing $50 000 or greater vs $25 000 to less than $50 000, the ARR is 1.15 (95% CI, 1.03–1.28).
fBMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.
gThe ARR (95% CI) is not reported for variables that were not retained in the model due to lack of significance (P≥ .05 overall).
