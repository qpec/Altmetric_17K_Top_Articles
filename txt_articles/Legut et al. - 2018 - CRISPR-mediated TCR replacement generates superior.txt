Adoptive transfer of T cells genetically modified to express a cancer-specific T-cell receptor
(TCR) has shown significant therapeutic potential for both hematological and solid tumors.
However, a major issue of transducing T cells with a transgenic TCR is the preexisting
expression of TCRs in the recipient cells. These endogenous TCRs compete with the
transgenic TCR for surface expression and allow mixed dimer formation. Mixed dimers,
formed by mispairing between the endogenous and transgenic TCRs, may harbor auto-
reactive specificities. To circumvent these problems, we designed a system where the
endogenous TCR-b is knocked out from the recipient cells using clustered regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein-9 (Cas9)
technology, simultaneously with transduction with a cancer-reactive receptor of choice.
This TCR replacement strategy resulted in markedly increased surface expression of
transgenic ab and gd TCRs, which in turn translated to a stronger, and more polyfunctional,
response of engineered T cells to their target cancer cell lines. Additionally, the TCR-plus-
CRISPR–modified T cells were up to a thousandfold more sensitive to antigen than standard
TCR-transduced T cells or conventional model proxy systems used for studying TCR ac-
tivity. Finally, transduction with a pan-cancer–reactive gd TCR used in conjunction with CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of the
endogenous ab TCR resulted in more efficient redirection of CD41 and CD81 T cells against a panel of established blood
cancers and primary, patient-derived B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia blasts compared with standard TCR transfer.
Our results suggest that TCR transfer combined with genome editing could lead to new, improved generations of
cancer immunotherapies. (Blood. 2018;131(3):311-322)
Introduction
Adoptive transfer of genetically engineered T cells has become
one of the most promising avenues of cancer immunotherapy.
Numerous trials have shown objective clinical responses, and
even complete remissions, after adoptive cell transfer in patients
with cancers resistant to other therapeutic interventions.1-6 The
genetic retargeting of T cells to cancer can be achieved either by
transduction with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or a T-cell
receptor (TCR) specific for an antigen of choice. Although CAR-
based therapy has proven extremely successful in hematological
malignancies positive for CD19,7 CARs can only target surface-
expressed molecules. In contrast, use of cancer-specific TCRs
allows targeting of intracellular proteome and/or metabolome.8
Vertebrate TCRs exist as heterodimers composed of either ab
or gd TCR chains. Conventional ab TCRs recognize short anti-
genic peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) I or II molecules (by CD81 and CD41 T cells, respectively).
The targets recognized by human gd T cells tend to be pre-
dominantly proteins expressed on the cell surface in the context
of a generalized cellular stress, including malignant transformation.9
A notable exception to this rule is recognition of pyrophosphate
metabolites from the mevalonate pathway (henceforth referred
to as phosphoantigens) by the predominant peripheral blood
subset of gd T cells that express TCRs composed of the Vg9 and
Vd2 chains.10 Because there is no evidence for MHC restriction of
gd T cells, and their targets are expressed on a broad range of
cancers, gd TCRs offer an exciting potential for pan-population
immunotherapy.11
The use of a transgenic TCR in primary, patient-autologous
T cells is hampered by the presence of preexisting, endoge-
nous TCRs within these cells. Expression of TCRs at the cell
surface requires the formation of a ternary complex with the CD3
components of this receptor that constitute a limiting factor for
surface expression of the antigen-binding chains of the TCR. As a
result, successful expression of transduced TCRs at the cell
surface requires that it must successfully compete with the en-
dogenous TCR chains for CD3 association.12 In addition, there is
also potential for the formation of hybrid TCRs due to mispairing

From 
 of endogenous and transduced TCR chains (so-called mixed TCR
dimers). Thus, a transduced T cell has potential to express 4 distinct
TCRs, only 1 of which is desired. Mixed TCR dimers can also exhibit
unpredictable, and potentially dangerous, target specificities, and
have been shown to cause fatal autoimmunity.13
Several methodologies have been explored to overcome the
issue of TCR competition and mispairing. These approaches
include generation of affinity-enhanced TCRs,14 engineering
of mutations to improve the pairing of transgenic TCRs,15 or
overexpression of CD3 components.12 Affinity-enhanced TCRs
have shown high rates of objective clinical response because
even a small number of functional TCR molecules is sufficient
to convey antigen-specific signaling due to superphysiological
activity.16 However, affinity-enhanced, engineered TCRs have
bypassed the rigors of thymic selection and have the potential to
react to self-antigens. Indeed, unanticipated cross-reactivity by
an affinity-enhanced MAGE A3-specific TCR with an epitope
from titin caused fatal autoreactivity in both patients who were
treated with T cells expressing this TCR.17,18
Here, we aimed to enhance the functionality of natural TCRs
during TCR gene transfer of primary CD81 and CD41 T cells by
simultaneous knockout of the endogenous ab TCR during
transfer of a TCR of choice. This approach enhanced the ex-
pression of the transduced TCR at the T-cell surface and resulted
in TCR transductants that displayed substantially improved an-
tigen sensitivity. In particular, we focused on leveraging broadly
cancer-reactive gd TCRs in the TCR transfer system as this ap-
proach can be used irrespective of patient HLA type. T cells
transduced with this system were shown to have superior in vitro and
ex vivo reactivity to primary hematological malignancies compared
with T cells expressing both endogenous and transgenic TCRs.
Materials and methods
Cell lines and primary cultures
The following cell lines were purchased from ATCC and cultured
according to manufacturer’s recommendations: Jurkat E6.1,
Molt-3, KBM7, K562, THP-1, U266, TK6. The primary B-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cells (HP, VB, BV, K ¨
O, CM, PH)
were cultured in defined serum-free media as described pre-
viously.19,20 The B lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) 146 was gen-
erated by Epstein-Barr virus infection of peripheral mononuclear
cells21 (PBMCs) obtained from a healthy donor. Primary B cells
and T cells were isolated from PBMCs based on CD19 or CD4
expression, respectively, and used for functional assays 1 day
after isolation. The HLA-A21 melanoma cell line was cultured in
RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum,
penicillin/streptomycin, and L-glutamine (all from Gibco, Paisley,
United Kingdom). T-cell clone gd20 was generated by single-cell
cloning from PBMCs as described.22 We also made use of an ab
T-cell clone Mel13, specific for a Melan-A epitope EAAGIGILTV
presented in the context of HLA-A2.23 T-cell clones and lines
were expanded in presence of 1 mg/mL phytohemagglutinin
(PHA) and allogeneic irradiated feeders from at least 3 donors.24
Generation of transfer vectors and
lentiviral particles
A TCR from clone gd20 was sequenced in-house using the
SMARTer RACE kit (Clontech) and 2-step polymerase chain
reaction using universal forward primers and reverse primers
specific for constant regions of TCR-g and TCR-d. The gd20 TCR
was found to be composed of a Vg9 and Vd2 chain. Mel13 is a
sister clone of Mel5 and the TCR sequence has been published
before.23 We have also produced a TCR-peptide-HLA A2 co-
complex structure of this TCR with analog25 and natural26 anti-
gens. Codon-optimized, full-length TCR chains, separated by a
self-cleaving 2A sequence,27 were synthesized (Genewiz) and
cloned into the third-generation lentiviral transfer vector pELNS
(kindly provided by James Riley, University of Pennsylvania,
Philadelphia, PA). The pELNS vector contains a rat CD2 (rCD2)
marker gene separated from the TCR by another self-cleaving
2A sequence. For clustered regularly interspaced short palin-
dromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein-9 (Cas9)
mediated knockout of both TCR-b constant regions (trbc1 and
trbc2; International Immunogenetics Information System [IMGT]
Web site), 4 guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting the first exon of the
trbc gene segments were designed using, and cloned into,
pLentiCRISPR v2 plasmid28 (Addgene plasmid 52961, kindly
provided by Feng Zhang, McGovern Institute for Brain Research,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology). pLentiCRISPR v2 plasmid
encodes SpCas9 protein and a puromycin-resistance marker gene
(puromycin N-acetyltransferase [pac]). The sequence alignments of
gRNAs are summarized in supplemental Figure 1 (available on the
Blood Web site).
Lentiviral particles were generated by calcium chloride trans-
fection of HEK 293T cells. TCR transfer vectors were cotransfected
with packaging and envelope plasmids pMD2.G, pRSV-Rev, and
pMDLg/pRRE, whereas CRISPR/Cas9 vectors were cotransfected
with packaging and envelope plasmids pMD2.G and psPAX2 (all
from Addgene). Lentiviral particles were concentrated by ultra-
centrifugation prior to transduction of T cells.
T-cell transduction
PBMCs were obtained from healthy donors obtained via the
Welsh Blood Service. Primary T cells were purified by Ficoll sep-
aration followed by magnetic enrichment for either CD81 or CD41
T cells (Miltenyi Biotec). T cells were subsequently activated over-
night by incubation with CD3/CD28 beads (Dynabeads; Life
Technologies) at a 3:1 bead-to-T-cell ratio. After activation, the T cells
were transduced with lentiviral particles encoding either a TCR
only or both a TCR and CRISPR/Cas9, in the presence of 5 mg/mL
polybrene (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). T cells that had taken up
the virus were selected by incubation with 2 mg/mL puromycin (Life
Technologies) and magnetic enrichment with a-rCD2 phycoerythrin
(PE) antibody (clone OX-34, Biolegend) followed by a-PE mag-
netic beads (Miltenyi Biotec). Fourteen days posttransduction,
T cells were expanded with allogeneic feeders.22 For all functional
experiments, transduced T cells were .95% rCD21.
Flow cytometry
For surface staining, 50 000 cells were stained with Fixable Live/
Dead Violet Dye (Life Technologies) and the following anti-
bodies: rCD2 fluorescein isothiocyanate (Biolegend), pan-ab
TCR PE, pan-gd TCR allophycocyanin (APC), and CD4 PE-Vio770
and CD8 APC-Vio770 (where applicable; all obtained from
Miltenyi Biotec). Mel13-transduced cells were also stained with a
cognate tetramer (HLA-A2 refolded in-house with the EAAGI-
GILTV epitope) according to the optimized tetramer-staining
protocol.29 For characterization of the differentiation phenotype
of the transduced T cells, the following antibodies were used:

 programmed death 1 (PD-1) PE, CCR7 peridinin chlorophyll
protein–Vio770, CD45RA PE-Vio770, CD45RO fluorescein iso-
thiocyanate, and CD27 APC (all obtained from Miltenyi Biotec). All
cell lines tested were stained with BTN3 PE antibody (Biolegend),
with or without zoledronate pretreatment. For the Jurkat activation
assay, cells were incubated with antigen for 16 hours and sub-
sequently stained for CD69. For intracellular cytokine staining,
T cells were incubated for 5 hours with target cell lines, and stained
for CD107a (BD Biosciences), tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa), and
interferon g (IFNg), according to the manufacturer’s recommen-
dation (all obtained from Miltenyi Biotec). Cells were simulta-
neously stained for combinations of surface markers rCD2, CD3,
CD4, and CD8 as required. Events were acquired on FACSCanto II
(BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar).
Polyfunctionality plots were generated using SPICE software.30 A
minimum of 10 000 viable events were collected per sample.
51-Chromium release assay
For the assessment of cytotoxicity, target cells were preincubated
with Chromium-51 (Perkin Elmer) and then coincubated with T cells
at various effector-to-target (E:T) ratios for 4 hours, as described
before.29 Cell lysis was calculated according to the formula:
% lysis 5 (experimental 51Cr release 2 spontaneous 51Cr release)/
(experimental 51Cr release 2 maximum 51Cr release) 3 100%.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
Briefly, 30 000 T cells were coincubated with 90 000 target
cells for 16 hours, and the supernatant was harvested. The con-
centration of macrophage inflammatory protein 1-b (MIP1-b),
TNFa, or IFNg in supernatant was quantified using the respective
detection kit (R&D Systems), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. When indicated, target cells were preincubated with
50 mM zoledronic acid (Sigma Aldrich) for 16 hours and washed
extensively before coincubation with T cells.
Data analysis
All data were analyzed in GraphPad Prism software, unless
specified otherwise.
Results
Design and validation of simultaneous TCR
knockout and transfer (TCR replacement) system
Lentiviral transduction of primary T cells is greatly enhanced
when the cells are actively dividing in response to TCR and
costimulatory signals.31 To incorporate this enhancement and
produce a simple, time-efficient methodology that could be
applied with many existing TCR transduction systems, we acti-
vated T cells in the presence of 2 separate lentiviral populations,
1 encoding the TCR of choice as a transgene, the other CRISPR/
Cas9 targeting the endogenous (but not codon-optimized)
TCR-b constant region (trbc1 and trbc2) as described in “Ma-
terials and methods.” Four gRNAs targeting TCR-b were designed
and showed .90% knockout efficiency in the Jurkat T-cell leu-
kemia line (supplemental Figure 1A). gRNA 1 was selected for use
in primary T cells due to the high degree of mismatch between
endogenous and the standard, codon-optimized TCR-b se-
quences generally used during TCR transduction (supplemental
Figure 1B). The TCR and CRISPR lentiviruses encoded 2 different
selection markers (ectopically expressed rCD2 and puromycin
resistance gene, respectively; Figure 1A), allowing selection of cells
that had integrated the lentiviral cargo. In addition, the use of
rCD2, which was stoichiometrically expressed with the TCR,
allowed ready comparison between different donors and different
transduction conditions (TCR only or TCR plus CRISPR). Following
lentiviral transduction, transduced cells were selected by mag-
netic or fluorescence-based sorting and culturing with puromycin,
where applicable, followed by a conventional T-cell expansion
protocol (Figure 1B). Although the selection of transduced cells by
rCD2-based purification and puromycin treatment resulted in a
nearly 90% decrease in cell number (supplemental Figure 2A), the
selected cells were then capable of expanding to the same extent
as untransduced cells for at least 5 consecutive expansions with
allogeneic feeders and PHA (supplemental Figure 2B). Notably,
transduction efficiency with TCR-bearing lentivirus was decreased
in the presence of CRISPR lentivirus, indicating that a fraction of
cells were capable of accepting only 1 of the lentiviruses (sup-
plemental Figure 2C).
Transduction of primary ab T cells with a gd TCR on its own
resulted only in a minor downregulation of the endogenous ab
TCR expression. In contrast, ab TCR expression was almost
completely ablated when cells were cotransduced with TCR and
CRISPR/Cas9 in all donors tested, showing high efficiency of the
TCR replacement system (Figure 1C). We then compared the
expression of pyrophosphate metabolite–specific gd TCR (gd20),
or a melanoma antigen–specific ab TCR (Mel13), in primary
CD81 ab T cells that were either single (TCR) or double (TCR plus
CRISPR) transduced. Although the expression of transgenic
TCRs in single transduced T cells was relatively low (as detected
by pan-gd TCR antibody or a cognate Mel13 tetramer, HLA-A2:
EAAGIGILTV), cotransduction with the CRISPR vector resulted
in dramatically enhanced expression of the transduced TCR in all
donors tested (up to 10-fold increase in mean fluorescence in-
tensity, as well as a distinct shift of histogram peak; Figure 2).
A high level of expression of the transgenic ab TCR in double-
transduced cells further confirmed that TCR-b targeting gRNA
was unable to cleave the codon-optimized receptor, and that the
presence of endogenous TCRa chains did not have a detri-
mental effect on the expression of the transgenic TCR.
TCR replacement improves the functional response
of transgenic T cells to target cells
It is generally acknowledged that the number of functional TCR
molecules on the surface of a T cell is one of the factors gov-
erning T-cell sensitivity to an antigen.32 Therefore, we activated
the single- or double-transduced CD81 T cells with their target
cell lines (B-LCL line preincubated with zoledronate for gd20
TCR, and a HLA-A21 melanoma cell line for Mel13 TCR), and
measured the percentage of cells expressing a marker of cyto-
toxicity CD107a, and 2 cytokines IFNg and TNFa. The response
of TCR-plus-CRISPR–transduced T cells was markedly stronger
than that of cells transduced with only TCR (Figure 3A; sup-
plemental Figure 3). Up to 90% of TCR-plus-CRISPR–transduced
cells expressed at least 1 activation marker in response to target
cells, and most of these cells expressed all 3 markers tested for,
indicating a strong polyfunctional response to antigen. Con-
versely, ,10% and 40% of cells transduced only with gd20 and
Mel13 TCR, respectively, were capable of mounting a re-
sponse to the target cells, with only a small fraction of the cells
that did respond exhibiting .1 function. In comparison, TCR-
transduced cells with CRISPR knockout were capable of

From 
 mounting a statistically significantly stronger response to their
cognate antigen in all donors tested (Figure 3B), and the re-
sponse of TCR-plus-CRISPR cells was comparable to that of
parental clones. Both TCR only and TCR-plus-CRISPR cells
were capable of downregulating the transgenic TCR upon
stimulation with the cognate antigen (supplemental Figure 4).
Importantly, the untransduced and single/double-transduced
cells showed similar terminally differentiated effector memory
phenotype,33 plausibly resulting from CD3/CD28 bead ex-
pansion, but no signs of T-cell exhaustion, in terms of PD-1
expression34 (supplemental Figure 5).
TCR replacement improves the sensitivity to
antigen of a gd TCR by several orders of magnitude
T cells require a given copy number of antigen to be present on
target cells in order to mount a successful response, thus de-
fining the antigen sensitivity. Although antigen sensitivity may
be manipulated in the case of ab T cells by affinity maturation
of the TCR14 so that it can robustly respond to a very limited
number of antigen copies,35,36 no such technology has been
developed for gd TCRs. Therefore, we decided to investigate
whether increasing the copy number of gd TCR on transgenic
T cells by CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of endogenous TCRs would
increase the sensitivity to the cognate antigen (E)-4-hydroxy-3-
methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate (HMBPP) by TCR-transduced
cells. In parallel, we tested the model proxy system for studying
the role of TCR in target cell recognition, namely the Jurkat T-cell
leukemia line.9 We measured T-cell response to the antigen in
terms of MIP-1b secretion (for T cells) or CD69 upregulation
(Jurkat). In our experience, MIP-1b secretion has been the most
sensitive method for detecting T-cell activation.35-41 Indeed,
when we used IFNg as a readout of T-cell activation, we could
not detect any meaningful response from gd20 TCR-only
transduced T cells, whereas the activation of TCR-plus-CRISPR

sensitive to the antigen by 4 orders of magnitude (Figure 4) than

more modest than for gd20 TCR (;10-fold greater sensitivity in
terms of MIP-1b production; supplemental Figure 6B-C). Im-
portantly, the improvement observed with Mel13 TCR-plus-

HLA-A21 melanoma targets compared with cells transduced

Endogenous TCR knockout enhances recognition of
hematological malignancies via a gd TCR
Vg9Vd2 TCRs are known to recognize metabolites of the
mevalonate pathway in the context of the butyrophilin 3A1
molecule.42-44 The mevalonate pathway is often dysregulated in
cancer cells,45 and can be further modulated by aminobi-
sphosphonates
such
as
clinically
approved
zoledronate.46
Vg9Vd2 T cells and TCRs thus have the potential to target
multiple different cancer types. Therefore, we first tested the
cytotoxic activity of gd20 TCR-transduced cells against an LCL
line derived from the same donor as the parental T-cell clone.
In line with the polyfunctionality profile described in Figure 3,
TCR-plus-CRISPR–transduced CD81 cells were able to exhibit
stronger cytotoxic activity, especially at low E:T ratios (26% vs 4%
at 0.8 E:T; Figure 5A) to LCL preincubated with zoledronate. No
cytotoxicity was observed without zoledronate pretreatment,
even in the case of the parental T-cell clone, thus indicating that
the endogenous accumulation of mevalonate metabolites in that
cell line was not sufficient to trigger T-cell activation.
Because Vg9Vd2 T cells do not require CD8/CD4 coreceptors
for target recognition, we then investigated the potential of the
TCR replacement system to redirect both CD81 and CD41 T-cell
subsets to a panel of hematological malignancies. We tested the
ability of single- (gd20 only) and double-transduced (gd20 plus
CRISPR) T cells to undergo activation and cytokine secretion
(TNFa and IFNg) in response to established blood cancer cell
lines (T-cell ALL [T-ALL], acute myeloid leukemia [AML], multiple
myeloma) as well as primary, patient-derived B-ALL cells
(Figure 5B; supplemental Figure 8). The primary B-ALL cells
used here have been previously shown to closely replicate the
characteristics of the cancer without cell culture–induced
bias.19,20 Single-transduced T cells showed only low reactivity, or
no reactivity at all (especially in the case of the Molt3 T-ALL line
and primary B-ALL cells), to hematological malignancies pretreated
with zoledronate; conversely, TCR-plus-CRISPR–transduced cells
responded to all cell lines tested, in a much stronger manner than
the TCR-only transduced cells, even to cancer cells expressing
an almost undetectable level of BTN3 on the surface (supple-
mental Figure 9A). No reactivity of gd20 TCR-transduced cells
(with or without TCR-b CRISPR) was observed against freshly
isolated, zoledronate-treated healthy cells (Figure 6), despite
strong BTN3 expression on the cell surface (supplemental
Figure 9B).
Discussion
TCR gene transfer has been proven as a clinically successful
means of redirecting a patient’s immune system to combat
different cancer types.47 However, the preexistence of endog-
enous ab TCRs in the recipient T cells has limited the clinical use
to highly competitive/high-affinity ab TCRs. Here, we demon-
strate that cancer-specific ab or gd TCRs that do not compete
well with recipient TCRs, and therefore exhibit weak functional
activity, can be efficiently used to redirect recipient T cells to
cancer if combined with simultaneous knockout of endogenous
TCR-b. The resultant engineered T cells were as sensitive to
antigen as the starting T-cell clone, suggesting that mispairing

 between endogenous TCR-a chains and transduced TCR-b
must be minimal. This finding is in accordance with the results
of Provasi et al using zinc finger nucleases where transgenic
TCR activity was comparable in T cells deficient for only the
endogenous TCR-b and both TCR-a and -b.48 Furthermore,
because TCR-a and -b chains cannot pair with TCR-g and -d
chains, disruption of just the TCR-b chain is sufficient to
achieve the optimal expression of transgenic gd TCRs.

From 
 To date, there have been several reported attempts to combine
endogenous TCR knockout, using zinc finger nucleases,48,49
transcription activator-like effector nucleases,50-53 or CRISPR/
Cas9,54 with redirecting the T cells to cancer, in most cases via
CARs. This is the first report demonstrating successful redirection
of primary T cells with a pan-cancer–reactive gd TCR in com-
bination with endogenous TCR-b knockout. We showed that
removal of the endogenous TCR-b chain leads to a striking in-
crease of surface expression of transgenic ab and gd TCRs that
translates into a much stronger response of engineered T cells to
cancer lines. Although it has recently been shown by Eyquem
et al that CAR insertion into the TCR locus is beneficial due to
limiting and controlling CAR expression by physiological means,
thus preventing premature exhaustion, the antigen-binding ki-
netics and affinity of natural TCRs differ significantly from that of
CARs, and therefore a high copy number of TCRs on the cell
surface appears more desirable.55 Indeed, CRISPR-plus-TCR–
transduced T cells exhibited a significantly more polyfunctional
response profile when presented with target cells than that
observed with TCR transduction in the absence of TCR-b
knockout, without any apparent changes in terms of T-cell dif-
ferentiation and exhaustion. Importantly, Ding et al showed that
polyfunctional T cells are crucial for achieving a successful clinical
outcome in patients suffering from hematological malignancies.56
Moreover, this is the first side-by-side comparison of the an-
tigen sensitivity of the model Jurkat T-cell line, primary T cells
transduced with a given TCR and the parental T-cell clone using
the most sensitive readouts available. Our results indicate that
the antigen sensitivity of model systems used in research such
as Jurkat cells, or in the clinic (primary T cells) are up to several
orders of magnitude lower than that of the parental T-cell
clone, and that the sensitivity of the latter can be accurately
replicated by combining TCR transfer with endogenous TCR
knockout (TCR replacement) in primary T cells. Apart from

From 
 having implications for designing more effective TCR-based
immunotherapies, this result indicates that TCR replacement is
preferable to TCR transfer for functional characterizations of
TCRs of interest especially where these TCRs compete poorly
with endogenous TCRs for surface expression or have a rel-
atively low affinity for cognate antigen. This approach should
also enable detailed analysis of TCR recognition in the absence
of parental T-cell clones. Such TCRs may come from T cells
that display poor growth characteristics (eg, as a result of
cancer-mediated T-cell exhaustion57), or directly from high-
throughput sequencing of TCR repertoires.58 One can also
envisage that primary T cells transduced with a TCR of un-
known specificity but not expressing the endogenous TCRs
could be used for high-throughput, whole-genome screens28
to identify new TCR ligands, and therefore new potential
therapeutic targets.
gd T cells offer an attractive tool for cancer immunotherapy, due
to their ability to recognize ubiquitously expressed targets and
no evidence of MHC restriction. This feature allows such gd
T cells to respond to cancer from any individual and also
eliminates the risk of graft-versus-host disease.59 To date, the
majority of clinical trials utilizing gd T cells have focused on the
predominant subset in the periphery, namely Vg9Vd2 T cells,
which respond to phosphoantigen metabolites. Several multi-
center clinical trials60-63 have demonstrated that in vivo activation
of Vg9Vd2 T cells and cancer cell sensitization with aminobi-
sphosphonates (zoledronate, pamidronate) was well tolerated
and did not result in off-target toxicities (despite the ubiquitous
expression of butyrophilin molecules and mevalonate pathway
components). Encouragingly, aminobisphosphonate treatment
resulted in objective clinical responses in a fraction of patients
with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma,60 and AML,62
demonstrating the potential of gd T-cell–based immunother-
apies for hematological malignancies. However, the therapeutic
success of gd T-cell immunotherapies remains underwhelming,11
especially compared with CD19-CAR therapies.64 One of the
potential reasons for this poor success could be the use of a
variable and largely undefined (especially in terms of TCR usage)
cellular product. Furthermore, antigen-driven expansion of
Vg9Vd2 T cells, as used so far, has been shown to lead to ex-
haustion and loss of functional activity in both animal models and
in patients.65,66 In contrast, TCR replacement by gene transfer, as
used here, could be applied to a desirable T-cell subset (for
instance, T memory stem cells) thereby potentially allowing
improved host engraftment and/or function.67 We propose that
using a defined gd TCR transferred to patient’s T cells in com-
bination with the knockout of endogenous ab TCRs could be a
therapeutically beneficial strategy. Indeed, TCR-plus-CRISPR
T cells showed a markedly stronger response (in terms of
TNFa and IFNg production) than TCR-only transduced T cells to
established cancer cell lines, as well as all primary B-ALL blasts. It
should be noted that TNFa production was shown to correlate
with cancer-specific activity of cytotoxic T cells, and an elevated
intratumoral TNFa concentration could serve as a favorable
prognostic factor.68 Similarly, IFNg is a potent immunomodu-
latory cytokine that enhances T-cell–mediated recognition of
cancer cells and plays a direct anticancer role.69,70 No on-target
off-tumor reactivity of gd20 TCR-transduced cells was observed
against primary, aminobisphosphonate-treated B cells, T cells, or
whole PBMCs, in line with multiple clinical trials indicating that
aminobisphosphonate treatment (with or without infusion of ex
vivo–expanded gd T cells) was generally well tolerated without
severe adverse effects (reviewed in Legut et al11). It should be
noted, however, that even with using the TCR replacement
technology for generation of Vg9Vd2 TCR-transgenic T cells, the
patients will most likely require bisphosphonate treatment for
efficient cancer sensitization, in addition to adoptive transfer of
TCR-engineered T cells. The increasing clinical experience in
coadministering aminobisphosphonates and Vg9Vd2 T cells62,71-74
will undoubtedly facilitate designing of clinical trials testing the
efficacy of Vg9Vd2 TCR-transgenic T cells. We therefore believe
that the TCR replacement technology described here would be
of use in fundamental and translational research where it could,
for instance, be used to discover ligands of clinically relevant
TCRs. In addition, this kind of approach has potential for de-
veloping a new generation of TCR-based immunotherapies,
provided the method is optimized for the clinical scale, based on
the wealth of experience in generating therapeutic CAR T cells.
Widespread clinical application of gene-editing technology
seems imminent, as demonstrated by the recent success of the
off-the-shelf allogeneic CAR19 T cells in inducing remission of
B-ALL in infants.53 In summary, it seems likely that TCR re-
placement by CRISPR/Cas9, or other means, will generate
clinically useful T cells that do not encompass the dangers of TCR
mispairing and that can be orders of magnitude more sensitive
than the products currently being trialed.
