Abstract
Chromosomal rearrangements occur constitutionally in the general population and somatically in the majority of
cancers. Detection of balanced rearrangements, such as reciprocal translocations and inversions, is troublesome,
which is particularly detrimental in oncology where rearrangements play diagnostic and prognostic roles. Here we
describe the use of Hi-C as a tool for detection of both balanced and unbalanced chromosomal rearrangements in
primary human tumour samples, with the potential to define chromosome breakpoints to bp resolution. In addition,
we show copy number profiles can also be obtained from the same data, all at a significantly lower cost than standard
sequencing approaches.

Background
Chromosomal rearrangements are the product of erro-
neously repaired double strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA
resulting in aberrant end joining. Rearrangements can
occur via direct exchange, with no gain or loss, of
genetic material (reciprocal or balanced rearrangements)
or result in deletions or duplications (unbalanced rear-
rangements).
While
unbalanced
rearrangements
can
often be detected cytogenetically or with molecular tech-
niques, balanced rearrangements such as inversions and
reciprocal translocations, are not detectable using copy
number variation (CNV)-based methods and are often
cytogenetically cryptic, resulting in a deficit in detection.
This means that clinically relevant fusion genes and
aberrant juxtapositions of regulatory element with onco-
genes are potentially missed. New methods involving
next generation sequencing (NGS) have been developed
to attempt to overcome this detection bias but none
have been unequivocally successful when chromosome
breakpoints are not already known [1–12]. One major
drawback of using NGS methods to detect balanced re-
arrangements is the considerable sequencing depth, and
associated cost, required to differentiate real breakpoints
from
false
positives
caused
by
sequencing
errors.
Current methods perform best with at least 40x depth
[12], and even then detection can be hampered by low
mappability at repetitive regions, meaning that rear-
rangements involving centromeric, heterochromatic or
regions of high homology are often indiscernible. This is
a distinct disadvantage as many recurrent rearrange-
ments are mediated by recombination between segmen-
tal duplications or homologous sequences [13] and will
therefore have at least one breakpoint mapping within
repetitive sequences.
Here we demonstrate the power of in-nucleus Hi-C
[14], a derivative of the chromosome conformation cap-
ture (3C) technique [15], to detect both known and
novel, balanced and unbalanced chromosomal rear-
rangements from cell lines and human tumour samples.

 In addition to the detection of chromosomal abnormal-
ities, we show that copy number information can also be
obtained from the data, allowing gain, amplification and
deletion of genomic regions, as well as rearrangements,
to be detected from a single experiment. Although Hi-C
has previously been used to detect and confirm chromo-
some rearrangements in cell lines [16–18], it has not,
until now, been used on human primary tumour material
or to detect copy number information.
Results
Balanced and unbalanced translocation detection
In an attempt to detect chromosomal rearrangements
and determine accuracy of breakpoint identification we
performed in-nucleus Hi-C on two human lymphoblas-
toid cell lines with known chromosomal translocations
between chromosomes 11 and 22. FY1199 has a balanced,
constitutional translocation, 46,XY,t(11;22)(q23.3;q11.2),
and DD1618 is derived from an Emanuel Syndrome
patient (OMIM #609029) carrying an unbalanced prod-
uct of the same translocation - 47,XX,+der(22)t(11;22)
(q23.3;q11.23)mat) [19]. Hi-C interrogates spatial prox-
imity within the nucleus by analysing contacts between
genomic regions. Briefly, cells are cross-linked with for-
maldehyde to preserve spatial juxtapositioning of DNA.
The DNA is then cut with a restriction enzyme and free
sticky ends are filled in with biotinylated nucleotides
prior to religation of fragment ends that are in close
spatial proximity. Cross-links are then reversed, the
purified genomic DNA fragmented, ligation junctions
recovered on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads and
the resulting library minimally amplified for paired-end
sequencing. For any particular restriction fragment, the
vast majority of ligation events will occur with frag-
ments in the first few hundred kilobases (kb) of con-
tiguous sequence in the linear genome. The frequency
of such intrachromosomal (cis) ligation events, repre-
sented by a strong diagonal on Hi-C heatmaps, de-
creases logarithmically with genomic distance. Trans,
or interchromosomal, interactions are situated off the
diagonal and are typically present at a fraction of the
level of cis contacts [14].
When chromosomal rearrangements bring together
distal regions of the same or different chromosomes, dis-
tinct blocks of what appear to be unusually strong long-
range cis or trans interactions should be visible on the
heatmap (Fig. 1b). Hi-C heatmaps for both cell lines
showed clear blocks of strong trans ligation between
chromosomes 11 and 22. In the unbalanced Emanuel
syndrome patient, a single block was present with the
strongest contacts occurring at the known breakpoints
[20]. In contrast, the balanced translocation cell line,
FY1199, showed contacts split between two blocks that
produced a ‘butterfly’ appearance (Fig. 1c). These blocks
were joined at the point of strongest contacts, corre-
sponding to the known chromosomal breakpoints [20].
This result would be expected when the rearrangement
is reciprocal and both derivative chromosomes are
present.
Detection of novel rearrangements
To detect novel rearrangements, we performed in-
nucleus Hi-C on a transformed mouse cell line (EKLF-/-)
[21]. The heatmap showed clear single blocks of strong
contacts between sequences on chromosomes 3 and 10,
10 and 16, and X and 8 (Fig. 1d), suggesting unbalanced
translocations between these pairs of chromosomes. To
confirm
these
rearrangements,
we
performed dual-
colour DNA fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH) on
metaphase preparations using probes generated from re-
gions flanking the suspected breakpoints. All three rear-
rangements were confirmed, proving that Hi-C can
detect novel chromosomal rearrangements in cell lines,
as also demonstrated by others [16–18].
Screening of primary human brain tumours
To demonstrate the potential of Hi-C as a method to de-
tect and characterise unknown chromosomal rearrange-
ments in clinical material, we performed Hi-C on six
human brain tumours: five glioblastomas (GB) and one
anaplastic astrocytoma (AA). These were received as
fresh frozen tissue with between 75% and 90% tumour
content, as determined by the pathologist. All samples
were selected from a larger study and had full ethical ap-
proval [22]. Hi-C results revealed dramatic heterogeneity
between tumours, from no large scale structural rear-
rangements detected in one sample (GB183) to rear-
rangements involving at least 15 of the 24 different
chromosomes in another (GB176).
The heatmap from one tumour, GB180, showed the
expected strong line of cis interactions across the
diagonal and also a clear butterfly block of interactions
between chromosomes 3 and 13, with the strongest
interaction points being in genomic regions correspond-
ing to bands 3p24.1 and 13q33.3, indicating a balanced
t(3;13)(p24.1;q33.3) translocation (Fig. 2a). In addition to
this chromosomal rearrangement, there was also a dis-
tinct line of interactions from a small region of chromo-
some 7 to regions throughout the genome. This was
suggestive of amplification via double minutes – small
extrachromosomal DNA fragments that commonly con-
tain oncogenes and are spread throughout the nucleus
[23]. Sequencing reads from chromosome 7 revealed a
highly amplified 1 Mb region corresponding to the line
on the heatmap, with the read count for this region
being substantially higher than the rest of the chromo-
some. This region contained the EGFR oncogene, known
to be amplified in glioblastoma, with around 42% of
Harewood et al. Genome Biology  (2017) 18:125

 cases showing amplification of this gene via double mi-
nutes [24]. EGFR amplification was also seen in tumours
GB176 and GB182. In addition to the chromosome 7
amplification, the heatmap for tumour GB180 also
showed a similar pair of lines situated close together on
chromosome 12. These represented additional oncogene
containing regions that are amplified in glioblastoma,
with CDK4 being in one and MDM2 (murine double mi-
nute homolog 2) in the other [25, 26] (Fig. 2b).
While GB180 showed only one translocation, glio-
blastoma
GB176
was
more
complex
and
showed
evidence of multiple chromosomal rearrangements, the
majority
of
which
showed
the
butterfly
pattern
associated with balanced translocations (Fig. 3a). For
example a t(1;20)(p13.1;p12.1) translocation could be
seen, as could a t(5;15)(q32;q22.31), t(2;13)(q34;q31.1)
and t(10;19)(q25.1;q13.33). Balanced translocations could
also be seen in other tumours, such as a t(9;11)(q32;q13.2)
in GB238 and a t(X;16)(p11.22;q22.1) in AA86 (Additional
file 1: Figures S1–S4). In addition, derivative chromo-
somes generated from unbalanced translocations could be
seen in the anaplastic astrocytoma sample, AA86.
These present as single blocks of interactions, in this
case chromosomes 9;11 and 10;18, as opposed to the
butterfly
appearance
of
balanced
rearrangements
(Additional file 1: Figure S4).
Some tumour heatmaps showed chromosomes that
were involved in rearrangements with more than one
partner chromosome. As there are generally more than
one of each chromosome per cell, it may be that each is
involved in separate rearrangements—for example the
2;7 and 2;13 rearrangements in GB176 do not seem to
be associated as they share no common interaction
blocks or breakpoints. However, in cases where break-
points appear to be the same, or where interaction
blocks appear between multiple chromosomes (e.g. re-
gions of chromosomes 7, 8 and 17 all interact with
each other in GB176; see Additional file 1: Figure S5),
it is likely that complex, three-way rearrangements are
occurring. This situation could also be seen in tu-
mours GB182, GB238 and AA86 (Additional file 1:
Figures S1, S3 and S4).
Some rearrangements, such as the 6;14 and the 12;18
in GB176, appeared to be complex and involve inver-
sions at the breakpoints. In these cases, the highest
number of interactions were offset from the connecting
point of the ‘butterfly’. In addition to apparent inver-
sions, there was evidence, in the form of gaps in

 interaction blocks or a sudden drop-off in interactions,
of deletions having also occurred. For example, the 6;14
rearrangement showed a sudden drop-off in interactions
on chromosome 6q and gaps in both interaction blocks,
suggesting deletions on both derivative chromosomes
(Additional file 1: Figure S6). Similar gaps could also be
seen in the 7;17 and 8;17 rearrangements in GB176, giving
the interaction blocks a striking striped appearance.
One rearrangement in GB176, namely, the t(1;20)
(p13.1;p12.1), was examined in more detail. By selecting
the connecting points of the butterfly on the heatmap,
approximate
breakpoint
coordinates
were
surmised.

 Analysing interactions from regions just proximal/distal to
these showed expected cis interactions but also trans in-
teractions on the partner chromosome of the rearrange-
ment. At a certain point, the trans interactions dropped
off suddenly due to the remainder of that chromosome
not being involved in the translocation (Fig. 3b). This
allowed breakpoints to be determined to within one or
two HindIII fragments. In the t(1;20), the chromosome
1 breakpoint was within a single restriction fragment,
approximately 1.2 kb in size (chr1:64471372-64472588,
GRCh37), within the ROR1 gene. The chromosome 20
breakpoint was within two adjacent restriction frag-
ments (chr20:14895015-14895976 and chr20:14895977-
14903670, GRCh37), a region of approximately 8.6 kb
in size within an intron of the large MACROD2 gene.
To attempt to map the breakpoints to bp resolution,
we designed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers to
amplify the suspected breakpoint regions on chromo-
somes 1 and 20. By combining forward and reverse
primers from different chromosomes, a product could
only be obtained if the relevant derivative chromosomes
were present. Also, to confirm that the rearrangement
was tumour-specific and not constitutional, DNA from
the tumour was run alongside that from peripheral
blood of the same patient. Amplification of the normal
chromosomes could be seen in both sets of DNA but
tumour DNA also generated products for both derivative
chromosomes 1 and 20. Sequencing of the PCR fragments
identified breakpoints within intron 1 of ROR1 and intron 4
of MACROD2 (also falling within MACROD2-AS1, an
antisense RNA of the gene) and showed that, compared
with the reference sequence, a deletion of 1 bp had oc-
curred
at
the
breakpoint
on
chromosome
1
(chr1:64472097, GRCh37) and 12 bp had been deleted on
chromosome
20
(chr20:14895406-14895417,
GRCh37)
(Fig. 3c). The result of this balanced translocation is there-
fore a reciprocal fusion between the ROR1 and MACROD2
genes.
Generation of linkage score plots
To determine whether we could confirm the presence of
rearrangements using an approach other than visual in-
spection of the number of interactions on a Hi-C heat-
map, we generated linkage density plots for the Hi-C
data in a method similar to the one Burton et al. used to
validate translocations in the HeLa cell line [16]. To do
this, we split the genome into bins of approximately
500 kb and computed pairwise interaction scores among
all bins. To correct for Hi-C biases that occur due to
reads only being available within a certain distance of
HindIII restriction sites, each interaction score was nor-
malised by the number of HindIII sites contained within
that bin. This produced a linkage score for each bin to
every other bin within the genome and allowed those
bins with high linkage scores to be determined. These
high scoring bins were those situated closely in cis (as
would be expected) and also blocks of bins that had
higher scores than surrounding areas. These matched
with suspected rearrangements from the Hi-C inter-
action heatmaps and bins with the highest scores were

 situated at/near to the suspected rearrangement break-
points. All of these bins represent linkage density scores
greater than the 99th percentile of overall linkage densities
(the top 1% of values). For ease of comparison, normalised
linkage densities were plotted into genome-wide chromo-
some heatmaps, similar to those obtained from standard
Hi-C interaction data (Fig. 4 and Additional file 1: Figures
S7 and S8). In this initial study, rearrangements were deter-
mined by visual inspection of interaction heatmaps and
linkage plots, where rearrangements between chromosomes
could clearly be determined. In the linkage data, these rear-
rangements could also be seen as multiple consecutive in-
terchromosomal bins of linkage scores in the top 1% of all
values. Work is now underway to develop an algorithm to
computationally detect these rearrangements.
Tumour GB176 showed a number of regions with high
normalised linkage densities, many of which appeared
on the heatmap to have a similar ‘butterfly’ appearance
to those seen on the Hi-C interaction heatmap. Lines
showing high linkage scores could also be seen on
chromosome 7. Placing the linkage plot next to the Hi-C
interaction heatmap showed that rearrangements sus-
pected from visual inspection of Hi-C interaction heat-
maps could be confirmed computationally, via calculation
of normalised linkage matrices across the genome (Fig. 4).
Similar confirmatory results were seen for the other five
tumours (Additional file 1: Figures S7 and S8).
Copy number information
In addition to chromosome rearrangements, copy num-
ber changes are both prevalent and important in cancer.
To determine whether we could extract copy number in-
formation from the Hi-C data we had already generated,
we treated it in a manner similar to shallow whole-
genome sequencing (sWGS), though with some modifi-
cations to the Hi-C data, and processed both sets of data

 through the same copy number pipeline (QDNAseq).
QDNAseq provides copy number information from
DNA samples without the requirement for a reference
and includes steps to correct for issues caused by mapp-
ability and GC content and also blacklists a set of
genomic regions known to be problematic in copy num-
ber analyses. The output of QDNAseq is read counts per
bin, which have been corrected, filtered, normalised and
log2-transformed [27].
As mentioned above, due to the nature of Hi-C data,
only regions of the genome that are situated around
HindIII restriction sites will be captured. This introduces
a bias into sequencing data obtained via Hi-C as com-
pared to standard sWGS data. To correct for this, once
the Hi-C data had been run through the QDNAseq
pipeline, each resulting bin was divided by the number
of HindIII restriction sites that it contained, effectively
normalising for this bias.
For the six tumour samples, segmented QDNAseq
outputs (autosomes only) obtained from Hi-C and
sWGS data were compared to determine their concord-
ance. At a bin size of 100 kb, the two sets of data
showed correlation coefficient (r) values in the range of
0.93–0.99 (p < 0.01) (Table 1), with r values between
non-related samples not exceeding 0.68 (Additional
file 1: Figure S9). In order to exclude any regions that
showed consistent large changes between the two sets
of results, the difference between Hi-C and sWGS
output values was determined for each bin and the
total difference (i.e. the sum of the differences for all
six tumours) calculated. Two different thresholds of
exclusion were applied to the data – namely the
99.9th and 99.5th percentiles – with all values above
these being excluded from correlation analyses. The
99.9th percentile cutoff removed 31 of 28,822 100 kb
bins (Additional file 2: Table S1) and produced r values in
the range of 0.94–0.99 (p < 0.01) for segmented outputs
(Table 1 and Additional file 1: Figure S10). There were
155 bins above the 99.5th percentile cutoff (Additional
file 3: Table S2) and r values for segmented outputs did
not differ from above (Table 1 and Additional file 1:
Figure S11). These excluded regions do not therefore
significantly contribute to noise in the Hi-C samples
and only marginally affect the correlation between the
Hi-C and sWGS QDNAseq data. We therefore decided
to remove only the most variable regions and used the
99.9th percentile for our data (Additional file 4: Table S3).
Using the 99.9th percentile cutoff, QDNAseq results
using Hi-C data and those using sWGS were highly con-
cordant. Five of the six samples had r values of 0.97 or
higher with one sample being slightly lower (r = 0.94 in
GB183). Glioblastomas are highly heterogeneous cancers
with considerable genetic heterogeneity observed between
multiple sampling sites from within the same tumour [28].
It should be noted that while the samples taken for Hi-C
and sWGS, were obtained from the same piece of excised
tumour, they were collected from different sampling sites
leaving open the possibility that tumour heterogeneity
could explain the slightly lower correlation values in
tumour GB183.
We show that Hi-C data can be used to detect alter-
ations in copy number, without the need for a reference,
using the QDNAseq pipeline, with only slight modifica-
tions to correct for inherent Hi-C biases. Copy number
analyses of the six brain tumours using both sWGS and
Hi-C confirmed amplifications of the EGFR region on
chromosome 7 in GB176, GB180 and GB182, as sug-
gested by the Hi-C interaction data. The amplifications
of chromosome 12 in GB180 were also confirmed. Gain of
chromosome 7, a hallmark of glioblastomas [25, 26, 29],
was detected in all glioblastoma samples (those with a GB
prefix) but not the anaplastic astrocytoma, AA86. Other
known aberrations, such as loss of chromosome 10, were
also observed and deletion of the tumour suppressor gene
CDKN2A on chromosome 9p21.3, was seen in all tumours
except GB180 (Additional file 4: Table S3).
Discussion
This is the first report of Hi-C as a tool to detect both
chromosomal aberrations and copy number in primary
human tumour material. While Hi-C has previously
been used to detect and confirm rearrangements in cell
lines [16–18], it has not, until now, been used in a way
that has potential therapeutic and clinical implications.
Hi-C on these six primary tumour samples revealed am-
plifications of known oncogenes, deletions of a tumour
suppressor gene and many structural rearrangements,
both balanced and unbalanced. One balanced rearrange-
ment studied in detail was shown to result in the fusion
of
two
genes
known
to
be
involved
in
cancer
(MACROD2 [30–32] and ROR1 [33–35]).
We show that from a single Hi-C assay, information
on both chromosome rearrangements and copy number
changes can be obtained, without the requirement for
deep sequencing (see Additional file 5: Table S4). The

 large blocks of interactions seen in Hi-C heatmaps also
provide an overall picture as to what is happening with
whole chromosomes as opposed to just information
about any breakpoint regions. The ability to determine
structural and copy number aberrations along with the
‘bigger picture’ that Hi-C provides could prove a power-
ful aid in the identification and understanding of the
complex chromosomal rearrangements often seen in
cancer.
Unlike standard cytogenetic G-band preparations, Hi-
C does not rely on the presence of dividing cells and
can be used on all nucleated cell types. It is therefore a
powerful tool in the analysis of solid tumours, where
cytogenetic analysis is difficult and rarely performed as
part of routine diagnosis/analysis, yet fusion genes can
play a critical clinical role [36, 37]. Hi-C allows these
tumours to be interrogated and provides a means to
alleviate the bias in detection of both chromosomal re-
arrangements and fusion genes towards blood borne
cancers.
Although NGS sequencing is now widely being used
to screen for chromosomal rearrangements, a high
degree of sequence depth is required to enable the ex-
clusion of false positives, with efficacy of detection de-
creasing with decreasing coverage [12, 38]. In contrast
to standard sequencing approaches used to detect
balanced chromosomal rearrangements, Hi-C does not
rely on the presence of breakpoint spanning reads. The
strength that Hi-C has over other techniques is that it
uncovers large blocks of multiple interactions occurring
between one chromosome and another. This is due to
the regions either side of the breakpoint being situated
in cis and having a much higher interaction frequency
than would be expected if they were truly in trans.
These large blocks of interactions also provide an over-
all picture as to what is happening along the length of
the chromosomes involved in the rearrangements, as
opposed to just information from a small region around
the breakpoints. This enables more complex rearrange-
ments to be observed. The presence of multiple interac-
tions, instead of a small number of breakpoint spanning
reads, means that even with a relatively low number of
reads and resulting low sequence coverage (the highest
coverage in the samples outlined here was 0.55x; see
Additional file 5: Table S4), rearrangements can still be
observed. Hi-C allows the problematic detection of re-
arrangements that involve poorly mappable or repeti-
tive regions to be overcome, as surrounding regions
that can be mapped will still show the chromosomal in-
teractions indicative of a rearrangement.
Due to high sequence coverage not being required, Hi-
C costs significantly less than deep WGS. Although Hi-C
library prep costs are higher, overall Hi-C costs are still
less than one-third of those for deep (approximately 30x)
WGS (Table 2), which results in a saving of over £900 per
sample in our hands.
Conclusions
In summary:
� Hi-C can be used to detect both balanced and
unbalanced chromosome rearrangements
� The same Hi-C data can be used detect copy
number changes
� Detection of rearrangements using Hi-C does not
require deep sequencing
� Rearrangements involving poorly mappable regions
can be detected
� Hi-C provides information about whole
chromosomes involved in rearrangements, not just
the breakpoints themselves
� Hi-C does not require dividing cells and can be
used on all nucleated cell types
� Hi-C costs significantly less than deep WGS
Hi-C has the ability to play a pivotal role in the detec-
tion of novel chromosomal abnormalities, both balanced
and unbalanced, and the potential discovery of new
fusion genes. The technique requires extremely low
coverage compared with other NGS techniques being
used for this purpose and has the additional advantage
of being able to provide copy number information from
the same data. Further use of Hi-C in this way and the
generation of additional bioinformatic pipelines to ana-
lyse the data should cement the use of the technique for
the detection of chromosomal rearrangements from all
nucleated cell/tissue types and establish its role in
clinical research.

 Methods
Cell culture
The transformed mouse cell line [21] was grown in
Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM) with 10%
fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
supplemented with puromycin. Human lymphoblastoid
cell lines (FY1199 and DD1618 - European Collection of
Cell Cultures (ECACC)) were grown in RPMI-1640
medium with 10% FCS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
Hi-C on cell lines
Hi-C on cell lines was performed in nucleus as outlined
in Nagano et al. [14]. Fifty basepair paired end sequen-
cing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 1000 instru-
ment
for human samples
and 125 bp paired end
sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 was performed for
the mouse cell line. Hi-C data were filtered using the
HiCUP pipeline v0.5.8 [39] (http://www.bioinformatics.
babraham.ac.uk/projects/hicup/) and output data im-
ported into the Babraham Bioinformatics SeqMonk pro-
gram (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/
seqmonk/). Interaction heatmaps were generated using ei-
ther 1 Mb or 500 kb probes and Hi-C read count quanti-
tated using default settings. Once the heatmap was
generated, the Min Absolute count was increased to ten to
reduce background noise on the heatmaps and to enrich
for interaction blocks over single interactions. This value
could be further increased if required. Heatmaps were
coloured by the number of interactions with the colour
gradient scaled linearly from blue to red, with blue repre-
senting
the
minimum
absolute
count
specified
(see
above—ten as default for heatmaps in this manuscript) and
red denoting a fixed value of 50. Bins containing no inter-
actions or a number of interactions less than the minimum
specified are not represented on the heatmaps.
Hi-C on tumour samples
Tumours were received from Prof. V. Peter Collins
(Department of Pathology, Addenbrooke’s Hospital,
Cambridge, UK), with accompanying full ethical ap-
proval, as fresh frozen pieces consisting of between
75% and 90% tumour content, as determined by the
pathologist. Approximately 160 mg of frozen tumour
was finely chopped before being fixed and taken
through the Hi-C protocol as described above.
FISH on cell lines
Fixed cell suspensions were prepared for FISH. Colcemid
(Gibco® KaryoMAX®) was added to the culture medium
to a final concentration of 0.1 μg/mL (1 in 100) and the
flask incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were spun and
supernatant discarded. Ten millilitres prewarmed hypo-
tonic solution was added (for human: 1:1 1% (w/v) so-
dium citrate: 0.56% (w/v) (0.075 M) KCl and for mouse:
0.56% (w/v) (0.075 M) KCl only) and incubated at 37 °C
for 12 min. Cells were pelleted, the supernatant discarded
and the cells washed with and then stored (at –20 °C) in
fresh 3:1 methanol: acetic acid fix. Bacterial artificial chro-
mosomes (BACs) were obtained from BACPAC Resource
Center (BPRC) at the Children’s Hospital Oakland Re-
search Institute. Clones were grown and DNA extracted
according to BPRC protocols. BAC DNA was labelled
using ARES™ Alexa Fluor® Labelling Kits (Alexa Fluor® 488
and Alexa Fluor® 594) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. FISH was performed on fixed cell suspensions
according to standard methods [40, 41].
Breakpoint sequencing
Normal PCR was performed using standard conditions.
PCR products were purified using the Qiagen QIAquick
PCR purification kit, according to the manufacturer’s in-
structions, and the resulting products Sanger sequenced.
QDNAseq – sWGS
DNA was extracted from tumour tissue using the
Qiagen QIAamp DNA Micro Kit, according to manufac-
turer’s instructions. Sequencing libraries were then pre-
pared according to Scheinin et al. [27] and resulting
libraries sequenced (50 bp single end) on an Illumina
HiSeq 2500. The data were then run through the
QDNAseq Bioconductor package (v.1.8.0) using default
variables and a 100 kb bin size. Sex chromosomes were
not analysed.
QDNAseq – Hi-C
Hi-C paired end raw sequencing reads were truncated
through HiCUP v0.5.8. The truncated FASTQ files were
mapped to the human reference genome (GRCh37)
using bowtie2 (v2.2.8). The forward reads bam files were
merged with reverse reads bam files (using only mapped
reads from reverse reads bam file). The merged bam files
were run through the QDNAseq Bioconductor package
(v.1.8.0) and copy number identified by binning the
reads in 100 kb windows. Thereafter, Hi-C corrections
were applied on each bin for the number of HindIII re-
striction sites.
Linkage plots
Hi-C paired end raw sequencing reads were processed
through HiCUP v0.5.8 by mapping to the human refer-
ence genome (GRCh37) using bowtie2 (v2.2.8). The pair-
wise interaction matrix for each sample was computed
using 500 kb windows. Each bin of interaction matrix
was normalised by the number of HindIII restriction
sites in each bin and plotted to generate linkage density
plots.
