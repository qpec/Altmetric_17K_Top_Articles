In Brief
The inoculation of viruses into mosquito
bite sites is an important and common
stage of arbovirus infections. McKimmie
and colleagues show that inflammation at
bite sites aids viral replication and
dissemination in vivo, resulting in more
severe infection. These findings define
additional targets for post-exposure
prophylactic intervention.

SUMMARY
Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are responsible for trans-
mitting many medically important viruses such as
those that cause Zika and dengue. The inoculation
of viruses into mosquito bite sites is an important
and common stage of all mosquito-borne virus infec-
tions. We show, using Semliki Forest virus and
Bunyamwera virus, that these viruses use this inflam-
matory niche to aid their replication and dissemina-
tion in vivo. Mosquito bites were characterized by
an edema that retained virus at the inoculation site
and an inflammatory influx of neutrophils that coordi-
nated a localized innate immune program that inad-
vertently facilitated virus infection by encouraging
the entry and infection of virus-permissive myeloid
cells. Neutrophil depletion and therapeutic blockade
of inflammasome activity suppressed inflammation
and abrogated the ability of the bite to promote infec-
tion. This study identifies facets of mosquito bite
inflammation that are important determinants of the
subsequent systemic course and clinical outcome
of virus infection.
INTRODUCTION
The burden of mosquito-borne viral disease is profound. In
recent years there has been a rapid increase in both the inci-
dence and geographical range of such diseases, with spread
to more temperate climates becoming more likely. Medically
important viruses spread by arthropods (known as arboviruses)
infect hundreds of millions of people each year (Bhatt et al.,
2013; Weaver and Lecuit, 2015). This includes the chikungunya
and Zika viruses that have recently triggered large-scale epi-
demics in the Americas (Burt et al., 2012; Gatherer and Kohl,
2016). The day-biting Aedes mosquitoes, and in particular
A. aegypti, are the primary vectors. Arboviruses are an excep-
tionally large and diverse group of viruses (Elliott, 2014; Gould
and Solomon, 2008; Powers et al., 2001). This heterogeneity,
combined with the inability to accurately predict future arbovirus
epidemics, makes developing and stockpiling specific drugs and
vaccines very challenging.
All mosquito-borne viruses share a common attribute: their
site of inoculation at mosquito bite sites. This aspect of their
life cycle might provide a novel target for preventing diseases
spread by this vector. In susceptible vertebrates, arbovirus repli-
cation in tissues results in a transient but very high level of infec-
tious virus in the blood that is sufficient for a feeding arthropod to
become infected. The high-level viraemia often induces a debil-
itating febrile illness and can result in the spread of virus to other
tissues such as the brain, joints, and muscle. The early events of
arbovirus infection are important for survival of the host, with a
close relationship between early peripheral virus burden and
mortality (Ryman and Klimstra, 2008). However, there remains
a need to understand the determinants of early peripheral virus
burden and what role cutaneous innate immune responses
have in modulating viral replication and spread. It has previously
been shown that mosquito bites enhance subsequent disease
severity (Cox et al., 2012; Edwards et al., 1998; Limesand
et al., 2000; Schneider et al., 2006). A similar observation has
been made for ticks and biting flies (Dessens and Nuttall, 1998;
Peters et al., 2008). When arboviruses are transmitted by
mosquitoes, they replicate and disseminate more effectively to
the blood, which may increase both their chance of onward
transmission and their ability to cause more pronounced dis-
ease. The experimental deposition of uninfected mosquito saliva
alone, in the absence of a bite, is sufficient to mediate this effect
(Conway et al., 2014; Le Coupanec et al., 2013; Limesand et al.,
2000; Moser et al., 2015; Styer et al., 2011). Although work has
begun to define the factors within mosquito saliva that modulate
arbovirus infection, the mechanistic basis that explains these
observations is not known. Saliva from biting mosquitoes has
been shown to have potent effects on various mammalian bio-
logical processes to support successful blood feeding (Fontaine
et al., 2011), although evidence to support clearly defined
immune-modifying functions in vivo is lacking. Here, we define
the mechanistic basis by which mosquito bites enhance arbo-
virus infection in vivo.
Due to the importance of type I interferons (IFNs) and T cell re-
sponses in anti-viral immunity, their functional perturbation by
mosquito saliva during infection has often been hypothesized

 (McCracken et al., 2014; Schneider et al., 2004). However, we
showed that rather than perturb anti-viral immune responses,
mosquito bites triggered a leukocyte influx that facilitated infec-
tion by providing new cellular targets for infection. We identified a
two-step process in which mosquito bites caused an influx of in-
flammatory neutrophils that helped coordinate innate immune
responses and pave the way for the chemokine receptor
CCR2-dependent entry of myeloid cells that are permissive to
viral infection. Furthermore, mosquito bites elicited a pro-
nounced edema that retained more of the virus inoculum in the
skin and facilitated infection of these cutaneous cells. Inhibition
of key components of the inflammatory response to the bite
reduced leukocyte influx, suppressed viral replication, and
increased host survival. These findings identify an important
aspect of the host immune response to mosquito bites that inad-
vertently promotes concurrent arbovirus infection.
RESULTS
Mosquito Bites Enhance the Severity of Virus Infection
We developed an in vivo model system that makes use Semliki
Forest virus (SFV), a mosquito-borne alphavirus that is a close
relative of the chikungunya virus (Powers et al., 2001). We
used Aedes mosquito cell-produced virus for inoculations to
ensure that the first round of infection resembled the mos-
quito-transmitted virus as closely as possible. Unlike many hu-
man pathogens such as dengue and chikungunya viruses, SFV
replicates and disseminates efficiently within both immune-
competent mice and aedine mosquitoes (Ferguson et al.,
2015; Rodriguez-Andres et al., 2012). SFV4 is an avirulent strain
that rarely triggers clinical disease, whereas SFV6 is highly viru-
lent and causes a lethal encephalitis (Ferguson et al., 2015;
Michlmayr et al., 2014). After subcutaneous injection of SFV4
in the absence of mosquito bites, the virus rapidly disseminated
to the draining popliteal lymph node (dLN) within 3 to 6 hr post-
infection (hpi) (Figures S1A–S1D). A low-level viraemia peaked at
24 hpi with systemic spread to distal tissues apparent from
48 hpi onward, before occasional dissemination to the brain at
96 hpi (Figures S1A–S1C). Tissues identified by intravital imaging
as positive for virus replication were dissected and further
analyzed by quantitative (q)PCR to measure the level of viral
RNAs (Figures S1B–S1D). The absence of detectable viral repli-
cation at remote sites before 48 hpi suggested that the majority
of virus in the blood at 24 hpi was derived from cells infected at
the inoculation site and the lymphoid tissue that drains it.
To determine whether mosquito bites had the ability to affect
virus infection in this model, mice were bitten with A. aegypti
mosquitoes and then immediately infected with a defined dose
of SFV4 at the bite site in a 1 mL volume (Figures 1A and 1B).
By clearly defining the number of mosquito bites to a restricted
area of skin and by injecting a known titer of virus inoculum, it
was possible to reproducibly infect either mosquito-bitten skin
or resting unaffected skin. The presence of mosquito bites re-
sulted in an order of magnitude higher virus RNA copy number
in the skin at the inoculation site at most time points compared
to unbitten mice and in the dLN and blood from 24 hpi onward.
Virus infection with mosquito bites mediated earlier and greater
dissemination of virus to remote lymphoid tissue and to the brain
(Figure 1B) and in a significant proportion of the mice converted
an avirulent infection into a lethal one (Figure 1C). In comparison,
infection with the SFV6 strain of virus was fatal irrespective of the
presence of mosquito bites at the inoculation site. As with SFV4,
bites enhanced SFV6 infection at early time points, facilitating a
more rapid dissemination to the brain, and mice succumbed
earlier to infection (Figures 1D–1F and S1E). Mosquito bites
also significantly enhanced infection with Bunyamwera virus
(BUNV) (Figure 1G), a genetically unrelated RNA negative-sense
virus that is also transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes (Elliott, 2014).
BUNV, which otherwise struggles to replicate in wild-type mice
after extraneural inoculation (Bridgen et al., 2001), demonstrated
significantly higher replication and systemic spread to distal tis-
sues when inoculated into mosquito bites. These results indicate
that mosquito bites enhanced BUNV infection in vivo. Together
these data suggest that early skin-centric processes triggered
by mosquito bites have a substantial and defining impact on vi-
rus replication in vivo and that this impacts end-stage disease.
Mosquito Bite Sites Are Characterized by Extensive
Edema that Is Associated with Retention of Viral
Inoculum at the Bite Site
In the absence of bites, SFV disseminated rapidly to the dLN
where copy number of virus RNA correlated with type I IFN
expression in a time-dependent manner (Figure S1F). The pres-
ence of bites inhibited initial transfer of virus to the dLN (Fig-
ure 1A), which correlated with a delayed induction of gene tran-
scripts for the prototypic IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) CXCL10 and
also IFN-g (Figure S1G). However, by 24 hpi, type I IFN and ISGs
in the dLN were elevated compared to unbitten mice, correlating
with higher virus RNA copy number at this time point (Figures 1A
and S1H). To determine whether altered fluid flow within bitten
skin could account for the suppression of early viral dissemina-
tion to the dLN at 6 hr, we quantified the level of vascular leakage
at bite sites by injecting mice with Evans blue dye and measuring
the amount dye that leaked from the circulation into the bite site
(Figure 1H). At 3 hr after mosquito bite, the concentration of
Evans blue detected in bitten skin was significantly higher
compared to both resting skin and skin inflamed with the Toll-
like receptor 2 (TLR2) agonist Pam3CSK4, a known inducer of
edema (Supajatura et al., 2002). This suggested that a substan-
tial bite-associated edema occurred that was associated with
retention of virus in the skin. We hypothesized that the increased
volume of tissue fluid delayed drainage of free virus, and that its
retention was likely to facilitate infection of cutaneous cells and
could also explain the delayed innate immune activation in the

 dLN. To determine whether increased interstitial fluid alone
could account for the delayed dissemination of virus to dLN, un-
bitten mice were inoculated with the same dose of virus in either
a small volume (0.5 mL) or large volume (5 mL) inoculum of virus in
albumin-containing saline. Those mice that received the virus in
the larger volume demonstrated impaired spread of virus to the
dLN at 5 hpi, although viral RNA copy number were similar at
later time points (Figure 1I). In summary, mosquito bites induced
an edema that retained virus in the skin, facilitating infection of
cutaneous cells, but increased interstitial fluid alone is unlikely
to account for enhancement of infection by mosquito bites at
later time points.
Mosquito Bites and Virus Infection Combine to Induce a
Substantial but Transient Increase in Cutaneous
Neutrophils
To determine the mechanism by which mosquito bites enhanced
virus infection, we next defined the effect that bites alone had on
cutaneous innate immune responses. The expression of 64 key
innate immune genes were assayed in the skin of mice that
were either bitten with mosquitoes or infected with virus in the
absence of mosquito bites. Hierarchical clustering identified a
distinctive innate immune signature in bite sites that was domi-
nated by neutrophil-attracting chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL2,
CXCL3, and CXCL5) and the cytokines IL-1b and IL-6, which
were not significantly induced by virus infection alone (Figures
2A–2C and S2). Genes also upregulated by bites included the
monocytic chemoattractive chemokines CCL2, CCL4, CCL5,
CCL7, and CCL12. This expression pattern was similar in bitten
mice that had previously been exposed to multiple mosquito
bites (Figure S3). In comparison to mosquito-bitten skin, the
cutaneous gene expression signature of virus infection alone
was both markedly delayed and dominated by type I IFN and
ISGs (Figures 2A–2C and S2).
Induction of CXCL2 and IL-1b by bites was compared to other
known inducers of neutrophil influx and to virus infection alone
(Figures S4A and S4B). Despite the relatively discrete area of
skin affected by biting, compared to that affected by injection
of other innate immune stimulants, bites resulted in a substantial
increase in gene transcripts, which was further validated at the
protein level by ELISA (Figure 2D). Accordingly, mosquito bites
elicited a substantial infiltrate of neutrophils from as early as
90 min onward, as demonstrated by histology (Figure 2E), flow
cytometry analysis of Ly6GhiCD11bhiCD45+ neutrophils (Figures
2F and 2G), and qPCR analysis of neutrophil-specific markers
(Figure S4E). Despite the inability of virus infection alone to
induce substantial expression of CXCL2 or IL-1b, or Ly6Ghi
CD11bhiCD45+ neutrophil influx, infection combined with bites
induced significantly higher expression and an enhanced neutro-
phil influx compared to bite alone (Figures 2D and 2F). Thus,
although virus infection alone was not sufficient to induce the
expression of most bite-associated genes, infection did none-
theless combine with mosquito bites in the induction of bite-
associated genes and triggered a more pronounced neutrophil
influx. In summary, neutrophil influx is a key aspect of virus-
infected bite sites and that this is associated with enhanced
viral replication. One possible explanation is that newly recruited
neutrophils support viral replication by providing additional
cellular target for virus infection, as is the case for Leishmania
transmission by sandflies (Peters et al., 2008). However, we
found that neutrophils at bite sites were refractory to infection
(Figure S4F).
Mosquito Bites Do Not Subvert the Induction of Antiviral
Immune Responses
Mosquito saliva contains a myriad of biologically active compo-
nents such as vasodilators (Fontaine et al., 2011) and it has been
hypothesized that it also has immune-modulating factors that
facilitate host infection by a variety of pathogens (Schneider
et al., 2004). Indeed, much effort is being made to identify these
factors from a variety of blood-feeding arthropods (De
´ ruaz et al.,
2008; King et al., 2011). It has been suggested that mosquito
bites promote a T helper 2 (Th2)-cell-dominated immune
response that enhances virus replication (Schaeffer et al.,
2015; Schneider et al., 2004). Although our kinetic data (Figure 1)
and those of others (Styer et al., 2011) suggest that enhance-
ment of infection by mosquito bites occurs too early for adaptive
immunity in naive mice to impact on this process, we neverthe-
less looked at this possibility. Bite-associated enhancement of
infection was apparent in severe combined immunodeficiency
(SCID) mice, which lack T and B cells (Figure 3A), whereas
classic Th1 or Th2 cytokines (e.g., IFN-g, IL-4) could not be de-
tected after mosquito biting of naive wild-type mice in the
absence of virus infection (Figure S2). Prior exposure of mice
to mosquito bites primed them to rapidly express cutaneous
IFN-g and IL-10 upon further mosquito biting (Figure 3B). How-
ever, we found that these bite-experienced mice did not demon-
strate any increased susceptibility to, or protection from, bite
enhancement of SFV4 infection compared to bite-naive mice
(Figure 3C). Thus, mosquito bite enhancement of virus infection
is independent of host cutaneous IFN-g and does not require
adaptive immunity.
We next determined whether mosquito bites suppressed
cutaneous anti-viral innate immune responses. We assayed
the transcriptional induction of IFNs and ISGs known to have
important anti-viral functions (Figures 3D and 3E; Schoggins
et al., 2011). However, rather than suppress cutaneous IFN-b in-
duction to virus, mosquito bites resulted in enhanced cutaneous
IFN-b transcript induction at 24 hpi (Figure 3D), probably as a
direct result of higher virus replication as indicated by increased
virus RNA copy numbers (Figure 1). Indeed, once the higher copy
numbers of virus RNA present in the skin were accounted for,
ISG induction by virus was mostly unaffected by mosquito bites
(Figure 3E), suggesting that bites do not facilitate virus infection
by suppressing the cutaneous induction of IFNs. All together
these results indicate that mosquito bite enhancement of virus
infection is not due to suppression or subversion of skin anti-viral
immune responses by bites.

 Neutrophils Drive a Cutaneous Pro-inflammatory
Program that Inadvertently Facilitates Virus Infection
We hypothesized that if recruited neutrophils are not the target of
virus infection themselves, they might nonetheless be instru-
mental in coordinating the tissue response to mosquito bite
trauma that supports enhanced virus infection. Neutrophils
have long been established as pivotal regulators of vascular
permeability, edema, and the influx of myeloid cells (Charmoy
et al., 2010; Nakamura et al., 2009; Wedmore and Williams,
1981). Although much of the vascular leakage at bites is probably
due to vessel rupture by probing mosquitoes, neutrophils
enhance this leakage, as shown by the fact that depletion of

Fold change was calculated by comparison to resting skin and was normalized to the level of SFV E1 copy number.

 neutrophils (using the IA8 antibody that binds neutrophil-ex-
pressed Ly6G) significantly reduced edema (Figures 4A and
S5A). Depletion of neutrophils also greatly impaired the induction
of many bite-associated genes at 6 hpi (Figures 4B and 4C),
whereas in non-depleted mice, neutrophil-expressed CXCR2
copy number correlated with many of these genes (Figure 4D),
suggesting that neutrophil influx into the bite site was required
for their induction. Bite-associated genes that required neutrophil
influx included IL-1b and the monocyte-attracting chemokines
CCL2, CCL7, and CCL12 (Figure 4C). Almost all IL-1b-expressing
cells at bite sites were positive for Ly6G and CD11b by flow
cytometry, suggesting that infiltrating neutrophils themselves
were the main cellular source of this cytokine (Figures 4E–4G).
In comparison, those genes identified as specifically upregulated
by virus infection alone in Figure 2, were unaffected by neutrophil
depletion at 6 hpi (Figure 4H). In summary, inflammatory neutro-
phils that express IL-1b are required for the induction of cuta-
neous inflammatory responses to mosquito bites.
Next, we determined whether neutrophil-dependent inflamma-
tion is required for bite enhancement of infection. Depletion of
neutrophils reduced SFV4 E1 RNAs by 5-fold at both the skin
inoculation site, dLN, and distal lymphoid tissue at 24 hpi (Figures
4I and 4J), while viraemia was reduced 10-fold, such that it was
not significantly different to unbitten controls (Figure 4K). Further-
more, the early dissemination of virus to dLN observed in unbitten
mice was also partially restored in bitten mice in the absence of
neutrophils, suggesting that lymph flow had transported more
of the initial inoculum to the draining LN (Figure 4L). Thus,
mosquito bites triggered a seemingly counter-productive neutro-
phil-dependent response that enhanced SFV infection at cuta-
neous inoculation sites.
To ascertain whether this effect is specific to mosquito bites,
we determined whether innate immune agonists that also trigger
neutrophil influx could similarly enhance infection. These
included a phorbol ester (TPA), alum, and the TLR2 ligand
Pam3CSK4, all of which induced cutaneous CXCL2 and IL-1b
expression in our mice (Figures S4A and S4B). We compared
the ability of these agents to enhance SFV4 infection to that of
mosquito bites and separately to that of injected mosquito
saliva, which had been previously obtained from female
A. aegypti mosquitoes. All these agents substantially enhanced
SFV4 replication in the skin and dissemination to the blood
despite them having no known structural similarity to each other
(Figure 5A). Furthermore, as with mosquito bites, enhancement
of SFV4 infection by Pam3CSK4 and phorbol ester occurred in
a neutrophil-dependent manner (Figures 5B and 5C) and was
not due to a suppression of type I IFN induction (Figure S6).
Pam3CSK4 was also able to significantly enhance infection
with the unrelated BUNV (Figure 5D). Together this suggests
that mosquito-sourced factors at bite sites do not enhance infec-
tion via any specific evolved function, but instead by their inad-
vertent ability to promote a neutrophil-dependent inflammation
after a bite.
Therapeutic Inhibition of the Inflammasome Inhibits
Neutrophil Influx and Prevents Bite Enhancement of
Virus Infection
We next determined whether it was possible to alter the outcome
of infection by modulating host immune responses to bites.
Because neutrophil depletion was so effective at suppressing
bite enhancement of infection (Figure 4), we first determined
whether neutrophil depletion could also decrease mortality
with SFV6 infection. However, we found that neutrophils were
required for protection from SFV6 infection irrespective of the
presence of mosquito bites, with roughly 50% of neutrophil-
sufficient mice surviving infection, compared to 10% of mice sur-
viving in the absence of neutrophils (Figure S5C). Together these
data suggest that although neutrophils initiate counterproduc-
tive responses at mosquito bites for the host, they are nonethe-
less required at later stages of disease to prevent mice from
succumbing to infection.
Although the wholesale depletion of neutrophils is clearly inap-
propriate for preventing bite-enhanced SFV infection, a more
refined interventionist approach would be to reduce neutrophil
recruitment to bitten skin while leaving systemic neutrophil
numbers untouched. Because neutrophil-derived IL-1b expres-
sion was a key feature of mosquito bites and because inflamma-
some activation has been implicated in enhancing neutrophil
influx (Nakamura et al., 2009), we wanted to determine whether
it was possible to target this pathway. We first wanted to confirm
that mosquito bite enhancement of virus infection was depen-
dent specifically on IL-1b. Accordingly, Il1r1�/� mice demon-
strated both a deficiency in neutrophil recruitment to infected
bite sites and were not susceptible to bite-mediated enhance-
ment of virus infection (Figures 6A–6C), identifying this pathway
as a putative therapeutic target.
We next determined the efficacy of the well-characterized
caspase-1-specific antagonist Z-YVAD-FMK (Jabir et al., 2014)
in
preventing
bite
enhancement
of
virus
infection.
After
Z-YVAD-FMK treatment, mosquito-bitten virus-infected mice
demonstrated significantly less serum IL-1b (Figure 6D), a reduc-
tion in the cutaneous expression of bite-associated CXCL2 and
IL-6 (Figure 6E), and fewer cutaneous neutrophils (Figures 6F
and 6G). We next determined whether the innate immune sup-
pression of bite-associated inflammation provided by inflamma-
some inhibition affected the replication and dissemination of
SFV. Importantly, Z-YVAD-FMK administration had no effect
on viral titers by 24 hpi in the absence of mosquito bites (Fig-
ure 6H), suggesting that this agent has no intrinsic anti-viral ef-
fect. However, inflammasome inhibition was highly efficacious
at lowering viral titers by 24 hpi in mice infected at mosquito
bite sites (Figures 6I and 6J). Copies of SFV4 RNA in the brain
at day 5 were low or undetectable in treated mice, whereas
treated SFV6-infected mice had an increased survival rate (Fig-
ures 6K and 6L). Together, these observations show that the
IL-1b pathway promoted mosquito bite inflammation, that this
was necessary for the effective replication and dissemination
of virus from the bite site, and that these in turn determine the
subsequent systemic course of infection and clinical outcome
in the mouse.
CCR2-Dependent Migration and Infection of Myeloid
Cells Is Required for Mosquito Bite Enhancement of
Infection
Finally, we wanted to determine the mechanism by which inflam-

 endothelial cells and CD45+F4/80+CD11b+ macrophages in the
skin, which can be differentiated from each other based on their
morphology (Schledzewski et al., 2006) and by flow cytometry
(Figure S7). After infection with enhanced green fluorescent pro-
tein (EGFP)-expressing SFV, we found large numbers of EGFP+
Lyve1+ cells in the dermis (Figure 7A). Lymphatic endothelial
cells did not express EGFP (data not shown), although Lyve1+
macrophages were positive for SFV-EGFP at 6 hpi (Figures 7A
and 7B). Between 4 and 16 hpi, large numbers of CD11b+Ly6C+
Ly6G� myeloid cells infiltrated bite sites and numbers of these
cells were increased in virus-infected bite sites, whereas in the
absence of bites, virus infection alone elicited little influx of these
cells (Figure 7C). A subset of these cells were positive for virally
encoded EGFP (Figures 7D and 7E). We found that by 24 hpi in
virus-infected bite sites, there was a selective loss of Lyve1+
F4/80+CD11b+ cells, whereas numbers did not decrease in
bite sites in the absence of virus, suggesting that they had
been depleted after infection with this often cytolytic virus (Fig-
ures 7F and S7B).
Infection of myeloid cells and dendritic cells in skin has also
been reported during infection with dengue virus in the absence
of mosquito bites (Pham et al., 2012; Schaeffer et al., 2015;
Schmid and Harris, 2014), suggesting that several arboviruses
might have evolved to take advantage of the myeloid cell infil-
trate at bite sites to enhance replication. To determine whether
infection of myeloid cells at bite sites results in the release of

 new infectious virus, we isolated cutaneous cells at 16 hpi,
magnetically purified CD11b+ cells on columns (Figures 7G
and S7C), and quantified the amount of virus released after
6 hr in culture by plaque assay (Figure 7H). On a per-cell basis,
the CD11b� fraction released little new infectious virus and the
CD11b+ enriched fraction released substantially more, demon-
strating that CD11b+ cells are capable of releasing high amounts
of infectious virus.
To determine the contribution that myeloid cell-derived virus
makes toward viral replication and dissemination in vivo, we
made use of mice that lack the chemokine receptor CCR2. These
mice are monocytopenic and are deficient in all dermal bone
marrow-derived macrophages (Serbina and Pamer, 2006; Ta-
moutounour et al., 2013). Compared to WT mice, infection of
Ccr2�/� mice at bite sites resulted in similar increases in innate
immune gene expression and neutrophil influx and demon-
strated similar virus titers at 4 hpi but failed to elicit an influx of
myeloid CD11b+Ly6Chi cells (Figures 7I, 7J, S7D, and S7E).
Ccr2�/� mice were protected from bite enhancement of
SFV replication (Figure 7K). Mosquito bites also significantly
enhanced infection with BUNV in a CCR2-dependent manner
(Figure 7L). Ccr2�/� mice were not intrinsically less susceptible
to infection because in the absence of bites, SFV and BUNV ti-
ters were similar to WT mice at 24 hpi (Figures 7K and 7L).
Together this demonstrates that the inability of Ccr2�/� mice to
elicit a myeloid cell influx into bite sites prevented enhancement
of infection. In summary, we show that mosquito bites enhance
mosquito-borne virus infection by promoting the recruitment and
infection of bone marrow-derived myeloid cells that release new
infectious virus and in doing so enhance the replication and
dissemination of virus to the blood and remote tissues.
DISCUSSION
The interface between mammals and mosquitoes at bite sites is
an important and common stage of all arbovirus infections. This
crucial aspect of arbovirus transmission is a bottleneck that can
limit dissemination of virus to the bloodstream and the develop-
ment of clinically apparent disease. Although mosquito saliva is
well described as a potent enhancer of infection for several
evolutionary distinct and medically important arboviruses, the
cellular and molecular events that are responsible were not
well defined. Previously, it had been suggested that mosquito
saliva might modulate host immunity to create an immunosup-
pressed niche, as has been shown for biting ticks that suppress
chemokine function (De
´ ruaz et al., 2008). Ticks have evolved a
unique repertoire of immunosuppressive factors, which most
likely reflects their necessity to remain embedded in mammalian
skin for many days. In comparison, mosquitoes feed only tran-
siently and host immune responses are unlikely to exert sufficient
effect on feeding efficiency to drive the evolution of vector-
derived immunomodulatory factors. Instead we show that
mosquito bite enhancement of virus infection results from
virus replication in myeloid cells recruited to mosquito bites
by a neutrophil-driven inflammasome-dependent, edematous
inflammation. Whether the recruitment to bite sites of these cells
is serendipity for the virus or whether the virus has evolved to
replicate in these cells is not clear. However, the consequences
are profound and affect the subsequent systemic course and
clinical outcome of the infection. That this phenomenon occurs
with two genetically distinct arboviruses from separate families
suggests that it might also occur with many other mosquito-
transmitted viruses.
We found that the neutrophil influx to mosquito bites was
essential for coordinating the tissue response to this insult,
without which innate immune gene expression was severely cur-
tailed. This is somewhat similar to host responses to Leishmania
infection, in which neutrophil recruitment is necessary for driving
chemokine CCL3-dependent influx of dendritic cells to the skin
(Charmoy et al., 2010). Separately, although we cannot discount
the possibility that putative Th2-cell-driven allergic responses to
bites in mosquito-experienced BALB/c mice (Schneider et al.,
2007) might also a have role in potentiating virus infection, the
ability of bites to fully potentiate virus infection in SCID mice sug-
gests that they are dispensable in our model system.
Therapeutic blockade of caspase-1 and neutrophil depletion
successfully suppressed cutaneous innate immune responses
to bites and thus prevented virus from gaining a replicative
advantage. Speculatively, suppressing specific aspects of the
host response to mosquito bites might prove efficacious in pre-
venting the onset of disease. We suggest a strategy that mini-
mizes mosquito biting (e.g., use of repellents) combined with
post-exposure prophylaxis at bite sites as an effective strategy
for limiting mosquito-borne virus infection, especially for infec-
tions transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes that preferentially bite
during the day. As a corollary, our data also suggest that ap-
proaches that aim to prevent natural arbovirus infection through
vaccination to mosquito salivary components, while having
much potential, should be carefully designed not to enhance
cutaneous inflammation, and might explain why some vaccines
to saliva can worsen outcome (Reagan et al., 2012). Our findings
also have implications for the development of new ‘‘naturalized’’
models of virus infection that make use of mosquito saliva
enhancement. Many viruses, including important human patho-
gens such as chikungunya virus (Teo et al., 2012), dengue virus
(Zompi and Harris, 2012), and bunyaviruses (Bridgen et al.,
2001), struggle to replicate and disseminate within wild-type
mice after infection by needle into resting skin. Accordingly,

 immunosuppressed mice are often used as an alternative, which
precludes the experimental study of many aspects of host im-
mune responses to these infections. Building on the work of
other important studies (Conway et al., 2014; Cox et al., 2012;
McCracken et al., 2014; Moser et al., 2015; Schneider et al.,
2006; Styer et al., 2011), we suggest that the inclusion of mos-
quito bites, or their saliva, might sufficiently enhance viral repli-
cation to enable the study of these infections in wild-type mice.
In conclusion, we highlight an important aspect of host innate
immunity at mosquito bite sites. These findings not only define
the mosquito bite site as a putative target for post-exposure pro-
phylactic intervention, but also pave the way for the develop-
ment of in vivo models that better recapitulate an important
aspect of mosquito-borne virus infection.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Detailed methodology is described in the Supplemental Information.
Cell Culture, Viruses, and Mice
Aedes mosquito cells and BHK cells were cultured using established protocols
(Rodriguez-Andres et al., 2012). Details of reporter viruses can be obtained
from the authors. The pCMV-SFV4 backbone for production of SFV4 has
been previously described (Rodriguez-Andres et al., 2012; Ulper et al.,
2008). Plasmids containing cDNAs of SFV were electroporated into BHK cells
to generate infectious virus and then passaged once in mosquito cells. Titra-
tion of virus stocks and quantification of viraemia in vivo were performed via
plaque assays (Rodriguez-Andres et al., 2012). Wild-type BUNV was gener-
ated as previously described (Bridgen et al., 2001). All mice were maintained
under specific-pathogen-free conditions at the Central Research Facility, Uni-
versity of Glasgow. All mice were housed in accordance with local and Home
Office regulations.
Mosquito Biting of Mice and Virus Infection
Anesthetized mice were positioned to expose a defined area of the left foot to a
cage of A. aegypti mosquitoes. The remainder of the mouse body surface was
protected. Mice were monitored during mosquito biting and a maximum of five
mosquitos were allowed to engorge from the area exposed. Allowing more
than one mosquito to probe/bite the available skin surface ensured that
most of the exposed skin surface was subjected to probing/bites. Immediately
after completion of mosquito biting, the bitten skin was injected with 1 mL of
virus using a Hamilton Syringe (Hamilton). This approach enabled the effect
of bites on concurrent virus infection to be quantifiably compared to virus
infection alone in the absence of a bite.
RNA Extraction, Gene Expression Analysis, Flow Cytometery, and
Immunohistochemistry
RNA was extracted using PureLink Plus columns and converted to cDNA using
the High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit (Life Technologies). qPCR analysis was
undertaken using SYBR-green PerfeCTa (Quanta) and TLDAs were used as
per manufacturer’s instructions on a 7900HT Real time machine (Applied Bio-
systems). ELISAs were undertaken using Duoset kits (R&D Systems). For flow
cytometry, skin was enzymatically digested to release cells and stained using a
subset of antibodies. Cells were stained with Fixable Viability Dye eFluor780
(eBioscience), fixed in 4% methanol-free paraformaldehyde (Thermo Scienti-
fic) or Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD), and analyzed on a MACSQuant Analyzer 10 (Mil-
tenyi). For cell sorting, cells were labeled with CD11b beads and sorted on
magnetized columns (Miltenyi). For immunohistochemistry, skin was fixed
before freezing in embedding medium and sectioned. Sections were blocked
in Tris-Saline-Tween (TBS)/5% fish gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich) incubated with a
primary antibody against Lyve-1 and the secondary chicken anti-goat IgG
Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated antibody (Life Technologies).
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed using the non-parametric-based tests Mann-Whitney
or Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparison. All column plots
show the median value ± interquartile range with *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001, ns = not significant. Wherever possible, preliminary
experiments were performed to determine requirements for sample size, tak-
ing into account the available resources and ethical use of animals. Animals
(gender and age matched) were assigned randomly to experimental groups.
For plaque assays, samples were coded and analyzed blind by a separate
investigator. All results shown are representative of either two or three exper-
iments and where possible incorporate a variety of techniques and ap-
proaches. Importantly, biological replicates were excluded from analysis if
s.c. or i.d. injection of virus inadvertently punctured a blood vessel.
