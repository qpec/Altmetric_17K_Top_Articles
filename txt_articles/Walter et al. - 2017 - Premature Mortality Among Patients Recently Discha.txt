IMPORTANCE Nationwide cohorts provide sufficient statistical power for examining
premature, cause-specific mortality in patients recently discharged from inpatient psychiatric
services.
OBJECTIVE To investigate premature mortality in a nationwide cohort of patients recently
discharged from inpatient psychiatric treatment at ages 15 to 44 years.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This single-cohort design included all persons born in
Denmark (N = 1 683 385) between January 1, 1967, and December 31, 1996. Exactly 48 599 of
these Danish residents were discharged from an inpatient psychiatric unit or ward on or after
their 15th birthday, which took place during this study’
s observation period from January 1,
1982, through December 31, 2011. This group of patients was followed up beginning on their
15th birthday until their death, emigration, or December 31, 2011, whichever came first.
Individuals discharged from inpatient psychiatric care at least once before their 15th birthday
(n = 5882) were excluded from the study. All data were obtained from the Danish Civil
Registration System, Psychiatric Central Research Register, and Register of Causes of Death.
Data analysis took place between February 1, 2016, and December 10, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incidence rates and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for all-cause
mortality and for an array of unnatural and natural causes of death among patients recently
discharged from an inpatient psychiatric unit vs persons not admitted to a psychiatric facility.
Primary analysis considered risk within the year of first discharge.
RESULTS Of the 48 599 discharged patients who were included in the study, 25 006 (51.4%)
were female, 35 660 (73.4%) were aged 15 to 29 years, and 33 995 (70.0%) had a length of
stay of 30 days or less. Compared with persons not admitted, patients discharged had an
elevated risk for all-cause mortality within 1 year (IRR, 16.2; 95% CI, 14.5-18.0). The relative
risk for unnatural death (IRR, 25.0; 95% CI, 22.0-28.4) was much higher than for natural
death (IRR, 8.6; 95% CI, 7.0-10.7). The highest IRR found was for suicide at 66.9 (95% CI,
56.4-79.4), followed by alcohol-related death at 42.0 (95% CI, 26.6-66.1). Among the
psychiatric diagnostic categories assessed, psychoactive substance abuse conferred the
highest risk for all-cause mortality (IRR, 24.8; 95% CI, 21.0-29.4). Across the array of
cause-specific outcomes examined, risk of premature death during the first year after
discharge was markedly higher than the risk of death beyond the first year of discharge.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Clinicians may help protect patients after discharge by
serving as a liaison between primary and secondary health services to ensure they are
receiving holistic care. Early intervention programs for drug and alcohol misuse could
substantially decrease the greatly elevated mortality risk among these patients.

M
ental disorders are associated with an elevated risk
of premature mortality.1-3 The inpatient psychiatric
capacity in Western countries has been shrinking
for several decades,4-7 shifting mental health treatment to
community and other institutional settings.8 Consequently,
patients with psychiatric care needs are, generally, the most
severely ill and have a markedly elevated risk of dying
prematurely.9 Evidence from national registry studies indi-
cates that this mortality risk is especially high soon after dis-
charge from inpatient psychiatric services.10,11 Previous study
populations have differed in country and regional settings,
study designs, mortality outcomes assessed, and types of in-
dividuals examined. Whereas some studies used national reg-
istry data that included large numbers of discharged
patients,10-13 other investigations were based on data from a
single hospital or a small sample of units.14-16
This investigation, conducted on a national cohort of per-
sons aged 15 to 44 years, focused on the first year after dis-
charge (short-term follow-up) instead of beyond the first year
afterdischarge(long-termfollow-up).13,15Furthermore,incon-
trast to previous research,11,14 this study considered a broad
array of psychiatric diagnostic categories, including sub-
stanceabusedisorders.Toidentifycause-specificmortalityrisk
among recently discharged inpatients, we assessed the fol-
lowing outcomes:
1. All-cause mortality
2. All unnatural and all natural deaths
3. Suicides and unintentional deaths
4. Specific natural causes
5. Alcohol-related deaths
Examination of alcohol-related deaths was an especially
novel feature of the investigation. Consistent with existing lit-
erature, we hypothesized mortality risk to be highest during
the period soon after discharge.10,16 To maximize clinical rel-
evance, we primarily considered risk within the first year of
discharge. To better understand and contextualize short-
term risk, however, we examined mortality beyond the first
year—to a maximum of 30 years. In addition, we hypoth-
esized elevated risk across the full range of cause-specific mor-
tality, and we anticipated the relative risk for unnatural death
to be greater than that for natural death.11-13,16
Methods
Study Cohort Description
Information for this study was obtained from the Danish Civil
Registration System, which has captured vital status informa-
tion on all Danish residents since 1968 and can be linked with
other national registers in Denmark using personal identifi-
cation numbers issued at birth or on immigration.17 At the in-
dividuallevel,welinkedtheCivilRegistrationSystemdatawith
information from the Psychiatric Central Research Register18
and the Register of Causes of Death.19 For further informa-
tion regarding the study data, see eAppendix 1 in the Supple-
ment. In accordance with Denmark’
s Act on Processing of Per-
sonal Data, anonymity and confidentiality were strictly
maintained—for example, by replacing personal identifica-
tion numbers with randomly generated identifiers. This study
was approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency, and data
access was granted by the State Serum Institute and Statistics
Denmark. Because this investigation used only registry data,
it did not need approval from the Danish National Committee
onHealthResearchEthics.Patientinformedconsentisnotnec-
essary because registry information is routinely collected, and
Danish legislation allows the use of this information for re-
search purposes.
Cohort members (N = 1 683 385) were born in Denmark be-
tween January 1, 1967, and December 31, 1996; were alive and
residing in the country on their 15th birthday; and had par-
ents who were also Danish-born to eliminate the potential for
confounding because of elevated psychopathology risk among
immigrants.20 Persons discharged from inpatient psychiatric
care at least once before their 15th birthday (n = 5882) were
excluded. Follow-up of cohort members commenced on their
15th birthday and was terminated on their death, emigration,
or December 31, 2011, whichever came first. Within this single-
cohortdesign,weidentifiedindividualswhoexperiencedtheir
first discharge from an inpatient psychiatric unit or a psychi-
atric ward in a general hospital during the study observation
period from January 1, 1982, through December 31, 2011. We
compared this exposure group with the remaining members
of the cohort who had not experienced psychiatric admission
(the reference group) (eAppendix 2 [which describes the fic-
titious person depicted in the eFigure] in the Supplement).
Outcomes
Using the Danish Register of Causes of Death, we classified the
underlying causes of death according to the International
Classification of Diseases, Eighth Revision (ICD-8)21 and Tenth
Revision (ICD-10)22 codes:
• Unnatural death: ICD-8 E800-E999 and ICD-10 V01-Y98
• Natural death: all other ICD-8 and ICD-10 codes
• Accidental death: ICD-8 E800-E949 and ICD-10 V01-X59 and
Y85-Y86
• Suicide: ICD-8 E950-E959 and ICD-10 X60-X84 and Y87.0
• Unnatural death of undetermined intent: ICD-8 E980-E989
(excluding E988.8) and ICD-10 Y10-Y34 (excluding Y33.9)
and Y87.2
Key Points
Question How does the risk of dying prematurely among people
recently discharged from psychiatric inpatient services compare
with the risk among people never admitted for psychiatric
treatment?
Findings In this national, register-based cohort study of 1 683 385
Danish residents, 48 599 of whom were discharged from inpatient
psychiatric care for the first time, the risk of dying prematurely
within the first year of discharge was 16 times higher than the risk
for those who were not admitted to a psychiatric facility.
Meaning Because the risk of premature death from a range of
natural and unnatural causes is markedly elevated for this patient
population, clinicians, academics, and public health specialists
need to carefully consider the multiple mechanisms for premature
death that are likely implicated.

• Alcohol-related death: ICD-10 F10, G31.2, G62.1, I42.6, K29.2,
K70, K73, K74 (excluding K74.3-K74.5), K86.0, X45, X65, and
Y15. (These codes were based on International Classification
of Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD-9] and Tenth Revision [ICD-
10], as defined by the Office for National Statistics for En-
gland and Wales.23 Because ICD-9 was never implemented
in Denmark, only alcohol-related deaths that were assigned
ICD-10 codes and that occurred in 1994 and later years were
included [eTable 1 in the Supplement]).
Covariates
Time since first discharge, admission type (voluntary vs
involuntary), and psychiatric diagnosis at first admission
were obtained from the Danish Psychiatric Central Research
Register. Primary and secondary diagnoses were classified
using ICD-8 and ICD-10 codes as in previous Danish registry
studies, following the ICD-10 hierarchy24 (eTable 2 in the
Supplement). We have reported separate relative risks accord-
ing to these covariates; adjustment for the potential confound-
ing influences of sex, age, and time period is explained in the
next subsection.
Statistical Analyses
Data analysis took place between February 1, 2016, and
December 10, 2016. We calculated incidence rates and inci-
dence rate ratios (IRRs) to compare the mortality risk
between individuals following their first discharge from
inpatient psychiatric care and persons not admitted to a psy-
chiatric unit. For persons recorded as dying on the same day
as their discharge date, we could not distinguish whether the
death happened before or after discharge; we delineated
these cases as occurring before discharge. Aggregated
person-time was modeled using Poisson regression to esti-
mate IRRs and their 95% CIs, with adjustment for potential
confounding by sex and by age and calendar year fitted as
time-dependent variables, which were categorized as 5-year
bands. All analyses, except for the comparison of “within
1 year” with “after 1 year” after discharge (Figure), were
restricted to deaths occurring within the first 365 days after
discharge. We tested for Poisson overdispersion by addition-
ally fitting negative binomial regression models25 and com-
paring them with the originally fitted Poisson models. After
sex, age, and calendar year adjustment, none of the models
were overdispersed (eg, all-cause mortality among all per-
sons: likelihood ratio test, P = .50).
Results
Descriptive Statistics
The cohort consisted of 1 683 385 persons, of whom 48 599
were discharged from inpatient psychiatric care on or after
their 15th birthday (from January 1, 1982, through December
31, 2011). There was a slight preponderance of female
patients (25 006 [51.4%]) experiencing first discharge, almost
three-quarters of patients (35 660 [73.4%]) were aged 15 to 29
years, and most patients (33 995 [70.0%]) had a length of stay
of 30 days or less (Table 1). Most of these patients (45 643
[93.9%]) were admitted voluntarily, and one-fifth (9750
[20.1%]) had a history of attempted suicide before their first
discharge. See eTable 3 in the Supplement for prevalence
estimates of the physical illnesses delineated by the Charlson
Comorbidity Index28 for persons discharged from inpatient
psychiatric care as well as for a randomly sampled age- and
sex-matched comparison group. The prevalence of these con-
ditions was greater among the postdischarge group (eAppen-
dix 3 in the Supplement describes the methods used to gen-
erate these results).

Incidence Rate Ratios for All-Cause Mortality
and for All Unnatural and Natural Deaths
People discharged from inpatient psychiatric services for the
first time were at markedly elevated risk of dying prema-
turely than were individuals not admitted to psychiatric units
(Table 2). All-cause mortality risk was 16 times higher in the
first follow-up year (IRR, 16.2; 95% CI, 14.5-18.0), and no sta-
tistically significant evidence of a sex difference was ob-
served (χ 2
1 = 0.4; P = .51). Discharged persons had a much
greater risk for unnatural deaths compared with those not ad-
mitted (IRR, 25.0; 95% CI, 22.0-28.4), with women having a
higher relative risk than men (men: IRR, 21.8; 95% CI, 18.7-
25.3;women:IRR,39.0;95%CI,30.6-49.6)(χ2
1 = 13.0;P < .001).
The relative risk of dying from natural causes was consider-
ably lower than that from unnatural causes (IRR for dying from
natural causes, 8.6; 95% CI, 7.0-10.7). Unlike in unnatural
causes, no marked sex difference in relative risk was ob-
served in natural deaths (χ2
1 = 0.0; P = .95). Table 3 presents
the relative risks for all-cause mortality estimated separately
according to salient clinical characteristics. Risks were high-
est among individuals who were diagnosed at first inpatient
episode with psychoactive substance abuse disorders (IRR,
24.8; 95% CI, 21.0-29.4) and among those who were admit-
tedinvoluntarily(IRR,30.0;95%CI,22.4-40.2);riskswerealso
greatest during the first month after discharge (IRR, 32.9; 95%
CI, 25.5-42.5). Patients with comorbid substance abuse and
mental illness diagnoses (IRR, 21.2; 95% CI, 16.4-27.3) were at
higherriskthanthosewithonlyamentalillnessdiagnosis(IRR,
13.1; 95% CI, 11.4-15.1). Similar patterns were observed regard-
ing the risk of unnatural and natural death among persons dis-
charged for the first time from inpatient psychiatric services
vs those not admitted (eTables 4 and 5 in the Supplement).
Incidence Rate Ratios for Cause-Specific Mortality
Of the 245 cases of unnatural death within 1 year of first dis-
charge, most (146 [59.6%]) were suicides (Table 4). Among all
the specific causes examined, relative risk was highest for

inpatientswhosedeathwasclassifiedasbeingcausedbyamen-
tal disorder, 9 (69.2%) died of illicit drug and alcohol misuse
or dependence syndromes (IRR, 31.8; 95% CI, 16.2-62.35), and
9 of 14 deaths (64.3%) from digestive system diseases were at-
tributed to alcohol-induced conditions. Human immunode-
ficiency virus (HIV) cases accounted for most of the 7 deaths
from infections and parasitic diseases among recently dis-
charged inpatients (IRR, 71.4; 95% CI, 25.3-201.3). Because HIV
codes were unavailable in ICD-8, our analysis of this particu-
lar area was restricted to discharges occurring from 1994 on-
ward. As was seen among individuals who were not admit-
ted, the highest natural cause incidence rate observed among
people who were discharged was for neoplasms (36.6 per
100 000 person-years at risk), although the elevation in risk
was smaller than those for most of the other natural causes.
Incidence Rate Ratios for Short-term
vs Long-term Follow-up
In a comparison of the relative risk of dying between the first
yearafterdischarge(short-termfollow-up)andbeyondthefirst
year after discharge (long-term follow-up), greater risk eleva-
tions for most cause-specific mortality categories were ob-
served within the first year (Figure). Suicide represented the
greatest differential between short-term (IRR, 66.9; 95% CI,
56.4-79.4) and long-term (IRR, 24.2; 95% CI, 21.6-27.1) follow-
up. The Figure also presents large IRRs for alcohol-related
death; the IRR point estimate for this category was almost
twice as high in the short-term follow-up (IRR, 42.0; 95% CI,
26.6-66.1) as in the long-term follow-up (IRR, 22.5; 95% CI,
18.0-28.1).
Discussion
Summary of Findings
This national cohort study examined the full array of cause-
specific mortality outcomes among patients recently dis-
charged from inpatient psychiatric services. Compared with
persons not admitted, these patients were at elevated risk
for all types of mortality examined, and their risk for
unnatural death soon after discharge was much greater than
the risk for dying naturally. Clinical subgroups with particu-
larly high risk included persons who were admitted involun-
tarily and those who had substance abuse disorders. The
greatest relative risk observed was for suicide, followed by
alcohol-related death. Among the natural causes of death,
mental disorders and digestive diseases had the largest IRRs;
these excess risks were largely explained by substance abuse
disorders and alcohol-induced conditions, respectively. The
large IRR for fatal infectious diseases can be explained by a
preponderance of HIV cases,29 although the number of
observed deaths for this outcome was small. Death by neo-
plasm had the highest incidence among natural causes, but
the elevation in risk for patients who were discharged was
relatively modest, with a 4-fold increase over the risk
observed for those not admitted. Risk of dying within the
first year following first discharge from inpatient psychiatric
care was consistently greater than the risk after 1 year, and
the differential in relative risk between these 2 periods was
especially marked for suicide.
Comparison With Existing Evidence and Interpretation
Ourfindingsmostlyconcurwiththepublishedliteratureonpre-
maturemortalityamongpatientsdischargedfrominpatientpsy-
chiatric services. Several studies have reported that these pa-
tients are at high risk for dying prematurely10-16 and that their
risk of dying from unnatural causes is greater than that from
natural causes.11-13,16 The main reason for this finding is that
suicide risk is high among this patient population.11-13,15,16 A
10-fold increased risk for unintentional death among persons
with mental illness has been reported,30-32 although, to our
knowledge, unintentional death specifically during the post-
dischargeperiodhasnotbeenhighlightedinanypublishedstud-
ies. One possible explanation for this elevated risk is comorbid
substanceabuseandmentalillnessdiagnoses30;sleepingprob-
lems and chronic fatigue may also place former inpatients at
greater risk for serious unintentional injuries.33,34 Further-
more, intentional self-poisoning may often be misclassified
as an unintentional poisoning.35
In earlier studies, suicide and attempted suicide risks af-
ter discharge were reported as being elevated.10,36 Our study
indicated that relative risks for suicide, and all of the other
causes of death examined, decreased over time but remained
elevatednonetheless.Incompleterecovery,exposuretostress,
suboptimal professional care, and access to means of suicide
are possible explanations for this postdischarge risk.10 Stigma
surrounding psychiatric disorders, resulting in reluctance to
seek professional help, has also been considered a factor.37,38
In our study, the period shortly after discharge was when sui-
cide and other unnatural or natural deaths were most likely
to occur, especially among those individuals diagnosed with
psychoactive substance abuse disorders. We found that a large
proportion of postdischarge deaths were directly or indi-
rectly attributable to substance abuse.
Our study found a markedly elevated risk of death from
cancer among patients recently discharged from psychiatric
hospitalization. Although the relative risk was the lowest
among the natural causes of death we examined, the associa-
tion was nonetheless substantial; this is a topic that has been
much debated in the existing literature, with inconsistent find-
ings reported.16,39,40 Further research is needed to identify
the types of cancer most commonly linked with premature,
postdischarge deaths in this patient population.
Strengths and Limitations
The main strength of this study is that it examined a compre-
hensive array of cause-specific mortality outcomes in the con-
text of a range of psychiatric diagnoses. In addition, it used
high-quality Danish registry data17 and a large study cohort,
enabling us to report on rare causes of death with statistical
powerandprecision.Animportantlimitation,whichthisstudy
has in common with other registry studies,41 is the scarcity of
explanatoryvariablesavailable.Specifically,wecouldnotiden-
tify fatalities that happened on the same day a person was dis-
charged from inpatient psychiatric care, which may have
caused us to slightly underestimate the postdischarge rela-

tive risk. Furthermore, we could not distinguish between psy-
chiatric unit types (eg, acute adult vs forensic), whether a pa-
tient was formally discharged or had absconded,42 or whether
a patient was discharged into the community or to another in-
stitution. Another study limitation is that, although we inves-
tigated 48 599 persons after their first discharge from inpa-
tient psychiatric care, we lacked adequate power to examine
specific psychiatric diagnostic categories, such as unipolar de-
pression and bipolar disorder (which fall under the mood dis-
orders category). A final limitation is that the maximum fol-
low-up age was 44 years, which precludes the application of
our findings to middle-aged and older patients. For example,
suicide is less likely to be numerically predominant as a cause
of death among persons discharged from inpatient psychiat-
ric care across the entire adult age range through maturity and
older age.11
Conclusions
This study adds value to the existing literature in several ways.
First, to our knowledge, we conducted the most comprehen-
sive study to date of cause-specific natural and unnatural mor-
tality in this patient population. Second, we examined alcohol-
related death, an outcome that is underrepresented in the
literature, and considered substance abuse disorder as a psy-
chiatric diagnostic category in contrast to previous studies that
examined restricted sets of psychiatric diagnoses, such as
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.11 Last, we focused on pre-
mature mortality risk within the year after discharge, the
period of greatest clinical relevance.
For patients hospitalized with psychiatric disorders, the
time shortly after discharge is the period in which they are at
the highest risk for premature death from a variety of causes.
Clinicians should keep these patients safe by serving as a liai-
son between primary and secondary health care services to
ensure patients are receiving holistic care that meets their
physicalandmentalhealthneedsaswellasaddressestheirpsy-
chosocial problems. Mental health facilities and their partner
agencies need to work proactively and in unison to deter-
mine the risks likely to reemerge or become exacerbated at dis-
charge and to provide extra support to ameliorate the greatly
elevatedriskofunnaturaldeath.Patientswithalcoholanddrug
use disorders and those admitted involuntary should be moni-
tored particularly closely, interventions targeting substance
abuseshouldbeofferedtopatientsatearlystagesoftheirtreat-
ment, and dedicated care coordinators should provide appro-
priate levels of clinical surveillance. Given that risk is mark-
edly elevated for so many causes of death, and especially so
soon after discharge, clinicians, academics, and public health
specialists should carefully consider the multiple mecha-
nisms for premature death that are likely implicated.
