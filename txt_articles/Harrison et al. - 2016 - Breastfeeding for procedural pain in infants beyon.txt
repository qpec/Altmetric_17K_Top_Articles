Background
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) show that breastfeeding newborn infants during painful procedures reduces pain. Mechanisms
are considered to be multifactorial and include sucking, skin-to-skin contact, warmth, rocking, sound and smell of the mother, and
possibly endogenous opiates present in the breast milk.
Objectives
To determine the effect of breastfeeding on procedural pain in infants beyond the neonatal period (first 28 days of life) up to one year of
age compared to no intervention, placebo, parental holding, skin-to-skin contact, expressed breast milk, formula milk, bottle feeding,
sweet-tasting solutions (e.g. sucrose or glucose), distraction, or other interventions.
Search methods
We searched the following databases to 18 February 2016: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the
Cochrane Library), MEDLINE including In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations (OVID), Embase (OVID), PsycINFO (OVID),
and CINAHL (EBSCO); the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT), ClinicalTrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov), and the World Health
Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) (apps.who.int/trialsearch/) for ongoing trials.
Selection criteria
We included RCTs and quasi-RCTs involving infants aged 28 days postnatal to 12 months and receiving breastfeeding while undergoing
a painful procedure. Comparators included, but were not limited to, oral administration of water, sweet-tasting solutions, expressed
breast or formula milk, no intervention, use of pacifiers, positioning, cuddling, distraction, topical anaesthetics, and skin-to-skin care.
Procedures included, but were not limited to: subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, venipuncture, intravenous line insertion, heel
lance, and finger lance. We applied no language restrictions.

 Data collection and analysis
We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently considered trials for inclusion
in the review, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. The main outcome measures were behavioural or physiological indicators and
composite pain scores, as well as other clinically important outcomes reported by the authors of included studies. We pooled data for
the most comparable outcomes and where data from at least two studies could be included. We used mean difference (MD) with 95%
confidence interval (CI), employing a random-effects model for continuous outcomes measured on the same scales. For continuous
outcomes measured on different scales, we pooled standardised mean differences (SMDs) and associated 95% CIs. For dichotomous
outcomes, we planned to pool events between groups across studies using risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs. However, as insufficient
studies reported dichotomous outcomes, we did not pool such events. We assessed the evidence using GRADE and created a ’Summary
of findings’ table.
Main results
We included 10 studies with a total of 1066 infants. All studies were conducted during early childhood immunisation. As the breast-
feeding intervention cannot be blinded, we rated all studies as being at high risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel.
We assessed nine studies as being at low risk of bias for incomplete outcome data. In addition, we rated nine studies as high risk for
blinding of outcome assessment. We scored risk of bias related to random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and selective
reporting as unclear for the majority of the studies due to lack of information.
Our primary outcome was pain. Breastfeeding reduced behavioural pain responses (cry time and pain scores) during vaccination
compared to no treatment, oral water, and other interventions such as cuddling, oral glucose, topical anaesthetic, massage, and
vapocoolant. Breastfeeding did not consistently reduce changes in physiological indicators, such as heart rate. We pooled data for
duration of cry from six studies (n = 547 infants). Breastfeeding compared to water or no treatment resulted in a 38-second reduction in
cry time (MD -38, 95% CI -50 to -26; P < 0.00001). The quality of the evidence according to GRADE for this outcome was moderate,
as most infants were 6 months or younger, and outcomes may be different for infants during their 12-month immunisation. We pooled
data for pain scores from five studies (n = 310 infants). Breastfeeding was associated with a 1.7-point reduction in standardised pain
scores (SMD -1.7, 95% CI -2.2 to -1.3); we considered this evidence to be of moderate quality as data were primarily from infants
younger than 6 months of age. We could pool heart rate data following injections for only two studies (n = 186); we considered this
evidence to be of low quality due to insufficient data. There were no differences between breastfeeding and control (MD -3.6, -23 to
16).
Four of the 10 studies had more than two study arms. Breastfeeding was more effective in reducing crying duration or pain scores
during vaccination compared to: 25% dextrose and topical anaesthetic cream (EMLA), vapocoolant, maternal cuddling, and massage.
No included studies reported adverse events.
Authors’ conclusions
We conclude, based on the 10 studies included in this review, that breastfeeding may help reduce pain during vaccination for infants
beyond the neonatal period. Breastfeeding consistently reduced behavioural responses of cry duration and composite pain scores during
and following vaccinations. However, there was no evidence that breastfeeding had an effect on physiological responses. No studies
included in this review involved populations of hospitalised infants undergoing other skin-breaking procedures. Although it may be
possible to extrapolate the review results to this population, further studies of efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability in this population
are warranted.

Does breastfeeding reduce vaccination pain in babies aged 1 to 12 months?
Bottom line
We found that breastfeeding before and during vaccination injections helped to reduce pain in most babies up to the age of one year.
Background
Needles are used for babies’ early childhood vaccinations and medical care during childhood illnesses. These are essential, but painful.
They cause distress for the babies and often their parents/caregivers, and can result in future anxiety and fear about needles. Breastfeeding

 during blood tests in newborn babies reduces pain. Breastfeeding when possible and feasible may also help to comfort babies and reduce
their pain beyond the newborn period and throughout infancy.
Study characteristics
In February 2016 we searched the medical literature for studies examining the effectiveness of breastfeeding babies 1 to 12 months
old during the use of needles. We compared effectiveness of breastfeeding in reducing pain (as scored by crying time and pain scores),
to holding, babies lying flat, or the giving of water or sweet solutions. We found 10 studies with a total of 1066 infants. All studies
examined if breastfeeding reduced pain during vaccinations.
Key results
Breastfeeding reduced crying in young babies having vaccinations. On average, breastfed babies cried for 38 seconds less than babies
who were not breastfed (6 studies; 547 infants; moderate-quality evidence), and pain scores were significantly lower (5 studies; 310
infants; moderate-quality evidence).
No studies reported on any harm (very low-quality evidence). We could draw no conclusions on risk of harm while breastfeeding
healthy babies during vaccination.
Going forward: if mothers are breastfeeding, it could be considered when possible for babies during vaccinations. More evidence is
needed to learn if breastfeeding helps older babies and babies in hospital during blood work or procedures such as insertion of drips.
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the evidence was moderate for crying time and pain scores. Most studies included younger infants aged 1 to 6 months.
Further research including older infants up to 12 months of age may change our conclusions. In addition, the studies evaluated the
effects of breastfeeding during vaccination. We do not know whether breastfeeding helps sick babies aged 1 to 12 months in hospital
during blood sampling or drip insertion.

Breastfeeding for procedural pain in infants beyond the neonatal period (Review)

 B A C K G R O U N D
Infants and children require needle-related painful procedures for
scheduled childhood immunisations (PHA Canada 2014), as well
asmedical proceduresperformedfordiagnosticandtreatmentpur-
poses during the course of childhood illnesses (Johnston 2011).
Such procedures are known to be painful, causing distress at the
time of the procedure and for many children, anxiety and fear dur-
ingsubsequentneedle-relatedprocedures(Schechter 2007; Taddio
2007; Taddio 2009; Wright 2009), and altered pain responses later
in life (Taddio 2005). Fear of the pain associated with immuni-
sations, with subsequent fear of needles, has been shown to be
one of the reasons why parents do not complete their infants’ rec-
ommended immunisation schedule (Mills 2005; Schechter 2007;
Taddio 2007; Taddio 2009; Wright 2009). It is therefore impera-
tive that effective pain management strategies be consistently used
for infants and children in diverse settings where needle-related
painful procedures are performed.
Recentlyconductedsystematicreviewsof painmanagementstrate-
gies in the newborn period demonstrated that breastfeeding, in
Shah 2012, and sweet solutions of sucrose, in Stevens 2013, and
glucose, in Bueno 2013, reduced behavioural responses and com-
posite pain scores during painful procedures. In addition, system-
atic reviews of sweet-tasting solutions beyond the neonatal pe-
riod up to one year of age demonstrated analgesic effects during
needle-related painful procedures when compared to water or no
treatment (Harrison 2010a; Kassab 2012). There is a need for this
evidence relating to analgesic effects of breastfeeding beyond the
newborn period to be systematically reviewed on an ongoing basis
to critically evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention in infants
up to one year of age.
Description of the condition
Studies of pain management strategies used during commonly per-
formed needle-related procedures show inconsistent use of recom-
mended interventions (Harrison 2013; Johnston 2011; Stevens
2011; Taddio 2007). However, itisknownthatuntreatedorpoorly
treated procedural pain has negative effects, including infant and
parental distress at the time of the procedure, with the risk of
longer-term fear of needles (Schechter 2007; Taddio 1995; Taddio
2007; Taddio 2009; Wright 2009).
Description of the intervention
Breastfeedingcommencedpriortothe painful procedure, andcon-
tinuing throughout the procedure until completion. High-quality
evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic
reviews supports the role of breastfeeding in reducing procedural
pain during the neonatal period (first 28 days of life). Shah and
colleagues conducted a systematic review of 20 RCTs or quasi-
RCTs evaluating breastfeeding (10 studies) or supplemental breast
milk placed on the tongue or given through gastric tube (10 stud-
ies) during heel lance or venipuncture in newborn infants (Shah
2012). The authors concluded that breastfeeding effectively re-
duced behavioural responses, including crying duration and total
crying time, facial expressions and pain scores, as well the physio-
logical response of heart rate, compared to positioning (swaddled
and nursed in a crib), holding by the mother, placebo, or no in-
tervention.
How the intervention might work
Several elements are postulated to contribute to the analgesic ef-
fects of breastfeeding. These include skin-to-skin contact, sight,
sound and smell of the mother, sucking, distraction, pleasant and
slightly sweet taste, and intake of naturally occurring endorphins
thatare presentinbreastmilk(Blass 1995; Blass 1997; Shah 2012).
As detailed in Shah 2012, breast milk also contains higher concen-
trations of tryptophan compared to formula milk (Heine 1999).
Tryptophan is a precursor to melatonin, which in animal stud-
ies has been shown to increase concentrations of beta-endorphin
(Barrett 2000), a naturally occurring endorphin that is assumed to
be one of the mechanisms responsible for the analgesic effects of
breast milk. However, small volumes of expressed breast milk do
not result in analgesia. Expressed breast milk given in small quanti-
ties failed to consistently reduce physiological or behavioural pain
indicators or composite pain scores (Shah 2012). This discrepancy
may be due to the contribution of multiple factors influencing
analgesia during breastfeeding other than taste alone, including
maternal contact, skin-to-skin contact, familiar smell, heart rate
and body movement, sucking, and intake of naturally occurring
endorphins present in the breast milk (Harrison 2010b; Zanardo
2001). As breast milk contains around 7% lactose, which is the
least sweet of the sugars (sucrose > fructose > glucose > lactose)
(Blass 1992), the mildly sweet taste most likely contributes little to
analgesia in isolation (e.g. delivered by oral syringe or via pacifier).
Bottle feeding larger volumes of either breast milk or formula milk
also removes the multiple analgesic factors associated with being
held skin-to-skin. Evidence of the analgesic effects of breastfeed-
ing in newborn infants is demonstrated in a publicly accessible
YouTube video (Harrison 2016).
Why it is important to do this review
Although a systematic review of breastfeeding newborn infants
during painful procedures was shown to effectively reduce pain
(Shah 2012), and a systematic review of multiple strategies to
reduce immunisation pain, which included breastfeeding, also
demonstrated analgesic effects of breastfeeding (Shah 2009), to
date there is no published systematic review that exclusively fo-
cuses on the effectiveness of breastfeeding for pain management

 during painful procedures beyond the neonatal period. This re-
view is therefore important to further establish the effectiveness
of breastfeeding in infants up to one year of age. This strategy has
universal applicability for breastfeeding mothers, as it requires no
additional cost, no special equipment, and no special preparation
or storage.
O B J E C T I V E S
We sought to determine the effect of breastfeeding on procedural
pain in infants beyond the neonatal period (first 28 days of life) up
to one year of age compared to no intervention, placebo, parental
holding, skin-to-skin contact, expressed breast milk, formula milk,
bottle feeding, sweet-tasting solutions (e.g. sucrose or glucose),
distraction, or other interventions.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We included RCTs and quasi-RCTs as defined by the Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011b).
Types of participants
Infants undergoing a painful procedure who are 28 days postnatal
age (corrected for prematurity, 37 weeks plus 28 days) up to aged
12 months, including infants receiving their 12-month vaccina-
tion. The procedures included, but were not limited to: subcuta-
neous or intramuscular injection, venipuncture, intravenous line
insertion, heel lance, and finger lance.
Types of interventions
Breastfeeding during a painful procedure, with or without addi-
tional interventions such as topical anaesthetic agents or sweet
solutions. We did not classify expressed breast milk delivered by
methods such as a dropper, syringe, spoon, or bottle as breast-
feeding, but did include such delivery methods as comparators in
control or other treatment arms.
Comparators included oral administration of: water, sweet-tasting
solutions (such as sucrose or glucose), expressed breast or formula
milk, no intervention, use of pacifiers, positioning, cuddling, dis-
traction, topical anaesthetics, and skin-to-skin care, also referred
to as kangaroo care.
We included all settings where breastfeeding was evaluated for
pain reduction during painful procedures. These included inpa-
tient hospital units, emergency departments, and outpatient or
community settings.
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
The primary outcome was pain, as assessed by at least one of the
following.
• Behavioural indicators such as:
◦ cry variables (duration of crying, expressed in total
seconds of crying or proportion of duration of crying during
painful procedure or following completion of painful procedure
(recovery period));
◦ facial expressions (grimace); or
◦ body posture and movements.
• Physiological responses such as heart rate, heart rate
variability, respiratory rate, transcutaneous oxygen (TcPO2),
transcutaneous carbon dioxide (TcPCO2), oxygen saturation
(SpO2), or other measures such as skin conductance or
biomedical markers (e.g. serum, salivary or urinary cortisol).
• Composite pain measures: unidimensional or
multidimensional (including a combination of behavioural,
physiological, and contextual indicators).
Secondary outcomes
1. Other clinically important outcomes reported by authors of
included studies (not prespecified).
2. Any adverse effects reported by authors (e.g. choking,
gagging, spitting, coughing).
Timing of measurements and aggregation of data will vary from
study to study, but common times of measurement include:
• baseline prior to delivery of intervention/control;
• upon commencement of procedure;
• 15, 30, 60, 120, 180 seconds following commencement of
procedure;
• throughout entire duration of procedure; and
• up to 10 minutes following completion of procedure.
Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
We searched the following databases.
• Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL), the Cochrane Library (Issue 1 of 12, 2016).
• MEDLINE including In-Process & Other Non-Indexed
Citations (OVID) (1946 to 18 February 2016).

 • Embase (OVID) (1947 to 18 February 2016).
• PsycINFO (OVID) (1806 to 18 February 2016).
• CINAHL (EBSCO) (searched 18 February 2016).
Our librarian (MS), who is highly qualified in systematic re-
view searching, developed the MEDLINE search strategy, which
another librarian peer reviewed using the Peer Review of Elec-
tronic Search Strategies (PRESS) standard (McGowan 2010). We
adapted the MEDLINE search strategy for the other databases (see
Appendix 1, Appendix 2, Appendix 3, Appendix 4, Appendix 5).
We limited study design to controlled trials only in MEDLINE
and Embase. We applied no language restrictions. We included
studies irrespective of their publication status. In addition, we re-
viewed eligible studies for cited references.
Searching other resources
As per Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care (PaPaS) Re-
view Group recommendations, we also searched the metaRegister
of controlled trials (mRCT), ClinicalTrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov),
and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials
Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) (apps.who.int/trialsearch/) for
ongoing trials. In addition, we checked reference lists of reviews
and retrieved articles; relevant recent neonatal, paediatric, and pain
journals; and paediatric pain conference proceedings.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two review authors (JR and MB) independently screened abstracts
to identify potentially eligible studies found via electronic search-
ing. Any conflicts were resolved through a consensus process, with
a third review author (DH), if required. We retrieved full-text arti-
cles of all potentially relevant abstracts, which two review authors
(JR and MB) independently assessed for inclusion. We resolved all
discrepancies over the full texts through a consensus process or by
consulting a third review author (DH) if required. We included a
PRISMA study flow diagram to document the screening process
(Liberati 2009), as recommended in Part 2, Section 11.2.1 of the
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins
2011a).
Data extraction and management
We extracted the following data from each study: study design,
setting, age of infants, overall sample size, sample size per group,
number of groups, painful procedure, and outcomes and adverse
events per groups as reported by the authors. Two review authors
(JR and MB or JR and CL) independently extracted data from
the studies using a standardised data extraction form. Differences
were resolved through a consensus process or by consulting a third
review author (DH) when necessary.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
We used standard methods of Cochrane to assess the potential
risk of bias using the Cochrane ’Risk of bias’ classification tool
(Higgins 2011b).
Two review authors (JR and MB) independently assessed risk of
bias for each study, using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and adapted from
those used by the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group,
with any disagreements resolved by discussion or by consulting
a third review author (DH), if necessary (Higgins 2011a). The
review authors were not blinded to authors or institutions. We
assessed the following for each study.
Selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation
concealment)
Random sequence generation
For each included study, we categorised the risk of selection bias
as:
• low risk: adequate (any truly random process, e.g. random
number table, computer random number generator);
• high risk: inadequate (any non-random process, e.g. odd or
even date of birth, hospital or clinic record number); or
• unclear risk: no or unclear information provided.
Allocation concealment
The method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to
assignment determines whether intervention allocation could have
been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed
after assignment. For each included study, we categorised the risk
of bias regarding allocation concealment as:
• low risk: adequate (e.g. telephone or central randomisation;
consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes);
• high risk: inadequate (open random allocation; unsealed or
non-opaque envelopes; alternation; date of birth); or
• unclear risk: no or unclear information provided.
Blinding of participants, personnel, and outcome assessors
(performance and detection bias)
Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias)
Due to the nature of the intervention of breastfeeding, blinding of
participants and personnel was not possible. Nevertheless,for each
included study, we categorised the methods used to blind study
participants and personnel to knowledge of which intervention a
participant received as:
8
Breastfeeding for procedural pain in infants beyond the neonatal period (Review)

 • low risk: adequate for personnel (a placebo that could not
be distinguished from the active solution was used in the control
group);
• high risk: inadequate (participants or personnel were aware
of group assignment); or
• unclear risk: no or unclear information provided.
Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias)
For each included study, we categorised the methods used to blind
outcome assessors to knowledge of which intervention a partici-
pant received (if the study population consisted of young children
unable to verbalise, they were considered to pose no risk of reveal-
ing group assignment). We assessed blinding separately for differ-
ent outcomes or classes of outcomes. We categorised the methods
used with regards to detection bias as:
• low risk: adequate (study states that pain assessment from
audio data or physiological data download was blinded and
describes the method used to achieve blinding);
• high risk: inadequate (assessors at follow-up were aware of
group assignment); or
• unclear risk: no or unclear information provided.
Incomplete outcome data
Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)
For each included study and for each outcome, we described the
completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the
analysis. We noted whether attrition and exclusions were reported,
the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with
the total randomised participants), whether reasons for attrition
or exclusion were reported, and whether missing data were bal-
anced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where suffi-
cient information was reported or supplied by the trial authors, we
planned to re-include missing data in the analyses. We categorised
the methods with respect to attrition bias as:
• low risk: adequate (less than 10% missing data);
• high risk: inadequate (more than 10% missing data); or
• unclear risk: no or unclear information provided.
Selective outcome reporting
Selective outcome reporting (reporting bias)
For each included study, we described how we investigated the
risk of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We
assessed the methods as:
• low risk: adequate (where it is clear that all of the study’s
prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to
the review have been reported, as per the study protocol);
• high risk: inadequate (where not all of the study’s
prespecified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported
primary outcomes were not prespecified; outcomes of interest are
reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study failed to
include results of a key outcome that would have been expected
to have been reported, as per the study protocol); or
• unclear risk: no or unclear information provided (the study
protocol was not available).
Other bias
Other potential sources of bias
For each included study, we described any important concerns we
had about other possible sources of bias (e.g. whether there was
a potential source of bias related to the specific study design or
whether the trial was stopped early due to some data-dependent
process). We assessed whether each study was free of other prob-
lems that could put it at risk of bias as:
• low risk (no concerns of other bias raised);
• high risk (concerns raised about multiple examinations of
the data before completion of data collection; differences in the
number of participants enrolled between the abstract and final
publications of the paper); or
• unclear (concerns raised about potential sources of bias that
could not be verified by contacting the authors).
Size
Size - based on number of participants in each study arm
According to the Cochrane PaPaS Review Group guidance on
sample size, for each included study we evaluated risk of bias based
on number of participants included in the study as:
• low risk (≥ 200 participants per arm);
• high risk (< 50 participants per arm); or
• unclear risk (50 to 199 participants per arm).
We integratedriskof biasresultsintothe analyseswhereverpossible
in the results of this review.
Measures of treatment effect
We used the statistical package Review Manager 5 provided by
Cochrane (RevMan 2014). For continuous outcomes, we ex-
tracted mean scores and their standard deviations in the treatment
and control groups. For dichotomous outcomes, we collected the
number of events per comparison group.
We pooled data for the most comparable outcomes and where data
from at least two studies could be included. This included data for
cry duration, standardised mean pain scores, Neonatal Infant Pain
Scale (NIPS) pain scores, and heart rate following the procedure.

 Unit of analysis issues
The unit of analysis was the infant receiving breastfeeding or
control. When multiple intervention groups were included, the
primary comparison was breastfeeding compared to the control
group, or group receiving ’no intervention’.
For cross-over trials, we used the data from the first intervention
infants received and treated the study as a RCT.
Dealing with missing data
We presented the data in narrative form only if the data were not
in a format suitable for use in Review Manager 5. We attempted
to contact study authors if data were missing or required clarifi-
cation, requesting data in a format that could be used for inclu-
sion in meta-analyses, and obtained the necessary information to
complete a ’Risk of bias’ assessment.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We explored heterogeneity using the I2 statistic (Higgins 2011a),
and visually inspected forest plots for heterogenous estimates of
effect. We graded the degree of heterogeneity as none, low, mod-
erate, and high for values of < 25%, 25% to 49%, 50% to 74%,
and ≥ 75%, respectively (GRADEpro 2015). We explored possi-
ble causes of heterogeneity using sensitivity analysis if applicable.
We used the I2 statistic for between-study heterogeneity to assess
the appropriateness of pooling data from studies for meta-anal-
yses, employing random-effects models. We used GRADEpro to
present a summary of findings table in this review (Summary of
findings for the main comparison; GRADEpro 2015).
Assessment of reporting biases
We planned to use Review Manager 5 funnel plots to investigate
small-study effects. However, no single meta-analysis included at
least 10 trials (Higgins 2011b; Sterne 2011).
Data synthesis
We pooled data for the most comparable outcomes and where data
from at least two studies could be included using mean difference
(MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI), employing a random-
effects model for continuous outcomes measured on the same
scales. For continuous outcomes measured on different scales, we
pooled standardised mean differences (SMDs) and associated 95%
CIs.
For dichotomous outcomes, we had planned to pool events be-
tween groups across studies using risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs,
risk differences (RDs), and number needed to treat for an addi-
tional beneficial outcome (NNTB) or number needed to treat for
an additional harmful outcome (NNTH). However, there were
no data reported as dichotomous outcomes that we were able to
pool.
Quality of the evidence
Two review authors (MB and JR) independently rated the quality
of all outcomes (behavioural responses (crying time, pain scores)
and physiological outcomes of heart rate and oxygen saturation).
The first review author (DH) reviewed and finalised all decisions
with MB and JR. We used the GRADE system to rank the quality
of the evidence employing GRADEpro GDT software and the
guidelines provided in Section 12.2 of the Cochrane Handbook for
Systematic Reviews of Interventions (GRADEPro GDT 2015).
The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations,
consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication
bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome.
The GRADE system uses the following criteria for assigning grade
of evidence.
• High: further research is very unlikely to change our
confidence in the estimate of effect.
• Moderate: further research is likely to have an important
impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may
change the estimate.
• Low: further research is very likely to have an important
impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to
change the estimate.
• Very low: any estimate of effect is very uncertain.
Summary of findings table
We included a summary of findings table table to present the main
findings in a transparent and simple tabular format. In particular,
we included key information concerning the quality of the evi-
dence, the magnitude of effect of the interventions examined, and
the sum of available data on the outcomes of crying time, pain
scores, and heart rate.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
If, as we expected, the majority of eligible trials were related to the
procedure of vaccination, we planned to report data by age group,
and perform subgroup analyses according to the early-childhood
immunisation schedules of 2, 4, 6, and 12 months’ age groups, if
possible. For trials using breastfeeding plus another intervention,
we subgrouped these into breastfeeding alone and breastfeeding
plus another intervention. We performed subgroup analyses on
different comparisons (i.e. no treatment, water, sucrose).
Sensitivity analysis
We includedall studiesregardlessof theirriskof bias, andpresented
a narrative discussion of the potential influence of the risk of bias.

Results of the search
Our initial search of the literature retrieved 756 records after du-
plicates were removed. Two review authors (JR and MB) screened
the 756 titles and abstracts and identified 62 potentially eligible
studies. We excluded 52 studies, primarily because the paper was
a commentary, editorial, or conference abstract only. We finally
included a total of 10 studies with 1066 infants (Figure 1). There
were no disagreements between the two review authors that re-
quired a third review author to reach a consensus.

 Included studies
Details of the included studies are summarised in Characteristics
of included studies.
All 10 included studies evaluated breastfeeding during vaccina-
tion injections. Nine studies evaluated breastfeeding during a
single vaccination episode; one evaluated breastfeeding during
two episodes of vaccination, at 2 and again at 4 months (Barr
unpublished). Of the 10 included studies, eight were RCTs (Barr
unpublished; Boroumandfar 2013; Dilli 2009; Efe 2007; Esfahani
2013; Goswami 2013; Gupta 2013; Taavoni 2009a), and two
were quasi-RCTs (Razek 2009; Thomas 2011). All 10 studies
involved intramuscular injections including HepB (hepatitis B)
(Boroumandfar 2013; Dilli 2009; Esfahani 2013), DPT (diphthe-
ria, tetanus, pertussis) (Barr unpublished; Boroumandfar 2013;
Dilli2009; Efe2007; Esfahani2013; Goswami 2013; Gupta2013;
Taavoni 2009a; Thomas 2011), DTaP-IPV (diptheria, tetanus,
pertussis, polio) (Dilli 2009), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Dilli
2009), MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) (Esfahani 2013), bacillus
Calmette-Guérin (Dilli 2009), and one study did not identify the
type of vaccination (Razek 2009).
The studies included infants aged 0 to 12 months. For the one
study that included infants under the age of one month (Dilli
2009), we obtained study data from the first author and only
included data for infants over the age of one month in this re-
view. Study sample sizes, based on the number of participants in-
cluded in this review, ranged from 40 to 144 in total. Four studies
reported a sample size calculation (Barr unpublished; Goswami
2013; Gupta 2013; Taavoni 2009a). Barr unpublished estimated
their sample size using cry data from previous immunisation stud-
ies (effect size of 0.40, type I and type II error rates of 5% and
10%); Goswami 2013 based their sample size on their primary
outcome of cry duration (90% power and significance of 0.05);
Gupta 2013 based their sample size on a previously conducted
pilot study (90% power and significance of 0.05); Taavoni 2009a
based their sample size on a 95% confidence interval and 90%
power.
All studies involved an intervention group with the mother initi-
ating breastfeeding prior to the immunisation procedure and con-
tinuing breastfeeding during the immunisation procedure. The
breastfeeding group in one study also received 1 g of topical anaes-
thetic cream (EMLA Cream), applied topically on the injection
site 60 minutes before the immunisation (Gupta 2013). All stud-
ies included a comparison group where the infant received no
pain treatment. Four studies included other comparator groups: 2
mL of 25% dextrose (Goswami 2013); 1 g EMLA Cream plus 2
mL oral distilled water (Gupta 2013); massage therapy (Esfahani
2013); and topical vapocoolant spray (Boroumandfar 2013).
Six studies measured cry duration (Barr unpublished; Dilli 2009;
Efe 2007; Goswami 2013; Gupta 2013; Razek 2009), and two
studies measured latency of onset of cry (Goswami 2013; Gupta
2013). Eight studies included at least one validated pain scale as an
outcome measurement, including the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale
(NIPS) (Boroumandfar 2013; Dilli 2009; Esfahani 2013; Razek
2009; Thomas 2011), Neonatal Facial Coding System (NFCS)
(Barr unpublished), Modified Facial Coding System (MFCS)
(Goswami 2013; Gupta 2013), Modified Behavioral Pain Scale
(MBPS) (Taavoni 2009a), and Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rat-
ing Scale (Razek 2009). Three studies measured physiological re-
sponses (Barr unpublished; Efe 2007; Razek 2009). Razek 2009
reported heart rate before and after the injection. Efe 2007 re-
ported heart rate and oxygen saturation during and after the injec-
tion (Efe 2007). One study also measured facial flushing before,
during, and after the injection and salivary cortisol level before
and after the injection (Barr unpublished).
Excluded studies
Of the 62 titles/abstracts identified as potentially eligible for in-
clusion, we excluded 52. Thirty-one of these were commentaries,
newsletters, or editorials, and four were conference proceedings
with no relevant abstracts identified. Of the remaining 17 excluded
studies, eight were reported as conference abstracts only (Barr
2001; Gradin 2003; Singal 2004; Taavoni 2009b; Taavoni 2010;
Taavoni 2011; Taavoni 2012; Taavoni 2013), five studied popu-
lations younger than our inclusion criteria (Gray 2002; Hashemi
2016; Modarres 2014; Shendurnikar 2005; Uga 2008), three did
not use breastfeeding during the painful procedure (Achema 2011;
Jebreili 2015; Sahebihag 2011), and one was not a RCT or quasi-
RCT (Otero López 2014).

 Allocation
Random sequence generation
We rated five studies as at low risk of bias for random sequence gen-
eration that used methods such as shuffling envelopes (Efe 2007),
use of a random number table (Esfahani 2013; Taavoni 2009a),
or computer-generated random numbers (Goswami 2013; Gupta
2013). We assessed one study as being at high risk of bias since
it was a quasi-experimental study and thus did not involve ran-
domisation of participants (Razek 2009). We rated four studies
in which the specific randomisation method was not described
as unclear (Barr unpublished; Boroumandfar 2013; Dilli 2009;
Thomas 2011).
Allocation concealment
We rated two studies as being at low risk of bias for allocation
concealment as they both used the SNOSE method (serially num-
bered, opaque, sealed envelopes) (Goswami 2013; Gupta 2013).
We rated the remaining eight studies as unclear, as not enough
information was provided to assess how allocation was concealed
(Barr unpublished; Boroumandfar 2013; Dilli 2009; Efe 2007;
Esfahani 2013; Razek 2009; Taavoni 2009a; Thomas 2011).
Blinding
Blinding of participants and personnel
We rated all studies as at high risk for blinding of participants and
personnel due to the nature of using breastfeeding as a pain man-
agement intervention; there is no practical way for the mothers,
healthcare professionals performing the vaccinations, and research
staff present during the procedure to be blinded to whether the
infant is breastfeeding or not.
Blinding of outcome assessment
We rated only one study as at low risk of bias for blinding of
outcome assessment; the study used audio recording only, thus
ensuring that the research personnel coding the cry time were not
able to see if the infant was being breastfed or not (Efe 2007). The
remaining nine studies either completed the outcome assessment
at the time of the procedure (Boroumandfar 2013; Dilli 2009;
Esfahani 2013; Razek 2009; Taavoni 2009a; Thomas 2011), or
used video recording (Barr unpublished; Goswami 2013; Gupta
2013), and were therefore assessed as being at high risk of bias due
to the inability to blind outcome assessors to breastfeeding.
Incomplete outcome data
We rated nine studies as at low risk of bias for incomplete out-
come data, as they either reported that all randomised infants were
included in the results (Efe 2007; Goswami 2013; Gupta 2013;
Razek 2009; Taavoni 2009a; Thomas 2011), or more than 90% of
participants completed the study (Barr unpublished; Dilli 2009;
Esfahani 2013). In one study, there was no information on how
many infants were randomised and completed the study per group,
and was thus rated as unclear (Boroumandfar 2013).
Selective reporting
We rated one study as at high risk of bias that presented the
outcome data in a way that was inconsistent with the recom-
mended use of the validated pain scales being used (Razek 2009).
We rated eight studies as being at unclear risk of bias related to
selective reporting: seven studies did not have a study protocol
registered in the trial registries searched (metaRegister of Con-
trolled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov), and the World
Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Plat-
form (apps.who.int/trialsearch/)), therefore there was insufficient
information to judge (Barr unpublished; Boroumandfar 2013;
Dilli 2009; Efe 2007; Esfahani 2013; Goswami 2013; Taavoni
2009a; Thomas 2011), and the remaining study had a protocol
available, but it was registered retrospectively (Gupta 2013).
Other potential sources of bias
Sample size
We rated nine studies as at high risk of bias due to fewer than 50 in-
fantsbeingenrolledineach arm(Barr unpublished; Boroumandfar
2013; Dilli2009; Efe2007; Esfahani2013; Goswami 2013;Gupta
2013; Taavoni 2009a; Thomas 2011). One study had between
50 and 199 infants enrolled in each arm and was thus rated as
at unclear risk of bias (Razek 2009). It should be noted that
although Barr unpublished, Goswami 2013, Gupta 2013, and
Taavoni 2009a were rated as at high risk of bias for sample size
based on the Cochrane PaPaS guidance on sample size, these four
studies reported performing sample size calculations. It should also
be noted that Dilli 2009 included 162 infants between the ages of
0 and 6 months in their breastfeeding study (77 in breastfeeding
group, 85 in control group), but because we only included the
data for infants between the aged of 1 and 6 months, the reduced
number per group led us to rate the study as at high risk of bias
for sample size.

 Other
We rated most studies as at low risk for other sources of bias
(Barr unpublished; Boroumandfar 2013; Efe2007; Esfahani2013;
Goswami 2013; Gupta 2013; Taavoni 2009a; Thomas 2011). One
study, Razek 2009, included use of a pain assessment tool (Wong-
Baker FACES), which is considered as self report (Wong 1999),
yet was reported by nursing staff. This tool is not validated for the
infant population and was therefore rated as at high risk of bias.
We rated one study as at unclear risk of bias due to demographic
data (including information on number of injections and type of
injection) being presented for the whole group only, rather than
by intervention and control group (Dilli 2009).
Effects of interventions
See: Summary of findings for the main comparison
Breastfeeding compared with other interventions, oral water, or no
treatment for pain during vaccination in infants 1 to 12 months
Breastfeeding versus control: cry duration
Six studies comparing breastfeeding (547 infants in total) to con-
trol conditions reported cry duration during immunisation. Three
studies reported the duration of crying up to a maximum of 3
minutes (Efe 2007; Goswami 2013; Gupta 2013), and two stud-
ies reported the period until all crying ceased (Dilli 2009; Razek
2009). One study reported the percentage of time the infant cried
during three time periods (Barr unpublished): 60 seconds before
the injection; from time of injection to 10 seconds after the in-
jection; and from 11 seconds to 60 seconds after the injection.
We obtained the raw data from the study authors. To make the
data more consistent with other data in this meta-analysis, we con-
verted the raw data from Barr unpublished from percentage of
time crying to cry time in seconds between time of injection and
60 seconds after the injection. Barr unpublished collected data
from the same infants at two months and again at four months.
We assumed independence and entered both age groups separately
into this meta-analysis.
Goswami 2013 included three groups (breastfeeding, 25% dex-
trose, distilled water). For the purpose of meta-analysis, to ensure
the groups were as comparable as possible, we included data for
breastfeeding compared to distilled water in Analysis 1.1. Gupta
2013 also included three groups: topical EMLA combined with
breastfeeding; topical EMLA combined with water; and topical
placebocreamcombinedwith water. Forthe purpose of meta-anal-
ysis, we included data for topical EMLA combined with breast-
feeding and topical EMLA combined with water in Analysis 1.1
to ensure the groups were as comparable as possible.
We pooled data for cry time (in seconds) from these six studies.
Analysis 1.1 and Figure 4 show the results of the meta-analysis.
There was a significant reduction in cry time in seconds in the
breastfeeding groups compared to the control groups (MD -38,
95% CI -50 to -26; P < 0.00001). However, there was high be-
tween-study heterogeneity (I2 = 85%).
Figure 4.
Forest plot of comparison: 1 Breastfeeding versus control, outcome: 1.1 Cry duration.
We judged the quality of the evidence according to the GRADE
criteria, for breastfeeding during vaccinations, on the outcome of
cry duration, to be moderate. Most of the included infants were
younger than 6 months of age, and outcomes may be different
for older infants during their 12-month immunisation. We did
not further downgrade the quality of evidence, but consider that
further research is likely to have an important impact on our con-
fidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate
(Summary of findings for the main comparison).
Breastfeeding versus control: all pain scores
We pooled data for pain scores following immunisation from
5 studies and 310 infants (NIPS - Dilli 2009, Esfahani 2013,
Thomas 2011; MFCS - Gupta 2013; MBPS - Taavoni 2009a).
Pain scores were collected at more than one time point for Gupta

 2013, Taavoni 2009a, and Thomas 2011. The data used in this
meta-analysis was for the closest time point following completion
of the procedure. We conducted the meta-analysis using standard-
ised mean differences (SMD). Results showed a significant reduc-
tion in pain scores in the breastfeeding group compared to the con-
trol (SMD -1.7, 95% CI -2.2 to -1.3; P < 0.00001) and moderate
between-study heterogeneity (I2 = 69%) (Analysis 1.2; Figure 5).
Figure 5.
Forest plot of comparison: 1 Breastfeeding versus control, outcome: 1.2 All pain scores during
injection.
We could not include MFCS scores from Goswami 2013 (for
breastfeeding and control groups) in this composite pain score
meta-analysis, as data were presented in graphical form only. We
contacted the authors requesting raw data but did not receive a
response.
We judged the quality of the evidence according to the GRADE
criteria, for breastfeeding during vaccinations, on the outcome
of combined pain scores, to be moderate. Most of the included
infants were younger than 6 months of age, and outcomes may be
different for older infants during their 12-month immunisation.
Breastfeeding versus control: NIPS
Five studies reported NIPS scores during immunisation (
Boroumandfar 2013; Dilli 2009; Esfahani 2013; Razek 2009;
Thomas 2011). Dilli 2009 included infants between the ages of 0
and 6 months, however they provided us with raw data, and we
excluded infants under the age of 1 month from the analysis.
Boroumandfar 2013 presented the data in dichotomous form only
(pain = NIPS score greater than 3, or no pain = NIPS score 3 or
less), which precluded inclusion in meta-analyses. We requested
data from the authors but did not receive a response; we have
therefore reported the data in narrative form only. The authors
reported statistically significant differences in frequency of pain
between the three groups (breastfeeding, vapocoolant, and con-
trol), with the breastfeeding group having significantly lower NIPS
scores during the vaccination procedure (P < 0.001).
Razek 2009 presented the frequency of infants with NIPS scores
of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and “hurts worst”. The inclusion of the “hurts
worst” category is inconsistent with the NIPS tool, which is a score
ranging from 0 to 7. We contacted the authors for clarification and
to request raw data but did not receive a response, and therefore
excluded this data from our meta-analysis. Although the published
paper did not state whether there was a statistically significant dif-
ference in frequency of each NIPS score between the breastfeeding
and control groups, 6 of the 60 infants (10%) in the breastfeeding
group scored the highest NIPS scores of 5 to 7, whereas 12 of the
60 infants (20%) in the control group scored the highest NIPS
scores.
We pooled NIPS scores during immunisation for meta-analysis
from three studies enrolling 174 infants (Dilli 2009; Esfahani
2013; Thomas 2011). Esfahani 2013 included three groups
(breastfeeding, massage, and control), but we included only breast-
feeding and control in the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis results
showed a significant reduction in mean NIPS scores in the breast-
feeding group compared to control (MD -1.9, 95% CI -2.5 to -
1.2; P = 0.04). There was moderate between-study heterogeneity
(I2 = 69%) (Analysis 1.3; Figure 6).

 Figure 6.
Forest plot of comparison: 1 Breastfeeding versus control, outcome: 1.3 NIPS.
We judged the quality of the evidence according to the GRADE
criteria, for breastfeeding during vaccinations, on the outcome of
the behavioural pain score NIPS, to be moderate. Most of the in-
cluded infants were younger than 6 months of age, and outcomes
may be different for older infants during their 12-month immu-
nisation.
Breastfeeding versus control: heart rate
One study measured heart rate during immunisation (Efe 2007).
Based on 66 infants, there was no statistically significant differ-
ence in mean heart rate. Heart rate following completion of the
injections was measured by Efe 2007 (N = 66) and Razek 2009
(N = 120). We pooled data for heart rate following the procedure
and found no statistically significant differences (MD -4, 95% CI
-23 to 16; P = 0.03) (Analysis 1.4). There was high heterogeneity
(I2 = 78%).
As we could pool results for only two studies, we judged the quality
of the evidence according to the GRADE criteria, for breastfeeding
during vaccinations, on the outcome of heart rate differences, to
be low.
Breastfeeding versus control: oxygen saturation
One study measured oxygen saturation during and after immuni-
sation (Efe 2007). There was no statistically significant difference
in mean oxygen saturation during or following completion of the
injection.
As only one study measured oxygen saturation, we judged the
quality of the evidence to be very low.
Breastfeeding versus control: MBPS
One study of 76 infants reported MBPS scores 5 seconds before
the injection and 15 seconds after the injection (Taavoni 2009a).
There was no significant difference in MBPS scores for the breast-
feeding group 5 seconds before the injection, however breastfeed-
ing resulted in a statistically significant mean reduction of MBPS
of 3.8 in the 15 seconds following the injection procedure.
As only one study measured the MBPS, we judged the quality of
the evidence to be very low.
Comparisons of breastfeeding with other
interventions
Four studies had more than two study arms (Boroumandfar 2013;
Esfahani 2013; Goswami 2013; Gupta 2013). Our summaries of
the results for these additional arms are as follows.
Breastfeeding versus 25% dextrose versus water: MFCS and
cry duration
Goswami 2013 included three study arms: breastfeeding, water,
and 25% dextrose. MFCS data were presented in graphical form
only and therefore could not be extracted. The authors reported a
significant reduction in MFCS for infants who were breastfed or
given 25% dextrose compared to water at 1 minute and 3 minutes
after needle insertion. Breastfeeding resulted in a significantly re-
duced cry time compared to 25% dextrose and compared to water.
Breastfeeding with EMLA versus control with EMLA versus
no intervention: MFCS and cry duration
Gupta 2013 reported MFCS scores and crying characteristics for
three groups: EMLA combined with breastfeeding, EMLA com-
bined with water, and placebo cream combined with water. The
combination of EMLA and breastfeeding resulted in a statistically
significant reduction in MFCS pain scores at 1 minute and 3 min-
utes following the vaccinations compared to EMLA and water. In
addition, the combination of breastfeeding and EMLA resulted
in significantly shorter crying duration compared to both EMLA
and water, and placebo cream and water.
Breastfeeding versus vapocoolant versus water: NIPS scores
> 3
Boroumandfar 2013 included three study arms: breastfeeding, wa-
ter and vapocoolant. They classified NIPS pain scores of greater
than 3 as “pain”. The number and proportion of babies allocated
a score of “pain” were lowest in the breastfeeding group compared
to vapocoolant and water (P < 0.001): breastfeeding: n = 17/48
(35%); vapocoolant: n = 36/48 (75%); and control (water): n =
48/48 (100%).

 Breastfeeding versus massage with maternal hugging versus
maternal hugging only (control): NIPS scores
Esfahani 2013 reported that the mean (standard deviation) of
NIPS in the breastfeeding, massage combined with maternal hug-
ging, and maternal hugging only (control) groups were 3.4 (0.83),
3.9 (1.0), and 4.8 (1.1), respectively. The difference between
breastfeeding and massage combined with maternal hugging was
statistically significant (P = 0.04), and the differences between both
interventions compared to the control were statistically significant
(breastfeeding compared to control: P < 0.001; massage with ma-
ternal hugging compared to control: P = 0.002).
Secondary outcomes and subgroup analyses
None of the included studies reported adverse effects such as chok-
ing, gagging, spitting, coughing, aspiration, or cyanosis. Only Dilli
2009 reported the number of infants coming off the breast during
the procedure, stating that 4 of the 158 infants (2.5%) failed to
complete the study as they did not resume feeding.
We were unable to conduct planned subgroup analyses based on
age of the infants at the time of study as data were not reported
separately for the different ages. Importantly, however, only two
studies included infants up to 12 months of age. Esfahani 2013
included infants at 6 and 12 months of age, and Razek 2009
included infants from 1 month to 12 months of age.

Summary of main results
This systematic review of RCTs or quasi-RCTs evaluating breast-
feeding for procedural-pain reduction in infants aged 1 to 12
months included 10 trials. All trials evaluated breastfeeding dur-
ing early childhood vaccination, with nine of the 10 evaluating
breastfeeding during a single injection. Results showed that breast-
feeding was associated with statistically significant reductions in
cry duration and composite pain scores (NIPS, NFCS, MFCS,
MBPS, Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale) compared to no
treatment or water. Breastfeeding was not associated with a statis-
tically significant reduction in physiological responses of heart rate
or oxygen saturation levels. Breastfeeding was more effective in re-
ducing pain than other interventions including massage combined
with maternal hugging, maternal hugging alone, topical vapoc-
oolant, topical anaesthetic cream (EMLA), and 25% dextrose.
Outcome measures differed across the studies, however we were
able to pool results for meta-analysis for crying duration in seconds
forsixstudies.Resultsshowedastatisticallysignificantreductionin
cry duration of 38 seconds associated with breastfeeding compared
to control. We were also able to conduct a meta-analysis using
standardised mean pain scores, pooled from five studies. Based on
a pain score range of 0 to 10, with 10 being the maximum pain
score, breastfeeding was associated with a statistically significant
reduction in pain scores of -1.73.
Only two studies reported physiological responses of heart rate
following the vaccination procedure (Efe 2007; Razek 2009). A
meta-analysis of these pooled data for 186 infants showed a non-
significant reduction of 3.6 beats/min, with a wide 95% CI of -
23.17 to 16.05 beats/min. Only Efe 2007 reported oxygen satu-
ration changes, and showed no differences between study groups.
No study reported any adverse outcomes. In addition, no study
reported on acceptability of breastfeeding, from the perspectives
of mothers or healthcare providers, and no studies reported on the
logistics of facilitating breastfeeding in the clinical settings. Only
one study reported on infants failing to continue breastfeeding
after the vaccination Dilli 2009, and this applied to only a small
number of infants.
Eight of the 10 trials included infants aged 1 to 6 months, with
only 2 studies including older infants up to 1 year of age (Esfahani
2013; Razek 2009). We could not conduct any subgroup analyses
by age, as the study outcomes were not reported in sufficient detail
to be extracted for pooling, or data differed. For example, Razek
2009 reported means and standard deviations of cry duration,
and Esfahani 2013 reported means and standard deviations of
NIPS scores. However, individual results of these two studies were
consistentwith the overall results, showingastatisticallysignificant
reduction in behavioural pain responses.
Breastfeeding effectively reduces needle-pain during vaccinations,
based on reduced crying and pain scores. If mothers are breastfeed-
ing, then breastfeeding is free during vaccinations. Its use is there-
fore recommended during early childhood vaccinations. Breast-
feeding mothers are encouraged to advocate for their infants and
request to breastfeed before and during early childhood vaccina-
tions.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
All 10 studies in this systematic review reported that breastfeed-
ing reduced behavioural responses to pain during vaccination in-
jections in infants beyond the newborn period compared to no
treatment or control conditions. These consistent findings across
diverse settings globally (Iran (n = 3); India (n = 2); Turkey (n =
2), Jordan (n = 1); Canada (n = 1)) highlights the applicability of
the evidence and the generalisability of the findings.
Eight of the 10 studies in this review assessed the analgesic effects
of breastfeeding prior to and during earlychildhood vaccination in
infants aged 1 to 12 months during single-vaccination procedures;
one study evaluated breastfeeding during multiple injections in a
single consultation (Dilli 2009), and one study evaluated effects
at two time points, a two-month and a four-month vaccination
(Barr 2001). We can conclude that the results of this review are ap-
plicable to large populations of infants requiring early childhood
20

 immunisation. If the mother is breastfeeding, then breastfeeding
infants during vaccinations and other non-urgent painful proce-
dures should be promoted and supported where feasible. Potential
benefits of breastfeeding during painful procedures, in addition
to pain reduction for the infant, include the possibility that this
may further encourage mothers to continue to breastfeed, and em-
power the mother through her knowledge that she can effectively
reduce her baby’s distress during a painful procedure. However, if
the mother did not establish breastfeeding, or had ceased to breast-
feed by the time of early childhood vaccinations, or breastfeed-
ing during vaccinations is simply not possible, sucrose or glucose
with or without a pacifier can be recommended for pain treatment
(Harrison 2010a; Harrison 2010c).
Quality of the evidence
All studies scored high risk of bias for blinding of participants and
personnel, and all studies except for one scored high risk of bias
for blinding of outcome assessment, highlighting the challenges in
conducting research evaluating breastfeeding for procedural-pain
treatment. Based on the Cochrane PaPaS guidance on sample size,
we scored nine of the 10 included studies as high risk of bias, as
there were fewer than 50 participants per arm. However, three of
these nine studies that included fewer than 50 participants per arm
reported their a priori power calculation to inform their sample
size.
Most studies scored low risk of bias for incomplete outcome data
and other bias, while results were variable for random sequence
generationandallocationconcealment. We were unable to identify
completed protocols for most studies, therefore we predominantly
gave a risk of bias rating of unclear for selective reporting bias.
For behavioural responses of crying time and standardised pain
scores, the overall evidence based on GRADE was moderate. As
most studies (8 out of 10) included infants in the younger age spec-
trum, of 1 to 6 months, further research including older infants
up to 12 months of age may have an important impact on our
confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.
As we could only pool heart rate data for two studies, evidence for
physiological outcomes based on GRADE was considered to be
low quality, and further research is very likely to have an important
impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to
change the estimate.
Potential biases in the review process
There were no known potential biases in the review process. We
performed extensive searches of the literature with no language
restrictions, and attempted to contact authors for additional in-
formation where required.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
In terms of effects of breastfeeding on behavioural responses to
pain, these review findings agree with the systematic review of
breastfeeding for procedural pain in newborn infants (Shah 2012),
and a recently published systematic review of interventions to re-
duce vaccine pain that included infants and children (Shah 2015).
In all three systematic reviews, breastfeeding resulted in a statisti-
cally significant reduction in behavioural parameters and compos-
ite pain scores. However, in this current systematic review, there
were no consistent effects on physiological parameters of heart
rate and oxygen saturation levels. This finding disagrees with the
Cochrane systematic review of breastfeeding for procedural pain in
neonates (Shah 2012), in which breastfeeding reduced heart rate
change from baseline compared to being held by the mother, suck-
ing on a pacifier, sucrose, or simply positioned supine or prone.
Both Shah 2012 and this current review included one study that
compared breastfeeding with small volumes of sweet solutions.
Results of both reviews showed that breastfeeding was associated
with reduced behavioural responses to pain compared to sweet so-
lutions. In pain studies, a difference of at least 13% is considered
by parents of newborn infants to be clinically important, and a
difference of 19% is considered by nurses to be important (Shah
2004). The 1.75 difference in pain scores out of a possible stan-
dardised score of 10 is 17.5%, therefore well within the range of
what parents consider to be important, and just under what nurses
in general consider to be important.
Our findings in this review are also consistent with that of the sys-
tematic review of skin-to-skin care for procedural pain in neonates
(Johnston 2014); both reviews demonstrated that maternal care
resulted in a statistically significant difference in composite pain
scores immediately and within 90 seconds after completion of the
painful procedures compared to no treatment, yet there were in-
consistencies in physiological responses of heart rate and oxygen
saturation levels. To our knowledge, there are no studies evaluating
skin-to-skin care in infants beyond the neonatal period, and there
are only three studies that included full-term newborn infants in
the systematic review of skin-to-skin care for procedural pain in
neonates (Johnston 2014). We are therefore unable to make a di-
rect comparison of analgesic effects of breastfeeding and skin-to-
skin care in the age group of 1 to 12 months.
Adverse outcomes were not reported in any of the trials included
in this review, or in the systematic review of breastfeeding for
procedural pain in neonates (Shah 2012). This suggests that there
are no adverse outcomes such as airway compromise including
coughing, choking, gagging, or aspiration. However, the inclusion
of adverse events as an outcome measure and clear reporting of the
same in future studies of breastfeeding all populations of infants
and young children during painful procedures is recommended.
In this review, we identified no studies comparing formula feeding
or bottle feeding expressed breast milk with breastfeeding. Shah
2012 included one such study in their systematic review of breast-
21

 feeding for procedural pain in neonates (Weissman 2009), which
showed that formula feeding was as effective as breastfeeding in re-
ducing behavioural and physiological responses during heel lance.
Breastfeeding is now recommended by the World Health Organi-
zation (WHO) for pain management for infants (World Health
Organization 2015). Although previous studies have shown that
breastfeeding is infrequently used for vaccination pain manage-
ment (Lisi 2013; Russell 2015; Taddio 2009), the global recom-
mendations made by WHO, alongside the additional evidence of
pain management effectiveness provided in this systematic review,
may lead to more consistent adoption of this strategy in diverse
settings where vaccinations take place.

Implications for practice
We included 10 studies enrolling 1066 infants in this review, all
of which examined pain associated with early childhood vacci-
nations. Breastfeeding consistently reduced behavioural responses
of cry duration and composite pain scores during and following
vaccinations compared to no treatment, oral water, oral dextrose,
maternal cuddling, massage, vapocoolant spray, and topical anaes-
thetic (EMLA). We saw no additional benefit of adjunct EMLA
or vapocoolant. However, there was evidence that breastfeeding
did not impact on physiological responses.
No studies included populations of hospitalised infants under-
going other skin-breaking procedures. Further studies of efficacy,
feasibility, and acceptability in this population are warranted. No
adverse effects of breastfeeding for procedural pain have been re-
ported in this current review.
Implications for research
General
Infants’ distress during early childhood vaccinations is common
and can lead to long-term fear of needles and parents’ reluctance
to adhere to recommended immunisation schedules. The avail-
able evidence suggests that breastfeeding may help reduce pain in
healthy infants beyond the newborn period, especially up to six
months of age, during early childhood immunisation. Additional
research gaps include evaluating the effectiveness of breastfeeding
throughout multiple injections during a vaccination episode, in-
cluding the rate of success of re-attaching the infant to the breast
following repositioning for subsequent vaccinations.
Only two studies in this review included infants up to one year of
age, however the overall results of these studies showed analgesic
effects of breastfeeding during vaccination. Further research in this
upper age limit of infancy and into early childhood is therefore
warranted.
Design
The design and implementation of studies could be improved,
although breastfeeding as an intervention cannot be blinded.
No studies in this review included hospitalised infants. It is there-
fore uncertain if we can extrapolate the results to sick hospi-
talised infants undergoing painful procedures. Pilot randomised
controlled trials or observational studies to establish feasibility, ac-
ceptability, and safety for hospitalised infants who are medically
stable, able to breastfeed, and undergoing blood work or insertion
of intravenous lines are warranted to inform research and practice.
None of the included trials reported on acceptability of breastfeed-
ing from the perspective of mothers or healthcare providers, and
ways to facilitate breastfeeding in the clinical settings. Inclusion
of these factors in future research is recommended.
Measurement (endpoints)
Further trials and observational studies should include adverse
events as an outcome measure, and clearly report the results. If no
adverse events are observed, this should be stated.
In addition, observational and longitudinal studies are warranted
that follow up babies who have consistently received recom-
mended pain management during vaccinations.
Other
Quality improvement research aimed at increasing the use of
breastfeeding for healthy and medically stable hospitalised infants
during non-urgent painful procedures in diverse settings is war-
ranted. Similarly, knowledge translation research aimed at explor-
ing the most effective ways to improve implementation of effective
pain treatment for infants is recommended.

Denise Harrison (DH) oversaw the entire process of conducting the systematic review. In addition, DH arbitrated if required when
there were disagreements relating to data collection, data extraction, and ’Risk of bias’ ratings. All authors assisted in the conduct of the
systematic review. Jessica Reszel (JR) and Mariana Bueno (MB) were primarily responsible for reviewing and rating articles. Catherine
Larocque (CL) supported all aspects of organizing and entering data, supporting data analysis and reviewing and editing draft versions.
Lucy Turner (LT) served as the methodological expert. Margaret Sampson (MS) developed the search strategies. Vibhuti Shah (VSS)
and Anna Taddio (AT) provided clinical, methodological and editing expertise throughout the entire process.

We had stated in our protocol that we would exclude quasi-randomised controlled trials using a non-random process (e.g. odd or even
date of birth; hospital or clinic record number). However, we revised this exclusion, and included all such studies.
In addition, in our protocol we stated that we would use the Oxford Quality Score as the basis for inclusion ( Jadad 1996), limiting
inclusion to studies that were randomised and double-blind as a minimum. We did not use this, as the blinding of breastfeeding is not
possible.
N O T E S
A restricted search in June 2018 did not identify any potentially relevant studies likely to change the conclusions. Therefore this review
will be reassessed for updating in two years. If appropriate, we will update the review before this date if new evidence likely to change
the conclusions is published, or if standards change substantially which necessitate major revisions.
