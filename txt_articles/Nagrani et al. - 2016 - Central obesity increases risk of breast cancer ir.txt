Abstract
Background: Current evidence suggests that the relationship between obesity and
breast cancer (BC) risk may vary between ethnic groups.
Methods: A total of 1633 BC cases and 1504 controls were enrolled in hospital-based case
econtrol study in Mumbai, India, from 2009 to 2013. Along with detailed questionnaire,
we collected anthropometric measurements on all participants. We used unconditional logistic
regression models to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for BC risk
associated with anthropometry measurements, stratified on tumour subtype and menopausal
status.
Results: Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) of �0.95 was strongly associated with risk of BC
compared to WHR �0.84 in both premenopausal (OR Z 4.3; 95% CI: 2.9e6.3) and postmen-
opausal women (OR Z 3.4; 95% CI: 2.4e4.8) after adjustment for body mass index (BMI).
Premenopausal women with a BMI �30 were at lower risk compared to women with normal
BMI (OR Z 0.5; 95% CI: 0.4e0.8). A similar protective effect was observed in women who
were postmenopausal for <10 years (OR Z 0.6; 95% CI: 0.4e0.9) but not in women who were
postmenopausal for �10 years (OR Z 1.8; 95% CI: 1.1e3.3). Overweight and obese women
(BMI: 25e29.9 and � 30 kg/m2, respectively) were at increased BC risk irrespective of

1. Introduction
Recent trends have shown marked increase in breast
cancer (BC) incidence in India, with a larger increase in
postmenopausal compared to premenopausal women
[1]. A potential explanation for this increase could be
changing patterns of lifestyle factors as a result of
rapid economic transition. In the last two decades,
levels of physical activity have reduced, and food pat-
terns have changed, leading to an increase in the
average population body mass index (BMI) [2]. The
prevalence of central obesity is particularly high in
Indian population; and Indians are reported to have a
higher body fat percentage than Caucasians for the
same BMI [3].
Higher (�30 kg/m2) BMI has been consistently
associated with increased risk of postmenopausal BC [4]
but decreased risk of premenopausal BC in Caucasian
and Asian populations [5]. Central obesity has been
associated with increased risk of BC in postmenopausal
women [6], but its effect on premenopausal BC seems to
vary according to ethnic status. Markers of central
obesity such as waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) appear to
show strong positive association for premenopausal
Asian women, but smaller (increased risk of lower
magnitude) for African and Caucasian women [6]. The
studies from Asia too have largely been limited to
Japan, China, Taiwan and Thailand [6].
We performed a caseecontrol study at the Tata
Memorial Hospital (TMH), Mumbai, India, to evaluate
the risk of premenopausal and postmenopausal BC in
relation to different measures of body fatness (BMI, WC
and WHR) stratified on hormone receptor (HR) status
in a population which has not been exposed to hormone
replacement therapy and has not undergone systematic
community screening for BC.
2. Material and methods
We conducted a hospital-based caseecontrol study at
TMH between January 2009 and September 2013. A
total number of 1659 premenopausal (818 cases and
841 visitor controls) and 1478 postmenopausal women
(815 cases and 663 visitor controls) were enrolled
during the study period. The information on HR sta-
tus,
i.e.,
oestrogen
receptor
(ER),
progesterone
receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor re-
ceptor 2 (HER2) was available on 1294 (79.0%) BC
cases. The premenopausal and postmenopausal BC
cases were further stratified into oestrogen receptor
positive/progesterone receptor positive (ERþ/PRþ),
oestrogen
receptor
negative/progesterone
receptor
negative (ERe/PRe) and triple negative breast cancer
(TNBC). The study has been approved by TMH
Institutional Review Board.
2.1. Selection of cases
The cases were female BC patients coming to TMH.
Only primary histologically confirmed BC cases aged
20e69 years were enrolled in the study with date of
diagnosis not more than 6 months from the date of
interview.
2.2. Selection of controls
All female visitors with no history of cancer coming
along with any site cancer patient (e.g. breast, head
and neck, thoracic, urology, gynaecology, etc) aged
20e69 years were included in the study. Controls were
frequency matched to cases on age (�10 years) and
region of residence (northern, western, central, south-
ern and eastern India) at the time of enrolment.
Eligible study participants were enrolled simulta-
neously during the study period. Forty percent of the
controls enrolled in the study were first degree relatives
(mother, sister or daughter) from various disease
management groups (DMGs). The remaining were
other relatives, friends and neighbours of different
cancer site patients. The detail of questionnaire and
study
methodology
has
been
mentioned
in
Supplementary Document.
2.3. Quality control
Data were checked at three levels (one by interviewer,
study co-ordinator and data entry operator) and entered
twice onto the software. We obtained over 90% corre-
lation on all the variables collected on an abbreviated
reproducibility questionnaire.

 2.4. Exposure assessment
Menopausal status was assessed with the help of ques-
tionnaire. A woman was considered postmenopausal if
the study participant responded that menstruation had
stopped for more than 6 months at the time of interview.
ER, PR and HER2 status were obtained from hospital
pathology records.
The details of anthropometric measurements have been
explained earlier [7]. WHR was calculated as waist
circumference (WC) (in cm) divided by hip circumference
(HC) (in cm) and grouped into three categories. BMI (kg/
m2) was calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by the
square of height (in m2). Postmenopausal women were
divided into two groups for analysis of BMI: those who
were postmenopausal for <10 years and those who were
postmenopausal for �10 years at the time of enrolment.
This stratification of postmenopausal women is in accor-
dance with Pike et al. [8] who mentioned that menopausal
transition shifts BMI from a protective factor to a risk
factor of BC in almost a decade. We showed body size
pictograms to all the study participants as depicted in
Fig. 1 to mention their body sizes at three stages of life, i.e.,
age 10, 20 and at the time of enrolment. Body size picto-
grams at each stage were categorised into <3 (reference),
3e4, and �5 as per Fig. 1. Using the pictogram, increase in
body size was estimated at two stages, i.e., from age 10 to
20 years and from age 20 to age at the time of enrolment.
Each was categorised into no increase (reference), mod-
erate increase and drastic increase. No increase was
defined when the body size of the study participant
remained between 1 and 2. Moderate increase was defined
when the body size of the study participant increased from
1e2 to 3e4. Drastic increase was defined when the body
size of the study participant increased from 1e2 to 5e9.
2.5. Statistical analysis
Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence
interval (CI) [9] were estimated for developing BC
stratified on menopausal and HR status in relation to
anthropometric
factors.
Unconditional
logistic
regression models were adjusted for potential con-
founders. To test for linear trends across quintiles, we
assigned ordinal values to each quintile group and re-
ported ptrend values. The sample size of 3000 (1500 cases
and 1500 controls) was sufficient to detect an OR of 1.20
for risk factors having prevalence around 20% with 80%
power based on assumed alpha level of 0.05. All ana-
lyses were performed using Stata version 12 [10].
3. Results
Study participants were enrolled from all regions of
India with majority of participants residing in western
parts of the country having 48.4% premenopausal and
51.7% postmenopausal BC cases (Table 1).
The risk of developing BC in relation to BMI has
been shown in Fig. 2. An increased risk of BC was
observed
for
premenopausal
and
postmenopausal
women with lower BMI (<18.5 kg/m2) compared to
women with normal BMI (18.5e24.9 kg/m2), even after
adjustment for WHR. BMI of �30 kg/m2 appeared to
be
protective
for
BC
in
premenopausal
women
compared to women with normal BMI with or without
adjustment for WHR. When stratified by time of
menopause, a decrease in BC risk (OR Z 0.6; 95% CI:
0.39e0.91) was observed in women who were post-
menopausal for <10 years, while BC risk increased in
women with history of menopause for �10 years from
enrolment in the study (OR Z 1.8; 95% CI: 1.05e3.28),
after adjustment for WHR (Supplementary Table 1).
Risks for developing BC in relation to various other
anthropometric measurements and body size at different
ages are tabulated in Table 2. Increased risk of BC with
larger WC was observed in both premenopausal and
postmenopausal women. WHR �0.95 was strongly
associated with increased risk in both premenopausal
(OR Z 4.3; 95% CI: 2.90e6.31) and postmenopausal
women (OR Z 3.4; 95% CI: 2.39e4.79) compared to
WHR �0.84 which remained statistically significant
even after adjustment for WC (data not shown). Larger
body size at age 20 years (�5 versus <3) increased risk
of premenopausal BC. Any increase in body size from

 age 10 to 20 years using pictogram was associated with
increased risk in premenopausal BCs (OR Z 1.4; 95%
CI: 1.01e1.92).
Table 3 showed that WHR �0.95 increased risk of
ERþ/PR þ BC (ORpre Z 3.71, 95% CI: 2.24e6.14;
ORpost Z 3.92, 95% CI: 2.45e6.27) and ERe/PR e BC
(ORpre Z 5.41, 95% CI: 3.40e8.60; ORpost Z 3.74, 95%
CI: 2.40e5.81) compared to WHR �0.84.
Fig. 3 summarises the results of risk associated with
BMI stratified on WHR for premenopausal and post-
menopausal women. Increased risk for overweight and
obese (in terms of BMI) women was observed in the

4. Discussion
In the present study of obesity and BC in South Asian
women, we found that high central obesity (measured by
WHR) was most important risk factor, conferring an
approximately threefold increased risk of BC. Increased
BC risk with central obesity was observed for both
premenopausal and postmenopausal women, even after
adjustment for BMI, and even in women with BMI
�30 kg/m2 in the highest category of WHR (Fig. 3). On
further stratification by menopausal and HR status, the

 increased risk prevailed with central obesity in all strata
irrespective of HR or menopausal status. Our results
indicate that distribution of body fat, rather than BMI,
is more important risk factor for BC in this Asian
population.
The relationship between obesity and BC is complex,
with different ethnic populations showing different
patterns of risk depending on the particular measure of
obesity [6]. These differences may be due to differences
in body fatness (in terms of central obesity). It has been
documented
that
‘differences
in
body
build
and
composition result in different relationship between
BMI and body fat distribution in adult Asians relative
to Caucasians’ [11]. Consistent with other studies
[12,13], we observed higher WC to be associated with an
increased BC risk in both premenopausal and post-
menopausal women.
Compared to other ethnic groups, Asian women have
been previously reported to be associated with an
increased BC risk associated with larger WHR (a mea-
sure of abdominal fat) among premenopausal and
postmenopausal women [14,15], although other studies
have been inconclusive regarding ethnic differences
[16,17]. Our results support the hypothesis of a strong
BC risk associated with central obesity in South Asian
women, showing increased WHR-associated risk among
both premenopausal (OR Z 4.3; 95% CI: 2.9e6.1) and
postmenopausal (OR Z 3.4; 95% CI: 2.4e4.8) women
after adjusting for BMI.
There have been inconsistencies with association of
central obesity (measured in terms of WC and WHR)
and BC when stratified on HR status [18e20]. Few
studies have evaluated the association of WHR and WC
with BC in relation to both menopausal and HR status
[18,21]. We observed an increase in risk of BC with an
increase in central obesity in all tumour subtypes in both
premenopausal and postmenopausal women (Table 3).
This is consistent with the observations of John et al.
[20] in premenopausal women and in other Asian pop-
ulations [18]. Furthermore, the association of central
obesity with increased insulin levels and insulin like
growth factors may stimulate the growth of BC cells
irrespective of ER/PR status [22].
Our results for BMI suggest a protective effect of
higher BMI in premenopausal women, and an increased
BC risk in women who were postmenopausal for �10
years even after adjusting for WHR. No increase in risk of
BC was observed in women who were postmenopausal
for <10 years which could possibly be due to carryover
protective effect from premenopausal women. Pike et al.
have argued that menopausal transition shifts BMI from
a protective factor to a risk factor of BC in almost a
decade. This effect was modelled to demonstrate that it
takes a decade for a BMI of 30 kg/m2 in a premenopausal
woman (at age 50 years, risk ratio [RR] of 0.75) to become
a risk factor (RR of 1.20 at age 62 years) [8].
Given that a large proportion of women with normal
BMI had a high WHR in our control population
Fig. 3. Relation of BMI and breast cancer stratified on menopausal status and waist-to-hip ratio. BMI Z 18.5e24.9 and

 (Supplementary Table 2), BMI may not be a sensitive
marker for obesity in this ethnic population. The increase
in BC risk that we observed in overweight and obese
women for premenopausal and postmenopausal women
among the highest category of WHR suggests that the
protection observed for higher BMI among premeno-
pausal women might be because of higher muscle mass in
younger women. Higher fat as reflected and probably
more accurately measured by WC and WHR increases the
risk for both premenopausal and postmenopausal BC.
Another interesting finding of the current study was
observed association between low BMI and increased
risk of BC irrespective of menopausal status. It is well
known that even at low BMI, Indians are at higher risk
of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic
syndrome [23e25]. Indians with low BMI have higher
central obesity [3,26e28]. Even in this study, 17.6% of
controls with low BMI (<18.5 kg/m2) had higher WHR
(�0.85). Low BMI is associated with undernutrition and
metabolic syndrome [29,30]. The increased risk of low
BMI observed in present study may thus be suggestive
of risk related to metabolic syndrome. Although BC is
not known to be associated with loss of weight, there
may still be a possibility of reverse causality and this
observation requires further replication in a population
of similar background and ethnicity.
We found that height was positively associated with
premenopausal BCs, which is consistent with previous
reports [31,32]. No such increase was observed for
postmenopausal women, possibly due to low prevalence
of taller women in the older cohort [33]. We observed an
increase in risk of BC with increase in body size (using
pictogram) from age 10 to 20 years for premenopausal
women, but not for postmenopausal women, after
adjusting for current BMI. Body size at age 20 years was
associated with an increase in BC risk for premeno-
pausal women (OR Z 1.4; 95% CI: 1.03e1.83) and non-
statistical
significant
increase
for
postmenopausal
women when adjusted for current BMI.
Data on body size evolution and BC risk are limited;
in contrast, an increase in weight has been associated
with BC risk [34]. Most Indian women have low birth
weight and higher weight at age 20 years (as indicated by
pictogram). An increase in body size from age 10 to 20
years is thus indicative of accelerated growth in child-
hood which may result in increased adiposity and insulin
resistance influencing BC risk. The self-reported current
body size pictograms well correlated with measured
BMI (r Z 0.66) in present study. Previous studies have
similarly used the pictograms to assess BC risk [31,35].
However, we cannot completely exclude the possibility
that women might have misrecalled their body size
pictogram at different ages.
The controls were sampled from all DMGs and
included all types of visitors (relatives, friends, neigh-
bour, spouse, etc). As the sampling of controls was done
from the same study base as cases and that non-
responsiveness for study participants was less than 10%,
we believe that findings of the study were not influenced
by selection bias. To ensure quality of data and elimi-
nate differential misclassification interviews were per-
formed similarly in closed room by trained social
workers with quality checking at three levels and 8%
reproducibility for selected variables. Anthropometry
measurements were performed twice by the same set of
trained social workers for all study participants; thus,
even if there was some misclassification, it would have
been small and non-differential.
In conclusion, our study adds to the inconsistent
literature on central obesity and risk of BC in Asian and
particularly Indian women. We observed that higher
WHR and WC were associated with threefold increased
risk of premenopausal and postmenopausal BC. Future
studies of BC should include more accurate measure-
ments of body fatness and central obesity in particular
(e.g. DEXA), possibly by incorporating measures of
inflammatory markers, and focus on the role of nutri-
tion and accelerated growth in teenagers as possible
contenders for BC risk.
