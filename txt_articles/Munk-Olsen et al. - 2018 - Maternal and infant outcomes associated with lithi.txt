Abstract  
 
Background 
Concerns about teratogenicity and offspring complications limit use of lithium in pregnancy. We aimed to 
investigate the association between in-utero lithium exposure and risk of pregnancy complications, delivery 
outcomes, neonatal morbidity and congenital malformations. 
 
Methods 
Meta-analysis of primary data analyzed using a shared protocol. Six study sites participated: Denmark, Canada, 
Netherlands, Sweden, UK, and US, totaling 727 lithium-exposed pregnancies compared to 21,397 reference 
pregnancies in mothers with a mood disorder, but unexposed to lithium. 
 
Main outcome measures included: (1) pregnancy complications, (2) delivery outcomes, (3) neonatal 
readmission to hospital within 28 days of birth, and (4) congenital malformations (major malformations and 
cardiac malformations). Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were generated using 
logistic regression models. Site-specific prevalence rates and ORs were pooled using random-effects meta-
analytic models.    
 
Findings 
Lithium exposure was not associated with any of the pre-defined pregnancy complications or delivery 
outcomes. There was an increased risk for neonatal readmission in lithium exposed (27·5%) versus reference 
group (14·3%) (Pooled aOR1·62; 95% CI: 1·12–2·33). Lithium exposure during first trimester was associated 
with increased risk of major malformations (7·4% versus 4·3%; pooled aOR 1·71, 95% CI: 1·07–2·72). 
Similarly, more lithium exposed children had major cardiac malformations, albeit not stasticially significant 
(2·1% versus 1·6%; pooled aOR 1·54, 95% CI: 0·64–3·70). Limitations in our study include: Serum lithium 
 5 
 
levels were not available, hence no analyses related to dose-response effects could be performed, and residual 
confounding from e.g. substance abuse cannot be ruled out.  
 
Interpretation  
Treatment decisions must weigh the potential for increased risks, considering both effct sizes and the precision 
of the estimates, in particular associated with first-trimester lithium use against its effectiveness at reducing 
relapse.

Introduction  
Lithium is an effective first-line pharmacological treatment for patients with bipolar disorder,1,2 with well-
documented effects in the acute and maintenance phases for both depressive and manic symptoms, as well as in 
suicide risk reduction.1,3,4 Lithium is also used as an adjunctive therapy for patients with unipolar depression,5 
and can reduce affective symptoms in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.6  
 
Bipolar disorder affects ~ 2% of the population,7 including reproductive-age women,8 so knowledge about 
benefits and risks of lithium treatment in pregnancy is essential. Lithium treatment can reduce the risk for 
relapse both in pregnancy and in the postpartum period.9,10 However, concerns about teratogenicity, maternal- 
and offspring complications (e.g., renal or thyroid problems, preterm birth) limit its use. The specific concern 
related to congenital anomalies teratogenicity mainly relates to first-trimester lithium use. Here the embryo is 
most vulnerable to teratogens, as this is the period of organ formation including the heart. In animal studies 
lithium use in early pregnancy has been linked to abnormalities of the central nervous system, heart and blood 
vessels in the exposed fetuses.11,12 In humans, studies have similarly found increased risks of malformations,13-
16 preterm birth and other pregnancy and neonatal complications,13,17-19 while other studies have not.1,20 Most 
previous studies had limited statistical power to detect significant effects, and others were subject to recall bias 
and poor consideration of important confounding variables.20,21  
 
Meta-analyses can improve the precision of estimates regarding the safety of in-utero exposure to lithium by 
increasing sample size. This was done in 2012, where a meta-analysis found that risk of Ebstein’s anomaly was 
not significantly elevated after lithium exposure in pregnancy.20 Importantly however, the authors cautioned 
that the strength of their conclusion was limited by the small number of cardiac malformation cases, and that 
further studies with larger numbers of cases would be needed to establish this result more definitively.  
 
 7 
 
Accordingly, the aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of data from six international cohorts to 
investigate the association between in-utero lithium exposure and risk of a broad set of maternal and perinatal 
outcomes. Definitions of exposures, outcomes, potential confounders, and statistical analyses were harmonized 
across sites a priori using a shared study protocol to reduce heterogeneity and bias. 
 
Methods 
 
Participating cohorts  
This study combined primary data from 6 cohorts using meta-analysis: three population-level register-based 
cohorts in Denmark, Sweden and Ontario, Canada, and three clinical cohorts (i.e., women under psychiatric 
secondary care) from the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. A joint study protocol was 
created prior to dataset creation and analysis, including specific definitions for selection criteria, each included 
variable, and statistical analysis. Each study site obtained local ethical approval. All cohorts comprised 
pregnancies resulting in live-born singleton deliveries from 1997 to 2015, where health-related information was 
available both for the mother and for the infant (Table 1). Pregnancies in which mothers were prescribed known 
teratogenic medications in pregnancy (thalidomide, valproate, retinoids, antineoplastic drugs, misoprostol, and 
methotrexate) were excluded from the analysis. A detailed description of the identification of study population 
and years of inclusion in each study site is presented in eTable 1 in the supplement. 
 
Lithium exposure 
The lithium-exposed group comprised pregnancies with lithium exposure during the index pregnancy. For 
register-based cohorts, lithium exposure during pregnancy was defined as at least two dispensations of lithium 
during pregnancy that were dispensed any time from one month prior to conception until the delivery, or a 
single lithium dispensation during pregnancy when there was at least one other lithium dispensation within six 
months before or after this date. Dispensations of lithium were identified using the Anatomical Therapeutic 
 8 
 
Chemical (ATC) Classification System code N05AN01 in Denmark and Sweden and the corresponding Drug 
Identification Numbers in Ontario, Canada. For clinical cohorts, medical records were used to define lithium 
use during pregnancy. For the lithium-exposed group, we did not require a documented psychiatric diagnosis, as 
non-psychiatric indications for lithium are rare.  
 
For analyses with specific focus on congenital malformations, we were interested in lithium exposure during 
early pregnancy, and we further defined lithium exposure in the first trimester as follows: For register-based 
cohorts: 1) At least two dispensations of lithium in the first trimester (from one month before the date of 
conception to 90 days of gestation); or 2) One dispensation in the first trimester with at least one other 
dispensation within 6 months before or after this date. For clinical cohorts: Medical records were used to define 
lithium use in the first trimester. 
 
 Mood disorder reference group 
The reference group comprised women with a known history of mood disorder (bipolar disorder or major 
depressive disorder) without exposure to lithium from 90 days before pregnancy until the delivery. For register-
based cohorts, maternal mood disorder was defined as at least one inpatient and/or at least two outpatient 
contacts for bipolar disorder (equivalent to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) 
codes F30‒F31) or major depressive disorder (ICD-10 codes F32‒F33) from 2 years prior to the date of 
pregnancy to the delivery date. For clinical cohorts, maternal mood disorder was defined as any medical history 
of bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder before delivery.   
 
Outcomes of interest 
Outcomes of interest were selected based on theoretical risks for general medication exposure in pregnancy and 
prior research on lithium use specifically.13,20 Outcomes were divided into four subcategories: 1) Pregnancy 
complications,  identified in pregnancy or within 42 days after delivery, using hospital-based diagnoses for 
 9 
 
preeclampsia (ICD-10 code O14), diabetes during pregnancy (ICD-10 code O24), fetal distress (ICD-10 code 
O68), and postpartum hemorrhage (ICD-10 code O72); 2) Labour and delivery outcomes, identified in hospital, 
including caesarean section (ICD-10 codes O82 and P03·4; surgical code KMCA), preterm birth (<37 weeks 
gestation), low birth weight (<2500g), and small for gestational age (i.e. a birth weight below the 10th 
percentile of birth weight by gestational age and sex); 3) Neonatal hospital admission to a special care baby unit 
in the first 28 days of life; 4) Congenital malformations excluding chromosomal abnormalities in the child 
diagnosed by age 1 year, including all singular and combined structural defects, syndromes, sequences, and 
associations, such as cardiovascular defects, neural tube defects hypospadias, and epispadias (ICD-10 codes 
Q00‒Q89, excluding minor malformations according to the EUROCAT Guide 1·4).22 Major cardiac 
malformations were defined as atrial and atrioventricular septal defects and Ebstein’s anomaly (ICD-10 codes 
Q20–Q26), but excluding atrial septal defect (ICD-10 code Q21·1) and patent ductus arteriosus (ICD-10 code 
Q25·0) in infants born prior to 37 weeks gestation.22  
 
Statistical analysis  
All study sites performed analyses independently according to a protocol established a priori. The site-specific 
prevalence rates and effect estimates were subsequently sent to Denmark, and combined by applying an 
aggregate level meta-analysis, because individual-level data could not be shared outside most jurisdictions as 
mandated by local ethical committees and regulations. At each site, all outcomes were modeled as binary 
variables (yes/no), and a binary logistic regression model was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) comparing the lithium-exposed group to the reference group. Due to a specific 
concern related to lithium exposure in the first trimester and congenital malformations, we estimated the ORs of 
major malformations and major cardiac malformations comparing lithium exposure in the first trimester group 
to the reference group. Odds ratios were adjusted for maternal age at delivery (in years), primiparity, calendar 
year of birth, and treatment with any other psychotropic medication during pregnancy according to ATC codes 
filed under N05 and N06 excluding N05AN01, from 1-month prior to pregnancy to the delivery (yes/no). Data 
 10 
 
management and analyses were performed using SAS 9·4 (Canada and Sweden), Stata 13·1 (Denmark and 
UK), SPSS 20·0 (The Netherlands), and R package (US). 
 
For the meta-analysis, data from each individual analysis were double entered in EpiData 3·1. The meta-
analysis was performed using Stata 13·1. Site-specific prevalence rates and effect estimates were pooled using 
random-effects meta-analytic models. In random-effects models, the inverse of within-study variation combined 
with the between-study variation was used as the weight. The pooled prevalence rates of individual outcomes 
were computed using the program Metaprop.23 The 95% CIs of pooled prevalence rates were calculated using 
an exact binomial approach. Overall estimates were presented as forest plots with the pooled adjusted ORs 
(aORs) and 95% CIs. Heterogeneity was quantified using the I2 statistic (ranges from 0% to 100%), which 
describes the proportion of variability in the effect sizes attributable to heterogeneity between study sites.  
 
Sensitivity analyses  
To account for possible heterogeneity and estimate the influence of a single cohort on overall estimates, in a 
“leave-one-out approach”, we recalculated the pooled aORs leaving one cohort out of the analyses each time. 
To determine whether results were influenced by the type of data source, we repeated each meta-analysis by 
stratifying based on whether the source of data was register-based or clinical cohort.  
 
We conducted additional sensitivity analyses (post hoc) using Swedish and Danish data only to further explore 
the potential for residual confounding. First, we repeated the primary analyses and further adjusted for marital 
and education status, antiepileptic use during pregnancy (other than valproate as pregnancies exposed to this 
drug were excluded a priori), and treatment with other psychotropic drugs as individual covariates, including 
antidepressants, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines and hypnotics, and psychostimulants. Second, we compared 
outcomes between pregnancies exposed to lithium and those where mothers used lithium before or after, but not 
during, pregnancy. Third, to estimate whether the use of reference group with maternal mood disorder 
 11 
 
represented an appropriate comparison group, we estimated the difference of relative risk of various adverse 
outcomes in lithium exposed children in comparison to two different reference groups: group with maternal 
diagnosis of mood disorder and group with maternal diagnosis of bipolar disorder. 
 
Ethical approval 
Each study site obtained local ethical approval. For meta-analysis, only site-specific aggregated data were 
sent to Denmark, and no personal identifiable information was shared among groups. 
 
Role of the funding source 
All investigators conducted the research independently. The funders had no role in study design and conduct of 
the study; collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of the data; preparation, review, or approval of 
the manuscript; and decision to submit the manuscript for publication. 
 
Results 
A total of 727 lithium-exposed pregnancies were identified (n=557, or 76·6% from register-based cohorts). 
Baseline sample characteristics are presented in Table 1. Women in the lithium exposure group were more 
likely to be older, nulliparous, and to have filled a prescription for a psychotropic medication other than lithium 
during pregnancy, compared to the reference group (N=21,397).  
 
Lithium use during pregnancy was not associated with preeclampsia (pooled prevalence of 1·8% in lithium-
exposed vs. 2·1% in reference group, pooled aOR=0·97, 95% CI: 0·52–1·80), diabetes in pregnancy (6·4% vs. 
5·4%, pooled aOR=1·20, 95% CI: 0·81–1·78), fetal distress (14·1% vs. 13·2%, pooled aOR=1·00, 95% CI: 
0·76–1·32), or postpartum hemorrhage (7·4% vs. 7·1%, pooled aOR=1·28, 95% CI: 0·64–2·57). No differences 
between the lithium-exposed group and the reference group were observed for caesarean section (26·5% vs. 
25·8%, pooled aOR=0·94, 95% CI: 0·66–1·33), preterm birth (13·1% vs. 10·0%, pooled aOR=1·24, 95% CI: 
 12 
 
0·83–1·84), low birth weight (6·4% vs. 7·2%, pooled aOR=0·98, 95% CI: 0·72–1·35), or small for gestational 
age (7·5% vs. 9·3%, pooled aOR=0·90, 95% CI: 0·67–1·21). In-utero lithium exposure was associated with an 
increased risk of neonatal admission to a special care baby unit prior to 28 days of age (27·5% vs. 14·3%, 
pooled aOR=1·62, 95% CI: 1·12–2·33) (Table 2). Forest plots with site-level ORs of these pregnancy 
complications, delivery outcomes and neonatal admission are present in eFigures 1–3 in the Supplement.  
 
There were 51 lithium-exposed children (7·2%) and 856 children from reference group  (4·3%) with major 
malformations diagnosed by one year of age. Lithium exposure was not statistically significantly associated 
with increased odds of major malformation (pooled aOR=1·58; 95% CI: 0·90–2·79), nor major cardiac 
malformations (2·0% vs. 1·6%, pooled aOR=1·31, 95% CI: 0·50–3·47), but statistical heterogeneity was high 
(Table 2).  For example, in Denmark, lithium exposure was associated with both major malformation and major 
cardiac malformation risk, but this association was not observed in data from the other 4 sites (Figure 1a–1b). 
Of 727 lithium exposed children, 654 (90·0%) were exposed to lithium in the first trimester (eTable 2). In total, 
47 children from the lithium exposure in the first trimester group were diagnosed with major malformations and 
16 with major cardiac malformations. Lithium exposure was associated with an increased risk of major 
malformations (7·4% vs. 4·3%, pooled aOR=1·71, 95% CI: 1·07–2·72), but not major cardiac malformations 
(2·1% vs. 1·6%, pooled aOR=1·54, 95% CI: 0·64–3·70) (Figure 1c–1d), in comparison to the reference group 
of mood disorders. Note, that no Ebstein’s anomaly cases were observed in any of the participating study sites.  
 
The “leave-one-out approach” analyses demonstrated an overall stability of the main findings, except for the 
association between lithium exposure in the first trimester and major malformations. This latter relation became 
non-significant when each of Denmark, Sweden, and the USA were left out (eTable 3 in the Supplement). 
Pooled ORs from the register-based cohorts substantially overlapped those of the clinical cohorts, except for 
postpartum hemorrhage, where a strong relation was observed in clinical cohorts (pooled aOR=2·58, 95% CI: 
1·21–5·52) but not in register-based cohorts (pooled aOR=0·79, 95% CI: 0·41–1·51, eTable 4).  
 13 
 
 
Results from additional analyses in a subgroup that included only the Danish and Swedish data were generally 
consistent with those of the main analysis. Adjustments for education status, marriage status, antiepileptic and 
psychotropic medication use during pregnancy did not differ from the main results (eTable 5). When lithium 
exposed pregnancies were compared to pregnancies where women were using lithium before and after 
pregnancy but not during pregnancy, results were also generally consistent with those of the main analysis. 
However, the odds of major malformations was elevated among children exposed to lithium in pregnancy 
(pooled aOR=2·09, 95% CI: 1·10–3·96), although this was not the case specifically for major cardiac 
malformations (pooled aOR=1·28, 95% CI: 0·13–12·39, Table 3). The relative risk of adverse outcomes in 
lithium exposed children were similar when comparing to the reference group with maternal diagnosis of mood 
disorder or to the reference group with maternal diagnosis of bipolar disorder, although the relative risk of 
neonatal readmission was attenuated to null when comparing to the reference group with maternal diagnosis of 
bipolar disorder (eFigure 4). 
 
Discussion 
With combined data from 6 countries using a harmonized protocol, in-utero exposure to lithium was not 
associated with statistically significantly increased risks for any of the pregnancy complications or delivery 
outcomes investigated. Lithium was associated with a significantly increased risk (~1·5 times, 27.5% vs. 
14.3%) for neonatal readmission within four weeks postpartum. We furthermore found that lithium exposure in 
the first trimester specifically was associated with an increased risk of major malformations, but not major 
cardiac malformations, although the latter was studied only among 16 cases. Across our analyses, results were 
robust to the majority of sensitivity analyses, including stratification by study design, a leave-one-out approach, 
and adjustment for additional variables in a sub-cohort including Swedish and Danish data only.  
 
 14 
 
This study has multiple strengths, including improving statistical power and generalizability over previous 
research. Analyses were performed following a shared protocol established a priori to minimize heterogeneity 
related to selection criteria, exposure, outcome and covariate definitions, and statistical methodology. All data 
on lithium exposure were collected from data recorded prior to outcome occurrence, so the risk of recall bias 
was low. The potential for bias related to the analysis was further minimized since each site performed its own 
analyses independently, blind to the results from other sites. Our study also has limitations. First, we chose to 
only include pregnancies ending with live-born children due to lack of information on stillbirths at some study 
sites. If lithium use during pregnancy increases the risk of stillbirths or miscarriage,24 conditioning on live-born 
children could have led to underestimation of adverse effects, so this is a potential study limitation.25 Second, 
even with a large sample size, our study lacks power to study very rare events. This e.g. relates to cardiac 
malformations, with only 16 observed cases, with subsequent limited statistical power. Third, as with all 
observational studies, residual confounding, especially that due to the severity of the underlying maternal 
illness, substance or alcohol abuse, cannot be ruled out.26 Fourth, we examined multiple outcomes, so the 
potential for Type I error and chance findings cannot be excluded. Fifth, we did not use an active comparator 
approach, i.e., we did not directly compare lithium to other medications that are sometimes used for the 
treatment of bipolar disorder. Sixth, no available data on lithium serum levels prevented analyses related to any 
potential dose-response associations, and a relatively wide defined lithium exposure window can lead to 
misclassification of lithium exposure and have biased our results towards the null. Seventh, we cannot rule out 
that less severe adverse outcomes are more likely to be reported and recorded in the lithium-exposed 
pregnancies than in the pregnancies included in our defined reference group, due to a general concern about 
teratogenic effects. However, this would likely bias the results toward finding an effect, which we did not 
observe for most outcomes.  
 
Lithium use was not associated with any of the pre-defined pregnancy complications and adverse delivery 
outcomes in our study. That being said, mental illness itself has been associated with adverse pregnancy 
 15 
 
outcomes including preterm birth and cesarean delivery, regardless of whether women were treated with any 
mood stabilizing medication (i.e., lithium, antiepileptics, and antipsychotic medications, or some combination 
thereof).27 This may explain why previous studies,13,17,18 with less rigorous control for confounding related to 
maternal mental illness, might have observed an increased risk for these outcomes associated with lithium, 
while our study did not. Across our analyses there was an increased risk for neonatal admission within 4 weeks 
in lithium-exposed infants. To our knowledge, this is not an outcome previously investigated for lithium 
exposure and results could be explained through different mechanisms. Lithium withdrawal after birth could 
directly lead to neonatal morbidity requiring admission to a special care baby unit, as could lithium exposure in 
lactation (which is not generally recommended). Furhter, the neonatal morbidity could be explained through the 
underlying maternal disorder (supplement eFigure 4) or be due to increased vigilance towards infants exposed 
to lithium with subsequent detection of neonatal morbidities in these newborns. This will require detailed 
prospective studies to disentangle.   
 
Most prior research on lithium in pregnancy has focused on congenital malformations including Ebstein’s 
anomaly,13,15,16,28 however there were major methodological limitations to previous research. Most data comes 
from small retrospective clinical studies, prone to over-reporting on malformed infants, lack of information on 
exposed children without adverse outcomes and lack of confounder control.29-31 Adding further to the 
complexities of any interpretation, cardiac malformations may be associated with maternal mental illness and 
other related factors in general, rather than with exposure to lithium.29 In our study, comparisons were made to 
pregnancies among women with mental illness, rather than to pregnancies among all women, because at least 
some adverse outcomes in offspring exposed to lithium during pregnancy may stem from factors other than the 
lithium exposure per se. In our first-trimester specific analysis, more neonates in the lithium-exposed group had 
major malformations (7·4%) compared to our mood disorder reference group (4·3%), indicating a statistically 
significant increased risk in the lithium group (pooled OR=1·71, 95% CI: 1·07–2·72). This finding was 
supported by the sensitivity analysis comparing malformation risk in children of women who were prescribed 
 16 
 
lithium during versus around (but not during) pregnancy using Danish and Swedish data, where an increased 
risk of major malformations were detected. Additionally, risk of cardiac malformations in our meta-analysis 
was 2·1% vs. 1·6%, pooled aOR=1·54, 95% CI: 0·64–3·70. In comparison, concern about malformations after 
in-utero exposure to lithium was similarly supported by the results of a recent well-conducted U.S. study on 663 
infants by Patorno et al., where the absolute risk for cardiac malformations (2·4%) was similar to ours (2·1%). 
14 In this study there was a significantly increased risk of overall malformations in newborns exposed to lithium 
in-utero, risk ratio: 1·37 (95% CI: 1·01–1·87), as well as an increased risk of cardiac malformations, risk ratio: 
1·65 (95% CI: 1·02–2·68).14 At this point, an increased risk for malformations associated with lithium exposure 
is suggested and due to the serious complications of these findings this should guide treatment decisions as well 
as future studies. An approach aimed at further pooling evidence across countries/study sites and presented 
results, could in the next years provide the evidence needed to quantify any magnitude of risk associated with 
lithium exposure in pregnancy.  
 
In our study an increased risk for congenital malformations attributable specifically to first-trimester lithium use 
was found, but our results and that of Paterno et al. jointly suggest that the absolute risk of malformations is 
much smaller than reported in earlier studies. Further, we observed an increased risk for hospital admission 
shortly after birth for lithium-exposed infants which requires further study. Overall, treatment decisions must 
weigh the potential for increased risks, considering both the specific effect sizes and the precision of the 
estimates, associated with lithium use in pregnancy and in particular first-trimester against its effectiveness at 
reducing relapse.

a adjusted for maternal age at delivery, primiparity, other psychotropic medication use during pregnancy, and calendar year of birth; b The number of preeclampsia, diabetes 
during pregnancy and postpartum hemorrhage cases were too small to calculate the pooled odds ratio. 
 
Lithium use around pregnancy (N=597): Mothers with lithium treatment within 1) a period from 400 days prior to the beginning of pregnancy (conception) until 122 days prior 
to the beginning of pregnancy, or 2) a period from after childbirth until 280 days after childbirth. Lithium treatment in either period were defined as either A) having least two 
lithium dispensations during the period, or B) one dispensation during the defined period and at least another dispensation within 6 months before or after this date (not 
overlapping pregnancy);  
Lithium exposure group (N=356): Mothers with at least two dispensations of lithium during pregnancy (from one month prior the date of conception to the delivery date), or one 
dispensation during pregnancy with at least one other dispensation within 6 months before or after this date. 
 
Note: As results in Table 3 are based on data from only Denmark and Sweden, the presented pooled N in each category is smaller than the presented pooled N in Table 2, which 
includes data from entire study base from six countries.
