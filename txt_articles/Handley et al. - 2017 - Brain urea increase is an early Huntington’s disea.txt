The neurodegenerative disorder Huntington’s disease (HD) is typ-
ically characterized by extensive loss of striatal neurons and the
midlife onset of debilitating and progressive chorea, dementia,
and psychological disturbance. HD is caused by a CAG repeat ex-
pansion in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene, translating to an elongated
glutamine tract in the huntingtin protein. The pathogenic mecha-
nism resulting in cell dysfunction and death beyond the causative
mutation is not well defined. To further delineate the early mo-
lecular events in HD, we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on
striatal tissue from a cohort of 5-y-old OVT73-line sheep express-
ing a human CAG-expansion HTT cDNA transgene. Our HD OVT73
sheep are a prodromal model and exhibit minimal pathology and
no detectable neuronal loss. We identified significantly increased
levels of the urea transporter SLC14A1 in the OVT73 striatum,
along with other important osmotic regulators. Further investiga-
tion revealed elevated levels of the metabolite urea in the OVT73
striatum and cerebellum, consistent with our recently published
observation of increased urea in postmortem human brain from
HD cases. Extending that finding, we demonstrate that postmor-
tem human brain urea levels are elevated in a larger cohort of HD
cases, including those with low-level neuropathology (Vonsattel
grade 0/1). This elevation indicates increased protein catabolism,
possibly as an alternate energy source given the generalized met-
abolic defect in HD. Increased urea and ammonia levels due to
dysregulation of the urea cycle are known to cause neurologic
impairment. Taken together, our findings indicate that aberrant
urea metabolism could be the primary biochemical disruption ini-
tiating neuropathogenesis in HD.

H
untington’s disease (HD) is a dominantly inherited neuro-
logical disorder typified by chorea, psychological distur-
bance, and dementia. The symptoms progress and result in
premature death, typically 10–15 y after onset. Currently no
available treatment can delay or prevent the onset of HD. The
gene responsible, Huntingtin (HTT), is ubiquitously expressed
and encodes the large and multifunctional huntingtin protein.
The disease-causing mutation is an expanded CAG repeat in
exon 1 of HTT, coding for a glutamine tract within the protein
(1). The disease-causing repeat lower length threshold is 36 units
and is fully penetrant at 40 units and above (2, 3). There is an
inverse correlation between expanded CAG repeat size and age
at onset of symptoms (4–6). Although the mutation is well de-
fined, the pathogenic process is not sufficiently understood to
enable effective treatment. The majority of HD research focuses
on the brain where there is characteristic neuropathology, pri-
marily atrophy of the striatum (7).
Alongside the striking neurological phenotype of HD, there is
a generalized metabolic disruption. HD mutation carriers weigh
less on average than non-HD individuals (8). Weight loss begins
presymptomatically (9, 10), and in symptomatic individuals, en-
ergy expenditure far exceeds that utilized in movement, despite
high calorie intake (11, 12). Metabolic changes have been
identified both systemically and within the central nervous sys-
tem (CNS) that may be responsible for this metabolic phenotype.
Circulating levels of branched chain amino acids are reduced in
HD individuals, and this decline correlates with weight loss (11).
Levels of citrulline were also reportedly elevated in blood from
HD individuals (13), indicating a potential role of the urea cycle,
a critical pathway for clearing ammonia generated through
protein catabolism. Within the CNS, a recent study found altered
levels of amino acids in multiple regions of the postmortem HD
brain as well as increased concentrations of glucose, sorbitol,
fructose, and urea (14). This is in line with an earlier report
describing a reduced rate of glucose utilization in the HD
striatum (15). These studies suggest that metabolic dysfunction
contributes to the neuropathology of HD. Indeed, studies using
Significance
We present evidence for the presymptomatic dysregulation of urea
metabolism in Huntington’s disease (HD). We identified increased
levels of a urea transporter transcript and other osmotic regulators
in the striatum of our prodromal sheep model of HD and a con-
comitant increase in striatal and cerebellar urea. Elevated urea was
also detected in brain tissue from postmortem HD cases, including
cases with low-level cell loss, implying that increased brain urea in
HD is not just a product of end-stage cachexia. Disruption of urea
metabolism is known to cause neurologic impairment and could
initiate neurodegeneration and the symptoms of HD. Our findings
suggest that lowering brain levels of urea and/or ammonia would
be a worthwhile therapeutic target in HD.

 HD patient-derived cell lines have identified CAG repeat length
correlated with changes in the ratio of ATP to ADP (16), im-
plying a direct role of huntingtin in metabolic regulation. It is
unclear how the HD mutation causes these metabolic changes,
particularly in the initiating stages of the disease.
To investigate pathogenesis in the prodromal phase of HD,
before overt clinical signs, our laboratory has developed and
characterized a sheep model of the disease. The transgenic sheep
line OVT73 expresses full-length human huntingtin with a patho-
genic exon 1 glutamine repeat of 73 units, under the regulatory
control of a short human genomic HTT upstream sequence (17).
The OVT73 sheep display some of the neuropathological changes
that occur in HD, including the accumulation of intracellular
huntingtin-positive inclusions (18). An alteration in circadian
rhythm has been observed, a behavioral phenotype consistent with
an early phase in the disease (19). We have also found that levels
of specific metabolites are altered in the OVT73 sheep brain and
liver. In addition, the correlation between specific metabolite pairs
are different, with increased numbers of correlations in the
transgenic animals, indicating that a metabolic defect exists in this
prodromal model (20).
To further investigate early molecular changes in HD, we
undertook a whole genome RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) ex-
periment comparing gene expression profiles in striatal tissue
from OVT73 and control sheep. Specific gene expression dif-
ferences were detected and validated. Reported functions of the
altered genes support the existence of a metabolic defect in the
OVT73 sheep and, specifically, a disturbance of urea handling.
Concurrently, a metabolomics study revealed a very large in-
crease in levels of the metabolite urea that was widespread in
postmortem HD human brain tissue (21). Together with its
precursor ammonia, urea is neurotoxic in excess and could cer-
tainly contribute to HD pathogenesis. Considering the gene ex-
pression changes in the OVT73 sheep and the urea elevation in
HD brain tissue, we further investigated this phenomenon by
quantifying urea in a range of tissues from the OVT73 sheep and
in postmortem brain tissue from a larger sample of HD cases.
A fundamental question addressed in the current study was
whether the urea phenotype is a generalized phenomenon due to
elevated protein catabolism as a consequence of cell death or
reflects a requirement for cellular energy production due to the
observed increased rate of metabolism in HD.
Results
Differential Gene Expression in the OVT73 HD Sheep Striatum. RNA-
seq was performed on ribosomal-depleted total RNA from the
anterior striatum of 5-y-old sheep, and transcripts were analyzed
for differential expression between OVT73 (n = 6) and controls
(n = 6). A fully annotated sheep transcriptome was not available
at the outset of this research, and therefore, analysis initially re-
quired the construction of a de novo sheep transcriptome (de-
scribed in Materials and Methods). During the course of the
analysis, Ensembl gene models derived from the most recent
sheep genome (Ovis aries v3.1) were released and therefore in-
corporated. Differential expression of transcripts was ultimately
determined through two mapping approaches. In one approach,
the experimental RNA-seq reads (50 bp paired-end) were mapped
directly against Ensembl gene models. Comparative analysis
revealed 278 genes and 188 isoforms that were differentially
expressed (q-value < 0.05; refer to Dataset S1). In a second ap-
proach, reads were mapped against a hybrid transcriptome, as-
sembled from RNA-seq reads (100 bp) using Ensembl gene model
mapping and de novo assembly tools. This enabled the quantifi-
cation of an additional 42,653 de novo assembled transcripts, and
comparative analysis revealed 447 genes and 261 isoforms that
were differentially expressed on average between OVT73 and
controls (q-value < 0.05; refer to Dataset S2).
The distribution of expression values (FPKM) for each set of
nominally identified differentially expressed genes was examined
to identify and remove findings due to outliers. To enable bi-
ologically meaningful interpretation, we further restricted the
final datasets to annotated transcripts and removed transcripts
that were clearly poorly mapped upon inspection using the In-
tegrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) browser. This filtering resul-
ted in a final set of 24 genes of interest with apparent differential
expression in the OVT73 sheep striatum; 18 were identified through
the hybrid transcriptome mapping approach and 10 through the
gene models mapping, with four transcripts in common between
the approaches (Table S1).
For validation, the 24 transcripts of interest identified by
RNA-seq were requantified using NanoString nCounter ex-
pression analysis, in the same striatal RNA samples (dorsal-
medial anterior striatum, DM) used to generate the libraries for
sequencing. Ten of the 24 genes analyzed by NanoString quan-
tification were differentially expressed at the nominal signifi-
cance level (Fig. 1A; refer to Datasets S1 and S2 for RNA-seq
data). Eight transcripts had higher expression levels and two had
lower levels in the OVT73 samples on average compared with
controls. The validated transcript with the greatest differential
expression was SLC14A1, which was 2.2-fold higher in the
OVT73 striatum compared with controls (P = 0.01; Fig. 1B).
Three of the up-regulated genes function as solute transporters
(SLC14A1, SLC5A7, and RHCG), while others are involved in
protein binding (ETV5, CBS, ITGB4, and OXTR), cleavage
(CPAMD8), and processing (SIAH3). To investigate possible
functional relationships between the 10 validated genes, we de-
termined the pair-wise correlation coefficient of each gene
pairing and compared OVT73 with controls. Two differential
correlations were detected at the nominal significance level: the
loss of a negative correlation between ITGB4 and RHCG ex-
pression in OVT73 compared with controls (rOVT73 = 0.47 and
rcontrol = −0.93, P = 0.01), and the gain of a positive correlation
between RHCG and SLC14A1 (rOVT73 = 0.90 and rcontrol = −0.29,
P = 0.03) in the OVT73 animals (Fig. 2). Correlation values for all
10 genes are provided in Table S2.
To extend these findings, NanoString nCounter transcript
quantification was also performed on new RNA samples
extracted from a site in the dorsal-lateral (DL) portion of the
anterior striatum from the same animals, adjacent to the RNA-
seq sampling site (Table S1). Of the 24 genes assessed, only
SLC14A1 was differentially expressed in the DL portion of
striatum, where it was 5.4-fold higher on average in OVT73
samples compared with controls (P = 0.01; Fig. 1C). Together, the
RNA-seq and NanoString nCounter data established SLC14A1,
a transmembrane transporter for urea, as a high-priority gene of
interest in the OVT73 sheep.
To determine whether the differential expression of SLC14A1
was potentially more widespread in the OVT73 brain, qRT-PCR
was subsequently performed on RNA from striatum (DM por-
tion), cerebellum, and motor cortex tissue from the same sheep.
Comparing OVT73 and controls, SLC14A1 transcripts were more
than twofold higher in all three brain regions (P ≤ 0.05, Fig. 3A).
Urea Is Elevated in the OVT73 Sheep Striatum and Cerebellum. The
striking difference in brain SLC14A1 expression and its function
as a urea transporter led us to consider possible effects on urea
levels in the OVT73 sheep. Supporting this, in concurrent work, we
identified a profound and anatomically widespread increase in
urea in postmortem human brain tissue from a small number of
HD cases (21). In that study, urea levels were determined by both
mass spectrometry and a biochemical urea assay, with excellent
concordance between methods. We applied the biochemical assay
to quantify urea in brain and peripheral tissues from the same
OVT73 sheep in which SLC14A1 expression was altered. Within
the brain, the concentration of urea in the anterior striatum was

 1.5-fold higher on average in the OVT73 sheep compared with
controls (P = 0.02; Fig. 3B) but did not differ significantly overall
in the other brain regions examined: cerebellum, motor cortex,
and hippocampus (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the sheep striatum
RNA-seq data revealed no significant differences in the expression
of transcripts encoding key enzymes of the urea cycle (Table S3),
with the transcript levels of CPS1 and OTC indicating negligible
expression in all of the sheep samples (Table S3).
As the sheep cohort studied was imbalanced in sexes (refer to
Materials and Methods), we examined for effects of sex on urea
levels. There was no effect of sex on urea concentration in the
striatum or hippocampus. In the cerebellum and motor cortex,
however, ewes had a significantly higher urea concentration than
rams (P = < 0.0001 and 0.02, respectively). Statistically adjusting
for sex in the data from these two tissues revealed a significantly
higher level of urea in the OVT73 cerebellum compared with
controls (P = 0.04) but not in the motor cortex (Table S4). In the
peripheral tissues examined (heart, bladder, kidney, liver, mus-
cle, urine, and serum), there were no transgene-specific differ-
ences in urea concentration (Table S4).
Evidence for Altered Serum Urea in the OVT73 Sheep. Serum is a
readily accessible bio-fluid from live subjects, and biomarkers of
disease identified in serum would be invaluable for the in-
vestigation and treatment of HD. For this reason, we extended
the quantification of serum urea into two larger, single-sex
grazing cohorts of 4-y-old OVT73 sheep. In a cohort of 39 ewes
(23 OVT73, 16 control), serum urea was modestly lower (P = 0.05)

 in the transgenic animals compared with controls (Fig. S1). In a
cohort of 25 rams (13 OVT73, 12 controls), however, serum urea
levels did not differ by transgene status (Fig. S1).
Urea Levels Are Elevated in HD Postmortem Brain Tissue. We pre-
viously reported elevated urea levels in multiple brain regions of
a small number (n = 9) of postmortem HD cases with mixed
(Vonsattel grades 1–4) neuropathology (21). To establish whether
this urea phenotype is a generalizable phenomenon in HD, here
we sought to replicate the finding in a larger cohort. Cerebellum
and cortical (superior frontal gyrus, SFG) samples from 22 post-
mortem HD cases (Vonsattel grades 0–4) and 14 controls were
kindly provided by the Neurological Foundation of New Zealand
Douglas Brain Bank for this purpose (Table S5). Quantification
of urea in this sample cohort using the biochemical urea assay
revealed a significantly higher concentration in HD compared
with controls for both the cerebellum (P = 0.0002; Fig. 4A) and
SFG (P = 0.003, Fig. 4A), with no effect of sex. Pair-wise corre-
lation analysis demonstrated that urea concentration was also
highly correlated between the two tissues (Fig. 4B). For method-
ological validation, urea was quantified in the HD samples using
gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS), with excellent
concordance observed between values obtained by GCMS and the
biochemical assay (r > 0.96, P < 0.0001).
Alongside the new tissue samples assessed, we requantified
urea in cerebellum and SFG tissue from four controls and eight of
the nine HD cases in which we previously reported elevated urea
(ref. 21, refer to Table S5 for details) to validate and extend those
findings. Addition of these sample to the larger cohort (n = 30 HD
and 18 control in total) improved the statistical significance of the
urea elevation in both the HD cerebellum and SFG (P < 0.0001, for
both biochemical assay and GCMS methods; refer to Table S6).
We find no significant relationship of HD case urea levels with
disease allele CAG repeat length, Vonsattel neuropathological grade,
postmortem delay, or age at death in this study (r2 < 0.02, P > 0.05).
Urea and Its Transporter Are Elevated in HD Case Brain Tissue with
Low-Level Pathology. As urea is a product of protein catabolism, it
was considered that the observed elevated levels in HD post-
mortem brain could be the consequence of cell death. To reduce
the likelihood of cell death as a cause for the phenotype, urea
levels were quantified specifically in brain tissue from seven
postmortem HD cases with low levels of pathology and limited
cell death (Vonsattel grade 0/1) and seven matched controls
(Table S7). This analysis included four HD samples and three
non-HD controls examined as part of the previously assessed
mixed-grade cohorts (refer to Table S7 for details). Quantifica-
tion by biochemical assay again demonstrated a significantly
higher urea concentration in the grade 0/1 HD patient cerebel-
lum on average compared with non-HD controls (P = 0.01;
Fig. 5A). Tissue from other brain regions was not available for
further assessment. We also examined the expression of the urea
transporter in this sample cohort. Quantification of SLC14A1 by
qRT-PCR indicated 4.2-fold higher expression on average in the
grade 0/1 HD cerebellum compared with non-HD controls (Fig.
5B), although this trend was not statistically significant (P =
0.14). A polyclonal antibody raised to the urea transporter pro-
tein (UTB) encoded by SLC14A1 was used to measure human
UTB in brain protein homogenates. Western blots demonstrated
a highly specific single band of 42 kDa (Fig. 5D) in the cerebellar
homogenates, and quantification of this band revealed 1.8-fold
higher levels on average of UTB in the grade 0/1 HD cerebellum
compared with controls (P = 0.03; Fig. 5C). Pairwise correlation
analysis revealed no significant relationship between SLC14A1 levels
and the long allele CAG repeat length of HD individuals in this
cohort (r2 = 0.01 P = 0.87). These findings concur with the results
from the OVT73 sheep, which show minimal neuropathology.
Discussion
Although the causative mutation in HD is well defined, the
multifunctionality of the HTT protein and heterogeneity of
symptoms present a significant challenge in defining the gain of
function ultimately responsible for cell dysfunction and neuro-
degeneration. As cell dysfunction is initiated before onset of
symptoms it is likely that an effective therapy would need to be
applied early in the disease process. We must therefore gain a
better understanding of the initiating pathogenic changes. Here
we demonstrate that urea metabolism is disrupted in post-
mortem brain tissue from HD cases and the HD OVT73 sheep
model, with evidence that this begins early in disease develop-
ment, before overt symptoms or significant neuronal loss.
Levels of urea were elevated in a large cohort of postmortem
HD brain samples compared with non-HD control samples. This
finding replicates and extends a recent report by our wider labo-
ratory of elevated urea throughout the brain in a smaller number
of HD samples (21). While only two brain regions (cerebellum and
SFG) were available for analysis in the present study, significantly
elevated urea levels were detected in both regions, supporting the
urea phenotype as a widespread phenomenon in the HD brain.

 Moreover, we found urea levels to be highly correlated between
the brain regions in pairwise analysis. This was remarkable
given that the HD tissues studied were of end-stage disease and
of variable neuropathology (Vonsattel grades 0–4) and indi-
cates that the urea phenotype may be under molecular regu-
lation within individuals.
Urea is the final product of protein catabolism and a critical
osmolyte in the mechanism for concentrating urine (reviewed in
ref. 22). Excessive levels of urea and its nitrogenous precursor
ammonia are neurotoxic, as evidenced by uremic encephalopa-
thy and the urea cycle disorders (UCDs). Uremic encephalopa-
thy typically occurs in patients with renal failure, because of urea
accumulating in the blood and brain. Symptoms range from mild
fatigue and generalized weakness to seizure and coma (reviewed
in ref. 23). In UCDs, genetic variants in specific enzymes cause a
loss of function, resulting in hyperammonemia. UCD manifes-
tations range from lethargy and abnormal behavior such as dis-
ordered sleep and neurological posturing through to acute
psychosis, weight loss, seizure, and coma (reviewed in ref. 24).
Based on the symptom profile of these disorders, the accumu-
lation of urea and/or ammonia in the brain could certainly
contribute to the neuropathology and symptoms of HD. In-
terestingly, widespread elevation of urea has also been reported
in Alzheimer’s disease brain tissue recently (25), suggesting that
urea cycle disruption could also be a unifying pathogenic feature
of neurodegenerative disease. Not all data are in agreement,
however; Green and coworkers (26) identified 3.25-fold lower
levels of urea in the postmortem HD striatum in the first 1H-
NMR metabolomics study of HD tissue. The reasons for this
discrepancy are not immediately clear. However, we are confi-
dent in our data because it was derived through both biochemical
assay and mass spectrometry methodologies with very high
concordance and employed a standard calibration curve made
from an authentic urea standard.
Given that urea is the product of protein catabolism, a fun-
damental question is whether the urea phenotype observed in
the HD brain is due to cell loss in neurodegeneration or a result
of increased protein turnover as part of the underlying disease
process. Regarding the latter, multiple studies report altered amino
acid levels in brain tissue and blood of HD patients and animal
models including the OVT73 sheep (11, 14, 20, 27). This catabolism
is likely to serve as a source of energy, as HD patients appear to be
in deficit based on the observation of weight loss, even in the pre-
symptomatic phase. We also sought to address the possibility that
urea may be a product of cell loss in the neurodegenerative process.
We specifically analyzed postmortem tissue from individuals with
low-level neuropathology or minimal cell loss (Vonsattel neuro-
pathological grade 0/1). We found that urea levels were signifi-
cantly elevated in cerebellar tissue from these cases compared with
controls, implying that the urea phenotype is not likely to be a

Urea and SLC14A1 are elevated in the OVT73 sheep brain. Urea and its transporter SLC14A1 were quantified in brain tissue from 5-y-old sheep, with
comparison between OVT73 (n = 6) and controls (n = 6). (A) Mean urea and SLC14A1 transcript levels in OVT73 and controls are shown for each tissue (back-
transformed from log10 data where appropriate), in addition to the fold difference (OVT73/control) and P value (*P < 0.05; two-way Student’s t test). Urea (nanomole
urea per milligram of protein) was quantified in anterior striatum, cerebellum, motor cortex, and hippocampus, using a biochemical urea assay. The SLC14A1
transcript was quantified by qRT-PCR in cDNA generated from anterior striatum (DM portion), cerebellum, and motor cortex tissue from the same animals. SLC14A1
transcript levels shown are relative to the geometric mean of the most stable reference gene combination for each tissue. NA, not applicable; SEM, standard error of
the mean. (B) Mean urea concentration (nanomole urea per milligram of protein ± SEM) in the OVT73 anterior striatum compared with controls.

 consequence of cell death. We also found no evidence of a re-
lationship between urea levels and neuropathological grade in our
large cohort of HD postmortem brain.
The current study presents evidence of a urea phenotype in
HD. In agreement with the HD postmortem brain analysis, sig-
nificantly elevated postmortem brain urea levels were found in
the transgenic HD sheep model OVT73. The OVT73 sheep is the
only large animal model that expresses full-length mutant (73
glutamines) human huntingtin (17). The OVT73 sheep are con-
sidered a prodromal model system since they display no overt
symptoms of the disease or cell loss (19), despite the presence of
a recognized pathologic correlate, namely huntingtin-positive
aggregates (18), as well as altered metabolite levels (20), and a
circadian rhythm disruption measurable by Global Positioning
System tracking (19). Comparing urea changes in the post-
mortem brains of the prodromal OVT73 sheep model and end-
stage HD individuals, our results also suggest that the urea
phenotype may be progressive. While the elevation of urea in the
brain from postmortem HD cases appears to be widespread (21),
in the OVT73 sheep elevated urea was detected only in the
striatum and the cerebellum (after adjusting for sex), not the
hippocampus or motor cortex. Therefore, the urea phenotype
may begin as a focal effect in the highly metabolically active
striatum but progress to a generalized and widespread effect in
the brain and perhaps other tissues by end-stage disease.
In addition to the striking urea phenotype, we discovered
significantly increased levels of a urea transporter in postmortem
brain tissue from both HD cases and OVT73 sheep. SLC14A1,
which encodes the urea transporter UTB (28–30), was the most
significantly differentially expressed transcript in the RNA-seq
study of the OVT73 sheep striatum. SLC14A1 was subsequently
found to be elevated by >twofold in two subregions of the
OVT73 striatum and in the motor cortex and cerebellum. Our
findings agree with an earlier report by Luthi-Carter and co-
workers (31), who detected SLC14A1 up-regulation in a micro-
array study of the caudate nucleus from postmortem HD cases.
In the present study, SLC14A1 transcript levels were unaltered in
cerebellar tissue from the low-Vonsattel grade HD case cohort;
cerebellum tissue lysates did, however, demonstrate significantly
higher levels of UTB protein in the HD samples. Unfortunately,
this antibody did not detect UTB protein in sheep brain samples,
likely due to a lack of conservation in the epitope sequence.
Nonetheless, taken together, this set of findings provide empir-
ical evidence that the biology of urea transporters is altered in
the HD postmortem brain, in addition to that of urea itself.
While the UTB protein is primarily expressed in erythrocytes,
bladder, and kidney, it is also present in the brain, where it is
expressed mainly in astrocytes (32). Urea transporter expression is
known to respond directly to nitrogen and urea load (33, 34) and
mediates the facilitated diffusion of urea down its concentration
gradient (35, 36). The altered expression of SLC14A1 transcript/UTB
protein is therefore likely to be a direct response to the elevated brain
urea we observed in HD. The accumulation of urea throughout
postmortem HD patient brain tissue suggests that the capacity of the
up-regulated transporter may be overwhelmed in the end-stage dis-
ease. Meanwhile, the accumulation of urea only in the striatum of the
prodromal HD sheep, despite SLC14A1 transcripts being higher in
several regions, may indicate that elevated SLC14A1 expression is
able to compensate for the urea elevation earlier in the disease.
To resolve the mechanism causing the urea phenotype, it is
critical that we identify the origin of the urea that accumulates in
the HD brain. One hypothesis is that excess urea is being pro-
duced in the brain, however literature is conflicting on whether a
urea cycle operates in the brain. Our RNA-seq study on the
OVT73 sheep striatum revealed no altered transcript expression
of enzymes involved in the urea cycle to suggest altered urea
cycle function in the OVT73 sheep brain. In fact, the gene ex-
pression of two enzymes (CPS1 and OTC) critical for ammonia
entry to the urea cycle was absent or negligible in the sheep
striatum. Levels of the key urea cycle metabolites N-acetylglu-
tamate and ornithine are reported to be reduced in the HD brain
despite urea accumulation (14), also arguing against aberrations
in a urea cycle in the brain being the source of the urea.
The primary site of urea production in the body is the liver,
where the urea cycle acts to dispose of toxic ammonia and amine
nitrogen produced through normal metabolic processes. In the

 brain, a partial urea cycle appears to function primarily to dis-
pose of two amino acids, citrulline and arginine, which are sub-
strates of the urea cycle (37–40). Therefore, the urea could be a
product of arginine metabolism. The main metabolic pathway for
disposing of ammonia in the brain is the glutamate–glutamine
cycle operating in astrocytes (41). Due to its instability in post-
mortem tissue and stored blood, ammonia was unable to be
quantified in this study. We did, however, detect a significant 1.5-
fold up-regulation of the transcript RHCG, which encodes an
ammonia transporter (42), in the OVT73 striatum. Levels of
RHCG correlated strongly with SLC14A1 in the OVT73 sheep,
indicating that the expression of these genes may be coregulated
or responding in concert to related stimuli, hence the possible
involvement of ammonia in the urea phenotype. This RHCG–
SLC14A1 correlation was not present in the control animals.
As neurological disorders involving ammonia accumulation (for
example, UCDs) can be well managed by a low-protein diet and
therapies such as sodium phenylbutyrate (43, 44), it is imperative
that we determine whether levels of ammonia are altered in HD
individuals, in addition to those of urea.
As the primary site of urea production in the body is the liver,
it is possible that the urea phenotype observed in the HD brain
could be caused by a systemic metabolic defect. To our knowl-
edge, urea has never been measured in peripheral tissue from
HD patients. We quantified urea in several peripheral tissues
from the OVT73 sheep, including the liver and blood, with no
significant differences detected. However, levels of circulating
urea in sheep are known to respond directly to dietary protein
input, and therefore strict dietary control may be required to
observe peripheral urea changes in the OVT73 sheep, re-
membering that they are a prodromal model. Indeed, this was
highlighted recently by Morton and coworkers (45), who dem-
onstrated a small but statistically significant increase in circu-
lating urea in the OVT73 sheep following dietary control and
hourly blood sampling over a 24-h period. The sheep utilized in
that study were the same as the 4-y-old ram cohort in which
circulating urea was also measured and found to be unaltered in
the present study while under normal grazing conditions.
The study of OVT73 sheep blood by Morton and coworkers
(45) was the first report of elevated circulating urea in HD. They
also identified elevated blood citrulline and arginine, supporting
systemic involvement of a urea cycle defect in HD. Increased
blood citrulline has previously been described in HD cases and
mouse models of HD (13, 46). Chiang et al. (13) first suggested
the dysfunction of cellular processes in the liver as a pathogenic
mechanism in HD, when they reported reduced activity of the
urea cycle enzymes arginosuccinate-lyase, arginosuccinate syn-
thase, and arginase in the liver of R6/2 mice, as well as hyper-
ammonemia. As seen in UCDs, the hyperammonemia and
symptom profile of these mice improved when they were treated

 with a low-protein diet (13). Further studies now also support HD
as a systemic disease, including a breath test showing dysfunction
of liver mitochondria in prodromal HD patients. Moreover, we
have previously described increased levels of fatty acids in the liver
of the same OVT73 sheep in which we now find elevated brain
urea (20).
The corroboration of our finding of elevated urea and its
transporter in the OVT73 sheep and HD human postmortem
brain highlights the validity and utility of the sheep model for
understanding early HD; a similar study of prodromal post-
mortem HD human brain tissue is clearly not feasible. To better
understand urea cycle function in HD and to determine whether
ammonia is the source of the urea, we now plan to measure urea
cycle enzyme activity and urea and ammonia in the liver, blood,
and brain of the OVT73 sheep on a controlled diet.
Further gene expression differences identified and validated in
the OVT73 striatum RNA-seq data included the up-regulation of
SLC5A7 encoding a sodium and chloride ion-dependent channel,
which mediates choline uptake into cells for acetylcholine synthesis
(47), and OXTR encoding a receptor for oxytocin and vasopressin
(48). Notably, vasopressin has direct effects on the uptake of urea by
cells (reviewed in ref. 49), and therefore, the altered expression of
OXTR may be related to the urea phenotype. Regarding SLC5A7,
striatal cholinergic interneurons are a major source of the neuro-
transmitter acetylcholine. In the HD brain, acetylcholine release
and levels of the enzymes that synthesize it are reduced, and this
cholinergic dysfunction is thought to be involved in the early
symptomatology of HD (reviewed in ref. 50). The up-regulation of
SLC5A7 transcript in the OVT73 sheep striatum may therefore
reflect an early disruption to the cholinergic system. Together the
altered expression of solute transporters (SLC14A1, RHCG, and
SLC5A7) and urea is good evidence for a potential alteration in
osmotic regulation in the OVT73 striatum.
The RNA-seq data also revealed increased expression of genes
involved in protein binding (ETV5, CBS, ITGB4, and OXTR),
cleavage (CPAMD8), and processing (SIAH3). Together these
transcriptional differences suggest that protein homeostasis and
interactions in the OVT73 striatum may also be altered. SIAH3
was the most significant differentially expressed gene in the
RNA-seq dataset, being 1.4-fold higher in the transgenic stria-
tum samples. SIAH3 is a ubiquitin E3 protein ligase involved in
ubiquitination of proteins, tagging them for degradation by the pro-
teasome. It is well established that ubiquitin and mutant huntingtin
are colocalized in the protein aggregates that form in HD (51, 52),
implying altered function of the ubiquitin–proteasome system in HD.
Protein aggregates are detected in the OVT73 sheep brain (18, 53),
and the up-regulation of SIAH3 in the OVT73 sheep supports this
process. The up-regulation of CBS also has relevance to pathology in
HD as the enzyme cystathionine-β-synthase encoded by CBS has
been shown to interact directly with the huntingtin protein (54). CBS
catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of cysteine, where cys-
tathionine is formed from homocysteine. In a second step, the cys-
tathionine is converted to cysteine by cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE).
Interestingly, CSE is depleted in HD patient brain tissue and mouse
models of HD, and this is thought to be neurotoxic due to oxidative
stress caused by the loss of cysteine (55). Indeed, N-acetylcysteine has
beneficial effects on motor abnormalities and weight loss in mouse
models of HD (55, 56). In contrast, we have previously reported el-
evated levels of cysteine in the OVT73 sheep cerebellum (20), per-
haps reflecting a compensatory response of the cysteine biosynthesis
pathway in this prodromal disease model.
In summary, this research provides robust evidence of wide-
spread urea elevation in the HD postmortem brain, which occurs
independently of overt neurodegeneration and disease symptoms.
The cause of the urea phenotype in HD requires further in-
vestigation, including its relationship to the mutant huntingtin pro-
tein. We do not yet know what processes can produce and maintain
the high concentration of urea observed in the postmortem HD
brain. What we have observed are early phase processes—for ex-
ample, elevated SLC14A1—potentially as a response to higher levels
of urea or ammonia. One possibility is that urea is being produced via
elevated protein catabolism, because of the increased rate of me-
tabolism or energy requirement in HD. Further research should aim
to discover the source of the elevated urea in HD, particularly con-
cerning the potential involvement of ammonia and a systemic met-
abolic defect. Realizing this could have profound implications for our
fundamental understanding of the molecular basis of HD, and its
treatability, including the potential use of therapies already in use for
disorders with systemic urea phenotypes.
Materials and Methods
Ovine Sample Collection. All animals were maintained at the South Australian
Research and Development Institute (SARDI) in accordance with the SARDI/
PIRSA Animal Ethics Committee (approval nos. 19/02, 04/11, and 2/13).
Necropsy samples were obtained from six nontransgenic controls (two ewes,
four rams) and six OVT73 (three ewes, three rams) sheep aged 5 y, as pre-
viously described (20).
Ovine serum samples used in urea analysis were collected from the 5-y-old
animals on May 23, 2012, a fortnight before necropsy. At the time (winter) ad
libitum pasture was available to the animals. Serum samples from 4-y-old ewe
(23 OVT73, 16 control) and ram (13 OVT73, 12 control) cohorts were col-
lected on February 1, 2013 (summer) when animals were reliant on sup-
plemental feeding as little or no pasture existed. Whole blood was collected
into an EDTA tube, mixed by inversion, and centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at
3,000 g to remove cellular material. Serum aliquots were made into pre-
chilled tubes and stored at −80 °C.
Human Sample Collection. Human brain tissue samples were obtained from
the Neurological Foundation of New Zealand Douglas Human Brain Bank
(Centre for Brain Research, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand).
All procedures in this study were approved by the University of Auckland
Human Participants Ethics Committee, with informed consent from all
families. Fresh frozen tissue blocks were isolated postmortem and frozen as
described previously (57).
For the analysis of cerebellum and SFG from a large cohort of HD cases with
mixed Vonsattel neuropathology grade (1–4), tissue was dissected from
frozen tissue blocks previously isolated from 30 HD cases and 18 age-
matched non-HD controls. Case details are provided in Table S5. For the
analysis of low-Vonsattel neuropathological grade (0–1) HD, ∼20 mg cere-
bellar tissue was dissected from frozen tissue blocks previously isolated from
seven HD cases and seven age-matched non-HD controls. Patient details are
provided in Table S7. All tissue was stored at −80 °C until analysis.
RNA-Seq and Analysis. All RNA-seq was performed by Expression Analysis.
TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Libraries were prepared after the depletion of
ribosomal RNAs using a Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (Illumina), followed by
sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform (Illumina). All bio-
informatic analysis was performed by AgResearch.
RNA-seq was performed on striatal RNA isolated from a cohort of 12 sheep
aged 5 y (six OVT73, six controls) to facilitate differential gene expression
analysis. Total RNA was isolated from ∼30-mg pieces of fresh frozen DM
anterior striatum using an RNeasy mini Kit, as per the manufacturer’s in-
structions (Qiagen). Multiple RNA extractions were made for each animal to
represent the entire DM portion of the anterior striatum, weighing 207 mg
total on average. RNA quality was measured by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer
(Agilent Technologies) and samples with an RNA Integrity (RIN) score >5.0
pooled for each animal. HiSeq2000 sequencing of the 12 prepared TruSeq
Stranded Total RNA Libraries generated a total of 2.3 × 109 50 bp paired-end
reads. Raw sequence data were quality-checked using FastQC (58) with stan-
dard settings. Low-quality regions and artifacts such as sequencing adaptors
were removed using Flexbar (59), reducing the dataset to 2.1 × 109 paired-end
reads for further analysis.
A fully annotated sheep transcriptome was not available at the outset of
this research, and therefore, differential gene expression analysis of the 5-y-
old sheep RNA-seq data initially required the construction of a de novo sheep
transcriptome. To enable the assembly of a de novo transcriptome further,
RNA-seq with longer read lengths (100 bp PE) was performed on RNA isolated
from fetal/neonatal sheep liver and brain. Total RNA was extracted from fresh
frozen brain and liver tissue (∼30 mg) isolated from fetal brain (63 d ges-
tation) and neonate (1 mo old) control and OVT73 sheep using an RNeasy
Lipid Tissue mini kit (Qiagen). RNA was treated with recombinant DNase

 (Ambion DNA-free Kit) and quality-assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bio-
analyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano LabChip kit (Agilent Technologies).
HiSeq2000 sequencing of the liver/brain RNA libraries generated 1.27 × 109
paired-end reads (100 bp). Raw sequence data were quality-checked using
FastQC and cleaned using Flexbar as described for the 5-y-old sheep RNA-seq
dataset. Cleaning reduced the liver/brain RNA-seq dataset to 3.27 × 108 read
pairs, which were subsequently used for mapping and assembly. Reads were
de novo assembled into transcripts using the Trinity suite (60).
During the course of this research, annotated Ensembl gene models be-
came available (Ovis aries v3.1; sheep release 75, feb2014.archive.ensembl.
org/Ovis_aries/Info/Index) and were incorporated into the analysis. Gene
expression in the 5-y-old OVT73 sheep was therefore ultimately assessed by
two approaches. In one approach, the cleaned read pairs (50 bp) were
mapped against the Ensembl gene models using TopHat2 (61) and Cufflinks
(62) resulting in 1.9 × 109 reads mapping to 101,591 genes and 161,371 iso-
forms. In the second approach, cleaned read pairs (50 bp) were again
mapped (TopHat2/Cufflinks) to the existing Ensembl sheep gene models,
with unmapped reads then mapped against the de novo sheep tran-
scriptome. The de novo assembled transcripts that had single read counts of
more than 171 (average mapping count) were then extracted. Of the
extracted de novo transcripts, only those that had less than 90% identity
over 90% of the length of genome-based transcripts were considered new
transcripts and were appended to the genome-based transcripts. This added
42,653 de novo assembled transcripts to the 161,371 genome-based tran-
scripts.

approach
resulted

of

mapping approaches, Cuffdiff2 (63) was subsequently used to identify dif-
ferentially expressed genes and isoforms. Outputs from Cuffdiff2 are pro-
vided in Datasets S1 and S2. Those transcripts with q-values (adjusted P
value) of less than 0.05 were selected for further investigation.
NanoString nCounter Transcript Quantification. For validation purposes, 24 genes
identified as differentially expressed through RNA-seq were requantified using
the nCounter gene expression analysis system (NanoString Technologies).
Custom CodeSet design and nCounter analysis was performed by New Zealand
Genomics Ltd. Two RNA samples were analyzed for each animal: The first was
from the same aliquot used for RNA-seq (DM portion of anterior striatum), and
the second was obtained from an adjacent, DL portion of anterior striatum,
extracted and quality-assessed using the same methodology. Each sample was
assessed in duplicate, and results were averaged for statistical analysis. Tran-
script counts were normalized (nSolver software) against internal positive
control samples and the geometric mean of four reference genes (CANX,
SHMT2, TRIM27, and TRIP11). These four genes were identified as invariant in
the RNA-seq dataset and so were selected to act as reference genes and
quantified by nCounter analysis. CodeSet designs and a full list of gene names
for the 24 target genes and 4 reference genes are provided in Table S8. The
molecular function of validated genes was investigated using GO terms pro-
vided by the Gene Ontology Consortium website www.geneontology.org/.
Urea Quantification. Biochemical quantification of urea was performed using the
Urea Assay Kit (ab83362) as per the manufacturer’s recommendations (Abcam).
Tissue samples were processed as described previously (21). Sample extracts were
assayed in triplicate and background controls assayed in duplicate. Protein
content in each sample lysate was determined by BioRad DC protein assay
(BioRad), and data were presented as nanomole urea per milligram protein.
Quantification of urea by GCMS was performed as described previously
(21) on ∼50 ± 5 mg of cerebellum and SFG tissue from 30 HD cases and
18 non-HD controls (Table S5). A calibration curve consisting of known
concentrations of a synthetic urea analytical standard was used for quanti-
tative estimation of urea in experimental samples, presented as nanomole
urea per kilogram of fresh tissue.
qRT-PCR of SLC14A1 Transcript. SLC14A1 transcript was quantified by RT-qPCR
in anterior striatum (DM portion), cerebellum, and motor cortex from the
5-y-old sheep and in cerebellar tissue from the low neuropathological grade
HD case cohort (Table S7). Sheep anterior striatum RNA was a subsample of
the same aliquot used for RNA-seq analysis and the NanoString nCounter
analysis. RNA from the other tissues was extracted from fresh frozen tissue
(up to 100 mg per sample) using the RNeasy Lipid column kit, as per the
manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen). RNA was treated with recombinant
DNase (Ambion DNA-free kit). Quantification and integrity of DNase-treated
RNA were assessed by Nanodrop (NanoDrop Technologies). Synthesis of
cDNA was performed using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis Super-
Mix Kit (Life Technologies). Reactions containing 1 μL annealing buffer,
27 μM of random pentadecamer primer, and 1 μg of RNA and water to 8 μL
were initially heated to 65 °C for 5 min, after which 10 μL of the reaction mix
and 2 μL of the enzyme mix were added (total reaction volume 20 μL). A
negative reverse transcription control reaction (RTC) was generated using
1 μg RNA pooled from the experimental samples, with the exclusion of
enzyme mix. The reverse transcription reactions were then incubated at
25 °C for 10 min, 50 °C for 50 min, and heat inactivated at 85 °C for 5 min
and diluted and stored at −20 °C until use.
qRT-PCR assays for SLC14A1 and appropriate reference genes were
designed to publicly available gene sequences from the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene) and using the
Roche Universal ProbeLibrary Assay Design Center (https://qpcr.probefinder.com/
organism.jsp). Three reference gene assays were selected for testing in sheep
tissues (CANX, TRIM27, and YWHAZ) and three for human tissue (CANX, SDHA,
and TRIP11). Primer and probe sequences are provided in Table S9. qRT-PCR was
performed using the LightCycler Universal Probe system and the LightCycler 480
(Roche Diagnostics). Each 10 μL qRT-PCR contained 4 μL cDNA and 6 μL of master
mix (0.4 μL of each 5 μM primer, 0.1 μL probe, 5 μL Roche Probes Master, and
0.1 μL water). Reactions were set up using an epMotion 5075 robot (Eppendorf).
Cycling conditions on the LC480 were 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 95 °C for
10 s, 60 °C for 30 s, × 45 cycles, and 40 °C for 40 s. Samples (including RTC and no
template-negative controls) were assayed on a 384-well plate in triplicate.
Standard curves for each assay were generated from a cDNA dilution series (3×–
2,187×) and used to normalize expression values (LightCycler 480 Software Ab-
solute Quantification method). The expression stability of reference gene assays
was assessed using GeNorm and NormFinder software (64, 65). LightCycler 480
Software Relative Quantification method was used to create an expression ratio
for each sample of the target gene compared with the geometric mean of the
reference gene combination considered most stable (refer to Table S9). The
specificity of assays was tested by running PCR products on a 2% agarose gel.
The PCR efficiency for each assay used was calculated as 1.8–2.0 (LightCycler 480
Software Absolute Quantification method).
Western Blot Analysis of UTB Protein. For detection and quantification of UTB
protein, total protein homogenates were prepared and quantified as de-
scribed previously (18), from 50 to 100 mg of cerebellar tissue. Thirty mi-
crograms of protein in 1× Laemmli buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) was loaded per lane
of a 4–15% gradient TGX precast gel (Bio-Rad) and electrophoresed at 200 V
for 1 h, using a Tris–Glycine SDS buffer system (Bio-Rad). Separated protein
was transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore) at 30 mA for 1 h in a tank
transfer system (Bio- Rad) in chilled Tris–Glycine buffer containing 10%
methanol. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk powder in TBST
(10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% vol/vol Tween-20, pH 8.0) for 1 h and
subsequently incubated with the SLC14A1 polyclonal antibody ABIN310975
(Antibodies online) in 5% nonfat milk in TBST overnight at 4 °C, at a 1:
100,000 dilution. Membranes were then incubated in 1:5,000 diluted goat
anti-rabbit IgG-HRP secondary antibody sc-2004 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies)
for at least 2 h. Signal was detected using Amersham ECL Prime Western
Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare) on an ImageQuant LAS4000 CCD
imaging system (GE Healthcare). The blot was subsequently stripped by sub-
mersion in stripping buffer (10 mM 2-Mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mM
Tris·HCl, pH 6.8) for 30 min at 70 °C and reprobed with polyclonal beta tubulin
antibody ab6046 (Abcam) to enable normalization of the UTB signal.
Statistical Analysis. For all statistical analyses, replicate data points were first
averaged and data normalized to appropriate reference values already de-
scribed. Statistical analysis was performed using JMP Statistical Discovery software
(JMP 11.2.0; SAS Institute Inc.). The normality of each set of measurements was
tested using the Shapiro–Wilk W test. Measurements that failed this test (P <
0.05) were log10 transformed to approximate a normal distribution. Compari-
sons of means between groups were then performed using ANOVA standard
least squares models. Mean ± SEM is presented for these data. Where a set of
measurements did not approximate a normal distribution even after log10
transformation (Shapiro–Wilk W < 0.05), comparison between groups was per-
formed on nontransformed data using the nonparametric Wilcoxon two-sample
t test. Confidence intervals (95%) of each group are presented for non-
parametric data. Differences between groups were considered statistically sig-
nificant at P < 0.05. Corrections for multiple testing are reported where applied.
The mean comparisons performed were between disease and control groups
and between males and females. For measures where a statistically significant
effect of sex was observed, this is reported in text. For these measures, the
disease effect was subsequently recalculated, with sex included as a variable
within the statistical model, and results reported.
To analyze the pairwise correlation between variables, Pearson’s cor-
relation coefficient (r) for parametric data and Spearman’s correlation co-
efficient for nonparametric data were determined. Differences in correlation

 coefficients between disease and control groups were analyzed using Fish-
er’s r-to-z transformation. Correlations, and differences in correlations be-
tween disease and control groups, were considered statistically significant at
P < 0.05. Corrections for multiple testing are reported where applied.
