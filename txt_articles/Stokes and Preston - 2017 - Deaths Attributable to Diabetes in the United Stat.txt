Abstract
Objective
The goal of this research was to identify the fraction of deaths attributable to diabetes in the
United States.
Research Design and Methods
We estimated population attributable fractions (PAF) for cohorts aged 30–84 who were sur-
veyed in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) between 1997 and 2009 (N = 282,322)
and in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 1999 and
2010 (N = 21,814). Cohort members were followed prospectively for mortality through 2011.
We identified diabetes status using self-reported diagnoses in both NHIS and NHANES and
using HbA1c in NHANES. Hazard ratios associated with diabetes were estimated using Cox
model adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, and smoking status.
Results
We found a high degree of consistency between data sets and definitions of diabetes in the
hazard ratios, estimates of diabetes prevalence, and estimates of the proportion of deaths
attributable to diabetes. The proportion of deaths attributable to diabetes was estimated to
be 11.5% using self-reports in NHIS, 11.7% using self-reports in NHANES, and 11.8%
using HbA1c in NHANES. Among the sub-groups that we examined, the PAF was highest
among obese persons at 19.4%. The proportion of deaths in which diabetes was assigned
as the underlying cause of death (3.3–3.7%) severely understated the contribution of diabe-
tes to mortality in the United States.
Conclusion
Diabetes may represent a more prominent factor in American mortality than is commonly
appreciated, reinforcing the need for robust population-level interventions aimed at diabetes
prevention and care.

 Introduction
The prevalence of diabetes has been rising rapidly throughout the world. Global age-standard-
ized diabetes prevalence increased from an estimated 4.3% in 1980 to 9.0% in 2014 in men,
and from 5.0% to 7.9% in women.[1] The United States is no exception to this trend. Using
combined criteria of self-reported diagnosis, fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c, the
prevalence of diabetes among adults aged 20+ rose from 8.4% in 1988–94 to 12.1% in 2005–10.
[2, 3] Trends are similar when HbA1c is the sole criterion.[4, 5] The prevalence of self-reported
diagnoses rose very rapidly between 1990 and 2008 and slowly during the 1980’s and between
2008 and 2012.[6]
Diabetes is associated with many diseases and disabilities, including ischemic heart disease,
renal disease, visual impairment, peripheral arterial disease, peripheral neuropathy, and cogni-
tive impairment.[7, 8] It is also associated with mortality.[9] In 2010, diabetes was the seventh
leading cause of death in the United States. It was listed as the underlying cause of death on
69,091 death certificates (2.8% of total deaths) and appeared in some location on a total of
234,051 death certificates.[10]
The frequency with which diabetes is listed as the underlying cause of death is not a reliable
indicator of its actual contribution to the national mortality profile. The sensitivity and speci-
ficity of death certificate assignments of diabetes as an underlying cause of death are low, far
below those of administrative records or surveys.[11, 12] People who die with diabetes typi-
cally have other conditions that may contribute to death. When both diabetes and cardiovascu-
lar disease are mentioned on a death certificate, whether or not diabetes is listed as the
underlying cause is highly variable and to some extent arbitrary. For example, it is affected by
the decedent’s race and sex, whether the death occurs in a hospital, and the number of cardiol-
ogists per capita in the area.[13]
An alternative means of estimating the contribution of diabetes to the national mortality
profile is to use nationally representative cohorts to identify the excess mortality risk among
people with diabetes. That excess risk can be used in combination with the prevalence of diabe-
tes among deaths to estimate the fraction of deaths that would not have occurred in the
absence of diabetes. This figure is typically referred to as the population attributable fraction
(PAF).[14] Saydah et al.[15] used this approach for individuals aged 30–75 who were surveyed
in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey II (NHANES II) between 1976 and
1980. They concluded that diagnosed diabetes was responsible for 3.6% of deaths. If undiag-
nosed diabetes were included, the PAF rose to 5.1%.
These estimates were based on the prevalence of diabetes during 1976–80 and do not
account for the subsequent upsurge in prevalence. Furthermore, the relative risks of death
associated with diabetes may have declined over time.[16, 17] In this paper, we use NHANES
and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to estimate the fraction of deaths attribut-
able to diabetes for cohorts aged 30–84 during the period 1997–2011. We compare estimates
of the fraction of deaths attributable to diabetes to comparable measures based on national
vital statistics.
Methods
We estimated the mortality consequences of diabetes in two nationally representative samples
of US adults surveyed in the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) and in the
National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). In both data sets, individuals were linked to deaths
in the National Death Index through December 31, 2011, the last date to which the National
Center for Health Statistics has performed this linkage. Although NHIS only provides self-
reports of the presence of diabetes, it has the advantage of a much larger sample size, allowing

 us to examine how diabetes’ contribution to mortality varies with certain characteristics.
NHANES contains data both on self-reported diabetes and on HbA1c levels, a preferred bio-
marker for the presence of diabetes. Drawing on both data sources provides a more compre-
hensive picture of the contribution of diabetes to deaths in the United States than using either
source alone.
The NHIS is an annual cross-sectional survey of the non-institutionalized U.S. population.
We pooled those surveyed from 1997 to 2009. NHIS data were obtained through the Integrated
Health Interview Series, which is a publicly available set of harmonized NHIS variables.[18]
NHIS assessed diabetes status by asking participants whether a doctor or other health profes-
sional had ever told them that they had diabetes. While less precise than clinical measures, self-
reports of diabetes have high sensitivity and specificity. In a review of 12 studies of self-reports,
the median sensitivity (proportion of cases correctly identified) was 81% and median specific-
ity (proportion of non-cases correctly identified) was 99%.[11] Response categories for the
self-reported diabetes question included yes/no as well as “borderline”. We considered individ-
uals in the latter group as non-diabetic for purposes of this study.
We adopted several inclusion criteria in the analysis of NHIS data. We restricted the sample
to individuals between the ages 30–84 at the time of survey with non-missing data on diabetes,
mortality status and model covariates. Our analysis begins with individuals at age 30 because
the incidence of diabetes and of mortality is very low at younger ages. The age range terminates
at age 85 because the multiple pathologies typically present above age 85 makes the role of dia-
betes increasingly ambiguous. Second, we limited mortality follow-up to five years beyond the
survey date in order to reduce the length of time between diagnosis and exposure to death.
The sample size for analyses of the NHIS was 282,322 individuals.
NHANES is a continuous series of nationally representative surveys of the non-institution-
alized population of the United States. We used data from NHANES cohorts surveyed from
1999 to 2010. We defined diabetes on the basis of the HbA1c test. Advantages of HbA1c
include that it better reflects average glycemia and exhibits greater stability and lower variation
within individuals compared to other diagnostic markers, such as fasting plasma glucose. [19]
Furthermore, because HbA1c does not require fasting, it is available for all rather than a subset
of NHANES participants. We used the American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines [19]
to classify individuals with diabetes as having an HbA1c value greater than 6.5%. We further
classified as diabetic persons whose HbA1c values were below 6.5% but who reported use of an
oral hypoglycemic agent or insulin. For the analysis of self-reported diabetes we classified indi-
viduals with “borderline” diabetes as non-diabetic to be consistent with the analysis of the
NHIS. We excluded individuals with missing information on diabetes, mortality status and
model covariates. To create a comparable age range to that used in the NHIS analysis, we cen-
sored individuals upon their achievement of age 90.0. The sample size for analyses of the
NHANES was 21,814 individuals.
We used information provided on the death certificate to identify whether diabetes was
assigned as the underlying cause of death, defined by the World Health Organization as "the
disease or injury which initiated the train of events leading directly to death, or the circum-
stances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury." [20] When diabetes was
mentioned anywhere on the death certificate, including as underlying cause, we considered
diabetes to be a “contributing cause of death”. The frequency of diabetes as an underlying or
contributing cause of death is compared to its population attributable fraction (PAF), defined
by the World Health Organization “the proportional reduction in population disease or mor-
tality that would occur if exposure to a risk factor were reduced to an alternative ideal exposure
scenario.” [21] In the present case, the alternative ideal exposure is the absence of diabetes.

 We estimated Cox models relating diabetes status to all-cause mortality with age as the
underlying time scale. The preferred model was adjusted for sex, age, race/ethnicity (non-His-
panic white, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, Other), educational attainment (less than high
school graduate, high school graduate, and more than high school) and smoking status (never,
former, current). In a sensitivity analysis, we adjusted for body mass index (BMI) using the cat-
egories <18.5, 18.5–25; 25–30; 30–35; and 35+. BMI values are in units of kg/m2 and are based
on self-reported height and weight in the NHIS and measured height and weight in the
NHANES. In stratified analyses, we used a threshold of 30 kg/m2 for defining obesity status.
We calculated the proportion of deaths attributable to diabetes (population attributable
fraction (PAF)) using the following formula:
PAF ¼
X
k
i¼0
pdi
HRi � 1
HRi
�
�
ð1Þ
where pdi refers to the proportion of decedents in diabetes category i and HRi refers to the haz-
ard ratio with respect to mortality for an individual in category i.[22] Those without diabetes
were assigned a hazard ratio of 1.00. The proportion of deaths occurring to those with diabetes,
as well as the hazard ratios, were based on estimates specific to the group for whom PAF values
were provided.
The proportional hazards assumption was tested using a time-varying coefficients model.
Because the interaction term between attained age and diabetes status was significant in this
model, indicating a violation of proportionality, we performed a sensitivity analysis in which
we re-estimated PAF values using age-specific hazards obtained from the time-varying coeffi-
cients model. This was accomplished by applying Eq 1 to data in 5-year wide age intervals
using the predicted hazard ratio at the midpoint of each interval. To estimate the PAF value
for all ages combined, we weighted the age-specific PAF values by the age distribution of
deaths for that group.
In calculating hazard ratios, prevalence values and PAFs, we adjusted for unequal probabili-
ties of selection and non-response using sample weights and accounted for the complex survey
design. All analyses were performed using STATA 13 (StataCorp, Texas, USA). We estimated
variances with the SVY routine, which uses Taylor series linearization. Uncertainty intervals
for population attributable fractions were estimated using the punafcc package.[23]
Results
Table 1 shows the characteristics of individuals surveyed in NHANES and NHIS. The total
sample size was more than 10 times larger in NHIS than in NHANES. The distribution of
characteristics was very similar in the two data sources with the exception of BMI, which was
based on self-reported weight and height in NHIS, whereas it was measured in NHANES.
Consistent with a well-documented tendency for people to underestimate their weight and
overestimate their height [24], the proportion obese was higher in NHANES (35.0%) than in
NHIS (28.5%).
Fig 1 shows the prevalence of diabetes in NHIS among the surveyed population and among
subsequent deaths to those surveyed. In all cases, the prevalence was higher among deaths
than among individuals at survey, reflecting the higher mortality of individuals with diabetes.
For all groups combined, diabetes had been diagnosed among 8.5% of the population at base-
line and among 23.7% of those who died during the 5-year follow-up period. We are not aware
of previous estimates that document the very high proportion of individuals dying in the
United States who have been diagnosed with diabetes. That value reached 30.5% among blacks

 and 37.9% among the obese. The value among the obese was approximately double that
among the non-obese (18.6%).
Fig 2 presents the hazard ratios and their confidence intervals for those diagnosed with dia-
betes relative to those who were not. For the NHIS sample as a whole, the hazard ratio was
1.93 with a confidence interval extending from 1.84 to 2.03. The hazard ratios were higher in
women (2.07, 95% CI 1.94–2.22) compared to men (1.83, 95% CI 1.72–1.95) and for people
aged 30–59 (2.53, 95% CI 2.27–2.82) and 60–74 (2.01, 95% CI 1.87–2.17) compared to those
aged 75–84 (1.62, 95% CI 1.50–1.75). A decline with age in the hazard associated with diabetes
has also appeared in other studies.[9,25]
The hazard ratios in Fig 2 combine with prevalence values shown in Fig 1 to produce esti-
mates of the proportion of deaths attributable to diabetes. These values are presented in
Table 2. For the cohort as a whole, an estimated 11.5% of deaths were attributable to diabetes.
Among the characteristics examined, by far the highest proportion of deaths attributable to
diabetes, 19.4%, occurred among obese people, compared to only 8.8% among the non-obese.
The PAF value was 10.6% for males and 12.5% for females. The female excess was primarily
a result of the higher hazard ratio associated with diabetes for females (Fig 2). The PAF for
both Blacks and Hispanics was 13.0%, compared to 11.1% for Non-Hispanic Whites. The high
PAF for Hispanics and non-Hispanic blacks is entirely a product of a high prevalence of diabe-
tes rather than of higher hazard ratios. As shown in Fig 2, the hazard ratio for Whites was 2.01,
compared to 1.74 for Blacks and 1.80 for Hispanics. Likewise, the modest rise in PAF from the
cohort surveyed in 1997–2001 to that in 2002–06 is completely a product of rising prevalence.
The proportion of deaths in which diabetes is assigned as the underlying cause of death was
much lower than the population attributable fraction (Table 2). For the nation as a whole, only
3.3% of deaths in these cohorts were assigned to diabetes as the underlying cause. However,

 when deaths were added in which diabetes was mentioned on the death certificate elsewhere
than as the underlying cause of death, the proportion rose to 10.8%, similar to the PAF value.
The patterns of variation in the two series across subgroups are also correlated, with the high-
est frequency of death certificate mentions of diabetes also occurring among the obese. It is
not the case that attending physicians and coroners are simply reporting on death certificates
the presence of diabetes among those who have been diagnosed with the disease; more than
twice as many decedents had been diagnosed with diabetes (23.7%) as had the condition
reported anywhere on their death certificate (10.8%).
Estimates derived from NHIS and NHANES are compared in Table 3. The hazard ratio
using the HbA1c criterion in NHANES was 1.88, with a wide confidence band from 1.63 to
2.16. The estimated value is clearly similar to the estimate of 1.93 derived from NHIS. Could
some of the small difference between these estimates be attributed to differences in the mea-
sures used to identify diabetes? That question can be addressed by virtue of the two criteria
used in NHANES to assess diabetes status. Using only self-reports in NHANES, the hazard
ratio was 2.00 (95% CI 1.75–2.28), slightly higher than the estimated hazard ratio of 1.88 using
HbA1c and the hazard ratio of 1.93 using self-reports in NHIS.
The multiple criteria for diabetes in NHANES enable us to distinguish between those with
diabetes who report a diagnosis of diabetes and those whose diabetes is undiagnosed. One
might imagine that those with undiagnosed diabetes were at higher risk of death precisely

 because it is undiagnosed. However, individuals with diagnosed diabetes had significantly ele-
vated risks (HR 2.05, 95% CI 1.77–2.37), whereas the risk associated with undiagnosed diabetes
was weaker and not significant (HR 1.28, 95% CI 0.95–1.74). It appears that those whose diabe-
tes is undiagnosed have, on average, a better prognosis than those whose diabetes is diagnosed
(see also [26,27]).
Table 3 also shows that the proportion of deaths attributable to diabetes among cohorts
aged 30–84 when surveyed in NHANES was 11.8% using the HbA1c criterion and 11.7%
based on self-reports. These values are very close to the value of 11.5% estimated using NHIS
and the confidence intervals overlap substantially. The proportion of deaths in which diabetes
is listed as the underlying cause, or mentioned anywhere on the death certificate, was also very
similar in NHANES and NHIS (Table 3).

 Discussion
The study most comparable to ours used cohorts aged 30–74 who were surveyed in NHANES
II between 1976 and 1980 and followed them into mortality statistics through 1992. (15) Using
self-reported diabetes, this study reported a hazard ratio of 1.9, a prevalence at survey of 4.3%,
and a PAF of 3.6%. Adding undiagnosed cases that were detected using fasting plasma glucose,
the PAF increased to 5.1%. The main reason why the PAF values in the present study are

 much higher is that the prevalence of diabetes has risen sharply since 1976–80 (see also
[28,29]).
Our estimates of the hazard ratios associated with diabetes are similar to those found in
other studies. Gregg et al.[30] also used NHIS data to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for adults
aged 18+ with self-reported diabetes. They found hazard ratios in the range of 1.68–2.13 for
males and females in data for cohort surveyed in 1997–98, 1999–2000, and 2001–03, followed
by a fall off to 1.52–1.58 in 2003–04. We also find a decline between cohorts surveyed in
1997–2001 and 2002–06 but it is less abrupt, perhaps because our cohorts pertain to time
periods that are twice as wide. The Gregg et al. mortality analysis extended only to 2006 while
our mortality analysis extends to 2011. The DECODE study pooled 20 European studies
including 30,000 people with ages ranging from 30 to 89.[31] Using fasting plasma glucose
criteria, the relative risk of death for those with diabetes was approximately 1.9–2.0.[27, 31]
Using a variety of clinical diagnostic criteria, a British cohort study of 44,000 individuals
aged 35–89 reported a hazard ratio of 1.93.[25] Our estimated hazard ratios are consistent
with these studies.
We explored the sensitivity of our results to three alternative specifications. First, we imple-
mented a time-varying coefficients model using data from the NHIS to investigate whether
introducing an interaction term between attained age and diabetes status in the hazard model
would influence estimates of the overall PAF. The resulting PAF value for females was 12.9%
compared to 12.5% without age interactions. For males, the corresponding values were 11.0%
and 10.6%. Thus, the introduction of age interactions has small effects on the estimated PAF
values, effects that are well within the confidence intervals shown in Table 2.
Second, we introduced a five-category control for body mass index (BMI) in our regression
used to estimate the hazard ratio for diabetes. We anticipated that introducing obesity may
lower the PAF because diabetes status, positively correlated with obesity, may be associated
with the higher mortality suffered by obese people from cardiovascular disease. Such an associ-
ation would spuriously inflate the hazard ratio for diabetes. Instead, the hazard ratio estimated
on NHIS data rose from 1.93 to 2.00 when obesity was controlled and the PAF value rose from
11.5% to 11.9%
Third, we investigated how the PAF value would change if pre-diabetes were included in
the analysis. For this purpose, we used values of HbA1c in NHANES to define the categories of
normal (less than 5.7%), pre-diabetic (5.7–6.4%) and diabetic (6.5% and above). People with
an HbA1c value below 6.5% with reported use of oral glycemic medication or insulin contin-
ued to be included in the diabetic category. The PAF value using this three-category variable is
14.0% (95% CI 9.3–18.5), compared to the earlier estimate of 11.8% (95% CI 9.0–14.6) when
considering diabetes as a dichotomy. In this paper, we treat diabetes as a dichotomy, a status
that is either achieved or is not. This approach enables us to use the rich resources of both
NHIS and NHANES in the investigation. But it should be borne in mind that, if we were
instead to treat diabetes as a disease process identified by above-normal HbA1c levels, then the
proportion of deaths attributable to it would be higher by approximately 2.2%.
The major strength of this analysis is its use of two national data sources and two different
measures of diabetes to investigate its role in American mortality. That these data sources and
measures produce similar estimates of the proportion of adult deaths attributable to diabetes
gives greater confidence in each of the separate estimates.
A weakness of the present approach is that diabetes status is measured at baseline and could
change during the follow up period. While transitions from diabetes to non-diabetes status are
rare, transitions from non-diabetes to diabetes are not rare. To mitigate this potential source
of measurement error we restricted mortality follow-up to 5 years. The annual incidence rate
of diabetes among non-diabetic adults is approximately 0.008.[6] That means that, over the

 5-year follow-up period, an average of 2% [.008 x 2.5] of those without the disease at the outset
would have developed it. These new cases represent a misclassification error that is likely to
induce a slight downward bias in our estimates of the mortality effects of diabetes and the frac-
tion of deaths attributable to it.[32]
Conclusion
To investigate the proportion of deaths attributable to diabetes, we used two independent data
sets and two different criteria for identifying diabetes among individuals aged 30–84. We
found a high degree of consistency in the resulting hazard ratios, estimates of diabetes preva-
lence, and estimates of the proportion of deaths attributable to diabetes. The proportion of
deaths attributable to diabetes was estimated to be 11.5% using self-reports in NHIS, 11.7%
using self-reports in NHANES, and 11.8% using HbA1c in NHANES. The proportion of
deaths attributable to diabetes is much greater than the 3.3–3.7% of deaths in which diabetes is
assigned as the underlying cause of death.
Responsibility for approximately 12% of deaths would make diabetes the third leading
cause of death in the United States in 2010, after diseases of the heart and malignant neoplasms
and ahead of chronic lower respiratory diseases and cerebrovascular diseases.[33] The inclu-
sion of pre-diabetes in the risk category would raise the proportion of deaths attributable to
diabetes by an additional 2%. These results demonstrate that diabetes is a major feature on the
landscape of American mortality and reinforce the need for robust population-level interven-
tions aimed at diabetes prevention and care.
