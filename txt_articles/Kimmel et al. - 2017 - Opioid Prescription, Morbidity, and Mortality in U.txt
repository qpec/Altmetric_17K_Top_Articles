ABSTRACT
Aggressive pain treatment was advocated for ESRD patients, but new Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention guidelines recommend cautious opioid prescription. Little is known regarding outcomes as-
sociated with ESRD opioid prescription. We assessed opioid prescriptions and associations between
opioid prescription and dose and patient outcomes using 2006–2010 US Renal Data System information
in patients on maintenance dialysis with Medicare Part A, B, and D coverage in each study year (n=671,281,
of whom 271,285 were unique patients). Opioid prescription was confirmed from Part D prescription
claims. In the 2010 prevalent cohort (n=153,758), we examined associations of opioid prescription with
subsequent all-cause death, dialysis discontinuation, and hospitalization controlled for demographics,
comorbidity, modality, and residence. Overall, .60% of dialysis patients had at least one opioid prescrip-
tion every year. Approximately 20% of patients had a chronic ($90-day supply) opioid prescription each
year, in 2010 usually for hydrocodone, oxycodone, or tramadol. In the 2010 cohort, compared with pa-
tients without an opioid prescription, patients with short-term (1–89 days) and chronic opioid prescriptions
had increased mortality, dialysis discontinuation, and hospitalization. All opioid drugs associated with
mortality; most associated with worsened morbidity. Higher opioid doses correlated with death in a mono-
tonically increasing fashion. We conclude that opioid drug prescription is associated with increased risk of
death, dialysis discontinuation, and hospitalization in dialysis patients. Causal relationships cannot be
inferred, and opioid prescription may be an illness marker. Efforts to treat pain effectively in patients on
dialysis yet decrease opioid prescriptions and dose deserve consideration.

Pain has been appreciated as important for patients
with ESRD since the seminal work of Binik et al.1
.30 years ago. Pain is common among patients on
dialysis,2–5 occurring in over 50% of patients, but
its prevalence and severity vary in different areas
and populations.3,6 Pain is linked to greater depres-
sive affect and diminished quality of life in patients
with and without kidney disease.3,4,6–12 Under-
treatment of pain in patients on hemodialysis
(HD) has also been reported,13,14 although treat-
ment was defined as medication use in both studies.
Over the last 15 years, aggressive pain treatment has
been advocated for patients with ESRD.4,13,15,16
In the 1990s, the Joint Commission and the
medical community focused on eradication of
pain and its recognition as “the fifth vital sign.”17
Prescriptions of opioids for pain relief increased
significantly18; however, as recently as 2000, no ad-
verse health effects were noted.19 Subsequently, it

 was recognized that opioids were being overprescribed and
associated with adverse outcomes.18,20,21 Over the last 5 years,
high rates of opioid medication prescriptions and adverse
effects associated with their use have become increasingly ev-
ident in the general population.18,22 The estimated total direct
and indirect costs of opioid overdose in the United States were
at least $18 billion in 2009.23 Recent guidelines developed by
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
recommend caution in opioid medication prescription.18 Al-
though national trends in use and outcomes of opioids have
been widely reported, data for patients on dialysis remain
limited.24,25
We assessed the prevalence of opioid medication prescrip-
tion in United States patients on maintenance dialysis and
factors associated with prescription, and we determined asso-
ciations between such chronic opioid prescription and dose

 and mortality, discontinuation of dialysis, and hospitalizations
using data from the US Renal Data System (USRDS) and the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), including
Medicare Part D files for prescription information.
RESULTS
Table 1 shows the population of adult patients on dialysis with
at least 365 days of dialysis treatment who were continuously
enrolled (at least 365 days of enrollment) in Medicare Part A,
B, and D in a specific year. There were 271,285 unique patients
who were studied during 2006–2010, including approximately
100,000–154,000 such patients on dialysis each year.
The study population (n=153,758 in 2010) was different
from the parent ESRD population (n=513,647) (Figure 1) in that
it had proportionally more women, was younger, had more black
patients, and had more patients with a greater number of hospi-
talizations in 2010 (Supplemental Table 1). The study population
was predominantly men and disproportionatelyblack, consistent
with the Medicare ESRD dialysis population.
More than 94% were treated with HD; ,8% had had renal
transplantation. About three quarters were dually eligible for
Medicare and Medicaid, reflecting the fact that all dual cover-
age beneficiaries receive Part D coverage, an option for other
patients. Over one half had ESRD vintage .4 years, had one or
more prior hospital admissions, and lived in large metropol-
itan areas. About 11% were nursing home residents (Table 1).
During 2006–2010, .60% of patients with ESRD on di-
alysis received a prescription for an opioid medication (63.1%
in 2006 and 64.0% in 2010; data not shown). The total med-
ication cost increased from $29 million in 2006 to $49 million
in 2010 (data not shown). During the study period, over 20%
of patients on dialysis (20.0% in 2006 and 23.4% in 2010) had
$90 days of filled chronic opioid prescrip-
tions (Table 2). Over 50% of patients on
dialysis had opioid prescriptions only
(53.0% in 2006 and 51.4% in 2010), 32%
(34.0% in 2006 and 32.8% in 2010) had
neither analgesic nor opioid prescriptions,
over 10% had both opioid and analgesic
prescriptions (10.6% in 2008 and 11.0%
in 2010), and about 3% had an analgesic
prescription only (3.5% in 2006 and 3.2%
in 2010).
Approximately 15% of patients on peri-
toneal dialysis (PD; 14.2% in 2006 and
16.7% in 2010) had $90 days of filled
chronic opioid prescriptions. Patients
who previously received kidney transplan-
tation and were currently treated with di-
alysis had chronic opioid prescription rates
of 23.1% (2006) to 25.7% (2010), consis-
tently higher than those in patients who
had never had a transplant.
Chronic opioid prescription rates ranged from 9.5% of pa-
tientsondialysisinHawaiito40.6%ofpatientsinWestVirginia
in 2010. Seven other states had prescription rates .30%
(Michigan, Oklahoma, Oregon, Kentucky, Idaho, Indiana,
and Alabama) (Figure 2). Highest dialysis patient opioid pre-
scription rates were among women, patients 45–64 years old,
and nursing home residents. Dual status dialysis patients had a
higher rate of chronic opioid prescription. Prior pain-related
hospitalizations were associated with higher chronic opioid
prescription as was a greater number of hospitalizations (all
P,0.01).
The opioids most commonly prescribed for $90 days dur-
ing 2006–2010 were hydrocodone (increasing from 8.6% in
2006 to 11.7% in 2010) and oxycodone (increasing from 4.1%
in 2006 to 5.4% in 2010). The third most commonly pre-
scribed opioid for $90 days was propoxyphene in 2006–
2007 (approximately 2.2%) and tramadol in 2008–2010
(2.1%–2.5%) (Table 3).
Table 4 shows factors associated with chronic prescription
of any opioid in 2010 dialysis patients, adjusting for all listed
characteristics. Chronic opioid prescription was indepen-
dently associated with women (odds ratio [OR], 1.21; 95%
confidence interval [95% CI], 1.18 to 1.24), white race (com-
pared with black race; OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.15), nursing
home residence (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.18), dual status
(OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.55 to 1.65), cancer diagnosis (OR, 1.13;
95% CI, 1.07 to 1.19), and prior pain-related hospitalizations
in 2010 (OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 2.18 to 2.38).
Patients on PD were less likely to have received a chronic
opioid prescription than patients on HD (OR, 0.68; 95% CI,
0.64 to 0.72; P,0.001). There was no difference between the
proportions of patients with or without a history of kidney
transplantation who received chronic opioid prescriptions.
Younger patients had higher opioid prescription rates.

 Compared with patients age 65 years old or older, the ORs
(95% CIs) in those 20–44 and 45–64 years old were OR, 1.28
(95% CI, 1.23 to 1.33) and OR, 1.59 (95% CI, 1.54 to 1.63),
respectively. Compared with patients with 1–2 years ESRD
vintage, the odds of a chronic opioid pre-
scription were 12% (95% CI, 1.08 to 1.16)
greater for patients with 5 or more years
ESRD vintage.
Patients who received a prescription for
nonopioid analgesics were more likely to
have received an opioid prescription as
well (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.54 to 1.64;
P,0.001). Patients living in rural (OR,
1.52; 95% CI, 1.47 to 1.57) and medium/
small metropolitan areas (1.36; 95% CI,
1.32 to 1.40) had greater likelihood of
chronic opioid prescription than those liv-
ing in large metropolitan areas. There was
a greater likelihood of opioid prescription
associated with greater numbers of hospi-
talizations in 2010 (OR increasing from
1.48 [95% CI, 1.44 to 1.52] for one to two
admissions to 2.42 [95% CI, 2.32 to 2.53]
for more than four admissions).
Differences existed among patients who
received short-term and chronic opioid
prescriptions compared with those who did
not in the 2010 dialysis cohort (Table 5).
A majority of patients on dialysis who re-
ceived either short-term or chronic opioid
prescriptions had morphine milligram
equivalent (MME) doses .20/d. There was
no difference between the proportions of
patients with a history of kidney transplan-
tation who received short-term or chronic
opioid prescriptions in 2010. Of patients
who received an analgesic prescription,
15.7% received short-term opioid prescrip-
tions, and 19.7% received chronic opioid
prescriptions (Table 5).
Table 6 shows associations of short-
term and chronic opioid prescription in
2010 with subsequent all-cause death, dis-
continuation of dialysis, and hospitaliza-
tion in the 2010 prevalent dialysis cohort.
Mortality was increased in patients with
short-term prescriptions and in all cate-
gories of long-term prescriptions. After ad-
justment for covariates, patients on dialysis
with short-term opioid prescriptions had
slightly increased risks of death (hazard ra-
tio [HR], 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.07), dis-
continuation of dialysis (HR, 1.13; 95% CI,
1.05 to 1.22), and hospitalization (HR,
1.13; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.14) compared
with patients on dialysis who had not received an opioid pre-
scription. The risks of death, discontinuation of dialysis, and
hospitalization for patients who received chronic opioid pre-
scription increased monotonically as the MME dose increased

 from ,20 to .50. Black patients were less likely than white
patients to experience such events, but patients on PD were
more likely than patients on HD to experience such events. As
the age and vintage of patients on dialysis who received chronic
opioid prescriptions increased, they were more likely to experi-
ence such events.
Patients who had renal transplantationwere less likely to die
or discontinue dialysis than those who had not had renal trans-
plantation. Patients who received a nonopioid analgesic pre-
scription were less likely to die during the observation period
but more likely to be hospitalized than those who had not had
such a prescription.
Table 7 shows associations of subsequent all-cause death,
discontinuation of dialysis, and hospitalization with the com-
mon individual chronic prescribed opioid/narcotic agents in
the 2010 prevalent dialysis cohort. All individual opioids pre-
scribed were associated with significantly increased risk of
death. Codeine prescription was not significantly associated
with dialysis discontinuation risk (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.88 to
1.90), but the number of codeine prescriptions was relatively
small. Prescription of any of the individual drugs was associ-
ated with significantly increased hospitalization risk. Chronic
prescriptions of hydrocodone, oxycodone, propoxyphene,
morphine, hydromorphone, and fentanyl were significantly
associated with increased risk of discontinuation of dialysis.
We conducted two sensitivity analyses to assess whether our
results were consistent with new use research. First, we sub-
divided our sample of 2010 patients with ESRD to eliminate all
patients who had any opioid prescription in the 6 months
before January 1, 2010 (Supplemental Tables 2 and 3). The
results were similar to those of the main analysis. Short-term
opioid prescription was not associated with mortality, but it
was associated with hospitalization. Chronic high dose pre-
scription was associated with increased mortality, and there
was a stepwise increase in mortality associated with increasing
dose levels.
Second, we assessed first use patients in
2010 (Supplemental Tables 4 and 5). Anal-
yses of first use did not show significant
associations with mortality, dialysis dis-
continuation, or hospitalization (Supple-
mental Tables 4 and 5). Neither sensitivity
analysis contradicted findings regarding
long-term chronic opioid use.
DISCUSSION
Almost two thirds of patients on dialysis
received at least one opioid prescription ev-
ery year, and over 20% received chronic
prescriptions ($90 days of filled prescrip-
tions), three times as great as the rate of
chronic opioid prescription in the general
Medicare population.22 Over one quarter
of opioid users received doses exceeding CDC or other recom-
mendations. Although the cost of these prescriptions in 2010 was
not great ($49 million), the potential clinical effect of this use
is important, because both chronic use and high-dose

 prescriptions are associated with increased risk of death and
adverse events.
Opioid prescription in patients on dialysis has increased
over time, and the demographic and geographic trends seem
to be similar to those in the general population.22 Eight states
had chronic opioid prescription rates of 30% or more. The
reasons for this are unknown but probably reflect differential
physician practice. Such regional variation provides opportu-
nities for intervention.
United States general population death rates attributable to
opioid overdose increased fivefold from 0.08 to 0.38 per
100,000 from 1993 to 2009.26 Total prescription opioid over-
dose events nearly tripled from 8815 hospitalizations in 1999
to 22,907 hospitalizations in 2006. Opioid prescriptions at
hospital discharge were associated with subsequent chronic
opioid use.27
Chronic ($90-day) prescription of opioids increased in the
general Medicare population from 4.6% in 2007 to 7.4% in
2012 in an analysis limited to Schedule II and III drugs, ex-
cluding patients with cancer diagnoses or residing in nursing
homes.22 Similar to the general population and other analyses,
in this study, chronic opioid prescription was most common
among white patients on dialysis, those not living in large
metropolitan areas, and those living in poverty. We found
that the most commonly prescribed opioids for patients on
dialysis were similar to those previously reported earlier in
patients on dialysis.25 Such prescription is also similar to
that in the general population, where hydrocodone accounted
for 51% and oxycodone accounted for 16% of prescriptions.28
Prescription of these drugs to patients on dialysis does not take
into account specific recommendations for use or avoidance in
this population.29 However, our results may reflect a different
study population relative to the study by Kuo et al.22 because of
the over-representation of dual eligibility patients on dialysis.
The associationsthatwe show between opioid prescriptions
and dialysis patient mortality are striking. All commonly pre-
scribed medications were associated with an increased risk of
death. In addition, most of the commonly prescribed opioid
medications were associated with increased adverse events,
specifically discontinuation of dialysis and all-cause hospital-
ization in the dialysis population. Similar to the general Medi-
care population, rural residents were more likely to receive
opioid prescriptions. As expected, opioid prescription was
more common in patients with cancer, those residing in nurs-
ing homes, those with prior hospitalization, or those who had a
pain-related hospitalization.
It is important that hospitalization, perhaps because of the
relationship of ESRD patients with new physicians, does not
become a reason for opioid prescription in this population.30
In addition, opioid prescription was more common in ESRD
patients of greater vintage, suggesting that this may be a re-
sponse to the ongoing burden of long-standing dialysis. In the
general Medicare population, overall chronic opioid prescrip-
tions were associated with increased risk of both emergency
room visits and hospitalizations.22 Use of long-acting opioids,
compared with anticonvulsants or tricyclic antidepressants,
was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality in
Tennessee Medicaid patients with chronic noncancer pain,
consistent with our findings.31

Opioids and Mortality in Patients on Dialysis
3665
www.jasn.org
CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
 The CDC recently released clinical guidelines for opioid
prescription,18 including checklists for provider use. The
guidelines call for increased patient/physician discussions be-
fore prescription, during treatment, during decision on pain
management therapeutic plans before prescription, and dur-
ing follow-up visits. The lowest dose and duration of opioid
treatment are recommended, and nonopioid approaches are
considered essential. This is critical, because many previous
assessments of pain control, including in the dialysis popula-
tion, primarily considered analgesic and opioid drug prescrip-
tions as appropriate treatment for pain and gave less emphasis
to nonpharmacologic therapies, such as cognitive behav-
ioral therapy (CBT), psychotherapy, and biofeedback
techniques.11,12,32
Certainaspectsofpaininpatients ondialysisare uniqueand
complicate management. Muscle cramps in particular are fre-
quently present in patients on dialysis.29 Opioid use is not
recommended for this symptom. Pain syndromes occurring
during dialysis treatment include pain at the dialysis access site
as well as headaches. Step therapy is problematic in patients on
dialysis, because the National Kidney Foundation recom-
mends acetaminophen as the preferred non-narcotic analgesic
for mild to moderate pain, with nonsteroidal anti-inflamma-
tory drugs not preferred but considered for short-term use.33
Another key finding is that adverse events in this study were
strongly associated with increased opioid dose prescribed. Al-
though dosing of opioid medications in patients on dialysis is
complex, because mortality in this study was related to dose,
our data suggest that the lowest dose be prescribed.
Treatment of opioid addiction in patients on dialysis pre-
sents unique challenges. Buprenorphine may be a promising
therapy for patients on dialysis with opioid addiction.34 Nal-
oxone, which has been advocated for more generalized release
for use in populations at risk for overdose, was recently used
in a randomized trial assessing prevention of opioid relapse.35
In contrast to the general population, where CBT has been
assessed and found effective for pain management in clinical
trials,36,37 no reports of its efficacy have been published among
patients on dialysis or patients with CKD and pain.38 In addi-
tion, patients on dialysis with pain should be assessed for the
presence of coexisting diagnoses, such as depression, anxiety,
and sleep disorders, because pain is often linked to these con-
ditions.6,8,10,39 Perception of pain can be intensified by de-
pression and anxiety, both of which occur frequently in
patients with ESRD.10,12,38,39 These may be responsive to
both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies,
such as antidepressants or CBT, which may not be considered
typical interventions for pain. Treatment addressing these con-
ditions may ameliorate perceived pain. These approaches as
well as other interventions directed at improving outcomes
in patients on dialysis in pain, receiving opioid prescriptions,
or addicted to opioids deserve consideration.
Retrospective analyses do not allow distinction be-
tween whether these medications are used in patients at high

 mortality risk or with terminal conditions and whether these
medications may actually contribute to increased risk of death.
Pain itself rather than or in addition to the prescription of
medication may be in the causal pathway of mortality.6 Pre-
vious work showed that pain perceived in the nondialysis setting
rather than during treatment itself was significantly associated
with increased mortality in a single-center study of patients on
HD.6
Our study was limited to those patients with full Part A, B,
and D coverage. To the extent that prescription rates and out-
comes are different in the remaining dialysis population, our
results may notbe fully applicable to the universe ofpatientson
dialysis. Only filled prescriptions and not actual use or con-
sumption of opioids were assessed in this study. The observa-
tional and retrospective nature of this analysis establishes
associations only, not causation. Findings of increased mor-
tality among patients prescribed opioids could be related to
theiruseinpatientswithpreexistinghigherrisk,althoughthese
associations persisted despite adjustment for comorbid con-
ditions and other factors known to be associated with mortal-
ity. Retrospective studies are subject to biases, which may be
limitedbynewuseranalyses.Wedonotknowthecauseofdeath
of the patients in this study.
Furthermore, opioid prescription is not equivalent to ad-
diction, and for many patients in the study, such prescription
may be appropriate. Subclassification, therefore, probably ex-
ists for the patients in the study but cannot be delineated from
the available data, and it remains an area for further research.
Physicians, including nephrologists, should exercise caution in
such prescription, engaging in discussions with patients as
prescription of opioids is initiated and maintained.
In summary, we report high rates of both chronic opioid
prescription and excessive dosing in the maintenance dialysis
population. The most commonly used agents are associated
with increased risk of mortality, hospitalization, and discontinu-
ation of dialysis, although a causal role cannot be established. A
dose-response relationship exists between the magnitude of
prescribed medications in MME and adverse outcomes. The
most commonly used opioids in this population are not con-
sistent with analgesic agents recommended for this use in
patients on dialysis on the basis of dosing and avoidance of
toxicity.29 In fact, the most commonly used agent, hydroco-
done, should have limited use in this population.29 Opioid
prescriptions, especially in this population, where pain can
have very specific, dialysis-related causes, should not be con-
sidered synonymous with treatment of pain.

Opioids and Mortality in Patients on Dialysis

CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
 To the extent that opioid drugs may cause death in patients
on dialysis, appropriate clinical interventions to reduce drug
prescription, dose level, and addiction, while keeping in mind
patient satisfaction and comfort, are warranted. Nonpharma-
cologic therapies for pain control and approaches that mini-
mize drug doses and duration of therapy deserve further study
in this population, because they may result in lower patient
mortality and morbidity.
CONCISE METHODS
Study Design, Data Sources, and Sample Selection
Using standard USRDS analysis files, we performed a retrospective
cohort study to (1) describe trends in the proportions of patients on
dialysis who received chronic prescription of opioid medications
overall and for specific opioids from 2006 to 2010; (2) examine factors
associated with chronic opioid prescription in 2010 prevalent patients on
dialysis; and (3) examine associations of all-cause death, discontinua-
tion of dialysis, and hospitalizationwith short-term orchronic prescrip-
tion of opioid overall and associated with dose prescribed and specific
opioids in 2010 prevalent patients on dialysis. We used the definition of
chronic use of opioids as defined in the opioid literature—90 days or
more of opioid prescription within a 365-day timeframe.22 We also
conducted two sensitivity analyses using a new user design.40,41
We first identified an annual cohort of adult patients $20 years old
who resided in one of 50 states or Washington, DC and were not
under hospice care (identified through claims listing place of service
as hospice). To calculate opioid use comparable with the established
literature, the cohorts were limited to full-year patients on dialysis,
continuously treated with dialysis, with Medicare as their primary
payer and full Part A, B, and D coverage (i.e., at least 365 days of
enrollment) in each study year. The selection of patients on dialysis in
year 2010 is illustrated in Figure 1. The same criteria were used to
identify patients in other study years.
Study Measures
For each patient, Part D prescription claims datawere used to determine
whether a patient had ever received a prescription for an opioid (Supple-
mental Table 6) or an analgesic medication (Supplemental Table 7) and
the days’ supply for each prescription obtained from an outpatient phar-
macy during a given calendar year. The total days’ supply per year is the
sum of the days’supply for all of the patient’s opioid prescriptions during
the year, regardless of whether the dates of the prescriptions overlapped or
continued. We identified patients as having a chronic opioid prescription
if the total supply for a study year was 90 days or more, having a short-
term opioid prescription if the total supply for the year was 1–89 days,
and a nonuser if the total days’ supply for the year was zero, consistent
with previous definitions of chronicity.22 We also calculated the MME
dosage for each opioid prescription using established conversion ta-
bles.42,43 We included overlapping opioid prescriptions per day and
calculated a daily MME by distributing the total MME for all opioid
prescriptions over the days supplied.
We did not have information regarding the indication for which
an opioid was prescribed. We also summed the total gross drug cost of
opioid prescriptions, including the ingredient cost, the dispensing fee,
and the sales tax, if any, in each study year.44
In this analysis, Medicare inpatient billing data were used to iden-
tify (1) patients’ diagnosis of cancer, (2) whether they had at least one
pain-related hospitalization, and (3) the number of hospitalizations
in each calendar year. Indicator variables were set for patients with at
least one hospitalization for cancer and at least one hospitalization
with a pain diagnosis. (Supplemental Table 8 provides the International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes
used to identify cancer and pain-related diagnoses in Medicare claims.)
Patients’ total numbers of hospitalizations in each study year were coun-
ted.Weplacedallpatientshavingnohospitalizationintoonecategoryand
assigned the other patients to one of three other categories (one or two,
three or four, or five or more hospital admissions).
Medicare physician/supplier billing data were used to indicate
whether a patient resided in a nursing home. Nursing home residents
were identified with at least one physician claim with the place of
service listed as nursing home.
We assigned patients dual status, an individual level indicator of
poverty, if they received dual insurance coverage by Medicare and
Medicaid in Medicare Part A, B, or D for at least 1 month in each
study year.45 We also flagged patients’ kidney transplantation status
before January 1, 2010 (ever or never) and dialysis modality on Jan-
uary 1, 2011 (HD or PD) for the 2010 prevalent dialysis cohort.
Patient characteristics were taken from the CMS Medical Evidence
Form (CMS Form 2728), including self-reported sex, race (black,
white, or other), and smoking status at ESRD treatment initiation,
as well as comorbid conditions.46 Patient age was calculated as of
January 1 of each relevant year and summarized into three groups
(20–44, 45–64, or #65 years old). On the basis of year of ESRD
treatment initiation, patients’ vintage for ESRD treatment for each
year was also assigned47 and categorized into three groups (1–2, 3–4,
or 5 or more years). Using county of residence, we categorized type of
residential area into large central/fringe metropolitan, medium/small
metropolitan, and nonmetropolitan (i.e., rural) using the National
Center for Health Statistics Urban–Rural Classification Scheme for
counties.48
Outcomes
The outcomes of interest were all-cause death, discontinuation of
dialysis, and incident hospitalization on or after January 1, 2011 for
the 2010 prevalent dialysis cohort.
The2010prevalentpatientsondialysiswerefollowedfromJanuary
1, 2011 for all-cause death and censored at the earliest date of kidney

loss to follow-up, or December 31, 2012. Patients were also followed
for discontinuation of dialysis, censoring for kidney transplantation,
kidney function recovery, loss to follow-up, death, or December 31,
2012. The third outcome was first hospitalization, censoring for kid-
ney transplantation, kidney function recovery, discontinuation of di-
alysis, loss to follow-up, death, or December 31, 2012.

 study year and calculated annual percentage distributions for age
group, sex, race, dialysis modality, previous history of kidney trans-
plantation, dual status, residential area, ESRD vintage, nursing home
residence, cancer status, pain-related hospitalization, and number of
hospitalizations in 2006–2010 prevalent patients on dialysis. The an-
nual proportions of patients on dialysis with chronic opioid prescrip-
tions, overall and for specific opioids as well as for specific ranges of
MME, during 2006–2010 were also determined.
Descriptive statistics were used to depict demographic character-
istics, age, ESRD vintage, dialysis modality, history of kidney trans-
plantation, hospitalization status in 2010, and status of comorbid
diseases for the 2010 prevalent dialysis cohort as a whole, by status
of overall opioid prescription (none, short term, or chronic), and by
MME. Percentage distributions were presented, and chi-squared tests
were used to compare distribution differences overall and between
opioid prescription groups.
A logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated
with chronic prescription of any opioid medication, and Cox pro-
portional hazards regression models were specified to examine the
associationof opioidprescription in 2010,overall, forspecificopioids,
and by MME, with subsequent all-cause death, discontinuation of
dialysis, and hospitalization in the 2010 prevalent dialysis cohort.
Separate proportional hazards regression models were conducted
as a sensitivity analysis to examine the association of overall opioid
prescriptionin2010 with subsequent all-cause death, discontinuation
of dialysis, and hospitalization in 2010 prevalent patients on HD and
prevalent patients on PD (Supplemental Tables 9–11).
A subpopulation of the 2010 dialysis cohort, which included pa-
tients on dialysis without any filled opioid prescription from July 1,
2009 to Dec 31, 2009, was used to examine the associations of short-
term or chronic opioid prescription with the outcomes of interest
(Supplemental Tables 2 and 3).
Anothersubpopulationofthe2010dialysiscohort,whichincluded
patients on dialysis without any filled opioid or analgesic prescription
from July 1, 2009 to December 31, 2009, was used. We identified
patients’ first prescription of an opioid or an analgesic in 2010 and
followed them from the filled date of the prescription for all-cause
death, discontinued dialysis, and first hospitalization to examine the
association of the new use of an opioid or analgesic with those out-
comes (Supplemental Tables 4 and 5).
All patient-level demographic characteristics and medical condi-
tions were included in multivariate-adjusted models. Proportional
hazards assumptions were examined by graphing log(2log[survival
function]) curves. No violation was observed. Statistical significance
was defined as P,0.05 using two-tailed tests. For three-pair multiple
comparisons, the Bonferroni method was used to define a statisti-
cally significant difference at P,0.017 using two-tailed tests. All
analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.2 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC).
