Aims
To evaluate the long-term clinical impact of the application of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) early after discharge in a
real-world population.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Methods
and results
We analysed the 5-year incidence of cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization for cardiovascular causes in two
populations, attenders vs. non-attenders to an ambulatory CR program which were consecutively discharged from
two tertiary hospitals, after ST-elevation myocardial infarction, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, coronary ar-
tery bypass graft, or planned percutaneous coronary intervention. A primary analysis using multivariable regression
model and a secondary analysis using the propensity score approach were performed. Between 1 January 2009 and
31 December 2010, 839 patients attended a CR program planned at discharged, while 441 patients were dis-
charged from Cardiovascular Department without any program of CR. During follow-up, the incidence of cardio-
vascular mortality was 6% in both groups (P = 0.62). The composite outcome of hospitalizations for cardiovascular
causes and cardiovascular mortality were lower in CR group compared to no-CR group (18% vs. 30%, P < 0.001)
and was driven by lower hospitalizations for cardiovascular causes (15 vs. 27%, P < 0.001). At multivariable Cox
proportional hazard analysis, CR program was independent predictor of lower occurrence of the composite out-
come (hazard ratio 0.58, 95% confidence interval 0.43–0.77; P < 0.001), while in the propensity-matched analysis
CR group experienced also a lower total mortality (10% vs. 19%, P = 0.002) and cardiovascular mortality (2% vs.
7%, P = 0.008) compared to no-CR group.

Conclusion
This study showed, in a real-world population, the positive effects of ambulatory CR program in improving clinical
outcomes and highlights the importance of a spread use of CR in order to reduce cardiovascular hospitalizations
and cardiovascular mortality during a long-term follow-up.

artery bypass graft (CABG), and planned percutaneous coronary
intervention (PCI), is a Class IA recommendation from the American
Heart Association/American College of Cardiology5 and the
European Society of Cardiology6,7 guidelines.
Although the efficacy of CR to reduce clinical outcomes has been
proven,8–12 this intervention remains significantly underused. Only
about a third of coronary patients in Europe receives any form of
CR and only a 25% in the USA.13–15 Based on data from the
EUROASPIRE study of cardiovascular disease management, 44.8% of
CR-eligible patients had evidence of referral and 36.5% evidence
of participation in rehabilitation.16,17 In the real-world, the absence of
CR program may result in worse clinical outcomes at long-term fol-
low-up.
Therefore, we evaluated the long-term clinical impact of the appli-
cation of an early CR program planned at discharged compared to a
population of the same geographic area who did not receive any CR
because CR service was not available.
Methods
Study population
In this study, we analysed clinical and instrumental characteristics and out-
comes of two populations, attenders vs. non-attenders to a CR program
which were consecutively discharged from two tertiary hospitals, after
STEMI, NSTEMI, CABG with or without valve surgery or planned PCI,
between 1/1/2009 and 31/12/2010.
Per-protocol,
in
one
hospital
all
patients
discharged
from
Cardiovascular Department were referred to ambulatory Cardiac
Rehabilitation Division with a scheduled visit reported on discharge letter.
These patients were unselected, only who were not residents in the re-
gion or with severe non-cardiac comorbidities such as end-stage
tumours, dementia, or immobilized patients, were excluded. In our popu-
lation, only 13% of eligible patients did not attend CR.
According to guidelines, patients were enrolled in CR early after dis-
charge: STEMI and CABG patients were convened to the first evaluation
within 2 weeks, while NSTEMI and PCI in 4 weeks. At the first CR visit,
the clinical profile of the patients, the risk factors, and comorbidities were
evaluated and the CR program planned.
In the other tertiary hospital, all patients discharged after STEMI,
NSTEMI, CABG, or planned PCI did not receive any CR because CR ser-
vice was not available. This group is composed by consecutive and unse-
lected patients.
The Ambulatory Rehabilitation Programme
The CR program was performed in a dedicated Cardiac Rehabilitation
Division.
The NSTEMI or PCI patients received clinical-instrumental evaluations
until achievement of therapeutic and clinical targets, with scheduled visits,
cycle-ergometer tests, and echocardiogram. ST-elevation myocardial in-
farction and CABG patients, in addition, were sent to a physical activity,
consisting in a first part of 10 sessions of 45min of cyclette training two
time a week for 5 weeks, and a second part of 18 sessions of 45min of
gym training three time a week for 6 weeks. The average duration of the
CR program for the whole population was 5 months.
There were three different levels of physical activity: low, medium, and
high. A maximal effort test was used to assess exercise capacity of
patients, for insert them in appropriate level of work. The physical session
was supervised by a trained nurse and physiotherapist, with continuous
cardiac monitoring assessment. Moreover, the CR program was tailored
for ‘frail’ patients, such as very old patients (>80 years) or affected by sev-
eral comorbidities and functional limitations, with specific physical exer-
cises, clinical, and instrumental evaluations. Each patient had a personal
portfolio in which were reported the intensity of exercise and the clinical
parameters registered during the physical activity. Patients and physio-
therapists could evaluate mutually all progresses or areas of improve-
ment. In this way, the patient played an active role on its health care and
the adherence to physical program was promoted.
All groups received counselling about lifestyle during every visit and a
nutritional meeting with the nutritionist was scheduled one time a month.
Active smokers were assisted by the psychologist in a tailored program
to quit smoking. The psychologist was dedicated also to support patients
that had difficulty to accept their disease.
After CR, all patients were referred to cardiology ambulatory service,
where were periodically visited. This network has permitted a long
follow-up of the patients.
Outcomes
The primary outcome of this study was the 5-year composite endpoint
incidence of hospitalization for cardiovascular causes and cardiovascular
mortality.
Vital status and hospitalization where collected through a regional
medical record system and
E-Chart including data collected during routine clinical practice.
Clinical, echocardiographic, and biohumoral data were extracted from
the Cardiac Rehabilitation Division Registry,18,19 for the CR attenders
group and from the electronic medical record of Sanitary System for
non-attenders to CR.
The study was approved by the institutional review committee and
was performed in accordance with the 2000 revised Declaration of
Helsinki.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation or as
median with interquartile range for continuous variables depending on
the distribution shape. For continuous variables, differences between two
groups were compared using Student’s t-test or Mann–Whitney U test.
Categorical variables were expressed as counts and percentages and
compared by v2 test or Fisher’s exact test, when appropriate.
In order to evaluate the prognostic value of attenders CR program vs.
non-attenders, we performed a primary analysis using multivariable re-
gression model and a secondary analysis using the propensity score
approach.
In the primary analysis, we used univariable and multivariable Cox pro-
portional hazards regression analysis to calculate unadjusted and adjusted
hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
In the secondary analysis, we used a propensity score matching
method to reduce the confounding effect due to differences in demo-
graphics between the CR participation group and the non-participation
group.20 We estimated a propensity score in order to create 1:1 matched
data set (non-rehabilitation vs. rehabilitation) and the covariates consid-
ered for balance were age, sex, hypertension, left ventricular ejection
fraction (LVEF), diabetes, smoking, dyslipidaemia, chronic kidney disease,
previous PCI, previous acute coronary syndrome (ACS), beta-blockers,
ACE-inhibitors/ARBs, and Statins/Ezetimibe.
Survival curves in the matched data set were estimated by the Kaplan–
Meier method and compared by log-rank tests. The statistical analysis
was performed using the IBM-SPSS version 21 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp)
and the R software version 3.3.2 libraries ‘rgenoud’ and ‘Matching’

Results
Baseline characteristics of attenders and
non-attenders
Baseline characteristics of the two groups are presented in Table 1.
From 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010, 839 patients attended a
CR
program,
while
441
patients
were
discharged
from
Cardiovascular Department without any program of CR.
Compared with those who did not attend the CR program,
attenders were less frequently male (68% vs. 75% P = 0.010), were
older (68 ± 11 vs. 66 ± 12years, P < 0.001) with more prevalence of
risk factors and comorbidities such as hypertension (76% vs. 68%,
P = 0.001), smoking (26% vs. 18%, P = 0.001), dyslipidaemia (73% vs.
44%, p= <0.001) and chronic renal failure (14% vs. 9%, P = 0.012);
however, attenders presented less frequently history of previous
ACS (18% vs. 27%, P < 0.001) and previous PCI (12% vs. 20%,
P < 0.001). Both groups had a mean LVEF above 50% and patients
attending CR had a higher LVEF compared to no attenders (56 ± 11 vs.
52 ± 9 P< 0.001). In both groups, there were not differences on the
enrolment diagnosis (STEMI, NSTEMI, PCI, and CABG). We reported
the features of all subgroups in Supplementary material online,
Table S1. Only 3.8% of attenders have not completed the program.
Outcomes
During follow-up, median 82months, interquartile range [60–89], CR
group compared to no-CR group experienced a lower incidence of
the composite endpoint of hospitalizations for cardiovascular causes
and cardiovascular mortality (18% vs. 30%, P < 0.01), however this
difference was driven by lower hospitalizations for cardiovascular
causes (15% vs. 27%, P < 0.01) (Table 2). The overall incidence of all-
cause mortality (17% vs. 18% in CR vs. no-CR groups, respectively,
P = 0.861) and cardiovascular mortality (6% vs. 6%, P = 0.623) were
similar in both groups. The multivariable Cox proportional hazard
analysis showed that participation in CR program [hazard ratio (HR)
0.578, 95% CI 0.432–0.773; P < 0.001], CABG (HR 0.639, 95% CI
0.466 to 0.876; P = 0.005), LVEF (HR 0.986, 95% CI 0.973–0.0.999;
P = 0.035) and statin/ezetimibe therapy (HR 0.518, 95% CI 0.345–
0.776; P = 0.001) were independent predictors of lower occurrence
of the composite primary outcome, while diabetes (HR 1.460; 95%
CI, 1.107 to 1.926, P = 0.007) and chronic kidney disease (HR 2.441;
95% CI 1.775 to 3.358, P < 0.001) were independently associated
with worse outcome (Table 3). Estimated survival curves from the
Cox model for different types of ‘typical’ patients are shown in Figure 1.
Applying the propensity-matched analysis (Table 4), CR group,
compared to non-CR group, experienced a lower composite end-
point (hospitalizations for cardiovascular causes and cardiovascular
mortality) (13% vs. 29%, P < 0.001) or hospitalizations for cardiovas-
cular causes (11% vs. 25% P < 0.001). Moreover, both total mortality
(10% vs. 19%, P = 0.002) and cardiovascular mortality (7% vs. 2%,
P = 0.008) were lower in CR group compared to no-CR group (Table
5, Figure 2A,B). Because it was not possible to obtain a match for varia-
bles ‘STEMI’ and ‘NSTEMI’, we estimated the Kaplan–Meier curves
on matched data stratified for these two parameters in order to
evaluate the effect of CR. The Kaplan–Meier curves related to the
composite endpoint, cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization,
stratified for STEMI are presented in Supplementary material online,
Figure S1, stratified for the NSTEMI are presented in Supplementary

had a significant effect on the prognosis. The relation between values
of LVEF and outcome is represented in the Supplementary material
online, Figure S3.
Similarly, the Kaplan–Meier curves related to the composite end-
point, cardiovascular mortality, and hospitalization, stratified for the
previous NSTEMI = 0 or NSTEMI = 1 (Supplementary material on-
line, Figure S3) and the Kaplan–Meier curves about hospitalization
stratified for the previous NSTEMI = 0 or NSTEMI = 1
(Supplementary material online, Figure S4) confirmed that non-CR
group had the worse prognosis despite the difference in previous is-
chaemic cardiovascular events. Finally, the Kaplan–Meier curves
stratified for LVEF < or >
_ 50% are presented in Supplementary ma-
terial online, Figure S5, both showing the significant better outcomes
of CR group compared to non-CR group.
Discussion
This study, performed on a large cohort of patients, showed that CR
participation was independently associated with a reduction of a
composite endpoint of hospitalizations for cardiovascular causes and
cardiovascular mortality during the first 5 years following an ACS or
coronary revascularization.
This study confirmed the efficacy of an ambulatory CR in an unse-
lected real-world population and showed as the evaluation of a CR

program in a geographic area is an essential safeguard to ensure that
CR service is delivered effectively. Indeed, the rigorous analysis of the
results, highlighted the importance of the utilization of CR, encourag-
ing all Cardiovascular Department to adopt CR as an integral part of
standard of care in modern cardiology.
Multiple studies have focused on outcome effects of CR, however,
trials were conducted on small population of patients and most of
them assessed only combined endpoints or surrogate endpoints and
actually, these studies are older than 20years. For these reasons,
results about the impact of CR on coronary patients are derived
mainly from meta-analyses. The most recent Cochrane systematic
review and meta-analysis on 63 studies with 14 486 participants to
CR showed a reduction in pooled cardiovascular mortality and
hospital admission with exercise-based CR compared with no-
exercise control groups.12
In our primary analysis, we showed a significant reduction in hospi-
talizations and in the combined endpoint of hospitalizations and car-
diovascular mortality, but we did not observe a statistically significant
reduction in cardiovascular mortality alone, and there was not differ-
ence in total mortality, as the Cochrane meta-analysis reported.
In our first analysis, the smaller population, together with the po-
tential presence of unmeasured confounders may account for the ab-
sence of a clear mortality benefit between the two groups. However
is interesting to note that when we used a propensity score matching
method to reduce the confounding effect due to differences in demo-
graphics between the CR participation group and the non-
participation group,20 the value of CR was highlighted also in terms of
reduction of cardiovascular and total mortality confirming the poten-
tial survival benefit of patients attending a CR program12,21 also in the
modern era of treatment of coronary artery disease.22
In our study, we showed a significant reduction in hospitalizations
and in the combined endpoint of hospitalizations and cardiovascular
mortality, but we did not observe a statistically significant reduction
in cardiovascular mortality alone, and there was not difference in
total mortality, as the Cochrane meta-analysis reported. However, in
the previous Cochrane meta-analyses published in 2011, it was
observed a significant reduction also in all-causes mortality with CR
but actually, this endpoint has not been confirmed. In our population,
the absence of difference between the groups in cardiovascular mor-
tality could be related to the era in which these patients have been
enrolled. Indeed, we performed the analysis on a recent cohort who
received a modern coronary revascularization treatment and a cur-
rent optimal medical therapy, therefore the strength of CR interven-
tion could be more evident on reduction in hospital admissions.
Despite this sentence is in contrast with results of CROS study,22 the
smaller population of our study may explain the different results,
nevertheless, the reduction of hospitalizations in a real-world experi-
ence is certainly relevant and has an import clinical impact for
patients’ care.
Moreover, our analysis, were performed on a long-term follow-up,
and permitted to demonstrate the long-term benefits of CR. Indeed,
the Kaplan–Meier curves diverged mainly at the end of follow-up
period, suggesting that the CR is effective for a long time after the
treatment. The Cochrane meta-analysis, while confirming the efficacy
of CR, underlined that the median follow-up of the published studies
was 12months with only 18 studies reporting a follow-up of
36months or more.12 Therefore, the long-term association between
CR attendance and clinical outcomes has been studied rarely.23
Importantly the results of our study were obtained, according to
the international guidelines, with a strategy of early enrolment in
which eligible patients were referred to CR with a scheduled visit
reported on the discharge letter and within a brief time from hospi-
talization, in order to avoid any selection of eligible patients and to
have a high level of attendance. Indeed, the time of referral plays a
key role on the CR attendance. Retrospective studies suggested that

for every day of delay between hospital discharge and CR, there is an
associated 1% decrease in participation24 and Pack et al.25 found a sig-
nificant 18% absolute and 56% relative improvement in attendance in
the group of patients with early appointment to CR. A recent study
published by Mayo Clinic showed that through the use of system-
based approaches for CR referral, consistently increase the enrol-
ment of patients.26
Interestingly the results of this study occurred in an unselected
population in which were enrolled also elderly patients including very
old patients (>80years) who received a tailored CR program for their
‘fragility’, comorbidities, and functional limitations. Furthermore, it has
to be noted that hospitalization for cardiovascular cause were reduced
in the CR group, thus preventing cardiovascular outcomes and suggest-
ing that CR might reduce also the health care cost. It has been esti-
mated that Cost-effectiveness of CR ranged from an additional US
$42 535/quality-adjusted life-year27 to a reduction of US $650/quality-
adjusted life-year for CR compared with control subjects.28
Despite these evidences supporting the benefits of CR programs,
this service is greatly underutilized, especially by women, elderly, and
diabetic patients.29–31 Referral and participation range between 30%
and 50% in Europe and it is around 25% in USA.12,15 Suaya et al.13
reported that CR was used in only 14% of elderly patients after ACS
and 31% after CABG and less than 30% CR uptake in women are
reported by Peek et al.,32 while in the study of Mezenes et al.33 only
20% of eligible diabetic patients are referred to CR.
There are several reasons for inadequate use of CR. Firstly, in
most of cases patients do not receive appropriate information and
encouragement to attend CR by physician and other health profes-
sionals; this should be done, as in our study, directly during hospital
discharge.
Another important consideration concerns the adherence of the
full CR program. It has been demonstrated that 36 sessions of CR are
associated with lower risks of death and ACS at 4 years compared
with fewer than 36 sessions,10 but a lot of patients leave the CR pro-
gram within the first sessions. This event occurs especially in sub-
groups of high risk patients. Diabetics patients, for example, are less
likely to complete the full course of CR compared to non-diabetic
individuals (41% vs. 56%; P < 0.001) and a meta-analysis revealed a
sex difference of 4% (68.6% to 64.2% for men and women, respect-
ively) in adherence to CR programs longer than 12 weeks’ duration.
The main consequence is that only few patients reach the targets
indicated in the guidelines, as reported in the latest analysis of
EUROASPIRE series.34 In our study, the use of 10 session of 45min
of cyclette training two time a week for 5 weeks, and a second part of
12 session of 45min of gym training three time a week for 6 weeks
with an average duration of the CR program of 5 months has been ef-
fective in reducing cardiovascular outcome and may be suggested as
a useful approach to adopt. It is important to highlight that in our CR
program the supervision of the physical activity required only trained
health care professionals that were involved during the physical ses-
sions and a 12-derivations ECG telemetry. This is a simple but effi-
cient methods that can be adopted without the use of expensive
resources and can be applied in any ambulatory CR centre.
Novel strategies to promote the use and adherence to CR are
now investigated with a greater emphasis on home training in com-
bination with intermittent home visits or telephone conferencing/
assessments, or both, to reinforce safety and compliance.35 Home-
based and facility-based programs have shown similar benefits of low-
ering risk factors, increasing quality of life, and reducing clinical
events,36 but further studies are needed.

Study limitations
Our findings should be interpreted in light of the common limitations
of retrospective observational studies; however, the ‘Observational
Cardiac Rehabilitation Division Registry’ was built and prospectively
filled in order to periodically evaluate and monitor the epidemiology
and the efficacy of the ambulatory CR program. The results of this
study derived from a single centre CR program with its own specific
CR protocols; however, the CR program in our institution is inspired
and follows strictly the international guidelines recommendations.
We did not collect information about adherence on pharmaco-
logical therapy; however, despite non-attenders presented at dis-
charged a higher frequency of evidence-based therapy prescription
compared to attenders, this was not translated in better outcomes;
one could speculate that lower adherence of therapy was present in
non-attenders group; however, adherence of therapy was not the aim
of our study and further dedicated studies should be performed in the
future. An accurate analysis on arrhythmias was not possible; how-
ever, a protective role of CR independently from LVEF, and the well-
known association between arrhythmias and LVEF in patients with is-
chaemic cardiomyopathy, makes a relevant and different impact of
the arrhythmias between the two groups unlikely. Finally, a number of
behavioural factors and attitudes that might affect attendance at CR,
data related to socio-economical characteristics of patients and
parameters to assess the variation in quality of life were not evaluated.
Conclusions
This study, conducted in a large cohort of patients, demonstrated the
positive effects of a modern multidisciplinary CR program in the real
world showing a decreased risk of cardiovascular hospitalizations and
cardiovascular mortality during a long-term follow-up.
The results of our analysis support the clinical practice guidelines
that consider CR an integral part in the treatment of coronary artery
disease. All patients should be referred to a CR program after an
ACS or coronary revascularization with particular consideration for
elderly, diabetics, and women, improving the time of enrolment, ac-
cessibility, and adherence to CR.
