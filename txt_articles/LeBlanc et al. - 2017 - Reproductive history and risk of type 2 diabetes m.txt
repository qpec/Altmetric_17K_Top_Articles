Abstract
Objective—To understand the association between women’s reproductive history and their risk 
of developing type 2 diabetes. We hypothesized that characteristics signifying lower cumulative 
endogenous estrogen exposure would be associated with increased risk.
Methods—Prospective cohort analysis of 124,379 postmenopausal women aged 50–79 from the 
Women’s Health Initiative. We determined age of menarche and final menstrual period, and

 history of irregular menses from questionnaires at baseline, and calculated reproductive length 
from age of menarche and final menstrual period. Presence of new onset type 2 diabetes was from 
self-report. Using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, we assessed associations 
between reproductive variables and incidence of type 2 diabetes.
Results—In age-adjusted models, women with the shortest (<30 years) reproductive periods had 
a 37% (95% CI = 30–45%) greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes than women with medium-
length reproductive periods (36 to 40 years). Women with the longest (45+ years) reproductive 
periods had a 23% (95% CI = 12–37%) higher risk than women with medium-length periods. 
These associations were attenuated after full adjustment (HR of 1.07 [1.01, 1.14] for shortest and 
HR of 1.09 [0.99, 1.22] for longest, compared to medium duration). Those with a final menstrual 
period before age 45 and after age 55 had an increased risk of diabetes (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.99, 
1.09 and HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01, 1.14, respectively) compared to those with age of final menstrual 
period between 46 and 55. Timing of menarche and cycle regularity were not associated with risk 
after full adjustment.
Conclusions—Reproductive history may be associated with type 2 diabetes risk. Women with 
shorter and longer reproductive periods may benefit from lifestyle counseling to prevent type 2 
diabetes.

Introduction
In animal models, oophorectomy leads to visceral obesity and development of metabolic 
syndrome.1 In vitro, estrogens have been shown to have metabolic actions on skeletal 
muscle, pancreas, adipose tissue, and the central nervous system.1 In particular, low levels of 
estrogen tend to adversely affect body fat distribution and accumulation, appetite, energy 
expenditure, insulin secretion, and glucose homeostasis,1,2 critical contributors to the 
development of type 2 diabetes. In humans, however, exogenous estrogen has been 
associated with reversal of these symptoms, including positive effects on body fat and 
energy expenditure, and prevention of diabetes,1,3–5 although exogenous estrogen may have 
different effects due to the different route, dose and timing of administration.6
Reproductive factors such as age of menarche, age of menopause, and cycle irregularity can 
serve as proxies for endogenous estrogen exposure. Earlier age of menarche and later age of 
menopause have been associated with an increased risk of insulin resistance and type 2 
diabetes in some,7–11 but not all,12,13 studies. A history of bilateral oophorectomy, which 
would result in a shortened reproductive period, and earlier menopause, have also been 
associated with less favorable glucose and insulin levels,14,15 and increased risk of type 2 
diabetes in some,13,16 but not all,12,17–20 studies. Menstrual cycle characteristics such as 
length and regularity of menstrual cycle have also been associated with gestational diabetes 
and glucose intolerance in some,21–23 but not all,13,24 studies.

 Many of these previous studies were limited by small sample sizes and lack of rigorous, 
prospective ascertainment of type 2 diabetes. Because of its large size, robust 
characterization of participants’ reproductive history, long duration of follow-up, and 
prospective ascertainment of diabetes, the Women’s Health Initiative provides a unique 
setting to evaluate the association between reproductive characteristics and type 2 diabetes. 
In the current study, we examined the hypothesis that reproductive-factor characteristics 
consistent with lower lifelong endogenous estrogen (shorter reproductive period over the 
lifetime and history of irregular menses) would be associated with increased risk of type 2 
diabetes.
Methods
Study population
The Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) is a large, multicenter study evaluating effects of 
postmenopausal hormone therapy, diet modification, and calcium and vitamin D 
supplements on heart disease, fractures, and breast and colorectal cancer, as well as factors 
contributing to cardiovascular disease, cancer, osteoporosis (the most common causes of 
death, disability, and poor quality of life in this population). The study has been described in 
detail previously.25,26 Briefly, postmenopausal women between 50 and 79 years of age who 
were accessible for follow-up, with a minimum life expectancy of 3 years, were recruited 
between September 1, 1993, and December 31, 1998, at 40 clinical sites. The WHI clinical 
trials enrolled a total of 68,132 women, and 93,676 were enrolled in an observational study. 
The clinical trials (CTs) were designed to test the effects of postmenopausal hormone 
therapy, dietary modification, and calcium and vitamin D supplements on cardiovascular 
disease, fractures, and breast and colorectal cancer. The observational study (OS) enrolled 
women who were recruited but did not meet eligibility criteria for or did not wish to 
participate in one of the randomized trials. All clinical centers obtained institutional review 
board approval, and all women provided written informed consent.
In this study, all CT and OS women were included except those who reported a history of 
diabetes at baseline. Women who were missing the outcome, any of the exposure variables, 
or the covariates included in our models were excluded from the primary analyses.
Data collection
Full details of data collection have been published previously.25 Briefly, at baseline, 
participants completed questionnaires on demographics, medical and family history, and 
various lifestyle factors such as physical activity. Height, weight, and waist circumference 
were measured by trained clinic staff and used to determine body mass index (BMI). At 
baseline and some follow-up visits, participants were asked to bring all current, regularly 
taken medications (prescription and over-the-counter) to their clinic visits. After 2005, 
women were asked to complete the medication inventory by mail. Clinic interviewers 
entered each medication name and strength directly from the containers into a computer-
driven medication system that assigned drug codes using Medi-Span software (First 
DataBank, Inc., San Bruno, CA).

 Ascertainment of reproductive exposures
Information on reproductive history was collected using a questionnaire at baseline (from 
1993–1998). Participants were asked about age at menarche (“how old were you when you 
had your first menstrual period [menses]?”), age at final menstrual period (“how old were 
you when you last had regular menstrual bleeding [a period]?”), history of irregular periods 
(“during most of your life, were your periods regular; that is, did they occur about once a 
month? [Do not include any time when you were pregnant or taking birth control pills.]”), 
surgical menopause history, and number of pregnancies. Reproductive-period duration (in 
years) was determined by subtracting age of menarche from age at final menstrual period.
Identification of women with type 2 diabetes
The primary outcome for this study was new diagnosis of diabetes. Diabetes status was 
determined through medical histories and medication inventories. Participants were asked at 
baseline and annually, “Did a doctor ever say that you had sugar diabetes or high blood 
sugar when you were not pregnant?” In addition, they were asked, “Since the date given on 
this form, has a doctor prescribed any of the following pills or treatments?” Choices 
included “pills for diabetes” and “insulin shots for diabetes.” Diabetes diagnosis was further 
identified through use of diabetes medications on the medication inventory. This definition 
has been validated in the WHI study and is consistent with medication inventories and 
fasting glucose measurements.27
Women in the study were followed from randomization (CT) or enrollment (OS) until the 
first time they responded yes to these three questions. Participants who did not develop 
diabetes during the period of study were censored at last study follow-up. Participants who 
died were censored at death.
Measurement of covariates
Considered covariates include baseline information on age (50–54, 55–59, 60–69, 70–79), 
race (white, Hispanic, black, other), BMI (<18.5, 18.5 to <25, 25 to <30, >=30 kg/m2), waist 
circumference (cm), education (less than high school, high school, college), marital status 
(never married, marriage-like relationship, presently married, divorced or separated, 
widowed), physical activity (baseline MET-min/week: <100; 100–500; 500–1200; >1200), 
smoking status (never/past/current smoker), alcohol use (<1 drink/week, 1–3 drinks/week, 
>3 drinks/week), hormone therapy (HT) intervention arm (not randomized to HT; estrogen 
plus progestin (E+P) intervention; E+P control; E-alone intervention; E alone control), 
postmenopausal HT use (never, past, now), oral contraceptive use (yes, no), metformin use 
(yes, no), family history of diabetes, years since final menstrual period, and number of full-
term pregnancies (none, 1–2, >3).
Incidence of diabetes outcome
The primary outcome of this study was a new diagnosis of diabetes; women with a previous 
diagnosis of diabetes were excluded from analyses.

 Exposure variables
The primary exposure was reproductive-period duration over a lifetime (age of final 
menstrual period minus age at menarche in years). This was examined both as a continuous 
variable and categorical variable categorized by length in years (<30, 30–35, 36–40, 41–45, 
45+). These categories were chosen to be clinically meaningful and equally spaced. 
Secondary exposures included history of irregular periods (not regular, sometimes regular, 
regular), menarche timing by age (<12, 12, >12),28,29 and timing of final menstrual period 
by age (<45, 45–55, and >55).28,30
Statistical analysis
Means and standard deviations or frequency distributions were calculated for baseline 
variables by categories of the reproductive-period duration categories. We examined Kaplan-
Meier curves displayed by categories of the reproductive-period duration for time-to-event 
outcomes with censoring.
Cox proportional hazards techniques were used to estimate unadjusted and age-adjusted 
associations between the reproductive-period duration and incidence of type 2 diabetes. We 
also fit multivariable models to obtain effects adjusted for important covariates: age, race, 
baseline BMI, HT intervention arm membership, baseline physical activity, baseline alcohol 
consumption, baseline smoking history, education, baseline marital status, number of term 
pregnancies, family history of diabetes, years since final menstrual period at baseline, 
baseline waist circumference, ever use of oral contraceptives at baseline, and baseline 
metformin use. We also conducted analyses to separately assess the association of the age of 
menarche, age at final menstrual period, and cycle irregularity with risk of type 2 diabetes. 
Kaplan-Meier curves were used to check the assumption of proportional hazards. All tests 
were two-sided and conducted at the alpha=0.05 level of significance.
Because of their potential to modify the association between reproductive history and 
diabetes risk, we evaluated whether the following variables were effect modifiers: number of 
pregnancies (0, 1–2, 3+), baseline BMI category (0–18.5, 18.5– 25, 25–<30, ≥30 kg/m2), 
postmenopausal HT use (ever vs. never), randomization to hormone therapy arm (yes or no), 
type of menopause (surgical [hysterectomy and/or oophorectomy] vs. natural), family 
history of diabetes (yes or no), randomization to dietary modification arm (yes or no), and 
randomization to calcium and vitamin D arm (yes or no). The variables considered as 
potential effect modifiers were specified a priori. We added a statistical interaction term 
between each potential effect modifier and the exposure of interest to the models. We did not 
adjust for multiple comparisons, as these analyses were exploratory in nature and need 
careful interpretation and subsequent follow-up.
In a sensitivity analysis, we included women who had missing exposure or confounder 
variables and refit the primary models using multiple imputations via the predictive mean 
matching method. All analyses were performed with SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, 
NC).

 Results
Description of cohort
Of the 161,808 participants in the OS and CT cohorts, 9,728 were excluded because of a 
history of diabetes at baseline, 21,479 were missing confounding covariates, and 6,224 were 
missing outcome or exposure data. This left an analytic cohort of 124,379 participants for 
the primary analysis (Figure 1). Also, data from 152,080 women were used to fit the models 
using multiple imputations in the sensitivity analysis, where we included women missing 
exposure or confounder variables. Women were followed for a mean (SD) of 12.2 (4.2) 
years. The unadjusted incidence of diabetes was 7.4/1,000 person-years.
Baseline characteristics
Baseline characteristics by reproductive duration category are shown in Table 1. Compared 
to women with shorter reproductive durations, women with the longest reproductive-period 
duration were older at the baseline visit and less likely to be Black. They had achieved a 
higher education level, were less likely to be past or current smokers, were more physically 
active, and drank more alcoholic beverages per week. The association between reproductive 
period and BMI and waist circumference was U-shaped, with those with the shortest and 
longest reproductive period having higher BMIs and waist circumference compared to those 
with mid-range reproductive lengths. Women with shorter reproductive-period duration were 
more likely to have undergone surgical menopause and more likely to be current or past 
users of HT. Women with longer reproductive-period duration were less likely to have ever 
used oral contraceptives. Very few had used metformin as it was not approved by the FDA 
for diabetes until 1994. About one-third had a family history of diabetes. Women with 
longer reproductive-period durations had more term pregnancies. Those with shorter 
reproductive duration had more irregular cycles. As expected, women with longer 
reproductive-period duration were more likely to have had an early menarche and a late 
menopause. Women with longer reproductive-period duration had been menopausal for a 
shorter amount of time before study entry.
Reproductive-period duration and type 2 diabetes risk
Over 974,714 person-years of follow-up, 11,262 women reported new diagnoses of type 2 
diabetes mellitus. In Cox-proportional hazards models, there was a statistically significant 
association between reproductive-period duration and type 2 diabetes risk (fully adjusted 
p=0.04). The relationship was U-shaped in that women with both the shortest (<30 years), 
and longest (more than 45 years) reproductive-period durations were at higher risk of 
developing type 2 diabetes during the study period than those with reproductive-period 
durations in the middle (36–40 years) (Figure 2A). In age adjusted models, women with the 
shortest reproductive-period durations (<30 years) had a 37% (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.30, 1.45) 
increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes relative to women whose reproductive-period 
durations were in the middle (36–40 years) (Table 2). After adjustment for multiple 
covariates, women with the shortest reproductive-period durations still had a significantly 
greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes than those with reproductive-period durations in 
the middle, although the risk estimates were somewhat attenuated (HR 1.07; 95% CI 1.01, 
1.14).

 Compared to women whose reproductive-period durations were in the middle (36–40 years), 
women with the longest reproductive-period durations (more than 45 years) had a 23% (HR 
1.23; 95% CI 1.12, 1.37) increased risk of type 2 diabetes in age-adjusted models. After full 
adjustment, women with the longest reproductive-period durations had a 9% (HR 1.09 95% 
CI 0.99, 1.21) greater risk of type 2 diabetes than those with reproductive durations in the 
middle.
As with reproductive-period duration, the association between menopausal timing and risk 
of type 2 diabetes was U-shaped (Table 2; fully adjusted p=0.02). Women who experienced 
their final menstrual period before 46 years of age as well as those who experienced their 
final menstrual period after age 55 were at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes during 
the study period compared to those who had a final menstrual period between ages 46 and 
55. In age-adjusted models, those who experienced their final menstrual period before age 
46 were 25% (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.20, 1.30) more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than 
those experiencing their final menstrual period between the ages of 46 and 55. Those who 
had their final menstrual period after age 55 were 12% (HR 1.12, 95%CI 1.06, 1.18) more 
likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those with a final menstrual period occurring between 
ages 46 and 55. After full adjustment for additional covariates, the risk estimates for the 
development of type 2 diabetes remained elevated for both those with a final menstrual 
period before age 45 (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.99, 1.09) and those with a final menstrual period 
after age 55 (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01, 1.14) compared to those with final menstrual periods 
between ages 46 and 55.
Lower age at menarche was associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes 
in age adjusted models (Table 2). Women who experienced menarche before age 12 had an 
increased risk of type 2 diabetes in age-adjusted models (HR 1.14 95% CI 1.08, 1.20) 
compared to those who experienced menarche at age 12. On the other hand, women with 
menarche after 12 years of age had a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes in age-adjusted (HR 
0.93 95% CI 0.89, 0.97) models compared to those who experienced menarche at 12 years 
of age. However, the associations were no longer significant after full adjustment (HR 1.01 
95% CI 0.95, 1.06 and HR 0.99 95% CI 0.95, 1.04 for menarche at <12 years and >12 years, 
respectively).
History of irregular cycles was associated with risk of developing type 2 diabetes (Figure 
2B). In age-adjusted models, women with irregular cycles had an 11% increased risk of type 
2 diabetes compared to women with regular cycles (Table 2; HR 1.11 95% CI = 1.04, 1.19). 
However, cycle regularity was no longer associated with type 2 diabetes risk after full 
adjustment (fully adjusted p=0.46). After full adjustment, women with irregular cycles no 
longer had a significantly increased risk of developing diabetes (HR 1.04 95% CI = 0.97, 
1.11) compared to women with regular cycles.
In a sensitivity analysis, we found that the results did not change when we used multiple 
imputed data instead of excluding women who were missing data. We examined several 
effect modifiers including number of previous pregnancies, age at first birth, menopause 
type (surgical vs. natural), BMI, postmenopausal HT use, randomization to HT arm, family 
history of diabetes, randomization to diet modification trial arm, and randomization to

 calcium/vitamin D trial arm (data not shown). No effect modifiers were found to be 
statistically significant.
Discussion
As hypothesized, we found that women with short reproductive-period durations (<30 years) 
had an increased risk of type 2 diabetes compared to women whose reproductive durations 
were in the middle (36–40 years). Surprisingly, women with long (>45 years) reproductive-
period durations were also more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. When the components of 
reproductive-period duration were examined separately, age at final menstrual period, not 
age at menarche, was associated with type 2 diabetes risk, in a U-shaped pattern similar to 
the association with reproductive-period duration. Women with irregular cycles were not at 
greater risk of developing diabetes.
These findings have important implications given the high prevalence of type 2 diabetes in 
postmenopausal women. Among adults in the United States, the estimated overall 
prevalence of diabetes ranges from 5.8% to 12.9% (median 8.4%).31 Therefore, the 
increased risk associated with reproductive characteristics noted in this study (4%–9% for 
the fully adjusted models and 14%–37% for the age-adjusted models) could have significant 
clinical impact. Indeed, the absolute risk increase for women with a long reproductive period 
(>45 years) was 1.6 events per 1000 person-years, and the absolute risk increase for those 
with a short reproductive period (<30 years) was 2.5 events per 1000 person-years. This 
suggests important public health benefits to targeting modifiable risk factor reduction advice 
to women whose reproductive history suggests they may be at greater risk for developing 
type 2 diabetes.
Our finding that a shorter reproductive duration and earlier menopause were associated with 
increased type 2 diabetes risk is consistent with a previous report from Europe. In that 
nested, prospective case-cohort study of more than 8,000 postmenopausal women followed 
for 11 years, there was a 6% increased risk of type 2 diabetes per standard deviation of lower 
reproductive lifespan in years.16 Shorter reproductive period is a marker for decreased 
exposure to endogenous estrogens over the lifetime. Estrogens help long term to preserve 
insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis.1,2 Low estrogen negatively affects body fat 
distribution and fat accumulation,1,2 important contributors to type 2 diabetes risk. 
Adipokines could also be contributing to the association. Adiponectin has been inversely 
associated with estradiol levels.32 Adiponectin, an adipocyte-derived cytokine, has been 
associated with better glycemic control and reduced inflammation in persons with 
diabetes.33 Low adiponectin levels have been associated with the development of insulin 
resistance and development of type 2 diabetes.34
On the other hand, later age of menopause, which leads to longer reproductive-period 
durations, has not previously been associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.12,13 
We found that having more pregnancies, which would be associated with higher lifetime 
estrogen exposure, further increased risk of type 2 diabetes in those with long reproductive-
period durations. Exogenous estrogen has been associated with unfavorable effects on 
carbohydrate metabolism.2 Previous prospective cohorts of both men and postmenopausal

 women have found that high endogenous estrogen levels are associated with increased type 
2 diabetes risk.35 Low sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), which leads to increases in 
free estradiol, has also been associated with increased diabetes risk.6 Postmenopausal 
estrogen therapy has been associated with a deterioration of glucose tolerance.36,37 
Therefore, we are expanding our original hypothesis to be that not only lower, but also 
higher, cumulative endogenous estrogen exposure leads to adverse effects on insulin and 
glucose levels and the development of type 2 diabetes. Such “U” shaped associations have 
been seen with other cardiovascular disease risk factors such as blood pressure and alcohol 
use.38,39
Unlike other studies,7–11 we did not find that earlier age at menarche was associated with an 
increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Our cutoffs for age of menarche differed slightly from 
other studies, which could have influenced our null findings. Earlier age of menarche has 
been previously associated with earlier age of final menstrual period, which is why we 
controlled for years since final menstrual period.40 While some previous studies included 
menopausal status, none took into account age of final menstrual period and, as a result, 
their results may have been confounded by age of final menstrual period.
We also did not find that cycle irregularity was associated with type 2 diabetes risk in fully 
adjusted models. This was surprising given that women with polycystic ovarian syndrome 
(PCOS), which is characterized by irregular cycles, have been shown to have an increased 
risk of type 2 diabetes. We hypothesize that since women with polycystic ovary syndrome 
have a substantially earlier age of type 2 diabetes onset (third to fourth decades) than in the 
general population (sixth to seventh decades),41 many women with PCOS may have 
developed type 2 diabetes prior to the start of the observation period (and thus were 
ineligible for the study).
Our study had several strengths. We prospectively followed women for the diagnosis of 
diabetes, which was based on medical history and medication inventory. We had a large 
sample size, which gave us sufficient power to detect important associations. Although we 
excluded women who were missing confounder data in the primary analysis, we included all 
women in a sensitivity analysis using multiple imputations to avoid potential bias due to 
missing data.
Our study also had several limitations. In particular, women were asked to recall age of 
menarche and cycle irregularity, which occurred in what they may have considered the 
distant past and could have resulted in measurement error. However, we would not expect 
differential recall between groups. Because medically diagnosed diabetes was not available 
for all WHI women and we did not have data on glucose measurements at baseline or 
follow-up, we used self-reported diabetes; however, self-reports of “treated diabetes” in 
WHI have been shown to be sufficiently accurate to allow use in epidemiologic studies such 
as this one.27 We used the date that a woman reported diabetes instead of the date of 
diabetes diagnosis, which was not available. We did not evaluate the effects of several other 
factors that could be associated with diabetes risk, including PCOS, infertility, lactation, or 
gestational diabetes.

 Conclusion
Our study found that both shorter and longer reproductive-duration lengths are associated 
with increased risk of type 2 diabetes. This suggests that lifetime estrogen exposure may 
play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes—there may be an “optimal” amount of 
estrogen exposure for metabolic functioning, although exogenous estrogen may have 
different effects due to different route, dose and timing of administration.6 If other 
prospective studies confirm these findings, future research should focus on possible 
mechanisms in order to determine ways to prevent type 2 diabetes as women age. 
Understanding who is at risk for type 2 diabetes is important because preventive measures 
such as weight loss, improved dietary quality and increased exercise can decrease risk. 
Endogenous sex hormones had previously been thought to be markers of adiposity. 
However, this study adds to the growing literature suggesting that endogenous sex hormone 
biomarkers could potentially add predictive risk information above and beyond obesity. 
Reproductive period length and age of final menstrual period may be important factors to 
add to the risk pool when counseling women about their risk of diabetes and the need to 
make lifestyle changes.

aCox proportional hazards techniques were used to estimate associations.
bFully adjusted model includes age, race, baseline BMI, hormone therapy (HT) intervention arm membership, baseline physical activity, baseline alcohol consumption, baseline smoking history, education, 
baseline marital status, number of term pregnancies, family history of diabetes, years since menopause at baseline, baseline waist circumference, history of oral contraceptive use at baseline, and baseline 
metformin use.
cp values correspond to the fully adjusted models and reflect likelihood ratio tests of significance for the indicated exposure variable.
