Summary
Stereotactic body radiation
therapy offers a cost-
effective method to escalate
dose in early-stage prostate
cancer. Although results
from single-institution series
are promising, mature data
from large multicenter trials
are lacking. We treated,
across 21 centers, 309 pa-
tients with low- and
intermediate-risk prostate
Purpose: The radiobiology of prostate cancer may favor the extreme hypofractiona-
tion inherent in stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT); however, data from a large
multicenter study are lacking. We therefore examined the hypothesis that dose-
escalated SBRT can be safely administered across multiple institutions, with favorable
5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates compared with historical controls.
Methods and Materials: Twenty-one centers enrolled 309 patients with prostate
adenocarcinoma: 172 with low-risk (LR) and 137 with intermediate-risk (IR) disease.
All were treated with a non-coplanar robotic SBRT platform using real-time tracking
of implanted fiducials. The prostate was prescribed 40 Gy in 5 fractions of 8 Gy. We
assessed toxicities using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)
version 3 and biochemical failure using the “nadir þ 2” definition. The study popula-
tion yielded 90% power to identify excessive (>10%) rates of grade �3 genitourinary
(GU) or gastrointestinal toxicities and, in the LR group, 80% power to show superior-
ity in DFS over a 93% historical comparison rate.

Results: At a median follow-up of 61 months, 2 LR patients (1.2%) and 2 IR patients
(1.5%) experienced grade 3 GU toxicities, far below the 10% toxicity rate deemed
excessive (upper limits of 95% confidence interval, 3.5% and 4.3%, respectively).
No grade 4 or 5 toxicities occurred. All grade 3 toxicities were GU, occurring 11 to
51 months after treatment. For the entire group, the actuarial 5-year overall survival
rate was 95.6% and the DFS rate was 97.1%. The 5-year DFS rate was 97.3% for
LR patients (superior to the 93% DFS rate for historical controls; P Z .0008; lower
limit of 95% confidence interval, 94.6%) and 97.1% for IR patients.
Conclusions: Dose-escalated prostate SBRT was administered with minimal toxicity
in this multi-institutional study. Relapse rates compared favorably with historical con-
trols. SBRT is a suitable option for LR and IR prostate cancer. � 2018 The Author(s).

Introduction
In the treatment of localized prostate cancer, increasing the
external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) dose to greater
than conventional levels (eg, 74-80 Gy) improves rates of
disease-free survival (DFS) (1, 2) but causes more toxicity
(3, 4). In unfavorable-risk patients, further dose escalation
using a brachytherapy boost increases DFS by 50%
compared with 78 Gy of EBRT (5) but also has greater
toxicity (6). In this context it is notable that radiobiological
studies of prostate cancer have suggested that treatment in
fewer, higher-dose fractions (ie, hypofractionation) may
preferentially enhance the effect of irradiation on cancer
cells relative to surrounding tissues, thus offering the po-
tential to perform dose escalation with less toxicity (7).
Studies of modest hypofractionation (3.0- to 3.4-Gy frac-
tions) have shown noninferior relapse rates compared with
conventional fractionation but to date have not shown an
improvement in rates of DFS or toxicity (8).
Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is the pre-
cise delivery of very high fractional doses of radiation.
Modern image-guided radiation therapy devices can deliver
brachytherapy-like doses while sparing adjacent normal
tissues, offering the potential for improved relapse rates and
reduced toxicity (9). The brief, 4- to 5-fraction treatment
course also offers convenience for patients, as well as cost
savings (10). Several single-institution series have demon-
strated acceptable toxicity with 35 to 36.25 Gy delivered in
5 fractions (11-13). Combined data from 8 institutions
showed 5-year DFS rates of 95% and 84% in low-risk (LR)
and intermediate-risk (IR) patients, respectively, with a
trend toward improved DFS with doses of 38 to 40 Gy (14).
However, a multicenter dose-escalation trial demonstrated
that doses > 45 Gy had unacceptably high toxicity (15).
In this study, we hypothesized that SBRT (40 Gy
delivered in 5 fractions) could be safely administered
across multiple institutions, with the rate of grade 3 to 5
toxicities not exceeding 10%, and could yield favorable
DFS rates compared with historical controls. We report
the 5-year outcomes of the largest multi-institutional
prospective trial of SBRT for organ-confined prostate can-
cer to date.
Methods and Materials
Patient eligibility and follow-up
Evaluable patients were enrolled from 21 community,
regional, and academic institutions. All sites had institu-
tional review board approval; passed central credentialing
standards; provided ongoing physics quality assurance; and
underwent SBRT training, including completion of bench-
mark treatment plans. Radiation therapy treatment plans of
initial patients were submitted for central review. Eligible
patients had previously untreated prostate adenocarcinoma,
confirmed by central pathologic review. Patients had a
Zubrod performance status of 0 to 2, no invasive malig-
nancy within 5 years, no androgen suppression within 2
months of enrollment, and an estimated prostate volume
�100 cm3. Neither prior transurethral resection of the
prostate nor baseline American Urological Association
symptom score was an exclusion criterion.
Patients were enrolled in the LR cohort (clinical stage
T1b-T2a, Gleason score �6, and prostate specific antigen
[PSA] level �10 ng/mL) or IR cohort (clinical stage T1b-
T2b with Gleason score Z 7 and PSA level �10 ng/mL or
with Gleason score �6 and PSA level >0 ng/mL but
�20 ng/mL). IR patients were subcategorized as favorable
or unfavorable per the Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK)
risk classification system (16). Patients were assessed at
baseline; on the last day of treatment; and at 1 week, 1
month, 3 months, and 6 months after treatment and every 6
months thereafter.
Radiation treatment
Planning
Treatment planning used both computed tomography and
magnetic resonance imaging. Two target doses were pre-
scribed: 40 Gy in 5 fractions to the prostate and 36.25 Gy to
Volume 102 � Number 2 � 2018

 the planning treatment volume (PTV). In LR patients, the
PTV was the prostate expanded 3 mm posteriorly and 5 mm
in other dimensions; in IR patients, the PTV included the
prostate plus 2 cm of adjacent seminal vesicles, expanded 3
to 5 mm. Hollow viscera were contoured as solid structures.
Dose-volume histogram analysis constrained normal tissue
doses as follows: volume of rectum receiving more than 36
Gy (rectum V36 Gy) <1 cm3; bowel V30 Gy <1 cm3; penile
bulb V29.5 Gy <50%; bladder V37 Gy <5 to 10 cm3; and, if
visible on imaging, prostatic urethra V47 Gy <20% and
neurovascular bundle V38 Gy <50%. Typically, 150 to 200
non-coplanar beams were used. Figure 1 presents an IR
treatment plan.
Treatment
All patients were treated with a nonisocentric robotic ra-
diation therapy platform (CyberKnife; Accuray, Sunnyvale,
CA) capable of submillimeter dose delivery (17). Three or
four prostate fiducials were tracked in real time, with
automatic correction for translational and rotational target
motion. Treatment was completed over a period of 5 to 11
days. Prophylactic alpha-blockers or anti-inflammatory
medications were not routinely prescribed. Antiandrogen
therapy was not permitted during or after SBRT.
Study endpoints
Toxicity
Physician-reported toxicities were defined using Common
Terminology Criteria forAdverseEvents (CTCAE) version3.
Adverse events occurring within 3 months of treatment were
categorized as acute toxicities, and those developing after 3
months were considered late toxicities. Second malignancies
were scored as treatment related if they arose in the SBRT
field after a posttreatment latency period of 5 years (18).
Overall survival
The failure event was death from any cause.
Disease-free survival
Failure was defined as biochemical recurrence or the
administration of any salvage, antiandrogen, or systemic
prostate cancer therapy. An increase in PSA level of �2 ng/
mL above the prior nadir was scored as a biochemical
failure, unless followed by a decline to a new nadir.
Study objectives and statistics
The primary safety objective was to determine, in both the
LR and IR cohorts, whether the 5-year incidence of patients
experiencing grade 3 to 5 toxicities exceeded 10%, a rate
deemed excessive. For both cohorts, a sample size of 101
patients yielded a 90% power of identifying an excessive
toxicity rate at the 1-sided 5% significance level. Ac-
counting for ineligible or unevaluable patients, the initial
planned enrollment was 120 patients in each subgroup; this
was increased to 129 after enrollment of ineligible patients
proved greater than first estimated. The incidence of grade
3 to 5 toxicities was monitored by the Data and Safety
Monitoring Board and compared against stopping criteria at
interim enrollments of 48, 96, and 120 patients for each
subgroup.
The
primary
efficacy
objective was
to
determine
whether, for LR patients, dose-escalated SBRT improved
5-year DFS from an expected rate of 93%dthe average
rate reported in 3 dose-escalated EBRT studies (19-21). We
hypothesized that, in LR patients, SBRT would yield a
5-year DFS rate of 97.5%; this was estimated from DFS
rates reported in high-dose-rate monotherapy series using
similar dose escalation (22, 23). To test superiority with
80% power at the 1-sided 5% significance level, a sample
size of 150 LR patients was required. After accounting for
ineligible and unevaluable patients, we planned to enroll
178 patients; this was increased to 190 after enrollment of
ineligible patients was greater than estimated.
The secondary objectives were to measure DFS in the
IR group and to estimate overall survival. Alterations in
sexual function and quality of life were assessed using

 patient-recorded validated instruments and will be reported

Follow-up time was measured from the last day of
treatment, and median follow-up was calculated using the
methodology of Schemper and Smith (24). Confidence in-
tervals for toxicity rates and efficacy were calculated using
the Wilson score method (25). The Kaplan-Meier method
was used to estimate actuarial survival (26), with standard
errors calculated using Greenwood’s formula (27).
Results
A total of 21 sites enrolled 359 patients; 50 patients were
unevaluable because they did not meet the eligibility
requirements. Of the 309 evaluable patients, 172 were
LR and 137 were IR. Patient characteristics are listed in
Table 1. Four patients received 1 to 6 months of leu-
prolide that became ineffective 3.5 to 7 months prior to
SBRT;
otherwise,
no
patients
underwent
androgen
deprivation therapy (ADT) before or during treatment.
Patients were treated between January 2008 and April
2010. The median follow-up was 61 months. At the time
of analysis, 42 patients (14%) were no longer being
followed up: 15 died, 9 withdrew from the study, and 18
were lost to follow-up.
Four patients experienced 5 grade 3 treatment-related
toxicities; no grade 4 or 5 toxicities occurred. In the LR
and IR groups, grade 3 toxicities were reported in 1.2%
and 1.5% of patients, respectively. These rates were far
below the 10% toxicity rate deemed excessive (upper
limits of 95% confidence intervals, 3.5% and 4.3%,
respectively).
Reported toxicities, categorized as acute or late, are
listed in Table 2. No acute grade 3 to 5 toxicities were
reported. Temporary catheterization for urinary retention
and/or obstruction was required in 5 patients (1.6%): 3
patients acutely (6, 7, and 14 days following treatment) and
2 patients at 8 and 10 months. Late grade 3 GU toxicities
occurred in 4 patients: hematuria in 2 patients at 21 and 51
months after treatment, urinary obstruction and associated
infection in 1 patient at 11 months, and bladder injury
requiring cystoscopy and ureteral stent placement in 1 pa-
tient at 11 months. In 7 patients, bladder cancers were
diagnosed between 21 and 50 months after treatment and
thus were not attributed to treatment.
Actuarial survival plots are shown in Fig. 2. For the
entire population, the actuarial 5-year overall survival rate
was 95.6% (Fig. 2 A); the 5-year DFS rate was 97.1%
(Fig. 2 B). Relapse occurred in 10 patients: All had a PSA
increase >2 ng/mL. Metastatic disease was documented in
1 patient.
In the LR group, we observed a 5-year DFS rate of
97.3% (Fig. 2 C), which proved superior to the 93% his-
torical control rate we chose for comparison (lower limit of
95% confidence interval, 94.6%). In the IR group, the
5-year DFS rate was 97.1% (Fig. 2 D). The 5-year DFS
rates for the MSK favorable and unfavorable IR subgroups
were 100% and 93.1%, respectively.
Discussion
This study demonstrates that dose-escalated prostate SBRT
can be safely administered across numerous institutions. At
a dose level of 40 Gy in 5 fractions and with 5 years of
follow-up, rates of grade 3 to 5 toxicities were far below the
10% rate deemed excessive.
The toxicity of prostate SBRT relative to EBRT has been
the subject of debate (28). Although our study was not
designed to compare toxicity rates, contrasting these out-
comes against others may generate hypotheses. Table 3
shows that late grade 2 to 5 toxicities in our study are
similar to those from centers delivering 35 to 36.25 Gy of
SBRT

 therapies. By contrast, a retrospective analysis of the
Medicare database found more GU-related claims (a sur-
rogate for GU toxicity) after SBRT than after intensity
modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) (29). This study did
not indicate dose (high levels being associated with
excessive toxicity) (15) or other details of the SBRT tech-
nique. The current trial used modest dose escalation; real-
time image guidance with automatic translation and
rotational correction; non-coplanar, submillimeter radiation
therapy delivery; and rigid constraint of dose to normal
tissues. The rigorous control of these factors may account
for favorable toxicity rates observed in our study. Because
SBRT can be technically challenging, new adopters should
carefully follow published treatment guidelines.
The effective biological dose (equivalent to 100 Gy at 2
Gy/fraction, assuming a/b Z 2 Gy) delivered in this trial
represents a considerable escalation over typical IMRT
doses. In the LR subgroup, the DFS rate of 97.3% was
superior to a comparison rate of 93% observed with dose-
escalated EBRT. Similar favorable DFS rates have been
reported in LR patients treated with comparable dose
escalation using low-dose-rate brachytherapy (30). For IR
patients, the 5-year DFS rate of 97.1% we observed com-
pares favorably with the 84% to 90% 5-year DFS rates
reported with IMRT (31, 32). One may speculate that dose
escalation is responsible for improving DFS rates. Another
hypothesis is that very large dose-per-fraction radiation
therapy enhances antitumor immunity (33).
Adding ADT to dose-escalated EBRT is recommended
in unfavorable IR patients (34); nonrandomized series have
shown that ADT improves the 5-year relapse-free survival
rate to approximately 93% (35). We observed a 93% DFS
rate in the MSK unfavorable subgroup using SBRT alone,
suggesting these SBRT doses may obviate adjuvant ADT.
More research is necessary to determine whether dose
escalation allows unfavorable IR patients to avoid the well-
documented toxicity of ADT.
This study has several limitations. Because late toxicities
may develop beyond 5 years, these toxicity rates may un-
derestimate actual long-term rates. For example, in RTOG

Stereotactic body radiation therapy for prostate cancer
301
 outcomes were compared against historical controls, biases
inherent in nonrandomized studies may confound these re-
sults. Multicenter clinical trials are randomizing patients
between EBRT and 5- to 7-fraction radiation therapy
(36, 37); a preliminary toxicity report appears favorable (38),
and we await long-term efficacy outcomes.
Conclusions
This study demonstrated that dose-escalated prostate SBRT
is safe, with grade 3 toxicities occurring in only 1.3% of
patients. DFS rates compared favorably with those in
EBRT. With appropriate treatment planning and delivery,
SBRT is a suitable option for patients with LR and IR
prostate cancer.
