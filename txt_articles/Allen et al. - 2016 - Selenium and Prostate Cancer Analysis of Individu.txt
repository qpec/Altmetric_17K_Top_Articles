Abstract
Background: Some observational studies suggest that a higher selenium status is associated with a lower risk of prostate
cancer but have been generally too small to provide precise estimates of associations, particularly by disease stage and grade.

 Methods: Collaborating investigators from 15 prospective studies provided individual-participant records (from predomi-
nantly men of white European ancestry) on blood or toenail selenium concentrations and prostate cancer risk. Odds ratios of
prostate cancer by selenium concentration were estimated using multivariable-adjusted conditional logistic regression. All
statistical tests were two-sided.
Results: Blood selenium was not associated with the risk of total prostate cancer (multivariable-adjusted odds ratio [OR] per
80 percentile increase ¼ 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] ¼ 0.83 to 1.23, based on 4527 case patients and 6021 control
subjects). However, there was heterogeneity by disease aggressiveness (ie, advanced stage and/or prostate cancer death,
Pheterogeneity ¼ .01), with high blood selenium associated with a lower risk of aggressive disease (OR ¼ 0.43, 95% CI ¼ 0.21 to
0.87) but not with nonaggressive disease. Nail selenium was inversely associated with total prostate cancer (OR ¼ 0.29, 95%
CI ¼ 0.22 to 0.40, Ptrend < .001, based on 1970 case patients and 2086 control subjects), including both nonaggressive (OR ¼ 0.33,
95% CI ¼ 0.22 to 0.50) and aggressive disease (OR ¼ 0.18, 95% CI ¼ 0.11 to 0.31, Pheterogeneity ¼ .08).
Conclusions: Nail, but not blood, selenium concentration is inversely associated with risk of total prostate cancer, possibly
because nails are a more reliable marker of long-term selenium exposure. Both blood and nail selenium concentrations are
associated with a reduced risk of aggressive disease, which warrants further investigation.
There has been great interest in the possible role of selenium in
cancer prevention, largely because of its antioxidant properties,
although it also has other potentially anticarcinogenic effects
(1). The efficacy of selenium as a cancer prevention agent has
been tested in several randomized controlled trials although re-
sults have been inconsistent, perhaps because of the relatively
small number of cases (particularly of aggressive disease) iden-
tified during follow-up and different levels of baseline selenium
in the populations under study (2–6). Results from observational
studies are also conflicting (7–20); some have reported high
blood or nail selenium to be associated with a lower risk of total
prostate cancer (8,9) or aggressive disease (10–12) while others
have found no statistically significant association (13–20).
The Endogenous Hormones, Nutritional Biomarkers and
Prostate Cancer Collaborative Group (EHNBPCCG) was estab-
lished to conduct collaborative analyses of individual partici-
pant data from prospective studies on the associations of
circulating concentrations of hormones and nutritional bio-
markers with the subsequent risk of prostate cancer (21–26).
The objective of the present study is to determine the associa-
tion between blood and nail selenium concentration and risk of
prostate cancer in 15 prospective studies and to evaluate this
association
by
stage
and
grade
of
disease
and
other
characteristics.
Methods
Identification of Studies and Collection of Data
A detailed description of the EHNBPCCG is reported elsewhere
(21). In 2010, collaborators were invited to contribute data on
prediagnostic measures of nutritional biomarkers and prostate
cancer risk. Studies were identified from review articles, litera-
ture searches using PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library,
and CancerLit (up to January 2013), and from discussions with
colleagues in order to identify unpublished data.
Seventeen eligible studies were identified, of which 15 are
included in the current analysis, comprising 6497 men with
prostate cancer (case patients) and 8107 men without prostate
cancer (control subjects) (2, 4, 8, 10–19), including unpublished
data from the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT), provided

from

´mentation
en VItamines et Mine
´raux Anti-oXydants (SU.VI.MAX) Trial by
Pilar Galan, Me
´lanie Deschasaux, and Mathilde Touvier, from
Inserm (University of Paris, Paris, France), of which study details
are reported elsewhere (27,28). Data were not available for the
Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men (ULSAM) (20) or the
Honolulu Heart Program (9).
Information on recruitment, informed consent, ethical ap-
proval, and inclusion criteria for all studies is available in the
original publications. Eight studies used a nested case-control
study design in populations with no organized screening pro-
gram but with varying levels of population-wide prostate-specific
antigen (PSA) testing (8,11,14–19); seven studies were observa-
tional investigations based within randomized controlled trials
(2,4,10,13,16,27,28) (Supplementary Table 1, available online).
Individual participant data were requested for selenium con-
centrations measured in blood or nails (see Supplementary
Table 2, available online, for details of the assay methods), date
and age at sample collection, fasting status, marital status, eth-
nicity, educational attainment, family history of prostate can-
cer, height, weight, waist and hip circumference, smoking
status, and alcohol intake. Most studies included men of white
European ancestry; those studies that did include men of differ-
ent ethnic backgrounds included this as a matching criterion
(4,14,18).
Each study provided data on prostate cancer stage and grade,
if available. Tumor stage was categorized as localized if it was
TNM staging tumor (T)–node (N)-metastasis (M) categories of T2
or lower with no reported lymph node involvement or metasta-
ses, stage II or lower or equivalent; advanced if it was T3 or T4
and/or N1þ and/or M1, stage III or IV or equivalent; or stage un-
known. Aggressive disease was defined as T4 and/or N1þ and/or
M1, or stage IV disease and/or death from prostate cancer; nonag-
gressive disease was defined as TNM stage lower than T4 with no
reported lymph node involvement or metastases or the equiva-
lent, or unknown. Histological grade was categorized as low-
intermediate grade (Gleason sum < 8, or coded as well, moder-
ately, or poorly differentiated), high-grade (Gleason sum 8þ, or
coded as undifferentiated), or unknown. Our definition of high-
grade disease used in this and other analyses (23–26) is more
stringent than our previous collaborative analyses (which used
Gleason score of 7 or above) (21,22); while this will lead to identifi-
cation of relatively small numbers of high-grade tumours, it re-
duces the risk of misclassification of high-grade disease.

 distribution. All analyses were run separately for blood and nail
selenium. Analysis of covariance was used to investigate geo-
metric mean differences in selenium concentration among the
controls by baseline characteristics, with adjustment for study
and age at blood collection. Tests for trend across the categories
were obtained by scoring the categories 1, 2, 3, etc., as required.
Men were categorized into fifths of selenium concentration
with quintile cutpoints defined by the overall distribution
among control participants in all studies combined. This ap-
proach maximizes the ability to examine associations across
the full selenium distribution across all studies and assumes
that the differences in absolute values between studies are be-
cause of true population differences rather than assay differ-
ences between the studies (29). Analyses were also performed
with cutpoints defined by the study-specific quintiles of sele-
nium concentration.
To provide a summary measure of risk, a linear trend was cal-
culated by replacing the categorical variable representing the
fifths of selenium with a continuous variable that was scored as
0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1. As the midpoints of the lowest and highest
fifths are the 10th and 90th percentiles of the study-specific sele-
nium concentration, a unit change in this continuous trend vari-
able (which represents an 80th percentile increase) is comparable
with the relative risk comparing the highest with the lowest fifth.
Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ra-
tios (ORs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals
(CIs), conditioned on the matching variables within each study
and with additional adjustment for age at blood collection (ex-
act), body mass index (BMI ¼ <25, 25–27.4, 27.5–29.9, �30 kg/m2,
not known), height (�170, 171–175, 176–180, >180 cm, not
known), marital status (married/cohabiting, not married/co-
habiting, not known), educational status (did not graduate from
high school/secondary school/college, high school/secondary
school/college graduates, university graduates, not known), and
cigarette smoking (never, past, current, not known). These fac-
tors were found to be associated with prostate cancer risk in
this dataset and hence were included in the final models.
Heterogeneity in linear trends between studies was tested
by comparing the v2 values for models with and without a
(study) x (linear trend) interaction term. Tests for heterogeneity
of trends for the case-defined factors were obtained by fitting
separate models for each subgroup and assuming indepen-
dence of the odds ratios using a method analogous to a meta-
analysis. Tests for heterogeneity for the non-case-defined
factors were assessed with a v2-test of interaction between sub-
group and the continuous trend test variable. Further analyses
of the association of selenium with disease stage, aggressive-
ness, and grade were conducted by calculating odds ratios in
fifths of the distribution.
All P values reported are two-tailed, and a P value of less
than .05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical
analyses were carried out using Stata (StataCorp LP, 2011, Stata
Statistical Software: Release 13, College Station, TX).
Results
Details of the 15 participating studies are shown in Table 1.
Data were available for 4527 case patients and 6021 control sub-
jects for blood selenium and for 1970 cases and 2086 controls for
nail selenium. In European populations, median values in con-
trols were below 1130 nmol/L and 0.55 ppm for blood and nail
samples, respectively; studies in the United States had median
values higher than 1370 nmol/L and higher than 0.78 ppm,
respectively (Table 1). The duration of follow-up varied substan-
tially; in some studies (Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging
[BLSA], beta-Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial [CARET], Multi-
Ethnic Cohort [MEC], Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian
Cancer Screening trial [PLCO], and Selenium and Vitamin E
Cancer Prevention Trial [SELECT]), more than 70% of men were
diagnosed less than five years following recruitment; in others
(European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-
Heidelberg [EPIC-Heidelberg], Netherlands Cohort Study [NLCS],
PCPT, Physicians’ Health Study [PHS] and SU.VI.MAX), more
than 70% of case patients were diagnosed five or more years af-
ter recruitment (Table 2). Age at diagnosis varied less widely, al-
though the SU.VI.MAX trial included a higher proportion of men
diagnosed at an early age (34% of case patients were diagnosed
at younger than age 60 years) compared with the other studies.
The time period of diagnosis varied substantially between stud-
ies owing to the different time periods of recruitment and the
duration of follow-up. The proportion of case patients with ad-
vanced disease varied from 1.6% (PCPT) to 72% (NLCS). The pro-
portion of case patients with high-grade disease varied from
0.2% (MEC) to 16% (HPFS) (Table 2; see Supplementary Table 3,
available online, for details of the number of cases by stage,
grade, and other tumor characteristics by study).
The cross-sectional associations between baseline charac-
teristics and blood and nail selenium concentrations are shown
in Supplementary Figure 1 (available online). Blood selenium
concentrations were slightly lower in men who were older, who
had a higher BMI, and who were current smokers and were
slightly higher in men who had fasted for longer at the time of
blood collection. Nail selenium concentrations were lower in
current smokers and slightly higher in men who were married
and highly educated.
The associations of blood and nail selenium concentrations
with prostate cancer risk are shown in Figure 1A. After adjust-
ment for BMI, height, age, marital status, education, and smok-
ing status, the odds ratio per 80th percentile increase of blood
selenium concentration was 1.01 (95% CI ¼ 0.83 to 1.23, Ptrend ¼
.92), based on 4527 case patients and 6021 control subjects; for
nail selenium, the corresponding odds ratio was 0.29 (95%
CI ¼ 0.22 to 0.40, Ptrend < .001), based on 1970 case patients and
2086 control subjects. Adjustment for the potential confounders
listed above made little difference to the risk estimates (unad-
justed OR per 80 percentile increase was 1.02, 95% CI ¼ 0.85 to
1.24, Ptrend ¼ 0.81 for blood selenium; OR ¼ 0.36, 95% CI ¼ 0.27 to
0.48, Ptrend < .001 for nail selenium). Associations were qualita-
tively similar when the analysis was performed using study-
specific cutpoints although the risk estimate was attenuated for
nail measures, reflecting the narrower ranges of selenium con-
centration when using these cutpoints (Figure 1B).
In order to examine the association at the extremes of the
distribution, selenium concentration was categorized into dec-
iles and analyzed using overall cutpoints for all studies com-
bined. There remained no association with blood selenium
(multivariable-adjusted OR for the highest [midpoint ¼ 2092
nmol/L] vs lowest tenth [midpoint ¼ 792 nmol/L] ¼ 0.94, 95%
CI ¼ 0.71 to 1.23, Ptrend ¼ .69) and a strong inverse association
with nail selenium (OR for the highest [midpoint ¼ 1.08 ppm] vs
lowest tenth (midpoint ¼ 0.17 ppm) ¼ 0.25, 95% CI ¼ 0.17 to 0.37,
Ptrend < .001).
There was no evidence of heterogeneity between the con-
tributing studies in the linear association of blood selenium
concentration with risk (Pheterogeneity ¼ .59) (Figure 2A). There
was also no evidence of heterogeneity in the association of nail
selenium
concentration

†Stage of disease was defined as: localized if TNM was T2 or lower with no reported lymph node involvement or metastases, stage II or lower, or equivalent (ie, a tumor that
does not extend beyond the prostate capsule); advanced if TNM stage was T3 or T4 and/or N1þ and/or M1, stage III or IV, equivalent (ie, a tumor extending beyond the pros-
tate capsule and/or lymph node involvement and/or distant metastases), or unknown. Overall, 5315 (82%) of case patients had data on stage. Aggressive disease was defined
as T4 and/or N1þ and/or M1þ, or stage IV disease and/or death from prostate cancer. Overall, 5432 (84%) of case patients had data on disease aggressiveness.
‡Histological grade was categorized as low-intermediate grade (Gleason sum <8 or cases coded as well, moderately, or poorly differentiated), high-grade (Gleason sum
8þ or cases coded as undifferentiated), or unknown. Overall, 5900 (91%) of case patients had information on grade.

 (Pheterogeneity ¼ .09) (Figure 2B), and the inverse association with
prostate cancer persisted after exclusion of the largest dataset
(NLCS) although it was attenuated (OR per 80th percentile in-
crease ¼ 0.69, 95% CI ¼ 0.50 to 0.94, Ptrend ¼ .02).
There was evidence of heterogeneity in the linear associa-
tion of blood selenium concentration with prostate cancer risk
according to disease aggressiveness (Pheterogeneity ¼ .01), with a
higher blood selenium concentration associated with a lower
risk of aggressive disease (OR per 80th percentile increase ¼
0.43, 95% CI ¼ 0.21 to 0.87), with no association with nonaggres-
sive disease (OR ¼ 1.12, 95% CI ¼ 0.89 to 1.41) (Figure 3A). The dif-
ferences in associations of blood selenium with risk by stage
and grade of disease were not statistically significant although
a reduced risk with high blood selenium was also seen for men
diagnosed with advanced-stage or high-grade disease. Analyses
of the relationship between overall fifths of blood selenium con-
centration and risk of prostate cancer by disease stage, aggres-
siveness, and grade are shown in Supplementary Figure 2
(available online). These findings support the linear trend esti-
mates although the numbers are small in some categories.
There were no statistically significant differences in the associ-
ation between nail selenium concentration and prostate cancer
risk by stage or grade of disease, although nail selenium was as-
sociated with a particularly low risk for aggressive disease (OR
per 80th percentile increase ¼ 0.18, 95% CI ¼ 0.11 to 0.31) com-
pared with nonaggressive disease (OR ¼ 0.33, 95% CI ¼ 0.22 to 0.
50, Pheterogeneity ¼ .08) (Figure 3B).
Of the eight other factors examined, there was also evidence
of heterogeneity in the linear association of both blood and nail
selenium concentration with prostate cancer risk by smoking
status (Pheterogeneity ¼ .02 and .01, respectively) and for nail sele-
nium by family history (Pheterogeneity ¼ .04) (Figure 3).
Discussion
This international collaboration has brought together and re-
analyzed almost all of the available data on the association of
blood and nail selenium concentrations and prostate cancer in-
cidence. The majority of the data were from studies with blood
Figure 1. Odds ratios (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) of prostate cancer associated with fifths of blood and nail selenium concentration, adjusted for age at blood collec-
tion, body mass index, height, marital status, education, and smoking. The Ptrend was calculated by replacing the fifths of selenium with a continuous variable that was
scored as 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 in the conditional logistic regression model. Median concentrations in each fifth (using overall cutpoints) are: 874, 1184, 1467, 1677, and
1939 nmol/L for blood selenium and 0.46, 0.54, 0.63, 0.77, and 0.96 ppm for nail selenium. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results in the figures are presented as
squares and lines, representing the odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals, respectively. The position of the square indicates the value of the odds ra-
tio while the size of the square is inversely proportional to the variance of the logarithm of the odds ratio and indicates the amount of statistical information available
for that particular estimate. The open diamonds (the lateral points of which are the 95% CIs) represent the overall odds ratio for an 80th percentile increase in selenium
concentration. 80%le ¼ 80 percentile; CI ¼ confidence interval; OR ¼ odds ratio; Ptr ¼ Ptrend.

 measures, which showed no association with risk of total pros-
tate cancer (based on 4527 case patients and 6021 control sub-
jects) but an approximate halving in risk for aggressive disease
in men with high blood concentrations (based on 527 case
patients and 634 control subjects). Combining (using a weighted
average) our collaborative risk estimate with those from the two
blood-based studies that were unable to contribute data (9,20)
produced similar findings (OR for high vs low category of sele-
nium concentration ¼ 0.92, 95% CI ¼ 0.82 to 1.04).
Four studies provided data on nail measures, which showed a
70% reduction in risk for total prostate cancer (based on 1970 case
patients and 2086 control subjects), with no statistically significant
difference by disease subgroups, although the association was
somewhat stronger for aggressive compared with nonaggressive
disease. The majority of the data are from a single study (NLCS),
which also had substantially lower selenium concentrations than
the other studies and a high proportion of advanced and aggres-
sive disease, owing to an enriched sampling of such cases.
Our overall finding of a null association of total prostate can-
cer risk with blood selenium levels is consistent with findings
from the SELECT trial, which randomly assigned men to selenium
supplementation (200 mg/day L-selenomethionine) with or with-
out vitamin E (400 IU/d of all rac-a-tocopheryl acetate) for 5.5 years,
based on 848 cases (3). Two smaller randomized trials of selenium
supplementation among men at a high risk of developing pros-
tate cancer (the SWOG S9917 and the Negative Biopsy Trial) also
showed no association with prostate cancer risk after three to five
years follow-up although these findings were based on small
numbers of cases (97 and 74, respectively) (5,6). It has been argued
that the lack of a protective effect may have been because of the
relatively high baseline serum selenium concentration in these
men (with a median of 1715 nmol/L in the SELECT trial). This is
because the NPC trial, designed to assess the efficacy of selenium
supplementation for the prevention of nonmelanoma skin can-
cer, found that selenium supplementation (as 200 mg/d selenium
in the form of selenized yeast) for an average of 4.5 years was as-
sociated with a statistically significant 52% reduction in prostate
cancer risk 13 years later (based on 63 cases), which was particu-
larly evident among men with a low baseline serum concentra-
tion (ie, <1290 nmol/L at entry to the trial) (2).
The apparent difference in risk observed for total prostate can-
cer between the blood and nail measures may partly be because
of the differences in case-mix across the studies. Compared with
studies with blood measures, those with nail measures contained
a higher proportion of advanced-stage (55% vs 14%) and aggres-
sive disease (38% vs 15%) and more men whose samples were
taken before 1995 (48% vs 18%). Widespread use of PSA testing
was introduced in many countries from the mid-1990s onwards
(although use has varied between populations) while PSA screen-
ing was used systematically in two of the collaborating studies
(PCPT and PLCO), contributing to an increase in the detection of
small, asymptomatic tumors in recent years (30).
Because a substantial proportion of PSA-detected cancers re-
main biologically indolent for many years (31), the identification
of factors that are associated with the development of clinically
aggressive cancers is important. Hence, our finding that both
blood and nail concentrations were associated with a lower risk
of aggressive prostate cancer is of potential etiological relevance.
However, there are some data to suggest that, among men diag-
nosed with nonmetastatic disease, high doses of selenium

selenium concentration in selected subgroups, adjusted for age at blood collection, body mass index, height, marital status, education, and smoking. Tests for hetero-
geneity for the case-defined factors were obtained by fitting separate models for each subgroup and assuming independence of the odds ratios using a method analo-
gous to a meta-analysis. Tests for heterogeneity for the non-case-defined factors were assessed with a v2-test of interaction between subgroup and the continuous
trend test variable. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results in the figures are presented as squares and lines, representing the odds ratios and corresponding 95%
confidence intervals, respectively. The position of the square indicates the value of the odds ratio while the size of the square is inversely proportional to the variance
of the logarithm of the odds ratio and indicates the amount of statistical information available for that particular estimate. The open diamonds (the lateral points of
which are the 95% CIs) represent the overall odds ratio for an 80th percentile increase in selenium concentration. CI ¼ confidence interval; het ¼ heterogeneity; OR ¼

 supplementation (140 mg/day or more) might be associated with
an increased risk of prostate cancer death (32). Moreover, the
SELECT trial also found that selenium supplementation was asso-
ciated with an increased risk of high-grade (Gleason score �7)
prostate cancer among men with high baseline selenium levels
but not among men with lower baseline nail levels (4). However,
the results of trials of the effect of selenium supplementation on
PSA velocity (used as a marker of disease progression) have been
inconsistent (6,33). Overall, owing to the low numbers of aggres-
sive cancers diagnosed in many populations (in the current anal-
yses, SELECT and NPC contributed 3 and 7 cases of aggressive
disease, respectively), trials of selenium supplementation for the
primary prevention of prostate cancer would have to be very large
to assess differences by tumor stage and grade and are unlikely to
be funded. Rather, further prospective studies in populations
with a relatively high incidence of aggressive disease are war-
ranted to investigate the association of long-term selenium con-
centration with disease incidence and progression.
Although it is possible that the inverse association found with
blood and nail selenium concentration and risk of aggressive
prostate cancer might be because of confounding, the analyses
were adjusted for a range of lifestyle factors in addition to the
matching factors used in the individual studies, none of which
materially influenced the risk estimates. There was also no statis-
tically significant heterogeneity in the association of blood or nail
selenium concentration with risk of prostate cancer according to
the number of years between blood collection and diagnosis,
which does not suggest that reverse causation has affected the
results, although this cannot be excluded. Finally, while there
was some evidence of statistical heterogeneity in the association
of selenium with risk by smoking status, the pattern of the associ-
ation differed between blood and nail measures and the statisti-
cally significant heterogeneity may have been because of chance
because of the large number of statistical tests performed.
Relatively little is known about the performance of blood and
nail specimens as measures of long-term selenium status. Studies
have shown that both blood and nail measures are correlated with
selenium intake (r¼ 0.6 to 0.7) (34, 35) and with each other (r¼ 0.6)
(36). Nail clippings provide a measure of exposure over several
weeks up to six to 12 months before sample collection (37), with
good repeatability over several years (r ¼ 0.5 to 0.7) (38–40). Blood
levels represent shorter-term selenium exposure (1–2 weeks) (37),
although we have not identified data on the reproducibility of cir-
culating concentrations to determine its stability over the long
term. Thus, the differences in the findings for total prostate cancer
between blood and nail measures may suggest that longer-term
measures of selenium exposure are more relevant. Nonetheless, it
remains difficult to determine the extent to which circulating or
nail concentrations accurately reflect biological activity within
prostatic tissue (41), especially at higher levels of selenium intake,
when glutathione peroxidase activity is saturated (42). Genetic
studies may help to clarify the role of individual selenoproteins in
prostate carcinogenesis (19,43–48) although more work is needed
to elucidate the relationship of variants in genes that help to regu-
late selenium status with levels of functional biomarkers of sele-
nium and the influence of such variants as modifiers on the
relationship between selenium and prostate cancer risk.
This collaborative re-analysis of the association of selenium
status and prostate cancer risk based on the totality of the
worldwide data shows that relatively high blood and nail sele-
nium concentrations are associated with a reduced risk of ag-
gressive
prostate
cancer.
Further
investigation
in
large,
representative populations that have selenium measurements
from both blood and nail samples and that include information
on screening history, as well as stage and grade of tumors, is
needed to examine these possible associations in more detail.
