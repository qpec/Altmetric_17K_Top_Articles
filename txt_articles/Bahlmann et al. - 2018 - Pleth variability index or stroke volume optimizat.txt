Abstract
Background: The impact of Goal Directed Fluid Therapy (GDFT) based on the non-invasive Pleth Variability Index
(PVI) on clinical outcome after abdominal surgery has only sparingly been explored. The purpose of this study was
to compare the effect of intraoperative GDFT guided by PVI to a control group using esophageal Doppler on the
incidence of complications and length of hospital stay after major abdominal surgery. We hypothesized that there
would be no difference between the groups.
Methods: This was a randomized controlled trial in a Swedish university hospital between November 2011 and
January 2015; 150 patients scheduled for open abdominal surgery lasting 2 h or more were included. Exclusion
criteria included hepatic resection or severe cardiac arrhythmia. The patients were randomized 1:1 to either the
intervention group or the control group. The intervention group received intraoperative GDFT by administering
fluid boluses of 3 ml/kg tetrastarch aiming at a PVI value below 10%, while GDFT in the control group aimed for
optimization of stroke volume as assessed with esophageal Doppler. Blinded observers assessed complications until
postoperative day 30 using pre-defined definitions, as well as length of hospital stay.
Results: One hundred and-fifty patients were randomized and 146 patients were available for the final data analysis.
Median duration of surgery was 3 h. A total of 64 complications occurred in the PVI group (N = 74) and 70 in the
Doppler group (N = 72) (p = 0.93). Median (IQR) length of stay was 8.0 (8.0) days in the PVI group and 8.0 (9.5) in the
Doppler group (P = 0.57).
Conclusions: No difference in clinical outcome, as defined by number of postoperative complications, and length of
hospital stay, was found when goal directed fluid therapy was applied using PVI as an alternative to esophageal
Doppler. PVI appears to be an acceptable alternative to esophageal Doppler for goal directed fluid therapy during
major open abdominal surgery.

 Background
The incidence of postoperative complications after major
abdominal surgery is increased by both overly restricted and
overly liberal fluid administration [1]. Goal directed fluid
therapy (GDFT) aims to determine the optimal amount of
fluid for an individual patient, and meta-analyses point out
its clinical benefits, especially in patients not participating in
an enhanced recovery program [2, 3]. Hemodynamic
optimization has mostly been guided by stroke volume,
commonly measured via esophageal Doppler, or by dynamic
parameters such as stroke volume variation, pulse pressure
variation or the pulse oximetric Pleth Variability Index
(PVI), which all are based on cardiopulmonary interactions.
The latter techniques have been advocated because they
are easier to apply and of similar clinical value as methods
aiming at optimization of stroke volume [3] despite cer-
tain methodological issues, such as the influence of tidal
volume, respiratory and heart rate ratio, spontaneous
breathing, chest wall compliance, arrhythmia and abdom-
inal pressure [4, 5]. The impact of PVI on clinical outcome
in terms of postoperative complications or length of stay
is sparingly described in randomized studies [6–8]. PVI
guided bolus doses were compared either to a fluid
regimen using bolus doses based on mean blood pressure
[6, 7] or on Doppler measured stroke volume changes [8].
Although no difference on the incidence of postoperative
complications or length of stay was reported, the studies
are small and two of them restricted to colonic surgery.
We found it of interest to further evaluate the effect of
PVI on clinical outcome in abdominal surgery.
We designed a randomized controlled trial comparing
patients treated with fluid optimization guided by PVI
with
control
patients
who
received
stroke
volume
optimization guided by esophageal Doppler.
This is a planned secondary analysis of a study primar-
ily designed to analyze differences in intraoperative fluid
use. Primary outcome measures were the amount of
colloid used for optimization of fluid status and the
concordance between different methods for assessing
preoperative dehydration. These results have been pub-
lished elsewhere [9, 10] and included the first half of the
study cohort (75 patients). The present article focuses
on clinical outcome in the whole cohort of 150 patients,
as quantified by number of postoperative complications
up to 30 days after surgery and length of hospital stay,
both of which were designated as secondary outcome
measures in the study protocol.
We hypothesized that there would be no difference be-
tween the groups regarding these parameters.
Methods
Ethical approval was obtained from the Regional Eth-
ical Review Board in Linköping in March 2011 (2011/
101–31), as was written informed consent from all
included patients. The study was prospectively regis-
tered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 01458678).
This single-blind randomized study was performed at
University Hospital Linköping, a 600-bed tertiary care
facility in Sweden. As previously described [9], adult pa-
tients, ASA class 1–3, planned for elective open abdom-
inal surgery with an expected duration of at least 2 h
were screened for inclusion. Exclusion criteria included
hepatic resection, severe forms of cardiac arrhythmia,
planned central hemodynamic monitoring for cardiac
reasons, enrollment in another interventional study or
unavailability of research staff.
General management
Patients
were
recruited
from
different
departments
(gynecology, surgery and urology) and therefore pre-
operative management with regard to fluids and antibi-
otics
followed
departmental
routines,
which
could
include an explicit enhanced recovery program. After
siting a thoracic epidural catheter (when indicated), gen-
eral anesthesia was induced using fentanyl and propofol
or thiopental and maintained using sevoflurane and iter-
ated doses of fentanyl. Intubation was facilitated with
rocuronium or succinylcholine. Epidural analgesia was
started before the surgery commenced using a continu-
ous infusion of a mixture of bupivacaine, fentanyl and
epinephrine supplemented by bolus doses if indicated.
All patients were ventilated using a Volume Control
mode with a standardized tidal volume of 7 ml kg− 1
ideal body weight [11].
A maximum of 500 ml of tetrastarch, either Venofundin (B
Braun Medical AB, Danderyd, Sweden) or Volulyte (Fresenius
Kabi AB, Uppsala, Sweden), could be infused during the epi-
dural catheter placement and the subsequent induction of
anesthesia. Both groups received a baseline infusion of
2 ml kg− 1 h− 1 (actual body weight) of a 2.5% buffered dex-
trose solution containing 70 mmol l− 1 sodium, 45 mmol l− 1
chloride, and 25 mmol l− 1 acetate (Glukos Braun 25 mg ml−
1 with buffer (B Braun Medical AB, Danderyd, Sweden) dur-
ing surgery. Correction for additional crystalloid fluids given
(e.g. antibiotics) was not made. Up to 1000 ml of Ringer’s
acetate could be infused during surgery to compensate for
preoperative dehydration or increased non-hemorrhagic in-
traoperative fluid loss. Bleeding was replaced 1:1 with a col-
loid (tetrastarch, albumin 5%, plasma, packed red blood cells
or platelets). Infusions with vasoconstrictors (norepinephrine
or phenylephrine) and/or inotropes (dobutamine) were used
at the discretion of the responsible anesthetist.
Study groups
Patients were recruited and randomized 1:1 by HB or
LN, using opaque envelopes prepared by a research
nurse from a computerized randomization procedure
[12], to receive intraoperative fluid optimization guided

 by either the pulse oximetric PVI or esophageal Doppler. The
PVI was monitored using a Radical-7 Pulse CO-oximeter
(Masimo Corporation, Irvine, California, USA) with PVI soft-
ware (Version SET V7.8.0.1), a re-usable sensor (R2-25r) and
a disposable adhesive (R2-25a). The sensor was placed on the
middle or index finger of either hand and was covered to
avoid room light interference. The placement of a blood pres-
sure cuff on the same arm was avoided.
The esophageal Doppler measurements were performed
using a CardioQ apparatus (Deltex Medical, Chicester,
United Kingdom) equipped with a DP12 probe, and the
signal was averaged over 20 cardiac cycles. In both groups,
fluid optimization was initiated after induction of general
anesthesia and undertaken by infusing 3 ml kg− 1 actual
body weight (up to 250 ml) of tetrastarch intravenously
during 3–5 min, using a 50 ml syringe. As described previ-
ously [9], during the first half of the study (patients 1–75),
in which the concordance between the methods was stud-
ied, all patients were monitored with both PVI and
esophageal Doppler. Only the allocated monitor was vis-
ible to the responsible anesthetist. For the second part (pa-
tients 76–150) only the allocated monitor was used.
Fluid bolus algorithms
In the PVI group, a fluid bolus was given if PVI ≥ 10%.
The cut-off value of 10% was chosen based on a previous
report [13]. If the PVI 5 min after the fluid bolus fell below
10%, no more fluid was given. If the PVI 5 min after the
fluid bolus was still ≥10% but had decreased, a repeat fluid
bolus was given. Fluid boluses were repeated until the PVI
fell below 10% or did not decrease at all. During surgery,
additional optimizations were undertaken in the same way
whenever the PVI increased to ≥10%. In order to have at
least one fluid bolus available in each patient for analyzing
the performance of PVI compared to Doppler during an
optimization and in analogy with the Doppler group [9], a
fluid bolus was given to all patients in the PVI group after
induction of anesthesia, irrespective of the PVI value.
In the Doppler group, volume optimization was guided
by the stroke volume changes in accordance with pub-
lished protocols [14, 15]. Following an initial Doppler
measurement, a fluid bolus was given and a new Dop-
pler measurement was performed 5 min later. Fluid bo-
luses were repeated until the stroke volume no longer
increased by 10%. The 10% cut-off value is commonly
used in studies involving the esophageal Doppler, and is
based on measurement characteristics of the device [16].
During surgery, additional optimizations were under-
taken in the same way whenever the stroke volume had
decreased by ≥10%.
Clinical outcome
Two blinded observers retrospectively documented compli-
cations during the first 30 days after surgery using a
pre-specified list of complications adapted from Brandstrup
et al. [17] (see Additional file 1). A telephone call from the
research nurse after postoperative day 30 supplemented the
information from the electronic patient chart. If patients re-
ceived care at another hospital during the 30 day period,
copies of relevant reports were requested. Each observer in-
dependently scored complications; differences were resolved
by discussion.
Length of hospital stay was defined as the number of
calendar days spent in hospital, from the day of primary
surgery until the 30th postoperative day. In case of
in-hospital death within the observation period, a length
of stay of 31 days was assumed.
Statistical analysis
In order to calculate a sample size that would be suffi-
cient also for the secondary endpoint postoperative com-
plications, we used combined data from the intervention
arms of five previous studies on GDFT during abdom-
inal surgery [18–22]. An expected total of 55 complica-
tions per 100 patients with a standard deviation of 19
was calculated. With a power of 90% and a significance
level of 5%, 66 patients would need to be included in
each group to be able to demonstrate an absolute differ-
ence of 10% in postoperative complications [23]. Allow-
ing for dropouts it was decided to include 150 patients
in the study. Analysis was done on an intention to treat
basis. Between groups differences were analyzed using
Student T-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, Fisher’s Exact test
and chi-square test as appropriate using Statistica, ver-
sions 12 and 13 (Dell Incorporated, Tulsa, Oklahoma,
USA). A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
Patients were recruited between November 14, 2011 and
December 8, 2014, and the follow up of the last patient
ended on January 8, 2015. A CONSORT flow diagram is
presented in Fig. 1. After exclusion of four patients 146
were available for analysis.
Patient and surgical characteristics are presented in
Table 1. Median duration of surgery was 3 h in both
groups, with some procedures lasting more than 12 h.
Types of surgery are specified in Additional file 2.
In two patients in the PVI group (one with increasing
lactic acidosis and one with continuing hemodynamic
instability), in which the PVI indicated no need for fur-
ther fluids, Doppler data were requested by the respon-
sible anesthetist. These data confirmed an adequate fluid
status, and the Doppler data were blinded for the rest of
the procedure. These patients remained in the PVI
group for the intention to treat analysis.
There were no differences between the groups in the
amounts of colloids used during the optimizations, or in
any other intraoperative fluid parameters (Table 2), with

 the exception of phenylephrine slightly more often being
used in the PVI group (P = 0.04). Mean increase in body
weight 1 day after surgery was 1.3 kg (SD 2.4) in the PVI
group and 1.3 kg (SD 1.7) in the Doppler group (P = 0.97).
Postoperative complications and length of hospital stay
There was no mortality during the study period. There
were in total 64 complications in the PVI group (n = 74)
and 70 in the Doppler group (n = 72) (P = 0.93), corre-
sponding to 38 (51%) patients in the PVI group and 35
(49%) patients in the Doppler group (P = 0.74) having
had at least one complication (Table 3). Eleven compli-
cations necessitated surgical intervention requiring gen-
eral anesthesia (three in the PVI group and eight in the
Doppler group (P = 0.55)) and in each group two com-
plications required admission to the intensive care unit.
Median length of hospital stay was 8.0 days (IQR 8.0) in
the PVI group and 8.0 days (IQR 9.5) in the Doppler
group (P = 0.57).
Discussion
There were no differences in the number of postopera-
tive complications or length of hospital stay when GDFT
was guided by PVI instead of esophageal Doppler during
major open abdominal surgical procedures.
Previous studies show that both length of stay and in-
cidence of complications were reduced when PVI was
used as a part of a colorectal surgery multimodal en-
hanced recovery protocol in 109 patients, compared to
historical controls [24]. The use of PVI also decreased
perioperative lactate levels compared to controls [6, 25].
Warnakulasuriya et al. [8] reported no difference in
short term outcome when PVI was compared to esopha-
geal Doppler in 40 patients. Based on these reports and
our findings, a clinician wishing to pursue GDFT can
choose PVI over esophageal Doppler in the large major-
ity of patients undergoing major open abdominal sur-
gery. PVI, in contrast to esophageal Doppler, is not
sensitive to interference from diathermy and does not
require frequent access to the patient’s head for probe

 repositioning. Also, PVI can be measured without single-use
equipment avoiding the cost for single-use esophageal
probes (USD 130 in our setting). However, as illustrated by
the request for Doppler data in two PVI patients, the clin-
ician might still want to have access to a reliable method for
measuring intraoperative cardiac output to increase the
amount of hemodynamic information during unusually
complex situations or in cases of known vascular and/or
myocardial dysfunction. Data on cardiac output and thus
contractility, systemic vascular resistance and oxygen delivery
were available in the Doppler group but not incorporated in
the treatment protocol, and decisions about inotropic and/or
vasoactive support in both groups were left to the clinical
judgement of the responsible anesthetist. Despite the more
extensive hemodynamic information in the Doppler group,
beside more use of the vasopressor phenylephrine in the PVI
group, the amount of inotropic support did not differ be-
tween the treatment groups.
Other non-invasive methods for dynamic monitoring
are available. One meta-analysis reported the offline as-
sessment of respiratory variation in pulse oximetry
plethysmographic waveform amplitude (ΔPOP) for pre-
dicting fluid responsiveness to be comparable to that of
PVI (AUC 0.89 vs 0.95), but this technique is as yet not
available in real time [26]. Also, pulse pressure variation and
stroke volume variation can now be obtained non-invasively
using the Nexfin/Clearsight™ or the CNAP™ systems, but
their capacity for predicting fluid responsiveness differs be-
tween studies [27–30]. The same applies to measurements
of the variability of the diameter of the caval vein or other
veins during positive pressure ventilation [31]. Contrary to
PVI, the effect on clinical outcome of all these techniques
has to the best of our knowledge not been studied.
PVI is a dynamic indicator of fluid responsiveness
based on cardiopulmonary interaction while stroke vol-
ume optimization is not. As both methods are claimed
to be of benefit for fluid management, we argue that
these methods, though differing in concept, can be com-
pared with each other in a randomized trial focusing on
clinical outcome [3]. Maintaining a patient below a
certain PVI value might appear to be less aggressive
then aiming for the plateau of the Starling curve, but
this depends on the selected cut-off values. Probably,
a higher cut off value for PVI with the same settings
(such as tidal volume) would have resulted in less
fluid administration and vice versa. We have previ-
ously shown that a PVI value of 10.5% was optimal in
this material [9].

 Limitations
Limitations of this study include the absence of a control
group without either PVI or Doppler to guide volume
optimization. Early reports on stroke volume optimization
using the esophageal Doppler were favorable [32]. Since
then the technique has been questioned, partly because of
negative studies on GDFT involving esophageal Doppler
[33] and other devices [34, 35], and partly because of
questions raised about the Doppler method itself [36].
Based on our results, it is not possible to tell whether PVI
and Doppler both result in similar improvements in out-
come, or whether neither method improves outcome
when compared to treatment without GDFT. Such a con-
trol group was reflected upon at the time of designing the
study (2011), but deemed unethical since, based on the
evidence available at that time, we felt there was no equi-
poise about the benefits of GDFT. Equipoise about the
use of GDFT is supported by our findings previously re-
ported about the limited ability of both PVI and Doppler
to predict fluid responsiveness [9]. Also protocol compli-
ance, in terms of time during surgery with achieved PVI
and SV goals respectively, was not recorded.
The amount of fluid used during the optimizations
represents a part of the total fluid given, because of the
per protocol complementary colloid fluid administration
during the induction of anesthesia and for bleeding, and
crystalloid fluid for maintenance and for the correction
of preoperative dehydration. This increased the possibil-
ity that both groups would receive similar amounts of
fluid; however, we did not find a difference between the
groups in the amount of colloids used specifically for the
optimizations.
We selected a difference of 10% in number of complica-
tions at 30 days to determine required sample size. There-
fore the study was not powered to detect smaller albeit
still significant differences in postoperative outcome. Also,
it could be discussed whether a non-inferiority approach
would have been more adequate. This would entail a lar-
ger required sample size.
The studies which were used to determine sample size
scored complications in different ways and reported inci-
dences of complications which are higher than can be
expected in current practice using improved surgical
and anesthetic techniques. The findings of this study
cannot be applied to laparoscopic surgery. The majority
of patients, although undergoing major surgery, were
classified as ASA 1 or 2. The potential of GDFT to
improve postoperative outcome is more pronounced
in patients at higher risk of complications [37], and
this could have influenced the possibility to find dif-
ferences in outcome between the methods. Also, since
intraoperative blood pressure is correlated to postop-
erative outcome, a target MAP should have been spe-
cified in the protocol.
Since the reliability of dynamic parameters including
PVI increases with increasing tidal volume, a tidal vol-
ume of 8 ml kg− 1 (ideal or actual body weight) or more
is often recommended [38]. However, as large tidal

 volumes are probably detrimental in surgical patients
[39] we, in line with earlier reports evaluating PVI, chose
a tidal volume of 7 ml kg− 1 ideal body weight [6, 7, 13].
Whether or not outcome is improved by using larger
tidal volumes in surgical patients monitored with dy-
namic parameters is unknown.
Conclusions
We found no differences regarding number of postoper-
ative complications or length of hospital stay between
using PVI or esophageal Doppler for goal directed fluid
therapy. PVI appears to be an acceptable alternative to
esophageal Doppler for goal directed fluid therapy dur-
ing major open abdominal surgery.
