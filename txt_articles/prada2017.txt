Summary
Background Air particulate matter is a ubiquitous environmental exposure associated with oxidation, inflammation, 
and age-related chronic disease. Whether particulate matter is associated with loss of bone mineral density and risk 
of bone fractures is undetermined. We did two independent studies with complementary designs, objectives, and 
measures to determine the relationship between ambient concentrations of particulate matter and bone health.
Methods In the first study, we examined the association of long-term concentrations of particulate matter less than 
2·5 μm (PM2·5) and osteoporosis-related fracture hospital admissions among 9·2 million Medicare enrollees 
(aged ≥65 years) of the northeast-mid-Atlantic USA between January, 2003, and December, 2010. In the second study, 
we examined the association of long-term black carbon and PM2·5 concentrations with serum calcium homoeostasis 
biomarkers (parathyroid hormone, calcium, and 25-hydroxyvitamin [25(OH)D]) and annualised bone mineral density 
over 8 years (baseline, November, 2002–July, 2005; follow-up, June, 2010–October, 2012) of 692 middle-aged (46·7 years 
[SD12·3]), low-income men from the Boston Area Community Health/Bone Survey (BACH/Bone study) cohort. 
PM2·5
  concentrations were estimated using spatiotemporal hybrid modelling including Aerosol Optical Depth data, 
spatial smoothing, and local predictors. Black carbon concentrations were estimated using spatiotemporal land-use 
regression models.
Findings In the Medicare analysis, risk of bone fracture admissions at osteoporosis-related sites was greater in areas 
with higher PM2·5 concentrations (risk ratio [RR] 1·041, 95% CI 1·030 to 1·051). This risk was particularly high among 
low-income communities (RR 1·076, 95% CI 1·052 to 1·100). In the longitudinal BACH/Bone study, baseline black 
carbon and PM2·5 concentrations were associated with lower serum parathyroid hormone (β=–1·16, 
95% CI –1·93 to –0·38, p=0·004, for 1 IQR increase [0·106 μg/m³] in the 1-year average of black carbon concentrations; 
β=–7·39, 95% CI –14·17 to –0·61, p=0·03, for 1 IQR increase [2·18 μg/m³] in the 1-year average of PM2·5 
concentrations). Black carbon concentration was associated with higher bone mineral density loss over time at 
multiple anatomical sites, including femoral neck (–0·08% per year for 1 IQR increase, 95% CI –0·14 to –0·02) and 
ultradistal radius (–0·06% per year for 1 IQR increase, –0·12 to –0·01). Black carbon and PM2·5 concentrations were 
not associated with serum calcium or serum 25(OH)D concentrations.
Interpretation Our results suggest that poor air quality is a modifiable risk factor for bone fractures and osteoporosis, 
especially in low-income communities.

Introduction
In the USA, about 2·1 million osteoporosis-related bone 
fractures are reported each year, resulting in as much as 
US$20·3 billion in annual direct health costs.1 Within 
1 year of a bone fracture, death risks for older individuals 
increase by 10–20%2 with only 40% regaining full 
pre-fracture independence.1,3 Identification of novel, 
preventable risk factors for bone loss and fractures is an 
urgent global priority.4,5
Ambient concentrations of particulate matter air 
pollution have been associated with increased morbidity, 
hospitalisation, and mortality from cardiovascular6–8 and 
respiratory diseases,9,10 as well as with cancer11,12 and 
impaired cognition.13–15 Particulate matter causes systemic 
oxidative damage16 and inflammation,17 which can result 
in accelerated bone loss and increased risk of bone 
fractures in older individuals. Tobacco smoke, which 
contains several toxic components also found in 
particulate matter, has been repeatedly associated with 
decreased bone mineral density18 and increased risk 
of bone fractures.19 However, evidence on whether 
individuals living in areas with higher concentrations of 
particulate matter have higher risk of bone fractures is 
inconclusive. No longitudinal study has investigated

ambient particulate matter in relation to bone mineral 
loss over time, and there is no available data on particulate 
matter and calcium homoeostasis in adults.
To determine the relationship between ambient 
concentrations of particulate matter and bone health, we 
did two independent studies with complementary designs, 
objectives, and measures: using data on 763 630 hospital 
admissions from 9·2 million Medicare enrollees in the 
northeast-mid-Atlantic USA from 2003 to 2010, we 
determined 
whether 
communities 
with 
higher 
concentrations of particulate matter less than 2·5 μm in 
aerodynamic diameter (PM2·5) had higher rates of hospital 
admissions for osteoporosis-related bone fractures among 
older persons (≥65 years old); in a longitudinal study of 
692 middle-aged (mean age 47·5 years [SD 12·8]), low-
income men from the Boston Area Community Health/
Bone Survey cohort (BACH/Bone study), we determined 
whether PM2·5 concentrations and traffic-derived ambient 
particulate 
matter—as 
traced 
through 
ambient 
concentrations of black carbon—were associated with 
altered markers of calcium homoeostasis, including 
serum parathyroid hormone, 25-hydroxy 
vitamin D 
(25(OH)D), and calcium, as well as changes in bone 
mineral density over approximately 8 years of follow-up.
Methods
Medicare analysis
Study design and data sources
We obtained 2003–10 hospital admission data for 
osteoporosis-related bone fractures from approximately 
9·2 million beneficiaries of Medicare, aged 65 years or 
older, who lived in 3974 zip codes of 13 northeast-mid-
Atlantic US states located east of the 81° W meridian, for 
which we recently developed a high-resolution hybrid 
model for estimating PM2·5 concentrations (figure 1).20 We 
identified primary hospital admissions for osteoporotic-
related fractures using the International Classification of 
Diseases, 9th revision (appendix pp 2–5) and compiled 
data on number of admissions per year per zip code. 
Covariate data at the zip code level were collected from 
various sources (eg, 2000 Census, Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention; appendix p 6) and presented in 
their original unit to ensure accuracy. Medicare data are 
previously collected administrative data and, therefore, 
did not require individual patient consent.
Procedures
Annual PM2·5 concentrations between 2003 and 2010 
were estimated using a recently developed and 
validated (mean out-of-sample R²=0·88) spatio-temporal 
prediction model that incorporates satellite aerosol optical 
depth data, spatial smoothing, and local predictors.21 We 
generated daily PM2·5 predictions at 1 × 1 km spatial 
resolution, as previously described20 and calculated 1-year 
averages of PM2·5 concentrations specific to each zip code 
for each calendar year. The exposure dataset with yearly 
averages of PM2·5 concentrations at a 1 × 1 km spatial 
resolution was matched to zip codes using ArcGIS 
(a geographic information system) and SAS based on 
spatial location and date. For zip codes that covered 
several grids, a weighted exposure average was calculated 
for each zip code based on all covered 1 × 1 km grid cells.
Statistical analysis
We estimated the association of 1-year PM2·5 averages 
with annual rates of bone fracture hospital admissions 
using 
generalised 
linear 
mixed 
models 
(PROC 
GLIMMIX; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) with Poisson 
distribution and random intercepts for zip code. We 
considered the Akaike information criterion and 
residuals’ plots to evaluate goodness-of-fit. We adjusted 
the final model for the multiple zip code-level 
confounders described in the appendix (p 6). We used 
Medicare data on age that provides per each zip code the 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Exposure to particulate matter induces oxidative damage and 
inflammation, which might affect bone health, particularly of 
older populations. Smoking, which contains several 
components of particulate matter, has been consistently 
associated with bone damage. However, whether ambient 
particulate matter concentrations affect calcium metabolism, 
bone damage, and risk of fractures is uncertain.
Added value of this study
We demonstrate for the first time higher rates of hospital 
admissions for bone fractures in communities with higher 
ambient concentrations of particulate matter less than 
2·5 μm in aerodynamic diameter. Participants living at 
addresses with higher concentrations of traffic-derived 
particulate matter exhibit lower serum parathyroid hormone 
concentrations and higher decreases in bone mineral density 
over an 8-year follow-up.
Implications of all the available evidence
This study provides evidence that long-term exposure to 
particulate matter—a persistent environmental issue in Europe 
and globally—is an independent risk factor for bone fractures, 
possibly involving changes in parathyroid hormone 
concentrations. These associations might disproportionately 
affect under-privileged communities. We found the association 
of particulate matter well below the annual average limits set 
by the US Environmental Protection Agency and the European 
Union. Improvements in particulate air pollution 
concentrations might ameliorate bone health, prevent bone 
fractures, and reduce the health cost burden associated with 
fractures in older individuals.

percentage of the population aged between 65 and 
74 years and the percentage older than 75 years. We also 
adjusted for number of days below 0°C to minimise the 
potential impact of fall risk due to freezing weather. 
Urban and rural areas were classified according to the 
Rural–Urban commuting area from the US Department 
of Agriculture, which classifies US census tracts using 
measures of population density, urbanisation, and daily 
commuting. In separate models, we tested interaction 
terms between zip code characteristics and PM2·5 
concentrations. p<0·05 was considered significant.
BACH/Bone study
Study design and participants
The BACH/Bone study is a population-based longitudinal 
study of musculoskeletal health, including 1219 low-
income black, Hispanic, and white male residents of 
Greater Boston, MA, USA, aged 30–79 years.22 Data were 
collected at baseline (November, 2002–July, 2005) and 
follow-up (June, 2010–October, 2012) examinations from 
a total of 692 participants, who completed follow-up 
assessments.
The institutional review boards at the New England 
Research Institute and Boston University School of 
Medicine (BUSM) approved the protocols. Each 
participant provided written informed consent.
Procedures
Physical activity level was measured using the Physical 
Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE).23 Frequency and 
duration of leisure activities, work (hours per week), and 
housework and similar duties (yes or no) over the 
previous week were recorded for each participant. The 
PASE score was computed by multiplying the amount of 
time spent in each activity (hours per week) in each 
activity by empirical item weights and summing over all 
activities. PASE measurements were categorised as low 
(0–99), middle (100–249), and high (≥250). Measurements 
of participants’ height and weight were obtained using a 
stadiometer (Seca Corporation, Hanover, MD, USA) 
and digital scale (Tanita, Arlington Heights, IL, USA), 
respectively. Body-mass index (BMI) was calculated by 
dividing measured weight (kg) by the square of measured 
height (m²). Information about dietary habits was 
obtained by survey in participants’ homes using the 
Block food frequency questionnaire.24
Smoking was determined using data from in-person 
interviews; the questionnaires assessed whether men 
had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and 
whether they were currently smoking. Smoking status 
was defined as current smoker (smoked >100 cigarettes 
and currently a smoker), never smokers (smoked

<100 cigarettes lifetime and not currently smoking), or 
former smokers (smoked >100 cigarettes lifetime and 
currently not smoking). In the case of former and current 
smokers, questions were administered to determine the 
usual number of cigarettes smoked per day and for how 
many years they had smoked; then, pack-years of 
smoking were calculated by multiplying the number of 
packs (20 cigarettes in one pack) smoked per day by the 
number of years smoked. Additional information about 
the BACH/Bone cohort has been published previously.22,25
We measured serum bio-intact parathyroid hormone, 
serum calcium at baseline, and serum 25(OH)D (ie, 
25(OH)D2+25(OH)D3), as previously described.26 Trained 
and certified technicians measured bone mineral density at 
both baseline and follow-up at five different locations 
(femoral neck, total hip, lumbar spine [L1–L4], distal radius, 
ultradistal radius) with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry 
(DXA) using a Hologic/QDR4500W densitometer (Hologic 
Inc, Waltham, MA, USA). To facilitate study operations, 
and in consideration of the 6-year lag between the baseline 
and follow-up measure, we did not require the same 
technician to do the two bone mineral density scans on 
each participant. However, all technicians were specifically 
trained and certified to use standardised procedures to 
reduce between-operator variability. Unfortunately, no 
measures of operator variability were collected. However, 
the total variability was very small: indeed, to reduce 
technical variability in bone mineral density measurements, 
the DXA system was monitored weekly for drift and the 
coefficient of variations for bone mineral density were less 
than 1·5%. We calculated annualised changes in bone 
mineral density between baseline and follow-up scans, and 
we calculated annualised change in percentage from the 
difference between the first and last measurement.
Examinations, 
including 
in-person 
interviews, 
questionnaires, anthropometries, and blood draws were 
done at the BUSM-General Clinical Research Unit.
To estimate PM2·5 concentrations, we used the same 
spatiotemporal hybrid modelling approach20 described 
for the Medicare analysis, but using a 1 × 1 km model 
instead of zip code areas, which allowed more precise 
data about exposure.20 Due to the unavailability of 1 × 1 
km satellite data before 2003, PM2·5 predictions could be 
obtained—as an annual average—only for participants 
with baseline visits in 2004–05 (ie, only 282 of the total 
692 participants). We obtained finer-scale and more 
complete (n=692) estimates of particle concentrations by 
calculating concentrations of black carbon—a measure 
of particulate matter from vehicular traffic emissions 
and the dominant type of particulate matter in urban 
areas—using a validated spatiotemporal land-use 
regression model that provided daily estimates of black 
carbon concentrations throughout the greater Boston 
area since 1995, as previously reported.27 To capture large 
local variability of vehicular traffic particles, the black 
carbon model generated estimates for each individual 
address rather than for grid cells. We calculated 1-year 
averages of PM2·5 and black carbon at baseline using 
365 daily estimates for each participant using their 
residential address before the date of their baseline bone 
mineral density assessment.
Statistical analysis
We used linear regression to estimate the association of 
long-term PM2·5 and black carbon concentrations (1-year 
average PM2·5 and black carbon concentrations before 
bone mineral density measurement) with baseline 
parathyroid hormone, calcium, and serum 25(OH)D

concentrations. We used three sets of models: unadjusted; 
adjusted for age, race, and height; and adjusted for age, 
race, height, smoking, per-capita household income, 
physical activity, caffeine consumption, and weight. We 
used similar sets of linear regression models to evaluate 
the association of baseline PM2·5 and black carbon 
concentrations (1-year average) with change in bone 
mineral density between baseline and approximately 
8-year examinations.28 We rescaled the effect estimate to 
percent change to facilitate comparison of results 
with previous studies.29,30 SUDAAN software (RTI 
International, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) was 
used for all analyses. Observations were weighted 
inversely to their probability of selection at baseline. 
Weights were also adjusted for non-response bias at 
the follow-up assessment and post-stratified to the 
Boston census population in 2000 (appendix p 8). The 
multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE) 
algorithm in R was used to impute missing data,31 taking 
into account the complex survey sampling design and 
maintaining the observed relationships in the data. MICE 
imputes missing values with estimated predictions from 
regression models and 15 datasets were multiply imputed 
and used for analysis.32,33 Imputed missing data were less 
than 5% per variable. p<0·05 was considered significant.
Role of the funding source
The sponsors of the study had no role in the study design, 
data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or 
writing of the manuscript. The corresponding authors 
had full access to all the data in the study and had final 
responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.
Results
In the Medicare analysis, the area included in the analysis 
had a total population of 62 million, of which about 
9·2 million (about 15%) were Medicare beneficiaries. 
Characteristics of zip code areas are in the appendix (p 8). 
From 2003 to 2010, 763 630 Medicare beneficiaries were 
admitted with a primary diagnosis of osteoporosis-related 
bone fracture. Communities with higher annual PM2·5 
concentrations had higher rates of bone fracture 
admissions in analyses controlling for relevant covariates. 
One IQR (4·18 μg/m³) increase in PM2·5 was associated 
with a 4·1 % (risk ratio [RR] 1·041, 95% CI 1·030 to 1·051; 
p=0·0001) higher rate of hospital admission for bone 
fracture (table 1) in models adjusted for sociodemographic 
variables, geographical characteristics, obesity, number of 
days with freezing temperatures (<0°C), and calendar year. 
A plot of the corresponding partial residuals obtained from 
a model controlling for all covariates except PM2·5 
demonstrated a subtle, near-linear covariate-adjusted 
association between PM2·5 and rates of bone fracture 
admissions (figure 2). The plot also showed that there 
remained substantial variability in bone fracture admission 
rates. Using a regression spline to fit PM2·5 concentration 
in the multivariable-adjusted regression model, we 
confirmed that the relationship between PM2·5 and rates of 
bone fractures was nearly linear across the entire range of 
PM2·5 concentrations (3–22 μg/m³; figure 2). The 
associations of PM2·5 with bone fractures were robust and 
stable across six alternative regression models including 
different sets of covariates (appendix p 9). Risk ratios were 
similar between women (RR 1·046, 95% CI 1·036 to 1·056; 
p=0·0002) and men (RR 1·037, 1·027 to 1·047; p=0·0008; 
table 1). The association of PM2·5 with bone fracture 
admission rates was higher among those communities in 
the lowest obesity rate quartile (RR 1·105, 95% CI 
1·080 to 1·129; p=0·0007) compared with those with 
highest obesity rates (RR 1·038, 0·763 to 1·312; p=0·13; 
pinteraction=0·011). The effect modification by socioeconomic 
variables (percentage of population with high school level 
per zip code and median income per zip code), percentage 
of population white, non-Hispanic per zip code, and 
percentage of obesity per zip code, on the association 
between long-term PM2·5 and hospital admissions by bone 
fractures are shown in table 2.

Participants in the BACH/Bone study included men 
aged 30–79 years, including 523 (66·9%) participants with 
annual household income less than US$30 000 and 
274 (39·6%) who were white. We present additional 
characteristics of the participants at baseline, including 
bone 
mineral 
density, 
PM2·5, 
and 
black 
carbon 
concentrations in table 3. Participants living in locations 
with higher concentrations of black carbon had lower 
concentrations of serum parathyroid hormone (β=–1·16, 
95% CI –1·93 to –0·38, p=0·004 in the fully adjusted 
model for 1 IQR increase [0·106 μg/m³] in the 1-year 
average of black carbon concentrations). PM2·5 also 
showed a negative association with serum parathyroid 
concentrations (β estimate=–7·39, 95% CI –14·17 to 
–0·61, p=0·03 in the fully adjusted model for 1 IQR 
[2·18 μg/m³] increase in the 1-year average of PM2·5 
concentrations). Black carbon and PM2·5 concentrations 
were not associated with serum calcium or serum 25(OH)
D concentrations and results were robust across 
alternative regression models (table 4).
At baseline, bone mineral density measures of the 
BACH/Bone study participants were not associated with 
PM2·5 or black carbon concentrations at their residential 
address (table 5). During the 8-year follow-up, participants 
living at locations with higher concentrations of ambient 
particles, particularly black carbon concentrations, showed 
higher loss of bone mineral density at multiple anatomical

sites (table 6). For each 1 IQR (0·106 μg/m²) increase in 
1-year black carbon concentration at baseline, participants 
had a 0·08% per year (95% CI –0·14 to –0·02; p=0·009) 
decrease in femoral neck bone mineral density and 0·06% 
per year (–0·12 to –0·01; p=0·04) decrease in ultradistal 
radius bone mineral density in fully adjusted models, 
equivalent to 3914 cases per year attributable to PM2·5. 
Bone mineral density showed non-significant negative 
associations at one-third distal radius, total hip, and L1–L4 
vertebrae (table 6). Associations remained robust across 
alternative regression models (table 6) and relatively linear 
despite some non-influential outliers (appendix p 10). In 
the subset of participants with available PM2·5 data (n=282), 
1-year average PM2·5 concentrations at baseline were 
negatively, but non-significantly, associated with changes 
in bone mineral density for most anatomical sites 
evaluated (table 6).
Discussion
In our analysis of approximately 9·2 million Medicare 
beneficiaries, we found evidence of an association 
between PM2·5 concentrations and rates of hospital 
admissions for bone fractures, independent of sex and 
community-level confounding factors. PM2·5 associations 
were stronger in communities with lower income, despite 
a protective influence of obesity rates. This result suggests 
that per each 4·18 μg/m³ increase in PM2·5, there is a 
4·1% higher rate of hospital admission for bone fractures 
in older individuals. In the prospective BACH/Bone study 
of middle-aged, low-income men, we also found that 
participants living at addresses with higher concentrations 
of PM2·5 and black carbon exhibited lower serum 
parathyroid hormone concentrations. Black carbon was 
associated with decreases in bone mineral density over 
8 years of follow-up. These findings indicate poor air 
quality as a possible risk factor for bone mineral density 
loss and fractures in older individuals, which might 
disproportionately affect low-income men. Reducing 
emissions as a result of innovation in technologies or 
policy changes in emission standards of this modifiable 
risk factor might reduce the impact of air pollution on 
bone fractures and osteoporosis.
Air particles might, directly or indirectly, impact bone 
biology and increase bone mineral loss. Air pollution 
particles have high potential to cause systemic oxidative 
damage34 and inflammation,17 both of which are 
established mechanisms for bone demineralisation and 
osteoporosis.35 Tobacco smoke, which includes several 
chemo-physical components found in particulate matter, 
causes bone mineral loss in animal experiments36 and has 
been associated with higher risk of bone fractures and 
increased bone mineral loss in studies of human beings.19 
Parathyroid hormone concentrations are also significantly 
lower in smokers37,38 and return to non-smoking 
concentrations after smoking cessation.38 Such parathyroid 
hormone alteration might represent an adaptive response 
to smoking-induced calcium mobilisation from bone.38 
Our findings suggest that similar mechanisms might also 
be activated in response to particulate matter. Similarities 
between particulate matter and smoking might also 
suggest a potential role of renal calcium handling,39,40 but 
unfortunately no data about renal calcium were available 
in the BACH/Bone cohort.
Very few studies have investigated the association of air 
pollution concentrations with bone health and bone 
fractures. A cross-sectional study of 5976 middle-aged and 
older individuals living in Norway (15·23% with forearm 
fractures, about 910 cases) described an association of 
long-term PM2·5 concentrations with the prevalence of self-
reported forearm fractures after the age of 50 years, but the 
association was evident only among male smokers.41 A 
previous study of 590 men aged 75–76 years showed a 
cross-sectional correlation of long-term PM2·5 and PM10 
concentrations with lower total body bone mineral 
density.42 Previous studies have also reported higher rates 
of bone fractures and age-related osteoporosis in urban 
areas compared with rural regions.43,44 For example, urban 
women have a 29% higher relative risk of forearm fracture 
and lower bone mineral density compared with women in 
rural areas.45 Our Medicare analysis controlled for urban 
and rural locations. It is possible that our study is prone to 
residual 
confounding. 
However, 
considering 
the 
consistency between different models (appendix p 9), it is 
unlikely the observed association of particulate matter on 
hospital admissions by bone fractures reflects confounding 
due to lifestyle or other socioeconomic differences between 
urban and rural areas. We used yearly counts of admissions 
for each zip code area and specified a Poisson distribution. 
We applied generalised mixed models because we have 
counts for each zip code and then we included a random 
intercept for zip code to take into account the characteristics 
of each zip code. By using this Poisson regression, we 
accounted for temporal variation of counts by year and for 
the spatial variation with the zip code level. We did not 
evaluate daily time series because we were interested in

the long-term effect of PM2·5. The magnitude of the relative 
risk we found in the Medicare analysis is similar to the 
very well established associations between air pollution 
and other health outcomes (eg, myocardial infarction, 
stroke, and total mortality).46 Indeed, air pollution is 
considered a weak, but universal risk factor; therefore, it 
causes a proportionally higher number of attributable 
cases than other risk factors with higher relative risks but 
lower frequency.47
Several epidemiological studies have shown that 
socioeconomic factors, race,48,49 and obesity50–52 are related 
to bone mineral density. Low socioeconomic status has 
been associated with 25(OH)D insufficiency, higher 
concentrations of parathyroid hormone, lower values of 
bone mineral density, and a higher prevalence of fragility 
fractures.53 
Also, 
despite 
lower 
serum 
25(OH)D 
concentrations and dietary calcium intake, African 
Americans have higher bone mineral density and develop 
osteoporosis less frequently than do European Americans.54 
Our Medicare analysis showed a significant interaction of 
socioeconomic variables (education and income), but also 
of race and obesity, confirming those previous factors. For 
example, we found that the association of PM2·5 exposure 
with bone fracture admission rates was higher among 
those communities in the lowest obesity rate quartile 
compared with those with the highest obesity rates, 
suggesting a protective influence of obesity rates.
During the 8-year follow-up in the BACH/Bone study, 
middle-aged, low-income men living at locations with 
higher concentrations of black carbon had larger 
annualised decreases in bone mineral density. Black 
carbon, a major component of fine particles measured 
by PM2·5, is a tracer of particles from traffic and might 
share different toxicological properties compared with 
other components of particulate matter. Therefore, our 
results indicate that particles from traffic are crucial 
contributors 
to 
decreased 
bone 
health. 
PM2·5 
concentrations showed only weak and non-significant 
associations with both annualised changes in bone 
mineral density and serum parathyroid hormone 
concentrations. However, the PM2·5 analysis included 
only about 40% of the BACH/Bone participants due to 
unavailability of PM2·5 model predictions in the early 
years of the study. Lack of significance could be 
attributable to the lower number of middle-aged, low-
income men—compared with the black carbon 
analysis—with long-term PM2·5 data, but this result has 
the potential of selection bias for lack of data in the full 
BACH/Bone cohort. In the BACH/Bone study, we did 
not observe an association between long-term black 
carbon exposure and bone mineral density at baseline, 
but we found associations with yearly change between 
baseline and follow-up bone mineral density in the 
longitudinal analysis. Lack of association in the cross-
sectional analysis of 1-year average black carbon exposure 
and bone mineral density at baseline might indicate that 
individuals are less susceptible to black carbon at a 
younger age and, consequently, effects were observed 
only as participants aged during the follow-up analysis.55
We observed a negative association between long-term 
black carbon exposure and reduction in femoral neck 
and ultradistal radius bone mineral density. Although 
non-significant, negative associations between black 
carbon and one-third distal radius, total hip, and lumbar 
vertebral bone mineral density were also observed. Our 
study is consistent with the finding that air pollution

contributes to bone health impairment reported by 
different groups.42,56–58 Chen and colleagues58 showed 
that traffic-related exposure was associated with lower 
body bone mineral density. Also, Chang and colleagues57 
found an association between air pollution (carbon 
monoxide and nitrogen dioxide) and increased risk of 
osteoporosis. The difference in observed associations 
across multiple anatomical sites might be explained by 
differential anatomical susceptibility to the effects of 
particulate matter on bones.59 Alvaer and colleagues42 
reported sex differences in the association between air 
pollution and bone mineral density, with an association 
observed only for men. However, our finding from the 
Medicare analysis suggested that the impacts of ambient 
particulate air pollution on bone health might not be 
different between men and women. The difference in 
conclusion and findings between our study and the 
Oslo Health Study might be explained by age differences 
of the participants. This finding suggests that the 
potential adverse consequences of ambient particulate 
air pollution on bone health might be similar in men 
and women.
The two studies reported in this paper have notable 
limitations. The Medicare analysis used an ecological 
design and has limited capability of establishing causality. 
The analysis was done at zip code level and does not allow 
for evaluating the association of long-term PM2·5 exposure 
with hospital admissions at the individual level. To avoid 
the potential ecological fallacy,60 we complemented 
the Medicare analysis with the BACH/Bone study to 
investigate the impact of individual-level environmental 
risk factors on bone health. However, the Medicare 
analysis included a large number of hospital admissions 
for osteoporotic-related bone fractures in older individuals, 
over a large and heterogeneous geographical region in the 
USA. The Medicare analysis might also be subject to 
selection bias, which is always a concern in observational 
studies. However, all individuals aged 65 years or older are 
encouraged to enrol in the free Medicare programme. 
Based on the enrolment criteria of Medicare beneficiaries, 
we assume that the Medicare enrollees are representative 
of the ageing population in the northeast-mid-Atlantic 
USA. We acknowledge a major limitation in that the 
hospital admission data were not validated, therefore we 
cannot exclude coding errors. However, based on study 
operations, misclassification is unlikely to be differential 
in areas with low and high particulate matter 
concentrations. Therefore, coding errors are likely to 
result by non-differential measurement error, and are 
expected to bias the association towards the null rather 
than producing the observed associations. Furthermore, 
although our Medicare analysis was adjusted for risk 
factors of fractures at the zip code level, there are other 
known risk factors for falls and bone fractures that were 
not available from Medicare data. However, most factors 
were accounted for at the individual level in the 
BACH/Bone study. Therefore, combining the two studies 
limits concerns about population-level analysis and bias 
from known confounders.
We acknowledge that the analysis done in the 
BACH/Bone study has several limitations due to 
moderate sample size and lack of generalisability, given 
that the cohort included 692 men only. However, to the 
best of our knowledge, only one study has reported the 
association between particulate matter exposure and 
bone fractures.41 Nonetheless, the BACH/Bone study is 
distinctly unique because of the prospective bone 
mineral 
density 
assessment 
at 
two 
timepoints. 
Furthermore, in the Medicare analysis, we found similar 
associations of PM2·5 with bone fracture rates in both 
men 
and 
women, 
which 
strengthened 
and 
complemented the findings from the BACH/Bone study. 
However, we assigned the closest particulate matter 
exposure available both in the Medicare study as in the 
BACH/Bone study but long-term particulate matter 
exposure was not directly measured and no personal 
data were available. Also, our results could be influenced 
by other unmeasured individual factors, such as 
ultraviolet exposure or calcium intake, among others, 
that can modify bone health and that were not evaluated 
here. Likewise, although our models used specifically 
concentrations of PM2·5 (for the Medicare study and for a 
subset of participants in the BACH/Bone study) and 
black carbon (for the BACH/Bone study), we cannot 
exclude that the effect we observed might be mediated 
by other air pollutants or by the combination of them. 
Additionally, the DXA-based bone mineral density 
measures used might not detect microstructural 
alterations that are not readily apparent. Therefore, bone 
mineral density might fail to fully capture alterations 
related to bone health.61 We also acknowledge potential 
misclassification, especially in the BACH/Bone study, 
but this is likely to be non-differential (ie, the 
measurement error of exposure in the BACH/Bone 
study is unlikely to be dependent on bone mineral 
density status), therefore it is expected to bias our results 
towards the null. Other air pollutants such as carbon 
monoxide and nitrogen dioxide have been previously 
associated 
with 
bone 
loss 
and 
osteoporosis.42,57 
Unfortunately, we did not have access to carbon 
monoxide and nitrogen dioxide exposure data for the 
Medicare study nor for the BACH/Bone study, limiting 
our capability to explore these associations. Further 
analyses to evaluate the role of PM2.5 and black carbon, as 
well as of carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide on 
bone health are warranted. Finally, although we have 
adjusted for multiple potential confounders (smoking, 
race, physical activity, and income) in the BACH/Bone 
study, our results might not be sufficient to rule out 
selection bias, especially in the PM2·5 model in which the 
number of participants was low.
We found evidence of an association between air 
particle concentrations and increased rates of hospital 
admissions for bone fractures in older Medicare

beneficiaries, particularly in low-income communities. 
In the BACH/Bone study follow-up of middle-aged 
low-income men, participants living in areas with higher 
air particle concentrations had lower serum parathyroid 
hormone concentrations and reductions in bone mineral 
density. All associations were linear and observed—at 
least for part of the PM2·5 distribution—at PM2·5 
concentrations below the annual average limits set by the 
US Environmental Protection Agency (12 µg/m³) and the 
European Union (25 µg/m³),62 as well by other countries, 
such as China (40 µg/m³)63 and Japan (15 µg/m³).64 Our 
findings support an association between long-term 
exposure to particulate air pollution and reduced bone 
health, particularly among low-income older individuals. 
Improvements in particulate air pollution concentrations 
could contribute to substantial better bone health, 
prevent bone fractures, and reduce the health costs 
associated with fractures, particularly in elderly and low-
income populations.
