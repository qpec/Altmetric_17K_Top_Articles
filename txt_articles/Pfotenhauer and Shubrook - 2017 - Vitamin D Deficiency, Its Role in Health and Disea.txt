Vitamin D deficiency has been identified as a common metabolic/endocrine
abnormality. Despite known dietary sources of vitamin D and the role of sun-
light in its production, much of the US population may have inadequate levels
of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Deficiency of vitamin D can be caused by a
variety of health conditions, but studies on the effects of vitamin D supple-
ments have had mixed results. This evidence-based clinical review discusses
what is currently known about vitamin D and what areas need further
research to clarify its role in health and disease.

O
wing to food fortification, diseases caused by severe vitamin D deficiency,
such as rickets and osteomalacia, were virtually eradicated in the United
States by the early 1900s. However, inadequate sun exposure and chronic
disease continue to cause vitamin D deficiency in all age groups.1 Vitamin D deficiency
(<20 ng/mL) and insufficiency (20-30 ng/mL) affect almost 1 billion people worldwide.1
Considered a hormone rather than a vitamin, vitamin D has receptors on virtually every
cell in the human body.2 In addition to bone metabolism, vitamin D has many roles in
the body, including cell growth modulation, neuromuscular and immune function, and
inflammation reduction.3 It remains debatable, however, whether healthy levels of
vitamin D can reduce the risk of nonskeletal diseases. The role of vitamin D in multiple
sclerosis, autoimmune disorders, infections, respiratory disease, cardiometabolic
disease, cancer, and fracture risk is still being studied. In light of how prevalent it is,
knowing whom to test and when to treat patients for vitamin D deficiency is essential
for primary care physicians.
As with many diseases, assessment and management of vitamin D deficiency should
be consistent with osteopathic principles, including the relationship of nutrition and life-
style changes with musculoskeletal health and the body’s ability to regulate health when
proper self-care is achieved.
Physiology
Vitamin D is produced when the skin is exposed to sunlight.4 UV-B photons act on pro–
vitamin D3, a precursor in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, in the plasma membrane
of epidermal cells to form pre–vitamin D3.1 Pre–vitamin D3 is rapidly transformed into
vitamin D3 and transferred to the extracellular space where it binds to vitamin D–binding

 protein.1 From there it is transported to the liver, where
it is hydroxylated into 25(OH)D.5 Serum concentration
of vitamin 25(OH)D is the best indicator of its status.3
Dietary sources of vitamin D include fatty fish
(salmon, tuna, sardines, swordfish), cod liver oil, egg
yolks, portabella mushrooms, beef liver, and fortified
foods such as breakfast cereal, milk (dairy and nondairy),
infant formula, cheese, and orange juice.3,6 Fortified
foods in the United States use synthetic vitamin D2
(ergocalciferol) derived from irradiation of ergosterol
found in plants, mold ergot, or plankton. Dietary vitamin
D is absorbed in the small intestine, incorporated into
chylomicrons, and then transported to the liver bound to
vitamin D–binding protein.5,7 From the liver, 25(OH)D
travels to the kidney bound to vitamin D–binding
protein.5,7 The kidney further hydroxylates 25(OH)D to
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]2D), the most active
form.4 Once in the active form, 1,25(OH)2D (calcitriol)
travels to the rest of the body and any cells with vitamin
D receptors.5 Vitamin 1,25(OH)2D has a shorter half-life
and is not as good of an indicator of vitamin D status in
the absence of advanced renal disease.3
Risk Factors for Deficiency
Insufficient
sunlight
exposure,
inadequate
dietary
sources, and malabsorption are common causes of
deficient intake.
The amount of UV-B exposure for any individual
varies based of the time of day, season, latitude, alti-
tude, clothing, sunscreen use, skin pigmentation, and
age.8,9 Anyone residing in latitudes greater than 37°
does not receive enough UV-B radiation to produce any
vitamin D during winter months.7 Age further compli-
cates adequate sunlight exposure. An adult older than
70 years needs almost 3 times the duration of sun
exposure to produce the same amount of vitamin D as a
child.1 A diet low in foods rich in vitamin D may also
lead to deficiency. Infants are at risk of vitamin D defi-
ciency if they are exclusively breastfed.6
Malabsorption of vitamin D can result from disorders
that affect the gastrointestinal tract, including Crohn
disease, celiac disease, chronic active hepatitis, chronic
kidney disease (CKD) with or without requiring dialysis,
chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, diabetes mellitus,
gastric bypass, and primary biliary cirrhosis.1,10-15
Advanced liver disease, CKD, and alcohol abuse are
the
most
common causes
of
defective activation.1
Increased catabolism of vitamin D can be caused by
certain medications, such as anticonvulsants, glucocorti-
coids, antifungals such as ketoconazole, and highly active
antiretroviral therapy.1
Vitamin D is fat soluble, and evidence exists that it
becomes sequestered in adipose tissue.16 Researchers
measured serum 25(OH)D in 3890 third-generation par-
ticipants of the Framingham Heart Study without cardio-
vascular disease and diabetes. They found decreased 25
(OH)D levels with greater body mass index that could
not be accounted for in variations in physical activity or
diet. They also found an inverse relationship between 25
(OH)D and subcutaneous and visceral adiposity even in
lean individuals.16 This area needs further research to
clarify the relationship and mechanism.
Potential Risks of Vitamin D
Deficiency
Some observational studies suggest an association
between low levels of 25(OH)D and increased risk of
KEY POINTS
Routine screening should be done only for patients at risk
for vitamin D deficiency.
Patients with vitamin D deficiency should take vitamin D
supplements to maintain bone health.
Vitamin D3 may be preferred over vitamin D2.
Replacement dose for adults should be 50,000 IU weekly or
6000 IU daily.
There may be additional benefits of vitamin D
supplementation, but further evidence is needed to support
recommendations.

 metabolic, neoplastic, and immune disorders, such as
diabetes mellitus and multiple sclerosis. To date,
however, no adequate randomized controlled trials
have assessed whether vitamin D supplements reduce
the risk of chronic diseases other than osteoporosis.1
Diagnosis
The 2013 US Preventive Services Task Force guide-
lines17 and the 2011 Endocrine Society guidelines18 rec-
ommend screening only those at risk for vitamin D
deficiency. Serum 25(OH)D, the major circulating form
of vitamin D, has a half-life of 2 to 3 weeks compared
with 1,25(OH)2D, which has a circulating half-life of 4
hours.18 In CKD and inherited disorders of 25(OH)D
and phosphate metabolism, both 25(OH)D and 1,25
(OH)2D should be measured.18 Multiple assays are avail-
able to measure 25(OH)D but with great variability in
results. Therefore, treatment should target a goal above
normal levels to ensure adequate levels of 25(OH)D.18
Vitamin D deficiency is generally recognized as a
25(OH)D level below 20 ng/mL.1 Below this level,
patients may be at an increased risk for muscle weak-
ness, bone pain, and fragility fractures.19 Vitamin D
insufficiency has been defined as a serum 25(OH)D
level of 21 to 29 ng/mL without overt clinical symp-
toms,18,20
although
definitions
have
been
greatly
debated. Intestinal absorption of dietary calcium and
phosphorus is decreased with vitamin D deficiency,
which causes an increase in parathyroid hormone
levels.18 Parathyroid hormone begins to plateau in
adults with 25(OH)D levels between 30 and 40 ng/
mL. This range is consistent with the threshold for hip
and nonvertebral fracture prevention.18
Treatment
The Institute of Medicine recommends 600 IU of
vitamin D per day to meet the needs of most people
aged 1 to 70 years. Those older than 70 years may
need 800 IU per day,21 assuming minimal sun expos-
ure. The Endocrine Society recommends 1500 to 2000
IU per day for adults and 1000 IU for children.18
Vitamin D should be given with calcium to maintain
bone health in those who are deficient.
Currently, there is no consensus as to which form of
supplemental vitamin D is superior. However, one ran-
domized,
double
blind,
placebo-controlled
study
looked at
supplementation
with vitamin
D2 and
vitamin D3 in 85 healthy persons for 25 weeks starting
at the end of summer. Researchers found that vitamin
D3 was more effective than vitamin D2 in maintaining
serum 25(OH)D levels during the fall and winter
months.22 They also found a relative decrease in serum
25(OH)D3 levels in the group that was given vitamin
D2 supplements.22 A single 50,000-IU dose of D2 or
D3 produced similar increases in total 25(OH)D, but
D3 had a longer half-life.8
All adults found to be vitamin D deficient should be
treated with either 50,000 IU of vitamin D3 per week
or 6000 IU per day for 8 weeks to achieve a serum
25(OH)D level of 30 ng/mL.17 Treatment should be
followed by a maintenance dose.17 The Endocrine
Society’s guidelines18 support this recommendation but
add that a maintenance dose of 1000 IU per day may
be needed to consistently raise serum 25(OH)D levels
above 30 ng/mL in patients aged 1 to 18 years and as
much as 1500 to 2000 IU per day in patients aged 19
to 50 years. It is unknown at this time whether these
treatment recommendations are enough to provide all
of the potential nonskeletal health benefits associated
with vitamin D, specifically those that maximize
muscle function.18 In patients with malabsorption syn-
dromes, with obesity, or taking medications that affect
vitamin D metabolism, maintenance doses may need to
be between 3000 and 6000 IU daily.18
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends
that all children receive 400 IU per day of vitamin D
from their first few days of life through adolescence.23
Vitamin D deficiency in children has been reported to
be between 10% and 65% and, therefore, rickets con-
tinues to be reported in the United States.23 Breastfed
infants are at a higher risk of vitamin D deficiency
because breast milk contains little to no vitamin D.6

 Only 5% to 13% of breastfed children met a previous
recommendation of 200 IU per day.22 Children found
to be deficient in vitamin D should be treated with
either 50,000 IU per week or 2000 IU per day for 6
weeks to achieve serum 25(OH)D levels of 30 ng/mL.17
In a 2014 report, the American Geriatrics Society
recommended vitamin D supplementation of 1000 IU
per day or more plus calcium for all adults aged 65
years or older to reduce the risk of fracture and falls.24
Further investigation contradicted the meta-analysis
results showing reduction of falls with vitamin D sup-
plements.25 The Endocrine Society does not currently
recommend supplements solely for fall prevention,
prevention of cardiovascular disease or death, or
improvement in quality of life.17 For patients taking
vitamin D supplements for deficiency, routine labora-
tory testing to monitor 25(OH)D levels is not recom-
mended as long as the prescribed dose is within the
recommended limits.24 Further investigation contra-
dicted the meta-analysis results and found that vitamin
D supplements did not reduce falls.
Ongoing Research and Future
Directions
Although research on vitamin D continues to accumu-
late, concrete recommendations beyond improving bone
health have yet to be elucidated. In a 2014 umbrella
review of observational and randomized controlled trials,
the relationships between vitamin D and 137 outcomes
were explored.25 Researchers found only probable asso-
ciations between vitamin D concentrations and birth
weight, dental cavities in children, maternal vitamin D
concentrations at term, and parathyroid hormone concen-
trations in patients with CKD requiring dialysis.25
Evidence did not support the idea that vitamin D supple-
ments alone increased bone mineral density or reduced
the risk of fractures or falls among older people.25
Although vitamin D is thought to influence many
disease processes, the evidence is currently insufficient
to support supplementation to enhance extraskeletal
benefits. The umbrella review25 of vitamin D research
revealed some evidence for decreased risk of colorectal
cancer, nonvertebral fractures, cardiovascular disease
prevalence, hypertension, ischemic stroke, high body
mass index, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes,
small for gestational age–birth, and gestational dia-
betes mellitus; decreased balance sway, alkaline phos-
phatase concentrations in patients with CKD requiring
dialysis, and parathyroid hormone concentrations in
patients
with
CKD
not
requiring
dialysis;
and
increased head circumference at birth, low density
lipoprotein cholesterol levels, bone mineral density in
the femoral neck, and muscle strength. However, the
conclusion was that more evidence is needed.
Another 2014 review of vitamin D and all-cause
mortality found an inverse association with circulating
25(OH)D.26 This association was specifically evident
for coronary artery disease, lymphoma, cancer of the
upper digestive tract, and disorders of the respiratory
tract.26 These findings were supported by a 2015 study
in which low 25(OH)D levels were associated with an
increased risk of microvascular and macrovascular com-
plications in persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus.27
This finding remained statistically significant after mul-
tivariable adjustment.27 Intervention with all forms of
vitamin D, when given alone, did not reduce overall
mortality significantly among older adults. However,
when supplementation with vitamin D3 alone was
reviewed, all-cause mortality was reduced by 11%.26
Strong evidence for the range of health benefits and
risks may come out of the Vitamin D and Omega 3
Trial.28,29 This study is evaluating 26,000 adults aged
50 years and older who are receiving vitamin D sup-
plements, omega-3 fatty acids, both, or placebo to
determine the prospective risk of cancer and cardiovas-
cular disease. These results are not expected until after
2020.
