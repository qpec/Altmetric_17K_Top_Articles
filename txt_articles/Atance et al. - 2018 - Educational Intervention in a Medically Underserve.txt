Context: Medical students from rural and medically underserved areas (MUAs) are
more likely than their peers to practice medicine in rural areas and MUAs. However,
students from MUAs are also more likely to face socioeconomic barriers to a career
in medicine.
Objective: To determine whether a week-long summer enrichment experience
(SEE) at Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine-Carolinas could successfully
teach high school students from MUAs basic biomedical concepts and foster an
interest in medicine and the health sciences.
Methods: The SEE program is open to high school students in the Spartanburg,
South Carolina, area. The program includes interactive lectures, laboratories, demon-
strations on gross anatomy prosections, demonstrations on medical simulation
models, tours of emergency vehicles, an introduction to osteopathic manipulative
medicine, and student-led research projects. Participants were asked to complete a
15-question quiz that assessed their knowledge of basic biomedical concepts and a
10-question survey that assessed their attitudes toward careers in medicine and
health sciences. Both the quiz and the survey were completed on both the first and
final days of the program. The data were analyzed using paired t tests.
Results: Participant knowledge of basic biomedical concepts, as determined by the
quiz scores, increased after completion of the program (9.1 average correct answers
vs 12.6 average correct answers) (P<.001). Participant attitude toward medicine and
the health sciences improved in 9 of the 10 items surveyed after completion of the
program (P<.05).
Conclusions: Participant knowledge of basic biomedical concepts and their knowl-
edge of and interest in careers in the health sciences improved after completing the
SEE program. These findings suggest that educational interventions for high school
students could help to develop primary care physicians for rural areas and MUAs
and that there is a role for osteopathic medical schools to nurture these students as
early as possible.

 A
key social determinant of health for people
living in rural areas is access to health care.1
In South Carolina, 40% of the population
lives in medically underserved areas (MUAs), particu-
larly with respect to primary care physicians. As of
late 2017, 216 additional primary care physicians were
needed to resolve this shortage.2 Osteopathic medical
schools have a long tradition of successfully producing
primary care physicians who practice in rural areas and
MUAs.3-5 Part of this success can be attributed to
recruiting medical students from rural areas and
MUAs, because these students are more likely to prac-
tice in rural areas and MUAs.6-10 However, people
living in rural areas and MUAs have fewer opportun-
ities for educational achievement.1 Therefore, part of
recruiting medical students from MUAs involves reach-
ing these prospective students before matriculation into
medical school.
Educational interventions are an important compo-
nent in removing socioeconomic barriers to educational
success.11-13 In the 1970s, recognition of the socio-
economic barriers that were preventing women from
pursuing careers in science began to emerge.14 By the
1980s, systematic research on addressing and removing
such barriers was done, and these findings may be
transferable to other disadvantaged groups.14 Pipeline
programs that seek to increase representation of specific
groups in science, math, and engineering have been
successful.8,15-19 Programs specifically geared toward
medicine vary widely in scope and duration, but they
generally feature an underlying theme of improving
accessibility to careers in medicine. For instance, the
University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences created a
national outreach program that targets kindergarten
through twelfth-grade students and teachers and uses
various modalities, including weekly sessions, inten-
sive workshops, and individual courses, to inform parti-
cipants about the health sciences.20 Similarly, the
University of Alabama Rural Health Leaders Pipeline
is a comprehensive program with the goal of improving
health care in small towns and rural areas in Alabama.
The program targets rural students from elementary
school through residency, with an emphasis on
minorities.21
Although these programs are very large in scale and
require considerable institutional support, smaller-scale
programs can also be effective in igniting interest in
careers in medicine. The West Virginia School of
Osteopathic Medicine hosted a 1-day mini–medical
school program for high school students that success-
fully inspired students to pursue careers in medicine.22
The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland hosted a
4-day mini–medical school program for suburban and
rural high school students, and they found that the
program was effective in introducing students to
careers in medicine.23
We sought to expand on these types of assessments by
measuring the effectiveness of the week-long summer
enrichment program at the Edward Via College of
Osteopathic Medicine (VCOM). The summer enrichment
experience (SEE) was initiated at the Virginia campus in
2008 and the Carolinas campus (VCOM-Carolinas) in
2014. In particular, we wanted to assess students’ acquisi-
tion of basic knowledge during the program. We
hypothesized that the SEE program would increase par-
ticipant knowledge of basic biomedical concepts and
improve their knowledge of and attitudes toward the prac-
tice of medicine and the health sciences.
Methods
This study was determined to be exempt by VCOM’s
institutional review board. As such, parental consent
was not required for participation of the high school
students involved. Nonetheless, all SEE participants
were informed that the collected data might be used
for curriculum write-up or publication purposes, and
they were free to decline participation. Participants in
the 2015 SEE program were included in the study.
Program Description
The VCOM-Carolinas SEE program is designed for high
school students from MUAs who demonstrate academic
aptitude and an interest in medicine and the health

 sciences. The program is open to all rising sophomores,
juniors, and seniors in the Spartanburg, South Carolina,
area with a minimum cumulative grade point average of
3.0. Participants were primarily recruited by the VCOM
website and promotional flyers that were delivered to all
Spartanburg County high schools. Flyers were also dis-
tributed to churches, clubs, and community organiza-
tions. Applications were reviewed by SEE program
administrators to ensure that applicants met the specified
criteria. The SEE program is free of charge and takes
place over 2 weeks in summer (1 week for boys and 1
week for girls). The program is nonresidential, with parti-
cipants attending Monday through Thursday from 9 AM
to 4 PM and Friday from 9 AM to 12 PM.
To teach participants basic biomedical knowledge, the
program includes short interactive lectures, hands-on
laboratories, demonstrations on gross anatomy prosec-
tions, demonstrations on medical simulation models,
tours of emergency vehicles, an introduction to osteo-
pathic manipulative medicine, and student-led research
projects. The lectures are delivered by medical school
faculty, and the laboratories and demonstrations are con-
ducted by faculty, medical students, or outside medical
professionals. Each day focuses on a different body
system, which allows participants to experience a simula-
tion of VCOM’s systems-based academic blocks. To
instill a desire in participants to pursue careers in medi-
cine and the health sciences, structured time was allotted
daily for participants to engage in basic career counseling
with medical students, VCOM admissions specialists,
practicing physicians, other medical professionals, and
PhD faculty.
Interventions
To analyze the first part of our hypothesis, a
15-question multiple-choice quiz was designed by par-
ticipating faculty (including J.A.) and administered to
participants. The quiz was taken by all participants on
the first morning of the program, before any content
was delivered, and again on the final morning of the
program. Participants were allowed as much time as
needed to complete the quiz. To analyze the second
part of our hypothesis, a 10-question survey was
administered immediately after completion of the quiz
on the mornings of the first and last day of the
program. Each question was rated on a 5-point Likert
scale ranging from 1 (“did not feel very sure about the
statement”) to 5 (“felt very sure about the statement”).
Participants were allowed as much time as needed to
complete the survey.
All of the responses from the quizzes and surveys
were collected, deidentified, and input into a spread-
sheet. The data were analyzed using paired t tests to
determine whether the program resulted in significant
differences in participants’ knowledge and attitudes.
Statistical significance was defined as P<.05.
Results
The quiz was taken by all 45 students (12 boys and 33
girls) at the start and conclusion of the program. One
participant failed to complete both quizzes, so that
data point was discarded. Therefore, the response rate
was 98% (44 of 45 participants). The mean (SD)
number of correct answers for all participants was 9.1
(2.06) on the preprogram quiz and 12.6 (1.65) on the
postprogram quiz (P<.001).
The survey was taken by all 45 participants at the
start and conclusion of the program. Survey results are
shown in the Table. Participants’ attitudes toward the
practice of medicine and the health sciences and knowl-
edge of careers in medicine and the health sciences sig-
nificantly increased (P<.05) between the pre- and
postprogram survey for all but 1 of the questions. In
response to the question, “I would like to go to
medical school in the future,” scores increased from a
mean (SD) of 4.2 (1.08) to 4.3 (0.86) from the pre- to
postprogram survey; however, this increase was not
statistically significant (P=.22).
Discussion
Many osteopathic medical schools are dedicated to pro-
ducing primary care physicians, in particular, to work

 in rural areas and MUAs. It has been shown that
medical students recruited from rural areas and MUAs
are more likely to return to these areas to practice.6-10
One concern is that prospective medical school candi-
dates from rural areas and MUAs face barriers to realiz-
ing their potential. However, there is evidence that
educational outreach to students from MUAs is part of
a successful strategy in overcoming barriers to scholas-
tic achievement.11-13
Results of the quiz demonstrate that participants’
knowledge of basic biomedical concepts significantly
improved
after
the
1-week
program
(P<.001).
According to the instructions given, participants knew
they would be retested on the same questions at the
conclusion of the week, but answers were not discussed
until after the postprogram quiz was completed. As a
further means of reducing bias, no effort was made to
specifically teach quiz content during the week.
Similar findings have been observed in other science
programs. For instance, Moore24 showed that eighth
graders demonstrated process skills acquisition after
completing a 3-week science program. Williams et al25
demonstrated that attending a 2-week robotics camp
enhanced middle schoolers’ knowledge of physics.
These results, along with results of the current study,
suggest that middle and high school students can learn
about basic biomedical knowledge in just 1 week,
even outside of the regular school year.
Perhaps more importantly than knowledge accrued, we
anticipated that the SEE program would improve partici-
pants’ attitudes toward and knowledge of careers in
medicine and the health sciences. The results of the
survey demonstrate significant increases in knowledge
and improvement in attitude regarding the practice of
medicine and the health sciences. This result has been
demonstrated by others, which confirms that programs
like SEE are fulfilling their objective of enhancing youth
interest in medicine and the health sciences.22,23,26,27
Results of only 1 of the 10 survey questions did not
show a statistically significant improvement from the
pre- to postprogram survey. In response to the question,

 scores increased, but not significantly (P=.22). There
are a few ways to interpret this finding. Most likely, par-
ticipants already displayed a strong desire to attend
medical school before the program began. Students
with a demonstrated aptitude for and interest in medi-
cine and the health sciences were purposely recruited
for the program, so medical school may have already
been a consideration for them. It is also possible the
question was misinterpreted. Participant desire to
pursue a career as an osteopathic physician increased,
so, presumably, desire to attend medical school
should mirror desire for a career in osteopathic medi-
cine. However, it is possible that 1 or both of these
closely related questions caused confusion among
participants.
Our main future direction will be to evaluate the
long-term effects of the SEE program (eg, examining
whether students who complete the SEE program
attend medical school or other health science pro-
grams). This endeavor will most likely be achieved by
directly tracing education and career outcomes for
program participants, a process that may take several
years to accomplish but would lend credibility to the
effectiveness of educational interventions. In subse-
quent years, collection of data similar to those in this
study would improve sample size and reduce bias
arising from analysis of a single year.
Conclusion
The results of this study indicate that a week-long
summer enrichment program for high school students
is effective in successfully imparting or reinforcing
basic biomedical concepts and improving student atti-
tudes toward and knowledge of careers in medicine
and the health sciences. These findings suggest that
basic educational interventions for high school students
should be part of a long-term strategy to develop
primary care physicians for rural areas and MUAs. We
believe there is a role for osteopathic medical schools
to nurture these students as early as possible in their
scholastic development.
