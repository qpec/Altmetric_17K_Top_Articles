Investigation performed at University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada
Background: The risk of injury associated with American football is significant, with recent reports indicating that football has one
of the highest rates of all-cause injury, including concussion, of all major sports. There are limited studies examining risk factors for
injuries in the National Football League (NFL).
Purpose: To identify risk factors for NFL concussions and musculoskeletal injuries.
Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3.
Methods: Injury report data were collected prospectively for each week over the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 regular seasons for all
32 teams. Poisson regression models were used to identify the relationship between predetermined variables and the risk of the 5
most frequent injuries (knee, ankle, hamstring, shoulder, and concussion).
Results: A total of 480 games or 960 team games (TGs) from the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 regular seasons were included in this
study. A trend to an increasing risk of concussion and TG ankle injury with decreasing mean game-day temperature was observed.
The risk of TG concussion (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 2.16; 95% CI, 1.35-3.45; P ¼ .001) and TG ankle injury (IRR, 1.48; 95% CI,
1.10-1.98; P ¼ .01) was significantly greater for TGs played at a mean game-day temperature of �9.7�C (�49.5�F) compared with a
mean game-day temperature of �21.0�C (�69.8�F). The risk of TG shoulder injury was significantly increased for TGs played on
grass surfaces (IRR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.02-1.81; P ¼ .038) compared with synthetic surfaces. The risk of TG injury was not associated
with time in season, altitude, time zone change prior to game, or distance traveled to a game.
Conclusion: This study evaluated extrinsic risk factors for injury in the NFL. A hazardous association was identified for risk of
concussion and ankle injury with colder game-day temperature. Further research should be conducted to substantiate this rela-
tionship and its potential implication for injury prevention initiatives.

The risk of injury associated with American football is
significant, with recent reports indicating that football has
one of the highest rates of all-cause injury, including con-
cussion, of all major sports.20 The National Football League
(NFL) has attempted to reduce the injury burden of its
athletes through the introduction of numerous rule
changes,2 implementation of a novel concussion-screening
program and management protocols,3 and the development
of an educational campaign for injury awareness.15 The
NFL is concomitantly exploring league-wide restructuring
with proposals to increase the number of games played per
season12 and expand the geographic borders by increasing
the number of games played outside the United States.13
These changes would increase volume of competition and
travel requirements for players, despite limited informa-
tion on the effect these variables will have on injury risk.
The impact of existing modifiable and nonmodifiable
variables on injury risk within the NFL should be assessed
to provide guidance for future injury prevention and gen-
eral league-restructuring strategies. One accepted
approach to inform injury prevention initiatives involves
a 4-stage strategy, which includes (1) establishing the inci-
dence and frequency of injuries within a particular sport,
(2) identifying risk factors for injury, (3) introducing injury
prevention strategies targeting the identified modifiable
risk factors, and (4) evaluating the efficacy of the imple-
mented interventions.43
It has been previously documented that within the NFL,
the knee is most frequently injured, followed by the ankle,

 hamstring, shoulder, and the head/concussion.20 There are
limited data documenting risk factors associated with
injury in the NFL, with previous studies focusing on the
relationship between injury incidence and type of playing
surface16,30 and the altitude at which games are played.26
Recently, Teramato et al41 identified an association
between the style of play and risk of concussion in the NFL.
Broadening the search for factors associated with adverse
injury outcomes remains one of the primary strategies for
informing targeted player safety initiatives and can provide
insight into the potential influence of prospective plans for
league expansion on injury risk. Thus, the purpose of this
study was to investigate the relationship between extrinsic
risk factors (game, scheduling, and meteorological vari-
ables) and injuries in the NFL.
METHODS
National Football League Injury Reports
Official NFL injury reports are published weekly online by
all 32 teams on each team’s official website as well as on the
official NFL league-wide website. The NFL regular season
includes 16 games per team, played over a period of
17 weeks. Injury reports are published prior to each game
and therefore reflect injuries sustained in the previous
week’s game or in the current week’s practices. Injury data
pertaining to the final regular-season game (week 17) are
only available for the 12 teams that advance to the playoffs
and are not available for the 20 teams that are eliminated
and are no longer required to publish injury data. Injured
players who are not immediately available to participate
may be reported as being on the ‘‘injured reserve list’’ as
opposed to the weekly injury report. The injured reserve list
for each team is available online and is updated daily.8
Injury reports and the injured reserve list include the
following information of all players on the roster diagnosed
with an injury or illness by a team physician: player name,
position, anatomic area injured (eg, ankle, knee, hip,
shoulder, toe, head), practice status of a player for 3 prac-
tices during the week (eg, did not practice, limited partici-
pation, full participation), and game status (eg, probable to
play, doubtful to play, out).
Data Collection
All injury report and injured reserve data were collected
prospectively for each week over the 2012-2013 and
2013-2014 regular seasons for all 32 teams. An injury was
defined as any reported injury that was not documented on
the injury report 1 week immediately prior to the index
injury week. A concussion was defined as any injury
reported as a concussion or a head injury. The 5 most pre-
valent injuries in the NFL were previously documented and
include knee, ankle, hamstring, and shoulder injuries as
well as concussions.20 Injury reports do not identify the
situational context (ie, game vs practice) in which the
injury occurred; however, previous reports have documen-
ted that the majority of injuries during a football and NFL
season occur during games.7,22,24 Therefore, all injuries
were assumed to occur during games for data analysis and
modeling.
Additional situational and contextual data for each
team-game (TG) were collected retrospectively to identify
factors for an increased risk of TG injury. A TG was
defined as a team exposure to a game and, consequently,
for each game played there are 2 TGs. The included vari-
ables were selected based on previous reports of their asso-
ciation with hazardous outcomes in other sports and levels
of play. The predictor variables included the following:
game altitude,26,37 playing surface material,4,16,30,31,40
time in season,21,29,39 time zone change prior to a game,35
distance traveled to game,14 air temperature,29-31,34 game
outcome,11 game importance,25 and time between
games.10
Scheduling Variables. The following scheduling vari-
ables were collected for each TG:
1.
The number of days between the index TG and the
previous TG were classified as a short week (TGs
played <5 days after the previous TG), a normal week
(6-8 days), or a long week (10-15 days).
2.
The distanced traveled to a TG was calculated manu-
ally using the Google Maps ‘‘measure distance’’ func-
tion. The distance a team traveled for a TG was
defined as the distance between the center of their
home stadium to the center of the stadium in which
the TG was played. TGs were tertiled based on dis-
tance traveled, resulting in TGs with no distance
traveled (0 km [0 miles]), a short distance traveled
(108.28-1009.14 km [67.28-627.05 miles]), and a long
distance traveled (�1012.52 km [�629.15 miles]).
3.
The time-in-season describes the week in which the
TG was played and was analyzed in quartiles (weeks
1-4, 5-8, 9-12, and 13-16).
4.
Time zone (TZ) change prior to a TG describes the
absolute change in TZ between a team’s home TZ and
the TZ in which the game was played. The change in
TZ was categorized as �3 TZ compared with �2 TZ to
examine the maximal change in TZs (and greater) a
team may experience when playing within the
United States.
Game Variables. Information pertaining to game-
specific data was collected and included the following:
1.
The outcome (win, loss, or tie) of a TG, in which TGs
resulting in a win or tie were compared with a loss.
2.
The identification of TGs played against divisional
opponents compared with TGs not played against
divisional opponents.
3.
The playing surface type (grass, artificial turf, or a
hybrid grass/turf surface) available on each sta-
dium’s official website. Both turf and hybrid surfaces
were amalgamated and compared with natural grass
surfaces during the modeling analysis.
Meteorological Variables. Meteorological data were also
collected for each TG and included the following:
2
Lawrence et al
The Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine
 1.
The mean game-day temperature was retrospec-
tively collected for each game from an online meteor-
ological archive (wunderground.com). The mean
game-day temperature was quartiled for analysis
resulting in TGs played at �21.0�C (69.8�F), 16.9�C
to 20.8�C (62.4�F to 69.4�F), 10.0�C to 16.7�C (50.0�F
to 62.1�F), and �9.7�C (�49.5�F). For all indoor
stadiums and stadiums with retractable roofs, a
mean game-day temperature of 21.1�C (70�F) was
assumed, representing ‘‘room’’ temperature.
2.
The altitude of each stadium was obtained manually
from an elevation-approximation map (http://
www.daftlogic.com/sandbox-google-maps-find-alti-
tude.htm), which measures elevation based on coor-
dinates relative to sea level. The center of each
stadium was used as the point of reference for eleva-
tion data. The altitude of the games played were
quartiled, resulting in TGs played at �5.18 m
(16.99 feet), 5.87 to 121.02 m (19.26-397.05 feet),
142.03 to 216.34 m (465.98-709.78 feet), and
�220.59 m (�723.72 feet) above sea level. Altitude
cut-offs in each quartile were similar to previous
reports.26
Statistical Analysis and Ethics
In addition to descriptive statistics, Poisson regression
models were performed for each of the 5 most prevalent
TG injuries, including concussion, knee, ankle, hamstring,
and shoulder. Outcomes were analyzed at the level of the
TG as the included variables theoretically uniformly influ-
ence all players on a given team for each TG. A full model
including all variables was used for each outcome model
based on a priori hypotheses. Data for TGs played on week
17 were not included as week 17 injury data were only
available for 12 of the 32 TGs on week 17. A variance
inflation factor (VIF) was calculated to estimate multicol-
linearity of the included variables. The mean VIF of the
variables in the model was 1.12 (range, 1.02-1.25), sug-
gesting minimal correlation between predictor vari-
ables.28 To control for variable multiplicity in the
regression models, a significance level adjustment was
performed using false discovery rate (FDR) control to cal-
culate a new rejection criterion.5 All variables identified
with an initial significance level of a < .05 were subjected
to FDR significance level adjustment. All statistical anal-
yses were performed using STATA Data Analysis and
Statistical Software version 13.1 (StataCorp LP). An insti-
tutional review board deemed this study exempt from
requiring ethics approval, as all included data were
available in the public domain.
RESULTS
A total 512 regular season games, or 1024 TGs, were played
during the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 regular seasons, of
which 480 games or 960 TGs (93.8%) from weeks 1 through
16 were included in this study (Table 1).
A total of 4133 all-cause injuries were identified
in 1654 athletes. The most frequent injuries occurred
to the knee (n ¼ 746), followed by ankle (n ¼ 519), ham-
string (n ¼ 367), and shoulder (n ¼ 357); concussions
were the next most prevalent injury (n ¼ 296) (Table 2).
Concussion
A total of 296 concussions were identified in 249 TGs
(25.9%), while 711 TGs (74.1%) were concussion free
(Table 2). A trend to an increasing risk of concussion with
decreasing mean game-day temperature was observed
(Figure 1A). The risk of TG concussion was significantly
greater for TGs played at a mean game-day temperature
of �9.7�C (�49.5�F) compared with a mean game-day
temperature of �21.0�C (�69.8�F; incidence rate ratio
[IRR], 2.16; 95% CI, 1.35-3.45; P ¼ .001 <FDR) after con-
trolling for injury week, length of week, TG outcome,

game, and playing surface (Figure 1). Risk of TG concus-
sion was not associated with injury week, length of week,
TG outcome, divisional opponents, TZ change prior to TG,
altitude of the game, or playing surface.
Knee Injuries
A total of 746 knee injuries were identified in 500 TGs
(52.1%) (Table 2), with multiple knee injuries occurring in
184 TGs (19.2%) and 0 knee injuries occurring in 460 TGs
(47.9%). The risk of TG knee injury was not associated with
injury week, length of week, TG outcome, divisional oppo-
nents, TZ change prior to TG, altitude of the game, playing
surface, and mean game-day temperature (Figure 1B).
Ankle Injuries
A total of 519 ankle injuries were identified in 391 TGs
(40.7%), with multiple ankle injuries occurring in 100 TGs
(10.4%) (Table 2). The risk of TG ankle injury was signifi-
cantly greater for TGs played at a mean game-day tempera-
ture of �9.7�C (�49.5�F) compared with a mean game-day
temperature of �21.0�C (�69.8�F; IRR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.10-
1.98; P ¼ .01 <FDR) after controlling for all other covariates
(Figure 1C). Risk of TG ankle injury was not associated
with injury week, ‘‘length’’ of week, TG outcome, divisional
opponents, TZ change prior to TG, altitude of the game, and
playing surface. To note, the risk of TG ankle injury for TGs
with �3 TZs change prior to the TG (IRR, 0.58; 95% CI,
0.35-0.95; P ¼ .032 <.05) failed to reach significance after
FDR adjustment.
Hamstring Injuries
A total of 367 hamstring injuries were identified in 290 TGs
(30.2%), with multiple hamstring injuries occurring in 71
TGs (7.4%) (Table 2). The risk of TG hamstring injury was
not associated with injury week, length of week, TG out-
come, divisional opponents, TZ change prior to TG, altitude
of the game, playing surface, and mean game-day tempera-
ture (Figure 1D).
Shoulder Injuries
A total of 357 shoulder injuries were identified in 283 TGs
(29.5%), with multiple shoulder injuries occurring in 63
TGs (6.6%) (Table 2). The risk of TG shoulder injury was
significantly increased for TGs played on grass surfaces
(IRR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.02-1.81; P ¼ .038 <FDR) compared
with TGs played on turf surfaces after controlling for all
other covariates (Figure 1E). Risk of TG shoulder injury
was not associated with injury week, length of week, TG
outcome, divisional rival opponents, TZ change prior to TG,
altitude of the game, and mean game-day temperature. To
note, there was a trend to a reduced risk of TG shoulder
injury for TGs with �3 TZs change prior to the TG (IRR,
0.57; 95% CI, 0.30-1.06; P ¼ .074); however, this association
failed to reach significance.
DISCUSSION
This study identified risk factors associated with the 5 most
prevalent injuries in the NFL over 2 regular seasons
from 2012 to 2014. We identified an increased risk for con-
cussion and ankle injuries during games played at colder
temperatures and an increased risk of shoulder injuries for
games played on a grass surface. The risk of injury at any of
the included anatomic locations was not related to the time
in season, distance traveled to a game, change in TZ prior to
a game, game outcome, division opponents, and the altitude
at which the games were played.
We identified a greater risk of concussion for games
played at a mean game-day temperature of �9.7�C
(�49.5�F) and a trend of an increasing risk with decreasing
temperature. There is limited evidence examining the
effect of climatic temperature on concussion incidence.
Orchard et al31 examined the incidence of soccer injuries
in warmer compared with cooler climates in 3 professional
soccer leagues, and no significant association between cli-
matic temperature and concussion incidence was identi-
fied. Discussion surrounding the underlying etiology of
climatic temperature and concussion risk is speculative at
this time; however, we present several hypotheses. We
recognize that at lower temperatures, materials within the
playing environment (ie, the equipment and playing sur-
face) have a lower elastic potential and higher yield stres-
ses,33 which may generate greater impulse potentials

 during impacts and collisions. However, the change in the
properties of sports equipment and playing surfaces at
lower temperatures has not been well documented. Addi-
tionally, the observed relationship between concussion and
temperature may be attributed to changing athlete beha-
viors at lower game-day temperatures, although not previ-
ously documented. Colder temperatures can increase the
use of warming devices and equipment on the sideline
(eg, sideline coats, hand warmers, warm drinks).6 Access
to these devices may increase the likelihood of interaction
with athletic training and medical personnel and may facil-
itate earlier recognition of an injured athlete. Furthermore,
an athlete’s motivation to ascertain and achieve a warmer
milieu may be more conducive to earlier symptom self-
recognition through less distraction on the sidelines. Con-
versely, concussion symptomatology is nonspecific and can
share a common presentation with heat-related illness
(in the context of symptom onset during a collision sport).
In warmer temperatures, players may attribute concussive
symptoms to heat-related conditions (such as heat exhaus-
tion, dehydration, etc) and underreport concussion sympto-
matology in warmer temperatures. The relationship
between climatic temperature and concussion incidence
should be studied further prior to proposing modifying
game-day environment.
Additionally, there is a paucity of evidence documenting
the relationship between climatic temperature and
musculoskeletal injuries. Orchard et al30 identified a pro-
tective influence of colder temperatures on the risk of ankle
and knee injuries in the NFL over a 9-year period from 1989
to 1998. The authors attribute this protective influence of
colder temperatures to a lower shoe-surface traction with
decreasing temperature, with a greater influence on Astro-
Turf surfaces compared with natural grass. Discordantly,
we observed an increased risk of ankle injury for games
played at lower temperatures and no influence of tempera-
ture on the incidence of knee injury. This disparity may be
attributed to a shift away from using AstroTurf to more
natural synthetic and grass surfaces, which likely do not
undergo as significant a reduction in shoe-surface traction
at lower temperatures. We suggest that the hazardous
effect of colder temperature on ankle injuries is related to
intrinsic factors, as supported by literature suggesting that
reflexive responses, such as the Hoffman reflex, are dimin-
ished in cooler temperatures.9,18
No association between the risk of injury and the
number of days off between games was identified. This
does not support previous literature that documented an
association between myofascial injuries and both muscle
fatigue and overtraining.17,19,23,32 Furthermore, anecdotal
evidence from players and media reports suggest a shor-
tened week reduces preparation time and increases injury
risk.38,42 Additionally, some media reports suggest that
the ‘‘Thursday Night Football’’ television scheduling,

 which requires teams to play on a shortened week, is
associated with an increase in injury rates.36 The large
discrepancy in the reporting of the influence of the time
between NFL games and injury risk warrants further
investigation.
The results of this study failed to document an associa-
tion between the risk of concussion and the altitude at
which a game is played. Two previous studies reported a
reduced risk of concussions for games played at higher alti-
tudes. Myer et al26 documented a protective influence of
altitude on concussion risk in NFL athletes over the same
time period as the current study, while Smith et al37
observed the same relationship in all high school sports and
football, specifically. Both studies attribute the protective
influence of increasing altitude to physiological adaptations
that increase cerebral blood flow, venous engorgement, and
subsequently intracranial pressure resulting in a reduction
in intracranial compliance26,37; however, the validity of this
theory has been challenged.44,45
This study identified a small but increased risk of
shoulder injuries for games played on grass surfaces com-
pared with artificial turf. There was no relationship
between lower extremity injury and game surface mate-
rial. There is a large body of literature investigating the
influence of grass and synthetic surfaces on lower extre-
mity injuries with varying results.4,16,29,40 However, there
is limited evidence linking surface type to upper extremity
injuries. New synthetic surfaces have improved shock-
absorbing properties and may be more forgiving to direct
impacts to the shoulder. Furthermore, anecdotal evidence
and player reports suggest poor footing on newly sodded
soft grass surfaces27 potentially increasing the risk of falls
and shoulder impacts. The relationship between surface
material and upper extremity injury should be investi-
gated further.
The results of the current study demonstrated no influ-
ence of distance traveled to games and TZ change prior
to games on injury outcomes. These results provide no
impetus to censure NFL restructuring proposals to
expand the geographic borders of the league, which would
require teams to travel greater distances to games; how-
ever, strategies for ongoing evaluation of these variables
should be implemented.
This study has several limitations. First, the source of
data utilized for this study involved team-reported injury
data. The potential for discrepancy in reporting practices
between teams is large, and teams have previously been
investigated for improper reporting practices.1 Further-
more, injury data, apart from concussions, were limited to
anatomic location, and information regarding the diagnosis
or injury severity was not available. In addition, the injury
history of the athletes was not available and, therefore,
identifying recurrent and repeat versus new injuries was
not possible. The precise date of the injuries included in
this study was not available, and the timing of the injuries
was limited to the week in which the injury occurred. As
such, to calculate incidence rates we assumed all injuries
occurred during games, as previous reports indicate that
the majority of injuries in an NFL season occur during
games compared with practices.
CONCLUSION
This study evaluated risk factors for injury in the NFL and
identified a hazardous association between colder game-
day temperature and the risk of concussion and ankle
injury. Application of this information may aid in imple-
menting injury prevention strategies in the NFL. Preven-
tative measures to further explore and mitigate the risk of
injury in the NFL are warranted.
