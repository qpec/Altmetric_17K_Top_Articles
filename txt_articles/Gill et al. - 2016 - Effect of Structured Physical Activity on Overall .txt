Abstract
Background—The total time disabled likely has a greater influence on a patient’s quality of life 
than the initial occurrence alone.
Objective—To compare the effect of a long-term, structured physical activity program to a health 
education program on the proportion of patient assessments indicating major mobility disability 
(i.e., burden) and on the risk of transitions into and out of MMD.
Design—Single-blinded, parallel group randomized trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01072500)
Setting—Eight US centers between February 2010 and December 2013.
Participants—1635 sedentary persons, aged 70–89 years, who had functional limitations but 
were able to walk 400 m.
Interventions—Physical activity (n=818) and health education (n=817).
Measurements—MMD, defined by inability to walk 400 m, was assessed every 6 months for up 
to 3.5 years.
Results—Over a median follow-up of 2.7 years, the proportion of assessments with MMD was 
substantially lower in the physical activity group (0.13 [95% CI, 0.11–0.15]) than health education 
group (0.17 [95% CI, 0.15–0.19]), yielding a risk ratio of 0.75 (0.64–0.89). In a multi-state model, 
the hazard ratios (95% CI) for comparisons of physical activity with health education were 0.87 
(0.73–1.03) for the transition from no MMD to MMD, 0.52 (0.10–2.67) for no MMD to death, 
1.33 (0.99–1.77) for MMD to no MMD, and 1.92 (1.15–3.30) for MMD to death.
Limitations—The intention-to-treat principle was maintained for MMD burden and first 
transition out of no MMD, but not for subsequent transitions.
Conclusions—A structured physical activity program reduced the burden of major mobility 
disability over an extended period of time, in part through enhanced recovery after the onset of 
disability and diminished risk of subsequent disability episodes.

Maintaining independent mobility is an important goal of clinical medicine and public 
health, especially among older persons, who are at the greatest risk for disability. Older 
persons who lose independent mobility are less likely to remain in the community and have 
higher rates of morbidity, mortality, and self-care disability.(1–3) They also experience a 
diminished quality of life, with an increased likelihood of depression and social isolation.(1,

 4) In 2004, mobility disability among Medicare beneficiaries was estimated to contribute 
more than $42 billion in additional health care costs and over two-million additional 
hospitalizations.(3)
The Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) Study previously reported 
that a structured moderate-intensity physical activity program significantly reduced the 
initial occurrence of major mobility disability, compared with a health education program, 
over an average follow-up of 2.6 years among 1635 sedentary persons aged 70–89 who were 
nondisabled but had functional limitations.(5) Major mobility disability was defined as the 
inability to walk 400 m, a distance that is required to carry out many activities and, hence, to 
be fully independent in the community.(6) Such activities include shopping and walking 
across a parking lot, to the bus stop, and around a neighborhood.(7) The LIFE Study is the 
largest and longest randomized trial to evaluate the benefits of physical activity in older 
persons.(8, 9)
Prior research has shown that disability, including mobility disability, is a dynamic process, 
with older persons moving in and out of states of disability.(10, 11) After an initial 
occurrence of disability, episodes of recovery and recurrence contribute to the overall burden 
of mobility disability over time. From a patient’s perspective, the total time disabled likely 
has a greater influence on quality of life than the initial occurrence alone.(2) Hence, 
demonstrating that the physical activity program reduces the overall burden of major 
mobility disability, by facilitating recovery after an initial occurrence of disability and 
decreasing the likelihood of subsequent disability episodes (after recovery), would enhance 
its clinical and public health relevance. The primary goal of the current analysis was to 
evaluate the effect of the physical activity program, relative to that of the health education 
program, on the proportion (i.e. burden) of major mobility disability over time. To better 
understand these results, we also compared the risk of transitions into and out of major 
mobility disability (MMD) between the two groups.
METHODS
Trial Design and Participants
The LIFE Study was a multicenter, single-blinded randomized trial conducted at eight field 
centers across the US between February 2010 and December 2013. Details of the methods 
were published previously.(9) Men and women aged 70–89 were eligible if they (a) were 
sedentary (reported <20 min/week in past month performing regular physical activity and 
<125 min/week of moderate physical activity); (b) had functional limitations, defined by a 
Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) score(12) ≤9 out of 12; (c) could walk 400 m in 
≤15 minutes without help of another person or walker; (d) had no major cognitive 
impairment (Modified Mini-Mental State Examination(13) [3MSE] 1.5 standard deviations 
below education- and race-specific norms); and (e) could safely participate in the 
intervention as determined by medical history, physical exam and ECG. The primary 
recruitment strategy was targeted mass mailings to the community.(8) The current 
manuscript presents results for a secondary analysis that was not pre-specified in the study 
protocol but was pre-specified in a proposal that was approved by the LIFE Publications and 
Presentations Committee prior to initiation.

 The study protocol, available on request at https://www.thelifestudy.org/public/index.cfm, 
was approved by the institutional review boards at all participating sites. Written informed 
consent was obtained from all participants.
Randomization
Participants were randomized to a physical activity or health education program (Appendix 
Figure 1), via a secure web-based system using a permuted block algorithm (with random 
block lengths) stratified by field center and sex.
Interventions
The two interventions, including safety, have been previously described.(5, 9) The physical 
activity intervention consisted of walking, with a goal of 150 min/week, strength, flexibility, 
and balance training.(9) The intervention included two center-based visits per week and 
home-based activity 3–4 times per week. The behavioral strategies and operational details 
for implementing and maintaining the intervention over 3.5 years, including during and after 
extended leaves for hospitalizations and other illnesses or injuries, are provided elsewhere.
(14) Physical activity participants attended 63% of the scheduled sessions (median [IQR], 
71% [50%–83%]).(5)
The health education group attended weekly workshops during the first 26 weeks and 
monthly sessions thereafter. Workshops covered topics of relevance to older persons, such as 
negotiating the health care system, traveling safely, and preventive services. The program 
also included a 5- to 10-minute instructor-led program of upper extremity stretching 
exercises. Health education participants attended 73% of the scheduled sessions (median 
[IQR], 82% [63%–90%]).(5)
Data Collection
Participants returned to the clinic for follow-up every six months. The assessment staff were 
masked to the intervention assignment. Race/ethnicity were reported by the participants and 
were collected according to NIH requirements.
Outcomes—The outcomes for the current manuscript included the proportion of MMD 
(primary) and the risk of transitions into and out of MMD (secondary) over the entire 
follow-up period. MMD was defined as inability to walk 400 m within 15 minutes without a 
walker or personal assistance.(5) MMD was assessed during each follow-up visit through 
December 2013. When MMD could not be objectively measured, an alternative adjudication 
of the outcome was based on objective inability to walk 4 m in <10 seconds, or self-, proxy-, 
or medical record-reported inability to walk across a room.(5) If a definitive determination 
of MMD status could not be established based on this information, the specific observation 
(or state) was classified as “indeterminate”. When this information could not be obtained for 
a participant who was known to be alive, the specific observation (or state) was classified as 
“censored”. Reports of death were tracked through regular surveillance; and cardiovascular 
deaths (vs. non-cardiovascular deaths) were adjudicated based on medical records, death 
certificates, and proxy interviews.

 Statistical Analysis
Sample size was based on the primary outcome of time until first occurrence of MMD.(5) 
For descriptive purposes, the number (%) of transitions into and out of MMD across all time 
intervals was tabulated by intervention group.
To evaluate the relative effect of randomization to the physical activity program on the 
proportion (i.e. burden) of MMD over time, a marginal model within the framework of 
generalized estimating equations (GEE) for repeatedly measured outcomes was used. The 
primary GEE analysis used a log link, Poisson distribution to characterize the variance, first 
order autoregressive correlation matrix for estimation, and robust covariance for hypothesis 
testing. The effect of the intervention was summarized with a risk ratio (95% confidence 
interval [CI]), after adjusting for field center, sex and a follow-up time effect. Interaction 
terms were entered into the model to assess the consistency of the intervention effect across 
levels of five prespecified subgroups (age, sex, race/ethnicity, baseline SPPB score, and 
baseline 3MSE score). In the primary GEE analysis, the outcome was the presence/absence 
of MMD, with all other states evaluated as missing outcomes; however, in sensitivity 
analyses, the presence of MMD or death was considered the outcome. To account for 
missing outcomes, including the small proportion of participants (2.3%) who had no follow-
up data on MMD and the 6.5% (without death) to 7.5% (with death) of outcomes that were 
intermittently missing, additional sensitivity analyses were performed using multiple 
imputation. This approach, which is described in the Appendix (Section 1.0), ensured that 
the intention-to-treat principle would be maintained. All GEE analyses and multiple 
imputations were performed using SAS (SAS Institute), version 9.4.
A description of the multi-state survival models used to evaluate the bidirectional transitions, 
including model assumptions and fit, is provided in the Appendix (Section 2.0). In brief, 3-
state models based on first-order Markov assumptions were used to compare the risk of 
transitions into and out of MMD between participants randomized to the two intervention 
groups.(15, 16) These models, fit in the R msm package,(17) allowed participants to move 
bidirectionally between states representing the presence/absence of MMD and also 
contained an absorbing state for death. For the 3-state model (no MMD, MMD, death), 
indeterminate and censored were combined and treated as a censored state. Because only the 
first transition out of the no MMD state represents a purely randomized comparison, the 
model evaluated the association between intervention group and transition risk. Additional 
models were fit that: 1) evaluated differential intervention effects on transition risk within 
the first year versus subsequent years; 2) allowed the transition risk to be heterogeneous 
through time (e.g. different bidirectional risk in the first year versus subsequent years); and 
3) included baseline age, sex and cardiovascular history as covariates. Likelihood ratio tests 
were used to evaluate these additional models; and probabilities of transitions for 6-month 
intervals were obtained from the models.
For descriptive purposes, we estimated cumulative incidence, accounting for death as a 
competing risk, for the first three transitions within the health education group. Estimates 
were obtained for 1 and 2 years of follow-up for no MMD to first MMD. Due to limited 
follow-up, only 1-year estimates were obtained for first MMD to first recovery and first 
recovery to second MMD.

RESULTS
As previously described,(5) the baseline characteristics of the two groups were comparable. 
More than two out of five participants were 80 years or older, two-thirds were women, about 
a quarter were racial/ethnic minority, and two-thirds had some education beyond high 
school. The mean number of chronic conditions was 1.6, with hypertension (prevalence 
70.4%), cardiovascular disease (30.0%), and diabetes (25.4%) being most common. Nearly a 
third of participants had mild impairment in their cognition, based on a 3MSE score <90, 
and more than 40% had moderate or severe functional limitations, based on an SPPB score 
<8.
The median duration of follow-up was 2.7 years (interquartile range [IQR], 2.3–3.1) and did 
not differ between the groups. As shown in Table 1, there were 515 follow-up assessments 
with MMD in the physical activity group, representing 11.5% of the observations, and 724 
in the health education group, representing 16.0% of the observations. Based on the GEE 
model, the estimated proportion of follow-up assessments with MMD was substantially 
lower in the physical activity group (0.13 [95% CI, 0.11–0.15]) than health education group 
(0.17 [95% CI, 0.15–0.19]). When evaluated as a risk ratio, the burden of MMD over the 
entire follow-up period was significantly reduced by 25% [95% CI, 10%–37%] in the 
physical activity versus health education group (P=.002), as shown in Figure 1. The results 
did not differ significantly when participants were categorized by age, sex, race/ethnicity, 
baseline physical performance, or baseline cognition. In a strict intention-to-treat analysis 
(i.e. including participants with no follow-up), the benefit of physical activity was 
maintained (Table 2), with a 15% reduction even under an extreme set of imputation 
assumptions (MNAR).
As shown in Table 1, the percentages of all transitions from no MMD to MMD and from no 
MMD to death were larger in the health education than physical activity group, while the 
converse was observed for all transitions from MMD to no MMD and from MMD to death. 
Transitions from the indeterminate/censored state represented only a small percentage of all 
possible transitions (4.9%) and were similar between the physical activity (5.0%; 226 of 
4489) and health education (4.7%; 213 of 4515) groups. The overall percentage of 
transitions to the indeterminate/censored state did not differ significantly between the two 
groups (6.9% for physical activity vs. 6.1% for health education; P=.19). Results were 
similar for transitions to the indeterminate/censored state from No MMD (P=.18), MMD 
(P=.41) and Indeterminate/Censored (P=.60). For both physical activity and health 
education, censored observations represented a minority of the indeterminate/censored 
states, as shown in Appendix Table 1.

 The 6-month transition probabilities from No MMD and MMD for a 3-state model are 
provided in the first panel of Figure 2. The values are consistent with the percentages for the 
corresponding transitions in Table 1, with the physical activity group having a lower 
probability of transitioning from No MMD to MMD, relative to the health education group, 
but higher probabilities to transitioning from MMD to No MMD and death, respectively. In 
a series of interim models (Appendix Table 2), we found that the transition risks differed 
between the first year of follow-up and post-year one (P=.006), the associations between the 
intervention and transition risks did not differ between these two time periods (P=.50), and 
the transition risks were dependent on baseline age, sex and cardiovascular history (P<.001). 
In the final multi-state model, which accounted for these three considerations, the hazard 
ratios (95% CI) for comparisons of physical activity with health education were 0.87 (0.73–
1.03) for the transition from no MMD to MMD, 0.52 (0.10–2.67) for the transition from no 
MMD to death, 1.33 (0.99–1.77) for the transition from MMD to no MMD, and 1.92 (1.15–
3.20) for the transition from MMD to death. As shown in the second and third panels of 
Figure 2, the 6-month transition probabilities from this multi-state model were lower for 
transitions from no MMD to MMD in Year 1 than in subsequent years and for transitions 
from MMD to no MMD in subsequent years than in Year 1.
For the health education group, the cumulative incidence rates (95% CI) for no MMD to first 
MMD were 16.6% (14.1–19.2) and 28.3% (25.1–31.5) after 1 and 2 years of follow-up. The 
rates were considerably higher after only 1 year of follow-up for first MMD to first recovery 
(43.7% [36.8–50.4]) and first recovery to second MMD (62.0% [46.8–74.0]).
DISCUSSION
In an earlier report,(5) we demonstrated that the LIFE physical activity intervention, 
compared with the health education intervention, reduced the risk of initial MMD by 18% 
and the risk of persistent MMD, defined as two consecutive 6-month assessments with 
MMD, by 28%. The current study extends these earlier results by demonstrating that the 
physical activity intervention reduced the overall burden of (i.e. amount of time with) MMD 
over the entire 3.5-year follow-up period by 25%. This reduction was accomplished not only 
by decreasing the risk of initial MMD, as shown in the earlier report,(5) but also through 
enhanced recovery after an occurrence of MMD and a diminished risk of subsequent MMD 
episodes.
These new results enhance the clinical and public health relevance of the physical activity 
intervention. Unlike conditions that invariably progress, such as Alzheimer’s disease, 
mobility disability, especially in older persons, is a dynamic process, characterized by 
frequent transitions between states of independence and disability over time.(11) 
Interventions to promote independent mobility, therefore, should focus not only on 
preventing the initial occurrence of mobility disability but also on restoring and maintaining 
independent mobility in older persons who become disabled. Aside from acute disabling 
conditions, such as stroke or hip fracture, evidence supporting the benefit of interventions to 
facilitate recovery of independent mobility is relatively scant; and no prior study, to our 
knowledge, has demonstrated benefit of an intervention to maintain independent mobility 
after recovery from a disability episode.

 Although the physical activity intervention was associated with a 13% relative reduction in 
the rate of transitioning from no MMD to MMD (when considering only the prior state), the 
95% confidence interval spanned 1.0. A possible explanation for these results is that the 
physical activity intervention was more effective in reducing the initial occurrence of MMD 
than in reducing subsequent occurrences. Even if the relative reduction is diminished over 
time, the absolute reduction in MMD would likely be greater for the second versus first 
occurrence because the cumulative incidence rate was much higher for the second 
occurrence of MMD than the first. For similar reasons, the absolute benefit of physical 
activity may also be greater for facilitating recovery than preventing the initial occurrence of 
MMD, especially given the 33% relative increase in recovery. The behavioral strategies used 
to enhance return of participants to physical activity after an extended medical leave(14) 
may have been instrumental in promoting recovery after an intervening illness or injury.(18)
Surprisingly, the physical activity intervention was associated with an increased risk of death 
among participants with MMD. This association was not observed among participants 
without MMD. The reason for these discordant results is not clear. One possibility is that 
participants in the physical activity group who had MMD prior to death were more 
debilitated than their counterparts in the health education group, thereby placing them at 
higher risk of death. This might occur, for example, if the physical activity intervention was 
not effective in preventing the initial or subsequent occurrences of MMD or in promoting 
recovery from MMD among the most functionally limited participants. In subgroup 
analyses, however, we found that the intervention was at least as effective in reducing the 
burden of MMD among participants with SPPB scores <8 than those with higher scores. 
Moreover, in a post hoc analysis, we found that the SPPB score in the assessment prior to 
death was higher in the physical activity group (6.8) than health education group (5.3). A 
second possibility is that the physical activity intervention is not safe in a subset of 
participants with MMD. When we evaluated the cause of death among participants with 
MMD, we found that the proportion of cardiovascular deaths was higher in the health 
education group (7/21, 33%) than physical activity group (7/29, 24%), diminishing concerns 
about cardiovascular safety. A third possibility is that the increased risk of death was 
spurious or due to unaccounted factors that may have differentially changed between 
participants in the two treatment groups who developed MMD during the trial. For example, 
among participants with MMD, hospitalization for a serious illness or injury may have been 
more common in the physical activity group than the health education group, leading to an 
increased risk of death in the physical activity group.(19) Although randomization should 
protect against such a bias for the initial MMD transition, it would not do so for subsequent 
transitions, which occurred in a non-random subset of participants. Because the intention-to-
treat principle was maintained, the results for overall MMD burden should not be susceptible 
to this type of bias. Evaluating the role of intervening hospitalizations on the benefit of 
structured physical activity was beyond the scope of the current manuscript but will be the 
focus of a subsequent analysis.
Our study has other limitations. First, data on MMD were not available for about 7% of the 
follow-up assessments. This value did not differ appreciably between the two treatment 
groups, and the benefit of physical activity in reducing the burden of MMD was maintained 
using an array of different imputation assumptions for missing data. Second, prior to death,

 some nondisabled participants could have developed MMD that was not ascertained. When 
death was evaluated as MMD in a sensitivity analysis, the risk ratio for the overall burden of 
MMD did not change appreciably. Third, because the time between assessments was six 
months, some occurrences of MMD and MMD recovery may have been missed. Given the 
beneficial effects of the physical activity intervention, this would likely have resulted in 
conservative results for transitions from no MMD to MMD and from MMD to no MMD, 
respectively. Moreover, the results for MMD burden should not have been affected since 
prior work has shown that estimates of active and disabled life expectancy are not sensitive 
to the duration of the assessment interval.(20)
Our study had several strengths, including the large and racially diverse sample of 
vulnerable older persons from eight field centers spanning the US, the long duration of the 
interventions and follow-up, and excellent retention. In addition, adherence rates to the 
physical activity intervention were similar or higher than those achieved in other shorter 
studies involving older persons.(21) Finally, because fewer than 5% of age-eligible persons 
were excluded on the basis of an underlying medical condition, our results should be broadly 
applicable to our target population of sedentary older persons with functional limitations 
who do not already have major mobility disability.
Preserving community mobility is central to maintaining a high quality of life, including 
retention of many activities that are needed to be fully independent and engaged in the 
community. In addition, loss of community mobility is associated with multiple adverse 
outcomes, including worsening disability and morbidity, increases in health care utilization 
and costs, institutionalization, and death.(1–3, 22, 23) To enhance independent mobility, it is 
important not only to prevent the initial occurrence of disability, but also to restore and 
maintain independent mobility in older persons who become disabled. The current study 
provides strong evidence that the LIFE physical activity intervention reduced the overall 
burden of major mobility disability over an extended period of time, in part through 
enhanced recovery after an occurrence of disability and a diminished risk of subsequent 
disability episodes. These results highlight the long-term value of the LIFE physical activity 
intervention in promoting independent mobility among vulnerable older persons.

*Follow-up data were not available for 38 participants: 24 in the physical activity group and 14 in the health education group. A detailed description of these analyses is provided in the Appendix.
†As described in the Appendix, multiple imputation for the presence or absence of the binary outcomes (MMD or MMD/death) was performed using logistic regression, with baseline age, sex, SPPB score 
and clinical site as covariates, under five different assumptions:
MAR1: Allow the probability of MMD to be dependent on all prior MMD states (i.e. main effects for each previous visit-specific outcome variable) and the interaction between the proceeding two 
time points, where applicable. Terms for the intervention effect were not included in this model.
MAR2: Redefine the outcome as MMD or death. Repeat multiple imputation as described in MAR1.
MAR3: To the MAR1 model, add main effects for the intervention and interactions between the intervention effect and all prior outcomes.
MAR4: Redefine the outcome as MMD or death. Repeat multiple imputation as described in MAR3.
MNAR: Offset the predicted probabilities in the physical activity group from the MAR1 model so that the overall average prevalence of MMD was three times greater for the imputed assessments 
than the observed assessments (i.e. 12.5% for observed and 37.5% for imputed).
‡Percentage for imputed assessments averaged across 10 imputed datasets.
§For each imputed dataset, the total value was calculated by (1) taking the sum of the observed and imputed assessments with outcomes across all visits and dividing by the total number of visits; and (2) 
averaging the results across the 10 imputed data sets.
||Each risk ratio was obtained from a linear contrast as the average risk ratio across the follow-up visits. For the imputed results, the risk ratios were then averaged across the 10 datasets.
