SUMMARY
Stem cell-based approaches to cardiac regeneration
are increasingly viable strategies for treating heart
failure. Generating abundant and functional auto-
logous cells for transplantation in such a setting,
however, remains a significant challenge. Here, we
isolated a cell population with extensive proliferation
capacity and restricted cardiovascular differentiation
potentials
during
cardiac
transdifferentiation
of
mouse fibroblasts. These induced expandable car-
diovascular progenitor cells (ieCPCs) proliferated
extensively for more than 18 passages in chemically
defined conditions, with 105 starting fibroblasts
robustly producing 1016 ieCPCs. ieCPCs expressed
cardiac signature genes and readily differentiated
into functional cardiomyocytes (CMs), endothelial
cells
(ECs),
and
smooth
muscle
cells
(SMCs)
in vitro, even after long-term expansion. When trans-
planted into mouse hearts following myocardial
infarction, ieCPCs spontaneously differentiated into
CMs, ECs, and SMCs and improved cardiac function
for up to 12 weeks after transplantation. Thus,
ieCPCs are a powerful system to study cardiovascu-
lar specification and provide strategies for regenera-
tive medicine in the heart.
INTRODUCTION
Heart failure (HF) is a devastating disease and a major cause of
morbidity and mortality worldwide. HF often follows myocardial
infarction (MI) that is usually accompanied by a massive loss of
cardiomyocytes (CMs). These CMs cannot be regenerated by
the adult mammalian heart and cannot yet be replaced and/or re-
generated via cell-based therapies. Unfortunately, transplanting
CMs into an infarcted heart yields only transient and marginal
benefits (Burridge et al., 2012). Shortly after transplantation,
most CMs are soon lost. These effects are likely caused by the
limited proliferative capacity of fully differentiated CMs and a
lack of blood-vessel formation to supply oxygen and nutrients
(Lam et al., 2009). Thus, to create more effective regenerative
therapies, we need to find a cell type that can be extensively
expanded in vitro and robustly differentiated into cardiovascular
cells in a diseased heart.
Cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) may offer a promising
avenue for cardiac-regenerative therapy. These cells evolve from
the mesoderm during cardiogenesis, a well-orchestrated pro-
cess in developing embryos that is recapitulated in differenti-
ating pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). Patterned mesoderm gives
rise to a hierarchy of downstream cellular intermediates that
represent lineage-restricted CPCs for fully differentiated heart
cells, including CMs, endothelial cells (ECs), and smooth muscle
cells (SMCs) (Burridge et al., 2012). Each step in this hierarchy is
tightly controlled by multiple stage-specific signals (e.g., Wnt,
Activin/Nodal, bone morphogenetic protein [BMP], fibroblast
growth factor [FGF], and Notch) (Burridge et al., 2012; Bruneau,
2013). Additionally, the gradual loss of multipotency, or commit-
ment of cell fate, is usually accompanied by a decreased capac-
ity of cellular proliferation. Thus, by isolating CPCs that can
extensively self-renew and possess multiple, but restricted, po-
tentials to directly differentiate into these three cardiovascular
cell types, we may encourage the development of more effective
and potentially safer therapies for cardiac regeneration.
A previous study identified one type of primitive CPCs that ex-
press two key marker genes, MESP1 and SSEA1 (Cao et al.,
2013); however, these cells more closely represent a meso-
dermal precursor and are not fully committed to a cardiac fate.
To differentiate into CMs in vitro, these primitive CPCs require
multiple and sequential developmental signals. This notion is
supported by studies in which Mesp1+ cells not only contributed
to heart development but also gave rise to non-cardiovascular
mesodermal lineages, such as hematopoietic and skeletal mus-
cle cells (Chan et al., 2013; Devine et al., 2014). Consequently,
such properties of primitive CPCs may comprise their own ability
to efficiently differentiate and restore lost CMs within the
damaged heart, which lacks the complex paracrine environment
and tight temporal and spatial control seen in developing

 embryos. Several reports have also described more committed
CPCs that are fully specified to a cardiovascular fate. Such line-
age-restricted CPCs could be identified by several late-stage
marker genes, including insulin gene enhancer protein 1 (Isl1),
Nkx2-5, fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk-1; also known as vascular endo-
thelial growth factor [VEGF] receptor 2), and platelet-derived
growth factor receptor (PdgfR)-a (Moretti et al., 2006; Kattman
et al., 2011). These cells directly differentiated into three cardiac
lineages without stepwise developmental signals. For example,
Isl1+ cells have been observed in postnatal and adult heart and
enter fully differentiated cardiovascular lineages without the em-
bryonic heart niche (Laugwitz et al., 2005; Moretti et al., 2006).
Unfortunately, although these committed CPCs might be more
suitable for cardiac cell therapy in vivo, they have yet to be exten-
sively expanded, thus significantly limiting their applications.
To overcome these limitations, we systematically examined
combinations of multiple signaling pathways involved in cardio-
genesis and developed chemically defined conditions to identify
a specific type of CPCs—reprogrammed from fibroblasts—that
extensively self-renews and is restricted to a cardiovascular
fate (i.e., directly giving rise to CMs, ECs, and SMCs without
stepwise differentiation). These induced expandable CPCs
(ieCPCs) can robustly self-renew for more than 18 passages
(translated into >1016 ieCPCs from 105 starting fibroblasts) and
still retain their original morphology, gene expression pattern,
and multiple, but lineage-restricted, potentials to differentiate
into three cardiovascular lineages within the heart. Implanted
ieCPCs spontaneously differentiate into CMs, ECs, and SMCs
in infarcted mouse hearts and benefit heart function following
cardiac injury. With this system, similar expandable CPCs could
also be differentiated and captured from PSCs. This study pro-
vides a proof-of-principle demonstration that cardiovascular-
restricted CPCs that can self-renew long term in vitro can also
be directly induced from fibroblasts or differentiated from
PSCs. These cells offer a useful source, uncompromised by
growth arrest, for individualized cardiac cell therapies.
RESULTS
Hypothesis-Driven Screening to Capture ieCPCs
To develop effective and personalized cell therapies, we need to
obtain CPCs from an easily accessible source. To that end, we
used cell activation and signaling-directed (CASD) lineage con-
version, which transiently exposes cells to reprogramming fac-
tors and small molecules in conjunction with cardiac-inductive
signals (Efe et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2014). Remarkably, we
observed cell populations expressing markers corresponding
to different stages of cardiogenesis during reprogramming,
potentially helping identify and capture the desirable ieCPCs.
To capture and expand putative ieCPCs arising during CASD-
lineage conversion, we screened combinations of cardiogenic
signals with a functional assay under the hypothesis that ieCPCs
would respond and propagate with the right combination of
cardiogenic signaling at optimal strength. We performed the
conversion from secondary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (2nd
MEFs) (Efe et al., 2011). First, we activated the cells by transiently
expressing reprogramming factors for 6 days and allowed car-
diac specification for another 2 days. From day 8, we treated
the activated cells with various combinations of modulators of
Wnt, Activin/Nodal, BMP, FGF, VEGF, platelet-derived growth
factor (PDGF), and Notch pathways at different concentrations
for another 3 days and then passaged these cells three times un-
der the same conditions, each 4 days apart. We then assessed
spontaneous cardiac differentiation in cells that extensively
propagated without showing morphological changes over the
serial passages (Figure 1A). These cells were cultured in defined
basal differentiation conditions without serum, knockout serum
replacement, or any other exogenous differentiation cues, which
is a key criterion in evaluating the committed cardiovascular fate.
Cardiac differentiation of these cells was monitored by the pres-
ence of contractile patches and the expression of cardiac
troponin T (cTnT), a CM-specific marker. After repetitive testing
and optimizing, we converged on one promising condition that
retained the cardiac potential of induced cells after three pas-
sages, indicating that we captured putative ieCPCs. This condi-
tion contained BMP4 (5 ng/ml), Activin A (10 ng/ml), CHIR99021
(3 mM; a glycogen synthase kinase 3 inhibitor), and SU5402
(2 mM; an inhibitor of FGF, VEGF, and PDGF signaling), hereafter
referred to as BACS.
ieCPC Characterization
To characterize the molecular qualities of the putative ieCPCs,
we examined the expression of cardiac markers by qPCR.
Consistent with our hypothesis, a panel of transcription factors
known to be enriched in committed CPCs—Gata4, Mef2c,
Tbx5, and Nkx2-5—were highly expressed in the expanded cells
(Figure 1B), whereas differentiated CM markers—Tnnt2 and
Myh6—were barely detectable (data not shown). Interestingly,
Flk1 and Pdgfra, which encode the two CPC surface markers
Flk-1 and PdgfR-a, were also highly enriched in expanded
ieCPCs (Figure 1B). When expressed simultaneously, these
two markers characterize CPCs committed to a cardiovascular
lineage (Hirata et al., 2007; Kattman et al., 2011).
We then examined how cells responded to BACS treatment by
analyzing Flk-1 and PdgfR-a expression with fluorescence-acti-
vated cell sorting (FACS). Flk-1+/PdgfR-a+ cells first appeared at
day 8, responded to BACS treatment, and dominated the total
population (more than 70%) by 1 week later; however, without
BACS, these cells did not grow and eventually attenuated (Fig-
ures 1C and 1D). To distinguish whether the initial BACS treat-
ment increased Flk-1+/PdgfR-a+ cells through a mechanism of
induction and/or proliferation, we evaluated EdU incorporation
in transdifferentiating cells. We added EdU to the culture me-
dium with BACS at day 8 and examined the percentage of
EdU+/Flk-1+/PdgfR-a+ cells at day 14. We found that about
33% of Flk-1+/PdgfR-a+ cells did not incorporate EdU (Fig-
ure S1A), indicating that they were generated through direct in-
duction and not proliferation. To determine if proliferation is
needed to enrich Flk-1+/PdgfR-a+ cells, we treated the cells
with the cell-cycle inhibitor NU6140 (4 mM) along with BACS
starting on day 8. We found that the ratio of Flk-1+/PdgfR-a+ cells
dramatically decreased at day 14 (Figure S1B). These data
demonstrate that mechanisms of both cellular induction and pro-
liferation contribute to the generation of Flk-1+/PdgfR-a+ cells
during initial BACS treatment.
Next, we isolated the three subpopulations of cells (i.e.,
Flk-1+/PdgfR-a+, Flk-1�/PdgfR-a+, and Flk-1�/PdgfR-a�) on
day 13 by FACS and examined their cardiogenic potentials.

 We found that only Flk-1+/PdgfR-a+ cells efficiently gave rise to
cTnT+ CMs (Figures 1E, 1F, S1C, and S1D) and formed sponta-
neously beating clusters. Flk-1+/PdgfR-a+ cells that cultured for
two passages in BACS to recover from the initial sorting stress
showed more robust cardiac differentiation potential (Figure 1G).
These data demonstrate that Flk-1+/PdgfR-a+ cells, but not
other subpopulations, represent the putative ieCPCs in BACS-
treated cells.
ieCPCs Are Committed to a Cardiovascular Fate
We examined whether Flk-1+/PdgfR-a+ ieCPCs are truly com-
mitted cardiovascular precursors or more primitive CPCs that
require specific signals and steps to be further specified. We
found that treating ieCPCs with BMP4 significantly impaired their
cardiac differentiation; however, treating them with the Wnt in-
hibitor IWP2 (5 mM), which promotes CM specification only
from late-stage CPCs (Burridge et al., 2012), dramatically
enhanced their differentiation (Figures 1E, 1F, and S1E). Even
in basal differentiation conditions without any specific induction
signaling molecules, Flk-1+/PdgfR-a+ cells directly differentiated
into all three cardiovascular lineages, including CMs (cTnT+/car-
diac troponin I [cTnI]+), ECs (CD31+/VE-cadherin+), and SMCs
(a-smooth muscle actin [a-SMA]+/calponin+) (Figure 1H). These
distinct responses suggest that ieCPCs have already committed
to a cardiovascular fate. In addition, ieCPCs highly expressed
several committed CPC markers, including Gata4, Mef2c, Isl1,
and Nkx2-5, and the proliferative marker Ki-67 (Figure 1I);
whereas uncommitted mesoderm genes were only transiently
expressed at earlier stages during the generation of ieCPCs
(Figure S1F).
Next, we determined whether ieCPC differentiation was
restricted to a cardiovascular fate. We evaluated gene expres-
sion of mesoderm-derived non-cardiovascular lineages for
ieCPCs that underwent either CM-, EC-, and SMC-specific differ-
entiation or non-specific differentiation induced by fetal bovine
serum (FBS) for 10 days. Under these conditions, we found no
induction of non-cardiovascular genes, including markers of
hematopoietic precursors, skeletal muscles, adipocytes, and
chondrocytes (Figure S1G). To further confirm their restricted
cardiovascular potentials, we cultured ieCPCs in the well-estab-
lished induction conditions specified for each non-cardiovascu-
lar mesodermal lineage and compared the differentiation of
ieCPCs with mesodermal cells derived from mouse embryonic
stem cells (mESCs). In differentiated ieCPCs, we rarely found
any c-Kit+/CD45+ hematopoietic progenitors or more differenti-
ated c-Kit–/CD45+ hematopoietic cells, while mESC-derived
mesodermal cells well generated those hematopoietic cells (Fig-
ure S1H). Consistently, ieCPCs showed limited or no potential to
differentiate into myogenin+/MHC+ skeletal muscles, oil red O+
adipocytes, or alizarin red S+ chondrocytes compared with
mESC-derived mesodermal cells, even when exposed to each
lineage-specific induction cue (Figures S1I–S1K).
To more precisely characterize cells after ieCPC differentiation,
we analyzed the percentage of CMs (cTnT+), ECs (CD31+), and
SMCs (a-SMA+) by FACS in CM, EC, SMC, and FBS differentia-
tion conditions (Figure S2A). Isl1, a well-recognized CPC marker
that diminishes as soon as CPCs enter a differentiation program
(Moretti et al., 2006), was used to trace undifferentiated ieCPCs
(Figure S2B). We found that most (>93%) of the cells in each dif-
ferentiation condition were CMs, ECs, SMCs, or undifferentiated
ieCPCs (Figure S2C), confirming the restricted cardiovascular
potentials of ieCPCs. Notably, we did not observe CM generation
when ieCPCs were differentiated in FBS-containing conditions at
a low seeding density (1 3 104 cells/cm2, suitable for inducing
most mesodermal lineages) (Figures S1G and S2A). This defi-
ciency can be prevented by using the cell seeding density optimal
for CM differentiation (3 3 105 cells/cm2) and/or using BMP/Wnt
inhibitors (Figure S2D).
ieCPCs Can Be Expanded Long Term
We purified Flk-1+/PdgfR-a+ ieCPCs by FACS and tested
whether we could expand them in long-term culture. We found
that
purified
ieCPCs
showed
normal
undifferentiated
morphology and could stably propagate in BACS conditions
for more than 18 passages (>1010-fold expansion) (Figure 2A).
To evaluate whether ieCPCs expanded long term retain their
original properties, we compared ieCPCs of early (<5), middle
(5–10), and late (>10) passages. In these passages, we found
that ieCPCs maintained a high degree of similarity in growth
rate (Figure 2A), undifferentiated morphology (Figure 2B), and
expression of both Flk-1 and PdgfR-a (Figure 2C) over time. By
immunostaining, we found that ieCPCs similarly expressed
Gata4, Mef2c, Isl1, Nkx2-5, and Ki-67 at early, middle, and late
passages (Figures 2D, S3A, and S3B); however, they did not
express CM-, EC-, SMC- (Figures S3C–S3E), and pluripo-
tency-related markers (Figures S3F–S3I), even after long-term
expansion.
To determine if each component in BACS was required for
Flk-1+/PdgfR-a+ cells to self-renew, we omitted each cytokine
or chemical individually and evaluated cell expansion. We found
that omitting any component of BACS dramatically reduced the
percentage of Flk-1+/PdgfR-a+ cells (Figures 2E and 2F) and cell
proliferation (Figure 2G) within three passages, suggesting that
each component is indispensable. We also found that removing
each component of the BACS cocktail caused SMC, EC, or CM
marker genes to accumulate (Figure S3J), indicating that some
cells spontaneously differentiated. These results suggest that
each component of BACS synergistically represses cardiovas-
cular differentiation of ieCPCs to sustain their long-term self-
renewal.
To examine the global transcriptional profile of ieCPCs, we
compared the transcriptomes of early- and late-passage
ieCPCs, their parental MEFs, cells at day 9 of reprogramming
(D9), and cardiac derivatives from ieCPCs (ieCPC-CDs) by
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). With hierarchical cluster analyses,
we found that early- and late-passage ieCPCs had very similar
gene expression profiles that clearly differed from other cell pop-
ulations (Figure 3A). With Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, we found
that genes specifically expressed in ieCPCs were related to cell
adhesion
and
heart-lineage
commitment.
We
pairwise
compared ieCPCs with MEFs, D9, and ieCPC-CDs and found
that ieCPCs were mainly enriched with GO terms associated
with CPC fate and functions, such as heart development and
cell proliferation. Conversely, ieCPCs lacked GO terms involved
in functions of other cell types, such as the immune response in
MEFs, early embryonic development of germ layers in D9, and
myocyte contraction in ieCPC-CDs (Figures 3A, 3B, S4A, and
S4B). However, comparing early- and late-passage ieCPCs did

371
 not yield any GO terms that met the false discovery rate
threshold of %0.05, suggesting that ieCPCs retained stable tran-
scriptional signatures when expanded long term.
To determine whether ieCPCs represent a particular stage of
cardiac differentiation of ESCs, we compared them with cells
at different stages during cardiac differentiation of mESCs,
including undifferentiated ESCs, mesodermal cells, CPCs, and
differentiated CMs (Wamstad et al., 2012; Devine et al., 2014).
We found that ieCPCs and ESC-derived CPCs had the highest
transcriptional similarity compared with other reference cell
types (Figures 3C and S4C–S4E) and represented an intermedi-
ate cardiogenic population between uncommitted mesoderm
and terminally differentiated cardiovascular cells (Figure 3C).
Next, we evaluated a panel of well-studied genes involved in
CPC fate commitment. We found that ieCPCs highly expressed
CPC-related genes, including transcription factors, chromatin
remodelers, and cell-signaling molecules (Figure 3D). However,
they weakly expressed markers associated with other cell types,
including fibroblasts, early mesoderm, endoderm, ectoderm,
non-cardiovascular mesoderm, PSCs, epicardial cells, mesen-
chymal stem cells, and differentiated CMs, ECs, and SMCs (Fig-
ure S4F), with expression levels no higher than the ESC-derived
CPCs described by Wamstad et al. (2012) and Devine et al.
(2014). Collectively, these results demonstrate that ieCPCs
possess a global transcriptional pattern similar to that of normal
CPCs derived from ESCs.
Long-Term Expanded ieCPCs Exhibit Multi-lineage
Potentials for Cardiovascular Differentiation In Vitro
We tested whether ieCPCs retain their multi-lineage potentials
for cardiovascular differentiation when expanded long term.
We cultured ieCPCs at late passages in differentiation medium
supplemented with IWP2 (5 mM) and monitored their cardiac
differentiation daily for spontaneously contracting cells (typi-
cally observed first at day 3 of differentiation). The number of
beating cells gradually increased until day 10 and remained
at a similar level for more than 1 month. Cardiac differentiation
was robust, and synchronized beating sheets formed at day 10
(Movie S1). With immunostaining, we observed that CMs
derived from ieCPCs (ieCPC-CMs) expressed several CM-spe-
cific markers (Figure 4A). We also analyzed gene expression
by qPCR and detected many genes important for CM contrac-
tion and functional regulation (Figure 4B). FACS analysis of
cTnT revealed that the efficiency of CM differentiation from
ieCPCs was about 35% at day 10 (Figure 4C). Typically,
10,000 starting ieCPCs produced �30,000 total cells, from
which we estimate a yield of approximately one CM per input
ieCPC.

 Next, we further characterized ieCPC-CMs. By immunofluo-
rescence of the cardiac-myofilament proteins, we found that sin-
gle ieCPC-CMs displayed a well-organized sarcomeric structure
with clear cross-striations at day 10 (Figure 4D). We confirmed
this finding by transmission electron microscopy, in which the
well-organized sarcomeres, myofibrillar bundles, and transverse
Z bands were surrounded by ample mitochondria (Figure 4E). In
addition, intracellular electrical recordings from single beating
ieCPC-CMs at day 10 revealed robust action potentials (APs)
that were synchronized 1:1 with rhythmic Ca2+ transients (Fig-
ure 4F), which closely resembled CMs derived from murine fetal
hearts or PSCs (Kuzmenkin et al., 2009). On the basis of the ratio
of AP duration at 90% repolarization (APD90) to AP duration at
50% repolarization (APD50) (Kuzmenkin et al., 2009), we
detected nodal-like (20.0%), atrial-like (13.3%), and ventricu-
lar-like (66.7%) APs (Figures 4F and 4G). Moreover, 1 mM isopro-
terenol (a b-adrenergic agonist) significantly increased the
frequency of cell contraction and spontaneous Ca2+ transients.
These effects were blocked by 10 mM carbachol, a synthetic
muscarinic agonist, suggesting functional and coupled cas-
cades of b-adrenergic and muscarinic signaling in ieCPC-CMs
(Figure 4H). Moreover, 10 mM caffeine elicited large Ca2+
transients in ieCPC-CMs (Figure 4I), indicating the presence of
cardiac ryanodine receptors. Thus, the CMs generated from

 ieCPCs expanded long-term possess physiological features of
bona fide CMs and are functional in vitro.
To test whether ieCPCs expanded long term can give rise to
functional ECs in vitro, we examined EC gene expression after
10 days of EC differentiation. ECs generated from ieCPCs
(ieCPC-ECs) showed typical morphology and highly expressed
the EC-specific markers CD31 and VE-cadherin (Figure 5A).
FACS analysis revealed that more than 90% of the total cell pop-
ulation expressed CD31 (Figure 5B). Moreover, in contrast to the
parental MEFs, ieCPC-ECs could robustly form vessel-like struc-
tures (Figure 5C) and efficiently took up fluorescent-labeled
acetylated low-density lipoprotein (ac-LDL) (Figure 5D). These

 findings confirmed that ieCPC-ECs exhibited a similar pheno-
type and function to primary ECs (Kaufman et al., 2004).
To examine SMC differentiation, we analyzed the expression
of SMC-specific markers 10 days after SMC differentiation.
With immunofluorescence staining, we found that most cells
(>98%) were positive for the SMC-specific markers (Figure 5E).
Carbachol (100 mM) induced contraction of SMCs derived from
ieCPCs (ieCPC-SMCs), a phenomenon we also observed in pri-
mary SMCs but not undifferentiated ieCPCs (Figures 5F and 5G).
These findings suggest that ieCPC-SMCs have similar functional
properties to primary SMCs.
To determine whether ieCPCs are multipotent at a single-cell
level, we performed clonal assays on single ieCPCs and exam-
ined their potentials to differentiate into CMs, ECs, and SMCs.
After 28 days of differentiation, we found that 31.8% of the sin-
gle ieCPC-derived clones were tripotent, as demonstrated by
co-expression of CM, EC, and SMC genes (Figures S5A–
S5C). We also found that 22.7% of the clones were bipotent
and 45.5% of them were unipotent (Figures S5B and S5C), in
part because of the differentiation conditions and associated
efficiency.
ieCPCs Give Rise to CMs, ECs, and SMCs when
Transplanted into Mouse Hearts
After demonstrating that ieCPCs expanded long term undergo
cardiovascular differentiation in vitro, we extended the approach
to the native heart environment in vivo. We labeled ieCPCs at
passage 10 with red fluorescent protein (RFP) (Figure S6A) and
transplanted them into infarcted hearts of immunodeficient
mice. Parental MEFs served as a negative control. For each
mouse, 1 million ieCPCs or MEFs were directly injected into
the mouse heart immediately after coronary ligation. We sacri-
ficed recipient mice 2 weeks after transplantation and examined
the expression of markers for differentiated cardiovascular line-
ages. As expected, control MEFs did not express CM, EC, and
SMC markers (Figures S6B–S6D) and did not convert into car-
diovascular cells in the native cardiac niche. In striking contrast,
we detected RFP+ ieCPCs co-expressing cTnT and myosin (Fig-
ure 6A), CD31 and VE-cadherin (Figures 6B and 6C), or a-SMA
and calponin (Figures 6D and 6E) in grafts, indicating that ieCPCs
successfully converted into CMs, ECs, and SMCs, respectively,
in vivo. We also found RFP+ cells that were CD31+/VE-cadherin+
or a-SMA+/calponin+ in capillaries and arterioles, suggesting

 that the transplanted cells formed blood vessels, although at a
low frequency (Figures 6C and 6E). We found that 96 clusters
(30.8%) expressed CM marker cTnT, 184 clusters expressed
SMC marker a-SMA (59.2%), and 21 clusters expressed EC
marker CD31 (6.8%) in 311 engrafted RFP+ clusters, suggesting
that more than 90% of the engrafted ieCPCs efficiently differen-
tiated into three cardiovascular cell types after transplantation
(Figure S6E). Similar to our observation in vitro, we did not detect
non-cardiovascular-lineage markers in the grafted ieCPCs (Fig-
ures S6F–S6H). These results suggest that the in vivo environ-
ment of the infarcted mouse ventricle can trigger multi-lineage
cardiovascular differentiation of ieCPCs.
Intramyocardial Transplantation of ieCPCs Retards
Adverse Remodeling and Improves Heart Outcome
after MI
To determine whether the transplantation of ieCPCs could affect
cardiac function following cardiac injury, we examined heart
function via high-resolution echocardiography over the course
of 12 weeks after injecting cells into immunodeficient mice sub-
jected to coronary ligation. All studies were performed in a
blinded fashion and were revealed only at the end of the exper-
iments. We found that heart function in the control group, in-
jected with parental 2nd MEFs, continued to decline over time,
reflected by left ventricular fractional shortening and ejection
fraction evaluated by echocardiography (Figures 6F and 6G).
Strikingly, we found that the natural reduction of heart perfor-
mance post-MI was significantly attenuated after transplantation
of ieCPCs compared with control, and these differences became
more pronounced over time (Figures 6F and 6G). Furthermore,
we observed significantly smaller scar size in mice transplanted
with ieCPCs 12 weeks post-MI (Figures 6H–6J). Adverse remod-
eling, such as dilation and compensatory hypertrophy that are
part of the natural course of events after MI, was also reduced
in mouse hearts that received ieCPCs (Figures 6I and 6K). More-
over, we did not observe the formation of teratomas in ieCPC-
transplanted mice 8 weeks after transplantation (Figures S6I
and S6J). These observations suggest that transplantation of
ieCPCs improves cardiac function after acute ischemic myocar-
dial injury.
ieCPCs Can Be Derived from Tail-Tip Fibroblasts
To determine whether ieCPCs could be reprogrammed from
other types of fibroblasts that are genetically unmodified, we iso-
lated mouse tail-tip fibroblasts (TTFs) and infected them with
lentivirus harboring a doxycycline-inducible transgene encoding
the reprogramming factors. Under the same conditions as used
for 2nd MEFs, a similar Flk-1+/PdgfR-a+ population was induced
from TTFs after BACS treatment. After FACS sorting, these
Flk-1+/PdgfR-a+
cells
showed
normal
undifferentiated
morphology (Figure S7A), sustained expression of CPC and pro-
liferative markers (Figures S7B and S7C), and steadily expanded
in BACS for more than 12 passages. When cultured in the differ-
entiation conditions of 2nd MEF-derived ieCPCs, TTF-derived
ieCPCs rapidly differentiated into all three cardiovascular line-
ages with comparable efficiencies (Figures S7D and S7E; Movie
S2). These results suggest that fibroblasts from different tissues
of origin can be stably reprogrammed into multipotent ieCPCs,
independent of the transgenic system.
BACS Captures and Expands CPCs Derived from PSCs
Next, we evaluated whether ieCPCs could be captured during
cardiac differentiation of PSCs (Kattman et al., 2011; Burridge
et al., 2012), which represents embryonic cardiac development.
Upon cardiac differentiation of mESCs, we observed Flk-1+/
PdgfR-a+ CPCs at day 3 of differentiation. We isolated this
population by FACS and cultured it in ieCPC-expansion me-
dium supplemented with BACS. Similar to what were observed
in
fibroblast-derived
ieCPCs,
the
Flk-1+/PdgfR-a+
CPCs
derived from mESCs showed similar morphology (Figure 7A),
expressed CPC and proliferative markers (Figures 7B and
7C), robustly expanded in BACS for more than 12 passages,
and differentiated into all three cardiovascular lineages with
similar efficiencies as fibroblast-derived ieCPCs when stimu-
lated (Figures 7D and 7E; Movie S3). In addition, ieCPCs
and
mESC-derived
CPCs

BACS
had
very
similar

expression
profiles,
exhibiting
CPC-specific
gene signatures (Figure 7F). These results demonstrate that
ieCPCs that appear during the cardiac transdifferentiation of fi-
broblasts also exist during normal cardiac differentiation of
mESCs.
DISCUSSION
Despite the prospects of cell-based therapies to regenerate
damaged heart tissue, a cardiac-restricted cell type is needed
that
allows
autologous
transplantation,
can
be
robustly
expanded in vitro, and can be rapidly and directly differentiated
into cardiovascular cells in vivo. Unfortunately, this discovery is
remarkably challenging to accomplish. Here, we identified and
captured a cardiovascular-restricted, yet highly expandable,
progenitor cell type reprogrammed from fibroblasts. These
ieCPCs can self-renew long term and directly differentiate into
the three major cardiovascular lineages within the adult heart
without being sequentially induced with embryonic cardiogenic
signals.
A distinct feature of ieCPCs is their extensive proliferative ca-
pacity. Terminally differentiated CMs usually stop proliferating
and survive poorly after transplantation, which inhibits their abil-
ity to repopulate and replenish a diseased heart (Lam et al.,
2009). Although previous studies have identified various types
of CPCs that proliferate, they only transiently expanded (e.g.,
1 week) and displayed a limited capacity to replicate (<100 pop-
ulation doublings) (Moretti et al., 2006; Qyang et al., 2007). More-
over, many undefined components used in these systems, such
as feeder cells and high-level serum, may hamper their applica-
tion. Of note, a recent publication reported the efficient propaga-
tion of PSC-derived CPCs (�107-fold expansion) by combining
chemical and genetic manipulation (Birket et al., 2015). This sys-
tem required exogenous expression of the oncogenic transgene
MYC for the self-renewal of CPCs, which limits the translational
applicability of these cells. In contrast, the ieCPCs we describe
here can be propagated long term (>18 passages) in chemically
defined conditions (>1010-fold expansion) without foreign trans-
genes (Figure 2A).
Moreover, expanded ieCPCs directly differentiate into three
cardiovascular lineages required for heart regeneration, which
will provide not only a more efficient starting point for regener-
ative medicine but also a powerful platform to dissect the onset

 of cardiac development. Currently, we do not know if the car-
diovascular derivatives of ieCPCs originated from a homoge-
neous population or, alternatively, diverse subpopulations
within ieCPCs. Because ieCPCs can robustly differentiate into
each cardiovascular lineage (�35% for CMs and >90% for
SMCs and ECs) in vitro, we speculate that each lineage is
less likely to be generated from a distinct subtype of ieCPCs.
Clonal assays of single ieCPCs showed that at least a fraction
of ieCPCs are multipotent and serve as a common cardiovas-
cular precursor for the three main lineages of the developing
heart. Of note, a portion of residual, undifferentiated progeni-
tors was observed when ieCPCs were induced to differentiate
in various conditions within the time frame (Figure S2B). This
result is consistent with many other systems in which stem
cell and precursor differentiation is usually unsynchronized
and can hardly achieve 100% differentiation efficiency. In
most cases, the differentiated populations are a mixture that
contains both undifferentiated stem cells and their derivatives
with a ratio that depends on the differentiation contexts (Murry
and Keller, 2008). In the SMC and EC differentiation conditions,
as well as in the local environment of injured hearts, ieCPCs
differentiated
in
a
more
synchronized
manner,
achieving
>90% efficiency. Given that the field of stem cell differentiation
has experienced rapid growth in knowledge and technical ad-
vances, developing more robust and uniform systems for
ieCPC differentiation will be of great interest and may be within
the reach.
Significantly, ieCPCs have a more restricted cardiovascular
fate than previously reported CPCs, which seem less differenti-
ated and depend on multiple sequential steps or signals to
further differentiate into CMs (Blin et al., 2010; Cao et al.,
2013). The ieCPCs express genes of committed CPCs, but not
of early mesoderm or other lineages. They respond to late- but
not early-stage cardiogenic signals and directly give rise to
beating CMs in a single step within 3 days in vitro. Additionally,
they show very limited potential to differentiate into non-cardio-
vascular derivatives of the mesoderm, even when induced with
specific cues. Furthermore, when exposed to the infarcted heart
environment in vivo, they can directly generate CMs, ECs, and
SMCs, but not non-cardiovascular mesodermal derivatives.
Because the adult heart lacks the complex signals of embryonic
cardiogenesis, these features may make ieCPCs a promising cell
source for in vivo applications.
Indeed, we found that transplantation of ieCPCs into mouse
infarcted
hearts
provides
long-term
functional
benefits
(3 months), in contrast to transplantation of CMs that only tran-
siently improve cardiac performance (<1 month) (van Laake
et al., 2007). This improvement may result from ieCPCs gener-
ating de novo CMs to facilitate and restore heart contractility
and contributing to blood-vessel formation that supplies oxygen
and nutrients to increase graft survival and integration into sur-
rounding tissues (Lam et al., 2009), thereby sustaining long-
term functional improvement after cardiac injury. In addition,
the beneficial effects of ieCPC transplantation may partially
result from paracrine mechanisms. Further studies are needed
to better understand the therapeutic mechanisms that occur
after ieCPC transplantation and to enhance the engraftment of
ieCPCs.
With global transcriptome analysis by RNA-seq, we found high
similarities between ieCPCs and CPCs derived from mESCs.
Moreover, we could capture ESC-derived CPCs and propagate
them long term in BACS conditions; ESC-derived CPCs
expanded in BACS possess very similar differentiation capacity
to ieCPCs, generating three cardiovascular lineages with equal
efficiencies. These results suggest that although ieCPCs can
be derived via cardiac transdifferentiation of fibroblasts, they
can also exist during embryonic cardiogenesis. Interestingly,
ieCPCs co-express multiple CPC markers detected at both early
(i.e., Flk-1 and PdgfR-a) and late (i.e., Isl1, Gata4, and Mef2c)
stages of normal cardiac development and differentiation. This
expression pattern is stable when ieCPCs are expanded long
term in vitro, regardless of their origin (i.e., 2nd MEFs, TTFs, or
PSCs). This phenomenon is also observed in some native CPC
populations in developing hearts or differentiated from PSCs
(Figure 3D) (Moretti et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2008), suggesting
that there may not be a sharp distinction in expression of those
selected genes between these stages and some overlap may
exist.
In this study, we identified BACS as a robust condition for the
efficient generation and long-term renewal of ieCPCs. BMP,
Activin A, and Wnt are key signaling molecules that synergisti-
cally induce mesoderm and subsequent CPC formation (Yang
et al., 2008; Kattman et al., 2011). Particularly, Wnt signaling
plays a biphasic role in cardiogenesis (i.e., it stimulates meso-
derm induction from early stem cells but inhibits CM differentia-
tion of late-stage CPCs) (Naito et al., 2006; Burridge et al., 2012).
In addition, VEGF, PDGF, and FGF signals induce further differ-
entiation of CPCs (Kattman et al., 2011; Cheung et al., 2012). As
a chemical inhibitor of these pathways by targeting their recep-
tors, SU5402 may block further differentiation of ieCPCs.
Because BACS contains BMP4, Activin A, and CHIR99021 (a
Wnt agonist), it is therefore consistent with what have been
mechanistically characterized for these signaling that those re-
programming cells treated with BACS are induced or patterned
into mesoderm and CPCs, and, initially, one third of the Flk-1+/
PdgfR-a+ cells are directly induced by BACS without replication

 (Figure S1A). In addition, we also confirmed that the generated
ieCPCs can self-renew/expand under the BACS condition, and
this expansion step contributes to the rapid enrichment of
Flk-1+/PdgfR-a+ cells. Thus, we concluded that mechanisms of
both cellular induction and proliferation contribute to the initial
generation of Flk-1+/PdgfR-a+ cells after BACS treatment. After
initial generation of ieCPCs, BACS also support long-term self-
renewal and proliferation of ieCPCs by synergistically repressing
further differentiation. Given that early embryonic cardiogenesis
is similar between mice and humans, with CPCs in both species
expressing the same key markers (i.e., Flk-1 and PdgfR-a)
and responding to similar developmental cues (Kattman et al.,
2011), our results may have implications in reprogramming and
expanding human ieCPCs for various applications.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
CASD System-Based Cardiac Reprogramming
Reprogramming of 2nd MEFs was initiated by seeding cells onto Geltrex
(GIBCO)-coated plates in MEF medium. Doxycycline (2 mg/ml; Sigma) was
added 1 day later. The next day, cells were cultured in reprogramming medium
for 6 days with doxycycline and 0.5 mM JI1 (Millipore). On day 6, medium
was changed to transdifferentiation medium containing 3 mM CHIR99021
(Stemgent) and 0.5 mM JI1. On day 8, medium was switched to ieCPC basal
medium supplemented with BACS (5 ng/ml BMP4, 10 ng/ml Activin A, 3 mM
CHIR99021, and 2 mM SU5402 [Tocris]) and 0.5 mM JI1. Medium was renewed
every 2 days until cells were sorted on day 13.
Long-Term Expansion of ieCPCs
Flk-1+/PdgfR-a+ cells were purified by FACS and seeded onto Geltrex-coated
plates in ieCPC basal medium supplemented with BACS and 250 mM ascorbic

 acid (Sigma). ieCPCs were routinely passaged every 4 days, and medium was
renewed every 2 days.
ieCPC Differentiation
For the generation of CMs, ieCPCs were seeded onto Matrigel-coated plates
at a density of 3 3 105 cells/cm2 and kept in serum-free differentiation (SFD)
medium for 10 days. In some experiments, 5 mM IWP2 was included during
the first 6 days to increase the yield of CMs. For the generation of SMCs
and ECs, ieCPCs were seeded onto Matrigel-coated plates at a density of
1 3 104 cells/cm2 and cultured in SFD medium supplemented with 2 ng/ml
TGF-b1 and 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB (for SMCs) or in EGM-2 medium (Lonza) (for
ECs) for 10 days.
Cell Transplantation
In cell transplantation studies, a mouse MI model was induced by permanent
ligation of the left anterior descending artery. One million donor cells were in-
jected along the boundary between the infarct and border zones. All mouse
work was conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical significance of differences was estimated by Student’s t test in
Microsoft Excel. p < 0.05 was regarded as indicating statistical significance.
