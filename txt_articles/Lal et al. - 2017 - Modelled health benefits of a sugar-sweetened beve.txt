Abstract
Background
A sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) tax in Mexico has been effective in reducing consump-
tion of SSBs, with larger decreases for low-income households. The health and financial
effects across socioeconomic groups are important considerations for policy-makers. From
a societal perspective, we assessed the potential cost-effectiveness, health gains, and
financial impacts by socioeconomic position (SEP) of a 20% SSB tax for Australia.
Methods and findings
Australia-specific price elasticities were used to predict decreases in SSB consumption for
each Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) quintile. Changes in body mass index
(BMI) were based on SSB consumption, BMI from the Australian Health Survey 2011–12,
and energy balance equations. Markov cohort models were used to estimate the health
impact for the Australian population, taking into account obesity-related diseases. Health-
adjusted life years (HALYs) gained, healthcare costs saved, and out-of-pocket costs were
estimated for each SEIFA quintile. Loss of economic welfare was calculated as the amount
of deadweight loss in excess of taxation revenue. A 20% SSB tax would lead to HALY gains
of 175,300 (95% CI: 68,700; 277,800) and healthcare cost savings of AU$1,733 million (m)
(95% CI: $650m; $2,744m) over the lifetime of the population, with 49.5% of the total health
gains accruing to the 2 lowest quintiles. We estimated the increase in annual expenditure on
SSBs to be AU$35.40/capita (0.54% of expenditure on food and non-alcoholic drinks) in the
lowest SEIFA quintile, a difference of AU$3.80/capita (0.32%) compared to the highest quin-
tile. Annual tax revenue was estimated at AU$642.9m (95% CI: $348.2m; $1,117.2m). The
main limitations of this study, as with all simulation models, is that the results represent only
the best estimate of a potential effect in the absence of stronger direct evidence.

 Conclusions
This study demonstrates that from a 20% tax on SSBs, the most HALYs gained and health-
care costs saved would accrue to the most disadvantaged quintiles in Australia. Whilst
those in more disadvantaged areas would pay more SSB tax, the difference between areas
is small. The equity of the tax could be further improved if the tax revenue were used to fund
initiatives benefiting those with greater disadvantage.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Previous real-world evaluations of a sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) tax showed that
the SSB tax led to a reduction of SSB purchases for the total population, with larger
effects for lower-income households.
• It was unknown what the healthcare cost savings, health gains, and financial impacts of
an SSB tax would be for different income groups, in Australia or internationally.
What did the researchers do and find?
• We modelled the effect of a 20% SSB tax in Australia on life expectancy and health-
adjusted life years before and after implementation of the tax, across quintiles of area-
level socioeconomic deprivation.
• Our model predicts that the greatest health gains would accrue to the 2 lowest quintiles
(most disadvantaged), leading to the highest healthcare cost savings in these quintiles.
• We estimate the increase in annual expenditure on SSBs to be AU$35 per capita in the
lowest quintile, a difference of less than $5 compared to the highest quintile.
• Annual tax revenue was estimated at over AU$640 million.
What do these findings mean?
• A 20% SSB tax in Australia is likely to decrease SSB purchase and consumption, leading
to significant health gains and healthcare expenditure savings across all quintiles of
socioeconomic deprivation.
• The tax would generate considerable yearly revenue, which the government could use to
further improve the health of the most disadvantaged.
• As with all simulation models, the model results represent the best estimate of a poten-
tial effect in the absence of stronger direct evidence.

 Introduction
In high-income countries, obesity is more common in the most disadvantaged groups [1].
Reducing inequalities in health between advantaged and disadvantaged groups is an important
objective of public health policy [2]. The evidence of the association between sugar-sweetened
beverage (SSB) intake and increased energy intake, leading to weight gain and obesity, is com-
pelling [3,4]. Obesity is a strong risk factor for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, some cancers,
osteoarthritis, and hypertension [5–7]. Individuals from lower socioeconomic groups have
been found to consume more SSBs [8,9]. The prevalence of obesity-related comorbidities is
also higher in lower socioeconomic groups.
A tax on SSBs is considered to be an important component of the set of recommended pol-
icy approaches to address population obesity [10–12]. Price influences SSB purchase [13],
which in turn may reduce the rate of obesity [14]. There is an economic rationale for taxes
when consumption results in negative externalities. In Australia, the diseases caused by obesity
were estimated to cost tax payers AU$5.3 billion in healthcare costs, forgone tax, and welfare
payments in 2014/2015 [15]. The economic rationale for an SSB tax essentially rests on the
notion of ‘internalising the externality’ within the purchase price.
There is evidence that people with lower incomes are more sensitive to price increases [16]
and are therefore more likely to change their purchasing behaviour in response to price
changes. In Mexico, an evaluation of an SSB tax of approximately 10% introduced in 2014
showed a reduction in purchases of taxed beverages for the total population, with an even
larger effect for lower-income households [17,18].
The financial impact of an SSB tax for different socioeconomic position (SEP) groups has
been examined in terms of the predicted tax burden to individuals and households. A recent
systematic review describing the financial burden of an SSB tax across different SEP groups
identified 5 studies, which found that the tax would be financially regressive, but with small
differences of approximately US$5 between high- and low-income households; the average
additional tax paid per household as a result of the SSB tax would be less than US$30 annually
across all groups [19]. Previous Australian research has predicted that an SSB tax would lead to
cost savings in the health sector [20,21]. But the effect on overall healthcare cost savings and
the health gains in health-adjusted life years (HALYs) across SEP groups have rarely been pre-
viously examined. The overall financial impact on individuals includes the potential healthcare
costs saved by individuals, and this also has seldom been previously estimated across SEP
groups. A rate of 20% is the most commonly advocated tax by public health experts [22]. South
Africa and the UK have recently proposed taxes of this magnitude [23]. The main aim of this
paper, therefore, is to examine the health and financial impacts of a 20% SSB sales tax for Aus-
tralia across socioeconomic groups by comprehensively integrating distributional aspects into
the cost-effectiveness analysis.
This study expands on previous studies in a number of ways. First, the cost-effectiveness
of a 20% SSB tax for Australia by SEP subgroup was estimated, including a wide range
of SSBs and substitute beverages, with a focus on the quantity and distribution of health
gains in HALYs according to an area-based measure of socioeconomic disadvantage,
Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA). Second, the distribution of financial impacts to
individuals across different SEP groups was examined, in terms of out-of-pocket costs
incurred from the tax and healthcare costs saved. Third, the overall economic impact of the
tax was examined in terms of the balance of effects for the health sector and the general
economy.

 Methods
Specification of the tax
A 20% sales tax on SSBs in Australia was modelled. SSBs included soft drinks (pop, soda); fla-
voured water; sports, energy, and fruit drinks; and cordials (concentrates) containing added
sugar. It was assumed that the full amount of the tax would be passed on to the consumer.
Overview
The model estimated the differences in life expectancy and HALYs pre- and post- implementa-
tion of the tax. These differences were based on predicted variations in 9 diseases caused by
obesity. Changes to body mass index (BMI) were modelled based on projected changes in SSB
consumption.
The Australian population aged 2–100 years was modelled over a lifetime, with covariates
based on the Australian Health Survey (AHS) 2011–12 [24] and disease epidemiology based
on a study of the US burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors in 2010 [25]. The analysis has
2 parts: (1) a whole population analysis and (2) analyses by SEIFA quintile. Fig 1 illustrates the
logic pathway of an SSB tax, identifying the steps involved in measuring the expected impact
of the tax from an obesity perspective.
Assessment of benefit
Effect of the tax on body weight.
For the whole population analysis, baseline intake of
drinks was based on data from the AHS 2011–12 [24]. Dietary data were collected based on
24-hour dietary recall on 2 separate days. Mean daily intake of each category of SSB and substi-
tutes of tea, coffee, milk, and 100% fruit juice were extracted from the survey using Stata 14
[26]. Mean intake was calculated by sex, in 5-year age groups.
For the SEP subgroup analyses, individuals in the survey were categorised by SEIFA Index
of Relative Socio-Economic Disadvantage (IRSD) deciles, which were converted to quintiles.
The SEIFA quintiles represent groups of individuals who live in similarly ranked areas, based
on a range of information such as the income, qualifications, and occupation skills of the area
residents [27]. Mean SSB intake for the quintiles was not extracted by age group as the groups
were too small. However, an age multiplier was applied based on proportions of intake by age
from the total population (see S1 Table for mean intake).
The change in intake of SSBs associated with a 20% tax was based on an Australian study
that derived own-price elasticities and cross-price elasticities from Australian household
supermarket purchases and a mathematical demand system model [28]. Own-price elasticities
represent the proportional change in SSB purchases in response to a change in SSB price.
Cross-price elasticities represent the proportional change in purchases of other substitute
drinks (such as coffee) in response to a change in SSB price. We applied the price elasticities
derived for the low- and high-income households, respectively, to the consumption of SSBs in
the lowest and highest SEIFA quintile [28]. The price elasticities for the middle-income house-
holds were applied to SEIFA quintile 3. The price elasticities for quintiles 2 and 4 were interpo-
lated using linear trends estimation from quintiles 1, 3, and 5 in Excel (see S2 Table). The
reductions in quantities of SSBs consumed and increases in substitute drinks consumed were
converted to kilojoule equivalents using nutrient tables for Australia (NUTTAB, 2010) [29].
Estimated changes in body weight for adults were calculated based on published relation-
ships between changes in energy expenditure and body weight at the population level. Changes
in body weight for adults were based on a change of 100 kilojoules per day equalling a 1-kg
change in weight, taking 3 years to achieve the total weight change [30]. The following

 formulas were used for children [31]:
Boys : kilojoules per day per kilogram ¼ 68 � 2:5 � age � 4:184
ð1Þ
Girls : kilojoules per day per kilogram ¼ 62 � 2:2 � age � 4:184
ð2Þ
These changes in weight were converted to changes in BMI using average Australian height
and weight by gender and single-year age groups up to 19 years and 5-year age groups thereaf-
ter from the AHS 2011–12 [24].
Modelling health outcomes.
We used a recently developed model (CRE-Obesity model)
to estimate how a change in the distribution of the prevalence of overweight and obesity
caused by an intervention impacts the epidemiology of several obesity-related diseases, which
in turn influence the total HALYs in the population. This model was based on the Assessing
Cost-Effectiveness in Prevention (ACE-Prevention) obesity model [32,33], which has previ-
ously been used to model the cost-effectiveness of several obesity interventions [34–36]. We
extended the model by considering the incremental costs and benefits by SEIFA quintile, as
well as by including children and adolescents.
The model uses a multi-state, multiple cohort life table approach to translate changes in
mean BMI following an intervention into corresponding HALYs gained. Potential impact frac-
tions were used to quantify the proportional reduction in disease incidence that would occur if
a population were subject to a counterfactual exposure to a risk factor because of an interven-
tion [37]. Disease-specific mortality and morbidity were then combined with all other causes
of mortality and morbidity from the population to estimate the total morbidity and mortality
in the total population. The diseases were diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, stroke,
hypertensive heart disease, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, endometrial cancer, kidney cancer,
and osteoarthritis of the knee and hip.
The CRE-Obesity model calculates incremental HALYs, incremental costs, and cost-effec-
tiveness ratios. Using the SEIFA IRSD, we created quintile-specific sub-models by substituting
key input parameters with SEIFA-quintile-specific data. These parameters included disease
incidence [38–40], mortality rate [41], BMI distribution [42], and population number [43].
We modelled the SSB tax on SEIFA groups as a population-based intervention—that is, the

 lifetime health and cost effects from the tax altered the distribution of BMI among all ages (2–
100 years). For individuals aged 2–19 years, who were not modelled as experiencing the
included diseases, the disability related to obesity itself was quantified, using the health-related
quality of life lost due to obesity before and after the intervention, based on the difference
between quality-adjusted life year (QALY) weights [44]. Thus, HALYs gained due to an inter-
vention represent the number of years lived in full health gained, adjusted for morbidity of
obesity-related diseases, and obesity as a whole in the population aged less than 20 years.
Assessment of costs
Intervention costs. Intervention costs were assessed from both a government and indus-
try perspective over the lifetime of the population. In the absence of Australian data on the
administration and compliance costs of implementing a soft drink tax, costing methods from
a US study of 2 states operating an excise tax were converted to the equivalent Australian costs
[45]. Estimates of legislation costs of tobacco plain packaging in terms of establishment, imple-
mentation, ongoing compliance, and administration costs for the Australian Department of
Health, at AU$12.69 million (m) over 10 years, were used as a benchmark [46]. Administration
costs to the beverage industry were assumed to be equal to the costs to government, based on
sales tax evidence in the US [47].
A framework for costing new public health legislation was used to estimate the cost of pass-
ing legislation in the Australian parliament [47], with slight adjustments for the Australian
context. Briefly, it includes parliamentarians’ time, annual expenses for the House of Represen-
tatives and the Senate, legislation drafting, and publication and policy advice. As we could not
identify costs for policy advice in Australia, we used the equivalent Australian dollar costs
from New Zealand (NZ) (see S3 Table).
Healthcare costs. Treatment costs were based on Disease Costs and Impact Study (DCIS)
2001 data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) [48], inflated to 2010
prices using AIHW health price inflation values [49]. Costs included hospital services, out-of-
hospital medical services, pharmaceuticals, and health professionals. Healthcare expenditures
saved were estimated based on the predicted reduction in mortality and morbidity from the 9
diseases.
Out-of-pocket healthcare costs. Out-of-pocket healthcare costs are healthcare costs paid
for by individuals and include pharmaceuticals, medical services, practitioners, aids and appli-
ances, and hospital costs. Out-of-pocket healthcare costs by SEIFA quintile were based on the
percentage of individuals’ overall expenditure used for total healthcare expenditure, reported
by the AIHW in 2010 as 17.4% [49]. Proportions of mean household annual healthcare expen-
diture and total household expenditure, together with ‘equivalised’ disposable income by quin-
tile from the Australian Bureau of Statistics Household Expenditure Survey 2010 [50], were
used to calculate quintile-specific out-of-pocket healthcare costs as a percentage of overall
expenditure. Equivalisation is a technique in economics whereby members of a household
receive different weightings. Total household income is then divided by the sum of the weight-
ings to yield a representative income.
Deadweight loss (loss in economic welfare).
Deadweight loss (DWL) is an economic
term used to describe the net loss in total economic welfare that can be attributed to the intro-
duction of a new tax or tax increase. The tax drives a price increase that leads to a fall in
demand; this in turn involves reduced benefits flowing to both consumers and producers. As a
result, there is a reduction in both consumer surplus (the difference between the value a con-
sumer places on a product and the price paid) and producer surplus (the price minus the eco-
nomic cost of producing the product) (refer to S1 Fig for additional detail). This loss in

 economic welfare is calculated for each SSB category for each quintile and for the population
using the following formula:
DWL ¼ 0:5 � ðP2—P1Þ � ðQ1—Q2Þ
ð3Þ
where P1 is the original price of the SSBs, P2 is the new price of the SSBs, Q1 is the original
quantity demanded of the SSBs, and Q2 is the new quantity demanded of the SSBs.
The total loss of economic welfare is thus the amount of DWL in excess of the taxation reve-
nue collected by the government. There are also behavioural responses associated with these
inherently dynamic impacts that are not fully captured in this formula—desirably, industry
realigns to healthier products, consumers realign to healthier purchases, and the tax revenue
can be utilised for welfare-enhancing initiatives.
Out-of-pocket tax costs. Predicted tax paid per person due to the introduction of a 20%
SSB tax was calculated as the post-tax mean quantity demanded of each category of SSB con-
sumed multiplied by 20% of the current retail price. This assumes that the full burden of the
tax is borne by the consumer. We used prices sourced from a large Australian supermarket
website (Coles; http://www.colesonline.com.au). An average price per litre was taken from a
range of sizes and brands. Mean annual expenditure on food and non-alcoholic drinks by
‘equivalised’ disposable income quintile from the Australian Household Expenditure Survey
2010 [50] was used to calculate percentage of annual expenditure on food and non-alcoholic
drinks.
Tax revenue. The tax revenue predicted to be received by the government was calculated
by multiplying the per person out-of-pocket tax cost by the number of people in each popula-
tion group.
Cost-effectiveness analysis
Table 1 outlines the general methodology of the economic evaluation. The intervention was
assumed to be operating in ‘steady state’ (i.e., running at its full effectiveness potential) and
was measured against current practice. Establishment costs were included in the cost of the
intervention. The additional costs and the associated health benefits (HALYs) resulting from

 the tax were used to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), defined as the dif-
ference in net costs of the tax compared to no tax, divided by the difference in net HALYs.
Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis
The impact of uncertainty around input values on the main outcome measures was estimated
by Monte Carlo simulations (Table 2). Means and 95% confidence intervals for BMI effects on
HALYs and intervention costs were reported based on 2,000 iterations using Ersatz version 1.3
software [52].
We performed several sensitivity analyses. We performed one-way sensitivity analyses to
explore the effect of including flavoured milk in the SSBs. As the price elasticity for flavoured
milk was not available, we assumed the same price elasticity as for soft drinks. We also tested
an SSB tax rate of 30% and a 50% pass-through of the 20% tax. Another mechanism for imple-
menting a tax—a 50¢ per litre volumetric tax was also tested. This is in line with alcoholic bev-
erages in Australia, which are taxed per litre of alcohol. A tax of 50¢ per litre is an average 17%
increase in price across all SSB categories.
Health equity analysis
A concentration index quantifies the degree of socioeconomic inequality in a specific health
variable. Concentration indices were calculated for each tax scenario (sensitivity analysis) to
quantify the degree to which HALYs gained are concentrated in disadvantaged groups. The

where ut is the mean number of HALYs of the tth SEIFA group, ft is its population share, and

Results
Enacting a 20% SSB sales tax in Australia was estimated to result in greater decreases in weight
for the 3 most disadvantaged quintiles than for the 2 least disadvantaged quintiles for both
men and women, with larger decreases in men. Quintile 5 (least disadvantaged) had the lowest
predicted reductions in weight for men and women (Figs 2 and 3).
As a result of a 20% SSB tax, the Australian population was estimated to gain 175,300
HALYs (95% CI: 68,700; 277,800) and save 111,700 years of life (95% CI: 43,600; 175,800)
(Table 3). The HALY gains were highest in the 2 most disadvantaged quintiles, with 49.4% of
the total HALYs gained accruing to these quintiles. Quintile 5 had the lowest HALYs gained
and years of life saved for men and women.
The tax was estimated to be cost saving across all intervention scenarios (sensitivity analy-
ses) and all quintiles. Over the lifetime of the population cohort, expected healthcare cost sav-
ings were AU$1.73 billion, intervention costs were estimated to be AU$119.6m (95% CI:
$91.9m; $162.1m)—approximately $4.8m (95% CI: $3.9m; $6.1m) in the first year and $3.7m

 (95% CI: $2.8m; $5.0m) in subsequent years, discounted at 3%. For every dollar invested in the
first 10 years, the tax would result in AU$17 (95% CI: $9; $19) in healthcare cost savings. The
tax revenue generated at the population level was estimated to be AU$642.9m annually (95%
CI: $348.2m; $1,117.2m).
For the total population, the out-of-pocket healthcare costs saved were estimated to be AU
$299.4m (95% CI: $113.8m; $476.2m). Healthcare cost savings as a percentage of household
expenditure by quintile were highest in the most disadvantaged groups. Per capita, the most
disadvantaged quintile was estimated to incur the most tax, at an estimated AU$35.40 (95%
CI: $18.70; $62.80) per year, or 0.54% of expenditure on food and non-alcoholic drinks.
The tax revenue raised outweighed the DWL for the total Australian population, with an
estimated net deadweight impact of +AU$587.9m (95% CI: +$329.2m, +$1,027.6m) per year.
The DWL was more than offset by tax revenue across all quintiles, with substantial net gains in
each quintile (Table 4).
Sensitivity analyses
The SSB tax remained cost saving when (1) the pass-through rate was 50%, (2) the rate of the
tax was 30%, (3) flavoured milk was included as an SSB, and (4) a volumetric tax was applied
at 50¢ per litre (see S4 Table). For each dollar invested in the first 10 years, the resulting health-
care cost savings ranged from $10 to $25 (Table 5).
All tax scenarios have a negative concentration index, indicating that the highest proportion
of HALYs gained is amongst the most disadvantaged quintiles. The 50% pass-through of a
20% tax and the 50¢ per litre tax had the largest negative indices, indicating the most equitable
scenarios (Table 5).

 The 30% tax rate scenario resulted in the largest difference between the lowest and highest
quintiles in terms of out-of-pocket costs for the tax; however, this scenario resulted in the larg-
est health gains and healthcare costs saved across the population. Compared to a 20% tax, a
50¢ volumetric tax resulted in smaller health gains across all SEIFA quintiles, due to the level
of tax translating to a lower level of price increase across all drink categories.
Discussion
In our study we estimate that a 20% sales tax on SSBs in Australia would result in the largest
number of obesity-related HALYs being averted in the population living in the most disad-
vantaged SEIFA quintiles, and it follows that the most healthcare cost savings overall would
accrue to these groups. The expected out-of-pocket tax expenditure was highest in the most
disadvantaged quintile; however, the difference of 0.32% points (less than 10¢) between the
lowest and highest quintiles in proportion of household spending on food and non-alco-
holic beverages per week was small. Our results indicate that, as a proportion of overall
spending, the lowest SEIFA quintiles would have the largest out-of-pocket healthcare cost
savings.
The DWLs for each SEIFA quintile, as well as for the whole population, were negative. This
indicates that the loss of consumer/producer benefit would be outweighed by the amount of
tax collected under our assumptions. The ‘loss in economic welfare’ is often calculated as the
dollar amount of DWL in excess of dollar taxation revenue collected by the government. In
our analysis there is a substantial net taxation gain suggestive of an improvement in economic
welfare (this underlies the rationale for internalisation of negative externalities). But there are
also behavioural responses associated with this inherently dynamic interaction that are difficult
to model in these formulaic terms—desirably, industry would realign to healthier products
and minimise its loss in producer surplus, consumers would realign to healthier purchases and
minimise their loss in consumer surplus, and, finally, the tax revenue could be utilised for wel-
fare-enhancing initiatives.
In the United Kingdom, it was considered reasonable to assume a pass-through rate of
100%; however, empirical evidence is mixed. The effect of manufacturers or retailers absorbing
part of the tax could decrease the impact of the tax and the resulting health benefits; however,
based on our predicted results for a 50% pass-through, the healthcare cost savings would nev-
ertheless be substantial. There could also be an additional ‘halo effect’—a decrease in purchas-
ing of SSBs from the introduction of the tax caused by increased public health awareness.
This research builds on the growing evidence that a tax on SSBs would deliver the largest
health gains for the lowest socioeconomic groups. It also reinforces previous findings that the
overall amount of tax per capita for a 20% value-added tax is around $30 per year, or less than
60¢ per week, and differences in tax expenditure between the lowest and highest socioeco-
nomic groups are small [19].
The predicted body weight losses in our study are lower than those in Sharma et al.’s study
[28], and this is because we took into account age and sex differences. Tax expenditures in our
study are higher overall, and this is due to different price assumptions, as well as differing base-
line intake of SSBs. The differences in baseline intake can be explained by the differing data
collection methods. We used individual survey data recorded over 2 days from the AHS 2011–
12, from which we took an average daily intake. These averages are close to the estimates from
Euromonitor International of per capita purchases of SSBs in Australia [55]. Our predicted
HALYs saved and expected tax revenue are slightly higher than in the previous Australian
study that also modelled a 20% tax on SSBs [21], but this to be expected given that we included
children in our analysis. Our predicted healthcare cost savings are higher due to a different

 method for calculating cancer treatment costs, based on the incidence rates rather than preva-
lence, and all costs have been updated to 2010.
This is possibly the first cost-effectiveness study to include the explicit health and economic
outcomes by SEP and the resulting DWLs. It also expands on previous Australian research to
include a wider range of SSBs and substitute beverages. We used conservative own-price elas-
ticities that were close to half the value of other published price elasticities for soft drinks
[45,56]. They take into account that SSB prices are not fixed, and households might face a qual-
ity—quantity tradeoff for each beverage and could opt for cheaper brands if they prefer quan-
tity over quality [28].
When comparing our average changes in adult kilojoule intake per day for the population
to a randomised control trial of overweight and obese adults who replaced all caloric SSBs with
non-caloric beverages, the tax has approximately 20%–26% of the impact of the results from
the trial (49 kcal/day decrease in our model versus 260 kcal/day and 187 kcal/day decreases for
overweight and obese individuals, respectively, in the trial) [57]. This proportion of the effect
is similar to the average change in own-price elasticities of consumption across all categories
of SSBs of approximately 23% for all households as a result of a 20% SSB tax when compared
to the trial [28].
As with all simulation models, the model results represent the best estimate of a potential
effect in the absence of stronger direct evidence. We used an aggregate area-based indicator of
SEP (SEIFA), as we were unable to obtain income-specific input data. We therefore assumed
that price elasticities for household income groups were similar for SEIFA groups. There are
also inherent limitations of survey data, such as misreporting, which may have affected the
baseline intake of SSBs. Cross-price elasticities of food substitutes by SEP were not available, so
these were not included [58]. Around 75% of soft drink sales are from supermarkets, and
prices may be slightly different to our estimates.
In some instances, we used costing frameworks from the US and NZ in the absence of Aus-
tralian estimates. NZ costs for policy advice provided by government agencies to parliament
related to new laws is likely to be similar to their Australian equivalents, as the legal systems
and number of new laws passed in Australia and NZ are similar. Costs to the government for
compliance and administration of the introduction of plain packaging of tobacco products in
Australia were similar to our estimates [46].
The model does not incorporate the effects of changes in SSB consumption on oral health
or indirect costs, such as reduced productivity due to absenteeism and disability, which means
that the societal savings from the intervention are likely to be substantially underestimated,
especially to those in the most disadvantaged groups. The assumptions for the quality of life
lost in children due to obesity are based on the best available evidence, but this evidence is
from only particular age groups of school-aged children, and we have assumed the effects are
similar for a wider age group.
Dedicating a portion of the substantial revenue generated from SSB taxes to efforts to
reduce and prevent obesity among the most disadvantaged populations could be a way to fur-
ther reduce concerns about the impact of the tax on low SEP groups. Hypothecation of taxes is
also effective in generating public support [59]. There is evidence in Australia that earmarking
the tax revenue for subsidising healthy food [60], tackling childhood obesity, and supporting
children’s sport [61] and health promotion initiatives [62] would raise the public support for
such a tax. Future studies could examine where to direct the revenue from an SSB tax for opti-
mal equity, efficiency, and affordability.
Many countries and jurisdictions around the world have committed to an SSB tax, and this
analysis shows that a 20% SSB tax is likely to result in a decrease in the purchase and consump-
tion of sugary drinks, leading to significant health gains and healthcare expenditure savings

 across all quintiles of SEP. The tax would result in considerable yearly revenue that the govern-
ment could use to reduce the regressive financial impacts, by funding programs to further
improve the health of the most disadvantaged. Australia should consider a tax on SSBs as part
of a suite of recommended policies to reduce the rates of obesity.
