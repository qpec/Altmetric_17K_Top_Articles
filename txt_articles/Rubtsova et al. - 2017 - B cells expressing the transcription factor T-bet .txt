Introduction
Autoimmunity is the third most common type of disease in the 
United States. Although such diseases can be treated, there is 
no cure for autoimmunity; therefore, it is extremely important 
to study the mechanisms that trigger these diseases. Innate and 
adaptive immunity are involved in the development and progres-
sion of autoimmune diseases. B cells are known to be involved in 
different aspects of autoimmune diseases and may contribute in 
a number of ways including the secretion of autoantibodies, pro-
cessing and presentation of autoantigen to T cells, and production 
of inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, B cells are promising tar-
gets for treatment of autoimmune diseases (1–3).
Indeed, this idea has been put into practice and B cell depletion 
therapy has been tested for multiple autoimmune diseases. The 
results of B cell depletion in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are 
still controversial (4). However, such therapies have been effective 
in some patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and multiple scle-
rosis (MS) (5, 6). It is not yet known why B cell depletion is effective 
for some but not all diseases and for some but not all patients with 
a particular malady. One possibility is that the depletion therapies 
might not affect all B cell subsets equally well and different dis-
eases, or different patients, might have involvements of different B 
cell subsets. Nevertheless, B cells are attractive targets for the treat-
ment of many different autoimmune disorders and more targeted 
approaches focusing on pathogenic autoreactive B cells (as opposed 
to depletion of all B cells) may be tremendously beneficial.
A novel subset of B cells named age-associated B cells (ABCs) 
has recently been identified by others and ourselves (7–10). Unlike 
other B cells, ABCs express high levels of CD11c and the transcrip-
tion factor T-bet. T-bet was subsequently demonstrated to be neces-
sary and sufficient for the appearance of this subset (7, 11), and trig-
gering of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR), IFN-γ receptor (IFN-γR), 
and TLR7 on B cells induces high levels of T-bet expression (12).
Our previous data demonstrated that T-bet+ ABCs appear 
in autoimmune patients and in autoimmune-prone mice (7, 
13). These cells produce high amounts of autoantibodies upon 
stimulation in vitro, suggesting that they are major precursors of 
autoantibody-secreting cells (7). Moreover, our recent findings 
indicate that ABCs are very potent antigen-presenting cells and 
therefore might participate in autoimmune responses by present-
ing self-antigen to autoreactive T cells (14). In agreement with our 
findings, a recent study by Becker et al. demonstrated elevated 
levels of T-bet expression in B cells obtained from peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells of SLE patients when compared with 
healthy donors, suggesting that T-bet expression in B cells may 
be critical for the development of lupus in humans (15). Others 
have reported that T-bet–expressing B cells are associated with 
Crohn’s disease activity (16), and an increased expression of 
T-bet in B cells was found in a patient with MS and celiac disease 
(17), altogether suggesting an important role for T-bet–expressing 
B cells in human autoimmunity (18).
Therefore, we hypothesized that ablation of ABCs will pre-
vent or delay the development of lupus-like autoimmunity. We 
tested this hypothesis by conditionally deleting T-bet from B 
cells in the SLE1,2,3 mouse model of SLE. Our data demonstrate 
that this deletion leads to reduced kidney pathology, prolonged 
survival, and delayed appearance of autoantibodies in these SLE 
mice. Moreover, our data suggest that T-bet expression in B cells is 
required for the rapid formation of spontaneous germinal centers 
(GCs) that develop without purposeful immunization or infection 
during such autoimmune responses (19, 20). The results indicate 
a critical role for T-bet expression in B cells for the generation of 
efficient autoimmune responses and the development of lupus-
B cells contribute to multiple aspects of autoimmune disorders and may play a role in triggering disease. Thus, targeting  
B cells may be a promising strategy for treating autoimmune disorders. Better understanding of the B cell subsets that are 
responsible for the development of autoimmunity will be critical for developing efficient therapies. Here we have reported 
that B cells expressing the transcription factor T-bet promote the rapid appearance of autoantibodies and germinal centers  
in spontaneous murine models of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Conditional deletion of T-bet from B cells impaired  
the formation of germinal centers and mitigated the development of kidney damage and rapid mortality in SLE mice.  
B cell–specific deletion of T-bet was also associated with lower activation of both B cells and T cells. Taken together, our 
results suggest that targeting T-bet–expressing B cells may be a potential target for therapy for autoimmune diseases.

lupus. First, we measured proteinuria levels in SLE mice with 
or without T-bet expression in B cells. SLE mice in our facil-
ity develop proteinuria by 7 months of age; therefore, we tested 
7-month-old mice for the presence of proteinuria. The data indi-
cate that the proteinuria score was significantly reduced in the 
absence of T-bet–expressing B cells (Figure 2A). The mice were 
subsequently tested again until they were 12 months old. Only 
one additional SLE × T-betfl/fl × CD19Cre/WT mouse (out of 9) devel-
oped proteinuria during this time frame, indicating that develop-
ment of proteinuria was prevented rather than delayed in SLE 
mice with B cell–specific T-bet deletion (Supplemental Figure 1; 
supplemental material available online with this article; https:/
/
doi.org/10.1172/JCI91250DS1).
To further evaluate kidney disease in the mice, the kidney glom-
eruli of SLE × T-betfl/fl × CD19Cre/WT and SLE × T-betfl/fl × CD19WT/WT 
 
littermate controls were evaluated by a blinded expert observer. 
The kidneys were obtained at the time of sacrifice when the mice 
were 12 months old, or earlier if the mouse exhibited high protein-
uria and/or lost 10% of body weight. The results, shown in Figure 
2, B–E, indicate that approximately 80% of glomeruli demonstrat-
ed hypercellularity and endocapillary proliferation in SLE × T-betfl/fl 
× CD19WT/WT littermate controls. In contrast, less than 30% of the 
glomeruli were affected in the SLE × T-betfl/fl × CD19Cre/WT mice.
To confirm that the kidney pathology was associated with 
immune complex deposition, immunofluorescence histology was 
performed. Kidney sections were stained with anti-IgG and anti-
C3 antibodies to detect immune complex deposition. Our results 
indicate that, in the absence of T-bet expression in B cells, SLE 
mice contained less immune complex formation in the kidneys 
since the size and/or intensity of IgG/C3 stained glomeruli were 
significantly reduced (Figure 2, F–H).
Together, these data indicate that T-bet expression in B 
cells plays a critical role for the development of kidney pathol-
ogy during lupus-like autoimmunity.
Improved survival of SLE mice with B cell–specific T-bet deletion. 
Since kidney failure is the major cause of death of SLE mice, we asked 
whether the improved kidney function in SLE × T-betfl/fl × CD19Cre/WT 
like autoimmunity, and suggest that specific targeting of T-bet+ 
B cells might be a useful therapy for some autoimmune diseases.
Results
Generation of autoimmune-prone mice with a B cell–specific deletion 
of T-bet. B6.SLE1,2,3 mice (referred to hereafter as SLE mice) were 
used as a model of spontaneous lupus-like autoimmunity. These 
mice express intervals of chromosomes 1, 4, and 7 derived from 
NZM2410 animals on the C57BL/6 background. These genetic 
intervals have been shown to drive lupus-like disease since SLE, 
unlike B6, animals contain activated lymphocytes, autoantibod-
ies, and develop glomerulonephritis, with a female bias (21–23). 
We confirmed that, like other mouse models of SLE, SLE mice 
accumulate T-bet+ ABCs (Figure 1 and ref. 7).
To study the effect of T-bet expression in B cells in autoim-
munity, we intercrossed CD19Cre/WT and T-betfl/fl with SLE mice, 
generating SLE × T-betfl/fl × CD19Cre/WT mice. This strain contains 
all of the intervals (from chromosomes 1, 4, and 7) necessary for 
predisposition to autoimmunity and lacks T-bet expression in B 
cells. The successful transfer of all intervals specific for SLE mice 
was checked by PCR (see Methods). B cell–specific T-bet deletion 
in the SLE × T-betfl/fl × CD19Cre/WT mice was confirmed by both PCR 
and intracellular staining (Figure 1). We confirmed that the T-bet 
deletion was B cell specific and that T cells continued to express 
normal levels of T-bet (data not shown).
Thus, we have successfully generated autoimmune-prone 
mice with a B cell–specific T-bet deletion.
In these animals Cre is driven by the CD19 promoter with con-
comitant deletion of CD19; thus, B cells in such mice are heterozy-
gous for expression of CD19. To check that this did not affect disease 
onset, we confirmed that autoimmunity occurred similarly in SLE × 
CD19WT/WT and SLE × CD19Cre/WT animals (data not shown), so SLE × 
T-betfl/fl × CD19WT/WT littermate controls were used for all experiments.
In the absence of T-bet in B cells, SLE mice demonstrate improved 
kidney function and better survival rates. First we asked whether 
T-bet expression in B cells was required for the development of 
kidney pathology, a definitive measure of organ pathology in

B cell–specific T-bet deletion leads to reduced titers of serum IgG2a 
in SLE mice. Next we asked which changes in the immune sys-
tem lead to the improved kidney function and reduced mortality 
in SLE mice that lack B cell–intrinsic T-bet. Multiple groups have 
previously reported that T-bet expression in B cells is critical for 
switching B cell isotype expression to IgG2a/c (described herein as 
IgG2a) (24–26). Therefore, we measured the presence of different 
IgG subclasses in the sera of SLE × T-betfl/fl × CD19Cre/WT mice com-
pared with SLE × T-betfl/fl × CD19WT/WT littermate controls. Figure 
3A demonstrates that the serum concentrations of total IgG were 
comparable between the experimental and control animals; how-
animals also affected their mortality rates. As demonstrated in Figure 
2I, the survival of SLE mice was dramatically improved in the absence 
of T-bet expression in B cells when compared with littermate con-
trols. Only 25% of T-bet–sufficient SLE mice survived until 12 months 
of age when, in contrast, 90% of SLE mice with B cell–specific T-bet 
deletion survived until the same age (Figure 2I). This finding demon-
strates that T-bet expression in B cells plays a critical role in the devel-
opment and the consequences of lupus-like autoimmunity.
Overall our data demonstrate that T-bet expression in B cells 
is essential for the development of kidney pathology and rapid 
mortality in SLE mice.

difference between the SLE × T-betfl/fl × CD19Cre/WT and SLE × T-betfl/fl 
 
× CD19WT/WT control mice lessened, although the titers in T-bet– 
deficient animals were still significantly lower than those in mice 
containing T-bet+ B cells. This suggests that another transcription 
factor (or a combination of transcription factors) can compensate 
for the lack of T-bet expression in B cells, leading to the activation 
of autoreactive B cells and their production of autoantibodies. One 
of the obvious candidates for such a transcription factor is EOMES, 
which has been reported to compensate for lack of T-bet expression 
in T cells (28). However, we were unable to detect EOMES expres-
sion in T-bet–deficient B cells (data not shown), suggesting the 
involvement of some other yet unknown transcription factor.
B cell–specific T-bet deletion affects both B and T cell compartments 
during autoimmune responses. To find out why the absence of T-bet 
expression in B cells led to the delayed appearance of autoantibod-
ies and reduced kidney damage, we compared the B cell compart-
ments of SLE × T-betfl/fl × CD19Cre/WT and SLE × T-betfl/fl × CD19WT/WT 
littermate control mice. Our data indicate that the absence of T-bet 
expression in B cells correlated with a reduction in frequencies and 
ever, the isotype distribution was altered in the absence of T-bet 
expression in B cells. In particular, as predicted by previous reports 
(25–27), in the absence of T-bet+ B cells there was a significant 
reduction in IgG2a levels, such that it decreased to levels seen in 
normal C57BL/6 animals. This was accompanied by increased lev-
els of IgG2b and IgG1 in SLE × T-betfl/fl × CD19Cre/WT mice compared 
with their Cre-negative littermate controls.
B cell–specific T-bet deletion leads to reduction of autoantibodies in 
SLE mice. The presence of high titers of autoantibodies is essential 
for the development of kidney failure during the development of 
lupus-like autoimmunity. Therefore, next we evaluated how T-bet 
expression in B cells affected the development of autoantibodies. We 
monitored the appearance, over time, of serum anti-chromatin IgG 
levels in the SLE mice in the absence or presence of T-bet expression 
in B cells. The appearance of anti-chromatin total IgG autoantibod-
ies (Figure 3B) and of anti-chromatin IgG2a in particular (Figure 3C) 
was significantly delayed in the absence of T-bet expression in B cells, 
when compared with littermate controls. The difference was most 
marked when the mice were 5 months old. However, later in life, the

of T-bet expression in B cells might affect T cell activation in 
autoimmunity. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the T cell 
compartments in SLE mice in the presence or absence of T-bet 
expression in B cells. Our data indicate that there was a sig-
nificant reduction in the percentage and numbers of activated/
memory CD4+ T cells but not of CD8+ T cells in the absence of 
T-bet–expressing B cells (Figure 5, A and B). On the other hand, 
the percentages and numbers of IFN-γ–producing CD4+ T cells 
were not affected by the absence of T-bet–expressing B cells, 
whereas the percentages (but not absolute numbers) of IFN-γ+ 
CD8+ cells did drop significantly (Figure 5, C and D).
GC B cells, preplasmablasts, and activated T cells do appear in 
aged SLE × T-betfl/fl × CD19Cre/WT mice (>7 months old) (Supplemen-
tal Figure 2), which is in line with our observation of the delayed 
appearance of autoantibodies in these mice (Figure 3), suggest-
numbers of CD11c+ B cells (Figure 4A). Surprisingly, we detected 
significantly lower frequencies and numbers of GC B cells in mice 
with a B cell–specific deletion of T-bet (Figure 4B).
Our data also demonstrate significant reduction in frequencies 
and numbers of early plasmablasts in SLE × T-betfl/fl × CD19Cre/WT 
mice compared with littermate controls (Figure 4C).
Together these data indicate that, in the absence of their 
T-bet expression, B cells fail to facilitate the formation of GCs 
during spontaneous autoimmune responses and do not dif-
ferentiate into plasmablasts, a failure that probably results in 
decreased autoantibody production.
Antigen (Ag) presentation by B cells plays an important role 
in spontaneous T cell activation during autoimmune responses 
(29). Moreover, it has been previously demonstrated that T-bet+ 
ABCs are potent Ag-presenting cells (14); therefore, the absence

ing that the autoimmune response is substantially delayed in SLE 
mice in the absence of T-bet–expressing B cells.
Overall, these data indicate that T-bet expression in B cells during 
spontaneous autoimmune responses is critical for B cell activation 
and generation of GC B cells and early plasmablasts (CD44+CD138+). 
Moreover, T-bet expression in B cells is also required for the efficient 
T cell activation during an autoimmune response, perhaps via its 
effect on B cell Ag-presenting abilities. These changes in B and T cell 
activation ultimately lead to the reduced titers of autoantibodies and 
reduction in immune complex formation and deposition in kidneys, 
which in turn improves the survival of SLE mice.
B cell–intrinsic T-bet expression is critical for the development of spon-
taneous GCs during autoimmunity. The low frequency of GC B cells in 
SLE × T-betfl/fl × CD19Cre/WT mice (Figure 4B) suggests that the animals 
might have impaired formation of spontaneous GCs. To test this, we 
confirmed by histological analysis of spleens that SLE × T-betfl/fl × 
CD19Cre/WT mice exhibited a defect in the formation of spontaneous 
GCs when compared with littermate controls (Figure 6, A–C).

A requirement for T-bet expression in B cells in the formation 
of GCs was unexpected. Therefore, we wondered whether this 
requirement was common to all circumstances leading to the cre-
ation of GCs, or applied only to their appearance in spontaneous 
autoimmunity. To answer this question we immunized T-betfl/fl × 
CD19Cre/WT and T-betfl/fl × CD19WT/WT mice with a conventional pro-
tocol involving nitrophenylated chicken γ globulin (NP-CGG) with 
alum, and analyzed for the presence of GCs in spleens 10 days 
after immunization. As demonstrated in Figure 6, the absence of 
T-bet expression in B cells did not affect the appearance of GC B 
cells (Figure 6D) or GCs (Figure 6, E–G) in response to deliberate 
immunization with Ag plus an adjuvant.
Together, these data indicate that T-bet expression in B cells 
is required for the formation of spontaneous GCs during autoim-
mune responses, but is dispensable for the formation of GCs in 
response to deliberate immunization, at least with an alum-adju-
vanted Ag. These findings are in line with recent reports indicating 
that IFN-γR expression in B cells is required for the formation of 
spontaneous GCs during autoimmunity (30, 31) and indicate dif-
ferential requirements for spontaneous and deliberate GC forma-
tion. This finding should be further examined in the future.
T-bet expression in B cells is required for the appearance of auto-
antibodies in Mer–/– and B6.Nba2 mice. Our data concern the role 
of T-bet+ B cells in the SLE model of lupus-like disease. However, 
other mouse models for this malady exist, so we asked whether 
the effects we observed were confined to SLE mice or were also 
apparent in other mouse models of SLE. To approach this ques-
tion we used 2 other mouse strains that are known to develop 
lupus-like autoantibodies: B6 mice lacking MerTK (Mer–/– mice), 
which have a defect in the clearance of apoptotic cells and gener-
ate autoantibodies with age (32), and B6.Nba2 animals (referred 
to hereafter as Nba2 mice), which express the autoimmune-pre-
disposing chromosome 1 locus of NZB animals (33). Both Mer–/– 
and Nba2 mice produce autoantibodies, but do not develop kid-
ney pathology (32, 34). We intercrossed these mice with T-betfl/fl × 
CD19Cre/WT mice, generating Mer–/– × T-betfl/fl × CD19Cre/WT or Nba2 
× T-betfl/fl × CD19Cre/WT mice with B cell–specific T-bet deletions.
As demonstrated in Figure 7A, Mer–/– animals with a B cell–
specific T-bet deletion had significantly decreased titers of anti-
chromatin antibodies in comparison with their Mer–/– littermate 
controls that contained T-bet+ B cells. B cell–specific T-bet dele-
tion in Mer–/– mice also resulted in a reduced frequency of GC B 
cells (Figure 7B). The appearance of spontaneous GCs in such 
animals was also significantly reduced (data not shown). Simi-
lar effects on autoantibody production were detected in Nba2 × 
T-betfl/fl × CD19Cre/WT mice (Figure 7C).
Since, as mentioned above, Mer–/– and Nba2 mice do not 
develop kidney pathology, we could not assess the effects of B 
cell–intrinsic T-bet deletion on the development of these clini-
cal features using these models of SLE. Nevertheless, these data 
show that our findings about the need for T-bet+ B cells for the 
appearance of autoimmune symptoms in SLE lupus-like disease 
is extendable to 2 other models of spontaneous autoantibody pro-
duction. In combination with the recent discoveries of similar B 
cells in human patients (16, 17), discussed below, our data suggest 
that ABCs may be targets of interest in treatment of such diseases.

The observation that the titers of autoantibodies of all IgG sub-
classes were reduced in the SLE × T-betfl/fl × CD19Cre/WT mice was 
unexpected. We expected to find a reduction in autoreactive IgG2a 
titers, since T-bet has been reported to be required for IgG2a isotype 
switching (24, 26, 35, 36) and B cell–specific T-bet expression has 
been demonstrated by us (11) and others (10) to be critical for the 
production of anti-viral IgG2a but not other IgG subclasses. Howev-
er, we thought that the lack of IgG2a-producing cells might be com-
pensated by increased production of autoantibodies of other types. 
Surprisingly, though, autoantibody titers in toto were reduced, sug-
gesting reduced activation of all B cells, regardless of their antibody 
isotype, in the absence of B cell–intrinsic T-bet expression. A simi-
lar observation applies to the fact that spontaneous GCs were also 
reduced in mice lacking T-bet in B cells. These findings are in line 
Discussion
In this report we demonstrate that T-bet expression in B cells is criti-
cal for the rapid initiation and progression of autoimmune responses, 
end-organ damage, and early mortality during lupus-like autoim-
munity. Even though autoantibody titers in mice lacking T-bet in B 
cells increase somewhat in older animals (>7 months old), these titers 
are still significantly lower than those in T-bet–sufficient controls. 
Perhaps this consistent difference in autoantibody titer, particularly 
with respect to IgG2a titers, is why the animals with T-bet–deficient 
B cells do not suffer accumulation of immune complexes in kidneys 
and end-organ damage and are much less likely to die an early death. 
Alternatively, or in addition, the T-bet–deficient B cells might produce 
autoantibodies of lower affinity, which might be consequently less 
pathogenic. These possibilities will be approached in future studies.

shown that ABCs, the T-bet–expressing B cells, are excellent Ag-
presenting cells (14), so the consequences of the absence of such 
B cells may be related to lowered stimulation of auto-Ag–specific 
T cells. Our model (Figure 8) indicates that upon stimulation via 
BCR/TLR/IFN-γR, B cells upregulate T-bet expression (Figure 
with the recent report by Barnett et al., in which they concluded that 
T-bet expression in B cells regulates a broad antiviral gene expres-
sion program, not only anti-viral antibody production (10).
How could T-bet+ B cells affect GC formation and the 
responses of other autoreactive B cells? We have previously 
Figure 8. Model. (A) Development of a lupus-like autoimmune response in the presence of B cell–intrinsic T-bet. Synergistic stimulation of B cells with auto-
antigen (auto-Ag), TLR ligand, and IFN-γ leads to the B cell–intrinsic T-bet expression (arrows a and b). T-bet+ B cells present auto-Ag to T cells (c), leading to 
subsequent T cell activation, IFN-γ production (d), and GC formation (h). Simultaneously, the GC reaction leads to further T cell activation (i) and differentiation 
of the B cells into autoantibody-producing (auto-Ab–producing) plasma cells (j). Finally, activated autoreactive T cells and autoantibody-producing plasma cells 
facilitate kidney damage (k and l). (B) The effect of B cell–intrinsic T-bet deletion on the development of the autoimmune response. Alternative pathway of B 
cell activation takes place when T-bet cannot be expressed by B cells (m), and also leads to the GC development and T cell activation (n and o); however, this 
pathway is delayed, less efficient, and generates less end-organ damage. Scale bars: 100 μm.

reactive B cells in the absence of T-bet. We have established that 
the T-bet–related transcription factor, EOMES, is not expressed 
by T-bet–deficient B cells in SLE × T-betfl/fl × CD19Cre/WT mice, so 
it must not act as the replacement for T-bet. It has recently been 
reported that Bcl-6 expression in B cells is required for the for-
mation of spontaneous GCs and the production of autoreactive 
antibodies in autoimmune mice (31). Therefore, BCL-6 might be 
involved in the T-bet–independent development of autoimmune 
responses. Preliminary RNA sequencing analyses reveal several 
factors that might play a role, including PLZF, a transcription fac-
tor that is also expressed in activated T cells and NKT cells (37, 38). 
These possibilities will be explored in the future. In addition, we 
will investigate how and why this alternative pathway does not 
lead to the development of end-organ damage.
Surprisingly and contrastingly, deliberate immunization with 
conventional Ag plus adjuvant did not require B cell–specific T-bet 
expression. Others have previously reported different requirements 
for GC formation in spontaneous autoimmunity versus deliberate 
immunization, with IFN-γR needed for the former but not the latter 
event (30, 31). These observations, together with another observa-
tion that TLR7 expression in B cells is needed for GC appearance in 
spontaneous autoimmunity (39), are in line with our findings with 
respect to T-bet+ ABCs, since ABC formation depends on IFN-γ and 
TLR7 signaling in B cells (11). However, the results of some others 
differ from those reported here in one respect, since some, but 
not all other studies found that T-bet expression in B cells was not 
required for spontaneous GC formation (30, 31).
Together these data suggest that the initiation of immune 
responses and the formation of GCs in response to auto-Ag is dif-
ferent compared with the immune response to foreign Ag. Why 
should this be true? One possibility is that the deliberate addition 
of adjuvant in immunizations involving foreign Ag automatically 
generates excellent Ag-presenting cells (dendritic cells) (40). Con-
trastingly, no such exogenous adjuvant is present during the gener-
ation of autoimmune responses in mice. Consequently, some other 
cell type, the T-bet+ B cells, may be needed to fulfill the need for a 
good Ag-presenting cell. An idea like this provides one additional 
explanation for the relative rarity of autoimmune diseases. Only 
under circumstances that can generate, without external stimula-
tion, ABCs (via BCR, TLR7, and IFN-γR engagement), thus provid-
ing an alternative to conventional Ag-presenting cells, can autoim-
munity be induced and/or exacerbated.
However, the crucial question is whether these data could be 
applicable to autoimmune diseases in humans. In order to answer 
this question, first a T-bet–dependent pathway of B cell activation 
in autoimmunity has to be demonstrated in humans. Fortunately, 
several groups, including us, have reported the presence of T-bet–
expressing B cells in autoimmune patients. Thus, we have reported 
a high frequency of T-bet–expressing B cells in RA and scleroderma 
patients (7). We demonstrated that T-bet+ B cells in humans could 
be identified as CD21–CD11c+, a phenotype that is similar to that 
which we observe in mice. B cells with a similar phenotype (CD21–
CD19hiCD11c+) have also been reported to be enriched in the blood 
of common variable immunodeficiency patients with autoimmune 
cytopenia (41, 42), SLE (43), RA (42), and Sjøgren’s syndrome (44). 
Supporting these original findings, several groups have recently 
reported the appearance of T-bet+ B cells in autoimmune patients 
8, arrows a and b, and ref. 11) and also a number of surface pro-
teins (MHCII, CD80, and CD86) that improve their ability to 
present Ag to T cells. Moreover, we have also shown that ABCs 
are located at the T cell/B cell border in spleens — a location that 
will increase the likelihood of contact between Ag-specific T cells 
and Ag-presenting ABCs (14) — and that ABCs are precursors 
for autoantibody production (7), indicating that their BCRs are 
autoreactive. All these features indicate that ABCs will be ideal 
presenters of auto-Ags to T cells. Their autoreactive BCRs will 
concentrate auto-Ags inside the B cells, increasing the number of 
MHCII/auto-Ag peptides on their surfaces and their high levels of 
MHCII, CD80, and CD86 will improve their presenting activities 
(Figure 8, arrow c). This increased Ag presentation will favor the 
formation of spontaneous GCs (Figure 8, arrows g and h), an idea 
that is supported by the lack of spontaneous GCs in SLE × T-betfl/fl 
× CD19Cre/WT mice. T cell activation leads to the enhanced pro-
duction of IFN-γ, which in turn may feed back, providing IFN-γ 
for the induction of T-bet expression in B cells (Figure 8, arrow f). 
Formation of spontaneous GCs leads to the generation of plasma 
cells producing high-affinity autoantibodies (Figure 8, arrow j) 
and T cell activation (Figure 8, arrow i). Finally, the presence of 
activated T cells and autoantibody-producing plasma cells leads 
to the formation of immune complexes and their deposition in 
the kidneys, facilitating end-organ damage and early mortality 
(Figure 8, arrows k and l). Therefore, ablation of B cell–intrinsic 
 
T-bet reduces Ag presentation by B cells, diminishing T cell acti-
vation, formation of spontaneous GCs, and enabling of B cell 
differentiation into autoantibody-producing plasma cells. All of 
these events eventually lead to the prevention of kidney damage 
and prolonged survival (Figure 8, arrows k and l).
Our data indicate, however, that autoimmune responses 
are not completely shut down in the absence of B cell–intrinsic 
T-bet. For instance, we found that autoantibodies, spontaneous 
GCs, and T cell activation occur in SLE × T-betfl/fl × CD19Cre/WT 
mice that are more than 7 months old, albeit later than in T-bet–
sufficient animals. These data suggest the presence of the alter-
native, less efficient, T-bet–independent pathway (Figure 8B, 
arrows m, n, and o). It is not clear whether this alternative path-
way also leads to the development of end-organ damage and 
death of the animals later in life. So far our data indicate that 
the appearance of autoantibodies is delayed by 2 months in the 
absence of B cell–intrinsic T-bet. However, their development of 
proteinuria must be delayed by much more than 2 months since 
the vast majority of SLE littermates with B cell–intrinsic T-bet 
deletion do not develop proteinuria even by the time they are 
12 months old (only 10% of these mice contain > 500 mg/dl of 
protein urine when they are 12 months old). In addition, 80% 
of T-bet–sufficient SLE mice die by the time they are 12 months 
old, whereas 80% of their littermates that lack B cell–intrinsic 
T-bet survive beyond that age. Moreover, we were able to keep 
an additional, smaller group of SLE × T-betfl/fl × CD19Cre/WT mice 
until they were 18 months old without apparent morbidity. Alto-
gether, these data suggest that the delayed response to auto-Ags 
that occurs in mice lacking T-bet+ B cells is less pathogenic and 
less damaging for SLE animals.
Ongoing and future studies will be directed to identify which 
transcription factor(s) is(are) responsible for the activation of auto-

XMG1.2 (previously described in ref. 47). Cells were analyzed by flow 
cytometry on a CyAn (Beckman Coulter) instrument and data were 
analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star).
ELISA. Plates were coated with goat anti–mouse total IgG anti-
bodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, catalog 115-005-003) (for total 
IgG), NP (for NP-specific IgG), or with in-house-made calf chromatin 
(for anti-chromatin IgG). Calf chromatin was made using Calf thymi. 
In brief, thymi were washed in sucrose/Tris/PMSF (STP) buffer, and 
homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was then 
strained, washed with STP buffer, and then nuclei were resuspended in 
Tris/KCl/MgCl2 (TKM) buffer. The mixture was underlaid with 60% 
sucrose/TKM, and centrifuged at 170 g for 10 minutes at 4°C with no 
brake. Nuclei at the interface were collected and washed in STP. The 
nuclei were incubated on ice for 1 hour. Afterwards, the nuclei were 
centrifuged at 3,600 g for 10 minutes and resuspended in 1 mM EDTA, 
causing lysis of the nuclei, following by centrifugation at 11,000 g for 10 
minutes at 4°C. The chromatin-containing pellet was washed 5 times in 
0.1 mM EDTA. The final pellet was resuspended in 1 mM EDTA, ali-
quoted, and stored at –20°C. Serum IgG levels (total or isotype specific) 
were detected using alkaline phosphatase–conjugated anti-IgG (South-
ernBiotech, catalog 1030-04), anti-IgG1, anti-IgG2c, anti-IgG2b, and 
anti-IgG3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch).
Proteinuria. The levels of protein in mouse urea (proteinuria) were 
detected using Chemstrip 2 GP (Roche). Proteinuria was scored as: 1 = 
trace, 2 = up to 30 mg/dl, 3 = 30–100 mg/dl, and 4 = 500 mg/dl or higher.
Kidney histology. Kidneys were harvested from mice as indi-
cated and were stored in formalin until paraffin wax preparation, 
sectioning, and subsequent staining with periodic acid–Schiff. To 
assess histologic injury of the kidneys, 25 glomeruli from each kid-
ney were examined by a blinded observer by using a BX51 micro-
scope (Olympus). Glomeruli were assessed for mesangial hyper-
cellularity, endocapillary proliferation, and crescent formation. 
The percentage of glomeruli in each kidney that demonstrated 
these findings was calculated, and the mean percentages for each 
group were compared. The pathology scores were performed by a 
board-certified nephrologist with extensive experience with mouse 
models of lupus nephritis.
Immunofluorescence microscopy of kidney immune complexes. Kid-
neys were examined by immunofluorescence microscopy for the 
presence of immune complexes by staining for IgG and C3. The kid-
neys were harvested as indicated, cut in halves, frozen in OCT, and 
stored at –80°C until use. Kidney sections (7 μm) were fixed with 
acetone for 1 minute and then rehydrated with PBS. The sections 
were blocked for 1 hour in PBS with 2% BSA and 0.05% Tween at 
room temperature and then incubated with antibodies. Polyclonal 
goat anti-C3 FITC-conjugated (MP Biomedicals, catalog 55500) 
and donkey anti–mouse IgG Cy5-congugated antibodies (Jackson 
ImmunoResearch, catalog 715-175-150) were used at 1:100 dilution. 
After that the sections were washed, and then mounted. The images 
were acquired under ×20 and ×10 objectives with a Zeiss LSM 700 
confocal microscope using Zen software. Images were analyzed 
using Slidebook software (3i). To quantify the area and relative 
fluorescence intensity of glomeruli, regions of interest were drawn 
around glomeruli. The area and mean fluorescence intensity of the 
region of interest were calculated using Slidebook software.
Immunofluorescence microscopy of spleen GCs. Spleens were har-
vested from mice as indicated, frozen in OCT, and kept at –80°C until 
suffering from SLE (15), MS (17, 45), and Crohn’s disease (16). 
Together these data strongly suggest that T-bet–dependent activa-
tion of autoreactive B cells takes place during the development and/
or progression of human autoimmunity. Moreover, several studies 
have indicated that human CD21–CD19hi B cells (the phenotype 
associated with T-bet expression) are enriched in autoreactivity, 
supporting the idea that T-bet–expressing B cells are key mediators 
of human autoimmunity (9, 44). In addition, gene expression pro-
files of human CD21loCD19hi B cells show that such cells are simi-
lar to those in mice (both subsets are CD21loCD23loCD19hiCD86hi 
CD11chiFAShiT-bethi; see refs. 7, 9, 18). Overall, we can conclude that 
human T-bet+ B cells very closely recapitulate their mouse counter-
parts, suggesting their overall similar function in the development 
of autoimmunity. Therefore, T-bet+ B cells appear to be very prom-
ising targets for treatment of human autoimmunity.
Development of a depleting agent that will specifically target 
T-bet+ B cells is a crucial step in order to apply this research to 
human disease. This is an extremely challenging task since so far 
no unique surface markers have been identified on T-bet+ B cells.
Methods
Mice. SLE, C57BL/6, and CD19Cre mice were purchased from The Jack-
son Laboratory and bred at the National Jewish Health animal facility. 
T-betfl/fl mice were provided by Laurie Glimcher (Dana-Farber Cancer 
Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA) and were intercrossed with 
CD19Cre and SLE animals to generate SLE × T-betfl/fl × CD19Cre/WT animals 
in which T-bet is specifically absent in B cells. SLE × T-betfl/fl littermates 
were used as controls for all experiments. Blood collection and protein-
uria assessment were performed on all experimental animals monthly. 
Mice that exhibited high levels of autoantibodies, high proteinuria 
(above 500 mg/dl), and/or weight loss were sacrificed. Nba2 and Mer–/– 
mice were also crossed to T-betfl/fl × CD19Cre/WT and the appearance of 
autoantibodies was assessed monthly. Female mice were used for all 
experiments. All animals were handled in strict accordance with good 
animal practice as defined by the relevant national and/or local animal 
welfare bodies, and all animal work was approved by the National Jew-
ish Health Animal Care and Use Committee.
Genotyping for SLE NZM2410–derived genomic intervals. Genotyp-
ing of all mice containing SLE NZM2410–derived genomic intervals 
was performed using oligos for D1Mit15, D1Mit17, D1Mit47, D4Mit9, 
D4Mit12, D4Mit17, D7Mit70, D7Mit145, D7Mit158, and Ckmm mark-
ers as described previously (46).
Flow cytometric analysis. Cells were stained with antibodies 
against mouse CD4 (clone GK1.5), CD8 (clone 53-6.7), B220 (clone 
RA3-6B2), CD11c (clone N418), CD19 (clone 1D3) CD44 (clone IM7), 
CD62L (clone MEL-14), GL7 (clone GL-7), CD138 (clone 281-2), and 
CD95 (clone 15A7) purchased from eBioscience, BD Pharmingen, or 
BioLegend. For intracellular T-bet staining, cells were surface stained, 
washed in PBS, and stained using Fixable Viability Dye (eBiosci-
ence), fixed and permeabilized with the FOXP3 staining buffer set, 
and stained with anti–human/mouse T-bet antibodies (eBioscience, 
clone 4B10). For intracellular IFN-γ staining, cells were cultured in the 
presence of PMA/ionomycin at 5 × 106 cells/ml in 24-well plates for 
18 hours, after which Golgi Plug (eBioscience) was added for another 
5 hours. Cells were washed, surface stained, fixed with permeabiliza-
tion/fixation buffer (eBioscience), and stained with in-house-made 
rat anti–mouse IFN-γ antibodies, produced by the hybridoma MP6-
