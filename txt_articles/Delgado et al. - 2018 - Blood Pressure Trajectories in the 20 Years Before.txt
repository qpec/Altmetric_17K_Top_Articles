IMPORTANCE There is mixed evidence that blood pressure (BP) stabilizes or decreases in later
life. It is also unclear whether BP trajectories reflect advancing age, proximity to end of life, or
selective survival of persons free from hypertension.
OBJECTIVE To estimate individual patient BP for each of the 20 years before death and
identify potential mechanisms that may explain trajectories.
DESIGN, STUDY, AND PARTICIPANTS We analyzed population-based Clinical Practice Research
Datalink primary care and linked hospitalization electronic medical records from the United
Kingdom, using retrospective cohort approaches with generalized linear mixed-effects
modeling. Participants were all available individuals with BP measures over 20 years, yielding
46 634 participants dying aged at least 60 years, from 2010 to 2014. We also compared BP
slopes from 10 to 3 years before death for 20 207 participants who died, plus 20 207
birth-year and sex-matched participants surviving longer than 9 years.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Clinically recorded individual patient repeated systolic BP
(SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP).
RESULTS In 46 634 participants (51.7% female; mean [SD] age at death, 82.4 [9.0] years),
SBPs and DBPs peaked 18 to 14 years before death and then decreased progressively. Mean
changes in SBP from peak values ranged from −8.5 mm Hg (95% CI, −9.4 to −7.7) for those
dying aged 60 to 69 years to −22.0 mm Hg (95% CI, −22.6 to −21.4) for those dying at 90
years or older; overall, 64.0% of individuals had SBP changes of greater than −10 mm Hg.
Decreases in BP appeared linear from 10 to 3 years before death, with steeper decreases in
the last 2 years of life. Decreases in SBP from 10 to 3 years before death were present in
individuals not treated with antihypertensive medications, but mean yearly changes were
steepest in patients with hypertension (−1.58; 95% CI, −1.56 to −1.60 mm Hg vs −0.70; 95%
CI, −0.65 to −0.76 mm Hg), dementia (−1.81; 95% CI, −1.77 to −1.87 mm Hg vs −1.41; 95% CI,
−1.38 to −1.43 mm Hg), heart failure (−1.66; 95% CI, −1.62 to −1.69 mm Hg vs −1.37; 95% CI,
−1.34 to −1.39 mm Hg), and late-life weight loss.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Mean SBP and DBP decreased for more than a decade before
death in patients dying at 60 years and older. These BP decreases are not simply attributable
to age, treatment of hypertension, or better survival without hypertension. Late-life BP
decreases may have implications for risk estimation, treatment monitoring, and trial design.

oth systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood
pressure (DBP) follow progressive upward trajectories
from childhood to middle age, but blood pressure (BP)
trends at older ages are unclear.1 Several studies reported flat-
tening of the upward trend or a decrease in BP at advanced
ages,1-4althoughafewhavereportedcontinuedBPincreases.5,6
Blood pressure decreases in older age have been associated
withpoorerhealth,onsetofdementia,andexcessmortality.7-10
Hypothesized explanations for BP decreases in later life in-
clude (1) advancing age; (2) increasing end-of-life disease, es-
peciallyheartfailure,suggestingalinktotheyearsbeforedeath
rather than to age; (3) more intensive use of antihypertensive
medications; or (4) that excess mortality of hypertensive in-
dividuals leaves healthy survivors with lower BP.1,10 Data to
testthesehypothesesarecurrentlylimited.Twoanalysescom-
bined several longitudinal studies to estimate BP trajectories
but did not observe the same individuals and did not follow
up to death.1,11
Observing individuals with multiple repeated BP mea-
suresovertimecouldhelpclarifythecausesunderlyingtrends.
If increasing end-of-life disease explains BP changes, then
similar downward BP trajectories should not be observed in
age- and sex-matched controls who die much later. For
example, Rogers et al12 compared 4-year BP changes in
404 patients with diabetes who died during follow-up against
3362 who survived and found greater BP decreases in those
who died. Similar data on the general older population or lon-
ger-term BP trajectories in individual older patients are not
available.
In this study, we used the population-based Clinical Prac-
tice Research Datalink (CPRD)13 to estimate clinically mea-
sured SBP and DBP trajectories for 20 years prior to death, for
individuals dying at 60 years and older. Second, we com-
pared the linear SBP trends for years 10 to 3 years before death
in patients who died and age- and sex-matched controls who
survived at least 9 years. These approaches aimed to separate
age from end-of-life associations, and avoid healthy survivor
biases.
Methods
Data Source
This study was approved by the Independent Scientific Advi-
sory Committee for UK Medicines and Healthcare Products
Regulatory Agency database research. Individual patient con-
sent for this analysis was waived, as only deidentified rou-
tinely collected data were used, following CPRD approval for
our research protocol. The CPRD is the UK National Health Ser-
vice observational data service for research, covering 674 UK
primary care practices.13 We used CPRD primary care elec-
tronicmedicalrecordslinkedtoHospitalEpisodeStatisticsdata
for hospitalizations, and UK Government Office for National
Statisticsdeathcertificatedata.14Registrationwithprimarycare
is nearly complete for older people in the UK: age and sex dis-
tribution data are similar to the UK population, and compa-
rableforethnicityandbodymassindex.13,15TheCPRDhasgood
ascertainment of major diagnoses.13,15
The 20-Year BP Trend Sample
For 20-year BP trends, we selected 54 856 individuals with
deathcertificatesorregisteredasdeceasedintheirgeneralprac-
titioner practice, from January 1, 2010, to November, 14, 2014.
Patients were included if registered and remaining with a prac-
tice for 20 years prior to death. We excluded 773 patients
younger than 60 years old at death and 7449 with BP re-
corded less than 6 times; 46 634 individuals met inclusion cri-
teria. Age at death (range, 60-111 years) was classified into 60
to 69, 70 to 79, 80 to 89, and at least 90 years.
Matched Cohort of Dying vs Survivors
(Last 10 to 3 Years of Life)
Separate groups were selected for comparing linear SBP tra-
jectories from 10 to 3 years before death. The case group
(n = 20 207)wereatleast60yearsoldanddiedJanuary1,2000,
toNovember14,2005.Survivorswerematchedbyyearofbirth,
sex, and SBP at start of follow-up, but survived at least 9 years
longer than paired cases (n = 20 207). Index date was date of
death of cases. We aimed for a 1:1 case-survivor matching. In-
dividuals were included if registered for 10 years prior to
index date, with BP recorded in at least 3 studied years.
Blood Pressure Measurements
Blood pressures were measured during routine consultations
and recorded by general practitioners, nurses, or other prac-
tice staff.13 National guidelines recommend a minimum of 2
consecutive measurements to ascertain elevated BP,16,17 but
in CPRD a single BP measurement is recorded from each con-
sultation, likely the measure considered of greatest clinical
relevance.13,18
Annual median SBPs and DBPs were calculated for each
calendaryear;thesewerebasedonameanof2.98(range,1-165)
separate recorded BPs and were available for a mean (SD) of
12.5 (3.86) of 20 years observed. Based on clinical and statis-
ticaladvice,weusedmedianrecordedBPsineachyeartoavoid
biases that could arise from analyzing possibly skewed distri-
butions from atypical measures, for example, recorded dur-
ing acute clinical events.19
Diagnoses at the Time of Death
We investigated BP trend associations with hypertension and
cardiovascular conditions (heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and
Key Points
Question Do blood pressures (BPs) decrease in older patients,
and if so are decreases related to age, proximity to death, or better
survival without hypertension?
Findings In a 20-year cohort analysis of medical records, systolic
and diastolic BPs decreased for 14 to 18 years before death.
Decreases were present in patients not treated for hypertension
but were steepest in patients with hypertension, dementia, heart
failure, and late-life weight loss.
Meaning Substantial BP decreases toward the end of life may
have implications for treatment monitoring, and decreases in BP
may also bias risk estimation and complicate trial design.

 stroke or transient ischemic attack) at any time before
death, plus cumulative burden of disease, measured by the
Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), and the Rockwood frailty
index (RFI)20,21 adapted for electronic medical records.
Hypertension diagnoses were removed from indexes to
avoid circularity. The CCI was based on 16 diagnoses any
time before death, and the RFI, on 36 diagnoses 15 years or
less before death. Analysis compared first quintile (least
comorbidity: CCI ≤2; RFI ≤0.09) with fifth quintile (most
comorbidity: CCI ≥9; RFI ≥0.26) during 20-year follow-up.
Statistical Analyses of Trajectories
We used linear mixed-effects models to estimate trajectories
of SBP and DBP. Trajectories were modeled as a function of
years until death, after adjustment for calendar year of death
and sex, the age at death (as years from individual’
s death age
to mean death age of age group), study entry year, and indi-
vidual-level Index of Multiple Deprivation (a postal code–
based socioeconomic marker). Separate models were run for
the 4 age-at-death groups. The linear mixed-effects model al-
lowed for correlations between repeated measurements on
the same individuals.22 The selected model for SBP used in-
dicator variables for each year before death to account for the
nonlinear form of trajectories (hereafter referred to as the step
function model).
The step function model was compared with 5 more par-
simonious mixed models with time to death represented by
linear, quadratic, cubic, and piecewise linear functions (1 knot
and 2 knots) (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). The Akaike infor-
mation criterion was used to select the best-fitting model
(details in eTable 1 in the Supplement). Figure 1 displays esti-
mated trajectories of SBP, constructed by plotting coeffi-
cients from the step function model for each time point t.
Analysis of Matched Cohort of Dying vs Survivors
Matched cohort analyses were performed by fitting linear
mixed-effect models with BP as dependent variable
and time as a linear function, adjusting for sex, age at
index date, calendar year of index date, and Index of Mul-
tiple Deprivation. Interactions were tested using likelihood
ratio tests and retained in the model if likelihood ratio χ2
P < .05.
Analyses of Diagnoses and Related Measures
We analyzed independent associations between 15 common
primary care diagnoses and change to SBP from 10 years to 3
years before death. This analysis included 39 370 individuals
from our main cohort with information available to calculate
changes in SBP. Medical conditions included asthma, atrial
fibrillation, coronary heart disease, cancer, chronic kidney dis-
ease (stage 3-5), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, de-
mentia, depression, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, heart failure,
hypertension, severe mental conditions (psychoses),23 stroke
or transient ischemic attack, and hypothyroidism. We used
multivariate regression analysis, adjusted for the same covar-
iates as the main step function model. Sensitivity analyses
assessed effects of antihypertensive treatment, weight loss,
smoking status, and physical activity. Weight loss was de-
fined as maximum recorded weight in the first 10 years of fol-
low-up minus last weight in the last 3 years of life. Physical
activity and smoking status were from records in the last 10
years (closest to death).

Results
A total of 46 634 individuals met the inclusion criteria for 20-
year BP trajectory estimation. Women were 45.5% of those dy-
ing aged 60 to 69 years vs 64.6% of those dying aged at least
90 years (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Hypertension was di-
agnosed at any time before death in 55.2% of the youngest and
67.2% of the oldest, and heart failure, in 7.7% of the youngest
vs 18.6% of the oldest.
Twenty years before death, estimated mean SBPs in-
creased with increasing age at death (60-69 years, 139.5; 95%
CI,137.9-141.2mmHg;≥90years,150.0;95%CI,149.0-151.1mm

ing aged 60 to 69 years (mean peak SBP, 146.3; 95% CI, 144.7-
148.0 mm Hg) to 18 years before death for those dying aged at
least 90 years (mean peak SBP, 150.8; 95% CI, 149.8-151.9 mm
Hg). In individuals with data on peak-year SBP and last year of
lifeSBP(n = 27918)(Table1),meanSBPchangerangedfrom−8.5

mm Hg (95% CI, −22.6 to −21.4) for those dying aged at least 90
years. Overall, 64.0% of individuals experienced SBP decrease
of more than 10 mm Hg. Decreases in DBP (eFigure 2 in the
Supplement)wereproportionatelysimilartoSBPdecreases,al-
though smaller in absolute numbers: for example, at 70 to 79
years, DBP decreased by a mean of 11.3 mm Hg, or 13.2%, from
peak values, compared with mean SBP decreases of 15.4 mm
Hg, or 10.6% (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
We examined 20-year SBP trajectories by multimorbidity
(Figure 2), using the CCI and adapted RFI (counting 36 com-
mon comorbidities), both excluding hypertension (see Meth-
ods). Overall trajectories appeared similar, with approxi-
mately 14-year linear decreases in SBP, but were a little steeper
with more comorbidity on the RFI. Accounting for time-
dependenteffectsofhypertension,atrialfibrillation,heartfail-
ure, and cancer diagnosis date, plus accumulating morbidi-
ties (CCI) in the last 20 years of life, changed SBP trends little
(eFigure 3 in the Supplement).
Antihypertensive medication was prescribed to 85.1% of
patients for at least 1 year during the analysis period: mean SBP
changed by −20.8 mm Hg from peak to year of death in those
treated vs −11.2 mm Hg in those not treated. Peak SBP oc-
curred at a mean of 15 years before death in the treated vs 14
years in those not treated. Adjustment for antihypertensive
treatment made little difference to the main model results
(eFigure 4 in the Supplement).
Smoking status, alcohol consumption, and levels of physi-
calactivitymeasuredinthe20yearspriortodeathhadlittleas-
sociation with SBP decreases (eFigure 5 in the Supplement).
Weight loss (the difference between the maximum weight
duringthefirst10yearsoffollow-upandweightinthefinalyear)
findings showed that patients losing at least 20 kg experi-
enced a bigger absolute SBP decrease (mean, −24.87; 95% CI,
−24.90to−24.83mmHg)comparedwiththosewhodidnotlose
weight (mean, −15.91; 95% CI, −15.94 to −15.87 mm Hg).
The trajectories of SBP from 10 to 3 years before death ap-
peared linear, so our analyses focused on this period, exclud-
ingacceleratedSBPdecreasesinthelast2yearsbeforedeath.24

 Systolic BP decreased in individuals who did not have hyper-
tension, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, or stroke or transient
ischemic attack (all diagnosed at any time before death)
(Table 2), but decreases were greater with each condition, es-
pecially hypertension: mean annual SBP decrease of −1.6 vs
−0.7 mm Hg without hypertension (interaction term, P< .001).
Independent associations of 15 chronic conditions against
change in SBP from 10 to 3 years before death were tested by
means of multiple regression. The mean overall adjusted
change (regression constant) in SBP was −0.55 (95% CI, −0.71
to −0.39) mm Hg per annum, with larger decreases with hy-
pertension,dementia,andheartfailure(eTable4intheSupple-
ment), followed by atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease,
and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The estimated
independent SBP decrease with coronary artery disease alone
(ie, adjusted for hypertension and all other conditions) and
cancer was a little smaller than the overall trend.
Last, a matched cohort analysis of cases who died vs sur-
vivors who lived at least another 9 years focused on linear BP
trends from 10 to 3 years to death. Decreases in SBP were more
marked in cases (Table 3).
Discussion
Previous studies have suggested that mean SBPs plateau or de-
creaseinolderpopulations,butthemechanismsinvolvedwere
unclear.1,11 In this analysis, we estimated individual patient BP
trajectories for 20 years to death, in a large representative older
population. For all age-at-death groups studied, mean SBP in-
creased to a peak 18 to 14 years before death. Peak values were
followed by substantial BP decreases. Overall, 64.0% of pa-
tients experienced SBP decreases of greater than 10 mm Hg.
Decreases in SBP were present without antihypertensive
treatment but were steepest in patients with treated hyperten-
sion, dementia, heart failure, and late-life weight loss. To our
knowledge, this analysis provides the first evidence that SBP
and DBP decrease for 14 or more years before death.
Worldwide, BPs have decreased over recent decades, but
from 2005 to 2015, SBP in high-income countries reportedly
decreased by 4 mm Hg or less in older groups (eTable 4 in Zhou
et al25). This is a small difference compared with trajectories
that we found observing individual patients in the years be-
fore death, and background trend effects would have been
present in both our cases and survivors in the matched co-
hort analysis.
Limitations
WehaveusedrecordedBPmeasuresfromroutineclinicalprac-
tice rather than standardized research approaches,26 but ob-
taining research BPs in representative older populations for 20
years to death would be challenging. We have necessarily lim-
ited the analysis to patients with sufficient numbers of re-
corded pressures. It may be that this selected patients tar-
geted by primary care for more frequent BP measures, but our
sensitivity analysis including patients with at least 1 year of re-
corded BPs (rather than ≥5 separate years) made little differ-
ence to results (eFigure 6 in the Supplement), suggesting that
measurement frequency is not a major influence on the tra-
jectories observed.

 Treatment for hypertension has been hypothesized as
explaining late-life decreased BPs, but decreasing BP slopes
were also present in those without hypertension diagnoses
or antihypertensive medication prescriptions. Changes in
antihypertensive prescriptions over time are often complex.
Unfortunately, CPRD records often contain limited detail and
accounting for dose equivalence of different preparation
combinations is complex. Changes in medication are
recorded without explanation, including whether they are
related to decreasing BP near death, raising the possibility of
confusing cause and effect. We have therefore not accounted
for specific treatment changes when modeling changing
treatment status over time. As noted herein, however,
decreases in BP were present in those not receiving antihy-
pertensive treatment, indicating that treatment and treat-
ment changes cannot provide a complete explanation for the
trajectories observed. Toward the end of life it is common
for antihypertensive medication use to be lessened or with-
drawn, but this should have increased BPs rather than caus-
ing decreases.
In most models, we tested associations between diagno-
ses at any time during study periods rather than accounting
for date of diagnosis. This was because many disease condi-
tions in older people develop over protracted periods long be-
fore diagnosis, and because BP measurements may have been
more likely when clinical events including diagnoses oc-
curred. Also, correlations over time before death may be dif-
ficult to validly disentangle. More extensive testing of poten-
tial correlates of the BP decreases may be justified in cases in
which systematic data on baseline and changing exposure sta-
tus over time are available, although distinguishing between
cause and effect can be challenging: for example, decreasing
weight may merely reflect the effects of the disease pro-
cesses leading to death.
Major strengths of our analysis include using large-scale
data on essentially complete older populations because vir-
tually all older people in the UK are registered with primary
care. This population representativeness removes poten-
tially serious healthier and cognitively intact response and re-
tention biases frequently seen in volunteer studies of older
groups.9-11 The inclusion of data over a 20-year period before
death is also exceptional.
As noted in the Introduction, several previous studies (but
notall)reportedaplateauordecreaseinBPlateinlife,although
there have been few published data on individual trajectories
before death. Molander et al27 and Londos et al28 described
steeperdecreasesinBPwithincidentdementiaandlowerMini–
MentalStateExaminationscores.28Londosetal28describedan
association between lower SBP and diagnoses of depression,
polypharmacy,andincreasedcomorbidities.Rogersetal12found
a steeper decrease in both SBP and DBP in patients with a di-
agnosis of diabetes. Decreasing SBP has also been associated
with an increase in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular
mortality.29Inouranalysis,wefoundthatlonger-termdecreases
in BP occurred with or without the presence of hypertension,
heartfailure,atrialfibrillation,orstroke.Additionally,thesede-
creases occurred at all studied levels of comorbidity. These re-
sults are in line with studies that found decreases in indicators
of cognitive (although not SBP), sensory, and physical health
to be associated with time to death.30-32
More work is needed to elucidate the specific mecha-
nisms involved in late-life BP dynamics. Such studies may also
be useful in addressing ways of optimizing the clinical care of
older patients who experience decreasing BP. Also, down-
ward BP trajectories before death have the potential to intro-
duce reverse causation or “reverse epidemiology” effects in
riskanalyses,yieldingmisleadingassociationsbetweenBPand
outcomes in older patients. Predeath trajectories of BP might
also introduce heterogeneity into trials of interventions.
Conclusions
In this large-scale analysis of individual patient trajectories,
meanSBPandDBPdecreasedfor14ormoreyearsbeforedeath.
Decreases in SBP were present in individuals not treated with
antihypertensive medications but were steepest in patients
with treated hypertension, dementia, heart failure, and late-
lifeweightloss.Thetrajectoriesmaybiasriskestimationinlater
life, and introduce heterogeneity into clinical trials of inter-
ventions. These findings may also have implications for treat-
ment monitoring in later life. More work is needed to better
elucidate the mechanisms explaining these long-term BP de-
creases toward the end of life.
