ABSTRACT
Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of an
individualised acupuncture protocol for patients
with fibromyalgia.
Methods Randomised controlled multicentre
trial, blinded to participants and to data analysts.
Conducted in three primary care centres in
southern Spain. A total of 164 participants aged
over 17 years and diagnosed with fibromyalgia
were enrolled in this trial; 153 participants
completed the study. Participants were randomly
assigned to either the real intervention
(individualised acupuncture, IA) or the sham
intervention (sham acupuncture, SA). In both the
IA and SA groups, one session per week (lasting
20 min) was provided, in addition to usual
pharmacological treatment. The primary
outcome was change in pain intensity at
10 weeks.
Results Intention-to-treat analysis revealed that
the decrease in pain intensity at 10 weeks was
greater (p=0.001) in the IA group (−41.0%,
95% CI −47.2% to −34.8%) than in the SA
group (−27.1%, 95% CI −33.2% to −20.9%).
During the follow-up period, significant
differences (p<0.01) in favour of the IA group
persisted at 12 months (IA: −19.9%, 95% CI
−24.6% to −15.1%; vs SA: −6.2%, 95% CI
−11.2% to −1.2%).
Conclusions Individualised acupuncture
treatment in primary care in patients with
fibromyalgia proved efficacious in terms of pain
relief, compared with placebo treatment. The
effect persisted at 1 year, and its side effects
were mild and infrequent. Therefore, the use of
individualised acupuncture in patients with
fibromyalgia is recommended.
Trial registration number ISRCTN60217348.
INTRODUCTION
Fibromyalgia affects 2–5% of the popula-
tion1
2 and has a high economic and
social impact.3 4 It is classified as a func-
tional chronic disease, and is manifested
clinically
by
chronic
widespread
pain
associated with fatigue, sleep disorder
and/or
depression,
among
other
symptoms.5
At present, there is no laboratory test
or imaging technique to help establish a
diagnosis of fibromyalgia, and no struc-
tural abnormalities have been observed in
the musculoskeletal system of patients
with fibromyalgia that could justify its
diagnosis.6
The
American
College
of
Rheumatology (ACR) proposed new diag-
nostic criteria in 2010, examined in a
31-point questionnaire.7 These criteria
were subsequently modified in 2011,8
and replaced the original criteria pub-
lished in 1990.9
Recent systematic reviews support the
use of pregabalin to treat pain, sleep pro-
blems, fatigue and anxiety in patients
with fibromyalgia.10
11 Positive results
have also been reported in studies of
serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake
inhibitors12
13
and
of
tramadol.14
However, the benefits of drug therapy
are questionable.15
Ninety-one per cent of patients with
fibromyalgia have tried some form of com-
plementary and
alternative
medicine.16
Although some treatment guidelines rec-
ommend prioritising non-pharmacological
interventions,17
and
recent
systematic
reviews suggest that both cognitive behav-
ioural therapy18 and approaches such as
massage, hydrotherapy and acupuncture
may be beneficial in the treatment of fibro-
myalgia,19 evidence of benefit is limited.15
One in five patients with fibromyalgia
resorts to acupuncture within 2 years of
diagnosis.20

 systematic review concluded that there is low to mod-
erate evidence for the use of acupuncture to treat
fibromyalgia pain and stiffness, compared to standard
treatments.21 Moreover, most randomised controlled
trials performed to date have not included persona-
lised treatment protocols, which is in contrast to usual
clinical practice.22 Furthermore, acupuncture appears
to be beneficial in the treatment of depression,
whether or not it is associated with chronic pain.23 24
Taking the above considerations into account, we
designed a randomised controlled trial to determine
the clinical efficacy of traditional acupuncture as a
treatment for patients with fibromyalgia, using a per-
sonalised
point-selection
algorithm
based
on
the
characteristics of each patient. In this respect, we
sought to reproduce standard clinical practice. W
e
aimed to evaluate the progression of the disease using
a
specific
measurement
system,
following
the
OMERACT
(Outcome
Measures
in
Rheumatoid
Arthritis Clinical Trials) recommendations,25 and to
assess levels of depression and pain sensation, quality
of life, duration of short-term disability, use of anal-
gesic and antidepressant medication, and the potential
effect of factors considered to be predictors of poor
prognosis.26
METHODS
This study was performed in accordance with the trial
protocol, which has been published elsewhere.27
Study design and participants
In this controlled multicentre prospective trial, all par-
ticipants were aged over 17 years and had been diag-
nosed with fibromyalgia according to ACR criteria.9
They had not received acupuncture before and were
referred by their general practitioner (GP) at one of
the three primary care centres included in the trial
(forming
part
of
the
Andalusian
Public
Health
System) to the physician leading the study at the
health
centre.
The
participants
were
randomly
assigned to the actual intervention group (individua-
lised acupuncture, IA) or to the sham intervention
group (sham acupuncture, SA). Participants in both
groups also received pharmacological treatment pre-
scribed by their GP
. All participants gave written
informed consent. Participants were excluded if they
had chronic pain in relation to any process other than
fibromyalgia, were using anticoagulants or opiates,
were pregnant or a nursing mother, or were involved
in occupational litigation for reasons involving fibro-
myalgia. The recruitment of participants began in
October 2010 and concluded in December 2012.
Randomisation and masking
After the participants had given informed consent, a
secure centralised telephone and fax randomisation
service was used to allocate them to one of the two
arms of the study. The randomisation sequence was
generated and administered at an independent clinical
trials unit (Marbella, Spain) to ensure that the alloca-
tion was concealed. Randomisation was on a 1:1
basis, stratified by centre. Given the nature of the
interventions conducted, the healthcare staff involved
were not blind to allocation, but all of the evaluations
were recorded by research nurses who were blind to
the treatment groups. These same nurses provided any
assistance required with the self-administered ques-
tionnaires. The specialist psychiatrists applying the
Hamilton Depression Rating hetero-evaluation Scale
(HDRS) were also blind to the allocation, as were the
staff responsible for performing the statistical analysis.
Interventions
The healthcare personnel who applied the different
acupuncture treatments at each centre involved in the
study had received at least 300 h training in the field
and had over 3 years’ practical experience.
The participants in the study received nine 20 min
sessions of acupuncture (real or simulated) at a fre-
quency of one per week, in addition to their usual
drug
treatment.
All
participants
were
diagnosed
according to the principles of Traditional Chinese
Medicine (TCM) by the medical expert at the health-
care centre.
The true acupuncture group received IA based on
their TCM diagnosis and according to a previously
established algorithm.27 The SA group received an
acupuncture simulation on the dorsal and lumbar
regions, in which guide tubes for the same type of
needle as used in the real acupuncture group were
applied to the body surface, but after removal of the
needles.27 The time devoted to the treatment and
evaluation
of
participants
was
identical
in
both
groups.
Outcomes
The data required to evaluate the efficacy of the treat-
ment were collected by interviews, self-applied ques-
tionnaires, and physical measurements at baseline (T0)
and at 10 weeks (T1), 6 months (T2), and 12 months
(T3) after the intervention had begun, in both groups.
The primary outcome was change in pain intensity,
measured
on
a
visual
analogue
scale
(PainVAS
0–100 mm),
at
10 weeks.
Secondary
outcomes
included change in level of depression, measured on
the HDRS,28 at 10 weeks and at 6 months; change in
health-related quality of life as measured by the two
summary components (physical and mental) of the
Short Form 12 (SF-12) health questionnaire,29 at
10 weeks,
6
and
12 months;
change
in
the
Fibromyalgia
Impact
Questionnaire
(FIQ),30
at
10 weeks, 6 and 12 months; change in PainVAS at 6
and 12 months; and change in the pain threshold and
number
of
tender
points,
at
10 weeks,
6
and
12 months. In addition, we measured the improve-
ment perceived by the participant31 at 10 weeks, and

 changes in use of medication at 10 weeks, 6 and
12 months. A cut-off point of HDRS ≥21 was estab-
lished to evaluate the effect on participants with
medium or severe depression.32 In order to evaluate
the influence of family structure, a semi-structured
interview, incorporating the genogram technique, was
performed.27
Statistical plan
The χ2 test (for binary and ordinal variables) and the
Mann-Whitney U test (for continuous variables, after
confirming
skewed
distributions
using
the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) were used to assess the dif-
ferences between the groups, for both independent
and outcome variables. In the latter case, mean differ-
ences in the relative changes at T1, T2 and T3 com-
pared to baseline (T0) between the treatment groups
were calculated and compared, both per protocol and
by intention-to-treat (ITT). For ITT
, missing values
were imputed using simple linear regression with
baseline values. In addition, the effect size of the ITT
analysis was calculated using Cohen’s d,33 based on
standardised mean differences. Finally, a stepwise
forward multiple linear regression model was con-
structed, taking the main outcome variable (relative
change in pain intensity T0-T1), and adjusting for age,
baseline disease severity (PainVAS, FIQ and HDRS),
pain threshold, and tolerance levels. The level of stat-
istical significance applied was p<0.01.
RESULTS
Of the 164 participants included in the study, 162
(98.8%), all female, constituted the final baseline
sample. T
wo withdrew before the start of treatment,
one due to comorbidity (acute myocardial infarction)
and the other due to a change of address. Thus, the
study comprised 80 participants in the IA group and
82 in the SA group (figure 1).
There were no differences between groups in the
distribution of any demographic and baseline clinical
variables (table 1). The most frequently diagnosed
TCM syndromes were Liver Qi stagnation (44.4%),
followed by Spleen and Kidney Yang deficiency (21%)
and Yin deficiency (13.6%). In 85.8% of the partici-
pants, a secondary associated syndrome was also diag-
nosed. There were no differences between the groups
regarding the distribution of the primary diagnosed
syndromes or the presence of a second syndrome (see
online supplementary file 1). A total of 114 partici-
pants (70.4%) responded to the ‘family structure’
questionnaire item. There were no significant differ-
ences between the groups for any of the variables
related to family structure or relationships, according

 to the results obtained using the genogram technique
(see online supplementary file 2).
The crude analysis of the main study variable
(change in PainVAS T0-T1), both per protocol (see
online supplementary file 3) and by ITT (p=0.001),
revealed a relative pain intensity reduction that was
greater in the IA group (−41.2%) than in the SA
group (−27.1%). The differences in favour of the IA
group persisted in the follow-up period, relative to
baseline, and at T3 (ITT: IA −19.9% vs SA −6.1%;
p≤0.001). For the FIQ scale, in the three evaluations
made, there were differences in favour of the IA
group, with ITT values of relative change at T1, T2
and T3 of −35.9%, −25% and −22.2%, respectively,
for the IA group, and of −24.5%, −11.2% and
−4.9%, respectively, for the SA group. On the phys-
ical scale of the SF12, and also with respect to the
pressure pain threshold, there was a relative improve-
ment in favour of the IA group at all time points
assessed. Finally, the reduction in the number of
tender points was higher in the IA group for both the
T0-T1 and the T0-T3 comparisons. Of a total of 20
tests, and after calculating the Cohen’s d values, 12
medium-strength effect sizes and one strong effect size
were observed (table 2).
The per protocol analysis of the various items
included in the FIQ (fatigue, night rest, stiffness,
anxiety and depression) revealed differences in favour
of the IA group. The improvement observed at
10 weeks after starting treatment (T1) was significant
for the following items: fatigue (IA −32.8 vs SA
−19.0, p<0.001), anxiety (IA −31.0 vs SA −17.8,
p=0.01), and depression (IA −33.0 vs SA−18.5,
p=0.01). During follow-up, statistically significant dif-
ferences in favour of the IA group were observed for
all items mentioned, both at 6 months (T2) and
12 months (T3) (table 3).
In the adjusted regression analysis of the primary
dependent
variable
(relative
difference
in
pain
intensity T0-T1), after adjusting for the number of
tender points (T0) and the total FIQ score (T0), parti-
cipants in the IA group presented a reduction in pain
intensity of −14.4 versus the SA group (table 4).
In the assessment of the blinding process, over 75%
of the participants in both groups were confident that
the treatment received was real acupuncture. Finally,
in the four questions concerning treatment expecta-
tions, the scores exceeded 8.5 points, and there were
no significant differences between the two groups (see
online supplementary file 4).
No serious adverse events arising from the study
interventions were reported in either group. The fol-
lowing mild adverse events occurred during the 1431
sessions received by the total number of participants:
aggravation of the symptoms of fibromyalgia, after 37
sessions (2.6%); headache, after 7 sessions (0.5%).
The following adverse events were exclusive to the IA
group (702 sessions): post-acupuncture pain, after 12
sessions (1.4%), post-acupuncture bruising, after 18
sessions (2.6%); and post-acupuncture vagal symp-
toms, after 5 sessions (0.7%). Online supplementary
files 5 and 6 describe the impact of treatment on use
of medication and fitness for work.
DISCUSSION
The results of this study show that the application of
an individualised acupuncture protocol significantly
reduced perceptions of pain intensity, and at the same
time improved the functional capacity and quality of
life
of
patients
with
fibromyalgia,
compared
to
placebo treatment. Both methods were safe, as indi-
cated by the low number of adverse events recorded.

treatment
and
during
the
follow-up
period.
Although both real and sham acupuncture were effect-
ive at improving the indicators, the effect of real acu-
puncture was significantly greater, both at the end of
treatment and during the 1-year follow-up period.
According to Cohen’s categories, the effect of acu-
puncture compared to placebo on pain intensity,
number of tender points, and pressure pain threshold
was of medium strength. This effect size was attenu-
ated at 6 months (T2) for pain perception, at which
point it became a low-intensity effect. It is noteworthy
that at 12 months (T3) this effect persisted, and even
increased in the case of the PainVAS variable. W
e
should view the T3 results with caution, as there was
an increased use of antidepressants in both groups
that may account for the increased size of effect on
the PainVAS variable, among others, at this stage.
According
to
the
IMMPACT
(Initiative
on
Methods,
Measurement
and
Pain
Assessment
in
Clinical Trials) recommendations concerning the inter-
pretation of clinical trials for the treatment of chronic
pain,34 the clinical improvement secondary to the
reduction of pain intensity experienced by the partici-
pants given real acupuncture treatment was moder-
ately important.
Functionality and quality of life/sense of wellbeing
Both the functionality (FIQ) and the quality of life/sen-
sation of wellbeing (SF12) of the participants in the
real acupuncture group were significantly better than
in the control group at the end of the treatment
period. The effect size was greater with respect to the
physical aspect of quality of life (medium intensity)
than for the mental aspect (low intensity), although
this effect persisted during the follow-up period. With
respect to functionality, the effect size was, in fact,
greater at the end of the follow-up period than at previ-
ous time points. This may be due to an increase in the
amount of antidepressant medication taken by partici-
pants at T3, as mentioned above, which may have
accounted for the improvement in the FIQ scores.
Depression
The individualised protocol applied in this study did
not prove to be efficacious in alleviating the level of
depression of the participants. Although the HDRS
scores decreased in both groups by the end of the
treatment period, the difference was not statistically
significant and the minimum HDRS reduction of 25%
considered to constitute a response was not reached.35
However,
at
T3,
a
significant
decrease
in
the
Hamilton
test
scores was
observed,
and
a
low-
intensity effect size was obtained when comparing the
two groups. As commented on above, this result is
probably due to the increased quantity of antidepres-
sants taken.

 Comparison with previous studies of acupuncture
In this study, we observed reductions of 41% and
36% on the pain intensity scale and FIQ scale,
respectively, at the end of the treatment period. These
values are higher than those reported for the same
variables in previous studies.36–39 In our study, the
strength of the effect size observed at the end of the
treatment period was notably greater (0.5 vs 0.14)
than that reported in a recent systematic review that
took into account major clinical trials of acupuncture
treatment for fibromyalgia.21
The observation herein that the positive effects of
acupuncture on pain reduction, functional capacity,
and quality of life were maintained both at 6 and 12
months is in contrast to previous similar studies.36–38
One fundamental difference between the present
study and earlier research is the implementation of
individualised treatment that was reassessed through-
out the intervention period. This may explain the
larger size and/or longer duration of the effect,
although we cannot be certain about this as there was
no non-individualised acupuncture comparator group
in the present study.
Comparison with previous studies of pharmacological
treatment
When comparing the results of this study with those
reported by systematic reviews of previous clinical
trials of various pharmacological treatments for fibro-
myalgia,
we
observe,
firstly,
that
the effect
size
obtained herein was greater than that of trials evaluat-
ing drugs considered first-line treatment for fibro-
myalgia,
such
as
pregabalin
(0.5
vs
0.28)10
or
duloxetine (0.5 vs 0.23).40 Moreover, the acupuncture
treatment described in this study was associated with a
lower rate of adverse effects than drug treatments
used in clinical practice.
Strengths and limitations
The main tangible advantage of our study is that we
carried out a clinical trial with blinding of the partici-
pants and data analysts and incorporated individua-
lised
acupuncture
treatment
protocols
for
the
treatment of fibromyalgia. This treatment produced
an
improvement
in
the
participants’
condition,
reflected
by
a
reduction
in
pain
intensity
and
enhanced functional capacity and quality of life after
the intervention and during the follow-up period.
Such an outcome has not been reported by previous
studies following the application of standardised treat-
ments; therefore, our results suggest that applying
individualised treatment algorithms when starting a
course of acupuncture may be important.
The present study has several limitations. Firstly, the
diagnostic criteria used were not the latest ones pro-
posed by the ACR,7 but those published in 1990,9
because the latter were the most current criteria at the
time
when
the
study
was
being
prepared.
Our
observation that, at the end of the follow-up period,
participants were using a significantly higher quantity
of antidepressant medication means that the results
obtained for that time point should be interpreted
with caution. In addition, under baseline conditions, a
higher percentage of participants in the IA group were
taking higher doses of pain medication relative to the
SA group, which could have magnified the improve-
ment observed in pain scores in this group. Notably,
however, this minor imbalance (the significance level
of which was above our predefined threshold of
p<0.01) was a chance result of the randomisation and
is therefore not likely to indicate bias.
Moreover, although at the end of the follow-up
period there had been a greater number of withdrawals
in the real versus sham acupuncture groups (7 vs 2), the
data obtained from the ITTanalysis did not vary greatly
from those obtained in subgroup analysis. Although
variables such as fatigue, sleep disorders, anxiety or stiff-
ness (symptoms that frequently accompany fibromyal-
gia) were not studied specifically
, the effect on these
variables was determined indirectly by taking into
account the results for the different FIQ items. In add-
ition, it would have been desirable to obtain a larger
number of measurements, in view of the chronic nature
of the pain and its possible fluctuations. However, meth-
odologically
, this was not possible.
CONCLUSIONS
In this study, individualised acupuncture treatment of
fibromyalgia in primary care was shown to be effica-
cious in providing pain relief and enhancing the
quality of life of patients. The effect persisted at
1 year, and adverse effects were mild and infrequent.
Furthermore, the effect of individualised acupuncture
was greater than that of sham acupuncture. The con-
flicting results between this and previous studies,
which
have
reported
negative
results,
may
be
accounted for by differences in the application of the
technique (individualised vs standardised).
