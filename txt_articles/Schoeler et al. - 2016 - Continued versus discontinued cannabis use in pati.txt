Introduction
Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug in 
patients with an existing psychotic disorder.1 In some 
studies, about one of every four patients with psychosis 
meets the criteria for cannabis dependence,2,3 with rates 
of use especially high in young people presenting with 
their fi
 rst psychotic episode.2 These rates are much 
higher than those of the general population4 or those of 
people with other psychiatric diagnoses.5 Although the 
association between cannabis use and onset of psychotic 
disorders is well established,6,7 suggesting that cannabis 
use is a component cause of the disorder,8 its eff
 ect on 
the course of psychosis after onset is less clear. This lack 
of clarity seems mainly related to limitations of study 
design such as cross-sectional approach, underpowered 
samples, and no consideration of potential confounders.9 
Some studies10–12 implicate cannabis use as a potential 
risk factor for relapse of psychosis as indexed by 
readmission to hospital, with some evidence supporting 
a dose–response association.13 Other studies report 
worsening of positive psychotic symptoms14,15 or less time 
to symptom re-emergence16 in cannabis-using patients 
with psychosis compared with non-users. These fi
 ndings 
are in line with experimental pharmacological challenge 
studies reporting that Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), 
the main psychoactive constituent in cannabis, can 
induce transient psychotic experiences in healthy 
individuals and worsen existing symptoms in patients 
with pre-existing psychosis.17–20
If cannabis use were associated with worse outcomes 
in individuals with established psychosis, then we would 
expect that those who continue using cannabis would 
have far worse outcomes compared with those who stop. 
However, although some evidence suggests that 
discontinuation of cannabis use might lead to a reduction 
in readmission rates21,22 and improvement in symptomatic

Summary
Background Although the link between cannabis use and development of psychosis is well established, less is known 
about the eff
 ect of continued versus discontinued cannabis use after the onset of psychosis. We aimed to summarise 
available evidence focusing on the relationship between continued and discontinued cannabis use after onset of 
psychosis and its relapse.
Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE for articles published in any language 
from the database inception date up until April 21, 2015 that included a sample of patients with a pre-existing psychotic 
disorder with a follow-up duration of at least 6 months. We used a combination of search terms for describing 
cannabis, the outcome of interest (relapse of psychosis), and the study population. We excluded studies if continued 
cannabis use or discontinued cannabis use could not be established. We compared relapse outcomes between those 
who continued (CC) or discontinued (DC) cannabis use or were non-users (NC). We used summary data (individual 
patient data were not sought out) to estimate Cohen’s d, which was entered into random eff
 ects models (REM) to 
compare CC with NC, CC with DC, and DC with NC. Meta-regression and sensitivity analyses were used to address 
the issue of heterogeneity.
Findings Of 1903 citations identifi
 ed, 24 studies (16 565 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Independent of the 
stage of illness, continued cannabis users had a greater increase in relapse of psychosis than did both non-users 
(dCC–NC=0·36, 95% CI 0·22–0·50, p<0·0001) and discontinued users (dCC–DC=0·28, 0·12–0·44, p=0·0005), as well as 
longer hospital admissions than non-users (dCC–NC=0·36, 0·13 to 0·58, p=0·02). By contrast, cannabis discontinuation 
was not associated with relapse (dDC–NC=0·02, –0·12 to 0·15; p=0·82). Meta-regression suggested greater eff
 ects of 
continued cannabis use than discontinued use on relapse (dCC–NC=0·36 vs dDC–NC=0·02, p=0·04), positive symptoms 
(dCC–NC=0·15 vs dDC–NC=–0·30, p=0·05) and level of functioning (dCC–NC=0·04 vs dDC–NC=–0·49, p=0·008) but not on 
negative symptoms (dCC–NC=-0·09 vs dDC–NC=–0·31, p=0·41).
Interpretation Continued cannabis use after onset of psychosis predicts adverse outcome, including higher relapse 
rates, longer hospital admissions, and more severe positive symptoms than for individuals who discontinue cannabis 
use and those who are non-users. These fi
 ndings point to reductions in cannabis use as a crucial interventional target 
to improve outcome in patients with psychosis.

and functional outcomes of psychosis,15,22–26 other research 
suggests that this scenario might not necessarily be the 
case.1,10,27,28 Nevertheless, about 30–50% of cannabis users 
stop using the drug after the onset of their psychotic 
illness,15,21–23,29 suggesting that this issue might be clinically 
relevant. Conclusions from individual studies need to be 
treated with caution in view of the modest sample sizes. 
Meta-analytic techniques off
 er a method of overcoming 
the sample size problem by statistically integrating the 
results from several separate studies thereby improving 
the power to detect signifi
 cant eff
 ects.30 Considering the 
confl
 icting evidence from individual studies investigating 
the relation between continued cannabis use and relapse 
and from studies looking at discontinued use and 
outcome, we have attempted to quantitatively summarise 
the present evidence. We aimed to establish whether 
continuing cannabis use is associated with poor outcome 
in established psychosis and establish the magnitude of 
this eff
 ect by pooling together the results of all available 
studies using a meta-analytic approach. We focused on 
outcome defi
 ned as relapse of psychosis, operationalised 
as either readmission to hospital or investigator-
established psychotic relapse. Because cannabis use is 
potentially amenable to treatment and a substantial 
proportion of patients with psychosis continue using the 
drug after onset of their illness, estimation of the eff
 ect 
of continuing cannabis use on a robust measure of 
outcome indicative of relapse, such as admission to 
hospital, is needed. This outcome is a reliably estimated 
measure, with substantial implications for the cost of 
health care.31 Although previous meta-analyses have 
investigated the association between continued and 
discontinued cannabis use and outcome in psychosis, 
they have mainly focused on symptomatic outcome 
measures such as positive and negative symptoms or 
depression scores, whereas outcome indexed by 
hospitalisation was considered only in the context of the 
eff
 ects of substance use in general.32–34 We therefore 
aimed to investigate whether continued use of cannabis 
after the onset of psychosis is associated with worse 
relapse 
outcome 
relative 
to 
non-users, 
whether 
discontinued use of cannabis subsequent to the onset of 
psychosis is associated with a similar relapse outcome 
compared to non-users, and whether discontinued use of 
cannabis is associated with a better relapse outcome 
compared with continued use. Furthermore, we 
investigated whether the eff
 ect of cannabis use on 
outcome was consistent across diff
 erent outcome 
measures by also examining the eff
 ect on measures such 
as length of admission to hospital, symptom severity, and 
level of functioning.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
We used a systematic search strategy to identify all 
relevant studies, following the methods recommended by 
the Cochrane Handbook35 and in accordance with the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.36 First, we searched 
the MEDLINE database for studies published in any 
language from the database inception date using a 
combination of search terms describing cannabis 
(“marijuana/marihuana”, “cannabis”, “illicit, substance”), 
the outcome of interest (“outcome, hospital*”, “relapse”, 
“readmission”), and the study population (“psycho*”, 
“bipolar”, “schizophrenia”), with the fi
 nal search done on 
April 21, 2015. After the database search, bibliographies of 
the identifi
 ed publications and previous published 
meta-analyses were hand-searched to identify additional 
studies that met the inclusion criteria but were missed by 
the database search. Studies were selected if they included 
a sample of patients with a pre-existing psychotic disorder 
(schizophrenia, schizoaff
 ective, or bipolar if outcome was 
reported as number of psychotic episodes),7 with a follow-
up duration of at least 6 months. The primary predictor 
variables7 were defi
 ned as continued cannabis use (yes or 
no) after onset of psychosis and discontinued cannabis 
use after onset (yes or no). Only a subset of the total pool 
of studies that examined the eff
 ect of continued cannabis 
use 
on 
outcome 
also 
examined 
the 
eff
 ect 
of 
discontinuation of the drug. We excluded studies if 
continued cannabis use (CC) or discontinued cannabis 
use (DC) could not be established (eg, studies38–41 that 
assessed cannabis use only around the onset of psychosis 
and studies42–45 that only reported lifetime cannabis use). 
The primary outcome was defi
 ned as relapse of psychosis, 
which was indexed as either readmission to hospital, 
investigator-established relapse (operationalised in this 
Article as a psychotic episode or exacerbation of psychotic 
symptoms),16,22,46 or investigator-established relapse with-
out any reported criteria for operationalisation.47 If the 
identifi
 ed studies reported symptom scores (positive or 
negative), length of time admitted to hospital, or level of 
functioning (as measured with the Global Assessment of 
Functioning Scale48) alongside the relapse information, 
this data was also extracted and used in separate outcome 
analyses.
Quality assessment and data extraction
We used a modifi
 ed seven-point strength-of-reporting 
scale, which has been used in previous meta-analyses 
done in a related topic of research.32,34 This scale is based 
on items describing methodological aspects in the 
Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in 
Epidemiology (STROBE)49 checklist. Studies with a score 
of more than 5 were classifi
 ed as higher quality studies 
(appendix).
An initial data extraction protocol was drafted in 2013 
and data extraction was piloted from studies identifi
 ed 
through a systematic search by at least two independent 
researchers (TS and RB) to fi
 nalise the selection criteria 
and variables of interest. Summary data were extracted 
by two independent researchers (TS and AM or MBS). In 
case of missing data, contact was made with the authors.

Disagreements were resolved through discussion 
between the researchers (TS and AM or MBS) extracting 
data and a senior researcher (SB).
Data analysis
Analyses were done with R and its package metaphor,50 
using random eff
 ects models (REM)51 that assume that 
eff
 ect sizes vary from study to study.52 Eff
 ect sizes were 
estimated using Cohen’s d, in which d values of 0·2 or 
lower represent small eff
 ects, d values between 0·4 and 
0·6 represent moderate eff
 ects, and d values of 0·8 or 
higher represent large eff
 ects.53 d per study was calculated 
for the following comparisons: continued cannabis use 
versus 
non-user 
(CC–NC), 
continued 
use 
versus 
discontinued use (CC–DC), and discontinued use versus 
non-user (DC–NC). We used the R package Compute.es,54

which allows data from included studies to be entered in 
the form of means and standard deviations (SD),37 p values 
for mean comparisons, or χ² statistics to reach an estimated 
d. Additionally, the package allowed the estimation of d for 
the studies that reported odds ratios.11,12 In cases in which 
the SD was not reported,55,56 the SD was extrapolated from 
other studies with similar outcome and sample 
characteristics. We carried out meta-regression analysis for 
categorical variables to compare the estimated ds between 
the groups CC–NC and DC–NC for outcome (relapse, 
length of time admitted to hospital, positive symptoms, 
negative symptoms, and functioning). We also used 
meta-regression to test whether the eff
 ect of cannabis was 
confounded by the stage of illness of participants in the 
studies included (ie, early psychosis versus chronic 
psychosis, with chronic psychosis referring to participants 
with an illness duration of more than 5 years, as classifi
 ed 
in previous studies57). Finally, we used meta-regression for 
continuous moderators to test the eff
 ect of sex (percentage 
of sample being male) and age at the time of study 
assessment. We examined the possibility of publication 
bias using funnel plots, followed by the Egger’s linear 
regression test58 to test funnel plot asymmetry for 
signifi
 cance. We tested homogeneity of the distribution of 
weighted eff
 ect sizes with the Q test, and degree of 
heterogeneity was quantifi
 ed using the I² test, which 
describes the percentage of observed heterogeneity that 
would not be expected by chance.59 I² values between 0% 
and 25% suggest small heterogeneity, whereas I² values in 
the range 25% and 50% suggest moderate heterogeneity, 
and those of more than 50% suggest large heterogeneity.
Because of the heterogeneity in the defi
 nition of relapse 
used by the studies, we carried out sensitivity analyses 
restricting the studies to only those investigating hospital 
admissions, which has been reported to be a valid 
measure of relapse in psychosis.60 Similarly, in view of 
the variation in follow-up duration between cannabis 
users and non-users in the studies, we carried out subset 
analyses by including only those studies in which 
cannabis users were matched to the non-users in terms 
of their follow-up duration (denoted as matched=yes if 
the diff
 erence was not more than 1 year between the 
groups).

published in languages other than English did not yield 
any additional studies meeting our inclusion criteria 
(appendix). Six of the included studies had an additional 
group of patients who were classifi
 ed as discontinued 
cannabis users (408 discontinued users, 268 continued 
users, and 496 non-users). Continued cannabis use after 
onset of illness was associated with a low-to-moderate 
increase in relapse of psychosis compared with non-users 
(dCC–NC=0·36, 95% CI 0·22 to 0·50, p<0·0001; fi
 gure 2, 
appendix). An eff
 ect of a similar magnitude was reported 
on length of time admitted to hospital after onset 
(dCC–NC=0·36, 0·13 to 0·58, p=0·02). For four studies 
(688 participants) we were able to calculate the number of 
days spent in hospital per year of illness since the onset of 
psychosis (estimated as the weighted mean diff
 erence 
[WMD]; appendix). The results suggest that cannabis 
users spent an additional 8·47 days (–4·56 to 21·50) in 
hospital per year of having psychosis, although this 
diff
 erence was not signifi
 cant (p=0·20), which might be 
attributable to the lack of power (appendix). In the seven 
studies (2298 participants) that examined the risk of 
relapse (table), the pooled odds were 1·97 (95% CI 1·46 to 
2·65, p<0·0001) times greater in people who continued to 
use cannabis than they were in those who did not use 
cannabis. Limiting analysis to include only the six  studies 
(n=1172) that reported on relapse rates in individuals with 
the three patterns of cannabis use of interest in this 
context (ie, CC, DC, and NC) showed that this adverse 
eff
 ect of cannabis in continued users remained when 
compared with those who discontinued (dCC–DC=0·28, 
0·12 to 0·44, p=0·0005). By contrast, individuals who 
discontinued cannabis use did not signifi
 cantly diff
 er 
from the non-users in their relapse outcome (dDC–NC=0·02, 
–0·12 to 0·15; p=0·82, fi
 gure 3). Including all identifi
 ed 
studies in meta-regression to compare the diff
 erence in 
eff
 ect size d between continued cannabis users and those 
who discontinued relative to corresponding non-user 
groups (dCC–NC=0·36 vs dDC–NC=0·02) confi
 rmed that the 
eff
 ect sizes were signifi
 cantly diff
 erent between the two 
sets of comparisons (p=0·04; appendix). Egger’s test and 
funnel plots (appendix) suggest evidence of funnel plot 
asymmetry for relapse (p=0·0002), but the trim-and-fi
 ll 
method (R₀ estimator used for estimating the number of 
missing studies) did not show missing studies, suggesting 
that the asymmetry might be due to other causes such as 
study heterogeneity.77,78
Continued cannabis use predicted positive symptom 
severity 
(dCC–NC=0·15, 
95% 
CI 
0·01 
to 
0·29, 
p=0·04; fi
 gure 4). These small but signifi
 cant adverse 
eff
 ects on positive symptoms were not present in 
participants 
who 
discontinued 
using 
cannabis 
(dDC–NC=–0·30, –0·99 to 0·38, p=0·39) and meta-regression 
suggested that the eff
 ect sizes (dCC–NC vs dDC–NC) were 
diff
 erent (p=0·05). Notably, although continued cannabis 
users showed similar levels of functioning when 
compared with the non-users (dCC–NC=0·04, –0·14 to 0·21, 
p=0·68), those who discontinued using cannabis had 
higher levels of functioning than did non-users 
(dDC–NC=–0·49, –0·81 to –0·17, p=0·002). This diff
 erence 
in eff
 ect-size (dCC–NC vs dDC–NC) was signifi
 cant, as shown by 
meta-regression (p=0·0075). Continued cannabis use 
was not a signifi
 cant predictor for the presence of 
negative symptoms (dCC–NC=–0·09, –0·30 to 0·11, p=0·37) 
or reduction in negative symptoms in individuals who 
discontinued use compared with non-users (dDC–NC –0·31, 
–0·67 to 0·05, p=0·10); the diff
 erence in eff
 ect size 
(dCC–NC vs dDC–NC) was not signifi
 cant by meta-regression 
(p=0·41). This fi
 nding is in accordance with the direct 
comparison between continued and discontinued users 
(CC–DC; appendix), which suggested that individuals 
who continued smoking cannabis had higher levels of 
negative symptoms than did those who discontinued. 
However, this association was not signifi
 cant (p=0·07) 
and generalisability might be restricted owing to the few 
studies included in this analysis (two studies, n=83).
We noted substantial heterogeneity in the eff
 ect of 
continued cannabis use on relapse (83·62%, 95% CI 
68·04–92·89, p<0·0001). Hence, we did sensitivity 
analyses with more homogeneous groups of studies 
(appendix); studies were selected if they matched the 
follow-up duration between continued cannabis users 
and non-users (17 studies, n=15 371; dCC–NC=0·42, 95% CI 
0·26–0·57, p<0·0001), were rated as high quality 
(ten studies, n=1366; dCC–NC=0·50, 0·32–0·68, p<0·0001),

if they included either only early stage psychosis 
(ten studies, n=1120; dCC–NC=0·30, 0·13–0·47, p=0·0004)

admission (19 studies, n=15 412; dCC–NC=0·36, 0·19–0·52, 
p<0·0001). Eff

only patients with non-aff
 ective psychosis (nine studies, 
n=1280; dCC–NC=0·34, 0·11–0·58, p=0·0036) and those 
including only aff
 ective psychosis (15 studies, n=14 877; 
dCC–NC=0·37, 0·19–0·55, p<0·0001) were not diff
 erent 
(p=0·89). Sex  and age at follow-up assessment did not 
reduce the heterogeneity in relapse outcome, as shown 
by meta-regression (sex p=0·87 and age p=0·38).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the fi
 rst meta-analysis to show 
that, irrespective of the stage of their psychotic disorder, 
patients who continue using cannabis are more likely to 
have a psychosis relapsing course than are both 
non-using patients (dCC–NC=0·36) and patients who 
discontinue using cannabis after onset of psychosis 
(dCC–DC=0·28). Furthermore, because individuals who 
discontinue cannabis use did not diff
 er from the non-
users in their relapse outcome (dDC–NC=0·02), these results 
suggest that the increased relapse rate associated with 
cannabis use might resolve after discontinuation of its 
use. The gradient in the eff
 ect of cannabis use (continued 
use is worse than discontinued use, which is worse than 
non-use) on outcome in psychosis recorded in the 
present analysis is consistent with that noted in other 
studies15,24 not included here, with the eff
 ect on outcome 
being most adverse in people who continue to use the 
drug. This fi
 nding is also compatible with epidemiological 
evidence13,65 of the adverse eff
 ects of cannabis being dose 
dependent and with evidence that the magnitude of 
cognitive impairments associated with cannabis exposure

tend to diminish after abstinence.79 Additionally, our 
results suggest that continued cannabis users underwent 
substantially longer admissions to hospital after their 
psychosis onset than did non-users (dCC–NC=0·36), which 
could suggest that more severe relapses require longer 
inpatient care to become stabilised. Increased hospital 
stay might also be linked to factors unrelated to the 
severity of the illness, such as absence of suitable 
accommodation for the patient after discharge.
In terms of symptomatic outcome, continued cannabis 
users experienced more severe positive psychotic 
symptoms at follow-up assessment. This eff
 ect was not 
present in patients who discontinued using cannabis 
(dCC–NC=0·15 vs dCC–DC=–0·30). This result is consistent with 
other follow-up studies22-25 that compared positive 
symptom levels between continued users, discontinued 
users, and non-users of cannabis and a report80 from a 
longitudinal population-based sample suggesting that 
continuation of cannabis use predicted subsequent 
persistence of psychotic symptoms. Other studies have 
reported a temporal association between changes in 
cannabis use and subsequent changes in psychotic 
symptom severity, in both the short-term81 and long-term.14 
Evidence that cannabis use has a particularly harmful 
eff
 ect on diff
 erent outcome measures of psychosis (eg, 
relapse and psychotic symptoms) when it is continued 
compared with when it is stopped is intuitive and 
consistent with eff
 ects of cannabis use on cognition.79 
However, the eff
 ect of cannabis and continuity of its use 
was not noted across other outcomes in the present meta-
analysis; continued cannabis users did not diff
 er from 
individuals in the non-user group in their negative 
symptoms (dCC–NC=–0·09, p=0·37). A similar result was 
reported in a separate meta-analysis focusing on 
symptoms.32 Discontinued cannabis users also did not 
diff
 er from non-users (dDC–NC=–0·31, p=0·10), although 
they had fewer negative symptoms when compared 
directly with continued users (dCC–DC=0·41, p=0·07). This 
fi
 nding might seem to contradict the results of the meta-
regression that suggest no diff
 erence between the eff
 ects 
of continued and discontinued use on negative symptoms. 
However, the meta-regression compared the estimates 
from two diff
 erent random eff
 ects models (ie, dCC–NC and 
dDC–NC) examining the eff
 ect on negative symptoms, rather 
than doing a direct comparison between discontinued and 
continued cannabis users. Furthermore, the direct 
comparison included data from only two studies, whereas 
the meta-regression compared data from a larger sample 
of studies. Nevertheless, the general direction of eff
 ect in 
diff
 erent groups is consistent across all comparisons. 
Continued cannabis users showed similar levels of 
functioning when compared with non-users (dCC–NC=0·04, 
p=0·68), 
whereas 
discontinued 
users 
had 
better 
functioning 
scores 
than 
non-users 
(dDC–NC=–0·49, 
p=0·002). In line with this fi
 nding, other studies22,24-26 have 
reported that individuals who discontinue cannabis use 
have better functioning than non-users and a 2012 
meta-analysis34 suggested that cessation of substance use 
in general was associated with improvement of negative 
symptoms and global  functioning as measured with the 
Global Assessment of Functioning Scale.48 These fi
 ndings 
suggest that patients who use cannabis might have better 
functioning to begin with (although this hypothesis is not 
something that could be tested in the present analysis). 
This result is also compatible with the view that patients 
who use cannabis represent a subgroup of people with a 
less neurodevelopmental pathology;82,83 perhaps for this 
reason the adverse eff
 ects of cannabis use on functioning 
and negative symptoms become apparent only when 
continued users are compared with those who 
discontinued use rather than non-users. Patients who are 
able to stop using cannabis might represent a causally and 
clinically distinct subgroup with a less severe illness with 
less of a need to use cannabis for self-medication.
The reported association between cannabis exposure 
and relapse of psychosis and related outcome variables 
might be mediated through the eff
 ect of its key 
psychoactive ingredient, THC, on the neural substrates 
implicated in psychosis.18–20,84–86 The reported strength of 
association between continued cannabis use and relapse 
is similar to other identifi
 ed environmental risk factors 
for relapse of psychosis, such as highly expressed 
emotions (d=0·31),87 and the eff
 ects of interventions that 
prevent relapse, such as psychoeducation (d=0·21),88 or 
reduce psychotic symptoms, such as antipsychotic 
treatment (d=0·48).89 Hence, these results emphasise the 
importance of cannabis use as a clinically relevant target 
for treatment development.
Some limitations, which are mainly related to the 
methodological heterogeneity in the studies included 
(table), are noteworthy. Diff
 erent criteria were used by the 
studies included in this meta-analysis to classify people 
who continued to use cannabis (eg presence of cannabis 
use disorder or use more than once in a defi
 ned time-
period), those who discontinued the drug (eg, history of 
use, but negative urinary drug screen or no use in defi
 ned 
time period), and non-users (eg, less than daily use, 
non-misuser, no use in defi
 ned time period, or never 
use). Follow-up durations also diff
 ered between cannabis 
users and non-users in some studies66 (eg, 7-year relapse 
window for cannabis users vs 12-year relapse window for 
non-users). Exclusion of studies with diff
 ering follow-up 
windows between the participant groups as part of 
sensitivity analysis showed a slightly larger eff
 ect of 
cannabis use on relapse than that reported in the main 
analysis (d=0·42 vs d=0·36). The study by Baeza and 
colleagues,26 might need to be emphasised in this context, 
considering that their report of absence of adverse eff
 ects 
of cannabis use on relapse might be attributable to their 
6 months follow-up, an interval perhaps too short to 
detect diff
 erences in relapse rates between the groups.
The patients might have diff
 ered in their stage of 
illness across the included studies (eg, early stage vs 
chronic psychosis), but sensitivity analysis showed that

223
this discrepancy did not signifi
 cantly aff
 ect the results. 
We could not control for the eff
 ect of other potential 
confounding factors that might be associated with 
cannabis use, such as medication adherence,1,24,25,67,69 
engagement with services,24 or misuse of other drugs.1 
However, the present results are consistent with studies 
that have systematically controlled for age, sex, alcohol 
and drug use, illness characteristics (eg duration, 
diagnosis, and severity), and medication adherence when 
measuring the eff
 ect of cannabis use on relapse.10–12 
Another limitation inherent to the meta-analytical design 
relates to our inability to analyse raw data, which 
restricted our ability to do moderation analysis to directly 
test for more defi
 ned dose–response patterns such as 
frequency, duration, or age of onset of use or type of 
cannabis consumed, factors that are also likely to 
moderate the eff
 ect of cannabis on relapse.13,65 A further 
potential source of heterogeneity might be the use of 
diff
 erent 
types 
of 
cannabis 
containing 
diff
 ering 
proportions of the main ingredients (such as THC or 
cannabidiol) that are known to have opposing eff
 ects.90 
We were unable to assess the eff
 ect of type of cannabis 
used because this information was not available for the 
included studies. Finally, although our systematic search 
might have been somewhat restricted by using MEDLINE 
only, we aimed to address this potential limitation by 
screening bibliographies from previously done meta-
analyses, systematic reviews, and original studies for 
additional studies that might have been missed in the 
database search.
Despite the absence of more fi
 ne-grained measures, 
this meta-analysis detected a fairly robust pooled eff
 ect 
of continued cannabis exposure on relapse outcome and 
other measures suggestive of adverse outcome, which 
were absent in those who discontinued use of the drug. 
The fact that the eff
 ects of continued use of cannabis or 
its discontinuation are consistent across diff
 erent 
measures of outcome underlines the importance of 
addressing continued cannabis use in patients with 
psychosis in the clinical setting, by emphasising that 
outcomes are likely to be better in those who discontinue 
the drug.
