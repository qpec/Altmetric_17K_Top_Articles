Purpose
The aim of this nationwide, register-based cohort study was to determine whether women treated
for depression before primary early-stage breast cancer are at increased risk for receiving treatment
that is not in accordance with national guidelines and for poorer survival.
Material and Methods
We identified 45,325 women with early breast cancer diagnosed in Denmark from 1998 to 2011. Of
these, 744 women (2%) had had a previous hospital contact (as an inpatient or outpatient) for
depression and another 6,068 (13%) had been treated with antidepressants. Associations between
previous treatment of depression and risk of receiving nonguideline treatment of breast cancer were
assessed in multivariable logistic regression analyses. We compared the overall survival, breast
cancer–specific survival, and risk of death by suicide of women who were and were not treated for
depression before breast cancer in multivariable Cox regression analyses.
Results
Tumor stage did not indicate a delay in diagnosis of breast cancer in women previously treated for
depression; however, those given antidepressants before breast cancer had a significantly in-
creased risk of receiving nonguideline treatment (odds ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.27) and sig-
nificantly worse overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.28) and breast cancer–specific
survival (hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.20). Increased but nonsignificant estimated risks were
also found for women with previous hospital contacts for depression. In subgroup analyses, the
association of depression with poor survival was particularly strong among women who did not
receive the indicated adjuvant systemic therapy.
Conclusion
Women previously treated for depression constitute a large subgroup of patients with breast cancer
who are at risk for receiving nonguideline breast cancer treatment, which probably contributes to
poorer overall and breast cancer–specific survival.

INTRODUCTION
The
hypothesized
association
between
de-
pression and poor survival after breast cancer
has been studied previously1-7; however, some of
the studies were limited by low statistical
power1,2,4,7 or did not include clinical variables,5
and the design of others did not allow ascer-
tainment of the direction of the hypothesized
associations between depression and poor breast
cancer prognosis.4,6 The latter is a crucial
question, because impending death has been
found to increase depressive symptoms and use
of antidepressants in patients with cancer.8,9 We
showed previously that the number of tumor-
positive axillary lymph nodes predicts the risk
for treatment of depression after a breast cancer
diagnosis.10
One way of addressing the clinically relevant
question of whether women with depression are
a vulnerable patient group that does not receive
optimal breast cancer treatment and thus have
poor survival is to identify women with depression
before diagnosis of breast cancer. To our knowledge,
only three such studies have been reported11-13;
however, one included only women with breast
cancer diagnosed at the age of 67 years or older,
limiting the generalizability of results,12 and the
other two did not address breast cancer–specific
survival or whether depression was associated with

 receiving nonguideline treatment.11,13 The aim of this study was to
determine whether prior depression is associated with breast cancer
treatment according to national guidelines, with overall survival, with
breast cancer–specific survival, and with death by suicide among
women with early-stage breast cancer.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
We conducted a nationwide cohort study, using registers that cover all
residents of Denmark and the unique personal identification number
assigned to all Danish residents, which ensures accurate linkage among
registers.14
Data Sources
Since 1977, the Danish Breast Cancer Group (DBCG) has issued
successive national guidelines for diagnosing and treating breast cancer.15
The Group also manages a clinical database that contains detailed indi-
vidual information on more than 95% of histopathologically verified breast
cancers diagnosed in Denmark and their treatment.15 From this register,
we obtained the date of breast cancer diagnosis, defined as the date of
primary surgery or biopsy if primary surgery was not performed. We
classified patients with locally advanced and distant metastases as having
late-stage disease; all other breast cancers were classified as early stage.
Furthermore, we obtained information on menopausal status, tumor
size, number of tumor-positive axillary lymph nodes, estrogen receptor
status, type of surgery, and allocation to adjuvant systemic therapy
according to the DBCG guidelines. For women allocated to guideline
treatment, we obtained information on type of adjuvant systemic therapy
indicated according to the guidelines and type of adjuvant systemic
therapy initiated. In the DBCG database, women with the best prognosis
are classified as having low-risk breast cancer, and guideline treatment of
these women does not involve adjuvant systemic therapy. Finally, we
determined breast cancer stage on the basis of tumor size and number of
tumor-positive axillary lymph nodes.16 From the Danish Cancer Reg-
istry, we obtained the date of diagnosis of all cancers diagnosed from
1943 to 2011.17
The Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register contains data on all
admissions to Danish psychiatric inpatient facilities since 1969 and in-
formation on outpatient contacts since 1995.18 We identified the dates of
admission for all inpatient and outpatient hospital contacts from 1969 to
2011 with valid diagnoses of unipolar depression19,20 (International
Classification of Disease, 8th revision [ICD-8]: 296.09, 296.29 or ICD, 10th
revision [ICD-10]: F32-F33) and other major psychiatric disorders, de-
fined as organic mental disorder, mental or behavioral disorder due to use
of a psychoactive substance, schizophrenia, schizotypal or delusional
disorder, or manic or bipolar episodes (ICD-8: 290-295.99, 296.19, 296.39,
303.00-304.99, and ICD-10: F00-F31).
The dates of redemption of all prescriptions for antidepressants
(group N06A of the Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical classification system)
from 1995 to 2011 were obtained from the Danish National Prescription
Registry.21 In Denmark, antidepressants are available by prescription only,
and all drugs redeemed with a prescription at Danish pharmacies have
been registered since 1995.
Individual information on highest level of attained education is
registered in the Population Education Register,22 which is updated an-
nually on October 1; we also obtained information on the educational level
in the year preceding a diagnosis of breast cancer. Educational level was
categorized as basic school/high school, vocational training, higher edu-
cation, and unknown.
From the Civil Registration System, we obtained the dates of mi-
gration from 1973 to 2011 and cohabitation status as of January 1 in the
year of breast cancer diagnosis. Patients were categorized as living alone or
with a spouse.14
Information on comorbid conditions was obtained from the Danish
Patient Registry for 1978 to 2011.23 We calculated a Charlson Comorbidity
Index score24 for each woman at the time of diagnosis of breast cancer, as
0, 1, or $ 2, not including breast cancer.
In the Danish Register of Causes of Death, we obtained the dates and
causes of all deaths in our study population through 2011.25 Breast cancer
(ICD-10: C50) and suicide (ICD-10: X60-X84 + Y870) were identified as
specific causes of death.26
Study Population
Our study population comprised women residing in Denmark with
primary, unilateral breast cancer diagnosed between April 1, 1998, and
December 31, 2011. We excluded women with previous cancer (except
nonmelanoma skin cancer) or previous major psychiatric disorders (ex-
cept unipolar depression). To ensure identification of use of antidepres-
sants, we excluded women who had not lived continuously in Denmark for
3 years and 3 months before diagnosis of breast cancer. Furthermore,
women for whom dates of migration, birth, breast cancer, and death
conflicted among registers were excluded. Finally, we excluded women
with late-stage breast cancer, because they were treated according to
different guidelines from those for early-stage breast cancer (Fig 1).
To identify the most severe treated cases of depression, we retrieved all
hospital contacts for unipolar depression from 3 months before diagnosis
of breast cancer dating back to 1969. In addition, as a more inclusive measure
of treated depression, we identified treatment with antidepressants from
3 months before diagnosis of breast cancer and 3 years previously. Ac-
cordingly, we classified women at diagnosis of breast cancer as (1) having had
no hospital contact for depression and no pharmacologic treatment of
depression before breast cancer, (2) having been treated with antidepressants
but with no hospital contact for depression before breast cancer, or (3)
having had a hospital contact for depression before breast cancer.
Statistical Analyses
Differences in sociodemographic variables, tumor characteristics,
and breast cancer treatment were evaluated in x2 tests and by analysis of
variance. We analyzed differences in risk for unfavorable selection for
adjuvant systemic therapy according to previous treatment of depression
using multivariable logistic regression models that included sociodemo-
graphic and clinical variables.
We plotted cumulative breast cancer–specific mortality with death
from other causes as a competing risk and used Gray’s test for differences
between groups with adjustment for age in 5-year strata. We used mul-
tivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models to evaluate dif-
ferences in overall survival, breast cancer–specific survival, and risk of
death by suicide according to previous treatment of depression. Socio-
demographic and clinical covariables were added stepwise in four in-
creasingly comprehensive models.
Finally, we used multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression
models for six analyses of breast cancer–specific survival separately for (1)
women not allocated to treatment according to the guidelines of the
DBCG,15 (2) women with low-risk breast cancer, (3) women with high-risk
breast cancer not given adjuvant systemic therapy according to the
guidelines, (4) women given chemotherapy, (5) women given chemo-
therapy and endocrine therapy, and (6) women given endocrine therapy
only.
In all Cox models, women were followed from the date of breast
cancer diagnosis until death; emigration; hospital contact for a major
psychiatric disorder (organic mental disorders, mental disorders due to
psychoactive substance use, schizophrenia and related disorders, bipolar
disorder; ICD-10: F00–F31); a new primary cancer; or December 31, 2011,
whichever came first. After assessment of linearity, age and calendar year
were included as continuous variables in all models, when possible. To
evaluate the assumption of proportionality, we visually assessed plots of log
minus log of the survival density functions versus log of follow-up time; all
Cox models were stratified on variables that violated the assumption of

 proportionality. Characteristics at diagnosis of breast cancer were analyzed
and logistic regressions and Cox regressions were performed with the
FREQ, UNIVARIATE, LOGISTIC, and PHREG procedures in SAS (version
9.3; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Cumulative incidence was analyzed with the
cmprsk package in R (version 3.1.2; R Foundation, Vienna, Austria).27,28
RESULTS
After exclusions, our study population consisted of 45,325 womenwith
primary early-stage breast cancer, of whom 6,068 (13%) had pre-
viously used antidepressants and 744 (2%) had had a hospital contact
for depression (Fig 1). Compared with women who had not used
antidepressants before breast cancer, those with a previous hospital
contact for depression or who had used antidepressants were statis-
tically significantly likely to be older, have less education, live alone,
have comorbid somatic disease, and have breast cancer diagnosed in
later calendar years (Table 1). More women who had used antide-
pressants received only a biopsy and not surgery and were therefore
more likely to have unknown tumor size, number of tumor-positive
axillary lymph nodes, and estrogen receptor status. Statistically sig-
nificantly fewer women who had used antidepressants were allocated
to guideline systemic adjuvant therapy. After diagnosis of breast cancer,
80% of women previously treated for depression used antidepressants,
whereas 23% of women not previously treated for depression initiated
use of antidepressants after the diagnosis of breast cancer.
Allocation to and Initiation of Guideline Adjuvant
Systemic Therapy
The multivariable logistic regression analyses with socio-
demographic and clinical covariables showed a significantly increased
odds ratio (OR) that women who had used antidepressants were not
allocated to guideline breast cancer treatment (OR, 1.14; 95% CI,
1.03 to 1.27; Fig 2). For women with a previous hospital contact for
depression, we observed elevated ORs for not being allocated to
guideline breast cancer treatment (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.77)
and being classified as having low-risk breast cancer (OR, 1.24; 95%
CI, 0.98 to 1.58); these estimates did not reach statistical significance.
For the 30,829 women with high-risk breast cancer, we found no
differences in initiation of guideline adjuvant systemic therapy.
Cumulative Breast Cancer–Specific Mortality
Women who had used antidepressants before breast cancer
had a significantly higher cumulative breast cancer–specific
mortality rate than did those who had not (Fig 3; Gray’s test:
P = .002). Thus, 13% of women who had used antidepressants and
11% of those who had not had died of breast cancer 5 years after
diagnosis. There was no difference in cumulative breast cancer–
specific mortality between women with a previous hospital contact
for depression and women who had not used antidepressants
(Fig 3; Gray’s test: P = .32).
Overall Survival, Breast Cancer–Specific Survival, and
Death by Suicide
In all models, women who had used antidepressants had
worse overall survival (fully adjusted model: hazard ratio [HR],
1.21; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.28) and worse breast cancer–specific
survival (fully adjusted model: HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.20; Table 2).
Addition of educational level, cohabitation, and comorbidity score
slightly attenuated the risks of overall and breast cancer–specific

 survival, but the estimates were robust to the addition of clinical
and treatment variables. We found significantly increased HRs for
death by suicide for both women who had used antidepressants
(fully adjusted model: HR, 5.38; 95% CI, 2.16 to 13.37) and
women with a previous hospital contact for depression (fully
adjusted model: HR, 19.81; 95% CI, 5.32 to 73.86).
In the subgroup analysis of women with high-risk breast
cancer who did not receive adjuvant systemic therapy according
to the guidelines, we found statistically significantly worse sur-
vival of women who had used antidepressants (HR, 1.51; 95% CI,
1.26 to 1.82) and nonsignificantly worse survival of women with
a previous hospital contact for depression (HR, 1.57; 95% CI,
0.99 to 2.49; Table 3). Among women who received guideline
adjuvant systemic therapy, we found no statistically significant
difference in breast cancer–specific survival.
DISCUSSION
In this nationwide study, we found an increased risk of not re-
ceiving relevant breast cancer treatment and poorer overall and
breast cancer–specific survival among women with depression. We
were reassured, however, that the survival of women with previous
depression was similar to that of women without depression if they

 received adjuvant treatment according to the guidelines. Our access
to national registers with high coverage and valid, detailed in-
formation on sociodemographic variables, tumor characteristics,
adjuvant systemic therapy, and cause of death provided the basis
for these novel, clinically important results.
Our finding that women previously treated for depression
are at increased risk for not receiving guideline breast cancer
treatment indicates the potential for improvement of breast
cancer treatment of a large, vulnerable group of patients.
Goodwin et al12 reported similar findings in a population of
patients with breast cancer $ 67 years of age, whereas our results
relate to women of all ages.
We had expected that women with previous depression or use
of antidepressants would present with more advanced disease
characteristics, reflecting diagnostic delay. However, this study does
not indicate that the poorer prognosis of patients with breast
cancer with previous depression can be explained by more ad-
vanced disease at diagnosis, in line with a previous report.12
Two other population-based studies of survival after breast

 2% with previous hospitalization for depression in our pop-
ulation. We found similarly poor survival in the much larger
group of women with previous use of antidepressants (corre-
sponding to 13%), indicating that poorer survival is not re-
stricted to a small subgroup of women with the most severe
depression but affects a large subgroup of patients on oncologic
wards.
The significantly increased estimated risk for breast cancer–
specific death in this study was lower than that reported by
Goodwin et al.12 This may be related to the full coverage of breast
cancer treatment by the free medical care offered to all residents
of Denmark, whereas the Medicare setting studied by Goodwin
et al12 involves high costs for adjuvant cancer treatment, po-
tentially discouraging some patients from receiving optimal
cancer treatment.29
The Cox regression analyses were robust to the addition of
type of adjuvant systemic therapy as a potential mediator of es-
timated differences in overall and breast cancer–specific survival.
However, subgroup analyses demonstrated that previous de-
pression was associated with poor breast cancer–specific survival,
especially among women not given the indicated adjuvant systemic
therapy, whereas no difference was found for women who initiated
guideline adjuvant systemic therapy. Somatic comorbid conditions
have also been associated with poor breast cancer prognosis.30
However, the prognosis of patients with breast cancer with somatic
or psychiatric comorbidity who receive the breast cancer treatment
they need according to the guidelines was similar to that of patients
without comorbidity. The necessary measures should therefore be
taken to increase enrollment and completion31 of guideline ad-
juvant therapy in women with depression.
The association found in this study between previously treated
depression and worse survival after breast cancer must be inter-
preted in relation to the generally increased mortality among
people with depression.32 Accordingly, women previously treated
for depression had a higher burden of severe somatic comorbidity;
however, our estimates of worse overall survival and breast cancer–
specific survival remained statistically significant after adjustment in
the analyses for this factor as a proxy for general somatic health. We
therefore suggest that the worse survival after breast cancer of women
with previously treated depression is related not only to an increased
risk of death before diagnosis of breast cancer but also to the breast
cancer per se.
Although we observed an increased HR for suicide among
women with previously treated depression, we consider that this
reflects a difference in risk that was present before the diagnosis of
breast cancer. Thus, the rate of suicide in our population was
approximately 10 per 100,000 person-years (Table 2), which
is comparable to the rate in the total Danish female population

 . 30 years of age in the same period.33 Furthermore, the increased
HR for death by suicide found among women who had a hospital
contact for depression is similar to that in a recent study including
the total Swedish population.34
Our study has some limitations. As in the three previous
studies,11-13 our data on depression were derived from registers,
which did not allow identification of women with undiagnosed or
untreated depression or women with depression who received
psychotherapy only. Furthermore, although depression is the in-
dication for most prescribed antidepressants, other conditions,
such as anxiety and pain, might account for more than 25% of
prescribed antidepressants.35-37 In addition, although we adjusted
for a range of comorbid diseases related to unhealthy lifestyles, our
analyses, like those in previous studies,11-13 were not directly
adjusted for lifestyle factors, such as smoking and alcohol use,
which might mediate the observed associations. Furthermore, in
Denmark, autopsy is conducted in only 10% of deaths.25 Con-
sequently, cause of death is often a qualified guess on the basis of
the preceding course of illness, inevitably leading to some mis-
classification in registration. Because most deaths attributed to
breast cancer occur after a diagnosis of late-stage disease or re-
currence, we assume that misclassification of breast cancer as the
cause of death is limited. Finally, relatively few patients (n = 744)
had a previous hospital contact for depression, decreasing the
statistical power of these analyses.
In conclusion, in a nationwide cohort study of women with
primary early-stage breast cancer, we found that women treated for
depression before the breast cancer diagnosis were at greater risk
for not initiating guideline adjuvant systemic therapy, which
probably partly explains the modest but significant increased risks
of death and of breast cancer–specific death in this group. Our
findings underline the importance of identifying women with
previous depression to increase initiation of adjuvant systemic
breast cancer therapy and of following up such women carefully to
identify depressive relapse, nonadherence to breast cancer therapy,
and suicidal ideation.
