Post-marketing withdrawal of anti-obesity
medicinal products because of adverse
drug reactions: a systematic review
Igho J. Onakpoya1*, Carl J. Heneghan2 and Jeffrey K. Aronson1
Abstract
Background: We identified anti-obesity medications withdrawn since 1950 because of adverse drug reactions after
regulatory approval, and examined the evidence used to support such withdrawals, investigated the mechanisms of
the adverse reactions, and explored the trends over time.
Methods: We conducted searches in PubMed, the World Health Organization database of drugs, the websites of
drug regulatory authorities, and selected full texts, and we hand searched references in retrieved documents. We
included anti-obesity medications that were withdrawn between 1950 and December 2015 and assessed the levels
of evidence used for making withdrawal decisions using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine criteria.
Results: We identified 25 anti-obesity medications withdrawn between 1964 and 2009; 23 of these were centrally
acting, via monoamine neurotransmitters. Case reports were cited as evidence for withdrawal in 80% of instances.
Psychiatric disturbances, cardiotoxicity (mainly attributable to re-uptake inhibitors), and drug abuse or dependence
(mainly attributable to neurotransmitter releasing agents) together accounted for 83% of withdrawals. Deaths were
reportedly associated with seven products (28%). In almost half of the cases, the withdrawals occurred within
2 years of the first report of an adverse reaction.
Conclusions: Most of the drugs that affect monoamine neurotransmitters licensed for the treatment of obesity
over the past 65 years have been withdrawn because of adverse reactions. The reasons for withdrawal raise
concerns about the wisdom of using pharmacological agents that target monoamine neurotransmitters in
managing obesity. Greater transparency in the assessment of harms from anti-obesity medications is therefore
warranted.

Background
The prevalence of corpulence and obesity has more than
tripled in the last decade [1], giving rise to substantially
increased healthcare costs [2, 3]. According to the
World Health Organization (WHO), corpulence and
obesity are the fifth leading cause of mortality worldwide
[4]. Strategies to reduce weight include diet and lifestyle
adjustments, behavioural techniques, and drug therapy
[5]; however, they have had little effect on the growing
obesity epidemic.
Modern drug therapy for obesity treatment began in
1933 with the use of 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP), a
thermogenic agent, for weight reduction [6]. However,
its use was associated with serious adverse reactions,
and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
banned it in 1938 [7]. In the late 1930s, drugs acting on
monoamine neurotransmitters, prescribed as appetite
suppressants, were introduced [8]. One such drug,
Hydrin (amphetamine), gained FDA approval under con-
troversial circumstances, because the FDA’s then acting
medical director served as a consultant to the Council
on Pharmacy and Chemistry of the American Medical
Association (AMA) [9]. The council later withdrew its
approval of Hydrin, citing lack of evidence on harms

 [10]. This was followed by the development of other
anti-obesity medications, mainly congeners of amphet-
amine and monoamine re-uptake inhibitors [11].
In recent years, there has been a growing focus on the
development of novel therapies for the treatment of
obesity [12], including drug combinations, a few of
which have recently gained marketing approvals from
regulatory authorities [13].
However, at the same time several anti-obesity prod-
ucts have been withdrawn from the market after ap-
proval because of adverse reactions [14]. To date, the
patterns of and reasons for withdrawal of anti-obesity
products have not been systematically analysed. There-
fore, our objectives were to identify anti-obesity prod-
ucts withdrawn from the market because of adverse
reactions, to examine the evidence used for withdrawals,
determine the mechanism through which the adverse re-
actions occurred, and explore the patterns in withdrawal
over time.
Methods
Search strategy
We searched for anti-obesity medications that had been
withdrawn from the market after regulatory approval
because of adverse drug reactions between 1950 and
December 2015 from the following sources:
� WHO database of Consolidated List of Products
whose consumption and/or sale have been banned,
withdrawn, severely restricted, or not approved by
governments (issues 6, 8, 12, and 14)
� Regulatory news sections of WHO Drug
Information (volumes 1–29)
� WHO Pharmaceuticals Newsletter (1997–2015)
� UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency (MHRA) website
� US FDA website
� Database of withdrawn drugs of the European
Medicines Agency (EMA)
For each withdrawn anti-obesity medicine identified,
we searched the following sources for the first reported
adverse
drug
reaction:
PubMed,
Medline,
Google
Scholar, Meyler’s Side Effects of Drugs and the Side Ef-
fects of Drugs Annuals 1–36, and Stephens' Detection of
New Adverse Drug Reactions, 5th edition. Search terms
used included “anti-obesity”, “withdrawal”, “fatal*”, “ad-
verse reaction”, “adverse event”, “toxicity”, “voluntary re-
call”, “suspension”, “prohibition”, “banned”, “remov*”,
“revoke*”, and “discontinued”. (See Additional file 1 for
extended search lists of websites and other sources
accessed, together with search strategies used for search-
ing scientific databases.) If we could not find informa-
tion for an anti-obesity medication when using its
chemical name for searches, we used trade or code
names. We also hand searched references in retrieved
full texts for earlier reports of adverse reactions. If an
article contained information about an earlier reported
date, that date was chosen as the first adverse reaction
date. If an anti-obesity medicine was withdrawn because
of two or more adverse reactions, we used the date of
the first reported reaction.
Inclusion/exclusion criteria
To be included in the review, an anti-obesity medicinal
product must have been withdrawn from the market be-
cause of reports of suspected adverse reaction(s) or
problems related to hazards or harms. We excluded
anti-obesity medicines for which there was documented
regulatory evidence that they had been voluntarily with-
drawn by marketing authorization holders (MAHs)
solely for commercial reasons. We also excluded herbal,
non-human, and non-prescription medicines (i.e. medi-
cines that were not approved via the conventional re-
gulatory pathway for drug licensing) used as weight loss
products.
Assessing the types of evidence
We documented the highest level of available evidence
before the year of first withdrawal of anti-obesity medi-
cines, based on the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based
Medicine (OCEBM) criteria [15], which rank the levels
of evidence of harms as follows: Level 1, systematic re-
view (highest); Level 2, randomized clinical trial; Level 3,
non-randomized cohort or follow-up studies; Level 4, case-
series or case-control studies; and Level 5, mechanism-
based reasoning (lowest). One reviewer (IJO) documented
the levels of evidence, which were independently verified
by a second reviewer (JKA). Disagreements were resolved
through discussion.
Data extraction
For each withdrawn anti-obesity product, we extracted
data on the marketing authorization or launch date (or
the date of first recorded use); the drug class, mechan-
ism of action, and therapeutic indication(s) [16]; the year
an adverse reaction related to the reason for withdrawal
was first reported; the year of first withdrawal; the coun-
try or countries of withdrawal; and the reported mech-
anism by which the drug caused the adverse reaction.
One reviewer (IJO) extracted the data, and a second re-
viewer (JKA) verified them independently. Discrepancies
were resolved by discussion.
Statistical analyses
We used summary tables to document the intervals be-
tween launch year and the year of first report of an ad-
verse drug reaction, the interval between launch year
Onakpoya et al. BMC Medicine  (2016) 14:191 
Page 2 of 11
 and the year of first withdrawal, and the interval be-
tween the first report of an adverse drug reaction and
the year of first withdrawal. Because these intervals were
skewed, we used medians and interquartile ranges
(IQRs). We also compared intervals to reports of adverse
reactions and withdrawals between products based on
their mechanistic actions. Fisher’s exact test was used
to test for differences in the proportions of withdrawals
based on the pharmacological mechanisms of action; a
P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
We identified 47 withdrawn medicinal products used for
treating obesity (Additional file 2). We excluded 11
products because they were plant-based “herbal” prod-
ucts and another 11 because they were discontinued be-
fore being granted regulatory approval. This left 25
products for inclusion. Two of the products, fenflur-
amine and dexfenfluramine, were withdrawn worldwide.
Of the remaining 23 products, 19 were withdrawn in
Europe, 11 in Asia, 9 in South America, 8 in North
America, 4 in Africa, and 1 in Australasia (Table 1).
Of the 25 withdrawn products, 22 (92%) were appetite
suppressants acting on monoamine neurotransmitters
(Table 1). Their primary mechanisms of action were
through central effects on adrenoceptors and dopamine
receptors (8); adrenoceptors, dopamine receptors, and
serotonin receptors (5); serotonin receptors only (6);
adrenoceptors only (1); adrenoceptors and serotonin re-
ceptors (1); and serotonin and dopamine receptors (1).
One drug acted on cannabinoid receptors, one by stimu-
lating bile acid secretion, and one by attachment to thy-
roid hormone binding proteins.
Case reports (Level 4 evidence) were cited as evidence
for withdrawal in 20 instances (80%), and Level 3 evi-
dence in two instances (8%) (Table 1). The withdrawal of
one product, chlorphentermine, was based on evidence
from animal studies. Cardiotoxicity accounted for 8
withdrawals (32%) and psychiatric adverse reactions for
7 (28%). Drug abuse or dependence was cited in more
than half of the withdrawals (13 cases, 52%), and drug-
attributed deaths were associated with the withdrawal of
7 products (28%).
Of the 23 withdrawn products acting via monoamine
neurotransmitters, 8 were re-uptake inhibitors and 14
were releasing agents (Table 1). One product, rimonabant,
was an antagonist and inverse agonist at cannabinoid re-
ceptors. The releasing agents were significantly more
likely to be withdrawn because of drug abuse compared
with the re-uptake inhibitors (P = 0.002); the re-uptake in-
hibitors were significantly more likely to be withdrawn be-
cause of cardiovascular adverse reactions compared with
the releasing agents (P = 0.0004). Psychiatric adverse
reactions were not significantly different between the two
groups of agents.
The longest interval between launch and the first re-
port of an adverse drug reaction was 38 years (norpseu-
doephedrine), while the shortest interval was less than
1 year (rimonabant). The median interval between
launch and first report of an adverse drug reaction was
10 years (IQR = 3 to 20 years). In 24% of cases, first re-
ports of the adverse drug reactions in the literature oc-
curred within 2 years. Overall, there was a shortening in
the interval between launch and first published reports
of adverse drug reactions. The interval between launch
and first reports of adverse reactions was considerably
shorter with the re-uptake inhibitors than with the re-
leasing agents: 5.5 years (IQR = 1.3 to 13 years) versus
18 years (IQR = 5.8 to 28 years); see Table 2. The median
interval to first reports of adverse reactions was consid-
erably shorter when there was cardiotoxicity compared
with drug abuse: 5.5 years (IQR = 1.3 to 15 years) versus
15 years (IQR = 5.5 to 24 years).
The longest interval between first report and first
withdrawal was 23 years (phenmetrazine), while the
shortest interval was less than 1 year in three cases (ami-
norex fumarate, cloforex, and iodinated casein; Table 1).
The median interval between first report and first with-
drawal was 11 years (IQR = 0 to 23 years). Figure 1
shows that the more recent the launch year, the faster
the product was withdrawn from the market following
adverse reaction reports. In 48% of cases, withdrawals
occurred within 2 years of the first adverse drug reaction
(ADR) reports. When deaths were attributed to the
products, the median interval to withdrawal was 1 year.
The median time to withdrawal following reports of ad-
verse reactions was shorter with the re-uptake inhibitors
than the releasing agents: 1 year (IQR = 0 to 12 years)
versus 5 years (IQR = 2 to 16 years); Table 2. The median
time to withdrawal following reports of adverse reactions
was considerably longer with drugs that caused abuse or
dependence than with drugs that caused cardiotoxicity:
7 years (IQR = 3.5 to 17 years) versus 0.5 year (IQR = 0
to 5 years).
Discussion
We have identified 25 anti-obesity medications that were
withdrawn after marketing between 1964 and 2009, 23 of
which had centrally acting mechanisms via monoamine
neurotransmitters. The evidence for withdrawal in about
80% of cases was anecdotal reports. Cardiovascular and
psychiatric adverse drug reactions and drug abuse and de-
pendence together accounted for 83% of the withdrawals.
In 28% of cases, deaths were attributed to the products.
Among the centrally acting agents, re-uptake inhibitors
were more likely to be withdrawn because of cardiotoxi-
city, while the neurotransmitter releasers were more likely

 to be withdrawn because of drug abuse and dependence.
When compared with our overall corpus of 462 medicinal
products withdrawn from the market after 1950 [17],
there was no significant difference in the proportion of
case reports being used as evidence for withdrawal. The
median interval to first reports of adverse reactions and
first withdrawals was longer with the anti-obesity products
(11 versus 3 years), but this is likely due to the smaller
proportion of anti-obesity product approvals after 1976
compared with the overall data (the median interval to
withdrawal for the products withdrawn since 1995 was
3 years). Furthermore, the intervals to withdrawal with
more recent product launch are also consistent with the
trend observed in the overall corpus.
The use of case reports as evidence for making with-
drawal decisions in a majority of instances corroborates
our previous findings that formal studies are seldom
conducted when adverse drug reactions are suspected
[18]. In addition, the fact that most of the withdrawn
products were centrally acting anorectics suggests that
use of this class of products in the treatment of obesity
is associated with a negative benefit-to-harm balance
over time (see Table 3 and Additional file 3). Further-
more, the discrepancy in withdrawal patterns across
regulatory authorities indicates a lack of uniformity in
harms assessment by different drug regulators, and also
contributes to discrepancies in patterns of marketing au-
thorizations of this class of products.
That the delays to reports of adverse reactions with time
were shortened, albeit inconsistently, suggests an influence
of better methods for detection of adverse drug reactions,
improved transparency in the report of adverse drug
events by trials investigators, or a combination of the two.
However, the speed with which withdrawals occurred fol-
lowing reports of suspected adverse reactions with more
recently launched drugs arouses suspicion of selective
reporting of harms in the pre-marketing phase. The
shorter intervals to withdrawals when deaths are reported
suggest that regulatory authorities are quicker at making
withdrawal decisions in these circumstances.

 Comparison with existing literature
Our findings are consistent with other published reports.
A previous review reported that most anti-obesity treat-
ments have been withdrawn from the market because of
concerns about adverse reactions [14]. Two other re-
views concluded that cardiovascular and psychiatric ad-
verse reactions are major concerns with psychoactive
anti-obesity drugs that have recently gained marketing
approval from licensing authorities [19, 20]. A recent
analysis of serious adverse reactions reported to the
EudraVigilance database also showed that cardiac and
psychiatric disorders were the most common adverse
reactions attributed to anti-obesity medicinal products
[21]. The authors of another report concluded that lower
doses of multiple chemical entities targeting different
mechanistic pathways should be a priority in future drug
development [1].
Strengths and limitations
To our knowledge, this is the first review that has sys-
tematically identified anti-obesity medicinal products
withdrawn from the market because of adverse drug re-
actions. We comprehensively searched various sources
of information in order to identify anti-obesity medicinal

 products that have been withdrawn, we accounted for
the levels of evidence used in making withdrawal deci-
sions, extracted data on the intervals between launch,
adverse reactions reports, and withdrawals, and explored
the trends in withdrawal over time. We also used statis-
tical methods to explore and compare the patterns of
withdrawal. However, we recognize some limitations.
We may not have identified all countries in which prod-
ucts were withdrawn, and we do not have complete in-
formation about where all the products were marketed;
indeed it is possible that some products were withdrawn
in a few countries because those were the only places
where they were marketed. In addition, we do not have
information on the time lapse between the actual occur-
rence of an adverse reaction and the date the reaction
appeared in the published literature, though we do not
consider that such delays would have significantly influ-
enced our findings. Finally, the intervals between launch,
first adverse reaction reports, and first withdrawals were
computed irrespective of where products were first in-
troduced or where adverse reactions were first observed;
however, some products were withdrawn in some coun-
tries because of adverse reactions reported in others irre-
spective of whether the product was first marketed in
such countries.
Implications for drug therapy
Apart from two products (cyclovalone and iodinated ca-
sein), the products identified in the review had actions
involving 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, serotonin). While
agonist activity at 5HT2A receptors can cause psychiatric
dysfunction [22], stimulation of 5HT2B receptors is asso-
ciated with cardiac abnormalities, largely valvulopathies
[23].The unfavourable benefit-to-harm balance of this
class of products therefore appears to have led to the de-
velopment of new chemical entities that target other
mechanistic pathways. These include leptin sensitizers,
glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, islet
amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), and neuropeptide Y [24]. Of
note, several medicinal products with similar mecha-
nisms of action to the withdrawn psychotropic anti-
obesity medications have been successfully used for
treating other medical conditions, and they have not

(ADHD) and narcolepsy [25, 26].
There were no new approvals of anti-obesity medica-
tions during the 20 years from 1976 to 1995. It is un-
clear what caused this hiatus; however, we observed a
steep increase in the number of scientific publications
relating obesity prevalence and treatment after the hiatus
(PubMed trend; Additional file 4). The resurgence of
new approval applications after the hiatus was not asso-
ciated with a major shift in the development of drugs
that affect neurotransmitters, but it is notable that no
new drugs that cause neurotransmitter release have been
marketed since 1974. This is consistent with the fact that
of the nine medicinal products currently available for
obesity management, all six (78%) that exert their weight
reducing actions through centrally acting mechanisms
act via neurotransmitter release, rather than inhibition
of re-uptake (see Table 4). This suggests that drug devel-
opers have largely abandoned the use of chemical en-
tities that inhibit re-uptake in favour of releasing agents.
However, the lack of long-term data on the safety of

 these products, especially with the more recent ap-
provals, is of great concern. Indeed, psychiatric and car-
diovascular adverse events have been reported as major
concerns of recently approved products with centrally
acting mechanisms [19].
Modest reduction in body weight has beneficial effects
on short-term (≤1 year) cardiovascular profile [27].
However, whether the weight losses generated by anti-
obesity medicinal products have beneficial effects on
long-term cardiovascular outcome is unclear, largely be-
cause the follow-up duration of most clinical trials is not
long enough to assess these benefits beyond the weight
losses achieved [28]; indeed, one large long-term study
(n = 5145; median follow-up of 9.6 years) showed that
weight reduction did not reduce the risk of adverse car-
diovascular events in obese and overweight adults with
type 2 diabetes [29]. In addition, the benefit of aggressive
weight reduction in overweight and obese patients with
cardiovascular decompensation (e.g. patients with heart
failure) has been questioned, because this group of pa-
tients survives for a longer period at higher body weights
[30]. Furthermore, more than one-third of the centrally
acting products included in our review were withdrawn
because their use was associated with adverse cardiovas-
cular outcomes that are the health risks the use of the
products were intended to reduce — an “obesity treat-
ment paradox”.
Implications for future harms assessment and policy
Although there have been revisions to regulatory guid-
ance for the assessment of harms in anti-obesity drug
trials [31, 32], there are uncertainties about the extent to
which these guidelines are applied when assessing trial
results for new weight loss products whose actions are
through central mechanisms. For example, lorcaserin, a
5HT2C receptor agonist, was approved by the FDA based
on the results of three pivotal trials [33–35], with dis-
continuation rates of 45%, 50%, and 34%, with mean dif-
ferences in weight loss of only 3–3.6%. Although two of
the three trials met the FDA guidance for effectiveness
(“The proportion of subjects who lose greater than or
equal to 5 percent of baseline body weight in the active-
product group is at least 35%, is approximately double
the proportion in the placebo-treated group, and the dif-
ference between groups is statistically significant”) [32],
the analysis was based on the per-protocol population
for completers. Furthermore, the trials failed to meet the
FDA’s guidance for products for weight management,
which sets clinical significance at 1 year as 5% weight
loss with at least 80% power. Indeed, the FDA noted that
baseline psychiatric history was limited in the clinical
trials, discontinuations owing to nervous system and
psychiatric disorders were higher with lorcaserin than
with placebo, and the trials were not powered to detect
cardiovascular adverse events [36]; these same concerns
influenced the decision of the EMA in declining the
product’s approval application [37]. In addition, tran-
scripts from the FDA showed that although members of
the voting panel approved the product, many had con-
cerns about cardiovascular harms [38]; it is of further
concern that the post-marketing surveillance of the
product is behind schedule [39].
Similarly, the approval of naltrexone plus bupropion
(Contrave, Mysimba) by the FDA and EMA has been
questioned by some authors because of the potential
for severe harms that appear to outweigh the benefits
[40, 41]. In a recent large randomized trial there was a
significantly increased risk of psychiatric disorders, and
the cardiovascular profile of the product is uncertain
[42]. These questionable approvals by regulatory au-
thorities lend credence to the argument that an inde-
pendent group of experts should be given responsibility
for assessing harms [43]. The re-introduction of amfe-
pramone (diethylpropion) and phentermine in Europe,
based on a long-standing legal action, unrelated to new
information on benefits or harms, is another case in
point [44, 45].
The herbal weight loss medication Ephedra spp., which
has agonist activity at 5HT and dopamine receptors and
showed evidence of beneficial effects on body weight,
was banned by the FDA in 2004 because of an increased
risk of cardiovascular and psychiatric adverse reactions
[46,
47].
That
regulatory
authorities
removed
this
product from the market yet granted its “conventional
analogues” marketing licences arouses suspicion of regu-
latory bias [48].
In addition to the above, several of the products that
have been withdrawn by regulatory authorities are now
marketed as non-prescription formulations, alone, or in
combination over the counter, or via the Internet [49].
Indeed, there have been many reports of suspected ad-
verse reactions attributed to such products [7, 50, 51].
There should be tougher legislative action against the
promoting and marketing of such products.
Conclusions
We have identified 25 anti-obesity medications with-
drawn after marketing over the past 60 years, 23 of
which were centrally acting anorectics. Psychiatric dis-
turbances, cardiotoxicity, or drug abuse and dependence
accounted for more than 80% of withdrawals. Centrally
acting products that caused release of monoamines
were significantly more likely to be withdrawn because
of adverse cardiovascular reactions, while monoamine
re-uptake inhibitors were more likely to be withdrawn
because of drug abuse and dependence. Greater trans-
