BACKGROUND: The age-adjusted annual incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) has risen worldwide. This trend may be affected
by the secular increase in height and the sharp upswing in adolescent overweight; these drive increased insulinlike growth factor 1
and chronic inflammation, which may play an etiologic role. This study examined the association of the body mass index (BMI) and
height of adolescents with NHL subtypes, which have been insufficiently evaluated. METHODS: Health-related data on 2,352,988 Is-
raeli adolescents, aged 16 to 19 years, who were examined between 1967 and 2011 were linked to the Israel National Cancer Registry
to derive the NHL incidence up to December 31, 2012 (4021 cases). Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to estimate the
multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for NHL subtypes associated with the BMI and height of adolescents. RESULTS: Adolescent
overweight and obesity were associated with an HR of 1.25 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-1.37; P 5 1.14 3 1025) for NHL in compari-
son with normal weight. There was a graded association of height with NHL (P 5 4.29 3 1029), with the tallest adolescents (�95th per-
centile vs 25th to < 50th percentiles [US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]) exhibiting an HR of 1.28 (95% CI, 1.04-1.56).
Marginal zone lymphoma, primary cutaneous lymphoma (PCL), and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) showed the strongest
associations for overweight/obesity, and DLBCL and PCL showed the strongest associations for height. CONCLUSIONS: The findings
of this large cohort study add to the growing body of evidence showing that higher body weight and taller stature during adoles-
cence are associated with an increased risk of NHL and may modestly contribute to its increasing incidence. Further studies are
needed to elucidate the mechanisms linking anthropometric measures and NHL risk. Cancer 2016;122:1068-77. V

INTRODUCTION
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a heterogeneous group of neoplasms composed of several histologic subtypes1 that
collectively constitute the 10th most common cancer worldwide,2 the 6th most commonly diagnosed cancer among men
and women in the United States,3 and the 5th and 6th most common cancer in Israeli men and women, respectively.4 The
most frequent subtypes5 are shown in Table 1.
The etiology of NHL is poorly understood. A sharp, unexplained increase in incidence rates has been observed for
more than 30 years.6 In Israel, the age-adjusted annual incidence of NHL among men rose by 27% from 1990 through
2012 and increased from 12.4 to 15.7 per 100,0004; this is estimated to be the highest worldwide for both sexes.2
Numerous cohort and case-control studies have evaluated the relation between body mass index (BMI) in adulthood
and NHL incidence. In a meta-analysis of 16 studies (1966-2007; 21,720 cases), Larsson and Wolk7 reported relative risks
of 1.07 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.14) for overweight individuals (BMI 5 25-30 kg/m2) and 1.20 (95% CI,
1.07-1.34) for the obese (BMI > 30 kg/m2). In an updated meta-analysis,8 analyzing 16 studies of NHL incidence (1966-

 2011; 17,291 cases), they found that BMI was associated
with a 7% increase in risk for NHL (relative risk, 1.07;
95% CI, 1.04-1.10) for each 5 kg/m2. In a further meta-
analysis of the 6 studies that reported results for NHL sub-
types, BMI was significantly associated with the risk of dif-
fuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) but not with the
risk of follicular lymphoma (FL), small lymphocytic lym-
phoma (SLL), or B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(CLL). In a pooled analysis from the International Lym-
phoma Epidemiology Consortium (InterLymph; > 10,000
cases of NHL and 16,000 controls), Willet et al9 reported
an increased risk (odds ratio, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.24-2.62) for
DLBCL among the severely obese (BMI > 40 kg/m2) but
not generally for NHL, and there was no consistent associ-
ation across studies for the obese and overweight (25kg/
m2 < BMI < 39.9 kg/m2). As for height, the tallest men,
but not women, were at increased risk for NHL (pooled
odds ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.06-1.34) in comparison with
those who were of midrange height. Most recently, in a
meta-analysis focused on DLBCL, Castillo et al10 showed
a 14% increase in the incidence of DLBCL for each 10kg/
m2 increase in BMI.
It has been proposed that a possible mechanistic link
between obesity and NHL is chronic inflammation.
Whether increasing rates of NHL in Israel may be related
in part to the rapid rise in obesity in Israel as in the United
States and worldwide11 and to secular increases in height
is unclear.12,13 Maskarinec et al14 found that the reported
body weight and BMI at the age of 21 years were better
predictors of the risk of NHL in late adulthood than
weight and BMI at the baseline in a cohort of 45- to 75-
year-olds. Their interpretation was that the weight at the
age of 21 years was highly relevant to the etiology of
NHL, possibly by better representing the lifetime adipos-
ity status.
The aforementioned reports were based on self-
reported recall of weight and height in late adolescence/
early adulthood and not on actual measurements at ado-
lescence. In addition, no previous study assessed these ad-
olescent risk factors for the entire spectrum of NHL
histologic subtypes in young adulthood.
Our objective was to examine the association
between measured adolescent height and weight and the
incidence of NHL and to assess the risk of developing
each of the 5 most frequent subtypes of NHL in a national
cohort of 2,352,988 examinees aged 16 to 19 years.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
Israeli adolescents report to recruitment centers for an
obligatory medical board examination to assess their suit-
ability for military service, usually at the age of 17 years.
This analysis was restricted to Jewish males and females
aged 16 to 19 years who were examined from 1967
through 2011. To reduce the heterogeneity of the study
population, we excluded non-Jewish examinees (approxi-
mately 4% of the total), many of whom were Druze
males. Examinees without recorded weight and height
measurements were excluded, as were examinees with a
cancer diagnosis that preceded their medical examination.

 Anthropometrics
Height and weight were measured with a stadiometer and
a beam balance scale, respectively, by trained personnel.
Health conditions were recorded and coded during the
medical examination. BMIs, calculated as the weight in
kilograms divided by the height in meters squared, were
stratified according to US Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) percentiles15 into 3 groups: nor-
mal weight (5th to <85th percentiles) with a mean BMI
for the cohort of 21.07 kg/m2 (standard deviation [SD],
1.84 kg/m2) for males and 20.96 kg/m2 (SD, 1.99 kg/m2)
for females, overweight and obese (�85th percentile) with
a mean BMI of 28.30 kg/m2 (SD, 3.06 kg/m2) for males
and 28.40 kg/m2 (SD, 3.04 kg/m2) for females, and
underweight (<5th percentile) with a mean BMI of 17.10
kg/m2 (SD, 0.73 kg/m2) for males and 16.63 kg/m2 (SD,
0.63 kg/m2) for females (see Table 2 for median values).
Height was analyzed according to CDC criteria in 8 per-
centile groupings (Table 3), the midrange reference group
being defined as the 25th to 50th percentiles.
Sociodemographic Variables
The baseline data included the year of birth, sex, age at ex-
amination, country of origin (European, Asian, African or
Israeli; based on the father’s or grandfather’s place of birth
[the latter if the father was Israeli-born]), years of educa-
tion (�9, 10, 11, or � 12 years), socioeconomic status of
the city/town/village/settlement of residence (on a 1-10
scale), and residence (urban vs rural).16
Ascertainment of NHL Incidence
The cohort was linked to the Israel National Cancer
Registry (INCR) by means of the personal identification
number given to all Israeli citizens at birth or immigra-
tion. Linkage was up to December 31, 2012. Lymphomas
were analyzed as a single group and then according to the
5 most frequent histological subtypes in this population,
and they were included only if they were the first cancer
diagnosis recorded (ie, primary NHL).
The INCR is a population-based registry that was
initiated in 1960. It meets international requirements for
the coding system (International Classification of Diseases
for Oncology, 3rd edition) and data completeness.17 Since
1982, all oncologists in Israel have been obliged by law to
report cancer cases and some borderline, uncertain behav-
ior and benign tumors to the INCR of the Ministry of
Health. Others also compelled by law to report include
private and public pathology and hematology institutes,
hospitals, and health insurers.
Since 1990, the standard for reporting has been that
issued by the Middle East Cancer Consortium. This
standard, which has much in common with Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results standards, has a concise
coding system to which all reports of cancer cases in Israel
adhere. Thus, there is a very high degree of consistency in
the diagnosis and coding of cases included in the INCR.
The overwhelming majority of cancer patients in Israel
are managed by the national health care system, within
which diagnoses and reporting are standardized and thus
quite uniform.
The completeness of the reports is high; this was also
the case before 1982 when reporting was voluntary and
not mandatory. Lymphoma was defined as a disease that
had to be reported throughout the study period. Report-
ing of lymphomas is estimated to be 91% complete (L.
Keinan-Boker, INCR supervisor, written communica-
tion, July 2015). However, the accuracy of the diagnosis
of the subtypes of lymphoma has changed over the years.
In the early years (mostly until 1970), two-thirds of the
cases were defined as lymphoma, not otherwise specified,
whereas a third were defined as B-cell lymphoma. With
the development of more advanced diagnostic methods,
this situation changed, and in recent years, approximately
10% of the total lymphoma diagnoses have been defined
as not otherwise specified, approximately 80% have been
B-cell lymphomas, and the rest have been T-cell or other
lymphomas. Because 94.2% of all our NHL cases were
diagnosed between 1990 and 2012, including 73.5%
from 2000 onward (and only 4.3% and 1.5% between
1980 and 1989 and between 1967 and 1979, respectively,
when the determination of subtypes was incomplete), we
are confident that the pathological classification was rea-
sonably uniform and 90% complete in this data set.

 Initially, all NHLs defined according to the World
Health Organization classification5,18 were included. Af-
ter we first examined the association of suspected adoles-
cent risk factors with the total NHL incidence, the 5 most
common specific lymphomas in our cohort (DLBCL, FL,
CLL/SLL, marginal zone lymphoma [MZL], and primary
cutaneous lymphoma [PCL]) were assessed.
Statistical Analysis
The characteristics of the participants are presented as
arithmetic means and SDs. Cox proportional hazards
models were used to evaluate associations between the
baseline adolescent anthropometric characteristics and the
time to NHL diagnosis. Follow-up ceased at the date of
diagnosis of NHL, at the first diagnosis of any other can-
cer, at the date of death (derived from the national popu-
lation registry), or on December 31, 2012, whichever
came first.
Covariates were initially introduced individually. A
multivariate analysis with weight and height introduced as
categorical independent variables included suspected con-
founders that showed an association in the univariate
analysis at the P < .05 level of significance. A linear trend
in height percentiles (using the midpoint of each of the 8
CDC percentile groupings) and in BMI treated as a con-
tinuous variable was tested. In the absence of a sex interac-
tion for the associations of both overweight and height
with NHL (P 5 .486 and P 5 .160, respectively), sex-
specific analyses were not undertaken. All models
included the year of birth, age at examination, and sex.
We also calculated the fraction of NHL attributable to
height above the median and to overweight/obesity (the
population attributable risk percentage). Analyses were
performed with SPSS software (version 21).
Ethics
The institutional review board of the Israel Defense Forces
Medical Corps approved the study. After data linkage at
the INCR, personal identifiers were permanently deleted
from the working file so that all analyses were performed
with deidentified data.

 RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics
The cohort included 2,352,988 adolescents aged 16 to 19
years who were followed for a mean of 20.3 6 12.1 years
for a total of 47,669,479 person-years. Table 3 displays
the participants’ baseline characteristics. The mean age at
examination was 17.3 6 0.4 years. Parents or grandpar-
ents of examinees were born primarily in Europe or coun-
tries of emigration from Europe (41.7%), with 26.5%
originating from Asia (predominantly western Asia) and
25.9% from Africa (predominantly North Africa).
Among the adolescents, 80.3% had 12 or more years of
education. Overweight (95th percentile > BMI � 85th
percentile) was noted in 201,842 examinees (8.6%), and
obesity (BMI � 95th percentile) was noted in 90,502
examinees (3.8%). The increased variance that accompa-
nied the increase in the mean BMI over 4 decades reflects
a substantial increase in overweight and obesity in both
sexes (ie, in the right tail of the distribution). More recent
birth cohorts of men were on average taller in adolescence
than those born earlier, whereas for women, there was lit-
tle overall change in the average adolescent height across
birth cohorts.12,19 The Israeli adolescents tended to be less
overweight or obese and were shorter than the CDC per-
centile distributions.
Characteristics of the NHL Cases
A total of 4021 cases of NHL were identified in this
cohort during the follow-up period. The mean age at
diagnosis was 41.4 6 11.4 years. The most frequent
subtypes were DLBCL (n 5 1402), PCL (n 5 553), FL
(n 5 528), CLL/SLL (n 5 340), and MZL (n 5 246;
Table 1).
In unadjusted Cox analyses, the year of birth, sex,
height, and weight were significantly associated with
NHL (Table 4). The age at examination, country of

 origin, years of education, socioeconomic status, and
urban/rural residence were not associated with the risk of
NHL.
In a multivariate analysis adjusted for sex, year of
birth, and age at examination, weight and height were
positively associated with NHL (Table 4). Overweight or
obesity according to CDC criteria was associated with a
hazard
ratio
(HR)
of
1.25 (95%
CI, 1.13-1.37;
P 5 1.14 3 1025) to develop NHL in comparison with
normal-weight subjects. When we modeled BMI as a con-
tinuous variable in kilograms per meters squared and
adjusted for birth year, sex, age at examination, and
height, the HR per 5 units of BMI was 1.160 (95% CI,
1.104-1.219; P 5 3.70 3 1029). The population attribut-
able risk percentage for overweight/obesity was 2.9%
(95% CI, 1.1%-4.9%).
With heights grouped into 8 ascending percentile
categories (Table 4), there was a graded increase in the
multivariate-adjusted risk of NHL (P 5 4.29 3 1029 for
a linear trend in percentiles). In comparison with the mid-
range height category (25th to < 50th percentiles), shorter
individuals were at lower risk (<5th percentile for height;
HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.65-0.87), whereas the tallest exam-
inees were at increased risk of NHL (�95th percentile for
height; HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.04-1.56). The population
attributable fraction for height above the median was
5.6% (95% CI, 2.5%-8.7%).
We also examined whether there was a difference in
the associations of overweight/obesity and height with
NHL between younger and older patients at diagnosis;
the patients were divided by the median age of 42.54
years. Below the median age at diagnosis, the HR for over-
weight/obesity
was
1.174
(95%
CI,
1.026-1.343;
P 5 .019), and above the median age, the association was
stronger but not significantly so (HR, 1.334; 95% CI,
1.161-1.533; P 5 5.0 3 1025), with adjustments for
birth year, sex, and height. The association with height
was also somewhat weaker for the younger age at diagnosis
and rose monotonically to an HR of 1.595 (95% CI,
1.172-2.171) for the top 5th CDC percentile group ver-
sus the lowest 5th percentile group, whereas the HR was
1.825 (95% CI, 1.266-2.632) for the older age at
diagnosis.
When the multivariate model was evaluated sepa-
rately for each of the 5 most common NHL subtypes (Ta-
ble 5), overweight or obesity in adolescence was found to
be a statistically significant predictor for MZL (HR, 1.70;
95% CI, 1.19-2.42), PCL (HR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.13-
1.83), and DLBCL (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.12-1.54) and a
borderline predictor for FL (1.28, 95% CI, 0.97-1.67;
P 5 .08; Table 5). In addition, height was independently
positively associated with all 5 subtypes when it was tested
for a linear trend in percentiles (Table 5). It showed the
strongest associations with DLBCL (HR, 1.005; 95% CI,
1.003-1.007; P 5 5.76 3 1026) and PCL (HR, 1.005;
95% CI, 1.002-1.008; P 5 .003), an intermediate associa-
tion with MZL (HR, 1.004; 95% CI, 0.999-1.009;
P 5 .088), and weaker associations with FL (HR, 1.003;
95% CI, 0.999-1.006; P 5 .106) and CLL/SLL (HR,
1.002; 95% CI, 0.998-1.006; P 5 .41). For PCL and
DLBCL, the HRs for the tallest group versus the group
with heights less than the 5th percentile were 3.19 (95%
CI, 1.74-5.86) and 2.21 (95% CI, 1.57-3.12), respec-
tively (Table 5).
DISCUSSION
In this cohort of 2,352,988 adolescents aged 16 to 19
years at the baseline, who were followed for 47,669,479
person-years, overweight/obesity and taller stature were
independent predictors of NHL incidence. The associa-
tion of overweight/obesity in adolescence (BMI � 85th
percentile) was evident for 4 NHL subtypes: MZL, PCL,
DLBCL, and FL. All 4 subtypes showed a positive associa-
tion of height with NHL, and this was statistically signifi-
cant for DLBCL and PCL. The tallest adolescents (�95th
percentile) showed increased risk restricted to DLBCL
and PCL.
Recent meta-analyses and pooled large-scale data
analyses support a positive association between obesity in
adulthood and NHL overall, and this is most consistently
apparent for the DLBCL subtype.7-10 In addition,
Aschebrook-Kilfoy et al20 recently reported a positive
association between adult obesity (BMI � 30 kg/m2) and
PCL (relative risk, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.03-2.4) in a pooled
analysis of 14 case-control studies (324 mycosis fungoides
and S�
ezary syndrome cases and 17,217 controls) in North
America and Europe.
Several studies have evaluated the association of
BMI earlier in life among adolescents and the risk of
NHL in later adulthood.6,14,21-24 In accordance with our
findings, most reported a positive association, and this
suggests that early-life BMI may be more pertinent to
NHL etiology than later-life BMI, possibly because BMI
at the age of 21 years may better represent lifetime
adiposity.14
Similarly to our results showing the strongest associ-
ations of late adolescent BMI with DLBCL, Bertrand
et al6 observed associations between BMI in young adult-
hood (18-21 years) and the risk of NHL, with somewhat
stronger associations apparent for the DLBCL and FL

 subtypes.6 Our results differed from theirs in the strong
associations with MZL and PCL and the weak association
with FL.
Height in late adolescence showed a graded associa-
tion with NHL across the CDC percentile groupings. The
tallest adolescents (height � 95th percentile) had a 28%
increased risk of NHL in comparison with the adolescents
of midrange height and an approximately 70% increased
risk in comparison with the shortest adolescents (<5th
percentile). Previous studies have reported height as a risk
factor for NHL.3,6,21,22,25-28 However, in an analysis that
combined 18 studies from 13 countries, the tallest men
were found to have a minimally greater risk in comparison
with men of midrange height.9
Among the NHL histological subtypes in our study,
the most prominently elevated risk for the tallest group
was associated with DLBCL and PCL. Among the 8 stud-
ies that analyzed height and specific NHL subtypes, 4
found a positive association with DLBCL,22,27-29 1 found
a positive association with FL,30 and 2 found a positive
association with CLL/SLL.3,21 Our study appears to be
the first to report a similar association of PCL with height.
Various mechanisms have been proposed as media-
tors of the observed associations between body size and
risk for NHL. One explanation is shared processes that
affect growth in childhood and adolescence and energy
homeostasis as well as tumorigenesis.31 Impaired immune
function, known to be of paramount importance in the
etiology of NHL, can be related to both undernutrition
and overnutrition.32,33 Obesity is associated with chronic
inflammation, insulin resistance, compensatory hyperin-
sulinemia, and increased insulinlike growth factor 1 (IGF-
1) levels.21,29,33,34 In addition, oxidative stress, crosstalk
between tumor cells and surrounding adipocytes, migrat-
ing adipose stromal cells, obesity-induced hypoxia, and
shared genetic susceptibility may factor into the mecha-
nism linking overweight and tumorigenesis.35 Under
these circumstances, signaling pathways that inhibit

 apoptosis and promote B-cell proliferation may be stimu-
lated by increased serum levels of proinflammatory fac-
tors, such as tumor necrosis factor a, interleukin-6, and
C-reactive protein.36 There is also evidence that the bone
marrow microenvironment plays a key role in the initia-
tion and maintenance of hematological malignancies.37
Because of the biological, clinical, pathologic, and
genetic heterogeneity associated with the development of
different types of lymphomas, it is likely that there is an
inherent heterogeneity in their etiology as well.10,38 As
support for this paradigm, a variety of viral and bacterial
infections and chronic inflammatory and autoimmune
processes, among other conditions, have been associated
with specific types of lymphomas. The InterLymph Non-
Hodgkin Lymphoma Subtypes Project has recently eval-
uated several risk factors and found support for a common
etiology and heterogeneity for NHL subtypes. The risk
factor patterns suggest that immune dysfunction is more
important in the etiology of DLBCL, MZL, and periph-
eral T-cell lymphoma than it is in CLL/SLL and FL.38
These findings are in support of our own and others’ find-
ings, in which early anthropometric measures, possibly
phenotypic markers of immune function, were associated
with DLBCL, MZL, and PCL but not with other NHL
subtypes.38
More recently, it has been shown that DLBCL cell
lines depend on fatty acids for their survival and that fatty
acid metabolism could be a potential therapeutic target
for DLBCL.39,40 However, the exact mechanisms linking
obesity, fatty acids, and DLBCL remain to be elucidated.
The nature of the association between height and
the risk of NHL has also been explored. In addition to
genetics, height can be affected by nutrition and exposure
to childhood and adolescent diseases.25 Lu et al21
described possible pathways underlying the link between
height and the risk of NHL. Height and excess nutrition
in childhood have been related to higher IGF-1 lev-
els,31,41-44 which have an important effect on growth hor-
mone
and
childhood
growth.45
IGF-1
promotes
maturation of pro-B cells to pre-B46 as well as B-cell pro-
liferation47 and also inhibits apoptosis.48 Therefore,
height may be a reflection of growth patterns in childhood
and IGF-1 levels, which are related to the genesis of
lymphoma.
The strengths of this study include the prospective
design, the completeness of follow-up, the large cohort
size (indeed the largest cohort of young adults to date),
and the fact that anthropometric measures were taken at
the ages of 16 to 19 years by trained medical personnel
and were not based on recall and self-reports. In addition,
this is the first study to analyze the associations between
multiple NHL subtypes and body size in young
adulthood.
The current study is limited by the lack of data on
the DLBCL cell of origin (activated B-cell, germinal cen-
ter, or other), each of which has specific biological and
clinical characteristics49; future research on the etiology of
NHL should explore relating specific risk factors to mo-
lecular disease subtypes. Our analysis did not account for
emigration from Israel as a possible source of selection
bias. This information is extremely hard to attain, is sub-
ject to a wide variety of definitions, and is under constant
change. However, outmigration from Israel is estimated
overall to be fairly low; according to a 2005 estimate of
the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Devel-
opment, outmigration from Israel stood at approximately
2.9/1000.50 Another limitation is that BMI measure-
ments were available only for the ages of 16 to 19 years;
these are likely to have changed over the follow-up period.
However, Patel et al3 have shown that changes in weight
during adulthood are not associated with the risk of
NHL.
In conclusion, in this cohort of 2,352,988 adoles-
cents followed for up to 46 years and for 47,669,479
person-years, excess adolescent body weight was associ-
ated with an increased risk of NHL overall and specifically
MZL, PCL, and DLBCL. Height was associated with an
increased risk of all NHL and DLBCL and PCL in partic-
ular. The population attributable fraction of all NHL for
height above the median was approximately 6%. As
expected, height has increased in successive birth cohorts
in our study population, more so in males than females,
and this has likely contributed to the increased risk of
NHL. The prevalence of overweight and obesity has
increased substantially in the United States and Israel
since the 1980s, and this is concurrent with the increased
incidence of NHL. However, the fraction of NHL attrib-
utable to overweight/obesity is modest (approximately
3%). Nevertheless, the potential role of height and obesity
in NHL etiology is of public health relevance, and some
of it (excess weight) may be preventable. Further studies
are needed to elucidate the biological mechanisms
through which weight and height in adolescence influence
the future risk of developing specific NHL subtypes.
