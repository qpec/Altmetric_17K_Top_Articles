ABSTRACT
Despite long-term investment, influenza continues to be a significant worldwide problem. The cornerstone of pro-
tection remains vaccination, and approved vaccines seek to elicit a hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titer of >1:40 as the pri-
mary correlate of protection. However, recent poor vaccine performance raises questions regarding the protection afforded and
whether other correlates of protection should be targeted. A healthy volunteer challenge study was performed with a wild-type
2009 A(H1N1)pdm influenza A challenge virus at the NIH Clinical Center to evaluate two groups of participants with HAI titers
of >1:40 and <1:40. The primary objective was to determine whether participants with HAI titers of >1:40 were less likely to
develop mild to moderate influenza disease (MMID) after intranasal inoculation. HAI titers of >1:40 were protective against
MMID but did not reduce the incidence of symptoms alone. Although the baseline HAI titer correlated with some reduction in
disease severity measures, overall, the baseline NAI titer correlated more significantly with all disease severity metrics and had a
stronger independent effect on outcome. This study demonstrates the importance of examining other immunological correlates
of protection rather than solely HAI titers. This challenge study confirms the importance of NAI titer as a correlate and for the
first time establishes that it can be an independent predictor of reduction of all aspects of influenza disease. This suggests that
NAI titer may play a more significant role than previously thought and that neuraminidase immunity should be considered
when studying susceptibility after vaccination and as a critical target in future influenza vaccine platforms.
IMPORTANCE
This study represents the first time the current gold standard for evaluating influenza vaccines as set by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, a “pro-
tective” hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titer of >1:40, has been evaluated in a well-controlled healthy volunteer challenge
study since the cutoff was established. We used our established wild-type influenza A healthy volunteer human challenge model
to evaluate how well this antibody titer predicts a reduction in influenza virus-induced disease. We demonstrate that although
higher HAI titer is predictive of some protection, there is stronger evidence to suggest that neuraminidase inhibition (NAI) titer
is more predictive of protection and reduced disease. This is the first time NAI titer has been clearly identified in a controlled
trial of this type to be an independent predictor of a reduction in all aspects of influenza.

espite significant investment in influenza preparedness, an-
nual estimates of death due to seasonal influenza range up to
49,000 in the United States (1) and 250,000 to 500,000 deaths in
industrialized countries (2, 3). Pandemics can have an even more
devastating effect, and continued efforts are being made to im-
prove countermeasures for this worldwide problem (4).
Currently, vaccination is the cornerstone of prophylaxis and
the most effective method available to reduce the yearly impact of
influenza on the world’s population (5, 6). Influenza vaccines in
widespread use are standardized by the amount of the major sur-
face glycoprotein, hemagglutinin (HA), contained in the vaccine
preparation. Measurements of serum antibodies in response to
the HA are the current gold standard for evaluating vaccines. The
U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines
Agency Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use both
define “protective” titers as a hemagglutination inhibition (HAI)
titer of �1:40 (7).
The evidence for this cutoff comes from a seminal live influ-
enza virus challenge trial conducted in 1972 by Hobson et al.,
which established that a prechallenge serum HAI titer of 18 to 36

 was associated with 50% protection from infection (8), and a sim-
ilar study demonstrating a 29% infection rate in those with HAI
titers of 1:40 to 60 (9). Other studies in the setting of live and
attenuated influenza virus challenge have been less conclusive
(10–12). A more recent study, conducted using live attenuated
viruses, demonstrated 50% protection from intranasal infection
in those with titers of �1:40 (13), but a recent epidemiological
study of vaccine performance has brought this into question, with
only 22% protection of children with postvaccination titers of
�1:40 (14). Even more concerning are data from the recent influ-
enza seasons suggesting that current seasonal vaccines held to
these standards are greatly underperforming, as overall seasonal
vaccine effectiveness over the past 10 years has ranged from 10 to
56% with a mean of 40% (15). This is especially concerning for at
risk populations who most require protection and in whom even
worse performance has been observed (16).
The variability of results in past studies and variations in recent
influenza vaccine efficacy are likely multifactorial and suggest that
more work is needed to better understand the correlates of pro-
tection in influenza infection. Differences in outcome measures,
well described interlaboratory variations in HAI and microneu-
tralization assay results (17, 18), evolving viral phenotypes, host
factors, and differences in how protection is defined could all fur-
ther confound interpretation of results and contribute to the vari-
ation seen in these and other studies of influenza immunity. Cur-
rently, vaccine efficacy is evaluated predominantly by increases in

group and 34 in the low-HAI-titer group up to 3 months prior to challenge. On admission for challenge, 16 participants were found to have HAI titers that had
increased or decreased since the time of screening either due to waning titers or exposure to virus. Three participants were excluded prior to challenge for safety
reasons. Thirty-one participants on the high-titer group and 40 participants in the low-titer group were challenged, and 6 participants in the high-titer group were
excluded from the analysis due to detection of another respiratory viral infection within 48 h of challenge.

 HAI titers, and other possible correlates of immune protection
(e.g., neuraminidase inhibition [NAI] titers or other types of im-
munity) have generally either not been examined or have been
relegated to secondary considerations.
This study was designed to evaluate the role of the traditional
“protective” HAI titer of �1:40 as a correlate of protection in an
established well-controlled human challenge study with the influ-
enza A/2009 A(H1N1)pdm (pdm stands for pandemic) virus (19).
This is the first healthy volunteer challenge study to specifically
evaluate this cutoff since it was established. Virologic and clinical
data as correlative parameters of protection were compared be-
tween patients with prechallenge titers of �1:40 or �1:40. The
human challenge model employed in this trial offered a unique
opportunity to overcome many of the limitations of past studies
and perform not only a comprehensive evaluation of HAI but also
to investigate the correlation of antineuraminidase antibodies to
protection as measured by baseline neuraminidase inhibition ti-
ters. Understanding how these baseline antibody titers predict
outcomes as correlates of protection allows us to better under-
stand how different immune factors may interact as independent
and dependent factors in influenza disease and may lead to further
identification of other correlates of protection, development of
better tools to predict outcomes, and identify improved vaccine
targets and countermeasures.
RESULTS
Seventy-four participants were eligible after screening. As the
screening took place up to 3 months in advance, some participants
were found to have higher or lower titers at the time of admission
so they were moved to the appropriate group for analysis (Fig. 1).
After enrollment in the study, three participants were found inel-
igible for safety reasons and were excluded from challenge, and an
additional six were subsequently excluded after testing positive for
other respiratory infections within 48 h of influenza virus chal-
lenge (Fig. 1). Thus, 65 participants challenged were included in
this analysis, 25 participants in the high-titer group with an HAI
titer of �1:40 (geometric mean titer [GMT] of 214.9) and 40
participants in the low-titer group with an HAI titer of �1:40
(GMT of 6.4). There were no significant differences in age, gender,
race, or ethnicity between the two HAI titer groups (Table 1).
Significantly fewer participants in the high-HAI-titer group
developed MMID than in the low-HAU-titer group (24% versus
72%; P � 0.001). However, no statistical difference was observed
in the proportion of participants reporting influenza symptoms
regardless of viral shedding, with 80% in the high-titer group and
88% in the low-titer group reporting symptoms (P � 0.489) (Ta-
ble 2). Only two of the four disease severity measures, those related
to duration of disease (shedding and symptoms) demonstrated a
significant decrease in severity in those in the �1:40 HAI titer
group compared to the �1:40 HAI titer group (Fig. 2). The num-
ber and severity of symptoms were not significantly reduced
(Fig. 2). Quantitative measurements of viral shedding did demon-
strate decreased quantity and duration in the �1:40 titer group
compared to the �1:40 titer group, which correlated well with
reduced symptom duration (Fig. 3).
An analysis of these same primary and secondary clinical out-
come measures was performed after grouping the participants by
baseline (day 0) NAI titer into �1:40 (high-titer) or �1:40 (low-
titer) groups (Table 1). Similar to baseline HAI, those with a high
baseline NAI were found to be less likely to develop MMID, 44%
versus 100% (P � 0.001), respectively. Unlike baseline HAI titer,
all four disease severity metrics demonstrated a reduction in se-
verity of illness in those with NAI titers of �1:40, including not
only symptom and shedding duration but also reduction in the
number of symptoms and symptom severity (Fig. 4).
Overall, those participants with higher baseline levels of a com-
bination of HAI and NAI titers had reduced disease severity over
those with low titers of both HAI and NAI or of HAI alone (Fig. 5).
No participants were found to have a high HAI titer with a low
NAI titer. Linear regression analysis and two variable correlation
analyses of baseline HAI and NAI titers demonstrated a stronger,

 titers showed no significant independent effect on any of the dis-
ease severity measures examined (Table 3).
Antibody responses were measured postchallenge demonstrat-
ing no significant increase in the HAI GMT in the high-HAI-titer
group after challenge (week 8), but a clear increase was noted in
the low-HAI-titer group (Fig. 7A). The response in the low-titer
group was variable, with approximately 50% of those participants
showing a very significant �4-fold rise in titer, while the other
50% of participants showed no significant increase in HAI titer
(Fig. 7B). When grouped by baseline NAI titers, those participants
with high titers (�1:40) had only minimal increases in NAI GMT
after challenge, but unlike HAI titer, every participant with a low
NAI titer had a rise in NAI titer after challenge, regardless of clin-
ical outcome (Fig. 7C).
DISCUSSION
In this human influenza challenge study, participants with a pre-
challenge HAI titer of �1:40 showed significantly less incidence of
MMID and some reduction in the duration of disease compared
to participants with low HAI titers (�1:40) following experimen-
tal infection with a wild-type influenza A/H1N1pdm virus. These
data confirm that HAI titers of �1:40 are indeed a correlate of
protection, but while consistent with previous studies evaluating
protection afforded by higher HAI titers (8–10), the results from
this study help clarify that the protection predicted is not complete
and that other correlates, such as NAI titer, may offer important
additional or even enhanced predictive information compared to
HAI titers alone. For example, in this study while high HAI titer
was predictive of a reduction in the incidence of MMID, influenza
symptoms without shedding were still just as likely to occur as in
participants with low HAI titers. If these results are consistent with
outcomes following natural influenza infection, the protection
afforded by an HAI titer of �1:40 would not necessarily include
the prevention of a clinical influenza-like illness, even if it does
predict some reduction in the duration of illness and viral shed-
ding, and thus spread of disease. This finding is important to con-
sider for future studies and may account for some of the inconsis-
tencies in current evaluations of influenza vaccine performance
that do not take disease severity/duration into account, as many
individuals receiving an efficacious vaccine might still report in-
fluenza symptoms following viral exposure/infection.
Although the incidence of influenza-like illness symptoms was
not reduced in those with high HAI titers, there was a trend to-
ward reduction of all disease severity measures, with the most
significant being in duration of both viral shedding and symp-
toms. Overall though, many participants with high HAI baseline
titers still suffered from influenza symptoms, making clear that
the protection predicted by baseline HAI titers is not complete.
Interestingly, the association of high NAI titers with a more
robust protective effect than HAI titers in this study cohort was
striking. A reduction of disease severity in influenza infection of
both animals and humans in the presence of antineuraminidase
antibodies has been well described since 1969 (20–24), and as

 predictive of reduced incidence of MMID as HAI but unlike in-
creasing HAI titers that correlated only with reduced shedding
duration, we observed that increasing NAI titers negatively corre-
lated with all four measures of disease severity, including the du-
ration of shedding and of symptoms, number of symptoms, and
symptom severity. When evaluated together, HAI titers had no
independent effect on disease severity measures including shed-
ding duration, while NAI titers did demonstrate independent ef-
fects on all disease severity measures. Given that not all partici-
pants with high antineuraminidase titers had high HAI titers, but
all those with HAI titers of �1:40 also had NAI titers of �1:40,
these data suggest that the reduced disease severity observed in
individuals with high baseline HAI titers is likely driven to a con-
siderable extent by high antineuraminidase antibody titers and
not an effect of antihemagglutinin antibodies alone.
Ultimately, both HAI and NAI titers together may be a better
predictor of MMID and disease severity than either alone, but
these data suggest that NAI titer is a stronger correlate of disease
severity than is HAI titer alone. In this patient cohort, there was
more variability in response after infection in HAI titers than in
NAI titers during the 2 months following viral challenge. All par-
ticipants with low NAI titers at baseline developed a significant
increase in titer after challenge, while approximately 50% of those
with low baseline HAI titers had no significant rise in titer. Those
who demonstrated no rise in titer were just as likely to develop
MMID and the severity of disease of these individuals was similar
to those who did respond, ruling out the possibility of no infection
in these cases. To the degree that a challenge model mimics natural
infection, this high variability in detected antihemagglutinin an-
tibody responses suggests that estimates of influenza infection
rates based primarily on serosurveys may significantly underesti-
mate the true infection rate and also raises concern over whether
convalescent-phase HAI titers should be regarded as optimal
markers of recent infection.
Influenza immunity is a complex interplay of host immunity
primarily acting at the site of inoculation, the nasopharynx, and
upper airway. Circulating serum antibodies to HA and NA are
clear surrogate markers of immunity and may actually be a better
correlate when considered together rather than separately. Al-
though a challenge study of this type does not necessarily replicate
how humans become infected with influenza naturally, it still
points out the importance of careful consideration of how protec-
tion is defined and suggests a strategy by which evaluation of the
correlates of protection to influenza can lead to improved evalu-
ation of vaccine efficacy. These data further suggest that NAI titer
may play a more significant role as a correlate of protection than
previously thought and that the role of neuraminidase immunity
should be considered when studying influenza susceptibility after
vaccination and as a critical target in future influenza vaccine plat-
forms.
Further assays on samples from this study including microneu-
tralization, HA stalk antibody detection, immunophenotyping,
and other immunologic assays will further strengthen and clarify
the results observed here, and we believe it is critical to approach
these questions in future laboratory studies. These data will also
likely lead to future clinical studies that must be done to identify
and confirm other correlates of protection beside anti-surface gly-
coprotein antibody titers and to develop a more refined under-
standing of the correlates of protection from influenza infection.
Challenge studies such as this will continue to offer a well-
controlled environment in which to study these factors in a
unique setting where pre- and postchallenge immunity is known,
the viral phenotype is controlled, timing and dose of infection are
known, and serial sampling is possible.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design. A healthy volunteer challenge study was performed at the
NIH Clinical Center after participants signed informed consent. The pri-
mary objective was to determine whether participants with a high prechal-
lenge serum HAI titer were less likely to develop mild to moderate influ-
enza disease (MMID) after intranasal inoculation with a wild-type
influenza A/H1N1pdm virus compared to participants with a low pre-
challenge HAI titer. MMID was defined as viral shedding detected by
clinical molecular testing, plus a minimum of one symptom of influenza
after intranasal challenge, as previously described (19).
Participants with HAI titers of �1:40 or �1:40 prechallenge under-
went a 9-day inpatient quarantine and intranasal challenge via a nasal
atomizer with a 107 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) dose of the
H1N1pdm influenza challenge. Participants were assessed daily during
their inpatient stay and monitored for 2 months after discharge as
previously described (19). In addition, all participants performed self-
assessment using the Flu-PRO (27) questionnaire twice per day for
14 days to generate a symptom severity score. The study was performed in
a blind manner (all participants were unaware of their baseline HAI and
NAI titers). This study (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01971255) was
approved by the NIAID Institutional Review Board and was conducted in
accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and good
clinical practice guidelines.
Immunological and virological assays. HAI titers were measured
against the genetically identical challenge virus, and NAI titers were mea-
sured using an assay virus with a genetically identical NA gene compared
to the challenge virus using standard methods as reported previously (9,
28). All measurements were made in triplicate. Nasal washes were ana-
lyzed for viral shedding using a one-step real-time quantitative reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) for the influenza A virus matrix 1 gene (29).
A standard curve with an external standard was used to calculate copy
number as previously described (19).
Statistical analysis. The proportion with the primary outcome,
MMID, was compared between the HAI titer groups in a modified intent
to treat analysis (mITT) that excluded individuals who enrolled in the

 study and received challenge virus but were found to have a positive test
for a virus other than influenza (Fig. 1). This was done to maintain the
integrity of the study by eliminating any confounding infections. Analysis
was also performed to evaluate the presence or absence of symptoms
regardless of viral shedding. Four measures of disease severity were ana-
lyzed, including symptom severity score (Flu-PRO self-assessment),
number of symptoms, symptom duration, and shedding duration. Symp-
tom severity scores were normalized relative to baseline by subtracting
prechallenge scores (maintaining a minimum score of 0). Binary out-
comes were compared using the Fisher exact test, and continuous out-
comes were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.
In addition, we performed the same analyses after grouping partici-
pants by baseline NAI titers into groups with baseline titers of �1:40 and
�1:40. Independent of the assigned groups, we performed two variable
correlations to all four disease severity measures to both NAI and baseline
HAI titers using the nonparametric Spearman’s correlation coefficient
and performed multiple regression analysis using a linear model to exam-
ine independent effects of HAI and NAI titer on disease severity out-
comes. All tests were two sided and at the 0.05 significance level. Statistical
analyses were performed using R (version 3.0.1) (R Development Core
Team, Vienna, Austria) and GraphPad Prism software (version 6.0h;
GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).
