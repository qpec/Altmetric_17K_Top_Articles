Abstract
Background: It has been suggested that an increasing number of Japanese adults remain sexually inexperienced;
however, no study has assessed this issue using nationally representative data.
Methods: We used data from seven rounds of the National Fertility Survey of Japan, 1987–2015, and included
adults aged 18–39 years (18–34 years in the 1987 survey) in the analyses (sample size 11,553–17,850 [1987–2010];
response rate 70.0–92.5%). For each survey year, sex and age group, we estimated the age-adjusted prevalence of
heterosexual inexperience, defined as reporting no experience of sexual intercourse with someone of the opposite
sex. We used logistic regression, adjusted for age, to identify factors associated with heterosexual inexperience in
the 2010 survey. Information about same-sex sexual experience was not available.
Results: Between 1992 and 2015, the age-standardized prevalence of heterosexual inexperience in adults aged 18–
39 years increased from 21.7 to 24.6% for women (p-values for linear and quadratic trend < 0.05) and from 20.0 to
25.8% for men (p-values for trend < 0.05). Among those aged 30–34 years, the prevalence was 6.2% in 1987 and 11.
9% in 2015 for women (p-values for trend ≥0.05) and 8.8% (1987) and 12.7% (2015) for men (p-values for trend ≥0.
05). Among those aged 35–39 years, prevalence increased from 4.0% in 1992 to 8.9% in 2015 among women (p-
values for trend < 0.05). The corresponding numbers for men in the same age group were 5.5 and 9.5%,
respectively (p-values for trend ≥0.05). Among men aged 25–39 years, unemployment, temporary/part-time
employment and lower income were associated with heterosexual inexperience.
Conclusions: The proportion of young Japanese adults with no experience of heterosexual intercourse had
increased in the past two decades. Among adults in their thirties, around one in ten had no heterosexual
experience. Unemployment, temporary/part-time employment and low income were associated with heterosexual
inexperience among men. Further research is needed on the factors contributing to and the potential public health
and demographic implications of the high proportion of the Japanese population that remains sexually
inexperienced well into adult age.

 Background
Japan’s total fertility rate is among the lowest in the
world, and the Japanese population is predicted to fall by
a third by 2060 [1]. While declines in stable employment
opportunities and difficulties combining full-time work
with child-rearing are commonly mentioned as expla-
nations for the low birth rates, [2] it has also been
suggested that a decline in sexual activity among the
country’s young adults has contributed to the demo-
graphic decline [3–7].
In the 2015 National Fertility Survey, more than 40%
of
never-married
18–34-year-old
women
and
men
responded that they have never had sexual intercourse
with someone of the opposite sex [8]. Comparisons with
previous surveys indicated that this proportion had in-
creased in recent years [8]. Although many sexually ac-
tive individuals do not have children and some women
may conceive without a male sexual partner, heterosex-
ual
intercourse
is
the
main
method
of
human
reproduction; consequently, sexual inexperience in a
large part of the population may affect fertility rates.
Moreover, sexual health and satisfaction are key compo-
nents of human health, well-being and life satisfaction
[9–12]. The purported increase in individuals who re-
main sexually inexperienced well into adulthood has be-
come a national concern [3–7] and may have important
demographic and public health implications.
Important knowledge gaps regarding sexual inexperi-
ence among young Japanese adults remain. Previous
analyses have been limited to never-married individuals;
thus, the prevalence of heterosexual inexperience in the
whole population, also including those who are married,
is unknown. In addition, prevalence of sexual inexperi-
ence among never-married individuals is not comparable
across years as the average age of marriage and marriage
rates have changed over the past decades [13]. Accord-
ingly, the size and potential changes over time of the
proportion of the population that is heterosexually inex-
perienced have not been investigated.
In this study, we used nationally representative data
from seven rounds of the National Fertility Survey, 1987
to 2015, to estimate age-standardized prevalence of het-
erosexual inexperience in the general population, investi-
gate the number and characteristics of inexperienced
individuals, and assess socioeconomic and regional fac-
tors associated with heterosexual inexperience.
Methods
Data sources
We used data from rounds 9 to 15 of the National Fertil-
ity Survey, conducted in 1987, 1992, 1997, 2002, 2005,
2010, and 2015. The survey is carried out by the Na-
tional Institute of Population and Social Security Re-
search (IPSS), under the Japanese Ministry of Health,
Labour, and Welfare, to collect nationally representative
data on topics related to marriage and child birth in
Japan, [8, 14] as described in Additional file 1. In brief,
each survey used stratified cluster sampling with districts
in the Population Census of Japan as primary sampling
units and comprised two national sub-surveys: one for
married couples in which the wife was under 50 years of
age, and one for unmarried women and men between 18
and 49 years of age (except the 1987 survey of unmarried
adults which only included those aged 18–34 years) [8].
Through home visits, participants were provided with
a self-administered questionnaire which was returned
upon completion in a sealed envelope at a follow-up
visit. The response rate across survey years ranged
between 70.0 and 83.8% among unmarried individuals
and between 85.7 and 92.5% among the married cou-
ples [8].
Use of data on stratification and primary sampling
units was not approved by IPSS due to constraints on
secondary data usage. As these variables are needed to
calculate confidence intervals that account for the strati-
fied cluster sampling, confidence intervals in our ana-
lyses should be interpreted with caution. (Additional file
1) We obtained information about the number of indi-
viduals in the Japanese population by age, sex and mari-
tal status from the Population Census of Japan (1985–
2015) [13]; these data were used to weight the sample to
ensure that it was broadly representative of the Japanese
population with respect to sex, age and marital status, as
described below.
Study population
We used individual-level data from the surveys con-
ducted between 1987 and 2010 and summary data from
the 2015 survey report published by IPSS [8] as use of
individual-level data in the 2015 survey was not ap-
proved by IPSS. We included married and unmarried
women and men, aged between 18 and 39 years. We ex-
cluded unmarried participants with unknown status of
heterosexual experience as defined below. Across the
surveys from 1987 to 2010, the proportion of those ex-
cluded ranged from 2 to 7% (5 to 12% of the unmarried
participants) among women and from 2 to 7% (4 to 11%
of the unmarried participants) among men. The charac-
teristics of excluded participants were largely similar to
the unmarried participants with known heterosexual ex-
perience status who were included in the analyses
(Additional file 1: Tables S1 and S2). The final sample
size of the surveys from 1987 to 2010 ranged between
11,553 (5787 unmarried) and 17,850 (8243 unmarried).
(Additional file 1: Table S3).
We used sample weights to adjust for differential
probabilities of non-response and unknown status of
heterosexual experience by age, sex and marital status.

 Sample weights were calculated as the inverse of the
probability of being sampled according to age, sex and
marital status based on data from the Population Census
of Japan [13] as described in the Additional file 1.
Definition of sexual inexperience
The main outcome was heterosexual inexperience (yes/
no). We assumed that all married participants and un-
married participants who had been previously married
had heterosexual experience [15]. The sub-survey of un-
married participants included the question, “Have you
ever had sexual intercourse with someone of the oppos-
ite sex?” Never-married participants who answered “no”
to this question were categorized as sexually inexperi-
enced and those who answered “yes” were categorized as
having heterosexual experience. The wording of the
question was consistent in all surveys; in the 2005 and
2015 surveys, the question was asked together with
questions about contraception and in the 2005 survey,
participants could specify whether they had experience
from intercourse within the past year. (Additional file 1:
Table S4) The Japanese term for sexual intercourse (sei-
kosho) that was included in the survey is commonly used
to refer to vaginal intercourse. The survey did not con-
tain questions about same-sex sexual experience, and
same-sex marriage is not established in Japan; our ana-
lyses were therefore limited to heterosexual intercourse.
Statistical methods
All analyses were stratified by sex and performed in
Stata version 14.0 (StataCorp LP, College Town, TX) and
R version 3.3.2. For each survey from 1987 to 2010, we
used sample weights that were standardized to the age
distribution of 2015, as described in Additional file 1, to
estimate age-standardized prevalence of heterosexual in-
experience for the full age range (18–39 years) and by
age group (18–19; 20–24; 25–29; 30–34; and 35–39
years) in the total and never-married populations. Preva-
lence for ages 18–39 years and 35–39 years were not es-
timated
for
1987
as
this
survey
did
not
include
unmarried participants older than 34 years. Because indi-
vidual level data were not available for the 2015 survey,
we used summary data provided in the survey report [8]
and marital status data taken from the 2015 Population
Census of Japan to estimate the prevalence, as described
in Additional file 1. These estimates were directly com-
parable to those of the years 1987–2010 as they were
based on the same survey question and census data (as
shown in Additional file 1); however, confidence inter-
vals could not be calculated. Linear and quadratic trends
in prevalence across the survey years were assessed
using linear regression, for which p-values of less than
0.05 were regarded as statistically significant.
Next, we determined the proportion of heterosexually
inexperienced women and men using the 2010 survey
(the most recent survey for which individual-level data
were available). We applied sample weights (without
age-standardization, as described in Additional file 1) to
extrapolate population characteristics, by heterosexual
experience status, to Japan’s 16.33 million women and
16.86 million men, aged 18–39 years in 2010 [13]. We
selected, a priori, variables that we hypothesized could
be associated with sexual inexperience: education, occu-
pational status, annual income, region of residence
and population size/density of residence [16–18]; the
definitions and categorizations of these variables are
shown in Additional file 1: Table S8. Among those
who were sexually inexperienced, we calculated the
proportion who responded that they desire marriage
in their lifetime.
Finally, we analysed the association between the se-
lected variables and heterosexual inexperience using
2010 survey data. We employed logistic regression, ac-
counting for sample weights, to calculate age-adjusted
odds ratios (aORs), with heterosexual inexperience as
the binary dependent variable (1 = heterosexually inex-
perienced; 0 = heterosexually experienced). We adjusted
for age as a continuous variable. We conducted the ana-
lyses by age group (18–24 years and 25–39 years) be-
cause associations between the assessed variables and
sexual inexperience are likely to differ by age. Partici-
pants with missing data on the investigated variables
were few and excluded from the analyses by variable:
education (weighted proportion 1.1%), occupational sta-
tus (4.2%), annual income (3.2%) and desire for marriage
during the lifetime (4.6% among those with no hetero-
sexual experience). The study was approved by the Re-
gional Ethics Committee at The University of Tokyo,
Japan. Informed consent was not required for secondary
use of data from the National Fertility Survey.
Results
Age-standardized prevalence of heterosexual
inexperience, 1987–2015
The overall age-standardized prevalence of sexual inex-
perience among women aged 18–39 years had increased
from 21.7% in 1992 to 24.6% in 2015 (p-values for linear
and quadratic trend < 0.05). (Fig. 1 and Additional file 1:
Table S9) When analysed by age group, the highest
prevalence was observed in 1987 among those aged 18–
19 years (80.7%) and 20–24 years (55.5%); the prevalence
then decreased, reaching its lowest levels in 2002 (18–
19 years, 65.1%) and 2005 (20–24 years, 36.0%), at which
point it increased again (prevalence in 2015: 18–19 years,
77.5%; 20–24 years, 44.4%; p-values for trend < 0.05). In
those aged 30–34 years, prevalence almost doubled dur-
ing the study period, from 6.2% in 1987 to 11.9% in

 2015, although this increase was not statistically signifi-
cant (p-values for trend ≥0.05). Similarly, in those aged
35–39 years, prevalence increased from 4.0% in 1992 to
8.9% in 2015 (p-values for trend < 0.05). (Fig. 2 and
Additional file 1: Table S9).
Among men, the age-standardized prevalence in those
aged 18–39 years had increased from 20.0% in 1992 to
25.8% in 2015 (p-values for linear and quadratic trend <
0.05). (Fig. 1 and Additional file 1: Table S10) In the
younger age groups, prevalence decreased between 1987

 (18–19 years, 74.9%; 20–24 years, 41.9%) and 2002 (18–
19 years, 66.1%; 20–24 years, 34.2%), after which it in-
creased (prevalence in 2015: 18–19 years, 75.1%; 20–24
years, 46.6%; p-values for trend < 0.05). (Fig. 3 and Add-
itional file 1: Table S10) In the oldest age groups, preva-
lence rose nominally during the study period: from 8.8%
in 1987 to 12.7% in 2015 among those aged 30–34 years
(p-values for trend ≥0.05), and from 5.5% in 1992 to
9.5% in 2015 among those aged 35–39 years (p-values
for trend ≥0.05). (Fig. 3 and Additional file 1: Table S10).
Population characteristics and age-adjusted odds ratios in
2010
The characteristics of the participants in the 2010 Na-
tional Fertility Survey are shown in Additional file 1:
Table S11, and the sample-weighted extrapolation of the
results to the Japanese population are shown in Table 1
(18–39 years), Additional file 1: Table S12 (18–24 years)
and Additional file 1: Table S13 (25–39 years). Mean
(SD) age was 30.0 (6.3) years for women and 30.0
(6.2) years for men, and 44.4% of women and 36.6%
of men were married. A larger proportion of women
(25.3%)
than
men
(6.6%)
were
unemployed
while
more men (61.7%) than women (32.3%) were regular
employees. In total, 3.26 million women and 3.80 mil-
lion men, aged 18–39 years, were estimated in 2010
to have no heterosexual experience. (Table 1) Of
those without heterosexual experience, 85.8% of the
women and 82.8% of the men responded that they
desire
marriage
during
their
lifetimes.
(Table
1)
Among those without heterosexual experience aged
25–39, this proportion was 81.0% for women and
78.2% for men.
In the logistic regression analyses, several factors as-
sociated with heterosexual inexperience were identi-
fied. (Table 2) For example, among men aged 25–39
years, part-time or temporary employment (aOR vs.
regular employee, 3.82 [95% CI, 3.04 to 4.80]) and
unemployment (aOR, 7.87 [95% CI, 6.06 to 10.23])
were associated with a higher likelihood of being het-
erosexually inexperienced. Conversely, among women,
unemployment was associated with a lower likelihood
of having no heterosexual experience. While the aOR
for heterosexual inexperience decreased with each in-
crease in annual income category among men, the
aOR was lowest in women with the least income. In
both sexes, the highest aORs for heterosexual inex-
perience were observed for those residing in the
Kanto, Kinki and Chubu regions, while the lowest
aORs were in Kyushu/Okinawa and Hokkaido. Com-
pared to non-densely inhabited areas, residence in a
densely inhabited area with over 1 million inhabitants
was associated with a lower likelihood of heterosexual
inexperience for men. The directions of the associa-
tions were largely similar among 18–24-year-olds, al-
though there was no trend of a higher likelihood of
heterosexual inexperience among women with higher
income, and the Kanto (men and women), Hokkaido
(women) and Chugoku/Shikoku (women) regions had
the highest aORs.

 Discussion
Sexual activity is a key component of human fertility
and well-being [9–12]. In the face of low fertility rates
and a shrinking population, sexual inexperience among
young adults in Japan has been subject to concern and
speculation [3–6]. Our study expands on available data
on heterosexual inexperience in Japan by providing na-
tional estimates of prevalence by age group and by asses-
sing socioeconomic and regional factors associated with
having no heterosexual experience.
Between 1992 and 2015, age-standardized prevalence
of heterosexual inexperience had increased among Japa-
nese adults aged 18–39 years. In 2015, prevalence was
11.9% (women) and 12.7% (men) in those aged 30–34
years, and 8.9% (women) and 9.5% (men) in those aged
35–39 years; these numbers translate to 1.56 million
adults in their thirties who had never engaged in hetero-
sexual intercourse.
While national surveys on sexual behaviour in other
high-income countries in Asia are scarce, data on sexual
inexperience
are
available
for
some
non-Asian
high-income countries, e.g., the UK, [19] the US, [20]
Australia, [18] Denmark [21] and New Zealand [22].
Compared to adults in these countries, [18–22] our re-
sults indicate that Japanese adults tend to become sexu-
ally active later in life and that a substantially larger
proportion remain heterosexually inexperienced into
their thirties. For example, in the nationally representa-
tive Natsal-3 study in the UK, (2011, 19] the proportion
of women who reported no sexual partners of the op-
posite sex (defined as someone with whom the survey
participant had engaged in vaginal, oral or anal inter-
course) over the lifetime was 19.8% (16–24 years), 2.6%
(25–34 years) and 0.5% (35–44 years); the corresponding
numbers for men were 19.8, 5.2 and 1.5% [19]. In the
2006–2008 National Survey of Family Growth in the US,
[20] the proportion of women reporting no sexual part-
ners of the opposite sex after the age of 18 years were
12.6% (20–24 years), 3.4% (25–29 years), 1.9% (30–34
years) and 0.9% (35–39 years); the corresponding num-
bers for men were 14.4, 3.8, 3.1 and 1.4% [20]. In a na-
tionally representative survey in Australia (2012–2013),
the proportion of the population reporting no experi-
ence of vaginal intercourse was 40.0% (16–19 years),
10.9% (20–29 years) and 1.2% (30–39 years) for women
and 35.0% (16–19 years), 9.6% (20–29 years) and 1.8%
(30–39 years) for men [18]. The reasons for the substan-
tially larger proportion of Japanese adults who report no
heterosexual experience, as compared with those in
other high-income countries, remain to be investigated.
Some of those who reported no heterosexual experi-
ence in our study most likely have experience from
same-sex sexual activities. Studies from other countries
show that between 2 and 5% of the population identify
as having a sexual orientation other than heterosexual,
[19, 20] although some of these individuals may have en-
gaged in heterosexual intercourse and not all of them
have same-sex sexual experience. Nonetheless, even if
5% of the young adults in Japan were to have engaged in
same-sex sexual activities without ever having had het-
erosexual
intercourse,
around
one
in
twenty
30-to-39-year-old women and men, according to our
findings, would still lack sexual experience.
While positive sexual experiences are important con-
tributors to quality of life, [9–12] some individuals may
not consider the absence of sex as a source of dissatis-
faction. In the Natsal-3 study in the UK, a substantial
proportion of those with previous experience of sexual
activity who had been sexually inactive in the year pre-
ceding survey participation did not report dissatisfaction
with their (lack of) sex life [23]. Similarly, in a US study,
those who had been sexually inactive for a year reported
similar levels of happiness as their sexually active coun-
terparts [16]. In Japan, it has been reported that some
adults do not consider intimate relationships as being of
high priority in their lives, with financial insecurity and

 long working hours possibly contributing to the pur-
ported trend [3, 24, 25]. The choice of not pursuing in-
timate relationships is gaining attention and acceptance,
being described using terms such as “soshokukei-dan-
shi”(herbivore men) and “sekkusu-banare” (drifting away
from sex) [3, 24, 25]. However, difficulties in finding sex-
ual partners may also explain sexual inexperience. In
fact, around 80% of women and men aged 25–39 years
who reported no heterosexual experience in our study
responded that they wished to get married in their life-
time, indicating that their lack of sexual experience may
be involuntary. The associations between several socio-
economic/regional variables and sexual inexperience in
our study further supported this notion. Importantly,
while the negative association of low income and un-
employment with sexual inexperience among women
aged 25–39 years could be explained by the relatively
high proportion of married women who are housewives,
[26] lower income as well as unstable or no employment
were strongly associated with sexual inexperience among
men. Although low income and the lack of sexual op-
portunity may share common determinants, these find-
ings are in line with studies showing that high [27, 28]
and stable [27] incomes are important predictors of at-
tractiveness in the mating market, especially for men [8,
29]. Indeed, income is associated with marriage among
Japanese men, [30] and it has been suggested that the
decrease in stable employment opportunities over recent
decades has contributed to low marriage and fertility
rates in Japan [7, 31]. Japan’s low fertility rates persist
despite the government’s efforts to encourage marriage,
pregnancy and child rearing, including matchmaking
events, fertility education programs and policies to im-
prove work-life balance and childcare [2]. The situation
of individuals who remain sexually inexperienced due to
difficulties in finding a partner, as highlighted by our
findings, may be considered in future policies aimed at
increasing Japan’s birth rate.
Our study has limitations. First, as our analyses relied
on self-reported data, results might be affected by under-
or over-reporting of heterosexual inexperience due to
social desirability bias; [32] however, the risk of such a
bias may have been mitigated by the survey’s use of
self-administered questionnaires [33]. Second, although
the response rate in the National Fertility Survey was
high (70.0 to 83.8% among unmarried persons and 85.7
to 92.5% among married couples) [8] and the sample
was weighted to ensure that it was broadly representa-
tive of the Japanese population with respect to sex, age
and marital status, non-response may have introduced
bias into our findings. Third, data on stratification and
sampling units used in the surveys were not available.
While this did not affect the point estimates, [34, 35] the
standard errors of the estimated prevalence and odds
ratios could potentially have been influenced: the lack of
stratification data may have led to an overestimation of
the standard error, and the omission of sampling units
may have underestimated the standard error [34, 35].
Confidence intervals in our analyses should therefore be
interpreted with caution. Fourth, although the term sei-
kosho used in the question regarding sexual experience
is commonly used to refer to vaginal intercourse, the
definition of this term was not specified in the survey
and may have been interpreted differently by some par-
ticipants. Fifth, our analyses underestimate the level of
sexual inactivity in the population as those who have
previous sexual experience may still be sexually inactive.
Sexual inactivity may be more informative to assess than
sexual inexperience with respect to the implications for
fertility and public health. Sixth, as individual-level data
were not available for the 2015 survey, we assessed fac-
tors associated with heterosexual inexperience in the
2010 survey. Seventh, as the question regarding sexual
inexperience was only asked to unmarried individuals,
we assumed that those who were or had been married
had heterosexual experience; this may have led to an
underestimation of sexual inexperience. Finally, as the
information provided in the National Fertility Survey
was limited to heterosexual experience, we could not as-
sess same-sex sexual experience. There is a dearth of
data on gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender groups in
Japan, [36] and questions targeted to the experiences of
these groups should be included in future surveys.
Conclusions
In this study using nationally representative survey data
from Japan, we found that the proportion of men and
women who reported no experience of heterosexual
intercourse had increased in the past two decades.
Around one in ten women and men remained hetero-
sexually inexperienced into their thirties. Among men,
temporary or part-time employment, unemployment
and low income were associated with a higher likelihood
of having no heterosexual experience. Further research
is needed on the factors contributing to and the poten-
tial public health and demographic implications of the
high proportion of young adults in Japan who remain
sexually inexperienced well into adult age.
