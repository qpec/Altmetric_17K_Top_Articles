n December 2012, I was the lead author of a review published in The Journal of the 
American Osteopathic Association that focused on an emerging botanical agent called 
kratom.1 The species, Mitragyna speciosa, is a tree indigenous to Thailand and other 
areas of Southeast Asia.2 When ingested or consumed in the form of teas, kratom leaves 
produce complex dose-dependent stimulant and analgesic effects.1 In Southeast Asia, 
kratom has been used to stave off fatigue and to manage pain, diarrhea, cough, and opioid 
withdrawal.2-6 Our analyses of the medical literature and websites in 2012 revealed that 
kratom had been increasingly used for the self-management of opioid withdrawal and pain 
in the United States. We also reported on the pharmacologically active constituents of kra-
tom, most notably mitragynine, 7-hydroxymitragynine, paynantheine, and speciogynine, 
along with more than 20 other substances.1,3 These compounds have complex and poten-
tially useful pharmacologic activities. In addition, we found many anecdotal reports and 
testimonials posted online suggesting that kratom may have beneficial effects, particularly 
in the management of both opioid withdrawal and pain.1
 
At the time our review was published, kratom was not banned by the US Drug Enforce-
ment Administration (DEA), although it was on their Drugs and Chemicals of Concern 
watch list.1,7 We summarized the potential therapeutic benefits of kratom, but we also em-
phasized that no well-controlled scientific studies on the safety and efficacy of kratom had 
Update on the Pharmacology 
and Legal Status of Kratom
Walter C. Prozialeck, PhD
Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) is a plant indigenous to Southeast Asia. Its 
leaves and the teas brewed from them have long been used by people in that 
region to stave off fatigue and to manage pain and opioid withdrawal. In a 
comprehensive review published in 2012, Prozialeck et al presented evidence 
that kratom had been increasingly used for the self-management of opioid 
withdrawal and pain in the United States. At the time, kratom was classified 
as a legal herbal product by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. Recent 
studies have confirmed that kratom and its chemical constituents do have 
useful pharmacologic actions. However, there have also been increasing 
numbers of reports of adverse effects resulting from use of kratom products. 
In August 2016, the US Drug Enforcement Administration announced plans 
to classify kratom and its mitragynine constituents as Schedule 1 controlled 
substances, a move that triggered a massive response from kratom advo-
cates. The purpose of this report is to highlight the current scientific and legal 
controversies regarding kratom.

search conducted in October 2016 showed that 44 addi-
tional articles had been published. Results of several 
analyses4,11,12 published within the past year indicate that 
large numbers of people are using kratom for the man-
agement of opioid withdrawal and pain. A cursory re-
view of the many patient comments on websites such as 
The Vaults of Erowid,13 Sage Wisdom,14 and Speciosa15 
indicates that many users believe that kratom has been a 
relatively safe and effective way to manage these condi-
tions. However, no controlled clinical trials on the safety 
and efficacy of kratom have been published. At the same 
time, increasing numbers of adverse effects and toxic 
reactions associated with the use of kratom products 
have been reported.8,16,17
 
It was in the context of these uncertainties regarding 
safety and efficacy of kratom that, in August 2016, the 
DEA announced its plans to move kratom and mitragy-
nines to Schedule 1 status.8 This category includes drugs 
such as heroin and LSD, which have no valid medical 
uses and a high potential for abuse. The DEA’s an-
nouncement sparked vigorous opposition from many 
patients and patient advocacy groups who claim that 
kratom had helped them manage opioid withdrawal or 
chronic pain.9-11,18,19 The advocates’ responses included a 
march and demonstration at the White House on Sep-
tember 13, 2016, and a petition with over 130,000 signa-
tures that was sent to President Barack Obama. In 
addition, several congressional representatives and US 
senators signed letters asking the DEA to reconsider the 
kratom ban, which was to go into effect on September 
30, 2016.20,21 In response to these challenges, the director 
of the DEA announced that the kratom ban would be 
temporarily placed on hold.21-23 All of these events have 
received extensive coverage by news media and have 
raised public awareness of the issue. As a result of my 
familiarity with kratom, I have been contacted by several 
news reporters and writers for my thoughts and opinions 
about the kratom controversy.9-11,18,19 Even though there 
are far more questions than answers, I hope that I can 
accurately frame some of the most important questions. 
been published.1 We noted an increase in the number of 
reported adverse effects attributed to kratom and high-
lighted the lack of regulation and quality-control 
measures in the production and sale of kratom products. 
Our conclusions from these analyses were that even 
though kratom or its active constituents could have po-
tential for development as therapeutic agents, it would 
not be appropriate for physicians to recommend kratom 
for their patients. 
 
In the 4 years since the review1 was published, sev-
eral major developments have been made regarding the 
pharmacology and legal status of kratom.8 Given the 
widespread use of kratom and the extensive media at-
tention it is receiving,8-11 it is important for physicians 
and other health care professionals to be knowledge-
able about the subject. The purpose of this review is to 
update readers about key developments in this rapidly 
evolving area. 
Legal Status of Kratom
The most controversial development regarding kratom is 
the recent decision by the DEA to classify kratom and the 
kratom-derived drugs, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitra-
gine, as Schedule 1 controlled substances.8 Over the 
years, kratom has been regulated as an herbal product 
under US Food and Drug Administration and DEA poli-
cies. As such, it has been considered a legal substance in 
most of the United States, although a handful of states, 
such as Alabama, Florida, Indiana, Arkansas, Wisconsin, 
and Tennessee, have recently passed legislation banning 
the local sale and possession of kratom.9,10 
 
Despite the uncertainties regarding the legal status of 
kratom, over the past 4 years it is apparent that kratom 
use in the United States has increased measurably. More 
than half of all literature on kratom has been published in 
just the past 4 years. In our 2012 review,1 we reported 
that a search of the US National Library of Medicine’s 
PubMed database, using the keyword kratom, yielded a 
total of 35 published articles and reviews. A similar

much like traditional opioids, they did not “recruit” 
β-arrestin-2, which has been implicated as a mediator 
of opioid side effects and dependence.30 Using a mouse 
model, Váradi et al28 showed that kratom-based drugs 
had marked analgesic effects but with far fewer side 
effects, slower development of tolerance, and lower 
potential for dependence than morphine. Based on all 
of the evidence, it is clear that kratom and its mitragy-
nine constituents are not opioids and that they should 
not be classified as such.
Is Kratom Effective for the Management  
of Opioid Withdrawal or Pain? 
The current epidemic of opioid abuse and addiction in 
the United States has recently been highlighted in sev-
eral major commentaries,31-33 and it has prompted ac-
tion by the federal government and the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention. The most decisive ac-
tion has been the development of new guidelines by the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the 
prescribing of opioids.34 In this environment, physi-
cians are being discouraged from prescribing opioids, 
especially for long-term use, and patients with chronic 
pain conditions are seeking alternatives.11,12 In addition, 
many patients who have taken opioids for chronic pain 
are seeking alternatives that lack the side effects and 
addiction potential of opioids.11,12 Many people have 
turned to kratom with the belief that it may provide an 
effective and reportedly safe alternative to prescription 
or street opioids. It should be emphasized that most of 
these claims are on websites such as The Vaults of 
Erowid,13 Sage Wisdom,14 and Speciosa.15 The few sci-
entific studies that have addressed this issue have been 
summaries of patient experiences or clinical reports.4,6,12 
Swogger et al12 conducted a systematic analysis of 
kratom user reports on The Vaults of Erowid website.13 
Whereas some users reported negative effects, particu-
larly nausea and vomiting, mainly from higher doses, 
the vast majority of users reported beneficial effects in 
the management of opioid withdrawal and pain, depres-
 
The 2 most obvious questions are “why is kratom so 
controversial?” and “why is the DEA planning to ban 
it?” From my analysis of the literature1 and the DEA’s 
announcement,8 it is readily apparent that the contro-
versies and the DEA’s position are based on the re-
ported opioidlike effects of kratom, questions about its 
toxicities and addictive potential, and uncertainties 
about its efficacy and safety in the management of 
opioid withdrawal and pain. 
Should Kratom or Its Mitragynine 
Constituents Be Classified as Opioids? 
In describing their rationale for banning kratom, the DEA 
emphasized that kratom and mitragynines have been 
 
reported to produce some opioidlike effects. Most of 
 
the scientific evidence that kratom may have opioidlike 
activity is derived from the results of animal studies and 
ligand-binding studies, which have suggested that 
 
mitragynines may interact with opioid receptors.1,3,24,25 
In addition, anecdotal reports and commentaries indi-
cate that some of the effects of kratom in humans re-
semble those of opioid agonist drugs.4,5,26 Although no 
well-controlled clinical trials have been done, strong 
evidence demonstrates that the effects of kratom are 
actually quite different from those of classic opi-
oids.4,5,26 For example, at low to moderate doses, kratom 
has mild stimulant properties, unlike opioids, which are 
mainly sedating. In addition, kratom does not usually 
produce an intense high or euphoria.1,2,13-15 Importantly, 
even at very high doses, kratom does not depress respi-
ration.4 At the molecular level, mitragynines are struc-
turally quite different from traditional opioids such as 
morphine.1,27 Moreover, recent studies indicate that 
even though the mitragynines can interact with opioid 
receptors, their molecular actions are different from 
those of opioids. In 2 elegant studies, Váradi et al28 and 
Kruegel et al29 showed that several mitragynine analogs 
acted as agonists at µ opioid receptors and antagonists 
at δ opioid receptors. Most notably, even though they 
activated the G-protein–mediated signaling pathway,

sion and anxiety. I find the many positive experiences on 
The Vaults of Erowid, Sage Wisdom, and Speciosa web-
sites to be compelling. In my opinion, the therapeutic 
potential of kratom is too large to be ignored. Well- 
controlled clinical trials on kratom or the many active 
compounds in kratom are needed to address this issue.
 
One strong piece of evidence suggesting that 
kratom may have extensive therapeutic potential is 
that several US patents have either been issued or are 
pending for companies and individuals who are inter-
ested in developing kratom-based drugs.35-37 These 
patents would not have been submitted or issued un-
less there was evidence for medicinal applications of 
kratom-derived substances. 
 
Before considering the potential use of kratom in the 
management of opioid withdrawal, several major thera-
peutic controversies need to be addressed. Many kratom 
advocates have claimed that kratom is a safe and effec-
tive alternative to opioids for the management of opioid 
withdrawal.4,13 However, some addiction treatment spe-
cialists have noted that kratom may be a “crutch” or a 
“gateway” drug that can increase the likelihood that indi-
viduals will graduate to hard-core opioids such as 
heroin.10 In this regard, it is not clear how kratom would 
be any different from agents such as methadone and bu-
prenorphine, which are widely used as maintenance 
agents in the management of opioid withdrawal even 
with their great potential for abuse.38 This issue is at the 
center of a major debate in addiction medicine. Should 
the goal of treatment be abstinence or harm reduction?39 
If the goal is harm reduction, kratom may have a poten-
tial role, especially because kratom is less toxic than 
drugs such as methadone.
How Serious Are the Abuse  
and Addiction Potentials of Kratom? 
Studies have shown that people may seek kratom for its 
mind-altering effects and, with long-term use, may be-
come dependent or addicted.25,40,41 Even though these 
reports indicate that the effects as well as withdrawal 
symptoms from kratom can resemble those of opioids, 
many users have reported that the subjective effects of 
kratom are different from those of opioids. As noted pre-
viously, low to moderate doses of kratom tend to be 
somewhat stimulating and do not produce the “high” or 
euphoric effects associated with opioids.4,12-15 In addition, 
many users have reported that withdrawal symptoms 
from kratom are much milder than symptoms from tradi-
tional opioids.4,13,41 Most notably, even at high doses, 
kratom does not depress respiration as do traditional 
opioids.4,41 Although kratom has potential for abuse and 
addiction, several investigators who closely examined 
these issues concluded that kratom is not as dangerous as 
traditional opioids and that the potential benefits may 
outweigh the risks.4,12,26,41
Are Kratom Products Safe? 
With the increasing use of kratom in recent years, the 
number of reports of adverse effects resulting from 
 
the use of purported adulterated “kratom” products has 
also been increasing.16,17,42,43 These reports were cited as 
one of the major concerns in the DEA’s decision to ban 
kratom.8 At low to moderate doses (5-10 g of raw leaves), 
the adverse effects vary markedly from one person to 
another, but they generally appear to be mild.1,4,16,41 
The most common effects are anxiety, irritability, nausea, 
and vomiting.1,12,16,41 More troubling have been reports of 
serious toxic reactions associated with high doses or the 
use of concentrated extracts. Some of the reported effects 
include tachycardia, seizures, and liver damage.44-48 
In addition, there have been several deaths attributed to 
the use of purported kratom products.8,16,43,49-51 
 
From the foregoing summary, it is understandable 
why the DEA would be concerned about the safety of 
kratom. However, several factors need to be considered 
in evaluating whether the DEA’s proposed ban is justi-
fied. First are the simple statistics. When it announced 
the decision to ban kratom, the DEA emphasized that 
between January 2010 and December 2015, 660 calls 
had been made to poison control centers regarding

Discussion 
It is readily apparent that kratom is being widely used 
in the United States, especially for the management of 
opioid withdrawal and pain. Reports from kratom 
users and limited basic science and clinical studies 
suggest that kratom and its constituent compounds 
may have beneficial pharmacologic effects. However, 
no well-controlled clinical trials have been done. 
 
In response to growing concerns about the safety 
 
and addiction/abuse potential of kratom, the DEA is 
planning to classify kratom and its major mitragynine 
constituents as Schedule 1 controlled substances 
 
despite many patient reports and a few research 
studies that indicate that kratom is much less harmful 
than prescription opioids. While it is easy to understand 
the DEA’s perspective, it is also easy to understand the 
response by kratom users and many in the kratom 
 
research community. 
 
One point that is very clear is that these key issues 
can only be resolved through additional research. 
However, many experienced kratom researchers have 
expressed concern that the DEA’s plan to move kratom 
to Schedule 1 will almost certainly make it more dif-
ficult for investigators in the United States to address 
these issues.58 In this regard, the legal situation with 
kratom is similar to what has happened with so called 
“medical marijuana,” in which federal policies, in-
cluding its classification as a Schedule 1 substance, 
have impeded research.59 Many institutions and gov-
ernment agencies are reluctant to fund research on 
Schedule 1 substances. In addition, many practical 
issues complicate research on herbal products such as 
kratom. For example, after the publication of our re-
view in 2012,1 one of the coauthors, Shridhar An-
durkar, PhD, and I were planning on conducting basic 
research on the pharmacologic actions of kratom. 
With Dr Andurkar’s experience using animal models 
of opioid dependence and withdrawal, we hoped to 
develop a study to determine whether kratom could 
suppress symptoms of opioid withdrawal. However, 
adverse reactions to kratom products.8 This might seem 
to be an alarming number, but it is rather small consid-
ering that in 2014 alone, more than 28,000 people died of 
opioid poisoning.52 In addition, it is not totally clear how 
much of a factor kratom was in the few case reports in 
which it was implicated as a cause of death. In most of 
these case reports of possible fatal reactions to kratom, 
the patients may have had confounding health conditions 
or may have been using other drugs along with 
kratom.1,4,26,40 One of the major problems in evaluating 
the potential uses and safety of an herbal agent such as 
kratom is the lack of understanding how substances in 
kratom may interact with prescription medications, 
drugs of abuse, or herbal supplements.1,17 
 
The lack of regulations and standardization of the 
production and sale of adulterated kratom products com-
pounds the lack of understanding. Increasing evidence 
shows that unscrupulous purveyors of adulterated 
kratom may actually be contaminating their products 
with potentially toxic drugs.53-55 Probably the most noto-
rious example of such adulteration involved a product 
known as krypton, which was touted as a highly potent 
form of kratom. It was sold mainly in Europe and was 
found to be a factor in at least 9 deaths.47,56 However, 
detailed forensic analyses revealed that krypton con-
tained high amounts of the exogenous pharmaceutical 
agent O-desmethyltramadol, which has opioid and neu-
romodulator activity.56 Evidently, the exogenous O-des-
methyltramadol had been added to the plant material. 
Even though mitragynine was also detected in the prod-
ucts, it was not determined how the 2 substances may 
have interacted to cause death. The key point is that 
without some type of standardization and quality control, 
people who use adulterated kratom products cannot be 
sure what they are taking. This is obviously a problem 
that needs to be resolved. Nevertheless, several scientists 
who have studied kratom indicate that in its pure herbal 
form, it appears to be relatively benign, especially in 
comparison with opioids such as hydrocodone, oxyco-
done, and heroin.4,26,57

we soon realized that this would not be an easy issue 
to address. Which kratom product would we evaluate? 
How would we confirm that the product was actually 
kratom? Resolving that issue would necessitate evalu-
ation by a botanist. How would the product be stan-
dardized for activity when it contains a mixture of 
active compounds? One solution might be to focus on 
specific chemicals isolated from kratom, but then we 
would not be able to determine how all of the many 
active constituents in kratom might interact to produce 
effects that could differ from those of the individual 
constituents. Another major issue was how we would 
administer a plant material such as kratom to labora-
tory animals in a way that would naturally mimic 
human consumption. 
Conclusion
The only way kratom can be unequivocally studied is 
through well-controlled clinical trials in humans. Who 
would fund this type of study? Given that kratom is a 
tree, would pharmaceutical companies support such 
work? Would institutional review boards be reluctant to 
approve trials for a schedule 1 substance? Even though 
I have no answers to these complex questions, it is my 
sincere hope that this commentary will facilitate an in-
formed discussion about kratom and foster the neces-
sary research to resolve questions about the safety and 
utility of kratom in the management of opioid with-
drawal and pain. If kratom contains pharmacologically 
active compounds (which it clearly does), it would 
certainly have potential toxicities. After evaluating the 
literature, I can reach no other conclusion than, in pure 
herbal form, when taken at moderate doses of less than 
10 to 15 g, pure leaf kratom appears to be relatively 
benign in the vast majority of users. Without reported 
evidence, however, it would not be appropriate for phy-
sicians to recommend kratom for their patients. That 
said, physicians should be aware that their patients may 
be using kratom.
