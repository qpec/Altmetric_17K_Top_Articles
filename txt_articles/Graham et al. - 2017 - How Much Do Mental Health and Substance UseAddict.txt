Abstract
Objective: To measure service use and costs associated with health care for patients with mental health (MH) and substance
use/addiction (SA) problems.
Methods: A 5-year cross-sectional study (2007-2012) of administrative health care data was conducted (average annual sample
size ¼ 123,235 adults aged >18 years who had a valid Ontario health care number and used at least 1 service during the year; 55%
female). We assessed average annual use of primary care, emergency departments and hospitals, and overall health care costs for
patients identified as having MH only, SA only, co-occurring MH and SA problems (MHþSA), and no MH and/or SA (MH/SA)
problems. Total visits/admissions and total non-MH/SAvisits (i.e., excluding MH/SA visits) were regressed separately onMH, SA,
and MHþSA cases compared to non-MH/SA cases using the 2011-2012 sample (N ¼ 123,331), controlling for age and sex.
Results: Compared to non-MH/SA patients, MH/SA patients were significantly (P < 0.001) more likely to visit primary care
physicians (1.82 times as many visits for MH-only patients, 4.24 for SA, and 5.59 for MHþSA), use emergency departments
(odds, 1.53 [MH], 3.79 [SA], 5.94 [MHþSA]), and be hospitalized (odds, 1.59 [MH], 4.10 [SA], 7.82 [MHþSA]). MH/SA
patients were also significantly more likely than non-MH/SA patients to have non-MH/SA-related visits and accounted for 20%
of the sample but over 30% of health care costs.
Conclusions: MH and SA are core issues for all health care settings. MH/SA patients use more services overall and for non-
MH/SA issues, with especially high use and costs for MHþSA patients.

mental health, substance use, addiction, general medical services, service use, costs
The critical role of mental health (MH) in overall health is
well recognized,1 including a mental health action plan
developed by the World Health Organization2; however, the
extent that mental health contributes to use of general health
care services remains unclear. Even less is known regarding
co-occurring mental health and substance use/addiction (SA)
problems and how they are related to health service use.
Several studies have found that frequent emergency depart-
ment users may be more likely to have MH and/or SA (MH/
SA) problems compared to less frequent users.3-7 However,
most of these studies used small samples from a single hospital
or community, and a recent review8 concluded that findings
depend on factors such as location of the health care setting.
Evidence also indicates high rates of MH and SA problems
among frequent users of other medical services (e.g., primary
care).9,10 Again, these studies used small samples from a single
clinic or practice. One exception was a study of all health care
users in British Columbia,11 which found that frequent health
care users were more likely than less frequent users to be diag-
nosed with a psychosocial condition (including both MH and
SA); however, this study did not determine whether services
used were for psychosocial versus other health conditions.
The present research advances knowledge through 4
methodological enhancements to research in this area. First,
we used a large random sample of health care users to assess
a broad range of medical services used by persons who have
MH/SA problems. This allowed a more complete picture of
service use by persons with MH/SA problems than obtained
with previous studies examining only one type of service.
Second, we compared health care use patterns for persons
with MH, SA, and co-occurring MH and SA (MHþSA)
problems. MH and SA problems commonly co-occur,12-14
affecting service needs and use.15-21 Although some research
has examined outcomes for persons with co-occurring MH
and SA,22 no studies of general health care use have system-
atically compared use for persons with MH problems only,
SA only, MHþSA, and no MH/SA problems.
Third, we assessed whether persons with MH/SA problems
used health care services for MH/SA needs or for other health
issues. People who have MH/SA disorders are at higher risk of
physical health problems and are more likely to incur inten-
tional and unintentional injuries.1,9,23-26 They may also require
more extensive treatment for physical health problems27-30
compared to persons who do not have MH/SA disorders.
MH/SA problems can also hamper help seeking, diagnosis,
and treatment,1,31 possibly resulting in greater severity of
physical health problems. Thus, to better understand why peo-
ple with MH or SA problems are heavier users of medical
services, it is important to examine the extent of service use
for both MH/SA and non-MH/SA health problems.
Finally, we estimated overall medical service costs asso-
ciated with MH/SA problems. Other than 2 studies compar-
ing costs for psychiatric patients with and without
co-occurring substance use disorders,17,18 little is known
about the health care costs for MH/SA versus non-MH/SA
patients and the extent that costs are associated with MH or
SA only versus co-occurring MH and SA problems.

 2.
compare health care use by persons with MH only,
SA only, and MHþSA problems to a common con-
trol group of persons with no MH/SA problems; and
3.
assess the extent that services used by MH, SA, and
MHþSA patients addressed MH/SA versus non-MH/
SA problems.
Methods
We used a 5-year cross-sectional study design to examine 12-
month health care utilization among persons categorized as
having MH only, SA only, and both MH and SA (MHþSA)
problems compared to individuals not identified as having
MH or SA problems (non-MH/SA). This design allowed us
to focus on patients with current MH or SA problems (i.e.,
met criteria for MH or SA within a 12-month timeframe)
with replications across multiple years to increase robustness
of findings. We selected a random sample of 200,000 Ontario
residents who had a valid health insurance card (with uni-
versal health care, this includes almost all residents of
Ontario; population 13.6 million) for each fiscal year (begin-
ning on April 1 of each year), starting with 2007. We
excluded 40,849 individuals (averaged across the 5 years)
who did not use any of the health services included in the
study and 35,915 individuals (averaged across the 5 years)
who were younger than 19 years of age (the legal age for
alcohol consumption in Ontario). The resulting average sam-
ple size across the 5 years was 123,235 (55% female).
We used the administrative health databases at the Insti-
tute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) where patient-
level records pertaining to provincially funded medical ser-
vices are linked anonymously using unique encrypted iden-
tifiers. Specifically, we included: inpatient service
utilization from the Canadian Institute for Health Informa-
tion (CIHI), Discharge Abstract Database (DAD), and the
Ontario Mental Health Reporting System (OMHRS) data-
base (OMHRS records all hospitalizations in Ontario in
psychiatric-designated beds); emergency department visit
information from the CIHI National Ambulatory Care Reg-
istration System (NACRS) database; and physician visit data
from the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) database.
We used the Ontario Drug Benefits (ODB) database to cap-
ture methadone use for opioid maintenance treatment (ben-
efits available to persons aged 65þ, on social assistance,
etc.; http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/public/programs/
drugs/programs/sdp.aspx). Demographic information was
obtained from the Registered Persons Database (RPDB). The
study was approved by the Centre for Addiction and Mental
Health Research Ethics Board.
Case Ascertainment
Patients were classified as MH if they met at least one of the
following criteria: 1) a mental health–related discharge diag-
nosis from a general hospital bed (ICD-10 codes F20-F69),
2) a mental health–related diagnosis from a psychiatric
hospital bed (DSM-IV codes 295-298, 311, 300, or 301), 3)
a mental health– or self-harm–related emergency department
(ED) visit (ICD-10 codes F20-F69, X60-X84), or 4) an OHIP
billing claim for a mental health–related primary care phy-
sician or psychiatrist visit (based on a validated algorithm
developed by Steele et al.32). Dementia and delirium were
excluded because they involve medical as well as psychiatric
illnesses that often result in placement in long-term care.
Childhood disorders, including mental retardation/develop-
mental delay and autism, were also excluded.
SA case criteria included at least one of the following: 1)
a substance-related discharge diagnosis from a general hos-
pital bed (ICD-10 codes F10-F19, F55), 2) a substance-
related diagnosis from a psychiatric hospital bed (DSM-IV
code 303 or 304), 3) a substance-related ED visit (ICD-10
codes F10-F19, F55), 4) an OHIP billing claim with a
substance-related diagnosis (DSM-IV code 303 or 304), or
5) an ODB claim for methadone (only 15 SA cases were
uniquely identified by this criterion).
Persons were further categorized as MH only, SA only,
MHþSA, or non-MH/SA for comparison of service use
patterns.
Outcomes
For each of the 4 patient categories (MH only, SA only,
MHþSA, non-MH/SA), we calculated the average number of
primary care physician visits, ED visits, and hospitalizations
(both MH/SA and non-MH/SA related) across the 5 years. We
determined whether each visit/hospitalization was for MH/SA
using the same criteria used for case ascertainment. Visits coded
MH/SAmayhavealsoinvolvednon-MH/SAdiagnosesortreat-
ments in addition to MH/SA, while those coded ‘‘non-MH/SA’’
included only visits that did not involve any MH or SA. We
measured annual total costs (in Canadian dollars) for all services
delivered to each person and paid for by the health care system
using the algorithm developed by Wodchis et al.33 and com-
monly used for cost analyses.34 This algorithm includes measur-
ing the cost of services based on individual utilization and
associated fees paid by the government. When individual costs
are not available (e.g., for institutional settings), it allocates
institutional costs to individual visits or admissions. Thus, costs
include the 3 main outcomes for the present study as well as any
other costs billed to the health care system.
Statistical Analyses
Descriptive statistics were computed for each outcome across
the 4 MH/SA groups and averaged across the 5 years. Nega-
tive binomial regression models were used to compare groups
for number of primary care visits per person for the final year
of the sample (2011-2012). These analyses model the log of
the expected count (i.e., number of visits) as a linear function
of the predictor variables. The coefficients obtained were
exponentiated to obtain rate ratios and confidence intervals.
ED visits and hospitalizations were converted to dichotomous
50

 variables (1 ¼ any visit/hospitalization, 0 ¼ no visit/hospita-
lization) because of their highly skewed distributions and
were regressed onto the categorical variable reflecting the 4
MH/SA groups using logistic regression. All regression mod-
els adjusted for age and sex. Although we present regression
results for 2011-2012 in this article, separate regression mod-
els were calculated for each year and showed similar findings.
Data were analyzed using SAS Version 9.2 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Table 1 shows demographic characteristics and overall costs
for each group averaged across the 5 years. Similar results
were found for each year, reflecting no major changes in the
health care system during that period. As shown in the table,
more women than men were in the MH group, while more
men than women were in the SA and MHþSA groups. Aver-
age age for the MH group was similar to the non-MH/SA
group (about 48-49 years); however, SA patients were about
5 years younger and MHþSA patients about 7 years younger
than those in the non-MH/SA group. About 20% of the sam-
ple met criteria for MH/SA, with most classified as MH
problems only (18%) and less than 2% having service use
involving SA (0.71% SA and 0.90% MHþSA). Per capita
costs were about double for MH-only and SA-only patients
compared to non-MH/SA patients and more than 3 times for
MHþSA patients. Overall, MH/SA patients accounted for
over 30% of total health care costs.
Number of Primary Care Physician Visits, ED Visits,
and Hospital Admissions
Mean numbers of primary care physician visits, ED visits,
and hospital admissions for MH, SA, MHþSA, and non-
MH/SA patients averaged over the 5 years are shown in
Figures 1 to 3, respectively. Rate and odds ratios of service
use for MH, SA, and MHþSA compared to non-MH/SA
patients and results of statistical significance tests, control-
ling for sex and age, are shown in Table 2.
Each bar in Figure 1 shows the total annual mean number
of visits to a primary care physician by whether the person
was classified as MH, SA, MHþSA, or non-MH/SA. As
shown in Figure 1, MHþSA patients visited primary care
physicians most often (annual mean of 24.92 visits) followed
by SA (15.72), MH (11.80), and non-MH/SA (6.53). Most
visits for MHþSA and SA patients were for MH/SA reasons
(64% and 57%, respectively—shown as the grey part of the
bar), whereas only 27% of visits were for MH for patients in
the MH group.
Figure 2 shows that MHþSA patients visited the emer-
gency department most frequently (mean of 2.48 visits per
year), followed by SA (1.33 visits), MH (0.69 visits), and
non-MH/SA (0.42 visits). For all MH/SA groups, a third or
less of visits related to MH/SA (10% for MH, 27% for SA,
and 33% for MHþSA).
The results shown in Figure 3 for hospitalizations indicate
the same pattern, with most frequent hospitalizations by
MHþSA patients, followed by SA, MH, and non-MH/SA.
For MH, most hospitalizations were not related to MH (20%
related to MH). However, 50% of hospitalizations of SA
patients were related to SA, and 69% of MHþSA were
related to MH/SA.
Table 2 shows the regression results comparing MH/SA
groups to non-MH/SA patients for 2011-2012 adjusting for
Table 1. Sex, Age, and Health Care Costs for Patients Identified as Having Mental Health Problems Only (MH), Substance Use/Addiction

 sex and age (results were similar for other years; not shown).
Analyses indicated that all MH/SA groups were significantly
different from the non-MH/SA group at the P < 0.001 level
for all comparisons. Consistent with results shown in the
figures, overall rate and odds ratios controlling for sex and
age were highest for MHþSA patients, followed by SA and
MH across all 3 types of service use. For example, compared
to non-MH/SA patients, MHþSA patients visited a primary
care physician more than 5 times as often, were almost
6 times as likely to use the ED, and almost 8 times as likely
to be hospitalized.
For analyses restricted to non-MH/SA visits, all rate and
odds ratios were attenuated but remained significant, with
more frequent visits/hospitalizations for MH, SA, and

 MHþSA patients (P < 0.001) than for non-MH/SA patients
in all models. However, attenuation was more pronounced
for primary care physician visits and hospitalizations than
for ED visits, especially for the SA and MHþSA groups. For
example, the rate ratio for MHþSA (compared to non-MH/
SA) was reduced from 5.59 for all primary care physician
visits to 1.56 when analyses were restricted to non-MH/SA
visits, whereas the odds ratio for ED visits decreased from
5.94 to 3.45.
Discussion
Analyses of health care records of primary care visits, ED
visits, and hospitalizations from a large representative sam-
ple provide several new insights into use of general medical
services by patients with MH/SA problems. First, the present
findings provide clear evidence that individuals with MH/SA
problems are more frequent users of all types of medical
services. Per capita use was highest for patients with
MHþSA problems, followed by SA only and MH only, and
lowest for those without MH/SA problems. Second, costs
associated with service use were higher for those with
co-occurring MHþSA problems compared to SA-only and
MH-only groups. This confirms other evidence that patients
with MHþSA problems have more complex needs and are
high users of health services.16-21,35 Thus, it is critical that
professionals providing general medical services have train-
ing and capacity to ensure adequate care for persons with
MH/SA problems, especially given findings by Wang et al.36
that persons with serious mental illness who were treated
only in the general medical sector were less likely to receive
minimally adequate care compared to those receiving spe-
cialist care.
Only a small proportion of cases were identified as SA—
less than 2% of the sample (including both SA and MHþSA
cases); yet, according to 2013 survey data, 13.7% of Ontario
adults reported hazardous or harmful drinking, and 6.6%
reported symptoms of alcohol dependence in the past year37
(using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test
[AUDIT38]). Thus, it is likely that not all patients who actu-
ally had SA problems were identified. Underidentification
may have been due to SA problems being generally under-
identified by medical staff.39 As well, even when the role of
SA is identified, it may not be recorded in medical records
(e.g., emergency treatment for an injury that is alcohol
related). Also, stigma associated with SA may cause people
with SA problems to avoid doctors40 or not reveal alcohol
problems to medical professionals. Of note, the MHþSA
group was larger than the SA-only group. This may reflect
the high rate of co-occurring MH problems among persons
with SA problems,12-14 greater likelihood of identification
because of more frequent contact with the system, or greater
opportunity for SA problems to be identified when MH prob-
lems are treated.
The high number of primary care visits by persons with
MH/SA problems confirms that family doctors play a major
role in care for persons with MH problems.41-43 North Amer-
ican studies suggest that this role has been increasing,43,44
with 1 study in Manitoba43 finding that 24% of services
provided by family doctors were for psychosocial condi-
tions. We cannot know from the present data the extent that
patients see family doctors instead of or in addition to using
mental health and substance use specialty services. How-
ever, given the relatively high use of primary care services
and related costs for MH/SA problems, it is crucially impor-
tant that primary care physicians know not only how to
address MH24 and SA problems39 but also how to link
patients with other specialized services,45 including psychia-
trists46 and MH/SA specialty services in the community.2,47
It is also important to explore and evaluate efforts to coordi-
nate care between primary care physicians and other MH/SA
services through collaborations and partnerships.48-53
The high use of ED services by people with MH/SA
problems, especially those with co-occurring MHþSA
problems, suggests that it is important for future research
to ascertain the extent that such use reflects unavoidable
need for emergency services versus system factors such as
insufficient local specialist services for MH/SA,54 includ-
ing a lack of 24-hour access to MH and SA counselling55;
poor access to psychiatrists and other counselling services
to manage MH problems before they reach a crisis46,56,57;
poor health-related attitudes and values58; low use of pre-
ventive health services by some heavy drinkers59; or pov-
erty and other social determinants that may lead to use of
emergency services in the absence of access to more suit-
able services.25,60-62
Patients with MH/SA problems also made more visits for
non-MH/SA reasons (physical health) compared to non-MH/
SA cases, and this was especially true for ED visits. This
finding is consistent with evidence that people with MH/SA
problems tend to experience more health problems generally
and more intentional and unintentional injuries than do peo-
ple with no MH/SA problems1,9,23,24,26 Most notably, two-
thirds of ED visits by patients with MHþSA problems were
recorded as non-MH/SA related. The high rate of non-MH/
SA emergency department visits may be reflective of the
high prevalence of medical comorbidity in this patient pop-
ulation1,23,24; however, it is also possible that the links
between MH/SA and illness/injury are sometimes missed
or not recorded by attending physicians.63 Further investiga-
tion is needed to assess the extent that MH/SA problems are
recognized64 and treated effectively65 at EDs.
Strengths and Limitations
Strengths of the present analyses include a broad approach to
identifying users of the system based on a large general
population sample of patients who used physician/hospital
services across the province as opposed to data from a single
health care provider as in most previous studies; examination
of a broad range of services, including primary care, hospi-
talizations, and ED, as well as total costs; comparison of
La Revue Canadienne de Psychiatrie 62(1)
53
 patients classified into 4 groups using standard criteria (MH
only, SA only, MHþSA, and non-MH/SA); and assessment
of service use for both MH/SA versus non-MH/SA reasons.
A limitation of the study is that administrative data may
include diagnoses that are incomplete or inconsistently
reported. As well, MH/SA problems may be underidentified
in general medical settings given that many people with MH/
SA problems do not receive treatment for these problems.66
Also, we have no information about the rate of MH/SA
problems among those who were excluded because they did
not use any general medical services during the study period.
As discussed above, underidentification may be especially
true for SA problems. Specifically, the Steele et al.32 algo-
rithm that we used has been validated for identifying MH
cases generally (with SA codes subsumed under MH); how-
ever, no separate validation was done for SA codes. In addi-
tion, while the relatively large proportion of MH cases (over
18%) suggests that a broad range of MH problems (from
minor to severe) were included in the sample, it is possible
that SA cases included only those with severe SA problems.
Thus, comparisons of rates of service use for MH versus SA
should be interpreted with caution. Despite possible under-
identification of SA, separating SA only from co-occurring
MHþSA patients provides important new knowledge absent
from previous studies that compared MHþSA to MH only
but not to SA only.
Finally, although the findings are consistent with evi-
dence from the United States and elsewhere, another limita-
tion of this study is that data are from a single Canadian
province with a publicly funded health care system and may
not be fully generalizable to other types of health systems.
Conclusion
It is clear that primary care physicians and other medical/
hospital workers play a major role in assisting persons who
have mental health and substance use/addiction problems.
As such, MH/SA is not a specialty health issue but rather a
core health issue that affects all health service environ-
ments.1 Therefore, it is critical that health professionals in
these environments have core competencies59 relating to
MH and SA identification, prevention, and treatment, as well
as an understanding of interrelationships and interactions of
physical health with MH/SA to ensure that persons with MH/
SA problems receive appropriate and comparable quality of
care to those who do not have these problems.1,67,68 Also
needed in these settings is sound knowledge of the larger
network of services to make appropriate referrals and lin-
kages with other nonmedical and medical specialist service
providers. Improved knowledge and system-wide communi-
cation and coordination between general medical45 and spe-
cialist services55,69 would improve integration of services for
people who have complex needs relating to MH or SA, espe-
cially co-occurring MH and SA disorders,70,71 and thus may
reduce system inefficiencies and the overall burden on the
health system.
