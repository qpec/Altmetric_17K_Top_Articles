Background: Measles vaccine (MV) administered as the last vaccine after the third 
dose of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) may be associated with better child sur-
vival unrelated to prevention of measles infection. Other studies have shown that MV 
administered after DTP was more beneficial and was associated with lower mortality 
compared with DTP administered after MV or DTP administered simultaneously with 
MV. We compared the difference in mortality between measles vaccinated after DTP3 
and measles-unvaccinated children in Navrongo, Ghana.
Methods: This was a follow-up study involving annual cohort of children aged 
9–23 months from 1996 to 2012. We assessed survival in relation to the measles vacci-
nation status within the first 12 months from interview date and until 5 years of age using 
Cox proportional hazards models.
results: In all, 38,333 children were included in the study. The proportion of children 
vaccinated with MV-after-DTP3 increased from 45% in 1996 to 95% in 2012. The 
adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for measles unvaccinated compared with MV-after-DTP3 
vaccinated children was 1.38 (1.15–1.66) in the first 12 months after assessment of 
vaccination status and 1.22 (1.05–1.41) with follow-up to 5 years of age. The national 
immunization days campaigns with oral polio vaccine or MV might have reduced the 
effect of being MV-after-DTP3 vaccinated vs MV-unvaccinated. For 12 months of 
 
follow-up, the HR before a campaign for MV-unvaccinated children was 1.63 (1.23–2.17) 
compared to those who received MV-after-DTP3. After the campaign, the HR reduced 
to 1.23 (0.97–1.54). Stratifying the analysis by sex, measles-unvaccinated boys had a 
HR of 1.69 (1.33–2.61) compared to measles-unvaccinated girls who had a HR 1.06 
(0.79–1.40) during 1-year follow-up. In 1989, only 7% of children in the area had received 
MV-after-DTP3; the increase in MV-after-DTP3 coverage from 1989 to 2012 may have 
lowered mortality rate among children aged 9 months to 3 years by 24%.

conclusion: Though an observational study, our findings suggest that measles vac-
cination, administered in the recommended sequence, is associated with improved 
child survival and may have contributed importantly to the mortality decline toward the 
achievement of Millennium Development Goal 4.

The introduction of the WHO’s Expanded Programme on 
Immunization (EPI) through a combination of routine and mass 
immunization programs against the six childhood killer diseases 
(tuberculosis, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, and 
measles) has contributed greatly toward reducing childhood 
mortality and morbidity (1). Much of the decline in childhood 
mortality in developing countries can be attributed to the impact 
of immunizations (2, 3).
The current vaccination schedule in Ghana requires each 
child to receive one dose of Bacille Calmette–Guerin (BCG) at 
birth, four doses of oral polio vaccine (OPV) (at birth, 6, 10, and 
14 weeks), three doses of pentavalent (Penta) vaccine (at 6, 10, 
and 14 weeks), two doses of rotavirus at (6 and 10 weeks), three 
doses of pneumococcal vaccines (at 6, 10, and 14 weeks), two 
doses of measles (at 9 and 18 months), and one dose of yellow 
fever (at 9 months). Penta vaccine (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, 
Haemophilus influenzae type b, and hepatitis B) was introduced in 
January 2002 to replace diphtheria–tetanus–pertussis (DTP), and 
in May 2012, three additional vaccines; pneumococcal, rotavirus, 
and second dose measles vaccine (MV) at 18 months were added 
to the vaccination schedule.
Evaluations of immunization programs are usually based on 
the assumption that vaccines have an impact only against the 
specific disease. Each vaccine is assessed based on its ability to 
prevent the occurrence of a particular disease or prevent children 
from dying from that disease (4). The estimated effect of these 
vaccines on childhood mortality may be underestimated, par-
ticularly for MV (2, 3, 5–13). When MV was introduced in Africa 
in the late 1970s and early 1980s, several studies found major 
reductions in childhood mortality (14, 15). Population based 
studies in Asia and the Americas reported similar results. The 
30–86% reduction on childhood mortality from MV reported 
in these studies was much larger than anticipated, as measles 
infection accounted for less than 30% of the deaths in these com-
munities (3). The reductions found in childhood mortality are in 
addition to those associated with measles infection. Hence, these 
observations suggest that MV may have non-specific beneficial 
effects (NSEs) that provide protection against infections other 
than measles (3).
The NSEs of vaccines might be explained by cross reactive 
 
T- and B-cell epitopes (heterologous immunity) or trained innate 
immunity or both (16–18). Recent studies of BCG indicate that 
the NSEs may be due to epigenetic changes reprogramming innate 
immunity (“immune training”) to a stronger pro-inflammatory 
response also to unrelated pathogens and may change once the 
child gets vaccinated with a new vaccine (19, 20).
The WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immu-
nization (SAGE) recently conducted a thorough review of 
the potential NSEs of vaccines and concluded in the epide-
miological review that MV may be associated with beneficial 
non-specific effects (6). In the immunological review, SAGE 
concluded that the findings neither excluded nor confirmed 
the possibility of beneficial or deleterious non-specific immu-
nological effects of the vaccines under study (BCG, DTP, MV) 
on all-cause mortality (21).
The WHO and other international organizations have been 
advocating for improved vaccination coverage levels. Coverage 
for measles vaccination in Ghana by the end of 2014 was 89% 
(22). What is often not emphasized is the timeliness of adminis-
tering the vaccines and the strict adherence to the recommended 
sequence of vaccinations. Previous studies in Africa and Asia 
have suggested that administering DTP simultaneously with MV 
or DTP after MV may be associated with higher mortality than 
having MV as the most recent vaccination (7–11, 13, 23).
We have previously analyzed the effect of getting MV- 
after-DTP3 compared with getting DTP with or after MV, i.e., 
MV-out-of-sequence, which showed that receiving DTP with 
MV or DTP after MV was associated with 42% higher mortality 
than having MV as the most recent vaccination, i.e., MV-after-
DTP3 (13). Hence, this study showed how much has been gained 
in child survival by increasingly following the recommended 
schedule. In this study, we have focused on examining the dif-
ference in mortality between having received MV-after-DTP3 
and being MV-unvaccinated. We, further, assessed whether the 
effect differed between males and females and whether the effect 
was affected by mass vaccination campaigns with OPV or MV. 
Finally, we examined to what extent increasing the proportion 
of children receiving MV-after-DTP3 might have contributed 
to the decline in child mortality toward the achievement of 
Millennium Development Goal 4.

study setting
The study area is the Kassena-Nankana East and West Districts 
in the Upper East region of northern Ghana (24, 25). The esti-
mated population is 160,000 under continuous demographic 
surveillance with about 8% (4,000) of the current population 
aged 9–23 months. It covers a land area of 1,675 km2. It has a 
hospital that serves as a referral hospital to seven health centers, 
a private clinic and over 40 Community Health Compounds 
located in rural communities and manned by trained nurses who 
provide basic health care as well as routine vaccinations. The

area is mostly rural (80%) with primary occupation being sub-
sistence agriculture. During the period of the study, under-five 
mortality declined from 235/1,000 in 1996 to 51.5/1,000 deaths 
in 2012 (Figure S1 in Supplementary Material). The estimated 
population of resident children aged 9 to 23 months in the study 
area during the period of the study from 1996 to 2012 was about 
60,000.
Vaccination Data
Routine vaccination data from the Navrongo Health and 
Demographic Surveillance system (HDSS) were used for this 
study. From 1996 to 2010, vaccination data were collected once 
annually from October to December by fieldworkers from health 
cards of children less than 2 years of age, except in 2001 when 
the HDSS failed to collect vaccination data (13). From 2011 to 
2012, vaccination data were collected every 4 months for children 
below 3 years of age.
The HDSS field teams visit all households three to four times 
a year to document demographic events, educational status, 
and household possession. The demographic events routinely 
collected include births, deaths, pregnancies, marriages, and 
migrations. All residents in the surveillance area are assigned a 
unique ID, and all demographic events, including the records of 
the dead, are linked using each individual’s unique ID. The HDSS 
is a monitoring tool for assessing the impact of health interven-
tions (24, 26).
Before the Navrongo HDSS was established, vaccination data 
were also collected from health cards in 1989–1991 during a 
vitamin A trial for children aged 6 months to 5 years (26, 27). 
 
In this trial, the children were followed every 4 months for a 
period of 2 years to distribute vitamin A supplements and to 
ascertain survival.
ethics approval
This study was carried out in accordance with the recommenda-
tions of the Institutional Review Board of the Navrongo Health 
Research Centre. The study area has a HDSS that is used to 
monitor the population dynamics of the communities. Being 
a HDSS site that required routine frequent visits (about three 
to four times in a year) to households to update health and 
demographic events such as births, deaths, in-migrants and out-
migrants, we sought verbal consent from heads of households 
for the routine collection of the demographic events. We also 
collected and updated routine vaccination data of children below 
3 years during the three to four visits in a year to households. For 
the vaccination data collection, we sought verbal consent from 
the mother or father or, in the absence of the parents, any adult 
caregiver to document the routine vaccines the child has received 
from the health card. The consent process was approved by the 
institutional review board of the Navrongo Health Research 
Centre.
statistical Methods
Data were entered into a database system developed in Visual 
FoxPro 6.0 and analyzed using STATA 12.1. The vaccination 
records of each child were linked to their death records from the 
HDSS database using their unique IDs to ascertain their survival 
status. The analysis was limited to children aged 9–23 months 
at the time of assessment of vaccination status as this is the age 
group relevant for MV; the children were only included the first 
time if their vaccination card was seen more than once in this 
age group. The MV-vaccinated children were those who received 
MV after the last DTP dose (DTP3). The MV-unvaccinated 
children included those who did not receive any vaccine at all, 
or received other vaccines including DTP but not MV. Survival 
analysis using Cox proportional hazards models with age as the 
underlying time and reported as mortality rate ratios (MRRs) 
with 95% confidence interval were used to assess the association 
between measles vaccinations status at enrollment and subse-
quent mortality. The proportional hazards assumption for the 
Cox proportional hazard models were examined (Figure S2 in 
Supplementary Material). We also adjusted for socioeconomic 
status (wealth index), sex, maternal education, and interview 
year. A wealth index was computed from household assets using 
principal component analysis. Mortality was assessed prospec-
tively from the interview date using the landmark approach to 
reduce survival bias for 12 months of follow-up and then till they 
attained age 5 years. Follow-up was censored on 30th April 2012 
because two vaccines, rotavirus and pneumococcal vaccines, and 
an additional MV at 18 months were introduced in May 2012 
into Ghana’s immunization program. Analysis was stratified by 
the periods DTP (1996–2001) and Penta (2002–2012) were used 
and by sex. In analyzing the data collected during the vitamin A 
trial in 1989–1990, we adjusted for age, ownership of radio, zone, 
and weight for age.
The specific effects of vaccines in providing immunity against 
targeted infections are likely to be maintained over several years. 
However, the non-specific effects may be due to epigenetic 
changes reprogramming innate immunity and may change once 
the child gets a new vaccination (28, 29). It is, therefore, likely 
the national immunization days (NID) campaigns with OPV or 
MV could have changed the vaccination status because these 
vaccines are likely to become the most recent vaccination for 
the children after the campaign. We examined this possibility 
by calculating the mortality rates and hazard ratios (HR) before 
and after the campaign. This was treated as an intention-to-treat 
analysis assuming that all children got the campaign vaccine. 
The analysis included all deaths including the very few deaths 
from measles. National coverage data suggest that participation 
was very high and individual level coverage data from the study 
area from 2011 to 2012 indicate that campaigns reached at least 
86–94% of the eligible population (13).
A Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) 
was tested in Navrongo in the period 1994–2003 where trained 
nurses were relocated into communities to provide basic health 
care and routine vaccinations services. During the experiment, 
the study area was divided into four experimental cells. Cell1 had 
community health volunteers (CHVs) only, Cell2 had trained 
community health nurses called community health officers 
(CHOs) only, Cell3 had both CHOs and CHVs, and Cell4 was 
the comparison cell with no interventions. We examined how 
improved routine vaccination services in the villages with nurses 
affected measles after DTP3 vaccination coverage during the trial 
period.

We also censored for measles deaths in some of our analyses 
to assess to what extent the changes in mortality were due 
to the prevention of measles infection. Measles deaths were 
identified using verbal autopsy procedures. We interviewed 
the mother or guardian using verbal autopsy tools to ascertain 
the circumstances leading to the death of the child. The VA 
instruments contain a set of questions as well as a section for 
verbatim narrations of the circumstances leading to the death. 
Three physicians each reviewed the verbal autopsy forms and 
assigned an underlying cause of death. If at least two agreed 
on the underlying cause of death to be measles, a diagnosis 
was established.
resUlTs
In all, 38,333 children aged 9–23 months and enrolled between 
1996 and 2012 were included in the analysis. About 50.5% 
(19,354) were males. The proportion of children vaccinated with 
MV-after-DTP3 increased from 44.5% (1,169/2,627) in 1996 to 
95.5% (3,813/3,994) in 2011. Overall, measles vaccination cover-
age increased from 60.6 (1,591/2,627) to 96.7% (3,863/3,994) 
in the same period. In 1989–1990, about 40% of children aged 
9–23 months were vaccinated against measles, and just 6.6% were 
vaccinated with measles after DTP3 (Figure 1). Table 1 compares 
the background characteristics of children included in the study, 
i.e., the MV-after-DTP3 and no-MV groups. The distribution 
of the children by sex, mother’s education, wealth index, age at 
enrollment, and interview year vary slightly within the MV-after-
DTP3 and no-MV groups (Table 1).
Mortality during Follow-up
Children not vaccinated with MV at enrollment had 38% higher 
risk of dying than those vaccinated with MV-after-DTP3 dur-
ing 12 months of follow-up [HR = 1.38 (1.15–1.66)] (Table 2). 
When mortality was assessed from interview date until 5 years 
of age, measles-unvaccinated children had 22% higher risk of 
dying than children vaccinated with MV-after-DTP3 [HR = 1.22 
(1.05–1.41)]. The size of the beneficial effect of MV did not change 
when we censored for measles deaths (Table S1 in Supplementary 
Material).
Stratifying the analysis by periods in which DTP and Penta 
were used, children without MV in the DTP period (1996–2001) 
had 30% higher risk of dying in the first 12 months of follow-up 
[HR = 1.30 (1.04–1.62)] than those who received MV-after-DTP3. 
In the Penta period (2002–2012), children without MV had 52% 
higher risk of dying during 12 months of follow-up than those 
who received MV after Penta3 [HR = 1.52 (1.12–2.05)] (Table 2). 
The risk associated with not receiving MV did not change when 
we censored for measles deaths (Table S1 in Supplementary 
Material). When the children were followed from the assessment 
date until they were 5 years old, children without MV during 
the DTP period had 10% higher risk of dying than those with 
MV after DTP3 [HR = 1.10 (0.92–1.32)]. In the Penta period, 
children without MV had 44% higher risk of dying than those 
who received MV after Penta3 [HR = 1.44 (1.13–1.84)] when they 
were followed from the assessment date until they were 5 years 
old. The risk of dying for MV-unvaccinated children was higher 
during the Penta period compared to the DTP period in the first 
12 months after assessment of vaccination status (52 vs 30%) 
(P = 0.021), and with follow-up to 5 years of age (44 vs 10%) 
(P = 0.005).
We, further, classified the MV-unvaccinated children into 
two groups; children who received other vaccines but not MV, 
and those who did not receive any vaccine (unvaccinated). The 
adjusted HR for those who received other vaccines except MV 
compared with MV-after-DTP3 vaccinated children was 1.42 
(1.18–1.72) in the first 12 months after assessment of vaccina-
tion status and 1.24 (1.06–1.44) with follow-up to 5 years of age

5 years of age (Table 3). For girls, the HR = 1.06 (0.79–1.40) dur-
ing 1 year of follow-up, and 0.98 (0.78–1.24) when followed until 
5 years of age. The effect differed significantly for boys and girls 
(P = 0.001; test of homogeneity).
Measles Vaccination status  
and subsequent Mortality before  
and after OPV or Measles campaigns
To examine whether national OPV or measles campaigns affected 
the estimated effect of receiving MV-after-DTP3 on subsequent 
mortality, we calculated the mortality rates and HR before and 
after any campaign during follow-up. For 12 months of follow-
up, the HR before a campaign for MV-unvaccinated children 
was 1.63 (1.23–2.17) compared to those who received MV-after-
DTP3. After the campaign, the HR reduced to 1.23 (0.97–1.54) 
(Table 4). If we limited the analysis to MV campaigns, the HR 
before a campaign was 1.41 (1.17–1.70) for MV-unvaccinated 
children but reduced to 0.92 (0.40–2.09) after the campaign. 
Similar mortality patterns were observed before and after cam-
paigns during the DTP and Penta periods, and among females 
(Table 4). The campaigns may have reduced the effect of being 
MV-after-DTP3 vaccinated vs MV-unvaccinated.
chPs impact on Measles Vaccination 
coverage
The proportion of MV-after-DTP3 vaccinated children was higher 
in the villages with CHOs [RR = 1.29 (1.23–1.35)] than the areas 
with no intervention (Cell4) (Table 5). In the non-intervention 
area, measles-unvaccinated children had 78% higher mortality 
[HR = 1.78 (1.25–2.52)] than those vaccinated. Similarly, measles-
unvaccinated children had 38% higher mortality in the interven-
tion cells than those who received MV [HR = 1.38 (0.99–1.94)] 
(Table 5). The data we used to compare the effect of MV in areas 
with community nurses and control areas with no intervention 
was limited to the period of the intervention from 1996 to 2003. 
Even though the relative risk of dying for MV-unvaccinated 
children was higher in the non-intervention communities than 
the communities with nurses (78 vs 38%), this difference was not 
statistically significant (P = 0.557). The reduced risk of dying for 
MV-unvaccinated children in the intervention areas compared 
with those in the non-intervention areas could be a result of the 
intensive child centered activities of the nurses and other health 
care volunteers in the intervention areas during the period of 
the intervention. These estimates are probably conservative 
because many children got MV during follow-up, with a higher 
proportion of children in the intervention cells (72%) receiving 
MV compared to those in the non-intervention cells (52%). The 
intervention with CHOs improved child survival and became a 
national health delivery policy in Ghana (24, 25).
DiscUssiOn
Main Observations
In this study, we found a significant reduction in mortality of 38% 
during 1 year of follow-up after assessment of vaccination status 
and 22% with follow-up to 5 years of age for MV-after-DTP3 
(Table S2 in Supplementary Material). For the unvaccinated, the 
adjusted HR compared with MV-after-DTP3 vaccinated children 
was 1.14 (0.75–1.73) in the first 12 months after assessment of 
vaccination status and 1.10 (0.78–1.56) with follow-up to 5 years 
of age (Table S2 in Supplementary Material).
Measles Vaccination status at enrollment 
and subsequent Mortality by sex
We assessed the effects of being MV-after-DTP3 vaccinated on 
subsequent mortality separately for males and females. Being

vaccinated children compared to measles-unvaccinated chil-
dren. We observed similar beneficial patterns of receiving 
MV-after-DTP3 when we stratified the analysis by males and 
females (Table 3). The protective effect of MV-after-DTP3 
vaccination on mortality was unchanged when we censored 
for measles deaths in our analysis. The reduction in mortality 
was particularly strong during the penta period from 2002 to 
2012. Even though childhood mortality declined during the 
Penta period, the beneficial effect of MV did not change. It even 
appeared to be more beneficial at the Penta period when a lot 
more antigens were used compared to the DTP period. The 
mortality patterns before and after OPV or measles campaigns 
suggest that these campaigns may have reduced the effect of 
being MV-after-DTP3 vaccinated vs MV-unvaccinated. There 
have been major improvements in the coverage of MV-after-
DTP3 vaccination in the study area, and this is likely to have 
contributed importantly to the mortality reduction toward 
achieving Millennium Development Goal 4 (MDG4) (Figure S1 
in Supplementary Material).
strengths and Weaknesses
There are a number of weaknesses to this study. First, the 
children classified as MV-unvaccinated may have received MV 
during the follow-up period, particularly for those that were 
relatively young. About 59 and 67% of the MV-unvaccinated 
children contacted in subsequent visits in the first 12 months 
of follow-up and up to 5 years of age, respectively, had subse-
quently received MV. Only 7 and 13% of the MV-unvaccinated 
children were met in the first 12 months of follow-up and up 
to 5 years, respectively. Second, almost every year since 1996, 
there were national campaigns with either OPV or MV or both. 
These campaigns often occurred in October and November 
more or less at the same time that the annual survey of vaccina-
tion status was conducted and vaccination status assessed. Both 
of these weaknesses would tend to minimize the difference in 
mortality between MV-after-DTP3 and MV-unvaccinated and 
may explain why the estimates declined when the children were 
followed to 5 years of age. In other words, our estimates are 
conservative.
Being an observational study, there are likely other confound-
ing factors that this study could not control for directly, such as 
general improvement in the health-care delivery system, health 
literacy as well as infrastructure, which could have affected the 
mortality rates and also increased MV coverage. One could 
also argue that the comparison group of no MV may represent 
the population with no access or difficult access to vaccines or 
health care, hence have higher mortality in general. However, 
differential access to health-care services is unlikely to explain 
all the excess mortality associated with MV-unvaccinated, 
as mortality was still much higher among MV-unvaccinated 
children compared with MV-after-DTP3 in both communities 
with nurses and control communities without nurses (Table 5). 
Furthermore, after general MV campaigns, the difference 
between the two groups disappeared making it unlikely that the 
difference in mortality is primarily due to inherent weaknesses 
or frailty.
This study also has several important methodological strengths. 
This study used so far the largest data set on routine vaccination 
from a low/middle-income country (13). It also made use of  well-
documented longitudinal data collected by the Navrongo HDSS 
which enabled us to track and monitor the survival status of the 
children and to control for important potential confounders and 
major determinants of child mortality in the study area.
The coverage for MV-after-DTP3 increased from 7% in 
1989 to 95% in 2012. This change in MV-after-DTP3 coverage 
might have contributed importantly to the reduction in child 
mortality and the achievement of MDG4 in the study area. 
The improvement in MV-after-DTP3 vaccination coverage 
is related to a strong emphasis on routine services and can 
partly be attributed to improved health care delivery in the 
area, particularly with the introduction of the CHPS in which 
trained community health nurses are relocated into communi-
ties to provide basic health care as well as routine vaccinations. 
The community-based intervention trial took place in the 
study area and later led to the current Ghanaian policy on 
community-based health service delivery (24). As indicated in 
Table 5, this program increased the MV-after-DTP3 coverage 
considerably.

consistency and contradiction  
with Previous Observations
Our results point to a beneficial effect of MV on child survival. 
The 38% higher mortality for MV-unvaccinated children would 
correspond to 28% lower mortality for MV-vaccinated children. 
Considering that this estimate is probably conservative, this is 
consistent with other studies from developing countries which 
have reported mortality reductions in the range of 30–86% 
 
(3, 6). Other studies comparing mortality rates before and after 
the introduction of MV reported major reductions in mortality 
after the introduction of MV (3, 28–31). The data from the present 
study also supported that MV may have non-specific beneficial 
effects which go beyond protecting children from dying from 
measles infection.
Measles vaccination was associated with beneficial effect 
for both boys and girls before receiving any campaign vaccine 
(Table 4). However, after the campaigns, we found a signifi-
cantly stronger beneficial effect of measles vaccination for boys, 
but not for girls. It is unclear why the beneficial effect is stronger 
for boys as many other studies reported stronger beneficial 
effects of measles vaccination for girls than boys. For example 
the SAGE review suggested that MV had a 40% (22–53%) 
stronger effect for girls than boys (6). However, some studies 
have suggested that OPV is associated with stronger beneficial 
effects for boys than for girls (32, 33). Hence, we recommend 
that future studies examine the sex-differential effect of measles 
vaccination on all-cause mortality before and after OPV or 
measles campaigns.
interpretation
Generally, vaccines are assessed based on the immunogenicity of 
the vaccine or the ability of the vaccine to protect children from 
being infected or dying from the specific disease. However, the 
effect of MV in the present study was not explained by preven-
tion of measles infection since the estimates changed little when 
measles deaths were censored in the survival analyzes. There 
are several reasons why our finding of higher mortality among 
MV-unvaccinated children is unlikely to be due to confounding 
or differential access to health care between MV-vaccinated and 
MV-unvaccinated children. First, we controlled for potential 
confounding factors such as age, sex, maternal education, inter-
view year, and socioeconomic status, which may be associated 
with mortality and receiving MV. Second, differential access 
to care seems unlikely to explain a large part of the enigma 
since we showed similar tendencies for MV-unvaccinated vs 
MV-after-DTP3 in villages with and without nurses. The dif-
ferential effect of MV was somewhat less in the villages with 
community nurses but unvaccinated children in these villages 
were also much more likely to be vaccinated with MV during 
follow-up; hence, the estimate is likely to be more conservative 
in villages with community nurses than in control villages. 
Third, if the higher mortality of MV-unvaccinated children 
was mainly due to inherent weaknesses among the unvac-
cinated children, then as more and more of the unvaccinated 
received MV, the difference between the groups should have 
disappeared. This did not happen. Fourth, if inherent weakness 
or frailty were the main reason for the difference in mortality 
between the MV-unvaccinated and the MV-after-DTP3 groups, 
then the HR (MV-unvaccinated/MV-after-DTP3) should have 
been the same before and after other vaccination campaigns. 
That was not the case; instead, as predicted, the difference 
declined after all children were likely to have received a live 
vaccine (OPV, MV) as their last vaccination. Importantly, after 
general MV campaigns, the mortality difference disappeared 
completely. It seems more logical to assume that the MV-after-
DTP3 group had an immunological benefit compared with the 
MV-unvaccinated and not that the MV-unvaccinated group 
had high mortality due to inherent weaknesses or frailty. Fifth, 
since the HR for MV-after-DTP3 was stronger when compared 
with children who received other vaccines but not MV than 
with totally unvaccinated children, the beneficial effect of 
MV-after-DTP3 is likely to be due to MV and not because of 
other vaccines received in the routine vaccination programme. 
Sixth, randomized trials of MV have shown that MV as the 
most recent vaccine is associated with lower mortality which 
is not explained by prevention of measles infections (5, 34). 
It is, therefore, biologically plausible that MV-after-DTP3 
may induce an immunological benefit compared with being 
MV-unvaccinated.
Previous studies have suggested that OPV might have ben-
eficial NSEs (32, 35, 36). Findings from a randomized trial sug-
gested that OPV might have beneficial non-specific effects that 
reduced all-cause mortality by 17% (30). Though the underlying 
biological mechanisms have not been fully studied, some studies 
suggest that OPV, just like BCG, is capable of inducing strong 
immune training (36). In this study, the NID campaigns with 
OPV or MV might have reduced the effect of being MV-after-
DTP3 vaccinated vs MV-unvaccinated.
As has been shown for BCG, beneficial NSEs may be due to 
epigenetic changes reprogramming innate immunity. This may 
change once the child gets a new vaccination (19, 20). The specific 
immunological mechanisms behind the non-specific effects of 
vaccine are still being investigated, and it might be a mixture 
of heterologous immunity, trained innate immunity, and other 
types of changes in the immune system (16, 19).
It has recently been suggested that measles infection leads 
to immunosuppression which leads to excess non-measles 
mortality over the next 2–3 years and that the introduction 
of MV prevents this immune amnesia and, therefore, led 
to a more general reduction in non-measles mortality (37). 
However, this hypothesis was not supported by individual 
level data showing higher long-term mortality after measles 
infection. The studies which have examined long-term 
mortality have tended to find lower subsequent mortality if 
the individual survived the acute phase of measles infection 
 
(38, 39). Hence, it may not be the prevention of immune amne-
sia which explains the beneficial effect of MV. In Navrongo, 
there was very little measles for the last 10 years of the study 
period (Table 2), but having MV-after-DTP still had a major 
beneficial effect on child survival.
In a recent SAGE review, the studies of BCG and MV suggested 
almost a halving of mortality which could not be explained by the 
prevention of the targeted diseases (6). However, the non-specific 
 9

effects of vaccines on overall mortality are yet to be considered 
in vaccine policy formulation. This study shows that MV-after-
DTP3 vaccination is associated with considerable non-specific 
beneficial effect on child survival.
Measles Vaccinations contribution  
to the Decline in child Mortality
Considering that children not vaccinated with MV are 
associated with 38% higher risk of dying than those who 
received MV-after-DTP3 during 1-year follow-up (Table 2), 
the increase in the proportion of children vaccinated with 
MV-after-DTP3 from 53 to 96.4% between 1996 and 2012 
(Table S3 in Supplementary Material) would have meant a 14% 
reduction in childhood mortality for children aged 9 months 
to 3 years. This would amount to about 813 children likely 
to be saved by measles vaccination from an estimated 3,387 
children aged 9–36 months that died between 1996 and 2012 
in the area.
Going back to the vaccination data collected during the 
vitamin A trial in Navrongo from 1989 and 1991 when 10% 
had received MV-after-DTP3 to the current level of 96.4% in 
2012 (Table S4 in Supplementary Material), the increase in 
coverage levels for MV-after-DTP3 vaccination would explain 
a 24% reduction in mortality for children aged 9 months to 
3 years assuming not-being-MV-vaccinated to be associated 
with a 38% higher mortality than MV-after-DTP3 (Table S4 
in Supplementary Material). The 24% reduction in mortal-
ity would translate into 1,285 children likely to be saved 
 
by measles vaccination from an estimated 5,352 children 
 
aged 9–36 months that died between 1990 and 2012 in the 
study area.
implications and conclusion
This study shows that MV-after-DTP3 is clearly associated with 
considerable reductions in mortality even after censoring for 
measles deaths in the analysis. This has several implications. 
Our findings suggest that increasing the MV-after-DTP3 
coverage has the potential to reduce child mortality in a major 
way. Considering the number of lives saved through measles 
vaccination, this might be a major contributor to achieving 
the MDG4 in the study area. In the current understanding of 
the decline in child mortality, MV is believed to have had a 
rather modest effect, particularly in the last decade. In Niger, 
for example, MV was only estimated to have produced 5% of 
the reduction in mortality between 1998 and 2009 (40). The 
process we have described for the last 25 years in Navrongo 
is likely to have occurred also in other low-income countries. 
Getting MV-after-DTP3 improves child survival irrespective of 
the timing of the measles vaccination. Some studies suggest that 
if MV is given early after DTP3, this may further reduce child 
mortality (12).
When Ghana launched its EPI in June 1978 with six anti-
gens; BCG, measles, DTP, and oral polio vaccines were often 
delivered in campaigns with irregular intervals to reach certain 
targets (41) rather than through routine vaccination services. 
Vaccines were, therefore, often delivered out of sequence. 
Getting the vaccination program to function in a regular fash-
ion may have had a much larger impact on child survival than 
usually assumed.
The WHO through EPI/SAGE should implement or encour-
age policies that would promote measles vaccination. The 
use of measles vaccination coverage as one of the monitoring 
targets may be needed to put stronger emphasis on measles 
vaccination. This would encourage vaccination program 
implementers to not only focus on DTP3 coverage, but also 
ensure that children get vaccinated with MV-after-DTP3 
because of its survival benefits. Some studies suggest that live 
vaccines may have beneficial effects while inactivated vac-
cines may be associated with negative effects on child survival 
 
(6, 42). We should consider pursuing a measles-vaccine-last 
policy by ensuring that MV is the most recent vaccination 
through childhood. It is important to test the effect of MV and 
other routine vaccines on all-cause mortality in randomized 
trials.
Measles infection may be eliminated in the near future, and 
measles vaccination may be de-emphasized. We should continue 
to vaccinate with MV because of its beneficial effect in improving 
child survival.
