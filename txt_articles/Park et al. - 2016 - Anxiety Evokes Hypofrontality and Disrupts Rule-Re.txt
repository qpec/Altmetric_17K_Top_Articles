PFC-dependent task that required flexible switches between rules in two distinct perceptual dimensions. Anxiety elicited a sustained
background “hypofrontality” in dmPFC and OFC by reducing the firing rate of spontaneously active neuronal subpopulations. During
task performance, the impact of anxiety was subtle, but, consistent with human data, behavior was selectively impaired when previously
correct conditions were presented as conflicting choices. This impairment was associated with reduced recruitment of dmPFC neurons
that selectively represented task rules at the time of action. OFC rule representation was not affected by anxiety. These data indicate that

Introduction
Anxiety can be an adaptive reaction to stressful or unpredictable
life events, but it produces adverse cognitive effects that impede
ongoing behavior and contribute to clinical manifestation of anx-
iety disorders (Bishop, 2007; Eysenck et al., 2007). Anxiety also is
one of the more debilitating symptoms of psychiatric disorders,
including post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive
disorder, mood disorders, schizophrenia, and autism (Owens et
al., 2005; Solomon et al., 2008; Lu
¨thi and Lu
¨scher, 2014; Ruglass
et al., 2014; Hamilton et al., 2015). In addictive disorders, for
example, comorbidity with anxiety, as well as the anxiety associ-
ated with drug withdrawal during abstinence, are major contrib-
uting factors to relapse (Lu
¨thi and Lu
¨scher, 2014; Ruglass et al.,
2014).
Human behavioral and imaging investigations have described
a complex impact of anxiety on prefrontal cortex (PFC)-related

Significance Statement
A debilitating aspect of anxiety is its impact on decision making and flexible control of behavior. These cognitive constructs
dependonproperfunctioningoftheprefrontalcortex(PFC).UnderstandinghowanxietyaffectsPFCencodingofcognitiveevents
is of great clinical and evolutionary significance. Using a clinically valid experimental model, we find that, under anxiety, decision
making may be skewed by salient and conflicting environmental stimuli at the expense of flexible top-down guided choices. We
also find that anxiety suppresses spontaneous activity of PFC neurons, and weakens encoding of task rules by dorsomedial PFC
neurons. These data provide a neuronal encoding scheme for how anxiety disengages PFC during decision making.

 cognitive functions, including deficits in flexible control of be-
havior (Shin et al., 2001; Bishop, 2007; Eysenck et al., 2007).
Multiple models have been proposed for proper coping or path-
ological response to anxiety (Ouimet et al., 2009; Robinson et al.,
2013; Adhikari, 2014) and stress (Hains and Arnsten, 2008; Arn-
sten, 2009). However, the impact of anxiety on spontaneous and
phasic activity of PFC neuronal ensembles during cognitive-
behavioral performance is largely unknown.
Animal electrophysiological studies of PFC neurons during
anxiety have focused primarily on fearful or avoidance behaviors
(Sotres-Bayon et al., 2004; Burgos-Robles et al., 2009; Adhikari et
al., 2010, 2011). Although these studies have informed us about
the representation of fear-related events, such as freezing behav-
ior, anxiety is not limited to a rapid neuronal or behavioral event
but often is an enduring state that is sustained for many minutes
to hours. More importantly, the negative impact of anxiety ex-
tends beyond an aversive feeling and influences ongoing goal-
directed behaviors that use cognitive and affective processing at
the service of cognitive flexibility.
We sought to determine the impact of a sustained anxiety state
on PFC neural processing of a behavior that involved cognitive
flexibility. The anxiety state was induced by a pharmacological
model with excellent clinical validity. Specifically, extensive liter-
ature indicates that inverse agonists of allosteric benzodiazepine
binding sites in GABAA receptors, such as FG7142, produce
anxiety-like physiological, neurochemical, and behavioral effects
in rodents (Evans and Lowry, 2007), primates (Ninan et al., 1982;
Murphy et al., 1996a, b), and humans (Dorow, 1987). We com-
bined this experimental model of anxiety with unit recording in
two subregions of the PFC with particular importance for cogni-
tive control and emotional regulation: the dorsomedial PFC
(dmPFC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) (Stefani and Moghad-
dam, 2005; Darrah et al., 2008; Floresco et al., 2008; Schoenbaum
et al., 2009; Durstewitz et al., 2010; Lee, 2013; Likhtik et al., 2014).
We assessed the impact of FG7142 on spontaneous activity of
dmPFC and OFC neurons while rats freely moved in their home
cage during wake cycle and while they engaged in a rewarded
extradimensional set-shifting task. The task, similar to other ro-
dent set-shifting tasks, required rats to guide their instrumental
behavior based on two rules involving distinct perceptual dimen-
sions, and switch between the rules. This particular task has
been well characterized (Darrah et al., 2008; Floresco et al.,
2008) and was selected for its feasibility for multiple extradi-
mensional shifts within each session with electrophysiological
recordings.
We found that the anxiogenic treatment induced sustained
suppression of the spontaneous activity of subpopulations of
dmPFC and OFC neurons. During task performance, this treat-
ment produced modality-specific behavioral impairment that
correlated with reduced recruitment of dmPFC, but not OFC,
neurons that encode conflict-related actions.
Materials and Methods
Subjects and surgical procedure
Male Sprague Dawley rats (�400 g, Harlan) were singly housed on a 12 h
light/dark cycle (lights on at 7:00 P.M.). All data were collected during the
dark cycle. Animals were not previously exposed to any drugs or behav-
ioral training. Microelectrode arrays were implanted in the dmPFC and
contralateral OFC or bilateral dmPFC (home cage; n � 11, set-shifting
task; n � 8 rats) of isoflurane-anesthetized rats, and secured with dental
cement for chronic recording. The following coordinates (Paxinos and
Watson, 1998) were used (relative to bregma): dmPFC (home cage) �
3.0 mm anterior, 0.7 mm lateral, 2.2 mm ventral from skull; dmPFC
(set-shifting task) � 3.0 mm anterior, 0.7 mm lateral, 4 mm ventral; and
OFC (home cage and set-shifting task) � 3.0 mm anterior, 3.3 mm
lateral, 4.5 mm ventral. Recording sessions began after 1 week of postop-
erative recovery. At the completion of all recordings, rats were anesthe-
tized with 400 mg/kg intraperitoneal chloral hydrate and perfused with
saline and 10% buffered formalin. Coronal slices of PFC were collected
from each brain and cresyl-violet stained. Placements of electrode arrays
were confirmed via light microscope. All procedures were in accordance
with the National Institutes of Health’s Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals and were approved by the University of Pittsburgh
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Home-cage recording
In a home cage recording experiment, single-unit activity was recorded
from a freely moving rat in a clear polycarbonate home cage with bed-
ding. After 30 min of baseline recording, each rat received an intraperi-
toneal injection of FG7142 (5 or 10 mg/kg in vehicle) or 1.0 ml/kg vehicle
(one drop Tween 80 in 10 ml distilled water). Neuronal activity was
recorded for 120 min after injection. The order of injections was
randomized across rats with at least 3 d of washout period between
injections.
Set-shifting task
In a set-shifting experiment, a rat received an intraperitoneal injection of
vehicle, 5 or 10 mg/kg FG7142. Ten minutes were allowed after the in-
jection before placing the rat in the operant chamber. After a 3 min
habituation period in the chamber, the task was initiated. The order of
injection was randomized for each rat with at least 3 d of washout period
before the next injection.
Training and testing of the set-shifting task
Rats were placed on a restricted diet of 13 g of food/rat/d with free access
to water to maintain �85% of their free-feeding weight. Rats were
trained on an extradimensional set-shifting task that requires instrumen-
tal action according to two discrimination rules, each involving a distinct
perceptual dimension, spatial position, and a light cue (see Fig. 2a). For
training parameters and detailed characterization of this task, see Darrah
et al. (2008). Both perceptual dimensions in this task involve a light cue
presented at one of the two cue ports. Performance according to the
“Light” discrimination rule (light rule) requires a nose poke to the illu-
minated cue port, regardless of its spatial location for a reward pellet (see
Fig. 2a). Performance according to the “Side” discrimination rule (side
rule) requires a nose poke to the cue port at a designated spatial location
(valid side; left or right), regardless of illumination (see Fig. 2a). In side
rule trials, the light cue was presented in the pseudo-randomly selected
side to ensure that the cue was presented at each side no more than two
consecutive trials. Rats were trained on an initial rule (dimension) to a
performance criterion of 10 consecutive correct (rewarded) responses,
and then immediately switched to the alternate rule.
After pretraining, rats were trained daily on the set-shifting task, being
required to shift their response patterns between the light and side rules.
Each session consisted of four sets. The first set was pseudo-randomly
assigned with either light or side rule. After 10 consecutive correct re-
sponses, the next set with the alternate rule commenced. Set-shifting was
not explicitly signaled; thus, rats had to learn it by trial and error based on
delivery or omission of the reward. A successful training session con-
sisted of 4 sets completed in 90 min. For the counterbalancing of the poke
direction, the light cue was not presented in the same port more than
twice. In addition, each session included two side rule sets using right and
left ports as the valid side; thus, the side rule trials included equivalently
mixed right- and left-poking trials. After establishing stable baseline per-
formance (at least 3 consecutive successful sessions), rats were subjected
to electrode implantation surgery. The first recording was initiated only
after the recovery of the stable baseline performance.
In each trial, a correct response was rewarded with a sugar pellet,
whereas an incorrect response was not rewarded. Occurrence of an in-
correct response reset the number of consecutive trials to 0. Immediately
after each response, the food trough in the opposite wall of the chamber
was illuminated, regardless of the accuracy of response, until rats poked
to the trough to end the trial. After 10 s intertrial interval, the next trial
was initiated as the light cue was turned on.

 Electrophysiology
Single-unit activity was recorded simultaneously via bilateral eight-
channel Teflon-insulated stainless steel 50 �m microwire arrays (NB
Laboratories). Unity-gain junction field effect transistor headstages were
attached to a headstage cable and commutator nonrestrictive to the ani-
mals’ movement. Signals were amplified via a multichannel amplifier
(Plexon). Spikes were bandpass filtered between 220 Hz and 6 kHz, am-
plified 500�, and digitized at 40 kHz. Single-unit activity was then digi-
tally high-pass filtered at 300 Hz and LFP were low-pass filtered at 125
Hz. Threshold crossing spike waveforms were stored for offline analysis.
Single units were sorted using the Offline Sorter software package
(Plexon). Single-unit activity was further analyzed only if the unit dis-
played a stable waveform throughout the recording session. To prevent
analysis of the same unit recorded on different channels, we examined
cross-correlograms. If a unit presented a peak of activity at the time of the
reference unit’s firing, only one of the two was further analyzed. Because
each animal was allowed at least 3 d of washout between recording ses-
sions, we treated units recorded in different sessions as different units
despite the fact that the same unit may have been serially recorded. This
approach allowed for the most conservative assessment of unit identity.
Units meeting these criteria were used in all single-unit analyses. We did
not exclude putative fast-spiking interneurons from our samples. Only
1.9% of total units displayed the mean firing rates �20 Hz.
Neural data analysis for the home cage recording
Analyses of single-unit data were conducted with MATLAB (The Math-
Works) and SPSS statistical software (IBM). The drug-free baseline pe-
riod was 27 min consisting of 9 � 3 min bins, and the postinjection
period was 108 min of 36 � 3 min bins. Each unit’s activity in the baseline
and postinjection periods was Z-score normalized using the mean and
the SD of the baseline firing rate. Differences in baseline firing rate be-
tween dose groups were assessed with the Kruskal–Wallis test. Two-way
repeated-measures ANOVA was used to assess the effects of dose, time
period, and their interaction on the population activity. Post hoc analyses
with Bonferroni correction were used for between- and within-dose
group comparisons subsequently. For all tests, the Greenhouse–Geisser
correction was applied as necessary. All statistical tests were specified as
two-sided.
To examine how the FG7142-induced inhibitory effect on population
activity was manifested in individual units, each unit was classified based
on modulation of its postinjection activity. For classification, the upper
and lower bounds of the 95% confidence interval of the normalized
activity were used (Homayoun and Moghaddam, 2007). Units crossing
the upper or lower bound in 3 consecutive 3 min bins were classified into
the “Activated” or “Inhibited” subgroup, respectively. Units that satisfied
both criteria in different time bins were grouped as “Bidirectional.” The
remaining units were labeled as “No-change.” The distribution of units
in these subgroups was compared between dose groups using the fisher’s
exact test. All � levels were set to 0.05.
Behavioral data analysis for the set-shifting task experiment
All behavioral performance measures (the numbers of trials to criterion,
errors, percentage of correct trials, and reaction time) were quantitated,
including all corresponding trials. For all eight rats, a binomial test (one-
tailed) was used to examine whether each rat performed the task signif-
icantly above the chance level. One-way ANOVA was used to assess the
dose effect on total trials and time to complete the task. Two-way
repeated-measures ANOVA was used to examine the effect of dose, rule,
and their interaction on the number of trials to criterion, the number of
errors, the percentage of correct trials, and the reaction time for action or
food trough entry. Post hoc tests used the Bonferroni procedure.
Neural data analysis for the set-shifting task experiment
Baseline and periaction activity analysis. To examine how FG7142 affected
the baseline neuronal activity during task performance, the firing rate of
each unit was measured within the 3 s window beginning 3.5 s before
each trial onset, averaged across trials, and compared across dose groups.
To assess the individual neuronal activity within periaction time periods,
each unit’s firing rate was computed in 50 ms bins within the periaction
windows (�2 to 2 s relative to the action occurring at time � 0). The
firing rate of each unit was averaged across trials. The trial-averaged
firing rate of each unit was Z-score normalized to that of its baseline
period. Units were categorized as “Activated” or “Inhibited” within pre-
action (�2 to 0 s) and postaction (0 to 2 s) relative to the action occurring
at time � 0 periods, if their average normalized activity contained two or
more consecutive 50 ms bins with Z � 1.96 or Z � �1.96, respectively.
The remaining units were categorized as “No-change.” These criteria
were validated using a bootstrap analysis on the baseline period (a 2 s
window beginning 2.5 s before the trial onset) of each unit. For each unit,
the baseline window was randomly sampled with replacement 10,000
times. The proportion of 2 s windows that resampled activity reached the
significance criteria is a measure of the expected false-positive rate for
that unit during any 2 s window. The expected false-positive rate was � �
0.0023. Differences in the distribution of neuronal responses (activated,
inhibited, or no-change) between dose groups were assessed with Fisher’s
exact test. The normalized population activity in the preaction or post-
action period was compared across dose groups, using one-way ANOVA.
Linear regression analysis. A multiple linear regression model was used
to investigate how each unit encoded task-relevant information. The
following multiple linear regression model was used:
Spike Count � �0 � �1TR(t) � �2R(t) � �3R(t � 1) � �4D(t)
� �5D(t � 1) � �6RT(t)
(1)
where TR(t) represented the task rule on trial t (0 if light, 1 if side), R(t)
is the response outcome on trial t (1 if correct, 0 if incorrect), R(t � 1) is
the previous response outcome on trial t � 1 (1 if correct, 0 if incorrect),
D(t) is the poke direction on trial t (1 if right, 0 if left), D(t � 1) is the poke
direction on trial t � 1 (1 if right, 0 if left), RT(t) is the reaction time on
trial t (1 if high, 0 if medium, �1 if low latency, for each animal). To
investigate the neural representation of the task rule specifically in CF
trials, we used a slightly modified regression model (below) in which we
selected CF trials in both side and light rule sets, and then examined the
encoding of CF trials of one rule, relative to the trials of the other rule.
Spike Count � �0 � �1TR(t; CF) � �2R(t) � �3R(t � 1) � �4D(t)
� �5D(t � 1) � �6RT(t)
(2)
where TR(t; CF) represented CF trials of one rule (1) and all trials of the
other rule (0), and all the other terms were represented identically as in
the above regression model. Initial trials of each set were excluded from
the regression analysis to ensure that rats were aware of the set-shifting.
Both correct and incorrect trials after the fifth correct response of each set
were included. The regression analysis was conducted for the spike count
of each unit, in a window of 1 s width that slides in steps of 0.2 s within the
range of 2 s before and after the instrumental action. Units that had (1)
three or more consecutive or (2) four or more sliding windows with
significant coefficients (p � 0.05, based on the t test) for each covariate
(�1 to �6) during the periaction time period of interest were considered
to encode the corresponding variable. The stringency of this criterion was
verified by calculating the false-positive rate when the regression was
performed on bootstrap resampled trials (1000 samples; the expected
false-positive rate �0.05). To compare the proportions of units signaling
trial types, current or previous response outcome between dose groups,
Fisher’s exact test was used.
To investigate how the dmPFC neural representation of the task rule
evolved from early to late phases of a set, trials in each session were
divided into two subsets: one comprising the first half of the trials in each
set and the other comprising the second half of the trials. We then quan-
tified the neuronal selectivity for the two rules using a sliding receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) analysis (see Fig. 8c). The area under the
ROC curve was used as an index of neuronal selectivity. A value of 0.5 was
indicative of no selectivity between two conditions, whereas a value of 1
was interpreted as complete discriminability. ROC values were calculated
with a sliding 0.4 s window in 0.2 s steps. The peak ROC values in the
preaction period were used for comparison. A ROC analysis also was
applied to the rule-encoding dmPFC units to quantify their discrim-
inability of the rule in side CF and light CF trials (see Fig. 10c).

 Population decoding analysis. After examining the individual neuronal
encoding of task variables, we quantified the population level coding
using a Poisson naive Bayes’ classifier. In general, this decoding method
works by training the classifier to “learn” which patterns of neural activ-
ity are indicative of particular task conditions (e.g., which is the current
rule). In the training phase, the association of different patterns of neural
activity with different task conditions is learned from a subset of data
(training set). In the test phase, the reliability of the association is then
assessed with a separate set of data (test set) based on how accurately the
classifier can predict the present task conditions.
For training and testing, we used a cross-validation procedure with the
following steps. (1) For each neuron, data from 20 trials were randomly
selected for each of the 2 conditions (e.g., light and side rules). For each of
these trials, data from all neurons were concatenated to create a pseudo-
population response vector (i.e., neurons that were recorded under the
same conditions but in separate sessions were treated as if they had been
recorded simultaneously). (2) These pseudo-population vectors are
grouped into 20 splits of the sampled data, with each split containing one
pseudo-population response vector for each task condition. (3) A classi-
fier was trained using 19 splits of the data and tested with the remaining
split. This procedure was repeated 20 times, leaving a different split at
each time (i.e., a 20-fold leave-one-split-out cross-validation was used)
(Meyers et al., 2012). This procedure (steps 1–3) was repeated 50 times
for each 200 ms window sliding in steps of 50 ms within the 4 s periaction
period.
Specifically in each repetition, we have a Poisson likelihood function
given by the following:
P�x
�
t � Ck� ��
i�1
D �ki,t
xi,t e��ki,t
xi,t !
(3)
where x
�
t is a pseudo-population vector of spike counts at tth sliding
window within a trial, k indicates a particular rule (side or light) or a
response outcome (correct or incorrect response); thus, k takes on either
1 or 2. i indicates unit label, 1 to D. �ki,t is the parameter for the Poisson
distribution estimated by the following:
�ki,t �
1
Nk �
n�Ck
xni,t
(4)
The posterior probability of a particular rule or an outcome given the
spike count vector is provided by Bayes’ theorem as follows:
P�Ck � x
�
t� �
P�x
�
t � Ck� P�Ck�
P�x
�

(5)
We assumed a flat prior probability; thus, P(Ck) is a constant. Hence, the
classifier predicts the task condition with maximum probability given the
pseudo-population activity.

(6)
The result of population decoding analysis was quantified as the percent-
age of correctly predicted test splits, which we termed “decoding accu-
racy.” The mean and SD of decoding accuracy were calculated across the
scores of 50 resampling procedures.
To examine whether there are dynamic temporal patterns in the
dmPFC neuronal signaling of the task rule (i.e., do the neurons encode
the task rule differentially at different times), we ran a temporal-cross-
training analysis (Meyers et al., 2012) (see Fig. 9c–e). In this analysis, a
classifier is trained with data from one time point and then tested on data
from different trials that were taken either from the same time period or
a different time period, using the same steps (1–4) described above.
Behavioral testing on the elevated plus maze
Although numerous previous reports have established the anxiogenic
effects of FG7142 (Pellow and File, 1986; Cole et al., 1995; Atack et al.,
2005), we assessed the effect of FG7142 versus vehicle on the elevated plus
maze (EPM) to ensure that a similar effect is replicated in our hands. Ten
minutes after injection, rats were transported into the testing room and
placed on the center of the EPM with their heads facing an open arm. The
experimenter then left the room, and the rat’s behavior was video re-
corded for 5 min. The EPM consisted of two open arms (45 � 10 cm)
with transparent 1-cm-high edging, and two closed arms (45 � 10 � 48
cm) diverging from a common central platform (10 � 10 cm) elevated 90
cm above the floor. Video records were analyzed using an automatic
video tracking software (ANY-maze, Stoelting) to quantify the following:
(1) time spent in the open arms, closed arms, or center platform; (2)
number of entries made into open and closed arms; and (3) total distance
traveled on the maze. These measures were compared between vehicle
and FG7142-injected groups using independent-samples t test.
Results
Inhibitory effect of FG7142 on PFC neuronal
population activity
In total, 138 dmPFC and 184 OFC units were recorded from
histologically verified electrodes of 11 freely behaving rats in
home cages (Fig. 1a); the mean baseline firing rate before admin-
istration of drug was 5.67 � 0.50 Hz in dmPFC and 4.47 � 0.35
Hz in OFC. There was no difference in these levels across dose
groups in either subregion (Kruskal–Wallis test, dmPFC; �2
2 �
3.32, p � 0.19, OFC; �2
2 � 2.03, p � 0.36).
We examined the impact of doses of FG7142 (5 and 10 mg/kg)
that produces physiological, neurochemical, and cognitive defi-
cits (Murphy et al., 1996b; Mikkelsen et al., 2005; Evans and
Lowry, 2007; Pehrson et al., 2013) without inhibiting the animals’
motor abilities. Treatment with FG7142 (10 mg/kg i.p.) reduced
the spontaneous firing rate of subpopulations of dmPFC and
OFC units (Fig. 1b–e). We quantified the impact of FG7142 on
both population activity (Z-score) and on individual units. For
the latter, units that fired significantly below or above preinjec-
tion baseline in 3 consecutive 3 min bins were classified as “In-
hibited” and “Activated.” Units that were both inhibited and
activated were classified as “Bidirectional.” The remaining units
were classified as “No-change.” In the dmPFC, a significant in-
teraction between dose group and time period was observed
(two-way repeated-measures ANOVA, F(2,135) � 8.58, p �
0.001). Both 5 and 10 mg/kg doses of FG7142 suppressed popu-
lation activity compared with baseline or vehicle (Fig. 1f; post hoc
test, p values �0.01). A substantial proportion of units inhibited,
whereas fewer units increased or bidirectionally modulated their
firing rates. The distribution of units in inhibited, activated, and
bidirectional subgroups was significantly different from that of
vehicle units (Fig. 1g; � 2 test, 5 mg/kg; �3
2 � 10.61, p � 0.014, 10
mg/kg; �3
2 � 17.51, p � 0.0006). OFC population activity was
suppressed by FG7142 in a similar manner. A significant interac-
tion between dose group and time period was detected (two-way
repeated-measures ANOVA, F(2,179) � 8.39, p � 3.0 � 10 �4).
FG7142 at 5 mg/kg significantly suppressed population activity
compared with baseline or vehicle (Fig. 1h; post hoc test, p values
�0.0001). A significant suppression was observed compared
with that of the baseline (post hoc test, p � 0.009), as well as a
trend toward suppression compared with that of vehicle injection
(post hoc test, p � 0.07) after 10 mg/kg injection. A substantial
proportion of units inhibited their activity, and the distribution
of inhibited, activated, and bidirectional subgroups was signifi-
cantly different from that of vehicle units (Fig. 1i; � 2 test, 5 mg/
kg; �3
2 � 17.42, p � 0.0006, 10 mg/kg; �3

both dmPFC and OFC, we verified that the interactions between
dose group and time period were significant, when examined
using the raw firing rates without Z-score normalization (two-
way repeated-measures ANOVA, dmPFC; F(2,135) � 3.16, p �

 0.05, OFC; F(2,179) � 10.21, p � 1.0 � 10 �4). Similarly, in both
regions, we observed significant suppression of the raw popula-
tion activity from the baseline after 5 or 10 mg/kg injection of
FG7142 (post hoc test, p values �0.003).
Impact of FG7142 on set-shifting task performance
We investigated changes in dmPFC and OFC neural correlates
that may underlie alterations in cognitive behavior in anxiety.
Rats were trained in an operant set-shifting task (Darrah et al.,
2008). This task demands a high cognitive load and requires rule-
based control of instrumental behavior by requiring rats to dis-
criminate between two rules, each involving a distinct perceptual
dimension: spatial location and a light stimulus (Fig. 2a). Thus,
the task requires rats to form associations between a stimulus, a
response, and an outcome for each rule, and then flexibly switch
between the two rules based on the response outcome. Animals
weretrainedbeforeelectrodeimplantationtosuccessfullyperform3
consecutive extradimensional shifts per test session, with sets
pseudo-randomizedforeachsession.Stablebaselineperformance(3
consecutive successful sessions) was reached in 18 � 3.0 training
sessions. Performance remained consistent after the surgical im-
plantation of electrode arrays (total trials; one-way ANOVA,
F(1,14) � 0.44, p � 0.52, total time; one-way ANOVA, F(1,14) � 0.53,
p � 0.48, number of trials to criterion; two-way repeated-measures
ANOVA, F(1,14) � 1.74, p � 0.21, number of errors; two-way
repeated-measures ANOVA, F(1,14) � 1.58, p � 0.23).
Systemic injection of FG7142 did not impede the ability of
animals to engage in and to complete the set-shifting task. Ani-
mals performed well above the chance level (binomial test, p
values �2.32 � 10 �7) and did not display overt performance
impairment. The number of total trials required to complete the
task (i.e., to perform three consecutive extradimensional shifts)
was similar across vehicle and dose groups (Fig. 2b; one-way
ANOVA, F(2,21) � 1.28, p � 0.30). Total time taken to complete
the task also was not significantly different across groups (Fig. 2b;
one-way ANOVA, F(2,21) � 1.91, p � 0.17). This allowed us to
move forward with analyzing specific aspects of rule-dependent
performance without confounding effects of the anxiogenic
treatment producing motor and indiscriminate cognitive impair-
ments. We then compared the number of trials to criterion (10
consecutive correct trials) in the light and side rule sets across
dose groups. A significant interaction between dose and rule was
found, as rats that received FG7142 reached the criterion with
fewer trials in the light rule, but with more trials in the side rule
sets compared with when they received vehicle injection (Fig. 2c;
two-way repeated-measures ANOVA, F(2,21) � 4.26, p � 0.028,
post hoc test, 10 mg/kg, p � 0.012). The rule-dependent modula-
tion of performance was echoed in the number of errors. A sig-
nificant interaction between dose and rule was found with the
number of errors in side rule sets increasing, and that of the
light rule sets decreasing after FG7142 injection (Fig. 2d; two-
way repeated-measures ANOVA, F(2,21) � 5.93, p � 0.009; post
hoc test, 10 mg/kg, p � 0.001). Similar numbers of trials to
criterion and errors were detected in the side- and light rule
sets during performance after vehicle injection (post hoc test,
vehicle, p values �0.21).
Performance during the side rule sets was further subtyped
based on correspondence between illuminated and correct side
(Fig. 2a, bottom right). Specifically, in approximately half of the
pseudo-randomly selected side rule trials, the correct choice was
the illuminated side (nonconflict [NCF] trials), whereas the in-
correct choice side was illuminated in the rest of the trials (con-
flict [CF] trials). Trials in the light rule set also were subtyped
based on correspondence between illuminated and previously
correct side (Fig. 2a, bottom left). In approximately half of the
light rule trials, a light cue was presented in the previously correct

 side (NCF trials), whereas the light cue was presented in the pre-
viously incorrect side in the other half of the trials (CF trials). A
significant effect of trial type was found on the percentage correct,
indicating distinct performance depending on trial types (Fig. 2e;
two-way repeated-measures ANOVA, F(3,63) � 172.15, p � 1.0 �
10 �4). As expected, animals’ performance was more prone to
errors in CF trials compared with NCF trials, especially during
the side rule trials (Fig. 2e; post hoc test, p values �0.032). Treat-
ment with FG7142 significantly modified the error rates in the
side CF trials. A significant interaction between dose and trial
type was found (F(6,63) � 4.05, p � 0.002), and post hoc analysis
revealed that the percentage correct in the side rule CF trials was
lower during performance after 10 mg/kg injection, compared
with that of vehicle injection (Fig. 2e; post hoc test, p � 0.049).
Percentage correct in light CF trials was higher than that of side
CF trials and did not differ across dose groups (Fig. 2e; post hoc
test, p values �0.18). Performance in NCF trials was equivalent
(side rule) or even greater (light rule) after
FG7142 injection. Collectively, these per-
formance patterns indicate that anxiety
induces a response bias toward the light
cue, leading to increased distractibility by
the irrelevant cue in the side rule, but
equivalent or even enhanced performance
in light rule trials. Reaction time (RT), the
latency from the cue onset to the action
(nose poke), also was measured separately
for each trial type. In all trial types, RT
trended toward a dose-dependent in-
crease but did not significantly differ
across dose groups (Fig. 2f; two-way
repeated-measures ANOVA, post hoc test,
p values �0.06). The latency for reward
retrieval was similar across dose groups,
indicating that the increase in RT is not
associated with indiscriminate changes in
locomotion or motivation for reward
(two-way repeated-measures ANOVA,
post hoc test, p values �0.9).
Impact of FG7142 on neural correlates
of set-shifting task performance
The PFC neural correlates of task perfor-
mance in response to FG7142 were ana-
lyzed
at
individual
neuronal
and
population levels, based on single-unit ac-
tivity recorded from histologically verified
electrodes in dmPFC and OFC (Fig. 1a).
We first quantified the baseline firing rate
and the baseline-normalized periaction
activity across all trials. The time of action
was identified by the detection of an entry
to the nose-poke port, and all preaction or
postaction neuronal activity was aligned
to timing of the port entry. Consistent with
the home cage recording result, dmPFC
units in FG7142-treated groups had lower
baseline firing rates compared with the ve-
hicle treated units (Fig. 3d; one-way
ANOVA, F(2,188) � 5.90, p � 0.003). How-
ever, the trial-averaged normalized activity
(Fig. 3e; one-way ANOVA, F(2,188) � 0.82,
p � 0.44) and the fraction of activated units
(Fig. 3f; �2 test, p values �0.07) within the preaction or postaction
period did not differ across dose groups.
In OFC, a nonsignificant reduction in the baseline firing rate
was observed in FG7142-treated units (Fig. 4d; one-way ANOVA,
F(2,84) � 0.78, p � 0.46). This contrasted the significant reduction
observed during home cage recording and may be due to the
impact of context (operant box vs home cage) on the baseline
spontaneous activity of OFC neurons, or the difference in the
statistical power given the different sample sizes. Unlike dmPFC
units, and as expected, OFC units responded more robustly dur-
ing the postaction (outcome) period (Fig. 4a–c). This postaction
OFC response was not affected by FG7142, as similar trial-
averaged normalized activity (Fig. 4e; one-way ANOVA, F(2,84) �
0.14, p � 0.87) and fraction of activated units (Fig. 4f; � 2 test, p
values �0.24) were observed across dose groups.
We then examined the individual neuronal encoding of vari-
ous task-relevant variables, such as the rule, current and previous

Park et al. • Anxiety Evokes Hypofrontality and Disrupts Rule-Relevant Encoding
 response outcomes, poke direction, and RT, using a multiple
linear regression model (see Materials and Methods). We first
examined the neuronal encoding of the response outcome of
previous and current trials, which are the two critical features for
the outcome-based guidance of behavior during the task. With all
predictive variables accounting for vari-
ability in neuronal activity, some dmPFC
and OFC units encoded the response out-
come of the previous and/or the current
trial especially during the preaction and
postaction period, respectively, consistent
with the literature (Sul et al., 2010; Strait
et al., 2014) (Figs. 5, 6). Encoding of the
previous response outcome was neither
region-specific nor affected by FG7142
(Fig. 5a,b; Table 1; � 2 test, p values
�0.08). To test how reliably the previous
response outcome could be decoded at the
population level, we performed a decod-
ing analysis with the entire dmPFC popu-
lation of each dose group, using a linear
classifier (see Materials and Methods).
The response outcome of the previous
trial could be decoded from the dmPFC
population well above the chance level
across the periaction period in all dose
groups (Fig. 5c,d). Greater proportions of
dmPFC and OFC units encoded the re-
sponse outcome of the current trial, par-
ticularly
in
the
postaction
period,
regardless of vehicle or FG7142 injection
(Fig. 6a,b; Table 1; � 2 test, p values
�0.10). The classifier generated a highly
accurate decoding of the current response
outcome, especially during the postaction
period, consistent with the individual
neuronal encoding (Fig. 6c,d). In sum-
mary, substantial dmPFC and OFC units
encoded previous and/or current re-
sponse outcome, but this encoding was
not significantly affected by the anx-
iogenic manipulation, suggesting that the
trial-to-trial signaling of the response out-
come were intact in anxiety.
The regression analysis also indicated
that FG7142 treatment did not influence
the fraction of units encoding previous
and current poke direction in dmPFC
(previous direction: vehicle, 17%; 5 mg/
kg, 12%; 10 mg/kg, 11%; current direc-
tion: vehicle, 25%; 5 mg/kg, 31%; 10
mg/kg, 20%) and OFC (previous direc-
tion: vehicle, 6%; 5 mg/kg, 21%; 10 mg/
kg, 13%; current direction: vehicle,
15%; 5 mg/kg, 31%; 10 mg/kg, 29%).
Similar lack of effect was observed in
units that encoded the RT for the action
in dmPFC (vehicle, 17%; 5 mg/kg, 12%;
10 mg/kg, 11%) and OFC (vehicle, 6%; 5
mg/kg, 21%; 10 mg/kg, 13%).
We next analyzed the neural represen-
tation of the task rule. For this, we focused
on the encoding during the preaction pe-
riod because it is the temporal window
that immediately precedes the action, and thus encoding within
this window may guide the action. A substantial fraction of
vehicle-treated dmPFC units, as exemplified in Figure 7, encoded
the rule in the preaction period (Fig. 8a). The anxiogenic treat-

coefficients for the task rule covariate of all rule-encoding and
nonencoding units are shown across the periaction time period in
Figure 8b. The neural representation of the task rule may gradu-
ally evolve after shifting, as the animals initially try to figure out
the valid rule by trial and error, and finally attain the rule in the
later phase of the set. We tested this by comparing the degrees of
neural discriminability based on the rule in the two subsets of
data comprising the first half and the second half trials of each set,
using a sliding ROC analysis (see Materials and Methods). We
found that the vast majority of the rule-encoding dmPFC units in
the vehicle (19 of 24 units, paired t test, t(23) � 3.35, p � 0.003)
and the 5 mg/kg (15 of 21 units, paired t test, t(20) � 3.69, p �
0.001) groups showed enhanced selectivity in the late compared
with the early phase of a set (Fig. 8c). The emerging ROC values
from the first to second half of trials corresponded to low and
high behavioral accuracy (Fig. 8d; overall percentage correct:
66% and 87%), demonstrating the association between emerging
neural representation of the rule and growing behavioral accu-
racy. The emerging pattern of rule selectivity was weakened after
animals received the 10 mg/kg dose (Fig. 8c; 7 of 12 units, paired
t test, t(11) � 1.34, p � 0.21), even when the behavioral choice
accuracy appeared high in the second half (Fig. 8d).
Reduced individual neuronal rule representation should be
associated with diminished encoding of the rule at the population
level. We corroborated this using the linear classifier. The classi-
fier decoded the task rule corresponding to current trials with
high accuracy from the vehicle population, but with far lower
accuracy from the 10 mg/kg population, indicating that the anx-
iogenic manipulation was associated with reduced rule represen-
tation by the dmPFC population (Fig. 9).
We next investigated the impact of the anxiogenic treatment
on neural representation of the task rule in CF trials. We identi-
fied the CF trials in either side- or light rule sets (Fig. 2a) and then
examined the encoding of CF trials of one rule, relative to the
trials of the other rule, using a multiple linear regression model
(see Materials and Methods). Examples of individual dmPFC
units that encoded side CF trials relative to light rule trials are
shown in Figure 10a. Figure 10b illustrates that the proportion of
side CF trial encoding dmPFC units was significantly reduced by
10 mg/kg FG7142 compared with vehicle (� 2 test, �1
2 � 5.83, p �
0.016). This is consistent with the behavior data (Fig. 2e) showing
increased error propensity in side CF trials at this dose. Fewer
rule-encoding units were found in CF trials of the light rule,
regardless of the dose (Fig. 10b; � 2 test, p values �0.39), which is
consistent with the comparable performance across dose groups
observed in these trials (Fig. 2e). The difference between the frac-
tions of rule-encoding units in side CF and light CF trials may
reflect differential degrees of rule representation between these
trials (i.e., more robust rule representation may be observed in
side CF than light CF trials). To test this, we applied an ROC
analysis to the rule-encoding dmPFC units identified earlier
without subdivision of CF and NCF trials (Fig. 8a) and quantified
their discriminability of the rule for side CF and light CF trials
(see Materials and Methods). We found that greater numbers of
rule-encoding dmPFC units in the vehicle (15 of 24 units, paired
t test, t(23) � 2.36, p � 0.027) and the 5 mg/kg (14 of 21 units,
paired t test, t(20) � 2.28, p � 0.034) groups showed enhanced
discriminability in the side CF than light CF trials (Fig. 10c). This
difference was dampened in 10 mg/kg treated units (6 of 12,
paired t test, t(11) � 0.91, p � 0.38) (Fig. 10c). Thus, the dmPFC
neural representation of the task rule in CF trials was more pro-
nounced under the side rule, where the conflicting light stimulus
was presented explicitly and continuously throughout a set. The
reduction of this representation by the anxiogenic treatment may
underlie its effect on increased error propensity and performance
bias.
Weaker task-rule representation was observed in the OFC, as
fewer proportions of rule-encoding OFC units were found, with-
out a significant difference across dose groups (Table 1; � 2 test, p
values �0.25). Likewise, the OFC rule representation in CF trials
was not evident and was not affected by anxiety (Table 1; � 2 test,
p values �0.18). These suggest that, unlike dmPFC neurons, OFC
neurons do not encode anxiety-induced changes in rule-based
task performance.
FG7142 effect on anxiety-like behavior and locomotion
measured on the elevated plus maze
Consistent with previous reports (Pellow and File, 1986; Cole et
al., 1995; Atack et al., 2005; Evans and Lowry, 2007), FG7142
induced an anxiety-like state when measured using the EPM (Fig.
11a,b). Rats placed on the EPM after injection of FG7142 showed
significantly fewer entries (Fig. 11c; independent t test, t(12) �
3.03, p � 0.01) and reduced time (Fig. 11d; independent t test,
t(12) � 3.01, p � 0.02) spent in open arms, compared with
vehicle-injected rats. The total distance traveled on the maze did
not differ significantly between vehicle and FG7142-injected
groups (Fig. 11e; independent t test, t(12) � 1.93, p � 0.08); thus,
the anxiety-like behavior was not attributed to a deficit in loco-
motion.
Discussion
Anxiety has been studied extensively as a stand-alone construct in
laboratory animals (e.g., Adhikari et al., 2010, 2011; Milad and
Quirk, 2012; Calhoon and Tye, 2015). The results have contrib-
uted to our understanding of the brain circuits that are altered in
anxious and fearful animals. Detrimental impacts of human anx-
iety, however, extend well beyond a general aversive “fearful”
state and involve disruption of ongoing goal-directed behaviors
that are necessary for day-to-day functioning. A critical example
is disruption of PFC-mediated cognitive functions, such as flex-
ible shifting to new behavioral strategies or overcoming distract-
ing stimuli (Bishop, 2007; Eysenck et al., 2007). Here we sought to
fill a fundamental void in the literature by addressing how a back-
ground state of anxiety influences encoding of flexible decision
making by PFC neurons. We used a clinically relevant experi-
mental model of anxiety while recording from dmPFC and OFC
neurons of rats at wakeful rest or while they were engaged in an
extradimensional set-shifting task. We find that anxiety en-
grosses a substantial number of spontaneously active PFC neu-
rons and, more importantly, leads to diminished representation

The challenge of modeling sustained anxiety in
behaving animals
Anxiety is a construct in Research Domain Criteria of National
Institute of Mental Health’s Strategic Plan and a debilitating
symptom of most psychiatric disorders. Anxiety generally is not a
rapid neuronal “event” but a “state” that may be sustained for
many minutes to hours. In a real-life situation, the impact of
anxiety extends beyond its general aversive state and impairs on-
going behaviors that use cognitive and affective processing. The
neurodynamic nature of this impairment has been difficult to
address, in part, because previous electrophysiological studies
focused on fear conditioning and avoidance paradigms as a po-
tential measure of anxiety. Although these studies have revealed a
role for PFC in regulating freezing and avoidance behaviors (Mi-
lad and Quirk, 2002; Burgos-Robles et al., 2009), they cannot
reveal how the PFC neural correlates of cognitive and motivated
behavioral events are modulated by anxiety.
To study anxiety-related PFC neural processing during cogni-
tive and motivated behaviors, it would be ideal to produce a
sustained state of anxiety in animals that does not prevent their
task performance. We used a pharmacological model of sus-
tained anxiety that has excellent cross-species validity. Inverse
agonists of allosteric benzodiazepine binding sites in GABAA re-
ceptors produce an anxiogenic state (Evans and Lowry, 2007).
This is an “old” approach, with one of the initial studies (Ninan et
al., 1982) reporting a behavioral syndrome in rhesus monkeys
that mimicked physiological and affective features of human anx-
iety. Although these drugs produce freezing or may have procon-
vulsive properties at very high doses, their symptomatic impact at
moderate doses is relatively specific in the context of anxiety, in
that behavioral and perceptual effects unrelated to anxiety (such
as hallucination) are not reported. A well-characterized drug in
this class is FG7142, which has been shown to produce PFC-
mediated cognitive deficits (Murphy et al., 1996a), as well as
anxiety-related cardiovascular, and neurochemical effects in hu-
mans and laboratory animals (Evans and Lowry, 2007). This ap-

 proach provided a practical tool for
studying the impact of sustained anxiety
on cognitive task performance.
Effects of anxiety on spontaneous
PFC activity
Anxiety induced by FG7142 suppressed
dmPFC and OFC population activity.
This effect contrasts the increase in PFC
firing rate shown previously in traditional
rodent models of anxiety (Adhikari et al.,
2011). Our findings, however, are consis-
tent with human imaging studies that
have reported reduced activation of PFC
in patients with anxiety disorders (Shin et
al., 2001; Phelps et al., 2004). These data
further suggest that the “hypofrontality”
commonly associated with a general state
of anxiety is caused by suppression of the
spontaneously active PFC neurons.
Anxiogenic
compounds,
including
FG7142, decrease the chloride flux via
GABAA receptors, which should produce
a direct excitatory effect on firing rate of
single neurons. The observed inhibitory
influence, therefore, suggests the involve-
ment of networks of GABA interneurons
and
multiple
inhibitory
processes
mediated by them (White et al., 2000). Al-
ternatively, similar to stress, indirect
mechanisms, such as activation of norad-
renergic or dopaminergic projections to
the PFC, may be involved (Reinhard et al., 1982; Goldstein et al.,
1996; Arnsten, 2000; Gamo et al., 2015). Dopamine recently has
been implicated in mediating anxiety-like behaviors (Lammel et
al., 2012). Selective activation of dopamine release in mPFC by
the fiber photometry had anxiogenic effects in mice (Gunaydin et
al., 2014). A hyper-reactive mesoprefrontal circuit was associated
with clinical anxiety in humans (Cha et al., 2014). Consistent
with PFC activation of dopamine release being anxiogenic,
FG7142 produces a sustained increase in dopamine release selec-
tively in the PFC (Bradberry et al., 1991; Murphy et al., 1996a).
Importantly, the time course of increase in dopamine release is
similar to the duration of PFC neuronal inhibition we observed
(Bradberry et al., 1991). Postsynaptic effects of dopamine on PFC
neurons are primarily inhibitory (Sesack and Bunney, 1989; Sea-
mans et al., 2001; Gorelova et al., 2002); thus, the anxiety-induced
reduction in PFC neuronal activity may be mediated, in part, by
selective activation of dopamine release in PFC. Of note, high
levels of dopamine D1 or noradrenergic �-1 receptor stimula-
tion, similar to the impact of FG7142, reduce PFC neuronal firing
in monkeys (Arnsten, 2009).
Modality-specific deficits in set-shifting task performance
The dose of the anxiogenic compound used here did not prevent
animals from successfully completing trials in the set-shifting
task. This allowed us to unveil selective and clinically relevant
anxiety-induced deficits in rule-shifting behavior. A critical as-
pect of our task was that it included multiple extradimensional
shifts within each session. Animals had been well trained with the
discrimination rules as well as shifting between them before the
test session; thus, the task was sensitive to measure the flexible
switching between rules based on the action-outcome contin-
gency. FG7142-injected rats readily shifted from the side to the
light rule, as evidenced by fewer errors and trials to criterion in
the light rule. However, when shifting to the side rule, increased
errors were observed during what we coined “conflict trials” (i.e.,
trials where light was presented in the incorrect side). This selec-
tive deficit suggests impaired capacity to disengage from the pre-
viously relevant sensory dimension, especially when the
outmoded cue was visible. This deficit is consistent with in-
creased perseverative errors after acute stress in rodents (Butts et
al., 2013) and monkeys (Murphy et al., 1996a, b), and persevera-
tive behavioral patterns in patients with anxiety-related disorders
(Purcell et al., 1998; Eysenck et al., 2007).
Our observation further suggests that the detrimental impact
of anxiety on rule shifting is modality specific and especially vul-
nerable when a shift is required in the presence of previously
relevant sensory stimuli. From a broader standpoint, these be-
havioral findings indicate that anxiety may bias decision making
to a sensory-based process that is less flexible and more prone to
visual and other sensory distractors. These findings, therefore,
support the notion that, under anxiety, behavioral selection is
skewed by salient environmental stimuli at the expense of flexible
top-down guided choices.
Neuronal encoding of deficits in behavioral rule shifting
in anxiety
The baseline firing rates of dmPFC and OFC neurons were sim-
ilarly inhibited by the anxiogenic treatment during home cage
recording and task performance. During task performance, vary-
ing degrees of neuronal encoding of the response outcome,
choice direction, and RT were observed in both regions, and
signaling of these variables involving a trial-to-trial processing

Park et al. • Anxiety Evokes Hypofrontality and Disrupts Rule-Relevant Encoding
 was not significantly affected by anxiety. In contrast, the dmPFC
neural representation of task rules was selectively diminished.
Encoding the task rule is a higher-order process that involves
representation of relationships among the task-relevant cues, ac-
tions, and outcomes. Thus, our finding suggests that the higher-
order processing, subserved by dmPFC, may be particularly
susceptible to anxiety.
Further analyses of the neural representation of the task rule
revealed dynamic aspects of the dmPFC rule encoding and its
vulnerability to anxiety. First, the rule representation gradually
evolved after the set-shifting. This growing representation is un-
likely to be an epiphenomenon of the enhanced correct choices or
increased “confidence” in choice because equivalent enhance-
ment in behavioral accuracy was observed in both rules. Thus, the
growing rule representation may contribute to the gradual im-
provement in choice accuracy. This emerging pattern in the rule
representation collapsed in anxiety, suggesting that this compo-
nent of rule representation is vulnerable to anxiety. Second, we
observed that dmPFC rule representation was different in side
versus light CF trials. This can be attributed to the fact that con-
flict arises more explicitly in the side rule due to the continuous
presence of the salient light cue. The rule representation in the
side CF trials was disrupted in anxiety in correlation with in-
creased performance errors. Collectively, these data indicate that
the anxiety-related alterations in task performance are associated
with deteriorated dmPFC representation of the task rule.
Our analyses revealed that fewer proportions of OFC, com-
pared with dmPFC, neurons signaled rule-relevant information.
The majority of OFC neurons modulated their activity in the
postaction period when the response outcome was presented, sug-
gesting specialized roles of dmPFC and OFC in encoding distinct
informationduringarewardedandcomplexcognitivetask(i.e.,task
rule vs response outcome), consistent with previous literature (Dias
et al., 1997; McAlonan and Brown, 2003; Bissonette et al., 2008). It
should be underscored that these findings do not discount a role for
OFC in mediating other adverse effects of anxiety.
In conclusion, the model of anxiety used here has been vali-
dated in humans and monkeys. Although this model is different
from conventional rodent models of anxiety, the fact that the type
of cognitive deficits and the hypofrontality associated with this
model parallel observations in the human anxiety literature, en-
hances the clinical relevance of our electrophysiology and com-

how anxiety diminishes rule-based guidance of behavior, leading
