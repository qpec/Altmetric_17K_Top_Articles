BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
3,4-Methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) is a synthetic cathinone with powerful psychostimulant effects. It selectively inhibits
the dopamine transporter (DAT) and is 10–50-fold more potent as a DAT blocker than cocaine, suggesting a high abuse liability.
The main objective of the present study was to assess the consequences of an early (adolescence) MDPV exposure on the
psychostimulant, rewarding and reinforcing effects induced by cocaine in adult mice.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH
Twenty-one days after MDPV pretreatment (1.5 mg·kg�1, s.c., twice daily for 7 days), adult mice were tested with cocaine, using
locomotor activity, conditioned place preference and self-administration (SA) paradigms. In parallel, dopamine D2 receptor
density and the expression of c-Fos and ΔFosB in the striatum were determined.
KEY RESULTS
MDPV treatment enhanced the psychostimulant and conditioning effects of cocaine. Acquisition of cocaine SA was unchanged in
mice pretreated with MDPV, whereas the breaking point achieved under a progressive ratio programme and reinstatement after
extinction were higher in this group of mice. MDPV decreased D2 receptor density but increased ΔFosB expression three-fold. As
expected, acute cocaine increased c-Fos expression, but MDPV pretreatment negatively influenced its expression. ΔFosB
accumulation declined during MDPV withdrawal, although it remained elevated in adult mice when tested for cocaine effects.
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS
MDPV exposure during adolescence induced long-lasting adaptive changes related to enhanced responsiveness to cocaine in the
adult mice that seems to lead to a higher vulnerability to cocaine abuse. This particular behaviour correlated with increased
expression of ΔFosB.

 Introduction
In
recent
years,
the
illicit
drug-market
has
changed
remarkably
and
several
new
psychoactive
substances
(NPS),
such
as
the
synthetic
cathinones,
have
been
identified. The popularity of synthetic cathinones
has
increased due to their ease of access, price and initial
legal status (Bijlsma et al., 2015; Katselou et al., 2015).
3,4-Methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) is considered as
one of the most abused synthetic cathinone and the main
ingredient of ‘bath salts’ (Zuba and Byrska, 2013; Johnson
and
Johnson,
2014)
and
able
of
triggering
powerful
psychostimulant effects (Baumann et al., 2013).
Cocaine is also a powerful psychostimulant, and its
repeated use could lead to a substance use disorder and is
often associated with other severe psychiatric and medical
complications (Pozzi et al., 2008; Walsh et al., 2009). Despite
the invasion of the illegal market by the NPS, the illicit use of
cocaine is still a persistent health problem worldwide
(UNODC,
n.d.).
Similarly,
MDPV
shows
cocaine-like
properties and selectively inhibits dopamine (DAT) and
noradrenaline transporters, being 10- to 50-fold more potent
than cocaine, as a DAT blocker (Simmler et al., 2013;
Baumann et al., 2013). Furthermore, it shows rewarding and
reinforcing effects (King et al., 2014), pointing to a similar
abuse liability to that of cocaine.
Although MDPV use could be considered as a transient
trend in drug abuse, the long-lasting consequences of its
repeated consumption are still unknown. Considering this,
it is relevant to determine whether the use of MDPV will lead
to an increased sensitivity and subsequent vulnerability to
cocaine abuse. Adolescents and young adults use MDPV as a
cheaper
and
easily
obtained
alternative
to
classical
psychostimulants. Conversely, cocaine is a more widely and
currently used psychostimulant and is generally consumed
in adulthood. Consequently, the main objective of the
present study was to assess the consequences of early and
repeated MDPV exposure on the responses of adult mice to
the psychostimulant cocaine.
A repeated (7 days) moderate dose (1.5 mg·kg�1, twice,
daily) of MDPV eliciting hyperlocomotion was chosen for
this study. After this MDPV schedule, adult mice were tested
to cocaine responses. Hence, hyperlocomotion to an acute
dose
of
cocaine
was
assayed
as
an
indicative
of
its
psychostimulant
effect.
In
a
second
experiment,
we
investigated whether MDPV schedule could enhance the
rewarding effects of cocaine, using the conditioned place
preference (CPP). Next, we evaluated the reinforcing cocaine
effects on the self-administration (SA) paradigm. Earlier
studies have shown that dopamine D2 receptors played a role
in
the
development
and
expression
of
behavioural
sensitization
(Thompson
et
al.,
2010).
Moreover,
the
expression of c-Fos and deltaFosB (ΔFosB) in some brain areas
is induced by acute or chronic exposure to virtually all drugs
of abuse and regulates their psychomotor and rewarding
effects. Therefore, we have assessed the D2 receptor density
and the expression of c-Fos and ΔFosB in dorsal and ventral
striatum.
Hence,
we
have
performed
behavioural
procedures
(hyperlocomotion, CPP and SA) and biochemical analyses
that allowed us to characterize the liability for cocaine abuse
shown by adult mice who were pretreated, as adolescents,
with MDPV.
Methods
Animals
All animal care and experimental protocols were approved by
the Animal Ethics Committee of the University of Barcelona
and
PRBB,
respectively,
under
the
supervision
of
the
Autonomic
Government
of
Catalonia,
following
the
guidelines of the European Community Council (2010/63/
EU). All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and
to reduce the number of animals used. Animal studies are
reported
in
compliance
with
the
ARRIVE
guidelines
(Kilkenny et al., 2010; McGrath and Lilley, 2015). Animals
were housed four per cage (polycarbonate with wood-derived
bedding) at 22 ± 1°C under a 12 h light/dark cycle with free
access to food and drinking water.
Our model was based on the following considerations.
Adolescence is a period of particular vulnerability to drug
addiction (Cass et al., 2013), being a period of life in which
different psychiatric disorders emerge (Paus et al., 2008). For
this reason, we used for our study adolescent (PND 41–44)
male Swiss CD-1 mice (Charles River, Spain), which are
equivalent to the beginning of peri-adolescence (Spear and
Brake, 1983), and assayed cocaine effects after 21 days of
withdrawal, when animals had reached adulthood. The CD-
1 mouse strain was selected for its optimal sensitivity to the
reinforcing
and
psychostimulating
effects
of
cocaine
(McKerchar et al., 2005).

 Drug administration protocols and
experimental design
In administration regime A, MDPV (1.5 mg·kg�1) or saline
(5 mg·kg�1) was injected s.c. to mice twice daily (4 h apart)
for three consecutive days and, thereafter, they were exposed
to
the
cocaine-sensitization
protocol
(Figure
1A).
In
administration regime B, animals were also treated with
MDPV (1.5 mg·kg�1) or saline (5 mL·kg�1) twice daily for
seven consecutive days and were then housed in their home
cages until reaching adulthood (PND 69–72), when they
were
tested
for
cocaine-induced
horizontal
locomotor
activity (HLA), CPP and SA experiments as described below
(Figure 1B). This dose is equivalent to a dose in humans of
about 6 mg twice a day (Reagan-Shaw et al., 2008), in which
threshold dosages are around 1–5 mg and strong effects are
shown with 10–25 mg (2014). Re-dosing is a typical pattern
of consumption followed by consumers of such substances
to avoid an unpleasant comedown (Ross et al., 2012).
Sensitization to the locomotor responses
induced by a repeated cocaine administration
Locomotor activity was evaluated by placing the mice
individually in the actimeter boxes (24 × 24 × 24 cm) (LE881
IR, Panlab, Barcelona, Spain) provided with 14 axes (Y and
X) in a low-luminosity room. Animals were treated with saline
(n = 10) or MDPV (n = 11), according to the administration
regime A. The sensitization procedure consisted of three
phases over 14 days: habituation, treatment and challenge.
In the habituation phase (Days 6–7), mice were placed on
the actimeter boxes for 30 min immediately after an i.p. saline
injection. Treatment phase consisted of five sessions (Days
8–12). In each session, mice received daily an i.p. injection
of cocaine (7.5 mg·kg�1) immediately before being placed in
the apparatus for 15 min. Finally, following a 7 day drug-free
period after the last cocaine injection, mice were tested (Day
19 – challenge phase) with a cocaine injection (7.5 mg·kg�1,
i.p.) in the same actimeter boxes, and the locomotor activity
was registered for 15 min.
Cocaine-induced HLA
The HLA response induced by a single cocaine injection was
video-monitored (Smart 3.0, Panlab, s.l.u., Barcelona, Spain)
for
15
min
in
a
black
Plexiglass
open
field
arena
(25 × 25 × 40 cm) under low-light conditions. Two days before
testing, the animals were handled for 10 min and placed in
the black arena for habituation. Two groups of animals
(n = 12 per group) were pretreated in their home cage
according to administration regime B, and after 21 days of
withdrawal, when they reached adulthood (PND 69–72),
both groups were challenged with saline (5 mL·kg�1, i.p.)
(Day 27) and cocaine (7.5 mg·kg�1 i.p.) (Day 28), and
locomotor activity was registered.

 Cocaine-induced CPP
The cocaine potential to induce approaching behaviours
toward
drug-related
stimuli
was
determined
using
an
unbiased place conditioning paradigm, as described by Soria
et
al.
(2006).
The
apparatus
consisted
of
two
main
conditioning compartments (30 × 29 × 35 cm) connected by
a smaller, central compartment (Cibertec S.A., Madrid,
Spain). The conditioning compartments were disposed with
differences in visual and tactile cues. All the compartments
were equipped with infrared emitter/detector pairs along
the length of the box.
Saline-
and
MDPV-pretreated
animals
according
to
administration regime B (n = 16 per group) were subjected
to the CPP procedure after a 21 day long drug-free period.
During
the
preconditioning
phase
(day
28),
initial
unconditioned preference for the stimulus alternatives was
determined. In this test, mice were placed in the central
compartment and had free access to both compartments of
the
apparatus
for
18
min.
During
the
conditioning
phase (days 29–34), mice received an i.p. injection of cocaine
10 mg·kg�1 immediately before being placed into one of the
two conditioning compartments for 20 min on days 29, 31
and 33. On the alternate days (30, 32 and 35), mice were
placed in the other compartment for 20 min after being given
a saline injection. Treatments were counterbalanced as much
as possible between compartments. Control animals received
saline every day. The preference test was conducted exactly as
the preconditioning phase. A CPP score was calculated for
each subject as the difference between times spent in the
drug-paired and the saline-paired compartments during the
pre-conditioning and the preference tests.
Cocaine operant SA
Acquisition of cocaine SA.
The SA experiments were carried
out in eight mouse operant chambers (Model ENV-307A-CT,
Med
Associates,
Inc.
Cibertec
S.A.,
Madrid,
Spain),
as
previously described by Soria et al. (2006). Saline- and
MDPV-pretreated mice according to administration regime
B (n = 16 per group) were trained for 2 h·day�1 to nosepokes
in order to receive 1 mg·kg�1 cocaine infusions on 10
consecutive days under a fixed ratio 1 (FR1).
Surgical implantation of the catheter into the jugular
vein was performed following anaesthesia with a mixture
of ketamine (100 mg·mL�1) and xylazine (20 mg·kg�1).
The anaesthetic solution was injected in a volume of
0.15 mL·10 g�1, i.p. (Soria et al., 2006; Tourino et al., 2012).
Mice were housed individually and allowed to recover for at
least 3 days. During recovery, mice were treated daily with
an analgesic (meloxicam 0.5 mg·kg�1, injected in a volume
of
0.1
mL·10
g�1,
i.p.)
and
an
antibiotic
solution
(enrofloxacin
7.5
mg·kg�1,
injected
in
a
volume
of
0.03 mL·10 g�1, i.p.). The home cages were placed upon
thermal blankets to avoid post-anaesthesia hypothermia.
SA procedures started 21 days after the last day of
administration regime B (Day 28). Active and inactive
nosepokes were assigned randomly. Cocaine was delivered
in a 20 μL injection for 2 s via a syringe mounted on a
microinfusion pump (PHM-100A, Med-Associates, Georgia,
VT, USA) connected to single-channel liquid swivel (375/25,
Instech Lab, Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA) and the mouse’s
intravenous catheter. All FR1 sessions started with a cocaine
priming infusion. When mice responded on the active hole,
the stimulus lights (one located inside the nosepoke and the
other above it) lit up for 4 s and a cocaine infusion was
delivered automatically. Each infusion was followed by a
30 s time-out period in which a nosepoke on the active hole
had no consequences. Mice were considered to have acquired
stable SA behaviour when the following criteria were met in
two
consecutive
FR1
sessions:
(a)
80%
stability
in
reinforcements (the number of reinforces in each day
deviated by <20% from the mean number of reinforces in
two consecutive days); (b) ≥ 65% of responses were received
at the active hole; and (c) a minimum of five responses in
the active hole. After 10 days of training (Day 38), mice that
achieved the acquisition criteria (n = 9 per group) were moved
to a progressive ratio (PR) session. In the PR session (2 h), the
response
requirement
to
earn
an
injection
escalated
throughout the following series: 1–2–3–5–12–18–27–40–
60–90–135–200–300–450–675–1000.
Extinction and reinstatement.
All the animals that reached
the acquisition criteria were subjected to an extinction
phase. The extinction procedure was adapted from Soria
et al. (2008). Nosepokes in the active hole produced neither
cocaine infusion nor stimulus light presentation. Extinction
sessions (2 h) were conducted once a day, 5 days·week�1
until reaching the extinction criteria. These criteria were
achieved when mice made a mean number of responses in
two consecutive extinction sessions of less than 40% of the
responses performed during the last day of the cocaine-
training
phase.
Twenty-four
hours
after
achieving
the
extinction
criteria,
mice
underwent
a
cocaine-primed
reinstatement session, as previously described (Soria et al.,
2008). In order to recover the extinguished cocaine-seeking
behaviour, saline- and MDPV-pretreated mice (n = 9 per
group) were confined to the operant chambers for 2 h
immediately after receiving an i.p. injection of cocaine
10 mg·kg�1. Nosepokes had no consequences in any of the
holes.
Tissue sample preparations
Mice pretreated according to the administration regime B
were killed by cervical dislocation 24 h after the treatment
(Day 8) or after saline/cocaine challenge (Day 28) for the
analysis of ΔFosB expression and D2 receptor density or 2 h
after saline/cocaine challenge for the determination of c-Fos
expression. The inclusion of a saline challenge group allowed
us to study also the long-term effects of MDPV treatment.
Ventral (including NAcc), dorsal or the whole striatum, when
appropriate, were quickly dissected out and stored at �80°C
until use.
Tissue samples for Western blot analysis were processed as
described (Pubill et al., 2013), with minor modifications.
Briefly, for nuclear c-Fos Western blot analysis, dorsal
striatum tissue samples were homogenized at 4°C in 400 μL
of buffer (5 mM Tris–HCl, 320 mM sucrose) with the protease
inhibitor cocktail. The homogenates were centrifuged at
1000 × g for 15 min at 4°C, and the pellets were resuspended
in buffer (Tris–HCl 50 mM) with the protease inhibitor
cocktail.

 For ΔFosB Western blot analysis, ventral striatum tissue
samples were thawed and homogenized at 4°C in 20 volumes
of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, pH = 8, 1% NP40, 137 mM
NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mM EDTA) with the protease inhibitor
cocktail. The homogenates were shaken and rolled for
120 min at 4°C and centrifuged at 15 000 × g for 30 min at
4°C. Aliquots of resulting supernatants (total lysate) were
stored at �80°C until use.
For
[3H]raclopride
binding
assays,
crude
membrane
preparation from the whole striatum was prepared as
described by Martínez-Clemente et al., (2012). Briefly, tissue
samples were thawed and homogenized at 4°C in 20 volumes
of buffer (5 mM Tris–HCl, 320 mM sucrose) with the protease
inhibitor cocktail. The homogenates were centrifuged at
15000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The pellets were resuspended
in buffer and incubated at 37°C for 5 min to remove
endogenous neurotransmitters. The protein samples were
recentrifuged, and the final pellets were resuspended in the
appropriate buffer and stored at �80°C until use. Protein
content was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Reagent
(BioRad, Inc., Madrid, Spain).
W
estern blotting and immunodetection
ΔFosB and c-Fos Western blot analyses were performed as
described by Buenrostro-Jáuregui et al. (2016) with minor
modifications. Briefly, for each sample, 10 or 20 μg of protein
was mixed with loading buffer [0.5 M Tris–HCl, pH = 6.8, 10%
glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 5% (v/v) 2-β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05%
bromophenol blue], boiled for 5 min and loaded onto a 10%
acrylamide gel. Proteins were then transferred to PVDF sheets
(Immobilion-P, Millipore). PVDF membranes were blocked
for 1 h at room temperature with 5% defatted milk in
Tris-buffer plus 0.05% Tween-20 and incubated overnight at
4°C with mouse primary antibody anti-FosB (1:250) or rabbit
primary
antibody
anti-c-Fos
(1:200).
After
washing,
membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with
a peroxidase-conjugated (1:2500) antimouse or antirabbit
(1:2000)
IgG
antibody.
Immunoreactive
protein
was
visualized using a chemoluminescence-based detection kit
(Immobilion Western, Millipore) and a BioRad ChemiDoc
XRS
gel
documentation
system
(BioRad,
Inc.,
Madrid,
Spain). Scanned blots were analysed using BioRad Image
Software, and dot densities were expressed as a proportion
of those taken from control. As a control for load, β-tubulin
(1:2500) or GAPDH (1:5000) antibody was used.
D2 receptor density
The density of D2 receptors in striatal membranes was
measured by [3H]raclopride binding assays as described
(Martínez-Clemente et al., 2014). Assays were performed in
tubes
containing
2
nM
[3H]raclopride
and
50
μg
of
membranes. Incubation was carried out at 25°C for 1 h in a
Tris–HCl buffer. Sulpiride (300 μM) was used to determine
non-specific binding. The incubation was ended by rapid
filtration under vacuum through Whatman GF/B glass fibre
filters. The radioactivity in the filters was measured by liquid
scintillation spectrometry.
Data acquisition and statistical analysis
The data and statistical analysis in this study comply with the
recommendations on experimental design and analysis in
pharmacology (Curtis et al., 2015). Data were expressed as
mean
±
SEM.
Data
from
biochemical
analyses
were
normalized with 100% defined as the mean of the technical
replicates in the control group, and the SEM was normalized
appropriately.
Animals
were
randomly
assigned
to
an
experimental group. During the behavioural manipulations,
researchers were not aware of the pretreatment that each
animal had received.
Differences between groups were compared using two-
way ANOVA or Student’s t-test for independent samples
where appropriate. The α error probability was set at 0.05.
Significant differences (P < 0.05) were analysed using the
Tukey’s post hoc test for multiple comparison measures
(InVivoStat
software
package)
only
if
F
achieved
the
necessary level of statistical significance (P < 0.05) and no
significant variance inhomogeneity was observed. The exact
group size for the individual experiments is shown in the
corresponding figure legends. To analyse the acquisition of
cocaine SA during the 10 day training, extinction of the
operant behaviour and reinstatement, a three-way ANOVA
was calculated, with nosepoke (active or inactive), treatment
with MDPV or saline, and day (or session) as factors of
variation. Subsequent Tukey’s post hoc tests were calculated
when required. Breaking point achieved at the end of the PR
sessions
was
analysed
using
the
non-parametric
Mann–Whitney U-test.
Materials
Pure racemic MDPV·HCl was synthesized and characterized in
our laboratory as described (Novellas et al., 2015). Cocaine was
provided by the Spanish National Institute of Toxicology.
MDPV and cocaine solutions for injection were prepared in
0.9%
NaCl
(saline,
pH
=
7.4)
immediately
before
administration. Mouse monoclonal ΔFosB antibody and the
protease inhibitor cocktail were purchased from Abcam
(Cambridge, UK) and rabbit polyclonal c-Fos antibody from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). [3H]
raclopride was obtained from Perkin Elmer Life Sci. (Boston,
MA, USA). Ketamine was from Rhône Merieux (Lyon,
France). Xylazine, sulpiride and all buffer reagents (analytical
grade) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).
Results
Sensitization to the hyperlocomotor responses
induced by repeated cocaine administration
To evaluate the behavioural sensitization to cocaine 5 days
after MDPV pretreatment (regime A), we assessed the hyper-
locomotion induced by repeated cocaine administration
(Figure 2). During the treatment phase (Figure 2 inset),
cocaine induced an acute hyperlocomotion that increased
with repeated daily exposure. Two-way ANOVA revealed
effect of the day (F4,76 = 8.791) and the pretreatment factor
(F1,19 = 6.025,) without interaction between factors.
When analysing the differences between the first day of
the treatment (Day 8) and the cocaine challenge (Day 19)
(Figure 2), two-way ANOVA also demonstrated a significant
effect of the day (F1,19 = 9.909) and the pretreatment factor
(F1,19 = 9.504) without the interaction between pretreatment
and day.
Early exposure to MDPV enhances cocaine effects

 Interestingly, mice pretreated with MDPV showed a
significant increase in the hyperlocomotor activity induced
by cocaine on both, the first day of cocaine administration
(Day 8) and the challenge day (Day 19) compared with
saline-pretreated
mice.
Overall,
these
results
indicate
that pre-exposure to MDPV is able to enhance the response
to cocaine, without affecting the acquisition of sensitization.
Cocaine-induced HLA
The HLA was monitored for 15 min after a single saline
(5 mg·kg�1) or cocaine (7.5 mg·kg�1) i.p. injection to mice
previously pretreated with saline or MDPV according to
administration regime B (Figure 3). This dose of cocaine
elicited a significant psychostimulant effect on saline- and
MDPV-pretreated
animals,
although
a
higher
hyper-
locomotor response was observed in the group pretreated
with
the
psychostimulant.
Two-way
ANOVA
revealed
significant effect of the cocaine challenge (F1,44 = 53.60) and
interaction between challenge and pretreatment (F1,44 = 4.58),
but no effect of the pretreatment factor was found. This means
that
MDPV
pretreatment, by
itself, is
not
capable
of
increasing locomotor activity when mice are challenged with
saline, but only after challenge with cocaine.
Cocaine-induced CPP
As shown in Figure 4A, saline- and MDPV-pretreated mice
(regime
B)
presented
no
preference
for
any
of
the
compartments (Figure 4A). Only one animal from the
saline-pretreated group was withdrawn from the study due
to an initial preference for one of the compartments (>65%
of the total session time spent in one compartment). The
repeated
administration
of
cocaine
(10
mg·kg�1,
i.p.)
produced a preference for the cocaine-paired compartment
(Figure 4B). Two-way ANOVA demonstrated a significant
effect of the pretreatment factor (F1,58 = 15.0), treatment effect
(F1,58
=
114.4)
and
interaction
between
treatment
and
pretreatment (F1,58 = 7.075). Accordingly, MDPV-pretreated
mice showed
an
increased
expression
of
the
cocaine-
induced CPP compared with the saline-pretreated group
(Figure 4B).

 Self-administration reinforced with cocaine
Acquisition
of
cocaine
SA.
The
effect
of
the
MDPV
pretreatment (regime B) on the reinforcing properties of
cocaine was evaluated in the SA procedure. First, both
saline- and MDPV-pretreated mice were trained to self-
administer cocaine (1 mg·kg�1 per infusion) during 10 days
under
a
FR1
schedule
of
reinforcement.
The
criteria
acquisition rates were equal for both groups: 56%. All the
statistical analyses and data representations were performed
only with mice that acquired the learning criteria. Three-
way ANOVA (pretreatment × day of training × nosepoke) of
infusions on both nosepokes given along the FR1 sessions
yielded no significant effects of the pretreatment factor
(F1,9 = 0.56) (Figure 5A), thus indicating a lack of effect of
MDPV pretreatment on the acquisition of cocaine SA
behaviour. The operant procedure produced the acquisition
of cocaine SA as revealed by the day of training factor
(F9,9 = 2.138). Animals were able to discriminate between
active and inactive nosepokes as indicated by the nosepoke
factor (F1,9 = 108.8). An interaction between day of training
and nosepoke factors was also found (F9,9 = 4.45). No other
interactions were found. A significant effect of MDPV
pretreatment was revealed in the breaking point achieved
on the PR session (Mann–Whitney U = 15.5) (Figure 5B),
indicating that MDPV pretreatment increased the value of
cocaine as reinforcer.
Extinction
and
cocaine-primed
reinstatement.
Three-way
ANOVA (pretreatment × extinction day × nosepokes) showed
that groups extinguished cocaine SA behaviour among the
extinction sessions, as the factor extinction day had a
significant effect (F11,11 = 14.78) (Figure 6A). However, the
factor
pretreatment
had
no
significant
influence
over
nosepokes
along the extinction phase (F1,11 =
0.057).
Animals
were
able
to
discriminate
between
nosepokes
(F1,11 = 284.6), but as the interaction between this factor
and pretreatment revealed (F1,11 = 16), both groups stopped
discriminating
between
nosepokes
in
different
days.
Subsequent
post
hoc
analyses
indicated
that
MDPV-
pretreated animals discriminated between nosepokes until

(Tukey),
whereas

 between extinction day and nosepokes (F11,11 = 7645) was
found. No other interactions were found.
After extinction of cocaine SA, mice that acquired
the extinction criteria were submitted to a cocaine-primed
(10 mg·kg�1), drug-inducedreinstatementsession(Figure 6B).
Three-way ANOVA (pretreatment × session × nosepokes) showed
a significant effect of day (F3,3 = 8.263) and nosepokes
(F1,3 = 116.9), without pretreatment effect (F1,3 = 0.477).
Significant
interactions
were
found
between
days
and
nosepokes (F3,3 = 6.128), and pretreatment and nosepokes
(F1,3 = 3.979). Post hoc analyses indicated that both groups
of pretreatments did not differ in the number of active
nosepokes in the reinstatement session. However, MDPV-
pretreated
mice,
unlike
SAL-pretreated,
reinstated
their
previously extinguished cocaine-SA behaviour after being
drug-primed (cocaine 10 mg·kg�1). Therefore, SAL-pretreated
mice did not reinstate previous extinguished cocaine-SA
behaviour
(Tukey).
Interestingly,
MDPV-pretreated
mice
achieved a significant difference between active nosepokes
in reinstatement session versus the last day of extinction
(Tukey) (Figure 6B).
c-Fos and ΔFosB expression
Because we had seen that the pretreatment with MDPV
modified the response to cocaine, we wanted to determine
how the MDPV pretreatment influenced the expression of
certain factors that are known to be associated with the
effects of cocaine, such as c-Fos and ΔFosB. Expression of
the transcription factor ΔFosB in the brain also controls the
responsiveness
of
an
animal
to
the
rewarding
and
locomotor-activating effects of cocaine. Following regime B,
we investigated the expression of ΔFosB 24 h after saline or
MDPV pretreatment (Day 8) (Figure 7A) and after saline or
cocaine challenge (Day 29) (Figure 7B) and also c-Fos 2 h after
saline or cocaine challenge (Day 28) (Figure 7C).
As shown in Figure 7A, mice pretreated with MDPV
(regime B) showed a significant increase of ΔFosB expression,
by 300% compared with saline-treated mice, when measured
24 h after finishing the treatment. At day 29, 24 h after
receiving the saline/cocaine challenge, the statistical analysis
showed
a
significant
effect
of
the
pretreatment
factor
(F1,18 = 5.976; Figure 7B). Therefore and although the high
ΔFosB expression declined during withdrawal, this factor still
remained apparently elevated (132% animals pretreated with
MDPV and challenged with saline). In addition, cocaine
challenge also produced an increase in ΔFosB expression
compared with saline injection (F1,18 = 4.699).
The c-Fos expression has been used as a marker for
neuronal activity. In this context, two-way ANOVA revealed
effect of the challenge factor (F1,18 = 54.21; Figure 7C). Cocaine
induced a significant increase in c-Fos expression in both
groups, saline- and MDPV-pretreated mice (320% and 220%
respectively). Accordingly, statistical analysis also disclosed
the effect of the pretreatment factor (F1,18 = 8.497). Thus, MDPV

 pretreatment reduces the cocaine-induced expression of this
marker. Moreover, after saline challenge, MDPV-pretreated
mice showed a decrease (52%) in c-Fos expression compared
with SAL-pretreated mice, although such differences did not
reach statistical significance. Therefore, it seemed that, at
the same time when ΔFosB was increasing, c-Fos expression
was reduced.
D2 receptor density
To determine the involvement of striatal dopamine D2
receptors, we measured [3H]raclopride binding in this brain
area 24 h after treatment (Figure 8A) or saline and cocaine
challenge
(Figure
8B).
Twenty-four
hours
after
MDPV
pretreatment, the D2 receptor density was significantly
decreased (t18 = 2.613). However, 24 h after saline or cocaine
challenge, two-way ANOVA only revealed differences of the
challenge factor (F1,30 = 4.179). However, post hoc analysis did
not demonstrate statistical significance.
Discussion
Cocaine abuse represents a heavy burden of disease in many
countries and has become a global problem. Any factor that
increases the vulnerability to cocaine abuse must be carefully
evaluated. In the present study, we demonstrate that MDPV
enhances the responsiveness to cocaine in all tested aspects.
In a first study (regime A), we investigated the influence of
a
short-term
MDPV
exposure
on
the
behavioural
sensitization induced by cocaine. MDPV produced a gradual
increase of cocaine hyperlocomotor effects and a high

 reactivity to a cocaine challenge after 7 days of cocaine
withdrawal. However, mice exposed to MDPV showed a
higher
response
to
cocaine
when
they
received
this
psychostimulant for the first time, and this increased
hyperlocomotor effect was maintained throughout all the
sensitization procedure.
In a second set of experiments, we carried out a repeated
treatment (regime B) with a moderate dose of MDPV, in
adolescent mice, and we investigated the influence on the
acute effects of cocaine on adulthood, including motor
responses, rewarding effects on the CPP, and the cocaine-
induced reinforcing effects on the SA paradigm.
We found that mice exposed to MDPV were more reactive
to cocaine but not to saline injection. So this observed
response was independent of the environmental context
because
MDPV
treatment
was
administered
in
the
home cages. Accordingly, an MDPV treatment with low doses
(0.3 or 0.5 mg·kg�1) during 5–7 days increased responsiveness
to acute cocaine (5–10 mg·kg�1) after a 10–11 days drug-free
period (Berquist et al., 2016; Buenrostro-Jáuregui et al., 2016).
We also sought to find out if MDPV exposure resulted in
increased
responsiveness
to
cocaine
in
reward
and
reinforcing effects on mice. Our results revealed that repeated
administration of MDPV in adolescent mice led to a long-
term increase of cocaine-induced behavioural adaptations,
related to its abuse potential, when tested into adulthood in
the CPP. This paradigm is used to reflect the degree by which
drugs of abuse establish approaching behaviours toward
drug-related stimuli (Bardo and Bevins, 2000). The observed
increase in the robustness of the conditioned responses in
the CPP expression seems to reflect an increase in the abuse
liability of cocaine after exposure to MDPV. Thus, our
findings
demonstrate
that
MDPV
exposure
during
adolescence can effectively potentiate cocaine abuse liability
in adulthood by sensitizing the neural circuitry underlying
associations between cocaine and its related stimuli. To
our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluates the
long-term effects of MDPV treatment on cocaine-induced
CPP. However, similar effects of MDPV pretreatment
on
the
development
of
psychostimulants-induced
reinforcing effects have been recently reported. For instance,
MDPV (1.8 mg·kg�1 during 5 days) attenuated the taste
avoidance induced by cocaine (18 mg·kg�1), but not those
induced by LiCl, in rats (Woloshchuk et al., 2016). As
mentioned
above,
MDPV
also
sensitized
to
cocaine
locomotor response after a drug washout period (Berquist
et al., 2016; Buenrostro-Jáuregui et al., 2016). Moreover, an
intermittent repeated exposure to MDPV (1 mg·kg�1 during
5
days)
produced
sensitization
to
methamphetamine
challenge (0.5 mg·kg�1) in rats (Watterson et al., 2016).
Nevertheless, no study has yet evaluated global MDPV effects
on
cocaine-induced
abuse
liability
and,
in
particular,
evaluated its effects on cocaine-induced reinforcing effects
on the SA paradigm, as we present in the present study. In
fact, mice repeatedly exposed to MDPV during adolescence
made greater efforts to obtain a cocaine infusion in a PR
schedule of reinforcement when tested in adulthood. The
PR schedule of reinforcement requires behaviours specially
linked
to
motivational
functions,
such
as
instrumental
learning,
execution
of
efforts
and
sustained
engagement
(Randall et al., 2012). The lack of difference between mice
exposed to MDPV or to saline during the acquisition phase
of SA could be attributed to the fact that this phase was
performed under an FR1 schedule of reinforcement that
seems not to be appropriate to determine the reinforcement
efficiency (Richardson and Roberts, 1996). In this sense, it is
a common feature of rodent cocaine SA studies to find a
certain degree of inconsistency between results on FR1, PR
schedules
and
reinstatement
sessions
depending
on
the
experimental
conditions
(Homberg
et
al.,
2002;
Morgan
et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2005; España et al., 2011).
In addition, MDPV-pretreated mice delayed extinction
after acquisition of the operant behaviour to cocaine and
reinstated after a cocaine priming injection. Reinstatement
of SA behaviour reflects the reinforcing properties of drugs
and its pharmacological manipulations (Shaham et al.,
2003; Soria et al., 2008; Bossert et al., 2013). We have also
found a drug-seeking reinstatement behaviour in mice
previously exposed to MDPV, suggesting a higher level of
craving than in control mice. Thus, we suggest that MDPV
exposure during adolescence will strengthen the efforts to
obtain cocaine in adulthood, and this effect leads to an
enhanced vulnerability to reinstate cocaine SA behaviour
once extinguished.
These
results
lead
us
to
hypothesize
that
MDPV
administration
induces
long-lasting
adaptive
changes,
leading to a greater response to cocaine. ΔFosB, c-Fos and D2
receptors are factors involved in the acute and long-lasting
effects of cocaine (Larson et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2013). For
instance,
studies
performed
using
positron
emission
topography have consistently shown that drug abuse is
accompanied by a decrease in striatal D2 receptor availability.
Furthermore, studies in drug-naïve, non-human primates
suggest that D2 receptor availability is predictive of drug-
seeking behaviour (Nader et al., 2006). In the present study,
we have found that repeated MDPV exposure was associated
with a decreased striatal density of D2 receptors, probably
reflecting a neuroadaptive effect in response to MDPV
dopaminergic stimulation, but this effect is only transient as
it did not remain after 21 days of withdrawal, when D2
receptor population was observed to return to initial values.
Additionally, we determined D2 receptor levels after the
challenge of cocaine. As expected, an acute dose of this drug
modulated D2 receptors, although without influence of
MDPV pre-exposure.
There is growing evidence for an important role of ΔFosB
in animal models of drug addiction (Nestler, 2008). The Fos
family of proteins is rapidly and transiently induced in the
striatum after acute administration of several drugs of abuse
(Graybiel et al., 1990; Hope et al., 1992; Young et al., 1991).
Although most of them are highly unstable, ΔFosB is
progressively accumulated after repeated drug exposure. This
accumulation has been linked to cocaine-induced reward,
locomotor sensitization and SA behaviour (Colby et al.,
2003; Kelz et al., 1999; McClung et al., 2004), which together
suggest a role in the neural mechanisms involved in
transitioning
between
recreational
use
and
abuse
phenomenon. In the present study, an increased expression
of ΔFosB was found 24 h after the end of the MDPV exposure
and levels of this factor remained raised throughout the
period of abstinence. Therefore, it is reasonable to propose
that the increased level of this transcription factor responded

 to MDPV treatment, leading to an increased responsiveness
to cocaine effects. Changes in ΔFosB seem to extend the
regulation
of
drug
sensitivity
toward
more
complex
behaviours (Colby et al., 2003). Thus, according to our
findings, mice overexpressing ΔFosB work harder to self-
administer cocaine in PR schedule of reinforcement in SA
assays, suggesting that ΔFosB may sensitize animals to the
incentive motivational properties of cocaine and thereby
leading to a propensity for relapse after drug withdrawal.
Numerous putative targets for ΔFosB have been identified
in brain, and some of these target genes have been related to
the cellular and behavioural effects of this transcription
factor (McClung et al., 2004). One of these target genes is
c-Fos. Induction of c-Fos protein is considered an early marker
of neural activation, and it is also important for behavioural
responses to cocaine (Zhang et al., 2006). This factor
is
markedly
activated
by
acute
administration
of
psychostimulants, but only weakly after repeated exposure
(Hope et al., 1992; Persico et al., 1993), when levels of ΔFosB
are high. In this sense, Renthal et al. (2008) demonstrated
that ΔFosB mediates epigenetic desensitization of the c-Fos
gene after chronic exposure to a psychostimulant. In our
study, a significant increase of c-Fos expression appeared a
short time after cocaine challenge that undoubtedly reflects
neuronal activation by the drug. However, this protein
expression was related to MDPV pretreatment. Thus, levels
of c-Fos seemed to be inversely associated with MDPV
pretreatment, when ΔFosB is significantly expressed. Results
demonstrate a negative association between both factors, in
accordance with the findings of Renthal et al., (2008).
In summary, MDPV increased most of the behavioural
responses related to cocaine effects, including locomotor
sensitization, reward and the strength of cocaine as reinforcer
in a SA procedure. It is noteworthy that MDPV increased
capability
to
reinstate
cocaine
SA
behaviour
once
extinguished, presumably indicating increased craving, after
MDPV exposure during adolescence. These behavioural
alterations were associated with an accumulation of ΔFosB,
a sustained molecular switch for cocaine addiction, providing
a possible mechanism by which molecular changes induced
by MDPV can persist for weeks after withdrawal and
supporting the deleterious effects of MDPV on cocaine abuse
liability. Therefore, these results suggest that consumption of
MDPV during adolescence induces long-lasting adaptive
changes leading to a higher response to cocaine in the
adulthood, predisposing to a higher vulnerability to abuse
of this drug. From a clinical point of view, this feature
represents a basic step to provide new knowledge about
factors involved in the vulnerability to cocaine addiction.
