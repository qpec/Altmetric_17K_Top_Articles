ABSTRACT
Objectives: To investigate mortality and its causes in
adults over the age of 20 years with intellectual
disability (ID).
Design, setting and participants: Retrospective
population-based standardised mortality of the ID and
Comparison cohorts. The ID cohort comprised 42 204
individuals who registered for disability services with
ID as a primary or secondary diagnosis from 2005 to
2011 in New South Wales (NSW). The Comparison
cohort was obtained from published deaths in NSW
from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) from
2005 to 2011.
Main outcome measures: We measured and
compared Age Standardised Mortality Rate (ASMR),
Comparative Mortality Figure (CMF), years of
productive life lost (YPLL) and proportion of deaths
with potentially avoidable causes in an ID cohort with
an NSW general population cohort.
Results: There were 19 362 adults in the ID cohort
which experienced 732 (4%) deaths at a median age of
54 years. Age Standardised Mortality Rates increased
with age for both cohorts. Overall comparative
mortality figure was 1.3, but was substantially higher
for the 20–44 (4.0) and 45–64 (2.3) age groups. YPLL
was 137/1000 people in the ID cohort and 49 in the
comparison cohort. Cause of death in ID cohort was
dominated by respiratory, circulatory, neoplasm and
nervous system. After recoding deaths previously
attributed to the aetiology of the disability, 38% of
deaths in the ID cohort and 17% in the comparison
cohort were potentially avoidable.
Conclusions: Adults with ID experience premature
mortality and over-representation of potentially avoidable
deaths. A national system of reporting of deaths in adults
with ID is required. Inclusion in health policy and
services development and in health promotion
programmes is urgently required to address premature
deaths and health inequalities for adults with ID.
INTRODUCTION
Approximately 1.8% of the Australian popu-
lation have an intellectual disability (ID).1
Compared
with
the
general
population,
people with ID experience very poor mental
and physical health status and substantial
barriers to accessing quality health services.2
People with ID experience high rates of
common disorders with known associations
with mortality, including mental disorders,
respiratory
disorders,
gastro-oesophageal
reflux disease, epilepsy and obesity.3–6 Poor
access to health services and an under-skilled
medical workforce amplifies the potential for
poor outcomes in this population group.
International research has demonstrated
higher mortality rates in people with ID com-
pared to the general population.7–9 Although
life expectancy has increased over time,8 10–12
premature death remains a feature for people
with ID.4 7 9–15 Only limited examination of
death in people with ID has been performed
in Australia. Using a comprehensive service
system database, Bittles et al4 examined life
expectancy of people with ID, finding sub-
stantially reduced life expectancy and a nega-
tive association with severity of ID. However,
there was no detailed examination of cause of
Strengths and limitations of this study
▪ This study provides death statistics and details of
potentially avoidable deaths in adults with intel-
lectual disability (ID) who received disability ser-
vices in New South Wales.
▪ The study provides evidence of mortality gaps in
people with ID compared with the general
population.
▪ The high proportion of potentially avoidable
deaths for people with ID indicates an opportun-
ity for the development of possible preventative
strategies.
▪ Since the ID cohort is derived from registered
users of disability services, people with mild ID
may be under-represented
▪ These findings are not generalisable to everyone
with ID.

 death. A small population-based study of 40 deaths within
a limited geographical area of New South Wales13 yielded
a Standardised Mortality Ratio (SMR) of 4.9, and a pre-
dominance of deaths due to respiratory (35%), external
(20%), cancer (17.5%) and heart disease (15%). The
size of the study and the large number of deaths in
people with more severe levels of disability limit the gen-
eralisability of these findings. The NSW Ombudsman
reports on deaths in NSW disability accommodation ser-
vices.16 17 Although not representative of people with ID
as a whole, this investigation highlights the value of close
scrutiny of deaths data in vulnerable populations as it has
identified preventable causes of death which have been
the catalyst for improvements in policy and practice.16
However, the lack of routine collection and reporting of
health outcomes and mortality data for people with ID is
at odds with Australia’s commitment under the United
Nations Convention on the rights of persons with disabil-
ities (UNCRPD).18
Some deaths are expected, particularly early in life in
individuals with syndromal causes of ID associated with
life-limiting medical conditions.13 However, this effect is
minimised by accessing a broad range of disability
service users of adult age. Comorbidity of ID with spe-
cific
health
conditions,
poor access to
appropriate
healthcare, presence of excess cardiometabolic
risk
factors, polypharmacy, lifestyle choices, socioeconomic
disadvantage and lack of self-advocacy and capacity to
attend to one’s health needs are likely to play a role in
deaths of adults with ID.8 10 19 20 However, the specific
impact of many of these factors on mortality in this
group awaits determination.
The NSW Department of Family and Community
Services, Ageing Disability and Home Care collects a
Disability Services Minimum Data Set (DS-MDS) related
to all people with disability who are registered to receive
funded disability services in NSW. This data set includes
a large population of individuals who have ID as defined
strictly in accordance with Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual Fourth Edition (DSM IV) criteria. Similarities in
ID services access between Australian states mean that
this population approximates a nationally representative
sample of people with ID who are in receipt of funded
disability services. The linkage of the DS-MDS to mortal-
ity data enables the accurate identification of deaths and
cause of deaths within a cohort of persons with ID
within a defined period.
Previously, for the purposes of comparing death rates
in
NSW
to
international
cohorts,
we
published
age-standardised death rates in people with ID in 5-year
age bands from 5 to 64 years of age21 according to the
WHO standard age distribution.22 Consistent with inter-
national data, we observed an overall comparative mor-
tality ratio of 2.55 in people with ID in NSW across this
wide age range.21 The current study uses data standar-
dised to the Australian population to extend these find-
ings to examine other death indices and causes of
death. We hypothesised that compared to the general
adult population, the adults with ID would experience
higher mortality rates, greater years of productive life
lost (YPLL), different cause of death profiles and a
higher proportion of potentially avoidable deaths.
METHODS
Study populations
We used two distinct population data sets to define the
ID and comparison cohorts. Overall, there were 42 243
registered clients with ID recorded as their primary or
secondary disability within the DS-MDS from July 2005
to June 2012. Of these, 19 362 clients were aged 20 years
and over at 1 July 2005 and were alive at 30 June 2005.
Person years were calculated for each person with ID
from 1 July 2005 and ended at 31 December 2011 or
date of death (whichever occurred first), and these were
grouped in 5-year age-bands (20 to 24, 25 to 29, etc).
The comparison cohort was derived from the published
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data (counts by
5-year age-bands) for the NSW general population from
2005 to 2011.23 Since the observation period for the ID
cohort started from July 2005 (0.5 of a year), we multi-
plied the population counts in the ABS population data
by 0.5 for that year only. Thus, the study spanned the
period July 2005 to December 2011 inclusive. Similar to
the ID cohort, we directly converted the population
counts for the comparison cohort into person years.
Record linkage
To observe mortality for individuals in the ID Cohort,
de-identified linkage of the DS-MDS, and death records
from the ABS and the NSW Registry of Birth Deaths and
Marriages Death Records (RBDM) was performed by
the NSW Centre for Health Record Linkage (CHeReL)
based on a SLK581 Statistical Linkage Key. In accord-
ance with best practice privacy preserving protocols, the
linked unit record data were provided to the researchers
after being stripped of personal identifiers.
Outcome measures
ID cohort: Death events were derived from the NSW
RBDM which records all deaths in NSW. To maximise
our capacity to examine cause of death over the entire
study period, we used two sources of cause of death
information.
ABS
data
with
International
Statistical
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems,
10th Revision (ICD-10) coded causes of death were avail-
able from January 2005 to December 2007 only. The
RBDM free text causes of death data were available from
January 2005 to December 2011. We observed 732
deaths in the ID Cohort in the period from 1 July 2005
to 31 December 2011. Ninety-five (12.9%) of these
deaths did not have a cause of death recorded in either
the ABS or RBDM data sets, leaving 637 cases with cause
of death data. Individuals who did not die or died after
31 December 2011 were assumed to be alive at 31
December 2011.

 To derive coded cause of death data consistent with
ABS conventions for the period for which it was unavail-
able from the ABS ( January 2008 to December 2011),
we used the standardised approach outlined in the
ICD-10 Mortality Manual.24 After ensuring accuracy of
coding by using the 155 cases with both RBDM free text
cause of death and ABS for training purposes, a medical
practitioner then used the RBDM free-text cause of
deaths information to code the cause of death for the
remaining deaths using the ICD-10 approach. Deaths so
coded were pooled with the 155 ABS coded cases and
assigned the term ‘ABS Convention’. This data set com-
prised the underlying cause of death for 637 cases
coded according to ABS conventions, consisting of the
ICD-10 coded cause of death available from ABS from
June 2005 to December 2007 (155 deaths) and derived
from RBDM from January 2008 to December 2011 (482
deaths).
Previous research has identified concerns about over-
shadowing of the true underlying cause of death25 and
about coding errors, where deaths are attributed to the
aetiology of the ID and therefore obscure the true
underlying cause of death26 We therefore developed a
revised underlying cause of death classification for those
individuals for whom the aetiology of their ID had been
coded as the underlying cause of death. To do this, we
recoded the underlying cause of death for these cases to
the cause of death which appeared immediately adjacent
to the coded ID aetiology in reported sequence leading
to death. A total of 102 deaths (49 deaths attributed to
Down syndrome, 29 deaths attributed to cerebral palsy, 9
deaths attributed to other developmental disorders and
4 deaths attributed to chromosomal abnormalities) were
thus ‘ID Revised’.
Potentially avoidable deaths are deaths from condi-
tions that are preventable through individualised care
and/or treatable through existing primary or hospital
care for persons aged under 75 years and which are
avoidable in the context of the present health system.27
We identified potentially avoidable deaths in the ID
population under 75 years of age using underlying
causes of death from both ‘ABS Convention’ and ‘ID
Revised’ data.
Comparison cohort: We obtained NSW mortality infor-
mation for the general population from the ABS website
which publishes the number of deaths by age, for NSW
and other states in Australia.28 29 For causes of death by
age group, we used information from the HealthStats
NSW which publishes deaths for the general population
in NSW by ICD10 category and by sex and age group.
There was a
negligible
discrepancy
between
death
counts obtained from these sources. We adjusted this
published population and mortality data to make it dir-
ectly comparable to our ID cohort. We multiplied the
ABS number of deaths in 2005 by 0.5, for that year only
to align data with the partial year available in the ID
cohort. Health Stats NSW published data in the financial
year format until 2010/2011, and therefore adjustment
for 2005 was unnecessary. However, in order to make the
Health Stats NSW data comparable to the deaths in the
ID cohort for the period July 2010 to December 2011,
we multiplied the number of deaths in the Health Stats
NSW 2010/2011 data by 1.5. We restricted the age of
individuals in the ID cohort to 20 years and over but the
published data from Health Stats NSW had the category
of 15–24 instead of 20–24; hence, we converted the fre-
quency of deaths in the category by multiplying 0.5 for
that age group only. For potentially avoidable deaths in
NSW, yearly numbers of potentially avoidable deaths in
NSW
were
available
from
the
Health
Stats
NSW
website.27 We adjusted the NSW potentially avoidable
deaths data by multiplying the number of potentially
avoidable deaths in 2011/2012 financial year by 0.5 so as
to account for a partial financial year of 2011.
Statistical analysis
Age-specific mortality rates were calculated as numbers
of deaths of the people in each 5-year age-band from
20 years and over in the study period divided by total
person years in that age range in the population. We cal-
culated ASMRs for both the ID and comparison groups
by matching the crude rates to the age profile of a
‘standard Australian population’ as at 30 June 2001,
restricted to the 20 years and over age range and strati-
fied by sex. The Comparative Mortality Figure (CMF)
was calculated by dividing the age-standardised rate for
ID groups by the comparison rate. In addition to the
ASMR for 20 years and over, we also calculated ASMRs
for specific age groups: 20–44 years; 45–64 years and
65 years and over.
The YPLL is an indicator for premature mortality and
is the total number of years not lived by an individual
who died before a prespecified age. To be consistent
with the definition of potentially avoidable deaths, we
considered people who died before 75 years of age as
premature deaths. We calculated YPLL for each 5-year
age band, for each cohort and separately for males and
females. It was derived for each age group by multiply-
ing the number of deaths by the difference between age
75 years and the median age in each age group, and
summing the products obtained from each age group
and dividing total potential years of life lost by the total
population under 75 years of age.
We explored differences in underlying causes of death
by ICD-10 chapter by ranking causes of death in both
cohorts. For the ID cohort, we used our linked mortality
information, while for the comparison cohort we used
published NSW causes of death from Health Stats
NSW.28 We also investigated the proportion of poten-
tially avoidable deaths in the ID cohort and compared it
with the NSW population. All causes of death were pre-
sented according to ICD-10 chapter. Owing to the small
number of potentially avoidable deaths, we did not
perform the direct standardised analysis but chose to
compare the Incident Rate Ratio (IRR) of the poten-
tially avoidable deaths in the comparison and ID cohorts

number: 2013/02/446).
RESULTS
The 19 362 individuals in the ID cohort accumulated
123 934 person years, had a median (IQR) age at July
2005 or at first contact with the service of 37 (27–48)
years, and were predominantly males (10 813 indivi-
duals, 56% of the cohort). There were 732 deaths in
people with ID, representing 4% of the cohort and
equivalent to a crude death rate of 5.9 deaths per 1000
people per year. Of these, 435 (59%) deaths were of
males giving a male to female ratio of deaths of 1.5. The
median (IQR) age at death was 54 (42–64) years, and
there was no significant difference (p=0.193) between
median age at death for males (55 years) and females
(52 years). Seventy-six per cent of deaths in the ID
cohort occurred in people aged 64 years or younger.
The comparison cohort experienced 305 050 deaths and
accumulated
33 624 422
person
years
of
exposure
during the period of July 2005 to December 2011. This
was equivalent to a crude death rate of 9.1 deaths per
1000 person years. In the comparison cohort, the esti-
mated median (IQR) age at death was 81 (70–92) and
the median age at death for males and females was 78
and 84, respectively. Fifty-one per cent of deaths in the
comparison cohort were in males and 18% of death
occurred in people aged 64 years or younger.
Table 1 details ASMRs for each age group with related
CMFs. The ASMR in the whole ID cohort was 7.5 (95%
CI 6.7 to 8.4) and in the comparison cohort was 5.7 (5.6
to 5.7), yielding a CMF of 1.3 (1.2 to 1.5). Higher age-
specific mortality rates were apparent for both males
and females with ID compared to the comparison
cohort; ASMRs for all males and females in the ID
cohort were 12.5 (10.5 to 14.5) and 8.6 (7.2 to 10.0),
respectively, and 9.2 (9.2 to 9.3) and 6.6 (6.5 to 6.6) for
the comparison cohort, respectively. Correspondingly,
CMF for males with ID was 1.4 (1.1 to 1.6) and for
females was 1.3 (1.1 to 1.6). Age-standardised mortality
rates in the ID cohort increased across age bands, but
ASMR differences with the comparison cohort led to
substantial differences in CMFs across age bands. People
with ID in the 20–44 years age category had four times
the death rate of the comparison group CMF: 4.0; 95%
CI 3.1 to 5.2). For people with ID in the age category of
65 years and over, there was no evidence to support
excess deaths above the comparator (CMF: 1.0; 95% CI
0.8 to 1.2) (table 1). Age-specific mortality rates for the

and

cohorts

 The 732 deaths in the ID cohort resulted in 16 468
YPLL, of which 9673 YPLL occurred in males and 6795
in females. This yielded an overall YPLL rate in the ID
cohort of 137 per 1000 people, but the YPLL rate was
higher for males (144) than for females (128) with ID.
The 305 050 deaths in the comparison cohort resulted
in 1 488 636 YPLL, of which 951 455 YPLL occurred in
males and 537 106 in females. The overall YPLL rate in
the comparison cohort was 49 per 1000 people, and the
YPLL rate was higher for males (49) than for females
(35).
Causes of death were available for 637 of 732 deaths
(87%) in the ID cohort and for 304 690 deaths in the com-
parison cohort. Table 2 presents the top 10 underlying
causes of death by ICD-10 chapter, coded using ABS con-
ventions and our revised method and compares these with
the underlying causes of death in the comparison cohort.
Of the 10 leading causes of death in the comparison
cohort, 8 of the leading causes were shared with the ID
cohort, regardless of the coding convention used for the
latter. The dominant causes of death differed between the
ID and comparison cohorts, as reflected in the ranking
and proportion of deaths accounted for by specific ICD-10
chapter categories. Using ABS conventions, diseases of the
circulatory system (18%), malignant neoplasms (18%), dis-
eases of the nervous system (16%), as well as of the respira-
tory system (12%) and congenital malformations (11%),
were the top five underlying causes of death and
accounted for 75% of deaths in the ID cohort. Using the
revised coding method, diseases of the respiratory system
(20%), circulatory system (18%), malignant neoplasms
(18%), diseases of the nervous system (13%) and injury
and poisoning (6%) comprised the top five underlying
causes of death and accounted for 75% of deaths in the
ID cohort. In contrast, the leading five causes of death in
the comparison cohort were diseases of the circulatory
system (35%), malignant neoplasms (29%), diseases of the
respiratory system (9%), injury and poisoning (5%) and
mental and behavioural disorders (5%), which accounted
for 81% of deaths. In an analysis based on ABS conven-
tional coding of causes of death, we determined that the
proportion of deaths from injury and poisoning in our
subgroup of young adults with ID was low for both males
(9%) and females (10%). In contrast, the proportion of
such deaths in our comparison cohort was much higher
and favoured males (52%) over females (35%; table 3).
The top five potentially avoidable deaths in the ID
cohort using ABS conventions and the ‘revised’ coding
of deaths are also presented in table 2. Regardless of the
coding method, circulatory system deaths and infections
were the two leading causes of potentially avoidable
deaths, followed by cancer. Potentially avoidable deaths
using ABS conventions were substantially higher in the
ID cohort (199 of 637, 31% of deaths) compared to the
NSW population (17% of deaths).27

 resulted in an even higher rate (38%) of potentially
avoidable deaths.
Age-specific potentially avoidable death rates for the
ID and comparison cohorts are shown in figure 1 and in
online supplementary table S2. People with ID had
higher age-specific avoidable death rates than the com-
parison group for both ABS Convention and ‘Revised’
coding methods, with the latter being of slightly greater
magnitude. After adjusting for age groups using Poisson
regression, we found that compared to the comparison
cohort, IRR was higher in the ID population using ABS
convention coding (IRR 1.47; 95% CI 1.54 to 1.99;
p<0.001), and even higher when we used the revised
cause of death (IRR 1.77; 95% CI 1.56 to 2.01; p<0.001).
We could not perform the analyses based on sex or
causes as Health Stats NSW only published data of the
potentially avoidable deaths by age groups.
DISCUSSION
This is the largest Australian study, and one of only a
handful of studies worldwide which have investigated
mortality and its causes in a representative sample of
adult disability service users with ID. The experience of
this population is of premature death, relative over-
representation of deaths in young and middle-aged
adults, and deaths from preventable causes.
Markers of premature death for people with ID in this
cohort include predominance (76%) of deaths occurring
prior to the age of 65 years, elevated ASMR (7.5 compared
to 5.7 in the comparison cohort), a CMF of 1.3 and raised
YPLL of 137 per 1000 people compared with 49 in the
comparison cohort. Such figures reflect the stark and con-
tinuing health inequalities experienced by people with ID
in Australia, and the lack of substantial progress in addres-
sing these inequalities since initial publication of mortality
data in Australians with ID more than a decade ago.4 13
Similar to the general population, the overall ASMR
for adult males with ID (12.5) was substantially higher
than for adult females with ID (8.6). However, the
impact of sex on ASMRs differed with age. In young and
middle-aged adults, ASMRs of males and females with
ID approximated one another, whereas in the corre-
sponding age bands of the general population, ASMRs
for males were approximately double those for females.
Relative over-representation of deaths in females with ID
has been previously documented in the international lit-
erature,9

 proposed including vulnerability to death conferred by
specific interaction of sex with hormonal, genetic or
mortality related risk factors, or other factors such as
gender specific lifestyle factors or gender specific diffi-
culty in accessing appropriate preventative healthcare
including
cancer
screening.
Our
results
suggest
a
further possible explanation. It is well known that deaths
from injury and poisoning account for just under half
(45%) of all young adult deaths in the general popula-
tion and that the sex ratio of deaths from these causes
strongly favours deaths in males.30 The low proportion
of injury and poisoning deaths in males and females
with ID compared with the general population suggests
a relative under-representation of deaths in young males
with ID (compared to the general population) as a
driver of observed sex differences, rather than an over-
representation of deaths in young females with ID.
Although the overall CMF for the adult ID cohort was
only 1.3, the CMF in specific age groups revealed a sub-
stantially elevated CMFs of 4.0 in younger adults (20–
44 years),
moderately
elevated
CMF
of
2.3
for
middle-aged (45–64 years) adults and a CMF of 1.0 in
older adults (65 years and over) with ID. Elevated CMFs
in early adulthood may be driven by continuing effects
from complex physical comorbidities associated with the
aetiology of ID, whereas midlife mortality in people with
ID most likely represents the impacts of premature
age-related morbidities. A healthy survivor effect could
explain the lack of over-representation of deaths in the
elderly with ID. Future detailed analysis of cause of
death profiles in different age groups will assist in dee-
pening the understanding of the differential mortality
rates at different life stages in people with ID.
Although there are similarities in the top 10 causes
of death in people with and without ID, the propor-
tions of deaths explained by specific cause of death
differ between the groups. Compared to people without
ID, people with ID have an over-representation of
deaths
related
to
diseases
of
the
respiratory
and
nervous systems, as well as those of congenital and
chromosomal origins and an under-representation of
deaths due to age-dependent causes such as diseases of
the circulatory system and neoplasms. Using the revised
underlying cause of death coding, the order but not
the composition of the top five underlying causes of
death was changed, reflecting an emphasis on diseases
of the respiratory and circulatory systems which was
obscured by coding of the disability aetiology as the
cause of death. Respiratory deaths are likely to be
reflective of greater vulnerability to respiratory infec-
tions, including those that arise from feeding and swal-
lowing difficulties.17 Deaths attributed to nervous system
causes include those related to epilepsy, which is known
to be over-represented in people with ID31 and in
whom there may be an increased risk of sudden
death.32
People with ID had much higher proportions of poten-
tially avoidable deaths than people without ID. Potentially
avoidable deaths in people with ID were dominated by
deaths due to infections, diseases of the circulatory
system, cancer and other external causes. The predicted
ageing of the ID population with ID will most likely see
increases in circulatory and neoplasm-related deaths
unless specific preventative health strategies are imple-
mented. Particularly stark is the large proportion of
potentially avoidable deaths due to infections. Such
deaths suggest that people with ID experience delays, dif-
ficulties or differences in accessing specific and effective
interventions for infections. Medical assistance must be
sought assertively in individuals who manifest symptoms,
but this is made difficult as patients with ID may not
readily report symptoms, and some providing direct care
lack skills in early identification of relevant physical signs.
Primary care providers should consider careful assess-
ment, proactive treatment and close monitoring of pro-
gress if there are infections in this population.
Comprehensive strategies to mitigate risk of death due
to respiratory causes have been recommended by the
NSW Ombudsman.16 17 Although some improvement to
practice within disability services has been achieved,
further work is required to ensure a systemic and inter-
agency response to this issue, both within disability and
health sectors. Critically, awareness raising and the
implementation of specific education and targeted inter-
ventions in primary and specialist care settings are
required. The implementation of the National Disability
Insurance Scheme (NDIS) will bring increased choice
and control for people with ID and their families. It is
critical that the need for feeding and swallowing assess-
ments, and awareness of vulnerability to infections and
respiratory conditions are recognised, and that services
are readily accessed and appropriately prioritised by
people with ID and their carers under the NDIS.
This study has a number of implications for policy,
practice and administration. Foremost, these data high-
light the substantial and continuing health inequalities
experienced by people with ID. In view of Australia’s
commitment to the UNCRPD,18 Australian governments
are urged to focus attention on this population of need,
and develop comprehensive responses which address the
inadequacies of health policy, services and services access
for this population. Strategies should be paired with
regular reporting of health status and outcomes for
people with ID, as occurs in other jurisdictions such as
the UK. At the coal face, doctors should be equipped,
through inclusion of minimum content in medical cur-
ricula nationwide, with knowledge, skills and attitudes
which will assist improved access to quality health services
in primary and specialist care. Capacity for coordinated
care, including the mapping of service pathways and
resources for people with ID, should be developed in
each primary health network nationwide. Comprehensive
and uniformly available specialist ID health services
should be developed and made accessible to all people
with ID. Nationwide, a range of health services currently
funded

 threatened with defunding in the roll-out of the NDIS
and these should be transferred to health and expanded.
Key performance indicators should be developed and
collection of outcome measures stipulated for local
health districts in relation to services provision to people
with ID. Finally, this study demonstrates that cause of
death can be better understood in people with ID if the
aetiology of the disability is not coded as the underlying
cause of death. The current convention obscures relevant
and potentially avoidable causes of death for this popula-
tion and should be formally revised.
Our study is not without limitations, as our ID cohort
was derived from people who registered for disability ser-
vices and our cohort only covers 7 years of data. Our ID
cohort accounted for 0.6% of the NSW population in
2011, and people with mild ID may therefore be under-
represented. Independent validation was not performed
on our coding of deaths data for those deaths which
were not previously coded by RBDM. However, a rigor-
ous coding process was undertaken which mirrored that
used for the national data set (ABS). However, the
strengths of this study include the robust data linkage,
report of underlying cause of death and potentially
avoidable deaths, and that our sample is representative
of disability service users with ID. Furthermore, our
future work will expand the cohort size and duration
of study, to allow examination of trends in death rates
over time, and to enable a more detailed examination of
the factors associated with premature death in people
with ID.
