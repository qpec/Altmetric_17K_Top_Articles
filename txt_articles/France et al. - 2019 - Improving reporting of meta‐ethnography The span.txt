Abstract
Aims: The aim of this study was to provide guidance to improve the completeness
and clarity of meta‐ethnography reporting.
Background: Evidence‐based policy and practice require robust evidence syntheses
which can further understanding of people's experiences and associated social pro-
cesses. Meta‐ethnography is a rigorous seven‐phase qualitative evidence synthesis
methodology, developed by Noblit and Hare. Meta‐ethnography is used widely in
health research, but reporting is often poor quality and this discourages trust in and
use of its findings. Meta‐ethnography reporting guidance is needed to improve
reporting quality.
Design: The eMERGe study used a rigorous mixed‐methods design and evidence‐
based methods to develop the novel reporting guidance and explanatory notes.
Methods: The study, conducted from 2015 - 2017, comprised of: (1) a methodologi-
cal systematic review of guidance for meta‐ethnography conduct and reporting; (2) a
review and audit of published meta‐ethnographies to identify good practice princi-
ples; (3) international, multidisciplinary consensus‐building processes to agree guid-
ance content; (4) innovative development of the guidance and explanatory notes.
Findings: Recommendations and good practice for all seven phases of meta‐ethno-
graphy conduct and reporting were newly identified leading to 19 reporting criteria
and accompanying detailed guidance.
Conclusion: The bespoke eMERGe Reporting Guidance, which incorporates new
methodological developments and advances the methodology, can help researchers
to report the important aspects of meta‐ethnography. Use of the guidance should
raise reporting quality. Better reporting could make assessments of confidence in
the findings more robust and increase use of meta‐ethnography outputs to improve
practice, policy, and service user outcomes in health and other fields. This is the first

INTRODUCTION
Evidence‐based decision‐making for health services, policies, and
programmes requires qualitative and quantitative research; this is
recognized by leading evidence‐producing organisations including
Cochrane, the Campbell Collaboration, and the World Health Orga-
nization (Noyes et al., 2018; Uny, France, & Noblit, 2017). To make
sense of large volumes of research, robust syntheses of all types
of research are needed (Noyes et al., 2018). Syntheses of qualita-
tive studies, such as meta‐ethnographies, can be used to develop
theory about how a service, policy, strategy, or intervention works
and how people experience these (Noyes & Lewin, 2011); provide
evidence of the acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness of
interventions or services (Booth, Carroll, Ilott, Low, & Cooper,
2013; Glenton & Lewin, 2016b; Glenton, Lewin, & Gulmezoglu,
2016a; Gulmezoglu, Chandler, Shepperd, & Pantoja, 2013; Pearson,
Wiechula, Court, & Lockwood, 2005); convey people's experiences
of, for example, illness (Campbell et al., 2011; Pound et al., 2005);
and inform the development, implementation, and evaluation of
complex interventions (Carroll, 2017; Rycroft‐Malone & Burton,
2015).

What is meta‐ethnography?
Meta‐ethnography is a seven phase, theory‐based (Turner, 1980) and
potentially theory‐generating, interpretive methodology for qualitative
evidence synthesis developed by sociologists Noblit and Hare (1988)
in the field of education. Meta‐ethnography aims to produce novel
Why is this research or review needed?
• No bespoke reporting guidance exists for meta-ethnography,
one of the most commonly used yet often poorly reported,
methodologies for qualitative evidence synthesis which
could contribute robust evidence for policy and practice.
• Existing generic guidance for reporting qualitative evi-
dence syntheses pays insufficient attention to reporting
the complex synthesis processes of meta-ethnography—
tailored guidance should improve reporting and could
improve quality of conduct.
• Better reporting of meta-ethnographies will likely have
greater impact on understanding of specific phenomena
of interest which will subsequently inform intervention
development and changes in policy and practice.
What are the key findings?
• Recommendations, guidance, and good practice for con-
ducting and/or reporting all seven phases of a meta-eth-
nography were identified for the first time, along with
uncertainties and evidence gaps regarding good practices.
• Nineteen
reporting
criteria
were
developed
including
detailed guidance on Phases 3–6: approach to reading/ex-
tracting data; processes for/ outcome of relating studies;
processes for/ outcome of translation and synthesizing
translations.
• The analysis and interpretation of methodological evi-
dence and novel development work underpinning this
new tailored reporting guidance advances meta-ethnogra-
phy methodology, for example, to incorporate good prac-
tice in translation and synthesis.
How should the findings be used to influence policy/practice/
research/education?
• Use of the guidance by researchers, peer-reviewers, and
journal
editors
to
ensure
complete
and
transparent
reporting of meta-ethnographies will ensure their findings
are optimized for use in policy and practice.
• The guidance can be used to inform the design and con-
duct of meta-ethnographies because of the underpinning
rigorous, comprehensive analysis, interpretation, and syn-
thesis of the latest methodological evidence.

 interpretations that transcend individual study findings, rather than
aggregate findings (Thorne, 2015). Meta‐ethnography involves sys-
tematically comparing conceptual data from primary qualitative studies
to identify and develop new overarching concepts, theories, and mod-
els. It was designed to preserve the original meanings and contexts of
study concepts (Campbell et al., 2011; Noblit & Hare, 1988).
The originators of meta‐ethnography developed a distinctive ana-
lytic synthesis process of “translation” and “synthesis of translations”
(Noblit & Hare, 1988), underpinned by the theory of social comparison
(Turner, 1980), which involves analysing the conceptual data, for
example, concepts, themes, developed by authors of primary studies.

Why is reporting guidance needed
Meta‐ethnography is a distinct, complex and increasingly common
and influential qualitative methodology. It is the most widely used
qualitative evidence synthesis methodology in health and social care
research (Dixon‐Woods, Booth, & Sutton, 2007; Hannes & Macaitis,
2012; Ring, Jepson, & Ritchie, 2011b) and is increasingly used by
other academic disciplines (Uny et al., 2017). Many other qualitative
evidence synthesis methodologies and methods are based on or
influenced by it (Dixon‐Woods et al., 2006; Paterson, 2011; Uny et
al., 2017). A methodological evaluation of the effectiveness of meta‐
ethnography for synthesizing qualitative studies in health and health
care concluded that meta‐ethnography can lead to important new
conceptual understandings of health care issues (Campbell et al.,
2011) and high quality meta‐ethnographies have informed clinical
guidelines (Nunes et al., 2009; Ring et al., 2011a). However, the
quality of reporting in published meta‐ethnographies varies and is
often poor despite methodological advances (Britten et al., 2002;
Campbell et al., 2003, 2011; France et al., 2014; Hannes & Macaitis,
2012). Adequate quality in reporting is one of several prerequisites
to assessing confidence in meta‐ethnography findings that could
inform evidence‐based policy and practice, for instance, in health
and social care (Lewin et al., 2015).
Reporting guidance is commonly used in health and social care
research and can raise publication standards (Plint et al., 2006). For
systematic reviews and meta‐analyses of quantitative studies, the
most commonly used guidance is Preferred Reporting Items for Sys-
tematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) (Moher, Liberati, Tet-
zlaff, Altman, & Group, 2009). For reviews of qualitative studies, the
most commonly used one is the generic 2012 ENTREQ (Enhancing
transparency in reporting the synthesis of qualitative research) state-
ment (Tong, Flemming, McInnes, Oliver, & Craig, 2012). Qualitative
evidence synthesis methodologies differ greatly; therefore, unique
reporting guidance for metanarrative reviews was recently developed
(Wong, Greenhalgh, Westhorp, Buckingham, & Pawson, 2013). There
is currently no guidance on reporting the complex synthesis process
of meta‐ethnography. Such guidance should improve the trans-
parency and completeness of reporting and thus maximize the ability
of meta‐ethnographies to contribute robust evidence to health,
social care, and other disciplines, such as education. Although meta‐
ethnography continues to evolve, reporting guidance is needed cur-
rently for this complex methodology.

METHODS
The methods used to develop the eMERGe meta‐ethnography
reporting guidance followed a rigorous approach consistent with, but
exceeding, good practice recommendations (Moher, Schulz, Simera,
& Altman, 2010) and were published in a protocol (France et al.,
2015). The research questions were:
1. What are the existing recommendations and guidance for con-
ducting and reporting each process in a meta‐ethnography and
why? (Stage 1)
2. What good practice principles can we identify in meta‐ethnogra-
phy conduct and reporting to inform recommendations and guid-
ance? (Stage 2)
3. From the good practice principles, what standards can we
develop in meta‐ethnography conduct and reporting to inform
recommendations and guidance? (Stage 2)
4. What is the consensus of experts and other stakeholders on key
standards and domains for reporting meta‐ethnography in an
abstract and main report/publication? (Stages 3 & 4).
Details of the methods are given in supplementary File S1. Guid-
ance development was conducted by the grant project team (the
first 10 authors), in consultation with the one of the two originators
of meta‐ethnography, George Noblit and supported by a multidisci-
plinary project advisory group of national and international aca-
demics, policy experts, nonacademic users of syntheses such as
clinical guideline developers and lay advisors, who had an active role
in the development of the guidance and whose contributions were
central throughout the project (the 11 authors from A. B. onwards
were advisory group members). Guidance development took place
over a 2‐year period from 2015 to 2017 and comprised four stages,
outlined in Figure 1:
1. Identification of potential reporting standards to include in the
guidance;
2. Development and application of potential standards to published
meta‐ethnographies;
3. Consensus on guidance content;
4. Development of reporting criteria for the guidance and explana-
tory notes.

Stage 1. Identification of standards
Stage 1 was conducted by the grant project team who undertook a sys-
tematic review (PROSPERO CRD42015024709) of relevant method-
ological and reporting guidance on meta‐ethnographies to identify
potential reporting standards (France et al., 2015). From this review,
1128 |
FRANCE ET AL.
 we identified 138 recommendations for meta‐ethnography standards
on reporting from 57 included publications (see supplementary File S2).
2.2
|
Stage 2. Development and application of the
standards
The grant project team reviewed 29 published meta‐ethnographies
(see supplementary File S3) from various academic disciplines and
interviewed nonacademic end users of meta‐ethnographies to iden-
tify good practice principles and recommendations which we then
developed into an audit tool of 109 measurable provisional stan-
dards. The 29 meta‐ethnographies were chosen by academic experts
who were asked to justify why they considered them seminal (i.e.,
they had influenced or significantly advanced thinking and/or were
of central importance in the field of meta‐ethnography) or relatively
poorly reported, or meta‐ethnographies were identified as poorly
reported from published reviews. The team applied the provisional
standards to a purposive sample of 40 published health and social
care‐related
meta‐ethnographies
(selected
from
571
identified
through comprehensive systematic searches to give variation in, for
example, journal, academic discipline, topic, number of included stud-
ies and of authors—supplementary File S1 gives full sampling details)
in a retrospective audit to determine the extent to which the stan-
dards were met (“not at all”, “in part” or “in full”) and to identify
ways the standards could be refined.

 wording, merging duplicative standards, and combining standards
on similar processes to create 53 items which were discussed in
an online workshop and tested in Delphi consensus studies (Lin-
stone & Turoff, 2002) with academic and nonacademic potential
end users. Two parallel, online Delphi consensus studies with
identical questions were conducted: one Delphi for international
experts in qualitative methods (comprising editors or researchers
with prior meta‐ethnography/qualitative evidence synthesis experi-
ence) and one for professional/academic and lay people (potential
end‐users of meta‐ethnographies). Sixty‐two people (39 experts
and 23 professional/lay people) completed all three rounds of the
Delphi. Four items failed to reach consensus in both Delphi stud-
ies and so were excluded from the final guidance (these were the
abstract should ideally differentiate between reported findings of
the primary studies and of the synthesis; state the qualitative
research expertise of reviewers; state in which order primary
study accounts had data extracted from them; state the order in
which studies were translated/synthesized). Participants reached
consensus that 49 of 53 items should be included in the guid-
ance, too many for usable reporting guidance; therefore, further
steps were undertaken to condense these items into fewer report-
ing criteria.

|
Stage 4. Development of the guidance
To develop the final reporting criteria for the guidance, a project
advisory group meeting was convened which had 26 attendees
including expert academics, other professionals, and lay members.
The group discussed and agreed the structure of the guidance and
the accompanying explanatory notes. Following this meeting, the
grant project team agreed which Delphi items should be merged to
create usable guidance. The project advisory group then com-
mented on the readability and usability of the guidance. Members
of the grant project team then further refined the guidance and
explanatory notes. The final guidance and explanatory notes were
checked against the Delphi items to ensure content and meaning
had been preserved throughout this iterative process. Members of
the project advisory group and project team reviewed and agreed
the final guidance table and explanatory notes. Supplementary File
S1 gives details of the methods which also appear in a published
protocol (France et al., 2015) and funder's report (Cunningham et
al., 2018).

HOW TO USE THE GUIDANCE
The eMERGe reporting guidance is designed for use by research-
ers conducting a meta‐ethnography (referred to throughout as
“reviewers”: the term “reviewers” for people who conduct and
report
meta‐ethnographies
was
the
preferred
term
identified
from the eMERGe Delphi studies in line with the increasing use
of systematic review methodology for qualitative evidence syn-
theses), peer reviewers, journal editors, and end‐users of meta‐
ethnographies
including
policy
makers
and
practitioners.
The
eMERGe guidance also provides a helpful structure for anyone
contemplating
or
conducting
a
meta‐ethnography.
While
the
guidance was
developed
for
meta‐ethnography,
some
of
the
reporting criteria, such as those relating to stating a review
question and reporting literature search and selection strategies,
might also be applicable to other forms of qualitative evidence
synthesis and thus overlap with the generic ENTREQ guidance
for reporting a wide range of qualitative evidence syntheses
(Tong et al., 2012). In contrast to eMERGe, ENTREQ does not
provide guidance regarding reporting of the complex analytic
synthesis processes (Phases 4–6) in a meta‐ethnography and did
not follow good practice guidance for developing a reporting
guideline (Moher et al., 2010), for example, it was not designed
with the consensus of a wider community of experts (Cunning-
ham et al., 2018; Flemming, Booth, Hannes, Cargo, & Noyes,
2018).
The eMERGe guidance consists of three parts:
1. Part 1: Table of reporting criteria that are common to all meta‐
ethnographies,
2. Part 2: Detailed explanatory notes on how to apply the com-
mon reporting criteria including supplementary detail of find-
ings
for
phases
3–6
(see
supplementary
information
Table S4),
3. Part 3: Extensions for reporting steps and processes which are
not common to every meta‐ethnography.
Readers should refer to and use all three parts of the guid-
ance. Parts 1 and 2 of the eMERGe reporting guidance are orga-
nized by the seven phases of meta‐ethnography. Suggestions are
provided in the grey cells of the table in Part 1 for where specific
reporting criteria could be reported under journal article section
headings. Where appropriate, reviewers should also consider addi-
tional relevant guidance for reporting other common qualitative
evidence synthesis steps and processes, such as searches for evi-
dence. See for example, the “STARLITE” guidance (Booth, 2006)
and PRISMA (Moher et al., 2009) for reporting literature searches
(refer to the EQUATOR Network for a comprehensive database of
up‐to‐date reporting guidance https://www.equator-network.org/).
Part 3 covers eMERGe extensions for format and content of the
meta‐ethnography output (for example, of an abstract); assessment
of methodological strengths and limitations of included primary
studies; and using the GRADE CERQual approach to assess confi-
dence in findings from qualitative evidence syntheses (Lewin et al.,
2015; Noyes et al., 2018).
Users of this guidance should note that meta‐ethnography is
an iterative process and although the guidance is presented by
meta‐ethnography phases, we are not advocating a linear approach
to
meta‐ethnography
conduct.
Furthermore,
those
conducting
meta‐ethnographies
may
need
to
be
creative
and
adapt
the
methodology to their specific research/review question (Noblit,
2016).

3.2.1
|
PHASE 1—Selecting meta‐ethnography and
getting started
Reporting criterion 1—Rationale and context for the meta‐
ethnography
Consider whether a meta‐ethnography of this topic is needed (Fin-
layson & Dixon, 2008; Kangasniemi, Lansimies‐Antikainen, Halk-
oaho, & Pietila, 2012; Toye et al., 2014), for example, is there an
existing meta‐ethnography on the topic and if so, provide a reason
for updating it (France, Wells, Lang, & Williams, 2016) and describe
the gap in research or knowledge to be filled by the meta‐ethno-
graphy. This should include reviewers describing the availability of
qualitative data which potentially could be synthesized and the
context of the meta‐ethnography, for instance, the political, cultural,
social, policy, or other relevant contexts; any funding sources for
the meta‐ethnography; and the timescales for the meta‐ethnogra-
phy conduct. Reviewers should consider referring to frameworks
which provide guidance on how to specify context, such as Noyes
et al. (2018).
Reporting criterion 2—Aim(s) of the meta‐ethnography
The intention of meta‐ethnography is to produce a new configu-
ration/interpretation,
a
new
model,
conceptual
framework,
or
theory,
although
ultimately
this
might
not
be
possible,
for
instance, if no conceptual innovation had occurred since an
early,
conceptually
rich
primary
study
account
(Atkins
et al.,
2008; Campbell et al., 2011; Malpass et al., 2009). The aim(s) of
the meta‐ethnography should be explicitly stated and should be
compatible with such intentions. The aim may be refined after
reading the literature and examining the available data (Booth et
al., 2016; Campbell et al., 2003, 2011; Finfgeld‐Connett, 2014;
Finfgeld‐Connett & Johnson, 2013). If the initial aim(s) is (are)
changed during Phases 1 and 2, give details of any refinements
made.
Reporting criterion 3—Focus of the meta‐ethnography
The review question(s) should be explicitly stated and be congruent
with the intention of meta‐ethnography. If, during later phases, the
initial review question(s) or objective(s) needed to be refined, give
details of any refinements. A well‐defined review question, specify-
ing a precise focus, can lead to a more efficient synthesis and more
useful output (Atkins et al., 2008; Finfgeld‐Connett, 2014; Finfgeld‐
Connett & Johnson, 2013), for instance, by contributing to clear
study inclusion criteria for Phase 2.
Reporting criterion 4—Rationale for using meta‐ethnography
Many qualitative evidence synthesis methodologies and methods
exist (Booth et al., 2016). Unlike meta‐ethnography, some of these
are aggregative (e.g., thematic analysis, Joanna Briggs Institute
methods), combine qualitative and quantitative data (e.g., critical
interpretive synthesis, metanarrative, metastudy, metasummary, real-
ist synthesis), or have a realist epistemology (e.g., thematic synthesis,
framework synthesis) (Booth et al., 2016; Noyes & Lewin, 2011;
Paterson, 2011). The rationale should be given for why meta‐ethno-
graphy was chosen as the most appropriate metet al.hodology for
conducting an interpretive synthesis (Toye et al., 2014). If reviewers
made adaptations or modifications to Noblit and Hare's (1988)
methodology or methods, state why meta‐ethnography was still con-
sidered the most appropriate methodology and describe all adapta-
tions and modifications made.
3.2.2
|
PHASE 2—Deciding what is relevant
Reporting criterion 5—Search strategy
Explain how the search strategy was informed by the research aim
(s), question, or objectives and the meta‐ethnography's purpose
(Booth,
2013;
Finfgeld‐Connett
&
Johnson,
2013).
Reviewers
should provide a rationale for whether the approach to searching
was comprehensive (search strategies sought all available studies),
purposeful (e.g., searching sought all available concepts until theo-
retical saturation was achieved), or a combination of approaches.
Purposeful searches may be suited for theory‐generating syntheses
(Booth, 2013; Finfgeld‐Connett & Johnson, 2013). In addition, pro-
vide a rationale for the selection of bibliographic databases and
other sources of literature; when searching was stopped if purpose-
ful searches were used; and any search limiters (restrictions to the
searches) such as the years covered, geography, language, and so
on.
Reporting criterion 6—Search processes
Describe and provide a rationale for how the literature searching
was conducted, following appropriate guidance for reporting qualita-
tive literature searches, for example, STARLITE (Booth, 2006), some
journals may also require use of PRISMA (Moher et al., 2009).
Reporting criterion 7—Selecting primary studies
Describe the screening method, such as by title, abstract, and/or
full text review and identify who was involved in study selection.
Specify the inclusion and exclusion criteria for study selection, for
example, in terms of population, language, year limits, type of pub-
lication, study type, methodology, epistemology, country, setting,
type of qualitative data, methods, conceptual richness of data, and
so on. Also, describe any sampling decisions for study selection—
were all relevant studies included or a purposive or theoretical
sample of studies (Finfgeld‐Connett & Johnson, 2013; Suri &
Clarke, 2009)?
Reporting criterion 8—Outcome of study selection
Provide details on the number of primary studies assessed for eligi-
bility and included in the meta‐ethnography. Give reasons for exclu-
sion, for example, for comprehensive searches provide numbers of
studies screened indicated in a figure/flowchart; for purposeful

 searching describe reasons for study exclusion and inclusion based
on modifications to the review question and/or contribution to the-
ory development.
Outcome of study selection can be presented as a primary study
flow

or
narrative—reviewers
should
note
publication
requirements—many journals require a PRISMA type flow diagram
(Moher et al., 2009). If comprehensive literature searches were con-
ducted, reviewers should follow appropriate reporting guidance for-
mats, such as PRISMA (Moher et al., 2009) and STARLITE (Booth,
2006). If publication requirements prevent full reporting, reviewers
should state where readers can access these data in full, for exam-
ple, on a project website, in online files.

PHASE 3—Reading included studies
Reporting Criterion 9—Reading and data extraction approach
This is the phase where the clearest divergence can start to be seen
from other types of qualitative evidence syntheses. As described in
the original meta‐ethnography text:
“… we think it is best to identify this phase as the
repeated reading of the accounts and the noting of
interpretative metaphors. Meta‐ethnography is the
synthesis of texts; this requires extensive attention to
the details in the accounts and what they tell you
about your substantive concerns.” (Noblit & Hare,
1988, p. 28)
Reviewers should describe:
1. the process and strategy for reading included studies to indicate
how close (critical) reading was achieved and who was involved
in reading studies.
2. the strategy for extracting or recording data from included stud-
ies and state who was involved in this, whether processes were
conducted independently by reviewers and whether data were
checked for accuracy and if so, how.
3. the process for identifying and recording concepts, themes, and
metaphors from the primary studies (France et al., 2014). Indicate
whether data were extracted from across the full primary study
(desirable), or specific sections only, for example, findings (not
recommended because conceptual data may appear throughout
the account and the primary study context could be lost (Noblit,
2016; Toye et al., 2014)). Clarify which kind(s) of primary study
findings
were
extracted,
such
as
participant
quotes
and/or
concepts developed by authors of primary studies (sometimes
called first‐ and second‐order constructs, respectively; Britten et
al.,
2002)
so
that
readers
can
follow
reviewers’
concept
development.
Examples of how data extraction has been done include: create a
list of metaphors and themes (Campbell et al., 2011), create a grid or
table of concepts (Britten & Pope, 2012; Erasmus, 2014; Malpass et
al., 2009), or code concepts in a software programme for the analy-
sis of qualitative data such as QSR NVivo (Toye et al., 2014).
Reviewers should state what they mean by the terminology they
have used for the units of synthesis, for example, metaphor, concept,
theme.
Reporting criterion 10—Presenting characteristics of included
studies
Provide a detailed description in narrative and/or table or other dia-
grammatic format of included studies and their study characteristics
(such as year of publication, population, number of participants, data
collection, methodology, analysis, research questions, study funder)
(Britten & Pope, 2012; Toye et al., 2014). If publication requirements
prevent full reporting, state where readers can access these data in
full, for example, a project website, online files.
In addition, provide key contextual information about the primary
studies and comment on their relevance to the context(s) specified
in
the
meta‐ethnography
review
question
(Atkins
et al.,
2008;
Thorne, Jensen, Kearney, Noblit, & Sandelowski, 2004; Toye et al.,
2013). Context of included primary studies can influence the analysis
process (Atkins et al., 2008), for example, primary study accounts
published after a certain date may reflect a change in health policy/
practice such as the introduction of a smoking ban in enclosed public
places. If two or more included primary study accounts, for example,
papers, were derived from the same primary study, this should be
made explicit. Contextual information should include details about
the primary study participants (such as their gender, age, socioeco-
nomic status, ethnicity, and so on); the setting such as a geographical
setting (a country, region, city) or organisation (hospital, school, com-
pany, community); and key political, historical, and cultural factors of
relevance, for instance, the introduction of a major international
guideline, which affected clinical care, preceded publication of
included studies. If such contextual information is not available in
the primary study accounts, reviewers should make this clear to
readers (Table 1).

PHASE 4—Determining how studies are
related
Reporting criterion 11—Process for determining how studies
are related
Reviewers should describe which aspects of the primary studies
were compared and why, to determine how they are related, bearing
in mind the aim of their meta‐ethnography. Aspects could include: (i)
research design, such as the: study aims; contexts; type of studies;
theoretical approach/paradigm; participant characteristics, for exam-
ple, their gender, ethnicity, culture, or age; study focus, for example,
a health or social issue, long‐term conditions, other diseases, or care
settings; (ii) findings—the meaning of the concepts, metaphors, and/
or themes (Noblit & Hare, 1988); the overarching storyline or expla-
nation of a phenomenon from the primary study accounts (Noblit,
2016) and (iii) other contextual factors, such as the time period, for
instance,
whether
findings
of
primary
study
accounts
differed

 because they were conducted in different time contexts. In addition,
reviewers should describe how the studies were compared, that is,
the methods and process of comparison. There is a wide variety of
methods for comparing studies; examples of how Phase 4 has been
reported include: Campbell et al. (2003); Atkins et al. (2008); Malpass
et al. (2009); Beck (2009); Britten and Pope (2012); Erasmus (2014).
Reporting criterion 12—Outcome of relating studies
Describe how primary studies relate: (i) to each other; (ii) to the
review question; and (iii) to the prespecified aspects of context
which were considered important, for example, do they relate recip-
rocally and/or refutationally, or do they explore different aspects of
the topic under study (Atkins et al., 2008; Beck, 2009; Britten &
Pope, 2012; Campbell et al., 2011; Erasmus, 2014; France et al.,
2014; Malpass et al., 2009; Noblit & Hare, 1988)? When reviewers
are reporting how studies are related they should also report “dis-
confirming cases” (Booth et al., 2013; Thorne et al., 2004) that is,
where one or more findings (e.g., metaphors or concepts) from a
study differ from those of other studies for reasons that may be
explained by differences in participants, settings, or study design.
Reviewers can describe how studies were related in narrative, tabu-
lar, and/or diagrammatic form.
3.2.5
|
PHASE 5—Translating studies into one
another
Reporting criterion 13—Process of translating studies
There is a variety of ways to conduct translation; therefore, review-
ers should state their understanding and working definitions of
reciprocal and refutational translation. Examples of approaches to
translation identified by our systematic review are: Atkins et al.
(2008), Campbell et al. (2011), Garside (2008), Toye et al. (2014),
and Doyle (2003). Examples of refutational translation include Gar-
side (2008) and Wikberg and Bondas (2010).
Reviewers should also:
1. state who was involved in translation;
2. describe how meaning was translated from one study into
another, for instance, by reporting one or more examples of how
this was done;
3. describe how relationships between concepts within and across
studies, were preserved in the translation, such as by drawing
concept maps to show relationships between concepts (Kinn,
Holgersen, Ekeland, & Davidson, 2013; Malpass et al., 2009)
(grids, tables, and other visual diagrams could also be used);
4. describe how the contexts of the primary studies were preserved
in the process of translation, for example, were subgroups of
studies translated according to a common health condition or
time‐period (Campbell et al., 2011)?
5. clearly indicate whose interpretation is being presented (France
et al., 2014)—that of the research participants, study authors, or
reviewers (sometimes called first‐, second‐, and third‐order con-
structs, respectively) (Britten et al., 2002);
6. describe how potential alternative interpretations or explanations
were considered in the translation.
Refutational translation is often overlooked (Booth et al., 2013;
Thorne et al., 2004); its purpose is to explain differences and to
explore and explain exceptions, incongruities, and inconsistencies
(Barnett‐Page & Thomas, 2009; Booth, 2013). An entire study could
refute another study (Bondas & Hall, 2007; Britten & Pope, 2012) or
concepts/metaphors within studies could refute one another (Bondas
& Hall, 2007; Britten & Pope, 2012; Finfgeld‐Connett, 2014), in
which case it may be possible to do both reciprocal and refutational
translation in a meta‐ethnography rather than one or the other.
Reviewers should identify disconfirming cases that could inform or
have an impact on translation and, subsequently, synthesis.
Some argue that synthesizing a large number of studies might
result in a superficial synthesis that loses its “groundedness” in the
studies (Campbell et al., 2011); too few studies might result in
underdeveloped theory/concepts (Finfgeld‐Connett, 2014; Toye et
al., 2014). There is no consensus over what constitutes too few or
too many studies; perceptions of a “large” number of studies varies
from over 40 (Campbell et al., 2011) to over 100 (Thorne et al.,
2004). The volume of data will also depend on the richness and
length of those accounts and team size will affect the ability to man-
age the data. If a large volume of data were synthesized, reviewers
should explicitly describe how translation was achieved given this
volume, for example, did they translate studies in smaller clusters to
preserve conceptual richness and/or stay grounded in the data?

 Reporting criterion 14—Outcome of translation
Describe the interpretive findings of the reciprocal translation and
refutational translation—including how each primary study con-
tributed to the translation (Booth, 2013) and describe alternative
interpretations/explanations. Clearly document from which concepts
in primary studies, the reviewers’ concepts are derived (Booth,
2013). Reviewers need to differentiate between concepts derived
from the participants of primary study accounts (sometimes called
first order constructs) and those derived by the authors of the pri-
mary study accounts (sometimes called second‐order constructs).
An example of how this has been reported is Britten et al. (2002)
and a clear table describing the different levels of constructs can
be found in Malpass et al. (2009). Descriptions of the study con-
cepts and reviewers’ concepts and their interrelationships can be
provided in table, diagrammatic or narrative form, with additional
information in supplementary files. When quotes are used, review-
ers should state their origin—primary study participants, primary
study authors, or the reviewers’ own analysis notes. If any study
was reported in more than one paper/account, describe how this
was dealt with.
3.2.6
|
PHASE 6—Synthesizing translations
Reporting criterion 15—Synthesis process
There are two aspects of Phase 6: synthesizing translations and
line of argument synthesis. The synthesized translations (con-
cepts) represent the reviewers’ interpretation of the translations
and are referred to in Britten et al. (2002) as third‐order con-
structs.
A line of argument synthesis aims to provide a fresh inter-
pretation; it goes further than translation and puts any similari-
ties and dissimilarities into a new interpretive context (Noblit &
Hare, 1988). George Noblit (2016) has more recently further
defined a line of argument as the new “storyline” or overarching
explanation of a phenomenon. Reviewers should describe the
methods used to develop synthesized translations and how the
line of argument synthesis was conducted. If line of argument
synthesis
was
not
conducted,
state
why
not.
In
addition,
describe:
1. how many and which studies were synthesized. Sometimes stud-
ies are excluded in Phases 5 and 6 (for instance, because they
lack conceptual depth), so the number of synthesized studies
may differ from the number of studies meeting review inclusion
criteria.
2. who was involved in the synthesis and explain how synthesis
findings have been considered from alternative perspectives (for
example, from different academic disciplines) (Atkins et al., 2008;
Bondas & Hall, 2007; Garside, 2008).
3. how reviewers remained grounded with primary study data and
avoided losing conceptual richness during synthesis, particularly if
a large amount of data were synthesized. (See the discussion on
volume of data to be synthesized in Phase 5).
Reporting criterion 16—Outcome of synthesis process
Describe the interpretive findings of the synthesis of translations,
the line of argument synthesis and any new model, conceptual
framework or theory developed in a narrative, grid, table and/or
visually, for instance, as an illustration, diagram or film. Any of
these may be considered to be a synthesis product and a single
synthesis may have more than one product. Reviewers should
show the inter‐relationships between the data from the primary
studies and the reviewers’ new interpretations. If development of a
new theory, conceptual framework, or model was not possible,
state why not.
Describe the context where the new theory, model, or frame-
work applies, or not, based on the characteristics of included primary
studies. For example, the new theory may have been based solely
on studies of young, white women, or studies conducted in countries
with private health care, or the included studies may be older and/or
predate a significant development in the field.
3.2.7
|
PHASE 7—Expressing the synthesis
Reporting Criterion 17—Summary of findings
Relate the main interpretive findings to the synthesis objective(s),
review question(s), focus, and intended audience(s) (Atkins et al.,
2008; Bearman & Dawson, 2013; Bondas & Hall, 2007; Campbell et
al., 2011; Noblit & Hare, 1988). Compare the concept, model, or the-
ory generated in the synthesis to the existing literature, such as
research and policy publications. Reviewers should consider the pos-
sible influence of findings from other authors (both from primary
study accounts and the wider literature) on their own conclusions
(Booth et al., 2013).
Reporting criterion 18—Strengths, Limitations, and Reflexivity
Consideration of methodological and other strengths and limitations
and how they may influence the final interpretation is a key to
meta‐ethnography
reporting.
Reviewers
should
reflect
on
and
describe the effect of these on the synthesis process and outcomes
because they may affect the credibility and trustworthiness (in other
fields, this is referred to as validity and reliability) of the synthesis
findings.
Strengths and limitations of: (i) the included primary studies; and
(ii) how the meta‐ethnography was conducted should be described.
The latter are infrequently reported in published meta‐ethnographies.
Reviewers should comment on how these aspects may have influ-
enced or limited the synthesis findings:
1. the characteristics, content and context of the primary studies,
such as the temporal context, type of participant, cultural factors,
study design.
2. the conduct of the synthesis. Considerations include, but are not
restricted to: the order in which studies were synthesized (France
et al., 2014; Garside, 2008), the impact of study selection and
sampling, the number of included studies/ volume of data (may
affect depth of analysis), the context of the synthesis, and any

 modifications made to Noblit and Hare's (1988) original method-
ology.
Reflexivity—critically reflecting on the context of knowledge
construction, especially the effect of the researcher on the research
process—should include comment on how the reviewers influenced
the interpretive process and synthesis findings (Walsh & Downe,
2005), for example:
1. the reviewers’ background, perspectives, and experience, such as,
but not limited to, epistemological position(s), professional posi-
tion(s) held, academic discipline, organisation(s), or professional
bodies represented (Thorne et al., 2004);
2. if the reviewers have a specific view, stance, or personal inter-
est, for example, the reviewer's viewpoint on access to abortion
care for a review about women's reproductive health care ser-
vices.
3. any influence of the funder of the meta‐ethnography;
4. any conflicts of interests of the reviewers, that is, any factor, for
example, financial, political, or organizational, which might influ-
ence the judgement of the reviewers when conducting the inter-
pretation and synthesis.
5. how each reviewer was involved and how their contribution to
literature searching and screening, reading of studies, data extrac-
tion, translation, and synthesis may have influenced the interpre-
tive process (Atkins et al., 2008; Bondas & Hall, 2007; Garside,
2008; Toye et al., 2014).

DISCUSSION
The eMERGe guidance is intended to increase transparency and
completeness of reporting, making it easier for diverse stakeholders
to judge the trustworthiness and credibility of meta‐ethnographies
and also intended to make the findings more usable and useful to
inform services and interventions, such as in health, social care, and
education. The development of this guidance used methods follow-
ing, but exceeding, good practice in developing reporting guidance
(Moher et al., 2010) incorporating systematic literature reviews; con-
sensus methods; and consultation with one of the two originators of
meta‐ethnography, George Noblit. The team believe that the guid-
ance is unusual among current reporting guidance in the extent to
which it has involved lay people in all aspects of the development
(France et al., 2015).
This guidance is not intended as a detailed guide in how to con-
duct a meta‐ethnography—some such publications exist (e.g., Atkins
et al., 2008; Britten & Pope, 2012; Campbell et al., 2011; France et
al., 2016; Malpass et al., 2009) and others from the eMERGe project
are in preparation (see http://emergeproject.org/publications/). The
guidance is designed to raise the reporting quality of meta‐ethnogra-
phies and thus to assist those writing, reviewing, updating, and using
meta‐ethnographies in making judgements about quality of meta‐eth-
nography conduct and output. It might also help users of qualitative
evidence syntheses to recognize other forms of qualitative evidence
synthesis mislabelled as a meta‐ethnography, a common occurrence
(France et al., 2014). The guidance does, however, advance the
methodology through its comprehensive analysis, interpretation and
synthesis of methodological publications on meta‐ethnography, pub-
lished since Noblit and Hare's original monograph, which underpin
the reporting criteria and explanatory notes.
Some might argue that the guidance is overly prescriptive and
detracts from the original purposes of meta‐ethnography and, indeed,
qualitative research. It is our view and that of others (Thorne, 2017)
who conducting a meta‐ethnography involves creative, interpretive,
qualitative analysis methods; however, a creative and interpretive
approach should not preclude describing clearly how the research was
conducted and some guidance is required to avoid misuse or misla-
belling of the methods (Thorne, 2015) and poor or misleading report-
ing. In this guidance, definitions and requirements have not been
imposed arbitrarily, unnecessarily, or where consensus is lacking.
Meta‐ethnography has been described as an advanced qualitative
research methodology (Campbell et al., 2011; Finlayson & Dixon,
2008; Toye et al., 2014) probably reflecting its complexity as a
methodology. Training materials to accompany this guidance including
video clips and slides (available from http://emergeproject.org/
resources) have been developed as part of the eMERGe project.
This guidance has been designed to have the flexibility to be
applied to
diverse reporting formats with differing
publication
requirements (for example, journal articles, reports, book chapters)
and this explains why some standards, which apply only to certain
formats, are included as “extensions” to the guidance. Publication
requirements can limit manuscript length; therefore, reviewers might
need to provide some data in an alternative format, such as online,
to achieve full reporting.
Methodological developments in meta‐ethnography and in rele-
vant qualitative evidence synthesis methodology generally will con-
tinue
to
occur.
This
guidance
was
created
with
an
eye
to
accommodating these future developments which will be monitored
through our discussion list: www.jiscmail.ac.uk/META-ETHNOGRA
PHY. Future research will investigate the impact of the eMERGe
reporting guidance, for example, by updating our earlier systematic
review of meta‐ethnography reporting practices (France et al., 2014),
with a view to updating the guidance and we regard this guidance
1136 |
FRANCE ET AL.
 as one baseline from which to track the evolution of meta‐ethnogra-
phy.

CONCLUSION
This guidance has been developed following a rigorous approach
in line with and exceeding good practice in creating reporting
guidance. It is intended to improve the clarity and completeness
of reporting of meta‐ethnographies to facilitate use of their find-
ings to inform the design and delivery of services and interven-
tions in health, social care, and other fields. Qualitative data are
essential for conveying people's (e.g., patients, carers, clinicians)
experiences and understanding social processes and it is important
that they contribute to the evidence base. Meta‐ethnography is an
evolving qualitative evidence synthesis methodology with huge
potential to contribute evidence for policy and practice. In future,
changes to the guidance might be required to encompass method-
ological advances and accommodate changes identified after evalu-
ation of the impact of the guidance.
