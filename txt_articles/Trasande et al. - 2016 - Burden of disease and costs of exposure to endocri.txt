SUMMARY
A previous report documented that endocrine disrupting chemicals contribute substantially to certain forms of disease and disabil-
ity. In the present analysis, our main objective was to update a range of health and economic costs that can be reasonably attributed
to endocrine disrupting chemical exposures in the European Union, leveraging new burden and disease cost estimates of female
reproductive conditions from accompanying report. Expert panels evaluated the epidemiologic evidence, using adapted criteria from
the WHO Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group, and evaluated laboratory and
animal evidence of endocrine disruption using definitions recently promulgated by the Danish Environmental Protection Agency.
The Delphi method was used to make decisions on the strength of the data. Expert panels consensus was achieved for probable
(>20%) endocrine disrupting chemical causation for IQ loss and associated intellectual disability; autism; attention deficit hyperactiv-
ity disorder; endometriosis; fibroids; childhood obesity; adult obesity; adult diabetes; cryptorchidism; male infertility, and mortality
associated with reduced testosterone. Accounting for probability of causation, and using the midpoint of each range for probability
of causation, Monte Carlo simulations produced a median annual cost of €163 billion (1.28% of EU Gross Domestic Product) across
1000 simulations. We conclude that endocrine disrupting chemical exposures in the EU are likely to contribute substantially to dis-
ease and dysfunction across the life course with costs in the hundreds of billions of Euros per year. These estimates represent only
those endocrine disrupting chemicals with the highest probability of causation; a broader analysis would have produced greater
estimates of burden of disease and costs.
INTRODUCTION
In earlier reports (Bellanger et al., 2015; Hauser et al., 2015;
Legler et al., 2015; Trasande et al., 2015) we described substan-
tial burden of disease that is likely to be the byproduct of endo-
crine disrupting chemical (EDC) exposures in the European
Union (EU). The primary goal of this work was to inform an
impact assessment by the EU Commission, which is focused on
the economic impact to industry of regulating EDCs in Europe.
We endeavored to estimate the health and economic benefit of
regulating EDCs in Europe, as based on current evidence. We
identified a substantial probability of very high disease costs
across the lifespan associated with EDC exposure in the

 European Union, with a median of €157 billion cost/year across
1000 Monte Carlo simulations. This cost is approximately 1.23%
of GDP.
In our earlier report of overall results (Trasande et al., 2015),
we were only able to report on expert panel deliberations for
obesity/diabetes; male reproductive health; and neurobehavioral
deficits and diseases. An expert panel was also convened for
female reproductive conditions; those deliberations are now
completed, and described in an accompanying report (Hunt
et al., 2016). The main purpose of this manuscript was therefore
to update aggregate cost estimates to account for probability
over the previously described exposure-outcome relationships,
as well as the newly described relationships in the accompany-
ing manuscript. We also present country-specific estimates of
aggregate costs, as these have proven to be of great interest to
individual member countries since the initial report. Finally, in a
discussion, we take the opportunity to reflect on comments and
other related reports that have also been recently published on
the disease burden and costs of EDCs in Europe.
METHODS
The approach to the expert panel deliberations for female
reproductive conditions; assessment of probability of causation;
selection and modeling of exposure-outcome relationships; and
estimation of costs followed the previously published approach
(Trasande et al., 2015). We highlight critical aspects of the analy-
sis below for the reader who is not familiar with the previous
work.
We followed the Institute of Medicine approach to assess the
fractional contribution of the environment to causation of illness
(1981). This approach focuses on quantifying the attributable
fraction (AF) or increment in disease or disability above an unex-
posed proportion. The AF can be estimated insofar as there are
available data about prevalence of exposure and relative risk
(Smith et al., 1999). Having identified the attributable disease
rate, the appropriate population or other estimates were used to
calculate attributable cases, and cost-of-illness data were used
to extrapolate attributable costs.
Leveraging a more novel approach, we adapted a weight-of-
evidence characterization for probability of causation from the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2005). Evaluations
of the toxicology and epidemiology literature from the Danish
Environmental Protection Agency (Hass et al., 2012) and GRADE
Working Group (Atkins et al., 2004; Schunemann et al., 2008)
were applied to assess strength of evidence, and the strength of
the literature was used to assess a probability that the disease
costs estimated through the IOM approach are causally related
to EDCs.
Monte Carlo modeling of total EDC-attributable costs again
used 1000 simulations of scenarios across the fifteen exposure-
outcome relationships. Recognizing that probability of causation
could be highly influential on cost estimates, we performed
three sets of these simulations, using midpoints of the ranges for
probability of causation for each exposure-outcome relationship
as a base case scenario, and low and high bounds of the proba-
bility range as alternate scenarios, to assess the sensitivity of
Monte Carlo simulations to this input. For each of the three sets
of simulations, we produced ranges of burden and disease costs
associated with EDCs. Country-specific estimates used country-
specific data for the population affected by the relevant
condition under study, and did not assume differences in
biomarkers of exposure at the country level. Per capita costs
were estimated by dividing aggregate costs by total population.
RESULTS
The female reproductive panel identified more modest proba-
bility (20–39%) for dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) cau-
sation in 56,700 cases of fibroids requiring surgical management
annually,
and
for
145,000
phthalate-attributable
cases
of
endometriosis per year. The annual estimated cost of these
preventable conditions was found to be €1.41 billion. Table 1
presents an updated list of the evaluations of fifteen exposure-
outcome relationships across the five expert panels.
Adding these new findings to the analysis, the base case Monte
Carlo simulation using the midpoint of each range for probabil-
ity of causation produced costs between €714 million to 251 bil-
lion annually across the 1000 simulations (median, €163 billion;
Fig. 1). This estimate represents a subset of the actual direct and
indirect costs of diseases considered because of its reliance on
published disease costs data. Using the 2010 EU purchasing-
power-parity corrected Gross Domestic Product (GDP) estimate
of €127.9 billion (Eurostat, 2015), the estimated costs comprise
1.28% of GDP. There is a 5% probability that costs of EDC expo-
sures are less than €22.5 billion annually, a 90% probability that
costs are at least €33.1 billion, a 75% probability that costs are at
least €75.2 billion/year, a 25% probability of costs at least €196
billion/year, and a 10% probability of costs over €215 billion/
year.
Using the lowest end of the probability range for each relation-
ship in the Monte Carlo simulations produced a range of €0–238
billion (median, €112 billion) that differed modestly from the
base case probability inputs. There is a 5% probability that costs
of EDC exposures are less than €9.55 billion annually, a 90%
probability that costs are at least €16.0 billion, a 75% probability
that costs are at least €34.1 billion/year, a 25% probability of
costs at least €182 billion/year, and a 10% probability of costs
over €204 billion/year. Applying the lowest end of the probability
range and assuming all the relationships are independent,

disease in Europe. Leaving aside the highly probable costs of
developmental neurotoxicity from organophosphate pesticide
and brominated flame retardants, there is still a substantial
probability (>98.8%) that one or more of the other exposure-
outcome relationships are causal. Using the highest end of the
probability ranges narrowed the range of costs more substan-
tially (€20.0–256 billion; median €180 billion). There was a
21.3% probability of costs under €100 billion, and a 33.0%
probability of costs over €200 billion.
We present base case scenario estimates of country-specific
costs in Table 2. The largest burden after accounting for proba-
bility of causation was borne by France (€25.6 billion), Germany
(€24.6 billion), the United Kingdom (€24.7 billion), and Italy
(€17.5 billion). As a percentage of country GDP, Slovakia’s cost
(3.21%) was highest, followed by Ireland (1.75%) and Bulgaria
(1.56%). Per capita costs were €322 across the entire European
Union, and highest in Luxembourg (€791), Ireland (€583), and
the Netherlands (€411).

 DISCUSSION
The findings of the accompanying manuscript (Hunt et al.,
2016) reinforces our earlier findings – indeed, there is a substan-
tial probability of very high disease costs across the lifespan asso-
ciated with EDC exposure in the European Union. For some
perspective, the median €163 billion cost/year we identified is
approximately one-fifth the €798 billion European cost of brain
disorders in 2010 (Gustavsson et al., 2011), or 1.28% of GDP.
Dividing the total cost by the European population of 506 million,
suggests a per capita cost of €322, or €1288 for a family of four.
As the accompanying manuscript emphasizes (Hunt et al.,
2016), the additional costs we have included in these updated

EDCS, DISEASE AND COSTS: AN UPDATE
ANDROLOGY
 estimates are a subset of the actual costs of conditions that affect
women and can be etiologically attributed to EDCs. There is sub-
stantial evidence, recently summarized by the Endocrine Soci-
ety, for effects of a host of EDCs, including bisphenol A (BPA),
phthalates, pesticides, and persistent organic pollutants (POPs)
on the developing ovary and reproductive tract.
We wish to reflect in the remainder of this manuscript on
comments and other related reports that have also been recently
published on the disease burden and costs of EDCs in Europe.
Woodruff has rightly identified that our estimate of costs
because of phthalate-attributable mortality owing to reductions
in testosterone may be highly underestimated (Woodruff, 2015).
If the value of a statistical life is $4–9 million, as described by
multiple authors (Viscusi & Aldy, 2003), then the costs of the
early mortality we identified would be $99.3–223 billion rather
than $7.96 billion. We took a human capital approach to our esti-
mation, rather than a willingness-to-pay approach, and so revi-
sion of the $7.96 billion estimate to the higher number is not
appropriate at this time. However, it is fair to state that lost eco-
nomic productivity represents a subset of the welfare losses
associated with early mortality. We agree that the total costs of
phthalate-attributable mortality because of reductions in testos-
terone are likely to be much higher. Thus, it is an important dis-
cussion to determine whether the $4–9 million value of a
statistical life is appropriate here, but we note that this is another
source of potential underestimation of the cost of human
exposures.
We also note a difference in the estimation of attributable
infertility costs performed by the Nordic Council of Ministers
(Olsson, 2014). We modeled increases in infertility in a cohort of
20–40 year old women estimating annual costs because of
phthalate exposures, which implicitly assumes that all women in
that cohort who are not using contraception are indeed trying to
conceive, with a subset of those seeking medical care and actu-
ally resulting in health care expenditures. In comparison, the
Nordic Council modeled an attributable fraction of measurable
assisted reproductive technology treatments, assuming that a
percentage was because of a group of endocrine disrupting
chemicals. We identified 618,000 additional assisted reproduc-
tive technology procedures, whereas the Nordic Council identi-
fied 26,600. The Nordic Council included indirect and intangible
costs, which represent more than two-thirds of its €263 million
cost estimate of these cases, whereas our €4.71 billion estimate
includes only direct costs.
Rather than revising our estimate at this time, which differs
from the Nordic estimate because of different assumptions
made explicit in both publications, we note that assisted repro-
ductive technology procedures are most frequent among older
women within the 20–40 year old range. If indeed the more
appropriate population is 30–40 year old women instead, our
estimate of attributable cases would be 50% lower, although we
note that our estimate of costs per case may have been conserva-
tive by a factor of three. We also note that we assumed a single
infertility treatment cycle per case of phthalate-induced infertil-
ity, whereas more than one treatment cycle may be needed,
whether for a single pregnancy or a subsequent one in a persis-
tently subfertile couple. It is best at this point to lay these
assumptions open for discussion, noting that the two economic
estimates may span a range that represents actual costs.
This latter set of concerns does not diminish the overall
austerity of the approach we took in this exercise. Our work
surely represents a substantial underestimate of actual EDC-
attributable disease given its focus on <5% of EDCs; examina-
tion of a subset of health effects; and exclusion of human
suffering and other societal costs of EDC-attributable dis-
eases. In addition, recent work has suggested that the bio-
marker-based studies may suffer from exposure imprecision
that
underestimates
the
degree
of
the
actual
exposure-
response
relationships
used
in

disease
burden
(Budtz-Jørgensen et al., 2003). Future work can interrogate a
broader array of EDCs, and effects of mixtures, using system-
atic review methods which others have developed (Rooney
et al., 2014; Thayer et al., 2014).
We do still acknowledge some limitations in our approach,
particularly with respect to modeling country-level costs. We
were unable to model differences in exposure at the country
level because of lack of exposure data, and could only account
for purchasing power differences in modeling country-level
costs. More refined, country-level data about EDC exposures are
clearly needed, and can inform the effect of policy interventions
as well as identification of subgroups and areas of greatest
concern.
CONCLUSIONS
Assessing EDC-associated costs is not easy, but we have
quantified these costs in Europe in a straightforward and
transparent methodology grounded on work first conducted
by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the
World Health Organization. This work was assessed by a
group of internationally recognized experts in epidemiology,
toxicology, economics, EDCs, and neurodevelopment. Con-
cerns about uncertainties do not diminish the impact of our
conservatively formulated findings for policy makers consider-
ing methods to reduce exposure to the EDCs of greatest con-
cern. The economic rewards of doing so are likely to be in
the billions of Euros and accrue annually insofar as alterna-
tives free of health effects are used.

 MEETING COMMENTS
Tue Søeborg (Copenhagen, Denmark)
Is this the first time that a study like yours has been performed
to assess the cost of the harmful effects of endocrine disrupting
chemicals (EDCs)? Can you draw on experience from previous
samples such as the cost of drugs from the pharmaceutical
industry including the cost of anti-cancer therapeutics?
Leonardo Trasande (New York, USA)
The original methods for assessing the cost of environmental
health effects were described by the Nobel Laureate Kenneth
Arrow in the 1981 Institute of Medicine Report. Our work was
based on their long-term track record and our methods have
been elaborated in the context of uncertainty of causation link-
ing chemicals to disease.
Shanna Swan (New York, USA)
Can you comment on the risks and benefits of banning chemi-
cals and the associated value to society of the product? We must
consider the importance of the usefulness of the chemical when
justifying its regulation. For example, perfumes are a major
source of exposure to phthalates, but how important are they to
society?
Marie Louise Holmer (Copenhagen, Denmark)
The
REACH
(Registration,
Evaluation,
Authorisation
and
Restriction of Chemicals) project regulates substances which are
used in a variety of products. These products are used for differ-
ent purposes in different settings, so on a substance level it
might be difficult to make such clear distinctions. But phthalates
are, for example, used in both hospital equipment and house-
hold products, and the importance to society of the different
uses is taken into account when restrictions are discussed. Your
point is valid.
Leonardo Trasande
California’s TB 117 law was passed based on the theoretical
value of using flame retardants in all furniture, but the overuse
of these products caused unacceptable exposure to polybromi-
nated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and the Law has been repealed.
Our work involves a comprehensive evaluation of the use of
chemicals including their cost and benefits, but these must be
considered for different settings. The use of pesticides in devel-
oping countries must be considered in the context of the burden
of disease such as malaria. We must also compare the health
cost of a chemical to the cost of replacing it with a safer product.
R�
emy Slama (Grenoble, France)
Your new way forward of assessing cost combines risk with
level of evidence, but this is contradictory to the precautionary
principle whereby we do not wait for certainty before taking
action. Your analysis is an estimate of cost on a yearly basis, but
there is built in inertia in this field and must be examined in a
temporal dimension. The use of DES was banned but there are
still ongoing effects occurring at present. The situation is the
same for persistent pollutants. When a substance is banned, you
must consider its costs and effects of health over the next
50–100 years because of current exposure in utero or at an
early age.
Leonardo Trasande
I agree that an effect is not stopped as soon as the use of a
chemical is eliminated. In the formal cost benefit analysis for a
particular regulatory decision, the years of decay of a persisting
chemical must be considered in addition to existing exposure.
The effect of past exposure and long term exposure must be con-
sidered, and any benefit must include the reduction in cost
which would occur from reductions in ongoing and future use.
In the United States, typically the health effects are modeled
over a 25–30 years period.
Anders Juul (Copenhagen, Denmark)
Have you had any reactions to your publication?
Leonardo Trasande
The general response in the EU has been supportive and the
only negative comment was a suggestion that our approach was
informed speculation. Consistent epidemiological data from
multiple birth cohorts documenting a dose–response lowering of
IQ as a result of exposure to organophosphate pesticides and
flame retardants supported by toxicological evidence is not
speculation but is cause for action.
