This work was performed at the University of Pittsburgh, 230 McKee Place, Suite 600, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.
Study Objectives: Social media (SM) use has been positively associated with disturbed sleep among young adults. However, previous studies have not 
elucidated the specific importance of SM use immediately before bed. We aimed to determine the independent association of SM use during the 30 minutes 
before bed and disturbed sleep while controlling for covariates including total SM use throughout the day.
Methods: We assessed a nationally representative sample of 1763 US young adults aged 19–32. Participants estimated to what extent they used SM in the 
30 minutes before bed. We assessed sleep disturbance using the brief Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®) Sleep 
Disturbance measure. After testing the proportional odds assumption, we used ordered logistic regression to compute the independent association between SM 
use before bed and sleep disturbance controlling for covariates, including total SM use.
Results: Compared with those who rarely or very rarely check SM in the 30 minutes before bed, those who often or very often check SM at that time had an 
adjusted odds ratio of 1.62 (95% confidence interval = 1.31–2.34) for increased sleep disturbance. Additionally, we found a significant linear trend in the odds 
ratios between the frequency of checking SM in the 30 minutes before bed and increased sleep disturbance (p = .007). Results were consistent in all sensitivity 
analyses.
Conclusions: SM use in the 30 minutes before bed is independently associated with disturbed sleep among young adults. Future work should use qualitative 
and experimental methods to further elucidate the directionality of—and mechanisms underlying—this association.
Keywords: bed, social media, technology, sleep quality, PROMIS.
INTRODUCTION
Insufficient sleep is highly prevalent among young adults,1 and 
it is associated with daytime sleepiness2 and a range of poor 
health outcomes.3–6 Social media (SM) use, which has increased 
rapidly in recent years,1,7 has been positively associated with 
disturbed sleep among young adults.8–11 SM use has also been 
associated with factors linked to disturbed sleep—such as 
higher levels of anxiety and depression—among adolescents.12 
Screen media are commonly used by youth and young adults,13 
and their use has been associated with important sleep-related 
outcomes such as shorter sleep duration, later sleep timing, and 
poorer sleep quality.14 Because SM commonly involve inter-
active screen time, it may be more detrimental to sleep than 
more passive types of screen media, such as watching televi-
sion.15 Therefore, a focus on SM, rather than screen time more 
generally, has particular relevance for sleep and related health 
outcomes.
Little work has examined the specific association between 
the time of day of SM use and sleep outcomes. It may be that 
any SM use is associated with poor sleep, regardless of time 
of day. SM use commonly involves alerts interrupting thought 
processes throughout the day,12 which may impede relaxation at 
bedtime and potentially disturb sleep at night.12,16 Additionally, 
increased SM use during the day may displace time that was 
meant to be devoted to completing other tasks; this may delay 
bedtime or disturb the nighttime routine if daytime tasks are 
instead being completed late at night.
However, it may also be that SM use specifically near bedtime 
may be particularly influential with regard to poor sleep, even 
when compared with daytime use. For example, nighttime SM 
use may contribute to anxiety or depression at bedtime,12 per-
haps because of social comparison or negative interactions expe-
rienced while on SM.17 Another possibility is that SM use close 
to bedtime may disrupt normal sleep-wake cycles and circadian 
rhythms by introducing light close to the eyes from the blue end 
of the color spectrum; this type of short-wavelength-enriched 
light is emitted by many devices on which individuals use SM.18,19
Determining the relative importance of SM use just before 
bed—compared with total SM use (SM use across the entire 
day)—will be valuable in the development of evidence-based 
recommendations for young adults regarding best practices 
around ubiquitous SM use. For example, if the last 30 minutes 
before bed is identified as a potentially critical time, clinical 
recommendations for individuals with disturbed sleep can be 
appropriately focused. Therefore, the purpose of this study was 
to assess the independent association of SM use during the 30 
minutes before bed and poor sleep outcomes, even when con-
trolling for total SM use. Based on some prior literature noted 
above,12 we hypothesized that increased use in the 30 minutes 
before bed would be independently associated with poor sleep.
Statement of Significance
While total social media (SM) use has been associated with sleep disturbance, this study extends prior findings by determining that SM use in the 30 
minutes before bed is independently associated with disturbed sleep. Because this study was cross-sectional, future work should focus on elucidating the 
direction of this association and the mechanisms underlying it. Should future work show a causal association between these variables, it will be valuable 
for individuals experiencing sleep disturbance to target reduction of SM use in the period before bed to potentially reduce disturbed sleep. This may be 
more feasible and acceptable than attempting to reduce total SM use. Future work should also focus on identifying and testing feasible prevention and 
intervention strategies aimed at reducing SM use before bed.

SM Before Bed and Sleep Disturbance—Levenson et al.
METHODS
Participants and Procedures
Overall methodology has been described in detail in prior 
reports.9 In brief, we assessed a nationally representative sam-
ple of US young adults, drawn from a large-scale web-based 
research panel developed and maintained by the survey research 
company Growth from Knowledge (GfK). The panel, known as 
the KnowedgePanel®, was formed by GfK via both random digit 
dialing—from both land lines and cell phones—and address-
based sampling.20,21 Therefore, the KnowledgePanel’s sampling 
frame represents approximately 97% of US households.
From October to November 2014, the web-based survey was 
sent via electronic mail to a random sample of 3048 noninsti-
tutionalized adults between the ages of 19 to 32. These adults 
had consented to participate in a previous wave of a two-wave 
longitudinal study assessing various health behaviors (wave 
1 response rate = 54%). The data used for this analysis were 
collected as part of the study 18-month follow-up (wave 
2) because SM use was not assessed during the baseline sur-
vey. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board 
of the University of Pittsburgh and was granted a Certificate 
of Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health. All 
participants provided informed consent before commencing 
participation.
Measures
Independent Variable: Social Media Use Before Bed
Participants were asked to estimate how frequently over the 
past year they “Checked social media in the 30 minutes before 
falling asleep at night?” In order to capture a full range of SM 
use before bed, initial response choices were very rarely; rarely; 
sometimes; often; and very often. For analysis, these response 
choices were collapsed into three categories: (1) rarely and very 
rarely, (2) sometimes, (3) often and very often to form more 
clinically relevant results.
Dependent Variable: Sleep Disturbance
We assessed sleep disturbance with the Patient-Reported 
Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®) 
Sleep Disturbance scale.22,23 This instrument assesses problems 
with sleep, difficulty falling asleep, whether sleep was refresh-
ing, and sleep quality over the past 7 days. Each item was 
measured on a Likert-type scale, ranging from not at all (1) to 
very much (5). Due to the non-normal distribution of data, we 
collapsed the sleep measure into tertiles (low, medium, or high 
sleep disturbance) based on the raw score distribution. Specific 
cut points were consistent with those previously reported in the 
literature.9
Covariates
In order to ensure that SM use before bed was not simply a 
marker for total SM use, we included as a covariate total SM 
use. Participants self-reported the typical total number of min-
utes per day they used SM for personal use. Based on the distri-
bution of data and on prior published literature, responses were 
collapsed into quartiles (0–30 minutes; 31–60 minutes; 61–120 
minutes; 121 minutes+).24–27 Participants were specifically 
instructed not to report on work-related use. We also assessed 
multiple sociodemographic factors that have previously been 
associated with SM use and/or sleep problems, including age, 
sex, race, relationship situation, living situation, household 
income, and educational attainment.28 We decided a priori to 
categorize age into tertiles based on the distribution of the data 
and in order to achieve more interpretable results.
Analysis
We used chi-square tests to examine differences in each of the 
SM use variables and covariates among each sleep disturbance 
group. After confirming that the proportional odds assumption 
was satisfied, we used ordered logistic regression to assess the 
independent association of SM use before bed with sleep distur-
bance while controlling for all covariates, including overall SM 
use. Ordered logistic regression was appropriate because the 
dependent variable (sleep disturbance) was ordered categorical. 
All primary analyses used survey weights that adjusted not only 
for undercoverage and overcoverage but also for nonresponse. 
Survey weights were calculated by GfK using post-stratifica-
tion adjustment based on sociodemographic benchmark distri-
butions. Because each control variable has been associated with 
sleep disturbance in the past,28 primary analyses controlled for 
all measured covariates.
To confirm the robustness of our results, we conducted three 
sets of sensitivity analyses. First, we conducted all multivaria-
ble analyses only adjusting for covariates with bivariable asso-
ciations of p < .15 or stronger with the outcome to ensure that 
our models had not overcontrolled. Second, we computed all 
models operationalizing all variables as continuous when possi-
ble (eg, age). Finally, we conducted all analyses without survey 
weights. Because all sensitivity analyses showed similar find-
ings to primary results, only results from the primary analyses 
are presented here.
Statistical analyses were performed with Stata 12.1 (Stata 
Corp, College Station, Texas), and two-tailed p-values  < .05 
were considered significant.
RESULTS
Of the 3048 individuals to whom invitations were sent, 1796 
responded (response rate = 59%). A total of 1763 individuals 
had complete data on our primary independent and dependent 
variables. There were no differences between those who pro-
vided complete responses and were thus included in our analy-
ses (n = 1763) and those who did not (n = 1285) in terms of age 
(p = .12), sex (p = .07), or race (p = .21).
Table 1 depicts demographic characteristics of the weighted 
sample. Accounting for survey weights, 39.8% of our sample 
was categorized into the low sleep disturbance group, 27.3% 
was categorized into the medium disturbance group, and 32.9% 
was in the high sleep disturbance group. Nearly one-third of 
the sample reported checking SM often or very often in the 30 
minutes before bed.
SM use in the 30 minutes before bed, total SM use, and 
household income differed significantly among the three sleep 
disturbance groups. Specifically, those in the low sleep distur-
bance group were more likely to rarely check SM (49.6%) than 
to check it sometimes (22.3%) or often (28.1%), while those 
in the high sleep disturbance group were more likely to check 
SM often (37.5%) than to check it rarely (34.7%) or sometimes

(27.8%). With regard to household income, participants in the 
low and medium sleep disturbance groups were most likely 
to report high levels of household income (42.2% and 42.3%, 
respectively), while those in the high sleep disturbance groups 
were most likely to report medium levels of household income 
(37.9%).
In bivariable regression models, using SM before bed was 
significantly associated with sleep disturbance. For example, 
compared with those who rarely or very rarely check SM before 
bed, those who often or very often check SM before bed had an 
odds ratio (OR) of 1.69 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.24–
2.33) for having a higher level of sleep disturbance. There was 
a significant linear trend in the ORs between SM use before 
bed and sleep disturbance (p = .001). In bivariable analyses, 
sleep disturbance was also associated with total SM, older age, 
female sex, Hispanic and other race/ethnicity, and low socioec-
onomic status (Table 2).
In fully adjusted models, participants with more frequent SM 
use before bed retained significantly greater odds of having 
sleep disturbance, even after accounting for total SM use and 
all covariates. In particular, compared with those who rarely or 
very rarely check SM before bed, those who often or very often 
check SM before bed had an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of 1.62 
(95% CI = 1.31–2.34) for having a higher level of sleep distur-
bance. Similarly, compared with those who rarely or very rarely 
check SM in the 30 minutes before bed, those who reported 
“sometimes” checking SM 30 minutes before bed had an AOR 
of 1.48 (95% CI = 1.06–2.08) for having a higher level of sleep 
disturbance. There was a significant overall linear trend in the 
ORs between use before bed and sleep disturbance (p = .007). 
Other covariates significantly and independently associated 
with increased sleep disturbance included overall SM use, older 
age, other race, and low socioeconomic status (Table 2).
DISCUSSION
We found that, among a nationally representative sample of 
young adults, greater SM use in the 30 minutes before bed was 
independently associated with greater sleep disturbance, even 
when controlling for total SM use. A second major finding was 
that total SM use remained independently associated with sleep 
disturbance in the overall adjusted model.
These findings build on previous work demonstrating greater 
total SM use to be associated with greater sleep disturbance.9,12 
In particular, we extend the existing literature by identifying 
that there is a specific time of day, just before bed, when SM 
use may have a particularly strong association with sleep. The 
current analysis does not offer information on the specific 
direction of effect, limiting our ability to provide specific clin-
ical recommendations at this time. Nevertheless, should future 
work show a causal association between SM use before bed and 
subsequent sleep disturbance, we would then be able to suggest 
that individuals experiencing sleep disturbance may choose to 
target reduction of SM use in the period before bed to poten-
tially reduce disturbed sleep. Future work should also investi-
gate the period before bed in which reduction of SM use would 
have the most impact on improving sleep (eg, 30 minutes vs. 1 
hour). As opposed to the suggestion to reduce total SM use, a 
time-specific recommendation may be more feasible for some 
young adults, should future work support it. This suggestion 
would be in accord with recent recommendations from the 
American Academy of Pediatrics that children and adolescents 
get adequate sleep, that they not sleep with devices in their bed-
rooms, and that they avoid exposure to devices/screens for 1 
hour before bed.29 Our findings are also consistent with a recent 
report showing that media use of various types in the 2 hours 
before bed was associated with shorter total sleep time and later 
bedtimes among university students.30
It is interesting to note that total SM use remained a signifi-
cant predictor of sleep disturbance in the adjusted model. This 
suggests that total amount of SM use across the day also has a 
meaningful association with sleep that is not explained by prox-
imity to bedtime. Therefore, while focusing on the 30 minutes 
before bed may be of particular value for some young adults, 
for others, SM use at other times of the day may also be valua-
ble to explore. For example, some young adults may use SM in 
the afternoon as a way of avoiding school work or other tasks; 
this may serve to push back the completion of this work further 
into the evening or night, delaying bedtime or impacting sleep 
quality. Thus, our findings serve as an important reminder of the 
individual differences in SM use and its association with sleep.
As mentioned above, because of the cross-sectional nature of 
our data, it is impossible to determine the direction of asso-
ciation among SM use before bed and sleep disturbance. One 
possibility is that increased SM use before bed contributes to 
greater sleep disturbance. For example, the blue light emitted 
by many SM devices may impact self-reported sleepiness, slow 
wave activity during sleep, and circadian phase, and recent work 
has shown that SM use before bed can impair these sleep-related 
outcomes.18,31 While preliminary research has suggested that 
these effects can be mitigated by daytime bright light exposure 
or blue-light shielding eyewear,32,33 using these methods may 
have limited practicality for some young adults. Additionally, 
because SM use may promote emotional or cognitive arousal, 
SM use before bed in particular may interfere with sleep.34 This 
is consistent with a prior study in which nighttime-specific SM 
use and an emotional investment in SM were both associated 
with poorer sleep quality, lower self-esteem, and higher levels 
of anxiety and depression among adolescents.12 Thus, in some 
young adults, SM use before bed may contribute to anxiety and 
emotional arousal, which may contribute to sleep disturbance. 
Future qualitative and experimental work would help to further 
elucidate these mechanisms.
On the other hand, it is possible that the association between 
SM use and sleep disturbance is in the opposite direction; that 
is, those who have greater levels of sleep disturbance may be 
more likely to use SM, especially in the 30 minutes before 
bed.35 Some young adults who have difficulty falling asleep 
may turn to SM as a way of passing the time or distracting from 
the frustration of not sleeping while in bed attempting to do 
so. Indeed, a recent report showed that a substantial proportion 
of adults use media as a sleep aid, which was associated with 
increased sleep disturbance.36 Thus, it may not be surprising 
that we found an association between sleep disturbance and SM 
use specifically in the 30 minutes before bed because the period 
just before bed may be one of the most common times of the 
day to use SM among those who already have difficulty sleep-
ing. It is also possible that unmeasured variables such as anxiety 
may account for the association between SM use before bed

and sleep disturbance. Some young adults feel anxious at dis-
engaging from SM; for example, they may be concerned about 
the possibility of missing an SM prompt from a friend. Indeed, 
recent work has shown that emotional investment in SM sig-
nificantly predicted poorer sleep quality among adolescents.12 
Should future research support this hypothesized direction of 
effect, clinical recommendations may include that individuals 
experiencing sleep disturbance seek evidence-based treatment 
for difficulty falling asleep, rather than turning to SM as a cop-
ing strategy. For these individuals, using SM as a way of passing 
the time may reinforce the association between being in bed and 
being awake, which is contrary to evidence-based approaches 
for treating insomnia.37 Moreover, coping in this way might 
result in interactive screen time, which can be more stimulating 
than other non-SM activities such as reading a book.15
One important limitation of these analyses is the fact that both 
SM use and sleep disturbance were assessed via self-report. 
While this methodology was necessary for this large survey, 
future work should aim to include more robust, gold-standard 
measures of sleep quality, such as actigraphy, sleep diary, and/
or the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.38 We chose to collapse 
the SM use response choices into three categories, based on 
distribution of the data and difficulty in interpreting the dif-
ference between “very rarely” and “rarely” and “very often” 
and “often”. Because this may have limited our understanding 
of the users at the extremes, it would be interesting for future 
research to obtain more nuanced responses such as, “on an aver-
age day, how many minutes out of the past 30 are you using 
social media?” Similarly, it would be useful for future research 
to utilize more intensive measures of SM use, such as ecolog-
ical momentary assessment. Additionally, as mentioned above, 
it should be reiterated that, because the data included in these 
analyses are cross-sectional, our ability to draw causal conclu-
sions about the direction of the observed associations is lim-
ited. While we have suggested that “state” anxiety related to 
SM use may account for the association between SM use and 
sleep disturbance, it is also possible that trait level anxiety may 
also play an important role. We were unable to control for trait 
anxiety in the current analyses, but future work should seek to 
determine the impact of this factor. Last, participants estimated 
the frequency of their SM usage before bed on average, over 
the course of the year. Thus, it is not possible to know whether 
participants were checking SM for just a minute or two prior 
to bed on a very frequent basis or whether they were spending 
the entire 30 minutes on a less frequent basis, and these two 
patterns of usage may have warranted the same rating.
Despite these limitations, this nationally representative study 
suggests that SM use in the last 30 minutes before bed is an 
independent risk factor for disturbed sleep among young adults. 
Suggestions for limiting SM use during this time, particularly 
to people with sleep concerns, may be a feasible and effective 
strategy that should be further studied in both prevention and 
intervention efforts.
