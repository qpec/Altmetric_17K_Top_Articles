Abstract
Importance—Parent-adolescent sexual communication has received considerable attention as 
one factor that can positively impact safer sex among youth; however, the evidence linking 
communication to youth contraceptive and condom use has not been empirically synthesized.
Objective—This meta-analysis examined the effect of parent-adolescent sexual communication 
on youth safer sex behavior and explored potential moderators of this association.
Data Sources—A systematic search was conducted of studies published through June 2014 
using Medline, PsycINFO, and Communication & Mass Media Complete databases and relevant 
review articles.
Study Selection—Studies were included if they: 1) sampled adolescents (mean sample age≤18); 
2) included an adolescent report of sexual communication with parent(s); 3) measured safer sex 
behavior; and 4) were published in English.
Data Extraction and Synthesis—Correlation coefficients (r) and 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) were computed from studies and meta-analyzed using random-effects models.
Main Outcomes and Measures—The primary outcome was safer sex behavior, including use 
of contraceptives/birth control or condoms.
Results—Seventy-one independent effects representing over three decades of research on 25,314 
adolescents (mean age = 15.1) were synthesized. Across studies, there was a small, significant 
weighted mean effect (r = .10, [95% CI:0.08–0.13]) linking parent-adolescent sexual

 communication to safer sex behavior, which was statistically heterogeneous (Q = 203.50, p < .001, 
I2 = 65.60). Moderation analyses revealed larger effects for communication with girls (r = .12) 
than boys (r = .04), and among youth who discussed sex with mothers (r = .14) compared to 
fathers (r = .03). Effects did not differ for contraceptive versus condom use, or among longitudinal 
versus cross-sectional studies, indicating parent sexual communication had a similar impact across 
study designs and outcomes. Several methodological issues were identified in the literature; future 
studies can improve on these by measuring parent-adolescent communication with robust, multi-
item measures, clearly specifying the target parent, and applying multi-method longitudinal 
designs.
Conclusions and Relevance—Sexual communication with parents, particularly mothers, 
plays a small protective role in adolescent safer sex behavior, and this protective effect is more 
pronounced for girls than boys. Implications for practice and suggestions for future research on 
parent-adolescent communication are discussed.
INTRODUCTION
Risky sexual behavior among U.S. adolescents is a serious public health problem. Although 
adolescents make up only a quarter of the sexually active population, they acquire half of all 
sexually transmitted infections (STIs).1 This amounts to 9 million STIs, including over 
8,300 new cases of HIV, each year.1 Additionally, adolescents are at heightened risk of 
unintended pregnancy.1,2
Parent-adolescent sexual communication has received considerable attention as one factor 
that could positively impact youth safer sex behavior, including adolescents’ use of 
contraception and condoms. There are both practical and theoretical reasons why parents 
may be agents of sexual socialization for young people. From a practical perspective, parents 
may play a critical role in conveying sexual information and may exert significant influence 
on adolescents’ sexual attitudes, values, and risk-related beliefs.3,4 Parents may also provide 
a powerful model of open and honest communication about sexual health issues, which teens 
may emulate in their own sexual relationships.5
Parents’ influential role on child and adolescent behavior is also widely accepted in 
developmental and health behavior theory. Bronfenbrenner’s classic Ecological Systems 
Theory6 of human development suggests that individuals live within a series of nested 
systems – including the family system – that are dynamic, reciprocal, and can directly and 
indirectly influence behavior. Grounded in this approach, parent-adolescent sexual 
communication has increasingly been implicated in health behavior theories that explain 
youth sexual behavior,7–9 such as the multi-system perspective of adolescent sexual risk 
behavior.9
Although practical and theoretical considerations suggest that parent communication should 
be strongly associated with adolescent safer sex behaviors, there is surprising inconsistency 
in the empirical literature.3,9–12 While several studies have found moderate, positive 
associations between parent communication and youth contraceptive or condom use,13–16 
other studies have found non-significant or even negative effects.17–19 Further, while it is 
possible that parental communication about sex can be protective for youth, open sexual

 communication often does not take place. Instead, embarrassment, inaccurate knowledge, or 
low self-efficacy may prevent some parents from engaging their children in honest and 
supportive conversations about sex.20 These barriers may explain why nearly a quarter of 
youth report that they have not discussed sexual topics with a parent,3,21–23 and why even 
fewer have had meaningful, open conversations about the sexual issues that are critical to 
their long-term health.
Current Study
The purpose of the current meta-analysis was to synthesize this literature and determine the 
mean weighted association between parent-adolescent sexual communication and youth 
contraceptive and condom use. Findings from such an analysis are critical to the growing 
body of HIV, STI, and pregnancy prevention efforts that target adolescent-parent dyads,24–26 
and may be of considerable interest to researchers, educators, family practitioners, and 
parents themselves. To our knowledge, no such meta-analysis has been published to date, 
despite a number of narrative reviews and calls for better synthesis of the literature.3,9–12 A 
first goal of this meta-analysis was to estimate the magnitude of the association between 
parent communication and adolescent safer sex behavior. We focused on safer sex behavior 
– i.e., contraceptive and condom use – given the importance of these behaviors to the 
prevention of HIV, STIs, and unintended pregnancies.27
Given the heterogeneity in this literature, a second goal of the current meta-analysis was to 
examine several potential moderators of the association between communication and safer 
sex. Two key moderators examined were adolescent gender and parent gender. Given 
existing evidence, we expected to find a more robust association between communication 
and safer sex behavior for girls compared to boys28–31 and for communication with mothers 
compared to fathers.19,32 Several additional demographic and measurement moderators were 
also explored. These factors have been examined in prior work and are of direct relevance to 
family communication interventions. They included: a) adolescent age; b) race/ethnicity; c) 
study location (U.S./non-U.S. sample); d) study design (cross sectional/longitudinal); e) 
communication measurement characteristics (source/topic/format/number of items); and f) 
safer sex outcome (contraceptive use/condoms).
METHOD
Search Strategy
A detailed search was undertaken to locate relevant articles. First, comprehensive searches 
of PsycINFO, Medline, and Communication & Mass Media Complete databases were 
conducted through June 2014 using the following combination of key words: (adolescen* 
OR teen* OR youth OR middle school OR high school) and (communicat* OR discuss* OR 
negotiat* OR assert* OR talk OR influence) and (contracept* OR birth control OR condom* 
OR unprotected sex OR sex* risk OR safe* sex). Then, additional studies of potential 
relevance were located by examining review articles related to sexual 
communication.3,9–11,33–36

 Selection Criteria
Studies were included if they met the following criteria: 1) sampled adolescents, defined as a 
mean sample age of 18 or younger and no participants over 24 years of age;37 2) included an 
adolescent report of sexual communication with a parent or parents (studies that focused 
exclusively on parent-reported communication were excluded); 3) measured safer sex 
behavior, including contraceptives/birth control, condoms, or unprotected sex; 4) reported an 
association between parent-adolescent communication and safer sex behavior (when 
bivariate associations were not reported, authors were directly contacted for this 
information); and 5) were published in English. We excluded papers that used a composite 
variable for sexual risk taking where it was not possible to tease apart the outcome of 
contraceptive/condom use (e.g., combining number of sex partners or abstinence along with 
condom use into a single composite variable38,39). Additionally, in a few instances, there 
were multiple relevant papers that utilized the same dataset; in these cases, the article with 
the most complete data relevant to this meta-analysis was included.
The initial search produced 5,098 scientific references. After a title and abstract review, this 
was reduced to 510 references. The full text of these 510 articles were then located and 
reviewed. After applying all selection criteria, the final sample consisted of 52 articles (see 
Figure 1). Within this final sample, several articles reported results separately for 
independent samples, including ten studies with analyses separated by gender, two studies 
separated by race/ethnicity, and one study separated by country (see eTable). Independent 
effect sizes were calculated for each sample in these cases, resulting in a total of 71 
independent effect sizes.40
Most studies reported a single indicator of communication and safer sex behavior. When 
multiple indicators were reported, several steps were taken to avoid violating the 
independence assumption that underlies the validity of meta-analyses.41 First, when studies 
reported contraceptive or condom use with both a frequency score as well as use at first or 
last intercourse, we utilized the frequency variable to calculate an effect size, as this is more 
representative of the overall pattern of contraceptive use.42 Next, when studies reported 
more than one measure of parent-adolescent sexual communication, we analyzed the data in 
one of two ways. For the majority of analyses, we averaged these communication variables 
in order to maximize the use of available data and not advantage one measure over another 
(i.e., overall weighted effect size and comparisons by age, gender, ethnicity, and study 
location). However, for analyses that examined moderation by communication measurement 
characteristics, using this averaging approach would have resulted in a loss of specificity of 
variables, and thus a loss of data. For these analyses, we used a random number generator to 
randomly select one variable for inclusion.37,41 The same procedure was used to handle the 
three studies that reported both general contraceptive use and condom use.17,43,44 
Specifically, we averaged the effect of communication on these sexual health outcomes for 
primary analyses, but we used a random number generator to select one outcome variable 
from each study when we examined the type of outcome (contraceptive use vs. condom use) 
as a moderator.37,41

 Data Extraction
Two authors independently coded the following data from each study: (a) demographic and 
sample characteristics; (b) sexual communication measurement characteristics (i.e., 
communication topic, format, source, number of items); and (c) safer sex behavior 
measurement (i.e., type of safer sex behavior; measurement timeframe). Communication 
topic was coded into four possible categories, including communication about: 1) 
contraception/condom use, 2) pregnancy, 3) STIs/HIV, or 4) general sex topics (e.g., 
discussing “sex”). Communication format was coded into three categories: 1) 
communication behavior/frequency (i.e., ever/never or indication of sexual communication 
frequency), 2) communication quality (i.e., perceived comfort, ease, or openness of 
communicating), and 3) self-efficacy (i.e., perceived confidence in ability to communicate 
about sex). Finally, communication source was coded based on the parent with whom the 
adolescent had discussed sex: 1) mother, 2) father, or 3) parent(s). Regarding safer sex 
behavior, the type of safer sex was coded as: 1) general contraception/birth control, 2) 
condom use, or 3) unprotected sex (reverse coded to keep direction of effects consistent), 
and the measurement of safer sex timeframe was coded as: 1) lifetime, 2) past 6 months, 3) 
past 3 months, 4) first sex, or 5) last sex. The mean percentage agreement between coders 
across all categories was 96%. Discrepancies between coders were resolved through 
discussion with the first author.
Calculation of Effect Sizes
A correlation coefficient (r) was used as the indicator of effect size (range= −1.0 to +1.0).45 
Effect sizes based on correlations can be interpreted as small (.10), medium (.25), or large (.
40).46 When bivariate rs were reported in an article, they were directly extracted. If rs were 
not reported, then appropriate formulas were used to convert other statistics (e.g., t tests, 
summary statistics, odds ratios) to approximate rs.45,47 When none of the statistics could be 
converted to a correlation coefficient, or when only multivariate analyses were reported, 
study authors were contacted and appropriate raw data were requested. To keep effect sizes 
consistent and interpretable, values were transposed so that positive correlations always 
indicated a positive association between communication and safer sex behavior.
Once study characteristics were coded and effect sizes were extracted, a Fisher r to z 
transformation was performed.45 These values then were weighted by their inverse variance 
and combined. We used random effects meta-analytic procedures for the primary analysis 
across all 71 independent effect sizes; this procedure allowed for the possibility of differing 
variances across studies.41 After analyses were complete, the effect sizes were transformed 
back to rs for presentation. The Q statistic and I2 were used to examine whether significant 
heterogeneity existed among effect sizes. Effect sizes for hypothesized moderators were 
calculated along with their 95% confidence intervals, and those effect sizes were compared 
using the Qb statistic. For these analyses, mixed effects models were utilized to allow for the 
possibility of differing variances across subgroups. These models employ random effects 
assumptions, while stratifying the effect sizes by fixed factors such as gender and study 
location.41 Analyses were conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software, Version 
2.

 RESULTS
Study Characteristics
The eTable provides a summary of the 52 studies and 71 independent effect sizes 
represented in this meta-analysis, including sample characteristics and moderator variables. 
Across studies, 25,314 participants were included (weighted mean age=15.2). Of the 71 
independent effect sizes, the majority were based on reports of communication with a 
“parent” or “parents” (k=52); 19 studies specified whether communication was with a 
mother or father. Similarly, the majority of studies asked about general sexual 
communication (k=47), with 25 studies assessing more specific topics, such as condom use, 
HIV/STIs, or pregnancy. Additionally, more than half of studies (k=36) used single-item 
assessments of sexual communication; the remaining studies measured communication with 
two to five items (k=17), six to 10 items (k=7), or more than 10 items (k=8). Among all 
studies, the primary design was cross-sectional (k=64); seven studies utilized a longitudinal 
design to examine parent-adolescent sexual communication as a predictor of later 
contraceptive or condom use.4,28,31,44
Magnitude and Direction of Effects
There was a small, significant overall weighted mean effect for the association between 
parent-adolescent sexual communication and safer sex behavior: r = .10 (95% CI, 0.08–0.13) 
(see Figure 2). Funnel plots of the effect sizes were symmetrical, and the trim and fill 
analysis suggested no adjustment to the mean effect size.48 This indicated no evidence of 
publication bias.
Heterogeneity and Effect Size Moderators
Although the overall relationship between communication and safer sex was positive and 
significant, there was considerable heterogeneity among the effect sizes (Q = 203.50, p < .
001, I2 = 65.60). Thus, we examined the potential impact of several moderating variables. 
Studies were only included in moderator analyses if they had sufficient information to be 
analyzed. For example, when considering gender as a moderator, studies had to sample only 
boys, only girls, or both genders, but report separate analyses by gender (mixed gender 
samples that did not separate analyses by gender could not be included, as there was no way 
to tease apart the relationship between communication and contraceptive use for boys versus 
girls). The number of studies (k) included in each moderator analysis is indicated in the text 
below and in Table 1.
First, we examined moderators related to participant demographics and study design. As 
shown in Table 1, there was significant moderation by gender (k=48), with a stronger 
association between parent-adolescent communication and safer sexual behaviors with girls 
(r = .12) compared to boys (r = .04). The strength of this association was not found to differ 
significantly by adolescents’ age (k=62) or ethnicity (k=71), or by the location of study 
(k=70). Additionally, effect sizes did not differ significantly when comparing longitudinal 
versus cross sectional study designs (k=71).

 Next, several aspects of sexual communication were examined as potential moderators 
(Table 1). Among studies that specified the source of communication (i.e., mother versus 
father; k=19), the association between sexual communication and youth safer sex behaviors 
was significantly stronger for adolescents who had discussed sexual topics with their 
mothers (r = .14) versus fathers (r = .03). In fact, communication with fathers was not 
significantly associated with adolescent safer sex behavior across studies (r = .03; p = .46). 
The strength of the association between communication and safer sex did not differ 
significantly based on the topic of conversation (k=71), the format of communication 
measurement (k=70), or the number of items used to assess communication (k=68).
Finally, two factors specific to the outcome of safer sex behavior were examined as 
moderators, including the type and timing of safer sex examined in each study. As shown at 
the bottom of Table 1, effects did not differ based on the safer sex outcomes (k=71), with 
similar significant associations found for both contraceptive use (r = .09) and condom use (r 
= .12). Effects were also consistent across the measurement timeframes (i.e., lifetime, past 6 
months, past 3 months, first sex, and last sex; k=67).
DISCUSSION
Pooling data from three decades of research with over 25,000 adolescents, the current meta-
analysis found a significant positive association between parent-adolescent sexual 
communication and youth safer sex behavior. This effect was robust across condom and 
contraceptive use outcomes, cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, and among both 
younger and older samples. Importantly, the strength of this association was moderated by 
adolescent and parent gender, with stronger effects for girls than boys and for 
communication with mothers than fathers.
Importantly, the relationship between parent communication and adolescents’ contraceptive 
and condom use was significantly stronger for girls than for boys. This is consistent with 
past work showing that parents communicate more frequently with girls and are also more 
likely to stress the negative consequences of sexual activity when discussing sex with 
daughters compared to sons.21,23,30,49–51 If parents wish to exert a stronger influence on 
their sons’ safer sex practices, they may need additional training to change the frequency, 
content, and/or tone of the messages surrounding sex that they communicate to boys.
The association between communication and safer sex was also moderated by the gender of 
the parent. Specifically, adolescent communication with mothers was positively associated 
with use of protection, but there was not a significant association between father-adolescent 
communication and safer sex behavior. Across a variety of circumstances, men and boys are 
less verbally expressive, open to self-disclosure, and attuned to emotional and relational cues 
compared to girls and women.52 This difficulty in sharing emotional experiences or 
discussing potentially embarrassing relational topics may inhibit some boys’ and fathers’ 
abilities to have open and intimate conversations about sexual health. It would be ideal to 
examine whether specific factors related to fathers’ communication might amplify the 
impact of communication on adolescents’ safer sex practices – such as how often fathers are 
communicating with their sons or daughters and the specific content or comfort level of

 these conversations; unfortunately, there are currently too few studies of father 
communication to examine these fundamental questions. This remains a ripe area for future 
inquiry.
Taken together, our results confirm that across more than 50 studies, parent-adolescent 
sexual communication is positively associated with adolescents’ contraceptive and condom 
use practices, regardless of communication topic or format. However, this effect explained a 
relatively small proportion of the variance in safer sex behavior. Thus, results underscore the 
importance of understanding parent communication – likely a more distal predictor – in the 
context of more proximal factors that contribute to sexual decision-making. Building on 
preliminary models of parent-adolescent communication,7,8,10 future theoretical and 
empirical work should examine how parent communication impacts individual-level factors 
(e.g., attitudes and self-efficacy53) as well as couple-level factors (e.g., partner 
communication and negotiation processes37,54), and how these and other factors may 
mediate the association between communication and safer sex. In line with family systems 
theory,55 it is also possible that alternative parenting constructs, such as parent-adolescent 
relationship quality, parental monitoring, or the marital relationship itself, may interact with 
communication to predict youth sexual behavior.39 Future work will benefit from in-depth 
analyses of the role that parental communication may play in adolescent sexual decision-
making within these multiple domains of influence.
Methodological Considerations
Several methodological issues were identified in this literature review that may have 
obscured the detection of more robust effects and are worthy of future research attention. In 
particular, addressing these study design issues may elucidate why several expected 
communication measurement characteristics (i.e., topic and format)37,54 did not emerge as 
significant moderators of the association between communication and behavior.
First, many studies assessed sexual communication with unspecified “parent(s).” In these 
cases, it was not possible to know if youth were reporting communication with mothers, 
fathers, or both parents. Given the current moderator findings, as well as previous research 
demonstrating more frequent communication with mothers on sexual issues than with 
fathers,56 the overall association may be mostly driven by communication with mothers. 
Additional research is needed to better understand this issue.
Second, more than half of studies used single-item assessments of parent-adolescent 
communication. This is not ideal from a measurement perspective, as single-item 
assessments are unlikely to capture the full nuance and complexity of the communication 
process. It is clear that the quality and timing of communication can have important 
implications for youth sexual decision-making.58 Given that many parents misjudge when 
their adolescents begin sexual activity, communication about sex may begin after sexual 
initiation and limit the potential impact of these discussions.22,59 To further our 
understanding of communication among adolescents and their parents, we need to utilize not 
only brief measures of the content or frequency of communication, but also in-depth 
measures of the timing, tone, and style of these sexual discussions.10,36,57 This may require 
mixed methods longitudinal studies in which quantitative reports are collected alongside

 qualitative interviews, perhaps utilizing ecological momentary assessments to capture 
communication soon after it occurs. It would also be useful to obtain reports of 
communication from both adolescents and their parents, to identify discrepancies in the 
frequency or quality of communication that each individual reports.13
Finally, of the 71 independent effects identified, only seven utilized longitudinal designs. 
While there were not significant differences in the effect sizes drawn from cross-sectional 
versus longitudinal studies, additional work should utilize multi-wave longitudinal designs 
to tease out the timing of communication and contraceptive behavior.
Implications for Intervention Efforts
Results of this study confirm that parent-adolescent sexual communication is a protective 
factor for youth, and a focus on communication remains justified in future intervention 
efforts. Because conversations about sexuality can be uncomfortable or embarrassing for 
both parents and adolescents, educational efforts may be most successful if they provide 
clear, practical instruction and help parents optimize the timing and language used in their 
approach.25 In addition to formal intervention programs with parents, physicians and other 
health care providers who interact with parents and youth are in a unique position to 
encourage healthy communication about sexual topics. Specifically, physicians can have 
clear and honest conversations about sexual health issues in professional settings to model 
sexual communication skills,61 perhaps helping families initiate these conversations. They 
can also urge both parents and adolescents to have such conversations at home, as well as 
provide resources to parents on when and how to discuss sensitive sexual health topics.
Conclusions
This study fills a critical gap in the literature by meta-analyzing the association between 
parent-adolescent sexual communication and youth safer sex behavior. Across more than 
three decades of research and 25,000 adolescents, the current meta-analysis suggests that 
communication with parents – particularly among mothers and girls – has a small protective 
effect on adolescent contraceptive and condom use. Further research utilizing more 
sophisticated assessments, longitudinal designs, and mixed methods approaches are needed 
to advance this literature and to better understand the impact parents have on the health of 
their adolescents.

Note. N = sample size; k = number of studies (when groups do not total 71, it is because one or more studies were missing the appropriate information to be included in that analysis); r = weighted mean 
effect size; CI = confidence interval. Mixed effects models are presented for moderator analyses.
aModerator analyses by communication source compared mother to father communication; the mean weighted effect of communication with “parent(s)” was r = .10, p < .001 across studies.
