Objective: This report evaluates clinical experience with the Rezūm system after US Food and 
Drug Administration clearance in consecutive cases accrued by multiple community urologists 
for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic 
hyperplasia (BPH). Treatment techniques for transurethral convective radiofrequency water-
vapor thermal therapy and outcomes with up to 12 months’ follow-up are presented.
Materials and methods: A total of 131 patients with moderate–severe LUTS were included 
in a retrospective analysis of BPH procedures with the Rezūm system. Pre- and postprocedure 
assessments included International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), quality of life, peak uri-
nary flow rate, voided volume, and postvoid residual urine volume. Urologists used their own 
discretion for patient selection, with variable prostate sizes, LUTS severity, urinary retention, 
or presence of an obstructing median lobe. Safety signals and surgical retreatment rates were 
monitored prospectively.
Results: Men aged 47–96 years with prostates 13–183 cm3 showed significant improvement 
in IPSS, quality of life, and postvoid residual volume durable through 12 months after thermal 
therapy. Patients with either moderate (IPSS 8–19) or severe (IPSS 20–35) symptoms achieved 
significantly improved scores. Postprocedure adverse events normally anticipated and related 
to endoscopic instrumentation were transient and mild–moderate in nature. No de novo erectile 
or ejaculatory dysfunction was reported.
Conclusion: This study corroborates prior published pilot and randomized controlled trial 
results indicating significant relief of urinary symptoms and reproducibility of responses to 
thermal therapy. Convective radiofrequency thermal therapy with the Rezūm system warrants 
consideration as a first-line treatment for LUTS/BPH as an alternative to the use of pharma-
ceutical agents.

of voiding and obstructive LUTS. The ten most prominent 
and costly disease conditions in men over 50 years of age in 
the US include BPH with LUTS,1 and it is the commonest 
diagnosis made by urologists for men 45–74 years of age.2 A 
review of several large administrative and community-based 
cohorts through the year 2000 indicated a high prevalence of 
BPH, with almost 8 million visits made to physicians’ offices 
for a primary or secondary diagnosis of this condition.3 Over 
a broader time span, data from the National Ambulatory 
Medical Care Survey (1993–2010) identified over 101 million 
outpatient visits for men with a diagnosis of BPH/LUTS.4,5
Treatment options include medical, surgical, and a new 
wave of minimally invasive therapies. The treatment-strategy 
challenge relates to when to initiate treatment, substitute, or 
advance to more aggressive therapy. The objective should 
always focus on achievement of the best specific outcome 
(eg, improving LUTS and preserving erectile and ejaculatory 
function) for each patient, but with consideration of costs 
to both patients and payers. It is estimated that 20% of the 
population will reach 65 years of age or older by 2030 and 
those 85 years and older will represent the fastest-growing 
segment of our population.6 Therefore, the prevalence of 
symptomatic BPH will increase proportionally with this 
aging population and foretells significant health-care system 
financial pressures related to BPH care.7 The expenditure for 
this chronic condition exceeds US$1 billion in the Medicare 
program alone, and is estimated to be as high as $6 billion.3,8
The availability of minimally invasive surgical treatment 
(MIST) for LUTS/BPH now allows the urologist to tailor 
therapies in a continuum of care from medical management 
to more invasive surgical procedure approaches. A recent 
new MIST (Rezūm) employs a platform technology to con-
vectively deliver to prostate tissue stored thermal energy in 
the form of water vapor (steam) created with radiofrequency 
(RF) current to produce instantaneous cell death in targeted 
tissue. The procedure is transurethral needle ablation, but 
with considerably more efficient delivery of thermal energy 
to heat and ablate the tissue. Convective RF thermal therapy 
with the Rezūm system results in rapid, significant, and 
durable improvements in LUTS, while at the same time 
preserving erectile and ejaculatory function.9–13 There are 
minimal transient perioperative side effects but resultant 
enhanced quality of life (QOL) in patients with LUTS due 
to BPH. The safety and effectiveness of convective RF 
thermal therapy with the Rezūm system is supported by 
selective evidence-based clinical studies.13 Although random-
ized controlled trials (RCTs) have provided guidelines and 
expectations within designated criteria for use of a device, 
acquisition of data after US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) clearance of a device provides great value in devel-
oping patient-management strategies and reassuring the 
community of practicing urologists concerning safety and 
efficacy in a broader patient population.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of BPH treatments with the Rezūm system from 
community urology-practice groups following FDA clear-
ance of the Rezūm system in 2015. The objective was to 
include detailed patient selection, evaluation, and surgical 
techniques of this next-generation transurethral thermal 
therapy. This is the first report of the clinical and practical 
assessments of a postmarket device to provide a more realistic 
and broader-spectrum view of real-world patients compared 
to patients in a registration-directed RCT with restrictive 
inclusion and exclusion criteria. The retrospective analysis 
includes outcomes to 12 months of postprocedure follow-up.
Materials and methods
Plan for patient accrual
Men with bothersome LUTS due to BPH were treated with 
Rezūm convective RF thermal therapy by multiple urologists 
in two large group practices from November 2015. Data 
accrual up to 12 months of follow-up continued until May 
2017. These centers were early users of this thermal therapy, 
each with its own standard of practice for evaluation of 
LUTS, selection of patients appropriate for ablative thermal 
therapy, and assessment of response to the therapy. Compared 
to a formal clinical trial, clinicians had flexibility in patient 
selection with respect to variable prostate sizes, symptom 
severity, flow rate, and no morphological limitations, includ-
ing patients with an obstructing median lobe and/or enlarged 
central zone. Patient selection and treatment did not follow a 
standardized protocol. Although the intent was to follow as 
many patients as possible, there was no obligation for patients 
to comply with follow-up evaluations. Each center provided 
prospectively accrued data on consecutively treated men for 
analysis; total accrual for evaluation was planned for at least 
100 patients. Patient chart reviews were performed with the 
approval of the Western Institutional Review Board. Patient 
consent was not required by the board, as deidentified patient 
numbers were assigned for data accrual on Excel spreadsheets 
to maintain patient-data confidentiality.

Convective radiofrequency thermal therapy for BPH
and single-use transurethral delivery device, and utilizes a 
standard reusable 4 mm, 30° rigid lens allowing treatment 
needle placement under direct cystoscopic visualization. The 
stored thermal energy of water vapor is created by applying 
RF current against an inductive coil in the handle of the 
delivery device (Figure 1). The handheld control delivers 
thermal energy in the form of water vapor at approximately 
103°C, providing a consistent energy dose of approximately 
208 calories per treatment into the prostate tissue through a 
retractable 18-gauge polyetheretherketone (insulated plastic) 
needle. The Rezūm system and the principles of RF-generated 
water-vapor thermal energy based on the thermodynamic 
properties of convective versus conductive heat transfer to 
ablate tissue have been previously described.10,13 The device 
received Conformité Européene (European Conformity, CE) 
marking in 2013 and 510(k) clearance from the FDA in 2015. 
The commercially marketed device and therapeutic algorithm 
are the same used in the previous RCT.10,12 All treating phy-
sicians received training prior to use of the Rezūm system.
Patient selection and evaluation
Patients with moderate–severe LUTS were offered treatment 
with the Rezūm system to ameliorate the anatomical tissue 
interference that causes BPH and outlet obstruction as an 
alternative to medications for symptomatic relief, or after 
inadequate relief or intolerance of drug use. Similarly, the 
progression of prostate-tissue impediment may be halted 
as the result of treatment at an earlier stage. While early 
clinical experience suggests excellent outcomes in larger 
glands, a urologist’s early experience for treating BPH with 
the Rezūm system should be reserved for smaller glands until 
more experience has been gained. The anatomy of larger 
glands may be challenging, include the propensity for some 
bleeding. Patients may have anticoagulation withheld for 
the procedure and for a short time afterward in consultation 
with their cardiologist.
Routine assessments included a complete medical his-
tory and physical examination, prostate-specific antigen, 
cystoscopy, transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS), urinalysis, 
maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax) and postvoid residual 
(PVR) urine-volume measurements. Patients completed the 
International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire, 
unless they were in urinary retention, and the IPSS QOL ques-
tion. Urodynamic studies are helpful in assessing appropriate 
patients for treatment, but this practice is not uniformly rec-
ommended prior to proceeding with surgical therapy, based 
on American Urological Association Guidelines for manage-
ment for BPH.14 One of the pitfalls of proceeding with treat-
ment without urodynamics may involve ignorance of bladder 
function, including either impaired bladder contractility or 
overactivity that may contribute to the total LUTS complex. 
When obtained, urodynamics are felt to be invaluable to 
provide a basis for perioperative issues. The management 
of pain and anxiety is based on clinicians’ discretion. This 
can be assessed with preprocedure cystoscopy and/or TRUS. 
Options used in the two centers included either intravenous 
sedation or prostate block followed by posttreatment anal-
gesics. Oral sedation only had been used predominantly for 
anesthesia in previous clinical trials.9,10
BPH procedures with the Rezūm system
Convective RF thermal therapy with the Rezūm system is 
performed with the patient in the dorsal lithotomy position; 
the treatment device is inserted into the urethra. Confirma-
tion of the contours of the prostate and planned disbursement 
of thermal lesions as derived from baseline cystoscopy is 
an appropriate first pass. Examination of the bladder and 
specifically the ureteral orifices is important, particularly in 
the event that median-lobe tissue has elevated the orifice. 
Treatment begins with the needle tip visually positioned 
and inserted from approximately 1 cm distally to the blad-
der neck. It is suggested to complete all treatments on one 
side of the gland, in order to take advantage of the latent 
heat from prior treatments on that side, and then proceed to 
treat tissue on the contralateral side of the gland. Multiple 
thermal treatments are delivered with the retractable vapor 
needle, which penetrates a fixed 10.25 mm into the prostatic 
tissue. Each treatment delivers approximately 208 calories of 
thermal energy by converting 0.42 mL of sterile water into 
vapor thermal energy with the application of RF current to 
the inductive coil within the device. The treatment needle 
has a total of 12 small emitter holes spaced around its tip at 
120° intervals to allow circumferential dispersion of thermal 
Figure 1 Rezūm delivery device and vapor needle.
Note: The vapor needle resides within the insulated lumen of the delivery device 
until it is deployed into the prostate tissue.

energy to create an approximate 1.5–2 cm lesion that remains 
confined within the anatomical zones of the prostate. A con-
tinuous saline (room temperature)-flush irrigation through the 
device lumen enhances visualization and cools the urethral 
surface to preserve the urethral lining.
Prostate adenomas in the transition and central zones can 
be precisely targeted. Any intravesical prostatic protrusions 
of either lateral or median lobes are injected from 1 cm from 
the proximal edge of the protrusion. This is an important 
point, as intravesical protrusions can be accurately and 
effectively targeted, which makes the Rezūm system unique 
as a minimally invasive procedure. Median-lobe treatments 
entail angulation of the treatment needle at 45° medially into 
the tissue. The treatment needle is retracted after each treat-
ment and repositioned in 1 cm increments distally from the 
previous site to the end of the prostatic tissue just proximal 
to the verumontanum. The objective of the treatment is to 
create contiguous, overlapping lesions running parallel to 
the natural slope of the urethra, hence prior “mapping” of 
the prostate is important. Both preprocedure cystoscopy and 
TRUS help to “map” or plan the ideal treatment for the best 
outcomes. The total number of treatments in each lobe of 
the prostate is determined by the length of the hypertrophied 
prostatic tissue, and can be customized to the configuration 
of the gland including the median lobe.
Data analysis
Data analysis was performed by a biostatistician at an inde-
pendent medical research organization. Descriptive statistics 
were used to describe baseline and postoperative follow-up 
values for all study variables, and data are presented as means, 
SD, mean changes, 95% CIs. For each outcome measure, the 
paired change from baseline to follow-up visits at 1, 3–6, and 
12 months after Rezūm thermal therapy was analyzed with 
descriptive statistics and also with a longitudinal general 
estimation-equation model using an exchangeable working 
correlation structure. This model was used to assess the sta-
tistical significance of changes from baseline, as this method 
takes into account the correlation within a subject over time 
and uses that information to adjust the standard error of the 
estimates.15 Significance was determined by a P-value less 
than 0.05. Analysis also included the proportion of patients 
with a change in IPSS that met a clinically meaningful 
threshold, defined by the American Urological Association 
as ≥3-point increase in IPSS relative to baseline.14 Patients 
meeting or exceeding this level of improvement are consid-
ered responders.
Results
A total of 131 consecutive patients were treated with Rezūm 
convective RF water-vapor thermal therapy by seven urolo-
gists in large group-community practices. Patient demograph-
ics were similar to those in prior published reports for pilot 
studies and RCTs.9,10,12 Some notable differences were appar-
ent compared to previous studies, including the older mean 
age of 70.9 (47–96) years, broader range of prostate volumes 
(mean 45.1 [12.9–183] cm3), and higher PVR volumes (mean 
216.6 [0–2,000] mL), with 26% of patients having a PVR 
volume >250 mL and three in retention (Table 1). Several 
patients (12%) had prior surgery or MIST procedure, includ-
ing transurethral resection of the prostate (three), transure-
thral conductive RF thermal therapy (nine), transurethral 
microwave thermal therapy (one), transurethral microwave 
thermal therapy and prostatic urethral lift (one), and Rezūm 
convective RF thermal therapy (two).
All treatments were successfully completed without 
perioperative device- or procedure-related adverse events. 
Procedures were performed with intravenous sedation (86%), 
general anesthesia (15%), or prostate block (6%). The total 
number of treatments in lateral lobes averaged 4.4 (range 
2–12). The median lobe and/or enlarged central zone was 
identified and treated in 54 patients (41%) of 131, with an 
average of 1.6 (range 1–6) treatments.
Nonserious, procedure-related adverse events and antici-
pated events included postoperative acute urinary retention

Convective radiofrequency thermal therapy for BPH
(10.7% [14 of 131]), and urinary frequency, urgency, frequency 
and urgency, hematuria, and nocturia in ≤3.8% of 131 patients. 
Adverse events were mild–moderate in severity, and most 
resolved within a short time after routine treatment or without 
treatment. Although this study did not collect sexual-function 
data via validated questionnaires, all patients were asked about 
sexual function, and there were no reports of de novo erectile or 
ejaculatory dysfunction. Three patients (2%) with obstructing 
residual tissue or insufficient improvement underwent a trans-
urethral resection of the prostate procedure 7–12 months later; 
one patient had a second Rezūm procedure 12 months later.
Observed outcomes for all patients at 1, 3–6, and 12 
months after thermal therapy are presented in Table 2. Three 
patients in retention did not have a baseline IPSS. Clinically 
significant relief of LUTS was observed with baseline IPSS 
reduced by 16%, 47%, and 45% at the three time-point evalu-
ations, respectively (P<0.0001). Mean baseline IPSS of 19.5 
decreased an average of 10.1 and 9.4 points at 3–6 months and 
12 months. Among these were 54 patients that had a median 
lobe/enlarged central zone treated. They were more likely to 
have ≥3-point improvement in IPSS (91.7% versus 75.4%, 
P=0.03) after treatment of this prostate tissue. Furthermore, 
the 23 patients with prostates ≥60 cm3 had a similar likeli-
hood of a meaningful clinical outcome of at least ≥3-point 
IPSS improvement compared with patients with prostates 
<60 cm3 (94.7% versus 78.9%, P=0.11). Significant improve-
ments in QOL and PVR volume were commensurate with 
IPSS improvements. IPSS improvements are also presented

Convective radiofrequency thermal therapy for BPH
in Figure 2, comparing outcomes of this postmarket study 
and replication of the profile of IPSS changes in a previous 
pilot study and RCT.
Because of the broad spectrum of LUTS severity, outcomes 
were further evaluated separately in patients with moderate 
(IPSS 8–19) or severe (IPSS 20–35) LUTS, as shown in 
Table 2. Both severity groups were similar in size. In both 
LUTS-severity cohorts, convective RF water-vapor thermal 
therapy showed clinically and statistically significant improve-
ments in IPSS, QOL, and PVR volume from 3 to 12 months 
(P<0.0001), and as early as 1 month for some variables. No 
earlier follow-up visits were conducted to determine the earli-
est time to response, as not all patients returned for all visits. 
Urinary flow rate was infrequently repeated. A significant 
reduction of 6.1 points in IPSS (40.1%) was achieved in the 
moderate LUTS cohort at 3–6 months, continuing with a 
40.6% reduction through 12 months from a mean IPSS baseline 
of 14.3 (P<0.0001). In the severe LUTS cohort, a reduction of 
14.4 points in IPSS (54.7%) from baseline was evident at 3–6 
months, continuing to 12 months with a 13.4-point IPSS reduc-
tion (50.4%) from a mean IPSS baseline of 25.5 (P<0.0001).
The number of individual patients achieving a mean-
ingful clinical improvement is presented in Figure 3. The 
criterion for improvement was defined as ≥3-point decrease

in IPSS.13 At 3–6 months after convective RF water-vapor 
thermal therapy, 73% of patients with moderate and 91% 
with severe LUTS had meaningful symptom relief. At 12 
months, the relief continued in 76% and 85% of moderate 
and severe LUTS patients, respectively. The comparison of 
percentage of patients with moderate LUTS and those with 
severe LUTS was not significantly different at the 3–6-month 
and 12-month evaluations in either moderate LUTS (P=0.48) 
or severe LUTS (P=0.32) patients.
Observed IPSS values of ≥3 points at each clinic visit for 
all evaluable patients are shown in Figure 4. After thermal 
therapy, significant symptomatic relief was achieved in both 
LUTS-severity groups. The IPSS outcomes achieved at 3–6 
months were sustained throughout 12 months. No significant 
differences were noted between these evaluation time points 
for patients with moderate LUTS (P=0.37) or severe LUTS 
(P=0.21). Logistic regression analysis examined the prob-
ability of patients achieving meaningful symptom relief after 
convective RF thermal therapy with the Rezūm system when 
the procedure was performed at the two urology centers or 
among the participating surgeons. The outcomes were not 
significantly different, indicative of the reproducibility of the 
therapeutic approach among patients with a wide spectrum 
of clinical conditions.

Discussion
The current data represent the first report of pooled accrued, 
consecutive cases of BPH treatments with the Rezūm system 
performed in two large community-group urology practices 
following commercial availability of convective RF water-
vapor thermal therapy. Before FDA clearance, RCTs provided 
guidelines and expectations within designated and restric-
tive enrollment and exclusion criteria.9,10,12 However, the 
Figure 2 IPSS improvements shown for all treated patients throughout 12 months after convective RF thermal therapy in this postmarket study.
Notes: These outcomes are compared with IPSS changes from the previously published pilot study9 and RCT10 showing similarity and durability of improvements in the 
three Rezūm system studies. Values are means, and error bars represent 95% CIs. IPSS improvements relative to baseline significant at all time points (P<0.001/P<0.0001).

real-world application of the Rezūm system for treatment of 
LUTS/BPH adds another level of important clinical scrutiny. 
Compared to patients enrolled in previous trials, the cohort 
of patients in this retrospective analysis included a cross-
section of patients with greater variability, many who were 
older with large prostates and some with previous invasive 
and MIST treatments or long-term use of BPH medications, 
yet continued bothersome urinary symptoms. This report

Convective radiofrequency thermal therapy for BPH
also presents the first postmarket application for patients 
with prostates larger than 80 (80–183) cm3, all done without 
adverse events and with successful outcomes. Procedural 
details based on the experiences of the seven urologists offer 
valuable insights for patient selection, application to prostate 
zones, including the median lobe or elevated bladder neck in 
central-zone hyperplasia, and intraoperative techniques help-
ful to clinicians new to this efficient and versatile procedure.
The results of this study showed sustained improvements 
in urinary symptoms, QOL, and PVR volume through 1 year 
of follow-up. No adverse events related to sexual function 
were reported. The significant relief and profile of IPSS 
improvements reproduced and mirrored the responses to 
convective RF thermal therapy when compared with the pilot 
trial and RCT.13 The outcomes were also reproducible when 
comparing patients treated at two large urology groups. These 
observations further support the use of convective RF ther-
mal therapy in traditional community clinical practices that 
encompass patients with considerable variability in LUTS/
BPH. Differences in IPSS after treatment are known to be

powerfully influenced by patient baseline scores.16 Accord-
ingly, the evaluations based on LUTS severity showed that 
patients with either moderate (IPSS 8–19) or severe (IPSS 
20–35) both achieved significantly improved scores.
All procedures were performed in an office or outpatient 
treatment setting. The majority of patients at these two 
sites were managed with intravenous conscious sedation. 
Management of pain and anxiety was at the discretion of 
the clinician and his or her standard of practice; no specific 
anesthesia has been suggested or required for this proce-
dure. In the RCT, anesthesia was variable: 69% received 
oral sedation only, 10% intravenous sedation, and 21% a 
prostate block.
An inherent limitation of this study, unlike an RCT, is 
that follow-up times were not tightly controlled, nor inclu-
sion criteria standardized. While considered a limitation, the 
patients treated and patterns of evaluation reflected those in 
a typical urologic practice. Unlike an RCT, patients did not 
present for treatment with a commitment to a protocol or a 
sense of altruism.

In conclusion, we believe this study highlights the merits 
of using convective RF water-vapor thermal therapy for rapid 
and durable relief of LUTS due to BPH. The thermal energy 
is contained within the zonal boundaries of the prostate 
glandular anatomy without compromising the integrity of the 
urinary sphincter, bladder, or rectum.17 Convective RF ther-
mal therapy using the Rezūm system provides versatility for 
application to a variety of prostate-gland morphologies. The 
reproducibility of outcomes among the participating urolo-
gists in their practices and corroboration of results with prior 
clinical trials are important in meeting our expectations to 
provide the best care for our patients. For many symptomatic 
men, convective RF water-vapor thermal therapy will be an 
appropriate and low-risk treatment in the continuum between 
medical management and more invasive surgical approaches. 
The unique therapeutic modality warrants consideration for 
a first-line treatment for LUTS/BPH.
