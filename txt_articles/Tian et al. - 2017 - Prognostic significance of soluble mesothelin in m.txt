ABSTRACT
Background: Soluble mesothelin is beneficial to detect the progression and the 
treatment response of malignant pleural mesothelioma. However, the prognostic 
value of soluble mesothelin in malignant pleural mesothelioma remains unclear.
Methods: Hazard ratio with 95% CI was used to evaluate the prognostic value of 
soluble mesothelin and the effect of clinicopathological characteristics on the survival 
of malignant pleural mesothelioma.
Results: Eight eligible studies involving 579 patients were selected for this meta-
analysis. The results showed that soluble mesothelin level was significantly correlated 
with the survival of malignant pleural mesothelioma (pooled HR: 1.958, 95%CI: 
1.531-2.504, p = 0.000; heterogeneity test: I2 = 1.1%, p = 0.421). In addition, the 
survival of malignant pleural mesothelioma was significantly correlated with some 
clinicopathological characteristics such as tumor histology (HR = 3.214, 95% CI = 
2.071-4.988, p = 0.000; heterogeneity test: I2 = 0.0%, p = 0.623) and tumor stage (HR 
= 2.007; 95% CI = 1.477-2.727; p = 0.000; heterogeneity test: I2 = 0.0%, p = 0.966).
Conclusions: The survival of malignant pleural mesothelioma is significantly 
correlated with tumor histology and tumor stage. Furthermore, high soluble mesothelin 
level may lead to a poor prognosis for malignant pleural mesothelioma patients.
INTRODUCTION
Malignant pleural mesothelioma(MPM) is a rare but 
highly aggressive asbestos-induced malignancy, with a poor 
prognosis and increasing incidence [1]. Although the surgery 
and combination chemotherapy are proved effective, the 
median overall survival of MPM remains poor [2]. Therefore, 
it is necessary to identify prognostic markers to help with 
the survival of MPM. Mesothelin is a 40 kDa cell surface 
glycoprotein, and highly expressed in several human cancers, 
including mesotheliomas, pancreatic cancers and ovarian 
cancers [3]. Although mesothelin bounds to cell membrane, 
a circulating form termed soluble mesothelin can be detected 
in the blood and pleural effusion by using enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [4]. Soluble mesothelin is a 
useful biomarker, which can not only play an important role 
in the diagnosis [5, 6], but also be beneficial to monitor the 
progression and treatment response of MPM [7]. Recently, 
some studies have reported that high soluble mesothelin 
level can be considered as a negative prognostic factor in 
patients with MPM [8-12]. On the other hand, some studies 
show that the prognostic value of soluble mesothelin in 
MPM is not conclusive and needs further evaluation [13-15]. 
Despite numerous published studies, the prognostic value 
of soluble mesothelin remains controversial. Additionally, 
the correlation between the survival of MPM patients and 
clinicpathological characteristics such as age, gender, tumor 
histology and tumor stage are uncertain. To evaluate the 
prognostic value of soluble mesothelin and the effect of

clinicopathological characteristics on the survival of MPM 
patients, we performed a meta-analysis.
RESULTS
Characteristics of eligible studies
A total of 1285 records were identified through 
database searching. Six hundred and twelve records were 
excluded for duplication. After browsing the titles and 
abstracts, 16 studies that might meet the inclusion criteria 
were screened out to read full texts. These studies were 
carefully reviewed. Finally, 8 eligible studies including 579 
patients were selected for this meta-analysis (Figure 1). 
The characteristics of eligible studies were summarized 
in Table 1. The size of sample in each study ranged from 
36 to 107 and all of the patients were Caucasian. The 
most common tumor site of the patients was pleural. The 
mestothelin level was tested using serum specimen in 7 
studies. In the rest 1 study, the samples were from pleural 
effusion. Two Mesomark ELISA kits (Mesomark kit by 
Fujirebio Diagnostics, Malvern, Pennsylvania, USA or by 
Cisbio International, Gif-Sur-Yvette, France) were used in 
eligible studies to measure mesothelin level. The mesothelin 
level was expressed in nanomoles per liter (nmol/L) in the 
eligible studies. Six studies provided available HR with 
95%CI. The other 2 studies had their HRs and 95%CIs 
calculated from Kaplan- Meier survival curves.
Prognostic impact of soluble mesothelin in MPM
The main meta-analysis results, the correlation 
between soluble mesothelin and the survival of MPM, were 
summarized in Figure 2. The pooled HR for all eligible 
studies which evaluated soluble mesothelin in MPM patients 
was 1.958 (95%CI 1.531-2.504). The results showed that 
high soluble mesothelin level was statistically significant 
correlated with the overall survival of MPM (p = 0.000) 
with a low heterogeneity (I2 = 1.1%, p = 0.421). To detect 
the potential heterogeneity, subgroup analysis stratified by 
specimen type, cut-off value, sample size, source of HR and 
survival analysis mode were applied. The results of subgroup 
analysis indicated that patients with high soluble mesothelin 
level had poorer overall survival compared with patients with 
low soluble mesothelin level in the following subgroups: 
serum subgroup (HR = 2.016; 95% CI =1.571-2.588; p = 
0.000), cut-off value <5 subgroup (HR = 1.980; 95% CI = 
1.516-2.586; p = 0.000), sample size <50 subgroup (HR = 
4.970; 95% CI = 1.633- 15.131; p = 0.005), sample size ≥50 
subgroup (HR = 1.866; 95% CI = 1.450- 2.402; p = 0.000), 
HR reported subgroup (HR = 2.016; 95% CI = 1.569-2.591; 
p = 0.000), multivariate analysis subgroup (HR = 1.925; 
95% CI = 1.466-2.528; p = 0.000), non-multivariate analysis 
subgroup (HR = 2.111; 95% CI = 1.188-3.752; p = 0.011). 
The results of subgroup analysis revealed some possible 
contributors to the heterogeneity: sample size, specimen type, 
source of HR and survival analysis mode. The detailed results 
of subgroup analysis were summarized in Table 2.
Correlation between clinicopathological 
characteristics and the survival of MPM
The main meta-analysis results of the correlation 
between clinicopathological characteristics and the 
survival of MPM patients were summarized in Table 3. The 
clinicopathological characteristics included age, gender, 
tumor histology and tumor stage. The results showed 
that not all the clinicopathologicl characteristics were 
significantly correlated with the survival of MPM patients. 
The pooled HR for age, gender, tumor histology and tumor 
stage were, respectively, 1.256(95% CI =0.907-1.739; p = 
0.170), 0.932(95% CI =0.168-5.17; p = 0.936), 3.214(95% 
CI = 2.071-4.988; p = 0.000), 2.007(95% CI = 1.477-2.727; 
p = 0.000). No significant correlations were found between 
the survival of MPM patients and age or gender. However, 
tumor histology and tumor stage were significantly related 
to the survival of MPM patients with no heterogeneity.
Sensitivity analysis and publication bias
Sensitivity analysis was used to estimate the influence 
by omitting one study at a time and calculate the combined 
HR. The result indicated that no individual study had a 
significant influence on the observed effect size (pooled 
HR) for overall survival (Figure 3). Begg’s funnel plot with 
pseudo 95 % confidence limits was performed to estimate the 
publication bias of the eight studies included about overall 
survival (Figure 4). There was no significant publication 
bias observed with the Begg’s tests of overall survival (p = 
0.711). To validate the result, the nonparametric trim and fill 
method was further used to evaluate the impact of this bias 
and the pooled HR for overall survival. The results indicated 
no significant publication bias among studies and the pooled 
HR remained significant. Collectively, the result of this meta-
analysis was robust and statistically reliable.
DISCUSSION
To our best knowledge, this meta-analysis is the 
first study to evaluate the prognostic value of soluble 
mesothelin and effect of clinicopathological characteristics 
on the survival of MPM patients.
Mesothelin was firstly studied as a prognostic 
indicator in MPM by Cristaudo et al. [8], who reported 
a significant inverse correlation between mesothelin level 
and the overall survival of MPM. Grigoriu et al. [9] also 
found high mesothelin level was negatively correlated 
with the survival of MPM patients in both univariate 
and multivariate analysis. Another study, conducted 
by Yamada et al. [16], indicated that pleural effusion 
mesothelin level also had a prognostic effect the survival 
of MPM patients. However, in two studies conducted

by Hollevoet et al. [17, 18], finding serum mesothelin 
was not an effective predictor for the survival of MPM 
patients. By the result of our meta-analysis, we found that 
high mesothelin level is a negative prognostic factor for 
MPM patients. Moreover, in the subgroup analysis, which 
survival analysis was conducted by multivariate analysis, 
the high mesothelin level was still significantly related to 
the survival of MPM patients. Data above indicated that 
mesothelin might be an independent prognostic factor in 
MPM patients. In addition, some clinicopathdological 
characteristics such as age, gender, tumor histology and 
tumor stage were also reported to have prognostic effects 
on the survival of MPM Patients. Recent studies showed 
old age, male gender, non-epithelioid histology and 
advanced tumor stage were significantly related to poor 
survival of MPM patients [19-22]. The results of our meta-

analysis indicated that the survival of MPM patients was 
significantly correlated with tumor histology and tumor 
stage, which suggested that non-epithelioid histology and 
advanced tumor stage were significant negative predictors 
of the survival in MPM patients. However, neither age 
nor gender was found to be significantly related with the 
survival of MPM patients in our meta-analysis. There are 
some other independent prognostic factors proposed for 
MPM patients, such as white blood cell count, C-reactive 
protein level, hemoglobin level, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte 
ratio, lactate dehydrogenase, performance status, 
comorbidity, weight loss and breathlessness [20, 23-26]. 
Moreover, the therapies also contributed to the survival 
of MPM patients. Patients treated with chemotherapy had 
significantly longer survival than those treated with best 
supportive care [26]. Chemotherapy and radiation to port 
sites independently and in combination were associated 
with improved overall survival in MPM patients [27]. 
Absence of adjuvant therapy and non-curative surgery 
were significantly related to poor survival [19].

The mechanisms responsible for the association 
between high mesothelin level and poor survival of MPM 
patients remain unclear. More and more studies have 
showed that soluble mesothein level was closely associated 
with disease progression, disease status and tumor burden 
[17, 28, 29]. Additionally, Mesothelin contributes to 
further understanding of the biology of MPM, because 
it participates in cell adherence, cell proliferation and

tumor invasion of MPM [30, 31]. Mesothelin is a suitable 
candidate for drug therapy and a potential target for 
designing novel therapeutic strategies [32]. Recent studies 
have indicated that antimesothelin immunotoxins, such 
as SS1P and RG7787, are well tolerated and exhibits 
significant antitumor activity in patients with MPM [33, 
34]. Amatuximab is tolerable in MPM patients with a 
disease control rate of 90% when given with pemetrexed 
and cisplatin [35, 36]. The exposure of amatuximab is 
associated with overall survival, higher amatuximab 
exposure accompanied with longer overall survival [37]. 
Mesothelin gene silencing has an antitumor effect on cell 
lines overexpressing mesothelin deriving from MPM, 
which means mesothelin could be considered as a key 
molecular target for novel gene-based targeted therapies 
of MPM [38]. Collectively, mesothelin participates in cell 
adherence, cell proliferation, tumor invasion of MPM, 
and plays an important role in monitoring the treatment 
response, the disease progression and the prognosis in 
MPM patients. Mesothelin is also a suitable potential 
target for drug therapy.
There are some limitations in this meta-analysis. 
Firstly, both the number of included studies and the 
simple size of each study were relatively small. Secondly, 
not all of the HRs with 95% CI were directly extracted 
from the studies, the reconstructed HR calculated via 
Kaplan-Meier survival curves unavoidably brought some 
unexpected errors. Thirdly, the ethnicities of the patients 
in our analysis were Caucasian, there might be ethnic 
bias existed. Fourthly, not all of the survival analyses of 
the eligible studies were conducted by the multivariate 
analysis, there might be some confounding factors existed. 
Fifth, though no significant heterogeneity among studies 
was found in our study, we could not fully neglect the 
potential heterogeneity. The subgroup analysis was used 
to assess the sources of heterogeneity. The results of 
subgroup analysis revealed that sample size, specimen 
type, source of HR and survival analysis mode might 
contribute to the heterogeneity. Therefore, more eligible 
studies are needed to explore the sources of heterogeneity. 
Moreover, the stability of our results was confirmed by 
sensitivity analysis.
In conclusion, the survival of MPM is significantly 
correlated with tumor histology and tumor stage. Furthermore, 
high soluble mesothelin level may lead to a poor prognosis for 
MPM patients. Therefore, it is appropriate to regard soluble 
mesothelin as an independent prognostic marker and a novel 
potential therapeutic target for MPM patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This meta-analysis was performed according to the 
statement of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) [39].
Search strategy
Two investigators independently searched the Medline 
(via OvidSP), Embase(via OvidSP), COCENTRAL and 
Pubmed for studies that investigated the prognosis with 
soluble mesothelin in MPM. Studies were examined, and 
an updated search was conducted on November 2016. The 
search terms were as follows: mesothelin and mesothelioma. 
The title and abstract of each identified study were browsed 
to exclude any irrelevant publications. The full texts of 
all potentially eligible studies were retrieved, and their 
references were carefully browsed to find other studies that 
met the criteria. Disagreements between two investigators 
were settled by discussion.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Studies eligible for inclusion in this meta-analysis met 
the following criteria: (1) evaluated the prognostic value of 
soluble mesothelin, either in blood or pleural effusion(PE); 
(2) soluble mesothelin level was divided into high and low 
grades; (3) the literature should be published with full texts. 
Exclusion criteria included: (1) articles published as reviews, 
conference abstracts or comments;(2) studies with insufficient 
survival data for which HR and CI could not be determined;
Data extraction and quality assessment
Two investigators extracted useful information from 
eligible studies independently. The following information 
was recorded: first author surname, publication year, 
country, study type, number of patients, ethnicity, tumor 
site, tumor histology, tumor stage, treatment, specimen, 
method, cut-off value, source of HR (95% CI), survival 
analysis mode. Hazard ratio was the most appropriate 
statistic to analyze time-to-event outcomes, because both 
the number of events and time of events were taken into 
account. When the HR with 95% was available from the 
original article, we used the data directly. Otherwise we 
extracted data from the Kaplan-Meier survival curves 
by the software Engauge Digitizer Version 4.1 (http://
digitizer.sourceforge.net/). The method proposed by 
Tierney et al. was used to calculated the HR and 95%CI 
[40]. When both univariate and multivariate analysis were 
conducted in the studies, we preferred the results based 
on multivariate analysis. Disagreements were settled 
by discussion. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was 
used to evaluate the quality of each individual study 
[41]. The NOS consists of three parameters of quality: 
selection (there terms: representativeness of the exposed 
cohort, selection of the non exposed cohort, selection of 
the non exposed cohort, demonstration that outcome of 
interest was not present at start of study?), comparability 
(one term: comparability of cohorts on the basis of the 
design or analysis), and outcome assessment (three terms: 
assessment of outcome, was follow-up long enough for 
outcomes to occur? adequacy of follow up of cohorts). 
The NOS score was ranged from 0 to 9, and the study with 
an NOS score ≥ 6 was considered as a high quality study.
Statistical analysis
Hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI was performed 
to estimate the prognostic value of soluble mesothelin 
and the effect of clinicopathological characteristics on 
the survival of MPM patients. Cochrane’s Q test (Chi-
squared test) and I2 metric were performed to calculate 
the statistical heterogeneity of the pooled HR with 95% 
CI [42]. For I2 statistics, I2<25% indicates there is a 
low heterogeneity, I2= 25%-50% indicates there is a 
moderate heterogeneity and I2 >50% indicates there is 
a significant heterogeneity [43]. The fixed-effect model 
was adopted in the meta-analysis when no statistically 
significant heterogeneity was observed between studies 
(p≥0.1 or I2 <50%), otherwise the random-effect model 
was used. When HR >1, a poor prognosis for MPM 
patients was indicated by high soluble mesothelin 
level. If there was no overlap between 95% CI and 
1, it would be considered that the impact of soluble 
mesothein on survival was statistically significant. 
Subgroup analysis was stratified by specimen type, 
cut-off value, sample size, source of HR and survival 
analysis mode. The sensitivity analysis was performed 
using the leave-one-out method to explore the influence 
of each individual study on the pooled HR for overall 
survival. Publication bias was evaluated by funnel 
plot(qualitative) and Begg’s test(quantitative). When 
publication bias existed, the nonparametric trim and 
fill method was applied to re-estimate a corrected effect 
size after adjustment for publication bias [44]. All p 
values were based on two-sided test, p value < 0.05 was 
considered to be statistically significant. STATA 11.0 
software (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX) was 
used to conduct all statistical analysis.
