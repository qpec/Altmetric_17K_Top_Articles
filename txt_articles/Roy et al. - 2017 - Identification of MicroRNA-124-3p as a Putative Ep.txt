Major depressive disorder (MDD) is predicted to be the second leading cause of global disease burden by 2030. A large number of MDD
patients do not respond to the currently available medication because of its poorly understood etiology. Recently, studies of microRNAs
(miRNAs), which act as a molecular switch of gene expression, have shown promise in identifying a molecular network that could provide
significant clues to various psychiatric illnesses. Using an in vitro system, a rodent depression model, and a human postmortem brain, we
investigated the role of a brain-enriched, neuron-specific miRNA, miR-124-3p, whose expression is highly dysregulated in stressed rodents,
and identified a set of target genes involved in stress response and neural plasticity. We also found that miR-124-3p is epigenetically
regulated and its interaction with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) is compromised in MDD. Using blood serum, we found
similar dysregulation of miR-124-3p in antidepressant-free MDD subjects. Altogether, our study demonstrates potential contribution of
miR-124-3p in the pathophysiology of MDD and suggests that this miRNA may serve as a novel target for drug development and a
biomarker for MDD pathogenesis.

INTRODUCTION
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating disorder
that leads to significant increase in morbidity and mortality
(Belmaker and Agam, 2008; Bromet et al, 2011). A large
number of MDD patients do not respond to the currently
available medication (Warden et al, 2007; Labermaier et al,
2013). This is partially the result of a lack of understanding of
the molecular circuitry underlying MDD.
It is becoming increasingly clear that disruptions across
cellular networks and aberrant information processing in the
circuits that regulate mood and cognition may lead to altered
synaptic and structural plasticity and may be crucial in the
development of MDD (Malki et al, 2015). In this context,
microRNAs (miRNAs), a prominent class of small non-
coding RNAs, are gaining increasing attention for their role
in neural plasticity and higher brain functioning (Scott et al,
2012; Hansen et al, 2013). These miRNAs function as the
master regulator of gene expression at a post-transcriptional
level either by modulating the mRNA
translation or
transcript
degradation by targeting the 3′-untranslated
region (UTR); (Kim, 2005; Valencia-Sanchez et al, 2006).
Gene expression regulation by miRNAs has recently been
considered to be a significant contributor to the under-
standing of the pathophysiology of psychiatric illnesses. This
is evident from studies demonstrating altered expression of
miRNAs in the brain of MDD (Smalheiser et al, 2011;
Smalheiser et al, 2012; Lopez et al, 2014), schizophrenia
(Smalheiser et al, 2014; Lai et al, 2016), as well as bipolar
disorder (Smalheiser et al, 2014; Walker et al, 2015) patients.
How these miRNAs contribute to these psychiatric illnesses,
however, is not well understood. Recently, we reported that a
set of miRNAs were coordinately and cohesively regulated in
the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of MDD subjects, which were
distinct
from
control
group
(Smalheiser
et
al,
2011;
Smalheiser et al, 2014). In order to understand whether
stress has a role in this coordinated regulation, recently we
examined the effects of chronic exogenous corticosterone
(CORT) administration to rats in inducing depression-like
behavior and miRNA expression in PFC (Dwivedi et al,
2015). We found that CORT administration significantly
increased immobility time and reduced the percentage of
sucrose consumption compared with the vehicle control rats.
On the other hand, there was no significant difference
between chronic CORT-treated and vehicle-treated groups in
total lines crossed during open-field test. When miRNA
expression was examined in PFC of CORT-treated rats, we
found that miRNAs had a coordinated dysregulation and a
close chromosomal localization pattern, indicating their
possible roles in fine tuning the outcome of the stress-
induced depression phenotype. Interestingly, when exam-
ined individually, it was found that miR-124-3p was one of

 the most significantly affected miRNAs in CORT-treated
rats. This brain-enriched (Sempere et al, 2004) miRNA is
neuron-specific (Smirnova et al, 2005; Makeyev et al, 2007;
Jovicic et al, 2013) and has been linked to synaptic plasticity
(Chandrasekar and Dreyer, 2009; Fischbach and Carew,
2009) and antidepressant activity (Bahi et al, 2014).
In the present study we examined the relevance of
miR-124-3p in MDD pathogenesis by investigating the
following: (1) miR-124-3p-mediated regulation of putative
target gene transcripts relevant to stress and synaptic
plasticity; (2) endogenous binding status of miR-124-3p
with target genes in vivo; (3) locus-specific origin of
miR-124-3p; (4) epigenetic modulation of miR-124-3p; (5)
miR-124-3p expression in PFC of individuals with MDD
diagnosis vs normal controls; and (6) miR-124-3p expression
in serum of MDD patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
All studies were approved by the Animal Care Committee
and Institutional Review Board of the University of Alabama
at Birmingham.
Animals and CORT Injections
The study was conducted in the PFC of vehicle (n = 10) and
CORT-treated
(50 mg/kg;
intraperitoneal
injections
for
21 days; n = 9) rats. Rats were decapitated, trunk blood was
collected, and brains were dissected 24 h after the last CORT
injection between 0900 and 1100 hours as outlined earlier
(Dwivedi et al, 2015). The CORT levels in serum were as
follows:
vehicle,
59.12 ± 11.30
and
CORT-treated,
123.87 ± 16.59 (F = 2.31, df = 14, po0.001).
Human Postmortem Brain Samples
The study was performed in the PFC (Brodmann’s area 46)
obtained from depressed subjects who died from causes
other than suicide (n = 15) and control subjects without a
history of mental disorder (n = 15), hereafter referred to as
normal controls. Brain tissues were obtained from the
Maryland Brain Collection at the Maryland Psychiatric
Research Center, Baltimore, MD. The brain dissection
method is provided in our earlier publication (Dwivedi
et al, 2006). All tissues from normal controls and depressed
subjects were screened for evidence of neuropathology by
experienced neuropathologists and were excluded if they
exhibited features of Alzheimer’s disease, infarctions, de-
myelinating diseases, or atrophy (or clinical history of these
disorders). Toxicology and presence of antidepressants were
examined by analysis of urine and blood samples from these
subjects. pH of the brain was measured as described by
Harrison et al (1995).
The psychiatric diagnosis was determined by psychological
autopsy as described earlier (Dwivedi et al, 2006) using
Diagnostic Evaluation After Death (DEAD) (Salzman et al,
1983) and the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV
(SCID) (Spitzer et al, 1995). Normal controls were verified as
free from mental illnesses using the same diagnostic
procedures.
Fluoxetine Treatment to Rats
To evaluate the effects of antidepressants on miR-124-3p
expression, male Sprague–Dawley rats were treated with
fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal for 60 days; n = 5) or
normal saline (n = 5). Twenty-four hours after the last
injection, brains were dissected and the expression of
miR-124-3p was determined in PFC.
Patient Population
This study was performed in 17 healthy controls and 18
MDD patients. All participants were evaluated using the
Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (Sheehan
et al, 1998) or the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-
IV TR (SCID) (First et al, 2002), with a second confirmatory
interview by another psychiatrist. Depression severity was
determined
using
the
Montgomery–Åsberg
Depression
Rating Scale (Montgomery and Asberg, 1979).
Patients with any of the following characteristics were
excluded: history of bipolar or any psychotic disorder, or the
use of lithium or an antipsychotic within the prior 2 weeks;
substance-use
disorder
within
3
months;
uncontrolled
clinically significant medical illnesses including the initiation
of any new medications within 30 days; and pregnancy or
lactation. Other psychiatric comorbidities were allowed as
long as the MDD was considered primary. All MDD patients
were psychotropic drug-free for at least 1 month before
blood sampling. Healthy controls had no lifetime history of
any mental disorder and were excluded for any uncontrolled
clinically significant medical illnesses including the initiation
of any new medications within 30 days, pregnancy, or
lactation. Venous blood was collected between 0900 and
1100 hours and immediately processed for serum isolation.
Serum was stored at − 80 oC for further RNA extraction.
RNA Isolation from Brain Tissues and Blood Serum
Total RNA from rat and human PFC was isolated following
TRIzol method (Invitrogen, Grandsland, NY, USA) with
slight modifications as described earlier (Smalheiser et al,
2011). RNA samples were screened based on their purity
(260/280 nm; cutoff ⩾ 1.8) and integrity (based on agarose gel
electrophoresis). Only samples showing RNA integrity
number 47 were used.
RNA was extracted from human serum samples following
the TRIzol method with few modifications. Briefly, 200 μl
serum was mixed with 50 μl of nuclease-free water before
TRIzol addition (750 μl), followed by overnight precipitation
with alcohol with 40 μg of glycogen as co-precipitant.
First Strand cDNA Synthesis and qPCR-Based
Transcript Quantification
Relative quantification of transcripts was done following the
synthesis of the first strand cDNA using 1 μg of total RNA.
Briefly, mRNA pool was selectively reverse-transcribed using
oligo dT-based priming method. miRNA-specific first strand
cDNA conversion was performed following a poly A tailing
method and subsequent priming with oligo dT adopter
primer (Supplementary Table S1).
Relative transcript abundance for both mRNA and miRNA
was
determined
using
EvaGreen
chemistry
(Applied
miR-124-3p and major depression
B Roy et al
865
Neuropsychopharmacology
 Biological Material, Richmond, Canada) as described earlier
(Dwivedi et al, 2015) following a delta delta Ct method
(Livak and Schmittgen, 2001). The detailed primer sequence
information is provided in Supplementary Table S1. Relative
mRNA quantification was carried out using GAPDH as the
normalizer, whereas U6 was used as normalizer for relative
miRNA quantification. Both these normalizers were not
significantly different in PFC of MDD subjects compared
with normal controls (GAPDH: t = 0.68, df = 28, p = 0.50;
U6: t = 1.61, df = 28, p = 0.12).
Luciferase Assay
Using rat genomic DNA (gDNA), Gria4 3′ UTR was PCR-
amplified with specific adaptor primers containing restric-
tion digestion sites for SpeI and HindIII (Supplementary
Table S1). Amplified 3′ UTR was double-digested (SpeI and
HindIII) and directionally cloned in pMIR luciferase reporter
vector (Addgene, Cambridge, MA, USA) (Supplementary
Table S1). The luciferase assay was performed by co-
transfecting HEK-293 cells (293 (HEK293; ATCC CRL1573)
with Gria4 3′ UTR containing pMIR plasmid in three different
combinations: with (i) miR-124-3p duplex, (ii) miR-124-3p
hairpin inhibitor duplex, and (iii) nonspecific miR duplex
(GE Healthcare Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO, USA) as negative
control. Simultaneous transfection of Renilla Luciferase
plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) in all three groups
was carried out to analyze normalized (firefly/Renilla)
luciferase activity in relative luminescence units.
Transfection Assay
Double-stranded RNA oligos, mimicking endogenous miR-
124-3p, antisense of miR-124-3p, and nonspecific miRNA
control were transfected into SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell
lines (SHSY5Y ATCC CRL2266). One group of control was
included in the experiment as vehicle where cells were
incubated with transfection reagent devoid of any RNA
oligos. Cells were harvested 36 h after transfection for target
mRNA expression analysis.
RNA-Immunoprecipitation Assay
Rat PFC (20 mg) was homogenized using polysome lysis
buffer for RNA-Immunoprecipitation (RNP-IP) assay fol-
lowing a protocol by Keene et al (2006) with slight
modifications. Briefly, prewashed protein A/G beads (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) were conjugated with
Ago1 monoclonal antibody (Catalogue number: 07-599;
Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and were added with clear
lysate derived from homogenized brain tissue. Following an
overnight incubation, the immunoprecipitated RNA-induced
silencing complex (RISC) was used to extract enriched
miRNAs and their bound target mRNAs using TRIzol
reagent.
First strand cDNA was reverse-transcribed from the
immunoprecipitated RNA using miRNA oligo seed sequence
(Supplementary Table S1). Amplified cDNA was used for
miRNA–mRNA interaction analysis following qPCR assay
with primer sets (Supplementary Table S1) intended for
target mRNA sequence close to the miRNA-binding site at
3′ UTR.
Methylated DNA Immunoprecipitation Assay for
pre-miR-124-3 Promoter Element
Promoter region of pre-miR-124-3, located 1 kb upstream of
the transcriptional unit on rat chromosome 3, was char-
acterized for CpG islands. Using an in silico tool, two
potential CpG islands were first mapped within 1 kb
upstream region of pre-miR-124-3 transcriptional unit and
then
analyzed
for
their
methylation
status
following
methylated
DNA
immunoprecipitation
(MeDIP)
assay.
Two micrograms of total gDNA isolated from rat PFC was
treated with RNaseA and sheared to generate a random
fragment length of ~ 400 bp. Fragmented gDNA was first
denatured and then was conjugated using Protein G
magnetic beads (EMD Millipore) and 5 μg monoclonal
5-methyl cytosine antibody (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA).
A portion of (10%) untreated sonicated denatured gDNA
was kept separately as input control. After reverse cross-
linking of immunoprecipitated complex, DNA was extracted
following phenol: chloroform: isoamylalcohol (25 : 24 : 1 V/
V) method. Finally, purified DNA was subjected to qPCR
using EvaGreen and primers designed to amplify CpG
islands (Supplementary Table S1). An unmethylated control
primer pair was used to determine the efficiency of
immunoenrichment protocol (Supplementary Table S1).
The methylation enrichment was analyzed after normal-
ization with input control.
miRNA-Specific First Strand cDNA Synthesis and qPCR
in RNA Isolated from Serum
Reverse transcription was primed on ‘poly A’-attached
transcripts
using
the
oligo
dT-Adapter
primer
(Supplementary Table S1) in 100 ng of total RNA. Relative
quantification of transcripts was carried out with prepared
first strand cDNA using SybrGreen (ThermoFisher Scien-
tific, Grand Island, NY, USA) chemistry to amplify selective
miRNA with specific forward primers and a universal
reverse primer (Supplementary Table S1).
Statistical Analysis
All data were analyzed using SPSS (IBM, Chicago, IL, USA).
The data are reported as the mean ± SEM. Various measures
between vehicle and CORT-treated rats were analyzed by
independent-sample ‘t’ test (confidence interval = 95%). The
relationships between target gene expression and miR-124-
3p in vehicle and CORT-treated groups were determined by
Pearson product–moment correlation analysis. The differ-
ences in the expression of target gene mRNA levels between
vehicle,
scramble,
mimic,
and
anti-miR-124-3p
and
luciferase-based Gria4 3′ UTR reporter assay between
scramble, mimic, and anti-miR-124-3p were analyzed by
one-way analysis of variance, followed by post hoc Tukey’s
multiple comparison test (Tukey’s HSD). The comparison of
locus-specific pre-miR-124 (miR-124-1, 124-2, 124-3) ex-
pression levels and expression of Dnmt1, 3a, and 3b between
vehicle
and
CORT-treated
groups
were
analyzed
by
independent-sample ‘t’ test. For human postmortem brain
analysis, the comparison of age, gender, brain pH, post-
mortem interval (PMI), and expression of miR-124-3p as
well as various target genes between control and MDD

 groups were analyzed by independent-sample ‘t’ test. The
correlation between miR-124-3p and target genes as well as
PMI, age, and brain pH were determined by Pearson
product–moment correlation analysis. The effects of anti-
depressants in human postmortem tissues were evaluated by
independent-sample ‘t’ test by comparing MDD subjects
who showed presence of antidepressant toxicology at the
time of death with those who did not. The two group
comparisons
(MDD
and
healthy
controls)
in
patient
population study was made using independent-sample ‘t’
test. Similarly, the effect of fluoxetine on miR-124-3p
expression
in
the
rat
brain
was
analyzed
using
independent-sample ‘t’ test. An α level ⩽ 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
RESULTS
Effect of Chronic CORT Administration in Rats on
Expression of miR-124-3p in PFC and its Impact on
Predicted Target Genes
As reported earlier (Dwivedi et al, 2015), one of the most
affected miRNAs in PFC of chronic CORT-administered rats
was
miR-124-3p,
which
showed
~ 1.8-fold
expression
upregulation. A similar pattern of upregulation (~1.6-fold)
was noted when miR-124-3p was re-analyzed in PFC of a
total of 10 vehicle controls and 9 CORT-treated rats
(Figure 1a). In silico prediction analysis based on TargetScan
(v.6 and 7) showed that this miRNA targets a large number
of genes (Supplementary Table S2). On the basis of high
context scores and strong presence of 7/8 mer canonical
binding motifs in the 3′ UTRs (Supplementary Table S3),
eight highly potential genes were found as target of miR-124-
3p whose functions were reported to be critical in brain
physiology in stress and MDD pathogenesis. These include
heat shock protein 90ab1 (Hsp90ab1), Akt1 substrate1
(Akt1s1), glucocorticoid receptor (Nr3c1), mineralocorticoid
receptor (Nr3c2), Gria3, Gria4 (members of AMPA receptor
family), and Grin2a and Grin2b (NMDA receptor family
members). All of these genes were downregulated in PFC of
CORT-treated rats; however, only Gria3, Gria4, Grin2a, and
Nr3c1 showed a statistically significant downregulation
(Figure 1b). Moreover, the expression profile of these genes
showed a pattern of inverse relationship with miR-124-3p
expression in the CORT-treated group (Figure 1c–f).
In silico Mapping and Characterization of 3′ UTR of
Target Genes for miR-124-3p-Binding Sites Across
Higher Vertebrates
Figure 2a–p shows the chromosomal localization, sequence
complementarity at the 3′ UTR, and the evolutionary
conservation of the miR-124-3p-binding site across higher
vertebrates, including placental mammals of four signifi-
cantly downregulated target genes (Gria3, Gria4, Grin2a, and
Nr3c1). In silico mapping of Grin2a and Nr3c1 transcripts
showed two miR-124-3p binding motifs at 3′ UTRs (Figure
2g and l), whereas Gria3 and Gria4 transcripts showed only
one binding motif (Figure 2a and d). Although the Gria4
3′ UTR-binding site for miR-124-3p was less evolutionarily
conserved across mammalian species than Gria3 (Figure 2a
and d), the transcription of Gria4 was more repressed than
Gria3 (Figure 1b). On the other hand, the level of
transcriptional repression for Grin2a and Nr3c1 was much
higher in the CORT-treated group than Gria3 and Gria4
(Figure 1b).
Validation of miR-124-3p-Mediated Repression on
Target Genes
Mir-124-3p overexpression in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell
line caused 23% downregulation in the expression of
endogenous GRIA4; however, the level of repression was
very close to attain the statistical significance. On the other
hand, a significant downregulation was found for NR3C1
(37% repression) and AKT1S1 (48% repression) when
miR-124-3p was ectopically overexpressed. Ectopic expres-
sion of miR-124-3p inhibitor (anti-miR-124-3p) effectively
unmasked the repressive effect of endogenous miR-124-3p
on GRIA4, NR3C1, and AKT1S1 mRNA levels (Figure 3a).
There was a negligible repressive effect (10%) of miR-124-3p
on GRIA3 expression, whereas a 25% expression upregula-
tion was noted with miR-124-3p antisense overexpression
(Supplementary Table S8A). GRIN2A transcript remained
unquantifiable in SH-SY5Y cell line (Supplementary Table
S7B), which is consistent with the Human Protein Atlas
Database (Uhlen et al, 2015).
To establish the direct effect of miR-124-3p on Gria4
expression, a luciferase reporter assay was performed using
HEK-293 cell line. The wild-type 3′ UTR of Gria4 mRNA
with a putative binding side for miR-124-3p was cloned
upstream to luciferase reporter gene in the pMIR reporter
vector backbone (Figure 3b). Simultaneous transfection of
the 3′ UTR reporter clone along with mimic miR-124-3p
oligo duplex resulted in significant downregulation of
reporter gene expression compared with nonspecific oligo
duplex
(scramble)-transfected control (Figure
3c). The
opposite effect on luciferase reporter expression was noted
as a function of miR-124-3p inhibitor overexpression where
luciferase activity was increased significantly as compared
with the nonspecific oligo-transfected control (Figure 3c).
RNP-IP to Identify Endogenous Binding of miR-124-3p
with Target Genes in CORT-Treated Rat PFC
The immunoprecipitated RISC was used to isolate RNA and
was subjected to qPCR amplification using a miR-124-3p
seed sequence and a set of 3′ UTR-specific primer pairs
recognizing two miR-124-3p-binding sites (7mer-A1 and
7mer-m8; proximal and distal from stop codons) for Nr3c1,
one for Gria4, and one for Akt1s1 transcript, one for Gria3
and one for Grin2a (Supplementary Table S3). To identify
that the miR-124-3p-Nr3c1 and miR-124-3p-Gria4 mRNA
complexes were indeed precipitated, a nonspecific primer
pair designed from coding region for the Gapdh gene was
used (Supplementary Table S8C). A threefold binding
enrichment for miR-124-3p on Gria4 3′ UTR was found in
the CORT-treated group (Figure 3d). The binding enrich-
ment for miR-124-3p on Nr3c1 transcript in the CORT-
treated group was ninefold, which was confined to the 7mer-
m8 site. No change was noted on the 7mer-A1 site
(Figure 3e). Likewise, no significant binding enrichment
was captured for the 3′ UTR of Akt1s1 transcript with
miR-124-3p (Figure 3f). The binding enrichments for
miR-124-3p and major depression
B Roy et al

Neuropsychopharmacology
 miR-124-3p on Gria3 and Grin2a transcripts were increased
in the CORT-treated group but they failed to reach statistical
significance (Figure 3g and h).
Locus-Specific Origin of Mature miR-124-3p
We mapped the candidate promoter element(s) responsible
for observed miR-124-3p transcriptional upregulation. For
this, we analyzed the relative expression of three miR-124
precursors originating from the following three different
chromosomal loci: pre-miR-124-1 (chromosome 15), pre-
miR-124-2 (chromosome 2), and pre-miR-124-3 (chromo-
some 3). As shown in Figure 4a, the relative transcript
abundance
of
precursor
miR-124-3
was
significantly
downregulated (~50%) in the CORT-treated group without
any change in pre-miR-124-1 and pre-miR-124-2.
MiR-124-3 Gene Promoter Analysis to Identify Putative
CpG Islands and their Possible Involvement in DNA
Methylation, Mediated by Dnmts in CORT-Treated Rat
PFC
Using ‘MethPrimer’ in silico CpG site prediction algorithm
(Li and Dahiya, 2002), we identified the presence of two CpG
islands in close vicinity on miR-124 gene promoter located
on chromosome 3 (Figure 4b). The first CpG island (Island1)
comprises 751 bases, whereas the second one (Island 2)
encompassed 108 bases. The overall GC contents for these
two islands were more than 50% (Figure 4b). The possible

and Akt1s1 p = 0.59; n = 6 in control and n = 5 in CORT group for Gria3 p = 0.02, Grin2a p = 0.03, Grin2b p = 0.52, and Nr3c2 p = 0.27). (c–f) Correlation
between miR-124-3p and Gria4, Gria3, Grin2a, and Nr3c1 genes in rat PFC were analyzed by Pearson product–moment analysis, which demonstrates a
negative trend under chronic CORT treatment determined by qPCR assay (data represented as Ct values corresponding to abundance of transcripts, Gria4,

difference between vehicle and CORT-treated groups.

Neuropsychopharmacology
 functional contribution of these two potential CpG islands
on miR-124-3 gene promoter was determined using MeDIP
assay. As shown in Figure 4c, the miR-124-3 promoter was
hypomethylated (~0.7-fold less enrichment) in the CORT-
treated group compared with the control group (Figure 4c).
To examine whether the observed promoter hypomethyla-
tion of miR-124-3p was associated with altered expression of
DNA
methylation
enzymes,
transcript
levels
of
DNA
methyltransferase (Dnmt) 1, Dnmt3a, and Dnmt3b were
determined. We found that expression of Dnmt3a was
significantly repressed in PFC of CORT-treated rats without
any change in Dnmt1 and Dnmt3b (Figure 4d).
miR-124-3p and Target Genes in PFC of MDD Subjects
The demographic characteristics of control (n = 15) and
MDD (n = 15) subjects are given in Supplementary Table S4.
In PFC of these subjects, expression of miR-124-3p and its
target genes were examined. As shown in Figure 5a, there
was a significant increase in the expression of miR-124-3p in
the MDD group. On the other hand, expressions of GRIA3,
GRIA4, and NR3C1 were significantly lower in the MDD
group, except that of GRIN2A variants (GRIN2A I and
GRIN2A II), which was lower but did not reached the
significance level (Figure 5b).
There was no significant effect of gender (Supplementary
Figure S1A), race (Supplementary Figure S1B), PMI and
brain pH (Supplementary Table S5) on expression of
miR-124-3p or target genes. On the other hand, age was
positively correlated with miR-124-3p expression, whereas it

miR-124-3p and major depression
B Roy et al
870
Neuropsychopharmacology
 examined one of the most significantly upregulated miRNAs
by CORT, i.e., miR-124-3p, which is not only developmen-
tally regulated but also has a significant role in maintaining
neuronal cell identity (Maiorano and Mallamaci, 2010) and
synaptic plasticity (Rajasethupathy et al, 2009).
We first determined the contributory pre-miRNAs, which
may be responsible for observed miR-124-3p transcriptional
upregulation under CORT treatment. Our qPCR analysis
showed significant involvement of pre-miR-124-3 located on
chromosome 3 compared with pre-miR-124-1 or pre-
miR-124-2 in forming the mature miR-124-3p in cytosol.
We next examined the factors responsible for increased
expression of miR-124-3p in CORT-treated rat PFC. In silico
characterization of miR-124-3 promoter on rat chromosome
3 mapped the presence of two potential CpG islands within
the proximal area (1 kb upstream) from transcription start
site. Using MeDIP analysis, we observed that two CpG
islands present in close vicinity of the miR-124-3 gene
transcriptional start site were hypomethylated in PFC of
CORT-treated
rats,
suggesting
epigenetic
regulation
of
miR-124-3p expression via altered promoter methylation.
Interestingly, we also found that expression of Dnmt3a was
significantly repressed without any change in Dnmt1 or 3b,
suggesting that maintenance but not de novo DNA methyla-
tion is compromised, which could partially be responsible for
promoter hypomethylation of miR-124-3 in PFC of CORT-
treated rats (Oka et al, 2006; LaPlant et al, 2010; Barbier et al,
2015). Moreover, we found that the promoter region of
miR-124-3p
contained
Nr3c1
(glucocorticoid
receptor)-
binding
sites
(Dwivedi
et
al,
2015),
which
regulate
miR-124-3 in a positive manner. However, our ChIP analysis
showed no significant differences in the interaction of
glucocorticoid receptor with the mapped Nr3c1-binding sites
between CORT-treated and control groups (Supplementary
Table S8D), suggesting the possibility that miR-124-3p may
not be directly regulated by Nr3c1 under chronic CORT
treatment.
Our initial screening of possible target genes based on high
prediction scores and presence of strong 7/8 mer sites at the
3′ UTR of the coded transcripts led us to choose eight genes
that are involved in various physiological functions in brain
including synaptic plasticity (Meador-Woodruff et al, 2001;
Sprengel, 2006; Sagata et al, 2010; Wei et al, 2012; Duric et al,
2013; Dwyer and Duman, 2013; Medina et al, 2013; Ota et al,
2014; Hall et al, 2015). These included Gria3 (glutamate
receptor, ionotropic, Ampa3), Gria4 (glutamate receptor,

to analyze the statistical significance. p-value for precursor-miR-124-3 was 0.007, whereas no significant differences were found for pre-miR-124-1 (p = 0.34)
and pre-miR-124-2 (p = 0.44). (b) Schematic diagram represents the in silico-analyzed data for miR-124 proximal promoter (1 kb upstream from transcription

and CORT-treated groups. Dnmt3a showed significant difference (p = 0.05), whereas no significant differences were found for Dnmt1 (p = 0.13) and Dnmt3b

 ionotropic, Ampa4), Grin2a (Glutamate Receptor, Ionotro-
pic, N-Methyl D-Aspartate 2A), Grin2b (Glutamate Recep-
tor, Ionotropic, N-Methyl D-Aspartate 2B), Nr3c1 (Nuclear
Receptor Subfamily 3, Group C, Member 1; Glucocorticoid
Receptor), Nr3c2 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 3, Group C,
Member 2; Mineralocorticoid Receptor), Hsp90ab1 (Heat
Shock Protein 90kDa Alpha (Cytosolic), Class B Member 1),
and Akt1s1 (Akt1 Substrate 1). Identification of Nr3c1 as a
direct target of miR-124-3p has been documented in
neuronal differentiation process (Vreugdenhil et al, 2009).
In the present study, in silico prediction analysis showed that
both Nr3c1 and Nr3c2 were targets of miR-124-3p with high
context scores. Our in vitro cellular model showed down-
regulation of the NR3C1 gene transcript in neuroblastoma
cell line (SH-SY5Y) as a function of ectopic overexpression
of
miR-124-3p
and
reversal
of
this
attenuation
with
concomitant knocking down of miR-124-3p. Interestingly,
the expression of only Nr3c1 but not Nr3c2 gene was
decreased
in
PFC
of
CORT-treated
rats,
which
was
reciprocally correlated with the expression of miR-124-3p
expression. This experiment suggests that Nr3c1 is a bona fide
target of miR-124-3p. Further analysis revealed two miR-124-
3p-binding sites in 3′ UTR of the Nr3c1 gene: 7mer-A1 and
7mer-m8. In vivo 3′ UTR enrichment analysis, which
identifies direct interaction of miRNAs with putative target
genes under physiological conditions, excluded the 7mer-A1-
binding site, which is proximal to the stop codon. On the
other hand, binding site with 7mer-m8 consensus in 3′ UTR
of Nr3c1, which is distal from stop codon, showed successful
binding with miR-124-3p seed sequence. These results suggest
that there is an enhanced interaction selectively of 7mer-m8
consensus site in 3′ UTR of Nr3c1 with miR-124-3p, which
could be responsible for the observed repression of the Nr3c1
gene in PFC of CORT-treated rats. The observed miR-124-3p-
mediated Nr3c1 repression via the 7mer-m8 consensus-
binding site may be central to behavioral maladaptation and
associated neuroendocrine responses to stress and induction
of depression phenotype.

miR-124-3p and major depression
B Roy et al
872
Neuropsychopharmacology
 In silico prediction analysis showed that a significant
number of AMPA/NMDA receptors are predicted targets of
miR-124-3p,
suggesting
a
possible
molecular
crosstalk
between miR-124-3p and these genes. Of these, NMDA
receptor subunits Grin2a and Grin2b and AMPA receptor
subunits Gria3 and Gria4 showed high predictability scores.
When examined, we found that expression of Grin2a, Gria3,
and Gria4 were significantly reduced in PFC of CORT-
treated rats, which established an inverse pattern with the
expression of miR-124-3p. On contrary to Grin2a and Gria3,
our in vivo RNP-IP immunoenrichment experiments with
Gria4 reflected post-transcriptional repression mediated by
miR-124-3p in PFC of CORT-treated rats.
Several studies point to a potential role of glutamatergic
system in depression. For example, altered GRIN2A tran-
script expression has been reported in dlPFC of MDD
subjects (Beneyto and Meador-Woodruff, 2008). GRIA3 is
well documented for its pre- and post-synaptic localization
in the pyramidal neurons of PFC and potential contribution
toward synaptic plasticity (Sprengel, 2006). Reports of altered
GRIA3 expression in dentate gyrus and CA1 (Duric et al,
2013) as well as in PFC of MDD individuals (Meador-
Woodruff et al, 2001; Beneyto and Meador-Woodruff, 2006)
raise the possibility of potential contribution of this AMPA
receptor in compromised synaptic plasticity in depression.
GRIA4, which is presumably involved in synaptic plasticity
and the development of functional neural circuitry through
the recruitment of other AMPA receptor subunits, has not
been well studied in relation to stress or depression, although
some studies point to a decreased expression of this receptor
in PFC of MDD subjects (Meador-Woodruff et al, 2001;
Beneyto and Meador-Woodruff, 2006). More recently, it has
been shown that miR-124 and GRIA4 may contribute to
social
behavioral
deficits
in
frontotemporal
dementia
(Gascon et al, 2014) and reduced expression of AMPA
receptors and gradual loss of post-synaptic membranes of
PFC neurons may be critical under chronic stress (Yuen et al,
2012). Although membrane trafficking and ubiquitination-
induced receptor degradation have been shown to be
responsible
for
impaired
receptor
functionality
under
chronic stress (Yuen et al, 2012), the precise molecular
mechanism
is
unknown.
Our
current
observations
of
miR-124-3p-mediated
repression
of
glutamate
receptor
transcripts open up a new layer of complex regulation of
glutamatergic system, which could eventually shed light on
underlying epigenetic regulation of glutamatergic neuro-
transmission as a consequence of hyperactive HPA axis and
consequent depression.
Despite strong prediction scores in the 3′ UTR of
miR-124-3p, perfect 8mer seed sequence matches, and
in vitro expression modulation with miR-124-3p mimic
and antisense overexpression, we did not find any significant
change in the expression of Hsp90ab1 or Akt1s1 in PFC of
CORT-treated rats. Hsp90ab1 is a member of heat shock
protein family 90 and has been shown to be activated as a
function of glucocorticoid receptor overexpression in mouse
hippocampal dentate gyrus (Wei et al, 2012). On the other
hand, Akt1s1 is a substrate of Akt1 and is a critical
component of mTORC1 signaling (Sancak et al, 2007),
whose role in synaptogenesis is well demonstrated (Dwyer
and Duman, 2013; Ota et al, 2014). Our findings rule out
in vivo interaction of at least the Akt1s1 gene with miR-124
under CORT chronic treatment, suggesting that these
genes,
although
may
be
important
in
the
stress
pathway, their regulation may not be associated directly
with miR-124-3p.
To test whether the observed changes in miR-124-3p and
target genes can be replicated in MDD patients, we examined
their expression levels in PFC obtained from subjects
diagnosed
with
MDD
and
healthy
controls.
As
with
CORT-treated rats, we found that not only the expression
of miR-124-3p was upregulated but there was a reciprocal
downregulation of target genes GRIA3, GRIA4, and NR3C1
in PFC of MDD subjects. Several reports suggest that under
certain pathophysiological conditions, miRNAs are released
into extracellular space and appear in the body fluids, which
could be due to blebbing of apoptotic bodies, budding, and
shedding of microvesicles or due to active secretion in the
form of exosomes as complexes with proteins such as AGO2,
NPM1, and so on. Because of these reasons, several recent
studies
show
that
circulating
miRNAs
may
serve
as
biomarker for disease pathophysiology (Foss et al, 2011;
Zhang et al, 2011; Jin et al, 2013; Sheinerman and Umansky,
2013; Maffioletti et al, 2014; Tsujiura et al, 2015). When
investigated, we found that the expression of miR-124-3p
was significantly upregulated in the serum of MDD patients
compared with healthy control subjects, which was similar to
CORT-treated rats and human postmortem studies.
CONCLUSION
Altogether, this is the first comprehensive and mechanistic
study at in vitro and in vivo levels, which demonstrates that
not only are there consistent depression-associated changes
in the expression of miR-124-3p across different species but
also the genes that are targets of this miRNA are highly
dysregulated, showing altered response at the functional
level. We also identified a specific precursor miRNA
(miR-124-3) located on rat chromosome 3, which appears
to be responsible for the higher expression of miR-124-3p.
Interestingly, miR-124-3p is epigenetically regulated, which
for the first time suggests the role played by gene–
environment interaction in miRNA-mediated regulation of
gene
expression.
Our
study
also
has
implications
in
identifying a putative biomarker for MDD pathogenesis as
similar changes were noted in the expression of this miRNA
in postmortem brain and serum of MDD subjects. This
appears to be highly reliable as miR-124-3p can cross the
blood–brain barrier and be released into blood (Sheinerman
and Umansky, 2013; Devaux et al, 2015). Therapeutically,
miR-124-3p can be a potential target for novel drug
development, which is supported by a recent observation
that downregulating miR-124-3p can lead to resistance in
depression-like behavior in rodents (Bahi et al, 2014).
