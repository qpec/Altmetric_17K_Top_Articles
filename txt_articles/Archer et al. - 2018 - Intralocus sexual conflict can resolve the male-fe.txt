Intralocus sexual conflict can resolve the
male-female health-survival paradox

At any given age, men are more likely to die than women, but women have poorer health at
older ages. This is referred to as the “male-female, health-survival paradox”, which is not fully
understood. Here, we provide a general solution to the paradox that relies on intralocus
sexual conflict, where alleles segregating in the population have late-acting positive effects on
male fitness, but negative effects on female health. Using an evolutionary modelling frame-
work, we show that male-benefit, female-detriment alleles can spread if they are expressed
after female reproduction stops. We provide support for our conflict based solution using
experimental Drosophila data. Our results show that selecting for increased late-life male
reproductive effort can increase male fitness but have a detrimental effect on female fitness.
Furthermore, we show that late-life male fertility is negatively genetically correlated with
female health. Our study suggests that intralocus sexual conflict could resolve the health-
survival paradox.

hile we broadly understand why mortality risk rises as
fertility and general performance decline with age1, it
is less clear why the tempo and severity of these
changes often differ between the sexes. In humans, survival, fer-
tility, and performance show sex-specific patterns of decline with
age. Strikingly, women stop reproducing decades before dying,
while men can reproduce throughout their adult lives. Addi-
tionally, men are more likely to die than women in most age-
classes, but are healthier than women late-in-life2,3. To be clear,
this is not just due to the selective loss of low quality males, as
female mortality rates are lower than male rates at nearly all ages2
despite poorer female health. This sex difference has been termed
the “male–female, health-survival paradox”, and while its causes
are not well understood, some resolution of it is needed if we are
to ensure healthy aging as human lifespan increases4.
The sex-specific mortality element of the health-survival
paradox is widespread as women outlive men in most countries
studied5. There is also abundant evidence that older men are
healthier than older women in many countries, as although
women live longer than men, they experience a smaller propor-
tion of their lives in good health6. Men may even experience more
time in good health than women, despite dying earlier7. It is
important to note however that the magnitude, and even direc-
tion, of sex differences in physical performance relies on how
performance is measured5. That is, women may have a lower
chance of developing some diseases (e.g. heart disease) but are
more likely to suffer from chronic, non-life-threatening condi-
tions8. Social and behavioural differences might contribute to
these sex differences in survival and health. For example, men are
often more likely to engage in risky behaviours (e.g. smoking)
than women, but sex differences in mortality are present even in
communities where both sexes avoid risky behaviours9. Similarly,
men and women with similar medical conditions are equally
likely to report health problems10. While sex differences in
behaviour may contribute towards the male–female, health-
survival paradox, the consistent observation of lower female
mortality but poorer female health at older ages in human
populations across the world suggests that this paradox has, at
least in part, a genetic basis2. To date, most biological mechan-
isms implicated in the paradox focus on understanding why men
die earlier than women (reviewed in refs. 2,11) rather than on why
late-life health differs between the sexes. Here we focus on the
health aspect of the paradox and suggest that intralocus sexual
conflict might explain why women are less healthy than men late-
in-life.
Intralocus sexual conflict occurs when the sexes have different
optimal values for a shared trait with a common genetic basis. For
example, male broad-horned flour beetles develop enlarged
mandibles and males with larger mandibles have higher fitness.
However, daughters of males with large mandibles have lower
fitness because of the masculinisation of the body that occurs with
these genotypes12. This means that alleles associated with
mandibles are subjected to an intersexual tug-of-war over optimal
values, with high fitness male genotypes making low fitness
females. This type of conflict means that the alleles encoding a
high-quality male often produce low quality females and vice
versa12. A role for sexual conflict in aging, lifespan and sex dif-
ferences in health has been recognised for years13,14. However, to
the best of our knowledge, sexual conflict has not been considered
as a driver of the male–female, health-survival paradox. Given the
existence of the menopause, which enables selection to bias allelic
values towards male-benefit late-in-life, there is enormous
potential for sexual conflict to be at the heart of this paradox and
by recognising its role, we may better understand what (if any-
thing) we can do about it. The aim of this paper is simply to
highlight that as well as explaining sex differences in health and
aging in general, intralocus sexual conflict could be central to a
long-standing puzzle in medical sciences: why do men die, while
women suffer?
Intralocus sexual conflict could cause sex differences in health
if there are sexually antagonistic alleles segregating in a popula-
tion that increase male fitness but reduce female health. Fitness
and health are different concepts. Fitness can be thought of as the
number of offspring an individual contributes to the next gen-
eration15, and is often measured as lifetime reproductive success,
while health reflects how well individuals maintain homoeostasis.
Typically, healthier individuals are fitter. For example, more
attractive people are likely to have high fitness (because they can
attract more mates) and are also less likely to report ill health16.
However, health and fitness are at least partially decoupled in
humans because after the menopause female fitness plummets
while health does not to anywhere near the same degree (after
menopause direct fitness contributions fall to zero, but health
declines are not as severe; not all females experience a complete
loss of homoeostasis). Furthermore, sexually antagonistic alleles
exist in human populations. For example, men that look parti-
cularly masculine tend to have more short-term partners, which
is likely to increase their fitness17, and are more resistant to
respiratory conditions18. On the other hand, a masculine
appearance in women is associated with a greater risk of devel-
oping these conditions18. Clearly, females that express alleles that
are positively associated with male fitness can experience reduced
health.
For intralocus sexual conflict to explain the health-survival
paradox, male-benefit sexually antagonistic alleles with late-acting
effects must accumulate. This is entirely feasible because women
experience the menopause. This means that selection against any
alleles with costly effects when expressed in females will weaken
dramatically once women undergo the menopause and stop
reproducing, because these alleles can only have indirect effects
on female fitness. However, in men there will be selection for
male-benefit alleles over the entire lifespan because men can keep
reproducing until advanced ages19. This would allow late-acting,
male-benefit sexually antagonistic alleles to spread and accumu-
late in the human genome and reduce female health late-in-life, as
females carrying late-acting male-benefit alleles express trait
values closer to male than female optima.
To formally test this hypothesis, we assessed whether a male-
benefit, sexually antagonistic allele could spread through a diploid
population using an evolutionary modelling framework. We show
theoretically that under biologically realistic assumptions of costs
and benefits, such antagonistic alleles can accumulate. Using
Drosophila model systems, we then assessed whether sexual
conflict solutions are feasible by testing whether populations
evolving with selection for late-life male reproduction, but with
no direct selection on females (as is the case for post-menopausal
women), developed late-life costs to females. Finally, we tested
whether late-life male fertility and female performance are
negatively associated across a range of standardised genotypes
(iso-female lines). Our data broadly support the predictions and
suggest that intralocus sexual conflict could help explain the
male–female, health-survival paradox.
Results
The model. We devised a population genetic model to track the
evolutionary dynamics of a sexually antagonistic allele through a
diploid population (Methods). Simulating this model under a
wide range of assumptions regarding male-fitness benefits and
female fitness costs (Fig. 1), we found that if a sexually antag-
onistic allele improves male fitness and reduces female health
without affecting female fitness, then there is no selection against

 it and it will spread throughout the population. However, a male-
benefit allele could affect female fitness by reducing female health,
even if it acted after the menopause. This is because older women
can care for grandchildren and gain indirect fitness by improving
their grandchildren’s survival20. If a male-benefit allele reduces
female health so severely that it impairs care, it may reduce
female fitness. In this case, the spread of a male-benefit allele
depends on how much that allele improves male fitness, relative
to how much it reduces female fitness. This is clearly shown in
Fig. 1a when the fitness costs of females expressing the allele are
low, then the allele is likely to spread even if males only receive a
modest fitness benefit. As the costs to females rise and the male
benefits fall, then the allele will become less prevalent in the
population and it will eventually be lost. The balance of costs and
benefits that favour the spread of a sexually antagonistic allele
depend on the nature of that allele, i.e. whether it is dominant
(Fig. 1a) or recessive (Fig. 1d) in both sexes, or has sex-specific
patterns of expression (Fig. 1b, c). However, the most important
thing to note is that alleles reducing post-menopausal female
health exist over a broad range of parameter space regardless of
the genetic detail, and under some conditions non-antagonistic
alleles are likely to be rare. This strongly suggests that late-acting
male-benefit, female-cost alleles are likely to be common and
could therefore be responsible for the relatively unhealthy aging
of females.
Selecting on late-life male fertility affects female lifespan. Using
an insect model (Drosophila simulans), we then tested whether
selecting for increased late-life male reproductive success had a
negative impact on females. After 12 generations of selection, we
found there was a negative relationship between the fitness ranks
of the sexes, such that that in populations where there was the
greatest increase in late-life male fertility, there was the greatest
reduction in female longevity (correlation coefficient = −0.929;
t = −4.38, df = 3, P = 0.022) (Fig. 2).
Association between late-life male fitness and female health.
We then used another insect model (D. melanogaster) to directly
assess female health associations with late-life male fitness. Across
isolines (standardised genotypes), there was a negative correlation
between male fertility late-in-life and a measure of physiological

Fig. 1 Population-level allele frequencies are determined by sex-specific fitness costs and benefits. The graphs show equilibrium allele frequency from
simulating our two-sex models over a wide range of male-fitness benefits (relative reproductive success of males with the allele compared to males lacking
the allele) and female-fitness costs (relative reproductive success in females with the allele compared to females lacking the allele). The red regions show
the conditions where the sexually antagonistic allele goes to fixation, the blue regions indicate where the allele will be lost and the white/colour mixed
regions show where both allelic variants coexist. Each panel assumes a different mode of inheritance: the allele is dominant in both sexes (a), dominant in
males but recessive in females (b), recessive in males but dominant in females (c) or recessive in both sexes (d)

(correlation coefficient = −0.715; t = −2.51, df = 6, P = 0.046).
That is, for genotypes where males had large numbers of offspring
late-in-life, females performed particularly badly in negative
geotaxis assays (one measure of physiological health) (Fig. 3a).
However, there was no relationship between male fertility late-in-
life and a second measure of female health, recovery time from
anaesthesia (correlation coefficient = 0.257; t = 0.596, df = 5, P =
0.577) (Fig. 3b).
Discussion
Human females tend to live longer but are in poorer health than
males late-in-life. This is the health-survival paradox, and given
that females have higher survival at any given age despite being in
poorer health, this cannot be solely due to selective disappearance
of low quality males. We propose a very general resolution to this
paradox—intralocus sexual conflict—and both theoretical and
empirical data support this solution.
The central premise of our proposed solution, that alleles with
fitness benefits to one sex can spread in a population despite costs
to the other sex, is supported theoretically here and by earlier
models21. Our model assumes females are the longer-lived sex.
This is true for humans and many primates for which we have
high-quality demographic data22. We also assume there are alleles
that improve male fitness but reduce female health. This
assumption is supported by the observation that masculine
looking men are both likely to have higher reproductive success
and suffer less from some health problems, but masculine looking
women have a higher risk of these conditions18 and by the wealth
of direct evidence showing that negative intersexual fitness cor-
relations are widespread across the animal kingdom12,23. While
alleles with sexually antagonistic effects are common, their effects
could be modified by alleles that alter hormone levels. So for
example, sex hormones could affect the expression of shared traits
in sex-specific ways, relaxing sexual conflict24. However, while sex
hormones can relieve sexual conflict, in bank voles there can also
be pronounced sexual conflict over optimal levels of circulating
sex hormones, and these can lead to negative correlations for
fitness across the sexes25. Thus, there is the potential for sexual
conflict in humans despite a role for sex hormones in generating
sexual dimorphism. We also rely on the reductions in health not
being so severe that they reduce female lifespan. In other words,
we assume that lifespan and health can evolve somewhat

 independently in humans. This assumption is supported by the
existence of the health-survival paradox. Our idea also relies on
there being male-benefit alleles that act after the age of meno-
pause and this relies on men expressing these alleles having
reproductive success late-in-life. Although men with higher
reproductive success tend to live shorter lives26, in many societies
men can reproduce long after women experience the meno-
pause19 (even though most male reproduction occurs at ages
when women are still reproductively active). In any case, our
model shows that as long as males achieve some fitness late-in-life
and as long as this does not trade-off with early-life fitness, these
alleles will spread through the population.
Additionally, for the conflict hypothesis to be a feasible solu-
tion to the health-survival paradox, the male benefits and female
fitness costs that promote the spread of sexually antagonistic
alleles must be realistic. We assume that the benefits of expressing
these alleles range between 1 (i.e. males with and without this
allele produce the same numbers of offspring) and 2 (i.e. males
with this allele produce twice as many progeny as those without
it). In traditional societies, average male reproductive success is
around six offspring but in some societies can vary between 0 and
80 children27. Therefore, the advantages of expressing male-
benefit alleles could be even higher than those we modelled. In
females, the costs of expressing late-acting, male-benefit sexually
antagonistic alleles are likely to be low. Although impaired health
late-in-life could limit how well women provision their grand-
children, and so reduce indirect female fitness28, these effects will
be modest because grandchildren only share around a quarter of
their grandmother’s genome. Stated another way, direct effects
tend be more selectively important than indirect effects. On
balance therefore, it seems feasible that late-acting, male-benefit
alleles will have greater positive effects on male fitness than costs
to females, and so they are likely to spread. However, the female
fitness costs of expressing male-benefit, female-detriment alleles
have never been fully quantified in humans.
Having shown theoretically that the alleles we envisage could
underpin the health-survival paradox, we empirically tested these
predictions in a general way using Drosophila models. We
selected on male fertility late-in-life, and as a correlated response
females suffered a reduction in lifespan. This is clearly not a
perfect test of the model, if only because our model predicts
reduced female health and not survival. Additionally, our control
is the founder population from which experimental flies were
derived, an approach akin to translocation experiments in ecology
and not a “classical” control. Finally, we are testing a model about
human health in flies—the nature of the fitness costs of expres-
sing male-benefit alleles will inevitably differ between flies and
humans for many reasons, not least because flies do not experi-
ence the menopause or receive any indirect benefits from pro-
viding parental care. However, it is important to note that the aim
of this experiment was simply to see if biasing selection late-in-
life towards one sex, can have costly effects on the other. Our data
suggest that it can and indeed, this is precisely what an enormous
body of evolutionary theory predicts.
We then showed that genotypes with high late-life male fertility
produce females that perform less well in negative geotaxis assays,
which is a general measure of fly health. Although geotaxis assays
are not a perfect health assay, they do suggest that poorly per-
forming females have reduced motor function. This has clear
parallels to human data, where elderly women consistently
experience greater physical restrictions in their daily lives than
men. We did not detect a relationship between male fertility and
recovery time from anaesthesia. However, given that human
women do not perform worse than men in all individual mea-
sures of performance, despite consistently experiencing poorer
overall health29, it is not surprising that we found differences
across our measures of health. A more robust test of our
hypothesis would require adopting a similar approach in humans
and testing whether men with greater fertility late-in-life have
sisters with poor late-life health. If so, this would indicate that
females carrying alleles that build a high-quality male suffer more
late-in-life. To our knowledge, these data are not available.
In summary, our results indicate that intralocus sexual conflict
could have a pivotal role in reducing female health late-in-life and
thus provide a general solution to the human male–female,
health-survival paradox. To the best of our knowledge, the
male–female, health-survival paradox has never been addressed
through a conflict lens. However, there are caveats to our
experimental evolution data and historical human pedigree data
would enable the conflict explanation to be tested more directly.
Robust testing of this idea is important, particularly as the age of
reproduction in many societies is being pushed later in life. This
could have impacts on sex differences in healthy aging if our
hypothesis is correct, although the nature of these impacts would
depend on whether sex differences in reproductive success late-
in-life become relaxed or exaggerated as a consequence of age-
related reproductive shifts.
Methods
The model. We used a simple population genetic model to simulate and track the
prevalence of a sexually antagonistic allele, x, through a diploid population over
time. To allow for the allele to have a sex-specific effect and to be either recessive or
dominant, we split the populations into males (m) and females (f) that are further
divided according to the allelic composition of the genetic locus in question. That
is, we account for individuals that are homozygous wrt x (mxx and fxx), homo-
zygous wrt y (myy and fyy) or heterozygous (mxy and fxy). We assumed mating to be
frequency-dependent and for simplicity assumed the population size remains
constant over time. The population dynamics can then be described by the fol-
lowing set of differential equations:

is the proportion of males or females with locus (ij). ρ denotes the female sex bias
(if considered). We further assumed that the cost or benefit associated with car-
rying allele x is solely manifested through a decrease or increase in lifetime
reproductive success. We cannot model costs to females as reduced health per se; if
reductions in health do not reduce female fitness then trivially, any male-benefit
alleles will spread. We therefore assume that alleles that severely reduce female
health, reduce female fitness by reducing how well women care for their offspring
and grand-offspring. Under this assumption, a shortening or lengthening of an
individual’s reproductive period is equivalent to a reduction or increase in repro-
ductive fitness. In the model this can be incorporated by changing πs

This formulation also allows us to consider dominant and recessive effects in
females and males differentially. To obtain equilibrium population frequencies, we
solved Eqs. (1) and (2) numerically using the odeint solver from the NumPy
Python package. For each combination of male-fitness benefits (bij) and female
fitness costs (cij), we simulated the model forward in time until an equilibrium
point was reached, using the following initial conditions: mxx(0) = 0.05, mxy(0) =
0.3, myy(0) = 0.1, fxx(0) = 0.1, fxy(0) = 0.35, fyy(0) = 0.1.
Selecting on late-life male fertility affects female lifespan. If intralocus sexual
conflict is responsible for the health-survival paradox, then selecting for late-life
male reproduction should result in the accumulation of late-acting male-benefit
alleles that reduce female fitness. To broadly test this idea, we selected for late-life
male fertility in replicate populations of Drosophila simulans but relaxed selection
on females. If sexual conflict is responsible for the health-survival paradox, then in
populations where males experienced the greatest increase in fertility late-in-life,
females should experience the greatest reduction in lifespan (relative to controls).
Selecting on male fertility involved establishing five experimental populations
and five female-supply populations (see below) using flies collected from our large
outbreeding, free-mating lab-stock population (100 males and 100 females (all
virgins) per experimental and female-supply population). For 28 days, fly food in
the experimental populations was changed every five days to ensure that no eggs
laid emerged as adults. On day 28, flies were anaesthetised with CO2, and removed
from the cage. One hundred virgin 3- to 5-day-old females were taken from their
paired-female-supply populations (to ensure experimental populations were
independently evolving), and added to the appropriate experimental population.
This should reduce selection for old age reproduction in females. Old (28 days)
males from each experimental population and young females from paired-female
supply were then left for three days to lay eggs. From these, 100 male and 100
female offspring were collected on emergence and these seeded the next generation
in each experimental population. This procedure was repeated for 12 generations.
Female-supply populations were also fed every five days, but here new food was
added on day 15, removed on day 18 and offspring collected from eggs laid
between days 15 and 18. This regime is shown in Supplementary Figure 1.
To test for male responses to our artificial selection, we collected 30 virgin males
from each experimental population and from the lab-stock population. Each male
was housed in a 40 mL vial, with 8 mL of medium for two days to mature. Then
two virgin lab-stock females were added and these were replaced with young virgin
females every week to ensure males had continuous access to young virgins (as is
the case in selection cages). Any female that died was replaced with a like-age
virgin. On day 28, male fertility was assayed. Each focal male was paired with a
virgin stock female. Males were removed eight hours later. Females were allowed to
lay eggs in three vials over seven days and all offspring that emerged from these
vials were counted as our measure of male fertility (full details in Supplementary
Figure 2). Males that did not appear to mate (i.e. counts of offspring = zero), were
excluded from analyses.
To test for female impacts resulting from selecting on male fertility, 40 females
from each experimental population and the lab-stock population were collected as
virgins and housed individually in 40 mL vials contain 8 mL of Jazz mix medium.
After four days, flies were moved into a new vial. The following morning two stock
virgin males (three to five days old) were added and kept with the females for three
hours before being removed. This regime was repeated across the entire lifespan of
each female fly (full details in Supplementary Figure 3). Pairing females with two
males for three hours every five days ensures that females reproduce as normal but
lifespan is not reduced due to the direct costs of mating or harassment30. Females
were checked daily for survival and adult lifespan was calculated.
To assess how late-life male fertility evolved in the experimental populations,
mean male fertility in the stock population was subtracted from the mean value for
each experimental population. High positive values meant that males from the
experimental population performed much better than non-selected males, and a
negative value meant that experimental males had worse late-life fertility. Female
lifespan was treated in the same way (i.e. average population value—average stock-
population value) and a Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated in R
version 3.4.1.31 to analyse the correlation between male late-life fertility and female
lifespan.
Association between late-life male fitness and female health. The above
“selection then assay protocol” tests the general principle of the health-survival
paradox, but does not directly test for female health declines as late-life male fitness
increases. If intralocus sexual conflict is responsible for the health-survival paradox,
then genotypes that produce high fitness males should produce females with poor
health and vice versa. This was tested using Drosophila melanogaster Genetic
Reference Panel (DGRP) lines and two biomarkers of female physical function to
reveal underlying health.
Ten DGRP lines were used (ID = 28, 101, 136, 360, 382, 443, 595, 737, 783,
796). Flies were maintained under a 12:12 L:D cycle at 25 °C. Lines were excluded
from analyses, if fewer than two animals survived to assay. The final sample sizes
for each line and trait are given in Supplementary Table 1. Experimental flies were
collected as virgins and aspirated into individual 100 mL vials on their day of
hatching with 8 mL of medium. Dahomey tester flies were used as mating partners
to assess reproductive performance. Ivanov et al.32 recorded lifespan in DGRP lines
and median lifespan ranged between 21 and 79 days. We therefore conducted tests
when adults were 35 days old, approximately the median lifespan for some of the
shorter lived genotypes.
Negative geotaxis (vertical climbing in response to shock) was one measure of
fly health. It is a measure of motor ability that shows an age-dependent decline in
Drosophila33. To assay negative geotaxis, flies were aspirated into 15 mL vials
attached to a drop mechanism, which was raised 10 cm and dropped. A camera
recorded every trial, to record the distance that flies climbed in the two minutes
after dropping. Flies were then given two minutes to recover before the process was
repeated. All observations were made blind—flies were labelled with a random
number and videos were analysed independently by two different observers, and
any values that differed by >3 mm were observed by a third experimenter to reach
consensus. Recovery time from anaesthesia was also used as a measure of female
health, as this can indicate metabolic performance. Assay flies were transferred into
a 15 mL vials where they were exposed to CO2 (1 L/min) for thirty seconds. Flies
were then put onto a piece of white paper and the time until flies stood upright was
recorded and used as our measure of performance. All assays were recorded within
two hours of lights going (i.e. 9–11 am) and flies assayed in a random order.
Measures were made blind; flies were labelled with a random number by one lab
member, before vials were passed to the observer.
Reproductive performance of the DGRP males was assessed after matings with
virgin females from our wildtype stock animals. Each experimental male was
housed with two virgin tester females, aged between 3 and 6 days old, that had been
left overnight in 40 mL mating vials containing surplus food. Flies were then left for
48 h, after which, females were transferred to a vial for oviposition for a further
48 h, while males were removed and frozen. Females were then moved to one more
vial for a further 48 h, such that their egg laying over 6 days was recorded.
Oviposition vials were then incubated at the temperature from which their sire
originated and offspring were counted 8 days after the first day of offspring
eclosion.
Please note, differences in timings between the two male fertility assays
represent species-specific lab protocols. Additionally, males were kept as virgins
prior to being assayed in this experiment to allow comparison with females who
were also maintained as virgins to ensure that direct physiological damage caused
by male harassment did not reduce their physical performance.
To test for effects, we created a single average value, for each line and each trait
for analyses (i.e. we conducted derived variable analyses). For male fertility, zero
counts were once more excluded as we could not be sure that males had mated
if no offspring were produced, but note this is conservative for our hypothesis.
For female geotaxis distance, we included zero values but note that the results
of analyses are the same irrespective of whether we include all data for both
traits or exclude zeros. We then used a Pearson’s correlations, calculated in
R, to analyse the associations between male late-life fertility, and female health
measures.
