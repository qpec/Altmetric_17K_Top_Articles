discrimination of social stimuli

Oxytocin receptor (Oxtr) signaling in neural circuits mediating discrimination of social stimuli
and affiliation or avoidance behavior is thought to guide social recognition. Remarkably, the
physiological functions of Oxtrs in the hippocampus are not known. Here we demonstrate
using genetic and pharmacological approaches that Oxtrs in the anterior dentate gyrus (aDG)
and anterior CA2/CA3 (aCA2/CA3) of mice are necessary for discrimination of social, but
not non-social, stimuli. Further, Oxtrs in aCA2/CA3 neurons recruit a population-based
coding mechanism to mediate social stimuli discrimination. Optogenetic terminal-specific
attenuation revealed a critical role for aCA2/CA3 outputs to posterior CA1 for discrimination
of social stimuli. In contrast, aCA2/CA3 projections to aCA1 mediate discrimination of
non-social stimuli. These studies identify a role for an aDG-CA2/CA3 axis of Oxtr expressing
cells in discrimination of social stimuli and delineate a pathway relaying social memory
computations in the anterior hippocampus to the posterior hippocampus to guide social
recognition.

 S
ocial recognition in mammals is a complex biological
process that necessitates, in part, communication between
neural circuits subserving discrimination of socially relevant
stimuli and those mediating expression of affiliation or avoidance.
Alterations in circuits underlying social discrimination or social
interaction or the pathways that link these circuits may underlie
social recognition deficits seen in autism spectrum disorders and
other psychiatric disorders1–3. One general mechanism by which
distinct behaviors such as reward seeking, social exploration, and
discrimination of social stimuli are orchestrated is through the
actions of neuromodulators such as oxytocin (OT)4–7. Although
a growing number of studies have begun to shed light on OT
receptor (Oxtr) signaling in the nucleus accumbens, piriform
cortex, lateral septum (LS), prefrontal cortex, and ventral
tegmental area in social interaction8–17, the role of hippocampal
Oxtrs in social memory processing is not known.
Evidence from classical lesion studies and more recently, from
optogenetic and genetic manipulations implicates the anterior
and posterior hippocampus in social memory processing18–24.

Basolateral amygdala inputs to the posterior hippocampus
modulate social interaction20 and posterior CA1 (pCA1) via its
projections to the nucleus accumbens is both necessary and
sufficient to mediate discrimination of social, but not non-social,
stimuli25. As aCA2/CA3 projects to aCA1, dorsolateral septum
(DLS) and pCA1, it is not clear which of these projections relay
social memory computations from aCA2/CA3 to brain regions
such as the NAcc and prefrontal cortex that subserve social
behavior9–16,26. Furthermore, because aCA1 is also important for
novel object recognition27,28, it is unclear whether aCA2/CA3
projections to aCA1 mediate discrimination of both social and
non-social stimuli.
Radioligand binding studies, knock-in reporter mice and
immunohistochemistry studies have begun to illuminate the
distribution of Oxtrs in the hippocampus with varying degrees of
resolution24,29–32. In mice, Oxtr expression has been reported in
polymorphic layer of dentate gyrus (DG), and CA2 and CA3,
although the precise identity of Oxtr-expressing cell types is
poorly characterized. Pioneering studies relying on injection of
anti-OT (OT) sera into the posterior hippocampus suggested a
role for OT in social exploration33. Partial genetic deletion of
Oxtr in the forebrain during the postnatal period impaired
discrimination
of
intrastrain,
but
not
inter-strain,
social
recognition suggesting a role for forebrain Oxtrs in fine
discrimination
of
social
stimuli34.
However,
whether
this
phenotype is due to loss of Oxtr signaling in the hippocampus,
LS, ventral pallidum, or other brain regions is not known34,35.
Studies of contextual discrimination have demonstrated that
the aDG-CA3 circuit is critical for resolving interference between
similar memories36,37. One circuit mechanism utilized to mini-
mize interference between similar memories is population-based
encoding of similar inputs in non-overlapping ensembles of
neurons. Such a mechanism is thought to support pattern
separation, as it facilitates transformation of similar inputs into
divergent outputs38–46. Although population-based coding in
aDG-CA3 has been demonstrated to underlie discrimination of
similar contexts or navigation of similar environments43,44,47–51,
it remains unclear whether this mechanism is also used for
discrimination of social stimuli. Consistent with this notion,
in vivo recordings in CA2 in rats reveal global remapping of place
fields in response to presentation of a familiar or novel social
stimulus in a context21. As Oxtr signaling enhances signal-to-
noise processing in both mice and rats15,52,53, Oxtrs are well
positioned to modulate DG-CA3 encoding functions under
conditions in which OT is released (e.g., when processing social
information). Based on these observations, we hypothesized that
Oxtrs in aDG-CA2/CA3 contribute to discrimination of social
stimuli.
Here we demonstrate using genetic and pharmacological
approaches
that
Oxtrs
in
the
aDG-CA2/CA3
circuit
are
necessary for discrimination of social, but not non-social (object),
stimuli. We show using cellular compartment analysis of
temporal
activity
by
fluorescence
in
situ
hybridization
(catFISH)54,55 that Oxtrs in aCA2/CA3 neurons recruit a
population-based coding mechanism to mediate discrimination
of
social
stimuli.

studies revealed a critical role for aCA2/CA3 outputs to pCA1,
but not aCA1, for discrimination of social stimuli. In contrast,
aCA2/CA3 projections to aCA1 mediate discrimination of
non-social stimuli. Together these studies identify a role for a
aDG-CA2/CA3 axis of Oxtr-expressing cells in discrimination of
social stimuli and delineate a pathway by which computations
underlying social information processing are relayed from
anterior hippocampus to the posterior hippocampus, to guide
social recognition.
Results
Characterization of Oxtr expression in the hippocampus. To
comprehensively map the expression of Oxtr in the hippocampus,
we performed multiplex FISH using riboprobes directed against
Oxtr, glutamate decarboxylase 1 (Gad1), a marker for GABAergic
inhibitory neurons, and markers of interneuron subpopulations,
Parvalbumin (PV), and Somatostatin (SST) in age-matched male
and female mice. Within anterior DG (aDG), Oxtr expression
colocalized primarily with Gad1 (84.3% in females and 87.4% in
males), indicating the identity of these neurons primarily as
inhibitory interneurons (Fig. 1a, b). A small population of Oxtr+
cells in the hilus did not colocalize with Gad1 (Fig. 1a), suggesting
that these cells are most likely excitatory mossy cells. Oxtr
expression was absent from Gad1− cells in the granule cell layer of
the DG, indicating that Oxtr is not expressed in dentate granule
neurons. Analysis of Oxtr, PV, and SST expression in aDG
showed greater colocalization of Oxtr with SST than with PV
(Fig. 1c, d). Further, a large percentage of Oxtr cells in aDG
were negative for both PV and SST, indicating the presence of
additional subclasses of Oxtr+ interneurons that are not captured
in PV- and SST-only expressing populations.
Next we analyzed Oxtr expression within anterior CA subfields
as follows: aCA3proximal, aCA2/CA3distal, and aCA1 (schematic
shown in Fig. 1l). Quantification of Oxtr intensity revealed
enrichment of Oxtr expression in the aCA2/CA3distal region while
Oxtr levels in aCA3proximal and aCA1 were comparable to that of
background (Fig. 1e, f, g, k). Colocalization analysis of Oxtr and
Gad1 in aCA2/CA3distal subregion revealed low overlap (10.1% in
females and 8.9% in males, Fig. 1g, h), suggesting that the vast
majority of Oxtr-expressing cells in aCA2/CA3distal are excitatory.
Assessment of overlap between Oxtr, PV, and SST in aCA2/
CA3distal revealed a larger fraction of PV+Oxtr+ cells than
SST+Oxtr+ cells (Fig. 1i, j). We did not detect sexual dimorphism
in Oxtr expression within any subregion of the anterior
hippocampus.
Within the posterior hippocampus, we observed dense Oxtr
expression in pDG (Supplementary Fig. 1a). In contrast to aDG
where the majority of Oxtr cells were GABA-ergic interneurons,
>50% of Oxtr-expressing cells in pDG were Gad1− putative
mossy cells (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). Oxtr+ dentate granule
neurons were not observed in pDG. Similar to aDG, further
characterization of Oxtr+ cells revealed a mixed population of

 PV+ and SST+ cells, with a larger fraction of Oxtr+ cells
colocalizing with SST than with PV (Supplementary Fig. 1c, d).
Next we analyzed Oxtr expression within posterior CA
subfields (pCA2/3 and the dorsal and ventral segments of
pCA1, schematic shown in Fig. 1l). We observed enriched
expression of Oxtr in pCA2/3 and pCA1v; however, Oxtr
expression was comparable to the background in pCA1d
(Supplementary Fig. 1e, i, j, k). Within pCA2/3, Oxtr is
predominantly expressed in excitatory neurons of the pyramidal
cell layer, with 15–20% overlap between Oxtr and Gad1
(Supplementary Fig. 1e, f). Similar to aCA2/CA3distal, these cells
are a mixed population of PV- and SST-expressing cells, with a

 larger fraction of PV+ cells expressing Oxtr than SST+ cells
(Supplementary Fig. 1g, h). In contrast to negligible Oxtr
expression in aCA1, Oxtr expression was dense in the pyramidal
layer of the ventral segment of pCA1 (Supplementary Fig. 1k, l).
A small fraction of Oxtr+ cells colocalized with Gad1, with a
larger fraction of PV+ cells that were Oxtr+ than SST+ cells
(Supplementary Fig. 1m,n). We did not detect any sexual
dimorphism in Oxtr expression within any subregion of posterior
hippocampus.
aDG hilar Oxtrs are necessary for social discrimination. To
determine the behavioral contributions of Oxtr in aDG hilar
neurons, we utilized a conditional knockout mouse line of the
Oxtr, Oxtrf/f35, which permits Cre recombinase-dependent dele-
tion of Oxtr. We employed an AAV9 Cre-expressing virus
expressed under the control of a human Synapsin promoter, in
order to target both inhibitory interneurons and excitatory mossy
cells in aDG (Fig. 2a, b). Although previous reports indicate that
the AAV9 serotype is anterogradely transported from some
cell types, we did not observe any transport to CA3/CA256,57
(Supplementary Fig. 2a) or retrograde trafficking to brain regions
projecting to the DG (Supplementary Fig. 2b–e), as has also been
previously reported with high titre AAV9 viruses58. In order to
determine viral mediated recombination of Oxtrs, we quantified
the percentage of DAPI+cells expressing Oxtr messenger RNA in
aDG hilar neurons of Oxtr+/+ vs. Oxtrf/f mice injected with
AAV9-hSyn-Cre. Oxtr+ cells comprised 11% of all DAPI+ cells in
Oxtr+/+ mice and 6% of all DAPI+ cells in Oxtrf/f mice,
demonstrative of Oxtr recombination (Supplementary Fig. 2f, g).
Bilateral infection of Cre-expressing virus in aDG resulted in
an increased number of c-fos-expressing dentate granule neurons
following exposure to a social stimulus, suggesting a loss of
inhibition onto dentate granule neurons (unpaired t-test, green
fluorescent protein (GFP) vs. Cre: p = 0.0158, Fig. 2c). aDG Oxtr
deletion did not significantly affect performance in tests of object
exploration, novel object recognition, or social exploration
(Fig. 2d–f). Habituation to a social stimulus was modestly
impaired
(trend,
two-way
analysis
of
variance
(ANOVA),
interaction: F(2,30) = 2.613, p = 0.0899). However, aDG Oxtr
deletion resulted in a robust deficit in the social discrimination
task. Whereas control animals strongly preferred a novel
animal to a familiar animal, Cre-injected animals did not show
a preference (two-way ANOVA, treatment: F(1,15) = 0.8955,
p = 0.3590,
stimulus:
F(1,15) = 25.78,
p = 0.0001,
interaction:
F(1,15) = 10.32, p = 0.0058; Multiple comparisons, Familiar vs.
Novel, GFP: p < 0.0001, Cre: p = 0.5294, Fig. 2g). Discrimination
ratios were significantly lower in Cre animals than in GFP
animals (unpaired t-test, GFP vs Cre: p = 0.0036, Fig. 2g).
Unilateral injection of Cre into aDG was insufficient to reproduce
this effect (GFP n = 11, Cre n = 7, unpaired t-test GFP vs. Cre:
p = 0.2976). Deletion of Oxtrs in aDG did not affect measures of
innate anxiety in the open field test (OFT) or elevated plus
maze (EPM) (Supplementary Fig. 3a–c). Together, these data
demonstrate a critical role for Oxtrs in the aDG in mediating
discrimination of social, but not non-social, stimuli.
aCA2/CA3distal Oxtrs are necessary for social discrimination.
As CA2/CA3 is the primary output of the DG and Oxtrs are
densely expressed in aCA2/CA3distal, we next sought to assess the
contributions of Oxtr in aCA2/CA3distal to object and social
recognition. We preferentially targeted the principal layer of
aCA2/CA3distal of Oxtrf/f mice by employing a virus that drives
expression of Cre-recombinase under a CamKIIα promoter
(Fig. 3a, b). Cre virus was expressed predominantly in pyramidal
neurons (92.8%) and a small percentage of GABA-ergic inter-
neurons (7.3%) (Supplementary Fig. 5b). We did not observe any
retrograde or anterograde transport of Cre virus to inputs or
outputs of aCA2/CA3distal in sections immunolabeled for GFP
(Supplementary Fig. 4a–c). To determine recombination of Oxtrs
in aCA2/CA3distal, we quantified the percentage of DAPI+ cells
expressing Oxtr mRNA in aCA2/CA3distal of Oxtr+/+ vs. Oxtrf/f
mice injected with AAV9-CamKIIα-Cre. Oxtr+ cells comprised
50% of all DAPI+ cells in Oxtr+/+ mice and 25% of all DAPI+ cells
in Oxtrf/f mice (Supplementary Fig. 4d, e). Interestingly, although
we observed fewer total DAPI+ cells that were positive for Oxtr in
Oxtrf/f mice, we observed larger Oxtr puncta in cells that retained
Oxtr mRNA, suggestive of potential redistribution of transcripts.
Oxtr deletion in aCA2/CA3distal neurons did not affect object
exploration, novel object recognition, or social exploration
(Fig. 3c–e). However, although control virus (GFP) injected
mice habituated to the familiar animal over trials 1 through 3,
Cre-injected animals failed to show this habituation (two-way
ANOVA, treatment: F(1,15) = 0.2574, p = 0.6193, trial: F(2,30) =
0.6646, p = 0.5219, interaction: F(2,30) = 6.282, p = 0.0053; Multiple

tary Fig. 5a, c). Interestingly, in the EPM, we observed a decrease
in time spent in the center, a decision-making point in the maze,
at the expense of time spent in the closed arm, but not time spent
in open arms (Supplementary Fig. 5a, d).
To distinguish between the potential contribution of Oxtrs to
habituation (or acquisition) vs. retrieval in the social discrimina-
tion task, we employed pharmacological blockade of Oxtrs in vivo
only during the retrieval phase of this task. Adult male C57BL/6J
mice received a bilateral guide cannulae placed over aCA2/CA3
10 days before behavior (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b). Following
habituation and acquisition, we infused sterile saline or Oxtr
antagonist, Oxtr-A, (L-368,899 Hydrochloride, Tocris) bilaterally
into aCA2/CA3distal after Trial 3 and immediately before Trial 4.

discrimination ratios were significantly lower during Oxtr-A
infusion than during saline infusion (paired t-test, p = 0.0109,
Supplementary Fig. 6c).
Together, these experiments suggest through genetic deletion
that Oxtrs in aCA2/CA3distal are critical for social discrimination,
but not object discrimination. Furthermore, our pharmacological
blockade studies suggest that Oxtr function is necessary during
the retrieval window to mediate discrimination of social stimuli.
aCA2/CA3distal Oxtrs mediate population-based social coding.
The
DG-CA3
circuit
recruits
population-based
coding
to
encode similar memories in non-overlapping ensembles, thereby
minimizing
interference
between
similar
memories
during
storage. Such a mechanism has been shown to underlie
navigation and discrimination of similar contexts43,44,47–51, and
has been more recently shown in CA2 of rats in response to social
stimuli21. We asked whether Oxtrs in aCA2/CA3distal recruit
population based coding mechanisms to distinguish between
similar social stimuli by utilizing catFISH in combination with
viral deletion of Oxtrs in aCA2/CA3distal. This approach allows us
to visualize ensembles of neurons activated in response to
social stimuli at distinct temporal windows based on sub-cellular
localization of cFos mRNA transcripts in either the nucleus or the
cytoplasm54,55 (Fig. 4a, b and Supplementary Fig. 7). Adult male
Oxtrf/f mice were injected with AAV CamKIIα-GFP or CamKIIα-
Cre-GFP in aCA2/CA3distal 1 week before exposure to two social
stimuli: re-exposure to a single mouse (A–A), or new exposure to
a novel mouse (A–B) (four groups in total, Fig. 4c). Analysis of
cellular ensembles in CA3proximal of control animals revealed
higher percentage overlap (cells positive for both nuclear
and cytoplasmic cFos transcript are indicative of reactivation)
in the A–A condition relative to the A–B condition. In contrast,
Cre-injected animals exhibited comparable levels of re-activation
(overlap) in A–A and A–B conditions (two-way ANOVA,
treatment: F(1,15) = 0.1703, p = 0.6856, exposure: F(1,15) = 3.335,
p = 0.0878, interaction: F(1,15) = 5.917, p = 0.0280; Multiple com-
parisons, AA vs AB, GFP: p = 0.0145, Cre: p > 0.9999, Fig. 4d).
Interestingly, analysis of sub-cellular transcript localization in
CA3distal of controls and experimental groups revealed compar-
able levels of ensemble reactivation in response to A–A and A–B
conditions (Fig. 4f), consistent with reports that CA3proximal and
CA3distal are functionally distinct45,46,49. We did not observe
differences in the total number of activated cells for either
CA3proximal or CA3distal (Fig. 4e, g and Supplementary Fig.7).
Roles of aCA2/CA3 distal outputs in social discrimination.
Social information processed in aCA2/CA3distal may be relayed
via projections to aCA1, DLS, and/or pCA1 to subcortical and
prefrontal circuits, to guide social behavior59–61 (Supplementary
Figs. 8 and 10). To begin to understand how Oxtr-dependent
computations underlying social recognition performed in aCA2/
CA3distal are relayed out of the anterior hippocampus to limbic
circuits that mediate social behavior, we utilized in vivo terminal-
specific optogenetic silencing to attenuate aCA2/CA3distal outputs
to these three downstream targets. We first targeted the pathway
from aCA2/CA3distal to aCA1. We injected AAV5-CamKIIα-
eNpHR-EYFP or AAV5-CamKIIα-EYFP bilaterally into aCA2/
CA3distal of adult male mice. Three weeks post injection, bilateral
optogenetic implants were placed above aCA1. Mice were then
tested for both object behavior and social behavior (Fig. 5a–d).
Optogenetic illumination of aCA2/CA3distal terminals in aCA1 in
the test phase of novel object recognition task robustly impaired
discrimination between familiar and novel object in NpHR
animals relative to controls (two-way ANOVA, treatment:
F(1,14) = 3.783, p = 0.0721, object: F(1,14) = 28.67, p = 0.0001, inter-
action: F(1,14) = 15.88, p = 0.0014; Multiple comparisons, Object A
vs.
C,
EYFP:
p < 0.0001,
NpHR:
p = 0.6985,
Fig.
5d).
Discrimination ratios of NpHR mice were significantly lower than
controls (unpaired t-test p = 0.0029, Fig. 5d). We did not observe
any
effects
on
object
exploration,
social
exploration,
or
discrimination of social stimuli (Fig. 5c, e, f). These data suggest
that aCA2/CA3distal outputs to aCA1 are critical for object
recognition but are dispensable for discrimination of social
stimuli.
We next asked whether aCA2/CA3distal outputs to the DLS
mediate social discrimination12,14,59,60. AAV5-CamKIIα-eNpHR-
EYFP or AAV5-CamKIIα-EYFP viruses were bilaterally injected
into aCA2/CA3distal of adult male mice and bilateral optogenetic
implants were placed above the DLS (Supplementary Fig. 9a, b).
Optogenetic attenuation of terminals was confirmed by quantify-
ing the number of cFos+cells in the termination area (unpaired
t-test, p = 0.0006, Supplementary Fig. 9c). We observed a
modest enhancement in social discrimination (two-way ANOVA,
treatment: F(1,30) = 0.2753, p = 0.6037, stimulus: F(1,30) = 52.65,
p < 0.0001, interaction: F(1,30) = 4.861, p = 0.0353; Multiple com-
parisons, Familiar vs. Novel, EYFP: p = 0.0018, NpHR: p < 0.0001,
Supplementary Fig. 9g). Discrimination ratios were significantly
higher for NpHR animals than control animals (unpaired t-test,
p = 0.0121, Supplementary Fig. 9g). We did not observe any
effects on single object exploration, NOR, or social exploration
(Supplementary Fig. 9d, e, f). These data suggest that attenuation
of
aCA2/CA3distal-DLS
projections
may
modestly
promote
discrimination of social stimuli.
Recent studies have demonstrated a role for pCA1-NAcc
circuit in social discrimination25. We observed direct outputs
from aCA2/CA3distal to the dorsal segment of pCA1 (Fig. 6b)62
and confirmed the colocalization of these terminals with the
CA1 marker, WFS1 (Supplementary Fig. 10). We attenuated
these outputs by injecting AAV5-CamKIIα-eNpHR-EYFP or
AAV5-CamKIIα-EYFP into bilateral aCA2/CA3distal of adult male
mice and placing a bilateral optogenetic implant above pCA1
(Fig. 6a). Effective silencing was confirmed by quantifying the
number of cFos+cells in pCA1 below the optogenetic implant
(unpaired t-test, p = 0.0223, Fig. 6c). Optogenetic attenuation of
aCA2/CA3distal terminals in pCA1 did not affect performance in
tests of single object exploration, novel object recognition, or
social exploration (Fig. 6d–f). In contrast, optogenetic illumina-
tion of aCA2/CA3distal terminals in pCA1 in the test phase of
social discrimination task markedly impaired discrimination in
NpHR animals as compared with controls (two-way ANOVA,
treatment:
F(1,12) = 0.82,
p = 0.3830,
stimulus:
F(1,12) = 64.71,
p < 0.0001, interaction: F(1,12) = 13.4, p = 0.0033; Multiple com-
parison, Familiar vs. Novel, EYFP: p < 0.0001, NpHR: p = 0.0184,
Fig. 6g). Discrimination ratios were also significantly lower
for NpHR animals as compared with controls (unpaired t-test,
p = 0.0006, Fig. 6g). Together, these data suggest that aCA2/
CA3distal projections to pCA1 relay social information to
subcortical and prefrontal circuits to guide social behavior.
Discussion
Social recognition, the ability to recognize and distinguish
between conspecifics is essential to the formation and stability of
social interactions across species. As such, it is not surprising
that cortical and subcortical circuits must communicate to
support efficient social recognition. Remarkably, despite studies

 implicating Oxtrs in different brain regions in social recognition,
the role of Oxtrs in the hippocampus has remained unaddressed.
Here we identify a role for a aDG-CA2/CA3 axis of Oxtr-
expressing cells in discrimination of social, but not non-social,
stimuli. Further, Oxtr deletion in aDG and aCA2/CA3distal did
not affect object behaviors or social interaction suggesting a
specific role for Oxtrs in fine discrimination of social stimuli,
consistent with phenotype
of mice lacking
Oxtrs in the
forebrain34. Our findings are consistent with a general role of the
aDG-CA3 circuit of the hippocampus in resolving interference
between similar memories37,61,63,64. The lack of an effect of Oxtr
deletion in aDG-CA2/CA3 in object recognition suggests that the
same aDG-CA2/CA3 memory circuit scaffold has been co-opted
by an ancient evolutionarily conserved neuromodulatory system,
OT-Oxtr, to permit encoding when OT is released (such as
during encounter of social stimuli)13.
Recent studies have suggested that CA2 links social informa-
tion with space or contextual information21. However, whether
CA3 exhibits population-based coding in response to similar
social stimuli or whether Oxtr engages such population-based
coding mechanisms to promote social discrimination is not
known. Using catFISH based ensemble imaging we found that the
CA3proximal, but not CA3distal, subregion exhibits population-
based coding when mice encountered similar, but not the same,
social stimuli. The lack of population-based coding in CA3distal
may be explained by changes in firing rate that are not detectable
with catFISH. Caveats notwithstanding, these findings are con-
sistent with growing evidence that under conditions of high input
similarity (as is the case here with mice of the same genetic
background) CA3proximal, but not CA3distal, performs population-
based coding45,46,49. Preferential removal of Oxtrs of aCA2/CA3
pyramidal
neurons
impaired
population
based
coding
in
CA3proximal, suggesting that OT recruits basic circuit mechanisms
normally used by CA3proximal to support orthogonalization of
similar inputs into divergent outputs (pattern separation) to
minimize overlap between social stimuli. These findings are

 consistent with previous reports that identify functional hetero-
geneity among CA3 subregions, with CA3proximal behaving as a
pattern separator, much similar to the DG, and CA3distal, strongly
influenced by its auto-associative networks, functioning as a
pattern completion network45,46,49,65. However, that we see a
disruption in population based coding in CA3proximal, despite low
Oxtr expression in this region, suggests a role for local
microcircuits within CA3 that communicate social information
mediated by OT signaling in aCA2/CA3distal to pattern separation
networks in CA3proximal.

ification of the functions of Oxtr in aCA2 or aCA3 excitatory

cells) cells in the hilus will further edify the contributions of Oxtrs

 discrimination of social stimuli. The modest levels of dis-
crimination of social stimuli that were persistent following
optogenetic attenuation of aCA2/CA3 projections to pCA1 may
reflect insufficient illumination of the large termination zone in
pCA1d, incomplete silencing, and/or lack of targeting just the
Oxtr-expressing neurons in aCA2/3. Nevertheless, these results
are consistent with a recent study implicating the pCA1-NAcc
pathway in mediating discrimination of social stimuli. Whether
this pathway or other pCA1 projections to prefrontal cortex,
hypothalamus, or amygdala relay Oxtr-dependent computations
underlying social recognition in anterior hippocampus to guide
social
behavior
remains
to
be
determined.
Our
findings
that aCA2/CA3 projections to aCA1 mediate discrimination of
non-social, but not social, stimuli are consistent with the role of
aCA1 in object recognition27,28. Thus, social and non-social
information maybe differentially routed out of aCA2/CA3 to
aCA1 or pCA1. Differential routing may be dependent on
engagement of OT signaling in microcircuits in aCA2/CA3 or
differences in projection patterns of Oxtr-expressing aCA2/CA3
neurons to aCA1 and pCA1.
In summary, our studies begin to illuminate the circuit
mechanisms and neural pathways by which hippocampal Oxtrs
contribute to social recognition. Oxtrs appear to recruit basic
circuit mechanisms supporting pattern separation such as
population based coding to minimize interference between
similar social memories. These cognitive computations are
relayed from the anterior to posterior hippocampus via an aCA2/
CA3-pCA1 pathway to guide social behavior. Thus, disruptions in
DG-CA2/CA3
circuitry
may
contribute
to
social

disorders1–3,68–70.
Methods
Mouse lines and animal care. Two strains of mice were used in these experiments.
Multiplex FISH and optogenetic terminal-specific silencing experiments were
carried out in C57Bl/6J mice. Oxtr conditional knockout mice (Oxtrf/f) rederived at
Jackson Labs were utilized for viral-mediated recombination of Oxtrs35(Jackson
Laboratories stock 008471). All experiments were carried out in adult male mice
(8 weeks old). All mice were housed three to five per cage in standard laboratory
conditions under a 12 h light–dark cycle (0700–1700 h) with ad libitum access to
food and water. Behavioral testing occurred during the light cycle. All experiments
were carried out in accordance with procedures approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee at the Massachusetts General Hospital in
accordance with NIH guidelines.
Multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization. FISH was carried out using
ACDBio RNAscope multiplex fluorescence assay. Probes were obtained as fol-
lowing: C1: PV (Mm-Pvalb: 421931), Cre (CRE: 312281), C2: Oxtr (Mm-Oxtr-C2:
402651-C2), C3: Gad1 (Mm-Gad1-C3: 400951-C3), and SST (Mm-Sst-C3: 404631-
C3). Brain tissue was obtained from age-matched 8-10 week-old male and female
C57BL/6J mice and immediately fresh-frozen in optimal cutting temperature
(OCT) medium on dry ice. For the assessment of Oxtr knockout, Oxtr+/+ and
Oxtrf/f mice were injected in aDG or aCA2/CA3 with AAV-CRE (AAV-hSyn Cre-
GFP, diluted 1 : 100, 0.3 μl bilaterally, in aDG and AAV9-CamKII-Cre-GFP 1 : 5
dilution, 0.3 μl bilaterally in aCA2.3). Twenty-micrometer sections were obtained
using a cryostat (Leica, Germany) and stored at − 80 °C. Before RNAscope pro-
tocol, sections were incubated at − 20 °C for 1 h. RNAscope protocol was followed
as indicated in user manual with adjustments as mentioned here. Briefly, sections
were fixed with 4% chilled paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 30 or 60 min and rinsed in
1 × phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 5 min. Sections were then dehydrated in
four 5 min dehydration steps in 50%, 75%, 100%, and 100% ethanol, respectively.
Tissue was digested with Protease III for 30 min at room temperature and rinsed in
1 × PBS. Oxtr and Gad1 probes were diluted 1 : 50 in probe diluent and pipetted
onto each slide. Oxtr and SST probes were diluted 1 : 50 in PV C1 probe and
pipetted onto each slide. For assessment of OxtR knockout, Oxtr probe was diluted
1 : 50 in Cre C1 probe. Probe hybridization took place for 2 h at 40 °C and slides
were then rinsed in 1 × wash buffer. Sections were then incubated at 40 °C in Amp1
for 30 min, Amp 2 for 15 min, Amp3 for 30 min, and Amp4 for 15 min, with 1 ×
Wash Buffer rinses between each incubation. Sections were finally mounted with
DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) Fluoromount and stored at − 20 °C.
Adeno-associated viruses (AAV). AAV5-CaMKIIα-eYFP (6 × 1012 particles per
mL) and AAV5-CaMKIIα-eNpHR3.0-eYFP (3 × 1012 particles per mL) viruses
were generated by and obtained from the University of North Carolina Vector
Core (Chapel Hill, NC). AAV9-CamKIIα-Cre-GFP (1.07 × 1013 particles per mL),
AAV9-CamKIIα-GFP (6.27 × 1013 particles per mL) and AAV9-hSyn-Cre-GFP
(11.7 × 1013 particles per mL) were generated by and obtained from the University
of Pennsylvania Vector Core (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania).
Stereotactic surgery. Viral injections: adult mice (8 weeks old) were maintained
under standard housing conditions. Mice were given carprofen (5 mg kg−1
subcutaneously) before surgery and 24 h later to minimize discomfort. Mice were
anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine (10 and 1.6 mg mL−1, intraperitoneally
(i.p.)) and placed in a stereotaxic frame (Stoelting). Small holes were drilled at
each injection location and injected with a Hamilton microsyringe at a rate of
0.1 μl min−1. For aDG KO experiment, 0.2 μl 1 : 1,000 AAV9-hSyn-Cre-GFP or
1 : 50 AAV9-CamKIIα-GFP was injected bilaterally (AP − 1.9 mm, ML ± 1.1 mm,
DV − 2.6 mm from Bregma) into Oxtr f/f mice. For aCA2/CA3distalKO experi-
ments, 0.3 μl 1:50 AAV9-CamKIIα-Cre-GFP or 1 : 50 AAV9-CamKIIα-GFP was
injected bilaterally (AP − 1.9 mm, ML ± 2.55 mm, DV − 2.3 mm from Bregma) into
Oxtr f/f mice. For optogenetic silencing experiments, 0.3 μl undiluted AAV5-
CaMKIIα-eNpHR3.0-eYFP or AAV5-CaMKIIα-eYFP was injected bilaterally into
aCA2/CA3distal. After completion of the injection, the needle was left on the site of
injection for 5 min, raised 0.2 mm, and left on the site for an additional 5 min, to
allow diffusion of virus at the injection site and then slowly withdrawn. The skin
incision was closed carefully using nylon sutures. Animals were monitored during
recovery.
Optogenetic implants: mice were surgically implanted with fiber optic cannulas
3–4 weeks following injection of AAV5-CaMKIIα-eYFP or AAV5-CaMKIIα-
eNpHR3.0-eYFP and behavioral experiments started 1 week after surgery. Mice
were implanted bilaterally with chronically dwelling optical fibers targeted to the
anterior CA1 (AP − 1.9 mm, ML ± 1.5 mm, DV − 1.2 mm from Bregma), pCA1
(AP − 3.35 mm, ML ± 3.1 mm, DV − 1.7 mm from Bregma), or DLS (AP +
1.15 mm, ML ± 1.0 mm angle ± 10°, DV − 2.5 mm from Bregma). Optical fibers
were secured with one cranial screw and dental cement. After surgery, mice were
returned to their home cage and monitored until recovery from surgery.
Construction of optical fibers. Two hundred micrometer core, 0.37 numerical
aperture multimode fiber (ThorLabs) was threaded through and glued with epoxy
to a 230 μm core stainless steel or zirconia multimode ferrule (Fiber Instrument
Sales and Precision Fiber Products), polished, and cut for implantation. Optical
patch cables were generated the same way, with the free end connected to a
multimode FC ferrule assembly for connecting to a 1 × 2 Optical rotary joint
(Doric lenses). The other end of the rotary joint was connected via a patch cable to
a 561 nm laser diode (OEM laser systems) via a non-contact style laser to fiber
coupler (OZ optics).
In vivo laser delivery. Age-matched, genotyped-matched male mice (3–4 months
old) were used for all behavioral experiments. Mice were kept in a quiet room for at
least 1 h before testing. Behavioral tests took place under bright lighting conditions
(700 lux) and performed in the following order: single object exploration (day 1),
novel object recognition (day 2), social exploration (day 3), and social dis-
crimination (day 4). Before each experiment, mice were bilaterally attached to the
patch cables via a zirconia sleeve and allowed to recover for 2–3 min in a transition

 cage similar to their home cage. The patch cables were interfaced to an FC/PC
rotary joint (Doric lenses), which was attached on the other end to a laser diode
(561 nm). The light power at the end of the fiber tip was 10–15 mW. At the end of
each behavioral experiment (5–7 weeks following viral surgery), mice were
analyzed for viral and fiber optics placement and mis-targeted animals were
excluded from the analysis. In aCA2/CA3-CA1 attenuation experiment, animal
numbers varied across behavioral tasks because of loss of optogenetic implants
during course of testing and two behavioral cohorts were utilized, with the second
cohort being used for a context-updating task instead of social discrimination after
social exploration. Randomly selected videos were scored by two different
investigators.
Single object exploration. Mice were placed an arena filled with bedding (45 cm
long, 15 cm high and 30 cm wide) with a single novel object for 5 min. Sessions
were video-recorded and videos were manually scored for object exploration (when
an animal’s snout was 2 cm or less from the object) by an investigator blind to
animal treatment identity. For optogenetic experiments, light of 561 nm was turned
on for the full duration of the session.
Novel object recognition. Mice were placed in an arena filled with bedding (45 cm
long, 15 cm high and 30 cm wide) with two distinct objects (A and B) for three
5 min sessions, with a 5 min intertrial interval. Mice habituated to the objects
during the three training sessions and one of the objects was subsequently replaced
with a novel object (C) in session four. Objects were counterbalanced across
subjects and object positions were counterbalanced across trials. The objects that
were selected for testing elicited comparable levels of exploration based on
exploration levels in pilot experiments. Sessions were video-recorded and videos
were manually scored for object exploration (when an animal’s snout was 2 cm or
less from the object) by an investigator blind to object identity and animal treat-
ment identity. For optogenetic experiments, light of 561 nm was turned on only
during trial 4.
Social exploration. Mice were placed in an open plexiglass arena (41 cm × 41 cm,
Kinder Scientific) for 5 min with two pencil-wire cups placed on opposing corners
of the arena. Habituation to the chamber took place one day before the start of
behavioral testing. One cup remained empty, whereas the other contained a novel
adult male C57Bl/6J mouse. Sessions were video-recorded and videos were
manually scored for exploration of the social cup and empty cup (direct snout-to-
cup contact, with at least two paws on the ground—time spent climbing on the cup
was not included) by an investigator blind to animal treatment identity. Stimulus
mice were trained to sit in pencil-wire cups for three 15 min sessions several days
before behavioral testing. For optogenetic experiments, light of 561 nm was turned
on for the full duration of the session.
Social recognition (habituation and discrimination). The same plexiglass arena
and pencil-wire cup set-up as described for social exploration was used. Mice were
placed in the arena for three 5 min sessions with an empty cup and a novel adult
male C57Bl/6J mouse, with a 5 min intertrial interval. Mice habituated to the
stimulus during the first three sessions, rendering it “familiar.” During trial 4, a
novel adult male mouse was placed in the opposing cup and subjects were tested
for discrimination between the novel and familiar mouse. Social stimuli were
counterbalanced across subjects and the position of the familiar social stimulus was
counterbalanced across trials. Sessions were video-recorded and videos were
manually scored for interaction with the novel vs familiar mouse (direct snout-to-
cup contact, with at least two paws on the ground—time spent climbing on the cup
was not included) by an investigator blind to animal treatment identity. Stimulus
mice were trained to sit in pencil-wire cups for three 15 min sessions several days
before behavioral testing. For optogenetic experiments, light of 561 nm was turned
on only during trial 4. Videos were scored by two different investigators.
aDG genetic deletion cohorts. For Fig. 2 and the corresponding Supplementary
Fig. 3, number of animals is variable across behaviors, because two different
cohorts were used. The first cohort (n = 7, 4) was used for all behaviors and cFos
analysis. The second cohort (n = 4, 2) was used to increase the N for the four
behaviors in the main Figure, but was not used for anxiety (OFT and EPM) or cFos
analysis.
catFISH assay. The catFISH assay was performed as previously described47.
Briefly, adult male Oxtr f/f mice received bilateral stereotactic injections of AAV9-
CamKIIα-Cre-GFP diluted at 1 : 50 into aCA2/CA3distal 10 days before behavior, as
described above. Animals experienced two 5 min behavioral episodes 25 min apart
and brains were isolated and flash frozen in isopentane on dry ice immediately after
the second episode. An intronic c-fos probe containing the entire first intron of the
Fos gene54 (generous gift of Dr. Dayu Lin) and a full-length c-fos cRNA probe
were used to detect nuclear and cytoplasmic c-fos transcripts, respectively. Nuclear
c-fos was defined as puncta colocalizing with DAPI labeling, whereas cytoplasmic
labeling was defined as c-fos-positive labeling surrounding the nucleus. CA3proximal
comprised an region of interest (ROI) with a volume of 788,546 cubic micrometers
per section and contained on average 521.67 DAPI+ cells (n = 3). CA3distal
comprised an ROI with a volume of 1,216,503 cubic micrometers per section
and contained an average of 554.67 DAPI+ cells (n = 3). CA2 was not quantified
due to too few cFos+ foci for analysis (on average two cFos+ cells per section).
Representative images of each condition are included in.
Histology and immunohistochemistry. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine
(100 mg kg−1 i.p.) and xylazine (3 mg kg−1 i.p.), and transcardially perfused with
10 mM PBS, pH 7.5 at 4 °C, followed by a fixative solution containing 4% PFA in
PBS. Brains were post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4 °C and cryo-protected for
72 h in 30% sucrose at 4 °C before freezing in OCT on dry ice. Coronal sections
were obtained at 35 μm using a cryostat (Leica, Germany) in six matched sets.
Sections were stored in 1 × PBS with 0.01% Azide at 4 °C. Floating sections were
used to perform immunohistochemical labeling. Briefly, sections were washed in
1 × PBS, incubated for 15 min at room temperature in 1 × PBS containing 0.3%
Triton X-100, blocked in 1 × PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 10% Normal
donkey serum for 1 h at room temperature, and incubated in primary antibodies in
blocking buffer with shaking overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies were used as
follows: GFP (rabbit anti-GFP, Life Technologies A11122, 1 : 500, Antibodyregistry.
org: AB_221569); goat anti-GFP, Novus Biologicals, NB100-1770, 1 : 500, (Anti-
bodyregistry.org: AB_10128178), cFos (Rabbit, Santa Cruz, 1 : 2,000, Santa Cruz
SC52, Antibodyregistry.org: AB_2106783), RGS14 (Mouse, UC Davis/NIH Neu-
roMab, 1 : 400). The following day, sections were washed three times in 1 × PBS
and incubated with fluorescent-label-coupled secondary antibodies (Jackson
Immunoresearch, Donkey anti-Rabbit, Goat, or Mouse, 488-, Cy3-, or Cy5-
coupled, 1 : 500) for 2 h at room temperature.
cFos and perfusion. Mice were exposed to a novel social stimulus in a novel arena
filled with bedding for 5 min and promptly returned to home cage. Mice were then
anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg kg−1 i.p.) and xylazine (3 mg kg−1 i.p.), and
transcardially perfused 60 min post exposure, as described above in “Histology and
immunohistochemistry.” For optogenetic silencing cFos experiments, mice were
given 3–5 min to acclimate after being bilaterally attached to a laser patch cord,
before the laser was turned on and social exposure began.
Image acquisition and analysis. For RNAscope multiplex FISH: × 20, × 40, or
× 60 confocal z-stack images were obtained with a Nikon A1R Si confocal laser.
Images were acquired at 1,024 resolution as 10 μm z-stacks with a step size of 2 μm.
For colocalization analysis, cells were manually identified as Oxtr+, Gad1+, SST+,
and/or PV+ or double positive, and expressed as a percentage of Oxtr+ cells (for
DG) or as a percentage of SST+, or PV+ cells (for CA2/CA3). For Oxtr knockdown
analysis, all DAPI nuclei per image were counted (for DG injections: cells in the
hilus, excluding granule cell layer and CA3, were counted, whereas for CA2/CA3
injections cells in the CA2/CA3 principal cell layer were counted), and cells were
manually identified as Oxtr+, Cre+, and/or OxtR+CRE+ double positive. The Oxtr+
population was expressed as a percentage of total DAPI cells. For Oxtr mean
intensity calculated for CA regions, mean intensity was measured for the region
comprised by the principal layer. A similar sized region from background area was
measured for intensity and subtracted from mean Oxtr intensity, in order to
control for differences in background.
For cFos analysis: × 10 bilateral images were acquired using a Nikon
epifluorescence microscope. cFos+ cells were manually quantified as those with
intensity higher than background in the aDG granule cell layer, pCA1 pyramidal
cell layer directly under the implant, and DLS. For aDG, both blades were assessed.
Data were expressed as # cFos+ cells per section. All quantifications and analyses
were completed by an experimenter blind to treatment condition.
For catFISH: confocal z-stack images using a × 60 oil objective (1.0 μm step size)
were acquired along the aCA2/CA3 pyramidal layer using a Nikon A1R Si confocal
laser, a TiE inverted research microscope, and NIS Elements software. Image
analysis was performed with NIS Elements software. Four to eight hemisections
were scanned per mouse. Images were manually counted for c-fos transcript
labeling. Data are presented as cells/section. Quantifications were performed by an
investigator blind to treatment condition and two different investigators. Details of
OFT, EPM, and pharmacological blockade of Oxtrs can be found in Supplementary
Note 1.
Statistics. Statistical analysis was carried out using GraphPad Prism v7 software.
Data (mean ± SEM) were analyzed using paired or unpaired two-tailed Student’s
t-test, to compare two groups. Behavioral data were analyzed using mixed factor
two-way ANOVA with repeated measure followed by Bonferroni’s multiple
comparisons test when the interaction, p-value was < 0.05. Detailed statistical
analyses can be found in Supplementary Table 1. In all cases, significance was set at
p < 0.05.
Data availability. All relevant data are available from the authors.
