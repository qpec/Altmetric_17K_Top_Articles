In Brief
Magkos et al. demonstrate the profound
therapeutic effects of weight loss on
metabolic function in subjects with
obesity. Even a moderate 5% weight loss
has considerable health benefits,
including decreased intra-abdominal and
intra-hepatic fat and increased multi-
organ insulin sensitivity and b cell
function. Additional weight loss further
improves many cardiometabolic
outcomes.

SUMMARY
Although 5%–10% weight loss is routinely recom-
mended for people with obesity, the precise effects
of 5% and further weight loss on metabolic health
are unclear. We conducted a randomized controlled
trial that evaluated the effects of 5.1% ± 0.9%
(n = 19), 10.8% ± 1.3% (n = 9), and 16.4% ± 2.1%
(n = 9) weight loss and weight maintenance (n = 14)
on metabolic outcomes. 5% weight loss improved
adipose tissue, liver and muscle insulin sensitivity,
and b cell function, without a concomitant change
in systemic or subcutaneous adipose tissue markers
of
inflammation.
Additional
weight
loss
further
improved b cell function and insulin sensitivity in
muscle and caused stepwise changes in adipose
tissue mass, intrahepatic triglyceride content, and
adipose tissue expression of genes involved in
cholesterol flux, lipid synthesis, extracellular matrix
remodeling, and oxidative stress. These results
demonstrate that moderate 5% weight loss im-
proves metabolic function in multiple organs simul-
taneously, and progressive weight loss causes
dose-dependent alterations in key adipose tissue
biological pathways.
INTRODUCTION
Obesity is associated with a constellation of cardiometabolic
abnormalities including insulin resistance, b cell dysfunction,
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, dyslipidemia, and hypertension,
which are important risk factors for the development of serious
medical complications such as type 2 diabetes and coronary
heart disease (Klein et al., 2002; Kopelman, 2000). Most treat-
ment guidelines, including those recently proposed by several
major medical and scientific societies, recommend moderate
weight loss of 5%–10% to achieve improvements in metabolic
function and health outcomes (Jensen et al., 2014). However, it
is much easier to achieve a 5% weight loss than it is to achieve
a 10% weight loss, so it is important to understand the cardio-
metabolic benefits that occur with a 5% weight loss and what
additional benefits, if any, can be expected with more weight
loss in people with obesity. Several large randomized controlled
weight loss trials retrospectively evaluated the effects of different
amounts of weight loss on clinical outcomes (Wing et al., 1987;
Wing et al., 2011). However, the weight loss stratification used
in these studies combined the results from subjects who lost
5% through 10% of their body weight into one group; we are
not aware of any trials that separated the weight loss outcomes
in those who achieved 5% from those who achieved 10% weight
loss, either prospectively or retrospectively.
The mechanism(s) responsible for the beneficial effects of
weight loss on cardiometabolic outcomes is not known but
presumably involves a reversal of the mechanism(s) responsible
for the adverse effects of weight gain. It has been proposed that
a pathological expansion of adipose tissue mass causes an
increase in adipose tissue inflammation, manifested by alter-
ations in adipose tissue immune cell populations and increased
gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemo-
kines, which cause systemic inflammation and insulin resistance
(Berg and Scherer, 2005; Ferrante, 2007; Hotamisligil, 2006; Sun
et al., 2013). However, the importance of decreasing adipose
tissue and systemic inflammation in the beneficial metabolic
effects of weight loss is unclear because of conflicting results
from different studies, reporting decreases, increases, and no
changes in markers of inflammation after diet-induced weight
loss (Capel et al., 2009; Cle
´ ment et al., 2004; Dahlman et al.,
2005; Johansson et al., 2012; Mali�
sova
´ et al., 2014; Sola
´ et al.,
2009). Therefore, a simultaneous assessment of the effects of
moderate weight loss on metabolic function and adipose tissue
inflammation in people with obesity could help elucidate the po-
tential physiological significance of inflammation on metabolic
dysfunction.
The purpose of the present study was to conduct a ran-
domized controlled trial in persons who are obese and have
evidence of insulin-resistant glucose metabolism to determine:

 outcomes, including body composition (total body fat mass,
intra-abdominal fat volume, and intrahepatic triglyceride con-
tent), 24 hr ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate, plasma
lipid profile, b cell function, and multi-organ (adipose tissue,
liver, and muscle) insulin sensitivity; (2) whether 5% weight
loss-induced cardiometabolic benefits are associated with a
reduction in systemic or subcutaneous adipose tissue markers
of inflammation; and (3) the effects of progressive 5%, 10%,
and 15% weight loss on cardiometabolic outcomes and global
adipose tissue gene expression profile.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Weight Loss Targets Were Effectively Achieved
40 subjects were randomized to either weight maintenance
(n = 20; 14 completed [five withdrew after being informed of
their randomization and one subsequently dropped out], 46 ±
13 years old, 11 women and 3 men) or diet-induced weight
loss (n = 20; 19 completed [one dropped out], 43 ± 11 years
old; 16 women and 3 men) (Figure S1). 19 subjects in the weight
loss group achieved the initial targeted 5% weight loss (5.1% ±
0.9% actual weight loss); 9 of these subjects (44 ± 12 years old;
8 women and 1 man) successfully achieved the subsequent
weight loss targets of �10% and �15% (the actual mean weight
losses achieved were 10.8% ± 1.3% and 16.4% ± 2.1%). Sub-
jects were studied when they were weight stable (<2% weight
change for at least 3 weeks; Figure S2) before and after a median
(quartiles) of 6.1 (5.9, 6.7) months in the weight maintenance
group and after 5% weight loss at 3.5 (2.9, 4.6) months, 11%
weight loss at 6.8 (6.0, 8.6) months, and 16% weight loss at
10.4 (9.6, 11.4) months in the weight loss group.
5% Weight Loss Improves Body Composition and
Multiple Risk Factors for Cardiometabolic Disease, and
Progressive Weight Loss Causes further Benefits
5% weight loss resulted in a 2% ± 2% decrease in fat-free mass
(FFM), an 8% ± 3% decrease in body fat mass, a 7% ± 12%
decrease in intra-abdominal adipose tissue (IAAT) volume, and
a 40% ± 21% decrease in intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) con-
tent (Table 1). 5% weight loss significantly decreased the plasma
concentrations of some risk factors for cardiometabolic disease
(glucose, insulin, triglyceride, alanine transaminase, and leptin)

 but did not affect others (free fatty acids, low- and high-density
lipoprotein [LDL and HDL, respectively] cholesterol, and adipo-
nectin) (Table 1). 5% weight loss decreased 24 hr ambulatory
heart rate and 24 hr ambulatory systolic, but not diastolic,
blood pressure (Table 1). The reductions in FFM, fat mass,
IAAT volume, IHTG content, fasting plasma insulin, leptin, and
triglyceride concentrations continued with progressive weight
loss up to 16% of initial body weight in a predominantly linear
fashion, whereas plasma free fatty acid and CRP concentrations
decreased and plasma adiponectin concentration increased
significantly only after 16% weight loss (Table 2).
5% Weight Loss Improves Multi-organ Insulin
Sensitivity, and Progressive Weight Loss Has Organ-
Specific and Dose-Dependent Effects
5% weight loss did not affect standard measures of glycemic
control evaluated by using the oral glucose tolerance test
(OGTT), including the 2 hr plasma glucose concentration and
total glucose area under the curve (AUC) (Table 3). In contrast,
more sensitive measures of organ-specific insulin action,
assessed by using a two-stage hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic
clamp procedure in conjunction with infusion of stable isotopi-
cally labeled tracers, demonstrated an improvement in adipose
tissue insulin sensitivity (insulin-mediated suppression of palmi-
tate rate of appearance [Ra] in plasma), liver insulin sensitivity
(insulin-mediated suppression of glucose Ra in plasma), and
skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity (insulin-mediated stimulation
of glucose rate of disappearance [Rd] from plasma) (Table 3).
The improvements in insulin-mediated suppression of palmitate
Ra and glucose Ra plateaued after 5% weight loss, whereas
insulin-mediated stimulation of glucose Rd increased further
with 11%–16% weight loss (Table 4).
These data show that the relationship between weight loss
and improvement in insulin sensitivity is organ specific; maximal
benefits in insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose
production and adipose tissue lipolytic activity occur after 5%
weight loss, whereas insulin-stimulated muscle glucose uptake
continues to increase with greater amounts of weight loss.
In addition, these results help clarify the relationship between
weight loss and skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity. The minimum
amount of weight loss needed to increase skeletal muscle insulin
sensitivity has been unclear because of conflicting data from
different studies reporting either no change or increased insu-
lin-stimulated glucose uptake after 6%–8% weight loss (Kirk
et al., 2009; Petersen et al., 2005; Petersen et al., 2012). How-
ever, those studies were conducted in small numbers of sub-
jects, which might have limited their ability to detect statistically
significant effects. Our results, obtained from a much larger
group, demonstrate that 5% weight loss increases insulin-
stimulated glucose uptake by �25% in people who are obese
and have some degree of insulin resistance, but not diabetes.
Furthermore, skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity continued to

 increase with greater weight loss. Although a maximal 2-fold in-
crease in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was observed after
11%–16% weight loss in our subjects, we cannot exclude the
possibility that greater weight loss would result in even greater
improvement. However, we previously found that 20% weight
loss induced by bariatric surgery also caused a 2-fold increase
in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (Bradley et al., 2012), sug-
gesting that most of the beneficial effect of weight loss on muscle
insulin action in people occurs after an 11%–16% decline in
body weight.
Weight Loss Increases Insulin Clearance and Improves
b Cell Function
5% weight loss significantly increased insulin clearance rate but
did not affectindices of insulin secretion, determined by modeling
the data from the OGTT, including insulin concentration AUC, in-
sulin secretion rate AUC, and b cell responsivity (F-dynamic,
which is a measure of insulin secretion in response to the rate of
change in glucose concentration; F-static, which is a measure
of insulin secretion in response to a given glucose concentration;
and F-total, which is a measure of the total insulin secretory
response) (Table 3). However, 5% weight loss improved overall
b cell function, determined by an assessment of insulin secretion
in response to glucose ingestion in relationship to insulin sensi-
tivity (product of F-total during the OGTT and the relative increase
in insulin-stimulated glucose disposal during the hyperinsuline-
mic euglycemic clamp procedure) (Table 3). Progressive weight
loss decreased insulin AUC during the OGTT after 16% weight
loss but did not affect the insulin secretory response to plasma
glucose (F-static, F-dynamic, and F-total indices of b cell re-
sponsivity and total insulin secretion rate AUC) (Table 4). These
results suggest the decrease in plasma insulin concentration
was primarily due to an increase in insulin clearance, not a
decrease in insulin secretion. The overall index of b cell function
increased with progressive weight loss in concert with the
improvement in muscle insulin sensitivity (Table 4).
The assessment of overall b cell function is more informative
than simply measuring the insulin secretory response alone
because the insulin secretion rate and plasma insulin concen-
tration needed to maintain normal glucose homeostasis de-
pends on a person’s sensitivity to insulin (Bergman et al.,
2002). Accordingly, a lower plasma insulin concentration is
needed to maintain normal glucose homeostasis in insulin-
sensitive compared to insulin-resistant people, and a compen-
satory increase in insulin secretion can maintain normal glucose
homeostasis in those who are insulin resistant. The improvement
in overall b cell function observed in our subjects was primarily
due to an increase in insulin sensitivity without a significant
change in the insulin secretory response to plasma glucose.
However, plasma insulin concentrations in response to glucose
ingestion decreased with progressive weight loss because of a
progressive increase in insulin clearance. Weight loss-induced
changes in b cell function have important clinical implications
in preventing and treating type 2 diabetes: impaired b cell

5% Weight Loss Does Not Affect Systemic or
Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue Markers of Inflammation,
but Progressive Weight Loss Causes Progressive
Changes in Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue Metabolic
Pathways Involved in Regulating Lipid Metabolism,
Extracellular Matrix Remodeling, and Oxidative Stress
Markers of inflammation in the systemic circulation (plasma
concentrations of interleukin-6 [IL-6], C-reactive protein [CRP],
and white blood cell [WBC] count) and in subcutaneous adipose
tissue (gene expression of IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant
protein-1 [MCP1], and CD68) were increased in subjects with
obesity compared with a group of lean adults that we studied
previously (Yoshino et al., 2012) (Table S1 and Figure S3). How-
ever, 5% weight loss did not decrease the plasma concentra-
tions of several circulating inflammatory markers, such as IL-6,
MCP1, CRP, or WBC count (Table 1), and did not significantly
alter, or tend to increase, subcutaneous adipose tissue gene
expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and tumor
necrosis factor (TNF), major chemokines (MCP1 and regulated
on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted [RANTES]),
and macrophage markers (CD68 and EMR1) (Figure 1).
Parametric analysis of gene-set enrichment (PAGE) was per-
formed on microarray data to determine global transcriptional
changes in abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue induced
by progressive weight loss (Figure 2A and Table S2). Biolog-
ical pathways related to lipid flux (e.g., REACTOME_HDL_
MEDIATED_LIPID_TRANSPORTandREACTOME_LIPOPROTEIN_
METABOLISM) were significantly upregulated by weight loss,
whereas numerous pathways related to lipid synthesis (e.g.,
KEGG_BIOSYNTHESIS_OF_UNSATURATED_FATTY_ACIDS
and
REACTOME_TRIGLYCERIDE_BIOSYNTHESIS),
extra-
cellular matrix (ECM) remodeling (e.g., NABA_MATRISOME,
REACTOME_CELL_EXTRACELLULAR_MATRIX_INTERACTIONS,
and KEGG_FOCAL_ADHESION), and oxidative stress (e.g.,
OXIDOREDUCTASE_ACTIVITYand RESPONSE_TO_OXIDATIVE_
STRESS) were markedly downregulated by weight loss (Fig-
ure 2B). Consistent with these alterations in biological pathways,
progressive weight loss caused a progressive increase in subcu-
taneous adipose tissue expression of genes involved in choles-
terol flux (ABCG1, ABCA1, APOE, and CETP) and a progressive
decrease in adipose tissue expression of genes involved in lipid
synthesis (SCD, FADS1, FADS2, and ELOVL6), ECM remodeling
(SPARC, MAFP5, LOX, LOXL2, ANGPT1, and ADAM12), and
oxidative stress (NQO1, DHCR24, and UCHL1) (Figure 2C). In
addition,
progressive
weight
loss
moderately
decreased
(COL3A1) or did not affect (COL1A1 and COL6A1) gene expres-
sion of ECM structural markers and decreased gene expression
of selected markers of adipogenesis (PPARG and CEBPA) in sub-
cutaneous adipose tissue (Figures S4A and S4B, respectively).

 There was also a trend toward an increase in subcutaneous
adipose tissue biological pathways involved in immune function
and
inflammation
(e.g.,
REACTOME_ADAPTIVE_IMMUNE_
SYSTEM, REACTOME_IMMUNE_SYSTEM, IMMUNE_SYSTEM_
PROCESS) after 5% weight loss, followed by a subsequent
decline in these pathways with progressive weight loss and
a significant decrease after 16% weight loss (Figure S4C).
Progressive weight loss tended to downregulate subcutane-
ous adipose tissue expression of genes involved in inflamma-
tion after 11%–16% weight loss (Figure S4D).
Our findings demonstrate that adipose tissue is a dynamic or-
gan that is extraordinarily responsive to diet-induced weight
loss. Adipose tissue biological pathways and genes involved in
cholesterol flux progressively increased, whereas those involved
in lipid synthesis, ECM remodeling, and oxidative stress pro-
gressively decreased, with continued 5%–16% weight loss.
Data from studies conducted in rodent models demonstrate
that adipocyte-specific genetic manipulation of many of the
same metabolic pathways that were affected by diet-induced
weight loss in our subjects, namely the cholesterol transporter
ABCA1 (de Haan et al., 2014), regulators of cellular oxidative
stress (Chutkow et al., 2010; Xue et al., 2013), and production
of ECM components (Halberg et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2013),
can influence insulin sensitivity and whole-body glucose and
lipid metabolism. Moreover, it was recently shown that increased
adipose tissue markers of oxidative stress are associated with
high-calorie diet-induced insulin resistance in people (Boden
et al., 2015). Although our study cannot determine whether
the weight loss-induced changes in adipose tissue biological
pathways contributed to the improvement observed in multi-
organ insulin sensitivity, our data support the mechanistic links
between whole-body metabolic function and adipose tissue
cholesterol transport, ECM formation, and oxidative stress iden-
tified in animal models.
People with obesity and metabolic abnormalities often have
concomitant systemic and adipose tissue ‘‘inflammation,’’ man-
ifested by increased circulating inflammatory proteins and white
blood cells, and increased subcutaneous adipose tissue macro-
phages, pro-inflammatory CD4+ T-lymphocytes, and increased
gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines
(Fabbrini et al., 2013; Weisberg et al., 2003). Although a mecha-
nistic relationship between inflammation and metabolic dysfunc-
tion has been demonstrated in rodent models (Berg and Scherer,
2005; Brestoff and Artis, 2015; Ferrante, 2007; Hotamisligil,
2006; Hotamisligil et al., 1995; Sun et al., 2013), the importance
of low-grade inflammation in the pathogenesis of obesity-related
insulin resistance in people is not clear, and moderate 5%–6%
weight gain decreases insulin sensitivity in people without

 increasing systemic or subcutaneous adipose tissue markers of
inflammation (Boden et al., 2015; Fabbrini et al., 2015). There-
fore, we sought to evaluate the effect of moderate 5% weight
loss and progressively greater amounts of weight loss on the
relationship between metabolic function and both systemic
and adipose tissue markers of inflammation. Our data demon-
strate that the improvement in multi-organ insulin sensitivity after
5% weight loss was not accompanied by an improvement in
either systemic or subcutaneous adipose tissue markers of
inflammation. However, 11%–16% weight loss was associated
with a reduction in both systemic and subcutaneous adipose
tissue inflammation. This biphasic adipose tissue immune
response to weight loss observed in our subjects is consistent
with the early increase and subsequent decrease in adipose tis-
sue macrophage content observed after calorie restriction and
weight loss in obese mice (Kosteli et al., 2010). In fact, it is
possible that a moderate increase in adipose tissue inflammation
during early weight loss provides a beneficial adaptive response
to energy restriction, because adipose tissue inflammation could
be required for appropriate adipose tissue remodeling (Rutkow-
ski et al., 2015; Wernstedt Asterholm et al., 2014). Together,
these findings suggest that the beneficial effect of 5% weight
loss on insulin action is not mediated by a reduction in subcu-
taneous adipose tissue inflammation. However, we did not eval-
uate potential alterations in inflammation in other adipose tissue
depots, such as intra-abdominal fat, or evaluate the potential
paracrine effects of adipose tissue cytokines that would not be
detected by our study methods. Moreover, we cannot exclude
the possibility that decreased adipose tissue inflammation con-
tributes to the improvement in insulin sensitivity observed with
greater weight loss, e.g., after bariatric surgery-induced 20%
weight loss that has been associated with decreased gene
expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and macrophage
number in adipose tissue of people with obesity (Bradley et al.,
2012; Cancello et al., 2005; Moschen et al., 2010).
Perspective
Although 5%–10% weight loss is a commonly recommended
therapeutic target for people with obesity (Jensen et al., 2014),
the differences between 5% and 10% weight loss and the effects
of additional diet-induced weight loss on body composition,
adipose tissue biology, and cardiometabolic health outcomes
are not clear. Therefore, we conducted a randomized controlled
trial to determine: (1) the effects of 5% weight loss on metabolic
function and both systemic and subcutaneous adipose tissue
markers of inflammation; and (2) the effects of subsequent pro-
gressive weight loss on body composition, metabolic function,
and global adipose tissue gene expression profile. The major
findings from our study demonstrate that 5% weight loss
improves multi-organ (adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle)
insulin sensitivity, b cell function, and multiple risk factors for
cardiometabolic disease. These therapeutic effects occurred
without a concomitant change in systemic or subcutaneous
adipose tissue markers of inflammation, demonstrating that
improvement of these selected markers of inflammation is not
necessary for weight loss-induced improvements in metabolic
function. Progressive 11% and16% weight loss caused stepwise
reductions in body fat mass, IAAT volume and IHTG content, pro-
gressive changes in adipose tissue biology (i.e., upregulation of
metabolic pathways and genes involved in cholesterol flux and
downregulation of metabolic pathways and genes involved in
lipid synthesis, ECM remodeling and oxidative stress), further
improvement in skeletal muscle, but not liver or adipose tissue,
insulin sensitivity, and continued improvement in b cell function.
The results from the present study demonstrate the profound
therapeutic effects of weight loss on metabolic function and
other risk factors for cardiometabolic disease in people with
obesity. Even a moderate 5% weight loss has considerable
health benefits, including decreased IAAT volume, IHTG content,
systolic blood pressure and plasma triglyceride concentration,
and increased multi-organ insulin sensitivity and b cell function.
Additional weight loss further improves many cardiometabolic
outcomes and has a progressive effect on adipose tissue
expression of genes involved in cholesterol flux, lipid synthesis,
ECM remodeling, and oxidative stress. Future studies are
needed to determine whether the weight loss-induced changes
in adipose tissue biology contribute to the observed beneficial
effects on cardiometabolic outcomes.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Study Subjects
40 sedentary (<2 hr of exercise/week) men and women (44 ± 12 years old) who
were obese (BMI = 37.9 ± 4.3 kg/m2) participated in this study (ClinicalTrials.
gov, NCT01299519). All subjects completed a screening history and physical
examination, a resting electrocardiogram, and standard blood tests. Subjects
with obesity had evidence of multi-organ insulin resistance (based on a
homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance score >2.0 [Levy et al.,
1998] and results of a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure con-
ducted in conjunction with infusion of stable isotopically labeled tracers) and
an increase in both systemic and adipose tissue markers of inflammation
(compared with a group of lean adults that we studied previously) (Yoshino
et al., 2012) (Table S1 and Figure S3). No subject had evidence of serious
illness or organ dysfunction (e.g., diabetes), were taking medications that
could interfere with insulin action, consumed excessive alcohol (>14 drinks/
week for women and >21 drinks/week for men) or smoked tobacco products.
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Washington
University School of Medicine in St. Louis, MO, and written informed consent
was obtained from all subjects before their participation.
Study Design
Subjects were randomly assigned to weight loss (n = 20) or weight maintenance
(n = 20) therapy. Subjects in both groups participated in a lifestyle intervention
The main effect of time was evaluated with repeated-measures ANOVA, which revealed significant linear changes for all genes. Not normally distributed variables
were log transformed for analysis and back transformed for presentation. Data are means ± SEM. *p < 0.05 versus baseline; yp < 0.05 for linear component and
zp < 0.05 for quadratic component.

 programthatincludedweeklyindividualbehavioreducationsessionsanddietary
counseling. Initial dietary recommendations were based on an estimate of each
subject’s total daily energy expenditure (1.53 measured resting energy expendi-
ture,assessedbyusinganautomatedmetabolicmeasurementsystem[TrueOne
2400, ParvoMedics]) to help ensure subjects in the weight maintenance group
maintained the same body weight for 6 months and that subjects in the weight
loss group achieved their weight loss targets. All subjects were able to achieve
a 5% weight loss by consuming a low-calorie diet of self-prepared foods. Solid
and liquid meal replacements were provided to participants, as needed, to
achieve the 10% (11% actual weight loss) and 15% (16% actual weight loss)
weight loss targets. The precise intervention was individualized based on the
judgment of the study dietitian and behavioral psychologist after discussion
withtheparticipant.More details aboutthe lifestyleinterventionprogramare pro-
vided in the Supplemental Information. All 20 subjects in the weight loss group
were required to lose 5% of their weight; half (n = 10) were assigned to continue
tolose �10% and then �15%of their initial body weight. After subjects achieved
each weight loss target, a weight maintenance diet was prescribed to maintain a
stable body weight (<2% change) for at least 3 weeks before repeat testing was
performed. Subjects were studied at baseline and after 6 months in the weight
maintenance group and after targeted weight loss in the weight loss group.
Body Composition
Body fat mass and FFM were determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiome-
try, IAAT volume by MRI, and IHTG content by magnetic resonance spectros-
copy (Fabbrini et al., 2015).
24 hr Ambulatory Blood Pressure and Heart Rate
Subjects were fitted with a portable blood pressure recording device (Ultralite
90217 monitor, Spacelabs Healthcare) to monitor 24 hr ambulatory blood
pressure and heart rate (every 20 min from 0600 hr to 2400 hr, and every
hour from 2400 hr to 0600 hr).
Oral Glucose Tolerance Test
After subjects fasted for 12 hr overnight, they were admitted to the Clinical
Research Unit at 0700 hr. An intravenous catheter was placed into a hand
vein, which was heated to 55�C by using a thermostatically controlled box, to
obtain arterialized venous blood samples. After three blood samples were ob-
tained at 5 min intervals, subjects ingested a 75 g glucose drink, and additional
blood samples were collected at 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after glucose
ingestion to determine plasma glucose, insulin, and C-peptide concentrations.
Hyperinsulinemic-Euglycemic Clamp Procedure and Adipose Tissue
Biopsies
Subjects were admitted to the Clinical Research Unit in the afternoon
and consumed a standard evening meal. After subjects fasted for 12 hr over-
night, a 10.5 hr, two-stage hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure in
conjunction with stable isotopically labeled tracer infusions and subcutaneous
abdominal adipose tissue biopsies from the periumbilical area were performed
as previously described (Fabbrini et al., 2015).
Sample Analyses and Calculations
Real-Time PCR
Total RNA was isolated from frozen subcutaneous adipose tissue samples by
using QIAzol and RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN). Gene expression was determined
by using an ABI 7500 real-time PCR system (Invitrogen) and SYBR Green Mas-
ter Mix (Invitrogen) as previously described (Fabbrini et al., 2015; Yoshino
et al., 2014). The expression of each gene was determined by normalizing
the cycle threshold value of each sample to the housekeeping control gene,
ribosomal protein (36B4). Primer details are listed in Table S3.
Microarray
Microarray analyses were performed with the GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST
array (Affymetrix). To identify biological pathways that were significantly
altered by weight loss, normalized data were subjected to PAGE as previously
described (Fabbrini et al., 2015; Pearson et al., 2008; Yoshino et al., 2011). Ca-
nonical pathway and GO gene sets used in PAGE were obtained from http://
www.broad.mit.edu/gsea/msigdb/msigdb_index.html (C2: curated gene sets
collection and C5: GO gene sets collection). Z scores and p values were calcu-
lated for each gene set.
Other sample analyses and calculations used to evaluate metabolic function
are available in the Supplemental Information.
Statistical Analyses
Multi-organ insulin sensitivity and intrahepatic triglyceride content were the
primary outcomes of our study; other components of body composition and
other metabolic variables were secondary outcomes; and adipose tissue
gene expression was an exploratory outcome. The effect of weight loss
and differences between groups were evaluated by using repeated-mea-
sures ANOVA for normally distributed variables or Friedman’s test for not
normally distributed variables. Significant time-by-group interactions in
the statistical analysis of the effect of 5% weight loss, and significant
main effects of time in the statistical analysis of the effect of progressive
weight loss, were followed by appropriate between- and within-group
post hoc tests to adjust for multiple comparisons. Results are shown
as means ± SD for normally distributed variables or medians (quartile 1,
quartile 3) for not normally distributed variables, unless otherwise indi-
cated. Based on the intra-individual variability of insulin sensitivity we
have observed previously (Magkos et al., 2011), we estimated that 8 sub-
jects per group would be needed to detect between-group differences
of R19% in hepatic, R25% in adipose tissue, and R29% in skeletal mus-
cle insulin sensitivity, with a power of 0.8 and an a value of 0.05. Therefore,
we estimated that 15–20 subjects would need to be recruited in each group
to ensure that an adequate number of subjects completed the study. Fewer
subjects would be needed to detect differences of similar magnitude within
the same group (Magkos et al., 2011).
