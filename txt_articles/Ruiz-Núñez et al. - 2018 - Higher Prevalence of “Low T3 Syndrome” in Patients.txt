Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a heterogeneous disease with unknown cause(s). CFS 
symptoms resemble a hypothyroid state, possibly secondary to chronic (low-grade) (met-
abolic) inflammation. We studied 98 CFS patients (21–69 years, 21 males) and 99 age- 
and sex-matched controls (19–65 years, 23 males). We measured parameters of thyroid 
function, (metabolic) inflammation, gut wall integrity and nutrients influencing thyroid func-
tion and/or inflammation. Most remarkably, CFS patients exhibited similar thyrotropin, but 
lower free triiodothyronine (FT3) (difference of medians 0.1%), total thyroxine (TT4) (11.9%), 
total triiodothyronine (TT3) (12.5%), %TT3 (4.7%), sum activity of deiodinases (14.4%), 
secretory capacity of the thyroid gland (14.9%), 24-h urinary iodine (27.6%), and higher 
% reverse T3 (rT3) (13.3%). FT3 below the reference range, consistent with the “low T3 
syndrome,” was found in 16/98 CFS patients vs. 7/99 controls (OR 2.56; 95% confidence 
interval = 1.00–6.54). Most observations persisted in two sensitivity analyses with more 
stringent cutoff values for body mass index, high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and 
WBC. We found possible evidence of (chronic) low-grade metabolic inflammation (ferritin 
and HDL-C). FT3, TT3, TT4, and rT3 correlated positively with hsCRP in CFS patients and 
all subjects. TT3 and TT4 were positively related to hsCRP in controls. Low circulating 
T3 and the apparent shift from T3 to rT3 may reflect more severely depressed tissue T3 
levels. The present findings might be in line with recent metabolomic studies pointing at 
a hypometabolic state. They resemble a mild form of “non-thyroidal illness syndrome” 
and “low T3 syndrome” experienced by a subgroup of hypothyroid patients receiving T4 
monotherapy. Our study needs confirmation and extension by others. If confirmed, trials 
with, e.g., T3 and iodide supplements might be indicated.

“Low T3 Syndrome” in Patients With CFS

inTrODUcTiOn
Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also referred to as myalgic 
encephalomyelitis, is a complex heterogeneous disease, most 
commonly characterized by disabling fatigue, cognitive impair-
ment, disrupted sleep and concomitant skeletal and muscular 
pain, lasting for more than 6 months and not improving with 
rest (1, 2) [for a broader definition, see Ref. (3)]. Impaired 
physical and social functioning, vitality, emotional well-being 
and role limitations due to emotional problems (4) contribute 
to an impaired quality of life (5). Although most patients have 
mild or moderate symptoms, some suffer from severe CFS 
and are housebound or even unable to move from their beds 
(4). The diagnosis of CFS is based on the Fukuda criteria, i.e., 
symptoms, disability, and exclusion of explanatory illnesses, 
and not by means of physical signs or abnormalities in labo-
ratory test results (1–3). About 75% or more are female. The 
mean age of onset is 29–35 years and the mean illness duration 
ranges from 3 to 9 years (6), which implies that the symptoms 
are reversible. A meta-analysis of clinically confirmed cases in 
several countries indicates a prevalence of 0.76% (7). In 2005, 
the prevalence of CFS in The Netherlands was slightly lower, 
0.18–0.25% (30,000–40,000 patients among 16 million inhabit-
ants) (8).
The underlying cause of CFS remains unclear. Many patho-
physiological cascades have been hypothesized but underlying 
organic conditions are rarely found. Disturbed hypothalamus–
pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, presented as mild hypocortisolism, 
heightened negative feedback and blunted responses to challenge 
have been found in CFS (9). Computational analysis using endo-
crine and gene expression data suggest that CFS is associated 
with immune-mediated loss of thyroid function, exacerbated 
by a blunted HPA axis response (10). Autonomic dysfunction, 
including orthostatic intolerance and syncope, microglial activa-
tion and structural changes, indicate involvement of the brain 
(11). There is accumulating evidence that the cardiovascular 
system is compromised, with reports of autonomic dysfunction, 
attenuated heart rate and blood pressure (12) and increased 
death rate from heart failure (13). The latter finding was related 
to a blunted cortisol response (14). Taken together, dysfunctional 
central housekeeping involving interactions between both the 
HPA and hypothalamus–pituitary–thyroid (HPT) axes and the 
sympathetic/adrenal medulla, rather than single-hormone-axis 
disturbances, might play a key role in the development of CFS 
symptoms (10, 11, 14).
Dysregulation of the immune system in CFS may include 
autoimmune reactions and low-grade inflammation. Some 
studies demonstrated autoantibodies directed at diverse nuclear 
and neuronal components (15, 16) and against some neuro-
transmitters and neurotransmitter receptors in the CNS (17, 18). 
 
Others associated infection and vaccination with later CFS 
onset (19, 20). Recently, pandemic influenza A (H1N1) infec-
tion was related with a more than two-fold increased CFS risk 
(21). A state of low-grade inflammation (22), as derived from 
elevated (hs)CRP (23), interleukin (IL)-6 (24), IL-1 and tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF)-α (22), and/or nuclear factor kappa B 
(NFκB) (25) has, however, not consistently been found (26–28), 
possibly because of differences in experimental approaches and 
patient conditions (28). Increased translocation of lipopolysac-
charides (LPS) from Gram-negative enterobacteria with subse-
quent gut-derived inflammation was also found (29). Giloteaux 
et al. demonstrated intestinal dysbiosis resulting from a more 
proinflammatory gut microbiome that may trigger the immune 
system (30). Recently, the relationship between the thyroid 
with gut microbiome and inflammation became apparent from 
the associations of both hypothyroidism and levothyroxine use 
with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (31).
Several symptoms resemble those of hypothyroidism. They 
are, however, not accompanied by the marked thyrotropin 
(TSH) increases of full-blown hypothyroidism (32). Fuite et al. 
(10) suggested immune-mediated loss of thyroid function in 
CFS patients. Low-grade inflammation and subclinical hypo-
thyroidism are not mutually exclusive. Inflammation virtually 
affects all hormonal axes (33), including the HPT axis (34). 
Profound changes in this axis occur in the “non-thyroidal 
illness syndrome (NTIS),” also referred to as “euthyroid sick 
syndrome,” which has notably been investigated in critically ill 
patients (35). As part of the acute phase response, this condition 
may reflect an adaptation to counteract excessive catabolism 
during severe illness (34). The most important clinical chemi-
cal features of mild to moderate NTIS are normal/low-normal 
TSH, low total triiodothyronine (TT3) and free T3 (FT3) 
levels, normal/high-normal total thyroxine (TT4), decreased 
peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, and increased reverse T3 
(rT3) levels (36). Chronic inflammation in rodents increases 
the expression of deiodinase 3 (D3), which inactivates both 
T3 and T4 with concomitant production of 3,3′-diiodothyro-
nine (T2) and rT3, respectively (34). A recent study (37) also 
reported elevated concentrations of 3,5-T2 in humans affected 
by cardiac NTIS.
Chronic fatigue syndrome has been described as an “allostatic 
overload condition” (38), where the physiological mechanisms 
employed to deal with stress (also named “allostatic states”) 
contribute to the perpetuation of the disorder. CFS patients 
are 1.9 times more likely to have a high allostatic load index 
than healthy controls (39) and this allostatic load also correlates 
positively with CFS symptoms (40). Thyroid allostasis-adaptive 
responses, presenting as NTIS, have been found in many 
conditions, ranging from critical illness, uremia and starvation 
to tumors (41). Taken together, it is possible that, despite TSH 
and T4 levels within reference ranges, CFS symptoms may be 
attributable in part to allostatic responses, i.e., lower thyroid 
hormone activity, secondary to chronic (low-grade) inflamma-
tion caused by, e.g., a compromised gut microbiome and gut 
wall integrity.
In the present case–control study, we focused on signs of 
low-grade inflammation and subclinical hypothyroidism. We 
measured parameters of thyroid function, low-grade inflamma-
tion and gut wall integrity (42), together with secondary markers 
of inflammation, also named metabolic inflammation (43, 44), 
including insulin resistance-mediated de novo lipogenesis (DNL), 
HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), and the status of nutrients influenc-
ing thyroid function (iodine and selenium) and inflammation 
[fish oil fatty acids (FA) and vitamin D].

study Design and study group
Patients were recruited in the Parkstad Clinic in Amsterdam, 
The Netherlands. They were diagnosed with CFS according to 
the CBO guideline (45). These are based on the Fukuda criteria 
(1), with the exclusion criteria of Reeves (3). In the Parkstad 
Clinic, 250 CFS patients are seen on a regular basis. From these, 
150 were randomly selected to receive a letter requesting their 
voluntary participation. A total of 109 agreed to participate. Three 
of the participants were not patients of the Parkstad Clinic, mak-
ing a total of 112 (see Figure 1 for flow scheme). The patients

completed a questionnaire on their health, recent non-chronic 
medication use, smoking habits, supplement use, and pregnancy 
and lactation. Exclusion criteria were use of medication that may 
affect thyroid function (e.g., T4, antiarrhythmic drugs, such as 
amiodarone or corticosteroids), pregnancy, breastfeeding, and 
menstruation during urine collection. Other exclusion criteria 
were (biochemical) abnormalities that are excluded according to 
the CBO guideline and not demonstrated at the time of diagnosis, 
e.g., severe obesity [body mass index (BMI) > 35 kg/m2], infec-
tion [high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) > 10 mg/L and 
white blood cells (WBC) > 10 × 109/L], anemia [hemoglobin 
(Hb) < 7.0 mmol/L in women and < 8.0 mmol/L in men], 
hyperthyroidism [TSH below reference range with FT3 and/or 
free thyroxine (FT4) above reference range (46)], thyroid hor-
mone resistance [elevated FT4 with non-suppressed TSH (47)], 
hypothyroidism (TSH above upper limit of reference range with 
FT4 below reference range), and subclinical hypothyroidism 
[TSH above reference range with normal FT4 (46)]. Weights and 
lengths were measured on the spot. Data on age were obtained 
from interviews in the Dutch language.
A total of 119 age- and sex-matched apparently healthy con-
trols were recruited by advertisement in the city of Groningen, 
The Netherlands. Health was self-reported with the aid of a health 
checklist filled out before inclusion. Primary exclusion criteria 
were the use of any chronic medication, menstruation during urine 
collection, severe obesity (BMI > 35 kg/m2), and both pregnancy 
and breastfeeding. Incidental use of analgesics and short-term 
medication (e.g., antibiotics, more than 4 weeks ago) were allowed. 
Secondary exclusion criteria were infection (hsCRP > 10 mg/L 
and WBC > 10 × 109/L), anemia (Hb < 7.0 mmol/L in women and 
< 8.0 mmol/L in men), hyperthyroidism [TSH below reference 
range with FT3 and/or FT4 above reference range (46)], thyroid 
hormone resistance [elevated FT4 with non-suppressed TSH 
(47)], hypothyroidism (TSH above upper limit of reference range 
with FT4 below reference range), and subclinical hypothyroidism 
[TSH above reference range with normal FT4 (46)]. Data on age 
were obtained from interviews in the Dutch language. Weight 
and height were self-reported.
All patients and controls received a verbal and written expla-
nation of the objectives and procedures and all provided us with 
written informed consent. The study was in agreement with 
the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human 
experimentation (institutional and national) and with the 
Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008. The protocol was 
approved by the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) 
Medical Ethical Committee (NL44299.042.13, METc 2013/154, 
dated August 12, 2013).
sample size and Final study groups
The calculation of the sample size (i.e., 100 subjects per group) 
was based on the correlation coefficient of a comparable popula-
tion using different steps [for more information, see Ref. (48)]. 
For this, we used the correlation coefficient found by Girvent 
et al. (49) for the association of both inflammatory markers 
CRP and IL-6 with rT3, choosing the highest (i.e., r = 0.75 for 
rT3 vs. CRP). In this study, subjects with NTIS were compared 
with patients without euthyroid sick syndrome, both undergoing 
surgery. Assuming a 95% confidence interval (CI) of (0.59, 0.79), 
we estimated the sample size using IBM SPSS Statistics (ver-
sion 20), with the obtained formula, where the n (sample size) 
appeared inside the Euler number exponent (e). We anticipated 
20% exclusion based on abnormal laboratory data, and therefore 
aimed at the initial inclusion of 120 patients and controls.
We gathered information about supplement intake (vitamin D 
and fish oil) from 71/98 CFS patients. Users were defined as sup-
plementing themselves either with multivitamins and/or other 
supplements containing that specific nutrient.
Subsequently, we performed a sensitivity analysis applying 
stricter exclusion criteria for possible signs of (low-grade) inflam-
mation (“selected groups 1 and 2,” see Results and Figure 1). In 
the first sensitivity analysis, both CFS patients and controls with 
BMI > 30 kg/m2 and/or hsCRP > 5 mg/L were excluded. In the 
second one, we also excluded subjects with hsCRP > 3 mg/L and/
or with WBC > 10 × 109/L.
sample collection and analyses
Approximately 50 mL of blood were collected by venipuncture in 
the non-fasting state in three types of tubes (EDTA anticoagulated, 
lithium–heparin anticoagulated, and serum separator). Samples 
were processed within 2 h after collection. Twenty-four-hour urine 
samples were collected and their volumes measured. Samples 
were stored at −20°C and sent to the participating laboratories 
[UMCG, laboratory of Special Chemistry and Radiochemistry, 
Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam (AMC), Medical 
Laboratories, Reinier de Graaf Groep Diagnostisch Centrum, 
Delft, and European Laboratory of Nutrients (ELN), Bunnik].
EDTA-whole blood was used for the measurement of 
routine hematological parameters [Hb, hematocrit, WBC, red 
blood cells (RBC), and thrombocytes] with a Sysmex XN-9000 
Hematology Analyzer (Sysmex Nederland BV, Etten Leur, The 
Netherlands). The remainder of the EDTA blood was separated 
into thrombocyte-rich plasma and an RBC pellet by centrifuga-
tion for 10 min at 1,800 g. RBC were washed three times with 
0.9% NaCl and resuspended to an about 50% hematocrit. After 
washing, 200 µl of the RBC suspension was transferred to a tef-
lon-sealable “Sovirel” tube containing 2 mL of methanol-6 mol/L 
HCl (5:1 v/v), 1 mg butylated hydroxytoluene (antioxidant), and 
50 µg 17:0 (internal standard). In this ready-to-transmethylate 
mixture, FAs are stable at room temperature and in the dark 
for months (50). After centrifugation (10 min, 1,800 g) of the 
thrombocyte-rich EDTA-plasma, we aliquoted the isolated 
thrombocyte-poor EDTA plasma and stored it in 2 mL cryovials 
at −20°C. Lithium–heparin whole blood (1.5 mL) was aliquoted 
for measurement of elements. The remainders of the lithium–
heparin anticoagulated blood and the coagulated blood sample 
were centrifuged for 10 min at 1,800 g. The resulting plasma and 
serum were isolated, transferred to 2 mL cryovials, and stored at 
−20°C until analysis.
Red blood cell–FA compositions were determined by capillary 
gas chromatography/flame ionization detection in the UMCG, 
using previously described procedures (50). RBC-FA contents 
were expressed in g/100 g FA (g%). Tryptophan and kynurenine 
were measured in EDTA-plasma by LC–electrospray ioniza-
tion–MS/MS as previously described (51). Serum 25(OH)D2

and 25(OH)D3 [together referred to as 25(OH)D] were deter-
mined by isotope dilution-online solid-phase extraction liquid 
chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (ID-XLC-MS/MS) 
in the UMCG (52). Plasma MMA was measured by LC-MS/MS 
according to Nelson et al. (53). Serum iron, ferritin, hsCRP, total 
cholesterol (TC), and LDL- and HDL-C were measured using a 
Roche Modular P module (Roche, Almere, The Netherlands). 
Vitamin B12, folate, TSH, FT4, and FT3 were assayed by elec-
trochemiluminescent immunoassay on the Roche Modular E170 
Analyzer. Serum TT4 and TT3 were measured using an Architect 
i2000SR (Abbott Diagnostics, Hoofddorp, The Netherlands). 
Serum antithyroglobulin antibodies and antithyroid peroxidase 
antibodies were measured with an Immulite 2000 (Siemens, The 
Netherlands). Plasma rT3 was measured by in-house RIA (54) at 
the AMC, The Netherlands. Plasma homocysteine was analyzed 
in the UMCG by competitive protein binding assays with the 
use of an immunochemistry analyzer (IMX; Abbott Diagnostics, 
Hoofddorp, The Netherlands).
Whole blood- and lithium–heparin plasma selenium, copper, 
magnesium and zinc and iodine in urine were measured using 
ICP-MS 7700x (Agilent, Amstelveen, The Netherlands) in the 
ELN. Selenium, copper, magnesium and zinc contents in RBC 
were calculated from their concentrations in plasma and whole 
blood, using hematocrit values for correction. Plasma zonulin 
(active form) concentrations were measured using the K5600 
ELISA kit (Immundiagnostik AG, Bensheim, Germany). The 
quantification of 8-iso-prostaglandin F2-isoprostanes in urine 
was performed by GC-tandem-MS using a two-step derivatiza-
tion and a selective solid-phase extraction protocol with HLB and 
Silica columns as described by Zhao et al. (55). The tryptophan/
kynurenine ratio was calculated. This ratio may be decreased 
during inflammation (56, 57).
For the investigation of the pathogenesis of the “low-T3 
syndrome,” we measured FT3/FT4, TT3/TT4 and rT3/TT3 
ratios. For the investigation of the underlying etiology of the 
“low-T3 syndrome,” we calculated the following variables of 
thyroid metabolism: standard TSH index (sTSHi), in order to 
quantify the thyrotropic function of the pituitary (58); the sum 
activity of deiodinases [structure parameter inference approach 
(SPINA)-GD] as a variable for deiodination function (59); the 
secretory capacity of the thyroid gland (SPINA-GT), as an evalu-
ation of thyroid secretory status (59); and the ratios of TT3/FT3 
and TT4/FT4 as evaluations of protein binding of thyroid hor-
mones. The sTSHi was calculated as TSHi = (TSH − 2.70)/0.676 
(58). SPINA-GD and -GT were calculated as SPINA-GD = [β31 ×  
(KM1 + FT4) × TT3]/(α31 × FT4) and SPINA-GT = [βT × (DT + 
TSH) × TT4]/(αT × TSH). Constants in the equations were as 
follows: β31 = 8 × 10–6/s, KM1 = 5 × 10–7 mol/L, α31 = 0.026/L, 
βT = 1.1 × 10−6/s, DT = 2.75 mU/L, and αT = 0.1/L (59, 60). The 
rT3/TT3 ratio was also calculated as a proxy for a metabolic shift. 
For the latter, we also calculated the %TT4, %TT3, and %rT3 by 
dividing their concentrations by the sum of TT4 + TT3 + rT3 
and adjusting to 100%. Zinc/copper, TC/HDL-C and eicosa-
pentaenoic acid (EPA)/arachidonic acid (AA) ratios were also 
calculated. A proxy for hepatic DNL (DNL liver) was calculated 
according to Kuipers et al. (61) (sum of RBC 16:0, 16:1ω7, 18:1ω7, 
20:1ω7, 18:1ω9, 20:1ω9, and 22:1ω9). The omega-3 index, RBC-
EPA + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (RBC-EPA + DHA) was 
calculated.
statistics
Statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics 
23 SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA. Mann–Whitney U-tests were 
used for the evaluation of between-group differences in the 
distribution. The Chi-square tests were used for the evalua-
tion of between-group differences in nominal variables. Odds 
ratios were calculated to quantify the strength of the pres-
ence of low T3 in the different groups. Correlation analyses 
were performed using Spearman’s Rho for non-parametric 
variables.
resUlTs
Of the 112 initially included CFS patients, six taking oral thyroid 
hormone and one with BMI > 35 kg/m2 were excluded, leaving 
105 patients. Of these, one subject with thyroid hormone resist-
ance [defined as elevated serum levels of FT4 with non-suppressed 
TSH (47)], one with hyperthyroidism [TSH below reference 
range with FT3 and/or FT4 above reference range (46)], four with 
subclinical hypothyroidism [TSH above reference range with 
normal FT4 (46)], and one suspected of active infection (both 
hsCRP > 10 mg/L and WBC > 10 × 109/L) were excluded; making 
a total of 98 finally included CFS patients (Figure 1).
Of the 119 age- and sex-matched apparently healthy controls, 
11 taking chronic medication were excluded, leaving 108 con-
trols. Of these, one with hypothyroidism (TSH above reference 
range with FT4 below reference range), five with subclinical 
hypothyroidism [TSH above reference range with normal FT4 
(46)], one suspected of active infection (both hsCRP > 10 mg/L 
and WBC > 10 × 109/L), and two with anemia were excluded; 
making a total of 99 finally included healthy controls (Figure 1).
Whole study group
Characteristics of the 98 CFS patients and the 99 controls are 
shown in Table 1. The CFS patients (21 males, 77 females) had a 
median age of 43 years (range 21–69), median height of 172 cm 
(149–198), median weight of 68 kg (48–118), and median BMI of 
22 kg/m2 (18–34). The age- and-sex-matched healthy controls (23 
males, 76 females) had a median age of 39 years (19–65), median 
height of 173 cm (156–193), median weight of 70 kg (47–100), 
and a median BMI of 23 kg/m2 (18–33). The above anthropomet-
ric characteristics exhibited no between-group differences.
Thyroid Hormones
Chronic fatigue syndrome patients exhibited lower FT3, TT4, 
TT3, %TT3, SPINA-GD, and SPINA-GT, lower ratios of TT3/
TT4, FT3/FT4, TT3/FT3, and TT4/FT4; and higher %rT3 and 
rT3/TT3 ratio. There were no between-group differences in other 
thyroid hormone parameters, notably TSH, FT4, rT3, and %TT4 
(Table 1). FT3 below the reference range was more frequently 
found in CFS patients (16/98) as compared to controls (7/99; 
p = 0.035) with an odds ratio of 2.56 (95% CI = 1.00–6.54).

(Metabolic) Inflammation
We did not find significant differences in WBC, hsCRP, trypto-
phan/kynurenine ratio and urinary isoprostanes. CFS patients 
displayed lower kynurenine and tryptophan, as compared to the 
healthy controls. Taking both genders together, we found that fer-
ritin was higher in CFS patients as compared to controls. Analyzed 
according to gender, we found that ferritin was higher in both 
male and female CFS patients, as compared to their apparently 
healthy counterparts (females: 77 CFS vs. 76 controls; p = 0.003; 
males 21 CFS patients vs. 23 controls; p = 0.012) (data not shown 
in Table 1). Taking both genders together, we found that HDL-C 
was lower and the TC/HDL-C ratio higher in CFS patients as 
compared to controls. Analyzed according to gender, we found 
that HDL-C was lower in both male and female CFS patients, 
as compared to their apparently healthy counterparts (females: 
77 CFS vs. 76 controls; p < 0.001; males 21 CFS patients vs. 23 
controls; p = 0.04). The TC/HDL-C ratio was higher in female 
CFS patients compared to controls (p = 0.001) data not shown in 
Table 1. The RBC-FA composition showed a lower hepatic DNL 
in CFS patients.
Zonulin, a parameter of intestinal permeability (42), was lower 
in CFS patients as compared to controls.
Nutritional Factors Influencing Thyroid Function and 
Inflammation
The 24-h urinary iodine output, as a proxy of iodine status, was 
lower in CFS patients. Plasma selenium was similar, but intracel-
lular selenium was higher (Table 1).
Vitamin D [25(OH)D] status of CFS patients was higher. 
Never 
theless, 58 patients (59%) and 82 (83%) controls presented 
25(OH)D levels below the optimal cutoff of 80 nmol/L. None of 
the patients and 2% of the controls exhibited RBC-EPA + DHA 
contents above 8 g%, which is considered to confer optimal 
protection against cardiovascular (62) and neuropsychiatric (63) 
diseases. CFS patients and controls exhibited no differences in 
RBC-EPA/AA ratio, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular 
disease (64) and inflammation-induced depression (65). We 
gathered information about supplement intake from 71/98 CFS 
patients. Among these, the users did not exhibit higher status of 
vitamin D [plasma 25(OH)D; 30 vs. 41; p = 0.48] or EPA + DHA 
(RBC-EPA + DHA; 7 vs. 64; p = 0.44).
Additional laboratory data, including hematological indices, 
nutrient status influencing anemia, and other RBC-FA can be 
found in Table S1 in Supplementary Material.
Interim Conclusions Based on the Whole Group
Figure 2 shows the case–control between-group differences 
in terms of percentages lower or higher of the medians of CFS 
patients compared to those of controls. Only significant between-
group differences are depicted. Most remarkably, the results for 
the whole group indicated similar TSH in patients with CFS, 
but subtle changes in thyroid hormone concentrations, with an 
apparent shift in their metabolism. CFS patients notably exhibited 
relatively lower FT3, TT4, and TT3; lower deiodination function 
(SPINA-GD), lower thyroid secretory function (SPINA-GT), 
lower protein binding of thyroid hormones (TT3/FT3, TT4/
FT4), and lower T3/T4 hormone ratios (TT3/TT4, FT3/FT4), 
lower %TT3, higher %rT3, and higher rT3/TT3 ratio. The lower 
24-h urine iodine output of CFS patients was also remarkable.
sensitivity analyses
The strength of the above findings for the whole group was tested 
with “sensitivity analyses.” For this goal, we created “selected 
subgroups 1 and 2” by exclusion of subjects with the most promi-
nent signs of (metabolic) inflammation, defined as relatively high 
hsCRP and BMI.
Selected Subgroups 1
Of the 98 CFS patients, seven with hsCRP > 5 mg/L (of whom 
three had BMI > 30 kg/m2) and six others with a BMI > 30 kg/m2  
were excluded to create a subgroup of 85 patients (selected CFS 
subgroup 1) (Figure 1). Of the 99 healthy controls, four with 
hsCRP > 5 mg/L and four others with a BMI > 30 kg/m2 were 
excluded to create a subgroup of 91 controls (selected control 
subgroup 1) (Figure 1). All parameters of thyroid function and 
inflammation that were significantly different between CFS 
patients and controls in the whole group, remained significant 
after this sensitivity analysis.
Selected Subgroups 2
Of the 85 CFS patients in selected subgroup 1, five with 
hsCRP > 3 mg/L and three with WBC > 10 × 109/L (as more 
sensitive markers of inflammation) were excluded to create a 
subgroup of 77 patients (selected CFS subgroup 2) (Figure 1). 
Of the 91 controls in selected subgroup 1, 7 subjects with 
hsCRP > 3 mg/L and 2 with WBC > 10 × 109/L were excluded 
to create a subgroup of 82 controls (selected control subgroup 2) 
 
(Figure 1). Characteristics of these CFS patients and controls, 
together with their clinical chemical data are shown in Table S2 in 
Supplementary Material. FT3 below the reference range was more 
frequently found in CFS patients (16/77) as compared to controls 
(7/82; p = 0.024) with an odds ratio of 2.81 (95% CI = 1.09–7.27), 
although the FT3 was no longer significantly lower. The higher 
ferritin proved no longer significantly different (compared to 
sensitivity analysis 1). However, ferritin remained higher in male 
and female CFS patients as compared to their apparently healthy 
counterparts (females: 59 CFS vs. 60 controls; p = 0.015; males 18 
CFS patients vs. 22 controls; p = 0.026) (data not shown in Table 
S2 in Supplementary Material). Analyzed according to gender, 
we found that HDL-C remained lower and the TC/HDL-C ratio 
remained higher in female CFS patients as compared to the healthy 
controls (females: 59 CFS vs. 60 controls; p = 0.010 and p = 0.007) 
(data not shown in Table S2 in Supplementary Material).
Conclusions Based on the Sensitivity Analyses
Most importantly, we found that most of the subtle between-
group thyroid hormone differences persisted when CFS patients 
and controls with more signs of (metabolic) low-grade inflamma-
tion were excluded, except for the occurrence of lower FT3 in CFS 
patients. However, FT3 below the reference range remained more 
frequent in CFS patients after applying stricter exclusion criteria.
Correlation Analysis
We found that FT3, TT3, TT4 and rT3 were positively related to 
hsCRP in the CFS patients (n = 98) and the combined controls

and CFS patients (n = 197) (Figure S1 in Supplementary Material). 
TT3 and TT4 were also positively related to hsCRP in the controls 
(n = 99) (Table S3 in Supplementary Material). TSH and FT4 
did not correlate with hsCRP. When combined, controls and CFS 
patients with low FT3 (<4.4 pmol/L) were also found to more 
often exhibit low hsCRP (<1 mg/L) in the whole group (p = 0.001) 
(n = 197; OR 6.22; 95% CI = 1.78–21.70) and in selected group 2 
(p = 0.011) (n = 159; OR 4.26; 95% CI = 1.20–15.03).
DiscUssiOn
The most remarkable observation in this case–control study was 
that, as a group, the present CFS patients exhibited lower FT3, 
TT4, TT3, %TT3, SPINA-GD, SPINA-GT, T3/T4 ratios, lower 
protein binding of thyroid hormones, and 24-h urinary iodine 
excretion, together with higher %rT3. Sixteen (16%) CFS patients 
exhibited the “low T3 syndrome” as compared to seven (7%) con-
trols (Table 1). These observations were basically unaltered upon 
applying more stringent cutoff values for hCRP, BMI and WBC in 
our “sensitivity analyses” (Table S2 in Supplementary Material). 
CFS patients also showed some signs of (metabolic) low-grade 
inflammation, notably higher TC/HDL-C and ferritin, and lower 
HDL-C, tryptophan and kynurenine. When the TC/HDL-C ratio, 
HDL-C, and ferritin were evaluated according to gender, we did 
not find differences in the TC/HDL-C ratio in the relatively 
small number of men (n = 21), but those in the females (n = 77) 
persisted. HDL-C was lower and ferritin remained higher in both 
male and female CFS patients compared to controls. Therefore, 
we conclude that, in the present study, we found subtle evidence 
of low-grade (metabolic) inflammation in CFS patients. Plasma 
25(OH)D below the optimal cutoff value of 80 nmol/L was found 
in 59% of the CFS patients and 83% of controls. Both CFS patients 
and controls exhibited low fish intakes, as reflected by their low 
omega-3 index of about 4.1 g%. An omega-3 index of 8 g% is 
considered to confer optimal protection against cardiovascular 
(62) and neuropsychiatric diseases (63).
comparison With nTis
The “low T3 syndrome” encountered in a subgroup of CFS 
patients bears clinical chemical similarity with NTIS features. 
 9
Ruiz-Núñez et al.
“Low T3 Syndrome” in Patients With CFS
Frontiers in Endocrinology | www.frontiersin.org
March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 97
Both syndromes are biochemically characterized by low TT3 
and FT3 together with normal/high-normal FT4 and normal 
TSH, at least in the mild and moderate forms of NTIS (36). The 
clinical disparity relates to the underlying severity of the diseases 
that are usually linked to NTIS, as opposed to the chronicity 
and less life-threatening nature of CFS (66). NTIS is a typical 
feature of critically ill patients in intensive care units, although 
similar changes in the HPT-axis have been observed during 
calorie restriction and in patients with non-critical chronic 
diseases, such as heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, and diabetes mellitus (67), also referred to as mild, or 
atypical forms of NTIS (36, 67). All of these conditions, espe-
cially calorie restriction, might find a common denominator in 
an adaptive response aiming at saving energy and body protein 
in order to outstay any potential acute stress stimulus (68–70). 
Through coordinated changes in thyroid hormone metabolism, 
transport and receptors, NTIS might mechanistically reflect a 
cytokine-orchestrated allostatic condition that is remote from 
the well-known homeostatic negative feedback regulation of the 
HPT axis (71).
low T3 syndrome Might Be in line With 
recent Data of the cFs epigenome and 
Metabolome
A recent study identified 12,608 differentially methylated 
sites in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 49 female 
CFS patients vs. 25 healthy female controls. These sites were 
predominantly involved in metabolism and to a lesser extent 
in neuronal cell development. Among these sites, 1,600 were 
related to a score of self-reported quality of life, while 13 sites 
were associated with glucocorticoid sensitivity in a subgroup 
of CFS patients with glucocorticoid hypersensitivity (72). 
In line with downregulated energy expenditure, recent CFS 
case–control studies of the metabolome revealed abnormalities 
in several metabolic pathways, including those reflecting mito-
chondrial metabolism, consistent with a hypometabolic state 
(73, 74). The lower proxy for DNL encountered in the currently 
studied CFS patients might fit into this picture, since hypo-
thyroidism in mice has been shown to downregulate the rate 
limiting enzymes involved in DNL (75). In addition, induced 
hypothyroidism in humans for two weeks causes profound 
changes in FA metabolism (76). Another recent case–control 
study using metabolic profiling showed an altered serum amino 
acid profile in CFS patients, suggesting impaired mitochondrial 
pyruvate oxidation (74), a condition likely to reflect energy 
deficiency and excessive lactate production, with utilization 
of amino acids from endogenous protein as alternative TCA 
cycle substrate. The “low T3 syndrome” in a subgroup of CFS 
patients found in this study might be cause and consequence 
of the above noted epigenetic changes (72) and a driving 
force of the metabolic differences noted by others (73, 74) 
and by us. Through both genomic and non-genomic actions, T3 
has profound impacts on mitochondria and metabolism (77), 
including several pathways regulating the expression of target 
genes contributing to mitochondrial biogenesis (78).
correlation of Thyroid hormones With 
hscrP
The association between low T3 and low hsCRP suggests that 
both CFS patients and controls with low FT3 are less responsive 
to inflammatory stimuli, which is in line with observations by 
others. In apparently healthy individuals, Hodkinson et al. (79) 
found, amongst others, that TT3 concentrations are positively 
related to monocyte phagocytic activity and expression of -6 (IL-
6) by activated monocytes, while TT4 is positively related to CRP. 
Their data suggest that higher thyroid hormone concentrations 
within the normal range enhance innate and adaptive immunity 
by greater responsiveness to immune stimuli. Accordingly, 
Rozing et al. (80) showed that, although higher circulating levels 
of inflammatory markers were associated with lower levels of 
free serum FT3; higher serum FT3, but not higher TSH and FT4, 
are related to a higher production capacity of proinflammatory 
cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) in whole blood of 85-year-old 
women and men, following ex vivo stimulation with LPS. They 
suggest a mutual association between T3 and proinflammatory 
cytokines, whereas T3 stimulates production of proinflammatory 
cytokines that subsequently diminish the conversion of T4 to 
T3. Finally, evidence of a diminished specific immune response 
has been found in patients with CFS. Investigating pokeweed 
mitogen-stimulated isolated peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells, Loebel et al. (81) found a deficient EBV-specific immune 
response in patients with CFS, possibly causing impaired EBV 
control. Taken together, it is possible that a subgroup of CFS 
patients with low FT3, but also controls with low T3, present a 
diminished responsiveness to immunologic stimuli.
comparison With hypothyroid Patients 
Treated With T4 Monotherapy
Hypothyroidism is, among others, associated with a decrease 
in both metabolic and heart rates, oxygen consumption, body 
temperature and oxidation of glucose, FA, and amino acids. It 
has been estimated that 4–8% of genes are regulated by T3 in 
human skeletal muscle, rodent liver and a pituitary cell line (78). 
The encountered “low T3 syndrome” in our study resembles the 
thyroid hormone profile of a subgroup of hypothyroid patients 
receiving T4 monotherapy. Substitution with T4 is the currently 
recommended treatment of hypothyroid patients, like those with 
Hashimoto thyroiditis. Nevertheless, it is becoming increasingly 
clear that a subgroup of these patients experiences residual 
hypothyroid symptoms, including psychological and metabolic 
traces. These symptoms occur despite reaching a chemical 
euthyroid state, i.e., normal TSH (82, 83). In thyroidectomized 
rats, no single dose of T4 was able to simultaneously restore TSH, 
T4, and T3 in plasma and organs to normal levels (84). In so-
called “euthyroid, yet symptomatic” patients, the basal metabolic 
rate and serum cholesterol, among others, are not fully restored 
and they are also likely to have both low TT3 and FT3. These 
findings of low T3 may be explained by a disrupted TSH-T3 
shunt (41). The question whether they would benefit more from 
a T4 and T3 combination therapy or sustained-release T3 (85) 
is debated and subject of further research (82, 83). Hormone

replacement therapy, notably T3, has also been suggested for severe 
 
NTIS (71, 86, 87).
In the NHANES cohort, 469 out of 9,981 participants with nor-
mal TSH were T4-treated. This subgroup of T4-treated subjects 
exhibited 10–15% higher TT4 and FT4, but 5–10% lower TT3 and 
FT3 and a 15–20% lower T3/T4 ratio, as compared to 469 care-
fully matched healthy controls (88). These apparently moderate 
differences suggest that the extra-thyroidal conversion of T4 to 
T3 during T4 monotherapy might be insufficient in some patients 
to restore serum T3 levels up to those normally maintained by an 
intact thyroid secreting 80% T4 and 20% T3 (82, 83, 88). A similar 
shift in the thyroid hormone profile was observed in the present 
study. However, the encountered deviations from thyroid hor-
mone reference ranges and from controls are modest (Figure 2). 
It should in this context be noted that many biological effects of 
T3 depend on its cellular concentrations, which exhibit a complex 
relationship with the serum T3 concentration (89). A recent study 
with chemically induced hypothyroidism in rats showed a more 
severely reduced tissue T3 than serum FT3, averaging 1–6% of 
the baseline versus 30%, respectively. In addition, the extent of 
tissue T3 reduction, expressed as percentage of the baseline, was 
not homogeneous, with more serious reductions occurring in the 
order: liver = kidney > brain > heart > adipose tissue (90). In 
other words, the finding of slightly decreased circulating FT3 and 
perhaps also FT3 levels in the lower reference range may reflect 
the tip of the iceberg of the genuine T3 deficits in target tissues.
relation With Potential cause(s) of cFs
Some features of CFS resemble those of a persistent response 
to environmental stress known as dauer (hypometabolic state). 
The cell danger response (CDR) is an evolutionarily conserved 
metabolic response, activated when a cell encounters a chemi-
cal, physical, or microbial threat that could injure or kill the cell 
(91). When the CDR is abnormally maintained, whole body 
metabolism and the gut microbiome become disturbed, the func-
tionality of systems and organs becomes impaired and behavior 
is changed, resulting in chronic disease (91). Accordingly, the 
intestinal microbiota and virome have recently been implicated 
in CFS (92), while gene expression data show prominent roles 
for genes involved in immunity and defense (93). Psychological 
trauma, particularly during childhood, can also activate the CDR 
and produce chronic inflammation (91, 94). It has recently been 
shown that CFS patients are endowed with different psychologi-
cal vulnerability factors, notably perfectionism and high moral 
standards (95). These may render them more susceptible to the 
psychological stress of current society, with possible effects on 
the immune system and thyroid axis (56, 62, 79, 80). Finally, the 
aforementioned case–control study by Naviaux et al. (73) showed 
that CFS patients present cellular metabolic responses similar to 
the evolutionarily conserved persistent response to environmen-
tal stress. Thus, the features of hypometabolism that characterize 
CFS may be a consequence of a persisting CDR, either or not 
inflammatory driven.
The current opinion on the causes of CFS may fit mechanistically 
into the presently encountered “low T3 syndrome.” We observed 
a shift from T3 toward rT3 in the investigated CFS patients, who 
exhibited lower T3/T4 ratios and higher rT3/TT3 ratios (Table 1) 
compared to controls. This shift toward rT3 in CFS patients was 
also apparent from their higher %rT3 and lower %TT3, when 
the sum of rT3, TT3 plus TT4 was adjusted to 100% (Table 1). 
These findings, as well as lower urinary iodine in CFS, may be in 
line with higher D3 activity. Low T3 levels in human organs have 
also been found in NTIS (87), but they are more likely to derive 
from deviant pathways of intracellular deiodination than from a 
seriously impaired entry of T3 into cells (87). Induction of D3 in 
muscle may occur in chronic inflammation (34), but D3 may also 
become induced by other factors, such as estradiol, progesterone, 
and growth hormone (96). Such mechanisms may be at the basis 
of CFS symptoms and may explain the lower urinary iodine excre-
tion in CFS patients as compared with controls, although the latter 
also exhibited a relatively high prevalence of low iodine excretion 
(Table 1). Intracellular D3-catalyzed liberation of iodide from T4 
and T3 may serve various antioxidant and defense functions that 
may potentially contribute to high intracellular “thyroid hormone 
consumption,” manifesting as the “low T3 syndrome” with nega-
tive iodine balance in the long term (67, 83, 97).
The lower SPINA-GD (step-up deiodinase activity) and SPINA- 
GT (thyroid secretory capacity) are likely to reflect thy 
roid allo 
-
stasis responses, and the lower protein binding of thyroid hor-
mones, as shown by the lower TT3/FT3 and TT4/FT4 ratios, may 
potentially result in higher metabolism/degradation of thyroid 
hormones. Thyroid allostasis-altered responses have been found 
in NTIS associated with cardiac disease (37), radiation enteritis 
(60) and enterocutaneous fistulas (98). The acute adaptation 
of thyroid hormone metabolism to critical illness may prove 
beneficial to the organism, whereas the more complex alterations 
associated with chronic illness frequently lead to type 1 thyroid 
allostasis (where energy demands exceed the sum of energy intake 
and energy mobilized from stores) (41).
strengths and limitations
Strength of the present case–control study is the performing of 
two sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the association 
of CFS with thyroid parameters and chronic (low-grade) meta-
bolic inflammation. These analyses resulted in some differences, 
but the findings in thyroid parameters remained unchanged. We 
also calculated the %rT3, which may be a more sensitive marker 
for subtle metabolic shifts than concentrations and ratios per se.
Our study also has limitations. There was a lack of information 
on the duration of illness and patient characteristics at diagnosis. 
For instance, dependent on illness duration, different cytokine 
profiles in CFS patients have been reported (99). CFS is likely a 
heterogeneous disease with a common final pathophysiological 
pathway. The present findings are possibly in line with a common 
final pathway, but do not get us closer to the cause(s).
cOnclUsiOn
The most remarkable finding in this CFS case–control study 
was a higher prevalence of the “low T3 syndrome,” attributable 
to a subgroup of CFS patients. Chronic low-grade metabolic 
inflammation was not convincingly noted. Low circulating T3 
may reflect more severely depressed tissue T3 levels. The “low 
T3 syndrome” might be in line with recent metabolomic studies

of NTIS and the low T3 syndrome experienced by a subgroup
