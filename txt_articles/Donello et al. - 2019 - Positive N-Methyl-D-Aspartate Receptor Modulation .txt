Abstract
Background: Modulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors can produce rapid and 
sustained antidepressant effects. Rapastinel (GLYX-13), initially described as a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor partial glycine 
site agonist, exhibits rapid antidepressant effect in rodents without the accompanying dissociative effects of N-methyl-D-
aspartate receptor antagonists.
Methods: The relationship between rapastinel’s in vitro N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor pharmacology and antidepressant 
efficacy was determined by brain microdialysis and subsequent pharmacological characterization of therapeutic rapastinel 
concentrations in N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-specific radioligand displacement, calcium mobilization, and medial 
prefrontal cortex electrophysiology assays.
Results: Brain rapastinel concentrations of 30 to 100 nM were associated with its antidepressant-like efficacy and 
enhancement of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-dependent neuronal intracellular calcium mobilization. Modulation of 
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors by rapastinel was independent of D-serine concentrations, and glycine site antagonists 
did not block rapastinel’s effect. In rat medial prefrontal cortex slices, 100 nM rapastinel increased N-methyl-D-aspartate 
receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents and enhanced the magnitude of long-term potentiation without any 
effect on miniature EPSCs or paired-pulse facilitation responses, indicating postsynaptic action of rapastinel. A critical amino 
acid within the NR2 subunit was identified as necessary for rapastinel’s modulatory effect.
Conclusion: Rapastinel brain concentrations associated with antidepressant-like activity directly enhance medial prefrontal 
cortex N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activity and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated synaptic plasticity in vitro. 
At therapeutic concentrations, rapastinel directly enhances N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activity through a novel site 
independent of the glycine coagonist site. While both rapastinel and ketamine physically target N-methyl-D-aspartate 
receptors, the 2 molecules have opposing actions on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Modest positive modulation of

N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors by rapastinel represents a novel pharmacological approach to promote well-tolerated, rapid, 
and sustained improvements in mood disorders.
Keywords: rapastinel, NMDA receptor, depression
Introduction
Major depressive disorder is a burdensome disease that leads 
to considerable functional impairment. Current antidepres-
sants may take 4 to 8 weeks to achieve full clinical response 
(Posternak and Zimmerman, 2005), and over 50% of patients 
experience inadequate response to first treatment (Warden 
et al., 2007). There is an unmet need for rapid-acting and effec-
tive treatments for depressive symptoms.
Glutamatergic neurotransmission and N-methyl-D-aspartate 
receptors (NMDARs) play important roles in activity-dependent 
synaptic plasticity, learning, and psychiatric disorders (Skolnick 
et al., 1996; Wiescholleck and Manahan-Vaughan, 2013; Gerhard 
et al., 2016). Although research previously concentrated on 
monoamines, dysfunction in glutamatergic systems is also 
an important contributor to depression (Sanacora et al., 2012). 
Antagonism of NMDARs has been suggested to be the pharma-
cological mechanism by which glutamatergic antagonists (i.e., 
ketamine) exert rapid and sustained antidepressant effects 
(Li et al., 2010, 2011; Liu et al., 2012; Niciu et al., 2014; Williams 
and Schatzberg, 2016). Although it is well established that keta-
mine, an uncompetitive NMDAR open channel blocker, rapidly 
relieves depressive symptoms (Berman et al., 2000; Monteggia 
and Zarate, 2015), clinical studies with other NMDAR antago-
nists have shown mixed results (Zarate et al., 2006; Sanacora 
et al., 2017). Recent data also suggest ketamine’s rapid antide-
pressant-like effect may be independent of NMDARs, highlight-
ing the importance of further understanding the pharmacology 
and efficacy of NMDAR modulation in depression (Zanos et al., 
2016; Wohleb et al., 2017; Williams et al., 2018).
Rapastinel (GLYX-13) exerts rapid, sustained antidepressant 
effects in human clinical trials (Preskorn et al., 2015) and in ani-
mal models of depression, including the forced swim test (FST), 
learned helplessness, novelty-induced hypophagia, chronic 
unpredictable stress, and social defeat (Burgdorf et al., 2013, 
2015a, 2015b; Yang et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2017). Unlike ketamine, 
rapastinel has been proposed to enhance NMDAR activity by 
acting as a glycine site functional partial agonist (Moskal et al., 
2014), although systematic investigation of its interaction with 
NMDARs has not been performed. Whole-cell electrophysiologi-
cal techniques in CA1 pyramidal neurons of rat hippocampal 
slices demonstrated that rapastinel, in the absence of an NMDAR 
glycine site agonist, elicits an NMDAR channel current (Moskal 
et al., 2005, 2014; Zhang et al., 2008) of approximately 20% of the 
maximum amplitude generated by the NMDAR glycine site full 
agonist D-serine (Moskal et al., 2014). Low rapastinel concentra-
tions have also been shown to enhance induction of long-term 
potentiation (LTP) at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses (Burgdorf 
et al., 2013; Moskal et al., 2014). Interestingly, despite potentially 
opposing effects of rapastinel and ketamine on NMDAR activ-
ity, the antidepressant-like effects of rapastinel and ketamine 
both require AMPA receptor (AMPAR) activation and increased 
mTORC1 signaling (Maeng et al., 2008; Li et al., 2010; Koike et al., 
2011; Burgdorf et al., 2013; Zanos et al., 2016).
The following experiments were designed to characterize 
rapastinel NMDAR pharmacology and further characterize its 
antidepressant mechanism of action. Herein, extracellular levels 
of rapastinel in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) at its effective 
antidepressant doses were assessed to determine if rapastinel’s 
antidepressant efficacy is due to enhancement or inhibition of 
NMDAR activity. We also examined rapastinel’s modulation of 
recombinantly expressed NMDAR subtypes, isolated cortical 
neuron NMDAR activity, and native NMDAR ionotropic effects 
in mPFC tissue slices. Finally, we characterized the impact and 
concentration-response profile of rapastinel and S-ketamine 
on LTP formation, a cellular substrate of learning and memory 
elicited by NMDAR activation (Malenka and Bear, 2004) at mixed 
excitatory synapses in layer III/IV of the mPFC.
Materials and Methods
Animals
All experiments were approved by the Allergan Institutional 
Animal Care and Use Committee and carried out in accord-
ance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals 
as adopted and promulgated by the US National Institutes of 
Health.
Drugs
Rapastinel was synthesized in free-base form by Sai Life 
Sciences (India). S-ketamine was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich 
(St. Louis, MO). For behavioral and microdialysis studies, rapasti-
nel and S-ketamine were dissolved in sterile saline (0.9% NaCl) 
and administered s.c. or i.p., respectively.
Significance Statement
Major depressive disorder (MDD) treatments often take weeks to produce a response, and nearly one-half of all patients fail to 
adequately respond to treatment. Antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) produces rapid and sustained clini-
cally relevant antidepressant effects, but drugs like ketamine also induce psychotomimetic or dissociative side effects that limit 
clinical use. Rapastinel, an investigational MDD treatment, was reported to act as a glycine site NMDAR partial agonist, but it was 
unclear if its antidepressant-like activity was due to enhancement or inhibition of NMDAR activity. Using a variety of techniques, 
including rodent behavioral testing, microdialysis, calcium imaging, and in vitro and ex vivo electrophysiology, we found that 
rapastinel brain concentrations that induce antidepressant-like effects directly enhance NMDAR activity and synaptic plasticity 
via a novel domain independent of the glycine coagonist site. Rapastinel and ketamine have opposite pharmacological effects on 
NMDAR activity, and rapastinel enhances NMDAR activity to trigger rapid antidepressant-like effects.

FST
FST adapted for use in rats was performed as previously 
described (Burgdorf et al., 2015b). On day 1 (habituation), rats 
were placed in a transparent cylindrical tube (46 cm tall × 20 cm 
diameter) filled to 30 cm with water (23°C ± 1°C) for 15 min-
utes. Water was changed after every other rat; tests were vide-
otaped. Rats were injected with rapastinel (3, 10, or 30 mg/kg, 
s.c.), S-ketamine (3, 10, or 30 mg/kg, i.p.), or vehicle (sterile saline 
[1 mL/kg], s.c.) and tested at 60 minutes and 7 days postdose. For 
testing, rats were placed in the cylindrical tube for 5 minutes and 
recorded with a computerized video-system Smart 3.0 (Harvard 
Apparatus). Total time each rat spent immobile, defined as the 
minimal amount of effort required to keep head above water, 
was scored by a trained, blinded observer.
Microdialysis
Microdialysis experiments were performed in freely moving 
rats as previously described (Kehr and Yoshitake, 2006). Guide 
cannulae were implanted into mPFC at the coordinates: AP, 
+3.2 mm; L, +0.5 mm; V, −1.5 mm, specified from bregma and the 
dural brain surface according to the atlas of Paxinos and Watson 
(2007); the mPFC location was at V −4.5 mm, which was achieved 
with the length of the microdialysis probe tip. Following 7 days 
of recovery, a microdialysis probe (3-mm membrane length, 
50 kDa cutoff) was inserted into the guide cannula, and mPFC 
was dialyzed with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; flow rate: 
1 μL/min) containing (in mM): 148 NaCl, 4 KCl, 0.8 MgCl2, 1.4 
CaCl2, 1.2 Na2HPO4, and 0.3 NaH2PO4 (pH 7.2). Following 3-hour 
stabilization, samples were collected in 20-minute intervals, 3 
at baseline levels and then for an additional 4 hours following 
drug administration. Rapastinel concentrations were measured 
by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass 
spectrometry as described previously (Kehr and Yoshitake, 2017).
Target Specificity Assays
Displacement of radioligands by 30 μM S-ketamine, R-ketamine, 
(R,S)-ketamine, and rapastinel was analyzed in side-by-side 
experiments from 28 different NMDA and non-NMDAR binding 
sites. Dose-dependent displacement effects were analyzed in 
identified targets using a high-throughput electrophysiological 
system (IonWorks Barracuda system).
[3H] MK-801 Potentiation Assay
Membrane Preparation
Crude membranes were prepared using transiently transfected, 
human NR2A-D subtype-expressing HEK cells. All procedures 
were performed at 4°C. Briefly, pelleted cells were washed 
in 10 mM Tris·acetate (pH 7.4, 4°C), pelleted, and frozen over-
night (–80°C). The pellet was resuspended and homogenized (30 
strokes) in a glass homogenizer, pelleted at 51 
500 × g for 30 min-
utes at 4°C, and stored at –80ºC until assay.
Potentiation Assay
Membrane extract protein (300 µg) was preincubated for 15 
minutes at 25°C in the presence of saturating concentrations 
of glutamate (50 µM) and varying concentrations of rapastinel. 
Following addition of 0.3 mCi of [3H] MK-801 (Amersham, 22.5 
Ci/mmol), reactions were incubated for 15 additional minutes 
(nonequilibrium conditions). Bound and free [3H] MK-801 were 
separated via rapid filtration. Zero levels were determined in the 
absence of glycine. Percent maximal [3H] MK-801 binding was 
calculated relative to stimulation measured in the presence of 
1 mM glycine and 50 µM glutamate. Binding curves were fitted 
using GraphPad.
Neuronal Cultures
Rat brain cortical neurons were obtained from Lonza (R-CX-500; 
Basel, Switzerland). Cortical cells from embryonic day 18 and 19 
were seeded onto poly-D-lysine-coated coverslips and cultured 
per manufacturer’s instructions with slight modifications for 
cell thawing and culture initiation. Briefly, after removal from 
liquid nitrogen, cells were heated to 37°C for 2.5 minutes and 
added to prewarmed medium (Lonza Primary Neuron Basal 
Medium with 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 μg/mL gentamicin, 37 ng/mL 
 
amphotericin, and 2% [v/v] NSF-1) with manual rotation for 2 
minutes before being mixed by inversion twice. The cell suspen-
sion was plated onto coverslips and incubated for 1 hour (37°C, 
5% CO2). Following incubation, medium containing 10% (v/v) 
fetal bovine serum (FBS) was added; suspension was further 
incubated for 3 hours, at which point one-half of the medium 
was replaced with fresh medium containing 10% FBS. The cul-
ture was incubated for 3 to 4 days, and then one-half of the 
medium was replaced with fresh FBS-free medium. For the 
next 2 weeks, 500 μL medium was replaced with 1 mL FBS-free 
medium twice weekly. Cells were used 10 to 28 days following 
culture initiation.
Intracellular Ca2+ Influx Measurement
Dye Loading
Before recording, coverslips containing neuronal culture were 
removed from the incubator, and medium was removed by 
washing thrice with extracellular medium (ECM) containing 
(in mM): 145 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 10 HEPES, 11 D-glucose, 1.8 CaCl2, 
0.000075 TTX, and 0.002 NBQX (pH 7.4). All test compounds were 
dissolved in ECM. Coverslips were transferred to 35-mm cell 
culture dishes containing 2.5 mL ECM and 2 μM nonfluorescent 
acetoxymethyl ester (fluo-4-AM; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) 
and incubated for 25 minutes at room temperature (RT). Cells 
were washed in ECM and incubated for another 25 minutes to 
allow complete deesterification of intracellular acetoxymethyl 
esters.
Optical Recording
Fluo-4-AM loaded cells were continuously perfused at a con-
stant rate of 2 to 3 mL/min with ECM at RT in a recording 
chamber mounted on an Olympus BX61WI fixed-stage upright 
microscope equipped with Olympus FluoView confocal imag-
ing system and 20× objective (0.5W). Fluo-4 was excited with 
an argon laser (488 nm), and digital fluorescence images were 
captured every 2 seconds. Compounds were applied through 
a homemade local drug application system with 90% solution 
exchange time in <1 second.
Data Analysis
Image data were analyzed offline with FV-ASW software 
(Olympus). Cells were selected based on positive response to 
maximum stimulation by 10 μM NMDA + 3 μM D-serine. Regions 
of interest were manually circled around cell bodies; average 
fluorescence intensities were calculated and plotted for each 
cell. Data from individual cells were averaged for each cover-
slip and calculated as mean ±  SEM. Fluorescence changes under 
each condition were calculated by subtracting mean intensity

10 to 30 seconds before drug application from those 10 to 30 
seconds after drug application. Change in fluorescence by 10 μM 
NMDA or NMDA + rapastinel was compared with 10 μM NMDA + 
3 μM D-serine, which produced close-to-maximum signal under 
the current experimental conditions. The raspastinel effect was 
normalized to the signal induced by NMDA “alone.” Cells with-
out significant NMDA “alone” response (<2% maximum) were 
excluded.
Electrophysiology
Whole-Cell Patch-Clamp Recordings From Cultured Neurons
Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were conducted in cultured 
cortical neurons 3 weeks at RT. Glass micropipettes were filled 
with intracellular solution containing (in mM): 120 Cs-gluconate, 
5 NaCl, 10 KCl, 1 EGTA, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 2 ATP, 10 phosphocre-
atine, and 0.25 GTP (pH 7.3, 290 mOsm). Ionic currents were meas-
ured using an AxoPatch 200B (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) 
filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz. Whole-cell voltage-
clamp configuration was established; cells were held at –60 mV 
or +40 mV. Fast application of NMDA with or without D-serine 
and/or rapastinel was applied through a homemade local drug 
application system with 90% solution exchange time in <1 sec-
ond. Rapastinel was preapplied for 30 seconds before 15 seconds 
of coapplication of rapastinel + NMDA. Amplitudes of sustained 
currents were measured as mean current 12 to 14 seconds after 
agonist application over the 2-second interval.
Preparation of mPFC Slices.
Coronal slices containing mPFC were prepared from 6- to 
10-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats were deeply anes-
thetized with isoflurane and decapitated. Brains were rapidly 
removed and submerged in ice-cold, oxygenated aCSF (2°C–4°C) 
containing (in mM): 124 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 1.25 
NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, and 10 D-glucose (pH 7.4, gassed continu-
ously with 95% O2/5% CO2). aCSF was made with deionized, dis-
tilled water (resistance >18 MΩ/cm2; Milli-Q system; Millipore) 
and salts (Sigma or Fluka). Brains were hemisected, frontal lobes 
removed, and individual hemispheres glued using cyanoacr-
ylate adhesive to a stage immersed in ice-cold, oxygenated 
aCSF. Modified coronal slices containing prelimbic and infralim-
bic regions were cut at 300-µm thickness using Vibratome (Leica 
VT1200S), as previously described (Parent et al., 2010). Slices were 
transferred to an interface holding chamber containing oxygen-
ated aCSF for incubation at RT for >1 hour before transferring to 
a Haas-style interface recording chamber continuously perfused 
at 3 mL/min with oxygenated aCSF (32°C ± 0.5°C). For all record-
ings, the bath solution (aCSF) contained (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 
KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, and 10 dextrose. 
Picrotoxin (20 µM) was present throughout the experiments to 
partially reduce inhibitory tone.
Whole-Cell Recordings in mPFC Neurons
Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from layer II/III mPFC pyram-
idal neurons were acquired as previously described (Burgdorf 
et al., 2013). Patch pipette resistance ranged from 6 to 6.5 MΩ 
when filled with intracellular solution that contained (in mM): 135 
CsMeSO2, 8 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 0.2 EGTA, 2 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, and 
1 QX-314 (pH 7.25 [adjusted with Cs(OH)2], 275 mOsm). Pyramidal 
neurons within 80 µm of the slice surface were visualized by 
infrared differential interference imaging and selected for patch-
ing by nonswollen pyramidal shape with a 60× water-immersion 
objective mounted to a Zeiss microscope (Axioskop 2 FS plus). 
After whole-cell voltage-clamp configuration was established, 
access resistance was carefully monitored; only cells with sta-
ble access resistance <10% of input resistance that changed <5% 
over the course of the experiment were included in analyses. 
Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and spontaneous min-
iature EPSCs (in 6 mM KCl aCSF) were recorded using MultiClamp 
700B (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA), with low-pass filter set-
ting at 1 to 3 kHz. Series resistance was compensated in voltage-
clamp mode; patched cells whose series resistance changed by 
>10% were rejected from analysis. Signals were filtered at 3 kHz 
and digitized at 10 kHz with a Digidata 1322A controlled by 
Clampex (v9.2, Molecular Devices). A bipolar tungsten stimulating 
electrode (FHC, Bowdoin, ME) was placed in mPFC mixed effer-
ent pathways; stimulus pulses (200-µs duration) were delivered 
at 30-second intervals. Neurons were voltage-clamped at –70 mV 
to record EPSCs to assess input-output relations and paired-pulse 
facilitation. Neurons were clamped at –40 mV for recording NMDA 
currents, to relieve voltage-dependent magnesium block, and 
slices were perfused with aCSF containing 3 mM calcium, 20 µM 
picrotoxin, and 10 µM NBQX, to isolate NMDA conductances.
fEPSP and LTP Induction in mPFC Neurons
For extracellular fEPSP recordings, low-resistance recording elec-
trodes were made from thin-walled borosilicate glass (1–2 MΩ after 
filling with aCSF) and inserted into layers III/IV of the prelimbic 
region of the mPFC. A bipolar stainless-steel stimulating electrode 
(FHC Co.) was placed on mixed efferent input pathways in mPFC, 
which include hippocampal inputs, close to the recording elec-
trode, and constant current stimulus intensity adjusted to evoke 
approximately half-maximal fEPSPs every 30 seconds (50–100 µA; 
100-μs duration). fEPSP slope was measured before and after induc-
tion of LTP by linear interpolation from 20% to 80% of maximum 
negative deflection, and slopes were confirmed as stable to within 
±10% for ≥15 minutes before commencing an experiment. Drug 
treatment started approximately 20 minutes prior to theta burst 
stimulus trains (TBS). LTP was induced by stimulation of the mixed 
efferent pathway with 3 high-frequency TBS of 10 × 100 Hz with 
5-pulse bursts each, applied at 200-ms inter-burst intervals. Each 
train was of 2-second duration, and trains were applied 3 minutes 
apart. Signals were recorded using a differential AC amplifier (A-M 
Systems, Model 1700) and digitized with an 
A/D board (1608GX-2AO) 
using SciWorks (v9.1, DataWave) on an IBM-compatible computer. 
Data were analyzed initially with Clampfit (v9, Axon Instruments) 
and further processed with Origin 6.1 (Microcal Software) and 
CorelDraw 10.0 (Corel). Normalized LTP magnitude was calculated 
for each slice as ratio of mean slope 47 to 50 minutes following TBS 
vs 0 to 3 minutes prior to TBS. Dunnett’s test or paired t test was 
used for statistical analyses; data are presented as mean ± SEM.
Paired-Pulse Profile Recordings in mPFC
Population compound action potential (population spike, PS) 
magnitudes were measured as amplitude, defined as vertical 
distance from negative peak of PS to mean positive peaks on 
either side. PSs were evoked at a stimulus intensity that elic-
ited 50% maximal amplitude for the first pulse spike. A series 
of inter-pulse intervals, 10- to 1000-ms duration, was used to 
study paired-pulse profiles. Four sweeps of PSs were recorded 
for each inter-pulse interval per slice; responses were averaged. 
The ratio of the second evoked PS amplitude (PS2) to the first 
(PS1) was used to determine depression or facilitation, with a 
ratio >1 corresponding to facilitation and a ratio <1 to depres-
sion. Experiments were performed in absence of drug and 
repeated after 30-minute bath application of 100 nM rapastinel. 
EPSPs were evoked every 30 seconds during drug application to 
monitor changes in baseline activity.

Statistical Analysis
Analysis of FST data was performed using Prism 6 statisti-
cal software (GraphPad Software); values were calculated as 
mean ± SEM, and differences were considered to be statisti-
cally significant at P < .05. The mean basal levels in the control 
and treated groups were compared by use of 1-way ANOVA 
followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. Paired t test 
(Excel) was implemented for calcium imaging and patch-clamp 
experiments. Effects of rapastinel on pharmacologically isolated 
NMDAR-mediated EPSCs, paired-pulse facilitation, and fre-
quency and amplitude of spontaneous miniature EPSCs in mPFC 
pyramidal neurons were assessed by paired t test comparing 
pre-drug baselines to values in each cell following 20 minutes 
of drug bath application. Effects of rapastinel on magnitude of 
LTP in mPFC slices 47 to 50 minutes post-TBS were evaluated by 
1-way ANOVA, followed by Fisher’s Least Significant Difference 
test comparing each concentration to the magnitude of LTP in 
untreated control slices.
Results
Rapastinel Produced Sustained Antidepressant-Like 
Effects
We first determined the extracellular concentrations of 
rapastinel in rat mPFC associated with antidepressant-like 
actions. A single administration of either rapastinel (10 and 
30 mg/kg, s.c.) or S-ketamine (10 and 30 mg/kg, i.p.) was suf-
ficient to produce a rapid (within 1 hour) and sustained 
(>7 days) dose-dependent antidepressant-like effect (Figure 
1A). Microdialysis studies in rats revealed that rapastinel rap-
idly distributed in the brain, with a Tmax of approximately 20 
minutes and a half-life of approximately 20 minutes in extra-
cellular fluid. Minimal and maximal rapastinel antidepressant 
efficacy was associated with brain concentrations of approxi-
mately 30 nM (10 mg/kg) and approximately 100 nM (30 mg/
kg), respectively (Figure 1B). Similar concentrations of rapasti-
nel were used in in vitro assays characterizing rapastinel’s 
interaction with NMDAR.
Rapastinel Does Not Bind to NMDAR Glycine 
Coagonist Site in Radioligand Displacement Assays
Rapastinel did not displace radioligand from any of the known 
NMDAR ligand sites, including the NMDAR glycine coagonist 
site, demonstrating that, contrary to previous reports, it does not 
bind to the NMDAR glycine site. Ketamine stereoisomers signifi-
cantly displaced radioligand from the NMDAR PCP/MK-801 site 
(Table 1).
S-ketamine additionally inhibited radioligand binding to 
opioid receptors (μ and κ opioid receptors) and serotonin trans-
porter (5-HTT) sites, and inhibited α3β4 and α7 nicotinic acetyl-
choline receptor channel activity (supplementary Tables 1 and 
2). In contrast, 30 µM rapastinel did not have a significant effect 
at any of these sites (supplementary Tables 1 and 2).
Rapastinel Modulates Channel Conformation of 
NMDARs Containing Any of the Four NR2 Receptor 
Subtypes A-D
Using membranes derived from HEK cells expressing recombi-
nant human NR1 and NR2 NMDAR subtypes, we assessed the 
ability of rapastinel to modulate glutamate-induced binding of 
[3H] MK-801 to the NMDAR channel pore (Urwyler et al., 2009). 
This assay detects conformational receptor changes, potentially 
including pregated states that precede ion flux (Erreger et al., 
2005). Glycine enhanced [3H] MK-801 binding with an EC50 of 100 to 
350 nM at NR2A-D subtypes (Figure 2A–D; supplementary Table 3). 
Compared with glycine, rapastinel partially enhanced [3H] MK-801 
binding but with greater potency than glycine (EC50 of 9.8 pM, 
9.9 nM, 2.2 pM, and 1.7 pM at the NR2A-D subtypes, respectively).

cium ([Ca2+]i) mobilization was assessed in rat primary corti-
cal neurons. NMDA and D-serine exhibited EC50s of 2.8 μM and

exogenous D-serine, promoted a small, reproducible increase in 
[Ca2+]i as measured by an increase in fluo-4 fluorescence (Figure 
2E). S-ketamine fully inhibited NMDAR-mediated [Ca2+]i accu-
mulation in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 
approximately 1.0 μM (Figure 2F). Application of rapastinel (all 
tested concentrations) in the absence of NMDA had no effect 
on baseline NMDAR activity or Ca2+ fluorescence. However, in 
the presence of 10 μM NMDA, 10 to 300 nM rapastinel enhanced 
NMDA-induced Ca2+ influx by approximately 30%, whereas 
concentrations ≥1 μM partially inhibited (approximately 25%) 
NMDAR activity (Figure 2E–F). The potentiation effect of 100 nM 
rapastinel on NMDA-induced current was analyzed in cultured 
cortical neurons under whole-cell patch-clamp recordings 
(Figure 3). NMDAR-mediated currents were recorded at −60 mV 
or +40 mV in Mg2+-free solution. As shown in Figure 3B, rapasti-
nel’s effect is independent on the membrane potential. In the 
presence of 0.8 mM Mg2+, NMDA-induced currents were able to 
be recorded when the membrane potentials were held at +40 
mV. Under this relevant physiological condition, rapastinel sig-
nificantly enhanced NMDAR current (Figure 3C).

NMDA + rapastinel (or S-ketamine), 10 μM NMDA, and 10 μM NMDA + 3 μM D-serine. (F) Enhancement and inhibition of 10 μM NMDA-induced [Ca2+]i increase is concen-
tration specific with rapastinel (n = 3–8), whereas S-ketamine blocks the response in a concentration-dependent fashion (n = 4–8). Data are mean ± SEM.

Radioligand displacement at NMDAR binding sites by 30 μM S-, R-, and (R,S)-ketamine and rapastinel was analyzed in side-by-side experiments. All ketamine isomers 
showed meaningful inhibition at the MK-801 and PCP NMDA sites, whereas rapastinel did not show any affinity for any tested NMDAR binding sites. Results which 
show an inhibition greater than 50% (numbers in bold) are considered to represent meaningful inhibition of the test compound.

rapastinel induced a modest, constant enhancement of NMDA-
induced calcium response, irrespective of increasing D-serine 
concentrations. However, 100 nM rapastinel did not enhance 
maximum NMDAR activity stimulated by 10 μM NMDA + 3 μM 
D-serine (Figure 4A). In the presence of 3 μM D-serine, 100 nM 
rapastinel also enhanced NMDA-induced calcium response at 
submaximal NMDA concentrations (3–5 μM) (Figure 4B). In con-
trast, increasing either D-serine or NMDA concentrations had 
little impact on the inhibitory effect of 1 μM rapastinel (Figure 
4C–D). The concentration-specific potentiation/inhibition profile 
of rapastinel was similar in cortical neurons and HEK cells het-
erologously expressing NR2A/NR1 or NR2B/NR1 NMDAR (Figure 
4E), stimulated with 3 μM NMDA + 3 μM D-serine or 100 nM 
glutamate + 3 μM D-serine, respectively. Low concentrations 
of rapastinel (30–100 nM) enhanced NMDAR-induced calcium 
responses, whereas ≥1 μM rapastinel weakly inhibited these 
responses (Figure 4E). Rapastinel’s inhibitory activity was inde-
pendent of agonist or coagonist concentrations.
NMDAR Activity Is Modulated by Rapastinel in the 
Presence of the Competitive Glycine Site Antagonists 
7-Chlorokynurenic Acid or MDL 105,519
The compounds 7-chlorokynurenic acid (7-CK) and MDL 105,519 
(MDL) are potent glycine coagonist site NMDAR antagonists. 
Radioligand binding experiments showed that 7-CK had an IC50 of 
0.56 μM at the strychnine-insensitive [3H] glycine binding site, and 
100 μM 7-CK completely blocked NMDAR current in rat cortical 
slices (Kemp et al., 1988). MDL is significantly more potent and 
completely inhibited the binding of [3H] glycine to rat brain mem-
branes with a Ki of 10.9 nM (Baron et al., 1997). In the cultured 
cortical neuron calcium assay, 300 μM 7-CK or 10 μM MDL com-
pletely abolished 10 μM NMDA-induced calcium response (Figure 
4F–G); this also suggests that nonsaturating levels of endogenous 
coagonist existed within the assay. Importantly, 10 μM MDL also 
blocked (−98.5 ± 0.2%, n = 5) the activation of NMDARs by 10 μM 
NMDA and 100 μM D-serine. Thus, 300 μM 7-CK or 10 μM MDL is 
at an excess, saturating concentration, which fully antagonized 
the glycine coagonist site. Saturating concentrations of gly-
cine antagonists, even without addition of exogenous D-serine, 
did not antagonize the activity of 100 nM rapastinel (Figure 
4G). Although 300 μM 7-CK or 10 μM MDL abolished the activ-
ity of 10 μM NMDA, additional co-infusion of 100 nM rapastinel 
restored activity, as evidenced by a small [Ca2+]i increase similar 
in magnitude to the overall enhancement induced by rapasti-
nel in other conditions (Figure 4F–G). Furthermore, co-infusion 
of 100 μM (2R)-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate—a competitive 
glutamate binding site NMDAR antagonist—inhibited the cal-
cium response (Figure 4F–G), suggesting that rapastinel’s effect is 
NMDAR mediated but independent of the glycine coagonist site. 
This is further confirmed by [3H] MK-801 binding at mutant NR1-
NR2B receptors with NR1 subunits containing a loss-of-function 
mutation in the glycine binding site (F484A/T518L). Whereas gly-
cine failed to enhance [3H] MK-801 binding at mutant receptors 
(Figure 5A), rapastinel enhanced [3H] MK-801 binding equally in 
cells expressing wild-type or mutant NR1 subunits (Figure 5B).

Potential Effective Site of Rapastinel
Molecular modeling in silico identified a potential high-affinity 
rapastinel binding site within the amino terminal domain. Point 
mutagenesis of critical amino acids within the predicted binding 
domain (R392E in NR2A and analogous R393E in NR2B) did not signif-
icantly alter the pharmacological activity of glutamate or D-serine. 
For the NR2A receptor, 3 μM D-serine and 100 nM glutamate acti-
vated the wild-type receptor (32.8 ± 3.5% of 1 μM glutamate; n = 13), 
and the mutant NR2A (R392E) was not significantly different (29.4 ± 
3.0%; n = 16; P = .46 vs wild-type NR2A, Student’s t test). For the NR2B 
receptor, 100 nM glutamate also activated both the wild-type (22.3 ± 
2.6%; n = 14) and mutated (R393E) receptor (22.6 ± 1.2%; n = 19; P = .92 
vs wild-type NR2B, Student t test). Despite the similar response of 
mutated receptors to glutamate and D-serine, the point mutation in 
both receptor subtypes completely abolished the potentiation and 
inhibition of glutamate-induced intracellular calcium mobilization 
by 100 nM and 1 μM rapastinel, respectively.
Rapastinel Enhances NMDAR-Mediated EPSCs in Rat 
Pyramidal Neurons in mPFC Slices
Using whole-cell patch clamp recording, exposure to 100 nM 
rapastinel enhanced NMDAR-dependent EPSCs in mPFC pyrami-
dal neurons without altering current kinetics (Figure 6A), pre-
synaptic glutamate release assessed by paired-pulse response 
(Figure 6B), or spontaneous miniature EPSC frequency or ampli-
tude (Figure 6C).
Rapastinel, but Not S-Ketamine, Potentiates the 
Induction of NMDAR-Dependent LTP
Bath application of increasing concentrations of rapastinel 20 
minutes prior to TBS produced a biphasic enhancement of the 
magnitude of LTP. Low rapastinel concentrations significantly 
increased the magnitude of LTP, with maximal effect observed at 
100 nM, whereas high rapastinel concentrations (1 μM) reduced 
LTP magnitude (Figure 6D–E). In contrast, increasing concentra-
tions of S-ketamine dose-dependently inhibited LTP formation 
at all concentrations tested, with complete blockade observed 
at 3 μM (Figure 6E).
Discussion
Rapastinel has been established as an important new compound 
in psychiatry. It is a positive NMDAR modulator that has been 
shown to produce rapid-acting and long-lasting antidepres-
sant effects, with a lower propensity than ketamine to induce 
dissociative and psychotomimetic side effects (Preskorn et al., 
2015). Significant acute effects on obsessions and compulsions 
were also seen in a recent obsessive-compulsive clinical trial 
(Rodriguez et al., 2016). This study reveals that rapastinel has a

**P < .01, paired t test), and 3 μM D-serine and varying concentrations of NMDA (B,D; n = 8–13, **P < .01, paired t test). Data are normalized to 10 μM NMDA+3 μM D-serine,

novel mechanism of action, which mediates its antidepressant 
actions; thus, a novel target site and mechanism of glutamater-
gic modulation may exist for the treatment of mood disorders.
The data herein demonstrate that rapastinel modulates 
NMDARs directly and can enhance or decrease receptor activ-
ity via a novel pharmacological mechanism. Rapastinel does not 
require glycine or the glycine binding site to enable glutamate-
induced receptor activation, demonstrating that it is a coagonist 
with glutamate rather than a functional glycine site partial ago-
nist as previously thought (Zhang et al., 2008; Burgdorf et al., 
2013; Moskal et al., 2014; Preskorn et al., 2015). Our data show 
that maximal modulation of receptor, either activation or inhi-
bition, is in the range of 20% of the maximum possible activa-
tion/inhibition of the receptor (Figure 2F). Although further 
experimentation is required to fully characterize the rapasti-
nel binding site, initial evidence suggests that this modulation 
occurs through its potential interaction at a unique binding 
domain near the amino terminal-ligand binding interface of the 
receptor. Thus, the potent but modest positive modulation of 
NMDARs by rapastinel represents a unique therapeutic profile 
that is effective, well tolerated (Preskorn et al., 2015; Rodriguez 
et al., 2016), and sufficient to treat CNS disorders associated with 
diminished glutamatergic tone or synaptic strength with mini-
mal or no negative side effects.
Recently, there have been several NMDAR antagonists (eg, 
ifenprodil, ketamine, and S-ketamine) and one partial agonist 
(D-cycloserine) tested in depression clinical trials. Of these, 
ketamine has been the most thoroughly studied. Based on keta-
mine’s rapid-acting and long-lasting antidepressant effects, cou-
pled with its NMDAR channel-blocking properties, the prevailing 
idea has been that NMDAR antagonism is how an effective gluta-
matergic modulator must work to be antidepressant. Using keta-
mine as a comparator, there are several noteworthy observations 
to be made. First, the idea that ketamine’s antidepressant actions 
are due to direct NMDAR inhibition is still being investigated. 
Miller et al. (2016) suggested that both rapid and sustained anti-
depressant effects of ketamine are dependent on a presynaptic 
surge of glutamate release triggered by GABAergic interneuron 
disinhibition, which, in turn, activates pyramidal cell AMPARs. In 
contrast to ketamine, rapastinel does not affect presynaptic glu-
tamate release as assessed by paired-pulse response and minia-
ture EPSC frequency. Zanos et al. (2016) reported that ketamine’s 
Figure 5. Rapastinel functional site is different from the glycine binding site. (A) Glycine increased [3H] MK-801 binding in wild-type NR1-NR2B controls but not in 
NR1-NR2B-expressing HEK cells containing a loss of function mutation in the glycine binding site (F484A/T518L) (n = 18). (B) Rapastinel increased [3H] MK-801 binding 
in both wild-type and glycine mutant cells (n = 18, 2-tailed t test). The modulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA)-induced intracellular calcium response of 
rapastinel was abolished in HEK293 cells transiently transfected with a (C) R392E mutation in NR2A and (D) R393E mutation in NR2B. Data are mean ± SEM.

antidepressant properties are due to its metabolite(s), which is 
the agent that actually activates AMPAR activity. Rajagopal et al. 
(2016) have reported that rapastinel rescues ketamine-induced 
declarative memory deficits in mice. Clearly, ketamine is working 
by a different mechanism than rapastinel. Since the psychotomi-
metic and rewarding effects of ketamine are linked to surges of 
glutamate and dopamine efflux, respectively (Moghaddam et al., 
1997; Lorrain et al., 2003; Valentine et al., 2011; Abdallah et al., 
2015), our data suggest that the absence of psychotomimetic-like 
effects with rapastinel is likely due to its lack of effect on presyn-
aptic glutamate release. Most importantly, rapastinel concen-
trations sufficient to enhance mPFC NMDAR activity and mPFC 
synaptic plasticity in vitro are sufficient to trigger antidepres-
sant-like activity in vivo. Taken together, these data suggest that 
rapastinel’s rapid antidepressant-like activity is initiated by a 
direct postsynaptic enhancement of NMDAR-gated conductance 
that persistently enhances the magnitude of NMDAR-mediated 
synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses in the mPFC. This is 
consistent with previous work that demonstrated rapastinel’s 
antidepressant activity was blocked by the NMDAR antagonist 
CPP (Burgdorf et al., 2015b).
To understand rapastinel’s in vivo mechanism of action, 
mPFC concentrations associated with efficacy and its impact 
on target cell NMDAR function must be characterized. Focal 
infusion of rapastinel in the mPFC induces antidepressant-like 
effects (Burgdorf et al., 2013), and rapastinel exhibits a simi-
lar dose response across a wide range of depression models. 
Rapastinel mPFC concentrations of 30–100 nM were sufficient to 
induce rapid and long-lasting antidepressant-like response. In 
vitro, 100 nM rapastinel was sufficient to significantly enhance 
mPFC isolated neuron NMDAR-dependent calcium mobiliza-
tion, mPFC pyramidal cell peak NMDAR current, and mPFC 
LTP. Previous studies have focused upon hippocampal CA1 
neurons and the electrophysiological effect of 1 μM rapastinel, 
reporting that 1 µM rapastinel reduced peak NMDAR current, 
spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents, and spontane-
ous EPSCs in these neurons (Zhang et al., 2008; Widman and 
McMahon, 2018). However, we find that lower, efficacious con-
centrations of rapastinel (30–100 nM) had the opposite effect as 
it directly enhanced NMDAR activity and mPFC synaptic plas-
ticity. Rapastinel exhibits an unusual inverted U-dose response 
on recombinantly expressed NMDARs, mPFC NMDAR current, 
hippocampal and mPFC LTP, animal models of depression, and 
a human depression clinical trial. A notable exception was 
the MK-801 accumulation assay, which did not exhibit this 
same U-shaped dose response; however, the MK-801 assay is 
Figure 6. Rapastinel potentiates N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and acutely enhances long-term poten-

a nonequilibrium assay that detects NMDAR conformational 
changes, which then allows MK-801 access to the channel pore, 
and it is unclear how the conformational changes relate to 
activation or inactivation of NMDAR ionotropic activity. Given 
rapastinel does not compete for the natural ligand agonist or 
co-agonist site, further in-depth investigation of the rapasti-
nel’s modulatory action is necessary to understand the mecha-
nism by which high concentrations of rapastinel weakly inhibit 
NMDARs. This general U-shaped dose response raises an inter-
esting possibility that higher peak drug concentrations, which 
weakly inhibit NMDARs, may be less effective or even coun-
teract the effect of lower concentrations that directly enhance 
NMDAR function. Regardless, the novel findings that rapastinel 
is more potent in the mPFC and the elucidation of the effica-
cious mPFC concentrations has clarified that rapastinel likely 
evokes antidepressant-like activity by direct enhancement of 
NMDAR-triggered synaptic plasticity.
In addition to inducing long-lasting changes in synap-
tic strength, altering NMDAR activity can shift the threshold 
for induction of future activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, 
phenomena referred to as “metaplasticity,” which come in a 
variety of related forms and mechanisms (Vose and Stanton, 
2017). Both ketamine and rapastinel administered in vivo 
can elicit metaplastic shifts that result in larger LTP, and this 
enhancement in LTP appears to be required for antidepressant 
activity outlasting drug presence (Burgdorf et al., 2013; Izumi 
and Zorumski, 2014). These data suggest that either blocking 
or enhancing NMDAR activity can activate long-lasting meta-
plasticity that promotes induction of LTP-mediating persistent 
antidepressant actions.
Through a variety of techniques, this study sought to more 
fully describe the in vitro and in vivo NMDAR pharmacology of 
rapastinel. The measurement of NMDAR-dependent intracellu-
lar calcium accumulation has proven to be a critical assay to 
identify and characterize rapastinel’s modest NMDAR modula-
tory effect. Although highly reproducible and sensitive, the cal-
cium imaging is an amplified assay with a limited linear range; 
however, these properties are ideal for identifying and charac-
terizing a modest modulatory effect. Given this moderate effect, 
it will be difficult but important for future studies to extend 
rapastinel’s dose response and ligand dependence with an elec-
trophysiological study of rapastinel’s modulatory effect on cur-
rent of recombinantly-expressed NMDARs.
In conclusion, positive modulation of NMDARs by rapasti-
nel exhibits rapid and long-lasting antidepressant properties 
with a lower propensity than ketamine to induce dissociative 
and psychotomimetic side effects. Rapastinel’s mechanism of 
action is unique and involves NMDAR activation via binding 
to a novel domain. Receptor activation occurs in the absence 
of glycine; pharmacologically, rapastinel is a weak modulator 
that enhances NMDAR activity at antidepressant-like concen-
trations and inhibits NMDAR activity at higher concentrations. 
We show here that rapastinel is mechanistically distinct from 
NMDAR antagonists that also show antidepressant proper-
ties. Thus, rapastinel not only has therapeutic potential as 
an antidepressant but also reveals a novel component of the 
mechanistic underpinnings of glutamatergic modulation of 
psychiatric disorders resulting from enhancement of NMDAR 
activation.
