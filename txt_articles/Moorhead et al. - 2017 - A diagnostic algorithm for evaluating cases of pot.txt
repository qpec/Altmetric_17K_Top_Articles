Abstract
Background: The emergence of macrocyclic lactone resistance in canine heartworm poses a substantial threat to
what is currently the only effective, FDA-approved available method of prevention. Further study of the biotypes is
necessary to understand the mechanism of resistance and evaluate novel prevention options. Identifying cases of
drug-resistant infection remains problematic, however, especially when poor compliance and insufficient testing are
concerns. Furthermore, a definitive demonstration of resistance requires experimental infection and treatment,
which is prohibitively costly.
Methods: With the aim of identifying likely cases of macrocyclic lactone-resistant heartworm and preventing their
continued spread, we describe an algorithm for determining the likelihood of drug resistance and appropriate
treatment strategies for each case.
Results: This algorithm relies on the microfilarial suppression test (MFST), which has been used previously as an
efficient and discrete measure of suspected resistance. By standardizing this method in a format that is readily
available to practitioners, it could become possible to preliminarily survey the emergence and spread of resistance.
Conclusion: Heartworm isolates identified through this method can be used in research to better understand
macrocyclic lactone resistance so prevention strategies can be adapted.

Background
The only FDA-approved available method of preventing
the development of adult heartworms (Dirofilaria immitis)
in dogs and cats is the compliant administration of prod-
ucts containing macrocyclic lactone (ML) drugs [1]. These
products are extremely effective against third-stage larvae
(L3) and up to 30-day-old fourth-stage larvae, with a label
efficacy of 100%. Recently, ML resistance in heartworm has
been suspected in clinical cases, as well as documented in
experimental settings [1–4]. Most, if not all, credible cases
of possible ML resistance in heartworm have been
diagnosed in states bordering the lower Mississippi River,
referred to as the Mississippi Delta region.
In Atkins et al. [5], the authors examined 319 lack of
efficacy (LOE) cases from the Mississippi Delta region of
the United States using the Window of Infection tool
(http://www.heartwormedu.com/). The authors concluded
that in 98.7% of the cases there was insufficient product
purchased, or product was being shared between multiple
dogs in the household, suggesting that these cases likely
were due to noncompliance in administration. However, it
should be noted that in some of these cases the lack of
compliance was outside of the window of infection.
Nevertheless, in 1.7% of the cases (5/319), the cause of the
LOE could not be attributed to noncompliance or extenu-
ating circumstances. One possible explanation is that

 these represent cases where heartworms were resistant to
the ML [5].
Currently, no point-of-care clinically applicable tests
for resistance in heartworm are available. Furthermore,
there are no validated laboratory tests for detecting
resistance in heartworm. Thus, definitive diagnosis in
suspected heartworm resistance cases remains impos-
sible in a clinical setting, and the only means presently
available to prove resistance is to perform a controlled
efficacy study in a laboratory environment [2, 3]. Briefly,
one must collect microfilaremic blood from the suspect
case and then feed that blood to mosquitoes. After
14 days the infective L3 are harvested from the mosqui-
toes and injected into a dog. Thirty days later a dose of
ML is administered followed by four, five, or eight
additional monthly doses [2, 3]. If the dog subsequently
becomes antigen-positive, then the conclusion is that the
worms in the suspect case were indeed an ML-resistant
biotype. Clearly, this is an extremely complicated and
expensive procedure, making it useful only for research
purposes. Consequently, not only do we currently lack
the ability to diagnose cases of resistance definitively at
the clinical level, we also are unable to determine the
prevalence and distribution of resistance in heartworm.
Recently, some progress has been made in identifying
genetic markers that may be associated with resistance
[2, 6], however it remains unknown if this work will lead
to a useful diagnostic test.
So what is a veterinarian to do when presented with a
case of suspected resistance?
Lacking a diagnostic test for resistance in heartworm, is
there anything a veterinarian can do when presented
with a case of suspected resistance? One approach is to
use a surrogate measurement for drug efficacy. There
is a substantial body of literature demonstrating rapid
(within 4–6 h) and profound reductions in microfilaria
(MF) levels following microfilaricidal doses of ML in dogs
infected with known ML-susceptible heartworms [7].
Additionally, dogs infected with heartworms usually be-
come amicrofilaremic following several monthly doses of
ML. Thus, one would expect a dog on compliant ML
prophylaxis to be free of MF unless the dog is infected
with a drug-resistant biotype. In contrast, to our know-
ledge, in every case of proven ML resistance the dog was
microfilaremic at the time of diagnosis despite receiving
monthly treatments with ML drugs. These observations
provide an opportunity to develop a clinical test based on
the measurement of MF levels both before and after a
microfilaricidal dose of ML. This test, referred to as the
MFST (microfilarial suppression test), was first proposed
by Geary et al. [7]. Based on historical data indicating
the expectation of a rapid and profound decrease in
levels of MF, Geary (2011) proposed that reductions
in MF of <75% following a microfilaricidal dose of ML are
suggestive of resistance. If reduction in MF numbers
is >75%, the case is unlikely to represent ML resistance.
Methods
Although it is possible that new data might be produced
that contradict this assertion, current evidence suggests
that the MFST is the most practical and accurate
method for determining whether a heartworm case is
ML-resistant. Consequently, veterinary practitioners could
benefit from a diagnostic algorithm for evaluating sus-
pected ML resistance cases; and, in this article, we detail a
decision tree for such evaluation (Fig. 1).
Results
A decision tree for potential cases of ML resistance
Node 1 – Compliance, purchase history, and testing
The evaluation of any case for potential ML resistance
begins with a positive result on a commercially available
heartworm antigen test (Fig. 1). The first question that
must be asked is whether the client is compliant with
ML administration and testing. We cannot verify owner
compliance of ML dosing unless the veterinarian directly
observes the owner administering the drug, or, alterna-
tively, the veterinarian or his/her staff administer each
ML dose. Because verification of owner compliance is dif-
ficult, the veterinarian must inquire as to the consistency
of the client’s ML dosing. Concurrent with this inquiry,
the client’s purchase history must be checked, since gaps
in the purchasing of preventive would indicate a gap in
administration of ML. If ML preventives have not been
administered, there are gaps in administration per the
owner’s history, or there are gaps in the purchase history,
then it is reasonable to assume that the case is not likely
due to an infection with a resistant biotype.
The gaps referred to previously are at least 2 months
in administration of preventive. For smaller gaps, those
less than 2 months, the scenario is different. Specifically,
if the owner missed only one or two doses and was con-
sistently compliant at all other times, then the suspicion
of resistance would be reasonable, especially when the
safety net (ie, reachback) effect is taken into account. The
safety net effect is defined as the time period that an ani-
mal did not receive heartworm preventive but still did not
develop adult heartworms after subsequent administration
of ML preventives [8]. In one study when ivermectin was
administered at the preventive dose for a period of 1 year
starting at 3 or 4 months postinfection with heartworm
larvae, it was 97.7 and 95.1% effective, respectively. When
milbemycin oxime was administered during a similar time
period, the efficacy against 3-month-old worms was
96.8%, whereas efficacy against 4-month-old worms was
41.4% [9]. Similarly, selamectin administered monthly for
1 year was 98.5% effective against 3-month-old worms [8].

 Additionally, there are data indicating that a single dose of
the topical formulation of 2.5% moxidectin and 10% imida-
cloprid combined with doxycycline (10 mg/kg BID for
30 days) will kill 3.5- and 5-month-old worms [10].
These data indicate that, while efficacy against immature
heartworms may vary for the different ML, there is essen-
tially a grace period in which an otherwise compliant
owner could forget to administer a dose of heartworm
preventive without significant risk of that gap leading to
an infection. Consequently, LOE cases where the owner
missed administering only one or two doses are suspicious
for resistance and warrant further investigation.
Along with compliance, the other factor that must
initially be addressed in the evaluation of resistance is
whether there are gaps in heartworm antigen testing.
The animal should be tested prior to the start of admin-
istration of preventive if over 6 months of age to ensure
no infection exists. In the absence of this test, we cannot
determine whether the current positive result was due to
a recent or previous infection. Furthermore, any test
performed within the first 6 months of compliant
prophylaxis offers no insight into the resistance status of
the infection. In either of these situations, the clinician
should have a low index of suspicion that this is a case
of resistance.
For cases where there are marked gaps in either history
or testing, then the suspicion of resistance is low; and one
should proceed with treatment following the American
Heartworm Society (AHS)-recommended protocol, which
uses three doses of melarsomine dihydrochloride, doxy-
cycline and an ML to clear MF and prevent further trans-
mission (www.heartwormsociety.org).
Node 2 – Observation of microfilariae
The current AHS recommendation is to perform an
examination for MF in all heartworm-positive cases. If no
MF are observed, resistance can neither be disproven nor
confirmed. Even if the biotype was ML-resistant, further
transmission of resistant worms is not possible, as there
are no MF for the mosquitoes to ingest. Without MF,

Page 111 of 235
 there is no development of L3 and, hence, no transmis-
sion. Because resistance can neither be confirmed nor re-
futed, one should proceed with the AHS-recommended
treatment protocol.
If MF are observed, then the MF are persisting in the
face of continuous use of ML (even with the minor gaps
as explained previously. It is the experience of the au-
thors, and is noted in other published works, that all
previous cases of confirmed resistance maintained a
microfilaremia even after the administration of ML at
microfilaricidal doses [1, 2]. Because MF are present,
these cases have a high index of suspicion and the MFST
should be performed [7].
Node 3 – The microfilarial suppression test (MFST)
As already stated, presently the MFST is the only patient-
side test that can adequately predict whether an LOE case
has a high or low suspicion of resistance. The three steps
of the MFST are as follows:
1. Perform Knott’s test for quantitation of MF. The
procedure for this test is located at
www.heartwormsociety.org. The entire sample
should be counted in order to gain the number of
MF per milliliter.
2. Administer ivermectin at 50 μg/kg, or milbemycin
oxime at 1 mg/kg, after obtaining blood for the
Knott’s test. It is important to remember that both
medications are microfilaricidal at these doses,
which causes rapid disappearance (ie, within 4–8 h)
of susceptible MF but not of resistant MF. One will
not know whether the MF are susceptible; and,
therefore, these animals should be treated prior to
the administration of ML with diphenhydramine
and steroids in order to prevent anaphylaxis due to
the rapid death of MF (www.heartwormsociety.org).
However, it is important to keep in mind that you
would only perform the MFST in a case where the
owner is providing apparent compliant prophylaxis.
If the infection was acquired prior to the initiation
of prophylaxis, or is due to a break in prophylaxis
rather than due to ML-resistant heartworms, then
there should be no or very few circulating MF,
making the MFST unnecessary and anaphylaxis
highly unlikely. If the biotype is ML-resistant and
the animal has been on compliantly administered
preventive, then presumably the rapid death of MF
will not occur; thus, there is little risk in performing
the MFST. Nevertheless, because of the potential
risk of anaphylaxis, the microfilaricidal doses of
ivermectin or milbemycin oxime should be administered
at the veterinary hospital and the dog observed for
6–8 h post microfilaricide administration.
Topical 2.5% moxidectin and 10% imidacloprid is an
FDA-approved microfilaricide, and the risk of anaphyl-
axis when 2.5% moxidectin and 10% imidacloprid is
administered to a microfilaremic dog is less than iver-
mectin at 50 μg/kg or milbemycin oxime at 1 mg/kg
[11, 12]. However, the use of this product in the MFST
has never been documented in the literature; and, thus,
we lack the data necessary to interpret the results properly
following its use. Consequently, until studies are per-
formed and validate its use, we do not advocate the
use of topical 2.5% moxidectin and 10% imidacloprid
in the MFST.
3. Perform a second Knott’s test for MF quantification
7 days after the initial test. The percentage reduction
in numbers of MF between the first and second
Knott’s tests determines whether the case has a high
or low suspicion of resistance. If there is a > 75%
decrease in MF numbers between the two tests, then
our suspicion of ML resistance will be low. If there
is <75%, then our index of suspicion will be high.
It should be noted, that historically there will be a
90–95% reduction of MF after use of 50 μg/kg of
ivermectin [13]. One could reasonably expect a high
degree of variability in this test, and additional
contemporary experimental data would be desirable.
However, the experiments required to refine this
cutoff would be expensive, requiring a large number
of dogs of different breeds. Since these experiments
will not likely be performed, using published historical
data (ie, 75% decrease) is the most practical approach.
For both high- and low-suspicion cases, one immedi-
ately proceeds with the AHS-recommended adulticide
treatment. It must be emphasized that, at the initiation
of this treatment regimen, doxycycline is administered at
a dose of 10 mg/kg BID for 30 days. This is important
due to the fact that McCall et al. (2014) reported that
MF taken from a dog treated with doxycycline developed
to L3 in mosquitoes, but that those L3 did not subse-
quently develop to adult heartworms when used to in-
fect dogs. In other words, the doxycycline essentially
limited the infectivity of the L3 derived from the heart-
worm-infected dog. In conjunction with doxycycline, it is
also important to consider a topical product that is labeled
to repel mosquitoes. While repellency of mosquitoes is
not a substitute for ML heartworm preventives, a mos-
quito repellent does provide an added layer of protection
that is desirable, especially when dealing with transmission
of a potentially resistant biotype.
Discussion
Realistically, all cases of heartworm should be treated using
melarsomine, preferably following the AHS guidelines. For

 this reason, the question could be asked as to whether
there is a practical utility to applying this algorithm in a
clinical situation. The authors feel that the use of this
diagnostic procedure is important, as it allows us, to the
best or our current scientific capabilities, to determine
which cases are most likely due to resistance and where
they are originating. With these data, we can begin to
evaluate the potential prevalence and geographic distribu-
tion of ML resistance; and veterinarians will be able to
judge whether ML-resistant heartworms are circulating in
their practice area.
Conclusion
In the absence of a test that provides conclusive proof of
resistance, the algorithm presented here represents a vi-
able tool for clinicians to investigate and report resitance
in heartworm cases.
