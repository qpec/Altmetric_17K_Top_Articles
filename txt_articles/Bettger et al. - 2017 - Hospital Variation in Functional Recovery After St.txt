ational organizations and recent policies advocate for 
more patient-centered and outcomes-based indicators of 
good or poor hospital quality.1,2 Functional outcomes, which 
are measured by disability and an individual’s loss of indepen-
dence in activities of daily living, are considered to be among 
the most meaningful patient outcomes. Nevertheless, in the 
United States, functional status is not measured consistently 
outside of postacute rehabilitation services, nor is it assessed 
using a common and comparable measure.3
Stroke is the second leading cause of death and disability 
worldwide and the leading cause of major long-term disability 
among adults in the United States Almost 800 000 Americans 
experience a new or recurrent stroke each year; among these 
patients, there is a higher likelihood of subsequent disability 
than death.4 Although ≤90% of stroke survivors have residual 
impairment, there is limited information on whether patients’ 
downstream functional outcomes vary according to where 
they are initially hospitalized and treated.3 Studies of hos-
pital variation are a first step in understanding the potential 
for quality improvement, with wide variation suggesting that 
care differs across hospitals. Stroke care may be improved by 
studying and disseminating best practices among hospitals 
with more favorable outcomes.
Using data from a prospective national cohort study and 
clinical registry, this study examined whether there was hos-
pital variation in downstream functional status among stroke 
patients. Specifically, we evaluated (1) the overall rates of 
stroke disability and dependence at 3 months, (2) whether 
3-month functional outcomes varied among hospitals, and 
(3) whether specific hospital characteristics were associated 
with better (or worse) functional outcomes after adjusting 
for patient characteristics. Although some hospital variability 
in rates of disability could be expected, the extent to which 
meaningful variation remains after accounting for patient 
Background—Functional status is a key patient-centric outcome, but there are little data on whether functional recovery 
post-stroke varies among hospitals. This study examined the distribution of functional status 3 months after stroke, 
determined whether these outcomes vary among hospitals, and identified hospital characteristics associated with better 
(or worse) functional outcomes.
Methods and Results—Observational analysis of the AVAIL study (Adherence Evaluation After Ischemic Stroke-
Longitudinal) included 2083 ischemic stroke patients enrolled from 82 US hospitals participating in Get With The 
Guidelines-Stroke and AVAIL. The primary outcome was dependence or death at 3 months (modified Rankin Scale 
[mRS] score of 3–6). Secondary outcomes included functional dependence (mRS score of 3–5), disabled (mRS score 
of 2–5), and mRS evaluated as a continuous score. By 3 months post-discharge, 36.5% of patients were functionally 
dependent or dead. Rates of dependence or death varied widely by discharging hospitals (range: 0%–67%). After risk 
adjustment, patients had lower rates of 3-month dependence or death when treated at teaching hospitals (odds ratio, 0.72; 
95% confidence interval, 0.54–0.96) and certified primary stroke centers (odds ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 
0.53–0.91). In contrast, a composite measure of hospital-level adherence to acute stroke care performance metrics, stroke 
volume, and bed size was not associated with downstream patient functional status. Findings were robust across mRS 
end points and sensitivity analyses.
Conclusions—One third of acute ischemic stroke patients were functionally dependent or dead 3 months postacute stroke; 
functional recovery rates varied considerably among hospitals, supporting the need to better determine which care 
processes can maximize functional outcomes.  (Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes. 2017;10:e002391. DOI: 10.1161/

characteristics is unknown. Furthermore, US hospital charac-
teristics have not previously been examined.
Methods
The AVAIL study (Adherence Evaluation After Ischemic Stroke-
Longitudinal) was a prospective national cohort study of outcomes at 
3 and 12 months post-stroke.5 AVAIL was implemented in collabora-
tion with the American Heart Association Get With The Guidelines-
Stroke (GWTG-Stroke) program, which is an ongoing, voluntary, 
hospital registry, and performance improvement initiative for acute 
stroke. All AVAIL-participating hospitals and the study coordinat-
ing and data analysis centers obtained institutional review board 
approval. AVAIL participants gave informed consent for follow-up 
telephone interviews. Outcome Sciences, Inc served as the data col-
lection coordinating center for GWTG. The Duke Clinical Research 
Institute served as the data collection coordinating center and data 
analysis center for AVAIL, as well as the data analysis center for 
GWTG-Stroke.
Population
Personnel at each GWTG-Stroke hospital were trained to ascertain 
consecutive adult patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of stroke. 
Each admission was confirmed through chart review. Additional de-
scriptions of GWTG-Stroke case ascertainment and quality auditing 
have been previously published.5 From 2006 to 2008, study person-
nel at 101 GWTG-Stroke-participating hospitals screened patients 
for AVAIL eligibility during the hospitalization and then obtained 
informed consent. AVAIL excluded patients with hemorrhagic stroke 
or who were expected to survive <6 months (eg, because of advanced 
or metastatic cancer, comfort care, or hospice). Compared with pa-
tients in the GWTG-Stroke-participating hospitals, AVAIL patients 
were more likely to be younger, male, white, and to have a less severe 
stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] interquar-
tile range [IQR], 1–7 versus 1–10).6
Data Collection
The design of GWTG-Stroke and AVAIL has been previously de-
scribed.7,8 Hospitals participating in GWTG-Stroke collected patient-
level data on demographics, diagnostic testing, treatments, and the 
provision of evidence-based care for hospitalized stroke patients. At 
enrollment for AVAIL, consented patients provided personal contact 
information, alternate contacts, and additional sociodemographic and 
medication data. Patients or their designated proxy was contacted by 
telephone 3 and 12 months after hospital discharge. Trained research 
personnel used standard scripts to conduct telephone interviews that 
included primarily standardized assessments.
Among them was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), which is a 
global measure of functional status that provides 6 distinct stages of 
functioning.9 A yes or no response was provided for whether assis-
tance was needed for each mRS level (from 0=no assistance needed 
to 5=required constant care and 6=dead). Although mRS is the most 
common clinical outcome measure for stroke, there is no full con-
sensus on how the scores should be summarized.3,10 The most com-
mon, and this study’s primary outcome, is the mRS dichotomized by 
patients who are functionally dependent or dead (mRS score of 3–6) 
versus those who are not (mRS score of 0–2). By 3-month follow-up, 
3% of the patient sample had died. Secondarily, we examined 4 ad-
ditional end points using the mRS including moderate to severe func-
tional dependence among those who survived 3 months after hospital 
discharge (mRS score of 3–5), survived and considered to be living 
with disability (mRS score of 2–5=unable to carry out all previous ac-
tivities, activity, or worse), and mRS as a continuous variable among 
survivors (scores 0–5) and in the whole sample (scores 0–6).
Analyses
Patient characteristics were examined at the patient level, compar-
ing those dependent or dead versus those not dependent or dead. 
Differences between the 2 groups of patients were tested using χ2 
tests for categorical variables and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for 
continuous variables. The threshold for statistical significance in all 
analyses was α=0.05 at the level of the individual test. No adjustment 
was made for multiple testing.
Hierarchical regression models were used to examine the vari-
ability on outcomes between hospitals and the association between 
hospital characteristics and outcomes, adjusting for other patient 
characteristics. Disabled, dependence, and dependence/death were 
modeled as binary outcomes using logistic regression, and mRS as 
a continuous variable was modeled using linear regression. Although 
mRS data are ordinal, the use of linear models allowed us to quantify 
hospital variation in mean mRS, which is more easily interpreted than 
ordinal model parameters. The distribution of mRS scores for this 
study population is displayed in Figure I in the Data Supplement. A 
normally distributed, random intercept for hospital was included in 
each model. The statistical significance of hospital variation in out-
comes was evaluated by testing for a nonzero random effect variance. 
The hierarchical models were also used to estimate the distribution of 
outcomes across hospitals (for both unadjusted and adjusted figures), 
removing the excess noise because of sampling variation at small 
sites.11 In the case of a continuous outcome, this gives a distribution of 
hospital-specific means; for binary outcomes, this gives a distribution 
of log odds, which was transformed to the probability scale.
Adjustment variables were added to the hierarchical models in 2 
phases. First, hospital variation was analyzed adjusting only for pa-
tient characteristics at the time of presentation and not hospital char-
acteristics or interventions. This model was used to estimate hospital 
random intercepts, after adjustment for covariates. The rationale is 
that we are interested in studying heterogeneity in outcomes that may 
be related to hospital practice patterns. Although it is necessary to ad-
just for differences in case mix, we did not want to adjust for factors 
that may be attributed to hospitals, regions, or systems. Patient char-
acteristics included self-reported sociodemographic factors of age; 
female sex (versus male); white race (versus all else); educational 
attainment of high school or grade school (versus college and high-
er); prestroke vocational status not working because of retirement, 
disability, unemployment, or being a homemaker (versus working); 
WHAT IS KNOWN
• Functional outcomes are considered to be among 
the most meaningful patient outcomes. In the United 
States, functional status is not measured consistently 
outside of postacute rehabilitation services, nor is it 
assessed using a common and comparable measure.
• Stroke is the second leading cause of death and dis-
ability worldwide and a leading cause of major long-
term disability among adults in the United States, 
with almost 800 000 Americans experiencing a new 
or recurrent stroke each year.
• Although ≤90% of stroke survivors have residual 
impairment, there is limited information on whether 
patients’ downstream functional outcomes vary 
according to where they are initially hospitalized 
and treated.
WHAT THE STUDY ADDS
• This study identified significant variation in rates 
of functional dependence across participating hos-
pitals—median hospital-level rate of dependence 
or death was 37% with an adjusted IQR of 32% to 
41%—supporting the need to better determine which 
care processes can maximize patients’ functional 
outcomes after stroke.

and prestroke income perceived to be inadequate (versus adequate). 
Clinical factors included medical history on admission and stroke se-
verity (NIHSS). Hospitals were ranked by their estimated random ef-
fect on dependence or death (adjusted for patient characteristics only) 
and classified into quartiles. For descriptive purposes, patient factors, 
treatments, and hospital characteristics were compared across quar-
tiles of the risk-adjusted rate using the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel 
row mean score test and nonzero correlation test for testing the differ-
ence for categorical and continuous variables, respectively.
The second phase of adding adjustment variables involved adding 
hospital characteristics to the model as fixed effects; their contribu-
tion is reported in terms of odds ratios, or difference in means, along 
with 95% confidence intervals, depending on the type of outcome. 
Hospital characteristics included number of beds, number of isch-
emic stroke discharges annually, Joint Commission primary stroke 
center certification, academic/teaching center, region, and a com-
posite score of acute stroke performance measures. The composite 
score12 was defined as the total number of performance measure in-
terventions performed among eligible patients divided by the total 
number of possible performance measure interventions (acute throm-
bolytic therapy within 3 hours of symptom onset; early antithrombot-
ics; deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis by day 2; and anticoagulation, 
antithrombotics, lipid lower mediation, and smoking cessation inter-
vention) among eligible patients. Analyses were completed using the 
SAS PROC GLIMMIX, COVTEST statement, INDEP option.
NIHSS was missing for 29% of patients in this study. Because 
NIHSS is likely an important factor that influences outcomes,13 analy-
ses were completed using 2 approaches. First, we present findings 
from our hierarchical regression models that used multiple imputation 
to handle the missing NIHSS scores. Point estimates and SEs reflect 
the combined results over 5 imputed data sets. Multiple imputation is 
commonly advocated,14 and the use of imputation allows us to main-
tain a representative sample of patients from every hospital; however, 
the missing data mechanism for NIHSS is poorly understood. For 
comparison, we conducted an analysis restricted to the sample of pa-
tients with a documented NIHSS score (n=1435 and 77 hospitals). In 
total, 10 regression models were fit (dependence or death [mRS score 
of 3–6] and continuous [mRS score of 0–6] including patients who 
died; functional dependence [mRS score of 3–5], functional disabil-
ity [mRS score of 2–5], and continuous [mRS score of 0–5] among 
patients who survived; first in the sample of patients with NIHSS 
imputed and then with documented NIHSS scores). Findings were 
similar among dependent (mRS score of 3–5) and disabled (mRS 
score of 2–5) patients; therefore, disabled patients are not presented. 
Similarly, findings of the complete case analysis (NIHSS completed) 
were similar to the models with NIHSS imputed; as a result, only 
select models were presented for the NIHSS complete sample.
Results
Of the 2271 ischemic stroke patients enrolled in AVAIL, 145 
were excluded because a mRS score was not recorded at 3 
months, and 43 patients were excluded because they were 
treated at hospitals with fewer than 5 AVAIL patients. Our 
final study sample included 2083 ischemic stroke patients 
from 82 hospitals. By 3 months, one third of patients (36.5%) 
were dependent or dead (n=761; mRS score of 3–6), whereas 
up to two thirds of patients had some degree of disability 
(mRS score of ≥2=65.9%). Patient characteristics for those 
dependent or dead versus not dependent or dead are presented 
in Table I in the Data Supplement .
Hospital-Level Variability
Of the 82 hospitals, all but 2 hospitals were in urban locations, 
75.6% were academic or teaching hospitals, 73.2% were Joint 
Commission certified as primary stroke centers at the time of 
the study, and the median number of hospital beds was 403 
(IQR, 317–527). The composite measure of hospital-level 
adherence to acute stroke performance measures was high 
with little variation across participating sites. Fewer hospi-
tals were located in the West United States (13.4%) compared 
with 25.6% in the South, 28.0% in the Northeast, and 32.9% 
in the Midwest.
Figure displays that the likelihood of dependence or death 
varies considerably among hospitals. The estimated median 
hospital-level rate of dependence or death (Figure 1A) was 
37% (unadjusted IQR, 31.2%–41.8%; P<0.001), and the 
adjusted variation was no longer significant (adjusted IQR, 
32.1%–40.8%; P=0.090). The intraclass correlation for the 
unadjusted mRS was 0.034, and adjusted mRS was 0.023. 
There was significant variation of unadjusted (mean mRS 
score of 2.16; SD=0.33; P<0.001) and adjusted (mean mRS 
score of 2.16; SD=0.26; P=0.019) mean mRS across hospitals 
(Figure 1B). We obtained an intraclass correlation for unad-
justed and adjusted mRS as a continuous outcome of 0.041 
and 0.028, respectively. Further adjustment for hospital char-
acteristics demonstrated how the differences in measured hos-
pital characteristics explained a significant proportion of the 
variability between hospitals (mean mRS adjusted for patient 
and hospital characteristics: P=0.231; rate of dependence or 
death adjusted for patient and hospital characteristics: P=571). 
Findings were similar for the rate of dependence and mean 
mRS among survivors and those patients with a NIHSS score 
(Figures II and III in the Data Supplement).
Patient characteristics measured during the hospital stay 
were largely similar across hospital quartiles of risk-adjusted 
3-month dependence or death (Table 1). Nonetheless, patients 
treated at hospitals in the middle quartiles (Q2 and Q3) were 
more likely to be of black race (P<0.001) and unemployed 
because of disability pre-stroke (P<0.001). The use of in-
hospital and discharge treatments was generally similar across 
hospital quartiles, with the exception of lipid-lowering drugs 
which were more common in hospitals with lower rates of 
disability (P=0.02). Patients at hospitals with higher adjusted 
rates of 3-month dependence or death were less likely to be 
discharged to home (P<0.001).
Hospital Characteristics Associated With 
Functional Recovery
At the hospital level (Table 2), the percentage of certified pri-
mary stroke centers decreased with worse hospital ranking on 
dependence or death (85.0%, 76.2%, 76.2%, and 55.0% from 
quartiles 1–4, respectively; P=0.044). A similar trend was 
found for teaching hospitals with the percentage decreasing 
with worse hospital ranking on dependence or death (85.0%, 
85.7%, 66.7%, and 65.0%; P=0.064). Hospital characteristics 
were otherwise fairly similar across hospital quartiles of risk-
adjusted 3-month dependence or death.
Tables 3 and 4 present 3-month functional status as a 
function of hospital characteristics. Stroke patients were 
less likely to be dependent or dead if they received care at a 
teaching hospital (odds ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, 
0.54–0.96) or primary stroke center–certified hospital (odds 
ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.53–0.91; Table 3). 
Compared with the Northeast, patients treated at hospitals in 
the South and Midwest, but not the West, were more likely 
to be dependent or dead at 3 months. Findings were similar

for mean mRS (Table 4) where patients treated at teaching 
hospitals or primary stroke center–certified hospitals had 
better mRS scores (less disability) and at hospitals in the 
South or Midwest had worse mRS scores compared with the 
Northeast.
The same hospital characteristics associated with depen-
dence or death and mean mRS for the full sample (Tables 3 
and 4) were also significant when examined among survi-
vors (Tables II and III in the Data Supplement). Acute stroke 
care in a teaching hospital or primary stroke center–certified 
hospital was associated with decreased likelihood of depen-
dence (Table II in the Data Supplement) and less disability 
(Table III in the Data Supplement), and geographic location 
was associated with the outcome. The complete case analy-
sis including only patients with NIHSS scores was consistent 
with these findings (Tables II and III in the Data Supplement). 
Differences in terms of statistical significance were largely 
reflective of wider confidence intervals for the NIHSS 
Figure. Hospital variation in 3-mo functional status adjusted for patient characteristics. Hospital variation in 3-mo unadjusted and 
adjusted functional status measured as (A) dependence or death (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score of ≥3) and (B) as mean mRS score 
(mRS score of 0–6; n=2083 ischemic stroke patients, 82 hospitals).

complete data. Finally, we found across all models and mRS 
end points that hospital bed size, stroke volume, or the com-
posite score of acute stroke care performance were not associ-
ated with functional recovery.
Discussion
From a patient’s perspective, functional outcomes after stroke 
should be considered as an important indicator of hospital 
performance. Our study is among the first to examine varia-
tion in downstream functional outcomes after acute ischemic 
stroke among treating hospitals. Importantly, we identified 
significant hospital-level variation that persisted even after 
adjusting for patient baseline sociodemographics, clinical 
characteristics, and stroke severity. We also found that patients 
treated at teaching hospitals and primary stroke centers were 
less likely to be functionally dependent at 3 months after

adjusting for patient factors. These conclusions remained 
robust across a variety of analytic perspectives and sensitivity 
analyses. Taken together, these results suggest that the treating 
hospital can influence downstream stroke functional recovery.
Hospital-level variation in functional recovery can be 
attributed to many factors; examinations of hospital-level 
outcomes, including function, need to carefully consider 
adjustment for patient case mix.3,15 After recent recommen-
dations for measuring functional status at the hospital level,3 
we included stroke severity as a key patient characteristic. In 
addition to analyzing the patient sample with complete data, 
we also used multiple imputation for missing NIHSS scores; 
the findings were similar. Findings were also similar across 
mRS end points. There are numerous implications of high 
hospital variability in functional outcomes. First, high vari-
ability suggests that hospitals may play a role in influencing 
long-term functional status—not just survival.16 This role 
may occur through in-hospital interventions and treatment or 
organized care, as well as discharge planning that is support-
ive of care transitions. Second, high variability in functional 
outcomes suggests that some hospitals are not achieving 
optimal functional outcomes. This implication supports the 
use of global measures of function and disability for stroke 
quality improvement initiatives. Given the variability in

 7  Bettger et al  Hospital Variation in Functional Outcomes
functional recovery across hospitals, future research could 
evaluate hospitals that demonstrate exemplary and poor 
recovery among patients to identify additional factors and 
characteristics of stroke care where quality improvement 
efforts could be targeted.
Among the hospital characteristics examined, acute 
stroke care processes as a composite measure of performance 
were not independently associated with functional outcomes. 
This may be in part a result of the composite measure consist-
ing largely of secondary prevention measures. The relation-
ship of these measures with functional recovery is unclear. 
Furthermore, acute stroke care is complex and includes many 
components beyond these performance metrics. For exam-
ple, geography may play a role in availability or access to 
resources, as well as stroke system organization. The varia-
tion by region was not consistent across end points or popula-
tions studied and warrants further examination. In this study, 
primary stroke centers and academic teaching hospitals had 
lower rates of poor functional outcomes. Primary stroke 
center certification may be a proxy for a broader concept of 
quality representing organized stroke care provided by multi-
disciplinary teams. In Canada, organized stroke care reduced 
death and institutionalization at 30 days across age groups.17 
Both primary stroke centers and teaching hospitals may have 
additional resources to support stroke recovery that are not 
captured in the requisite performance metrics and operate 
independent of annual stroke volume and size. Additional 
indicators of hospital quality and optimal stroke care should 
be considered for future studies.
To date, only 1 study has assessed hospital level variably 
in downstream functional outcomes. A study of 10 hospitals 
from the Netherlands also found their composite score of 
acute stroke performance measures (diagnostic, therapeutic, 
and secondary prevention) explained little of the variation in 
dependence or death at 1 year.18 Variation across hospitals in the 
Netherlands (29%–78%) was similar to our study. At a patient 
level, reports of functional dependence at 3 months poststroke 
hospital discharge in our study were similar to cohort stud-
ies from China,19,20 Spain,21 and Japan.22 Importantly, these 
findings of dependence post-stroke in the United States and 
abroad demonstrate the high level of stroke morbidity and the 
need for continued efforts targeting functional recovery.
More than half of stroke patients in the United States are 
not discharged directly to home from the hospital; instead, 
these patients are transferred to short-term inpatient facilities 
that provide rehabilitation and continued medical manage-
ment.23 Rehabilitation services post-stroke aim to improve 
functional status, and research is needed to determine how 
best to adjust for receipt of these services post-discharge 
when evaluating hospital-based performance. Assessment of 
patient-centered outcomes for patients living in the community 
post-stroke is challenging. Functional status is not uniformly 
captured—clinically or administratively. Implementation 
research is urgently needed to examine the feasibility of 
assessing functional status at a predetermined time (ie, 30 or 
90 days) for every patient and to determine the resources and 
process for establishing a standardized measure of functional 
status (including training of assessors) that can be adminis-
tered reliably. The Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care 
Transformation Act is expected to improve postacute patient 
assessment data and quality and address some of the measure-
ment gaps noted above, especially about timing and instru-
ment.24 Yet, although the Improving Medicare Post-Acute 
Care Transformation Act does not extend the requirement for 
patient assessment beyond formal postacute care services, the 
mRS continues to be the most common poststroke outcome 
in clinical trials, population-based research, and requirement 
of Joint Commission Comprehensive Stroke Center certifica-
tion.25 Consequently, further research is warranted to guide the 
field on how to best analyze the mRS as an outcome when 
examining hospital quality.
Our study must be considered in light of several limita-
tions. First, hospitals contributing a small number of patients 
have large uncertainty with respect to outcomes and perfor-
mance metrics; this was handled by random effects modeling. 
However, the random effects for small sites will be shrunken 
more toward the population average and, therefore, are more 
likely to fall in the middle quartiles. Type I error was con-
trolled at the level of the individual test without adjustment 
for multiple testing. Second, although multiple hospital char-
acteristics were significantly related to outcomes, a false posi-
tive is possible. Third, although premorbid disability is known 
to be associated with functional outcomes, a specific measure 
was not a part of this clinical registry and longitudinal study. 
A measure of independence with ambulation before hospital 
admission was available to us; however, these data were miss-
ing for 36% of the sample, and among those with data, 98% 
were independent. Alternatively, we delineated those patients 
who were not working before their stroke because of dis-
ability because our previous work identified these patients to 
be at increased odds of disability and dependence or death 3 
months post-stroke.6 Fourth, although the NIHSS measure of 
stroke severity was available for adjustment, it was missing in 
27% of patients, and the reasons for missingness are poorly 
understood. The use of multiple imputation will address this 
missingness, as long as the relationship between missingness 
and outcome is explained by the measured covariates (miss-
ing at random). Informative missing cannot be ruled out, and 
the potential impact on hospital variation is unknown. Fifth, 
AVAIL-participating hospitals may not be representative of 
the overall US hospital population. All participating hospitals 
were actively engaged in the GWTG-Stroke quality improve-
ment program, whereas hospitals without an organized, data-
driven quality improvement program were not represented. A 
likely consequence is that variation across hospitals may be 
even larger than what we observed. Finally, we were unable 
to adjust for community health indictors and hospital-level 
socioeconomic status, nor were we able to adjust for care 
coordination and posthospital interventions. Such differences 
in care patterns and systems are not confounders, but they are 
important sources of variation.
In conclusion, this study identified significant variation in 
functional status and rates of dependence across participating 
hospitals. These findings support the need to better determine 
which care processes and hospital capabilities can maximize 
patients’ functional outcomes after stroke. Furthermore, our 
study suggests that functional status may be an important out-
come for hospital-level quality reporting.
