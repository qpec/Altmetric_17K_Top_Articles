Abstract
In this repeated measures case study, we show that sensory deafferentation after
limb amputation leads to changes in cortical somatotopic maps which are
reversible after restoration of sensory input. Using magnetoencephalography
(MEG), we observed in a child with bilateral hand transplants large-scale shifts
in somatosensory lip cortical representation from anatomic hand area to ana-
tomic face region. After recovery of tactile sensation in the digits, responses to
finger stimulation were localized to orthotopic sensory cortex, but with atypical
electrophysiologic features (amplitude and frequencies).
Introduction
Loss of peripheral sensory inputs leads to functional reor-
ganization of primary somatosensory cortex.1–3 Following
deafferentation of the upper limb in adult primates, the
area of somatosensory cortex deprived of afferent signals
begins to respond to tactile stimulation of the face, a
massive cortical reorganization (MCR) mediated sub-
cortically
through
the
cuneate
nucleus.4
Similar
demonstrations of MCR have also been reported in
human adults with unilateral upper limb amputations
using MEG.5–7 MCR has not been demonstrated in chil-
dren previously, and the cortical adaptation to restoration
of sensory inputs in children is unknown. We utilized the
spatial and temporal resolution of MEG measurements of
tactile sensory responses to provide insight into the
dynamics of sensory reorganization and to ask, can mas-
sive reorganization of primary somatosensory cortex after

 early-life limb loss revert to a typical somatotopic map after
hand transplantation in a child?
MEG somatosensory responses and index finger touch
sensitivity (using monofilament testing) were recorded
over
the
year
following
transplantation
at
visits:
1
(6 weeks), 2 (18 weeks), 3 (33 weeks), and 4 (54 weeks).
We sought to determine whether (1) MCR of face to
hand area was present during the prerecovery period, (2)
MCR would revert to typical orthotopic somatosensory
locations with recovery of sensory function of the hands,
and (3) somatosensory responses from tactile stimulation
of transplanted fingers differ from age-matched controls.
Methods
The
vascularized
composite
tissue
allotransplantation
(VCA) occurred at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia
(CHOP), six years after bilateral hand and foot amputa-
tion at age two resulting from septic shock.8 Renal trans-
plantation had occurred previously. VCA resulted in
reafferentation of the medial, ulnar, and radial nerves
serving hand somatosensation and motor function. Con-
sultation with the institutional review board determined
that this single case report of data collected in the course
of clinical care of this patient did not require separate
IRB oversight. Consent for publication of these data was,
however, obtained from the patient’s parent. Age-typical
control data were also collected from five children (mean
age 10.2 years; range 9.3 years to 11.4 years) who pro-
vided written informed consent for participation in accor-
dance
with
standards
approved
by
our
institutional
review board (IRB) ethics committee.
Tactile sensation measures
At
each
visit,
tactile
sensation
was
measured
using
Semmes-Weinstein monofilament testing with the patient
blindfolded. The threshold of sensitivity was defined as
the thinnest monofilament which the patient affirmed
feeling in at least three of five trials (with no responses
on false trials) over each of several locations in the ulnar,
median, and radial distributions of each hand. Monofila-
ment scores correspond to the monofilament size (lower
score indicates greater sensitivity). To assess gnosis, digit
identification with eyes open and closed was also assessed
at visits 2, 3, and 4.
Magnetoencephalography
Neuromagnetic
activity
to
tactile
stimulation
was
recorded using a whole-head 275-channel CTF MEG
system (VSM MedTech Ltd) located inside a magneti-
cally
shielded
room.
MEG
signals
were
recorded
continuously (1200 samples/s; 0 to 200 Hz). Three fidu-
cial localization coils were used for coregistration of
MEG data to the patient’s brain MRI. Head position
was recorded continuously to ensure that head move-
ments did not exceed 1 cm over the duration of the
MEG recordings.
Somatosensory stimuli were presented to the right
lower lip (visits 1–4) as well as right and left index fingers
(visits 3 and 4) using pneumatic pulses of compressed air
(30 p.s.i.) delivered via clip-on balloon diaphragms (pulse
duration 35 msec; 0.5sec and 0.7sec random ISI). MEG
data were collected in epochs of �0.1 to 0.3 sec for a
total of 500 trials and filtered using 1–40 Hz band-pass
filter. The tactile “P50m” averaged evoked response was
identified by source latency and orientation and used for
source localization.
Data analysis was performed with Brainstorm (http://
neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm)9). For the computation
of the dSPM distributions, an estimate for the diagonal
noise-covariance matrix was computed using a 100 msec
baseline (�100 to 0 msec). Regularization consistent with
the signal-to-noise ratio of whitened data was applied in
the computation of the minimum norm estimates and
conducted on noise-normalized dSPM using an uncon-
strained source model. The dSPM distributions were
thresholded at 80% of the maximum, with peak locations
used for estimating the time-varying activity of the aver-
age from peak locations.
Time–frequency analysis
Peak locations corresponding to the maximum amplitude
of the “P50m” response were identified for finger and lip
stimulation separately. The location of the peak response
was identified in 3D and manually grown in volume
using a set of 20 vertices corresponding to ~4 cm2 in SI.
Single-trial source waveforms (�100 to 300 msec) were
extracted from peak locations and transformed using
Morlet wavelets, with a central frequency of 1 Hz and a
time resolution of 3sec. Time–frequency responses were
computed and displayed between 1 and 150 Hz over 40
logarithmic frequency bins. Power values per frequency
bin were Z-score normalized using baseline levels (�100
to 0 msec) to obtain absolute magnitude changes with
respect to baseline for each participant.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
Whole-brain MRI including diffusion tensor imaging
(DTI) was conducted on visits 1, 3, and 4 with a 3T Sie-
mens Verio scanner using a 32-channel head coil. We
obtained a 3D magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition
gradient-echo (MPRAGE) scan in axial orientation, with

Results
At visits 1 and 2, index fingertips were insensitive to tac-
tile stimulation with even the largest monofilaments. At
visits 3 and 4, the patient was able to sense light touch
on the fingertips (monofilament size for right index finger
was 4.08 and 3.85, and for the left index finger was 4.17
and 4.08, respectively; normal for age is 2.96).10
Typically, tactile sensation of the lip activates the infer-
olateral portion of the postcentral gyrus (primary sensory
cortex, S1). By contrast, in our patient at visits 1 and 2,
prior to recovery of hand sensation, cortical responses to
tactile lip stimulation appeared in superomedial S1, adja-
cent to the hand knob of motor cortex. Accompanying
this massive spatial reorganization was abnormally pro-
longed latencies of the evoked responses to lip stimulation
(~55 msec; age-typical ~30 msec). At visits 3 and 4, lip
stimulation activated orthotopic lip area of S1, inferolat-
eral to the previously activated hand area, with a shorter,
more age-typical latency (see Fig. 1). The postrecovery
reduction in peak latency was not likely due to structural
changes in white matter as somatosensory tract DTI mea-
sures (fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity) did not
change significantly between pre- and postrecovery time
periods.
Right and left index finger stimulation at visit 3 pro-
duced abnormally strong cortical responses with age-typi-
cal latencies (mean age-typical peak latency ~59 msec),11
localized as expected to the contralateral S1 adjacent to
the anatomic hand knob of motor cortex. Responses at
visit 4 were weaker compared to visit 3, possible indicat-
ing a trend toward normalized responses. MEG testing
did not include digit stimulation during visits 1 and 2
because
of
the
absence
of
sensation
on
clinical
examination.
Time–frequency
analysis
to
reveal
frequency
con-
stituents of the elicited brain activity showed that after
recovery of sensation, cortical somatosensory responses
are not only larger but show atypically strong event-
related
synchrony
(ERS)
at
characteristic
beta
band
(~15–30 Hz) frequencies (Fig. 2, upper panels). Time–
frequency analysis also revealed absence of the poststimu-
lus beta band event-related desynchrony (ERD) typically
observed
following
tactile
stimulation.12
While
speculative, these atypical oscillatory dynamics may reflect
limited higher order processing of the somatosensory
stimuli, as the MEG response measures at time point 4
occurred at a stage of recovery where tactile stimuli were
perceived but finger gnosis remained poor.
Discussion
These results show that MCR occurs after childhood limb
loss, in a pattern similar to observations in adult nonhu-
man primates,13 and is reversible after sensory input is
restored with limb transplantation. This novel observation
of MCR in a child using MEG also revealed novel obser-
vations about the temporal features of cortical responses
to tactile stimulation. In the absence of hand sensation,
lip responses mapped to hand sensory cortex with a
~20 msec delay, and after return of hand sensation after
transplantation, lip responses returned to lip cortex with
a typical latency. These data suggest potential anatomic
mechanisms by which the lip sensory pathway governed
by the trigeminal nerve comes to activate the delayed cor-
tical response in the hand area – a cortical region gov-
erned by a separate dorsal column pathway via the
cuneate nucleus.4 Of note, no residual (i.e., parallel) corti-
cal activity was observed from the finger somatosensory
area for either of the postrecovery stimulations presented
to the lip.
Atypically large somatosensory responses to tactile digit
stimulation have been reported previously in adults who
experienced unilateral upper limb replantation following
amputation.14 The authors speculated that the large-
amplitude responses might be related to the experience of
pain, commonly reported in this adult amputee popula-
tion.
In
our
patient,
atypically
large
somatosensory
responses from transplanted fingers were observed in the
absence of reported spontaneous pain sensations. Future
research with pediatric and adult amputees may help
characterize specific structural and neural correlates of
MCR that likely differ with age and may ultimately pre-
dict both the emergence of pain and the optimal condi-
tions for the successful resumption of somatosensation
following transplantation.

 Figure 1. Top panel shows the age-typical functionally defined locations for tactile responses to right index (“RD2”) and right lower lip
stimulation. The blue trace represents the noise-normalized source waveform from a 10-year-old subject, with the mean peak latency from five
control subjects (age 9–11) represented by the dashed vertical red line (mean peak latency 29.7 msec). As expected,10 the location of the cortical
response to lip stimulation is within lip cortex and inferolateral to the cortical hand area. By contrast, Visit 1 and 2 lip (prerecovery) responses are
observed from superomedial hand area (as expected with MCR) and with a delayed peak latency of ~53 msec (black dashed vertical line) for both
visit 1 and 2. The postrecovery response of somatosensory lip cortical response returned to an orthotopic lip area, and with an age-typical peak
latency of ~30 msec.
