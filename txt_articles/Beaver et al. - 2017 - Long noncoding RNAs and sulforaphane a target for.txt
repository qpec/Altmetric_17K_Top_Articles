Abstract
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as important in cancer development and 
progression. The impact of diet on lncRNA expression is largely unknown. Sulforaphane (SFN), 
obtained from vegetables like broccoli, can prevent and suppress cancer formation. Here we tested

 the hypothesis that SFN attenuates the expression of cancer-associated lncRNAs. We analyzed 
whole genome RNA-sequencing data of normal human prostate epithelial cells and prostate cancer 
cells treated with 15 μM SFN or DMSO. SFN significantly altered expression of ~100 lncRNAs in 
each cell type, and normalized the expression of some lncRNAs that were differentially expressed 
in cancer cells. SFN-mediated alterations in lncRNA expression correlated with genes that regulate 
cell cycle, signal transduction, and metabolism. LINC01116 was functionally investigated because 
it was overexpressed in several cancers, and was transcriptionally repressed after SFN treatment. 
Knockdown of LINC01116 with siRNA decreased proliferation of prostate cancer cells, and 
significantly upregulated several genes including GAPDH (regulates glycolysis), MAP1LC3B2 
(autophagy) and H2AFY (chromatin structure). A 4-fold decrease in the ability of the cancer cells 
to form colonies was found when the LINC01116 gene was disrupted through a CRISPR/CAS9 
method, further supporting an oncogenic function for LINC01116 in PC-3 cells.. We identified a 
novel isoform of LINC01116 and bioinformatically investigated the possibility that LINC01116 
could interact with target genes via ssRNA:dsDNA triplexes. Our data reveal that chemicals from 
the diet can influence the expression of functionally important lncRNAs, and suggest a novel 
mechanism by which SFN may prevent and suppress prostate cancer.

1 Introduction
While it has long been known that thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are 
produced in human cells, only recently have their myriad epigenetic regulatory functions 
come to light. LncRNAs are defined as RNAs longer than 200 nucleotides that do not 
encode proteins [1]. Like mRNAs, lncRNAs can be regulated by transcription factors, 
undergo post-transcriptional processing, form complex secondary and tertiary structures and 
exhibit tissue- and development-specific expression [2, 3]. LncRNAs differ from mRNAs in 
that their primary structures are generally poorly conserved between species and they are 
expressed at very low to moderate levels, relative to mRNAs [2, 3]. While the molecular 
functions of most lncRNAs remain largely unknown, there is growing evidence that 
lncRNAs have functional roles in cell biology and development [4, 5]. Additionally, their 
dysregulation can contribute to multiple disease processes [1]. Mechanistically, lncRNAs 
have been shown to modulate gene expression at the level of transcription by associating 
with DNA and chromatin modifying complexes, thereby mediating alteration of the local 
epigenetic landscape [1, 6]. LncRNAs have also been shown to act as decoys for 
transcription factors [7], regulate protein activity [2, 8], and function as structural 
components in subcellular structures like nuclear paraspeckles [3, 9]. A growing list of 
lncRNAs are being identified as dysregulated in cancer cells, and several studies have shown 
that lncRNAs can contribute to the etiology of diseases like prostate cancer [10–12].
Among men, prostate cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer globally, and is 
the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States [13, 14]. This high

 prevalence translates to a significant societal and financial burden and highlights the great 
need to prevent and suppress prostate cancer formation [14]. Importantly, previous studies 
have shown that increased consumption of cruciferous vegetables reduces the risk of 
developing prostate cancer [15, 16]. When cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli and 
broccoli sprouts, are chopped or chewed, glucoraphanin interacts with the enzyme 
myrosinase, producing the phytochemical sulforaphane (SFN) [16]. SFN has been shown to 
have both chemopreventive and cancer suppressive properties in carcinogen-induced and 
genetic models of cancer including a model of prostate cancer [16, 17]. Importantly, SFN 
also exhibits cancer-specific cytotoxic and anti-proliferative effects in human prostate cells 
[18–20]. Little is known about the interaction of lncRNAs and dietary factors. We 
hypothesized that lncRNAs could be a chemopreventive target of the phytochemical SFN. 
Using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) we determined genome-wide expression levels for 
lncRNAs, and investigated whether these changes have functional importance.
2 Methods
2.1 Culturing and Treatment of Cells
Normal prostate epithelium cells (PREC) were obtained from Lonza (Basel, Switzerland) 
and cultured as recommended (Lonza) [18, 21]. Androgen-dependent (LNCaP) and 
androgen-independent (PC-3) prostate cancer cells were obtained from American Type 
Tissue Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured as previously described [18]. All cells were 
confirmed to be mycoplasma free and have the expected allelic composition (Idexx Radil, 
Columbia, MO). Each cell line was treated at 50–70% confluent with SFN (LKT 
Laboratories, St. Paul, MN) dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at 5 or 15 μM 
concentration, or with an equal volume of DMSO (vehicle control) that was 0.03% of the 
total media volume. Adherent cells were harvested at 6 and 24 hours post-treatment. The 15 
μM concentration of SFN was chosen because ~15 μM of total SFN metabolites has been 
observed in the plasma of mice orally dosed with 20 μmoles of SFN, and prostates have one 
of the highest accumulations of SFN among tissues examined [22]. This concentration is 
achievable from consuming 1 to 2 cups (106 – 212 g) of broccoli sprouts. The three different 
prostate cell lines were used because they represent different states of prostate cancer 
progression and based on previous reports showing SFN-induced HDAC inhibition, cell 
cycle arrest (G1 arrest in LNCaP cells, G2/M in PC-3 cells), and apoptosis in prostate cancer 
cells, but not in normal prostate epithelial cells [18–20].
2.2 RNA Sequencing and LncRNA Identification
Cells were treated in triplicate, and total RNA was isolated and subsequently sequenced on 
an Illumina HiSeq 2000 machine at the Center for Genome Research and Biocomputing core 
facility at Oregon State University as previously described [21]. Sequencing data were 
processed in two separate pipelines. The Tuxedo Suite was used in the first pipeline [23]; 
RNA-seq reads were aligned to the human Illumina iGenome (GRCh37/hg19) using TopHat 
version v2.0.14 with the hg19 iGenome annotation guide and default parameters plus --no-
coverage-search and –no-novel-juncs. TopHat was also run permitting novel junctions for 
purposes of novel transcript assembly. Cufflinks version v2.2.1 was used to assemble 
transcript models and compare these to the reference hg19 iGenome annotation. In the

 second pipeline LncRNA annotations were downloaded from Ensembl.org using Biomart. 
Differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified in the GENE-counter pipeline based on 
the criterion of being significantly altered in the experimental versus control condition (p < 
0.05) according to the NBPSeq software package using default parameters [24]. 
Differentially expressed genes were identified based on the criteria of being significantly 
differentially expressed and exceeding a threshold of 20 normalized reads in at least one 
treatment group. Log2 fold changes that approached infinity were reassigned as 20. The raw 
RNA-seq reads and differential expression data have been previously deposited in NCBI 
Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO Series accession number 
GSE48812 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE48812) [21].
2.3 Quantitative Real-Time PCR
Total RNA was collected from indicated cells using a standard Trizol extraction method 
(Life Technologies). cDNA was synthesized using 1 μg of total RNA and SuperScript III 
First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix (Life Technologies). Real time PCR was done using 
primers that amplify all known transcript isoforms of each gene as a single product of 
expected size, between 140 and 300 bp, with the exception of LINC01116 isoforms where 
the primers where designed to only amplify the designated isoform. Primer sequences were 
as indicated (Supplemental Table 1, all supplemental material is attached in a zip file). 
Reactions were performed using Fast SYBR Green Mastermix (Life Technologies) on 
7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). PCR 
conditions were programmed as follows: 95°C for 20 s, followed by 40 cycles of denaturing 
at 95°C for 1 s, annealing and extension at 58°C for 20 s, followed by a dissociation curve at 
95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 15 s, and 95°C for 15 s. A dilution series of 103, 104, 105, 106, and 
107 copies of template DNA served as internal standard for quantification [25]. Data 
represent the copy number of the gene of interest normalized to the copy number of the 
indicated housekeeping gene. GAPDH was used as a housekeeping gene in SFN 
experiments as previously described [21]. For knockdown experiments β-actin was used as 
housekeeping due to consistent expression in all knockdown conditions.
2.4 Guilt By Association
In order to form hypotheses about the function of the identified lncRNAs, we performed a 
correlation-based, guilt-by-association analysis to identify significantly associated pathways. 
Each of the putative SFN-repressed and cancer-associated lncRNAs was investigated by 
identifying significantly correlated and anti-correlated genes. Each set of significantly 
correlated genes was compared to gene subsets annotated in Reactome pathway terms 
downloaded from mSigDB (CP:Reactome). Significant overlap between correlated gene sets 
and Reactome pathways were identified by computing a hypergeometric p-value for each set 
of correlated genes followed by a Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to compute false 
discovery rate (FDR). We imposed an FDR threshold of 0.05. Significantly associated 
pathways are represented in a heat map where 6 out of the 7 lncRNAs of interest showed 
significant association with pathways that are plausibly relevant to cancer.

 2.5 Manipulation of LINC01116 Expression
Growing PC-3 cells were transfected with siRNA or plasmids with the TransIT-X2 reagent 
(Mirus, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer’s protocol. For LINC01116 knockdown 
custom Silencer Select siRNA for LINC01116 was designed, synthesized (Ambion), and 
transfected into cells using the standard manufactures protocol. Knockdown of LINC01116 
RNA was validated 48 h post transfection. The effect of knockdown on PC-3 cell death and 
proliferation was quantified using trypan blue and a hemocytometer as previous described 
[26]. The CRISPR/CAS9 system was utilized to knock out or mutate the LINC01116 gene. 
Cells were transfected with a plasmid (DNA 2.0, Menlo, CA) that encoded GFP, Nickase 
Cas9 protein, and two guide RNAs that targeted DNA mutations specifically to the 
LINC01116 promoter region just upstream of isoform 2 and 3, and in the first exon of 
isoform 1. Alternatively, negative control cells were transfected with the same plasmid 
except the guide RNAs targeted DNA mutations to a region of DNA on chromosome 13 
where no genes are present. Twenty-four hours following transfection, cell sorting was 
performed on a MoFlo XDP cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Inc.). Fluorescence was excited 
using a blue (488 nm) laser; cells were identified in a bivariate scatter plot gated to exclude 
debris. Cells exhibiting the highest fluorescence intensity in the green channel (510–550 nm) 
were sorted, using purify mode and a drop envelope of 1, either into 12 × 75 mm culture 
tubes or 96-well plates on a CyCLONE robotic collector. Cells were verified to be GFP 
positive and immediately reseeded at 10,000 cells per 25 cm2 flask and cultured for 15 days 
to determine clonogenic survival where colonies of more than 60 cells were counted. Cell 
lines were generated through standard culturing techniques from single cells contained in the 
96 well plates. Negative control and possible LINC01116 mutant cell lines were assessed for 
expression of LINC01116 RNA (as described above). PCR was also performed using 
standard protocols and 5′-GTTCAAGTGCGTCCGGGTTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-
CGGACTTCTTTTCCAGGCGG-3′ (reverse) primers, which flank the DNA sequence 
around the location where CAS9 protein acted in the LINC01116 gene.
2.6 LINC01116 Correlation Analysis
We used custom Perl and R scripts to compute Pearson’s correlation values between each 
LINC01116 isoform and all transcripts in the human transcriptome, or between the 
LINC01116 gene and all genes in the genome, using FPKM expression values reported by 
Cuffdiff version 2.2.1 [27]. P-values were calculated from the Z-score of the Pearson’s 
correlation values using a two-tailed test. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to 
compute q-values and control the false discovery rate (FDR). Positive or negative 
correlations between genes/transcripts and LINC01116 or one of its isoforms at FDR 0.05 
were considered to be significant.
2.7 RNA Structure Prediction
Minimum free energy secondary structures were predicted using RNAfold version 2.1.9 with 
no isolated base pairs, and with dangling energies on both sides of a helix in any case (-d 1). 
Base pair probabilities were color coded using relplot.pl which is part of the Vienna RNA 
package (version 2.1.9) [28]

 2.8 Identification of Putative LINC01116 Regulatory Targets
To identify putative regulatory targets for LINC01116 transcripts, we assessed capacity for 
ssRNA:dsDNA triplex formation between each LINC01116 transcript and the promoters of 
all anti-correlated transcripts, where promoters were defined as 2 or 4 kb of DNA centered at 
the transcription start site. Potential for triplex formation was computed with Triplexator 
using the option –fr off with a permitted error rate of 8 percent and a minimum length 
requirement of 14 bases [29]. Although we ran without filtering repeats, none of the 
identified TFOs were repetitive.
3 Results
3.1 Effects of SFN treatment on lncRNA expression in human prostate cell lines
In order to investigate lncRNAs in the context of prostate cancer and SFN we mined 
previously published RNA-seq datasets [21]. We first used GENE-counter to identify 
putative lncRNAs that are differentially expressed, as a factor of cell type (normal versus 
prostate cancer). Pairwise comparisons were made between normal and cancerous cell lines 
treated with the vehicle control (DMSO). Between 257 and 407 lncRNAs were significantly 
differentially expressed in androgen-dependent LNCaP and androgen-independent PC-3 
cells as compared to normal PREC cells (designated here and in the text as cancer effect, 
Fig. 1A–B and Supplemental Table 2, all supplemental material is attached in a zip file). 
Secondly, to determine the extent to which expression of lncRNAs is altered by SFN 
treatment in prostate cells, pairwise comparisons were also made within each cell line and 
time point between the SFN and vehicle control treatments. An average of 119 lncRNAs 
were significantly altered by SFN treatment in each prostate cell line at each time point (Fig. 
1A and 1B, and Supplemental Table 3).
Comparisons of transcript expression in prostate cancer cells versus normal cells showed 
that the majority of differentially expressed lncRNAs (75.8%) were significantly upregulated 
in LNCaP and PC-3 prostate cancer cells as compared to normal cells (Fig. 1C–D). In 
contrast, the majority (64.5%) of lncRNAs significantly differentially expressed after SFN 
treatment decreased in expression. This trend was consistently observed, with the exception 
of 24h LNCaP cells, and shows that the majority of lncRNAs altered by SFN treatment 
undergo a decrease in gene expression (Fig 1C–D). A comparison of the cancer effect and 
SFN effect frequency plots shows that the extent of changes in lncRNA expression (i.e. log2 
fold change) was more modest between SFN treatment and control than between normal and 
cancer cell lines (Fig. 1E–F). Taken together, these results show that lncRNA expression is 
altered in prostate cancer cells and that lncRNA expression can be altered by SFN treatment.
Venn diagrams were generated to evaluate how many lncRNAs were altered by SFN 
treatment in all three cell types. The majority of lncRNAs whose expression was altered with 
SFN were specific to each cell line (Figure 2A). This differential lncRNA expression was 
expected because we have observed a differential cellular response to SFN treatment in the 
same prostate cell lines [18, 21]. The effect of SFN on lncRNA expression is also dynamic 
over time, as the proportion of lncRNAs with SFN-induced changes in expression at both

 time points only exceeded 50% for one of the six conditions tested (Figure 2B and data not 
shown).
To determine which lncRNAs may contribute to chemopreventive effects of SFN, we next 
identified the set of lncRNAs that were significantly upregulated in cancer cells compared to 
control PRECs, and significantly downregulated by SFN treatment in the same cancer cell 
type (Figure 2C). We also identified the set of lncRNAs that were downregulated in cancer 
cells compared to PRECs, and increased by SFN in the same cancer cell type. While there 
was significant overlap between these lncRNA sets, SFN was more likely to attenuate a 
cancer effect if the lncRNA was increased in the cancer cell line and decreased by SFN 
treatment (Figure 2C). The lncRNAs with prostate-cancer-associated expression changes 
that were also mitigated by SFN treatment were considered for further analysis. A subset of 
these lincRNAs were verified by qPCR to independently verify the SFN effect on lncRNA 
expression (Figure 3) and their gene expression in the RNA-seq data set was graphed 
(Supplemental Figure 1). Positive controls Malat1 and Neat1 were upregulated in cancer 
cells relative to PRECs. The abundance and significant changes in expression of our short 
list of lncRNAs of interest are shown (Supplemental Figure 1).
Among all the lncRNAs and conditions examined by qPCR, ~86% of the tests confirmed 
results identified by RNA-seq (Figure 3). RP11-57A19.2 was overexpressed in LNCaP cells 
and its expression decreased by 6 and 24-hour after treatment with SFN (Figure 3A). 
LINC01351 (also called RP11-547I7.2) was overexpressed in LNCaP cells and decreased 
with SFN treatment at both 6 and 24-hour time points (Figure 3B). LINC00883 (also called 
RP11-446H18.3) was overexpressed in LNCaP cells and decreased with SFN treatment in 
PREC, LNCaP and PC-3 cells (Supplemental Figure 1 and Figure 3D). RP11-700H6.1 was 
overexpressed in LNCaP cells and decreased by SFN at the 6h time point (Figure 3E). 
MIR22HG (also called C17orf91) was suppressed in both LNCaP and PC-3 cells, and 
increased by SFN treatment in PREC, LNCaP and PC-3 cells (Supplemental Figure 1 and 
Figure 3C and F). KB-1732A1.1 was overexpressed in PC-3 cells and decreased by SFN in 
PrEc and PC-3 cells (Supplemental figure 1 and Figure 3G). LINC01059 (also called 
AP000783.2) was overexpressed in PC-3 cells and decreased by SFN treatment in PC-3 cells 
(Supplemental Figure 1 and Figure 3H). LINC01116 (also called AC017048.3) was 
overexpressed in PC-3 cells and decreased in PREC and PC-3 cells with SFN (Supplemental 
Figure 1 and Figure 3I). We also confirmed that expression of a subset of lncRNAs was 
significantly altered with a lower concentration of SFN (5 μM SFN, Supplemental Figure 2). 
With the lower dose in SFN the fold change in lncRNA expression was smaller, but the 
SFN-induced change in expression was significantly altered in at least one time point 
examined, and was altered in the same direction (up- or down-regulated) as was found with 
15 μM SFN.
To investigate possible links between these lncRNAs and cancer, we performed guilt-by-
association analysis; after identifying the genes strongly correlated or anticorrelated with our 
lncRNAs of interest based on their expression in the RNA-seq dataset, we then cross-
referenced these gene lists with Reactome pathways. This analysis revealed that most of the 
lncRNAs on our short list were associated with metabolism, gene expression, disease, signal 
transduction, and the immune system (Supplemental Figure 3). In addition, some of the

 lncRNAs were associated with cell cycle, developmental biology, extracellular matrix 
organization and cell-cell communication, which are highly relevant to the etiology of 
cancer.
3.2 Role of LINC01116 in an aggressive prostate cancer cell line
In order to address the functional importance of the lncRNAs, we manipulated the 
expression of the lncRNAs in cancer cells. Suppression of LINC01116 produced the 
strongest phenotype (Figure 4A). ENCODE also showed that LINC01116 has high levels of 
histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27Ac) in its first exon and transcription factors 
previously implicated in cancer (E2F1, RAD21, EGR1 and MYC) have been found near the 
transcription start; these are additional lines of evidence that LINC01116 is transcribed and 
may be regulated by transcription factors that are often dysregulated in cancer. For these 
reasons we pursued LINC01116 to determine if it is functionally significant in PC-3 cells. 
Using siRNA and transient transfections we knocked down LINC01116 expression by 60–
70% (Figure 4B). This knockdown did not affect the number of cells that stained positive for 
trypan blue, a dye that indicates cell death, but it significantly decreased proliferation of 
PC-3 cells (Figure 4C and D). To independently verify this pro-proliferative role of 
LINC01116, we attempted to knockout LINC01116 in PC-3 cells using the CRISPR/CAS9 
system. Cells were transfected with a plasmid that encoded GFP, Nickase Cas9 protein, and 
two guide RNAs that together were designed to cause base substitutions to the promoter and 
first exon of LINC01116 to disrupt gene expression. Over three experiments, we tried to 
generate LINC01116 knockout cell lines from over 4,320 GFP positive PC-3 cells. Survival 
and proliferation were severely impaired in these cells, and no surviving cell lines had a 
complete LINC01116 knockout. One cell line was generated that contained a heterozygous 
mutation for LINC01116, which consisted of a 23 base pair insertion, confirming that the 
CRISPR system mutated the DNA at the LINC01116 loci (Figure 4E). As a positive control 
we generated an Nrf2 mutant using the same technology (Supplemental Figure 4). Since we 
could not create a LINC01116 knockout cell line, we next sought to determine if mutation of 
LINC01116 in PC-3 cells would alter the potential of the cancer cells to form colonies. PC-3 
cells transfected with the plasmid engineered to cause disruption of LINC01116 expression 
caused a significant 5-fold reduction in clonogenic survival (Figure 4F).
LncRNAs have been shown to regulate expression of target genes through multiple 
mechanisms. To learn more about the possible functions of LINC01116, we used our RNA-
seq data to identify genes whose expression patterns anti-correlated with the expression 
patterns of LINC01116 (Supplemental Table 4). These gene lists contained 
Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (GAPDH), Microtubule-Associated Protein 1 
Light Chain 3 Beta 2 (MAP1LC3B2), Beclin 1, Autophagy Related (BECN1), H2A Histone 
Family, Member Y (H2AFY), and Ubiquitin A-52 Residue Ribosomal Protein Fusion 
Product 1 (UBA52) which have been previously linked to glycolysis, autophagy, regulation 
of chromatin structure and ubiquitination respectively. To determine whether LINC01116 
levels may be causally related to the expression of these genes, we evaluated their expression 
in PC-3 cells where LINC01116 was knocked down with siRNA (Figure 4B). Knockdown 
of LINC01116 consistently resulted in a significant increase in GAPDH, MAP1LC3B2, 
H2AFY and UBA52 expression at the mRNA level (Figure 5). BECN1 mRNA was also

 upregulated with LINC01116 suppression but this change was only significant with one of 
the siRNAs tested.
To further characterize LINC01116, we next evaluated its gene structure. The hg19 and hg38 
genome annotations list two isoforms for this gene (Figure 6A, Isoforms 1 and 2). 
Visualization in Gbrowse of the density of mapped reads around LINC01116 indicated the 
existence of an alternate, unannotated isoform. The predominate abundance of this third 
isoform was supported by TopHat and Cufflinks analysis in all three cell lines tested (Figure 
6A and B). We also independently verified the expression of all three isoforms by qPCR 
using primers that were specific to only one or two different isoforms (Figure 6B). Isoform 3 
of LINC01116 was confirmed to be the most abundant in PC-3 cells, followed by isoform 1 
and then isoform 2. We predicted secondary structures for each LINC01116 isoform using 
RNAfold from the Vienna RNA package (Figure 6D) [28]. Isoform 1 and 3 were both 
predicted to have some areas with lower probability of base pairing while isoform 2 was 
predicted to form a long hairpin with a high probability of base pairing.
Several lncRNAs have previously been reported to regulate gene expression via a tethering 
mechanism, wherein the lncRNA interacts with the promoter DNA of a target gene through 
an ssRNA:dsDNA triple helix (triplex) and physically recruits histone modifying enzymes 
such as Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 to mediate chromatin remodeling. Such examples 
include MEG3 [30], Fendrr [31], Khps1 [32], and PARTICLE [33]. To explore a possible 
mechanism for LINC01116, we used the program Triplexator to evaluate the potential of the 
lncRNA in forming a triplex. Six distinct triplex-forming oligonucleotide regions (TFOs) 
were predicted among the LINC01116 isoforms (Figure 6A, orange squares, and Table 1). 
Isoform 1 had the highest number of predicted TFOs, followed by isoform 3 and then 
isoform 2. These TFOs ranged from 15 to 29 nucleotides in length.
To gain insights into the possible biological role of LINC01116, we next sought to 
computationally identify putative direct regulatory targets. Ideal candidates were defined as 
genes whose expression levels significantly anti-correlated with LINC01116 and having at 
least one transcript capable of forming a triplex with LINC01116 isoform 1 or 3 within 1 kb 
of the transcript’s transcription start site (isoform 2 was excluded from this analysis due to 
its low abundance). Using Triplexator, 189 such transcripts were found to possess putative 
triplex target sites (TTSs) in their promoters corresponding to a predicted TFO from 
LINC01116 isoform 1 (Supplemental Table 5), while only 3 anti-correlated genes had TTSs 
corresponding to an isoform 3 TFO (Supplemental Table 6). For this reason, we expanded 
this search up to +/− 2 kb from the transcription start site. In this case 21 different genes are 
predicted targets of LINC01116 isoform 3 (Supplemental Table 7). All together, these gene 
lists contained several genes relevant to cancer, including CNBP, MAP2K3, ANAPC16, 
RAD50. They also contained BECN1 and GAPDH, which we found in this study to be 
upregulated after LINC01116 knockdown (Figure 5).
4 Discussion
The field of lncRNAs is evolving, with a growing number of lncRNAs being identified, 
while their functions remain largely enigmatic [34]. In particular, very little is known about

 the relationship between lncRNAs and dietary factors. Here we show that lncRNA 
expression can be altered by treatment with SFN, a phytochemical derived from the diet. 
When we examined SFN’s effect on lncRNAs we found that the majority of the lncRNAs 
that were significantly altered with SFN were decreased in expression. SFN’s effect on 
lncRNAs was generally cell-specific and dynamic over time; this trend was also observed for 
mRNAs differentially expressed in the same prostate cells after SFN treatment [21]. It is 
important to note that we expected SFN treatment to produce distinct lncRNA profiles in 
each of the cell types because they represent various states of cancer progression, and the 
SFN treatment produces different cellular endpoints ranging from no visible change in 
normal cells, to apoptosis in advanced prostate cancer cells [18, 35, 36]. Because the cellular 
response to SFN is diverse, the differences in SFN-induced changes in lncRNA expression 
between the cell types are interesting and may contribute to the phenotypes observed. Future 
work could determine whether the selective induction of a pro-apoptotic response in PC-3 
cells is dependent on any of the lncRNAs that are only significantly changed with SFN in 
this cell type.
There are a few examples of dietary impacts on lncRNA expression. Several reports 
explored how different dietary patterns alter the expression of the lncRNA H19, which 
regulates growth and cell proliferation [37–39]. Also, Li et. al. showed changes in the 
lncRNA expression profiles of the kidneys in the progeny of mothers were fed a low protein 
diet [40]. Five lncRNAs were shown to be differentially expressed in a rat model of 
hypertension that involved a high salt diet [41], andan independent study examined the 
expression of the lncRNA sONE and eNOS in relation to high salt diets and hypertension 
[42]. Knockout of the gene that encodes the lncRNA SRA in mice conferred resistance to 
high fat diet-induced obesity [43]. While this result was complicated by the fact that SRA 
also codes for a protein, ithighlights the exciting potential of lncRNAs in diet-based 
research. Taken together, this literature and our own study begin to paint a picture of the 
important and previously unappreciated role of lncRNAs in the body’s response to diet.
Several studies have demonstrated that lncRNAs are involved in the development and 
progression of multiple types of cancers, including prostate cancer [10–12]. These 
discoveries illustrate that lncRNAs can play important roles in cancer development and may 
be useful targets for cancer prevention, detection, and treatment. While it was not the focus 
of our study, we did confirm that hundreds of lncRNAs were differentially expressed in 
prostate cancer cells compared to normal prostate cells. Given SFN’s cancer 
chemopreventive properties, one of our goals was to understand whether lncRNAs 
dysregulated in cancer could be good targets for cancer prevention or suppression in 
response to SFN. In exploring this possibility, we identified eight lncRNAs for which SFN 
treatment mitigated the prostate cancer associated dysregulation of expression: 
RP11-57A19.2, LINC01351, LINC00883, RP11-700H6.1, Mir22HG, KB-1732A1.1, 
LINC01059, and LINC01116.. While each of the lncRNAs are worthy of continued 
investigation, it is worth noting that expression of both LINC00883 and MIR22HG was 
significantly altered by SFN in all three cell types. Furthermore, examination of the EMBLI-
EBI expression atlas showed that LINC00883 is expressed in various types of cancers and 
MIR22HG was significantly downregulated in several cancer studies including prostate and 
lung cancer [44]. Interestingly, NRF2 has been associated with MIR22HG in a chromatin

 immunoprecipitation study and thus MIR22HG is likely regulated by this transcription 
factor [45]. NRF2 is a well-known transcription factor that has long been implicated in 
SFN’s chemopreventive properties [46, 47]. The expression atlas also revealed that 
KB-1732A1.1 was expressed in various types of cancers but little is known about its 
differential expression compared to normal cells, and little is known about LINC01059 [44]. 
In comparison, RP11-700H6.1 was expressed in prostate, breast, stomach, and lung cancers, 
as well as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and RP11-57A19.2 was detected in several 
different types of cancer cells including prostate adenocarcinoma, lung carcinoma, and colon 
carcinoma [44]. LINC01351 and LINC01116 are also of particular interest because they 
were overexpressed in our prostate cancer cells relative to normal cells, and mining of the 
database revealed that LINC01351 was significantly increased in pituitary cancer and 
adenocarcinomas of the lung. LINC01116 was upregulated in several previous cancer 
studies including glioblastomas, and lung, colon and prostate cancer [44].
Because suppression of LINC01116 with siRNA produced the strongest phenotype in our 
cancer cell lines, we focused on this gene for further experiments investigating its functional 
importance in prostate cancer cells. We showed that LINC01116 promotes the growth of the 
aggressive prostate cancer cell line PC-3. Our multiple attempts to generate a LINC01116 
knockout cell line were unsuccessful; however, this negative result suggests that LINC01116 
may be essential for PC-3 cell survival. Knockdown of LINC01116 expression was 
associated with the upregulation of genes that significantly anti-correlated with it in prostate 
cells, including GAPDH, MAP1LC3B2, and H2AFY. This result supports a role for the 
lncRNA in prostate cancer wherein it contributes to suppression of key genes known to 
regulate glycolysis, autophagy, and chromatin structure [48–50]. However, it is important to 
note that knockdown of LINC01116 did not phenocopy SFN exposure; for example, its 
knockdown produced a strong increase in GAPDH expression, which we did not observe 
with SFN treatment.
Here we describe a new and abundant isoform for LINC01116. We also show isoform 2 is 
expressed at a much lower level than the othersand has a long and stable hairpin structure, 
suggesting the possibility of dsRNA degrading RNase III enzymes as a cause for its reduced 
expression [51]. It is possible that LINC01116 functions to repress target gene expression, 
and that this may occur via a mechanism involving formation of ssRNA:dsDNA triplexes 
between a LINC01116 TFO and gene promoter DNA. This potential epigenetic mechanism 
would be in keeping with previously identified effects of SFN on epigenetics including 
altered histone acetylation and DNA methylation [18, 52–57]. While extensive future 
experiments are needed to determine whether any of our predicted target genes are directly 
regulated by LINC01116 in vivo, GAPDH and BECN1 are promising targets because they 
are significantly anti-correlated with LINC01116, their promoters possess triplex target sites 
corresponding to a putative LINC01116 TFO, and they are upregulated when LINC01116 is 
knocked down by siRNA.
In conclusion, we established that the lncRNA LINC01116 is upregulated in a human 
prostate cancer cell line, is decreased by SFN treatment, and promotes cell proliferation in a 
human cancer cell line. We also identified a novel isoform of LINC01116 and suggested a 
mechanism of action. Finally, we presented data that support SFN as a promising dietary

 anti-cancer agent and indicate that it may exert its chemopreventive effects through multiple 
mechanisms, including regulation of lncRNA expression. More broadly, our data reinforce 
the idea that lncRNAs are an exciting new avenue for chemoprevention research, and 
chemicals derived from diet can alter their expression.

 Figure 1. Genome-wide effects of cancer and SFN on lncRNA expression
The cancer effect was determined by comparing the lncRNA levels found in LNCaP and 
PC-3 cells compared to normal PREC cells. The SFN effect was determined in each of the 
three cell lines by direct comparison of lncRNA levels of samples treated with 15 μM SFN 
compared to their respective vehicle control at the same time point. A–B) Bars represent the 
number of lncRNAs that were significantly altered by prostate cancer development or by 
SFN treatment at the 6 or 24-hour time points. C–D) Data represent the percentage of 
lncRNAs that had a significant increase (white), or decrease in expression (grey) at the C) 6 
h and D) 24 h time points. E–F) Frequency plots of the amplitude of change in lncRNA 
expression, expressed as log2-fold, which was significantly altered under the indicated 
comparisons. Data are from the 6-hour time point although similar log2 fold distributions 
were also observed at the 24-hour time point (data not shown).

 Figure 2. Comparison of SFN-induced changes in lncRNA expression in normal prostate 
epithelial cells and prostate cancer cells
Venn diagrams showing the number and overlap of A) the lncRNAs whose expression levels 
were significantly altered in PREC, LNCaP, and PC-3 cells with 24 hours SFN treatment. B) 
Venn diagrams showing the number and overlap of lncRNAs in LNCaP cells that were 
significantly increased or decreased with either 6 or 24-hour treatment of SFN. C) lncRNAs 
that were either significantly increased or decreased in expression in LNCaP cells, relative to 
normal cells, and significantly altered by SFN in the opposing direction in LNCaP cells at 
the 24-hour time point. A–C) Data are from a single condition (ie. time point or cell line) but 
similar plots were observed at the A) 6 h time point, B) with PREC and PC-3 cell lines, and 
C) PC-3 cells (data not shown).

 Figure 3. Validation of SFN’s capacity to normalize the expression of lncRNAs that were 
differentially expressed in prostate cancer cells
LNCaP and PC-3 cells were treated with 15 μM SFN or vehicle control (DMSO) for 6 or 24 
hours, and qPCR was performed. Bars are representative of the mean expression levels of 
the indicated lncRNA normalized to GAPDH and expressed relative to the mean expression 
levels in cells treated with DMSO. Samples were collected in at least triplicate, in two 
independent experiments (n=6–7) and stars indicates significant differences between the 
control and treatment groups as calculated by an unpaired, two-tailed t test where * p < 0.05, 
** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.

 Figure 4. LINC01116 enhances proliferation and clonogenic survival in PC-3 cells
A–D) PC-3 prostate cancer cells were transfected with negative control siRNA or two 
different siRNAs to knock down LINC01116, and assayed 48 hours post transfection for (A) 
cellular appearance (10x magnification), (B) LINC01116 expression levels, (C) number of 
cells staining positive for trypan blue, and (D) number of viable cells as an indicator of cell 
proliferation. B–D) Data represent an average of at least 10 replicates that were obtained 
from at least 3 independent experiments. E–F) PC-3 cells were transfected with GFP labeled 
CRISPR/CAS9 plasmids designed to create mutations in the LINC01116 gene (in the 
LINC01116 promoter/first exon), or a negative control plasmid that was designed to mutate

 DNA in a region with no genes (Intergenic). GFP positive cells were sorted and (E) cell lines 
were generated from single cells or (D) clonogenic survival was completed. E) 
Representative DNA gel obtained from a PCR with DNA isolated from indicated cell lines 
and primers that flanked the location where the CAS9 nickase enzyme was directed to create 
mutations. Sanger sequencing confirmed the bands are PCR products from LINC01116 and 
the larger band in the LINC01116 well was LINC01116 sequence with a 23 bp insertion. B–
D, F) Bars are indicative of the mean ± SEM and **, and *** indicates significant 
differences between the control and treatment group as calculated by an unpaired, two-tailed 
t test, where p < 0.01 and p <0.001 respectively.

 Figure 5. Knockdown of LINC01116 significantly increases expression of genes that anti-
correlate with LINC01116
PC-3 prostate cancer cells were transfected with negative control siRNA or two different 
siRNAs to knock down LINC01116 expression. qPCR was performed from RNA collected 
48 hours post-transfection. Bars are representative of the mean expression levels of the 
indicated gene normalized to β-actin and expressed relative to the mean expression levels in 
cells treated with negative control siRNA. Data represent 6–14 individual samples obtained 
from at least 2 independent experiments. Stars indicate significant differences between the 
control and treatment groups as calculated by an unpaired, two-tailed t test where * p < 0.05, 
** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.

 Figure 6. LINC01116 structure and identification of novel isoform
A) Schematic of the three spliced LINC01116 isoforms with exons (blue) and predicted 
triplex forming oligonucleotide (TFO) regions (orange). B) Line graph indicates the mean 
expression levels of each isoform of LINC01116 in PrEC and PC-3 cells, treated with 15 μM 
SFN or vehicle control (DMSO), as determined by RNA-Seq. Expression is calculated as 
Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM). C) qPCR results 
obtained with primers specific to the indicated isoform or isoforms, and RNA from PC-3 
cells. Bars are representative of the mean expression levels of the indicated isoforms, relative 
to a standard curve of known quantity, and normalized to β-actin (n=6). D) Predicted 
secondary structures of each LINC01116 isoform.
