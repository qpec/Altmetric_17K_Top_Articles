Abstract
Background: Topical administration of PR022, 0.05% hypochlorous acid (HOCl) in gel has been demonstrated to be
beneficial in a chronic murine atopic dermatitis model. In a follow up study we tested a higher concentration (0.1%) of
PR022 HOCl gel in comparison to the Janus kinase inhibitor tofacitinib, both of which are currently in clinical phase
studies for treatment of human atopic dermatitis.
Methods: The effect of topically administered HOCl (0.1%) in gel was compared to a topical formulation of tofacitinib
(0.5%) in a therapeutic setting on atopic dermatitis-like lesions in NC/Nga mice as well as itch behaviour. NC/Nga mice
were sensitized with house dust mite allergen. After reaching visible lesions, mice were treated either topically with
HOCl or tofacitinib or gel vehicle for 17 days. After termination of the study, dorsal root ganglia were isolated for ex
vivo stimulation and skin samples were taken for cytokine determination in inflamed skin.
Results: When administered onto lesional skin of NC/Nga mice, both HOCl and tofacitinib reduced lesions and
scratching behaviour. The reduced inflammatory response by HOCl and tofacitinib treatment was demonstrated by
diminished inflammatory cytokines in affected skin tissue from NC/Nga mice. Dorsal root ganglia neurons re-stimulated
with a range of mediators of itch showed a reduced response compared to the vehicle control mice, when isolated
from tofacitinib or HOCl treated mice.
Conclusions: These data indicate a similar beneficial potential of topical high dose PR022 HOCl (0.1%) in gel and
tofacitinib, in a translational murine model of atopic dermatitis.

Background
Although the incidence of atopic dermatitis (AD) is still
increasing, topical pharmaceutical treatment options for
AD are limited. Mostly traditional pharmaceutical treat-
ments like topical calcineurin inhibitors or glucocorticoids
are still used, but both have dose limiting side effects [1].
Currently there are some small clinical investigations on
the use of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) for the topical treat-
ment of AD [2]. It has been reported that HOCl has
anti-itch and anti-inflammatory potential in human AD
patients [2]. Thus, our group recently performed a
detailed preventive and therapeutic intervention study of
PR022, HOCl (0.05%) in gel in a chronic mouse model of
AD,
namely
the
NC/Nga
mice
sensitized
to
a
human-relevant allergen (house dust mite allergen). We
found a significant inhibition of lesion development and
scratching behaviour in the preventive setting and a
reduction of lesions and itch in a therapeutic setting ac-
companied by reduced immunoglobulin E (IgE) response,
cytokine secretion in skin and responsiveness of sensory
neurons. In vitro experiments with murine bone marrow
derived dendritic cells and dorsal root ganglia neurons
also revealed an inhibition of MAP kinase activity, inhi-
bition
of
NFκB
pathway
and
sensory
response
by
pre-incubation of low concentrations of HOCl [3].

 Therefore, the present study was performed to test a
higher concentration (0.1%) of hypochlorous acid in the
NC/Nga mice model in comparison to the Janus kinase
(JAK) inhibitor tofacitinib, both of which are currently
in clinical studies for treatment of human AD [4]. Apart
from efficacy, a further target was to evaluate local tole-
rability of a higher HOCl concentration.
Methods
Materials and reagents
Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) was used as a gel formulation
(0.1% AFC, pH 5.5 ± 0.5) and was supplied as “PR022” by
Realm Therapeutics, Inc. (Malvern, PA, USA). PR022 is a
proprietary formulation of stabilized hypochlorous acid in a
gelling agent and an emollient in development for the treat-
ment of atopic dermatitis. In the Phase 2 clinical study, 2
concentrations of PR022 are being evaluated, 0.05 and 0.1%
(NCT03351777). For active sensitization, house dust mite
allergen (Dermatophagoides farina, GREER, Lenoir, NC,
USA) was used. Poly-L-lysine, laminin, capsaicin, allyl iso-
thiocyanate (AITC), 2-mercaptoethanol and mineral oil
were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). Dispase
was
purchased
from
STEMCELL
Technologies
Inc.
(Cambridge,
MA,
USA).
Fura-2-acetoxymethyl
ester
(Fura-2 AM), phosphate buffered saline (PBS), collagenase,
chloroquine, histamine, and SLIGRL-NH2 were ordered
from Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (Waltham, MA, USA).
Fetal bovine serum (FBS), Dulbecco’s modified eagle
medium with
L-glutamine (DMEM) and RPMI-1640
medium, Ca2+ and Mg2+-free hank’s balanced salt solution
(HBSS), penicillin-streptomycin and fetal bovine serum
(FBS) were from Mediatech Inc. (Manassas, VA, USA).
MEM eagle (EMEM) medium was obtained from Lonza
Group Ltd. (Allendale, NJ, USA). For determination of pro-
tein content DCs protein assay kit was used (BIO-RAD,
Richmond, CA, USA). The murine IgE ELISA (OptEIA) set
was ordered
from
Becton,
Dickinson
and Company
(Franklin Lakes, NJ). Recombinant mouse interleukin
(IL-)1β, IL-31, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α were
purchased from Pepro Tech, Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ, USA).
Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits for
IL-1β, IL-4, IL-13, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP),
thymus and activation regulated chemokine (TARC), and
TNFα were obtained from R&D systems (Minneapolis,
MN, USA). Serotonin and tofacitinib were ordered from
Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK).
Mice
NC/Nga (female) mice were ordered from Charles River
Japan Laboratories (Tokyo, Japan). The mice arrived at 35
to 40 days of age and were kept in quarantine for at least
1 week. The facility offered a controlled environment (in-
cluding individually ventilated cages and sentinel animals).
The animals were housed at 22 °C with 50% humidity with
a 12-h light cycle. The mice were fed with certified pellet
diet and received water ad libitum. The study protocol
was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of
the North Carolina State University (IACUC Protocol No.
13–111-B).
Murine model of atopic dermatitis in NC/Nga mice
Prior to first sensitization, NC/Nga mice were clipped on
their back. The following day, mice were sensitized with
30 μl of house dust mite allergen (HDM) suspended
(10 mg/ml) in mineral oil and applied topically onto the
back twice weekly. To accelerate sensitization, mild tape
stripping (“Staples” office tape) was performed weekly just
before the first HDM sensitization. Tape stripping was
terminated as soon as visible lesions had developed. Treat-
ment of HOCl (0.1% in gel, n = 8), tofacitinib (0.5% in lipo-
derm, n = 8) or vehicle (gel, n = 8) was started on day 15,
where the mice showed a mean lesional score of 2.1. The
mice were equally distributed according to their clinical
score, that each treatment group represents the mean of
2.1. One group of mice (n = 6) was left untreated and
served as a base control. The dose selection for tofacitinib
was according to a former study in which 0.5% tofacitinib
inhibited itch behaviour and inflammation in a mouse
model of allergic contact dermatitis, higher doses (when
given in acetone) led to irritation of mouse skin, thus it was
decided to select a concentration of 0.5% [5].
During the experimental period, back skin thickness,
body weight, clinical scores and scratching behavior were
monitored once every week. The clinical score was deter-
mined as according to the following system: No symptoms,
0; mild, 1; moderate, 2; severe, 3 and extreme, 4. The mean
was calculated from the score for erosions, edema, and ery-
thema as well as skin dryness, as described previously [3].
To monitor scratching behaviour mice were video moni-
tored for 30 min directly after sensitization with HDM once
a week. Video monitoring was performed with mouse pairs
(belonging to the same treatment group) at the same cage.
Only repeated strokes with the hindlimb directed to the
area of HDM sensitization were counted as scratching bout.
Mice were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation according to
AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals and tissue
was collected from each group on day 32.
The back skin, blood and dorsal root ganglia (DRG)
were obtained from single mice 1 h after last HOCl or
tofacitinib application (this means 24 h after last HDM
challenge). Samples were processed (or stored) for IgE de-
termination, histology, cytokine determination and func-
tional measurement of intracellular Ca2+ in DRG neurons.
Histology
Tissue samples from rostral neck skin were excised,
fixed in paraformaldehyde (4% solution), sectioned and
stained with haematoxylin-eosin. Edema and cell influx
Fukuyama et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology  (2018) 19:37 
Page 2 of 8
 were evaluated semiquantitatively (0, no influx, no
edema; 1, mild; 2, moderate; and 3, severe influx, severe
edema) in a blinded manner in skin sections of each
mouse back skin (n = 8 for treatment groups, n = 6 for
untreated control).
Cytokine determination of skin tissues
One part of the rostral neck skin tissue was snap-frozen in
liquid nitrogen. Cytokine determination for skin tissues
was performed as described previously [6]. IL-1β, − 4, −
13, TARC, TSLP and TNFα were measured by ELISA.
Intra-assay variance was < 10%, inter-assay variance was
not calculated as each ELISA (30 samples) was done in
one setting (= one plate) for the present study.
Determination of total IgE in serum
Blood samples collected from single mice was centri-
fuged at 3000 g to isolate serum. We used an ELSA ac-
cording to the manufacturer’s protocol to determine
total IgE level present in serum.
Isolation of DRG and calcium imaging on DRG cell culture
Preparation and cultivation of the DRG neurons from
the NC/Nga mice was done as described previously [7].
Briefly, DRGs were dissected along the thoracic vertebral
column. Single ganglia were digested by means of
dispase and collagenase which was dissolved in HBSS
for 30 min at 37 °C. A trituration of DRG using
fire-polished Pasteur pipettes helped with dissociation.
Single cells were centrifuged/washed in DMEM medium
containing 10% FBS, resuspended in 50 μl medium and
placed onto poly-D-lysine and laminin-coated coverslips.
Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and then flooded
with 1 ml of medium and further incubated at 37 °C.
Calcium experiments were performed within 24 h of
culture.
Changes in intracellular [Ca2+] free concentration in
single neurons were measured by digital microscopy
connected to equipment for ratiometric recording of sin-
gle cells as described elsewhere [8]. In brief, coverslips
attached dorsal root ganglia cells were loaded with
fura-2 (8 μmol/L) in DMEM media and incubated at
37 °C for 30 min. For ratiometric imaging, the cells were
transferred to a tempered (37 °C) incubation chamber
on the stage of the microscope and constantly perfused
with Locke solution. Cells that incorporated fura2 were
identified using fluorescence microscopy before starting
the ratiometric experiment. Cells were marked with re-
gion of interest circles and monitored by sequential dual
excitation, 340 and 380 nm. The frequency of image
acquisition was 100 ms. DRG neurons were initially ex-
posed to IL-1β (1 μg/ml), TNFα (1 μg/ml), histamine
(1 mmol/l), followed by IL-31 (1 μg/ml), chloroquine
(10 μmol/l), serotonin (1 mmol/l), AITC (100 μmol/l),
capsaicin (1 μmol/l) and KCl (75 mmol/l). However,
none of the cells were stimulated with more than 3–4
stimuli in the row and the order was switched randomly
from slide to slide always ending with KCl. The cells
were superfused with a steady Locke solution flux for at
least 180 s. after each stimulus as a recovery for the cells
prior to the next stimulus.
Statistical analysis
All data are displayed as mean (±SD). Statistical signifi-
cance of the difference was estimated at the 5 and 1%
levels of probability. If only the significance of differences
between mean values of 2 groups were tested, Student t
test was used. For comparisons of more than 2 groups we
used a one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple
comparison test. Comparisons of proportions (study with
dorsal root ganglia) were made by means of the Fisher
exact test. The data analysis was performed with Prism 4
(GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).
Results
High dose of hypochlorous acid and tofacitinib reduce
lesions and itch in the murine NC/Nga model of AD
To monitor the disease severity of the murine atopic
like lesions we scored these according to the four
major clinical symptoms of atopic dermatitis, namely
excoriations, edema, and erythema and skin dryness.
After starting HDM application, the lesional score
gradually increased in the vehicle group starting from
day 6. Topical administration of 0.1% HOCl and 0.5%
tofacitinib
resulted
in
reduction
in
skin
lesions
compared to the vehicle-only group. This difference
became significant 10 days after initiation of HOCl
treatment and 6 days after tofacitinib treatment initi-
ation (Fig. 1a).
In analogy to the lesion
severity
scratching bouts steadily increased throughout the
study in the vehicle control group. This scratching
behaviour was significantly reduced by topical admin-
istration of HOCl or tofacitinib compared to that of
vehicle control group (Fig. 1b). A decrease of back
skin thickness was observed in both treatment groups
indicating a reduced lichenification (Fig. 1c). There
was no difference in bodyweight in vehicle control,
tofacitinib and hypochlorous acid gel indicating a lack
of systemic
effect of these two topical treatment
options (data not shown).
The histological evaluation confirmed the in vivo
findings: At day 32 vehicle treated mice had markedly
increased edema formation and inflammatory cell influx.
This was significantly reduced by topical treatment with
HOCl and tofacitinib compared to vehicle treatment
(Fig. 2a and b).
As a more objective measure of allergic inflammation
in the skin and to corroborate histological findings,

 tissue cytokines were determined in back skin. In
addition to an impact on pleiotropic pro-inflammatory
cytokines like IL-1β, and TNFα, the level of classical
Th2 cytokines like TARC, IL-4 and IL-13 was strongly
diminished by treatment with hypochlorous acid gel or
tofacitinib compared to the vehicle control treatment in
back skin. In addition, the cytokine TSLP which has
been described to be a direct pruritogen, was also signifi-
cantly reduced (Table 1). By direct comparison of reduc-
tion of cytokines by tofacitinib and HOCl it seems that
tofacitinib was more potent in reducing the cytokines
(significantly for IL-4).
Total IgE was vastly increased compared to untreated
age matched mice after chronic treatment with HDM.
This increase was significantly reduced by topical ad-
ministration of hypochlorous acid gel or tofacitinib com-
pared to vehicle control treatment (Fig. 2c).
The ex-vivo-response of sensory neurons to different
pruritus stimuli is diminished after HOCl or tofacitinib
treatment
Both, HOCl and tofacitinib application had a signifi-
cant effect on itch behavior. Thus, in a next step we
assessed
whether
this
response
could
also
be
retraced on dorsal root ganglia (DRG) ex vivo. For
this, DRG were obtained from NC/Nga mice treated
with vehicle, HOCl gel or tofacitinb and the ex vivo
response
of
DRG
neurons
to
histamine
and
non-histaminergic
stimuli
(serotonin,
chloroquine,
IL-31) were compared to DRG obtained from vehicle
treated, house dust mite sensitized mice and a basal
control (i.e. untreated, age matched NC/Nga mice).
When DRG of hypochlorous acid gel or tofacitinib
treated mice were monitored, histamine as well as
non-histaminergic
stimuli
led
to
significant
less

 sensory nerve activation compared to vehicle treated
mice (Fig. 3a). In addition, we observed that an en-
hanced response to AITC (TRPA1 channel activator)
as well as capsaicin (TRPV1 channel activator) was
also reduced, which can be interpreted as a sign of
reduced peripheral sensitization (Fig. 3b).
Discussion
Atopic dermatitis (AD), a multifactorial allergic-inflam-
matory disease with complex pathophysiology, remains
incurable and affects 10 to 20% of children [9, 10].
The two major symptoms of AD are pruritus (itch)
and inflammatory lesions. Topical treatment options

were sacrificed on study day 32 and histological samples were taken for the detrermination of edema and inflammatory cell influx. Both
treatment options led to significantly reduced edema (a, c) and inflammatory cell influx (b, c) compared to vehicle treated and HDM challenged
mice. d Whereas a HDM challenge led to a vast increase of total IgE in vehicle treated mice, this concentration was significantly reduced by

 are limited and the frequently used glucocorticoids
and calcineurin inhibitors have side effects, particu-
larly with their long-term use [11].
In the present study employing the NC/Nga mouse
model of AD, topical treatment with 0.1% hypochlorous
acid showed a therapeutic effect in an established atopic
dermatitis mouse model, significantly reducing both le-
sions and allergic itch throughout the experimental
period. Results showed HOCl gel to have equivalent effi-
cacy to the topical JAK inhibitor tofacitinib in reducing
clinical manifestations of the disease (such as lesion
score) as well as reducing the itch response. Although
the reduction sets in faster in the tofacitinib group, the
overall effect on day 31 were comparable. Tofacitinib
was chosen as a comparator, as first results of a clinical
phase II study revealed a great benefit of this topically
administered JAK inhibitor. As a glucocorticoid was
chosen as comparator in a former study, this offers the
comparison with another topical therapeutic with a
different mechanism of action.
In the present study we used a gel that is formulated
at a pH range 6 (+/− 0.5). In this specific formulation
available
free
chlorine
is
present
in
the
form
of
hypochlorous
acid
at
a
concentration
of
ca.
0.1%
(1000 ppm), a concentration which displayed no safety
concerns in mice in this study. Although no side-by-side
comparison has been performed, compared to the
former study, the onset of reduction of itch and lesion
score seems faster, when HOCl is formulated as 0.1%
compared to 0.05% [3]. It took 17 treatment days to re-
duce the lesion score to > 50% compared to vehicle in
the former study [3], whereas more than 50% reduction
was already achieved after 10 treatment days in the
current study.
During the study, a steady increase of scratching
behavior was observed within the first 14 days of
sensitization with house dust mite antigen (Fig. 1b).
Comparable to the former study, we again observed a
higher responsiveness to pruritic stimuli ex vivo in com-
parison to non-sensitized and age matched NC/Nga
mice. The sensory neurons excised from vehicle treated
and house dust mite antigen sensitized and challenged
NC/Nga mice were generally more responsive to stimuli
like IL-31, IL-1β, TNFα, histamine, chloroquine, sero-
tonin, capsaicin and AITC. These results can be inter-
preted as a general state of peripheral sensitization often

(1 μmol/l) were compared to DRG obtained from age matched vehicle treated and house dust mite antigen sensitized and challenged NC/Nga
mice. The sensory nerve activation in dorsal root ganglia isolated from hypochlorous acid or tofacitinib treated mice were reduced in response to

 seen with stages of chronic itch [12]. Both therapeutic
options (HOCl as well as tofacitinib) let to a significant
reduction of this hyper responsiveness. These results can
be interpreted as a reduction or normalization of sensory
neurotransmission, which finds its in vivo correlation in
the significant reduction of scratching behaviour. A limi-
tation of this study is that the number of mice taken for
each group do not allow a non-inferiority comparison
between HOCl and tofacitinib (which was not the
intention of this study).Thus, a comparison of the inhibi-
tory effect can only be made descriptively. Nevertheless,
compared
to
vehicle
treated
mice,
both
treatment
options showed significant reduction of itch and lesions
at the end of the study.
NC/Nga mice are frequently used for mechanistic
studies as well as for testing new therapeutic options of
AD [3, 13]. The advantage of this model is that lesions
are induced with a relevant allergen (house dust mite
antigen) and the phenotype is quite translational to the
human counterpart (constant itch, Th2 cytokines, liche-
nification and enhanced IgE levels) [14]. Taken together,
it seems that even a repeated/chronic administration of
a hydrogel containing 0.1% available free chlorine hypo-
chlorous acid is well tolerated and reveals significant
anti-inflammatory and anti-itch properties, comparable
to a JAK inhibitor (tofacitinib) which is currently in clin-
ical phase III for the treatment of human AD. Reduced
inflammation was confirmed histologically and by re-
duced concentrations of cytokines, which are frequently
associated with atopic dermatitis (IL-4, IL-13, TARC [9])
and cytokines for which a major role in the mediation of
itch has been described (TSLP [15]).
Conclusions
A repeated/chronic administration of a hydrogel containing
0.1% available free chlorine hypochlorous acid is well toler-
ated and reveals significant anti-inflammatory and anti-itch
properties, comparable to a JAK inhibitor (tofacitinib)
which is currently in clinical phase III for the treatment of
human AD.
