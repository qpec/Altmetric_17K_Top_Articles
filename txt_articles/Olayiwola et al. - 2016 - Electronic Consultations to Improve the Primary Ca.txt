Electronic Consultations to Improve the Primary Care-
Specialty Care Interface for Cardiology in the Medically 
Underserved: A Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial
ABSTRACT
PURPOSE Communication between specialists and primary care clinicians is 
suboptimal, and access to referrals is often limited, which can lead to lower 
quality, inefficiency, and errors. An electronic consultation (e-consultation) is an 
asynchronous, non-face-to-face consultation between a primary care clinician 
and a specialist using a secure electronic communication platform. The purpose 
of this study was to conduct a randomized controlled trial of e-consultations to 
test its efficacy and effectiveness in reducing wait times and improving access to 
specialty care.
METHODS Primary care clinicians were randomized into a control (9 traditional) 
or an intervention (17 e-consultation) arm for referrals to cardiologists. Primary 
care clinicians were recruited from 12 practice sites in a community health center 
in Connecticut with mainly medically underserved patients. Two end points were 
analyzed with a Cox proportional hazards model where the hazard of either a 
visit or an e-consultation was linked to study arm, sex, race, and age. 
RESULTS Thirty-six primary care clinicians participated in the study, referring 590 
patients. In total, 69% of e-consultations were resolved without a visit to a cardi-
ologist. After adjusting for covariates, median days to a review for an electronic 
consultation vs a visit for control patients were 5 and 24, respectively. A review 
of 6-month follow-up data found fewer cardiac-related emergency department 
visits for the intervention group.
CONCLUSION E-consultation referrals improved access to and timeliness of care 
for an underserved population, reduced overall specialty utilization, and stream-
lined specialty referrals without any increase in adverse cardiovascular outcomes. 
e-consultations are a potential solution for improving access to specialty care.

INTRODUCTION
T
he number of ambulatory care visits that result in a referral to 
another health care clinician has doubled during the past decade.1 
Timely access and good communication between clinicians are 
essential for quality, efficiency, and patient safety. In a national survey, 
however, only 34% of specialists reported routinely receiving informa-
tion from referring primary care clinicians, and only 62% of the clinicians 
reported reliably receiving information back from the specialist.2 This 
suboptimal exchange of information leads to an increase in medical errors, 
wasteful spending, and poor quality of care.3,4
In addition, access to subspecialty care is often limited, especially for 
medically underserved populations. At least 1 in 4 medical encounters at 
community health centers result in a referral to a specialist.5 Obtaining 
appointments for these referrals is challenging because so few special-
ists are willing to accommodate them.5,6 This imbalance in supply and 
demand leads to waiting times for appointments that can be as long as 1

year.7-9 Inadequate access to care is a major contribu-
tor to health care disparities, higher rates of disability, 
chronic disease sequelae, and death.5,10
Electronic consultations (e-consultations) are an 
emerging technology that may help address these 
problems by improving communication and informa-
tion exchange between health care clinicians and pro-
viding timely access to efficient and high-quality care 
for patients.11,12 An e-consultation is an asynchronous, 
non-face-to-face consultation between a primary care 
clinician and a specialist using a secure electronic com-
munication platform. In many cases, the clinician can 
manage the patient’s condition with guidance from the 
specialist provided via the e-consultation. In other cases, 
additional workup or an in-person visit is recommended.
Observational studies suggest the potential for 
e-consultations to reduce not only waiting times for 
specialty care13 but also the need for face-to-face con-
sultations from 8.9% to 51% depending on setting 
and specialty.7-10,13-15 There are no published studies, 
however, showing the effect of an e-consultation pro-
gram on utilization and clinical outcomes. In addition, 
most e-consultation programs have been implemented 
in integrated delivery systems with a shared electronic 
health record (EHR) or a designated specialty care 
network.10,16-18
To address these gaps in the evidence, we con-
ducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial of cardi-
ologists’ e-consultations in a large and geographically 
dispersed, multisite federally qualified health center. 
We chose cardiology as the specialty because it had 
high rates of referral and limited access.
METHODS
Design Overview
The cardiology e-consultation study is a prospec-
tive, cluster-randomized, controlled intervention trial 
carried out between October 2011 and December 
2013 at Community Health Center, Inc (CHCI) in 
Connecticut.
Setting and Participants
CHCI is a level-3 recognized patient-centered medi-
cal home providing comprehensive primary medical, 
behavioral, and dental care to medically underserved 
patients. More than 60% of CHCI patients are racial/
ethnic minorities, more than 90% are at or below the 
200% federal poverty level, more than 60% have state 
Medicaid insurance, and almost 25% are uninsured. 
Patients receive primary medical care by internists, 
family physicians, pediatricians, nurse practitioners, 
and physician assistants. Most of CHCI’s practice sites 
rely on hospitals and specialists in their own commu-
nities for referrals, or they send their patients to the 
state-funded University of Connecticut Health Center 
(UCHC), located in the central part of the state.
All primary care clinicians caring for adult patients 
at CHCI’s 12 primary care centers who worked at 
least 30 hours per week were eligible and invited to 
participate in the study. E-consultations were provided 
by cardiologists from UCHC, for which cardiologists 
were reimbursed $25 each.
Randomization and Intervention
All participating primary care clinicians entered into 
the study voluntarily, signed a written consent form, 
and were informed that they could discontinue partici-
pation at any time. All patients referred to a cardiolo-
gist by the clinician participating in the study were 
included in the study. Enrolled clinicians were block-
randomized into the intervention arm (e-consultation 
referral) or the control arm (traditional referral) of the 
study using fixed-size blocks of 4; investigators were 
blinded to the block size, block number, and sequence 
in the block. One author who was not involved in 
data collection and final data analysis generated the 
allocation sequence and assigned participants to the 
study groups. Of the 2 principal investigators, 1 was 
blinded to clinician participation and group assign-
ment, whereas the other provided oversight of clinical 
research activities. Because of the nature of the inter-
vention, participants were not blinded. Research staff 
who were abstracting medical records were blinded 
to the patient study group. The CHCI Institutional 
Review Board approved this protocol, including a 
waiver of patient informed consent. The trial was reg-
istered through Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02376855).
The intervention consisted of an e-consultation 
pathway and a standardized protocol for clinicians 
to obtain cardiology consultations using a secure 
peer-to-peer messaging module embedded within the 
EHR. The intervention period lasted 1 year, ending 
on July 31, 2013. During this period, all adult cardiol-
ogy referrals from intervention clinicians were sent via 
the e-consultation pathway unless they were deemed 
urgent by the clinician or were for patients who had an 
already established relationship with a cardiologist.
Intervention clinicians were trained to use the 
e-consultation module to create referrals in the 
same way they created traditional referrals: state the 
reason(s) for the referral, include any relevant test 
results, records or reports; and submit through the 
EHR. The e-consultation referrals were then sent elec-
tronically to the cardiology consultants by a referral 
coordinator. A team of 3 cardiologists from UCHC 
maintained a coverage schedule and responded to 
e-consultation referrals within 2 business days.

Responses from the cardiologist were received by 
the referring clinician as an incoming message within 
the EHR. Responses were case-specific and gener-
ally contained recommendations for management, 
additional testing, or a face-to-face cardiologist’s visit. 
The clinician was responsible for considering and act-
ing upon recommendations and determining when an 
e-consultation was complete. When a face-to-face visit 
was recommended, the clinician referred the patient to 
a cardiologist based on location and the patient’s pref-
erence. Notes from the e-consultation accompanied 
the referral to any cardiologist. Clinicians random-
ized to the control group continued to refer patients 
using the standard CHCI referral process, which 
also involved the creation and submission of a refer-
ral in the EHR. Referral coordinators then processed 
the referral, contacted specialist offices to obtain an 
appointment, and faxed relevant clinical information 
and attachments. Consultation notes from the cardiol-
ogist were returned via fax and scanned into the EHR.
Outcomes and Follow-up
The primary study outcome was the time to a consulta-
tion with a cardiologist. This outcome was defined as 
either a completed e-consultation that did not require 
further follow-up, or a documented face-to-face visit 
with a cardiologist. Secondary outcomes included the 
completion rate of referrals to cardiologists and the 
number of face-to-face visits in each group. Other sec-
ondary outcomes included adverse events, including 
death, myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass 
grafting, urgent or emergent cardiac catheterization 
and/or angioplasty, hospital utilization for potential car-
diac complaints or events, and emergency department 
utilization for potential cardiac complaints or events. 
All adverse events were measured as binary outcomes.
Demographic, clinical, and operational data, includ-
ing the outcome of the consultation request, was 
collected for all patients referred to a cardiologist by 
primary care clinicians in the study for the 12-month 
intervention period and for a 6-month follow-up 
period. Faxes and other documents contained in the 
charts of all patients were reviewed by trained research 
staff using a formal chart abstraction tool to identify 
any adverse events, tests, and results, including addi-
tional specialty visits, diagnostic procedures, hospi-
talizations, and emergency department visits. One 
principal investigator (D.A.) conducted a secondary 
review of any case for which there were questions. In 
addition, we reviewed any question contained in each 
consultation. The clinician’s experience was assessed 
with a brief online survey administered to the inter-
vention group at baseline, mid-intervention, and 12 
months. The survey assessed general satisfaction with 
the intervention, ease of use, and impact on workload, 
and these findings will be reported separately.
Statistical Analysis
Primary analysis involved analyzing the event time end 
point with a Cox proportional hazards model,19 where 
the hazard (instantaneous risk) of either a face-to-face 
visit or completed e-consultation was linked to study 
arm, sex, race, and age using the R package “survival.”20 
In preliminary analysis, a Cox model with time-varying 
coefficient21 was fitted to test the proportional hazards 
assumption using the R package “timereg.”22 The null 
hypothesis of a constant coefficient for the treatment 
group over time could not be rejected, indicating that 
the proportional hazards assumption was appropriate. 
Because the unit of randomization was the clinician, we 
fitted the proportional hazards model using the coxph 
function, which allowed us to specify a marginal model 
that adjusted for the clustering of patients within clini-
cians.23,24 Secondary analysis included differences in 
adverse events and emergency departments visits, as 
well as hospitalizations between study arms.
RESULTS
Forty-four primary care clinicians were invited, and 36 
gave consent and were randomized. Nineteen clini-
cians were assigned to the control group, and 17 to the 
e-consultation group. The demographic and baseline 
clinical characteristics of the participating clinicians 
and their 590 patients referred during the study period 
are displayed in Table 1. Clinicians’ mean age and 
years in practice were 39 and 8 years, respectively; 
most were family physicians. Mean age of patients 
referred to a cardiologist by study clinicians was 53 
years; 39% were white and 35% Hispanic or Latino; 
54% were female. Three clinicians dropped out of the 
study when they left the organization; the remaining 
clinicians stayed in the study for the duration of the 
trial. Patients in each study arm had very similar demo-
graphic profiles. In addition, patients referred by clini-
cians in each study arm were well matched with regard 
to baseline clinical characteristics and cardiac risk as 
assessed by diabetes or hypertension status, smoking, 
or Framingham cardiovascular risk scores.
Referral pathways and outcomes are displayed in 
Figure 1. In the intervention group, 120 of 229 car-
diology referrals (52%) were sent electronically as an 
e-consultation. The remaining 109 referrals (48%) were 
not sent through e-consultation pathway because of 
urgency (23 referrals) or the existence of an established 
relationship between the patient and a local cardiolo-
gist (86 referrals). The percentage of clinicians’ refer-
rals sent via an e-consultation in the intervention arm

varied somewhat. Of the 12 clinicians who made 5 
or more cardiology referrals during the intervention, 
8 sent 50% or more via the e-consultation pathway, 
with 17 of 19 clinicians sending 89%. Four clinicians 
sent fewer than 50% of their referrals through the 
e-consultation pathway. The clinician with the lowest 
percentage of e-consultations sent none of 9 referrals 
through the e-consultation pathway. The most com-
mon reasons for consultation referrals made through 
the e-consultation pathway were abnormal electrocar-
diogram (ECG) findings, after which came 
chest pain, preoperative assessment, and 
hypertension. For the patients referred 
directly for face-to-face consultations, the 
most common reason was follow-up for 
established coronary artery disease, then 
chest pain, heart failure, hypertension, and 
abnormal findings on an ECG.
For the 120 patients in the interven-
tion group referred to a cardiologist via 
the e-consultation pathway, 83 (69.2%) 
were believed by the reviewing cardiolo-
gist to be manageable by the clinicians 
and not require a face-to-face visit. In 33 
(27.5%) of the e-consultation referrals, 
the reviewing cardiologist recommended 
a face-to-face visit. The remaining 4 
(3.3%) e-consultation referrals were never 
received or reviewed by the specialist 
reviewer because of technical problems 
with the e-consultation system. Patients 
with heart failure and follow-up of an 
established diagnosis of coronary artery 
disease were more commonly referred 
for a face-to-face visit, whereas questions 
about abnormal ECG findings were man-
aged electronically.
Most e-consultation referrals were 
completed with 1 exchange (clinician-
cardiologist-clinician). There was no 
statistically significant change in rates of 
referral during the course of the interven-
tion in either study arm.
Table 2 presents results from Cox 
regression model assessing the impact of 
an e-consultation on the time between the 
request and completion of a consultation. 
These results reflect differences in the 
likelihood that a primary care referral will 
result in a completed consultation with 
a cardiologist, which for e-consultation 
patients was the date on which the car-
diologist’s response occurred. The model 
presents an intention-to-treat analysis, 
as patients assigned to the intervention group who 
bypassed the e-consultation pathway were ana-
lyzed with the intervention group. Control variables 
included in the model were patients’ age, sex, and race 
and ethnicity (black, Hispanic, other race vs white), 
and priority status of the consultation request (routine 
vs urgent or critical).
Results from this analysis indicate that patients in 
the intervention group were significantly more likely 
to receive a consultation from a cardiologist than were

case) indicated that those receiving e-consultations 
were almost 4 times (OR = 3.74, 95% CI , 2.60-5.39) 
more likely than control patients to have had their case 
reviewed by a cardiologist among those in the inter-
vention group (data not shown). 
To provide additional context for evaluating these 
results, Table 3 presents the median times to a cardiol-
ogy visit and the percentage of patients not receiving a 
consultation with a cardiologist within 31 and 180 days 
among 3 groups: (1) those receiving an e-consultation 
referral, (2) those in the intervention group who 
received a traditional referral (ie, bypassed the 
e-consultation pathway), and (3) the control patients. 
Medians and percentages were derived from the Cox 
regression results presented in Table 2, which calcu-
lated time to occurrence of the e-consultation review 
or the face-to-face follow-up among patients receiving 
a traditional referral. Dramatic differences in the time 
to a consultation with a cardiologist were observed 
among patients in the 3 groups. The median number of 
days to a consultation for e-consultation patients was 5, 
compared with 29 and 24 among intervention patients 
receiving traditional referrals (ie, those that bypassed 
the e-consultation pathway) and control patients, 
respectively. The percentage of patients who did not 
receive a consultation with a cardiologist within 1 and 
6 months of the initial referral also differed dramati-
cally between groups.
Patients referred via the traditional consultation 
pathway had higher rates of emergency department 
utilization than those receiving e-consultation referrals 
during the 6-month follow-up (Table 4). Though the 
study was not powered to detect statistical differences, 
among the 21 emergency department visits for patients 
in the control group, 6 (29%) occurred in the time 
between the clinician’s request and the patient’s consul-
tation with the cardiologist.
Surveys assessing primary care clinicians’ experi-
ences with an e-consultation were completed by 8 
of 17 clinicians (47%) in the intervention group. Six 
clinicians (75%) believed that the e-consultation had 
either no impact or resulted in a decrease in their 
overall workload, requiring no more than 5 minutes 
to enter and send. All respondents were satisfied or 
highly satisfied with the quality and timeliness of the 
e-consultation responses.
DISCUSSION
The results from the first randomized study of referrals 
for an e-consultation reveal the potential to improve 
safely and efficiently the primary care–specialty con-
sultation process using an electronic communication 
platform. Approximately one-half of all cardiology 
referrals met our criteria to be sent via e-consultation, 
and two-thirds of those did not require a face-to-face 
visit. Moreover, e-consultation reviews were completed, 
on average, almost a month sooner than those sent for 
a face-to-face consultation, even those deemed urgent 
by the referring clinician. Although there was some 
variability in use of the e-consultation pathway by indi-
vidual clinicians, likely reflecting differences in case mix 
(more cases of urgent or established disease in some 
clinicians’ panels) or in a clinician’s comfort and assess-
ment of the urgency of the requested 
consultation, most of the clinicians used 
that pathway for one-half or more refer-
rals. Either way, these results show that a 
substantial number of consultations can 
be safely and more efficiently managed 
though a secure electronic exchange of 
information, with improved convenience 
for the patient as well. Careful evaluation 
of the impact of e-consultation on patient 
safety and quality of care was undertaken 
through detailed reviews of the clinical

documentation, in the 6 months after the intervention 
(Table 4). We did not find any evidence that patients 
managed by clinicians who requested an e-consultation 
had more adverse cardiac outcomes than patients of 
clinicians in the control group. These findings, coupled 
with the reduction in waiting time for appointments 
and need for face-to-face specialist consultation suggest 
that e-consultation referrals may improve efficiency 
without compromising the quality of care.
This study has several limitations. The study focused 
on a single specialty, and the impact of e-consultations 
could vary among specialties.10 In addition, analysis of 
the clinical outcomes of patients relied on chart review 
of faxed documents to determine rates of hospitalization 
and emergency department use, and it is possible that 
not all records were in the EHR. This problem, how-
ever, would affect findings equally in both groups. Stud-
ies using claims-level data may provide more accurate 
information. In addition, the study had a small sample 
size of primary care clinicians and patients, so broad 
conclusions cannot be drawn. Further research should 
be done to assess e-consultations in settings other than 
federally qualified health centers, though the benefits of 
waiting time reduction and equivalent quality are likely 
applicable to other settings. Patients’ experience was not 
assessed and is an area for future exploration. Finally, 
technical problems with the e-consultation system led 
to 3.3% of e-consultation requests not receiving a spe-
cialist review. The study was not designed to formally 
detect adverse events. Further studies on safety and 
adverse events, particularly exploring the potential chal-
lenges of technology, are needed.
We found that e-consultation referrals are effective 
at increasing access to specialty care for underserved 
populations, reducing need for face-to-face specialty 
care, streamlining specialty referrals, and potentially 
reducing emergency department utilization. These 
findings have critical policy implications as health 
systems seek new ways to improve quality and reduce 
cost. There is also growing recognition that the 
e-consultation pathway may be fundamental to the 
success of accountable care organizations as part of a 
comprehensive strategy to streamline costs, improve 
quality, and better coordinate care.22 Though further 
research is needed to recommend e-consultations for 
wide use across settings and specialties, e-consultations 
showed great promise in advancing integration of the 
patient-centered medical home into the larger medical 
neighborhood and potentially mitigating health dispar-
ities in access and treatment in our study population.
