abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Payers are implementing alternative payment models that attempt 
to align payment with high-value care. This study calculates the breakeven capitated 
payment rate for a midsize pediatric practice and explores how several different staffing 
scenarios affect the rate.
METHODS: We supplemented a literature review and data from >200 practices with interviews 
of practice administrators, physicians, and payers to construct an income statement for a 
hypothetical, independent, midsize pediatric practice in fee-for-service. The practice was 
transitioned to full capitation to calculate the breakeven capitated rate, holding all practice 
parameters constant. Panel size, overhead, physician salary, and staffing ratios were varied 
to assess their impact on the breakeven per-member per-month (PMPM) rate. Finally, 
payment rates from an existing health plan were applied to the practice.
RESULTS: The calculated breakeven PMPM was $24.10. When an economic simulation allowed 
core practice parameters to vary across a broad range, 80% of practices broke even with 
a PMPM of $35.00. The breakeven PMPM increased by 12% ($3.00) when the staffing ratio 
increased by 25% and increased by 23% ($5.50) when the staffing ratio increased by 38%. 
The practice was viable, even with primary care medical home staffing ratios, when rates 
from a real-world payer were applied.
CONCLUSIONS: Practices are more likely to succeed in capitated models if pediatricians 
understand how these models alter practice finances. Staffing changes that are common in 
patient-centered medical home models increased the breakeven capitated rate. The degree 
to which team-based care will increase panel size and offset increased cost is unknown.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Payers are 
introducing alternative payment models nationwide 
in the hopes of improving quality and reducing 
costs. Although previous studies have evaluated 
their effects on spending and outcomes, few have 
explored how they affect practice fi
 nances.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This study calculates the 
breakeven capitated payment rate for a midsize 
pediatric practice, provides a tool for practices to 
estimate their own breakeven rates, and models the 
relationship between attributed patient volume and 
payment rates under several practice scenarios.

Health care spending continues to 
grow at an unsustainable rate and 
is increasingly unaffordable for 
many Americans. 
1, 
 
2 The fee-for-
service (FFS) payment method that 
dominates health care payments 
contributes to inefficiency by 
rewarding volume and ignoring 
quality. 
3 
 
– 
7 To address these 
deficiencies, public and private 
payers are experimenting with 
alternative payment models (APMs) 
that attempt to align payments with 
improved value. More than 21 million 
lives are covered through primary 
care medical homes (PCMHs), where 
FFS payments are increasingly 
augmented with partially capitated 
per-member per-month (PMPM) 
payments. 
8 As of 2014, >40% of all 
commercial in-network payments are 
value based. 
9
Pediatricians must understand APMs 
and their implications for practice 
financials. These payment models 
can be confusing, they often lack 
transparency, and there is limited 
evidence to guide providers in 
understanding them. 
10 To address 
this knowledge gap, we present a 
simplified financial model, which 
converts a hypothetical, independent, 
midsize, general pediatric practice 
from FFS to full capitation. The 
analysis calculates the aggregated 
capitated rate necessary for the 
practice to break even compared with 
FFS, provides a financial analysis tool 
for practices, and investigates the 
relationship between the breakeven 
capitated rate and variations in 
practice parameters including panel 
size, overhead, physician salary, and 
staffing ratio. Finally, mean payment 
rates from a real-world payer are 
applied to assess practice viability.
METHODS
Model and Data Sources
This analysis constructs income 
statements for a practice with 6 
clinicians, including 5 full-time 
equivalent (FTE) physicians and 
1 FTE advanced practice provider 
(APP); FTEs may be allocated 
between multiple part-time 
providers. The outcome variable 
of interest is the breakeven 
comprehensive capitated rate 
inclusive of shared savings and 
quality incentive payments.
The income statement was developed 
after interviews with 3 public 
and private payers and 2 practice 
administrators from midsize 
practices. Multiple data sources were 
used to establish model assumptions, 
including published medical 
literature, the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics, the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, the Medical 
Group Management Association, 
surveys from the American Academy 
of Pediatrics and American Academy 
of Family Physicians, and proprietary 
data from 200 independent 
pediatrics practices across 40 
states. As a robustness check, the 
final model was reviewed by 2 
additional practice administrators, 
1 commercial payer, and a pediatric 
practice consultant.
For simplicity, the model imposes a 
number of constraints. First, it makes 
a direct conversion from FFS to full 
capitation, inclusive of quality and 
cost incentive payments. Second, it 
shifts all patients in the practice to 
capitated payments simultaneously. 
Third, the capitated rate holds the 
panel size constant throughout the 
year and includes only responsibility 
for basic point-of-care testing, such 
as rapid strep, hemoglobin, and 
urinalysis. Fourth, any revenues 
from hospital consultations or 
circumcisions are excluded. Finally, 
the model simulates a 50/50 
payer mix between Medicaid and 
commercial payers.

Expense and Revenues Under FFS 
and Capitation
Published panel sizes vary widely, 
depending on practice style and the 
age distribution of the panel.

The model assumes a panel size 
of 1700 and an average of 3.24 
visits per patient per year.

Table 1 summarizes the core model 
assumptions, along with the range for 
each variable identified from multiple 
sources.
Total expenses are often reported as 
60% of actual revenue in pediatrics 
and family medicine.

To increase transparency and 
generalizability, the model separates 
staff salary and fringe benefit 
expenses from other overhead. 
Pediatricians’ salaries vary with 
differences in practice ownership, 
payer mix, productivity, and 
geographic location.

26 The 
model uses the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics national median salary of 
$180 000. 
25 Practice administrator 
salaries varied for similar reasons, 
and the model uses a salary of 
$92 000.27, 
 
28 The median salaries 
for APPs and registered nurses are 
consistently reported at $95 000 and 
$65 000, respectively.

salary are 15% for clinicians and the 
practice administrator and 30% for 
support staff. 
14, 
36 The model assumes 
a support staff to physician ratio of 
3.2. 
14, 
 
20, 
 
37 Overhead excluding staff 
expenses was set at 30% of revenue, 
resulting in total overhead of 62% of 
revenue.
Overhead costs excluding staff 
expenses are calculated as a 
percentage of total revenue in 
the capitated model. The model 
increases nonstaff overhead 
costs from 30% to 35% to allow 
for additional expenses such as 
electronic health record upgrades 
and reinsurance. 
38 
– 
40 Fewer 
resources may be needed for billing-
related administrative functions in 
capitated environments, but staff 
must still confirm valid insurance 
coverage, and detailed quality 
reporting is required. Because 
total expenses are calculated as a 
percentage of payments collected 
(not receivable) in the FFS model, 
the total expenses account for a 
similar proportion of revenues in 
the capitated model (63%).
Vaccines are a large expense for 
practices. Given the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention 
vaccine schedule for children 0 to 
18 years of age and current vaccine 
prices, average vaccination cost is 
~$135 per patient per year. 
41, 
 
42 
Practices typically break even or 
gain small profits from vaccinations 
billed to commercial payers, whereas 
the opposite is true for those billed 
to Medicaid. 
43 Because the modeled 
practice is a 50/50 payer mix, 
vaccines are excluded from both the 
FFS and capitation models.
Copayments may contribute 
meaningfully to practice revenues in 
both FFS and capitation. The model 
incorporates an average patient 
copayment of $8. This amount 
is calculated by multiplying the 
average commercial copays ($23) 
by the proportion of commercial 
patients (50%) and the likelihood 
that commercial plan requires 
copayments (66%). 
44 Many 
states allow (or will soon allow) 
nominal copayments for Medicaid 
beneficiaries, but these have been 
excluded from the model. 
45, 
 
46
In the FFS model, practice revenues 
are tied to physician and APP 
encounters. Practice revenues 
are calculated by multiplying the 
average number of visits per day, the 
number of providers, the number 
of clinical days per year, and the 
average payment per encounter. 
47 
The hypothetical practice assumes 
25 patients per day per provider, 
220 clinical days annually, and 
$100.00 average payment per 
visit. 
14, 
 
48 
–50 APPs may independently 
bill at 85% of physician fees, 
although APP roles may vary by 
practice. 
51 The FFS model accounts 
for rejected claims, no-shows, 
and uncompensated visits by writing 
off 10% of expected revenue. The 
model includes a 5% practice 
margin in both the FFS and capitated 
scenarios so that the practice is 
able to build and maintain financial 
reserves for upgrades or unexpected 
expenses.
In the capitated model, practice 
revenue is driven by attributed 
panel size and the average capitated 
payment. Instead of billing payers 
for individual patient encounters, 
capitated practices receive a risk 
adjusted base PMPM payment for 
each attributed patient. Particularly 
in pediatrics, the capitated rate 
should account for the age of covered 
patients. 
52 The model excludes 
vaccination, but if included in 
capitated payments, rates must be 
substantially higher and must 
allow for vaccine price increases, 
which occur annually if not more 
frequently.
Providers typically receive incentives 
for performance relative to quality 
and cost benchmarks. Quality and 
cost bonuses are paid when practices 
reach predetermined performance 
thresholds and as a percentage of 
spending compared with targets, 
respectively. For transparency, our 
model converts quality and shared 
savings payments into PMPMs. 
Incentive payments and copayments 
are added to the base PMPM to 
calculate total revenue.
In capitation: Net Income = Patient 
Co-payments + Capitation Base Rate + 
Utilization Incentives + Quality − 
Operating Expenses.
Sensitivity Analysis
Practices vary widely in organization 
and style. Our model presents an 
“average” practice, but several core 
assumptions may vary significantly 
between practices, including 
physician salary, panel size, and 
overhead. As a robustness check, an 
economic simulation was constructed 
where physician salary, panel size, 
and overhead less staff expenses 
were allowed to vary across the 
range of values in  
Table 1. Each 
simulation generated 500 different 
practices. The model was iterated 50 
times to generate a total of 25 000 
practices.
Practice Transformation
Because revenues are not tied to 
face-to-face physician or APP 
encounters, capitation models allow 
providers greater clinical autonomy 
than FFS, and all practice staff may 
contribute to patient care at the 
level to which they are legally 
entitled. 
13, 
 
37, 
 
53 
– 
56 We modified the 
practice’s staffing ratios to reflect 
2 published PCMH transformations 
to assess its effect on the PMPM.

In 1 example, an additional APP 
mental health provider, 2.5 nurses, 
1.5 clinical support staff, 
0.5 administrative support staff, and 
0.5 of a practice administrator were 
added. These additions increased 
the staffing ratio by 37% (3.2 to 4.4). 
In a second example, 2 nurses and 
2 clinical support staff were added.

These additions increase the staffing 
ratio by 25% (3.2 to 4.0).
Capitated Rates for a Real-World Payer
For illustrative purposes, we 
obtained capitated rates and 
program information for Capital 
District Physicians Health Plan 
(CDPHP), a health plan in upstate 
New York that serves nearly a half 
million commercial and Medicaid 
members. 
57 CDPHP provided data 
from 2013, including the base 
capitated rate, quality incentives, 
and shared savings incentives 
payments. We applied Medicaid, 
commercial, and 50:50 blended 
rates to our model with and without 
staffing changes, to assess the 
financial impact on our hypothetical 
practice.
RESULTS
In  
Fig 1, the left-side income 
statement is FFS, and the right side is 
capitation. With attributed patients, 
staffing, and salaries held constant, 
the minimum breakeven aggregated 
capitated rate for the hypothetical, 
independent, midsize practice was 
$24.10. This number may be reached 
in several ways. For example, a 
base PMPM rate of $20.60 could be 
supplemented with $1.50 PMPM 
quality incentive and a $2.00 PMPM 
cost incentive.  
Figure 2 illustrates 
the relationship between the panel 
size and the breakeven aggregated 
capitated payment rate. Practices 
that receive a PMPM above the 
line (in the green) generate higher 
revenues than the FFS scenario, 
whereas practices that receive a 
PMPM below the line (in the red) 
generate lower revenues than the 
FFS scenario.
 
Figure 3 illustrates the findings 
of the sensitivity analysis for 500 
practices. The figure shows the 
impact of random combinations of 
model inputs across the range of 
assumptions drawn from  
Table 1 on 
the breakeven aggregated capitated 
rate. In the simulation, 80% of 
practices would break even at an 
aggregated capitated rate between 
$16.12 and $35.00.
With physician and staff salaries 
again held constant,  
Fig 4 illustrates 
the relationship between breakeven 
aggregated capitated rates and the 
2 PCMH staffing transformations 
described above. The blue line 
represents the breakeven aggregated

losses, and a higher PMPM would lead to increased revenues.

PMPM with no staffing adjustments. 
The red line reflects the first staffing 
transformation (38% staffing 
increase), and the green line reflects 
the second practice transformation 
(25% staffing increase).
 
Table 2 presents CDPHP’s mean 
capitated rates for both its Medicaid 
and commercial populations, 
and program details including 
performance metrics and covered 
services. CDPHP began transitioning 
practices to full capitation in 2008 as 
part of its Enhanced Primary 
Care Initiative (EPCI). 
57 Many of 
CDPHP’s EPCI participating 
practices are also certified PCMHs. 
As in our model, vaccines are paid 
separately on an FFS basis in the 
CDPHP model. Age-, sex-, and risk-
adjusted capitated rates range 
from $13 to $65 and depend in 
part on whether the patient is in 
a commercial or Medicaid plan. 
The maximum incentive payment 
available is $5.32, but on average, 
practices earn 33% ($1.77) of the 
potential maximum.
Holding all assumptions constant 
in the FFS and capitation financial 
statements, the model applies 
the mean capitated payments of 
$22 (base Medicaid PMPM rate) 
and $36 (base commercial PMPM 
rate) plus $1.77 PMPM incentive 
payments (all patients). Our model 
resulted in a 4% and 25% margin 
in the Medicaid and commercial 
plans, respectively. A practice that 
blended 50% Medicaid and 50% 
commercial patients resulted in a 
base capitation rate of ~$29. After 
the $1.77 incentive payment, the 
blended practice earned a 17% 
margin; this rate was sufficient 
to support either of the 2 PCMH 
staffing transformations.
DISCUSSION
Given unsustainable growth in 
US health spending, public and 
commercial payers are transitioning 
to APMs that are intended to 
better align payment with value. 
Although many physicians have 
hesitated to participate in APMs, 
future participation in new 
payment models will probably 
be unavoidable. Thirty percent of 
Medicare payments are already 
tied to APMs. 
58 Pediatricians need 
to understand the implications 
of emerging payment models for 
practice organization and finances. 
Our model calculates the aggregated 
capitated rate where a pediatric 
practice would break even relative 
to FFS across a range of panel sizes, 
describes how that point would 
differ between practices, and 
illustrates the impact of staffing 
changes. Mean payment rates from 
a real-world capitated payment 
model, CDPHP, are applied as an 
illustration.
To our knowledge, no study has 
examined the practice financials

the extent that staffi
 ng changes increase effi
 ciency, the cost of additional staff may be offset by 
increased panel size.

capitation in pediatrics. Kuo et al 
59 
recently estimated primary care 
expenditures by Medicaid patients 
at $19 PMPM, 25% below our 
breakeven capitated rate. However, 
most commercial plans reimburse 
at higher rates than Medicaid plans, 
and our breakeven rate reflects 
the average of all patients in the 
practice. 
60
Practice style and organization 
vary in important ways. The 
sensitivity analysis presented 
in  
Fig 3 demonstrates a wide 
variation in breakeven rates 
based on these differences. The 
income statement shown in  
Fig 
1 may be adapted to calculate 
the breakeven capitated rate for 
specific practice circumstances. 
Even so, most practices will 
need technical assistance from 
payers to identify the number of 
attributed patients (panel size), 
assess performance on utilization 
and quality metrics, and project 
revenues. 
61 Capitation model 
designs also differ, as do eligibility 
and participation requirements; 
practices should pay careful 
attention to program terms 
when assessing the financial 
impact of participation. If 
vaccinations are included in 
the capitated payments, a new 
calculation is needed.
PCMH models are often paid through 
capitation at rates intended to 
support a team-based care approach 
that may lower costs and improve 
outcomes. 
8, 
 
62, 
 
63 In these models, 
physicians may elect to spend 
more time with the most complex 
patients while delegating simple 
visits to a broader team. For 
example, in the case of a pediatric 
patient with asthma, simple but 
important tasks such as teaching 
nebulizer technique and reviewing 
asthma action plans may be 
performed by nurses or medical 
assistants. 
64, 
65 Some clinicians 
may work with patients by phone, 
e-mail, Web chat, or even video call, 
potentially improving efficiency, 
access, and patient satisfaction. 
49, 
 
66 
However, not all PCMH models 
perform better than traditional 
primary care models. Studies 
of the effects of APMs and APM-
supported delivery reforms on 
health care expenditures and 
patient outcomes find mixed 
effects. 
67 
 
 
 
– 
73
PCMH practices often change 
staffing ratios to optimize the care 
team and extend services. The 
optimal staffing mix should be 
driven by practice and community 
needs. 
13, 
 
74 
– 
76 Many of these staffing 
changes will increase the breakeven 
capitated rate. Our findings are 
consistent with a recent review that 
found that PCMH staffing changes 
increase the breakeven capitated 
rate by ~$5.00 PMPM.54 Our first 
staffing model resulted 
in an increase of $5.50 (23%), and 
our second staffing model resulted 
in an increase of $3.00 (12%). 
Under capitation, practices may 
increase revenue by increasing 
panel size, increasing quality 
incentives, or increasing utilization 
incentives. There is therefore a 
dynamic relationship between 
staffing choices, practice efficiency, 
and the breakeven capitation rate. 
The mix of providers and services 
that optimizes efficiency and 
performance remains 
undefined. 
77
This study has several limitations. 
We modeled a midsize, 
independent, general pediatric 
practice, but many other practice 
configurations are possible. 
Practices differ in the number 
and type of providers, support 
staff ratios, overhead costs, and 
panel sizes. The model does not 
account for varying ratios of new 
to established patient visits or 
the time and payment differences 
between well and sick visits.
We based our practice on average 
data drawn from >200 pediatric 
practices distributed across a 
broad geographic area, the medical 
literature, and published surveys. 
Although our model illustrates 
important considerations in 
transitioning to capitation, our 
sensitivity analysis demonstrates 
wide variation in the breakeven 
capitation rate when assumptions 
are varied. Individual practices 
should use the income statement 
as a guide to calculate the 
breakeven capitated rate for their 
specific circumstances. Lastly, 
the assumption that all patients 
simultaneously transition from 
FFS to capitation is not typical, 
and most practices will participate 
in several payment models 
simultaneously.

CONCLUSIONS
Practices are more likely to succeed 
financially in APMs, such as 
capitation, if they understand how 
these models alter practice finances 
and how to calculate the breakeven 
rate and if they take advantage of 
the added flexibility to improve 
efficiency and value. Additional 
work should focus on analyzing 
practices in blended payment 
models and the relationship 
between differing staffing ratios, 
patient panel size, and patient 
outcomes.
