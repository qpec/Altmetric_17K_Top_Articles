Background: A 2007 American College of Physicians guideline
addressed pharmacologic options for low back pain. New evi-
dence and medications have now become available.
Purpose: To review the current evidence on systemic pharma-
cologic therapies for acute or chronic nonradicular or radicular
low back pain.
Data Sources: Ovid MEDLINE (January 2008 through Novem-
ber 2016), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Co-
chrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and reference lists.
Study Selection: Randomized trials that reported pain, func-
tion, or harms of systemic medications versus placebo or an-
other intervention.
Data Extraction: One investigator abstracted data, and a sec-
ond verified accuracy; 2 investigators independently assessed
study quality.
Data Synthesis: The number of trials ranged from 9 (benzodi-
azepines) to 70 (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). New ev-
idence found that acetaminophen was ineffective for acute low
back pain, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs had smaller
benefits for chronic low back pain than previously observed, du-
loxetine was effective for chronic low back pain, and benzodiaz-
epines were ineffective for radiculopathy. For opioids, evidence
remains limited to short-term trials showing modest effects for
chronic low back pain; trials were not designed to assess serious
harms. Skeletal muscle relaxants are effective for short-term pain
relief in acute low back pain but caused sedation. Systemic cor-
ticosteroids do not seem to be effective. For effective interven-
tions, pain relief was small to moderate and generally short-term;
improvements in function were generally smaller. Evidence is
insufficient to determine the effects of antiseizure medications.
Limitations: Qualitatively synthesized new trials with prior meta-
analyses. Only English-language studies were included, many of
which had methodological shortcomings. Medications injected
for local effects were not addressed.
Conclusion: Several systemic medications for low back pain are
associated with small to moderate, primarily short-term effects
on pain. New evidence suggests that acetaminophen is ineffec-
tive for acute low back pain, and duloxetine is associated with
modest effects for chronic low back pain.

L
ow back pain is one of the most frequently encoun-
tered conditions in clinical practice (1, 2). The most
commonly prescribed medications for low back pain
are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
skeletal muscle relaxants, antidepressants, and opioids
(3–5); benzodiazepines, systemic corticosteroids, and
antiseizure medications are also prescribed (3). Patients
often
use
over-the-counter
acetaminophen
and
NSAIDs.
A 2007 guideline (6) and associated systematic re-
view (7) from the American College of Physicians (ACP)
and American Pain Society (APS) found evidence to
support the use of acetaminophen and NSAIDs as first-
line pharmacologic options for low back pain; second-
ary options were skeletal muscle relaxants, benzodiaz-
epines,
and
antidepressants.
New
evidence
and
medications are now available. Here, we review the cur-
rent evidence on benefits and harms of medications for
low back pain. This article has been used by ACP to
update a clinical practice guideline, also in this issue.
METHODS
Detailed methods and data for our review, includ-
ing the analytic framework, additional medications
(topical capsaicin and lidocaine), nonpharmacologic
therapies (addressed in a separate article) (8), search
strategies,
inclusion
criteria,
data
extraction
and
quality-rating methods, and additional outcomes (for
example, quality of life, global improvement, and pa-
tient satisfaction), are available in the full report (9). The
protocol was developed by using a standardized pro-
cess (10) with input from experts and the public and is
registered in the PROSPERO database (11). This article
addresses the key question, what are the comparative
benefits and harms of different systemic pharmacologic
therapies for acute or chronic nonradicular low back
pain, radicular low back pain, or spinal stenosis?

 Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Data-
base of Systematic Reviews (through April 2015). We
used the prior ACP/APS review (12) to identify earlier
studies. Updated searches were performed through
November 2016. We also reviewed reference lists and
searched ClinicalTrials.gov.
Study Selection
Two
investigators
independently
reviewed
ab-
stracts and full-text articles against prespecified eligibil-
ity criteria. The population was adults with nonradicular
or radicular low back pain of any duration (categorized
as acute [<4 weeks], subacute [4 to 12 weeks], and
chronic [≥12 weeks]). Excluded conditions were low
back pain due to cancer, infection, inflammatory ar-
thropathy, high-velocity trauma, or fracture; low back
pain during pregnancy; and presence of severe or pro-
gressive neurologic deficits. We evaluated acetamino-
phen,
NSAIDs,
opioids,
tramadol
and
tapentadol,
antidepressants, skeletal muscle relaxants, benzodiaz-
epines, corticosteroids, and antiseizure medications
versus placebo, no treatment, or other therapies. We
also evaluated the combination of 2 medications versus
1 medication alone. Outcomes were long-term (≥1
year) or short-term (≤6 months) pain or function, mood
(for antidepressants), risk for surgery (for corticoste-
roids), and harms.
Given the large number of medications addressed,
we included systematic reviews of randomized trials
(13, 14). For each medication, we selected the most
recent, most relevant, and highest-quality comprehen-
sive systematic review based on a validated assessment
tool (14, 15). If more than 1 good-quality systematic
review was available, we preferentially selected up-
dates of those used in the ACP/APS review. We supple-
mented systematic reviews with additional trials. Al-
though we did not include systematic reviews identified
in update searches, we checked reference lists for ad-
ditional studies. We excluded non–English-language
articles and abstract-only publications.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
One investigator extracted study data, and a sec-
ond verified accuracy. For systematic reviews, we ab-
stracted details about inclusion criteria, search strategy,
databases searched, search dates, number and charac-
teristics of included studies, quality assessment meth-
ods and ratings, synthesis methods, and results. For
randomized trials, we abstracted details about the set-
ting, sample size, eligibility criteria, population charac-
teristics, treatment characteristics, results, and funding
source.
Two
investigators
independently
assessed
the
quality of each study as good, fair, or poor using criteria
developed by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
(for randomized trials) (16) and AMSTAR (A Measure-
ment Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews) (14).
For primary studies included in systematic reviews,
we used both the quality ratings and the overall grade
(for example, good, fair, or poor, or high or low) as
determined in the reviews.
We classified the magnitude of effects as small/
slight, moderate, or large/substantial based on the def-
initions in the ACP/APS review (Table 1) (6, 17). We also
reported risk estimates based on the proportion of pa-
tients achieving successful pain or function outcomes
(for example, >30% or >50% improvement).
Data Synthesis and Analysis
We synthesized data qualitatively for each medica-
tion, stratified according to the duration of symptoms
(acute, subacute, or chronic) and presence or absence
of radicular symptoms. We reported meta-analysis re-
sults from systematic reviews. When statistical hetero-
geneity was present, we examined the degree of
inconsistency and evaluated subgroup and sensitivity
analyses. We did not conduct an updated meta-analysis;
rather, we qualitatively examined whether results of
new studies were consistent with pooled or qualitative
findings from prior systematic reviews. Qualitative as-
sessments were based on whether the findings from
the new studies were in the same direction as the prior
systematic reviews and whether the magnitude of ef-
fects was similar; when prior meta-analyses were avail-
able, we analyzed whether the estimates and CIs from
new studies were encompassed in the CIs from pooled
estimates. We assessed the strength of evidence (SOE)
for each body of evidence as high, moderate, low, or
insufficient based on aggregate study quality, preci-
sion, consistency, and directness (18).

 Role of the Funding Source
The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
(AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services funded this review. AHRQ staff assisted in de-
veloping the scope and key questions. The AHRQ had
no role in study selection, quality assessment, or
synthesis.
RESULTS
Literature Search
The search and selection of articles are summa-
rized in the Figure. Database searches found 2847 po-
tentially relevant articles. After dual review of abstracts
and titles, we selected 746 articles for full-text dual re-
view; 46 publications met inclusion criteria. Quality rat-
ings are summarized in Supplement Tables 1 and 2
(available at Annals.org).
Acetaminophen
Ten trials evaluated acetaminophen; 9 of these
(sample sizes, 39 to 456) were included in the ACP/APS
review (19). We identified 1 additional large (n = 1643),
good-quality, placebo-controlled trial (20). Six trials
compared acetaminophen with NSAIDs and were in-
cluded in a systematic review of NSAIDs (Supplement
Table 3, available at Annals.org) (21, 22). Along with
the new trial, 3 others (23–25) were rated good- or
high-quality.
For acute low back pain, 1 new trial found no dif-
ferences between 4 weeks or less of scheduled or as-
needed acetaminophen (about 4 g/d) and placebo in
pain (differences, ≤0.20 point on a 0- to 10-point scale),
function (differences, ≤0.60 point on the 0- to 24-point
Roland–Morris Disability Questionnaire [RDQ]), or risk
for serious adverse events (about 1% in each group)
after 12 weeks (Supplement Table 4, available at
Annals.org) (20). One trial of acetaminophen versus no
treatment included in the ACP/APS review (26) also
found no differences.
We found no difference between acetaminophen
and NSAIDs in pain intensity (standardized mean differ-
ence [SMD], 0.21 [95% CI, �0.02 to 0.43]) at 3 weeks or
less based on 3 low-quality trials, although estimates
favored NSAIDs (22). Acetaminophen had a lower risk
for adverse events than NSAIDs (relative risk [RR], 0.57
[CI, 0.36 to 0.89]). Evidence was insufficient to deter-
mine the effects of acetaminophen versus various non-
pharmacologic therapies (24, 27, 28) or amitriptyline
(25); each comparison was evaluated in 1 trial with
methodological
shortcomings.
No
study
evaluated
acetaminophen for chronic or radicular low back pain.
NSAIDs
Seventy trials evaluated NSAIDs; 57 were in the
ACP/APS review. Sixty-five trials (total n = 11 237; sam-
ple sizes, 20 to 690), 28 of which were high-quality,
were included in a systematic review (Supplement Ta-
ble 3) (22). We identified 5 additional trials (n = 54 to
525) (Supplement Table 5, available at Annals.org) (29–
33). One trial was rated good-quality (31), and 4 were
rated fair-quality (29, 30).
For acute back pain, 1 systematic review (22) found
that NSAIDs were associated with greater mean im-
provements in pain intensity than placebo (4 trials:
weighted mean difference, �8.39 points on a 0- to 100-
point scale [CI, �12.68 to �4.10 points]; chi-square
test, 3.47 points; P > 0.10) (34–37). One additional trial
(n = 171) reported consistent findings (29). Three trials
in this review found no differences between an NSAID
and placebo in the likelihood of pain relief (38–40).
Most trials did not report effects on function, although
1 trial (41) found that NSAIDs were associated with
greater improvement on the RDQ than placebo (differ-
ences, 2.4 to 2.9 points; P < 0.001).
For chronic low back pain, 1 systematic review (22)
found that NSAIDs were associated with greater mean
pain relief than placebo after 12 weeks (4 trials:
weighted mean difference, �12.40 points on a 0- to
100-point scale [CI, �15.53 to �9.26 points]; chi-
square test, 1.82 points; P > 0.50). However, 2 trials that
were not included reported smaller effects on pain
(0.41 to 0.59 point after 12 to 16 weeks on a 0- to
10-point scale), although NSAIDs were associated with
an increased likelihood of pain relief versus placebo in
both studies (≥30% pain relief: 56.8% vs. 31.7% and
37.0% vs. 27.0%; P < 0.05 in both studies) (32, 33). Four
trials found that NSAIDs were associated with no to
small effects on the RDQ versus placebo (mean differ-
ences, about 0.02 to 2 points) (32, 33, 42, 43).
For radiculopathy, the ACP/APS review (22) re-
ported small and inconsistent effects on pain from
2 trials (36, 44). Neither study assessed effects on
function.
Evidence was insufficient to determine the effects
of an NSAID plus another intervention versus this inter-
vention alone or an NSAID versus another intervention
(other interventions were a skeletal muscle relaxant,
doloteffin, exercise therapy, and massage) (30, 31, 38,
45). Each comparison was evaluated in only 1 trial with
methodological shortcomings. There were no clear dif-
ferences in pain relief between different NSAIDs for
acute or chronic low back pain (21 and 6 trials, respec-
tively) (22).
The systematic review (22) found that NSAIDs were
associated with more adverse effects than placebo (10
trials: RR, 1.35 [CI, 1.09 to 1.68]), although serious
harms were rare. Cyclooxygenase-2-selective NSAIDs
had a lower risk for adverse effects than nonselective
NSAIDs (4 trials: RR, 0.83 [CI, 0.70 to 0.99]).
Opioids, Tramadol, and Tapentadol
Twenty-seven trials (sample sizes, 21 to 981) evalu-
ated opioids, tramadol (a dual-action analgesic with
weak opioid μ-receptor affinity), or tapentadol (a dual-
action analgesic with strong μ-receptor affinity) versus
placebo or other treatments; 14 were included in the
ACP/APS review and 16 (13 rated low risk of bias) were
reported in a systematic review (Supplement Table 3)
(46). Three trials (1 higher-quality) (47) were included in
the ACP/APS review (47–49). We identified 8 additional
trials (Supplement Table 6, available at Annals.org)
(50–57): 2 good-quality (50, 51), 5 fair-quality (53–57),

 and 1 poor-quality (52). Methodological shortcomings
included high attrition (30% to 60% in most trials), use
of an enriched enrollment randomized withdrawal de-
sign (58) by some trials (47, 52, 56, 57, 59–64), and
short follow-up (maximum of 16 weeks) (48). We also
identified 11 trials that compared opioids. Eight trials
(47, 48, 65–70) were included in a systematic review
(71), but 3 others were not (72–74).
For acute low back pain, 1 trial found no difference
between oxycodone or acetaminophen plus naproxen
(n = 108) and placebo plus naproxen (n = 107) in pain
or function (54).
For chronic low back pain, 1 systematic review (46)
found that strong opioids (morphine, oxymorphone,
hydromorphone, and tapentadol) were associated with
greater short-term relief than placebo for pain (6 trials:
SMD, �0.43 [CI, �0.52 to �0.33]; I2 = 0.0%; mean dif-
ference, about 1 point on a 0- to 10-point pain scale)
and function (4 trials: SMD, �0.26 [CI. �0.37 to �0.15];
I2 = 0.0%; mean difference, about 1 point on the RDQ);
4 additional trials (47, 50, 52, 56) reported consistent
results. Tramadol also resulted in greater short-term re-
lief than placebo for pain (5 trials: SMD, �0.55 [CI,
�0.66 to �0.44]; I2 = 86%; mean difference, ≤1 point
on a 0- to 10-point pain scale) and function (5 trials:
SMD, �0.18 [CI, �0.29 to �0.07]; I2 = 0%; mean differ-
ence, about 1 point on the RDQ); 2 additional trials (51,
53) reported consistent results. Two trials found that
buprenorphine patches were associated with greater
short-term pain relief (about 1 point on a 0- to 10-point
scale) than placebo patches, with inconsistent effects
on function (63, 75–77); 1 additional trial (57) of buccal
buprenorphine reported consistent results. Three trials
in this review (46) reported inconsistent effects of opi-
oids versus NSAIDs for pain relief (48, 78); 1 of the trials
(48) found no difference in function.
The review (46) found that opioids had a higher risk
for nausea, dizziness, constipation, vomiting, somno-
lence, and dry mouth than placebo. Trials were not de-
signed to assess long-term harms or the risk for over-
dose, abuse, or addiction.
For symptomatic spinal stenosis, a small (n = 21)
trial
found
no
differences
between
single-dose
immediate-release oxymorphone and placebo in pain,
function, or other outcomes (55).
Four trials found no clear differences among vari-
ous long-acting opioids in pain or function (47, 65, 66,

 long- and short-acting opioids in pain (48, 67–70,73).
Although some trials found long-acting opioids associ-
ated with greater pain relief, patients randomly as-
signed to these drugs also received higher doses.
Skeletal Muscle Relaxants
Twenty-five trials (sample sizes, 20 to 562) evalu-
ated skeletal muscle relaxants; 22 (17 high-quality)
were included in a systematic review (Supplement Ta-
ble 3) (79) used in the ACP/APS review. We identified 3
additional fair-quality trials (Supplement Table 7, avail-
able at Annals.org) (54, 80, 81).
For acute low back pain, the systematic review (79)
found skeletal muscle relaxants superior to placebo for
short-term pain relief (≥2-point or 30% improvement
on a 0- to 10-point visual analogue scale [VAS]) after 2
to 4 days (4 trials: RR, 1.25 [CI, 1.12 to 1.41]; I2 = 0%)
and 5 to 7 days (3 trials: RR, 1.72 [CI, 1.32 to 2.22]; I2 =
0%) (79). An additional trial (n = 562) reported consis-
tent findings (81). Evidence was insufficient to deter-
mine effects on function, which most trials did not re-
port. Compared with placebo, skeletal muscle relaxants
were associated with increased risk for any adverse
event (8 trials: RR, 1.50 [CI, 1.14 to 1.98]) and central
nervous system events (primarily sedation) (8 trials: RR,
2.04 [CI, 1.23 to 3.37]; I2 = 50%) (79).
Evidence was insufficient from 3 small placebo-
controlled trials with inconsistent results and method-
ological shortcomings to determine the effects of skel-
etal muscle relaxants on chronic low back pain (82–84).
Four trials showed inconsistent effects of a skeletal
muscle relaxant plus an NSAID versus an NSAID alone
(54, 79, 80). Although estimates from 3 trials favored
the combination for effects on pain intensity, the fourth
trial found no effects on pain or function (54). Three
trials in the review (79) found no differences among
various skeletal muscle relaxants on any outcome
(85–87).
Benzodiazepines
Nine trials (sample sizes, 30 to 152) evaluated ben-
zodiazepines; 8 of these trials (5 high-quality) were in-
cluded in a systematic review (79) used in the ACP/APS
review (Supplement Table 3). The ninth, a good-quality
trial (n = 60) (Supplement Table 8, available at Annals
.org), evaluated benzodiazepines for radicular pain
(88).
For acute nonradicular low back pain, 2 trials re-
ported inconsistent effects of benzodiazepines versus
placebo (89, 90); the higher-quality trial (n = 50) (89)
found no difference between diazepam and placebo in
the likelihood of reduced pain and tenderness at 5
days (76% vs. 72%; RR, 1.06 [CI, 0.76 to 1.47]). For
chronic nonradicular low back pain, 2 high-quality trials
(n = 50 and 152) (91, 92) found tetrazepam associated
with a lower likelihood of no improvement in pain at 5
to 7 days (RR, 0.82 [CI, 0.72 to 0.94]) and 10 to 14 days
(RR, 0.71 [CI, 0.54 to 0.93]) than placebo. Evidence was
inconsistent from 2 trials on the effects of benzodiaz-
epines versus skeletal muscle relaxants (93, 94).
The new trial found no difference in function be-
tween diazepam, 5 mg 3 times daily, and placebo for
acute radiculopathy (median improvement on the RDQ
at 1 week, 3.0 vs. 5.0 points [P = 0.67]; median im-
provement on the RDQ at 1 year, 2 vs. 1 point) (88).
Diazepam was less likely to be associated with pain re-
lief of 50% or greater at 1 week (41% vs. 79%; RR, 0.5
[CI, 0.3 to 0.8]).
A systematic review (79) found that compared with
placebo,
benzodiazepines
were
associated
with
greater risk for central nervous system adverse events,
such as somnolence, fatigue, and lightheadedness, al-
though harms were not well-reported. No trial was de-
signed
to
evaluate
risk
for
addiction,
abuse,
or
overdose.
Antidepressants
Sixteen trials (n = 16 to 404) evaluated antidepres-
sants; 7 were used in the ACP/APS review, and 10 trials
(7 high-quality) were included in a systematic review
(Supplement Table 3) (95). We identified 6 additional
trials
(Supplement
Table
9,
available
at
Annals
.org): 1 good-quality (96), 3 fair-quality (97–99), and 2
poor-quality (100, 101). Two trials required patients to
have depression and low back pain (102, 103). No trial
evaluated antidepressants for acute low back pain.
For chronic low back pain, a systematic review (95)
found no difference in pain between tricyclic antide-
pressants (4 trials: SMD, �0.10 [CI, �0.51 to 0.31]; I2 =
32%) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (3 trials:
SMD, 0.11 [CI, �0.17 to 0.39]; I2 = 0%) and placebo.
Antidepressants were not associated with reduced de-
pression (SMD, 0.06 [CI, �0.29 to 0.40]; I2 = 0%) or
improved function (SMD, �0.06 [CI, �0.40 to 0.29]; I2 =
0%), but each outcome was evaluated in only 2 trials.
Three trials not in that review found that the sero-
tonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor duloxetine, 60
mg/d, was associated with lower pain intensity at 12 to
13 weeks, although effects were small (differences,
0.60 to 0.79 point on the 0- to 10-point Brief Pain In-
ventory severity scale) (96–98). One trial of duloxetine
also found an increased likelihood of 50% or greater
pain relief after 12 weeks (49% vs. 35%; RR, 1.41 [CI,
1.11 to 1.78]) (97). All 3 trials found that duloxetine was
associated with greater improvement in function than
placebo on the Brief Pain Inventory interference scale
(mean between-group difference, 0.58 to 0.74 point),
but 1 trial found no difference on the RDQ (mean
change from baseline, �2.69 vs. �2.22 points; P =
0.26) (97). There were no differences between dulox-
etine and placebo in the risk for serious adverse events
(96–98), although duloxetine was associated with in-
creased risk for withdrawal due to adverse events (3
trials: odds ratio, 2.72 [CI, 1.74 to 4.24]; I2 = 0%). Du-
loxetine was associated with increased risk for nausea
(P < 0.05).
Evidence to directly compare serotonin norepi-
nephrine reuptake inhibitors with other antidepressants
was very limited. One fair-quality trial (n = 85) found no
differences between duloxetine and escitalopram (a se-
lective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) in pain or function
(96, 99). One small trial (n = 25) provided insufficient

 evidence to determine the effects of duloxetine for ra-
dicular pain (101).
Antiseizure Medications
Twelve trials (n = 29 to 309) evaluated antiseizure
medications; 4 (104–107) were reported in the ACP/
APS review (Supplement Table 3). We identified 8 ad-
ditional trials (Supplement Table 10, available at Annals
.org)
(108–115).
Seven
of
these
(108–113,
115)
evaluated pregabalin and 1 (114) evaluated gabapen-
tin. Of the 12 antiseizure medication trials, 6 (106, 108,
109, 111–113) were rated fair-quality and 6 (104, 105,
107, 110, 114, 115) were rated poor-quality.
No trial evaluated antiseizure medications for acute
low back pain. For chronic nonradicular back pain, 2
fair-quality trials found that pregabalin was associated
with no effects on pain intensity versus placebo (differ-
ences, 0.14 to 0.21 point on a 0- to 10-point scale) (108,
111). One trial found no effect on function on the Os-
westry Disability Index (ODI) (108), and the other found
that pregabalin had slightly worse scores on the RDQ
(13 vs. 11 points; P = 0.01) (111). Evidence was insuffi-
cient to determine adverse effects of topiramate or
pregabalin versus placebo because of inconsistent
findings.
For chronic radicular back pain, 3 poor-quality tri-
als reported inconsistent findings for gabapentin (dose
titrated up to 1200 to 3600 mg/d) versus placebo (105,
107, 114). Effects on pain intensity ranged from 0.3 to
1.9 points on a 0- to 10-point scale. One fair-quality and
1 poor-quality trial reported inconsistent effects of topi-
ramate, with small to moderate effects on some mea-
sures of pain (104, 106); no effects on leg pain or the
ODI were reported in 1 of the trials (106).
Evidence was insufficient from single trials with
methodological shortcomings to determine the effects
of pregabalin versus other medications (110, 113, 115)
or pregabalin plus another medication versus the other
medication alone (109, 112, 113).
Systemic Corticosteroids
Ten trials (sample size, 29 to 269) evaluated sys-
temic corticosteroids; 4 (116–119) were included in the
ACP/APS review (Supplement Table 3). We identified 6
additional trials (Supplement Table 11, available at
Annals.org) (120–125). Treatment ranged from a single
dose to a 21-day course; corticosteroid doses varied.
Eight trials evaluated patients with radiculopathy; of
these, 3 (116, 124, 125) required imaging correlation.
Four trials (116, 117, 121, 125) were rated good-
quality, 5 fair-quality (118–120, 122, 124), and 1 poor-
quality (123).
For acute nonradicular low back pain, 2 trials (n =
86 and 67) found no differences between a single in-
tramuscular injection or a 5-day course of systemic cor-
ticosteroids and placebo in pain or function (117, 120).
For spinal stenosis, 1 trial (n = 61) found no differences
through 12 weeks of follow-up between a 3-week
course of prednisone and placebo in pain intensity or
the RDQ (124). No trial evaluated systemic corticoste-
roids for chronic nonradicular pain.
For radicular low back pain of varying duration, 6
trials consistently found no differences between sys-
temic corticosteroids and placebo in pain (116, 118,
119, 121, 123, 125). For function, the largest (n = 269)
good-quality trial found that systemic corticosteroids
were associated with small effects (difference in ODI at
52 weeks, 7.4 [CI, 2.2 to 12.5]) (125), but 2 other trials
found no effects (121, 123). Two trials found no effects
of systemic corticosteroids on the likelihood of spine
surgery (116, 125).
In the largest trial, oral prednisone (initial dose, 60
mg/d) increased risk for any adverse event (49% vs.
24%; P < 0.001), insomnia (26% vs. 10%; P = 0.003),
nervousness (18% vs. 8.0%; P = 0.03), and increased
appetite (22% vs. 10%; P = 0.02) (125). A smaller (n =
39) trial found that a tapering course of intramuscular
dexamethasone (initial dose, 64 mg/d) was associated
with increased risk for any adverse effect (32% vs. 5.0%;
RR, 6.32 [CI, 0.84 to 47.7]), but there were no withdraw-
als due to adverse events (122). Serious harms were not
reported in any trial, but harms were not well-reported
in some trials.

 observed for short-term (generally <3 months) pain
and were small (5 to 10 points on a 100-point VAS) to
moderate (10 to 20 points), based on the ACP/APS cat-
egories (19). Function was reported less consistently
than pain, and effects were typically smaller or not ob-
served. Evidence on other outcomes (for example,
quality of life, mood, work, analgesic use, or health care
use) was sparse and is described in the full report (9).
As in the ACP/APS review, evidence on pharmacologic
therapies for radiculopathy was very limited (Table 4).
The SOE ratings are summarized in Supplement Table
14 (available at Annals.org).
New evidence affected findings for several medica-
tions. The ACP/APS review concluded that acetamino-
phen was effective for acute low back pain, primarily
based on trials showing similar effectiveness of acet-
aminophen compared with NSAIDs. However, the first
large, well-conducted, placebo-controlled trial found
that acetaminophen was ineffective for acute low back
pain (low SOE) (20). Newer trials reported that NSAIDs
had smaller benefits than placebo for chronic low back
pain than previously observed (32, 33). For antidepres-
sants, several trials found duloxetine, a serotonin nor-
epinephrine reuptake inhibitor introduced after the
prior ACP/APS review, to be more effective than pla-
cebo for chronic low back pain, although effects were
small (moderate SOE) (96–98). Previous reviews found
that tricyclic antidepressants were modestly effective
for chronic low back pain; however, a meta-analysis
with newer trials found no differences versus placebo
(moderate SOE) (95). For antiseizure medications, new
placebo-controlled trials on pregabalin for radicular
low back pain are available but had methodological
shortcomings and reported inconsistent results (insuffi-
cient SOE) (108, 111). A recent trial on radiculopathy
found that compared with placebo, benzodiazepines
were associated with no difference in function but more
pain (low SOE) (88).
Other conclusions were relatively unchanged. Skel-
etal muscle relaxants relieved short-term acute low
back pain but caused sedation (moderate SOE). Sys-
temic corticosteroids do not seem to be effective for
radicular or nonradicular low back pain in improving
pain (moderate SOE), although a recent trial reported
small effects on function (125). Evidence on benzodiaz-
epines for nonradicular back pain remains sparse (in-
sufficient SOE) (23). For opioids, evidence remains lim-
ited to short-term trials showing modest effects versus
placebo for chronic low back pain (moderate SOE) (46).
Trials were not designed to assess the risk for overdose
or opioid use disorder because of relatively small sam-
ples, short follow-up, and exclusion of higher-risk pa-
tients; in addition, many studies used an enriched en-
rollment randomized withdrawal design, which could

 underestimate harms (58). Observational studies have
found an association between prescribed opioids and
serious harms, such as overdose (126), and clinical
guidelines recommend risk assessment, careful patient
selection, use of lower doses, and close monitoring and
follow-up of patients prescribed these drugs (127). For
nonopioid medications, serious harms were generally
not observed, although the studies were not designed
to assess uncommon or longer-term harms.
Relatively few studies compared the effectiveness
of different medications for low back pain or a combi-
nation of 2 medications versus 1 medication alone.
There were no clear differences between opioids and
NSAIDs, benzodiazepines and skeletal muscle relax-
ants, or acetaminophen and NSAIDs.
We categorized the magnitude of effects for pain
and function using the thresholds in the ACP/APS re-
view (Table 1). Effects that were classified as small (for
example, 5 to 10 points on a 0- to 100-point scale for
pain or function) are below some of the proposed
thresholds for the minimum clinically important differ-
ence (for example, 15 points on a 0- to 100-point VAS
for pain, 2 points on a 0- to 10-point numerical rating
scale for pain or function, 5 points on the RDQ, and 10
points on the ODI) (17). Factors that may support the
use of interventions associated with small effects in-
clude low risk for harms, low costs, or strong patient
preferences; in addition, some patients will have
greater-than-average effects. The magnitude of effects
might vary depending on baseline severity (128); most
trials enrolled patients with at least moderate pain (for
example, >5 points on a 0- to 10-point numerical rating
scale).
Our findings have implications for clinical practice.
Guidelines currently recommend acetaminophen as a
first-line option for acute and chronic low back pain (6,
129). The use of opioids for chronic pain has become
an area of increasing concern (130). Since the ACP/APS
guideline was published, the antidepressant duloxetine
has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Admin-
istration for low back pain and seems to be more effec-
tive and safer than tricyclic antidepressants.
Our review has limitations. Reviewing all primary
literature was not feasible because of the large number
of medications addressed. We included higher-quality,
recent systematic reviews that were most relevant to
the scope of our review (131), supplemented with ad-
ditional primary trials. Although we did not update
meta-analyses reported in systematic reviews, we eval-
uated the consistency of results from new trials against
prior pooled estimates. We excluded non–English-
language articles and did not search for abstract-only
publications. Some systematic reviews that we used in-
cluded such articles but did not affect our conclusions.
Our ability to assess for publication bias was limited
because of methodological limitations in the trials and
study heterogeneity and because few trials were avail-
able for many comparisons. Although we did not in-
clude new or updated systematic reviews identified in
update searches (132–134), we used these searches to
identify additional trials. Our findings were generally
concordant with new reviews. We did not evaluate the
effectiveness of medications injected for local effects;
epidural steroid injections were recently reviewed else-
where (135).
The evidence base has limitations. Effects on pain
and function were typically reported as mean differ-
ences. Few studies reported the likelihood of clinically
significant improvements (136). Data were sparse for
several medications, and many studies had method-
ological flaws. Some studies did not clearly describe
important patient characteristics, such as the duration
of symptoms, presence of radiculopathy, or use of co-
interventions. Older adults were underrepresented,
and most antidepressant trials excluded or included
few patients with depression (95). Therefore, evidence
to determine how medication effectiveness varies in im-
portant subgroups is lacking. Most studies were funded
by industry. For example, all placebo-controlled trials
of duloxetine for nonradicular low back pain were
funded by the manufacturer and nearly all trials of opi-
oids were industry-funded.
More research is needed to determine effective
treatments for radicular low back pain. Trials with
longer-term follow-up are needed to help understand
whether benefits are sustained. Studies are particularly
needed on the long-term effectiveness and harms of
opioids for chronic low back pain in clinically represen-
tative populations. More research is also needed to
better understand whether combining medications is
associated with incremental benefits and which combi-
nations and sequences of medications are the most ef-
fective. Trials should routinely assess important out-
comes, such as mood, quality of life, return to work,
and health care use, and more consistently and rigor-
ously evaluate and report harms.
In conclusion, several systemic pharmacologic ther-
apies for low back pain are associated with small to
moderate, primarily short-term effects on pain. Effects
on function were generally smaller than effects on pain.
New evidence suggests that acetaminophen is ineffec-
tive for acute low back pain and that duloxetine is as-
sociated with modest effects for chronic low back pain.
More research is needed to understand the optimal se-
lection of medications, the best combinations and se-
quencing of treatments, and the most effective medica-
tions for radicular low back pain.
