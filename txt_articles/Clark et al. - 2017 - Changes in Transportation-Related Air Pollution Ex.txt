BACKGROUND: Disparities in exposure to air pollution by race-ethnicity and by socioeconomic status have been documented in the United States, but
the impacts of declining transportation-related air pollutant emissions on disparities in exposure have not been studied in detail.
OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to estimate changes over time (2000 to 2010) in disparities in exposure to outdoor concentrations of a
transportation-related air pollutant, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), in the United States.
METHODS: We combined annual average NO2 concentration estimates from a temporal land use regression model with Census demographic data to
estimate outdoor exposures by race-ethnicity, socioeconomic characteristics (income, age, education), and by location (region, state, county, urban
area) for the contiguous United States in 2000 and 2010.
RESULTS: Estimated annual average NO2 concentrations decreased from 2000 to 2010 for all of the race-ethnicity and socioeconomic status groups,
including a decrease from 17:6 ppb to 10:7 ppb (−6:9 ppb) in nonwhite [non-(white alone, non-Hispanic)] populations, and 12:6 ppb to 7:8 ppb
(−4:7 ppb) in white (white alone, non-Hispanic) populations. In 2000 and 2010, disparities in NO2 concentrations were larger by race-ethnicity than
by income. Although the national nonwhite–white mean NO2 concentration disparity decreased from a difference of 5:0 ppb in 2000 to 2:9 ppb in
2010, estimated mean NO2 concentrations remained 37% higher for nonwhites than whites in 2010 (40% higher in 2000), and nonwhites were 2.5
times more likely than whites to live in a block group with an average NO2 concentration above the WHO annual guideline in 2010 (3.0 times more
likely in 2000).
CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that absolute NO2 exposure disparities by race-ethnicity decreased from 2000 to 2010, but relative NO2 exposure dis-
parities persisted, with higher NO2 concentrations for nonwhites than whites in 2010. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP959
Introduction
Environmental injustice describes conditions in which more vul-
nerable communities experience disproportionate burdens of
environmental health risks, such as exposure to air pollution.
Environmental injustice in air pollution has been widely docu-
mented in the United States: many (>140) studies, covering a
range of pollutants and U.S. locations, found higher air pollution
exposures for lower-income groups and/or for race-ethnicity mi-
nority groups (Marshall et al. 2014). A key knowledge gap is
whether environmental injustice has changed over time in the
United States (Mohai and Saha 2015; Hajat et al. 2015).
Longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate impacts of environ-
mental policies on equity (Bento et al. 2015; Post et al. 2011), to
explore the underlying causes of environmental injustice (Pastor
et al. 2001), to enable tracking of environmental justice outcomes
over time (Payne-Sturges and Gee 2006), and to test relationships
between health disparities and exposure disparities over time
(Mohai et al. 2009).
The goal of the present study was to estimate changes over
time in environmental injustice in exposure to outdoor concen-
trations of a transportation-related air pollutant (TRAP) for
the
contiguous
United
States.
Previous
studies
explored
environmental injustice aspects of distributions of benefits
(e.g., accessibility) and costs (e.g., noise) of transportation
(Schweitzer and Valenzuela 2004). We focused on exposure to
air pollution as a cost of transportation emissions that often dif-
fers by race-ethnicity and/or socioeconomic status in the United
States. Racial minorities and low-income households are dis-
proportionately likely to live near a major road [e.g., 27% of
racial minorities vs. 19% of the total population lived near high
traffic volume roads in the United States in 2010 (based on an
analysis of national census and traffic data; Rowangould
2013)], where TRAP concentrations are typically highest (e.g.,
nitrogen dioxide concentrations were on average 2.9 times
higher near major roads than urban background levels [based on
a synthesis of monitoring studies in multiple cities; Karner et al.
2010]).
Previous U.S.-based longitudinal air pollution environmental
justice studies have focused on exposure to industrial air pollu-
tion or proximity to polluting industrial facilities. Ard (2015)
studied annual average concentrations of industrial air pollution
nationwide
during
1995–2004
and
found
that
exposures
decreased for all race-ethnicity groups over time, but African
Americans remained more exposed than whites and Hispanics
(by a factor of ∼ 50%). Longitudinal case studies on residential
proximity to polluting industrial facilities [e.g., Seattle, 1990–
2007 (Abel and White 2011); southern California, 1990–2000
(Hipp and Lakon 2010); in a national cohort, 1990–2007 (Pais
et al. 2014)] found that race-ethnicity minority groups and/or
lower socioeconomic status groups experienced closer average
proximity to industrial facilities compared with other groups, and
this pattern persisted over time. Few U.S.-based studies have
explored temporal trends in environmental injustice for ambient
air pollution or for transportation-related air pollution. Brajer and
Hall (2005), studying ozone and coarse particulate matter in
southern California during 1990–1999, found that on average, as
air
pollution
decreased
over
time,
Asians
and
Hispanics

Research
 experienced larger reductions in ozone concentrations but smaller
reductions in coarse particulate matter concentrations, compared
with other groups. Kravitz-Wirtz et al. (2016), studying nitrogen
dioxide and particulate matter exposures in the United States for
a cohort of ∼ 9,000 families during 1990–2009, found that as
exposures decreased over time, exposures remained higher for
blacks and Hispanics than for whites.
We focused on nitrogen dioxide (NO2) as a TRAP.
Transportation sources accounted for an estimated 60% of
anthropogenic NOx emissions in the United States in 2010 (U.S.
EPA 2016), and NO2 is an indicator of local transportation-
related emissions (Brook et al. 2007; Burnett et al. 2004; Levy
et al. 2014) with high within-urban spatial variability (Hewitt
1991; Apte et al. 2017). The U.S. EPA regulates outdoor annual
NO2 as one of six criteria pollutants, in part because exposure to
NO2 (together with other co-emitted TRAPs) is associated with
health impacts, including low birth weight (Brauer et al. 2008),
asthma in children (Takenoue et al. 2012), and cardiovascular
mortality (Jerrett et al. 2013).
Air quality improved substantially in the United States after
the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990). From 2000 to 2010, estimated annual anthropogenic
NOx emissions in the United States decreased by ∼ 50% (U.S.
EPA 2016). It is unknown to what extent these estimated
emission-reductions impacted NO2 exposure disparities by race-
ethnicity and by socioeconomic status. To investigate, we com-
bined NO2 air pollution data from a spatially precise (Census
block scale) temporal land use regression model (Bechle et al.
2015) with Census demographic data (MPC 2011) and then
estimated changes in TRAP environmental injustice over a dec-
ade (2000 to 2010) for the contiguous United States.
Methods
Study Area and Time Points
Analyses covered the contiguous United States (48 states plus the
District of Columbia; selected based on availability of air pollu-
tion data) for two time points (selected based on availability of
decennial Census demographic data): year 2000 (population: 280
million) and year 2010 (population: 306 million).
Datasets
Air pollution data. Air pollution estimates were annual average
NO2 concentrations for 2000 and 2010. These values were from
a monthly land use regression (LUR) model incorporating
satellite-based and ground-based observations (Bechle et al.
2015) for Census blocks [in 2010, n = 8:2 million; mean area =
0:97 km2 (total), 0:048 km2 (urban), 1:8 km2 (rural)].
Demographic data. Demographic data were population esti-
mates from the Census by race-ethnicity, socioeconomic status, lan-
guage, and age. Demographic data included race (seven categories:
white alone, black or African American alone, Asian alone, Native
Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander alone, American Indian or
Alaska Native alone, other race alone, two or more races), ethnicity
(two categories: Hispanic, non-Hispanic), per capita income (contin-
uous variable), household income [five categories (approximate an-
nual household income quintiles): <$20,000, $20,000–$35,000,
$35,000–$50,000, $50,000–$75,000, >$75,000], poverty (two cat-
egories: below poverty level, at or above poverty level), highest
level of education for population >25 y (five categories: less
than high school degree, high school degree, some college, col-
lege degree, graduate degree), employment for population >16 y
(two categories: employed, unemployed), household language
(five categories: English only, Spanish, other Indo-European
language, Asian language, other language), household linguistic
isolation [two categories: linguistically isolated (no one >14 y
speaks English “well” or “very well”), not linguistically iso-
lated], and age [four categories: younger children (<5 y), older
children (5–18 y), younger adults (18–65 y), older adults
(>65 y)]. Demographic data for 2000 were from the Decennial
Census (2000 estimated populations for all demographic charac-
teristics) and for 2010 were from the decennial Census (2010
estimated populations by race-ethnicity and by age) and the
American Community Survey (2008–2012 five-year estimated
populations for all other demographic characteristics not reported
in the 2010 decennial Census) at the Census block group level
[in 2010, n = 210,000 (total); area mean ðinterquartile rangeÞ =
36 km2 (0:49 km2–9:1 km2) (total); 1:1 km2 (0:34 km2–1:3 km2)
(urban); 200 km2 (32 km2–150 km2) (rural)], the finest spatial
scale for which detailed Census data are publicly available.
Spatial and Temporal Matching of Air Pollution and
Demographic Data
To match the air pollution data (block level) with demographic
data (block group level), we calculated population-weighted
mean annual NO2 concentrations for all block centroids within
each block group boundary, for 2000 and 2010. Boundaries for
Census urban areas (defined based on population, population
density, land cover, and other criteria; U.S. Census Bureau
2011) and boundaries for smaller Census geographies (blocks
and block groups) changed during 2000 to 2010. For analyses
comparing consistent block group boundaries over time, we
applied the National Historic Geographic Information System
time-series data: estimates of 2000 population counts and race-
ethnicity within 2010 block group boundaries (MPC 2011). To
match urban area data over time, we applied the 2010 urban
area definitions to both 2000 and 2010 block groups, including
block groups for which all blocks were inside the urban area
boundary.
Urban and Rural Block Group Definitions
For urban versus rural comparisons, we applied the following
definitions based on 2010 Census urban definitions: urban block
groups contain only urban blocks (65%; n = 140,000 in 2010), ru-
ral block groups contain only rural blocks (13%; n = 28,000 in
2010), and mixed block groups contain both urban and rural
blocks (22%; n = 47,000 in 2010).
Exposure Assessment
Exposure assessment was based on residential block group LUR
estimates of outdoor annual average NO2 concentrations.
Analyses Estimating Changes in NO2 Environmental
Injustice over Time
We applied three related approaches to estimating changes in
NO2 environmental injustice over time: a) we estimated and
compared NO2 concentrations for populations defined by demo-
graphic characteristics (e.g., race-ethnicity groups); b) we esti-
mated and compared NO2 concentrations for block groups (as
proxies for “neighborhoods” or “local areas”) by demographic
characteristics (e.g., per capita income); and c) we estimated and
compared NO2 environmental injustice metrics on a national ba-
sis and for regions, states, counties, and urban areas.
Estimated changes in NO2 concentrations by demographic
groups. Our analyses by demographic groups focused on catego-
ries of race-ethnicity (14 groups), age (4 groups), household
income (5 groups), and educational attainment (5 groups). We

 also performed analyses with race-ethnicity dichotomized as
“white” or “nonwhite,” where the white population was defined as
the race-ethnicity majority group (i.e., the “white alone, non-
Hispanic” population; 69% of population in 2000, 64% in 2010),
and the nonwhite population included all other race-ethnicity
minority groups combined (i.e., the non-“white alone, non-
Hispanic” population). In addition, we performed supplemental
analyses of populations by household primary language and linguis-
tic isolation (combined, 13 groups), employment status (unem-
ployed, employed), and poverty (below or above poverty level). For
all analyses by demographic groups, we conducted analyses for the
total population, and separately for the urban and rural populations.
We estimated the population-weighted mean annual NO2 con-
centration C for each demographic group j in each year t (2000
or 2010) as
Cj =
Pn
i= 1 cipij
Pn
i= 1 pij
[1]
where ci is the annual mean NO2 concentration for block group i,
pji is the population of demographic group j in block group i, and
n is the total number of block groups.
To compare population-weighted mean NO2 concentrations
between demographic groups j1 and j2 in year t (cross-sectional
comparisons), we estimated absolute differences as Cj1 − Cj2, and
relative percent differences as f100ðCj1 − Cj2Þ=½ðCj1 + Cj2Þ=2�g.
To compare population-weighted mean NO2 concentrations
between 2000 (t1) and 2010 (t2) for group j (temporal compari-
sons), we estimated the absolute change as Ct2 − Ct1, and the rela-
tive percent change as f100ðCt2 − Ct1Þ=½ðCt2 + Ct1Þ=2�g. Changes
were calculated such that negative values indicate a decrease in
NO2 concentration over time.
Estimated changes in NO2 concentrations by block group
demographic characteristics. To quantify differences by local
(i.e., block group) demographic characteristics, we compared
estimated mean NO2 concentrations in each year between block
groups with proportions of nonwhite residents in the highest and
lowest 5% of the distribution for all block groups in the United
States in each year. We analyzed data for all block groups com-
bined and separately for urban and rural block groups.
To explore block group differences in NO2 concentrations by
race-ethnicity, income, and size of urban area, we categorized
urban block groups by percent nonwhite in each year (quintiles),
average per capita income in 2010 (20 equal groups), and total
urban area population in 2010 (tertiles; large: 4.2 million to 18
million residents, n = 8, total population = 61 million; medium:
830,000 to 3.8 million residents, n = 35, total population =
63 million; and small: 14,000 to 800,000 residents, n = 438,
total population = 61 million). We then compared estimated mean
NO2 concentrations according to average per capita income (by
approximate interquartile range in 2010 per capita income:
$18,000 to $33,000) between urban block groups with percent
nonwhite populations in the highest and lowest quintile of the
national distribution for each year, after stratifying by small, me-
dium, or large urban area population size.
Estimated changes in NO2 environmental injustice metrics.
To quantify how environmental injustice has changed over
time on a national basis and for different U.S. geographies, we
calculated and compared environmental injustice metrics in
2000 and 2010 on a national basis and by region, state, county,
and urban area. Our core environmental injustice metric is the
difference in estimated population-weighted mean NO2 con-
centration (Equation 1) for nonwhites versus whites [i.e., (pop-
ulation-weighted mean NO2 concentration for nonwhites) −
(population-weighted mean NO2 concentration for whites)],
hereafter referred to as the “nonwhite–white NO2 disparity.” As
supplements to the nonwhite–white NO2 disparity, we calculated
alternate environmental injustice metrics by race-ethnicity {for
the three largest minority race-ethnicity groups: black–white
NO2 disparity [difference in estimated population-weighted mean
NO2 concentration for non-Hispanic blacks and non-Hispanic
whites], Hispanic–white NO2 disparity [difference in estimated
population-weighted mean NO2 concentration for Hispanics of any
race(s) and non-Hispanic whites], and Asian–white NO2 disparity
[difference in estimated population-weighted mean NO2 concentra-
tion for non-Hispanic Asians and non-Hispanic whites]} and by
income (difference in estimated population-weighted mean NO2
concentration for the population with income below the poverty
level and the population with income two times the poverty level).
We calculated correlations (Pearson’s correlation coefficient;
Spearman’s rank coefficient) among the changes in the alternate
environmental injustice metrics for states, counties, and urban
areas.
Potential Influence of Changes in NO2 Emissions and
Changes in Demographic Patterns to Changes in
Environmental Injustice over Time
As a preliminary step in understanding underlying mechanisms for
changes over time in TRAP environmental injustice, we explored
potential contributions of two factors: emission-reductions and resi-
dential demographic patterns. To estimate the potential extent to
which each factor separately contributed to changes in NO2 envi-
ronmental injustice, we considered two counterfactual scenarios
with the following assumptions: a) NO2 concentrations changed as
observed (from 2000 to 2010), but residential demographic patterns
remained constant (at year-2000 values); and b) residential demo-
graphic patterns changed as observed (from 2000 to 2010), but NO2
concentrations remained constant (at year-2000 values). We then
calculated the core national environmental injustice metric (non-
white–white NO2 disparity) for each scenario. To estimate the
contribution of changes in NO2 concentrations alone, we divided
the predicted change in the national nonwhite–white NO2 dispar-
ity calculated under counterfactual scenario a by the observed
change in the national nonwhite–white NO2 disparity. To esti-
mate the contribution of changes in residential demographic pat-
terns alone, we divided the change in national nonwhite–white
NO2 disparity calculated under counterfactual scenario b by the
observed change in the nonwhite–white NO2 disparity.
Potential Relevance of Changes in Environmental Injustice
for Public Health
As a preliminary step to explore the potential health relevance of
the observed gaps in NO2 exposures, we a) compared estimated
exposures to health-based air quality guidelines and b) conducted
an illustrative (“back-of-the-envelope”) health impact calculation.
We compared the proportion of nonwhites versus whites living in
block groups with NO2 concentrations above the WHO annual
guideline [>40 lg=m3 (corresponds approximately to >21 ppb)
NO2; WHO 2005] and below 50% of the WHO guideline
(<11 ppb). [All block groups were below the U.S. EPA annual
standard for NO2 (53 ppb) in 2000 and 2010.] We estimated poten-
tial health impacts for one outcome [ischemic heart disease (IHD)
mortality, the most common cause of death in the United States
(CDC 2015)] attributable to the difference in national mean NO2
concentration for nonwhites and whites in 2000 and 2010. We
assumed the relative risk (RR) of IHD mortality associated with out-
door annual average NO2 concentration was 1.066 [95% confidence
interval (CI): 1.015, 1.119] per 4:1 ppb NO2 (based on a cohort of
74,000 adults in California during 1982–2000; Jerrett et al. 2013).
Environmental Health Perspectives
097012-3
 Relative risks (RR) for NO2 concentrations experienced by non-
whites and whites were calculated using: RR = exp ðbCÞ, where C
is the population-weighted mean NO2 concentration (Equation 1),
and b = lnð1:066Þ=ð4:1 ppbÞ = 0:0156 ppb−1. To obtain a simplified
estimate that reflects only the estimated potential impact of changes
in NO2 exposure over time experienced on average by nonwhites
and whites (all else equal), our health risk calculations assumed that
the underlying IHD mortality rate was constant over time [using the
year-2011 estimate: 109 deaths per 100,000 (CDC 2012), although
IHD mortality rates decreased during this time period in the United
States (Finegold et al. 2013; WHO 2016)], and that the underlying
mortality rate was the same for nonwhites and whites and the same
by U.S. location [although IHD mortality rates differed by race-
ethnicity and by U.S. location during this time period (CDC 2016)].
Sensitivity Analyses on Uncertainty in NO2 LUR
Model Estimates
To assess the potential impact of exposure misclassification on
our findings, we tested whether NO2 LUR model residuals
showed systematic bias with respect to demographic characteris-
tics. We compared annual average NO2 concentrations based on
measurements from 366 U.S. EPA monitors in 2006 (the base
year for the temporal LUR model; Bechle et al. 2015) with the
LUR-based estimates for each block group in which a monitor
was located. We then compared the distributions of the LUR
model residuals (i.e., the measured – predicted values) among
block groups categorized by tertiles of percent nonwhite residents
and tertiles of average per capita income in 2010. In addition, we
compared the nonwhite–white NO2 disparity (core environmental
injustice metric) based on U.S. EPA monitor data versus LUR
model estimates for the 366 block groups with U.S. EPA
monitors.
Results
Estimated Changes in NO2 Concentrations by
Demographic Groups
Consistent with national trends, outdoor annual average NO2
concentrations decreased substantially across all race-ethnicity,
income, education, and age groups during 2000 to 2010. Overall,
on a national basis, the estimated population-weighted mean NO2
concentration decreased from 14:1 ppb in 2000 to 8:9 ppb in
2010, an absolute change of −5:2 ppb and a relative change of
−37% (Table 1). Estimated changes among groups defined by
race-ethnicity, income, age, and education ranged from −3:5 ppb
to −8:6 ppb (−33% to −42%).
In general, the groups with the highest estimated NO2 expo-
sures in 2000 experienced the largest reductions in NO2 concen-
trations from year 2000 to year 2010 (see Figures S1 and S2). As
an example, the Hispanic black group, the group with the highest
estimated mean NO2 exposure in 2000 [20:8 ppb; 6:6 ppb (38%)
higher than the national mean] experienced the largest estimated
reduction in NO2 exposure from 2000 to 2010 [−8:6 ppb, a
3:3 ppb (48%) greater concentration reduction than the national
mean reduction].
In 2000 and 2010, disparities in estimated mean NO2 concen-
trations were larger by race-ethnicity group than by income, edu-
cation, or age group (Table 1). For example, in 2000, mean NO2
concentrations for race-ethnicity groups ranged from 10:1 ppb
(non-Hispanic American Indian group) to 20:8 ppb (black
Hispanic group), a maximum difference of 10:7 ppb, compared
with maximum differences of 1:7 ppb, 0:9 ppb, and 0:7 ppb
between the education, income, and age groups with the highest
and lowest mean exposures, respectively. In 2010, mean NO2
concentrations for race-ethnicity groups ranged from 6:6 ppb to
12:2 ppb (a maximum difference of 6:5 ppb), whereas mean val-
ues for all individual education, income, and age subgroups were
within 1:0 ppb of the national average.
On a national basis, rankings (most to least exposed groups)
remained fairly consistent over time (Figure 1). For the six largest
race-ethnicity
groups,
rank-order
by
estimated
population-
weighted mean NO2 concentration remained constant with time:
the non-Hispanic Asian group was most exposed and the non-
Hispanic American Indian group was least exposed over time.
Differences by age, income, and education were small compared
with differences by race-ethnicity in both time periods.
After controlling for urban versus rural location (see Figures
S3 and S4, Table S1), disparities in NO2 concentrations by race-
ethnicity persisted (with higher concentrations and higher dis-
parities in urban than in rural locations), with some differences
in exposure patterns for demographic groups by urban versus
rural location in each year. For example, estimated population-
weighted mean NO2 concentrations were lower for non-Hispanic
American Indians than non-Hispanic whites in rural locations
(−1:3 ppb in 2000; −0:5 in 2010) but higher in urban locations
( + 0:2 ppb 2000; + 0:1 ppb in 2010).
Results for supplemental measures of socioeconomic status
(poverty, employment) and language (see Table S2) were gener-
ally consistent with the core demographic characteristics (race-
ethnicity, income, education, and age). NO2 concentrations were
higher for people below the poverty level than above the poverty
level, for households with a language other than English than
households with only English, and for linguistically isolated than
nonlinguistically isolated households. NO2 concentrations were
higher for employed than for unemployed populations.
Estimated Changes in NO2 Concentrations by Block Group
Demographic Characteristics
Consistent with population-based results, block groups with a
higher proportion of race-ethnicity minority residents tended to
have higher concentrations of NO2, and this pattern was consis-
tent over time (Figure 2). In 2000, the 5% of block groups with
the highest proportion of nonwhite residents had 2.5 times higher
[ + 13:2 ppb (22:1 ppb vs. 8:9 ppb)] estimated mean NO2 concen-
trations than the 5% of block groups with the lowest proportion
of nonwhite residents; in 2010, the 2.5-fold gap had increased
slightly, to 2.7-fold [ + 8:9 ppb (14:1 ppb vs. 5:2 ppb)]. Considering
urban versus rural block groups separately (see Figure S5), urban
results were consistent with national results [the 5% of urban block
groups with the highest versus lowest proportion of nonwhite resi-
dents had 1.8 times higher [+ 10:3 ppb (23:6 ppb vs. 13:3 ppb)]
mean NO2 concentration in 2000 and 1.8 times higher [+ 6:9 ppb
(15:0 ppb vs. 8:1 ppb)] mean NO2 concentration in 2010), whereas
rural results had the reverse pattern to a minor extent: NO2 concen-
trations were lower in block groups with a higher proportion of non-
white residents (the 5% of rural block groups with the highest vs.
lowest proportion of nonwhite residents had 0.7 times lower
[−1:9 ppb (5:4 ppb vs. 7:3 ppb)] mean NO2 concentrations 2000]
and 0.8 times lower [−0:9 (3:8 ppb vs. 4:6 ppb)] mean NO2 con-
centration in 2010).
In urban areas, disparities in block group estimated mean
NO2 concentrations by race-ethnicity (for nonwhites vs. whites)
persisted over time, regardless of average block group per capita
income or the size of the urban area (large, medium, or small),
and were generally larger than disparities by income (see Figure
S6). For example, in large urban areas in 2010, estimated mean
NO2 concentrations were 3:0 ppb higher (16:8 ppb vs. 13:8 ppb)
for block groups with the highest versus lowest quintile percent
nonwhite residents at the 25th percentile income ($18,000) and
Environmental Health Perspectives

 4:2 ppb higher (16:4 ppb vs. 12:2 ppb) for block groups with the
highest versus lowest quintile nonwhite residents at the 75th per-
centile income ($33,000). Estimated mean NO2 concentrations
were 1:6 ppb higher (13:8 ppb vs. 12:2 ppb) for the block groups
at the 25th percentile income than at the 75th percentile income
among lowest quintile percent nonwhite block groups, and
0:4 ppb (16:8 ppb vs. 16:4 ppb) higher among the highest quintile
percent nonwhite block groups. In large urban areas, in 2000, the
estimated mean NO2 concentration was 2:9 ppb higher for high-
est income category block groups with the highest quintile non-
white residents (mean per capita income: $74,000; mean percent
nonwhite residents: 88%; mean NO2: 25:4 ppb; population:
56,000) than the lowest income block groups with the lowest
quintile nonwhite residents (mean per capita income: $6,400;
mean percent nonwhite residents: 2.9%; mean NO2: 22:4 ppb;
population: 14,000), and in 2010, 1:2 ppb higher (16:7 ppb vs.
15:5 ppb).
Estimated Changes in NO2 Environmental Injustice Metrics
Nationally, on an absolute basis, environmental injustice declined
from 2000 to 2010. The nonwhite–white NO2 disparity decreased
from 5:0 ppb in 2000 to 2:9 ppb in 2010 (−2:1 ppb [−42%];
Table 2). However, nationally, on a relative basis, environmental
injustice persisted. Nonwhites remained more exposed to outdoor
NO2 air pollution than whites on average in 2010, and there was
little change in the relative NO2 difference between nonwhites
and whites between 2000 and 2010: The nonwhite–white NO2
difference was 33% in 2000 (nonwhites were 40% more exposed
than whites) and 31% in 2010 (nonwhites were 37% more
exposed than whites).
Environmental injustice declined in most, but not all, loca-
tions. In all regions and in most (>75%) states, counties, and
urban areas, the nonwhite–white NO2 disparity decreased over
time (Figure 3). The nonwhite–white NO2 disparity decreased
by >1 ppb in 16 urban areas (accounting for 32% of the urban
area population; 49 million in year 2000), including Detroit
(Michigan), Los Angeles (California), New Orleans (Louisiana),
and Chicago (Illinois). The nonwhite–white NO2 disparity
increased by >1 ppb in two urban areas (accounting for <1% of
the urban population): Watertown (New York) and Delano
(California): both are urban areas for which mean NO2 concen-
trations were higher for whites than nonwhites in 2000, and for
which concentrations decreased to a greater extent for whites
than for nonwhites during 2000 to 2010. Similar patterns hold
among counties: the nonwhite–white NO2 disparity decreased by
>1 ppb in 75 counties (accounting for 16% of the population in
2000), and increased by >1 ppb in 6 counties (accounting for
<0:1% of the population in 2000), for all of which NO2 concen-
trations were higher for whites than for nonwhites in 2000.
The alternate environmental injustice metrics considered
(see Figures S7–S10) were moderately correlated (see Tables
Table 1. Estimated NO2 population-weighted mean concentration (ppb) for year 2000, year 2010, and estimated change over time (year 2010–year 2000), by
race-ethnicity, household income quintile, educational attainment, and age.

 S3–S5). For example, for urban areas, changes in alternate
environmental injustice metrics were moderately correlated
(Pearson’s correlation coefficient, r, range: 0.3–0.8; Spearman’s
rank coefficient, s, range: 0.2–0.9). New York and California
had large reductions (high decile reductions) in all five environ-
mental injustice metrics, and North Dakota had increases (low
decile reductions) in all five environmental injustice metrics.
Similar to the patterns for the nonwhite–white NO2 disparity,
the black–white, Hispanic–white, and Asian–white NO2 dispar-
ity decreased in most (>75%) regions, states, counties, and
urban areas from 2000 to 2010. In contrast, the poverty-based
NO2 disparity increased in nearly half of states and counties,
although in general, the poverty-based NO2 disparities were
smaller than the race-based NO2 disparity metrics (e.g., among
states the mean change in the poverty-based NO2 disparity was
−0:2 ppb vs. −1:0 ppb for the Asian–white NO2 disparity).

Potential Influence of Changes in NO2 Emissions and
Changes in Demographic Patterns to Changes in
Environmental Injustice over Time
When we estimated what population-weighted mean NO2 con-
centrations in 2010 would have been if residential demographic
patterns changed as observed but NO2 concentrations were fixed
as in 2000, we predicted a decrease in mean NO2 exposure for

 nonwhites from 17:6 ppb to 16:6 ppb (−1:0 ppb) and for whites
from 12.6 ppb to 12:1 ppb in whites (−0:5 ppb), for a change
of −0:6 ppb in the nonwhite–white NO2 disparity over time
(5:0 ppb in 2000, 4:5 ppb in 2010), in contrast with the estimated
change of −2:1 ppb in the nonwhite–white NO2 disparity (Table
2). When we estimated what population-weighted mean NO2
concentrations in 2010 would have been if residential demo-
graphic patterns were fixed as in 2000 but NO2 concentrations
decreased as observed, we predicted a decrease in mean NO2 ex-
posure for nonwhites to 11:4 ppb (−6:3 ppb) and for whites to
8:1 ppb (−4:5 ppb), for a change of −1:8 ppb in the nonwhite-
white NO2 disparity over time (5:0 ppb in 2000, 3:3 ppb in 2010).
This analysis of counterfactual scenarios suggests that both
changes in NO2 and changes in residential demographic patterns
contributed to the observed reductions in the national nonwhite-
white NO2 disparity, with changes in NO2 contributing to a larger
extent (83%, i.e., −1:8 ppb of the −2:1 ppb observed change in
environmental injustice metric) than changes in residential demo-
graphic patterns (26%, i.e., −0:6 ppb of the −2:1 ppb observed
change in environmental injustice metric). [The individual contri-
butions of these two factors sum to greater than 100%, indicating
interaction effects (9%) due to air pollution and population chang-
ing together.]
Potential Relevance of Changes in Environmental Injustice
for Public Health
In 2000 and in 2010, nonwhites were more likely than whites to
live in block groups with NO2 concentrations above international

 health-based guidelines. In 2000, 30% of nonwhites and 10% of
whites lived in block groups with NO2 concentrations above the
WHO annual guideline (>21 ppb), compared with 5% of non-
whites and 2% of whites in 2010 (see Figures S11–S12, Table
S6). Thus, nonwhites were three times as likely as whites to live
in a block group above the WHO guideline in 2000, and 2.5 times
as likely in 2010. Conversely, 23% of nonwhites and 44% of
whites lived in block groups with NO2 concentrations below 50%
of the WHO guideline (<11 ppb) in 2000, compared with 56% of
nonwhites and 80% of whites in 2010. Thus, nonwhites were 0.5
and 0.7 times as likely as whites to live in a block group with
population-weighted mean NO2 concentrations <50% of the
WHO guideline in 2000 and 2010, respectively. For the urban
population in 2000 and 2010, nonwhites were 2.1 times and 3.5
times as likely, respectively, to live in a block group with mean
NO2 concentrations above the WHO guideline. Most of the ru-
ral population (95% of whites and 97% of nonwhites in 2000;
99% of whites and nonwhites in 2010) lived in blocks groups
with NO2 concentrations below 50% of the WHO guidelines.
Based on the simplified health impact calculation, the esti-
mated mean NO2 concentration burden for nonwhites relative to
whites (5:0 ppb in 2000, 2:9 ppb in 2010) was associated with an
estimated ∼ 7,000 (95% CI: 2000, 10,000) additional premature
IHD deaths for nonwhites in the United States in 2000 and an
estimated ∼ 5,000 (95% CI: 1,000, 9,000) in 2010 (calculations
presented in Table S7). Thus, the reduction in the mean
nonwhite–white NO2 disparity (−2:1 ppb between 2000 and
2010) was associated with preventing an estimated ∼ 2,000 (95%
CI: 400, 3,000) premature IHD deaths per year among nonwhites.
The purpose of this simplified (back-of-the-envelope) calculation
was to provide background and context for concentration dispar-
ities reported here. This health impact calculation was limited by
several important simplifying assumptions and considerations
[i.e., this calculation assumed that the U.S. population breathed
the national mean NO2 concentration, considered only one health
impact (IHD mortality), assumed that the IHD mortality rate is
constant over time and by race-ethnicity and U.S. location, and
did not adjust for differences in age by race-ethnicity or over
time]. This simplified health impact calculation suggests that the
estimated nonwhite–white NO2 disparity may have been associ-
ated with potentially large health impacts (i.e., thousands of IHD
deaths per year in the United States); more detailed analyses are
needed to fully investigate the implications of NO2 disparities for
public health.
Sensitivity Analyses on Uncertainty in NO2 LUR
Model Estimates
When we compared LUR model-based NO2 estimates for the
366 block groups with U.S. EPA monitors to the monitor-based
NO2 observations, median model-based NO2 concentrations
were lower for block groups in the middle and highest tertiles of
percent nonwhite residents, and higher for block groups in the
lowest tertile of percent nonwhite residents (see Figure S13).
Median model-based estimates were also higher than monitor-
based estimates for block groups in the highest tertile of average
per capita income. When we estimated the nonwhite–white NO2
disparity for these block groups in 2006 (the year for which mon-
itor data were available; 670,000 people, 48% nonwhite) the dis-
parity was larger when based on monitor data (3:3 ppb; 13:4 ppb
vs. 10:1 ppb for nonwhites and whites, respectively) than LUR
model predictions (2:3 ppb; 12:2 ppb vs. 9:8 ppb for nonwhites
and whites, respectively). These findings suggest that our model-
based results may under-estimate disparities in exposures.
Discussion
Estimated average NO2 concentrations decreased for almost all
U.S. populations and locations from 2000 to 2010. Disparities in
average NO2 concentrations by race-ethnicity decreased on an
absolute basis (e.g., the nonwhite–white difference decreased
from 5:0 ppb in 2000 to 2:9 ppb in 2010). However, despite these
improvements, estimated average annual concentrations contin-
ued to be higher for nonwhite populations than for white popula-
tions in 2010 (nonwhite–white difference: 31% in 2010, 33% in
2000). In 2010, the estimated average concentration in the 5% of
block groups with the highest proportion of nonwhite residents
was 2.7 times higher than in the 5% of block groups with the low-
est proportion of nonwhite residents (2.5 times higher in 2000).
Therefore, our findings suggest that over time, NO2 concentra-
tions decreased; disparities by race-ethnicity decreased on an
absolute basis but on a relative basis have persisted.
Our finding that, on a relative basis, NO2 air pollution dispar-
ities by race-ethnicity persisted in the United States over time is
consistent with a recent U.S. cohort study that reported that esti-
mated NO2 concentrations during 1990 to 2009 were ∼ 10%
higher for blacks and Hispanics than whites, even after control-
ling
for
individual
socioeconomic
characteristics
(income,
employment, home ownership) and metropolitan area characteris-
tics (residential segregation, industry) (Kravitz-Wirtz et al.
2016). Our findings are also consistent with a national study of
industry-related air pollution that reported that, although esti-
mated exposures to industrial hazardous air pollutants (HAPs)
decreased in the United States during 1994–2005, HAPs expo-
sures remained ∼ 1:5 times higher for African Americans than
whites (Ard 2015); in our study, NO2 exposures remained ∼ 1:3
times higher for African Americans than whites.
Our findings suggested that most of the reduction in
nonwhite–white NO2 disparities between 2000 and 2010 was at-
tributable to overall reductions in outdoor NO2 concentrations.
Emissions-reductions were achieved in part via emission-control
technology in motor vehicles (particularly in gasoline vehicles
during this time period; McDonald et al. 2012) and stationary
sources (e.g., power plants) (U.S. EPA 2016). In addition, U.S.
metropolitan regions became more suburban, and suburban areas
became more racially diverse during 2000 to 2010 (Howell and
Timberlake 2014). Shifts in demographic residential patterns
leading to larger proportions of race-ethnicity minorities in subur-
ban locations (where TRAP concentrations are typically lower
compared with central cities or downtown locations) also may
have contributed to reductions in NO2 disparities by race-
ethnicity during this time period.
Our evidence of larger NO2 disparities by race-ethnicity than
by income is consistent with previous studies of environmental
injustice in TRAP (e.g., Clark et al. 2014) and with persistent pat-
terns of residential segregation in U.S. metropolitan regions,
which remain more segregated by race than by income (Reardon
et al. 2015). Additional work is needed to further investigate
potential underlying causes (e.g., changes in patterns of residen-
tial segregation) of changes in environmental injustice in expo-
sure to TRAP over time.
Although absolute NO2 exposure disparities reduced substan-
tially during this period, there remain potentially large public
health benefits from eliminating these disparities: nonwhites
remained 2.5 times more likely than whites to live in block groups
above WHO guidelines for NO2 in 2010, and based on the back-
of-the-envelope
calculation
described
above,
the
estimated
nonwhite–white NO2 disparity may have been associated with
thousands of premature IHD deaths among nonwhites in 2010.
Our analyses have several important limitations. Due to limi-
tations in the spatial resolution of the Census data, we were
Environmental Health Perspectives
097012-8
 unable to explore spatial patterns in air pollution and demo-
graphics at spatial scales finer than Census block groups. We
focused on outdoor air pollution exposures, and we were unable
to explore the potential influence of time-activity patterns for
which air pollution exposure gradients by race-ethnicity and soci-
oeconomic status may exist, including exposures during commut-
ing, at work, or indoors (O’Neill et al. 2003). In addition, we
evaluated only one pollutant at only two time points. Spatial pat-
terns may differ for other TRAPs or for cumulative exposures to
multiple pollutants. We also did not account for joint effects
(interactions) of race-ethnicity and socioeconomic characteristics.
Finally, our estimates were limited by uncertainties in the NO2
LUR model estimates and Census data. The impact of uncertain-
ties in the Census data, particularly for national race-ethnicity
data that represent an almost complete sample of ∼ 300 million
people, is likely to be small relative to the potential impact of
uncertainties in NO2 LUR model estimates. Findings from a sen-
sitivity analysis comparing results when NO2 exposure estimates
were based on U.S. EPA monitor data instead of our LUR model
suggested that exposure misclassification may have varied in a
way that would have caused us to underestimate true disparities
by race-ethnicity in outdoor NO2 concentrations in the United
States. However, we were unable to directly test the potential
consequences of exposure misclassification on our national-scale
estimates of environmental injustice.
Conclusion
During 2000 to 2010, estimated annual average exposures to out-
door NO2 air pollution declined across all race-ethnicity and
socioeconomic groups [range of mean change: −33% to −42%
(−3:5 ppb to −8:6 ppb)]. The most exposed groups in 2000 expe-
rienced, on average, the largest reductions in NO2 during 2000 to
2010. Disparities in NO2 exposure were larger by race-ethnicity
than by other demographic characteristics (income, education,
age) in 2000 and 2010, with higher exposures for race-ethnicity
minorities. The estimated national mean nonwhite–white NO2
disparity decreased from 5:0 ppb in 2000 to 2:9 ppb in 2010.
Most of this reduction in the national mean nonwhite–white NO2
disparity over time is attributable to reductions in outdoor NO2
concentrations, suggesting that existing efforts to reduce TRAP
are also reducing TRAP exposure disparities by race-ethnicity
over time. Despite these improvements in absolute exposures, rel-
ative exposure disparities persisted, with nonwhites remaining
exposed to 37% more NO2 than whites on average in 2010, and
2.5 times more likely than whites to live in a block group with
NO2 concentration above WHO guidelines in 2010. Overall,
these findings suggest that continued improvements to air quality
may further reduce TRAP exposure disparities by race-ethnicity.
However, eliminating disparities may require additional policies
and interventions that target the underlying causes of environ-
mental injustice.
