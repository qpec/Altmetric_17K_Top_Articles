Abstract 
Background: In previous systematic reviews, predominantly of randomised controlled trials, 
pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) has been shown to reduce hospital admissions for acute exacerbations 
of COPD (AECOPD). However, findings have been less consistent for cohort studies. We aimed to 
compare rates of hospitalized and general practice (GP) treated AECOPD before and after PR.  
Methods: Using anonymised data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and Hospital Episode 
Statistics, hospital admissions and GP visits for AECOPD were compared one year before and after PR 
in patients referred for PR. Exacerbation rates were also compared between individuals eligible and 
referred for PR with those eligible and not referred.  
Results: 69,089 (64%) of the COPD patients in the cohort were eligible for PR. Of these, only 6,436 
(9.3%) were recorded as having been referred for rehabilitation. 62, 019 (89.8%) were not referred 
and 634 (0.98%) declined referral. When combining GP and hospital exacerbations, people who were 
eligible and were referred for PR had a slightly higher but not statistically significant exacerbation rate 
(2.83 exacerbations/patient-year 95% CI: 2.66, 3.00) than those who were eligible but not referred 
(2.17 exacerbations/patient-year 95% CI: 2.11, 2.24).  
Conclusions: This study found that less than 10% of patients who were eligible for PR were actually 
referred. Patients who were eligible and referred for (but not necessarily completed) PR did not have 
fewer GP visits and hospitalizations for AECOPD in the year after PR compared to those not referred 
or compared to the year before PR.

Introduction 
 
AECOPD contribute to disease progression and mortality, and are important for patients and health 
care providers; negatively impacting on health related quality of life,1,2 leading to a decline in 
pulmonary function3 and increased use of health care.4 Patients experience on average 1-3 treated 
exacerbations per year5 with up to 10% of patients dying during a hospital admission for AECOPD6 and 
up to 25% within a year of admission for AECOPD.7 
Pulmonary rehabilitation is a key component of the multi-disciplinary management of COPD8 and can 
improve exercise capacity, dyspnoea, activities of daily living, muscle strength, self-efficacy, and 
quality of life.9 Given the evidence of these benefits, a recent Cochrane Editorial stated that no further 
systematic reviews are required to show that pulmonary rehabilitation improves patient-related 
outcomes.10 
A recent update in a 2016 systematic review by Puhan et al11 found that pulmonary rehabilitation 
reduced hospital readmissions but results were heterogenous and evidence did not show a statistically 
significant effect of rehabilitation on mortality. Results from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in 
another recent review suggested that PR reduces subsequent readmissions but pooled results from 
cohort studies and before-and-after studies did not 12. Therefore the evidence for the benefits of PR 
on reducing hospital admissions remains unclear. Furthermore, no study has investigated the effect 
of pulmonary rehabilitation on reducing hospital admissions or milder GP treated events, particularly 
in less severe COPD patients; arguably the ones who make up the majority of referrals for pulmonary 
rehabilitation. This is important as GP managed exacerbations have been associated with declines in 
exercise capacity and muscle strength, and reduced physical activity can impact on quality of life.13  
 
This study aimed to compare the rates of hospitalized and general practice (GP) treated AECOPD 
before and after PR, using primary care data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), 
linked with Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). Firstly, exacerbation rates were compared in those who 
were eligible and referred for PR versus those who were eligible and were not referred during all time 
observed (Observation 1: Figure 1). Secondly, we compared exacerbation rates before and after PR in 
those who were eligible for PR and were referred over the whole study period (Observation 2). Thirdly 
we compared one year before and one year after PR in those who were eligible and were referred 
(Observation 3). Fourthly, we compared exacerbation rates one year before and one year after PR for 
those who actually completed the course of rehabilitation (Observation 4). Finally, we examined 
 4 
 
length of stay for those who were hospitalized for AECOPD at least once in the year before and the 
year after rehabilitation. 
 
 
Materials & Methods 
Study Subjects 
People over the age of 35 who had  a GP recorded diagnosis of COPD using a validated definition14 and 
did not have alpha one antitrypsin deficiency but had at least one year of historical data before the 
study start were included. People were deemed eligible for pulmonary rehabilitation if they had a 
pulmonary rehabilitation code which suggested they were eligible (see Appendix for code list), or if 
they had an MRC score of 3 or more,  or if they had 2 or more GP treated AECOPD in a year or one 
hospital admission for an AECOPD in a year. This definition was based on current clinical practice for 
referral15. We used a previously validated definition to identify AECOPD in CPRD and HES.16,17 IRB 
approval was not required as this study used anonymous patient data. Approval was obtained from 
the CPRD Independent Scientific Advisory Committee (ISAC), prior to study start which oversees 
research involving CPRD data (protocol ref: 15_193R; available on request). 
 
Study design 
This is a propensity weighted cohort study and also a before-after analysis was carried out. The 
STROBE (strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology) guidelines18 were used 
in this study.  
 
Methods 
CPRD is an electronic database of UK general practice data that has been widely used for research.19 
It contains anonymised records for over 13 million patients, of whom 4.4 million are currently 
registered with a practice that is contributing data to CPRD, representing about 9% of the UK 
population. Data held include information on consultations, diagnoses, tests, referrals to secondary 
care and prescriptions from primary care as well as some lifestyle data. Data are predominantly 
recorded using a system of “Read codes”; a hierarchical system of codes which include diagnoses, 
clinical signs, symptoms and lifestyle characteristics. Around 60% of the patients included in the 
CPRD have been linked to HES, an administrative database containing information on all episodes of 
National Health Service (NHS) inpatient care in England16. Diagnoses in HES are recorded using 
International Classification of Disease version 10 (ICD-10) codes (see Appendix).

Figure 1 shows the study design and the four main observation spells. The date of entry to the cohort 
was the latest of the 1st January 2004, diagnosis of COPD and date of being eligible for (or having done) 
pulmonary rehabilitation. The end of the follow up was the earliest of the end of the study period (31st 
March 2014), the last date of data collection, the date of death or the date of transfer to another 
practice. Controls (COPD patients not referred for rehabilitation) were age, gender and CPRD practice 
matched to COPD patients who were referred for pulmonary rehabilitation. The date of referral for 
rehabilitation was the index date for the match. Patients were deemed eligible for PR if they had a 
MRC score of 3 or higher, had 2 or more GP exacerbations in a 1 year time period or had 1 hospital 
admission for an AECOPD in 1 year. Patients were considered ineligible if they had cerebrovascular 
disease, rheumatoid arthritis, depression, heart failure, or stroke.  
 
Analysis 
Baseline characteristics were tabulated and Chi-square tests performed to test the association 
between the pulmonary rehabilitation status and categorical explanatory variables. Exacerbation 
rates of AECOPD were compared in the year before and one year after pulmonary rehabilitation, only 
on patients who were ever referred for rehabilitation. Recorded visits to the GP for an exacerbation 
and hospital visits were analysed separately and then in combination for patients who were recorded 
as having pulmonary rehabilitation and compared with patients who were eligible, but were not 
referred for pulmonary rehabilitation. Length of hospital stay was also analysed in people who were 
eligible and referred for pulmonary rehabilitation in the year before and year after pulmonary 
rehabilitation using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Statistical calculations used Version 14 of the Stata 
statistical package.20  
 
The observation period for each patient was defined as an interval of time at risk between 2 successive 
dates (beginning on the first event date and ending on the day before the last event date). An event 
date could be an imputed patient birthday (1 July on any year from the patient birth year), date of 
patient entry to observation by CPRD, date of patient exit from observation by CPRD, date of initiation 
of pulmonary rehabilitation, date 1 year before initiation, date 1 year after initiation, or date of 
diagnosis of one of the following diseases: COPD, asthma, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatoid 
arthritis, depression, heart failure, or stroke. The outcomes were numbers of AECOPD reported by the 
patient’s GP (determined in CPRD), numbers of COPD exacerbations leading to hospitalizations 
(determined in HES and excluding elective admissions), and total numbers of both, in the duration of 
observation for that patient. We used Poisson generalized linear models, with exposure time at risk 
 6 
 
expressed in person-years, and Huber variances clustered by practice. Analyses were done on 4 
subsets of observation periods and are listed in the Appendix. 
 
Propensity weights were calculated using a propensity score from a logistic regression model, with 
Huber variances clustered by practice, with pulmonary rehabilitation treatment as the outcome, and 
confounding covariates as the predictors. Methods for the propensity scoring and list of confounders 
are described in the Appendix. 
 
Results 
 
Figure 2. Flow Chart of Eligibility for the Study  
 
Figure 2 shows the flow of subjects included and Table 1 describes the baseline demographics and co-
morbidities of patients included in the analysis. 108,041 patients were included; of these 53% were 
male. A total of 38,952 (36%) COPD patients were not eligible for pulmonary rehabilitation; i.e. did not 
meet our eligibility criteria. Of the 69,089 eligible; 6,436 (9.3%) were recorded a having been referred 
to or completed pulmonary rehabilitation, 62,019 (89.8%) were not referred and 634 (0.9%) were 
referred but declined. The mean age (standard deviation) of patients who received rehabilitation was 
64.53 (10.17). Table 2 provides the baseline respiratory related characteristics of the COPD patients. 
The average follow up time for all eligible patients was 3.29 years, and for those eligible and referred 
for PR 4.57 years.  
 
 
Exacerbation rates in COPD patients referred for pulmonary rehabilitation versus those not referred 
(Observation 1) 
Figure 3 and Table 3 show a) the exacerbation rate per person-year at risk and the 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) comparing individuals who were not referred with individuals who were referred for PR; 
and b) the exacerbation rate ratios (95% CI) in unweighted and propensity weighted analyses 
comparing people not referred  with people referred.  If patients received an extra diagnosis after the 
initial time point from when pulmonary rehabilitation started they were given extra weighting in the 
analysis. The total results (GP and hospital exacerbations) showed that people who were referred for 
pulmonary rehabilitation had a slightly higher but not significant exacerbation rate of 2.83 
exacerbations/person-year (95% CI 2.66, 3.00) than individuals who were not referred (2.17 95% CI 
2.11, 2.24) 
 7 
 
 
 
Exacerbation rates in COPD patients before and after pulmonary rehabilitation (Observation 2) 
Figure 4 and Table 4 show a) the exacerbation rate per person-year at risk and the 95% CIs before and 
after pulmonary rehabilitation and b) the exacerbation rate ratios (95% CI) in unweighted and 
propensity weighted analyses comparing people before and after rehabilitation. The total results (GP 
and hospital exacerbations) showed that after pulmonary rehabilitation, people had a slightly higher 
but not statistically significant exacerbation rate of 3.15 exacerbations/person-year (95% CI:  2.97, 
3.33) compared to before PR (2.79 95% CI: 2.65, 2.93). Higher exacerbation rate ratios were observed 
for hospital AECOPD than for AECOPD seen in primary care. Table 4 provides the detailed results. 
  
Exacerbation rates: one year before and one year after pulmonary rehabilitation in COPD patients who 
were referred (Observation 3) 
AECOPD rates per person-year at risk (95% CI) 1 year before and 1 year after initiation of pulmonary 
rehabilitation are shown in Figure 5 (a). The same trend was observed in the before-after comparison 
in each analysis as observed in Figure 4. Higher exacerbation rates per person-year at risk were 
observed for individuals in the year following referral for pulmonary rehabilitation (3.18 95% CI 3.02, 
3.35) compared to the year prior to pulmonary rehabilitation (3.04 95% CI 2.88, 3.20). Figure 5 (b) 
shows the exacerbation rate ratio (95% CI) in unweighted and propensity weighted analyses 
comparing 1 year before and 1 year after pulmonary rehabilitation. Higher exacerbation rate ratios 
were observed in primary care compared to hospital events. Table 5 provides the detailed scores for 
exacerbation rates per person-year at risk observed in the before-after analysis. 
 
Exacerbation rates one year before and one year after pulmonary rehabilitation in those who 
completed pulmonary rehabilitation (Observation 4) 
Figure 6 (a) shows the exacerbation rate per person-year at risk (95% CI) 1 year before and 1 year 
after pulmonary rehabilitation in individuals who completed rehabilitation (see Table 6 for scores). 
And Figure 6 (b) shows the exacerbation rate ratio (95% CI) in unweighted and propensity weighted 
analyses comparing people completing pulmonary rehabilitation 1 year before and 1 year after. . The 
propensity weighted scores revealed that patients who completed pulmonary rehabilitation had a 
higher exacerbation rate per person-year at risk (3.49 95% CI 3.09, 3.95) in the year after compared 
to the year before pulmonary rehabilitation (3.31 95% CI 2.89, 3.79). Finally, higher exacerbation 
rate ratios were observed in hospital exacerbations compared to GP exacerbations.

Length of hospital stay 
When looking at length of hospital stay (LOS) in a subset of 305 patients who were hospitalized for 
AECOPD at least once in the year before and once in the year after rehabilitation, there was no 
reduction in the median length of stay following pulmonary rehabilitation. Figure 7 shows that the 
median LOS one year before rehabilitation was 4 days (IQR = 2-8 days) compared to one year after in 
which the median LOS was 7 days (IQR = 3-18). 
 
 
Discussion 
Less than 10% of patients with COPD in the UK who were eligible for pulmonary rehabilitation in this 
study were actually referred. Patients who were eligible and referred for pulmonary rehabilitation 
from primary care did not have fewer GP visits or hospital admissions for AECOPD one year after 
rehabilitation when compared to those who were eligible but were not referred. The same trend was 
observed when comparing exacerbation rates in one year before and one year after rehabilitation in 
those eligible and referred and limiting the analysis to a subset of patients who had evidence of having 
completed pulmonary rehabilitation. This is in agreement with more recent studies that have shown 
no benefit of rehabilitation on hospital readmissions11. When comparing GP exacerbations with 
hospital exacerbations, COPD exacerbation severity did not appear to reduce in the year after 
pulmonary rehabilitation. Furthermore we found no reduction in hospital LOS for exacerbations of 
COPD pre- and post- pulmonary rehabilitation. 
 
One of the key strengths of this study is the large cohort of COPD patients examined over a long period 
of time with exacerbation data from both primary and secondary care. Additionally, the data used are 
from routinely collected primary care and hospital sources, reflecting real life patients seen in every 
day clinical practice. This was a large cohort study and the results are similar to those  of other studies 
including a retrospective cohort study in California by Nguyen et al.,21  which compared rates of 
exacerbations in 558 patients who received pulmonary rehabilitation in the stable state to 1,114 
patients who did not. 12 months after the programme, 10% of the non-intervention group were 
hospitalized for an exacerbation, whereas 18% of the pulmonary rehabilitation group were 
hospitalized. 
 
However, there are several weaknesses that might explain the differences between these findings and 
those of systematic reviews and some RCTs. Firstly, records from CPRD and HES may not be a complete 
and accurate reflection of what COPD patients are actually experiencing as not all patients receiving 
 9 
 
pulmonary rehabilitation will be recorded by clinicians and captured in electronic health records. 
Indeed in this study less than 10% of COPD patients who were eligible were referred. Secondly, we 
have not analysed the compliance with rehabilitation but only investigated patients who were 
captured as having been referred for pulmonary rehabilitation. As only around 40% of people referred 
for pulmonary rehabilitation complete a course,22 the lack of benefit seen here is likely to be 
underestimated. Another weakness of our study and using electronic health data is that we were not 
able to examine the nature of PR programmes that patients were referred to such as the number of 
sessions, intensity and content of the rehabilitation to compare them with UK standards and 
guidelines. We are aware that patients may have been referred to PR via other sources and thus not 
captured as having been referred in this dataset but given the nature of health care provision in the 
UK with the GP at the centre, this is likely to be minimal. Certainly of those referred, a higher 
proportion are likely to have completed than has been recorded, and improved coding of completion 
of pulmonary rehabilitation (for which Read codes do exist) would aid commissioners and pulmonary 
rehabilitation providers in determining the effects and benefits of pulmonary rehabilitation. 
 
 
 
One of the reasons why results from our study differed from those of RCTs is that patients in the RCTs 
completed the course of pulmonary rehabilitation and may have had greater compliance, and thus 
effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation on reducing admission may be greater. Another issue is that 
pulmonary rehabilitation programmes vary significantly, and although guidelines for pulmonary 
rehabilitation programmes exist,15 differing interpretations of these guidelines can occur in routine 
practice, thus programmes may vary between centres across the country.22 As previously mentioned 
we were not able to assess the content and quality of the PR programmes.  
 
Another important consideration is how education within rehabilitation programmes is delivered to 
and received by patients. One study which randomised patients into a comprehensive care 
management plan (CCMP) versus usual care found that mortality was higher in the CCMP group.23 
This group received COPD education on self-management and an action plan for identification and 
treatment of their exacerbations. The higher mortality figure suggests that despite having education 
about self-management, some patients still do not seek advice and treatment early enough to 
reduce exacerbations, or conversely that they become more vigilant and aware of their symptoms. 
Finally, the severity of COPD patients who are eligible for pulmonary rehabilitation is different, and 
this too may contribute to the lack of exacerbation reduction. However, when we restricted the 
 10 
 
analysis to hospital events only, we still did not see a reduction in exacerbations. There may be 
unobserved confounding despite propensity matching. Reductions in LOS after rehabilitation have 
also been reported in some RCTs24,25 and observational studies26 whereas a reduction in LOS was not 
observed in this cohort.  Reasons for this may include the fact that patients in our analysis are older 
and frailer and possibly have more comorbidities than those who participated in the RCTs. 
Furthermore we only considered hospitalizations for AECOPD and did not include other causes of 
hospitalizations.  
 
There are a number of potential biases that might affect recorded exacerbation rates between the 
various comparator groups in our study, particularly confounding by indication (i.e. those presenting 
with exacerbations are more likely to be referred) and the impact of attendance on health 
behaviours where the provision of education during PR might actually increase because of a 
heighted awareness of treatment need. In addition, variations in exacerbation frequency over time, 
may have had an impact on the year to year comparison in those referred for PR.  
 
Our study and several other observational studies have not replicated the findings from RCTs and our 
recent systematic review12 which have suggested that pulmonary rehabilitation is effective at reducing 
the frequency of exacerbations, however a reductionn AECOPD has been observed in RCTs of 
pulmonary rehabilitation post exacerbation. RCT programmes may have more effective content, 
delivery, follow up and motivation than standard rehabilitation courses. Surveys have suggested that 
the provision of pulmonary rehabilitation services can vary both within and between countries.27 This 
highlights the need for pulmonary rehabilitation courses to be accredited and able to demonstrate 
adherence to the standards found in RCTs to be of maximum benefit to patients.   This study also 
highlights the need for GPs to record completers of pulmonary rehabilitation for measurement of 
more accurate and meaningful outcomes.  
 
Pulmonary rehabilitation has many other benefits aside from reducing healthcare consumption and 
exacerbations. Although there is no convincing biological rationale to suggest that PR will reduce the 
frequency of lung events, there is evidence that early pulmonary rehabilitation following an 
exacerbation can lead to a reduced number of days spent in hospital25. Numerous studies have also 
shown pulmonary rehabilitation improves health-related quality of life (QOL),   activity limitation, 
perceived breathlessness, and exercise capacity28,29. These improvements may be arguably more 
important to patients who suffer from COPD than reducing healthcare consumption and thus 
pulmonary rehabilitation remains an important intervention to patients.  
 11 
 
 
Despite this, pulmonary rehabilitation is still underutilised.30,31  Major challenges in realising the 
effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation are that a proportion of people who have COPD and hence 
AECOPD have not been diagnosed,32 and a large proportion of those who have been diagnosed and 
are eligible for pulmonary rehabilitation are not being referred22. In addition the England and Wales 
national COPD audit programme, which includes data from both the acute hospital settings and 
primary care, reported that 31% of patients referred for rehabilitation did not attend the initial 
assessment, and 40% of those referred did not complete the programme22,33. A small proportion of 
individuals are offered pulmonary rehabilitation following an AECOPD but even fewer will take up a 
course34. While we are likely to have overestimated the number of eligible but not referred people in 
this dataset, as we cannot account for the main reasons people may not be eligible, our findings are 
in keeping with the UK pulmonary rehabilitation audit data22.  Further research is needed to look at 
reasons why patients with COPD who are eligible for pulmonary rehabilitation are not being referred, 
reasons why those who are being referred are not completing programmes, and the effect on 
readmissions. Previous studies have suggested that current smoking, a lack of perceived benefit and 
depression are all likely to represent barriers to uptake or increase non-completion.35  
 
Conclusions 
Using data from primary care and hospital records, this study found that patients who were referred 
for pulmonary rehabilitation did not have fewer GP and hospital AECOPD one year following 
pulmonary rehabilitation when compared to those who were not referred. Any effect of PR on 
exacerbation frequency was not detectable through routinely recorded primary care data.    Findings 
from our study, along with results from other studies and audit data, have highlighted a major clinical 
issue in that large proportions of patients are either not starting or are not completing pulmonary 
rehabilitation. As an intervention it has great potential to be effective if patients are referred and can 
adhere to properly-designed and -delivered programmes. Future research looking at the effects of 
pulmonary rehabilitation on GP and hospital visits for COPD should take into account the important 
issues relating to the referral of patients and adherence to programmes, and the national COPD audit 
should monitor the content of rehabilitation more closely.
