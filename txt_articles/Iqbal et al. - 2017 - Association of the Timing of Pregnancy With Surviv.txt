IMPORTANCE Increasing numbers of women experience pregnancy around the time of, or
after, a diagnosis of breast cancer. Understanding the effect of pregnancy on survival in
women with breast cancer will help in the counseling and treatment of these women.
OBJECTIVE To compare the overall survival of women diagnosed with breast cancer during
pregnancy or in the postpartum period with that of women who had breast cancer but did
not become pregnant.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This population-based, retrospective cohort study
linked health administrative databases in Ontario, Canada, comprising 7553 women aged 20
to 45 years at the time of diagnosis with invasive breast cancer, from January 1, 2003, to
December 31, 2014.
EXPOSURES Any pregnancy in the period from 5 years before, until 5 years after, the index
date of the diagnosis of breast cancer. Women were classified into the following 4 exposure
groups: no pregnancy (the referent), pregnancy before breast cancer, pregnancy-associated
breast cancer, and pregnancy following breast cancer.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Five-year actuarial survival rates for all exposure groups,
age-adjusted and multivariable hazard ratios [HRs] of pregnancy for overall survival for all
exposure groups, and time-dependent hazard ratios for women with pregnancy following
breast cancer.
RESULTS Among the 7553 women in the study (mean age at diagnosis, 39.1 years; median, 40
years; range, 20-44 years) the 5-year actuarial survival rate was 87.5% (95% CI,
86.5%-88.4%) for women with no pregnancy, 85.3% (95% CI, 82.8%-87.8%) for women
with pregnancy before breast cancer (age-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.85-1.27;
P = .73), and 82.1% (95% CI, 78.3%-85.9%) for women with pregnancy-associated breast
cancer (age-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.91-1.53; P = .20). The 5-year actuarial
survival rate was 96.7% (95% CI, 94.1%-99.3%) for women who had pregnancy 6 months or
more after diagnosis of breast cancer, vs 87.5% (95% CI, 86.5%-88.4%) for women with no
pregnancy) (age-adjusted HR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.10-0.49; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Pregnancy did not adversely affect survival in women with
breast cancer. For breast cancer survivors who wish to conceive, the risk of death is lowest if
pregnancy occurs 6 months or more after diagnosis.

n the United States, approximately 247 000 women re-
ceivedadiagnosisofbreastcancerin2016,including26 392
women younger than 45 years (10.7% of all cases).1 In re-
cent decades, maternal age at first childbirth has risen by ap-
proximately 5 years in North America, and the fertility rate
among women older than 35 years has increased.2 Given the
trend of delaying motherhood, the proportion of women who
develop breast cancer while pregnant (or wish to become preg-
nant after undergoing breast cancer treatment) is increasing.
Breast cancers diagnosed during pregnancy (or up to 1 year
postpartum)haveunfavorableclinicopathologicfeatures,such
ashightumorgradeandlowexpressionofestrogenreceptor(ER)
and progesterone receptor (PR), compared with breast cancers
diagnosedinnonpregnantwomenofthesameage.3-6However,
whetherornotpregnancycompromisessurvivalremainsamat-
ter of debate.7-16 The treatment of these women is challenging
because both the health of the mother and of the fetus need to
be considered. Chemotherapy is not advisable during the first
trimester of pregnancy; radiotherapy and hormonal therapies
are not recommended at any time during pregnancy.17
Pregnancy that occurs more than 1 year after a diagnosis
of breast cancer does not appear to affect survival.18-22 It is not
clear how long a woman should wait after undergoing breast
cancer treatment before attempting a pregnancy.23-25 Most
women are advised to postpone pregnancy for at least 2 years
after treatment. The main reason for this recommendation is
a concern that gestational hormones, in particular, estrogen,
mightstimulatedormantmicrometastases,andtherebyworsen
survival.26 This study was conducted to compare the overall
survival of women diagnosed with breast cancer during preg-
nancy or in the postpartum period, with that of women who
had breast cancer but did not become pregnant.
Methods
Study Design and Data Sources
We performed a population-based, retrospective cohort study
in Ontario, Canada, linking a cancer database, a natality data-
base,andamortalitydatabase,locatedattheInstituteforClini-
cal Evaluative Sciences, Toronto (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Welinkedthesedatabasesusinguniqueencodedidentifiersand
analyzed them at the Women’
s College Hospital, Toronto.
The research protocol was approved by the research ethics
boards of the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and the Wo-
men’
s College Hospital in Toronto. Under Section 45 of the Per-
sonal Health Information Protection Act, the Institute for Clini-
cal Evaluative Sciences can receive and use health information
without consent for purposes of analysis and compiling statis-
tical information about the Canadian health care system.
Study Participants
From January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2014, we identified
96 676 patients who were residents of Ontario and had a diag-
nosis of breast cancer in the Ontario Cancer Registry (eTable 2
in the Supplement). We excluded 837 cases (0.9%) that were
coded as nonfemale or unknown sex, or where the death date
was earlier than diagnosis date. Of the remaining cases, we ex-
cluded the following: women younger than 20 years and 45
years or older at the index date of diagnosis (82 744 [85.6%]),
women with a history of hysterectomy or oophorectomy (3164
[3.3%]), women with a history of previous cancer (except skin
cancer)(396[0.4%]),andwomenwithstage0orunknownstage
breastcancer(1982[2.1%]),leaving7553womeneligibleforthe
study. For each woman in the study population, we retrieved
information on the following: age at diagnosis, date of diagno-
sis, American Joint Commission on Cancer pathologic stage at
diagnosis, ER, PR, ERBB2/HER2 (OMIM 164870) status, che-
motherapy (yes or no), and radiotherapy (yes or no).
Exposures and Outcomes
The exposure was any pregnancy in the period from 5 years
before, until 5 years after, the index date of diagnosis of breast
cancer (eTable 3 in the Supplement). For each woman, we con-
structed a pregnancy history for the period of 5 years before,
until 5 years after, diagnosis of breast cancer (eFigure 1 in the
Supplement). For women who had a live birth (or a stillbirth),
we calculated the date of conception by subtracting 9 months
from the date of delivery, assuming a span of 40 weeks for a
full-term pregnancy. For a woman who had an abortion, the
dateofconceptionwascalculatedbysubtracting3monthsfrom
the date of the procedure code.
We classified women into 4 exposure groups (eFigure 2 in
the Supplement). The first group, no pregnancy, was defined as
womenwhohadnoconceptionfrom5yearsbefore,until5years
after, the index date of their diagnosis. The second group, preg-
nancybeforebreastcancer,wasdefinedaswomenwhohadcon-
ception from 5 years to 1 year before the index date of their di-
agnosisofbreastcancer.Thethirdgroup,pregnancy-associated
breastcancer,wasdefinedaswomenwhohadconceptionfrom
11 months before, until 21 months after, the index date of their
diagnosis. The fourth group, pregnancy following breast cancer,
was defined as women who had conception from 22 to 60
months after the index date of their diagnosis.
Asoftheendofstudyfollow-up,weclassifiedeachwoman
as alive, dead from breast cancer, dead from another cause,
or dead from an unknown cause. The primary outcome was
5-year overall survival.
Statistical Analysis
The baseline characteristics of women according to exposure
group were compared using descriptive statistics. We used the
Key Points
Question Does pregnancy increase the risk of death in women
with breast cancer?
Findings In this cohort study of 7553 women with breast cancer,
the 5-year overall survival was 87.5% for women with no
pregnancy, 82.1% for women with pregnancy-associated breast
cancer, and 96.7% for women who had pregnancy 6 months or
more after diagnosis of breast cancer. The difference in survival
between pregnancy groups was not statistically significant.
Meaning Pregnancy around the time of, or after, diagnosis of
breast cancer, does not worsen survival.

We defined overall survival as the period from the date of
diagnosis of breast cancer to the date of death from any cause.
We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate actuarial sur-
vival by exposure group. The log-rank test was used to com-
pare survival rates between strata. We used the Cox propor-

women with pregnancy before breast cancer and women with

proportional hazards regression models for women with abor-
tion only and for women with live birth only (or stillbirth). We
performed age-adjusted and multivariable models. The multi-
variable models included the year of diagnosis, age at diagno-
sis, cancer stage at diagnosis, ER, PR, and ERBB2/HER2 status,
radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and pregnancy exposure group.
We performed a time-dependent analysis for women with
pregnancy following breast cancer.27-29 In the model, preg-
nancy was considered as a time-dependent covariate whereby
exposure status was transferred from nonexposed to ex-
posed at the date of conception. The immortal time (from di-
agnosis to conception) was combined with person-years in the
unexposed group (nonpregnant women).
For all estimates, P ≤ .05 was considered statistically sig-
nificant. All P values were 2-tailed. SAS, version 9.2 (SAS In-
stitute Inc), was used for all statistical analyses.
Results
We identified 7553 women with invasive breast cancer who
were eligible for study entry; eTable 4 in the Supplement pre-
sents the baseline characteristics of the participants. The mean
age at diagnosis of breast cancer was 39.1 years (median, 40
years; range, 20-44 years). The mean follow-up time was 5.2
years (median, 5.0 years; range, 0-11.2 years). Of all women,
5832 (77.2%) had no pregnancy, 1202 (15.9%) had 1 preg-
nancy, 398 (5.3%) had 2 pregnancies, and 121 (1.6%) had 3
pregnancies or more from 5 years before, until 5 years after,
the index date of diagnosis of breast cancer. eTable 5 in the
Supplementpresentsdetailsonparity;1302women(17.2%)had
a live birth, 14 (0.2%) had a stillbirth, and 700 (9.3%) had an
abortion. eFigures 3 to 9 in the Supplement show the preva-
lence of pregnancy, abortion, and live birth in the 7553 women
in the study from 5 years before, until 5 years after, the index
date of diagnosis according to different age groups. A total of
700women(9.3%)hadanabortionfrom5yearsprior,to5years
after, diagnosis of breast cancer. Most abortions (94%) oc-
curred before the diagnosis (eFigure 4 in the Supplement).
Breast Cancer Characteristics
eTable 6 in the Supplement presents baseline characteristics
of breast cancers according to pregnancy group. Of 7553
women,5832(77.2%)hadnopregnancy,1108(14.7%)hadpreg-
nancy before breast cancer, 501 (6.6%) had pregnancy-
associated breast cancer, and 112 (1.5%) had pregnancy fol-
lowingbreastcancer.Womenwithpregnancy-associatedbreast
cancer were more likely than women with no pregnancy to be
diagnosed with stage II to IV breast cancer (77.8% vs 71.5%;
P < .001), to have node-positive tumors (52.1% vs 47.7%;
P = .02),tohaveER-negativetumors(36.5%vs23.2%;P < .001),
and to have triple-negative tumors (27.3% vs 16.8%; P = .001).

all-cause mortality for women who had an abortion.
Pregnancy Following Breast Cancer
In this model, pregnancy was incorporated as a time-
dependent variable. Women with pregnancy following breast
cancer were considered to be unexposed from the date of di-
agnosis to the date of conception and exposed from the date
of conception. The 5-year actuarial survival rate was 96.7%
(95% CI, 94.1%-99.3%) for women who had a live birth or still-
birth 6 months or more after diagnosis of breast cancer (vs
87.5% [95% CI, 86.5%-88.4%] for women with no pregnancy)
(age-adjusted HR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.10-0.49; P < .001) (eTable
11 in the Supplement). The annual absolute mortality rate for
women who had live birth or stillbirth 6 months or more after
diagnosis was 0.5%.
Survival After Pregnancy-Associated Breast Cancer
Among women with pregnancy-associated breast cancer who
had a live birth or stillbirth, we examined features that affect
survival(eTable12intheSupplement).Comparedwithwomen
aged 40 to 44 years, the multivariable HR for all-cause mor-
tality was poorer for women aged 20 to 29 years (2.06; 95%
CI, 0.68-6.28; P = .20) and for women aged 30 to 34 years (1.71;
95% CI, 0.61-4.83; P = .31). The multivariable HR was lower for
women with ER-positive tumors vs ER-negative tumors (0.37;
95%CI,0.04-3.37;P = .38).eFigure11intheSupplementshows
the unadjusted Kaplan-Meier survival curves in women with
pregnancy-associated breast cancer according to age groups.
Discussion
We conducted this study to determine whether pregnancy has
an adverse effect on survival in women with breast cancer and
found that a pregnancy simultaneous with breast cancer was
not detrimental to survival. The 5-year age-adjusted HR of all-
cause mortality was marginally higher for women with preg-
nancy-associatedbreastcancervsthosewithnopregnancy(1.18;
P = .20). The age-adjusted HR did not change substantially in

themultivariablemodel(1.11;P = .41).Wedemonstratedthatthe
strong age effect observed here may explain the survival dis-
advantage in this group reported in the past. We also demon-
stratedthatapregnancyfollowingdiagnosisofbreastcancerwas
not detrimental to survival. In particular, compared with non-
pregnant women, the risk of death significantly dropped for
womenwhodelivered6monthsormoreafterdiagnosisofbreast
cancer (multivariable HR, 0.25 [eTable 11 in the Supplement]).
Our estimates for pregnancy-associated breast cancer are
similar to those of 2 previous population-based cohort stud-
ies that adjusted their hazard models for tumor
characteristics13,14 and chemotherapy14 but not for radio-
therapy. In a European collaborative study, Amant and
colleagues14 compared 447 cases of pregnancy-associated
breast cancer with 865 cases of breast cancer in women who
were not pregnant. The 5-year adjusted HR of overall mortal-
ity for women with pregnancy-associated breast cancer vs
those who were not pregnant was 1.19 (95% CI, 0.73-1.93;
P = .51). Rodriguez and colleagues13 using the California Can-
cer Registry reported a similar estimate of the adjusted HR for
women with pregnancy-associated breast cancer (1.14; 95% CI,
1.00-1.29; P = .05).
Many have proposed that pregnancy may adversely affect
survival in women with breast cancer when the 2 conditions
occurtogether.30-35Ourstudyquestionsthisposition.Wedem-
onstrated a strong effect of age on survival in all hazard esti-
mates. For pregnant women vs those who were not pregnant,
the unadjusted HR was 1.50, which fell to 1.18 when we ad-
justed for age alone. Adjusting for factors other than age did
not substantially change the HR estimates. In a population-
basedstudyoftheSwedishCancerRegistry,Johanssonandcol-
leagues also reported a strong effect of age on HR estimates;
in their study, unadjusted HR fell from 1.47 to an age-adjusted
HRof1.18.12Ithasbeenproposedthatbreastcancerduringpreg-

the fetus.36,37 We show that the principal underlying factor for
poor prognosis is early age of diagnosis of breast cancer.
We identified that, among women with pregnancy-
associated breast cancer, younger women had relatively poor
overall survival. Compared with the nonpregnant women, the
age-adjusted HR of all-cause mortality was 1.93 for women
younger than 30 years, and 1.75 for women aged 30 to 34 years
(eTable 12 in the Supplement). The HRs remained high in these
age groups after adjusting for tumor characteristics and treat-
ment, at 2.06 and 1.71, respectively. Amant and colleagues14
reported similar estimates. It is well documented that young
age is independently associated with poor breast cancer
survival.38-41 In our study, among women with pregnancy-
associated breast cancer, the proportion with more advanced
(stages II-IV) breast cancer was 87.9% for women younger than
30 years, 83.3% for women aged 30 to 34 years, and 76.1% for
women aged 35 to 39 years, compared with 62.6% for women
40 years and older (P < .001). The corresponding proportions
ofER-negativetumorsfortheseagegroupswere22.7%,20.2%,
16.8%, and 10.8%, respectively (P = .02).
Women with pregnancy-associated breast cancers were
more likely than nonpregnant women to have ER-negative tu-
mors (36.5% vs 23.2%; P < .001). The age-adjusted HR for ER-
negative tumors (vs ER-positive) was 3.30 (95% CI, 1.14-9.55;
P = .02).Themechanismbywhichthehormonalmilieuofpreg-
nancy could give rise to a higher proportion of ER-negative
breast cancers is unclear. Possible explanations are that preg-
nancy might prevent ER-positive breast cancers, pregnancy
mightincreasetheriskofER-negativebreastcancers,andpreg-
nancy might switch an ER-positive breast cancer to ER-
negative cancer.
Our finding that pregnancy 6 months after diagnosis of
breast cancer is safe is consistent with results of 3 previous co-
hort studies.19,20,42 Mueller and colleagues19 reported an ad-
justed relative risk of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.2-2.6) for death for women
who had a live birth within 3 months after diagnosis of breast
cancer(vsnopregnancy);therelativeriskdroppedto0.38(95%
CI, 0.12-1.2) for women who delivered within 7 to 9 months
afterdiagnosisofbreastcancer.InanAustralianstudy,Ivesand
colleagues42 reported an adjusted HR of 2.20 for women who
had a pregnancy less than 6 months after diagnosis of breast
cancer, 0.45 for women who had a pregnancy 6 to 24 months
afterdiagnosis,and0.48forwomenwhohadapregnancymore
than 24 months after diagnosis, compared with nonpregnant
women. In our time-dependent analysis, the age-adjusted HR
of all-cause mortality was 0.22 (P < .001) for women who had
live birth or stillbirth 6 months after the index date of diagno-
sis of breast cancer. The HR remained unchanged in the mul-
tivariable model. The apparent survival benefit in women with
pregnancy following breast cancer (vs nonpregnant women)
mightbeowingtosomedegreeoftheso-calledhealthymother
effect, in which women who conceive are most likely to be a
self-selected group of healthy women with better prognoses.
Limitations
Our study has some limitations. The Ontario Cancer Registry
has no information on the tumor size, nodal status, ER or PR
status, and ERBB2/HER2 status for cases of breast cancer that
were diagnosed before 2010. For women who had a live or still-
birth, the information on gestational weeks was available only
for deliveries after April 2002. Gestational weeks were not
available for most women who had an abortion. We calcu-
lated an approximate date of conception, which could under-
estimate or overestimate, the actual time of conception. Fi-
nally, we were unable to obtain information on the use of
hormonal treatment (eg, tamoxifen). Despite these limita-
tions, to our knowledge, our study is one of the largest to date
on this subject. The major strength of our study was our abil-
ity to link the Ontario Cancer Registry database to other health
administrative databases of Ontario. Therefore, our cohort was
representative of the entire population of Ontario. Moreover,
we adjusted the hazard model for both chemotherapy and ra-
diotherapy. Furthermore, we performed a time-dependent
analysis in which we calculated the survival from the date of
conception, rather than the date of diagnosis.
Conclusions
Pregnancy did not adversely affect survival in women with
breast cancer. The ER status is the strongest factor that dis-
criminates between pregnancy-associated breast cancer and
breast cancer in nonpregnant women. However, adjusting for
theERstatusdidnotinfluencetheriskofdeath.Forbreastcan-
cer survivors who wish to conceive, the risk of death is lowest
if pregnancy occurs 6 months or more after diagnosis.
