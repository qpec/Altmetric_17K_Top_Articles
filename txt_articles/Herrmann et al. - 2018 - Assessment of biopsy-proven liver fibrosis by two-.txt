Two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE) has proven to be efficient for the evaluation of liver fibrosis in small to
moderate-sized clinical trials. We aimed at running a larger-scale meta-analysis of individual data. Centers which have worked with
Aixplorer ultrasound equipment were contacted to share their data. Retrospective statistical analysis used direct and paired receiver
operating characteristic and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analyses, accounting for random effects.
Data on both 2D-SWE and liver biopsy were available for 1,134 patients from 13 sites, as well as on successful transient elastography
in 665 patients. Most patients had chronic hepatitis C (n 5 379), hepatitis B (n 5 400), or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (n 5 156).
AUROCs of 2D-SWE in patients with hepatitis C, hepatitis B, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease were 86.3%, 90.6%, and 85.5%
for diagnosing significant fibrosis and 92.9%, 95.5%, and 91.7% for diagnosing cirrhosis, respectively. The AUROC of 2D-SWE was
0.022-0.084 (95% confidence interval) larger than the AUROC of transient elastography for diagnosing significant fibrosis
(P 5 0.001) and 0.003-0.034 for diagnosing cirrhosis (P 5 0.022) in all patients. This difference was strongest in hepatitis B patients.
Conclusion: 2D-SWE has good to excellent performance for the noninvasive staging of liver fibrosis in patients with hepatitis B; further
prospective studies are needed for head-to-head comparison between 2D-SWE and other imaging modalities to establish disease-
specific appropriate cutoff points for assessment of fibrosis stage. (HEPATOLOGY 2018;67:260-272).

hronic liver diseases can cause a sustained or
intermittent inflammation of the liver associated
with a healing process, leading to progressive
fibrosis and finally to cirrhosis.(1) Patients with cirrhosis
are at risk of developing complications, including esopha-
geal varices, ascites, liver failure, encephalopathy, and
hepatocellular carcinoma.(2) Accurate assessment of the
severity of liver fibrosis and a reliable diagnosis of cirrho-
sis are important steps for the management of patients
with chronic liver diseases as they provide information
that guides therapeutic decisions.(1,2) For decades liver
biopsy has been used as the reference standard for staging
liver fibrosis. Liver biopsy, however, is an invasive
method associated with patient discomfort, cost, and
rarely serious complications.(3) In addition, its accuracy is
limited due to intraobserver and interobserver variability
and sampling error.(4) In recent years, research has
focused on the evaluation of noninvasive methods for the
assessment of liver fibrosis.(5) The most intensively evalu-
ated noninvasive method is the measurement of liver

elastography,
and
two-
dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE).(6,7)
The most extensively evaluated elastographic method for
liver stiffness is TE (FibroScan; Echosens, Paris, France).
It was first on the market and has good diagnostic accu-
racy of at least significant liver fibrosis and excellent diag-
nostic accuracy of liver cirrhosis.(6,8-11) However, the
method is limited by a high rate of unreliable results
(15%-20%).(12) 2D-SWE based on supersonic shear
imaging
(SuperSonic
Imagine;
Aixplorer,
Aix-en-
Provence, France) is an elastographic technique with the
following differences from TE: (1) integration into a con-
ventional ultrasound imaging machine with conventional
ultrasound probes during a routine ultrasound scan, (2)
exact localization of the region of interest during B-mode
ultrasound, (3) no limitation of stiffness measurement in
patients with ascites, and (4) performance of real-time
2D-SWE as the shear waves are generated by ultrasound
pushes and their propagation is recorded at a higher
frame rate than in conventional ultrasound imaging devi-
ces.(13,14) In contrast, TE has the advantage of improved
portability. The real-time imaging also allows assesse-
ment of the stability of the measurement and quantifica-
tion of an average value of stiffness in a large region of
interest for higher reliability. 2D-SWE has proven to be
efficient for the evaluation of liver fibrosis in several small
to moderate-sized trials, which reported equivalent to
superior diagnostic accuracies compared to TE and point
SWE for the assessment of liver fibrosis.(15-20)

 In this meta-analysis we aimed at collecting a large
pool of individual patient data in order to assess the
value of 2D-SWE for staging liver fibrosis in patients
with chronic liver diseases of various etiologies using
liver biopsy as a reference. As a second objective we
also aimed to compare the diagnostic performance of
2D-SWE with that of TE.
Materials and Methods
This meta-analysis was not based on a systematic
review of published results. Instead, clinical centers
that have worked with Aixplorer ultrasound equipment
and with known experience with it were contacted and
proposed to participate in the retrospective analysis by
contributing patients’ data from their centers. Hereby,
patients’ data, which were already published as center-
based studies, were accepted.(15-20) Published data of
centers not participating in this study are compared in
the discussion.
Information on hepatology centers with experience
in the use of 2D-SWE for liver stiffness measure-
ments was brought by SuperSonic Imagine and the
other study contributors. Selection criteria were (1)
chronic liver disease patients undergoing a liver ultra-
sound examination including 2D-SWE with the
Aixplorer, (2) age 18 years or older, and (3) a recent
liver biopsy for histological evaluation of fibrosis.
Liver biopsy and histopathological analysis were
staged locally at each center with pathologists blinded
to the results of 2D-SWE in all centers. All fibrosis
stages were converted to METAVIR, where stages 2
or worse is categorized as significant fibrosis, stage 3
or worse is categorized as severe fibrosis, and stage 4
corresponds to liver cirrhosis without reassessing
pathological reports.(21) The histological fibrosis stage
was used as the gold standard for analysis. Brunt stea-
tosis score was also used.(22)
Exclusion criteria included (1) age below 18 years,
(2) previous liver transplantation, (3) no 2D-SWE
measurements reported or 2D-SWE technical fail-
ures, (4) time between liver biopsy and 2D-SWE of
more than 24 weeks, and (5) liver biopsy samples
smaller than 10 mm or having fewer than six portal
tracts.
Centers were asked to share the following data (see
also Table 1):
�
demographic and clinical data (gender, age, height,
weight, body mass index, presence of metabolic
syndrome, diabetes mellitus, ascites, fasting status,
liver disease etiology)
�
results of 2D-SWE measurement (date of assess-
ment, number of measurements)
�
results of liver biopsy (date of liver biopsy, histo-
logical liver fibrosis stage, length of biopsy samples,
number of portal tracts, grade of inflammation,
and steatosis)
�
laboratory data, which were converted into uni-
form units: platelet counts (109/L), urea (milli-
moles per liter), creatinine (micromoles per liter),
aspartate aminotransferase (international units per
liter),
alanine
aminotransferase
(international
units per liter), gamma-glutamyltransferase (inter-
national units per liter), alkaline phosphatases
(international units per liter), a2-macroglobulin
(grams per liter), apolipoprotein A1 (grams per
liter), triglyceride (millimoles per liter), fasting
blood glucose (millimoles per liter), high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (millimoles per liter), low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol (millimoles per
liter), total cholesterol (millimoles per liter), bili-
rubin (micromoles per liter), haptoglobin (grams
per liter), albumin (grams per deciliter), pro-
thrombin index, international normalized ratio,
C-reactive protein
�
if available, results on TE measurement (date,
number of measurements, median of measure-
ments, interquartile range [IQR])
All data were checked for using the same scaling.
Inconsistencies were found for albumin and IQR of
TE and corrected accordingly.
The database was cleared by the French National
Commission on Information Technology and Liber-
ties, and the study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov
(NCT02181452).

 tissue stiffness expressed in kilopascals or of shear wave
velocity in tissue expressed in meters per second. This
map is displayed in color over a conventional gray-
scale B-mode image. The size and position of the
SWE map and the circular region of interest used for
stiffness/velocity
measurement
are operator-adjust-
able.(7,17,19,20) 2D-SWE acquisitions were performed
on fasting patients at all sites, with patients in the
supine position. For each patient, 1-10 2D-SWE
measurements (depending on the standard procedure
at each center) were performed in the right liver lobe
with an intercostal approach. As suggested by the
manufacturer, the measurement was performed 1-2 cm
under the liver capsule, in an area of parenchyma. The
mean and standard deviation within the region of
interest were recorded. Technical failure was defined as
the inability to obtain a successful SWE measurement.
If more than one 2D-SWE measurement were
reported, the median was used for further evaluations.
TRANSIENT ELASTOGRAPHY
One-dimensional TE was carried out using the
FibroScan. This technique uses low-frequency (50 Hz)
mechanically generated shear waves whose propagation
velocity is measured with an ultrasound beam. The
pulse-echo ultrasound captures the shear wave propa-
gation velocity and provides an average stiffness mea-
surement. The procedure was performed through the
intercostal space in the right liver lobe at a mea-
surement depth of 25-65 mm (M probe) or 35-75 mm
(XL probe) in all but two sites (GR, FR2), where
only the M probe was used. Details have been pub-
lished.(6-11) We used only TE results reported as suc-
cessful
measurements
and
which
had
an
IQR/
median �0.3.(24)
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The evaluated population is neither per-protocol nor
intention-to-diagnose in a strict sense due to the retro-
spective nature of this meta-analysis.
In order to optimize cutoff points, a random effect
model was used to estimate the receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the
ROC curve (AUROC). Therefore, we estimated sensi-
tivity and specificity for each potential cutoff point. A
DerSimonian and Laird random effect model using
arcsin transformations of proportions was performed
to obtain the ROC curve and the AUROC. As usual,
we categorized the AUROC as excellent if it was above
90%, as good for values between 80% and 90%, and as
fair for values between 70% and 80%. For estimating
the AUROC values, we used this random effect esti-
mator with all data. To assess risk of bias and small
study effects, we analyzed individual AUROC values
for potential trends. Furthermore, risk of bias from
selecting data with liver biopsy only was assessed by
comparing the results including data from patients
with known liver cirrhosis from their clinical history.
In addition, nonparametric rank correlation between
2D-SWE measurements and fibrosis stages were cal-
culated at each site, and a stratified test was used to
test for statistical significance.
Nevertheless, because of the relatively large data set
and the high heterogeneity in the prevalence of the
different fibrosis stages, we included aspects of an
Obuchowski analysis(25) for diagnosing an ordinal but
nonbinary scaled endpoint when optimizing cutoff
points as follows: to estimate an optimal cutoff point
for diagnosing significant fibrosis, only data from
patients with fibrosis stage 0-2 were used. Similarly,
only data from patients with fibrosis stage 2-3 were
used to optimize a cutoff point for diagnosing severe
fibrosis, and only data from patients with fibrosis stage
3 or cirrhosis were used to optimize a cutoff point for
diagnosing cirrhosis. In all three cases, again random
effect models of the ROC curve directly associated
with specific cutoff points were used, allowing optimi-
zation of the Youden index as in single-center ROC
analyses. In addition, we used the same values across
etiologies as long as this harmonization had only a
minor effect on sensitivities and specificities.
Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio
(DOR) of the proposed cutoff points were then eva-
luated with random effect estimators. Furthermore, the
hierarchical summary ROC approach of Reitsma
et al.(26) was calculated. Prediction failures according to
the proposed cutoff points were analyzed with mixed
effect univariate and multivariable logistic regression.
For a paired analysis of AUROCs of 2D-SWE
and TE, the method of DeLong et al.(27) was used
to estimate differences and standard error of the dif-
ferences between the paired AUROCs at each site,
and a random effect model was used to summarize
the single estimates and obtain an overall P value
and 95% confidence interval. As hepatitis B virus
(HBV) patients may need different cutoff levels,
analysis was stratified according to HBV and non-
HBV patients at the single sites. Risk of bias at the
individual sites was optimized by using only TE
results reported as successful measurements and

 which had an IQR/median �0.3. Furthermore, fun-
nel plots were analyzed for asymmetries.
All statistical tests were two-sided with a signifi-
cance level of a 5 5%. Analysis was performed with
R (version 3.0.2; R Foundation for Statistical Comput-
ing, Vienna, Austria) using especially the meta package
of Guido Schwarzer (version 4.1-0), the coin package
of Hothorn et al. (version 1.0-23), the pROC package
of Robin et al.(28) (version 1.5.4), and the mada pack-
age of Philipp Doebler (version 0.5.4).
Results
A total of 1,134 patients from 13 clinical sites were
included in the final analysis (Fig. 1). The 2D-SWE
data acquisition time spanned from February 2010
until July 2014. Additional data on TE were available
in the majority of patients, of whom 665 had con-
firmed valid measurements (IQR/median <0.3). Main
clinical characteristics are given in Table 1 and
Supporting Table S1. Liver disease etiologies were cat-
egorized into chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV, n 5
379) or HBV (n 5 400) infection, nonalcoholic fatty
liver disease (NAFLD, n 5 156), and a group of
“other liver diseases” (n 5 199), where the latter
mainly included patients with alcoholic liver disease.
Figure 2 illustrates that there was a high diversity in
the etiologies of liver diseases and in the prevalence of
fibrosis stages among the different contributing centers
(P < 0.001 in both comparisons).
2D-SWE MEASUREMENTS
There was a strong correlation between fibrosis
stages and 2D-SWE measurements (Supporting Fig.
S1). Spearman rank correlation coefficients varied
between 0.45 and 0.80 in all clinical sites, except for
one sites with a small number of cases and a correlation
coefficient of 0.27 (P < 0.001 for the overall correla-
tion by a stratified permutation test using all centers).

 DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE
OF 2D-SWE
The diagnostic performance of 2D-SWE was
assessed with different random effect methods, which
all account for the heterogeneity between the sites. See
Supporting Fig. S2 for an illustration of this heteroge-
neity by showing ROC curves for each site. As assess-
ment of risk of bias from small sites, we analyzed
funnel plots of individual AUROC estimates. There
were no indications of larger individual AUROCs in
sites with small numbers of cases (data not shown).
We estimated ROC curves and AUROC for diagnos-
ing significant fibrosis, severe fibrosis, and cirrhosis,
respectively. Diagnostic performances according to the
AUROC values were good to excellent for the diagno-
sis of significant fibrosis and excellent for the diagnosis
of severe fibrosis and cirrhosis. See Fig. 3 for more
details including the AUROC values in the whole
population as well as for the different liver disease
etiologies.
Some centers did not perform liver biopsy in
patients with known liver cirrhosis from the patient’s
clinical history. We did not include these patients (n 5
147), but excluding them may lead to focusing on less
severe cirrhosis patients here. To analyze a potential
bias, we performed an additional analysis including
these patients and obtained AUROCs for diagnosing
cirrhosis above 95% for all liver disease etiologies
(results not shown).
When selecting suitable cutoff points, we focused
on the differentiation between neighboring fibrosis
stages to account for the ordinal scale. This data selec-
tion was only done in the context of cutoff point selec-
tion and not when evaluating them afterward. The
optimized cutoff points as well as sensitivity, specific-
ity, and DOR of the corresponding proposed cutoff
points are shown in Table 2. The proposed cutoff
points slightly differ from the optimal ones. In
NAFLD patients, sample size was too low to reliably
optimize cutoff values. Nevertheless, sample size was
still large enough to show that 2D-SWE results in the
specific fibrosis stages in NAFLD patients were com-
parable to those in HCV patients. For all other
patients, the proposed overall cutoff point for diagnos-
ing significant fibrosis was 7.1 kPa, regardless of dis-
ease etiology. For diagnosing severe fibrosis and
cirrhosis, a slightly lower cutoff point was found for
patients infected with HBV (8.1 kPa and 11.5 kPa,
respectively) compared to all other patients (9.2 kPa
and 13.0 kPa, respectively). These cutoff points lead to

 estimated DORs of 7.3-15.4 for significant fibrosis,
8.9-18.6 for severe fibrosis, and 7.5-37.5 for cirrhosis.
Overall, diagnostic performance was better in HBV
and HCV patients than in patients without viral
hepatitis.
The positive and negative predictive values and the
overall correct classification rate could be estimated
only indirectly as they depend on the prevalence of
fibrosis stages. Assuming a prevalence of 22.1% signifi-
cant fibrosis, 15.9% severe fibrosis, and 16.2% cirrhosis
as in our total study population, the overall correct
classification rates were 69.7%, 89.3%, and 82.9% for
significant fibrosis, severe fibrosis, and liver cirrhosis,
respectively. Analogously, the positive predictive value
was estimated at 65.1%, 77.0%, and 48.3% and the
negative predictive value at 86.7%, 97.4%, and 95.4%,
respectively.
As an alternative method, a parametric hierarchical
summary ROC analysis is shown in Supporting Table
S2 and Fig. S3. In summary, sensitivities and, espe-
cially, specificities were less optimistic.
DISCORDANT CASES
In order to assess potential factors for prediction
failure (discordant results between 2D-SWE and liver
biopsy
as
reference
method),
univariate
and
multivariable random effect logistic regression analyses
were used (see Supporting Information). These analy-
ses demonstrate that the respective factors when com-
bined with 2D-SWE prediction may lead to a slight
but significant improvement of predicting significant
fibrosis, severe fibrosis, or cirrhosis, respectively.
COMPARISON OF DIAGNOSTIC
PERFORMANCE OF 2D-SWE
AND TE
Paired measurements of 2D-SWE and TE were
available in the majority of patients. The statistical
analysis was restricted to the 665 patients with con-
firmed TE success and IQR/median <0.3 (Supporting
Table S3 for patient characteristics of this subcohort
which includes 271 patients with HCV, 206 with
HBV, 91 with NAFLD, and 97 with other liver dis-
ease etiologies). In HCV, HBV, or NAFLD patients,
AUROCs were 4.2%-11.2% larger using 2D-SWE for
the diagnosis of significant fibrosis (absolute differ-
ences, P < 0.001 in HBV patients, P 5 0.001 for
combining data from all etiologies; Supporting Table
S3). AUROCs were 1.4%-12.8% larger using 2D-
SWE for the diagnosis of severe fibrosis (P 5 0.003 in
NAFLD patients, P 5 0.035 for all patients). For the

 diagnosis of cirrhosis, AUROCs were about 1.4%-
6.7% larger using 2D-SWE versus TE (P 5 0.007 in
HBV patients, P 5 0.022 for all patients). In general,
the gain in AUROC with 2D-SWE when compared
with TE was largest in HBV patients and smallest in
HCV patients. More detailed data are given in Table
3. In all reported situations, the diagnostic perfor-
mance of 2D-SWE was better than that of TE even if
the differences were mostly small and not significant in
several subanalyses. Figure 4 shows the forest plots for
the difference in AUROC between 2D-SWE and TE
for the different sites and the overall estimates in HBV
and HCV patients. Although the largest HBV patient
cohorts were from Asia, the European sites showed
very comparable performance. Funnel plots did not
show any indication of bias effects for sites with small
sample sizes (data not shown).
Discussion
Because of the known drawbacks of liver biopsy,(4)
noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis is of increasing
importance.
At present, the accuracy of 2D-SWE for the nonin-
vasive assessment of liver fibrosis was evaluated in
studies including patients infected with chronic hepati-
tis C(14,17) or chronic hepatitis B(19,20) and in NAFLD
patients(29,30) and studies pooling patients with differ-
ent chronic liver diseases.(15,16,19) Nevertheless, no
results from a large-scale multicenter study using liver
biopsy as a reference are available. We performed a ret-
rospective individual patient data meta-analysis based
on a data set of 1,134 patients. Nevertheless, just pool-
ing the data would not be reasonable because of the
heterogeneity between the clinical sites and different
liver disease etiologies, which reflects different implicit
or explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria at the single
sites. Therefore, we assessed the diagnostic perfor-
mance using refined statistical methods that account
for the inherent heterogeneity. The large sample size
also enabled us to perform subgroup analyses for single
liver diseases and optimization of cutoff levels to esti-
mate the different stages of liver fibrosis. Nevertheless,
when comparing 2D-SWE with TE in the present
study, the limitation of its retrospective nature with
partially incomplete information on examination qual-
ity and characteristics has to be considered. To account
for this limitation, we only used TE assessments
with reported success and IQR/median <0.3 for the
comparisons.
In a previous study among 121 HCV patients with a
liver biopsy as a reference method, 2D-SWE demon-
strated excellent diagnostic accuracies for all fibrosis
stages (AUROC, 92%, 98%, and 98% for the diagnosis
of significant fibrosis, severe fibrosis, and liver cir-
rhosis, respectively) and was superior to TE for the
diagnosis of significant fibrosis.(17) This corresponds
reasonably well with our results with AUROCs of
86%, 92%, and 93% for the diagnosis of significant or
severe fibrosis and liver cirrhosis in HCV patients,
respectively. Overall, 2D-SWE performed well and
showed noninferior performance compared to TE in
our study in this patient group.
More recent studies have evaluated 2D-SWE in
patients infected with chronic hepatitis B (n 5 226
and n 5 303) and revealed diagnostic accuracies
according to AUROC levels of 88%-92%, 93%-95%,
and 95%-98% for significant fibrosis, severe fibrosis,
and liver cirrhosis, respectively.(19,20) Again, this corre-
sponds very well with our results, where AUROCs
were 91%, 93%, and 96% for the diagnosis of signifi-
cant fibrosis, severe fibrosis, and liver cirrhosis in HBV
patients, respectively. In one study, 2D-SWE was
compared to TE, and the diagnostic accuracies were
significantly superior to TE for all fibrosis stages.(20) In
our study, 2D-SWE was also better than TE for the
diagnosis of all fibrosis stages and significantly better
for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis and liver cirrho-
sis (P < 0.001 and P 5 0.007, respectively).
The assessment of liver fibrosis with elastographic
methods in general can be challenging in NAFLD
patients.(30) Our data set was sparse in patients with
NAFLD. A recent study enrolled 291 NAFLD pa-
tients and compared the performance of 2D-SWE,
TE, and virtual touch quantification using liver biopsy
as a reference method.(29) 2D-SWE had AUROCs of
86%, 89%, and 88% for the diagnosis of significant
fibrosis, severe fibrosis and liver cirrhosis, respectively.
This is slightly less favorable than the AUROCs of
86%, 93%, and 92% observed in our study in this
patient group for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis,
severe fibrosis, and liver cirrhosis, respectively. Never-
theless, 2D-SWE results were, overall, comparable to
those derived from TE in NAFLD patients in our
subgroup as well as in the study of Cassinotto et al.(29)
In three previous studies including patients with
mixed chronic liver disease with 170-349 patients,
diagnostic accuracies of 81%-90%, 80%-96%, and
85%-99% were reported for significant fibrosis, severe
fibrosis, and liver cirrhosis, respectively.(15,16,18) We
estimated AUROCs over all liver disease etiologies of
HEPATOLOGY, Vol. 67, No. 1, 2018
HERRMANN ET AL.
269
 86%, 91%, and 93% for the diagnosis of significant
fibrosis, severe fibrosis, and liver cirrhosis, respectively.
While 2D-SWE was superior to TE for the diagnosis
of severe fibrosis in the larger study,(15) it was equiva-
lent in the smaller study.(18) In our study, analyzing the
whole patient group but stratifying for HBV and non-
HBV patients, 2D-SWE was significantly better than
TE for diagnosing significant fibrosis, severe fibrosis,
and liver cirrhosis (P 5 0.001, P 5 0.035, and P 5
0.022, respectively).
In NAFLD patients, sample size was too low to
optimize cutoff values. For all other patients, we pro-
pose a cutoff value for diagnosing significant fibrosis of
7.1 kPa, a value for diagnosing severe fibrosis of
9.2 kPa in all but HBV patients, and a value of 8.1 in
HBV patients. Furthermore, we propose a cutoff value
for diagnosing cirrhosis of 13.0 kPa in all but HBV
patients and 11.5 kPa in HBV patients. These values
are, overall, similar to that proposed previously. It may
simplify the noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis
with 2D-SWE to choose identical cutoff values
between most of the liver diseases and potentially pre-
vent mistakes by ignoring the specific liver disease eti-
ology. Nevertheless, according to the relatively low
number of patients with NAFLD and the potentially
suboptimal liver staging method in these patients, the
cutoff values have to be evaluated in further multicen-
ter trials in NAFLD patients.
Meanwhile, alternative 2D-SWEs from other com-
panies are on the market. However, the results and
especially the cutoffs of the present study only account
for 2D-SWE based on supersonic shear imaging
(Aixplorer).
When evaluating factors associated with discordant
results of 2D-SWE and the reference method, espe-
cially in NAFLD, clinical variables such as age, aspar-
tate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and
platelet counts were found to be significant. Neverthe-
less, refining prediction by including these factors has
to be analyzed in a larger study with more homoge-
neous data.
Our individual patient data-based meta-analysis
used patient data from 13 different sites to perform a
larger-scale analysis including optimization and evalua-
tion of cutoff values for 2D-SWE. Even though 2D-
SWE is a promising approach and this individual
patient data meta-analysis allows a more detailed
assessment of the data when compared with literature-
based meta-analyses, our study has, of course, limita-
tions. There may be a risk of bias that the study was
not based on a systematic literature review and mainly
expert centers participated. Nevertheless, no small
sample effect was observed. Further limitations are
caused by the retrospective nature of this study and
small patient numbers for some sites and etiologies.
Also, the majority of HBV patients were from one site
(HK), but the heterogeneity for HBV patients between
sites is comparably small. Furthermore, we have only
incomplete information about the quality of liver
biopsy, the interval between liver biopsy and the 2D-
SWE assessment, the quality of the 2D-SWE meas-
urements themselves, technical failure rates, the experi-
ence of the examiners, as well as on quality parameters
such as IQR and success rate for TE. Up to now, there
has been limited information on recommendations for
obtaining high-quality 2D-SWE measurements and
the necessary number of acquisitions. First, evaluations
show a favorable reproducibility.(31,32) A preliminary
analysis of a subset of our data set with more detailed
data on single acquisitions indicates that reliability is
high even for single measurements. Overall, it may not
be reasonable to apply the recommendations from TE
to the assessment with 2D-SWE. Further detailed
analysis and future studies are needed to answer this
important question.
In addition, we used liver biopsy as a reference
method with liver histology read by local pathologists,
which was transformed to a fibrosis staging with five
stages. The latter is especially problematic in patients
with NAFLD. Liver histology is well known to be
prone to errors by itself. Overall, potentially lower
quality of liver biopsy or 2D-SWE assessments can be
expected to lead to an underestimation of the true
diagnostic performance of the evaluated noninvasive
methods.(4,33) Technical failure rates of 2D-SWE
could not be analyzed here as the information is not
included in the data set. Nevertheless, failure rates or
unreliable results reported in the publications are not
larger than for TE even in NAFLD patients.(29)
In the present study only the two elastographic
methods, 2D-SWE based on supersonic shear imaging
and TE, were evaluated and compared. Nevertheless
other ultrasound-based elastographic techniques have
been evaluated for the assessment of liver fibrosis as
well as other noninvasive methods such as serum bio-
markers, diffusion-weighted computer tomography,
and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE).(5,34)
Meta-analyses of point SWE using virtual touch quan-
tification imaging reported diagnostic accuracies of
84%-87% for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis
(F�2), 89%-91% for the diagnosis of severe fibrosis
(F�3), and 92%-93% for the diagnosis of liver

 cirrhosis (F 5 4).(35,36) Meta-analyses of MRE have
reported diagnostic accuracies of 93%-98% for the
diagnosis of advanced liver fibrosis (F�3) with sensi-
tivities
of
85%-92%
and
specificities
of
85%-
96%.(37,38) In addition, recent studies evaluating MRE
in NALFD patients revealed a diagnostic accuracy of
88%-92% for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis.(39-42)
For diagnosing severe fibrosis, 3D-MRE even reached
98% compared to 92% in 2D-MRE in NAFLD
patients.(41) Comparison of MRE with diffusion-
weighted
imaging
showed
superior
results
for
MRE.(37) However, only few studies have directly
compared MRE to ultrasound-based elastography and
revealed comparable(43) or superior(44,45) results of
MRE to TE. In recent studies in patients with
NAFLD, MRE was significantly better than TE and
better than virtual touch quantification for the diagno-
sis of liver fibrosis.(40,42,46) Direct comparison of 2D-
SWE
with
MRE
showed
similar
diagnostic
performance.(47)
In conclusion, 2D-SWE has good to excellent per-
formance for the noninvasive assessment of liver fibro-
sis in patients with hepatitis B. Further prospective
studies
are
needed
for
head-to-head
comparison
between 2D-SWE and other imaging modalities to
establish disease-specific appropriate cutoff points for
assessment of fibrosis stage.
