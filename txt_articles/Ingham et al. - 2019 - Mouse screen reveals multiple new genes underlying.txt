Abstract
Adult-onset hearing loss is very common, but we know little about the underlying molecular
pathogenesis impeding the development of therapies. We took a genetic approach to iden-
tify new molecules involved in hearing loss by screening a large cohort of newly generated
mouse mutants using a sensitive electrophysiological test, the auditory brainstem response
(ABR). We review here the findings from this screen. Thirty-eight unexpected genes associ-
ated with raised thresholds were detected from our unbiased sample of 1,211 genes tested,
suggesting extreme genetic heterogeneity. A wide range of auditory pathophysiologies was
found, and some mutant lines showed normal development followed by deterioration of
responses, revealing new molecular pathways involved in progressive hearing loss. Several
of the genes were associated with the range of hearing thresholds in the human population
and one, SPNS2, was involved in childhood deafness. The new pathways required for main-
tenance of hearing discovered by this screen present new therapeutic opportunities.
Author summary
Progressive hearing loss with age is extremely common in the population, leading to diffi-
culties in understanding speech, increased social isolation, and associated depression. We
know it has a significant heritability, but so far we know very little about the molecular
pathways leading to hearing loss, hampering the development of treatments. Here, we
describe a large-scale screen of 1,211 new targeted mouse mutant lines, resulting in the
identification of 38 genes underlying hearing loss that were not previously suspected of
involvement in hearing. Some of these genes reveal molecular pathways that may be useful
targets for drug development. Our further analysis of the genes identified and the varied
pathological mechanisms within the ear resulting from the mutations suggests that hearing
loss is an extremely heterogeneous disorder and may have as many as 1,000 genes involved.

 Introduction
Hearing loss is a very common disorder with a significant social impact, including delayed
speech and language development, reduced academic achievement, increased social isolation,
and risk of depression, and has recently been reported to be a major risk factor for dementia
[1], adding new impetus to the need to develop therapies. Approximately 1 in 850 children are
born with permanent hearing impairment in the United Kingdom [2], and the number of peo-
ple affected by adult-onset hearing loss increases with each decade of life, with 60% of people
in their 70s having a hearing loss of 25 dB or worse [3]. Environmental factors including noise
or drug exposure play an important role in its etiology, but there is also a strong genetic contri-
bution. Over 360 genes are known to be involved in human or mouse deafness, but ascertain-
ment bias has led to many of these having early developmental effects, and little is known
about the genetic contribution to adult-onset hearing loss. We set out to identify further genes
underlying deafness, including those with mild effects, using a physiological screen based on
the auditory brainstem response (ABR) in a large cohort of newly generated targeted mouse
mutants. In this report, we review the findings from this screen and present the new data; both
mice and ABR waveform data are available for further analysis. From the unbiased sample of
1,211 genes tested, we found 38 unexpected genes to be involved in hearing impairment. This
indicates that around 600 additional genes remain to be found (see later), making deafness an
extremely heterogeneous condition, with around 1,000 genes that may contribute. The
observed impairments ranged from mild to profound, including several with progressive hear-
ing loss, and with a wide range of underlying pathological mechanisms. The 38 genes represent
a range of functions from transcription factors and a microRNA to enzymes involved in lipid
metabolism. Eleven were found to be significantly associated with auditory function in the
human population, and one gene, SPNS2, was associated with childhood deafness, emphasis-
ing the value of the mouse for identifying genes and mechanisms underlying complex pro-
cesses like hearing.
Results and discussion
Genes involved in auditory sensitivity
We used a rapid (15-minute), noninvasive electrophysiological test, the ABR [4] (S1 Fig; S1
Data) in anaesthetised mice aged 14 weeks old as part of an extensive pipeline of phenotyping
tests on a set of new mouse mutants generated from targeted embryonic stem (ES) cells [5,6,7].
The allele design was mostly the knockout first, conditional-ready (tm1a; targeted mutation,
first allele with design type a [6]) allele, which reduced or eliminated expression of the targeted
gene by inclusion of a large cassette designed to interfere with transcription, but a few were the
derived tm1b allele with an exon deleted or were edited alleles (S1 and S2 Tables). A total of
1,211 genes were tested. Of these, 38 genes with no prior association with deafness had raised
thresholds for detecting a response to sounds (Fig 1; a small number of these have been pub-
lished recently, after their discovery in the screen). Using objective criteria (see Materials and
methods) we classified these 38 genes into five main groups based on thresholds: 5 showed
severe or profound deafness, 10 had raised thresholds at high frequencies only, 2 showed raised
thresholds at low frequencies only, 7 had moderately raised thresholds across frequencies, and
14 had a mild hearing impairment (Fig 1). In addition to these 38 unexpected genes, 10 known
deaf mutant lines were tested as positive controls (S2 Fig A-J; S2 Data), and 9 genes known to
be involved in mouse (Srrm4) or human deafness (MYO7A, MYO15, USH1C, WHRN, ILDR1,
ESPN, CEP250, CLPP) were tested in newly generated alleles; all showed raised thresholds (S1
Table; S2K–S2T Fig; S2 Data).

 Fig 1. Novel genes affecting hearing sensitivity. New mutant mouse lines with hearing impairment categorised as Severe–Profound (A), High frequency (B), Low
frequency (C), Moderate (D), and Mild (E) at 14 weeks old. Mean ABR thresholds (±SD) are plotted for broadband clicks (Ck) and 6 to 30 kHz pure tone stimuli.
On each panel, the green band denotes the 95% reference range for a large population of control wild-type mice derived from littermates of the mutants generated
and tested. Green lines and triangles represent the mean thresholds (±SD) for control mice recorded in the same week as the mutants. Red circles and lines represent
the mean thresholds (±SD) for mutant mice. Thresholds for individual mutants are shown by open grey circles and lines. Gene symbols are given on each plot, and
when both the tm1a and tm1b alleles were screened, both sets of data are presented, indicated by (a) and (b) suffixes. Mice screened were homozygous mutants
except for Brd2, Srsf7, and Setd5, which were screened as heterozygotes due to reduced viability of homozygotes. When no response was detected up to the
maximum dB SPL used (95 dB SPL), the maximum sound level used was plotted. Only 12 of these mutant lines (35%) would have been identified as having a hearing
defect had startle responses alone been used to screen (S1 Table). The number of mutant mice screened of each line is given in column E of S1 Table and on each
panel. A few of these lines (Spns2, Wbp2, Lrig1, Ocm, Mcph1, Pax9, or Slc25a21) have been characterised and published, and others were listed in a summary report

 Of the set of 1,211 genes, 3.14% were new associations with raised auditory thresholds. As
the genes targeted were an unbiased set showing no significant enrichment for any functional
class compared with the total set of mouse genes (see Materials and methods), we can extrapo-
late to estimate that over 600 further genes required for normal auditory thresholds remain to
be found. Added to the 362 human and mouse genes already known and 38 reported here, this
indicates that there may be as many as 1,000 genes involved in deafness, a very high level of
genetic heterogeneity.
There were several targeted genes screened that we expected to show raised thresholds
because they had previously been reported to underlie deafness in either humans (GSDME/
DFNA5, MYH14, MYH9, PNPT1, PRPS1, CHD7) or mice (Barhl1, Fzd6, Hmx3, Nfkb1, Sgms1,
Sms, Synj2). However, the new alleles had normal ABR thresholds (S3 Table). The lack of
raised thresholds could be due to incomplete knockdown of targeted gene expression in the
tm1a allele (e.g., raised thresholds of Selk mutants were seen only in the tm1b allele, not in
tm1a); onset of hearing loss after 14 weeks, when we carried out the screening; screening was
carried out on heterozygotes due to reduced homozygote viability; the genetic background
may have influenced phenotype expression (e.g., Chd7, where the new allele was not viable on
the C57BL/6N background); or the original deafness may have been the result of a specific
effect of the mutation on the protein rather than a consequence of reduced expression (e.g.,
GSDME) (S3 Table). Alternatively, the original allele might have led to deafness via a long-
range cis effect on a nearby gene, as in the Slc25a21tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi targeted mutation, which
causes deafness by reducing expression of Pax9 [8]. Thus, we probably missed additional
genes involved in hearing loss, so our calculation of 600 more genes awaiting association with
deafness may be an underestimate.
All mutant mice reported here are available via public mouse repositories for further inves-
tigation to explore these alternative explanations, and the unprocessed ABR data are available
at the Dryad repository: http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.cv803rv [9]. Of note, all of the mutant
lines that we have studied further following the initial screening results have shown raised
ABR thresholds, even those in the mild class, suggesting that the screen has produced robust,
reproducible calls (mutant lines studied further: Spns2, Zfp719, Ocm, Klhl18, Wbp2, Pex3,
Acsl4, Gpr152, Mcph1, Slc25a21/Pax9, Ywhae, Lrig1, Klc2, Usp42, Srsf7) [8, 10, 11, 12].
Role in human auditory thresholds
As mouse and human inner ears are very similar in structure and function (e.g., [13]), the
newly identified mouse genes represent good candidates for involvement in human deafness.
A child from a United States clinic detected through clinical whole exome sequencing inher-
ited a frameshift mutation of SPNS2 from her father (c.1066_1067delCCinsT: p.Pro356
Cysfs�35; CADD phred score 26) and an in-frame deletion of a serine codon in SPNS2 from
her mother (c.955_957delTCC: p.Ser319del; CADD phred score 20.9). Neither variant has
been reported in the gnomAD database (Genome Aggregation Database; accessed January
2019). Visual reinforcement audiometry at two years old revealed moderate to moderately
severe hearing loss between 250 Hz and 4 kHz with no response at 8 kHz in the right ear,
and severe hearing loss sloping to profound deafness from 500 Hz to 8 kHz with no response
at 4 and 8 kHz in the left ear. Bone conduction testing indicated moderate-severe hearing
loss at 2 kHz in the right ear, suggesting a sensorineural (not conductive) impairment, and
acoustic reflexes were absent. However, the child had surprisingly good sound localisation
significant by the Fisher Exact test but did show raised thresholds when other cohorts were tested later. Plotted data points are given S5 Data. ABR, auditory
brainstem response; Ck, click; SPL, sound pressure level.

 performance. The severe level of hearing impairment associated with predicted damaging
SPNS2 variants is similar to our findings in the mouse Spns2 mutant (Fig 1 in [11]). Further-
more, we have previously reported that deaf children from two families in a Chinese cohort
carried recessive WBP2 mutations [10].
We asked if these new candidates had any role in hearing ability in the general population
by a candidate gene association analysis. We tested genomic markers within 0.1 Mb up- and
downstream of each gene for association with auditory thresholds measured at age 44–45 in
6,099 individuals born during one week in the UK 1958 British Birth Cohort, using genetic
data imputed to the 1,000 Genomes dataset [14]. Eleven of the thirty-seven candidate genes
tested (including SPNS2) showed a significant association of markers with threshold at either 1
or 4 kHz or both frequencies (Table 1), indicating that these 11 genes may play a role in normal
variation of hearing ability in the human population.
These findings emphasise the value of the mouse in resolving complex human diseases,
because very few significant markers have been reported to be linked to hearing through
genome-wide association studies of adult-onset hearing loss directly in humans: GRM7 [15];
PCDH20 and SLC28A3 [16]; ISG20 or ACAN and TRIOBP [17].
Several of the new genes that we found to be involved in deafness in the mouse had human
orthologues close to or within unidentified non-syndromic deafness loci (S4 Table, column J)
and so are good candidates for further exploration. These were USP42 within the DFNB90
interval, BRD2 close to the DFNA21 and DFNA31 loci, CAMSAP3 close to the DFNA57 region,
and MCPH1 very close to the DFNM2 marker reported.
Broad range of gene functions
The 38 genes newly associated with hearing are involved in a broad range of functions,
including transcriptional and translational regulation, chromatin modification, splicing fac-
tors, cytoskeletal proteins, membrane trafficking, calcium buffering, peroxisome biosynthe-
sis, thyroid hormone generation, ubiquitination and deubiquitination, kinases, signaling
molecules (including Wnt signaling), and proteins with no known or predicted function

 (S4 Table). A microRNA gene, Mir122, was one of the new genes underlying hearing
impairment. Seven of the gene products have a role in lipid metabolism: Fads3 is a fatty acid
desaturase; Agap1 and Zcchc14 bind phospholipids; Klc2 transports phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase, which is required for phospholipid processing; Pex3 is involved in biosynthesis of
peroxisomes, which are involved in lipid processing; Acsl4 is a long-chain fatty acid coen-
zyme A ligase converting free long-chain fatty acids into fatty acyl-CoA esters; and Spns2 is
a transporter of sphingosine-1-phosphate, a key intermediate in sphingolipid metabolism
with a role in signalling.
We carried out a GOSlim (high-level version of Gene Ontology) analysis to ask if the genes
newly associated with hearing impairment (n = 38) showed a similar distribution of gene
ontology features to the group of genes previously known to be involved in deafness (n = 362),
and to compare them with all genes tested in this screen (n = 1,211) and a group of genes asso-
ciated with ABR waveform defects (n = 27, described later). The novel genes showed nothing
notably different to the full set of genes screened (Fig 2). However, nearly 70% of previously
known genes had a Gene Ontology (GO) annotation for developmental processes, which was
much higher than in the other groups analysed, suggesting an ascertainment bias for deafness
due to early developmental defects in human and mouse. This finding suggests that our unbi-
ased screen for new genes involved in hearing impairment at all levels of severity has revealed
a fundamentally different class of genes compared with previously known genes underlying
deafness.
Fig 2. GOSlim comparisons of gene groups. GO terms associated with each gene were compared between the five groups: genes previously known to be
associated with deafness in human and mouse (n = 362); novel genes associated with raised ABR thresholds in the current screen (n = 38); genes with normal
thresholds but abnormal waveform features (n = 27); all genes screened in the MGP screen (n = 1,211); and all genes listed in MGI (n = 33,395). The proportion
of genes in each group with the high-level GO terms listed are plotted for the three categories: Cellular component, Molecular function, and Biological process.

 Some of the 38 genes had links to existing pathways involved in deafness. For example,
Duoxa2 is required for maturation and transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the
plasma membrane of Duox2, also known to underlie deafness through its role in hypothyroid-
ism, leading to retarded cochlear development and impaired hearing [18]. Spns2 is a sphingo-
sine-1-phosphate (S1P) transporter, and our discovery of its involvement in deafness supports
the role of the S1P signaling pathway in hearing loss, alongside reports of S1PR2 and Sgms1
mutations causing deafness [19,20,21,22,23]. In contrast, many of the other genes discovered
in this screen, such as A730017C20Rik (Minar2), have no demonstrated role in a biological
process and no a priori reason to predict they might be involved in deafness.
Although some of the 38 new genes identified by this screen showed strong expression in
cochlear hair cells (S4 Table, column Q; https://gear.igs.umaryland.edu), in general expression
levels did not show a strong correlation with our ABR findings.
Progressive hearing loss
As our goal in carrying out the screen was to identify new genes involved in adult-onset hear-
ing loss, we carried out recurrent ABR recordings (usually at 4, 8, and 14 weeks old, plus
shortly after the normal onset of hearing at 2 and 3 weeks old if thresholds were raised at 4
weeks) on some of the mutant lines. Remarkably, several of the mutants we studied showed
relatively normal early development of ABRs followed by progressive increase in thresholds.
These included Srsf7 heterozygotes (encoding a splicing factor; Fig 3A–3C), Gpr152 homozy-
gotes (a G-protein–coupled receptor; Fig 3D–3F), and Klc2 (Fig 4A–4E), plus Spns2 [11],
Wbp2 [10], Acsl4, Zfp719, Ocm, and Klhl18 homozygotes.

at young ages followed by progressive increases in thresholds with age. A-C. Srsf7 heterozygous mutants. A. Four

 The finding of multiple new genes underlying progressive hearing loss and/or impairment
of responses to high frequencies (Figs 1 and 3) is important because progressive hearing loss in
humans is very common and often affects high frequencies first, yet we have few clues to the
pathological molecular processes involved. The mouse alleles studied here are relatively severe
in their effect on protein expression, but variants in the human population may have milder
effects on protein function and lead to later onset of hearing loss. Importantly, the finding of
genes involved in normal development but later deterioration of hearing identifies molecular
pathways likely to underlie adult-onset progressive hearing loss in humans.
Varied pathophysiology underlying deafness
We analysed further a subset of mutant lines and revealed a wide range of pathological condi-
tions underlying hearing impairment. Two examples of contrasting phenotypes are the Klc2
and the Ywhae mutant lines.
Klc2 mutants showed a progressive increase in ABR thresholds with age, mostly affecting
low frequencies (Fig 4A–4F), with a sensorineural (not conductive) pathology. Klc2 encodes
kinesin light chain 2, which, together with kinesin heavy chains (encoded by Kif5), forms the
kinesin-1 motor complex, a microtubule-associated anterograde transporter. The allele design
(Fig 4Ki) allowed us to use the gene encoding β-galactosidase (LacZ) as a reporter system,
showing that Klc2 was expressed in the epithelial cells lining the cochlear duct and strongly in
the spiral ganglion (Fig 4Kii-iii). The middle ear and gross structure of the inner ear appeared
normal. The endocochlear potential (EP) was maintained at a normal level even up to 6
months of age, but the anoxia potential in scala media was significantly less negative in these
mutants, consistent with loss of hair cell conductance (Fig 4I). At one month old, there was
extensive loss of outer hair cell (OHC) hair bundles (Fig 4Gi-vi), DAPI-stained OHC nuclei,
and CtBP2-labelled presynaptic ribbons of OHCs primarily in the region that normally
responds best to 12 kHz (60%–70% of the distance along the cochlear duct from the base), cor-
responding to the worst ABR thresholds (Fig 4Hi-v). There were few signs of inner hair cell
(IHC) degeneration, but the increase in threshold was larger than would be expected if only
OHCs were affected, suggesting IHC dysfunction. Klc2 is involved in anterograde transport of
PI3K, which mediates insertion of AMPA receptors at synaptic membranes [24] and GluR1/
2-containing vesicles to axon terminals [25,26]. We found no abnormality in GluR2-labelled
postsynaptic densities below mutant IHCs (Fig 4Ji-vii), suggesting other transport systems
must move this AMPA receptor to the membrane. Klc2 also interacts with Kcnma1, the cal-
cium-activated potassium channel (BK channel) that underlies the IK,f current required for
very rapid responses of IHCs and contributes to protective efferent suppression of OHCs
[27,28,29,30]. We found that labelling of Kcnma1 in IHCs was less extensive in mutants com-
pared with wild-type controls (at 12kHz; Fig 4Ji-vi), implicating Kcnma1 in the pathological
mechanism; however, knockout of Kcnma1 leads to less severe loss of thresholds [31], so this
alone cannot explain the extent of dysfunction in the Klc2 mutants. Finally, kinesin-1 has been
implicated in maintenance of the hair cell nucleus in its correct position by interacting with
Nesp4 in the outer nuclear membrane [32,33], and Nesp4 mutations lead to location of the
OHC nucleus at the top of the cell and subsequent degeneration [34]. We did not find misloca-
lisation of OHC or IHC nuclei (Fig 4Li-ii), suggesting this was not the mechanism underlying
hearing loss in the Klc2 mutants, and that redundancy between kinesin light chains may com-
pensate for loss of Klc2 in nuclear localisation. No disease-associated loss-of-function muta-
tions of human KLC2 have been reported yet to compare with the Klc2 mutant mice, which
show a complete lack of Klc2 mRNA (Fig 4M). However, a human gain-of-function KLC2
mutation (216-bp deletion upstream of the coding region) leading to increased KLC2

 expression causes spastic paraplegia, optic atrophy and neuropathy (SPOAN), a neurodegener-
ative disorder involving progressive axonal neuropathy [35].
In contrast, the Ywhae mutants showed increased thresholds across all frequencies associ-
ated with variable amounts of accumulated fluid and exudate containing inflammatory cells in
the middle ear, suggesting predisposition to otitis media (Fig 5A–5M). The middle ear mucosa
appeared thickened with granulation tissue in sections (Fig 5L), and scanning electron micros-
copy of the luminal surface showed an open Eustachian tube in mutants, but abundant clusters
of goblet cells (presumed to produce mucus) with fewer ciliated epithelial cells, which would
normally contribute to the clearing of excess mucus (Fig 5M and 5N). The variability in thresh-
olds between individual Ywhae mutants, relatively flat increase across all frequencies, and
near-normal ABR waveform support a conductive hearing loss (Fig 5A–5H). The surface of
the organ of Corti looked normal (Fig 5O and 5P) but we cannot exclude a sensorineural
component in some of the more severely affected mutants, possibly due to the impact of
129S5-derived alleles in the mixed genetic background, or an effect of persistent inflammation
of the middle ear [36]. Ywhae, also known as 14-3-3ε, is a member of the highly conserved 14-
3-3 phosphoserine/threonine binding family, which have many interacting partners and are
thought to provide a scaffold allowing coordination of intracellular signaling [37,38]. Ywhae
is normally widely and strongly expressed throughout the body [39] and within the cochlea
[40], and the mutation led to an absence of detectable Ywhae protein in homozygotes (Fig 5R).
Not surprisingly, Ywhae mutants showed a number of other abnormal phenotypes similar
to those reported in another Ywhae mutant [41] (see S1 Table), including reduced viability
of heterozygotes on a C57BL/6N background (20 heterozygotes out of 192 offspring from
heterozygote × wild-type matings at weaning, chi- squared p < 0.0001) and homozygotes on a
mixed C57BL/6N and 129S5/SvEvBrd/Wtsi background (53 homozygotes at 2 weeks old from
685 offspring from heterozygous intercrosses, chi-squared p < 0.0001). Ywhae homozygotes
also showed reduced growth (Fig 5S) and a shortened skull (Fig 5T–5V). Craniofacial

the cochlear regions, corresponding to the worst thresholds in mutants (12 kHz; Gi. heterozygote n = 4, Gii. homozygote n = 11), while there was little sign of
hair cell loss at higher-frequency regions (42 kHz; Giii. heterozygote, Giv. homozygote). Remaining hair bundles had a normal appearance (Gv. heterozygote,

 malformations may affect Eustachian tube structure and function, leading to otitis media, but
there are many other possible pathological mechanisms not yet explored. Similar fluid-filled
middle ear and conductive hearing loss phenotypes were found in the Mcph1 mutant [12] and
Slc25a21 mutants with reduced Pax9 expression [8].
A third distinct pathology found was a reduction in EP. Normally, a high resting potential
in the cochlear endolymph is generated by the stria vascularis. This is necessary for normal
sensory hair cell function. Progressive disorganisation of the stria vascularis accompanies the
reduced EP in Spns2 mutants [11]. A fourth example is the Wbp2 mutant, in which abnormal
structure of synapses between IHCs and cochlear neurons and swelling of nerve terminals
leads to progressive increase in ABR thresholds [10].
The finding of a wide range of primary pathological processes in these mouse mutants as
outlined above suggests that the pathogenesis of hearing loss in the human population may be
equally heterogeneous. The limited information gleaned from human temporal bone studies
supports the suggestion of heterogeneous pathophysiology underlying progressive hearing loss
[43].
Other features associated with deafness in the new mutants
Many mouse mutants with deafness were originally detected, because they also had a balance
defect leading to circling and/or head bobbing; thus, many of the earliest genes to be identified
were those involved in early developmental problems such as gross inner ear malformations or
sensory hair cell developmental abnormalities affecting both the cochlea and vestibular part of
the inner ear. It is notable that none of the 38 new mutant genes we report here showed any
sign of leading to a balance defect (S1 Table). Nine lines had reduced viability assessed at post-
natal day 14, with three of these lines producing so few homozygotes that heterozygotes were
passed through the phenotyping pipelines instead (Brd2, Srsf7, and Setd5). Six lines had either
male or female infertility (Pex3, Mkrn2, Herc1, Camsap3, Mcph1, Usp42), which is higher than
the expected 5% based on larger panels of mutant alleles. Corneal or lens defects were observed
in five lines (Spns2, Pex3, Agap1, Mcph1, Usp42). Occurrence of anomalous features in other
systems tested were generally scattered across mutant lines and phenotypes, with Duoxa2 and
Ywhae mutants showing the largest number of other abnormalities (S1 Table).

 Mutant lines with normal thresholds but abnormal waveforms
By analysis of click-evoked ABR waveforms, we identified 27 additional mutant lines with nor-
mal hearing sensitivity, but which had abnormal patterns of neural responses, such as smaller
ABR wave amplitudes or prolonged latencies, determined using objective criteria (S1 Table;
Fig 6; S3 Fig; S3 Data). Ten further mutant lines from the 38 with ABR threshold elevation also
exhibited abnormal ABR waveform shapes (S1 Table; S4 Fig; S4 Data). The ABR waveform is a
complex mixture of voltage changes reflecting the sum of excitatory and inhibitory activity at
different times after stimulus onset and different physical locations within the brain relative to
the position of the recording electrodes. Wave 1 reflects auditory nerve activity, and later
waves reflect activity higher up the central auditory pathways. Some mutant lines had reduced
wave 1 amplitudes (Fig 6; S3 and S4 Fig; S4 Data; S1 Table), which may result from desynchro-
nisation of the onset of firing in auditory nerve fibres [44], or reduced numbers of auditory
nerve fibres contributing to the ABR, or a selective loss of high spontaneous rate/low threshold
neurons, which have maximal discharge rate at stimulus onset, or inefficient synaptic recovery
during the short gap (23.5 ms) between stimuli. Other mutants showed abnormal amplitudes
or latencies of later waves, suggesting auditory processing anomalies in the central auditory

waveforms are shown. ABR thresholds are plotted in the left column, click-evoked ABR waveforms recorded at 50-dB
SL in the second column, and IOFs (parameter versus stimulus level above threshold, dB SL) are plotted in the third

 system (Fig 6; S3 and S4 Figs; S3 and S4 Data). These changes could reflect abnormal inherent
excitability of auditory neurons or an alteration in the balance of excitatory and inhibitory
inputs onto these neurons, resulting in increased or decreased discharge or synchrony.
Mutants showing changes in latency are most easily explained by changes in neural conduc-
tion speed, alterations in synaptic delays, or changes in the relative contributions of different
components in this complex neuronal pathway. Finally, in the most extreme example (Bai1,
also known as Adgrb1), the mice exhibited clear auditory-evoked responses and measurable
thresholds, but the ABRs were so abnormal that it was not possible to determine the equivalent
peaks to quantify and compare with control mice (Fig 6). This set of 27 mutants with wave-
form anomalies will be an interesting group to analyse further, because central auditory func-
tion is critical for normal sound perception. Such deficits may translate in humans to altered
performance in sound localisation, ability to follow salient acoustic stimuli in background
noise, discrimination of specific speech features, and other auditory processing disorders (e.g.,
[45]).
Conclusions
We used a rapid ABR protocol to carry out a high-throughput screen of 1,211 new mouse
mutants and revealed a new spectrum of functional deficits in hearing that would not have
been detected using simpler screens, such as the startle response. These include mild-moderate
degrees of hearing impairment, frequency-specific impairments (low or high frequencies), and
a group with abnormal ABR waveforms that likely have deficits in central auditory pathways.
In a subset of the new mutant lines, we have examined other ages to establish the time course
of hearing loss and investigate the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the raised ABR
thresholds. A broad range of pathologies was found, and many mutants showed normal devel-
opment followed by progressive hearing loss. We have shown that some of the genes
highlighted by this study play a role in human hearing, including 2 genes with mutations that
can account for recessive deafness in families and 11 genes that are associated with variation in
auditory thresholds in the UK 1958 British Birth Cohort cross-sectional population. Thus,
mouse mutants can be an effective means to identify candidate genes for human deafness.
This project has provided insights into the wide range of pathological processes involved in
hearing impairment and has revealed a surprising number of unexpected genes involved in
deafness, suggesting extreme genetic heterogeneity. For this reason, it is likely that therapies
will need to be directed at common molecular pathways involved in deafness rather than indi-
vidual genes or mutations. Each new gene identified gives insight into the metabolic pathways
and regulatory processes involved in hearing and thus provides a rich source of targets for
development of therapies for the restoration of hearing.
Materials and methods
Ethics statement
Mouse studies were carried out in accordance with UK Home Office regulations and the UK
Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986 (ASPA) under UK Home Office licences, and the
study was approved by the King’s College London and Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Ethi-
cal Review Committees. Mice were culled using methods approved under these licences to
minimise any possibility of suffering.
For human studies, informed consent was obtained from the adult participants and the
parents or guardians of children prior to participation, and the experiments conformed to the
principles set out in the WMA Declaration of Helsinki and the Department of Health and
Human Services Belmont Report. The US patient provided consent for clinical whole exome

 analysis and written consent for inclusion as a case report. Testing was conducted during the
routine clinical care of a patient in the US; thus, in accordance with US law, this study is
exempt from Institutional Research Board approval.
Generation of mice
Mutant mouse lines were generated using targeted mutations in mouse ES cells [5,6]. The via-
bility of new mutants was determined by genotype distribution at weaning. When possible,
mice homozygous for the targeted mutation were used for screening. If a mutation proved to
be embryonic lethal or had significantly reduced viability at weaning, heterozygous mice were
used instead (356 genes out of 1,211; 29.4%). In most cases, the knockout first conditional-
ready (tm1a) allele for each gene was used, but a subset of the genes were tested using the
derived tm1b allele, which had deletion of a critical exon(s), or other mutations (S2 Table, col-
umn B). The tm1a allele is designed to knock down transcription by introducing a large cas-
sette into the gene, but not all genes were completely inactivated (see S2 Table and column X
in [5], for some examples). Most mutant mice were screened on a C57BL/6 genetic back-
ground. This included some lines on a mixed C57BL/6Brd-Tyrc-Brd; C57BL/6N line and others
on a pure C57BL/6N line (S1 and S2 Tables, column D). Mutant data were compared with a
large set of wild-type data on the same genetic background. When mice were screened on
mixed genetic backgrounds (for example, Ywhaetm1e), age and strain-matched wild-type mice
were used alongside the mutants. Positive control lines known to have a hearing impairment
were compared with their littermate controls on the same, varied genetic backgrounds (S1
Table). At the age screened, 14 weeks, we found no apparent effect of the known Cdh23ahl
allele carried by C57BL/6 mice on ABR thresholds [46], and mutant responses were compared
with mice of the identical genetic background. The Cdh23ahl allele may have interacted with
any of the new mutations to exacerbate their effect, such that the phenotype was easier to
detect at 14 weeks, so this screen could be regarded as a sensitised screen [47].
Phenotyping pipelines
Details of the full phenotyping pipelines in the Mouse Genetics Project (MGP) have been
reported elsewhere [5]. Two assays required mice to be immobilised and so to minimise stress
to the mice, ABR testing was performed under anaesthesia immediately before the DEXA/Fax-
itron assays. Balance was assessed by observation of gait, head bobbing or circling, the rotarod
test, or contact righting test. ABR testing was performed on three phenotyping pipelines used
over successive time periods, termed MGP Pipeline 2, Mouse GP, and MGP Select, respec-
tively. ABRs were recorded in mice aged 13 weeks (±3 days) on MGP Pipeline 2, and at 14
weeks (±3 days) on Mouse GP and MGP Select pipelines. Mice were maintained on a normal
lab chow diet on MGP Pipeline 2 and MGP Select pipelines, but on a high-fat lab chow for the
Mouse GP pipeline.
ABR recordings
ABRs were recorded using the methods described in detail in [4]. Mice were anaesthetised
using intraperitoneal ketamine (100 mg/kg, Ketaset, Fort Dodge Animal Health, KS) and xyla-
zine (10 mg/kg, Rompun, Bayer Animal Health), or a 10% greater dose for the MGP Select
pipeline. Mice were placed on a heating blanket inside a sound-attenuating booth. Subcutane-
ous needle electrodes were inserted in the skin on the vertex (active) and overlying the ventral
region of the left (reference) and right (ground) bullae. Stimuli were presented as free-field
sounds from a loudspeaker whose leading edge was 20 cm in front of the mouse’s interaural
axis. The sound delivery system was calibrated using an ACO Pacific 7017 microphone. For

 threshold determination, custom software and Tucker Davis Technologies hardware were
used to deliver click (0.01-ms duration) and tone pip (6, 18, 24, and 30 kHz of 5-ms duration,
1-ms rise/fall time) stimuli over a range of intensity levels from 0 to 95 dB sound pressure level
(SPL, re. 5 μPa) in 5-dB steps. Averaged responses to 256 stimuli, presented at 42.6/s, were ana-
lysed and thresholds established as the lowest sound intensity giving a visually detectable ABR
response (S1 Fig; S1 Data). Following completion of recording, mice were injected with intra-
peritoneal atipamezole (1 mg/kg, Antisedan, Pfizer) to promote recovery.
A fixed recording protocol was followed:
1. A series of click-evoked ABRs were recorded, ranging from 0 to 85 dB SPL in 5-dB
intervals.
2. Tone-evoked ABRs were recorded for a fixed set of frequencies (6, 12, 18, 24, and 32
kHz) over sound levels ranging from 0 to 85 dB SPL in 5-db intervals. Different SPL ranges
were recorded for different test frequencies to improve the time efficiency of the recording
process (6 kHz, 20 to 85 dB; 12 kHz, 0 to 70 dB; 18 kHz, 0 to 70 dB; 24 kHz, 10 to 70 dB; 30
kHz, 20 to 85 dB). Responses were recorded in an array, beginning with the lowest stimulus
level, in decreasing frequency order before stepping up to the next (5 dB higher) stimulus level.
If mice appeared to have hearing impairment, the upper limit of SPLs was extended to 95 dB
for each test frequency and for clicks (representing the upper limit of the linear range of our
sound system at these frequencies).
For the ABR screen, we aimed to test a minimum of four mutant mice per line (of either
sex). For other tests on the pipeline, 14 mutant mice (7 males and 7 females) were required.
Phenotyping cohorts were issued as mice became available, such that several partial cohorts
were issued, to achieve the required number of 14 mice for each single line. This allowed the
ABR assay to pick up further mice from any lines that exhibited any features of interest to
extend the number tested beyond the target of four. In addition to mutant mice, at least four
wild-type mice from the same matings used to generate the mutants were tested each week
from each core genetic background of the mutants tested. These wild-type results formed a
local control group for comparison with the mutant lines and also contributed to a large refer-
ence range of control data that were used to determine if ABR results from a particular mutant
line were significantly abnormal.
We compared ABR thresholds measured in 1,142 wild-type mice (female, n = 583; male,
n = 559) from the pure C57BL/6N or mixed C57BL/6J and 6N genetic backgrounds. No sex
differences were noted for mice of either genetic background (S2 Fig U-X; S2 Data).
Data analysis
We compared mutant data to a fixed population of control mice of the same genetic back-
ground (Pipeline 2, C57BL/6J and 6N mixed n = 201; Mouse GP, C57BL/6J and 6N mixed
n = 951; MGP Select, pure C57BL/6N n = 742). The reference range for each parameter was
defined as a 95% range of control values, from the 2.5 percentile to the 97.5 percentile of the
control population, shown as a distribution around the median of the control data.
ABR responses were considered in three phases of analysis as follows:
1. ABR threshold and hearing sensitivity. For each stimulus used (click and five tone fre-
quencies), ABRs recorded over the range of sound levels tested were plotted as a stack, ordered
by increasing dB SPL (S1 Fig; S1 Data). Threshold (dB SPL) was estimated by visual inspection
of the stacked ABR traces as the lowest sound level at which any component of the ABR wave-
form was recognisable and consistent with responses recorded at higher sound levels, taking
into account the characteristic lengthening of peak latency as threshold is approached. Thresh-
olds for each stimulus were plotted to give a profile of the hearing sensitivity of each mouse.

 2. Waveform shape comparisons. Through consistent, reproducible electrode placements,
it was possible to compare, qualitatively and quantitatively, the waveform shapes of click-
evoked ABRs. Wave 1 is understood to reflect auditory nerve activity, but as the responses rep-
resent a complex mixture of responses detected at a single point, there is some uncertainty in
ascribing specific brain locations to specific features of the ABR waveform. The free-field bin-
aural stimulation conditions we used complicates interpretation further, because there are bin-
aural interactions even within the cochlear nucleus, e.g., [48]. The ABR represents the
summed electrical vectors detected by the electrodes as synchronised action potential volleys
(particularly from onset-responding neurons) traverse the central auditory pathways. As these
pathways can be both excitatory and inhibitory, as well as both ascending and descending, and
are distributed in a 3D volume, interpretation is complex.
Waveforms recorded to clicks at 20 dB and 50 dB above threshold (sensation level [SL])
were plotted for mutant and control mice, along with an average of the ABR amplitude over
time across mice for each genotype. In these responses, we could identify four waves (positive
to negative deflections; S1 Fig; S1 Data). We first performed a qualitative comparison of click-
evoked waveforms recorded at 50-dB SL (Fig 6; S4 Fig; S4 Data). The averaged mutant wave-
forms were compared with both the averaged control waveform and a 95% reference range of
waveform amplitudes. We also compared individual mutant responses with the reference
range. If both comparisons were in agreement between at least two of three experienced
observers, a quantitative analysis was carried out of the peak amplitude, latencies, and intervals
of these waveforms, by measurement of input-output functions (IOFs).
3. IOFs. Using click-evoked ABRs, waveforms were analysed in detail to determine the
amplitude and latency of positive and negative peaks of the waveform at each stimulus level
recorded (S1 Fig; S1 Data). This was performed using software routines developed by Brad
Buran and kindly donated for our use by M.C. Liberman (Harvard University). We found
wave 1 and wave 3 were highly consistent in control mice. However, whilst wave 2 was clearly
present as a single peak at low sound levels, it often split into two components at higher sound
levels, making analysis complicated, so we did not include it. From these measures, we calcu-
lated the peak-peak amplitude of waves 1, 3, and 4, the amplitude of the N2-P3 component,
and the intervals from P1 to P3 and N1 to N3. IOF curves were plotted relative to click thresh-
old for each mouse (i.e., parameter plotted against dB SL). IOFs of individual mice (mutants
and local controls) were plotted, together with 95% reference range generated for each param-
eter for controls.
Significance calls on mutant data
Wild-type control mice of the same genetic background tested in the same week as mutants
were used as a local control population. As mutant mice were often tested in separate weeks to
obtain the required numbers, the local control population for each mutant line varied in num-
bers. We compared each mutant population of results with a 95% reference range obtained
from a fixed large number of wild-type controls of the same genetic background. Control pop-
ulations for ABR thresholds of C57BL/6N or mixed C57BL/6N and 6J mice were not normally
distributed (Shapiro-Wilk Normality test, p < 0.001). Furthermore, the large disparity in pop-
ulation sizes of the groups invalidates the use of traditional statistical tests giving p-values (e.g.,
t tests or analysis of variance) [42]. Thus, we used the following criteria to define parameters
considered to be abnormal compared with controls.
1. ABR thresholds. A mutant line was considered to have abnormal ABR thresholds if one
of two criteria were met: (1) at least 60% of mutant mice had thresholds for any stimulus out-
side the reference range, or (2) if the mean mutant threshold for any stimulus was at least 20

 dB different from the median of the reference range for that stimulus. Thus, thresholds could
be considered abnormal if they were elevated above controls (lower sensitivity) or reduced
below controls (enhanced sensitivity). We did not find any mutants with enhanced sensitivity.
2. Waveform shape. Click-evoked ABR waveform shapes were compared at 20 dB and 50
dB SL. These comparisons were used as a subjective triage step in the assessment of whether
waveform shapes were normal or perturbed in responses from mutant mice. A dataset was
considered potentially interesting if two experienced observers considered the waveforms to
be perturbed. In these cases, peak amplitudes and latencies were determined and IOFs plotted.
3. IOFs. IOFs were plotted for peak amplitude, latency, and also for wave 1–3 inter-peak
interval as a function of dB SL. Due to the dependency of amplitude and latency on SPL, it is
important to plot IOFs relative to stimulus threshold, so that any changes seen are not a result
of variation in response threshold. Parameters for a mutant line were considered significant if
the mutant mean value was outside of the reference range for at least 40% of the SLs measured
(i.e., for at least 5/12 SLs, when comparing over a 60-dB suprathreshold range).
Quality control.
All mice issued for phenotyping were genotyped [49] at least twice; once
was prior to cohort generation from a clip of pinna skin and a second time was at the end of
the pipeline from postmortem skin tissue. Only when both results matched was the genotype
for an individual mouse ‘locked’ (confirmed), to allow phenotyping results from that mouse to
be included for analyses. ABR results were also subject to a quality control process. Visual
inspection of the ABR traces recorded was used to look for significant noise or artefact on the
recordings, which was accounted for when allocating threshold and other parameters. For
example, excessive myogenic/electrical noise on the recordings can effectively mask an evoked
potential, artefactually elevating the threshold estimate. Thresholds were allocated by experi-
enced operators using the criteria outlined above. Data from random mice were checked by a
second operator.
False positive threshold hits.
Our aim was to report robust effects on hearing that are
likely to be reproducible in other laboratories, so we were cautious about calling the positive
hits. All threshold calls made according to the two criteria detailed above were assessed by two
experienced auditory scientists (one of whom was blinded to the genotype) to identify any
false positive hits. A small number of false positive hits were discounted based on a number of
principles, including excessive variability between individual mice (in some cases due to segre-
gation of an independent new mutation, e.g., [20]) or the presence of a clear outlier (possibly
due to a new mutation) in the mutant population skewing the mean threshold. On these
grounds the number of false positive calls made by criterion 1 (60% rule) was 6 and by crite-
rion 2 (20dB rule) was 12. Of the 1,211 genes tested, this represents a false discovery rate of
0.50% (criterion 1) and 0.99% (criterion 2).
Fisher exact test.
We carried out this additional statistical test for information about
which threshold calls might be significant if the data had been normally distributed (see above
for reasons why this was not our primary test). A two-way contingency table (using the num-
ber of threshold observations that were inside or outside the reference range) was generated
for each mutant group compared with the wild-type control group, and this was used to carry
out a Fisher exact test, giving a p-value indicating the likelihood of the two sets of data belong-
ing to the same population (see [7] for details).
Classification of mouse ABR audiograms
Patterns of raised thresholds for ABRs were classified according to the following criteria:
Severe-Profound, if no responses were detected (up to 95 dB SPL) for at least two adjacent fre-
quency stimuli, for all mice of that genotype; High-Frequency, if thresholds were elevated at

 30 kHz (by >30 dB) and thresholds were not elevated for at least one of the lower-frequency
stimuli; Low-Frequency, if thresholds were elevated for 6 and 12 kHz and were normal for at
least one of the higher-frequency stimuli (with a minimum mean threshold elevation <15 dB);
Moderate, when thresholds were significantly elevated for at least four of the six stimuli tested
(with a minimum mean threshold elevation >15 dB); Mild, when mean thresholds were ele-
vated by 30 dB or less for up to three stimuli tested; Normal Hearing, when no stimuli pro-
duced altered thresholds.
Secondary phenotyping of selected lines
Methods used for histology, immunolabelling and confocal analysis, EP recording, and associ-
ated statistical tests used have been published elsewhere [10,11,12,20,42]. ABR thresholds were
compared using the Mann-Whitney test.
Alleles and genetic backgrounds studied further.
The Srsf7 mutants studied further car-
ried one copy of the mutant Srsf7tm1a(EUCOMM)Wtsi allele, as homozygotes were subviable, on a
C57BL/6N genetic background. Gpr152 mutants were homozygous for the Gpr152tm1b(EUCOMM)Wtsi
allele on a C57BL/6N background. The Klc2 mutant allele was Klc2tm1e(EUCOMM)Wtsi on a C57BL/
6N genetic background that had lost the distal LoxP site downstream of its targeted exon (Fig 4K).
Ywhae mutants studied were homozygous for the Ywhaetm1e(EUCOMM)Wtsi allele, which had also lost
its 30 LoxP site (Fig 5Q), and were analysed on a mixed C57BL/6N and 129S5/SvEvBrd/Wtsi
genetic background because of reduced viability on the original C57BL/6N background.
Auditory function recording.
ABRs were recorded in new cohorts of Srsf7, Gpr152, Klc2,
and Ywhae mutants along with littermate controls at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 14 weeks, and 6 months
old, as indicated in Figs 3, 4 and 5, and waveforms were analysed as described previously [10].
EPs were recorded in Klc2 mutants as described previously [10,11]. The 2f1-f2 distortion prod-
uct otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) was recorded in Klc2 mutants in response to f2 frequencies
ranging from 6,000 to 30,000 Hz in 500-Hz steps, where the f2:f1 frequency ratio was 1.2 and
the f1 and f2 tones were presented at 70 dB SPL and 60 dB SPL, respectively. The 2f1-f2
DPOAE amplitude (dB SPL) was plotted against f2 frequency for control and mutant mice, for
comparison.
Scanning electron microscopy.
Scanning electron microscopy was used to assess the
organ of Corti in Klc2 mutants at 4 weeks old and Ywhae mutants at 8–9 weeks old, along with
their littermate controls, and the middle ear mucosa of Ywhae mutants at 8–9 weeks of age.
Inner ears were isolated (7 Ywhae homozygotes, 5 Ywhae heterozygotes, 2 wild-type litter-
mates; 11 Klc2 homozygotes, 4 Klc2 heterozygotes, 2 wild-type littermates) and fixed in 2.5%
glutaraldehyde and processed using the osmium tetroxide-thiocarbohydrazide (OTOTO)
method as described previously [11]. Middle ear cavities (n = 5 Ywhae homozygotes, 3 hetero-
zygotes, and 3 wild-type littermates) were prepared by opening the bulla; removing the ossi-
cles, muscles, and ligaments; and fixing in glutaraldehyde and osmium tetroxide, as above.
Samples were examined in a Hitachi S-4800 or a JEOL JSM-7610F field emission scanning
electron microscope. For the cochlear samples, images of the surface of the organ of Corti
were taken at 10% intervals along the length of the cochlear duct or locations corresponding to
the best frequency locations of the tones tested in ABR. The frequency areas were determined
according to the mouse tonotopic cochlear map described by Mu
¨ller and colleagues [50].
Immunohistochemistry and imaging.
Inner ears were fixed in 4% PFA for 2 hours and
decalcified in EDTA overnight at room temperature (RT). Following fine dissection, the organ
of Corti was permeabilised in 5% Tween PBS for 40 minutes and incubated in blocking solu-
tion (4.5 mL of 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS and 0.5 mL of normal horse serum) for 2 hours. The
primary antibodies used overnight at RT were mouse anti-GluR2 (1:200, MAB397, Emd

 Millipore), rabbit anti-Kcnma1 (1:100, APC-021, Alomone), rabbit anti-Myo7a (1:200, PTS-
25-6790-C050, Axxora), mouse anti-Ctbp2 (1:400, BD Transduction Laboratories 612044),
and chicken anti-NF-H (1:800, Abcam ab4680). The samples were incubated for 45 minutes at
RT with secondary antibodies at 1:500 dilution: goat anti-mouse IgG2a Alexa Fluor 488
(A21131), goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 546 (A11035), donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594
(Molecular Probes A-21203), and goat anti-chicken Alexa Fluor 488 (Life Technologies
A11039) and later were mounted using ProLong Gold mounting media with DAPI and stored
at 4˚C. Specimens were imaged using a Zeiss Imager 710 confocal microscope interfaced with
ZEN 2010 software. The plan-Apochromat 63× Oil DIC objective was used for all the images
with 2.0 optical zoom, and confocal z-stacks were obtained with a z-step size of 1 μm for inner-
vation imaging, 0.5 μm for the Myo7a imaging, and 0.25 μm for other images. The frequency
areas were determined according to the mouse tonotopic cochlear map described by Mu
¨ller
and colleagues [50].
The number of postsynaptic densities per IHC was quantified by counting manually the
GluR2 puncta in the confocal maximum projection images and dividing it by the number of
IHC nuclei (DAPI labelled). The cell-counter plugin in Fiji (ImageJ) software was used for
counting. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the hair cell confocal stacks was performed
using Fiji software (3D project function). Myo7a was labelled with the secondary antibody
Alexa Fluor 546 and the nuclei with DAPI; however, false colours were used in the 3D
reconstruction.
X-gal staining.
Heads from mice aged 4 weeks were bisected through the midline, the
brain removed, and semicircular canal opened, then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at RT for
90 minutes. After decalcification in EDTA, the samples were washed for 30 minutes at RT with
rotation with the detergent solution (2 mM MgCl2; 0.02% NP-40; 0.01% sodium deoxycholate;
0.01% sodium deoxycholate in PBS, pH 7.3). X-gal (Promega, cat. no. V394A) was added 1:50
to prewarmed staining solution (5 mM K3Fe(CN)6 and 5 mM K4Fe(CN)6 in detergent solu-
tion), and then the samples were stained at 37˚C in the dark overnight. The half-skulls were
then washed twice with saline at 4˚C in rotation for at least 2 hours and stored at 4˚C in 70%
ethanol until tissue processing and embedding. The samples were gradually dehydrated in eth-
anol (Leica TP1020 tissue processor) and embedded in paraffin using xylene as clearing agent
(Leica EG1150H tissue embedder). The samples were cut at 8 μm thick, counterstained with
Nuclear Fast Red (VWR, cat. no. 342094W), and mounted with Eukitt mounting medium
(Sigma-Aldrich). Specimens were imaged using a Zeiss Axioskop microscope connected to an
AxioCam camera and interfaced with Axiovision 3.0 software.
Skeletal measurements.
High-resolution radiographs were collected from 14-week-old
Ywhae homozygotes (n = 6 males, 6 females) with age-, sex-, and strain-matched controls
(n = 5 males, 6 females) using a Faxitron X-ray cabinet (MX-20, Faxitron X-ray, Wheeling, IL)
and assessed using a standard set of parameters, including skull shape, mandible, and teeth
[51].
Middle ear morphology.
External, middle, and inner ear regions were isolated from
Ywhae mutants aged 16 weeks (4 homozygotes, 3 heterozygotes, 4 wild types). Left sides were
examined by dissection for any signs of malformation or inflammation, including excessive
cerumen in the external ear canal; thickening, whitening, sponginess, or vascularisation of the
bulla wall; clarity of the tympanic membrane; presence of fluid or inflammatory debris in the
middle ear cavity; and ossicle malformation. Right ears were fixed for 24–48 hours in formalin,
decalcified in EDTA over 2 weeks, embedded in paraffin wax, and sectioned at 5 μm in a coro-
nal plane. Sections were stained with haemotoxylin and eosin, scanned using a Hamamatsu
NanoZoomer (Hamamatsu City, Japan), and examined. Examiners of middle ears and sections
were blinded to mouse genotype.

 Western blotting.
Brains from 16-week-old mice (2 Ywhae homozygotes, 2 heterozy-
gotes, 4 wild types) were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at −80˚C. Protein extracts
were generated by homogenisation in ice-cold T-PER protein extraction reagent (Pierce,
Rockford, IL) containing a protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Halt, ThermoScientific,
Waltham, MA). Protein (50 μg) from each sample was run in 4%–12% Bis-Tris gels (Life Tech-
nologies, Paisley, UK). A primary rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against a peptide map-
ping within a divergent domain of human YWHAE was used to detect the protein (T-16,
sc1020, Lot: C1914; 1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX; Antibody Registry
AB_630821) [52], PAFAH1b1/LIS1 was detected with recombinant rabbit monoclonal raised
against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues in human LISs1 (ab109630, Lot:
GR55503-8; 1:750, Abcam, Cambridge, UK; Antibody Registry AB_10861275), and a blot with
an additional LIS1/PAFAH1b1 rabbit polyclonal antibody generated against synthetic peptide
corresponding to residues surrounding Gly298 of human LIS1 protein was used for validation
(12453S Lot:1, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). Goat anti-rabbit monoclonal vincu-
lin antibody was used as a loading control (ab129002, 1:10,000, Abcam; Antibody Registry
AB_11144129). A goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP-conjugate was used as a secondary antibody (12–
348, Lot 2584427; Millipore, Billerica, MA; Antibody Registry AB_390191). The blots were
imaged by enhanced chemiluminescence using an ImageLAS 4000 system (GE Healthcare,
Chalfont St. Giles, UK).
Bioinformatic analysis of the 1,211 genes screened
GO term enrichment was analysed using FuncAssociate v3.0 ([53] http://llama.mshri.on.ca/
funcassociate/), based on 22,644 genes (genespace), with 19,064 GO attributes, downloaded on
22 December 2015. FuncAssociate was configured to exclude computationally predicted GO
annotations (Inferred from Electronic Annotation [IEA] evidence code) and run against the
1,211 genes tested by ABR. Revigo was used to reduce the redundancy in GO terms classed as
over- or under-represented (by FuncAssociate) by clustering significant terms into more rep-
resentative subsets ([54] http://revigo.irb.hr/). Only 0.42% GO terms (n = 80) out of 19,064
were overrepresented in our list of 1,211 genes, and 0.09% (n = 18) were under-represented.
The over- and under-represented GO attributes were not significantly clustered into distinct
subsets (visualised as TreeMaps). We also analysed this list of genes with the Reactome path-
way database using Reactome V58 (www.Reactome.org), released October 2016; 10,168
human reactions were organised in 2,069 pathways involving 10,212 proteins and 10,214 com-
plexes. Of the 1,211 genes tested, 564 were not listed in Reactome (46.6%). Of the 38 new genes
underlying increased ABR thresholds, only 12 were included in Reactome. Of the 27 genes
associated with abnormal ABR waveforms, only 17 were included in Reactome. Of 362 deaf-
ness genes already known, 233 were found in the Reactome databases. The 647 (53.4%) genes
represented in the Reactome database out of the initial 1,211 did not produce any overrepre-
sentation of any particular pathways (false discovery rate probability, FDR > 0.839).
Thus, taking the GO term and Reactome analyses together, the 1,211 mouse genes targeted
can be considered to be representative of the entire mouse genome.
GO analysis of genes associated with hearing abnormalities
We used the GOSlim analysis tool on the MGI website (http://www.informatics.jax.org/
gotools/MGI_GO_Slim_Chart.html) to compare the proportions of high-level GO terms asso-
ciated with genes in each of five lists: new genes associated with raised ABR thresholds
(n = 38); previously known genes associated with raised thresholds, human and mouse
(n = 362); new genes associated with ABR waveform abnormalities (n = 27); all genes screened

 by ABR (n = 1,211); and all genes in MGI (n = 33,395). We excluded evidence code IEA. The
proportions of genes labelled with each high-level GO term in each group are plotted in Fig 2.
Variant identification in candidate genes in human deafness
The hearing-impaired child was ascertained through the Kaiser Permanente clinic, testing was
performed at Ambry Genetics, and the mutations were identified in SPNS2 by sequencing of
candidate genes as part of clinical whole exome analysis. Variant pathogenicity prediction was
carried out as previously described [55,56]. The link to the mouse study was established
through GeneMatcher [57].
Human population analysis
The 1958 British Birth Cohort and the collection of hearing data and analysis have been
described previously [58,59,60]. Participants were drawn from 17,638 individuals born in
England, Scotland, and Wales in one week of March 1958. Of the original cohort, 9,377 mem-
bers were revisited by a research nurse for a biomedical follow-up in 2002–2004. Hearing mea-
sures consisted of pure tone audiometry at 1 kHz and 4 kHz at age 44–45 years and were
adjusted for sex, nuisance variables (noise at test, nurse performing test, audiometer used in
test), conductive loss, and hearing loss in childhood. DNA was collected from 6,099 individu-
als and genotyped on various Illumina and Affymetrix SNP chips (for detail, see http://www2.
le.ac.uk/projects/birthcohort/1958bc/available-resources/genetic). These data were then
imputed to the 1,000 Genomes haplotypes (released March 2012) using MACH and Minimac.
Measured SNPs with >95% call rate and Hardy–Weinberg p-value >0.0001 were included as
the input set. In subsequent analysis, imputed SNPs with low imputation quality (r2-hat < 0.3
or MAF < 1%) were omitted. For the association analysis, hearing thresholds at 1 kHz and 4
kHz were log transformed and adjusted for sex, nuisance variables, and conductive hearing
loss in childhood; they were analysed by performing a 1-df ‘per allele’ significance test for asso-
ciation between mean hearing threshold and number of minor alleles (0, 1, or 2) as described
previously [60]. The Bonferroni-corrected p-value for this candidate gene analysis is
p < 6.76 × 10−4, based on testing 37 genes against two threshold frequencies (1 kHz and 4
kHz) at a significance p-value of 0.05, so all p-values listed are significant after correction for
multiple testing. A p-value of p < 6.76 × 10−4 represents the top 0.06% and 0.08% associations
of all approximately 9 million imputed variants for 1 kHz and 4 kHz, respectively.

indicated by thickened black and red lines. In the case of the Duoxa2 mutant, no responses
were measurable up to 95 dB SPL, and this sound level was arbitrarily assigned to be threshold.

from mice on the C57BL/6N genetic background, and represents the 95% reference range used
to assess whether mutant mice have normal or elevated thresholds. H. ABR waveforms are

S1 Table. A summary of features of interest identified from ABR measurements in mutant
mice. On the ‘Gene List’ worksheet, columns (left to right) denote gene symbol, allele tested,
genotypes compared, genetic background strain, and number of mutant mice tested. The heat
map represents click-evoked, 6-kHz, 12-kHz, 18-kHz, 24-kHz, and 30-kHz ABR thresholds,
click-evoked ABR waveform overlay of all mice tested at the same stimulus level above thresh-
old, and IOFs of features of the positive (P) and negative (N) peaks of the ABR waveform,
including P1-N1, N2-P3, P3-N3 amplitude; P1, N1, P3, and N3 latency; and P1-P3 and N1-N3
interval. Blue cells indicate a parameter within the normal range. Red cells indicate abnormal
parameters (as detailed in Methods). For threshold estimates, a red cell containing ‘20dB’ was
called on the basis of the mutant mean deviating by �20dB from the reference range median
value; all other red cells were called on the basis that 60% of observations or more fell outside
the reference range. For click-evoked ABR waveform shapes, a red cell indicates that the obser-
vation of the overlaid waveforms suggested an abnormal response and that this was supported
by subsequent IOF quantification; an orange cell indicates that overlaid waveforms suggested
an abnormal response but this was not supported by input-output analyses. For input-output
analyses, a red cell indicates the parameter was outside the reference range for at least 40% of
the sound levels tested, and the arrow indicates the direction of change. A cell containing a
dash (-) indicates that input-output analysis was not carried out, as waveforms appeared nor-
mal. Grey cells (containing ‘n/a’) indicate that data were not available for analysis; for example,
thresholds were too high to allow waveform overlays or that waveforms were too abnormal to
permit IOF analysis. Genetic background: B6N, C57BL/6N; B6JTyr;B6N, mixed C57BL/6Brd-
Tyrc-Brd and C57BL/6N; C3Fe, C3HeB/FeJ; B6JIco;B10, mixed C57BL/6JIco and C57BL/
10ScSn; AK;BKS, AKR/J 25.0% and C57BLKS/J 75.0%; STOCK, partly undefined background.
Further columns indicate mouse gene symbol, mouse Ensembl ID, human Ensembl ID, and
gene symbol of the human orthologue. Other columns summarise the other phenotyping
information obtained from the Mouse Genetics Project screen at the Wellcome Trust Sanger
Institute. White cells indicate that data are not available; blue cells indicate no significant
abnormalities; red cells indicate that one or more parameters varied significantly from control
values. This heat map can be examined in more detail by clicking on the links on the top row,
which links to other worksheets showing the individual parameters tested in each test area. In
these worksheets, only parameters considered to vary significantly from control values are
shown, plotted as red cells. Where appropriate, the direction of the change of the parameter is
indicated by an up or down arrow. Cells containing ‘M’ or ‘F’ indicate that the change was sig-
nificant for male or female mice only. White cells indicate that either the data were not col-
lected or the results were not significant. On these worksheets, the link in cell E1 (‘Back to
Gene List’) returns the user back to cell A1 of the main Gene List worksheet. ABR, auditory

S2 Table. A summary of ABR results from all mutant lines tested. See S1 Table legend for
details of columns and key to data representation. Additional columns to the right indicate the
significant calls for each stimulus threshold, with red where p-value is greater than the appro-
priate critical value and blue where the p-value is not significant, using a two-way contingency
table and the Fisher exact text. For new mutant lines tested, the Bonferroni-corrected critical
p-value = 4.1 × 10−5, and for positive control lines, the critical p-value = 0.05, as these were
compared with littermate controls due to their unique genetic background. Mutant lines tested
are grouped in rows in the following categories: (1) Mutant mouse lines screened when gene
was previously reported to be associated with hearing impairment. (2) Mutant mouse lines of
known deafness genes where the mouse line did not show raised ABR thresholds. (3) Compar-
ison of mutant lines when more than one allele was screened. For both Rnf10 and Selk, the
tm1a allele responses were normal, but the tm1b allele responses showed an abnormal feature.
For a further two genes, Spns2 and Zfp719, responses from mice carrying the tm1b allele were
marginally more affected than those from mice carrying the tm1a allele. In one unusual case, a
targeted mutation in the Slc25a21 gene only produced affected ABR responses for the tm1a
allele, where the inserted cassette of DNA was found to interrupt expression of the neighbour-
ing Pax9 gene and result in phenotype differences [8]. Once this cassette was removed to pro-
duce the ‘b, ‘c’, and d’ alleles, expression of Pax9 was restored, and the normal ABR
phenotypes were also restored. (4) The main grouping of the table lists a summary of the ABR
results for all the mutant lines tested, listed alphabetically. ABR, auditory brainstem response.

S3 Table. Known deafness genes with normal ABR thresholds in the MGP Screen. This
table lists the genes that were previously known to be involved in deafness either in mouse or
human, but which did not show raised ABR thresholds in the current study. The genotype
reported deaf and the genotype screened are indicated. The right-hand column indicates possi-
ble explanations for the discrepancy in each case. ABR, auditory brainstem response; DFNA,
non-syndromic deafness with dominant inheritance; DFNB, non-syndromic deafness with
recessive inheritance; DFNX, non-syndromic deafness with X-linked inheritance; Hemi, hemi-
zygote; Het, heterozygote; Hom, homozygote; MGP, Mouse Genetics Project; tm, targeted
mutation.

S4 Table. Features of genes identified in this ABR screen. This table summarises informa-
tion from a range of sources to indicate features of interest about the genes detected with ABR
defects in this screen, illustrating the broad range of types of genes found associated with hear-
ing impairment. Columns A–I and K–P were derived from the MGI database, with links given
in column E. For column M, references to phenotype details of alleles reported here are not
included, only reports of other alleles of the same gene. For column P, only selected key GO
terms are listed. Column J was obtained by comparing the human gene location with unidenti-
fied non-syndromic hearing loss loci listed in the Hereditary Hearing Loss Homepage (Van
Camp and Smith; http://hereditaryhearingloss.org/; accessed January 2019). Column Q was
derived from violin plots of single-cell mRNAseq data presented in the gEAR portal (Herzano
and colleagues; https://umgear.org; accessed January 2019). The criteria for inclusion of the
genes were either (1) threshold above 95% confidence interval for at least one stimulus in 60%
of mice of that genotype tested in the MGP screen, (2) �mean threshold for at least one stimu-
lus more than 20 dB above wild-type mean, or (3) †further data obtained after screen
