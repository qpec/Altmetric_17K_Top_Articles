Temporal lobe epilepsy or limbic epilepsy lacks effective therapies due to a void in understanding the 
cellular and molecular mechanisms that set in motion aberrant neuronal network formations during the 
course of limbic epileptogenesis (LE). Here we show in in vivo rodent models of LE that the phospholipid 
mediator platelet-activating factor (PAF) increases in LE and that PAF receptor (PAF-r) ablation 
mitigates its progression. Synthetic PAF-r antagonists, when administered intraperitoneally in LE, re-
establish hippocampal dendritic spine density and prevent formation of dysmorphic dendritic spines. 
Concomitantly, hippocampal interictal spikes, aberrant oscillations, and neuronal hyper-excitability, 
evaluated 15–16 weeks after LE using multi-array silicon probe electrodes implanted in the dorsal 
hippocampus, are reduced in PAF-r antagonist-treated mice. We suggest that over-activation of PAF-r 
signaling induces aberrant neuronal plasticity in LE and leads to chronic dysfunctional neuronal circuitry 
that mediates epilepsy.
A dynamic neuropathological process underlies the development of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy or limbic epi-
leptogenesis (LE)1. Although cellular and molecular inflammatory mechanisms are thought to be involved in 
LE2–7, their significance in promoting homeostasis or exacerbating damage to neuronal network function remains 
incompletely understood.
Dendritic spines (DS) are critical components of the neuronal network. These spines are vulnerable to patho-
logical plasticity after seizures. DS are protrusions, mostly from dendritic membranes, that contain neurotrans-
mitter receptors and postsynaptic molecular signaling systems8, and they receive and integrate excitatory synaptic 
input from pre-synaptic terminals9. DS modulate neuronal excitability and cognitive processes10 and are sus-
ceptible to seizure-mediated damage11, which can in turn lead to abnormal excitability and co-morbidity in epi-
lepsy12. Moreover, increased excitatory synaptic activity induces spine formation, but excessive and unrestrained 
activation can instigate excitotoxicity with DS loss. There is a progressive increase of neuronal hyper-excitability 
in epileptogenesis13,14, and modulation of such hyper-excitability could both protect DS and promote neuronal 
homeostasis after injury.
Platelet-activating factor (PAF, 1-alkyl-2-acetylglycerophosphocholine) is a phospholipid mediator that: a) is 
synthesized rapidly upon brain stimulation and modulates synaptic plasticity15; b) triggers molecular signaling 
related to neurotransmission16 and cellular damage17; and c) induces cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene expres-
sion18, increasing resultant molecular signaling in post-synaptic areas19 after seizures20. The extent to which PAF

rent study addresses.
PAF exerts its bioactivity through a G-protein-coupled receptor (PAF receptor; PAF-r)21 in synaptic sites22. 
PAF-r is actively engaged in neuroinflammatory signaling associated with brain injuries23 such that PAF-r dele-
tion reduces brain damage24–26. The PAF-r antagonist LAU-0901 limits kindling epileptogenesis and induces 
neuroprotection17.
In the current study, we show that: a) PAF increases after status epilepticus (SE); b) ablation of PAF-r limits 
epileptogenesis; and c) bioactivity of PAF-r antagonists reduces seizure susceptibility. Furthermore, our data pro-
vide insight into the mechanism of this reduction in seizure susceptibility, specifically showing that PAF-r antago-
nism protects DS in LE, thus modulating chronic epileptic hippocampal neuronal networks. Our findings suggest 
that PAF-r activation after brain injury is a key contributor to dysfunctional neuronal circuitry in epileptogenesis 
and may contribute to limbic seizures.
Results
PAF increases after status epilepticus, and the PAF receptor mediates neuronal network 
hyper-excitability induced by acute seizures. 
Limbic epileptogenesis starts at the termination of SE 
(post-status epilepticus; PSE) in a rodent model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE)27. Thus, to test the potential sig-
nificance of PAF receptors during LE, we first detected PAF-r expression using in situ hybridization. This revealed 
that PAF-r were localized in the limbic area, preferentially in the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA1 regions of the 
hippocampus (Fig. 1a). Next, to test the hypothesis that PAF increases after SE, we used liquid chromatography 
tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) analysis and found that PAF increased in hippocampi 24 hours after SE 
(naïve: 0.07 vs PSE: 0.15 nM/mg protein; p < 
 0.05; Fig. 1b). Using the pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) test (see Methods), 
we asked if PAF-r mediates seizure susceptibility by comparing seizure severity between male mice deficient in 
PAF-r (PAF-r−/−)28 and their age-matched wild type mice (PAF-r+/+) following PTZ administration at the con-
vulsive dose (75 mg/kg). We observed that PAF-r−/− is resistant to induced acute tonic-clonic seizures (Fig. 1c, 
Racine score: PAF-r−/− 1.0 ± 
 00 vs. PAF-r+/+ 2.3 ± 
 1.4, p = 
 0.02), requiring 2.4 times more PTZ (185 mg/kg) to 
induce seizures (Supplementary Fig. 1). Then, using a rapid kindling model of LE13, we compared progression 
of seizures in adult male mice deficient in PAF-r (PAF-r−/−)28 and their age-matched wild type mice (PAF-r+/+), 
uncovering a remarkable attenuation of seizure severity at day 4 (Fig. 1d Racine score: PAF-r−/− 2.81 ± 
 0.42 vs. 
PAF-r+/+ 4.74 ± 
 0.12, p = 
 0.0034). Additionally, seizure susceptibility was limited in PAF-r−/− mice one week after 
kindling (rekindling, RK) (Fig. 1d, Racine score: PAF-r−/− 2.8 ± 0.5 vs. PAF-r+/+ 4.71 ± 0.28, p = 0.011).
We showed previously that the PAF-r antagonist LAU-0901 reduces progression of seizure severity and seizure 
susceptibility in models of temporal lobe epilepsy17. Here, we studied the bioactivity of a newly formulated PAF-r 
antagonist, LAU-09021, against seizures using the PTZ test on a screened series of PAF-r antagonist compounds 
(Supplementary Fig. 2a,b). LAU-09021 has a sulfur molecule as a heteroatom (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 2b). 
 
We observed that LAU-09021 reduced partial limbic and generalized seizures compared to the vehicle, and was 
more efficient than LAU-0901 at reducing seizures (Fig. 1g). Moreover, LAU-09021-treated mice displayed an 
increased survival rate after receiving a convulsive dose of PTZ, as compared to vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 1e).
PAF-r antagonism restores DS integrity and reduces seizure susceptibility in epileptogen-
esis. 
Spines are damaged after repeated seizures and in epilepsy27. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the 
administration of PAF-r antagonists during LE provides protection for DS. LAU-0901 preserves DS density in the 
stratum oriens (OR) (LAU-0901: 0.8 ± 
 0.02 vs. vehicle (VEH): 0.65 ± 
 0.02; p = 
 0.0001; LAU-09021: 0.65 ± 
 0.02) 
and the DG (LAU-0901: 0.8 ± 
 0.03 vs. VEH: 0.7 ± 
 0.02; p = 
 0.02, LAU-09021: 0.60 ± 
 0.03 Fig. 2a–c). As com-
pared to LAU-09021-treated mice, LAU-0901-treated mice showed an increase in DS length in the OR (LAU-
0901: 1.5 ± 
 0.04 vs. LAU-09021: 1.33 ± 0.04; p = 
 0.0003) and stratum lacunosum-moleculare (L-M) (LAU-0901: 
1.6 ± 
 0.04 vs. LAU-09021: 1.4 ± 
 0.04; p = 
 0.01; Fig. 2b,d). In the DG, neither LAU-0901 nor LAU-09021-treated 
mice differed from vehicle-treated mice, whereas in the OR, LAU-09021-treated mice showed shorter dendritic 
spines, as compared to vehicle-treated mice (LAU-09021: 1.3 ± 
 0.03 vs. VEH: 1.5 ± 
 0.08; p = 
 0.004). Alternatively, 
in the LM, PAF-r antagonism decreased DS length (LAU-0901: 1.6 ± 
 0.04 vs. VEH: 1.7 ± 
 0.04; p = 
 0.03; LAU-
09021: 1.4 ± 0.04 vs VEH, p < 0.0001 Fig. 2b,d).
To analyze the effect of PAF-r antagonism on overall spine integrity, a correlation analysis was performed 
between the spine density and spine length of PAF-r antagonist-treated animals (Fig. 3). Dendritic spine density 
correlated positively with DS length in the OR, L-M and DG in LAU-0901-treated mice and vehicle-treated mice, 
such that lower spine density was associated with shorter spine length. This linearly-positive relation is justified 
by the fact that the slope of each regression line in the top and middle panels of Fig. 3 is significantly greater than 
0 (every corresponding p value is < 
0.05). Note that the Pearson Correlation Coefficients (VEH: OR r = 
 0.380 
LM r = 
 0.386 DG r = 
 0.346 and LAU-0901: OR r = 
 0.291 LM r = 
 0.296 DG r = 
 0.399) indicate moderate corre-
lations, by the rule of thumb, in large data sets. Conversely, DS density correlated negatively with DS length in 
LAU-09021-treated mice, such that higher densities were associated with shorter spine lengths, with the slopes 
of regression lines in the LM and DG being significantly less than zero (p < 
 0.05) but not significant in the OR 
(p = 
 0.117; Correlation Coefficients, OR r = 
 − 
0.204 LM r = 
 − 
0.366 DG r = 
 − 
0.291). In addition, we observed 
that dysmorphic filopodia-like formations from dendrites in vehicle-treated mice were prevented by LAU-0901 
and LAU-09021 treatment (VEH: 4.36 ± 
 0.5; LAU-0901: 0.92 ± 
 0.2; LAU-09021: 1.46 ± 
 0.4; p < 
 0.0001 and 0.0002 
respectively with VEH) (Figs 4a–c and 5).
LAU-09021 lessens seizure onset and hyper-excitability. 
Limbic epilepsy is commonly characterized 
by a high frequency-hyper-excitable limbic neuronal network30. Also, hippocampal hyper-excitability and sei-
zures contribute to the progression of the epileptic condition13,31–33. Our model of TLE reproduces chronic limbic

recurrent spontaneous seizures34. We tested our hypothesis that LAU-09021 counteracts the chronic hippocampal 
hyper-excitable state as a consequence of PAF in LE. We characterized hyper-excitable neuronal networks in the 
hippocampus 15–16 weeks after SE using multi-array microelectrodes inserted into the dorsal hippocampi of 
freely-moving mice (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. 3). LAU-09021, administered during five consecutive days 
after SE (epileptogenesis), limited high amplitude spontaneous epileptiform spikes, mainly in the stratum radia-
tum (RAD) 105 days after SE (Fig. 6b).
At 105 days post-SE, animals were euthanized for spine density (Fig. 6c–e) and length (Supplementary Fig. 4) 
 
measurements. At this time point, vehicle-treated animals continue to evidence a decrease in dentate gyrus spine 
density as compared to healthy controls. This loss in spine density appears to be attenuated in LAU-treated ani-
mals. These changes, at the major input region of the hippocampus, may aid in explaining the reduction in epilep-
tiform spikes observed at this time point (additionally, LAU-09021 appears to modestly increase spine density in 
the stratum lacunosum moleculaire; no effects at 105 days were observed in the stratum oriens).
Treatment with LAU-09021 during epileptogenesis reduced the spontaneous power of delta and theta waves 
in the OR, pyramidal (PYR), and stratum radiatum (RAD) layers; reduced power of beta waves in the OR, 
increased the power of beta and gamma waves in the DG (Fig. 7a); and reduced high frequency oscillations 
(HFOs; LAU-09021: 0.5 × 
 10−7 ; VEH: 0.26 × 
 10−6; p < 
 0.0001) in the DG (Fig. 7b) of the dorsal hippocampus 
110 days after SE. Also, hippocampal spontaneous epileptiform spikes were reduced in LAU-09021-treated mice 
(LAU-09021: 1.8 ± 
 0.5; VEH: 5.3 ± 
 0.3, p:0.01) (Fig. 7c). Since neuronal hyper-excitability is a component of the 
altered neuronal network in epilepsy, we evaluated the degree of induced hyper-excitability following the PTZ test 
at sub-convulsive doses (Fig. 6d–f, Supplementary Fig. 3). LAU-09021-treated mice displayed a trend of higher 
latency for seizures compared to vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 6e) and showed reduced seizure severity (Racine’s

Discussion
PAF accumulation in the brain after seizures16,24 or SE (Fig. 1) could sustain glutamate release35 and activation of 
COX-2 gene expression36, inducing production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)37. PGE2 regulates neuronal mem-
brane excitability38, which synergistically boosts intraneuronal calcium mobilization mediated by PAF39 and 
facilitates a hyper-excitable state in the neuronal network during epileptogenesis. Therefore, anti-epileptogenesis 
mechanisms could be mediated by PAF-r antagonism, indicating a novel alternative therapeutic approach to 
modulating the COX-2 signaling cascade40.
Control of the input and output of the hippocampal network41 takes place during the functional activation of 
DS and somatic inhibition42,43. Also, DS formation is widely assumed to reflect structural reorganization of synap-
tic connections44. Dendritic spines, sites for excitatory synaptic transmission, play a major role in neuronal plas-
ticity in epilepsy. Models of TLE show DS loss11,29 and increased dendritic length in pyramidal cells45, suggesting 
a cellular mechanism of recovery for increasing synaptic contacts. This is important in maintaining homeostatic 
synaptic function or formation of abnormal structural reorganization that promotes circuitry reorganization and 
epileptogenesis. Reduced spine density is associated with reduction of spine length and has been observed in 
other disorders46,47. Here, we observed a positive correlation between DS density and length in vehicle and LAU-
0901-treated mice, suggesting plasticity as a consequence of SE (Fig. 3). Since LAU-0901-treated animals display 
greater spine density than vehicle-treated mice (in the OR and DG), LAU-0901 could promote faster recovery 
of dendritic spines in those hippocampal regions critical for hippocampal connectivity with other brain circuits. 
Interestingly, a negative correlation between DS density and length was observed in LAU-09021-treated mice. 
We hypothesize that this scenario reflects use of an alternative homeostatic plasticity mechanism, potentially 
reflecting different timescales of recovery associated with different pharmacokinetics of the two LAU compounds, 
a topic for further research.
PAF-r antagonism may elicit protection of neuronal circuitry48 in epileptogenesis by increasing post-synaptic 
contacts in the DG (Fig. 6e). This could improve input from the entorhinal cortex, which may be the origin of the 
observed increase in DG neuronal network activity (Figs 6b and 7a) and retraction of post-synaptic contact in 
the stratum lacunosum-moleculare. Such an effect would limit CA3 input from Schaffer collaterals, as reflected 
by depressing neuronal network activity in the stratum radiatum (Fig. 7a). As a result of this restructuring of 
the hippocampal circuitry, PAF-r antagonism attenuates onset and propagation of epileptiform activity in the 
CA1 hippocampal activity (Figs 6b and 7a). On the other hand, LAU-09021 initially facilitates spine recovery, 
increasing the length rather than the number of spines at 5 days PSE. At 105 days PSE, however, variance in spine 
length appears diminished, whereas small but significant changes in spine density are still observed. Although a 
percentage of the observed differences are small in absolute terms, there may be synergistic effects that represent a 
cumulative benefit. Furthermore, while the biological significance of dendritic spine density and morphometry is 
well established, it is likely that these parameters vary over a small range such that epileptogenesis cannot instigate 
total DS loss, inherently limiting the signal window for PAF-r antagonist rescue. However, based on the current 
observations, we hypothesize that during epileptogenesis there is a dynamic restructuring of dendritic spines that 
could involve different waves of cellular mechanisms for mediating growth of dendritic spines (LAU-09021) as 
well as spinogenesis (LAU-0901). If epileptogenesis is interrupted by treatment, the long term cellular strategy 
of homeostatic plasticity may shift to spinogenesis (as compared to spine growth), as we observed at 105 days 
post-status epilepticus. Further studies at different time points in epileptogenesis will be required to determine if 
PAF-r antagonism mediates such dynamic changes in dendritic spines.
Unexpectedly, we observed aberrant filopodia-like spines in vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 4a); these spines were 
prevented by PAF-r antagonism in the LAU-09021- and LAU-0901-treated mice. At present there are no scientific 
reports showing that such aberrant dendritic spines occur in epileptogenesis; however, spine alterations are pres-
ent in developmental and mental disorders49,50. The structural variation in spines observed in our studies could 
contribute to the aberrant formation of circuitry and co-morbidities of epilepsy, in addition to disruptive behavior 
and cognitive deficits. Moreover, prevention of the formation of these aberrant spines by PAF-r antagonism could 
be involved in reduction of seizure susceptibility and hippocampal hyperexcitability17 (Figs 6 and 7). These results 
provide anatomical and electrophysiological evidence that aberrant dendritic spine formation in epileptogenesis 
could have an impact on late excitability of neuronal circuitry.
Spontaneous epileptiform events51–57 are associated with brain hyper-excitability58,59 and reflect aberrant neu-
ronal projections present in TLE32. Delta-band activity (0–4 Hz) is characterized by slow waves during slow-wave 
sleep and drowsy brain states. The elevation of slow-wave activity, especially delta-band activity, is correlated 
with behavioral changes in simple-partial and complex-partial seizures60,61. Large amplitude (1–2 Hz) slow activ-
ity can also occur in the frontal and parietal neocortices during (ictal) and immediately following (postictal) 
temporal lobe seizures61. Power spectral densities for delta and theta waves were significantly lower in LAU-
09021-treated mice three months after SE. This may signify that formation of an aberrant neuronal network in 
epileptogenesis is limited by PAF-r antagonism and, as a consequence, decreases the establishment of epileptic 
neuronal circuitry.
High-frequency oscillations at > 
100 Hz have been recorded in cortical structures of humans and other ani-
mals, both under physiological conditions and during partial epilepsies62. Intracranial electroencephalography 
recordings obtained from pharmaco-resistant patients suffering from TLE have shown that HFOs are observed 
in tandem with an interictal spike63,64. LAU-09021 significantly reduced HFOs mainly in the DG, suggesting that 
LAU-09021-treated animals experience attenuation of hippocampal recurrent neuronal circuitry65.
Furthermore, beta and gamma waves are depressed after seizures66. We observed that LAU-09021 intervention 
(five days PSE) reduced spontaneous epileptiform activity. Beta and gamma oscillations in the hippocampal CA3 
area are modulated by aberrant GABA-mediated neurotransmission from the DG66. LAU-09021-treated mice 
had an increase in beta and gamma oscillations in the DG compared to vehicle-treated animals. The possibility

that LAU-09021 could facilitate GABAergic transmission from the DG to the CA367 after seizures in vivo should 
be explored more in depth.
Conclusion
We conclude that an increase in PAF activates PAF-r in the hippocampus during epileptogenesis, thus medi-
ating neuronal network hyper-excitability and seizure susceptibility. By blocking PAF-r and using the PAF-r 
antagonist during epileptogenesis, aberrant connectivity in the hippocampus was limited and, as a conse-
quence, onset of epilepsy was reduced. We speculate that PAF-r activity could mediate aberrant connectivity in 
epileptogenesis.
Taken together, our observations suggest that the neuronal circuitry in the epileptic brain41 is enhanced by 
PAF-r over-activity during epileptogenesis. More experimental studies need to be conducted to elucidate the 
molecular and neurotransmission-related mechanisms involved in this process. Furthermore, understanding 
PAF antagonism and the potential therapeutic usefulness of PAF receptor antagonists is relevant to developing 
disease-modifying therapeutic interventions for patients at risk for epilepsy.
Methods
Animals. 
Studies were performed according to National Institutes of Health guidelines and in accordance with 
nationally accepted principles in the care and use of experimental animals. The Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee (IACUC) at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (LSUHSC), New Orleans, approved 
the animal protocols used for this study. Water and food were available for ad libitum consumption. All efforts 
were made to minimize pain and suffering and to reduce the number of mice used in these experiments. For 
euthanasia, animals were deeply anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride and xylazine (200 mg/kg + 
 10 mg/kg; 
 
i.p.) prior to death by decapitation.
A total of 122 C57BL/6 adult male mice (20–25 g; Charles River Labs, Wilmington, MA) and 12 adult male 
PAF-r (−/−) and 5 wild type were used in this study. For PAF-r−/−: Donor strain: 129P2/OlaHsd via E14.1 ES cell 
line, genotype a/aB/BC/C. The mice were developed by Dr. Satoshi Ishii (University of Tokyo, 1998). A neomy-
cin cassette was inserted into the open reading frame of the Ptafr gene. The mutant mice were backcrossed to 
C57BL/6. Colony maintenance was conducted at the LSUHSC-Neuroscience Center of Excellence and back-
crossed to C57BL/6 (Heterozygote x C57BL/6NCrlCrlj). PAF-r−/− mice were bred in-house in our animal facility. 
For this study, mice were anesthetized, tailed and genotyped as described below. Briefly, genomic DNA prepara-
tion was performed by digesting 5 mm tail tips in a mixture of proteinase K and DirectPCR (Tail) reagent (Viagen, 
Los Angeles, CA) following the manufacturer’s directions. The lysates were spun down and 2 μ 
l of each genomic 
preparation were used for PCR analysis. PCR were carried out using illustra PuReTaq Ready-To-Go PCR beads 
(GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) with the following conditions: 94 °C 180 s (1 cycle); 94 °C 30 s, 56 °C 30 s, 
72 °C 60 s (30 cycles) and, 72 °C 300 s (1 cycle). Primers used for the analysis were as follows: mPAFR Forward 
 
5′ 
-CTCCCACTGTGGATTGTCTACTACT-3′ 
; mPAFR Reverse 5′ 
-AAGATAAGGAAGAAGACGAGGAAGA-3′ 
; 
Neo CASSETTE 5′ 
-CTATCAGGACATAGCGTTGGCTAC-3′ 
. The combination of the primers used to detect 
wild-type allele were mPAFR Forward and Reverse, and for the PAF-r−/− allele was mPAFR Forward and Neo 
CASSETTE. PCR for both alleles was run in separate reactions retrieving a band of approximately 400 bp for WT 
and 1000 bp for Mutant revealed in a 1% agarose gel stained with Ethidium Bromide.
Pentylenetetrazol test. 
Systemic administration of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), a model used to test potential 
anti-convulsive effects27, was used as an initial step to further evaluate the spectrum of activity of PAF-r antago-
nist compounds. Based on our preliminary experiments, we observed that: a) intraperitoneal (i.p.) administra-
tion of PTZ at 35 mg/kg is useful as a sub-convulsive dose to evaluate non-convulsive seizures, and b) the PAF-r 
antagonist LAU-0901 has a physiological effect on the brain for 4–6 hours after injection and has no apparent 
adverse effects17,68. Animals were placed in individual Plexiglass cages (28 × 
 28 × 
 37.5 cm) and given a single dose 
of PTZ (Sigma, St Louis, MO) at 35 mg/kg/i.p. or 70 mg/kg/i.p. to evaluate effectiveness of the PAF-r antagonist 
compounds against seizures or to determine chronic hippocampal hyper-excitability and seizure susceptibility 
as a consequence of LE. Animal recordings (90-minutes in length) were made using a video-recording system 
(Handycam Sony); recordings began immediately after PTZ injection. At the end of the experiment, animals were 
euthanized. Locomotor seizures were quantified according to a modified Racine’s Score69, as follows: 0, normal 
behavior—walking, exploring, sniffing, grooming; 1, immobile, staring, jumpy, curled-up posture; 2, automa-
tisms—repetitive blinking, chewing, head bobbing, vibrissae twitching, scratching, face washing, “star gazing”; 
3, partial-body clonus, occasional myoclonic jerks, shivering; 4, whole-body clonus, “corkscrew” turning and 
flipping, loss of posture, rearing, falling; 5, non-intermittent seizure activity; and 6, wild running, bouncing, 
tonic-clonic seizures.
Post-status epilepticus model of epileptogenesis. 
Status epilepticus was induced by a single dose 
of pilocarpine hydrochloride (250 mg/kg) (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) administered i.p. 30 minutes after 
methyl scopolamine nitrate (1 mg/kg; i.p., Sigma Aldrich). Animals were placed in individual Plexiglass cages 
and monitored by laboratory personnel during and after SE. Seizures were rated according Racine’s score. 
Non-intermittent seizure activity, stages 3 and/or 4, for each mouse was limited to 90 minutes using a single dose 
of diazepam (10 mg/kg, i.p., Sigma Aldrich). Each animal was monitored by trained laboratory personnel in a 
temperature-controlled surgical room until full locomotor recovery was observed (2–4 hours). Surviving animals 
(60%) were randomized by number assignment and placed in individual cages in an animal room with an artifi-
cial 12-hour light/dark cycle with access to food and water ad libitum.

PAF-r antagonist administration. 
The anti-seizure activity of novel PAF-r antagonists (LAU-0901, LAU-
09015, LAU-09017, LAU-09019, LAU-09018, LAU-09019, LAU-09020, LAU-09021, LAU-09023 and LAU-09025 
(60 mg/kg/i.p.) in sterile Baxter 0.9% sodium chloride) was assessed by administration two hours prior to PTZ 
testing. Antagonist activity was compared to vehicle alone. In a second set of experiments, either 1 mL of vehicle 
or PAF-r antagonists (LAU-0901 or LAU-09021 60 mg/kg/i.p.) were administered at the same dosage daily for 
 
5 days beginning 24 hours post-SE termination.
Local field potential recordings and analysis. 
For local field potential (LFP) analysis, a silicon probe 
with 16 electrodes (spacing 100 μ 
m, NeuroNexus, Ann Arbor, MI) was implanted in the right dorsal hippocam-
pus of each mouse (from Bregma: 1.80 mm posterior; 1–1.5 mm lateral and 2.70 mm depth) 98 days after SE 
under anesthesia induced by a mixture of ketamine (200 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) (Vedco Inc., Saint 
Joseph, MO) using a surgical microscope and sterilized neurosurgical instruments. Briefly, during surgery the 
probe was placed on superficial layers of the cortex and then moved inward slowly with the aid of stereotaxic 
equipment (Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA). The resulting hole was covered by Surgicel (Ethicon Inc., San 
Angelo, TX) and saturated with a sterile cerebral spinal fluid (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). A stainless 
steel screw (Plastic One, Roanoke, VA) was implanted in the occipital bone as a ground wire for the silicon 
probe. Plastic One gel (Plastic One) was used to attach the probe and screw it to the skull. After recovery from 
anesthesia, mice were placed for recordings in individual Plexiglass cages and allowed to explore freely; food and 
water were provided ad libitum. LFP from the hippocampi were recorded from the headstage connected with the 
probe, amplified (1000× 
), band-pass filtered (0.1–300 Hz), and digitized at 1 KHz using MAP system data acqui-
sition 7 days after surgery. Briefly, continuous LFP activity (4–5 minutes) from each freely-moving mouse was 
recorded and sampled (10–12 samples/hour) every 5 minutes from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. using a MAP (Plexon) 
and video-recorder system for 5 consecutive days. LFPs were analyzed using NeuroExplorer (Next Tech Solutions, 
Inc., Austin, TX). Delta epochs (3–6 seconds each) from each LFP were determined by calculating the ratio of 
delta and theta frequency bands in the hippocampal CA1 region70, without artifacts or noise, by an investigator 
blinded to the treatment and confirmed during a period of immobility by visual inspection of video-LFP record-
ings. Band frequencies for delta (0.1–3.9 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), beta (13–20 Hz), low gamma (21–40 Hz), and bands 
from 200–300 Hz were selected from the LFPs using power spectral density (PSD) analysis (NeuroExplorer, Next 
Technologies, Madison, AL)14. Then, average values of PSD of each band were compared from samples (n = 
 42 
each group) of the PAF-r antagonist LAU-09021- and vehicle-treated animals. For automatic assessment of high 
frequency spikes the signal was filtered at 250–300 Hz band and analyzed using the offline sorter threshold func-
tion. Successive spike amplitude activity above the baseline was quantified using NeuroExplorer combined with 
offline sorter software. Artifacts such as head movement or grooming were excluded by visual inspection of 
video-LFP recordings. At the end of the experiment, verification of the probe placement in the dorsal hippocam-
pus was confirmed by histology13 for anatomic-physiological correlation of hippocampal layers.
Rapid kindling model of epileptogenesis. 
Bipolar electrode units (Plastic One Inc., Roanoke, VA, 
U.S.A.) were implanted in the dorsal right hippocampus (coordinates: 2.3 mm caudal to bregma; 1.75 mm lateral 
to midline; 2.00 mm ventral to dura) and ground wire was placed on the occipital bone, guided by stereotaxic 
procedure under anesthesia induced by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine hydrochloride: xylazine 
(200 mg/kg: 10 mg/kg; Vedco). One week after surgery, kindling was achieved by sub-convulsive electrical stimu-
lation at 30-min intervals (six stimulations per 10-s train containing 50-Hz biphasic pulses of 100-lA amplitude. 
To test the seizure susceptibility responses, sub-convulsive electrical stimulations (as during kindling) were given 
1 week after kindling (rekindling).
In situ hybridization. 
Mice were deeply anesthetized and brains were dissected according to previous pro-
cedures17, and a 385 bp fragment from the coding region of the PAF-r mRNA was amplified from mouse brain 
cDNA (Clonotec) by PCR and inserted into pCRrII TOPO (Invitrogen). 35S-labeled riboprobes were transcribed 
in sense and antisense directions.
Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. 
PAF concentration in hippocampal samples 
was calculated as follows: brain enzymes were inactivated using high-powered microwave irradiation (10 KW, 
400 V, 750 ms) focused on the head after anesthesia induced by isofluorane, followed by rapid immersion of 
the mouse head in ice water. Protein precipitates were separated by centrifugation, and solvent extracts were 
pre-equilibrated at pH 3.0 in 10% methanol/water, loaded to 500 mg C18 columns (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, 
U.S.A.), and then eluted with 1% methanol/ethyl acetate. Eluates were concentrated on an N2 stream evaporator. 
Samples were loaded to a liquid chromatograph-tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS-MS; LC-TSQ Quantum, 
Thermo-Finnigan, Waltham, MA, U.S.A.) installed with a Biobasic-AX column (Thermo-Hypersil- Keystone, 
Bellefonte, PA, U.S.A.) (100 · 2.1 mm, 5-lm particle sizes). Samples were eluted in a linear gradient [100% solu-
tion A (40:60:0.01 methanol/water/acetic acid pH 4.5) to 100% solution B (99.99:0.01 methanol/acetic acid)] at 
a flow rate of 300 ll/min for 30 min. LC effluents were diverted to an electrospray-ionization probe (ESI) on a 
TSQ Quantum (Thermo-Finnigan) triple quadrupole mass spectrometer13; lipid standards (Cayman Chem., 
Ann Arbor, MI, U.S.A.) were used for tuning, optimization, and calibration curves. The instruments were set on 
full-scale mode to detect parent ions and also were set to selected-reaction mode (SRM) for quantitative analysis 
to detect product ions simultaneously. The selected parent/product ions (m/z) and collision energy (v) obtained 
on negative ion detection mode were 370.0/171.3/2 for PAF17.
Dendrite spine detection and analysis. 
Brains were processed following established procedures accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s instructions (FD Rapid GolgiStain Kit, FD Neurotechnologies, Inc., Columbia, MD). 
Coronal sections (40 μ 
m) were made and then mounted, air-dried, dehydrated in alcohol, cleared in xylene and

cover-slipped. Coronal sections were scanned using brightfield microscopy and magnified at 100X. In addition, 
individual areas were photographed at 40× 
 and then apical and basal dendrites from Golgi-impregnated neu-
rons were selected from treated mice using imaging application software (OlyVIA, Olympus, Center Valley, PA). 
Z-stacks (step size = 
 0.3 μ 
m) of dendrites from the stratum oriens (OR), lacunosum-moleculare layers (L-M) of 
the CA1 and outer molecular layer (OM) from the dentate gyrus (DG) were captured using a 100× 
/oil objective. 
Images were recorded using an Axioplan 2 microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY) coupled with AxioCam 
and Axiovision software (Carl Zeiss Inc.). Dendrite density and length of dendritic spines were quantified with 
Image J (National Institute of Health). A minimum of 10 dendrites were calculated per animal for the following 
regions: OR, L-M and DG. We then calculated the number of dendritic spines per segment of individual dendrites 
per hippocampal subfield for each treated group of animals.
Statistics. 
The data retrieved from each experiment were averaged and expressed as mean ± 
 S.E.M. For sta-
tistical significance, one time point (or more than two observations) was analyzed using Student’s t-Test and 
ANOVA followed by post-hoc tests (Tukey-Kramer and Hsu’MCB). Correlation analysis was performed for spine 
density (number of spines per 10 μ 
m of dendrite segment cell and dendritic spine length) using Pearson’s correla-
tion analysis. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. All data analyses, including sample size were conducted 
using JMP 8.0 statistical software from SAS (Cary, NC).
