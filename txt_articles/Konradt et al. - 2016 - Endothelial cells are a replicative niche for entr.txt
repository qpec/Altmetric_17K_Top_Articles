Abstract
An important function of the blood–brain barrier is to exclude pathogens from the central nervous 
system, but some microorganisms benefit from the ability to enter this site. It has been proposed 
that Toxoplasma gondii can cross biological barriers as a motile extracellular form that uses 
transcellular or paracellular migration, or by infecting a host cell that then crosses the blood–brain 
barrier. Unexpectedly, analysis of acutely infected mice revealed significant numbers of free 
parasites in the blood and the presence of infected endothelial cells in the brain vasculature. The 
use of diverse transgenic parasites combined with reporter mice and intravital imaging 
demonstrated that replication in and lysis of endothelial cells precedes invasion of the central 
nervous system, and highlight a novel mechanism for parasite entry to the central nervous system.
Reactivation of latent Toxoplasma gondii infection in the brain causes significant disease in 
immune deficient individuals1. Several major mechanisms have been proposed to explain 
how pathogens, including T. gondii, access the brain2–6. In one scenario, the ability of

 microorganisms in the blood to perform para- or transcellular migration7–10 may allow them 
to cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB). Alternatively, the ‘Trojan horse’ hypothesis suggests 
that the ability of infected cells to disseminate from sites of infection can promote pathogen 
spread into the brain3,6,11–13. Toxoplasmosis in mice provides a natural model system to 
study host–pathogen interactions, and advances in live imaging have provided new insights 
into the immune response to T. gondii14. Indeed, multi-photon (MP) microscopy using Tie2-
GFP mice to visualize endothelial cells (ECs) and fluorescent parasites has been combined 
with a variety of transgenic parasite strains and transfer systems to characterize host–
pathogen interactions in the meningeal and parenchymal compartments of the 
neocortex15–17.
Results
T. gondii infection of the vascular compartment
To study T. gondii in the vascular compartment, Tie2-GFP reporter mice were infected 
intraperitoneally (i.p.) with tachyzoites (Fig. 1a,b,e) or orally with cysts (Fig. 1c,d,f–g) using 
a T. gondii strain expressing the tdTomato fluorescent protein (Pru-tdTomato). By 7 days 
post infection (d.p.i.), infected neocortical ECs were observed, regardless of the route of 
infection (Fig. 1a,b,d–e, Supplementary Fig. 1a,f). The appearance of multiple organisms 
within a single parasitophorous vacuole (PV) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) 
displacement indicates the presence of replicating parasites within the ECs (Fig. 1b,d,e). 
This observation was unexpected, as ECs have not been described as a major target of T. 
gondii in vivo. By 8 d.p.i., the foci of parasite replication were located in the parenchyma of 
the neocortex, but were still closely associated with ECs lining the blood vessel (Fig. 1c and 
Supplementary Fig. 1b,c). By 15 d.p.i., a time point when the cyst form of the parasite starts 
to appear in the central nervous system (CNS), these latent developmental stages could be 
identified based on size and morphology and were observed within the neocortex 
parenchyma in close proximity to blood vessels (Supplementary Fig. 1e). Flow cytometry 
was used to identify ECs based on their expression of CD31 and CD102 and the absence of 
CD4518 and at 8 days post oral (Fig. 1f,g) or i.p. (Supplementary Fig. 2) infection, Pru-
tdTomato was detected in ~1.5% of lung ECs and 0.01% of brain ECs (Fig. 1f,g). A normal 
mouse brain harbours approximately 7 million vessel-related ECs19, so it appears that less 
than 1,000 brain ECs were infected at this early time point. These approaches establish that 
during acute toxoplasmosis there is a transient population of infected ECs that precedes 
dissemination into the CNS and presumably other tissues.
Previous reports have described monocytes infected with T. gondii in the blood during acute 
infection, and it has been proposed that these cells transport parasites across the BBB6. In 
our experiments, at similar time points, infected cells present in the blood expressed a 
variety of surface markers (CD11b, CD3, Gr1 and CD11c) associated with monocytes, T 
cells, neutrophils and dendritic cells (DCs) (Supplementary Fig. 3). Similar to previous 
studies6, the intravenous (i.v.) transfer of monocytes infected with a replication-deficient 
strain of T. gondii (CPS)20 into naive or infected mice allowed the detection of infected cells 
in the whole brain at 24 and 48 h post transfer. The invasion of host cells by the CPS strain is 
associated with normal secretion of parasite effectors20,21, and infected monocytes displayed

 hyper-dissemination from sites of infection, as has been reported previously22. However, the 
i.v. injection of an antibody to the cell surface marker CD45 allowed us to distinguish 
vascular and extravascular populations of infected cells, and revealed that these cells were 
exclusively resident in the vascular compartment (Supplementary Fig. 6).
Detection of free T. gondii tachyzoites in the vascular compartment
The data from the previous section indicate that infected monocytes do not readily cross the 
BBB, but the detection of infected ECs suggested that parasites can invade ECs from the 
vascular compartment, directly as free parasites or following egress from infected 
mononuclear cells. Indeed, when whole blood from mice infected orally or i.p. was analysed 
by flow cytometry, a significant population of free tachyzoites was detected (Fig. 2a and 
Supplementary Fig. 4), which correlated with the initial infectious dose (Supplementary Fig. 
4a–e). Following a challenge dose of 1 × 105 parasites i.p. (Fig. 2b), free parasites were first 
detected in the blood at 4 d.p.i., peaked at 6 d.p.i., and by 10 d.p.i. 70% of the mice were 
negative for parasites in this compartment. It is notable that mice deficient in B and T cells 
or IgM secretion maintained high levels of free parasites in the blood (Fig. 2b). Because 
parasite-induced IgM titres start to increase by day 7 post infection23, these data indicate a 
key role for parasite-specific IgM in the control of T. gondii parasitaemia.
To calculate the length of time that free T. gondii tachyzoites circulate in the blood, naive or 
orally infected Tie2-GFP reporter mice were injected i.v. with 1 × 107 to 2 × 107 parasites 
expressing tdTomato (RH-tdTomato) and imaged. Parasites were observed passing through 
the vasculature (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Video 1) for ~10–15 min, but by 30 min 
parasites were rarely detected. Based on the change in number of tachyzoites passing 
through the field of view per minute, the mean circulation half-lives of the parasites in naive 
and infected mice were estimated to be 3.28 ± 0.27 (s.e.m.) min and 2.48 ± 0.21 min, 
respectively (Fig. 3b, P = 0.8955). This short half-life, combined with the number of free 
parasites in the blood, indicates that there is a considerable transient burden of extracellular 
parasites in the blood during acute infection.
T. gondii tachyzoites invade ECs in vivo and in vitro
To determine whether free tachyzoites in the blood could directly invade ECs in vivo, Tie2-
GFP reporter mice were injected i.v. with 1 × 107 to 2 × 107 RH-tdTomato tachyzoites and 
brain explants were surveyed using MP microscopy. Within minutes after injection, infected 
brain ECs could be detected (Fig. 3c). The use of flow cytometry revealed that 1 h after i.v. 
infection, 0.015% and 1.1% of the ECs in the brain and lung, respectively, were infected 
(Fig. 3d,e) and the parasites were preferentially associated with the CD31hi population. 
Thus, free parasites present in the vascular compartment are readily able to invade ECs in 
different tissues.
One feature that was apparent in the brain, regardless of the route of infection, was that 
many of the infected ECs were present in smaller blood vessels, and quantification revealed 
that over 80% of the infected ECs were in vessels with a diameter of less than 10 μm (Fig. 
3f). Because blood flow rates and shear stress levels differ in vessels of different sizes24, 
experiments were performed to investigate whether the flow rate had an impact on EC

 invasion. In these studies, tachyzoites were flowed over a monolayer of primary human 
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in a microfluidic chamber under different shear 
force conditions that reflect those reported in vivo25,26. Cells were then stained with 
antibodies against the dense granule protein GRA7 to identify intracellular parasites. These 
experiments demonstrated that the invasion rate decreased with increasing shear force 
conditions (Fig. 3g). These results are consistent with previous work that implicated 
differential flow rates as a key determinant of the ability of Neisseria meningitides to adhere 
to ECs in cerebral capillaries27, and may explain the preferential localization of T. gondii 
within cerebral capillaries.
To understand the fate of infected ECs, Tie2-GFP reporter mice were infected i.v. with RH-
tdTomato, and were prepared for imaging 2 days later. The i.v. introduction of 
microorganisms has been useful to understand how pathogens disseminate from the 
blood10,13,28–31, and this approach maximized the opportunity to visualize the fate of 
infected cells. At this time point, multiple parasites were observed within a single PV in 
vessels within the meninges and neocortex (Fig. 4a,b), and between 30 and 45 h post 
infection (h.p.i.), parasite egress could be observed. In Fig. 4a and Supplementary Video 2, 
most tachyzoites have exited into the blood vessel lumen, but two tachyzoites remain 
localized in neighbouring cells (Supplementary Fig. 5b–d). In Fig. 4b and Supplementary 
Video 3, following lysis of the infected ECs in a small blood vessel, all parasites remained in 
close proximity. The loss of the GFP signal after parasite egress indicates EC lysis 
(Supplementary Videos 3 and 4). Additional imaging of areas of parasite-mediated EC lysis 
did not reveal recruitment of platelets or neutrophils or overt signs of haemorrhage. These 
studies, together with the images presented in Fig. 1, indicate that parasite replication and 
EC lysis is associated with the development of local foci of replication and dissemination 
into the CNS.
Replication of T. gondii in ECs is required for parasites to cross the BBB
Although our studies demonstrate the unexpected presence of free parasites in the vascular 
compartment and the lysis of infected ECs, it was unclear whether these latter events were 
required for T. gondii to cross the BBB. To address whether extracellular parasites can 
directly access the parenchyma from the blood, mice were injected i.v. with the non-
replicating type I T. gondii strain (CPS-mCherry) or the parental replication competent wild-
type (WT) strain (RH-tdTomato). To distinguish the two fluorescent strains, the CPS strain 
was also labelled with violet cell trace (VCT)21. A 1:1 mixture of these strains was used to 
infect the Tie2-GFP mice i.v., and at 1 h.p.i., the two strains infected a similar frequency of 
ECs in the brain and lung (Fig. 5a). By 48 h.p.i., the replication of the parental strain 
resulted in a 30-fold change in the ratio of infected brain ECs between CPS and RH (where 
RH is the strain used) (Fig. 5a, P < 0.0017). MP microscopy confirmed the high frequency 
of ECs infected with RH in the vasculature of the neocortex at this time (Fig. 5b), and 
tachyzoites were detected within the brain parenchyma of mice infected with the replication 
sufficient parental strain (Fig. 5c). However, in mice infected with CPS-mCherry, single 
parasites could be detected within ECs (Fig. 5d) but not in the parenchyma, indicating that 
these organisms are unable to undergo a para- or trans-cellular transmigration across the 
BBB.

 Because it was possible that the CPS-mCherry parasites cross the BBB but are cleared, 
parasites that secrete Cre recombinase with their rhoptry effector proteins were combined 
with transgenic mice (Ai6), in which the ZsGreen fluorescent reporter protein is under the 
control of a promoter that contains a floxed STOP codon. This system allows the 
identification of cells that had been injected with parasite proteins during invasion32. 
Infection with the RH-Cre strain i.v. resulted in the detection of ZsGreen+ cells beyond the 
vessel wall (white dotted line in Fig. 5e) and in the parenchyma of the neocortex at 48 h.p.i. 
(Fig. 5e,f). In contrast, non-replicating CPS-Cre parasites were able to induce ZsGreen 
expression in the brain, but the location and morphology of these cells identified them as 
ECs (Fig. 5g,h). The lack of spread into the parenchyma by the CPS parasite was not due to 
parasite death, as infected ECs were detected at 24 h.p.i. (Fig. 5g) and 48 h.p.i. (Fig. 5h), but 
these results do not rule out the possibility that nutrient stress of these mutants might affect 
the events required for egress and invasion of new host cells. Furthermore, fluorescence-
activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of mononuclear cell preparations prepared from the 
brain at 72 h.p.i., which excluded the EC populations, confirmed the presence of ZsGreen+ 
cells in mice infected with the WT strain but not with the CPS-Cre mutant (Fig. 5i). These 
data establish that tachyzoites of T. gondii do not readily translocate into the brain, and 
replication within and lysis of ECs precedes parasites crossing the BBB.
Discussion
The availability of transgenic and replication-deficient parasites combined with reporter 
mice and intravital imaging has allowed us to visualize and characterize the interactions of 
T. gondii with ECs. Although there is evidence that the ‘Trojan horse’ mechanism has a role 
in the dissemination of T. gondii from local sites of infection4,33,34, we were unable to show 
that infected cells crossed the BBB in naive or infected mice. Rather, the natural host–
pathogen system utilized here provides an alternative explanation for how T. gondii invades 
the CNS, and demonstrates the presence of free parasites in the blood and that this organism 
compromises the BBB by invading, replicating in, and lysing ECs. There are still many basic 
questions about the processes used by neurotropic pathogens to access the CNS, and this 
mechanism may be relevant to other viral, bacterial parasitic and fungal organisms that 
disseminate through the blood and can infect ECs in vitro3,14,15,35. For T. gondii, the finding 
that IgM is required to resolve the parasitaemia suggests that prophylactic antibody 
treatment may prove useful to specifically limit the ability of extracellular parasites in the 
blood to disseminate to the brain as well as other clinically relevant sites such as the placenta 
and eye.
Our studies also highlight new questions about the interactions between ECs and T. gondii 
that are relevant to the pathogenesis of this disease. There are other pathogens, such as the 
Nipah virus, that replicate extensively in ECs and are associated with haemorrhagic 
disease36. However, our preliminary studies indicate that T.gondii-mediated EC lysis was 
not associated with local haemorrhages, perhaps because this is a relatively isolated event, or 
because T. gondii may have evolved mechanisms of parasite egress that limit bystander 
damage. Nevertheless, there is a significant parasite burden in the blood, and additional 
studies are needed to understand its impact on inflammation in the vascular compartment 
and whether ECs can be activated in vivo to control parasite replication. The other major

 question relates to the preferential localization of T. gondii in cerebral microvessels and 
whether there is a tropism for capillary or post-capillary venules, and if the lower blood flow 
rate and/or increased surface area in capillaries explains parasite localization. It is known 
that, in vivo, in vessels with low shear stresses, particularly at bifurcations, there are unstable 
flow conditions that include ‘stagnant’ blood areas27. These types of event may provide 
sufficiently low velocities to allow free tachyzoites of T. gondii the opportunity to adhere to 
and invade ECs.
For T. gondii, and other apicomplexans including Neopsora and Hammondia, the 
development of cysts in tissues distal from initial sites of infection is a key factor in the 
transmission of these organisms37. Consequently, the ability to cross EC barriers is essential 
for parasite success, and the ability of T. gondii to infect and lyse ECs provides an 
unanticipated mechanism to overcome this bottleneck. For other vector-borne 
apicomplexans, the relationship with ECs is different: some avian and reptilian Plasmodium 
species initially replicate within ECs, while in Plasmodium falciparum and Babesia species 
the ability of infected erythrocytes to adhere to ECs allows parasite sequestration to avoid 
clearance and promote transmission38. The varied interactions of apicomplexan parasites 
with ECs reflect the different strategies used by these organisms to evade the immune 
system and to facilitate transmission, highlighting the importance of pathogen–EC 
interactions for microorganisms present, even transiently, in the vascular compartment.
Methods
Mice and infections
Seven- to eight-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Taconic Farms. Tie2-
GFP, Ai6 and RAG mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratories and were bred in the 
University Laboratory Animal Resources facilities at the University of Pennsylvania and 
used at seven to ten weeks of age for experiments. All procedures were performed in 
accordance with the guidelines of the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Animal Care 
and Use Committee. RH-OVA-tdTomato and Pru-OVA-tdTomato parasites were grown in 
human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) monolayers cultured with D10 media (DMEM, 25% M199 
supplement, 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin (10,000 mg/ml), 0.5% 
gentamycin (50 mg/ml)) as described previously39. The HFFs were purchased from the 
ATCC; they were not authenticated in this laboratory but were periodically tested for 
mycoplasma contamination using an antigen detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 
RH-Cre-mCherry and CPS-Cre-mCherry parasites were obtained from J. Boothroyd and A. 
Koshy and passaged as described in ref. 40. Mice were infected either i.p. with 1 × 104, 1 × 
105 or 1 × 106 tachyzoites in 100 μl PBS, i.v. with 1 × 107 to 2 × 107 tachyzoites in 50 μl 
PBS, or orally with 300 cysts in 0.2 ml PBS. For the competition assays the RH or CPS 
strain of T. gondii were stained with CellTrace Violet (Life Technologies).
Experimental design and statistical approaches
In individual experiments, mice of the same sex, age and strain were used to avoid bias, and 
there was no randomization or blinding of experimental groups. The sample size utilized 
was determined based on individual experiments, and for the imaging experiments

 individual mice were considered biological replicates. In the studies to quantify the numbers 
of infected ECs, groups of three to five mice were used, and individual mice were 
considered technical replicates. No mice were excluded from analysis. For experiments 
where we expected a variability representing <40% of the mean for each group, five mice 
per group were used to exceed a confidence interval of 95%. Statistical significance was 
determined using a Student’s t-test.
MP microscopy
Mice were anaesthetized and maintained at a core temperature of 37 °C. Thinned-skull and 
open-skull surgery were performed as described previously41. For ex vivo imaging, mice 
were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation, and the brains were removed immediately with 
minimal mechanical disruption and placed in a heated chamber where specimens were 
constantly perfused with warmed (37 °C), oxygenated medium (phenol-red free RPMI 1640 
supplemented with 10% FBS, Gibco). The temperature in the imaging chamber was 
maintained at 37 °C using heating elements, and was monitored using a temperature-control 
probe (Fine Science Tools). Imaging was performed with a Leica SP5 two-photon 
microscope system (Leica Microsystems) equipped with a picosecond or femtosecond laser 
(Coherent). The standard wavelength used for the two-photon imaging was 900 nm, which 
allowed optimal excitation of the used fluorophores, except mCherry, expressed by the RH-
Cre strain. Therefore, acquiring the same image with wavelengths of 900 and 820 nm helped 
to identify ZsGreen positive cells as well as parasites in the parenchyma. Images were 
obtained using a ×20 water-dipping lens. The resulting images were analysed with Volocity 
software (PerkinElmer).
Isolation of lung and brain cell preparations
Mice were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation and then perfused with 20 ml cold PBS and 20 
ml RPMI medium containing 1 mg ml−1 collagenase A and 200 μg DNAse. Lungs were 
additionally lavaged with RPMI medium containing 1 mg ml−1 collagenase A and 200 μg 
DNAse. After removal, the brain was homogenized by syringe passages through 18-, 22- and 
26-gauge needles, then digested in 5 ml RPMI medium containing 1 mg ml−1 collagenase A 
and 200 μg ml−1 DNAse for 1 h at 37 °C. The cell suspension was then washed and 
fractionated on a 25–50% percoll gradient (Pharmacia) for 20 min. The cells at the interface 
consisted of brain ECs, which were washed before analysis. After removal, the lungs were 
diced, passed through an 18-gauge needle, and digested in 5 ml RPMI medium containing 1 
mg ml−1 collagenase A and 200 μg DNAse for 45 min at 37 °C. The lung homogenate was 
filtered through a 40 μm strainer, cells were washed, and red blood cells were lysed using 
lysis buffer (0.846% NH4Cl). These preparations were then used for flow cytometry, and the 
absence of CD45 and expression of CD102 and CD31 were used to identify ECs. For the 
data sets presented, cell populations were pre-gated on CD45−veCD102+ve cells and, based 
on a comparison with the fluorescent minus one (FMO) control, almost 100% of these cells 
were CD31+ve. To identify infected ECs, the data shown were pre-gated on 
CD45−veCD102+ve cells and were presented showing CD31 expression versus tdTomato. A 
similar procedure was performed for the isolation of brain mononuclear cells, but the cell 
suspension was fractionated on a 30–60% percoll gradient.

 Flow-cytometric analysis and Amnis ImageStream
Freshly isolated ECs were stained in FACS buffer (0.5% BSA, 2 mM EDTA in PBS). Cells 
were stained with CD45-APC-eFluor-780 antibodies purchased from eBioscience and with 
CD31 (PECAM1)-AF488 and CD102(ICAM2)-AF647 purchased from Biolegend. The 
stained samples were run on an LSRFortessa cell analyser, and the results were analysed 
using FlowJo software (TreeStar). Whole blood was obtained by cardiac puncture. To 
prevent coagulation, whole blood was collected in 3.8% sodium citrate. For the detection of 
free parasites, whole blood was diluted in PBS and immediately subjected to analysis on the 
LSRFortessa cell analyser. Free parasites were identified by their size and expression of 
tdTomato. The gate for free parasite was drawn on freshly isolated tachyzoites from cell 
culture. Amnis ImageStream was used to visualize infected cells in the blood. White blood 
cells were purified using whole blood from infected mice, which was layered on top of 
Lympholyte (Cedarlane) and centrifuged at room temperature. The mononuclear preparation 
was removed and washed in FACS buffer. Cells were then stained in FACS buffer with 
CD11b-APC-e780, CD11c-APC and Gr1-PE-Cy7 from eBioscience and CD3-FITC from 
BD Biosciences. The stained samples were then used for analysis.
Adoptive transfer of infected monocytes
Monocytes were isolated from femur and tibia of naive mice using a monocyte isolation kit 
(#130-100-629, Miltenyi Biotec). Isolated monocytes were stained with CellTrace Violet 
(Life Technologies) in PBS at 37 °C. After staining, cells were washed twice with RPMI 
medium containing 10% FBS. Monocytes were then infected for 1 h with CPS-Cre-mCherry 
with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1/20 in media containing 10% FBS at 37 °C After 
infection, cells were washed twice with PBS and 1 × 106 cells were i.v. transferred into 
naive or previously infected mice. To distinguish cell populations localized in the vascular or 
extravascular compartments, mice were injected i.v. with CD45-APC-eFluor-780. Within 10 
min, the mice were euthanized, and mononuclear cells from the brain were prepared as 
described above and assessed by flow cytometry.
Fluidic experiments
Microfluidic devices were fabricated using polydimethylsiloxane and coverglass, coated 
with fibronectin, and seeded with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs, Lonza), 
as described previously42. In the Lodoen laboratory, mycoplasma screening was performed 
in all parasite and cell culture lines, monthly and whenever they obtained or thawed new 
lines. All cells used in these studies were mycoplasma negative. HUVECs were cultured for 
at least 24 h to a confluent monolayer before experimentation. The barrier integrity of the 
HUVECs was assayed by trans-epithelial electric resistance (TEER) assays and fluorescein 
isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran transwell assays. Fluidic channels were perfused with 2.88 × 
108 GFP expressing type II PA7 tachyzoites at shear forces of 1, 3, 6 or 10 dyn cm−2 using 
an 11 Plus dual syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus), as described previously42,43. Parasites 
were flowed for 1 h, after which the monolayer was immediately fixed with 4% 
paraformaldehyde. To quantify parasite invasion, the monolayer was permeabilized and 
stained for vacuolar GRA744. Anti-GRA7 antibody (12B6) was a gift from P. Bradley 
(University of California). Fluorescence and differential interference contrast images were

 acquired on a Nikon Eclipse TI inverted fluorescence microscope using ×20 and ×40 
objectives. ImageJ was used to quantify intracellular parasites per 100 HUVECs from at 
least 22 fields of view for each independent experiment. Non-blinded experiments were 
performed using technical duplicates or triplicates for the fluidic channels, and for each 
condition there were two or three biological replicates.

 Figure 2. Detection of free T. gondii tachyzoites in the vascular compartment
C57BL/6 mice were infected with 1 × 105 T. gondii tachyzoites expressing tdTomato, and 
the blood was analysed by flow cytometry. a, Representative flow cytometry plots of 
tdTomato versus forward scatter (FSC) as a measure of cell size show the ability to 
distinguish free parasites from infected cells. Parasites isolated from tissue culture are shown 
in the first panel and have a low FSC and are detected in a tight left gate. Cell associated 
parasites have a high FSC and are present in a broader right gate. They can be detected in 
infected mice starting at day 4 post infection, but are absent by day 10. b, Kinetics and 
quantification of free and cell-associated parasites in the blood. Lymphocyte-deficient 
(RAG) mice and secretory IgM-KO (sIgM) mice are unable to control the parasite burden. 
Data are from three independent experiments and each dot represents a single mouse (n = 20 
mice per experiment).

 Figure 5. Replication of T. gondii in ECs is required for parasites to cross the BBB
a, Representative flow cytometry plots of a competition assay between RH-tdTomato and 
CPS-mCherry. The CPS strain was labelled with VCT to distinguish the two strains, and 
Tie2-GFP mice were infected i.v. with a 1:1 ratio of parasites. ECs in the lung and brain 
were analysed after 1 h and 48 h, and the ratio of RH:CPS in the brain was calculated at 
these time points. The histogram shows mean ± s.e.m., and data are pooled from three 
independent experiments (n = 3 mice per time point and experiment). b–d, Representative
