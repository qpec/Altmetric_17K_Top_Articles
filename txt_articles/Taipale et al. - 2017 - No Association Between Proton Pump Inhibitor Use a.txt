ABSTRACT 
INTRODUCTION: Objective was to investigate whether PPI use is associated with an increased risk 
of clinically verified Alzheimer’s disease (AD).  
METHODS: A Finnish nationwide nested case-control study MEDALZ includes all community-
dwelling persons with newly diagnosed AD during 2005-2011 (N=70,718), and up to four age-, sex- 
and region of residence matched comparison persons for each case (N=282,862). Data were 
extracted from Finnish nationwide health care registers. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use was 
derived from purchases recorded in the Prescription register data since 1995 and modelled to drug 
use periods with PRE2DUP method. AD was the outcome measure.  
RESULTS: PPI use was not associated with risk of AD with 3 year lag window applied between 
exposure and outcome (adjusted OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.00-1.05). Similarly, longer duration of use was 
not associated with risk of AD (1-3 years of use, adjusted OR 1.01 [95% CI 0.97-1.06], >3 years of use 
adjusted OR 0.99 [95% CI 0.94-1.04]). Higher dose use was not associated with an increased risk 
(≥1.5 defined daily doses per day, adjusted OR 1.03 [95% CI 0.92-1.14]).  
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we found no clinically meaningful association between PPI use and risk 
of Alzheimer´s disease. The results for longer duration of cumulative use or use with higher doses 
did not indicate dose-response relationship.

INTRODUCTION 
Dementia disorders including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the major public health concerns 
due to population aging [1,2]. The number of persons affected (35.6 million in 2011) is estimated to 
double every 20 years in becoming decades. Dementia results in decline in cognitive and functional 
abilities leading to dependence of help provided by other people and consequently, substantial 
health care costs [3]. Thus, investigation of potentially modifiable risk factors for dementia and 
Alzheimer’s disease is urgently needed.  
 
Drug use may represent such modifiable risk factor, and several drugs have been associated with 
risk of dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. Some of them, such as benzodiazepines and related 
drugs[4-7] or anticholinergic drugs[8] have potential direct links to the condition. Recently, another 
drug group, with perhaps less direct link to cognition, namely proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use was 
associated with an increased risk of incident dementia (HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.36-1.52) in a German 
claims database[9] and in a German cohort study [10]. The association between PPIs and 
Alzheimer’s disease is based on results from cellular and animal models suggesting that lansoprazole 
may enhance production of amyloid-β [11] and accumulation of amyloid-β is an essential event in 
the pathogenesis of AD.  Another mechanism hypothesized is that PPIs inhibit also vacuolar proton 
pumps (V-ATPases) on microglial lysosomes which leads to less acidic lysosomes and their reduced 
capability to degrade fibrillar amyloid-β, a degradation product of amyloid-β [12]. 
 
Objective of our study was to investigate whether PPI use is associated with an increased risk of 
incident, clinically verified Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in a Finnish nationwide nested case-control 
study. In addition to comparing the risk between users and non-users, we investigated the dose-
response relationship and the association between specific PPIs and AD risk.

METHODS 
The MEDALZ study includes all community-dwelling persons diagnosed with AD during 2005-2011 
in Finland (N=70,718). For a nested case-control design, up to four matched comparison persons 
were identified for each case (N=282,862) [13].  
 
Data sources 
Data were extracted from Finnish nationwide health care registers, including Special 
Reimbursement Register, Prescription Register, Hospital Discharge Register and the censuses 
maintained by Statistics Finland. These registers have been described in detail previously [14]. Each 
resident is assigned a unique social security number which was utilized to link data from these 
registers. The linkage was conducted by the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (SII). In Finland, 
all citizens/ residents are covered by tax-supported public health care service and have unrestricted 
access to health care services, regardless of their socioeconomic status.  
 
All data was de-identified before submission to the research team and therefore ethics committee 
approval was not required according to Finnish legislation. 
 
 
AD cases 
The Finnish Clinical Care Guideline for cognitive disorders recommends that all persons with 
suspected cognitive problems should be referred to specialist care and if diagnosis is confirmed to 
be AD, use of anti-dementia drugs should be initiated if there is no contraindication for use [15]. 
The diagnostic process is conducted according to a predefined protocol which includes computed 
tomography or MRI scan and is based on the NINCDS-ADRDA[16] and DSM-IV criteria. Certificate of 
 7 
 
the fulfillment of the diagnostic criteria confirmed by a geriatrician or neurologist is sent for 
evaluation to the SII which grants special reimbursement if criteria are fulfilled. The diagnoses of AD 
is recorded in the Special Reimbursement register from which they were identified for this study. 
All AD diagnoses in the MEDALZ cohort were made during between January 2005 and December 
2011. 
 
Controls 
For each AD case, up to four age, sex and region of residence (hospital district) matched controls 
were identified from a register including all residents, maintained by the SII. Criteria for comparison 
persons were that they did not have diagnoses of AD or anti-dementia drug purchases for one year 
after being selected as controls. After this, controls may became cases and four controls are 
matched for them as described. Controls were matched on the date of AD diagnoses which is 
referred as index date.  
 
Exposure 
Use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) was defined according to Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical –
classification system (ATC) [17] as A02BC. PPI use was extracted from Prescription register since 
1995 (the beginning of the register) and until the index date. The Prescription register includes 
purchases of reimbursed drugs which were modelled with PRE2DUP method[18] to drug use 
periods, i.e. when drug use started and ended for each person and for each drug. Drug use periods 
were constructed according to individual purchase histories and taking account on variation in 
purchase events. The method takes into account on stockpiling of drugs and periods in hospital care 
when drug use is not recorded in the register. The modelling is based on sliding averages of daily 
dose in defined daily doses (DDDs) [19]. For this study, drug use periods of each PPI drug substance 
 8 
 
were combined to retrieve duration of “any PPI use”. For each person, cumulative duration of any 
PPI use were summed together from the observation period which started on 1995 and continued 
until the index date (in analyses without a lag window) or until the beginning of the lag window. For 
each person, we also calculated cumulative PPI dose divided by the follow-up time by dividing 
cumulative dose in DDDs from all PPIs used during the observation period by cumulative duration 
of any PPI use.  The reference DDD values for drugs used by the study cohort were: esomeprazole 
30 mg, lansoprazole 30 mg, omeprazole 20 mg, pantoprazole 40 mg and rabeprazole 20 mg [17]. 
 
Lag windows 
Due to long latency for AD to develop and to account for reverse causality (i.e., AD or its prodromal 
symptoms affecting the PPI use), lag windows of 3 and 5 years were used in addition to analyses 
without any lag window (to represent what can occur without a lag).  The lag window means that 
PPI use during a 3 or 5 year period before AD diagnoses was not considered in analyses, and all 
covariates were measured before the lag window. Time before the lag window is referred as 
observation period.  
 
Covariates 
 
Comorbid conditions were identified from Special reimbursement (since 1972), Hospital discharge 
(since 1972) and Prescription register (since 1995). The Special reimbursement register includes 
data on persons eligible for higher reimbursement of drugs due to certain chronic disease which are 
diagnosed according to predefined diagnostic protocol, as AD. The diagnoses can be made in 
inpatient or outpatient care. Hospital Discharge register includes data on hospital stays and 
discharge diagnoses reported by the attending physician according to ICD classification. 
 9 
 
Comorbidities identified from Special reimbursement register included cardiovascular diseases (any 
of the following conditions: hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic heart failure, chronic 
arrhythmias), and diabetes. History of depression and stroke were identified from hospitalizations. 
Comorbidities were measured as any diagnoses recorded during the observation period (since the 
beginning of the registers 1972) and this ensures the same follow-up time for case and his/ her 
controls as they are matched on the date of AD diagnoses for the case. The number of any drugs 
used was calculated at the beginning of the lag window or at the index date when lag window was 
not utilized. The number of drugs was used as a proxy for comorbidity burden and categorized as 0, 
1-4, 5-9, ≥10. 
 
Statistical Analysis 
 
Descriptive statistics were conducted with means (with standard deviations, SDs), medians (with 
interquartile ranges, IQRs) and chi squared tests for categorical variables. Use of PPIs was compared 
between cases and controls.  
 
Due to matched design, the association between PPI use and AD was investigated with conditional 
logistic regression with adjusting for covariates (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, history of 
depression, history of stroke and number of drugs). Odds ratios (ORs) are represented with 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs). Primary analyses compared any PPI use with no use. Duration of PPI use 
was categorized as <1, 1-3 and ≥3 years of use during the observation period and compared with no 
use. Use ≥3 years is referred as long-term use. PPI dose was categorized as 0, 0.0001-0.4999, 0.5-
0.9999, 1.0-1.4999 and ≥1.5 DDDs per day (0 being the reference category). All analyses were 
 10 
 
conducted with three lag windows, i.e. no lag window (the follow-up until the index date), 3 years 
and 5 years lag windows. 
 
 
 11 
 
RESULTS 
Median age of persons with AD was 80.8 (IQR 76.1-84.9) years and similar among persons without 
AD (80.8, IQR 76.0-84.8) due to matched design. The number of drugs was higher in cases (p<0.0001) 
and also comorbidities were more prevalent among persons with AD compared with persons 
without AD (Table 1). Use of PPIs was frequent among both persons with and without AD. With no 
lag window for PPI use, 44.1% of cases and 42.3% of controls used PPIs. With 5 year lag window, the 
prevalence of PPI use decreased to 26.2% of cases and 24.9% of controls.  
 
Any PPI use during the observation period was not associated with risk of AD (Table 2). Although 
the ORs were suggestive of increased AD risk among PPI users, the difference in prevalence of PPI 
use between cases and controls was very small (<2%) and the confidence intervals also included 1 
in models without lag window and 3-year lag window. The results, and the magnitude of absolute 
difference in exposure prevalence between cases and controls remained similar with 5 year lag 
window.  
 
Long-term cumulative use was not consistently associated with AD. A protective association 
between long-term use and AD was observed in the model without lag window, but the association 
was abolished when a lag window was applied. Instead, <1 year of use was slightly associated with 
AD with all lag windows. 
 
There was no suggestion of dose-response relationship between cumulative dose divided by drug 
use time and AD (Table 3). The highest dose category was associated with higher risk of AD in the 
model without lag window, but this was no longer evident in models with 3 or 5 year lag window.  
The second highest dose category (1-1.49) was associated with minor risk with all lag windows. 
 12 
 
No specific PPI drug substance was significantly associated with AD risk (Table 4). Although 
lansoprazole was associated with slightly higher relative risk of AD in the lag window models, the 
absolute difference in the history of lansoprazole use between cases and controls was very small 
(<0.5%).

DISCUSSION 
Contrary to the previous study [9], we did not find clinically meaningful association between PPI use 
and AD. Even long-term PPI use (≥3 years) or the highest dose category (≥1.5 DDDs per day) were 
not associated with an increased risk when reverse causality was controlled by using 3 or 5 year lag 
window between exposure and outcome. Although there was some suggestion that <1 year PPI use 
was related to higher relative risk of AD in comparison to non-users, the difference in absolute 
prevalence was small. Further, there was no evidence for a dose-response relationship. Thus, it is 
unlikely that the association between short-term use and AD reflects causality. 
 
There are considerable differences between the study designs of this study and the German study 
[9]. In our study, the cases had clinically verified AD diagnosis whereas the German study assessed 
any dementia disorders recorded in the claims data. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form 
of dementia accounting for 60-70% of the cases [2]. Thus, it is likely that majority of dementia cases 
in the previous study had to be AD. However, as the proposed mechanisms found in cellular and 
animal models imply that PPIs would interfere amyloid-β degradation [11,12], one would expect 
that the potential association between PPIs and AD would be stronger when investigating 
specifically persons with AD instead of any dementia disorders.  
 
Compared to previous study [9], our study included higher number of AD cases (70,718 compared 
with 29,510, respectively), resulting in larger number of PPI users. The present study was based on 
drug exposure modelled from data on purchased drugs, and the previous study was based on drugs 
prescribed by a physician. Purchase-based data is considered more valid source than data on drugs 
prescribed by a physician as it avoids primary nonadherence problem (i.e. drugs never bought from 
pharmacy) compared with prescribing information [20]. In addition, PPIs were not available as over-
 14 
 
the-counter drugs during our study period with 3 and 5 year lag windows. Thus, exposure 
misclassification is our study was minimized. Omeprazole was one of the most commonly used PPI 
in both this and previous study. Thus, the different results are not explained by differences in utilized 
drug substances. Further, none of the PPIs were associated with AD in drug specific analyses. 
 
We were also able to assess potential dose-response relationship between PPI use and risk of AD. 
Because AD has a long latency period, we controlled for possible reverse causality by inserting a lag 
window between PPI use and AD. The crucial impact of the lag period is most evident in dose 
analyses in which the highest dose category implies a higher risk when no lag window between 
exposure assessment and AD is applied but no risk is observed when a lag window of 3 or 5 years is 
applied. Similarly, the “protective” association of long-term use that was observed in the model 
without lag window was no longer evident when a lag window was applied. The lack of dose-
response in both dose and in duration of use underline the lack of clinically meaningful association 
between PPI use and AD.  
 
Strengths of our study include nationwide representativeness of all diagnosed AD cases. The Finnish 
health care system and registers cover all citizens despite their socioeconomic position or age. AD 
diagnoses were clinically verified according to international criteria. Due to the length of the follow-
up, we were able to investigate the impact of lag window between exposure and outcome and to 
reduce possibility of reverse causality bias. Our drug use data was based on dispensed instead of 
prescribed drugs and thus, avoided primary nonadherence issue. All PPI drugs were reimbursed 
consistently during the observation period and not available over-the-counter. Further, we utilized 
PRE2DUP method to model duration of drug use from drug purchases [18]. This, together with the 
dose analyses, enabled investigation of the impact of drug use patterns on AD risk.  
 15 
 
 
The register-based nature of the data comprises some limitations. According our national guidelines 
of care the diagnosis of AD should be made in early state [15]. However, we do not know was the 
AD in early or in moderate state at the time of diagnosis. That is why long lag time is needed in the 
analysis. Although the diagnosis of AD is mainly conducted in outpatient care other diagnoses such 
as depression was available only from diagnoses recorded during the hospital stays and likely 
represents only the most severe cases. Register-based data also lacks information on severity of the 
comorbid conditions. As our study is observational study, there is a possibility of residual 
confounding. 
 
In conclusion, we found no consistent or clinically meaningful association between PPI use and risk 
of Alzheimer´s disease. The results for cumulative use were somewhat different depending on the 
applied lag window. Although some associations were statistically significant but, given the results 
were not consistent, they likely are not clinically meaningful. Because the AD disease process has 
been going on for several years before it can be diagnosed it is essential to use a lag window in risk 
factor studies.
