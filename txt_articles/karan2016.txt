reflects dyadic adjustment among couples coping
with breast cancer

Abstract
Dyadic adjustment is integral for couples facing breast cancer; therefore, it is important to identify its everyday
indicators. A total of 52 couples coping with breast cancer wore the Electronically Activated Recorder (EAR) for one
weekend and completed the Dyadic Adjustment Scale to investigate how dyadic adjustment manifests in
noncancer-related word use. Multilevel models revealed that partners’
, rather than one’
s own, positive emotion words
positively related to dyadic adjustment. Conversely, spouses’negative emotion words and patients’anger words were
negatively related to dyadic adjustment. Furthermore, focus on spouses rather than patients (spouses “I” and patients
“you”) positively related to dyadic adjustment. Results revealed that dyadic adjustment can be reflected in couples’
everyday word use, serving as an objective indicator of marital quality.
The diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer is
a distressing experience for patients and their
spouses (Compas & Luecken, 2002; Segrin,
Badger, Sieger, Meek, & Lopez, 2006). Cop-
ing ability can be contingent, in part, on the
quality of the relationship between patients
and spouses. In weak romantic relationships,
patients’ ability to cope becomes impaired,
consequently
hindering
their
adjustment
(Bloom, 1982). Therefore, it is essential to
examine how thoughts, feelings, and behav-
iors between patients and spouses contribute
to and maintain marital quality—or dyadic
adjustment—in a coping context (Burgess &
Cottrell, 1936; Burgess, Locke, & Thomes,

Dyadic adjustment facilitates coping with
breast cancer. For example, metastatic breast
cancer patients tend to have less distress when
they are part of a couple that has the ability and
motivation to help each other (Giese-Davis,
Hermanson, Koopman, Weibel, & Spiegel,
2000). Such relationship skills can be trained
in couples coping with breast or gynecological
cancer, consequently resulting in reduced
coping effort and long-term psychological
distress (Scott, Halford, & Ward, 2004). In
turn, couples with high dyadic adjustment may
already employ these skills. That is, better
dyadic adjustment likely operates by encour-
aging active engagement and communication
of needs, thereby facilitating more effective
coping with cancer (Manne et al., 2006).
Dyadic adjustment is also influenced by the
coping process itself. One study revealed that
breast cancer patients and their spouses both
experienced poorer dyadic adjustment when
they engaged in maladaptive coping behaviors
(e.g., avoiding each other; Badr, Carmack,
Kashy,
Cristofanilli, & Revenson,
2010);

conversely,
dyadic
adjustment
improved
when patients reported receiving tangible and
emotional support from their spouses (Badr,
Laurenceau, Schart, Basen-Engquist, & Turk,
2010). Altogether, the evidence suggests the
interrelated nature of dyadic adjustment and
coping, efforts must be made to understand
them both during the cancer experience.
As in the studies reviewed here, dyadic
adjustment is measured almost exclusively
with retrospective self-report methods. How-
ever, self-report methods cannot uncover less
intentional behaviors that contribute to or
reflect dyadic adjustment. People most often
speak without thinking about each specific
word to use (e.g., in conversation with a
romantic partner; Pennebaker, 2011). For
this reason, word use can reflect meaningful
psychological constructs that often operate
without conscious choice or awareness. This
study sought to examine everyday word use
within the interactions of couples coping with
breast cancer using a naturalistic observation
method, the Electronically Activated Recorder
(EAR). The EAR directly samples word use
from short audio recordings of participants’
daily environments (Mehl, Pennebaker, Crow,
Dabbs, & Price, 2001; Mehl, Robbins, &
Deters, 2012). The EAR is well suited to
capture habitual word use during natural
interactions. Past research has found that
patients and spouses naturally discuss cancer
approximately 5% of the time, leaving the vast
majority of conversations about other topics
(Robbins, López, Weihs, & Mehl, 2014).
This study focused on noncancer conversa-
tions because they comprised the majority of
couples’everyday interactions.
Use of emotion words and personal pro-
nouns in couples’conversations may relevantly
relate to individual and relationship well-being
for breast cancer patients and their spouses
(Robbins, Mehl, Smith, & Weihs, 2013).
Emotion word use reflects general positivity
and negativity, which can predict trajectories
of well-being. For example, positive emo-
tion word use (e.g., accept, glad, and hope)
has been related to benefit finding among
women with breast cancer (Low, Stanton,
& Danoff-Burg, 2006). Furthermore, effec-
tive emotional expression about a stressful
experience is composed of a greater than aver-
age use of positive emotion and a moderate
use of negative emotion words (e.g., hate,
mad, and scary; Pennebaker & Chung, 2007;
Weinberger, Schwartz, & Davidson, 1979).
For major stressful events, the combination of
positive and negative emotion words is asso-
ciated with an attenuation of stress over time,
while for trivial stress, only positive words
relate to positive outcomes (Han et al., 2008;
Larsen, Hemenover, Norris, & Cacioppo,
2003; Pennebaker, Mayne, & Francis, 1997;
Pennebaker & Seagal, 1999; Stein, Folkman,
Trabasso, & Richards, 1997). In light of this
evidence, we hypothesized that emotion words
would reflect dyadic adjustment. Specifically,
we predicted that daily positive emotion word
use would positively, and negative emotion
word use would negatively, relate to reports
of dyadic adjustment for both partners (Low
et al., 2006; Pennebaker & Seagal, 1999;
Slatcher & Pennebaker, 2006).
Specific types of negative emotion words
also relate to adjustment and can shed light on
additional facets of emotional expression. For
example, one study found that anger words
were related to more depressive symptoms
among breast cancer patients, whereas anxiety
word use was not associated with adjustment
(e.g., Robbins et al., 2013). However, another
study found that anxiety word use among
military spouses was negatively related to
relationship satisfaction—one facet of dyadic
adjustment (Borelli et al., 2014). Furthermore,
sadness word use by breast cancer patients
was associated with family conflict (Robbins
et al., 2013). Because these past studies have
generally found negative associations among
discrete negative emotions and adjustment,
we generally predicted we would also find
negative associations with dyadic adjustment.
However, this was the first study to observe
word use for noncancer conversations within
the daily lives of couples coping with breast
cancer, so we did not hypothesize finer-grained
relationships (e.g., for specific actor or partner
effects).
While emotion words may more explic-
itly express a person’
s state of mind, personal
pronouns tap into a more implicit mindset,
reflecting a speaker’
s attentional focus and
 Word use and dyadic adjustment in couples coping

self-construal (Pennebaker, 2011). It is unsur-
prising, then, that pronoun use predicts dif-
ferent facets of dyadic adjustment. Use of
first-person plural pronouns, or “we-talk”(e.g.,
we, us, our), often positively relates to rela-
tionship quality because it reflects interdepen-
dence between partners (Agnew, Van Lange,
Rusbult, & Langston, 1998; Fitzsimons & Kay,
2004; Simmons, Gordon, & Chambless, 2005).
Among couples coping with illness, spouses’
we-talk tends to predict better health outcomes
specifically for patients (Robbins et al., 2013;
Rohrbaugh, Mehl, Shoham, Reilly, & Ewy,
2008; Rohrbaugh, Shoham, Skoyen, Jensen,
& Mehl, 2012). However, this positive asso-
ciation is not always present (Sillars, Shellen,
McIntosh, & Pomegranate, 1997; Simmons
et al., 2005; Slatcher, Vazire, & Pennebaker,
2008). Because most of the evidence reveals
positive associations between we-talk and rela-
tionship outcomes, we predicted that we would
find this association in couples’ daily con-
versations. We also predicted that spouses’
we-talk would be most strongly associated with
patients’ dyadic adjustment (Robbins et al.,
2013; Rohrbaugh et al., 2008, 2012).
In contrast with we-talk, use of “you”
and “I” in romantic relationships gener-
ally indicates a focus on one individual
rather than a communal outlook but still
has implications for dyadic adjustment. Use
of “you” among romantic partners often
indicates other-focused blaming, and dis-
tancing statements, and frequently negatively
relates to relationship satisfaction (Hahlweg,
Revenstorf, & Schindler, 1984; Sillars et al.,
1997; Simmons et al., 2005; Slatcher et al.,
2008). Conversely, “I” reveals self-focus (Sil-
lars et al., 1997), which is often associated
with positive outcomes in conversation among
couples (Hahlweg et al., 1984; Simmons et al.,
2005; Slatcher et al., 2008). This is attributed
to “I” indicating self-disclosure in personal
communication, potentially facilitating greater
closeness
and
intimacy
in
relationships.
Although use of personal pronouns is a daily
behavior with clear relevance to couples’
relationship quality, the association between
personal pronouns and dyadic adjustment
has not yet been examined where it naturally
occurs, in the context of the everyday lives
of couples coping with cancer. We hypoth-
esized that the use of “I” in couples’ daily
conversations would reflect autonomy and
therefore positively relate to patients’ and
spouses’ own reports of dyadic adjustment
(Sillars et al., 1997) and may also reflect a pos-
itive self-disclosure process between partners,
resulting in positive partner effects (Hahlweg
et al., 1984; Simmons et al., 2005; Slatcher
et al., 2008). In contrast, we predicted use of
“you” would more strongly negatively relate
to partners’
, compared to one’
s own, dyadic
adjustment because of the other-focused,
blaming nature of you (Hahlweg et al., 1984;
Robbins et al., 2014; Sillars et al., 1997;
Simmons et al., 2005).
Method
Participants
Breast cancer patients and their spouses were
recruited during routine oncology appoint-
ments at the Arizona Cancer Center, as
described in a previous report that examined
cancer conversations (Robbins et al., 2014).
Part of these data (21 breast cancer patients)
was also used to study swearing, emotional
support, and depressive symptoms (Robbins
et al., 2011). Patients were considered for
the study if they had a primary diagnosis of
Stage 0, I, II, III, or IV breast cancer. Fur-
ther inclusion criteria required patients to be
receiving chemotherapy or radiation treatment
and have had definitive surgery. Additional
eligibility included: (a) minimum age of 21 for
both partners (patient M = 56, SD = 14; spouse
M = 59, SD = 14), (b) patient and partner must
be in a marriage-like relationship and living
together, and (c) patient and partner must both
be primarily English speaking. A researcher
approached 647 patients or couples at their
oncology appointment, 32.5% (210) met the
inclusion criteria, and 26.7% of the eligible
couples (56) enrolled in the study.
Nine total participants had data that were
unusable. Two couples withdrew after signing
the consent form. The first couple withdrew for
unknown reasons prior to follow-up, and the
second couple viewed the external microphone
as cumbersome. The remaining participants
 4
A. Karan, R. C. Wright, and M. L. Robbins
(two patients and three spouses) had fewer
than 30 sound files due to technical problems.
The final sample consisted of 52 patients and
51 spouses. All patients were female (n = 52),
and 86% of partners were male (nmale = 44;
nfemale = 7). Most patients were diagnosed with
Stages I–III breast cancer (n = 42; 80%), 2
were Stage 0 (4%), 4 were Stage IV (8%), and 4
were unknown (8%). The average relationship
length was 23 years (SD = 16). Patients were
all female, and 81% (n = 42) were Caucasian,
11% (n = 6) Latina, 4% (n = 2) African Amer-
ican, and 4% (n = 2) other/unknown. Spouses
(nmale = 44; 86.3%) consisted of 82% (n = 42)
Caucasian, 16% (n = 8) Latino, and 2% (n = 1)
Asian.
Procedure
Once consent was obtained during their oncol-
ogy appointments, participants scheduled a
time to meet with a member of the research
team for their first study session, which usu-
ally occurred on a Friday afternoon. At the first
visit, participants completed a set of question-
naires that included dyadic adjustment. Par-
ticipants were then provided an introduction
to the EAR. They were told that the device
should be worn as much as possible over the
weekend and were informed that the EAR
would record 50 s of ambient sound at a time
and approximately 10% of their days. Partic-
ipants were informed that the snippets would
be recorded without their awareness, and they
should proceed with their normal, everyday
life as unhindered as possible. They were also
told the EAR would cease recording during
sleeping hours. All participants were explic-
itly told they would have an opportunity to
review all audio recordings prior to anyone lis-
tening to them. Following that weekend, typ-
ically on the Monday, EARs were collected
from the participants, and another battery of
questionnaires, which included demographics
and medical information, was administered.
Participants additionally reported on EAR use
and perceived intrusion of the device. The
researcher and participants then met 2 months
later, where participants completed the first set
of questionnaires again. They were debriefed
and given a password-protected CD containing
all of their sound files to review. There were
over 18,000 sound files collected, and of those,
only one participant deleted just one file. Each
couple received $150 for their participation.
Measures
EAR device
The EAR was software programmed on an HP
iPAQ 100 handheld computer. The device was
set to record 50 s every 9 min. This sampling
rate has been established in previous studies
as a stable estimate of normal daily behavior
(Mehl et al., 2012). The device was housed in
a protective case affixed to participants’waist-
lines, and an external microphone (Olympus
ME-15) was attached to participants’ lapels.
Devices were worn by both patients and their
spouses. The EAR was preprogrammed to not
record for 6 hr during the participants’ pre-
defined normal sleep hours, starting 30 min
after they indicated they typically go to sleep.
The EAR recorded participants’waking days,
from the time the participants received the
device until they went to sleep on Sunday.
This yielded an average of 176 (SD = 57) valid,
waking sound files (approximately 2.4 hr of
data per participant), which was defined as a
file where the participant was wearing the EAR
with no technical difficulties while the partici-
pant was awake.
EAR measures
After participants had the opportunity to
review their sound files, research assistants
transcribed and coded each EAR recording.
The recordings were coded for social inter-
actions. The interactions were coded for with
whom the participant was interacting (i.e.,
spouse, family member, friend, stranger) as
well as whether or not they were talking about
cancer. Each category was dichotomous, rep-
resenting either existence or absence of the
behavior in each sound file.
Two research assistants coded each file, and
the independent sets of coding were then aver-
aged across each participant’
s total set of coded
sound files. One-way random effects intra-
class correlations (ICC[1;2]) yielded scores
ranging from .80 to .98. Given the very high
 Word use and dyadic adjustment in couples coping
5
intercoder agreement, one set of coding per
participant was chosen to select the transcripts
in which participants were talking to their part-
ner about a noncancer-related topic. This study
specifically focused on noncancer conversa-
tions between the couple and focused on the
approximately 95% of normal, daily interac-
tions between the couple that were not about
cancer (Robbins et al., 2014). These transcripts
were first created by one research assistant, and
a second research assistant “cleaned” them for
any errors.
Each participant’
s set of transcripts was ana-
lyzed using Linguistic Inquiry Word Count
(LIWC; Pennebaker, Chung, Ireland, Gonza-
les, & Booth, 2007). LIWC software is an
extensively used text-analysis tool that has
been widely validated with specific regard
to emotion words (Bantum & Owen, 2009;
Tausczik & Pennebaker, 2010) and pronoun
use (Pennebaker, 2011; Pennebaker, Mehl, &
Niederhoffer, 2003). LIWC analyzes text word
by word and categorizes it into different psy-
chological and linguistic categories. The soft-
ware then creates a percentage of word use
(specific category/total word use) by categories
for each individual in the sample. This study
focused on each participant’
s use of positive
emotion words (e.g., care, love), anxiety words
(e.g., worry, distress), anger words (e.g., hate,
resent), sadness words (e.g., cry, woe), and
a category of negative emotions words (e.g.,
bad, harm) that did not contain any of the
former. The negative emotion word category,
exclusive of the three specific negative emotion
word categories, contained all of the remain-
ing words from the original, validated nega-
tive emotion word category (129 words). This
step was taken to allow for the inclusion of
all types of negative emotion word variables
in the same multilevel model to reduce multi-
collinearity (all the specific types of negative
emotion words are contained in the total neg-
ative emotion word category). Analyses also
focused on participants’ use of first-person
plural (we-talk), first-person singular (I), and
second-person (you) pronouns.
Dyadic adjustment
Each participant completed the Dyadic Adjust-
ment Scale (DAS; Spanier, 1976). The DAS
is a widely used, reliable scale that assesses
relationship quality using 32 items that com-
prise four subscales (Cohesion, Consensus,
Satisfaction, and Affection; Graham, Liu, &
Jeziorski, 2006). All responses are summed
to create an overall dyadic adjustment score,
where higher scores indicate better adjust-
ment. Items on the DAS mainly consisted of
5- or 6-point Likert scale questions inquiring
about both positive and negative relationship
questions. A typical Consensus item (n = 13)
asks on a 6-point Likert scale (5 = always
agree, 0 = always disagree) how often you
and your partner agree or disagree on the
“amount of time spent together.” The Affec-
tional Expression subscale consists of 4 items
typically asking either dichotomously or on a
6-point Likert scale how often you and your
partner agree or disagree on “sex relations”
or “demonstrations of affection.” A typical
item in the Satisfaction subscale (n = 10) asks
on a 6-point Likert scale (0 = all of the time,
5 = never) “How often do you discuss or have
considered divorce, separation, or terminat-
ing your relationship?” The final subscale,
Cohesion, consists of 5 items on either a 5- or
6-point Likert scale (0 = never, 5 = more often
than once a day). A typical question asks how
often the couple has “a stimulating exchange
of ideas.” Couples were, on average, very
well adjusted, although there was substantial
variability in this sample (Mpatients = 126.69,
SD = 11.54;
Mspouses = 124.55,
SD = 12.71;
Table 1).
Data analysis
First, Pearson correlations were used to exam-
ine raw associations between word use and
dyadic adjustment before controlling for part-
ner effects among actor effects and vice versa
in the next step of the analyses, and to iden-
tify relevant control variables. These correla-
tions were calculated separately for patients
and their spouses.
Second,
actor–partner
interdependence
models within multilevel modeling in SPSS
(APIM; Kenny, Kashy, & Cook, 2006) were
used to test how patient and spouse word
use related to dyadic adjustment while con-
trolling for the nonindependence between

Note. Emotion words and pronouns are percentage of total words spoken to each other in noncancer conversations. DAS
scores at the top denote total dyadic adjustment scores measured by the Dyadic Adjustment Scale and correspond to the
outcomes of the patient (top) and spouse (bottom). Actor correlations appear in the left column (own word use correlated
with own dyadic adjustment), and partner correlations are in the right column (partner’
s word use correlated with own

partners. APIMs allowed for the investigation
of patients’ and spouses’ word use to their
own (actor effects) and each other’
s (partner
effects) dyadic adjustment. To obtain stan-
dardized, and therefore easily interpretable,
estimates in the APIMs, all predictors and
outcome variables were standardized prior
to being entered in the model. Interactions
between patient or spouse role and actor or
partner effects were further deconstructed if
p ≤ .20 to use a conservative approach for
detecting different effects for patients versus
spouses (Kenny & Ledermann, 2010). Inter-
actions were deconstructed using Case 1 from
Preacher’
s hierarchical linear modeling (HLM)
two-way interaction online tool (Preacher, Cur-
ran, & Bauer, 2006), which yielded the simple
slopes. Confidence intervals for each slope
were then obtained using an online calculator
(http://www.danielsoper.com/statcalc3/calc.
aspx?id=26).
Results
LIWC and DAS means and standard deviations
for both patients and spouses, as well as corre-
lations, are presented in Table 1. Paired sam-
ple t tests were conducted, and no significant
differences between patients and spouses were
found for any of these variables (p > .51). Cor-
respondingly, patients’ and spouses’ positive

7
emotion words and anger words were signifi-
cantly correlated to each other (p < .05).
Potential covariates
Before running APIM analyses, correlations
were run to determine which demographic,
relationship, and medical variables to include
as covariates. Age, length of relationship, stage
of cancer, time since diagnosis, and recurrence
did not significantly correlate with DAS scores
(p > .11) and were therefore not controlled in
any of the following APIMs.
How does emotion word use relate to dyadic
adjustment?
Correlations
First, emotion words and personal pronouns
were correlated with dyadic adjustment to
examine the “raw” associations, and to deter-
mine whether they should be included in
the next step of analyses, the APIMs. LIWC
variables were included in the APIMs if their
correlations were at least marginally signif-
icant, p ≤ .10, for either the spouse or the
patient.

dyadic
adjust-
ment. Spouses’ (r = .23, p = .10), but not
patients’ (r = .21, p = .15), positive emotion
words were marginally positively related to
their own dyadic adjustment, although the
effect sizes were similar in magnitude. Fur-
thermore, spouses’ positive emotion words
were positively related to patients’ dyadic
adjustment (r = .35, p = .01) but not vice versa
(r = .12, p = .41). This suggested that spouses’
,
more than patients’
, positive emotion words
were indicative of couples’ dyadic adjust-
ment. Spouses’ negative emotion words were
also marginally negatively related to their
own reports of dyadic adjustment (r = −.27,
p = .06), whereas patients’ negative emotion
words were statistically unrelated to their
own adjustment (r = .05, p = .72). Examina-
tion of specific negative emotion word use
revealed that patients’
(r = −.25, p = .07), but
not spouses’ (r = −.22, p = .12), anger word
use was marginally negatively related to their
own reports of dyadic adjustment, although
the effect sizes were comparable. Patients’
anger words were also negatively related
to
spouses’ dyadic
adjustment
(r = −.37,
p = .01),
suggesting
that
they
were
par-
ticularly indicative of dyadic adjustment.
Unexpectedly, no correlations were statisti-
cally significant between patients’or spouses’
anxiety words and dyadic adjustment (p > .29).
Finally, patients’ use of sadness words was
marginally negatively related to their own
dyadic adjustment (r = −.23, p = .10), but the
same was not true for spouses (r = −.004,
p = .99).
Actor–partner interdependence models
Dyadic adjustment scores were regressed on
word use variables using APIMs (Table 2).
Patients’and spouses’positive emotion words
positively related to their partners’ (β = 0.36,
p = .03) but not to their own (β = 0.17, p = .27)
dyadic adjustment. While the associations for
positive emotion words were the same for
patients and spouses, the associations between
negative emotion words and dyadic adjust-
ment were different for both actor (β = 0.53,
p = .01)
and
partner
(β = −0.31,
p = .12)
effects. Examination of the simple slopes
revealed that patients’negative emotion words
were not significantly related to their own
dyadic adjustment (β = 0.21, p = .16), while
spouses’ negative emotion words negatively
related to their own adjustment (β = −0.32,
p = .02). Furthermore, only spouses’ negative
emotion words marginally negatively related
to patients’ dyadic adjustment (β = −0.22,
p = .10) and not vice versa (β = 0.09, p = .54),
revealing that spouses’ general negative emo-
tion words reflect poorer dyadic adjustment
for patients and spouses.
However,
the
examination
of
specific
subcategories
of
negative
emotion
words
revealed a different pattern. First, anger words
differed among patients and spouses for
both actor (β = − 0.48, p = .04) and partner
(β = 0.64, p = .02) effects. Patients’ anger
words were significantly negatively related
to their own (β = −0.40, p = .03) and their
spouses’ (β = − 0.42, p = .004) dyadic adjust-

Note. Emotion words and personal pronouns were entered in two separate actor–partner interdependent models (APIMs).
Estimates are all standardized effects. Main effects are reported in the table and are the same for patient and spouse unless
significance reached the p ≤ .20 threshold wherein effects were deconstructed to denote significantly different effects for
patient and spouse. All analyses reported are from the full sample. The magnitude and interpretation of effects did not
differ when analyzed without the same-sex couples. Pt. = patient; Sp. = spouse.

dyadic
adjustment.
This
pattern
suggests that patients’ anger words were par-
ticularly indicative of couples’ poor dyadic
adjustment. Neither actor (β = −0.05, p = .69)
nor partner (β = −0.20, p = .18) effects for
sadness words and dyadic adjustment were
significant.
How does pronoun use relate to dyadic
adjustment?
Correlations
First, we found that the only significant associ-
ation between we-talk and dyadic adjustment
was spouses’ we-talk and their own dyadic
adjustment (r = .32, p = .02; Table 1). How-
ever, because of the particular attention to
we-talk in research on couples’ word use,
we conducted a post hoc correlational anal-
ysis of the subscales of the DAS and found
that spouses’ we-talk was significantly asso-
ciated with their own reports of consensus
(r = .39, p = .005) and patients’ satisfaction
(r = .33, p = .02) and marginally associated
with
spouses’ own
satisfaction
(r = .26,
p = .06). The remaining actor and partner
correlations for we-talk and the four dyadic
adjustment subscales were not significant
(p > .23).
Spouses’ use of “I” was positively cor-
related with their own reports of dyadic
adjustment (r = .37, p = .01), which was the
only significant correlation among the use
of “I” and dyadic adjustment (p > .22). Con-
sidering this in conjunction with the same
pattern for we-talk and dyadic adjustment,
this suggested that spouses’use of first-person
pronouns reflects their own positive dyadic
adjustment. Finally, patients’use of “you” was
significantly related to spouses’ better dyadic
adjustment (r = .27, p = .05), while all other
correlations for “you” were not statistically

9
significant (p > .11). Consistent with the pat-
tern noted above, these associations reveal that
focus on the spouse, rather than the patient,
reflects positive dyadic adjustment.
Actor–partner interdependence models
As with emotion word use, APIMs were used
in a second step of analyses to understand
the relation between both partners’ pronoun
use and dyadic adjustment, controlling for
actor and partner pathways. A main actor
effect for both partners’ use of “I” revealed
a positive association with dyadic adjust-
ment (β = 0.34, p = .02), whereas no main
partner effect emerged (β = −.02, p = .88),
showing that when controlling for interde-
pendence, focus on the self reflects one’
s
own positive dyadic adjustment. The actor
effect for patients’ and spouses’ use of “you”
differed by role (β = 0.50, p = .06), and simple
slope analyses revealed a marginal positive
association between patients’ use of “you”
and their own dyadic adjustment (β = 0.30,
p = .10) with a trend for spouses showing
the opposite relation (β = −0.20, p = .18),
although not statistically significant. In addi-
tion to differing actor effects, different partner
effects (β = −0.51, p = .06) emerged such
that patients’ use of “you” was marginally
positively associated with spouses’ dyadic
adjustment (β = 0.33, p = .06), while patients’
adjustment was not significantly related to
spouses’ use of “you” (β = −0.18, p = .29).
This is consistent with the pattern found in
the correlational analyses that focus on the
spouse, rather than the patient, reflects dyadic
adjustment. We-talk was not significantly
associated with dyadic adjustment in this
model (p > .12).
Discussion
This study examined indicators of dyadic
adjustment—everyday use of emotion words
and
personal
pronouns—among
couples
coping with breast cancer. This was the first
study to use a naturalistic design to elu-
cidate meaningful patterns of word use in
the noncancer conversations between breast
cancer patients and their spouses. Results
revealed that positive emotion words were
reflective of partners’
, but not one’
s own,
dyadic
adjustment.
Furthermore,
spouses’
general negative emotion words were associ-
ated with poorer dyadic adjustment for both
partners. Among specific negative emotion
words, patients’ anger word use emerged
as most indicative of both partners’ poorer
dyadic adjustment. Finally, both partners’
focus on the spouse, as indexed by use of
personal pronouns, indicated better dyadic
adjustment.
Emotion words and dyadic adjustment
As predicted, positive emotion words were
positively associated with partners’ dyadic
adjustment. It was unexpected, however, that
there was no significant actor effect. Although
other studies have found evidence for actor
effects of positive emotion words on positive
outcomes (Low et al., 2006; Pennebaker et al.,
1997; Slatcher & Pennebaker, 2006), these
studies did not test or control for partner
effects and examined written, rather than
spoken, text. This study suggests that partners’
everyday use of positive emotion words, more
than one’
s own use, is more strongly tied
to dyadic adjustment. This is partly consis-
tent with Slatcher et al.’
s (2008) finding that
men’
s positive emotion words in couples’
instant messages were positively related to
women’
s relationship satisfaction. Altogether,
this reveals that relationship quality is more
reflected in the partner’
s positive words rather
than one’
s own. Future studies should test
whether this is a causal association, such
that increasing one partner’
s positive emotion
words leads to increases in the other partner’
s
perception of relationship quality. In sum,
although high relationship quality is, in other
contexts, reflected in one’
s own positive emo-
tion words, attending to a significant other’
s
positivity might be most indicative of a per-
son’
s dyadic adjustment in couples’ everyday
conversations.
General and specific negative emotion
words were mostly negatively related to
dyadic adjustment, as expected. Specifically,
spouses’general negative emotion words were
associated with both partners’ poorer dyadic
 10

adjustment, which is consistent with past
work (Baptist & Nelson Goff, 2012; Robbins
et al., 2013; Rude, Gortner, & Pennebaker,
2004). In the context of coping with breast
cancer, patients tend to seek support from
their spouse, so spouses’ negativity could be
especially detrimental to the coping process
for both partners.
In contrast to general negative emotion
words, only patients’
, and not spouses’
, anger
words reflected both partners’ poorer dyadic
adjustment. To interpret this finding, it is
important to note that swear words are fully
subsumed by anger words. A previous report
studying 21 of the women with breast can-
cer from this sample and 13 women with
rheumatoid arthritis found that swearing in
the presence of others predicted decreased
emotional support and increased depressive
symptoms (Robbins et al., 2011). The results
of this study corroborate the previous conclu-
sion that women’
s, but not men’
s, use of anger
and swear words is related to negative out-
comes, perhaps because of gender stereotypes
(Bird & Harris, 1990).
Sadness and anxiety words were largely
unrelated to dyadic adjustment. However,
all of the regression coefficients for sad-
ness words were in the expected negative
direction. The one statistically significant
association was patients’ sadness words and
spouses’ worse dyadic adjustment. This is
in line with previous research finding that
patients’ sadness words negatively related
to family conflict (Robbins et al., 2013). In
both this and previous studies, only patients’
,
and not spouses’
, sadness word use signif-
icantly related to adjustment. This could be
attributed to gender differences in norms for
expressing emotion (Dindia & Allen, 1992)
or talking about different topics (Newman,
Groom, Handelman, & Pennebaker, 2008).
Future research should continue to explore
contextual factors surrounding word use in
order to further understand this association.
Finally, the use of anxiety words does not
have consistent ties to relationship quality
in past studies and therefore did not allow
for clear a priori hypotheses (e.g., Rob-
bins et al., 2013). This was reflected in this
study as anxiety words did not significantly
correlate with dyadic adjustment and were
thus not included in the APIMs. Further-
more, anxiety words were used infrequently
and had little variation, rendering it diffi-
cult to detect an association with dyadic
adjustment.
Personal pronouns and dyadic adjustment
Counter to prediction, we-talk was not sig-
nificantly associated with dyadic adjustment
when controlling for partners’interdependence
and other personal pronouns in the APIM.
However, the raw associations between we-talk
and dyadic adjustment were positive for both
patient and spouse, adding to the existing liter-
ature of positive findings within patient sam-
ples (Lyons, Mickelson, Sullivan, & Coyne,
1998; Robbins et al., 2013; Rohrbaugh et al.,
2008, 2012). Additionally, this study revealed
that spouses’ use of “I” and patients’ use
of “you” were associated with better dyadic
adjustment. Focus on the spouse in the con-
text of coping with breast cancer can indicate
more balance within the relationship rather
than an exclusive focus on the patient. Past
research has found that the spouses of cancer
patients are more emotionally exhausted and
lose respect for their partners when they feel
that their own needs are not attended (Ybema,
Kuijer, Hagedoorn, & Buunk, 2002). These
findings should be interpreted very cautiously
due to the fact that this study did not mea-
sure inequality in couples’division of labor and
relationship maintenance directly. However, in
conjunction with past research (Ybema, Kuijer,
Buunk, DeJong, & Sanderman, 2001; Ybema
et al., 2002), our results suggest that in the con-
text of couples’ everyday, noncancer interac-
tions, couples without an exclusive focus on
the patient may fare better as a couple. Future
research should determine how much balance
between patient and spouse is optimal for cou-
ples coping with serious illness.
Limitations and future directions
There are important limitations in this study.
The small, mostly Caucasian sample limits
the generalizability of the present findings,
although this study makes an initial step in
 Word use and dyadic adjustment in couples coping
11
studying the relation between noncancer con-
versations among couples coping with breast
cancer. Furthermore, this was a correlational
study, and future work should begin to exam-
ine how aspects of noncancer conversations
among couples may influence dyadic and psy-
chological adjustment. Finally, role (patient vs.
spouse) and gender were almost completely
confounded in this sample. This may alter the
interpretation of our findings where effects dif-
fered by role. For example, we interpreted the
association between patients’anger words and
poorer dyadic adjustment in light of gender
roles, but this study cannot rule out that it
was not due to patient versus spouse roles.
Although it is difficult to completely uncouple
medical and gender roles, a meta-analysis indi-
cated that gender appears to play at least some
role in the experience of distress in coping with
cancer (Hagedoorn, Sanderman, Bolks, Tuin-
stra, & Coyne, 2008). Including equal numbers
of same- and opposite-gender couples in future
studies is important to more directly test the
differences due to patient and spouse role ver-
sus gender effects in coping with cancer.
In sum, this study advances understanding
of how patterns of daily word use in non-
cancer conversations reflect dyadic adjustment
among couples coping with breast cancer. Cou-
ples’ relationships do not cease to be cen-
tral to their lives as they cope with cancer. In
fact, most of couples’ conversations did not
center around cancer (Robbins et al., 2014).
This study revealed that attending to word use
within noncancer conversations can serve as an
observable marker of how a couple’
s relation-
ship is faring in the face of coping with cancer.
