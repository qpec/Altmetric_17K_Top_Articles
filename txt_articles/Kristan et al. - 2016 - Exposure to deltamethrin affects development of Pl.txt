Abstract
Background: Pyrethroid resistance in African vector mosquitoes is a threat to malaria control. Resistant mosquitoes
can survive insecticide doses that would normally be lethal. We studied effects of such doses on Plasmodium
falciparum development inside kdr-resistant Anopheles gambiae s.s. in Uganda.
Methods: We collected An. gambiae s.s. homozygous for kdr-L1014S mutation, fed them on blood samples from 42 P.
falciparum-infected local patients, then exposed them either to nets treated with sub-lethal doses of deltamethrin or to
untreated nets. After seven days, we dissected 692 mosquitoes and examined their midguts for oocysts. Prevalence
(proportion infected) and intensity of infection (number of oocysts per infected mosquito) were recorded for each group.
Results: Both prevalence and intensity of infection were significantly reduced in deltamethrin-exposed mosquitoes,
compared to those exposed to untreated nets. With low doses (2.5–5.0 mg/m2), prevalence was reduced by 59 % (95 %
CI = 22 %-78 %) and intensity by 41 % (95 % CI = 25 %-54 %). With high doses (10–16.7 mg/m2), prevalence was reduced
by 80 % (95 % CI = 67 %-88 %) and intensity by 34 % (95 % CI = 20 %-46 %).
Conclusions: We showed that, with locally-sampled parasites and mosquitoes, doses of pyrethroids that are sub-lethal for
resistant mosquitoes can interfere with parasite development inside mosquitoes. This mechanism could enable
pyrethroid-treated nets to prevent malaria transmission despite increasing vector resistance.

Background
Increased use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) has con-
tributed to substantial reductions in the global burden of
malaria [1]. Unfortunately, various genes conferring re-
sistance to pyrethroids are spreading rapidly through the
main African malaria vectors [2, 3]. However, the impact
of this resistance on vector control remains unclear [4].
Control failure has been associated with resistance in
some areas [5], but not others [6–8].
Pyrethroid-treated nets reduce malaria transmission
partly by repelling vectors, and partly by killing them
[9]. As resistance increases, the proportion of the vector
population
surviving
insecticide
exposure
increases.
Although this is expected to reduce the effectiveness of
vector control, it is possible that transmission might still
be prevented by other mechanisms. One possible mech-
anism is that infection might restore the phenotypic sus-
ceptibility of genetically resistant mosquitoes, so they are
killed by doses that they would survive without the
infection. Another is through a possible effect of the
insecticide on the parasite. With increasing resistance,
the proportion of the vector population exposed to sub-
lethal doses is also expected to increase, which in turn
increases exposure of the parasite to the insecticide.
Exposure of the parasite to these doses inside the
mosquito might affect its development even though
the insecticide fails to kill the mosquito. Either of
these mechanisms could, in theory, allow insecticide

 resistance to evolve in a vector population with little
impact on malaria transmission.
A number of studies have investigated potential effects
of insecticides and insecticide resistance on parasite
development. Resistant mosquitoes infected with Plas-
modium falciparum have been found to be more suscep-
tible to DDT than uninfected mosquitoes [10]. Other
studies reported that Anopheles gambiae with knock-
down resistance (kdr) genes exhibited increased suscep-
tibility to P. falciparum [11, 12].
In one study, exposure to DDT and bendiocarb inhibited
development of P. falciparum in insecticide-resistant An.
gambiae s.s. [13]. Sub-lethal doses of pyrethroids were also
shown to affect development of Plasmodium parasites in la-
boratory conditions [14–16]. However, other studies found
no effect of organochlorines, carbamates and organophos-
phates on parasite development in mosquitoes [17–19].
The late Nigel Hill carried out laboratory-based re-
search at London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine
(LSHTM) on the effects of sub-lethal doses of pyrethroids
on Plasmodium infection rates in An. stephensi mosqui-
toes [17]. He infected pyrethroid susceptible and resistant
mosquitoes with the rodent parasite P. yoelii nigeriensis.
Mosquitoes were exposed to deltamethrin-, permethrin-
and lambda-cyhalothrin-treated nets and papers. Exposure
to these pyrethroids before, during or after infective
feed significantly reduced prevalence of infection under
laboratory conditions. He subsequently carried out
similar laboratory-based experiments using a pyrethroid
resistant An. stephensi strain and a laboratory strain of
P. falciparum. Again, exposure to permethrin shortly
after infective feed caused a significant reduction in the
infection prevalence.
Our aim was therefore to demonstrate that this
phenomenon can occur in the field. We investigated the
effects of deltamethrin exposure of wild, pyrethroid-
resistant An. gambiae s.s. on the sporogonic develop-
ment of P. falciparum parasites obtained from local
patients at a health facility in a malaria endemic area of
Uganda. The range of insecticide exposures was selected
to resemble those that blood-seeking mosquitoes might
be expected to encounter in an area where the nets are
not new, and where the concentration of insecticide on
nets is considerably lower than in new nets.
Methods
Study area and participants
The study was conducted in Butemba, Kyankwanzi
District, mid-western Uganda, between August 2013 and
June 2014. Butemba (approximately 200 km north-west
of Kampala) lies at an altitude of 1000–1200 m above
sea level in a moist savannah zone, with annual rain-
fall exceeding 1200 mm with two peaks (April–May
and September–October). The study site included
the catchment area of Butemba Health Centre III,
which is mostly rural but includes a semi-urban
village of Bukwiri. The area is highly endemic with
two peaks in malaria transmission in May–July and
October–December.
Forty-two
gametocyte
donors
were
recruited
among outpatients at Butemba Health Centre III. Pa-
tients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria (2 years or
older, P. falciparum positive with microscopically de-
tectable gametocytes, no sign of severe illness, non-
pregnant if adult female, and haemoglobin level of
>9.9 g/dl) were recruited. Gametocytes were counted
against 200 leucocytes in thick blood smears. Density
was calculated assuming a standard leukocyte count
of 8000/μL of blood. The experiments were con-
ducted over three rounds (September–October 2013,
November–December 2013, and May–June 2014).
Mosquito collection and rearing
Anopheles gambiae s.l. larvae were collected from breed-
ing sites in villages around the health centre and reared
at the health centre at ambient temperature and humid-
ity. The emerging adult mosquitoes were given 10 %
glucose solution until they were fed on infected blood.
Mosquito species and resistance studies
World Health Organization (WHO) susceptibility tests
were conducted using different classes of insecticides to
assess the phenotypic resistance levels in the study area
[20]. All mosquitoes used in the transmission experi-
ments and the WHO susceptibility tests were stored dry
on silica gel for molecular analysis. Real-time polymerase
chain reaction (qPCR) using TaqMan assays was used
for Anopheles sibling species identification [21], and for
detection of kdr-L1014F or kdr-L1014S mutations [22].
A further assay to detect the presence of G119S muta-
tion in the gene ace-1 which encodes the acetylcholin-
esterase enzyme was also used [23].
Experimental nets
Untreated polyester nets (Vestergaard) were treated with
a range of concentrations (2.5–16.7 mg/m2) of delta-
methrin (K-Othrine SC 10B G, concentration 9.7 g/l;
Bayer CropScience AG). The doses were much lower
than those used on LLINs, and were chosen in an at-
tempt to mimic the concentrations found on nets as
they get older in domestic use [24].
Procedures
Approximately 9 ml blood was collected from each
gametocytaemic volunteer by venepuncture. Gametocyte
density ranged from 34 to 480/μl of blood (excluding
one volunteer who had no microscopically detectable
gametocytes but was nevertheless infectious). Blood

 samples were transferred to pre-warmed membrane
feeders (Hemotek Membrane Feeding System, Hemotek
Ltd, UK) held at 37.5 °C. On average 217 mosquitoes
were used per infective feed (range: 62–799), divided
into paper cups with approximately 40 females in each,
and allowed to feed through an artificial Parafilm mem-
brane for up to 2 h. In most cases, the blood samples
were offered to the mosquitoes within 10 min of being
taken, but in three experiments (23, 28 and 29), they
were kept for up to 1 ½ h in a water bath at 37 °C before
transfer to the membrane feeders. Blood samples from
the 42 volunteers were each used in separate experi-
ments except samples from four volunteers (18, 19, 44
and 45), which were used in two insecticide exposure
experiments each.
Within 1–3 h, approximately half of the blood-fed
mosquitoes were exposed to a net treated with a sub-
lethal dose of deltamethrin for 5 min using a wire ball
frame, and the other half were exposed to an untreated
net as control. After exposure, mosquitoes were kept in
paper cups with access to 10 % glucose solution.
Temperature and humidity were recorded every 30 min
during incubation. Seven days after infection, midguts of
surviving females were dissected in 0.25 % mercuro-
chrome in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) solution and
examined for oocysts.
Statistical analysis
Only data for An. gambiae s.s. with kdr-L1014S homozy-
gous (RR) genotype were included in the statistical ana-
lyses to reduce bias due to genetic heterogeneity. Two
outcome variables were studied: a) prevalence of oocyst
infection and b) intensity of oocyst infection (number of
oocysts) among infected mosquitoes. Mantel-Haenszel
meta-analysis and forest plot were used with the metan
procedure in Stata version 13 (StataCorp LP, College
Station, Texas 77,845, USA) to study the effect of expos-
ure to sub-lethal doses of deltamethrin on Plasmodium
infection in kdr-resistant An. gambiae s.s. mosquitoes,
stratifying by feeding experiment. Odds ratios (OR) were
calculated to estimate the effect of insecticide exposure
on infection prevalence, separately for each gametocyte
donor or experiment. Experimental data from different
insecticide doses were pooled into two exposure groups:
low dose (2.5–5.0 mg/m2) and high dose (10.0–16.7 mg/
m2), as sample sizes for some of the separate doses were
inadequate for the analysis. A Mantel-Haenszel pooled
OR was calculated as a summary measure of exposure
effect across experiments. We used the median of am-
bient temperature recorded during the experiments
(25.3 °C) as cut-off to plot oocyst prevalence charts
under low and high temperature conditions.
The effect of deltamethrin exposure was analysed fur-
ther with multi-level regression models. First, mixed-
effects logistic regression was used to study the effect of
the
insecticide
on
oocyst
infection
rate.
Secondly,
mixed-effects negative binomial regression was used to
study the effect of the insecticide on oocyst count in in-
fected mosquitoes.
In both models, the main independent variable was
deltamethrin dosage group, as a fixed-effect categorical
variable with three levels: control, low dose and high
dose, as defined above. In addition, four more fixed-
effect explanatory factors were included in both models:
the continuous variables average temperature during
incubation, gametocyte density, and age of volunteer,
and a binary categorical variable indicating whether or
not the donor received medication with antimalarials in
the previous seven days. To account for the correlation
of mosquitoes fed on the same blood sample within
each experiment, gametocyte donor volunteers were
included as a random (or group) variable. In each
model, the two-level random-effects models were com-
pared with models with no random effects using log-
likelihood ratio tests to confirm that the mixed-effects
models were more appropriate than standard models.
The melogit and menbreg procedures in Stata 13 were
used to fit the mixed-effects logistic and mixed-effects
negative binomial regressions, respectively.
Ethics statement
Ethical clearance was obtained from the LSHTM (ref-
erence 6454), the Vector Control Division of the
Ministry of Health of Uganda (reference VCD-IRC/
044), and Uganda National Council of Science and
Technology (reference HS 1429). All adult subjects
provided written informed consent, and a parent or
guardian of any child participant provided written in-
formed consent on their behalf.
Results
A total of 9502 An. gambiae s.l. up to 10 days old were
offered an infective blood meal, of which 1285 fully fed.
Of these, 935 survived until dissection. Midguts of 862
of the surviving mosquitoes were dissected successfully
and examined. Out of these, 763 were identified by PCR
as An. gambiae s.s. and 73 as An. arabiensis (26 mosqui-
toes could not be identified by PCR). Of the 763 An.
gambiae s.s., 692 had kdr-L1014S homozygous (RR)
genotype and were included in the statistical analyses
involving effects of deltamethrin on infection.
Resistance gene frequencies
An. gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis were found together
in the study area at a ratio of approximately 10 to 1. All
but one of the An. arabiensis mosquitoes were scored as
SS (homozygote susceptible) at the kdr-L1014S locus,
while in An. gambiae s.s. 95 % of the specimens were RR

 resistant homozygotes (Table 1). All specimens were
homozgygous susceptible at the ace-1 locus.
Mosquito mortality rates
The WHO insecticide susceptibility tests confirmed
presence of resistance against deltamethrin in the An.
gambiae s.l. population in the study site, with 71.9 %
mortality (n = 87). Mortality rates in the mosquitoes fed
with infective blood meals were recorded after 7 days of
incubation: 9.6, 32.5 and 35.5 % died in the groups ex-
posed to untreated nets, and nets treated with the low-
dose and high-dose deltamethrin, respectively (Fig. 1).
Effect of deltamethrin on infection rate
Forty-one of the 42 volunteers had detectable gametocy-
temia and one was found to be infectious despite a
blood smear showing asexual parasites but no visible ga-
metocytes. The mean age of these volunteers was
17 years (range: 2–56 years). Eight volunteers had taken
antimalarial drugs prior to the visit to the health facility;
six took artemether-lumefantrine and two took quinine.
The groups of fed females exposed to deltamethrin
had lower infection rates than those exposed to un-
treated nets. The effect of deltamethrin on infection
rates was more pronounced under low temperature con-
ditions (Fig. 2).
A meta-analysis forest plot was constructed for 34 ex-
periments to which the metan Stata procedure was ap-
plicable. The results showed a significant protective
effect against infection of both low and high dose expos-
ure to the insecticide (Fig. 3). The Mantel-Haenszel
pooled OR was 0.21 for the high dose versus control,
0.47 for the low dose versus control, and 0.27 overall
(see Fig. 3 for 95 % CIs). Heterogeneity tests showed a
uniform effect across all experiments as indicated by the
I2 statistic (0.0 % in all cases), which is a measure of the
variation of OR attributable to heterogeneity.
Mixed-effects logistic regression analysis, including the
data from all experiments using samples from the 42
volunteers, produced very similar estimates of the effect
of deltamethrin on infection rates (Table 2). Mosquitoes
exposed to the low and high doses had 59 and 80 %
lower risk of infection compared to those exposed to
untreated nets, and these differences were highly signifi-
cant (Table 2). This analysis also showed that the mean
ambient temperature
during
the
incubation period,
which varied between 24.8 and 26.8 °C, had an inde-
pendent and highly significant effect on risk of infection.
Gametocyte density, age of gametocyte donor, and
prior medication with antimalarial drugs had no statisti-
cally significant effects on oocyst infection prevalence
(gametocyte density data for one donor was considered
an outlier and was excluded from analysis).
Effect of deltamethrin on oocyst counts
Oocyst-positive mosquitoes exposed to both the low and
high dose deltamethrin had lower infection intensity
than positive mosquitoes exposed to untreated nets. The
median numbers of oocysts per infected mosquito in
each experiment were compared in the control and low-
dose groups, and in the control and high-dose groups,
using paired scattergrams (Fig. 4). The effect of the
insecticide on infection intensity was more pronounced
in the low-dose group.
Negative binomial regression of oocyst count of posi-
tive mosquitoes showed that exposure to deltamethrin,
mean ambient temperature during incubation period
and intake of antimalarials in the previous seven days
had statistically significant effects (Table 3). Compared
with the control group, the number of oocysts per posi-
tive mosquito was reduced by 41 and 34 % in the low
and high dose groups respectively.

 Discussion
This study showed that deltamethrin affects develop-
ment of P. falciparum in wild, kdr-L1014S resistant An.
gambiae s.s. in a malaria endemic setting. Exposure to
sub-lethal doses of the insecticide shortly after infective
feeding reduced both the oocyst prevalence and intensity
of infection inside the mosquito.
It is possible that the reduction could be produced by
either or both of two possible mechanisms: differential
insecticidal killing of infected mosquitoes (as might be
seen if infection restored phenotypic susceptibility in ge-
notypically resistant mosquitoes), and/or a direct effect
of the insecticide on the parasite inside the mosquito.
Previous laboratory studies have described effects of
different pyrethroids on Plasmodium sporogony. Delta-
methrin was shown to reduce P. yoelii yoelii infection
rates in An. stephensi [14, 16], whereas bioallethrin and
fenvalerate affected the parasites at the sporozoite level
only [15]. Hill carried out laboratory-based research on
the effects of sub-lethal doses of different insecticides on
malaria vectors [17]. His findings showed that exposure
of insecticide resistant An. stephensi to pyrethroids re-
sulted in significant inhibition of P. yoelii nigeriensis
and P. falciparum sporogonic development, whereas
no such effect was found with organochlorine, carba-
mate and organophosphate insecticides. Earlier studies
also reported that non-pyrethroid insecticides have no
effect on malaria infection in mosquitoes [18, 19].
However, exposure of resistant strains of An. gambiae
s.s. to bendiocarb and DDT has been shown to re-
duce P. falciparum prevalence [13].
Higher infection rates have been reported in kdr re-
sistant mosquitoes compared to susceptible ones al-
though results from different studies were conflicting
in terms of the effect on infection intensity at oocyst
and sporozoite stages [11, 12]. A recent study showed
that kdr resistant mosquitoes infected with P. falcip-
arum were less able to survive DDT exposure than un-
infected mosquitoes during the first seven days post
infection, but there was no significant difference in
mortality rates between sporozoite-infected and control
groups later on [13].
Although kdr allele was almost fixed in the An. gam-
biae s.s. population, the susceptibility test data showed
relatively high mortality (71.9 %). It is therefore likely
that resistance is mediated by a combination of meta-
bolic detoxification mechanisms and kdr, and that the
resistance phenotype (i.e. strength of expression of
resistance) differs between the mosquitoes. Metabolic re-
sistance is a potential confounder in the effect of the
insecticide on the parasite as it mediates the amount of
insecticide or insecticide metabolites to which the para-
site would be exposed. As mosquitoes become resistant
and receive sub-lethal doses and survive, the probability
of exposure of the parasites to these doses may increase.
On the other hand, as detoxification becomes more
powerful, most of the insecticide may be metabolised
which could mean less exposure of the parasite. Never-
theless,
insecticide
metabolites
or
other
resistance-
related factors could still affect the parasite’s develop-
ment directly or through their potential effect on the
mosquito’s immune system indirectly [25, 26]. Further
studies are needed to understand better the potential ef-
fects of resistance.
Insecticide dose, mean daily temperature, and medica-
tion were all significant variables in our models. The
doses of deltamethrin used in this study were much
lower than those on a standard long-lasting insecticidal
net (LLIN) (e.g. 55 mg/m2 in PermaNet® 2.0). Washing
and long-term use reduce deltamethrin content of ITNs

Fig. 3 Forest plot of the effects of high and low doses of deltamethrin on P. falciparum oocyst infection rates in kdr-L1014S resistant An. gambiae s.s. The
plot shows odds ratio (OR) obtained from meta-analysis of data corresponding to 34 experiments (using blood samples from 30 of the 42 volunteers). Only
experiments with sample sizes appropriate for the metan procedure calculation were included in the plot (12 experiments had multiple zeros in 2x2 tables
and therefore were excluded from the plot). Experiment numbers represent individual volunteers, except when a suffix is used to show more than one
experiment per volunteer. For each of the experiments, the OR and 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) were computed, with OR < 1 indicating lower
infection rate of deltamethrin-exposed mosquitoes compared to control. The size of each grey square represents the experiment’s weight and horizontal
line indicates 95 % CI. Summary (Mantel-Haenszel pooled) OR estimates for each dose and for all experiments are represented by open diamonds with
their lateral tips indicating 95 % confidence limits. The dotted line indicates the overall OR

 [24]. So, effects of the kind observed here would be
expected not only with new nets, but also older one-
s—although the effect seems to be dose-dependent, with
higher insecticide doses having a bigger impact espe-
cially on infection prevalence. However, the reduction of
the intensity of infection was more pronounced in the
low-dose group than the high-dose group. Some studies
have suggested that intensity and prevalence of infection
might be regulated by different mechanisms in the mos-
quito, probably in relation to different immune signalling
pathways [27, 28].
We showed that high ambient temperature independ-
ently reduced oocyst prevalence and intensity. Temperature
affects malaria transmission by affecting the life cycles of
both the vector and the parasite. Within the relevant
temperature range, sporogony is shorter at higher tempera-
tures [29]. However, higher temperatures have been shown
to reduce prevalence of oocyst infection [30], may be detri-
mental to parasite development [31], and can affect the
immune response of mosquitoes [32]. Temperature can
also change the effect of insecticides on a mosquito popula-
tion by modifying mortality rates [33].
Antimalarial medication reduced the intensity of oo-
cyst infections in our study. Six of the volunteers took
artemether-lumefantrine and two took quinine within
seven days before providing blood samples. These drugs,
especially the former, are known to have gametocytoci-
dal properties [34]. In the present study, gametocyte
density and age of the donor did not have a significant
effect. This could indicate that the insecticide’s effect is
probably not at the gametocyte stage.
This study may have implications on the continued use
of pyrethroid-based ITNs which have contributed to
substantial reduction of malaria mortality in the past
decade. As suggested in the study, if pyrethroids affect de-
velopment of the parasite inside the mosquito, prevention
tools dependent on these chemicals will continue to play a
major role in malaria control despite vector resistance.

 The effect of pyrethroids reported here could explain,
at least partly, why resistance has not always led to con-
trol failure and ITNs seem to remain effective in most
situations [6, 7, 35–37]. More research will be needed to
fully understand the mechanisms of interactions be-
tween the parasite, different insecticide resistance mech-
anisms and the insecticide in the mosquito vector, and
the roles of these interactions in modulating transmis-
sion in the field. Our study suggests that the continued
use of pyrethroid treated nets might be helping to
prevent failure of malaria control in Africa despite the
rapid evolution of insecticide resistance, and supports
the efforts to maintain the use of existing effective
interventions.
Conclusions
The use of nets treated with pyrethroid insecticides has
contributed to the prevention of millions of deaths due
to malaria, but resistance to these insecticides is spread-
ing rapidly in the vector mosquitoes in Africa. We inves-
tigated whether the chemicals could affect malaria
parasites inside resistant mosquitoes in an endemic area.
The study showed that, with locally-sampled P. falcip-
arum parasites and An. gambiae s.s., doses of pyre-
throids that are sub-lethal for resistant mosquitoes can
interfere with parasite development inside mosquitoes,
significantly reducing both the proportion of infected
mosquitoes and the intensity of infection. This mechan-
ism could enable pyrethroid-treated nets to prevent mal-
aria transmission despite increasing vector resistance.
