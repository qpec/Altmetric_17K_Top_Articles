Abstract
Multiple drug resistant (MDR) malignancy remains a predictable and often terminal event in
cancer therapy, and affects individuals with many cancer types, regardless of the stage at
which they were originally diagnosed or the interval from last treatment. Protein biomarkers
of MDR are not globally used for clinical decision-making, but include the overexpression of
drug-efflux pumps (ABC transporter family) such as MDR-1 and BCRP, as well as HIF1α, a
stress responsive transcription factor found elevated within many MDR tumors. Here, we
present the important in vitro discovery that the development of MDR (in breast cancer
cells) can be prevented, and that established MDR could be resensitized to therapy, by
adjunct treatment with metformin. Metformin is prescribed globally to improve insulin sensi-
tivity, including in those individuals with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM2). We demonstrate
the effectiveness of metformin in resensitizing MDR breast cancer cell lines to their original
treatment, and provide evidence that metformin may function through a mechanism involv-
ing post-translational histone modifications via an indirect histone deacetylase inhibitor
(HDACi) activity. We find that metformin, at low physiological concentrations, reduces the
expression of multiple classic protein markers of MDR in vitro and in preliminary in vivo mod-
els. Our demonstration that metformin can prevent MDR development and resensitize MDR
cells to chemotherapy in vitro, provides important medical relevance towards metformin’s
potential clinical use against MDR cancers.
Introduction
An understanding of how and why tumor cells develop multiple drug resistance (MDR) has
remained a significant question in cancer research, and its elucidation may identify future tar-
gets to prevent, or reverse, treatment resistance. For many common malignancies, the delayed
emergence of MDR following initial successful responses is a devastating event. Breast, colon,
lung and hematological cancers are common cancers that have high rates of acquired treatment

 resistance [1]. Minimally effective therapies, and poorly tolerated side effects from the necessary
rescue therapies raises the importance of understanding the underlying biology within this
patient population to overcome this important clinical development. Discovering non-toxic,
effective treatment options to overcome treatment resistance, or perhaps prevent MDR develop-
ment in the first place, is of great interest.
Resistance to therapies can be inherent at diagnosis, or acquired in subpopulations of silent
surviving cells that reappear years later after an initial apparently successful treatment regime
[2]. Resistance to one agent is frequently manifested as resistance to many, hence the term
“multiple drug resistance” or MDR. This was recognized many years ago, and is reflected in
our current chemotherapy cocktails that incorporate multiple therapeutic agents with unre-
lated modes of action to decrease the rate of new treatment resistance. Well-recognized molec-
ular mechanisms of resistance are known and have been recently reviewed [3]. At the
forefront is the ABC family of drug-efflux pumps whose over-activity has been consistently
associated with drug resistance. Despite being novel drug therapy targets, clinical trials using
ABC transporter inhibitors have been disappointing in part because of their toxicities [4], but
also because they are unlikely to account for all mechanisms of resistance that are present.
MDR appears to be a complex and multifactorial adaptation by cancer cells that enables sur-
vival of these cell population subsets, and it is clear that individual cancers appear to highjack
more than one mechanism, without a single overriding molecular target accountable for all.
Early diagnosis, screening and advances in combination therapy of breast cancer has
resulted in longer disease-free survival times and cure rates [5, 6]. Nonetheless, many of these
patients return years later with recrudescent tumors [2]. Providing hope for the identification
of nontoxic therapies and a means to prevent MDR development in this important population
of treatment resistant breast cancer survivors is our ultimate goal. To this end, we primarily
utilize breast cancer cell lines selected in vitro for treatment resistance as our fundamental
model of MDR (see Davies et al 2009 and 2014). Below we describe our investigations into the
potential utility of metformin as adjunct therapy in the treatment of established MDR and in
preventing the development of new treatment resistance. The oral insulin-sensitizing drug
metformin is a first line therapeutic in the management of Type 2 diabetes (DM2), and has
also been shown to have antiproliferative activity in vitro against multiple cancer cells lines [7,
8]. An early meta-analysis performed on DM2 patients taking metformin with cancer reported
a 31% reduction in the incidence of new cancers including pancreas, colorectal, breast and
lung [9]. Recent meta-analyses confirm that individuals with DM2 who also have lung, colo-
rectal and liver cancer derive significant survival benefits regarding clinical outcomes if also on
metformin [10–12]. Patients with breast cancer benefited from metformin treatment in terms
of all cause survival, but not in incidence [13]. To date, however, the molecular mechanisms
facilitating metformin’s antiproliferative impact remains unclear. It also remains untested
whether metformin pretreatment can provide a benefit to established MDR malignancy or
interfere with the development of acquired drug resistance.
To study the underlying pathways necessary for the antiproliferative effect of metformin, as
well as a direct test of the utility of metformin in preventing acquired drug resistance, we used
the widely studied MCF7 breast cancer cell line and selected them for Doxorubicin (DOX)
resistance. Our accelerated selection protocol occurs over ~2 weeks, generating cell popula-
tions that exhibits enhanced cell viability upon pulse exposure to normally toxic doses of the
selected drug, exhibits resistance to previously unexposed drug classes, and expresses high lev-
els of one or more of BCRP, MDR-1, or HIF1α [14]. The following details our studies testing
our hypothesis that metformin can potentially reverse and prevent MDR development, and
offer a means to elucidate molecular pathways impacted by metformin antiproliferative
activity.

 Materials and methods
Cell culture and methods
MCF7 and T47D ER+, and BT-20 and MDA-MB-231 ER- human breast cancer, and K562 leu-
kemia cells were obtained from commercial sources; the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC), USA. The chemicals Doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX; Pfizer), Tamoxifen (TAM;
Cayman Chemical), phenformin (Sigma), Trichostatin A (TSA; Sigma), estradiol (Cayman
Chemical), Apicidin (Sigma), and Troglitazone (TRG; Calbiochem) were acquired from the
indicated providers. All treatment compounds were reconstituted in dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO) except metformin (Sigma), which was reconstituted in molecular-grade water
(Hyclone). The HDACi assay and in vitro hypoxia experiments were conducted as previously
described [14]. MCF7 and K562 parental cells were selected for drug resistance according to
our published methods [14, 15].
Western blot analysis
Adherent MCF7 cells were scraped, and centrifuged with sterile PBS for collection and resus-
pended in RIPA buffer followed by pulse sonication. Westerns were performed as described
[14]. Antibodies against the following proteins were used, typically at 1:2000 dilution: MDR-1
(Sigma), BCRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; SCBt), HIF1α (Abcam), S6K total (SCBt),
S6KS411phos (SCBt), p53 (SCBt), p53S392phos (Abcam), TFPI1 (Abcam), AMPKα1/2 total
(SCBt), AMPKα1T183/2T172phos (Abcam), AKT total (SCBt), AKTS473phos (SCBt), PARP
(Sigma), ERα (SCBt), histone H3 total (Millipore), H3K9Ac (Millipore), H2B total (Abcam),
H4K12Ac (Abcam), NFκB (SCBt), NREL (SCBt), tubulin (Sigma), actin (Sigma), and GAPDH
(Millipore). Luminescence was captured on film (Kodak) with subsequent chemical develop-
ment. Collection and semiquantitation of Western blots densitometry was done using ImageJ
Version 1.51 from scans of the original film.
MTT and Thymidine incorporation and trypan blue assays of viability and
proliferation
MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) and a non-radioactive
thymidine analogue 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) kit were used to measure cell viability
and proliferation. For thymidine, the Click-IT kit (Life Technologies) labeled cells with EdU
for 24 hours. For trypan blue assays (TB), MCF7 cells were cultured to 70% confluency in
6-well multiwell tissue culture dishes and treated in triplicate with metformin at the dosages
indicated for 48 hours, trypsinized and centrifuged to pellet in microtubes. The pellet was
treated with 0.25% TB solution in PBS (Hyclone) and cell viability was assessed using a TC20
automated cell counter (Biorad).
RNA silencing
MCF7 cells were transfected with 1 μg of duplex human AMPKα1/2, NFκB or scrambled
siRNA according to the manufacturers’ instructions (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). 1 μg (80
pmol) of targeted siRNA was delivered to 50 μl of the cationic delivery agent Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX (Gibco) for 30 minutes at RT, then incubated for 72 hours followed by drug
treatments.

 Animals
Female NOD/SCID/common gamma-chain knock-out (NSG: NOD/PrkdcSCID/IL2RN-/-) 8 to
14 week-old mice (Jackson Laboratory, USA) were used, and fed ad libitum. All experiments
were approved by the University of Saskatchewan animal ethics office, in accord with the
guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care.
Murine xenograft experiments
K562 Doxorubicin-resistant cells (1 x 106 cells/mouse in 100 μL of PBS) were injected subcuta-
neously into the sacral region. Metformin (130 mg/kg) was administered by intraperitoneal (i.
p.) injection on alternating days, starting when tumors were ~25 mm3, as measured by calipers
every other day (~11 days after seeding tumor cells). Control mice received vehicle only
(200 μL PBS). At day 28, tumors were surgically excised and analyzed (n = 2 per treatment
arm). The 4–28 tumor was obtained from a patient with triple negative (TN) breast cancer
with written informed consent from the donor, and compliant with the Research Ethic board
approved protocol at the University of Saskatchewan. A fragment from the original tumor was
passaged 8 times in NSG mice; the resultant tumor was excised and ~2 mm fragments were
grafted subcutaneously into 4 separate NSG mice. On day 37 metformin was delivered to each
mouse as 0, 50, 100 or 200 mg/kg per i.p. injection. The mice were sacrificed after 72 hours of
receiving metformin, with tumors surgically removed and analyzed (n = 1 per treatment arm).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using One-Way ANOVA and Bonferroni correction with
Stata 13.0 software. Error bars define the standard error of the mean. Statistically significant
differences (p < 0.05) are noted within their respective figure legends.
Results
Metformin has antiproliferative potential against drug resistant cell
populations in vitro, and works additively with Doxorubicin
Our in vitro biological model of drug resistance made use of the well characterized and widely
utilized estrogen receptor positive (ERα+) MCF7 breast cancer cell line (parental), and its
paired cell line selected for Doxorubicin resistance (DOXRes), using our previously published
in vitro protocol [14, 15]. Cells selected against DOX using our protocol are considered MDR
due to resistance against unrelated drugs, including metformin [16] (Fig 1A). The dosing of
metformin in vitro is a contentious issue with concerns that supra-physiological doses result in
off-target effects and are not reflective of in vivo events. Our in vitro metformin dosing ranges
were from 0.1 mM to 5 mM; in comparison, the in vivo trough human serum levels of metfor-
min (average 1500 mg oral daily dose) has been reported at 2–6 μM [17], with peak levels of
38 μM and steady state ranges of 15.5 μM [18].
We measured the proliferation of treatment sensitive (MCF7 parental) versus resistant
(DOXRes) MCF7 cell populations following a 48-hour metformin exposure. Metformin
impaired growth in a dose-dependent manner in both populations of MCF7, but to a signifi-
cantly lesser degree in DOXRes cells (Fig 1A). To determine whether metformin could enhance
DOX cytotoxicity as combination therapy in MCF7 DOXRes cells, we treated MCF7 parental
and DOXRes cells with DOX (1 μM) and metformin (1 mM), individually and in combination.
The results show that there is an additive increase in killing when metformin is combined with
DOX in both sensitive and resistant cell populations (Fig 1B). Metformin activity was con-
firmed, as AMPKα1T183/2T172phos and AKTS473phos was relatively increased, and decreased,

 respectively, as expected [19, 20] (Fig 1C). Furthermore, the reduced proliferation observed
with metformin exposure was correlated with enhanced apoptosis (Fig 1C) (measured as poly
(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage), as has been previously reported [21, 22].
Metformin has enhanced antiproliferative potential in ERα+ cells and
decreases total ERα protein levels
The estrogen receptor α (ERα+) status of breast cancer cells is utilized as both a prognostic and
predictive marker of cancer outcomes; triple negative (TN) breast cancers lack the ERα, pro-
gesterone (PR) and HER2 receptors and are inherently more difficult to treat, whereas ERα+
tumors respond well to therapies and are uniquely suited to adjunct use of anti-estrogen ther-
apy [23]. We showed above that metformin had antiproliferative activity against ERα+ cells
(Fig 1), and we next investigated whether metformin had a similar, or different, impact on

 ERα+ versus ERα− cell lines. We exposed ERα+ (T47D and MCF7) and TN (BT-20 and
MD-MBA-231) breast cancer cells to metformin with cell proliferation measured by MTT
analyses (Fig 2A). The results show that metformin had antiproliferative potential regardless of
ERα status, but had a noticeably greater impact against ERα+ cells.
Malignancies of the breast can be hormone-responsive, including acting through estrogen
binding to ERα [24], with ER modulators such as tamoxifen typically used as adjuvant therapy
[25]. To determine whether metformins’ greater influence on ERα+ cells reflects modulation
of the ERα protein, we determined ERα total protein levels compared to untreated controls,
and noted that 5 mM metformin markedly reduced ERα abundance (Fig 2B). Western analy-
ses of AMPK phosphorylation confirmed the expected AMPK phosphorylation/activation

measured by MTT from two biological repeats. p < 0.001 for all cell lines comparing 0 mM to 5 mM metformin, n = 6 samples analysed. (B) Protein

Tamoxifen (TAM), for 48 hours and analyzed as described above for (A). Values normalized to control. n = 3 samples analyzed. * = p < 0.05.

 with metformin exposure (Fig 2B). Tamoxifen interferes with ERα function, and we asked
whether Tamoxifen and metformin have similar antiproliferative impacts on ERα. We found
that the combination of metformin in combination with Tamoxifen is more effective than
either compound alone in halting the growth of MCF7 parental cells (Fig 2C). Metformin
may, therefore, have additional functions that are independent of the ERα effects mediated by
Tamoxifen.
Metformin decreases the abundance of MDR markers in vitro
We previously reported that troglitazone (TRG), an insulin sensitizer of the thiazolidinedione
class used in the treatment of DM2 (metformin is an unrelated biguanide insulin sensitizer),
reduced the protein levels of the ABC transporter class of drug efflux pumps elevated in multi-
ple aggressive cancer cells (MDR-1 and BCRP in MCF7 DOXRes, and MDR-1 in K562 DOXRes
cells) [15]. Additional recent reports by others indicate that metformin may also possess this
ability in vitro [26, 27]. Considering that metformin reduced the abundance of ERα (Fig 2B),
and decreased the proliferation of MCF7 parental and DOXRes cells, we asked if metformin
could decrease the abundance of multiple markers of MDR as a means of explaining the
enhanced treatment sensitivity of MDR cells upon metformin treatment. We also asked if met-
formin had effects across drug-resistant cell populations of unrelated cancer types. We first
looked in vitro at our MCF7 cell line selected for resistance to DOX (Fig 3A). We directly com-
pared the relative protein abundance of MDR markers between parental and MCF7 DOXRes
cells across a wide concentration range of metformin. At baseline without metformin (Fig 3A,
compare 0 lanes), the DOXRes population displayed enhanced protein abundance of these
MDR protein markers compared to sensitive cell populations. In turn, there was a trend to
decrease the abundance of MDR-1, HIF1α, p53S392phos (versus total p53) and S6KS411phos (ver-
sus total S6K) in a dose-dependent manner that was much more prevalent in the MCF7
DOXRes cell population. We included an assessment of p53 phos S392 since p53phosS392 in MCF7
parental cells is a beneficial activating and stabilizing signal that acts to target cancer cells for
apoptosis [28], but in aggressive cancer cells, p53phos392 is often elevated, with this contributing
to tumor progression [29, 30].
We observed several marked differences in the abundance of MDR protein markers
between MCF7-sensitive and -resistant cell populations in response to metformin (Fig 3A).
First, in parental/sensitive cells, HIF1α protein levels were consistently increased by metfor-
min, even at the lowest concentration tested. Secondly, abundance of phospho-, but not total
p53 and S6K were enhanced in parental cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 3A, left panels).
Next, in resistant populations (MCF7 DOXRes), metformin reduced p53phos392 levels in a dose-
dependent manner, which was also observed for the protein levels of HIF1α, MDR-1 and
S6KS411pho (Fig 3A, right panels). Taken together, these results are consistent with metformin
activity being context dependent, with metformin playing distinct roles in treatment sensitive
versus resistant MCF7 cells.
Metformin exposure decreased HIF1α protein levels under normal oxygenation levels (Fig
3A). Hypoxia is a powerful inducer of HIF1α expression, just as the hypoxia present in the
intratumoral environment is considered a major driver of aggressive and treatment resistant
tumors [31, 32]. We queried whether metformin was capable of blocking the accumulation of
HIF1α under strong hypoxic induction conditions. We observed that hypoxia was sufficient to
markedly induce the expression of HIF1α protein (Fig 3B), but that metformin was the most
effective agent tested that blocked hypoxia-induced HIF1α protein abundance. Indeed, it was
more effective than a second biguanide, phenformin, in inhibiting HIF1α protein expression.
Unlike metformin however, phenformin is not in clinical use.

 Metformin dependent reversal of MDR-associated protein markers
occurs in vivo in breast and non-breast cancers
We next asked if metformin demonstrated similar efficacy in lowering MDR markers in an in
vivo model. In this preliminary study, we grew human tumors in mice from both leukemia cell
lines (K562) and patient-derived (PDX) breast cancer cells. Specifically, we injected severely
immunodeficient NOD-SCID-IL-2Rgamma-/- (NSG) mice with K562 human myelogenous
leukemia cells selected for DOXRes [16], but also xenografted tumor fragments obtained from
a patient-derived TN partially-resistant breast tumor (based on actual clinical response) into
NSG mice (4–28). Once tumors formed (~25 mm3; day 11 for K562 DOXRes cells, and day 37
for 4–28 tumor slices), metformin was administered by i.p. injection. NSG mice growing K562
DOXRes cells were injected on alternating days (days 11–28) and sacrificed on day 28, whereas
the 4–28 tumor-bearing mice were sacrificed 72 hours after a single metformin treatment. The
excised tumor tissue was assessed for changes in MDR-1 and TFPI1 protein abundance in
response to metformin exposure (we previously found TFPI1 involved in MDR development
[14]) (Fig 3C), as well as HIF1α protein abundance (Fig 3D).
Metformin monotherapy did not decrease the size, nor slow the growth of the K562
DOXRes tumors, as compared to the untreated control arm in vivo in this pilot test. Despite
this lack of clinical response, the MDR-1 and TFPI1 protein levels did noticeably decrease in
the metformin treated arms (Fig 3C). Metformin was physiologically active in the NSG mice,
based on the ready detection of AMPK phosphorylation in the metformin treatment arm (Fig
3C). In our metformin dose response pilot study using 4–28 human patient-derived tumor
fragments, HIF1α levels were reduced even at the lowest metformin concentration (50 mg/kg;
Fig 3D). The above results suggest that metformin reduces MDR markers both in vitro and in
vivo, in breast and non-breast cancers.
Metformin-dependent reversal of MDR markers in resistant cell
populations is AMPK-independent
We next investigated whether metformins’ antiproliferative activity is NFκB–or AMPK-
dependent, and tested this in both sensitive and resistant cell populations. A previous report
suggested that the metformin-dependent decline of MDR-1 protein levels in MDR cells is
mediated through inhibition of NFκB activity [26]. However, we observed that NFκB is
reduced in MCF7 DOXRes cells, and that metformin did not appreciably impact NFκB protein
levels in the parental cell population in a dose dependent manner (S1 Fig). Consistent with
this, we found that silencing NFκB did not impact metformin antiproliferative activity (S2 and
S3 Figs). We conclude that NFκB is not required for the antiproliferative activity of metformin
on treatment resistant MCF7 cells.
The metabolic beneficial activity of metformin in DM2 is believed to occur in part via the
phosphorylation and activation of AMPK [33]. Studies have shown that metformin facilitates
the phosphorylation of AMPK indirectly through the action of the upstream kinase LKB1
maintained in a 1% O2 hypoxia chamber for 24 hours. Cell lysates were prepared and analyzed using the antibodies shown, representative of
two consistent experimental repeats. (C) A preliminary study of 2 mice per treatment arm: NOD/SCID mice harboring palpable tumors derived
from K562 DOXRes cells were treated with metformin i.p. (130 mg/kg) or saline (considered Day 1). Tumors were excised after 28 days and
processed for Westerns using the antibodies shown. The same protein concentration of each lysates was used for all western analysis, with
tubulin representing a protein loading control for all. (D) A preliminary study of acute metformin effects on tumor markers in vivo: NOD/SCID
mice growing tumors derived from a human patient with triple negative breast cancer were treated with single specific doses of metformin by i.
p (0, 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight) as indicated. 72 hours later, the tumors were excised from each mouse, protein lysates were
prepared, equal protein amounts separated by SDS PAGE and assessed by Western analysis using the antibodies indicated. Actin represents
the protein loading control. PDX: patient-derived xenograft.

 [34,35]. In contrast to the known contribution of AMPK/LKB1 in metformin’s glucoregulatory
activities, it remains unclear how metformins’ antiproliferative activity is regulated, and is still
being debated [36–38]. A recent report indicated that metformin required AMPK, but not
LKB1, to halt the proliferation of human non-small cell lung cancer cells [37].
To test the AMPK-dependence of metformin-induced decreases in MDR-associated pro-
teins in breast cancer, we silenced AMPK in treatment sensitive and resistant MCF7 cell popu-
lations (Fig 4). As noted previously, there was an increase of MDR-1 and BCRP markers in the
treatment resistant cell population, in the absence of treatment (Fig 4B, lane 1 vs. 5). In the
resistant cell population, metformin tended to decrease both MDR-1 and BCRP protein levels
regardless of AMPK silencing (Fig 4B, Lane 5 & 6 vs. Lane 7 & 8). In contrast, metformin treat-
ment in parental MCF7 cells caused MDR-1 and BCRP levels to increase in controls cells
(scrambled siRNA; scr), which was partially reversed in AMPK-silenced cells (Fig 4B, left
panel). One interpretation of this is to suggest that in DOXRes cells, metformin acts in an
AMPK-independent manner. This suggests that MDR-1 and BCRP, as members of a stress
response system [39] are activated in the presence of metformin, and this appears to be
AMPK-dependent. This supports the possibility that metformin uses different cellular machin-
ery depending on sensitive versus drug resistant cell populations.
Metformin possesses indirect HDACi activity
We had previously observed that the non-biguanide insulin sensitizer Troglitazone (TRG), a
thiazolidinedione class of drugs used to treat DM2, increased histone posttranslational modifi-
cations (15, 16, 40),. We asked if metformin was also capable of modifying histones, given that
this modification may alter gene expression and explain in part the altered MDR-marker pro-
tein levels we have seen with metformin exposure. We performed Western analyses of histone
H3 Lys9 acetylation (H3K9Ac) in MCF7 cells with increasing durations of metformin, TRG
and a second biguanide, phenformin, and observed that a fixed dose of metformin tended to
increase H3K9Ac in a time dependent manner (Fig 5A) and that metformin and phenformin
both exhibited a comparable temporal induction of histone acetylation to that of TRG. Metfor-

 histone H2B remained unchanged with time and dose (Fig 5A and 5B). This may be due to an
underlying histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) activity.
Although from unrelated drug classes, we found the insulin sensitizers TRG and metformin
to induce global histone acetylation, and to exert cytotoxic effects on MCF7 cells. To determine
if they are acting through separate or similar pathways, we compared the cytotoxic effects of
the drugs when used alone or in combination. The results show that cell proliferation is most
greatly impaired when both metformin and TRG are used in combination (Fig 5C), supporting
the idea that separate pathways are utilized by TRG and metformin when it comes to inhibit-
ing cancer cell proliferation.
We had previously provided evidence that increased global histone acetylation in response
to TRG exposure was due to an inherent and direct HDACi activity [40]. This is highly rele-
vant, as HDACi’s possess antiproliferative activity in cancer cells and are presently in phase III
clinical trials [41,42]. To test whether the increases in histone acetylation noted here with met-
formin are also due to HDACi activity, we performed in vitro quantitative assays to measure
the deacetylation of an acetylated peptide, as done previously [40]. To test for the presence of
indirect histone deacetylation activity, we measured HDAC activity in whole cell lysates col-
lected after the cells were exposed to the classic HDACi Trichostatin A (TSA), as well as the
biguanides metformin and phenformin. The lysates were incubated with acetylated peptides
that fluoresce when deacetylated, allowing quantitative measurement. Compared to untreated
controls, all chemical agents significantly inhibited HDAC activity (Fig 5D). Since this could
occur via a cell signaling mechanism within whole cells (indirectly) and not by direct inhibi-
tion of HDAC enzymes, we repeated the assay in untreated cell lysates to determine if there is
indirect HDACi activity. TSA again blocked the deacetylation of the peptide, whereas metfor-
min and phenformin did not (Fig 5E). Together, these results are consistent with the biguanide
compounds, metformin and phenformin, indirectly inhibiting HDAC activity, rather than by
directly affecting HDAC enzymes.
The development of treatment resistant breast cancer can be prevented
by pretreatment with metformin in vitro
We asked whether the metformin-dependent reductions in MDR marker protein levels in
resistant populations could be adapted for use in the sensitive parental populations to prevent
the development of resistance to therapy. To test this, we used standard selection pressure in
MCF7 cells with, or without, the presence of metformin pretreatment to compare the resulting
cell population’s sensitivity to a sublethal dose of DOX. Specifically, the parental MCF7 cells
were pre-treated with a low concentration of metformin (100 μM) for 48 hours, which was
continued throughout the experiment, in the presence of DOX selection pressure. Cell lysates
were prepared from the treated and untreated cells every 24 hours and analyzed for MDR pro-
tein marker expression (Fig 6A). Metformin pretreatment delayed/decreased (HIF1α, MDR-1,
and BCRP) or prevented (TFPI1) the protein increases typically observed in DOXRes cells
(compare right side with left side in Fig 6A and 6B). These results demonstrate that pretreat-
ment of cells with low dose metformin effectively inhibits the expression of MDR-associated
proteins.
Of importance when considering future clinical implications of our findings, we next com-
pared the drug sensitivity between these cell populations selected for resistance while in the
presence of metformin. On days 5 and 10 during the DOX selection process, cells were
exposed to 1 μM DOX to test for resistance to this drug. The results demonstrate that metfor-
min pretreated cells retained DOX sensitivity as compared to those without metformin pre-
treatment at Day 5 and even greater differences at Day 10 (Fig 6C). There appears to be a

 correlation between the metformin-dependent decreases in MDR protein markers and main-
tenance of treatment sensitivity despite the strong drug selection protocol. However, in cells
without metformin pretreatment, by Day 10 there was no significant DOX treatment effect on
proliferation, suggesting that drug-resistance was developing over the experimental timeline.
Interestingly, even though markers of MDR were elevated on Day 5 (Fig 6A and 6B), the cells
remain drug sensitive, indicating that it may be possible to detect early development of MDR
prior to clinical relevance. This observation provides evidence that metformin, at a low and
potentially clinically relevant dose, has the capacity in vitro to block the development of drug
resistance, and that elevated MDR markers may precede drug resistance.
One cellular proliferation assay we utilized was the MTT assay [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-
2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] to measure the cytotoxic/static effect of metformin
exposure in drug resistant breast (MCF7) and leukemia (K562) cell lines. Yet we also utilized
two independent measures of proliferation, that of thymidine incorporation (TI) and trypan
blue exclusion, to directly compare the measurements obtained by MTT, as there is a theoreti-
cal risk that metformin may influence MTT results by falsely lowering the measure of prolifer-
ation due to mitochondrial effects. MTT is reduced to a purple formazan in living cells by
NAD(P)H-dependent oxidoreductase (NOX) enzymes [43]; NOX enzymes produce reactive
oxygen species (ROS) in the cytosol, which may be inhibited by metformin [44], thus falsely
lowering the purple chromophore indicating live cells, and therefore appear as an underesti-
mate of cell viability. In contrast, TI measures replicating DNA, and would not be similarly
affected by metformin. As shown in S4 Fig, the proliferation measured in the presence of 1
mM and 5 mM metformin is not significantly different between the two assays, supporting our
use of the MTT assay in the presence of these concentrations of metformin. Next, we used Try-
pan blue exclusion assays (S5 Fig); trypan blue is a dye that is excluded from living cells, pre-
sumably due to an intact and impermeable plasma membrane, and is considered a measure of
viability, not just proliferation [45]. S5 Fig indicates that the MTT assay on MCF7 cells treated
with increasing doses of metformin up to 5 mM does not underestimate cell viability/prolifera-
tion. Our comparison of both TI and trypan blue exclusion assays to those values obtained by
MTT assays indicated that metformin had no discernable impact on our proliferation assess-
ments, and that MTT assays can provide valid measures for these experiments.
Discussion
Adjunct metformin resensitizes established MDR to treatment in vitro
We have demonstrated that metformin monotherapy has an antiproliferative effect on multi-
ple cell lines, including those selected for resistance to Doxorubicin (DOX) (Fig 1 and Fig 2),
in a dose dependent manner (Fig 1A). This extends to multiple ERα+ and ERα- breast cancer
cell lines (Fig 2A). The effect is also observed when metformin is used in combination with
other anticancer treatments in breast cancer cells (Fig 1B and Fig 2C). Our findings are consis-
tent with the growing literature base demonstrating metformin’s ability to slow the growth of
tumor cells in vitro [46]. Furthermore, our results provide a rationale for the clinical use of
metformin in ERα- and more aggressive breast cancers, which are inherently more difficult to
treat [47].

 Metformin reverses the levels of MDR-associated protein markers
We have shown that metformin can reverse the expression of MDR markers in vitro and in
vivo (Fig 3 and Fig 4B), and this appears to be linked to the ability of metformin to render
DOXRes cells sensitive to DOX once again (Fig 1B). Metformin reduced the expression of
MDR markers in vitro and also in 2 separate pilot studies using in vivo mouse models of
aggressive tumors, one derived from a K562 human leukemia cell line selected for resistance to
DOX (Fig 3C), and one from a tumor obtained from a triple negative breast cancer patient
(Fig 3D). We observed that metformin acted on multiple cancer-promoting pathways in
DOXRes MCF7 cells by reducing the expression of at least two members of the ABC drug anti-
porters, MDR-1 and BCRP, reducing cancer-related phosphorylation of S6K on serine 473,
and p53 on serine 392 [29], and by reducing the expression of HIF1α (Fig 3A and 3D). We
previously reported that the anticoagulation cascade plays a role in MDR development: the
coagulation Factor Xa inhibitor Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor 1 α (TFPI1α) is strongly
upregulated in breast cancers in vitro and within patient samples upon MDR selection [14].
Metformin is also capable of reducing TFPI1α protein levels in a mouse model of treatment-
resistant human leukemia (K562 DOXRes) (Fig 3C). Thus, metformin is capable of inhibiting
multiple cancer promoting pathways in cells.
While DOX is commonly used as a chemotherapy agent to treat many cancers, it has limita-
tions as it induces cardiomyopathy, resulting from mitochondrial dysfunction and the genera-
tion of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [48]. DOX inhibits mitochondrial complex I activity,
leading to reduced ATP generation and loss of membrane potential. This results in release of
cytochrome c from mitochondria, followed by the activation of caspase 3, DNA fragmentation
and finally, apoptosis. The effects of metformin on MDR cells, according to our studies (reduc-
tion of drug efflux pumps), potentially creates a situation where DOX may no longer be
actively pumped out of the cell, allowing DOX to have a more potent effect once again.
Opposed to this interaction, metformin has been found to relieve DOX induced cardiomyopa-
thy in cardiomyocytes when cells were pretreated with metformin prior to DOX addition [48].
Metformin is an energy disrupter that also targets and inhibits complex I within the mitochon-
drial inner membrane [49]. Thus, it seems unlikely that metformin would rescue mitochon-
drial dysfunction in DOX treated cells (which also inhibits complex I). However, recent
studies indicate that metformin also induces ER stress that causes the release of calcium from
the ER that is taken up by mitochondria, leading to mitochondrial swelling and mitochondrial
biogenesis [50]. This was proposed to explain why metformin has weak apoptotic ability in
cancer cells, but also provides a likely explanation for how metformin could rescue mitochon-
drial defects in DOX treated cardiomyocytes.
Metformin has been described as impacting a broad array of molecular mechanisms, and
may influence different mechanisms depending on the chemotherapeutic drug it is combined
with [51,52]. Metformins’ ability to “poison” mitochondria was also shown to be relevant to
reversing resistance to Tamoxifen in MCF7 cells. It was concluded that mitochondrial activity
was crucial to the development of Tamoxifen resistance, and use of metformin to block mito-
chondrial function was enough to reverse the resistant phenotype [53]. Others have likewise
shown that metformin also has an anti-cancer effect on Tamoxifen resistant cells in vitro, and
that this occurs in ER positive cells [54,55]. This is consistent with our observations that met-
formin has an increased toxic effect on ER+ cells compared to ER- cells, that metformin
reduces ER expression, and that metformin works synergistically with Tamoxifen (Fig 2C)
Metformins’ ability to reduce the expression of markers of aggressive cancer was not limited
to drug resistant cell populations, as metformin also prevented the expression of HIF1α follow-
ing exposure to hypoxia (Fig 3B). We did not investigate whether this was through a decrease

 in HIF1α transcription versus through enhanced degradation [56], although HIF1α transcrip-
tion is normally constitutive regardless of oxygen abundance, whereas multiple post-transla-
tional modifications impact HIF1α protein stability in response to oxygen levels [57]. The
observed effect of metformin on HIF1α is important, as many tumor microenvironments are
hypoxic, providing the stimulus for HIF1α protein stabilization, which is associated with
increased angiogenesis and cell survival [58–60]. Consistent with this, we previously reported
that cells that survive hypoxia are resistant to a subsequent exposure to DOX [14]. It is clear in
the literature that hypoxia plays a vital role in the development of drug resistance [61–63], thus
the ability of metformin to block the expression the HIF1α protein upon hypoxic induction is
highly relevant to its ability to prevent/reverse drug resistance.
As a means of understanding the mechanism involved in blocking HIF1α gene expression
under hypoxic conditions, we found that Trichostatin A (TSA), a direct HDACi with potent
antiproliferative activity, did not diminish HIF1α protein levels following hypoxia, in contrast
to the decreases observed with metformin exposure (Fig 3B). We had shown that TRG reduced
the accumulation of MDR-1 and BCRP in MCF7 DOXRes cells, similar to metformin, but had
not included HIF1α in those studies [15]. A previous report suggested that TRG might in fact
induce HIF1α mRNA and protein levels [64] so it remains unclear why metformin and TRG
differ in this HIF1α hypoxic effect. Both metformin and TRG are insulin sensitizers and both
inhibit HDAC activity (Fig 5D and 5E; [40]). However, TRG appears to have direct HDACi
activities, possibly by binding HDAC enzymes, whereas metformin seems to have an indirect
HDACi effect, likely by interfering with signaling pathways that activate HDAC activity. Thus,
it appears that the hypoxic inhibition of HIF1α by metformin may be independent of its
HDACi activity.
Metformin acts independently of AMPK and NFκB in MDR cells
Metformin facilitates optimal glucose control in Type 2 diabetes (DM2) at least in part by tar-
geting AMPK for activation [35], which in turn affects key players in catabolic metabolism and
glucose uptake pathways [65]. However, we show that metformins’ action within drug-resis-
tant cell populations can occur in an AMPK-independent way, as MDR-1 and BCRP protein
levels were still reduced by metformin following AMPK silencing (Fig 4). It has also been sug-
gested that the antiproliferative ability attributed to metformin exposure lies in its ability to
downregulate NFκB activity, in an AMPK-dependent manner [26]. We found that NFκB pro-
tein levels were dramatically reduced in MCF7 DOXRes cells, compared to MCF7 parental
cells, where metformin had little effect on NFκB protein expression (S1 Fig). Furthermore,
silencing NFκB mRNA expression in MCF7 parental cells had little effect on metformin cyto-
toxicity (S2 Fig and S3 Fig). Thus, neither AMPK nor NFκB appear required for metformin
action, in this cell line, and under these conditions.
Metformin exhibits multiple anticancer activities
The observed decreases in ABC transporters, HIF1α, and TFPIα protein levels, and the
enhanced phosphorylation of S6KS473 and p53S392 clearly define a variety of potential pathways
that metformin may influence in order to control cancer cell proliferation. However, the
underlying mechanisms clearly remain elusive and involve AMPK-dependent and AMPK-
independent mechanisms [66]. We reported previously that the chemically unrelated thiazoli-
dinedione class (TRG) of insulin sensitizers induced increased histone acetylation via direct
HDACi activity [40]. TRG also decreased the phosphorylation of S6K and AKT, similar to that
observed with metformin (Fig 1D and Fig 3A; [40]). Similar to TRG, metformin induced a
dose-dependent increase in histone acetylation (Fig 5A and 5B), yet this appears to be an

 indirect effect (Fig 5E) that is consistent within the biguanide class of drugs, as phenformin
acted similarly in this assay (Fig 5D and 5E). A direct HDACi activity suggests that the drug
can directly bind to an HDAC enzyme and block its function, whereas an indirect activity indi-
cates that a signaling pathway is activated that in turn may block HDAC activity. There is a
possible explanation for the indirect metformin HDACi effect, as metformin has been shown
to cause the LKB1- and AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of class IIa HDACs (HDAC4, 5
and 7), which leads to their nuclear export and loss of targeted activity [67].
Histone acetylation is an important determinant of gene expression, with increases associ-
ated with elevated transcription, whereas deacetylated histones are often associated with gene
repression [68]. HDACi’s are potent killers of cancer cells [69], and several HDACi-based can-
cer therapeutic strategies are currently in clinical trials [70]. We found that metformin likely
acts through a different mechanism than TRG since treatment of MCF7 cells with both TRG
and metformin caused greater killing than either drug alone (Fig 5C). This synergy was also
noted with the combination of metformin and the classic HDACi, TSA [71]. Future work will
require establishing the role of metformin in the repression, rather than the expression, of
genes and protein modifications critical for MDR development. Metformin may therefore
have a clinical niche and usefulness because of its minimal side effect profile, low cost, oral
delivery and few contraindications.
Metformin pretreatment prevents acquired MDR development
The primary goals of this study were to determine whether metformin could reverse and/or
prevent MDR. We have established that metformin has the potential to reverse both the MDR-
related protein markers and treatment resistance associated with MDR. Next, we asked
whether metformin could prevent the onset of MDR, an investigation that would be very diffi-
cult using clinical trials, considering the years between initial treatment response and delayed
recrudescence. In addition, MDR cannot be detected in most clinical cases until response fail-
ure is apparent. Here, we adapted our in vitro selection protocol by first pretreating cells with
metformin, with a continued presence of metformin during the selection process. By analogy,
the daily long-term use of metformin in DM2 has been correlated with the primary prevention
of multiple cancer types [72] and improved outcomes when malignancies are present [10–12].
Using low doses of metformin before, and during, the selection process for treatment-resistant
cell populations, we observed that this prevented or delayed the accumulation of multiple
MDR markers (MDR-1, BCRP and TFPI1), reduced the expression of HIF1α (Fig 6A), and
retained a high degree of drug sensitivity. In contrast, rapid accumulation of MDR-protein
markers and drug resistance was detected in the absence of metformin pretreatment (Fig 6A–
6C). The correlation between lowered protein levels and decreased resistance supports the
potential use of these proteins as biomarkers. Future work will extend these timelines to that of
established resistant states (after months of selection) to determine if these proteins are tran-
siently or permanently suppressed. Lastly, this may be the first indication of a clinical role for
metformin in the long-term management of cancer, where individuals may be maintained on
oral metformin to extend remission times, or prevent drug resistance from developing.
