Meta-analyses on coffee and cancer incidence mainly restricted to limited cancers. We carried out 
a more comprehensive meta-analysis of cohort studies to explore association between coffee and 
most cancer types. We conducted comprehensive search and summarized relative risk (RR) and 
95% confidence intervals for the highest versus lowest coffee intake and cancer using STATA12. 
We conducted dose-analysis if result suggested significant association. The publication bias was 
evaluated with begg’s and egger’s test. Finally, 105 individual prospective studies were included. 
Inverse associations were observed on oral, pharyngeal, colon, liver, prostate, endometrial cancer 
and melanoma, with RR 0.69 (95% CI = 0.48–0.99, I2 = 73.4%, P = 0.044), 0.87 (95% CI = 0.78–0.96, 
I2 = 28.4%, P = 0.007), 0.46 (95% CI = 0.37–0.57, I2 = 0%, P = 0), 0.89 (95% CI = 0.84–0.93, I2 = 30.3%, 
P = 0.003), 0.73 (95% CI = 0.67–0.80, I2  = 0%, P = 0) and 0.89 (95% CI = 0.80–0.99, I2  = 0%, P = 0.031) 
respectively. However, the relative risk for lung cancer is 2.18 (95% CI = 1.26–3.75, I2  = 63.3%, 
P = 0.005). The summary relative risk for increment of 2 cups of coffee were RR = 0.73, 95% 
CI = 0.67–0.79 for liver cancer, RR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.96–0.98 for prostate cancer and RR = 0.88, 95% 
CI = 0.85–0.92 for endometrial cancer. Accordingly, coffee intake was associated with reduced risk of 
oral, pharynx, liver, colon, prostate, endometrial cancer and melanoma and increased lung cancer risk.
Cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In 20121,2, there were 14.1 million new cancer 
cases and 8.2 million cancer deaths globally and the global burden from cancer has become significantly high. 
Although the strategy for cancer treatment has improved much, cancer is still the most difficult disease to over-
come. Early diagnosis and treatment may provide good chance for cancer patients to improve overall prognosis. 
However, there is no promising survival for those who suffer from advanced cancer. Therefore, it is important to 
determine methods to prevent tumor occurrence. Nutrition, such as the consumption of citrus fruits, vegetables, 
and coffee, has also been considered to play an important role in reducing cancer risk3–5.
Coffee is one of the most popular beverages worldwide, and it has been speculated to decrease the risk of many 
types of cancers. Coffee is a complex mixture of many biologically active components, some of which may have 
anti-tumor effects. They include caffeine, cafestol, kahweol, and chlorogenic acid. Although many standardized 
meta-analyses5–18 between coffee intake and various cancers have been conducted, most of analyses restricted to 
limited types of cancers. In addition, there is no relevant meta-analysis to explore relationships between coffee 
intake and some types of cancer including melanoma and lymphoma. Furthermore, dose-response meta-analyses 
were only performed for liver cancer and prostate cancer19,20, we endeavor to conduct such analysis for cancer 
as many as possible. Besides, most meta-analyses included prospective studies and case-control studies, which 
may lead to the unconvincing results and conclusions. However, we included prospective studies into our study. 
In order to present the relatively obvious associations between coffee intake and the incidence of most of cancer 
types, we carried out a more comprehensive systematic updated meta-analysis of cohort studies to explore the

association between coffee consumption and most types of cancers. We try to provide a landscape of coffee and 
cancer incidence.
Methods
Search strategy. 
We conducted a computerized search of the literature on coffee and cancer from inception 
to July 2015. The search terms were (cancer OR tumor OR carcinoma) AND (coffee OR caffeine OR beverages 
OR diet OR drinking). Three major electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library) were 
used to search the relevant literature without language restriction. Then, we classified these studies into different 
groups according to cancer type and conducted repeated searches. Finally, we obtained a relatively complete liter-
ature record for every type of cancer. Moreover, we reviewed the references from retrieved articles for additional 
studies (Fig. 1).
Study selection. 
The included studies had to be prospective cohort, case-cohort, or nested case control 
studies and had to contain the association between coffee intake and cancer incidence. Case control studies and 
cross-sectional studies were excluded. Studies concerning the coffee intake and the mortality of cancer were also 
excluded. We also excluded the analysis about cancer if there was no enough to conduct meta-analysis or no 
updated prospective studies for previous meta-analysis. Each study had to provide estimates of hazard ratio (HR) 
or relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals or numbers of cases and controls to calculate those values. 
For cancers for which a dose-response analysis could be conducted, the quantitative measure of intake and the 
total number of cases and person years or relative information to calculate them were necessary. Two independ-
ent reviewers evaluated the eligibility of every study in a standardized manner. We resolved disagreements by 
consensus.
Data abstraction. 
We extracted data from each study. These data included the first author’s name, year of 
publication, country of origin, number of cases and participants, sex, age, types of cancer, duration of follow-up 
and comparison of exposure level and adjusted confounding variables. The relative risks or hazard ratio and 95% 
confidence intervals for the highest versus the lowest intake were also extracted.

Statistical analysis. 
We summarized the overall relative risk and 95% confidence intervals for the high-
est versus lowest intake of coffee and various cancers using the fixed or random effects models of STATA12 
(StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). The command is metan logrr loglci loguci, eform label(namevar = study) 
fixed/random xlabel(), effect(RR). Metareg logrr study, wsse(se). The fixed and random effects models were con-
ducted when there were no or low heterogeneity and medium or high heterogeneity, respectively. For studies that 
reported results by cancer type or sex, we combined them using fixed effects models. For studies that provided no 
relative risks and 95% confidence intervals, we calculated these values based on the number of cases and controls.
We conducted dose-response analyses for coffee and some types of cancers rather than all tumor types. When 
the summary RR indicates a significant association between coffee intake and cancer risk, we would conduct 
dose-response analysis for these types of cancers. Furthermore, the included studies for dose-response analysis 
had to be three at least. According to a previously described method21,22, information was required, such as the 
distribution of cases and person-years, variance of exposure levels and relative risks for at least three quantitative 
categories. The number of person-years was approximated from follow-up duration and number of subjects if 
the studies did not provide these values. We assigned the mid-point of the corresponding range of coffee intake 
as the exposure value in each category. When the highest category was open-ended, we assumed the width of the 
interval to be the same as the adjacent interval. When the lowest category was open-ended, we assigned zero as 
the lower boundary22. If coffee intake was reported as weeks or months instead of days, we computed the corre-
sponding days. If coffee intake was not measured in cups, we used 150 ml23 as a cup to recalculate the intakes to a 
common scale. We present the dose-response results for a two-cup daily increment of coffee consumption. Using 
restricted cubic splines with four knots at percentiles 5%, 35%, 65% and 95% of the distribution; we evaluated the 
curve linear relation between coffee intake and risks of liver cancer, prostate cancer and endometrial cancer. The 
P value was calculated to test the null hypothesis that the coefficients of the second and third splines are equal to 
zero24,25. According to the result, we conducted linear or non-linear dose-response analysis.
We used the I2 value to evaluate if heterogeneity could be explained by study differences rather than by 
chance26. I2-values of approximately 25%, 50%, and 75% indicate low, moderate and high heterogeneity. We did 
not use scores to assess the quality of the studies. Instead, we conducted subgroup analyses to evaluate the impact 
on overall RRs by cancer type, sex, follow-up period and some adjusted confounders, such as alcohol and BMI. 
Moreover, when the number of included studies was more than 10 and a substantial heterogeneity was observed, 
we would conduct subgroup analysis and meta-regression analysis to explore the potential source of heteroge-
neity. Furthermore, when the number of included studies was more than 10 and a substantial heterogeneity was 
observed, we would conduct subgroup analysis and meta-regression analysis to explore the potential source of 
heterogeneity.
We evaluated publication bias using Begg’s27 and Egger’s28 tests, with obvious publication bias suspected when 
P < 
 0.10. And we conducted a Trim and fill analysis29 to assess the stability of overall relative risk when the results 
suggested obvious publication bias. We conducted all of the statistical analyses using Stata Statistical Software, 
version 12.0.
Results
Digestive system cancer. Oral, pharynx cancer. Highest versus lowest intake. Six cohort studies30–35 
were included in the analysis (1395309 samples) of the highest versus lowest intake of coffee and oral, phar-
ynx cancer. The study characteristics are presented (Stable 1a). The summary RR was 0.69 (95% CI = 
 0.48–0.99, 
P = 0.044) with high heterogeneity (I2 = 73.4%, P = 0.002) (Fig. 2A). The results suggest no publication bias, with 
P = 
 1 for Begg’s test and P = 
 0.98 for Egger’s test. The subgroup analysis indicated that the inverse association was 
observed between coffee consumption and oral, pharynx cancer incidence in Asia and follow-up (> 
10 years) 
subgroup. The same relationship was observed in smoking adjustment subgroup, physical activity adjustment 
subgroup and total energy adjustment subgroup (Stable 1b).
Esophageal cancer. Highest versus lowest intake. Six cohort studies30,32–34,36,37 were included in the analysis 
(1395309 samples) of the highest versus lowest intake of coffee and esophageal cancer. The study characteris-
tics are presented (Stable 1a). The summary RR was 0.86 (95% CI = 
 0.71–1.04, P = 
 0.124) with no heterogeneity 
(I2 = 
 0%, P = 
 0.64) (Fig. 3A). The results suggest no publication bias, with P = 
 1 for Begg’s test and P = 
 0.69 for 
Egger’s test. The subgroup analysis suggested that no significant association was observed between coffee intake 
and esophageal cancer incidence in each subgroup (Stable 1b).
Stomach cancer. Highest versus lowest intake. Twelve cohort studies30,31,33,38–46 were included in the analysis 
(1305447 samples) of the highest versus lowest intake of coffee and stomach cancer. The study characteristics are 
presented (Stable 1a). The summary RR was 1.15 (95% CI = 
 0.96–1.37, P = 
 0.121) with medium heterogeneity 
(I2 = 
 49.2%, P = 
 0.027) (Fig. 3B). The results suggest no publication bias, with P = 
 0.63 for Begg’s test and P = 
 0.85 
for Egger’s test. The subgroup analysis indicated that coffee intake was associated with increased stomach cancer 
in USA and Asia. The same relationship was also observed in small number cases subgroup (< 
500 cases) and 
short follow-up subgroup (< 
10 years). The meta-regression analysis found no obvious to explain source of het-
erogeneity (Stable 1b).
Colorectal cancer. Highest versus lowest intake. Twenty-one cohort studies30,31,38,43,47–63 were included in 
the analysis (2141185 samples) of the highest versus lowest intake of coffee and colorectal cancer. The study 
characteristics are presented (Stable 1a). The summary RR was 0.96 (95% CI = 
 0.91–1.02, P = 
 0.175) with low 
heterogeneity (I2 = 
 23.6%, P = 
 0.160) (Fig. 4A). The summary RRs for colon and rectal cancer were 0.87 (95% 
CI = 0.78–0.96, P = 0.007) and 0.94 (95% CI = 0.85–1.04, P = 0.236) (Fig. 2B). The results suggest no publication

bias, with P = 0.70 for Begg’s test and P = 0.82 for Egger’s test. The subgroup analysis indicated that no significant 
association was observed between coffee intake and the risk of colorectal cancer in each subgroup. No substantial 
source of heterogeneity was found by meta-regression analysis (Stable 1b).
Pancreatic cancer. Highest versus lowest intake. Fifteen cohort studies30,31,38,44,64–74 were included in the analy-
sis (1219019 samples) of the highest versus lowest intake of coffee and pancreatic cancer. The study characteristics 
are presented (Stable 1a). The summary RR was 1.02 (95% CI = 
 0.87–1.18, P = 
 0.832) with low heterogeneity 
(I2 = 16.2%, P = 0.27) (Fig. 4B). The results suggest no publication bias, with P = 0.43 for Begg’s test and P = 0.75 
for Egger’s test. There was no significant association between coffee intake and the risk of pancreatic cancer in 
each subgroup through subgroup analysis. Meta-regression analysis found no factors explaining the source of 
heterogeneity (Stable 1b).

Liver cancer. Highest versus lowest intake. Nine cohort studies23,75–82 were included in the analysis (968517 
samples) of the highest versus lowest intake of coffee and liver cancer. The study characteristics are presented 
(Stable 1a). The summary RR was 0.46 (95% CI = 
 0.37–0.57, P = 
 0) with no heterogeneity (I2 = 
 0%, P = 
 0.44) 
(Fig. 5A). The results suggest no publication bias, with P = 
 0.18 for Begg’s test and P = 
 0.23 for Egger’s test. The 
inverse association was observed between coffee consumption and liver cancer incidence in most subgroups 
through subgroup analysis. However, there was no significant relationship between coffee intake and the risk of 
liver cancer in women subgroup (Stable 1b).
Dose-response analysis. We included seven studies23,75–80,82 for the dose-response analysis. There was no 
non-linear association between coffee intake and risk of liver cancer (P = 
 0.41 for non-linearity, Fig. 5A). A sta-
tistically significant inverse association was observed for liver cancer (RR = 
 0.73, 95% CI = 
 0.67–0.79) with an 
increased intake of 2 cups of coffee per day.
Tumors of the urinary system. 
Renal cancer. 
Highest versus lowest intake. 
Five cohort stud-
ies30,31,43,83,84 were included in the analysis (1036465 samples) of the highest group (samples/cases: 125065/144) 
versus lowest group (samples/cases: 232706/299) of coffee intake and renal cancer. The study characteristics are 
presented (Stable 2a). The summary RR was 0.79 (95% CI = 
 0.54–1.15, P = 
 0.226) with medium heterogeneity 
(I2 = 49.8%, P = 0.09) (Fig. 6A). The results suggest no publication bias, with P = 0.22 for Begg’s test and P = 0.14 
for Egger’s test. There was no significant association between coffee intake and renal cancer risk in each subgroup 
through subgroup analysis (Stable 2b). We did not found factors to explain the source of heterogeneity through 
subgroup analysis.
Bladder cancer. Highest versus lowest intake. Ten cohort studies30,31,38,85–91 were included in the analysis 
(340544 samples) of the highest versus lowest intake of coffee and bladder cancer. The study characteristics are 
presented (Stable 2a). The summary RR was 1.12 (95% CI = 
 0.94–1.34, P = 
 0.192) with medium heterogeneity 
(I2 = 
 39.6%, P = 
 0.094) (Fig. 6B). The results suggest publication bias, with P = 
 0.016 for Begg’s test and P = 
 0.01 
for Egger’s test. The summary RR was 1.04 (95% CI = 
 0.88–1.23, P = 
 0.669) after Trim and fill analysis. The sub-
group analysis indicated that coffee intake was associated with increased bladder cancer in USA (Stable 2b). 
No factor could explain the source of heterogeneity through subgroup analysis and meta-regression analysis 
 
(Stable 2b).
Prostate cancer. Highest versus lowest intake. Fourteen cohort studies30,31,38,43,92–101 were included in the anal-
ysis (864012 samples) of the highest versus lowest intake of coffee and prostate cancer. The study characteristics 
are presented (Stable 2a). The summary RR was 0.89 (95% CI = 
 0.84–0.93, P = 
 0.003) with medium heterogeneity 
(I2 = 30.3%, P = 0.14) (Fig. 5B). The results suggest no publication bias, with P = 0.83 for Begg’s test and P = 0.84 
for Egger’s test. Through subgroup analysis, we found the inverse association between coffee intake and prostate 
cancer incidence in most subgroups. However, there was no significant relationship between coffee intake and 
the risk of prostate cancer in Canada and Asia (Stable 2b). The same associations were observed in follow-up 
 
(< 
10 years) subgroup and some adjustment confounders including no physical activity adjustment subgroup and 
no BMI adjustment subgroup (Stable 2b). Meta-regression found no substantial factor to explain the source of 
heterogeneity.
Dose-response analysis. We included ten studies30,31,92,94,96–101 in the dose-response analysis. There was no 
non-linear association between coffee intake and risk of prostate cancer (P = 
 0.15 for non-linearity, Fig. 5B). A 
statistically significant inverse association was observed for prostate cancer (RR = 
 0.97, 95% CI = 
 0.96–0.98) with 
an increased intake of 2 cups of coffee per day.

Female genital system neoplasm. Breast cancer. Highest versus lowest intake. Seventeen cohort stud-
ies30,31,43,102–115 were included in the analysis (997482 samples) of the highest versus lowest intake of coffee and 
breast cancer. The study characteristics are presented (Stable 3a). The summary RR was 0.99 (95% CI = 
 0.94–1.04, 
P = 
 0.619) with no heterogeneity (I2 = 
 0%, P = 
 0.55) (Fig. 7A). The results suggest no publication bias, with 
P = 
 0.84 for Begg’s test and P = 
 0.75 for Egger’s test. No significant relationship was observed between coffee con-
sumption and the risk of breast cancer in all subgroups through subgroup analysis (Stable 3b).
Ovarian cancer. Highest versus lowest intake. Nine cohort studies9,31,43,116–121 were included in the analysis 
 
(687017 samples) of the highest versus lowest intake of coffee and ovarian cancer. The study characteristics 
are presented (Stable 3a). The summary RR was 1.04 (95% CI = 
 0.90–1.20, P = 
 0.582) with low heterogeneity 
(I2 = 
 23.7%, P = 
 0.23) (Fig. 7B). The results suggest publication bias, with P = 
 0.02 for Begg’s test and P = 
 0.009 for 
Egger’s test. The summary RR was 0.96 (95% CI = 
 0.84–1.09) after Trim and fill analysis. The subgroup analysis 
indicated that there was no significant association between coffee intake and ovarian cancer risk in each sub-
group. No factor could explain the source of heterogeneity through subgroup analysis (Stable 3b).
Endometrial cancer. Highest versus lowest intake. Twelve cohort studies30,31,43,122–130 were included in the anal-
ysis (1114002 samples) of the highest versus lowest intake of coffee and endometrial cancer. The study charac-
teristics are presented (Stable 3a). The summary RR was 0.73 (95% CI = 
 0.67–0.80, P = 
 0) with no heterogeneity 
(I2 = 0%, P = 
 0.58) (Fig. 5C). The results suggest no publication bias, with P = 0.19 for Begg’s test and P = 0.16 for 
Egger’s test. Subgroup analysis indicated that inverse significant association was observed between coffee con-
sumption and endometrial cancer incidence in most subgroups. However, there was no significant relationship 
between coffee intake and the risk of endometrial cancer in no BMI adjustment subgroup (Stable 3b).
Dose-response analysis. We included eleven studies30,31,43,122–129 for the dose-response analysis. There was no 
non-linear association between coffee intake and risk of endometrial cancer (P = 
 0.69 for non-linearity, Fig. 5C). A 
statistically significant inverse association was observed for endometrial cancer (RR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.85–0.92) 
with an increased intake of 2 cups of coffee per day.
Other cancers. 
Lung cancer. Highest versus lowest intake. Four cohort studies30,31,38,131 were included in 
the analysis (103137 samples) of the highest versus lowest intake of coffee and lung cancer. The study characteris-
tics are presented (Stable 4a). The summary RR was 2.18 (95% CI = 
 1.26–3.75, P = 
 0.005) with high heterogeneity 
(I2 = 63.3%, P = 0.04) (Fig. 2C). The results suggest no publication bias, with P = 0.73 for Begg’s test and P = 0.39 
for Egger’s test.
Melanoma. Highest versus lowest intake. Six cohort studies30,31,43,132–134 were included in the analysis (773536 
samples) of the highest versus lowest intake of coffee and melanoma. The study characteristics are presented 
(Stable 4a). The summary RR was 0.89 (95% CI = 0.80–0.99, P = 0.031) with no heterogeneity (I2 = 0%, P = 0.42) 
(Fig. 2D). The results suggest no publication bias, with P = 0.71 for Begg’s test and P = 0.40 for Egger’s test. There 
was no significant association between coffee intake and melanoma risk through subgroup analysis. The subgroup 
analysis indicated no factor to explain the source of heterogeneity (Stable 4b).
Lymphoma. Highest versus lowest intake. Three cohort studies30,31,43 were included in the analysis (89897 
samples) of the highest group (samples/cases: 32783/63) versus lowest group (samples/cases: 17229/22) cof-
fee intake and lymphoma. The study characteristics are presented (Stable 4a). The summary RR was 1.23 
 
(95% CI = 0.75–2.03, P = 0.415) with no heterogeneity (I2 = 0%, P = 0.769) (Fig. 8). The results suggest no publi-
cation bias, with P = 1 for Begg’s test and P = 0.18 for Egger’s test.

Subgroup, sensitivity, and meta-regression analyses. We conducted subgroup analyses and meta-regression 
analyses based on sex, duration of follow-up, geographical location and adjusted confounders. Coffee intake was 
associated with a decreased risk of liver cancer in most subgroups, with no substantial heterogeneity between 
subgroups. However, the protective effect was absent in the female population (Stable 1b). Inverse association 
was observed for oral, pharynx cancer in Asia rather than Europe and USA (Stable 1b). Inverse associations were 
also observed for prostate cancer and endometrial cancer, with no substantial heterogeneity between subgroups 
(Stables 2b and 3b). Coffee intake was not significantly associated with colorectal cancer incidence in most sub-
group analyses. However, an inverse relation was observed for colon cancer (Stable 1b). An increased risk was 
observed for lung cancer in most subgroups (Stable 4b). No association was observed for esophageal cancer, 
stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, renal cancer, bladder cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer or melanoma in 
subgroup analyses (Stables 1b, 2b, 3b and 4b).
We conducted a sensitivity analysis by excluding studies that were not dose-response analyses to evaluate 
whether the results were stable. The summary relative risk for the highest versus lowest intake of coffee and liver 
cancer was 0.53 (95% CI = 0.43–0.65, I2 = 0%, P = 0.693). The results were 0.87 (95% CI = 0.82–0.92, I2 = 31.8%, 
P = 
 0.154), 0.70 (95% CI = 
 0.63–0.78, I2 = 
 0%, P = 
 0.663), 0.85 (95% CI = 
 0.71–1.03, I2 = 
 05%, P = 
 0.396), 0.62 
(95% CI = 
 0.41–0.94, I2 = 
 64.3%, P = 
 0.024) and 0.89 (95% CI = 
 0.72–1.11, I2 = 
 0%, P = 
 0.882) for prostate cancer, 
endometrial cancer, colon cancer, oral, pharynx cancer and melanoma. The results were similar to those of the 
primary analysis except for colon cancer and melanoma.
Discussion
Our meta-analysis supports an inverse association between coffee intake and oral, pharynx cancer, liver can-
cer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, endometrial cancer and melanoma and increased association for lung cancer. 
Besides, the linear inverse associations were observed for liver cancer, prostate cancer and endometrial cancer. 
However, no significant association was found with esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, rectal cancer, pancreatic 
cancer, renal cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, and 
lymphoma.
To date, our study is the most comprehensive to conduct meta-analyses on coffee intake and cancer. We can 
clearly determine the association between coffee and most types of cancers from our research. Our findings seem 
to be more stable because our analyses were based on prospective studies. We conducted subgroup analyses and 
sensitivity analyses to explore the source of heterogeneity and verify the stability of the results. We also quantified 
the association between coffee intake and liver cancer, prostate cancer and endometrial cancer by conducting 
linear and non-linear dose-response analyses. Begg’s and Egger’s methods were used to evaluate publication bias. 
When the results suggested publication bias, we conducted a trim and fill analysis to determine whether the 
results were different.
Some limitations of our study should be taken into consideration. First, not all of the included studies con-
ducted analyses by potential confounding, which could affect the results. However, we conducted subgroup 
analyses by confounding factors and found no substantial factors influencing the results. Second, some eligi-
ble studies30,38,64 did not provide relative risks and confidence intervals; thus, we extracted raw data for further 
analysis, which may influence the accuracy of the overall results regardless of confounding factors. Third, some 
studies measured the level of coffee intake in milliliters and others reported as cups. Due to the ambiguity in the 
volume contained in a cup of coffee, it was difficult to precisely compare the amount of coffee intake, which could 
influence the results of dose-response analyses. Moreover, we excluded a few studies for dose-response analyses. 
However, the results are similar to those of the analyses of highest versus lowest intake when we conducted sen-
sitivity analyses by excluding these same data. Fourth, some cancers such as oral, pharynx cancer, esophageal 
cancer, renal cancer, lung cancer, melanoma and lymphoma included relatively limited number of studies for 
meta-analysis, may cause problems for evaluation of heterogeneities and publication bias and finally reduce the 
confidence of the results. Finally, our study did not include all types of cancers such as skin cancer, laryngeal 
carcinoma and glioma.
In addition, we found high heterogeneities when we conducted meta-analyses on coffee intake and oral, 
pharynx cancer and lung cancer. Although an inverse association was found between coffee and oral and

pharynx cancer, we did not conduct a further dose-response analysis because of substantial heterogeneity. The 
dose-response analyses were also not conducted for colon cancer, melanoma and lung cancer because of the null 
results of sensitivity analyses. Medium heterogeneities were found in the analyses of coffee intake and renal can-
cer, bladder cancer and stomach cancer. Heterogeneity refers to the inconsistency within included studies. The 
biology diversity and methodological diversity could bring about heterogeneity. To further explore the source of 
heterogeneity, we conducted subgroups analyses and meta-regression analyses based on many factors, such as 
cancer subtypes, geographical location, sex, duration of follow-up and potential confounding factors135. We found 
publication bias in meta-analyses on coffee intake and liver cancer, bladder cancer and ovarian cancer. We con-
ducted trim and fill analyses and found that all of the results were stable. However, the evaluation for publication 
bias is not very reliable when the number of include studies was small. Therefore, we could not draw conclusion 
that there was no obvious publication bias for esophageal cancer, renal cancer, melanoma and lymphoma.
Coffee intake could reduce the incidence of colon cancer, liver cancer, prostate cancer, endometrial cancer, 
oral, pharyngeal cancer and melanoma. There are several mechanisms attempting to explain this phenomenon. 
Coffee contains many bioactive components, including caffeine, cafestol, kahweol, and chlorogenic acid. Some 
studies indicate that caffeine can prevent oxidative DNA damage, modify the apoptotic response and reverse 
the cell cycle checkpoint function136,137. Moreover, some researchers138,139 have found that cafestol and kahweol 
are anticarcinogenic. Feng et al. hypothesized that chlorogenic acids can clear away reactive oxygen species and 
confer an anti-tumor effect140. Dong et al. demonstrated that caffeine suppresses the progression of HCC through 
the Akt signaling pathway141. Furthermore, caffeine and other compounds in coffee increased the clearance of 
estradiol and inhibited estradiol-mediated carcinogenesis in endometrial cells142. Coffee consumption decreased 
the exposure of epithelial cells to carcinogens in the colon by increasing colonic motility143. In addition, coffee has 
been reported to reduce the synthesis and secretion of bile acids, potential promoters of colon carcinogenesis144. 
The decreased risk of these types of cancers may attribute to some potential mechanism, however, there are many 
controversies about the mechanisms. Although a positive association was observed between coffee intake and 
lung cancer, it has been reported that high intakes of coffee are frequently associated with cigarette smoking145, 
which could contribute to the increased risk of lung cancer. However, we take a conservative responsibility for 
the results because of the limited study numbers and the absence of analysis between smokers and nonsmokers.
Our study demonstrates that coffee intake can reduce the risk of oral, pharynx cancer, colon cancer, liver 
cancer, prostate cancer endometrial cancer and melanoma by 31%, 13%, 54%, 11%, 27% and 11% respectively 
for the highest versus lowest coffee intake. Furthermore, coffee intake could reduce the risk of liver cancer, pros-
tate cancer and endometrial cancer by 27%, 3% and 12% with an increment of 2 cups of coffee intake. Inversely, 
coffee intake seems could increase the risk of lung cancer by 118%. However, considering the shortcomings of 
our research, our conclusions should be carefully considered. Further studies are needed to clarify the potential 
underlying mechanisms by which coffee intake may reduce cancer risk. Perhaps add that further studies could 
assess the association among never smokers, particularly for smoking-related lung cancer.
