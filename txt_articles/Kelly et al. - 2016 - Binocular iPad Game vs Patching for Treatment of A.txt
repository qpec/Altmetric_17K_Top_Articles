Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Fellow eye patching has long been the standard treatment for amblyopia, but it 
does not always restore 20/20 vision or teach the eyes to work together. Amblyopia can be treated 
with binocular games that rebalance contrast between the eyes so that a child may overcome 
suppression. However, it is unclear whether binocular treatment is comparable to patching in 
treating amblyopia.

 OBJECTIVES—To assess the effectiveness of a binocular iPad (Apple Inc) adventure game as 
amblyopia treatment and compare this binocular treatment with patching, the current standard of 
care.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—This investigation was a randomized clinical trial 
with a crossover design at a nonprofit eye research institute. Between February 20,2015, and 
January 4, 2016, a total of 28 patients were enrolled in the study, with 14 randomized to binocular 
game treatment and 14 to patching treatment.
INTERVENTIONS—Binocular game and patching as amblyopia treatments.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—The primary outcome was change in amblyopic eye 
best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at the 2-week visit. Secondary outcomes were change in 
stereoacuity and suppression at the 2-week visit and change in BCVA at the 4-week visit.
RESULTS—Among 28 children, the mean (SD) age at baseline was 6.7 (1.4) years (age range, 
4.6–9.5 years), and 7 (25%) were female. At baseline, the mean (SD) amblyopic eye BCVA was 
0.48 (0.14) logMAR (approximately 20/63; range, 0.3–0.8 logMAR [20/40 to 20/125]), with 14 
children randomized to the binocular game and 14 to patching for 2 weeks. At the 2-week visit, 
improvement in amblyopic eye BCVA was greater with the binocular game compared with 
patching, with a mean (SD) improvement of 0.15 (0.08) logMAR (mean [SD], 1.5 [0.8] lines) vs 
0.07 (0.08) logMAR (mean [SD], 0.7 [0.8] line; P = .02) after 2 weeks of treatment. These 
improvements from baseline were significant for the binocular game (mean [SD] improvement, 
1.5 [0.8] lines; P < .001) and for patching (mean [SD] improvement, 0.7 [0.8] line; P = .006). 
Depth of suppression improved from baseline at the 2-week visit for the binocular game (mean 
[SD], 4.82 [2.82] vs 3.24 [2.87]; P = .03) and for patching (mean [SD], 4.77 [3.10] vs 2.57 [1.67]; 
P = .004). Patching children crossed over to binocular game treatment, and all 28 children played 
the game for another 2 weeks. At the 4-week visit, no group difference was found in BCVA 
change, with children who crossed over to the binocular games catching up with children treated 
with binocular games, for a mean (SD) improvement of 0.17 (0.10) logMAR (mean [SD], 1.7 [1.0] 
lines) for the binocular game vs a mean (SD) improvement of 0.16 (0.12) logMAR (mean [SD], 
1.6 [1.2] lines) for the patching crossover (P = .73).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—A binocular iPad game was effective in treating 
childhood amblyopia and was more efficacious than patching at the 2-week visit. Binocular games 
that rebalance contrast to overcome suppression are a promising additional option for treating 
amblyopia.
TRIAL REGISTRATION—clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02365090.
Amblyopia is the leading cause of monocular visual impairment in children, affecting 3% in 
the United States.1 Amblyopia has traditionally been viewed as a monocular disorder that 
can be treated by patching the fellow eye to force use of the amblyopic eye. Patching can 
improve visual acuity for 73% to 90% of children with amblyopia, but 15% to 50% may 
never achieve normal visual acuity after a lengthy course of treatment.2–7 Amblyopia recurs 
after successful treatment in 25% to 50% of children, and normal binocularity is rarely 
restored after patching treatment.4,8–13 Because amblyopia arises from binocular 
discordance when pediatric eye disorders (eg, strabismus or anisometropia) are present, 
binocular treatments are likely to yield better vision outcomes.1,14

 Our laboratory previously reported visual acuity improvements in children with amblyopia 
treated with binocular iPad (Apple Inc) games that reduce fellow eye contrast in an effort to 
rebalance contrast between the eyes.15–17 Contrast rebalancing allows the child to overcome 
interocular suppression and experience binocular vision while playing the games.14,18 Poor 
compliance in 24% to 38% of children indicated that the games developed for our prototype 
iPad platform (Tetris and Pong) were not engaging.15,16 The mean visual acuity gain of 0.1 
logMAR (1 line) found after 4 weeks of binocular games with 16 hours of assigned 
treatment may have been limited by low compliance. A recent study19 in our laboratory 
found that supervised, in-office treatment with movies using the same contrast rebalancing 
approach resulted in a mean visual acuity gain of 0.2 logMAR (2 lines) in just 2 weeks with 
9 hours of treatment. Therefore, a more engaging binocular game could lead to higher 
compliance and larger visual acuity gains with at-home treatment.
While binocular treatment shows significant visual acuity improvements, it is unclear 
whether such therapy is comparable to the standard monocular treatment of fellow eye 
patching. In this randomized clinical trial with a crossover design at a nonprofit eye research 
institute, we assessed the effectiveness of a binocular iPad adventure game as amblyopia 
treatment in children and compared this binocular treatment with patching, the current 
standard of care.
Methods
The research protocol adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki,20 was approved 
by the Institutional Review Board of The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, 
and conformed to the requirements of the US Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act of1996. Written informed consent was obtained from a parent or legal 
guardian before testing of their child and after explanation of the nature and possible 
consequences of the study.
Patient Selection
Inclusion Criteria—Eligible children 4 to 10 years old were diagnosed as having 
amblyopia due to strabismus, anisometropia, or both and were referred to the Retina 
Foundation of the Southwest by 9 pediatric ophthalmologists in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, 
including 3 of us (L.D., C.L.B., and J.N.L.). The eligible children had amblyopic eye best-
corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 0.3 to 0.8 logMAR (20/40 to 20/125) and 0.1 logMAR 
(20/25) or better fellow eye BCVA (0.2 logMAR or better for 4-year-olds), with an 
interocular difference of at least 0.3 logMAR (≥3 lines). Children with strabismus were 
initially diagnosed as having esotropia but were aligned with surgery or spectacle correction 
to within 4 prism diopters of orthotropia at distance and near vision.
Exclusion Criteria—None of the children were born at less than 32 weeks’ post-
gestational age or had coexisting ocular or systemic disease, congenital infections or 
malformations, or developmental delay (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). English was the primary 
language for all children. Medical records were obtained from referring ophthalmologists to 
extract the diagnosis, current alignment, cycloplegic refraction, and prior treatment plan.

 Trial Protocol
This study was a randomized clinical trial (Supplement 2) with the objective of enrolling 56 
children with amblyopia (Figure 1). We preplanned the following 2 cohorts: (1) a primary 
cohort-comprising 28 children to determine the effectiveness of the binocular game as 
amblyopia treatment and whether it is more effective than patching and (2) a secondary 
cohort with an additional 28 children that will be combined with the primary cohort to allow 
evaluation of baseline factors that may affect treatment outcomes (ie, prior treatment, 
etiology of amblyopia, baseline BCVA, and age). Herein, we report data from the primary 
cohort.
Randomization
Randomization was performed by a statistician who provided individual sealed sequentially 
numbered envelopes. Two randomization schedules were created using a random number 
generator function, one for children with prior amblyopia treatment (patching or atropine) 
and another for children with no prior treatment. Randomization (1:1) was prepared in 
permuted blocks with block sizes of 4 or 6. After confirming eligibility and obtaining 
written informed consent, one of us (K.R.K. or R.M.J.) opened a sealed envelope, enrolled 
the child, and assigned him or her to the appropriate treatment.
Treatment Protocols
Treatment groups followed the same protocol timeline and were administered the same 
vision assessments. At the baseline visit, eligibility for enrollment was ascertained, and 
vision assessments were conducted. Children were randomized to binocular game treatment 
or patching treatment for 2 weeks. At the 2-week visit (11–17 days after baseline), vision 
was reassessed. Patching children crossed over to the binocular game, and both groups 
continued treatment for an additional 2 weeks. At the 4-week visit (25–31 days after 
baseline), vision was reassessed. Four weeks marked the end of our study, but children had 
the option to continue game treatment with 2 more follow-up visits (8 and 12 weeks from 
baseline). The primary outcome was change in amblyopic eye BCVA at the 2-week visit. 
Secondary outcomes were change in stereoacuity and suppression at the 2-week visit and 
change in amblyopic eye BCVA at the 4-week visit.
Binocular Game Protocol—Children randomized to binocular game treatment were 
loaned an iPad with an action-oriented adventure game (Dig Rush; developed in 
collaboration with Robert Hess, PhD, DSc, at McGill University [Montréal, Québec, 
Canada], and Amblyotech [Atlanta, Georgia] and UbiSoft [Montréal]) that consists of 
miners digging for gold. Using a finger, the child must manipulate the miners and their 
surroundings to dig and return gold to a cart as quickly as possible while avoiding obstacles 
(eg, fire, lava, and monsters). Up to 3 stars can be earned at the end of each of the 42 levels 
(maximum star count, 126). Levels progressively increase in difficulty. Children can use 
gold to purchase more miners and digging tools, as well as to dig faster and carry more gold 
(Figure 2).
Children were familiarized with the game and practiced until one of us (K.R.K. or R.M.J.) 
was confident in their ability to understand and play it. Children were asked to play the game

 at home for 1 hour a day 5 days a week for 2 weeks (10 hours total). During game play, 
children wore red-green anaglyphic glasses that separate game elements seen by each eye so 
that reduced-contrast elements (eg, gold and fire) are seen by the fellow eye, high-contrast 
elements (eg, miners and monsters) are seen by the amblyopic eye, and high-contrast 
background elements (eg, ground and rocks) are seen by both eyes. For successful game 
play, both eyes must see their respective game components. Amblyopic eye contrast 
remained at 100% contrast, while fellow eye contrast started at 20% but increased with game 
success (a star earned), requiring the amblyopic eye to work harder in tandem with the 
fellow eye. At least 18 hours of game play were required to reach 100% contrast. If game 
play was unsuccessful for 30 minutes (no star earned), fellow eye contrast was reduced. At 
the 2-week visit, children were asked to play the game for an additional 2 weeks.
Patching Protocol—The patching protocol was designed to be similar to the current 
standard of care for amblyopia treatment.2 Children were provided with eye patches 
(Ortopad; Ortopad USA) and were asked to patch their fellow eye 2 hours a day 7 days a 
week for 2 weeks (28 hours total treatment). At the 2-week visit, children assigned to the 
patching protocol crossed over to the binocular game.
Vision Assessment
Vision assessments were conducted at baseline, the 2-week visit, and the 4-week visit and 
included 4 components. First was crowded monocular BCVA using the electronic Early 
Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study protocol21,22 for children at least 7 years old or the 
Amblyopia Treatment Study HOTV protocol for children younger than 7 years.23,24 Second 
was a stereoacuity component (Randot Preschool Stereoacuity and Stereo Butterfly Tests; 
Stereo Optical, Inc). Third was extent of suppression scotoma using the Worth 4-dot test at 7 
different distances.25 Fourth was depth of suppression for children younger than 7 years 
using a dichoptic motion coherence test that determines the maximum contrast of randomly 
moving dots in the fellow eye that still allows the child to discriminate the direction of 
coherent motion dots in the amblyopic eye,16,26 or for children at least 7 years old using a 
dichoptic eye chart adapted from work by Kwon et al27 that determines the contrast ratio at 
which the child reports letters presented to each eye with equal likelihood.28
Adherence to Protocol
Parents or legal guardians were provided a personalized calendar to record the minutes per 
day their child played the game or patched their fellow eye. A log file was also obtained 
from the iPad that contained the minutes played and fellow eye contrast for each play 
session.
Statistical Analysis
The primary outcome was change in amblyopic eye BCVA at the 2-week visit. Sample size 
was based on prior studies showing that, on average, binocular game play for 2 weeks results 
in a mean (SD) improvement of 0.11 (0.10) logMAR (1.1 lines)15,16 and that patching for 2 
weeks results in a mean (SD) improvement of 0.00 (0.10) logMAR (0 line).4–6 For α = .05 
and 1 − β of 0.80, the required sample size was 13 children per group. To account for an 
anticipated 5% dropout rate, we planned to enroll 28 children (14 per group).

 Stereoacuity was converted to log arcsec for analyses, and nil stereoacuity was arbitrarily 
assigned a value of 4 log arcsec. The farthest distance at which the child reported 4 dots was 
converted to size of suppression scotoma in degrees.25 The tests of depth of suppression 
determine the minimum contrast ratio (amblyopic eye contrast divided by fellow eye 
contrast) at which the amblyopic eye was not suppressed. All analyses were conducted with 
an intent-to-treat approach.
In the primary analysis, an independent t test was conducted to determine whether 
improvement in amblyopic eye BCVA differed between the binocular game and patching 
treatments at the 2-week primary outcome visit. In the secondary analyses, paired t tests 
were conducted per group to determine whether amblyopic eye BCVA had improved 
significantly from baseline at the 2-week visit. An independent t test was conducted to 
determine whether improvement in amblyopic eye BCVA differed between the binocular 
game and patching crossover groups at the 4-week visit. Paired sign tests were conducted 
per group to determine whether stereoacuity had improved from baseline at the 2-week visit. 
Paired t tests were conducted per group to determine whether extent of suppression scotoma 
and depth of suppression had improved from baseline at the 2-week visit. Group differences 
in stereoacuity were analyzed using a Mann-Whitney test, and group differences in extent 
and depth of suppression were analyzed using independent t tests. All tests were performed 
using a 2-tailed α = .05.
Results
Between February 20, 2015, and January 4, 2016, a total of 28 patients were enrolled in the 
study, with 14 randomized to binocular game treatment and 14 to patching treatment (Figure 
1). The 2-week outcome visit was completed by all children except for 1 child randomized 
to the binocular game who had a scheduling conflict but who attended the 4-week visit. All 
28 children completed the 4-week visit. There were no study dropouts.
Baseline characteristics are listed in eTable 2 in Supplement 1. Nine children (32%) had 
strabismic amblyopia, 14 (50%) had anisometropic amblyopia, and 5 (18%) had combined-
mechanism amblyopia. Their mean (SD) age was 6.7 (1.4) years (age range, 4.6–9.5 years), 
and 7 (25%) were female. The mean (SD) amblyopic eye BCVA at enrollment was 0.48 
(0.14) logMAR (approximately 20/63; range, 0.3–0.8 logMAR [20/40 to 20/125]). Moderate 
amblyopia (range, 0.3–0.6 logMAR [20/40 to 20/80]) was present in 23 children (82%), and 
severe amblyopia (range, 0.7–0.8 logMAR [20/100 to 20/125]) was present in 5 (18%). 
Twenty children (71%) had received prior amblyopia treatment.
Adherence to Protocol
Compliance for iPad game play using the personalized calendar was similar to that using the 
iPad log; therefore, the latter was used. Compliance for patching was tabulated using the 
personalized calendar. For the first 2 weeks, children assigned to the binocular game 
completed a mean (SD) of 10.0 (2.3) hours (100% prescribed treatment time). The mean 
(SD) fellow eye contrast was 46% (15%) at the 2-week visit (iPad contrast logs were 
available for 11 to 14 children). Children assigned to patching completed a mean (SD) of 
27.7 (3.0) hours (99% prescribed treatment time). For the second 2 weeks, all children were

 assigned to the binocular game, and they completed a mean (SD) of 8.2 (3.4) hours (82% 
prescribed treatment time). The mean (SD) fellow eye contrast at the 4-week visit was 71% 
(28%) for children who played the game for 4 weeks and 50% (16%) for children who 
crossed over to the binocular game (iPad contrast logs were available for 27 of 28 children).
Primary Outcome
At the 2-week primary outcome visit, a larger improvement in amblyopic eye BCVA was 
found with the binocular game compared with patching, with a mean (SD) improvement of 
0.15 (0.08) logMAR (mean [SD], 1.5 [0.8] lines) vs 0.07 (0.08) logMAR (mean [SD], 0.7 
[0.8] line improvement) (mean difference, 0.07 logMAR [0.7 line]; 95% CI, 0.01–0.14 
logMAR [0.1–1.4 lines]; t25 = 2.42, P = .02). For the binocular game, improvement ranged 
from 0.0 to 0.2 logMAR (0–2 lines): 11 children (85%; 95% CI, 58%−96%) improved by at 
least 0.1 logMAR (8 of whom improved by 0.2 logMAR [2 lines], and 3 of whom improved 
by 0.1 logMAR [1 line]), and 2 (15%; 95% CI, 3%−46%) did not improve. For patching, 
improvement ranged from 0.0 to 0.2 logMAR (0–2 lines): 7 children (50%; 95% CI, 27%
−73%) improved by at least 0.1 logMAR (3 of whom improved by 0.2 logMAR [2 lines], 
and 4 of whom improved by 0.1 logMAR [1 line]), and 7 (50%; 95% CI, 27%−73%) did not 
improve.
Secondary Outcomes
Amblyopic eye BCVA had improved at the 2-week visit with the binocular game (mean 
[SD] improvement, 1.5 [0.8] lines; t12 = 6.79, P < .001) and with patching (mean [SD] 
improvement, 0.7 [0.8] line; t13 = 3.24, P = .006). At the 4-week visit, amblyopic eye BCVA 
had improved for children who crossed over to the binocular game, resulting in their 
catching up with children who started with the binocular game, with a mean (SD) 
improvement of 0.17 (0.10) logMAR (mean [SD], 1.7 [1.0] lines) for the binocular game vs 
a mean (SD) improvement of 0.16 (0.12) logMAR (mean [SD], 1.6 [1.2] lines) for patching 
crossover (mean difference, 0.01 logMAR; 95% CI, −0.07 to 0.01 logMAR; t26 = 0.35, P = .
73) (Figure 3). Overall, 23 children (82%) improved by at least 0.1 logMAR (1 line) (Figure 
4).
At baseline, 1 child had normal stereoacuity, 10 children had reduced (subnormal but 
measurable) stereoacuity, and 17 children had nil stereoacuity (assigned a value of 4). No 
change in stereoacuity was seen at the 2-week visit with the binocular game (median 
[interquartile range], 4.00 [2.85–4.00] vs 4.00 [2.60–4.00] log arcsec; z = 0.71, P = .48) or 
with patching (median [interquartile range], 4.00 [2.60–4.00] vs 4.00 [2.60–4.00] log arcsec; 
z = 0.71, P = .48).
Extent of suppression scotoma (Worth 4-dot test) had not changed from baseline at the 2-
week visit with the binocular game (mean [SD], 7.16 [8.91] degrees vs 4.95 [7.07] degrees; 
t12 = 1.32, P = .21) or with patching (mean [SD], 3.27 [3.02] degrees vs 5.31 [8.89] degrees; 
t13 = 1.17, P = .26). However, depth of suppression measured by the contrast ratio showed 
improvement from baseline at the 2-week visit with the binocular game (mean [SD], 4.82 
[2.82] vs 3.24 [2.87]; t12 = 2.46, P = .03) and with patching (mean [SD], 4.77 [3.10] vs 2.57 
[1.67]; t13 = 3.41, P = .005) (Figure 5).

 No differences between the binocular game vs patching treatments were found at the 2-week 
visit for change in stereoacuity, extent of suppression, and depth of suppression. For change 
in stereoacuity, the respective median (interquartile range) changes were −0.00 (0.00–0.00) 
vs 0.00 (0.00–0.00) log arcsec (U = 79.00, P = .56). For extent of suppression, the respective 
mean (SD) changes were −2.21 (6.02) vs 2.05 (6.52) degrees (mean difference, 4.10 degrees; 
95% CI, −0.71 to 8.91 degrees; t25 = −1.76, P = .09). For depth of suppression, the 
respective mean (SD) values were 1.58 (2.31) vs 2.20 (2.42) (mean difference, 0.63; 95% 
CI, −1.25 to 2.51; t25 = 0.69, P = .50).
Discussion
Our randomized clinical trial showed that binocular game treatment is more successful than 
patching in improving amblyopic eye visual acuity with 2 weeks of treatment. A mean 
visual acuity improvement of 0.15 logMAR (1.5 lines) after binocular treatment was more 
than double the 0.07 logMAR (0.7 line) improvement found with patching and was achieved 
with less than 50% treatment time required for patching (10 vs 28 hours assigned treatment). 
Three times as many children improved 0.2 logMAR (2 lines) with the binocular game (8 of 
13 children [62%]) compared with patching (3 of 14 children [21%]) after 2 weeks of 
treatment. In fact, 5 of 13 children (39%) with binocular treatment reached 20/32 or better 
visual acuity compared with 1 of 14 children (7%) with patching. Two weeks of patching 
was inadequate to achieve the maximum improvement previously reported (3 lines) with 6 
months of patching.29 We show that in just 2 weeks, visual acuity gain with binocular 
treatment was half that found with 6 months of patching, suggesting that binocular treatment 
may yield faster gains than patching. Whether long-termbinocular treatment is as effective in 
remediating amblyopia as patching remains to be investigated.
Our finding of 1.7 lines of improvement after 4 weeks of binocular game treatment is larger 
than the 1 line of improvement found in our group’s previous studies using Tetris and Pong.
15−17 The magnitude of improvement was more similar to the 2 lines found with dichoptic 
movie treatment,19 suggesting that a larger improvement may be owing to better compliance 
with our adventure game. Indeed, 85% (23 of 27) of children played at least 75% of 
prescribed treatment compared with 44% (20 of 45) in the Tetris game study.15 Furthermore, 
some children at the 4-week visit in our study had already completed all game levels or had 
reached 100% fellow eye contrast.
A significant improvement in depth of suppression in children after both binocular game and 
patching treatments is consistent with a correlation between amblyopic eye visual acuity and 
depth of suppression.28,30–32 Small sample sizes or children’s difficulty with the 
psychophysical taskusedto measure suppression may underlie a lack of suppression changes 
in children with amblyopia in previous binocular treatment studies.16,18,19 However, our data 
are consistent with reduced suppression in amblyopic adults after binocular game treatment.
33,34 There has been a focus on interocular suppression in the etiology of amblyopia,1,14,28 
and alleviating suppression with binocular treatment may be the key to amblyopia treatment. 
We found no improvement in stereoacuity or in extent of the suppression scotoma (Worth 4-
dot test) herein. Future amblyopia treatment studies should investigate ways of improving 
binocular vision outcomes, such as stereoacuity.

 Binocular treatment for amblyopia is novel, and many questions remain. It needs to be 
determined how to convert binocular games to longer-term amblyopia treatment (eg, 
development of a variety of engaging games, adjustment of contrast levels, and maintenance 
treatment). Our primary cohort sample size was too small to evaluate baseline factors (ie, 
prior treatment, etiology of amblyopia, BCVA, and age) that may be important modifiers of 
treatment effect. The preplanned analyses of the combined primary and secondary cohorts 
will allow us to examine the effect of these potential modifiers. Our finding that children in 
the crossover arm improved both in the patching and binocular game phases suggests that 
future investigation of combination treatment may be worthwhile. Last, the results herein 
cannot be generalized to other forms of amblyopia, such as deprivation amblyopia due to

Conclusions
Our binocular iPad game was a successful treatment for childhood amblyopia and was more 
effective than patching at the 2-week visit. Although we had a small sample size and 
treatment lasted only 2 to 4 weeks, binocular games that rebalance contrast to overcome 
suppression are a promising additional option for treating amblyopia.

 Key Points
Questions
Will a binocular iPad (Apple Inc) game be effective in treating childhood amblyopia, and 
how does the visual acuity improvement compare with that obtained with 2 hours of daily 
patching?
Findings
In this randomized clinical trial with a crossover design at the 2-week visit, binocular 
treatment with an iPad game improved amblyopic eye visual acuity by 1.5 lines 
compared with 0.7 line with patching.
Meaning
Binocular games that rebalance contrast to overcome suppression are a promising 
additional option for treating amblyopia; however, whether long-term binocular treatment 
is as effective in remediating amblyopia as patching remains to be investigated.

 Figure 1. Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Diagram
Shown are the numbers of completed and missed visits during the 4-week study. One child 
randomized to the binocular game missed the 2-week visit because of a scheduling conflict 
but attended the 4-week visit. There were no dropouts between baseline and the 4-week 
visit.

 Figure 2. Screen Shot of Dig Rush
High-contrast red elements (miners and fireball) are seen by the amblyopic eye. Low-
contrast blue elements (gold and cart) are seen by the fellow eye. Gray elements (rocks and 
ground) are seen by both eyes. Both eyes must see the game for successful play. Dig Rush 
was developed in collaboration with Robert Hess, PhD, DSc, at McGill University 
(Montréal, Québec, Canada), and Amblyotech (Atlanta, Georgia) and UbiSoft (Montréal).
