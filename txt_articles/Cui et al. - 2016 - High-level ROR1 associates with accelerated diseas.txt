Key Points
• The expression level of
ROR1 on CLL cells varies
between patients.
• High-level CLL-cell expression
of ROR1 associates with
more aggressive disease.
ROR1 is an oncoembryonic orphan receptor found on chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(CLL) B cells, but not on normal postpartum tissues. ROR1 is a receptor for Wnt5a that
may complex with TCL1, a coactivator of AKT that is able to promote development of CLL.
We found the CLL cells of a few patients expressed negligible ROR1 (ROR1Neg), but
expressed TCL1A at levels comparable to those of samples that expressed ROR1
(ROR1Pos). Transcriptome analyses revealed that ROR1Neg cases generally could be
distinguished from those that were ROR1Pos in unsupervised gene-expression clustering
analysis. Gene-set enrichment analyses demonstrated that ROR1Neg CLL had lower
expression and activation of AKT signaling pathways relative to ROR1Pos CLL, similar to
what was noted for leukemia that respectively developed in TCL1 vs ROR1xTCL1 transgenic mice. In contrast to its effect on ROR1Pos
CLL, Wnt5a did not enhance the proliferation, chemotaxis, or survival of ROR1Neg CLL. We examined the CLL cells from 1568 patients,
which we randomly assigned to a training or validation set of 797 or 771 cases, respectively. Using recursive partitioning, we defined a
thresholdforROR1surfaceexpressionthatcouldsegregatesamplesofthetrainingsetintoROR1-HivsROR1-Losubgroupsthatdiffered
significantly in their median treatment-free survival (TFS). Using this threshold, we found that ROR1-Hi cases had a significantly shorter
medianTFS andoverallsurvival thanROR1-Locasesinthevalidationset.Thesedatademonstratethat expressionof ROR1 maypromote
leukemia-cell activation and survival and enhance disease progression in patients with CLL. (Blood. 2016;128(25):2931-2940)
Introduction
ROR1 is a developmentally restricted, type I tyrosine kinase–like
orphan receptor expressed on the neoplastic B cells of patients with
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), but not on the presumed normal
counterpart to CLL, the CD5 B cell.1-3 ROR1 is a receptor for Wnt5a,1
whichrecentstudiesshowcanpromoteCLLcellsurvival,proliferation,
and migration in a ROR1-dependent manner.4 On the other hand,
reducing ROR1 expression on CLL cells via small interfering RNA can
decrease leukemia-cell survival.5
Studies indicate that ROR1 can accelerate the development and
progression of leukemia in mouse models of human CLL. ROR1 may
complex with a known coactivator of AKT, namely, TCL1, which,
when expressed under the control of an immunoglobulin promoter/
enhancer, promotes development of leukemia similar to that of patients
with CLL in TCL1 transgenic mice.6 However, in contrast to human
CLL, the leukemia that develops in TCL1 transgenic mice does
not express ROR1.7 On the other hand, mice that have both human
TCL1 and ROR1 transgenes under the control of an immunoglobulin
promoter/enhancer develop leukemia that is ROR1-positive. Such dou-
ble transgenic mice develop leukemia at a significantly younger median
age and have a shorter median survival due to aggressive leukemia
than do otherwise syngeneic TCL1 transgenic mice.7 Furthermore, the
ROR1-positive leukemia that develops in ROR1xTCL1 transgenic
micehavehigher-levelexpressionofpathwaysimplicatedinembryonic
and/or tumor-cell proliferation, but lower expression of pathways
involved in cell-cell adhesion or cell death, than the ROR1-negative
leukemia that develops in TCL1 mice. ROR1xTCL1 leukemia cells
also had higher levels of phospho-AKT, higher proportions of
Ki-67–positive cells, lower proportions of cells undergoing spontaneous

 apoptosis, and produced more aggressive disease upon adoptive
transfer than TCL1 leukemia cells that lacked ROR1. Collectively,
these studies demonstrated that ROR1 could accelerate the develop-
ment and progression of leukemia in this transgenic mouse model.
Nevertheless, prior studies found ROR1 expressed by virtually
all cases of CLL, independent of established prognostic markers,
such as the mutation status of immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable
region genes (IGHV) or the expression of ZAP-70.1-3 However, we
reinterrogated the published database of the Microarray Innovations
in Leukemia study and noted that a few of the 448 cases examined in
this study expressed low to negligible amounts of ROR1.8 Such cases
expressed the gene encoding TCL1, TCL1A, at levels comparable to
those observed for CLL samples that expressed high levels of ROR1
(supplemental Figure 1, available on the Blood Web site). We
hypothesized that low-level leukemia-cell expression of ROR1
might be associated with more indolent disease.
In the present study, we examined the transcriptomes of 12 CLL
cases with low to negligible ROR1 (designated as ROR1Neg) and 12
CLL cases that expressed levels of ROR1 more commonly found on
CLL (designated as ROR1Pos). We then examined the relationship
between leukemia-cell expression of ROR1 and clinical progression in
1568 patients followed by clinical investigators in the CLL Research
Consortium (CRC).
Materials and methods
Sample collection and preparation
This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki for the
protection of human subjects. Blood samples were collected from consenting
patients who satisfied diagnostic criteria for CLL and who enrolled in the CRC
Tissue Core. Blood samples were obtained from CLL patients examined at CRC
sites:UCSanDiegoMooresCancerCenter(n5353),MDAndersonCancerCen-
ter (n 5 382), North Shore-Long Island Jewish Cancer Institute (n 5 264), Mayo
Clinic (n 5 192), Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (n 5 166), The Ohio State
University(n 5155),andBartsCancerInstitute(n556).Atthetimeofsample
collection, 1331 patients (85%) had not received prior therapy; 237 patients
(15%) had received prior therapy; 163 patients (10%) had samples obtained at
diagnosis, and the median time between diagnosis and sample collection
(delayed entry time) was 1.3 years (the lower quartile time and upper quartile
time are 0.2 years and 4.8 years, respectively). We used Ficoll-Hypaque
density-gradient centrifugation to isolate mononuclear cells, which were
cryopreserved in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide for storage in liquid nitrogen until
analysis. Samples with .90% CD191CD51 CLL cells were used without
further purification throughout this study. IGHV mutation status was assessed
as per established criteria.9
Patient cohorts and ROR1 expression
Cohort 1: Previously published gene expression data from Microarray
Innovations in Leukemia study datasets (GSE 13204) of 448 CLL patients
deposited in PubMed GEO database were downloaded to analyze for expres-
sion of ROR1 and TCL1A8; Cohort 2: Next-generation sequencing on the
transcriptome of 12 patient samples that had low to negligible expression
of ROR1 (designated as ROR1Neg) and 12 samples that expressed ROR1
(designated as ROR1Pos). We used flow cytometry to determine the “ROR1
DMFI,” which is the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD191 cells
stained with an Alexa-647–conjugated anti-ROR1 monoclonal antibody
(mAb; 4A5) minus the MFI of the CD191 cells stained with an Alexa-647-
conjugated nonspecific mAb of the same isotype; Cohort 3: We examined for
expression of ROR1 on CLL cells in serial samples collected at different times
from 11 untreated patients and 10 patients who had received therapy for CLL.
The median time that lapsed between the first and last sample collected for
patients in this longitudinal survey was 8.3 years; Cohort 4: 1568 patient
samples from CRC Tissue Core were randomly segregated into either of 2
cohorts: a training set of 797 and a validation set of 771 cases. Training and
validation cohorts could be segregated into 2 disparate subgroups based upon
whether the CLL cells had a ROR1 DMFI less than optimal threshold 32
(“ROR1-Lo”) or greater than or equal to optimal threshold 32 (“ROR1-Hi”).
Descriptions of flow cytometry analyses, library preparation, sequencing,
gene differential expression,unsupervisedclustering, subnetworkanalyses,gene
set enrichment analysis, immunoblot analysis, viability, proliferation and
migration assays, and statistical analyses are provided in the supplemental

Results
Transcriptome analyses of ROR1Neg and ROR1Pos CLL
We examined the leukemia cells of 12 ROR1Neg cases with low to
negligible ROR1 and 12 ROR1Pos cases, which expressed levels of
ROR1 comparable with that commonly found in CLL (Figure 1A-C).
Six of the 12 ROR1Neg cases used unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-
chain variable region genes (U-IGHV), whereas 8 of the 12 ROR1Pos
cases used U-IGHV (supplemental Table 1). The average ROR1 DMFI
for the ROR1Neg samples was 2 6 2 (6 SD), whereas the average
ROR1 DMFI for the ROR1Pos samples was 44 6 15. For comparison,
the average ROR1 DMFI for representative normal blood B cells of
adults was 1.0 6 1.1, n 5 14. Immunoblot analyses of lysates from
representativecasesdemonstratedtheROR1Negsampleshadnegligible
ROR1,incontrasttotheROR1Poscases,indicatingthattheCLLcellsof
ROR1Neg cases also lacked detectable cytoplasmic ROR1 (Figure 1D).
We performed massive parallel sequencing to examine the
transcriptomes of these 24 leukemia samples. Each had a CLL gene-
expression signature (Figure 1E-F), which was distinct from those
identified in earlier studies of normal B cells or other B-cell ma-
lignancies.10-13 Between ROR1Pos and ROR1Neg cases, we found dif-
ferential expression in only 1 of the 20 genes found in prior studies to
be differentially expressed between CLL with U-IGHV vs CLL
with mutated-IGHV (M-IGHV), namely CTLA4, P 5 .0006,
Bonferroni’smultiplecomparisonstest(supplementalFigure2A-B).12
Furthermore, we did not find significant differences between ROR1Pos
and ROR1Neg cases in their relative expression of the genes that report-
edly were upregulated in monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis relative
to CLL (supplemental Figure 2C).14 Finally, ROR1Neg and ROR1Pos
cases expressed comparable levels of TCL1A (P 5 .7; Figure 1G).
We did find that 3094 of 14 761 protein-coding genes were
differentially expressed in ROR1Neg vs ROR1Pos cases, 1 of which was
ROR1 (DESeq2, BH-adjusted; P , .05). We performed unsupervised
clustering on the log2 effective count z scores for the 2000 genes
expressed in all samples that had the highest coefficients of variation.
Unsupervised clustering distinguished the ROR1Neg and ROR1Pos
cases, except for 1 outlier (Figure 2A).
We used the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis based on Ingenuity
Knowledge Base to define gene expression subnetworks, which were
derived from integrating the expression levels of genes encoding
proteins known to interact with 1 another.7,15 We identified 55 sub-
networks that were differentially expressed between ROR1Pos vs
ROR1Neg cases, with a false discovery rate of ,0.05 (supplemen-
tal Figure 3A). The ROR1Pos leukemia cells had higher levels of
subnetworks associated with protein kinase activation and prolifera-
tion of tumor cells, but lower levels of subnetworks associated with
apoptosis and RNA decay and processing, than did ROR1Neg leu-
kemia cells (Figure 2B; supplemental Figure 3B). The gene encoding
AKT1 contributed to many of these subnetworks (supplemental

 Figure 3B). ROR1 and AKT1 were found included in 7 subnetworks
associated with cell viability, proliferation, hematologic cancer, or
inhibition of cell death. Fourteen (25%) of these 55 subnetworks also
were differentially expressed between the ROR1-positive leukemia
cells of ROR1xTCL1 transgenic mice vs the ROR1-negative
leukemia cells of TCL1 transgenic mice (Figure 2C), only 2 of which
had discordant activation z scores.7
We performed gene-set enrichment analysis, focusing on selected
signalingpathwaysintheBIOCARTAandReactomedatabases.Wedid
not observe significant differences in the expression levels of genes
encoding proteins upregulated by or involved in NF-kB signaling, Src
activation, B-cell receptor signaling, CREB signaling, or mTOR
signaling (supplemental Table 2). On the other hand, ROR1Pos CLL
cases had higher expression levels of genes encoding proteins in AKT-
signaling pathway (Reactome), which were the 2 most significantly
enriched gene sets (false discovery rate ,25%) (supplemental Figure 4;
supplemental Table 2). Consistent with the notion that ROR1Pos CLL
cells have enhanced activation of AKT-signaling pathways, we found
that the average normalized ratio of phosphorylated AKT to total AKT in
ROR1PosCLLcases(869[6SD],n56)wassignificantlyhigher than
that noted in ROR1Neg CLL samples (1 6 1, n 5 6, P 5 .003, Mann-
Whitney U test), as assessed via immunoblot analyses (Figure 2D).
ROR1Pos CLL cells have enhanced survival, migration,
and proliferation
Prior studies found that Wnt5a could enhance CLL-cell viability,
migration, and proliferation in a ROR1-dependent manner.4,16,17 We
found that ROR1Neg CLL cells had a poorer viability than ROR1Pos CLL
cells after 48 hours in vitro (Figure 3A), possibly due the inability of

Relationship between expression of ROR1 and
disease progression
To study the stability of ROR1 expression on the leukemia cells over
time, we examined serial CLL samples collected at different times from
11 untreated patients (supplemental Figure 5) and 10 patients who had
received therapy for CLL (supplemental Figure 6). The median time
that lapsed between the first and last sample collected from patients in
this longitudinal survey was 8.3 years. Although the expression levels
of ROR1 varied between the different patients, we did not observe
substantial variation of the relative expression of ROR1 on the CLL
cells of any 1 patient over time or with therapy (supplemental Figures 5
and 6). Collectively, the mean serial-sample variation in ROR1 DMFI
was 1.5 6 3.9 (mean 6 SD, n 5 21; supplemental Figures 5 and 6).
We next examined the data on 1568 CLL patients assessed for
ROR1 by the CRC Tissue Core (supplemental Table 3). The median
ROR1 DMFI for all cases was 35.2 and, as expected, the vast majority
expressed ROR1. However, there was considerable heterogeneity in
the expression levels of ROR1 between cases, with DMFI ranging from
1 to above 400. Five percent of all patients had leukemia cells with a
median DMFI of 1.6 61.6 (6SD,n 580),which was not significantly
different from the ROR1 DMFI of blood B cells obtained from healthy
adults (1.0 6 1.1, n 5 14; P 5 .18; Figure 1B-C).
We randomly segregated these cases into a training set of 797 cases
and a validation set of 771 cases. In the training dataset, 40% of patients
had received treatment (n 5 320), with median treatment-free survival
(TFS) of 7.8 years, and 8% were deceased (n 5 65). On the other hand,
the median TFS for patients in the validation cohort was 6.7 years; 40%
(n5306)ofthepatientsinthissubsethadreceivedtherapyand9%(n569)
weredeceased.Weobtainedsamplesatdiagnosisfor10%(n569)ofthe
797 cases in the training set and 12% of 771 samples in the validation set.
We employed the profile-likelihood method in a Cox regression
model of TFS by R ‘rpart’ package from diagnosis to determine whether
we could assign an optimal ROR1 DMFI threshold that could segregate
patients in the training set into subgroups with disparate TFS. We found
this cohort could be segregated into 2 disparate subgroups based upon
whether the CLL cells had a ROR1 DMFI ,32 (defined as “ROR1-
Lo”), or $32 (defined as “ROR1-Hi”) (supplemental Figure 7). Three-
hundred forty patients (43% of the total) were classified as “ROR1-Lo”;
the median ROR1 DMFI for this subgroup was 20 6 10 (6 SD)
(interquartile range 15; supplemental Figure 7). On the other hand, 457
patients were classified as being “ROR1-Hi”; the median ROR1 DMFI
for this subgroup was 49 6 34 (interquartile range 21; supplemental
Figure 7). The patients in the ROR1-Hi subgroup had a median TFS of
5.7years,whereasthoseintheROR1-LosubgrouphadamedianTFSof
9.3 years (Figure 4A). Although not factored in the analysis to define the
DMFIthresholdforROR1-HivsROR1-Lo,wenotedthatpatientsinthe
training cohort who were in the ROR1-Hi subgroup had shorter median
overall survival (OS) than those in the ROR1-Lo subgroup (P , .05,
hazard ratio [HR] 1.7; 95% confidence interval[CI] 1.1, 2.9;Figure 4C).
We applied this same threshold to stratify the 771 patients in the
validation cohort. Three hundred thirty-five patients (43% of 771)
fell into the ROR1-Lo subgroup; the median ROR1 DMFI for this
subgroup was 18 6 9 (6 SD) (interquartile range 14). The remaining
436 cases fell into the ROR1-Hi subgroup; the median ROR1 DMFI
for this subgroup was 46 6 28 (interquartile range 18). Similar to our
observations with the training cohort, the patients in the ROR1-Hi
subgroup had a median TFS of 5.7 years, which was significantly
shorter than that of the patients in the ROR1-Lo subgroup, who had a
median TFS of 11.8 years (Figure 4B). The patients in the ROR1-Hi
subgroup ofthe validation cohort had a median OSof 16.4years,which
was significantly shorter than that of patients in the ROR1-Lo subgroup
(.20 years) (P , .001, HR 2.4; 95% CI 1.5, 3.8; Figure 4D).
Relationship between expression of ROR1 and other
leukemia characteristics
The ROR1-Hi and ROR1-Lo cases in either the training set or the
validation set expressed comparable levelsof surface antigens typically
found on CLL cells (eg, CD5, CD20, and CD23) (supplemental
Figure 8). Although largely overlapping, the median DMFI for CD5
was significantly higher for ROR1-Hi cases than in ROR1-Lo cases
(P , .001; supplemental Table 4). On the other hand, the ROR1-Hi
cases had a lower median DMFI for CD20 than the ROR1-Lo cases, in
both the training and the validation cohorts (supplemental Table 4).
The IGHV mutation status was known for 593 of the 797 patients in
the training set (74%) and for 586 of the 771 patients in the validation set
(76%) (supplemental Table 3). CLL samples with U-IGHV had higher
averageROR1DMFIinthetrainingcohort(45625[6SD])orvalidation
cohort (42 6 20) than CLL samples with M-IGHV in either the training
cohort (37 6 32, P , .001) or validation cohort (36 6 26; P , .001),
respectively (supplemental Figure 9A-B). CLL samples with U-IGHV
also comprised a higher proportion ofthe ROR1-Hi subgroup in either the
training cohort (54%) or the validation cohort (59%) than CLL samples
withM-IGHV(P,.0001,Pearsonx2test;Table1).Conversely,theCLL
samples that used M-IGHV comprised a higher proportion of the ROR1-
Lo subgroup in either the training cohort (67%) or the validation cohort
(61%) than samples with U-IGHV.Nevertheless,half of all608 cases that
used M-IGHV were in the ROR1-Hi subgroup and approximately one-
third (30%, n 5 171) of the 571 cases that used U-IGHV were in the
ROR1-Lo subgroup, indicating that the association between ROR1-
Hi and use of U-IGHV was not absolute.
High-level expression of ROR1 also appeared associated with other
adverse prognostic markers (supplemental Figure 9C-D; supplemental
Table 5). We noted a significant association between high-level ROR1
and expression of ZAP-70 in the training cohort (P , .05) and the
validation cohort (P , .01; supplemental Table 5); however, this
association was not as strong as that noted with the use of U-IGHV
genes (P , .0001 in both cohorts; Table 1). On the other hand, we did
notdiscern a significant difference inthe expression level of CD38 on
ROR1-Hi CLL vs ROR1-Lo CLL in either the training or the val-
idation cohort (supplemental Table 4).
Fluorescence in situ hybridization data were available for 455 of
the 797 patientsinthe trainingset(57%)and for 431ofthe771 patients
in the validation set (56%) (supplemental Table 6). Training and
validation cohorts showed similar distribution of cytogenetic abnor-
malities (supplemental Table 7).
Multivariate analyses of ROR1 with other prognostic
parameters
Using a multivariate Cox regression model with either a nondelayed
entry or a delayed entry to account for a lag between diagnosisand time
of collecting the samples in the validation cohort, we observed that
high-level expression of ROR1 had predictive value for short TFS
(nondelayed entry HR 1.4, P , .01; delayed entry HR 1.7, P , .01),
evenwhenwefactoredinthemodelIGHVmutationstatus(nondelayed
entry HR 2.7, P , .001; delayed entry HR 2.7, P , .001; supplemental
Table 8) or adverse cytogenetic features, such as del(17p) or del(11q)
(supplemental Table 9). In particular, patients in the ROR1-Hi
subgroup of the validation cohort who had CLL cells with M-IGHV

 (n 5 144) had a significantly shorter median TFS (10.7 years) than
patients in the ROR1-Lo subset who had CLL cells that used M-IGHV
(14.1 years, n 5 144) (supplemental Figure 10B). On the other hand,
the apparent difference in the TFS for ROR1-Hi vs ROR1-Lo patients
who had CLL cells that used U-IGHV genes did not reach statistical
significance. Similar results were noted for patients in the training
cohort (supplemental Figure 10A).
We assimilated the data from both training and validation cohorts,
allowing us to examine the relationship between expression level of
ROR1, IGHV mutation status, and outcome for the entire group of
patients for whom we have IGHV mutation status.As expected, among
patients who had CLL cells with M-IGHV in the combined cohort,
those in the ROR1-Hi subgroup had a significantly shorter median TFS
(10 years, n 5 307) and OS than patients who were in the ROR1-Lo
subset (median TFS 5 14.1 years, n 5 301; P , .01; Figure 5). Among
patients who had CLL cells with U-IGHV, those within the ROR1-Hi
subgroup had a shorter median TFS (4.0 years, n 5 400) than those in
the ROR1-Lo subset (4.6 years, n 5 171; Figure 5A) that now reached
statistical significance (P , .02); however, we did not observe a
significant difference between the median OS of those in ROR1-Hi
subgroup(15.9years,n5400)vsthemedianOSofthoseintheROR1-
Lo subgroup (undefined, n 5 171; Figure 5B), despite the larger
numbers of patients included in these analyses.
The IGHV mutational status and fluorescence in situ hybridization
data were available for a total of 680 patients in the combined cohorts
(supplementalTable6).Althoughtherewasa higherfrequencyofcases
with adverse cytogenetic features, (eg, del(17p) or del(11q)) among
patients in the ROR1-Hi subgroup (supplemental Table 7), this
apparently reflected the higher prevalence of such cytogenetic
abnormalities among cases with U-IGHV (supplemental Table 10), as
noted in prior studies.18 For example, among patients with U-IGHV,

158 cases) or del(11q) (1%, or 1 of the 158 cases) in the ROR1-Lo
subset.
Discussion
In this study, we found that the levels of ROR1 on CLL cells varied
between patients. Whereas the vast majority of cases expressed
detectable ROR1, ;5% of cases had negligible levels of ROR1 that
were comparable to that of B cells of healthy adults. In addition to
satisfying diagnostic criteria for CLL, such cases also had CLL gene-
expression signatures, indicating that they indeed represented CLL and
not some other B-cell malignancy masquerading as CLL. Among those
cases that did express detectable ROR1, we also noted considerable
heterogeneity in the levels of this orphan receptor on the CLL cells of
different patients. Evaluation of serial samples revealed that the
expressionlevelsofROR1didnotvarysubstantiallyovertime,asnoted
in a prior study.19 However, this earlier study also noted an increase in
the frequency of ROR11 cells upon development of more progressive
disease. Although we did not discern an increase in the expression
levels of ROR1 on the CLL cells of any 1 patient over time, we cannot
excludethepossibilitytheleukemiacellsofsomepatientsmightchange
their relative expression of ROR1 in certain clinical settings.
Transcriptome analyses revealed that cases with negligible ROR1
had gene expression signatures that were distinct from those of
ROR1Pos cases. Except for 1 outlier, unsupervised gene-expression-
clustering analysis could distinguish ROR1Pos cases from ROR1Neg
samples. Subnetwork analysis showed that RORNeg CLL cases had
relatively low-level expression of protein kinase activation and
proliferation subnetworks, particularly those involving activation of
AKT. Consistent with the notion that ROR1Pos CLL cells had
enhanced activation of AKT signaling pathways, we found that ratios
of activated AKT (phosphorylated AKT) to total AKT in ROR1Pos
CLL were higher than those of ROR1Neg CLL samples. Such
differences were comparable to those noted between the ROR1Pos
leukemia of ROR1xTCL1 transgenic mice relative to the ROR1Neg
leukemia that develops in otherwise syngeneic TCL1 transgenic
mice.7 Moreover, the ROR1Pos leukemia of ROR1xTCL1 transgenic
mice had higher levels of activated AKT than the ROR1Neg leukemia
of TCL1 transgenic mice; this was associated with higher rates of
leukemia-cell proliferation and lower levels of spontaneous apopto-
sis, resulting in a more aggressive disease and shorter survival of
ROR1xTCL1 transgenic mice compared with TCL1 transgenic mice.
Wnt5a influences a variety of cellular functions, such as pro-
liferation, differentiation, migration, adhesion, and planar-cell polarity.

From 
 vitro system of coculture of CLL cells with HelaCD154 in media
containing IL-4/IL-10 and confirmed that Wnt5A could enhance the
proliferation CLL cells that express ROR1; this effect could be blocked
by treatment of the CLL cells with an anti-ROR1 mAb (UC-961,
cirmtuzumab).4 On the other hand, Wnt5a did not enhance the
proliferation of ROR1Neg samples, consistent with this effect being
dependent upon ROR1. The ROR1-dependent effects that Wnt5a has
on CLL cells in vitro infer that expression of ROR1 serves to stimulate
leukemia-cell survival, migration, and proliferation in vivo and thus
might influence disease progression.
That a high level of ROR1 expression may drive more aggressive
disease was suggested by the results of a prior study of 20 CLL patients
that found cases with progressive disease had higher frequencies of
ROR11 CLL cells than a matched number of CLL patients with
nonprogressive disease.20 Patients were considered to have progressive
disease if they had worsening disease-related anemia (hemoglobin
,10 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (,100 3 109/L), lymphadenopathy, or
doubling of the blood lymphocyte count in the preceding 3-month
period; patients were considered nonprogressive if they lacked these
criteria. However, 8 of the 10 CLL patients in the progressive disease
group had previously received treatment, whereas none of the patients
in the nonprogressive group had received therapy. As such, the authors
of this study acknowledged that the differences in the expression of
ROR1 between the 2 groups could have been the result of prior therapy
or disease duration. In the current study, we found that the relative
expression levels of ROR1 were not influenced by prior therapy
(supplemental Figure 6), suggesting that high levels of ROR1 per se
influence disease progression.
We thus examined whether high-level expression of ROR1 was
associated with accelerated disease progression among patients with
CLL. Randomly assigning cases to a training set or a validation
set allowed us to define a threshold for the ROR1 DMFI in the training
set that could then be applied to cases in the validation cohort to
determine whether it could be used to “predict” differences in the
clinical outcome. Consistent with the random assignment of cases to
either subset, we noted that distribution of the expression levels of
ROR1 were comparable between the training and validation cohorts
(supplemental Figure S7). Because there was no clear threshold with
which to segregate cases into subgroups with high vs low levels of
ROR1, we used the profile-likelihood method in a Cox regression
model based on TFS to define a ROR1 DMFI threshold that best could
segregatepatientsinthetrainingsetintoROR1-HivsROR1-Losubsets
that had different median TFS. This analysis defined an optimal ROR1
DMFI threshold of 32, which was considerably higher than the ROR1
DMFI of CLL cases considered ROR1Neg. As such, the ROR1-Lo
subgroup, which included 43% of the patients in the training cohort,
largely comprised samples that expressed some detectable, albeit low,
level of ROR1. Nevertheless, when this threshold was applied to
segregate samples in the validation cohort, we found that patients in the
ROR1-Hi subgroup had a significantly shorter median TFS and OS
than patients in the ROR1-Lo subgroup, even though OS was not used
todefinetheROR1DMFIthresholdusedtosegregatecasesintoROR1-
Hi or ROR1-Lo subgroups. This analysis indicates that quantitative
differences in ROR1 may influence clinical outcome and that, on
average, cases with low-level expression of ROR1 have a more indolent
clinical course than patients with high-level expression of this orphan
receptor.
Although high-level expression of ROR1 more often was
associated with use of U-IGHV, this association was not absolute.
Indeed, more than half of the cases with M-IGHV were classified
as ROR1-Hi. Furthermore, high-level expression of ROR1 was
associated with shorter TFS even when the IGHV mutation status
was factored into a multivariate model. The association of high-
level expression of ROR1 with adverse outcome was particularly
apparent for patients with CLL cells that use M-IGHV. Moreover,
high-level expression of ROR1 was associated with a significantly
shorter TFS and OS in patients with M-IGHV. However, for
patients with CLL that used U-IGHV, the differences in TFS did not
reach statistical significance, unless we performed the analysis on
the entire group of patients for whom we had IGHV sequence data.
Furthermore, we find that patients with CLL cells that use U-IGHV
and have low-level expression of ROR1 apparently have a shorter
TFS and OS than patients with CLL cells that use M-IGHV and
have high-level ROR1, indicating that high-level expression of
ROR1 cannot account for the relatively aggressive clinical course
already noted for patients with CLL cells that use U-IGHV.21,22 In
any case, we conclude that high-level expression of ROR1 is as-
sociated with more aggressive disease, indicating that ROR1 may
act as a driver of leukemia progression, as noted for ROR1xTCL1
transgenic mice.
The relationship between high-level expression of ROR1 and
adverse outcome also has been noted for malignancies other than CLL.
A variety of different cancers have been found to express ROR1.23 To
date, high-level expression of ROR1 has been found to have adverse
prognostic significance for patients with breast cancer,24-27 ovarian
cancer,28,29 melanoma,30 or Ewing sarcoma.31 Moreover, high-level
expression of ROR1 also has been associated with higher levels of
AKT activation,24,30,32,33 consistent with the notion that ROR1
signalingleadingtoactivationofAKTmay serveasa driver,not justin
CLL, but also in other malignancies. Because of this and its restricted
postpartum expression, ROR1 may be an attractive target for therapy
with either mAbs,7,34 or other agents that specifically inhibit this
orphan receptor and/or its downstream signaling pathways.
