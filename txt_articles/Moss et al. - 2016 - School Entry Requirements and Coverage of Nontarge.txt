BACKGROUND: Low human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination coverage is an urgent public 
health problem requiring action. To identify policy remedies to suboptimal HPV 
vaccination, we assessed the relationship between states’ school entry requirements and 
adolescent vaccination.
METHODS: We gathered data on states’ school entry requirements for adolescent vaccination 
(tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis [Tdap] booster; meningococcal; and HPV) from 2007 
to 2012 from Immunization Action Coalition. The National Immunization Survey–Teen 
provided medical record–verified vaccination data for 99 921 adolescents. We calculated 
coverage (among 13- to 17-year-olds) for individual vaccinations and concomitant 
vaccination. HPV vaccination outcomes were among female adolescents. Analyses used 
weighted longitudinal multivariable models.
RESULTS: States with requirements for Tdap booster and meningococcal vaccination 
had 22 and 24 percentage point increases in coverage for these vaccines, respectively, 
compared with other states (both P < .05). States with HPV vaccination requirements 
had <1 percentage point increase in coverage for this vaccine (P < .05). Tdap booster and 
meningococcal vaccination requirements, respectively, were associated with 8 and 4 
percentage point spillover increases for HPV vaccination coverage (both P < .05) and with 
increases for concomitant vaccination (all P < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: Ensuring all states have meningococcal vaccination requirements could improve 
the nation’s HPV vaccination coverage, given that many states already require Tdap booster 
but not meningococcal vaccination for school entry. Vaccination programs and clinicians 
should capitalize on changes in adolescent vaccination, including concomitant vaccination, 
that may arise after states adopt vaccination requirements. Additional studies are needed 
on the effects of HPV vaccination requirements and opt-out provisions.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Uptake of human 
papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is suboptimal, leaving many 
young people at risk for HPV-associated diseases. School 
entry vaccination requirements have increased coverage 
of other childhood and adolescent vaccines, but few states 
have adopted HPV vaccination requirements.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Requirements for other 
adolescent vaccines were associated with larger increases 
in HPV vaccination coverage than were HPV vaccination 
requirements. Concomitant vaccination may drive these 
patterns. Permissive opt-out provisions may make HPV 
vaccination requirements acceptable but may lessen their 
impact.

MOSS et al 
In 2005, the Advisory Committee 
on Immunization Practices in the 
United States began recommending 
that adolescents routinely receive 
tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis 
(Tdap) booster and meningococcal 
vaccines. 
1 In 2006 and 2011, 
the recommendations expanded 
to include 3 doses of human 
papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine 
for female and male adolescents, 
respectively. 
1 By 2014, coverage 
was high for Tdap booster (88%) 
and meningococcal vaccine (79%). 
2 
However, HPV vaccination lagged 
behind (<40% series completion). 
2 
These estimates mask variation 
between states; for example, HPV 
vaccine completion among girls 
ranged from 20% (Tennessee) to 
57% (Washington, DC).2 In 2014, the 
President’s Cancer Panel emphasized 
that increasing HPV vaccine 
completion to 80% nationally would 
prevent an additional 53 000 cases of 
cervical cancer in girls currently ≤12 
years old. 
3 This missed opportunity 
for cancer prevention has prompted 
efforts by federal agencies to improve 
HPV vaccination rates. 
3 
 
–6
State school entry requirements 
7 
for adolescent vaccination may help 
address persistently suboptimal 
HPV vaccination rates and explain 
existing variation in uptake across 
states. These policies require that 
adolescents receive vaccines before 
entering a particular grade, with 
exemptions allowed for medical 
and, in most states, religious or 
philosophical reasons. 
7 
– 
9 By the 2015 
school year, 47 states had adopted 
requirements for Tdap booster, 25 
states for meningococcal vaccine, and 
3 states for HPV vaccine completion.7 
The HPV vaccination requirements 
in Virginia and Washington, DC 
are remarkably lax, allowing 
parents to opt out of vaccination 
for any reason. 
10 Furthermore, 
these requirements target only 
female adolescents, even though 
national recommendations have 
recommended HPV vaccination for all 
adolescents since 2011. 
1
Vaccination requirements typically 
increase coverage for vaccines they 
target 
11 
 
 
–15 and can generate smaller 
spillover increases in coverage for 
nontargeted vaccines. 
16, 
 
17 Spillover 
effects may arise from concomitant 
vaccination (receipt of multiple 
vaccines during 1 health care visit). 
1, 
 
18 
Given the backlash against HPV 
vaccination requirements that has 
hindered their implementation, 
19 
 
– 
22 
spillover effects of requirements for 
other vaccines onto HPV vaccination 
could be important for public 
health. However, few studies have 
investigated the effects of HPV 
vaccination requirements. 
23, 
24 School 
entry vaccination requirements may 
also improve adolescent vaccination 
timeliness, or uptake at ages 11 or 
12, per national recommendations. 
1 
The vaccines are more effective in 
younger adolescents, 
 
1, 
 
25 but many 
adolescents receive them when they 
are ≥13 years old. 
4, 
26
The objective of our study was to 
evaluate targeted and spillover 
effects of school entry requirements 
on coverage and timeliness of 
individual and concomitant 
vaccination, with a special focus on 
HPV vaccination.
METHODS
Data Sources
Data on school entry vaccination 
requirements came from the 
Immunization Action Coalition, 
 
7, 
 
12, 
 
17 
which publishes information on 
vaccination requirements compiled 
from health departments in states 
and Washington, DC (hereafter 
referred to as “states”). The database 
indicates whether and when states 
adopted requirements for Tdap 
booster, meningococcal, or HPV 
vaccination.
Data on vaccination outcomes came 
from the National Immunization 
Survey–Teen (NIS-Teen), 
implemented by the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC). 
27 Each year, NIS-Teen 
interviewers administer telephone 
surveys to a population-based sample 
of caregivers of 13- to 17-year-old 
adolescents. Interviewers asked 
for consent to contact adolescents’ 
primary health care providers to 
verify vaccination history by using 
medical records. Since 2008, NIS-
Teen has collected medical record–
verified vaccination data for ~20 000 
adolescents annually. We examined 
data from the 2008 to 2012 NIS-Teen, 
for a total of 99 921 adolescents (an 
average of 392 adolescents per state, 
per year). 
27
Data collection for NIS-Teen was 
approved by the National Center for 
Health Statistics (NCHS) Research 
Ethics Review Board. Analysis of 
deidentified data from the survey is 
exempt from federal regulations for 
the protection of human research 
participants. Analysis of restricted 
data through the NCHS Research 
Data Center is also approved by the 
NCHS Research Ethics Review Board. 
The University of North Carolina 
Institutional Review Board exempted 
this study from review.
Measures
School Entry Vaccination Requirements
For each adolescent vaccine, 
we coded whether states had 
adopted school entry vaccination 
requirements by August 1 of each 
year (2007–2012).
Vaccination Outcomes
We calculated states’ yearly coverage 
for Tdap booster, meningococcal 
vaccination, and HPV vaccination 
(first dose among girls) for 13- to 
17-year-olds (2008–2012). 
28 
 
 
–32 We 
also calculated coverage for receipt 
of 2 vaccines concomitantly (on the 
same day 
18) for each combination of 
adolescent vaccines. As a secondary 
outcome, we measured timeliness,

received each vaccine by age 13 
(2008–2012).
As a supplementary outcome, 
we measured summer peaks in 
adolescent vaccination. 
33, 
 
34 Health 
care providers deliver a substantial 
portion of adolescent vaccinations 
between June and August, 
 
33 and 
vaccination requirements may 
amplify these summer peaks as 
parents hurry to comply before 
the school year begins. To measure 
summer peaks, we coded the month 
and year adolescents received 
their vaccinations and calculated 
the percentage of vaccine doses 
administered in June, July, and 
August 
33 (2008–2011). Because of 
small cell sizes, we did not analyze 
summer peaks for vaccines delivered 
in 2012.
Data Analysis
First, we estimated the mean of 
each vaccination outcome for states 
with and without each school 
entry requirement (collapsed over 
study years). We examined these 
outcomes for all states with a given 
vaccination requirement, regardless 
of their other requirements. For 
example, a state with a Tdap booster 
requirement may have had only that 
requirement, or it may have also had 
meningococcal and HPV vaccination 
requirements.
Next, we constructed multivariable 
generalized estimating equations 
to examine associations between 
the 3 vaccination requirements and 
each outcome. Because the effects 
of vaccination requirements may 
not have emerged in the same year 
as policy adoption (because of time 
needed for effects to spread through 
the population), we examined effects 
of vaccination requirements in a 
given year on outcomes in the next 
year. Our preliminary analyses found 
that 1-year lagged models better fit 
the observed data than nonlagged 
models (data not shown). Models 
also controlled for study year and 
the level of the outcome in previous 
years.
To examine the variance of 
requirements’ effects over time, we 
evaluated interaction terms for study 
year and school entry vaccination 
requirement. Because Wald tests 
showed no interactions (all were P > 
.05), we dropped these interactions 
from the models.
Estimates of vaccination outcomes 
incorporated NIS-Teen sampling 
weights to account for nonequal 
probability of selection. 
27 
Multivariable analyses were 
weighted by states’ NIS-Teen sample 
size. We excluded from analysis of 
vaccination timeliness and summer 
peaks any adolescent who did not 
receive the respective vaccines. 
For all outcomes that included HPV 
vaccine, we measured initiation of the 
3-dose series only among adolescent 
girls because CDC recommendations 
for routine administration in boys did 
not go into effect until 2011. 
35 We use 
the terms targeted and spillover to 
refer to associations between school 
entry vaccination requirements 
and outcomes for the vaccine 
named in the requirement versus 
all other vaccines, respectively. We 
implemented analyses in SAS version 
9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC). 
Statistical tests used a 2-tailed 
P value of .05.
RESULTS
Seven states had school entry 
requirements for Tdap booster 
in 2007, none for meningococcal 
vaccination, and none for HPV 
vaccination ( 
Table 1). By 2012, 
these figures had increased to 
42, 14, and 2 states, respectively. 
States’ vaccination requirements 
overlapped: In 2012, both states 
with HPV vaccination requirements 
also had meningococcal vaccination 
requirements, and all 14 states 
with meningococcal vaccination 
requirements also had Tdap booster 
requirements.
Vaccination Coverage
Tdap booster requirements had the 
intended effect: Coverage for the 
vaccine was 22 percentage points 
higher (95% confidence interval 
[CI], 17 to 27) in states with these 
requirements than in states without 
them ( 
Table 2) (77% vs 56%; 
Supplemental Table 4). In terms of 
spillover effects, HPV vaccination 
coverage was 8 percentage points 
higher in states with Tdap booster 
requirements ( 
Fig 1), and other 
vaccine coverage outcomes were 
4 to 15 percentage points higher. 
Multivariable analyses confirmed 
that Tdap booster requirements were 
associated with higher coverage for 
all vaccination outcomes (all P < 
.05). Supplemental Table 4 provide 
additional findings for vaccination 
coverage, timeliness, and summer 
peaks.
Meningococcal vaccination 
requirements also had the intended 
effect: coverage for the vaccine was 
24 percentage points higher (95% 
CI, 19 to 29) in states with these 
requirements than in states without 
them ( 
Table 2) (81% vs 57%; 
Supplemental Table 4). In terms of 
spillover effects, HPV vaccination 
was 4 percentage points higher ( 
Fig 
1), and coverage with other vaccines 
was 3 to 23 percentage points higher. 
Multivariable analyses confirmed 
that meningococcal vaccination 
requirements were associated with 
higher coverage for all vaccination 
outcomes (all P < .05).
However, HPV vaccination 
requirements did not act as expected. 
Coverage for the vaccine was <1 
percentage point higher (95% CI, −6 
to 7) in states with HPV vaccination 
requirements than in states without 
them ( 
Table 2;  
Fig 1) (47.7% vs 
47.3%; Supplemental Table 4). 
This difference in HPV vaccination 
coverage was small, but multivariable 
analyses confirmed that it was 
statistically significant (P < .05). HPV 
vaccination requirements were also 
associated with higher coverage for

Tdap booster but lower coverage 
for meningococcal vaccination 
and other vaccination outcomes in 
multivariable analyses.
Vaccination Timeliness
States with Tdap booster 
requirements had timely Tdap 
booster vaccination rates that 
were 25 percentage points greater 
(95% CI, 18 to 32) and timely HPV 
vaccination rates that were 12 
percentage points greater than states 
without Tdap booster requirements 
( 
Table 3). States with meningococcal 
vaccination requirements had timely 
meningococcal vaccination rates 
that were 27 percentage points 
greater (95% CI, 19 to 34) and timely 
HPV vaccination rates that were 9 
percentage points greater than states 
without meningococcal vaccination 
requirements ( 
Table 3). Multivariable 
analyses confirmed that Tdap booster 
and meningococcal vaccination 
requirements were associated with 
greater timeliness for all vaccination 
outcomes (P < .05).
Finally, states with HPV vaccination 
requirements had timely HPV 
vaccination rates that were 4 
percentage points greater (95% 
CI, −3 to 12) than states without 
the requirements ( 
Table 3). 
Multivariable analyses confirmed 
that HPV vaccination requirements 
were associated with greater 
timeliness for HPV vaccine, Tdap 
booster, meningococcal vaccine, and 
concomitant meningococcal and HPV 
vaccination, and lower timeliness for 
remaining outcomes (all P < .05).
Summer Peaks in Vaccination
In supplementary analyses, Tdap 
booster, meningococcal vaccine, and 
HPV vaccine requirements were 
associated with increases in summer 
peaks in all vaccination outcomes 
(P < .05; Supplemental Table 5). 
For example, summer peaks in HPV 
vaccination were 8 percentage points 
larger for states with Tdap booster 
requirements, 5 percentage points 
larger for states with meningococcal 
vaccination requirements, and 25 
percentage points larger for states 
with HPV vaccination requirements 
than for other states.
DISCUSSION
Adolescent school entry vaccination 
requirements were associated with 
improvements in coverage and 
timeliness in a 5-year, nationally 
representative study of ~100 000 
adolescents. Tdap booster and 
meningococcal vaccination 
requirements were effective at 
increasing coverage for the targeted 
vaccines and were associated with 
larger spillover increases in HPV 
vaccination coverage. In contrast, 
school entry HPV vaccination 
requirements for adolescent girls in 2 
jurisdictions had minimal impact on 
HPV vaccination coverage and may 
have led to poorer coverage for some 
other vaccination outcomes.
Previous studies have demonstrated 
similar but smaller increases in 
coverage with targeted vaccines 
for Tdap booster

requirements. In contrast to those 
studies, our analyses included a 
1-year lag and controlled for previous 
years’ coverage estimates to better 
establish the size and temporality 
of the relationships. Recent studies 
have found negligible or nonexistent 
differences in coverage from HPV 
vaccination requirements 
23, 
 
24; the 
statistically significant but very small 
increase in HPV vaccination coverage 
demonstrated in our study could 
have resulted from the large sample 
size.
Although these findings about 
HPV vaccination coverage may be 
counterintuitive, they make sense 
in the context of the weak HPV 
vaccination requirements in place at 
the time of our study. Only Virginia 
and Washington, DC 
10 enacted HPV 
vaccination requirements during the 
study period. These requirements 
covered adolescent girls only and 
allowed parents to opt out for any 
reason and with little effort, which 
has been associated with higher 
rates of nonmedical exemptions for 
other vaccination requirements. 
36 
Adoption of stronger HPV vaccination 
requirements in other states could 
have different implications for HPV 
vaccination coverage. For example, in 
2015 Rhode Island adopted an HPV 
vaccination school entry requirement 
for all adolescents, with opt-out 
allowed only for medical or religious 
reasons. 
37 The requirement has faced 
ongoing public opposition, 
 
37 despite 
the high rates of HPV vaccination 
in the state before the requirement 
went into effect.2 It will be important 
to monitor HPV vaccination coverage 
in Rhode Island among male and 
female adolescents in the coming 
years.
School entry vaccination 
requirements were also associated 
with spillover increases in 
HPV vaccination coverage (4–8 
percentage points) that were much 
larger than the modest increase 
associated with requirements

targeting HPV vaccination (<1 
percentage point). HPV vaccination 
requirements were also associated 
with spillover decreases in coverage 
for some of the other outcomes. 
Future studies should attempt 
to explain these decreases, but a 
potential mechanism may be that 
parents’ reactance 
38 against HPV 
vaccination requirements spread to 
other vaccines. Previous studies have 
demonstrated the spillover effects of 
Tdap booster requirements, 
 
11, 
 
16, 
 
17 
but to our knowledge no other 
studies have investigated spillover 
effects of meningococcal and HPV 
vaccination requirements.
Policymakers should consider 
changing school entry requirements 
to increase HPV vaccination 
coverage. First, we believe that 
states should consider an indirect 
approach of adopting Tdap booster 
or meningococcal vaccination 
requirements. All but 2 states 
now have Tdap booster vaccination 
requirements, but many states have 
not yet adopted meningococcal 
vaccination requirements. 
7 Adoption 
of the latter requirement may be 
a promising way to increase HPV 
vaccination and meningococcal 
vaccination coverage. Second, states 
with school entry requirements 
already in place for Tdap booster 
and meningococcal vaccination 
could restrict opt-out provisions. 
More generous opt-out provisions 
are associated with higher rates 
of exemption, lower vaccination 
coverage, and higher disease 
incidence. 
36, 
 
39 Finally, policymakers 
could try to increase HPV vaccination 
coverage more directly by adopting 
HPV vaccination requirements, which 
may or may not be politically feasible 
and effective. The impact of HPV 
vaccination requirements for both 
boys and girls and with less lenient 
opt-out provisions remains to be 
established, but strict requirements 
for the vaccine are unpalatable to the 
majority of parents. 
40
In addition, school entry vaccination 
requirements were associated with 
more timely adolescent vaccination. 
Most requirements target students 
entering the sixth or seventh grade, 
 
7 
when adolescents are typically 
ages 11 or 12, which coincides with 
national recommendations about 
age of vaccination. 
1 Vaccination 
requirements may provide an 
additional incentive for parents 
to seek timely vaccination for 
their adolescents. Tdap booster 
and meningococcal vaccination 
requirements had larger spillover 
effects on HPV vaccination 
timeliness than the targeted 
association between HPV vaccination 
requirements and timeliness for 
that vaccine. Thus, all vaccination 
requirements improved the rate of 
timely adolescent vaccination, but 
Tdap booster and meningococcal 
vaccination requirements were 
particularly effective.
Finally, school entry vaccination 
requirements were associated 
with larger summer (June to 
August) peaks in vaccination. 
33 
This association was particularly 
striking for the jurisdictions with 
HPV vaccination requirements. In 
states without these requirements, 
health care providers administered 
53% of (initial) HPV vaccine 
doses in the summer, but in 
states with these requirements, 
providers administered 78% of 
HPV vaccine doses in the summer. 
Thus, interventions that disrupt 
clinical practice during the summer 
could be especially problematic 
for vaccination, but education or 
promotion campaigns could be 
especially successful at that time. 
Providers can prepare for increased 
summer demand for vaccinations 
after a state adopts a vaccination 
requirement through initiatives to 
increase efficiency, such as adopting 
standing orders for recommended 
vaccines 
41 and focusing on offering 
concomitant administration of 
HPV vaccine during periods when 
Tdap booster and meningococcal 
vaccination are at their peak.
Study strengths include a large 
sample size from a high-quality, 
national data set. 
27 Health care 
providers verified vaccination status 
and dates, increasing our confidence 
in the validity of these measures. 
Previous studies of school entry 
vaccination requirements have 
focused on the associations between 
Tdap booster requirements and 
coverage, but we also investigated

meningococcal and HPV vaccination 
requirements, other vaccination 
outcomes (timeliness and summer 
peaks), spillover effects, and 
concomitant vaccination. We used 
a longitudinal design to disentangle 
the temporal relationships between 
study variables, and we examined 
the consistency of these relationships 
over time.
Study limitations include the 
observational nature of our study; 
we could not eliminate all potential 
confounders. Particularly important 
is unmeasured confounding by other 
factors related to vaccination, such 
as demographics or norms around 
health care policies. Additionally, 
vaccination requirements within 
states were correlated. We addressed 
this issue by implementing 
multivariable models controlling 
for other school entry vaccination 
requirements. Differences in 
vaccination outcomes represent 
population-level averages at the 
study midpoint (2010); thus, for 
meningococcal and HPV vaccination 
school entry requirements (which 
were uncommon before 2010), the 
magnitude of the differences may be 
underestimated. Because of small cell 
sizes, we could not analyze summer 
peaks in vaccination for 2012. 
Similarly, the sample size within a 
given cell was small, particularly 
for HPV vaccination, which was 
measured only among female 
adolescents. With continuing data 
collection, future studies can evaluate 
the relationships described here with 
more precision. We did not evaluate 
HPV vaccination among male 
adolescents, which is an important 
endpoint for future studies.
CONCLUSIONS
Tdap booster and meningococcal 
vaccination school entry 
requirements were consistently 
associated with higher coverage, 
greater timeliness, and larger 
summer peaks for targeted and

spillover vaccinations. These 
findings highlight potential policy 
interventions to continue improving 
adolescent vaccination rates. Given 
the low rates of HPV vaccination and 
the political difficulties in adopting 
school entry requirements for 
this vaccine, 
 
19 
 
– 
22 the associations 
between Tdap booster and 
meningococcal vaccination 
requirements and HPV vaccination 
outcomes are especially important. 
Absent strong HPV vaccination 
school entry requirements, adopting 
Tdap booster or meningococcal 
vaccination requirements may lead 
to the greatest improvements in 
HPV vaccination among the policy 
interventions evaluated in the 
current study. These requirements 
may be even more influential for 
HPV vaccination coverage than 
HPV vaccination requirements 
with generous opt-out provisions. 
Because almost all states now 
have Tdap requirements, 
more widespread adoption of 
meningococcal vaccination school 
entry requirements could have 
the most positive impact on HPV 
vaccination. Leveraging school entry 
requirements to improve vaccination 
rates can have implications for 
herd immunity, herd severity, 
42 
and protecting the population from 
vaccine-preventable infectious and 
chronic diseases.
