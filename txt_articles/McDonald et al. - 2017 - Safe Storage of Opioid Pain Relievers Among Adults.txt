abstract
OBJECTIVES: To describe safe storage practices and beliefs among adults who have used a 
prescription opioid pain reliever (OPR) in the past year; to compare practices and beliefs 
among those living with younger (<7 years) versus older children (7–17 years).
METHODS: A survey was administered to a nationally representative sample of adults 
reporting OPR use in the previous 12 months and who had children <18 years old living 
with them. We used Health Belief Model–derived items to measure beliefs. Safe storage 
was defined as locked or latched for younger children and as locked for older children. 
Regression models examined the association between beliefs and safe storage practices.
RESULTS: Among 681 adults who completed our survey and reported having children in 
their home, safe storage was reported by 32.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 21.4–43.8) 
of those with only young children, 11.7% (95% CI, 7.2–16.2) among those with only older 
children, and 29.0% (95% CI, 18.3–39.8) among those with children in both age groups. 
Among those asked to answer survey questions thinking about only their oldest child, the 
odds of reporting safe storage decreased by half as perceived barriers increased (0.505; 
95% CI, 0.369–0.692), increased twofold as efficacy increased (2.112; 95% CI, 1.390–3.210), 
and increased (1.728; 95% CI, 1.374–2.174) as worry increased.
CONCLUSIONS: OPRs are stored unsafely in many households with children. Educational 
messages should address perceived barriers related to safe storage while emphasizing how 
it may reduce OPR access among children.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: The United 
States is in the midst of an opioid epidemic. Opioids 
are increasingly implicated in unintentional 
ingestions among young children. Overdose fatalities 
related to opioid exposures have more than doubled 
among adolescents and young adults.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This study demonstrates 
that opioid pain reliever (OPR) storage is suboptimal 
in households with children and adolescents despite 
most respondents reporting high perceived threats 
from OPRs and despite high perceived benefi
 ts and 
low perceived barriers to safe OPR storage.

The opioid epidemic in the United 
States is a complex problem. National 
surveys suggest that almost 2 million 
people start opioid pain relievers 
(OPRs) annually, 
 
1 and in 2012 health 
care providers wrote 259 million 
OPR prescriptions. 
2 In 2014, >10 
million people reported using OPRs 
nonmedically. 
3 Problematic OPR use 
has been linked to heroin use and to 
the rapid increase in drug poisoning 
deaths in this country. 
4, 
5
Children and adolescents are 
at risk for unintentional and 
intentional exposure as a result 
of OPRs’ pervasive presence in 
US households. Burghardt et al 
6 
demonstrated an association 
between adult prescription drug 
use and pediatric medication 
poisonings between 2000 and 2009, 
with the greatest risk for children 
<6 years old. Among children this 
age who were hospitalized because 
of an unintentional ingestion, 
opioids were the most commonly 
implicated prescription medication. 
7 
Nonmedical use among adolescents is 
also problematic. The 2014 National 
Survey on Drug Use and Health 
3 
indicated that the second most 
common illicit drug use category 
among those 12 to 17 years old, 
after marijuana, was OPRs. Overdose 
fatalities from drug exposures more 
than doubled among adolescents 
and young adults between 1999 and 
2008. 
5
Efforts to protect children from 
medication-related poisonings have 
used both policy and educational 
approaches. The Poison Prevention 
Packaging Act of 1970, which requires 
special packaging to render access 
to hazardous substances difficult 
for young children, has been a 
major policy success. 
8, 
 
9 Professional 
groups and organizations endorse 
educational messages that support 
locking or latching medicines and 
other household products implicated 
in pediatric poisonings, 
 
10 
–12 
despite the absence of clinical trials 
documenting their efficacy. For 
example, the Institute of Medicine 
recommends that programs distribute 
cabinet latches and advise parents to 
lock up medications. 
10 This combined 
approach was recently shown, in a 
network meta-analysis, to increase 
poison prevention practices in 
households with children. 
13
Limited national data exist to assess 
awareness of OPR dangers among 
adults with children living in the 
home or to examine storage beliefs 
and practices among this group. 
14 
Our larger study 
15 addressed this 
gap with data from a nationally 
representative sample of US adults 
who reported OPR use in the past 12 
months, regardless of the presence 
of children in the home; this study 
focuses exclusively on respondents 
with children in the home. To 
understand modifiable beliefs 
related to OPR storage, we applied 
the Health Belief Model (HBM) as 
the organizing framework to identify 
correlates of storage practices. 
16, 
 
17 
Used to understand many other 
health issues, 
18, 
 
19 the HBM asserts 
that a health-related behavior is 
determined after consideration of 
the health threat (measured as the 
perceived severity and susceptibility 
of the health problem), and the 
benefits and barriers to adopting the 
protective behavior. 
20 Self-efficacy, or 
confidence in one’s ability to engage 
in the desired behavior, and cues to 
action are other important constructs 
of the HBM. 
21 Because prescription 
drug poisoning has historically been 
treated as a concern primarily for 
adults with very young children, 
we hypothesized that respondents 
with only older children would have 
less protective beliefs and practices 
compared with those with younger 
children. We also hypothesized that 
adults’ safe storage practices would 
be associated with higher perceived 
benefits, threats, and self-efficacy 
and lower perceived barriers to 
safe storage. Furthermore, we 
hypothesized that respondents aware 
of a specific child’s death due to 
OPRs, referred to as a “cue to action” 
in the HBM, would be more likely to 
report safe storage practices because 
of the greater salience of the issue 
compared with those without this 
experience.
In this article, we examine the 
prevalence of safe storage practices 
among respondents, how storage 
practices and beliefs vary among 
respondents with younger versus 
older children in the home, and how 
beliefs may influence safe storage 
practices in both of these groups. 
Understanding OPR beliefs and 
storage practices can help inform 
pediatric anticipatory guidance and 
educational campaigns to better 
protect children and adolescents.
METHODS
GfK Group’s KnowledgePanel is a 
probability-based Web panel that 
recruits from a sampling frame 
encompassing 97% of US households 
and has been used to assess public 
opinions on various health issues. 
22 
– 
24 
We randomly selected a nationally 
representative sample of 4836 
adults >18 years old from the panel, 
oversampling households with 
children <18 years old. A screening 
question identified those who 
reported having used a prescription 
pain medication in the past 12 
months. Throughout the survey, we 
used the term “prescription pain 
medication” to refer to OPRs as a 
means of facilitating comprehension 
among respondents by reproducing 
the conventional language used 
in media coverage. 
25 OPRs were 
described to differentiate them from 
nonprescription pain medications 
(eg, Tylenol); respondents could view 
a list of generic and trademarked 
OPRs (Supplemental Information 
A). A $5 cash equivalent was earned 
for completing the survey, which 
was fielded between February 24 
and March 16, 2015. Sample size 
was designed to ensure that we had 
adequate power to detect differences

between groups of respondents with 
older (7–17 years old) and younger 
children (<1–6 years old) living in 
the household. With a sample size of 
681, we had >80% power to detect 
differences in proportions of 8% 
between 2 subgroups with 95% 
confidence. This study was approved 
as exempt by the authors’ university’s 
institutional review board.
GfK provided data on respondents’ 
sociodemographic characteristics, 
including respondents’ age, sex, 
marital status, education, race, 
and household income. We also 
collected information on age and sex 
of each child in the home and the 
respondent’s relationship to them (ie, 
parent or guardian).
Twelve survey items captured OPR 
HBM constructs. Because beliefs 
may vary by ages of children in 
respondents’ homes, respondents 
with >1 child were randomly 
assigned (via random group 
assignment indicator) to receive 
instructions to think about their 
oldest or youngest child in the home 
when responding to these items. 
These items assessed perceived 
threat of OPRs (3 items), perceived 
benefits of safe storage (3 items), 
perceived barriers to safe storage 
(3 items), perceived self-efficacy of 
safe storage (1 item), worry about 
OPRs (1 item), and cue to action (ie, 
aware of child death from OPR) (1 
item) (Supplemental Information B). 
The order of these 6 constructs was 
randomized to mitigate the impact 
of question order on responses. 
Respondents’ agreement with 
individual items was measured on 
a 7-point Likert scale anchored by 
7, strongly agree, and 1, strongly 
disagree. For descriptive analyses, 
responses 6 and 7 were collapsed 
as agree, 3 to 5 as neutral, and 1 and 
2 as disagree. We collapsed several 
items into 3 distinct scales, based on 
factor analysis, and used mean scale 
scores in models. These were the 
perceived threats scale (Cronbach’s 
α = .66), perceived benefits scale 
(Cronbach’s α = .82), and perceived 
barriers scale (Cronbach’s α = .83). 
Factor analysis did not indicate that 
items assessing respondents’ level 
of worry about child’s OPR access, 
self-efficacy related to safe storage 
of OPRs (eg, confidence in their 
ability to safely store OPRs), and cue 
to action (eg, awareness of a child’s 
death caused by OPRs) loaded onto a 
factor shared with other items. These 
items were retained as individual 
measures.
The safe storage practice outcome 
variable was measured with a 
7-point Likert scale that assessed 
the frequency (always to never) with 
which OPRs were kept in a locked 
location or in a latched location. For 
respondents with only a younger 
child (<1–6 years) in the home or 
randomly assigned to think about a 
younger child when responding to 
questions about their OPR beliefs, 
we defined safe storage as locking 
or latching the medication always or 
almost always. Among respondents 
with only an older child (7–17 years) 
in the home or randomly assigned 
to think about an older child, we 
defined safe storage as locking the 
medication always or almost always.
Using Stata (Stata Corp, College Station, 
TX), 
 
14, 
 
26 we calculated descriptive 
statistics (frequencies, means, and 
proportions) and used χ2 tests to 
assess differences in prevalence of 
safe storage practices among those

with only young children, those with 
only older children, and those with 
children in both age groups. Next, we 
used descriptive statistics to examine 
responses to the health belief items and 
t tests to assess differences between 
respondents who were instructed to 
think about their younger compared 
with their older child (regardless of 
whether they had children in both age 
groups in their homes).
To test the relationship between 
respondents’ health beliefs and their 
odds of engaging in safe storage 
behaviors, we estimated logistic 
regression models. In the first model, 
we included only health beliefs as 
covariates. In the second model, we 
added respondent characteristics 
that could be potential confounders, 
including age, sex, educational 
attainment, whether respondent 
lived with partner or spouse, race 
and ethnicity, household income, 
residence in metropolitan statistical 
area, region of country, current use 
of OPR at time of survey, number of 
children, age of child about which 
respondent was thinking when 
answering health beliefs items, and 
whether respondent was parent or 
guardian of child. Separate models 
were estimated for respondents 
randomly assigned to answer about 
their younger or older child, and 
we included a variable indicating 
whether there were children in both 
age groups in the household. Survey 
weights were applied to all analyses 
to account for sampling design and 
nonresponse.
RESULTS
Among 4836 adults sampled, 67.8% 
were screened for past-year OPR use; 
97.8% of those eligible (N = 1055) 
completed the survey (N = 1032), and 
681 had children in the home. We 
display the characteristics of the study 
sample, adults with past-year OPR 
use and children in the home, in  
Table 
1. The mean number of children in 
respondents’ household was 1.9 (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 1.8–2.0).
Safe storage of OPRs was reported 
among 32.6% (95% CI, 21.4%–43.8%) 
of respondents with only young 
children, 11.7% (95% CI, 7.2%–16.2%) 
among those with only older children, 
and 29.0% (95% CI, 18.3%–39.8%) 
among those with children in both 
age groups ( 
Fig 1). Respondents 
considering a younger child had a 
significantly higher mean perceived 
threats scale score (6.2; 95% CI, 6.1–
6.4 vs 5.7; 95% CI, 5.5–5.8) compared 
with respondents considering an 
older child ( 
Table 2). Although 72.6% 
of all respondents agreed with the 
statement, “Children can overdose on 
OPRs more easily than adults, 
” those 
considering a younger compared 
with an older child had a significantly 
higher mean score on this item 
(6.3; 95% CI, 6.0–6.5 vs 5.8; 95% CI, 
5.6–6.0). Although three-quarters of 
all respondents agreed that “Children 
who take an adult’s OPRs can suffer 
serious health consequences, 
” those 
considering a younger versus older 
child scored significantly higher on this 
item (6.4; 95% CI, 6.2–6.6 vs 6.0; 95% 
CI, 5.8–6.2). A slight majority (59.1%) 
of all respondents agreed, “Even a 
small amount of OPRs could kill my 
child, 
” although again, respondents 
thinking about a younger versus an 
older child had a significantly higher 
mean score (6.0; 95% CI, 5.8–6.2 vs 5.2; 
95% CI, 4.9–5.4).
For perceived benefits of safe 
storage, respondents considering 
younger versus older children had a 
significantly higher scale score (6.0; 
95% CI, 5.8–6.3 vs 5.5; 95% CI, 5.5–
5.7). Almost 70% of all respondents 
agreed that storing OPRs in a locked 
place “is a good way to keep my child 
from getting the medication” and 
“would prevent my child’s friends 
from getting the medication”; only 
the first of these items differed 
significantly between the 2 groups, 
with respondents thinking about a 
younger versus an older child having 
a higher mean score (6.2; 95% CI, 
5.9–6.4 vs 5.6; 95% CI, 5.4–5.9). 
Overall, 56.6% agreed that storing 
OPRs in a locked place would give 
them peace of mind about their child’s 
safety, with respondents considering 
their younger child versus older child

scoring significantly higher (5.8; 95% 
CI, 5.6–6.1 vs 5.1; 95% CI, 4.8–5.3).
The mean scale scores for perceived 
barriers to safe storage were 
significantly lower for those thinking 
about a younger child compared with 
an older child (2.9; 95% CI, 2.6–3.2 
vs 3.5; 95% CI, 3.2–3.7). Overall, few 
respondents agreed that storing OPRs 
in a locked place “is more trouble than 
it’s worth” (15.2%), “would make it too 
hard to use the medication” (15.7%), 
and “takes too much time” (16.9%). 
“Neutral” responses to these 3 barrier 
questions were reported by 38% to 
44% of respondents ( 
Table 2). Among 
the single-item scales, only worry 
significantly differed between those 
thinking about younger versus older 
children (3.0; 95% CI, 2.7–3.4 vs 2.4; 
95% CI, 2.2–2.7).
Among respondents considering a 
younger child, none of the health 
belief measures were significantly 
associated with likelihood of reporting 
safe storage practices in adjusted 
regression analyses ( 
Table 3). Among 
respondents considering an older child, 
the odds of reporting safe storage were 
reduced by half as perceived barrier 
scale scores increased (0.505; 95% 
CI, 0.369–0.692), increased twofold 
as self-efficacy increased (2.112; 
95% CI, 1.390–3.210), and increased 
(1.728; 95% CI, 1.374–2.174) as worry 
increased in the adjusted regression 
analyses.
DISCUSSION
Results from this study indicate that 
the majority of homes with children 
where OPRs were used in the past 
year are reporting unsafe storage. 
One-third (32.6%) of respondents 
with children ages ≤6 years in the 
household reported storing their 
OPRs in a place that locked or 
latched, and only 11.7% of those with 
children ages 7 to 17 stored them 
in a locked place. These results are 
only slightly better than the 9% of

Survey weights were applied to account for survey sampling design.
a Respondents’ agreement with each item was measured on a 7-point Likert scale anchored by 7, strongly agree and 1, 
strongly disagree. Responses 6 and 7 were collapsed as agree, 
 3–5 as neutral, 
 and 1 and 2 as disagree.
b When respondents had only young (<1–6 y) or older (7–17 y) children, they were instructed to think about that child when 
responding to survey questions. Respondents with children in both age groups were randomly assigned to think about 
either their youngest or oldest child when answering these questions.
c Scales were derived from combined individual items for perceived benefi
 ts, perceived barriers, and perceived threats, 
and mean scale scores were calculated.

all households that reported safely 
storing OPRs in our larger survey 
that included households with and 
without children. 
15 Our current 
results also found that respondents 
thinking about older versus younger 
children consistently reported lower 
perceptions of threats, benefits, 
and worry and higher perceptions 
of barriers. Taken together, these 
results allow us to accept our 
hypothesis that respondents with 
older children have less protective 
beliefs and practices compared with 
those with younger children. We 
also hypothesized, and our results 
confirmed for those referring to an 
older child, that safe storage was 
associated with lower perceptions 
of barriers and higher perceptions 
of self-efficacy and worry. This 
association was not seen for those 
responding about younger children. 
Knowledge of a child’s death due 
to OPRs was unrelated to storage 
practices; therefore, we rejected 
our hypothesis that assumed an 
association between them.
Pediatric care providers are uniquely 
positioned to use these findings to 
guide anticipatory guidance and 
patient education. General pediatric 
poison prevention anticipatory 
guidance is well established and 
includes recommending that 
medicines and other household 
poisons be locked up. 
27 The high 
proportion of “neutral” responses to 
many of the HBM items we observed 
suggests that a large number of 
parents have not yet formed opinions 
about OPRs and the need for safe 
storage. Although more study is 
warranted, there is an urgent need 
for more or better public information, 
including age-specific anticipatory 
guidance. For households with older 
children, our results suggest that safe 
storage practices increase when the 
perceived barriers to doing so are 
reduced. Pediatricians’ anticipatory 
guidance should address perceptions 
of barriers to safe storage while 
reinforcing adults’ efficacy to safely 
store OPRs. As has been shown with 
other safety products, making storage 
devices available through clinic- or 
hospital-based safety resource 
centers is an effective method for 
increasing adoption of them. 
28
Although the OPRs reported in 
our sample belonged to the adult, 
their presence in the home and 
how they are stored are relevant 
data for pediatricians. A recent 
study 
29 reported a 165% increase 
in hospitalizations for prescription 
opioids among those ages 1 to 19 
years between 1997 and 2012; the 
study did not document whether the 
prescription was for the hospitalized 
child or some other household 
member. Some adolescents believe 
that because a doctor prescribes 
OPRs, they are safe for nonmedical 
use. 
30 Both adults and adolescents 
need to be educated about the 
association between nonmedical 
prescription drug use and risk of 
opioid use disorder. 
4, 
 
31 Pediatricians 
can educate adults with older 
children about the addiction and 
overdose risks of access to their 
OPRs for nonmedical use by their 
children or their friends. Existing 
materials may be helpful for these 
discussions, 
32, 
 
33 although more 
research is needed to demonstrate 
the impact of such interventions on 
behavioral and health outcomes.
The present findings should be 
interpreted in the context of the 
study’s limitations. Approximately 
one-third of those screened into 
the study reported OPR use in the 
past year, which is higher than the 
national average of 4% to 6%. 
34 
We relied on self-reported storage 
practices; therefore, our findings 
could be subject to social desirability 
bias. However, this would mean 
that our results overestimate the 
proportion of households safely 
storing OPRs, making our results 
even more concerning. Social 
desirability could also influence 
reported beliefs, although our 
concern about this bias is lessened 
by the large proportion of “neutral” 
responses, the variability in 
responses, and the relationships 
between beliefs and behaviors that 
were found for those with older 
children. Another potential limitation 
is our construction of the younger 
and older age groupings of children

Separate logistic regression models were estimated for each model. Survey weights were applied to account for survey 
sampling design.
a Safe storage of opioid pain relievers was defi
 ned as always or almost always storing the medication in a place that 
is locked or latched for those responding about a young child (<1–6 y) and as always or almost always storing the 
medication in place that is locked for those responding about an older child (7–17 y).
b Model 2 adjusts for respondents’ age, sex, educational attainment, whether living with partner or spouse, race and 
ethnicity, household income, residence in metropolitan statistical area, region of country, whether respondent was still 
using OPR at time of survey, number of children, age of child about which respondent was thinking when answering health 
belief questions, whether the respondent is parent or guardian of the child, and whether there are both younger and 
older children in the household. Characteristics were entered into the model under the same categorization as in  
Table 1.

to assess health beliefs. This grouping 
may not accurately reflect how adults 
with children in the home determine 
OPR storage practices. Our age cutoff 
point was based on both sample 
size considerations and children’s 
developmental capabilities related 
to accessing medications. Because 
we used the more conservative 
definition (ie, locked) of safe storage 
in all our HBM items, we may not 
have accurately assessed beliefs 
among the respondents reporting 
on younger children (where latching 
OPRs was also considered safe). Our 
research was not intended to fully 
explain all the factors influencing 
parents’ safe storage practices but 
rather to describe current storage 
practices and salient beliefs to 
help inform public education and 
anticipatory guidance. There may 
well be additional barriers that we 
did not assess, and more research is 
warranted to better understand what 
influences adults’ OPR storage beliefs 
and practices.
CONCLUSIONS
OPRs are pervasive in US 
households, including among 
households with children, and 
storage practices in these homes 
are suboptimal. Unsafe OPR storage 
contributes to the potential for 
children of all ages to be harmed, 
either through unintentional 
poisoning by younger children or 
nonmedical use raising the risk of 
addiction or overdose among older 
children. Public health campaigns 
and pediatric anticipatory guidance 
should address perceived barriers 
related to safe storage while 
emphasizing how it may reduce 
unintentional and intentional 
exposure to OPRs among children. 
More research is needed to identify 
the most effective means of storing 
OPRs and of promoting their 
adoption in homes with children of 
all ages.
