Abstract
Background: Resident stem and progenitor cells have been identified in the lung over the last decade, but isolation
and culture of these cells remains a challenge. Thus, although these lung stem and progenitor cells provide an ideal
source for stem-cell based therapy, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) remain the most popular cell therapy product for
the treatment of lung diseases. Surgical lung biopsies can be the tissue source but such procedures carry a high
risk of mortality.
Methods: In this study we demonstrate that therapeutic lung cells, termed “lung spheroid cells” (LSCs) can be
generated from minimally invasive transbronchial lung biopsies using a three-dimensional culture technique. The
cells were then characterized by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Angiogenic potential was tested by
in-vitro HUVEC tube formation assay. In-vivo bio- distribution of LSCs was examined in athymic nude mice after
intravenous delivery.
Results: From one lung biopsy, we are able to derive >50 million LSC cells at Passage 2. These cells were characterized
by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry and were shown to represent a mixture of lung stem cells and
supporting cells. When introduced systemically into nude mice, LSCs were retained primarily in the lungs for up
to 21 days.
Conclusion: Here, for the first time, we demonstrated that direct culture and expansion of human lung progenitor cells
from pulmonary tissues, acquired through a minimally invasive biopsy, is possible and straightforward with a
three-dimensional culture technique. These cells could be utilized in long-term expansion of lung progenitor
cells and as part of the development of cell-based therapies for the treatment of lung diseases such as
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

Background
The lung is a highly complex organ; it is responsible for
respiration but it also acts as a barrier to exterior patho-
gens and pollutants. It’s composed of over forty different
cell types that make up the three major pulmonary re-
gions: tracheobronchial, intralobar airway, and alveolar.
The adult lung is a highly quiescent organ; however,
after injury or irritation the lung has a remarkable abil-
ity to regenerate. Therefore the lung is considered an
organ with “facultative” stem/progenitor cell populations
[1, 2]. Thanks to lineage tracing, three main stem/pro-
genitor cell populations have been established in the
lung. These coordinate the maintenance and regener-
ation in the three main pulmonary regions [3].
In the proximal trachea, basal cells maintain and give
rise to club cells and ciliated cells [4–7]. The club cells
found throughout the airway are able to self-renew as
well as give rise to ciliated cells. Together the basal and

 club cells are responsible for maintaining the bronchi-
olar epithelium [8, 9]. The alveolar epithelium is primar-
ily maintained by alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, which also
have the ability to self-renew and give rise to alveolar
type 1 (AT1) cells [10–14]. Under certain conditions
club and AT1 cells can de-differentiate back into basal
and AT2 cells, respectively [8, 13]. This plasticity makes
the lung a good source of therapeutic cells to treat lung
disease, but isolation and study of lung stems cells has
been extremely difficult, due in large part to the organ’s
heterogeneity and complexity.
Cell-based therapy for lung disease has been primarily
focused on the use of non-resident stem cells, particu-
larly mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), due to their
immunoprivileged properties [15–20]. However, MSCs
have a very low rate of engraftment in the lungs, as well
as a low rate of differentiation into lung cells [21–23],
due at least in part to the fact that these cells are extrin-
sic to the lung. The use of resident lung stem/progenitor
cells for cell-based therapy would have a great advantage
due to the cells' inherent ability to engraft and survive in
a familiar environment. The development of a method(s)
to utilize these cells for this purpose would be invalu-
able. The multicellular spheroid method has been used
before to generate cardiac stem cells with therapeutic
potential [24, 25]. We have previously demonstrated
that regenerative lung spheroid cells (LSCs) could be
derived from healthy lung donor tissues, and that these
cells have disease-mitigating properties in a mouse
model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis [26, 27].
However, obtaining lung tissues from patients is not a triv-
ial task. Surgical lung biopsies can provide a large amount
of lung tissue, but such procedures are associated with
high mortality (3–28%) [28]. In contrast, the transbron-
chial biopsy procedure is much safer (0.20% mortality)
[29], but the amount of tissue recovered from each trans-
bronchial biopsy is very limited, and it is unknown
whether lung spheroid cells can be derived from this pro-
cedure. Therefore, in this study, we sought to develop a
rapid and efficient method to derive therapeutic lung spher-
oid cells from minimally invasive lung biopsies. We com-
pared LSCs derived from transbronchial biopsies and whole
lung tissues for their growth potentials and phenotypes.
Methods
Cell Culture
Human LSCs were generated from whole lung (WL) and
transbronchial (TB) samples and expanded as described
[30]. Briefly, tissue samples were washed with phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) (Life Technologies), followed by
enzymatic digestion at 37 °C in 5 mg/mL collagenase IV
solution (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 minutes. Iscove’s Modified
Dulbecco’s Media (IMDM; Life Technologies) containing
20% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Corning) was then added to
the sample to inactivate the collagenase. The tissue sam-
ples were further minced into smaller tissue explants
(~0.5 × 0.5 mm). Approximately 15–50 pieces of tissue
explants were then placed onto a fibronectin-coated plate
with approximately 1.5 cm between each explant, and cov-
ered with 2 mL of IMDM with 20% FBS overnight. The
cultures were maintained in IMDM with 20% FBS and
media change was performed every other day. In about
seven days, cells started to grow out from the tissue ex-
plants. Once these outgrowth cells were about 70–80%
confluent, usually around day 17–25, they were harvested
after 5–10 minutes of incubation with TryPLE Select™
(Life Technologies). The cells were then seeded into an
Ultra-Low attachment flask (Corning) at a density of
100,000 cells/cm2 and cultured in IMDM with 10% FBS.
Phase-bright lung spheroids started to form in 5–7 days.
Lung spheroids were then collected from the low-
attachment flasks and re-plated onto fibronectin-coated
surfaces to produce adherent LSCs. LSCs were cultured in
IMDM with 20% FBS media and passaged every 5–7 days.
We used passage 2–5 LSCs for all in-vitro and in-vivo
testing. Bronchia/trachea epithelial cell growth medium
(Sigma-Aldrich; 511–500) was used for testing effects of
media on cell markers.
Cell population doubling
We started with a known amount of cells plated to a flask.
On the next passage, cells are counted and the amount was
compared to the original cell count plated. Using these
numbers and the known amount of time in between the cell
counts, the rate of population doubling can be calculated.
This process was repeated for each passage of cells. The fol-
lowing equation was used: log
cell count at end passage
cell count at plating

Flow cytometry
Cells were washed with MACS flow buffer (MACS, 130-
091-222) and permeabilized with BD Cytofix/Cytoperm
(BD, 554714) prior to incubation with antibodies. Cells
were labeled for antibodies against CD90 (Abcam, ab3105;
Abcam, ab124527; Abcam, ab23894; BD, 555595), CD105
(Abcam, ab107595; Abcam, ab2529; Abcam, ab11414;
R&D Systems, Fab10971p), Pro-SPC (Bioss, bs 10067R;
Abcam, ab40879), CCSP (Abcam, ab171957), Epcam
(Abcam, ab71916, Abcam, ab168828; Life Technologies,
a15755), and Aqp5 (Abcam, ab78486; Abcam, ab85905)
and detected by Alexa Fluor 488 (Abcam, ab150117,
ab150077) or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FitC) (Abcam,
ab6840) secondary antibodies. Both unstained and iso-
type controls (Abcam, ab18419; BD, 559320; Abcam,
ab125938) were utilized as controls. Human adipose-
derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) were ob-
tained from Lonza. Flow Cytometry was performed on
the CytoFlex (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN) and

 analyzed using FCS Express (De Novo Software, Glendale,
CA) or CytExpert ((Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN).
Immunocytochemistry
Cells were plated onto fibronectin-coated 4-well chamber
slides (Millipore; PEZGS0416). Once the desired con-
fluency was achieved the slides were fixed in 4% parafor-
maldehyde (PFA) (Electron Microscopy Sciences; 15710)
followed by permeabilization and blocking with Dako Pro-
tein blocking solution (DAKO; X0909) containing 0.1%
saponin (Sigma-Aldrich; 47036) prior to immunocyto-
chemistry. Cells were stained for antibodies against CD90,
CD105, Pro-SPC, CCSP, Epcam, and Aqp5 and de-
tected by Alexa Fluor 488 or FitC secondary anti-
bodies. Slides were imaged on a fluorescent microscope
(Olympus; Olympus IX81, Center Valley PA).
Generation of heat-map images for immunostaining
Single channel immunostained images of the spheroids
were imported into ImageJ. The Rainbow RGB lookup
table was applied to each image to visualize cell marker
density distribution throughout the spheroids. A plot pro-
file histogram was then generated using the rainbow RGB
image.
Tube formation study
Human
umbilical
vein
endothelial
cells
(HUVECs;
American Type Culture Collection) were seeded onto
Matrigel in a 96-well plate at a density of 2 × 104 cells
per well with 100 μl of plain IMDM, LSC conditioned
media, or adipose derived-MSC conditioned media.
After 5 h, the wells were imaged with the Nikon TE-200
(Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). The average tube length was mea-
sured with NIH ImageJ software.
Biodistribution of LSCs after intravenous infusion
All studies were in compliance with the requirements
from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
at North Carolina State University. Athymic nude mice
(n = 10; Crl:NU(NCr)-Foxn1nu; Charles River Laboratories)
were intravenously injected with 5 × 106 LSCs from
passage 1–3 suspended in 300 μL of a 1:10 heparin/PBS
solution. Two different LSC lines were used and mice
were randomly assigned to the two different lines. Be-
fore injection, all cells were labeled with the lipophilic
tracer DiD (Invitrogen) as per their protocol for subse-
quent live imaging using the Xenogen Live Imager.
After taking baseline images, mice were injected with
the DiD-labeled LSCs. Subsequent images were taken
at 1, 4, 7, 11, and 20-day time points, after which the
mice were euthanized. The hearts, lungs, livers, spleens,
and kidneys were removed and imaged separately to allow
examination without interference from other tissues.
For each nude mouse, an image showing luminescence
was analyzed using the region of interest (ROI) tools
from the tools palette window of the Living Image 4.2
software package. First, the image was adjusted so that
each subject’s radiant efficiency reading was set to a
manually fixed scale (a minimum and maximum range).
This is important for visual comparisons of the different
time points but not necessary for using ROI tools. The
color table was set to Rainbow 2 and reversed for visual
clarity of the signal. A circular ROI was chosen and the
diameter was fixed to encompass the entire signal range.
The same diameter was used for every nude mouse image.
One ROI was placed around the lungs and another
around the liver of each subject. As the signal began to
fade from the organs, a heuristic technique was used to
separate the liver from the lungs. The liver signal
remained quite discernable so it was used as a starting
point. The upper extremity of the liver signal was used
as the outer-most edge of the lower-most region of the
lung signal. The two ROI perimeters were set so that
they never touched. The measurement type was set to
radiant efficiency and was then measured. The aver-
age radiant efficiency output was saved and exported
to Excel where it could be compared across the time
points.
Statistical analysis
All results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation
(SD) and Gaussian distribution of data is tested using
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and/or D’Agostino and Pear-
son omnibus normality test. Comparison between two
groups was conducted by two-tailed Student’s t-test.
One-way ANOVA was used for comparison among
three or more groups with Bonferroni post hoc correc-
tion. Differences were considered statistically significant
at P-values <0.05.
Results
Lung spheroid cells can be expanded from minimally
invasive transbronchial biopsies
Whole lung (WL) tissue samples and transbronchial
(TB) biopsy samples were obtained from the Cystic Fibro-
sis Center and Pulmonary Diseases Research and Treat-
ment Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill. Donor comorbidity information is presented in
Table 1. Samples were taken from the distal lung region of
either whole donor lungs or transbronchial biopsies. Tissue
samples were processed using the three-dimensional sus-
pension culture method (Fig. 1a). Both sample types
showed an outgrowth of phase-bright and stromal-like
cells approximately seven days post-plating (Fig. 1b-i).
Those outgrowth cells (or explant-derived cells, EDCs)
were then seeded onto ultra-low attachment flasks; under
these culture conditions the outgrowth cells spontaneously

 form a three-dimensional cell suspension termed a
“lung
spheroid”
(Fig.
1b-II).
When
plated
onto
fibronectin-coated surfaces, these lung spheroids gener-
ated 10–20 million cells that we termed “lung spheroid
cells” or LSCs (Fig. 1b-III-IV).
Compared to WL tissue samples, TB samples required
more time for the outgrowth of cells from the explant to
reach the desired confluency to process into spheres.
However, once the cells reached the sphere phase, the
LSCs produced from both sample types showed similar
growth rates, with 5–10 population doublings every
seven to fifteen days (Fig. 1c-d). This growth rate was
maintained for up to 7 passages, as long as 30 days with
appropriate freeze-thawing from cryopreservation and
long-term cell culture. From one TB lung biopsy, we
were able to derive >50 million LSCs at Passage 2. This
sustainable growth from TB samples indicates that
therapeutic lung cells may be derived and expanded
from a small sized tissue biopsy sample.
Lung spheroids contain heterogeneous cell populations
Immunocytochemistry displays positive CD90, CD105,
CCSP, ProSPC, AQP5, p63 and krt5 cell markers and
negative CD31, CD34 and CD45 markers in both whole
lung and transbronchial spheroids (Fig. 2a-b). This is
supported by western blot of the same markers (Fig. 2c).
Double staining revealed double positive populations of
ProSPC and AQP5, ProSPC and CCSP, and CD105 and
CD90 (Fig. 2d-e). Heat maps were generated from each
positive marker to examine the spherical distribution of
the markers showing the supporting cell types such as
CD90, CD105, and krt5 primarily at the sphere edge and
CCSP, ProSPC, AQP5 and p63 throughout the sphere
(Fig. 2f).
Lung spheroid cells exhibit a complex heterogeneous cell
phenotype
Flow cytometry revealed several positive populations of
lung progenitor cells (e.g. Club Cells [CCSP] and AT2
cells [Pro-SPC]) along with stromal-like supporting cells
(e.g. CD90, CD105) (Fig. 3a). WL-LSCs flow analysis
showed the cells were 73.1 ± 5.4% CCSP+, 92.3 ± 4.1%
AQP5+, 72.8 ± 5.3% Pro-SPC+, 78.8 ± 1.8% CD90+, 63.9 ±
6.1% CD105+, and 23.5 ± 6.9% Epcam+ (Fig. 3b). There
was no significant change in the supporting cell popula-
tions from EDCs to the final LSCs, but there was a clear
increase in the progenitor cell populations from the EDC
stage to LSCs, suggesting three-dimensional culture of
lung spheroids may have increased the “stemness” of the
cells. There was approximately a 37.2% increase in the
proportion of AT2 cells and 36.1% increase in the propor-
tion of club cells from the EDC to LSC stage. There
was also a slight but non-significant decrease in the pro-
portion of AT1 cells.
TB-LSCs are also positive for the same markers as
WL-LSCs, however, there is a difference in the percent-
age of positive cell populations (Fig. 3a; c). The levels of
CD90+ cells decreased by 23.8%, but CD105+ cells in-
creased by 22.3%. Lung secretory (CCSP) and alveolar
(Pro-SPC and AQP5) markers decreased 22.7%, 38.8%,
and 25.7% respectively. Overall, the phenotype of TB-
derived LSCs was slightly different from WL-derived
LSCs. Double stained flow cytometry reveled a double
positive population of lung secretory (CCSP) and alveo-
lar (Pro-SPC and AQP5) markers at approximately 39%
and 45% respectively (Fig. 3d). Further analysis of double
labeled cells for mesenchymal (CD105) and epithelial
(ProSPC) markers showed a double positive population
of approximately 38.29% (Additional file 1: Figure S1).
LSC phenotype was further supported by immuno-
cytochemistry which showed the cells are positive for
CCSP+, AQP5+, ProSPC+, CD90+, CD105+, and Epcam+
(data not shown). Taken together, these findings show
that the LSCs contain a wide mixture of cells including
club cells, AT1 cells, and AT2 cells, as well as CD90+
and CD105+ stromal-origin cells. It has also been previ-
ously reported that both cardiac and lung spheroids ex-
hibit progenitor cells in the
core of the spheres,
surrounded by supporting cells such as CD90+ and
CD105+ cells. This arrangement of cells resembles a
stem cell niche environment, necessary to regulate stem
cell behavior [30].
When LSCs were cultured with bronchia/trachea epi-
thelial cell growth medium (Sigma-Aldrich) there was a

 Biodistribution of intravenously-injected lung spheroid cells
Before clinical studies of LSCs are conducted in humans,
a major question to address related to where the cells
seed after systemic delivery. To determine where the
cells will target and how long they can be retained once
administered in-vivo, we fluorescently labeled LSCs with
DiD and administered 5 × 106 cells via the tail vain of
athymic nude mice. The mice were imaged at 24 h.,
7 days, 12 days, 18 days, and 21 days’ post injection
(Fig. 5a). After the final day 21, an image was acquired,
and the mice were then sacrificed and organs harvested.
At Day 1 post injection, most of the cell signal was found
in the lungs and liver, (Fig. 5b-c), and this persisted up
to the endpoint at day 21. With such a large dose of in-
fusion (5 million cells in a mouse can be extrapolated to
nearly 5 billion cells for a human), no tumor formation

markers in the lung tissue (Fig. 5f). However, these same

 markers are absent in liver tissues (Fig. 5g). It is worth
noting that despite the use of two different cell lines were
used for the intravenous injection, of cells no differences
were found in the overall cell fate or the rate at which the
signal strength subsided with time. Altogether, these data-
sets indicated that intravenous delivery is an effective
method to deliver LSCs to the lungs.
Discussion
Lung disease remains one of the top causes of morbidity
and mortality worldwide [31]. Chronic and degenerative
diseases of the airway and alveolar tissues, such as
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idio-
pathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), are particularly devastat-
ing and to date have no cure [32, 33]. Despite advances
in supportive care and symptomatic treatments, allogeneic
lung transplantation is the only effective treatment for
these disorders, but the procedure is highly complicated
and highly invasive. Complicating this fact is the lifelong
immunosuppression required to prevent rejection. Fur-
ther, lung transplantation has a high five-year mortality
rate at approximately 50% [34]. Therefore, new treat-
ment paradigms are desperately needed.
Stem cell-based therapy appears to be a potential
major advancement in treating these lung diseases.
Major progress has been made in the field of lung regen-
erative medicine in the past few decades as various stem
and progenitor cell populations have been identified and
characterized, such as bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASC)
[35], alveolar bipotential progenitor (BP) cells [3], and
other putative distal lung stem and progenitor cell popula-
tions. This provides cells for potential new approaches for
treating different lung diseases. Although these stem and
progenitor cell populations have been defined, it remains
difficult to isolate pure populations of these cells due to a
lack of specificity in discreaning surface markers, since
many markers are shared between these cell populations.
Therefore, mesenchymal stromal cells remain the pre-
ferred choice for cell-based therapy in several lung dis-
eases due to their ease of isolation and production, despite
the identification of resident lung stem and progenitor
cells.
It is important to keep in mind that stem cells do not
act alone, but rather interact with surrounding cells (i.e.
niche) to perform their necessary functions in both
homeostasis and in response to injury. Multicellular
spheroids have been used for neural and cardiac stem
cells [30, 36, 37] with great success. We have recently
shown that lung spheroid cells have regenerative abilities
in treating early stage pulmonary fibrosis in a murine
model [26]. In the present study, we present two distinct
sources for LSC generations using a simple and robust
method. Whether generated from whole lung donors or
a small transbronchial biopsy, we are able to derive
therapeutic cells from both tissue sources. However, it
should be noted that whole lung tissue sources were
from deceased donors with no history of lung disease
(i.e. healthy lungs) while transbronchial tissue sources
were from donors suffering advance lung disease (Table 1).
This fundamental difference in the tissue source could ac-
count for the significant phenotypic difference in the pro-
portion of mesenchymal (CD90 and CD105) and alveolar
(AQP5 and ProSPC) markers (Fig. 3 a & c); however, re-
gardless of tissue source, both WL and TB-LSCs express
the same overall phenotypes and growth potential (Figs. 1–
3). The cell yield and growth potential were comparable
for both types of LSCs and are suitable for clinical applica-
tions (Fig. 1). The ease of our method is due in large part
to the lack of segregation of different cell types, precluding
the need for cell sorting. In addition, our method of lung
spheroid generation is without bias for any particular cell
type (Figs. 2; 3a-c). Therefore, LSCs express a heteroge-
neous phenotype of both mesenchymal and epithelial
markers. We believe the stem and progenitor cells are im-
portant for regeneration, and their effect is maximized
when non-stem epithelial and mesenchymal cells provide
the necessary niche environment for proper stem cell
function (Fig. 2). This is especially true for the stromal-
like supporting cells, as it’s been shown that fibroblasts
and growth factors, such as FGF 9 and 10 can regulate
stem cell homeostasis and activation through Wnt sig-
naling [38–41].
The lung is characterized as having “facultative” pro-
genitor cell populations where differentiated cells such
as club cells may be induced to re-enter the cell cycle
and proliferate in response to stimuli [42]. This type of
response is similar to the liver which has the ability to
regenerate in response to injury, but is otherwise quies-
cent. This is different from organs with high cellular
turnover that require a dedicated stem cell population,
such as the intestine or skin and hair; or organs like the
brain which have limited ability to regenerate even after
injury. As shown via flow cytometry, the markers for
lung secretory (CCSP) and alveolar (Pro-SPC) cells, widely
accepted as “facultative” lung progenitor cells, showed a
significant increase from explants (EDC) to LSCs (Fig. 3b).
This suggests that progenitor cell populations are enriched
through the 3-dimensional spheroid culture, perhaps by
recapitulating the natural niche environment of the cells.
The high percentage of both club and AT2 cells suggest
that there is a subpopulation that expresses both markers,
which is a hallmark of BASC. There also appears to be an
overlap in AT1 and AT2 cell expression, which could be
due to the presence of BP cells or intermediate cells in
AT2 to AT1 differentiation. It’s also been suggested that
AT1 cells have phenotypic plasticity and may not be ter-
minal cells as commonly believed [14]. AT1 cells cultured
on fibronectin surfaces in 20% FBS without additional

 growth factors, similar to the culture condition used in
this study, have been shown to proliferate and express
phenotypic markers of other cell types such as AT2 cells
(Fig. 3). AT1 cells cultured in keratinocyte growth factor
have also been shown to lose expression of AT1 markers
while reacquiring AT2 markers.
As an important in vitro potency indicator of cell ther-
apy, we performed an endothelial tube formation assay
to demonstrate the therapeutic potential of WL-LSCs
and TB-LSCs in comparison to MSCs (Fig. 4). We
showed that LSCs outperformed AD-MSCs in their an-
giogenic ability, as shown through endothelial cell tube
formation. In vivo, we were able to show, using fluores-
cently labeled LSCs, that the majority of the cells could
be seen in the lungs, where they persisted for up to
21 days (Fig. 5a-g). Even though the liver has high fluor-
escence, immunostaining shows the absence of cells
engrafted in the liver as compared to cell clusters found
in the lung (Fig. 5e). This suggests that the high fluores-
cence in the liver may be due to the natural auto-fluor-
escent nature of the liver, shown in Additional file 2:
Figure S2, and/or a combination of a leak in the fluor-
escence tracer and cell debris from dead cells that
were labeled with the fluorescence tracer that mi-
grated and were subsequently taken up by the liver.
Further immunostaining for lung specific markers
shows that if any LSCs were to engraft in the liver,
they do not retain lung phenotype (Fig. 5f-g). There
was also a large amount of off-target cell migration to
the liver, but otherwise no complications or tumor
formation
were
observed in
any animal
subjects
throughout the study.
Conclusions
The results show that lung cells have great plasticity, due
in large part to cell culture conditions and crosstalk be-
tween cells and between cells and their environment.
Thus, lung stem and progenitor cell “organoids/spheres,”
with their various niche cells, can be considered superior
to pure stem cell populations because they provide the
proper cellular support and allow cell signaling. There re-
mains much to be elucidated about the dynamic feedback
between stem cells and their niche and how feasible and
effective these cells are at treating severely damaged lung
epithelium. Lung spheroids and lung spheroid cells pro-
vide a new avenue to explore those questions.
Thus, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to
derive lung spheroid cells containing potential therapeutic
lung cells from minimally invasive transbronchial biopsy
specimens. Through our simple and highly reproducible
three-dimensional culture method, therapeutic lung cells
can be generated from small biopsy sized tissues in high
efficiency and in clinically relevant numbers. Future
studies will focus on the therapeutic potential of trans-
bronchial biopsy-derived lung spheroid cells in animal
models of lung diseases.
