Axons in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) fail to regenerate after 
injury. A major goal of neuroscience is to develop strategies to promote axon 
regeneration and to re-establish accurate circuit connections. Using the mouse visual 
system as a model I show that neural activity of adult retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) 
induced by either visual experience or by chemogenetic activation, promotes axon 
regeneration after optic nerve crush. When combined with activation of the cell growth-
promoting protein, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), visual stimulation-driven 
RGC activity triggers axons to regenerate all the way back into the brain. Analysis of 
  
 
xv 
genetically-labeled RGC types revealed that remarkably, regrowth is target specific: RGC 
axons navigated back to their correct visual targets and avoided incorrect visual targets 
suggesting the guidance cues that direct RGC axons are either still present or are re-
expressed in response to regeneration. Moreover, the target-specific regrowth of adult 
RGC axons resulted in partial recovery of several different visual functions. These 
findings indicate that visually-evoked and artificially-induced sensory activity can be 
powerful tools for enhancing axon regeneration and they highlight the remarkable 
capacity of mammalian CNS neurons to re-establish accurate circuit connections in the 
adult brain.  
  
 
1 
INTRODUCTION 
Neurons in the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS) fail to regenerate 
their axons after injury. This is in contrast to neurons in the peripheral nervous system 
(PNS), which regenerate their axons at rates up to 4.4mm/day (Gutmann et al., 1941). 
The failure of CNS neurons to regenerate establishes a major roadblock to recovery of 
sensory, cognitive and motor defects that occur in response to traumatic injuries and 
neurodegenerative diseases (reviewed in: Goldberg and Barres, 2000; De Vos et al., 
2008; Liu et al., 2011; He and Jin, 2016). In the last four decades, the regeneration field 
has advanced considerably in its efforts to understand the discrepancy between axon 
regrowth capacity in the PNS versus the CNS, and has used this distinction to develop 
strategies to promote injured CNS neurons to regenerate the axons. 
While regenerative failure is generally an issue faced by mammalian CNS 
neurons, researchers have used invertebrate models such as nematodes and fruit flies to 
overcome some of the technical limitations inherent in the mammalian CNS. Cold-
blooded vertebrates such as fish and amphibians - in which CNS neurons readily 
regenerate - have also been used to investigate cellular and molecular mechanisms of 
axon regeneration. Before introducing background on mammalian CNS regeneration, I 
will highlight a subset of the invertebrate and cold-blooded vertebrate studies which stand 
as particularly important contributions to the field. In terms of mammalian CNS 
regeneration, two major sets of factors have been shown to prevent regeneration of 
injured axons: extrinsic and intrinsic factors. I will highlight the different strategies 
neurobiologists have implemented to either down-regulate extrinsic inhibitory factors 
and/or up-regulate intrinsic growth factors to promote axon regeneration.

Invertebrates and cold-blooded vertebrates as models for regeneration 
The use of invertebrate genetic model organisms such as nematodes and fruit flies 
has provided significant contributions to parsing out the molecular mechanisms of axon 
regeneration. For the invertebrate organisms that are either transparent or semi-
transparent, laser ablations to selectively sever axons while causing minimal damage to 
surrounding tissues present unique single-axon resolution to examine detailed axonal 
responses (Ghosh-Roy et al., 2010; Soares et al., 2014). In general, invertebrate animals 
have the capacity to regenerate their nerves after injury, and researchers have used 
forward and reverse genetics to identify a set of genes that are either favorable or 
disruptive to axon regeneration. Recently, multiple groups have used C. elegans and D. 
melanogaster to discover that dual-leucine zipper kinase MAPKKK 1 (DLK-1), a 
molecule known to be involved in facilitating synaptogenesis and axon outgrowth during 
development and in regulating neurodegeneration after injury, is also critical in 
promoting axon regeneration after nerve injury in these organisms (Hammarlund et al., 
2009; Yan et al., 2009; Ghosh-Roy et al., 2010; Xiong et al., 2010). Bastiani and 
colleagues identified DLK-1 as required for promoting axon regeneration of γ-
aminobutyric acid (GABA)–releasing motor neurons in C. elegans (Hammarlund et al., 
2009). Furthermore, Jin and coworkers identified the downstream effectors of DLK-1 -  
MAP kinase Activated protein Kinase 2 (MAK-2) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding 
proteins 1 (CEBP-1) - as critical for promoting axon regeneration of PLM and ALM 
neurons in C. elegans (Yan et al., 2009). In D. melanogaster, Wallenda, a conserved 
MAPKKK homologous to DLK-1 in C. elegans, was essential for activating an injury 
signaling cascade including the downstream effectors - c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase 
  
 
3 
MAPK (JNK) and the transcription factor Fos - and was required for promoting axon 
regeneration of motor neurons and sensory neurons of the D. melanogaster in the larval 
stage (Xiong et al., 2010).  
Testing the novel function of key molecular pathways in higher mammals is 
essential for potentially identifying therapeutic targets to treat traumatic brain injuries and 
neurodegenerative diseases in humans. Building on results in worms and flies, 
investigators studied the role of DLK-1 in mammalian models. Using DLK gene-trap 
mice and DLK knockout (KO) mice, they showed that dorsal root ganglion neurons 
(DRGs) without functional DLK protein are impaired in axon regeneration after crush 
(Itoh et al., 2009; Shin et al., 2012). The critical role of DLK in regulating axon 
regeneration in mammals illustrates the conserved function of molecular signaling 
pathways from invertebrate organisms to mammalian organisms. Because neurons in 
invertebrate organisms readily regenerate their axons, testing powerful manipulations in 
those animals, which are not feasible in the higher mammalian organisms, can further 
elucidate the mechanism of axon regeneration.  
The other model organisms that have been widely used to aid our understanding 
of axon regeneration are cold-blooded vertebrates, such as fish and amphibians. Cold-
blooded vertebrates can naturally regenerate some (but not all) of their CNS axons after 
nerve injury (reviewed in: Gaze, 1970). One way these species promote axon 
regeneration is by continuously adding new neurons after development - a phenomenon 
called neurogenesis. Meyer (1978) showed that in adult goldfish new retinal cells that 
were labeled with tritiated thymidine migrated to the entire retinal circumference (Meyer, 
1978). Another way they promote axon regeneration is by providing an environment that 
  
 
4 
is favorable for axon regeneration. Studies in the 1980s and 90s characterized the CNS 
environment of both cold-blooded vertebrates (that can regenerate their CNS axons) and 
warm-blooded vertebrates (that fail to regenerate their CNS axons). Different groups 
observed that rat DRGs could regenerate their axons through optic nerve sheath explants 
from goldfish but not through optic nerve explants from rats (Carbonetto et al., 1987; 
Caroni and Schwab, 1988). A series of biochemical studies revealed that the fish CNS 
environment harbors oligodendrocytes which are molecularly distinct from mammalian 
CNS oligodendrocytes by virtue of their myelin protein expression and by their ability to 
promote, rather than inhibit, axon regeneration (Caroni and Schwab, 1988; Jeserich and 
Rauen, 1990; Bastmeyer et al., 1991). These important findings suggest that the CNS 
environment of cold-blooded vertebrates lacks axon growth inhibiting molecules present 
in the mammalian CNS environment. Furthermore, axotomy of CNS neurons in cold-
blooded vertebrates triggers up-regulation of growth-associated proteins including GAP-
43 and cell adhesion molecules including E587-Ag and neurolin in fish and amphibian 
CNS neurons (Mizobuchi et al., 1990; Bisby and Tetzlaff, 1992; Stuermer et al., 1992; 
Petrausch et al., 2000).  
Axon regeneration in the fish and frog visual system is a widely studied 
regeneration model. After optic nerve transection in fish, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) - 
a type of CNS neuron - spontaneously regenerate their axons to re-innervate and 
occasionally even synapse in the optic tectum - their distal-most visual target (Sperry, 
1963; Jacobson and Gaze, 1965). Moreover, they re-innervate the tectum with retinotopic 
precision (Gaze, 1970). Cline and colleagues observed that removing the optic tectum in 
one side of the brain induced RGC axons to regenerate to the opposite tectum in a 
  
 
5 
retinotopically precise manner in developing tadpoles (Ruthazer et al., 2003). Others have 
discovered that the regenerating RGC axons are more likely to misroute to the wrong side 
of the brain compared to the projection patterns of normal, uninjured RGCs (Stelzner et 
al., 1981; Bohn and Stelzner, 1981). Notably, some studies directly attributed cold-
blooded vertebrates’ capacity to regenerate their CNS axons to their neurogenesis of 
some CNS neurons over their lifetime (reviewed in Holder and Clarke, 1988). RGCs of 
frog species R. pipiens that undergo neurogenesis over lifetime of the organism can re-
innervate their axons to optic tectum after optic nerve transection (Gaze, 1970). On the 
contrary, tectal efferents in R. pipiens, which stop proliferating after metamorphosis, fail 
to regenerate their axons after brainstem hemisection (Lyon and Stelzner, 1987). This 
observation suggests that CNS neurons’ ability or inability to undergo neurogenesis may 
be the central distinction between their capacity and failure, respectively, to regenerate 
consistently after injury.  
In addition to goldfish and frogs, researchers have used the salamander ‘axolotl’ 
to identify the types of neural progenitors and their migration patterns that take place 
during spinal cord regeneration after injury. Tanaka and colleagues grafted green 
fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled spinal cord to a host with a transected spinal cord and 
found that a small region next to the amputation plane generates PAX7- and PAX6-
expressing neural progenitors. Those progenitors in turn produced daughter cells to 
expand along the anterior/posterior axis but also stay close to the dorsal/ventral location 
of the parent for regeneration, indicating that the factors establishing the domains of the 
regenerating spinal cord comes from the mature spinal cord (McHedlishvili et al., 2007). 
More recently, using an expression cloning strategy followed by in vivo gain- and loss-of-
  
 
6 
function assays, Tanaka’s group has identified axolotl MARCKS-like protein (MLP) that 
activates the initial cell cycle response during appendage regeneration (Sugiura et al., 
2016). Together, cold-blooded vertebrates’ capacity to spontaneously regenerate CNS 
axons provide important molecular distinctions from mammalian organisms that can be 
used to further elucidate the molecular pathways that regulate mammalian CNS axon 
regeneration. 
 
Extrinsic limits on regeneration of mammalian CNS axons 
Many decades of work indicate that factors inherent to the mature CNS 
environment provide an unfavorable milieu for axon regeneration (reviewed in: Yiu and 
He, 2006). By contrast, neurons in the PNS readily regenerate. During 1970s and 80s, 
Aguayo and colleagues investigated whether the CNS environment constitutes an 
unfavorable barrier for axon regeneration. They transected either optic nerve or spinal 
cord and bridged the severed ends with sciatic nerve grafts - a PNS nerve - and then 
assessed regeneration of CNS axons through the graft. Remarkably, CNS neurons that do 
not normally regenerate in their native CNS environment regenerated long distances 
through the sciatic nerve graft (Richardson et al., 1980; David and Aguayo, 1981; Vidal-
Sanz et al., 1987). When the group repeated the experiments using CNS nerve grafts, 
there was no axon regeneration (personal communication with A. Aguayo). This 
indicated that factors inherent to the mature CNS environment provide an unfavorable 
milieu for axon regeneration. 
 
 
  
 
7 
Myelin-associated inhibitors 
After this significant discovery, many neurobiologists focused on identifying the 
extrinsic factors that inhibit mammalian CNS axon regeneration. Schwab and colleagues 
identified myelin as a potent inhibitor of CNS regeneration and biochemically purified 
the myelin-associated protein Nogo as one source of this inhibition. When they added 
antibodies against Nogo, the central branch of axons from dissociated DRGs could 
regenerate through the rat spinal cord and the optic nerve explants (Schnell and Schwab, 
1990; Chen et al., 2000). Other groups discovered additional myelin-associated inhibitors 
such as myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) (Mukhopadhyay et al., 1994; 
McKerracher et al., 1994) and oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein (OMgp) (Wang et 
al., 2002) that also inhibit axon regeneration of dissociated developing and adult CNS 
neurons in MAG- and OMgp-expressing substrates, respectively. It was later discovered 
that Nogo receptor (NgR) binds with high affinity to MAG and OMgp, suggesting that 
neutralizing all three myelin-associated inhibitors are functionally redundant in 
disinhibiting axon regeneration (Wang et al., 2002; Domeniconi et al., 2002; Liu et al., 
2002).  
In vivo studies of Nogo knockout mice suggest that deleting genes for myelin 
inhibitors alone may not be sufficient to promote substantial amount of CNS axon 
regeneration (Cafferty and Strittmatter, 2006; Lee et al., 2010a; Lee et al., 2010b; 
Cafferty et al., 2010). Zheng and colleagues have assessed the regenerative capacity of 
injured corticospinal and raphespinal serotonergic axons by knocking out all three major 
myelin inhibitors, Nogo, MAG, and OMgp, in mice and discovered that these triple-
mutant mice failed to show enhanced regeneration (Lee et al., 2010). Their results 
  
 
8 
indicate that while myelin-based factors play an inhibitory role in CNS neurite 
outgrowth, removing them alone is insufficient to promote axon regeneration in vivo. 
 
Scarring as a barrier  
In addition to myelin, reactive glial scarring is another factor that acts as a barrier 
of CNS axon regeneration. CNS injury triggers mass recruitment of microglia, 
oligodendrocyte precursors, meningeal cells, and reactive astrocytes to the lesion site 
(Davies et al., 1997). Silver and others reported that reactive astrocytes upregulate 
extracellular molecules called chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) at the core of 
the lesion and that such extracellular molecules inhibit neurite extension (Gallo et al., 
1987; Snow et al., 1990; McKeon et al., 1991). The Fawcett and McMahon labs 
investigated whether neutralizing CSPGs in the reactive glial scar could promote 
regeneration of CNS axons. They administered chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) to the 
lesioned dorsal columns of adult rats, in order to remove CSPG glycosaminoglycan 
(GAG) in the area of reactive glial scarring. This promoted some regeneration of 
descending cortico-spinal axons and ascending sensory projections and restored some 
locomotor and proprioceptive behaviors (Bradbury et al., 2002). Recently, Giger and 
colleagues observed that CSPGs bind to NgR 1 and 3 and discovered shared molecular 
mechanisms of myelin-associated and CSPG-specific inhibition of axon regeneration 
(Dickendesher et al., 2012). Furthermore, Sofroniew and colleagues revealed that 
astrocytic glial scars are in fact aiding, rather than inhibiting, axon regeneration after 
spinal cord lesions. Genetically removing or attenuating the astrocytic scars reduced the 
extent of regeneration of transected corticospinal, sensory, and serotonergic axons 
  
 
9 
(Anderson et al., 2016). The extent of the inhibitory role of glial scar in in vivo axon 
regeneration models remains to be further investigated. 
 
Repellent guidance cues 
Other major extrinsic factors are repellant guidance cues that remain expressed in 
the adult CNS after development and regulate axon regeneration after injury. 
Semaphorins are classic short-range inhibitory guidance cues that repel growing axons 
from innervating incorrect targets during development (Behar et al., 1996). In the adult 
CNS, one of their roles is to stabilize the established circuitry by limiting axonal growth 
as adult DRGs undergo growth cone collapse in the presence of Sema3A in vitro (Reza et 
al., 1999). The inhibitory role of Sema3A was evident when preconditioned adult DRG 
axons failed to grow through the PNS injury lesion sites that express Sema3A 
(Pasterkamp et al., 2001). On the contrary, the Sema3 expression was down-regulated in 
the PNS nerves while the spinal and facial motor neurons spontaneously regenerated their 
axons through the lesion site, suggesting one potential mechanism of why axons fail to 
regenerate in the CNS (Pasterkamp et al., 1998). In addition to the semaphorins, ephrins 
predominantly repel migrating axons away from the site of Eph/ephrin activation 
(Marquardt et al., 2005). In response to CNS injury, ephrin expression is upregulated in 
myelin and reactive astrocytes (Wilson et al., 2002; Bundesen et al., 2003; Benson et al., 
2005). EphA4-deficient mice enhanced axon regeneration of corticospinal and 
rubrospinal tracts and reduced the size of gliosis and expression of CSPGs at the lesion 
site after spinal cord hemisection (Goldshmit et al., 2004). This suggests potential shared 
mechanism between glial scar and repellent cues in preventing CNS axon regeneration.

Studies that targeted extrinsic factors to trigger CNS axon regeneration revealed that 
removing the extrinsic factors promote regeneration of some CNS axons in certain 
contexts but is not sufficient to trigger robust, long-distance regeneration of CNS axons, 
due to repressed intrinsic growth capacity of mature CNS axons. 
 
Intrinsic limits on regeneration of mammalian CNS axons 
Another barrier to CNS regeneration is the dramatic reduction of neuronal growth 
capacity as they age. As neurons transition from embryonic to postnatal stages, they 
downregulate their expression of cell growth-related pathways and proteins (reviewed in: 
He and Jin, 2016). A number of groups have shown that isolated early embryonic CNS 
neurons can extend their neurites through both neonatal and adult CNS substrates but that 
their growth capacity declined sharply after neonatal development (Shewan et al., 1995; 
Chen et al., 1995; Goldberg et al., 2002a). Numerous potential factors include steady 
decline of classic secondary messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels 
during neuronal development (Cai et al., 2001). Gene profiling analyses further revealed 
that the expression of Kruppel-like factors (KLFs) in RGCs changes around the neonatal 
period (Moore et al., 2009). Functional studies further confirmed that KLF6 and KLF7 
could promote axon regeneration while KLF4 could inhibit axon regeneration (Moore et 
al., 2009; Blackmore et al., 2012). Other groups revealed that in many types of CNS 
neurons, the expression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) - a master regulator 
of protein synthesis - becomes downregulated gradually over the course of neuronal 
development (Park et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2010; Belin et al., 2015; Geoffroy et al., 2016). 
He and colleagues discovered that activating the mTOR signaling cascade in mature CNS 
  
 
11 
neurons by removing the negative regulator of mTOR - phosphatase tensin homolog 
(PTEN) - triggered robust axon regeneration of RGCs and cortico-spinal tract after optic 
nerve crush and spinal cord pyramidotomy, respectively (Park et al., 2008; Liu et al., 
2010; Zukor et al., 2013). Identifying the intrinsic factors that are downregulated in the 
mature CNS neurons has led to key discoveries of molecular pathways that could be 
manipulated to promote robust CNS axon regeneration. 
A variety of cellular and molecular responses at the lesion site after injury can be 
potentially targeted to promote axon regeneration. Some of the direct molecular 
responses to CNS insult include local activation and retrograde transport of several MAP 
kinases - the Erk (Hanz et al., 2003; Perlson et al., 2005), JNK (Cavalli et al., 2005; 
Lindwall et al., 2005), and the protein kinase G (Sung et al., 2006). Matsumoto and 
coworkers identified a novel growth factor - suppressor of vhp-1 (SVH-1) - and its 
receptor tyrosine kinase SVH-2 that regulate axon regeneration of motor neurons via 
JNK-MAPK pathway in C. elegans (Li et al., 2012). Moreover, glial cells at the lesion 
site release cytokines to activate Janus kinase/the signal transducer and activator of 
transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway in response to injury (Schobitz et al., 1992). 
The activation of JAK/STAT pathway subsequently triggers secondary messengers to 
activate axon growth, as numerous studies demonstrated that overexpression of ciliary 
neurotrophic factor (CNTF) - a cytokine that directly activates the JAK/STAT pathway - 
triggered CNS axon regeneration after injury (Leaver et al., 2006; Pernet et al., 2013; Jin 
et al., 2015).  
Numerous groups have observed that the downstream effector of JAK/STAT 
signaling pathway, STAT3, is exclusively activated in response to PNS nerve injury but 
  
 
12 
not CNS nerve injury, suggesting its important role in axon regeneration (Schweiger et 
al., 2000; Qiu et al., 2005). Kerschensteiner’s group elegantly demonstrated that 
conditional deletion of STAT3 in DRGs abolished its axon regeneration of peripheral 
branch while overexpressing STAT3 in DRGs enhanced its axon regeneration of central 
branch (Bareyre et al., 2010). Consistently, deleting the negative regulator of the 
JAK/STAT pathway, suppressor of cytokine 3 (SOCS3), promoted RGC axon 
regeneration after optic nerve crush (Smith et al., 2009). Studies that manipulate injury 
signaling factors in order to disinhibit axon growth after injury continue to elucidate the 
molecular mechanism of the injury response in the PNS and CNS systems and provide 
valuable insight to the mechanism of CNS axon regeneration. 
One important factor that is now starting to be more heavily explored in the 
context of axon regeneration is neural activity. During development, neural activity 
promotes cell survival, dendritic and axon growth, and axon refinement (Mao et al., 
1999; McAllister et al., 1996; Meyer-Franke et al., 1995; Sretavan et al., 1988; Goldberg 
et al., 2002b). After development is completed, activity-dependent plasticity continues 
throughout the brain. For instance, exercise-conditioned animals showed enhanced 
regrowth of DRG axons compared to sedentary animals after nerve crush injury (Molteni 
et al., 2004). To enhance or suppress neural activity, neurobiologists have used electrical 
stimulation or tetrodotoxin (TTX), respectively, and more recently, designer receptors 
exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD) (Urban and Roth, 2015). Goldberg et 
al. (2002b) demonstrated that electrically stimulating purified RGCs coupled with brain-
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) treatment enhanced axon growth in vitro. Others 
discovered that in the PNS, periodic electrical stimulation increased the speed and 
  
 
13 
accuracy of motor neuron axon regeneration back to their correct targets after nerve 
transection, whereas TTX treatment abolished this electrical stimulation-induced axon 
regeneration (Al-Majed et al., 2000). In mouse models, trans-corneal stimulation of the 
eye enhanced RGC axon regeneration after optic nerve crush (Tagami et al., 2009). 
Furthermore, elevating melapnopsin expression in RGCs enhanced axon regeneration 
after optic nerve crush (Li et al., 2015). These studies highlight the potential therapeutic 
benefits of neuronal activity to treat mammalian CNS degeneration.  
 
Probing specificity of axon regeneration 
In addition to triggering long distance regeneration of CNS axons, ensuring that 
the regenerated axons find and reconnect to the correct nuclei in the brain is critical for 
functional recovery. The innervation of CNS axons to correct targets during development 
relies on a host of guidance expressions including ephrins, slits, Wnts, and cadherins 
(e.g., Dickson, 2002; Schmitt et al., 2006; Harada et al., 2007; Osterhout et al., 2011). 
Axon guidance/repellent cues that are expressed during development undergo changes in 
their expression as the animal ages (reviewed in: Harel and Strittmatter, 2006). In 
addition, injury itself may alter the expression of these cues, which in turn could present a 
major challenge for regenerating axons to steer toward correct targets (reviewed in: Guan 
and Rao, 2003; Koeberle and Bahr, 2003; Harel and Strittmatter, 2006; Giger et al., 
2011). 
.Regeneration literature presents evidence that axons that regenerate long 
distances possess the capacity to re-innervate correct targets. Studies in invertebrates or 
cold-blooded vertebrates demonstrate that some neurons are capable of regenerating back 
  
 
14 
to the correct target region. For example, in gold fish, retinal axons can regenerate back 
to and re-innervate the correct layer of the optic tectum after optic nerve crush (Murray 
and Edwards, 1982). In the larval sea lamprey, the majority of the spinal axons regenerate 
beyond the transection site in a proper direction with a similar projection pattern of 
uninjured spinal axons (Mackler et al., 1986). In salamander, DRGs fully regenerate their 
axons back to proper targets for recovery of limb movement (McHedlishvili et al., 2012).  
In the mammalian visual system, Aguayo and coworkers observed that long-
distance regenerating RGC axons through the PNS graft preferentially regenerate to the 
stratum opticum (SO) and stratum griseum superficiale (SGS), the main layers in superior 
colliculus (SC) that normally receive RGC axonal innervation (Vidal-Sanz et al., 1987). 
This target-specific re-innervation suggests that regenerating RGCs can recognize which 
SC layers are visual and correctly re-innervate. Moreover, Bahr and colleagues reported 
that the RGC axons from the retinal explants preferentially regenerated towards the 
deafferented SC (e.g. optic nerve lesioned) (Wizenmann et al., 1993) and they grew 
towards the correct region of the SC (Wizenmann and Bahr, 1998). More recently, 
Benowitz’s group showed that triple manipulations that included enhancement of mTOR 
signaling and cAMP as well as chronic injections of zymosan to increase oncomodulin 
could trigger long-distance regeneration of RGC axons and furthermore, guide 
regenerating RGC axons to visual targets in the brain for partial recovery of function (de 
Lima et al., 2012).  
In the spinal cord, numerous studies showed.target specificity of regenerating 
DRG axons in both central and peripheral branches. For example, investigating the 
regeneration of DRG axons showed that systemic induction of the GDNF family 
  
 
15 
member, artemin, could trigger re-innervation of regenerating DRGs to a correct layer of 
the dorsal horn (Harvey et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2012). Furthermore, Brushart and 
coworkers showed that electrical stimulation allowed normally regenerating peripheral 
axons of DRGs to correct targets in the periphery (Brushart et al., 2005). In all the 
studies, either the regenerating neurons are intrinsically capable and/or their environment 
presents correct guidance cues for target re- innervation. 
 
The eye-to-brain ‘retinofugal’ pathway as a model for CNS axon regeneration 
The optic pathway consisting of RGC projections down the optic nerve and into 
the brain is a classic and still highly utilized model for studying CNS regeneration (Vidal-
Sanz et al., 1987; Park et al., 2008; Benowitz and Yin, 2010; de Lima et al., 2012). 
Normally, following the unilateral optic nerve crush, RGC axons fail to regenerate 
through the lesion sites and eventually die (Chierzi et al., 1999). Recent work showed 
that increasing the mTOR signaling pathway can promote a substantial number of RGCs 
to survive and regenerate their axons down the optic nerve after lesions (Park et al., 
2008), an effect that is further increased by the co-deletion of the SOCS3 (Smith et al., 
2009; Sun et al., 2011).  
A critical step for the re-establishment of functional visual circuits after optic 
nerve injury is the regeneration of RGC axons past the optic chiasm and into the brain. 
The retinofugal pathway includes several dozen target nuclei distributed from the 
hypothalamic forebrain to the caudal midbrain (reviewed in: Morin and Studholm, 2014). 
The precise connectivity between RGCs and their targets is essential for proper visual 
perception. For RGC axons to regenerate long distances in a target-specific manner, they 
  
 
16 
must 1) be triggered to regenerate (i.e. by enhancing cell growth signaling pathways and 
attenuating regulatory pathways), 2) overcome inhibitory factors (i.e. by removing 
myelin-associated inhibitors and glial scars), and 3) be able to pathfind to and re-
innervate correct visual targets and select a correct layer in a topographically precise 
manner (i.e. by re-expressing appropriate guidance cues and enhancing neural activity). 
Strategies that provide sustained, long-distance RGC axon regeneration back into the 
brain, however, have remained scarce. RGC axons that regenerate long distances remain 
stalled at the optic chiasm and thus, remain divorced from their targets in the brain (Park 
et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2011). Benowitz and coworkers revealed that RGCs could be 
stimulated to regenerate long distances and re-innervate into the various visual targets in 
the brain for partial recovery of visual functions (de Lima et al., 2012). However, they 
observed reduced number of axon regeneration over time, suggesting that the regenerated 
RGCs eventually die, and thereby prevent enduring functional recovery.  
Mammals have ~30 types of RGCs (reviewed in: Dhande et al., 2015); each type 
responds best to a particular feature in the visual world (i.e. direction of motion, color or 
edges) and sends its axons to specific retinorecipient target(s) in the brain. The Huberman 
lab and others previously discovered and characterized various transgenic mouse lines 
that harbor GFP in specific RGC types (reviewed in: Dhande et al., 2015) and others have 
shown that regeneration is biased mainly toward α-like RGC types (Duan et al., 2015). 
These transgenic mouse lines can be useful to probe cell-type specific regeneration of 
visual circuitry, especially at the level of target re-innervation. The questions posed and 
addressed here in the context of the mammalian CNS regeneration are as follows: 
 
  
 
17 
1. What are the factors that can promote long-distance CNS axon regeneration? 
2. What are the patterns of regenerated CNS projections and connections? 
3. What are the behavioral capacity of regenerated visual circuits?  
 
Rationale 
I investigated the above questions using the mouse eye-to-brain retinofugal 
pathway. The main objective of my thesis was to develop strategies for promoting RGC 
axon regeneration long distances and replenishing functionally precise connections in the 
brain after optic nerve injury. The first necessary step toward repairing the damaged 
neural circuitry in the visual system was promoting long-distance axon regeneration of 
RGCs. The next step was to probe whether RGC axons that regenerate long distances 
have the capacity to re-innervate to correct targets using the transgenic mouse lines that 
genetically label specific RGC type. One way to assess the function of the RGC axons 
that regenerated to their correct targets was to run visual behavior tests that would require 
proper connection of the RGCs to their target nuclei. Ultimately, my goal is to uncover 
the biology of neurological defects through understanding the cellular and molecular 
mechanisms of how traumatic brain injuries and neurodegenerative diseases progress 
over time. All of this groundwork could lead to the development of better treatments for 
patients suffering from these diseases.

Neurons in the adult mammalian CNS fail to regenerate after injury, 
thereby preventing recovery of numerous CNS functions1. A major 
goal of neuroscience is to identify the factors that limit CNS regen-
eration and devise therapeutic strategies to overcome them. Previous 
work has illustrated that factors inherent to the mature CNS envi-
ronment are unfavorable for axon growth but that damaged CNS 
axons are capable of regenerating through peripheral nerve grafts2. 
Subsequent work identified some of the CNS factors responsible for 
inhibiting axon regrowth, including myelin-associated proteins3,4, 
reactive glial scarring5, upregulation of extracellular matrix factors6 
and repellant guidance cues7,8. Factors intrinsic to CNS neurons 
also prevent axon regeneration. For example, during development, 
CNS neurons downregulate expression of growth-promoting mol-
ecules9. Some CNS axon regeneration can be achieved by augmenting 
intrinsic cell growth-promoting factors such as mammalian target 
of rapamycin (mTOR), cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) 
or ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF)10–12, or by downregulating 
 
transcriptional inhibitors of axon growth such as Kruppel-like 
 
factor 4 (KLF4)13 or suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3)14. 
In general, it is thought that both extrinsic and intrinsic factors limit 
CNS axon regeneration15.
The eye-to-brain pathway consisting of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) 
connections to subcortical targets is a widely used model for studying 
vertebrate CNS regeneration2,10,13,16. After optic nerve crush (ONC), 
RGC axons fail to regenerate beyond the crush site, and eventually the 
RGCs die altogether17. Recent work showed that increasing mTOR 
signaling in RGCs by deletion of the gene encoding one of its inhibi-
tors, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), allows a substantial 
 
number of RGCs to regenerate their axons through lesions in the 
optic nerve10, an effect that is further enhanced by deletion of 
 
the gene encoding SOCS3 (ref. 18). However, neither Pten deletion 
nor combined Pten and Socs3 deletion stimulates regeneration of 
 
RGC axons back into the brain. Instead, the regenerating RGC axons 
stall at the optic chiasm10 or steer away from the brain and travel 
down the opposite optic nerve18,19, leaving RGCs divorced from 
 
their targets.
The purpose of this study was twofold. First, we sought to iden-
tify strategies that alone or in combination allow adult RGC axons 
to regenerate through the optic chiasm and back to the brain. We 
found that, if neural activity was enhanced along with levels of mTOR, 
RGC axons re-innervated their targets, including the most distal sub-
cortical visual nuclei. That discovery, in turn, allowed us to address 
 
a second major question: whether regenerating RGC axons have 
 
the ability to reconnect with their correct targets and restore visual 
function. Together, our data support the combined use of neural 
activity and molecular programs for intrinsic growth as strategies to 
regenerate visual circuits. Our results reveal the remarkable ability 
of adult CNS neurons to re-establish correct patterns of connectivity 
following injury.
RESULTS
Enhancement of RGC axon regeneration by visual stimulation
We lesioned RGC axons by crushing the optic nerve just posterior to 
the orbit of the eye using fine forceps (Fig. 1a). Three weeks later we 
labeled RGCs and their axons with intravitreal injections of cholera 
toxin subunit-� (CT�) conjugated to Alexa-Fluor-594 (CT�-594) 
(Fig. 1a,c,d). In the absence of any therapeutic intervention (group 1), 
 
very few RGC axons extended beyond the crush site (Fig. 1e) (control

Neural activity promotes long-distance, target-specific 
regeneration of adult retinal axons

Axons in the mammalian CNS fail to regenerate after injury. Here we show that if the activity of mouse retinal ganglion cells 
(RGCs) is increased by visual stimulation or using chemogenetics, their axons regenerate. We also show that if enhancement of 
neural activity is combined with elevation of the cell-growth-promoting pathway involving mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), 
RGC axons regenerate long distances and re-innervate the brain. Analysis of genetically labeled RGCs revealed that this regrowth 
can be target specific: RGC axons navigated back to their correct visual targets and avoided targets incorrect for their function. 
Moreover, these regenerated connections were successful in partially rescuing a subset of visual behaviors. Our findings indicate 
that combining neural activity with activation of mTOR can serve as powerful tool for enhancing axon regeneration, and they 
highlight the remarkable capacity of CNS neurons to re-establish accurate circuit connections in adulthood.

stimulation (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 4a–d). In the absence of 
CNO, expression of AAV2-hM4Di-mCitrine had no impact on RGC 
activity. Application of CNO, however, led to strong hyperpolarization 
and suppression of RGC spiking in response to current injection and 
visual stimulation (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 4a–d).
Next we applied the hM4Di strategy to test whether suppression 
of RGC activity would affect the axon regeneration caused by daily 
visual stimulation. We injected AAV-hM4Di-mCitrine into one eye, 
waited 2 weeks for expression, and then crushed the same eye’s optic 
nerve and systemically administered the mice CNO twice a day for 
 
3 weeks, while also exposing the animals to high-contrast visual stim-
ulation to drive RGC firing (Fig. 2d). Reducing RGC activity with 
hM4Di and CNO abolished the effect of visual stimulation on RGC 
axon regeneration and also reduced the total number of CT�-labeled 
RGC axons anterior to the lesion site (compare Fig. 2e with Fig. 1f) 
(Fig. 2k). These findings suggest that high-contrast visual stimula-
tion promotes regeneration of RGC axons by increasing their overall 
levels of electrical activation. The reduced number of CT�-labeled

died (Supplementary Fig. 2). This regenerative failure is consistent 
with hundreds of previous reports spanning many decades15. An 
earlier study showed that electrically stimulating developing RGCs 
 
in vitro accelerated outgrowth of their axons20. This inspired us to inves-
tigate whether enhancing the electrical activity of adult RGCs would 
promote regeneration of their axons in vivo. Vision is a potent stimulus 
for driving the electrical activity of RGCs. Thus, we examined whether 
exposing adult mice to high-contrast visual stimulation daily for 
 
3 weeks following ONC would trigger regeneration of RGC axons 
(Fig. 1b,c) (see Online Methods). This protocol (group 2) was effec-
tive in causing some RGC axons to regenerate a short distance past the 
lesion site (Fig. 1f), an effect that, while relatively limited in distance, 
was statistically significant compared to controls (Fig. 1g).
To further explore the influence of neural activity on axon regen-
eration, we employed chemogenetic technology21. First we tested 
whether reducing RGC activity would block the enhancement of 
RGC axon growth caused by visual stimulation. We overexpressed the 
engineered G-protein-coupled receptor hM4Di [Gi/o-coupled human 
muscarinic M4 designer receptor exclusively activated by a designer 
drug (DREADD)]21 in RGCs by injecting mice with adeno-associated- 
virus AAV2-hM4Di-mCitrine in one eye in vivo (Fig. 2a,b). 
Two weeks later, hM4Di-mCitrine-expressing cells were observed 
throughout the RGC layer (Supplementary Fig. 3a–d). They also 
expressed the marker RBPMS22, confirming them as RGCs (data not 
shown). When exposed to the synthetic ligand clozapine-N-oxide 
(CNO), hM4Di causes membrane hyperpolarization and silencing of 
CNS neurons21. We confirmed this in RGCs by targeting the AAV2-
hM4Di-mCitrine-infected RGCs for whole-cell current-clamp record-
ings of their responses to current injections and high-contrast visual

RGC axons anterior to the lesion site observed in mice that received 
hM4Di and CNO treatments also suggests that neural activity may 
affect the number of RGCs that survive optic nerve damage.
Next we tested whether chemogenetically increasing levels of RGC 
activity can promote their axons to regenerate. We overexpressed the 
CNO-sensitive synthetic receptor hM3Dq (Gq-coupled human mus-
carinic M3 DREADD)21 in RGCs by intravitreal injections of AAV2-
hM3Dq-mCitrine (Fig. 2f,g). Two weeks after injection, expression 
of hM3Dq-mCitrine was observed in all four quadrants of the RGC 
layer (Supplementary Fig. 3e–h) and co-labeling of these retinas 
with RBPMS22 showed that >90% of RGCs expressed the hM3Dq 
(Supplementary Fig. 3i–l). In whole-mount retinas from these 
mice, CNO-driven activation of the hM3Dq receptor caused a large 
increase in the number of spikes elicited from infected RGCs by cur-
rent injection or by high-contrast visual stimulation (Fig. 2h and 
Supplementary Fig. 4e–h).
What is the impact of chemogenetically enhancing neural activity 
on RGC axon regeneration? To test this, we injected a group of mice 
with AAV2-hM3Dq-mCitrine, crushed the optic nerve 2 weeks later 
and administered CNO twice a day for 3 weeks (Fig. 2f,i). To isolate 
the effects of hM3Dq-driven RGC activity, these mice were housed on 
normal light-dark cycles, with no additional visual stimulation. CT� 
labeling of RGC axons at the end of the 3-week chemogenetic stimula-
tion period revealed that hM3Dq and CNO treatments led to a greater 
degree of RGC axon regeneration (Fig. 2j,k) than occurred in control 
mice (group 1) or to mice that underwent daily visual stimulation alone 
(group 2) (Fig. 2k). A large number of hM3Dq-treated RGC regrew 
their axons through the lesion site in the proximal nerve, and indeed, 
some even extended into mid-optic nerve (Fig. 2j). These results indi-
cate that elevating RGC spiking levels is sufficient to promote axon 
regeneration and support the idea that visual stimulation exerts its 
influence on RGC axon regeneration by increasing levels of activity.
Synergistic effects of visual stimulation and mTOR elevation
Previous studies showed that increasing mTOR signaling by 
 
deletion of one of its repressors, PTEN, can trigger RGC axon 
 
regeneration10,16,18,19. Here we tested whether expressing a posi-
tive regulator of mTOR signaling, ras homolog enriched in brain 1 
(Rheb1) protein, also could promote regeneration. We injected AAV 
overexpressing constitutively active Rheb1 (AAV2-cRheb1)23 into one 
eye of adult mice, waited 2 weeks for cRheb1 overexpression, and 
then crushed the optic nerve of the AAV-injected eye. Three weeks 
later, we labeled RGC axons by intravitreal injection of CT�-594 and 
assessed their regeneration (Fig. 3a) (see Online Methods). Injections 
of AAV2-cRheb1 significantly increased the number of cells in the 
adult RGC layer that express phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein 
(p-S6), a downstream marker of phosphorylated mTOR activity 
 
(Fig. 3b–e and Supplementary Fig. 5).
Overexpression of cRheb1 enhanced the ability of adult RGCs to 
regenerate their axons after injury. Three weeks after ONC, we observed

treatment with AAV2-cRheb1 and crushing one optic nerve, suturing 
shut the eye corresponding to the non-lesioned optic nerve could 
further enhance RGC axon regeneration of the lesioned eye pathway 
(group 6). Biased use of the lesioned eye pathway in this manner 
 
enhanced RGC axon regeneration compared to group 3 mice treated 
with AAV2-cRheb1 alone (Supplementary Figs. 8b and 9a). However, 
 
if these mice were also exposed to high-contrast visual stimulation every 
day for 3 weeks (group 4; Fig. 3g and Supplementary Figs. 10–12), 
this combination of treatments (hereafter referred to as ‘biased visual 
stimulation/AAV2-cRheb1’) triggered long-distance regeneration 
 
of RGC axons. In 7 of 10 mice treated in this manner, RGC axons 
regenerated through the ONC site, down the full length of the 
optic nerve and into the optic chiasm (Fig. 3g and Supplementary

RGC axons extending through the lesion site 
and into the proximal optic nerve (Fig. 3f) 
(group 3), an effect that was statistically sig-
nificant compared to control mice receiving 
either (i) no treatment, (ii) intravitreal injec-
tions of saline or (iii) injections of a control 
virus (AAV2-Cre) (collectively, group 1) 
 
(Fig. 3h and Supplementary Fig. 1). The 
effects of AAV2-cRheb1 on RGC axon regen-
eration were attenuated by chronic adminis-
tration of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin 
(Supplementary Fig. 6), supporting the idea 
that the effect of AAV2-cRheb1 stemmed from 
elevation of mTOR signaling. Although there 
were quantitative differences in the overall 
 
number of axons that regenerated in response to cRheb1 overex-
pression versus visual stimulation versus Pten deletion (ref. 10 and 
Supplementary Fig. 7), the general patterns of regeneration observed 
in these three groups were similar: RGC axons regenerated past the 
lesion site but failed to grow the full distance of the optic nerve to reach 
the optic chiasm or brain (Fig. 3f,h and Supplementary Fig. 7).
Next we tested whether combining visual stimulation with enhanced 
mTOR signaling would increase the distance that RGC axons regener-
ate beyond that observed with either treatment alone. We injected one 
eye with AAV2-cRheb1 then allowed 2 weeks for elevation of mTOR 
signaling in RGCs. We then crushed the optic nerve and exposed the 
mice to high-contrast visual stimulation daily for 3 weeks (group 5; 
Supplementary Fig. 8a). In these mice, RGC axons regenerated past 
the lesion site but failed to extend beyond the mid-optic nerve and 
optic chiasm (Supplementary Figs. 8a and 9a).
In the motor system, forced use of an impaired limb promotes 
sprouting of corticospinal axons24. We therefore tested whether, after

the lesioned and AAV2-cRheb1 treated eye 
(group 7), the number of RGC axons that 
regenerated was similar to that of the group 3 
animals that received AAV2-cRheb1 treatment and, notably, no axons 
reached the optic chiasm (Supplementary Figs. 8c and 9a).
We found that the effect of the combined treatments also relied 
critically on cRheb1 overexpression of the RGCs. When the daily 
visual stimulation was biased toward the lesioned eye pathway but 
we did not overexpress cRheb1 (group 8), the number of RGC axons 
that regenerated was markedly reduced (Supplementary Figs. 8d 
and 9b). Further, in the absence of cRheb1 overexpression and visual 
stimulation (group 9), the number of regenerated RGC axons was 
significantly reduced (Supplementary Figs. 8e and 9b). This high-
lights the need for elevating intrinsic growth programs missing in 
mature RGCs9–12.
Together, the different combinations of treatments we designed 
to promote regeneration highlight the importance of providing 
visual stimulation to the AAV2-cRheb1 treated eye and they argue 
against indirect effects of the biased visual stimulation/AAV2-
cRheb1 protocol on nonvisual factors such as enhanced locomotion 
(Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figs. 8–12). We considered whether the 
enhanced axon regeneration we observed in mice given biased visual 
stimulation/AAV2-cRheb1 reflected an increase in RGC survival. 
 
The number of RGCs surviving ONC did indeed more than double in 
the biased visual stimulation/AAV2-cRheb1 group (Supplementary 
Fig. 13). The most parsimonious conclusion from all these 
 
experiments is that it is the combination of simultaneously enhancing 
 
activity and enhancing mTOR signaling that allows a set of RGC axons 
to regenerate through lesion sites and extend long distances down 
the optic nerve.
Long-range RGC axon regeneration to targets in the brain
A critical milestone for the re-establishment of functional eye-to-
brain circuits is long-distance regeneration of RGC axons back to the 
brain. The retinofugal pathway includes several dozen target nuclei 
located in the forebrain and midbrain (Fig. 4b and Supplementary 
Fig. 14)25. In mice receiving biased visual stimulation/AAV2-cRheb1 
treatments (group 4) (Fig. 4a,b), regenerated CT�-labeled RGC axons 
were observed in multiple subcortical visual targets (Fig. 4c–o). Seven 
of ten mice that received the biased visual stimulation/AAV2-cRheb1 
treatments had RGC axons that regenerated past the ONC site, 
through the optic chiasm and optic tract, and back to visual targets 
in the brain (Fig. 4c–o, Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 15). Three 
weeks after nerve crush, CT�-labeled RGC axons were observed in 
the most proximal visual target, the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic 
 
nucleus (SCN) (Fig. 4c,j), and in the thalamic ventral lateral geniculate 
nucleus (Fig. 4d,k) and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (Fig. 4e,l) (vLGN 
and dLGN, respectively). Regenerated RGC axons were also observed 
in midbrain pretectal nuclei such as the olivary pretectal nucleus (OPN) 
 
(Fig. 4f,m) and posterior limitans (Fig. 4g) and in accessory optic 
targets of the brainstem, such as the medial terminal nucleus (MTN)

(Fig. 4h,n). Remarkably, RGC axons were 
also detected in the subcortical visual target 
located furthest from the eye, the superior 
colliculus (SC) (Fig. 4i,o). Notably, we did 
not observe any CT�-labeled RGC axons 
in nonvisual subcortical regions such as 
the somatosensory or auditory thalamus 
(data not shown), indicating that regen-
erating RGC axons appropriately con-
fined their trajectories to the retinofugal 
 
pathway. The extent of RGC axon regen-
eration along the retinofugal pathway and 
within each target varied from one mouse 
to the next (Table 1). Nevertheless, in every 
animal receiving biased visual stimulation/
AAV2-cRheb1 treatment, the extent of 
regeneration was marked compared to mice 
treated only with AAV2-cRheb1 (group 3) or 
that received only visual stimulation but not AAV2-cRheb1 (group 2) 
 
(Figs. 1 and 3 and Table 1).
To ensure that the CT�-labeled axons we observed in the optic 
nerve and brain were regenerated axons and not spared RGC axons, 
we carried out several control experiments. For the first set of controls, 
we labeled RGC axons by intravitreal injections of CT�-594, and 2 d 
later we crushed the optic nerve. Then we waited 1 week, at which 
time we relabeled all RGC axons by intravitreal injection of CT�-488 
(Supplementary Fig. 16b). In every mouse examined, CT�-594 labeled 
axons were observed in the vicinity of the lesion site but never at the 
distal nerve or optic chiasm, contrary to abundantly labeled RGC axons 
down the entire length of the non-lesioned nerve (Supplementary 
 
Fig. 16a,c), indicating that the ONC indeed caused RGC axons to 
degenerate. Additionally, RGC axons labeled after the ONC with CT�-
488 were observed posterior to the eye and in the vicinity of the lesion 
site, but never in the mid- or distal optic nerve, optic chiasm or brain 
(Supplementary Fig. 16c and data not shown). These results support 
the conclusion that the ONC procedure did not spare RGC axons.
As a second set of controls, we tested whether the biased visual 
stimulation/AAV2-cRheb protocol induced RGC axons to regener-
ate down the optic nerve in a time-dependent manner, which would 
not occur if the crush procedure had spared RGC axons. For these 
experiments, we allowed the mice a period of either 1 or 2 weeks 
for RGC axons to regenerate before assessing the distance of axon 
growth (Supplementary Fig. 17a). In mice allowed to survive 
 
1 week after crush for regeneration to occur, RGC axons extended 
through and beyond the lesion site (Supplementary Fig. 17b), but 
were never observed in the distal nerve or in central visual targets 
(Supplementary Fig. 18a–d). In mice allowed 2 weeks for regen-
eration to occur, there were an even greater number of RGC axons 
 
growing through the lesion site (Supplementary Fig. 17c,d); some 
RGC axons were observed in the mid- and distal optic nerve but 
no axons were observed in the chiasm or the brain (Supplementary 
 
Fig. 17c,d). Only in mice treated with biased visual stimulation/
AAV2-cRheb1 and allowed a minimum of 3 weeks for regeneration 
did we observe RGC axons regenerating through the optic chiasm 
and back into the brain (Figs. 3 and 4).
Together, these two sets of control experiments support the conclu-
sion that our nerve crush procedure did not spare RGC axons. Rather, 
the CT�-labeled profiles observed in the optic nerve, chiasm and 
brain represent RGC axons that regrew in a time-dependent manner 
through and beyond the crush site.
Target-specific axon regeneration in the brain
A critical unresolved issue in the field of CNS regeneration is whether 
regrowing axons can find and reconnect to their correct targets. 
 
The growth of RGC axons back into the brain we observed in mice 
receiving biased visual stimulation/AAV2-cRheb1 treatment (Figs. 3 
and 4), provided us the opportunity to address this issue. Mammals, 
including mice and humans, have ~30 types of RGCs25, each of which 
responds to a particular feature in the visual world and connects to a 
small subset of the 40-plus retinorecipient targets. Our laboratory and 
others have created and/or characterized various transgenic mouse 
lines, each harboring green fluorescent protein (GFP) in specific 
RGC types25,26. When combined with the axon-regrowth protocol 
 
described above, these mice offer a powerful opportunity to explore 
the specificity of RGC axon regeneration. Others have shown that 
mTOR-induced regeneration is biased toward �-RGC types27. 
We made use of a new mouse line: cochlin-GFP (CoCH-GFP). In these 
mice many of the GFP-expressing RGCs are �-RGCs (Supplementary 
Fig. 19) and we tested whether GFP+ RGCs regenerated their axons 
back to their correct targets in the brain.
In normal non-lesioned mice, CoCH-GFP+ RGC axons densely 
innervate the vLGN, dLGN, OPN and SC, and they avoid the SCN, 
MTN and intergeniculate leaflet (IGL) (Fig. 5b and Supplementary 
Fig. 19). In optic-nerve-lesioned CoCH-GFP mice treated with 
biased visual stimulation and AAV2-cRheb1 (Fig. 5a), a subset of 
the CT�-594+ axons in the optic nerve also expressed CoCH-GFP 
(Supplementary Fig. 20) indicating they indeed are part of the 
regenerating cohort. CT�-594-labeled RGC axons were observed 
in various retinorecipient targets in the brain, including the SCN, 
vLGN, dLGN, MTN and SC (Fig. 5c–l,o–u). Remarkably, the 
only targets that contained axons that were double-labeled with 
both CT�-594 and CoCH-GFP (i.e., regenerated CoCH-GFP+ 
RGC axons) were those targets that normally receive input from 
CoCH-GFP+ RGCs, namely the vLGN (Fig. 5f–h), the dLGN 
(Fig. 5i–k), the OPN (Fig. 5l–n) and the SC (Fig. 5u–w). Thus, 
regeneration of CoCH-GFP+ RGC axons was target-specific. 
Moreover, the regenerated CoCH-GFP+ RGC axons avoided vis-
ual targets they normally fail to innervate: the SCN, the nucleus 
of the optic tract (NOT) and the MTN. Although these targets 
contained CT�-594 labeled RGC axons (Fig. 5c,o,r), indicating 
they are capable of accepting regenerated RGC axons, none of the 
regenerated axons expressed GFP (Fig. 5d,e,p,q,s,t), indicating 
 
they arose from other, non-CoCH-GFP+ RGC types.

A R T I C L E S
To investigate whether other types of RGCs 
reconnect to appropriate targets, we exam-
ined regeneration in OPN4-GFP mice. OPN4 
is expressed by a subpopulation of RGCs—
so-called intrinsically photosensitive RGCs 
(ipRGCs)—that are thought to be more ame-
nable to regeneration27,28. In normal non-lesioned mice, the axons 
of OPN4-GFP+ RGCs heavily target the SCN, vLGN, IGL and OPN, 
while minimally targeting the dLGN and SC. OPN4-GFP+ RGC axons 
avoid the MTN entirely (ref. 28 and Supplementary Fig. 21). The 
biased visual stimulation/AAV2-cRheb1 protocol induced a subset of 
OPN4-GFP+ RGC axons to regenerate back to the brain, where they 
reinnervated several correct targets such as the IGL (Supplementary 
Fig. 22j–l) and avoided incorrect targets such as the NOT and MTN 
(Supplementary Fig. 22p–r).
In the brains of both CoCH-GFP mice and OPN4-GFP mice, 
 
we observed GFP+ axons that were not labeled with CT�-594. To 
test the assumption that the GFP+CT�− axons arose from the retina 
that was treated with AAV-Rheb1 and not from any other source 
(Fig. 5h,k,n,w), we injected AAV2-cRheb1 into one eye of CoCH-
GFP mice, nerve crushed the AAV2-cRheb1 eye and then enucle-
ated the opposite eye, forcing its RGC axons to degenerate. We 
then provided biased visual stimulation through the remaining eye 
every day for 3 weeks to trigger regrowth of RGC axons (Fig. 6a,b). 
In this experiment, any CT�+GFP+ axons observed in the brain 
must have originated from the lesioned and treated eye. Six of nine 
mice in this group (group 10) exhibited regenerated CoCH-GFP+ 
axons in the optic nerve and chiasm (Fig. 6c), as well as the vLGN 
 
(Fig. 6d–f), dLGN (Fig. 6g–i) and SC (Fig. 6j–l and Table 1). 
Notably, all the regenerated CoCH-GFP+ axons were labeled 
with CT�-594, indicating they regenerated from the lesioned eye. 
Together, our experiments on regrowth and steering of axons from 
GFP-labeled RGCs reveal the remarkable capacity of adult CNS 
axons to navigate back to and re-innervate their correct targets 
in the brain when provided with the appropriate combination of 
regeneration-inducing stimuli.
Functional restoration of visual behaviors
To test whether the regenerated RGC connections described above 
can support visual function, we assayed behavioral performance in 
four different tests of visual function25. The optokinetic reflex (OKR) 
probes the function of the AOS connections to the oculomotor 
brainstem29, the pupillary light reflex (PLR) probes retino-pretectal 
connection to the OPN shell30, the visual cliff test probes the retino-
geniculo-cortical pathway31, and the looming avoidance response 
probes the retino-collicular pathway32–34. We tested three groups 
of mice: a pure-control non-lesioned group, a unilaterally optic- 
nerve-lesioned group that received no regeneration-enhancing 
treatment (‘lesioned and untreated’) and a lesioned and treated 
group (identical to group 4 above) that received the biased visual 
stimulation/AAV2-cRheb1 treatments capable of inducing long-
range axon regrowth into the brain (see Online Methods) (Fig. 7a–c). 
To ensure that any observed functional recovery was mediated by regen-
erated RGC connections originating from the lesioned eye and not by 
RGCs from the non-lesioned eye, we sutured shut the non-lesioned eye. 
The only exception to this was during testing of the consensual PLR, 
where, by requirement, both eyes had to be kept open (see below).
First we assessed the OKR, in which animals generate slip- 
compensating head movements in response to drifting gratings 
 
moving along the horizontal axis (Fig. 7d). As described 
 
previously35,36 we quantified the percentage of 15-s trials in which 
the animals successfully tracked the stimulus (see Online Methods). 
The non-lesioned group tracked ~33% of the stimulus trials (n = 5 
animals)—a value lower than is typical in binocularly sighted mice 
but still far greater than observed in the lesioned and untreated group, 
which failed to track any stimulus trials (n = 5 animals) (Fig. 7e). The 
lesioned and treated mice, by contrast, tracked ~23% of the stimulus

trials (n = 3 animals), which was significantly 
more than the lesioned and untreated group 
and approached the percentage tracked by the 
non-lesioned group (Fig. 7e). This indicates 
that regenerated RGC axons can partially 
restore OKR behavior.
Next we measured the PLR, a behavior 
driven by ipRGC projections to the OPN 
shell30,37,38. The PLR has both a direct compo-
nent and a consensual component. The direct 
PLR represents constriction of the pupil in the 
illuminated eye. The consensual response is 
the constriction of the pupil in the opposite 
eye, mediated by interhemispheric connec-
tions (Supplementary Fig. 23). We recorded 
both the direct and consensual PLR to ipRGC-
optimized blue light stimulation of the lesioned 
eye at 25 lx for 30 s (refs. 30,38) (Fig. 7f,g). 
Measuring the consensual PLR required open-
ing the previously sutured eye at the time of 
testing. Both the direct and consensual response was markedly reduced 
by ONC (Fig. 7h,i). Restoration of the direct constriction response in 
the lesioned eye was increased compared to no treatment, but this was 
not statistically significant (Fig. 7h). There was no difference in direct 
(Fig. 7h) or consensual pupil constriction (Fig. 7i) between the treated 
and untreated groups, indicating that the regenerated RGC axons in the 
treated group failed to rescue the consensual pupil constriction.
Next we performed the visual cliff test to assess depth perception 
and the functional integrity of the retino-geniculo-cortical pathway31. 
We placed each mouse on a platform, below which the floor on one 
side was painted with a low spatial frequency pattern of large black 
squares while the other was painted with a high-spatial-frequency 
pattern of small black squares. This creates an illusion of a shallow 
versus deep drop from the platform, respectively (Fig. 7j; see Online 
Methods). Normal non-lesioned mice chose to step down on the 
perceived shallow side of the chamber in ~70% of trials, an effect 
that disappeared in mice with lesions to their optic nerves regardless 
of whether they received a treatment to induce regeneration or not 
 
(Fig. 7k). This indicates that the regeneration resulting from biased 
visual stimulation/AAV2-cRheb1 treatment failed to restore the 
connections that mediate visual cliff avoidance behavior. This could 
reflect defects in synapse formation and/or insufficient numbers of 
axons regenerating to the dLGN (discussed below).
Finally, we assayed the visual fear response of animals to an over-
head looming stimulus. In these experiments, animals are placed 
into a chamber equipped with a shelter in which to hide and then a 
rapidly expanding black circle (the looming stimulus) is presented 
from the top of the chamber (Fig. 7l; see Online Methods)32. Upon

presentation of the looming stimulus, normal mice either immedi-
ately froze or ran under the shelter (Fig. 7m)32. By contrast, none 
of the lesioned and untreated animals responded to the looming 
stimulus; they simply continued exploring the chamber (Fig. 7m). 
In the lesioned and treated group, two of three mice responded to 
the looming stimulus appropriately by running under the shelter to 
hide (Fig. 7m) and the third mouse responded to looming stimulus 
 
by orienting its head and eyes upward each time the looming 
 
stimulus was presented, but never by freezing or hiding, indicating 
it perceived the stimulus despite its failure to engage the appropriate 
behavioral response. Overall, these results indicate that biased visual 
stimulation/cRheb1 treatments lead to regrowth of RGC axons that, 
in turn, can sustain partial recovery of some visual functions and 
vision-driven behaviors.

A R T I C L E S
adult mice. These results indicate that, under the appropriate condi-
tions, mature RGCs are capable of regrowing axons into the brain and 
forming connections with appropriate target neurons. This regenera-
tion leads to partial recovery of several visual functions, suggesting 
that some degree of functional synapse re-formation can take place 
in the adult visual pathway.
Biased visual activity as a trigger for RGC axon growth
The greatest degree of regeneration was observed in mice that received 
enhanced RGC activity and unilateral lid suture (or eye removal) to 
eliminate vision through the non-lesioned eye pathway. Why might 
this be so? Complete optic nerve lesions, as used here, eliminate the 
opportunity for binocular interactions among RGC axons located 
within central visual targets. Thus, the observed effects of unilateral 
visual bias may arise from one or several other sources. One possibility 
 
is that the bias effect is purely behavioral; that is, suturing shut the 
non-lesioned eye encouraged animals to keep the opposite, lesioned 
eye open, which in turn promoted more spiking activity in those 
RGCs. The reduced amount of regeneration observed in control 
animals where AAV2-cRheb1 and visual stimulation were provided 
through both eyes (as well as the controls that experienced no visual 
stimulation) support this idea. Another possibility is that, even though 
crushing the optic nerve triggers degeneration of RGC axons, their 
degeneration is not instantaneous but takes place over 1–3 d follow-
ing the crush. Thus, there may be a short window whereby binocular 
interactions driven by biased visual activity could boost or accelerate 
pathways controlling RGC regeneration in the open, lesioned eye. 
Regardless of the mechanism, the impact of biased visual stimula-
tion on RGC axon regrowth is evident from our data because only in 
animals where one eye was sutured shut or removed did we observe 
long-distance regeneration of cRheb1-treated RGC axons from the 
unsutured, intact eye.
In theory, visual stimulation could influence RGC axon regenera-
tion by non-activity-dependent means, although the downstream 
mechanisms for that process are not clear at this time. However, 
our findings that a reduction in RGC activity via hM4Di and CNO 
prevents visual-stimulation-mediated axon regeneration and that 
increasing RGC activity with hM3Dq and CNO promotes axon regen-
eration support the idea that RGC activity levels are a key parameter 
regulating axon growth after injury. Increasing activity in ipRGCs 
has recently been shown to enhance RGC regrowth down the optic 
nerve but not regrowth into the brain39, and electrical stimulation has 
been shown to prolong RGC both survival and function in various 
models of ophthalmic disease40. Thus, there is growing evidence that 
electrical activity is a key parameter adjusting the regrowth potential 
of CNS neurons.
Regrowth distance of RGC axons with various treatments
Our study demonstrates the remarkable capacity of adult CNS 
 
neurons to regenerate their axons long distances, if they are treated 
with the appropriate growth-stimulating conditions. We found that 
enhanced RGC activity coupled with elevated mTOR signaling 
allowed axons to regenerate down the full length of the optic nerve 
and indeed all the way into the brain. We note that other experi-
ments that elevate mTOR signaling, such as deletion of the mTOR 
inhibitor gene Pten trigger an even greater number of RGC axons 
to regenerate than we observed here. One possible reason for this 
is that Cre recombination is all or none whereas cRheb1 expression 
may vary between infected RGCs and thus induce varying levels of 
p-S6 expression. However, we note that while Pten deletion causes 
RGC axons to grow as far as the optic chiasm, it does not allow them 
to grow into the brain10 unless it is combined with one or more other 
treatments16 (Figs. 3–6). Together, these data underscore the fact 
that multiple treatments applied in combination are needed to trigger 
regeneration of RGC axons back into the brain, and they encourage 
 
additional exploration of the molecular pathways activated down-
stream of neural activity.
Specificity of axon regeneration in the mature CNS
By exploring genetically labeled RGC types—the �-RGCs or ipRGCs—
we found that RGCs had a remarkable capacity to reconnect to their 
correct targets in the brain while simultaneously avoiding incorrect 
targets. The fact that CoCH-GFP+ RGC axons are among the regen-
erating cohort is consistent with the previous work that identified 
cat �-RGCs as the main group undergoing regeneration after sciatic 
nerve transplants41. These results are also in agreement with those of a 
recent study showing that �-RGCs account for the majority of regen-
erating axons following Pten deletion27. We note that we observed 
many regenerated CT�+ RGC axons, which were not GFP+ and which 
targeted brain areas not typically innervated by �-RGCs (Figs. 4–6). 
This suggests that elevation of mTOR signaling with enhancement 
of RGC activity may recruit regeneration of not only �-RGCs, but 
also other RGC types. The ability of OPN4-GFP+ axons to regenerate 
supports this idea, and in the future it will be interesting to explore 
the regeneration capacity of other RGC types as well.
The fact that some RGCs are capable of re-innervating the correct 
brain targets is remarkable, and yet it not entirely surprising when one 
considers that others have observed target-specific re-innervation in 
other systems. Björklund and co-workers observed that when the inhib-
itory effects of oligodendrocytes and myelin were neutralized, striatal 
and cortical projection neurons regenerated their axons long distances 
to re-innervate several of their correct targets in the substantia nigra, 
pontine nuclei and cervical spinal cord42. More recently, Frank and 
co-workers observed that the central branch of lesioned dorsal root 
ganglion neurons undergo lamina-specific regeneration into the dorsal 
horn43. Collectively, these studies suggest that, in mammals, ligands and 
receptors that are expressed to ensure CNS axons arrive at and innervate 
their proper targets during development29,35 may still be present, or 
even upregulated, in response to RGC axon injury and/or regenera-
tion in adulthood. Indeed, such upregulation of guidance molecules in 
response to injury has been observed in the tectum (corresponding to 
the mammalian superior colliculus) of cold-blooded vertebrates44. It will 
be important to address this by exploring the molecular pathways that 
are activated in the RGC types that regenerate in our activity protocol. 
In addition, it will be interesting to see whether we can bias regrowth of 
different RGC types and evaluate their targeting by providing activity 
patterns tailored to their specific receptive field properties.
Functional and clinical implications
There are important functional implications of the anatomical 
regeneration we observed at the level of visual reflexes and behav-
iors. Combining elevation of mTOR signaling with enhancement of 
RGC activity proved effective in partially restoring visual function in 
two out of the four visual assays we used. Curiously, the behaviors in 
which we observed recovery were those driven by the accessory optic 
system (optokinetic reflex)29,35 and retino-SC connections (the loom-
ing avoidance response)34 while the assays where we failed to observe 
any recovery were the pupil response (retino-OPN connection)30  
and visual cliff test. The first three behaviors involve retino-subcorti-
cal pathways and do not require the cortex25 whereas the visual-cliff 
depth perception task depends on binocular vision and thus involves 
the dLGN and primary visual cortex (V1)31. The lack of recovery in

A R T I C L E S
the visual cliff task was somewhat surprising given that we observed 
regeneration of RGC axons to the dLGN, the nucleus that relays 
visual information to V1. The threshold for functional recovery of 
the retino-geniculo-cortical pathway may therefore be higher than 
that of the other retinofugal parallel pathways at the level of synapse 
formation and/or precision of within-target wiring. Indeed, retin-
otopic and spatial precision of connections may not be a prerequisite 
for pathways driving OKR or looming since they involve large-field 
illumination, whereas visual cliff tasks require analysis of spatial fre-
quency and thus higher resolution image-formation.
Interestingly, we observed regeneration of RGC axons to the OPN, 
the nucleus that modulates the PLR, but we did not observe any 
substantial recovery of direct or consensual pupil constriction. It is, 
however, worth noting that we intentionally used low light inten-
sities to stimulate the PLR so as not to allow spillover of light to 
 
the opposite, non-lesioned eye. Although this was critical to avoid 
potential confounds, it is possible that higher light intensities could 
have driven functional activation of the PLR through the regener-
ated pathway connections. Regardless, our behavioral data support 
a model in which restoration of neural pathways for visual function 
and perception may require a large number of RGCs to regenerate. 
In addition, a recent study probed the functional recovery of retino-
collicular connections after distal nerve cut lesions and found that 
anatomical regeneration occurred without functional restoration45. 
Only by enhancing neural activity in regenerating RGCs did their 
axons recruit myelinating glia—just as RGCs do during develop-
ment46—and allow functional transmission between RGCs and their 
targets45. Thus, additional sources of enhancing neural activity, in 
particular within the RGC populations that target the dLGN, may 
prove important for enhancing regeneration of mature central visual 
pathways and visual perception.
In conclusion, our findings demonstrating long-distance axon 
regeneration, specificity of connections and partial recovery of visual 
 
function may prove informative for devising treatments for the 
 
damaged visual system, spinal cord or other CNS regions in patients 
suffering from neurodegenerative diseases or physical trauma.

ONLINE METHODS
Subjects. Mice of either sex ranging in age from postnatal day 30 to P80 were 
used, including seven strains: wild-type mice with no GFP (C57BL/6) (from The 
Jackson Laboratory); Cochlin-EGFP mice (CoCH-GFP) (from MMRRC), Opsin 
4 (melanopsin)-EGFP mice (OPN4-GFP) (from MMRRC) and Ptenfl/fl mice, 
all of which were maintained on a C57BL/6 background. Mice were assigned to 
groups based on genotype (Figs. 5 and 6) or randomly selected for control or 
experimental groups (Figs. 1–4). Group sample sizes were chosen on the basis 
of previous studies10,14,18. Animals were housed on a 12-h light/dark cycle and 
behavioral analyses were done at consistent afternoon hours during the light 
cycle. All experiments and procedures were done in accordance with approved 
animal protocols from APLAC and IACCUC committees at the University of 
California, San Diego.
Intravitreal injections of viruses and tracers. The following dyes and viruses 
were injected into the vitreal chamber of the eye using a Hamilton syringe as 
described previously26: the anterograde tracer cholera toxin subunit-� (CT�) 
conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (CT�–594; Invitrogen) or to Alexa Fluor 488 
 
(CT�-488; Invitrogen) to label RGC axons; adeno-associated virus serotype 
2/1 with constitutively active Rheb1 (AAV2/1-cRheb1, 6 × 1010 ifu/ml) to 
overexpress cRheb1; adeno-associated virus serotype 2 with hM4Di (rAAV2/
hSyn-HA-hM4D(Gi)-IRES-mCitrine, 5.6 × 1012 vg/ml) and hM3Dq (rAAV2/
hSyn-HA-hM3D(Gq)-IRES-mCitrine, 5.1 × 1012 vg/ml) (Gene Therapy Vector 
Core, UNC, NC) to overexpress hM4Di and hM3Dq, respectively; adeno-associated 
 
virus serotype 2 with Cre (AAV2-iCre, 1 × 1013 GC/ml) (Vector Biolabs) to knock 
out Pten gene in Ptenfl/fl mice or to use C57BL/6 mice for AAV control group 
after optic nerve crush. Injections were done using the following procedure: mice 
were anesthetized with inhalant isoflurane and a small hole was made near the ora 
serrata. The injection was made with a 33 gauge Hamilton needle and complete-
ness of the eye fill was confirmed under a fluorescence dissecting microscope. 
CT�-injected animals were given a 2-d survival period to allow the tracer to travel 
down and label RGC axons and their terminals. After AAV2-cRheb1 or AAV2-
hM4Di or AAV2-hM3Dq injections, we waited 2 weeks for the virus to express in 
the RGC population. All virus injections were performed with the experimenter 
blind to treatment conditions.
Intraperitoneal injection of rapamycin. Rapamycin (LC Laboratories; dissolved 
at 20 mg/ml in ethanol) was administered as described previously10. Before 
each administration, rapamycin was diluted in 5% Tween 80, 5% polyethylene 
glycol 400 (0.5–1.5 mg/ml). Rapamycin at 6 mg/kg or the vehicle (5% Tween 
80, 5% polyethylene glycol 400 in PBS) was injected intraperitoneally after the 
AAV2-cRheb1 injection on the first day and then every 2 d for the duration 
 
of the experiment.
Intraperitoneal injection of clozapine-N-oxide. Clozapine-N-oxide (Tocris 
Bioscience; dissolved at 1 mg/ml in DMSO (0.5%)/saline) was administered as 
described previously21. CNO (1 mg/kg for the hM3Dq group and 5 mg/kg for 
the hM4Di group) was administered intraperitoneally twice each day for the 
duration of the experiment.
Optic nerve crush surgery. Animals were sedated by subcutaneous injection of 
ketamine/xylazine solution (1 ml of ketamine (100 mg/ml) and 0.625 ml of xyla-
zine (20 mg/ml) in 8.375 ml of saline) at 1 �l per gram body weight. Jeweler’s fine 
forceps (Dumont #5, FST) were used to expose the optic nerve intraorbitally and 
crushed for 5 s at a distance approximately 2 mm from the posterior pole of the 
eye10. We carefully avoided damaging the ophthalmic artery and monitored the eye 
for any signs of bleeding in the period immediately after and for several hours and 
days following the crush. Ointment containing atropine sulfate (Bausch and Lomb, 
NDC 24208-825-55) was applied pre- and postoperatively to protect the cornea 
from drying. Any mice with vascular damage in the eye after optic nerve surgery 
were euthanized immediately after and were not included in the dataset.
Visual stimulation. Mice were placed into a chamber surrounded by four 
 
23-inch widescreen LCD monitors facing each other. The mice were exposed 
 
to high-contrast (black and white) vertical lines drifting horizontally, 45- or 
 
270-degree lines moving up and to the right or down and to the left, and hori-
zontal lines moving vertically. The stimulus was delivered for 12–14 h a day 
for the 21 d after optic nerve crush and was delivered during animals’ wake 
time. Stimuli were powered by Optomotry VR 1.7.7 (CerebralMechanics Inc., 
Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada).
Eyelid suture or eye removal. After the animals were sedated, the margins of one 
eyelid were trimmed slightly and the upper and lower lids were sutured together 
using nylon monofilament suture. To ensure that sutures remained intact, a drop 
of ophthalmic surgical bond was applied. To remove an eye, the animals were 
first sedated and, using curved surgical scissors (ROBOZ, RS-5675), the eye 
was elevated slightly from the orbit and the optic nerve cut and eye removed. 
Afterward, the orbit was sutured shut.
Immunohistochemistry. After transcardial perfusion with saline (0.9% NaCl 
diluted in ddH2O) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), the eyes, optic nerves 
and brain were harvested and postfixed in 4% PFA for 24 h. The eyes were then 
transferred to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and the optic nerve and brain placed 
in 30% sucrose for cryoprotection. The optic nerve was sectioned using a sledge 
microtome, cutting longitudinally at 15 �m. The brain was sectioned coronally 
at 30 �m. All tissue sections were included in the analysis. Retinas, optic nerves 
and brain tissue were kept at 4 °C overnight with the following antibodies: rabbit-
anti-RBPMS (PhosphoSolutions, 1:1,000, Cat. No. 1830-RBPMS)), to label RGCs; 
rabbit or guinea pig anti-GFP (SySy; 1:1,000, Cat. No. 132 003), to enhance GFP 
signal; rabbit-anti-p-S6 (Cell Signaling Technology; 1:250, Cat. No. 4858S), to label 
phosphorylated S6 protein; mouse anti-SMI-32 (Sternberger Monoclonals, 1:2,000, 
 
Cat. No. NE1023) to label �-RGCs and other large-soma RGC types; rabbit anti-
melanopsin (Advanced Targeting Systems, 1:1,000, Cat. No. AB-N38). For secondary 
detection, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit (1:1,000, Invitrogen, Cat. No. A-11012), 
Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-guinea pig (1:1,000, Invitrogen, Cat. No. A-11075), 
 
or Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit (1:1,000; Invitrogen, Cat. No. A-11012) were 
used. Immunostained tissues were imaged with an epifluorescence microscope 
(Zeiss Axio imager 2 with HR Zeiss camera, 10× and 20× objectives).
Cell number quantification. We compared p-S6 expression (cell numbers) 
in the retinas of AAV2-cRheb1-injected animals and control animals injected 
with saline. After we immunostained the retinas with identical protocols 
 
for the downstream marker of phosphorylated mTOR, p-S6, each flat- 
mount retina was imaged with an epifluorescence microscope. Multiple 
 
500 �m × 500 �m regions of the retina were analyzed for each animal (n = 5 
mice per group). Photoshop (Adobe, CS6) was used to convert each image 
to grayscale and to threshold the image to eliminate background noise (same 
thresholds applied). Each p-S6+ profile was then counted and included in the 
analysis. Using the same analysis, we also quantified the number of RGCs 
in different experimental conditions by immunostaining the retinas for the 
RGC marker RBPMS22.
Axon quantification in the optic nerve. After we imaged the serial optic nerve 
sections, Photoshop (Adobe, CS6) was used to stitch the images into a complete 
montage. Lines spaced equidistant from each other at 500-�m intervals from 
the rear of the eye to the optic chiasm were introduced to the montage for bin- 
by-bin axon quantification. We manually counted the number of individual axons 
that transected each vertical line. As used by other groups10,16, we quantified 
the total number of regenerating axons, �ad, by using the following formula: 
 
�ad = �r2x[average axons/mm]/t, where total number of axons extending distance 
 
d in a nerve having a radius of r was estimated by summing over all sections 
with thickness t (in our case, 15 �m). The axon counts were verified by a blind- 
to-condition, independent viewer.
Electrophysiology. Procedures were similar to those described previously35. 
Briefly, retinas were collected and dissected in gassed (95% O2 and 5% CO2) 
Ames medium (Sigma) under infrared illumination and cut along the dorsal-
ventral axis. Only ventral pieces were used. A piece of retina was placed in a 
chamber on an upright microscope and superfused (~5 ml/min) with gassed 
Ames medium heated to 33–35 °C. RGCs expressing mCitrine were visualized 
at 40× by attenuated mercury light passed through a GFP dichroic mirror and 
then targeted for recording under infrared illumination. Cells were recorded with 
borosilicate glass pipettes (4–6 M�) filled with intracellular solution contain-
ing (in mM) 120 potassium methanesulfonate, 10 HEPES, 5 NaCl, 0.1 EGTA,

Current-evoked spiking responses were recorded in response to a series of 
ten monotonically increasing 20 pA current steps. The baseline current step 
used for analysis varied between cells (20–80 pA) but was always the small-
est step that produced at least one spike under control conditions. Patterned 
light stimuli were generated by custom software developed in Psychophysics 
Toolbox and MATLAB. Stimuli were projected onto the retina using a Dell 
video projector (M109s DLP) custom fitted with a UV LED (NC4U134A; final 
emission, 398 nm; Nichia), attenuated by a neutral density 1.0 filter and focused 
using a 10× objective to the level of rod and cone outer segments. Stimulus 
intensity produced 2.6 × 105 R*/S-cone s−1. Stable S-cone mediated responses 
can be recorded from RGCs in the ventral mouse retina following targeting by 
epifluorescence under these conditions. The receptive field center was mapped 
by recording responses to square-wave modulations of a 300-�m-diameter 
spot at eight positions. In subsequent experiments, stimuli were presented 
as a contrast pulse (100% Weber contrast), 200–400 microns in diameter. 
 
The same size stimulus was always used for both control and CNO recordings 
for a given cell.
Behavioral analyses. Optokinetic reflex. Mice were placed on an elevated platform 
surrounded by four 23-inch widescreen LCD monitors. Each trial consisted of 
vertical drifting-bar stimuli presented at a spatial frequency of 0.16 cycles per 
degree and temporal frequence of 12° s−1, the optimal stimulus for driving the 
OKR35,36. Each trial lasted 15 s; if the head of the mouse moved in concert with 
the gratings, the trial was scored as “tracked.” Each mouse was presented with 
10 trials per day, for 3 consecutive days, at the same time of day. Responses were 
averaged to generate a mean percentage of trials tracked (n = 3–5 mice per group; 
see main text).
Pupillary light reflex. Mice were dark-adapted within their home cage for 1 h 
before the experiment. All mice were unanesthetized and restrained by hand for 
the duration of the experiment. A single blue (470 nm) LED was placed in front of 
the stimulated eye. Both the direct (stimulated eye) and consensual (contralateral 
eye) PLR were recorded with two infrared video cameras placed on either side 
of the head. The pupils were recorded before (baseline) and during (constric-
tion) the light stimulus (30 s at 25 lx). The light intensity was chosen as 25 lx to 
prevent light spillover to the other eye. Individual frames of the initial resting 
pupil size (baseline) and at maximal constriction were extracted from the video 
recordings and pupil diameters were measured using ImageJ. The percentage of 
the pupil constriction30,38 was calculated from the pupil diameter measurements 
at the initial resting size and maximal constriction (n = 3–5 mice per group; see 
main text).
Visual cliff. The visual cliff behavior was analyzed in an open-top Plexiglas 
chamber. Half of the box protruded from the counter to provide a 3-foot 
depth. The box on the counter displayed a base with a checkerboard pattern 
and the box off the counter showed the base with the same checkerboard 
pattern, except for the 3 feet of depth. A 2-foot-high platform was stationed 
in the middle of the box intersecting both the shallow side and deep side. 
 
The mouse was placed on top of the platform and allowed to choose between 
the two sides. If the mouse stepped down to the shallow side, that trial was 
scored as “relative depth perceived.” If the mouse either stepped down to the 
deep side or stayed on top of the platform for 5 min, that trial was scored as 
“relative depth not perceived.” Each mouse performed this task 5 times per 
day for 3 d. The visual cliff behavior was averaged to generate mean per-
centage of trials in which the mouse chose to step down to the shallow side 
 
(n = 3–5 mice per group; see main text).
Looming response behavior analysis. The looming response is a well- 
documented behavior in which mice freeze or flee to an escape area in response 
to a dark expanding disk overhead32,34. This analysis was performed with mice 
in an open-top Plexiglas chamber. A 24-inch LCD monitor was stationed on top 
of the chamber facing downward to display the stimulus. One end of the box 
included a black shelving board to provide a shelter in which to hide. A video 
camera recorded the mouse’s movements during the trial at 30 fps. The mouse was 
free to roam inside the box for 5 min before the first presentation of the stimulus. 
The looming stimulus was presented three times during a 3-s epoch. If the mouse 
responded to the stimulus by either freezing or hiding in the shelter, that trial was 
scored as “looming response.” Each animal performed the task once. Looming 
responses as a percentage of total looming stimulus presentations were averaged 
for each animal as to generate a mean percentage of trials responded (n = 3–5 
mice per group; see main text).
Statistics. Statistical tests indicated in our study were performed using Prism 7 
(GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). In addressing our hypothesis that visual stim-
ulation alone or together with cRheb1 overexpression and/or other manipulations 
can enhance axon regeneration, we tested the increases in RGC axon regeneration 
by one-tailed t-test. Continuous data were tested with parametric tests and data 
were assumed to be normally distributed, but this was not formally tested.

CONCLUSIONS 
The work presented here describes a novel strategy to enhance axon regeneration 
of mature CNS neurons and restore circuitry after severe nerve lesions. Chapter 1 
highlighted the importance of visual stimulation-driven neural activity and cell growth-
promoting pathway - mTOR - in triggering long-distance regeneration of RGC axons 
after unilateral optic nerve crush. Chapter 1 further revealed that the regenerating RGC 
axons mostly stayed on course to re-innervate their correct visual targets in the brain, 
which induced partial restoration of subset of visual behaviors. These findings can 
contribute to better understanding of the cellular mechanisms of regenerating CNS 
neurons after acute injury and can potentially be applied to a clinical setting to treat 
human patients suffering from traumatic brain injury or neurodegenerative disease. 
 
Neural activity regulates axon regrowth after injury 
 
It is possible that chronic application of visual stimulation could enhance axon 
regeneration by mechanisms other than elevation of neural activity, but the downstream 
mechanisms for that process need to be further investigated. During development, neural 
activity regulates axon branching by modifying actin cytoskeleton dynamics (Ohnami et 
al., 2008). In our study, chronically attenuating RGC activity abolished visual 
stimulation-mediated axon regeneration while chronically increasing RGC activity alone 
promoted axon regeneration after optic nerve crush, supporting the role of neural activity 
in regulating axon growth after injury. It is also worth noting that the amount of RGC 
axon regeneration seen in mice that received chronic treatment of hM3Dq/CNO was 
greater than the amount seen in animals that received chronic treatment of the high
  
 
81 
contrast visual stimulation, suggesting that greater number of RGCs elevated their 
activity level in the animals that received hM3Dq/CNO treatment compared to the 
animals that received visual stimulation treatment. This difference likely stems from the 
specific type of visual stimulation that our study used - high contrast drifting gratings in 
fixed orientations - to which all RGCs respond but only certain group of direction-
selective RGCs respond most strongly to this stimulus (Dhande et al., 2015). Future 
studies must address how different RGC types respond to different types of visual 
stimulation that influences the amount of axon regeneration. This would further elucidate 
the molecular mechanism of the role of visual stimulation-driven neural activity in axon 
regeneration. 
The distance of axon regeneration was greatest in mice that received combined 
treatments that included elevation of RGC activity and unilateral lid suture (or eye 
removal) to eliminate vision through the non-lesioned eye pathway. This was surprising 
because complete optic nerve lesions would eliminate any potential binocular interactions 
among RGC axons within the central visual targets. Thus, the enhanced axon 
regeneration of unilateral visual bias may arise from several other sources. One 
possibility is that the bias effect observed here is purely behavioral - suturing shut the 
non-lesioned eye encouraged animals to keep the opposite, lesioned eye open, which 
would promote additional spiking activity in the RGCs from the lesioned eye. The shift in 
activity in response to neural defects or injury is well studied in the animal models of the 
stroke and Parkinson’s disease, in which the animals rely more on less compromised 
motor systems while relying less on the damaged motor systems (Schallert et al., 2000; 
Whishaw, 2000). Different groups have observed enhanced growth of neuronal processes 
  
 
82 
during motor training including force use of the impaired limb from the damaged motor 
systems (Jones and Schallert, 1994; Kleim et al., 1996; Schallert et al., 1997; 
Kempermann et al., 1998; Coq and Xerri, 1999; Maier et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2013). In 
our study, the reduced amount of axon regeneration observed in animals where AAV2-
cRheb1 and visual stimulation were provided through both eyes, compared to the long-
distance axon regeneration observed in the animals that received combined treatments of 
AAV2-cRheb1 and biased visual stimulation through the lesioned eye, further support the 
critical role of biased visual activity in RGC axon regeneration.  
 
Enhanced distance of RGC axon regeneration in multiple treatments  
 
I discovered that the CNS neurons regenerate their axons long distances, if they 
are treated with the appropriate growth-stimulating conditions. I found that enhanced 
RGC activity coupled with elevated mTOR signaling promoted axons to anatomically 
restore damaged visual circuitry. This suggests that activating intrinsic factors such as 
mTOR signaling and neural activity alone may be sufficient to overcome extrinsic 
barriers such as myelin-associated inhibitors and glial scars.  
 
Interestingly, PTEN deletion alone could trigger an even greater number of RGC 
axons to regenerate at proximal distances than the combined treatment paradigm that I 
implemented in our study. One possibility for the greater number of regenerating axons is 
that PTEN deletion occurs farther upstream of the mTOR activation and thus likely 
disinhibit other cell growth signaling pathways. However, while PTEN deletion causes 
RGC axons to grow as far as the optic chiasm, it does not allow them to grow into the 
  
 
83 
brain (Park et al., 2008) unless it is combined with one or more other treatments (de Lima 
et al., 2012).  
 
Together, these data illustrate the complex molecular mechanisms CNS neurons 
implement during development and further illustrate the fact that multiple treatments 
applied in combination are required to trigger long-distance axon regeneration of CNS 
neurons, and they encourage additional exploration of the molecular pathways activated 
downstream of PTEN and neural activity. 
 
Specificity of mature RGC axon regeneration 
Axon regeneration of RGC subtypes 
From studying the pattern of axon regeneration of two genetically labeled RGC 
types, the α-RGCs and ipRGCs, I found that RGCs have the remarkable capacity to 
reconnect to their correct targets in the brain while simultaneously avoiding incorrect 
targets. The CoCH-GFP+ RGCs, subset of which label classic α-RGCs, are among the 
group of RGCs that regenerated, consistent with the previous work that identified α-
RGCs as the main group of RGCs undergoing axon regeneration after sciatic nerve 
transplants in cats (Watanabe et al., 1993). These results are also in agreement with a 
recent study showing that Kcng4-YFP+ α-RGCs account for the majority of regenerating 
axons following either PTEN deletion or combined treatments of osteopontin (OPN) 
overexpression with insulin growth factor (IGF) administration (Duan et al., 2015). 
Nearly all α-RGCs expressed elevated basal mTOR and OPN activity levels - conditions 
that were necessary for axon regeneration of this subset of RGCs. It remains to be further 
investigated why PTEN deletion that activates mTOR signaling in other RGC subtypes is 
  
 
84 
insufficient to trigger other RGC subtypes to regenerate. Our study illustrated that other 
RGC subtypes that are not α-RGCs (i.e. ipRGCs) could regenerate in response to our 
treatment paradigm. In the future, it will be important to identity other RGC subtypes that 
can regenerate. 
 
Target-specific re-innervation of CNS neurons 
It is remarkable that adult mammalian CNS neurons are capable of re-innervating 
the correct brain targets, yet it is not entirely surprising since other groups have reported 
target-specific re-innervation in multiple systems including in the visual system (Vidal-
Sanz et al., 1987; Wizenmann and Bahr, 1998; Suave et al., 2001; de Lima et al., 2012) 
and spinal cord (Brushart et al., 2005; Harvey et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2012). In 
addition, neutralizing the inhibitory effects of oligodendrocytes and myelin triggered 
striatal and cortical projection neurons to regenerate their axons long distances and to re-
innervate several of their correct targets in the substantia nigra, pontine nuclei and 
cervical spinal cord in adult rats (Wictorin et al., 1990). Ligands and receptors that are 
expressed in the presynaptic neurons and postsynaptic targets respectively ensure axons 
arrive at and innervate their proper targets during development in mammals (Sun et al., 
2015; Osterhout et al., 2015). The studies demonstrating target specificity of regenerating 
axons suggest that those cues may still be present, or even upregulated, in response to 
either nerve injury or regeneration-stimulating treatment. Indeed, Beazley and coworkers 
observed enhanced expression of ephrin-A2 in the contralateral side of the superior 
colliculus in an increasing rostro-caudal gradient one month after unilateral optic nerve 
transection, suggesting that the injury alone can change the expression of guidance 
  
 
85 
molecules (Roger et al., 2001). Similarly, such upregulation of guidance molecules in 
response to injury has been reported in the tectum of cold-blooded vertebrates (Roger et 
al., 2000; King et al., 2003). It will be important to address this hypothesis by exploring 
the molecular pathways that are activated in the RGC types that regenerate in our 
combined treatment protocol.  
 
Functional and clinical implications 
Restoration of subset of visual behaviors 
The ultimate goal of axon regeneration is to restore function in a damaged 
nervous system for restoration of appropriate behaviors. The combined treatment 
paradigm reported here partially restored visual function in a subset of visual assays. The 
behaviors in which I observed partial recovery were optokinetic reflex (driven by the 
accessory optic system) (Sun et al., 2015; Osterhout et al., 2015) and the looming 
avoidance response (driven by the retino-SC connections) (Zhao et al., 2014), while the 
assays where I failed to observe any significant recovery were the pupil response (driven 
by the retino-OPN connection) (Guler et al., 2008) and visual cliff test (driven by dLGN-
primary visual cortex (V1) connection) (Leamy et al., 2007). The first three behaviors 
require retino-subcortical pathways but not the cortex (Dhande et al., 2015) whereas the 
visual-cliff depth perception task depends on binocular vision and thus involves the 
dLGN and V1 (Leamy et al., 2007). Since I observed regeneration of RGC axons to the 
dLGN - the nucleus that relays visual information to the V1, the lack of recovery in the 
visual cliff task was surprising. It is possible that the threshold for functional behavioral 
output of the retino-geniculo-cortical pathway may be higher than that of the other 
  
 
86 
retinofugal parallel pathways at the level of synapse formation and/or precision of within-
target wiring. For partially restored optokinetic reflex and looming avoidance response, 
retinotopic and spatial precision of connections may not be required for pathways that 
drive OKR or looming since they involve large-field illumination (Cahill and Nathans, 
2008; Yimaz and Meister, 2013). On the contrary, visual cliff tasks require analysis of 
spatial frequency and thus higher resolution image-formation (Hovda et al., 1989). I 
observed regeneration of RGC axons to the OPN, the nucleus that regulates the PLR, but 
failed to observe any substantial recovery of pupil constriction. Notably, I intentionally 
used low light intensities to stimulate the PLR so as not to allow spillover of light to the 
opposite, non-lesioned eye. Although the use of low light was critical to avoid potential 
confounds, it is possible that higher light intensities could have driven functional 
activation of the PLR through the regenerated pathway connections.  
My behavioral data support a model in which restoration of neural pathways for 
visual function and perception may require a greater number of RGC axons to regenerate. 
He and coworkers probed the functional recovery of retino-collicular connections after 
distal nerve transection and found that target re-innervation occurred without restoration 
of functional behavior. The group could restore visual acuity by adding conduction in 
regenerated RGC axons via administration of voltage-gated potassium channel blockers, 
4-AP (Bei et al., 2016). In other models of ophthalmic disease such as retinal dystrophy 
and retinitis pigmentosa, electrical stimulation has been shown to prolong both RGC 
survival and function (Fu et al., 2015). Thus, additional sources of enhancing neural 
activity, in particular within the RGC populations that target the dLGN and SC, may be 
  
 
87 
critical for enhancing regeneration of mature central visual pathways and visual 
perception.  
In conclusion, during my thesis research, I discovered novel strategy to promote 
long-distance axon regeneration, specificity of re-connections, and partial restoration of 
visual function, which may be informative for developing treatment plans for patients 
suffering from the damaged visual system, spinal cord or other CNS regions as a result of 
physical trauma or neurodegenerative disease.
