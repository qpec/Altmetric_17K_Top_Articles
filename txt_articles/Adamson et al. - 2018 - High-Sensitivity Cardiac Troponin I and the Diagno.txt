BACKGROUND: We determined whether high-sensitivity cardiac troponin 
I can improve the estimation of the pretest probability for obstructive 
coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with suspected stable angina.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In a prespecified substudy of the SCOT-
HEART trial (Scottish Computed Tomography of the Heart), plasma cardiac 
troponin was measured using a high-sensitivity single-molecule counting 
assay in 943 adults with suspected stable angina who had undergone 
coronary computed tomographic angiography. Rates of obstructive CAD 
were compared with the pretest probability determined by the CAD 
Consortium risk model with and without cardiac troponin concentrations. 
External validation was undertaken in an independent study population 
from Denmark comprising 487 patients with suspected stable angina. 
Higher cardiac troponin concentrations were associated with obstructive 
CAD with a 5-fold increase across quintiles (9%–48%; P<0.001) 
independent of known cardiovascular risk factors (odds ratio, 1.35; 
95% confidence interval, 1.25–1.46 per doubling of troponin). Cardiac 
troponin concentrations improved the discrimination and calibration of 
the CAD Consortium model for identifying obstructive CAD (C statistic, 
0.788–0.800; P=0.004; χ2=16.8 [P=0.032] to 14.3 [P=0.074]). The 
updated model also improved classification of the American College of 
Cardiology/American Heart Association pretest probability risk categories 
(net reclassification improvement, 0.062; 95% confidence interval, 0.035–
0.089). The revised model achieved similar improvements in discrimination 
and calibration when applied in the external validation cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentration is an 
independent predictor of obstructive CAD in patients with suspected 
stable angina. Use of this test may improve the selection of patients for 
further investigation and treatment.

P
resentations with suspected stable angina are 
common, yet determining an accurate diagnosis 
is frequently challenging. Patients and clinicians 
alike are understandably keen to identify the cause of 
the symptoms in order that these can be treated and 
hopefully ameliorated. Of equal importance is the 
concern that these symptoms may reflect prognosti-
cally significant atherosclerotic disease with the asso-
ciated risk of future cardiovascular events. These con-
cerns are appropriate given that 1 in 6 patients will 
experience coronary death or nonfatal acute coronary 
syndrome in the 3 years after a diagnosis of stable an-
gina.1 Importantly, this risk remains substantial even 
in those patients with symptoms deemed noncardiac 
in origin.1 Consequently, despite the central role of 
the clinical history and cardiovascular risk factor as-
certainment in the assessment process, supplemen-
tary investigations are frequently required to provide 
additional certainty related to the presence or ab-
sence of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD).2 
Several national and international bodies have pro-
posed standardized pathways that use risk models to 
estimate the pretest probability (PTP) of obstructive 
CAD and guide decision making with regards to ap-
propriate use of investigations.3–5 However, there is 
evidence both that these models may overestimate 
risk6–8 and that clinician use of stratification tools re-
mains suboptimal.9,10
In light of these challenges, there is widespread 
interest in identifying suitable biomarkers that may 
improve diagnostic accuracy in patients with sus-
pected stable CAD. As yet, no novel circulating bio-
marker has been shown to improve diagnostic clas-
sification.3 It is in this context that a role may emerge 
for the most recent generation of high-sensitivity 
cardiac troponin assays. These tests offer the ability 
to reliably measure troponin in the majority of the 
healthy population and have already had a significant 
impact on the assessment of suspected acute coro-
nary syndromes.11 Meanwhile, evidence is emerging 
of potential roles in the context of stable cardiovas-
cular diseases.12,13
This study aimed to determine whether routine 
quantification of plasma high-sensitivity cardiac tropo-
nin I (hs-cTnI) concentrations could improve estimation 
of the PTP of obstructive CAD in patients with suspect-
ed stable angina.

Study Design
The SCOT-HEART trial (Scottish Computed Tomography of the 
Heart) was a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled 
study that investigated the role of coronary computed tomo-
graphic angiography (CCTA) in patients referred to a specialist 
clinic with suspected angina because of coronary heart dis-
ease. The study design14 and principal findings15 have previ-
ously been reported. Briefly, participants were recruited from 
12 cardiology chest pain clinics across Scotland, and those 
randomized to the intervention arm underwent CCTA imag-
ing at 1 of 3 sites in addition to routine clinical assessment. 
There was a prespecified biomarker substudy that obtained 
blood samples from those participants where the CCTA 
was performed at the Clinical Research Imaging Center in 
Edinburgh, United Kingdom. Recruitment began in November 
18, 2010, and follow-up of clinical outcomes continued until 
June 30, 2016. The study was performed in accordance with 
the Declaration of Helsinki and with research ethics commit-
tee approval. Written informed consent was obtained from all 
individuals before study participation.
hs-cTnI Measurement
Venous blood samples for biomarker testing were obtained 
immediately before CCTA imaging. Blood was processed 
and stored at −80°C until analyzed. Plasma hs-cTnI concen-
trations were measured using a high-sensitivity single-mol-
ecule counting assay on the Erenna platform (Singulex, Inc, 
Alameda, CA), which has a limit of detection of 0.1 ng/L, a 
limit of quantification (coefficient of variation, <10%) of 0.4 
ng/L, and a 99th centile upper reference limit of 10.9 ng/L.16,17 
To facilitate internal validation of this measurement with a 
clinically available assay, a secondary analysis was performed 
wherein the samples were analyzed using the ARCHITECTSTAT 
high-sensitive troponin I assay (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott 
Park, IL), which has a limit of detection of 1.2 ng/L and coef-
ficient of variation <10% at 3.0 ng/L and sex-specific 99th 
centile upper reference limits of 16 and 34 ng/L in women 
and men, respectively.17,18
WHAT IS KNOWN
• Most patients presenting with suspected stable 
angina do not ultimately have obstructive coro-
nary artery disease identified as a cause for their 
symptoms.
• Despite this, current guideline-endorsed, risk-
based approaches to the assessment of these 
patients result in the majority having to undergo 
noninvasive cardiac imaging tests to exclude this 
diagnosis.
WHAT THE STUDY ADDS
• Measuring high-sensitivity cardiac troponin con-
centrations in patients with suspected stable 
angina can safely increase the proportion of 
patients determined to be at low risk of coronary 
disease and, therefore, reduce the need for more 
costly imaging investigations.

Coronary Computed Tomographic 
Angiography
Participants underwent coronary artery calcium scoring and 
CCTA using a 320-detector scanner (Aquilion One; Toshiba 
Medical Systems, Nasushiobara, Japan). Computed tomo-
graphic (CT) images were analyzed by 2 trained observers 
with excellent reproducibility.19 Differences in categorization 
were resolved by consensus. Coronary artery calcium scor-
ing was performed using dedicated software (VScore; Vital 
Images, Minnetonka, MN). Agatston score was calculated 
using a threshold of 130 HU for each vessel and summed to 
give a total score. The coronary arteries were assessed using 
a 15-segment model with each segment classified into 1 of 5 
categories dependent on the degree of luminal cross-sectional 
area stenosis: normal (<10% stenosis), mild nonobstructive 
(10%–49% stenosis), moderate nonobstructive (50%–69% 
stenosis), obstructive (70%–99% stenosis), or total/subtotal 
occlusion (100% stenosis). For the purposes of the primary 
outcome, obstructive CAD was defined before this analysis 
within the published SCOT-HEART trial protocol, as a lumi-
nal cross-sectional area stenosis of ≥70% (approximating to 
a 50% diameter stenosis) in at least 1 major epicardial vessel 
or ≥50% in the left main stem.14 Using previously described 
methods,20 the segment stenosis score was quantified as a 
measure of overall atherosclerotic burden. All image analyses 
were performed blinded to the biomarker results.
CAD Consortium Model
The CAD Consortium (CADC) is part of the European Network 
for the Assessment of Imaging in Medicine. In 2011 and 
2012, the CADC updated and extended the earlier Diamond–
Forrester model to estimate more accurately the PTP of 
obstructive CAD identified on invasive coronary angiography 
in patients with suspected stable angina.8,21 The CADC model 
incorporates age, sex, and chest pain characteristics and 
underpins the risk tables included in the current European 
Society of Cardiology guideline on the management of stable 
CAD.3 Furthermore, it has recently been shown to provide 
more accurate estimates of the probability of obstructive 
CAD than the modified Diamond–Forrester model currently 
endorsed by the American College of Cardiology/American 
Heart Association guidelines and appropriate use criteria 
for the diagnosis of stable CAD.22–24 The American College 
of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline uses 2 
thresholds to stratify patients into 3 risk groups. Patients with 
a PTP <10% are deemed low-risk, those with a PTP between 
10% and 90% are classed as intermediate risk, whereas those 
with a PTP ≥90% are high risk for CAD. It is widely recognized 
that the diagnostic use of noninvasive testing is the greatest 
in patients with intermediate PTP of obstructive coronary dis-
ease, and the benefits of further testing are limited in low-risk 
individuals. High-risk patients may warrant invasive coronary 
angiography for the purposes of prognostic stratification or to 
facilitate therapeutic revascularization.
Validation Cohort
External validation of the revised model was performed 
in a previously described study population25,26 comprising 
487 patients with suspected stable angina who underwent 
biomarker sampling in addition to coronary imaging (CCTA in 
336 invasive angiographies in 151) at the Odense University 
Hospital, Denmark. Troponin concentrations were determined 
using the Abbott Architect assay.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using R version 3.3.0 (R 
Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). 
Summary statistics for patient characteristics were estimated, 
by quintile of cardiac troponin concentration, with χ2 and 
ANOVA tests being used to compare categorical and con-
tinuous variables, respectively. In logistic regression models, 
the probability of each patient having obstructive CAD was 
estimated. Cardiac troponin concentration and coronary 
artery calcium scores were log-transformed as linearizing 
transformations. Associations were estimated unadjusted 
and after adjusting for age, sex, chest pain characteristics, 
cardiovascular risk factors, and noninvasive test results. The 
baseline CADC model and CADC model with the addition of 
cardiac troponin were also fitted. In both cases, the model 
intercept was estimated from the sample data (with the 
coefficients for age, sex, and chest pain typicality fixed) to 
allow fair comparison of model performance. Discrimination 
and calibration were compared for the current CADC model 
and the CADC model with troponin, using the Delong 
method27 and the Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test 
(P value <0.05 defined as poor calibration), respectively. 
The coefficient of discrimination (D) was calculated accord-
ing to the method proposed by Tjur.28 The categorical net 
reclassification improvement index was estimated using the 
American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association-
recommended PTP threshold of 10% to distinguish low risk 
from intermediate or high risk. The association between 
troponin assays was assessed using the Pearson correlation 
coefficient.
The performance, in terms of discrimination and calibra-
tion, of the new model incorporating troponin concentra-
tion was also compared with the existing CADC model in an 
independent cohort. Neither the intercept nor the coefficients 
were reestimated for either model.
RESULTS
Data Collection and Study Population
The study population of the SCOT-HEART trial has pre-
viously been described.15 Between November 18, 2010, 
and September 24, 2014, 4146 participants were 
recruited of whom 2073 were randomly assigned to 
standard care plus CCTA, and 1778 of these underwent 
CCTA at 1 of 3 sites. Blood samples were obtained from 
987 participants at the time of CCTA imaging at a single 
center, and 943 had plasma cardiac troponin I concen-
trations measured. CCTA image quality was nondiag-
nostic in 6 cases resulting in an analysis set comprising 
937 participants (Figure I in the Data Supplement). The 
baseline characteristics were similar between trial par-
ticipants with and without estimations of troponin con-
centrations (Table I in the Data Supplement).

Coronary CT Angiography
The median interval between randomization and CCTA 
was 13 days (interquartile range [IQR], 7–18 days). The 
median coronary artery calcium score was 31 (IQR, 
0–281) AU. CCTA demonstrated normal coronary arter-
ies in 322 (34%), mild-to-moderate nonobstructive 
disease in 348 (37%), and obstructive disease in 267 
(28%) participants.
hs-cTnI Concentrations
Using the Singulex assay, cardiac troponin I concentra-
tions were above the limit of detection in 934 of 937 
(99.6%) patients. The 3 samples with concentrations 
below this limit were assigned a value of 0.1 ng/L. The 
median concentration of hs-cTnI in all patients was 
1.41 (IQR, 0.89–2.28) ng/L with 907 (96.8%) and 27 
(2.9%) of patients above the limit of quantification 
(0.4 ng/L) and 99th centile upper reference limit (10.9 
ng/L), respectively. The median concentration of hs-cTnI 
in patients with obstructive coronary disease was 1.9 
(IQR, 1.3–3.1) ng/L, whereas the median concentration 
of hs-cTnI in those without coronary obstruction was 
1.2 (IQR, 0.8–1.9) ng/L, P<0.001.
Higher cardiac troponin quintiles were associated 
with increasing age, male sex, and several cardiovas-
cular risk factors (Table 1). The majority (82.3%) of 
patients underwent exercise electrocardiography, and 
this test was more likely to demonstrate inducible isch-
emia in those with higher cardiac troponin concentra-
tions (Table 2).
Higher cardiac troponin quintiles were associated 
with greater coronary atherosclerotic burden as deter-
mined by coronary artery calcium score or segment 
stenosis score. They were also more likely to have 
obstructive coronary disease with a 5-fold increase 
between the first and fifth quintiles (9.3%–47.5%; 
Table 2). Each 2-fold increment in troponin concen-
tration was associated with a 1.71-fold increment 
(95% confidence intervals [CIs], 1.60–1.83) in the 
odds of identifying obstructive CAD on CCTA. This 
association was moderately attenuated after adjust-
ing for age and sex (odds ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.29–
1.49) but persisted on further adjustment for chest 
pain description, cardiovascular risk factors, exercise 
ECG findings, and the coronary calcium score (odds 
ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.17–1.39; Table II in the Data 
Supplement).
Troponin testing with a second high-sensitivity cardi-
ac troponin I assay (Abbott Diagnostics) was performed 
on 931 samples and demonstrated good agreement 
with the Singulex assay (r=0.88). The median troponin 
concentration was 2.1 ng/L (95% CI, 1.3–3.5 ng/L), 
and several samples reported results below the limit of 
detection (200; 21.5%). Despite this, the overall find-
ings were consistent with the primary analysis (Tables IV 
through VIII in the Data Supplement; Figures II and III in 
the Data Supplement).

Update and Extension of the CADC 
Model
Compared with the cohort used to develop the CADC 
model, participants in our cohort were of similar age 
and more likely to have typical angina or obstruc-
tive disease on coronary imaging (Table III in the Data 
Supplement). Goodness-of-fit for the baseline CADC 
model was inadequate (χ2=20.2; Hosmer–Lemeshow 
P=0.0095), although improved after reestimation of the 
model intercept (difference in deviance, 7.1; 1 degree 
of freedom; P=0.0076). Adding cardiac troponin con-
centrations further improved model fit (difference in 
deviance, 16.3; 1 degree of freedom; P<0.0001).
The addition of cardiac troponin concentration 
improved overall model performance (D=0.230–0.257; 
Table 3), including discrimination (C statistic, 0.788–
0.800; P=0.0039; Figure IV in the Data Supplement). 
The addition of cardiac troponin concentration also 
improved classification of patients into American Col-
lege of Cardiology/American Heart Association risk 
categories (Table 4; Figure 1). There was a net 10.5% 
(95% CI, 7.7–13.8) reduction in the number of patients 
determined to be at intermediate or high risk according 
to the CADC model but without obstructive coronary 
disease on CCTA. One additional patient was inappro-
priately reclassified as low risk who had been deter-
mined to have intermediate PTP of CAD on the original 
CADC model (net reclassification index, 0.062; 95% CI, 
0.035–0.089).
External Validation
The validation cohort has been described previously,25,26 
and a summary of baseline characteristics is provided 
in Table VIII in the Data Supplement. The overall preva-
lence of obstructive coronary disease was 19.3%, and 
again, a 5-fold increase was seen across troponin quin-
tiles. The addition of cardiac troponin concentration 
improved overall model performance (D=0.071–0.121), 
including discrimination (C statistic, 0.738–0.757;

DISCUSSION
In the assessment of suspected stable angina, measure-
ment of hs-cTnI improves the accuracy of the PTP of 
obstructive CAD as estimated using the existing guide-
line-endorsed CAD Consortium risk model. Applied 
in this manner, high-sensitivity troponin testing can 
appropriately reclassify 1 in 10 intermediate- or high-
risk patients without obstructive disease into a low-risk 
category. Consequently, this simple investigation has 
potential to improve the appropriate use of diagnos-
tic stress imaging tests by reducing unnecessary testing 
in 10.5% of those without disease. Alternatively, if the 
test was applied to all individuals with suspected CAD, 
21 troponin tests would be required to avoid 1 unnec-
essary CCTA. Reassuringly, this reduction in unneces-
sary imaging is achieved without any decrease in the 
negative predictive value of the model, thereby con-
firming the safety of our new diagnostic approach. We 
have developed a risk estimation tool that incorporates 
cardiac troponin I concentrations to allow clinicians to 
improve their estimation of PTP for coronary disease 
(https://scotheart.highsteacs.com/)
Our study has several notable strengths. First, we 
chose to use a troponin assay with exceptional analytic 
characteristics,17 including a diagnostic sensitivity that 
outperforms other available platforms and that was 
able to detect cardiac troponin concentrations in 99.6% 
of our population, and to accurately quantify cardiac 
troponin concentrations in 96.8% of patients. Second, 
because this study was nested within a larger random-
ized trial of CCTA imaging in patients with suspected 
angina, we were able to minimize the potential for case 
ascertainment bias that can arise when the decision to 
proceed to coronary imaging is dependent on clinician 
perception of coronary disease risk. Third, we made use 
of state-of-the-art CT imaging using a 320-slice scan-
ner to define the presence and extent of CAD in all 
patients. Fourth, the prospective nature of this study 
enabled detailed and accurate phenotypic characteriza-
tion of patients at baseline and comprehensive clinical 
follow-up. Finally, we demonstrated the external valid-
ity of the derived model in an international and inde-
pendent cohort.
Current guidelines recommend a routine full blood 
count and measurement of renal function to identify 
drivers of myocardial ischemia and improve risk predic-
tion. They also encourage analysis of lipid profiles and 
glycemic indices because these represent important 
cardiovascular risk factors. Although acknowledging 
that elevations in troponin have some prognostic val-
ue in stable patients, the consensus opinion in 20133 
was that there was insufficient independent prognos-
tic value to warrant routine measurement. This view-
point is now being challenged by a growing body of 
evidence that demonstrates cardiac troponin to have 
independent prognostic value on several cardiovascular 
disorders, including heart failure and myocardial infarc-
tion, and may even be a useful indicator of therapeutic 
response.12,29–31
Overall, our findings expand on this research dem-
onstrating that troponin concentrations predict the 
presence of obstructive CAD in patients with suspected 
stable angina. The mechanisms behind this association, 
including ventricular strain32 and myocardial ischemia,33 
are now emerging. Additionally, it seems apparent 
from our study that atherosclerotic burden plays an 
important role. Whether these low concentrations of 
troponin reflect subclinical myocardial necrosis related 
to coronary plaque disruption and microvascular dis-
ease or increased myocardial cell turnover remains to 
be determined. To our knowledge, this is the first time 
a single, nongenetic34 circulating biomarker has been 
shown to provide improved discrimination for the diag-
nosis of stable obstructive CAD beyond established risk 
factors. Importantly, this improvement results in suc-
cessful reclassification of patients into more appropriate 
diagnostic probability groups, which could enable more 
rational use of subsequent investigations.
The high-sensitivity assay used in this study has par-
ticularly robust analytic characteristics but is presently 
available for research use only. We were able to mea-
sure troponin concentrations in >99% of the popula-
tion across both sexes and a wide range of ages. Our

internal validation demonstrated consistent results 
when using a commercially available test, but it is 
important to note the risk calculation will be assay spe-
cific. Whether our findings can be extrapolated to alter-
native clinical assays is unclear, but it would be prudent 
for manufacturers to validate each testing platform 
individually before considering use in this setting where 
troponin concentrations are approaching the limits of 
detection. Furthermore, we cannot be certain of how 
knowledge of troponin concentration may influence 
clinical management decisions because treating clini-
cians did not have access to the biomarker results dur-
ing the conduct of the trial.
We made use of the latest generation of CT scan-
ners developed with a focus on advancing the perfor-
mance of CCTA. Although some authors may suggest 
that invasive coronary angiography remains the refer-
ence standard, it seems unlikely that troponin would 
be related to CT-defined CAD independent of the pres-
ence and extent of true CAD. As such, any misclassi-
fication is likely to be nondifferential with respect to 
troponin, and hence to cause us to underestimate the 
association between troponin and stable CAD, and the 
predictive performance of the model. Moreover, the 
chosen criteria for defining significant coronary disease 
on CCTA has previously been shown to correlate well 
with invasive angiographic findings and with noninva-
sively determined myocardial ischemia.35 Indeed, in the 
SCOT-HEART trial, CCTA was associated with a >60% 
reduction in the rate of normal coronary angiography 
and a 30% increase in obstructive disease when down-
stream invasive coronary angiography was performed.36 
We also contend that a particular strength of this study 
arises from it being nested within a larger trial, which 
randomized patients to coronary imaging, thereby min-
imizing the case ascertainment bias inherent in earlier 
trials that only included patients referred for invasive 
coronary angiography. This applicability to the general

population is reflected in the relatively lower rates of 
obstructive disease identified compared with previous 
reports.
We added a single additional continuous variable to 
an existing model. As such, the improvement in model 
performance by adding cardiac troponin is unlikely to 
have been substantially inflated by overfitting. Con-
firmation of this is demonstrated by our findings on 
applying the model to the external validation cohort. 
Indeed, it appears increasingly likely, given the potential 
prognostic and diagnostic information cardiac troponin 
offers, that indications for testing outside the acute 
coronary syndrome setting now exist.
CONCLUSIONS
Plasma hs-cTnI concentrations independently pre-
dict the presence of obstructive coronary disease in 
patients with suspected stable angina. Using this test 
within the chest pain clinic may improve the selection 
of patients for further investigation and treatment of 
CAD.
