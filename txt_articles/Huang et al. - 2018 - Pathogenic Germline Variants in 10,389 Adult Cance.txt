SUMMARY
We conducted the largest investigation of predispo-
sition variants in cancer to date, discovering 853
pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 8% of
10,389 cases from 33 cancer types. Twenty-one
genes showed single or cross-cancer associations,
including novel associations of SDHA in melanoma
and PALB2 in stomach adenocarcinoma. The 659
predisposition variants and 18 additional large dele-
tions in tumor suppressors, including ATM, BRCA1,
and NF1, showed low gene expression and frequent
(43%) loss of heterozygosity or biallelic two-hit
events. We also discovered 33 such variants in
oncogenes, including missenses in MET, RET, and
PTPN11 associated with high gene expression. We
nominated 47 additional predisposition variants
from prioritized VUSs supported by multiple evi-
dences involving case-control frequency, loss of het-
erozygosity, expression effect, and co-localization
with mutations and modified residues. Our integra-
tive approach links rare predisposition variants to
functional consequences, informing future guide-
lines of variant classification and germline genetic
testing in cancer.
INTRODUCTION
A sizable fraction of cancer is heritable (Lichtenstein et al., 2000),
but known common variants explain only a limited percentage of
the genetic burden in cancer (Bodmer and Tomlinson, 2010).
More than 100 genes, mostly tumor suppressors, have been

 found to harbor rare, predisposing alleles (Rahman, 2014). Most
reports on germline variants have focused on single cancer
types, although mounting evidence has suggested shared pre-
disposition factors across cancer types. Previous pan-cancer
studies have highlighted pathogenic germline variants in tumor
suppressor genes, including ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1,
and PALB2 in adult cancers in The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) (Lu et al., 2015) and the Collaborative Oncological
Gene-environment Study (COGS) (Southey et al., 2016), as well
as TP53, APC, BRCA2, NF1, PMS2, and RB1 using 1,120 pedi-
atric cancer cases from the Pediatric Cancer Genome Project
(PCGP) (Zhang et al., 2015). As sequencing projects expand,
large-scale, systematic analyses are needed to increase statisti-
cal power and to compare predisposition factors among gene
categories and cancer types.
Clinical interpretation of germline variants is a pressing chal-
lenge. Conflicting claims resulting from variability in sequencing
technologies, analysis pipelines, and interpretations hinder the
application of such knowledge (Amendola et al., 2016). Recent
American
College
of
Medical
Genetics
and
Genomics–
Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG-AMP) guidelines
provide a systematic method for interpretation of sequence var-
iants for genetic disorders (Richards et al., 2015); however, a
high fraction of variants is relegated to the uncertain significance
(VUS) category, often due to rarity and conflicting results in exist-
ing databases and the primary literature. Systematic analyses of
high-throughput data associated with germline variants, such as
matching tumor sequencing and mRNA sequencing data, can
provide evidence of functional consequences and further inform
clinical interpretation. For example, allele fraction derived from
sequencing analysis of matched tumor and normal samples
can validate whether variants of tumor suppressors are undergo-
ing positive selection in the context of the classic two-hit model
(Knudson, 1971; Knudson, 2001; Lu et al., 2015), and mRNA
analysis can validate whether a germline truncation results in
reduced expression. Of note, the current ACMG-AMP guidelines
do not make use of this type of somatic analysis evidence for
evaluation of germline variants.
In this study, we analyzed the landscape of pathogenic vari-
ants from 10,389 individuals across 33 cancer types in the
TCGA cohort. We identified 8% of cases carrying pathogenic
or likely pathogenic germline variants, ranging in prevalence
from a striking 22.9% in PCPG to a scarce 2.2% in CHOL.
Notably, we identified 33 such variants within oncogenes. In
contrast to variants of tumor suppressor genes showing associ-
ation with low expression (47.6% in bottom 25% of the carrier
sample’s respective cancer cohort) and loss of heterozygosity
(LOH; 38.5%), variants in oncogenes are associated with high
expression (62% in top 25%). We further investigated the
functionality of these variants through validation in other cancer
cohorts and experiments on RET alleles. Finally, we discovered
another 18 copy number deletions and nominated 47 VUSs
based on multiple lines of evidences suggesting functionality.
Altogether, our study represents the largest systematic discov-
ery of rare, germline predisposition variants and provides a
firm basis for addressing their functionality in cancer.
RESULTS
Data Generation and Sharing on Cloud
The TCGA PanCanAtlas Germline Working Group analyzed
germline predisposing variants in 10,389 samples across 33
cancer types (Figure 1). A focus group conducted variant calling
on the Institute for Systems Biology Cancer Genomics Cloud
(ISB-CGC), and the resulting calls were shared among all inves-
tigators for quality control and downstream analyses (Figure 1A).
Specifically, we dockerized the GenomeVIP variant calling
system (https://github.com/ding-lab/GenomeVIP) (Mashl et al.,
2017) and deployed more than 121,000 virtual machines running
for over 600,000 hr on the ISB-CGC during the course of the proj-
ect. Variant calls from Genome Analysis Toolkit (McKenna et al.,
2010), VarScan2 (Koboldt et al., 2012), and Pindel (Ye et al.,
2009; Ye et al., 2015) were merged, filtered, and annotated
(STAR Methods), resulting in 286,657,499 total exonic variants,
ranging from an average of 33,037 exonic variants per individual
of African ancestry to 26,640 of European ancestry (Figure 1B).
Our data-sharing paradigm effectively facilitated the analyses
required by such an enormous project, avoiding both redundant
computation in variant calling and storage of intermediate anal-
ysis files in various local computational clusters.
The final set of 10,389 samples passed stringent quality
control criteria, showing good coverage, no outlying numbers
of variants called, and high concordance with single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNP) array data (STAR Methods). Across germ-
line-normal
samples,
quality
control
analysis
revealed
a
coverage of 18 �174X for the 152 cancer susceptibility genes
known to harbor rare, pathogenic variants (STAR Methods,
Table S1, and Figure S1). The passed variant calls achieved an
average precision above 0.99 when compared to the genotypes
obtained through SNP array data (Figure S1). The germline
exomes displayed high quality, with an average transition-trans-
version (TiTv) ratio of 2.88 ± 0.17 and lambda value (Koire et al.,
2016) of 0.034 ± 0.003. The median predicted percent false pos-
itive calls across 33 cancer types was less than 5%, ranging from
1.2% (MESO) to 16.1% (KIRC, Figure S1). These resources are
shared with the cancer researcher community on the cloud for
further evaluation across institutions worldwide.
Pathogenic Variant Discovery across 33 Cancer Types
We developed an automatic variant classification pipeline
called CharGer (Characterization of Germline Variants, https://
github.com/ding-lab/CharGer) by adopting and extending the

 ACMG-AMP guidelines (Richards et al., 2015) specifically for
rare variants in cancer. CharGer queries information from ClinVar
(Landrum et al., 2016), including variant entry submissions and
disease-gene associations reported. We also generated gene-
specific databases for known susceptibility genes, including
TP53, BRCA1, BRCA2, RET, and TERT (STAR Methods).
Further, in total, we curated 152 genes that contribute to cancer
susceptibility, adding 15 genes from the St. Jude PCGP germline
study (Zhang et al., 2015), 11 from Cancer Gene Census-Germ-
line, and 12 from recent literature (reference listed in Table S1) to
a published list of 114 known predisposition genes (Rahman,
2014) (Table S1). Overall, each variant is evaluated using data
available for any of 12 pathogenic evidence levels and 4 benign
evidence tags from ACMG-AMP that contribute to a composite
score used for automatic classification. After CharGer evalua-
tion, known pathogenic variants in ClinVar and curated data-
bases are marked as pathogenic, whereas variants with CharGer
score > 8 as likely pathogenic, and those with CharGer score > 4
as prioritized VUSs (STAR Methods, Figure S2, and Table S1).
We bench-marked this automated classification and demon-
strated its high performance: achieving a sensitivity of 88%
and a false-positive rate of 4.9% for detecting pathogenic vari-
ants out of 883 germline variants found in pediatric cancer
classified by the PCGP expert panel (Zhang et al., 2015).
We applied CharGer to classify variants found in our TCGA
cohort into pathogenic, likely pathogenic, and prioritized VUS
groups. CharGer initially prioritized 31,963 variants in these sam-
ples, 1,393 of which were labeled as rare variants (%0.05% AF in
1000 Genomes and complete ExAC r.3.0.1) relevant to cancer,
passing manual review in both normal and tumor samples
(STAR Methods). Combining existing database curation and
CharGer results, we classified these into 435 pathogenic vari-
ants, 418 likely pathogenic variants (Table S2), and 540
prioritized VUSs (Table S2 and Figure 1C). This catalog of 853
pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants expanded
significantly from our previous study, which had focused solely
on variants that truncate tumor suppressors in 12 TCGA cancer
types (Lu et al., 2015).
Across all cancer types, 4.1% of cases (n = 428) harbored
pathogenic variants, and another 3.8% (n = 390) carried likely
pathogenic variants (Figure 2A). The frequencies of pathogenic
or likely pathogenic variants vary greatly across cancer types
(Table S3), with the expected high rates in OV (19.9%) and
BRCA (9.9%). Other cancer types that involve tissue types that
are exposed to environmental factors, such as SKCM (6.2%)
and UVM (5%), had lower percentages of carriers. Notably,
22.9% of PCPG (Fishbein and Nathanson, 2012), 14.1% of
PAAD (Solomon et al., 2012), and 12.5% of SARC (Ballinger
et al., 2016) cases carried such variants, suggesting significant
contributions of rare germline predisposition in these cohorts.
We investigated genes with enriched pathogenic or likely
pathogenic variants in each cancer type. Briefly, we first identi-
fied cancer types with potential higher enrichment by comparing
to pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants identified in the
Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) non-TCGA cohort. We
then conducted total frequency testing (TFT) (Basu and Pan,
2011) for one cancer type against all other cancer types, sub-
tracting the ones with potential enrichment for each gene
(STAR Methods). We identified 28 specific cancer-gene associ-
ations (FDR < 0.05) and 16 additional suggestive (FDR < 0.15)
associations (Figure 2C and Table S3). The majority of these find-
ings from the burden test are known associations. For example,
pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants of BRCA1 and BRCA2
are highly enriched in OV and BRCA (FDR < 1.15E�05), as
expected, while BRCA2 also showed significant enrichment in
PAAD (FDR = 0.012). PCPG is associated with a wide array of
predisposition factors, including RET, SDHB, VHL, NF1, SDHD,
and MAX.
There were several new findings that may suggest unexpected
germline susceptibility gene and tumor associations (Table S3).
For example, five stomach adenocarcinoma patients carried
five different PALB2 loss-of-function (LOF) variants (FDR =
0.038, nonsense and frameshift) with variable LOH (2 of 5
tumors) similar to that seen in other PALB2-associated tumors.
Only one other recent report suggests this potential association
(Sahasrabudhe et al., 2017). Similarly, three melanoma patients
carried three different LOF variants in SDHA (FDR = 0.035, and
very low expression levels)—a gene that was not previously
associated with melanoma susceptibility. Strikingly, two LUSC
and three GBM patients carry the same rare BUB1B missense
variant, namely p.Q912H. A prior mouse model suggested that
haploinsufficiency for BUB1B increases the development of
carcinogen-induced lung carcinomas (Dai et al., 2004). Thus,
our results may have revealed novel cancer susceptibility asso-
ciations that require further study.
At the variant level, we identified 659 pathogenic or likely path-
ogenic variants in 66 tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) (Figure 2D).
We also discovered 33 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants
in five oncogenes: RET, AR, PTPN11, MET, and CBL. 21 RET
variants were found across 11 cancer types. Some appear to
be cancer specific; for example, all of the three pathogenic
MET p.H1112R variants are observed in KIRP (papillary renal
carcinoma), validating the previously observed co-segregation
of the variant in hereditary KIRP (Schmidt et al., 1998). For tumor
suppressors, we identified a total of 57 ATM variants, 36 BRIP1,
and 29 PALB2, all in at least 18 cancer types. In contrast, multiple
other tumor suppressor genes showed enrichment in specific
cancer types, such as BRCA1, BRCA2 variants in BRCA, and
OV (Figure 2C). For example, all four of the tumors containing
the pathogenic BRCA1 p.C61G variants in the ring domain are
breast-invasive carcinoma.
Two-Hit Events
To better understand the biological impacts of the discovered
variants, we examined the extent of LOH using a statistical test
we developed previously (Lu et al., 2015) (STAR Methods). We
discovered 157 significant (FDR < 5%) LOH of pathogenic or
likely pathogenic germline variants in tumors (Figure 3A), 148
of which were found in tumor suppressor genes. In contrast, sig-
nificant LOH is only observed in four variants of oncogenes,
possibly due to their gain-of-function nature and less selection
requirement for the activated mutated allele to be homozygous.
To validate the allele specificity of the discovered LOH events,
we further characterized both the normal and tumor read-count
data and tumor copy number variation (CNV) calls using GISTIC
(Table S4, STAR Methods). Variants showing suggestive LOH

Cell 173, 355–370, April 5, 2018
 (FDR < 0.15 or tumor VAF > 60%, STAR Methods) showed
similar extents of deletion to variants with significant LOH (Fig-
ure 3B). Thus, many of these are likely to be true events failing
to reach statistical significance due to insufficient sequencing
reads, adding up to 38.5% of variants (n = 254) in tumor suppres-
sors showing LOH. We further confirmed that 154 of these LOH
events in tumor suppressors are due to deletion of the wild-type
allele (Figure 3C).
As expected, strong LOH is observed in cancer types having
high hereditary predisposition. The four OV samples containing
BRCA1 p.Q1777fs, p.D825fs, p.W372*, and p.E797* each
showed highly significant LOH (FDR % 3.43E�20), whereas
BRCA2 p.E1857fs, p.E294*, and p.Y1762* also showed strong
LOH in the other three OV samples (FDR % 3.27E�11). We
further compared rates of LOH in BRCA1/2 across cancers,
finding that most BRCA1/2 variants exhibit LOH in OV and a
slightly lower fraction in BRCA and an even lower fraction but
notable 11 such events in other cancers (Figure S3). The
BRIP1 p.S624* variant showed pathogenic evidence from three
independent ClinVar submitters and displayed strong LOH evi-
dence (FDR = 1.31E�16) in an OV sample. RAD51C p.R193*
showed LOH in both BRCA and OV (FDR = 3.04E�12 and
5.79E�05, respectively), but not SKCM (FDR = 0.933). MET
p.H1112R, which was previously shown to cause malignant
transformation of NIH 3T3 cells (Schmidt et al., 1998), showed
LOH due to amplification of the variant allele in two of the three
KIRP samples (FDR = 2.24E�05, 6.98E�3, 0.26, respectively).
The positive selection of these germline variants in the tumor
further validates their clinical relevance.
Another manifestation of the two-hit hypothesis is a patho-
genic or likely pathogenic germline variant coupled with a so-
matic mutation in the other copy of the predisposition gene.
We identified 37 candidate biallelic events when analyzing the
tumors in our cohort (STAR Methods, Exact Poisson test,
p < 1E�5, Figure 3D and Table S4). Six germline variants of
ATM, including two p.T2333fs and one each of p.S2289fs,
p.R23*, p.E1267fs, and a start loss variant, were coupled with
somatic ATM mutations. Three cases carrying distinct BRCA2
germline truncations, including p.T1598fs, p.A2314fs, and
p.Q1037*, also harbored BRCA2 somatic mutations (Figure 3D).
A COAD case carried an MSH6 p.R248fs germline variant and a
p.R248* somatic mutation that are mutually exclusive in all
sequencing reads, clearly supporting the two-hit abruption of
both alleles (Figure S3).
Multiple tumor suppressor genes also showed expression
patterns consistent with the two-hit hypothesis—an African
American KIRP patient with onset at age 35 carried the patho-
genic FH p.S187* germline variant and a somatic splice site FH
mutation—and showed low FH expression (at 2.07% of KIRP).
A BLCA sample carried the CHEK2 germline p.W93* com-
pounded by four different CHEK2 somatic mutations subse-
quently showing low CHEK2 expression (at 1.7% of BLCA).
Overall, these results provide supporting evidence of the two-
hit hypothesis through LOH and biallelic events of predisposing
alleles across many tumor types.
Altered Gene Product Expression in Variant Carriers
In addition to expression associated with two-hit events, we
systematically investigated the gene and protein expression in
carriers of pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants of
the respective gene. Briefly, we calculated the percentile of
gene expression for variant carriers relative to other cases in
the same cancer cohort. We then conducted a differential
expression analysis to look for genes expressed at different
levels in variant carriers (STAR Methods). We identified 15
significant (FDR < 0.05, linear regression) and 6 suggestive
(FDR < 0.15) gene-cancer associations (Figures 4A, 4B, S4,
and Table S5).
In breast cancer, FANCM, ATM, BRCA2, CHEK2, and BRCA1
carriersallshowedsignificantlylowerexpressionoftherespective
gene (Figures 4A and 4B). In PCPG, RET carriers showed higher
RET expression, whereas SDHB, NF1, and SDHD carriers have
lower expression. In addition to breast cancer, ATM carriers ex-
hibited significantly lower expression in LUAD and LGG. We
then conducted the same analysis using RPPA data, investigating
whether the effects extend to the protein and phosphoprotein
levels (Figures 4C and 4D and Table S5). Notably, ATM carriers
were significantly associated with lower protein expression
in five cancer types, namely STAD, PAAD, PRAD, BRCA,
and LGG. CHEK2 carriers also showed lower protein expression
of the Chk2 marker in BRCA and suggestively in BLCA
(FDR = 0.053).
Overall, the associated gene expression showed distinct dis-
tributions for oncogenes versus tumor suppressors (Figure 4B).
Pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants in tumor sup-
pressors are associated with lower distributions in gene expres-
sion than those in oncogenes (two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test, p = 5.70E�7): 47.6% of such variants in tumor suppressors
were associated with the bottom quartile of gene expression. In
contrast, 62.1% of those in oncogenes were associated with the
top quartile, suggesting divergent transcriptional regulation of
tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes carrying pathogenic
or likely pathogenic variants.
On the variant level, all three tumors with the MET p.H1112R
variant were in the top 25% MET gene expression in KIRP.
Twelve cases carrying predisposing RET alleles showed high
RET expression in their respective cancer cohorts, including 9
PCGP cases and, notably, 3 RET carriers from other cancer
types not typically associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia
type 2, including p.I852M in LGG (96%), p.D631Y in KIRP (84%),
and p.R912P in READ (80%). The two breast cancer carriers of
PTPN11 variants p.N58S and p.T411M also showed high
expression (> 88%). The high expression of the variant-associ-
ated oncogenes in tumor, many without detected copy number
amplifications, suggests that cancer cells may preferentially
upregulate pathogenic alleles in these oncogenes.
Rare Germline Copy Number Alterations
We systematically scanned for rare, germline copy number varia-
tions (CNVs) in the same 10,389 samples using both SNP-array
data and exome hidden Markov model (XHMM) analysis on
whole-exome sequencing (WES) data as previously described
(Fromer and Purcell, 2014; Ruderfer et al., 2016) on whole-
exome-sequence data (STAR Methods). We identified 42,208
rare (AF < 0.6% considering 50% overlaps) CNVs using SNP-array
data and 53,726 using XHMM on the WES data (Figure 5A). 3,584
of overlapping CNVs in both datasets passed rare, frequency

 filters. On average, each case had 0.38 overlapping deletions
and 0.96 overlapping duplications; 44% of the CNVs affected a
single gene, while 56% impacted multiple genes (Figure 5B).
Given the large amount of discovered CNVs, we hypothesized
that the pathogenic CNVs likely reside in genes showing enrich-
ment in specific cancers. Using the 28 associated cancer-gene
pairs from this cohort (Table S3), we found 18 events (2 were
jointly identified using both WES and SNP array) that marked
copy number deletions of 11 tumor suppressor genes (Figures
5C and S5). We found 3 BRCA and 2 OV cases showing
BRCA1 deletions. Two KIRC cases carried VHL deletions, and
one each of BRCA and PRAD cases carried ATM deletions.
Other genes affected by deletions included FH, MSH6, NF1,
PALB2, and PTEN.

Independent Genomic Evidence Supporting
Pathogenicity
We then sought independent evidence to corroborate the path-
ogenicity of the 853 identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic
variants, including the following: (1) significant enrichment in
cancer versus non-cancer cases at a single variant level, (2)
co-localization of variants with pathogenic germline alleles found
in pediatric cancers or with recurrent somatic mutations, and (3)
co-localization with post-translational modification (PTM) sites.
To determine whether the pathogenic or likely pathogenic var-
iants are enriched in cancer cases, we conducted association
testing by comparing allele frequencies in TCGA cases versus
non-TCGA cases in the most-powered Non-Finnish European
cohort in the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC r.0.3.1)
data comprised of 33,370 individuals (Lek et al., 2016) (STAR

 Methods). We found 30 unique variants showing suggestive
associations (one-tailed Fisher’s exact test, p < 0.05, Figure 6A
and Table S6). The top four associated variants passing multi-
ple-testing threshold (FDR < 0.05) include ATM p.E1978*
(p = 3.50E�06), BRCA1 p.Q1777fs (p = 2.97E�05), POT1
p.R363* (p = 3.11E�05), and PALB2 p.R170fs (p = 5.20E�04).
The results also provided supporting evidence of pathogenicity
for oncogenic variants such as MET p.H1112R (p = 2.00E�03)
and MPL p.F126fs (p = 0.0161).
In our TCGA cohort, we observed 28 pathogenic or likely path-
ogenic variants previously discovered in 1,120 pediatric cancers
(Zhang et al., 2015) (Figure 6B), including stop-gained variants in
BRIP1, ERCC3, FANCC, MSH2, and WRN. Further, we observed
23 incidences of germline variants co-localizing with recurrent
(n R 3) somatic mutations found in the TCGA Multi-Center
Mutation Calling Multi-tumor Completion (MC3) cohort data (Fig-
ure 6B and Table S6). Considering unique variants, these include
8 missense variants in TP53, 4 NF1 truncations, and 2 RET
missenses. For example, the TP53 p.R248W is a highly recurrent
somatic mutation (n = 94) while being observed as a germline
variant in both pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma (Zhang et al.,
2015) and LGG. The MEN2 (multiple endocrine neoplasia
type 2)-associated allele RET p.M918T seen in PCPG and asso-
ciated with MEN2B disorder was also found as a recurrent
somatic mutation (n = 4). Overall, we observed significant over-
laps between both recurrent somatic mutations and PCGP vari-
ants and pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants we found in
TCGA (exact Poisson test, p < 2.2E�16 in both tests), implying
shared oncogenic processes in predisposition across pediatric
and adult cancers, as well as germline and somatic genomes.
To further evaluate whether this set of 853 pathogenic or likely
pathogenic variants discovered in TCGA can impact a broader
patient population, we examined the direct overlap with these
variants in an independent (primarily metastatic) tumor cohort
collected at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer
Center (MDACC), which consists of 3,026 patients in 19 tumor

 types. Targeted panel sequencing of 201 cancer-related genes,
covering 39 out of 99 genes with pathogenic variants, were previ-
ously sequenced from these patients based on an institutional
clearinghouse protocol for cancer patients (Chen et al., 2015).
We rediscovered 29 specific variants found in TCGA (0.96% car-
rier frequency) in the MDACC cohort from eight tumor types,
including breast, colorectal, melanoma, head and neck, and glio-
blastoma multiforme (Table S6). In comparison, we identified
0.58% carriers of these variants of the same genes in the 53,105
non-TCGA samples in the ExAC cohorts, validating the enrich-
ment of these variants in cancer (Fisher’s Exact Test, p = 0.015).
Variants in Post-Translational Modification (PTM) Sites
To investigate the potential functional impact of germline variants
on protein signaling, we mapped the 853 variants to 316,216
experimentally collected known post-translational modification
(PTM) sites from ActiveDriverDB (Krassowski et al., 2018),
PhosphoSitePlus (Hornbeck et al., 2015), and the UniProt Knowl-
edge Base (The UniProt Consortium, 2017) (STAR Methods).
Overall, we found that 65 amino acid substitutions (missenses)
directly overlap or sit adjacent to 34 unique PTMs (Table S6),
showing a significant enrichment to those variants observed in
the 1000 Genomes dataset (STAR Methods, permutation test,
p < 2x10�11). The top six genes with pathogenic PTM-associated
substitutions include VHL (n = 10), CHEK2 (n = 9), BUB1B (n = 9),
TP53 (n = 8), and RET (n = 6). This agrees with our earlier obser-
vation that PTM sites are depleted of substitutions in the general
human population, while the sites are enriched in disease muta-
tions (Reimand et al., 2015).
To illustrate putative mechanisms of germline variants on
signaling networks, we systematically mapped the PTM-associ-
ated substitutions to known site-specific enzyme-substrate
interactions (Hornbeck et al., 2015; Krassowski et al., 2018)
(STAR Methods, Figures 6C and S6). Over 60% (21/34) of unique
substitutions in 9/18 genes occur in known protein sites bound by
upstream kinases and other classes of enzymes. For example,
five substitutions in TP53 potentially affect binding sites of ki-
nases, such as Aurora kinase A (AURKA) and CHEK2 (checkpoint
kinase 2), and other signaling enzymes, such as MDM2 and
EP300, that are known to activate or inhibit TP53 in response to
cellular stimuli. Five VHL variants occur in binding sites of the
NEK1 kinase that promotes its degradation (Patil et al., 2013).
Similarly, CHEK2 p.S428F may affect the auto-phosphorylation
and activation of CHEK2 kinase (Gabant et al., 2008). RET
p.V804M and p.R921P potentially affect its auto-phosphorylation
sites that are required for RET kinase activity (Kawamoto et al.,
2004; Plaza-Menacho et al., 2016). BRCA1 p.R1699W signifi-
cantly weakens binding to the BACH1 peptide through disruption
of the BRCT repeats (Shiozaki et al., 2004). Collectively, these
results suggest that a subset of pathogenic germline cancer pre-
disposition variants may manifest their function by disrupting and
rewiring complex protein signaling networks.
Functional Assessment of Germline RET Alleles
We adapted HotSpot3D (Niu et al., 2016) to conduct co-clus-
tering analysis of pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline vari-
ants and somatic mutations on 3D protein structures (STAR
Methods). We identified 56 hybrid clusters containing somatic
mutations and 21 pathogenic germline variants in 35 genes
(Table S6). For example, we observed co-localized VHL germline
variants p.C162F, p.L188V, and p.R167Q/W co-clustering with
somatic mutations affecting seven other nearby residues.
Interestingly, we observed hybrid clusters in the kinase
domain of RET: one includes the co-localized germline variants
p.R912P/p.M918T and 10 other somatic mutations (Figures 7A
and 7B), while the other adjacent cluster includes p.I852M along
with five somatic mutations. Additionally, we also observed
germline VUSs co-clustering with somatic mutations in the
kinase domain of RET and MET (Figure 7B), potentially providing
additional evidence for pathogenicity. One MET kinase domain
cluster centered around residue p.H1112, where the known
pathogenic germline variant p.H1112R and the somatic mutation
p.H1112Y resides. This cluster contained additional somatic
mutations including p.T1114S and the pathogenic p.V1110I
and a germline VUS p.H1097R. We further identified a RET
kinase domain cluster containing co-localized germline VUSs
p.R844L/Q and p.R846V and co-clustered VUSs p.R817C and
p.E843K (Figure 7B), some of which show additional evidence
of functionality. For example, RET p.E843K is associated with
high expression (97th percentile) and potential enrichment in
the cancer population (p = 1.7E�4) (Table S2).
Because of the preponderance of variants in RET especially in
and around the kinase domain, we assessed their functionality
by conducting experimental validation of 12 unique germline
variants in RET, including 3 pathogenic variants and 9 VUSs
(STAR Methods). Additionally, we selected a constitutively active
positive control p.C618F and a kinase-dead negative control
p.K758M (Table S6).
We evaluated the activity of the RET variants by monitoring the
downstream pMAPK levels by western blot in the absence of its
ligand GDNF (STAR Methods). We first measured RET activity
through the ratio of pMAPK/RET/GAPDH (Figure 7C). As ex-
pected, the constitutively active p.C618F showed ligand-inde-
pendent activation, whereas the kinase-dead p.K758M showed
background levels of pMAPK. The MEN2B syndrome-associ-
ated p.M918T also exhibited higher activity, consistent with the
severe disease phenotype, whereas all other germline VUSs
found in this study did not show significant change in activity
when pMAPK was used as a readout.
Activating mutations tend to couple with upregulation of the
oncogenes, as seen for RET MEN2 alleles and MET p.H1112R
in our cohort (Figure 4B) and somatic mutations of receptor tyro-
sine kinases (Bose et al., 2013). We thus analyzed the results by
measuring RET activity by pMAPK/GAPDH not controlled for the
dynamic RET expression (Figure 7C). While p.R912P was previ-
ously shown to co-segregate in familial medullary thyroid carci-
noma (Jimenez et al., 2004), our results demonstrate that it may
also show ligand-independent activation (t test using pooled
standard deviation [SD], unadjusted p = 0.0019). Multiple other
variants also showed minor upregulation of activity that could
be adaptive in a permissive environment, warranting further
investigation (Figure 7D).
Nomination of VUSs Using Combined Evidences
Promisingly, our integrative approaches can be further applied to
nominate VUSs, connecting them to potential functionality.
Cell 173, 355–370, April 5, 2018

 Among the 540 prioritized VUSs (Figure 1), we discovered 47
additional predisposition variants while requiring at least two
lines of evidence involving case-control frequency, LOH, expres-
sion effect, and co-localization with recurrent mutations and
PTMs (Figure S2 and Table S2). These include six incidences
of cancer-enriched (p = 1E�4) ERCC2 p.F544fs, three each of

ated POLH and FANCM variants, whose carriers all showed

These approaches of functional assessment will likely inform
future guidelines of variant classification.
DISCUSSION
We present the largest catalog of germline variants of cancer to
date in 10,389 individuals spanning 33 cancers (Figure 1). A total
of 853 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were discovered
in 8% of adult cancer cases, a fraction comparable to recent
investigations in smaller cohorts of pediatric and adult cancers
(Cheng et al., 2017; Parsons et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2015).
This comprehensive survey allowed us to establish enrichment
of pathogenic or likely pathogenic factors in each cancer (Fig-
ure 2) from BRCA1/2 in OV and BRCA to RET/SDHB/VHL/NF1/
SDHD in PCPG. Our analysis also identified putative new asso-
ciations, e.g., PALB2 in STAD and BUB1B in GBM/LUSC that
warrant further study. Further, the concurrent systematic discov-
ery of CNVs revealed 18 rare events, including deletion of ATM,
BRCA1, and NF1 associated with clear expression changes (Fig-
ure 5), suggesting the importance of other genomic events
beyond SNPs and small insertions and deletions.
We fully acknowledge that although this cohort presents one
of the largest systematic analysis to date, our power to detect
predisposition genes harboring rare variants is still limited,
potentially requiring 100,000 samples to achieve 80% power
for rare variants of 95% penetrance (Figure S7). Similar power
limitation applies to clinical association. We validated previously
found predisposition genes associated with earlier onset ages in
various cancer types (Table S7). We also investigated variants
found in 552 cancer cases with known familial history (Figure S7).
While difficulties abound for collecting family information (i.e.,
non-cohesive family history collection, absent family history for
many projects), improved curation of such data will be pivotal
for investigation of predisposing variants.
Most of the known predisposing factors in cancer are found in
tumor suppressors; however, an intriguing smaller set of condi-
tions are associated with heritable activating mutations in onco-
genes, such as MET p.H1112R in hereditary papillary renal
carcinoma (Schmidt et al., 1998). By conducting the first system-
atic discovery of germline variants, we discovered 33 such
variants in oncogenes, including missenses in MET, RET, and
PTPN11. Particularly, we found pathogenic RET variants associ-
ated with high gene expression not only in PCPG but also in LGG,
KIRP, and READ. The pathogenic RET allele p.R912P (Figure 7)
showed potential ligand-independent activation. However, our
assay failed to establish functional change in other alleles of
familial medullary thyroid cancer, including p.I852M (currently
with conflicting evidence in ClinVar) and p.R844Q (currently a
VUS in ClinVar). It is possible that MEN2-associated alleles
exhibit higher expressivity and have easier-to-detect molecular
functional changes. Weaker gain-of-function RET alleles may
exhibit activity depending on cellular context. Additional epige-
netics mechanisms such as upregulation of gene expression
may be required for these alleles to achieve their activating po-
tential, such as the candidate germline RET VUS p.E843K, which
is associated with enrichment in cancer population, high gene
expression, and conservation among homologs, but showed
no gain of activity in our assay. Further, several cancer genes,
including PTPN11 (Li et al., 2012) show both tumor-promoting
or suppressing roles depending on the context. Our results
demonstrate the importance of experimental investigation of
the pathogenic variants in adequate conditions.
Historically, germline variants have often been overlooked by
classification systems due to the lack of evidence in currently
available databases and the lack of somatic mutation informa-
tion in the current ACMG-AMP classification system. In partic-
ular, our approach demonstrated the utility of tumor and
normal-matched sequencing for germline variant interpretation
in that they are required to discover two-hit events, including
LOH or biallelic events (Figure 3). Within each individual cancer
case, we observed that 34% and 4.3% of pathogenic or likely
pathogenic germline variants exhibit LOH and biallelic events,
respectively (Figure 3C). At the cohort level, we identified
germline variants and somatic mutations affecting the same res-
idues. While these approaches provide systematic evaluation of
germline variants, careful assessments are required to separate
effects from compounding factors, such as passenger somatic
copy number events that may induce LOH. Such information
may also help validate oncogenic effects of variants in pleio-
tropic genes (Table S2).
Further, by analyzing tumor expression data from RNA-seq, we
identified that approximately half of the variants in tumor suppres-
sors were associated with low gene expression, and 62% of var-
iants in oncogenes were associated with high expression (Fig-
ure 4B), confirming and expanding findings of germline variants
in BRCA1/2 and mismatch repair genes associated with low
gene expression (Hilton et al., 2002; Morak et al., 2017). While
the association between truncating mutations and reduced
gene expression is intuitive, it should not be taken for granted:
even for predisposition genes, we observed various degrees of
reduced gene expression in truncation carriers (Figure S4). Such
evidence was used to highlight potentially functional genes
affected by somatic mutations (Ding et al., 2015) and can also
likely validate transcriptional effect of germline variants (Figure 4).
Germline variants overlapping PTMs suggest signaling as a
possible predisposition mechanism of cancer. Beyond the two
pathogenic variants that directly overlapped PTM sites (TP53
and PTEN) and additional proximal variants (Figure 6C), selected
prioritized VUSs also showed the potential of modulating PTMs
(Table S6). For example, multiple TP53 variants directly replace
arginine residues affected by protein methylation (R156H,
R158C, R290C, and R333G), potentially affecting the target
gene specificity of TP53 (Jansson et al., 2008). The BRCA1
p.Q1281P variant occurs in a known binding site of the ATR
kinase that phosphorylates BRCA1 site p.S1280 in response to
DNA damage (Tibbetts et al., 2000). The substitution replaces
a known kinase binding motif of ATR and induces a new motif
preferred by cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) (Figure S6) and
potentially rewires signaling.
Overall, we systematically examined predisposition variants
and their corresponding functional evidence of more than
10,000 samples. The catalog of pathogenic variants in 33 cancer
types informs our knowledge of genetic inheritance of cancer.
Cell 173, 355–370, April 5, 2018

 Further, the results showed that each germline allele should be
carefully evaluated within the relevant context of its correspond-
ing somatic genome and downstream expression. Such evi-
dence will not only aid validation of pathogenic variants but
also prioritization within large pools of VUSs and discovery into
the non-coding genome.

 EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
TCGA Samples
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) collected both tumor and non-tumor biospecimens from 10,224 human samples with
informed consent under authorization of local institutional review boards (https://cancergenome.nih.gov/abouttcga/policies/
informedconsent). TCGA sequence information was obtained from the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP). Sequence
data from germline and tumor samples were downloaded by the Institute for Systems Biology Cancer Genomics Cloud (ISB-CGC)
from the Genome Data Commons (GDC) legacy (GRCh37/hg19) archive. For a complete list of the TCGA cancer type abbreviations,
please see https://gdc.cancer.gov/resources-tcga-users/tcga-code-tables/tcga-study-abbreviations.
Cell Lines
For the RET functional assay, we used HEK293T cells. The sex of the HEK293T cells is female. Cells were cultured at 37�C in DMEM
(Corning) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Thermo Fisher).
METHOD DETAILS
Data Generation
Germline variant calling and filtering
For TCGA sequence data downloaded from the GDC, we selected one germline sample and up to one tumor sample per case
according to the following procedure. Files designated as TCGA MC3 BAMs were prioritized due to their harmonization. A dockerized
version of GenomeVIP (Mashl et al., 2017) was used to coordinate germline variant calling in the guise of integrating multiple tools:
Germline SNVs were identified using Varscan (Koboldt et al., 2012) (version 2.3.8 with default parameters, except where –min-var-
freq 0.10,–p value 0.10,–min-coverage 3,–strand-filter 1) operating on a mpileup stream produced by SAMtools (version 1.2 with
default parameters, except where -q 1 -Q 13) and GATK (McKenna et al., 2010) (version 3.5, using its haplotype caller in single-sam-
ple mode with duplicate and unmapped reads removed and retaining calls with a minimum quality threshold of 10). Germline indels
were identified using Varscan (version and parameters as above) and GATK (version and parameters as above) in single-sample
mode. We also applied Pindel (Ye et al., 2009) (version 0.2.5b8 with default parameters, except where -x 4, -I, -B 0, and -M 3 and
excluded centromere regions (genome.ucsc.edu)) for indel prediction. For all analyses, we used the GRCh37-lite reference and spec-
ified an insertion size of 500 whenever this information was not provided in the BAM header.
All resulting variants were limited to coding regions of full-length transcripts obtained from Ensembl release 70 plus the additional
two base pairs flanking each exon that cover splice donor/acceptor sites. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were based on the union
of raw GATK and VarScan calls. We required that indels were called by at least two out of the three callers (GATK, Varscan, Pindel). In
addition, we also included high-confidence, Pindel-unique calls (at least 30x coverage and 20% VAF).
We then further required the variants to have an Allelic Depth (AD) R 5 for the alternative allele. A total of 49,123 variants passed
these filters. We then conducted readcount analyses for these variants in both normal and tumor samples. We used bam-readcount
(version 0.8.0 commit 1b9c52c, with parameters -q 10, -b 15) to quantify the number of reference and alternative alleles. We required
the variants to have at least 5 counts of the alternative allele and an alternative allele frequency of at least 20%, resulting in 31,963
variants. Of these, we filtered for rare variants with % 0.05% allele frequency in 1000 Genomes and ExAC (release r0.3.1).
We then selected for cancer-relevant pathogenic variants, based on whether they were found in the curated cancer variant data-
base or in the curated cancer predisposition gene list, and their associated ClinVar trait. This resulted in 1,678 variants for manual
review using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) software (Robinson et al., 2011). For candidate germline variants having the
same genomic change as somatic mutations, we further filtered for the germline variants that may have originated from contaminated
adjacent normal samples by eliminating variants called from adjacent normal, the VAF in normal < 30%, and co-localizing with any
known somatic mutation. This results in the final 1,393 pass-QC variants for downstream analysis.
We further annotated the corresponding genes of variants as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. We compiled a gene list by
combining the oncogenes and tumor suppressors from Vogelstein et al. (Vogelstein et al., 2013) and the GSEA database (down-
loaded 2014-11-25). We removed NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 from the oncogene classification in GSEA given their controversial roles.
We then further curated several genes, including additional tumor suppressors (ATR, BARD1, ERCC1, FANCI, FANCL, FANCM,
POLD1, POLE, POLH, RAD50, RAD51, RAD51C, RAD51D, RAD54L, MAX) and additional oncogenes (AR, STAT3, TERT, MAP2K2).
Genotype data
We used SNP-array derived genotype data of 522,606 SNPs to infer the ethnicity of each sample. Birdseed genotype files of 11,459
samples were downloaded by ISB-CGC from the Genome Data Commons (GDC) legacy (GRCh37/hg19) archive and converted by
us to individual VCF files (https://github.com/ding-lab/birdseed2vcf.) for merging into a single combined VCF file. SNP-array geno-
types were also used to assess the precision of germline variant calling in the exome (median precision: 0.99).
Somatic mutation calls
We used TCGA MC3 MAF v3 (updated 17 June 2016) for comprehensive somatic mutation calls across TCGA cancer samples.
Specifically, we used mc3.v0.2.8.PUBLIC.maf (www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn7214402/files/).
e2
Cell 173, 355–370.e1–e6, April 5, 2018
 Somatic copy number variation
We used somatic CNV calls generated using GISTIC for the PanCanAtlas analyses working groups (https://www.synapse.org/#!
Synapse:syn5049520.1).
The threshold for calling a somatic CNV was defined using a stepwise process:
(1) We calculated the median log2 copy-ratio level for each arm.
(2) We found the highest and lowest arm medians, H and L.
(3) We opened a small margin H’ = H+delta and L’ = L-delta (delta = 0.1).
(4) We assigned +2 to any segment that is above H’, and �2 to segments below L’.
(5) Segments that were between +delta and H’ get a +1 and segments between -delta and L’ get a �1.
(6) Segments between -delta and +delta get a 0.
�2 scores track with homozygous deletions because whole arms are never homozygously deleted. However, since many tumors
have undergone whole genome doubling, in tetraploid tumors and above the min arm level can be 2 copies, and so these �2 scores
can represent those with either 0 or 1 copy of a gene. +2 scores track with high level focal amplification since these are usually beyond
the highest arm level change. We considered somatics with �1 or �2 as a deletion and +1 or +2 as an amplification.
Clinical data
We used the clinical data provided by the PanCanAtlas clinical working group (https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn3241074/
files/). For family history information, we used the Clinical data used by the MC3 working group. Ancestry calls of each sample
was provided by the PanCanAtlas Ancestry Informative Markers (AIM) working group.
Bioinformatics Analyses
Database curation for variant classification
At the gene level, we extended the 114 cancer predisposition genes compiled by Rahman (2014) to a total of 152 genes that
contribute to cancer susceptibility based on literature review (Table S1). We added 15 genes based on the St. Jude PCGP germline
study (both the autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive cancer predisposition genes), 11 genes from our curation of literature,
11 genes from Cancer Gene Census-Germline (Downloaded 1/5/2016 from http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/census/) and DROSHA
(related to DICER1). Source and reference for each gene is attached in Table S1.
At the variant level, in addition to the ClinVar database, we compiled multiple curated gene-specific databases for more compre-
hensive coverage of known pathogenic variants. These included the IARC TP53 germline mutation database, NHGRI BRCA1 and
BRCA2 BIC database (https://research.nhgri.nih.gov/bic/), ARUP MEN2 database for mutations in RET (http://www.arup.utah.
edu/database/MEN2/MEN2_display.php), and the ASU database (http://telomerase.asu.edu/diseases.html) for TERT mutations.
We included only the BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants marked as clinically important in the BIC database. We also limited our TP53
variants to those that were carried by an affected proband and confirmed as a germline variant in the IARC database. We used
TransVar (Zhou et al., 2015) and customized scripts to convert all variant entries to standard HGVSg format to ensure proper
matching.
Variant classification pipeline and panel review
Briefly, we developed an automatic pipeline termed CharGer (https://github.com/ding-lab/CharGer) to annotate and prioritize
variants by adopting the AMP-ACMG guideline. For the automatic pipeline, we defined 12 pathogenic evidence levels and 4 benign
evidence levels using a number of datasets, including ExAC and ClinVar (parsed through MacArthur lab ClinVar: https://github.com/
macarthur-lab/clinvar), and computational tools including SIFT (Kumar et al., 2009) and PolyPhen (Adzhubei et al., 2013). The detailed
implementation and score of each evidence level is as follows (Table S3): PVS1, PSC1, PM4, PP2, and PPC1: variants in predisposing
genes. Variants in the predisposition gene receive one of these evidence level assignments based on variant type and mode of
inheritance. Truncations in susceptibility genes that harbor variants with a dominant mode of inheritance are assigned PVS1, but
recessive variants in these genes are assigned PSC1. Considering the PVS1 criteria ‘‘null variant in a gene where LOF is a known
mechanism of disease,’’ we only assigned this evidence to truncations in tumor suppressor genes but not oncogenes. Protein length
changes due to inframe insertions or deletions or nonstop variants in genes that harbor variants with a dominant mode of inheritance
receive a PM4, whereas recessives receive a PPC1. Finally, missense variants in susceptibility genes are tagged as PP2.
PS1 and PM5: pathogenic peptide changes. Variants that result in identical peptide changes as a previously known pathogenic
variant on ClinVar (only those marked as Pathogenic but not Likely Pathogenic) or the compiled list are assigned a PS1. Variants
that result in a different amino-acid change at the same position are assigned a PM5.
PM1: hotspot variants. HotSpot3D (Niu et al., 2016) was run on MC3 somatic mutation calls (hypermutators removed). The protein
structure analysis of HotSpot3D identifies mutation clusters, enriched by recurrent and neighboring pockets of mutations. If a
germline variant was found to be a somatic mutation with recurrence in at least two samples among all cancer types in a HotSpot3D
cluster, then the variant is flagged with a pathogenic characterization of PM1.
PM2 and BA1: minor allele frequency in populations. Variants that are absent or that show extremely low frequency (MAF < 0.0005)
in the ExAC dataset are assigned a PM2, whereas common variants (MAF > 0.05) receive a BA1.
PP3 and BP4: in silico analyses. Several ACMG scores use in silico evidence to determine disease association. We used evidence
from SIFT (Kumar et al., 2009) and PolyPhen (Adzhubei et al., 2010), as annotated by VEP (McLaren et al., 2016). Each in silico
Cell 173, 355–370.e1–e6, April 5, 2018
e3
 analysis was taken as one piece of evidence and if both analyses identified as ‘‘damaging’’ or ‘‘deleterious’’ in SIFT (score < 0.05) and
‘‘probably damaging’’ from PolyPhen (score > 0.432), the variant was assigned a pathogenic characterization of PP3. Conversely, if
both in silico analyses identify in opposition to PP3 characterization (> 0.05 for SIFT, < 0.432 for PolyPhen), then the variant achieves a
benign characterization of BP4. The score from each fulfilled evidence level is then summed and classified as described in Figure 1C.
Detection of germline copy number variation events
Whole exome sequencing data on normal samples from 10,389 cases were used for germline CNV detection. XHMM was run as pre-
viously described (Ruderfer et al., 2016). Base-resolution coverage was calculated by the GATK DepthOfCoverage module (mapping
quality > 20) on 209,486 Ensembl coding exon intervals (build GRCh37) retrieved from UCSC Table Browser. Exon targets with
extreme GC content (> 90% or < 10%) or high fraction of repeat-masked bases (> 25%) or extreme length (< 10bp or > 10kbp) or
low mean depth (< 10) were filtered out. The target-by-sample depth matrix was mean-centered by target dimension. Then principal
component analysis was run to remove the systematic bias, where the top 152 components were removed (whose variances were
higher than 70% of the mean variances of all components). The resulting depth matrix was normalized to sample-level z-score.
During normalization, targets with high variance (standard deviation > 50) were filtered out. CNVs discovery was performed using
the Viterbi hidden Markov model (HMM) with default XHMM parameters. Quality for each called CNV was calculated by the for-
ward-backward HMM algorithm, as previously described (Fromer and Purcell, 2014).
Array-based CNVs were filtered based on the number of probes (> 10), length (> 10kb), frequency (< 1%), and absolute segment
mean value (jlog2(copy-number/ 2)j > 0.1). After filtering, the array-based CNV callset consisted of 209,559 CNVs found across 6464
individuals.
Analysis of germline variants in post-translational modification (PTM) sites
The dataset of pathogenic germline predisposition variants corresponding to amino acid substitutions were mapped to preferred
isoforms and four types of post-translational modification (PTM) sites (phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, and methylation)
using multiple databases, including ActiveDriverDB (Krassowski et al., 2018), PhosphoSitePlus (Hornbeck et al., 2015) and UniProt
Knowledge Base (The UniProt Consortium, 2017). This compiled dataset contains information about previously published PTM sites
from experimental studies, such as mass spectrometry and western blots. Variants were considered to affect PTM sites if the cor-
responding amino acid substitutions affected protein sequence within ± seven amino acids of the PTM site, similar to earlier studies
(Reimand et al., 2013, 2015). Four categories of PTM site substitutions were considered: direct substitutions replaced the central
amino acid undergoing post-translational modification, proximal substitutions affected amino acids within ± two amino acids around
the nearest PTM site, and distal substitutions affected amino acids within ± three to seven amino acids around the nearest PTM site.
This resulted in a total number of 316,216 experimentally collected sites; 239,559 phosphorylation sites, 39,493 ubiquitination sites,
13,376 methylation sites, and 23,787 acetylation sites. We further noted network-rewiring substitutions that induced or removed an
amino acid near a PTM site that occurred within a kinase binding motif as predicted by the MIMP algorithm (Wagih et al., 2015). Ev-
idence of kinases and other enzymes involved in the mutated PTM sites was also extracted from the databases and associated to
primary literature.
Co-localizing and co-clustering of somatic mutations and germline variants
We used somatic mutation calls from the TCGA MC3 MAF, defining germline variants located at the same protein residue as recurrent
(n R 3) somatic mutations as co-localizing. We adapted our previously published tool HotSpot3D (Niu et al., 2016)(v.1.8.0) to conduct
co-clustering of TCGA MC3 somatic mutations and pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants in genes with available PDB
structures.
RET variant function assays
HEK293T cells were authenticated by DNA finger printing targeting short tandem repeat (STR) profiles through Genetica Cell Line
Testing. They are negative for mycoplasma as determined by the absence of extranuclear signals in DAPI staining. Cells were
cultured at 37�C in DMEM (Corning) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Thermo Fisher). Constructions expressing
RET variants were generated by Q5 site-directed mutagenesis (New England BioLabs) using a plasmid expressing a wild-type
RET (pcDNA3RET9) (Chatterjee et al., 2012) as a template. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Cells were transiently
transfected with wild-type or mutant RET constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen Life Technologies) in six-well plates.
Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were switched to medium containing 0.5% FBS for 24 h before the initiation of 20 minutes
of treatment with GDNF (100nM) in a subset of samples. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl,
1 mM Na2EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM b-glycerophosphate,
1 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mg/ml leupeptin (Cell Signaling Technology). Protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche)
were added immediately before use. Samples (15 ug/lane) were boiled in standard commercial SDS-gel loading buffer and run on
SDS 10% polyacrylamide gels. Immunoblotting was performed on Immobilon-P PVDF membrane (Millipore). The following anti-
bodies were used for immunoblotting: rabbit monoclonal anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) (Thr202/204) antibodies (Cell
Signaling #4370S, at 1:1000 dilution), rabbit polyclonal anti-RET (C31B4) antibodies (Cell Signaling #3223S, at 1:1000 dilution), rabbit
monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibodies (Cell Signaling #5174, at 1:1000 dilution), rabbit monoclonal anti-phospho-RET (Tyr905) anti-
bodies (Cell Signaling #3221 1:1000 dilution), rabbit monoclonal anti-phospho-AKT (Ser473) antibodies (Cell Signaling #4060
1:1000 dilution), mouse monoclonal anti-RET (C-3) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies #sc-365943 1:100 dilution). Appropriate
secondary antibodies with infrared dyes (LI-COR) were used, such as donkey anti-rabbit antibodies for the 680nm channel (LI-COR
e4
Cell 173, 355–370.e1–e6, April 5, 2018
 926-6807) and donkey anti-mouse antibodies for the 800nm channel (LI_COR 926-32212). Protein bands were visualized using the
Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR) and further quantified by ImageJ.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Burden testing of pathogenic variants
We adapted the Total Frequency Test (TFT) (Basu and Pan, 2011) by collapsing pathogenic and likely pathogenic germline variants to
the gene level. We then used total allele counts of pathogenic variants identified in the ExAC nonTCGA cohort using the same
CharGer classification pipeline for comparison. We deemed one cancer type shows potentially increased burden of a specific
gene if the TFT test against ExAC returned FDR < 0.15.
We then tested burden of pathogenic variants for each cancer type and each gene against all other cancer cohorts as controls,
subtracting out the cohorts showing suggestive enrichment for the specific gene in the ExAC analyses. Since all our cohorts are
called using the same variant calling pipeline, it avoids the potential danger of comparing against ExAC, which was done in a different
batch of variant calls. The resulting p values were adjusted to FDR using the standard Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. We subse-
quently defined significant and suggestive events in terms of FDR thresholds of 0.05 and 0.15, respectively.
LOH and biallelic events analysis
We applied our previously developed statistical analysis method regarding LOH (Lu et al., 2015) to individually test the missense and
truncation germline variant sets. We tested variants in genes carrying pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants and used variants in
other genes to build the null distribution. The resulting p values were adjusted to FDR again using the standard Benjamini-Hochberg
procedure. We subsequently defined significant and suggestive events in terms of FDR thresholds of 0.05 and 0.15, respectively. We
further captured additional events of suggestive LOH using a criteria of tumor VAF > 0.6 and normal VAF < 0.6.
We then devised an algorithm to classify observed LOH events (both significant and suggestive, FDR < 0.15) as:
(1) Wild-type allele copy number deletion (of the wild-type allele): GISTIC CNV result shows lower ploidy below threshold in the
gene region. In these reads, the variant allele is significantly enriched compared to the wild-type allele, which is likely loss.
(2) Alternative allele copy number amplification: GISTIC CNV result shows higher ploidy above threshold in the gene region. In these
reads, the variant allele, which is likely amplified, is significantly enriched compared to the wild-type allele.
For biallelic events analysis, we systematically examined the cases carrying both a pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variant
and a missense or truncating somatic mutation in the same gene. The lolliplots are constructed and modified from the PCGP protein
paint (https://pecan.stjude.cloud/proteinpaint) based on the specified RefSeq transcript.
Gene expression analysis
TCGA level-3 normalized RNA expression data were downloaded from Firehose (2016/1/28 analysis archive). The expression
percentile of individual genes in each cancer cohort was calculated using the empirical cumulative distribution function (ecdf), as
implemented in R. We then used the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to compare the expression percentile distribution
between variants of oncogenes and tumor suppressors. We also applied the linear regression model to evaluate the protein/phos-
phoprotein expression percentile difference between carriers of pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant and non-carriers in cancers
where there are at least 3 carriers. The resulting p values were adjusted to FDR again using the standard Benjamini-Hochberg
procedure.
To examine the possible location-based effect of truncations, we fitted a linear regression model using expression percentile as the
dependent variable and a Boolean indicator to label whether or not the truncation is located at the last 50 base pair of the transcript,
controlling for variant classification and truncation variant type.
RPPA analysis
TCGA level-3 normalized RPPA expression data of the tumor samples were downloaded from Firehose (2016/1/28 analysis archive).
The expression percentile of individual genes in each cancer cohort was calculated using the empirical cumulative distribution func-
tion (ecdf), as implemented in R. We then applied the linear regression model to evaluate the protein/phosphoprotein expression
percentile difference between carriers of pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant and non-carriers in cancers where there are at least
3 carriers. The resulting p values were adjusted to FDR again using the standard Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.
Association testing of single variants
We conducted association testing of pathogenic germline variants using a one-tailed Fisher’s exact test where the alternative
hypothesis assumes the tested variant is enriched in TCGA cases compared to non-TCGA cases in the ExAC data (release
r0.3.1). To avoid potential false discovery due to population structures, we used the most powered cohort in ExAC, the Non-Finnish
European that included 33,370 samples. For allele numbers (AN) and allele counts (AC), we used the adjusted counts, where only
individuals with genotype quality (GQ) R 20 and depth (DP) R 10 were included. Vcfanno (Pedersen et al., 2016) was used to anno-
tate allele frequencies of the germline variants. TCGA allele counts were inferred through subtracting ExAC non-TCGA allele counts
from ExAC total allele counts. We conducted the single variant association analysis for all alleles.

 Enrichment of variants overlapping somatic mutation and PCGP pathogenic variants
To test whether there is a significant overlap between pathogenic germline variants and (1) recurrent somatic mutation, and (2) PCGP
pathogenic variants, we conducted a one-sided exact Poisson test where the alternative hypothesis is that the true event rate
(overlapping rate) is higher than the background rate. The background event rate is defined as the number of (1) recurrent somatic
mutation and (2) PCGP variants divided by the size of the exon (49,586,385 bp) that we conduct our analysis based on. The time base
of the event is defined as the number of likely pathogenic or pathogenic variants we observed (n = 852).
Enrichment of variants in PTM sites
To evaluate the enrichment of pathogenic variants in PTM sites, we conducted an empirical permutation-based enrichment test by
sampling protein substitutions from the 1000 Genomes dataset as controls. We only focused on the subset of proteins with at least
one PTM site. We then sampled substitutions equal to the number of observed pathogenic amino acid substitutions for 100,000
iterations. The median number of PTM-associated substitutions expected by chance alone was eight. We then used this estimate
as the rate parameter to the Poisson distribution, deriving a p value from the probability of observing an equal or greater number
of PTM-associated substitutions to our observed number of unique PTM-associated substitutions among pathogenic cancer
variants.
Age at onset association analysis
We used a linear regression model to identify associations between age at onset and germline variant carrier of predisposition genes.
We then tested genes with greater than or equal to 3 pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants and 1% carriers in individual cancer
cohorts. For both the ethnicity and age at onset association analyses, the resulting p values were again adjusted using the Benjamini-
Hochberg procedure.
Statistical analysis of activity of RET variants
Statistical testing of the western blotting data quantified using ImageJ was conducted using the R programming language. t test
using pooled SD was applied to compare the normalized ratio of pMAPK/RET/GAPDH or pMAPK/GAPDH for cells carrying each
of the mutant construct versus wilt-type construct.

Figure S6. Cancer-Associated Germline Variants in PTM Sites Implicate Potential Mechanistic Hypotheses, Related to Figure 6
(A) More than 45% of protein amino acid substitutions in our dataset affect post-translational modification (PTM) sites, significantly more than expected from
chance alone. Direct substitutions replace post-translationally modified amino acids with non-modified acids (dark red), and proximal and distal substitutions lie
within 1-2 and 3-7 amino acids from closest PTM site (orange and yellow, respectively).
(B) The majority of PTM-associated substitutions affect phosphorylation, the largest PTM dataset in our study. Substitutions that affect sites with multiple different
types of PTM are also apparent.
(C) Genes with germline substitutions in PTM sites include known cancer genes like TP53, BRCA1, RET, VHL, PTEN, and others. Colors represent the impact of
variants on PTM sites.
(D) Analysis of extended germline variant data from TCGA shows that TP53 carries six germline substitutions in three protein methylation sites that are known to
regulate its DNA damage response through altered target gene specificity.
(E) MET and ATM substitutions are predicted to induce motif rewiring events that lead to the loss of an existing AKT1 binding site and the introduction of a new
binding site for AURKA, respectively.
(F) Site-specific interaction network of predicted enzyme-substrate interactions as predicted by the MIMP algorithm.
 Figure S7. Variants in Familial Cases and Power to Identify Predisposition Genes in Case-Control Cohorts, Related to Figure 2
(A) Pathogenic variants identified in the 552 cancer cases with known familial history of cancer. Each color indicates the type of familial history recorded in the
TCGA clinical data.
(B) Power analysis of burden analysis to identify predisposition genes in cohort sizes ranging from 100 to 300k.
