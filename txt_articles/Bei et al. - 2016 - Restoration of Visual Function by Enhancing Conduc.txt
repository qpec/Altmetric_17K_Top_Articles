In Brief
Regenerated retinal axons can form
functional synapses but exhibit poor
conduction and thus fail to mediate
functional recovery. Treatment with
voltage-gated potassium channel
blockers enhances conduction of
regenerated axons and results in
significant recovery of visual acuity.

SUMMARY
Although a number of repair strategies have been
shown to promote axon outgrowth following neu-
ronal injury in the mammalian CNS, it remains un-
clear whether regenerated axons establish functional
synapses and support behavior. Here, in both
juvenile and adult mice, we show that either PTEN
and SOCS3 co-deletion, or co-overexpression of os-
teopontin (OPN)/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1)/
ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), induces regrowth
of retinal axons and formation of functional synapses
in the superior colliculus (SC) but not significant
recovery of visual function. Further analyses sug-
gest that regenerated axons fail to conduct action
potentials from the eye to the SC due to lack of
myelination. Consistent with this idea, administration
of voltage-gated potassium channel blockers re-
stores conduction and results in increased visual
acuity. Thus, enhancing both regeneration and con-
duction effectively improves function after retinal
axon injury.
INTRODUCTION
During neural development, a series of complex processes
transform initial patterns of neuronal connectivity into optimized
functional circuits that underlie behavior. As axons reach their
targets, they form weak synapses that subsequently undergo
both activity-independent and experience-dependent matura-
tion and refinement (Hensch, 2005; Hong and Chen, 2011; Ack-
man and Crair, 2014). Moreover, formation of myelin sheaths
around axons enhances the speed and reliability of neural trans-
mission. Progressive myelination during early postnatal and
adolescent life allows fast and reliable propagation of neuronal
activity along axons as the nervous system increases in size.
However, it remains unknown whether a similar multi-step pro-
cess of functional circuit regeneration can occur following axon
injury in adulthood.
In cases of injury to the CNS such as traumatic brain injury and
spinal cord injury, a key pathological event is the severing of
long-projection axons, leading to the disruptions of relevant cir-
cuits (Case and Tessier-Lavigne, 2005; Blesch and Tuszynski,
2009; Fawcett et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2014). Therefore, an ideal
repair strategy would be to first promote regeneration of injured
axons, followed by formation of new synapses with the discon-
nected target, and finally, optimization for proper functionality
and reliability of the rebuilt circuits. Such restoration of function
is robust following injury to sensory or motor axons in the
mammalian peripheral nervous system, but is problematic in
the CNS.
Based on recent findings in understanding the molecular and
cellular mechanisms underlying regeneration failure, a number
of strategies have been developed to enhance axon regenera-
tion in the adult CNS. For example, neutralization or removal
of growth inhibitory activities has been shown to enhance the
regrowth of limited types of CNS axons with significant func-
tional outcomes (Yiu and He, 2006; Lee and Zheng, 2008;
Chew et al., 2012; Cregg et al., 2014; Schwab and Strittmatter,
2014; Silver et al., 2015). In addition, regeneration can be
enhanced by manipulating regulators of signaling pathways
related to neuronal growth, such as PTEN/mTOR and SOCS3/
STAT3 (Park et al., 2008; Smith et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2010; Belin
et al., 2015), as well as development-associated transcription
factors such as Kru
¨ ppel-like family of transcription factors
(Moore et al., 2009; Blackmore et al., 2012). For example, we
found that genetic deletion of both PTEN and SOCS3 greatly
invigorates the intrinsic regenerative ability of injured retinal gan-
glion cells (RGCs), resulting in robust long-distance axon regen-
eration in an intraorbital optic nerve injury model (Sun et al.,
2011). Furthermore, our recent studies showed that overexpres-
sion of an extracellular protein osteopontin (OPN) in RGCs al-
lowed them to regenerate their injured axons in the presence
of IGF1 or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), pointing
to a potentially translatable approach of activating neuronal
mTOR pathway and promoting axon regeneration (Duan et al.,
2015).
It remains unclear, however, the extent to which axons
induced to regenerate can form functional synapses with their
presumptive targets in an adult neural network. To address this

 issue, we used an optic tract transection model that minimizes
the distance axons need to regenerate to their targets. We
were therefore able to systematically test post-regeneration
steps that are critical for restoration of visual function. We
discovered that regenerating axons indeed form functional syn-
apses but exhibit poor conduction likely associated with lack
of myelination. Strikingly, we showed that improving axon con-
duction by pharmacological means could lead to significant vi-
sual function recovery when combined with substantial axon
regeneration.
RESULTS
Retinocollicular Axon Regeneration Induced by
Co-deletion of PTEN and SOCS3 in a Unilateral Optic
Tract Transection Model
RGC axons regeneration after intraorbital optic nerve crush need
to grow for a long distance before reaching their CNS targets.
With manipulations such as PTEN and SOCS3 co-deletion that
have been effective in promoting regeneration, only a small num-
ber of regenerating axons cross the optic chiasm and even fewer
reach their targets (Sun et al., 2011; Luo et al., 2013). To examine
post-regeneration events, we therefore adopted an optic tract
injury model (So et al., 1981; Chen et al., 1997), in which the optic
tract is transected unilaterally just proximal to the SC in postnatal
day 6 (P6) mice (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1). This significantly re-
duces the distance regenerating axons must travel to reach their
target. We used mice at P6 because the SC is not yet covered by
the cortex at this age, rendering the optic tract accessible for
surgery.
Immediately after optic tract transection, BCL-2+/PTENf/f/
SOCS3f/f mice were subjected to intravitreous injection of
either AAV-Cre virus to delete PTEN and SOCS3 genes in
the regeneration group or AAV-PLAP (placental alkaline phos-
phatase) virus in the control group (Figure 1C). The BCL-2
transgenic background was chosen for its documented effects
on enhancing neuronal survival following injury (Bonfanti et al.,
1996; Goldberg et al., 2002), while genetic deletion in RGCs of
PTEN and SOCS3, the respective inhibitory molecules of
mTOR and JAK/STAT, for the robust axon regeneration in an
optic nerve injury model (Sun et al., 2011). To further boost
the JAK/STAT activity after SOCS3 deletion (Smith et al.,
2009; Sun et al., 2011), we also injected AAVs expressing
CNTF intravitreously 1 week after injury. Concurrently, we
co-injected AAVs expressing a fusion of channelrhodopsin 2
and mCherry (ChR2-mCherry) so we could visualize RGC
axons and activate them with light.
We first confirmed that our surgical paradigm completely
transected all retinocollicular axons in wild-type mice (Figures
S1A and S1B). Axon regeneration was assessed by two indepen-
dent axonal labeling methods (CTB in Figures 1D–1L or mCherry
in Figure 1M). In the control group (BCL-2+/PTENf/f/SOCS3f/f
with AAV-PLAP), we found little axon labeling in the SC caudal
to the lesion site (Figures 1D–1G, 1L, and 1M). Analysis of serial
sections throughout the entire SC revealed that many axons
retracted and failed to regenerate (Figure S2A). In contrast, in
the regeneration group (BCL-2+/PTENf/f/SOCS3f/f with AAVs-
Cre/CNTF), we discovered significantly higher densities of
regenerating axons both at the lesion site and in the dorsal SC
(Figures 1H–1M and S2B). Together, these results indicated
that our regeneration paradigm successfully elicited robust re-
growth after distal transection of RGC axons, thus enabling us
to assess whether regenerating axons can form new functional
synapses in the SC.
Optogenetic Stimulation of Regenerated Axons at the
SC Triggers Synaptic Responses Detected by Local
Field Potentials
Six to eight weeks after injury, we recorded the evoked local field
potentials (LFP) in response to focal laser stimulation of ChR2-
labeled RGC terminals in the SC of anesthetized mice (Figures
2A and S3). Specifically, we placed the recording electrodes at
least 300 mm distal to the lesion, opto-stimulated the ChR2-pos-
itive axons, and recorded post-lesion- or terminal-evoked LFPs
(Figures 2B and S3). Consistent with our anatomical data, laser
stimulation at axon terminals evoked no detectable LFP in the
post-lesion SC of control-injured mice (Figures 2D and 2F, n =
8 out of 8). Evoked response was detected when the recording
electrode was moved rostrally into the pre-lesion intact area (Fig-
ure S3), indicating that lack of LFP response was not due to low
expression of ChR2. Similarly the same laser stimulation reliably
evoked robust LFPs across the entire intact SC of sham-oper-
ated mice (Figures 2C and 2F, n = 7 out of 7, mean amplitude:
529 ± 22 mV).
In contrast, we were able to record reliable light-evoked re-
sponses in the post-lesion SC of seven out of eight mice in the
regeneration group (Figures 2E, 2F, and S3B, mean amplitude:
136 ± 41 mV). To distinguish the contribution of synaptic from
non-synaptic components, we applied the glutamate receptor
antagonist kynurenic acid (50 mM) locally to the exposed SC
and found that the drug administration acutely and reversibly
diminished the amplitude of the evoked LFP (Figures 2G and
2H). Thus regenerated axons formed functional synapses in
the SC.
Reformation of Functional Synapses Detected by
Whole-Cell Recording
To probe the nature of the regenerated synapses, we performed
whole-cell intracellular recording from SC brain slices 4–5 weeks
after injury (Figure 2I). Consistent with in vivo recordings, light-
evoked postsynaptic responses were detected in SC neurons
located over 300 mm distal to the lesion in regeneration-group
mice (n = 12/12 cells across four mice, Figure 2J) but not
in control-injured mice (n = 0/10 cells across four mice). In
this recording protocol, membrane potential was first held at
�70 mV with magnesium in the solution to block NMDA recep-
tors, allowing AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic currents to be
recorded (Hooks and Chen, 2006; Shah and Crair, 2008). The
membrane potential was then switched to +55 mV to remove
magnesium blockade, and combined currents mediated by
AMPA and NMDA receptors were revealed. As expected,
light-evoked AMPA responses were blocked by the AMPA re-
ceptor antagonist CNQX (10 mM; by 100% of baseline in four
mice) and the NMDA responses blocked by addition of the
NMDA receptor antagonist D-APV (50 mM; by 77% of baseline
in four mice) (Figures 2K and 2L). Together, these results

NMDA glutamatergic receptors in the SC.
Failed Behavioral Recovery Induced by Regenerated
Axons
To ask whether the regenerated synapses in the SC were suffi-
cient to mediate visual behavior, we assayed optomotor function
in freely behaving animals eight weeks after injury. In this assay
(Figure 3A), a mouse is placed on a platform surrounded by four
monitors that show a moving contrast reversal (Prusky et al.,
2004). The mouse optomotor response, defined by the move-

ment of the head tracking the moving
screen, entails proper function of subcor-
tical nuclei including SC (Huberman and
Niell, 2011). The acuity of each eye can
be
measured
independently
as
the
maximal spatial frequency at which the
head is able to track the stimulus (Prusky
et al., 2004; Kang et al., 2013). Mice were
tested blindly with respect to both geno-
type and treatment. As expected, mice in
the control group exhibited a profound
performance defect in the injured but not
in the intact eye (Figures 3B, 4G, and 4H). Surprisingly, the regen-
eration group mice also exhibited poor optomotor acuity; no
response was observed in six of eight animals and the group
score was not significantly different from that of injured control
mice (Figure 3B).
Conduction Blockade in Regenerated Axons
We next asked whether the lack of visual behavior in regenera-
tion-group mice was associated with the failure of action poten-
tials generated in RGCs to reach the targets. To address this
question, we again performed LFP recordings in vivo. Holding

 the recording electrode at a single site in the SC, we re-posi-
tioned the stimulating optical fiber in front of the eye after
recording LFPs evoked by stimulating terminals within the SC
(Figure 3C). Robust eye-evoked LFPs were recorded from
sham-operated mice and their amplitudes were comparable
to those of the terminal-evoked LFPs (Figures 2C and 3D). As

 expected, no eye-evoked LFPs were detected in the control
mice (Figures 3E and 3G versus 2D and 2F). Interestingly, in
regeneration-group mice, eye stimulation elicited only a small
LFP from SC (Figures 3F and 3G): the maximal amplitudes
of the eye-evoked LFP was only 14% of the terminal-evoked
LFP (Figure 3H), and the ratio was similar after a further
6–8 weeks—that is, 14–16 weeks after injury (data not shown).
Thus although functional synapses reform after optic tract injury,
conduction is impaired in the regenerated axons.
Lack of Myelination in Regenerated Axons
Myelination is required for efficient electrical conduction by axons
of many long-projection neurons, including those of RGCs. Con-
flicting results have been reported on myelination of regenerated
axons in the adult CNS (Alto et al., 2009; de Lima et al., 2012). We
therefore assessed myelination of regenerated retinocollicular
axons in our preparation by labeling SC sections with antibodies
to mCherry (labeling ChR2-mCherry-labeled regenerating axons)
and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG, a marker of myelina-
tion). We readily visualized myelinated axons in sham controls,
but detected no MAG co-localized with ChR2 in and across the
lesion site (Figures 3I and 3J), indicating that regenerated axons
were poorly myelinated. A myelination deficit would expose po-
tassium channels that are otherwise located under the myelin
sheath, resulting in radial dispersion of action potential driven
current into the extracellular space, effectively ‘‘short-circuiting’’
the action potential (Waxman and Ritchie, 1993). Consistent
with this idea, we found that inducing focal demyelination in the
optic tract by a well-established method—i.e., local application
of lysolecithin (Woodruff and Franklin, 1999) (Figures S4A and
S4B)—compromised conduction of retinocollicular axons and
diminished optomotor performance (Figures S4C–S4E).
4-AP Enhances Eye-Evoked Responses and Optomotor
Performance
The voltage-gated potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine
(4-AP) (Bostock et al., 1981) significantly improves conduction
in de-myelinated axons of patients with multiple sclerosis (Smith
et al., 2000; Hayes, 2004). Consistently, 4-AP improved the func-
tion of lysolecithin-demyelinated RGC axons (Figures S4C–S4E).
We therefore asked whether 4AP could enhance eye-evoked
LFPs in our regeneration model. Remarkably, acute application
of 4-AP to the exposed SC enhanced the amplitude of LFP
response evoked from the eye by an average of 55%, but had
no significant effects on the terminal-evoked LFPs (Figures 4A–
4C). Application of vehicle control had no effect on either eye-
or terminal-evoked LFPs (Figures 4D–4F). Thus, 4-AP improves
conduction of regenerating axons.
Next, we evaluated whether 4-AP treatment could ameliorate
the behavioral visual defect. Control and regeneration-group
mice were tested in the optomotor task before and 3 hr after sys-
temic (intraperitoneal, I.P.) administration of 4-AP (4 mg/kg). The
optomotor acuity of the injured eye was significantly improved in
six of eight regeneration-group mice tested (Figures 4G and 4I).
The effect of 4-AP was transient, as optomotor acuity returned
to baseline by 6 hr after 4-AP administration. Administration of
4-AP had no significantly effect on acuity in control mice (Fig-
ure 4H). In agreement with the behavioral results, subsequent
histological analysis confirmed that six of eight mice in the regen-
eration group but no control mice showed successful axon
regeneration and few regenerated axons were seen in the SC
of the two regeneration-group mice that were non-responsive
to 4-AP treatments (Figures 4G, 4I, and S4F). Thus, axon regen-
eration combined with acute 4-AP treatment enables significant
behavioral recovery.
Behavioral Recovery after Optic Tract Transection in
Adult Mice
In experiments presented above, the optic tract was transected at
P6. To test whether our strategies could also improve function af-
ter injury performed in the adults, we modified our optic tract injury
model. We first aspirated part of the cortex, exposing the optic
tract entering the right SC, and then transected the entire optic
tract. As a result, this surgical procedure led to complete loss of
retinal inputs to the SC as well as the pretectal nuclei and a pro-
found defect in optomotor performance (Figures S5A and S5B).
We performed this optic tract transection in adult PTENf/f/
SOCS3f/f mice that had received intravitreous injection of AAVs-
Cre/CNTF (or AAV-PLAP) at the age of 8 weeks (Figure 5A).
Different from neonatal injury, the majority of injured RGCs sur-
vive after adult optic tract injury, so we did not use the BCL-2
transgenic background in these studies. A second intravitreous
injection of AAV-ChR2-mCherry was performed 1 week after
the optic tract transection. Recovery was assessed �3 months
later by behavioral, physiological, and histological criteria. As in
the juvenile injury model, the combination of intravitreous AAVs-
Cre/CNTF treatment and acute 4-AP administration (4 mg/kg,
I.P.) significantly improved the optomotor acuity of the injured
adult eye without affecting performance of the intact eye (Figures
5B–5D and S5C). Using in vivo extracellular recording, we found
modest eye-evoked LFPs in SC that were significantly increased
after acute 4-AP treatment (Figures 5E–5I and S5C).
Histological examination revealed regenerated ChR2-mCherry-
labeled axonscrossing thelesionand projectingintothe SConlyin
the mice treated with AAVs-Cre/CNTF but not with AAV-PLAP
(Figures 6A–6H). Some regenerating axons also projected aber-
rantly along the lesion site toward the ventral brain area and in a
few cases, others formed vertical columns in the distal SC (Fig-
ure 6G), reminiscent of the termination pattern reported by Cang
and Feldheim (2013). Importantly, there was a correlation between
the extent of axon regeneration and the electrophysiological and
behavioral outcomes in individual animals of the AAVs-Cre/
CNTF-treated group (Figure S5C). Finally, using anti-MAG immu-
nostaining, we again failed to find any evidence of myelination at
and distal to the lesion site (Figures 6I and 6J). Together, these
data indicate that even following adult injury, PTEN and SOCS3
deletion followed by 4-AP treatment led to significant restoration
of visual function.
Functional Improvements Induced by Post-injury
Treatments
Since in humans, treatments would need to be administered
after injury, we asked whether deleting PTEN/SOCS3 after
injury improved visual function. We performed optic tract
transection in adult PTENf/f/SOCS3f/f mice as above and then
injected AAV-Cre and AAV-CNTF intravitreously 2 days later

(A) Schematic diagram showing the experimental timeline. Control group: PTENf/f/SOCS3f/f with AAV-PLAP and regeneration group: PTENf/f/SOCS3f/f with AAVs-
Cre/CNTF. Mice of 8 weeks or older are considered as adults.
(B–D) Optomotor acuities in injured and intact eyes of both groups. 4-AP treatment increased the optomotor acuities of injured eyes only in the regeneration group
but not in control group (B). In the control group, 4-AP did not change the acuities of either injured or intact eyes (C). However, in the regeneration group, 4-AP
increased the optomotor acuities of only injured eyes, but not intact ones (D). n = 10 for control and 8 for regeneration.
(E–H) Representative eye-evoked (E and G) or post-lesion terminal-evoked (F and H) LFPs in control (E and F) or regeneration (G and H) group. Post-behavioral
in vivo recordings showed 4-AP, but not vehicle, significantly increased eye-evoked LFPs in regeneration-group mice. No LFPs were recorded in all control-
injured mice with or without 4-AP.
(I) Ratios of eye-evoked versus paired terminal-evoked LFPs showing the effect of 4-AP or vehicle in regeneration-group mice. n = 7 (out of 8; one failed recording
due to technical reasons). No eye-evoked LFPs were recorded in two of them. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test.

 (Figure S6A). The mice were analyzed behaviorally, physiologi-
cally, and histologically 15–16 weeks after injury. Regeneration
of retinocollicular axons occurred after this delayed treatment
and mice exhibited significant improvement in optomotor
performance if 4-AP was administered before testing (Figures
S6B–S6G).
Another important issue in this protocol is that the achievable
concentration of 4-AP in vivo is two orders of magnitude below
its maximal effective dosage seen in vitro, due to severe side ef-
fects seen in higher concentrations (Blight et al., 1991; Donovan
et al., 2000). Recently, the 4-AP derivative, 4-aminopyridine-3-
methanol (4-AP-3-Me), was found to have higher potency and

 possible lower side effect of impacting electrophysiological
properties (Sun et al., 2010). We found that 4-AP-3-Me, even
at a lower dosage, improved optomotor performance and
increased electrophysiological conduction of regenerated axons
(Figures S6C–S6E) in mice with delayed deletion of PTEN and
SOCS3. Thus, our results suggested that this 4-AP-3-Me might
have a better safety margin than 4-AP for in vivo applications.
Functional Improvement Induced by Combined
Administration of OPN, IGF1, CNTF, and 4-AP
Downregulation of PTEN and SOCS3 could have harmful effects
that would limit their use in enhancing regeneration. In light of our
recent finding that overexpression of the extracellular protein os-
teopontin (OPN) and IGF1 or BDNF promotes optic nerve regen-
eration (Duan et al., 2015), we tested whether this potentially
more translatable approach could also mediate functional recov-
ery. To maximize the number of regenerating axons, we first
analyzed the axon regeneration outcomes after AAV-assisted
combinatorial expression of OPN/IGF1 and CNTF in adult
RGCs after optic nerve injury. As shown in Figures S7A and
S7D, this treatment indeed resulted in significant optic axon
regeneration that was comparable to that seen after PTEN/
SOCS3 deletion plus CNTF treatment after optic nerve injury
(Figure S7B).
We then examined whether OPN/IGF1/CNTF triple treat-
ment, applied after injury, could promote retinocollicular
axon regeneration and mediate functional recovery in a more
challenging version of the optic tract crush model (Figure 7A).
We injured the optic tract at its most anterior part, �2 mm
proximal to the SC (Figure 7E). At 15–16 weeks post-injury,
the mice in different groups were subjected to optomotor
behavioral test, electrophysiological measurements, and histo-
logical analysis. As shown in Figure 7B, the mice with the OPN/
IGF1/CNTF but not vehicle treatment showed improved per-
formance in the optomotor task only in the presence of AP
or 4-AP-3-Me.
Consistent results were also observed for electrical conduc-
tion as measured by electrophysiological recording (Figure 7C).
Furthermore, histological examination showed that the triple
treatments led to robust regeneration of injured retinocollicular
axons (Figures 7D–7G). While some sprouting axons were seen
along the pathway, many regenerated axons grew more than
2 mm prior to entering the SC and then elaborated extensive
sprouting within the SC (Figures 7E–7G). Also similar to that
seen with PTEN/SOCS3 deletion, no co-staining of ChR2 (label-
ing axons) and MAG (labeling myelin) was observed for the OPN/
IGF1/CNTF-induced regenerating axons (Figure 7H). Together,
these results indicated that treatment with OPN/IGF1/CNTF
and 4-AP or 4-AP-3-Me can restore visual function following ax-
otomy in wild-type adult mice.
DISCUSSION
Myelination of Regenerated Axons and Functional
Recovery
We showed here that regenerating RGC axons form functional
synapses following transection in young and adult mice.
However, these synapses fail to restore visual behavior.
In analyzing this failure, we found a profound conduction
blockade associated with the regenerated axons. Previous
studies that induced axon regeneration by combinatorial treat-
ment, including PTEN deletion, report conflicting results with
respect to myelination and visual behavioral recovery (de Lima
et al., 2012; Luo et al., 2013). Thus, with our findings, as well
as prior results showing that regenerated ascending axons
from sensory neurons in the spinal cord are poorly myelinated
(Alto et al., 2009), we propose that the myelination is a limiting
step toward functional recovery after axon regeneration.
The myelination of axons, particularly for long projection
axons, is essential for relaying electrical signals and coordinating
neurons in different locations. This is evident from cases of mul-
tiple sclerosis. For example, despite relative preservation of
axons, many patients with optic neuritis show visual distur-
bances, likely due to inflammation-triggered demyelination
(Toosy et al., 2014). Lack of myelination is similarly disadvanta-
geous for regenerating RGC axons, as they must conduct action
potentials over long distances to retinorecipient areas.
However, it is also important to note that in the intact
adult mice some types of axons are non-myelinated, such as
the brainstem-derived serotonergic axons in the spinal cord.
Indeed, neutralizing inhibitory activities in the environments after
spinal cord injury have been shown to promote the regrowth of
serotonergic axons with subsequent functional recovery (Alilain
et al., 2011; Hellal et al., 2011; Lang et al., 2015; Ruschel et al.,
2015). Similarly, terminals of corticospinal tract (CST) axons
are not myelinated (Zukor et al., 2013), and stimulating sprouting
of CST axons in the gray matter of the spinal cord leads to partial
recovery of forelimb function (Cafferty and Strittmatter, 2006;
Garcı
´a-Alı
´as et al., 2009; Wahl et al., 2014). In contrast, CST
axons are myelinated along most of their length, and normally
myelinated axons more likely need to acquire myelin following
regeneration
to
allow
efficient
conduction
and
functional
recovery.
It remains unclear why regenerated RGC axons fail to re-mye-
linate. This could be due to altered responses in regenerating
axons and/or myelinating cells. Future studies are therefore
needed to elucidate how oligodendrocyte precursors respond
to injury and whether they can be induced to differentiate and
form myelin around regenerated axons (Zuchero and Barres,
2013). Recent studies demonstrating that active myelination is
involved in motor skill learning (Gibson et al., 2014; McKenzie
(D–G) Images and quantification of ChR2-labeled regenerated axons. No axon regenerated was observed in the mice treatment with PLAP (D and G); many axons
seem to retract from the injury site. In contrast, OPN/IGF1/CNTF treatment resulted in long-distance axon regeneration up to 4 mm away from the injury site (E and
G). Some axons sprouted along the pathway (E) and some elaborated extensively within the SC (F). Axons in boxed area in (E) is enlarged in (F). Scale bars, 300 mm
(D); 50 mm (F).
(H) Images showing that ChR2-mCherry-positive regenerated axons are not co-stained with anti-MAG immunoreactivity signal (labeling myelin). Over 200 in-
dividual axonal segments were examined and no co-staining was observed. Scale bars, 10 mm.

229
 et al., 2014), suggest modulating neuronal activity as a means of
promoting myelination.
Visual Functional Recovery Mediated by Regenerated
Axons
We showed that pharmacologically enhancing axonal conduc-
tion allows regenerated axons to mediate significant improve-
ment in an optomotor behavioral task (Prusky et al., 2004). Either
an optic nerve crush or an optic tract transection abolish mice’s
performance in this assay, consistent with the notion that
subcortical visual centers are critical for this performance (Mas-
seck and Hoffmann, 2009; Huberman and Niell, 2011). Because
regenerating axons project not only to SC but also to pretectal
nuclei, we do not know which targets mediate the observed
behavioral recovery.
The incomplete functional recovery we observe might be due
to the small number of regenerating axons or failure of regener-
ated axons to form topographically appropriate connections
within their targets. Based on previous findings that task-specific
training might facilitate the establishment of functional topo-
graphic mapping (Dunlop et al., 2007), it will be interesting to
test whether other accessory rehabilitative training might further
enhance functional recovery.
In this regard, it is important to note that during normal devel-
opment many synapses require both activity-dependent and -in-
dependent processes to mature (Hensch, 2005; Hong and Chen,
2011; Hooks and Chen, 2006; Shah and Crair, 2008; Ackman
and Crair, 2014). It remains to be tested whether RGC activity
is required for the restoration of function during regeneration
and
whether additional
activity
might promote
additional
maturation.
Therapeutic Applications
The observed functional recovery in our models suggests that
strategies for enhancing the intrinsic regenerative ability of
injured axons are useful repair strategies. In addition to genetic
approaches, AAV-assisted overexpression of OPN/IGF1/CNTF
after injury promoted long-distance regeneration of retinal axons
after both optic nerve and optic tract injury models. Because os-
teopontin might act as an extracellular cytokine (Kahles et al.,
2014), it is conceivable that a soluble form of osteopontin,
together with a growth factor, might represent a therapeutic
method of transiently activating regenerative ability in mature
neurons.
Likewise, 4-AP, an FDA-approved potassium channel blocker,
could represent a possibly translatable therapeutic paradigm to
overcome the conduction blockade following damage or dis-
eases. In this aspect, Grijalva et al. (2010) showed that a high
dose of 4-AP treatment resulted in significant functional recovery
in patients of chronic spinal cord injury with cord continuity at
injury site. Although high doses of 4-AP lead to troubling side-ef-
fects (Hayes, 2004), we show that its derivative 4-AP-3-Me
mimics the effects of 4-AP at lower doses, suggesting an alterna-
tive treatment to 4-AP. An alternative approach would be to pro-
mote remyelination, for example by blocking activity of LINGO-1,
a negative regulator of myelination (Mi et al., 2013). This
approach has proven useful in clinical trials for the patients
with optic neuritis, a condition commonly associated with
multiple sclerosis (http://clinicaltrials.gov). Together, these re-
sults encourage testing whether combining treatments for pro-
moting axon regeneration and improving nerve conduction
might be able to achieve functional recovery in clinical settings.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Young SC Injury Model
After a bone flap, a lateral-to-medial cut applied to anesthetized P6 pups to
transect the entire right SC. Then, AAV-Cre or AAV-PLAP was injected intravi-
treously into the left eyes of these pups. One week after SC injury, these mice
received additional intravitreous injection of AAV-CNTF or AAV-PLAP (along
with AAV-ChR2-mCherry in some experiments). In some experiments, cholera
toxin beta subunit (CTB, 1 mg/ml, Invitrogen) was injected intravitreously to
trace the retinocollicular axons.
Adult SC Injury Model
In anesthetized adult mice, a cranial window was created over the right cortex
and cortical/hippocampal tissues were aspirated to reveal the right optic tract
entering the right SC. The entire optic tract was then completely crushed by a
pair of modified forceps. One or two weeks after injury, AAV-ChR2-mCherry
was injected intravitreously into the left eyes for performing ChR2-based elec-
trophysiology as well as axonal tracing.
LFP Recording In Vivo
After surgical exposure of the SC, a glass pipette recording electrode
was then inserted vertically into the exposed SC at least 300 mm caudal
to the lesion. To record terminal-evoked LFPs, an optical fiber with blue
laser (470 nm) was used to illuminate the area with the same constant
output. After the terminal-evoked LFP was recorded, the tip of the optic
fiber was then repositioned to the eye to record the ‘‘paired’’ eye-evoked
LFP.
Whole-Cell Intracellular Recording In Vitro
Parasagittal slices containing the SC were prepared, and recording was per-
formed at room temperature. Picrotoxin (100 mM) was added to the recording
solution to block GABA receptor-mediated responses. Whole-cell patch
clamp recording of synaptic responses was made as described in Hooks
and Chen (2006).
Optomotor Test
Optomotor test was performed by an independent experimenter in a blinded
fashion using a virtual optomotor system (CerebraMechanics). A rotating
grating perceptible to the mouse was projected on a virtual cylinder wall,
and the mouse was allowed to track the grating with reflexive head movements
in concert with the rotation. The highest spatial frequency of the grating
tracked in either direction was recorded as the eye’s acuity.
