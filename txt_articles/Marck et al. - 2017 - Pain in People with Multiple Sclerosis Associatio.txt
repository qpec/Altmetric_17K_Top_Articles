Background: People with multiple sclerosis (MS) often experience pain, which can 
interfere with mobility, employment, and quality of life (QOL).
Methods: This cross-sectional study explored associations between pain, demographic, 
disease, and modifiable lifestyle factors in an international sample of people with MS 
recruited online.
results: Substantial pain, of moderate/severe intensity and interfering at least moderately 
with work/household or enjoyment of life in the past 4 weeks, was reported by 682/2,362 
(28.9%). Substantial pain was associated with fatigue (odds ratio (OR): 6.7, 95% confidence 
interval (CI): 4.9,9.3), depression (OR:4.0, 95% CI:3.2,5.1), anxiety (OR:2.4, 95% CI:1.9,2.9), 
and lower mental health QOL (Mean Difference: −14.7, 95% CI:−16.6,−12.8). Regression 
analyses showed that smoking (OR: 2.0, 95% CI:1.35,2.87) and obesity (OR:2.1, 95% 
CI: 1.5,2.8), moderate alcohol use (OR: 0.7, 95% CI:0.5,0.9), moderate (OR 0.7, 95% CI: 
0.55,0.98) or high (OR 0.6, 95% CI: 0.4,0.8) physical activity level, and healthy diet (OR 0.8, 
95% CI: 0.75,0.95, per 10 points) were associated with substantial pain.
conclusion: Our results show clear associations with modifiable lifestyle factors and sub-
stantial pain in MS. These factors are already considered in the prevention and management 
of pain in other populations but have not previously been considered in MS. Conversely, pain 
and associated common MS comorbidities, such as depression, anxiety, and fatigue, may 
hamper efforts to start or maintain healthy behaviors. Strategies to overcome these barriers 
need to be considered. Further research should clarify the direction of these associations.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disorder with variable disease course and diverse symp-
tomatology. Demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS) causes symptoms such as fatigue, 
weakness and impairment in mobility, sensation, and vision.

Pain and Associated Factors in MS
Frontiers in Neurology | www.frontiersin.org

Pain, including headaches, lower back pain, neuropathic pain 
and painful spasms, is a common symptom in people with MS 
(PwMS), with a wide prevalence range between 30 and 85% 
(1–4). In the general population, prevalence estimates of 20–30% 
are commonly reported (5, 6), although prevalence estimates 
from older populations report up to 72% (7). However, defini-
tions and sample characteristics vary between studies, making 
it difficult to directly compare prevalence and severity of pain. 
One case–control study in PwMS found a similar prevalence of 
pain to controls [Odds Ratio (OR) 0.99–1.13], but showed that 
PwMS had more severe pain than controls, comparable to people 
with arthritis (8). Another study showed that both pain severity 
and interference was greater in PwMS than controls, but these 
differences were only significant in some, mostly older age groups 
(9). PwMS more often require pharmacological treatment (10) 
and pain can significantly interfere with daily activities (11) and 
employment (12) and affect quality of life (QOL) (13–15).
Damage in the central or peripheral nervous system, inflam-
matory, and musculoskeletal mechanisms, such as immobilization 
of parts of the body, may all contribute to pain (4, 16). Exogenous 
contributors include MS drugs, such as interferon beta, dimethyl-
fumarate and long-term steroid treatment (4, 17), although no 
associations between MS drugs and pain, were found in a large 
North American study (14).
In MS, pain seems to be part of a complex interplay between 
other common symptoms or comorbidities, such as fatigue, 
anxiety, and depression (18, 19), although at least one study 
suggests the associations between anxiety, depression, and pain 
is present only in women (10). Bio-psycho-social models, rec-
ognizing psychological and environmental factors, have recently 
been proposed to disentangle the causal pathway between these 
factors. Different outcome measures have been assessed using 
comprehensive models, including a recent study showing that 
pain affects participation in life through fatigue and physical 
functioning (20). Modifiable lifestyle factors associated with MS 
onset and progression, such as vitamin D, smoking, stress, diet, 
physical activity, and body mass index (BMI) (21), have, however, 
not been studied in relation to pain to great extent.
Our study aimed to determine the associations between sub-
stantial pain and modifiable lifestyle factors and to explore the 
relationship between substantial pain, depression, anxiety, and 
fatigue in a large international sample of PwMS.
MaTerials anD MeThODs
Participants and Data collection
The methodology of the Health Outcomes and Lifestyle In a 
Sample of people with Multiple sclerosis study has previously 
been described (22). Participants over 18 years who reported a 
diagnosis of MS by a medical doctor were recruited via online plat-
forms, including social media, websites, and forums that engaged 
PwMS, most of which had a health and lifestyle focus in 2012. 
Participants reporting a possible diagnosis of MS or Clinically 
Isolated Syndrome were not included in this analysis. The web-
based tool, SurveyMonkey®, was used to collect responses. As the 
survey was in English only, non-English speaking participants 
were not included.
ethics, consent, and Permissions
The Health Sciences Human Ethics Sub-Committee at the 
University of Melbourne provided ethical approval for the 
study (Ethics ID: 1545102). Individuals were provided with 
participant information and could not enter the survey until 
they confirmed they were 18 years or older and consented to 
participate.
Data collected and Tools Used
The online survey collected data in 2012, used validated tools 
where possible, and took approximately 40 min to complete. 
Specific to this study were items exploring demographic 
variables, morbidity indicators, and modifiable lifestyle factors. 
Demographic factors were collected using researcher-devised 
items and included age and gender.
substantial Pain
Items regarding pain were part of the Multiple Sclerosis Quality Of 
Life (MSQOL-54) instrument and included three items regarding 
intensity of pain; interference of pain with work or household 
activities; and interference with enjoyment of life. Almost a quar-
ter (24.7%) reported no pain in the 4 weeks prior to survey, while 
44.3% reported no interference with normal work or household 
activities and 43.7% reported no interference with enjoyment of 
life (see Table S1 in Supplementary Material). As our aim was 
to assess substantial pain, we defined this as having moderate, 
severe, or very severe pain, which interfered moderately, quite a 
bit or extremely with normal work/household activities and/or 
enjoyment of life in the past 4 weeks. Substantial pain was expe-
rienced by 682 participants (28.9%). The results section describes 
the characteristics of the sample with sufficient data to determine 
the prevalence of substantial pain.
Morbidity indicators
Mental health-related QOL was also assessed by the widely used 
MSQOL-54, giving rise to the mental health QOL scores, as well 
as several other scales not included in these analyses. Level of 
gait disability was assessed using the Patient Determined Disease 
Steps, a validated self-reported surrogate tool to the Expanded 
Disability Status Scale, with ordinal scores from 0 (no disability) to 
8 (bed-bound). Researcher-devised items assessed self-reported 
doctor-diagnosed relapse rate over the previous 12 months, type 
of MS currently diagnosed, and years since diagnosis. The Patient 
Health Questionnaire depression module short version (PHQ-
2) was used to screen for depression risk; a score of 3 or more 
indicated a positive screen for depression. The fatigue severity 
scale, with a cutoff of 4 or more, was used as an indicator of 
clinically significant fatigue. A researcher-devised item assessed 
current anxiety. A list of 24 disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) was 
provided and participants were categorized as either currently 
using a DMD or not.
Modifiable lifestyle Factors
Height and weight information allowed calculation of BMI accord-
ing to the World Health Organization criteria (<20 = underweight, 
20–25 = normal weight, 25–30 = overweight, and >30 = obese). 
Dietary habits were assessed with the modified Dietary Habits

Questionnaire on a scale of 0–100. The International Physical 
Activity Questionnaire was included to assess level of regular 
physical activity (low, moderate, and high). Omega-3 and vitamin 
D supplementation (yes/no), meditation practice (never, ≤once a 
week, >once a week), level of alcohol consumption [low (<15 g/
week), moderate/high (<15 g/week)], and current smoking status 
(current/previous/never) were assessed using researcher-devised 
items. All data were self-reported.
statistical analysis
Categorical data are presented as percentages with frequency. 
Continuous data are presented as mean and SD, and skewed data 
are presented as median with interquartile range (25th–75th per-
centile). We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression 
models to investigate the associations between substantial pain 
and a range of modifiable lifestyle factors adjusting for confound-
ers identified a priori based on our subject-matter knowledge (18, 
20). This model included all modifiable lifestyle variables and age, 
gender, years since diagnosis, and level of disability. In addition, 
we explored the associations between pain and fatigue, depres-
sion, anxiety, and mental health QOL using separate multivariable 
logistic regression models, each adjusted for confounders age, 
gender, disease duration and type of MS. Data were analyzed 
using Stata, V12 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) and R (R 
Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
resUlTs
The sample characteristics of the 2,362 participants who com-
pleted data items for the substantial pain variable are shown in 
Table 1, with a full list of country of residence available in a pre-
vious publication (22). Unadjusted univariable analysis showed 
that several socio-demographic variables (Table 1), and health 
outcomes (Table 2) were associated with substantial pain.
In addition, we explored the association between several 
modifiable lifestyle factors as exposures and substantial pain 
as the outcome in a multivariable regression model adjusted 
for age, gender, duration of MS and level of disability. Table S2 
in Supplementary Material shows the lifestyle factors for the 
sample. Participants who smoked (compared with those who 
never smoked) or were obese (compared with those with normal 
BMI) were twice as likely to report substantial pain. Those with 
moderate or high alcohol use (compared with low) and those with 
moderate levels of physical activity (compared with low) were 
1.4–1.5 times less likely to report substantial pain, while those 
reporting high physical activity were 1.7 times less likely to report 
substantial pain; every 10 point increase in healthy diet score was 
associated with 1.2 times lower odds of substantial pain (Table 3).
DiscUssiOn
Pain is common in PwMS and contributes significantly to disabil-
ity (11, 12) and worse QOL (13, 14). Our results showed that those 
with substantial pain were more likely to be diagnosed longer ago 
and had a higher level of disability and more relapses. Most studies 
report associations between the likelihood of experiencing pain 
and pain intensity with longer disease duration, more progressive 
forms of MS and level of disability (14, 23, 24), while some do 
not (3, 25, 26). Inconsistent findings of associations between pain 
and relapses have also been reported, with some showing asso-
ciations of pain with higher relapse rate (23), while others report

Pain and Associated Factors in MS

increased relapses associated with lower prevalence of pain (26). 
In univariable analyses, we found a reduced risk of pain in people 
with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS), older age and female gender, 
in line with others (14). Age, gender and years since diagnosis 
were, however, no longer significantly associated with substantial 
pain in a multivariable regression adjusting for modifiable lifestyle 
factors, while disability level was still strongly related to pain.
Reduced mental health QOL, fatigue, depression, and anxiety 
had substantial adjusted associations with substantial pain, in line 
with previous literature (2, 15, 18, 20, 27). Pain is a multi-factorial 
symptom, with clear physical correlation in PwMS with CNS 
demyelination and degeneration (28), but also contributed to by 
psycho-social factors such as personality, depression, anxiety, and 
comorbid conditions, such as fatigue (18). The interplay between 
these factors determines the perception of pain. The presence of 
pain in its own right may, however, also lead to some of these 
comorbidities, as may poorer lifestyle behaviors, which in turn 
may be maintained due to the presence of pain (e.g., physical 
inactivity, and smoking).
Our study identified important associations between the expe-
rience of substantial pain and modifiable lifestyle risk factors. 
Current smokers were twice as likely to report substantial pain in 
our study, in line with other studies (29). Another study showed 
that current smoking increased the likelihood of pain in those 
reporting depression (30). The association between smoking and 
pain has been summarized as a positive feedback loop where 
smoking may be a risk factor for pain, while pain is a powerful 
motivator to continue smoking due to anti-nociceptive effects 
(31). This feedback loop may be especially hard to break for peo-
ple experiencing depression or anxiety who may have increased 
pain sensitivity and negative affect when attempting smoking 
cessation (32). Clinicians should be aware of this interplay when 
managing MS symptoms. Promoting smoking cessation as part of 
a secondary and tertiary management strategy is, however, vital 
since smoking has been shown to play a significant role in disease 
progression (33), although this may be more difficult in people 
experiencing pain or depression.
Similarly, we showed a significant association between more 
physical activity and lower odds of experiencing substantial pain, 
in line with previous literature (34). While people may be less 
likely to engage in physical activity due to pain, there may well 
be a role for physical activity in pain management in PwMS (35). 
Physical activity is known to increase pain threshold and tolerance 
(36). In a study of older adults, those with chronic pain had lower 
levels of physical activity, and fear-avoidance believes played an 
important role in predicting future physical activity levels, over 
pain characteristics (37). Others have shown that psycho-social 
factors, including negative beliefs about pain and avoidance of 
activity are likely to influence pain severity and interference (38). 
Promoting physical activity among PwMS is of importance given 
the wide-ranging benefits of exercise in potentially modifying the 
course of the disease (39) and reducing fatigue and depression 
(40–42); however, consideration of psycho-social barriers to 
increasing physical activity is essential.
Poorer diet and obesity were associated with higher odds 
for substantial pain in our study. Little is published about this 
association in humans but there is some evidence from animal 
studies that a high-fat diet can contribute to pain (43, 44), and it is 
plausible that poor diet contributes to systemic inflammation and 
increased pain sensitivity (45). Poor diet may lead to becoming 
overweight or obese which in itself is associated with increased 
likelihood of pain (30, 46). Weight loss can improve pain symptoms 
(47, 48), although pain can also be a barrier to weight loss (49). 
A population-based cohort study showed that being overweight 
or obese was associated with reporting future pain, while pain 
increased the odds for future obesity, with smoking confounding 
this relationship (19). As with diet, chronic inflammation is likely 
implicated in this interplay between physical activity, weight, and 
pain (50). Obesity has become a focus in secondary prevention 
in MS, with clear associations with poorer health outcomes (51). 
Our findings suggest that moderate alcohol use need not be con-
sidered negative for PwMS, in line with previous research (52).

Pain and Associated Factors in MS

Based on our data, it is unclear whether these modifiable 
lifestyle factors directly contribute to development of substantial 
pain in MS, or indirectly through fatigue, anxiety, and/or depres-
sion; or whether pain is contributing to fatigue, depression and 
poorer lifestyle behaviors. Future studies could further investigate 
these associations by attempting to clarify temporality through 
longitudinal data, and investigation mediating and moderating 
factors involved. Future studies should also record the type 
and potentially the cause of pain, to further understand the 
underlying mechanism.
Depression, smoking, physical activity, and being overweight 
have previously been reported as modifiable risk factors to be 
considered in the prevention and management of pain in other 
populations (30, 53). It is likely that a comprehensive secondary 
and tertiary prevention strategy for pain (and health outcomes 
in general) in PwMS would include advice about lifestyle fac-
tors such as diet, weight, physical activity, and smoking (21). 
Rehabilitation services often address lifestyle factors that can 
minimize the impact of pain in PwMS (54). However, pain, 
psycho-social factors, and common symptoms or comorbidities 
such as depression, anxiety, and fatigue, may hamper efforts 
to take up or maintain healthy behaviors. Holistic strategies to 
overcome these barriers and break the feedback loop need to be 
considered.
strengths and limitations
To our knowledge, this is the first study to report on a range of 
modifiable lifestyle factors in relation to MS-associated pain. 
This study is international in scope with a large sample size, 
using multivariable regression, including a wide range of relevant 
variables. However, sleep disturbance, previously indicated in 
the relation between depression and pain, was not measured in 
our sample (18). We also did not record the type of pain medi-
cation (other than whether they were prescription or over the 
counter pain medication) or the location of pain. All data were 
self-reported and, although previously validated tools were used 
where possible, were unable to be verified. Substantial pain was 
determined by categorizing participants in two groups depending 
on their responses to items on the pain scale of the MSQOL-54; 
this method has not previously been used or validated, but does 
allow for future studies to directly compare data with ours. High 
alcohol use was very rare among our participants and they were 
grouped with moderate alcohol users. Due to participation bias, 
this sample may not be generalizable to all PwMS, despite the 
variety of backgrounds of participants and size of the sample. 
Finally, our study is cross-sectional; therefore, we cannot assume 
causal or temporal relationships. The assessment of the complex 
interplay between the variables (e.g., the direct and indirect con-
tribution of the factors described here to substantial pain) was 
beyond the scope of this paper. We used complete case analysis, 
restricted to available data. Table S3 in Supplementary Material 
summarizes the distribution of the variables of the data used and 
not used in the analysis presented in Table 3, indicating that the 
difference between the two datasets is minimal.
cOnclUsiOn
Pain is common in PwMS, with substantial pain present in over 
a quarter of our study population. Fatigue, depression, reduced 
mental health QOL, and anxiety were strongly associated with 
the presence of substantial pain. For the first time, we showed 
that tobacco smoking, obesity, lack of exercise, and poor diet 
were also associated with pain using multivariable analyses. These 
modifiable factors have previously been suggested to be targets for 
management of pain in other populations and in the secondary 
prevention of MS. Further research is needed to disentangle the 
complex interplay between these lifestyle factors, symptoms, and 
comorbidities, which may contribute to pain, or may be caused 
or maintained by the presence of pain.
