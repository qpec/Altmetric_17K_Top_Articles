PRACTICE GUIDELINES
 
 
 
Stool testing for occult blood has long been recommended for 
colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in healthy adults ( 
1 
). Th
 is rec-
ommendation is based on randomized controlled trials showing 
short-term ( 
2–4 
) and long-term ( 
5,6 
) reductions in CRC inci-
dence and mortality. Th
 ese studies relied on the guaiac test as an 
indirect mechanism to detect blood in the stool. Such tests do not 
examine the stool for human hemoglobin, but rather are predi-
cated on colorimetric detection of peroxidase activity. Specifi
 cally, 
human hemoglobin is a peroxidase catalyst when hydrogen per-
oxide is added to a guaiac-impregnated card. Unfortunately, many 
foods contain nonhemoglobin peroxidase activity, which con-
founds this test. Although guaiac-based CRC screening works, 
several factors limit its value ( 
7 
), as discussed later.
 
Fecal immunochemical tests (FITs) for CRC screening were 
developed as a direct measure of human hemoglobin in stool, 
using monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies against the globin moi-
ety of human hemoglobin ( 
8,9 
). Most FITs are qualitative tests that 
visually indicate when hemoglobin is detected in the sample that 
is higher than a specifi
 c predetermined threshold. A few FITs are 
quantitative tests, whereby the amount of hemoglobin is measured 
numerically and then reported as positive if greater than a pre-
specifi
 ed threshold. Although long-term, large, programmatic tri-
als with FIT have not been completed yet, prospective data support 
the eff
 ectiveness of FIT as a screening tool, including some evi-
dence that programmatic testing reduces CRC mortality ( 
10–12 
).
 
 
Although colonoscopy remains central to US-based CRC 
screening eff
 orts ( 
13 
), to maximize compliance, eff
 ective commu-
nity-based screening requires the availability of multiple screening 
modalities. FIT now is recognized as an important component of 
any CRC screening program.
 
Th
 is review has multiple purposes. First, to assist health care 
practitioners in the use of FIT, evidence is summarized about 
performance characteristics and the comparative eff
 ectiveness 
of FIT. Second, to assist practices or organizations developing

The use of the fecal occult blood test (FOBT) for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is supported by randomized 
trials demonstrating effectiveness in cancer prevention and widely recommended by guidelines for this purpose. The 
fecal immunochemical test (FIT), as a direct measure of human hemoglobin in stool has a number of advantages 
relative to conventional FOBT and is increasingly used relative to that test. This review summarizes current evidence 
for FIT in colorectal neoplasia detection and the comparative effectiveness of FIT relative to other commonly used 
CRC screening modalities. Based on evidence, guidance statements on FIT application were developed and quality 
metrics for program implementation proposed.

FIT-based screening programs, evidence is summarized regard-
ing its application (e.g., number of tests and quantitative cut-off
  
values for a positive test). Finally, additional sections of the review 
address important clinical questions regarding FIT. When possi-
ble, recommendations were made using the Grading of Recom-
mendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) 
approach ( 
14 
).
 
METHODS
 
Literature review
 
Th
 e committee relied on 2 previous systematic reviews of the 
FIT. Th
 e fi
 rst was developed for the US Preventive Services Task 
Force ( 
15 
), and the second addressed the sensitivity of FIT for 
CRC ( 
16 
). To update this review, a search strategy similar to that 
used for the more recent review ( 
16 
) was used to identify high-
quality reports published since August 2013 through September 
30, 2015. Th
 e updated review used the MEDLINE (Ovid) and 
Cochrane Database Search strategy as outlined by Lee  
et al. ( 
16 
) 
in their 2014 publication. In addition, 2 authors (D.J.R. and J.K.L.) 
conducted specifi
 c literature searches to identify relevant reports 
for topics not directly dealing with the test characteristics of FIT 
and colorectal neoplasia detection. Th
 ese identifi
 ed reports then 
were reviewed and their citations were examined for further 
works informing the key study questions answered in the docu-
ment. Although the literature search for the report was broad, 
the document was designed primarily to address US practice and 
focused on tests currently approved for use in the United States 
( 
Supplementary Table 1 online 
).
 
Defi
 nitions
 
When reporting quantitative hemoglobin measurements, we have 
followed recommendations by an expert panel and report the 
results or thresholds as micrograms of hemoglobin per gram of 
feces ( 
17 
). When needed, conversions from reports using nano-
grams of hemoglobin per milliliter of buff
 er were converted with 
the following formula: μ 
g hemoglobin per g feces=(ng hemo-
globin per mL x mL buff
 er)/(mg feces collected).
 
Process and levels of evidence
 
Th
 e United States Multi-Society Task Force (USMSTF) is com-
posed of gastroenterologists with focused interest in colorectal 
cancer representing the American College of Gastroenterology, 
the American Gastroenterological Association, and the American 
Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. Aft
 er the literature review, 
draft
  tables and the manuscript were completed and circulated 
to Task Force members. Guidance statements were developed 
through consensus obtained through multiple joint teleconfer-
ences. Once the fi
 nal manuscript was complete, it was submitted 
for review and approval by all 3 gastroenterology societies.
 
Th
 e use of GRADE for USMSTF guidance reports has been out-
lined in detail elsewhere ( 
18 
). GRADE involves a comprehensive 
literature search and summary (oft
 en through meta-analysis), and 
then a separate review of literature quality and the development 
of recommendations. Th
 e USMSTF uses a modifi
 ed qualitative 
approach based on literature review (as described earlier for this 
report), but without formal meta-analysis. GRADE allows for a 
separate assessment of the quality of the evidence and strength of 
recommendation. Th
 is approach explicitly recognizes the impor-
tance of literature in informing clinical recommendations, but 
allows latitude because recommendations may be infl
 uenced by 
other factors, such as patient preference and cost. Strong recom-
mendations are those that would be chosen by most informed 
patients. Weak recommendations are those in which patient values 
and preferences might play a larger role than the quality of evi-
dence. Within the document, we preface weak recommendations 
with phrases such as "we suggest," and strong recommendations 
with "we recommend."
 
EVIDENCE SUMMARY REGARDING FIT 
PERFORMANCE
 
Test characteristics for FIT when applied one time and pro-
grammatically
 
How sensitive and specifi
 c is FIT-based screening for CRC and 
advanced neoplasia with one-time application? 
 
  
Several cohort 
and cross-sectional studies analyzed the single-application test 
characteristics of FIT for CRC detection with or without a 
comparative guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT), us-
ing colonoscopy or at least 2 years of follow-up evaluation as the 
reference standard ( 
19–38 
) ( 
Table 1 
). In a meta-analysis of 19 
studies in asymptomatic average-risk adults the pooled sensitivity of 
FIT was 79% (95% confi
 dence interval [CI], 0.69–0.86) for CRC, 
with a specifi
 city of 94% (95% CI, 0.92–0.95) ( 
16 
). Subgroup 
analysis that was restricted to studies in which only colonoscopy 
(and not clinical follow-up evaluation) was the reference standard 
found an overall sensitivity and specifi
 city of 1-time FIT screening 
for CRC of 77 and 94%, respectively. A very large and recent US 
study completed aft
 er the meta-analysis examined the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared OC FIT CHEK (Polymedco, 
Cortlandt Manor, NY) in 9,989 individuals undergoing colonos-
copy. Th
 e reported sensitivity and specifi
 city for cancer was 74 
and 96%, respectively ( 
37 
).
 
 
Few studies compare FIT test characteristics of various brands 
with one another using cancer as the outcome. In the single com-
parative eff
 ectiveness study ( 
21 
) of 2 FIT brands included in the 
meta-analysis ( 
16 
), the FDA approved OC-Sensor (Eiken Chemical 
Co, Tokyo, Japan) FIT had a higher sensitivity for CRC compared 
with the RIDASCREEN (R-Biopharm AG, Darmstadt, Germany) 
FIT (73.3 vs. 60.0%, respectively), with similar specifi
 cities (95%).
 
Importantly, the sensitivity of quantitative FIT assays can be 
adjusted by altering the threshold for a positive result. In the prior 
study, the OC-Sensor cut-off
  value was 6.1 μ 
g/g vs. a RIDAS-
CREEN cut-off
  value of 24.5 μ 
g/g. Presumably, the sensitivity 
of the latter test could be improved by reducing the threshold, 
although this would impact specifi
 city negatively.
 
 
More recently, investigators using data from the Taiwanese 
national CRC screening program directly compared 2 FIT tests 
(OC-Sensor and HM-Jack [Kyowa Medex Co, Tokyo, Japan]) using 
the same threshold cut-off
  concentration used programmatically in

available in the United States) ( 
42 
). By using colonoscopy as the 
gold standard, the sensitivities for advanced adenoma ranged from 
25 to 56%, with specifi
 cities from 68 to 96% in 1,319 average-risk 
subjects.
 
Varying cut-off
  levels to defi
 ne a positive test result also aff
 ects 
FIT sensitivity and specifi
 city for advanced adenomas. In a study 
of 1,256 asymptomatic, average-risk Dutch subjects, the sensitiv-
ity of a 1-sample OC-Sensor FIT for advanced adenoma increased 
from 29 to 35%, with a corresponding decrease in specifi
 city from 
97 to 93% by decreasing the hemoglobin cut-off
  value from 20 to 
10 μ 
g/g ( 
25 
). Decreasing the cut-off
  value from 14 to 2 μ 
g/g also 
increased the sensitivity of a one-sample RIDASCREEN FIT for 
advanced adenomas from 23.9 to 40.0%, with a corresponding 
decrease in specifi
 city from 97.4 to 89.6% in 1,319 asymptomatic, 
average-risk German subjects ( 
41 
).
 
Th
 e positive predictive value (PPV) of 1-time FIT for the detec-
tion of cancer and advanced adenoma has been determined across 
a range of populations ( 
Table 3 
). Th
 e PPV is a function of both the 
inherent sensitivity of the test and disease prevalence in the popu-
lation studied. Th
 e PPV of FIT for cancer ranged from 2.9 to 7.8% 
that country (20 μ 
g hemoglobin [hgb]/g feces). Th
 e OC-Sensor test 
had superior sensitivity for cancer relative to HM-Jack (80 vs. 68%; 
P=0.005), although no mortality benefi
 t was observed over the 
5-year study period ( 
11 
). A separate study compared 2 brands of 
FIT in a screening program in the Basque Autonomous Region 
in Spain ( 
39 
). Either OC-Sensor (20 μ 
g hgb/g feces) or FOB Gold 
(Sentinel Diagnostics SpA, Milan, Italy) (20 μ 
g hgb/g feces) was 
off
 ered (varied by region) to nearly 38,000 individuals. Th
 e par-
ticipation rate was slightly higher with OC-Sensor (61.8 vs. 59.1%; 
P=0.008), but there was no signifi
 cant diff
 erence in cancer detec-
tion among those who underwent colonoscopy for evaluation of a 
positive test (5.1% OC-Sensor vs. 4.8% FOB Gold).
 
Reports of a single-application, 1-sample FIT showed sensitivity 
for advanced adenoma (defi
 ned as any adenoma >10 mm or with 
villous or high-grade dysplastic features) but varied from 6 to 56% 
in the screening population ( 
21,24,25,29,30,33,34,36–38,40–42 
) 
( 
Table 2 
). Th
 is variation was owing to the diff
 erent FIT brands 
used and the diff
 erent cut-off
  values used to defi
 ne a positive 
test. Th
 is was best shown in a German study comparing 5 diff
 er-
ent qualitative FIT brands (none of which were FDA approved or

and for advanced neoplasia ranged from 33.9 to 54%. A positive 
FIT result signifi
 cantly increased the yield of colonoscopy for these 
important outcomes relative to a screening colonoscopy, in which 
cancer (0.5–l%) and advanced neoplasia (5–10%) are detected 
much less frequently ( 
43,44 
).
 
How do FIT participation and performance characteristics for 
neoplasia detection change over multiple rounds of applica-
tion? 
 
  
Available data indicate that FIT participation rates tend 
to remain stable through multiple rounds of screening ( 
45–52 
). 
For example, aft
 er 3 rounds of programmatic screening in Th
 e 
Netherlands, participation among those eligible to be screened 
remained greater than 60% ( 
47 
). Aft
 er 4 rounds of a biennial 
screening program in Italy, 1,862 individuals received all 4 in-
vitations to be screened. Considering those individuals, 78% 
had attended at least once and 38% completed the FIT on all 4 
occasions ( 
45 
). In a large annual FIT-based screening program 
at Kaiser Permanente Northern and Southern California, of the 
670,841 individuals initially mailed a kit, 48% responded. Th
 ose 
initial responders who subsequently were eligible for screening 
and sent a kit continued to participate in the range of 75–86% 
over the following 3 rounds ( 
52 
).
 
Similar to screening with gFOBT, the positivity rate, subse-
quent demand for colonoscopy, detection rate, and PPV for CRC 
decreased with successive rounds of screening with FIT ( 
45–52 
) 
( 
Table 3 
). However, the detection rate and PPV for advanced 
neoplasia (i.e., the combined outcome of cancer and advanced 
adenomas) remained higher with repeated FIT than with repeated 
gFOBT ( 
46 
). Th
 e decrease in positivity rates appeared to be owing 
to detection and removal of prevalent CRC and advanced adeno-
mas in the fi
 rst year, and the gradual culling of bleeding neoplasms. 
For example, in the study with the longest follow-up period ( 
45 
), no 
cancers were detected in the fi
 nal (i.e., fourth) screening round of 
this biennial FIT program. However, the PPV of FIT for advanced 
neoplasia remained high (i.e., 30–40%) throughout the 4 rounds of 
screening ( 
Table 3 
).
 
Recommendation/Summary
 
With 1-time application, FIT tests are approximately 80% sensi-
tive for cancer detection and approximately 20–30% sensitive for 
advanced neoplasia detection. To enhance advanced adenoma 
detection, repeated applications of FIT are required. Th
 erefore, 
we recommend repeated testing (see later for details) to maximize 
the eff
 ectiveness of cancer detection and prevention with this 
modality. Individuals choosing FIT should understand the need 
for recurring testing and for colonoscopy to evaluate a positive 
FIT result. Programs to track cycles of testing are encouraged to 
facilitate completion.  
Strong recommendation; moderate-qual-
ity evidence. 
 
Given the high positive predictive value of FIT for cancer detec-
tion, colonoscopy is recommended when the test is positive, not 
repeat FIT.  
Strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence.

Although the comparison studies used FITs with varying posi-
tivity rates, a recent German study showed that when the threshold 
level for a positive FIT was adjusted so that the positivity rates were 
similar for FIT (OC-Sensor) and gFOBT (HemOccult, Beckman 
Coulter, Krefeld, Germany), the sensitivity of FIT for CRC was 2 
times higher than gFOBT (FIT sensitivity, 73.3%; gFOBT sensitiv-
ity, 33.3%), with similar specifi
 cities (>95%) ( 
21 
). Similarly, in a 
French cancer screening program, 1-sample OC-Sensor (30 μ 
g/g 
cut-off
 ) had a true-positive detection rate for advanced neoplasia 
that was nearly twice that of Hemoccult II (9.7 vs. 4.2%) at the 
same false-positive rate ( 
60 
).
 
In addition, participation is greater when individuals are off
 ered 
FIT vs. gFOBT. At least 4 RCTs showed improved adherence (an 
approximately 10% absolute increase), contributing to improved 
detection ( 
53,55,58,61 
). Adherence to screening with FIT vs. 
gFOBT was summarized in 2 meta-analyses ( 
59,62 
) and a separate 
 
COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF FIT-BASED 
SCREENING RELATIVE TO OTHER SCREENING 
MODALITIES
 
gFOBT vs. FIT
 
Studies using diff
 erent designs (e.g., randomized controlled trial 
[RCT], cross-sectional) have compared gFOBT and FIT for 
the detection of neoplasia in screening populations ( 
Table 4 
) 
( 
19–21,28,33,35,53–58 
). Signifi
 cant variation exists across studies 
with the specifi
 c brands used (both gFOBT and FIT) and outcomes 
examined. Studies have indicated that FIT is superior to gFOBT 
in sensitivity for detecting CRC and advanced neoplasia, with 
comparable or only slightly reduced specifi
 city ( 
19,21,33,35,54 
). 
A recently completed meta-analysis suggested that FIT was supe-
rior to gFOBT both for the detection of cancer (relative risk [RR], 
1.96; 95% CI, 1.2–3.2) and advanced neoplasia (RR, 2.28; 95% CI, 
1.68–3.10) ( 
59 
).

In that study, individuals were invited to either a screening co-
lonoscopy ( 
n 
=26,703) or biennial FIT ( 
n 
=26,599) using the OC-
Sensor device at a 15 μ

in the FIT arm (34.2 vs. 24.6%), with no diff

randomized to colonoscopy (1.9 vs. 0.9%). Per-protocol analysis 
showed a trend toward improved cancer detection in individuals 
screened with colonoscopy relative to 1-time FIT (OR, 1.56; 95% 
CI, 0.93–2.56; P=0.09). Because those in the FIT arm will con-
tinue to be screened biennially, additional cancers and adenomas 
will be detected. Th
 us, the long-term comparative eff
 ectiveness 
remains to be determined.
 
Other studies have compared FIT with colonoscopy ( 
Table 6 
) 
( 
40,66,72 
). Most recently, Gupta  
et al 
. ( 
72 
) examined the participa-
tion and yield of no-cost FIT vs. no-cost screening colonoscopy 
when inviting an uninsured US population that was not up to date 
with screening. Similar to the ColonPrev study, participation was 
higher with FIT (40.7 vs. 24.6%) and no diff
 erence was observed 
in cancer detection between the 2 groups (0.4 vs. 0.4%). Advanced 
neoplasia detection was superior with colonoscopy (1.3%) relative 
to a single application of FIT screening (0.8%).
 
Summary: Comparative effectiveness
 
Adherence to FIT is superior to 3-card gFOBT and superior to 
colonoscopy in a non-US population and in an uninsured US 
population. FIT outperforms gFOBT in the detection of advanced 
neoplasia, and endoscopic strategies are superior to 1-time FIT for 
that outcome. A recent metaanalysis of studies largely performed 
outside the United States quantifi
 ed many of these comparisons 
( 
59 
). In that review, endoscopic strategies were associated with 
lower participation rates compared with FIT (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 
0.56–0.80), but there was a signifi
 cantly higher advanced neopla-
sia detection rate (RR, 3.21; 95% CI, 2.38–4.32). FIT was superior 
to gFOBT both using the outcome of adherence (RR, 1.16; 95% 
CI, 1.03–1.30) and the detection of advanced neoplasia (RR, 2.28; 
95% CI, 1.68–3.10).
 
Th
 ese trials do not generally test a commonly used approach of 
off
 ering screening in the United States called sequential testing. 
In the United States, most screening is opportunistic rather than 
programmatic. Clinicians oft
 en start the discussion of screening 
with an off
 er of colonoscopy, which is or should be followed by 
an off
 er of FIT if colonoscopy is declined. Th
 e process of off
 ering 
1 test (usually the test viewed as the most eff
 ective) and off
 ering 
a second test to persons who decline the fi
 rst is called sequential 
testing. Sequential testing beginning with sigmoidoscopy followed 
by fecal blood testing for persons declining sigmoidoscopy has 
resulted in improved participation rates ranging from 19 to 25% 
in 2 studies examining this approach ( 
73,74 
). Both studies showed 
enhanced advanced neoplasia detection including an increase in 
cancer detection of approximately 20%.
 
Recommendation/Summary
 
When comparing FIT with gFOBT, FIT has improved sensitivity 
for CRC and advanced colorectal neoplasia detection at similar 
review ( 
63 
). Both meta-analyses found participation to be approxi-
mately 20% greater for those off
 ered FIT compared with gFOBT. 
Better adherence appears driven by simplifying the sampling 
method (fewer samples needed for FIT completion [usually 1 or 2 
tests] compared with gFOBT [3 tests]), and removing the need for 
dietary and medication restriction with FIT (for more details on 
diet and medication, see later).
 
Stool DNA vs. FIT 
 
. 
  
Stool DNA testing for colorectal cancer 
screening is predicated on the detection of DNA from shed neo-
plastic cells into the lumen of the bowel with subsequent detection 
of mutant or epigenetically altered DNA markers. Over the past 
decade, buff
 ers have been added to stabilize the DNA fragments 
and better markers have been chosen for the assay ( 
64 
). Th
 e most 
recent generation of the stool DNA test was compared directly 
with FIT (OC FIT-CHEK; Polymedco; 20 μ 
g/g cut-off
  value) in 
approximately 10,000 asymptomatic individuals undergoing co-
lonoscopy ( 
37 
). Th
 e multitarget stool DNA test now includes an 
immunochemical assay for human hemoglobin in addition to 
testing for DNA markers (methylated BMP3 and NDRG4 pro-
moter regions, mutant KRAS, and  
β 
-actin). With 1-time testing, 
sensitivity for CRC was better with the multitarget stool DNA test 
(which essentially includes a FIT) relative to FIT alone both for 
cancer (92.3 vs. 73.8%) and advanced lesions (42.4 vs. 23.8%), 
but specifi
 city was lower (86.6 vs. 94.9%). Unlike prior studies, 
the trial provided direct information on the sensitivity of FIT and 
fecal DNA testing for large serrated class lesions. FIT sensitivity 
for sessile serrated polyps 1 cm or larger in size was 5%, compared 
with 42% for the multitarget stool DNA test. Th
 is FIT sensitivity 
was similar to the overall false-positive rate for the study, indicat-
ing that in this trial, FIT was ineff
 ective in detecting sessile ser-
rated polyps.
 
FIT vs. sigmoidoscopy 
 
. 
  
Six studies compared the participa-
tion and yield of screening sigmoidoscopy and FIT ( 
Table 5 
) 
( 
40,56,65–68 
). Th
 ree of the studies were randomized trials that 
examined both participation rates and yields ( 
56,65,66 
). In 1 trial, 
participation was better with FIT (61%) than fl
 exible sigmoidos-
copy [FS] (32%) ( 
56 
), but participation was nearly identical in the 
other 2 studies ( 
65,66 
). In all 3 trials, advanced adenoma detec-
tion was superior with FS, but cancer detection was not signifi
 -
cantly diff
 erent.
 
One recent study reported the benefi
 ts of 1-time screening FS 
relative to FIT for proximal colon lesion detection ( 
68 
). Th
 e study 
simulated FS by using data derived from colonoscopy examina-
tions completed as part of the ColonPrev trial (ClinicalTrials.gov 
number: NCT00906997) in Spain. Similar to the studies discussed 
earlier, overall advanced neoplasia detection was better in the 
FS-simulated group (6.3%) relative to the FIT arm (2.7%). However, 
the 2 modalities did not diff
 er in advanced proximal neoplasia 
detection (odds ratio [OR] of FS vs. FIT, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.78–1.76).
 
FIT vs. colonoscopy 
 
. 
  
Th
 ree RCTs currently underway compare a 
screening strategy using total colonoscopy with FIT using an end 
point of CRC mortality ( 
69–71 
). One of the 3 studies (ColonPrev)

levels of specifi
 city. Th
 ere is RCT-level evidence that adherence is 
superior for single-sample FIT compared with traditional 3-card 
gFOBT. Given these advantages, we recommend the use of FIT 
over gFOBT.  
Strong recommendation; high-quality evidence. 
 
PROGRAMMATIC CONSIDERATIONS
 
How many FIT kits/samples should be applied per cycle and at 
what interval?
 
Number of samples 
 
. 
  
Th
 e number of FIT samples needed for test 
completion (e.g., from a single bowel movement vs. multiple 
bowel movements across days) is an important consideration for 
optimizing CRC screening. In a Dutch study, van Roon  
et al 
. ( 
75 
) 
examined participation and clinical outcomes with 1 or 2 FITs 
(OC-Sensor, Eiken Chemical Co, Tokyo, Japan; cut-off
  value, 
10 μ 
g/g). Th
 ere was no diff
 erence in participation, but 2-sample 
FIT was associated with a higher detection rate of advanced ne-
oplasia (4.1% [95% CI, 3.3–5.1%] vs. 3.1% [95% CI, 2.5–3.8%]) 
( 
75 
). In a Korean-based study examining the diagnostic accura-
cy of FIT with increasing FIT sample numbers, Park  
et al. ( 
33 
) 
showed that a 2-sample FIT (OC-SENSA MICRO; Eiken Chemi-
cal Co, Tokyo, Japan; cut-off
  value, 15 μ 
g/g) had better sensitivity 
for CRC than a 1-sample FIT (92.3 vs. 76.9%), with only a small 
decrease in specifi
 city (91.4 vs. 93.3%, respectively). However, if 
advanced adenoma was the target for screening, no diff
 erence 
under the receiver operator characteristic curve was seen for 
advanced neoplasia with more FIT samples, suggesting that a 
1-sample FIT is equivalent for the detection of advanced 
adenomas ( 
33 
). Likewise, investigators from Hong Kong ( 
76 
), 
France ( 
77 
), and Spain ( 
38 
) found no advantage for a second kit 
for advanced neoplasia detection.
 
A meta-analysis also showed that the pooled performance char-
acteristics of FIT for CRC were similar regardless of the number 
of FIT samples tested ( 
16 
). Th
 e pooled sensitivities for 1-, 2-, and 
3-sample FIT for CRC were as follows: 0.79 (95% CI, 0.65–0.89), 
0.77 (95% CI, 0.59–0.89), and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.66–0.89), respec-
tively, in an asymptomatic, average-risk population ( 
16 
). Th
 e 
pooled specifi
 cities for 1-, 2-, and 3-sample FIT were as follows: 
0.94 (95% CI, 0.92–0.95), 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90–0.95), and 0.93 
(95% CI, 0.89–0.95), respectively ( 
16 
). Similarly a cost-eff
 ective-
ness analysis using the MIcrosimulation SCreening ANalysis 
(MISCAN)-Colon model examined 1-vs. 2-sample FITs under a 
host of diff
 erent screening assumptions (e.g., hemoglobin thresh-
olds, intervals) ( 
78 
). Intensifying screening through shorter inter-
vals between screening tests, for example, found 1-sample testing 
was more cost eff
 ective than 2-sample testing. Th
 e fi
 ndings from 
the meta-analysis ( 
16 
) and cost-eff
 ectiveness analysis ( 
78 
) suggest 
that a simpler 1-sample FIT regimen provides similar results for

techniques to detect human hemoglobin ( 
80 
). In general, quali-
tative FITs have a preset cut-off
  level for fecal hemoglobin con-
centration using lateral fl
 ow immunochromatographic analysis 
to determine FIT positivity. Th
 ese qualitative FITs use similar 
technology adopted from many point-of-care tests for hormones 
and drugs. In contrast, quantitative FITs use immunoturbidimet-
ric methods to measure fecal hemoglobin concentration and the 
cut-off
  fecal hemoglobin concentration for a positive test result 
can be adjusted by the end user. However, the FDA requires all 
quantitative FITs to be reported as positive or negative depending 
on the cut-off
  value for a positive test (reporting the fecal hemo-
globin concentration is not permitted). Currently in the United 
States ( 
Supplementary Table 1 online 
), the vast majority of FDA-
cleared devices are qualitative tests, with only 2 quantitative sys-
tems available: the OC-Auto Micro 80 and the OC-Sensor Diana 
from Polymedoc (Cortland Manor, NY) and the i-Chroma system 
from Boditech (Chuncheon, South Korea).
 
In a meta-analysis of 4 qualitative and 4 quantitative FIT brands, 
the performance characteristics for CRC detection were similar 
( 
16 
). Th
 e pooled sensitivity of quantitative FITs for CRC was 77% 
compared with 85% with qualitative FITs. Both FIT formats had 
a specifi
 city of 94%. Two recent studies not included in the meta-
analysis directly have compared the performance of a qualitative 
vs. a quantitative FIT in the screening setting ( 
81,82 
). Both sug-
gested improved detection with the quantitative FIT. In the fi
 rst 
study ( 
81 
), although the positivity rate of the qualitative test was 
3 times higher than the quantitative one (8.1 vs. 2.5%), there was 
an improved positive predictive value for cancer with the quantita-
tive test (14.4 vs. 5.2%), which is predictable using a more-specifi
 c, 
less-sensitive test. Th
 e second study observed that the quantitative 
CRC detection to more complicated multisample regimens, par-
ticularly if short intervals between screenings (i.e., 1 year) are used.
 
Interval for repeat FIT screening 
 
. 
  
Programmatic screening with 
gFOBT performed annually decreases CRC-related mortality by 
up to 33% ( 
5 
). However, the optimal interval for CRC screening 
using FIT remains unclear. Presently, 2 ongoing RCTs are com-
paring colonoscopy with annual or biennial FIT screening for 
the risk of CRC incidence and mortality ( 
69,70 
) and the results 
will not be available for at least another 10 years. However, in a 
cost-eff
 ectiveness analysis, Zauber  
et al. ( 
79 
) showed that a high-
sensitivity fecal-based screening test (i.e., FIT) performed annu-
ally yielded similar life-years gained compared with colonoscopy 
performed every 10 years. In the Dutch FIT-based screening pro-
gram, the detection of advanced neoplasia was not infl
 uenced by 
the interval length when varied over 1 to 3 years ( 
51 
). As noted 
earlier, Goede  
et al. 
 ( 
78 
) performed a cost-eff
 ectiveness analysis 
directly comparing 1-sample vs. 2-sample FIT. Annual screening 
strategies were favored over multiple tests in a given cycle.
 
Recommendation
 
Based on currently available evidence, including the systematic 
reviews discussed earlier, the Task Force suggests a 1-sample 
annual FIT screening approach ( 
Table 7 
).

tion; low-quality evidence.

test has an improved positive predictive value relative to the quali-
tative test for both large adenomas and cancer ( 
82 
).
 
Qualitative FITs have other notable limitations. Interpreting the 
test as negative or positive may be more subjective than quantitative 
tests (such as the Polymedco OC-Auto Micro) that use automated 
reading ( 
83 
). Also, Hundt  
et al. 
 ( 
42 
) showed that performance 
characteristics for advanced adenoma vary widely across FIT man-
ufacturers when analyzing the same stool specimen, which cannot 
be attributed entirely to the diff
 erent preset cut-off
  values used by 
each manufacturer. Moreover, in a US population-based screening 
study, Levy  
et al. ( 
84 
) discovered that 2 qualitative FITs (Clearview 
iFOB Complete [Alere, Orlando, FL] and OC-Light, [Polymedco, 
Cortland Manor, NY]) had quality-control issues; both FITs did 
not test positive at the preset cut-off
  value and one did not test 
positive at the lower limit of the manufacturer’
s stated sensitivity. 
One study evaluating 6 qualitative FIT tests observed that some 
tests used detection levels resulting in unacceptably low specifi
 c-
ity for large-scale screening programs ( 
85 
). Th
 us, automated and 
well-studied quantitative FITs appear to have an advantage in 
consistency of performance characteristics for CRC and advanced 
adenomas, effi
  ciency, and quality control. In addition, the ability of 
quantitative FITs to select and potentially adjust fecal hemoglobin 
cut-off
  concentrations to defi
 ne a positive test allows the end user 
to meet endoscopic resource demands and select target clinical 
sensitivity or PPV for advanced neoplasia detection. For exam-
ple, using data from those participating in a FIT-based program 
in Barcelona ( 
n 
=3,109), investigators determined that those with a 
fecal hemoglobin concentration greater than 177 μ 
g/g were nearly 
4 times more likely to harbor advanced neoplasia than those with 
a fecal hemoglobin concentration below this level (OR, 3.80; 95% 
CI, 3.07–4.71) ( 
86 
).
 
What should be the optimal cut-off
  value for a positive FIT test? 
 
. 
 
 
Identifying an optimal cut-off
  value for defi
 ning a positive FIT 
result is crucial for any CRC screening program. Th
 is cut-off
  value 
infl
 uences both the number of cancers detected and the number of 
colonoscopies needed to follow-up these positive tests. In a meta-
analysis, Lee  
et al. ( 
16 
) showed that varying the cut-off
  values used 
to defi
 ne an abnormal test result infl
 uenced the performance char-
acteristics of FIT for CRC. Th
 e sensitivity of 1-time screening FIT 
for CRC decreased with increasing cut-off
  values, from 0.86 (95% CI, 
0.75–0.92) using cut-off
  values less than 20 μ 
g/g, to 0.67 (95% CI, 
0.59–0.74) using cut-off
  values greater than 50 μ 
g/g. Conversely, the 
specifi
 city increased from 0.91 (95% CI, 0.89–0.93) to 0.96 (95% CI, 
0.94–0.98). Th
 is trade-off
  in sensitivity and specifi
 city with varying 
cut-off
  values also aff
 ects the accuracy of FIT for the detection of 
advanced neoplasms in screening populations ( 
25,29,41 
).
 
In the meta-analysis, the FIT cut-off
  value of less than 20 μ 
g/g 
had the best combination of sensitivity and specifi
 city for CRC 
compared with cut-off
  values ranging from 20 to 50 μ 
g/g or greater 
( 
16 
). However, colonoscopy resources are an important considera-
tion when choosing a threshold for a positive FIT. Studies included 
in the meta-analysis using a 1-sample FIT with cut-off

patients testing positive on a stool-based test, err on over-reporting 
equivocal fi
 ndings. Holleran  
et al. ( 
91 
) directly assessed CCE 
performance in 62 FIT-positive participants who agreed to 
undergo both CCE and colonoscopy. Although sensitivity for 
neoplasia detection was good (95%), specifi
 city was not (65%). In 
addition, CCE provided a complete colon evaluation in just 73% 
of participants, with the remainder not having it reach the dentate 
line during the recording time.
 
 
Separate from the issue of which test to use to evaluate a positive 
FIT is whether subsequent testing is needed if the colon evalua-
tion is unrevealing. Hemoglobin is degraded as it moves through 
the gastrointestinal tract and therefore FIT testing is viewed as 
specifi
 c for lower-tract bleeding. Th
 erefore, the test would less 
likely be falsely positive in patients with upper-tract disease, such 
as severe esophagitis or gastritis. However, there are very limited 
clinical data evaluating this issue. In a single study in which FIT 
testing was applied simultaneously along with upper-tract imaging 
by barium meal, the gastric cancer detection rate was no diff
 erent 
between patients with a positive FIT (0.15%) and patients with a 
negative FIT (0.13%) ( 
92 
).
 
Individuals with a recent colonoscopy 
 
. 
 
  
 
Early repeat testing with 
gFOBT occurs frequently in practice despite a recent colonosco-
py, presumably because of concerns of missed lesions and lesions 
with a more aggressive biology ( 
93 
). Because repeating gFOBT 
early can lead to subsequent unnecessary testing and higher 
health care costs, the Centers for Disease Control and multiple 
guidelines recommend suspending gFOBT for at least 10 years 
aft
 er a normal colonoscopy ( 
94–96 
). Th
 is recommendation is 
based on expert opinion and the low positive predictive value of 
interval gFOBT for clinically signifi
 cant colonic neoplasia ( 
93–96 
). 
One study found that only 1% of gFOBT-positive individuals were 
detected with an advanced neoplasm when they had a negative 
screening colonoscopy within the past 5 years ( 
93 
). Despite FIT’
s 
superior test performance characteristics compared with gFOBT, 
there are limited data to inform clinicians on the optimal 
approach to asymptomatic patients with a positive FIT who had a 
recent colonoscopy and are not due for repeat examination.
 
Prior studies have suggested that interval FIT testing is capable 
of detecting neoplasia in the high-risk adult population undergoing 
colonoscopic surveillance ( 
97,98 
). Bampton  
et al. ( 
97 
) reported that 
a fi
 rst time FIT detected clinically signifi
 cant neoplasia (defi
 ned as 
CRC, adenomas >10 mm, adenomas with villous or high-grade dys-
plastic features, or >3 adenomas of any size) in 1.8% of subjects who 
were enrolled in a colonoscopy-based surveillance program for either 
a personal or family history of colonic neoplasia. Lane  
et al. ( 
98 
) 
showed that interval FIT, in patients who had at least 2 prior colo-
noscopy examinations and with personal or family history of colonic 
neoplasia, detected 12 of 14 CRCs (86% sensitivity) and 60 of 96 (63% 
sensitivity) advanced adenomas during follow-up evaluation.
 
Recommendation/Summary
 
 
When FIT is positive in screen-eligible individuals, colonos-
copy is the recommended test for subsequent evaluation.  
Strong 
recommendation; moderate-quality evidence. 
simulation modeling analysis using a quantitative FIT (OC-Sensor), 
Wilschut  
et al. 
 ( 
87 
) compared many diff
 erent cut-off
  strategies, 
ranging from 10 to 150 μ 
g/g, and found that a cut-off
  value of 
10 μ 
g/g was the most effi
  cient and cost-eff
 ective strategy for CRC 
screening, assuming a specifi
 city of 95.8%. A study using the OC-
Sensor Diana instrument in 14,289 Korean participants showed no 
signifi
 cant diff
 erence in advanced neoplasia detection when com-
paring those undergoing testing with a threshold of 20 mg hgb/g 
feces (29.9%) vs. a threshold of 10 mg hgb/g feces (30.8%) ( 
88 
).
 
Based on these studies, a low cut-off
  (<20 μ 
g/g) FIT off
 ers the 
best performance characteristics (i.e., combination of sensitivity, 
specifi
 city, and overall diagnostic accuracy) for the detection of 
CRC while also being cost eff
 ective. However, selecting an optimal 
FIT cut-off
  value also should include factors such as the positivity 
rate, available colonoscopy resources, and the brand of FIT used.
 
Recommendations
 
Performance characteristics of quantitative and qualitative FITs 
for neoplasia appear generally similar. However, the Task Force 
suggests that quantitative FITs be selected over qualitative FITs. 
Th
 is recommendation is based on improved quality control with 
automated reading and the ability to adjust fecal hemoglobin cut-
off
  concentrations to defi
 ne a positive test.  
Weak recommenda-
tion; low-quality evidence. 
 
Th
 e optimal cut-off
  value for FIT should be determined by its 
performance characteristics, cost eff
 ectiveness, FIT device, and 
the screening program’
s available colonoscopy resources. Based 
on the limited evidence, the Task Force favors a lower threshold 
cut-off
  FIT (i.e., <20 μ 
g/g) to defi
 ne a positive test. Th
 e decision 
to recommend use of FIT with a hemoglobin threshold including 
20 μ 
g/g (not just less than that threshold) refl
 ects, in part, a practi-
cal consideration because that threshold currently is used by the 
commonly available quantitative test in the United States.  
Weak 
recommendation; low-quality evidence. 
 
When FIT Is positive, what evaluation is recommended?
 
Screen-eligible individuals 
 
. 
  
In most cases, those with a positive 
FIT would be screen-eligible at the time the test result returns. 
As reviewed earlier, when FIT is positive, the PPV for signifi
 cant 
neoplasia is high. Colonoscopy is the one structural examina-
tion that both directly evaluates the entire colorectal mucosa and 
aff
 ords the opportunity to simultaneously remove signifi
 cant 
neoplasia. Given these characteristics, it is the optimal test to 
follow up on a positive screen and has been recommended 
previously by the Task Force for this indication ( 
89 
).
 
Computerized tomographic colonography and colon capsule 
endoscopy (CCE) are 2 other structural tests that have been evalu-
ated in patients with a positive stool test ( 
90,91 
). A meta-analysis 
summarized 5 studies in which individuals were either gFOBT or 
FIT positive and underwent computerized tomographic colonog-
raphy and a verifi
 cation test (generally colonoscopy). Although 
sensitivity for adenomas 6 mm or larger was reasonably good 
(average, 89%; 95% CI, 84–92%), specifi
 city suff
 ered (average, 
75.4%; 95% CI, 59–87%) ( 
90 
). Th
 ese results raise concerns that

 cant fi
 ndings in

Th
 e Task Force suggests that in the absence of iron-defi
 ciency 
anemia or signs or symptoms of upper gastrointestinal pathol-
ogy, a positive FIT and a negative colonoscopy should not prompt 
upper gastrointestinal evaluation.  
Weak recommendation; very 
low quality evidence. 
 
Given FIT’
s superior performance characteristics compared with 
gFOBT, the Task Force suggests that those with a positive FIT and 
a recent colonoscopy (i.e., before the individual would be due for 
repeat endoscopic examination) generally should be off
 ered repeat 
colonoscopy. Additional considerations for off
 ering a colonoscopy 
include clinical context (e.g., other worrisome signs, symptoms, or 
laboratory values), patient factors (e.g., risk factors for advanced 
neoplasia, patient preferences), and prior colonoscopy examina-
tion quality (e.g., poor bowel preparation, endoscopist’
s adenoma 
detection rate).  
Weak recommendation; low-quality evidence. 
 
Is dietary or medicine adjustment necessary with FIT?
 
One major limitation of gFOBT is a high false-positive rate related 
to dietary intake of foods with peroxidase activity. Equally worri-
some is that dietary intake (e.g., ascorbic acid) also can decrease 
test sensitivity systematically ( 
7 
). To overcome these limitations, 
screening participants restrict their diet during the period of test-
ing and submit multiple stool samples (e.g., generally 3 separate 
samples). Unlike gFOBT, FIT testing is not confounded by the 
dietary intake of foods with peroxidase activity.
 
Certain medications lower gFOBT specifi
 city by facilitating 
bleeding from sources other than colorectal neoplasms. Limited 
data suggest that intake of aspirin, warfarin, and clopidogrel lower 
the positive predictive value of conventional gFOBT for advanced 
neoplasia detection ( 
99 
). In contrast, 2 high-quality prospective 
studies examining test characteristic in users of aspirin, non-
steroidal anti-infl
 ammatory drugs, and anticoagulants in patients 
receiving a FIT before screening colonoscopy suggest no negative 
impact on test characteristics ( 
100,101 
). In each case, sensitivity 
was improved for patients on antiplatelet therapy ( 
100,101 
) or anti-
coagulant therapy ( 
100 
), with little decrease in specifi
 city. Th
 ree 
studies examined the PPV of FIT in users of asprin ( 
102,103 
) or 
anticoagulants ( 
102,104 
) and found no evidence of diminished test 
performance comparing users with nonusers of these medications.
 
Recommendation/Summary
 
Th
 ere is no rationale to adjust diet or anticoagulation or anti-
platelet agents when using FIT-based screening. Th
 e Task Force 
recommends that, to simplify testing and enhance adherence, 
patients should be instructed explicitly that they do not need to 
adjust diet or medications to complete a FIT test.  
Strong recom-
mendation; moderate-quality evidence. 
 
Is a single in-offi
 ce sample obtained on digital rectal 
examination acceptable?
 
 
Both the American Cancer Society and the United States Multi-
Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer recommend against 
using a digital rectal examination (DRE) during a clinical encoun-
ter for completion of gFOBT screening ( 
89 
). Th
 is recommenda-
tion refl
 ects experience with gFOBT testing and the concern that 
individuals may be falsely reassured by a negative in-offi
  ce test and 
will not complete the multiple gFOBT cards required for screen-
ing. In fact, evidence suggests that the sensitivity of in-offi
  ce test-
ing for advanced neoplasia and CRC detection is very low ( 
105 
).
 
Th
 e situation with FIT is diff
 erent because a single stool sam-
ple can be used for screening. For some FIT kits, testing a stool 
sample obtained on DRE with the collection device would simply 
be impractical. Although it may be possible to test a DRE stool 
sample with some FIT devices, one study showed signifi
 cantly dif-
ferent test performance when comparing results based on a passed 
stool sample vs. a sample obtained on a DRE ( 
106 
). When compar-
ing the 2 approaches in patients presenting for a medical check-
up ( 
n 
=1,688), the positivity rate when using the DRE sample was 
higher (5.4 vs. 3.5% with a passed stool sample), which translated 
into a signifi
 cantly lower PPV for both adenomas and cancer using 
the DRE.
 
Summary/Recommendation
 
Th
 ere is limited information examining the test characteristics of 
FIT when applied to a stool specimen obtained by DRE. Available 
data suggest that test characteristics may suff
 er. Th
 e Task Force 
suggests that FIT screening programs rely on spontaneously 
passed stool specimens and not an inoffi
  ce DRE sample.  
Weak 
recommendation; very low quality evidence. 
 
Should FIT screening be performed during warmer seasons?
 
Because the FIT process requires a stable hemoglobin molecule 
for a reliable test result, there are concerns about FIT performance 
when samples are returned during warm summer months. In an 
Italian population-based study, Grazzini  
et al. ( 
107 
) showed that 
an increase in temperature of 1 °C reduced the probability of a 
positive FIT (OC-Sensor; cut-off
  value, 20 μ 
g/g) by 0.7%, result-
ing in a 13% reduction in the probability of detecting advanced 
neoplasia during the summer compared with the winter season. 
Recently, van Roon  
et al. ( 
108 
) tracked FIT positivity rates accord-
ing to calendar month and average outside temperature. In this 
study based in Th
 e Netherlands, a modest negative association 
was seen between outside temperature and FIT (OC-Sensor; 
cut-off
  value, 10 μ 
g/g) positivity rates.
 
 
An odds ratio of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96–0.99) was found for FIT 
being positive with each degree in Celsius increase in average out-
side temperature ( 
108 
). In addition, positivity rates were signifi
 -
cantly higher during the winter compared with the summer season 
(9.7 vs. 8.0%, respectively; P=0.006). However, this was not con-
sistent across each of the summer months. Cha  
et al. ( 
109 
) exam-
ined the same issue within the Korean national screening program 
( 
n 
=8,316) using a 1-sample FIT (OC-Sensor Diana). When sam-
ples were completed at higher temperatures (≥25 °C) compared 
with lower temperatures (<10 °C), the hemoglobin concentration 
of the sample was signifi
 cantly lower (0.25 vs. 0.36 ng/ml hgb). 
However, the diff
 erence was relatively small and did not trans-
late into a signifi
 cant diff
 erence in the rates of positivity, adenoma 
detection, or advanced adenoma detection ( 
109 
). Chausserie  
et al. 
( 
110 
) examined the impact of seasonal variation on FIT per-
formance in a French screening program (OC-Sensor; positive

be delivered, completed, and returned for processing. FIT will be 
eff
 ective only when completed, and there is evidence that naviga-
tion tools can be helpful in this regard ( 
116 
). Upon receipt of the 
completed kit, the receiving laboratory should assess the suitabil-
ity of the kit for testing (e.g., not damaged or expired) and report 
the result according to the kit manufacturer’
s guidelines. Finally, 
the result needs to be delivered to the patient and when the test is 
positive, in most cases, colonoscopy completed. When the test on 
a given cycle is negative, systems should be in place to screen with 
FIT again in the following cycle (generally 1 year).
 
Few data are available to guide the development of quality 
benchmarks for FIT processes. Given the similarities to gFOBT-
based programs, examining results from these programs may be 
informative. Ontario’
s ColonCancerCheck program reported that 
29.8% of those eligible participated in screening, and when FOBT 
was positive, 74.6% proceeded to colonoscopy in 6 months ( 
117 
). 
Higher participation rates were reported from England (52%)
( 
118 
) and Finland (70%) ( 
119 
). Th
 e follow-up colonoscopy rate 
in Ontario also was lower than that reported in England (83%) 
( 
118 
).  
Table 3 shows similar metrics across a range of FIT-based 
programs that have reported results across multiple rounds of 
FIT-based testing. Participation rates of 60% appear consistent 
across rounds. In these studies, colonoscopy completion rates for 
those with a positive test are in the 80–90% range. Rates of colo-
noscopy completion for those who are FIT positive were signifi
 -
cantly higher in the Kaiser Permanente system relative to 2 other 
US-based health care systems ( 
120 
).
 
A more important measure of a FIT-based program is neo-
plasia detection. As reviewed earlier, establishing benchmarks 
for CRC detection would be diffi
  cult for most centers given the 
relatively low likelihood of that fi
 nding and because the PPV for 
cancer decreases with subsequent rounds of testing. Establishing 
benchmarks for adenoma detection might be plausible. One chal-
lenge is that the PPV for adenoma does vary as the hemoglobin 
threshold for a positive test changes and with multiple rounds of 
testing ( 
Supplementary Table 2 
). Generally, in most series, 
the PPV for any adenoma detection is greater than 45%. In the 
large, recently reported US experience at Kaiser (OC FIT Check; 
threshold, 20 μ 
g/hgb), the PPV remained quite consistent across 
all 4 rounds of testing (47.4–51.5%) ( 
52 
). As expected, the posi-
tive predictive value for adenoma was higher in men (55%) than 
in women (42%).
 
Summary/Recommendation
 
Similar to colonoscopy-based programs, FIT-based screening 
programs require careful attendance to quality assurance in pro-
vision of the test. Studies showing improved outcomes for selected 
measures in this area are needed. As this information is being 
developed, the committee suggests the following quality metrics 
for FIT-based testing programs:
• 
 
FIT completion rate to those off
 ered testing of 60% or 
greater; 
• 
 
Proportion returning FIT that cannot be processed by the 
laboratory of less than 5%; 
cut-off
  value, 30 mg hgb/g feces). Positivity was lower in the 
summer months relative to other seasons (2.3 vs. 3.0%;  
P 
=0.03).
 
Recommendation/Summary
 
Although limited data have indicated that ambient temperature 
aff
 ects test positivity, current evidence is insuffi
  cient to recom-
mend against distributing or mailing FITs when outside tempera-
tures are above a certain level. Programs using FIT should adhere 
closely to test manufacturer’
s specifi
 cations regarding storage and 
transport to minimize the eff
 ect of sample instability on FIT per-
formance.  
Weak recommendation; low-quality evidence. 
 
Are FIT characteristics infl
 uenced by sample return time?
 
Sample stability over time is an important consideration with FIT 
because of the relative instability of the globin protein (relative to 
heme) in the collection systems used. Degradation of the sample 
is a particular concern for FITs that place fresh stool in a sample 
bottle including buff
 er. In fact, van Rossum  
et al. ( 
111 
) identifi
 ed 
a decrease in sample positivity rates in those with a delay in pro-
cessing of 5 or more days (positivity, 6%) relative to those pro-
cessed without delay (8.7%). However, in a study based in Th
 e 
Netherlands, van Roon  
et al. ( 
108 
) found that FIT sample return 
times of up to 10 days did not decrease the positivity or detection 
rates of FIT. Similarly, in a report from the French screening pro-
gram, processing delays of up to 10 days had no eff
 ect on positiv-
ity rates ( 
110 
). Eff
 orts to improve stabilization buff
 ers are ongoing 
and should further limit the impact of this factor on FIT-based 
programs ( 
112 
).
 
Summary/Recommendation
 
Th
 ere is no strong evidence that delays in FIT kit return of up to 
10 days aft
 er sample deposit aff
 ects FIT performance. Nonethe-
less, the Task Force suggests that participants in FIT-based pro-
grams should be informed about the importance of rapid return 
of the kit (i.e., preferably mailing it or returning it to the labora-
tory within 24 h) once the sample has been deposited. Further-
more, programs should establish quality-assurance practices to 
monitor return times of the FIT kits and solicit repeat samples 
when kits fall outside the predetermined range of acceptability 
based on the device used (as established by the manufacturer). 
 
Weak recommendation; very low quality evidence. 
 
What are the key quality metrics to measure in a FIT-based 
program
 
Priority quality indicators for colonoscopy include cecal intuba-
tion rate, adenoma detection rate, and use of recommended sur-
veillance intervals ( 
113 
). Th
 e success of any FIT-based program 
is predicated in part on the quality of colonoscopy performed 
for those who have positive tests ( 
114 
). However, this is just 
one element of a successful FIT-based program. Although some 
guidelines have been proposed for FIT-based programs ( 
115 
), 
signifi
 cant work remains to be performed in this area.
 
Figure 1 outlines the key processes and potential opportuni-
ties for quality measurement in a FIT-based program. Once the 
target population for FIT screening is identifi
 ed, the FIT needs to
