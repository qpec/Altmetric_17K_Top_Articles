Abstract
It is unknown whether sedentary behavior is independently associated with the cardiometabolic 
health of adults with severe obesity. Additionally, there is debate regarding how best to derive 
meaningful indices of sedentary time (ST) from activity monitor data. A convenience sample of 
adults with severe obesity (N=927; 79% female, median age 45y, median body mass index (BMI) 
46 kg/m2) completed a research assessment at one of ten US hospitals in 2006-2009 prior to 
bariatric surgery. Cardiometabolic health was assessed via physical measures, fasting blood 
samples and medication use. Indices of ST were derived from StepWatch™ activity monitor data 
with minimum bout durations of 1 min, 10 min and 30 min. Cross-sectional associations were 
examined. Median (25th, 75th percentile) ST was 9.3 hr/d (8.1, 10.5) in ≥1 min bouts, 6.5 hr/d (5.2, 
8.0) in ≥10 min bouts, or 3.2 hr/d (2.1, 4.5) in ≥30 min bouts. Associations with ST were generally 
strongest with the ≥10 min bout duration. Independent of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical 
activity, BMI and other potential confounders, 1 hr/day ST in ≥10 min bouts was associated with 
higher odds of diabetes by 15% (95%CI: 1.05-1.26), metabolic syndrome by 12% (95%CI: 
1.01-1.24) and elevated blood pressure by 14% (95%CI: 1.02-1.26), and was associated with 1.4 
cm (95%CI: 0.9-1.9) larger waist circumference. Findings indicate the importance of considering 
ST as a distinct health risk among adults with severe obesity, and suggest a 10 min minimum 
duration may be preferable to 1 min or 30 min for establishing ST from activity monitor data.

Physical activity (PA) is well recognized as an important contributor to cardiometabolic 
health. In particular, participation in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity 
(MVPA) has been shown to improve blood pressure, lipid profile and glycemic control (1), 
and play an important role in weight maintenance (2), making MVPA central to guidelines

 for the prevention and management of heart disease and type 2 diabetes (3). There is 
mounting evidence that sedentary behavior, i.e., prolonged sitting or reclining characterized 
by very low energy expenditure, may also play an important role in cardiovascular and 
metabolic health, independent of participation in MVPA (4-6).
In the United States, 15% of the adult population has severe obesity, defined as body mass 
index (BMI) ≥35 kg/m2 (8). Those affected generally have difficulty meeting MVPA 
recommendations (9) and are at high risk of cardiovascular and metabolic disease, and 
premature mortality (10;11). Thus, determining whether sedentary behavior is related to the 
cardiometabolic health in this population could have important implications for PA 
recommendations, which currently do not include goals specific to sedentary behavior (1;9).
The majority of studies establishing associations between sedentary behavior and 
cardiometabolic health have relied on self-report questionnaires (4), which are prone to 
social desirability and recall bias. Over the last few years, studies utilizing activity monitor 
data to objectively-measure ST have provided initial evidence that ST is associated with 
composite and individual measures of poor cardiometabolic health in a variety of 
populations (5;12-15). However, there is debate regarding the most appropriate way to 
derive meaningful indices of ST from activity monitor data (5;14). Recent laboratory-based 
studies show that interrupting prolonged bouts of sedentary behavior with brief PA breaks 
(e.g. walking at low or moderate intensity for 1-5 minutes) can have acute beneficial effects 
on blood pressure, and lipid and glucose metabolism (6;7), suggesting the duration of 
sedentary bouts is a key element to consider. However, most studies employing activity 
monitors to measure ST have counted all minutes below a set threshold indicative of very 
low energy expenditure (e.g., <1.5 metabolic equivalents, <100 activity counts) or lack of 
ambulatory activity (e.g., <1 step) as ST, allowing sedentary bouts to be as short as 1 minute 
(5). Kim et al. recently investigated the effect of applying various minimum duration 
requirements, ranging from 1 minute to 30 minutes, to ST (14). They found that more ST 
accumulated in bouts of <5 minutes was associated with lower cardiovascular risk (i.e., 
smaller waist circumference, higher high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and lower 
triglycerides), while more ST accumulated in bouts ≥10 minutes was associated with higher 
risk, highlighting the importance of considering duration when defining ST.
To date, no studies have investigated the association between ST and cardiometabolic health 
in adults with severe obesity. The present investigation aimed to fill this gap by examining 
associations between activity monitor-derived ST with cardiometabolic health, among adults 
with severe obesity prior to undergoing bariatric surgery. In response to recommendations 
for continued research on definitions and measurement of ST (16), three minimum bout 
duration thresholds (≥1 minute, ≥10 minutes and ≥30 minutes) were applied to ST and 
examined with respect to the metabolic syndrome, its components, and diabetes.

 Bariatric Surgery-2 (LABS-2) study between February 2006 and February 2009, resulting in 
a cohort of 2458. The Institutional Review Boards at each center approved the protocol and 
consent forms. The LABS-2 study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00465829).
The study reported here is cross sectional utilizing data from the baseline research 
assessment which was conducted by trained research personnel prior to surgery. The 
analysis sample is a convenience sample of 927 (37.7%) LABS-2 participants with valid PA 
data (Figure 1). Participants in this observational study received usual preoperative care 
which, depending on the center, may have included advice or counseling related to health 
behaviors, including PA. However, patients were not required to change their PA level in 
preparation for surgery.
Cardiometabolic Health
Waist circumference was measured twice while the participant was standing using the 
Gulick II Tape Measure (model 67020, Gays Mill, Wisconsin). The measurement was taken 
around the abdomen horizontally at the midpoint between the highest point of the iliac crest 
(hip bone) and lowest part of the costal margin (ribs). A single measurement of systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP, respectively) was obtained using a Welch Allyn 
Spot Vital Signs monitor (model 4200B, Welch Allyn, Skaneateles Falls, New York) after a 
seated rest of at least five minutes, with no caffeine or nicotine intake for at least 30 minutes. 
Arm circumference was measured to ensure appropriate cuff size was utilized. The 
therapeutic class(es) of reported prescription medications was used to determine whether 
participants were on anti-hypertensive, anti-hyperlipidemic or anti-diabetic medication.
Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) 
were measured by the Northwest Lipid Metabolism and Diabetes Research Laboratories 
(Seattle, WA). Triglycerides and glucose are only reported for fasting (≥8 hours) samples. 
However, because glucose and triglyceride are higher in a non-fasting state, when fasting 
values were not available, non-fasting values below thresholds (specified below) were used 
to categorize participants as not having elevated glucose or elevated triglycerides, 
respectively.
Per updated National Cholesterol Education Program criteria (17) participants were 
classified as having metabolic syndrome if three or more of the following criteria were met: 
(1) central obesity: waist circumference >88 cm for females, >102 cm for males; (2) 
elevated triglycerides: triglyceride ≥150 mg/dL or anti-hyperlipidemic medication use; (3) 
low HDL: HDL <50 mg/dL for females, <40 mg/dL for males; (4) elevated blood pressure: 
SBP ≥130 or DBP ≥85 mm Hg or anti-hypertensive medication use; or (5) elevated glucose: 
glucose ≥100 mg/dL or anti-diabetic medication use.
Diabetes was defined as taking diabetes medication or having HbA1c ≥6.5%, or if HbA1c 
was not available, glucose ≥126 mg/dL. Women taking only metformin as a diabetes 
medication who reported having polycystic ovarian syndrome and who did not meet 
laboratory criteria for diabetes were not considered to have diabetes.

 Activity monitor-based ST
The StepWatch™ 3 activity monitor (OrthoCare Innovations, Washington, D.C.) is a small 
lightweight microprocessor-controlled biaxial activity monitor, worn above the ankle that 
combines acceleration, position, and timing information to count strides (i.e. single leg-
steps). It is accurate in individuals who are lean or obese with a variety of gait styles at 
“slow” (i.e., 1.6 km/h) through “fast” (i.e., 5.6 km/h) speeds, with accuracy typically 
exceeding 98% (18-20). The monitor was programmed to double count strides (to record 
steps) in 1 minute intervals with sensitivity settings appropriate to a participant's height, gait, 
and cadence using accompanying software during monitor initialization (19). Eligible 
participants (i.e., not excluded per Figure 1) were asked to wear the monitor for the seven 
consecutive days following their research assessment or until the day of surgery, whichever 
came first. Participants were given the option to remove the waterproof monitor during 
water-based activities or sleeping.
Steps per minute (cadence) data from StepWatch™ version 3.2 software (OrthoCare 
Innovations, Washington, D.C.) were exported to a SAS dataset, version 9.3 (SAS Institute 
Inc, Cary, NC). Sleep and non-wear periods were identified by intervals of at least 120 
minutes with 0 steps (21). After removing sleep and non-wear periods, ST, defined as 
minutes with a step count of 0 (20;22), was calculated for each valid day (i.e., at least 10 
hours of awake wear time) with minimum bout durations of 1 minute (≥1 min), 10 minutes 
(≥10 min), and 30 minutes (≥30 min). ST was then averaged across valid days. ST was 
standardized to a common wear time by multiplying ST by the ratio of the mean monitor 
wear time for the entire sample to an individual's monitor wear time. This allowed ST to be 
adjusted for wear time while still represented in the metric of minutes (23). Participants with 
at least three valid days of PA assessment were included in the analysis.
Potential confounders
Age, sex, race, ethnicity, marital status, education, employment status, household income, 
smoking status and regular alcohol consumption (≥2 drinks/week) were assessed by 
questionnaire (24). Depressive symptoms over the past week were measured with the Beck 
Depression Inventory, version 1 (25). A score of 10 or higher indicates at least mild 
depressive symptoms. With bare feet and in lightweight clothing participants' weight was 
measured to the nearest pound and height was measured to the nearest inch, then converted 
to kilograms and meters. BMI was calculated as weight divided by height squared (kg/m2).
Daily minutes of MVP A was estimated with the StepWatch™. A cadence >80 steps/minute 
was selected to identify MVP A based on prior work which has shown 1) that healthy adults 
achieve moderate intensity (defined as 3 standard metabolic equivalents) at a cadence of 
approximately 100, walking at speeds of 0.9-1.2 m/s (or 2.0-2.7 mph) (26), and 2) adults 
with obesity achieve a higher activity intensity vs. adults of normal weight when walking at 
speeds within this range (27). Given the possibility that a threshold of >80 steps/minute 
might misclassify some moderate-intensity PA as light-intensity PA, a less conservative 
threshold of >60 steps/minute (28) was applied in a sensitivity analysis. Bouted MVPA, 
defined as 10 or more consecutive MVPA minutes, with allowance for interruptions of no 
more than 2 minutes below the MVPA threshold, was also calculated.

 Analysis—Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). 
Those excluded from the analysis sample were compared to those included using the chi 
square test for categorical variables or the Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables. 
Generalized linear mixed models with the log odds of outcome were used to examine the 
associations of ST indices (with minimum bout durations of ≥1 min, ≥10 min or ≥30 min) 
with presence or absence of the metabolic syndrome, each of its components, and diabetes. 
Since all participants met the central obesity criterion for the metabolic syndrome, separate 
linear mixed models were used to examine associations of ST indices with waist 
circumference. Correlation among patients in the same site was accounted for by the 
inclusion of different random intercepts for sites. All models adjusted for site, sex, age, 
household income, smoking status, regular alcohol use, depressive symptoms, BMI and 
MVPA, with the exception that the model of waist circumference was not adjusted for BMI 
due to the collinearity between these measures. A sensitivity analysis replaced MVPA with 
minutes at a cadence >60. Models did not adjust for bouted MVPA due to low participation. 
Two-way interactions between ST and covariates were tested. Statistical significance was 
set at two-sided p<0.05. Because this was an exploratory analysis, adjustment was not made 
for multiple outcomes. Adjusted odds ratios (OR), beta coefficients (β) and corresponding 
95% CI are presented.
Results
Participant Characteristics
Table 1 shows the characteristics of LABS-2 participants included in and excluded from the 
analysis sample. Of the 1531 LABS-2 participants excluded, approximately three-fourths 
were not eligible for PA assessment due to unavailability of activity monitors (a result of 
budget constraints) or insufficient time to measure PA prior to surgery (Figure 1). 
Prevalence of non-white race, income <$25,000, and severe walking limitations was lower 
in the analysis sample vs. those excluded, while prevalence of full-time employment was 
higher; there were no other significant differences between groups (Table 1). More than 
three-fourths of participants had the metabolic syndrome and almost one-third of 
participants had diabetes.
ST and MVPA
Activity monitor data of participants is shown in Table 2. The majority of participants wore 
the activity monitor 6 or 7 days and for at least 14 hr/d. Median ST was 9.3 hr/d (65.1% of 
wear time) in ≥1 minute bouts, 6.5 hr/d (44.7% of wear time) in ≥10 minute bouts, or 3.2 
hr/d (22.0% of wear time) in ≥30 minute bouts. The top quartile spent at least 8 hr/d in 
sedentary bouts ≥10 minutes, while the bottom quartile spent approximately 5 hr/d or less in 
sedentary bouts ≥10 minutes. Participation in MVPA was low, particularly bouted MVPA. 
Less than one-third of participants (32.9%; n=305) engaged in any bouted MVPA and 
among those who did, the median (25th, 75th percentile) was only 5 (2, 12) min/d. When the 
less conservative threshold of >60 steps/minute was applied, still only half of participants 
(50.1%; n=464) engaged in any bouted activity, with median (25th, 75th percentile) of 6 (3, 
12) min/d.

 Associations between ST and Cardiometabolic Health
Table 3 shows the associations between ST indices with varying minimum bout 
requirements (≥1 min, ≥10 min and ≥30 min), per 1 hour/day ST, and cardiometabolic 
outcomes. There were no significant interactions between ST indices and MVPA. 
Controlling for MVPA, BMI and other potential confounders, more ST ≥1 min was 
significantly associated with greater odds of metabolic syndrome, low HDL cholesterol, 
elevated blood pressure and elevated fasting glucose, and larger waist circumference. An 
interaction between ST ≥1 min and age indicated that the odds of low HDL associated with 
ST was higher in older vs. younger adults. More ST ≥10 min was independently associated 
with greater odds of metabolic syndrome, elevated blood pressure, diabetes and larger waist 
circumference. Although ST ≥30 min followed the same trends as ST ≥1 min and ST ≥10 
min (i.e., all estimated odds ratios >1), only associations with diabetes and waist 
circumference were significant.
Associations between ST indices and metabolic syndrome and diabetes, standardized per 
interquartile range of ST, are shown in Figure 2. The odds of metabolic syndrome and 
diabetes attributed to ST was greatest with the bout requirement ≥10 min (OR=1.34 (95% 
CI: 1.03-1.68) and OR=1.42 (95%CI: 1.14-1.74), respectively). Likewise, the beta 
coefficient for waist circumference was largest per IQR of ST ≥10 min (β=4.0 cm (95% CI: 
2.6-5.4)) vs. of ST ≥1 min (β=2.9 cm (95% CI: 1.7-4.2)) or ST ≥30 min (β=3.1 cm (95% CI: 
1.8-4.4)).
Sensitivity analysis
Some associations between ST indices with cardiometabolic outcomes were slightly 
attenuated when minutes at a cadence >60 replaced MVPA (Supplemental Table 1). 
Associations between ST indices with low HDL, fasting glucose, diabetes and waist 
circumference remained statistically significant (p for all <05), while association with 
metabolic syndrome and elevated blood pressure did not (p for all ≥.05).
Discussion
Independent of BMI, MVPA and additional confounders, objectively-measured indices of 
ST were associated with greater odds of metabolic syndrome, low HDL, elevated blood 
pressure, elevated fasting glucose and diabetes, as well as larger waist circumference in a in 
large sample of adults with severe obesity prior to undergoing bariatric surgery. These 
findings indicate the importance of investigating ST as a distinct health risk behavior, not 
simply lack of MVPA, among adults with severe obesity, which may ultimately inform PA 
recommendations for this special population.
Our finding that objectively-measured ST (≥1 min or ≥10 min), independent of MVPA, was 
associated with metabolic syndrome, has also been reported in cross-sectional studies among 
healthy middle-age Japanese adults (29), Australian adults without diabetes (30), and older 
U.S. adults (31). In contrast, a study among Flemish adults, which reported high levels of 
total and bouted MVPA, found that ST was not independently associated with metabolic 
syndrome or its components after controlling for MVPA (32). A potential explanation for

 this discrepancy is that high levels of MVPA reduce the effect of sedentary behavior. 
Findings from a meta-analysis of studies utilizing self-reported PA supports this hypothesis; 
the risk of all-cause mortality associated with ST was greater among those with low vs. high 
PA (4). To date such evidence from studies with activity monitor-derived ST is lacking. 
Although interactions between indices of ST and MVPA were not significant in the current 
study, it is possible that greater participation in MVPA than was observed is required to 
mitigate the effect of ST.
The significant association we reported between ST (≥10 min or ≥30 min) and prevalent 
diabetes is supported by findings from a meta-analysis of 10 longitudinal studies, which 
found that self-reported ST predicted risk of incident diabetes (33). However, a recent study 
of U.S. adults with activity monitor-derived ST which found a significant associations 
between ST (≥1 min) and diabetes in cross sectional analysis, but not in longitudinal 
analysis (i.e., baseline ST did not predict 5 year incident prediabetes or diabetes) (16), 
suggests more research is needed to establish ST as a predictor of metabolic disease.
While few studies have evaluated associations between objectively-measured ST and 
components of the metabolic syndrome, several studies have evaluated associations with 
waist circumference, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, SBP and fasting glucose. The majority 
of studies support unfavorable associations with waist circumference (34-38) and 
triglycerides (5), while evidence of an association with HDL cholesterol is inconclusive (5), 
and evidence of an association with SBP (5;30;34;35;39;40) or fasting plasma glucose (5) is 
lacking. Thus, some of our findings are in agreement with previous work, while others 
conflict with the majority of prior research. Given that several associations with ST differed 
within our study by the minimum duration threshold used to establish ST, it is likely that 
differences in assessment (e.g., waist-worn accelerometer vs. StepWatch) and definitions of 
ST account for at least some of the discrepancies across studies. Differences in control for 
confounders and populations may also contribute to disparate findings.
In line with the study by Kim et al. (15) (described in the introduction), the findings 
presented here suggest a minimum duration of 10 minutes is preferable to 1 or 30 minutes 
for establishing ST, in relation to most measures of cardiometabolic health. For example, in 
the present study both ST ≥1 min and ST ≥10 min, but not ST ≥30 min, were significantly 
associated with metabolic syndrome and some of its components, while ST ≥10 min and ST 
≥30 min, but not ST ≥1 min, were both associated with diabetes. In addition, ST ≥10 min 
had the strongest association with metabolic syndrome, diabetes and waist circumference. A 
potential explanation for this finding is that applying a threshold of ≥30 min to establish ST 
misclassifies a substantial portion of ST that is detrimental to health. Although most studies 
examining activity monitor-derived ST and cardiometabolic health have considered all 
minutes below a specified threshold as SB, a recent study by Healy et. al, examined ST 
<30min and ST ≥30 min separately among adults with overweight/obesity and diabetes (14). 
ST ≥30 min, but not MVPA or ST <30min, was significantly associated with both waist 
circumference and BMI. In addition, isotemporal substitution analysis suggested reducing 
ST ≥30 min while increasing low-intensity PA might result in clinically-meaningful 
decreases in waist circumference and BMI. Meanwhile, neither ST (<30 min or ≥30 min) 
nor MVPA were associated with SBP, DBP, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides or fasting

 glucose. These findings suggest additional work is warranted to refine the minimum 
threshold requirement for ST.
To address the fact that the threshold used to identify MVPA among adults with severe 
obesity in this study (i.e., cadence >80) might have underestimated MVPA, a sensitivity 
analysis was employed which replaced MVPA with minutes at a cadence greater than 60. 
While some associations between ST indices with cardiometabolic outcomes were slightly 
attenuated, most were largely unaffected. Thus, our results imply that cardiometablic health 
of adults with severe obesity might be improved by replacing sedentary behavior with low-
intensity PA, whether defined as a cadence of ≤80 or ≤60.
When interpreting this study's results, several limitations should be considered. First, 
temporal relationships between ST with cardiometabolic health cannot be established from 
this cross sectional analysis. However, establishing associations is an important precursor to 
investment in clinical trials which can test causality. Additionally, study participants were a 
convenience sample of adults undergoing bariatric surgery. While minor differences were 
detected between those included and excluded from the analysis sample, it is unlikely these 
factors influenced the associations evaluated in this report. Finally, the StepWatch, selected 
for its accuracy in measuring PA of adults with severe obesity, was the only activity monitor 
employed in this study. Thus, ST was based on an estimate of time spent not ambulating (i.e. 
generating 0 steps) and did not take posture into account. Future studies should consider 
postural sensors to reduce misclassification.
Major strengths of this study are 1) the large geographically diverse sample; 2) the objective 
assessment of ST, and evaluation of three minimum durations to establish ST; and 3) 
adjustment for both MPVA and BMI, enabling examination of whether ST, over and above 
MVPA and obesity severity, may contribute to poor cardiometabolic health.
Conclusion
Our study demonstrates that ST, independent of MVPA, is associated with several markers 
of cardiometabolic health, among adults with severe obesity prior to bariatric surgery. These 
findings suggest that cardiometabolic health may be improved by replacing sedentary 
behavior with low-intensity PA. Future work should investigate whether intervening on 
sedentary behavior is an effective approach to cardiovascular and metabolic disease 
prevention and management among adults with severe obesity, to inform PA 
recommendations. In addition, this study suggests a minimum duration of 10 minutes may 
be preferable to 1 minute or 30 minutes for identifying ST from activity monitor data, and 
confirms the need for future research to consider duration when defining activity monitor-
derived ST.

•
Sedentary time (ST) is associated with cardiometabolic health of obese adults
•
This is true after control for physical activity and additional confounders
•
The duration threshold for activity monitor-derived ST impacts associations
•
A threshold of 10 minutes may be preferable to 1 minute or 30 minutes
