Evaluation of Quantified Social Perception Circuit Activity
as a Neurobiological Marker of Autism Spectrum Disorder
Malin Björnsdotter, MSc, PhD; Nancy Wang; Kevin Pelphrey; Martha D. Kaiser
IMPORTANCE Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is marked by social disability and is associated
with dysfunction in brain circuits supporting social cue perception. The degree to which
neural functioning reflects individual-level behavioral phenotype is unclear, slowing the
search for functional neuroimaging biomarkers of ASD.
OBJECTIVE To examine whether quantified neural function in social perception circuits may
serve as an individual-level marker of ASD in children and adolescents.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The cohort study was conducted at the Yale Child Study
Center and involved children and adolescents diagnosed as having ASD and typically
developing participants. Participants included a discovery cohort and a larger replication
cohort. Individual-level social perception circuit functioning was assessed as functional
magnetic resonance imaging brain responses to point-light displays of coherent vs scrambled
human motion.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Outcome measures included performance of quantified
brain responses in affected male and female participants in terms of area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity, and correlations between
brain responses and social behavior.
RESULTS Of the 39 participants in the discovery cohort aged 4 to 17 years, 22 had ASD and 30
were boys. Of the 75 participants in the replication cohort aged 7 to 20 years, 37 had ASD and
52 were boys. A relative reduction in social perception circuit responses was identified in
discovery cohort boys with ASD at an AUC of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.52-0.89; P = .01); however,
typically developing girls and girls with ASD could not be distinguished (P = .54). The results
were confirmed in the replication cohort, where brain responses were identified in boys with
ASD at an AUC of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.64-0.91; P < .001) and failed to distinguish affected and
unaffected girls (P = .82). Across both cohorts, boys were identified at an AUC of 0.77 (95%
CI, 0.64-0.86) with corresponding sensitivity and specificity of 76% each. Additionally, brain
responses were associated with social behavior in boys but not in girls.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Quantified social perception circuit activity is a promising
individual-level candidate neural marker of the male ASD behavioral phenotype. Our findings
highlight the need to better understand effects of sex on social perception processing in
relation to ASD phenotype manifestations.

A
utism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a collection of po-
tentially severe childhood neurodevelopmental con-
ditions affecting 1 in 54 boys and 1 in 252 girls.1 Al-
though ASD is characterized by a heterogeneous range of
behavioralsymptoms,includingearly-onsetdifficultiesincom-
munication and restricted repetitive behavior,2 difficulty with
social interaction is a unifying feature of the condition.3
Typically developing (TD) children preferentially attend
topoint-lightdisplaysofbiologicalmotionintheformofamov-
ing human within the first days of life.4 Two- and 3-year-old
children diagnosed as having ASD, however, do not orient to-
ward such point-light displays.5,6 This behavioral deficit re-
mains in affected older children,7,8 adolescents, and young
adults.8-10
Sensitivity to biological motion is underpinned by neural
circuitspreparedtobenefitfromspecies-typicalinput4,11,12and
plays a central role in the development of social engagement6
including the development of emotion perception13 and the
attribution of intentions to others.14 Consistent with the ASD
behavioralphenotype,brainresponsestobiologicalmotionare
reduced in regions supporting social perception, such as the
fusiform gyrus and superior temporal sulcus, in affected
children,15 adolescents, and adults.9,10,16 Moreover, unaf-
fected siblings of children with ASD share regions of dysfunc-
tion with affected children,15,17 suggesting that social percep-
tioncircuitfunctioningmayreflectvulnerabilityratheranacute
clinical behavioral manifestation. Taken together, the litera-
ture points to a pervasive dysfunction in social perception
circuitsassociatedwiththesocialdeficitscharacteristicofASD.
Indeed, dysfunction in brain circuits supporting social per-
ception is among the most replicated functional brain differ-
ences between ASD and TD individuals across experimental
paradigms.18
The identification of biomarkers is a key challenge in
psychiatry.19 Biomarkers can inform diagnosis and progno-
sis, but also improve our understanding of pathogenesis and
pathophysiological mechanisms, predicting disease progres-
sion and monitoring therapy.20 Despite the strong interest in
neuroimaging markers of ASD, the degree to which quanti-
fied neural activity in social perception circuits reflects indi-
vidual-level disorder state is unclear. We previously noted that
the observed reduction in brain responses to biological mo-
tion in affected children may be sufficiently robust to poten-
tially serve as an individual level marker of ASD.21 To exam-
ine the practical usefulness of this putative marker, we
collected and examined brain responses in a larger replica-
tion cohort that included a relatively large number of af-
fected girls (total n = 14).
Methods
Participants
Participants from a discovery cohort15 and a new, replication
cohort were included in the study (Table 1). Written informed
consent was obtained from each participant’
s parent(s) or le-
gal guardian according to the Declaration of Helsinki for a
protocol that was approved by the Yale School of Medicine
Human Investigations Committee. All children had normal or
corrected-to-normal (via magnetic resonance imaging–
compatible glasses) vision. Typically developing children were
excluded based on (1) diagnosed, referred, or suspected ASD,
schizophrenia, or other developmental or psychiatric disor-
der; (2) first- or second-degree relative with diagnosed, re-
ferred, or suspected ASD; (3) an individual education plan for
specialeducationservices,includingspeech/languagetherapy,
occupational therapy, and social skills therapy; (4) clinical
impression suggesting ASD, other developmental delay/
disorder,orpsychiatricdisorderbythehighlyexperiencedmul-
tidisciplinary clinical team in the Child Study Center; (5) total
t > 76 on the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) (discovery co-
hort only); and (6) low or moderately low score on any do-
main of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale–II (discovery
cohort only).
Clinical Measures
Autism spectrum disorder in children was diagnosed by an ex-
pert clinician, whose judgment was informed by the Autism
Diagnostic Observation Schedule22 and the Autism Diagnos-
tic Interview–Revised.23 Cognitive ability was assessed using
the Differential Ability Scale.24 Social behavior was character-
ized using the SRS,25 and, in the discovery cohort, the Vineland
Adaptive Behavior Scale–II.
Participant Matching
To exclude potential effects of cognitive ability differences in
the replication cohort, we created subgroups matched on Dif-
ferentialAbilityScalescores.Wealternatedremovalofthehigh-
est scoring TD male participant and the lowest scoring male
participant with ASD until a group difference t test P > .90 was
obtained (Table 1).
Experimental Design
During scanning, children viewed coherent and scrambled
point-lightdisplaysofanimatedbiologicalmotioncreatedfrom
motion-capture data with 16 different capture points. The co-
herent motion displays (12 individual, 3- to 4-second anima-
tions) featured an unfamiliar adult male actor performing
movement sequences relevant to early childhood experi-
ences such as playing pat-a-cake.6 Twelve scrambled motion
animations were created by randomly selecting 16 points from
Key Points
Question Can quantified neural function in social perception
circuits identify autism spectrum disorder?
Findings In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study that
included 2 independent cohorts with a total of 114 children and
adolescents, social perception circuit activity distinguished boys
with and without autism spectrum disorder at a sensitivity and
specificity of 76% each, whereas girls with and without autism
could not be distinguished.
Meaning Quantified social perception circuit function is a
promising candidate for an individual-level neural marker of the
male autism spectrum disorder behavioral phenotype.

across the 12 different biological motion animations and plot-
ting their trajectories on a black background. Thus, the coher-
ent and scrambled displays contained the same local motion
information, but only the coherent displays contained the
configuration of a person.26 Stimuli were presented using
E-Prime 2.0 software (Psychological Software Tools). Six ran-
domly selected coherent motion clips and 6 randomly cho-
sen scrambled motion clips were presented once each in an
alternating-block design (time per block, 24 seconds). The
experiment began and ended with a 20-second fixation
period (total time, 328 seconds). The movies were presented
without audio. The children were asked to watch the videos
and were reminded to remain still and alert.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data Acquisition
On a Siemens MAGNETOM Tim Trio 3T scanner system,
T1-weighted anatomical images were acquired using an
MPRAGE sequence (repetition time, 1900 milliseconds;
echo time, 2.96 milliseconds; field of view, 256 mm; image
matrix, 256 mm2; voxel size, 1 × 1 × 1 mm; 160 slices). Func-
tional runs consisted of 164 whole-brain functional images
acquired using a single-shot gradient recalled echo planar
pulse sequence sensitive to blood oxygenation level–
dependent contrast (repetition time, 2000 milliseconds;
echo time, 25 milliseconds; flip angle, 60°; field of view, 22
cm; image matrix, 64 mm2; voxel size, 3.4 × 3.4 × 4.0 mm;
34 slices).

Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data Preprocessing
Data were preprocessed with BrainVoyager QX (BrainInnova-
tion). All 10 volumes before the onset of the stimulus event
were discarded to allow for T1 equilibrium. Preprocessing of
the functional data included interleaved slice time correction
using cubic spline interpolation, 3-dimensional motion cor-
rection using trilinear/sinc interpolation, linear trend re-
moval, and temporal high-pass filtering to remove low-
frequency nonlinear drifts. Estimated motion plots and cine
loops were inspected for head motion greater than 2 mm of
translation in any direction or 2° of rotation about any axis. To
reduce potential unspecific effects owing to head motion, we
removedvolumeacquisitionswheremovementbetween2con-
secutive volumes exceeded 1 mm or integrated movement
across 4 volumes exceeded 2 mm. Functional data sets were
coregistered to the Talairach-transformed,27 within-session,
T1-weighted anatomical images.
General Linear Model Analysis
A general linear model analysis was conducted for each par-
ticipant on all voxels within a whole-brain mask defined on the
Montreal Neurological Institute template brain normalized to
Talairach space. Regressors were defined as boxcar functions
with values of 1 during each condition and 0 otherwise, con-
volved with a double-gamma hemodynamic response
function.28 Predictors depicting motion in all 6 parameters
were included as predictors of no interest.
Group-Level Analyses
First, we defined the circuit involved in processing observed
human motion as the set of regions of interest that were sig-
nificantlyactivatedforthecontrast(coherentvsscrambledmo-
tion) in TD children and children with ASD combined. Sec-
ond, a direct group comparison for ASD compared with TD of
the coherent vs scrambled motion contrast was performed to
assess group-level differences. Finally, to examine potential
nonspecific visual effects, such as group differences in attend-
ing to the stimuli, we identified regions of interest associated
with visual attention to movement29 based on the contrast (co-
herent + scrambled motion > baseline) in TD children and
children with ASD combined. The results were assessed at con-
ventional voxelwise uncorrected levels (P < .0001 or P < .01,
as indicated) and corrected for multiple comparisons at the
cluster level through the BrainVoyager QX cluster-level sta-
tisticalthresholdestimatorplugin(1000iterations,α < .05).30,31
All group-level random effects analyses were conducted
in the replication cohort only because group-level differ-
enceshavebeenexaminedinthediscoverycohortpreviously.15
To limit bias toward any group, we performed the analyses in
equal numbers of TD participants and participants with ASD
combined (n = 74). To this end, we excluded 1 randomly se-
lected ASD participant.
Individual-Level Analyses
Individual-level brain responses were assessed as the (coher-
ent > scrambled motion) contrast β values averaged across all
voxels within the set of the biological motion regions of inter-
est. To limit any group-difference bias, we only examined re-
gions of interest defined for the main effect of children with
ASDandTDchildrencombined.Theaverageβvalueswerethen
entered into a receiver operating characteristic curve analy-
sis. We used permutation testing with 10 000 iterations to as-
sess the likelihood of obtaining the results owing to chance.
Theanalysiswasconductedinbothsexescombinedandingirls
and boys only.
Correlation Analysis
We computed the Pearson partial linear correlation coeffi-
cient between average β values in the biological motion per-
ception circuit and SRS scores in TD children and children with
ASD combined, while controlling for age, and assessed P
values under the hypothesis of no correlation against the
1-sided alternative of a nonzero negative correlation. In chil-
dren with ASD, we also examined correlations between
average β values and motion, cognitive ability, and Autism
Diagnostic Observation Schedule22 and the Autism Diagnos-
tic Interview–Revised23 scores.
Results
Replication Cohort Group-Level Analyses
The random effects replication cohort group analysis for (co-
herent > scrambled motion) reproduced well-documented re-
gional activations to biological motion, including large clus-
ters in bilateral fusiform gyri (FG), extending into the posterior
superior temporal sulcus in the right hemisphere, and the
occipital gyrus (n = 74; P < .0001, k > 6; Table 2; Figure, A;
eFigure in the Supplement).32,33
The comparison of TD vs ASD confirmed previously ob-
served hypoactivations in ASD in the right FG, left FG, infe-
rior temporal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, and the left
inferior frontal gyrus (P < .01; k > 17; Table 2).9,10,15,16 We found
no significant results for the ASD > TD contrast.
We found no significant effects in regions associated with
visualattention(eResultsintheSupplement).Thereweresome
group differences in head motion (eResult in the Supple-
ment); however, these likely had limited effects on the re-
sults (eDiscussion in the Supplement).
Reduced Individual-Level Responses in Social Perception
Circuits in Affected Boys
Average biological motion circuit β values for the main effect
of coherent vs scrambled motion and children with ASD and
TD children combined identified individual discovery cohort
ASD cases at a significant area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.51-0.84; P = .02).
However,thiseffectwasdrivenentirelybyboyswhowereiden-
tified at an AUC of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.52-0.89; P = .01), whereas
girls with ASD and TD girls could not be distinguished
(AUC = 0.50; 95% CI, 0.00-1.00; P = .54) (Figure, B-D; Table 3).
These results were confirmed in the replication cohort, where
the AUC was significant in both sexes combined (AUC = 0.66;
95% CI, 0.52-0.78; P = .01), high in boys at (AUC = 0.79; 95%CI,

results could not be explained by group differences in cogni-
tive ability: when matched on Differential Ability Scale scores,
the AUC was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.64-0.95; P < .001). In both co-
horts combined, the overall AUC in boys remained high at 0.77
(95% CI, 0.64-0.86; P < .001) with a sensitivity of 76% and a
specificity of 76%. Neither sample size nor motion explained
the relatively low AUC in girls (eResults and eTables 1-3 in the
Supplement).
Post hoc analyses showed that the right FG and posterior
superior temporal sulcus cluster contributed most in detect-
ing boys with ASD in both the discovery and replication co-
horts with AUCs of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.50-0.89) and 0.79 (95% CI,
0.65-0.90), respectively, closely followed by the left FG, with
AUCs of 0.71 (95% CI, .49-0.87) and 0.75 (95% CI, 0.57-0.87),
respectively (Table 3). No region was significant in girls (all
P > .50).
Association With Social Behavior
We found significant inverse correlations between average
brain activity in the social perception circuit and social behav-
ior difficulties (SRS scores), corrected for age, in discovery co-
hortboys(r = −0.43,P = .01),replicationcohortboys(r = −0.35,
P = .006), and boys of both cohorts combined (r = −0.36,
P = .001). However, in girls, no significant correlations were
identified (all P > .05) (Figure, E). Brain responses did not cor-
relate with cognitive ability, motion, Autism Diagnostic Ob-
servation Schedule, or Autism Diagnostic Interview–Revised
in any group (all P > .10).
Discussion
A simple 1-value measure of neural activity in social percep-
tion circuits identified boys affected by ASD with sensitivity
and specificity of 76% across 2 cohorts; however, affected and
TD girls could not be distinguished. Our results suggest that
previously observed group-level hypoactivations in social per-
ception brain regions are sufficiently robust and consistent to
serve as a promising individual-level neural marker of social
deficits associated with ASD in boys.
Social Perception in ASD
Impaired responses to social stimuli characterize the ASD be-
havioral phenotype and are among the most reproduced func-
tional brain differences.3,18 The literature is largely based on
studies in males, however, and our results support a poten-
tial sexually dimorphic neural reflection of the condition.
Whether the observed sex differences are a consequence of
methodological issues, such as relatively low number of girls
or dissimilar disorder manifestations, is unclear. Neverthe-
less, posterior superior temporal sulcus responses to socioaf-
fective stimuli increase in magnitude with age in TD girls but
not in boys,34 suggesting an effect of sex in the development
of social perception processing. Such differences in develop-
mental patterns may also contribute to the lack of correlation
between brain responses and SRS scores in girls. Further stud-
ies examining larger samples of girls diagnosed as having ASD
and other disorders sharing sociocognitive behavioral pheno-
types (eg, anorexia nervosa35) are required to elucidate the un-
derlying mechanisms.
Methodological Issues and Limitations
By extracting only the average brain response from a pre-
defined region of interest, we alleviated the problem of be-
tween-participantsvoxel-to-voxelmapping,whichmaybepar-
ticularly detrimental in groups of varying head size.
Nevertheless, more sophisticated approaches, eg, allowing si-
multaneous inclusion of regional responses across multiple
brain regions, are likely to further improve both the power and
robustness of the marker.
Our participants were not matched on cognitive ability.
However, the results in a matched subsample of boys did not
differ compared with the unmatched full sample, and β val-
uesdidnotcorrelatewithDifferentialAbilityScalescores.Thus,
brain responses to biological motion may be a robust marker
in boys of varying cognitive ability. Similarly, we did not limit
heterogeneity resulting from varying head sizes, ages, and pu-
berty; factors that when appropriately accounted for may im-
prove the sensitivity and specificity of the proposed marker.
Finally, we did not exclude replication cohort children on the
basis of social behavior alone: the replication cohort in-

with low SRS scores, resulting in an overlap between the 2
groups (Figure, E and F). Recognizing the phenotypic hetero-
geneity in both ASD and typical development, we allowed for
a potentially more challenging but also more realistic task of
identifying individual children fulfilling the criteria for ASD.
We did not examine participants’eye movements or di-
rectly control for nonspecific effects related to visual atten-
tion. The lack of eye tracking is a potentially severe limitation
because the broad alterations in visual attention associated
with ASD36 may have contributed to social perception circuit
hypoactivations. However, unaffected and affected partici-
pants did not differ in brain responses in visual attention re-
gions, so it is unlikely that any unspecific visual attention defi-
cits contributed significantly to the performance of the
proposed marker.
Usefulness of a Functional Biomarker
The proposed marker fulfills proposed criteria for neuroim-
aging-based biomarkers (eDiscussion the Supplement).

Nevertheless,theintensesearchforaviableASDbiomarkerhas
hitherto been largely fruitless,37 and the heterogeneous na-
ture of the condition likely renders identification of a single di-
agnostic marker intractable.38 A growing body of studies have
highlightedthepromiseofresting-statefunctionalbrainimaging
in developing candidate biomarkers of autism.39,40 The pro-
posed marker may complement such markers by providing a
quantified measure of evoked social perception circuit func-
tionality.Brainfunctionisactivelyshapedthroughoutlifeinan
intricate interplay between genetics and the environment, and
a functional marker may be used to monitor these plastic
processes and to guide interventions targeted to improve
function in specific circuits via behavioral treatments41 and
pharmacological challenges.42
Conclusions
Functional markers are crucial in charting brain developmen-
tal trajectories and for early detection of deviations in vulner-
able groups. A functional biomarker may be able to detect
associated neural deviations before behavioral changes oc-
cur.Infact,theproposedparadigmtargetslow-levelsocialper-
ception stimuli relevant to all stages of development: 2-day-
old infants preferentially attend to point-light displays of
biological motion,4 and the posterior temporal cortex
responds to social cues within days after birth.11 Moreover,
infants and toddlers at risk for ASD show early-stage atypi-
cal behavioral and neural responses.43-45 Consequently,
quantified function of social brain circuits should be a
promising candidate neural marker of ASD across all age
groups. The Yale Child Study group is committed to study-
ing brain responses in young patients and control children,
with designated facilities such as a mock scanner. Nonethe-
less, recognizing the challenges associated with scanning
younger children, we are studying responses to biological
motion using functional near infrared spectroscopy in tod-
dlers. The present finding of robust individual-level differ-
ences pave the road toward refined studies specifically tar-
geting such early neural markers.
