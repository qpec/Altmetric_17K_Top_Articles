Abstract
Menopause, the permanent cessation of ovulation, occurs in humans well before the end of
the expected lifespan, leading to an extensive post-reproductive period which remains a
puzzle for evolutionary biologists. All human populations display this particularity; thus, it is
difficult to empirically evaluate the conditions for its emergence. In this study, we used artifi-
cial neural networks to model the emergence and evolution of allocation decisions related to
reproduction in simulated populations. When allocation decisions were allowed to freely
evolve, both menopause and extensive post-reproductive life-span emerged under some
ecological conditions. This result allowed us to test various hypotheses about the required
conditions for the emergence of menopause and extensive post-reproductive life-span. Our
findings did not support the Maternal Hypothesis (menopause has evolved to avoid the risk
of dying in childbirth, which is higher in older women). In contrast, results supported a shared
prediction from the Grandmother Hypothesis and the Embodied Capital Model. Indeed, we
found that extensive post-reproductive lifespan allows resource reallocation to increase fer-
tility of the children and survival of the grandchildren. Furthermore, neural capital develop-
ment and the skill intensiveness of the foraging niche, rather than strength, played a major
role in shaping the age profile of somatic and cognitive senescence in our simulated popula-
tions. This result supports the Embodied Capital Model rather than the Grand-Mother
Hypothesis. Finally, in simulated populations where menopause had already evolved, we
found that reduced post-reproductive lifespan lead to reduced children’s fertility and grand-
children’s survival. The results are discussed in the context of the evolutionary emergence
of menopause and extensive post-reproductive life-span.
Author summary
In all human populations, regardless of environmental and socioeconomic conditions,
menopause occurs in women well before the end of their expected lifespan. Conversely,
extensive post-reproductive life-span is rare in other species; except in some cetaceans.

 Evolutionary theory predicts that menopause and extensive post-reproductive lifespan
should emerge and persist in populations only if it is advantageous for gene transmission.
Identifying this advantage is a long-standing issue. We provide a better understanding by
demonstrating that humans’ cognitive abilities, in association with grand-mothering, are
required for the emergence of this pattern. Indeed, cognitive abilities allow accumulation
of skills and experience over the lifespan, thus providing an advantage for resource acqui-
sition. These surplus resources can then be used to increase the number of offspring or be
transmitted to existing offspring and grandoffspring. Stopping reproduction during aging
allows allocating more resources to assist offspring and grandoffspring, thus increasing
children’s fertility and grandchildren’s survival.
Introduction
Menopause, the permanent cessation of ovulation, occurs in women well before the end of
their expected lifespan; reproductive senescence occurs substantially earlier than somatic
senescence, leading to a particularly long post-reproductive life [1]. This is a rather uniform
pattern across traditional and modern human societies. For example, if a man or a woman
reaches age 45, he or she can expect to live at least an additional two decades [2–5]. However,
and remarkably consistently across populations, reproductive senescence in women is largely
completed by age 45 [6]. Extensive post-reproductive life-span (PRLS) in humans is thus not a
consequence of modern improvements to nutrition, hygiene or medicine. Rather, reproduc-
tive cessation occurring approximately twenty years before the end of the expected lifespan
appears as a constant feature of human biology [5, 7]. Among other species, only pilot and
killer whales also exhibit extensive female PRLS. For instance, female killer whales can live into
the 90s although they usually stop reproducing around age 40 [8–10]. However, patterns of
reproductive and somatic senescence in killer whales differ from those of humans in some
other ways, especially for males. Indeed, males rarely live beyond 50 years. Moreover, they do
not undergo reproductive cessation [11]. In contrast, observations in traditional human popu-
lations have suggested that men may often undergo reproductive cessation once their wives
reach menopause [12].
Understanding the conditions involved in the evolution of menopause and extensive PRLS
is a long-standing challenge for biologists. First, an early end to reproduction seems contrary
to maximizing Darwinian fitness. Second, the selective advantage associated with long life
after the end of reproduction is not trivial. Various hypotheses have been proposed (for a
review see [13]), including the Maternal hypothesis (MH), the Grand-mother Hypothesis
(GMH), and the Embodied capital model (ECM). The MH is the idea that menopause has
evolved in humans to avoid the risk of dying at childbirth, which is higher in older women,
and to ensure the survival of the last offspring [14,15]. This hypothesis might thus explain why
ageing women stop reproduction. However, as it relies on costs but not on benefits, the MH
seems unlikely to explain alone the particularly long duration of PRLS observed in women.
Indeed, whereas age-related costs of reproduction may explain early end of reproduction, it
cannot explain why additional life after reproduction may be advantageous. Furthermore,
death in childbirth may not be common enough to constitute a sufficient cost [16]. According
to GMH [7] and ECM [12], both menopause and long life after reproduction may have evolved
as two parts of the same allocation strategy consisting of ceasing to allocate resources to direct
reproduction (i.e. producing new children) to favor indirect reproduction (i.e parental or
grandparental care). Indeed, menopause and extensive PRLS may allow additional resource

 allocation to grandoffspring care and, therefore, increased fertility of the children and survival
of the grandchildren. There are two main differences between the GMH and the ECM. The
first resides in the specific causal hypotheses involved [17]. Indeed, according to the GMH,
strength (e.g. proxied by body size) is the primary determinant of resource production [18–
21]. Children productivity is low because foraging requires strength. As human growth is par-
ticularly slow, benefit of grand-mothering for grand-children survival and fertility is high, gen-
erating selection for older women to increase longevity [21]. According to the ECM, neural
capital development and the skill intensiveness of the human foraging niche play the major
role in shaping the age profile of resource production and transfers. In traditional societies, a
peak of resource production is reached approximately twenty years after the peak of strength
(mid-twenties) [12]. This is because earlier-life investments in neural capital lead to later-life
energetic returns from such investments, with the consequences that individuals still acquire
more resources than they need for survival until age 70 [12]. These extra resources could be
used either for direct reproduction or for indirect reproduction. However, if the cost of repro-
duction increases with age (for instance, due to physiological constraints), it may be more
advantageous to use these resources for increasing condition and fertility of the children and
grandchildren, rather than increasing the number of children. The second difference between
GMH and ECM resides in the fact the ECM is a two-sex model, whereas males may not be
considered in the GMH. Indeed, as the traditional hunter-gatherer pattern of production,
reproduction, and parental investment depends fundamentally on a cooperative division of
labor between men and women, the ECM predicts that both aging women and men may stop
producing new children to allocate resources to existing children and grand-children.
To test the MH [22, 23] and the GMH [24, 25], empirical studies have compared the fitness
of children and grandchildren of women who experienced different durations of post-repro-
ductive life-span. However, it is unclear if these studies help to understand the emergence or
maintenance of menopause and extensive PRLS [26]. Indeed, the conditions favoring their
maintenance are not the same as the conditions favoring their emergence. This is because
female reproductive strategies in a population alter the social environment and determine the
benefits of a trait. This change affects competition for reproductive resources and the average
relatedness between interacting individuals [26]. Thus, the evolution of menopause and PRLS
should not be studied outside of its ecological context or without considering the feedback
between the evolution of this trait and the resulting ecology. To empirically study the evolu-
tionary emergence of extensive PRLS, the fitness of rare mutant females who experience meno-
pause should be compared to the fitness of resident females who do not. However, this is a
possibility neither in humans, as menopause and extensive PRLS is already present in all popu-
lations [26], nor in our closest relative species, as reproductive senescence in midlife seems to
be absent in non-human primates [27]. Regarding the ECM, the prediction that both aging
women and men may stop producing new children to allocate resources to existing children
and grand-children has been already supported by observations in traditional human popula-
tions [12]. However, the relation between neural capital development and skill intensiveness of
the foraging niche on the one hand, and the duration of PRLS on the other hand, have not
been demonstrated yet.
Here, we tested the MH, GMH and ECM for both the emergence and the persistence of
menopause and extensive PRLS using a modeling approach based on life-history theory. Life
history theory is the idea that living organisms must divide the total energetic potential avail-
able to them over their lifetime to perform different tasks, mainly survival, growth, direct
reproduction, and parental care [28, 29]. As this energetic potential is limited, trade-offs occur
among these tasks, resulting in different life-history strategies. The first trade-off occurs
between immediate and future reproduction (via investment in growth and survival). The

 second trade-off occurs between the quantity and quality of offspring (i.e., having more offspring
versus a larger investment in each of them). Modeling the evolution of allocation strategies
should allow investigating the conditions for a switch from allocation to direct reproduction to
allocation to indirect reproduction, i.e. for the emergence and persistence of both menopause
and extensive PRLS. However, it requires a comprehensive model that considers both all of the
allocation decisions that an individual has to make during his or her life, and how these decisions
are shaped by complex interactions between genes, environment, and the internal state of the
individual at the time when he has to make the decision.
We used Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs [30]) to simulate the evolution of resource allo-
cation strategies, including all types of complex, even unforeseen, trade-offs in populations
subject to diverse ecological conditions. Allocation decisions were allowed to freely evolve, and
menopause and extensive PRLS emerged under some ecological conditions. We then tested
for the following predictions: (1) Under the MH, menopause (and thus extensive PRLS) should
not be observed without including age-dependent risk of dying at childbirth in the model; (2)
Under both the GMH and the ECM, menopause and extensive PRLS should not emerge, what-
ever the ecological conditions, if resource transfers to grand-offspring are not allowed; (3)
Under the ECM only, cognitive resources, because of delayed benefits of investment in neural
development, should be a required condition for the emergence of menopause and extensive
PRLS. Note that the ECM, as mentioned before, also predicts that both aging women and men
may stop producing new children to allocate resources to existing children and grand-chil-
dren, a prediction which has been supported by observations in traditional human populations
[12]. Due to methodological issues (see limitation section), we did not test this prediction here.
We rather focused on the relation between cognitive resources and extensive PRLS, which has
never been tested before. Finally, we also tested whether MH, GMH and ECM may explain the
persistence of extensive PRLS in simulated populations where this trait has already evolved. In
these populations, GMH predicts that mother death at the age of menopause or delayed meno-
pause of the mother should lead to decreased fertility of the children and/or decreased grand-
children survival. MH predicts that, under the same conditions, survival of the children should
be decreased.
Results
1. Multiple and complex interactions among the ecological parameters
shape the duration of PRLS in simulated populations
With the exception of the flow rate of available resources, all of the ecological parameters
included in the model (α, the skill intensiveness of the foraging niche; β, the rate of skills acqui-
sition; γ2, the difficulty of acquiring resources in the environment; δ, the depletion rate of
somatic and cognitive capital; and σ2, the dangerousness of the environment) somehow influ-
enced the duration of PRLS (Fig 1). Lower values for α were associated with shorter PRLS
regardless of the values of the other parameters. However, high values of α were not always suf-
ficient to generate a duration of PRLS higher than 5 time units, suggesting the presence of
interactions with other parameters. The highest durations of PRLS observed (>5 time units)
were associated with parameters of intermediate (for β) or high values (for δ and γ2), suggest-
ing multiple complex interactions among them.
2. Evolution of life history traits
The maximization procedure confirmed that at least one combination of ecological parameters
(α = 0.91; β = 0.47; γ2 = 157; δ = 0.87; σ2 = 27) lead to menopause and extensive PRLS with our

 model. Among all tested combinations of parameters (see Material and method section), this
set, referred to as EP�, led to evolution of the longest duration of PRLS in the simulated popu-
lation. With EP�, 1,121 individuals were born and died during the final 2,000 time units of the
simulation process. Their average duration of PRLS was 21.92 (+/- 3.04) time units. A total of
78.1% of these individuals had exactly the same allocation strategy (S1 Fig), as defined by the
combination of synaptic weights of the artificial neural network (see the Material and Methods
section). Their average duration of PRLS was 18.84 (+/- 0.60). The typical life history of an
individual with this allocation strategy achieving reproduction was the following (Fig 2): The
first resource allocation was to growth, survival and maintenance until the quantity of somatic
capital reached the value of 0.6 (at t = 18). Then, the first reproductive event occurred and
somatic senescence started, thus suggesting that resources were allocated to reproduction at
the expense of investment in the quality of somatic capital. Investment in maternal care for a

random value was attributed to each of the five ecological parameters (α, β and δ were drawn from a uniform
distribution between 0 and 1 and γ2 and σ2 from a uniform distribution between 0 and 200), and a simulated
population with an initial size of 1,000 individuals was allowed to evolve during 10,000 time units. The duration
of PRLS was then measured as the average time interval between the last reproductive event and death,
calculated over the individuals who were born and died during the final 2,000 units of time. This process was
repeated 100 times to detect the influence of each parameter on the variation of the duration of PRLS.

 given child was maximal following birth and then decreased over time. A second reproductive
event occurred at t = 28, again at the expense of the quality of somatic capital. At t = 32, a
grandchild was born. Then, the individual started to allocate resources for maternal care for
both the first child, who has given birth, and the second child, who is not autonomous yet. The
resulting increase in maternal care occurred at the expense of the quality of somatic capital but
also at the expense of investment in direct reproduction. Indeed, no individual along the simu-
lation process gave birth to an additional child after the birth of a grandchild. Despite the
decrease of the quality of somatic capital, the quality of both cognitive capital and survival
probability remained stable until t = 42. Then, they started to decrease until death, which
occurred at t = 47.
3. Grand-mothering and cognitive resources are required for the
emergence of menopause and extensive PRLS
Whatever the ecological parameters used, menopause and extensive PRLS did not emerge in
the simulated populations when grandoffspring care was not allowed. In that case, the mean
duration of PRLS obtained after applying the maximization procedure was 1.6 time units, a
92.6% reduction compared to the mean duration of PRLS (21.9 time units) obtained when
grand-mothering was a possible option. Similarly, menopause and extensive PRLS did not
emerge when cognitive resources were not differentiated from somatic resources in the model
(i.e. both resources are interchangeable and had the same properties, including no delayed

 benefits). In that case, the mean duration of PRLS obtained after applying the maximization
procedure was 2.1 time units, a 90.6% reduction compared to the mean duration of PRLS
obtained with the full model. Finally, allowing resource transfers between siblings lead to no
substantial changes in the results (duration of the PRLS of 22.04 with the full model, 1.71 with-
out grand-mothering, and 2.03 without delayed benefit of investment in cognition).
4. Cost analysis
In populations where menopause and extensive PRLS had already evolved, condition 1 (death
at the age of menopause) had no detectable effect on the survival of the first-generation chil-
dren (G1), although these children had reduced fertility. In the subsequent generations, the
survival and fertility of the manipulated individuals with condition 1 were lower than the con-
trol (Fig 3) and they decreased in frequency (Fig 4). Manipulated individuals with condition 2
(delayed menopause, i.e. one additional reproductive event at the age of menopause) were sig-
nificantly more frequent in the population than control individuals at G1, which was expected
given the nature of the condition. Then, they decreased in frequency and were significantly
less frequent than the control individuals from G5 to G10 (Fig 4). The probability to survive
until reproduction was significantly lower for the manipulated individuals with condition 2
than for the control individuals, from G1 to G10. At G1, this difference was explained by a low
probability of survival (0.23) for the last child, who was born at the mother’s expected age of
menopause. Conversely, the other children had a probability of surviving until reproduction
of 0.48, which is equal to those of the control individuals. The fertility of the manipulated indi-
viduals with condition 2 was significantly higher than that of the control individuals at G0, as
expected given the nature of the condition. Then, however, fertility of the manipulated individ-
uals was not significantly different from that of the control individuals from G1 to G10 (Fig 5).
Finally, the lifespan of the manipulated individuals with condition 2 was significantly shorter
than that of control individuals (on average 42 units of time rather than 47, p-value: 0.003).
Discussion
1. Multiple and complex interactions among ecological parameters
shape the duration of PRLS in simulated populations
Studying the correlations between the ecological parameters used for the simulations and the
resulting duration of PRLS revealed that high values of α (i.e. skill intensiveness of the ecologi-
cal niche) were necessary to generate duration of PRLS higher than 5 time units. This result
supports the ECM [12]. However, high values of α were not sufficient to generate a duration of
PRLS higher than 5 time units, suggesting the presence of complex interactions with other
parameters. Therefore, studying the correlations between ecological parameters and the result-
ing duration of PRLS was insufficient to clearly understand the conditions favoring the emer-
gence of menopause and extensive PRLS. We thus used the maximization procedure to
investigate the evolution of life history traits in the simulated populations and to identify
required conditions for emergence of menopause and extensive PRLS.
2. Evolution of life history traits
When allocation decisions were allowed to freely evolve in a simulated population, menopause
and extensive PRLS emerged under at least one set of ecological parameters (Fig 2). The patterns
of somatic and reproductive senescence obtained were strikingly similar in some ways to those
observed in traditional human populations [12]. In particular, we observed a cognitive senes-
cence beginning about twenty units of time after somatic senescence, and stable productivity

 until cognitive senescence begins. In contrast, some other characteristics of the evolved strategy
were less realistic when compared to observations in traditional human populations (e.g. number
of offspring per individual, inter-birth intervals, see Fig 2). However, note that we did not aim
here to simulate precisely all the aspects of a human life-cycle. Indeed, there are substantial dif-
ferences in the timing of life-history between human populations around the world, and all
this variability cannot be captured here. Moreover, there is no indication that the trait values
observed now in hunter-gatherers (mainly living in marginal habitats), reflect the values in the
ancestral hunter-gatherers, at a time when menopause evolved. For these reasons, we have

strategy. At t = 10,000, we applied condition 1 (death at time of menopause) to half of the individuals in each
population, and then to their offspring at each generation. No condition was applied to the other individuals
(control). This figure represents the proportion of individuals who survive until reproduction and the average
fertility among the individuals receiving the condition, compared to control. Results were averaged and the
standard error was calculated over the 100 populations. Significance was assessed using two-sided student
tests (R-based function t-test).

 designed the maximization procedure to optimize the ecological parameters in order to obtain
the longest PRLS under various simulated conditions. This approach allowed us to identify some
factors which are required for the emergence of extensive PRLS, whatever the ecological parame-
ters used, the species considered, and the other characteristics of the allocation strategy. An
advantage from this approach is that our findings apply to any species with menopause and
extensive PRLS, not only humans. Another is that we assumed a minimal number of physiologi-
cal or environmental constraints.
In particular, menopause and extensive PRLS evolved without imposing a starting condi-
tion with the presence of a somatic senescence. Rather, somatic senescence, reproductive
senescence (i.e. menopause) and extensive PRLS evolved as an allocation strategy. Similarly, no
prior assumption was made on an increase of the cost of direct reproduction with age. To
explain reproductive senescence, MH assumes that the cost of direct reproduction increases
with age due to the higher risk of dying at childbirth [14, 15]. ECM also assumes increasing
costs of reproduction due to physiological constraints (e.g. decreasing oocyte quality), although
Kaplan et al. [12] recognized that additional costs to late-life reproduction beyond physiological

simulated 200 populations using the EP* and best synaptic weights, without allowing mutation. 100 populations
were attributed to condition 1 (death at the age of menopause), and 100 populations were attributed to condition 2
(one additional reproductive event at the age of menopause). At t = 10,000, we applied condition 1 or 2 to half of
the individuals in each population. The condition was heritable and was also applied to their offspring at each
generation. No condition was applied to the other individuals and their offspring (control). This figure represents the
proportion of individuals who received the condition among the successive generations (up to the 10th). Proportions
were averaged over populations attributed to condition 1 (black bars), and condition 2 (grey bars). Departure from
the expected frequency (0.5) was tested for each condition and generation using two-sided binomial tests (R-based
function binom.test), and demonstrate that the condition represents a cost for fitness.

 costs (e.g. reduced future productivity from maternal depletion) may exist. Here, the cost of
direct reproduction is only defined by the amount of resources allocated for direct reproduction
and for parental care, which are allowed to freely evolve. However, when individuals were
forced to reproduce at the age of menopause, their own lifespan was significantly reduced, and
the child had a higher probability of dying before achieving reproduction, compared to previous
children. Late reproduction is thus costly for survival and weakly advantageous for gene trans-
mission, as assumed by MH and ECM. However, this is a result of an evolved allocation strategy
rather than the consequence of pre-existing physiological constraints. Similarly, mortality was
only a probabilistic consequence of a reduced quantity of resources invested in survival.

strategy. At t = 10,000, we applied condition 2 (one additional reproductive event at time of menopause) to
half of the individuals in each population, and then to their offspring at each generation. No condition was
applied to the other individuals (control). This figure represents the proportion of individuals who survive until
reproduction and the average fertility among the individuals receiving the condition, compared to control.
Results were averaged and the standard error was calculated over the 100 populations. Significance was

 Extrinsic mortality was not included in the model, as it can be considered that evolved organ-
isms exert some control over many possible causes of mortality (e.g., by altering patterns of
travel to avoid predators, by investing in immune functions, etc.; see [31]). Most types of mor-
tality could thus be seen as the result of an allocation strategy.
3. Grand-mothering and skill intensiveness of the ecological niche are
required for the emergence of menopause and extensive PRLS
Investigating how patterns of reproductive senescence were shaped by the evolution of alloca-
tion decisions under different simulated conditions allowed us to test three hypotheses (MH,
GMH and ECM) for the emergence and the persistence of menopause and extensive PRLS. By
supporting key assumptions from the GMH and ECM (but not the MH), our results support
the idea that both grand-mothering (GMH) and cognitive resources (ECM) are required for
the emergence of menopause and extensive PRLS.
Maternal hypothesis.
The MH assumes that the risk of maternal mortality (defined as
mortality during childbirth) associated with late reproduction represents a cost (for the sur-
vival of existing children, which would be deprived of maternal investment) that is higher than
stopping direct reproduction, contributing to the emergence of menopause [14,15]. Here, MH
thus predicts that menopause should not evolve without assuming that the risk of dying at
childbirth increases with age. However, at least one set of ecological parameters led to meno-
pause in our simulations in the absence of this assumption. Thus, according to our results, the
MH is not a pivotal factor for menopause to emerge, as the risk of dying with a new childbirth
was not a selective force to stop reproducing. Maternal mortality during childbirth is minimal
in non-human primates [32] and thus probably also in humans during the emergence of men-
opause. It is therefore possible that the relatively high maternal mortality during childbirth in
humans is only a derived condition, occurring during or after the emergence of menopause,
rather than a determinant of menopause.
Grandmother hypothesis.
The GMH assumes that the reproductive costs of stopping
direct reproduction are outweighed by grand-mothering, i.e., the increase of fecundity of the
children and survival of the grand-children by specific resource allocation. This hypothesis has
been supported by a comparative analysis of birth intervals in mammals; the birth interval in
humans is shorter than expected for their size, a possible result of the effect of grandmothers
on the fertility of their daughters [7]. In our model, grand-parenting was no longer a resource
allocation possibility when investment in a child who already reproduced was set to 0 (see
material and method section). The GMH thus predicts that menopause and extensive PRLS
would not emerge under these conditions whatever the ecological parameters used, whereas
both should emerge under at least some ecological conditions when grand-mothering is
allowed. As the results were consistent with this prediction, this study supports the idea that
grand-mothering is a required condition for the emergence of menopause and extensive
PRLS.
Embodied capital model. Our finding that grand-parenting is a required condition for
the emergence of extensive PRLS was expected in the contexts of both the GMH and the ECM.
However, ECM uniquely predicts that cognitive resources, because of the delayed benefits of
investing in brain performance [12], may also be required. Here, according to the ECM, we
expected that menopause and extensive PRLS should not emerge without including these
delayed benefits in the model, whatever the model parameters used. Results were consistent
with this prediction. In addition to grand-mothering, delayed benefits of investment are thus a
required condition for the emergence of extensive PRLS. This finding strongly supports the
idea that the skill intensiveness of the ecological niche and the importance of cognitive abilities

 in determining productivity in humans may have allowed for the emergence of extensive
PRLS. Indeed, cognitive resources are characterized by strong delayed benefits of investment,
as investing in neural development at time t promotes accumulation of skills and experience
all along the life [12]. However, the ECM as described by Kaplan et al. [12] assumed that the
cost of direct reproduction increases over age due to physiological constraints (e.g., diminish-
ing oocyte quality). In non-human primates, it is not clear if the cost of direct reproduction
increases with age. For example, an increase of birth interval with age (e.g., in chimpanzees
[33]) could be explained by a decreasing somatic ability to extract energy from the environ-
ment and a constant cost of direct reproduction; in baboons, there are (non-significant) indi-
cations that offspring of the highest parity (oldest) mothers may be at a slight disadvantage
[34]. It is thus unclear from studies of wild non-human primates if an increase in the cost of
direct reproduction with age is an ancestral or a derived condition. Regardless, we went further
here by demonstrating that this assumption was not needed here for the emergence of meno-
pause and extensive PRLS. Interestingly, the ECM also predicts that selection favors a minimal
decrease of cognitive performance with age, compared to physical condition, and this alloca-
tion strategy is clearly present in the simulated populations (Fig 2). A very late cognitive senes-
cence has been observed in forager-farmers, in particular for semantic fluency [35], and has
been confirmed by a genomic study reporting a genetic signature of past selection for persis-
tent cognitive competence at post-reproductive ages in humans [36].
4. Cost analysis
We also support the importance of GMH, but not MH, in explaining the persistence of exten-
sive PRLS in populations where this trait has already evolved. Indeed, in a population where
extensive PRLS had already evolved, when maternal mortality was enforced at the age of men-
opause (i.e., on average 4.3 time units after the second childbirth), the children’s fertility was
affected, but not their survival until reproduction (Fig 3). This non-reduced survival of moth-
erless children did not result from allocare [37], as children without their mother could not
receive resources from other individuals. Rather, it was the result of an evolved strategy con-
sisting in prioritizing survival rather than fertility when facing a lack of resources. In contrast,
grand-mothering is likely pivotal to maintain extensive post-reproductive life-span once it has
evolved. Indeed, when the grand-mothering effect was suppressed at the age of menopause
(the grandmother was forced to die) or reduced (the grandmother was forced to have an addi-
tional child so that parental resources were reduced for any given child), this was associated
with a reduced fitness and the corresponding strategy decreased in frequency (Figs 3 and 5).
This is consistent with several empirical studies [23–25, 28–42].
5. Limitations and perspectives
The main limitations in this study were due to the use of a one-sex model. Up to now, no vali-
dated and reliable method has been published to use neural networks in the context of a two-
sex diploid model. We hope that further methodological developments will allow overcoming
this limitation in the near future. It would make possible to complement this study by testing
another key prediction of the ECM, i.e. both aging women and men may stop producing new
children to reallocate resources to existing children and grand-children. Note however that
this prediction has been already supported by observations in traditional populations [12]. In
contrast, the relation between cognitive resources and duration of the PRLS had not been pre-
viously tested. Using a two-sex model would have also allowed testing the reproductive conflict
hypothesis [23, 39, 43]. The idea is that, when old and young women are co-breeding in the
same family unit, as in patrilocal societies, menopause could be the result of a limitation in

 resources due to competition. Relatedly, some authors suggested that, in this context of intra-
familial competition, younger females should benefit from a decisive advantage as compared
to older females [25,43,44] due to asymmetric relatedness. Indeed, the daughter-in-law is not
related to the children of her mother-in-law, but the mother-in-law is related to the children of
her daughter-in-law. Testing of these hypotheses require using a two-sex model, as they are
explicitly based on relatedness within a family. Therefore, it cannot be excluded here that these
processes, in addition with grand-mothering and cognitive resources, may have also played a
role in the emergence or persistence of menopause and extensive PRLS in humans.
More generally, future developments may be envisaged to make the model more realistic.
For instance, this may include taking into account migration and patterns of patri or matri-
locality (i.e. the individuals can invest for their kin only if they are co-resident), modelling
resource transfers between non-kin or distant kin, considering separately different kind of
resources (e.g. time and energy), or allowing different degradation rates for somatic and cogni-
tive capital. Indeed, in the absence of any published evidence that the respective degradation
rates of somatic and cognitive capital are different, for the sake of simplicity, we assumed that
these two rates are equal. Note that we speak here of physiological degradation rates, which are
different from observed rates of decrease in performance. Indeed, there is published evidence
that age-related decline in physical strength follows a very different trajectory than age-related
decline in various cognitive abilities [35, 45]. However, age-related decline in performance
depends both on the physiological degradation rate and on investment in maintenance. Finally,
we assumed here a maximum of five children living simultaneously. This assumption was also
imposed by computational limits. However, this is unlikely to have affected the results, as no
individuals gave birth to more than three children in our simulated populations using the EP�
parameters.
To conclude, we hope to stimulate further interest to use artificial neural networks (or any
other adequate tool) to study the evolution of allocation decisions to address these questions,
as well as many other issues in evolutionary biology. Indeed, allocation decisions are central to
various long-standing questions in this field (e.g., the evolution of senescence, cognition, social
interactions,. . .), and modelling their evolution may result in significant improvement.
Materials and methods
1. Model description
The model (Fig 6) was coded in C++. The neural networks were fully connected multi-layer
perceptrons with a single hidden layer of 5 neurons. The inputs to the networks were informa-
tion on the internal state and social environment perceived by the individual. The outputs
were the proportions of resources allocated to each function.
Input neurons.
Each individual had 14 input neurons (plus a bias neuron, whose value is
always 1). Each of them provided distinct information to the individual about her own current
state (inputs 1–4) or social environment (inputs 5–14), as follows:
Input 1. Quantity of somatic capital: Somatic capital corresponds to all of the organized
somatic tissues (muscles, digestive organs, etc.) that compose an individual, except those asso-
ciated with cognitive functions [25]. Input 2. Quality of somatic capital: Quality is to be under-
stood here as cell quality. As maintaining many cells is costly, the quality of the somatic capital
depletes over time proportionally to its quantity. We expressed the quality of somatic capital at
time t as the proportion (ranging from 0 to 1, with 0 = zero percent and 1 = one hundred per-
cent) of somatic capital which was not degraded. Input 3. Quantity of cognitive capital: Cogni-
tive capital is composed of the tissues associated with cognitive functions (i.e., the brain [43]).
Input 4. Quality of cognitive capital: Quality of cognitive capital is a similar concept to the

 quality of somatic capital, applied to the tissues associated with cognitive functions. Inputs 5 to
9. Children: The number of children was coded as one binary input per child (0: non-existent/
1: existent), with a maximum of five children living simultaneously. Inputs 10 to 14. Productiv-
ity of each child: The children’s productivities were also determined by one input per child.
Productivity quantifies the ability of an individual to extract resources in the environment (see
the “procedure” section). To consider the existence of grandchildren, inputs corresponding to
productivities of each child were corrected by their own number of children (i.e., divided by
the number of children, plus one to avoid divisions by zero).
Hidden neurons and synaptic weights.
Connections between input and hidden neurons
and between hidden and output neurons represent value modifications (activation), via activa-
tion functions. Each output neuron is connected to each hidden neuron and its value after acti-
vation is the total of the activations received from each hidden neuron. The activation functions
were logistical functions using as parameters a set of values called synaptic weights. The combi-
nation of synaptic weights of one simulated individual determined its allocation strategy. At the
start of each simulated population, the synaptic weights were randomly assigned for each indi-
vidual from a uniform distribution ranging between -10 and 10.
Output neurons.
Each individual had 11 output neurons, which represented the propor-
tion of the resources obtained at time t which are allocated for each of the following functions:
output 1: somatic growth, output 2: somatic maintenance, output 3: cognitive improvement, out-
put 4: cognitive maintenance, output 5: survival, output 6: direct reproduction, and outputs 7 to
11: maternal care for each child. Outputs were normalized to obtain a total of 1.
Initial state. At time t = 0, the value of all of the input neurons was 0 (as for new-born
individuals) and a pool of 200 initial resources was attributed to each individual.
Procedure.
At each unit of time, several successive events occurred for each individual
(Fig 6):

 1. Calculation of the values of the output neurons: The value of the output neurons was calcu-
lated based on the values of the input neurons at time t and the set of synaptic weights of
the individual.
2. Acquisition of resources based on productivity: The flow rate of the resources available for the
population is limited, allowing to model competition and to limit population expansion.
Indeed, at each time unit, a pool of 20,000 units of resources was available and divided
between the individuals depending on their productivity (i.e., ability to extract resources
from the environment). The productivity of each individual is a function of the quantity
and quality of both somatic and cognitive capitals. The respective weights of somatic and
cognitive capital to determine productivity (P) were computed using the Cobb-Douglas
function [46]:
P ¼ Ka� 1:Ca
ð1Þ
where K is the somatic factor, C is the cognitive factor, and α is an ecological parameter
which defines the relative importance of the somatic and cognitive factors to determine the
ability to extract resources from the environment, given the ecological niche. As we defined
productivity as a product of the somatic and the cognitive factors, total compensation of
one type of resources by the other is not possible (e. g. a value of 0 for somatic capital cannot
be compensated by higher value for cognitive capital). K is defined as:
K ¼ Qsoma:qsoma
ð2Þ
where Q soma is the quantity of somatic capital, and q soma is the quality of the somatic capi-
tal. Quality of the somatic capital is thus to be understood as the proportion of somatic capi-
tal which is not degraded. C is defined as:
C ¼ Qcognitivet:qcognitivet:b:
R t
t¼0 Qcognitive:qcognitive
ð3Þ
where Q cognitive is the quantity of cognitive capital, q cognitive is the quality of the cognitive
capital, and β is the rate of skills acquisition. The integral term in Eq 3 represents the
delayed benefits of investing earlier in cognitive capital. Indeed, investing in brain perfor-
mance (i.e., quantity or quality of cognitive capital) at time t allows an individual to acquire
skills that will be useful in the future to acquire resources. Finally, P is transformed using a
sigmoid function of the following form:
P0 ¼
1
1 þ eg1:ðg2� PÞ �
1
1 þ eg1:g2
�
�
: 1 þ eg1:g2
eg1:g2
ð4Þ
where γ1 is the slope of the sigmoid function at the inflexion point and γ2 is the abscissa of
the inflexion point. We chose a sigmoid function to model the age-dependence of resource
acquisition. Indeed, in most mammals, including humans, young individuals are unable to
acquire resources by themselves. Then, they become increasingly efficient and finally, satu-
ration occurs. The sigmoid function has been scaled to have P’ = 0 when P = 0 and P’!1
when P!+1.
3. Acquisition of maternal resources: At age 0, an individual acquired only the resources which
her mother has allocated for direct reproduction. Later, an individual acquired the
resources that the mother had eventually allocated for maternal care.

 4. Growth: A proportion of the newly acquired resources, as determined by outputs (1) and
(3), was allocated to growth. This means that these resources were added to the quantity of
somatic and cognitive capital, respectively.
5. Depletion of the quality of somatic and cognitive capitals and investment for maintenance:
Without investment for maintenance, the quality of somatic and cognitive capital depreci-
ates over time due to environmental assaults and the accumulation of deleterious by-prod-
ucts of cell metabolism [25]. Indeed, at each time, the quality of both somatic and cognitive
capital decreases proportionally to their respective quantity. More precisely, the amount of
somatic capital which is not degraded (Qf) decreased at each unit of time following a func-
tion of the following form:
Qftþ1 ¼ Qft � Q:d þ Im
ð5Þ
where δ is the degradation rate (0 < δ <1) and Im is the amount of resources allocated for
maintenance. Then, the quality of capital (somatic or cognitive) is:
qt ¼ Qft=Q
ð6Þ
We assumed the same degradation rate for both somatic and cognitive capital.
6. Survival: The probability to survive from time t to time t+1 was a sigmoid function of allo-
cation in survival at time t:
s ¼
1
1 þ es1:ðs2� IsÞ �
1
1 þ es1:s2
�
�
: 1 þ es1:s2
es1:s2
ð7Þ
where σ1 is the slope of the sigmoid function at the inflexion point, σ2 is the abscissa of the
inflexion point, and Is is the quantity of resources invested in survival. The function has
been scaled to have s = 0 when Is = 0 and s!1 when Is !+1. This sigmoid function has
been chosen for similar reasons than in Eq (4). An individual who dies at time t cannot, at
the same time, allocate resources to other individuals (direct reproduction and parental
care).
7. Reproduction: If allocation to direct reproduction was higher than zero, the individual
reproduced. A new individual was thus added to the population, with the same synaptic
weights, except when mutation occurred. For each synaptic weight, the probability of muta-
tion was established as one divided by the total number of weights (1/141). When a muta-
tion occurred, it was either strong (with a probability of 0.1) and the new synaptic weight
was drawn from a uniform distribution ranging from -10 to 10, or it was weak (with a prob-
ability of 0.9) and the new synaptic weight was drawn from a normal distribution centered
on the previous value, with a standard deviation of 0.01.
8. Maternal care: The proportion of resources transmitted to each child was determined by
one distinct output per child.
2. Effects of the ecological parameters on PRLS
Preliminary exploration showed that increasing the amount of available resources at each time
unit, all else being equal, lead only to a proportional increase in population size, without
changing the average duration of post-reproductive period. This parameter was established at
20,000, resulting in population sizes of at least 500 individuals. A random value was attributed
to each of the five other parameters (α, β and δ were drawn from a uniform distribution

 between 0 and 1 and γ2 and σ2 from a uniform distribution between 0 and 200), and a simu-
lated population with an initial size of 1,000 individuals was allowed to evolve during 10,000
time units with these parameters. PRLS was measured as the average time interval between the
last reproduction and death, calculated over the individuals who were born and died during
the final 2,000 units of time. This process was repeated 100 times to detect the influence of
each parameter on the variation of PRLS.
3. Identification of the ecological parameters maximizing PRLS
The maximizing function “rbga” (package “genalg” [47]), implemented in R v3.2 [48], was
used to test whether at least one combination of ecological parameters lead to extensive PRLS
with our model. To this end, we identified the combination of ecological parameters values
able to promote the evolution of the longest PRLS, and we measured the average PRLS dura-
tion in a population which has evolved under these conditions. For each set of parameters (α,
β, δ, γ2 and σ2), a population with an initial size of 1,000 individuals was simulated and was
allowed to evolve during 10,000 units of time (or 20,000 units of time, without changing the
results). PRLS was the variable to be maximized in the space of parameter values. For each
combination of ecological parameters, a combination of synaptic weights evolved (i.e., became
the most frequent in the population). This procedure thus allowed identifying both the combi-
nation of ecological parameter values which led to the longest PRLS (referred to as EP�), and
the associated synaptic weights (referred to as the best weights).
To observe and describe the allocation strategy corresponding to the best weights, a popula-
tion with an initial size of 1,000 individuals was simulated using the EP�, with all individuals
having the best synaptic weights, without possible mutations. With these conditions, the demo-
graphic characteristics were allowed to freely evolve during 10,000 units of time (or 20,000 units
of time, without changing the results). Although individuals with the same synaptic weights
necessarily have a similar strategy, decisions could vary based on the local perceived conditions.
This step allowed a reduction in the inter-individual variation of realized life histories.
3. Testing the GMH and ECM for the emergence of menopause and
extensive PRLS
To test the GMH, the same procedure was performed with the outputs corresponding to allo-
cation in maternal care for a child who had already reproduced set to 0; grand-parenting was
thus no longer a possible allocation option. Indeed, as mentioned before, grand-parenting was
modeled in this study by allowing the individuals to adapt their parental investment for a
given child depending on its own number of children, rather than allowing direct resource
transfers to grandoffspring. If the GMH is determinant to explain the emergence of extensive
PRLS, we thus expected that it cannot emerge under this condition, whatever the combination
of ecological parameters. To test the ECM, the procedure was performed after removing
delayed benefits of investing in cognition from the model (i.e. the integral term and the β
parameter were removed from Eq 3). Indeed, without delayed benefits of investment, cognitive
resources were not differentiated from somatic resources in the model (i.e. both resources are
interchangeable and had the same properties).Strong delayed benefits of investment are a spec-
ificity of cognitive capital [12].Indeed, investing in neural development at time t promotes
accumulation of skills and experience all along the life. Returns from cognitive capital can thus
continue to increase (not only to be maintained) even after stopping investment in it. This is
not the case for somatic capital. Indeed, although investment in somatic capital at time t can
provide benefits later (for resource production, protection,. . .), these benefits will not increase
without further investment. Therefore, this procedure allowed testing for the relation between

 cognitive resources and the duration of PRLS. Indeed, without delayed benefits of investment,
cognitive resources were not differentiated from somatic resources in the model (i.e. both
resources are interchangeable and had the same properties). In addition, as resource transfers
are sometimes also provided by older siblings in humans, we also tested whether allowing
transfers between siblings change the results.
4. Cost analysis
To identify the costs of suppressed or reduced PRLS in a population where extensive PRLS has
already evolved, we simulated 200 populations with initial size of 1,000 individuals, where all
individuals had the same allocation strategy (best synaptic weights). We allowed each population
to evolve using the EP� during 20,000 units of time, without possible mutations. 100 populations
were attributed to condition 1: death at age of menopause, and the 100 other populations were
attributed to condition 2: one additional reproductive event at age of menopause. At t = 10,000,
we applied the condition to half of the individuals in each population. The condition was herita-
ble and was also applied to their offspring at each generation. No condition was applied to the
other individuals and their offspring (control). For each population, the proportion of individu-
als who received the condition among the successive generations, up to the 10th, was tested for a
significant departure from the expected frequency (0.5) using two-sided binomial tests (R-based
function binom.test). The average fertility and the proportion of individuals who survived until
reproduction were compared between the control and condition across the first ten generations
using two-sided student tests. The data fitted the requirements for these tests.
